Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. *(May 2023)*\n |\n\n\nChina's current mainly market economy features a high degree of income inequality. According to the Asian Development Bank Institute, “before China implemented reform and opening-up policies in 1978, its income distribution pattern was characterized as egalitarian in all aspects.”[1]\n\n\nA study published in the PNAS estimated that China's Gini coefficient increased from 0.30 to 0.55 between 1980 and 2002.[2] At this time, the Gini coefficient for rural – urban inequality was only 0.16. As of 2019[update], the official Gini coefficient in China was 0.465; inequality was at its highest in the 2000s, with numerous sources reporting a significant decline in the 2010s.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nIn a landmark paper published in the *Review of Development Economics*, economists Ravi Kanbur and Xiaobo Zhang conclude that there have been three peaks of inequality in China in the last fifty years, “coinciding with the Great Famine of the late 1950s, the Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s and 1970s, and finally the period of openness and global integration in the late 1990s.”[4] Their research indicates that these periods of inequality are driven by “three key policy variables – the ratio of heavy industry to gross output value, the degree of decentralization, and the degree of openness.”[4] The study finds that the “heavy-industry development strategy played a key role in forming the enormous rural-urban gap in the pre-reform period, while openness and decentralization contributed to the rapid increase in inland-coastal disparity in the reform period of the 1980s and 90s.” In other words, heavy industry development in the cities formed the initial rural-urban gap leading up to the reform period, and decentralization increased overall inequality, rural-urban inequality, and inland-coastal inequality as the economy opened up after the 1978 economic reforms.[4] Research conducted by Jeffrey Sachs on the entire period from 1952 to 1996 indicates that in general, regional income inequalities are driven by government policy, whereas income divergence is \"strongly associated with the extent of marketization and openness.\"[5]\n\n\n\n## Current state[edit]\n\n\nChina is a newly industrialized country and an emerging economy, with quarterly GDP growth rates averaging 9.31%[6] for the past two decades, powered mainly by strong exports. However, China still faces a number of socioeconomic issues, including the increasing income disparity between different groups of citizens, largely characterized by rural-urban income inequality. Despite steady growth of China's economy since economic reforms in 1978, the rural-urban income gap reached its widest in more than three decades in 2009.[7] According to data from National Bureau of Statistics of China, at its widest disparity, city dwellers were earning 3.33 times as much as farmers (income ratio of 3.33:1), with per capita disposable income of urban households standing at RMB17175 while per capita net income of rural households at RMB5153.[8] In contrast, the income disparity was at its narrowest in 1983, at 1.82:1, due to effects of the Household-responsibility system introduced in 1978.[9] As of year 2010, income ratio was recorded at 3.23:1 and per capita disposable income of urban households stood at RMB19109 while rural households’ were at RMB5919.[8] In 2014, according to an Institute of Social Science Survey, Peking University, income inequality among Chinese mainland citizens has reached severe conditions, with 1% of the Chinese population possessing 1/3 of the country's wealth.[10] The existing high income inequality in China is primarily attributed to structural factors inherent in the Chinese political system, with the principal structural drivers being the urban-rural disparity and regional disparities in economic prosperity.[11]\n\n\nIn 2012, a report published by Southwestern University of Finance and Economics estimated the Gini index of China at 0.61[12]\n\n\nChina's government publishes an official yearly calculation of the country's Gini index. According to these reports, the average Gini coefficient between residents was .475 between the years of 2003 and 2018, reaching a high of 0.491 in 2008 and a low of 0.462 in 2015.[13] In 2019, China's official Gini coefficient was 0.465; various sources have debated the accuracy of this data, with the World Bank calculating 0.385 (2016) after factoring cheaper prices in rural areas while the World Inequality Database reporting higher numbers after factoring in pre-tax income and unreported income of richer segments. However, it is generally agreed among sources that China's inequality decreased significantly in the 2010s.[3]\n\n\n\n## Factors[edit]\n\n\n### Urban-biased policies[edit]\n\n\nMore than 10% of China's total inequality is attributed to the rural-urban gap, according to a study published in the PNAS.[2] Research conducted by Dennis Tao Yang published in the journal of the American Economic Association indicates that the root of China's rural-urban divide “lies in the strategy of the centrally planned system that favored heavy-industry development and extracted agricultural surplus largely for urban capital accumulation and urban-based subsidies.”[14] In the 1980s and 1990s, state investments in the rural economy accounted for “less than 10 percent of the budget, despite the fact that the rural population was about 73-76 percent of the national population.”[14] Additionally, factor market distortions have created significant rural-urban inequalities. More specifically, research published in the *Journal of Economic Modelling* demonstrates that the Hukou system and absence of a fully functioning land market are two main drivers of rural-urban inequality.[15]\n\n\n\n### Inland-coastal inequality[edit]\n\n\nAs is well documented in many studies, rural-urban inequality is a major contributing factor to general income inequality in China. However, “while the contribution of rural-urban inequality is much higher than that of inland-coastal inequality in terms of levels, the trend is very different. The rural-urban contribution has not changed very much over time, but the inland-coastal contribution has increased by several fold,” meaning that inland-coastal inequality is playing an increasingly important role in the formation of general income inequality across China.[16] A study found that variations across Chinese provinces account for about 12% of the country's overall income inequality.[17] Research on economic growth after the opening of the Chinese economy has shown that between 1989 and 2004, income in coastal provinces more than tripled whilst that in inland provinces doubled.[18] Research on inland-coastal inequality indicates that \"since being a coastal province is a geographic advantage that will persist, this tendency for divergence will also probably continue,\" but institutional factors still have a significant effect.[5] Economists Ravi Kanbur and Xiao Zhang propose that the “greater ease of rural-to-urban migration within provinces, compared to the institutional and other difficulties of migrating from inland to coastal provinces” can partially explain this phenomenon.[16] China's Hukou system (户口) is an institutional factor that significantly inhibits interprovincial migration. Recently, the government has introduced policies that relax Hukou related restrictions in small and medium-sized cities, in an effort to encourage growth.[19] “Currently rural incomes are less equally distributed than urban incomes but urban inequality is increasing faster than rural inequality” (Wu, 2005, p. 773).[20]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nAccording to research conducted at the World Bank, “inequality of access to education is an important source of inequality in China across people contemporaneously and across generations.”[18] In fact, “a decomposition analysis based on household income determination shows that the largest proportion of changes in total income can be attributed to the increase in returns to education.”[18] Urban-biased policies and inland-coastal inequality exacerbates the issue of education inequality in China. One of the primary issues is their generation of sector-biased income transfers and expenditures on health, housing and education, which \"not only distort economic incentives of the workers in the sectors, but will also affect the human-capital attainments of their children, which may further widen the rural-urban income gap.\"[14] In other words, inland and rural inequality can help create a vicious cycle by funneling money towards the coastal cities and away from investments in human capital elsewhere. Like in the United States, education funding is primarily the responsibility of local governments in China. As poor localities are less able to fund these services and poor households are less able to afford the high private cost of basic education, China has seen an increase in the inequality of education outcomes. “For example, in 1998, per pupil expenditure in Beijing was 12 times that in Guizhou, and the difference jumped to 15 times in 2001.”[18]\n\n\n\n### Demographic Change[edit]\n\n\nAccording to research published in the China Economic Review, population aging is “largely responsible for the sharp increase in income inequality in rural China,” especially at the beginning of the 2000s.[21] As a result of Chinese governmental attempts to control population growth with the one-child policy implemented in 1979, many fewer young adults have reached the working age over the course of the past decade, leading to a significant “fall in the ratio of household members of working age.” This created a labor shortage, which in combination with the rapid expansion of industrialization served to increase income inequality.[21] Beyond income inequality, this research also indicates that “an imbalanced population structure will influence the social and economic development in many other respects.” The researchers recommend serious reconsideration of the one-child policy to mitigate these effects. Recently in 2019, measures to redact or modify the one-child policy have been reviewed and ratified to be put into place. Its ramifications and consequences yet to be seen.\n\n\n\n## Impact[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2009, a survey conducted by the *Economy and Nation Weekly* magazine of Xinhua news revealed that 34 out of the 50 leading Chinese economists surveyed think of income inequality as a challenge to China's sustainable development.[9] Economist Kenneth Rogoff also cautioned on the problem of income inequality, commenting that “There is no doubt that income inequality is the single biggest threat to social stability around the world, whether it is in the United States, the European periphery, or China.”[22] Income inequality is argued to be a menace to social stability, and potentially causes a disappearance of middle class capital that would impede China's economic growth.[23]\n\n\n“Hu Angang, an influential researcher in China, warned that further increases in regional disparities may lead to China’s dissolution, like in the former Yugoslavia,” while other scholars have noted that “further expansions of the differences may create serious social and political problems, generate nationalist conflicts and negatively influence China’s economic and social stability.”[16]\n“The current institutions and policies are detrimental to China’s future growth because the sector-biased income transfers and expenditures on health, housing, and education not only distort economic incentives of the workers in the sectors, but will also affect the human-capital attainments of their children, which may further widen the rural-urban income gap.”[14] In other words, current income inequality created largely as a result of government policy favoring urban centers begets further rural-urban income inequality, which creates a vicious cycle and further reinforces regional and rural-urban inequalities.\n\n\n\n## Policy recommendations[edit]\n\n\n### Economic reform[edit]\n\n\n Research published by the International Monetary Fund indicates that “continuing with the current growth pattern would further increase already high investment and saving needs to unsustainable levels, lower urban employment growth, and widen the rural-urban income gap.”[24] Instead, they recommend reducing subsidies to industry and investment, encouraging the development of the services industry, and reducing barriers to labor mobility, believing that this would result in a “more balanced growth with an investment-to-GDP ratio that is consistent with medium-term saving trends, faster growth in urban employment, and a substantial reduction in the income gap between rural and urban residents.”[24] With regard to labor mobility reform, research published in the journal of Economic Modelling suggests that reforms in the rural land rental market and Hukou system alongside efforts to increase off-farm labor mobility would dramatically reduce the urban-rural income ratio. Additionally, the research states that “the combination of WTO accession and factor market reforms improves both efficiency and equality significantly.”[15] WTO accession means that the economy will become more liberalized and open, “likely resulting in dramatic shifts in regional comparative advantages.”[4] This regional disparity will likely be exacerbated by continued government investment in coastal regions, so “further liberalizing and investing in the economy in the inland region is thus an important developmental strategy for the government to both promote economic growth and reduce regional inequality.”[4]\n\n\n\n### Social policy reform[edit]\n\n\nAnalysis of the impact of the one-child policy indicates that “population aging will impact society in multiple ways, and it is therefore crucial for policy makers to produce a development strategy that tackles the socio-economic challenges of an aging population.”[21] Some specific recommendations from the School of Public Finance and Public Policy of Beijing include “the establishment of a basic old age security system in rural areas” to reduce income inequality, encouragement of development of local industry in less affluent regions, subsidization of children's education in lower income households, and the establishment of public health insurance plans for the poor.” Additionally, the report finds that “In the long run, the Chinese government should reconsider whether the one-child policy should be continued. As an interim policy, it has achieved its objective, and now is the time for adjusting the policy.”[21]\n Research from the World Bank indicates that while inequality of income can be inevitable at certain stages of development, inequality of opportunity will undermine long-term development prospects. In order to enhance growth and fight poverty, it will therefore be important to improve access to basic education, especially in poor rural areas.[18]\n\n\n\n### Fiscal policy reform[edit]\n\n\nChina already has a tax and redistribution system. It is divided into 9 income groups. The first bracket for salaries exceeding 800 yuan (or US$96.4) is taxed at 5%, the last bracket for incomes exceeding 100,000 yuan (or US$12,000) is taxed at 45%. \nThere is also a tax system for craftsmen. This one is based on 5 tranches and not 9. The highest rate is 35%.[25]\nHowever, it seems that this tax system cannot really be effective in reducing inequalities. This is for several reasons. \nChina faces significant corruption problems that make this tax system illegitimate and difficult to enforce. Tax payers consider that the taxes they pay will go to a privileged minority, which is why, in practice, this tax system is not legitimate.[26]\n\n\nCorruption is already a major issue for China. According to a study, 50% of state-owned companies, 60% of joint venture companies and 100% of craftsmen practice tax evasion in China. In the 1980s, commercial and industrial evasion increased considerably to reach 100 billion yuan in 1989, or about 10% of national income. Income tax evasion reached 95%,[27] according to Ministry of Security sources between 1985 and 1988 there were 8900 cases of tax revolt, 1500 tax inspectors were injured, 872 were in critical condition, 28 were disabled, and 4 died. During the first six months of 1990, there were 1352 cases of tax revolts, 1047 tax inspectors injured, 127 critically ill and disabled, and 3 dead.[28] In 1992 and 1993, there were 2744 and 2967 violent events against payment of taxes respectively.[29]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Poverty in China\n* Economy of China\n* Education in China\n* Social issues in China\n* Income tax in China\n\n\n## Further reading[edit]\n\n\n* Kanbur, Ravi; Fan, Shenggen; Wei, Shang-Jin; Zhang, Xiaobo (2014). *The Oxford companion to the economics of China*.

According to the Asian Development Bank Institute, “before China implemented reform and opening-up policies in 1978, its income distribution pattern was characterized as egalitarian in all aspects.”[1]\n\n\nA study published in the PNAS estimated that China's Gini coefficient increased from 0.30 to 0.55 between 1980 and 2002.[2] At this time, the Gini coefficient for rural – urban inequality was only 0.16. As of 2019[update], the official Gini coefficient in China was 0.465; inequality was at its highest in the 2000s, with numerous sources reporting a significant decline in the 2010s.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nIn a landmark paper published in the *Review of Development Economics*, economists Ravi Kanbur and Xiaobo Zhang conclude that there have been three peaks of inequality in China in the last fifty years, “coinciding with the Great Famine of the late 1950s, the Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s and 1970s, and finally the period of openness and global integration in the late 1990s.”[4] Their research indicates that these periods of inequality are driven by “three key policy variables – the ratio of heavy industry to gross output value, the degree of decentralization, and the degree of openness.”[4] The study finds that the “heavy-industry development strategy played a key role in forming the enormous rural-urban gap in the pre-reform period, while openness and decentralization contributed to the rapid increase in inland-coastal disparity in the reform period of the 1980s and 90s.” In other words, heavy industry development in the cities formed the initial rural-urban gap leading up to the reform period, and decentralization increased overall inequality, rural-urban inequality, and inland-coastal inequality as the economy opened up after the 1978 economic reforms.[4] Research conducted by Jeffrey Sachs on the entire period from 1952 to 1996 indicates that in general, regional income inequalities are driven by government policy, whereas income divergence is \"strongly associated with the extent of marketization and openness.\"[5]\n\n\n\n## Current state[edit]\n\n\nChina is a newly industrialized country and an emerging economy, with quarterly GDP growth rates averaging 9.31%[6] for the past two decades, powered mainly by strong exports. However, China still faces a number of socioeconomic issues, including the increasing income disparity between different groups of citizens, largely characterized by rural-urban income inequality. Despite steady growth of China's economy since economic reforms in 1978, the rural-urban income gap reached its widest in more than three decades in 2009.[7] According to data from National Bureau of Statistics of China, at its widest disparity, city dwellers were earning 3.33 times as much as farmers (income ratio of 3.33:1), with per capita disposable income of urban households standing at RMB17175 while per capita net income of rural households at RMB5153.[8] In contrast, the income disparity was at its narrowest in 1983, at 1.82:1, due to effects of the Household-responsibility system introduced in 1978.[9] As of year 2010, income ratio was recorded at 3.23:1 and per capita disposable income of urban households stood at RMB19109 while rural households’ were at RMB5919.[8] In 2014, according to an Institute of Social Science Survey, Peking University, income inequality among Chinese mainland citizens has reached severe conditions, with 1% of the Chinese population possessing 1/3 of the country's wealth.[10] The existing high income inequality in China is primarily attributed to structural factors inherent in the Chinese political system, with the principal structural drivers being the urban-rural disparity and regional disparities in economic prosperity.[11]\n\n\nIn 2012, a report published by Southwestern University of Finance and Economics estimated the Gini index of China at 0.61[12]\n\n\nChina's government publishes an official yearly calculation of the country's Gini index. According to these reports, the average Gini coefficient between residents was .475 between the years of 2003 and 2018, reaching a high of 0.491 in 2008 and a low of 0.462 in 2015.[13] In 2019, China's official Gini coefficient was 0.465; various sources have debated the accuracy of this data, with the World Bank calculating 0.385 (2016) after factoring cheaper prices in rural areas while the World Inequality Database reporting higher numbers after factoring in pre-tax income and unreported income of richer segments. However, it is generally agreed among sources that China's inequality decreased significantly in the 2010s.[3]\n\n\n\n## Factors[edit]\n\n\n### Urban-biased policies[edit]\n\n\nMore than 10% of China's total inequality is attributed to the rural-urban gap, according to a study published in the PNAS.[2] Research conducted by Dennis Tao Yang published in the journal of the American Economic Association indicates that the root of China's rural-urban divide “lies in the strategy of the centrally planned system that favored heavy-industry development and extracted agricultural surplus largely for urban capital accumulation and urban-based subsidies.”[14] In the 1980s and 1990s, state investments in the rural economy accounted for “less than 10 percent of the budget, despite the fact that the rural population was about 73-76 percent of the national population.”[14] Additionally, factor market distortions have created significant rural-urban inequalities. More specifically, research published in the *Journal of Economic Modelling* demonstrates that the Hukou system and absence of a fully functioning land market are two main drivers of rural-urban inequality.[15]\n\n\n\n### Inland-coastal inequality[edit]\n\n\nAs is well documented in many studies, rural-urban inequality is a major contributing factor to general income inequality in China. However, “while the contribution of rural-urban inequality is much higher than that of inland-coastal inequality in terms of levels, the trend is very different. The rural-urban contribution has not changed very much over time, but the inland-coastal contribution has increased by several fold,” meaning that inland-coastal inequality is playing an increasingly important role in the formation of general income inequality across China.[16] A study found that variations across Chinese provinces account for about 12% of the country's overall income inequality.[17] Research on economic growth after the opening of the Chinese economy has shown that between 1989 and 2004, income in coastal provinces more than tripled whilst that in inland provinces doubled.[18] Research on inland-coastal inequality indicates that \"since being a coastal province is a geographic advantage that will persist, this tendency for divergence will also probably continue,\" but institutional factors still have a significant effect.[5] Economists Ravi Kanbur and Xiao Zhang propose that the “greater ease of rural-to-urban migration within provinces, compared to the institutional and other difficulties of migrating from inland to coastal provinces” can partially explain this phenomenon.[16] China's Hukou system (户口) is an institutional factor that significantly inhibits interprovincial migration. Recently, the government has introduced policies that relax Hukou related restrictions in small and medium-sized cities, in an effort to encourage growth.[19] “Currently rural incomes are less equally distributed than urban incomes but urban inequality is increasing faster than rural inequality” (Wu, 2005, p. 773).[20]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nAccording to research conducted at the World Bank, “inequality of access to education is an important source of inequality in China across people contemporaneously and across generations.”[18] In fact, “a decomposition analysis based on household income determination shows that the largest proportion of changes in total income can be attributed to the increase in returns to education.”[18] Urban-biased policies and inland-coastal inequality exacerbates the issue of education inequality in China. One of the primary issues is their generation of sector-biased income transfers and expenditures on health, housing and education, which \"not only distort economic incentives of the workers in the sectors, but will also affect the human-capital attainments of their children, which may further widen the rural-urban income gap.\"[14] In other words, inland and rural inequality can help create a vicious cycle by funneling money towards the coastal cities and away from investments in human capital elsewhere. Like in the United States, education funding is primarily the responsibility of local governments in China. As poor localities are less able to fund these services and poor households are less able to afford the high private cost of basic education, China has seen an increase in the inequality of education outcomes. “For example, in 1998, per pupil expenditure in Beijing was 12 times that in Guizhou, and the difference jumped to 15 times in 2001.”[18]\n\n\n\n### Demographic Change[edit]\n\n\nAccording to research published in the China Economic Review, population aging is “largely responsible for the sharp increase in income inequality in rural China,” especially at the beginning of the 2000s.[21] As a result of Chinese governmental attempts to control population growth with the one-child policy implemented in 1979, many fewer young adults have reached the working age over the course of the past decade, leading to a significant “fall in the ratio of household members of working age.” This created a labor shortage, which in combination with the rapid expansion of industrialization served to increase income inequality.[21] Beyond income inequality, this research also indicates that “an imbalanced population structure will influence the social and economic development in many other respects.” The researchers recommend serious reconsideration of the one-child policy to mitigate these effects. Recently in 2019, measures to redact or modify the one-child policy have been reviewed and ratified to be put into place. Its ramifications and consequences yet to be seen.\n\n\n\n## Impact[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2009, a survey conducted by the *Economy and Nation Weekly* magazine of Xinhua news revealed that 34 out of the 50 leading Chinese economists surveyed think of income inequality as a challenge to China's sustainable development.[9] Economist Kenneth Rogoff also cautioned on the problem of income inequality, commenting that “There is no doubt that income inequality is the single biggest threat to social stability around the world, whether it is in the United States, the European periphery, or China.”[22] Income inequality is argued to be a menace to social stability, and potentially causes a disappearance of middle class capital that would impede China's economic growth.[23]\n\n\n“Hu Angang, an influential researcher in China, warned that further increases in regional disparities may lead to China’s dissolution, like in the former Yugoslavia,” while other scholars have noted that “further expansions of the differences may create serious social and political problems, generate nationalist conflicts and negatively influence China’s economic and social stability.”[16]\n“The current institutions and policies are detrimental to China’s future growth because the sector-biased income transfers and expenditures on health, housing, and education not only distort economic incentives of the workers in the sectors, but will also affect the human-capital attainments of their children, which may further widen the rural-urban income gap.”[14] In other words, current income inequality created largely as a result of government policy favoring urban centers begets further rural-urban income inequality, which creates a vicious cycle and further reinforces regional and rural-urban inequalities.\n\n\n\n## Policy recommendations[edit]\n\n\n### Economic reform[edit]\n\n\n Research published by the International Monetary Fund indicates that “continuing with the current growth pattern would further increase already high investment and saving needs to unsustainable levels, lower urban employment growth, and widen the rural-urban income gap.”[24] Instead, they recommend reducing subsidies to industry and investment, encouraging the development of the services industry, and reducing barriers to labor mobility, believing that this would result in a “more balanced growth with an investment-to-GDP ratio that is consistent with medium-term saving trends, faster growth in urban employment, and a substantial reduction in the income gap between rural and urban residents.”[24] With regard to labor mobility reform, research published in the journal of Economic Modelling suggests that reforms in the rural land rental market and Hukou system alongside efforts to increase off-farm labor mobility would dramatically reduce the urban-rural income ratio. Additionally, the research states that “the combination of WTO accession and factor market reforms improves both efficiency and equality significantly.”[15] WTO accession means that the economy will become more liberalized and open, “likely resulting in dramatic shifts in regional comparative advantages.”[4] This regional disparity will likely be exacerbated by continued government investment in coastal regions, so “further liberalizing and investing in the economy in the inland region is thus an important developmental strategy for the government to both promote economic growth and reduce regional inequality.”[4]\n\n\n\n### Social policy reform[edit]\n\n\nAnalysis of the impact of the one-child policy indicates that “population aging will impact society in multiple ways, and it is therefore crucial for policy makers to produce a development strategy that tackles the socio-economic challenges of an aging population.”[21] Some specific recommendations from the School of Public Finance and Public Policy of Beijing include “the establishment of a basic old age security system in rural areas” to reduce income inequality, encouragement of development of local industry in less affluent regions, subsidization of children's education in lower income households, and the establishment of public health insurance plans for the poor.” Additionally, the report finds that “In the long run, the Chinese government should reconsider whether the one-child policy should be continued. As an interim policy, it has achieved its objective, and now is the time for adjusting the policy.”[21]\n Research from the World Bank indicates that while inequality of income can be inevitable at certain stages of development, inequality of opportunity will undermine long-term development prospects. In order to enhance growth and fight poverty, it will therefore be important to improve access to basic education, especially in poor rural areas.[18]\n\n\n\n### Fiscal policy reform[edit]\n\n\nChina already has a tax and redistribution system. It is divided into 9 income groups. The first bracket for salaries exceeding 800 yuan (or US$96.4) is taxed at 5%, the last bracket for incomes exceeding 100,000 yuan (or US$12,000) is taxed at 45%. \nThere is also a tax system for craftsmen. This one is based on 5 tranches and not 9. The highest rate is 35%.[25]\nHowever, it seems that this tax system cannot really be effective in reducing inequalities. This is for several reasons. \nChina faces significant corruption problems that make this tax system illegitimate and difficult to enforce. Tax payers consider that the taxes they pay will go to a privileged minority, which is why, in practice, this tax system is not legitimate.[26]\n\n\nCorruption is already a major issue for China. According to a study, 50% of state-owned companies, 60% of joint venture companies and 100% of craftsmen practice tax evasion in China. In the 1980s, commercial and industrial evasion increased considerably to reach 100 billion yuan in 1989, or about 10% of national income. Income tax evasion reached 95%,[27] according to Ministry of Security sources between 1985 and 1988 there were 8900 cases of tax revolt, 1500 tax inspectors were injured, 872 were in critical condition, 28 were disabled, and 4 died. During the first six months of 1990, there were 1352 cases of tax revolts, 1047 tax inspectors injured, 127 critically ill and disabled, and 3 dead.[28] In 1992 and 1993, there were 2744 and 2967 violent events against payment of taxes respectively.[29]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Poverty in China\n* Economy of China\n* Education in China\n* Social issues in China\n* Income tax in China\n\n\n## Further reading[edit]\n\n\n* Kanbur, Ravi; Fan, Shenggen; Wei, Shang-Jin; Zhang, Xiaobo (2014). *The Oxford companion to the economics of China*.

According to the CIA World Factbook, the Gini coefficient of India, which is a measure of income distribution inequality, was 35.2 in 2011, ranking 95th out of 157.[2] Wealth distribution is also uneven, with one report estimating that 54% of the country's wealth is controlled by millionaires, the second highest after Russia, as of November 2016.[3] The richest 1% of Indians own 58% of wealth, while the richest 10% of Indians own 80% of the wealth. This trend has consistently increased, meaning the rich are getting richer much faster than the poor, widening the income gap.[3] Inequality worsened since the establishment of income tax in 1922, overtaking the British Raj's record of the share of the top 1% in national income, which was 20.7% in 1939–40.[4]According to Oxfam India's report of 2023, \"Survival of the Richest: India Story,\" just 5 per cent of Indians own more than 60 per cent of the country’s wealth, while the bottom 50 per cent of the population possess only 3 per cent of the wealth. It also says that between 2012 and 2021, 40% of wealth generated in India has gone to just 1% of the total population and 3% of the wealth has gone to bottom 50%. The number of hungry Indians increased to 350 million in 2022 from 190 million in 2018, while the number of billionaires has increased from 102 in 2020 to 166 in 2022. The covid pandemic reduced the income of the poor, but the wealthy did well. The combined wealth of India's 100 richest is now above $600 billion, which is equivalent to India's Union Budget for 18 months. According to Union Government 's own submission to Supreme Court of India, widespread hunger has caused 65% of deaths of children under the age of 5 in 2022.[1]Saurabh Mukherjee, the founder and CIO of Marcellus Investment Managers, along with his colleague Nandita Rajhansa, has coined the term \"Octopus Class\" to depict 2 lakh families or around 1 million people in India who control 80% of India's wealth. This class has consolidated financial, social and political power and has continuously pushed its 'tentacles' in every profitable activity they are interested in, aided by liberalisation and consequent growth of globalised economy since 1991.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Income gaps[edit]\n\n\nAccording to Thomas Piketty, it is difficult to accurately measure wealth inequality in India because of large gaps in income tax data. Official data from 1997-2000 contained many inconsistencies, while no data was published between 2000-2012. Then, in 2013, official income tax figures showed that only 1% of Indians paid tax that year, while only 2% filed a tax return. This lack of reliable data makes it essentially impossible to make significant, numerical conclusions about income inequality in India.[5][6]\n\n\nSince much of the population is not represented in income-tax databases, most of the calculations (such as NSSO) are based on consumption-expenditure data instead of income data.[7] According to the World Bank, the Gini coefficient in India was 0.339 in 2009,[8] down from previous values of 0.43 (1995–96) and 0.45 (2004–05).[9] However, in 2016, the International Monetary Fund, in its regional economic outlook for Asia and the Pacific, said that India’s Gini coefficient *rose* from 0.45 (1990) to 0.51 (2013).[10]\n\n\nAccording to the 2015 World Wealth Report, India had 198,000 high-net-worth individuals with a combined wealth of $785 billion.[11]\n\n\n\n### Class divide[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year | Minimum Net Worth(000 rupees) | Population\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1687 | 117 | 7000\n |\n| 1700 | 124 | 6,172\n |\n| 1725 | 124 | 6,820\n |\n| 1750 | 120 | 7,469\n |\n| 1775 | 120 | 8,117\n |\n| 1800 | 129 | 8,765\n |\n| 1825 | 128 |  |\n| 1850 | 128 | 4,605\n |\n| 1875 | 136 | 2,667\n |\n| 1900 | 228 | 3,104\n |\n| 1925 | 759 | 4,109\n |\n| 1950 | 2,057 | 4,968\n |\n| 1975 | 6,784 | 12,561\n |\n| 2000 | 49,457 | 43,267\n |\n| 2021 | 160,062 | 147,717\n |\n\n\n*Credit Suisse’s Global Wealth Databook* for 2014 reports that the bottom 10% of the Indian society owned merely 0.2% of national wealth,[12] while the richest 10% have been getting steadily richer since 2000.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Social Class (%) | Wealth Share (%)\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Bottom 10 | 0.2\n |\n| 10 - 20 | 0.4\n |\n| 20 - 30 | 0.8\n |\n| 30 - 40 | 1.3\n |\n| 40 - 50 | 1.8\n |\n| 50 - 60 | 2.6\n |\n| 60 - 70 | 3.8\n |\n| 70 - 80 | 5.7\n |\n| 80 - 90 | 9.4\n |\n| Top 10 *Top 1* | 74 *41* |\n\n\n## Causes[edit]\n\n\nN. C. Saxena, a member of the National Advisory Council, suggested that the widening income disparity can be accounted for by India's badly shaped agricultural and rural safety nets. \"Unfortunately, agriculture is in a state of collapse. Per capita food production is going down. Rural infrastructure such as power, road transport facilities are in a poor state,\" he said. \"All the safety net programmes are not working at all, with rural job scheme and public distribution system performing far below their potential. This has added to the suffering of rural India while market forces are acting in favour of urban India, which is why it is progressing at a faster rate.\"[13]\n\n\n\n## Impact[edit]\n\n\nIndia's economy continues to grow with its GDP rising faster than most nations. But a rise in national GDP is not indicative of income equality in the country. The growing income inequality in India has negatively impacted poor citizens' access to education and healthcare. Rising income inequality makes it difficult for the poor to climb up the economic ladder and increases their risk of being victims to poverty trap.[14] People living at the bottom 10% are characterized by low wages; long working hours; lack of basic services such as first aid, drinking water and sanitation.[9]\n\n\n[15][16]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Human Development Index\". *Human Development Reports*.

According to the CIA World Factbook, the Gini coefficient of India, which is a measure of income distribution inequality, was 35.2 in 2011, ranking 95th out of 157.[2] Wealth distribution is also uneven, with one report estimating that 54% of the country's wealth is controlled by millionaires, the second highest after Russia, as of November 2016.[3] The richest 1% of Indians own 58% of wealth, while the richest 10% of Indians own 80% of the wealth. This trend has consistently increased, meaning the rich are getting richer much faster than the poor, widening the income gap.[3] Inequality worsened since the establishment of income tax in 1922, overtaking the British Raj's record of the share of the top 1% in national income, which was 20.7% in 1939–40.[4]According to Oxfam India's report of 2023, \"Survival of the Richest: India Story,\" just 5 per cent of Indians own more than 60 per cent of the country’s wealth, while the bottom 50 per cent of the population possess only 3 per cent of the wealth. It also says that between 2012 and 2021, 40% of wealth generated in India has gone to just 1% of the total population and 3% of the wealth has gone to bottom 50%. The number of hungry Indians increased to 350 million in 2022 from 190 million in 2018, while the number of billionaires has increased from 102 in 2020 to 166 in 2022. The covid pandemic reduced the income of the poor, but the wealthy did well. The combined wealth of India's 100 richest is now above $600 billion, which is equivalent to India's Union Budget for 18 months. According to Union Government 's own submission to Supreme Court of India, widespread hunger has caused 65% of deaths of children under the age of 5 in 2022.[1]Saurabh Mukherjee, the founder and CIO of Marcellus Investment Managers, along with his colleague Nandita Rajhansa, has coined the term \"Octopus Class\" to depict 2 lakh families or around 1 million people in India who control 80% of India's wealth. This class has consolidated financial, social and political power and has continuously pushed its 'tentacles' in every profitable activity they are interested in, aided by liberalisation and consequent growth of globalised economy since 1991.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Income gaps[edit]\n\n\nAccording to Thomas Piketty, it is difficult to accurately measure wealth inequality in India because of large gaps in income tax data. Official data from 1997-2000 contained many inconsistencies, while no data was published between 2000-2012. Then, in 2013, official income tax figures showed that only 1% of Indians paid tax that year, while only 2% filed a tax return. This lack of reliable data makes it essentially impossible to make significant, numerical conclusions about income inequality in India.[5][6]\n\n\nSince much of the population is not represented in income-tax databases, most of the calculations (such as NSSO) are based on consumption-expenditure data instead of income data.[7] According to the World Bank, the Gini coefficient in India was 0.339 in 2009,[8] down from previous values of 0.43 (1995–96) and 0.45 (2004–05).[9] However, in 2016, the International Monetary Fund, in its regional economic outlook for Asia and the Pacific, said that India’s Gini coefficient *rose* from 0.45 (1990) to 0.51 (2013).[10]\n\n\nAccording to the 2015 World Wealth Report, India had 198,000 high-net-worth individuals with a combined wealth of $785 billion.[11]\n\n\n\n### Class divide[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year | Minimum Net Worth(000 rupees) | Population\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1687 | 117 | 7000\n |\n| 1700 | 124 | 6,172\n |\n| 1725 | 124 | 6,820\n |\n| 1750 | 120 | 7,469\n |\n| 1775 | 120 | 8,117\n |\n| 1800 | 129 | 8,765\n |\n| 1825 | 128 |  |\n| 1850 | 128 | 4,605\n |\n| 1875 | 136 | 2,667\n |\n| 1900 | 228 | 3,104\n |\n| 1925 | 759 | 4,109\n |\n| 1950 | 2,057 | 4,968\n |\n| 1975 | 6,784 | 12,561\n |\n| 2000 | 49,457 | 43,267\n |\n| 2021 | 160,062 | 147,717\n |\n\n\n*Credit Suisse’s Global Wealth Databook* for 2014 reports that the bottom 10% of the Indian society owned merely 0.2% of national wealth,[12] while the richest 10% have been getting steadily richer since 2000.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Social Class (%) | Wealth Share (%)\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Bottom 10 | 0.2\n |\n| 10 - 20 | 0.4\n |\n| 20 - 30 | 0.8\n |\n| 30 - 40 | 1.3\n |\n| 40 - 50 | 1.8\n |\n| 50 - 60 | 2.6\n |\n| 60 - 70 | 3.8\n |\n| 70 - 80 | 5.7\n |\n| 80 - 90 | 9.4\n |\n| Top 10 *Top 1* | 74 *41* |\n\n\n## Causes[edit]\n\n\nN. C. Saxena, a member of the National Advisory Council, suggested that the widening income disparity can be accounted for by India's badly shaped agricultural and rural safety nets. \"Unfortunately, agriculture is in a state of collapse. Per capita food production is going down. Rural infrastructure such as power, road transport facilities are in a poor state,\" he said. \"All the safety net programmes are not working at all, with rural job scheme and public distribution system performing far below their potential. This has added to the suffering of rural India while market forces are acting in favour of urban India, which is why it is progressing at a faster rate.\"[13]\n\n\n\n## Impact[edit]\n\n\nIndia's economy continues to grow with its GDP rising faster than most nations. But a rise in national GDP is not indicative of income equality in the country. The growing income inequality in India has negatively impacted poor citizens' access to education and healthcare. Rising income inequality makes it difficult for the poor to climb up the economic ladder and increases their risk of being victims to poverty trap.[14] People living at the bottom 10% are characterized by low wages; long working hours; lack of basic services such as first aid, drinking water and sanitation.[9]\n\n\n[15][16]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Human Development Index\". *Human Development Reports*.

In 2021, Kazakhstan attracted more than US$370 billion of foreign investments since becoming an independent republic after the collapse of the former Soviet Union.[18]\n\n\nIt possesses oil reserves as well as minerals and metals. It also has considerable agricultural potential, with its vast steppe lands accommodating both livestock and grain production. The mountains in the south are important for apples and walnuts; both species grow wild there. Kazakhstan's industrial sector rests on the extraction and processing of these natural resources.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe Dissolution of the Soviet Union and the collapse of demand for Kazakhstan's traditional heavy industry products have resulted in a sharp decline of the economy since 1991, with the steepest annual decline occurring in 1994. In 1995–97 the pace of the government program of economic reform and privatization quickened, resulting in a substantial shifting of assets into the private sector. Kazakhstan was granted \"market economy country\" status by the European Union and the United States, in 2000 and 2002 respectively.[19]\n\n\nThe December 1996 signing of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium agreement to build a new pipeline from western Kazakhstan's Tengiz Field through Russia to the Black Sea increased prospects for substantially larger oil exports until Putin took issue with the lukewarm support he experienced in the wake of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine from Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. Kazakhstan's economy turned downward in 1998 with a 2.5% decline in GDP growth due to slumping oil prices and the August financial crisis in Russia. A bright spot in 1999 was the recovery of international petroleum prices, which, combined with a well-timed tenge devaluation and a bumper grain harvest, pulled the economy out of recession.\n\n\nGDP per capita shrank by 26% in the 1990s.[20] In the 2000s, Kazakhstan's economy grew sharply, aided by increased prices on world markets for Kazakhstan's leading exports: oil, metals and grain. GDP grew 9.6% in 2000, up from 1.7% in 1999. In 2006, extremely high GDP growth had been sustained, and grew by 10.6%.[21] Business with the booming economies of Russia and China, as well as neighboring Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) nations have helped to propel this growth. The increased economic growth also led to a turn-around in government finances, with the budget moving from a cash deficit of 3.7% of GDP in 1999 to 0.1% surplus in 2000. The country experienced a slowdown in economic growth from 2014, sparked by falling oil prices and the effects of the Russo-Ukrainian War.[22] The country's currency was devalued by 19% in 2014 and by 22% in 2015.\n\n\nIn 2017, the World Economic Forum compiled its Global Competitiveness Ranking, ranking Kazakhstan 57th out of 144 countries.[23] The ranking considers multiple macroeconomic and financial factors, such as market size, GDP, tax rates, infrastructure development, etc.[24] In 2012, the World Economic Forum listed corruption as the biggest problem in doing business in the country,[25] while the World Bank listed Kazakhstan as a corruption hotspot, on a par with Angola, Bolivia, Kenya, Libya and Pakistan.[26] Kazakhstan scored 31 points out of 100 in Transparency International's 2018 edition of the Corruption Perceptions Index, indicating high levels of corruption.[27]\n\n\nCyril Muller, the World Bank Vice President for Europe and Central Asia, visited Astana in January 2017. He praised the country's progress, made during the 25-year partnership with the World Bank. Muller also talked about Kazakhstan's improved positioning in the World Bank's Doing Business Report 2017, where Kazakhstan ranked 35th out of 190 countries worldwide.[28] After 2000, the government conducted several public sector reforms and adopted the New Public Management (NPM) approach, which was aimed at reducing costs and increasing the efficiency of the public service delivery.[29]\n\n\nKazakhstan secured the 3rd position in the Central and South Asia regional ranking of the 2018 Global Innovation Index (GII) released by World Intellectual Property Organization.[30]\n\n\n\n\n## Macro-economic trend[edit]\n\n\n![](image)GDP per capita development, since 1973\nIn the 2014 Economic Freedom Index published by The Heritage Foundation in Washington, DC, Kazakhstan has gained 22 points over the past 17 years, which is noted by the authors as among the 20 best improvements recorded by any country.[31] Kazakhstan's economic freedom score is 69.1, equalling \"moderately free\". Its overall score has increased by 0.1 point, with significant improvements in investment freedom and government integrity offsetting steep declines in fiscal health and monetary freedom. Kazakhstan is ranked 11th among 43 countries in the Asia–Pacific region, and its overall score is above the regional and world averages.[31]\n\n\nThis chart shows trends in the gross domestic product of Kazakhstan at market prices estimated by the International Monetary Fund, with figures in millions of tenge.[32]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year | Gross Domestic Product (millions ₸) | US$ Exchange Rate | Inflation Index (2000=100) | Per Capita Income (as % of USA)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1995 | 78,014,200 | T 61.11 | 64 | 3.81\n |\n| 2000 | 102,599,902 | T 142.26 | 100 | 3.53\n |\n| 2005 | 147,453,000 | T 132.88 | 140 | 9.01\n |\n| 2017\n | 159,406,930\n | ₸344.18\n |  |  |\n\n\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980–2017.

growth and GDP[edit]\n\n\nKazakhstan's GDP grew 4.1% in real terms during the period from January to September 2011.[34]\n\n\nKazakhstan's real GDP growth was projected to reach 4.3% in 2014, the main driving force of the economy in Kazakhstan in 2014 is the consumer sector; the consumption in Kazakhstan is mainly boosted by the retail lending.[35]\n\n\nAccording to the Agency of Statistics of the Republic of Kazakhstan the country's GDP growth in the first quarter of 2014 was 3.8%.[36]\n\n\nThe country devalued its currency by 19% in February 2014.[37] The country experienced a slowdown in economic growth from 2014 sparked by falling oil prices and the effects of the 2014 Russo-Ukrainian War.[22]\n\n\nThe Government of Kazakhstan signed a Framework Partnership Agreement with IBRD, IFC, MIGA on 1 May 2014; according to this Agreement the World Bank will allocate US$2.5 trillion to Kazakhstan, for the diversification of the economy and reaching the sustainable development.[38]\n\n\nThe World Bank report shows that Kazakhstan, as of 2015, reached the level of an upper-middle-income country with a GDP of US$170 billion.[39]\n\n\nAnother 22% devaluation occurred in August 2015.[40]\n\n\nForeign direct investment increased 30 percent in 2015 in Kazakhstan's agricultural industry and 80 percent in the country's petroleum products sector.[41]\n\n\nIn 2016 Kazakhstan's economy started to recover from the crisis caused by low oil prices and the tenge devaluation. According to the Minister of National Economy of Kazakhstan, in nine months of 2016 the GDP growth reached 0.4%. Sectors of economy that experienced the highest growth included construction (6.9%), agriculture (4.9%), and transport sector (4.0%).[42]\n\n\nThe GDP per capita in current US$ in Kazakhstan declined by about 40% between 2013 compared and 2017.[43]\n\n\nKazakhstan was ranked 25th out of 190 countries in the World Bank's Doing Business 2020 report. The country improved its position by 3 points, from 28 to 25, in the 2020 ranking compared to the previous year. This placed Kazakhstan ahead of countries such as Iceland (26th place), Austria (27th place), Russia (28th place), Japan (29th place), etc.[44]\n\n\nKazakhstan has prioritized the development of non-oil sectors of economy, which accounted for 85% of the country's economic growth in 2019.[45]\n\n\nIn the first seven months of 2020, Kazakhstan exported significantly more goods than the previous year, including a seven-fold increase in automobile exports. The country's GDP decreased by 3 percent due to the decline in the service sector because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but the real sector of the economy grew significantly. Agriculture, construction, and manufacturing all saw increases in production in the first eight months of the year.[46]\n\n\nThe biggest growth in 2020 occurred in the automotive industry (+53.6%), pharmaceuticals (+39.7%), processed metal products (+19.5%), mechanical engineering (+16.5%), as well as in light industry (+16.4%).[47] The industries in the service sector that demonstrated growth included construction (+10.7%) and information and communications (+8.2%).[47]\n\n\n\n## Sectors of economy[edit]\n\n\n### Primary[edit]\n\n\n#### Energy[edit]\n\n\nKazakhstan is the leading country in the world for uranium production volumes with 35% of global production,[48] and it has the world's second biggest uranium reserves after Australia.[49]\n\n\n\n#### Oil and gas[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Energy policy of Kazakhstan\n\nOil and gas is the leading economic sector. In 2000, Kazakhstan produced 35,252,000 metric tons of oil (700,000 barrels per day), a 17.4% increase over 1999's 30,025,000 tons. It exported 28,883,000 tons of oil in 2000, up 38.8% from 20,813,000 tons in 1999. Production in 2001 has been growing at roughly 20%, on target to meet the government's forecast of 40,100,000 tons of oil (800,000 barrels per day). In 2000, production reached 11.5 km³ of natural gas, up from 8.2 km³ in 1999.\n\n\nKazakhstan has the potential to be a world-class oil exporter in the medium term. The landmark foreign investment in Kazakhstan is the TengizChevroil joint venture, owned 50% by ChevronTexaco, 25% by ExxonMobil, 20% by KazMunaiGas of Kazakhstan, and 5% by LukArco of Russia.[50] The Karachaganak natural gas and gas condensate field is being developed by BG, Agip, ChevronTexaco, and Lukoil. The Agip-led Offshore Kazakhstan Consortium has discovered potentially huge Kashagan oil field in the northern Caspian. Kazakhstan's economic future is linked to oil and gas development. GDP growth will depend on the price of oil, as well as the ability to develop new deposits.\n\n\nJanuary 2022 began with thousands of people returning to the streets of Kazakhstan to protest against the surging gas prices, recording four straight days of demonstrations, which is claimed to be the biggest protests to have taken place in the oil-rich country in decades. Protesters invaded into government buildings and took over police vehicles despite a strict emergency led by the state being in place.[51]\n\n\n\n#### Mining[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mining in Kazakhstan\n\nKazakhstan is a leading producer of many mineral commodities, including salt, uranium, ferrochrome, titanium sponge, cadmium, potash, magnesium, rhenium, copper, bauxite, gallium and zinc.[52]\n\n\nThe country was the world's largest producer of uranium in 2018.[53] In 2019, the country was the world's 10th largest producer of gold;[54] 11th largest world producer of copper;[55] 3rd largest worldwide producer of chromium;[56] 9th largest world producer of bauxite;[57] 9th largest world producer of zinc;[58] 10th largest worldwide producer of antimony;[59] 12th largest world producer of iron ore;[60] 12th largest world producer of lead;[61] 14th largest world producer of manganese;[62] 17th largest world producer of phosphate;[63] 6th largest world producer of bismuth,[64] and the 7th largest world producer of sulfur.[65]\n\n\n\n### Industry[edit]\n\n\n#### Motor cars[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2014 the CKD (Complete Knock-Down) assembly of Toyota Fortuner was launched in Kostanay, Kazakhstan.[66] The expected annual output makes around 3,000 cars.[66]\n\n\nThe Kazakhstan's car industry was developing rapidly in 2014 producing US$2 billion worth of products annually.[67] Unfortunately, the industry experienced a decline despite high hopes, with sales dwindling to only 46,000 in 2016.[68]\n\n\nIn 2020, the Kazakh economy observed the biggest growth in its automotive industry, which saw a 53.6% growth, despite the COVID-19 pandemic.[47]\n\n\n\n#### Rail[edit]\n\n\nGE Transportation acquired 50% stake in Lokomotiv Kurastyru Zauyty in a joint venture with Kazakhstan's national railway company Temir Zholy.[69]\n\n\n\n### Services[edit]\n\n\n#### Technology[edit]\n\n\nOn 22 December 2014 the World Bank approved an US$88 million loan that would support Kazakhstan's efforts to facilitate commercially and socially viable innovation in technology.[70] The Fostering Productive Innovation Project aims to improve the country in areas that are able to foster and support technological innovation.[70]\n\n\n\n#### Retail[edit]\n\n\nAccording to A.T. Kearney's 2015 Global Retail Development Index, Kazakhstan ranked 13 out of 30.[71] In the 2016th Index, Kazakhstan ranked as the 4th best developing country for retail investments, scoring 56.5 out of 100.[72] Kazakhstan's market attracted large international retailers, such as French retail chains Carrefour and Leroy Merlin, as well as food giants McDonald's and KFC.[73]\n\n\n\n#### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nThis section is an excerpt from Tourism in Kazakhstan.[edit]\n![](image)View of Mausoleum of Khoja Ahmed Yasawi\n![](image)Number of international tourism arrivals in Kazakhstan\nKazakhstan is the ninth-largest country by area and the largest landlocked country. Tourism is not a major component of the economy. As of 2014, tourism has accounted for 0.3% of Kazakhstan GDP, but the government had plans to increase it to 3% by 2020.[74][75][*needs update*]\n\n\n\nAccording to the World Economic Forum's Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report 2017, travel and tourism industry GDP in Kazakhstan is $3.08 billion or 1.6 percent of total GDP. The WEF ranks Kazakhstan 81st in its 2017 report, which is four positions higher compared to the previous period.[76] Kazakhstan received 6.5 million tourists in 2016.\n\n#### Gambling[edit]\n\n\nGambling in Kazakhstan was developing already during the day of Czarist Russia, then lotteries were organized. In 1698, Czar Peter I signed a decree which allowed organized lotteries for the first time. In later years lotteries were organized by the Ministry of Finance of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, which included Kazakhstan.\n\n\nThe Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Kazakhstan started issuing licenses for gambling activity in 1999.\n\n\nIn 2007 the government of Kazakhstan has introduced a new law which ordered banning gambling on the territory of Kazakhstan besides 2 places which were to become the examples of Russia's special gambling zones. Casinos existing outside these areas had to be closed or moved to places where they could operate legally. The first legal casino opened after the introduction of new law was Casino Flamingo in Kapchagay, which was opened on 1 October 2008.\n\n\nIn 2018, the income of gambling companies in Kazakhstan amounted to ₸19.5 billion. This is 16.1% more than in 2017. Then this amount was at the level of ₸16.8 billion.[77]\n\n\n\n#### Housing market[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2016, the total housing area in Kazakhstan was 342.6 million square metres (3,688 million square feet), an average of 21.4 m2 (230 sq ft) per person.[78] The housing area per person increased by 20% in the period from 2005 to 2016,[78] but remained below the UN's recommended standard of 30 square metres (320 square feet) per person.\n\n\n\n## External trade and investment[edit]\n\n\n### Trade[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kazakh export destinations, 2013\nKazakhstan has 11 transcontinental routes, including rail and road routes, and many oil and gas pipelines. The country's geographic position allows for the transporting of goods from China to Europe three to four times faster than other routes.[79]\n\n\nSherin Suzhikova, Counselor of Kazakhstan's Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Chao Yon-chuan, Secretary-General of the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA), signed an agreement on 13 October 2006 in Taipei to improve economic relations through \"exchanges of market information and visits by trade professionals.\" TAITRA has an office in Almaty, Kazakhstan.[80]\n\n\nIn 2006, North Dakota's then Lieutenant Governor Jack Dalrymple led an 18-member delegation of the North Dakota Trade Office representing seven North Dakota companies and Dickinson State University on a trip to Kazakhstan, Ukraine and Russia. North Dakota exports mostly machinery to Kazakhstan, the eighth largest destination for North Dakotan exports; machinery exports increased from US$22,000 to US$25 million between 2000 and 2005.[81]\n\n\nThe percentage of high-tech exports (as a share of manufactured exports) from Kazakhstan has grown from just 4.46% in 1995 to 37.17% in 2014. One of the main factors that triggered this growth was the Technology Commercialization Project developed and implemented by the World Bank Group and the Kazakh Government. Through this project, 65 Kazakh tech startups received funding and training helping them get their innovations into markets.[82]\n\n\nChina is Kazakhstan's important trade partner. In late March 2015 the two countries signed 33 deals worth US$23.6 billion.[83] The deals cover different industries, such as oil refining, cars, steel.[83]\n\n\nKazakhstan's foreign trade turnover in 2018 comprised $93.5bn that is 19.7% more compared to 2017. The volume of export in the reporting period made $67bn (+25.7%) and import was $32.5bn (+9.9%).[84]\n\n\nThe Government of Kazakhstan has been supporting Kazakhstani exporters operating in foreign markets through their QazTrade incubator. Since September 2019, the program selects businesses and assists them with navigating bureaucracy and connecting to foreign markets the government deems a priority, including Germany, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Iran, and China.[85]\n\n\n\n### National investment strategy[edit]\n\n\nThe Kazakh government approved in August 2017 a national investment strategy, which seeks to increase foreign investments by 26% in five years and create a more favorable investment climate. The strategy also identified 27 countries as the most important sources investments.[86] These countries include the US, UK, China, Russia, Germany, France, Italy, Turkey, Japan, the UAE, South Korea and others. The Ministry for Investment and Development works with Ministry of Foreign Affairs to develop individual plans of actions for each country.[86]\n\n\nIn order to achieve the 26% growth of FDI, Kazakhstan executes economic diplomacy. Key actors of Kazakhstan's foreign economic policy are the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Trade and Integration of Kazakhstan, KazakhInvest and Qaztrade.[87]\n\n\n\n### Bond market[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2014, Kazakhstan introduced its first overseas dollar bonds in 14 years.[88] Kazakhstan issued $2.5 billion of 10- and 30-year bonds on 5 October 2014, in what was the nation's first dollar-denominated overseas sale since 2000.[88] Kazakhstan sold $1.5 billion of 10-year dollar bonds to yield 1.5 percentage points above midswaps and $1 billion of 30-year debt at two percentage points over midswaps.[88] The country drew bids for $11 billion.[88]\n\n\n\n### Foreign direct investment[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **may contain an excessive amount of intricate detail that may interest only a particular audience**. Please help by spinning off or relocating any relevant information, and removing excessive detail that may be against Wikipedia's inclusion policy. *(July 2023)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*\n |\n\n\nKazakhstan is the largest recipient of total and annual foreign direct investment of all CIS countries.\nThe OECD has recognized the strides the government has made in opening the country to international investment and in improving the policy framework for investment as part of their efforts to diversify the economy.[89] In 2017 Kazakhstan was invited by OECD to become Adherent to the OECD Declaration on International Investment and Multinational Enterprises.[90]\n\n\nIn June 2014 Kazakhstan's president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, signed into law tax concessions to promote foreign investment, including a 10-year exemption from corporation tax, an 8-year exemption from property tax, and a 10-year freeze on most other taxes.[91] Other measures include a refund on capital investments of up to 30 percent once a production facility is in operation.[91] In order to attract investment, Kazakhstan lowered the tax burden for foreign investors. The corporate income tax rate dropped from 30% to 20%. The government also gradually reduced VAT from 16% in 2006 to 12% in 2009.[92]\n\n\nAs of 30 September 2014, total foreign investment in Kazakhstan reached US$211.5 billion. Of that total, net foreign Direct Investment constituted US$129.3 billion, with portfolio and other investments comprising the remaining US$82.2 billion.[92]\n\n\nReflecting Kazakhstan's ambitious FDI roadmap, a three-year goal to increase FDI by US$30 billion by 2025 was announced.[93]\n\n\nAs of July 2015, Kazakhstan attracted US$16 billion in the manufacturing industry over the past five years, which is 2.5 times more than over the previous five years.[94] Kazakhstan put into operation four hundred new products, such as car industry, railway engineering, manufacture of basic chemical products, uranium industry, the industry of rare earth metals.[94] The volume of new enterprises amounted to ₸580 billion.[94]\n\n\nIn June 2015 – June 2016 the total number of enterprises owned by foreign investors in Kazakhstan increased by 2.3 percent and reached 9,000. 8,691 foreign companies operating in the Kazakhstan are small businesses.[95]\n\n\nAs of the beginning of 2016, the World Bank invested over US$6.8 billion in Kazakhstan since 1992. These funds were invested in development of roads and social infrastructure, increasing of competitiveness of SME's, education, healthcare, environment protection, etc.[96]\n\n\nIn 2012, Kazakhstan conducted the first review of the OECD investment standards, which resulted in 12 recommendations on how to improve the investment climate of the country. After adopting Law on public – private partnership that extends the use of the mechanism and revising standards of intellectual property protection and the rules of attracting foreign labor, Kazakhstan started a second review of the OECD in 2016.[97]\n\n\nAccording to Ministry of Investment and Development of Kazakhstan, as of May 2016, attraction of foreign investment in oil refining increased by 80%, food industry – 30%, in engineering – by 7 times. The Ministry also reported that there were 200 investment projects in country worth more than $40 billion.[98]\n\n\nIn mid-2016 a group of companies led by Chevron announced a US$36.8 billion investment in Kazakhstan's Tengiz oil field.[99]\n\n\nIn the first quarter of 2016, Kazakhstan attracted US$2.7 billion in foreign direct investment. The largest investor in the Kazakh economy is the Netherlands ($66 billion), followed by the United States (US$26 billion) and Switzerland (US$15 billion).[100] According to the Chairman of Kazakhstan National Bank, a key factor triggering the increased inflow of foreign investment is implementation of the Nurly Zhol state programme that provides for the creation of favourable conditions. As of September 2016, foreign investments in the Kazakh economy totalled US$5.7 billion, which is 4,8% more than during the same period of the previous year.[101]\n\n\nSummarizing 2016, Kazakhstan's Foreign Minister Erlan Idrissov noted that Kazakhstan attracted US$20 billion of foreign direct investment during the year.[102] The gross inflow of foreign direct investment in 2016 grew by 40% compared to 2015 and surpassed the previous record of 2008. The number of foreign businesses operating in Kazakhstan increased 25% in 2016 compared to 2015.[103] The main recipients of foreign direct investment were the mining industry, geological exploration and processing. The top four investors include the Netherlands, the United States, Switzerland and France.[104]\n\n\nKazakhstan introduced a visa-free regime for citizens of EAEU, OECD, Monaco, Malaysia, United Arab Emirates, and Singapore starting from 2017. The visa-free entry is expected to increase cooperation with investors and businesses of these countries.[105]\n\n\nAgriculture is one of Kazakhstan's most important sectors where the country seeks to attract foreign investments to boost the competitiveness of this sector of economy. To that end, in 2017 KazAgro negotiated with the European Investment Bank (EIB) a €200 million loan for a period of 15 years.[106]\n\n\nKazakhstan attracted $330 billion in foreign direct investment from more than 120 countries since 1991 until 2019. More than 50% of FDI in Kazakhstan was directed from the European Union (EU). 15%, or $48.4 billion, of FDI originated from the United States, and 5% from the United Kingdom and China each. President Tokayev set foreign investment attraction as a priority in his 2 September 2019 state-of-the-nation address.[107] In 2018, Kazakhstan attracted $24 billion of foreign direct investments. The Foreign Ministry of Kazakhstan plays an important role in attracting foreign investors to the country.[108]\n\n\nIn 2019, gross FDI inflow to Kazakhstan amounted to US$24.1 billion. In 2019, mining and metallurgy accounted for the largest volume of foreign investment – 56.3%. The industry attracted record US$13.586 billion in foreign investment. Manufacturing and trade were second and third most attractive sectors for investors. US$3.5 billion of FDI was directed into the manufacturing industry, while trade attracted $3 billion in 2019.[109]\n\n\nThe top five countries investing the most into the economy of Kazakhstan remained unchanged in 2019. The Netherlands invested $7.3 billion in Kazakhstan (30.2%), followed by the USA — $5.5 billion (23.0%) and Switzerland — $2.2 billion. China outran the Russian Federation in terms of investments and took 4th place with $1.7 billion (7.0%), while the Russian Federation closed the top five with $1.4 billion (5.8%) invested in Kazakhstan.[110]\n\n\nNoteworthy that Kazakhstan's gross inflow of FDI increased 15.8 percent per year in 2018 and remained at the level of US$24 billion from 2019, even though world economies saw a decrease in investment during that time period.[111]\n\n\n13 Kazakhstan's regions out of 14 saw investment growth in 2020, despite the COVID-19 pandemic. High growth of investment was in the construction sector, specifically in Turkestan region and Zhambyl region as well as Shymkent city.[112]\n\n\n\n### Investor support[edit]\n\n\nKazakhstan's investment environment is defined by the government's support for foreign investors. To increase the FDI inflow, the country established the Kazakh Invest National Company, or Kazakh Invest for short. It is a one-stop shop for investors that facilitates investment projects' implementation process from an idea to implementation, as well as ensures aftercare services. In 2018, Kazakh Invest helped develop more than 70 investment proposals in a variety of industries: metallurgy, petrochemistry, food industry, tourism and other. It included creating a business plan, financial model and teaser development.[113]\n\n\nIn order to facilitate foreign investment, Kazakhstan launched in 2020 an online portal elicense.kz, which allows to conclude investment contracts online reducing red tape.[114] The first agreement that was concluded via the portal was between Kaz Solar 50 and the German company Solarnet Investment GmbH for a renewable energy project worth ₸5 billion.[114]\n\n\n\n### Intellectual property[edit]\n\n\nIn 2015 Kazakhstan passed a law to regulate Intellectual Property, patent law, and copyright protections and bring its legislation into line with the European Patent Convention (1994 revision) and the 2006 Singapore Treaty.[115]\n\n\n\n## Public policy[edit]\n\n\n### 2015 \"Nurly Zhol\" economic policy[edit]\n\n\nOn 11 November 2014 in his address to the nation for 2015, Nazarbayev proclaimed Kazakhstan's New Economic Policy – The Path to the Future (Nurly Zhol).[116] The new economic policy implies large-scale state investment in infrastructure over the next several years.[117] In the short term, the program \"Nurly Zhol\" will apply the anti-crisis measures to overcome the turbulence in the global economy.[118] The long-term measures of the state program of infrastructure development will help to create a strong platform for new growth.[118]\n\n\nKazakhstan has identified five priorities for modernization of the state and the economy to maintain competitiveness in the Fourth Industrial Revolution.[119]\n\n\nKazakhstan was ranked 36th in the Ease of Doing Business report released by the World Bank Group in 2018. The report's rankings rate ease of regulations for businesses and strength of property rights.\n\n\nThe Heritage Foundation, a Washington DC – based research center, ranked Kazakhstan 41st in its Index of Economic Freedom 2018. Its overall score has increased by 0.1 point, still being only \"moderately free\" with significant improvements in investment freedom and government integrity offsetting steep declines in fiscal health and monetary freedom.[120]\n\n\nKazakhstan aimed in 2017 to boost its economy by attracting private investors interested in developing national companies. This is the main goal of privatization that is expected to decrease the share of public property to 15% of GDP. Such companies as Kazakhstan Railways, Samruk-Energo, Kazatomprom, Kaspost, KazMunayGas and Air Astana are expected to be sold through IPO.[121]\n\n\nKazakhstan fell from 32nd to the 38th place in the 2018 IMD World Competitiveness ranking. The report evaluates business efficiency, public finance and domestic economy.[122]\n\n\n\n### Privatisation 2016–2020[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2015, Kazakhstan Government approved new privatization plan for 2016 – 2020.[123] It is a large-scale privatization program that continues the privatization of 2014 and includes 60 major state-owned companies.[124] According to Kazakh Finance ministry, the state budget got ₸6.99 billion (US$20.6 million) from the deals reached within the 2014–2016 privatization program as of 20 Sept. 2016. Kazakhstan's privatization program aims to reduce the state participation in the economy to 15 percent, which is the level set for countries of the OECD.[125]\n\n\n\n### Special Economic Zones[edit]\n\n\nA Special Economic Zone (SEZ) is a part of Kazakhstan's territory, which has a special legal regime, with all the necessary infrastructure, to carry out priority activities.[126]\n\n\nOn the territory of the Republic of Kazakhstan, there are 12 special economic zones with different sectoral orientations:\n\n\n\n1. SEZ \"Astana – New City\"\n2. SEZ \"Saryarka\"\n3. SEZ \"National Industrial Petrochemical Technopark\"\n4. SEZ \"Seaport Aktau\"\n5. SEZ \"Ontustik\"\n6. SEZ \"Chemical Park Taraz\"\n7. SEZ \"Khorgos – East Gate\"\n8. SEZ \"Park of Innovative Technologies\"\n9. SEZ \"Pavlodar\"\n10. SEZ \"Astana – Technopolis\"\n11. SEZ \"Turkistan\"\n12. SEZ \"ICBC\" Khorgos\"[127]\n\n\n### Small and medium-sized enterprises[edit]\n\n\nA new program to support small businesses was launched in Kazakhstan in February 2015.[128] 2015 is expected to be a pilot period of the program.[128] During that period the initiative will be focused on three major areas, notably agribusiness, machinery building and production of construction materials, and is to be further extended to other industries.[128]\n\n\nIn May 2015 the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) agreed to provide €41 million for technical cooperation projects, advisory support to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and to introduce a Women in Business program.[129]\n\n\nIn 2016 the number of Kazakhstan's telecom start-ups increased by 10% compared to 2015. Around 9,400 small telecom companies are currently registered in the country.[130]\n\n\nThe Kazakh Government provides extensive support to businesses, especially SMEs. The development of SMEs is an integral part of Kazakhstan's *Business Road Map 2020* state programme. The share of SMEs in Kazakhstan's GDP increased from 24.9% in 2015 to 28.4% in 2018. Kazakhstan plans to raise this indicator to 50% by 2050.[131]\n\n\n\n## Recent miscellany[edit]\n\n\nKazakhstan was ranked 54th 2017 Economic Freedom of the World report published by Fraser Institute, but ranks 12 places below on place 66 when adjusted by the Gender Disparity Index, which captures the degree to which women around the world have the same legal rights as men and adjusts the economic freedom score accordingly. This shows a large disadvantage of women in business.[132]\n\n\nIn recent years a trade route has been established between Kazakhstan and the United States. It now makes up 54% of the World's salt imports and exports by volume (350,000 tonnes per year).[133][*clarification needed*]\n\n\nIn 2021, 14 products developed by Kazakh scientists began being exported to China, Russia, Turkey, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, and the Czech Republic. These products include, but are not limited to, food & drinks based on milk whey; probiotics; an anti-fungal drug; biological sanitation products.[134]\n\n\nIn 2021, it was reported that the number of young female entrepreneurs in Kazakhstan has increased by 15 percent.[135]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* KazKuat (2005), state-owned organization for domestic hydro-electric sector\n* Yerbolat Dosayev, Minister of National Economy\n* Vladimir Shkolnik, Minister of Energy\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"World Economic Outlook Database, April 2019\". *IMF.org*.

In 2021, Kazakhstan attracted more than US$370 billion of foreign investments since becoming an independent republic after the collapse of the former Soviet Union.[18]\n\n\nIt possesses oil reserves as well as minerals and metals. It also has considerable agricultural potential, with its vast steppe lands accommodating both livestock and grain production. The mountains in the south are important for apples and walnuts; both species grow wild there. Kazakhstan's industrial sector rests on the extraction and processing of these natural resources.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe Dissolution of the Soviet Union and the collapse of demand for Kazakhstan's traditional heavy industry products have resulted in a sharp decline of the economy since 1991, with the steepest annual decline occurring in 1994. In 1995–97 the pace of the government program of economic reform and privatization quickened, resulting in a substantial shifting of assets into the private sector. Kazakhstan was granted \"market economy country\" status by the European Union and the United States, in 2000 and 2002 respectively.[19]\n\n\nThe December 1996 signing of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium agreement to build a new pipeline from western Kazakhstan's Tengiz Field through Russia to the Black Sea increased prospects for substantially larger oil exports until Putin took issue with the lukewarm support he experienced in the wake of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine from Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. Kazakhstan's economy turned downward in 1998 with a 2.5% decline in GDP growth due to slumping oil prices and the August financial crisis in Russia. A bright spot in 1999 was the recovery of international petroleum prices, which, combined with a well-timed tenge devaluation and a bumper grain harvest, pulled the economy out of recession.\n\n\nGDP per capita shrank by 26% in the 1990s.[20] In the 2000s, Kazakhstan's economy grew sharply, aided by increased prices on world markets for Kazakhstan's leading exports: oil, metals and grain. GDP grew 9.6% in 2000, up from 1.7% in 1999. In 2006, extremely high GDP growth had been sustained, and grew by 10.6%.[21] Business with the booming economies of Russia and China, as well as neighboring Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) nations have helped to propel this growth. The increased economic growth also led to a turn-around in government finances, with the budget moving from a cash deficit of 3.7% of GDP in 1999 to 0.1% surplus in 2000. The country experienced a slowdown in economic growth from 2014, sparked by falling oil prices and the effects of the Russo-Ukrainian War.[22] The country's currency was devalued by 19% in 2014 and by 22% in 2015.\n\n\nIn 2017, the World Economic Forum compiled its Global Competitiveness Ranking, ranking Kazakhstan 57th out of 144 countries.[23] The ranking considers multiple macroeconomic and financial factors, such as market size, GDP, tax rates, infrastructure development, etc.[24] In 2012, the World Economic Forum listed corruption as the biggest problem in doing business in the country,[25] while the World Bank listed Kazakhstan as a corruption hotspot, on a par with Angola, Bolivia, Kenya, Libya and Pakistan.[26] Kazakhstan scored 31 points out of 100 in Transparency International's 2018 edition of the Corruption Perceptions Index, indicating high levels of corruption.[27]\n\n\nCyril Muller, the World Bank Vice President for Europe and Central Asia, visited Astana in January 2017. He praised the country's progress, made during the 25-year partnership with the World Bank. Muller also talked about Kazakhstan's improved positioning in the World Bank's Doing Business Report 2017, where Kazakhstan ranked 35th out of 190 countries worldwide.[28] After 2000, the government conducted several public sector reforms and adopted the New Public Management (NPM) approach, which was aimed at reducing costs and increasing the efficiency of the public service delivery.[29]\n\n\nKazakhstan secured the 3rd position in the Central and South Asia regional ranking of the 2018 Global Innovation Index (GII) released by World Intellectual Property Organization.[30]\n\n\n\n\n## Macro-economic trend[edit]\n\n\n![](image)GDP per capita development, since 1973\nIn the 2014 Economic Freedom Index published by The Heritage Foundation in Washington, DC, Kazakhstan has gained 22 points over the past 17 years, which is noted by the authors as among the 20 best improvements recorded by any country.[31] Kazakhstan's economic freedom score is 69.1, equalling \"moderately free\". Its overall score has increased by 0.1 point, with significant improvements in investment freedom and government integrity offsetting steep declines in fiscal health and monetary freedom. Kazakhstan is ranked 11th among 43 countries in the Asia–Pacific region, and its overall score is above the regional and world averages.[31]\n\n\nThis chart shows trends in the gross domestic product of Kazakhstan at market prices estimated by the International Monetary Fund, with figures in millions of tenge.[32]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year | Gross Domestic Product (millions ₸) | US$ Exchange Rate | Inflation Index (2000=100) | Per Capita Income (as % of USA)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1995 | 78,014,200 | T 61.11 | 64 | 3.81\n |\n| 2000 | 102,599,902 | T 142.26 | 100 | 3.53\n |\n| 2005 | 147,453,000 | T 132.88 | 140 | 9.01\n |\n| 2017\n | 159,406,930\n | ₸344.18\n |  |  |\n\n\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980–2017.

growth and GDP[edit]\n\n\nKazakhstan's GDP grew 4.1% in real terms during the period from January to September 2011.[34]\n\n\nKazakhstan's real GDP growth was projected to reach 4.3% in 2014, the main driving force of the economy in Kazakhstan in 2014 is the consumer sector; the consumption in Kazakhstan is mainly boosted by the retail lending.[35]\n\n\nAccording to the Agency of Statistics of the Republic of Kazakhstan the country's GDP growth in the first quarter of 2014 was 3.8%.[36]\n\n\nThe country devalued its currency by 19% in February 2014.[37] The country experienced a slowdown in economic growth from 2014 sparked by falling oil prices and the effects of the 2014 Russo-Ukrainian War.[22]\n\n\nThe Government of Kazakhstan signed a Framework Partnership Agreement with IBRD, IFC, MIGA on 1 May 2014; according to this Agreement the World Bank will allocate US$2.5 trillion to Kazakhstan, for the diversification of the economy and reaching the sustainable development.[38]\n\n\nThe World Bank report shows that Kazakhstan, as of 2015, reached the level of an upper-middle-income country with a GDP of US$170 billion.[39]\n\n\nAnother 22% devaluation occurred in August 2015.[40]\n\n\nForeign direct investment increased 30 percent in 2015 in Kazakhstan's agricultural industry and 80 percent in the country's petroleum products sector.[41]\n\n\nIn 2016 Kazakhstan's economy started to recover from the crisis caused by low oil prices and the tenge devaluation. According to the Minister of National Economy of Kazakhstan, in nine months of 2016 the GDP growth reached 0.4%. Sectors of economy that experienced the highest growth included construction (6.9%), agriculture (4.9%), and transport sector (4.0%).[42]\n\n\nThe GDP per capita in current US$ in Kazakhstan declined by about 40% between 2013 compared and 2017.[43]\n\n\nKazakhstan was ranked 25th out of 190 countries in the World Bank's Doing Business 2020 report. The country improved its position by 3 points, from 28 to 25, in the 2020 ranking compared to the previous year. This placed Kazakhstan ahead of countries such as Iceland (26th place), Austria (27th place), Russia (28th place), Japan (29th place), etc.[44]\n\n\nKazakhstan has prioritized the development of non-oil sectors of economy, which accounted for 85% of the country's economic growth in 2019.[45]\n\n\nIn the first seven months of 2020, Kazakhstan exported significantly more goods than the previous year, including a seven-fold increase in automobile exports. The country's GDP decreased by 3 percent due to the decline in the service sector because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but the real sector of the economy grew significantly. Agriculture, construction, and manufacturing all saw increases in production in the first eight months of the year.[46]\n\n\nThe biggest growth in 2020 occurred in the automotive industry (+53.6%), pharmaceuticals (+39.7%), processed metal products (+19.5%), mechanical engineering (+16.5%), as well as in light industry (+16.4%).[47] The industries in the service sector that demonstrated growth included construction (+10.7%) and information and communications (+8.2%).[47]\n\n\n\n## Sectors of economy[edit]\n\n\n### Primary[edit]\n\n\n#### Energy[edit]\n\n\nKazakhstan is the leading country in the world for uranium production volumes with 35% of global production,[48] and it has the world's second biggest uranium reserves after Australia.[49]\n\n\n\n#### Oil and gas[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Energy policy of Kazakhstan\n\nOil and gas is the leading economic sector. In 2000, Kazakhstan produced 35,252,000 metric tons of oil (700,000 barrels per day), a 17.4% increase over 1999's 30,025,000 tons. It exported 28,883,000 tons of oil in 2000, up 38.8% from 20,813,000 tons in 1999. Production in 2001 has been growing at roughly 20%, on target to meet the government's forecast of 40,100,000 tons of oil (800,000 barrels per day). In 2000, production reached 11.5 km³ of natural gas, up from 8.2 km³ in 1999.\n\n\nKazakhstan has the potential to be a world-class oil exporter in the medium term. The landmark foreign investment in Kazakhstan is the TengizChevroil joint venture, owned 50% by ChevronTexaco, 25% by ExxonMobil, 20% by KazMunaiGas of Kazakhstan, and 5% by LukArco of Russia.[50] The Karachaganak natural gas and gas condensate field is being developed by BG, Agip, ChevronTexaco, and Lukoil. The Agip-led Offshore Kazakhstan Consortium has discovered potentially huge Kashagan oil field in the northern Caspian. Kazakhstan's economic future is linked to oil and gas development. GDP growth will depend on the price of oil, as well as the ability to develop new deposits.\n\n\nJanuary 2022 began with thousands of people returning to the streets of Kazakhstan to protest against the surging gas prices, recording four straight days of demonstrations, which is claimed to be the biggest protests to have taken place in the oil-rich country in decades. Protesters invaded into government buildings and took over police vehicles despite a strict emergency led by the state being in place.[51]\n\n\n\n#### Mining[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mining in Kazakhstan\n\nKazakhstan is a leading producer of many mineral commodities, including salt, uranium, ferrochrome, titanium sponge, cadmium, potash, magnesium, rhenium, copper, bauxite, gallium and zinc.[52]\n\n\nThe country was the world's largest producer of uranium in 2018.[53] In 2019, the country was the world's 10th largest producer of gold;[54] 11th largest world producer of copper;[55] 3rd largest worldwide producer of chromium;[56] 9th largest world producer of bauxite;[57] 9th largest world producer of zinc;[58] 10th largest worldwide producer of antimony;[59] 12th largest world producer of iron ore;[60] 12th largest world producer of lead;[61] 14th largest world producer of manganese;[62] 17th largest world producer of phosphate;[63] 6th largest world producer of bismuth,[64] and the 7th largest world producer of sulfur.[65]\n\n\n\n### Industry[edit]\n\n\n#### Motor cars[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2014 the CKD (Complete Knock-Down) assembly of Toyota Fortuner was launched in Kostanay, Kazakhstan.[66] The expected annual output makes around 3,000 cars.[66]\n\n\nThe Kazakhstan's car industry was developing rapidly in 2014 producing US$2 billion worth of products annually.[67] Unfortunately, the industry experienced a decline despite high hopes, with sales dwindling to only 46,000 in 2016.[68]\n\n\nIn 2020, the Kazakh economy observed the biggest growth in its automotive industry, which saw a 53.6% growth, despite the COVID-19 pandemic.[47]\n\n\n\n#### Rail[edit]\n\n\nGE Transportation acquired 50% stake in Lokomotiv Kurastyru Zauyty in a joint venture with Kazakhstan's national railway company Temir Zholy.[69]\n\n\n\n### Services[edit]\n\n\n#### Technology[edit]\n\n\nOn 22 December 2014 the World Bank approved an US$88 million loan that would support Kazakhstan's efforts to facilitate commercially and socially viable innovation in technology.[70] The Fostering Productive Innovation Project aims to improve the country in areas that are able to foster and support technological innovation.[70]\n\n\n\n#### Retail[edit]\n\n\nAccording to A.T. Kearney's 2015 Global Retail Development Index, Kazakhstan ranked 13 out of 30.[71] In the 2016th Index, Kazakhstan ranked as the 4th best developing country for retail investments, scoring 56.5 out of 100.[72] Kazakhstan's market attracted large international retailers, such as French retail chains Carrefour and Leroy Merlin, as well as food giants McDonald's and KFC.[73]\n\n\n\n#### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nThis section is an excerpt from Tourism in Kazakhstan.[edit]\n![](image)View of Mausoleum of Khoja Ahmed Yasawi\n![](image)Number of international tourism arrivals in Kazakhstan\nKazakhstan is the ninth-largest country by area and the largest landlocked country. Tourism is not a major component of the economy. As of 2014, tourism has accounted for 0.3% of Kazakhstan GDP, but the government had plans to increase it to 3% by 2020.[74][75][*needs update*]\n\n\n\nAccording to the World Economic Forum's Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report 2017, travel and tourism industry GDP in Kazakhstan is $3.08 billion or 1.6 percent of total GDP. The WEF ranks Kazakhstan 81st in its 2017 report, which is four positions higher compared to the previous period.[76] Kazakhstan received 6.5 million tourists in 2016.\n\n#### Gambling[edit]\n\n\nGambling in Kazakhstan was developing already during the day of Czarist Russia, then lotteries were organized. In 1698, Czar Peter I signed a decree which allowed organized lotteries for the first time. In later years lotteries were organized by the Ministry of Finance of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, which included Kazakhstan.\n\n\nThe Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Kazakhstan started issuing licenses for gambling activity in 1999.\n\n\nIn 2007 the government of Kazakhstan has introduced a new law which ordered banning gambling on the territory of Kazakhstan besides 2 places which were to become the examples of Russia's special gambling zones. Casinos existing outside these areas had to be closed or moved to places where they could operate legally. The first legal casino opened after the introduction of new law was Casino Flamingo in Kapchagay, which was opened on 1 October 2008.\n\n\nIn 2018, the income of gambling companies in Kazakhstan amounted to ₸19.5 billion. This is 16.1% more than in 2017. Then this amount was at the level of ₸16.8 billion.[77]\n\n\n\n#### Housing market[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2016, the total housing area in Kazakhstan was 342.6 million square metres (3,688 million square feet), an average of 21.4 m2 (230 sq ft) per person.[78] The housing area per person increased by 20% in the period from 2005 to 2016,[78] but remained below the UN's recommended standard of 30 square metres (320 square feet) per person.\n\n\n\n## External trade and investment[edit]\n\n\n### Trade[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kazakh export destinations, 2013\nKazakhstan has 11 transcontinental routes, including rail and road routes, and many oil and gas pipelines. The country's geographic position allows for the transporting of goods from China to Europe three to four times faster than other routes.[79]\n\n\nSherin Suzhikova, Counselor of Kazakhstan's Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Chao Yon-chuan, Secretary-General of the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA), signed an agreement on 13 October 2006 in Taipei to improve economic relations through \"exchanges of market information and visits by trade professionals.\" TAITRA has an office in Almaty, Kazakhstan.[80]\n\n\nIn 2006, North Dakota's then Lieutenant Governor Jack Dalrymple led an 18-member delegation of the North Dakota Trade Office representing seven North Dakota companies and Dickinson State University on a trip to Kazakhstan, Ukraine and Russia. North Dakota exports mostly machinery to Kazakhstan, the eighth largest destination for North Dakotan exports; machinery exports increased from US$22,000 to US$25 million between 2000 and 2005.[81]\n\n\nThe percentage of high-tech exports (as a share of manufactured exports) from Kazakhstan has grown from just 4.46% in 1995 to 37.17% in 2014. One of the main factors that triggered this growth was the Technology Commercialization Project developed and implemented by the World Bank Group and the Kazakh Government. Through this project, 65 Kazakh tech startups received funding and training helping them get their innovations into markets.[82]\n\n\nChina is Kazakhstan's important trade partner. In late March 2015 the two countries signed 33 deals worth US$23.6 billion.[83] The deals cover different industries, such as oil refining, cars, steel.[83]\n\n\nKazakhstan's foreign trade turnover in 2018 comprised $93.5bn that is 19.7% more compared to 2017. The volume of export in the reporting period made $67bn (+25.7%) and import was $32.5bn (+9.9%).[84]\n\n\nThe Government of Kazakhstan has been supporting Kazakhstani exporters operating in foreign markets through their QazTrade incubator. Since September 2019, the program selects businesses and assists them with navigating bureaucracy and connecting to foreign markets the government deems a priority, including Germany, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Iran, and China.[85]\n\n\n\n### National investment strategy[edit]\n\n\nThe Kazakh government approved in August 2017 a national investment strategy, which seeks to increase foreign investments by 26% in five years and create a more favorable investment climate. The strategy also identified 27 countries as the most important sources investments.[86] These countries include the US, UK, China, Russia, Germany, France, Italy, Turkey, Japan, the UAE, South Korea and others. The Ministry for Investment and Development works with Ministry of Foreign Affairs to develop individual plans of actions for each country.[86]\n\n\nIn order to achieve the 26% growth of FDI, Kazakhstan executes economic diplomacy. Key actors of Kazakhstan's foreign economic policy are the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Trade and Integration of Kazakhstan, KazakhInvest and Qaztrade.[87]\n\n\n\n### Bond market[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2014, Kazakhstan introduced its first overseas dollar bonds in 14 years.[88] Kazakhstan issued $2.5 billion of 10- and 30-year bonds on 5 October 2014, in what was the nation's first dollar-denominated overseas sale since 2000.[88] Kazakhstan sold $1.5 billion of 10-year dollar bonds to yield 1.5 percentage points above midswaps and $1 billion of 30-year debt at two percentage points over midswaps.[88] The country drew bids for $11 billion.[88]\n\n\n\n### Foreign direct investment[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **may contain an excessive amount of intricate detail that may interest only a particular audience**.

The corporate income tax rate dropped from 30% to 20%. The government also gradually reduced VAT from 16% in 2006 to 12% in 2009.[92]\n\n\nAs of 30 September 2014, total foreign investment in Kazakhstan reached US$211.5 billion. Of that total, net foreign Direct Investment constituted US$129.3 billion, with portfolio and other investments comprising the remaining US$82.2 billion.[92]\n\n\nReflecting Kazakhstan's ambitious FDI roadmap, a three-year goal to increase FDI by US$30 billion by 2025 was announced.[93]\n\n\nAs of July 2015, Kazakhstan attracted US$16 billion in the manufacturing industry over the past five years, which is 2.5 times more than over the previous five years.[94] Kazakhstan put into operation four hundred new products, such as car industry, railway engineering, manufacture of basic chemical products, uranium industry, the industry of rare earth metals.[94] The volume of new enterprises amounted to ₸580 billion.[94]\n\n\nIn June 2015 – June 2016 the total number of enterprises owned by foreign investors in Kazakhstan increased by 2.3 percent and reached 9,000. 8,691 foreign companies operating in the Kazakhstan are small businesses.[95]\n\n\nAs of the beginning of 2016, the World Bank invested over US$6.8 billion in Kazakhstan since 1992. These funds were invested in development of roads and social infrastructure, increasing of competitiveness of SME's, education, healthcare, environment protection, etc.[96]\n\n\nIn 2012, Kazakhstan conducted the first review of the OECD investment standards, which resulted in 12 recommendations on how to improve the investment climate of the country. After adopting Law on public – private partnership that extends the use of the mechanism and revising standards of intellectual property protection and the rules of attracting foreign labor, Kazakhstan started a second review of the OECD in 2016.[97]\n\n\nAccording to Ministry of Investment and Development of Kazakhstan, as of May 2016, attraction of foreign investment in oil refining increased by 80%, food industry – 30%, in engineering – by 7 times. The Ministry also reported that there were 200 investment projects in country worth more than $40 billion.[98]\n\n\nIn mid-2016 a group of companies led by Chevron announced a US$36.8 billion investment in Kazakhstan's Tengiz oil field.[99]\n\n\nIn the first quarter of 2016, Kazakhstan attracted US$2.7 billion in foreign direct investment. The largest investor in the Kazakh economy is the Netherlands ($66 billion), followed by the United States (US$26 billion) and Switzerland (US$15 billion).[100] According to the Chairman of Kazakhstan National Bank, a key factor triggering the increased inflow of foreign investment is implementation of the Nurly Zhol state programme that provides for the creation of favourable conditions. As of September 2016, foreign investments in the Kazakh economy totalled US$5.7 billion, which is 4,8% more than during the same period of the previous year.[101]\n\n\nSummarizing 2016, Kazakhstan's Foreign Minister Erlan Idrissov noted that Kazakhstan attracted US$20 billion of foreign direct investment during the year.[102] The gross inflow of foreign direct investment in 2016 grew by 40% compared to 2015 and surpassed the previous record of 2008. The number of foreign businesses operating in Kazakhstan increased 25% in 2016 compared to 2015.[103] The main recipients of foreign direct investment were the mining industry, geological exploration and processing. The top four investors include the Netherlands, the United States, Switzerland and France.[104]\n\n\nKazakhstan introduced a visa-free regime for citizens of EAEU, OECD, Monaco, Malaysia, United Arab Emirates, and Singapore starting from 2017. The visa-free entry is expected to increase cooperation with investors and businesses of these countries.[105]\n\n\nAgriculture is one of Kazakhstan's most important sectors where the country seeks to attract foreign investments to boost the competitiveness of this sector of economy. To that end, in 2017 KazAgro negotiated with the European Investment Bank (EIB) a €200 million loan for a period of 15 years.[106]\n\n\nKazakhstan attracted $330 billion in foreign direct investment from more than 120 countries since 1991 until 2019. More than 50% of FDI in Kazakhstan was directed from the European Union (EU). 15%, or $48.4 billion, of FDI originated from the United States, and 5% from the United Kingdom and China each. President Tokayev set foreign investment attraction as a priority in his 2 September 2019 state-of-the-nation address.[107] In 2018, Kazakhstan attracted $24 billion of foreign direct investments. The Foreign Ministry of Kazakhstan plays an important role in attracting foreign investors to the country.[108]\n\n\nIn 2019, gross FDI inflow to Kazakhstan amounted to US$24.1 billion. In 2019, mining and metallurgy accounted for the largest volume of foreign investment – 56.3%. The industry attracted record US$13.586 billion in foreign investment. Manufacturing and trade were second and third most attractive sectors for investors. US$3.5 billion of FDI was directed into the manufacturing industry, while trade attracted $3 billion in 2019.[109]\n\n\nThe top five countries investing the most into the economy of Kazakhstan remained unchanged in 2019. The Netherlands invested $7.3 billion in Kazakhstan (30.2%), followed by the USA — $5.5 billion (23.0%) and Switzerland — $2.2 billion. China outran the Russian Federation in terms of investments and took 4th place with $1.7 billion (7.0%), while the Russian Federation closed the top five with $1.4 billion (5.8%) invested in Kazakhstan.[110]\n\n\nNoteworthy that Kazakhstan's gross inflow of FDI increased 15.8 percent per year in 2018 and remained at the level of US$24 billion from 2019, even though world economies saw a decrease in investment during that time period.[111]\n\n\n13 Kazakhstan's regions out of 14 saw investment growth in 2020, despite the COVID-19 pandemic. High growth of investment was in the construction sector, specifically in Turkestan region and Zhambyl region as well as Shymkent city.[112]\n\n\n\n### Investor support[edit]\n\n\nKazakhstan's investment environment is defined by the government's support for foreign investors. To increase the FDI inflow, the country established the Kazakh Invest National Company, or Kazakh Invest for short. It is a one-stop shop for investors that facilitates investment projects' implementation process from an idea to implementation, as well as ensures aftercare services. In 2018, Kazakh Invest helped develop more than 70 investment proposals in a variety of industries: metallurgy, petrochemistry, food industry, tourism and other. It included creating a business plan, financial model and teaser development.[113]\n\n\nIn order to facilitate foreign investment, Kazakhstan launched in 2020 an online portal elicense.kz, which allows to conclude investment contracts online reducing red tape.[114] The first agreement that was concluded via the portal was between Kaz Solar 50 and the German company Solarnet Investment GmbH for a renewable energy project worth ₸5 billion.[114]\n\n\n\n### Intellectual property[edit]\n\n\nIn 2015 Kazakhstan passed a law to regulate Intellectual Property, patent law, and copyright protections and bring its legislation into line with the European Patent Convention (1994 revision) and the 2006 Singapore Treaty.[115]\n\n\n\n## Public policy[edit]\n\n\n### 2015 \"Nurly Zhol\" economic policy[edit]\n\n\nOn 11 November 2014 in his address to the nation for 2015, Nazarbayev proclaimed Kazakhstan's New Economic Policy – The Path to the Future (Nurly Zhol).[116] The new economic policy implies large-scale state investment in infrastructure over the next several years.[117] In the short term, the program \"Nurly Zhol\" will apply the anti-crisis measures to overcome the turbulence in the global economy.[118] The long-term measures of the state program of infrastructure development will help to create a strong platform for new growth.[118]\n\n\nKazakhstan has identified five priorities for modernization of the state and the economy to maintain competitiveness in the Fourth Industrial Revolution.[119]\n\n\nKazakhstan was ranked 36th in the Ease of Doing Business report released by the World Bank Group in 2018. The report's rankings rate ease of regulations for businesses and strength of property rights.\n\n\nThe Heritage Foundation, a Washington DC – based research center, ranked Kazakhstan 41st in its Index of Economic Freedom 2018. Its overall score has increased by 0.1 point, still being only \"moderately free\" with significant improvements in investment freedom and government integrity offsetting steep declines in fiscal health and monetary freedom.[120]\n\n\nKazakhstan aimed in 2017 to boost its economy by attracting private investors interested in developing national companies. This is the main goal of privatization that is expected to decrease the share of public property to 15% of GDP. Such companies as Kazakhstan Railways, Samruk-Energo, Kazatomprom, Kaspost, KazMunayGas and Air Astana are expected to be sold through IPO.[121]\n\n\nKazakhstan fell from 32nd to the 38th place in the 2018 IMD World Competitiveness ranking. The report evaluates business efficiency, public finance and domestic economy.[122]\n\n\n\n### Privatisation 2016–2020[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2015, Kazakhstan Government approved new privatization plan for 2016 – 2020.[123] It is a large-scale privatization program that continues the privatization of 2014 and includes 60 major state-owned companies.[124] According to Kazakh Finance ministry, the state budget got ₸6.99 billion (US$20.6 million) from the deals reached within the 2014–2016 privatization program as of 20 Sept. 2016. Kazakhstan's privatization program aims to reduce the state participation in the economy to 15 percent, which is the level set for countries of the OECD.[125]\n\n\n\n### Special Economic Zones[edit]\n\n\nA Special Economic Zone (SEZ) is a part of Kazakhstan's territory, which has a special legal regime, with all the necessary infrastructure, to carry out priority activities.[126]\n\n\nOn the territory of the Republic of Kazakhstan, there are 12 special economic zones with different sectoral orientations:\n\n\n\n1. SEZ \"Astana – New City\"\n2. SEZ \"Saryarka\"\n3. SEZ \"National Industrial Petrochemical Technopark\"\n4. SEZ \"Seaport Aktau\"\n5. SEZ \"Ontustik\"\n6. SEZ \"Chemical Park Taraz\"\n7. SEZ \"Khorgos – East Gate\"\n8. SEZ \"Park of Innovative Technologies\"\n9. SEZ \"Pavlodar\"\n10. SEZ \"Astana – Technopolis\"\n11. SEZ \"Turkistan\"\n12. SEZ \"ICBC\" Khorgos\"[127]\n\n\n### Small and medium-sized enterprises[edit]\n\n\nA new program to support small businesses was launched in Kazakhstan in February 2015.[128] 2015 is expected to be a pilot period of the program.[128] During that period the initiative will be focused on three major areas, notably agribusiness, machinery building and production of construction materials, and is to be further extended to other industries.[128]\n\n\nIn May 2015 the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) agreed to provide €41 million for technical cooperation projects, advisory support to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and to introduce a Women in Business program.[129]\n\n\nIn 2016 the number of Kazakhstan's telecom start-ups increased by 10% compared to 2015. Around 9,400 small telecom companies are currently registered in the country.[130]\n\n\nThe Kazakh Government provides extensive support to businesses, especially SMEs. The development of SMEs is an integral part of Kazakhstan's *Business Road Map 2020* state programme. The share of SMEs in Kazakhstan's GDP increased from 24.9% in 2015 to 28.4% in 2018. Kazakhstan plans to raise this indicator to 50% by 2050.[131]\n\n\n\n## Recent miscellany[edit]\n\n\nKazakhstan was ranked 54th 2017 Economic Freedom of the World report published by Fraser Institute, but ranks 12 places below on place 66 when adjusted by the Gender Disparity Index, which captures the degree to which women around the world have the same legal rights as men and adjusts the economic freedom score accordingly. This shows a large disadvantage of women in business.[132]\n\n\nIn recent years a trade route has been established between Kazakhstan and the United States. It now makes up 54% of the World's salt imports and exports by volume (350,000 tonnes per year).[133][*clarification needed*]\n\n\nIn 2021, 14 products developed by Kazakh scientists began being exported to China, Russia, Turkey, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, and the Czech Republic. These products include, but are not limited to, food & drinks based on milk whey; probiotics; an anti-fungal drug; biological sanitation products.[134]\n\n\nIn 2021, it was reported that the number of young female entrepreneurs in Kazakhstan has increased by 15 percent.[135]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* KazKuat (2005), state-owned organization for domestic hydro-electric sector\n* Yerbolat Dosayev, Minister of National Economy\n* Vladimir Shkolnik, Minister of Energy\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"World Economic Outlook Database, April 2019\". *IMF.org*.

In the first quarter of 2019, Saudi Arabia's budget had its first surplus since 2016. This surplus of $10.10 billion was achieved due to an increase in oil and non-oil revenues.[20]\n\n\n\n\n## Economic overview[edit]\n\n\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980–2021 (with IMF staff estimates in 2022–2027).

oil producer. Proven reserves, according to figures provided by the Saudi government, are estimated to be 260 billion barrels (41 km3), which is about one-quarter of the world oil reserves. Petroleum in Saudi Arabia is not only plentiful but also located under pressure close to the earth's surface, which makes it less expensive and more profitable to extract compared to other places.[23] The petroleum sector accounts for roughly 87% of Saudi budget revenues, 90% of export earnings, and 42% of GDP.[24] Saudi Arabia's oil reserves and production are largely managed by the state-owned corporation Saudi Aramco.[25]\n\n\nAnother 40% of the GDP comes from the private sector. An estimated 7.5 (2013) million foreigners work legally in Saudi Arabia[26] and play a crucial role in developing the Saudi economy, for example in the oil and service sectors. The government has been encouraging the growth of the private sector for many years to decrease the kingdom's dependence on oil and to increase employment opportunities for the swelling Saudi population. In recent decades, the government started allowing private sector activity and foreign investor participation in certain sectors, such as power generation and telecommunications, and acceded to the World Trade Organization. During much of the 2000s, high oil prices[27] allowed the government to post budget surpluses and boost spending on job training and education, infrastructure development, and government salaries.\n\n\nWith its absolute monarchy, large state sector, and supply of welfare benefits, the Saudi economy has been described asː\n\n\n\n\n>  A bewildering (at least to outsiders) combination of a feudal fealty system and a more modern political patronage one. At every level in every sphere of activity, Saudis maneuver through life manipulating individual privileges, favours, obligations, and connections. By the same token, the government bureaucracy is a maze of overlapping or conflicting power centers under the patronage of various royal princes with their own priorities and agendas to pursue and dependents to satisfy.[28]\n> \n> \n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: History of the oil industry in Saudi Arabia\n\n![](image)Dammam No. 7 on March 4, 1938, the day the well struck oil in commercial quantities, becoming the first in the kingdom to do so\nSaudi Arabia was a subsistence economy until the 1930s. In 1933, the Saudi government signed an oil concession agreement with the Standard Oil Company of California;[29] five years later, commercial volumes of oil were discovered in the kingdom.[30][31] The development of oil fields continued in Saudi Arabia, managed mainly by Arabian American Oil Company (Aramco), a company formed by the partnership of Texaco and Chevron.[32] In 1951, the first offshore field in the Middle East was established by Aramco at Raʾs Al-Saffāniyyah area.[33] By 1949, Saudi oil production reached 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) and rose rapidly to 1 million bpd in 1954.[34][35] Moreover, in 1951, Aramco started operating the Trans-Arabian Pipeline that moved oil from the eastern region of Saudi Arabia to the Mediterranean Sea through Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon. However, in 1981, this line was no longer used after a new line began operations that linked Jubail on the Persian Gulf and Yanbu on the Red Sea. The new pipe contributed greatly to speed up oil transport.[33] In 1960, OPEC was established, with Saudi Arabia as one of its founding members.[36] During the 1973 oil crisis, the price of oil rose from $3 per barrel to nearly $12, and the Saudi economy started growing rapidly,[37] with GDP increasing from approximately $15 billion in 1973 to almost $184 billion by 1981.[38] After gradually purchasing Aramco assets, the Saudi government nationalized the company in 1980. In 1988, Saudi Aramco was established to take over the responsibilities of Aramco.[39]\n\n\nIn 1980, the price of oil peaked, and demand started decreasing as a result of recessions in industrialized nations and more efficient oil use, which produced surpluses.[40] This created a worldwide oil glut, with the price of oil dropping from approximately $36 per barrel in 1980 to approximately $14 by 1986.[41] Saudi oil production, which had increased to almost 10 million barrels (1,600,000 m3) per day during 1980–81, fell 80% to about 2 million barrels per day (320,000 m3/d) in 1985.[42] Budgetary deficits developed, and the government drew down its foreign assets.[43] As a result of the oil glut and the pressure from declines in production, after 1985 Saudi Arabia started enforcing production quotas more harshly for the OPEC members.[44]\n\n\nIn June 1993, Saudi Aramco absorbed the state marketing and refining company (SAMAREC), becoming the world's largest fully integrated oil company. Most Saudi oil is exported by tankers from oil terminals at Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah in the Persian Gulf. The remaining oil for export is transported via the east–west pipeline across the kingdom to the Red Sea port of Yanbu. A major new gas initiative was supposed to attract significant investments from the American and European oil companies to develop non-associated gas fields in three separate parts of Saudi Arabia. Following final technical agreements with concession awardees in December 2001, development was expected to begin in 2002.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)A map of world oil reserves according to OPEC, 2013\nIn the 1990s, Saudi Arabia experienced a significant contraction of oil revenues combined with a high rate of population growth. Per capita income fell from a high of $11,700 at the height of the oil boom in 1981 to $6,300 in 1998.[45] Taking into account the impact of the real oil price changes on the kingdom's real gross domestic income, the real command-basis GDP was computed to be 330.381 billion 1999 USD in 2010.[46] Increases in oil prices in the early 2000s helped boost per capita GDP to $17000 in 2007 dollars (about $7,400 adjusted for inflation),[47] but have declined since oil price drop in mid-2014.[48]\n\n\nHowever, beginning in late 1997, Saudi Arabia again faced the challenge of low oil prices. Because of a combination of factors—the East Asian economic crises, a warm winter in the West caused by El Niño, and an increase in non-OPEC oil production—demand for oil decreased and pulled oil prices down by more than one-third.[49]\n\n\nSaudi Arabia was a key player in coordinating the successful 1999 campaign of OPEC and other oil-producing countries to raise the oil price to its highest level since the (Persian) Gulf War by managing petroleum supply and production. That same year, Saudi Arabia established the Supreme Economic Council to formulate and better coordinate economic development policies to accelerate institutional and industrial reforms.[50]\n\n\nSaudi Arabia joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2005 after many years of negotiations.\n\n\n\n### Foreign investment[edit]\n\n\nBefore 2000, there were strict limits placed on foreign direct investment in Saudi Arabia. The 1979 Foreign Investment Act prohibited foreign ownership in some sectors of the economy, allowed foreign investment only if the investor qualified for a license based on their expertise, and gave priority to businesses that were Saudi-owned or partially Saudi-owned.[51]\n\n\nHowever, in the mid-1990s, foreign ownership rules were relaxed, with investment sought in telecommunications, utilities, and financial services.[52] The 2000 Foreign Direct Investment Act made substantial changes to the rules on foreign investment, including allowing projects to be run by 100% foreign-owned companies for the first time.[51]\n\n\nSince 2008, extensive Saudi land investment has taken place, especially in Africa. For more, see the section on the Non-petroleum sector.\n\n\nAccording to UNCTAD's June 2018 report, Saudi Arabia's foreign direct investment was only $1.4 billion in 2017, down from $7.5 billion the year before and as much as $12.2 billion in 2012. The fall in investment is attributed to negative intra-company loans by foreign multinationals and various divestments.[53] In the first quarter of 2018, net capital outflows were running at approximately 5% of GDP, compared to less than 2% of GDP in late 2016.[54] However, according to a report published in Trading Economics, in the second quarter of 2018, foreign direct investment in the country raised by $882 million.[55] Moreover, SAGIA's data indicate that licenses provided to foreign investment increased by 130% in the first quarter of 2018 as a result of reforms in the economy.[56]\n\n\nAs Saudi oil income declined in the late 2010s, the kingdom's international debt soared. In December 2018, Saudi Arabia announced it would be issuing bonds worth approximately 120 billion riyals ($32 billion) to cover its 4.2% GDP deficit of 131 billion riyals.[57] In January 2019, the kingdom sold bonds worth $7.5 billion.[58] In almost two and a half years, bonds worth $60 billion were sold by Saudi, which became one of the biggest borrowers globally.[59]\n\n\nIn September 2018, the Public Investment Fund completed a deal with a group of global lenders for a loan of $11 billion.[60] The deal raised more than initially planned and was the first time the PIF had incorporated loans and debt instruments into its funding.[61] According to data from Fitch Ratings, over two years starting from May 2016 Saudi Arabia went from having zero debt to raising $68 billion in dollar-denominated bonds and syndicated loans—one of the fastest rates among emerging economies.[62]\n\n\nForeign investments in the kingdom witnessed a rapid increase in the first quarter of 2019. The number of new licenses approved for foreign businesses grew 70% over 2018. Most licenses were approved for British and Chinese companies, which drove the increase.[63] In the first quarter of 2019, foreign investment in Saudi Arabia jumped by 28%.[20]\n\n\n\n### Diversification and the development plans[edit]\n\n\nThe government has sought to allocate its petroleum income to transform its relatively undeveloped, oil-based economy into a modern industrial state, while maintaining the kingdom's traditional Islamic values and customs. Although economic planners have not achieved all their goals, the economy has progressed rapidly. Oil wealth has increased the standard of living of most Saudis. However, significant population growth has strained the government's ability to finance further improvements in the country's standard of living. Heavy dependence on petroleum revenue continues, but industry and agriculture now account for a larger share of economic activity. The mismatch between the job skills of Saudi graduates and the needs of the private job market at all levels remains the principal obstacle to economic diversification and development; about 4.6 million non-Saudis are employed in the economy.[64]\n\n\nSaudi Arabia first began to diversify its economy to reduce dependency on oil in the 1970s as part of its first five-year development plan. Basic petrochemical industries using petroleum byproducts as feedstock were developed.[65] The fishing villages of al-Jubail on the Persian Gulf and Yanbu on the Red Sea were developed. However, their effect on Saudi Arabia's economic fortunes has been small.[66]\n\n\nSaudi Arabia's first two development plans, covering the 1970s, emphasized infrastructure. The results were impressive—the total length of paved highways tripled, power generation increased by a factor of 28, and the capacity of the seaports grew by a factor of 10. For the third plan (1980–85), the emphasis changed. Spending on infrastructure declined, shifting instead to education, health, and social services. The share for diversifying and expanding productive sectors of the economy (primary industry) did not rise as planned, but the two industrial cities of Jubail and Yanbu—which were built around the use of the country's oil and gas to produce steel, petrochemicals, fertilizer, and refined oil products—were largely completed.[64]\n\n\nIn the fourth plan (1985–90), the country's basic infrastructure was viewed as largely complete, but education and training remained areas of concern. Private enterprise was encouraged, and foreign investment in the form of joint ventures with Saudi public and private companies was welcomed. The private sector became more important, rising to 70% of non-oil GDP by 1987. While still concentrated in trade and commerce, private investment increased in industry, agriculture, banking, and construction companies. These private investments were supported by generous government financing and incentive programs. The objective was for the private sector to have 70% to 90% ownership in most joint venture enterprises.[64]\n\n\nThe fifth plan (1990–95) emphasized consolidation of the country's defences; improved and more efficient government social services; regional development; and, most importantly, creating greater private-sector employment opportunities for Saudis by reducing the number of foreign workers.[64]\n\n\nThe sixth plan (1996–2000) focused on lowering the cost of government services without cutting them and sought to expand educational training programs. The plan called for reducing the kingdom's dependence on the petroleum sector by diversifying economic activity, particularly in the private sector, with special emphasis on industry and agriculture. It also continued the effort to \"Saudize\" the labour force.[64]\n\n\nThe seventh plan (2000–2004) focused more on economic diversification and a greater role of the private sector in the Saudi economy. For 2000–04, the government aimed at an average GDP growth rate of 3.16% each year, with projected growths of 5.04% for the private sector and 4.01% for the non-oil sector. The government also set a target of creating 817,300 new jobs for Saudi nationals.[64] By 2007, advertising expenditures had reached new peaks due to emphasis on value-added manufacturing.[67][*failed verification*]\n\n\nIn 2016, the main investing countries in Saudi Arabia were the US, UAE, France, Singapore, Kuwait, and Malaysia. They mainly invested in chemical industry, real estate, tourism, fossil fuels, automobiles, and machinery.[68] As part of its diversification, Saudi Arabia arranged major refinery contracts with Chinese and other companies.[69]\n\n\nAfter Saudi Arabia became a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2005, the overall foreign investment environment in Saudi Arabia improved thanks to the kingdom's stable economy, massive oil reserves, high power of expenditure, developed infrastructure, reinforced finance, and banking system. Since then, and pursuant to its commitment to the WTO, Saudi Arabia has been developing trade-related policies and legislations. Moreover, foreign investment has been highly encouraged by Saudi Vision 2030 and its economic diversification.[68]\n\n\nSince 2017, to boost the economy and decrease the country's dependency on oil, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has introduced multiple changes, such as raising the prices of gasoline and electricity, levying new taxes, and prioritizing Saudi workers over foreign workers. However, some government officials claimed the policies were causing serious ill effects on the economy. Saudi businessmen reported a decline in sales for 2018, and a few blamed the government.[70]\n\n\nIn 2019, the *Financial Times* reported that the plans to float state-owned oil beneficiary Saudi Aramco were stranded between the company's attachment to the oil ministry and the desire to meet international standards. However, Energy Minister Khalid Al Falih has long maintained that Aramco's association with the state is a \"win-win policy\" for both parties.[71]\n\n\n\n### Future[edit]\n\n\nSaudi Arabia has announced plans to invest about $47 billion in three of the world's largest and most ambitious petrochemical projects. These include the $27 billion Ras Tanura integrated refinery and petrochemical project, the $9 billion Saudi Kayan[72] petrochemical complex at Jubail Industrial City, and the $10 billion Petro Rabigh refinery upgrade project. Together, the three projects will employ more than 150,000 technicians and engineers.[73] Upon completion in 2015–16, the Ras Tanura project would become the world's largest petrochemical facility of its kind with a combined production capacity of 11 million tons per year of different petrochemical and chemical products.[*needs update?*] The products will include ethylene, propylene, aromatics, polyethylene, ethylene oxide, chlorine derivatives, and glycol.[73]\n\n\nSaudi Arabia made plans to launch six \"economic cities\" (e.g., King Abdullah Economic City) in an effort to diversify the economy and provide jobs.[74] At a total construction cost of $60 billion (2013), they were \"expected to contribute $150bn to the economy\".[75]\n[76] However, these cities have failed to attract either the population or the financial investment that the government claimed they would.[77]\n\n\nThe privatization program Saudi Vision 2030 is running behind schedule. Oil prices have doubled since the government began to consider the program in 2015. Delay in Aramco's initial public offering further demonstrated a lack of urgency to privatize, even though in July 2018, the International Monetary Fund urged accelerating the process.[78]\n\n\nAs Vision 2030 has been recently adopted by the Saudi government, several reforms[*which?*] have been undertaken, including in business environments and the financial sector. Moreover, the government has been seeking to achieve greater transparency by issuing a draft law regarding the involvement of the private sector. Other reforms have been passed to increase manpower in the private sector.[79]\n\n\nAccording to many reports, the Saudi government is interested in granting more liberties to the foreign investment system and giving a 100% allowance to foreign investors to work in the wholesale and retail sector in certain cases.[68]\n\n\nThe Saudi Ministry of Commerce and Investment expected that the kingdom would see an increase in the GDP per capita from US$20,700 to $33,500 by 2020.[80] However, the GDP per capita by 2020 had stagnated at $US20,000.[81]\n\n\n\n## Employment[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Saudization and Foreign workers in Saudi Arabia\n\nAs of 2008, roughly two-thirds of workers employed in Saudi Arabia were foreigners, and in the private sector the proportion was approximately 90%.[82] In January 2014, the Saudi government claimed it had lowered the 90% rate, doubling the number of Saudi citizens working in the private sector to 1.5 million (compared to 10 million foreign expatriates working in the kingdom).[83]\n\n\nAccording to Reuters, economists \"estimate only 30–40 percent of working-age Saudis hold jobs or actively seek work\", although the official unemployment rate is only around 12 percent. Most Saudis with jobs are employed by the government, but the International Monetary Fund has warned that the government cannot support such a large payroll in the long term.[83][84] The government has announced a succession of plans since 2000 to deal with the imbalance by \"Saudization\" of the economy, but the foreign workforce and unemployment has continued to grow.[85] Since the beginning of 2017, however, Saudi Arabia has seen record numbers of foreign workers leaving the country as the Saudi government imposed higher fees on expatriate workers, with more than 677,000 foreigners leaving the kingdom. This has done little to lower the unemployment rate, which rose to 12.9 percent, the highest on record.[86]\n\n\nEach year, about a quarter-million young Saudis enter the job market. With the first phase of Saudization into effect, 70% of sales jobs are expected to be filled by Saudis. However, the private sector still remains hugely dominated by foreigners. The rate of local unemployment is 12.9%, its highest in more than a decade.[87] According to a report published by Bloomberg Economics in 2018, the government needs to produce 700000 jobs by 2020 to meet its 9% unemployment target.[87]\n\n\nOne obstacle is social resistance to certain types of employment. Jobs in service and sales are considered totally unacceptable for citizens of Saudi Arabia—both to potential employees and customers.[88]\n\n\n\n## Non-petroleum resources sector[edit]\n\n\nSaudi Arabia has natural resources other than oil, including small mineral deposits of gold, silver, iron, copper, zinc, manganese, tungsten, lead, sulfur, phosphate, soapstone, and feldspar.[66] The country has a small agricultural sector, primarily in the southwest where annual rainfall averages 400 mm (16 in). The country is one of the world's largest producers of dates. Prior to 2009, wheat was grown using desalinated water for irrigation,[66] but was phased out by 2016 due to costly water usage.[89] As of 2009, the livestock population amounted to 7.4 million sheep, 4.2 million goats, half a million camels, and a quarter of a million cattle.[66]\n\n\nAlthough the jobs created by the roughly two million annual Hajj pilgrims do not last long, they employ more people than the oil industry—40,000 temporary jobs (butchers, barbers, coach drivers, etc.)—and generates US$2–3 billion in revenue.[90]\n\n\nIn 2008, the \"Initiative for Saudi Agricultural Investment Abroad\" was launched, leading to extensive billion-dollar purchases of large tracts of land around the world, including in Ethiopia, Indonesia, Mali, Senegal, and Sudan. Described as land-grabbing by critics, in various instances these purchases have also led to uproars in the respective countries. Competing industrializing nations with food security problems seeking agricultural land include China, South Korea, and India, as well as the Persian Gulf States of Kuwait, Qatar, and the UAE.[91][92][93][94][95]\n\n\nIn 2016, Mohammad bin Salman announced Saudi Vision 2030, a plan to reduce Saudi Arabia's dependence on oil, diversify its economy, and develop public service sectors such as health, education, infrastructure, recreation, and tourism.\n\n\n\n## Real estate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Residential homes in Yanbu\nOne of the fastest growing sectors in the country is real estate, supported by the introduction of real estate investment trusts (REITs). Despite significant growth in the number of REITs,[96][97] the sector has yet to achieve its full potential due to shortages in both residential and commercial real estate. A number of regional experts[*who?*] believe that most issues will be resolved as the market becomes more mature.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nReal estate plays a fundamental role in the country's non-oil economy. In 2016, the value of real estate transactions including sales of existing units amounted to $74.91 billion from 15 October to 16 September.[98] This is a major drop compared to the number of transactions recorded a decade earlier, which reached $239.93 billion. The real estate sector has been driven recently by strong local demand fundamentals and only a small amount of speculation.\n\n\nOwnership of land property in Saudi Arabia is generally restricted to Saudis, but this is subject to certain qualifications. For example, Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) nationals and GCC companies have certain rights to own land, subject to a number of restrictions.[99] Foreigners (being non-GCC nationals) are entitled to ownership and investment in real estate with some conditions. A foreign company needs to have a foreign investment license from the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority (SAGIA) and the owned real estate must be related to a particular investment project for property development.[100] A foreign individual needs to have normal legal residency status and a permit from the Ministry of the Interior to own land or property.[100]\n\n\nThe major expansion in this sector attracted the top real estate consultancies—such as Jones Lang LaSalle,[101] Knight Frank,[102] and Cluttons[103]—who have now opened offices in the country. Beyond this, demand for professional real estate services is attracting regional educators such as DREI to provide courses on Saudi real estate, and even dedicated books focused on the market, such as *Saudi Real Estate Companion*.\n\n\nReal estate plays an important role in the Saudi Vision 2030, which maps out significant commitments by the Saudi government relating to housing and the development of land for a variety of uses. In particular, Vision 2030 states: \"Where it exists in strategic locations, we will also capitalize on the government's reserves of real estate. We will allocate prime areas within cities for educational institutions, retail, and entertainment centers, large areas along our coasts will be dedicated to tourist projects and appropriate lands will be allocated for industrial projects.\"[104]\n\n\nIn 2016, new rules were introduced by the Capital Market Authority to form REITs. This aimed at opening the real estate market to a wide range of investors.[99][97] The REITs consist of units representing the ownership of the underlying real estate. These units are offered to the public and traded on the Saudi Stock Exchange.[99][105]\n\n\nThe introduction of REITs was a part of the National Transformation program, one of Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 programs, and has targets of:\n\n\n\n* Increasing the real estate sector contribution from GDP of five percent to 10 percent annually.[99]\n* Supporting the construction of 1.5 million homes by providing the required private capital.[99]\n* Establishing partnerships with private sector developers to develop government land for housing projects.\n* Establishing fast-track licenses and special finance packages to encourage private sector investment in housing projects.\n\n\nIn 2019, the Saudi government introduced the Premium Residency scheme, which allows wealthy investors of any nationality to purchase residency and buy and sell real estate.[106]\n\n\n\n## Automotive[edit]\n\n\n![](image)KSU Gazal-1\nIn 2010, the KSU Gazal-1, an SUV built by students at King Saud University, became the first mass-produced vehicle manufactured domestically in Saudi Arabia.[107]\n\n\nIn 2022, the US car company Lucid Motors announced plans to build an electric vehicle manufacturing plant in Jeddah.[108] Construction began in May 2022, and the plant will have capacity for 150,000 vehicles.[109]\n\n\nToyota is the leading brand in Saudi Arabia, accounting for 30% of car sales in the country; they are followed by Kia and Hyundai who together make up 26%, and Renault/Nissan/Mitsubishi at 9%. The American Big Three auto makers (Ford, GM, and Chrysler) comprise the remainder.[110] As for the quantity of vehicle units sold, in the first half of 2023, Toyota had the highest in the country with 112,584 and the second-most was the Hyundai badge with 47,218.[111]\n\n\n\n## Private sector[edit]\n\n\nSaudi Arabia's private sector is dominated by a handful of big businesses in the service sector, primarily in construction and real estate, such as Olayan, Zamil, Almarai, Mobily, STC, SABIC, Sadara, Halliburton, Baker Hughes, Flynas, Hilton, Zain, Yanbu Cement, Alhokair, MBC, Mahfouz, Al Rajhi, and Alfanar. These firms are \"heavily dependent on government spending\", which is dependent on oil revenues.[112]\n\n\nFrom 2003 to 2013, \"several key services\" were privatized—municipal water supply, electricity, telecommunications—and parts of education and health care, traffic control, and car accident reporting were also privatized. According to Arab News columnist Abdel Aziz Aluwaisheg, \"in almost every one of these areas, consumers have raised serious concerns about the performance of these privatized entities.\"[113]\n\n\nA relatively small sector until a boom in the 1980s,[114] the food service industry in Saudi Arabia today is valued at around $13 billion.[115]\n\n\nTo provide the best support for the private sector and entrepreneurs, the kingdom announced a decision approved by the Saudi Cabinet in July 2019 allowing businesses in the country to be given the option to remain open 24 hours a day.[116] As of 2023, the average monthly salary for Saudis working in the private sector is SR9600, up 45% from SR6600 in the year 2018.[117]\n\n\n\n## Trade[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Saudi Arabian exports in 2006\nIn April 2000, the government established the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority to encourage foreign direct investment in Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia maintains a negative list of sectors in which foreign investment is prohibited, but the government planned to open some closed sectors such as telecommunications, insurance, and power transmission/distribution over time.[118]\n\n\nSaudi Arabia became a full World Trade Organization (WTO) member on 11 December 2005.[119] In 2019, the government established the General Authority for Foreign Trade to enhance the kingdom's international commercial and investment activities.[120]\n\n\nIn early July 2020, Saudi Arabia announced the nomination of its former Minister of Economy and Saudi royal court adviser, Mohammad Al-Tuwaijri, for the role of WTO's director-general.[121] The nominations were made public about a month after the WTO reported the kingdom for copyrights infringement following distribution of pirated sports broadcasting content on the state-owned broadcast service, BeoutQ.[122] The nomination of al-Tuwaijri received criticism from human rights groups in mid-August 2020, demanding the rejection of the Saudi nominee due to the kingdom's violation of human rights in addition to his silence over it.[123] On 7 October 2020, Al-Tuwaijri, along with other nominees from the UK and Kenya, lost the bid for the role due to lack of support, as compared to the nominees from Nigeria and South Korea who qualified for the final round of selection.[124]\n\n\nSaudi Arabia is part of the following trade organizations:\n\n\n\n* World Trade Organization (WTO)[119]\n* International Monetary Fund (IMF)[125]\n* International Chamber of Commerce (ICC)[126]\n* International Organization for Standardization (ISO)[127]\n* World Customs Organization (WCO)[128]\n\n\n## Challenges[edit]\n\n\nAmong the challenges to the Saudi economy include halting or reversing the decline in per capita income, improving education to prepare youth for the workforce and providing them with employment, diversifying the economy, stimulating the private sector and housing construction, and diminishing corruption and inequality. In answer to the question of why the Saudi economy is so dependent on foreign labor, the UN Arab Human Development Report blamed stunted social and economic development inhibited by lack of personal freedom, poor education, government hiring based on factors other than merit, and the exclusion of women.[129]\n\n\n\n### Income drop[edit]\n\n\nDespite possessing the second largest petroleum reserves in the world, per capita income dropped from approximately $18,000 at the height of the oil boom (1981) to $7,000 in 2001, according to one estimate.[130] As of 2013, due to the rapid population growth of Saudi Arabia,[131] per capita income in Saudi was \"a fraction of that of smaller Persian gulf neighbors\", even less than petroleum-poor Bahrain.[132]\n\n\nUnlike most developed countries, where GDP growth is a function of increases in productivity and inputs such as employment, in Saudi Arabia the fluctuation of oil prices is the most important factor in the growth or decline of domestic production. \"Saudi reserves are steadily being depleted, and no significant new discoveries have been found to replace them,\" according to Middle East journalist Karen House.[*as of?*] Saudi population grew sevenfold from 1960 to 2010,[133] and petrol prices are subsidized and cost users less than equivalent quantities of bottled water.[134] With production stagnant, growth in population and domestic energy consumption means a decline in per capita income unless oil prices rise to match that growth.[132]\n\n\n\n### Demographics[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Demographics of Saudi Arabia\n\nThe Saudi population is young. About 51% of the total population are under the age of 25 (as of February 2012).[135] According to a 2013 report by the International Monetary Fund, up to 1.6 million young nationals of the Persian Gulf countries (of which Saudi Arabia is the largest) will enter the workforce from 2013 to 2018, but the economies of those countries will have jobs in the private sector for less than half (approximately 600,000).[136]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Education in Saudi Arabia\n\nAccording to *The Economist*, the Saudi government has attempted in past years to raise employment by forcing \"companies to fill at least 30% of their positions\" with Saudi citizens. However, \"employers complained bitterly about the lack of skills among young locals; years of rote-learning and religious instruction fail to prepare them for the job market.\" However, many argue that young Saudis couldn't compete with foreigners due to the low compensation and salaries most companies had used to offer for employees from Asian, Indian subcontinent, and other Arab poor countries, which this cheap labor happily accepts; in addition to the bad work conditions, culture, and environment present in most of the Saudi private sector, largely due to the fact that it was initially modeled to accommodate very-low-income employees from other nations, not the Saudi medium-income and somewhat highly educated population. As a consequence, \"the quota has now been dropped and replaced with a more flexible system\".[137]\n\n\nAccording to scholar David Commins, the kingdom depends \"on huge numbers of expatriate workers to fill technical and administrative positions\" in part because of an educational system that, despite \"generous budgets\", has suffered from \"poorly trained teachers, low retention rates, lack of rigorous standards, weak scientific and technical instruction and excessive attention to religious subjects\".[138][139][140]\n\n\nA 2015 survey conducted by Bayt.com showed that over a quarter (28%) of professionals in North Africa and the Middle East believe that there is a skills shortage in their country of residence. This belief was even more prominent among respondents in Saudi Arabia (39%).[141]\n\n\n\n### Innovation[edit]\n\n\nSaudi has not been a hotbed of technological innovation. The number of Saudi patents registered in the United States between 1977 and 2010 came to 382—less than twelve per year—compared to 84,840 patents for South Korea or 20,620 for Israel during that period.[142][143] However, in 2017 Saudi Arabia was granted 664 patents by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, ranking 23rd among 92 countries.[144][145] The number of granted patents was double that of all Arab countries combined during the same period.[146] Saudi Arabia hopes to increase technological innovation, particularly with the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, and thus to stimulate the economy.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Bureaucracy[edit]\n\n\nBusiness journalist Karen House criticized the Saudi bureaucracy, explaining that someone seeking to start a business in Saudi Arabia:\n\n\n\n\n> has to complete innumerable applications and documents at multiple layers of multiple ministries, which invariably requires seeking favours from various patronage networks and accumulating obligations along the way, most probably including having to hire less-than-competent dependents of his patrons. Then, for any business of any size, government contracts, not private competition, are the financial lifeblood. So this means more patrons, more favours, and more obligations. Not surprisingly, Saudi businesses that can compete outside the protected Saudi market are few.[147]\n> \n> \n\n\n### Corruption[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Corruption in Saudi Arabia\n\nThe cost of maintaining the Royal Family is estimated by some to be about US$10 billion per year.[66]\n\n\nA 2005 survey by the Riyadh Chamber of Commerce found that 77% of businessmen polled felt they had to 'bypass' the law to conduct their operations. By 2012, \"businessmen say it has only gotten worse\".[148]\n\n\nSaudi Arabia has been severely criticized for failing to tackle money laundering and international terrorism financing. A report released by the Financial Action Task Force on 24 September 2018, says, \"Saudi Arabia is not effectively investigating and prosecuting individuals involved in larger scale or professional [money laundering] activity\" and is \"not effectively confiscating the proceeds of crime\".[149]\n\n\n\n### Poverty[edit]\n\n\nEstimates of the number of Saudis below the poverty line range from between 12.7%[150] and 25%.[151] Press reports and private estimates as of 2013 \"suggest that between 2 million and 4 million\" of the country's native Saudis live on \"less than about $530 a month\" – about $17 a day – considered the poverty line in Saudi Arabia.[151][152]\n\n\nThe Saudi state discourages calling attention to or complaining about poverty. In December 2011, days after the Arab Spring uprisings, the Saudi interior ministry detained reporter Feros Boqna and two colleagues (Hussam al-Drewesh and Khaled al-Rasheed) and held them for almost two weeks for questioning after they uploaded a 10-minute video on the topic (*Mal3ob 3alena*, or 'We are being cheated') to YouTube.[153][154] Authors of the video claim that 22% of Saudis are considered to be poor (2009) and 70% of Saudis do not own their houses.[155] \nStatistics on the issue are not available through the UN resources because the Saudi government does not issue poverty figures.[156] Observers researching the issue prefer to stay anonymous[157] because of the risk of being arrested, like Feras Boqna.[154][158]\n\n\n\n### Housing[edit]\n\n\n50% of Saudi Arabia's citizens owned their own home in 2017, a rise from 30% in 2011 but below the international average rate of 70%.[159] In 2011, analysts estimated 500,000 new homes per year were needed to match the growth in Saudi population, but as of early 2014 only 300,000 to 400,000 houses per year were being built.[160]\n\n\nOne problem is that the government Real Estate Development Fund (REDF)—which provides 81% of all loans for housing—had an 18-year waiting list for loans due to pent-up demand. Another is that the REDF's maximum loan is 500,000 SR ($133,000), while in 2012 the average price for a small free-standing home in Riyadh is more than double that—1.23 million SR ($328,000).[161] However, as part of the economic reforms undertaken by the government to enhance national living standards, new funding solutions have been established to boost the mortgages for existing and new borrowers to help finance their housing plans. This was announced in August 2018 by the Minister of Housing, Mr. Majed Al-Hogail.[162]\n\n\nA major reason for the high cost of housing is the high cost of land. In urban areas, the price of land has been bid up because nearly all of it is owned by the Saudi elite (members of the royal family or other wealthy Saudis), who have lobbied the government for land \"giveaways\".[160] Landlords have seen prices rocket by 50% from 2011 to 2013.[160] The owners benefit from these price increases as they hold the land for future development.[163][164] To deal with the key \"land banking\" issue, the Minister of Housing suggested in 2013 that vacant property within city limits could be subject to a tax. However, no firm plans for any tax have been unveiled.[160]\n\n\n\n### Further diversification[edit]\n\n\nAccording to journalist Karen House, \"every\" Saudi five-year plan \"since the first one in 1970\" has called for diversifying the economy beyond oil, but with marginal success.[165]\n\n\nAs of 2007, manufacturing outside of the petroleum industry contributed 10% to Saudi Arabian GDP and less than 6% of total employment.[166]\n\n\n\n### Private sector growth[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, the imposition of a 5% value-added tax (VAT) brought private-sector growth to a halt. Consumer spending was also restrained after a sharp increase in prices for energy, electricity, and water earlier in 2018. The kingdom witnessed a mass departure of around 750,000 foreign workers after imposing new government levies on ex-pat workers. The government is also forcing small-business owners to hire Saudi nationals at comparatively higher wages than foreign workers. Gaining money from large, direct foreign investments is also not working in favor of the government. Rich Saudis are reluctant to invest within the kingdom due to the fear of triggering government scrutiny.[167]\n\n\nOn 11 May 2020, the government announced that it would triple the kingdom's VAT on goods and services, raising it from 5% to 15%.[168] It also stated that the increase in VAT—introduced due to the country's current financial crisis due to plummeting oil prices and impact of coronavirus—would also be followed by a cut in monthly allowance for state workers worth approximately $266, and financial benefits for contractors.[169] \nAramco decreased the production of its Arab Light grade of crude oil by a significant amount[*by how much?*] to be shipped to Asia. The firm also cut down oil pricing for its US buyers following wavering demand for fuel due to the global relapse of the coronavirus pandemic.[170]\n\n\nAccording to the General Authority for Statistics, Saudi Arabia's inflation accelerated to 6.2% in August 2020, as compared to the same month last year. The report states that the annual inflation rate increased from only 0.5% (in June) to 6.1% (in July), before the increase of VAT to 15% from 5% was introduced, effective from 1 July 2020.[171]\n\n\n\n## Investment[edit]\n\n\nSaudi Arabia has two stock exchanges, the Tadawul and The Saudi Parallel Market (Nomu), whose financial markets are regulated by the Capital Market Authority.[172][173] The stock market capitalization of listed companies in Saudi Arabia is valued at $2.22 trillion. According to the International Institute for Management Development, Saudi Arabia experienced the largest improvement in business competitiveness of all countries in 2019; the kingdom rose 13 places to 26th in the world.[174]\n\n\n\n### Doing business[edit]\n\n\nSaudi Arabia is among the countries with the most notable improvement in doing business, according to the World Bank Group's \"Doing Business\" 2020 report. The country jumped 30 places to rank 62nd in ease of doing business, compared to the previous year.[175][176][177] Previously, the kingdom had been declining in the overall rankings, from 22nd in 2013[178] to 92nd in 2018.[179]\n\n\nAccording to the World Bank in 2019, Saudi Arabia had conducted reforms in eight areas of business: (1) starting a business, (2) getting construction permits, (3) getting electricity, (4) getting credit, (5) protecting minority investors, (6) trading across borders, (7) enforcing contracts, and (8) resolving insolvency.[176]\n\n\nSaudi Arabian companies dominate 2009's \"MEED 100\", with companies listed on the Tadawul accounting for 29 out of the region's 100 biggest publicly quoted companies ranked by market capitalization. Just three of the 20 companies that have dropped out of the top 100 over the past year are listed on the Saudi stock exchange.[180]\n\n\nForeigners are allowed to wholly own limited liability companies in the majority of industries. Non-Saudi nationals are required to obtain a foreign capital investment license from the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority.[181]\n\n\nWith a total of 291 foreign investor licenses issued in the second quarter of 2019, the kingdom has witnessed an increase in international investment, reflecting the economic reforms under the Saudi Vision 2030. Obtaining a foreign investor license became more straightforward as it requires only two documents, and it is processed in three hours.[182]\n\n\n\n### Controversies[edit]\n\n\nSharmarke Gaani, a Somali businessman, travelled to Saudi Arabia on 25 January 2021 to spread his home-health business in the country, which he had visited twice since 2017. On his arrival, the New Albany businessman faced 3-day detention for no discernible reason. According to his statements, the detention facility was cramped, cold, and didn't offer masks despite housing eight other inmates during the COVID-19 pandemic. Gaani claimed that he suffered \"mentally, physically and emotionally\" and just wanted \"justice\". His call to the United States consulate in the country went unanswered. On the third day of his detention, Gaani was informed that he could leave, without receiving any explanation or apology for the incident.[183]\n\n\n\n### Companies[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of largest companies of Saudi Arabia and List of companies of Saudi Arabia\n\n#### Saudi Aramco[edit]\n\n\nSaudi Aramco (officially the Saudi Arabian Oil Co.) is Saudi Arabia's national oil, petroleum, and natural gas company headquartered in Dhahran.[184][185][186] Saudi Aramco was listed for public trading on 10 December 2019 and had a valuation as of US$2 trillion as of 12 December 2019.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nSaudi Aramco has both the second largest proven crude oil reserves, which it claims to be more than 260 billion barrels (4.1×1010 m3), and the largest daily oil production.[187] The company operates the world's largest single hydrocarbon network, the Master Gas System. Its yearly production is 3.479 billion barrels (553,100,000 m3),[188] and it manages over 100 oil and gas fields in Saudi Arabia, including 284.8 trillion standard cubic feet (scf) of natural gas reserves.[188] Saudi Aramco owns the Ghawar Field, the world's largest oil field, and the Shaybah Field, another one of the world's largest oil fields.[189]\n\n\nOn 16 November 2020, Saudi Aramco announced hiring banks to sell dollar-denominated bonds with the aim of improving finances after the coronavirus pandemic caused a sharp fall in the global demand for crude oil. Aramco's multi-tranche offer was set to run between 3 and 50 years, depending on the market conditions. The banks hired for the transaction included Citi Bank, Goldman Sachs International, HSBC, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and NCB Capital.[190] Other banks involved in the deal included BNP Paribas, BOC International, BofA Securities, Credit Agricole, First Abu Dhabi Bank, Mizuho, MUFG, SMBC Nikko and Societe Generale.[191]\n\n\nIn 2021, Saudi Aramco made a net-income of 95.5 billion riyals ($25.5 billion) in the second quarter alone, which was the highest level since 2018.[192]\n\n\n\n#### SABIC[edit]\n\n\nThe Saudi Arabian Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC was established by a royal decree in 1976 to produce chemicals, polymers, and fertilizers. In 2008, SABIC was Asia's largest (in terms of market capitalization) and most profitable publicly listed non-oil company, the world's fourth-largest petrochemical company, the second-largest producer of ethylene glycol and methanol in the world, the third-largest producer of polyethylene and overall the fourth-largest producer of polypropylene and polyolefin. It ranked 186th as the world's largest corporation on the Fortune Global 500 for 2009. Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings claimed SABIC to be the world's largest producer of polymers and the Persian Gulf region's largest steel producer for 2005 and assigned SABIC an \"A\" corporate credit rating. In 2008, Fortune 500 ranking records SABIC revenues at $40.2 billion, profits at $5.8 billion, and assets standing at $72.4 billion.[193]\n\n\n\n#### Ma'aden (company)[edit]\n\n\nMa'aden was formed as a Saudi joint stock company on 23 March 1997 for the purpose of facilitating the development of Saudi Arabia's mineral resources. Ma'aden's activities have focused on its active gold business which has grown in recent years to include the operation of five gold mines: Mahd Ad Dahab, Al Hajar, Sukhaybarat, Bulghah, and Al Amar. Ma'aden is now expanding its activities beyond its gold business with the development of phosphates, aluminium, and other projects. In addition, since its formation, Ma'aden (through the Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources) has collaborated with the government and local legislators to develop a regulatory framework for the governance of the mining industry.\n\n\n\n#### ICT Services[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article needs to be **updated**. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. *(March 2022)*\n |\n\n\nSaudi Arabia experienced a boom in computer use since deregulation in 2002. The number of PCs per capita grew from 13% of the population owning a computer in 2002 to nearly 43% in 2005, leapfrogging the rest of West Asia. By 2018, 50.57% of the population owned computers.[194] The electrical and electronic market was estimated to be around $3.5 billion in 2004.[195]\n\n\nThe Saudi ICT sector has grown significantly over the last decade and is still showing strong growth. In 2012, ICT sector spending was recorded at SAR 94 billion, with 13.9% annual growth, and reached approximately SAR 102 billion in 2013, with approximately 14% annual growth.[196]\n\n\nThe e-commerce market was estimated at just over $1 billion in 2001, and grew to an estimated $7.7 billion in 2021.[197][198]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Agriculture in Saudi Arabia\n* Council of Economic and Development Affairs (Saudi Arabia)\n* Energy in Saudi Arabia\n* List of Saudi cities by GDP per capita\n* Tourism in Saudi Arabia\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Pegged to the United States dollar (USD) at 3.75 riyals per USD since 1986[1][2]\n2. **^** Data are for total population; unemployment among Saudi nationals is more than double[5]\n\n1. **^** immigrants make up 38.3% of the total population, according to UN data (2019)[5]\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Strohecker, Karin (27 April 2016). \"Saudi riyal peg pressure eases, but not gone\". *reuters.com*.

In the first quarter of 2019, Saudi Arabia's budget had its first surplus since 2016. This surplus of $10.10 billion was achieved due to an increase in oil and non-oil revenues.[20]\n\n\n\n\n## Economic overview[edit]\n\n\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980–2021 (with IMF staff estimates in 2022–2027).

oil producer. Proven reserves, according to figures provided by the Saudi government, are estimated to be 260 billion barrels (41 km3), which is about one-quarter of the world oil reserves. Petroleum in Saudi Arabia is not only plentiful but also located under pressure close to the earth's surface, which makes it less expensive and more profitable to extract compared to other places.[23] The petroleum sector accounts for roughly 87% of Saudi budget revenues, 90% of export earnings, and 42% of GDP.[24] Saudi Arabia's oil reserves and production are largely managed by the state-owned corporation Saudi Aramco.[25]\n\n\nAnother 40% of the GDP comes from the private sector. An estimated 7.5 (2013) million foreigners work legally in Saudi Arabia[26] and play a crucial role in developing the Saudi economy, for example in the oil and service sectors. The government has been encouraging the growth of the private sector for many years to decrease the kingdom's dependence on oil and to increase employment opportunities for the swelling Saudi population. In recent decades, the government started allowing private sector activity and foreign investor participation in certain sectors, such as power generation and telecommunications, and acceded to the World Trade Organization. During much of the 2000s, high oil prices[27] allowed the government to post budget surpluses and boost spending on job training and education, infrastructure development, and government salaries.\n\n\nWith its absolute monarchy, large state sector, and supply of welfare benefits, the Saudi economy has been described asː\n\n\n\n\n>  A bewildering (at least to outsiders) combination of a feudal fealty system and a more modern political patronage one. At every level in every sphere of activity, Saudis maneuver through life manipulating individual privileges, favours, obligations, and connections. By the same token, the government bureaucracy is a maze of overlapping or conflicting power centers under the patronage of various royal princes with their own priorities and agendas to pursue and dependents to satisfy.[28]\n> \n> \n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: History of the oil industry in Saudi Arabia\n\n![](image)Dammam No. 7 on March 4, 1938, the day the well struck oil in commercial quantities, becoming the first in the kingdom to do so\nSaudi Arabia was a subsistence economy until the 1930s. In 1933, the Saudi government signed an oil concession agreement with the Standard Oil Company of California;[29] five years later, commercial volumes of oil were discovered in the kingdom.[30][31] The development of oil fields continued in Saudi Arabia, managed mainly by Arabian American Oil Company (Aramco), a company formed by the partnership of Texaco and Chevron.[32] In 1951, the first offshore field in the Middle East was established by Aramco at Raʾs Al-Saffāniyyah area.[33] By 1949, Saudi oil production reached 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) and rose rapidly to 1 million bpd in 1954.[34][35] Moreover, in 1951, Aramco started operating the Trans-Arabian Pipeline that moved oil from the eastern region of Saudi Arabia to the Mediterranean Sea through Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon. However, in 1981, this line was no longer used after a new line began operations that linked Jubail on the Persian Gulf and Yanbu on the Red Sea. The new pipe contributed greatly to speed up oil transport.[33] In 1960, OPEC was established, with Saudi Arabia as one of its founding members.[36] During the 1973 oil crisis, the price of oil rose from $3 per barrel to nearly $12, and the Saudi economy started growing rapidly,[37] with GDP increasing from approximately $15 billion in 1973 to almost $184 billion by 1981.[38] After gradually purchasing Aramco assets, the Saudi government nationalized the company in 1980. In 1988, Saudi Aramco was established to take over the responsibilities of Aramco.[39]\n\n\nIn 1980, the price of oil peaked, and demand started decreasing as a result of recessions in industrialized nations and more efficient oil use, which produced surpluses.[40] This created a worldwide oil glut, with the price of oil dropping from approximately $36 per barrel in 1980 to approximately $14 by 1986.[41] Saudi oil production, which had increased to almost 10 million barrels (1,600,000 m3) per day during 1980–81, fell 80% to about 2 million barrels per day (320,000 m3/d) in 1985.[42] Budgetary deficits developed, and the government drew down its foreign assets.[43] As a result of the oil glut and the pressure from declines in production, after 1985 Saudi Arabia started enforcing production quotas more harshly for the OPEC members.[44]\n\n\nIn June 1993, Saudi Aramco absorbed the state marketing and refining company (SAMAREC), becoming the world's largest fully integrated oil company. Most Saudi oil is exported by tankers from oil terminals at Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah in the Persian Gulf. The remaining oil for export is transported via the east–west pipeline across the kingdom to the Red Sea port of Yanbu. A major new gas initiative was supposed to attract significant investments from the American and European oil companies to develop non-associated gas fields in three separate parts of Saudi Arabia. Following final technical agreements with concession awardees in December 2001, development was expected to begin in 2002.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)A map of world oil reserves according to OPEC, 2013\nIn the 1990s, Saudi Arabia experienced a significant contraction of oil revenues combined with a high rate of population growth. Per capita income fell from a high of $11,700 at the height of the oil boom in 1981 to $6,300 in 1998.[45] Taking into account the impact of the real oil price changes on the kingdom's real gross domestic income, the real command-basis GDP was computed to be 330.381 billion 1999 USD in 2010.[46] Increases in oil prices in the early 2000s helped boost per capita GDP to $17000 in 2007 dollars (about $7,400 adjusted for inflation),[47] but have declined since oil price drop in mid-2014.[48]\n\n\nHowever, beginning in late 1997, Saudi Arabia again faced the challenge of low oil prices. Because of a combination of factors—the East Asian economic crises, a warm winter in the West caused by El Niño, and an increase in non-OPEC oil production—demand for oil decreased and pulled oil prices down by more than one-third.[49]\n\n\nSaudi Arabia was a key player in coordinating the successful 1999 campaign of OPEC and other oil-producing countries to raise the oil price to its highest level since the (Persian) Gulf War by managing petroleum supply and production. That same year, Saudi Arabia established the Supreme Economic Council to formulate and better coordinate economic development policies to accelerate institutional and industrial reforms.[50]\n\n\nSaudi Arabia joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2005 after many years of negotiations.\n\n\n\n### Foreign investment[edit]\n\n\nBefore 2000, there were strict limits placed on foreign direct investment in Saudi Arabia. The 1979 Foreign Investment Act prohibited foreign ownership in some sectors of the economy, allowed foreign investment only if the investor qualified for a license based on their expertise, and gave priority to businesses that were Saudi-owned or partially Saudi-owned.[51]\n\n\nHowever, in the mid-1990s, foreign ownership rules were relaxed, with investment sought in telecommunications, utilities, and financial services.[52] The 2000 Foreign Direct Investment Act made substantial changes to the rules on foreign investment, including allowing projects to be run by 100% foreign-owned companies for the first time.[51]\n\n\nSince 2008, extensive Saudi land investment has taken place, especially in Africa. For more, see the section on the Non-petroleum sector.\n\n\nAccording to UNCTAD's June 2018 report, Saudi Arabia's foreign direct investment was only $1.4 billion in 2017, down from $7.5 billion the year before and as much as $12.2 billion in 2012. The fall in investment is attributed to negative intra-company loans by foreign multinationals and various divestments.[53] In the first quarter of 2018, net capital outflows were running at approximately 5% of GDP, compared to less than 2% of GDP in late 2016.[54] However, according to a report published in Trading Economics, in the second quarter of 2018, foreign direct investment in the country raised by $882 million.[55] Moreover, SAGIA's data indicate that licenses provided to foreign investment increased by 130% in the first quarter of 2018 as a result of reforms in the economy.[56]\n\n\nAs Saudi oil income declined in the late 2010s, the kingdom's international debt soared. In December 2018, Saudi Arabia announced it would be issuing bonds worth approximately 120 billion riyals ($32 billion) to cover its 4.2% GDP deficit of 131 billion riyals.[57] In January 2019, the kingdom sold bonds worth $7.5 billion.[58] In almost two and a half years, bonds worth $60 billion were sold by Saudi, which became one of the biggest borrowers globally.[59]\n\n\nIn September 2018, the Public Investment Fund completed a deal with a group of global lenders for a loan of $11 billion.[60] The deal raised more than initially planned and was the first time the PIF had incorporated loans and debt instruments into its funding.[61] According to data from Fitch Ratings, over two years starting from May 2016 Saudi Arabia went from having zero debt to raising $68 billion in dollar-denominated bonds and syndicated loans—one of the fastest rates among emerging economies.[62]\n\n\nForeign investments in the kingdom witnessed a rapid increase in the first quarter of 2019. The number of new licenses approved for foreign businesses grew 70% over 2018. Most licenses were approved for British and Chinese companies, which drove the increase.[63] In the first quarter of 2019, foreign investment in Saudi Arabia jumped by 28%.[20]\n\n\n\n### Diversification and the development plans[edit]\n\n\nThe government has sought to allocate its petroleum income to transform its relatively undeveloped, oil-based economy into a modern industrial state, while maintaining the kingdom's traditional Islamic values and customs. Although economic planners have not achieved all their goals, the economy has progressed rapidly. Oil wealth has increased the standard of living of most Saudis. However, significant population growth has strained the government's ability to finance further improvements in the country's standard of living. Heavy dependence on petroleum revenue continues, but industry and agriculture now account for a larger share of economic activity. The mismatch between the job skills of Saudi graduates and the needs of the private job market at all levels remains the principal obstacle to economic diversification and development; about 4.6 million non-Saudis are employed in the economy.[64]\n\n\nSaudi Arabia first began to diversify its economy to reduce dependency on oil in the 1970s as part of its first five-year development plan. Basic petrochemical industries using petroleum byproducts as feedstock were developed.[65] The fishing villages of al-Jubail on the Persian Gulf and Yanbu on the Red Sea were developed. However, their effect on Saudi Arabia's economic fortunes has been small.[66]\n\n\nSaudi Arabia's first two development plans, covering the 1970s, emphasized infrastructure. The results were impressive—the total length of paved highways tripled, power generation increased by a factor of 28, and the capacity of the seaports grew by a factor of 10. For the third plan (1980–85), the emphasis changed. Spending on infrastructure declined, shifting instead to education, health, and social services. The share for diversifying and expanding productive sectors of the economy (primary industry) did not rise as planned, but the two industrial cities of Jubail and Yanbu—which were built around the use of the country's oil and gas to produce steel, petrochemicals, fertilizer, and refined oil products—were largely completed.[64]\n\n\nIn the fourth plan (1985–90), the country's basic infrastructure was viewed as largely complete, but education and training remained areas of concern. Private enterprise was encouraged, and foreign investment in the form of joint ventures with Saudi public and private companies was welcomed. The private sector became more important, rising to 70% of non-oil GDP by 1987. While still concentrated in trade and commerce, private investment increased in industry, agriculture, banking, and construction companies. These private investments were supported by generous government financing and incentive programs. The objective was for the private sector to have 70% to 90% ownership in most joint venture enterprises.[64]\n\n\nThe fifth plan (1990–95) emphasized consolidation of the country's defences; improved and more efficient government social services; regional development; and, most importantly, creating greater private-sector employment opportunities for Saudis by reducing the number of foreign workers.[64]\n\n\nThe sixth plan (1996–2000) focused on lowering the cost of government services without cutting them and sought to expand educational training programs. The plan called for reducing the kingdom's dependence on the petroleum sector by diversifying economic activity, particularly in the private sector, with special emphasis on industry and agriculture. It also continued the effort to \"Saudize\" the labour force.[64]\n\n\nThe seventh plan (2000–2004) focused more on economic diversification and a greater role of the private sector in the Saudi economy. For 2000–04, the government aimed at an average GDP growth rate of 3.16% each year, with projected growths of 5.04% for the private sector and 4.01% for the non-oil sector. The government also set a target of creating 817,300 new jobs for Saudi nationals.[64] By 2007, advertising expenditures had reached new peaks due to emphasis on value-added manufacturing.[67][*failed verification*]\n\n\nIn 2016, the main investing countries in Saudi Arabia were the US, UAE, France, Singapore, Kuwait, and Malaysia. They mainly invested in chemical industry, real estate, tourism, fossil fuels, automobiles, and machinery.[68] As part of its diversification, Saudi Arabia arranged major refinery contracts with Chinese and other companies.[69]\n\n\nAfter Saudi Arabia became a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2005, the overall foreign investment environment in Saudi Arabia improved thanks to the kingdom's stable economy, massive oil reserves, high power of expenditure, developed infrastructure, reinforced finance, and banking system. Since then, and pursuant to its commitment to the WTO, Saudi Arabia has been developing trade-related policies and legislations. Moreover, foreign investment has been highly encouraged by Saudi Vision 2030 and its economic diversification.[68]\n\n\nSince 2017, to boost the economy and decrease the country's dependency on oil, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has introduced multiple changes, such as raising the prices of gasoline and electricity, levying new taxes, and prioritizing Saudi workers over foreign workers. However, some government officials claimed the policies were causing serious ill effects on the economy. Saudi businessmen reported a decline in sales for 2018, and a few blamed the government.[70]\n\n\nIn 2019, the *Financial Times* reported that the plans to float state-owned oil beneficiary Saudi Aramco were stranded between the company's attachment to the oil ministry and the desire to meet international standards. However, Energy Minister Khalid Al Falih has long maintained that Aramco's association with the state is a \"win-win policy\" for both parties.[71]\n\n\n\n### Future[edit]\n\n\nSaudi Arabia has announced plans to invest about $47 billion in three of the world's largest and most ambitious petrochemical projects. These include the $27 billion Ras Tanura integrated refinery and petrochemical project, the $9 billion Saudi Kayan[72] petrochemical complex at Jubail Industrial City, and the $10 billion Petro Rabigh refinery upgrade project. Together, the three projects will employ more than 150,000 technicians and engineers.[73] Upon completion in 2015–16, the Ras Tanura project would become the world's largest petrochemical facility of its kind with a combined production capacity of 11 million tons per year of different petrochemical and chemical products.[*needs update?*] The products will include ethylene, propylene, aromatics, polyethylene, ethylene oxide, chlorine derivatives, and glycol.[73]\n\n\nSaudi Arabia made plans to launch six \"economic cities\" (e.g., King Abdullah Economic City) in an effort to diversify the economy and provide jobs.[74] At a total construction cost of $60 billion (2013), they were \"expected to contribute $150bn to the economy\".[75]\n[76] However, these cities have failed to attract either the population or the financial investment that the government claimed they would.[77]\n\n\nThe privatization program Saudi Vision 2030 is running behind schedule. Oil prices have doubled since the government began to consider the program in 2015. Delay in Aramco's initial public offering further demonstrated a lack of urgency to privatize, even though in July 2018, the International Monetary Fund urged accelerating the process.[78]\n\n\nAs Vision 2030 has been recently adopted by the Saudi government, several reforms[*which?*] have been undertaken, including in business environments and the financial sector. Moreover, the government has been seeking to achieve greater transparency by issuing a draft law regarding the involvement of the private sector. Other reforms have been passed to increase manpower in the private sector.[79]\n\n\nAccording to many reports, the Saudi government is interested in granting more liberties to the foreign investment system and giving a 100% allowance to foreign investors to work in the wholesale and retail sector in certain cases.[68]\n\n\nThe Saudi Ministry of Commerce and Investment expected that the kingdom would see an increase in the GDP per capita from US$20,700 to $33,500 by 2020.[80] However, the GDP per capita by 2020 had stagnated at $US20,000.[81]\n\n\n\n## Employment[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Saudization and Foreign workers in Saudi Arabia\n\nAs of 2008, roughly two-thirds of workers employed in Saudi Arabia were foreigners, and in the private sector the proportion was approximately 90%.[82] In January 2014, the Saudi government claimed it had lowered the 90% rate, doubling the number of Saudi citizens working in the private sector to 1.5 million (compared to 10 million foreign expatriates working in the kingdom).[83]\n\n\nAccording to Reuters, economists \"estimate only 30–40 percent of working-age Saudis hold jobs or actively seek work\", although the official unemployment rate is only around 12 percent. Most Saudis with jobs are employed by the government, but the International Monetary Fund has warned that the government cannot support such a large payroll in the long term.[83][84] The government has announced a succession of plans since 2000 to deal with the imbalance by \"Saudization\" of the economy, but the foreign workforce and unemployment has continued to grow.[85] Since the beginning of 2017, however, Saudi Arabia has seen record numbers of foreign workers leaving the country as the Saudi government imposed higher fees on expatriate workers, with more than 677,000 foreigners leaving the kingdom. This has done little to lower the unemployment rate, which rose to 12.9 percent, the highest on record.[86]\n\n\nEach year, about a quarter-million young Saudis enter the job market. With the first phase of Saudization into effect, 70% of sales jobs are expected to be filled by Saudis. However, the private sector still remains hugely dominated by foreigners. The rate of local unemployment is 12.9%, its highest in more than a decade.[87] According to a report published by Bloomberg Economics in 2018, the government needs to produce 700000 jobs by 2020 to meet its 9% unemployment target.[87]\n\n\nOne obstacle is social resistance to certain types of employment. Jobs in service and sales are considered totally unacceptable for citizens of Saudi Arabia—both to potential employees and customers.[88]\n\n\n\n## Non-petroleum resources sector[edit]\n\n\nSaudi Arabia has natural resources other than oil, including small mineral deposits of gold, silver, iron, copper, zinc, manganese, tungsten, lead, sulfur, phosphate, soapstone, and feldspar.[66] The country has a small agricultural sector, primarily in the southwest where annual rainfall averages 400 mm (16 in). The country is one of the world's largest producers of dates. Prior to 2009, wheat was grown using desalinated water for irrigation,[66] but was phased out by 2016 due to costly water usage.[89] As of 2009, the livestock population amounted to 7.4 million sheep, 4.2 million goats, half a million camels, and a quarter of a million cattle.[66]\n\n\nAlthough the jobs created by the roughly two million annual Hajj pilgrims do not last long, they employ more people than the oil industry—40,000 temporary jobs (butchers, barbers, coach drivers, etc.)—and generates US$2–3 billion in revenue.[90]\n\n\nIn 2008, the \"Initiative for Saudi Agricultural Investment Abroad\" was launched, leading to extensive billion-dollar purchases of large tracts of land around the world, including in Ethiopia, Indonesia, Mali, Senegal, and Sudan. Described as land-grabbing by critics, in various instances these purchases have also led to uproars in the respective countries. Competing industrializing nations with food security problems seeking agricultural land include China, South Korea, and India, as well as the Persian Gulf States of Kuwait, Qatar, and the UAE.[91][92][93][94][95]\n\n\nIn 2016, Mohammad bin Salman announced Saudi Vision 2030, a plan to reduce Saudi Arabia's dependence on oil, diversify its economy, and develop public service sectors such as health, education, infrastructure, recreation, and tourism.\n\n\n\n## Real estate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Residential homes in Yanbu\nOne of the fastest growing sectors in the country is real estate, supported by the introduction of real estate investment trusts (REITs). Despite significant growth in the number of REITs,[96][97] the sector has yet to achieve its full potential due to shortages in both residential and commercial real estate. A number of regional experts[*who?*] believe that most issues will be resolved as the market becomes more mature.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nReal estate plays a fundamental role in the country's non-oil economy. In 2016, the value of real estate transactions including sales of existing units amounted to $74.91 billion from 15 October to 16 September.[98] This is a major drop compared to the number of transactions recorded a decade earlier, which reached $239.93 billion. The real estate sector has been driven recently by strong local demand fundamentals and only a small amount of speculation.\n\n\nOwnership of land property in Saudi Arabia is generally restricted to Saudis, but this is subject to certain qualifications. For example, Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) nationals and GCC companies have certain rights to own land, subject to a number of restrictions.[99] Foreigners (being non-GCC nationals) are entitled to ownership and investment in real estate with some conditions. A foreign company needs to have a foreign investment license from the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority (SAGIA) and the owned real estate must be related to a particular investment project for property development.[100] A foreign individual needs to have normal legal residency status and a permit from the Ministry of the Interior to own land or property.[100]\n\n\nThe major expansion in this sector attracted the top real estate consultancies—such as Jones Lang LaSalle,[101] Knight Frank,[102] and Cluttons[103]—who have now opened offices in the country. Beyond this, demand for professional real estate services is attracting regional educators such as DREI to provide courses on Saudi real estate, and even dedicated books focused on the market, such as *Saudi Real Estate Companion*.\n\n\nReal estate plays an important role in the Saudi Vision 2030, which maps out significant commitments by the Saudi government relating to housing and the development of land for a variety of uses. In particular, Vision 2030 states: \"Where it exists in strategic locations, we will also capitalize on the government's reserves of real estate. We will allocate prime areas within cities for educational institutions, retail, and entertainment centers, large areas along our coasts will be dedicated to tourist projects and appropriate lands will be allocated for industrial projects.\"[104]\n\n\nIn 2016, new rules were introduced by the Capital Market Authority to form REITs. This aimed at opening the real estate market to a wide range of investors.[99][97] The REITs consist of units representing the ownership of the underlying real estate. These units are offered to the public and traded on the Saudi Stock Exchange.[99][105]\n\n\nThe introduction of REITs was a part of the National Transformation program, one of Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 programs, and has targets of:\n\n\n\n* Increasing the real estate sector contribution from GDP of five percent to 10 percent annually.[99]\n* Supporting the construction of 1.5 million homes by providing the required private capital.[99]\n* Establishing partnerships with private sector developers to develop government land for housing projects.\n* Establishing fast-track licenses and special finance packages to encourage private sector investment in housing projects.\n\n\nIn 2019, the Saudi government introduced the Premium Residency scheme, which allows wealthy investors of any nationality to purchase residency and buy and sell real estate.[106]\n\n\n\n## Automotive[edit]\n\n\n![](image)KSU Gazal-1\nIn 2010, the KSU Gazal-1, an SUV built by students at King Saud University, became the first mass-produced vehicle manufactured domestically in Saudi Arabia.[107]\n\n\nIn 2022, the US car company Lucid Motors announced plans to build an electric vehicle manufacturing plant in Jeddah.[108] Construction began in May 2022, and the plant will have capacity for 150,000 vehicles.[109]\n\n\nToyota is the leading brand in Saudi Arabia, accounting for 30% of car sales in the country; they are followed by Kia and Hyundai who together make up 26%, and Renault/Nissan/Mitsubishi at 9%. The American Big Three auto makers (Ford, GM, and Chrysler) comprise the remainder.[110] As for the quantity of vehicle units sold, in the first half of 2023, Toyota had the highest in the country with 112,584 and the second-most was the Hyundai badge with 47,218.[111]\n\n\n\n## Private sector[edit]\n\n\nSaudi Arabia's private sector is dominated by a handful of big businesses in the service sector, primarily in construction and real estate, such as Olayan, Zamil, Almarai, Mobily, STC, SABIC, Sadara, Halliburton, Baker Hughes, Flynas, Hilton, Zain, Yanbu Cement, Alhokair, MBC, Mahfouz, Al Rajhi, and Alfanar. These firms are \"heavily dependent on government spending\", which is dependent on oil revenues.[112]\n\n\nFrom 2003 to 2013, \"several key services\" were privatized—municipal water supply, electricity, telecommunications—and parts of education and health care, traffic control, and car accident reporting were also privatized. According to Arab News columnist Abdel Aziz Aluwaisheg, \"in almost every one of these areas, consumers have raised serious concerns about the performance of these privatized entities.\"[113]\n\n\nA relatively small sector until a boom in the 1980s,[114] the food service industry in Saudi Arabia today is valued at around $13 billion.[115]\n\n\nTo provide the best support for the private sector and entrepreneurs, the kingdom announced a decision approved by the Saudi Cabinet in July 2019 allowing businesses in the country to be given the option to remain open 24 hours a day.[116] As of 2023, the average monthly salary for Saudis working in the private sector is SR9600, up 45% from SR6600 in the year 2018.[117]\n\n\n\n## Trade[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Saudi Arabian exports in 2006\nIn April 2000, the government established the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority to encourage foreign direct investment in Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia maintains a negative list of sectors in which foreign investment is prohibited, but the government planned to open some closed sectors such as telecommunications, insurance, and power transmission/distribution over time.[118]\n\n\nSaudi Arabia became a full World Trade Organization (WTO) member on 11 December 2005.[119] In 2019, the government established the General Authority for Foreign Trade to enhance the kingdom's international commercial and investment activities.[120]\n\n\nIn early July 2020, Saudi Arabia announced the nomination of its former Minister of Economy and Saudi royal court adviser, Mohammad Al-Tuwaijri, for the role of WTO's director-general.[121] The nominations were made public about a month after the WTO reported the kingdom for copyrights infringement following distribution of pirated sports broadcasting content on the state-owned broadcast service, BeoutQ.[122] The nomination of al-Tuwaijri received criticism from human rights groups in mid-August 2020, demanding the rejection of the Saudi nominee due to the kingdom's violation of human rights in addition to his silence over it.[123] On 7 October 2020, Al-Tuwaijri, along with other nominees from the UK and Kenya, lost the bid for the role due to lack of support, as compared to the nominees from Nigeria and South Korea who qualified for the final round of selection.[124]\n\n\nSaudi Arabia is part of the following trade organizations:\n\n\n\n* World Trade Organization (WTO)[119]\n* International Monetary Fund (IMF)[125]\n* International Chamber of Commerce (ICC)[126]\n* International Organization for Standardization (ISO)[127]\n* World Customs Organization (WCO)[128]\n\n\n## Challenges[edit]\n\n\nAmong the challenges to the Saudi economy include halting or reversing the decline in per capita income, improving education to prepare youth for the workforce and providing them with employment, diversifying the economy, stimulating the private sector and housing construction, and diminishing corruption and inequality. In answer to the question of why the Saudi economy is so dependent on foreign labor, the UN Arab Human Development Report blamed stunted social and economic development inhibited by lack of personal freedom, poor education, government hiring based on factors other than merit, and the exclusion of women.[129]\n\n\n\n### Income drop[edit]\n\n\nDespite possessing the second largest petroleum reserves in the world, per capita income dropped from approximately $18,000 at the height of the oil boom (1981) to $7,000 in 2001, according to one estimate.[130] As of 2013, due to the rapid population growth of Saudi Arabia,[131] per capita income in Saudi was \"a fraction of that of smaller Persian gulf neighbors\", even less than petroleum-poor Bahrain.[132]\n\n\nUnlike most developed countries, where GDP growth is a function of increases in productivity and inputs such as employment, in Saudi Arabia the fluctuation of oil prices is the most important factor in the growth or decline of domestic production. \"Saudi reserves are steadily being depleted, and no significant new discoveries have been found to replace them,\" according to Middle East journalist Karen House.[*as of?*] Saudi population grew sevenfold from 1960 to 2010,[133] and petrol prices are subsidized and cost users less than equivalent quantities of bottled water.[134] With production stagnant, growth in population and domestic energy consumption means a decline in per capita income unless oil prices rise to match that growth.[132]\n\n\n\n### Demographics[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Demographics of Saudi Arabia\n\nThe Saudi population is young. About 51% of the total population are under the age of 25 (as of February 2012).[135] According to a 2013 report by the International Monetary Fund, up to 1.6 million young nationals of the Persian Gulf countries (of which Saudi Arabia is the largest) will enter the workforce from 2013 to 2018, but the economies of those countries will have jobs in the private sector for less than half (approximately 600,000).[136]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Education in Saudi Arabia\n\nAccording to *The Economist*, the Saudi government has attempted in past years to raise employment by forcing \"companies to fill at least 30% of their positions\" with Saudi citizens. However, \"employers complained bitterly about the lack of skills among young locals; years of rote-learning and religious instruction fail to prepare them for the job market.\" However, many argue that young Saudis couldn't compete with foreigners due to the low compensation and salaries most companies had used to offer for employees from Asian, Indian subcontinent, and other Arab poor countries, which this cheap labor happily accepts; in addition to the bad work conditions, culture, and environment present in most of the Saudi private sector, largely due to the fact that it was initially modeled to accommodate very-low-income employees from other nations, not the Saudi medium-income and somewhat highly educated population. As a consequence, \"the quota has now been dropped and replaced with a more flexible system\".[137]\n\n\nAccording to scholar David Commins, the kingdom depends \"on huge numbers of expatriate workers to fill technical and administrative positions\" in part because of an educational system that, despite \"generous budgets\", has suffered from \"poorly trained teachers, low retention rates, lack of rigorous standards, weak scientific and technical instruction and excessive attention to religious subjects\".[138][139][140]\n\n\nA 2015 survey conducted by Bayt.com showed that over a quarter (28%) of professionals in North Africa and the Middle East believe that there is a skills shortage in their country of residence. This belief was even more prominent among respondents in Saudi Arabia (39%).[141]\n\n\n\n### Innovation[edit]\n\n\nSaudi has not been a hotbed of technological innovation. The number of Saudi patents registered in the United States between 1977 and 2010 came to 382—less than twelve per year—compared to 84,840 patents for South Korea or 20,620 for Israel during that period.[142][143] However, in 2017 Saudi Arabia was granted 664 patents by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, ranking 23rd among 92 countries.[144][145] The number of granted patents was double that of all Arab countries combined during the same period.[146] Saudi Arabia hopes to increase technological innovation, particularly with the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, and thus to stimulate the economy.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Bureaucracy[edit]\n\n\nBusiness journalist Karen House criticized the Saudi bureaucracy, explaining that someone seeking to start a business in Saudi Arabia:\n\n\n\n\n> has to complete innumerable applications and documents at multiple layers of multiple ministries, which invariably requires seeking favours from various patronage networks and accumulating obligations along the way, most probably including having to hire less-than-competent dependents of his patrons. Then, for any business of any size, government contracts, not private competition, are the financial lifeblood. So this means more patrons, more favours, and more obligations. Not surprisingly, Saudi businesses that can compete outside the protected Saudi market are few.[147]\n> \n> \n\n\n### Corruption[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Corruption in Saudi Arabia\n\nThe cost of maintaining the Royal Family is estimated by some to be about US$10 billion per year.[66]\n\n\nA 2005 survey by the Riyadh Chamber of Commerce found that 77% of businessmen polled felt they had to 'bypass' the law to conduct their operations. By 2012, \"businessmen say it has only gotten worse\".[148]\n\n\nSaudi Arabia has been severely criticized for failing to tackle money laundering and international terrorism financing. A report released by the Financial Action Task Force on 24 September 2018, says, \"Saudi Arabia is not effectively investigating and prosecuting individuals involved in larger scale or professional [money laundering] activity\" and is \"not effectively confiscating the proceeds of crime\".[149]\n\n\n\n### Poverty[edit]\n\n\nEstimates of the number of Saudis below the poverty line range from between 12.7%[150] and 25%.[151] Press reports and private estimates as of 2013 \"suggest that between 2 million and 4 million\" of the country's native Saudis live on \"less than about $530 a month\" – about $17 a day – considered the poverty line in Saudi Arabia.[151][152]\n\n\nThe Saudi state discourages calling attention to or complaining about poverty. In December 2011, days after the Arab Spring uprisings, the Saudi interior ministry detained reporter Feros Boqna and two colleagues (Hussam al-Drewesh and Khaled al-Rasheed) and held them for almost two weeks for questioning after they uploaded a 10-minute video on the topic (*Mal3ob 3alena*, or 'We are being cheated') to YouTube.[153][154] Authors of the video claim that 22% of Saudis are considered to be poor (2009) and 70% of Saudis do not own their houses.[155] \nStatistics on the issue are not available through the UN resources because the Saudi government does not issue poverty figures.[156] Observers researching the issue prefer to stay anonymous[157] because of the risk of being arrested, like Feras Boqna.[154][158]\n\n\n\n### Housing[edit]\n\n\n50% of Saudi Arabia's citizens owned their own home in 2017, a rise from 30% in 2011 but below the international average rate of 70%.[159] In 2011, analysts estimated 500,000 new homes per year were needed to match the growth in Saudi population, but as of early 2014 only 300,000 to 400,000 houses per year were being built.[160]\n\n\nOne problem is that the government Real Estate Development Fund (REDF)—which provides 81% of all loans for housing—had an 18-year waiting list for loans due to pent-up demand. Another is that the REDF's maximum loan is 500,000 SR ($133,000), while in 2012 the average price for a small free-standing home in Riyadh is more than double that—1.23 million SR ($328,000).[161] However, as part of the economic reforms undertaken by the government to enhance national living standards, new funding solutions have been established to boost the mortgages for existing and new borrowers to help finance their housing plans. This was announced in August 2018 by the Minister of Housing, Mr. Majed Al-Hogail.[162]\n\n\nA major reason for the high cost of housing is the high cost of land. In urban areas, the price of land has been bid up because nearly all of it is owned by the Saudi elite (members of the royal family or other wealthy Saudis), who have lobbied the government for land \"giveaways\".[160] Landlords have seen prices rocket by 50% from 2011 to 2013.[160] The owners benefit from these price increases as they hold the land for future development.[163][164] To deal with the key \"land banking\" issue, the Minister of Housing suggested in 2013 that vacant property within city limits could be subject to a tax. However, no firm plans for any tax have been unveiled.[160]\n\n\n\n### Further diversification[edit]\n\n\nAccording to journalist Karen House, \"every\" Saudi five-year plan \"since the first one in 1970\" has called for diversifying the economy beyond oil, but with marginal success.[165]\n\n\nAs of 2007, manufacturing outside of the petroleum industry contributed 10% to Saudi Arabian GDP and less than 6% of total employment.[166]\n\n\n\n### Private sector growth[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, the imposition of a 5% value-added tax (VAT) brought private-sector growth to a halt. Consumer spending was also restrained after a sharp increase in prices for energy, electricity, and water earlier in 2018. The kingdom witnessed a mass departure of around 750,000 foreign workers after imposing new government levies on ex-pat workers. The government is also forcing small-business owners to hire Saudi nationals at comparatively higher wages than foreign workers. Gaining money from large, direct foreign investments is also not working in favor of the government. Rich Saudis are reluctant to invest within the kingdom due to the fear of triggering government scrutiny.[167]\n\n\nOn 11 May 2020, the government announced that it would triple the kingdom's VAT on goods and services, raising it from 5% to 15%.[168] It also stated that the increase in VAT—introduced due to the country's current financial crisis due to plummeting oil prices and impact of coronavirus—would also be followed by a cut in monthly allowance for state workers worth approximately $266, and financial benefits for contractors.[169] \nAramco decreased the production of its Arab Light grade of crude oil by a significant amount[*by how much?*] to be shipped to Asia. The firm also cut down oil pricing for its US buyers following wavering demand for fuel due to the global relapse of the coronavirus pandemic.[170]\n\n\nAccording to the General Authority for Statistics, Saudi Arabia's inflation accelerated to 6.2% in August 2020, as compared to the same month last year. The report states that the annual inflation rate increased from only 0.5% (in June) to 6.1% (in July), before the increase of VAT to 15% from 5% was introduced, effective from 1 July 2020.[171]\n\n\n\n## Investment[edit]\n\n\nSaudi Arabia has two stock exchanges, the Tadawul and The Saudi Parallel Market (Nomu), whose financial markets are regulated by the Capital Market Authority.[172][173] The stock market capitalization of listed companies in Saudi Arabia is valued at $2.22 trillion. According to the International Institute for Management Development, Saudi Arabia experienced the largest improvement in business competitiveness of all countries in 2019; the kingdom rose 13 places to 26th in the world.[174]\n\n\n\n### Doing business[edit]\n\n\nSaudi Arabia is among the countries with the most notable improvement in doing business, according to the World Bank Group's \"Doing Business\" 2020 report. The country jumped 30 places to rank 62nd in ease of doing business, compared to the previous year.[175][176][177] Previously, the kingdom had been declining in the overall rankings, from 22nd in 2013[178] to 92nd in 2018.[179]\n\n\nAccording to the World Bank in 2019, Saudi Arabia had conducted reforms in eight areas of business: (1) starting a business, (2) getting construction permits, (3) getting electricity, (4) getting credit, (5) protecting minority investors, (6) trading across borders, (7) enforcing contracts, and (8) resolving insolvency.[176]\n\n\nSaudi Arabian companies dominate 2009's \"MEED 100\", with companies listed on the Tadawul accounting for 29 out of the region's 100 biggest publicly quoted companies ranked by market capitalization. Just three of the 20 companies that have dropped out of the top 100 over the past year are listed on the Saudi stock exchange.[180]\n\n\nForeigners are allowed to wholly own limited liability companies in the majority of industries. Non-Saudi nationals are required to obtain a foreign capital investment license from the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority.[181]\n\n\nWith a total of 291 foreign investor licenses issued in the second quarter of 2019, the kingdom has witnessed an increase in international investment, reflecting the economic reforms under the Saudi Vision 2030. Obtaining a foreign investor license became more straightforward as it requires only two documents, and it is processed in three hours.[182]\n\n\n\n### Controversies[edit]\n\n\nSharmarke Gaani, a Somali businessman, travelled to Saudi Arabia on 25 January 2021 to spread his home-health business in the country, which he had visited twice since 2017. On his arrival, the New Albany businessman faced 3-day detention for no discernible reason. According to his statements, the detention facility was cramped, cold, and didn't offer masks despite housing eight other inmates during the COVID-19 pandemic. Gaani claimed that he suffered \"mentally, physically and emotionally\" and just wanted \"justice\". His call to the United States consulate in the country went unanswered. On the third day of his detention, Gaani was informed that he could leave, without receiving any explanation or apology for the incident.[183]\n\n\n\n### Companies[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of largest companies of Saudi Arabia and List of companies of Saudi Arabia\n\n#### Saudi Aramco[edit]\n\n\nSaudi Aramco (officially the Saudi Arabian Oil Co.) is Saudi Arabia's national oil, petroleum, and natural gas company headquartered in Dhahran.[184][185][186] Saudi Aramco was listed for public trading on 10 December 2019 and had a valuation as of US$2 trillion as of 12 December 2019.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nSaudi Aramco has both the second largest proven crude oil reserves, which it claims to be more than 260 billion barrels (4.1×1010 m3), and the largest daily oil production.[187] The company operates the world's largest single hydrocarbon network, the Master Gas System. Its yearly production is 3.479 billion barrels (553,100,000 m3),[188] and it manages over 100 oil and gas fields in Saudi Arabia, including 284.8 trillion standard cubic feet (scf) of natural gas reserves.[188] Saudi Aramco owns the Ghawar Field, the world's largest oil field, and the Shaybah Field, another one of the world's largest oil fields.[189]\n\n\nOn 16 November 2020, Saudi Aramco announced hiring banks to sell dollar-denominated bonds with the aim of improving finances after the coronavirus pandemic caused a sharp fall in the global demand for crude oil. Aramco's multi-tranche offer was set to run between 3 and 50 years, depending on the market conditions. The banks hired for the transaction included Citi Bank, Goldman Sachs International, HSBC, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and NCB Capital.[190] Other banks involved in the deal included BNP Paribas, BOC International, BofA Securities, Credit Agricole, First Abu Dhabi Bank, Mizuho, MUFG, SMBC Nikko and Societe Generale.[191]\n\n\nIn 2021, Saudi Aramco made a net-income of 95.5 billion riyals ($25.5 billion) in the second quarter alone, which was the highest level since 2018.[192]\n\n\n\n#### SABIC[edit]\n\n\nThe Saudi Arabian Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC was established by a royal decree in 1976 to produce chemicals, polymers, and fertilizers. In 2008, SABIC was Asia's largest (in terms of market capitalization) and most profitable publicly listed non-oil company, the world's fourth-largest petrochemical company, the second-largest producer of ethylene glycol and methanol in the world, the third-largest producer of polyethylene and overall the fourth-largest producer of polypropylene and polyolefin. It ranked 186th as the world's largest corporation on the Fortune Global 500 for 2009. Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings claimed SABIC to be the world's largest producer of polymers and the Persian Gulf region's largest steel producer for 2005 and assigned SABIC an \"A\" corporate credit rating. In 2008, Fortune 500 ranking records SABIC revenues at $40.2 billion, profits at $5.8 billion, and assets standing at $72.4 billion.[193]\n\n\n\n#### Ma'aden (company)[edit]\n\n\nMa'aden was formed as a Saudi joint stock company on 23 March 1997 for the purpose of facilitating the development of Saudi Arabia's mineral resources. Ma'aden's activities have focused on its active gold business which has grown in recent years to include the operation of five gold mines: Mahd Ad Dahab, Al Hajar, Sukhaybarat, Bulghah, and Al Amar. Ma'aden is now expanding its activities beyond its gold business with the development of phosphates, aluminium, and other projects. In addition, since its formation, Ma'aden (through the Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources) has collaborated with the government and local legislators to develop a regulatory framework for the governance of the mining industry.\n\n\n\n#### ICT Services[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article needs to be **updated**.

The number of PCs per capita grew from 13% of the population owning a computer in 2002 to nearly 43% in 2005, leapfrogging the rest of West Asia. By 2018, 50.57% of the population owned computers.[194] The electrical and electronic market was estimated to be around $3.5 billion in 2004.[195]\n\n\nThe Saudi ICT sector has grown significantly over the last decade and is still showing strong growth. In 2012, ICT sector spending was recorded at SAR 94 billion, with 13.9% annual growth, and reached approximately SAR 102 billion in 2013, with approximately 14% annual growth.[196]\n\n\nThe e-commerce market was estimated at just over $1 billion in 2001, and grew to an estimated $7.7 billion in 2021.[197][198]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Agriculture in Saudi Arabia\n* Council of Economic and Development Affairs (Saudi Arabia)\n* Energy in Saudi Arabia\n* List of Saudi cities by GDP per capita\n* Tourism in Saudi Arabia\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Pegged to the United States dollar (USD) at 3.75 riyals per USD since 1986[1][2]\n2. **^** Data are for total population; unemployment among Saudi nationals is more than double[5]\n\n1. **^** immigrants make up 38.3% of the total population, according to UN data (2019)[5]\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Strohecker, Karin (27 April 2016). \"Saudi riyal peg pressure eases, but not gone\". *reuters.com*.

The previous plan called for slashing unemployment to 2.8% only to see it rise to 10.5% in 2009, the end of that plan period. Government plans in Saudi are like those in the old Soviet Union, grandiose but unmet.
