Besides the *Star Wars* and *Superman* franchises, *James Bond* and *Godzilla* films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then *Gone with the Wind*\u2014which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years\u2014is still the highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n## Highest-grossing films[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHighest-grossing films as of 2022[update] adjusted for inflation[35][Inf]\n| Rank\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross(2022 $)\n | Year\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | *Gone with the Wind* | $4,192,000,000\n | 1939\n |\n| 2\n | *Avatar* | A1$3,824,000,000\n | 2009\n |\n| 3\n | *Titanic* | $2,516,000,000T$3,485,000,000\n | 1997\n |\n| 4\n | *Star Wars* | $3,443,000,000\n | 1977\n |\n| 5\n | *Avengers: Endgame* | AE$3,165,000,000\n | 2019\n |\n| 6\n | *The Sound of Music* | $2,884,000,000\n | 1965\n |\n| 7\n | *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* | $2,815,000,000\n | 1982\n |\n| 8\n | *The Ten Commandments* | $2,665,000,000\n | 1956\n |\n| 9\n | *Doctor Zhivago* | $2,526,000,000\n | 1965\n |\n| 10\n | *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* | TFA$2,491,000,000\n | 2015\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDespite the inherent difficulties in accounting for inflation, several attempts have been made.

The figures in the above chart take into account inflation that occurred in 2014, and in every available year since then, through 2022.\n\n\nA1The adjusted gross for *Avatar* includes revenue from the original release and all four reissues. The original release and 2010 Special Edition grosses are adjusted from the Guinness base year, whilst the 2020 and 2021 grosses are adjusted from the 2021 index and the 2022 gross from 2022.[37]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Gone with the Wind* is likewise represented twice on the chart: the 1940 entry includes earnings from its staggered 1939\u20131942 release (roadshow/\u200bgeneral release/\u200bsecond-run)[86] along with all of its revenue up to the 1961 reissue prior to losing the record to *The Sound of Music* in 1966; its 1971 entry\u2014after it took back the record\u2014includes income from the 1967 and 1971 reissues but omitting later releases. *The Godfather* was re-released in 1973 after its success at the 45th Academy Awards, and *Jaws* was released again in 1976, and their grosses here most likely include earnings from those releases. *The Sound of Music*, *The Godfather*, *Jaws*, *Jurassic Park*, and *Titanic* increased their earnings with further releases in 1973, 1997, 1979, 2013, and 2012, respectively, but they are not included in the totals here because they had already conceded the record prior to being re-released.\n\n\n\n\n\nTimeline of the highest-grossing film record\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSteven Spielberg is the most represented director on the chart, with six films to his credit, occupying the top spot in 1975, 1981, 1982, 1984, 1989 and 1993. Cecil B. DeMille (1932, 1947, 1949, 1952 and 1956) is in second place with five films and William Wyler (1942, 1946, 1959 and 1968) and James Cameron (1991, 1997, 2009 and 2022) are tied for third place with four films. D. W. Griffith (1915, 1916 and 1920), George Roy Hill (1966, 1969 and 1973) and the Russo brothers (2016, 2018 and 2019) all feature heavily with three films apiece. George Lucas directed two chart-toppers in 1977 and 1999, but also served in a strong creative capacity as a producer and writer in 1980, 1981, 1983, 1984 and 1989 as well. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBecause of the long-term effects of inflation, notably the significant increase of movie theater ticket prices, the list unadjusted for inflation gives far more weight to later films.[22] The unadjusted list, while commonly found in the press, is therefore largely meaningless for comparing films widely separated in time, as many films from earlier eras will never appear on a modern unadjusted list, despite achieving higher commercial success when adjusted for price increases.[23] To compensate for the devaluation of the currency, some charts make adjustments for inflation, but not even this practice fully addresses the issue, since ticket prices and inflation do not necessarily parallel one another. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAt least eleven films have held the record of 'highest-grossing film' since *The Birth of a Nation* assumed the top spot in 1915. Both *The Birth of a Nation* and *Gone with the Wind* spent twenty-five consecutive years apiece as the highest-grosser, with films directed by Steven Spielberg and James Cameron holding the record on three occasions each. Spielberg became the first director to break his own record when *Jurassic Park* overtook *E.T.*, and Cameron emulated the feat when *Avatar* broke the record set by *Titanic*. When it took over the top spot in 2019, *Avengers: Endgame* became the first sequel to hold the record of highest-grossing film, and in doing so interrupted thirty-six years of Spielberg/Cameron dominance before *Avatar* reclaimed the top spot two years later in 2021 upon a re-release.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn this chart, films are ranked by the revenues from theatrical exhibition at their nominal value, along with the highest positions they attained. Six films in total have grossed in excess of $2\u00a0billion worldwide, with *Avatar* ranked in the top position. All of the films have had a theatrical run (including re-releases) in the 21st century, and films that have not played during this period do not appear on the chart because of ticket-price inflation, population size and ticket purchasing trends not being considered.\n\n\n\n\n\u2020 *Background shading indicates films playing in the week commencing 13 June 2024 in theaters around the world*.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | [# 3] |\n| 2021[97] | *Avatar* | $2,847,397,339 \u2021 | [# 1] |\n| *2022* | $2,923,706,026 \u2021 |\n\n\nRDistributor rental.\n\n\n\u2021Includes revenue from re-releases.

Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n97. **^** Tartaglione, Nancy (March 13, 2021). \"'Avatar' Overtakes 'Avengers: Endgame' As All-Time Highest-Grossing Film At Global Box Office; China Reissue Growing\". *Deadline Hollywood*.

The methodology is based on the concept that films associated with things audiences are already familiar with can be more effectively marketed to them, and as such are known as \"pre-sold\" films within the industry.[108]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n58. **^** Shearer, Lloyd (October 26, 1947). \"GWTW: Supercolossal Saga of an Epic\". *The New York Times*.

Putting *The Birth of a Nation* in fifth place is open to question, since it is generally conceded to be the top-grossing film of all time. However, it has always been difficult to obtain reliable box-office figures for this film, and it may have been even more difficult in the mid-1930s. After listing it until the mid-1970s as *the* top-grosser, though finding it impossible to quote exact figures, *Variety*, the trade journal, suddenly repudiated the claim but without giving specific details or reasons. On the basis of the number of paid admissions, and *continuous* exhibition, its number one position seems justified.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* Original release: \"Back to the Future (1985)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

Included on the list are charts of the top box-office earners (ranked by both the nominal and real value of their revenue), a chart of high-grossing films by calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing film franchises and series.

Once revenue from home entertainment is factored in, it is not immediately clear which film is the most successful. *Titanic* earned $1.2\u00a0billion from video and DVD sales and rentals,[1] in addition to the $2.2\u00a0billion it grossed in theatres. While complete sales data are not available for *Avatar*, it earned $345\u00a0million from the sale of sixteen\u00a0million DVD and Blu-ray units in North America,[2] and ultimately sold a total of thirty\u00a0million DVD and Blu-ray units worldwide.[3] After home video income is accounted for, both films have earned over $3\u00a0billion each. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* *Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid*: \"Domestic Rentals: $29.2; Foreign Rentals: $7.9; Production Cost: $6.6 (Initial Release \u2013 Unadjusted $s in Millions of $s).\"\n211. **^** *Lawrence of Arabia*\n\n\t* 1962 release: \"Lawrence of Arabia\". *The Numbers*.

It signifies the material appearance or incarnation of a powerful deity, or spirit on Earth.[1][2] The relative verb to \"alight, to make one's appearance\" is sometimes used to refer to any guru or revered human being.[3][4]\n\n\nThe word *avatar* does not appear in the Vedic literature;[5] however, it appears in developed forms in post-Vedic literature, and as a noun particularly in the Puranic literature after the 6th century CE.[6] Despite that, the concept of an avatar is compatible with the content of the Vedic literature like the Upanishads as it is symbolic imagery of the Saguna Brahman concept in the philosophy of Hinduism. The *Rigveda* describes Indra as endowed with a mysterious power of assuming any form at will.[7][8] The *Bhagavad Gita* expounds the doctrine of Avatara but with terms other than *avatar*.[6][4]\n\n\nTheologically, the term is most often associated with the Hindu god Vishnu, though the idea has been applied to other deities.[9] Varying lists of avatars of Vishnu appear in Hindu scriptures, including the ten Dashavatara of the *Garuda Purana* and the twenty-two avatars in the *Bhagavata Purana*, though the latter adds that the incarnations of Vishnu are innumerable.[10] The avatars of Vishnu are important in Vaishnavism theology. In the goddess-based Shaktism tradition of Hinduism, avatars of the Devi in different appearances such as Tripura Sundari, Durga, Chandi, Chamunda, Mahakali, and Kali are commonly found.[11][12][13] While avatars of other deities such as Ganesha and Shiva are also mentioned in medieval Hindu texts, this is minor and occasional.[14] The incarnation doctrine is one of the important differences between Vaishnavism and Shaivism traditions of Hinduism.[15][16]\n\n\nIncarnation concepts that are in some aspects similar to *avatar* are also found in Buddhism,[17] Christianity,[5] and other religions.[17]\n\n\nThe scriptures of Sikhism include the names of numerous Hindu gods and goddesses, but it rejected the doctrine of savior incarnation and endorsed the view of Hindu Bhakti movement saints such as Namdev, that formless eternal god is within the human heart, and man is his own savior.[18][19]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology and meaning[edit]\n\n\nThe Sanskrit noun (**avat\u0101ra**, Hindustani: [\u0259\u028b\u02c8ta\u02d0r]) is derived from the Sanskrit prefix *ava-* (down) and the root **t\u1e5b** (to cross over).[20] These roots trace back, states Monier-Williams, to *-taritum*, *-tarati*, *-r\u012btum*.[3]\n\n\n*Avatar* means \"descent, alight, to make one's appearance\",[3] and refers to the embodiment of the essence of a superhuman being or a deity in another form.[20] The word also implies \"to overcome, to remove, to bring down, to cross something\".[3] In Hindu traditions, the \"crossing or coming down\" is symbolism, states Daniel Bassuk, of the divine descent from \"eternity into the temporal realm, from unconditioned to the conditioned, from infinitude to finitude\".[5] An avatar, states Justin Edwards Abbott, is a *saguna* (with form, attributes) embodiment of the *nirguna* Brahman or Atman (soul).[21] Avatar, according to \nBhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati actually means 'Divine Descent' in his commentaries of The Shrimad Bhagavatam and The Bramha Samhita (mentioned in Brahmavaivarta Purana).\n\n\nNeither the Vedas nor the Principal Upanishads ever mention the word *avatar* as a noun.[5] The verb roots and form, such as *avatarana*, appear in ancient post-Vedic Hindu texts, but as \"action of descending\", but not as an incarnated person (avatara).[22] The related verb *avatarana* is, states Paul Hacker, used with double meaning, one as action of the divine descending, another as \"laying down the burden of man\" suffering from the forces of evil.[22]\n\n\nThe term is most commonly found in the context of the Hindu god Vishnu.[1][3] The earliest mention of Vishnu manifested in a human form to establish Dharma on Earth, uses other terms such as the word *sambhav\u0101mi* in verse 4.6 and the word *tanu* in verse 9.11 of the Bhagavad Gita,[4] as well as other words such as *akriti* and *rupa* elsewhere.[23] It is in medieval era texts, those composed after the sixth century CE, that the noun version of avatar appears, where it means embodiment of a deity.[6] The idea proliferates thereafter, in the Puranic stories for many deities, and with ideas such as *ansha-avatar* or partial embodiments.[4][1]\n\n\nThe term *avatar*, in colloquial use, is also an epithet or a word of reverence for any extraordinary human being who is revered for his or her ideas.[20] In some contexts, the term *avatara* just means a \"landing place, site of sacred pilgrimage\", or just \"achieve one's goals after effort\", or retranslation of a text in another language.[3] The term *avatar* is not unique to Hinduism even though the term originated with Hinduism. It is found in the *Trikaya* doctrine of Mahayana Buddhism, in descriptions for the Dalai Lama in Tibetan Buddhism, and many ancient cultures.[17]\n\n\n\n### Avatar versus incarnation[edit]\n\n\nThe manifest embodiment is sometimes referred to as an incarnation.[24] The translation of avatar as \"incarnation\" has been questioned by Christian theologians, who state that an incarnation is in flesh and imperfect, while avatar is mythical and perfect.[25][26] The theological concept of Christ as an incarnation, as found in Christology, presents the Christian concept of incarnation. The term avatar in Hinduism refers to act of various gods taking form to perform a particular task which in most of the times is bringing dharma back. The concept of avatar is widely accepted all over the India.[27] Sheth disagrees and states that this claim is an incorrect understanding of the Hindu concept of avatar.[28][note 1] Avatars are embodiments of spiritual perfection, driven by noble goals, in Hindu traditions such as Vaishnavism.[28] The concept of the avatar in Hinduism is not incompatible with natural conception through a sexual act, which is again different from the Christian concept of the Virgin Birth.\n\n\n\n### As a loanword[edit]\n\n\nFollowing 19th Century Western interest in Indian culture and Hinduism, the word \"Avatar\" was taken as loanword into English and other Western languages, where it is used in various contexts and meanings, often considerably different from its original meaning in Hinduism - see Avatar (disambiguation).\n\n\n\n## Avatars of Vishnu[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Vishnu\n\nThe concept of avatar within Hinduism is most often associated with Vishnu, the preserver or sustainer aspect of God within the Hindu Trinity or Trimurti of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. Vishnu's avatars descend to empower the good and fight evil, thereby restoring Dharma. Traditional Hindus see themselves not as \"Hindu\", but as Vaishnava (Worshippers of Vishnu), Shaiva (Worshippers of Shiva), or Shakta (Worshipper of the Shakti). Each of the deities has its own iconography and mythology, but common to all is the fact that the divine reality has an explicit form, a form that the worshipper can behold.[30] An oft-quoted passage from the Bhagavad Gita describes the typical role of an avatar of Vishnu:[9][26]\n\n\n\n\n> Arjuna, whenever righteousness is on the decline, unrighteousness is in the ascendant, then I body Myself forth.  \n> \n> For the protection of the virtuous, for the extirpation of evil-doers, & for establishing Dharma (righteousness) on a firm footing, I manifest Myself from age to age.\n> \u2014\u200aBhagavad Gita 4.7\u20138\n> \n\n\nThe Vishnu avatars appear in Hindu mythology whenever the cosmos is in crisis, typically because evil has grown stronger and has thrown the cosmos out of its balance.[31] The avatar then appears in a material form, to destroy evil and its sources, and restore the cosmic balance between the ever-present forces of good and evil.[31]\n\n\nThe most known and celebrated avatars of Vishnu, within the Vaishnavism traditions of Hinduism, are Krishna, Rama, Narayana and Vasudeva. These names have extensive literature associated with them, each has its own characteristics, legends and associated arts.[26] The Mahabharata, for example, includes Krishna, while the Ramayana includes Rama.[32]\n\n\n\n### Dashavatara[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dashavatara\n\nThe Bhagavata Purana describes Vishnu's avatars as innumerable, though ten of his incarnations, the Dashavatara, are celebrated therein as his major appearances.[10][26] The ten major Vishnu avatars are mentioned in the Agni Purana, the Garuda Purana and the Bhagavata Purana.[33][34]\n\n\nThe ten best known avatars of Vishnu are collectively known as the *Dashavatara* (a Sanskrit compound meaning \"ten avatars\"). Five different lists are included in the Bhagavata Purana, where the difference is in the sequence of the names. Freda Matchett states that this re-sequencing by the composers may be intentional, so as to avoid implying priority or placing something definitive and limited to the abstract.[35]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Avatars of Vishnu\n| Name\n | Description\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Matsya | The fish avatar. He saves Manu and the seven sages from the cosmic flood, and in some traditions, saves the Vedas from an asura called Hayagriva.[36] |\n| Kurma[note 2] | The tortoise/turtle avatar. He supports the mountain named Mandara while the devas and the asuras churn the ocean of milk to produce the nectar of immortality.[38] |\n| Varaha | The boar avatar. He rescues Bhumi, the goddess of the earth, when the asura Hiranyaksha abducts her, restoring her rightful place in the universe.[39] |\n| Narasimha | The lion avatar. He saves his devotee Prahlada and frees the three worlds from the tyranny of an asura named Hiranyakashipu.[40] |\n| Vamana | The dwarf avatar. He vanquishes the asura king Mahabali to the netherworld after taking three strides upon the universe, restoring the rule of Indra.[41] |\n| Parashurama | The warrior-sage avatar. He destroys the oppressive kings of the military class and creates a new social order.[42] |\n| Rama | The prince avatar. He rescues his wife Sita when she is abducted by the rakshasa king Ravana, restoring just rule to the world.[43] |\n| Balarama (debated)\n | The elder brother of Krishna and the god of agriculture. He is variously described as an avatar of Shesha, the serpent-mount of Vishnu, and an avatar of Vishnu.[44] |\n| Krishna | The eighth avatar of Vishnu who incarnates to re-establish righteousness in the world. He slays Kamsa, the tyrant of Mathura and his uncle, and participates in the Kurukshetra War as the charioteer of Arjuna.[45] |\n| Buddha (debated)\n | The historical Buddha, who incarnates to delude the asuras from the path of the Vedas, ensuring the victory of the devas. In some traditions, he is referred to as an avatar of Vishnu.[46] |\n| Kalki | The prophesied tenth avatar of Vishnu. He incarnates to bring an end to the present age of corruption called the Kali Yuga, re-establishing the four classes and law to the world.[47] |\n\n\n### Longer alternatives[edit]\n\n\nThe Bhagavata Purana also goes on to give an alternate list, wherein it numerically lists out 23 Vishnu avatars in chapter 1.3.[48]\n\n\n\n1. Four Kumaras (Catu\u1e25sana): the four sons of Brahma who exemplify the path of devotion.\n2. Varaha: The boar avatar.

One approach was to identify full avatars and partial avatars. Krishna, Rama, and Narasimha were full avatars (*purna avatars*), while others were partial avatars (*ansha avatars*).[29] Some declared, states Noel Sheth, that every living creature is an *avatar* of Vishnu.[29] The Pancharatra text of Vaishnavism declares that Vishnu's avatars include those that are direct and complete (*sakshad*), indirect and endowed (*avesha*), cosmic and salvific (*vyuha*), inner and inspirational (*antaryamin*), consecrated and in the form of image (*archa*).[29]\n\n\nYet another classification, developed in Krishna schools, centers around *Guna-avatars*, *Purusha-avatars* and *Lila-avatars*, with their subtypes.[53][54] The *Guna-avatar* classification of *avatars* is based on the Gu\u1e47as concept of the Samkhya school of Hindu philosophy, that is Rajas (Brahma), Sattva (Vishnu), and Tamas (Shiva).[53][54] These personalities of the Trimurti are referred to as *Guna avatars*.[53] The *Purushavatara* are three. The first evolves all matter (Prakriti), the second is the soul present in each individual creature, the third is the interconnected oneness or Brahman that connects all souls.[53][55] The *Lilavataras* are partial or full manifestations of Vishnu, where either some powers (Shakti) or material parts of him exist.[53][54]\n\n\nVishnu is Purushavatara.[56][57] The Matsya, Kurma, and Vamana avatars of Vishnu are Lilavataras.[54][56] A *Purnarupa* in this classification, is when Vishnu manifests completely along with his qualities and powers. In Bengal Vaishnavism, Krishna is the *Purnarupa*.[53] In Shaivism, Bhairava is the purnarupa of Shiva.[58]\n\n\n\n### In Sikhism[edit]\n\n\n24 avatars of Vishnu are mentioned in Bachitar Natak's composition in Dasam Granth, the second scripture of Sikhism written by Guru Gobind Singh:[59]\n\n\n\n1. Mach (Matsya)\n2. Kach (Kurma)\n3. Nara (Nara in Nara-Narayana)\n4. Narayan (Narayana in Nara-Narayana)\n5. Maha Mohini (Mohini)\n6. Bairaha (Varaha)\n7. Nar Singha (Narasimha)\n8. Baman (Vamana)\n9. Parshuram (Parashurama)\n10. Bramma (Brahma)\n11. Balram (Balarama)\n12. Jalandhar (Jalandhara)\n13. Bishan (Vishnu)\n14. Sheshayi (Shesha)\n15. Arihant Dev (Arihanta)\n16. Manu Raja (Manu)\n17. Dhanvantari (Dhanvantari)\n18. Suraj (Surya)\n19. Chandar (Chandra)\n20. Ram (Rama)\n21. Kishan (Krishna)\n22. Nar (Arjuna)\n23. Rudra (Shiv)\n24. Kalki (Kalki)\n\nThe Guru Granth Sahib reverentially includes the names of numerous Hindu deities, including Vishnu avatars such as Krishna, Hari, and Rama, as well those of Devi as Durga.[60][61][62]\n\n\nDasam Granth has three major compositions, one each dedicated to avatars of Vishnu (Chaubis avatar) and Brahma.[59][63] However, Sikhism rejects the doctrine of savior incarnation, and only accepts the abstract *nirguna* formless god.[18][64] The Sikh Gurus endorsed the view of Hindu Bhakti movement saints such as Namdev (\u22481270 \u2013 1350 CE) that formless eternal god is within the human heart and man is his own savior.[18][65]\n\n\n\n### In Isma'ilism[edit]\n\n\nThe Gupti Ismailis, who observe pious circumspection as Hindus, uphold that the first Shi\u2018i Imam, \u2018Ali b. Abi Talib, as well as his descendants through the line of Isma\u2018il, are collectively Kalki, the tenth and final *avat\u0101ra* of Vishnu. According to this interpretation, these figures represent the continuity of divine guidance to humankind. In the view of some Guptis, this is corroborated by the Quranic verse 14:4 which mentions the idea that God had sent a messenger to every land. They understand the *avat\u0101ras* to be these messengers sent by God to their people in the Indian subcontinent.[66]\n\n\n\n## Avatars of Shiva[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sharabha (right) with Narasimha (18th-century painting, Pahari/Kangra School)\nAlthough Puranic scriptures contain occasional references to avatars of Shiva, the avatar doctrine is neither universally accepted nor commonly adopted in Shaivism.[67] The views on the doctrine of incarnation has been one of the significant doctrinal differences between Vaishnavism and Shaivism, in addition to their differences on the role of householder life versus monastic life for spiritual release.[15][16][68] Shaivism is a transcendental theology, where man, with the help of his Guru, is his own savior.[68]\n\n\nThe Linga Purana lists twenty-eight avatars of Shiva.[69] In the Shiva Purana there is a distinctly Saivite version of a traditional avatar myth: Shiva brings forth Virabhadra, one of his terrifying forms, in order to calm Narasimha, an avatar of Vishnu. When that fails, Shiva manifests as the human-lion-bird Sharabha which calms down lion-man Narasimha avatar of Vishnu, and Shiva then gives Vishnu a chakra (not to be confused with Sudarshan Chakra) as gift. A similar story is told in the late medieval era Sharabha Upanishad.[70] However, Vaishnava Dvaita school refutes this Shaivite view of Narasimha.[71] According to the Shiva Purana, Lord Shiva has 19 avatars. According to the Kurma Purana, he has 28.\n\n\nThe vanara god Hanuman who helped Rama (the Vishnu avatar) is considered by some to be the eleventh avatar of Rudra (Shiva).[72][73] Some regional deities like Khandoba are also believed by some to be avatars of Shiva.[74][75]\nAshwatthama, the son of Drona is also considered to be an Avatar of Lord Shiva.\n\n\nShesha and his avatars (Balarama and Lakshmana) are occasionally linked to Shiva.[76][77][78][79] Adi Shankara, the formulator of Advaita Vedanta, is also occasionally regarded as an avatar of Shiva.[80]\n\n\nIn Dasam Granth, Guru Gobind Singh mentioned two avatars of Rudra: Dattatreya Avatar and Parasnath Avatar.[81]\n\n\n\n## Avatars of Devis[edit]\n\n\n![An 18th century painting of the goddess Durga fighting Mahishasura](image)\n![A ca. 1910 chromolithograph of Kali trampling Shiva by Raja Ravi Varma](image)\n![An early 20th century chromolithograph of Sita in exile by Raja Ravi Varma](image)\n![The Hindu deity Parvati, 1050-1100 AD India](image)\nAvatars of Devi. Clockwise from upper left: Durga, Kali, Parvati and Sita.\n\nAvatars are also observed in Shaktism, the sect dedicated to the worship of the Goddess (Devi), but they do not have universal acceptance in the sect. The Devi Bhagavata Purana describes the descent of Devi avatars to punish the wicked and defend the righteous as \u2013 much as the Bhagavata Purana does with the avatars of Vishnu.[82]\n\n\nNilakantha, an 18th-century commentator on the Devi Bhagavata Purana\u00a0\u2013 which includes the Devi Gita\u00a0\u2013 says that various avatars of the Goddess includes Shakambhari and even the masculine Krishna and Rama\u00a0\u2013 generally thought to be Vishnu's avatars.[83] Parvati, Lakshmi and Saraswati are main goddesses worshipped as Devi avatars.[84]\n\n\n\n### Avatars of Parvati[edit]\n\n\nDevi is popular in her form as Parvati. In Devi Mahatmya she is seen as the Goddess Mahakali, and in Uma Samhita, she is seen as Devi herself. Regarding her incarnations, it varies per sect in Hinduism. She could be all Goddesses as said in Shaivism and some main Shatism interpretations like the Sri kula and Kali Kula families, or just a form of Devi in some other Shaktism interpretations and many Vaishnava interpretations. With this in mind, Parvati's forms include:\n\n\n\n* Mahakali\n* Sati\n* Mahavidyas- Kali, Tara, Tripurasundari, Bhuvaneshwari, Bhairavi, Chinnamasta, Dhumavati, Bagalamukhi\n* The 64 Shakti Peethas\n* Navadurgas - Shailaputri, Brahmacharini, Chandraghanta, Kushmanda, Skandamata, Katyayani, Kaalratri, Mahagauri, Siddhidhatri\n* Annapurna\n* Kaushiki\n* Durga\n* Shitala\n* Maheshwari\n* Ardhanarishvara\n* Vindhyavasini\n* Bhramari\n* Shakambhari\n* Raktadantika\n* Twarita\n* In North India- Khodiyar, Bahuchara Mata, Naina Devi, Jwala etc.\n* In Western India- Bhavani, Saptashrungi, Ekvira, Amba etc.\n* In East India-Dakshina Kali, Kamakhya, Jagadhatri etc.\n* In South India- Meenakshi, Vishalakshi, Kamakshi, Abhirami, Mookambika, Akilandeswari, Mariamman, Karumariamman etc.\n\n\nAll of these incarnations helped provide security to the world and even brought Shiva into the participation of worldly affairs.[85]\n\n\n\n### Avatars of Lakshmi[edit]\n\n\nLike Vishnu, his consort Lakshmi incarnates as in many forms to help provide order and to enlighten the world with her consort. She has many forms, and just like Parvati, some of her forms are not consistent throughout all sects and interpretations of Hinduism. In Vaishnavism and some interpretations of Shaktism, Lakshmi is seen as Devi herself. She could be every Goddess as said in Vaishnavism and some interpretations of Shaktism, or just another form of Devi as seen in other interpretations of Shaktism and in Shaivism. With this in mind, Lakshmi's forms include:\n\n\n\n* Mahalakshmi\n* At 108 Divya Desam\n* Ashtalakshmi - Adi Lakshmi, Dhanya Lakshmi, Dhana Lakshmi, Gaja Lakshmi, Santana Lakshmi, Vidya Lakshmi, Veera Lakshmi, Vijaya Lakshmi\n* With avatars of Vishnu - Sita, Radha, Gopi, Rukmini, Ashtabharya, Junior wives of Krishna, Padmavathi, Lakshmi Narayana, Andal, Dharini\n* Singular forms - Vedavati, Chottanikkara Bhagavathy, Mookambika devi, Vaishno Devi, As Kolhapur ambabai\n* Matrikas - Vaishnavi, Varahi, Narasimhi\n* Wives of Vishnu - Sri, Bhumi, Nila\n* Mahavidya Kamalatmika\n\n\n## Avatars of Brahma[edit]\n\n\nIn Dasam Granth, second scriptures of Sikhs written by Guru Gobind Singh, mentioned seven Brahma Avatars.[86]\n\n\n\n1. Valmiki\n2. Kashyapa\n3. Shukra\n4. Baches\n5. Vyasa\n6. Khat\n7. Kalidasa\n\n\nKhat avatar in this list refers to six different scholars who are considered to be founders of six schools of Indian philosophy.[87] According to the Skanda Purana, Brahma incarnated himself as Yajnavalkya in response to a curse from Shiva.[88]\n\n\n\n## Avatars of Ganesha[edit]\n\n\nThe Linga Purana declares that Ganesha incarnates to destroy demons and to help the gods and pious people.[89] The two Upapuranas\u00a0\u2013 Ganesha Purana and Mudgala Purana\u00a0\u2013 detail the avatars of Ganesha. Both these upapuranas are core scriptures of the Ganapatya sect\u00a0\u2013 exclusively dedicated to Ganesha worship.\n\n\nFour avatars of Ganesha are listed in the Ganesha Purana: Mohotkata, May\u016bre\u015bvara, Gajanana and Dhumraketu. Each avatar corresponds to a different yuga, has a different mount and different skin complexion, but all the avatars have a common purpose\u00a0\u2013 to slay demons.[90]\n\n\nThe Mudgala Puranam describes eight avatars of Ganesha:[91]\n\n\n\n1. Vakratunda (*Vakratu\u1e47\u1e0da*) (\"twisting trunk\"), his mount is a lion.\n2. Ekadanta (\"single tusk\"), his mount is a mouse.\n3. Mahodara (\"big belly\"), his mount is a mouse.\n4. Gajavaktra (or Gaj\u0101nana) (\"elephant face\"), his mount is a mouse.\n5. Lambodara (\"pendulous belly\"), his mount is a mouse.\n6. Vikata (*Vika\u1e6da*) (\"unusual form\", \"misshapen\"), his mount is a peacock.\n7. Vighnaraja (*Vighnar\u0101ja*) (\"king of obstacles\"), his mount is the celestial serpent *\u015ae\u1e63a*.\n8. Dhumravarna (*Dh\u016bmravar\u1e47a*) (\"grey color\") corresponds to \u015aiva, his mount is a horse.\n\n\n## Avatars of Varuna[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jhulelal, incarnation of Varuna\nJhulelal, the I\u1e63\u1e6da-devat\u0101 (most-revered deity) of Sindhi Hindus, is considered the incarnation of Varuna.[92]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Hinduism portal\n* ![](image)Philosophy portal\n* ![flag](image)India portal\n\n\n* Abatur\n* Avatars in the Mahabharata\n* Dashavatara\n* Gautama Buddha in Hinduism\n* Incarnation\n* List of avatar claimants\n* Hindu eschatology\n\n\n## Explanatory notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Buddha, a real person, is included as an avatar of Vishnu in many Hindu texts.[29]\n2. **^** Mohini, the female avatar of Vishnu, appears in stories about the Kurma avatar.[37]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** James Lochtefeld (2002), \"Avatar\" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A-M, Rosen Publishing, ISBN\u00a00-8239-2287-1, pages 72\u201373\n2. **^** Geoffrey Parrinder (1997). *Avatar and Incarnation: The Divine in Human Form in the World's Religions*.

At the end of the meditation a drop of perspiration was produced from his forehead. That drop, of the shape of a bubble, in a moment fell on the earth. O you of an excellent face, I, having three eyes, a trident, and adorned with the crown of the matted hair, was born from that bubble. With modesty I asked the lord of gods: \"What shall I do?\" Then God Visnu, with delight, thus spoke to me: \"O Rudra, you will bring about a fierce-looking destruction of the world, (after) actually being (my) portion, viz.

The total coverage was \u00a31,000,000 (\u00a3102,000,000 today) per ship. The policy was to be \"free from all average\" under \u00a3150,000, meaning that the insurers would only pay for damage in excess of that sum. The premium, negotiated by brokers Willis Faber & Company (now Willis Group), was 15 *s* (75 *p*) per \u00a3100, or \u00a37,500 (\u00a3940,000 today) for the term of one year. Lloyd's paid the White Star Line the full sum owed to them within 30 days.[197]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe ship's passengers brought with them a huge amount of baggage; another 19,455 cubic feet (550.9\u00a0m3) was taken up by first- and second-class baggage. In addition, there was a considerable quantity of regular cargo, ranging from furniture to foodstuffs, and a 1912 Renault Type CE Coupe de Ville motor car.[65] Despite later myths, the cargo on *Titanic*'s maiden voyage was fairly mundane; there was no gold, exotic minerals or diamonds, and one of the more famous items lost in the shipwreck, a jewelled copy of the *Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam*, was valued at only \u00a3405 (\u00a350,600 today).[66] According to the claims for compensation filed with Commissioner Gilchrist, following the conclusion of the Senate Inquiry, the single most highly valued item of luggage or cargo was a large neoclassical oil painting entitled *La Circassienne au Bain* by French artist Merry-Joseph Blondel. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*Titanic* was launched at 12:15\u00a0pm on 31 May 1911 in the presence of Lord Pirrie, J. Pierpont Morgan, J. Bruce Ismay and 100,000 onlookers.[91][92] Twenty-two tons of soap and tallow were spread on the slipway to lubricate the ship's passage into the River Lagan.[90] In keeping with the White Star Line's traditional policy, the ship was not formally named or christened with champagne.[91] The ship was towed to a fitting-out berth where, over the course of the next year, her engines, funnels and superstructure were installed and her interior was fitted out.[93]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*Titanic*'s crew were divided into three principal departments: Deck, with 66 crew; Engine, with 325; and Victualling, with 494.[111] The vast majority of the crew were thus not seamen but were either engineers, firemen, or stokers, responsible for looking after the engines, or stewards and galley staff, responsible for the passengers.[112] Of these, over 97% were male; just 23 of the crew were female, mainly stewardesses.[113] The rest represented a great variety of professions\u2014bakers, chefs, butchers, fishmongers, dishwashers, stewards, gymnasium instructors, laundrymen, waiters, bed-makers, cleaners, and even a printer,[113] who produced a daily newspaper for passengers called the *Atlantic Daily Bulletin* with the latest news received by the ship's wireless operators.[48][h]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMost of the crew signed on in Southampton on 6 April;[15] in all, 699 of the crew came from there, and 40% were natives of the town.[113] A few specialist staff were self-employed or were subcontractors. These included the five postal clerks, who worked for the Royal Mail and the United States Post Office Department, the staff of the First Class *\u00c0 La Carte* Restaurant and the Caf\u00e9 Parisien, the radio operators (who were employed by Marconi) and the eight musicians, who were employed by an agency and travelled as second-class passengers.[115] Crew pay varied greatly, from Captain Smith's \u00a3105 a month (equivalent to \u00a313,100 today) to the \u00a33 10*s* (\u00a3440 today) that stewardesses earned. The lower-paid victualling staff could, however, supplement their wages substantially through tips from passengers.[114]\n\n\n\n### Passengers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Passengers of *Titanic*\n\nSee also: Animals aboard *Titanic*\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe settlement was agreed to by 44 of the claimants in December 1915, with $500,000 set aside for the American claimants, $50,000 for the British, and $114,000 to go towards interest and legal expenses.[202][203]\n\n\n\n### Investigations into the disaster[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: United States Senate inquiry into the sinking of the *Titanic* and British Wreck Commissioner's inquiry into the sinking of the *Titanic*\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCaptain Edward John Smith, the most senior of the White Star Line's captains, was transferred from *Olympic* to take command of *Titanic*.[109] Henry Tingle Wilde also came across from *Olympic* to take the post of chief mate. *Titanic*'s previously designated chief mate and first officer, William McMaster Murdoch and Charles Lightoller, were bumped down to the ranks of first and second officer respectively. The original second officer, David Blair, was dropped altogether.[110][g] The third officer was Herbert Pitman, the only deck officer who was not a member of the Royal Naval Reserve.

White Star only settled for $664,000 (appr. $16.56\u00a0million in 2018), about 27% of the original total sought by survivors. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Fatalities | * Allison family\n* Thomas Andrews\n* John Jacob Astor IV\n* David John Bowen\n* Archibald Butt\n* Thomas Byles\n* Roderick Chisholm\n* Walter Donald Douglas\n* Annie Funk\n* Jacques Futrelle\n* Sidney Leslie Goodwin\n* Benjamin Guggenheim\n* John Harper\n* Henry B.

She was built by the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast. Thomas Andrews, the chief naval architect of the shipyard, died in the disaster. *Titanic* was under the command of Captain Edward Smith, who went down with the ship. The ocean liner carried some of the wealthiest people in the world, as well as hundreds of emigrants from the British Isles, Scandinavia, and elsewhere throughout Europe, who were seeking a new life in the United States and Canada.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**RMS *Titanic*** was a British passenger liner, operated by the White Star Line, that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean on 15 April 1912 after striking an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton, England, to New York City, United States. Of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, more than 1,500 died, making it the deadliest sinking of a single ship up to that time.[a] It remains the deadliest peacetime sinking of an ocean liner or cruise ship.[4] The disaster drew public attention, spurred major changes in maritime safety regulations, and inspired many artistic works.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBetween 2:10 and 2:15\u00a0am, a little over two and a half hours after *Titanic* struck the iceberg, her rate of sinking suddenly increased as the boat deck dipped underwater, and the sea poured in through open hatches and grates.[166] As her unsupported stern rose out of the water, exposing the propellers, the ship broke in two main pieces between the second and third funnels, due to the immense forces on the keel. With the bow underwater, and air trapped in the stern, the stern remained afloat and buoyant for a few minutes longer, rising to a nearly vertical angle with hundreds of people still clinging to it,[167] before foundering at 2:20\u00a0am.[168] It was believed that *Titanic* sank in one piece, but the discovery of the wreck many years later revealed that she had broken in two. All remaining passengers and crew were immersed in water at a temperature of \u22122\u00a0\u00b0C (28\u00a0\u00b0F). Only five who were in the water were helped into the lifeboats, though the lifeboats had room for almost 500 more people.[169]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** The death toll of the sinking of *Tek Sing* in 1822 is not known exactly, but it may have exceeded that of *Titanic*.\n2. **^** Carlisle would leave the project in 1910, before the ships were launched, when he became a shareholder in Welin Davit & Engineering Company Ltd, the firm making the ship's davits.[12] Wilding was sacked following the *Titanic* disaster, having been unfairly blamed by Pirrie for the ship's loss.[13]\n3. **^** It was kept off-limits to passengers; the famous \"flying\" scene at the ship's bow from the 1997 film *Titanic* would not have been permitted in real life.\n4. **^** Copy of the neoclassical oil painting by Merry-Joseph Blondel[63]\n5. **^** Measurement of lifeboats: **1\u20132:** 25'2\" long by 7'2\" wide by 3'2\" deep; 326.6 cubic feet (9.25\u00a0m3); **3\u201316:** 30' long by 9'1\" wide by 4' deep; 655.2 cubic feet (18.55\u00a0m3) and **A\u2013D:** 27'5\" long by 8' wide by 3' deep; 376.6 cubic feet (10.66\u00a0m3)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n65. **^** \"The car that went down with the Titanic\". *Fox News*. 10 October 2016.

The most noticeable exterior difference was that *Titanic* (and the third vessel in class, *Britannic*) had a steel screen with sliding windows installed along the forward half of the A Deck promenade. This was installed as a last minute change at the personal request of Bruce Ismay, and was intended to provide additional shelter to First Class passengers.[94] Extensive changes were made to B Deck on *Titanic* as the promenade space in this deck, which had proven unpopular on *Olympic*, was converted into additional First Class cabins, including two opulent parlour suites with their own private promenade spaces. The *\u00c0 la Carte* restaurant was also enlarged and the *Caf\u00e9 Parisien*, an entirely new feature which did not exist on *Olympic*, was added. These changes made *Titanic* slightly heavier than her sister, and thus she could claim to be the largest ship afloat. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Australia | * Bandstand (Ballarat)\n |\n| United Kingdom | * Engine Room Heroes (Liverpool)\n* Engineers (Southampton)\n* Musicians (Southampton)\n* *Titanic* (Belfast)\n* Orchestra (Liverpool)\n |\n| United States | * Straus Park (New York City)\n* *Titanic* (New York City)\n* *Titanic* (Washington, D.C.)\n* Butt\u2013Millet Memorial Fountain (Washington, D.C.)\n |\n\n |\n| Popular culture(cultural legacy) | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince its initial discovery, the wreck of *Titanic* has been revisited on numerous occasions by explorers, scientists, filmmakers, tourists and salvagers, who have recovered thousands of items from the debris field for conservation and public display. The ship's condition has deteriorated significantly over the years, particularly from accidental damage by submersibles but mostly because of an accelerating rate of growth of iron-eating bacteria on the hull.[263] In 2006, it was estimated that within 50 years the hull and structure of *Titanic* would eventually collapse entirely, leaving only the more durable interior fittings of the ship intermingled with a pile of rust on the sea floor.[264]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n176. **^** \"New Liner Titanic Hits an Iceberg; Sinking By the Bow at Midnight; Women Put Off in LIfeboats; Last Wireless at 12:27 am.

Just after the sinking, memorial postcards sold in huge numbers[287] together with memorabilia ranging from tin candy boxes to plates, whiskey jiggers,[288] and even black mourning teddy bears.[289] The sinking inspired many ballads such as \"The Titanic\".[290] Several survivors wrote books about their experiences,[291] but it was not until 1955 that the first historically accurate book \u2013 *A Night to Remember* \u2013 was published.[292]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe exact number of people aboard is not known, as not all of those who had booked tickets made it to the ship; about 50 people cancelled for various reasons,[121] and not all of those who boarded stayed aboard for the entire journey.[122] Fares varied depending on class and season. Third Class fares from London, Southampton, or Queenstown cost \u00a37 5*s* (equivalent to \u00a3900 today) while the cheapest First Class fares cost \u00a323 (\u00a32,900 today).[104] The most expensive First Class suites were to have cost up to \u00a3870 in high season (\u00a3109,000 today).[117]\n\n\n\n### Collecting passengers[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nRMS\u00a0*Oceanic* would remain on the route until the third new ship could be delivered.[*citation needed*] *Majestic* resumed her old position on the White Star Line's New York service post the loss of *Titanic*'.[8]\n\n\nThe ships were constructed by the Belfast shipbuilder Harland & Wolff, which had a long-established relationship with the White Star Line dating back to 1867.[9] Harland and Wolff were given a great deal of latitude in designing ships for the White Star Line; the usual approach was for Wilhelm Wolff to sketch a general concept, which Edward James Harland would turn into a ship design. Cost considerations were a relatively low priority; Harland & Wolff were authorised to spend what it needed on the ships, plus a five per cent profit margin.[9] In the case of the *Olympic*-class ships, a cost of \u00a33\u00a0million (approximately \u00a3310 million in 2019) for the first two ships was agreed plus \"extras to contract\" and the usual five per cent fee.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. **^** *Titanic* also had a ship's cat, Jenny, who gave birth to a litter of kittens shortly before the ship's maiden voyage; all perished in the sinking.[114]\n9. **^** Known afterward as the \"Unsinkable Molly Brown\" due to her efforts in helping other passengers while the ship sank.\n10. **^** Captain Edward Smith had been in command of *Titanic*'s sister *Olympic* when she in 1911 collided with a warship. Even though that ship was designed to sink others by ramming them, it suffered greater damage than *Olympic*, thereby strengthening the image of the class being unsinkable.[154][155]\n11. **^** The official enquiry found that damage extended about 300 feet, but both Edward Wilding's testimony and modern ultrasound surveys of the wreck suggest the total area was perhaps a few narrow openings totalling perhaps no more than 12 to 13 square feet (1.1 to 1.2\u00a0m2).[158][82]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTimeline of RMS *Titanic*\n* 17 September **1908**: ship ordered.[319]\n* 31 May **1911**: ship launched.[320]\n* 1 April **1912**: trials completed.[321]\n* 10 April, noon: maiden voyage starts.

Sir Alfred Chalmers, nautical adviser to the Board of Trade from 1896 to 1911, had considered the matter of adjusting the scale \"from time to time\", but because he not only assumed that experienced sailors would need to be carried \"uselessly\" aboard ship only to lower and man the extra lifeboats, but also anticipated the difficulty in getting away a greater number than 16 boats in any emergency, he \"did not consider it necessary to increase [the scale]\".[74]\n7. **^** He expressed deep disappointment about the decision before the voyage but was presumably greatly relieved afterwards.[110]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Beveridge, Bruce (2008).

The aim was to convey an impression that the passengers were in a floating hotel rather than a ship; as one passenger recalled, on entering the ship's interior a passenger would \"at once lose the feeling that we are on board ship, and seem instead to be entering the hall of some great house on shore\".[53]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe White Star Line faced an increasing challenge from its main rivals, Cunard\u2014which had recently launched *Lusitania* and *Mauretania*, the fastest passenger ships then in service\u2014and the German lines Hamburg America and Norddeutscher Lloyd. Ismay preferred to compete on size rather than speed and proposed to commission a new class of liners that would be larger than anything that had gone before, as well as being the last word in comfort and luxury.[7] The White Star Line sought an upgrade of its fleet primarily to respond to the introduction of the Cunard giants but also to considerably strengthen its position on the Southampton\u2013Cherbourg\u2013New York service that had been inaugurated in 1907. The new ships would have sufficient speed to maintain a weekly service with only three ships instead of the original four. Thus, the *Olympic* and *Titanic* would replace RMS\u00a0*Teutonic* of 1889, RMS\u00a0*Majestic* of 1890 as well as RMS\u00a0*Adriatic* of 1907. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n159. **^** Ballard 1987, p.\u00a022.\n160. **^** Hutchings & de Kerbrech 2011, p.\u00a0116.\n161. **^** Chirnside 2004, p.\u00a029.\n162. **^** Hutchings & de Kerbrech 2011, p.\u00a0109.\n163. **^** Barczewski 2006, p.\u00a021.\n164. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Barczewski 2006, p.\u00a0284.\n165. **^** \"Disproportionate Devastation | Titanic\".\n166. **^** Halpern & Weeks 2011, p.\u00a0118.\n167. **^** Barczewski 2006, p.\u00a029.\n168. **^** Barratt 2009, p.\u00a0131.\n169. **^** Lord 2005, p.\u00a0103.\n170. **^** Brewster & Coulter 1998, pp.\u00a045\u201347.\n171. **^** Brewster & Coulter 1998, pp.\u00a064\u201365.\n172. **^** Bartlett 2011, p.\u00a0238.\n173. **^** \"Titanic (ship) | Britannica\". *www.britannica.com*.

According to *Titanic*'s general arrangement plans, the ship could accommodate 833 First Class Passengers, 614 in Second Class and 1,006 in Third Class, for a total passenger capacity of 2,453. In addition, her capacity for crew members exceeded 900, as most documents of her original configuration have stated that her full carrying capacity for both passengers and crew was approximately 3,547.

Some survivors died shortly afterwards; injuries and the effects of exposure caused the deaths of several of those brought aboard *Carpathia*.[234] The figures show stark differences in the survival rates of the different classes aboard *Titanic*. Although only 3% of first-class women were lost, 54% of those in third-class died. Similarly, five of six first-class and all second-class children survived, but 52 of the 79 in third-class perished. The differences by gender were even bigger: nearly all female crew members, first- and second-class passengers were saved. Men from the First Class died at a higher rate than women from the Third Class.[235] In total, 50% of the children survived, 20% of the men and 75% of the women.\n\n\nThomas Andrews, the chief naval architect of the shipyard, died in the disaster.[236]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* RMS *Titanic*, Inc, exclusive steward of RMS *Titanic*\n* *Titanic* Historical Society\n* RMS *Titanic* at Curlie\n* Collection of Marconigram radio messages related to the *Titanic* Archived 25 January 2016 at the Wayback Machine\n* Titanic collected news and commentary at *The Guardian* ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n* *New York Times* coverage of the *Titanic*\n* \"Titanic in Black and White\" at Library of Virginia\n* Ruhlow, Tina (December 2020). \"50 Images From The Titanic You Have To See To Believe\". *Reference.com*.

Bruce Ismay and other White Star Line executives. Ismay approved the design and signed three \"letters of agreement\" two days later, authorising the start of construction.[14] At this point, the first ship\u2014which was later to become *Olympic*\u2014had no name but was referred to simply as \"Number 400\", as it was Harland and Wolff's four-hundredth hull. *Titanic* was based on a revised version of the same design and was given the number 401.[15]\n\n\n\n## Dimensions and layout[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Starboard view of *Titanic*\n*Titanic* was 882\u00a0feet 9\u00a0inches (269.06\u00a0m) long with a maximum breadth of 92\u00a0feet 6\u00a0inches (28.19\u00a0m).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*Titanic* was equipped with 16 lifeboat davits, each capable of lowering three lifeboats, for a total of 48 boats. However, she actually carried only 20 lifeboats, four of which were collapsible and proved hard to launch while she was sinking (Collapsible A nearly swamped and was filled with a foot of water until rescue; Collapsible B completely overturned while launching). Together, the 20 lifeboats could hold 1,178 people\u2014about half the number of passengers on board, and one-third of the number of passengers the ship could have carried at full capacity (a number consistent with the maritime safety regulations of the era). When the ship sank, the lifeboats that had been lowered were only filled up to an average of 60%.\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA Marconi wireless telegraph was installed to enable her to communicate with stations on the coast of Labrador and Newfoundland.[284][285]\n\n\nFinally, the disaster led to the formation and international funding of the International Ice Patrol, an agency of the U.S. Coast Guard that to the present day monitors and reports on the location of North Atlantic Ocean icebergs that could pose a threat to transatlantic sea traffic. Coast Guard aircraft conduct the primary reconnaissance. In addition, information is collected from ships operating in or passing through the ice area. Except for the years of the two World Wars, the International Ice Patrol has worked each season since 1913. During the period, there has not been a single reported loss of life or property due to collision with an iceberg in the patrol area.[286]\n\n\n\n### Cultural[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cultural legacy of *Titanic*\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe construction of *Olympic* and *Titanic* took place virtually in parallel, with *Olympic*'s keel laid down first on 16 December 1908 and *Titanic*'s on 31 March 1909.[15] Both ships took about 26 months to build and followed much the same construction process. They were designed essentially as an enormous floating box girder, with the keel acting as a backbone and the frames of the hull forming the ribs. At the base of the ships, a double bottom 5\u00a0feet 3\u00a0inches (1.60\u00a0m) deep supported 300 frames, each between 24 inches (61\u00a0cm) and 36 inches (91\u00a0cm) apart and measuring up to about 66 feet (20\u00a0m) long. They terminated at the bridge deck (B Deck) and were covered with steel plates which formed the outer skin of the ships.[78]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Titanic* received a series of warnings from other ships of drifting ice in the area of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, but Captain Smith ignored them.[149] One of the ships to warn *Titanic* was the Atlantic Line's *Mesaba*.[150] Nevertheless, *Titanic* continued to steam at full speed, which was standard practice at the time.[151] Although she was not trying to set a speed record,[152] timekeeping was a priority, and under prevailing maritime practices, ships were often operated at close to full speed; ice warnings were seen as advisories, and reliance was placed upon lookouts and the watch on the bridge.[151] It was generally believed that ice posed little danger to large vessels. Close calls with ice were not uncommon, and even head-on collisions had not been disastrous. In 1907, SS\u00a0*Kronprinz Wilhelm*, a German liner, had rammed an iceberg but still completed her voyage, and Smith said in 1907 that he \"could not imagine any condition which would cause a ship to founder. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn late August 2018, several groups were vying for the right to purchase the 5,500 *Titanic* relics that were an asset of the bankrupt Premier Exhibitions.[315] Eventually, *Titanic* Belfast, Titanic Foundation Limited and the National Museums Northern Ireland joined with the National Maritime Museum as a consortium that was raising money to purchase the 5,500 artefacts. The group intended to keep all of the items together as a single exhibit. Oceanographer Robert Ballard said he favoured this bid since it would ensure that the memorabilia would be permanently displayed in Belfast (where *Titanic* was built) and in Greenwich.[315] The museums were critical of the bid process set by the Bankruptcy court in Jacksonville, Florida. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUsually, a high-prestige vessel like *Titanic* could expect to be fully booked on its maiden voyage. However, a national coal strike in the UK had caused considerable disruption to shipping schedules in the spring of 1912, causing many crossings to be cancelled. Many would-be passengers chose to postpone their travel plans until the strike was over. The strike had finished a few days before *Titanic* sailed; however, that was too late to have much of an effect. *Titanic* was able to sail on the scheduled date only because coal was transferred from other vessels which were tied up at Southampton, such as SS\u00a0*City of New York* and RMS\u00a0*Oceanic*, as well as coal that *Olympic* had brought back from a previous voyage to New York, which had been stored at the White Star Dock.[94]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Hutchings, David F.; de Kerbrech, Richard P.

The starboard side of *Titanic* struck the iceberg, creating a series of holes below the waterline.[k] The hull was not punctured, but rather dented such that its seams buckled and separated, allowing water to rush in. Five of the watertight compartments were breached. It soon became clear that *Titanic* would sink, as she could not remain afloat with more than four compartments flooded. She began sinking bow-first, with water spilling from compartment to compartment as her angle in the water became steeper.[159]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n257. **^** \"Paper says Titanic discovered\". *The San Bernardino County Sun*. 1 September 1985. p.\u00a03.

They marched backward through the looking-glass.\"[284][285] In an opposing view, Tom Shone wrote that through *Star Wars* and *Jaws*, Lucas and Spielberg \"didn't betray cinema at all: they plugged it back into the grid, returning the medium to its roots as a carnival sideshow, a magic act, one big special effect\", which was \"a kind of rebirth\".[283]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe original *Star Wars* film was a huge success for 20th Century Fox, and was credited for reinvigorating the company. Within three weeks of the film's release, the studio's stock price doubled to a record high. Prior to 1977, 20th Century Fox's greatest annual profits were $37\u00a0million, while in 1977, the company broke that record by posting a profit of $79\u00a0million.[255] The franchise helped Fox to change from an almost bankrupt production company to a thriving media conglomerate.[276] With over $10.3 billion in worldwide box office receipts, *Star Wars* is the second-highest-grossing film franchise of all time.[277][278]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n26. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Hutt clan\". *StarWars.com*.

Before *Star Wars*, special effects in films had not appreciably advanced since the 1950s.[279] The commercial success of *Star Wars* created a boom in state-of-the-art special effects in the late 1970s.[276] Along with *Jaws*, *Star Wars* started the tradition of the summer blockbuster film in the entertainment industry, where films open on many screens at the same time and profitable franchises are important.[280][267] It created the model for the major film trilogy and showed that merchandising rights on a film could generate more money than the film itself did.[266]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAll nine films, collectively referred to as the \"Skywalker Saga\", were nominated for Academy Awards, with wins going to the first two releases. Together with the theatrical live action \"anthology\" films *Rogue One* (2016) and *Solo* (2018), the combined box office revenue of the films equated to over US$10\u00a0billion, making *Star Wars* the third-highest-grossing film franchise of all time.\n\n\n\n\n## Premise[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n278. **^** \"Movie Franchises\". *The Numbers*.

While filming the original 1977 film, George Lucas decided to take a $500,000 pay cut to his salary as director in exchange for full ownership of the franchise's merchandising rights. By 1987, the first three films have made US$2.6\u00a0billion in merchandising revenue.[223] By 2012, the first six films produced approximately US$20\u00a0billion in merchandising revenue.[224]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* \"The 33 Greatest Movie Trilogies | 2.

Weiss would serve as writers and producers on a trilogy of new *Star Wars* movies.[99] The plot would take place chronologically before the Prequel Trilogy, and center around the origin of the Jedi.[100] By May 2019, the duo were also slated to serve as co-directors of the first installment in their three films.[101] In October of the same year however, the filmmaking duo exited development of the projects due to scheduling conflicts with projects they are developing for Netflix. Kennedy stated that the studio is open to working with the duo, and developing their films once their schedule allows it.[102]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n*Star Wars* original trilogy\n |\n| --- |\n| Films | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Theatrical | * *Star Wars* (1977)\n* *The Empire Strikes Back* (1980)\n* *Return of the Jedi* (1983)\n |\n| Television | * *Holiday Special* (1978)\n* *Caravan of Courage* (1984)\n* *The Battle for Endor* (1985)\n |\n\n |\n| Characters | * Admiral Ackbar\n* Admiral Piett\n* Bib Fortuna\n* Boba Fett\n* C-3PO\n* Chewbacca\n* Darth Vader\n* R2-D2\n* Grand Moff Tarkin\n* Greedo\n* Han Solo\n* Jabba the Hutt\n* Lando Calrissian\n* Princess Leia Organa\n* Luke Skywalker\n* Mon Mothma\n* Nien Nunb\n* Obi-Wan Kenobi\n* Emperor Palpatine\n* Wedge Antilles\n* Wicket\n* Yoda\n |\n| Novelizations | * *Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker*\n* *The Empire Strikes Back*\n* *Return of the Jedi*\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Related novels | * *Splinter of the Mind's Eye*\n |\n\n |\n| Soundtracks | * *Star Wars*\n\t+ \"Main Title\"\n* *The Empire Strikes Back*\n\t+ \"The Imperial March\"\n* *Return of the Jedi*\n\t+ \"Ewok Celebration\"\n |\n| Video games | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe *Star Wars* saga has had a significant impact on popular culture,[263] with references to its fictional universe deeply embedded in everyday life.[264] Phrases like \"evil empire\" and \"May the Force be with you\" have become part of the popular lexicon.[265] The first *Star Wars* film in 1977 was a cultural unifier,[266] enjoyed by a wide spectrum of people.[267] The film can be said to have helped launch the science-fiction boom of the late 1970s and early 1980s, making science-fiction films a mainstream genre.[268] The widespread impact made it a prime target for parody works and homages, with popular examples including *Hardware Wars*, *Spaceballs*, *The Family Guy Trilogy* and *Robot Chicken: Star Wars*.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn April 2023, three new *Star Wars* films were announced to be set within different eras of the franchise.[94] An untitled film written and directed by James Mangold will be set during the \"dawn of the Jedi\".[94] Dave Filoni will direct a film set between the original and sequel trilogies during the New Republic era, serving as the climax of the various live-action television series that began with *The Mandalorian* in 2019.[94] Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy will direct a third film about a new Jedi Order, set fifteen years after the sequel trilogy.[93][95]\n\n\n\n#### Other potential projects[edit]\n\n\nLucasfilm has a number of *Star Wars* films in various stages of development, including: \n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n119. **^** Porter, Rick (September 29, 2021). \"'Mandalorian' Spinoff 'Book of Boba Fett' Gets December Date on Disney+\". *The Hollywood Reporter*.

The Russo brothers joined as directors in April 2015, with Markus and McFeely signing on to write the script a month later. The film serves as a conclusion to the story of the MCU up to that point, ending the story arcs for several main characters. The plot revisits several moments from earlier films, bringing back actors and settings from throughout the franchise. Filming began in August 2017 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, shooting back-to-back with *Infinity War*, and ended in January 2018. Additional filming took place in the Metro and Downtown Atlanta areas, the state of New York, Scotland, and England. The official title was revealed in December 2018. With an estimated budget of $356\u2013400\u00a0million, the film is one of the most expensive films ever made.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe two films will serve as the conclusion to Phase Six of the MCU.[212] Feige later stated that the Russo brothers would not be returning to direct the films.[213] Shortly after, Destin Daniel Cretton, who directed *Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings* (2021), was confirmed as director of *The Kang Dynasty*.[214] In September, *Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania* (2023) writer Jeff Loveness was revealed to be writing the screenplay.[215] The next month, *Loki* season one (2021) head writer and *Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness* (2022) writer Michael Waldron was hired to write the screenplay for *Avengers: Secret Wars*.[216] Shortly after, *Secret Wars*'s release date was pushed back to May 1, 2026.[217] In June 2023, Disney delayed *The Kang Dynasty* to May 1, 2026, and *Secret Wars* to May 7, 2027.[218] Both Loveness and Cretton were no longer involved with *The Kang Dynasty* by November 2023.[219][220]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAt the 92nd Academy Awards, *Avengers: Endgame* received a nomination for Best Visual Effects.[202] The film's other nominations include an Annie Award (which it won),[203] a British Academy Film Award,[204] and three Critics' Choice Movie Awards (winning two).[205] It was the most-viewed Wikipedia article of 2019, garnering 44.2 million page views.[206] In March 2020, *Endgame* was ranked 41st in an *Empire* magazine poll for the 100 greatest films of the 21st century.[207] In February 2022, the Avengers assembling moment was named one of the five finalists for Oscars Cheer Moment as part of the \"Oscars Fan Favorite\" contest for the 94th Academy Awards, despite the film not being eligible for other Academy Awards that year.[208]\n\n\n\n## Future[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Six\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMarvel Cinematic Universe\n |\n| --- |\n| * List of feature films\n\t+ accolades\n* List of television series\n\t+ accolades\n* Television specials\n* Timeline\n |\n| \n\n| Marvel Studios\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Infinity Saga | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n106. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Sonak, Divij (May 19, 2019). \"*Avengers: Endgame* VFX Supervisor Talks Aging & De-Aging Effects\". *Appocalypse.com*.

All 13 actors featured on the poster received top-billing except for Danai Gurira, whose name still appeared in the poster's bottom billing block along with Benedict Wong, Jon Favreau, and Gwyneth Paltrow (none of whom were featured on the poster). Despite this, her exclusion in the top billing prompted criticism from some fans.[38][131] Petrana Radulovic of *Polygon* noted how an actor is credited on the poster \"is a complex process\" based on \"dealing with agents, fees, and movie star demands.\"[38] However, Marvel Studios released an updated poster later that day with Gurira in the top billing.[38][131] The second trailer was viewed 268 million times in the first 24 hours, becoming the second most-viewed trailer in that time period behind the film's first trailer.[132]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWe wanted to be able to focus and shoot one movie and then focus and shoot another movie.\"[92] Anthony Russo originally felt it made more sense to shoot the films simultaneously due to financial and logistical reasons considering the large number of cast members,[93] and had suggested that \"some days we'll be shooting the first movie and some days we'll be shooting the second movie. Just jumping back and forth.\"[88] The 2013 Asgard scenes were shot at Durham Cathedral in Durham, England during production of *Infinity War* in early May 2017.[94][95] Production wrapped on January 11, 2018,[96] although additional filming took place in Dutchess and Ulster counties in New York in June 2018.[97] Reshoots began by September 7, 2018,[98] and concluded on October 12, 2018.[99] More reshoots occurred in January 2019.[100] Location shooting also took place in St Abbs, Scotland, which doubled for New Asgard in Norway.[101] Evans and Hemsworth each earned $15\u00a0million for the film.[102]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n214. **^** Kit, Borys (July 26, 2022). \"*Avengers: The Kang Dynasty* to Be Directed by *Shang-Chi* Filmmaker Destin Daniel Cretton (Exclusive)\". *The Hollywood Reporter*.
