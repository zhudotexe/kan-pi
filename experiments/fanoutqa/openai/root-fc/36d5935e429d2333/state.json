He went on to join AmeriCorps and earned a Master of Public Policy degree from Harvard University. Fetterman's service with AmeriCorps led him to Braddock, where he moved in 2004 and was elected mayor the following year. As mayor, Fetterman sought to revitalize the former steel town through art and youth programs.\n\n\nFetterman ran for the U.S. Senate in 2016, finishing third in the Democratic primary. He ran for lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania in 2018, defeating a field of candidates that included incumbent Mike Stack in the Democratic primary and winning the election with incumbent governor Tom Wolf.[4] During his tenure, Fetterman received national attention for his efforts to legalize cannabis statewide and for his opposition to President Donald Trump's false claims of election fraud in Pennsylvania.\n\n\nIn 2021, Fetterman announced his candidacy in the 2022 U.S. Senate election in Pennsylvania. He won the Democratic nomination with 59% of the vote and defeated Republican Party nominee Mehmet Oz in the general election with 51% of the vote, becoming the first Democrat to win this seat since 1962.[a] Fetterman resigned as lieutenant governor upon being sworn into the Senate on January 3, 2023.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nFetterman was born at Reading Hospital in West Reading, Pennsylvania, to Karl and Susan Fetterman,[6] both of whom were 19 years old.[7] Eventually they moved to York, Pennsylvania, where Fetterman grew up and his father became a partner at an insurance firm.[8][9][10] He grew up in an affluent suburb of York, and his parents were conservative Republicans.[8][11]\n\n\nFetterman had a self-described privileged upbringing; he said he \"sleepwalked\" as a young adult while playing four years of football in college, intending eventually to take over ownership of his father's business.[11][12] In 1991, Fetterman graduated from Albright College, also his father's alma mater, with a bachelor's in finance. He also received a Master of Business Administration (MBA) from the University of Connecticut (UConn) in 1993.[13][14] For two years Fetterman worked in Pittsburgh as a risk-management underwriter for Chubb.[15]\n\n\nWhile Fetterman was studying at UConn, his best friend died in a car accident; this impacted Fetterman's life and career.[16] After his friend's death, Fetterman joined Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, pairing with an eight-year-old boy in New Haven, Connecticut, whose father had died from AIDS and whose mother was slowly dying from the disease.[17] During his time as a Big Brother, Fetterman says he became \"preoccupied with the concept of the random lottery of birth\", and promised the boy's mother he would continue to look out for her son after she was gone.[18]\n\n\nIn 1995, Fetterman joined the recently founded AmeriCorps, and was sent to teach Pittsburgh students pursuing their GEDs.[19] He later attended Harvard Kennedy School at Harvard University, graduating in 1999 with a Master of Public Policy degree.[20]\n\n\nFetterman began his corporate career working at an insurance firm. He came to Braddock in 2001 to start an Out-of-School-Youth Program, helping local youth to earn their GEDs.[21] He moved to Braddock in 2004.[8][22]\n\n\n\n## Mayor of Braddock (2006\u20132019)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fetterman in 2009\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\nFetterman ran for mayor of Braddock against the incumbent, Pauline Abdullah, in 2005. With backing from the town's young residents, he won the Democratic primary by a single vote.[23][8] Fetterman won the general election;[24] he did not face a Republican opponent.[23]\n\n\nIn the 2009 Democratic primary for mayor of Braddock, Fetterman faced Jayme Cox.[25][26] During the campaign, Cox attacked him for failing to build consensus with the town council.[25] Cox also criticized Fetterman for abuse of power after Fetterman released non-public records that showed Cox was arrested in 2004.[25] Braddock Solicitor Lawrence Shields agreed that Fetterman's conduct constituted \"an abuse of his mayoral authority\" and violated the Pennsylvania Criminal History Record Information Act.[26] Fetterman defeated Cox in the primary by a vote of 294 to 103[25] and was unopposed in the general election. Fetterman handily won the Democratic primaries in 2013 and 2017, and was unopposed in the general elections.[27]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nFetterman served as the part-time mayor of Braddock and the full-time director of the city's youth program.[28] He also founded a nonprofit organization, Braddock Redux, which he used to acquire and save properties in Braddock.[29]\n\n\nFetterman's father helped subsidize Fetterman financially because the position of mayor paid only $150 per month.[8] He received payments of $54,000 from his father in 2015.[15] Fetterman has several tattoos related to the Braddock community. On his left arm are the numbers 15104\u2014Braddock's ZIP Code\u2014and on the right are the dates of nine murders that occurred in the town while he was mayor.[30]\n\n\nAfter his first election, one of Fetterman's first acts was to set up a website for Braddock showing the town's mostly neglected and destroyed buildings.[31] As mayor, Fetterman initiated youth and art programs and worked to develop the town's abandoned buildings and improve the poor economy. With family money, he purchased the town's First Presbyterian Church for $50,000 and lived in its basement for several months.[32] The church was later turned into the town's community center.[31] Fetterman later purchased an adjacent warehouse for $2,000, placed two shipping containers on the roof for extra living space, and moved in.[28] He worked to convert vacant lots into parks and gardens, build the town's first public basketball court, and establish a two-acre organic urban farm, worked by teenagers of the Braddock Youth Project.[33][34] To help fund programs, Fetterman established relationships with local nonprofit organizations, Allegheny County's economic development program, and then-county executive Dan Onorato.[34] For example, Fetterman helped secure a $400,000 grant from the Heinz Foundation toward the building of a green roof, which provided 100 summer construction jobs for local youth.[35]\n\n\nFetterman pitched Braddock to people around the country as a place to move due to the town's low real estate prices.[31] The town has attracted people from cities such as Chicago and Portland, Oregon, drawn by the potential for growth.[31] Inspired by Fetterman's call, a group of Brooklyn residents moved to Braddock and transformed an abandoned church into an art center.[36] But Braddock's redevelopment raised concerns about gentrification.[11][33] Despite Fetterman's attempts to attract new residents to Braddock, the population continued to hover around 2,000, and even though the town's real estate was cheap, many of the homes were condemned or uninhabitable.[37][38]\n\n\nBraddock mayors hold administrative power over the Braddock Police Department,[35] but Fetterman delegated that power to Braddock Police Chief Frank DeBartolo for the sake of efficiency.[35] Fetterman aimed to improve the relationship between Braddock's residents and the police by serving as a mediator during disputes.[35] During his tenure as mayor, Braddock's homicide rate fell substantially; for five years, there were no gun-related murders in Braddock.[8]\n\n\nIn 2006, Fetterman opposed the expansion of Mon-Fayette Expressway, a partially completed four-lane highway that connects Western Pennsylvania and West Virginia.[33] He argued that the planned expansion of the expressway would cut straight through Braddock and destroy the town.[33]\n\n\nWhile mayor, Fetterman had a contentious relationship with the town council and did not attend many council meetings.[8] In 2009, members of the town council attempted to have him removed from a town council meeting and arrested after he criticized a political opponent while delivering his mayoral report.[35] The same year, council president Jesse Brown ordered Braddock's code enforcement officer to cite Fetterman for an occupancy permit violation for a building owned by Fetterman's nonprofit. A judge later dismissed the complaint.[39] To avoid the town council's gridlock, Fetterman used his nonprofit to accomplish many of his ideas for Braddock; this approach limited citizens' input into the projects.[38]\n\n\nIn November 2010, Fetterman was arrested and immediately released after refusing to leave the property of the U.S. Steel Tower in Pittsburgh while protesting the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center's controversial closure of Braddock Hospital.[40][41] The Braddock Hospital was Braddock's largest employer, and its closure left the town without a healthcare provider.[36]\n\n\nAlso in November 2010, Fetterman took a leading role in trying to close down Club 804, a Braddock nightclub he described as a public nuisance after a shooting occurred there.[42] Two years later, the club renamed itself \"Club Elegance\" and Fetterman unsuccessfully sought to have it shut down for violating Braddock's ordinance regarding acceptable locations for certain sexually oriented businesses.[43]\n\n\nFetterman cast only one vote during his tenure as mayor. In 2012, he voted to help the borough council choose a president.[44]\n\n\nStarting in 2013, Fetterman began defying a 1996 Pennsylvania law that banned same-sex marriage and began to marry LGBT couples inside his home.[45]\n\n\nIn 2013, Fetterman and celebrity chef Kevin Sousa established a restaurant in Braddock, something the town had lacked.[46] He bought a 3,000-square-foot former car dealership, intending to make it the site of the new restaurant. The restaurant was named Superior Motors.[46] The restaurant opened in 2017, but closed in 2021 amid the COVID-19 pandemic.[47] Mayor Charda\u00e9 Jones, Fetterman's successor, criticized the restaurant for closing after only a few years and having received a Paycheck Protection Program loan for $190,000 in 2020.[47]\n\n\n\n#### Shotgun incident[edit]\n\n\nFetterman was criticized for an incident in North Braddock in January 2013 when he heard a sound he thought was gunfire and followed an unarmed jogger, whom he detained with a shotgun.[48] The jogger, Chris Miyares, a black American, said that what Fetterman thought were gunshots were kids shooting bottle rockets. Fetterman said no debris had been found.[49] Miyares claimed that Fetterman pointed the shotgun at his chest while he loaded the gun and then aimed the gun at his face.[48] Fetterman denies that he pointed the gun at Miyares and said he only pointed the gun in a way to show that he was armed and that he \"didn't even have a round chambered or the safety off.\"[48] He said he believed he \"did the right thing\" and has not apologized.[50][48] No charges were brought against either in connection with the incident,[49] and Miyares never filed a formal complaint.[48]\n\n\nThe incident gained new attention during Fetterman's Senate bid, with critics alleging a racial element to the incident.[49][51][50] Fetterman's campaign denied allegations of racism, claiming that Miyares was wearing a black sweatsuit and mask, so Fetterman could not have identified his race or gender.[49][51] Fetterman also added that Miyares was running in the direction of a school and that he made the decision to approach him with the firearm due to the event's proximity in time to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.[49]\n\n\nIn 2021, Miyares wrote that Fetterman had \"lied about everything\" that happened during the incident, but that he had \"done far more good than that one bad act\" and \"should not be defined by it\", and that he hoped Fetterman would win the Senate race.[52]\n\n\n\n#### Media coverage and criticism[edit]\n\n\nFetterman's efforts to create youth-oriented programs, revitalize his town, and attract artists and other \"creatives\" to his community were featured in *The New York Times*.[38] A 2009 article in *The Guardian* called him \"America's coolest mayor\".[53]\n\n\nFetterman appeared on the *Colbert Report* on February 25, 2009, discussing the economic difficulties his town faced due to a decreasing population, plummeting real estate values, and bankruptcy. He also questioned why funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 could not be used to support projects such as those in Braddock.[31]\n\n\nIn 2010, Levi Strauss & Company donated money towards Braddock's revitalization and featured the town in an advertising campaign and documentary produced by the Sundance Channel.[54][55]\n\n\nDuring Fetterman's mayoral tenure, several Braddock residents, including the members of the town council, criticized him for his media appearances that emphasized what they saw as negative aspects of the town.[35] Jesse Brown, Braddock's former town council president, said Fetterman \"needs to tone down his rhetoric about the community and the bad shape the community is in and the devastation of the housing... If he feels that the community is bankrupt, then he needs to go somewhere where he'd like it.\"[35] In 2018, Tony Buba, a Braddock-based filmmaker, said: \"[Fetterman is] this big presence, and everyone thinks he's John Wayne, [but it is] not that simple.\"[37] Buba pointed out that while Fetterman was mayor, Braddock's population had stagnated, and while the average income had grown, it was still only $25,000 per household.[37]\n\n\n\n## Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania (2019\u20132023)[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 2018[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 Pennsylvania gubernatorial election \u00a7\u00a0Lieutenant Governor\n\nOn November 14, 2017, Fetterman announced that he would run for the Democratic nomination for lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania, challenging, among others, incumbent lieutenant governor Mike Stack.[56] Stack was seen as a vulnerable incumbent after the Pennsylvania inspector general launched an investigation into Stack regarding allegations that he mistreated his staff and Pennsylvania state troopers.[57] Fetterman was endorsed by Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, Pittsburgh mayor Bill Peduto and former Pennsylvania governor and Philadelphia mayor Ed Rendell.[37][56][58]\n\n\nOn May 15, Fetterman won the Democratic primary for lieutenant governor with 38% of the vote.[59] Fetterman was a part of the Democratic ticket along with incumbent governor Tom Wolf. On November 6, 2018, Wolf and Fetterman defeated the Republican ticket of Scott Wagner and Jeff Bartos in the general election.[60][61]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fetterman being sworn in as Lieutenant Governor in 2019 in the Pennsylvania State Senate chamber.\nFetterman was sworn into office as the lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania on January 15, 2019, replacing Mike Stack.[62] One the first tasks Governor Tom Wolf gave him was to look into legalizing marijuana statewide.[62] Fetterman went on a statewide tour, visiting all 67 Pennsylvania counties, and spoke to residents about legalization.[63] After completing his tour, he published a report on his findings.\n\n![](image)Official portrait, 2019In a show of support for marijuana legalization and the LGBTQ+ community, Fetterman hung the pride flag and a flag with a marijuana leaf from his office's balcony, which overlooks the state capitol.[64] State employees removed them when an omnibus bill, signed into law by Wolf, banned unauthorized flags on capitol property. Fetterman continued to defy the law by flying the flags outside his office.[64]\n\n\nAn Associated Press review of Fetterman's daily schedule during his tenure as lieutenant governor found that he kept a light work schedule and was often absent from official state business.[65] From his inauguration in January 2019 until May 2022, Fetterman's official schedule was blank for one-third of workdays.[65] Additionally, the days that he worked were often short, ranging from four to five hours.[65] He was often absent from presiding over the Pennsylvania State Senate, an official duty of the lieutenant governor. In 2020, he attended only half of the Senate's sessions; in 2021, he attended only a third of them.[65]\n\n\n\n#### Board of Pardons[edit]\n\n\nThe lieutenant governor has very little actual power, but does oversee the Pennsylvania Board of Pardons. In this position, Fetterman worked to increase commutations and pardons for those serving jail time in Pennsylvania.[66] *The Philadelphia Inquirer* reported that Fetterman ran the Board of Pardons \"with the heart of an activist and, at times, the force of a bully\".[66] *The Inquirer* also reported that he threatened to run against Attorney General Josh Shapiro (who, at the time, was planning a run for governor) unless Shapiro supported more pardons.[66]\n\n\nWhile chaired by Fetterman, the Board of Pardons recommended 50 commutations for life sentences, and Governor Wolf granted 47 commutations.[67] As lieutenant governor, Fetterman announced \"a coordinated effort for a one-time, large-scale pardoning project for people with select minor, nonviolent marijuana criminal convictions\".[67]\n\n\n\n#### Donald Trump[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fetterman as lieutenant governor in 2022\nIn November 2020, Fetterman received national press coverage for saying Donald Trump was \"no different than any other random internet troll\"[68] and that he \"can sue a ham sandwich\" in response to Trump threatening to file lawsuits in Pennsylvania alleging voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election.[69]\n\n\nJoe Biden won the 2020 presidential election in Pennsylvania, defeating Trump by more than 81,000 votes.[70] Trump's claims of voter fraud led to a challenge of the results, and Texas attorney general Ken Paxton filed suit to overturn the election results in Pennsylvania and other states.[71] Supporting that effort, Texas lieutenant governor Dan Patrick offered a reward of $1,000,000 to anyone who could prove a case of fraud in the affected states. Fetterman responded by certifying that Pennsylvania had discovered three cases of voter fraud; two men had cast ballots as their dead mothers (both for Trump), and another had voted on behalf of his son as well as himself (also for Trump). Fetterman said that Patrick should pay $1 million for each of these cases. He said he was proud to announce that Trump \"got 100% of the dead mother vote\" in Pennsylvania.[72] Fetterman's lampooning of the alleged voting fraud received nationwide publicity.[72][73]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Senate (2023\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 2016[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2016 United States Senate election in Pennsylvania \u00a7\u00a0Democratic primary\n\n![](image)Fetterman campaigning in Pittsburgh in 2016\nOn September 14, 2015, Fetterman announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate seat held by Pat Toomey in the 2016 election.[74] His campaign was considered a long shot against two better-known candidates, Katie McGinty and Joe Sestak, the 2010 Democratic nominee for Senate.[75] Fetterman was endorsed by former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley,[76] former Pennsylvania treasurer Barbara Hafer,[77] and the PennLive editorial board.[78]\n\n\nFetterman's campaign focused on progressive values and building support through grassroots movement, drawing comparisons to Bernie Sanders.[79] He was the only statewide Democratic candidate in Pennsylvania to endorse Sanders.[80] Though lacking statewide name recognition, low on campaign funds, and polling as low as 4% a week before the primary,[81] Fetterman garnered 20% of the primary vote. Katie McGinty, who spent $4,312,688 on the primary and was endorsed by Barack Obama and many U.S. senators, finished ahead of former congressman and admiral Joe Sestak, who raised $5,064,849, with Fetterman raising $798,981 and finishing third.[82][83] After the primary, Fetterman campaigned on behalf of McGinty,[84] who lost to Toomey in the general election.\n\n\n\n#### 2022[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 United States Senate election in Pennsylvania\n\n![](image)Fetterman's 2022 U.S. Senate campaign logo\nIn January 2021, Fetterman announced he was launching an exploratory committee for the 2022 U.S. Senate election in Pennsylvania.[85][86] On February 4, 2021, Fetterman filed a statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission declaring his intention to run for the Senate seat being vacated by Toomey.[87][88] On February 8, 2021, he officially entered the race.[89]\n\n\n\n##### Democratic primary[edit]\n\n\nFetterman's main opponent in the Democratic primary was U.S. representative Conor Lamb.[90] A political action committee supporting Lamb ran ads attacking Fetterman as \"a self-described democratic socialist\".[90] While the ad cited an NPR article that called Fetterman a socialist, *The Philadelphia Inquirer* wrote, \"Fetterman has never actually described himself that way.\"[90] Both Lamb and another candidate, Malcolm Kenyatta, criticized Fetterman for an incident where he pulled a loaded shotgun on a black jogger whom he believed had fired a gun.[90]\n\n\nWhile leading in many polls, Fetterman received few endorsements in the Democratic primary. State representative John I. Kane said that the lack of endorsements was characteristic of Fetterman's \"lone wolf personality\". Darisha Parker, a state representative from Philadelphia, argued that his lack of endorsements was because he had \"never come and introduced himself to me or any of my colleagues... if a lieutenant governor doesn't take the time to get to talk to somebody like me, then why would we want to send somebody like him to D.C.?\"[91]\n\n\nFetterman won the Democratic primary by a landslide with 58.7% of the vote to Lamb's 26.3%. He won every county including Philadelphia County, but struggled to win much of the city's black vote\u2014capturing just 18% of the vote in the majority-black precincts.[92][93] Fetterman's wife Gisele gave a victory speech on her husband's behalf, as he was hospitalized following a stroke.[94]\n\n\n\n#### General election[edit]\n\n\nIn the general election, Fetterman faced Republican nominee Mehmet Oz, a celebrity television doctor. According to *The Philadelphia Citizen*, Fetterman employed a social media campaign strategy consisting of shitposting and internet memes.[95] *The Daily Beast* reported that Oz's New Jersey residency, net worth, and connections to Donald Trump were the focus of many of the memes.[96] Criticizing Oz's previous residency in New Jersey became a particular hallmark of Fetterman's campaign, seeking to label Oz a carpetbagger. Efforts by the campaign to highlight Oz's New Jersey ties included enlisting New Jersey celebrities Snooki and Steven Van Zandt to record video messages aimed at Oz,[97][98] and having a plane banner fly over the Jersey Shore reading \"Hey Dr. Oz: Welcome home to N.J.! \u2764\ufe0f John.\"[99]\n\n\nFetterman's health was also a major issue in the campaign because he had suffered a stroke days before his primary victory.[100]\n\n\nAt an August 2022 rally in Erie, Fetterman appeared in public for the first time since recovering from his stroke; according to *Politico*, he \"appeared physically healthy and mostly talked without any issues. At times, however, his speech was somewhat halted.\"[97] In October 2022, he gave his first in-person interview since the stroke, with Dasha Burns, on *NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt*.[101] As a result of his stroke, Fetterman required closed-captioning technology to read the questions as they were being asked out loud.[101] Burns said that in their uncaptioned conversation before the interview, she was uncertain whether he could understand her.[102] This drew criticism from other reporters, who said Fetterman did not exhibit such difficulty in other interviews.[103]\n\n\nIn September 2022, Oz called on Fetterman to debate him before early voting began in Pennsylvania on September 19.[104] Fetterman agreed to debate Oz in \"the middle to end of October\" but did not commit to an exact date or to a debate in September.[105] Oz and Toomey criticized Fetterman's approach to the debate.[106] *The Washington Post* wrote that it \"raised questions about whether [Fetterman], still recovering from a serious stroke, is fit to serve in the Senate\".[107] On September 15, Oz and Fetterman agreed to a single debate on October 25.[108]\n\n\n*Politico* reported that Fetterman struggled during the debate \"to effectively communicate\u2014missing words, pausing awkwardly and speaking haltingly\",[109][110] while *The New York Times* reported that \"he was also fluent enough over the course of the hour to present his Democratic vision for a state that could determine control of the Senate\".[111] According to the *Times*, Fetterman was an uneven debater even before his stroke.[112] Republicans seized on his appearances and behavior after the stroke to suggest that he was not fit for office; according to medical experts, speech impairment after a stroke does not indicate cognitive impairment.[113] Senator Chris Coons said that the debate \"was hard to watch\" but that Pennsylvanians would still be attracted to Fetterman's candidacy because of his \"record of what he's done in Braddock [and] as lieutenant governor\".[114]\n\n\nAlthough Fetterman led most pre-election polls, his debate performance and concerns about his health helped Oz take a narrow lead before the election.[115][116][117]\n\n\nOn November 9, media outlets projected Fetterman as the winner of the election.[118][119][120] Fetterman won the election with 51.3% of the vote to Oz's 46.3%.[121]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nFetterman took office on January 3, 2023.[122] At 6 feet 8 inches tall, he is the tallest currently serving senator.[123]\n\n\nAccording to *The New York Times*, Fetterman's adjustment to the Senate has been \"extraordinarily challenging\u2014even with the [extensive] accommodations that have been made to help him adapt\".[124] To assist with Fetterman's stroke-related speech processing issues, the Senate chamber was outfitted with closed captioning technology at his desk and at the front of the chamber.[125]\n\n\nIn February 2023, Fetterman attended his first Agriculture Committee hearing.[126] He asked questions about trade and organic farming, but stumbled slightly over his words.[126]\n\n\nFetterman was hospitalized for syncope (lightheadedness) for two days beginning on February 10, 2023.[127] Two days after his release he was hospitalized again, for a severe case of major depression. For about two months, Fetterman lived and worked at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center.[128] As part of his daily schedule at the hospital, his chief of staff arrived at 10 a.m. on weekdays with newspaper clips, statements for Fetterman to approve, and legislation to review.[128] During his hospitalization, Fetterman co-sponsored a bipartisan rail safety bill, introduced after the derailment of a chemical-carrying train in East Palestine, Ohio, close to the border with Pennsylvania; the regulation aimed to strengthen freight-rail safety regulations to prevent future derailments.[128][129]\n\n\nOn April 17, 2023, Fetterman returned to the Senate to chair the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry subcommittee on food and nutrition, specialty crops, organics and research.[130] *The Washington Post* said that Fetterman's \"voice stumbled at times while reading from prepared notes\" during the subcommittee hearing, but \"he appeared in good spirits\" and communicated a message about the importance of fighting hunger.[131]\n\n\n\n#### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n* Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry\n* Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs\n* Committee on Environment and Public Works\n* Joint Economic Committee\n* Special Committee on Aging**[132]**\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fetterman delivering his inaugural address as lieutenant governor in 2019\nFetterman is often described as a social and fiscal progressive, including by himself.[8][133] When running for Senate in 2022, Fetterman said that he is not a progressive and is \"just a Democrat\", explaining that many parts of his platform that were once considered progressive are now mainstream beliefs of the party.[134] In 2022, *The New York Times* characterized Fetterman as \"left-leaning\".[135] Fordham University political science professor Christina Greer described Fetterman, alongside New York City Mayor Eric Adams, as \"simultaneously progressive, moderate and conservative\".[136]\n\n\n\n### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nIn a Democratic primary debate in May 2022, Fetterman said regarding abortion: \"That is between a woman and her physician\". To the question if any exceptions exist, he said: \"It's certainly not between me or any politician. We settled this decades ago, and the fact that these states are trying to repeal it... we have to push back on that.\"[137] Later that month, Fetterman reiterated his position opposing any legal restrictions on abortion, including in the third trimester.[138]\n\n\n\n### Congressional stock ownership[edit]\n\n\nFetterman supports barring members of Congress and their immediate families from trading or holding stocks.[139]\n\n\n\n### Criminal justice reform[edit]\n\n\nPrison reform is one of Fetterman's signature issues, advocating for more rehabilitation action as well as clemency for model prisoners. As part of his role as lieutenant governor, he served as the chair of Pennsylvania's Board of Pardons, which processes clemency requests and forwards them to the governor. Fetterman urged the board to process requests more quickly.[140]\n\n\nFetterman is in favor of abolishing capital punishment in Pennsylvania, stating that he \"wholly support[s] Governor Tom Wolf's moratorium on the death penalty\". He has called the death penalty \"inhumane, antiquated, expensive, and [a] flawed system of punishment\".[141]\n\n\nFetterman supports the elimination of mandatory sentences of life in prison without the possibility of parole for second degree murder, in which someone commits a felony resulting in death, but is not directly responsible for the killing. He does not support eliminating life without parole as a sentence.[142][143][144] His Senate race opponent, Mehmet Oz, claimed that Fetterman supports \"eliminat[ing] life sentences for murderers\", which PolitiFact and other fact-checking outlets called a distortion of Fetterman's position.[145][143]\n\n\n\n### Environmental issues[edit]\n\n\nPreviously, Fetterman opposed fracking, calling the practice \"an environmental abomination\".[146] He has since shifted his stance on the issue, saying that he supports permitting fracking, although he advocates for stricter environmental regulations.[140] Fetterman says there needs to be a balance between decarbonization efforts and creating jobs in the fossil fuel industry. While running for lieutenant governor, he supported establishing two new fracking wells.[37] In 2021, Fetterman said that he supports moving towards a \"de facto moratorium [on fracking] because the transition is going to be toward green and renewable energy\".[147] In February 2021, he told MSNBC, \"I'm embracing what the green ideal considers a priority. Like, you know, the Green New Deal isn't a specific piece of legislation. What I am in support of is acknowledging that the climate crisis is absolutely real.\"[148]\n\n\n\n### Filibuster[edit]\n\n\nFetterman supports ending the filibuster in the United States Senate.[149] He has also said that Democrats need to be more ruthless, like Republicans, in order to pass legislative priorities.[150]\n\n\n\n### Foreign policy[edit]\n\n\nIn 2015, *The Patriot-News* described Fetterman as a \"skeptic of free trade\", given his opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and a non-interventionist. Fetterman has said that the United States should not \"be considered the world's police officers\".[11]\n\n\n\n#### Israel[edit]\n\n\nFetterman is a strong supporter of Israel\u2013United States relations and said as a U.S. senator, he will \"lean in\" on the \"relationship between the United States and Israel\". He said that the U.S.\u2013Israel relationship \"is a special one that needs to be safeguarded, protected, supported and nurtured through legislation and all available diplomatic efforts in the region\". He supports United States foreign aid to Israel, including Iron Dome funding. Fetterman criticized congressional Democrats who voted against Iron Dome funding, calling them \"fringe\" and \"extreme\". He has said he supports Israel's right to defend itself and is \"passionate\" in his opposition to the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement. He supported a law signed by Pennsylvania governor Tom Wolf that barred Pennsylvania from entering into contracts with companies that boycott Israel. He supports a two-state solution and the expansion of the Abraham Accords, the Arab-Israeli agreements brokered under the Trump administration.[151]\n\n\n\n#### NATO[edit]\n\n\nIn 2023, Fetterman voted against an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that would have clarified that Article 5 of the NATO treaty does not obviate the need for Congress to declare war.[152][153]\n\n\nFetterman voted for Tim Kaine's amendment, which prohibits the president of the United States from withdrawing from NATO without congressional approval.[154][155]\n\n\n\n### Gun policy[edit]\n\n\nFetterman supports greater restrictions on gun purchases.[156]\n\n\n\n### Healthcare[edit]\n\n\nFetterman has described himself as a supporter of Medicare for All, saying that healthcare is a \"fundamental human need and right\".[133] Fetterman's website states that \"Healthcare is a fundamental human right,\"[157] and that he would \"support whatever path\" is necessary to expand healthcare accessibility including the expansion of Obamacare.[158] In debate, he reaffirmed he would vote for Medicare for All.[159]\n\n\n\n### Marijuana[edit]\n\n\nFetterman is a proponent of legalizing marijuana, calling the issue a \"political bazooka\" and that leaving the issue alone is giving an opportunity for another party to gain political support for a pro\u2013marijuana legalization agenda. He argued that if conservative South Dakota voters were willing to approve a ballot measure legalizing recreational marijuana, Pennsylvania should legalize it too.[160] He also supports expunging criminal convictions related to marijuana.[161]\n\n\n\n### Minimum wage[edit]\n\n\nFetterman supports raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour.[133]\n\n\n\n### Policing[edit]\n\n\nFetterman has described himself as \"pro-policing\", including pro-community policing. He opposes defunding the police, calling the movement \"absurd\",[146] but supports the Black Lives Matter movement.[162][163] After Derek Chauvin, a police officer who murdered an unarmed black man, George Floyd, was convicted of second-degree murder, Fetterman tweeted his support for the verdict, stating that Chauvin was \"clearly guilty\".[164]\n\n\nAs lieutenant governor, Fetterman supported legislation that would allow the police to use deadly force only in situations where officers or others nearby face imminent threat of death or serious injury.[165]\n\n\n\n### Taxation[edit]\n\n\nFetterman supports implementing a wealth tax in the United States.[166] He has said those \"who have yachts\" could be used as a potential benchmark.[167]\n\n\n\n### Unions[edit]\n\n\nFetterman is a supporter of labor unions, saying \"The union way of life is sacred\". He is a supporter of the PRO Act.[168]\n\n\n\n### Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023[edit]\n\n\nFetterman was among the five Senate Democrats who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023.[169]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fetterman and his wife Gisele Barreto Fetterman in 2019\nFetterman is married to Gisele Barreto Fetterman (n\u00e9e\u00a0Almeida), a Brazilian-American activist. Almeida, who was once an undocumented immigrant and a resident of Newark, New Jersey, heard about Fetterman's work as mayor of Braddock and wrote him a letter in 2007.[37] Fetterman invited Almeida to visit Braddock, and a year later they were married.[37] The couple has three children and they live in a converted car dealership[170] with their rescue dogs, Levi and Artie. The family chose to not live in State House, the official residence for Pennsylvania's lieutenant governor.[171]\n\n\nIn 2008, Allegheny County sued Fetterman and his nonprofit Braddock Redux for unpaid taxes. A tax lien was placed against Fetterman and his nonprofit for $25,000. In 2012, Fetterman paid off the unpaid taxes.[172]\n\n\nIn fall 2020, Gisele Fetterman shared a photo of the family's home while John was being interviewed. Levi's humorous facial expression resulted in the photograph going viral. The next day, an unconnected fan of Levi created a Twitter account in his name and became friends with Gisele Fetterman, but remains anonymous.[173] Levi and Artie have their own Twitter account with more than 25,000 followers.[174] Levi is a mixed-breed dog and was featured in the CW's television special \"Dogs of the Year 2021\".[173][175] In July 2021, the *York Daily Record* reported that Levi was an advocate for the increase of the state license fee for dog owners to fund the Pennsylvania bureau tasked with canine law enforcement, such as dealing with dangerous dogs and exposing puppy mills.[176]\n\n\nFetterman is known for his casual style of dress. He is often seen wearing a sweatshirt and shorts,[8] and long owned only one suit, which he wore when presiding over the Pennsylvania Senate, where there is a dress code.[8] Fetterman purchased a new suit for his swearing-in as a U.S. senator.[177]\n\n\nIn March 2023, right-wing conspiracy theorists spread a false theory that Fetterman had been replaced by a body double.[178]\n\n\n*The Philadelphia Inquirer* reported that Fetterman has a net worth between $717,000 and $1.58 million.[15]\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nAccording to Fetterman's Chief of Staff, Adam Jentleson, Fetterman has struggled with depression throughout his life.[179]\n\n\nIn 2017, Fetterman's feet suddenly began to swell and he was subsequently hospitalized for testing.[180] At that time, he was diagnosed by cardiologist Ramesh Chandra with \"atrial fibrillation, an irregular heart rhythm, along with a decreased heart pump\", although this diagnosis was not known publicly until Fetterman's stroke in May 2022.[181]\n\n\nIn 2018, Fetterman spoke publicly about his substantial weight loss. Fetterman, who is 6 foot 8 inches tall (2.06\u00a0m), had weighed more than 400 pounds (180\u00a0kg) before losing approximately 150 pounds (70\u00a0kg).[180][182][183]\n\n\nOn June 4, 2019, *The Philadelphia Inquirer* reported that Fetterman \"collapsed\" while presiding over the State Senate; he became wobbly and grabbed the lectern to prevent himself from falling over, and a member of the Capitol's nursing staff came to examine him.[184][185] Afterward, Fetterman's spokesperson said he had become overheated and was \"back to normal\".[185]\n\n\nOn May 13, 2022, Fetterman had an ischemic stroke and was hospitalized. The stroke was induced by a clot caused by atrial fibrillation (irregular heart rhythm). Because Fetterman also had cardiomyopathy, his doctors implanted a pacemaker and defibrillator. He was discharged from the hospital on May 22, 2022.[186][187][188]\n\n\nIn an early June 2022 letter, Chandra wrote that Fetterman was \"well compensated and stable\" and that \"If he takes his medications, eats healthy and exercises, he'll be fine.\"[189] His doctors reported that Fetterman did not sustain cognitive damage, and that they expected a full recovery.[188][190] Fetterman expressed regret for having ignored his health; after the 2017 diagnosis with atrial fibrillation, he did not see a doctor for five years and did not continue medications.[189][191][192]\n\n\nIn an October 2022 letter providing a medical update, Fetterman's primary care physician said that he \"spoke intelligently without cognitive deficits\" during examination and had significantly improved communication compared to his first visit with the doctor.[193][194] Fetterman's stroke left him with symptoms of an auditory processing disorder, and he uses closed captioning as an aid to read speech in real time.[195][196][197] The physician noted that Fetterman regularly attends speech therapy, routinely exercises, takes appropriate heart medications, and \"has no work restrictions and can work full duty in public office.\"[193][194]\n\n\nOn February 8, 2023, Fetterman was hospitalized overnight after feeling lightheaded during a U.S. Senate retreat earlier that day. His office reported that he was in \"good spirits and talking with his staff and family\", and that his hospitalization was unrelated to his stroke.[198] On February 16, 2023, Fetterman checked himself into Walter Reed Hospital due to clinical depression.[179] A senior aide later said Fetterman would remain hospitalized for \"likely less than two months\" while he underwent treatment.[199] Fetterman was discharged from Walter Reed on March 31.[200] He returned to the Senate on April 17 and chaired an Agriculture Committee subcommittee to discuss Pennsylvania's farm issues.[130]\n\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\nFetterman made a cameo appearance in the 2022 film *The Pale Blue Eye*. In December 2022, he posted a photo of himself and his wife alongside actor Christian Bale on the set of the film. Fetterman also worked with Bale and the film's director, Scott Cooper, in 2013, when they filmed *Out of the Furnace* in Braddock.[201]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n\n\nBraddock mayoral election, 2005 Democratic primary[202]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic** | **John Fetterman**  | **149**  | **35.06%**  |\n|  | Democratic | Virginia Bunn\n | 148\n | 34.82%\n |\n|  | Democratic | Pauline Abdullah (incumbent)\n | 128\n | 30.12%\n |\n| Total votes\n | **425**  | **100.0%**  |\n\n\n\n\nBraddock mayoral election, 2005 general election[203]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic** | **John Fetterman**  | **288**  | **100.00%**  |\n| Total votes\n | **288**  | **100.0%**  |\n|  | Democratic **hold** |\n\n\n\n\nBraddock mayoral election, 2009 Democratic primary[204]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic** | **John Fetterman (incumbent)**  | **304**  | **65.38%**  |\n|  | Democratic | Jayme J.

He played college football at Michigan.[1] While there, Henne became only the second freshman starting quarterback in Michigan history, accumulated a total of 32 wins in regular season play, 8,740 offensive yards, and 87 touchdowns, and in his senior season led the Wolverines to a Capital One Bowl victory over Florida. He was subsequently named as the game's MVP after throwing for over 350 yards.[2]\n\n\nHenne's professional career began when he was drafted by the Miami Dolphins in the second round of the 2008 NFL Draft. Henne spent most of his rookie season on the bench as the back-up to veteran quarterback Chad Pennington. In his second season with the Dolphins, Henne started the majority of the 2009 season after Pennington was unable to play due to an injury.[1] Henne would go on to act as a starter for several seasons for both the Dolphins and Jacksonville Jaguars, before serving as a backup for the Jaguars. In 2018 he signed with the Kansas City Chiefs serving as a backup as well, winning two Super Bowls with the team.\n\n\n\n\n## High school career[edit]\n\n\nHenne moved into the Wilson School District prior to the start of his 3rd grade year in 1994.[3] He played in 43 scholastic games for the Bulldogs (42 starts) over four seasons, earning a record of 33\u201310. His Wilson football teams won two Lancaster-Lebanon League Section 1 titles, the first his freshman year (2000[4]) and the second his junior season (2002). Henne's third scholastic year was his most successful, both individually and as a team. His 2002 Wilson Bulldogs squad finished their regular season undefeated with a record of 10\u20130 and were the 2002 PIAA District 3 AAAA runner-up, falling to Central Dauphin in a thrilling championship game.[5] He amassed 7,071 passing yards in his high school career, which was fourth-most all-time in PIAA history (and first in PIAA District 3) at the conclusion of the Henne's senior season in the fall of 2003, behind John Veach (Mount Carmel Area), Evan Kraky (Lakeland), and Ron Powlus (Berwick).[*citation needed*] Henne owns three significant Wilson football program records (as of February 2020): career passing yardage (7,071); career passing touchdowns (74), and most touchdown passes in a game (5; tied). He was named to the Pennsylvania All-State Football Team as a senior in 2003, selected to participate in the 47th Annual Big 33 Football Classic in July 2004,[6] was named the Pennsylvania Football Gatorade Player of the Year for 2003\u20132004,[7] and earned national recognition as a member of the 2003\u20132004 Parade High School All-American Football Team.[8] In October 2014, Henne was inducted into the Wilson High School Athletic Hall of Fame.[9] In addition to his football accomplishments, Henne was also a member of the Wilson varsity basketball team for three years as well as an outstanding athlete for the Bulldogs track and field team, finishing as the PIAA runner-up in the javelin as a senior[10][11] after finishing first at the District 3 meet[12] two weeks earlier. Henne aspires to become a coach at his alma mater following his lengthy NFL career.\n\n\nIn 2000, his freshman season at Wilson Senior High School in West Lawn, Pennsylvania, Henne played QB in all 11 of Wilson's games, with 10 starts. He rotated at QB with junior Ian Firestone in the Week 1 storm-delayed win vs Harrisburg but would start the final 10 games for the Bulldogs and play the majority of the positional snaps.[4] Henne led come-from-behind victories against Wilson's first three opponents \u2013 Harrisburg, Stroudsburg, and Boyertown \u2013 before a setback at Cedar Crest to open League play. Henne's Wilson team would win their next six contests, including a thrilling comeback victory at Reading, before falling in the 2000 District 3 AAAA semifinals to eventual champion Cumberland Valley, 21\u20137.[4] His freshman season was an overwhelming success, with the team finishing 9\u20132 and earning a share of the Lancaster-Lebanon League Section 1 title (with Cedar Crest and Reading).\n\n\nHenne's Wilson football team would struggle during his second campaign as a starter. The Bulldogs ended their season with an overall record of 6\u20134 and suffered three consecutive losses for the first time since the 1988 season.[3]\n\n\nAt the end of his junior year in 2002, having been offered forty scholarships from various collegiate athletic programs, Henne narrowed his college options down to five schools: Miami, Michigan, Georgia, Tennessee, and Penn State.[13]\n\n\nBefore his first game as a senior, Henne announced his plans to become a Wolverine at the University of Michigan. He was named to the preseason Pennsylvania All-State Football First-team.[14] Following high school, Henne played in the 2004 U.S. Army All-American Bowl as a member of the East team.[15]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\nIn 2004, Henne entered the season as a freshman for the Wolverines, and third on the depth chart behind redshirt sophomore Matt Gutierrez and redshirt freshman quarterback Clayton Richard. The Monday prior to the season opener against the Miami RedHawks, Michigan head coach Lloyd Carr announced Gutierrez would start even though he was suffering from a sore shoulder. A few days later, Carr decided to allow Henne to start in relief of Gutierrez.[16]\n\n\nHenne ended his first career game with a 43\u201310 win, completing 14 of 24 passes for 142 yards, two touchdowns, and one interception.[17] Henne was just the second true freshman in Michigan history to start on opening day, a feat not seen at Michigan since Rick Leach in 1975.[18]\n\n\nAlongside freshman running back Mike Hart, he galvanized an explosive offensive unit that featured receivers Braylon Edwards, Jason Avant, and Steve Breaston. All five would later go on to the NFL. Henne's freshman season was highlighted by a triple-overtime win over in-state rival Michigan State[19][20] and a record-tying performance in the Rose Bowl against Texas.[21][22] He also tied the Michigan season record for touchdown passes with 25, first set by Elvis Grbac in 1991.[23]\n\n\n\n![](image)2006 Michigan Wolverines football team huddle with #86 Mario Manningham, #7 Henne, #16 Adrian Arrington, #72 Rueben Riley, #54 Mark Bihl, #77 Jake Long\nHenne was criticized in 2005 after Michigan, ranked in the top five of the preseason polls, stumbled to a 3\u20133 start.[24] The sophomore quarterback was particularly scrutinized after his performance in a close loss to Notre Dame, in which he completed fewer than half of his pass attempts and lost a fumble on the goal line.[25] After their 3\u20133 start, Michigan won four consecutive games to clinch the program's 21st consecutive winning season.[26]\n\n\nAs a junior in 2006, Henne earned Rivals.com All-American third-team honors. He was a Manning Award finalist, Maxwell Award semifinalist, Davey O'Brien Award semifinalist, and Walter Camp Award candidate. The All-Big Ten Conference second-team choice started all thirteen games. He hit on 203-of-328 passes for 2,508 yards and 22 touchdowns with eight interceptions, ranking fifth in Michigan's season record list for touchdown passes, eighth in attempts and completions and tenth in passing yards.[27] For the third straight year Michigan concluded their season by losing to Ohio State and then dropping their bowl game, this time to Southern California.[23][28]\n\n\nDuring his senior year in 2007, Henne completed 162 of 278 passes for 1,938 yards, 17 touchdowns, and nine interceptions.[29] The first game of the season ended in disaster for Michigan, a loss to Appalachian State that was considered one of the biggest sports upsets of all time.[30] In the following game Henne suffered a knee injury in the first half against Oregon, and sat out the second half, as well as subsequent games against Notre Dame and Penn State, before returning to the starting lineup against Northwestern.[31][32] In the final regular season game, Michigan fell to Ohio State 14\u20133, completing an 0\u20134 career record for Henne and fellow seniors Mike Hart and Jake Long against the Buckeyes.[33] Henne played his final collegiate game against Florida in the Capital One Bowl. Henne was named the MVP of the game after he led his team to a 41\u201335 victory over the Gators and reigning Heisman Trophy winner, Tim Tebow.[34]\n\n\nFor his collegiate career, Henne completed 828 of 1,387 passes for 9,715 yards, 87 touchdowns, and 37 interceptions.[29][35] All five marks are school records. Henne's passing touchdown total is second in Big Ten Conference history.\n\n\n\n### College statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Season\n | Games\n | Passing\n | Rushing\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP | GS | Cmp | Att | Pct | Yds | Lng | TD | Int | Rtg | Att | Yds | Avg | Lng | TD |\n| 2004 | 12 | 12 | 240 | 399 | 60.2 | 2,743 | 69 | 25 | 12 | 132.6 | 55 | \u2212137 | \u22122.5 | 9 | 2\n |\n| 2005 | 12 | 12 | 223 | 382 | 58.4 | 2,526 | 54 | 23 | 8 | 129.6 | 54 | 25 | 0.5 | 18 | 1\n |\n| 2006 | 13 | 13 | 203 | 328 | 61.9 | 2,508 | 69 | 22 | 8 | 143.4 | 47 | \u221283 | \u22121.8 | 14 | 0\n |\n| 2007 | 10 | 8 | 162 | 278 | 58.3 | 1,938 | 65 | 17 | 9 | 130.5 | 24 | \u2212120 | \u22125.0 | 9 | 0\n |\n| Total | 47 | 45 | 828 | 1,387 | 59.7 | 9,715 | 69 | 87 | 37 | 133.9 | 180 | \u2212315 | \u22121.8 | 18 | 3\n |\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n\n\nPre-draft measurables\n| Height | Weight | Arm length | Hand span | 40-yard dash | 10-yard split | 20-yard split | 20-yard shuttle | Three-cone drill | Vertical jump | Broad jump | Wonderlic |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 6\u00a0ft 2+7\u20448\u00a0in(1.90\u00a0m)\n | 230\u00a0lb(104\u00a0kg)\n | 31+5\u20448\u00a0in(0.80\u00a0m)\n | 9\u00a0in(0.23\u00a0m) | 4.92 s | 1.70 s | 2.81 s | 4.40 s | 7.17 s | 25.5\u00a0in(0.65\u00a0m) | 8\u00a0ft 10\u00a0in(2.69\u00a0m) | 22[36] |\n| All values from NFL Combine[37][38][39] |\n\n\n### Miami Dolphins[edit]\n\n\nHenne was drafted by the Miami Dolphins in the second round (57th overall) of the 2008 NFL Draft. He was the fourth quarterback chosen, following Matt Ryan, Joe Flacco, and Brian Brohm. His left tackle at Michigan, Jake Long, was the first selection of the draft and would again play alongside Henne in Miami.[40][41]\n\n\n\n#### 2008 season[edit]\n\n\nHenne agreed to a four-year, $3.5 million contract with the team on July 26. Out of training camp, Henne earned the backup quarterback role behind starter Chad Pennington. During the second game of the 2008 season, Henne made his NFL debut with 9:42 left; down 31\u20133 against the Arizona Cardinals.[42] Henne spent the remainder of the season on the bench and played in only two other games, both divisional matchups with the New England Patriots.[43]\n\n\n\n![](image)Henne vs. the New York Jets in 2009.\n#### 2009 season[edit]\n\n\nDuring the third game of the 2009 season, in the early third quarter of a road game versus the San Diego Chargers, San Diego linebacker Kevin Burnett knocked Chad Pennington out of the game with a season-ending injury to his shoulder and rotator cuff. Henne came off the bench in relief. Though he led the Dolphins offense to ten points in the final 20 minutes of the game, he also had an interception returned 31 yards for a touchdown by Eric Weddle.[44]\n\n\nHenne made his first career start on October 4, 2009, against the Buffalo Bills at home. Henne went 14\u2013of\u201322 with one touchdown in a 38\u201310 victory, lifting the team to a 1\u20133 record.[45] In his second NFL start, he led the underdog Dolphins to a 31\u201327 win over the New York Jets in a *Monday Night Football* game. He completed 20 out of 26 passes for 241 yards with two touchdowns. This was Henne's second straight win as starter and included a 53-yard touchdown pass to Ted Ginn Jr.[46]\n\n\nHenne consistently improved as the season went on, passing for 335 yards against the New England Patriots in Week 13.[47] In Week 15, Henne passed for 349 yards in a loss to the Tennessee Titans.[48] In Week 16, Henne passed for 322 yards in a loss to the Houston Texans.[49] In Week 17 against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Henne had gained 140 yards on 16\u2013of\u201320 passing with one touchdown and interception, but had to leave the game with an eye injury.[50]\n\n\n\n#### 2010 season[edit]\n\n\nOn November 10, 2010, after a 4\u20134 start to the 2010 season, Henne lost his starting job to Pennington.[51] Pennington had led the Dolphins to an AFC East championship in 2008. On November 14, during the game against the Tennessee Titans, Henne came in relief for Pennington who went out with an apparent shoulder injury. During the third quarter, Henne himself was injured with an apparent knee injury and was replaced by Tyler Thigpen.[52][53] Henne returned to action in Week 12 against the Oakland Raiders winning 33\u201317.[54] In Week 13, Henne went back to his inconsistencies. He completed 16 of 32 passes and throwing 3 picks in a loss to the Browns.[55] The following week, he went 5\u2013of\u201318 for 53 yards and one touchdown in a 10\u20136 win against the New York Jets on an extremely rainy day.[56] In week 15, he faced the Buffalo Bills going 33\u2013of\u201345 for 176 yards with one touchdown and one interception. This came in a loss, which officially eliminated Miami from the playoffs.[57] In Week 16, Henne faced the Detroit Lions and finished with a loss. Henne went 29 of 44 for 278 yards with one touchdown and two interceptions. Henne had two opportunities in the fourth quarter to lead a game-winning drive and a game-tying drive, but poor play calling led to a loss.[58] In the last week of the season against the New England Patriots, Henne went 6\u201316 for 71 yards with an interception.[59] Henne finished the year with 3301 yards along with 15 touchdowns and 19 interceptions.[60]\n\n\nHis job as starter was thought to be in question during the off-season when it was rumored that the Dolphins sought to acquire Kyle Orton from the Denver Broncos. Coupled with the acquisition of Carolina Panthers quarterback Matt Moore and rookie draft pick Pat Devlin, it was unclear if Miami would continue its commitment with Henne. The Orton rumor eventually fizzled and Devlin was waived and signed to the practice squad, leaving Moore and Henne as the two quarterbacks on the active roster. It would later be announced that Henne would have the starting job in 2011.\n\n\n\n#### 2011 season[edit]\n\n\nHenne's 2011 starting campaign began well, throwing for 416 yards and a professional career-best passer rating of 93.6. These improvements were overshadowed by Tom Brady's 517 pass yards and the resulting loss to the New England Patriots. It was the seventh game of all time to have two quarterbacks surpass 400 yards passing.[61] On Sunday October 2, 2011, in a game against the San Diego Chargers, Henne hurt his left shoulder at the end of a run on a broken play on the Dolphins' second possession and did not return.[62] His injury was later revealed to be a dislocated shoulder in his left (non-throwing) arm. Slated to undergo surgery, Henne was placed on injured reserve and missed the remainder of the 2011 season. The Miami Dolphins announced on February 21, 2012, that they would not re-sign Henne, making him a free agent.[63]\n\n\n\n### Jacksonville Jaguars[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Henne handing off to Toby Gerhart\nHenne signed a two-year deal with the Jacksonville Jaguars on March 14, 2012.[64] In the Jaguars Week 11 game against the Texans, Henne came in for an injured Blaine Gabbert and threw for 354 yards and 4 touchdowns.[65] Henne and Steve Young are the only two players in NFL history since the merger to not start the beginning of a game and throw 4 touchdowns without an interception. He started the final six games of the season for the team after an injury to Gabbert.[66] After Gabbert was benched midway through the 2013 season, Henne became the starter for the rest of the season, starting a total of thirteen games. The Jaguars would go on to finish the season with a 4\u201312 record.[67]\n\n\nOn March 7, 2014, Henne signed a two-year, $8 million extension for $4.5 million guaranteed with the Jaguars.[68] Following a disappointing first half in the 2014 home opener in Week 3, Henne was benched in favor of rookie first-round draft pick Blake Bortles. Bortles remained the starter for the rest of the season, leaving Henne as the backup.[69] In 2015, Henne remained the backup for Bortles. He did not see any action in the 2015 season. Henne signed another two-year, $8 million contract extension on February 18, 2016, to remain as the backup to Bortles. Over the next three seasons, he saw action in a total of four games as an alternate.[70] On February 15, 2017, the Jaguars restructured Henne's contract.[71]\n\n\n\n### Kansas City Chiefs[edit]\n\n\nOn March 16, 2018, Henne signed a two-year contract with the Kansas City Chiefs.[72] In the 2018 season, Henne was the backup to Patrick Mahomes.[73] He appeared in one game in the 2018 season, Week 17 against the Oakland Raiders.[74] On September 1, 2019, Henne was placed on injured reserve.[75] He was designated for return from injured reserve on October 23, 2019, and began practicing with the team.[76] On November 2, he was activated off injured reserve.[77] Henne did not play a snap all season but won his first championship when the Chiefs defeated the San Francisco 49ers 31\u201320 in Super Bowl LIV.[78]\n\n\nHenne re-signed with the Chiefs on a two-year contract on March 19, 2020.[79] In Week 7, against the Denver Broncos, he came into the game in relief of Mahomes and scored a rushing touchdown in the 43\u201316 victory.[80] It was his first rushing touchdown since December 2, 2012, against the Buffalo Bills.[81] On December 30, 2020, with the Chiefs locking up the number 1 seed, head coach Andy Reid announced that Henne would start the Chiefs season finale against the Los Angeles Chargers due to them resting their starters.[82] It would be Henne's first start since Week 3 of the 2014 season when he was with the Jaguars. In the game, Henne threw for 218 yards and 2 touchdowns in the 38\u201321 loss.[83] On January 17, 2021, in the Chiefs divisional playoff game against the Cleveland Browns, Henne came into the game in relief of Mahomes in the third quarter after Mahomes left the game with a concussion. Henne threw for only 66 yards and an interception; however, Henne had a 3rd down run late in the 4th quarter that gained 12 yards, which ran critical time off the clock and left the Chiefs inches from a first down. On the subsequent play, his pass to Tyreek Hill led to the first down, allowing the Chiefs to run out the clock and preserve a 22\u201317 victory.[84][85]\n\n\nHenne signed a one-year contract with the Chiefs on March 24, 2022.[86]\n\n\nOn January 21, 2023, Henne replaced an injured Patrick Mahomes and led a team playoff record 98-yard touchdown drive in the AFC Divisional Round victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars.[87][88]\n\n\n\n### Retirement[edit]\n\n\nOn February 12, 2023, after the Chiefs defeated the Eagles in Super Bowl LVII, Henne announced via his Instagram that he would be retiring from the NFL.[89] On September 17, 2023, it was reported that Henne had been offered a contract by the New York Jets after quarterback Aaron Rodgers suffered an Achilles injury earlier in the season; however, Henne declined the offer and reiterated his desire to remain retired from playing professional football.[90][91]\n\n\n\n## NFL career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Legend\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Won the Super Bowl |\n| **Bold** | Career high\n |\n\n\n### Regular season[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | Games\n | Passing\n | Rushing\n | Sacks\n | Fumbles\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP | GS | Record | Cmp | Att | Pct | Yds | Y/A | TD | Int | Rtg | Att | Yds | Avg | TD | Sck | Yds | Fum | Lost |\n| 2008 | MIA | 3 | 0 | \u2014 | 7 | 12 | 58.3 | 67 | 5.6 | 0 | 0 | 74.0 | 0 | 0 | 0.0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n |\n| 2009 | MIA | 14 | 13 | **7\u20136** | 274 | 451 | 60.8 | 2,878 | 6.4 | 12 | 14 | 75.2 | 16 | 32 | 2.0 | **1** | 26 | 176 | 4 | 0\n |\n| 2010 | MIA | **15** | **14** | 6\u20138 | 301 | 490 | 61.4 | **3,301** | 6.7 | **15** | **19** | 75.4 | **35** | 52 | 1.5 | 0 | 30 | 178 | **5** | **2** |\n| 2011 | MIA | 4 | 4 | 0\u20134 | 64 | 112 | 57.1 | 868 | 7.8 | 4 | 4 | 79.0 | 15 | **112** | **7.5** | **1** | 11 | 67 | 1 | 0\n |\n| 2012 | JAX | 10 | 6 | 1\u20135 | 166 | 308 | 53.9 | 2,084 | 6.8 | 11 | 11 | 72.2 | 11 | 53 | 3.4 | **1** | 28 | 169 | 4 | **2** |\n| 2013 | JAX | **15** | 13 | 4\u20139 | **305** | **503** | 60.6 | 3,241 | 6.4 | 13 | 14 | 76.5 | 27 | 77 | 2.9 | 0 | **38** | **243** | 2 | 0\n |\n| 2014 | JAX | 3 | 3 | 0\u20133 | 42 | 78 | 53.8 | 492 | 6.3 | 3 | 1 | 80.7 | 4 | 25 | 6.3 | 0 | 16 | 105 | 1 | 1\n |\n| 2015 | JAX | 0 | 0 | \u2014 | DNP |\n| 2016 | JAX | 1 | 0 | \u2014 | 0 | 0 | \u2014 | 0 | \u2014 | 0 | 0 | \u2014 | 1 | \u22122 | \u22122.0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n |\n| 2017 | JAX | 2 | 0 | \u2014 | 0 | 2 | 0.0 | 0 | 0.0 | 0 | 0 | 39.6 | 5 | \u22125 | \u22121.0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n |\n| 2018 | KC | 1 | 0 | \u2014 | 2 | 3 | 66.7 | 29 | **9.7** | 0 | 0 | 97.9 | 1 | 3 | 3.0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n |\n| 2019 | KC | 0 | 0 | \u2014 | DNP |\n| 2020 | KC | 3 | 1 | 0\u20131 | 28 | 38 | **73.7** | 248 | 6.5 | 2 | 0 | **108.2** | 7 | \u20132 | \u22120.3 | **1** | 2 | 4 | 2 | 0\n |\n| 2021 | KC | 4 | 0 | \u2014 | 11 | 16 | 68.8 | 82 | 5.1 | 0 | 0 | 80.7 | 8 | 0 | 0.0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n |\n| 2022 | KC | 3 | 0 | \u2014 | 0 | 2 | 0.0 | 0 | 0.0 | 0 | 0 | 39.6 | 5 | \u22125 | \u22121.0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0\n |\n| Career | 78 | 54 | 18\u201336 | 1,200 | 2,015 | 59.6 | 13,290 | 6.6 | 60 | 63 | 76.1 | 143 | 351 | 2.5 | 4 | 151 | 942 | 20 | 5\n |\n\n\n### Postseason[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | Games\n | Passing\n | Rushing\n | Sacks\n | Fumbles\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP | GS | Record | Cmp | Att | Pct | Yds | Y/A | TD | Int | Rtg | Att | Yds | Avg | TD | Sck | Yds | Fum | Lost |\n| 2008 | MIA | 0 | 0 | \u2014 | DNP |\n| 2017 | JAX | 0 | 0 | \u2014\n |\n| 2019 | KC | 0 | 0 | \u2014\n |\n| 2020 | KC | 1 | 0 | \u2014 | 6 | 8 | 75.0 | 66 | 8.3 | 0 | 1 | 59.4 | 2 | 12 | 6.0 | 0 | 1 | 6 | 0 | 0\n |\n| 2021 | KC | 0 | 0 | \u2014 | DNP |\n| 2022 | KC | 1 | 0 | \u2014 | 5 | 7 | 71.0 | 23 | 3.3 | 1 | 0 | 114.9 | 1 | \u20131 | \u22121.0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n |\n| Career | 2 | 0 | \u2014 | 11 | 15 | 73.3 | 89 | 5.9 | 1 | 1 | 82.4 | 3 | 11 | 3.7 | 0 | 1 | 6 | 0 | 0\n |\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nOn July 3, 2010, Henne married Brittany Hartman in Perkasie, Pennsylvania.[92]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Lists of Michigan Wolverines football passing leaders\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Chad Henne - Miami Dolphins\". *Miami Dolphins*.

He has discovered microfossil records of early life in Spitsbergen, East Greenland, Siberia, China, Namibia, western North America, and Australia,[1] and was among the first to apply principles of taphonomy and paleoecology to their interpretation. He has also elucidated early records of skeletonized animals in Namibia and remarkable fossils of the Ediacaran Doushantuo Formation, China, preserved in exceptional cellular detail by early diagenetic phosphate precipitation. Knoll and colleagues authored the first paper to demonstrate strong stratigraphic variation in the carbon isotopic composition of carbonates and organic matter preserved in Neoproterozoic (1000-539 million years ago) sedimentary rocks, and Knoll's group also demonstrated that mid-Proterozoic carbonates display little isotopic variation through time, in contrast to both older and younger successions.\n\n\nKnoll has longstanding interests in biomineralization, paleobotany, plankton evolution, and mass extinction.[1][2] Among other things, Knoll and his colleagues were the first to hypothesize that rapid build-up of carbon dioxide played a key role in end-Permian mass extinction, 252 million years ago. More generally, Knoll uses physiology as a conceptual bridge to integrate geochemical records of environmental change with paleontological records of biological history. He has also served as a member of the science team for NASA's MER rover mission to Mars.[4]\n\n\nHonors include membership in the US National Academy of Sciences,[5] the American Academy of Arts and Sciences,[6] the American Philosophical Society,[7] the American Academy of Microbiology, and Foreign Membership in the Royal Society of London and the National Academy of Sciences, India, as well as the Paleontological Society Medal, the Wollaston Medal of the Geological Society (London), the Moore Medal of the Society for Sedimentary Geology, the Oparin Medal of the International Society for the Study of the Origin of Life, the Sven Berggren Prize of the Royal Physiographic Society, Sweden, and both the Walcott and Thompson medals of the US National Academy of Sciences. He received the Phi Beta Kappa Book Award for \"Life on a Young Planet: The First Three Billion Years of Evolution on Earth\". In 2018, Knoll received the International Prize for Biology, conferred in Tokyo in the presence of the Emperor and Empress of Japan. In 2022, he received the Crafoord Prize in Geosciences.\n\n\n\n## Books[edit]\n\n\n* 2004 - *Life on a Young Planet: The First Three Billion Years of Evolution on Earth*.
