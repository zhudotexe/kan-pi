Founded in 1817, the university is the oldest and largest in Michigan; it was established twenty years before the territory became a state. It is also a founding member of the Association of American Universities.\n\n\nSince 1871, Michigan has been a coeducational institution. In 2021, it enrolled approximately 32,000 undergraduate students and 18,000 graduate students.[8] The university consists of 19 colleges and offers degree programs at undergraduate and graduate levels in some 250 disciplines. Michigan also has two regional universities, one in Flint and one in Dearborn, as well as a center in Detroit. Undergraduate admission to the university is categorized as \"most selective\"[9] and the university is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities \u2013 Very high research activity\".\n\n\nThe university's alumni include 8 domestic and foreign heads of state or heads of government; 47 U.S. senators; 218 members of the U.S. House of Representatives; 42 U.S. Cabinet secretaries; 41 U.S. governors; and 26 living billionaires.[10] As of 2022, Wolverine athletes have won 188 medals at the Olympic Games.[11]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the University of Michigan\n\n### 1817\u20131837[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Michigan was established on August 26, 1817,[1] as *Catholepistemiad*, or *Catholepistemiad Michigania***,** under an act of the Michigan Territory. The corporate existence of the university had its rise in the Act of 1817, and has been continuous throughout all subsequent changes of its organic law.[12]:\u200a11*Catholepistemiad,* a neologism, translates roughly as \"School of Universal Knowledge.\"[13]\n\n\n*Catholepistemiad* was not a university in the contemporary sense but rather a centralized system of schools, libraries, and other cultural institutions borrowing its model from the Imperial University of France founded by Napoleon I a decade earlier.[14][12]:\u200a10 Besides carrying on the central institution, the President and Didactorium of *Catholepistemiad* were also authorized to establish private colleges, academies, libraries, etc., throughout the Michigan Territory.[12]:\u200a10 It was only after the state of Michigan entered the Union in 1837 that a new plan was adopted to focus the corporation on higher education.[14] The charter of *Catholepistemiad* is an extraordinary example of the marked French influence upon American institutions which found its inception during the course of the Revolutionary War, and continued until it began to give way to German influence in the third or fourth decade of the 19th century.[12]:\u200a10\n\n\nShortly after the passage of the Act of 1817, Rev. John Monteith became the first president of *Catholepistemiad*, and Father Gabriel Richard, a Catholic priest, was vice president. Monteith and Richard enacted that private schools should be established in Detroit, Monroe and Mackinaw, and before the end of September, 1817, the three private schools were in operation.[12]:\u200a11 The cornerstone of the first school house, near the corner of Bates Street and Congress Street in Detroit, was laid on September 24, 1817. Subscriptions amounting to $5,000 payable in instalments running over several years were obtained to carry on the work.[12]:\u200a12 Of the total amount subscribed to start the work two-thirds came from Zion Masonic Lodge and its members.[15] In August 1818, a private Lancasterian school taught by Lemuel Shattuck was opened in the building.[12]:\u200a12\n\n\nOn April 30, 1821, the Michigan Territory passed a new act changing materially the appearance and nature of the existing educational organization.[12]:\u200a13 A board of trustees was appointed to oversee the corporation; the positions of president and vice president were eliminated, and Monteith and Richard were appointed to the board.[1] *University of Michigan* took the place of *Catholepistemiad Michigania* as the legal name of the corporation.\n\n\n\n![Painting of a rolling green landscape with trees with a row of white buildings in the background](image)*University of Michigan* (1855) Jasper Francis Cropsey\n### 1837\u20131900[edit]\n\n\nAfter the state of Michigan entered the Union in 1837, its constitution granted the university an unusual degree of autonomy as a \u201ccoordinate branch of state government.\u201d It delegated full powers over all university matters granted to its governing Board of Regents.[14] On June 3\u20135, the Board of Regents held its first meeting in Ann Arbor and formally accepted the proposal by the town to locate the university there.[1] The town of Ann Arbor had existed for only 13 years and had a population of about 2,000.[16] A grant of 40 acres (16\u00a0ha), obtained through the Treaty of Fort Meigs,[17] formed the basis of the present Central Campus.[18]\n\n\nSince the founding period, the private sector has remained the primary provider of university financing to supplement tuition collected from students. Early benefactors of the university included businessman Dexter M. Ferry (donor of Ferry Field), Arthur Hill (regent, donor of Hill Auditorium), the Nichols family (regents, donors of the Nichols Arboretum), William E. Upjohn (donor of the Peony\nGarden), William P. Trowbridge, John S. Newberry, who funded the construction of Helen H. Newberry Residence, and Henry N. Walker, a politician who led a group of prominent Detroit businessmen to fund the Detroit Observatory. Clara Harrison Stranahan, a close friend of Scottish-American industrialist Andrew Carnegie, donated $25,000 to the university in 1895 as a memorial of her father, Seth Harrison. The Waterman Gymnasium was financed by donations from wealthy citizens and matched Joshua W. Waterman's pledge of $20,000. When opened, the total cost of the building was $61,876.49, to which private donors contributed $49,524.34.[12]:\u200a67\n\n\n\n![](image)Alexander J. Davis's original University of Michigan designs featured the Gothic Revival style. Davis himself is generally credited with coining the term \"Collegiate Gothic.\"\nIn 1838, the Regents contracted with Alexander Jackson Davis, who according to Superintendent John Davis Pierce provided truly \"magnificent designs\" in the Gothic Revival style; but unfortunately the completion of them at that day would, as Pierce said, involve an expenditure of half a million dollars.[12]:\u200a31 Although approving the designs, the tight budget of the fledgling university forced the Regents to ultimately abandon them and instead adopted a much less expensive plan.[19] The superintendent of construction on the first structure to be built for the university was Isaac Thompson, an associate of Davis.[20] Asa Gray was the first professor appointed to Michigan on July 17, 1837.[21] His position was also the first one devoted solely to botany at any educational institution in America.[22][23][24] The first classes in Ann Arbor were held in 1841, with six freshmen and a sophomore, taught by two professors. Eleven students graduated in the first commencement in 1845.[25]\n\n\n\n![](image)Andrew Dickson White, founder and first president of Cornell University and among the earliest benefactors of Michigan, joined the Michigan faculty in 1858. He made his lasting mark on the grounds of the university by enrolling students to plant elms along the walkways on The Diag, resembling the \"glorious elms\" of Yale.[26]\nThe years 1837\u20131850 disclosed serious weakness in the organization and working of the university. Regents of the university discovered that the organic act from which they derived their powers, made them too dependent upon the legislature. The subject was brought to the attention of the legislature more than once but without securing the desired action in order to achieve increased independence. By the late 1840s, the Regents achieved a strong position relative to collective bargaining with the legislature as the opinion was becoming common among capitalists, clergymen and intellectual elites, since by then the state derived significant tax revenue through them. Such a situation ultimately led to a change in the organic act of the university. Remodeled, the act, which was approved April 8, 1851, emancipated the university from legislative control that would have been injudicious and harmful. The office of Regent was changed from an appointed one to an elected one, and the office of President was created, with the Regents directed to select one. As Hinsdale argued, \"the independent position of the university has had much to do with its growth and prosperity. In fact, its larger growth may be dated from the time when the new sections began to take effect.\"[12]:\u200a40\n\n\nMichigan was the first university in the West to pursue professional education, establishing its medical school in 1850, engineering courses in 1854, and a law school in 1859.[14] The university was among the first to introduce instruction in fields as diverse as zoology and botany, modern languages, modern history, American literature, pharmacy, dentistry, speech, journalism, teacher education, forestry, bacteriology, naval architecture, aeronautical engineering, computer engineering, and nuclear engineering.[14] In 1856, Michigan built the nation's first chemical laboratory.[27] That laboratory was the first structure on the North American continent that was designed and equipped solely for instruction in chemistry.[27] In 1869 Michigan opened the first university hospital in the country. James Burrill Angell, who served as the university's president from 1871 to 1909, expanded the curriculum to include professional studies in dentistry, architecture, engineering, government, and medicine.\n\n\nThe University of Michigan conferred the degree of Bachelor of Science in 1855, four years after the Lawrence Scientific School at Cambridge conferred the degree in 1851, for the first time in the United States, making Michigan the second institution in the country to confer the degree.[12]:\u200a48 The degree of Bachelor of Philosophy was conferred for the first time in the university's history upon six students in 1870.[12]:\u200a79 The degrees of Master of Philosophy and Doctor of Philosophy was first offered in 1875.[12]:\u200a88\n\n\nMethods of instruction had also undergone important changes. The *seminar* method of study was first introduced into the university by Charles Kendall Adams in 1871\u20131872, making the university the first American institution to naturalize this product of the German soil.[28][12]:\u200a71\n\n\nBy 1866, enrollment had increased to 1,205 students. Women were first admitted in 1870,[29] although Alice Robinson Boise Wood had become the first woman to attend classes (without matriculating) in 1866\u20137.[30] Among the early students in the School of Medicine was Jose Celso Barbosa, who in 1880 graduated as valedictorian and the first Puerto Rican to get a university degree in the United States. He returned to Puerto Rico to practice medicine and also served in high-ranking posts in the government.[31] Michigan was involved with the building of the Philippine education, legal, and public health systems during the era of the American colonization of the Philippines through the efforts of Michigan alumni that included Dean Conant Worcester and George A. Malcolm.[32]\n\n\nThroughout its history, Michigan has been one of the nation's largest universities, vying with the largest private universities such as Harvard University and Columbia University (then known as Columbia College) during the 19th and early 20th centuries, and then holding this position of national leadership until the emergence of the statewide public university systems in the post-WWII years.[14] By the turn of the 19th century, the university was the second largest in the United States after Harvard University.[33]\n\n\nDescendants of Massachusetts founding families made up a large portion of the university population in the 19th century; among them was Regent Charles Hebard, a lineal descendant of William Bradford, a founding father of Plymouth Colony.[12]:\u200a204\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe Diag, ca. 1900\n\nFrom 1900 to 1920, the growth of higher education led the university to build numerous new facilities. The Martha Cook Building was constructed as an all-female residence in 1915 as the result of a gift from William Wilson Cook in honor of his mother, Martha Walford Cook.[34]\nCook planned to endow a professorship of law of corporations, but eventually made possible the development of the Law Quadrangle.[35] The five buildings comprising the Law Quadrangle were constructed during the decade of 1923\u201333 on two city blocks purchased by the university: Lawyers Club, Dormitory Wing, John P. Cook Dormitory, William W Cook Legal Research Library, and Hutchins Hall.[35] The buildings, in the Tudor Gothic style, recalled the quadrangles of the two English ancient universities Oxford and Cambridge.[35]\n\n\n\n![](image)Physicists George Uhlenbeck, Hendrik Kramers, and Samuel Goudsmit circa 1928 at Michigan.\n![](image)\n![](image)\nWest Engineering Building, 1905\n\nFrom 1915 to 1941, the physics department was led by Harrison M. Randall, who established the importance of theoretical colleagues. Oskar Klein, Samuel Goudsmit, George Uhlenbeck, Otto Laporte and David Dennison joined the physics faculty during this time. Theoretical physicist Wolfgang Pauli, who became known as one of the pioneers of quantum physics, held a visiting professorship at the university in 1931.[36] Other physicists with ties to the university include the inventor of the Race Track Synchrotron H. Richard Crane and Hendrik Kramers. The Michigan Summer Symposia in Theoretical Physics occurred from 1927 to 1941 and provided lectures from theorists, including Niels Bohr, Paul Dirac, Enrico Fermi, Werner Heisenberg, and others.[36] J. Robert Oppenheimer lectured on the \"General Quantum Theory of Transitions\" at the university in 1931.[36]\n\n\nIn August 1946, Rensis Likert and his team formed the Survey Research Center at the University of Michigan. This became the Institute for Social Research (ISR) in 1949 when Dorwin Cartwright moved the Group Dynamics Research Center, the first institute devoted explicitly to group dynamics, from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to the University of Michigan.\n\n\nThe University of Michigan has been the birthplace of some important academic movements, establishing the Michigan schools of thought and developing the Michigan Models in various fields. John Dewey, Charles Horton Cooley, George Herbert Mead, and Robert Ezra Park first met at Michigan. There, they would influence each other greatly.[37] In political science, Angus Campbell, Philip Converse, Warren Miller and Donald Stokes, proposed the Michigan model of voting.[38] In business administration, Michigan Business School developed the Michigan model of human resource management in 1984. \n\n\nShortly after the war, in 1947, the Regents appointed a War Memorial Committee to consider establishing a war memorial in honor of students and alumni who fell in World War II, and in 1948, approved a resolution to \"create a war memorial center to explore the ways and means by which the potentialities of atomic energy may become a beneficent influence in the life of man, to be known as the Phoenix Project of the University of Michigan\", leading to the world's first academic program in nuclear science and engineering.[39][14] The Memorial Phoenix Project was funded by over 25,000 private contributors by individuals and corporations, such as the Ford Motor Company.[40]\n\n\nDuring the 1960s, the university campus was the site of numerous protests against the Vietnam War and university administration. On March 24, 1965, a group of U-M faculty members and 3,000 students held the nation's first-ever faculty-led \"teach-in\" to protest against American policy in Southeast Asia.[41][42][43] In response to a series of sit-ins in 1966 by *Voice*, the campus political party of Students for a Democratic Society, U-M's administration banned sit-ins. In response, 1,500 students participated in a one-hour sit-in inside the Administration Building, now known as the LSA Building. In April 1968, following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., a group of several dozen black students occupied the Administration Building to demand that the university make public its three-year-old commitment as a federal contractor to affirmative action and to increase its efforts with respect to recruiting more African American students, faculty and staff. At that time there were no African American coaches, for instance, in the Intercollegiate Athletics Department. The university's Spectrum Center is the oldest collegiate LGBT student center in the U.S., pre-dating Penn's.[44]\n\n\nDue to concerns over the university's financial situation there have been suggestions for the complete separation of the university and state through privatization.[45][46] Even though the university is a public institution *de jure*, it has embraced funding models of a private university that emphasize tuition funding and raising funds from private donors.[47] Considering that \"the University of Michigan already has only minimal fiscal ties to the state,\" the legislature convened a panel in 2008 that recommended converting the University of Michigan from a public to a private institution.[48]\n\n\n\n### Historical links[edit]\n\n\n![](image)John Dewey, founder of the University of Chicago Laboratory School\nThe University of Michigan was the first attempt in the New World to build a modern university in the European sense. The institution was the clearest and strongest presentation that had yet been made of what, in this country, at once came to be called the \"Prussian ideas.\" It was a radically different approach to higher education; a complete civil system of education, in contradistinction to the ecclesiastical system made out of the colonial colleges. Michigan alumni and faculty members carried this newer concept of the university with them as they founded other institutions including Andrew Dixon White, a cofounder of Cornell University.[14] Cornell alumni David Starr Jordan and John Casper Branner passed the concept to Stanford University in the late 19th century.\n\n\nMichigan also has many historical links to other American universities through its graduates.\n\n\n\n* University of California: had its early planning based upon the University of Michigan.[49][50]\n* University of Chicago: Michigan alumnus Robert Ezra Park played a leading role in the development of the Chicago School of sociology. The University of Chicago Laboratory School was founded in 1896 by John Dewey and Calvin Brainerd Cady, who were members of the Michigan faculty.\n* Cornell University: had its Law School founded by Michigan alumni Charles Kendall Adams and Harry Burns Hutchins.\n* Harvard University: Michigan alumnus Edwin Francis Gay was the founding dean of the Harvard Business School from 1908 to 1919,[51] instrumental in the school's planning.\n* Johns Hopkins University: had its pharmacology department established by John Jacob Abel, an alumnus of Michigan.\n* Massachusetts Institute of Technology: had its Media Lab, the world's leading research laboratory, founded by Michigan alumnus Jerome Wiesner.\n* Northwestern University: Michigan alumnus Henry Wade Rogers was instrumental in transforming Northwestern from a small cluster of colleges into a major, nationally recognized university. His wife, Emma Winner Rogers, founded the Northwestern University Settlement Association.[52]\n* Tufts University: had its College of Civic Life founded by John Angelo DiBiaggio, an alumnus of Michigan.[53]\n* Wellesley College: Michigan alumna Alice Freeman Palmer, the President of Wellesley College from 1881 to 1887, \"transformed the fledgling school from one devoted to Christian domesticity into one of the nation's premier colleges for women.\"[54]\n* Yale University: had its residential college system co-organized by James Rowland Angell, a graduate of Michigan.[55] Michigan alumnus Henry Wade Rogers introduced the \"case system\" and the college degree requirement into the Yale Law School.\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\nThe Ann Arbor campus is divided into four main areas: the North, Central, Medical, and South campuses. The physical infrastructure includes more than 500 major buildings,[56] with a combined area of more than 37.48\u00a0million square feet (860 acres; 3.482\u00a0km2).[57] The Central and South Campus areas are contiguous, while the North Campus area is separated from them, primarily by the Huron River.[58] There is also leased space in buildings scattered throughout the city, many occupied by organizations affiliated with the University of Michigan Health System. An East Medical Campus was developed on Plymouth Road, with several university-owned buildings for outpatient care, diagnostics, and outpatient surgery.[59]\n\n\nIn addition to the U-M Golf Course on South Campus, the university operates a second golf course on Geddes Road called Radrick Farms Golf Course. The golf course is only open to faculty, staff and alumni.[60] Another off-campus facility is the Inglis House, which the university has owned since the 1950s. The Inglis House is a 10,000-square-foot (930\u00a0m2) mansion used to hold various social events, including meetings of the Board of Regents, and to host visiting dignitaries.[61] The university also operates a large office building called Wolverine Tower in southern Ann Arbor near Briarwood Mall. Another major facility is the Matthaei Botanical Gardens, which is located on the eastern outskirts of Ann Arbor.[62]\n\n\nAll four campus areas are connected by bus services, the majority of which connect the North and Central campuses. There is a shuttle service connecting the University Hospital, which lies between North and Central campuses, with other medical facilities throughout northeastern Ann Arbor.[63]\n\n\nThe 2021 state budget boosted University of Michigan funding by 5% across all 3 campuses.[64]\n\n\nThe university has also seen increases in their sustainability efforts through climate, energy, food systems, water, and construction.[65]\n\n\n\n### Central Campus[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: University of Michigan Central Campus Historic District\n\nCentral Campus was the original location of U-M when it moved to Ann Arbor in 1837. It originally had a school and dormitory building (where Mason Hall now stands) and several houses for professors on 40 acres (16\u00a0ha) of land bounded by North University Avenue, South University Avenue, East University Avenue, and State Street. The President's House, located on South University Avenue, is the oldest building on campus as well as the only surviving building from the original 40-acre (16\u00a0ha) campus.[18] Because Ann Arbor and Central Campus developed simultaneously, there is no distinct boundary between the city and university, and some areas contain a mixture of private and university buildings.[66] Residence halls located on Central Campus are split up into two groups: the Hill Neighborhood and Central Campus.[67]\n\n\nCentral Campus is the location of the College of Literature, Science and the Arts, and is immediately adjacent to the medical campus. Most of the graduate and professional schools, including the Ross School of Business, the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy, the Law School and the School of Dentistry, are on Central Campus. Two prominent libraries, the Harlan Hatcher Graduate Library and the Shapiro Undergraduate Library (which are connected by a skywalk), are also on Central Campus.[68] as well as museums housing collections in archaeology, anthropology, paleontology, zoology, dentistry and art. Ten of the buildings on Central Campus were designed by Detroit-based architect Albert Kahn between 1904 and 1936 including Burton Memorial Tower and Hill Auditorium.[69]\n\n\n\n### North Campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Earl V. Moore Building on North Campus\nNorth Campus is the most contiguous campus, built independently from the city on a large plot of farmland\u2014approximately 800 acres (3.2\u00a0km2)\u2014that the university bought in 1952.[70] It is newer than Central Campus, and thus has more modernist architecture, whereas most Central Campus buildings are classical or Collegiate Gothic in style. The architect Eero Saarinen, based in Birmingham, Michigan, created one of the early master plans for North Campus and designed several of its buildings in the 1950s, including the Earl V. Moore School of Music Building.[71] North and Central Campuses each have unique bell towers that reflect the predominant architectural styles of their surroundings. Each of the bell towers houses a grand carillon, 2 of only 57 globally. The North Campus tower is called Lurie Tower.[72] The University of Michigan's largest residence hall, Bursley Hall, is located on North Campus.[67]\n\n\nNorth Campus houses the College of Engineering, the School of Music, Theatre & Dance, the Stamps School of Art & Design, the Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning, and an annex of the School of Information.[73] The campus is served by the Duderstadt Center, which houses the Art, Architecture and Engineering Library. The Duderstadt Center also contains multiple computer labs, video editing studios, electronic music studios, an audio studio, a video studio, multimedia workspaces, and a 3D virtual reality room.[74] Other libraries located on North Campus include the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library and the Bentley Historical Library.\n\n\n\n### South Campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)University of Michigan Golf Course was designed by Scottish golf course architect Alister MacKenzie and opened in 1931.\nSouth Campus is the site for the athletic programs, including major sports facilities such as Michigan Stadium, Crisler Center, and Yost Ice Arena. South Campus is also the site of the Buhr library storage facility, Revelli Hall, home of the Michigan Marching Band, the Institute for Continuing Legal Education,[75] and the Student Theatre Arts Complex, which provides shop and rehearsal space for student theatre groups.[76] The university's departments of public safety and transportation services offices are located on South Campus.[75]\n\n\nU-M's golf course is located south of Michigan Stadium and Crisler Center. It was designed in the late 1920s by Alister MacKenzie, the designer of Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia, home of the Masters Tournament.[77] The course opened to the public in the spring of 1931. The University of Michigan Golf Course was included in a listing of top holes designed by what *Sports Illustrated* calls \"golf's greatest course architect\". The U-M Golf Course's signature No. 6 hole\u2014a 310-yard (280\u00a0m) par 4, which plays from an elevated tee to a two-tiered, kidney-shaped green protected by four bunkers\u2014is the second hole on the Alister MacKenzie Dream 18 as selected by a five-person panel that includes three-time Masters champion Nick Faldo and golf course architect Tom Doak. The listing of \"the best holes ever designed by Augusta National architect Alister MacKenzie\" is featured in SI's Golf Plus special edition previewing the Masters on April 4, 2006.[78]\n\n\n\n## Organization and administration[edit]\n\n\nSee also: President of the University of Michigan and Board of Regents of the University of Michigan\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **College/school** | **Year founded**[79] |\n| Literature, Science, and the Arts | 1841\n |\n| Medicine | 1850\n |\n| Engineering | 1854\n |\n| Law | 1859\n |\n| Dentistry | 1875\n |\n| Pharmacy | 1876\n |\n| Music, Theatre & Dance | 1880\n |\n| Nursing | 1893\n |\n| Architecture & Urban Planning | 1906\n |\n| Graduate Studies | 1912\n |\n| Government | 1914\n |\n| Education | 1921\n |\n| Business | 1924\n |\n| Environment and Sustainability | 1927\n |\n| Public Health | 1941\n |\n| Social Work | 1951\n |\n| Information | 1969\n |\n| Art & Design | 1974\n |\n| Kinesiology | 1984\n |\n\n\nThe University of Michigan consists of a flagship campus in Ann Arbor, with two regional campuses in Dearborn and Flint. The Board of Regents, which governs the university and was established by the Organic Act of March 18, 1837, consists of eight members elected at large in biennial state elections[80] for overlapping eight-year terms.[81][82] Between the establishment of the University of Michigan in 1837 and 1850, the Board of Regents ran the university directly; although they were, by law, supposed to appoint a Chancellor to administer the university, they never did. Instead, a rotating roster of professors carried out the day-to-day administration duties.[83]\n\n\nThe President of the University of Michigan is the principal executive officer of the university. The office was created by the Michigan Constitution of 1850, which also specified that the president was to be appointed by the Regents of the University of Michigan and preside at their meetings, but without a vote.[84] Today, the president's office is at the Ann Arbor campus, and the president has the privilege of living in the President's House, the university's oldest building.[85] Mark Schlissel was president from July 2014 to January 2022, when he was fired by the board after an investigation determined he \"may have been involved in an inappropriate relationship with an employee of the university\".[86]\n\n\n\n![](image)Samuel Trask Dana Building (West Medical Building) houses the School for Environment and Sustainability\nThere are thirteen undergraduate schools and colleges.[87] By enrollment, the three largest undergraduate units are the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, the College of Engineering, and the Ross School of Business.[88] At the graduate level, the Rackham Graduate School serves as the central administrative unit of graduate education at the university.[89] There are 18 graduate schools and colleges. Professional degrees are conferred by the Schools of Architecture, Public Health, Dentistry, Law, Medicine, Urban Planning and Pharmacy.[88] The Medical School is partnered with the University of Michigan Health System, which comprises the university's three hospitals, dozens of outpatient clinics, and many centers for medical care, research, and education.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Student government[edit]\n\n\nHoused in the Michigan Union, the Central Student Government (CSG) is the central student government of the university. With representatives from each of the university's colleges and schools, including graduate students, CSG represents students and manages student funds on the campus. CSG is a 501(c)(3) organization, independent from the University of Michigan.[90] In recent years CSG has organized Airbus, a transportation service between campus and the Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport, and has led the university's efforts to register its student population to vote, with its Voice Your Vote Commission (VYV) registering 10,000 students in 2004. VYV also works to improve access to non-partisan voting-related information and increase student voter turnout.[91] CSG was successful at reviving Homecoming activities, including a carnival and parade, for students after a roughly eleven-year absence in October 2007,[92] and during the 2013\u201314 school year, was instrumental in persuading the university to rescind an unpopular change in student football seating policy at Michigan Stadium.[93] In 2017, CSG successfully petitioned the Ann Arbor City Council to create a Student Advisory Council to give student input into Ann Arbor city affairs.[94]\n\n\nThere are student governance bodies in each college and school, independent of Central Student Government. Undergraduate students in the LS&A are represented by the LS&A Student Government (LSA SG).[95] Engineering Student Government (ESG) manages undergraduate student government affairs for the College of Engineering. Graduate students enrolled in the Rackham Graduate School are represented by the Rackham Student Government (RSG), and law students are represented by the Law School Student Senate (LSSS) as is each other college with its own respective government. In addition, the students who live in the residence halls are represented by the University of Michigan Residence Halls Association (RHA), which contains the third most constituents after CSG and LSA SG.[96]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nWilliam W. Cook Legal Research Library and other buildings comprising the Law Quadrangle were built during 1923\u201333 and then donated to the university by William Wilson Cook. It was the university's most significant private gift at the time.\n\nA longstanding goal of the student government is to create a student-designated seat on the Board of Regents, the university's governing body.[97] Such a designation would achieve parity with other Big Ten schools that have student regents. In 2000, students Nick Waun and Scott Trudeau ran for the board on the statewide ballot as third-party nominees. Waun ran for a second time in 2002, along with Matt Petering and Susan Fawcett.[98] Although none of these campaigns has been successful, a poll conducted by the State of Michigan in 1998 concluded that a majority of Michigan voters would approve of such a position if the measure were put before them.[97] A change to the board's makeup would require amending the Michigan Constitution.[99]\n\n\n\n### Finances[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2019[update], U-M's financial endowment (the \"University Endowment Fund\") was valued at $12.4 billion.[100]\n\n\nIn the 1980s, the university received increased grants for research in the social and physical sciences. During the 1980s and 1990s, the university devoted substantial resources to renovating its massive hospital complex and improving the academic facilities on the North Campus. In the early 2000s, Michigan faced declining state funding due to state budget shortfalls. In fact, the university did not receive direct state appropriations until 1867, and for most of its history, state support has been limited.[14] The state's annual contribution to the school's operating budget was less than 6%. In 2011 less than 5% of its support comes from state appropriations, a number continued to drop.[14]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Academic rankings |\n| --- |\n| National |\n| *ARWU*[101] | 18 |\n| *Forbes*[102] | 23 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[103] | 21 |\n| *Washington Monthly*[104] | 23 |\n| *WSJ*/*College Pulse*[105] | 28 |\n| Global |\n| *ARWU*[106] | 26 |\n| *QS*[107] | 33 |\n| *THE*[108] | 23 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[109] | 19 |\n\n\nThe University of Michigan is a large, four-year, residential research university accredited by the Higher Learning Commission.[110][111][112] The four-year, full-time undergraduate program comprises the majority of enrollments and emphasizes instruction in the arts, sciences, and professions with a high level of coexistence between graduate and undergraduate programs. The university has \"very high\" research activity and the comprehensive graduate program offers doctoral degrees in the humanities, social sciences, and STEM fields as well as professional degrees in medicine, law, and dentistry.[110] U-M has been included on Richard Moll's list of Public Ivies.[113] With over 200 undergraduate majors, and 100 doctoral and 90 master's programs,[114] U-M conferred 6,490 undergraduate degrees, 4,951 graduate degrees, and 709 first professional degrees in 2011\u20132012.[115] Its most popular undergraduate majors, by 2021 graduates, were:[116]\n\n\n\nComputer and Information Sciences (874)\nBusiness Administration and Management (610)\nEconomics (542)\nBehavioral Neuroscience (319)\nMechanical Engineering (316)\nExperimental Psychology (312)\nThe 2021 *U.S.

With over 6,200 faculty members, 73 of whom are members of the National Academy and 471 of whom hold an endowed chair in their discipline,[133] the university manages one of the largest annual collegiate research budgets of any university in the United States. According to the National Science Foundation, Michigan spent $1.639 billion on research and development in 2021, ranking it 3rd in the nation.[134] This figure totaled over $1 billion in 2009.[135] The Medical School spent the most at over $445 million, while the College of Engineering was second at more than $160 million.[135] U-M also has a technology transfer office, which is the university conduit between laboratory research and corporate commercialization interests.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Thomas Henry Simpson Memorial Institute for Medical Research was constructed in 1924 as the result of a donation from the widow of iron magnate Thomas H. Simpson, in memory of her late husband, who had died of pernicious anemia\nIn 2009, U-M signed an agreement to purchase a facility formerly owned by Pfizer. The acquisition includes over 170 acres (0.69\u00a0km2) of property, and 30 major buildings comprising roughly 1,600,000 square feet (150,000\u00a0m2) of wet laboratory space, and 400,000 square feet (37,000\u00a0m2) of administrative space. At the time of the agreement, the university's intentions for the space were not fully articulated, but the expectation was that the new space would allow the university to ramp up its research and ultimately employ in excess of 2,000 people.[136]\n\n\nThe university is also a major contributor to the medical field with the EKG[137] and the gastroscope.[138] The university's 13,000-acre (53\u00a0km2) biological station in the Northern Lower Peninsula of Michigan is one of only 47 Biosphere Reserves in the United States.[139]\n\n\nIn the mid-1960s U-M researchers worked with IBM to develop a new virtual memory architectural model[140] that model became part of IBM's Model 360/67 mainframe computer (the 360/67 was initially dubbed the 360/65M where the \"M\" stood for Michigan).[141] The Michigan Terminal System (MTS), an early time-sharing computer operating system developed at U-M, was the first system outside of IBM to use the 360/67's virtual memory features.[142]\n\n\n\n\n\n*R&D statistics, by year*[143][144][145][146]\n|  | TotalResearchx $1000 | NationalRank | FederalResearchx $1000 | NationalRank | NationalAcademyMembers | NationalRank\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2017\n | 1,434,535\n | 2\n | 822,436\n | 3\n | 118\n | 9\n |\n| 2016\n | 1,357,228\n | 2\n | 780,080\n | 3\n | 113\n | 12\n |\n| 2015\n | 1,300,340\n | 2\n | 728,712\n | 3\n | 108\n | 13\n |\n| 2014\n | 1,279,603\n | 2\n | 733,779\n | 3\n | 106\n | 13\n |\n\n\nU-M is home to the National Election Studies and the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index. The Correlates of War project, also located at U-M, is an accumulation of scientific knowledge about war. The university is also home to major research centers in optics, reconfigurable manufacturing systems, wireless integrated microsystems, and social sciences. The University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute and the Life Sciences Institute are located at the university. The Institute for Social Research (ISR), the nation's longest-standing laboratory for interdisciplinary research in the social sciences,[147] is home to the Survey Research Center, Research Center for Group Dynamics, Center for Political Studies, Population Studies Center, and Inter-Consortium for Political and Social Research. Undergraduate students are able to participate in various research projects through the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP) as well as the UROP/Creative-Programs.[148]\n\n\nThe U-M library system comprises nineteen individual libraries with twenty-four separate collections\u2014roughly 13.3 million volumes as of 2012.[149] U-M was the original home of the JSTOR database, which contains about 750,000 digitized pages from the entire pre-1990 backfile of ten journals of history and economics, and has initiated a book digitization program in collaboration with Google.[150] The University of Michigan Press is also a part of the U-M library system.\n\n\nIn the late 1960s U-M, together with Michigan State University and Wayne State University, founded the Merit Network, one of the first university computer networks.[151] The Merit Network was then and remains today administratively hosted by U-M. Another major contribution took place in 1987 when a proposal submitted by the Merit Network together with its partners IBM, MCI, and the State of Michigan won a national competition to upgrade and expand the National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET) backbone from 56,000 to 1.5 million, and later to 45 million bits per second.[152] In 2006, U-M joined with Michigan State University and Wayne State University to create the University Research Corridor. This effort was undertaken to highlight the capabilities of the state's three leading research institutions and drive the transformation of Michigan's economy.[153] The three universities are electronically interconnected via the Michigan LambdaRail (MiLR, pronounced 'MY-lar'), a high-speed data network providing 10 Gbit/s connections between the three university campuses and other national and international network connection points in Chicago.[154]\n\n\nIn May 2021, the university announced plans to cut carbon emissions from its campuses. The plan covers all of its operations and goals include removing emissions from direct, on-campus sources by 2040.[155]\n\n\n\n## Student body[edit]\n\n\n### Undergraduate admissions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Undergraduate admissions statistics |\n| --- |\n| 2021 enteringclass[156]\n\n\n---\n\n |\n| Admit rate | 19.5%(16,235 out of 83,029) |\n| Yield rate | 46.4% |\n| Test scores middle 50% |\n| SAT EBRW | 680\u2013760 |\n| SAT Math | 710\u2013790 |\n| ACT Composite | 32\u201335 |\n| High school GPA |\n| Average | 3.90 |\n|  |\n\n\nThe requirements for admission to the freshman class were first published in August 1841, with fluency in ancient languages, such as Latin and Greek, being among the many requirements.[12]:\u200a33 Candidates for admission to the freshman class were examined in English grammar, geography, arithmetic, algebra, Virgil, Cicero's Select Orations, Jacob's or Felton's Greek Reader, Andrews and Stoddard's Latin Grammar, and Sophocles's Greek Grammar. In 1851, the university dropped the requirement for students who did not wish to pursue the usual collegiate course embracing the ancient languages, permitting their admission without examination in such languages.[12]:\u200a44 This provision may be considered a prelude to scientific education.\n\n\nRequirements for admission varied from department to department in the early days, and admissions were mostly given by referral. Candidates were required to do no more than satisfying professors on such inquiry as professors saw fit to make of their ability to do the work to obtain admission to the university. Such a practice was deemed flawed, eventually leading to corruption. In 1863, a rigid generalized entrance examination was imposed, creating one standard of qualifications for admission to all the departments, academical and professional.[12]:\u200a79 The early administration praised the then-new practice for its role in strengthening admission to the university.[12]:\u200a44 The entrance examination imposed in 1863 had played a significant role in the admission process during the 19th century until the emergence of the nationwide standardized tests, which were not offered until 1900.\n\n\nAdmission is based on academic prowess, extracurricular activities, and personal qualities. *U.S. News & World Report* rates Michigan \"Most Selective\"[9] and The Princeton Review rates its admissions selectivity of 96 out of 99.[157] Admissions are characterized as \"more selective, lower transfer-in\" according to the Carnegie Classification.[110][158] The university is need-blind for domestic applicants.[159]\n\n\nMichigan received over 83,000 applications for a place in the 2021\u201322 freshman class, making it one of the most applied-to universities in the United States.[158][160] In recent years, annual numbers of applications for freshman admission have exceeded 83,000. Around 16,000 students are offered admission annually, with a target freshman class of more than 7,000 students.[158] Students come from all 50 U.S. states and nearly 100 countries.[158] In academic year 2019\u201320 full-time undergraduate students made up about 97 percent of the undergraduate student body, with a first-time student retention rate of almost 97 percent.[156]\n\n\nIn 2003, two lawsuits involving U-M's affirmative action admissions policy reached the U.S. Supreme Court (*Grutter v. Bollinger* and *Gratz v. Bollinger*). President George W. Bush publicly opposed the policy before the court issued a ruling.[161] The court found that race may be considered as a factor in university admissions in all public universities and private universities that accept federal funding, but it ruled that a point system was unconstitutional. In the first case, the court upheld the Law School admissions policy, while in the second it ruled against the university's undergraduate admissions policy.[*citation needed*] The debate continued because in November 2006, Michigan voters passed Proposal 2, banning most affirmative action in university admissions. Under that law, race, gender, and national origin can no longer be considered in admissions.[162] U-M and other organizations were granted a stay from implementation of the law soon after that referendum. This allowed time for proponents of affirmative action to decide legal and constitutional options in response to the initiative results. In April 2014, the Supreme Court ruled in *Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action* that Proposal 2 did not violate the U.S. Constitution. The admissions office states that it will attempt to achieve a diverse student body by looking at other factors, such as whether the student attended a disadvantaged school, and the level of education of the student's parents.[162]\n\n\n\n### Enrollment[edit]\n\n\n\n\nStudent body composition as of May 2, 2022\n| Race and ethnicity[163] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| White | 55%\n | 55 |\n| Asian | 16%\n | 16 |\n| Other[a] | 10%\n | 10 |\n| Hispanic | 7%\n | 7 |\n| Foreign national | 7%\n | 7 |\n| Black | 5%\n | 5 |\n| Economic diversity |\n| Low-income[b] | 18%\n | 18 |\n| Affluent[c] | 82%\n | 82 |\n\n\nIn Fall 2016, the university had an enrollment of 44,718 students: 28,983 undergraduate students, 12,565 graduate students and 2,665 first professional students[8][88] in a total of 600 academic programs. Of all students, 37,954 (84.9%) are U.S. citizens or permanent residents and 6,764 (15.1%) are international students.[8]\n\n\nIn 2014, undergraduates were enrolled in 12 schools or colleges: About 61 percent in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts; 21 percent in the College of Engineering; 5.3 percent in the Ross School of Business; 3.3 percent in the School of Kinesiology; 2.7 percent in the School of Music, Theatre & Dance; and 2 percent in the School of Nursing. Small numbers of undergraduates were enrolled in the colleges or schools of Art & Design, Architecture & Urban Planning, Dentistry, Education, Pharmacy, and Public Policy.[88] In 2014, the School of Information opened to undergraduates, with the new Bachelor of Science in Information degree. Among undergraduates, 70 percent graduate with a bachelor's degree within four years, 86 percent graduate within five years and 88 percent graduating within six years.[164]\n\n\n\n![](image)West Hall at the Southeast corner of the Diag\nOf the university's 12,714 non-professional graduate students, 5,367 are seeking academic doctorates and 6,821 are seeking master's degrees. The largest number of master's degree students are enrolled in the Ross School of Business (1,812 students seeking MBA or Master of Accounting degrees) and the College of Engineering (1,456 students seeking M.S. or M.Eng. degrees). The largest number of doctoral students are enrolled in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (2,076) and College of Engineering (1,496). While the majority of U-M's graduate degree-granting schools and colleges have both undergraduate and graduate students, a few schools only issue graduate degrees. Presently, the School for Environment and Sustainability, School of Public Health, and School of Social Work only have graduate students.[88]\n\n\nIn Fall 2014, 3,411 Michigan students were enrolled in U-M's professional schools: the School of Dentistry (628 students), Law School (1,047 students), Medical School (1,300 students), and College of Pharmacy (436 students).[88]\n\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\n### Residential life[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University of Michigan Housing\n\n![Law Quadrangle](image)Law Quadrangle, constructed during the decade of 1923\u201333, was designed by York and Sawyer in the Tudor style and recalled the quadrangles of two ancient English universities, Oxford and Cambridge.\nThe University of Michigan's campus housing system can accommodate approximately 10,000 students, or nearly 25 percent of the total student population at the university.[165] The residence halls are located in three distinct geographic areas on campus: Central Campus, Hill Area (between Central Campus and the University of Michigan Medical Center) and North Campus. Family housing is located on North Campus and mainly serves graduate students. The largest residence hall has a capacity of 1,270 students,[166] while the smallest accommodates 25 residents.[167] A majority of upper-division and graduate students live in off-campus apartments, houses, and cooperatives, with the largest concentrations in the Central and South Campus areas.\n\n\n\n![](image)Statue of Portia, above the front entrance to the Martha Cook Residence Hall\n![](image)Lawyers Club Dining Hall\nThe residential system has a number of \"living-learning communities\" where academic activities and residential life are combined. These communities focus on areas such as research through the Michigan Research and Discovery Scholars, medical sciences, community service and the German language.[168] The Michigan Research and Discovery Scholars and the Women in Science and Engineering Residence Program are housed in Mosher-Jordan Hall. The Residential College (RC), a living-learning community that is a division of the College of Literature, Science and the Arts, also has its principal instructional space in East Quad. The Michigan Community Scholars Program, dedicated to civic engagement, community service learning and intercultural understanding and dialogue, is located in West Quad.[169] The Lloyd Hall Scholars Program (LHSP) is located in Alice Lloyd Hall. The Health Sciences Scholars Program (HSSP) is located in Couzens Hall. The North Quad complex houses two additional living-learning communities: the Global Scholars Program[170] and the Max Kade German Program.[171] It is \"technology-rich,\" and houses communication-related programs, including the School of Information, the Department of Communication Studies, and the Department of Screen Arts and Cultures.[172][173] North Quad is also home to services such as the Language Resource Center and the Sweetland Center for Writing.[174]\n\n\n\n![](image)Betsy Barbour Residence Hall, one of three all-female residence halls on campus, was designed by Albert Kahn in the English Georgian style.\nThe residential system also has a number of \"theme communities\" where students have the opportunity to be surrounded by students in a residential hall who share similar interests. These communities focus on global leadership, the college transition experience, and internationalism.[175] The Adelia Cheever Program is housed in the Helen Newberry House.[176] The First Year Experience is housed in the Baits II Houses and Markley Hall along with portions of all other buildings with the exception of North Quad, Northwood, and Stockwell Hall.[177] The Sophomore Experience is housed in Stockwell Hall and the Transfer Year Experience is housed in Northwood III.[178][179] The newly organized International Impact program is housed in North Quad.[180]\n\n\n\n![](image)Stockwell Residence Hall\n### Groups and activities[edit]\n\n\nThe university lists 1,438 student organizations, including Omega Omega Omega (OOO), the nation's first mental health fraternity.[181][182] The student body is politically engaged, though, with 96% stating they intended to vote in the 2020 election. It is largely progressive, with 43% identifying as very liberal, 33% as somewhat liberal, and 13% moderate. 11% identified as conservative or very conservative.[183] With a history of student activism, some of the most visible groups include those dedicated to causes such as civil rights and labor rights, such as local chapters of Students for a Democratic Society and United Students Against Sweatshops. Conservative groups also organize, such as the Young Americans for Freedom.[184]\n\n\n\n![](image)Michigan Union, an Art Deco building constructed on land wholly owned by the student society in 1917, was designed by Michigan alumni Irving Kane Pond and Allen Bartlit Pond.\nThere are also several engineering projects teams, including the University of Michigan Solar Car Team, which has placed first in the North American Solar Challenge six times and third in the World Solar Challenge four times.[185] Michigan Interactive Investments,[186] the TAMID Israel Investment Group, and the Michigan Economics Society[187] are also affiliated with the university.\n\n\nThe university also showcases many community service organizations and charitable projects, including Foundation for International Medical Relief of Children, Dance Marathon at the University of Michigan,[188] The Detroit Partnership, Relay For Life, U-M Stars for the Make-A-Wish Foundation, InnoWorks at the University of Michigan, SERVE, Letters to Success, PROVIDES, Circle K, Habitat for Humanity,[189] and Ann Arbor Reaching Out. Intramural sports are popular, and there are recreation facilities for each of the three campuses.[190]\n\n\nFraternities and sororities play a role in the university's social life; approximately seven percent of undergraduate men and 16% of undergraduate women are active in the Greek system.[191] Four different Greek councils\u2014the Interfraternity Council, Multicultural Greek Council, National Pan-Hellenic Council, and Panhellenic Association\u2014represent most Greek organizations. Each council has a different recruitment process.[192]\n\n\nThe Michigan Union and Michigan League are student activity centers located on Central Campus; Pierpont Commons is on North Campus. The Michigan Union houses a majority of student groups, including the student government. The William Monroe Trotter House, located east of Central Campus, is a multicultural student center operated by the university's Office of Multi-Ethnic Student Affairs.[193] The University Activities Center (UAC) is a student-run programming organization and is composed of 14 committees.[194] Each group involves students in the planning and execution of a variety of events both on and off campus.\n\n\n\n![](image)Delta Sigma Delta, the first dental fraternity in the world\nThe Michigan Marching Band, composed of more than 350 students from almost all of U-M's schools,[195] is the university's marching band. Over 125 years old (with a first performance in 1897),[196] the band performs at every home football game and travels to at least one away game a year. The student-run and led University of Michigan Pops Orchestra is another musical ensemble that attracts students from all academic backgrounds. It performs regularly in the Michigan Theater. The University of Michigan Men's Glee Club, founded in 1859 and the second oldest such group in the country, is a men's chorus with over 100 members.[197] Its eight-member subset a cappella group, the University of Michigan Friars, which was founded in 1955, is the oldest currently running *a cappella* group on campus.[198] The University of Michigan is also home to over twenty other a cappella groups, including Amazin' Blue, The Michigan G-Men, and Compulsive Lyres, all of which have competed at the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella (ICCA) finals in New York City. Compulsive Lyres are the first and only group from Michigan to claim an ICCA title, having won in 2002.[199] The Michigan G-Men are one of only six groups in the country to compete at ICCA finals four times, one of only two TTBB ensembles to do so, and placed third at the competition in 2015.[200] Amazin' Blue placed fourth at ICCA finals in 2017. In 2020, The A Cappella Archive ranked The Michigan G-Men and Amazin' Blue at #7 and #13, respectively, out of all groups that have ever competed in ICCA.[201]\n\n\n\n![](image)Phi Delta Phi, the oldest legal organization in continuous existence in the United States.\nNational honor societies such as Phi Beta Kappa, Phi Kappa Phi, and Tau Beta Pi have chapters at U-M.[202] Degrees \"with Highest Distinction\" are recommended to students who rank in the top 3% of their class, \"with High Distinction\" to the next 7%, and \"with Distinction\" to the next 15%. Students earning a minimum overall GPA of 3.4 who have demonstrated high academic achievement and capacity for independent work may be recommended for a degree \"with Highest Honors\", \"with High Honors\", or \"with Honors.\"[202] Those students who earn all A's for two or more consecutive terms in a calendar year are recognized as James B. Angell Scholars and are invited to attend the annual Honors Convocation, an event which recognizes undergraduate students with distinguished academic achievements.[202]\n\n\n\n![](image)The archway to the Law Quadrangle\nThe University of Michigan has over 380 cultural and ethnic student organizations on campus.[203] There are organizations for almost every culture from the Arab Student Association to Persian Student Association[204] to African Students Association[205] to even the Egyptian Student Association.[206] These organizations hope to promote various aspects of their culture along with raising political and social awareness around campus by hosting an assortment of events throughout the school year. These clubs also help students make this large University into a smaller community to help find people with similar interests and backgrounds.\n\n\n\n### Collegiate secret societies[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Michigan hosts three secret societies: Michigauma, Adara, and the Vulcans. Michigauma and Adara were once under the umbrella group \"The Tower Society\", the name referring to their historical locations in the Michigan Union tower. Michigauma was all-male while Adara was all-female, although both later became co-ed.\n\n\n\n* Michigauma, more recently known as the Order of Angell, was formed in 1902 by a group of seniors in coordination with University president James Burrill Angell. The group disbanded itself in 2021 due to public concerns about elitism and the society's history. The group was granted a lease for the top floor of the Michigan Union tower in 1932, which they referred to as the \"tomb,\" but the society vacated the space in 2000. Until more recent reforms, the group's rituals were inspired by the culture of Native Americans.[207] Some factions on campus identified Michigauma as a secret society, but many disputed that characterization, as its member list has been published some years in *The Michigan Daily* and the *Michiganensian*, and online since 2006 reforms.\n* Adara, known as Phoenix, was formed in the late 1970s by women leaders on campus and disbanded itself in 2021 amid campus criticisms of secret societies.[208] In the early 1980s they joined the tower society and occupied the sixth floor of the tower just below Michigamua.\n* Vulcans, occupied the fifth floor of the Union tower though were not formally a part of the tower society. They draw their heritage from the Roman god Vulcan. The group which used to do its tapping publicly is known for its long black robes and for its financial contributions of the College of Engineering.\n\n\n### Media and publications[edit]\n\n\nSeveral academic journals are published at the university:\n\n\n\n* The Law School publishes *Michigan Law Review* and six other law journals: The *Michigan Journal of Environmental and Administrative Law*, *University of Michigan Journal of Law Reform*, *Michigan Journal of Race & Law*, *Michigan Telecommunications and Technology Law Review*, *Michigan Journal of International Law*, and *Michigan Journal of Gender and Law*.[209]\n* The Ross School of Business publishes the *Michigan Journal of Business*.\n* Several undergraduate journals are also published at the university, including the *Michigan Journal of Political Science*, *Michigan Journal of History*, *University of Michigan Undergraduate Research Journal*, the *Michigan Journal of International Affairs*, and the *Michigan Journal of Asian Studies*.\n\n\nThe student newspaper is *The Michigan Daily*, founded in 1890 and editorially and financially independent of the university. *The Daily* is published five days a week during academic year, and weekly from May to August. The yearbook is the *Michiganensian*, founded in 1896. Other student publications at the university include the conservative *The Michigan Review* and the progressive *Michigan Independent*. The humor publication *Gargoyle Humor Magazine* is also published by Michigan students.\n\n\nWCBN-FM (88.3 FM) is the student-run college radio station which plays in freeform format. WOLV-TV is the student-run television station that is primarily shown on the university's cable television system. WJJX was previously the school's student-run radio station. A carrier current station, it was launched in 1953.[210]\n\n\n\n### Safety[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Michigan Division of Public Safety and Security (DPSS) is responsible for law enforcement and safety on the main campus. The Division of Public Safety leadership team is made up of one executive director, three division deputy directors, three police chiefs and four directors. In addition, the team is also joined by two program managers and an executive assistant.[211]\n\n\nThe University of Michigan Police Department (UMPD) is a full-service community-oriented law enforcement agency under the DPSS. Its police officers are licensed by the Michigan Commission on Law Enforcement Standards (MCOLES), and have full authority to investigate, search, arrest and use reasonable force, if necessary, to protect people and property under Michigan law and the U-M Regents' Ordinance.[212] The Special Victims Unit (SVU) of the U-M Police Department (UMPD) assists those who have experienced interpersonal violence, such as sexual assault, intimate partner violence, dating violence, stalking or child abuse.[213]\n\n\nViolent crime is rare on the campus though a few of the cases have been notorious including Theodore Kaczynski's attempted murder of professor James V. McConnell and research assistant Nicklaus Suino in 1985. Kaczynski, also known as the Unabomber, graduated from Michigan with his PhD in 1967.\n\n\nA radical left-wing militant organization Weather Underground was founded at the university in 1969.[214] It was later designated a domestic terrorist group by the FBI.[215]\n\n\nIn 2014, the University of Michigan was named one of 55 higher education institutions under investigation by the Office of Civil Rights \"for possible violations of federal law over the handling of sexual violence and harassment complaints.\" President Barack Obama's White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault was organized for such investigations.[216] Seven years later, in 2021, the university attracted national attention when a report commissioned by the university was released that detailed an investigation into sexual assault allegations against doctor Robert Anderson who reportedly abused at least 950 university students, many of whom were athletes, from 1966 to 2003.[217] Several football players from that time say legendary football coach Bo Schembechler ignored and enabled the abuse and told players to \"toughen up\" after being molested.[218] Schembechler reportedly punched his then 10-year-old son Matthew after he reported abuse by Anderson.[219] Following the exposure of a similar history of abuse at Ohio State University, male survivors of both Anderson at Michigan and Strauss at Ohio State spoke out to combat sexual abuse.[220] The University of Michigan settled with the survivors for $490 million.[221]\n\n\n\n## Athletics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Michigan Wolverines\n\n![](image)Burgee of University of Michigan\nThe University of Michigan's sports teams are called the Wolverines. They participate in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision and in the Big Ten Conference in all sports except women's water polo, which is a member of the Collegiate Water Polo Association. U-M boasts 27 varsity sports, including 13 men's teams and 14 women's teams.[222] In 10 of the past 14 years concluding in 2009, U-M has finished in the top five of the NACDA Director's Cup, a ranking compiled by the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics to tabulate the success of universities in competitive sports. U-M has finished in the top 10 of the Directors' Cup standings in 21 of the award's 29 seasons between 1993-2021 and has placed in the top six in nine of the last 10 seasons.[223]\n\n\nMore than 250 Michigan athletes or coaches have participated in Olympic events,[224] and as of 2021 its students and alumni have won 155 Olympic medals.[225]\n\n\nMichigan Stadium is the largest college football stadium in the nation and one of the largest football-only stadiums in the world, with an official capacity of 107,601[226] (the extra seat is said to be \"reserved\" for Fritz Crisler[227]) though attendance\u2014frequently over 111,000 spectators\u2014regularly exceeds the official capacity.[228] The NCAA's record-breaking attendance has become commonplace at Michigan Stadium.\n\n\nU-M is also home to 29 men's and women's club sports teams, such as rugby, hockey, volleyball, boxing, soccer, and tennis.\n\n\n\n### National championships[edit]\n\n\nThe Michigan football program ranks first in NCAA history in total wins (989 through the end of the 2022 season) and third among FBS schools in winning percentage (.731).[229][230] The team won the first Rose Bowl game in 1902. U-M had 40 consecutive winning seasons from 1968 to 2007, including consecutive bowl game appearances from 1975 to 2007.[231] The Wolverines have won a record 44 Big Ten championships. The program has 11 national championships, most recently in 1997,[232] and has produced three Heisman Trophy winners: Tom Harmon, Desmond Howard and Charles Woodson.[233]\n\n\nThe men's ice hockey team, which plays at Yost Ice Arena, has won nine national championships.[234]\n\n\nThe men's basketball team, which plays at the Crisler Center, has appeared in five Final Fours and won the national championship in 1989. The program also voluntarily vacated victories from its 1992\u20131993 and 1995\u20131999 seasons in which illicit payments to players took place, as well as its 1992 and 1993 Final Four appearances.[235] The men's basketball team has most recently won back-to-back Big Ten Tournament Championships.\n\n\n\n### In the Olympics[edit]\n\n\nThrough the 2012 Summer Olympics, 275 U-M students and coaches had participated in the Olympics, winning medals in each Summer Olympic Games except 1896, and winning gold medals in all but four Olympiads. U-M students/student-coaches (e.g., notably, Michael Phelps) have won a total of 185 Olympic medals: 85 golds, 48 silvers, and 52 bronzes.[236]\n\n\n\n### Fight songs and chants[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Michigan's fight song, \"The Victors\", was written by student Louis Elbel in 1898 following the last-minute football victory over the University of Chicago that won a league championship. The song was declared by John Philip Sousa to be \"the greatest college fight song ever written.\"[237] The song refers to the university as being \"the Champions of the West.\" At the time, U-M was part of the Western Conference, which would later become the Big Ten Conference. Michigan was considered to be on the Western Frontier when it was founded in the old Northwest Territory.\n\n\nAlthough mainly used at sporting events, the Michigan fight song is often heard at other events as well. President Gerald Ford had it played by the United States Marine Band as his entrance anthem during his term as president from 1974 to 1977, in preference over the more traditional \"Hail to the Chief\",[238] and the Michigan Marching Band performed a slow-tempo variation of the fight song at his funeral.[239] The fight song is also sung during graduation commencement ceremonies. The university's alma mater song is \"The Yellow and Blue.\" A common rally cry is \"Let's Go Blue!\" which has a complementary short musical arrangement written by former students Joseph Carl, a sousaphonist, and Albert Ahronheim, a drum major.[240]\n\n\nBefore \"The Victors\" was officially the university's fight song, the song \"There'll Be a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight\" was considered to be the school song.[241] After Michigan temporarily withdrew from the Western Conference in 1907, a new Michigan fight song \"Varsity\" was written in 1911 because the line \"champions of the West\" was no longer appropriate.[242]\n\n\n\n## Museums[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of museums and collections at the University of Michigan.\n\n![](image)Newberry Hall (Kelsey Museum of Archeology)\nThe university is also home to several public and research museums including but not limited to the University Museum of Art, University of Michigan Museum of Natural History, Detroit Observatory, Sindecuse Museum of Dentistry, and the LSA Museum of Anthropological Archaeology.\n\n\nKelsey Museum of Archeology has a collection of Roman, Greek, Egyptian, and Middle Eastern artifacts.[243] Between 1972 and 1974, the museum was involved in the excavation of the archaeological site of Dibsi Faraj in northern Syria.[244] The Kelsey Museum re-opened November 1, 2009 after a renovation and expansion.[245]\n\n\nThe collection of the University of Michigan Museum of Art include nearly 19,000 objects that span cultures, eras, and media and include European, American, Middle Eastern, Asian, and African art, as well as changing exhibits. The Museum of Art re-opened in 2009 after a three-year renovation and expansion.[246] UMMA presents special exhibitions and diverse educational programs featuring the visual, performing, film and literary arts that contextualize the gallery experience.[247]\n\n\nThe University of Michigan Museum of Natural History began in the mid-19th century and expanded greatly with the donation of 60,000 specimens by Joseph Beal Steere in the 1870s. The building also houses three research museums: the Museum of Anthropology, Museum of Paleontology. Today, the collections are primarily housed and displayed in the Ruthven Museums Building which was completed in 1928.[248]\n\n\n\n## Notable alumni[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of University of Michigan alumni.\n\nIn addition to U.S. President Gerald Ford, who played on the university's football team, the university is, as of 2020,[update] associated with thirty-four Pulitzer Prize winners, twenty-seven Rhodes Scholars,[249] one Mitchell Scholar,[250] and ten Nobel laureates. As of 2012[update], the university had almost 500,000 living alumni.[251]\n\n\nMore than 250 Michigan graduates have served as legislators as either a United States Senator (47 graduates) or as a Congressional representative (over 215 graduates), including former House Majority Leader Dick Gephardt[252] and U.S. Representative Justin Amash, who represented Michigan's Third Congressional District.[253] Mike Duggan, Mayor of Detroit, earned his bachelor's degree and J.D. degree at Michigan, while the former Michigan Governor Rick Snyder earned his bachelor, M.B.A., and J.D. degrees from Michigan. Former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson received his medical degree from the U-M medical school. Thomas E. Dewey, another Michigan alumnus, was the Governor of New York from 1943 to 1954 and was the Republican Party's presidential nominee in the 1944 and 1948 presidential elections. The 13th President of Pakistan, Arif Alvi, completed his master's degree in prosthodontics in 1975.\n\n\n\n* ![Clarence Darrow Lawyer (1878, Law)](image)\n\nClarence Darrow  \nLawyer  \n(1878, Law)\n* ![Frank Murphy Supreme Court Justice (1914, Law)](image)\n\nFrank Murphy  \nSupreme Court Justice  \n(1914, Law)\n* ![Arleigh Burke Admiral, namesake of destroyer class (1931, MS)](image)\n\nArleigh Burke  \nAdmiral, namesake of destroyer class  \n(1931, MS)\n* ![Gerald Ford President (1935, BA)](image)\n\nGerald Ford  \nPresident  \n(1935, BA)\n* ![Raoul Wallenberg Diplomat and humanitarian (1935, BA)](image)\n\nRaoul Wallenberg  \nDiplomat and humanitarian  \n(1935, BA)\n* ![Arthur Miller Playwright (1938, BA)](image)\n\nArthur Miller  \nPlaywright  \n(1938, BA)\n* ![Mike Wallace Journalist (1939, BA)](image)\n\nMike Wallace  \nJournalist  \n(1939, BA)\n* ![James Earl Jones Actor (1955, BA)](image)\n\nJames Earl Jones  \nActor  \n(1955, BA)\n* ![James Irwin Astronaut, co-founder of UM Club of the Moon (1957, MS)](image)\n\nJames Irwin  \nAstronaut, co-founder of UM Club of the Moon (1957, MS)\n* ![Jessye Norman Opera singer (1968, MA)](image)\n\nJessye Norman  \nOpera singer  \n(1968, MA)\n* ![Lawrence Kasdan Filmmaker (1971, M.Ed.)](image)\n\nLawrence Kasdan  \nFilmmaker  \n(1971, M.Ed.)\n* ![Eugene Robinson Columnist (1974, BA)](image)\n\nEugene Robinson  \nColumnist  \n(1974, BA)\n* ![Edmund White Author (1962, BA)](image)\n\nEdmund White  \nAuthor  \n(1962, BA)\n* Madonna Entertainer (No degree)\n\nMadonna  \nEntertainer  \n(No degree)\n* ![Larry Page Co-founder of Google (1995, BS)](image)\n\nLarry Page  \nCo-founder of Google  \n(1995, BS)\n* ![Tom Brady Football player (1999, BGS)](image)\n\nTom Brady  \nFootball player  \n(1999, BGS)\n* ![Michael Phelps Olympic swimmer (No degree)](image)\n\nMichael Phelps  \nOlympic swimmer  \n(No degree)\n\n\nU-M's contributions to aeronautics include aircraft designer Clarence \"Kelly\" Johnson of Lockheed Skunk Works fame,[254] Lockheed president Willis Hawkins, and several astronauts including the all-U-M crews of both Gemini 4[255] and Apollo 15.[256]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nRobert E. Park\n![](image)\nAlice Hamilton (MD, 1893)\n![](image)\nClaude Shannon (BA, BSEE)\n\nNumerous U-M graduates contributed to the field of computer science, including Claude Shannon (who made major contributions to the mathematics of information theory),[257] and Turing Award winners Edgar Codd, Stephen Cook, Frances E. Allen and Michael Stonebraker. U-M also counts among its alumni nearly two dozen billionaires, including prominent tech-company founders and co-founders such as J. Robert Beyster, who founded Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) in 1969[258] and Google co-founder Larry Page.[259]\n\n\n\n![](image)Alice Freeman Palmer (BA, 1876, PhD Hon, 1882)\nBy 1900, nearly 150 women had received advanced degrees from U-M.[260] Sarah Dix Hamlin was the first female student accepted to the University of Michigan. She graduated in 1874.[261] Marjorie Lee Browne received her M.S. in 1939 and her doctoral degree in 1950, becoming the third African American woman to earn a PhD in mathematics.[262][263] Many, however, were forced to leave the university to continue their studies or to become faculty in their own right elsewhere, like Katharine Coman\u2014when U-M President James Angell offered her a \"Dean of Women\" position, she told him that \"'if the regents...wish to propose a chaperone for students, and propose to dignify that office by allowing the woman who holds it to do a little University teaching,' she was not interested. If, however, the regents accepted women as equal partners and as faculty, and if she were one of several women given proper rank and authority, she would consider it.\"[260] Michigan's Regents did not accept, so instead Coman became dean, founder of the Economics Department, and the first female statistics professor in the US at Wellesley College.[264]:\u200a15\n\n\nNotable writers who attended U-M include playwright Arthur Miller,[252] essayists Susan Orlean,[252] Jia Tolentino,[265] Sven Birkerts, journalists and editors Mike Wallace,[252] Jonathan Chait of *The New Republic*, Indian author and columnist Anees Jung, Daniel Okrent,[252] and Sandra Steingraber, food critics Ruth Reichl and Gael Greene, novelists Brett Ellen Block, Elizabeth Kostova, Marge Piercy,[252] Brad Meltzer,[252] Betty Smith,[252] and Charles Major, screenwriter Judith Guest,[252] Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Theodore Roethke, National Book Award winners Keith Waldrop and Jesmyn Ward, composer/author/puppeteer Forman Brown, Alireza Jafarzadeh (a Middle East analyst, author, and TV commentator), and memoirist and self-help book author Jerry Newport.\n\n\nIn Hollywood, famous alumni include actors Michael Dunn,[252] Darren Criss, James Earl Jones,[252] David Alan Grier,[252] actresses Lucy Liu,[252] Gilda Radner,[252] and Selma Blair,[252] television director Mark Cendrowski, and filmmaker Lawrence Kasdan.[252] Many Broadway and musical theatre actors, including Gavin Creel,[252] Andrew Keenan-Bolger, his sister Celia Keenan-Bolger, and Taylor Louderman attended U-M for musical theatre. The musical theatre group StarKid Productions had their start at the university, and staged multiple productions there.[266]\n\n\nMusical graduates include operatic soprano Jessye Norman,[252] singer Joe Dassin, multiple members of the band Tally Hall, jazz guitarist Randy Napoleon, and Mannheim Steamroller founder Chip Davis.[252] Well-known composers who are alumni include Frank Ticheli, Andrew Lippa, and the Oscar and Tony Award-winning duo Benj Pasek and Justin Paul. Pop superstar Madonna[252] and rock legend Iggy Pop,[252] attended but did not graduate.\n\n\n\n![](image)14th President of Yale University James Rowland Angell, an early proponent of eugenics, graduated from Michigan in 1890. His father, James Burrill Angell, was President of the University of Michigan from 1871 to 1909.\nOther U-M graduates include former Dean of Harvard Law School Martha Minow, Dean of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania Erika H. James, current Dean of Yale Law School, Heather Gerken, assisted-suicide advocate Jack Kevorkian,[252] Weather Underground radical activist Bill Ayers,[267] activist Tom Hayden,[252] architect Charles Moore,[268] the Swedish Holocaust hero Raoul Wallenberg,[269] and Civil War General Benjamin D. Pritchard.[270] Neurosurgeon and CNN chief medical correspondent Sanjay Gupta attended both college and medical school at the university.[271] Clarence Darrow attended law school at U-M at a time when many lawyers did not receive any formal education.[252] Frank Murphy, who was mayor of Detroit, governor of Michigan, attorney general of the United States, and Supreme Court justice was also a graduate of the Law School.[252] Conservative pundit Ann Coulter is another U-M law school graduate (J.D. 1988).[252]\n\n\nVaughn R. Walker, a federal district judge in California who overturned the controversial California Proposition 8 in 2010 and ruled it unconstitutional, received his undergraduate degree from U-M in 1966.[272]\n\n\nKenneth Marin, who became a professor of economics after he graduated from the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, was appointed by President Lyndon B. Johnson as a member of the White House Consumer Advisory Council where he served on Wage and Price Control in the mid-1960s. He went to Tanzania in the late sixties and worked as an economic advisor to the government of President Julius Nyerere until the early 1970s.\n\n\nU-M athletes have starred in Major League Baseball, the National Football League and National Basketball Association as well as other professional sports. Notable among recent players is Tom Brady of the New England Patriots and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.[252] Three players have won college football's Heisman Trophy, awarded to the player considered the best in the nation: Tom Harmon (1940), Desmond Howard (1991) and Charles Woodson (1997).[233] Professional golfer John Schroeder and Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps also attended the University of Michigan, with the latter studying Sports Marketing and Management. Phelps also swam competitively for Club Wolverine, a swimming club associated with the university.[273] National Hockey League players Marty Turco, Luke Hughes, Chris Summers, Max Pacioretty, Carl Hagelin, Dylan Larkin, Zach Hyman, Brendan Morrison,[252] Jack Johnson, and Michael Cammalleri[252] all played for U-M's ice hockey team. Baseball Hall of Famers George Sisler and Barry Larkin also played baseball at the university.[252] Several team owners have also been alumni, including multiple-team owner Bill Davidson (NBA Detroit Pistons, NHL Tampa Bay Lightning, WNBA Detroit Shock, among others) and NFL owners Stephen M. Ross (Miami Dolphins), Preston Robert Tisch (New York Giants), and Ralph Wilson (Buffalo Bills).\n\n\nThe university claims the only alumni association with a chapter on the Moon, established in 1971 when the crew of Apollo 15 (two of whom had engineering degrees from U-M; the third had attended for a year before transferring[256]) placed a charter plaque for a new U-M Alumni Association on the lunar surface.[252] The plaque states: \"The Alumni Association of The University of Michigan. Charter Number 1. This is to certify that The University of Michigan Club of The Moon is a duly constituted unit of the Alumni Association and entitled to all the rights and privileges under the Association's Constitution.\" Several small U-M flags were also brought on the mission; a persistent campus legend claims at least one flag was left on the Moon.[256]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Other consists of Multiracial Americans & those who prefer to not say.\n2. **^** The percentage of students who received an income-based federal Pell grant intended for low-income students.\n3. **^** The percentage of students who are a part of the American middle class at the bare minimum.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"U-M's Foundings in Detroit and Ann Arbor: Key Dates\".

The series, which aired from September 19, 2005 to March 31, 2014, follows the main character, Ted Mosby, and his group of friends in New York City's Manhattan. As a framing device, Ted, in 2030, recounts to his son, Luke, and daughter, Penny, the events from September 2005 to May 2013 that led him to meet their mother. *How I Met Your Mother* was a joint production by Bays & Thomas Productions and 20th Century Fox Television, and syndicated by 20th Television (now Disney-ABC Domestic Television).\n\n\nThe series was loosely inspired by Thomas and Bays' friendship when they both lived in New York.[1] The vast majority of the episodes (196 out of 208) were directed by Pamela Fryman. The other directors were Rob Greenberg (7 episodes), Michael Shea (4 episodes), and Neil Patrick Harris (1 episode).\n\n\nKnown for its unique structure, humor, and incorporation of dramatic elements, *How I Met Your Mother* was popular throughout its run. It received positive reviews initially, but reception became more mixed as the seasons went on.[2][3][4] The show was nominated for 91 awards and received 21. In 2010, Alyson Hannigan won the People's Choice Award for Favorite TV Comedy Actress. In 2012, seven years after its premiere, the series won the People's Choice Award for Favorite Network TV Comedy, and Neil Patrick Harris won the award for Favorite TV Comedy Actor twice.\n\n\n\n\n## Premise[edit]\n\n\nThe series follows the adventures of Ted Mosby (played by Josh Radnor) and his love life as a single man. His stories are narrated by Bob Saget as Ted Mosby 25 years later as he tells them to his children.\n\n\nThe story goes into a flashback and starts in 2005 with Ted Mosby living in New York City and working as an architect. The narrative deals primarily with his best friends. These include the long-lasting couple Marshall Eriksen (Jason Segel), a law student and Lily Aldrin (Alyson Hannigan), a kindergarten teacher, who have been dating for almost nine years when Marshall proposes, as well as womanizing playboy Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris), and Canadian news reporter Robin Scherbatsky (Cobie Smulders). All of the characters' lives are entwined. The series explores many storylines, including a \"will they or won't they\" relationship between Robin and each of the two single male friends, Marshall and Lily's relationship, and the ups and downs of the characters' careers.\n\n\nThe show's frame story depicts Ted (voice of Bob Saget, uncredited) verbally retelling the story to his son Luke (David Henrie) and daughter Penny (Lyndsy Fonseca) as they sit on the couch in the year 2030. This future-set frame is officially the show's \"present day\", and *How I Met Your Mother* exploits this framing device in numerous ways: to depict and re-depict events from multiple points of view; to set up jokes using quick and sometimes multiple flashbacks nested within the oral retelling; to substitute visual, verbal, or aural euphemisms for activities Ted does not want to talk about with his children (sexual practices, use of illicit substances, vulgar language, etc.).\n\n\nWhile the traditional love story structure begins when the romantic leads first encounter each other, *How I Met Your Mother* does not introduce Ted's wife (Cristin Milioti) until the eighth-season finale and only announces her full name, Tracy McConnell, during the series finale. Her first name, Tracy, is mentioned in the first season, at the end of episode nine.\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n*How I Met Your Mother* was inspired by Carter Bays and Craig Thomas' idea to \"write about our friends and the stupid stuff we did in New York\", where they previously worked as writers for *Late Show with David Letterman*, among others.[1] The two drew from their friendship in creating the characters. Ted is based loosely on Bays, and Marshall and Lily are based loosely on Thomas and his wife.[5][6] Thomas' wife Rebecca was initially reluctant to have a character based on her but agreed if they could get Alyson Hannigan to play her. Hannigan was looking to do more comedy work and was available.[5] Josh Radnor and Jason Segel, who were cast as Ted and Marshall, respectively, were not well known, although Segel had been a cast member on the short-lived *Freaks and Geeks* and a recurring guest star on Judd Apatow's follow-up show, *Undeclared*. The role of Barney was initially envisioned as a \"John Belushi-type character\"[7] before Neil Patrick Harris won the role after being invited to an audition by the show's casting director Megan Branman.[8] Pamela Fryman invited Bob Saget to be the voiceover narrator, Future Ted, explaining to him that the show would be like *The Wonder Years* but \"kind of into the future\".[9] Saget either went to the television studio and recorded the narration while watching the episode, or did so separately and rerecorded with the episode if necessary.[10] He normally did not attend table readings but did so for the last episode.[11]\n\n\nIn multiple interviews Bays and Thomas have stated that \"a pretty famous actress\"[12] turned down the role of Robin, who they revealed in February 2014 was Jennifer Love Hewitt.[13] They then cast the unknown Cobie Smulders; Bays and Thomas later said, \"Thank God we did for a million reasons... when Ted's seeing her for the first time, America's seeing her for the first time\u2014the intrigue of that propelled the show going forward and kept the show alive\".[12] Although Ted is initially smitten by Robin in the pilot, it is quickly established at the end of the episode that she is not the mother, which Thomas said was done so they would not repeat the \"will they or won't they\" Ross and Rachel storyline from *Friends*.[6]\n\n\nAccording to an *Entertainment Weekly* article, the writers adopted facets of each main actor's personality and incorporated them into their characters. This includes Neil Patrick Harris' skills with magic, Jason Segel's passion for songwriting, Alyson Hannigan's absent-mindedness while pregnant, and Josh Radnor's intellectualism.[14]\n\n\nMacLaren's, an Irish bar in the middle of New York City, in which a lot of the show is set, is loosely based on four favorite bars of Bays, Thomas, and others' from the *Late Show* staff. Others include: McGee's, a Midtown tavern near the Ed Sullivan Theater where the *Late Show* is taped; McHale's, a legendary Hell's Kitchen bar which closed in 2006; Chumley's, a since-closed historic Greenwich Village pub; and Fez, another closed bar on the Upper West Side.[15] McGee's had a mural that Bays and Thomas both liked and wanted to incorporate into the show.[16] The name for the bar is from Carter Bays' assistant, Carl MacLaren; the bartender in the show is also named Carl.[17]\n\n\nEpisodes were generally shot over a three-day period in the Los Angeles-based Soundstage Studio 22[18] and featured upwards of 50 scenes with quick transitions and flashbacks. However, the \"Pilot\" episode was filmed at CBS Radford.[19] The laugh track was later created by recording an audience being shown the final edited episode. Thomas claimed that shooting before a live audience would have been impossible because of the structure of the show and the numerous flashforwards in each episode and because doing so \"would blur the line between 'audience' and 'hostage situation'\".[20] Later seasons started filming in front of an audience on occasion, when smaller sets were used.\n\n\nThe theme song is a portion of \"Hey Beautiful\" by The Solids, of which Bays and Thomas are members. Episodes from season 1 generally started with the opening credits. A cold opening has been used since season 2. Viewers then occasionally see Ted's children on a couch and hear him talking to them, telling the story of how he met their mother. Alternatively, scenes from previous episodes or shots of New York City with Ted narrating over the top are shown. Thomas has stated that Future Ted is an unreliable narrator, since he is trying to tell a story that happened over 20 years earlier;[21] this has been a plot point in several episodes including \"The Goat\", \"Oh Honey\", \"How I Met Everyone Else\", and \"The Mermaid Theory\". Nevertheless, Thomas has also emphasized maintaining a coherent and consistent universe and trying to avoid continuity errors, a problem he noticed in other shows.[22]\n\n\nA scene relating to the identity of the mother, involving Ted's future children, was filmed in 2006 for the show's eventual series finale.[23] This was done because the teenage actors portraying them would be adults by the time the final season was shot.[21]\n\n\nDuring the 2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike, *How I Met Your Mother* shut down production; when the strike ended, the show returned on March 17, 2008, with nine new episodes.[24] The network announced a change in the timeslot to 8:30 pm ET/7:30 pm CT, flip-flopping from the summer schedule with *The Big Bang Theory*.[25] CBS renewed the show for a fourth season on May 14, 2008,[26] which premiered on September 22, 2008.[27]\n\n\nIn September 2008, Lifetime Television announced it had purchased the cable rerun rights to *How I Met Your Mother* at a rate of about $725,000 per episode.[28] The four-year syndication contract stipulated that the studio deliver at least 110 half-hour episodes by 2010 and allowed for up to eight seasons of the show. At the end of the fourth season only 88 episodes had been produced, and a further 22 episodes were required, ensuring that there would be a fifth season.[29] There also was a complication with the writing of the show because of actress Alyson Hannigan's absence due to her pregnancy; in response, the writers had to create episodes that did not include one of the five main characters.[30] On May 19, 2009, the fifth-season renewal was announced.[31] May 20, 2009, CBS announced that *How I Met Your Mother* would again be aired at 8 pm, leading into the new comedy *Accidentally on Purpose*. On January 12, 2010, the show aired its 100th episode, and CBS announced that the series would return for a sixth season.[32]\nUpon learning that the series would be syndicated, Thomas said, \"We're thrilled that it will live on in other forms,\" and they were proud of the show and it was great to see the strong demand.[33]\n\n\nReruns of the series began airing on local U.S. broadcast television stations and on Chicago-based cable superstation WGN America on September 14, 2010. Featured in these airings are vanity cards previously unseen in the CBS and Lifetime airings due to marginalized credit sequences used by the two networks. Shown in between the closing credits and the production company credits, these vanity cards show portions of \"The Bro Code\", a list of rules frequently referenced by Harris' character, Barney Stinson, on how men should interact with each other, with an emphasis on activities involving pursuing members of the opposite sex. The opening theme song for the syndicated reruns is also slightly edited, running shorter and not using all the pictures seen in the opening montage that runs on DVD and the original CBS broadcasts. The episodes are also slightly shorter, to allow for more commercials during a timeslot in syndication.\n\n\nOne of the series' traditions involved giving guest roles to actors from various Joss Whedon productions, many of whom co-starred with Hannigan on *Buffy the Vampire Slayer*. Bays attributed this to their being \"huge fans\" and to those casts representing \"a big talent pool\".[34]\n\n\nOn March 4, 2011, CBS announced that the show had been renewed for two more seasons,[35] with the seventh season premiering with back-to-back episodes on September 19, 2011.[36]\n\n\nOn July 27, 2011, the FX channel announced it had picked up the series for syndication. On September 5, 2011, FX began airing the series.[37]\n\n\nCast members had said the show would not run longer than eight seasons,[38] but a ninth season was secured in December 2012 amid tense negotiations with the studios and the actors\u2014especially Segel, who had wanted to move on to other ventures after the eighth season.[39][40] During these negotiations, Bays and Thomas originally approached the eighth season as if it were the show's last, but had a \"Plan B\" in case the show were renewed.[41] After producers secured a ninth season, they implemented plans to secretly cast the titular future mother, with Cristin Milioti eventually winning the role, having bested at least two other contenders.[12] Milioti first appeared in the last scene in the season eight finale \"Something New\" and was a regular cast member in the show's final season.[42] This was the first time the show had expanded its core roster.[42][43]\n\n\nIn January 2013, *How I Met Your Mother* was renewed for a ninth season.[44] Carter Bays told *Entertainment Weekly* that season 9 would \"feature some of the most non-linear episodes we've ever done\".[45]\n\n\nThe season 9 premiere episode aired on September 23, 2013, and the one-hour series finale aired on March 31, 2014.[46]\n\n\n\n## Cast and characters[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of *How I Met Your Mother* characters\n\n* Main cast\n* ![Josh Radnor Ted Mosby](image)\n\nJosh Radnor   \nTed Mosby\n* ![Jason Segel](image)\n\nJason Segel  \nMarshall Eriksen\n* ![Cobie Smulders](image)\n\nCobie Smulders  \nRobin Scherbatsky\n* ![Neil Patrick Harris](image)\n\nNeil Patrick Harris  \nBarney Stinson\n* ![Alyson Hannigan](image)\n\nAlyson Hannigan  \nLily Aldrin\n* ![Cristin Milioti](image)\n\nCristin Milioti  \nThe Mother\n\n\n* Josh Radnor as Ted Mosby, an architect, college professor and the central character of the series. He tells the story of his adult years from his late twenties to his mid thirties, and all the obstacles he overcomes before he meets \"The One\" (the Mother). This story is told by the Older Ted Mosby, and narrator of the series, Bob Saget. Ted moved to New York City with his friends Marshall and Lily after graduating from Wesleyan University. In New York, he met Barney (at the urinal of MacLaren's) and Robin, to whom he was immediately attracted. Ted is on a quest for happiness and \"The One\", the woman he will marry. He has many relationships, one with Robin, that reveal the qualities he wants in his future wife. At the end of each relationship, with levity, he reflects on what went wrong. Although hope to find \"the one\" diminishes with each failed relationship, Ted does not give up. He has more elegant and higher-class interests than his friends. He goes to great lengths to profess his love to the women in his life, but they all falter eventually. Despite these qualities, Ted often acts immaturely, such as in wild activities with Barney. In the show's finale, he says that, in Tracy, he had met the love of his life (the titular Mother), but only after he is finished telling the story does he accept that he is ready to move on and admit he is still in love with Robin.\n* Jason Segel as Marshall Eriksen, Ted Mosby's best friend. Marshall and Ted were roommates at Wesleyan, and remained living together when they moved to New York. In season 2 Marshall marries Lily, with whom he has been in love since his freshman year of college; they have a child during season 7. Marshall was born in St. Cloud, Minnesota, where his family and culture are the foundation of major conflicts he faces in the series. He has an interest in the paranormal and mythical creatures, particularly Sasquatch. His dream to be an environmental lawyer conflicts with his immediate need for money, such as for his wedding and to raise his children. He however, eventually switches from his corporate job, to his dream, environmental lawyer job, taking the pay cut willingly to help protect the environment. By the end of the sitcom, he has become a New York supreme court judge.\n* Cobie Smulders as Robin Scherbatsky, a news anchor trying to make it as a journalist who dates both Ted and Barney. Robin emigrated from Canada to take a job at a news station and met Ted at MacLaren's; her Canadian background is a source of many jokes from her friends, for instance, \u2018Robin Sparkles\u2019 which was her stage name as a Canadian teenage pop-star. She is very career-centric and rejects traditional roles, such as getting married and having kids. Robin often drinks scotch and smokes cigars, and is an avid gun fan. She and Barney get engaged and marry in the penultimate episode of the series, but divorce in the first part of the series finale, three years later. Smulders's husband Taran Killam appeared in six episodes as Gary Blauman.\n* Neil Patrick Harris as Barney Stinson, a serial playboy, using his relative wealth and an array of outrageous strategies to seduce women with no intention of engaging in a relationship. His catchphrases include 'Suit Up' and 'Legen-wait-for-it-Dary'. He is Ted's other best friend. Abandoned by his father at a young age, Barney has abandonment issues and clings to his friends. He tells extravagant lies about events in his life as a defense mechanism for his substandard childhood. He marries Robin in the penultimate episode of the series but they divorce after three years in the two-part series finale. In 2020, a failed one-night stand gives him a daughter, Ellie. Harris' husband David Burtka appeared in seven episodes as Scooter.\n* Alyson Hannigan as Lily Aldrin, a kindergarten teacher, aspiring artist, and Marshall's wife. She is terrible at keeping secrets and can be manipulative at times. She marries Marshall in season 2 and gives birth to Marvin in season 7. Though appearing sweet and cute, Lily can be quite unexpectedly fierce. Her best girl friend is Robin, whom she met through Ted as he dated Robin. Hannigan's husband Alexis Denisof appeared in ten episodes as Sandy Rivers.\n* Cristin Milioti as The Mother, the titular character who is Ted's future wife. She makes her first official appearance in Season 8, and gradually meets all the characters throughout Season 9 leading up to her meeting Ted.\n\n\n## Season synopsis[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of *How I Met Your Mother* episodes\n\n| Season | Episodes | Originally aired | Rank |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| First aired | Last aired |\n| 1 | 22 | September\u00a019,\u00a02005\u00a0(2005-09-19) | May\u00a015,\u00a02006\u00a0(2006-05-15) | 85 |\n| 2 | 22 | September\u00a018,\u00a02006\u00a0(2006-09-18) | May\u00a014,\u00a02007\u00a0(2007-05-14) | 61 |\n| 3 | 20 | September\u00a024,\u00a02007\u00a0(2007-09-24) | May\u00a019,\u00a02008\u00a0(2008-05-19) | 70 |\n| 4 | 24 | September\u00a022,\u00a02008\u00a0(2008-09-22) | May\u00a018,\u00a02009\u00a0(2009-05-18) | 49 |\n| 5 | 24 | September\u00a021,\u00a02009\u00a0(2009-09-21) | May\u00a024,\u00a02010\u00a0(2010-05-24) | 42 |\n| 6 | 24 | September\u00a020,\u00a02010\u00a0(2010-09-20) | May\u00a016,\u00a02011\u00a0(2011-05-16) | 48 |\n| 7 | 24 | September\u00a019,\u00a02011\u00a0(2011-09-19) | May\u00a014,\u00a02012\u00a0(2012-05-14) | 45 |\n| 8 | 24 | September\u00a024,\u00a02012\u00a0(2012-09-24) | May\u00a013,\u00a02013\u00a0(2013-05-13) | 42 |\n| 9 | 24 | September\u00a023,\u00a02013\u00a0(2013-09-23) | March\u00a031,\u00a02014\u00a0(2014-03-31) | 28 |\n\n\n\n\n\n### Season 1[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *How I Met Your Mother* (season 1)\n\nIn 2030, Ted Mosby (voiced by Bob Saget) sits his children down to tell them the story of how he met their mother.\n\n\nThe series begins in September 2005 with Ted (Josh Radnor) as a single, 27-year-old architect living with his two best friends from his college years: Marshall Eriksen (Jason Segel), a law student, and Lily Aldrin (Alyson Hannigan), a kindergarten teacher and an aspiring artist. Lily and Marshall have been dating for almost nine years when Marshall finally proposes. Their engagement causes Ted to think about marriage and finding his soul mate, much to the disgust of his self-appointed best friend Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris), whom he met in the restroom at a bar four years earlier. Barney is a serial womanizer who concocts elaborate con games, usually involving costumes and fake identities, designed to bed women, only to lose interest in them immediately afterward.\n\n\nTed begins his search for his perfect soul mate and meets an ambitious young reporter from Canada, Robin Scherbatsky (Cobie Smulders), with whom he quickly falls in love. Robin, however, does not want to rush into a relationship and the two decide to be friends. Future Ted reveals that Robin is not the mother after referring to her as \"Aunt Robin\".\n\n\nTed begins dating a baker, Victoria (Ashley Williams), whom he meets at Stuart and Claudia's wedding, causing Robin to become jealous, and realize she does have feelings for Ted. Victoria is offered a fellowship in pastry-making, moves to Germany and she and Ted try a long-distance relationship. Once Ted learns Robin has feelings for him, he tells her he broke up with Victoria, even though he has not. They almost have sex when Victoria calls and Robin answers, mistaking Ted's phone for her own. Ted and Victoria then break up and an angry Robin distances herself from Ted, but they eventually reconcile and decide to date.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Lily begins to wonder if she has missed any opportunities because of her relationship with Marshall, and decides to pursue an art fellowship in San Francisco, breaking up with Marshall in the process. The season ends with Ted returning to the apartment, the morning after spending the night with Robin for the first time, to find Marshall sitting in the rain with Lily's engagement ring, devastated by their sudden break-up after nine years. Marshall must then call off their wedding.\n\n\n\n### Season 2[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *How I Met Your Mother* (season 2)\n\nTed and Robin are now a couple; meanwhile, a heartbroken Marshall tries to continue his life without Lily. After enduring numerous emotional breakdowns, Marshall's friends step in, and Barney, using sly catchphrases and pick-up lines, tries to get Marshall back in the dating game. Marshall becomes Barney's new \u2018wingman\u2019 as Ted is now in a relationship with Robin. Barney mentors Marshall in the art of flirting with women. Marshall fails at impressing women, but he finally obtains a barista's number. Later, Lily, after finally realizing she is not meant to be an artist, returns to New York. They remain separated as Marshall begins to date another girl, the barista whose number he earned, described by the gang as having 'crazy eyes'. The date with the girl does not end well and eventually leads to Lily and Marshall becoming reunited, and their engagement eventually resumes. When Robin refuses to go to the mall or explain why, Marshall suspects she is married, and Barney suspects she has performed in adult films. They bet on it, appointing Lily as \"Slap Bet Commissioner.\" Lily oversees the search for the truth, as they discover that Robin was a teenage pop star named \"Robin Sparkles\", and Marshall eventually earns the right to slap Barney five times whenever he wishes. He uses one slap immediately and another later in the season. It is revealed that Barney has a gay African American half-brother named James (Wayne Brady) and, unaware that his mother lied to him, believes that Bob Barker is his father. As a result of this he takes a trip to California to be a contestant on *The Price Is Right* to meet his \"father\". While on the show, Barney wins all the prizes and gives them to Lily and Marshall as a 'happy early wedding' present.\n\n\nIn the season finale, Ted reveals to Barney that he and Robin have been broken up for some time due to their conflicting views on marriage and children. They did not tell anyone, in order to avoid taking attention away from Lily and Marshall's wedding. The season ends with Barney's excitement by the prospect of being an unfettered single man with Ted again. Barney's final words are \"this is going to be legen- wait for it...\".\n\n\n\n### Season 3[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *How I Met Your Mother* (season 3)\n\nBarney begins the season with the word, \"-dary!\" Robin returns from a trip to Argentina with her new boyfriend, Gael (Enrique Iglesias), and Ted must adjust to life as just her friend, while watching Robin and Gael fawning over each other. Marshall and Lily decide to move out on their own, falling in love with a place they cannot afford. Marshall is fighting his temptation to take a corporate job with high pay and focusing instead to follow his dream of becoming an environmental lawyer to protect the world from pollution. Robin learns of Lily's bad credit rating due to her compulsive shopping for designer brands, and forces Lily to tell Marshall. Despite this, they are able to finally secure their dream apartment, in Dowisetrepla, only to discover it is in a bad location (DOwnWInd of the SEwage TREatment PLAnt) and more poorly constructed than they thought (the floor is tilted). Barney is slapped for the third time on Thanksgiving, which Marshall dubs \"Slapsgiving.\"\n\n\nTed tells his children he met their mother through a story concerning her yellow umbrella. He finds the umbrella at a club and takes it home after attending a St. Patrick's Day party where his future wife was, although they did not meet. Ted attempts to woo Stella (Sarah Chalke), a dermatologist he sees to remove an embarrassing butterfly tattoo. This culminates in a \"two-minute date,\" which incorporates small talk, dinner, a movie, coffee, two cab rides, and a goodnight kiss. Robin sleeps with Barney after he comforts her following a break-up with a past Canadian love; Ted is infuriated, and decides to stop being friends with Barney. Meanwhile, an unknown woman begins to sabotage Barney's attempts to hook up. His saboteur is revealed to be Abby (Britney Spears), Stella's receptionist, with a vendetta against him for not calling her after they had sex.\n\n\nIn the season finale, Ted gets into a car accident and ends up in hospital after breaking up with Stella. Subsequently, Barney is hit by a bus while he is on his way to visit Ted and receives treatment in the same hospital. Ted realizes Barney cares about him and they renew their friendship. Barney's true feelings for Robin are revealed while Ted proposes to Stella in an arcade with a toy kangaroo.\n\n\n\n### Season 4[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *How I Met Your Mother* (season 4)\n\nStella says yes to Ted's proposal. Robin takes a new job in Japan, but quickly resigns and returns to New York to attend Ted's wedding, after realizing how much she misses her friends. Stella leaves Ted at the altar to get back together with Tony (Jason Jones), the father of her daughter. Barney struggles with his feelings for Robin as his company shifts him to the management team of a new acquisition, Goliath National Bank (GNB), where Marshall has accepted a position.\n\n\nMarshall and Lily move to their new apartment and debate over whether or not they are ready to have children. Robin is threatened to be deported for not having a job in her field, which opens an opportunity for Barney to spend time with Robin. Robin gets a job as an anchor for a 4 AM news show after Barney submits her video resume, and becomes roommates with Ted. Ted and Robin decide to sleep together constantly so they will not fight over each other's bad co-living habits. Barney attempts to make them stop fighting to prevent this, revealing to Ted his love for Robin.\n\n\nTed finds out Lily has sabotaged all of his relationships with anyone she does not approve of and indirectly may have inspired his breakup with Robin. Robin and Ted end up talking about it, causing their friendship to begin moving toward a positive note. After Barney finally sleeps with his 200th woman (and rubs it in the face of the childhood bully who taunted him into pursuing it), he begins to question the purpose of the remainder of his life, leaving him more certain of his feelings for Robin. Barney secures Ted a job to design the new Goliath National Bank headquarters. When the company later suspends the project, Marshall and Barney try to hide this fact from Ted. Ted starts his own architectural design company, Mosbius Designs, after getting laid off; however, he is too afraid of failing and refuses to call clients.\n\n\nTed, while carrying the yellow umbrella, bumps into Stella and Tony. Tony later decides to visit him, sympathizing with Ted over his loss of Stella. Tony offers Ted a job as a professor of architecture at Columbia University, which Ted initially turns down.\n\n\nIn the season finale Robin finds out that Barney loves her, and initially refuses to commit to anything but a sex-only relationship; they seemingly end up together anyway. Ted decides that being an architect is leading nowhere, and finally decides instead to become a college professor. The finale ends with Ted preparing to teach his first class and Future Ted revealing to his children that one of the women in the class is their mother.\n\n\n\n### Season 5[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *How I Met Your Mother* (season 5)\n\nTed begins his job as a professor of architecture, standing in the middle of a classroom\u00a0\u2013 although the mother was present, it turns out to be an economics class as he's in the wrong lecture hall. Barney and Robin have had a sexual relationship throughout the summer and Lily locks them in a room, forcing them to come to terms with their relationship. After a rough patch they decide to break up. Robin describes it instead as \"two friends getting back together.\" Barney immediately goes back to his old ways, using the playbook to score with women. Throughout the season Barney and Robin show feelings of regret over their break-up.\n\n\nTed dates a graduate student named Cindy (Rachel Bilson) and it is revealed her roommate is his future wife. Robin meets Don Frank (Benjamin Koldyke), her new co-anchor on her 4 AM TV show. Though she initially dislikes him, the two start dating and eventually she moves in with him. At the end of the season they break up when Don takes a job in Chicago \u2014 a job which Robin had previously turned down to stay in New York with Don. Robin moves back into Ted's apartment. Lily's father, Mickey (Chris Elliott), who was absent during her childhood, makes an appearance at Thanksgiving. Mickey and Lily are able to mend their relationship at the end of the meal, where Marshall uses his fourth slap on Barney. Ted discovered that Tony, who stole Stella away from Ted at the altar, wrote a movie on Ted and Stella's relationship. The movie, \"The Wedding Bride,\" portrays Tony as the hero and Ted as the villain. The movie becomes popular and Ted unexpectedly sees it while on a date with another girl. He is infuriated by how he is portrayed in the movie, and views the actual story as the complete opposite. Ted buys a house, which needs to be fixed up badly, but is later revealed to be the future home for him and his children.\n\n\nLily and Marshall are still unsure about having children. After watching four doppelgangers of their group (Lesbian Robin, Moustache Marshall, Stripper Lily and Mexican Wrestler Ted) they decide to leave the big decision to the universe's \"infinite wisdom\" and start trying when they have seen Barney's doppelganger.\n\n\nIn the season finale, Barney disguises himself to have sex with a girl from every country in the world, and Lily and Marshall mistake him for the final doppelganger. When Marshall finds out, he decides not to tell Lily, fearing she will want to wait even longer to have children. Lily eventually finds out and decides to wait. Lily thinks she sees Barney's doppelganger as a hot dog vendor, which causes the group to realize she is seeing what she wants to see, and play along. Eventually Barney agrees having babies is not a stupid idea and Lily and Marshall should go forth. The season ends with Lily asking Marshall to \"put a baby in my belly\".\n\n\n\n### Season 6[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *How I Met Your Mother* (season 6)\n\nIn the season opening, Ted sees Cindy again with a girl who he thinks to be her roommate, but she turns out to be Cindy's girlfriend whom she later marries. After prodding by Barney, Ted is eventually hired by GNB once more as the architect of the bank's new headquarters, which was originally scrapped in Season 4. However, he encounters opposition when he meets Zoey Pierson (Jennifer Morrison), a woman who is protesting against GNB for selecting a decrepit hotel, the Arcadian, to be torn down for the headquarters. Over the season, Ted's encounters with Zoey eventually blossom into a relationship after she divorces her rich husband, the Captain (Kyle MacLachlan). However, when their relationship is challenging and turbulent, they break up, leading to Ted supporting the Arcadian's demolition.\n\n\nHaving agreed to conceive a baby at the end of the previous season, Lily and Marshall keep having sex, hoping she will get pregnant. Around Christmas, they have a false alarm and later seek fertility testing. The fertility specialist, Dr. Stangel, turns out to be Barney's doppelganger, fulfilling their promise with the universe in regard to their decision to have a child. However, tragedy strikes when Marshall's father passes away, leaving him devastated and the gang comforting him. Marshall tries to get over his father's death and live again. Despite a pledge to Lily to work harder for their future, Marshall resigns from GNB and follows his dream of being an environmental lawyer. Zoey also hires him as her lawyer in what became a futile battle to save the Arcadian.\n\n\nBarney finally admits to the gang that Bob Barker is not his real father, especially when his mother decides to sell the house he grew up in and his brother, James, meets his own father. Loretta offers the identity of Barney's father on a sheet of paper, but Barney tears this up after realizing her efforts as a single mother. At the funeral of Marshall's father, Barney tells Loretta that he wants to see his father at last. The man, Jerry Whittaker (John Lithgow), is eventually revealed to be someone whom Barney thought was his uncle. Barney, who remembers Jerry as a fun-loving man, is disappointed after learning how Jerry has grown out of his free-wheeling ways. Although he tries to bring back Jerry's old behaviors, Barney admits that he wants to settle down someday. He is also introduced to Nora (Nazanin Boniadi), a co-worker of Robin, for whom he develops feelings. After an initial falling out, the two reconcile at the end of the season after Barney asks her for coffee.\n\n\nRobin continues to work at her talk show, *Come On, Get Up, New York!*, but the presence of a new hyperactive co-host forces her to leave. She is accepted as a researcher in another network, *World Wide News*. The gang also discovers more of her past as the Canadian pop star Robin Sparkles. Robin also encounters a man (Michael Trucco) she has had a secret crush on since first seeing him when she and Ted were dating, and Future Ted hints that they will see more of him later.\n\n\nIn the season finale, Ted makes the decision that he wants to get back with Zoey. Robin and Barney try to stop them from getting back together. Marshall's interview goes wrong as food poisoning hits him during the meeting; Lily's similar sickness was thought to be food poisoning as well, but is revealed to be morning sickness, as she has become pregnant. Barney and Robin get closure by helping Ted not get back together with Zoey. Short scenes during the season premiere and finale feature a wedding set sometime in the future, where Ted will meet his future wife. In the final scene of the season, the groom is revealed to be Barney.\n\n\n\n### Season 7[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *How I Met Your Mother* (season 7)\n\nSeason seven opens with another flash forward, in which Ted is helping Barney get ready for his wedding to a still-unknown bride. In the present, Marshall gets a job in environmental law while Lily's pregnancy progresses. Barney proves to Nora that he can be a good boyfriend to her, while Robin is revealed to still have feelings for Barney. After a court case for assault, Robin receives mandated therapy. Robin meets a therapist, Kevin (Kal Penn), and they start to date. Meanwhile, after a period of unemployment since leaving GNB, Marshall finally manages to land his dream job at a top environmental law firm. After losing a bet, Barney is forced to wear a tie with a duck pattern on it (nicknamed the 'Ducky Tie') which he hates. Marshall allows him to take it off when meeting Nora's parents on the condition that Barney has three slaps added to the one still remaining from the Slap Bet. Marshall uses two slaps immediately, leaving two left.\n\n\nWhile reminiscing about Hurricane Irene, Lily and Marshall reveal that they conceived their baby in Barney's apartment, and Barney and Robin end up sleeping together. Barney and Robin decide to break up with their partners, but Robin reneges on the deal, returning to Kevin and leaving Barney alone and heartbroken. Robin has a pregnancy scare at Thanksgiving and tells Barney the child is his, since she and Kevin had not yet slept together. However, Robin's doctor informs her that she cannot have children at all. Kevin, who wants children, proposes to Robin, who decides that they must break up. Ted comforts Robin and reveals he still loves her, but the gesture is unrequited. Eventually, she moves out to give him some space.\n\n\nMarshall and Lily decide they want to move to Long Island, after Lily's paternal grandparents offer them their house there. Eventually, they move back to the old apartment in New York City after realizing suburban life is not for them. Ted gives them his apartment because he believes he cannot move on from Robin while living there, while he and Robin become estranged and do not speak for several weeks. Robin is eventually offered a news anchor job and subsequently achieves recognition after preventing a helicopter she is flying in from crashing.\n\n\nBarney starts dating a stripper named Quinn (Becki Newton), to the group's initial apprehension. The gang begins to meddle in their relationship, but Barney and Quinn outsmart their attempts and win their approval. Quinn moves in with Barney, while Ted rents Quinn's old apartment. Lily goes into labor and frantically calls Barney and Marshall, who are out at a casino in Atlantic City and heavily intoxicated. Barney helps Marshall arrive in time for Lily's delivery and chooses the middle name for the baby, Marvin Waitforit Eriksen. Ted and Robin's friendship also recovers as a result of Marvin's birth. As the season concludes, Marshall and Lily begin a new family with their baby, Marvin. Barney proposes to Quinn performing an extravagant magic trick in airport security. Ted contacts his old girlfriend Victoria; unhappy with her own impending wedding, she leaves her fianc\u00e9 for Ted and the pair drive off into the sunset. A final flash forward shows the day of Barney's wedding, where Robin is revealed as the bride.\n\n\n\n### Season 8[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *How I Met Your Mother* (season 8)\n\nTed visits Robin on the day of her wedding to Barney, causing him to remember how he and Victoria ran away from her wedding to be together. The summer is spent with Ted, Barney, and Robin enjoying their current relationships; however, all subsequently break up with their partners. Victoria splits up with Ted over his friendship with Robin, Barney and Quinn break up due to their inability to trust each other, and Robin breaks up with Nick realizing his immaturity. Robin and Barney kiss but decide not to get together, despite Barney's wishes. Barney then begins dating Robin's hated co-worker Patrice (Ellen D. Williams), a relationship later exposed as a ruse to make Robin realize her true feelings for him. In a culminating scene, Barney proposes to Robin, who says yes.\n\n\nMarshall and Lily attempt to get used to being parents, which causes a brief estrangement from the gang as Baby Marvin takes up the majority of their time. Lily's father Mickey becomes Marvin's nanny, freeing the two up to spend more time with their friends. The Captain, ex-husband of Ted's old girlfriend Zoey, offers Lily a job as an art consultant after she identifies a painting that made a huge profit for him. Lily accepts, happy to finally achieve her dream of having a job in the art industry, while Marshall decides to apply to become a judge. The Captain offers Lily a year's work in Rome, which she accepts with Marshall's blessing. However, just before Barney and Robin's wedding, Marshall is informed that his application to become a judge has been granted, a development that would require them to stay in the US.\n\n\nTed briefly dates Jeanette (Abby Elliott), a girl who stalked him after he appeared on the cover of *New York Magazine* for designing GNB's headquarters. He quickly realizes he's made a mistake and breaks up with her. Ted's feelings of loneliness grow, especially as he is now the only single member of the group, and he decides he is truly ready to settle down. He argues with Lily over hiring a DJ or a band for Barney and Robin's wedding, but is forced to provide a band at short notice when Lily concedes the argument. During a chance meeting on the subway, Cindy offers the services of her roommate's wedding band. This roommate is Ted's future wife.\n\n\nAs the week of the wedding approaches, Robin has doubts about marrying Barney and shares an emotional moment with Ted. Feeling guilty, Ted realizes he cannot be around Barney and Robin after they are married and decides to move to Chicago the day after the wedding. The season concludes with everyone traveling to Barney and Robin's wedding, including the mother of Ted's children (revealed on screen for the first time and portrayed by Cristin Milioti), who is seen buying a train ticket to the venue and holding her yellow umbrella.\n\n\n\n### Season 9[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *How I Met Your Mother* (season 9)\n\nWith the exception of the last episode, the entirety of season nine takes place in the 56 hours leading up to Barney and Robin's wedding.\n\n\nMarshall, who is stuck in Minnesota, desperately tries to find a way to get to the wedding in time. Meanwhile, in Farhampton, the time is slowly counting down to the wedding, with a new problem arising in almost every episode. It is revealed that Lily is pregnant and that she and Marshall will have a daughter. It is also revealed that Ted's children are named Penny and Luke. In the 200th episode, the Mother's eight years before meeting Ted are revealed, while later episodes give viewers a glimpse of Ted and the Mother together in flash forward scenes. Also, Marshall uses his final two slaps from the slap bet: the first being used as an apology present for missing the rehearsal dinner, and the second when Barney begins to panic just before the beginning of the wedding ceremony.\n\n\nIn the series finale, it is revealed that after three years of marriage, Barney and Robin decided to divorce. Barney ends up later fathering a child during a one-night stand. Marshall eventually becomes a judge, and he and Lily have three children. Ted's wife, whose name is revealed to be Tracy McConnell, dies of an unknown illness in 2024, six years prior to the time of Ted telling his children the full story of how they met. Upon finishing the story, at the urging of his kids, Ted decides to ask Robin out. Alluding to the first episode, the finale ends with Robin, as she looks out of her apartment window to see Ted holding the blue french horn, smiling with tears in her eyes.\n\n\nFollowing backlash from fans over the ending of the series, an alternative ending was cut together and released on the Season 9 DVD, in which future Ted narrates over the scene in which Ted and Tracy meet at the train station, recapping all major events from the series. He delivers the final line \"and that kids is how I met your mother\", and the episode ends, completely cutting the final scene with Penny and Luke.\n\n\n\n## Critical reception[edit]\n\n\nThe first season was met with generally favorable reviews from critics, although some compared the series unfavorably to *Friends*. On Metacritic, a review aggregation site that collected 25 reviews for the series, it scored a 69 out of 100.[47] Michael Abernethy of *PopMatters* gave the season a negative review, writing that \"The comedy that does occur in *How I Met Your Mother* isn't enough to compensate for its inconsistencies.\"[48] Tom Shales of *The Washington Post* gave the season a lukewarm review, saying it's \"a little better than most other sitcoms, past and present -- especially those featuring wacky urban friends in their twenties experiencing the bittersweet mysteries of life.\"[49] Melanie Macfarlane of the *Seattle Post-Intelligencer* gave the season a positive review, saying the show \"may not break any comedic ground, but it's the sort of comfortable, reliable hitter CBS needs on Monday nights.\"[50]\n\n\nThe second season received critical acclaim. Staci Krause of IGN gave the season a positive review,[51] calling it \"great\".[52]\n\n\nThe third season was met with mostly positive reviews.[53] Michelle Zoromski of IGN gave the season a positive review, saying that \"the season was fun and clever, a good, consistent flow from the first two seasons\".[54]\n\n\nThe fourth season received critical acclaim. Michelle Zoromski of IGN gave Season 4 an overall rating of 8.5 out of 10, stating that \"This fourth season seemed to settle down the chase for the titular mother. While Ted was busy dating Stella, the gang settled into many stand alone episodes which were every bit as entertaining as episodes devoted to Ted's love life\". Zoromski went on to say: \"A stellar Robin-Marshall episode, titled 'Little Minnesota', makes it clear that these two do not get enough screen time together. With Robin homesick and unemployed (and at risk of being deported), this pairing brought out the best Robin Sparkles reference of the season, when Marshall leads a rousing karaoke version of 'Let's Go to the Mall!'\"[55]\n\n\nThe fifth season received mixed reviews. Cindy McLennan of *Television Without Pity* gave the season a mixed review, and at the end of the season wrote: \"I'm okay with any given season not being primarily focused on mother-meeting, but this season, the characters seemed to regress -- particularly Barney and Ted. Usually, when a season ends, I have to deal with a week or two weeks' worth of letdown. Right now, all I'm feeling is relief.\"[56]\n\n\nThe sixth season received generally positive reviews.[57] Justin Fowler of *Later Reviews* gave the season a positive review, saying that the season was \"a pretty good season of television\" and better than the \"poor\" fifth season. He also said that \"Seventeen out of the 24 episodes are what I would consider good\".[58]\n\n\nThe seventh season received mixed reviews. Alan Sepinwall gave the season a mixed review and criticized the flash-forwards throughout the season, saying that \"the show is just much, much stronger when its stories dwell on matters of the present or the past, and where the writers don't have to act like magicians trying to keep the audience from figuring out how the trick works. And the finale affirmed that belief for me. The parts that had little or nothing to do with things to come were quite good; the parts that were all about the future made me roll my eyes and ask, for the umpteenth time, 'Really? This is where you're going with this?'\"[59]\n\n\nThe eighth season received mixed reviews and is often considered the worst season of the series. Rotten Tomatoes reported that 54% of critics gave the show a positive review. The consensus reads: \"*How I Met Your Mother* wears out its welcome this season, with an anticlimactic reveal and rote, less-than-fruitful humor.\"[60]\n\n\nThe ninth season received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics, though fans found it worse than prior seasons.[61] Rotten Tomatoes reported that 80% of critics gave the show a positive review, with an average rating of 7.3 out of 10.[62] Gareth Mitchell at \"House of Geekery\" responded negatively, mostly criticizing the structure of the season, stating that they are \"struggling to come up with stories that last out the 22 minutes\".[63]\n\n\nThe finale of the show received a largely negative reaction from critics and fans. Some complained that the last few seasons (particularly the final season before the finale which took place over one weekend) had built towards an end game that was discarded within the hour-long episode, while others defended it as true to both the initial concept of the show and to life itself.[64] In the years succeeding its airing, it continued to be singled out as one of the worst television series finales,[65][66][67] e.g., topping *USA Today*'s list of \"Worst Series Finales of All Time\".[68]\n\n\n\n## Tie-ins[edit]\n\n\n### Books[edit]\n\n\n* *The Bro Code*, cited by Barney many times throughout the series, is a set of written rules for bros to follow, and has been published as a tie-in novel, an audiobook,[69] an iPhone Application and an Android Application. Barney alleges it was written by Barnabus Stinson, a contemporary of George Washington and Benjamin Franklin. Many of the rules listed in this book also appear in the show's closing vanity cards in syndication.\n* *Bro on the Go*, a companion to *The Bro Code*, released in 2009.[70]\n* *Bro Code for Parents: What to Expect When You're Awesome*, released in 2012.[71]\n* *The Playbook,* based on the fifth season episode of the same name, by Barney Stinson and Matt Kuhn.[72]\n* *How I Met Your Mother and Philosophy*, released in 2013.[73]\n\n\n### Soundtracks[edit]\n\n\nMain article: How I Met Your Music (Original Songs from the Hit Series \"How I Met Your Mother\")\n\n* A soundtrack album entitled *How I Met Your Music: Original Songs from the Hit Series* was released digitally to iTunes on September 24, 2012, featuring songs from the first seven seasons[74]\n* A second soundtrack album entitled *How I Met Your Music: Deluxe* was released digitally to iTunes on September 23, 2014, featuring songs from the final two seasons.[75]\n\n\n### Pineapple Incident explained[edit]\n\n\nAfter the end of the series, the officials released a short video, explaining the running mystery of the pineapple in \"The Pineapple Incident\", the tenth episode of the first season. The extra footage revealed that a character featured in the 6th season, the Captain (Kyle MacLachlan), had put a pineapple in front of his door as a tradition and Ted took the pineapple while he was drunk.[76]\n\n\n\n### Websites[edit]\n\n\nWebsites were consistently mentioned throughout the How I Met Your Mother series. Many of the websites directly tie in to running gags on the show. CBS turned nearly every website mentioned in the series into a real functioning website. Since the show\u2019s ending in 2014, a majority of the websites remain active.[77]\n\n\n\n* The first Instance of a website tie-in on How I Met Your Mother was on Season 3, Episode 14 'The Bracket' with one of Barney's one-night-stands creating both http://tedmosbyisajerk.com Archived August 12, 2019, at the Wayback Machine [78] and http://tedmosbyisnotajerk.com.[79]\n* In Season 3, Episode 19 'Everything Must Go' Lily is forced to sell her clothes on the internet because she is in serious credit card debt.

Talks of the series being \"shopped\" to other networks emerged.[107][108] Netflix, FOX and NBC were named as possible candidates for picking up the show.[109]\n\n\nUltimately, nothing came of those talks. It was reported that the options on the cast contracts had expired and they had been released from their contracts and co-creator Carter Bays denied any rumors that the spin-off pilot will be reshot. On July 11, 2014, Bays confirmed that the spin-off project was officially dead.[110] Six days later, Nina Tassler said that CBS would \"love the opportunity to take another shot\" at the pilot and that she would continue to \"hound\" Carter Bays and Craig Thomas, even though they shot down the idea of a new version of the project stating that they had both moved on.[111]\n\n\nIn 2016, two years after the project was announced \"dead\", a full script of the pilot episode was leaked online.[112] In 2020, the full pilot episode was also leaked by a Reddit user on the How I Met Your Mother subreddit, which included a modified ending compared to the leaked script from 2016.\n\n\n\n#### *How I Met Your Father*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: How I Met Your Father\n\nOn December 14, 2016, it was reported that Isaac Aptaker and Elizabeth Berger were set to write a new version of the previous spin-off's pilot, re-titled *How I Met Your Father*, with Bays and Thomas serving as executive producers.[113] On March 6, 2017, it was announced that following signing new contracts with 20th Television that would see both Aptaker and Berger being promoted to executive producers and co-showrunners on *This Is Us* alongside Dan Fogelman, their completed spec script for *How I Met Your Father* would be placed on the back burner in light of their new duties.[114]\n\n\nOn August 8, 2017, Fox chairman Dana Walden told *Deadline* that the studio was set to try a third attempt at a spin-off with different writers due to the unavailability of Aptaker and Berger. It was also stated that all ideas from the previous two attempts are not carried over and the new attempt are created from scratch.[115] On August 11, 2017, Deadline reported that Alison Bennett had been selected to write the spin-off. It was also confirmed that this incarnation would be developed under the title used for the Aptaker and Berger project, and that Bays and Thomas are once again attached as executive producers.[116]\n\n\nOn April 21, 2021, it was announced that the spin-off series was ordered by Hulu, with Hilary Duff attached to play lead character Sophie.

He is best known for portraying Ted Mosby on the Emmy Award\u2013winning CBS sitcom *How I Met Your Mother*. He made his writing and directorial debut with the 2010 comedy drama film *Happythankyoumoreplease*, for which he won the Sundance Film Festival Audience Award and was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize.\n\n\nIn 2012, he wrote, directed and starred in his second film, *Liberal Arts*, which premiered at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival. In 2014, Radnor portrayed Isaac in the Broadway play *Disgraced*, which was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Play. He then starred as Dr. Jedediah Foster on the PBS American Civil War drama series *Mercy Street*, Lou Mazzuchelli in the musical series *Rise*, and as Lonny Flash in *Hunters*.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nRadnor was born in Columbus, Ohio to a Jewish family, the son of Carol Radnor (n\u00e9e Hirsch), a high school guidance counselor, and Alan Radnor, a medical malpractice lawyer.[2] Radnor has two sisters, Melanie Radnor Silverman and Joanna Radnor Vilensky.[3]\n\n\nHe grew up in Bexley, Ohio, a suburb of Columbus, and was raised in Conservative Judaism.[4] He attended the Orthodox Jewish day school Columbus Torah Academy before going to Bexley High School[5][6][7] and then Kenyon College, where his school's theater department presented him with the Paul Newman Award and during which he spent a semester (Spring 1995) training at the National Theater Institute at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford, Connecticut. He graduated from Kenyon with a Bachelor of Arts in drama in 1996.[8] Radnor received his Master of Fine Arts degree in acting from New York University's graduate acting program at the Tisch School of the Arts in 1999.[8][9] Radnor participated in an Israel experience program in Tzfat with Livnot U'Lehibanot in 1997.[5]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Radnor and Ben Lee performing\nRadnor was cast as the lead in The WB series *Off Centre*. However, the role was re-cast with Eddie Kaye Thomas before the first episode aired.[10] In 2002, he made his Broadway debut in the stage version of *The Graduate*, succeeding Jason Biggs, opposite Kathleen Turner and Alicia Silverstone. In 2004, Radnor starred in *The Paris Letter* alongside his future *How I Met Your Mother* co-star Neil Patrick Harris.[11] From 2005 to 2014, Radnor starred in *How I Met Your Mother*, his biggest role to date.\n\n\nIn July 2008, he starred opposite Jennifer Westfeldt in the premiere of the play *Finks*,[12] written by Joe Gilford and directed by Charlie Stratton for New York Stage and Film. Radnor made his directorial debut with the film *Happythankyoumoreplease*, where he was both the writer and star of the 2010 comedy-drama.[13]\nHis second directorial effort, *Liberal Arts*, starring himself and Elizabeth Olsen, premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 22, 2012.[14] Radnor appeared in the Broadway production of *Disgraced*, which opened October 23, 2014, at the Lyceum Theatre.[15][16] He is set to direct the sci-fi thriller film *The Leaves*.[17] Radnor is currently starring in the Amazon Prime series, *Hunters*, as Lonny Flash, and on Netflix's *Centaurworld*, as Durpleton.\n\n\nIn October 2016, Radnor also confirmed he is in a band, Radnor and Lee, with Australian musician Ben Lee. Radnor and Lee had known each other for \"twelve or thirteen years after meeting on the set of *How I Met Your Mother*\" eventually writing songs together.[18] Their debut album, *Radnor & Lee* was released on November 10, 2017,[19] \"receiving widespread praise across the board, and cementing the duo as an accomplished pair of artists,\" stated Rolling Stone.[20] On February 19, 2020, Spin announced Radnor and Lee's sophomore album, *Golden State*, out on Flower Moon Records, and premiered the first single \"Outside In.\"[21] American Songwriter later premiered the video for the album's 2nd single, \"Simple Harmony.\" Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the album's release date was pushed back to June 2020.[22]\n\n\nRadnor's debut solo EP, *One More Then I'll Let You Go,* was released on April 16, 2021, on Flower Moon Records. Rolling Stone premiered the first single, \"The High Road,\" March 10, 2021, calling it a \"gently lilting ballad about the breakdown of a friendship on which he sings... which features deep textures of piano, acoustic guitar, organ, and snapping fingers.\"[23] The EP's 2nd single, \"You Feel New,\" premiered on March 31, 2021, with features in Rolling Stone, NPR, American Songwriter and Paste Magazine.[24]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn 2008, Radnor told the *Los Angeles Times*, \"I do Transcendental Meditation, and part of the reason I chose my house is that I thought it would be a great place to meditate.\"[25]\n\n\nRadnor is an avid Cloud Cult fan. He collaborated with the band to make the film *The Seeker* in 2016. Radnor explained, \"What's true for me about a lot of music, but especially true for Cloud Cult's music, is that it stirs up the thing that's already in you and calls it out. If this film is able to do that, I'll sleep well at night.\"[26][27]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n\n\nKey\n| \u2020\n | Denotes productions that have not yet been released\n |\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2001\n | *Not Another Teen Movie* | Tour Guide\n |  |\n| 2008\n | *The Negotiating Table* | WGA Negotiator\n | Short film\n |\n| 2010\n | *Happythankyoumoreplease* | Sam Wexler\n | Also director and writer\n |\n| 2012\n | *Liberal Arts* | Jesse Fisher\n | Also director, writer and producer\n |\n| 2013\n | *Afternoon Delight* | Jeff Boyardee\n |  |\n| 2013\n | *The Galapagos Affair: Satan Came to Eden* | John Garth (voice)\n | Documentary\n |\n| 2016\n | *The Seeker* | Father\n | Also executive producer\n |\n| 2018\n | *Social Animals* | Paul\n |  |\n| 2023\n | *Three Birthdays* | Rob\n |  |\n| 2023\n | *All Happy Families* |  |  |\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2000\n | *Welcome to New York* | Doug\n | Episode: \"The Crier\"\n |\n| 2001\n | *Off Centre* | Mike Platt\n | Unaired pilot\n |\n| 2002\n | *Law & Order* | Robert Kitson\n | Episode: \"Access Nation\"\n |\n| 2002\n | *The Court* | Dylan Hirsch\n | 3 episodes\n |\n| 2003\n | *ER* | Keith\n | Episode: \"The Advocate\"\n |\n| 2003\n | *Six Feet Under* | Will Jaffe\n | Episode: \"The Trap\"\n |\n| 2003\n | *Miss Match* | Andrew Gilbert\n | Episode: \"I Got You Babe\"\n |\n| 2005\n | *Judging Amy* | Justin Barr\n | Episode: \"Too Little, Too Late\"\n |\n| 2005\u201314\n | *How I Met Your Mother* | Ted Mosby | Main role (208 episodes)\n |\n| 2007, 2009\n | *Family Guy* | Ted Mosby (voice)\n | Episodes: \"No Chris Left Behind\"\"Peter's Progress\"\n |\n| 2013\n | *Malviviendo* | Himself/cameo\n | Episode: \"La cosa est\u00e1 muy negra\"\n |\n| 2016\u201317\n | *Mercy Street* | Dr. Jedediah Foster\n | Main role (12 episodes)\n |\n| 2018\n | *Rise* | Lou Mazzuchelli\n | Main role (10 episodes)\n |\n| 2018\n | *Grey's Anatomy* | John\n | Episode: \"Momma Knows Best\"\n |\n| 2020\u201323\n | *Hunters* | Lonny Flash\n | Main role (18 episodes)\n |\n| 2021\n | *Centaurworld* | Durpleton (voice)\n | Main role (18 episodes)\n |\n| 2022\n | *Fleishman Is in Trouble* | Adam\n | Recurring\n |\n\n\n### Music videos[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year | Title | Artist | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2016 | \"Let Me Be Your Girl\" | Rachael Yamagata | Director[28] |\n| 2017 | \"Be Like the Being\" | Radnor and Lee | Director\n |\n| 2021 | \"Afternoon\" | Cinders | Director\n |\n\n\n### Stage[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Location\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2002\n | *The Graduate* | Benjamin Braddock\n | Plymouth Theatre[29] |\n| 2004\n | *The Paris Letter* | Sam Arlen / Young Sandy\n | Kirk Douglas Theater |\n| 2011\n | *She Loves Me* | Georg Nowack\n | Roundabout Theatre Company[29] |\n| 2014\u20132015\n | *Disgraced* | Isaac\n | Lyceum Theatre |\n| 2016\n | *The Babylon Line* | Aaron Port\n | Lincoln Center\n |\n| 2018\n | *Little Shop of Horrors* | Seymour Krelborn\n | Kennedy Center |\n\n\n## Awards and nominations[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Work\n | Award\n | Result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2010\n | *Happythankyoumoreplease* | Sundance Film Festival Audience Award | Won\n |\n| Sundance Film Festival Grand Jury Award | Nominated\n |\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\n### Radnor and Lee[edit]\n\n\n* *Radnor and Lee* (2017, Gold Village Entertainment)\n* *Golden State* (2020, Flower Moon Records)\n\n\n### Solo[edit]\n\n\n* *One More Then I'll Let You Go* (2021, Flower Moon Records)\n\n\n* *Eulogy, Vol. 1* (2023, Optimal Grip)\n\n\n### Additional appearances[edit]\n\n\n* Paty Cant\u00fa & Josh Radnor \u2013 \"Mirame\" (2020, Universal Music Mexico)\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Happy birthday, Josh Radnor: See his star sign and read your horoscope\". *Hello!*.

The series revolved around a group of suburban Detroit high school students circa 1980. Segel personally composed a song for his character, Nick, to sing to the lead female character, Lindsay (Linda Cardellini).[20]\n\n\nSegel had recurring roles on *CSI: Crime Scene Investigation* as Neil Jansen and on *Undeclared* as Eric. He played Marshall Eriksen on the CBS sitcom *How I Met Your Mother*; he had previously stated he would move on to other projects in 2013 when his contract expired,[21] but was convinced to finish the series after its ninth season in 2014.[22]\n\n\nSegel made his film debut with *Can't Hardly Wait* in 1998. His other early feature film appearances include *Slackers*, *SLC Punk!*, *The Good Humor Man*, and *Dead Man on Campus*. In 2007, he appeared in *Knocked Up*, directed by *Freaks and Geeks* producer Judd Apatow. Segel starred in the lead role of 2008's *Forgetting Sarah Marshall*, a film he wrote and Apatow produced with Shauna Robertson for Universal Pictures. He also starred in *I Love You, Man*, which was released on March 20, 2009, by DreamWorks.[23]\n\n\nIn *Forgetting Sarah Marshall*, Segel's character writes a \"Dracula\" musical performed by puppets. He also appeared in the most prominent scene containing full frontal nudity in the film.[24] In an interview,[25] he stated that the Dracula musical with puppets, as well as being broken up with while naked, were real experiences he wrote into the movie. Those cloth creatures were custom-made by the Jim Henson Company, and the experience emboldened Segel to pitch his concept for a Muppets movie.[26] Segel performed a song from the film, \"Dracula's Lament\", on the 1000th episode of *The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson*.[27]\n\n\n\n![A man smiles as he waves](image)Segel at the Australian premiere of *The Muppets* in Sydney in 2011\nFor the 2010 comedy *Get Him to the Greek*, Segel co-wrote most of the soundtrack's music which was performed by the fictional celebrity singer, Aldous Snow, including Infant Sorrow. He also appeared on *The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson* and sang an original song entitled \"Wonky Eyed Girl\".[28]\n\n\nIn 2010, he voiced Gru's arch-rival Vector in the Universal's CGI animated film, *Despicable Me* and appeared as \"Horatio\" in a fantasy comedy film *Gulliver's Travels* directed by Rob Letterman and very loosely based on Part One of the 18th-century novel of the same name by Jonathan Swift. Segel appeared in *Bad Teacher*, starring Cameron Diaz, which opened in June 2011. He played gym teacher and thwarted suitor Russell Gettis.[29] Along with Nicholas Stoller, Segel approached Disney in 2007 to write the latest *Muppets* film. Disney was unsure on how to take the request, as Segel had just done frontal nudity in *Forgetting Sarah Marshall*, but after realizing that he was a fan, the project was approved. Segel stated that he wanted to do the film because the last film in the series to be released in theaters was *Muppets from Space* in 1999, and he felt that the younger generation was missing out on enjoying one of his childhood favorites.[30]\n\n\nSegel decided not to star in the sequel to *The Muppets*, *Muppets Most Wanted*.[31] He filmed *The Five-Year Engagement*, with Emily Blunt, in spring 2011, in Michigan, and the film was released on April 27, 2012.[32]\n\n\nIn 2013, Segel revealed he was working on a series of young adult novels, based on a story he conceived when he was 21.[33] In the fall of 2014, the first novel of the series *Nightmares!*, co-written with Kirsten Miller, was released, with the followup coming out the following year.[34][35]\n\n\nIn 2015, Segel received praise[36][37][38] for his portrayal of the late author David Foster Wallace in the independent biographical drama film *The End of the Tour*. For his performance, he earned an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Male Lead.[39]\n\n\nIn 2017, Segel and Miller released a new book, *Otherworld*, the first of a new young adult series. A second book in the series, *OtherEarth*, was released in 2018, and a third novel, *OtherLife*, in 2019. Segel created and starred in the American drama television series *Dispatches from Elsewhere*, which premiered on March 1, 2020, on AMC.\n\n\nIn 2019, Segel starred in *Our Friend* based on Matthew Teague's 2015 essay \"The Friend\".[40]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nSegel is an ordained minister with the Universal Life Church.[41] He performed a wedding ceremony on *The Tonight Show* on July 6, 2010, for a couple that solicited his services by placing pictures of him around his hometown and the bar he frequently visited.[42]\n\n\nSegel dated his *Freaks and Geeks* co-star Linda Cardellini for several years following the show's cancellation.[43] He dated Michelle Williams from 2012 to 2013.[44] From December 2013 to April 2021, Segel dated photographer Alexis Mixter.[45][46]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Segel, Neil Patrick Harris and Joss Whedon in 2011\n### Film[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1998\n | *Can't Hardly Wait* | Matt\n |  |\n| 1998\n | *Dead Man on Campus* | Kyle\n |  |\n| 1998\n | *SLC Punk!* | Mike\n |  |\n| 2002\n | *Slackers* | Sam Schechter\n |  |\n| 2003\n | *11:14* | Leon (Paramedic #1)\n |  |\n| 2003\n | *Certainly Not a Fairytale* | Leo\n |  |\n| 2004\n | *LolliLove* | Jason\n |  |\n| 2005\n | *The Good Humor Man* | Smelly Bob\n |  |\n| 2006\n | *Bye Bye Benjamin* | Theodore Everest\n |  |\n| 2006\n | *Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny* | Frat Boy\n | Deleted scenes\n |\n| 2007\n | *Knocked Up* | Jason\n |  |\n| 2008\n | *Forgetting Sarah Marshall* | Peter Bretter\n | Also writer |\n| 2009\n | *I Love You, Man* | Sydney Fife\n |  |\n| 2010\n | *Despicable Me* | Victor \"Vector\" Perkins (voice)\n |  |\n| 2010\n | *Gulliver's Travels* | Horatio\n |  |\n| 2011\n | *Bad Teacher* | Russell Gettis\n |  |\n| 2011\n | *Friends with Benefits* | Brice\n | Uncredited cameo\n |\n| 2011\n | *Jeff, Who Lives at Home* | Jeff Thompkins\n |  |\n| 2011\n | *The Muppets* | Gary\n | Also writer and executive producer |\n| 2012\n | *The Five-Year Engagement* | Tom Solomon\n | Also writer and executive producer\n |\n| 2012\n | *This Is 40* | Jason\n |  |\n| 2013\n | *This Is the End* | Himself\n | Uncredited cameo\n |\n| 2014\n | *Sex Tape* | Jay Hargrove\n | Also writer and executive producer\n |\n| 2015\n | *The End of the Tour* | David Foster Wallace |  |\n| 2017\n | *The Discovery* | Will Harbor\n |  |\n| 2018\n | *Come Sunday* | Henry\n |  |\n| 2019\n | *Our Friend*[47] | Dane Faucheux\n |  |\n| 2022\n | *The Sky Is Everywhere*[48] | Big Walker\n |  |\n| 2022\n | *Windfall*[49] | Nobody\n | Also story writer and producer\n |\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1999\u20132000\n | *Freaks and Geeks* | Nick Andopolis | Main role;

'Oh no, I have to actually perform. I have to do well, and I have to have a voice... and I have to have thoughts now.'\"[7]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 2002\u20132016: Early roles and breakthrough[edit]\n\n\n![A brunette woman smiles](image)Smulders at a CBS event in 2008\nSmulders made her professional acting debut in 2002, with guest appearances in the UPN science fiction comedy series *Special Unit 2* and the Showtime science fiction drama series *Jeremiah*.
