Eight national parks (including six in Alaska) are paired with a national preserve, areas with different levels of protection that are administered together but considered separate units and whose areas are not included in the figures below. The 429 units of the National Park System can be broadly referred to as national parks, but most have other formal designations.[4]\n\n\nA bill creating the first national park, Yellowstone, was signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant in 1872, followed by Mackinac National Park in 1875 (decommissioned in 1895), and then Rock Creek Park (later merged into National Capital Parks), Sequoia and Yosemite in 1890. The Organic Act of 1916 created the National Park Service \"to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and wildlife therein, and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.\"[5] Many current national parks had been previously protected as national monuments by the president under the Antiquities Act or as other designations created by Congress before being redesignated by Congress; the newest national park is New River Gorge, previously a National River, and the most recent entirely new park is National Park of American Samoa. A few former national parks are no longer designated as such, or have been disbanded. Fourteen national parks are designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites (WHS),[6] and 21 national parks are named UNESCO Biosphere Reserves (BR),[7] with eight national parks in both programs.\n\n\nThirty states have national parks, as do the territories of American Samoa and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The state with the most national parks is California with nine, followed by Alaska with eight, Utah with five, and Colorado with four. The largest national park is Wrangell–St. Elias in Alaska: at over 8 million acres (32,375 km2), it is larger than each of the nine smallest states. The next three largest parks are also in Alaska. The smallest park is Gateway Arch National Park, Missouri, at 192.83 acres (0.7804 km2). The total area protected by national parks is approximately 52.4 million acres (212,000 km2), for an average of 833 thousand acres (3,370 km2) but a median of only 220 thousand acres (890 km2).[8]\n\n\nThe national parks set a visitation record in 2021, with more than 92 million visitors.[9] Great Smoky Mountains National Park in North Carolina and Tennessee has been the most-visited park since 1944,[10] and had almost 13 million visitors in 2022.[11] In contrast, only about 9,500 people visited the remote Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve in Alaska in 2022.[11]\n\n\n\n\n## National parks[edit]\n\n\n\n**Map all coordinates using** OpenStreetMap\n**Download coordinates as:**\n\n\n\n* KML\n* GPX (all coordinates)\n* GPX (primary coordinates)\n* GPX (secondary coordinates)\n\nLegend\n\\* Green – UNESCO designated World Heritage Sites (WHS)\n\n† Blue – UNESCO designated Biosphere Reserves (BR)\n\n‡ Purple – parks designated in both UNESCO programs\n\n\n\nList of U.S. national parks\n| Name\n | Image\n | Location\n | Date established as park[12] | Area (2023)[8] | Recreation visitors (2022)[11] | Description\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Acadia | ![A white lighthouse](image) | Maine44°21′N 68°13′W﻿ / ﻿44.35°N 68.21°W﻿ / 44.35; -68.21﻿ (Acadia) | February 26, 1919 | 49,071.40 acres (198.6 km2)\n | 3,970,260\n | Covering most of Mount Desert Island and other coastal islands, Acadia features the tallest mountain on the Atlantic coast of the United States, granite peaks, ocean shoreline, woodlands, and lakes.

Eight national parks (including six in Alaska) are paired with a national preserve, areas with different levels of protection that are administered together but considered separate units and whose areas are not included in the figures below. The 429 units of the National Park System can be broadly referred to as national parks, but most have other formal designations.[4]\n\n\nA bill creating the first national park, Yellowstone, was signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant in 1872, followed by Mackinac National Park in 1875 (decommissioned in 1895), and then Rock Creek Park (later merged into National Capital Parks), Sequoia and Yosemite in 1890. The Organic Act of 1916 created the National Park Service \"to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and wildlife therein, and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.\"[5] Many current national parks had been previously protected as national monuments by the president under the Antiquities Act or as other designations created by Congress before being redesignated by Congress; the newest national park is New River Gorge, previously a National River, and the most recent entirely new park is National Park of American Samoa. A few former national parks are no longer designated as such, or have been disbanded. Fourteen national parks are designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites (WHS),[6] and 21 national parks are named UNESCO Biosphere Reserves (BR),[7] with eight national parks in both programs.\n\n\nThirty states have national parks, as do the territories of American Samoa and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The state with the most national parks is California with nine, followed by Alaska with eight, Utah with five, and Colorado with four. The largest national park is Wrangell–St. Elias in Alaska: at over 8 million acres (32,375 km2), it is larger than each of the nine smallest states. The next three largest parks are also in Alaska. The smallest park is Gateway Arch National Park, Missouri, at 192.83 acres (0.7804 km2). The total area protected by national parks is approximately 52.4 million acres (212,000 km2), for an average of 833 thousand acres (3,370 km2) but a median of only 220 thousand acres (890 km2).[8]\n\n\nThe national parks set a visitation record in 2021, with more than 92 million visitors.[9] Great Smoky Mountains National Park in North Carolina and Tennessee has been the most-visited park since 1944,[10] and had almost 13 million visitors in 2022.[11] In contrast, only about 9,500 people visited the remote Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve in Alaska in 2022.[11]\n\n\n\n\n## National parks[edit]\n\n\n\n**Map all coordinates using** OpenStreetMap\n**Download coordinates as:**\n\n\n\n* KML\n* GPX (all coordinates)\n* GPX (primary coordinates)\n* GPX (secondary coordinates)\n\nLegend\n\\* Green – UNESCO designated World Heritage Sites (WHS)\n\n† Blue – UNESCO designated Biosphere Reserves (BR)\n\n‡ Purple – parks designated in both UNESCO programs\n\n\n\nList of U.S. national parks\n| Name\n | Image\n | Location\n | Date established as park[12] | Area (2023)[8] | Recreation visitors (2022)[11] | Description\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Acadia | ![A white lighthouse](image) | Maine44°21′N 68°13′W﻿ / ﻿44.35°N 68.21°W﻿ / 44.35; -68.21﻿ (Acadia) | February 26, 1919 | 49,071.40 acres (198.6 km2)\n | 3,970,260\n | Covering most of Mount Desert Island and other coastal islands, Acadia features the tallest mountain on the Atlantic coast of the United States, granite peaks, ocean shoreline, woodlands, and lakes.

The park straddles the ridgeline of the Great Smoky Mountains, part of the Blue Ridge Mountains, which are a division of the larger Appalachian Mountain chain. The park contains some of the highest mountains in eastern North America, including Clingmans Dome, Mount Guyot, and Mount Le Conte. The border between the two states runs northeast to southwest through the center of the park. The Appalachian Trail passes through the center of the park on its route from Georgia to Maine. With 14.1 million visitors in 2021, the Great Smoky Mountains National Park is the most visited national park in the United States.[6]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n\nMap Highlighting the Park's Boundaries\n\nThe park encompasses 522,419 acres (816.28 sq mi; 211,415.47 ha; 2,114.15 km2), making it one of the largest protected areas in the eastern United States.[3] The main park entrances are located along U.S. Highway 441 (Newfound Gap Road) in the towns of Gatlinburg, Tennessee and Cherokee, North Carolina, and also in Townsend, Tennessee. The park is internationally recognized for its mountains, waterfalls, biodiversity, and forests.[7] In addition, the park preserves multiple historical structures that were part of communities occupied by early European-American settlers of the area.[8]\n\n\nThe park was chartered by the United States Congress in 1934, and officially dedicated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940. The Great Smoky Mountains was the first national park having land and other costs paid in part with federal funds; previous parks were funded wholly with state money or private funds.[9] The park was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983, and an International Biosphere Reserve in 1988.[10]\n\n\nAs the most visited national park in the United States, the Great Smoky Mountains National Park anchors a large tourism industry based in Sevier County, Tennessee adjacent to the park. Major attractions include Dollywood, the second-most visited tourist attraction in Tennessee, Ober Gatlinburg, and Ripley's Aquarium of the Smokies. Tourism to the park contributes an estimated $2.5 billion annually into the local economy.[11]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFor thousands of years, this region was occupied by successive cultures of indigenous peoples. The historic Cherokee had their homeland here, and occupied numerous towns in the river valleys on both sides of the Appalachian Mountains. Their first encounters with Europeans were as traders, mostly coming from the colonial Carolinas and Virginia.\n\n\nEuropean Americans did not begin to settle here until the late 18th and early 19th centuries.[12] Particularly because of their pressure to acquire land in the Deep South, in 1830 President Andrew Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act, beginning the process that eventually resulted in the forced removal of all Indian tribes east of the Mississippi River to Indian Territory (now Oklahoma).\n\n\nMost of the Cherokee were also removed. For a period some, led by such warriors as Tsali, evaded removal by staying in the area now part of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. A band on the Oconaluftee River acquired land and also remained. Their descendants make up most of the federally recognized Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, based in Cherokee, North Carolina, and their Qualla Boundary reserve to the south of the park.\n\n\n\n![](image)Clearcut logging in the Blue Ridge Mountains in Tennessee, 1936\nJohn Mingus, who built the Mingus Mill, and Ralph Hughes settled on the Oconaluftee in 1795. Other settlers soon followed and began clearing land and farming. In 1818, John Oliver and his family were the first white settlers to move into Cades Cove. After 1821, more families settled in Cades Cove including the Jobes, Gregorys, Sparkes, and Cables. As the community began to grow, the Cades Cove Baptist Church was established in 1827.[13]\n\n\nAs white settlers arrived, entrepreneurs developed logging as a major industry in the mountains. The Little River Railroad was constructed by Colonel W. B. Townsend[13] in the late-19th century to haul timber out of the remote regions of the area. Colonel Townsend had purchased 86,000 acres of land on the Little River. The construction of the Little River Railroad set an example for larger companies like the Ritter Lumber Company, Montvale Timber Company, and Norwood Lumber to also purchase acres of land for logging. The logging company Champion purchased 92,000 acres (37,000 ha) of land which included the Greenbrier Cove area and areas from Clingman's Dome to Mount Kephart. By 1909 logging was at its peak and by 1920 about two-thirds of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park area had been logged or burned by fires from logging operations.[13]\n\n\nBecause cut-and-run-style clearcutting was destroying the natural beauty of the area, by the 20th century visitors and locals banded together to raise money for preservation of the land. The U.S. National Park Service wanted a park in the eastern United States, but did not have much money to establish one. David C. Chapman; a Knoxville, Tennessee, business leader; was appointed in 1925 to head a commission to establish a national park here. Congress authorized the park in 1926, but there was no nucleus of federally owned land around which to develop it. John D. Rockefeller Jr. contributed $5 million, the U.S. government added $2 million, and private citizens from Tennessee and North Carolina pitched in to assemble the land for the park, piece by piece.\n\n\nSlowly, mountain homesteaders, miners, and loggers were evicted from the land. Farms and timbering operations were abolished to establish the protected areas of the park. Travel writer Horace Kephart, for whom Mount Kephart was named, and photographers Jim Thompson and George Masa were instrumental in fostering the development of the park.[9][14] Ben W. Hooper, a former governor of Tennessee, was the principal land purchasing agent for the park,[15] which was officially established on June 15, 1934. During the Great Depression, the Civilian Conservation Corps, the Works Progress Administration, and other federal organizations hired workers to build trails, fire watchtowers, and other infrastructure improvements to the park and Smoky Mountains.\n\n\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\nThe majority of rocks in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park are Late Precambrian rocks that are part of the Ocoee Supergroup. This group consists of metamorphosed sandstones, phyllites, schists, and slate. Early Precambrian rocks are not only the oldest rocks in the park but also the dominant rock type in sites such as the Raven Fork Valley and upper Tuckasegee River between Cherokee and Bryson City. They primarily consist of metamorphic gneiss, granite, and schist. Cambrian sedimentary rocks can be found among the bottom of the Foothills to the northwest, and in limestone coves such as Cades Cove.[16] One of the most visited attractions in the mountains is Cades Cove, which is a window or an area where older rocks made out of sandstone surround the valley floor of younger rocks made out of limestone.\n\n\nThe oldest rocks in the Smokies are the Precambrian gneiss and schists which were formed over a billion years ago from the accumulation of marine sediments and igneous rock. In the Late Precambrian, the primordial ocean expanded and the more recent Ocoee Supergroup rocks formed from the accumulation of eroding land mass onto the continental shelf. In the Paleozoic Era, the ocean deposited a thick layer of marine sediments which left behind sedimentary rock. During the Ordovician Period, the collision of the North American and African tectonic plates initiated the Alleghenian orogeny that created the Appalachian range. During the Mesozoic Era rapid erosion of softer sedimentary rocks re-exposed the older Ocoee Supergroup formations.[17]\n\n\n\n## Environment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The observation tower at Clingmans Dome, the highest point in the national park\nElevations in the park range from about 875 feet (267 m) to 6,643 feet (2,025 m) at the summit of Clingmans Dome. Within the park a total of sixteen mountains reach higher than 5,000 feet (1,520 m).[18]\n\n\nThe wide range of elevations mimics the latitudinal changes found throughout the entire eastern United States. Ascending the mountains is comparable to a trip from Tennessee to Canada. Plants and animals common in the country's Northeast have found suitable ecological niches in the park's higher elevations, while southern species find homes in the balmier lower reaches.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the Köppen climate classification system, Great Smoky Mountains National Park has two climate types: humid subtropical (Cfa), and temperate oceanic (Cfb).[*citation needed*] The plant hardiness zone at Clingmans Dome Visitor Center is 5b with an average annual extreme minimum temperature of −14.3 °F (−25.7 °C).[19]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Clingmans Dome Visitor Center, North Carolina (1981–2010 averages).

Annual precipitation amounts range from 50–80 in (1,300–2,000 mm),[22] with heavy winter snowfall in the higher elevations.[23] Flash flooding often occurs after heavy rain.[22]\n\n\nThe average temperature difference between the mountains, such as Newfound Gap at 5,048 ft (1,539 m) above MSL, and the valleys at about 1,600 ft (488 m), is between 10–13 °F (5.6–7.2 °C) for highs, and between 3–6 °F (1.7–3.3 °C) for lows. The difference between high temperatures is similar to the moist adiabatic lapse rate of 3.3 °F (1.8 °C) per 1,000 ft (300 m), while the smaller difference between low temperatures is the result of frequent temperature inversions developing in the morning, most often in autumn.[24]\n\n\nStrong damaging winds of 80–100 mph (130–160 km/h) or higher occur a few times each year around the Smoky Mountains, mainly during the cool season from October to April, as a result of a phenomenon known as mountain waves.[25] Mountain waves are strongest in a narrow area along the foothills, and can create extensive areas of fallen trees and roof damage, especially around Cades Cove and Cove Mountain.[26] Strong winds created by mountain waves were a contributing factor in the devastating Gatlinburg fire on November 28, 2016, during the 2016 Great Smoky Mountains wildfires.[27] Damaging winds can also be generated by strong thunderstorms, with tornadoes and strong thunderstorm complexes (also known as mesoscale convective systems) occasionally affecting the Smoky Mountains.[28]\n\n\n\n### Air pollution[edit]\n\n\nThe park is affected by air pollution because of increased development. In a 2004 report by the National Parks Conservation Association, Great Smoky Mountains National Park was considered the most polluted national park. From 1999 to 2003, the park recorded approximately 150 unhealthy air days, the equivalent of about one month of unhealthy air days per year.[29][30] In 2013, Colorado State University reported that, due to the passing of the United States Clean Air Act in 1970, and the subsequent implementation of the Acid Rain Program, there had been a \"significant improvement\" to the air quality in the Great Smoky Mountains from 1990 to 2010.[31][32]\n\n\n\n## Biology and ecology[edit]\n\n\nThe park is almost 95 percent forested, and almost 36 percent of it, 187,000 acres (76,000 ha), is estimated by the Park Service to be old growth forest with many trees that predate European settlement of the area.[33] It is one of the largest blocks of deciduous, temperate, old growth forest in North America.\n\n\n\n![](image)Colorful autumn leaves in October 2008\nThe variety of elevations, the abundant rainfall, and the presence of old growth forests give the park an unusual richness of biota. About 19,000 species of organisms are known to live in the park, and estimates as high as an additional 100,000 undocumented species may also be present.\n\n\nPark officials count more than 200 species of birds, 50 species of fish, 39 species of reptiles, and 43 species of amphibians, including many lungless salamanders. The park is an important site for salamanders.[34] The park has a noteworthy black bear population, numbering about 1,500.[35] An attempt to reintroduce red wolves into the park in 1991 failed drastically, forcing the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services to remove the wolves from the area in 1998. Elk (wapiti) were reintroduced to the park in 2001, three years after the FWS removed the red wolves from the area. Elk are most abundant in the Cataloochee area in the southeastern section of the park.[36]\n\n\nIt is also home to species of mammals such as the raccoon, bobcat, two species of fox, river otter, woodchuck, beaver, two species of squirrel, opossum, coyote, white-tailed deer, chipmunk, two species of skunk, and various species of bats.\n\n\nOver 100 species of trees grow in the park. The lower region forests are dominated by deciduous leafy trees. At higher altitudes, deciduous forests give way to coniferous trees like Fraser fir. In addition, the park has over 1,400 flowering plant species and over 4,000 species of non-flowering plants.\n\n\n\n### Fish[edit]\n\n\nThere have been hundreds of known species of fish living in the area.\n\n\n\n#### List of fish[edit]\n\n\nSource:[37]\n\n\n\n* American gizzard shad\n* Lamoetra appendix\n* Longnose gar\n* Mountain brook lamprey\n* Brook trout\n\n\n## Attractions and activities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Alum Cave Trail to the summit of Mount LeConte provides numerous views of the Great Smoky Mountains.\nThe Great Smoky Mountains National Park is a major tourist attraction in the region. It has been the most visited national park for many years, with over 14.1 million recreational visitors (tourists) in 2021.[38] The recreational figure represents nearly twice as many tourists as the Grand Canyon, which received nearly 6 million visitors the same year. Surrounding towns, notably Gatlinburg, Pigeon Forge, Sevierville, and Townsend, Tennessee, and Cherokee, Sylva, Maggie Valley, and Bryson City, North Carolina, receive a significant portion of their income from tourism associated with the park.\n\n\nThe two main visitor centers inside the park are Sugarlands Visitors' Center near the Gatlinburg entrance to the park and Oconaluftee Visitor Center near Cherokee, North Carolina, at the eastern entrance to the park. These ranger stations provide exhibits on wildlife, geology, and the history of the park. They also sell books, maps, and souvenirs. Entrance into the park is free.[39]\n\n\nU.S. Highway 441 (known in the park as Newfound Gap Road) bisects the park, providing automobile access to many trailheads and overlooks, most notably that of Newfound Gap. At an elevation of 5,048 feet (1,539 m), it is the lowest gap in the mountains and is situated near the center of the park, on the Tennessee/North Carolina state line, halfway between the border towns of Gatlinburg and Cherokee. It was here that in 1940, from the Rockefeller Memorial, Franklin Delano Roosevelt dedicated the national park. On clear days Newfound Gap offers arguably the most spectacular scenes accessible via highway in the park.\n\n\nLakeview Drive, located along the north shore of Fontana Lake, is a scenic road that was never completed. Split in two segments, it is accessible via either Fontana Dam or Bryson City. It features an unused road tunnel and connects to various hiking and horse-back riding trails in the area.\n\n\nThe park has a number of historical attractions. The most well-preserved of these (and most popular) is Cades Cove, a valley with a number of preserved historic buildings including log cabins, barns, and churches. Cades Cove is the single most frequented destination in the national park. Self-guided automobile and bicycle tours offer the many sightseers a glimpse into the way of life of old-time southern Appalachia. Other historical areas within the park include Roaring Fork, Cataloochee, Elkmont, and the Mountain Farm Museum and Mingus Mill on the Oconaluftee River.\n\n\n\n### Hiking[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hiking in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park\n\nThere are 850 miles (1,370 km) of trails and unpaved roads in the park for hiking, including 70 miles (110 km) of the Appalachian Trail.[40] Mount Le Conte is one of the most frequented destinations in the park. Its elevation is 6,593 feet (2,010 m), the third highest summit in the park and, measured from its base to its highest peak, the tallest mountain east of the Mississippi River. Alum Cave Trail is the most heavily used of the five paths en route to the summit. It provides many scenic overlooks and unique natural attractions such as Alum Cave Bluffs and Arch Rock. Hikers may spend a night at the LeConte Lodge, located near the summit, which provides cabins and rooms for rent (except during the winter season). Accessible solely by trail, it is the only private lodging available inside the park.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Chimney Tops was a popular destination for hikers until access was closed due to damage from the 2016 Great Smoky Mountains wildfires.\nAnother popular hiking trail led to the pinnacle of the Chimney Tops, so named because of its unique dual-humped peaktops. This short but strenuous trek rewarded nature enthusiasts with a spectacular panorama of the surrounding mountain peaks. It was the flashpoint for the 2016 Great Smoky Mountains wildfires, and therefore sustained extensive damage, evident still today in clearly visible burn scars. The peak has been closed to tourists ever since.\n\n\nBoth the Laurel Falls and Clingmans Dome trails offer relatively easy, short, paved paths to their respective destinations. The Laurel Falls Trail leads to a powerful 80-foot (24 m) waterfall, and the Clingmans Dome Trail takes visitors on an uphill climb to a 50 feet (15 m) tall observation deck, which on a clear day offers views for many miles over the Tennessee, North Carolina, and Georgia mountains.\n\n\nIn addition to day hiking, the national park offers opportunities for backpacking and camping. Camping is allowed only in designated camping areas and shelters. Most of the park's trail shelters are located along the Appalachian Trail or a short distance away on side trails. In addition to the Appalachian Trail shelters used mostly for extended backpacking trips there are three shelters in the park that are not located on the Appalachian Trail. The Mt. LeConte Shelter is located a short distance east of LeConte Lodge on The Boulevard Trail. It can accommodate 12 people per night, and is the only backcountry site in the entire park that has a permanent ban on campfires. The Kephart Shelter is located at the terminus of the Kephart Prong Trail which begins upstream of the Collins Creek Picnic Area. The shelter, situated along a tributary of the Oconaluftee River can accommodate 14 people. Laurel Gap Shelter is one of the more remote shelters in the park. Situated in a Beech forest swag between Balsam High Top and Big Cataloochee Mountain, the Laurel Gap Shelter can accommodate up to 14 people per night. This shelter is a popular base camp for peakbaggers exploring the heart of the Smokies wilderness.\n\n\nDesignated backcountry campsites are scattered throughout the park. A permit, available at ranger stations and via the park website, is required for all backcountry camping. Additionally, reservations are required for all of the shelters and backcountry campsites. A maximum stay of one night, in the case of shelters, or three nights, in the case of campsites, may limit the traveler's itinerary.\n\n\n\n### Other activities[edit]\n\n\nAfter hiking and simple sightseeing, fishing (especially fly fishing) is the most popular activity in the national park. The park's waters have long had a reputation for healthy trout activity as well as challenging fishing terrain. Brook trout are native to the waters, while both brown and rainbow were introduced to the area. Partially due to the fact of recent droughts killing off the native fish, there are strict regulations regarding how fishing may be conducted. Horseback riding (offered by the national park and on limited trails), bicycling (available for rent in Cades Cove) and water tubing are all also practiced within the park.\n\n\nFrom late May to early June, the Elkmont area of the park hosts the peak display period for synchronous fireflies (*Photinus carolinus*), one of at least 19 species of fireflies that live in Great Smoky Mountains National Park.[41] They are the only species in America whose individuals can synchronize their flashing light patterns.[42]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cades Cove panorama\n## Historic areas within the national park[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of historical structures maintained by the Great Smoky Mountains National Park\n\n![](image)The Becky Cable house in the Cades Cove Historic District was built in 1879.\nThe park service maintains four historic districts and one archaeological district within park boundaries, as well as nine individual listings on the National Register of Historic Places. Notable structures not listed include the Mountain Farm Museum buildings at Oconaluftee and buildings in the Cataloochee area. The Mingus Mill (in Oconaluftee) and Smoky Mountain Hiking Club cabin in Greenbrier have been deemed eligible for listing.\n\n\n\n### Historic districts[edit]\n\n\n* Cades Cove Historic District\n* Elkmont Historic District\n* Oconaluftee Archaeological District\n* Noah Ogle Place\n* Roaring Fork Historic District\n\n\n### Individual listings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The John Ownby Cabin in The Sugarlands valley was built in 1860.\n* Alex Cole Cabin\n* Clingmans Dome Observation Tower\n* Hall Cabin (in Hazel Creek area)\n* John Messer Barn\n* John Ownby Cabin\n* Oconaluftee Baptist Church (also called Smokemont Baptist Church)\n* Tyson McCarter Place\n* Mayna Treanor Avent Studio\n* Little Greenbrier School\n* Walker Sisters Place\n\n\n## Cultural importance[edit]\n\n\nThe park was used for filming scenes of Disney's hit 1950s TV series *Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier*.\n\n\nThis park was designated an International Biosphere Reserve in 1976, was certified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983, and became a part of the Southern Appalachian Biosphere Reserve in 1988.[43]\n\n\nA 75th anniversary re-dedication ceremony was held on 2 September 2009. Among those in attendance were the four U.S. senators from Tennessee and North Carolina, the three US Representatives whose districts include the park, the governors of both states, and Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar. Dolly Parton, Tennessee native, singer, and actress also attended and performed.[44]\n\n\nIn late November and early December 2016, a series of wildfires engulfed a total of 17,900 acres (72 km2) in the park and surrounding areas. The wildfires killed at least 14, injured 190, and forced the evacuation of more than 14,000 people.[45] The fires also damaged or destroyed at least 2,000 structures. The fires, which were initially suspected to have been caused by arson, occurred during a period of unusual drought, which accelerated the fires. The wildfires were the deadliest in the Eastern United States since the Great Fires of 1947, and comprised one of the worst natural disasters in the history of Tennessee.[46][47][48][49]\n\n\nIn 2015 Cassius Cash was appointed as the first African-American superintendent of Great Smoky Mountains National Park. He is the 16th superintendent of the park.[50]\n\n\nIn 2023, the national park will be featured on a USPS Priority Mail Express stamp depicting a scene near the Newfound Gap. The stamp was designed by USPS art director Greg Breeding, with art from Dan Cosgrove.[51]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Great Smoky Mountains Association\n* Great Smoky Mountains Heritage Center\n* Wildflowers of the Great Smoky Mountains\n* List of birds of Great Smoky Mountains National Park\n* List of national parks of the United States\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Great Smoky Mountains in United States of America Archived 24 July 2019 at the Wayback Machine. *protectedplanet.net*.

The park's central feature is the Grand Canyon, a gorge of the Colorado River, which is often considered one of the Wonders of the World. The park, which covers 1,217,262 acres (1,901.972 sq mi; 4,926.08 km2) of unincorporated area in Coconino and Mohave counties, received more than 4.7 million recreational visitors in 2022, which is the second highest count of all American national parks after Great Smoky Mountains National Park.[5] The Grand Canyon was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1979. The park celebrated its 100th anniversary on February 26, 2019.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)1938 poster of the park\nThe Grand Canyon became well known to Americans in the 1880s after railroads were built and pioneers developed infrastructure and early tourism.[7] In 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt visited the site and said, \n\n\n> The Grand Canyon fills me with awe. It is beyond comparison—beyond description; absolutely unparalleled through-out the wide world ... Let this great wonder of nature remain as it now is. Do nothing to mar its grandeur, sublimity and loveliness. You cannot improve on it. But you can keep it for your children, your children's children, and all who come after you, as the one great sight which every American should see.[8]\n> \n> \n\n\nDespite Roosevelt's enthusiasm and strong interest in preserving land for public use, the Grand Canyon was not immediately designated as a national park. The first bill to establish Grand Canyon National Park was introduced in 1882 by then-Senator Benjamin Harrison, which would have established Grand Canyon as the third national park in the United States, after Yellowstone and Mackinac. Harrison unsuccessfully reintroduced his bill in 1883 and 1886; after his election to the presidency, he established the Grand Canyon Forest Reserve in 1893. Theodore Roosevelt created the Grand Canyon Game Preserve by proclamation on November 28, 1906,[9] and the Grand Canyon National Monument on January 11, 1908.[10] Further Senate bills to establish the site as a national park were introduced and defeated in 1910 and 1911, before the Grand Canyon National Park Act (Pub. L.Tooltip Public Law (United States) 65–277) was finally signed by President Woodrow Wilson on February 26, 1919.[11] The National Park Service, established in 1916, assumed administration of the park.\n\n\nThe creation of the park was an early success of the conservation movement. Its national park status may have helped thwart proposals to dam the Colorado River within its boundaries. (Later, the Glen Canyon Dam would be built upriver.) A second Grand Canyon National Monument to the west was proclaimed in 1932.[12] In 1975, that monument and Marble Canyon National Monument, which was established in 1969 and followed the Colorado River northeast from the Grand Canyon to Lees Ferry, were made part of Grand Canyon National Park. In 1979, UNESCO declared the park a World Heritage Site. The 1987 the National Parks Overflights Act[13] found that\n\"Noise associated with aircraft overflights at the Grand Canyon National Park is causing a significant adverse effect on the natural quiet and experience of the park and current aircraft operations at the Grand Canyon National Park have raised serious concerns regarding public safety, including concerns regarding the safety of park users.\"\n\n\n\n![](image)Grand Canyon Quarter\nIn 2010, Grand Canyon National Park was honored with its own coin under the America the Beautiful Quarters program.[14] On February 26, 2019, the Grand Canyon National Park commemorated 100 years since its designation as a national park.[15]\n\n\nThe Grand Canyon had been part of the National Park Service's Intermountain Region until 2018.[*citation needed*] Today, the Grand Canyon is a part of Region 8, also known as the Lower Colorado Basin.[16]\n\n\n\n### Legal history timeline[edit]\n\n\n* **1882** First unsuccessful attempt to establish a Grand Canyon National Park\n* **1893** Designated a \"forest reserve\" by President Benjamin Harrison (Presidential Proclamation #45)\n* **1908** Established as Grand Canyon National Monument by President Theodore Roosevelt (Presidential Proclamation #794)\n* **1919** Designation of Grand Canyon National Park by an act of Congress on February 26 (40 Stat 1175)\n* **1975** Grand Canyon National Park Enlargement Act an act of Congress on January 3 (88 Stat 2089) (Pub.

The canyon itself was created by the incision of the Colorado River and its tributaries after the Colorado Plateau was uplifted, causing the Colorado River system to develop along its present path.\n\n\nThe primary public areas of the park are the South and North Rims, and adjacent areas of the canyon itself. The rest of the park is extremely rugged and remote, although many places are accessible by pack trail and backcountry roads. The South Rim is more accessible than the North Rim and accounts for 90% of park visitation.[19]\n\n\nThe park headquarters are at Grand Canyon Village, not far from the South Entrance to the park, near one of the most popular viewpoints.\n\n\n\n### South Rim[edit]\n\n\n![](image)From Powell Point on the South Rim\nMost visitors to the park come to the South Rim, arriving on Arizona State Route 64. The highway enters the park through the South Entrance, near Tusayan, Arizona, and heads eastward, leaving the park through the East Entrance.[20] Interstate 40 provides access to the area from the south. From the north, U.S. Route 89 connects Utah, Colorado, and the North Rim to the South Rim.[21] Overall, some 30 miles of the South Rim are accessible by road.[22][*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n#### Services[edit]\n\n\nGrand Canyon Village is the primary visitor services area in the park. It is a full-service community, including lodging, fuel, food, souvenirs, a hospital, churches, and access to trails and guided walks and talks.[23]\n\n\n\n#### Lodging[edit]\n\n\nSeveral lodging facilities are available along the South Rim.[24] Hotels and other lodging include El Tovar, Bright Angel Lodge, Kachina Lodge, Thunderbird Lodge, and Maswik Lodge, all of which are located in Grand Canyon Village, and Phantom Ranch, located on the canyon floor.[24] There is also an RV Park named Trailer Village. All of these facilities are managed by Xanterra Parks & Resorts, while the Yavapai Lodge (also in the village area) is managed by Delaware North.[24]\n\n\n\n### North Rim[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sunset at Cape Royal Point, North Rim. Wotans Throne featured.\nThe North Rim area of the park is located on the Kaibab Plateau and Walhalla Plateau, directly across the Grand Canyon from the principal visitor areas on the South Rim. The North Rim's principal visitor areas are centered around Bright Angel Point. The North Rim is higher in elevation than the South Rim, at over 8,000 feet (2,400 m) of elevation. Because it is so much higher than the South Rim, it is closed from December 1 through May 15 each year, due to the enhanced snowfall at elevation. Visitor services are closed or limited in scope after October 15. Driving time from the South Rim to the North Rim is about 4.5 hours, over 220 miles (350 km).\n[19]\n\n\nOn the North Rim is the historic Grand Canyon Lodge,[24] managed by Forever Resorts, and a campground near the lodge managed by the national park staff.[25]\n\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the Köppen climate classification system, Grand Canyon National Park has five climate zones; Cold Semi-Arid (*BSk*), Humid Continental Dry Cool Summer (*Dsb*), Humid Continental Dry Warm Summer (*Dsa*), Warm Summer Mediterranean (*Csb*), and Hot Summer Mediterranean (*Csa*). The plant hardiness zone at Grand Canyon Visitor Center is 7a with an average annual extreme minimum temperature of 3.3 °F (−15.9 °C).[26]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Grand Canyon NP 2, Arizona, 1991–2020 normals, extremes 1976–2012\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °F (°C)\n | 64(18)\n | 69(21)\n | 77(25)\n | 82(28)\n | 92(33)\n | 101(38)\n | 97(36)\n | 97(36)\n | 93(34)\n | 89(32)\n | 74(23)\n | 65(18)\n | 101(38)\n |\n| Mean maximum °F (°C)\n | 57.1(13.9)\n | 59.4(15.2)\n | 65.9(18.8)\n | 74.4(23.6)\n | 83.0(28.3)\n | 90.9(32.7)\n | 94.0(34.4)\n | 90.1(32.3)\n | 85.3(29.6)\n | 76.1(24.5)\n | 65.9(18.8)\n | 58.2(14.6)\n | 94.0(34.4)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °F (°C)\n | 44.3(6.8)\n | 46.3(7.9)\n | 53.6(12.0)\n | 60.9(16.1)\n | 69.9(21.1)\n | 82.0(27.8)\n | 84.9(29.4)\n | 82.1(27.8)\n | 75.8(24.3)\n | 64.6(18.1)\n | 53.2(11.8)\n | 43.0(6.1)\n | 63.4(17.4)\n |\n| Daily mean °F (°C)\n | 31.7(−0.2)\n | 33.7(0.9)\n | 39.3(4.1)\n | 44.9(7.2)\n | 52.8(11.6)\n | 62.5(16.9)\n | 67.7(19.8)\n | 65.9(18.8)\n | 59.8(15.4)\n | 49.0(9.4)\n | 39.0(3.9)\n | 30.6(−0.8)\n | 48.1(8.9)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °F (°C)\n | 19.2(−7.1)\n | 21.1(−6.1)\n | 25.0(−3.9)\n | 28.8(−1.8)\n | 35.6(2.0)\n | 43.0(6.1)\n | 50.4(10.2)\n | 49.8(9.9)\n | 43.7(6.5)\n | 33.3(0.7)\n | 24.7(−4.1)\n | 18.2(−7.7)\n | 32.7(0.4)\n |\n| Mean minimum °F (°C)\n | 0.0(−17.8)\n | 3.1(−16.1)\n | 10.6(−11.9)\n | 18.2(−7.7)\n | 25.1(−3.8)\n | 31.2(−0.4)\n | 41.0(5.0)\n | 41.6(5.3)\n | 32.7(0.4)\n | 20.8(−6.2)\n | 7.6(−13.6)\n | 1.9(−16.7)\n | −3.6(−19.8)\n |\n| Record low °F (°C)\n | −17(−27)\n | −20(−29)\n | −1(−18)\n | 8(−13)\n | 17(−8)\n | 25(−4)\n | 35(2)\n | 35(2)\n | 24(−4)\n | 8(−13)\n | −6(−21)\n | −20(−29)\n | −20(−29)\n |\n| Average precipitation inches (mm)\n | 1.76(45)\n | 1.23(31)\n | 1.85(47)\n | 0.64(16)\n | 0.40(10)\n | 0.22(5.6)\n | 2.33(59)\n | 2.19(56)\n | 1.50(38)\n | 1.23(31)\n | 0.77(20)\n | 1.25(32)\n | 15.37(390)\n |\n| Average snowfall inches (cm)\n | 12.9(33)\n | 7.8(20)\n | 8.1(21)\n | 2.8(7.1)\n | 0.1(0.25)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 1.1(2.8)\n | 2.2(5.6)\n | 8.0(20)\n | 43.0(109)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.01 in) | 6.4\n | 6.1\n | 5.9\n | 3.5\n | 2.6\n | 1.7\n | 7.0\n | 10.1\n | 5.7\n | 5.1\n | 4.0\n | 6.0\n | 64.1\n |\n| Average snowy days (≥ 0.1 in) | 4.0\n | 3.3\n | 2.9\n | 1.2\n | 0.1\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.7\n | 1.3\n | 3.5\n | 17.0\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 217.0\n | 226.0\n | 279.0\n | 330.0\n | 372.0\n | 390.0\n | 341.0\n | 341.0\n | 300.0\n | 279.0\n | 240.0\n | 217.0\n | 3,532\n |\n| Mean daily sunshine hours | 7\n | 8\n | 9\n | 11\n | 12\n | 13\n | 11\n | 11\n | 10\n | 9\n | 8\n | 7\n | 10\n |\n| Mean daily daylight hours | 10.0\n | 10.9\n | 12.0\n | 13.1\n | 14.1\n | 14.6\n | 14.3\n | 13.5\n | 12.4\n | 11.3\n | 10.3\n | 9.8\n | 12.2\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 70\n | 73\n | 75\n | 84\n | 85\n | 89\n | 77\n | 81\n | 81\n | 80\n | 78\n | 71\n | 79\n |\n| Average ultraviolet index | 3\n | 4\n | 6\n | 8\n | 10\n | 11\n | 11\n | 10\n | 8\n | 5\n | 3\n | 2\n | 7\n |\n| Source 1: NOAA (mean maxima, minima 1981–2010)[27][28] |\n| Source 2: Weather Atlas (sun data)[29] |\n\n## Activities[edit]\n\n\n### North Rim[edit]\n\n\n![](image)From Toroweap Overlook on the North Rim\nThere are few roads on the North Rim, but there are some notable vehicle-accessible lookout points, including Point Imperial, Roosevelt Point, and Cape Royal. Mule rides are also available to a variety of places, including several thousand feet down into the canyon.\n\n\nMany visitors to the North Rim choose to make use of the variety of hiking trails including the Widforss Trail, Uncle Jim's Trail, the Transept Trail, and the North Kaibab Trail. The North Kaibab Trail can be followed all the way down to the Colorado River, connecting across the river to the South Kaibab Trail and the Bright Angel Trail, which continue up to the South Rim of the Grand Canyon.\n\n\nThe Toroweap Overlook is located in the western part of the park on the North Rim. Access is via unpaved roads off Route 389 west of Fredonia, Arizona. The roads lead through Grand Canyon–Parashant National Monument and to the overlook.\n\n\n\n### South Rim[edit]\n\n\n![](image)From Desert View on the South Rim\nA variety of activities at the South Rim cater to park visitors. A driving tour (35 miles (56 km)) along the South Rim is split into two segments. The western drive to Hermit's Point is eight miles (13 km) with several overlooks along the way, including Mohave Point, Hopi Point, and the Powell Memorial.[23] From March to December, access to Hermit's Rest is restricted to the free shuttle provided by the Park Service. The eastern portion to Desert View is 25 miles (40 km), and is open to private vehicles year round.\n\n\nWalking tours include the Rim Trail, which runs west from the Pipe Creek viewpoint for about eight miles (13 km) of paved road, followed by seven miles (11 km) unpaved to Hermit's Rest. Hikes can begin almost anywhere along this trail, and a shuttle can return hikers to their point of origin. Mather Point, the first view most people reach when entering from the south entrance, is a popular place to begin.\n\n\nPrivate canyon flyovers are provided by helicopters and small airplanes out of Las Vegas, Phoenix, and Grand Canyon National Park Airport. Due to a crash in the 1990s, scenic flights are no longer allowed to fly within 1,500 feet (460 m) of the rim within the Grand Canyon National Park.[30] Flights within the canyon are still available outside of park boundaries.[31]\n\n\n\n## Grand Canyon Conservancy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Grand Canyon Conservancy\n\nThe Grand Canyon Association (GCA) is the National Park Service's official nonprofit partner. It raises private funds to benefit Grand Canyon National Park by operating retail shops and visitor centers within the park, and providing educational opportunities about the natural and cultural history of the region. Its goals include:\n\n\n\n* Creating Inter-tribal cultural sites\n* Dark Sky Preservation\n* Discovery and exploration of the Park\n* Trail creation and preservation[32]\n\n\n![](image)\nA panoramic view from the South Rim\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Arizona portal\n\n\n![](image) Media related to Grand Canyon at Wikimedia Commons (image gallery)\n\n\n\n* List of trails in Grand Canyon National Park\n* List of national parks of the United States\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Grand Canyon in United States of America Archived July 24, 2019, at the Wayback Machine. *protectedplanet.net*.

Located at the junction of the Colorado Plateau, Great Basin, and Mojave Desert regions, the park has a unique geography and a variety of life zones that allow for unusual plant and animal diversity. Numerous plant species as well as 289 species of birds, 75 mammals (including 19 species of bat), and 32 reptiles inhabit the park's four life zones: desert, riparian, woodland, and coniferous forest. Zion National Park includes mountains, canyons, buttes, mesas, monoliths, rivers, slot canyons, and natural arches. The lowest point in the park is 3,666 ft (1,117 m) at Coalpits Wash and the highest peak is 8,726 ft (2,660 m) at Horse Ranch Mountain. A prominent feature of the 229-square-mile (590 km2) park is Zion Canyon, which is 15 miles (24 km) long and up to 2,640 ft (800 m) deep. The canyon walls are reddish and tan-colored Navajo Sandstone eroded by the North Fork of the Virgin River.\n\n\nHuman habitation of the area started about 8,000 years ago with small family groups of Native Americans, one of which was the semi-nomadic Basketmaker Ancestral Puebloans (who used to be called Anasazi by early non-indigenous archeologists[4])(c. 300 CE). Subsequently, what has been called the Virgin Anasazi culture (c. 500) and the Parowan Fremont group developed as the Basketmakers settled in permanent communities.[5] Both groups moved away by 1300 and were replaced by the Parrusits and several other Southern Paiute subtribes. Mormons came into the area in 1858 and settled there in the early 1860s. \n\n\n\n\n## Name change[edit]\n\n\nIn 1909, President William Howard Taft named the area **Mukuntuweap National Monument** in order to protect the canyon.[6] In 1918, the acting director of the newly created National Park Service, Horace Albright, drafted a proposal to enlarge the existing monument and change the park's name to **Zion National Monument**, Zion being a term used by the Mormons.[6] According to historian Hal Rothman: \"The name change played to a prevalent bias of the time. Many believed that Spanish and Indian names would deter visitors who, if they could not pronounce the name of a place, might not bother to visit it.[7] The new name, Zion, had greater appeal to an ethnocentric audience.\"[8] On November 19, 1919, Congress redesignated the monument as **Zion National Park**, and the act was signed by President Woodrow Wilson.[9] The Kolob section was proclaimed a separate Zion National Monument in 1937, but was incorporated into the national park in 1956.[10] Congress designated 85% of the park a wilderness area in 2009.\n\n\nThe geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area includes nine formations that together represent 150 million years of mostly Mesozoic-aged sedimentation. At various periods in that time warm, shallow seas, streams, ponds and lakes, vast deserts, and dry near-shore environments covered the area. Uplift associated with the creation of the Colorado Plateau lifted the region 10,000 feet (3,000 m) starting 13 million years ago.[11]\n\n\n\n## Park purpose[edit]\n\n\nAs stated in the foundation document:[12]\n\n\n\n\n> The purpose of Zion National Park is to preserve the dramatic geology including Zion Canyon and a labyrinth of deep and brilliantly colored Navajo sandstone canyons formed by extraordinary processes of erosion at the margin of the Colorado Plateau; to safeguard the park's wilderness character and its wild and scenic river values; to protect evidence of human history; and to provide for scientific research and the enjoyment and enlightenment of the public.\n> \n> \n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nThe park is located in southwestern Utah in Washington, Iron and Kane counties. Geomorphically, it is located on the Markagunt and Kolob plateaus, at the intersection of three North American geographic provinces: the Colorado Plateau, the Great Basin, and the Mojave Desert. The northern part of the park is known as the **Kolob Canyons** section and is accessible from Interstate 15, exit 40.[13]\n\n\nThe 8,726-foot (2,660 m) summit of Horse Ranch Mountain is the highest point in the park; the lowest point is the 3,666-foot (1,117 m) elevation of Coal Pits Wash, creating a relief of about 5,100 feet (1,600 m).[14]\n\n\nStreams in the area take rectangular paths because they follow jointing planes in the rocks.[15] The stream gradient of the Virgin River, whose North Fork flows through Zion Canyon in the park, ranges from 50 to 80 feet per mile (9.5 to 15.2 m/km) (0.9–1.5%)—one of the steepest stream gradients in North America.[16]\n\n\n\n![](image)Towers of the Virgin: The Sundial (left), The Witch Head, Broken Tooth, Rotten Tooth, Altar of Sacrifice\nThe road into Zion Canyon is 6 miles (9.7 km) long, ending at the Temple of Sinawava, which is named for the coyote god of the Paiute Indians.[17] The canyon becomes more narrow near the Temple and a hiking trail continues to the mouth of The Narrows, a gorge only 20 feet (6 m) wide and up to 2,000 feet (610 m) tall.[18] The Zion Canyon road is served by a free shuttle bus from early April to late October and by private vehicles the other months of the year. Other roads in Zion are open to private vehicles year-round.\n\n\nThe east side of the park is served by Zion-Mount Carmel Highway (SR-9), which passes through the Zion–Mount Carmel Tunnel and ends at US 89 at Mount Carmel Junction. Park features on the east side of the park include Checkerboard Mesa and The East Temple.\n\n\nThe Kolob Terrace area, northwest of Zion Canyon, features a slot canyon called The Subway, and a panoramic view of the entire area from Lava Point. The Kolob Canyons section, further to the northwest near Cedar City, features Tucupit Point and one of the world's longest natural arches, Kolob Arch.[19]\n\n\n\n![](image)Court of the Patriarchs, by Ansel Adams (1933)\nOther notable geographic features of Zion Canyon include Angels Landing, The Great White Throne, the Court of the Patriarchs, The Sentinel, The West Temple, Towers of the Virgin, the Altar of Sacrifice, The Watchman, Weeping Rock, and the Emerald Pools.[20]\n\n\nSpring weather is unpredictable, with stormy, wet days being common, mixed with occasional warm, sunny weather. Precipitation is normally heaviest in March.[21] Spring wildflowers bloom from April through June, peaking in May. Fall days are usually clear and mild; nights are often cool. Summer days are hot (95 to 110 °F; 35 to 43 °C), but overnight lows are usually comfortable (65 to 70 °F; 18 to 21 °C).[21] Afternoon thunderstorms are common from mid-July through mid-September.[21] Storms may produce waterfalls as well as flash floods. Autumn tree-color displays begin in September in the high country; in Zion Canyon, autumn colors usually peak in late October. Winter in Zion Canyon is fairly mild. Winter storms bring rain or light snow to Zion Canyon and heavier snow to the higher elevations. Clear days may become quite warm, reaching 60 °F (16 °C); nights are often 20 to 40 °F (−7 to 4 °C).[21] Winter storms can last several days and make roads icy. Zion roads are plowed, except the Kolob Terrace Road which is closed when covered with snow.[21] Winter driving conditions last from November through March.[21]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nZion National Park has a *BSk* (Köppen climate classification) cold semi-arid climate consisting of very hot summers and mild winters with a limited amount of precipitation throughout the year.\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Zion National Park, Utah, 1991–2020 normals, extremes 1904–present\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °F (°C)\n | 74(23)\n | 97(36)\n | 91(33)\n | 97(36)\n | 106(41)\n | 114(46)\n | 115(46)\n | 112(44)\n | 110(43)\n | 99(37)\n | 90(32)\n | 81(27)\n | 115(46)\n |\n| Mean maximum °F (°C)\n | 66.3(19.1)\n | 70.3(21.3)\n | 79.8(26.6)\n | 87.8(31.0)\n | 97.0(36.1)\n | 105.6(40.9)\n | 109.4(43.0)\n | 106.5(41.4)\n | 101.5(38.6)\n | 91.6(33.1)\n | 78.7(25.9)\n | 65.6(18.7)\n | 110.1(43.4)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °F (°C)\n | 53.8(12.1)\n | 57.6(14.2)\n | 66.1(18.9)\n | 73.1(22.8)\n | 83.5(28.6)\n | 95.3(35.2)\n | 100.3(37.9)\n | 98.0(36.7)\n | 90.7(32.6)\n | 78.1(25.6)\n | 63.9(17.7)\n | 52.5(11.4)\n | 76.1(24.5)\n |\n| Daily mean °F (°C)\n | 42.1(5.6)\n | 45.6(7.6)\n | 52.4(11.3)\n | 58.4(14.7)\n | 68.0(20.0)\n | 78.8(26.0)\n | 84.9(29.4)\n | 83.3(28.5)\n | 76.0(24.4)\n | 63.4(17.4)\n | 50.6(10.3)\n | 40.9(4.9)\n | 62.0(16.7)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °F (°C)\n | 30.4(−0.9)\n | 33.6(0.9)\n | 38.7(3.7)\n | 43.8(6.6)\n | 52.5(11.4)\n | 62.2(16.8)\n | 69.5(20.8)\n | 68.7(20.4)\n | 61.3(16.3)\n | 48.8(9.3)\n | 37.3(2.9)\n | 29.3(−1.5)\n | 48.0(8.9)\n |\n| Mean minimum °F (°C)\n | 14.9(−9.5)\n | 18.9(−7.3)\n | 24.9(−3.9)\n | 29.1(−1.6)\n | 37.1(2.8)\n | 46.6(8.1)\n | 59.8(15.4)\n | 59.7(15.4)\n | 47.8(8.8)\n | 31.4(−0.3)\n | 19.7(−6.8)\n | 13.5(−10.3)\n | 10.7(−11.8)\n |\n| Record low °F (°C)\n | −15(−26)\n | 0(−18)\n | 10(−12)\n | 21(−6)\n | 22(−6)\n | 35(2)\n | 41(5)\n | 37(3)\n | 33(1)\n | 13(−11)\n | 0(−18)\n | −5(−21)\n | −15(−26)\n |\n| Average precipitation inches (mm)\n | 1.99(51)\n | 2.06(52)\n | 2.01(51)\n | 1.22(31)\n | 0.77(20)\n | 0.23(5.8)\n | 1.15(29)\n | 1.63(41)\n | 1.17(30)\n | 1.22(31)\n | 1.18(30)\n | 1.64(42)\n | 16.27(413)\n |\n| Average snowfall inches (cm)\n | 0.7(1.8)\n | 0.8(2.0)\n | 0.7(1.8)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.1(0.25)\n | 1.7(4.3)\n | 4.0(10)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.01 in) | 7.1\n | 7.9\n | 7.4\n | 5.7\n | 4.5\n | 2.0\n | 4.8\n | 6.0\n | 4.4\n | 4.8\n | 4.4\n | 6.5\n | 65.5\n |\n| Average snowy days (≥ 0.1 in) | 0.5\n | 0.5\n | 0.3\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.1\n | 0.6\n | 2.0\n |\n| Source: NOAA[22][23] |\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nArchaeologists have divided the long span of Zion's human history into three cultural periods: the Archaic, Protohistoric and Historic periods. Each period is characterized by distinctive technological and social adaptations.\n\n\n\n### Archaic period[edit]\n\n\nThe first human presence in the region dates to 8,000 years ago when family groups camped where they could hunt or collect plants and seeds.[24] About 2,000 years ago, some groups began growing corn and other crops, leading to an increasingly sedentary lifestyle.[25] Later groups in this period built permanent villages called pueblos. Archaeologists call this the Archaic period and it lasted until c. 500.[26] Baskets, cordage nets, and yucca fiber sandals have been found and dated to this period. The Archaic toolkits included flaked stone knives, drills, and stemmed dart points. The dart points were attached to wooden shafts and propelled by throwing devices called atlatls.[26]\n\n\nBy c. 300, some of the archaic groups developed into an early branch of seminomadic Anasazi, the Basketmakers.[26] Basketmaker sites have grass- or stone-lined storage cists and shallow, partially underground dwellings called pithouses. They were hunters and gatherers who supplemented their diet with limited agriculture. Locally collected pine nuts were important for food and trade.\n\n\n\n### Protohistoric period[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kaun huts were used by Southern Paiute\nBoth the Virgin Anasazi and the Parowan Fremont disappeared from the archaeological record of southwestern Utah by c. 1300.[26] Extended droughts in the 11th and 12th centuries, interspersed with catastrophic flooding, may have made horticulture impossible in this arid region.[26]\n\n\nTradition and archaeological evidence hold that their replacements were Numic-speaking cousins of the Virgin Anasazi, such as the Southern Paiute and Ute.[26] The newcomers migrated on a seasonal basis up and down valleys in search of wild seeds and game animals.[27] Some, particularly the Southern Paiute, also planted fields of corn, sunflowers, and squash to supplement their diet.[27] These more sedentary groups made brownware vessels that were used for storage and cooking.[26]\n\n\n\n### Exploration and settlement[edit]\n\n\nThe Historic period begins in the late 18th century[26] with the exploration of southern Utah by padre Silvestre Vélez de Escalante and padre Francisco Atanasio Domínguez. The padres passed near what is now the Kolob Canyons Visitor Center on October 13, 1776, becoming the first people of European descent known to visit the area.[28] In 1825, trapper and trader Jedediah Smith explored some of the downstream areas while under contract with the American Fur Company.[28]\n\n\nIn 1847, Mormon farmers from the Salt Lake area became the first people of European descent to settle the Virgin River region.[16] In 1851, the Parowan and Cedar City areas were settled by Mormons who used the Kolob Canyons area for timber, and for grazing cattle, sheep, and horses.[29] They prospected for mineral deposits, and diverted Kolob water to irrigate crops in the valley below. Mormon settlers named the area *Kolob* which in Mormon scripture is the heavenly place nearest the residence of God.[30]\n\n\n\n![](image)A ranch near the mouth of Zion Canyon (c. 1910s)\nSettlements had expanded 30 miles (48 km) south to the lower Virgin River by 1858.[16] That year, a Southern Paiute guide led young Mormon missionary and interpreter Nephi Johnson into the upper Virgin River area and Zion Canyon.[28] Johnson wrote a favorable report about the agricultural potential of the upper Virgin River basin, and returned later that year to found the town of Virgin. In 1861 or 1862, Joseph Black made the arduous journey to Zion Canyon and was very impressed by its beauty.[5]\n\n\nThe floor of Zion Canyon was settled in 1863 by Isaac Behunin, who farmed corn, tobacco, and fruit trees.[5] The Behunin family lived in Zion Canyon near the site of today's Zion Lodge during the summer, and wintered in Springdale. Behunin is credited with naming Zion, a reference to the place of peace mentioned in the Bible.[5] Two more families settled Zion Canyon in the next couple of years, bringing with them cattle and other domesticated animals. The canyon floor was farmed until Zion became a Monument in 1909.[16]\n\n\nThe Powell Geographic Expedition of 1869 entered the area after their first trip through the Grand Canyon.[16] John Wesley Powell visited Zion Canyon in 1872 and named it *Mukuntuweap*, under the impression that that was the Paiute name.[31] Powell Survey photographers John K. Hillers and James Fennemore first visited the Zion Canyon and Kolob Plateau region in the spring of 1872.[16] Hillers returned in April 1873 to add more photographs to the \"Virgin River Series\" of photographs and stereographs.[32] Hillers described wading the canyon for four days and nearly freezing to death to take his photographs.[32]\n\n\n\n### Protection and tourism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Painting of Zion Canyon by Frederick S. Dellenbaugh (1903)\nPaintings of the canyon by Frederick S. Dellenbaugh were exhibited at the Saint Louis World's Fair in 1904,[16] followed by a favorable article in *Scribner's Magazine* the next year. The article and paintings, along with previously created photographs, paintings, and reports, led to President William Howard Taft's proclamation on July 31, 1909, that created Mukuntuweap National Monument.[28] In 1917, the acting director of the newly created National Park Service visited the canyon and proposed changing its name from the locally unpopular Mukuntuweap to Zion, a name used by the local Mormon community.[33] The United States Congress added more land and established Zion National Park on November 19, 1919.[5] A separate Zion National Monument, the Kolob Canyons area, was proclaimed on January 22, 1937, and was incorporated into the park on July 11, 1956.[34]\n\n\nTravel to the area before it was a national park was rare due to its remote location, lack of accommodations, and the absence of real roads in southern Utah. Old wagon roads were upgraded to the first automobile roads starting about 1910, and the road into Zion Canyon was built in 1917 leading to the Grotto, short of the present road that now ends at the Temple of Sinawava.[26]\n\n\n\n![](image)1938 poster of Zion National Park\nTouring cars could reach Zion Canyon by the summer of 1917.[26] The first visitor lodging in Zion Canyon, called Wylie Camp, was established that same year as a tent camp.[26] The Utah Parks Company, a subsidiary of the Union Pacific Railroad, acquired Wylie Camp in 1923, and offered ten-day rail/bus tours to Zion, nearby Bryce Canyon, the Kaibab Plateau, and the North Rim of the Grand Canyon.[35] The Zion Lodge complex was built in 1925 at the site of the Wylie tent camp.[26] Architect Gilbert Stanley Underwood designed the Zion Lodge in a rustic architectural style, while the Utah Parks Company funded the construction.[26]\n\n\n\n### Infrastructure improvements[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Historical buildings and structures of Zion National Park\n\nWork on the Zion Mount Carmel Highway started in 1927 to enable reliable access between Springdale and the east side of the park.[5] The road opened in 1930 and park visit and travel in the area greatly increased.[36] The most famous feature of the Zion – Mount Carmel Highway is its 1.1-mile (1.8 km) tunnel, which has six large windows cut through the massive sandstone cliff.[16]\n\n\nIn 1896, local rancher John Winder improved the Native American footpath up Echo Canyon, which later became the East Rim Trail.[37] Entrepreneur David Flanigan used this trail in 1900 to build cableworks that lowered lumber into Zion Canyon from Cable Mountain. More than 200,000 board feet (470 m3) of lumber were lowered by 1906.[37] The auto road was extended to the Temple of Sinawava, and a trail built from there 1 mile (1.6 km) to the start of the Narrows.[38] Angel's Landing Trail was constructed in 1926 and two suspension bridges were built over the Virgin River.[31] Other trails were constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the 1930s.[31]\n\n\n\n### More recent history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Altar of Sacrifice (center) with reddish, blood-like streaks\nZion National Park has been featured in numerous films, including *The Deadwood Coach* (1924), *Arizona Bound* (1927), *Nevada* (1927), *Ramrod* (1947) and *Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid* (1969).[39]\n\n\nZion Canyon Scenic Drive provides access to Zion Canyon. Traffic congestion in the narrow canyon was recognized as a major problem in the 1990s and a public transportation system using propane-powered shuttle buses was instituted in the year 2000.[40] As part of its shuttle fleet, Zion has two electric trams each holding up to 36 passengers.[41] Usually from early April through late October, the scenic drive in Zion Canyon is closed to private vehicles and visitors ride the shuttle buses.[40] The National Park Service has contracted the management of the shuttle bus system to transit operator RATP Dev.[42]\n\n\n\n![](image)Zion shuttle bus stops are marked with numbers\nOn April 12, 1995, heavy rains triggered a landslide that blocked the Virgin River in Zion Canyon.[43] Over a period of two hours, the river carved away part of the only exit road from the canyon, trapping 450 guests and employees at the Zion Lodge.[43] A one-lane, temporary road was constructed within 24 hours to allow evacuation of the Lodge.[43] A more stable albeit temporary road was completed on May 25, 1995, to allow summer visitors to access the canyon.[43] This road was replaced with a permanent road during the first half of 1996.[43]\n\n\nThe Zion–Mount Carmel Highway can be travelled year-round. Access for oversized vehicles requires a special permit, and is limited to daytime hours, as traffic through the tunnel must be one way to accommodate large vehicles. The 5-mile (8.0 km)-long Kolob Canyons Road was built to provide access to the Kolob Canyons section of the park.[44] This road often closes in the winter.\n\n\nIn March 2009, President Barack Obama signed into law the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009, which designated and further protected 124,406 acres (50,345 ha) of park land, about 85% of the park, as the Zion Wilderness.[45]\n\n\nIn September 2015, flooding trapped a party of seven in Keyhole Canyon, a slot canyon in the park. The flash flood killed all seven members of the group, whose remains were located after a search lasting several days.[46]\n\n\nIn 2017, some scenes from the TV series *Extinct* were shot in the park.[47]\n\n\nOn March 25, 2020, the park campgrounds were closed to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.[48]\n\n\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area\n\n![](image)The Three Patriarchs in Zion Canyon are made of Navajo Sandstone\nThe nine known exposed geologic formations in Zion National Park are part of a super-sequence of rock units called the Grand Staircase. Together, these formations represent about 150 million years of mostly Mesozoic-aged sedimentation in that part of North America. The formations exposed in the Zion area were deposited as sediment in very different environments:\n\n\n\n* The warm, shallow (sometimes advancing or retreating) sea of the Kaibab and Moenkopi formations\n* Streams, ponds, and lakes of the Chinle, Moenave, and Kayenta formations\n* The vast desert of the Navajo and Temple Cap formations\n* The dry near-shore environment of the Carmel Formation\n\n\n![](image)The Kolob Canyons are a set of finger canyons cut into the Kolob Plateau. Timber Top Mountain to right.\nUplift affected the entire region, known as the Colorado Plateaus, by slowly raising these formations more than 10,000 feet (3,000 m) higher than where they were deposited.[49] This steepened the stream gradient of the ancestral Virgin and other rivers on the plateau.\n\n\nThe faster-moving streams took advantage of uplift-created joints in the rocks. Eventually, all Cenozoic-aged formations were removed and gorges were cut into the plateaus. Zion Canyon was cut by the North Fork of the Virgin River in this way. During the later part of this process, lava flows and cinder cones covered parts of the area.[50]\n\n\nHigh water volume in wet seasons does most of the downcutting in the main canyon. These flood events are responsible for transporting most of the 3 million short tons (2.7 million metric tons) of rock and sediment that the Virgin River transports yearly.[16] The Virgin cuts away its canyon faster than its tributaries can cut away their own streambeds, so tributaries end in waterfalls from hanging valleys where they meet the Virgin.[16] The valley between the peaks of the Twin Brothers is a notable example of a hanging valley in the canyon.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n**Table of formations exposed in Zion National Park**[51]\n| **Rock layer** | **Appearance** | **Location** | **Deposition** | **Rock type** | **Photo** |\n| Dakota Formation | Cliffs | Top of Horse Ranch Mountain | Streams | Conglomerate and sandstone | **![Dakota Sandstone](image)** |\n| Carmel Formation | Cliffs | Mount Carmel Junction | Shallow sea and coastal desert | Limestone, sandstone and gypsum | **![Carmel Formation](image)** |\n| Temple Cap Formation | Cliffs | Top of The West Temple | Desert | Sandstone | **![Temple Cap Formation atop Navajo Sandstone](image)** |\n| Navajo Sandstone | Steep cliffs 1,600 to 2,200 ft (490 to 670 m) thick; red lower layers are colored by iron oxides | Tall cliffs of Zion Canyon; highest exposure is West Temple; cross-bedding shows well at Checkerboard Mesa (photo) | Sand dunes covered 150,000 sq mi (390,000 km2); shifting winds during deposition created cross-bedding | Sandstone | **![Navajo Sandstone](image)** |\n| Kayenta Formation | Rocky slopes | Throughout canyon | Streams | Siltstone and sandstone | **![Kayenta Formation](image)** |\n| Moenave Formation | Slopes and ledges | Lower red cliffs seen from Zion Human History Museum | Streams and ponds | Siltstone and sandstone | **![Moenave Formation](image)** |\n| Chinle Formation | Purplish slopes | Above Rockville | Streams | Shale, loose clay and conglomerate | **![Chinle Formation](image)** |\n| Moenkopi Formation | Chocolate cliffs with white bands | Rocky slopes from Virgin to Rockville | Shallow sea | Shale, siltstone, sandstone, mudstone, and limestone | **![Moenkopi Formation](image)** |\n| Kaibab Limestone | Cliffs | Hurricane Cliffs along I-15 near Kolob Canyons | Shallow sea | Limestone | **![Hurricane Cliffs/Kaibab Limestone](image)** |\n\n\n## Biology[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Taylor Creek with Horse Ranch Mountain in background. Desert, riparian, woodland, and coniferous forest habitats are all visible.\nThe Great Basin, Mojave Desert, and Colorado Plateau converge at Zion and the Kolob canyons.[52] This, along with the varied topography of canyon–mesa country, differing soil types, and uneven water availability, provides diverse habitat for the equally diverse mix of plants and animals that live in the area. The park is home to 289 bird, 79 mammals, 28 reptiles, 7 fish, and 6 amphibian species.[53] These organisms make their homes in one or more of four life zones found in the park: desert, riparian, woodland, and coniferous forest.[54]\n\n\nDesert conditions persist on canyon bottoms and rocky ledges away from perennial streams. Sagebrush, prickly pear cactus, and rabbitbrush, along with sacred datura and Indian paintbrush, are common.[55] Utah penstemon and golden aster can also be found.[56] Milkvetch and prince's plume are found in pockets of selenium-rich soils.[54]\n\n\nCommon daytime animals include mule deer, rock squirrels, pinyon jays, and whiptail and collared lizards. Desert cottontails,[57] jackrabbits, and Merriam's kangaroo rats come out at night. Cougars, bobcats, coyotes, badgers, gray foxes, and ring-tail cats are the top predators.[57]\n\n\nCooler conditions persist at mid-elevation slopes, from 3,900 to 5,500 feet (1,200 to 1,700 m).[54] Stunted forests of pinyon pine and juniper coexist here with manzanita shrubs, cliffrose, serviceberry, scrub oak, and yucca.[54] Stands of ponderosa pine, Gambel oak, manzanita and aspen populate the mesas and cliffs above 6,000 feet (1,800 m).[54]\n\n\n\n![](image)Desert bighorn sheep are often visible near the roadway in the park.\nGolden eagles, red-tailed hawks, peregrine falcons, and white-throated swifts can be seen in the area.[58] Desert bighorn sheep were reintroduced in the park in 1973.[59] California condors were reintroduced in the Arizona Strip and in 2014 the first successful breeding of condors in the park was confirmed.[60][61] Nineteen species of bat also live in the area.[62]\n\n\nBoxelder, Fremont cottonwood, maple, and willow dominate riparian plant communities.[54] Animals such as bank beavers, flannel-mouth suckers, gnatcatchers, dippers, canyon wrens, the virgin spinedace, and water striders all make their homes in the riparian zones.[63]\n\n\n\n## Activities[edit]\n\n\nRangers at the visitor centers in Zion Canyon and Kolob Canyons can help visitors plan their stay. Guided horseback riding trips, nature walks, and evening programs are available from late March to early November.[64] The Junior Ranger Program for children ages 4 and up is active year-round at the Nature Center, Human History Museum, and the visitor centers.[65] A bookstore attached to the Zion Canyon visitor center offers books, maps, and souvenirs.[66] The Grotto in Zion Canyon, the visitor center, and the viewpoint at the end of Kolob Canyons Road have the only designated picnic sites.[14]\n\n\n\nTrails\n![](image)The Subway, a slot canyon within the Kolob Terrace section\nSeven trails with round-trip times of half an hour (Weeping Rock) to 4 hours (Angels Landing) are found in Zion Canyon.[67] Two popular trails, Taylor Creek (4 hours round trip) and Kolob Arch (8 hours round trip), are in the Kolob Canyons section of the park, near Cedar City.[67] Hiking up into The Narrows from the Temple of Sinawava is popular in summer, but hiking beyond Big Springs requires a permit. The entire Narrows from Chamberlain's Ranch is a 16-mile one way trip that typically takes 12 hours of strenuous hiking.[68] A shorter alternative is to enter the Narrows via Orderville Canyon. Both Orderville and the full Narrows require a back country permit. Entrance to the Parunuweap Canyon section of the park downstream of Labyrinth Falls is prohibited. Other often-used backcountry trails include the West Rim and LaVerkin Creek.[69] The more primitive sections of Zion include the Kolob Terrace and the Kolob Canyons.[14] A network of trails totaling 50 miles in distance connect Zion's northwest corner of the park (Lee Pass Trailhead) to its southeast section (East Rim Trailhead). Popularly known as the Zion Traverse, the route offers backpackers a diverse experience of the park.\n\n\nZion is a center for rock climbing, with short walls like Spaceshot, Moonlight Buttress, Prodigal Son, Ashtar Command, and Touchstone being the most popular, highly rated routes.[70][71]\n\n\n\nCamping and lodging\n![](image)Zion Lodge accommodations\nLodging in the park is available at Zion Lodge, located halfway through Zion Canyon. Just outside the park more lodging is available in Springdale.[72]\n\n\nZion has three campgrounds: South and Watchman at the far southern side of the park, and a primitive site at Lava Point in the middle of the park off Kolob Terrace Road.[73] Overnight camping in the backcountry requires permits.[74]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of national parks of the United States\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Zion National Park\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Iron County, Kane County and Washington County, Utah\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Listing of acreage – December 31, 2012\" (XLSX).

This 8 mi (13 km) one-way climb has an elevation gain of 4,850 ft (1,480 m). The vast east face, including the area known as The Diamond, is home to many classic big wall rock climbing routes. Many of the highest peaks have technical ice and rock routes on them, ranging from short scrambles to long multi-pitch climbs.[89] Bouldering is popular in the park as well, as it is often considered a \"mecca for boulderers around the world\", particularly the Emerald Lake and Chaos Canyon areas.[90]\n\n\nFishing is permitted at many of the park's lakes and streams. Four trout species inhabit park waters: rainbow, brook, cutthroat, and German brown trout.[86] The greenback cutthroat, once widespread in Eastern Colorado, is currently listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGem Lake is high among the rounded granite domes of Lumpy Ridge. Untouched by glaciation, this outcrop of 1.8 billion-year-old granite has been sculpted by wind and chemical erosion into a backbone-like ridge. Pillars, potholes, and balanced rocks are found around the midpoint of the trail, along with views of the Estes Valley and Continental Divide.[43] Potts Puddle trail is accessible from the Black Canyon trail.[43]\n\n\n\n### Region 4: Heart of the park[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bear Lake\nRegion 4 is the heart of the park with easy road and trail access, great views, and lake hikes including the most popular trails.[36] Flattop Mountain is a tundra hike and the easiest hike to the Continental Divide in the park. Crossing over Flattop Mountain, the hike to Hallett Peak passes through three climate zones, traversing the ridge that supports Tyndall Glacier and finally ascending to the summit of Hallett Peak.[45]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhile the glaciation periods are largely in the past, the park still has several small glaciers.[61] The glaciers include Andrews, Sprague, Tyndall, Taylor, Rowe, Mills, and Moomaw Glaciers.[35]\n\n\n\n## Ecology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ecology of the Rocky Mountains\n\n![](image)Clickable examples of ecosystem elements\nAccording to the A. W. Kuchler U.S. Potential natural vegetation Types, Rocky Mountain National Park encompasses three classifications; an Alpine tundra & Barren (*52*) vegetation type with an Alpine tundra (*11*) vegetation form, a Western Spruce/Fir (*15*) vegetation type with a Rocky Mountain Conifer Forest (*3*) vegetation form, and a Pine/Douglas fir (*18*) vegetation type with a Rocky Mountain Conifer Forest (*3*) vegetation form.[62]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBaker Pass crosses the Continental Divide through the Never Summer Mountains and into the Michigan River drainage to the west of Mount Nimbus[37]—a drainage that feeds streams and rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico.[29] Other mountain passes are La Poudre Pass and Thunder Pass, which was once used by stage coaches and is a route to Michigan Lakes. Little Yellowstone has geological features similar to the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone. The Green Mountain trail once was a wagon road used to haul hay from Big Meadows. Flattop Mountain, which can be accessed from the eastern and western sides of the park, is near Green Mountain. Shadow Mountain Lookout—a wildfire observation tower—is on the National Register of Historic Places.[37] Paradise Park Natural Area is an essentially hidden and protected wild area with no maintained trails penetrating it.[40]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSkeleton Gulch, Cascade Falls, North Inlet Falls, Granite Falls, and Adams Falls are found in the west side of the park. The west side lakes include Bowen Lake, Lake Verna, Lake of the Clouds, Haynach Lakes, Timber Lake, Lone Pine Lake, Lake Nanita, and Lake Nokoni.[37]\n\n\n\n### Region 2: Alpine region[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The alpine tundra of Rocky Mountain National Park taken along the Tundra Communities Trail at approximately 12,000 feet.\nRegion 2 is the alpine region of the park with accessible tundra trails at high elevations—an area known for its spectacular vistas.[36] Within this region is Mount Ida, with tundra slopes and a wide-open view of the Continental Divide. Forest Canyon Pass is near the top of the Old Ute Trail that once linked villages across the Continental Divide.[41]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Climate data for Beaver Meadows Visitor Center, Rocky Mountain National Park.

This diversity is due to the park's varying topography, which creates a variety of habitats. However, some species have been extirpated from the park, including gray wolf, wolverine, grizzly bear, and American bison. Moose are commonly seen in the park, but they were not historically recorded as being part of this particular area of the Rocky Mountains.[75]\n\n\n\n#### Elk[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe history of Rocky Mountain National Park began when Paleo-Indians traveled along what is now Trail Ridge Road to hunt and forage for food.[13] Ute and Arapaho people subsequently hunted and camped in the area.[14][15] In 1820, the Long Expedition, led by Stephen H. Long for whom Longs Peak was named, approached the Rockies via the Platte River.[16][17] Settlers began arriving in the mid-1800s,[18] displacing the Native Americans who mostly left the area voluntarily by 1860,[19] while others were removed to reservations by 1878.[15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe park is home to some 2,000 to 3,000 elk in summer, and between 800 and 1,000 elk spend the winter within its boundaries. Because of lack of predators such as wolves, the National Park Service culls around 50 elk each winter.[76] Overgrazing by elk has become a major problem in the park's riparian areas, so much so that the NPS fences them out of many critical wetland habitats to let willows and aspens grow. The program seems to be working, as the deciduous wetland plants thrive within the fencing. Many people think the elk herd is too large, but are reluctant to reintroduce predators because of its proximity to large human populations and ranches.[77]\n\n\n\n#### Other ungulates[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Andrews, Thomas G.

There are three backcountry campsites.[45] Other sites in the area are The Loch, Loch Vale, Mill Creek Basin, Andrews Glacier, Sky Point, Timberline Falls, Upper Beaver Meadows, and Storm Pass.[45]\n\n\n\n### Region 5: Waterfalls and backcountry[edit]\n\n\nRegion 5, known for waterfalls and backcountry, is south of Estes Park and contains Longs Peak—the park's iconic fourteener—and the Wild Basin area.[36] Other peaks and passes include Lily Mountain, Estes Cone, Twin Sisters, Boulder-Grand Pass, and Granite Pass.[48] Eugenia Mine operated about the late-19th to early-20th century, with some old equipment and a log cabin remaining.[48] Sites and trails include Boulder Field, Wild Basin Trail, and Homer Rouse Memorial Trail.[48]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nColorado has one of the most diverse plant and animal environments of the United States, partially due to the dramatic temperature differences arising from varying elevation levels and topography. In dry climates, the average temperature drops 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit with every 1,000 foot increase in elevation (9.8 degrees Celsius per 1,000 meters). Most of Colorado is semi-arid with the mountains receiving the greatest amount of precipitation in the state.[63]\n\n\nThe Continental Divide runs north to south through the park, creating a climatic division. Ancient glaciers carved the topography into a range of ecological zones.[31] The east side of the Divide tends to be drier with heavily glaciated peaks and cirques. The west side of the park is wetter with more lush, deep forests.[64]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMany other ungulates reside in the park, including bighorn sheep, moose, and mule deer. Bison were eliminated from the park in the 1800s, as were pronghorn and moose, the latter of which was restored to the area in 1978. Moose are now frequently seen in the park, especially on the park's west side.[78] The park's bighorn sheep population has recovered and is estimated at 350 animals.[79]\n\n\n\n#### Predators[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nColorado River system\n |\n| --- |\n| Jurisdictions | * United States\n\t+ Arizona\n\t+ California\n\t+ Colorado\n\t+ Nevada\n\t+ New Mexico\n\t+ Utah\n\t+ Wyoming\n* Mexico\n\t+ Baja California\n\t+ Sonora\n | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)\n |\n| Canyons | * Byers Canyon\n* Gore Canyon\n* Red Gorge\n* Glenwood Canyon\n* De Beque Canyon\n* Horsethief Canyon\n* Ruby Canyon\n* Westwater Canyon\n* Cataract Canyon\n* Narrow Canyon\n* Glen Canyon\n* Grand Canyon\n\t+ Marble Canyon\n\t+ Granite Gorge\n\t+ Middle Granite Gorge\n\t+ Lower Granite Gorge\n* Grand Wash Canyon\n* Iceberg Canyon\n* Virgin Canyon\n* Boulder Canyon\n* Black Canyon\n* Pyramid Canyon\n* Mohave Canyon\n |\n| Natural features | * River course\n* Rocky Mountains\n* Colorado River Basin\n* Colorado Plateau\n* Grand Lake\n* Horseshoe Bend\n* Sonoran Desert\n* Mojave Desert\n* Lower Colorado River Valley\n* Mohave Valley\n* Parker Valley\n* Palo Verde Valley\n* Colorado Desert\n* Alamo River\n* New River\n* Salton Sea\n* Imperial Valley\n* Delta\n* Montague Island\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Climate data for Bear Lake Ranger Station, Rocky Mountain National Park.

Galen Clark and others lobbied to protect Yosemite Valley from development, ultimately leading to President Abraham Lincoln's signing of the Yosemite Grant of 1864 that declared Yosemite as federally preserved land.[13] In 1890 John Muir led a successful movement to motivate Congress to establish Yosemite Valley and its surrounding areas as a National Park. This helped pave the way for the National Park System.[13] Yosemite draws about four million visitors annually.[14] Most visitors spend the majority of their time in the valley's seven square miles (18 km2).[8] The park set a visitation record in 2016, surpassing five million visitors for the first time.[15]\n\n\n\n\n## Toponym[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n121. **^** \"Yosemite Valley will close due to fire.

The park is managed by the National Park Service and covers 759,620 acres (1,187 sq mi; 3,074 km2)[3] in four counties – centered in Tuolumne and Mariposa, extending north and east to Mono and south to Madera. Designated a World Heritage Site in 1984, Yosemite is internationally recognized for its cliffs, waterfalls, clear streams, giant sequoia groves, lakes, mountains, meadows, glaciers, and biological diversity.[8] Almost 95 percent of the park is designated wilderness.[9] Yosemite is one of the largest and least fragmented habitat blocks in the Sierra Nevada.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n72. **^** National Park Service. \"Ackerson Meadow Gifted to Yosemite National Park\".

The popular Half Dome hike to the summit of Half Dome and requires a permit whenever the cables are up (usually from Memorial Day weekend to Columbus Day).[127] A maximum of 300 hikers, selected by lottery, are permitted to advance beyond the base of the subdome each day, including 225 day hikers and 75 backpackers.[128]\n\n\nThe park can be divided into five sections—Yosemite Valley, Wawona/Mariposa Grove/Glacier Point, Tuolumne Meadows, Hetch Hetchy, and Crane Flat/White Wolf.[129] Numerous books describe park trails, while the National Park Service provides free information.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Bridalveil Fall and El Capitan, by Carleton Watkins (c. 1880)\nMuir and his Sierra Club continued to lobby the government and influential people for the creation of a unified Yosemite National Park. In May 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt camped with Muir near Glacier Point for three days. On that trip, Muir convinced Roosevelt to take control of Yosemite Valley and Mariposa Grove away from California and return it to the federal government. In 1906, Roosevelt signed the enabling bill.[62]\n\n\n\n### National Park Service[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Newberry Mountains\n* Nopah Range\n* North Algodones Dunes\n* North Mesquite Mountains\n* Old Woman Mountains\n* Orocopia Mountains\n* Otay Mountain\n* Owens Peak\n* Pahrump Valley\n* Palen/McCoy\n* Palo Verde Mountains\n* Picacho Peak\n* Piper Mountain\n* Piute Mountains\n* Red Buttes\n* Resting Spring Range\n* Rice Valley\n* Riverside Mountains\n* Rodman Mountains\n* Sacatar Trail\n* Saddle Peak Hills\n* San Gorgonio\n* Santa Lucia\n* Santa Rosa\n* Sawtooth Mountains\n* Sespe\n* Sheephole Valley\n* South Nopah Range\n* Stateline\n* Stepladder Mountains\n* Surprise Canyon\n* Sylvania Mountains\n* Trilobite\n* Turtle Mountains\n* Whipple Mountains\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n| National Marine Sanctuaries\n |\n| --- |\n| * Channel Islands\n* Cordell Bank\n* Greater Farallones\n* Monterey Bay\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n| National Estuarine Research Reserves\n |\n| --- |\n| * Elkhorn Slough\n* San Francisco Bay\n* Tijuana River\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Official website of the National Park Service\n* \"Providing for Yosemite's Future — Yosemite Conservancy\". *yosemite.org*.

Tuolumne Meadows Lodge, Tioga Pass Road, and campgrounds at Tenaya and Merced lakes were also completed in 1916.[63] Automobiles started to enter the park in ever-increasing numbers following the opening of all-weather highways to the park. The Yosemite Museum was founded in 1926 through the efforts of Ansel Franklin Hall.[64] In the 1920s, the museum featured Native Americans practicing traditional crafts, and many Southern Sierra Miwok continued to live in Yosemite Valley until they were evicted from the park in the 1960s.[65] Although NPS helped create the museum, its early actions and organizational values were dismissive of Yosemite Natives and the Ahwahneechee.[12] NPS in the early 20th century criticized and restricted the expression of indigenous culture and behavior. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1918, Clare Marie Hodges was hired as the first female Park Ranger in Yosemite.[68] Following Hodges in 1921, Enid Michael was hired as a seasonal Park Ranger[68] and continued to serve in that position for 20 years.[68]\n\n\n\n![](image)O'Shaughnessy Dam in Hetch Hetchy Valley\nIn 1937, conservationist Rosalie Edge, head of the Emergency Conservation Committee (ECC), successfully lobbied Congress to purchase about 8,000 acres of old-growth sugar pines on the perimeter of Yosemite National Park that were to be logged.[69]\n\n\nIn 1984, preservationists persuaded Congress to designate 677,600 acres (274,200 ha), or about 89 percent of the park, as the Yosemite Wilderness—making it a wilderness area that thereby became off-limits to development.[70] NPS reduced artificial inducements to visit the park, such as the *Firefall*, in which red-hot embers were pushed off a cliff near Glacier Point at night. Traffic congestion and parking in Yosemite Valley during the summer months has become a concern.[71]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)A view of the park and Vernal Fall, photographed by photographer Eadweard Muybridge in 1872.\nConcerned by the impact of commercial interests, citizens including Galen Clark and Senator John Conness advocated to protect the area.[49] The 38th United States Congress passed legislation that was signed by President Abraham Lincoln on June 30, 1864, creating the Yosemite Grant.[50][51] This is the first time land was set aside specifically for preservation and public use by the U.S. government, and set a precedent for the 1872 creation of Yellowstone national park, the nation's first.[13] Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove were ceded to California as a state park, and a board of commissioners was established two years later.[52]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Mule deer in Yosemite Valley\nThe park has an elevation range from 2,127 to 13,114 feet (648 to 3,997 m) and contains five major vegetation zones: chaparral and oak woodland, lower montane forest, upper montane forest, subalpine zone, and alpine. Of California's 7,000 plant species, approximately 50 percent occur in the Sierra Nevada and more than 20 percent within the park. The park contains suitable habitat for more than 160 rare plants, with rare local geologic formations and unique soils characterizing the restricted ranges many of these plants occupy.[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| People | * John Muir\n* Stephen T.

All overnight trips into the back country require a wilderness permit[130] and most require approved bear-resistant food storage.[131]\n\n\n\n### Driving[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of Yosemite destinations\n\nWhile some locations in Yosemite are accessible only on foot, other locations can be reached via road, including for viewing the night sky. The most famous road is Tioga Road.[132]\n\n\nBicycles are allowed on the roads, but only 12 miles (19 km) of paved off-road trails ae available in Yosemite Valley itself; mountain biking is not allowed.[133]\n\n\n\n### Climbing[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Climbing the Narrows in Sentinel Rock\nRock climbing is an important part of Yosemite.[134] In particular the valley is surrounded by summits such as Half Dome and El Capitan. Camp 4 is a walk-in campground in the Valley that was instrumental in the development of rock climbing as a sport, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[135] Climbers can generally be spotted in the snow-free months on anything from ten-foot-high (3 m) boulders to the 3,300-foot (1.0 km) face of El Capitan. Classes on rock climbing are offered there.\n\n\n\n### Winter activities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A ranger-guided snowshoe walk in the park\nSome roads close in winter. Downhill skiing is available at the Badger Pass Ski Area—the oldest downhill skiing area in California, operating from mid-December through early April.[136] Much of the park is open to cross-country skiing and snowshoeing, and backcountry ski huts are available.[137][138] Wilderness permits are required for backcountry overnight ski trips.[130]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Bridalveil Fall flows from a U-shaped hanging valley that was created by a tributary glacier.\nYosemite is famous for its high concentration of waterfalls in a small area. Numerous sheer drops, glacial steps and hanging valleys in the park feature spectacular cascades, especially during April, May, and June (as the snow melts). Located in Yosemite Valley, Yosemite Falls is the fourth tallest waterfall in North America at 2,425 feet (739 m) in accordance with the World Waterfall Data Base.[87] Also in the valley is the much lower volume Ribbon Falls, which has the highest single vertical drop, 1,612 feet (491 m).[83] Perhaps the most prominent of the valley waterfalls is Bridalveil Fall. Wapama Falls in Hetch Hetchy Valley is another notable waterfall. Hundreds of ephemeral waterfalls become active in the park after heavy rains or melting snowpack.[88]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHydrologic processes, including glaciation, flooding, and fluvial geomorphic response, have been fundamental in creating park landforms.[84] The park contains approximately 3,200 lakes (greater than 100 m2), two reservoirs, and 1,700 miles (2,700 km) of streams.[85] Wetlands flourish in valley bottoms throughout the park, and are often hydrologically linked to nearby lakes and rivers through seasonal flooding and groundwater. Meadow habitats, distributed at elevations from 3,000 to 11,000 feet (910 to 3,350 m) in the park, are generally wetlands, as are the riparian habitats found on the banks of Yosemite's watercourses.[86]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Cathedral Peak\nYosemite Valley represents only one percent of the park area. The Tunnel View gives a view of the valley. El Capitan is a prominent granite cliff that looms over the valley, is a rock climbing favorite because of its diverse climbing routes and year-round accessibility. Granite domes such as Sentinel Dome and Half Dome rise 3,000 and 4,800 feet (910 and 1,460 m), respectively, above the valley floor. The park contains dozens of other granite domes.[80]\n\n\nThe high country of Yosemite contains other important features such as Tuolumne Meadows, Dana Meadows, the Clark Range, the Cathedral Range, and the Kuna Crest. The Sierra crest and the Pacific Crest Trail run through Yosemite. Mount Dana and Mount Gibbs are peaks of red metamorphic rock. Granite peaks include Mount Conness. Mount Lyell is the highest point in the park, standing at 13,120 feet (4,000 m). The Lyell Glacier is the largest glacier in the and one of the few remaining in the Sierras.[81]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n111. **^** Bolsinger, Charles L.; Waddell, Karen L.

During late July and early August, 2018, the Valley and other sections of the park, temporarily closed due to the Ferguson Fire at its western boundary.[121] The closing was the largest in almost thirty years.[122]\n\n\n\n## Activities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tunnel tree at Yosemite National Park in May 2022\n![](image)Yosemite Valley Shuttle System bus, a free bus service\n### Public access[edit]\n\n\nYosemite Valley is open year-round for hiking, and commercial recreational programs are available.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Peaks >14,000 ft | * Whitney\n* Williamson\n* North Palisade\n* Sill\n* Russell\n* Split\n* Langley\n* Tyndall\n* Muir\n* Middle Palisade\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Northern peaks | * Lola\n* Castle\n* Granite Chief\n* Rose\n* Tallac\n* Pyramid\n* Freel\n |\n| Central peaks | * Red Lake\n* Round Top\n* Mokelumne\n* Sonora\n* Leavitt\n* Dana\n* Lyell\n* Banner\n* Ritter\n* Mammoth\n |\n| Southern peaks | * Humphreys\n* Tom\n* Bear Creek Spire\n* Darwin\n* Agassiz\n* Kaweah\n* Brewer\n* Olancha\n* Kern\n* Double\n |\n| Climbing | * Peak list\n* First ascents\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTraffic congestion in the valley is heavy during peak summer season (June to August) and a free shuttle bus system operates in the valley. Parking in the valley during the summer is often full.[123] Transit options are available from Fresno and Merced.[124] Yosemite has 13 official campgrounds. [125]\n\n\nThe natural and cultural history of Yosemite Valley is presented at the Yosemite Valley Visitor Center, the adjoining Yosemite Museum, and the Nature Center at Happy Isles. The parks' two National Historic Landmarks are the Sierra Club's LeConte Memorial Lodge (Yosemite's first public visitor center), and the Ahwahnee Hotel. Camp 4 is on the National Register of Historic Places.[126]\n\n\nIn the winter, the park is snowed in. Tuolumne Meadows has great hiking, rock climbing, and mountain climbing.\n\n\n\n### Hiking[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n48. **^** Gene Rose (March 2003). \"The Ahwahnee: Yosemite Grandeur\". *Skiing Heritage Journal*.

The most serious current threats include loss of a natural fire regime, exotic species, air pollution, habitat fragmentation, and climate change. On a more local basis, factors such as road kills and the availability of human food have affected some wildlife species.[115][116]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Stewarts Point\n* Swami's\n* Tijuana River Mouth\n* Upper Newport Bay\n* Van Damme\n* Vandenberg\n* White Rock (Cambria)\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Bureau of Land Management National Conservation Lands\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nYosemite National Park has documented the presence more than 130 non-native plant species within park boundaries. They were introduced into Yosemite following the migration of early Euro-American settlers in the late 1850s. Natural and human-caused disturbances, such as wildland fires and construction activities, have contributed to a rapid increase in the spread of non-native plants. Some of these species invade and displace the native plant communities, impacting park resources. Non-native plants can bring about significant ecosystem changes by altering native plant communities and the processes that support them. Some non-native species may cause an increase in fire frequency or increase the available soil nitrogen that allow non-native plants to establish. Many non-native species, such as yellow star thistle (*Centaurea solstitialis*), are able to produce a long tap root that allows them to out-compete the native plants for available water.[117]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)A Yogi Bear sign advising young visitors to not feed the bears at Yosemite National Park.\nThe opening scenes of *Star Trek V: The Final Frontier* (1989) were filmed in Yosemite National Park.

Concessionaires manage nine hotels and lodges, with a total of 2,238 hotel rooms and cabins available. They also oversee gas stations, stores, and most of the campgrounds. Another 800 employees work either permanently or seasonally for the National Park Service.[11]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n173. **^** \"Ranger Programs\". nps.gov.

Berann (1991); scale exaggerated\nThe expansive cultural history of the park has been documented by the 1,000 archeological sites that have been discovered. The park has 1,106 historic structures and features, and of these Obsidian Cliff and five buildings have been designated National Historic Landmarks.[11] Yellowstone was designated an International Biosphere Reserve on October 26, 1976, and a UN World Heritage Site on September 8, 1978. The park was placed on the List of World Heritage in Danger from 1995 to 2003 due to the effects of tourism, infection of wildlife, and issues with invasive species.[70] In 2010, Yellowstone National Park was honored with its own quarter under the America the Beautiful Quarters Program.[71]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHundreds of species of mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians have been documented, including several that are either endangered or threatened.[11] The vast forests and grasslands also include unique species of plants. Yellowstone Park is the largest and most famous megafauna location in the contiguous United States. Grizzly bears, cougars, wolves, and free-ranging herds of bison and elk live in this park. The Yellowstone Park bison herd is the oldest and largest public bison herd in the United States. Forest fires occur in the park each year; in the large forest fires of 1988, nearly one-third of the park was burnt. Yellowstone has numerous recreational opportunities, including hiking, camping, boating, fishing, and sightseeing. Paved roads provide close access to the major geothermal areas as well as some of the lakes and waterfalls. During the winter, visitors often access the park by way of guided tours that use either snow coaches or snowmobiles.[19]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Yellowstone National Park** is a national park located in the western United States, largely in the northwest corner of Wyoming and extending into Montana and Idaho. It was established by the 42nd U.S. Congress with the Yellowstone National Park Protection Act and signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant on March 1, 1872.[6][7][8][9] Yellowstone was the first national park in the U.S. and is also widely held to be the first national park in the world.[10] The park is known for its wildlife and its many geothermal features, especially the Old Faithful geyser, one of its most popular.[11] While it represents many types of biomes, the subalpine forest is the most abundant. It is part of the South Central Rockies forests ecoregion.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n68. **^** Leopold, A. Starker; et al.

Backcountry campsites are accessible only by foot or by horseback and require a permit. There are 1,100 miles (1,800 km) of hiking trails available.[174] The park is not considered to be a good destination for mountaineering because of the instability of volcanic rock which predominates. Visitors with pets are required to keep them on a leash at all times and are limited to areas near roadways and in \"front country\" zones such as drive-in campgrounds.[175] Around thermal features, wooden and paved trails have been constructed to ensure visitor safety, and most of these areas are handicapped accessible.

To accommodate the increased visitation, park officials implemented Mission 66, an effort to modernize and expand park service facilities. Planned to be completed by 1966, in honor of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the National Park Service, Mission 66 construction diverged from the traditional log cabin style with design features of a modern style.[65] During the late 1980s, most construction styles in Yellowstone reverted to the more traditional designs. After the enormous forest fires of 1988 damaged much of Grant Village, structures there were rebuilt in the traditional style. The visitor center at Canyon Village, which opened in 2006, incorporates a more traditional design as well.[66]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n48. **^** Griske, Michael (2005). *The Diaries of John Hunton*.

Management and control of the park originally fell under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of the Interior, the first Secretary of the Interior to supervise the park being Columbus Delano. However, the U.S. Army was eventually commissioned to oversee the management of Yellowstone for 30 years between 1886 and 1916.[13] In 1917, the administration of the park was transferred to the National Park Service, which had been created the previous year. Hundreds of structures have been built and are protected for their architectural and historical significance, and researchers have examined more than a thousand archaeological sites.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n31. **^** Haines, Aubrey L.

The ecosystem is the largest remaining continuous stretch of mostly undeveloped pristine land in the contiguous United States, considered the world's largest intact ecosystem in the northern temperate zone.[18] With the successful wolf reintroduction program, which began in the 1990s, much the original faunal and floral species known to inhabit the region when the first explorers entered the area can be found there.[108][109] The site is home to a key field observation site for the National Ecological Observatory Network.[110]\n\n\n\n### Flora[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Bob Marshall\n* Cabinet Mountains\n* Gates of the Mountains\n* Great Bear\n* Lee Metcalf\n* Medicine Lake\n* Mission Mountains\n* Rattlesnake\n* Red Rock Lakes\n* Scapegoat\n* Selway–Bitterroot\n* UL Bend\n* Welcome Creek\n |\n| National wild and scenic rivers | * East Rosebud Creek\n* Flathead\n* Missouri\n |\n\n |\n| State | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n131. **^** Mott, Maryann (July 2, 2004). \"Bald Eagle, Grizzly: U.S. Icons Endangered No More?\".

The caldera is considered a dormant volcano. It has erupted with tremendous force several times in the last two million years.[14] Well over half of the world's geysers[15][16] and hydrothermal features[17] are in Yellowstone, fueled by this ongoing volcanism. Lava flows and rocks from volcanic eruptions cover most of the land area of Yellowstone. The park is the centerpiece of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the largest remaining nearly intact ecosystem in the Earth's northern temperate zone.[18] In 1978, Yellowstone was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![A large arch made of irregular-shaped natural stone over a road](image)The Roosevelt Arch in Gardiner, Montana, at the north entrance\nThe 1959 Hebgen Lake earthquake just west of Yellowstone at Hebgen Lake damaged roads and some structures in the park. In the northwest section of the park, new geysers were found, and many existing hot springs became turbid.[67] It was the most powerful earthquake to hit the region in recorded history.\n\n\nIn 1963, after several years of public controversy regarding the forced reduction of the elk population in Yellowstone, the United States Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall appointed an advisory board to collect scientific data to inform future wildlife management of the national parks. In a paper known as the Leopold Report, the committee observed that culling programs at other national parks had been ineffective, and recommended the management of Yellowstone's elk population.[68]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nYellowstone National Park has one of the world's largest petrified forests, trees which were long ago buried by ash and soil and transformed from wood to mineral materials. This ash and other volcanic debris are believed to have come from the park area itself as the central part of Yellowstone is the massive caldera of a supervolcano. The park contains 290 waterfalls of at least 15 feet (4.6 m), the highest being the Lower Falls of the Yellowstone River at 308 feet (94 m).[11]\n\n\nThree deep canyons are located in the park, cut through the volcanic tuff of the Yellowstone Plateau by rivers over the last 640,000 years. The Lewis River flows through Lewis Canyon in the south, and the Yellowstone River has carved two colorful canyons, the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone and the Black Canyon of the Yellowstone in its journey north.[78][79][80]\n\n\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Geothermal areas of Yellowstone, Yellowstone Caldera, and Yellowstone hotspot\n\n### Volcanism[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Heritage and Research Center is located at Gardiner, Montana, near the north entrance to the park.[74] The center is home to the Yellowstone National Park's museum collection, archives, research library, historian, archeology lab, and herbarium. The Yellowstone National Park Archives maintain collections of historical records of Yellowstone and the National Park Service. The collection includes the administrative records of Yellowstone, as well as resource management records, records from major projects, and donated manuscripts and personal papers. The archives are affiliated with the National Archives and Records Administration.[75][76]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Mountains and mountain ranges of Yellowstone National Park, Waterfalls in Yellowstone National Park, and Plateaus of Yellowstone National Park\n\n![](image)Official park map c. 2020 (click on map to enlarge)\n![](image)Satellite image of Yellowstone National Park in 2020\n![Map](image)Interactive map of Yellowstone National Park\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFish and Wildlife Service removed the Northern Rocky Mountain wolf population from the endangered species list.[125]\n\n\n\n![](image)Black bear and cub near Tower Fall\nBlack bears are common in the park and were a park symbol due to visitor interaction with the bears starting in 1910. Feeding and close contact with bears has not been permitted since the 1960s to reduce their desire for human foods.[126] Yellowstone is one of the few places in the United States where black bears can be seen coexisting with grizzly bears.[126] Black bear observations occur most often in the park's northern ranges, and in the Bechler area which is in the park's southwestern corner.[127]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n125. **^** \"Final Rule Designating the Northern Rocky Mountain Population of Gray Wolf as a Distinct Population Segment and Removing This Distinct Population Segment From the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife\".

The park contains the tallest active geyser in the world—Steamboat Geyser in the Norris Geyser Basin. A study that was completed in 2011 found that at least 1,283 geysers have erupted in Yellowstone. Of these, an average of 465 are active in a given year.[90][91] Yellowstone contains at least 10,000 geothermal features altogether, including geysers, hot springs, mudpots, and fumaroles.[92] Over half of the world's geysers and hydrothermal features are concentrated in Yellowstone.[93][17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n128. **^** Frank T. van Manen, Mark A.

They were being pursued by the U.S. Army and entered the national park about two weeks after the Battle of the Big Hole. Some of the Nez Perce were friendly to the tourists and other people they encountered in the park; some were not. Nine park visitors were briefly taken captive. Despite Joseph and other chiefs ordering that no one should be harmed, at least two people were killed and several wounded.[54][55] One of the areas where encounters occurred was in Lower Geyser Basin and east along a branch of the Firehole River to Mary Mountain and beyond.[54] That stream is still known as Nez Perce Creek.[56] A group of Bannocks entered the park in 1878, alarming park Superintendent Philetus Norris. In the aftermath of the Sheepeater Indian War of 1879, Norris built a fort to prevent Native Americans from entering the national park.[53][55]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs of 2017[update], an estimated 700 grizzly bears were living in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem,[128] with about 150 grizzlies living wholly or partially within Yellowstone National Park.[129] The grizzly was initially listed as a threatened species in the contiguous United States on July 28, 1975, by the Fish and Wildlife Service. The grizzly bear was taken off the endangered species list in 2007.[130] Opponents of delisting the grizzly expressed concerns that states might once again allow hunting and that better conservation measures were needed to ensure a sustainable population.[131] A federal district judge overturned the delisting ruling in 2009, reinstating the grizzly; however, the grizzly was once again removed from the list in 2017.[130] In September 2018, a U.S. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)American bison\nThe Yellowstone Park bison herd is the largest public herd of American bison in the United States.

Their populations had increased from less than 50 in the park in 1902 to 4,000 by 2003. The Yellowstone Park bison herd reached a peak in 2005 with 4,900 animals. Despite a summer estimated population of 4,700 in 2007, the number dropped to 3,000 in 2008 after a harsh winter and controversial brucellosis management strategies which sent hundreds to slaughter.[120]\n\n\n\n![](image)Elk mother nursing her calf\nThe Yellowstone Park bison herd is believed to be one of only four free-roaming and genetically pure herds on public lands in North America.

The backlog compounds existing problems in environmental management and traffic congestion, as infrastructure to manage traffic flow cannot be built until existing infrastructure is properly maintained. Trail and wilderness restoration is also deferred due to insufficient funding. Additionally, the large number of park entrances creates issues with fee compliance, costing additional lost revenue.[87]\n\n\n\n## Visitor centers[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n65. **^** \"Peregrine falcons return to nest, trails closed to public entry\" (archive). *nps.gov*.

More than 20% of the park is classified as wetland. Marshes and swamps form the transition between terrestrial and aquatic environments, maintaining biodiversity by providing a habitat for a wide range of species. Native wildlife frequent wetlands alongside species that are nesting, overwintering or migrating, such as birds along the Atlantic Flyway.[54] Wetlands are composed of 37.5% marine (sea water), 31.6% palustrine (stagnant water), 20% estuarine (coastal, brackish water), 10.7% lacustrine (freshwater lakes and ponds), and 0.2% riverine (flowing streams). Approximately 53.6 mi (86.3 km) of perennial streams and 47.3 mi (76.1 km) of intermittent streams flow through the park, while about 50 mi (80 km) of shoreline surround 110 lakes and ponds encompassing 1,056.56 acres (427.57 ha; 1.65088 sq mi; 4.2757 km2).[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCongress redesignated the national monument as Lafayette National Park on February 26, 1919,[2] the first American national park east of the Mississippi River[33] and the only one in the Northeastern United States.

The park preserves about half of Mount Desert Island, part of the Isle au Haut, the tip of the Schoodic Peninsula, and portions of 16 smaller outlying islands. It protects the natural beauty of the rocky headlands, including the highest mountains along the Atlantic coast. Acadia boasts a glaciated coastal and island landscape, an abundance of habitats, a high level of biodiversity, clean air and water, and a rich cultural heritage.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSix visitor information centers are located in or near the park, including the main visitor center at Hulls Cove (northwest of Bar Harbor), a nature center at Sieur de Monts (south of Bar Harbor), an information center on Thompson Island (along the roadway to Mount Desert Island), another information center at Village Green in Bar Harbor, a historical museum in Islesford on Little Cranberry Island, and the Rockefeller Welcome Center on the Schoodic Peninsula.

Twenty six significant mountains rise in the park, ranging from 284 ft (87 m) at Flying Mountain's summit to 1,530 ft (470 m) at Cadillac Mountain's summit.[12] Cadillac Mountain, named after the French explorer Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac, is on the eastern side of the island. Cadillac is the tallest mountain along the eastern coastline of the United States.[13] The summit of Cadillac is the first place in the United States where one may watch the sunrise from October 7 through March 6, due to its eastern location and height.[14]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAcadia has a rich human history, dating back more than 10,000 years ago with the Wabanaki people. The 17th century brought fur traders and other European explorers, while the 19th century saw an influx of summer visitors, then wealthy families. Many conservation-minded citizens, among them George B. Dorr (the \"Father of Acadia National Park\"), worked to establish this first U.S. national park east of the Mississippi River and the only one in the Northeastern United States. Acadia was initially designated Sieur de Monts National Monument by proclamation of President Woodrow Wilson in 1916, then renamed and redesignated Lafayette National Park in 1919. The park was renamed Acadia National Park in 1929.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Geologic column for the park region (click image to enlarge)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| State Forests | * Durham\n |\n\n |\n| * *Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry*\n |\n\n| Authority control databases ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n |\n| --- |\n| International | * VIAF\n* WorldCat\n |\n| National | * Germany\n* Israel\n* United States\n\t+ 2\n |\n| Other | * NARA\n* IdRef\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTrees commonly found in the mountains and dry, rocky places of the national park include gray birch, common juniper, jack pine, and pitch pine, while smaller trees, or shrub, species include green alder and pin cherry.

Poverty oatgrass is the most common grass found in mountainous terrain.[55]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nGranite coping stones along carriage road edges act as guard rails; they are nicknamed \"Rockefeller's Teeth.\"[9] The carriage roads are open from the end of the spring mud season, generally in late April, through the summer, autumn, and winter months, until the following spring thaw causes another closure in March to prevent damage to the gravel surface.[39][40]\n\n\nAcadia National Park's first naturalist, Arthur Stupka, also had the distinction of being the first NPS naturalist to serve in any of the NPS's eastern United States districts. He joined the park staff in 1932, and in the capacity of park naturalist he wrote, edited and published a four-volume serial entitled *Nature Notes from Acadia* (1932–1935).[41]\n\n\n\n### Administrative history[edit]\n\n\n#### Superintendents[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Mount Desert Island section of the park harbors more than half of the vascular plant species occurring in Maine.[4] Plant, algal, and fungal specimens collected during research activities at the park are deposited for future study at a herbarium jointly administered by the park and the College of the Atlantic.[58] A special garden called *The Wild Gardens of Acadia* was established in the Sieur de Monts area of the park in 1961 and has since grown to include more than 400 indigenous plant species found throughout all park areas.[59]\n\n\n\n### Fauna[edit]\n\n\nThe park's wide variety of natural habitats provides homes for many different animal species. The coastal location also encourages a large number of species; however, the small size and isolation of these habitats from mainland habitats limits the types of animals, especially their size. Smaller animals are better adapted to smaller habitats which makes them more common and easily observed than larger ones such as black bears and moose.[60]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n86. **^** \"Acadia has a $65M list of maintenance projects, but not enough funds to pay for them\". *Bangor Daily News*.

The seasonal nature of the park means a concentration of visitors in the summer months that is beyond the capacity of park infrastructure. Congestion leads to lack of available parking and gridlock, requiring road closures. Traffic management places a toll on available rangers, competing with rescue operations that also see a sharp increase on peak attendance days.[83]\n\n\nThe Island Explorer bus system is offered in part to reduce congestion; it has served 7.7 million passengers since it began operations in 1999. A portion of park entrance fees partially funds the service.[84]\n\n\n\n### Environmental changes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRecreational activities from spring through autumn include car and bus touring along the park's paved loop road; hiking, bicycling, and horseback riding on carriage roads (motor vehicles are prohibited); fishing; rock climbing; kayaking and canoeing on lakes and ponds; swimming at Sand Beach and Echo Lake; sea kayaking and guided boat tours on the ocean; and various ranger-led programs. Winter activities include cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, snowmobiling, and ice fishing. Two campgrounds are located on Mount Desert Island, another campground is on the Schoodic Peninsula, and five lean-to sites are on Isle au Haut. The main visitor center is at Hulls Cove, northwest of Bar Harbor. Park visitation has been steadily increasing in Acadia over the past decade, with 2021 seeing a record count of 4.07 million visitors.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Tent at Blackwoods Campground\nMount Desert Island has two NPS campgrounds, constructed mainly by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s along with various park trails.[77] Blackwoods Campground is located on the east side of the island, closer to the most popular sites, the carriage roads, and Bar Harbor. Seawall Campground is on the less crowded west side of the island.[22] Schoodic Woods on the Schoodic Peninsula is the newest NPS campground, opened in 2015.[78] Five lean-to shelters are available by advance reservation at Duck Harbor Campground on Isle au Haut.[22] Blackwoods is open throughout the year, though only primitive walk-in camping by permit is possible in winter (December–March), while the others are open from late spring (mid-to-late May) to early autumn (late September to mid-October).[79] Mount Desert Island also has eleven private campgrounds outside park boundaries, while two private campgrounds are on the Schoodic Peninsula, and one is on Isle au Haut.[80]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Mount Desert Island map  \n(click map to enlarge)\nThe park includes mountains, an ocean coastline, woodlands, lakes, and ponds. In addition to nearly half of Mount Desert Island, the park designation also preserves a portion of the Schoodic Peninsula on the mainland, as well as the majority of Isle au Haut and Baker Island, all of Bar Island, three of the four Porcupine Islands (Sheep, Bald and Long), the Thrumcap (an islet), part of Bear Island, and Thompson Island in Mount Desert Narrows, as well as several other islands and islets.[6] Bar Island, which can be visited on foot over a sandbar around low tide,[7] and the Porcupine Islands are in Frenchman Bay by Bar Harbor.[6] About 57 mi (92 km) of carriage roads were designed and financed by John D. Rockefeller Jr. on Mount Desert Island,[8] 45 miles (72 km) of which continue to be maintained inside the park.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAcadia National Park encompasses a total of 49,075 acres (19,860 ha; 76.680 sq mi; 198.60 km2) as of December 31, 2017[update].[1] At least 30,200 acres (12,200 ha; 47.2 sq mi; 122 km2) on Mount Desert Island are included in the park, along with 2,900 acres (1,200 ha; 4.5 sq mi; 12 km2) on Isle au Haut, about 200 acres (81 ha; 0.31 sq mi; 0.81 km2) on smaller islands, and 2,366 acres (957 ha; 3.697 sq mi; 9.57 km2) on the Schoodic Peninsula.[note 1][10][11] As of 2015[update], the permanent park boundary, as established by act of Congress in 1986, included 12,416 acres (5,025 ha; 19.400 sq mi; 50.25 km2) of privately owned land under conservation easements managed by the National Park Service, which plans to acquire the land at some point.[2]\n\n\n\n### Features[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe 27-mile (43 km) Park Loop Road leads to many scenic viewpoints along the coast, through forests and to the top of Cadillac Mountain.[13] The road traverses the eastern side of Mount Desert Island in a one-way, clockwise direction from Bar Harbor to Seal Harbor, passing features such as the Tarn (a pond), Champlain Mountain (location of a popular, exposed cliffside trail named Precipice),[15][16][17] the Beehive (another, smaller mountain), Sand Beach (a saltwater swimming area), Gorham Mountain, Thunder Hole (a crevasse into which waves crash loudly), Otter Cliff, Otter Cove, Seal Harbor, Jordan Pond, Pemetic Mountain, the Bubbles, Bubble Rock, Bubble Pond, Eagle Lake, and the side road to the summit of Cadillac Mountain. Some of the island's west side features include Echo Lake and beach (a designated freshwater swimming area), Acadia Mountain, Beech Mountain, Long Pond, and Seal Cove Pond. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n23. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** Prins, Harald E.

The SERC campus is managed by the nonprofit Schoodic Institute and the NPS in a public-private partnership as one of 19 NPS research learning centers in the country. The center is dedicated to supporting scientific research in the park, providing professional development for teachers, and educating students who will become the next generation of park stewards.[89][90]\n\n\n\n## Friends of Acadia[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nConiferous forest trees include the balsam fir, eastern hemlock, red pine, red spruce, and white spruce.[55] The park has a potential natural vegetation of northeastern spruce/fir within temperate coniferous forests, according to the original A. W. Kuchler types.[56] Spruce-fir forests cover more than sixty percent of the naturally vegetated habitats in the park.[4] Other coniferous forest plants include dewdrop, mountain holly, pinesap, one-flowered pyrola, shinleaf, trailing arbutus, northern woodsorrel, and drooping woodreed.[55]\n\n\nAn invasive insect known as the red pine scale was confirmed on dying red pines on the south side of Norumbega Mountain near Lower Hadlock Pond in 2014.[57]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n32. **^** Dorr, George B.

Dorr, called the \"Father of Acadia National Park\", along with Eliot's father Charles W. Eliot (president of Harvard from 1869 to 1909), supported the idea both through donations of land and through advocacy at the state and federal levels. Dorr later served as the park's first superintendent. President Woodrow Wilson first established its federal status as Sieur de Monts National Monument on July 8, 1916, administered by the National Park Service.[2][31] It was the first national park created from private lands gifted to the public.[4]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFor a select few Americans, the 1880s and the Gay Nineties meant affluence on a scale without precedent. Mount Desert Island, being remote from the cities of the east, became a summer retreat for families such as the Rockefellers, Morgans, Fords, Vanderbilts, Carnegies, and Astors. These families, with the help of developers such as Charles T. How,[29] constructed elegant estates, which they called cottages. Luxury, refinement, and large gatherings replaced the buckboard rides, picnics, and day-long hikes of the rusticators. For more than forty years, the wealthy dominated summer activity on Mount Desert Island, but the Great Depression and World War II brought an end to the extravagance.[28]\n\n\n\n### Park origins[edit]\n\n\n![](image)George B.

To lose by want of action now what will be so precious to the future, whether for the delight of men or as a means to study, would be no less than tragic.\n> \n> — George B. Dorr, 1916, *Acadia National Park: Its Origin and Background* (1942), pp. 53 and 55[32]\n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince the park's founding in 1916, climate change has lengthened the growing season by nearly two months. A longer growing season threatens native plants and invites invasive species that thrive in the longer, warmer summer season. An expanded warm season also lengthens the tourism season, placing further strain on park resources. Changes in rainfall patterns have also taxed park infrastructure, increasing the maintenance required to control erosion and protect the historic carriage roads.[85]\n\n\n\n### Deferred maintenance[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBeginning on October 17, 1947, more than 10,000 acres (4,000 ha; 16 sq mi; 40 km2) of Acadia National Park burned in a fire that also destroyed an additional 7,000 acres (2,800 ha; 11 sq mi; 28 km2) of Mount Desert Island outside the park. The fire began along Crooked Road west of Hulls Cove (northwest of Bar Harbor). The forest fire was one of a series of fires that consumed much of Maine's forest in a dry year. The fire burned until November 14, and was fought by the Coast Guard, Army Air Corps, Navy, local residents, and National Park Service employees from around the country. Sixty-seven of the historic summer cottages along Millionaires’ Row, along with 170 other homes, and five hotels were destroyed. Restoration of the park was substantially supported by the Rockefeller family. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFrom 1915 to 1940, the wealthy philanthropist John D. Rockefeller Jr. financed, designed, and directed the construction of a network of carriage roads throughout the park.[9] He sponsored the landscape architect Beatrix Farrand, whose family owned a summer home in Bar Harbor named Reef Point Estate, to design the planting plans for the carriage roads (c. 1930).[37] The network originally encompassed about 57 miles (92 km)[8] of crushed stone carriage roads with 17 stone-faced, steel-reinforced concrete bridges (16 financed by Rockefeller), and two gate lodges—one at Jordan Pond and the other near Northeast Harbor.[38] About 45 miles (72 km) of carriage roads are maintained and accessible within park boundaries. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Climate data for Acadia National Park, Maine, 1991–2020 normals, extremes 1982–2014\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °F (°C)\n | 57(14)\n | 61(16)\n | 82(28)\n | 85(29)\n | 96(36)\n | 95(35)\n | 96(36)\n | 94(34)\n | 95(35)\n | 83(28)\n | 71(22)\n | 63(17)\n | 96(36)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °F (°C)\n | 32.5(0.3)\n | 34.9(1.6)\n | 41.6(5.3)\n | 53.2(11.8)\n | 64.5(18.1)\n | 73.9(23.3)\n | 79.3(26.3)\n | 78.3(25.7)\n | 70.9(21.6)\n | 58.5(14.7)\n | 47.8(8.8)\n | 37.8(3.2)\n | 56.1(13.4)\n |\n| Daily mean °F (°C)\n | 23.8(−4.6)\n | 26.2(−3.2)\n | 33.3(0.7)\n | 44.0(6.7)\n | 54.7(12.6)\n | 63.9(17.7)\n | 69.7(20.9)\n | 69.0(20.6)\n | 61.9(16.6)\n | 50.6(10.3)\n | 40.3(4.6)\n | 30.1(−1.1)\n | 47.3(8.5)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °F (°C)\n | 15.1(−9.4)\n | 17.5(−8.1)\n | 25.0(−3.9)\n | 34.8(1.6)\n | 44.8(7.1)\n | 53.8(12.1)\n | 60.2(15.7)\n | 59.7(15.4)\n | 52.8(11.6)\n | 42.8(6.0)\n | 32.7(0.4)\n | 22.4(−5.3)\n | 38.5(3.6)\n |\n| Record low °F (°C)\n | −21(−29)\n | −18(−28)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ HAER No. ME-15, \"Blackwoods Bridge, Spanning Park Loop Road at Route 3 near Blackwoods, Otter Creek\", 2 photos, 4 data pages, 1 photo caption page\n\t+ HAER No. ME-16, \"Fish House Bridge, Spanning Fish House Access Road at Park Loop Road, Otter Creek\", 3 photos, 5 data pages, 1 photo caption page\n\t+ HAER No. ME-17, \"Route 233 Bridge, Spanning Route 233 on Paradise Hill Road, Bar Harbor\", 2 photos, 6 data pages, 1 photo caption page\n\t+ HAER No. ME-18, \"New Eagle Lake Road Bridge, Spanning New Eagle Lake Road on Paradise Hill Road, Bar Harbor\", 3 photos, 6 data pages, 1 photo caption page\n\t+ HAER No. ME-19, \"Otter Creek Cove Bridge and Causeway, Spanning Otter Creek Cove on Park Loop Road, Seal Harbor\", 6 photos, 3 color transparencies, 1 measured drawing, 17 data pages, 1 photo caption page\n\t+ HAER No. ME-20, \"Kebo Brook Bridge, Spanning Kebo Brook on Park Loop Road, Bar Harbor\", 4 data pages\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Cross-country skier on a carriage road\nMotor vehicle touring along the 27-mile (43 km) Park Loop Road begins on April 15, if weather permits, and ends on December 1, unless significant snowfall closes it sooner.

Stunted, gnarled trees also survive near the summits. Spruce-fir boreal forests cover much of the park. Stands of oak, maple, beech, and other hardwoods more typical of New England represent the eastern deciduous forest. Pitch pines and scrub oaks inhabit isolated forests at their northeastern range limit, while jack pines reach the southern limit of their range in Acadia.[54]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt least twelve sea caves are located in several coastal areas of the park. Sea caves are formed when waves cause erosion of coastal rock formations. If a sea cave is enlarged enough, it may break through a headland to form a sea arch.[53]\n\n\n\n### Mass wasting and slope failure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rockfall along the loop road\nFrequent thawing in winter prevents large accumulations of snow, and keeps the ground well saturated. Ice storms are common in winter and early spring, while rain occurs throughout the year. Saturated soils, thawing, and heavy precipitation lead to rockfalls every spring along Mount Desert Island's loop road, as well as slumping along coastal bluffs.[53]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Humpback whale breaching\nMany marine species may be observed in the surrounding waters, including seals and whales, from a sea kayak or other personal watercraft, or on ranger-narrated boat cruises.

Subsequent projects and partnerships included Acadia Trails Forever, the first endowed trail system in an American national park with $13 million raised between 1999 and 2001, and the Island Explorer, a free, propane-powered bus system serving the park and local communities since 1999.[92]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ HAER No. ME-21, \"Little Hunters Beach Brook Bridge, Spanning Little Hunters Beach Brook on Park Loop Road, Seal Harbor\", 1 photo, 4 data pages, 1 photo caption page\n\t+ HAER No. ME-22, \"Hunters Beach Brook Bridge, Spanning Hunters Beach Brook on Park Loop Road, Seal Harbor\", 2 photos, 4 data pages, 1 photo caption page\n\t+ HAER No. ME-23, \"Frazer Creek Bridge, Spanning Frazer Creek on Schoodic Peninsula Road, Winter Harbor\", 1 photo, 1 photo caption page\n\t+ HAER No. ME-30, \"Duck Brook Bridge, Spanning Duck Brook on Paradise Hill Road, Bar Harbor\", 4 photos, 1 color transparency, 1 measured drawing, 7 data pages, 1 photo caption page\n\t+ HAER No. ME-47, \"Wildwood Farm Bridge, Spanning Abandoned Road on Park Loop Road, Seal Harbor\", 2 photos, 4 data pages, 1 photo caption page\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | −11(−24)\n | 8(−13)\n | 24(−4)\n | 32(0)\n | 36(2)\n | 35(2)\n | 31(−1)\n | 16(−9)\n | 3(−16)\n | −13(−25)\n | −21(−29)\n |\n| Average precipitation inches (mm)\n | 4.48(114)\n | 3.84(98)\n | 4.94(125)\n | 5.15(131)\n | 4.50(114)\n | 4.28(109)\n | 3.27(83)\n | 3.45(88)\n | 4.22(107)\n | 5.86(149)\n | 5.89(150)\n | 5.66(144)\n | 55.54(1,411)\n |\n| Average snowfall inches (cm)\n | 17.0(43)\n | 16.8(43)\n | 15.5(39)\n | 4.7(12)\n | trace\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.2(0.51)\n | 3.0(7.6)\n | 14.6(37)\n | 71.8(182.11)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.01 in) | 12.1\n | 9.8\n | 12.2\n | 11.6\n | 13.5\n | 12.1\n | 10.8\n | 9.3\n | 10.7\n | 11.5\n | 11.4\n | 13.7\n | 138.7\n |\n| Average snowy days (≥ 0.1 in) | 6.3\n | 5.3\n | 4.5\n | 1.2\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 1.2\n | 4.5\n | 23.0\n |\n| Source 1: NOAA (snow/snow days 1981–2010)[48][49] |\n| Source 2: XMACIS2[50] |\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Frozen lake and snowy trees\nThe region is characterized by a large seasonal variation in temperature with warm to hot summers that are often humid, and cold to severely cold winters. According to the Köppen climate classification system, Mount Desert Island has a warm-summer humid continental climate (*Dfb*). The average annual temperature in the park is 47.3 °F (8.5 °C). July is the warmest month with an average of 69.7 °F (20.9 °C), while January is the coldest month with an average of 23.8 °F (−4.6 °C). The record high and low temperatures are 96 °F (36 °C) and -21 °F (−29 °C), respectively. The plant hardiness zone is 5b with an average annual extreme minimum air temperature of −11.4 °F (−24.1 °C).[47]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe name of the park was changed to Acadia National Park on January 19, 1929, in honor of the former French colony of Acadia which once included Maine.[2] In 1929 Schoodic Peninsula was donated to Acadia by John Godfrey Moore's second wife Louise and daughters Ruth and Faith. Keeping up with the taxes on the Schoodic land became a drain on the family finances and they thought this world be a fitting way to honor John Godfrey Moore. There was an unspoken stipulation in the discussions — the heirs were anglophiles that did not want to have their land as part of Lafayette National Park. Conservationist George Dorr, who is referred to as the \"Father of Acadia National Park\", suggested the name Acadia, and the deal went through after the name changed, ensuring the expansion.[35][36]\n\n\n\n![](image)Carriage road with \"Rockefeller's Teeth\" (granite coping stones).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Mount Desert Island from Baker Island\nThe border established between the United States and Canada after the American Revolution split the Wabanaki homelands. The confederacy was dissolved around 1870 due to pressure from the American and Canadian governments, though the tribal nations continued to interact in their traditional ways.[23] In the nineteenth century, Wabanakis sold handmade ash and birch bark baskets to travelers. The Wabanaki performed dances for summer tourists and residents at Sieur de Monts and the town of Bar Harbor. Wabanaki guides led canoe trips around Frenchman Bay and the Cranberry Islands.[21]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNative Americans have inhabited the area called Acadia for at least 12,000 years, including the coastal areas of Maine, Canada, and adjacent islands. The Wabanaki Confederacy (\"People of the Dawnland\") consists of five related Algonquian nations—the Maliseet, Mi'kmaq, Passamaquoddy, Abenaki and Penobscot. Some of the nations call Mount Desert Island *Pemetic* (\"range of mountains\"), which has remained at the center of the Wabanaki traditional ancestral homeland and territory of traditional stewardship responsibility to the present day.[21] The etymology of the park's name begins with the Mi'kmaq term *akadie* (\"piece of land\") which was rendered as *l'Acadie* by French explorers, and translated into English as Acadia.[22]\n\n\nThe Wabanaki traveled to the island in birch bark canoes to hunt, fish, gather berries, harvest clams and basket-making resources like sweetgrass, and to trade with other Wabanakis. They camped near places like Somes Sound.[21]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_pIxLHIN2U5Ut87WTUfzHWYan","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Eight national parks (including six in Alaska) are paired with a national preserve, areas with different levels of protection that are administered together but considered separate units and whose areas are not included in the figures below. The 429 units of the National Park System can be broadly referred to as national parks, but most have other formal designations.[4]\n\n\nA bill creating the first national park, Yellowstone, was signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant in 1872, followed by Mackinac National Park in 1875 (decommissioned in 1895), and then Rock Creek Park (later merged into National Capital Parks), Sequoia and Yosemite in 1890. The Organic Act of 1916 created the National Park Service \"to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and wildlife therein, and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.\"[5] Many current national parks had been previously protected as national monuments by the president under the Antiquities Act or as other designations created by Congress before being redesignated by Congress; the newest national park is New River Gorge, previously a National River, and the most recent entirely new park is National Park of American Samoa. A few former national parks are no longer designated as such, or have been disbanded. Fourteen national parks are designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites (WHS),[6] and 21 national parks are named UNESCO Biosphere Reserves (BR),[7] with eight national parks in both programs.\n\n\nThirty states have national parks, as do the territories of American Samoa and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The state with the most national parks is California with nine, followed by Alaska with eight, Utah with five, and Colorado with four. The largest national park is Wrangell–St. Elias in Alaska: at over 8 million acres (32,375 km2), it is larger than each of the nine smallest states. The next three largest parks are also in Alaska. The smallest park is Gateway Arch National Park, Missouri, at 192.83 acres (0.7804 km2). The total area protected by national parks is approximately 52.4 million acres (212,000 km2), for an average of 833 thousand acres (3,370 km2) but a median of only 220 thousand acres (890 km2).[8]\n\n\nThe national parks set a visitation record in 2021, with more than 92 million visitors.[9] Great Smoky Mountains National Park in North Carolina and Tennessee has been the most-visited park since 1944,[10] and had almost 13 million visitors in 2022.[11] In contrast, only about 9,500 people visited the remote Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve in Alaska in 2022.[11]\n\n\n\n\n## National parks[edit]\n\n\n\n**Map all coordinates using** OpenStreetMap\n**Download coordinates as:**\n\n\n\n* KML\n* GPX (all coordinates)\n* GPX (primary coordinates)\n* GPX (secondary coordinates)\n\nLegend\n\\* Green – UNESCO designated World Heritage Sites (WHS)\n\n† Blue – UNESCO designated Biosphere Reserves (BR)\n\n‡ Purple – parks designated in both UNESCO programs\n\n\n\nList of U.S. national parks\n| Name\n | Image\n | Location\n | Date established as park[12] | Area (2023)[8] | Recreation visitors (2022)[11] | Description\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Acadia | ![A white lighthouse](image) | Maine44°21′N 68°13′W﻿ / ﻿44.35°N 68.21°W﻿ / 44.35; -68.21﻿ (Acadia) | February 26, 1919 | 49,071.40 acres (198.6 km2)\n | 3,970,260\n | Covering most of Mount Desert Island and other coastal islands, Acadia features the tallest mountain on the Atlantic coast of the United States, granite peaks, ocean shoreline, woodlands, and lakes.
