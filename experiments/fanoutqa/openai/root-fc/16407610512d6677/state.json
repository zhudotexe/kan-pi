Having first joined the company as a summer associate in high school, he became the company's fifth CEO in 2014. He previously led the company's Sam's Club division, from 2005 to 2009, and Walmart International, from 2009 to 2013.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nMcMillon was born in Memphis, Tennessee,[2] and grew up in Jonesboro, Arkansas,[3] the eldest of three children born to Laura and Morris McMillon, a dentist who served in Vietnam.[4] His parents moved the family to Bentonville, Arkansas, the home of Walmart headquarters, when McMillon was 16.[4] A sports enthusiast, McMillon played point guard on the Bentonville High School basketball team.[4]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nMcMillon has worked for Walmart throughout his career.[5] He took on his first role with the company as a teenager in 1984.[4][5] He later became a buyer, then moved into management roles before becoming CEO in 2014.[3][5]\n\n\n\n### Early career[edit]\n\n\nWhen he was a teenager, McMillon began his first job with Walmart as a summer associate. He worked during the summer[4] unloading trucks in a distribution center. After high school, McMillon attended University of Arkansas, where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1989.[6]\n\n\nThe next year, as McMillon studied for a Master of Business Administration (MBA) from University of Tulsa, he called Walmart and told an executive he was interested in training to become a buyer when he completed his studies.[4] Soon thereafter, McMillon rejoined Walmart as an assistant manager at a Tulsa, Oklahoma, store.[4] After completing his MBA in 1991,[6] McMillon moved to Walmart's Bentonville headquarters to join the buyer-training program.[7][8] Originally in charge of buying fishing tackle,[4] he later took on various roles as a buyer and a merchandiser, dealing in food, clothes, crafts and furnishings.[9] He later worked as a general merchandise manager for Walmart's wholesale store division Sam's Club before taking an executive role at Walmart, overseeing toys, electronics, and sporting goods, among other areas.[9]\n\n\n\n### Sam's Club (2005\u20132009)[edit]\n\n\nWalmart promoted McMillon to president and CEO of Sam's Club on August 4, 2005.[7][10] Under McMillon, the wholesaler emphasized marketing to small business customers.[3] Additionally, McMillon incorporated what *The Wall Street Journal* called \"treasure hunt\" items that are limited-selection expensive premium items, such as diamond necklaces and wine vacations, for sale next to cheap bulk goods in an attempt to compete with Costco.[3]\n\n\n\n### Walmart International (2009\u20132013)[edit]\n\n\nWalmart officials moved McMillon from his role at Sam's Club to lead Walmart's international division in February 2009,[11] replacing Mike Duke, who was promoted to CEO of Walmart Stores, Inc.[9] Under McMillon, Walmart International focused on improving in existing markets, such as Canada, China, United Kingdom and the Americas.[12] One area of particular importance to McMillon was integrating Walmart's \"everyday low prices\" model to these international markets.[12] Under McMillon, the international division acquired a majority stake in South Africa's Massmart Holdings Ltd. for US$2.4\u00a0billion.[4][13]\n\n\nDuring McMillon's tenure, Walmart International's sales growth outpaced Walmart US[14] and grew to 29 percent of total sales company-wide.[9] When McMillon first became head of the division, it comprised more than 3,300 stores in 14 countries.[15] When Walmart announced it would move him to head Walmart Stores, Inc. in late 2013, Walmart International operated 6,300 stores in 26 countries.[16][*failed verification*]\n\n\n\n### CEO of Walmart, Inc. (2014\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)McMillon speaks from the White House Rose Garden on the COVID-19 pandemic in April 2020\nWalmart announced on November 25, 2013, that McMillon would immediately join the company's board of directors,[17] and would replace Mike Duke as Walmart CEO effective on February 1, 2014, becoming the company's fifth chief executive.[4]\n\n\nMcMillon took over the company at a time of slowing growth and increased competition from rivals, such as Costco, Amazon.com, grocery store chains Kroger and Safeway, and discount chains of small stores like Family Dollar and Dollar General.[4] Within his first two years as chief executive, McMillon raised wages for hourly workers in the US, boosted the company's commitment to e-commerce and revamped Walmart's executive team. While increased spending on labor and Walmart's digital offerings lowered short-term profits, McMillon argued that the moves would lead to happier workers and better customer service,[18] as well as a better footing in a changing retail market.[19]\n\n\nIn February 2015, McMillon announced Walmart would invest an additional US$2.7\u00a0billion in higher associate wages, benefits and training, including raising its lowest wage to US$9 an hour in 2015 and US$10 an hour for 2016.[20][21] The action affected 40 percent of the company's 1.4\u00a0million US workers.[22] In January 2016, McMillon announced raises for the majority of its workers, free basic short-term disability for full-time workers and a revised paid time off program.[18]\n\n\nMcMillon made it a long-term goal of Walmart to increase investments in e-commerce, stressing a need to create a \"seamless shopping experience\".[23] As such he announced in 2015 that Walmart would invest US$1\u00a0billion on its online operations.[24] Another goal is to improve the company's environmental sustainability and eliminate waste across the company.[25] In 2014, Walmart began rolling out an initiative to replace lighting in its stores in the US, UK, Latin America and Asia with LED lights for energy efficiency.[26] At the Davos World Economic Forum in January 2016, McMillon said Walmart would press three of its main goals: supply the company with renewable energy, eliminate waste and promote sustainably packaged goods.[27]\n\n\nAs CEO, McMillon sought to make a \"positive difference\" in other issues.[25] On March 31, 2015, McMillon issued a statement urging Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson to veto the state's \"religious freedom\" bill.[28] McMillon said the bill \"threatens to undermine the spirit of inclusion present throughout the state of Arkansas and does not reflect the values we proudly uphold\".[28]\n\n\nIn June 2015, McMillon said the company would stop selling Confederate flag merchandise[21] following the shooting of nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina.[29] McMillon altered Walmart's gun sales. He told *CNNMoney* in an interview that Walmart's selection of firearms should be geared towards hunters and sports shooters.[30] In August 2015, the company ceased sales of military-style semiautomatic weapons.[30]\n\n\n*Forbes* named McMillon to its World's Most Powerful People list in 2014, 2015 and 2016 where he ranked No.\u00a029, No.\u00a032, No.\u00a027 respectively.[31] ExecRank ranked McMillon No.\u00a04 on its 2015 list of top CEOs for large companies.[32]\n\n\nIn December 2016, McMillon joined a business forum assembled by then president-elect Donald Trump to provide strategic and policy advice on economic issues.[33] In August 2017, McMillon wrote a rebuke of President Trump's response to the violent protests Charlottesville, Virginia in an email to all employees and on the internal company website that is viewable by the public. The statement said the President, \"missed a critical opportunity to help bring our country together\". A company spokesman said McMillon would continue to serve on a presidential advisory council on economic development.[34]\n\n\nIn September 2019, McMillion announced that the company would no longer sell ammunition used for handguns and military-style weapons. This policy update came as a result of the mass shooting which took place at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas in August 2019. McMillion's actions to create a dialogue and take actions around the issue, set a new precedent for how corporations and their leaders address these matters.[35]\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nMcMillon lives with his wife, Shelley, in Bentonville, Arkansas.[19] They have two sons.[6] Doug McMillon is a born-again Christian.[36]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Walmart Executive Management\".

Jassy** (born January 13, 1968)[5][6] is an American business executive who is the president and chief executive officer (CEO) of Amazon. Before being appointed by Jeff Bezos and the Amazon board during the fourth quarter of 2020,[7][8] Jassy served as the SVP and later as the CEO of Amazon Web Services from 2003 to 2021.[9]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nJassy is the son of Margery and Everett L. Jassy of Scarsdale, New York.[3] Jewish[10][11] with Hungarian ancestry,[10] his father was a senior partner in the corporate law firm Dewey Ballantine in New York City, and chairman of the firm's management committee.[3] Jassy grew up in Scarsdale, and attended Scarsdale High School,[3][12] where he played varsity soccer and tennis.[13]\n\n\nJassy graduated cum laude from Harvard College in government, where he was advertising manager of *The Harvard Crimson*, before earning an MBA from Harvard Business School. In 1989, he wrote in *The Crimson* that the newspaper should continue to publish advertisements from Eastern Air Lines, despite an ongoing labor dispute there.[14][15][16]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nJassy worked for five years after graduation before entering his MBA program as a project manager for a collectibles company, MBI, and then he and an MBI colleague started a company and closed it down.[15][17]\n\n\nJassy joined Amazon as a marketing manager in 1997[13] with several other Harvard MBA colleagues.[17][15] In 2003, he and Jeff Bezos came up with the idea to create the cloud computing platform that became known as Amazon Web Services, which launched in 2006.[18] Jassy headed it and its team of 57 people.[1]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jassy in 2016\nIn 2016, Jassy was named Person of the Year by the *Financial Times*.[15] A month later, Jassy was promoted from senior vice president to chief executive officer of Amazon Web Services.[19][16] That year Jassy earned $36.6 million.[20]\n\n\nFor his work as chief executive officer of Amazon Web Services, Jassy earned a base compensation of $175,000 in 2020, plus a restricted stock unit award of 4,023 shares (a value of $12,104,844.93 as of July 26, 2020[21]) of Amazon with vesting beginning in 2023. He also received a restricted stock unit award in April 2018 for 10,000 shares (a value of $30,089,100 as of July 26, 2020),[21] which vest 37.5% in 2021, 12.5% in 2022, 37.5% in 2023, and 12.5% in 2024.[22]\n\n\nIn January 2021, Bezos designated Jassy his official successor as CEO;[23] with the transition occurring on July 5, 2021.[24] As CEO of Amazon, Jassy received a ten year pay package totaling $212.7 million. The majority of the compensation package is in stock and vests over 10 years.[25]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn 1997, Jassy married Elana Rochelle Caplan, a fashion designer for Eddie Bauer and graduate of the Philadelphia College of Textiles and Science, at a Loews Hotel in Santa Monica, California.[3] Their wedding was officiated by New York Rabbi James Brandt, a cousin of Elana.[26] Both their fathers were senior partners in law firm Dewey Ballantine.[3] Jassy and Caplan have two children.[4]\n\n\nThey live in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle in a 10,000-square-foot house bought in 2009 for $3.1 million.[2][27] In October 2020, it was reported that Jassy had bought a $6.7 million 5,500-square-foot house in Santa Monica.[28][29][27]\n\n\nHe is chairman of Rainier Prep, a charter school in Seattle.[30]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** McLaughlin, Kevin (August 4, 2015). \"Andy Jassy: Amazon's $6 Billion Man\".

It is the largest utility company in the world. As of 2022[update], State Grid is the world's third largest company overall by revenue, behind Walmart and Saudi Aramco.[5] In 2022 it was reported as having 871,145 employees, 1.1 billion customers and revenue equivalent to US$460 billion. It is overseen by the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council.\n\n\nAfter the electricity Plant-Grid Separation reform in early 2002, the assets of State Electric Power Corporation (\u56fd\u5bb6\u7535\u529b\u516c\u53f8) were divided into five power generation groups that retained the power plants and five regional subsidiaries belonging to the State Grid Corporation of China in Beijing.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nChina began an initiative to reform the country's power sector in a three-stage process in 1986.[7] In the third and final stage in March 2002 the State Council of the People's Republic of China put into effect a plan to restructure the country's electric power system in order to create competition and separate generation and transmission functions.[8] The State Grid Corporation of China was founded on December 29, 2002, when the restructuring divided the former State Power Corporation of China into two grid companies, five generation groups and four accessorial business companies.[9] The two grid companies created were the State Grid Corporation of China and a smaller China Southern Power Grid Company.[10] SGCC accounts for 80% of the Chinese grid, with China Southern Power Grid accounting for the other 20%.[11]:\u200a40 At its creation, SGCC company had a generation capacity of 6.47 gigawatts.[8]\n\n\nIn 2003 and progressively so through the early 2000s, electrical shortages caused the government to institute rolling blackouts. The State Grid Corporation estimated there were 1 trillion yuan in losses from 2002 to 2005.[8] The State Grid Corporation of China ran the first 1,000-kilovolt alternating current power line between Northern Shanxi and center Hubei in January 2009. In 2012 it began operation of an 800-kilovolt direct current line that sends hydropower from western Sichuan to Shanghai. It also has an alternating current loop line in the Yangtze River delta, and three longitudinal alternating current lines that bring power to Southern China from the Northern region.[12]\n\n\nThe State Grid Corporation was involved in a multi-phase smart-grid project for China's electrical grid planned for 2011\u20132015.[13] China's smart grid efforts are different from those in the United States in that its plans heavily use ultra high voltage (UHV) lines. Several UHV construction projects began in 2012 to bring UHV power lines across Huainan, Wannan, and Shanghai and another from Xilingol League to Nanjing. By 2015, the company planned to have three more horizontal UHV lines through West Inner Mongolia to Weifang, from Central Shanxi\u2013Xuzhou to Yaan\u2013southern Anhui and 11 other lines by 2015.[12]\n\n\nIn 2012 the company invested in CDP Reti.\n\n\nFrom 2010 to 2020 the companies investments in grid expansion rose from 291.12 BioYuan to 460.5 BioYuan.[14]\n\n\n\n## Controversy[edit]\n\n\nOn October 29, 2014, The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection declared that the general manager of State Grid Shanghai Municipal Electric Power, Feng Jun, was detained in an anti-graft operation overseen by the commission.[15] In 2017, his assets (worth 53 million yuan) were seized, and he was sentenced to life in prison.[16]\n\n\n\n## Overseas investments[edit]\n\n\n### Philippines[edit]\n\n\nOn December 12, 2007, two consortia bid for a 25-year license to run the Philippines power grid\u2014privatization of the management of the Philippine government-owned National Transmission Corporation (TransCo), the consortium of Monte Oro Grid Resources Corp., led by businessman Enrique Razon, comprising the State Grid Corporation of China, and Calaca High Power Corp., won an auction conducted by the Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management (PSALM) Corp. as it submitted the highest offer of $3.95 billion, for the right to operate TransCo for 25 years, outbidding San Miguel Energy, a unit of the Filipino San Miguel Corporation (bid of $3.905 billion), Dutch firm TPG Aurora BV, and Malaysia's TNB Prai Sdn Bhd.[17][18][19] This initiated the privatization process for the transmission sector. The resulting consortium became the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP).[20]\n\n\nOn February 21, 2008, NGCP was registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\n\nOn February 28, 2008, TransCo's concession agreement with NGCP was executed and became effective. The agreement between NGCP and TransCo was signed by TransCo president Arthur Aguilar, PSALM president Jose Ibazeta, and NGCP directors Walter Brown, Elmer Pedregosa and Du Zhigang.[21][22] In November of that same year, Congress approved bicameral resolution granting franchise to NGCP to manage and operate its transmission facilities nationwide. President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo signed Republic Act 9511 which granted NGCP to operate and manage the country's power grid in December 2008.\n\n\nOn January 15, 2009, TransCo turned over the operations, maintenance, and management of the transmission system to NGCP which marked the start of the 25-year concession period and franchise and renewable for another 25 years with a total of 50 years, which privatized the operations and maintenance of the Philippine power grid and its related assets and facilities and turned over from the Philippine government to the private sector. The franchise and concession period will end on December 1, 2058.[23][24][25]\n\n\n\n### Other countries[edit]\n\n\nIn Portugal, State Grid has a 25% stake in REN since the second stage of its privatization (in 2012\u20132014).[26]\n\n\nIn Australia, State Grid owns a 41% stake in ElectraNet, a 19.9% stake in AusNet Services, and 60% stake in Jemena.[27]\n\n\nIn Brazil, State Grid is involved in developing, building, and operating hydropower facilities.[11]:\u200a207 State Grid acquired the control of CPFL Energia S.A. for the equivalent of US$3.4 billion in 2017.[28] State Grid built the 2000\u00a0km Ultra High Voltage power line delivering hydropower to the megacities Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo.[29]\n\n\nIn Chile, State Grid acquired Chilquinta Energ\u00eda, the third-largest distributor of electricity in Chile, and Tecnored SA, which provides construction services to Chilquinta, from U.S. power company Sempra Energy. The deal was closed on June 24, 2020.[30] On 13 November 2020, it was announced that State Grid had reached an agreement to acquire Compa\u00f1ia General de Electricidad (CGE), the largest distribution of electricity in this country.[31]\n\n\n\n## Subsidiaries[edit]\n\n\n* State Grid Yingda Group\n\t+ Yingda International Trust (89.76%)\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Energy portal\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n\n\n* China Southern Power Grid\n* China Datang Corporation\n* List of companies of China\n* Smart grid\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"State Grid's 2017 financial report\".

Its headquarters are in Dongcheng District, Beijing.[4] CNPC was ranked fourth in 2022 Fortune Global 500, a global ranking of the largest corporations by revenue.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Corporate structure[edit]\n\n\nCNPC is the government-owned parent company of publicly listed PetroChina, which was created on November 5, 1999, as part of the restructuring of CNPC. In the restructuring, CNPC injected into PetroChina most of the assets and liabilities of CNPC relating to its hydrocarbon exploration and production, refining and marketing, chemicals and natural gas businesses. CNPC and PetroChina develop overseas assets through a joint venture, the CNPC Exploration & Development Company (CNODC), which is 50% owned by PetroChina.\n\n\nIn March 2014, CNPC Chairman Zhou Jiping announced that CNPC would be opening six business units to private investors.[6]\n\n\nCNPC also has a memorandum of understanding with UOP Llc, under which the two companies will collaborate on a range of biofuels technologies and projects in China.[7]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nUnlike the Chinese Petroleum Corporation (CPC Corporation), which was relocated to Taiwan with the retreat of the Republic of China following the communist revolution in 1949, CNPC can be traced from the beginning as a governmental department of the Government of the People's Republic of China. In 1949, the Chinese government formed a 'Fuel Industry Ministry' dedicated to the management of fuel. In January 1952 a division of the fuel ministry was formed to manage petroleum exploration and mining, called the 'Chief Petroleum Administration Bureau'. In July 1955 a new ministry was created to replace the Fuel Industry Ministry, called the Ministry of Petroleum. From 1955 to 1969, approximately 4 oil fields were found in 4 areas in Qinghai, Heilongjiang (Daqing oilfield), Bohai Bay and Songliao basin. CNPC was created on 17 September 1988, when the government decided to create a state-owned company to handle all Petroleum activities in China and disbanded the Ministry of Petroleum.[8][9]\n\n\nCNPC's international operations began in 1993. The CNPC subsidiary SAPET signed a service contract with the government of Peru to operate Block VII in the Talara Province basin.[10] This was followed by an oil contract with the government of Sudan \"In June 1997, the Greater Nile Petroleum Operating Company was established with the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) taking 40 percent ownership\".[11] \nIn August 2005 it was announced that CNPC agreed to buy the Alberta-based PetroKazakhstan for US$4.18 billion, then the largest overseas acquisition by a Chinese company. The acquisition went through on 26 October 2005 after a Canadian court turned down an attempt by LUKoil to block the sale.[12] In 2006 67% of shares were sold from the parent company to PetroChina[13]\nIn June 1997, the company bought a 60.3% stake in the Aktobe Oil Company of Kazakhstan, and in July 1997 CNPC won an oil contract for the Intercampo oilfield and East Caracoles oilfield in Venezuela.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn July 1998, the government restructured the company in accordance with the upstream and downstream principle of the oil industry.[14] and CNPC spun off most of its domestic assets into a separate company, PetroChina. On 5 November 2007, HK listed PetroChina was listed as an A-share in the Shanghai Stock Exchange.[15]\n\n\nIn 2012, a CNPC subsidiary, the Bank of Kunlun, was sanctioned because of its financial relationship with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the Quds Force.[16]\n\n\nIn July 2013, CNPC and Eni signed a $4.2 billion deal to acquire a 20% stake in a Mozambique offshore natural gas block.[17]\n\n\nIn June 2014, the \"head of a key China National Petroleum subsidiary was recalled to Beijing\" and fell \"from public view\".[18] Replacement of China National Petroleum's top representative in Canada was announced in July.[18]\n\n\n\n## Operations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fuel prices at a PetroChina petrol station in Dalian, Liaoning, China, 2009\nCNPC holds proven reserves of 3.7 billion barrels (590,000,000\u00a0m3) of oil equivalent. In 2007, CNPC produced 54 billion cubic metres of natural gas.[19] CNPC has 30 international exploration and production projects with operations in Azerbaijan, Canada, Iran, Indonesia, Myanmar, Oman, Peru, Sudan, Niger, Thailand, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela. Many of the company's exploration projects are carried out by the Great Wall Drilling Company (GWDC), a wholly owned drilling services company.[20]\n\n\nIn 2018 the company announced it is building natural gas storage facilities with a total capacity of 55.6 billion cu m in the northern Henan province, to ease supply bottlenecks in the peak winter season. China has accelerated the construction of underground gas storage facilities due to the challenges faced in transporting gas last winter when logistical issues forced buyers to truck LNG thousands of kilometers from import terminals to consumption areas. The country has started an ambitious program to convert large numbers of coal-fired boilers to cleaner natural gas, to curb smog and pollution.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Africa[edit]\n\n\nCNPC was the first Chinese enterprise to invest in Africa.[21]:\u200a165 In 1996, it began developing oil fields previously discovered by Chevron in Sudan, but which Chevron had abandoned due to civil conflict in Sudan.[21]:\u200a165\n\n\n\n#### South Sudan[edit]\n\n\nAfter South Sudan's independence in 2011, South Sudan's territory included many of the Sudanese oil fields where CNPC (as well as Sinopec) have significant interests.[21]:\u200a165 CNPC is a major investor in South Sudan's oil sector. The company is major stockholder in Petrodar consortiums.[22]\n\n\nThe Great Wall Drilling Company, a subsidiary of the China National Petroleum Company, invested $700 million in drilling 57 wells in Sudan over a 3-year period starting in 1997.[23] In 2010, the company was awarded a contract by the Sudanese Petroleum Ministry to build 5 oil rigs for $75.5 million.[24]\n\n\n\n#### Chad[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2023, CNPC operates oil fields in Chad with a Swiss company.[21]:\u200a165\n\n\n\n#### Mozambique[edit]\n\n\nIn Mozambique, CNPC owns 20% of two natural gas projects as of 2023.[21]:\u200a165\n\n\n\n#### Niger[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2023, CNPC in a joint project with Niger's central government runs a refinery.[21]:\u200a165 CNPC also runs the country's only operational oil field.[21]:\u200a165\n\n\n\n### Central Asia[edit]\n\n\n#### Afghanistan[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2011, Afghanistan signed a deal with CNPC for the development of oil blocks in the Amu Darya basin, a project expected to earn billions of dollars over two decades; the deal covers drilling and a refinery in the northern provinces of Sar-e Pol and Faryab and is the first international oil production agreement entered into by the Afghan government for several decades.[25] All CNPC operations were shut down in Afghanistan due to the Taliban takeover.\n\n\n\n#### Kazakhstan[edit]\n\n\nCNPC is one of the most active Chinese companies in the petroleum sector in Kazakhstan.[26] It is heavily involved in the development of Kazakh oil after the acquisition of Alberta-based PetroKazakhstan, a company with all operations in Kazakhstan. The company was purchased for $4.18 billion. Political resistance in Kazakhstan to the deal was placated by the sale of a minority stake in PetroKazakhstan by CNPC to KazMunaiGaz, the Kazakh state-owned oil company.\n\n\nIn June 2023, CNPC received full support from Samruk-Kazyna for investments in the expansion of Kazakhstan's gas and oil pipeline capacities, as well as the construction of a sour gas processing plant to be located at the Kashagan offshore development site. In addition, CNPC was involved in the upgrade projects at the Shymkent oil refinery. Through the implementation of these projects, China will be able to receive oil produced and then diverted from Kazakhstan.[27] The modernisation of the oil refinery in Shymkent was completed in August 2023.[28]\n\n\n**Pakistan**\n\n\nGreat Wall Drilling Corporations (GWDC) was operating in Pakistan until 2008. In 2008, all of GWDC operations and assets in Pakistan were acquired by Chuanqing Drilling Engineering Company Limited (CCDC) another subsidiary of CNPC.\n\n\n\n#### Uzbekistan[edit]\n\n\nIn 2006, CNPC formed an international consortium with state-run Uzbekneftegaz, LUKoil Overseas, Petronas, and Korea National Oil Corporation to explore and develop oil and gas fields in the Aral Sea.[29]\n\n\n\n### East Asia[edit]\n\n\n#### China[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2004, CNPC began construction of a pipeline from the Middle East to Xinjiang province.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn June 2023, QatarEnergy signed a 27- year deal with CNPC for 4 million metric tons of LNG to be delivered yearly. This is the second agreement that Qatar has made with a Chinese company in less than a year. In November 2022, Sinopec and QatarEnergy made a similar deal.[30] Both CNPC and Sinopec also have an equity stake in the Qatar North Field eastern expansion which amounts to about 5% of an LNG train of 8 million metric tons of year.[31]\n\n\nCNPC announced that it would begin a 457-day drilling project in the Taklimakan Desert in June 2023 to drill down to the Earth's core, 10,000 metres deep, for scientific purposes and to search for oil and gas.[32][33] In August 2023, CNPC also began ultra-deepwater exploration drilling in search for oil and gas to slowly enable China to rely less on foreign oil.[34]\n\n\n\n### Europe[edit]\n\n\n#### Russia[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2014, A 30-year deal between Russia's Gazprom and China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) which was 10 years in the making was estimated worth $400 billion. The agreement was signed at a summit in Shanghai and is expected to deliver some 38 billion cubic meters of natural gas a year, starting around 2018, to China's burgeoning economy.[35]\n\n\n\n### Oceania[edit]\n\n\n#### New Zealand[edit]\n\n\nCNPC operated in New Zealand as CCDC (NZ) Drilling and had one drilling rig, a triple stand DC rig named Rig 43. CCDC NZ started workover/drilling operations in the Kapuni gas fields of South Taranaki New Zealand in late 2012 for \"tight gas\". The rig completed the Kapuni drilling campaign of 4 wells for STOS (Shell Todd Oil Services) in August 2013. Its next drilling project commenced August 2013 for Tag Oil with one well successfully drilled at Cheal C of a depth of just under 5,000m. The rig was then stood down pending appeals for the next stage of a drilling campaign for Tag Oil in March 2014. Due to the periods involved it was decided to end its drilling campaign in New Zealand. Rig 43 was then dismantled and shipped to other overseas locations and no longer operates in New Zealand.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Southeast Asia[edit]\n\n\n#### Malaysia[edit]\n\n\nChina Petroleum Pipeline Engineering, a unit of CNPC, was the primary contractor working to establish two pipelines in Malaysia. The project was accused of involvement in corruption and was suspended by the Pakatan Harapan seventh cabinet of Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed in 2018. The company denied the allegations. In July 2019, Malaysian authorities seized $243.5M from China Petroleum Pipeline Engineering to compensate for the paid for but unfinished pipelines and transferred to a Malaysian government-owned business.[36]\n\n\n\n### West Asia[edit]\n\n\n#### Iraq[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Rumaila field\n\nIn March 2009, CNPC began development of Ahdab, an oil field in Wasit Governorate holding a modest one billion barrels, becoming \"the first significant foreign investors\" in Iraq.[37] The contract is a renegotiated version of a 1997 agreement between China and Iraq under Saddam Hussein.[38] The project progressed despite security problems with local farmers. Dozens of farmers complained of damage to property because of work on the site and Iraqi oil officials claimed thievery from the oil site by local farmers.[37] Adhab is not expected to be a major profit center, earning the company a projected 1 percent profit, but the field was seen as an entry strategy into Iraq.\n\n\nFollowing Adhab, CNPC obtained a production contract during the 2009/2010 Iraqi oil services contracts tender to develop the much larger \"Rumaila field\" with joint venture partner BP, which contains an estimated 17.8 billion barrels (2.83\u00d7109\u00a0m3) of oil. It is expected that crude oil production from Rumaila will expand by 10% by the end of 2010 once the BP PLC/CNPC consortium takes over development of the field in June 2010.[39][40] A contract was also awarded to a consortium led by CNPC (37.5%), including TotalEnergies (18.75%) and Petronas (18.75%) for the \"Halfaya field\" in the south of Iraq, which contains an estimated 4.1 billion barrels (650,000,000\u00a0m3) of oil.[41][42]\n\n\nIn August 2023, CNPC Daqing Drilling Engineering Co was awarded an EPC to drill wells with two rigs located in the Rumaila oilfield in Iraq. The engineering, procurement and construction contract is said to be worth $194 million and the number of wells allowed to be drilled were not disclosed.[43]\n\n\n\n#### Iran[edit]\n\n\nCNPC became increasingly involved in the development of Iranian oil fields following Western sanctions that targeted the Iranian oil and gas sectors leading many European energy companies such as Shell Oil, Repsol, etc. to shut down operations in Iran. The CNPC along with Sinopec has been involved in various projects relating to Iran's oil/gas development. As of 2011, CNPC has been developing Iran's age-old Masjed Soleyman Oil Field, the oldest oil field of the Middle East, together with Iranian counterpart NIOC in a deal worth 200 million dollars. Production from this particular oil field was expected to increase in 2011 from 2,500 barrels (400\u00a0m3) a day to 25,000 barrels (4,000\u00a0m3) after the completion of the first phase, and to 55,000,000\u00a0bbl/d (8,700,000\u00a0m3/d) following the completion of phase 2 of the project.[44]\n\n\nIn August 2018, TotalEnergies officially withdrew from the Iranian South Pars gas field because of sanctions pressure from the US,[45] leaving CNPC to take up their 50.1% stake in the $5 billion natural gas field, of which it had already 30%.[46] It held this 80.1% share until it withdrew its investment in October 2019 due to the US sanctions on Iran, according to Oil Minister Bijan Zangeneh quoted by the SHANA news agency.[46]\n\n\n\n#### Syria[edit]\n\n\nCNPC with Indian state oil firm, ONGC created a joint venture to acquire minority stakes ranging from about 33.3% to 39% in several mature Syrian oil and natural gas properties. The combined entity was a notable instance of cooperation between two state oil firms that regularly competed for assets around the world.[47]\n\n\n\n#### Qatar[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2023, CNPC signed a 27-year deal with QatarEnergy for 4 million metric tons of LNG to be delivered yearly.[48] CNPC also has an equity stake in the Qatar North Field eastern expansion which amounts to about 5% of an LNG train of 8 million metric tons of year.[49]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\n### Corruption allegations[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2013, Jiang Jiemin, a former chairman of PetroChina, a subsidiary of CNPC, was abruptly removed from his role as director of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council and investigated for corruption and abuse of power, along with four other senior oil executives.[50] Jiang was considered an ally of corrupt former security chief Zhou Yongkang, and part of a group of officials that had political ties with Zhou. On October 12, 2015, the court found Jiang guilty on all counts, including accepting bribes, possessing dark assets, and abusing his power. He was sentenced to 16 years in prison.[51]\n\n\nIn January 2017, former PetroChina vice chairman Liao Yongyuan was sentenced to 15 years in prison for abuse of power and accepting nearly $2 million worth of bribes.[52][53]\n\n\nIn October 2021, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection announced that it was investigating former PetroChina vice president Ling Xiao, for \"serious disciplinary violations.\"[54]\n\n\n\n### Lanzhou Petrochemical contamination[edit]\n\n\nIn 2014, Lanzhou Petrochemical, a subsidiary of CNPC, was responsible for ethylene and ammonia leaks, benzene contamination of water supplies, and air pollution in Lanzhou. City officials criticized the company and demanded an apology.[55]\n\n\n\n### 2003: Chongqing deadly gas leakage[edit]\n\n\nOn 23 December 2003, a gas blowout occurred at the Luojia No. 16H gas well. The toxic fumes killed 243 people and hospitalized substantially more.[56][57] Specialists concluded that the accident was the result of negligence on the part of Eastern Sichuan Drilling Company, which was working under China National Petroleum Corporation.[57] They concluded that Sichuan technicians had failed to fix a blowout-prevention valve, a basic safety measure, that the gas well was built too close to homes, that workers failed to promptly inform authorities, that workers neglected to ignite the gas to prevent disaster, and that the company had not undergone an official environmental and safety assessment before commencing operations.[57] On March 25, 2006, another leak in the Luojia No. 2 gas well in Chongqing required the evacuation of 15,000 people.[56] Three attempts were required to properly seal the leak.[58]\n\n\n\n### Suspension of operations in Chad[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2013, the operations of a CNPC subsidiary in Chad were suspended entirely by the country's government after it had violated environmental standards while drilling for crude oil in the south of the country.[59] \"We found flagrant violations of environmental standards by the company ... CNPC's behavior was unacceptable,\" said Le Bemadjiel, Chad's minister of oil. The minister also claimed that CNPC discharged oil intentionally to reduce costs, did not have facilities to clean spilled crude oil, dumped crude oil without safeguards, and asked locals to help remove crude oil without providing them with appropriate protective gear.\n\n\nIn March 2014, Chad fined CNPC worth a total of $1.2 billion.[60] In August 2014, CNPC had five of its permits revoked after failing to pay the fine.[61] In October 2014, CNPC agreed to pay $400 million.[62]\n\n\n\n### Jilin chemical plant explosion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2005 Jilin chemical plant explosions\n\nIn November 2005, chemical plants belonging to PetroChina, a subsidiary of CNPC, exploded in Jilin, China, resulting in 100 tons of benzene, which is a carcinogen and toxic, pouring into the Songhua River. There was a slick of chemicals that spanned 80 kilometres.[63] Harbin, another city along the Songhua River, had to cut the water supply from almost 4 million people, for 5 days. More than 60 people were injured, five died, and one person was missing due to the incident. The spill reached as far as Khabarovsk, Russia, where residents stocked up on bottled water. The Russian city tried filtering its water of toxic substances, but couldn't guarantee the water was safe.[64] China's environmental agency fined the company one million yuan (approximately $125,000, \u00a364,000) for its pollution, which was the maximum fine that can be handed out in China for breaking an environmental law.[63] The Chinese government said that cleaning up the aftermath would require one billion US dollars.[63] Li Zhaoxing, Chinese Foreign Minister at the time, issued a public apology to Russia due to the incident.[65] The Chinese press responded harshly to the authorities' response to the disaster.[66] Another gas pipeline exploded on 20 January 2006 in Sichuan. Reportedly, nine were killed and nearly 40 injured.[67]\n\n\n\n### Oil spills[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Yellow River oil spill\n\nMain article: Xingang Port oil spill\n\nIn January 2010, it was revealed that a CNPC diesel pipeline had burst near the confluence of the Chishui and Weihe rivers, in Huaxian County, Shaanxi.[68] The extensive pollution ended up in the Yellow River, China's longest waterway.\n\n\nIn July 2010, two pipelines exploded at an oil storage depot belonging to China National Petroleum Corp near Dalian's Xingang Harbour in Liaoning province which spilled an estimated 1,500 tonnes of crude into the sea.[69] Two thousand firefighters took fifteen hours to subdue the fire and the spill reached a size of 180\u00a0km2 (69\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[70]\n\n\n\n### Trade anomalies[edit]\n\n\nOn January 19, 2022, Chinese authorities punished CNPC's subsidiary \"PetroChina Fuel Oil Co Ltd\" for alleged oil trade inconsistencies that \"severely disrupted oil products market order... facilitated blind development of outdated production capacity at independent refineries...caused losses in government tax revenue indirectly,\" said the National Development and Reform Commission.[71]\n\n\n\n### Human rights[edit]\n\n\nIn 2011, Earthrights International accused PetroChina, a subsidiary of CNPC, of complicity in serious human rights abuses in Burma,[72][73] a country known for militarily furthering its economic interests through the use of forced labor.[74][75]\n\n\n\n### Tax issues[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2014, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists published research based on leaked financial records from the British Virgin Islands, implicating CNPC, PetroChina, Sinopec, and CNOOC in offshore tax evasion.[76][77]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)China portal\n* ![icon](image)Energy portal\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n\n\n* List of oil spills\n* CNPC (HK)\n* Petroleum industry in China\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** A common shortname for the corporation in Chinese, *Zhongguo Shiyou* (\u4e2d\u56fd\u77f3\u6cb9), formerly shared the same name as the Chinese Petroleum Corporation, the Republic of China (Taiwan)'s state-owned fuel corporation.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** China National Petroleum Corporation (July 2, 2021). 2020 Annual Report (PDF) (Report). p.\u00a06.
