It is one of two U.S. states not bordered by another state; Hawaii is the other. Alaska has more ocean coastline than all of the other U.S. states combined.[1] About 500 miles (800\u00a0km) of Canadian territory separate Alaska from Washington state. Alaska is thus an exclave of the United States that is part of the continental U.S. and the U.S. West Coast, but is not part of the contiguous U.S.[2]\n\n\n\n![](image)Central Alaska in late September, as seen from a satellite\nThe state is bordered by Yukon and British Columbia, Canada to the east, the Gulf of Alaska and the Pacific Ocean to the south, Russia (Chukotka Autonomous Okrug), Bering Sea, the Bering Strait, and Chukchi Sea to the west, and the Beaufort Sea and the Arctic Ocean to the north.\n\n\n\n![](image)Alaska's area compared to the 48 contiguous states Because it extends into the Eastern Hemisphere, it is technically both the westernmost and easternmost state in the United States, as well as also being the northernmost.\n\n\nAlaska is the largest state in the United States in terms of land area at 570,380 square miles (1,477,300\u00a0km2), over twice (roughly 2.47 times) as large as Texas, the next largest state, and is the seventh largest country subdivision in the world, and the third largest in North America, about 20.4% smaller than Denmark's autonomous country of Greenland and 17.6% smaller than Canada's largest territory of Nunavut. If the state's westernmost point were superimposed on San Francisco, California, its easternmost point would be in Jacksonville, Florida. Alaska is larger than all but 18 sovereign nations (it is slightly larger than Iran but slightly smaller than Libya). Alaska is home to 3.5 million lakes of 20 acres (8.1\u00a0ha) or larger.[3] Marshlands and wetland permafrost cover 188,320 square miles (487,700\u00a0km2) (mostly in northern, western and southwest flatlands). Frozen water, in the form of glacier ice, covers some 16,000 square miles (41,000\u00a0km2) of land and 1,200 square miles (3,100\u00a0km2) of tidal zone. The Bering Glacier complex near the southeastern border with Yukon, Canada, covers 2,250 square miles (5,800\u00a0km2) alone.\n\n\n\n\n## Regions[edit]\n\n\n* South Central Alaska is the southern coastal region and contains most of the state's population. Anchorage and many growing towns, such as Palmer, and Wasilla, lie within this area. Petroleum industrial plants, transportation, tourism, and two military bases form the core of the economy here.\n* The Alaska Panhandle, also known as Southeast Alaska, is home to many of Alaska's larger towns including the state capital Juneau, tidewater glaciers and extensive forests. Tourism, fishing, forestry and state government anchor the economy.\n* Southwest Alaska is largely coastal, bordered by both the Pacific Ocean and the Bering Sea. It is sparsely populated, and unconnected to the road system, but incredibly important to the fishing industry. Half of all fish caught in the western U.S. come from the Bering Sea, and Bristol Bay has the world's largest sockeye salmon fishery. Southwest Alaska includes Katmai and Lake Clark national parks as well as numerous wildlife refuges. The region comprises western Cook Inlet, Bristol Bay and its watersheds, the Alaska Peninsula and the Aleutian Islands. It is known for wet and stormy weather, tundra landscapes, and large populations of salmon, brown bears, caribou, birds, and marine mammals.\n* The Alaska Interior is home to Fairbanks. The geography is marked by large braided rivers, such as the Yukon River and the Kuskokwim River, as well as Arctic tundra lands and shorelines.\n* The Alaskan Bush is the remote, less crowded part of the state, encompassing 380 native villages and small towns such as Nome, Bethel, Kotzebue and, most famously, Utqia\u0121vik, the northernmost town in the United States.\n\n\nThe northeast corner of Alaska is covered by the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Much of the northwest is covered by the larger National Petroleum Reserve\u2013Alaska, which covers around 23\u00a0million acres (9,307,770\u00a0ha). The Arctic is Alaska's most remote wilderness. A location in the National Petroleum Reserve\u2013Alaska is 120 miles (190\u00a0km) from any town or village, the geographic point most remote from permanent habitation in the United States.\n\n\nWith its numerous islands, Alaska has nearly 34,000 miles (55,000\u00a0km) of tidal shoreline. The island chain extending west from the southern tip of the Alaska Peninsula is called the Aleutian Islands. Many active volcanoes are found in the Aleutians. For example, Unimak Island is home to Mount Shishaldin, a moderately active volcano that rises to 9,980 feet (3,042\u00a0m) above sea level. The chain of volcanoes extends to Mount Spurr, west of Anchorage on the mainland.\n\n\nOne of North America's largest tides occurs in Turnagain Arm just south of Anchorage. Tidal differences can be more than 35 feet (10.7\u00a0m). (Many sources say Turnagain has the second-greatest tides in North America, but it has since been shown that several areas in Canada have larger tides, according to an Anchorage Daily News article dated 6/23/03.[4])\n\n\nThe Aleutian Islands cross longitude 180\u00b0, so Alaska can be considered the easternmost state as well as the westernmost. Alaska and, especially, the Aleutians are one of the extreme points of the United States. The International Date Line jogs west of 180\u00b0 to keep the whole state, and thus the entire continental United States, within the same legal day.\n\n\n\n* ![Near Little Port Walter in Southeast Alaska](image)\n\nNear Little Port Walter in Southeast Alaska\n* ![Nushagak River in Southwest Alaska](image)\n\nNushagak River in Southwest Alaska\n* ![Mount Sanford in the Wrangell Mountains](image)\n\nMount Sanford in the Wrangell Mountains\n* ![Kenai River on the Kenai Peninsula](image)\n\nKenai River on the Kenai Peninsula\n* ![Calving glacier](image)\n\nCalving glacier\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Alaska\n\n![](image)Alaska has more acreage of public land owned by the federal government than any other state.[5]\nThe climate in south and southeastern Alaska is a mid-latitude oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: *Cfb*), and a subarctic oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen *Cfc*) in the northern parts. On an annual basis, the southeast is both the wettest and warmest part of Alaska with milder temperatures in the winter and high precipitation throughout the year. Juneau averages over 50\u00a0in (130\u00a0cm) of precipitation a year, and Ketchikan averages over 150\u00a0in (380\u00a0cm).[6] This is also the only region in Alaska in which the average daytime high temperature is above freezing during the winter months.\n\n\n\n![](image)K\u00f6ppen climate types of Alaska\nThe climate of Anchorage and south central Alaska is mild by Alaskan standards due to the region's proximity to the seacoast. While the area gets less rain than southeast Alaska, it gets more snow, and days tend to be clearer. On average, Anchorage receives 16\u00a0in (41\u00a0cm) of precipitation a year, with around 75\u00a0in (190\u00a0cm) of snow, although there are areas in the south central which receive far more snow. It is a subarctic climate (K\u00f6ppen: *Dfc*) due to its brief, cool summers.\n\n\nThe climate of western Alaska is determined in large part by the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska. It is a subarctic oceanic climate in the southwest and a continental subarctic climate farther north. The temperature is somewhat moderate considering how far north the area is. This region has a tremendous amount of variety in precipitation. An area stretching from the northern side of the Seward Peninsula to the Kobuk River valley (i.e., the region around Kotzebue Sound) is technically a desert, with portions receiving less than 10\u00a0in (25\u00a0cm) of precipitation annually. On the other extreme, some locations between Dillingham and Bethel average around 100\u00a0in (250\u00a0cm) of precipitation.[7]\n\n\nThe climate of the interior of Alaska is subarctic. Some of the highest and lowest temperatures in Alaska occur around the area near Fairbanks. The summers may have temperatures reaching into the 90s \u00b0F (the low-to-mid 30s \u00b0C), while in the winter, the temperature can fall below \u221260\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221251\u00a0\u00b0C). Precipitation is sparse in the Interior, often less than 10\u00a0in (25\u00a0cm) a year, but what precipitation falls in the winter tends to stay the entire winter.\n\n\nThe highest and lowest recorded temperatures in Alaska are both in the Interior. The highest is 100\u00a0\u00b0F (38\u00a0\u00b0C) in Fort Yukon (which is just 8\u00a0mi or 13\u00a0km inside the arctic circle) on June 27, 1915,[8][9] making Alaska tied with Hawaii as the state with the lowest high temperature in the United States.[10][11] The lowest official Alaska temperature is \u221280\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221262\u00a0\u00b0C) in Prospect Creek on January 23, 1971,[8][9] one degree above the lowest temperature recorded in continental North America (in Snag, Yukon, Canada).[12]\n\n\nThe climate in the extreme north of Alaska is Arctic (K\u00f6ppen: *ET*) with long, very cold winters and short, cool summers. Even in July, the average low temperature in Utqia\u0121vik is 34\u00a0\u00b0F (1\u00a0\u00b0C).[13] Precipitation is light in this part of Alaska, with many places averaging less than 10\u00a0in (25\u00a0cm) per year, mostly as snow which stays on the ground almost the entire year.\n\n\n\n### Climate data[edit]\n\n\n\n\nAverage daily maximum and minimum temperatures for selected locations in Alaska[14]\n| Location\n | July (\u00b0F)\n | July (\u00b0C)\n | January (\u00b0F)\n | January (\u00b0C)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Anchorage | 65/51 | 18/10 | 22/11 | \u22125/\u221211\n |\n| Juneau | 64/50 | 17/11 | 32/23 | 0/\u22124\n |\n| Ketchikan | 64/51 | 17/11 | 38/28 | 3/\u22121\n |\n| Unalaska | 57/46 | 14/8 | 36/28 | 2/\u22122\n |\n| Fairbanks | 72/53 | 22/11 | 1/\u221217 | \u221217/\u221227\n |\n| Fort Yukon | 73/51 | 23/10 | \u221211/\u221227 | \u221223/\u221233\n |\n| Nome | 58/46 | 14/8 | 13/\u22122 | \u221210/\u221219\n |\n| Utqia\u0121vik | 47/34 | 08/1 | \u22127/\u221219 | \u221221/\u221228\n |\n\n\n## Land management[edit]\n\n\nAccording to an October 1998 report by the United States Bureau of Land Management, approximately 65% of Alaska is owned and managed by the U.S. federal government as national forests, national parks, and national wildlife refuges. Of these, the Bureau of Land Management manages 87\u00a0million acres (35\u00a0million hectares), or 23.8% of the state. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\n\n\n![](image)Map of Geography of Alaska - PDF\nOf the remaining land area, the State of Alaska owns 24.5%; another 10% is managed by thirteen regional and dozens of local Native corporations created under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. Various private interests own the remaining land, totaling less than 1%.\n\n\nAlaska is administratively divided into \"boroughs,\" as opposed to \"counties.\" The function is the same, but whereas some states use a three-tiered system of decentralization \u2014 state/county/township \u2014 most of Alaska only uses two tiers \u2014 state/borough. Owing to the state's low population density, most of the land is located in the Unorganized Borough which, as the name implies, has no intermediate borough government of its own, but is administered directly by the state government. Currently (2000 census) 57.71 percent of Alaska's land area has this status; however, its population comprises only 13.05 percent of the state's total. For statistical purposes the United States Census Bureau divides this territory into census areas. Anchorage merged the city government with the Greater Anchorage Area Borough in 1971 to form the Municipality of Anchorage, containing the city proper, and the bedroom communities of Eagle River, Chugiak, Peters Creek, Girdwood, Bird Creek, and Indian. Fairbanks, on the other hand, has a separate borough (the Fairbanks North Star Borough) and municipality (the City of Fairbanks).[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Matanuska glacier\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Alaska census statistical areas\n* Alaska Peninsula\n* Bristol Bay\n* List of Alaska rivers\n* List of boroughs and census areas in Alaska\n* List of Ultras of Alaska\n* Mountain peaks of Alaska\n* List of areas disputed by Canada and the United States\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RS21729.pdf CRS Report for Congress on international borders\n2. **^** The other three exclaves of the United States are the Northwest Angle of Minnesota, Point Roberts, Washington, and Alburgh, Vermont.\n3. **^** \"Facts About Alaska, Alaska Kids' Corner, State of Alaska\". *alaska.gov*.

Occupying about 7% of the total water and land area of the U.S.,[1] it is the second largest state after Alaska, and is the southernmost part of the Great Plains, which end in the south against the folded Sierra Madre Oriental of Mexico. Texas is in the South Central United States of America, and is considered to form part of the U.S. South and also part of the U.S. Southwest.[2]\n\n\nBy residents, the state is generally divided into North Texas, East Texas, Central Texas, South Texas, West Texas and, sometimes, the Panhandle, but according to the *Texas Almanac*, Texas has four major physical regions: Gulf Coastal Plains, Interior Lowlands, Great Plains, and Basin and Range Province. This has been cited as the difference between human geography and physical geography, although the fact that Texas was granted the prerogative to divide into as many as five U.S. states may be a historical motive for Texans defining their state as containing exactly five regions.[3]\n\n\nSome regions in Texas are more associated with the American Southeast (primarily East Texas, Central Texas, and North Texas), while the Panhandle is considered by many to have more in common with parts of the plains Midwest than either the South or Southwest. Geographically and culturally, El Paso is closer to New Mexico or Arizona than it is to Austin or to East Texas. The size of Texas prohibits easy categorization of the entire state wholly in any recognized region of the United States, and even cultural diversity among regions of the state makes it difficult to treat Texas as a region in its own right.\n\n\n\n\n## Physical geography[edit]\n\n\nTexas covers a total area of 268,581 square miles (695,622\u00a0km2). The longest straight-line distance is from the northwest corner of the panhandle to the Rio Grande river just below Brownsville, 801 miles (1,289\u00a0km).[1] The greatest east\u2013west distance is 773 miles (1,244\u00a0km) from the extreme eastward bend in the Sabine River in Newton County to the extreme western bulge of the Rio Grande just above El Paso.[4] The largest continental state is so expansive that El Paso, in the western corner of the state, is closer to San Diego, California, than to the Houston/Beaumont area, near the Louisiana state line; while Orange, on the border with Louisiana, is closer to Jacksonville, Florida, than it is to El Paso. Texarkana, in the northeastern corner of the state, is about the same distance from Chicago, Illinois, as it is from El Paso, and Dalhart, in the northwestern corner of the state, is closer to the state capitals of Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Wyoming than it is to Austin, its own state capital.[5]\n\n\nThe geographic center of Texas is about 15 miles (24\u00a0km) northeast of Brady in northern McCulloch County. Guadalupe Peak, at 8,749 feet (2,666.7\u00a0m) above sea level, is the highest point in Texas, the lowest being sea level where Texas meets the Gulf of Mexico.[6] Texas has five state forests and 120 state parks totalling over 605,000 acres (2,450\u00a0km2).[7] There are 3,700 named streams and 15 major river systems flowing through 191,000 miles (307,000\u00a0km) of Texas, supporting over 212 reservoirs.[8]\n\n\nWith 10 climatic regions, 14 soil regions, and 11 distinct ecological regions, regional classification becomes problematic with differences in soils, topography, geology, rainfall, and plant and animal communities.[9]\n\n\n\n### Coast and estuaries[edit]\n\n\nMuch of the 367-mile (591\u00a0km) Gulf coastline of Texas is paralleled by the Texas barrier islands, many of which enclose a series of estuaries where the state's rivers mix with water from the Gulf of Mexico. These water bodies include some of the largest and most ecologically productive coastal estuaries in the United States and contribute significantly to the ecological and economic resources of Texas.[10]\n\n\n\n### Coastal Plains[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Caddo Lake\nThe Gulf Coastal Plains extends from the Gulf of Mexico inland to the Balcones Fault and the Eastern Cross Timbers. This large area stretches from the cities of Paris to San Antonio to Del Rio but shows a large variety in vegetation. Ranging from 20 to 58 inches (510 to 1,470\u00a0mm) of annual rainfall, this is a nearly level, drained plain dissected by streams and rivers flowing into coastal estuaries and marshes. Windblown sands and dunes, grasslands, oak mottes and salt marshes make up the seaward areas.[11] National Parks include Big Thicket National Preserve, Padre Island National Seashore and the Palo Alto Battlefield National Historic Site.[12]\n\n\n\n### North Central Plains[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Looking north at the Caprock Escarpment.\nThe North Central Plains are bounded by the Caprock Escarpment to the west, the Edwards Plateau to the south, and the Eastern Cross Timbers to the east. This area includes the North Central Plains around the cities of Abilene and Wichita Falls, the Western Cross Timbers to the west of Fort Worth, the Grand Prairie, and the Eastern Cross Timbers to the east of Dallas. With about 35 to 50 inches (890 to 1,270\u00a0mm) annual rainfall, gently rolling to hilly forested land is part of a larger pine-hardwood forest of oaks, hickories, elm and gum trees.[11] Soils vary from coarse sands to tight clays or shet rock clays and shales.[13]\n\n\n\n### Great Plains[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hill Country\nThe Great Plains include the Llano Estacado, the Panhandle, Edwards Plateau, Toyah Basin, and the Llano Uplift. It is bordered on the east by the Caprock Escarpment in the panhandle and by the Balcones Fault to the southeast. Cities in this region include Midland and Odessa, Lubbock, and Amarillo. The Hill Country is a popular name for the area of hills along the Balcones Escarpment and is a transitional area between the Great Plains and the Gulf Coastal Plains. With about 15 to 31 inches (380 to 790\u00a0mm) annual rainfall, the southern end of the Great Plains are gently rolling plains of shrub and grassland, and home to the dramatic Caprock Canyons and Palo Duro Canyon state parks.[11] The largest concentration of playa lakes in the world (nearly 22,000) is on the Southern High Plains of Texas and Eastern New Mexico.\n\n\nTexas's blackland prairies were some of the first areas farmed in Texas. Highly expansive clays with characteristic dark coloration, called the Houston Black series, occur on about 1.5 million acres (6,000\u00a0km2) extending from north of Dallas south to San Antonio. The Professional Soil Scientists Association of Texas has recommended to the State Legislature that the Houston Black series be designated the State soil. The series was established in 1902.[14] National Parks in this area are the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park and the San Antonio Missions National Historical Park.[12]\n\n\n\n### Mountains and basins[edit]\n\n\n![](image)El Capitan\nThe Trans-Pecos Natural Region has less than 12 inches (300\u00a0mm) annual rainfall. The most complex Natural Region, it includes Sand Hills, the Stockton Plateau, desert valleys, wooded mountain slopes and desert grasslands. The Basin and Range Province is in West Texas, west of the Pecos River, beginning with the Davis Mountains on the east and the Rio Grande to its west and south. The Trans-Pecos region is the only part of Texas regarded as mountainous and includes seven named peaks in elevation greater than 8,000 feet (2,400\u00a0m). This region includes sand hills, desert valleys, wooded mountain slopes and desert grasslands.[11] The vegetation diversity includes at least 268 grass species and 447 species of woody plants.[15] National Parks include the Amistad National Recreation Area, Big Bend National Park, Chamizal National Memorial, Fort Davis National Historic Site, Guadalupe Mountains National Park, and the Rio Grande Wild and Scenic River.[12] This area is part of the Chihuahuan Desert.\n\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Texas\n\n![](image)K\u00f6ppen climate classification types of Texas\nContinental, Mountain, and Modified Marine are the three major climatic types of Texas, with no distinguishable boundaries. Modified Marine, or subtropical, dominates the majority of the state.[16] Texas has an annual precipitation range from 60.57 inches (1,538\u00a0mm) in Jasper County, East Texas, to 9.43 inches (240\u00a0mm) in El Paso. The record high of 120\u00a0\u00b0F (49\u00a0\u00b0C) was reached at Seymour on 12 August 1936, and Monahans on 28 June 1994. The low also ties at \u221223\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221231\u00a0\u00b0C) in Tulia on 12 February 1899, and Seminole on 8 February 1933.[17]\n\n\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geology of Texas\n\nTexas is mostly sedimentary rocks, with East Texas underlain by a Cretaceous and younger sequence of sediments, the trace of ancient shorelines east and south until the active continental margin of the Gulf of Mexico is met.[*citation needed*] This sequence is built atop the subsided crest of the Appalachian Mountains\u2013Ouachita Mountains\u2013Marathon Mountains zone of Pennsylvanian continental collision, which collapsed when rifting in Jurassic time opened the Gulf of Mexico. West from this orogenic crest, which is buried beneath the Dallas\u2013Waco\u2013Austin\u2013San Antonio trend, the sediments are Permian and Triassic in age. Oil is found in the Cretaceous sediments in the east, the Permian sediments in the west, and along the Gulf coast and out on the Texas continental shelf. A few exposures of Precambrian igneous and metamorphic rocks are found in the central and western parts of the state, and Oligocene volcanic rocks are found in far west Texas, in the Big Bend area. A blanket of Miocene sediments known as the Ogallala formation in the western high plains region is an important aquifer. Texas has no active or dormant volcanoes and few earthquakes, being situated far from an active plate tectonic boundary. The Big Bend area is the most seismically active; however, the area is sparsely populated and suffers minimal damages and injuries, and no known fatalities have been attributed to a Texas earthquake.\n\n\n\n## Resources[edit]\n\n\nWith a large supply of natural resources, Texas is a major agricultural and industrial state, producing oil, cattle, sheep, and cotton. The state also produces poultry, eggs, dairy products, greenhouse and nursery products, wheat, hay, rice, sugar cane, and peanuts, and a range of fruits and vegetables.[18]\n\n\n\n* Asphalt-bearing rocks, mainly cretaceous limestones, occur in Bexar, Burnet, Kinney, Uvalde, and other counties.\n* Cement is produced in Bexar, Comal, Dallas, Ector, Ellis, El Paso, Harris, Hays, McLennan, Nolan, Nueces, Potter, and Tarrant counties. Historically, Texas' Portland cement output accounts for about 10% of the annual United States production.[*citation needed*]\n* With an abundance of various types of clays, Texas is one of the leading producers of clays.\n* Bituminous coal occurs primarily in Coleman, Eastland, Erath, Jack, McCulloch, Montague, Palo Pinto, Parker, Throckmorton, Wise, and Young counties of Texas. Lignite, or brown coal, occurs in deposits in the Texas Coastal Plain.\n* Fluorspar or fluorite is an important industrial mineral used in the manufacture of steel, aluminum, glass, and fluorocarbons. It occurs at several localities in the Trans-Pecos and Llano regions of Texas.\n* Collecting gemstone rock and mineral specimens has proved quite profitable. Agate, jasper, cinnabar, fluorite, topaz, calcite, opal, petrified wood, and tektites are all commonly collected.\n* Deposits of graphite occur in the Llano region and was previously produced in Burnet County.\n* Bat guano occurs in numerous caverns in the Edwards Plateau and in the Trans-Pecos region and to a more limited extent in Central Texas.\n* Gypsum is extensively developed in Texas where the main occurrences are in the Permian Basin, the Cretaceous Edwards Formation in Gillespie and Menard counties, and the Gulf Coast salt domes of Harris County and previously Brooks County.\n* Texas is the leading producer of helium solely from the Cliffside gas field near Amarillo.\n* Deposits of iron ore are present in northeastern Texas as well as several in Central Texas.\n* Elements of the Lanthanide series are commonly termed rare-earth elements. Several of the rare earths have anomalous concentrations in the rhyolitic and related igneous rocks in the Trans-Pecos area of Texas. A deposit containing several rare-earth minerals was exposed at Barringer Hill in Llano County before it was covered by the waters of Lake Buchanan.\n* Limestones, abundant in many parts of Texas, are used in the manufacture of lime. Plants for the production of lime are operating in Bexar, Bosque, Burnet, Comal, Deaf Smith, Hill, Johnson, Nueces, and Travis counties.\n* Magnesium chloride, magnesium sulfate and other mineral salts are present in the Upper Permian Basin and in the underlying playas of the High Plains.\n* Manganese is known to occur in Precambrian rocks in Mason and Llano counties, in Val Verde County, in Jeff Davis County, and in Dickens County.\n* Mica is present in Precambrian pegmatite in the Llano region.\n* Common opal occurs on the Texas Coastal Plain.\n* Salts occurs in large quantities in salt domes in the Texas Coastal Plain and with other evaporites in the Permian Basin of West Texas, as well as near Grand Saline, Texas.\n* Sands used for industrial purposes commonly have been found in the Texas Coastal Plains, East Texas, north central Texas, and Central Texas; and sand mines have opened in the Shinnery (dunes) ecosystem of northern West Texas and the eastern part of the West Wingtip.\n* The discovery of silver in Texas has been credited by some to Franciscans who discovered and operated mines near El Paso about 1680. Documented silver production started in the late 1880s at the Presidio Mine, in Presidio County. Texas produced 32,663,405 troy ounces of silver between 1885 and 1955.\n* Sulfur occurs in the caprocks of salt domes in the Gulf Coastal Plain, in Permian-age bedded deposits in Trans-Pecos Texas.\n* In the past, uranium was produced from surface mines in Atascosa, Gonzales, Karnes, and Live Oak counties. All uranium mines are closed and Texas is no longer a producer.[19]\n* The Barnett Shale, located in the Fort Worth basin, has gained attention in recent years as a source of natural gas. Controversy regarding drilling and exploration rights is an issue.\n\n\n## Regions[edit]\n\n\nThere are several different methods used to describe the geographic and geological differences within the state, and there are often subdivisions within a region which more accurately describe both the terrain and the culture.[20] Because there is no single standard for subdividing the regions of Texas, many accepted areas either overlap or seem to contradict others. All are included for completeness.\n\n\n\n![](image)This MECE (mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive) partition of the 254 counties into 12 economic regions is used by the Texas comptroller for various analysis and reporting purposes.[21]\n* Big Bend\n* Blackland Prairies\n* Brazos Valley\n* Canadian River Valley\n* Central Texas\n* Concho Valley\n* Coastal Bend\n* Cross Timbers\n* East Texas\n* Edwards Plateau\n* Gulf Coast (of the US)\n* Llano Estacado[22]\n* North Texas\n* Northeast Texas\n* Permian Basin\n* Piney Woods\n* Red River Valley\n* Rio Grande Valley\n* South Plains[23] The vernacular term 'South Plains' is part of Llano Estacado, listed above.\n* South Texas\n* Southeast Texas\n* Texas Hill Country[24]\n* Texas Panhandle\n* Texas Urban Triangle\n* Trans-Pecos\n* West Texas\n\n\n### Geographical regions that extend into Texas[edit]\n\n\n* Southwestern United States\n* Southern United States\n* Deep South\n* Black Belt\n* Great Plains\n* Chihuahuan Desert\n* High Plains\n* Piney Woods\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Texas portal\n\n\n* List of rivers of Texas\n* List of lakes in Texas\n* List of regions of the United States\n* List of ecoregions in the United States (EPA)\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Texas' Natural Environment\". *Texas Almanac*.

Covering an area of 163,696\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (423,970\u00a0km2), California is among the most geographically diverse states. The Sierra Nevada, the fertile farmlands of the Central Valley, and the arid Mojave Desert of the south are some of the major geographic features of this U.S. state. It is home to some of the world's most exceptional trees: the tallest (coast redwood), most massive (Giant Sequoia), and oldest (bristlecone pine). It is also home to both the highest (Mount Whitney) and lowest (Death Valley) points in the 48 contiguous states.\nThe state is generally divided into Northern and Southern California, although the boundary between the two is not well defined. San Francisco is decidedly a Northern California city and Los Angeles likewise a Southern California one, but areas in between do not often share their confidence in geographic identity. The US Geological Survey defines the geographic center of the state at a point near North Fork, California.[*tone*]\n\n\nEarth scientists typically divide the state into eleven distinct geomorphic provinces with clearly defined boundaries. They are, from north to south, the Klamath Mountains, the Cascade Range, the Modoc Plateau, the Basin and Range, the Coast Ranges, the Central Valley, the Sierra Nevada, the Transverse Ranges, the Mojave Desert, the Peninsular Ranges, and the Colorado Desert.\n\n\n\n\n## State boundaries[edit]\n\n\nThe boundaries of California were defined by Spanish claims of Mexico, as part of the province of Alta California. The northern boundary of Spanish claims was set at 42 degrees latitude by the Adams\u2013Onis Treaty of 1819.[1] The states of Nevada and Utah, also originally part of Alta California, also use that line for their northern boundaries. The southern boundary, between California and Mexico, was established by the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo that ended the Mexican\u2013American War in 1848. The line is about 30 miles north of the former Alta California southern boundary. The eastern boundary consists of two straight lines: a north\u2013south line from the northern border to the middle of Lake Tahoe, and a second line angling southeast to the Colorado River. From that point, 14\u00a0mi (23\u00a0km) south-southwest of Davis Dam on Lake Mohave, the southeast boundary follows the Colorado River to the international border west of Yuma. The eastern and south-eastern boundaries were decided upon during the debates of the California Constitutional Convention in 1849.\n\n\n\n## Northern California[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mount Shasta from Interstate 5\nMain article: Northern California\n\nNorthern California usually refers to the state's northernmost 48 counties.\n\n\nThe main population centers of Northern California include San Francisco Bay Area (which includes the cities of San Francisco, Oakland, and the largest city of the region, San Jose), and Sacramento (the state capital) as well as its metropolitan area. It also contains redwood forests, along with the Sierra Nevada including Yosemite Valley and Lake Tahoe, Mount Shasta (the second-highest peak in the Cascade Range after Mount Rainier in Washington), and the northern half of the Central Valley, one of the world's most productive agricultural regions. The climate can be generally characterized by its marine to warm Mediterranean climates along the coast, to a somewhat continental Mediterranean climate in the valley to alpine climate zones in the high mountains. Apart from the San Francisco Bay Area and Sacramento metropolitan areas (and some other cities in the Central Valley), it is a region of relatively low population density. Northern California's economy is noted for being the de facto world leader in industries such as high technology (both software and semiconductor), as well as being known for clean power, biomedical, government, and finance.\n\n\n\n![](image)Alpine tarn in the Trinity Alps\n### Klamath Mountains[edit]\n\n\nThe Klamath Mountains are a range in northwest California and southwest Oregon, the highest peak being Mount Eddy in Trinity County, California, at 9,037 feet (2,754\u00a0m).[2] The range has a varied geology, with substantial areas of serpentine and marble. The climate is characterized by moderately cold winters with heavy snowfall and warm, very dry summers with limited rainfall.[3] As a consequence of the geology, the mountains have a unique flora, including several endemic or near-endemic species, such as Lawson's Cypress (Chamaecyparis lawsoniana) and Foxtail Pine (Pinus balfouriana). Brewer's Spruce *(Picea breweriana)* and Kalmiopsis *(Kalmiopsis leachiana)* are relict species, remaining since the last ice age.[4]\n\n\n\n### Cascade Range[edit]\n\n\nThe Cascade Range is a mountainous region stretching from the Fraser River in British Columbia, Canada down to south of Lassen Peak, California.[5] The Cascades (as they are called for short) are part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, the ring of volcanoes around the Pacific Ocean.[6] All of the known historic eruptions in the contiguous United States have been from either Cascade volcanoes or near Mono Lake.[7]:\u200a7 Lassen Peak was the last Cascade volcano to erupt in California, from 1914 to 1921. Lassen is the most southerly active volcano of the Cascade chain.[8]\n\n\nThis region is located in the northeastern section of the state bordering Oregon and Nevada, mostly north of the Central Valley and the Sierra Nevada mountain range. The area is centered on Mount Shasta, near the Trinity Alps. Mount Shasta is a dormant volcano, but there is some evidence that it erupted in the 18th century.[7]:\u200a99\n\n\n\n### Modoc Plateau[edit]\n\n\nIn the northeast corner of the state lies the Modoc Plateau, an expanse of lava flows that formed a million years ago and now lie at an altitude of 4,000 to 5,000 feet (1,200 to 1,500\u00a0m).[9] The plateau has many cinder cones, juniper flats, pine forests, and seasonal lakes.[10] The plateau lies between the Cascade Range to the west and the Warner Mountains to the east.[9] The Lost River watershed drains the north part of the plateau, while southern watersheds either collect in basin reservoirs or flow into Big Sage Reservoir and thence to the Pit River.\n\n\nNine percent of the plateau is protected as reserves or wilderness areas,[9] such as the Modoc National Wildlife Refuge.[11] The plateau supports large herds of mule deer (*Odocoileus hemionus*), Rocky Mountain Elk (*Cervus canadensis*), and pronghorn (*Antilocapra americana*).[9] Herds of wild horses and livestock grazing have altered the original high desert ecosystem of the plateau.[9]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mono Lake\n### Basin and Range[edit]\n\n\nTo the east of the Sierra is the Basin and Range geological province, which extends into Nevada. The Basin and Range is a series of mountains and valleys (specifically horsts and grabens), caused by the extension of the Earth's crust.[12] One notable feature of the Basin and Range is Mono Lake, which is the oldest lake in North America.[13] The Basin and Range also contains the Owens Valley, the deepest valley in North America (more than 10,000 feet (3\u00a0km) deep, as measured from the top of Mount Whitney).[14]\n\n\nIn the eastern part of the state, below the Sierra Nevada, there is a series of dry lake beds that were filled with water during the last ice age (fed by ice melt from alpine glaciers but never directly affected by glaciation; see pluvial).[15] Many of these lakes have extensive evaporite deposits that contain a variety of different salts. In fact, the salt sediments of many of these lake beds have been mined for many years for various salts, most notably borax (this is most famously true for Owens Lake and Death Valley).\n\n\nIn this province reside the White Mountains, which are home to the oldest living organism in the world, the bristlecone pine[16]\n\n\n\n### Coast Ranges[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Skyline Boulevard, along the crest of the Santa Cruz Mountains\nTo the west of the Central Valley lies the Coast Ranges, including the Diablo Range, just east of San Francisco, and the Santa Cruz Mountains, to the south of San Francisco. The Coast Ranges north of San Francisco become increasingly foggy and rainy. These mountains are noted for their coast redwoods, the tallest trees on earth, which live within the range of the coastal fog.\n\n\n\n### Central Valley[edit]\n\n\nCalifornia's geography is largely defined by its central feature\u2014the Central Valley, a huge, fertile valley between the coastal mountain ranges and the Sierra Nevada. The northern part of the Central Valley is called the Sacramento Valley, after its main river, and the southern part is called the San Joaquin Valley /\u02ccs\u00e6n w\u0251\u02d0\u02c8ki\u02d0n/, after its main river. The whole Central Valley is watered by mountain-fed rivers (notably the San Joaquin, Kings, and Sacramento) that drain to the San Francisco Bay system. The rivers are sufficiently large and deep that several inland cities, notably Stockton, and Sacramento are seaports.\n\n\nThe southern tip of the valley has interior drainage and thus is not technically part of the valley at all. Tulare Lake, once 570 square miles (1,476 square kilometers) and was dry until the winter of 2022 and early spring of 2023, and partially covered with agricultural fields, once filled much of the area.\n\n\n\n![](image)Little Lakes Valley in the eastern Sierra Nevada\n### Sierra Nevada[edit]\n\n\nIn the east of the state lies the Sierra Nevada, which runs north\u2013south for 400 miles (640\u00a0km). The highest peak in the contiguous United States, Mount Whitney at 14,505 feet (4.42\u00a0km), lies within the Sierra Nevada. The topography of the Sierra is shaped by uplift and glacial action.\n\n\nThe Sierra has 200\u2013250 sunny days each year, warm summers, fierce winters, and varied terrain, a rare combination of rugged variety and pleasant weather. The famous Yosemite Valley lies in the Central Sierra. The large, deep freshwater Lake Tahoe lies to the North of Yosemite. The Sierra is also home to the Giant Sequoia, the most massive trees on Earth.\n\n\nThe most famous hiking and horse-packing trail in the Sierra is the John Muir Trail, which goes from the top of Mt. Whitney to Yosemite valley. This is part of the Pacific Crest Trail that goes from Mexico to Canada. The three major national parks in this province are Yosemite National Park, Kings Canyon National Park, and Sequoia National Park.\n\n\n\n\n## Southern California[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Southern California\nMain articles: Southern California and Geography of southern California\n\nThe term Southern California usually refers to the ten southernmost counties which closely match the lower one-third of California's span of latitude. This definition coincides neatly with the county lines at 35\u00b0 47\u2032 28\u2033 north latitude, which form the northern borders of San Luis Obispo, Kern, and San Bernardino counties. Another definition for Southern California uses the Tehachapi Mountains as geographic landmarks for the northern boundary.\n\n\nSouthern California consists of a heavily developed urban environment, home to some of the largest urban areas in the state, along with vast areas that have been left undeveloped. With over 22 million people, roughly 60% of California's population resides in Southern California. It is the second-largest urbanized region in the United States, second only to the Washington/Philadelphia/New York/Boston Northeastern Megalopolis. Where these cities are dense, with major downtown populations and significant rail and transit systems, much of Southern California is famous for its large, spread-out, suburban communities and use of automobiles and highways. The dominant areas are Los Angeles, Orange County, San Diego, and Riverside-San Bernardino, each of which is the center of its respective metropolitan area, composed of numerous smaller cities and communities. The urban area is also host to an international metropolitan region in the form of San Diego\u2013Tijuana, created by the urban area spilling over into Baja California.\n\n\nSouthern California is noted for industries including the film industry, residential construction, entertainment industry, and military aerospace. Other industries include software, automotive, ports, finance, tourism, biomedical, and regional logistics.\n\n\n\n### Transverse Ranges[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mount San Gorgonio, the highest mountain in Southern California\n![](image)Even after the snow melts in San Bernardino, the San Bernardino Mountains in the background retain the snow.\nSouthern California is separated from the rest of the state by the east\u2013west trending Transverse Ranges, including the Tehachapi, which separate the Central Valley from the Mojave Desert. Urban Southern California intersperses the valleys between the Santa Susana Mountains, Santa Monica Mountains and San Gabriel Mountains, which range from the Pacific Coast, eastward over 100 miles (160\u00a0km), to the San Bernardino Mountains, north of San Bernardino. The highest point of the range is Mount San Gorgonio at 11,499 feet (3,505\u00a0m). The San Gabriel Mountains have Mount Wilson observatory, where the redshift was discovered in the 1920s.\n\n\nThe Transverse Ranges include a series of east\u2013west trending mountain ranges that extend from Point Conception at the western tip of Santa Barbara County, eastward (and a bit south) to the east end of the San Jacinto Mountains in western Riverside County. The Santa Ynez Mountains make up the westernmost ranges, extending from Point Conception to the Ventura River just west-northwest of Ojai, in Ventura County. Pine Mountain Ridge, Nordhoff Ridge\u2013Topatopa Mountains, Rincon Peak\u2013Red Mountain, Sulphur Mountain, Santa Paula Ridge, South Mountain\u2013Oat Mountain\u2013Santa Susana Mountains, Simi Hills, Conejo Mountains\u2013Santa Monica Mountains are all part of the Western Transverse Ranges, in Ventura and western Los Angeles counties.\n\n\nThe Liebre Mountains occupy the northwest corner of Los Angeles County, and represent a northwestern extension of the San Gabriel Mountains, both on the Pacific Plate side of the San Andreas Fault. The fault divides the San Gabriel Mountains from the San Bernardino Mountains further to the east in San Bernardino County.\n\n\nIt is possible to surf in the Pacific Ocean and ski on a mountain during the same winter day in Southern California.\n\n\n\n### Mojave Desert[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Badwater Basin: the lowest point in North America at \u2212279 feet (\u221285\u00a0m).\nThere are harsh deserts in the Southeast of California. These deserts are caused by a combination of the cold offshore current, which limits evaporation, and the rain shadow of the mountains. The prevailing winds blow from the ocean inland. When the air passes over the mountains, adiabatic cooling causes most water in the air to rain on the mountains. When the air returns to sea level on the other side of the mountains, it recompresses, warms and dries, parching the deserts. When the wind blows from inland, the resulting hot dry katabatic winds are called the Santa Ana Winds.\n\n\nThe Mojave Desert is bounded by the peninsular Tehachapi Mountains on the Northwest, together with the San Gabriel and the San Bernardino Mountains on the Southwest. These Western boundaries are quite distinct, forming the dominant pie-slice shaped Antelope Valley in Southern California. The outlines of this valley are caused by the two largest faults in California: the San Andreas and the Garlock. The Mojave Desert extends Eastward into the State of Nevada. The Mojave Desert receives less than 6\u00a0inches (150\u00a0mm) of rain a year and is generally between 3,000 and 6,000 feet (1,000 and 2,000 m) of elevation. Areas such as the Antelope Valley desert which is a high desert received snow each year, in the past it could snow 2\u20133 times a year; however, recently snow level has declined significantly to once a year or less. Most of the towns and cities in the California portion of the Mojave are relatively small, except for Palmdale and Lancaster. However, some are quite famous like Barstow, a popular stop on the famous U.S. Route 66. The Mojave Desert also contains the lowest, hottest place in the Americas: Death Valley, where temperature normally approaches 120\u00a0\u00b0F (49\u00a0\u00b0C), in late July and early August.\n\n\n\n### Peninsular Ranges[edit]\n\n\nThe southernmost mountains of California are the Peninsular Ranges, which are east of San Diego and continue into Baja California (Mexico) in the Sierra San Pedro Martir. The Peninsular Ranges contain the Laguna Mountains, the San Jacinto Mountains, the Santa Rosa Mountains, the Santa Ana Mountains and the Palomar Mountain Range, notable for its famous Palomar observatory. San Jacinto Peak's eastern shoulder has a cable tram that runs from the desert floor to nearly the top of the mountain where riders can set off hiking or go cross-country skiing.\n\n\n\n### Colorado Desert[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Coachella Valley Preserve\nTo the east of the peninsular ranges lie the Colorado and Sonoran Deserts, which extend into Arizona and Mexico.\n\n\nThe ground elevation is generally lower and in some areas was compressed downward, therefore the eastern Coachella and Imperial Valleys north of the U.S.-Mexican border are below sea level. The lowest community in the U.S. is Calipatria, California, at 180 feet (55\u00a0m) below sea level.[17]\n\n\nOne feature of the desert is the Salton Sea, an inland lake that was formed in 1905 when a swollen Colorado River breached a canal near the U.S.-Mexico border and flowed into the Salton Sink (Salton Basin) for almost two years. Today, the Salton Sea, a new version of historic Lake Cahuilla, remains as California's largest lake.\n\n\n\n## Pacific Ocean[edit]\n\n\nThe Pacific Ocean lies to the west of California. Owing to the long length of the state, Sea temperatures generally range from 50\u00a0\u00b0F (10\u00a0\u00b0C) in the northernmost parts during winter to 70\u00a0\u00b0F (21\u00a0\u00b0C) in the south coast during summer. The lower seasonal temperature variance compared to the waters of the East Coast is because of up-welling deep waters with dissolved nutrients. Therefore, sea life in and around California has examples of both Arctic and tropical, biotopes, leaning more towards the latter in the south coast and vice versa. The sea off California is remarkably fertile, a murky green filled with a massive variety of fish, rather than the clear dead blue of most tropical seas. Before 1930, there was an extremely valuable sardine (herring) fishery off Monterey, but this was depleted, an event later famous as the background to John Steinbeck's *Cannery Row*.\n\n\nCalifornia's coastline is about 840 miles long, the third longest coastline in the United States after Alaska and Florida.\n\n\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geology of California\n\n### Faults, volcanoes, and tsunamis[edit]\n\n\nEarthquakes occur due to faults that run the length of the Pacific coast, the largest being the San Andreas Fault. Major historical earthquakes include, with the magnitudes listed:\n\n\n\n* 1906 San Francisco earthquake (magnitude 7.8\u20138.2)\n* 1971 San Fernando earthquake (magnitude 6.6)\n* 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake (magnitude 6.9\u20137.1)\n* 1994 Northridge earthquake (magnitude 6.7)\n\n\nCoastal cities are vulnerable to tsunamis from locally generated earthquakes as well as those elsewhere in the Pacific Ring of Fire. The Great Chilean earthquake tsunami (1960) killed one person and caused $500,000 to $1,000,000 dollars of damage in Los Angeles, damaged harbors in many coastal cities, and flooded streets in Crescent City.[18] Waves from the Alaskan Good Friday earthquake of 1964 killed twelve people in Crescent City and caused damage as far south as Los Angeles. USGS has released the UCERF California earthquake forecast which models earthquake occurrence in California.\n\n\nCalifornia is also home to several volcanoes, including Lassen Peak, which erupted in 1914 and 1921, and Mount Shasta.\n\n\n\n### Tectonics[edit]\n\n\nCalifornia, when only partially explored by the Spanish, was once thought to be an island, as when the southern Baja California Peninsula is approached from the Gulf of California the land appears to the west. It is expected, through the motions of plate tectonics that the sea floor spreading now acting in the Gulf of California (also known as the Sea of Cortez) will eventually extend through Southern California and along the San Andreas fault to below San Francisco, finally forming a long island in less than 150 million years. (For comparison, this is also the approximate age of the Atlantic Ocean.) Predictions suggest that this island will eventually collide with Alaska after an additional 100 million years.\n\n\n\n![](image)California map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification.\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of California\n\nCalifornia's climate varies widely, from arid to subarctic, depending on latitude, elevation, and proximity to the coast. Coastal and Southern parts of the state have a Subtropical Mediterranean climate, with somewhat rainy winters and dry summers. The influence of the ocean generally moderates temperature extremes, creating warmer winters and substantially cooler summers, especially along the coastal areas.\n\n\nThe state is subject to coastal storms during the winter. Eastern California is subject to summertime thunderstorms caused by the North American monsoon. Dry weather during the rest of the year produces conditions favorable to wildfires. California hurricanes occur less frequently than their counterparts on the Atlantic Ocean. Higher elevations experience snowstorms in the winter months.\n\n\nFloods are occasionally caused by heavy rain, storms, and snowmelt. Steep slopes and unstable soil make certain locations vulnerable to landslides in wet weather or during earthquakes.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Deserts of California\n* Ecology of California\n* List of California 14,000-foot summits\n* List of California state parks\n* List of forts in California\n* List of lakes in California\n* List of mountain peaks of California\n* List of mountain ranges of California\n* List of regions of California\n* List of rivers of California\n* List of the major 3000-meter summits of California\n* List of islands of California\n* List of lakes of California\n* List of beaches in California\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Barnard, Jeff (May 19, 1985). \"California\u2013Oregon Dispute\u00a0: Border Fight Has Townfolk on Edge\". *Los Angeles Times*.\n2. **^** \"Klamath Mountains\". *Peakbagger*.

It borders North Dakota and South Dakota to the east. Wyoming is to the south, Idaho is to the west and southwest, and the Canadian provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan are to the north, making it the only state to border three Canadian provinces.\n\n\nWith an area of 147,040 square miles (380,800\u00a0km2),[1] Montana is slightly larger than Japan. It is the fourth-largest state in the United States after Alaska, Texas, and California,[2] and the largest landlocked state.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Topography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Relief map of Montana\nThe state's topography is roughly defined by the Continental Divide, which splits much of the state into distinct eastern and western regions.[4] Most of Montana's hundred or more named mountain ranges are in the state's western half, most of which is geologically and geographically part of the northern Rocky Mountains.[4][5] The Absaroka and Beartooth ranges in the state's south-central part are technically part of the Central Rocky Mountains.[6] The Rocky Mountain Front is a significant feature in the state's north-central portion,[7] and isolated island ranges that interrupt the prairie landscape common in the central and eastern parts of the state.[8] About 60 percent of the state is prairie, part of the northern Great Plains.[9]\n\n\nThe Bitterroot Mountains\u2014one of the longest continuous ranges in the Rocky Mountain chain from Alaska to Mexico[10]\u2014along with smaller ranges, including the Coeur d'Alene Mountains and the Cabinet Mountains, divide the state from Idaho. The southern third of the Bitterroot range blends into the Continental Divide.[11] Other major mountain ranges west of the divide include the Cabinet Mountains, the Anaconda Range, the Missions, the Garnet Range, the Sapphire Mountains, and the Flint Creek Range.[12]\n\n\nThe divide's northern section, where the mountains rapidly give way to prairie, is part of the Rocky Mountain Front.[13] The front is most pronounced in the Lewis Range, located primarily in Glacier National Park.[14] Due to the configuration of mountain ranges in Glacier National Park, the Northern Divide (which begins in Alaska's Seward Peninsula)[15] crosses this region and turns east in Montana at Triple Divide Peak.[16] It causes the Waterton River, Belly, and Saint Mary rivers to flow north into Alberta, Canada.[17] There they join the Saskatchewan River, which ultimately empties into Hudson Bay.[18]\n\n\nEast of the divide, several roughly parallel ranges cover the state's southern part, including the Gravelly Range, Madison Range, Gallatin Range, Absaroka Mountains, and Beartooth Mountains.[19] The Beartooth Plateau is the largest continuous land mass over 10,000 feet (3,000\u00a0m) high in the continental United States.[20] It contains the state's highest point, Granite Peak, 12,799 feet (3,901\u00a0m) high.[20] North of these ranges are the Big Belt Mountains, Bridger Mountains, Tobacco Roots, and several island ranges, including the Crazy Mountains and Little Belt Mountains.[21]\n\n\n\n![](image)Saint Mary Lake in Glacier National Park\n![](image)Belly River in Waterton Lakes National Park\nBetween many mountain ranges are several rich river valleys. The Big Hole Valley,[22] Bitterroot Valley,[23] Gallatin Valley,[24] Flathead Valley,[25][26] and Paradise Valley[27] have extensive agricultural resources and multiple opportunities for tourism and recreation.\n\n\nEast and north of this transition zone are the expansive and sparsely populated Northern Plains, with tableland prairies, smaller island mountain ranges, and badlands.[28] The isolated island ranges east of the Divide include the Bear Paw Mountains,[29] Bull Mountains,[30] Castle Mountains,[31] Crazy Mountains,[32] Highwood Mountains,[33] Judith Mountains,[33] Little Belt Mountains,[31] Little Rocky Mountains,[33] the Pryor Mountains,[32] Little Snowy Mountains, Big Snowy Mountains,[30] Sweet Grass Hills,[30] and\u2014in the state's southeastern corner near Ekalaka\u2014the Long Pines.[5] Many of these isolated eastern ranges were created about 120 to 66\u00a0million years ago when magma welling up from the interior cracked and bowed the earth's surface here.[34]\n\n\nThe area east of the divide in the state's north-central portion is known for the Missouri Breaks and other significant rock formations.[35] Three buttes south of Great Falls are major landmarks: Cascade, Crown, Square, Shaw, and Buttes.[36] Known as laccoliths, they formed when igneous rock protruded through cracks in the sedimentary rock.[36] The underlying surface consists of sandstone and shale.[37] Surface soils in the area are highly diverse, and greatly affected by the local geology, whether glaciated plain, intermountain basin, mountain foothills, or tableland.[38] Foothill regions are often covered in weathered stone or broken slate, or consist of uncovered bare rock (usually igneous, quartzite, sandstone, or shale).[39] The soil of intermountain basins usually consists of clay, gravel, sand, silt, and volcanic ash, much of it laid down by lakes which covered the region during the Oligocene 33 to 23\u00a0million years ago.[40] Tablelands are often topped with argillite gravel and weathered quartzite, occasionally underlain by shale.[41] The glaciated plains are generally covered in clay, gravel, sand, and silt left by the proglacial Lake Great Falls or by moraines or gravel-covered former lake basins left by the Wisconsin glaciation 85,000 to 11,000 years ago.[42] Farther east, areas such as Makoshika State Park near Glendive and Medicine Rocks State Park near Ekalaka contain some of the most scenic badlands regions in the state.[43]\n\n\nThe Hell Creek Formation in Northeast Montana is a major source of dinosaur fossils.[44] Paleontologist Jack Horner of the Museum of the Rockies in Bozeman brought this formation to the world's attention with several major finds.[45]\n\n\n\n### Rivers, lakes and reservoirs[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of rivers of Montana and List of lakes in Montana\n\nMontana has thousands of named rivers and creeks,[46] 450 miles (720\u00a0km) of which are known for \"blue-ribbon\" trout fishing.[47][48] Montana's water resources provide for recreation, hydropower, crop and forage irrigation, mining, and water for human consumption.\n\n\nMontana is one of few geographic areas in the world whose rivers form parts of three major watersheds (i.e. where two continental divides intersect). Its rivers feed the Pacific Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico, and Hudson Bay. The watersheds divide at Triple Divide Peak in Glacier National Park.[49] If Hudson Bay is considered part of the Arctic Ocean, Triple Divide Peak is the only place on Earth with drainage to three different oceans.\n\n\n\n#### Pacific Ocean drainage basin[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Missouri Breaks region in central Montana\nAll waters in Montana west of the divide flow into the Columbia River. The Clark Fork of the Columbia (not to be confused with the Clarks Fork of the Yellowstone River) rises near Butte[50] and flows northwest to Missoula, where it is joined by the Blackfoot River and Bitterroot River.[51] Farther downstream, it is joined by the Flathead River before entering Idaho near Lake Pend Oreille.[17][52] The Pend Oreille River forms the outflow of Lake Pend Oreille. The Pend Oreille River joined the Columbia River, which flows to the Pacific Ocean\u2014making the 579-mile (932\u00a0km) long Clark Fork/Pend Oreille (considered a single river system) the longest river in the Rocky Mountains.[53] The Clark Fork discharges the greatest volume of water of any river exiting the state.[54] The Kootenai River in northwest Montana is another major tributary of the Columbia.[55]\n\n\n\n#### Gulf of Mexico drainage basin[edit]\n\n\nEast of the divide the Missouri River, which is formed by the confluence of the Jefferson, Madison, and Gallatin Rivers near Three Forks,[56] flows due north through the west-central part of the state to Great Falls.[57] From this point, it then flows generally east through fairly flat agricultural land and the Missouri Breaks to Fort Peck reservoir.[58] The stretch of river between Fort Benton and the Fred Robinson Bridge at the western boundary of Fort Peck Reservoir was designated a National Wild and Scenic River in 1976.[58] The Missouri enters North Dakota near Fort Union,[59] having drained more than half the land area of Montana (82,000 square miles (210,000\u00a0km2)).[57] Nearly one-third of the Missouri River in Montana lies behind 10 dams: Toston, Canyon Ferry, Hauser, Holter, Black Eagle, Rainbow, Cochrane, Ryan, Morony, and Fort Peck.[60] Other major Montana tributaries of the Missouri include the Smith,[61] Milk,[62] Marias,[63] Judith,[64] and Musselshell Rivers.[65] Montana also claims the disputed title of possessing the world's shortest river, the Roe River, just outside Great Falls.[66] Through the Missouri, these rivers ultimately join the Mississippi River and flow into the Gulf of Mexico.[67]\n\n\nHell Roaring Creek begins in southern Montana, and when combined with the Red Rock, Beaverhead, Jefferson, Missouri, and Mississippi River, is the longest river in North America and the fourth longest river in the world.\n\n\nThe Yellowstone River rises on the Continental Divide near Younts Peak in Wyoming's Teton Wilderness.[68] It flows north through Yellowstone National Park, enters Montana near Gardiner, and passes through the Paradise Valley to Livingston.[69] It then flows northeasterly[69] across the state through Billings, Miles City, Glendive, and Sidney.[70] The Yellowstone joins the Missouri in North Dakota just east of Fort Union.[71] It is the longest undammed, free-flowing river in the contiguous United States,[72][73] and drains about a quarter of Montana (36,000 square miles (93,000\u00a0km2)).[57] Major tributaries of the Yellowstone include the Boulder,[74] Stillwater,[75] Clarks Fork,[76] Bighorn,[77] Tongue,[78] and Powder Rivers.[79]\n\n\n\n#### Hudson Bay drainage basin[edit]\n\n\nThe Northern Divide turns east in Montana at Triple Divide Peak, causing the Waterton, Belly, and Saint Mary Rivers to flow north into Alberta. There they join the Saskatchewan River, which ultimately empties into Hudson Bay.[18]\n\n\n\n#### Lakes and reservoirs[edit]\n\n\nMontana has some 3,000 named lakes and reservoirs, including Flathead Lake, the largest natural freshwater lake in the western United States. Other major lakes include Whitefish Lake in the Flathead Valley and Lake McDonald and St. Mary Lake in Glacier National Park. The largest reservoir in the state is Fort Peck Reservoir on the Missouri river, which is contained by the second largest earthen dam and largest hydraulically filled dam in the world.[80] Other major reservoirs include Hungry Horse on the Flathead River; Lake Koocanusa on the Kootenai River; Lake Elwell on the Marias River; Clark Canyon on the Beaverhead River; Yellowtail on the Bighorn River, Canyon Ferry, Hauser, Holter, Rainbow; and Black Eagle on the Missouri River.\n\n\n\n## Flora and fauna[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of monocotyledons of Montana, List of coniferous plants of Montana, List of lichens of Montana, List of amphibians and reptiles of Montana, List of birds of Montana, Fish of Montana, and Mammals of Montana\n\n![](image)100 pound native Montana wolf taken in 1928\nVegetation of the state includes lodgepole pine, ponderosa pine, Douglas fir, larch, spruce, aspen, birch, red cedar, hemlock, ash, alder, rocky mountain maple and cottonwood trees. Forests cover about 25% of the state. Flowers native to Montana include asters, bitterroots, daisies, lupins, poppies, primroses, columbine, lilies, orchids, and dryads. Several species of sagebrush and cactus and many species of grasses are common. Many species of mushrooms and lichens[81] are also found in the state.\n\n\nMontana is home to diverse fauna including 14 amphibian,[82] 90 fish,[83] 117 mammal,[84] 20 reptile,[85] and 427 bird[86] species. Additionally, more than 10,000 invertebrate species are present, including 180 mollusks and 30 crustaceans. Montana has the largest grizzly bear population in the lower 48 states.[87] Montana hosts five federally endangered species\u2013black-footed ferret, whooping crane, least tern, pallid sturgeon, and white sturgeon and seven threatened species including the grizzly bear, Canadian lynx, and bull trout.[88][a] Since re-introduction the gray wolf population has stabilized at about 900 animals, and they have been delisted as endangered.[89] The Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks manages fishing and hunting seasons for at least 17 species of game fish, including seven species of trout, walleye, and smallmouth bass[90] and at least 29 species of game birds and animals including ring-neck pheasant, grey partridge, elk, pronghorn antelope, mule deer, whitetail deer, gray wolf, and bighorn sheep.[91]\n\n\n\n## Protected areas[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Montana state parks\n\n![](image)Pompeys Pillar National Monument\nMontana contains Glacier National Park, \"The Crown of the Continent\"; and parts of Yellowstone National Park, including three of the park's five entrances. Other federally recognized sites include the Little Bighorn National Monument, Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area, and Big Hole National Battlefield. The CSKT Bison Range is managed by the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes and the American Prairie is owned and operated by a non-profit organization.\n\n\nFederal and state agencies administer approximately 31,300,000 acres (127,000\u00a0km2), or 35 percent of Montana's land. The U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service administers 16,800,000 acres (68,000\u00a0km2) of forest land in ten National Forests. There are approximately 3,300,000 acres (13,000\u00a0km2) of wilderness in 12 separate wilderness areas that are part of the National Wilderness Preservation System established by the Wilderness Act of 1964. The U.S. Department of the Interior Bureau of Land Management controls 8,100,000 acres (33,000\u00a0km2) of federal land. The U.S. Department of the Interior Fish and Wildlife Service administers 110,000 acres (450\u00a0km2) of 1.1\u00a0million acres of National Wildlife Refuges and waterfowl production areas in Montana. The U.S. Department of the Interior Bureau of Reclamation administers approximately 300,000 acres (1,200\u00a0km2) of land and water surface in the state. The Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks operate approximately 275,265 acres (1,113.96\u00a0km2) of state parks and access points on the state's rivers and lakes. The Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation manages 5,200,000 acres (21,000\u00a0km2) of School Trust Land ceded by the federal government under the Land Ordinance of 1785 to the state in 1889 when Montana was granted statehood. These lands are managed by the state for the benefit of public schools and institutions in the state.[92]\n\n\n\n![](image)Quake Lake was created by a landslide during the 1959 Hebgen Lake earthquake.\nAreas managed by the National Park Service include:[93]\n\n\n\n* Big Hole National Battlefield near Wisdom\n* Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area near Fort Smith\n* Glacier National Park\n* Grant-Kohrs Ranch National Historic Site at Deer Lodge\n* Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail\n* Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument near Crow Agency\n* Nez Perce National Historical Park\n* Yellowstone National Park\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Temperature and precipitation for Montana's capital city, Helena\n![](image)K\u00f6ppen climate types of Montana, using 1991-2020 climate normals.\nMontana is a large state with considerable variation in geography, topography and elevation, and the climate is equally varied. The state spans from below the 45th parallel (the line equidistant between the equator and North Pole) to the 49th parallel, and elevations range from under 2,000 feet (610\u00a0m) to nearly 13,000 feet (4,000\u00a0m) above sea level. The western half is mountainous, interrupted by numerous large valleys. Eastern Montana comprises plains and badlands, broken by hills and isolated mountain ranges, and has a semi-arid, continental climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification *BSk*). The Continental Divide has a considerable effect on the climate, as it restricts the flow of warmer air from the Pacific from moving east, and drier continental air from moving west. The area west of the divide has a modified northern Pacific Coast climate, with milder winters, cooler summers, less wind, and a longer growing season.[94] Low clouds and fog often form in the valleys west of the divide in winter, but this is rarely seen in the east.[95]\n\n\nAverage daytime temperatures vary from 28\u00a0\u00b0F or \u22122.2\u00a0\u00b0C in January to 84.5\u00a0\u00b0F or 29.2\u00a0\u00b0C in July.[96][*verification needed*] The variation in geography leads to great variation in temperature. The highest observed summer temperature was 117\u00a0\u00b0F or 47.2\u00a0\u00b0C at Glendive on July 20, 1893, and Medicine Lake on July 5, 1937. Throughout the state, summer nights are generally cool and pleasant. Extreme hot weather is less common above 4,000 feet or 1,200 meters.[94] Snowfall has been recorded in all months of the year in the more mountainous areas of central and western Montana, though it is rare in July and August.[94]\n\n\nThe coldest temperature on record for Montana is also the coldest temperature for the contiguous United States. On January 20, 1954, \u221270\u00a0\u00b0F or \u221256.7\u00a0\u00b0C was recorded at a gold mining camp near Rogers Pass. Temperatures vary greatly on cold nights, and Helena, 40 miles (64\u00a0km) to the southeast had a low of only \u221236\u00a0\u00b0F or \u221237.8\u00a0\u00b0C on the same date, and an all-time record low of \u221242\u00a0\u00b0F or \u221241.1\u00a0\u00b0C.[94] Winter cold spells are usually the result of cold continental air coming south from Canada. The front is often well defined, causing a large temperature drop in a 24-hour period. Conversely, air flow from the southwest results in \"chinooks\". These steady 25\u201350\u00a0mph (40\u201380\u00a0km/h) (or more) winds can suddenly warm parts of Montana, especially areas just to the east of the mountains, where temperatures sometimes rise up to 50\u201360\u00a0\u00b0F (10.0\u201315.6\u00a0\u00b0C) for 10 days or longer.[94][97]\n\n\nLoma is the site of the most extreme recorded temperature change in a 24-hour period in the United States. On January 15, 1972, a chinook wind blew in and the temperature rose from \u221254 to 49\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221247.8 to 9.4\u00a0\u00b0C).[98] Miles City recorded the highest mean sea level pressure in the United States on December 24, 1983.[99]\n\n\n\n![](image)Clark Fork River, Missoula, in autumn\nAverage annual precipitation is 15 inches (380\u00a0mm), but great variations are seen. The mountain ranges block the moist Pacific air, holding moisture in the western valleys, and creating rain shadows to the east. Heron, in the west, receives the most precipitation, 34.70 inches (881\u00a0mm). On the eastern (leeward) side of a mountain range, the valleys are much drier; Lonepine averages 11.45 inches (291\u00a0mm), and Deer Lodge 11.00 inches (279\u00a0mm) of precipitation. The mountains can receive over 100 inches (2,500\u00a0mm), for example the Grinnell Glacier in Glacier National Park gets 105 inches (2,700\u00a0mm).[95] An area southwest of Belfry averaged only 6.59 inches (167\u00a0mm) over a 16-year period. Most of the larger cities get 30 to 50 inches or 0.76 to 1.27 meters of snow each year. Mountain ranges can accumulate 300 inches or 7.62 meters of snow during a winter. Heavy snowstorms may occur from September through May, though most snow falls from November to March.[94]\n\n\nThe climate has become warmer in Montana[*when?*] and continues to do so.[100] The glaciers in Glacier National Park have receded and are predicted to melt away completely in a few decades.[101] Many Montana cities set heat records during July 2007, the hottest month ever recorded in Montana.[100][102] Winters are warmer, too, and have fewer cold spells. Previously, these cold spells had killed off bark beetles, but these are now attacking the forests of western Montana.[103][104] The warmer winters in the region have allowed various species to expand their ranges and proliferate.[105] The combination of warmer weather, attack by beetles, and mismanagement has led to a substantial increase in the severity of forest fires in Montana.[100][104] According to a study done for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency by the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Science, parts of Montana will experience a 200% increase in area burned by wildfires and an 80% increase in related air pollution.[106][107]\n\n\nThe table below lists average temperatures for the warmest and coldest month for Montana's seven largest cities. The coldest month varies between December and January depending on location, although figures are similar throughout.\n\n\n\n### Climate data[edit]\n\n\n\n\nAverage daily maximum and minimum

The Kerguelen Islands are antipodal to the Montana\u2013Saskatchewan\u2013Alberta border. No towns are precisely antipodal to Kerguelen, though Chester and Rudyard are close.[116]\n\n\n\n## Cities and towns[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of cities and towns in Montana and List of counties in Montana\n\n![](image)Missoula, the second-largest city in Montana\nMontana has 56 counties and a total of 364 \"places\" as defined by the United States Census Bureau; the latter comprising 129 incorporated places and 235 census-designated places. The incorporated places are made up of 52 cities, 75 towns, and two consolidated city-counties.[117]\n\n\nMontana has one city, Billings, with a population over 100,000; and three cities with populations over 50,000: Missoula, Great Falls and Bozeman. The state also has five Micropolitan Statistical Areas, centered on Bozeman, Butte, Helena, Kalispell and Havre.[118]\n\n\nCollectively all of these areas (excluding Havre) are known informally as the \"big seven\", as they are consistently the seven largest communities in the state (their rank order in terms of population is Billings, Missoula, Great Falls, Bozeman, Butte, Helena and Kalispell, according to the 2010 U.S. Census).[119] Based on 2013 census numbers, they contain 35 percent of Montana's population,[120] and the counties in which they are located are home to 62 percent of the state's population.[121]\n\n\nThe geographic center of population of Montana is in sparsely populated Meagher County, in the town of White Sulphur Springs.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Regional designations of Montana\n* Ecological systems of Montana\n* List of mountain ranges in Montana\n* List of forests in Montana\n* Geography of Alberta\n* Geography of Idaho\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** However, the grizzly bear and Canadian lynx are listed as a threatened species only for the mainland 48 states.

Its eastern border lies along 103\u00b0W longitude with the state of Oklahoma, and 2.2 miles (3.5 kilometres) west of 103\u00b0W longitude with Texas (due to a 19th-century surveying error).[2][3] On the southern border, Texas makes up the eastern two-thirds, while the Mexican states of Chihuahua and Sonora make up the western third, with Chihuahua making up about 90% of that. The western border with Arizona runs along the 109\u00b0 03'W longitude.[4] The southwestern corner of the state is known as the Bootheel. The 37\u00b0N parallel forms the northern boundary with Colorado. The states of New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona, and Utah come together at the Four Corners in New Mexico's northwestern corner. Its surface water area is about 292 square miles (760\u00a0km2).[1]\n\n\nDespite its popular depiction as mostly arid desert, New Mexico has one of the most diverse landscapes of any U.S. state, ranging from wide, auburn-colored deserts and verdant grasslands, to broken mesas and high, snow-capped peaks.[5] Close to a third of the state is covered in timberland, with heavily forested mountain wildernesses dominating the north. The Sangre de Cristo Mountains, the southernmost part of the Rocky Mountains, run roughly north\u2013south along the east side of the Rio Grande, in the rugged, pastoral north. The Great Plains extend into the eastern third of the state, most notably the Llano Estacado (\"Staked Plain\"), whose westernmost boundary is marked by the Mescalero Ridge escarpment. The northwestern quadrant of New Mexico is dominated by the Colorado Plateau, characterized by unique volcanic formations, dry grasslands and shrublands, open pinyon-juniper woodland, and mountain forests.[6] The Chihuahuan Desert, which is the largest in North America, extends through the south.\n\n\nOver four\u2013fifths of New Mexico is higher than 4,000 feet (1,200 meters) above sea level. The average elevation ranges from up to 8,000 feet (2,400 meters) above sea level in the northwest, to less than 4,000 feet in the southeast.[5] The highest point is Wheeler Peak at over 13,160 feet (4,010 meters) in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, while the lowest is the Red Bluff Reservoir at around 2,840 feet (870 meters), in the southeastern corner of the state.\n\n\nIn addition to the Rio Grande, which is tied for the fourth-longest river in the U.S., New Mexico has four other major river systems: the Pecos, Canadian, San Juan, and Gila.[7] Nearly bisecting New Mexico from north to south, the Rio Grande has played an influential role in the region's history; its fertile floodplain has supported human habitation since prehistoric times, and European settlers initially lived exclusively in its valleys and along its tributaries.[5] The Pecos, which flows roughly parallel to the Rio Grande at its east, was a popular route for explorers, as was the Canadian River, which rises in the mountainous north and flows east across the arid plains. The San Juan and Gila lie west of the Continental Divide, in the northwest and southwest, respectively. With the exception of the Gila, all major rivers are dammed in New Mexico and provide a major water source for irrigation and flood control.\n\n\nAside from its rivers, New Mexico has few sizeable natural bodies of water; there are several artificial lakes and reservoirs, the largest being Elephant Butte Reservoir, which was created by the damming of the Rio Grande. At its height in the early 20th century, the reservoir was the largest man-made lake in the world.[8]\n\n\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)K\u00f6ppen climate types of New Mexico, using 1991-2020 climate normals\nNew Mexico has long been known for its dry, temperate climate.[5] Overall the state is semi-arid to arid, with areas of continental and alpine climates at higher elevations. New Mexico's statewide average precipitation is 13.7 inches (350\u00a0mm) a year, with average monthly amounts peaking in the summer, particularly in the more rugged north-central area around Albuquerque and in the south. Generally, the eastern third of the state receives the most rainfall, while the western third receives the least. Higher altitudes receive around 40 inches (1,000\u00a0mm), while the lowest elevations see as little as 8 to 10 inches (200 to 250 millimetres).[5]\n\n\nAnnual temperatures can range from 65\u00a0\u00b0F (18\u00a0\u00b0C) in the southeast to below 40\u00a0\u00b0F (4\u00a0\u00b0C) in the northern mountains,[4] with the average being the mid-50s \u00b0F (12\u00a0\u00b0C). During the summer, daytime temperatures can often exceed 100\u00a0\u00b0F (38\u00a0\u00b0C) at elevations below 5,000 feet (1,500\u00a0m); the average high temperature in July ranges from 99\u00a0\u00b0F (37\u00a0\u00b0C) at the lower elevations down to 78\u00a0\u00b0F (26\u00a0\u00b0C) at the higher elevations. In the colder months of November to March, many cities in New Mexico can have nighttime temperature lows in the teens above zero, or lower. The highest temperature recorded in New Mexico was 122\u00a0\u00b0F (50\u00a0\u00b0C) at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) near Loving on June 27, 1994; the lowest recorded temperature is \u221250\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221246\u00a0\u00b0C) at Gavilan (near Lindrith) on February 1, 1951.[9]\n\n\nNew Mexico's stable climate and sparse population provides for clearer skies and less light pollution, making it a popular site for several major astronomical observatories, including the Apache Point Observatory, the Very Large Array, and the Magdalena Ridge Observatory, among others.[10][11]\n\n\n\n### Climate data[edit]\n\n\n| Climate data for New Mexico (general)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n |

distinct vegetation zones that provide diverse sets of habitats for many plants and animals.[20] The Upper Sonoran Zone is by far the most prominent, constituting about three-fourths of the state; it includes most of the plains, foothills, and valleys above 4,500 feet, and is defined by prairie grasses, low pi\u00f1on pines, and juniper shrubs. The Llano Estacado in the east features shortgrass prairie with blue grama, which sustain bison. The Chihuahuan Desert in the south is characterized by shrubby creosote. The Colorado Plateau in the northwest corner of New Mexico is high desert with cold winters, featuring sagebrush, shadescale, greasewood, and other plants adapted to the saline and seleniferous soil.\n\n\nThe mountainous north hosts a wide array of vegetation types corresponding to elevation gradients, such as pi\u00f1on-juniper woodlands near the base, through evergreen conifers, spruce-fir and aspen forests in the transitionary zone, and Krummholz, and alpine tundra at the very top.[20] The Apachian zone tucked into the southwestern bootheel of the state has high-calcium soil, oak woodlands, Arizona cypress, and other plants that are not found in other parts of the state.[21][22] The southern sections of the Rio Grande and Pecos valleys have 20,000 square miles (52,000 square kilometres) of New Mexico's best grazing land and irrigated farmland.\n\n\nNew Mexico's varied climate and vegetation zones consequently support diverse wildlife. Black bears, bighorn sheep, bobcats, cougars, deer, and elk live in habitats above 7,000 feet, while coyotes, jackrabbits, kangaroo rats, javelina, porcupines, pronghorn antelope, western diamondbacks, and wild turkeys live in less mountainous and elevated regions.[23][24][25] The iconic roadrunner, which is the state bird, is abundant in the southeast. Endangered species include the Mexican gray wolf, which is being gradually reintroduced in the world, and Rio Grande silvery minnow.[26] Over 500 species of birds live or migrate through New Mexico, third only to California and Mexico.[27]\n\n\n\n## Conservation[edit]\n\n\nNew Mexico and 12 other western states together account for 93% of all federally owned land in the U.S. Roughly one\u2013third of the state, or 24.7 million of 77.8 million acres, is held by the U.S. government, the tenth-highest percentage in the country. More than half this land is under the Bureau of Land Management, while another third is managed by the U.S. Forest Service.\n\n\nNew Mexico was central to the early\u201320th century conservation movement, with Gila Wilderness being designated the world's first wilderness area in 1924.[28] The state also hosts nine of the country's 84 national monuments, the most of any state after Arizona; these include the second oldest monument, El Morro, which was created in 1906, and the Gila Cliff Dwellings, proclaimed in 1907.[28]\n\n\n\n\n\nNational Forests **in New Mexico**[29]\n| Carson National Forest | ![](image) |\n| Cibola National Forest | ![](image) |\n| Lincoln National Forest | ![](image) |\n| Santa Fe National Forest | ![](image) |\n| Gila National Forest | ![](image) |\n| Gila Wilderness | ![](image) |\n| Coronado National Forest (in Hidalgo County)\n | ![](image) |\n\n\nAreas managed by the National Park Service include:[30]\n\n\n\n* Aztec Ruins National Monument at Aztec\n* Bandelier National Monument in Los Alamos\n* Capulin Volcano National Monument near Capulin\n* Carlsbad Caverns National Park near Carlsbad\n* Chaco Culture National Historical Park at Nageezi\n* El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro National Historic Trail\n* El Malpais National Monument in Grants\n* El Morro National Monument in Ramah\n* Fort Union National Monument at Watrous\n* Gila Cliff Dwellings National Monument near Silver City\n* Kasha-Katuwe Tent Rocks National Monument[31]\n* Old Spanish National Historic Trail\n* Organ Mountains\u00a0\u2013 Desert Peaks National Monument near Las Cruces\n* Manhattan Project National Historical Park\n* Pecos National Historical Park in Pecos\n* Petroglyph National Monument near Albuquerque\n* Salinas Pueblo Missions National Monument at Mountainair\n* Santa Fe National Historic Trail\n* White Sands National Park near Alamogordo\n* Rio Grande del Norte National Monument near Taos\n* Valles Caldera National Preserve in the Jemez Mountains\n\nNational Wildlife Refuges in New Mexico managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service include:\n\n\n\n* Bitter Lake National Wildlife Refuge\n* Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge\n* Grulla National Wildlife Refuge\n* Las Vegas National Wildlife Refuge\n* Maxwell National Wildlife Refuge\n* San Andres National Wildlife Refuge\n* Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge\n* Valle de Oro National Wildlife Refuge in the City of Albuquerque's South Valley\n\n\nindependent wildlife refuges in New Mexico include:\n\n\n\n* Whitfield Wildlife Conservation Area in Valencia County \u00b7 Whitfield Wildlife Conservation Area \u2013 Valencia Soil and Water Conservation District\n\n\nAreas managed by the New Mexico State Parks Division:[32][Note 1]\n\n\n\n* Bluewater Lake State Park\n* Bottomless Lakes State Park\n* Brantley Lake State Park\n* Cerrillos Hills State Park\n* Caballo Lake State Park\n* Cimarron Canyon State Park\n* City of Rocks State Park\n* Clayton Lake State Park\n* Conchas Lake State Park\n* Coyote Creek State Park\n* Eagle Nest Lake State Park\n* Elephant Butte Lake State Park\n* El Vado Lake State Park\n* Heron Lake State Park\n* Hyde Memorial State Park\n* Leasburg Dam State Park\n* Living Desert Zoo and Gardens State Park\n* Manzano Mountains State Park\n* Mesilla Valley Bosque State Park\n* Morphy Lake State Park\n* Navajo Lake *(Rio Arriba, NM and San Juan, NM)*\n* Oasis State Park\n* Oliver Lee Memorial State Park\n* Pancho Villa State Park\n* Percha Dam State Park\n* Rio Grande Nature Center State Park\n* Rio Grande Valley State Park\n* Rockhound State Park\n* Santa Rosa Lake State Park\n* Storrie Lake State Park\n* Sugarite Canyon State Park\n* Sumner Lake State Park\n* Fenton Lake State Park\n* Ute Lake State Park\n* Villanueva State Park\n\n## Environmental issues[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2016, New Mexico sued the United States Environmental Protection Agency over negligence after the 2015 Gold King Mine waste water spill. The spill had caused heavy metals such as cadmium and lead and toxins such as arsenic to flow into the Animas River, polluting water basins of several states.[33] The state has since implemented or considered stricter regulations and harsher penalties for spills associated with resource extraction.[34]\n\n\nNew Mexico is a major producer of greenhouse gases.[35] A study by Colorado State University showed that the state's oil and gas industry generated 60 million metric tons of greenhouse gases in 2018, over four times greater than previously estimated.[35] The fossil fuels sector accounted for over half the state's overall emissions, which totaled 113.6 million metric tons, about 1.8% of the country's total and more than twice the national average per capita.[35][36] The New Mexico government has responded with efforts to regulate industrial emissions, promote renewable energy, and incentivize the use of electric vehicles.[36][37]\n\n\n\n## Settlements[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of municipalities in New Mexico, List of census-designated places in New Mexico, and List of counties in New Mexico\n\n![](image)New Mexico population density mapWith just 17 people\u00a0per square mile (6.6 people/km2), New Mexico is one of the least densely populated states, ranking 45th out of 50. By contrast, the overall population density of the U.S. is 90/sq\u00a0mi (35/km2). The state is divided into 33 counties and 106 municipalities, which include cities, towns, villages, and a consolidated city-county, Los Alamos. Only two cities have at least 100,000 residents: Albuquerque and Las Cruces, whose respective metropolitan areas together account for the majority of New Mexico's population.\n\n\nResidents are concentrated in the north-central region of New Mexico, anchored by the state's largest city, Albuquerque. Centered in Bernalillo County, the Albuquerque metropolitan area includes New Mexico's third-largest city, Rio Rancho, and has a population of over 918,000, accounting for one-third of all New Mexicans. It is adjacent to Santa Fe, the capital and fourth-largest city. Altogether, the Albuquerque\u2013Santa Fe\u2013Las Vegas combined statistical area includes more than 1.17 million people, or nearly 60% of the state population.\n\n\nNew Mexico's other major center of population is in south-central area around Las Cruces, its second-largest city and the largest city in the southern region of the state. The Las Cruces metropolitan area includes roughly 214,000 residents, but with neighboring El Paso, Texas forms a combined statistical area numbering over 1 million.[38]\n\n\nNew Mexico hosts 23 federally recognized tribal reservations, including part of the Navajo Nation, the largest and most populous tribe; of these, 11 hold off-reservation trust lands elsewhere in the state. The vast majority of federally recognized tribes are concentrated in the northwest, followed by the north-central region.\n\n\nLike several other southwestern states, New Mexico hosts numerous *colonias*, a type of unincorporated, low-income slum characterized by abject poverty, the absence of basic services (such as water and sewage), and scarce housing and infrastructure.[39] The University of New Mexico estimates there are 118 colonias in the state, though the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development identifies roughly 150.[40] The majority are located along the Mexico-U.S. border.\n\n\n\n\n|  Largest cities or towns in New MexicoSource: 2017 U.S. Census Bureau Estimate\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Rank\n | Name | County | Municipal pop.\n |  |\n| ![Albuquerque](image)Albuquerque![Las Cruces](image)Las Cruces | 1 | Albuquerque | Bernalillo | 558,545\n | ![Rio Rancho](image)Rio Rancho![Santa Fe](image)Santa Fe |\n| 2 | Las Cruces | Do\u00f1a Ana | 101,712\n |\n| 3 | Rio Rancho | Sandoval / Bernalillo | 96,159\n |\n| 4 | Santa Fe | Santa Fe | 83,776\n |\n| 5 | Roswell | Chaves | 47,775\n |\n| 6 | Farmington | San Juan | 45,450\n |\n| 7 | Clovis | Curry | 38,962\n |\n| 8 | Hobbs | Lea | 37,764\n |\n| 9 | Alamogordo | Otero | 31,248\n |\n| 10 | Carlsbad | Eddy | 28,774\n |\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Delaware Basin\n* List of counties in New Mexico\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** 1991\u20132020 normals, extremes 1891\u2013present.
