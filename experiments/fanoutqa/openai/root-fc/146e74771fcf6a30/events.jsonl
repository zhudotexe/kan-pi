He also co-founded MixBit.[1] In October 2006, he and Steve Chen sold YouTube for $1.65 billion to Google.[2] Hurley worked in eBay's PayPal division—one of his tasks involved designing the original PayPal logo[3]—before co-founding YouTube[4] with fellow PayPal colleagues Steve Chen and Jawed Karim.[5] Hurley was primarily responsible for the tagging and video-sharing aspects of YouTube.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nHurley was born in Reading, Pennsylvania, the second child of Don and Joann Hurley, and grew up near Birdsboro, Pennsylvania.[7] He has an older sister, Heather, and a younger brother, Brent.[8]\n\n\nSince childhood, Hurley showed interest in the arts, and became interested in computers and electronic media during high school.[9] He was a standout runner for Twin Valley High School's cross-country program, which won two of its PIAA State titles with him as a member in 1992 and 1994. He was also a member of the Technology Student Association during high school. He graduated from Twin Valley High School in 1995 and earned a B.A. in Fine Art from Indiana University of Pennsylvania in 1999.[10]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### YouTube[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hurley in 2007\nHurley founded YouTube in 2005 with Steve Chen and Jawed Karim. On October 16, 2006, Chen and Hurley sold YouTube to Google Inc. (now Google LLC) for $1.65 billion. It was reported in *The Wall Street Journal* that Hurley's share was $345.6M at Google's February 7, 2007, closing stock price of $470.01. He received 694,087 Google shares directly and another 41,232 shares in a trust.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nYouTube's other two co-founders, Steve Chen and Jawed Karim, received 625,366 shares and 137,443 shares, respectively valued at $326.2M and $64.6M. The *Journal*'s report was based on Google's registration statement with SEC filed on February 7, 2007.\n\n\nHurley stepped down as CEO of YouTube in October 2010 and stated he would stay on as an advisor of YouTube, allowing Salar Kamangar to take over the CEO position.[11]\n\n\n\n### MixBit[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2013, Hurley launched another company called MixBit which does video editing using smartphones.[1] According to Steve Chen, it was Chad's idea to turn Avos into MixBit even before the inception of YouTube.[12]\n\n\nThe app resembles other famous short-video recording smartphone apps such as Vine, Instagram and Vyclone. Its limit of recording stretches up to 256 clips, and each clip can be maximum 16 seconds long. It also features the editing tools similar to its other competitor apps.[13]\n\n\n\n### Formula One[edit]\n\n\nHurley was involved as a major investor with US F1 Team, one of the new entrants in Formula One automobile racing for the 2010 season. On March 2, 2010, the team's personnel were dismissed from their duties and the team was unofficially shut down. Neither Hurley, team principal Ken Anderson nor sporting director Peter Windsor would comment on the team's failure to make it to the grid.[14]\n\n\n\n### Investments[edit]\n\n\nHurley has made several investments. He is a minority owner of the NBA's Golden State Warriors and the MLS' Los Angeles Football Club.[15]\n\n\nOn the January 25, 2021, Hurley announced on Twitter that he had become an investor at Leeds United, the English Premier League football club.[16][17]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nHurley was formerly married to Kathy Clark, the daughter of Silicon Valley entrepreneur James H. Clark.[18] They were divorced in 2012.[19] Hurley remarried in 2020 to Elise Walden.[20]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"YouTube Founders Launch New Video-Sharing App MixBit\". *PC Magazine*.

He is a co-founder of YouTube and the first person to upload a video to the site. The site's inaugural video, \"Me at the zoo\", uploaded on April 23, 2005, has been viewed over 287 million times as of October 1, 2023[update].[2][3] During Karim's time working at PayPal, where he met fellow YouTube co-founders Steven Chen and Chad Hurley, he designed many of its core components, including its real-time anti-fraud system.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nJawed Karim was born on October 28, 1979, in Merseburg, East Germany, to a Bangladeshi father and a German mother.[4] His father Naimul Karim (Bengali: নাইমুল করিম) is a Bangladeshi who is a researcher at 3M, and his mother, Christine, is a German biochemistry scientist at the University of Minnesota.[5] He was the elder of two boys.[6] He crossed the inner German border with his family in the early 1980s because of xenophobia,[7] growing up in Neuss, West Germany.[note 1] Experiencing xenophobia there as well,[7] Karim moved with his family to Saint Paul, Minnesota, in 1992.[8]\n\n\nHe graduated from Saint Paul Central High School in 1997,[9][10] and attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.[9] He left campus prior to graduating to become an early employee at PayPal. He continued his coursework,[8] earning his bachelor's degree in computer science.[11] He subsequently earned a master's degree in computer science from Stanford University.[12] In addition to English, he speaks German and Bengali.[13]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n\"Me at the zoo\", the first video on YouTube, was uploaded by Karim on April 23, 2005.\n![](image)Karim in September 2004\nIn university, Karim served an Internship at Silicon Graphics, Inc., where he worked on 3D voxel data management for very large data sets for volume rendering, including the data for the Visible Human Project.[14] While working at PayPal in 2002, he met Chad Hurley and Steve Chen. Three years later, in 2005, they founded the video-sharing website YouTube.[15] Karim created the first channel on YouTube, \"jawed\", on April 23, 2005 PDT (April 24, 2005 UTC),[16] and uploaded the website's first video, \"Me at the zoo\", the same day.[2][3]\n\n\nAfter co-founding the company and developing the YouTube concept and website with Chad Hurley and Steve Chen, Karim enrolled as a graduate student in computer science at Stanford University while acting as an adviser to YouTube. When the site was introduced in February 2005, Karim agreed not to be an employee and simply be an informal adviser, and that he was focusing on his studies.[8] As a result, he took a much lower share in the company compared to Hurley and Chen.[17]\n\n\nBecause of his smaller role in the company, Karim was mostly unknown to the public as the third founder until YouTube was acquired by Google in 2006. Despite his lower share in the company, the purchase was still large enough that he received 137,443 shares of stock, worth about $64 million based on Google's closing stock price at the time.[18]\n\n\nIn October 2006, Karim gave a lecture about the history of YouTube at the University of Illinois annual ACM Conference entitled *YouTube From Concept to Hyper growth*. Karim returned again to the University of Illinois in May 2008 as the 136th and youngest commencement speaker in the school's history.[19][20]\n\n\n\n## Investments[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2008, Karim launched a venture fund called Youniversity Ventures (now known as YVentures) with partners Keith Rabois and Kevin Hartz.[21] Karim is one of Airbnb's first investors, investing in the company's initial seed round in April 2009.[22] Y Ventures has also invested in Palantir, Reddit and Eventbrite.[23]\n\n\n\n## Responses to YouTube[edit]\n\n\nOccasionally, Karim has updated the video description of \"Me at the zoo\" to criticize decisions made by YouTube.\n\n\nOn November 6, 2013, YouTube began requiring that commenting on its videos be done via a Google+ account, a move that was widely opposed by the YouTube community. An online petition to revert the change garnered over 240,000 signatures.[24]\n\n\nIn response to Google requiring YouTube members to use Google+ for its comment system, Karim wrote on his YouTube account, \"why the fuck do i need a Google+ account to comment on a video?\", and updated the video description on his first video titled \"Me at the zoo\" to \"I can't comment here anymore, since i don't want a Google+ account\".[25]\n\n\nIn response to pressure from the YouTube community, Google publicly apologized for forcing Google+ users to use their real names, which was one of the reasons the Google+ integration was unpopular with YouTube users.[26] Google subsequently dropped its Google+ requirement across all products, beginning with YouTube.[27] Google announced in October 2018 its intention to permanently shut down Google+, as it had failed to achieve broad consumer or developer adoption,[28][29] and because of a vulnerability.[30][31] Google+ was closed for personal accounts on April 2, 2019.[32]\n\n\nIn November 2021, Jawed updated the \"Me at the zoo\" video description to include \"When every YouTuber agrees that removing dislikes is a stupid idea, it probably is. Try again, YouTube🤦‍♂️.\"[33] A few days later, Karim updated the description again to a more detailed condemnation of YouTube's decision.[34]\n\n\nIn early 2023, Jawed updated the description again to include the time-stamped chapters of \"Me at the zoo\". Here is the new description below:\n\n\n\n\n> Chapters:\n> \n> \n> 00:00 Intro\n> \n> \n> 00:05 The cool thing\n> \n> \n> 00:17 End\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* PayPal Mafia\n* History of YouTube\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Sources vary regarding the year that the family moved from East Germany to West Germany. *The New York Times* says 1980.[8] *Star Weekend Magazine* says at the end of summer 1981.[9] *Die Welt* says 1982.[7]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"About jawed\".
