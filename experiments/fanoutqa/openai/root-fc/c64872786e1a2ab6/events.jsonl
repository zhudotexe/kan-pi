Beijing's loss to Sydney was seen as a \"significant blow\" to an \"urgent political priority\" of the Chinese Communist Party leadership having mounted the most intense and expensive candidacy campaign at the date so far (this includes the Summer and Winter Games). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe organisation of the Games included not only the actual sporting events, but also the management (and sometimes construction) of the sporting venues and surrounding precincts, the organisation of the Sydney Olympic Arts Festival, and the Olympic torch relay, which began in Greece and travelled to Australia via numerous Oceania island nations.\n\n\n\n### Phases of the Olympic project[edit]\n\n\nThe staging of the Olympics were treated as a project on a vast scale, broken into several broad phases:\n\n\n\n* 1993 to 1996 – positioning\n* 1997 – going operational\n* 1998 – procurement/venuisation\n* 1999 – testing/refinement\n* 2000 – implementation\n* 2001 – post-implementation and wind-down\n\n\n### SOCOG organisational design[edit]\n\n\nThe internal organisation of SOCOG evolved over the phases of the project and changed, sometimes radically, several times.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Israel\n* Italy\n* Latvia\n* Liechtenstein\n* Lithuania\n* Luxembourg\n* Macedonia\n* Malta\n* Moldova\n* Monaco\n* Netherlands\n* Norway\n* Poland\n* Portugal\n* Romania\n* Russia\n* San Marino\n* Slovakia\n* Slovenia\n* Spain\n* Sweden\n* Switzerland\n* Turkey\n* Ukraine\n* Yugoslavia\n |\n| Oceania | * American Samoa\n* Australia\n* Cook Islands\n* Fiji\n* Guam\n* Federated States of Micronesia\n* Nauru\n* New Zealand\n* Palau\n* Papua New Guinea\n* Samoa\n* Solomon Islands\n* Tonga\n* Vanuatu\n |\n| Other | * Individual Olympic Athletes\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![](image) Events at the 2000 Summer Olympics (Sydney)\n |\n| --- |\n| * Archery\n* Athletics\n* Badminton\n* Baseball\n* Basketball\n* Boxing\n* Canoeing\n* Cycling\n* Diving\n* Equestrian\n* Fencing\n* Field hockey\n* Football\n* Gymnastics\n* Handball\n* Judo\n* Modern pentathlon\n* Rowing\n* Sailing\n* Shooting\n* Softball\n* Swimming\n* Synchronized swimming\n* Table tennis\n* Taekwondo\n* Tennis\n* Triathlon\n* Volleyball\n* Water polo\n* Weightlifting\n* Wrestling\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe *Oxford Olympics Study 2016* estimates the outturn cost of the Sydney 2000 Summer Olympics at US$5 billion in 2015 dollars and cost overrun at 90% in real terms.[10] This includes sports-related costs only, that is, (i) *operational costs* incurred by the organizing committee to stage the Games, e.g., expenditures for technology, transportation, workforce, administration, security, catering, ceremonies, and medical services, and (ii) *direct capital costs* incurred by the host city and country or private investors to build, e.g., the competition venues, the Olympic village, international broadcast center, and media and press center, which are required to host the Games.

Australia will host the Summer Olympics again in 2032 at Brisbane, Queensland making it the first Oceanic country to host the Olympics three times.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe 2000 Games received universal acclaim, with the organization, volunteers, sportsmanship, and Australian public being lauded in the international media. Bill Bryson of *The Times* called the Sydney Games \"one of the most successful events on the world stage\", saying that they \"couldn't be better\".[3] James Mossop of the *Electronic Telegraph* called the Games \"such a success that any city considering bidding for future Olympics must be wondering how it can reach the standards set by Sydney\",[4] while Jack Todd of the *Montreal Gazette* suggested that the \"IOC should quit while it's ahead. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the period leading up to 1999, after Sydney had won the bid, the small group of volunteers grew from approximately 42 to around 500. These volunteers became known as Pioneer Volunteers. The Pioneer Volunteer program was managed internally by SOCOG's Volunteer Services Department in consultation with prominent peak groups like The Centre for Volunteering (Volunteering and TAFE. Some of the Pioneer Volunteers still meet every four months, an unseen legacy of the games which brought together a community spirit not seen before.\n\n\nDuring the Olympic games, tens of thousands of volunteers (the official figure placed at 46,967)[32] helped everywhere at the Olympic venues and elsewhere in the city. They were honoured with a parade like the athletes had a few days before.[33]\n\n\n\n### Venues[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2000 Summer Olympics venues\n\n#### Sydney Olympic Park[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sydney Olympic Park\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe design process of the official logo, as well as all other aspects of the Olympic Games' visual design identity, was awarded to Melbourne design studio FHA Image Design.[37] The Sydney Olympics brand identity project officially started in 1993, and lasted 7 years. It was also up to FHA Design to prepare the visual identity of the Paralympic Games and this also absorbed some elements as the identification signals and the pictograms.\n\n\n\n### Mascots[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Olly, Syd and Millie\n\nThe official mascots chosen for the 2000 Summer Olympics were Syd the platypus, Millie the echidna, and Olly the kookaburra,[38] designed by Matthew Hattan and Jozef Szekeres and named by Philip Sheldon of agency Weekes Morris Osborn in response to the original SOCOG recommendation of Murray, Margery, and Dawn after famous Australian athletes.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIt has been estimated that the economic impact of the 2000 Olympics was that A$2.1 billion has been shaved from public consumption. Economic growth was not stimulated to a net benefit and in the years after 2000, foreign tourism to NSW grew by less than tourism to Australia as a whole. A \"multiplier\" effect on broader economic development was not realized, as a simple \"multiplier\" analysis fails to capture that resources have to be redirected from elsewhere: the building of a stadium is at the expense of other public works such as extensions to hospitals. Building sporting venues does not add to the aggregate stock of productive capital in the years following the Games: \"Equestrian centers, softball compounds, and man-made rapids are not particularly useful beyond their immediate function.\"[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMany venues that were constructed in Sydney Olympic Park failed financially in the years immediately following the Olympics to meet the expected bookings to meet upkeep expenses. It was only the 2003 Rugby World Cup that reconnected the park back to citizens.[15] In recent years, infrastructure costs for some facilities have been of growing concern to the NSW Government, especially facilities in Western Sydney.[15] Proposed metro and light rail links from Olympic Park to Parramatta have been estimated to cost in the same order of magnitude as the public expenditure on the games.[16][*citation needed*] Stadium Australia had been considered for demolition in 2017 by then NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian, citing that the stadium was \"built for an Olympics\" but not for modern spectators.[17] The plan was scrapped in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic.[18] The Dunc Gray Velodrome has also struggled to keep up its $500,000 per year maintenance costs,[16] although it is still used for track cycling events.[19]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ![](image) Togo (3)\n* ![](image) Tonga (3)\n* ![](image) Trinidad and Tobago (19)\n* ![](image) Tunisia (47)\n* ![](image) Turkey (57)\n* ![](image) Turkmenistan (8)\n* ![](image) Uganda (13)\n* ![](image) Ukraine (230)\n* ![](image) United Arab Emirates (4)\n* ![](image) United States (586)\n* ![](image) Uruguay (15)\n* ![](image) Uzbekistan (70)\n* ![](image) Vanuatu (3)\n* ![](image) Venezuela (50)\n* ![](image) Vietnam (7)\n* ![](image) Virgin Islands (9)\n* ![](image) Yemen (2)\n* ![](image) FR Yugoslavia (109)\n* ![](image) Zambia (8)\n* ![](image) Zimbabwe (16)\n |\n\n\n## Medal count[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2000 Summer Olympics medal table\n\nThese are the top ten nations that won medals in the 2000 Games.\n\n\nThe ranking in this table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee.[30] Some other sources[31] may be inconsistent due to not taking into account all later doping cases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ![](image) Triathlon (2)\n* ![](image) Volleyball\n\t+ Volleyball (2)\n\t+ Beach volleyball (2)\n* ![](image) Weightlifting (15)\n* ![](image) Wrestling\n\t+ Freestyle (8)\n\t+ Greco-Roman (8)\n\n\n |\n |\n\n\nAlthough demonstration sports were abolished following the 1992 Summer Olympics, the Sydney Olympics featured wheelchair racing as exhibition events on the athletics schedule.[28]\n\n\nSpecial quarantine conditions were introduced to allow entry of horses into Australia to participate in equestrian events,[29] avoiding the need for such events to take place elsewhere as had happened at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne.\n\n\n\n### Calendar[edit]\n\n\n*All dates are in AEDST (UTC+11); the other two cities, Adelaide uses ACST (UTC+9:30) and Brisbane uses AEST (UTC+10)*\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **OC** | Opening ceremony\n | ● | Event competitions\n | **1** | Gold medal events\n | **CC** | Closing ceremony\n |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)SOCOG organisational structure circa 1998 – five groups and 33 divisions reporting to the CEO are organised primarily along functional lines with only a limited number of divisions (e.g. Interstate Football and Villages) anticipating a venue focussed design.\n![](image)SOCOG organisational structure circa 1999 – functional divisions and precinct/venue streams are organised in a matrix structure linked to the Main Operations Centre (MOC).

However, much of the planning and operation of the Paralympic Games was outsourced to SOCOG such that most operational programmes planned both the Olympic and Paralympic Games.\n\n\n\n### Other Olympic events[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn late 1998, the design was principally functional. The top two tiers below the CEO Sandy Hollway consisted of five groups (managed by Group General Managers and the Deputy CEO) and twenty divisions (managed by divisional General Managers), which in turn were further broken up into programmes and sub-programmes or projects.\n\n\nIn 1999, functional areas (FAs) broke up into geographic precinct and venue teams (managed by Precinct Managers and Venue Managers) with functional area staff reporting to both the FA manager and the venue manager. SOCOG moved to a matrix structure. The Interstate Football division extant in 1998 was the first of these geographically based venue teams.\n\n\n\n### Volunteer program[edit]\n\n\nThe origins of the volunteer program for Sydney 2000 dates back to the bid, as early as 1992.\n\n\nOn 17 December 1992, a group of Sydney citizens interested in the prospect of hosting the 2000 Olympic and Paralympic Games gathered for a meeting at Sports House at Wentworth Park in Sydney.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) and the Sydney Paralympic Organizing Committee (SPOC), primarily responsibles for the staging of the Games\n* Olympic Coordination Authority (OCA), primarily responsible for construction and oversight\n* Olympic Roads & Transport Authority (ORTA)\n* Olympic Security Command Centre (OSCC)\n* Olympic Intelligence Centre (OIC)\n* JTF Gold the Australian Defence Force Joint Taskforce Gold\n* Sydney Olympic Broadcasting Organisation (nominally part of SOCOG)\n* IBM, provider of technology and the Technical Command Centre\n* Telstra, provider of telecommunications\n* Great Big Events, event management and marketing\n\n\nThese organisations worked closely together and with other bodies such as:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Olympic colours on the Sydney Harbour Bridge.\nThe last event of the games was the Men's Marathon, contested on a course that started in North Sydney. The event was won by Ethiopian Gezahegne Abera, with Kenyan Erick Wainaina second, and Tesfaye Tola, also of Ethiopia, third. It was the first time since the 1968 Olympics that an Ethiopian won the gold medal in this event.\n\n\nThe closing ceremony commenced with Christine Anu performing her version of the Warumpi Band's song \"My Island Home\", with several Aboriginal dancers atop the Geodome Stage in the middle of the stadium, around which several hundred umbrella and lamp box kids created an image of Aboriginal Dreamtime. The Geodome Stage was used throughout the ceremony, which was a flat stage mechanically raised into the shape of a Geode.\n\n\nIOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch declared at the Closing Ceremony,[27]\n\n\n\n\n> \"I am proud and happy to proclaim that you have presented to the world the best Olympic Games ever.\"\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ medalists\n* Scandals and controversies\n\t+ antisemitism\n\t+ colonialism\n\t+ doping\n* Deaths\n\t+ WWI\n\t+ WWII\n* Participation of women\n |\n| Related | * Paralympic Games\n* Continental\n\t+ African\n\t+ Asian\n\t+ European\n\t+ Pacific\n\t+ Pan-American\n* Olympic Esports Series\n* Deaflympics\n* Special Olympics\n* 1906 Intercalated Games\n* Ancient Olympic Games\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n38. **^** \"Syd, Olly and Millie – mascots of the 2000 Olympic Summer Games\".

It was produced and filmed by the Sydney Olympic Broadcasting Organisation and the home nation broadcaster Channel 7.[20] This was introduced by lone rider Steve Jefferys and his rearing Australian Stock Horse *Ammo*. At the cracking of Jefferys' stockwhip, a further 120 riders entered the stadium, their stock horses performing intricate steps, including forming the five Olympic Rings, to a Special Olympics version of the theme, which Bruce Rowland had previously composed for the 1982 film *The Man from Snowy River*.\n\n\nThe Australian National Anthem was sung in the first verse by Human Nature and the second by Julie Anthony.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Canberra Stadium, Canberra: Football\n* Hindmarsh Stadium, Adelaide: Football\n* Melbourne Cricket Ground: Football\n* The Gabba (Brisbane Cricket Ground), Brisbane: Football\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\n### Official logo[edit]\n\n\nThe bid logo was introduced in 1992 and created by architect and designer Michael Bryce.[34] It featured a colourful, stylised image of the Sydney Opera House which is a possible reference to the motif of the rainbow serpent. \n\n\nThe official logo was revealed in 1996, and is also referred to as the \"Millennium Man\".[35] It incorporated similar curves to the bid logo and combined them with a stylised image of a runner to form a torchbearer in motion. The image of the runners composed of two small yellow boomerangs for arms and a larger red boomerang for legs.

Four athletes from East Timor also marched in the parade of nations as individual Olympic athletes and marched directly before the host country.

The Canadian flag was flown at half-mast for the remainder of the Olympics, on orders from both IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch and Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy, as the state funeral did not take place until 3 October, two days after the closing ceremony, and the Canadian athletes subsequently rushed back to attend his funeral after 1 October. \n\n\n\n#### Day 16: 30 September[edit]\n\n\nCameroon won a historic gold medal over Spain in the Men's Olympic Football Final at the Olympic Stadium. The game went to a penalty shootout, which was won by Cameroon 5–3.[26]\n\n\n\n#### Day 17: 1 October[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2000 Summer Olympics closing ceremony\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Triathlon made its Olympic debut with the women's race. Set in the surroundings of the Sydney Opera House, Brigitte McMahon representing Switzerland swam, cycled and ran to the first gold medal in the sport, beating the favoured home athletes such as Michelie Jones who won silver. McMahon only passed Jones in sight of the finish line.\n\n\nThe first star of the Games was 17-year-old Australian Ian Thorpe, who first set a new world record in the 400-metre freestyle final before competing in an exciting 4 × 100 m freestyle final. Swimming the last leg, Thorpe passed the leading American team and arrived in a new world record time, two-tenths of a second ahead of the Americans. In the same event for women, the Americans also broke the world record, finishing ahead of the Netherlands and Sweden.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThis meant that the Olympic flame was suspended in mid-air for about four minutes rather than immediately rising up a water-covered ramp to the top of the stadium. When the cause of the problem was discovered, the program was overridden and the cauldron continued its course, and the ceremony concluded with a fireworks display.[25]\n\n\n\n#### Day 2: 16 September[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gold medallist Nancy Johnson (centre) of the U.S., raises her hands with silver medallist Kang Cho-hyun (left), of South Korea, and bronze winner Gao Jing (right), of China, during the first medal ceremony of the 2000 Olympic Games.\nThe first medals of the Games were awarded in the women's 10 metre air rifle competition, which was won by Nancy Johnson of the United States.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Hamiltons Laboratories\n* Harley-Davidson\n* Lifeminders.com\n* Lindeman's\n* Linfox\n* Looksmart\n* Mistral\n* New South Wales Department of Information Technology & Management\n* Pacific Waste Management\n* Ramler Furniture\n* Rogen\n* Salomon Smith Barney\n* Saunders Design\n* Showpower\n* Sonic Healthcare\n* Speedo\n* Val Morgan\n* Visy\n* Waste Services NSW\n* Woolcott Research\n* Woolmark\n |\n\n\n## Medals and bouquets[edit]\n\n\nA total of 750 gold, 750 silver and 780 bronze medals were minted for the Games. The gold and silver medals contained 99.99 percent of pure silver. The bronze medals were 99 percent bronze with one percent silver, they were made by melting down Australian one-cent and two-cent coins,[42][43][44] which had been removed from circulation from 1992 onward.\n\n\nThe bouquets handed to medal recipients incorporated foliage from the Grevillea baileyana, also known as the white oak.[45]\n\n\n\n## Awards and commendations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSamaranch had to leave for home, as his wife was severely ill. Upon arrival, his wife had already died. Samaranch returned to Sydney four days later. The Olympic flag was flown at half-staff during the period as a sign of respect to Samaranch's wife.\n\n\n\n#### Day 3: 17 September[edit]\n\n\nCanadian Simon Whitfield sprinted away in the last 100 metres of the men's triathlon, becoming the inaugural winner in the event.\n\n\nOn the cycling track, Robert Bartko beat fellow German Jens Lehmann in the individual pursuit, setting a new Olympic Record. Leontien Zijlaard-van Moorsel set a world record in the semi-finals the same event for women.\n\n\nIn the swimming pool, American Tom Dolan beat the world record in the 400-metre medley, successfully defending the title he won in Atlanta four years prior. Dutchwoman Inge de Bruijn also clocked a new world record, beating her own time in the 100 m butterfly final to win by more than a second.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n#### Day 4: 18 September[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPortals:* ![](image) 2000s\n* ![](image) Olympics\n* ![flag](image) Australia\n\n| Authority control databases ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n |\n| --- |\n| International | * VIAF\n |\n| National | * Germany\n* Israel\n* United States\n* Czech Republic\n |\n| Geographic | * Structurae\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n43. **^** Vyver, James (19 July 2012). \"Treasure Trove: medals from the Sydney Olympics\". *ABC Online*.

Then, celebrating 100 years of women's participation in the Olympic Games, former Australian women Olympic medalists Betty Cuthbert and Raelene Boyle, Dawn Fraser, Shirley Strickland (later Shirley Strickland de la Hunty), Shane Gould and Debbie Flintoff-King brought the torch through the stadium, handing it over to Cathy Freeman, who lit the flame in the cauldron within a circle of fire. The choice of Freeman, an Aboriginal woman, to light the flame was notable given the history of human rights abuses against Aboriginal people in Australia.[23] Following her lighting, Freeman was the subject of racial abuse from some Australians.[24] The planned spectacular climax to the ceremony was delayed by the technical glitch of a computer switch which malfunctioned, causing the sequence to shut down by giving a false reading. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![](image) Athletics |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | **2** | **3** | **5** | **9** |  | **7** | **6** | **5** | **8** | **1** | **46** |\n| ![](image) Badminton |  |  |  | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | **2** | **1** | **2** |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | **5** |\n| Baseball/Softball\n |\n| ![](image) Baseball |  |  |  |  | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n |  | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n |  | ●\n | **1** |  |  |  |  | **2** |\n| ![](image) Softball |  |  |  |  | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n |  | ●\n | **1** |  |  |  |  |  |\n| ![](image) Basketball |  |  |  | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | **1** | **1** | **2** |\n| ![](image) Boxing |  |  |  | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n |  | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | **6** | **6** | **12** |\n| Canoeing | ![](image) Slalom\n |  |  |  |  | ●\n | **2** | ●\n | **2** |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | **16** |\n| ![](image) Sprint\n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | **6** | **6** |\n| Cycling | ![](image) Road cycling\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe main event for the Australians on the fourth day of the Games was the 200 m freestyle. Dutchman Pieter van den Hoogenband had broken the world record in the semi-finals, taking it from the new Australian hero Ian Thorpe, who came close to the world record in his semi-final heat. As the final race finished, Van den Hoogenband's time was exactly the same as in the semi-finals, finishing ahead of Thorpe by half a second.\n\n\nChina won the gold medal in the men's team all-around gymnastics competition after being the runner-up in the previous two Olympics. The other medals were taken by Ukraine and Russia, respectively.\n\n\nZijlaard-van Moorsel lived up to the expectations set by her world record in cycling in the semis by winning the gold medal.\n\n\n\n#### Day 7: 21 September[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Participating National Olympic Committees |\n| --- |\n| * ![](image) Albania (4 athletes)\n* ![](image) Algeria (47)\n* ![](image) American Samoa (4)\n* ![](image) Andorra (5)\n* ![](image) Angola (30)\n* ![](image) Antigua and Barbuda (3)\n* ![](image) Argentina (143)\n* ![](image) Armenia (25)\n* ![](image) Aruba (5)\n* ![](image) Australia (617) **(host)**\n* ![](image) Austria (92)\n* ![](image) Azerbaijan (31)\n* ![](image) Bahamas (25)\n* ![](image) Bahrain (4)\n* ![](image) Bangladesh (5)\n* ![](image) Barbados (18)\n* ![](image) Belarus (139)\n* ![](image) Belgium (68)\n* ![](image) Belize (2)\n* ![](image) Benin (4)\n* ![](image) Bermuda (6)\n* ![](image) Bhutan (2)\n* ![](image) Bolivia (5)\n* ![](image) Bosnia and Herzegovina (9)\n* ![](image) Botswana (7)\n* ![](image) Brazil (198)\n* ![](image) British Virgin Islands (1)\n* ![](image) Brunei (2)\n* ![](image) Bulgaria (91)\n* ![](image) Burkina Faso (4)\n* ![](image) Burundi (6)\n* ![](image) Cambodia (4)\n* ![](image) Cameroon (34)\n* ![](image) Canada (294)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | **1** | **1** |  |  | **2** |  | **18** |\n| ![](image) Track cycling\n |  |  |  | **2** | **2** | **1** | **1** | **3** | **3** |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| ![](image) Mountain biking |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | **1** | **1** |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| ![](image) Equestrian |  |  |  | ●\n |  | ●\n | **1** | ●\n | ●\n | **1** |  |  | ●\n | **1** |  | **1** | ●\n | **1** | **1** | **6** |\n| ![](image) Fencing |  |  |  | **1** | **1** | **1** | **1** | **1** | **2** | **1** | **1** | **1** |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | **10** |\n| ![](image) Field hockey |  |  |  | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | **1** | **1** |  | **2** |\n| ![](image) Football | ●\n | ●\n |  | ●\n | ●\n |  | ●\n | ●\n |  | ●\n | ●\n |  | ●\n | ●\n |  | **1** | ●\n | **1** |  | **2** |\n| Gymnastics | ![](image) Artistic\n |  |  |  | ●\n | ●\n | **1** | **1** | **1** | **1** |  |  | **5** | **5** |  |  |  |  |  |  | **18** |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nRomanian gymnast Andreea Răducan ultimately took gold while her teammates, Simona Amânar and Maria Olaru took silver and bronze, respectively.\n\n\n\n#### Day 9: 23 September[edit]\n\n\nBy rowing in the winning coxless four, Steve Redgrave of Great Britain became a member of a select group who had won gold medals at five consecutive Olympics.\n\n\nThe swimming 4 x 100-metre medley relay of B.J.

Cameroon, Colombia, Latvia, Mozambique, and Slovenia won a gold medal for the first time in their Olympic histories, while Barbados, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, North Macedonia, Saudi Arabia, and Vietnam won their first-ever Olympic medals. Australia will host the Summer Olympics again in 2032 at Brisbane, Queensland making it the first Oceanic country to host the Olympics three times.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe 2000 Games received universal acclaim, with the organization, volunteers, sportsmanship, and Australian public being lauded in the international media. Bill Bryson of *The Times* called the Sydney Games \"one of the most successful events on the world stage\", saying that they \"couldn't be better\".[3] James Mossop of the *Electronic Telegraph* called the Games \"such a success that any city considering bidding for future Olympics must be wondering how it can reach the standards set by Sydney\",[4] while Jack Todd of the *Montreal Gazette* suggested that the \"IOC should quit while it's ahead. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the period leading up to 1999, after Sydney had won the bid, the small group of volunteers grew from approximately 42 to around 500. These volunteers became known as Pioneer Volunteers. The Pioneer Volunteer program was managed internally by SOCOG's Volunteer Services Department in consultation with prominent peak groups like The Centre for Volunteering (Volunteering and TAFE. Some of the Pioneer Volunteers still meet every four months, an unseen legacy of the games which brought together a community spirit not seen before.\n\n\nDuring the Olympic games, tens of thousands of volunteers (the official figure placed at 46,967)[32] helped everywhere at the Olympic venues and elsewhere in the city. They were honoured with a parade like the athletes had a few days before.[33]\n\n\n\n### Venues[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2000 Summer Olympics venues\n\n#### Sydney Olympic Park[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sydney Olympic Park\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe design process of the official logo, as well as all other aspects of the Olympic Games' visual design identity, was awarded to Melbourne design studio FHA Image Design.[37] The Sydney Olympics brand identity project officially started in 1993, and lasted 7 years. It was also up to FHA Design to prepare the visual identity of the Paralympic Games and this also absorbed some elements as the identification signals and the pictograms.\n\n\n\n### Mascots[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Olly, Syd and Millie\n\nThe official mascots chosen for the 2000 Summer Olympics were Syd the platypus, Millie the echidna, and Olly the kookaburra,[38] designed by Matthew Hattan and Jozef Szekeres and named by Philip Sheldon of agency Weekes Morris Osborn in response to the original SOCOG recommendation of Murray, Margery, and Dawn after famous Australian athletes.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIt has been estimated that the economic impact of the 2000 Olympics was that A$2.1 billion has been shaved from public consumption. Economic growth was not stimulated to a net benefit and in the years after 2000, foreign tourism to NSW grew by less than tourism to Australia as a whole. A \"multiplier\" effect on broader economic development was not realized, as a simple \"multiplier\" analysis fails to capture that resources have to be redirected from elsewhere: the building of a stadium is at the expense of other public works such as extensions to hospitals. Building sporting venues does not add to the aggregate stock of productive capital in the years following the Games: \"Equestrian centers, softball compounds, and man-made rapids are not particularly useful beyond their immediate function.\"[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMany venues that were constructed in Sydney Olympic Park failed financially in the years immediately following the Olympics to meet the expected bookings to meet upkeep expenses. It was only the 2003 Rugby World Cup that reconnected the park back to citizens.[15] In recent years, infrastructure costs for some facilities have been of growing concern to the NSW Government, especially facilities in Western Sydney.[15] Proposed metro and light rail links from Olympic Park to Parramatta have been estimated to cost in the same order of magnitude as the public expenditure on the games.[16][*citation needed*] Stadium Australia had been considered for demolition in 2017 by then NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian, citing that the stadium was \"built for an Olympics\" but not for modern spectators.[17] The plan was scrapped in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic.[18] The Dunc Gray Velodrome has also struggled to keep up its $500,000 per year maintenance costs,[16] although it is still used for track cycling events.[19]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ![](image) Togo (3)\n* ![](image) Tonga (3)\n* ![](image) Trinidad and Tobago (19)\n* ![](image) Tunisia (47)\n* ![](image) Turkey (57)\n* ![](image) Turkmenistan (8)\n* ![](image) Uganda (13)\n* ![](image) Ukraine (230)\n* ![](image) United Arab Emirates (4)\n* ![](image) United States (586)\n* ![](image) Uruguay (15)\n* ![](image) Uzbekistan (70)\n* ![](image) Vanuatu (3)\n* ![](image) Venezuela (50)\n* ![](image) Vietnam (7)\n* ![](image) Virgin Islands (9)\n* ![](image) Yemen (2)\n* ![](image) FR Yugoslavia (109)\n* ![](image) Zambia (8)\n* ![](image) Zimbabwe (16)\n |\n\n\n## Medal count[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2000 Summer Olympics medal table\n\nThese are the top ten nations that won medals in the 2000 Games.\n\n\nThe ranking in this table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee.[30] Some other sources[31] may be inconsistent due to not taking into account all later doping cases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ![](image) Triathlon (2)\n* ![](image) Volleyball\n\t+ Volleyball (2)\n\t+ Beach volleyball (2)\n* ![](image) Weightlifting (15)\n* ![](image) Wrestling\n\t+ Freestyle (8)\n\t+ Greco-Roman (8)\n\n\n |\n |\n\n\nAlthough demonstration sports were abolished following the 1992 Summer Olympics, the Sydney Olympics featured wheelchair racing as exhibition events on the athletics schedule.[28]\n\n\nSpecial quarantine conditions were introduced to allow entry of horses into Australia to participate in equestrian events,[29] avoiding the need for such events to take place elsewhere as had happened at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne.\n\n\n\n### Calendar[edit]\n\n\n*All dates are in AEDST (UTC+11); the other two cities, Adelaide uses ACST (UTC+9:30) and Brisbane uses AEST (UTC+10)*\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **OC** | Opening ceremony\n | ● | Event competitions\n | **1** | Gold medal events\n | **CC** | Closing ceremony\n |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)SOCOG organisational structure circa 1998 – five groups and 33 divisions reporting to the CEO are organised primarily along functional lines with only a limited number of divisions (e.g. Interstate Football and Villages) anticipating a venue focussed design.\n![](image)SOCOG organisational structure circa 1999 – functional divisions and precinct/venue streams are organised in a matrix structure linked to the Main Operations Centre (MOC). Some functions such as Project Management (in the Games Coordination group) continue to exist largely outside this matrix structure.\n### Organisations responsible for the Olympics[edit]\n\n\nA number of quasi-government bodies were responsible for the construction, organisation and execution of the Sydney Games.

However, much of the planning and operation of the Paralympic Games was outsourced to SOCOG such that most operational programmes planned both the Olympic and Paralympic Games.\n\n\n\n### Other Olympic events[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn late 1998, the design was principally functional. The top two tiers below the CEO Sandy Hollway consisted of five groups (managed by Group General Managers and the Deputy CEO) and twenty divisions (managed by divisional General Managers), which in turn were further broken up into programmes and sub-programmes or projects.\n\n\nIn 1999, functional areas (FAs) broke up into geographic precinct and venue teams (managed by Precinct Managers and Venue Managers) with functional area staff reporting to both the FA manager and the venue manager. SOCOG moved to a matrix structure. The Interstate Football division extant in 1998 was the first of these geographically based venue teams.\n\n\n\n### Volunteer program[edit]\n\n\nThe origins of the volunteer program for Sydney 2000 dates back to the bid, as early as 1992.\n\n\nOn 17 December 1992, a group of Sydney citizens interested in the prospect of hosting the 2000 Olympic and Paralympic Games gathered for a meeting at Sports House at Wentworth Park in Sydney.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) and the Sydney Paralympic Organizing Committee (SPOC), primarily responsibles for the staging of the Games\n* Olympic Coordination Authority (OCA), primarily responsible for construction and oversight\n* Olympic Roads & Transport Authority (ORTA)\n* Olympic Security Command Centre (OSCC)\n* Olympic Intelligence Centre (OIC)\n* JTF Gold the Australian Defence Force Joint Taskforce Gold\n* Sydney Olympic Broadcasting Organisation (nominally part of SOCOG)\n* IBM, provider of technology and the Technical Command Centre\n* Telstra, provider of telecommunications\n* Great Big Events, event management and marketing\n\n\nThese organisations worked closely together and with other bodies such as:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Olympic colours on the Sydney Harbour Bridge.\nThe last event of the games was the Men's Marathon, contested on a course that started in North Sydney. The event was won by Ethiopian Gezahegne Abera, with Kenyan Erick Wainaina second, and Tesfaye Tola, also of Ethiopia, third. It was the first time since the 1968 Olympics that an Ethiopian won the gold medal in this event.\n\n\nThe closing ceremony commenced with Christine Anu performing her version of the Warumpi Band's song \"My Island Home\", with several Aboriginal dancers atop the Geodome Stage in the middle of the stadium, around which several hundred umbrella and lamp box kids created an image of Aboriginal Dreamtime. The Geodome Stage was used throughout the ceremony, which was a flat stage mechanically raised into the shape of a Geode.\n\n\nIOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch declared at the Closing Ceremony,[27]\n\n\n\n\n> \"I am proud and happy to proclaim that you have presented to the world the best Olympic Games ever.\"\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ medalists\n* Scandals and controversies\n\t+ antisemitism\n\t+ colonialism\n\t+ doping\n* Deaths\n\t+ WWI\n\t+ WWII\n* Participation of women\n |\n| Related | * Paralympic Games\n* Continental\n\t+ African\n\t+ Asian\n\t+ European\n\t+ Pacific\n\t+ Pan-American\n* Olympic Esports Series\n* Deaflympics\n* Special Olympics\n* 1906 Intercalated Games\n* Ancient Olympic Games\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n38. **^** \"Syd, Olly and Millie – mascots of the 2000 Olympic Summer Games\".

It was produced and filmed by the Sydney Olympic Broadcasting Organisation and the home nation broadcaster Channel 7.[20] This was introduced by lone rider Steve Jefferys and his rearing Australian Stock Horse *Ammo*. At the cracking of Jefferys' stockwhip, a further 120 riders entered the stadium, their stock horses performing intricate steps, including forming the five Olympic Rings, to a Special Olympics version of the theme, which Bruce Rowland had previously composed for the 1982 film *The Man from Snowy River*.\n\n\nThe Australian National Anthem was sung in the first verse by Human Nature and the second by Julie Anthony.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Canberra Stadium, Canberra: Football\n* Hindmarsh Stadium, Adelaide: Football\n* Melbourne Cricket Ground: Football\n* The Gabba (Brisbane Cricket Ground), Brisbane: Football\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\n### Official logo[edit]\n\n\nThe bid logo was introduced in 1992 and created by architect and designer Michael Bryce.[34] It featured a colourful, stylised image of the Sydney Opera House which is a possible reference to the motif of the rainbow serpent. \n\n\nThe official logo was revealed in 1996, and is also referred to as the \"Millennium Man\".[35] It incorporated similar curves to the bid logo and combined them with a stylised image of a runner to form a torchbearer in motion.

Four athletes from East Timor also marched in the parade of nations as individual Olympic athletes and marched directly before the host country. Although the country-to-be had no National Olympic Committee then, they were allowed to compete under the Olympic Flag with country code IOA.

The Canadian flag was flown at half-mast for the remainder of the Olympics, on orders from both IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch and Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy, as the state funeral did not take place until 3 October, two days after the closing ceremony, and the Canadian athletes subsequently rushed back to attend his funeral after 1 October. \n\n\n\n#### Day 16: 30 September[edit]\n\n\nCameroon won a historic gold medal over Spain in the Men's Olympic Football Final at the Olympic Stadium. The game went to a penalty shootout, which was won by Cameroon 5–3.[26]\n\n\n\n#### Day 17: 1 October[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2000 Summer Olympics closing ceremony\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Triathlon made its Olympic debut with the women's race. Set in the surroundings of the Sydney Opera House, Brigitte McMahon representing Switzerland swam, cycled and ran to the first gold medal in the sport, beating the favoured home athletes such as Michelie Jones who won silver. McMahon only passed Jones in sight of the finish line.\n\n\nThe first star of the Games was 17-year-old Australian Ian Thorpe, who first set a new world record in the 400-metre freestyle final before competing in an exciting 4 × 100 m freestyle final. Swimming the last leg, Thorpe passed the leading American team and arrived in a new world record time, two-tenths of a second ahead of the Americans. In the same event for women, the Americans also broke the world record, finishing ahead of the Netherlands and Sweden.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThis meant that the Olympic flame was suspended in mid-air for about four minutes rather than immediately rising up a water-covered ramp to the top of the stadium. When the cause of the problem was discovered, the program was overridden and the cauldron continued its course, and the ceremony concluded with a fireworks display.[25]\n\n\n\n#### Day 2: 16 September[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gold medallist Nancy Johnson (centre) of the U.S., raises her hands with silver medallist Kang Cho-hyun (left), of South Korea, and bronze winner Gao Jing (right), of China, during the first medal ceremony of the 2000 Olympic Games.\nThe first medals of the Games were awarded in the women's 10 metre air rifle competition, which was won by Nancy Johnson of the United States.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Hamiltons Laboratories\n* Harley-Davidson\n* Lifeminders.com\n* Lindeman's\n* Linfox\n* Looksmart\n* Mistral\n* New South Wales Department of Information Technology & Management\n* Pacific Waste Management\n* Ramler Furniture\n* Rogen\n* Salomon Smith Barney\n* Saunders Design\n* Showpower\n* Sonic Healthcare\n* Speedo\n* Val Morgan\n* Visy\n* Waste Services NSW\n* Woolcott Research\n* Woolmark\n |\n\n\n## Medals and bouquets[edit]\n\n\nA total of 750 gold, 750 silver and 780 bronze medals were minted for the Games. The gold and silver medals contained 99.99 percent of pure silver. The bronze medals were 99 percent bronze with one percent silver, they were made by melting down Australian one-cent and two-cent coins,[42][43][44] which had been removed from circulation from 1992 onward.\n\n\nThe bouquets handed to medal recipients incorporated foliage from the Grevillea baileyana, also known as the white oak.[45]\n\n\n\n## Awards and commendations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSamaranch had to leave for home, as his wife was severely ill. Upon arrival, his wife had already died. Samaranch returned to Sydney four days later. The Olympic flag was flown at half-staff during the period as a sign of respect to Samaranch's wife.\n\n\n\n#### Day 3: 17 September[edit]\n\n\nCanadian Simon Whitfield sprinted away in the last 100 metres of the men's triathlon, becoming the inaugural winner in the event.\n\n\nOn the cycling track, Robert Bartko beat fellow German Jens Lehmann in the individual pursuit, setting a new Olympic Record. Leontien Zijlaard-van Moorsel set a world record in the semi-finals the same event for women.\n\n\nIn the swimming pool, American Tom Dolan beat the world record in the 400-metre medley, successfully defending the title he won in Atlanta four years prior. Dutchwoman Inge de Bruijn also clocked a new world record, beating her own time in the 100 m butterfly final to win by more than a second.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n#### Day 4: 18 September[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPortals:* ![](image) 2000s\n* ![](image) Olympics\n* ![flag](image) Australia\n\n| Authority control databases ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n |\n| --- |\n| International | * VIAF\n |\n| National | * Germany\n* Israel\n* United States\n* Czech Republic\n |\n| Geographic | * Structurae\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n43. **^** Vyver, James (19 July 2012). \"Treasure Trove: medals from the Sydney Olympics\". *ABC Online*.

During the raising of the Olympics Flag, the Olympic Hymn was sung by the Millennium Choir of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia in Greek.

Then, celebrating 100 years of women's participation in the Olympic Games, former Australian women Olympic medalists Betty Cuthbert and Raelene Boyle, Dawn Fraser, Shirley Strickland (later Shirley Strickland de la Hunty), Shane Gould and Debbie Flintoff-King brought the torch through the stadium, handing it over to Cathy Freeman, who lit the flame in the cauldron within a circle of fire. The choice of Freeman, an Aboriginal woman, to light the flame was notable given the history of human rights abuses against Aboriginal people in Australia.[23] Following her lighting, Freeman was the subject of racial abuse from some Australians.[24] The planned spectacular climax to the ceremony was delayed by the technical glitch of a computer switch which malfunctioned, causing the sequence to shut down by giving a false reading. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![](image) Athletics |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | **2** | **3** | **5** | **9** |  | **7** | **6** | **5** | **8** | **1** | **46** |\n| ![](image) Badminton |  |  |  | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | **2** | **1** | **2** |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | **5** |\n| Baseball/Softball\n |\n| ![](image) Baseball |  |  |  |  | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n |  | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n |  | ●\n | **1** |  |  |  |  | **2** |\n| ![](image) Softball |  |  |  |  | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n |  | ●\n | **1** |  |  |  |  |  |\n| ![](image) Basketball |  |  |  | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | **1** | **1** | **2** |\n| ![](image) Boxing |  |  |  | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n |  | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | **6** | **6** | **12** |\n| Canoeing | ![](image) Slalom\n |  |  |  |  | ●\n | **2** | ●\n | **2** |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | **16** |\n| ![](image) Sprint\n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | **6** | **6** |\n| Cycling | ![](image) Road cycling\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe main event for the Australians on the fourth day of the Games was the 200 m freestyle. Dutchman Pieter van den Hoogenband had broken the world record in the semi-finals, taking it from the new Australian hero Ian Thorpe, who came close to the world record in his semi-final heat. As the final race finished, Van den Hoogenband's time was exactly the same as in the semi-finals, finishing ahead of Thorpe by half a second.\n\n\nChina won the gold medal in the men's team all-around gymnastics competition after being the runner-up in the previous two Olympics. The other medals were taken by Ukraine and Russia, respectively.\n\n\nZijlaard-van Moorsel lived up to the expectations set by her world record in cycling in the semis by winning the gold medal.\n\n\n\n#### Day 7: 21 September[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Participating National Olympic Committees |\n| --- |\n| * ![](image) Albania (4 athletes)\n* ![](image) Algeria (47)\n* ![](image) American Samoa (4)\n* ![](image) Andorra (5)\n* ![](image) Angola (30)\n* ![](image) Antigua and Barbuda (3)\n* ![](image) Argentina (143)\n* ![](image) Armenia (25)\n* ![](image) Aruba (5)\n* ![](image) Australia (617) **(host)**\n* ![](image) Austria (92)\n* ![](image) Azerbaijan (31)\n* ![](image) Bahamas (25)\n* ![](image) Bahrain (4)\n* ![](image) Bangladesh (5)\n* ![](image) Barbados (18)\n* ![](image) Belarus (139)\n* ![](image) Belgium (68)\n* ![](image) Belize (2)\n* ![](image) Benin (4)\n* ![](image) Bermuda (6)\n* ![](image) Bhutan (2)\n* ![](image) Bolivia (5)\n* ![](image) Bosnia and Herzegovina (9)\n* ![](image) Botswana (7)\n* ![](image) Brazil (198)\n* ![](image) British Virgin Islands (1)\n* ![](image) Brunei (2)\n* ![](image) Bulgaria (91)\n* ![](image) Burkina Faso (4)\n* ![](image) Burundi (6)\n* ![](image) Cambodia (4)\n* ![](image) Cameroon (34)\n* ![](image) Canada (294)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | **1** | **1** |  |  | **2** |  | **18** |\n| ![](image) Track cycling\n |  |  |  | **2** | **2** | **1** | **1** | **3** | **3** |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| ![](image) Mountain biking |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | **1** | **1** |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| ![](image) Equestrian |  |  |  | ●\n |  | ●\n | **1** | ●\n | ●\n | **1** |  |  | ●\n | **1** |  | **1** | ●\n | **1** | **1** | **6** |\n| ![](image) Fencing |  |  |  | **1** | **1** | **1** | **1** | **1** | **2** | **1** | **1** | **1** |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | **10** |\n| ![](image) Field hockey |  |  |  | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | ●\n | **1** | **1** |  | **2** |\n| ![](image) Football | ●\n | ●\n |  | ●\n | ●\n |  | ●\n | ●\n |  | ●\n | ●\n |  | ●\n | ●\n |  | **1** | ●\n | **1** |  | **2** |\n| Gymnastics | ![](image) Artistic\n |  |  |  | ●\n | ●\n | **1** | **1** | **1** | **1** |  |  | **5** | **5** |  |  |  |  |  |  | **18** |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nRomanian gymnast Andreea Răducan ultimately took gold while her teammates, Simona Amânar and Maria Olaru took silver and bronze, respectively.\n\n\n\n#### Day 9: 23 September[edit]\n\n\nBy rowing in the winning coxless four, Steve Redgrave of Great Britain became a member of a select group who had won gold medals at five consecutive Olympics.\n\n\nThe swimming 4 x 100-metre medley relay of B.J.

The Games saw 10,625 athletes compete,[2][3] some 600 more than expected, accompanied by 5,501 team officials from 201 countries,[2] with 301 medal events in 28 different sports.[2] The 2004 Games marked the first time since the 1996 Summer Olympics that all countries with a National Olympic Committee were in attendance, and also marked the first time Athens hosted the Games since their first modern incarnation in 1896 as well as the return of the Olympic games to its birthplace. Athens became one of only four cities at the time to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games on two occasions (together with Paris, London and Los Angeles). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCost per sporting event for Athens 2004 was US$9.8 million. This compares with US$14.9 million for Rio 2016, US$49.5 million for London 2012, and US$22.5 million for Beijing 2008. Average cost per event for the Summer Games since 1960 is US$19.9 million.\n\n\nCost per athlete for Athens 2004 was US$0.3 million. This compares with US$0.4 million for Rio 2016, US$1.4 million for London 2012, and US$0.6 million for Beijing 2008. Average cost per athlete for the Summer Games since 1960 is US$0.6 million.\n\n\nCost overrun for Athens 2004 was 49%, measured in real terms from the bid to host the Games. This compares with 51% for Rio 2016 and 76% for London 2012.

The 2004 Games were generally deemed to be a success, with the rising standard of competition amongst nations across the world. The final medal tally was led by the United States, followed by China and Russia with host nation Greece at 15th place.

Also since 2000, Yugoslavia had changed its name to Serbia and Montenegro and its code from YUG to SCG. Georgia's new flag made its debut at the Olympics by unfurling it at the opening ceremony on 13 August.

Officially there were 301 events in 28 sports as swimming, diving, synchronised swimming and water polo are classified by the IOC as disciplines within the sport of aquatics, and wheelchair racing was a demonstration sport. For the first time, the wrestling category featured women's wrestling and in the fencing competition women competed in the sabre. American Kristin Heaston, who led off the qualifying round of women's shot put became the first woman to compete at the ancient site of Olympia.\n\n\nThe demonstration sport of wheelchair racing was a joint Olympic/Paralympic event, allowing a Paralympic event to occur within the Olympics, and for the future, opening up the wheelchair race to the able-bodied. The 2004 Summer Paralympics were also held in Athens, from 17 to 28 September.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Main ground (no. 1) converted to football pitch, home field of Ethnikos Piraeus F.C.

Finally, popular arguments about \"rotting\" of many of the facilities, appear to ignore the actual utilization of most of these structures.[102][*better source needed*]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Usain Bolt of Jamaica, in his first career Olympic Games, finished fifth in his 200m dash heat in 21.05 seconds, failing to qualify for the second round.

It began with a twenty-eight (the number of the Olympiads up to then) second countdown paced by the sounds of an amplified heartbeat.[21] As the countdown was completed, fireworks rumbled and illuminated the skies overhead. After a drum corps and bouzouki players joined in an opening march, the video screen showed images of flight, crossing southwest from Athens over the Greek countryside to ancient Olympia. Then, a single drummer in the ancient stadium joined in a drum duet with a single drummer in the main stadium in Athens, joining the original ancient Olympic Games with the modern ones in symbolism. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFor the first time, major broadcasters were allowed to serve video coverage of the Olympics over the Internet, provided that they restricted this service geographically, to protect broadcasting contracts in other areas.[19] The International Olympic Committee forbade Olympic athletes, as well as coaches, support personnel and other officials, from setting up specialized weblogs and/or other websites for covering their personal perspective of the Games. They were not allowed to post audio, video, or photos that they had taken. An exception was made if an athlete already has a personal website that was not set up specifically for the Games.[20] NBC launched its own Olympic website, NBCOlympics.com. Focusing on the television coverage of the Games, it did provide video clips, medal standings, live results. Its main purpose, however, was to provide a schedule of what sports were on the many stations of NBC Universal. The Games were shown on television 24 hours a day, on one network or another.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ medalists\n* Scandals and controversies\n\t+ antisemitism\n\t+ colonialism\n\t+ doping\n* Deaths\n\t+ WWI\n\t+ WWII\n* Participation of women\n |\n| Related | * Paralympic Games\n* Continental\n\t+ African\n\t+ Asian\n\t+ European\n\t+ Pacific\n\t+ Pan-American\n* Olympic Esports Series\n* Deaflympics\n* Special Olympics\n* 1906 Intercalated Games\n* Ancient Olympic Games\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThis infrastructure was created and maintained to serve directly more than 150,000 ATHOC Staff, Volunteers, Olympic family members (IOC, NOCs, Federations), Partners & Sponsors and Media.

For the first time ever, the flame travelled around the world in a relay to various Summer Olympic host cities (past and future) and other large cities, before returning to Greece.\n\n\n\n## Mascots[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA young Greek girl, 10-year-old Fotini Papaleonidopoulou, lit a symbolic lantern with the Olympic Flame and passed it on to other children before \"extinguishing\" the flame in the cauldron by blowing a puff of air. The ceremony ended with a variety of musical performances by Greek singers, including Dionysis Savvopoulos, George Dalaras, Haris Alexiou, Anna Vissi, Sakis Rouvas, Eleftheria Arvanitaki, Alkistis Protopsalti, Antonis Remos, Michalis Hatzigiannis, Marinella, and Dimitra Galani, as thousands of athletes carried out symbolic displays on the stadium floor.\n\n\n\n## Medal count[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2004 Summer Olympics medal table\n\n![](image)Army Maj.

The 2004 Olympics had two official mascots: *Athena* and *Phevos* (Greek pronunciation: Athina and Fivos). The sister and brother were named after Athena, the goddess of wisdom, strategy and war, and Phoebus, the god of light and music, respectively. They were inspired by the ancient daidala, which were toy dolls that also had religious connotations.\n\n\n\n## Broadcasting[edit]\n\n\nAthens Olympic Broadcasting served as the host broadcaster for the Games, providing over 35,000 hours of coverage to over 300 television channels around the world. Local rights to the Games were held by ERT which devoted their three channels (ET1, NET and ET3) to more than 24 hours of Olympic coverage.[18]\n\n\n\n### Online coverage[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn the revenue side, the same report estimates that incremental tax revenues of approximately €3.5 billion arose from the increased activities caused by the Athens 2004 Olympic Games during the period 2000 to 2004. These tax revenues were paid directly to the Greek state specifically in the form of incremental social security contributions, income taxes and VAT tax paid by all the companies, professionals, and service providers that were directly involved with the Olympic Games. Moreover, it is reported that the Athens 2004 Olympic Games have had a great economic growth impact on the Greek economy, in the words of the Greek Minister of Finance, is that \"as a result from the cost-benefit analysis, we reach the conclusion that there has been a net economic benefit from the Olympic Games\"\n\n\n\n### Comparison to other Olympic Games[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n41. **^** \"Madonna.com > Home\".

The State's contribution to the total ATHOC budget was 8% of its expenditure against an originally anticipated 14%.\n\n\nThe overall revenue of ATHOC, including income from tickets, sponsors, broadcasting rights, merchandise sales etc, totalled near €2,1 million. The largest percentage of that income (38%) came from media rights.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe upgrades to the Athens Ring Road were also delivered just in time, as were the expressway upgrades connecting central Athens with peripheral areas such as Markopoulo (site of the shooting and equestrian venues), the newly constructed Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport, Schinias (site of the rowing venue), Maroussi (site of the OAKA), Parnitha (site of the Olympic Village), Galatsi (site of the rhythmic gymnastics and table tennis venue), and Vouliagmeni (site of the triathlon venue). The upgrades to the Athens Metro were also completed, and the new lines became operational by mid-summer.\n\n\nEMI released *Unity*, the official pop album of the Athens Olympics, in the leadup to the Olympics.[16] It features contributions from Sting, Lenny Kravitz, Moby, Destiny's Child, and Avril Lavigne.[16] EMI has pledged to donate US$180,000 from the album to UNICEF's HIV/AIDS program in Sub-Saharan Africa.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFile:20040814 30sant Latvia Postage Stamp.jpgLatvian postage stamp to commemorate the 2004 Summer Olympics\nTo commemorate the 2004 Olympics, a series of Greek high value euro collectors' coins were minted by the Mint of Greece, in both silver and gold. The pieces depict landmarks in Greece as well as ancient and modern sports on the obverse of the coin. On the reverse, a common motif with the logo of the Games, circled by an olive branch representing the spirit of the Games.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe medal ceremony for the last event of the Olympics, the men's marathon, was conducted, with Stefano Baldini from Italy as the winner. The bronze medal winner, Vanderlei Cordeiro de Lima of Brazil, was simultaneously announced as a recipient of the Pierre de Coubertin medal for his bravery in finishing the race despite being attacked by a rogue spectator while leading with 7 km to go.\n\n\nA flag-bearer from each nation's delegation then entered along the stage, followed by the competitors *en masse* on the floor. All of them were led by Pyrros Dimas (weightlifter) and Liu Xiang (hurdler).\n\n\nShort speeches were presented by Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, President of the Organising Committee, and by President Dr. Jacques Rogge of the IOC, in which he described the Athens Olympics as \"unforgettable, dream Games\".[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFollowing the artistic performances, a parade of nations entered the stadium with over 10,500 athletes walking under the banners of 201 nations. The nations were arranged according to Greek alphabet making the Philippines, Finland, Fiji, Chile, and Hong Kong the last five to enter the stadium before the Greek delegation. On this occasion, in observance of the tradition that the delegation of Greece opens the parade and the host nation closes it, the Greek flag bearer opened the parade and all the Greek delegation closed it. Based on audience reaction, the emotional high point of the parade was the entrance of the delegation from Afghanistan which had been absent from the Olympics and had female competitors for the first time. The Iraqi delegation also stirred emotions. Also recognized was the symbolic unified march of athletes from North Korea and South Korea under the Korean Unification Flag.[c] The country of Kiribati made its debut appearance at these Games and East Timor made a debut under its own flag. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ![](image) Triathlon (2)\n* ![](image) Volleyball\n\t+ Volleyball (2)\n\t+ Beach volleyball (2)\n* ![](image) Weightlifting (15)\n* ![](image) Wrestling\n\t+ Freestyle (11)\n\t+ Greco-Roman (7)\n\n\n |\n |\n\n\n### Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![USA men's lightweight coxless four at Athens Olympics](image)\n\nUSA men's lightweight coxless four at Athens Olympics\n* ![Archery rounds in the Panathenaic Stadium](image)\n\nArchery rounds in the Panathenaic Stadium\n* ![Roger Federer representing Switzerland in tennis](image)\n\nRoger Federer representing Switzerland in tennis\n* ![Russian Igor Turchin (left) and American Weston Kelsey (right) duel in second round of men's individual épée](image)\n\nRussian Igor Turchin (left) and American Weston Kelsey (right) duel in second round of men's individual épée\n\n\n### Calendar[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter the Parade of Nations, during which the Dutch DJ Tiësto provided the music, the Icelandic singer Björk performed the song \"Oceania\", written specially for the event by her and the poet Sjón.\n\n\nThe opening ceremony culminated in the lighting of the Olympic cauldron by 1996 gold medalist windsurfer Nikolaos Kaklamanakis. Many key moments in the ceremony, including the lighting of the Olympic Cauldron, featured music composed and arranged by New Zealander composer John Psathas.[25] The gigantic cauldron, which was styled after the Athens 2004 Olympic torch, pivoted down to be lit by the 35-year-old, before slowly swinging up and lifting the flame above the stadium.

The new design features the Panathenaic Stadium in Athens[4] rectifying the long-running mistake of using a depiction of the Roman Colosseum rather than a Greek venue.[5] The 2004 Games was the first of two consecutive Olympic games to be held in Southern Europe since the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, and was followed by the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe **2004 Summer Olympics** (Greek: Θερινοί Ολυμπιακοί Αγώνες 2004, romanized: *Therinoí Olympiakoí Agónes 2004*),[b] officially the **Games of the XXVIII Olympiad** (Αγώνες της 28ης Ολυμπιάδας, *Agónes tis 28is Olympiádas*) and also known as **Athens 2004** (Αθήνα 2004), were an international multi-sport event held from 13 to 29 August 2004 in Athens, Greece. The Games saw 10,625 athletes compete,[2][3] some 600 more than expected, accompanied by 5,501 team officials from 201 countries,[2] with 301 medal events in 28 different sports.[2] The 2004 Games marked the first time since the 1996 Summer Olympics that all countries with a National Olympic Committee were in attendance, and also marked the first time Athens hosted the Games since their first modern incarnation in 1896 as well as the return of the Olympic games to its birthplace. Athens became one of only four cities at the time to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games on two occasions (together with Paris, London and Los Angeles). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCost per sporting event for Athens 2004 was US$9.8 million. This compares with US$14.9 million for Rio 2016, US$49.5 million for London 2012, and US$22.5 million for Beijing 2008. Average cost per event for the Summer Games since 1960 is US$19.9 million.\n\n\nCost per athlete for Athens 2004 was US$0.3 million. This compares with US$0.4 million for Rio 2016, US$1.4 million for London 2012, and US$0.6 million for Beijing 2008. Average cost per athlete for the Summer Games since 1960 is US$0.6 million.\n\n\nCost overrun for Athens 2004 was 49%, measured in real terms from the bid to host the Games. This compares with 51% for Rio 2016 and 76% for London 2012. Average cost overrun for the Summer Games since 1960 is 176%.\n\n\n\n### Construction[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n21. **^** \"Master of Olympic Pageantry Prepares One Final Blowout\". *The New York Times*.

The 2004 Games were generally deemed to be a success, with the rising standard of competition amongst nations across the world.

The subsequent pace of preparation, however, made the rush to finish the Athens venues one of the tightest in Olympics history. The Greeks, unperturbed, maintained that they would make it all along. By July/August 2004, all venues were delivered: in August, the Olympic Stadium was officially completed and opened, joined or preceded by the official completion and openings of other venues within the Athens Olympic Sports Complex (OAKA), and the sports complexes in Faliro and Helliniko.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Participating nations\n![](image)Team numbers\nAll National Olympic Committees (NOCs) except Djibouti participated in the Athens Games. Two new NOCs had been created since 2000 and made their debut at these Games (Kiribati and East Timor). Therefore, with the return of Afghanistan (who had been banned from the 2000 Summer Olympics), the number of participating nations increased from 199 to 201. Also since 2000, Yugoslavia had changed its name to Serbia and Montenegro and its code from YUG to SCG. Georgia's new flag made its debut at the Olympics by unfurling it at the opening ceremony on 13 August. It replaces the post-Soviet flag, which had been used since Lillehammer 1994.\n\n\nIn the table below, the number in parentheses indicates the number of participants contributed by each NOC.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe sports featured at the 2004 Summer Olympics are listed below. Officially there were 301 events in 28 sports as swimming, diving, synchronised swimming and water polo are classified by the IOC as disciplines within the sport of aquatics, and wheelchair racing was a demonstration sport. For the first time, the wrestling category featured women's wrestling and in the fencing competition women competed in the sabre. American Kristin Heaston, who led off the qualifying round of women's shot put became the first woman to compete at the ancient site of Olympia.\n\n\nThe demonstration sport of wheelchair racing was a joint Olympic/Paralympic event, allowing a Paralympic event to occur within the Olympics, and for the future, opening up the wheelchair race to the able-bodied. The 2004 Summer Paralympics were also held in Athens, from 17 to 28 September.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Main ground (no. 1) converted to football pitch, home field of Ethnikos Piraeus F.C.

The Mayor of Athens, Dora Bakoyianni, passed the Olympic Flag to the Mayor of Beijing, Wang Qishan. After a short cultural performance by Chinese actors, dancers, and musicians directed by eminent Chinese director Zhang Yimou, Rogge declared the 2004 Olympic Games closed.

Finally, popular arguments about \"rotting\" of many of the facilities, appear to ignore the actual utilization of most of these structures.[102][*better source needed*]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Usain Bolt of Jamaica, in his first career Olympic Games, finished fifth in his 200m dash heat in 21.05 seconds, failing to qualify for the second round.

It began with a twenty-eight (the number of the Olympiads up to then) second countdown paced by the sounds of an amplified heartbeat.[21] As the countdown was completed, fireworks rumbled and illuminated the skies overhead. After a drum corps and bouzouki players joined in an opening march, the video screen showed images of flight, crossing southwest from Athens over the Greek countryside to ancient Olympia. Then, a single drummer in the ancient stadium joined in a drum duet with a single drummer in the main stadium in Athens, joining the original ancient Olympic Games with the modern ones in symbolism. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFor the first time, major broadcasters were allowed to serve video coverage of the Olympics over the Internet, provided that they restricted this service geographically, to protect broadcasting contracts in other areas.[19] The International Olympic Committee forbade Olympic athletes, as well as coaches, support personnel and other officials, from setting up specialized weblogs and/or other websites for covering their personal perspective of the Games. They were not allowed to post audio, video, or photos that they had taken. An exception was made if an athlete already has a personal website that was not set up specifically for the Games.[20] NBC launched its own Olympic website, NBCOlympics.com. Focusing on the television coverage of the Games, it did provide video clips, medal standings, live results. Its main purpose, however, was to provide a schedule of what sports were on the many stations of NBC Universal. The Games were shown on television 24 hours a day, on one network or another.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ medalists\n* Scandals and controversies\n\t+ antisemitism\n\t+ colonialism\n\t+ doping\n* Deaths\n\t+ WWI\n\t+ WWII\n* Participation of women\n |\n| Related | * Paralympic Games\n* Continental\n\t+ African\n\t+ Asian\n\t+ European\n\t+ Pacific\n\t+ Pan-American\n* Olympic Esports Series\n* Deaflympics\n* Special Olympics\n* 1906 Intercalated Games\n* Ancient Olympic Games\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThis infrastructure was created and maintained to serve directly more than 150,000 ATHOC Staff, Volunteers, Olympic family members (IOC, NOCs, Federations), Partners & Sponsors and Media.

The TOC was organized in teams (e.g. Systems, Telecommunications, Information Security, Data Network, Staffing, etc.) under a TOC Director and corresponding team leaders (Shift Managers).

Moreover, it is reported that the Athens 2004 Olympic Games have had a great economic growth impact on the Greek economy, in the words of the Greek Minister of Finance, is that \"as a result from the cost-benefit analysis, we reach the conclusion that there has been a net economic benefit from the Olympic Games\"\n\n\n\n### Comparison to other Olympic Games[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n41. **^** \"Madonna.com > Home\".

The upgrades to the Athens Metro were also completed, and the new lines became operational by mid-summer.\n\n\nEMI released *Unity*, the official pop album of the Athens Olympics, in the leadup to the Olympics.[16] It features contributions from Sting, Lenny Kravitz, Moby, Destiny's Child, and Avril Lavigne.[16] EMI has pledged to donate US$180,000 from the album to UNICEF's HIV/AIDS program in Sub-Saharan Africa.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFile:20040814 30sant Latvia Postage Stamp.jpgLatvian postage stamp to commemorate the 2004 Summer Olympics\nTo commemorate the 2004 Olympics, a series of Greek high value euro collectors' coins were minted by the Mint of Greece, in both silver and gold. The pieces depict landmarks in Greece as well as ancient and modern sports on the obverse of the coin. On the reverse, a common motif with the logo of the Games, circled by an olive branch representing the spirit of the Games.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe medal ceremony for the last event of the Olympics, the men's marathon, was conducted, with Stefano Baldini from Italy as the winner. The bronze medal winner, Vanderlei Cordeiro de Lima of Brazil, was simultaneously announced as a recipient of the Pierre de Coubertin medal for his bravery in finishing the race despite being attacked by a rogue spectator while leading with 7 km to go.\n\n\nA flag-bearer from each nation's delegation then entered along the stage, followed by the competitors *en masse* on the floor. All of them were led by Pyrros Dimas (weightlifter) and Liu Xiang (hurdler).\n\n\nShort speeches were presented by Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, President of the Organising Committee, and by President Dr. Jacques Rogge of the IOC, in which he described the Athens Olympics as \"unforgettable, dream Games\".[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFollowing the artistic performances, a parade of nations entered the stadium with over 10,500 athletes walking under the banners of 201 nations. The nations were arranged according to Greek alphabet making the Philippines, Finland, Fiji, Chile, and Hong Kong the last five to enter the stadium before the Greek delegation. On this occasion, in observance of the tradition that the delegation of Greece opens the parade and the host nation closes it, the Greek flag bearer opened the parade and all the Greek delegation closed it. Based on audience reaction, the emotional high point of the parade was the entrance of the delegation from Afghanistan which had been absent from the Olympics and had female competitors for the first time. The Iraqi delegation also stirred emotions. Also recognized was the symbolic unified march of athletes from North Korea and South Korea under the Korean Unification Flag.[c] The country of Kiribati made its debut appearance at these Games and East Timor made a debut under its own flag. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ![](image) Triathlon (2)\n* ![](image) Volleyball\n\t+ Volleyball (2)\n\t+ Beach volleyball (2)\n* ![](image) Weightlifting (15)\n* ![](image) Wrestling\n\t+ Freestyle (11)\n\t+ Greco-Roman (7)\n\n\n |\n |\n\n\n### Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![USA men's lightweight coxless four at Athens Olympics](image)\n\nUSA men's lightweight coxless four at Athens Olympics\n* ![Archery rounds in the Panathenaic Stadium](image)\n\nArchery rounds in the Panathenaic Stadium\n* ![Roger Federer representing Switzerland in tennis](image)\n\nRoger Federer representing Switzerland in tennis\n* ![Russian Igor Turchin (left) and American Weston Kelsey (right) duel in second round of men's individual épée](image)\n\nRussian Igor Turchin (left) and American Weston Kelsey (right) duel in second round of men's individual épée\n\n\n### Calendar[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter the Parade of Nations, during which the Dutch DJ Tiësto provided the music, the Icelandic singer Björk performed the song \"Oceania\", written specially for the event by her and the poet Sjón.\n\n\nThe opening ceremony culminated in the lighting of the Olympic cauldron by 1996 gold medalist windsurfer Nikolaos Kaklamanakis. Many key moments in the ceremony, including the lighting of the Olympic Cauldron, featured music composed and arranged by New Zealander composer John Psathas.[25] The gigantic cauldron, which was styled after the Athens 2004 Olympic torch, pivoted down to be lit by the 35-year-old, before slowly swinging up and lifting the flame above the stadium. Following this, a fireworks display commenced to conclude the ceremony.\n\n\n\n### Participating National Olympic Committees[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*All times are in Eastern European Summer Time (UTC+3)*\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **OC** | Opening ceremony |  ●  | Event competitions | **1** | Gold medal events | **CC** | Closing ceremony\n |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![](image) National Olympic Committees at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece\n |\n| --- |\n| Africa | * Algeria\n* Angola\n* Benin\n* Botswana\n* Burkina Faso\n* Burundi\n* Cameroon\n* Cape Verde\n* Central African Republic\n* Chad\n* Comoros\n* Republic of the Congo\n* Democratic Republic of the Congo\n* Egypt\n* Equatorial Guinea\n* Eritrea\n* Ethiopia\n* Gabon\n* The Gambia\n* Ghana\n* Guinea\n* Guinea-Bissau\n* Ivory Coast\n* Kenya\n* Lesotho\n* Liberia\n* Libya\n* Madagascar\n* Malawi\n* Mali\n* Mauritania\n* Mauritius\n* Morocco\n* Mozambique\n* Namibia\n* Niger\n* Nigeria\n* Rwanda\n* São Tomé and Príncipe\n* Senegal\n* Seychelles\n* Sierra Leone\n* Somalia\n* South Africa\n* Sudan\n* Swaziland\n* Tanzania\n* Togo\n* Tunisia\n* Uganda\n* Zambia\n* Zimbabwe\n |\n| America | * Antigua and Barbuda\n* Argentina\n* Aruba\n* Bahamas\n* Barbados\n* Belize\n* Bermuda\n* Bolivia\n* Brazil\n* British Virgin Islands\n* Canada\n* Cayman Islands\n* Chile\n* Colombia\n* Costa Rica\n* Cuba\n* Dominica\n* Dominican Republic\n* Ecuador\n* El Salvador\n* Grenada\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThese improvements included the establishment of Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport, a modern new international airport serving as Greece's main aviation gateway;[28] expansions to the Athens Metro[29] system; the \"Tram\", a new metropolitan tram (light rail) system[30] system; the \"Proastiakos\", a new suburban railway system linking the airport and suburban towns to the city of Athens; the \"Attiki Odos\", a new toll motorway encircling the city,[31] and the conversion of streets into pedestrianized walkways in the historic center of Athens which link several of the city's main tourist sites, including the Parthenon and the Panathenaic Stadium (the site of the first modern Olympic Games in 1896).[32][33] All of the above infrastructure is still in use to this day, and there have been continued expansions and proposals to expand Athens' metro, tram, suburban rail and motorway network, the airport, as well as further plans to pedestrianize more thoroughfares in the historic center of Athens.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Liu Xiang won the first ever gold medal in men's track and field for China in the 110 m hurdles, equalling Colin Jackson's 1993 World Record time of 12.91 seconds.\n* Kenyan runners swept the medals in the 3000 meters steeple chase.[27]\n* The Olympics saw Afghanistan's first return to the Games since 1996 (it was banned due to the Taliban's extremist attitudes towards women, but was reinstated in 2002).\n* Hicham El Guerrouj wins gold in the 1500 m and 5000 m.

Prior to the session, five other cities (Bangkok, Cairo, Havana, Kuala Lumpur, and Seville) had submitted bids to the IOC, but failed to make the short list chosen by the IOC Executive Committee in 2000. After the first round of voting, Beijing held a significant lead over the other four candidates. Osaka received only six votes and was eliminated. In the second round, Beijing was supported by a majority of voters, eliminating the need for subsequent rounds.[11] Toronto's bid was its fifth failure since 1960 (failed bids for 1960, 1964, 1976 and 1996 Games, losing to Rome, Tokyo, Montreal and Atlanta).[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe showpiece of the 2008 Summer Olympics was the Beijing National Stadium, nicknamed \"The Bird's Nest\" because of its nest-like skeletal structure.

The Guangdong Olympic Stadium was originally planned, constructed, and completed in 2001 to help host the Games, but a decision was made to construct a new stadium in Beijing.[26] In 2001, the city held a bidding process to select the best arena design. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Chaoyang Park Beach Volleyball Ground\n* BMX Field\n* Triathlon Venue\n* Urban Road Cycling Course\n |\n| Venues outside Beijing | * Qingdao International Sailing Centre\n* Shanghai Stadium\n* Qinhuangdao Olympic Sports Center Stadium\n* Hong Kong Equestrian Venues\n* Tianjin Olympic Center Stadium\n* Shenyang Olympic Sports Center Stadium\n |\n\n\n\n\n\n| Authority control databases ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n |\n| --- |\n| International | * VIAF\n |\n| National | * Germany\n* Israel\n* United States\n* Czech Republic\n |\n\nPortals:* ![](image) 2000s\n* ![](image) Olympics\n* ![flag](image) China\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** The official logo for the 2008 Summer Olympics, featuring a depiction of the Chinese pictogram \"京\", from the word **Beijing** (**北京**) representing a dancing human figure, in reference to the host city.

These were also the second Summer Olympic Games to be held in a communist state, the first being the 1980 Summer Olympics in the Soviet Union (with venues in Russia, Ukraine, Byelorussia, and Estonia).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBeijing was awarded the 2008 Games over four competitors on 13 July 2001, having won a majority of votes from members of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) after two rounds of voting.[3] The Government of the People's Republic of China promoted the 2008 Games and invested heavily in new facilities and transport systems. 37 venues were used to host the events, including twelve constructed specifically for the 2008 Games. The equestrian events were held in Hong Kong, making these the third Olympics for which the events were held under the jurisdiction of two different NOCs.[d] The sailing events were contested in Qingdao, while the football events took place across several different cities.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n151. **^** Appelbaum, Binyamin (5 August 2014). \"Does Hosting the Olympics Actually Pay Off?\". *The New York Times*.

The 2008 Olympics were watched by 3.5 billion people worldwide, and featured the longest distance for an Olympic Torch relay.[4][5] The 2008 Games also set numerous world and Olympic records, and were the most expensive Summer Olympics of all time, and the second most expensive overall, after the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi.[6][7] The opening ceremony was lauded by spectators and numerous international presses as spectacular, spellbinding, and by many accounts, \"the greatest ever in the history of Olympics\".[8][9][10] Beijing hosted the 2022 Winter Olympics, making it the first city ever to host both the Summer and Winter Games.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThis Olympic Games marked the return of the Summer Olympic Games to Asia after the 1988 Olympics in South Korea.

It was also the first Olympics for Nepal as a republic, the Marshall Islands and Tuvalu. Mongolia and Panama each won their first ever Olympic gold medal. In addition, Afghanistan, Mauritius, Serbia, Sudan, Tajikistan and Togo won their first ever Olympic medals at these Games.

Other sectors such as manufacturing lost revenue because of plant closings related to the government's efforts to improve air quality. Four years after the Games, many of the specially constructed facilities were underused or even deserted.[149] It is generally expected by economists that there will be no lasting effects on Beijing's economy from the Games.[150] One 2009 study found that countries that host the Olympics experience a significant boost in trade, but this is also the case for countries which merely bid to host: \"The benefit, in other words, came from the signal that a country was open for business, not from the spending itself.\"[151]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Olympic Games portal\n\n\n* 2008 Summer Paralympics\n* Olympic Games celebrated in China\n\t+ 2008 Summer Olympics – Beijing\n\t+ 2014 Summer Youth Olympics – Nanjing\n\t+ 2022 Winter Olympics – Beijing\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n38. **^** Yardley, Jim (13 August 2007). \"Beijing Olympics: Let the politics begin\". *The New York Times*.

Several expressways encircle the center of the city, providing for quick transportation around the city and between venues.\nTo prepare for Olympic visitors, Beijing's transportation infrastructure was expanded. Beijing's airport underwent a major renovation with the addition of the new Terminal 3, designed by architect Norman Foster.[30] Within the city itself, Beijing's subway was doubled in capacity and length, with the addition of seven lines and 80 stations to the previously existing four lines and 64 stations. Included in this expansion was a new link connecting to the city's airport. A fleet of thousands of buses, minibuses, and official cars transported spectators, athletes, and officials between venues.[31][32]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe program for the Beijing Games was quite similar to that of the 2004 Summer Olympics held in Athens. There were 28 sports and 302 events at the 2008 Games. Nine new events were held, including two from the new cycling discipline of BMX. Women competed in the 3,000-meter (9,843 ft) steeplechase for the first time. Open water swimming events for men and women, over the distance of 10 kilometers (6.2 mi), were added to the swimming discipline. Team events (men and women) in table tennis replaced the doubles events.[92] In fencing, the women's team foil and women's team saber replaced men's team foil and women's team épée.[f] Two sports were open only to men, baseball and boxing, while one sport and one discipline were open only to women, softball and synchronized swimming. Equestrian and mixed badminton are the only sports in which men and women compete together, although three events in the Sailing allowed the opportunity for both males and female participants. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHuman rights concerns expressed by Amnesty International and politicians in both Europe and the United States were considered by the delegates, according to IOC Executive Director François Carrard. Carrard and others suggested that the selection might lead to improvements in human rights in China. In addition, many IOC delegates who had formerly been athletes expressed concern about heat and air quality during the Games, considering the high levels of air pollution in Beijing. China outlined plans to address these environmental concerns in its bid application.[13]\n\n\n\n\n\n2008 Summer Olympics bidding results\n| City\n | Nation\n | **Round 1** | **Round 2** |\n| Beijing | ![](image) China | **44** | **56** |\n| Toronto | ![](image) Canada | 20\n | 22\n |\n| Paris | ![](image) France | 15\n | 18\n |\n| Istanbul | ![](image) Turkey | 17\n | 9\n |\n| Osaka | ![](image) Japan | 6\n | —\n |\n\n\n### Costs[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n108. **^** \"Verbruggen: Opening Ceremony a grand success\".

The open arms of the calligraphic word symbolized the invitation from China to the world to share in its culture.

They went on to claim that surplus revenues from the Games would exceed the original target of $16 million.[15] Other reports, however, estimated the total costs from $40 to $44 billion, which would make the Games \"far and away the most expensive ever\".[16][17][18] Its budget was later exceeded by the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, which suffered from major cost overruns; the 2014 Winter Olympics costed roughly US$50 billion in public funding.[19] The *Oxford Olympics Study 2016* estimates the outturn cost of the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics at US$6.8 billion in 2015-dollars. This includes sports-related costs only, such as those incurred by the organizing committee or those incurred by the host city, country, and private investors to build structures required to host the Games. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The reverse side of the medals of the 2008 Summer Olympics: silver (left), gold (center), bronze (right).

Athletes from China won the highest number of gold medals of any nation at these Games, with 48, thus making China the seventh nation to rank top in the medal table in the history of the modern Olympics, along with the United States (fifteen times), France (in 1900), Great Britain (in 1908), Germany (in 1936), the Soviet Union (six times), and the Unified Team (in 1992).[110]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMembers of the IOC did not disclose their votes, but news reports speculated that broad international support led to China's selection, especially from developing nations that had received assistance from China to construct stadiums. The size of China, its increased enforcement of doping controls, and sympathy concerning its loss of the 2000 Summer Olympics to Sydney were all factors in the decision.[13] Eight years earlier, Beijing had led every round of voting for the 2000 Summer Olympics before losing to Sydney by two votes in the final round.[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n4. **^** The other two instances were the 1956 Summer Olympics, where the equestrian events were held in Stockholm, Sweden, due to strict Australian quarantine rules, and the other Olympic events were held in Melbourne, Australia; and the 1920 Summer Olympics, which were hosted by Antwerp, Belgium, but the final two races of the 12 ft (3.7 m) dinghy event in sailing took place in the Netherlands.\n5. **^** *The New York Times*, for instance, said that \"those promises have been contradicted by strict visa rules, lengthy application processes and worries about censorship.\"[45]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n43. **^** \"Seeing clearly: Panasonic ushers in first HDTV Game\". *China Daily*. 6 July 2007.

The torch was designed to remain lit in 65 km/h (40 mph) winds, and in rain of up to 50 mm (2 in) per hour.[56]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Marshall Islands and Tuvalu gained National Olympic Committee status in 2006 and 2007 respectively, and 2008 was the first Games in which they were eligible to participate.[72][73] The states of Serbia and Montenegro, which participated at the 2004 Games jointly as Serbia and Montenegro, competed separately for the first time since Serbia last participated in 1912. Montenegro made its debut appearance, as the Montenegrin Olympic Committee was accepted as a new National Olympic Committee in 2007.[73] Neighboring Kosovo, however, did not participate. After the declaration of independence in Kosovo, the IOC specified requirements that Kosovo needs to meet before being recognized by the IOC; most notably, it has to be recognized as independent by the United Nations.[74][75][76] However, it has since been recognised by the IOC in 2014 without fulfilling this criteria and made its debut in the 2016 games.[77]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![](image) National Olympic Committees at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China\n |\n| --- |\n| Africa | * Algeria\n* Angola\n* Benin\n* Botswana\n* Burkina Faso\n* Burundi\n* Cameroon\n* Cape Verde\n* Central African Republic\n* Chad\n* Comoros\n* Republic of the Congo\n* Democratic Republic of the Congo\n* Djibouti\n* Egypt\n* Equatorial Guinea\n* Eritrea\n* Ethiopia\n* Gabon\n* The Gambia\n* Ghana\n* Guinea\n* Guinea-Bissau\n* Ivory Coast\n* Kenya\n* Lesotho\n* Liberia\n* Libya\n* Madagascar\n* Malawi\n* Mali\n* Mauritania\n* Mauritius\n* Morocco\n* Mozambique\n* Namibia\n* Niger\n* Nigeria\n* Rwanda\n* São Tomé and Príncipe\n* Senegal\n* Seychelles\n* Sierra Leone\n* Somalia\n* South Africa\n* Sudan\n* Swaziland\n* Tanzania\n* Togo\n* Tunisia\n* Uganda\n* Zambia\n* Zimbabwe\n |\n| America | * Antigua and Barbuda\n* Argentina\n* Aruba\n* Bahamas\n* Barbados\n* Belize\n* Bermuda\n* Bolivia\n* Brazil\n* British Virgin Islands\n* Canada\n* Cayman Islands\n* Chile\n* Colombia\n* Costa Rica\n* Cuba\n* Dominica\n* Dominican Republic\n* Ecuador\n* El Salvador\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn an effort to improve air quality, the city placed restrictions on construction sites and gas stations and limited the use of commercial and passenger vehicles in Beijing.[33] From 20 July through 20 September, passenger vehicle restrictions were placed on alternative days depending on the terminal digit of the car's license plate. It was anticipated that this measure would take 45% of Beijing's 3.3 million cars off the streets. The boosted public transport network was expected to absorb the demand created by these restrictions and the influx of visitors, which was estimated at more than 4 million additional passengers per day.[34]\n\n\n\n### Marketing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2008 Summer Olympics marketing\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n84. **^** \"Iraq banned from Beijing Olympics\". *BBC Sport*. 24 July 2008.

However, the government of Taiwan (then led by the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party) objected to this proposal, claiming that this route would make the portion of the relay in Taiwan appear to be part of the torch's domestic journey through China, rather than a leg on the international route.[68] This dispute, as well as Chinese demands that the flag and the national anthem of the Republic of China be banned along the route led the government of Taiwan to reject the proposal that it be part of the relay route. The two sides of the Taiwan Strait subsequently blamed each other for injecting politics into the event.[69]\n\n\n\n## The Games[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Chronological summary of the 2008 Summer Olympics\n\n### Participating National Olympic Committees[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe mascots of Beijing 2008 were the five Fuwa, each of which represented both a color of the Olympic rings and a symbol of Chinese culture. In 2006, the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games released pictograms of 35 Olympic disciplines (however, for some multidiscipline sports such as cycling, a single pictogram was released).[39][40] This set of sport icons was named *the beauty of seal characters*, because of each pictogram's likeness to Chinese seal script.[40]\n\n\n\n### Mascots[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Fuwa\n\nThe mascots of the 2008 Summer Olympics were the Fuwa, created by Han Meilin (韩美林). The mascots consisted of Beibei, a fish, Jingjing, a panda, Huanhuan, an Olympic flame, Yingying, a Tibetan antelope, and Nini, a sand martin kite. When their Chinese characters are combined, they form 北京欢迎你, or \"Beijing Welcomes You\". A year before the Games in 2007, the 100-episode The Olympic Adventures of Fuwa featuring the mascots, was released.\n\n\n\n### Media coverage[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe relay began 24 March 2008, in Olympia, Greece. From there, it traveled across Greece to Panathinaiko Stadium in Athens, and then to Beijing, arriving on 31 March. From Beijing, the torch followed a route passing through every continent except Antarctica. The torch visited cities on the Silk Road, symbolizing ancient links between China and the rest of the world. A total of 21,880 torchbearers were selected from around the world by various organizations and entities.[61]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n49. **^** Wallace, Lydia. \"100,000 yuan fine for uploading Olympic videos?\".

Prior to the session, five other cities (Bangkok, Cairo, Havana, Kuala Lumpur, and Seville) had submitted bids to the IOC, but failed to make the short list chosen by the IOC Executive Committee in 2000. After the first round of voting, Beijing held a significant lead over the other four candidates. Osaka received only six votes and was eliminated. In the second round, Beijing was supported by a majority of voters, eliminating the need for subsequent rounds.[11] Toronto's bid was its fifth failure since 1960 (failed bids for 1960, 1964, 1976 and 1996 Games, losing to Rome, Tokyo, Montreal and Atlanta).[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe showpiece of the 2008 Summer Olympics was the Beijing National Stadium, nicknamed \"The Bird's Nest\" because of its nest-like skeletal structure.

The equestrian events were held in Hong Kong, making these the third Olympics for which the events were held under the jurisdiction of two different NOCs.[d] The sailing events were contested in Qingdao, while the football events took place across several different cities.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n151. **^** Appelbaum, Binyamin (5 August 2014). \"Does Hosting the Olympics Actually Pay Off?\". *The New York Times*.

The 2008 Olympics were watched by 3.5 billion people worldwide, and featured the longest distance for an Olympic Torch relay.[4][5] The 2008 Games also set numerous world and Olympic records, and were the most expensive Summer Olympics of all time, and the second most expensive overall, after the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi.[6][7] The opening ceremony was lauded by spectators and numerous international presses as spectacular, spellbinding, and by many accounts, \"the greatest ever in the history of Olympics\".[8][9][10] Beijing hosted the 2022 Winter Olympics, making it the first city ever to host both the Summer and Winter Games.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThis Olympic Games marked the return of the Summer Olympic Games to Asia after the 1988 Olympics in South Korea. It was the first Olympics for Serbia as a separate state since 1912 and the first ever for Montenegro, having separated from Serbia in 2006. It was also the first Olympics for Nepal as a republic, the Marshall Islands and Tuvalu. Mongolia and Panama each won their first ever Olympic gold medal. In addition, Afghanistan, Mauritius, Serbia, Sudan, Tajikistan and Togo won their first ever Olympic medals at these Games.

Other sectors such as manufacturing lost revenue because of plant closings related to the government's efforts to improve air quality. Four years after the Games, many of the specially constructed facilities were underused or even deserted.[149] It is generally expected by economists that there will be no lasting effects on Beijing's economy from the Games.[150] One 2009 study found that countries that host the Olympics experience a significant boost in trade, but this is also the case for countries which merely bid to host: \"The benefit, in other words, came from the signal that a country was open for business, not from the spending itself.\"[151]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Olympic Games portal\n\n\n* 2008 Summer Paralympics\n* Olympic Games celebrated in China\n\t+ 2008 Summer Olympics – Beijing\n\t+ 2014 Summer Youth Olympics – Nanjing\n\t+ 2022 Winter Olympics – Beijing\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n38. **^** Yardley, Jim (13 August 2007). \"Beijing Olympics: Let the politics begin\". *The New York Times*.

Several expressways encircle the center of the city, providing for quick transportation around the city and between venues.\nTo prepare for Olympic visitors, Beijing's transportation infrastructure was expanded. Beijing's airport underwent a major renovation with the addition of the new Terminal 3, designed by architect Norman Foster.[30] Within the city itself, Beijing's subway was doubled in capacity and length, with the addition of seven lines and 80 stations to the previously existing four lines and 64 stations. Included in this expansion was a new link connecting to the city's airport. A fleet of thousands of buses, minibuses, and official cars transported spectators, athletes, and officials between venues.[31][32]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe program for the Beijing Games was quite similar to that of the 2004 Summer Olympics held in Athens. There were 28 sports and 302 events at the 2008 Games. Nine new events were held, including two from the new cycling discipline of BMX. Women competed in the 3,000-meter (9,843 ft) steeplechase for the first time. Open water swimming events for men and women, over the distance of 10 kilometers (6.2 mi), were added to the swimming discipline. Team events (men and women) in table tennis replaced the doubles events.[92] In fencing, the women's team foil and women's team saber replaced men's team foil and women's team épée.[f] Two sports were open only to men, baseball and boxing, while one sport and one discipline were open only to women, softball and synchronized swimming. Equestrian and mixed badminton are the only sports in which men and women compete together, although three events in the Sailing allowed the opportunity for both males and female participants. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHuman rights concerns expressed by Amnesty International and politicians in both Europe and the United States were considered by the delegates, according to IOC Executive Director François Carrard. Carrard and others suggested that the selection might lead to improvements in human rights in China. In addition, many IOC delegates who had formerly been athletes expressed concern about heat and air quality during the Games, considering the high levels of air pollution in Beijing. China outlined plans to address these environmental concerns in its bid application.[13]\n\n\n\n\n\n2008 Summer Olympics bidding results\n| City\n | Nation\n | **Round 1** | **Round 2** |\n| Beijing | ![](image) China | **44** | **56** |\n| Toronto | ![](image) Canada | 20\n | 22\n |\n| Paris | ![](image) France | 15\n | 18\n |\n| Istanbul | ![](image) Turkey | 17\n | 9\n |\n| Osaka | ![](image) Japan | 6\n | —\n |\n\n\n### Costs[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n108. **^** \"Verbruggen: Opening Ceremony a grand success\".

The emblem combined a traditional Chinese red seal and a representation of the calligraphic character for \"capital\" (京, also the second character of Beijing's Chinese name) with athletic features. The open arms of the calligraphic word symbolized the invitation from China to the world to share in its culture.

They went on to claim that surplus revenues from the Games would exceed the original target of $16 million.[15] Other reports, however, estimated the total costs from $40 to $44 billion, which would make the Games \"far and away the most expensive ever\".[16][17][18] Its budget was later exceeded by the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, which suffered from major cost overruns; the 2014 Winter Olympics costed roughly US$50 billion in public funding.[19] The *Oxford Olympics Study 2016* estimates the outturn cost of the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics at US$6.8 billion in 2015-dollars. This includes sports-related costs only, such as those incurred by the organizing committee or those incurred by the host city, country, and private investors to build structures required to host the Games. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The reverse side of the medals of the 2008 Summer Olympics: silver (left), gold (center), bronze (right). Each medal has a ring of jade.\nOf the 204 nations that participated in the 2008 Games, 87 earned medals and 54 of those won at least one gold medal, both of these figures setting new records for Olympic Games.[110][111] There were 117 participating countries that did not win any medals. Athletes from China won the highest number of gold medals of any nation at these Games, with 48, thus making China the seventh nation to rank top in the medal table in the history of the modern Olympics, along with the United States (fifteen times), France (in 1900), Great Britain (in 1908), Germany (in 1936), the Soviet Union (six times), and the Unified Team (in 1992).[110]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMembers of the IOC did not disclose their votes, but news reports speculated that broad international support led to China's selection, especially from developing nations that had received assistance from China to construct stadiums. The size of China, its increased enforcement of doping controls, and sympathy concerning its loss of the 2000 Summer Olympics to Sydney were all factors in the decision.[13] Eight years earlier, Beijing had led every round of voting for the 2000 Summer Olympics before losing to Sydney by two votes in the final round.[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n4. **^** The other two instances were the 1956 Summer Olympics, where the equestrian events were held in Stockholm, Sweden, due to strict Australian quarantine rules, and the other Olympic events were held in Melbourne, Australia; and the 1920 Summer Olympics, which were hosted by Antwerp, Belgium, but the final two races of the 12 ft (3.7 m) dinghy event in sailing took place in the Netherlands.\n5. **^** *The New York Times*, for instance, said that \"those promises have been contradicted by strict visa rules, lengthy application processes and worries about censorship.\"[45]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n43. **^** \"Seeing clearly: Panasonic ushers in first HDTV Game\". *China Daily*. 6 July 2007.

Montenegro made its debut appearance, as the Montenegrin Olympic Committee was accepted as a new National Olympic Committee in 2007.[73] Neighboring Kosovo, however, did not participate. After the declaration of independence in Kosovo, the IOC specified requirements that Kosovo needs to meet before being recognized by the IOC; most notably, it has to be recognized as independent by the United Nations.[74][75][76] However, it has since been recognised by the IOC in 2014 without fulfilling this criteria and made its debut in the 2016 games.[77]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![](image) National Olympic Committees at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China\n |\n| --- |\n| Africa | * Algeria\n* Angola\n* Benin\n* Botswana\n* Burkina Faso\n* Burundi\n* Cameroon\n* Cape Verde\n* Central African Republic\n* Chad\n* Comoros\n* Republic of the Congo\n* Democratic Republic of the Congo\n* Djibouti\n* Egypt\n* Equatorial Guinea\n* Eritrea\n* Ethiopia\n* Gabon\n* The Gambia\n* Ghana\n* Guinea\n* Guinea-Bissau\n* Ivory Coast\n* Kenya\n* Lesotho\n* Liberia\n* Libya\n* Madagascar\n* Malawi\n* Mali\n* Mauritania\n* Mauritius\n* Morocco\n* Mozambique\n* Namibia\n* Niger\n* Nigeria\n* Rwanda\n* São Tomé and Príncipe\n* Senegal\n* Seychelles\n* Sierra Leone\n* Somalia\n* South Africa\n* Sudan\n* Swaziland\n* Tanzania\n* Togo\n* Tunisia\n* Uganda\n* Zambia\n* Zimbabwe\n |\n| America | * Antigua and Barbuda\n* Argentina\n* Aruba\n* Bahamas\n* Barbados\n* Belize\n* Bermuda\n* Bolivia\n* Brazil\n* British Virgin Islands\n* Canada\n* Cayman Islands\n* Chile\n* Colombia\n* Costa Rica\n* Cuba\n* Dominica\n* Dominican Republic\n* Ecuador\n* El Salvador\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn an effort to improve air quality, the city placed restrictions on construction sites and gas stations and limited the use of commercial and passenger vehicles in Beijing.[33] From 20 July through 20 September, passenger vehicle restrictions were placed on alternative days depending on the terminal digit of the car's license plate. It was anticipated that this measure would take 45% of Beijing's 3.3 million cars off the streets. The boosted public transport network was expected to absorb the demand created by these restrictions and the influx of visitors, which was estimated at more than 4 million additional passengers per day.[34]\n\n\n\n### Marketing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2008 Summer Olympics marketing\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n84. **^** \"Iraq banned from Beijing Olympics\". *BBC Sport*. 24 July 2008.

However, the government of Taiwan (then led by the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party) objected to this proposal, claiming that this route would make the portion of the relay in Taiwan appear to be part of the torch's domestic journey through China, rather than a leg on the international route.[68] This dispute, as well as Chinese demands that the flag and the national anthem of the Republic of China be banned along the route led the government of Taiwan to reject the proposal that it be part of the relay route. The two sides of the Taiwan Strait subsequently blamed each other for injecting politics into the event.[69]\n\n\n\n## The Games[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Chronological summary of the 2008 Summer Olympics\n\n### Participating National Olympic Committees[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe mascots of Beijing 2008 were the five Fuwa, each of which represented both a color of the Olympic rings and a symbol of Chinese culture. In 2006, the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games released pictograms of 35 Olympic disciplines (however, for some multidiscipline sports such as cycling, a single pictogram was released).[39][40] This set of sport icons was named *the beauty of seal characters*, because of each pictogram's likeness to Chinese seal script.[40]\n\n\n\n### Mascots[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Fuwa\n\nThe mascots of the 2008 Summer Olympics were the Fuwa, created by Han Meilin (韩美林). The mascots consisted of Beibei, a fish, Jingjing, a panda, Huanhuan, an Olympic flame, Yingying, a Tibetan antelope, and Nini, a sand martin kite. When their Chinese characters are combined, they form 北京欢迎你, or \"Beijing Welcomes You\". A year before the Games in 2007, the 100-episode The Olympic Adventures of Fuwa featuring the mascots, was released.\n\n\n\n### Media coverage[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe relay began 24 March 2008, in Olympia, Greece. From there, it traveled across Greece to Panathinaiko Stadium in Athens, and then to Beijing, arriving on 31 March. From Beijing, the torch followed a route passing through every continent except Antarctica. The torch visited cities on the Silk Road, symbolizing ancient links between China and the rest of the world. A total of 21,880 torchbearers were selected from around the world by various organizations and entities.[61]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n49. **^** Wallace, Lydia. \"100,000 yuan fine for uploading Olympic videos?\".

The Paris bid suffered two setbacks during the IOC inspection visit: a number of strikes and demonstrations coinciding with the visits, and a report that a key member of the bid team, Guy Drut, would face charges over alleged corrupt party political finances.[26]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* 2012 Summer Paralympics\n* Olympic Games celebrated in Great Britain\n\t+ 1908 Summer Olympics – London\n\t+ 1948 Summer Olympics – London\n\t+ 2012 Summer Olympics – London\n\n\n* List of IOC country codes\n* 2012 Olympic hunger summit\n* *Twenty Twelve*, a comedy mockumentary featuring a fictional London Olympics committee\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The IOC numbers the Olympiads using Roman numerals.\n2. **^** Athens has also hosted three IOC-organised events, in 1896, 2004 and the Intercalated Games in 1906.

London 2012 went over budget by 76% in real terms, measured from bid to completion. Cost per athlete was $1.4 million.[78] This does not include wider costs for urban and transport infrastructure, which often equal or exceed the sports-related costs.\n\n\nThe costs of staging the Games were separate from those for building the venues and infrastructure and redeveloping the land for the Olympic Park.

They did not contain any scores or rankings, but the report for Paris was considered the most positive. London was close behind, having closed most of the gap observed by the initial evaluation in 2004. New York and Madrid also received very positive evaluations.[30] On 1 July 2005, when asked who would win, Jacques Rogge said, \"I cannot predict it since I don't know how the IOC members will vote. But my gut feeling tells me that it will be very close. Perhaps it will come down to a difference of say ten votes, or maybe less.\"[31]\n\n\nOn 6 July 2005, the final selection was announced at the 117th IOC Session in Singapore. Moscow was the first city to be eliminated, followed by New York and Madrid. The final two contenders were London and Paris. At the end of the fourth round of voting, London won the right to host the 2012 Games with 54 votes to 50.[32]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe closing ceremony was held on 12 August. It featured a flashback fiesta to British music with The Who closing the performance. The ceremony also included a handover of the Olympic flag by Boris Johnson, Mayor of London, to Eduardo Paes, Mayor of Rio de Janeiro, the host city of the 2016 Summer Olympics.[142] In his closing address, Jacques Rogge described the Games as \"happy and glorious\".[21]\n\n\n\n## The Games[edit]\n\n\n### Participating National Olympic Committees[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Number of participating athletes by country \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 300+\n | 100–299\n | 30–99\n | 10–29\n | 4–9\n | 1–3\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n56. **^** \"London 2012 Olympic test event schedule unveiled\". *BBC Sport*. 24 February 2011.

Both the Olympic road races and the mountain bike event were initially considered to be too easy, so they were eventually scheduled on new locations.[49][50] The Olympic marathon course, which was set to finish in the Olympic stadium, was moved to The Mall, since closing Tower Bridge was deemed to cause traffic problems in central London.[51] North Greenwich Arena 2 was scrapped in a cost-cutting exercise, Wembley Arena being used for badminton and rhythmic gymnastics events instead.[52][53][54][55]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLondon's bid featured the same 28 sports that had been included in other recent Summer Olympics, but the IOC voted to drop baseball and softball from the 2012 Games just two days after London had been selected as the host city. There was an appeal, but the IOC voted to uphold the decision, and the two sports were scheduled to be discontinued after their last appearance at the 2008 Olympics.[152] The IOC then voted on whether or not to replace them; karate, squash, golf, roller sports and rugby sevens were considered. Karate and squash were the two final nominees, but neither received enough votes to reach the required two-thirds majority.[152]\n\n\nAlthough formal demonstration sports were eliminated after the 1992 Summer Olympics,[153] special tournaments for non-Olympic sports can be run during the Games, such as the Wushu tournament at the 2008 Summer Olympics.[154] There were attempts to run Twenty20 cricket[154] and netball[155] tournaments alongside the 2012 Games, but neither campaign was successful.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIran lodged a formal complaint with the International Olympic Committee after they claimed that the logo spelt the word 'Zion'.[213] The complaint was dismissed by the president of the IOC, Jacques Rogge, who said that the complaint \"can't be serious.\"[214]\n\n\n\n## Drug testing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Use of performance-enhancing drugs in the Olympic Games § 2012 London\n\nIt was announced before the Summer Games that half of all the competitors would be tested for drugs, with 150 scientists set to take 6,000 samples between the start of the Games and the end of the Paralympic Games.[215] Every competitor who won a medal was also tested. The Olympic laboratory tested up to 400 samples every day for more than 240 prohibited substances.[215] As of late 2022, 40 medals have been stripped due to doping violations, 17 of which were originally awarded to Russian athletes. Testing for drugs was completed by GSK (GlaxoSmithKline).[216]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Olympic Games portal\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n80. **^** \"Volunteering – Making the Games happen\".

After a complicated lottery process, thousands of people failed to secure seats for the events they wanted, but a large number of empty seats were observed throughout the Games, even at some of the most popular events. There was speculation that this was due to a failure of corporate sponsors to make use of tickets they had received.[87]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter use, many of these materials were suitable for anaerobic digestion (AD), allowing them to be made into renewable energy.[123]\n\n\nPost-Games, buildings like the Water Polo Arena were relocated elsewhere. Building parts like roofing covers and membranes of different temporary venues were recycled via VinyLoop. This allowed organisers to meet the standards of the Olympic Delivery Authority concerning environmental protection.\n\n\nLondon 2012 inaugurated Olympic Games guidelines that included the recycling of PVC, which was used for temporary buildings such as the Basketball Arena and for the temporary parts of permanent venues such as the Olympic Stadium.[124] In the Water Polo Arena, PVC roofing was made from recycled cushions to provide insulation.[125] Through this recycling process, the Olympic Games PVC Policy was fulfilled; the policy states:[126]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTest events were held throughout 2011 and 2012, either through an existing championship such as 2012 Wimbledon Championships or as a specially created event held under the banner of *London Prepares*.[56] Team GB House was the British Olympic Association's operational HQ up to and during the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Designed by architects Gebler Tooth on the top floor of an office building in Westfield Stratford City, it combined the team HQ, athletes' \"Friends and Family\" lounge, Press Centre, and VIP lounge.\n\n\n\n### Public transport[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThroughout the process, Paris was widely seen as the favourite, particularly as this was its third bid in recent years. London was initially seen as lagging behind Paris by a considerable margin.[27] Its position began to improve after the appointment of Lord Coe as the new chair of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) on 19 May 2004.[28] In late August 2004, reports predicted a tie between London and Paris.[29]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAccording to Kirsten Henson, Materials Manager for the London 2012 Olympic Park: \"The majority of temporary facilities created for the Olympic Games including the Aquatic centre temporary stands, basketball arena, Water Polo Arena, and the shooting facilities at the Royal Artillery Barracks, are essentially big tents. Basically, PVC stretched over lightweight steel frame. This design solution makes them efficient to install, reduces the need for any significant foundations and are, of course, reusable. We were challenged by the public around the use of PVC; but we considered it to be the right material for certain functions. We therefore challenged the PVC supply chain to have certain environmental performance criteria in place, including a take back and recycle scheme.\"[127]\n\n\n\n### Cultural Olympiad[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 Cultural Olympiad\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)London Olympic Stadium\nIn November 2004, the 200-hectare (500-acre) Olympic Park plans were revealed.[45] The plans for the site were approved in September 2004 by Tower Hamlets, Newham, Hackney and Waltham Forest.[46] The redevelopment of the area to build the Olympic Park required compulsory purchase orders of property. The London Development Agency was in dispute with London and Continental Railways about the orders in November 2005. By May 2006, 86% of the land had been bought as businesses fought eviction.[47] Residents who opposed the eviction tried to find ways to stop it by setting up campaigns, but they had to leave as 94% of land was bought and the other 6% bought as a £9 billion regeneration project started.[48]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![](image) Events at the 2012 Summer Olympics (London)\n |\n| --- |\n| * Archery\n* Athletics\n* Badminton\n* Basketball\n* Boxing\n* Canoeing\n* Cycling\n* Diving\n* Equestrian\n* Fencing\n* Field hockey\n* Football\n* Gymnastics\n* Handball\n* Judo\n* Modern pentathlon\n* Rowing\n* Sailing\n* Shooting\n* Swimming\n* Synchronized swimming\n* Table tennis\n* Taekwondo\n* Tennis\n* Triathlon\n* Volleyball\n* Water polo\n* Weightlifting\n* Wrestling\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTfL defined a network of roads leading between venues as the Olympic Route Network; roads connecting all of the Olympic venues located within London. Many of these roads also contained special \"Olympic lanes\" marked with the Olympic rings—reserved for the use of Olympic athletes, officials, and other VIPs during the Games. Members of the public driving in an Olympic lane were subject to a fine of £130. Additionally, London buses would not include roads with Olympic lanes on their routes.[70][71][72] Concerns were expressed at the logistics of spectators travelling to the events outside London. In particular, the sailing events at Portland had no direct motorway connections, and local roads are heavily congested by tourist traffic in the summer.[73] However, a £77 million relief road connecting Weymouth to Dorchester was built and opened in 2011.[74][75] Some £16 million was put aside for the rest of the improvements.[76]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n200. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Olympic Games partners | The people delivering the Games\".

Up to 35% more bags than normal were expected on 13 August, which was predicted to be the busiest day in the airport's history, according to Nick Cole, head of Olympic and Paralympic planning at Heathrow.\n\n\n\n### Cost and financing[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n119. **^** Urquhart, Conal; Davies, Lizzy (28 July 2012). \"Olympic Torchbearers who lit cauldron kept it secret from parents\". *The Guardian*.

In the UK, the BBC carried the Olympics and Channel 4 the Paralympics. The BBC aimed to broadcast all 5,000 hours of the Games.[168] BBC Parliament's Freeview channel was suspended, BBC Three's on-air time was extended so that it could show Olympic events in the daytime, and 24 additional BBC Olympics channels were available via cable, satellite and the internet in the UK.\n\n\nThe US television rights, owned by NBC, accounted for more than half the rights revenue for the IOC. Despite high viewership, many viewers were disappointed with NBC's coverage.[169] The operations of broadcasters granted rights to the Games were hosted in the dedicated International Broadcast Centre inside the security cordon of the Olympic Park. YouTube planned to stream the Games in 64 territories in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa where there were no official broadcasters.[170]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_4z8VikMgpXgtEIUBvAQc2JIH","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Its members concluded that \"London is ready to host the world this summer\".[40]\n\n\n\n### Venues[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Venues of the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics\n\n![](image)The Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park\nThe 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games used a mixture of new venues, existing and historic facilities, and temporary facilities, some of them in well-known locations such as Hyde Park and Horse Guards Parade.

The Paris bid suffered two setbacks during the IOC inspection visit: a number of strikes and demonstrations coinciding with the visits, and a report that a key member of the bid team, Guy Drut, would face charges over alleged corrupt party political finances.[26]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* 2012 Summer Paralympics\n* Olympic Games celebrated in Great Britain\n\t+ 1908 Summer Olympics – London\n\t+ 1948 Summer Olympics – London\n\t+ 2012 Summer Olympics – London\n\n\n* List of IOC country codes\n* 2012 Olympic hunger summit\n* *Twenty Twelve*, a comedy mockumentary featuring a fictional London Olympics committee\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The IOC numbers the Olympiads using Roman numerals.\n2. **^** Athens has also hosted three IOC-organised events, in 1896, 2004 and the Intercalated Games in 1906.

London 2012 went over budget by 76% in real terms, measured from bid to completion. Cost per athlete was $1.4 million.[78] This does not include wider costs for urban and transport infrastructure, which often equal or exceed the sports-related costs.\n\n\nThe costs of staging the Games were separate from those for building the venues and infrastructure and redeveloping the land for the Olympic Park. While the Games were privately funded, the venues and infrastructure were largely financed using public money.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n152. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Michaelis, Vicki (8 July 2005). \"Baseball, softball bumped from Olympics\". *USA Today*.

They did not contain any scores or rankings, but the report for Paris was considered the most positive. London was close behind, having closed most of the gap observed by the initial evaluation in 2004. New York and Madrid also received very positive evaluations.[30] On 1 July 2005, when asked who would win, Jacques Rogge said, \"I cannot predict it since I don't know how the IOC members will vote. But my gut feeling tells me that it will be very close. Perhaps it will come down to a difference of say ten votes, or maybe less.\"[31]\n\n\nOn 6 July 2005, the final selection was announced at the 117th IOC Session in Singapore. Moscow was the first city to be eliminated, followed by New York and Madrid. The final two contenders were London and Paris. At the end of the fourth round of voting, London won the right to host the 2012 Games with 54 votes to 50.[32]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe closing ceremony was held on 12 August. It featured a flashback fiesta to British music with The Who closing the performance.

Both the Olympic road races and the mountain bike event were initially considered to be too easy, so they were eventually scheduled on new locations.[49][50] The Olympic marathon course, which was set to finish in the Olympic stadium, was moved to The Mall, since closing Tower Bridge was deemed to cause traffic problems in central London.[51] North Greenwich Arena 2 was scrapped in a cost-cutting exercise, Wembley Arena being used for badminton and rhythmic gymnastics events instead.[52][53][54][55]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLondon's bid featured the same 28 sports that had been included in other recent Summer Olympics, but the IOC voted to drop baseball and softball from the 2012 Games just two days after London had been selected as the host city. There was an appeal, but the IOC voted to uphold the decision, and the two sports were scheduled to be discontinued after their last appearance at the 2008 Olympics.[152] The IOC then voted on whether or not to replace them; karate, squash, golf, roller sports and rugby sevens were considered. Karate and squash were the two final nominees, but neither received enough votes to reach the required two-thirds majority.[152]\n\n\nAlthough formal demonstration sports were eliminated after the 1992 Summer Olympics,[153] special tournaments for non-Olympic sports can be run during the Games, such as the Wushu tournament at the 2008 Summer Olympics.[154] There were attempts to run Twenty20 cricket[154] and netball[155] tournaments alongside the 2012 Games, but neither campaign was successful.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIran lodged a formal complaint with the International Olympic Committee after they claimed that the logo spelt the word 'Zion'.[213] The complaint was dismissed by the president of the IOC, Jacques Rogge, who said that the complaint \"can't be serious.\"[214]\n\n\n\n## Drug testing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Use of performance-enhancing drugs in the Olympic Games § 2012 London\n\nIt was announced before the Summer Games that half of all the competitors would be tested for drugs, with 150 scientists set to take 6,000 samples between the start of the Games and the end of the Paralympic Games.[215] Every competitor who won a medal was also tested. The Olympic laboratory tested up to 400 samples every day for more than 240 prohibited substances.[215] As of late 2022, 40 medals have been stripped due to doping violations, 17 of which were originally awarded to Russian athletes. Testing for drugs was completed by GSK (GlaxoSmithKline).[216]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Olympic Games portal\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n80. **^** \"Volunteering – Making the Games happen\".

After a complicated lottery process, thousands of people failed to secure seats for the events they wanted, but a large number of empty seats were observed throughout the Games, even at some of the most popular events. There was speculation that this was due to a failure of corporate sponsors to make use of tickets they had received.[87]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter use, many of these materials were suitable for anaerobic digestion (AD), allowing them to be made into renewable energy.[123]\n\n\nPost-Games, buildings like the Water Polo Arena were relocated elsewhere. Building parts like roofing covers and membranes of different temporary venues were recycled via VinyLoop. This allowed organisers to meet the standards of the Olympic Delivery Authority concerning environmental protection.\n\n\nLondon 2012 inaugurated Olympic Games guidelines that included the recycling of PVC, which was used for temporary buildings such as the Basketball Arena and for the temporary parts of permanent venues such as the Olympic Stadium.[124] In the Water Polo Arena, PVC roofing was made from recycled cushions to provide insulation.[125] Through this recycling process, the Olympic Games PVC Policy was fulfilled; the policy states:[126]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTest events were held throughout 2011 and 2012, either through an existing championship such as 2012 Wimbledon Championships or as a specially created event held under the banner of *London Prepares*.[56] Team GB House was the British Olympic Association's operational HQ up to and during the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Designed by architects Gebler Tooth on the top floor of an office building in Westfield Stratford City, it combined the team HQ, athletes' \"Friends and Family\" lounge, Press Centre, and VIP lounge.\n\n\n\n### Public transport[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThroughout the process, Paris was widely seen as the favourite, particularly as this was its third bid in recent years. London was initially seen as lagging behind Paris by a considerable margin.[27] Its position began to improve after the appointment of Lord Coe as the new chair of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) on 19 May 2004.[28] In late August 2004, reports predicted a tie between London and Paris.[29]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAccording to Kirsten Henson, Materials Manager for the London 2012 Olympic Park: \"The majority of temporary facilities created for the Olympic Games including the Aquatic centre temporary stands, basketball arena, Water Polo Arena, and the shooting facilities at the Royal Artillery Barracks, are essentially big tents. Basically, PVC stretched over lightweight steel frame. This design solution makes them efficient to install, reduces the need for any significant foundations and are, of course, reusable. We were challenged by the public around the use of PVC; but we considered it to be the right material for certain functions. We therefore challenged the PVC supply chain to have certain environmental performance criteria in place, including a take back and recycle scheme.\"[127]\n\n\n\n### Cultural Olympiad[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 Cultural Olympiad\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)London Olympic Stadium\nIn November 2004, the 200-hectare (500-acre) Olympic Park plans were revealed.[45] The plans for the site were approved in September 2004 by Tower Hamlets, Newham, Hackney and Waltham Forest.[46] The redevelopment of the area to build the Olympic Park required compulsory purchase orders of property. The London Development Agency was in dispute with London and Continental Railways about the orders in November 2005. By May 2006, 86% of the land had been bought as businesses fought eviction.[47] Residents who opposed the eviction tried to find ways to stop it by setting up campaigns, but they had to leave as 94% of land was bought and the other 6% bought as a £9 billion regeneration project started.[48]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![](image) Events at the 2012 Summer Olympics (London)\n |\n| --- |\n| * Archery\n* Athletics\n* Badminton\n* Basketball\n* Boxing\n* Canoeing\n* Cycling\n* Diving\n* Equestrian\n* Fencing\n* Field hockey\n* Football\n* Gymnastics\n* Handball\n* Judo\n* Modern pentathlon\n* Rowing\n* Sailing\n* Shooting\n* Swimming\n* Synchronized swimming\n* Table tennis\n* Taekwondo\n* Tennis\n* Triathlon\n* Volleyball\n* Water polo\n* Weightlifting\n* Wrestling\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTfL defined a network of roads leading between venues as the Olympic Route Network; roads connecting all of the Olympic venues located within London. Many of these roads also contained special \"Olympic lanes\" marked with the Olympic rings—reserved for the use of Olympic athletes, officials, and other VIPs during the Games. Members of the public driving in an Olympic lane were subject to a fine of £130. Additionally, London buses would not include roads with Olympic lanes on their routes.[70][71][72] Concerns were expressed at the logistics of spectators travelling to the events outside London. In particular, the sailing events at Portland had no direct motorway connections, and local roads are heavily congested by tourist traffic in the summer.[73] However, a £77 million relief road connecting Weymouth to Dorchester was built and opened in 2011.[74][75] Some £16 million was put aside for the rest of the improvements.[76]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n200. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Olympic Games partners | The people delivering the Games\".

Completed official bid files containing answers to a 25-question IOC form were to be submitted by each city by the deadline of 14 January 2008. On 4 June 2008, two months before the Beijing Olympics, four candidate cities were chosen for the shortlist: Chicago, Madrid, Rio de Janeiro, and Tokyo, which had already hosted the Summer Olympics in 1964. Three cities—Baku, Doha, and Prague—failed to reach the candidature phase. Doha was not promoted, despite scoring higher than the selected candidate city Rio de Janeiro, because of their proposal to host the Olympics in October, outside the IOC's sporting calendar, added with its problems while hosting the 2006 Asian Games, including deaths and illnesses involving athletes and volunteers. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Summer Olympics |\n| --- |\n| Preceded byLondon\n |  **XXXI Olympiad  Rio de Janeiro** 2016\n | Succeeded byTokyo\n |\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nOlympic Games\n |\n| --- |\n| * **Olympic sports**\n* **Olympism**\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe largest venue at the Games in terms of seating capacity was the 74,738-seat Maracanã Stadium, which served as the ceremonies venue and site of the football finals.[14] The second largest stadium was the 60,000-seat Estádio Olímpico João Havelange, which hosted track and field events.[14] The athletes' village was said to be the largest in Olympic history.

They issued a comprehensive technical appraisal for IOC members on 2 September, one month before the elections.[9]\n\n\nMany safeguards were put in place to prevent bidding cities from communicating with or directly influencing the 115 IOC members eligible to vote in the elections. For example, cities could not invite any IOC member to visit, nor could they send anything that could be construed as a gift.

However, the Zika virus was not contracted by anyone competing in or attending the Olympics,[94] and the Games went ahead normally with no major incident.[95][96][97]\n\n\n\n### Political and economic crisis[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2014 Brazilian economic crisis, Operation Car Wash, and Impeachment of Dilma Rousseff\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Medals of the 2016 Summer Olympics\nThe medals were produced by the Casa da Moeda do Brasil (the Brazilian mint). The medal design was unveiled on 15 June 2016. They were designed to be environmentally friendly using recycled materials; the bronze and silver medals contained 30% recycled materials. The gold medals were produced using gold that had been mined and extracted according to a set of sustainability criteria, such as being extracted without the use of mercury. The medals feature a wreath design on the front, and in keeping with tradition, the obverse features Nike, the Greek goddess of victory. A wooden carrying box accompanied each medal. Medalists were also awarded a trophy in the shape of the Games' emblem.[24][25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ![](image) Tennis (5)\n* ![](image) Triathlon (2)\n* ![](image) Volleyball\n\t+ Volleyball (2)\n\t+ Beach volleyball (2)\n* ![](image) Weightlifting (15)\n* ![](image) Wrestling\n\t+ Freestyle (12)\n\t+ Greco-Roman (6)\n\n\n |\n |\n\n\n#### New sports[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 121st IOC Session\n\nIn April 2008, the IOC began accepting applications for two new sports to be introduced to the Olympic programme. Baseball and softball (which were both dropped in 2005), karate, squash, golf, roller sports, and rugby union all applied to be included on the programme. Formal presentations were made to the IOC executive board in June 2009.[50]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe focus on environmental protection also influenced the implementation of certain Olympic protocols. To reduce emissions, the Olympic cauldron was designed to be smaller than previous iterations, using a kinetic sculpture to enhance its appearance in place of a larger body of flames.[36] The bronze and silver medals, as well as the ribbons on all medals, were designed to incorporate recycled materials.[24][25] The athletes were not presented with flowers during the medal ceremonies, as had been the tradition at previous Olympics (although floral displays were still used as part of the staging of medal presentations). The organizers considered the practice to be wasteful because the flowers were often thrown away and \"would struggle to survive in the tropical Brazilian climate\" if kept. The podiums were designed using materials that could be recycled to make furniture.[25][37]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| IOC | Country\n | Athletes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| USA | ![](image) United States | 554\n |\n| BRA | ![](image) Brazil | 465\n |\n| GER | ![](image) Germany | 425\n |\n| AUS | ![](image) Australia | 421\n |\n| CHN | ![](image) China | 413\n |\n| FRA | ![](image) France | 399\n |\n| GBR | ![](image) Great Britain | 366\n |\n| JPN | ![](image) Japan | 338\n |\n| CAN | ![](image) Canada | 314\n |\n| ITA | ![](image) Italy | 309\n |\n| ESP | ![](image) Spain | 306\n |\n| RUS | ![](image) Russia | 282\n |\n| POL | ![](image) Poland | 243\n |\n| NED | ![](image) Netherlands | 242\n |\n| ARG | ![](image) Argentina | 213\n |\n| KOR | ![](image) South Korea | 205\n |\n| UKR | ![](image) Ukraine | 203\n |\n| NZL | ![](image) New Zealand | 199\n |\n| HUN | ![](image) Hungary | 160\n |\n| SWE | ![](image) Sweden | 152\n |\n| COL | ![](image) Colombia | 147\n |\n| RSA | ![](image) South Africa | 137\n |\n| MEX | ![](image) Mexico | 125\n |\n| DEN | ![](image) Denmark | 122\n |\n| BLR | ![](image) Belarus | 121\n |\n| CUB | ![](image) Cuba | 120\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n118. **^** \"USOC, athletes navigate questions swirling around Rio's contaminated water\". *The Washington Post*. 9 March 2016.

Completed official bid files containing answers to a 25-question IOC form were to be submitted by each city by the deadline of 14 January 2008. On 4 June 2008, two months before the Beijing Olympics, four candidate cities were chosen for the shortlist: Chicago, Madrid, Rio de Janeiro, and Tokyo, which had already hosted the Summer Olympics in 1964. Three cities—Baku, Doha, and Prague—failed to reach the candidature phase. Doha was not promoted, despite scoring higher than the selected candidate city Rio de Janeiro, because of their proposal to host the Olympics in October, outside the IOC's sporting calendar, added with its problems while hosting the 2006 Asian Games, including deaths and illnesses involving athletes and volunteers. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Summer Olympics |\n| --- |\n| Preceded byLondon\n |  **XXXI Olympiad  Rio de Janeiro** 2016\n | Succeeded byTokyo\n |\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nOlympic Games\n |\n| --- |\n| * **Olympic sports**\n* **Olympism**\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe largest venue at the Games in terms of seating capacity was the 74,738-seat Maracanã Stadium, which served as the ceremonies venue and site of the football finals.[14] The second largest stadium was the 60,000-seat Estádio Olímpico João Havelange, which hosted track and field events.[14] The athletes' village was said to be the largest in Olympic history.

They issued a comprehensive technical appraisal for IOC members on 2 September, one month before the elections.[9]\n\n\nMany safeguards were put in place to prevent bidding cities from communicating with or directly influencing the 115 IOC members eligible to vote in the elections. For example, cities could not invite any IOC member to visit, nor could they send anything that could be construed as a gift.

However, the Zika virus was not contracted by anyone competing in or attending the Olympics,[94] and the Games went ahead normally with no major incident.[95][96][97]\n\n\n\n### Political and economic crisis[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2014 Brazilian economic crisis, Operation Car Wash, and Impeachment of Dilma Rousseff\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Medals of the 2016 Summer Olympics\nThe medals were produced by the Casa da Moeda do Brasil (the Brazilian mint). The medal design was unveiled on 15 June 2016. They were designed to be environmentally friendly using recycled materials; the bronze and silver medals contained 30% recycled materials. The gold medals were produced using gold that had been mined and extracted according to a set of sustainability criteria, such as being extracted without the use of mercury. The medals feature a wreath design on the front, and in keeping with tradition, the obverse features Nike, the Greek goddess of victory. A wooden carrying box accompanied each medal. Medalists were also awarded a trophy in the shape of the Games' emblem.[24][25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ![](image) Tennis (5)\n* ![](image) Triathlon (2)\n* ![](image) Volleyball\n\t+ Volleyball (2)\n\t+ Beach volleyball (2)\n* ![](image) Weightlifting (15)\n* ![](image) Wrestling\n\t+ Freestyle (12)\n\t+ Greco-Roman (6)\n\n\n |\n |\n\n\n#### New sports[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 121st IOC Session\n\nIn April 2008, the IOC began accepting applications for two new sports to be introduced to the Olympic programme. Baseball and softball (which were both dropped in 2005), karate, squash, golf, roller sports, and rugby union all applied to be included on the programme. Formal presentations were made to the IOC executive board in June 2009.[50]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe focus on environmental protection also influenced the implementation of certain Olympic protocols. To reduce emissions, the Olympic cauldron was designed to be smaller than previous iterations, using a kinetic sculpture to enhance its appearance in place of a larger body of flames.[36] The bronze and silver medals, as well as the ribbons on all medals, were designed to incorporate recycled materials.[24][25] The athletes were not presented with flowers during the medal ceremonies, as had been the tradition at previous Olympics (although floral displays were still used as part of the staging of medal presentations). The organizers considered the practice to be wasteful because the flowers were often thrown away and \"would struggle to survive in the tropical Brazilian climate\" if kept. The podiums were designed using materials that could be recycled to make furniture.[25][37]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| IOC | Country\n | Athletes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| USA | ![](image) United States | 554\n |\n| BRA | ![](image) Brazil | 465\n |\n| GER | ![](image) Germany | 425\n |\n| AUS | ![](image) Australia | 421\n |\n| CHN | ![](image) China | 413\n |\n| FRA | ![](image) France | 399\n |\n| GBR | ![](image) Great Britain | 366\n |\n| JPN | ![](image) Japan | 338\n |\n| CAN | ![](image) Canada | 314\n |\n| ITA | ![](image) Italy | 309\n |\n| ESP | ![](image) Spain | 306\n |\n| RUS | ![](image) Russia | 282\n |\n| POL | ![](image) Poland | 243\n |\n| NED | ![](image) Netherlands | 242\n |\n| ARG | ![](image) Argentina | 213\n |\n| KOR | ![](image) South Korea | 205\n |\n| UKR | ![](image) Ukraine | 203\n |\n| NZL | ![](image) New Zealand | 199\n |\n| HUN | ![](image) Hungary | 160\n |\n| SWE | ![](image) Sweden | 152\n |\n| COL | ![](image) Colombia | 147\n |\n| RSA | ![](image) South Africa | 137\n |\n| MEX | ![](image) Mexico | 125\n |\n| DEN | ![](image) Denmark | 122\n |\n| BLR | ![](image) Belarus | 121\n |\n| CUB | ![](image) Cuba | 120\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n118. **^** \"USOC, athletes navigate questions swirling around Rio's contaminated water\". *The Washington Post*. 9 March 2016.

The Tokyo Organizing Committee is responsible for 22 of the test events, with the remaining events being arranged by national and international sports federations. The first test event was World Sailing's World Cup Series, held at Enoshima in September 2018.

Shortly before the postponement was confirmed, the IOC and Tokyo 2020 organizers formed a task force named \"Here We Go\" with the remit to address any issues arising from postponing the Games, such as sponsorship and accommodation. The organizers confirmed that all athletes who had already qualified for Tokyo 2020 would keep their qualification slots.[48]\n\n\n\n### Calls for cancellation[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMass logging for construction of the Olympic venues received international criticism. Petitions, containing more than 140,000 signatures in total, were delivered to the Japanese embassies in Switzerland and Germany, expressing concerns over claims of using tropical wood sourced from Shin Yang, a Malaysian company with a record of human rights abuses, illegal logging, and rainforest destruction.[245][246] In February 2018, the Olympics Organizing Committee admitted that 87% of plywood panels used to build the new national stadium was sourced from endangered rainforests.[247]\n\n\nPortions of the Games were scheduled for locations impacted by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, and the subsequent Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster.

Of the 46 finalists, Zaha Hadid Architects was awarded the project, which would replace the old stadium with a new 80,000-seat stadium.

On 7 May 2014, NBC agreed to a US$7.75 billion contract extension to air the Olympics through the 2032 games,[223] with the company being one of the IOC's major sources of revenue.[224] Japanese broadcasters were said to have criticized the decision, as swimming is one of the most popular Olympic events in the country.[225][226]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2020 Summer Olympics marketing\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 2020 Summer Olympic Sports program\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| * Aquatics\n\t+ ![](image) Artistic swimming (2)\n\t+ ![](image) Diving (8)\n\t+ ![](image) Marathon swimming (2)\n\t+ ![](image) Swimming (35)\n\t+ ![](image) Water polo (2)\n* ![](image) Archery (5)\n* ![](image) Athletics (48)\n* ![](image) Badminton (5)\n* Baseball\n\t+ ![](image) Baseball (1)\n\t+ ![](image) Softball (1)\n* ![](image) Basketball\n\t+ Basketball (2)\n\t+ 3×3 basketball (2)\n | * ![](image) Boxing (13)\n* ![](image) Canoeing\n\t+ Slalom (4)\n\t+ Sprint (12)\n* ![](image) Cycling\n\t+ BMX freestyle (2)\n\t+ BMX racing (2)\n\t+ Mountain biking (2)\n\t+ Road cycling (4)\n\t+ Track cycling (12)\n* ![](image) Equestrian\n\t+ Dressage (2)\n\t+ Eventing (2)\n\t+ Jumping (2)\n* ![](image) Fencing (12)\n* ![](image) Field hockey (2)\n | * ![](image) Football (2)\n* ![](image) Golf (2)\n* ![](image) Gymnastics\n\t+ Artistic (14)\n\t+ Rhythmic (2)\n\t+ Trampoline (2)\n* ![](image) Handball (2)\n* ![](image) Judo (15)\n* ![](image) Karate\n\t+ Kata (2)\n\t+ Kumite (6)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Games featured 339 events in 33 different sports, encompassing a total of 50 disciplines.

The design was meant to \"express a refined elegance and sophistication that exemplifies Japan\".[227] The checkered design resembles a pattern called *ichimatsu moyo* that was popular during the Edo period in Japan from 1603 to 1867.[228] The designs replaced a previous emblem which had been scrapped after allegations that it plagiarized the logo of the Théâtre de Liège in Belgium. The Games' bid slogan was *Discover Tomorrow* (Japanese: 未来（あした）をつかもう, romanized: *Ashita o tsukamō*). While *ashita* literally means \"tomorrow\", it is intentionally spelled as *mirai*, \"future\".[229] The official slogan *United by Emotion* was unveiled on 17 February 2020.

The first phase of the relay began on 12 March 2020, with the traditional flame lighting ceremony at the Temple of Hera in Olympia, Greece. The torch then travelled to Athens, where the Greek leg of the relay culminated in a handover ceremony at the Panathenaic Stadium on 19 March, during which the torch was transferred to the Japanese contingent.[127] The flame was placed inside a special lantern and transported from Athens International Airport on a chartered flight to Higashimatsushima in Japan. The torch was then expected to begin the second phase of its journey on 20 March, as it traveled for one week around the three most affected areas of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami—Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima—where it would go on display under the heading \"Flame of Recovery\". \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n182. **^** \"IOC Executive Board recommends 25 core sports for 2020 Games - Olympic News\". *International Olympic Committee*. 13 July 2021.

Shortly before the postponement was confirmed, the IOC and Tokyo 2020 organizers formed a task force named \"Here We Go\" with the remit to address any issues arising from postponing the Games, such as sponsorship and accommodation. The organizers confirmed that all athletes who had already qualified for Tokyo 2020 would keep their qualification slots.[48]\n\n\n\n### Calls for cancellation[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMass logging for construction of the Olympic venues received international criticism. Petitions, containing more than 140,000 signatures in total, were delivered to the Japanese embassies in Switzerland and Germany, expressing concerns over claims of using tropical wood sourced from Shin Yang, a Malaysian company with a record of human rights abuses, illegal logging, and rainforest destruction.[245][246] In February 2018, the Olympics Organizing Committee admitted that 87% of plywood panels used to build the new national stadium was sourced from endangered rainforests.[247]\n\n\nPortions of the Games were scheduled for locations impacted by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, and the subsequent Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. The hosting of events in these locations was promoted as a means of furthering recovery in the regions, with the Games sometimes being promoted as the \"Recovery Olympics\".[248][249]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n219. **^** Nee, Liam (28 July 2021). \"Neff leads Olympic-first Swiss sweep of mountain bike podium\". *NBC Olympic broadcasts*.

Of the 46 finalists, Zaha Hadid Architects was awarded the project, which would replace the old stadium with a new 80,000-seat stadium. There was criticism of the Zaha Hadid design—which was compared to a bicycle helmet and regarded as clashing with the surrounding Meiji Shrine—and widespread disapproval of the costs, even with attempts to revise and \"optimize\" the design.[99]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn October 2018, the Board of Audit issued a report stating that the total cost of the Olympic venues could exceed US$25 billion.[105]\n\n\nOf the 33 competition venues in Tokyo, 28 were within 8 kilometers (5 miles) of the Olympic Village, with eleven new venues to be constructed.[106] On 16 October 2019, the IOC announced that there were plans to re-locate the marathon and racewalking events to Sapporo for heat concerns.[107] The plans were made official on 1 November 2019 after Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike accepted the IOC's decision, despite her belief that the events should have remained in Tokyo.[108]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Football stadia | * Tokyo Stadium\n* International Stadium Yokohama\n* Saitama Stadium\n* Kashima Soccer Stadium\n* Sapporo Dome\n* Miyagi Stadium\n |\n\n| Authority control databases ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n |\n| --- |\n| International | * VIAF\n |\n| National | * United States\n* Japan\n* Czech Republic\n |\n\nPortals:* ![](image) Olympics\n* ![flag](image) Japan\n* ![](image) Tokyo\n* ![icon](image) Modern history\n* ![icon](image) Asia\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n92. **^** JR東日本、東京五輪を前に都心部と羽田空港結ぶ新路線整備を on YouTube\n93. **^** \"羽田・成田発着を拡大、五輪へインフラ整備急ぐ\" [Expand departures and arrivals at Haneda and Narita, and hurry to improve infrastructure for the Olympics]. *日本経済新聞* [*Nihon Keizai Shimbun*] (in Japanese). 10 September 2013.

On 7 May 2014, NBC agreed to a US$7.75 billion contract extension to air the Olympics through the 2032 games,[223] with the company being one of the IOC's major sources of revenue.[224] Japanese broadcasters were said to have criticized the decision, as swimming is one of the most popular Olympic events in the country.[225][226]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2020 Summer Olympics marketing\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 2020 Summer Olympic Sports program\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| * Aquatics\n\t+ ![](image) Artistic swimming (2)\n\t+ ![](image) Diving (8)\n\t+ ![](image) Marathon swimming (2)\n\t+ ![](image) Swimming (35)\n\t+ ![](image) Water polo (2)\n* ![](image) Archery (5)\n* ![](image) Athletics (48)\n* ![](image) Badminton (5)\n* Baseball\n\t+ ![](image) Baseball (1)\n\t+ ![](image) Softball (1)\n* ![](image) Basketball\n\t+ Basketball (2)\n\t+ 3×3 basketball (2)\n | * ![](image) Boxing (13)\n* ![](image) Canoeing\n\t+ Slalom (4)\n\t+ Sprint (12)\n* ![](image) Cycling\n\t+ BMX freestyle (2)\n\t+ BMX racing (2)\n\t+ Mountain biking (2)\n\t+ Road cycling (4)\n\t+ Track cycling (12)\n* ![](image) Equestrian\n\t+ Dressage (2)\n\t+ Eventing (2)\n\t+ Jumping (2)\n* ![](image) Fencing (12)\n* ![](image) Field hockey (2)\n | * ![](image) Football (2)\n* ![](image) Golf (2)\n* ![](image) Gymnastics\n\t+ Artistic (14)\n\t+ Rhythmic (2)\n\t+ Trampoline (2)\n* ![](image) Handball (2)\n* ![](image) Judo (15)\n* ![](image) Karate\n\t+ Kata (2)\n\t+ Kumite (6)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Games featured 339 events in 33 different sports, encompassing a total of 50 disciplines.

While *ashita* literally means \"tomorrow\", it is intentionally spelled as *mirai*, \"future\".[229] The official slogan *United by Emotion* was unveiled on 17 February 2020. The slogan was used solely in English.[230]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAll test events originally scheduled to take place from 12 March 2020 onwards were postponed due to COVID-19, with the test event calendar to be reviewed during the preparations for the rescheduled Games.[g][199]\n\n\n\n### Participating National Olympic Committees[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2020 Summer Olympics Parade of Nations\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n115. **^** \"Volunteer names unveiled for Tokyo 2020\".

The first phase of the relay began on 12 March 2020, with the traditional flame lighting ceremony at the Temple of Hera in Olympia, Greece. The torch then travelled to Athens, where the Greek leg of the relay culminated in a handover ceremony at the Panathenaic Stadium on 19 March, during which the torch was transferred to the Japanese contingent.[127] The flame was placed inside a special lantern and transported from Athens International Airport on a chartered flight to Higashimatsushima in Japan. The torch was then expected to begin the second phase of its journey on 20 March, as it traveled for one week around the three most affected areas of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami—Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima—where it would go on display under the heading \"Flame of Recovery\". \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n182. **^** \"IOC Executive Board recommends 25 core sports for 2020 Games - Olympic News\". *International Olympic Committee*. 13 July 2021.
