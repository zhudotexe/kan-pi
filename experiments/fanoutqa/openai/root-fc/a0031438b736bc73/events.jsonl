Wade*. He was also the most senior associate justice by that time.[210][211][212]\n\n\n\n### Government powers and legal structure[edit]\n\n\n#### Court precedent[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n4. **^** Thomas's close early association with Scalia came under scrutiny by critics in multiple law review articles. In November 1996, *Emerge* magazine titled him as \"Uncle Thomas: Lawn Jockey of the Far Right\".[181] Linda Greenhouse observed that Thomas voted with Scalia 91% of the time during October Term 2006, and with Justice John Paul Stevens the least, 36% of the time.[182] Biographer Jan Crawford noted that Scalia often joined Thomas instead of Thomas joining Scalia.[183][184] Biographer Corey Robin has called the idea that Thomas followed Scalia's votes a debunked myth.[185]\n5. **^** Thomas's jurisprudence has also been compared to that of Justice Hugo Black, who \"resisted the tendency to create social policy out of 'whole cloth.'\" According to the same critic, Thomas generally declines to engage in judicial lawmaking, viewing the Court's constitutional role as the interpretation of law, rather than making law.[192][193]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Clarence Thomas\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Official portrait, 2007\n |\n|  |\n| Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States |\n| **Incumbent**\n |\n| **Assumed office** October 23, 1991 |\n| Nominated by | George H.

He became the subject of intense media criticism for his decisions, including from figures that supported his appointment. Having previously experienced scrutiny during his confirmation hearings, Thomas believed in producing results without regard for his public image, a characteristic which embodied his lack of questions during oral arguments. His conservative approach moved O'Connor to take liberal positions but attracted Scalia. He formed a friendship with Justice Byron White, with whom he shared multiple interests, and found support from Justice David Souter.[189][190]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince the death of Antonin Scalia, Thomas has been the Court's foremost originalist, stressing the original meaning in interpreting the Constitution.[7] In contrast to Scalia—who had been the only other consistent originalist—he pursues a more classically liberal variety of originalism.[8] Thomas was known for his silence during most oral arguments,[9] though has since begun asking more questions to counsel.[10] He is notable for his majority opinions in *Good News Club v. Milford Central School* (determining the freedom of religious speech in relation to the First Amendment) and *New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen* (affirming the individual right to bear arms outside the home), as well as his dissent in *Gonzales v. Raich* (arguing that Congress may not criminalize the private cultivation of medical marijuana). He is widely considered the Court's most conservative member.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n21. **^** Foskett 2004, pp. 53.\n22. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Tumulty, Karen (July 5, 1991). \"Sister of High Court Nominee Traveled Different Road : Family: Although Clarence Thomas held her up as a horrible example, Emma Mae Martin defends her life and the choices she made\". *Los Angeles Times*.

Smith have characterized Thomas's philosophy as grounded in a form of black nationalism that sees governmental attempts to address racism as either futile or counterproductive.[287][288][289][290] That view contrasts with the belief that laws should be race-neutral because racial discrimination is no longer a serious problem in the United States.[286]\n\n\nThomas joined the majority in *Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard*, which struck down affirmative action in college admissions. He filed a concurring opinion, which he read from the bench, a rare practice for Supreme Court justices.[291]\n\n\n\n#### Abortion and family planning[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Justice Thomas administers the oath of office to Amy Coney Barrett (Oct 26, 2020)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n121. **^** Yalof, David (2001). *Pursuit of Justices: Presidential Politics and the Selection of Supreme Court Nominees*.

However, Bush's advisors, including Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, considered Thomas inexperienced,[108] and he instead nominated David Souter of the First Circuit Court of Appeals.[65] A year later, Justice Thurgood Marshall announced his retirement on June 27, 1991, and Bush nominated Thomas to replace him.[109][110] Bush announced his selection on July 1, calling Thomas the \"best qualified at this time\".[65] Thornburgh cautioned Bush that replacing Marshall with any candidate who was not perceived to share Marshall's views would make confirmation difficult.[111]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring a 10-year period from February 2006 to February 2016, Thomas read his opinions from the bench but asked no questions during oral arguments.[317][318] He said in 2013 that it was \"unnecessary in deciding cases to ask that many questions ... we should listen to lawyers who are arguing their cases, and I think we should allow the advocates to advocate.\"[319] By May 2020, he had asked questions in two oral arguments since 2006.[320]\n\n\nThomas took a more active role in questioning when the Supreme Court shifted to holding teleconferenced arguments in May 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic;[321][322][323][320] before that, he had spoken during 32 of the roughly 2,400 arguments since 1991.[324] Since the court resumed in-person oral arguments at the beginning of the 2021 term, the justices agreed to allow Thomas to ask the first question to each advocate.[325]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn October 2020, Thomas joined the other justices in denying an appeal from Kim Davis, a county clerk who refused to give marriage licenses to same-sex couples, but wrote a separate opinion reiterating his dissent from *Obergefell v. Hodges* and expressing his belief that it was wrongly decided.[308][309][310] In July 2021, he was one of three justices, with Gorsuch and Alito, who voted to hear an appeal from a Washington florist who had refused service to a same-sex couple based on her religious beliefs against same-sex marriage.[311][312][313] In November 2021, Thomas dissented from the majority of justices in a 6-3 vote to reject an appeal from Mercy San Juan Medical Center, a hospital affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church, which had sought to deny a hysterectomy to a transgender patient on religious grounds.[314] Alito and Gorsuch also dissented, and the vote to reject the appeal left in place a lower court ruling in the patient's favor.[315][316]\n\n\n\n### Oral arguments[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Clarence Thomas at the *Biographical Directory of Federal Judges*, a publication of the Federal Judicial Center.\n* Clarence Thomas at Ballotpedia\n* Issue positions and quotes at On the Issues\n* Appearances on C-SPAN\n* Cornell Law School Biography of Clarence Thomas\n* Oyez, Official Supreme Court media, Clarence Thomas biography\n* Supreme Court Associate Justice Nomination Hearings on Clarence Thomas in September and October 1991 United States Government Publishing Office\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n290. **^** Szalai, Jennifer (September 23, 2019). \"'The Enigma of Clarence Thomas' Makes a Strong Case for Its Provocative Thesis\". *The New York Times*.

As a means to impartiality, he is an advocate of judicial restraint to limit judicial discretion.[191][e] Thomas has been the most-willing of all justices on the Court to overrule precedent; according to Scalia, \"he does not believe in *stare decisis*, period\".[194][195][f] By October 1, 2012, he had written 475 opinions, including 171 majority opinions, 138 concurrences, and 166 dissenting opinions—approximately 10 percent of the 1,772 cases the Court had decided since he was elevated.[197] In 2016, Thomas wrote nearly twice as many opinions as any other justice.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n345. **^** Heyer, Kristin E.; Rozell, Mark J.; Genovese, Michael A.

Thornton*,[j] parties challenged the constitutionality of an amendment to the Arkansas Constitution that added age, citizenship, and residency requirements for congressional service. In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court ruled the amendment unconstitutional, also affirming the previous rulings of both the state's trial court and the Arkansas Supreme Court; Justice Stevens wrote for the majority. Thomas—joined by Justices Rehnquist, O'Connor, and Scalia—dissented in what is to date his lengthiest opinion.[234] He argued that states could impose term limits on members of Congress, as state citizens are \"the ultimate source of the Constitution's authority\".[235] That same year, Thomas concurred in *United States v. Lopez*, which invalidated the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990 for going beyond the Commerce Clause. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn a concurring opinion in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization* (2022), Thomas wrote that \"any substantive due process decision is 'demonstrably erroneous'\",[*citation needed*] and argued that the Supreme Court should go beyond *Roe vs. Wade* and reconsider other substantive due process precedents, including those established in *Griswold v. Connecticut* (1965), *Lawrence v. Texas* (2003) and *Obergefell v. Hodges* (2015). The overturning of these previous decisions would enable states to limit access to contraception, criminalize sodomy, and criminalize same-sex marriage, respectively.[302][303][304]\n\n\n\n#### LGBTQ rights[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **relies excessively on references to primary sources**.

Thomas said he regarded natural law as a \"philosophical background\" to the Constitution.[127][128][129]\n\n\nNinety witnesses testified in favor of or against Thomas.[130] On September 27, 1991, the Judiciary Committee voted 13–1 to send his nomination to the full Senate without recommendation. A motion earlier in the day to give the nomination a favorable recommendation had failed, 7–7,[131] forwarding it to a full Senate vote.[130][132]\n\n\n\n### Anita Hill accusations[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe American Bar Association (ABA) appraised Thomas as \"qualified\" for the Supreme Court.[116][a] The Bush Administration anticipated that the organization would rate Thomas more poorly than it thought he deserved, so pressured the ABA for at least the mid-level qualified rating while simultaneously discrediting it as partisan.[119] The ABA did rate Thomas as qualified, although with one of the lowest levels of support for a Supreme Court nominee.[120][121] It gave its highest rankings to Thomas in integrity and judicial temperament, and a mid-grade in professional competence.[122]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n249. **^** Volokh, Eugene (2001). \"How the Justices Voted in Free Speech Cases, 1994–2000\" (Updated), 48 UCLA L.

Wade*. He was also the most senior associate justice by that time.[210][211][212]\n\n\n\n### Government powers and legal structure[edit]\n\n\n#### Court precedent[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n4. **^** Thomas's close early association with Scalia came under scrutiny by critics in multiple law review articles. In November 1996, *Emerge* magazine titled him as \"Uncle Thomas: Lawn Jockey of the Far Right\".[181] Linda Greenhouse observed that Thomas voted with Scalia 91% of the time during October Term 2006, and with Justice John Paul Stevens the least, 36% of the time.[182] Biographer Jan Crawford noted that Scalia often joined Thomas instead of Thomas joining Scalia.[183][184] Biographer Corey Robin has called the idea that Thomas followed Scalia's votes a debunked myth.[185]\n5. **^** Thomas's jurisprudence has also been compared to that of Justice Hugo Black, who \"resisted the tendency to create social policy out of 'whole cloth.'\" According to the same critic, Thomas generally declines to engage in judicial lawmaking, viewing the Court's constitutional role as the interpretation of law, rather than making law.[192][193]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Clarence Thomas\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Official portrait, 2007\n |\n|  |\n| Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States |\n| **Incumbent**\n |\n| **Assumed office** October 23, 1991 |\n| Nominated by | George H.

He became the subject of intense media criticism for his decisions, including from figures that supported his appointment. Having previously experienced scrutiny during his confirmation hearings, Thomas believed in producing results without regard for his public image, a characteristic which embodied his lack of questions during oral arguments. His conservative approach moved O'Connor to take liberal positions but attracted Scalia. He formed a friendship with Justice Byron White, with whom he shared multiple interests, and found support from Justice David Souter.[189][190]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince the death of Antonin Scalia, Thomas has been the Court's foremost originalist, stressing the original meaning in interpreting the Constitution.[7] In contrast to Scalia—who had been the only other consistent originalist—he pursues a more classically liberal variety of originalism.[8] Thomas was known for his silence during most oral arguments,[9] though has since begun asking more questions to counsel.[10] He is notable for his majority opinions in *Good News Club v. Milford Central School* (determining the freedom of religious speech in relation to the First Amendment) and *New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen* (affirming the individual right to bear arms outside the home), as well as his dissent in *Gonzales v. Raich* (arguing that Congress may not criminalize the private cultivation of medical marijuana). He is widely considered the Court's most conservative member.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n21. **^** Foskett 2004, pp. 53.\n22. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Tumulty, Karen (July 5, 1991). \"Sister of High Court Nominee Traveled Different Road : Family: Although Clarence Thomas held her up as a horrible example, Emma Mae Martin defends her life and the choices she made\". *Los Angeles Times*.

Smith have characterized Thomas's philosophy as grounded in a form of black nationalism that sees governmental attempts to address racism as either futile or counterproductive.[287][288][289][290] That view contrasts with the belief that laws should be race-neutral because racial discrimination is no longer a serious problem in the United States.[286]\n\n\nThomas joined the majority in *Students for Fair Admissions v.

Marshall would later give advice to Thomas after the confirmation.[106][107]\nWhen Justice William Brennan retired from the Supreme Court in July 1990, Thomas was Bush's favorite among the five candidates on his shortlist for the position. However, Bush's advisors, including Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, considered Thomas inexperienced,[108] and he instead nominated David Souter of the First Circuit Court of Appeals.[65] A year later, Justice Thurgood Marshall announced his retirement on June 27, 1991, and Bush nominated Thomas to replace him.[109][110] Bush announced his selection on July 1, calling Thomas the \"best qualified at this time\".[65] Thornburgh cautioned Bush that replacing Marshall with any candidate who was not perceived to share Marshall's views would make confirmation difficult.[111]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring a 10-year period from February 2006 to February 2016, Thomas read his opinions from the bench but asked no questions during oral arguments.[317][318] He said in 2013 that it was \"unnecessary in deciding cases to ask that many questions ... we should listen to lawyers who are arguing their cases, and I think we should allow the advocates to advocate.\"[319] By May 2020, he had asked questions in two oral arguments since 2006.[320]\n\n\nThomas took a more active role in questioning when the Supreme Court shifted to holding teleconferenced arguments in May 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic;[321][322][323][320] before that, he had spoken during 32 of the roughly 2,400 arguments since 1991.[324] Since the court resumed in-person oral arguments at the beginning of the 2021 term, the justices agreed to allow Thomas to ask the first question to each advocate.[325]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn October 2020, Thomas joined the other justices in denying an appeal from Kim Davis, a county clerk who refused to give marriage licenses to same-sex couples, but wrote a separate opinion reiterating his dissent from *Obergefell v. Hodges* and expressing his belief that it was wrongly decided.[308][309][310] In July 2021, he was one of three justices, with Gorsuch and Alito, who voted to hear an appeal from a Washington florist who had refused service to a same-sex couple based on her religious beliefs against same-sex marriage.[311][312][313] In November 2021, Thomas dissented from the majority of justices in a 6-3 vote to reject an appeal from Mercy San Juan Medical Center, a hospital affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church, which had sought to deny a hysterectomy to a transgender patient on religious grounds.[314] Alito and Gorsuch also dissented, and the vote to reject the appeal left in place a lower court ruling in the patient's favor.[315][316]\n\n\n\n### Oral arguments[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Clarence Thomas at the *Biographical Directory of Federal Judges*, a publication of the Federal Judicial Center.\n* Clarence Thomas at Ballotpedia\n* Issue positions and quotes at On the Issues\n* Appearances on C-SPAN\n* Cornell Law School Biography of Clarence Thomas\n* Oyez, Official Supreme Court media, Clarence Thomas biography\n* Supreme Court Associate Justice Nomination Hearings on Clarence Thomas in September and October 1991 United States Government Publishing Office\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n290. **^** Szalai, Jennifer (September 23, 2019). \"'The Enigma of Clarence Thomas' Makes a Strong Case for Its Provocative Thesis\". *The New York Times*.

As a means to impartiality, he is an advocate of judicial restraint to limit judicial discretion.[191][e] Thomas has been the most-willing of all justices on the Court to overrule precedent; according to Scalia, \"he does not believe in *stare decisis*, period\".[194][195][f] By October 1, 2012, he had written 475 opinions, including 171 majority opinions, 138 concurrences, and 166 dissenting opinions—approximately 10 percent of the 1,772 cases the Court had decided since he was elevated.[197] In 2016, Thomas wrote nearly twice as many opinions as any other justice.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n345. **^** Heyer, Kristin E.; Rozell, Mark J.; Genovese, Michael A.

Thornton*,[j] parties challenged the constitutionality of an amendment to the Arkansas Constitution that added age, citizenship, and residency requirements for congressional service. In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court ruled the amendment unconstitutional, also affirming the previous rulings of both the state's trial court and the Arkansas Supreme Court; Justice Stevens wrote for the majority. Thomas—joined by Justices Rehnquist, O'Connor, and Scalia—dissented in what is to date his lengthiest opinion.[234] He argued that states could impose term limits on members of Congress, as state citizens are \"the ultimate source of the Constitution's authority\".[235] That same year, Thomas concurred in *United States v. Lopez*, which invalidated the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990 for going beyond the Commerce Clause. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn a concurring opinion in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization* (2022), Thomas wrote that \"any substantive due process decision is 'demonstrably erroneous'\",[*citation needed*] and argued that the Supreme Court should go beyond *Roe vs. Wade* and reconsider other substantive due process precedents, including those established in *Griswold v. Connecticut* (1965), *Lawrence v. Texas* (2003) and *Obergefell v. Hodges* (2015). The overturning of these previous decisions would enable states to limit access to contraception, criminalize sodomy, and criminalize same-sex marriage, respectively.[302][303][304]\n\n\n\n#### LGBTQ rights[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **relies excessively on references to primary sources**.

Thomas said he regarded natural law as a \"philosophical background\" to the Constitution.[127][128][129]\n\n\nNinety witnesses testified in favor of or against Thomas.[130] On September 27, 1991, the Judiciary Committee voted 13–1 to send his nomination to the full Senate without recommendation. A motion earlier in the day to give the nomination a favorable recommendation had failed, 7–7,[131] forwarding it to a full Senate vote.[130][132]\n\n\n\n### Anita Hill accusations[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe American Bar Association (ABA) appraised Thomas as \"qualified\" for the Supreme Court.[116][a] The Bush Administration anticipated that the organization would rate Thomas more poorly than it thought he deserved, so pressured the ABA for at least the mid-level qualified rating while simultaneously discrediting it as partisan.[119] The ABA did rate Thomas as qualified, although with one of the lowest levels of support for a Supreme Court nominee.[120][121] It gave its highest rankings to Thomas in integrity and judicial temperament, and a mid-grade in professional competence.[122]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n249. **^** Volokh, Eugene (2001). \"How the Justices Voted in Free Speech Cases, 1994–2000\" (Updated), 48 UCLA L.

He was nominated to the high court by President George W. Bush on October 31, 2005, and has served on it since January 31, 2006. After Antonin Scalia, Alito is the second Italian American justice to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court; he is also the eleventh Catholic Supreme Court justice in U.S. history.\n\n\nAlito was raised in Hamilton Township, New Jersey, and was educated at Princeton University and Yale Law School. After graduating from law school, he worked as an assistant attorney general for the Office of Legal Counsel and served as the U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey. In 1990, Alito was appointed as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, where he served until joining the Supreme Court. He has called himself a \"practical originalist\" and has been described as one of the Court's \"most conservative justices\".\n\n\nAlito wrote the majority opinion in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization* (2022), in which the Supreme Court overturned its 1973 abortion rights decision *Roe v. Wade*. He has also written majority opinions in the landmark cases *McDonald v. Chicago*, *Burwell v. Hobby Lobby*, *Murphy v. NCAA*, and *Janus v. AFSCME*.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nAlito was born in Trenton, New Jersey. He was the son of Samuel A. Alito Sr., an Italian immigrant from Roccella Ionica, Calabria, and Rose Fradusco, an Italian-American whose parents came from Palazzo San Gervasio in Basilicata.[1][2][3] Alito's father earned a master's degree at Rutgers University and was a high school teacher and later the first director of the New Jersey Office of Legislative Services, a state government position he held from 1952 to 1984. Alito's mother was a schoolteacher. Both are deceased.[4]\n\n\nAlito grew up in Hamilton Township, New Jersey, a suburb of Trenton.[5] He attended Steinert High School, where he graduated in 1968 as the class valedictorian,[6] subsequently matriculating at Princeton University. In 1972, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts, *summa cum laude*, from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs.[7] His senior thesis, supervised by political scientist Walter F. Murphy, was entitled \"An Introduction to the Italian Constitutional Court\".[8]\n\n\nAt Princeton, Alito chaired a student conference in 1971 called \"The Boundaries of Privacy in American Society\", which supported curbs on domestic intelligence gathering and anticipated the need for a statute and a court to oversee national security surveillance.[9] The conference report itself also called for the decriminalization of sodomy, and urged for an end to discrimination against gays in hiring by employers. Alito also led the American Whig-Cliosophic Society's Debate Panel during his time at Princeton.[10] He avoided Princeton's eating clubs, joining Stevenson Hall instead.[11]\n\n\nIn December 1969, while a sophomore at Princeton, Alito received a low lottery number of 32 in the Selective Service drawing. He became a member of the school's Army ROTC program.[12][a] Alito was commissioned a second lieutenant in the United States Army Reserve in 1972. He began his military duty after graduating from law school in 1975 and served on active duty from September to December while attending the Signal Officer Basic Course at Fort Gordon, Georgia. Alito was promoted to first lieutenant and captain, and completed his service obligation as a member of the inactive reserve before being honorably discharged in 1980.[12]\n\n\nAt Princeton, Alito was \"almost alone\" in his familiarity with the writings of John Marshall Harlan II[14] and was much influenced by the course on constitutional interpretation taught by Walter F. Murphy, also his faculty adviser.[14] During his senior year at Princeton, Alito moved out of New Jersey for the first time to study in Italy, where he wrote his thesis on the Italian legal system.[15] Graduating in 1972, Alito left a sign of his lofty aspirations in his yearbook, which said that he hoped to \"eventually warm a seat on the Supreme Court\".[16]\n\n\nAlito then attended Yale Law School, where he served as an editor of the *Yale Law Journal* and earned a Juris Doctor in 1975.[7]\n\n\n\n## Early legal career[edit]\n\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Alito clerked for Third Circuit appeals judge Leonard I. Garth in Newark, New Jersey, in 1976 and 1977.[15] He interviewed with Supreme Court Justice Byron White for a clerkship but was not hired.[17] Between 1977 and 1981, Alito was Assistant United States Attorney, District of New Jersey.[18] There, he served under the then-chief of the appeals division Assistant U.S. Attorney, Maryanne Trump Barry (Barry later became a federal judge).[19] While an Assistant U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, he prosecuted many cases involving drug trafficking and organized crime.[20]\n\n\nFrom 1981 to 1985, Alito was Assistant to U.S. Solicitor General Rex E. Lee. In that capacity he argued 12 cases before the Supreme Court for the federal government.[21] In *Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists* (1986), the Supreme Court ruled against Charles Fried after he rejected a memo by Alito urging the Solicitor General to avoid directly attacking the constitutional right to an abortion.[22] Alito lost only two of the cases he argued before the Supreme Court.[23]\n\n\nFrom 1985 to 1987, Alito was Deputy Assistant Attorney General under Charles J. Cooper in the Office of Legal Counsel during the tenure of Attorney General Edwin Meese. John F. Manning worked under Alito there.[11] Between 1986 and 1987, Alito authored nearly 470 pages of memoranda, in which he argued for expanding his client's law enforcement and personnel authorities.[24] In his 1985 application for Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Alito espoused conservative views, naming William F. Buckley, Jr., the *National Review*, Alexander Bickel, and Barry Goldwater's 1964 presidential campaign as major influences. He also expressed concern about Warren Court decisions in the areas of criminal procedure, the Establishment Clause, and reapportionment.[25]\n\n\nFrom 1987 to 1990, Alito was the United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey.[26] When he arrived, the office had begun the prosecution of 20 defendants accused of being mob affiliates of Anthony Accetturo.[27] In August 1988, the two-year trial, then the longest federal criminal trial in history, ended in the acquittal of all 20 after less than two days of jury deliberations.[28] Alito soon hired Michael Chertoff as his chief deputy.[28]\n\n\nAfter an FBI agent was shot in the line of duty in 1988, Alito personally handled the trial, assigning himself the then-novice Stuart Rabner as an assistant, and securing the shooter's conviction.[28] In March 1988, Alito sought a rehearing of extradition proceedings against two Indian men, represented by Ron Kuby, who were accused of being terrorist assassins, after Alito discovered that the death threats his prosecutor had received had been sent to her by herself.[29] The prosecutor was later found not guilty of obstruction of justice by reason of insanity, after psychiatrists found she may have suffered from schizophrenia, with up to four distinct personalities.[28][30] In 1989, Alito prosecuted a member of the Japanese Red Army for planning a terrorist bombing in Manhattan.[31]\n\n\nAlito is a member of the Federalist Society, a group of conservative and libertarian lawyers and legal students interested in conservative legal theory.[32]\n\n\n\n## Court of Appeals judge[edit]\n\n\n### Nomination and confirmation[edit]\n\n\nThird Circuit Judges Leonard I. Garth, for whom Alito clerked, and Maryanne Trump Barry, under whom Alito worked as an assistant U.S. Attorney, recommended Alito's judicial nomination to President George H. W. Bush.[19] On February 20, 1990, Bush nominated Alito to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, to a seat vacated by John Joseph Gibbons. The American Bar Association rated Alito \"Well Qualified\" at the time of his nomination. He was confirmed by unanimous consent in the Senate on April 27, 1990,[33][34] and received his commission three days later. As a Third Circuit judge, his chambers were in Newark, New Jersey.[15]\n\n\n\n### Notable opinions[edit]\n\n\nAbortion\n* On a Third Circuit panel, the majority in *Planned Parenthood v. Casey* overturned one part of a law regulating abortion, the provision mandating that married women first inform their husbands if they sought an abortion. Alito, the third judge on the panel, disagreed, arguing that he would have upheld the spousal notification requirement along with the rest of the law.\n\n\nFederalism\n* A dissenting opinion in *United States v. Rybar*, 103 F.3d 273 (3d Cir. 1996), arguing that a U.S. law banning private citizens from owning submachine guns was similar to one struck down by the Supreme Court in *United States v. Lopez* and thus outside the authority of Congress under the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution.\n* A majority opinion in *Chittister v. Department of Community & Economic Development*, 226 F.3d 223 (3d Cir. 2000). This case concerned an employee's claim of wrongful termination under the Family and Medical Leave Act against the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. States are free to maintain sovereign immunity under the U.S. Constitution. Since Pennsylvania had maintained its immunity to such suits, Alito affirmed the lower court's dismissal of the employee's claims.\n\n\nFirst Amendment\n* A majority opinion in *Saxe v. State College Area School District*, 240 F.3d 200 (3d Cir. 2001), holding that a public school district's anti-harassment policy was unconstitutionally overbroad and therefore violated First Amendment guarantees of free speech.\n* A majority opinion in *ACLU v. Schundler*, 168 F.3d 92 (3d Cir. 1999), holding that a government-sponsored holiday display consisting solely of religious symbols was impermissible, but that a mixed display including both secular and religious symbols was permissible if balanced in a generally secular context.\n* A dissenting opinion in *C. H. v. Oliva* (3d Cir. 2000), arguing that the removal and subsequent replacement in \"a less conspicuous spot\" of a kindergartener's religious themed poster was, at least potentially, a violation of his right to free expression.\n\n\nFourth and Eighth Amendments\n* A dissenting opinion in *Doe v. Groody*, arguing that qualified immunity should have protected police officers from a finding of having violated constitutional rights when they strip-searched a mother and her ten-year-old daughter while carrying out a search warrant that authorized the search of a residence.\n* A unanimous opinion in *Chadwick v. Janecka* (3d Cir. 2002), holding that there was \"no federal constitutional bar\" to the \"indefinite confinement\" of a man imprisoned for civil contempt because he would not pay his $2.5 million debt to his wife.\n\n\nCivil rights\n* A majority opinion in *Williams v. Price*, 343 F.3d 223 (3d Cir. 2003), granting a writ of habeas corpus to a black state prisoner after state courts had refused to consider the testimony of a witness who stated that a juror had uttered derogatory remarks about blacks during an encounter in the courthouse after the conclusion of the trial.[35]\n* A dissenting opinion in *Glass v. Philadelphia Electric Company*, 34 F.3d 188 (3rd Cir. 1994), arguing that a lower court did not abuse its discretion in excluding certain evidence of past conduct that defendant had created a hostile and racist work environment.\n* A majority opinion in *Robinson v. City of Pittsburgh*, 120 F.3d 1286 (3rd Cir. 1997), rejecting a female police officer's Equal Protection-based sexual harassment and retaliation claims against the city and certain police officials and rejecting her Title VII-based retaliation claim against the city, but allowing her Title VII-based sexual harassment claim against the city.\n\n\n## U.S. Supreme Court[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Bush looking on, Alito acknowledges his nomination.\nOn July 1, 2005, Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor announced her retirement from the Supreme Court effective upon the confirmation of a successor. President George W. Bush first nominated John Roberts to the vacancy, but when Chief Justice William Rehnquist died on September 3, Bush withdrew Roberts's nomination to fill O'Connor's seat and instead nominated Roberts to the Chief Justiceship. On October 3, Bush nominated Harriet Miers to replace O'Connor. Miers withdrew her acceptance of the nomination on October 27 after encountering widespread opposition.\n\n\nOn October 31, Bush announced that he was nominating Alito to O'Connor's seat, and he submitted the nomination to the Senate on November 10.[36] Alito was unanimously rated \"well qualified\" to fill the Associate Justice post by the American Bar Association's Standing Committee on Federal Judiciary, which measures the professional qualifications of a nominee.[37] The committee rates judges as \"not qualified\", \"qualified\", or \"well qualified\".[38] Leonard Leo was selected to play a role in shepherding Alito's appointment through the Senate.[39]\n\n\nAlito's confirmation hearing was held from January 9 to 13, 2006. Two active-duty members of the Third Circuit, Judge Maryanne Trump Barry and Chief Judge Anthony J. Scirica, testified in Alito's confirmation hearing, as did five senior and retired circuit judges.[40] Alito responded to some 700 questions over 18 hours of testimony. He rejected the use of foreign legal materials in the Constitution, did not state a position on cameras in courtrooms (he had supported them while on the 3rd Circuit), said Congress could choose to outlaw LGBT employment discrimination in the United States if it wished, and told then-Senator Joe Biden (D-DE) that he endorsed a weak version of the unitary executive theory.[41]\n\n\nOn January 24, his nomination was voted out of the Senate Judiciary Committee on a 10–8 party line vote. Democratic Senators characterized Alito as a hard-right conservative in the mold of Clarence Thomas or Robert Bork. Alito professed reluctance to commit to any type of ideology, stating he would act as an impartial referee. He said he would look at abortion with an open mind but would not state how he would rule on *Roe v. Wade* if that decision were to be challenged. \n\n\nDemocrats on the committee asked Alito about his past association with the conservative group Concerned Alumni of Princeton.[42] Alito said that he had listed an affiliation with the group on his application to Ronald Reagan's Justice Department in order to establish his conservative credentials: \"You have to look at the question that I was responding to and the form that I was filling out... I was applying for a position in the Reagan administration. And my answers were truthful statements, but what I was trying to outline were the things that were relevant to obtaining a political position.\"[43] But during the confirmation hearings, he disavowed the group, whose views were criticized as racist and sexist, saying: \"I disavow them. I deplore them. They represent things that I have always stood against and I can't express too strongly.\"[43]\n\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) formally opposed Alito's nomination to the Supreme Court. The ACLU has only taken this step three other times in its entire history, opposing the nominations of William Rehnquist, Robert Bork and Brett Kavanaugh.[44][*better source needed*] In releasing its report[45][*better source needed*] on Alito, ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero said, \"At a time when our president has claimed unprecedented authority to spy on Americans and jail terrorism suspects indefinitely, America needs a Supreme Court justice who will uphold our precious civil liberties. Alito's record shows a willingness to support government actions that abridge individual freedoms.\"[46][*better source needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Alito ceremonially sworn in by Chief Justice John Roberts the day after his confirmation, February 1, 2006.\nDebate on the nomination began in the full Senate on January 25. After a failed filibuster attempt by Senator John Kerry, the Senate confirmed Alito to the Supreme Court on January 31 by a vote of 58–42.[47] All Senate Republicans voted in favor of confirmation except Lincoln Chafee, and all Senate Democrats voted against confirmation except Tim Johnson, Robert Byrd, Kent Conrad, and Ben Nelson. An Independent, Jim Jeffords, voted against confirmation.[48][49] Alito was sworn in as an associate justice of the Supreme Court later that day.[50][51] He became the 110th justice, the second Italian-American,[52][53] the 11th Catholic in the history of the Supreme Court, and the fifth Catholic on the Court at the time he assumed office.[54]\n\n\nBecause Alito joined the Court mid-term, he did not participate in the decisions of most of the early cases in the Court term because he had not heard arguments for them. These decisions were released with an 8-member Court; none were 4–4, so Alito would not have been the deciding vote in any of them if he had participated. Only three of these cases  – *Garcetti v. Ceballos*, *Hudson v. Michigan*, and *Kansas v. Marsh*  – were reargued since a tie needed to be broken.\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nAlito delivered his first written Supreme Court opinion on May 1, 2006, in *Holmes v. South Carolina*, a case involving the right of criminal defendants to present evidence that a third party committed the crime. From the beginning of the Rehnquist Court to the nomination of Justice Elena Kagan, each new justice has been given a unanimous opinion to write as their first Supreme Court opinion; this practice is designed to help \"break in\" new justices so that each justice has at least one unanimous, uncontroversial opinion under their belt.[*original research?*] Alito wrote for a unanimous court in ordering a new trial for Bobby Lee Holmes due to South Carolina's rule that barred such evidence based on the strength of the prosecution's case, rather than on the relevance and strength of the defense evidence itself. His other majority opinions in his first term were in *Zedner v. United States*, *Woodford v. Ngo*, and *Arlington Central School District Board of Education v. Murphy*.\n\n\nIn his first term, Alito compiled a fairly conservative record.[*original research?*] For example, in the three reargued cases (*Garcetti v. Ceballos*, *Hudson v. Michigan* and *Kansas v. Marsh*), Alito created a 5–4 majority by voting with the four other conservative Justices – Chief Justice John G. Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, and Clarence Thomas. He further voted with the conservative wing of the court on *Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon*[55] and *Rapanos v. United States*. Alito also dissented in *Hamdan v. Rumsfeld* alongside Justices Scalia and Thomas.\n\n\nAlito delivered the Supreme Court Historical Society's 2008 Annual Lecture, \"The Origin of the Baseball Antitrust Exemption\". The lecture was published in two journals.[56][57]\n\n\nIn 2013, Alito was considered[*by whom?*] \"one of the most conservative justices on the Court\".[58][59][60] While his voting record is conservative, he does not always join the opinions of the Court's other conservative justices.[*original research?*] On February 1, 2006, in Alito's first decision on the Supreme Court, he voted with the majority (6–3) to refuse Missouri's request to vacate the stay of execution issued by the Eighth Circuit for death-row inmate Michael Taylor. Justices Roberts, Scalia and Thomas were in favor of vacating the stay; Missouri had twice asked the justices to lift the stay and permit the execution.[61] Moreover, despite having been at one time nicknamed \"Scalito\", Alito's views have differed from those of Scalia (and Thomas), as in the Michael Taylor case and various other cases of the 2005 term.[*original research?*] A fierce critic of reliance on legislative history in statutory interpretation,[*citation needed*] Scalia was the only member of the Court in *Zedner v. United States* not to join a section of Alito's opinion that discussed the legislative history of the statute in question. In two higher-profile cases, one involving the constitutionality of political gerrymandering and one involving campaign finance reform (*LULAC v. Perry* and *Randall v. Sorrell*), Alito adopted narrow positions, declining to join the bolder positions advanced by either philosophical side of the Court.[*original research?*] According to a SCOTUSblog analysis of 2005 term decisions, Alito and Scalia concurred in the result of 86% of decisions in which both participated, and concurred in full in 75%.[62] Alito also differed from Scalia in applying originalism flexibly to arrive at conservative outcomes \"with plodding consistency\", rather than following it so strictly as to occasionally produce outcomes unfavorable to conservatives.[63]\n\n\n\n![](image)Alito swearing in Mark Esper as the United States Secretary of Defense in 2019.\nAlito's majority opinion in the 2008 worker protection case *Gomez-Perez v. Potter* cleared the way for federal workers who experience retaliation after filing age discrimination complaints to sue for damages. He sided with the liberal bloc of the court,[*original research?*] inferring protection against retaliation in the federal-sector provision of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act despite the lack of an explicit provision concerning retaliation.\n\n\nAlito joined Thomas in writing a separate dissent in *Obergefell v. Hodges*.[64][65][66] In 2020, Alito wrote a dissent joined by Thomas to *Bostock v. Clayton County*, arguing that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not prohibit discrimination by sexual orientation or gender identity and criticizing the majority's interpretation of Title VII.[67][68] In October 2020, Alito agreed with the other justices on the denial of an appeal filed by Kim Davis, a county clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.\n\n\nOn November 12, 2020, Alito made headlines for comments about the COVID-19 pandemic. Speaking to the Federalist Society, Alito criticized what he called the \"loss of individual liberties\", saying, \"We have never before seen restrictions as severe, extensive and prolonged as those experienced for most of 2020\" and calling the pandemic \"a Constitutional stress test\".[69]\n\n\nAlito has called himself a \"practical originalist\"[70] and is a member of the Court's conservative bloc.[71] He has been described as one of the Court's \"most conservative justices\".[59][58][72][73]\n\n\nAccording to *The New Yorker*, since the 2020 appointment of Justice Amy Coney Barrett, Alito has become \"the embodiment of a conservative majority that is ambitious and extreme\", overruling progressive precedents from the 1960s and '70s that were previously out of conservatives' reach.[63]\n\n\n\n#### Abortion jurisprudence[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Samuel Alito, 2018\nIn 2003, Congress passed the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, which led to a lawsuit in the case of *Gonzales v. Carhart*. The Court had previously ruled in *Stenberg v. Carhart* that a state's ban on partial birth abortion was unconstitutional because such a ban did not have an exception in the case of a threat to the health of the mother. The membership of the Court changed after *Stenberg*, with Roberts and Alito replacing Rehnquist (a dissenter in *Roe*) and O'Connor (a supporter of *Roe*) respectively. Further, the ban at issue in *Gonzales v. Carhart* was a federal statute, rather than a state statute as in the *Stenberg* case.\n\n\nOn April 18, 2007, the Supreme Court handed down a decision ruling the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act constitutional. Kennedy wrote for the five-justice majority that Congress was within its power to generally ban the procedure, although the Court left open the door for as-applied challenges. Kennedy said that the challenged statute was consistent with the Court's prior decisions in *Roe v. Wade*, *Planned Parenthood v. Casey*, and *Stenberg v. Carhart*.\n\n\nAlito joined fully in the majority, as did Roberts. Thomas filed a concurring opinion, joined by Scalia, contending that the Court's prior decisions in *Roe v. Wade* and *Planned Parenthood v. Casey* should be reversed, and also noting that the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act may exceed the powers of Congress under the Commerce Clause. Alito, Roberts, and Kennedy did not join that assertion. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, David Souter, Stephen Breyer, and John Paul Stevens dissented, contending that the ruling ignored Supreme Court abortion precedent.\n\n\nOn May 2, 2022, *Politico* published a leak of a first draft of a majority opinion by Alito that circulated among the justices in February 2022 for the upcoming decision in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization*. The opinion would overturn *Roe v. Wade* and *Planned Parenthood v. Casey*, and would likely either severely restrict access to abortion or make it completely illegal in states with trigger laws.[74] On June 24, 2022, the ruling was handed down. It was mostly identical to the leaked draft, with the addition of replies to the dissenting and concurring opinions. Alito wrote that \"*Roe* was egregiously wrong from the start.\"[75] In July 2022, Alito gave his first public comments on the ruling in a keynote address for Notre Dame Law School's Religious Liberty Initiative in Rome. He mocked several foreign leaders for criticizing the decision, particularly U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, referencing his pending resignation, and Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, who had compared the ruling to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[76][77] During an October 2022 talk at The Heritage Foundation, Alito said that the leaked opinion made some justices \"targets for assassination\", referring to the assassination attempt on fellow Justice Brett Kavanaugh during that year.[78] At the same event, he said that \"questioning [the Court's] integrity crosses an important line\", which many media commentators interpreted as criticism of Kagan's recent statements on the court's overturning of precedent during the past term.[79]\n\n\nIn November 2022, as the investigation into who had leaked the draft opinion was still ongoing, it was revealed that Rob Schenck, an evangelical minister and former anti-abortion activist, had written Roberts a letter about an alleged previous leak of a Supreme Court decision. He wrote that he had been informed of the outcome of *Burwell v. Hobby Lobby* weeks before the June 2014 decision, authored by Alito and favorable to anti-abortion conservatives, was officially announced.[80] Schenck claimed to have heard of the outcome from Gayle Wright, a conservative donor, shortly after she and her husband had lunch with Alito and his wife on June 3, 2014.[80] *The New York Times* claims contemporaneous emails written by Schenck \"strongly suggested he knew the outcome and the author of the Hobby Lobby decision before it was made public.\"[80] In a statement, Alito denied having revealed the outcome or authorship of any decision before its official announcement, but did not dispute that the June 3 lunch with Wright had occurred.[80]\n\n\nOn April 21, 2023, Alito dissented when the Supreme Court reversed a ruling by Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk that would have banned mifepristone (one of two medications used in the emergency contraception medication Plan B) nationwide.[81][82][83]\n\n\n\n#### Free speech jurisprudence[edit]\n\n\nSamuel Alito attending the inauguration of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt.\nAlito has also dissented from the opinions of the Court's conservative justices on free speech cases, one of which, *Snyder v. Phelps*, had to do with Westboro Baptist Church members' right to protest a military funeral.[84] Alito offered the sole dissenting opinion, saying protesters \"were sued under a very well-established tort that goes back to the 19th century, the intentional infliction of emotional, of severe emotional distress. And I thought that this tort constituted a reasonable exception to the First Amendment, but my colleagues disagreed about that.\"[85]\n\n\nIn the 2007 landmark free speech case *Morse v. Frederick*, Alito joined Roberts's majority decision that speech advocating drug use can be banned in public schools, but also warned that the ruling must be circumscribed so as not to interfere with political speech, such as discussion of the medical marijuana debate.\n\n\n\n#### Ethical questions[edit]\n\n\nOn June 20, 2023, Alito published an op-ed in *The Wall Street Journal* challenging the assertions made in a forthcoming *ProPublica* article, claiming that the source \"misleads its readers\".[86][87] The *ProPublica* investigation, published a few hours later, addressed Alito's relationship with billionaire businessman Paul Singer, focusing on a trip Alito and Singer took to a luxury fishing resort in Alaska and suggesting Alito \"violated a federal law that requires justices to disclose most gifts\", such as private jet travel.[88] The article said he should have recused himself in cases involving Singer and that he was obligated to disclose certain benefits as gifts on his 2008 Financial Disclosure Report. Legal ethics experts quoted in *ProPublica* called Alito's behavior \"unacceptable\".[89] Alito's preemptory challenge maintained that *ProPublica*'s charges were invalid.[88] Alito further contended that because of an exemption in the Court's reporting rules for \"personal hospitality\", he was not required to disclose private air transport for social trips.[86] His unconventional decision to bypass reporters' questions and preempt the story via a separate publication took *ProPublica*'s reporters by surprise.[90] The decision to publish the op-ed was criticized both within the *Wall Street Journal* and by media critics, in part because Alito's \"pre-buttal\" lacked fact-checking.[90][91]\n\n\nThe *ProPublica* report on unreported gifts to both Alito and Thomas led several Democratic members of Congress to call for ethics reform for the Supreme Court. This included a Senate Judiciary Committee proposal to establish a code of ethics for the Court.[92] In a July 2023 *Wall Street Journal* opinion column, Alito wrote, \"Congress did not create the Supreme Court [...] I know this is a controversial view, but I'm willing to say it. No provision in the Constitution gives them the authority to regulate the Supreme Court—period.\"[93] This declaration led to further debate among Democratic lawmakers. Senator Chris Murphy asserted that the Constitution gives Congress power to oversee the Court: \"It is just wrong on the facts to say that Congress doesn't have anything to do with the rules guiding the Supreme Court. In fact, from the very beginning, Congress has set those rules.\"[94]\n\n\n\n## Teaching[edit]\n\n\nAs an adjunct professor at Seton Hall University School of Law in Newark from 1999 to 2004, Alito taught courses in constitutional law and an original course on terrorism and civil liberties. In 1995, he received the school's Saint Thomas More Medal \"in recognition of his outstanding contributions to the field of law\".[95] On May 25, 2007, he delivered the commencement address at Seton Hall Law's commencement ceremony and received an honorary law degree from the school.[96]\n\n\nAs a visiting professor at Duke University School of Law, Alito taught Current Issues in Constitutional Interpretation in fall 2011 and a course in the Master of Laws in Judicial Studies program in summer 2012.[97][*better source needed*]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn 1985, Alito married Martha-Ann Alito, a onetime law librarian who met him during his many trips to the library as a law clerk.[15] They have two adult children together. Alito resided with his family in West Caldwell, New Jersey, before his Supreme Court nomination.[98] He has since moved to Alexandria, Virginia.[99]\n\n\nSince Stephen Breyer's retirement in 2022, Alito has been the only military veteran on the Court.[100]\n\n\nIn 2013, as part of the ongoing fallout from the Edward Snowden case, former National Security Agency analyst Russell Tice revealed that during 2002 and 2003 the National Security Agency targeted Alito's phones, and those of his staff and his family, for surveillance.[101][102]\n\n\nAlito is an avid baseball fan and a longtime fan of the Philadelphia Phillies.[103] The Phillie Phanatic was a special guest at his Supreme Court welcome dinner.[104]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Draft numbers were determined in a lottery based on birthdates; a low draft number increased the likelihood of being selected for compulsory military service overseas during the Vietnam War. The highest number called during the war was 215.[13]\n\n## Bibliography[edit]\n\n\n* *Foreword*, 1 SETON HALL CIR.

He was nominated to the high court by President George W. Bush on October 31, 2005, and has served on it since January 31, 2006. After Antonin Scalia, Alito is the second Italian American justice to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court; he is also the eleventh Catholic Supreme Court justice in U.S. history.\n\n\nAlito was raised in Hamilton Township, New Jersey, and was educated at Princeton University and Yale Law School. After graduating from law school, he worked as an assistant attorney general for the Office of Legal Counsel and served as the U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey. In 1990, Alito was appointed as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, where he served until joining the Supreme Court. He has called himself a \"practical originalist\" and has been described as one of the Court's \"most conservative justices\".\n\n\nAlito wrote the majority opinion in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization* (2022), in which the Supreme Court overturned its 1973 abortion rights decision *Roe v. Wade*. He has also written majority opinions in the landmark cases *McDonald v. Chicago*, *Burwell v. Hobby Lobby*, *Murphy v. NCAA*, and *Janus v. AFSCME*.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nAlito was born in Trenton, New Jersey. He was the son of Samuel A. Alito Sr., an Italian immigrant from Roccella Ionica, Calabria, and Rose Fradusco, an Italian-American whose parents came from Palazzo San Gervasio in Basilicata.[1][2][3] Alito's father earned a master's degree at Rutgers University and was a high school teacher and later the first director of the New Jersey Office of Legislative Services, a state government position he held from 1952 to 1984. Alito's mother was a schoolteacher. Both are deceased.[4]\n\n\nAlito grew up in Hamilton Township, New Jersey, a suburb of Trenton.[5] He attended Steinert High School, where he graduated in 1968 as the class valedictorian,[6] subsequently matriculating at Princeton University. In 1972, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts, *summa cum laude*, from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs.[7] His senior thesis, supervised by political scientist Walter F. Murphy, was entitled \"An Introduction to the Italian Constitutional Court\".[8]\n\n\nAt Princeton, Alito chaired a student conference in 1971 called \"The Boundaries of Privacy in American Society\", which supported curbs on domestic intelligence gathering and anticipated the need for a statute and a court to oversee national security surveillance.[9] The conference report itself also called for the decriminalization of sodomy, and urged for an end to discrimination against gays in hiring by employers. Alito also led the American Whig-Cliosophic Society's Debate Panel during his time at Princeton.[10] He avoided Princeton's eating clubs, joining Stevenson Hall instead.[11]\n\n\nIn December 1969, while a sophomore at Princeton, Alito received a low lottery number of 32 in the Selective Service drawing. He became a member of the school's Army ROTC program.[12][a] Alito was commissioned a second lieutenant in the United States Army Reserve in 1972. He began his military duty after graduating from law school in 1975 and served on active duty from September to December while attending the Signal Officer Basic Course at Fort Gordon, Georgia. Alito was promoted to first lieutenant and captain, and completed his service obligation as a member of the inactive reserve before being honorably discharged in 1980.[12]\n\n\nAt Princeton, Alito was \"almost alone\" in his familiarity with the writings of John Marshall Harlan II[14] and was much influenced by the course on constitutional interpretation taught by Walter F. Murphy, also his faculty adviser.[14] During his senior year at Princeton, Alito moved out of New Jersey for the first time to study in Italy, where he wrote his thesis on the Italian legal system.[15] Graduating in 1972, Alito left a sign of his lofty aspirations in his yearbook, which said that he hoped to \"eventually warm a seat on the Supreme Court\".[16]\n\n\nAlito then attended Yale Law School, where he served as an editor of the *Yale Law Journal* and earned a Juris Doctor in 1975.[7]\n\n\n\n## Early legal career[edit]\n\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Alito clerked for Third Circuit appeals judge Leonard I. Garth in Newark, New Jersey, in 1976 and 1977.[15] He interviewed with Supreme Court Justice Byron White for a clerkship but was not hired.[17] Between 1977 and 1981, Alito was Assistant United States Attorney, District of New Jersey.[18] There, he served under the then-chief of the appeals division Assistant U.S. Attorney, Maryanne Trump Barry (Barry later became a federal judge).[19] While an Assistant U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, he prosecuted many cases involving drug trafficking and organized crime.[20]\n\n\nFrom 1981 to 1985, Alito was Assistant to U.S. Solicitor General Rex E. Lee. In that capacity he argued 12 cases before the Supreme Court for the federal government.[21] In *Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists* (1986), the Supreme Court ruled against Charles Fried after he rejected a memo by Alito urging the Solicitor General to avoid directly attacking the constitutional right to an abortion.[22] Alito lost only two of the cases he argued before the Supreme Court.[23]\n\n\nFrom 1985 to 1987, Alito was Deputy Assistant Attorney General under Charles J. Cooper in the Office of Legal Counsel during the tenure of Attorney General Edwin Meese. John F. Manning worked under Alito there.[11] Between 1986 and 1987, Alito authored nearly 470 pages of memoranda, in which he argued for expanding his client's law enforcement and personnel authorities.[24] In his 1985 application for Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Alito espoused conservative views, naming William F. Buckley, Jr., the *National Review*, Alexander Bickel, and Barry Goldwater's 1964 presidential campaign as major influences. He also expressed concern about Warren Court decisions in the areas of criminal procedure, the Establishment Clause, and reapportionment.[25]\n\n\nFrom 1987 to 1990, Alito was the United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey.[26] When he arrived, the office had begun the prosecution of 20 defendants accused of being mob affiliates of Anthony Accetturo.[27] In August 1988, the two-year trial, then the longest federal criminal trial in history, ended in the acquittal of all 20 after less than two days of jury deliberations.[28] Alito soon hired Michael Chertoff as his chief deputy.[28]\n\n\nAfter an FBI agent was shot in the line of duty in 1988, Alito personally handled the trial, assigning himself the then-novice Stuart Rabner as an assistant, and securing the shooter's conviction.[28] In March 1988, Alito sought a rehearing of extradition proceedings against two Indian men, represented by Ron Kuby, who were accused of being terrorist assassins, after Alito discovered that the death threats his prosecutor had received had been sent to her by herself.[29] The prosecutor was later found not guilty of obstruction of justice by reason of insanity, after psychiatrists found she may have suffered from schizophrenia, with up to four distinct personalities.[28][30] In 1989, Alito prosecuted a member of the Japanese Red Army for planning a terrorist bombing in Manhattan.[31]\n\n\nAlito is a member of the Federalist Society, a group of conservative and libertarian lawyers and legal students interested in conservative legal theory.[32]\n\n\n\n## Court of Appeals judge[edit]\n\n\n### Nomination and confirmation[edit]\n\n\nThird Circuit Judges Leonard I. Garth, for whom Alito clerked, and Maryanne Trump Barry, under whom Alito worked as an assistant U.S. Attorney, recommended Alito's judicial nomination to President George H. W. Bush.[19] On February 20, 1990, Bush nominated Alito to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, to a seat vacated by John Joseph Gibbons. The American Bar Association rated Alito \"Well Qualified\" at the time of his nomination. He was confirmed by unanimous consent in the Senate on April 27, 1990,[33][34] and received his commission three days later. As a Third Circuit judge, his chambers were in Newark, New Jersey.[15]\n\n\n\n### Notable opinions[edit]\n\n\nAbortion\n* On a Third Circuit panel, the majority in *Planned Parenthood v. Casey* overturned one part of a law regulating abortion, the provision mandating that married women first inform their husbands if they sought an abortion. Alito, the third judge on the panel, disagreed, arguing that he would have upheld the spousal notification requirement along with the rest of the law.\n\n\nFederalism\n* A dissenting opinion in *United States v. Rybar*, 103 F.3d 273 (3d Cir. 1996), arguing that a U.S. law banning private citizens from owning submachine guns was similar to one struck down by the Supreme Court in *United States v. Lopez* and thus outside the authority of Congress under the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution.\n* A majority opinion in *Chittister v. Department of Community & Economic Development*, 226 F.3d 223 (3d Cir. 2000). This case concerned an employee's claim of wrongful termination under the Family and Medical Leave Act against the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. States are free to maintain sovereign immunity under the U.S. Constitution. Since Pennsylvania had maintained its immunity to such suits, Alito affirmed the lower court's dismissal of the employee's claims.\n\n\nFirst Amendment\n* A majority opinion in *Saxe v. State College Area School District*, 240 F.3d 200 (3d Cir. 2001), holding that a public school district's anti-harassment policy was unconstitutionally overbroad and therefore violated First Amendment guarantees of free speech.\n* A majority opinion in *ACLU v. Schundler*, 168 F.3d 92 (3d Cir. 1999), holding that a government-sponsored holiday display consisting solely of religious symbols was impermissible, but that a mixed display including both secular and religious symbols was permissible if balanced in a generally secular context.\n* A dissenting opinion in *C. H. v. Oliva* (3d Cir. 2000), arguing that the removal and subsequent replacement in \"a less conspicuous spot\" of a kindergartener's religious themed poster was, at least potentially, a violation of his right to free expression.\n\n\nFourth and Eighth Amendments\n* A dissenting opinion in *Doe v. Groody*, arguing that qualified immunity should have protected police officers from a finding of having violated constitutional rights when they strip-searched a mother and her ten-year-old daughter while carrying out a search warrant that authorized the search of a residence.\n* A unanimous opinion in *Chadwick v. Janecka* (3d Cir. 2002), holding that there was \"no federal constitutional bar\" to the \"indefinite confinement\" of a man imprisoned for civil contempt because he would not pay his $2.5 million debt to his wife.\n\n\nCivil rights\n* A majority opinion in *Williams v. Price*, 343 F.3d 223 (3d Cir. 2003), granting a writ of habeas corpus to a black state prisoner after state courts had refused to consider the testimony of a witness who stated that a juror had uttered derogatory remarks about blacks during an encounter in the courthouse after the conclusion of the trial.[35]\n* A dissenting opinion in *Glass v. Philadelphia Electric Company*, 34 F.3d 188 (3rd Cir. 1994), arguing that a lower court did not abuse its discretion in excluding certain evidence of past conduct that defendant had created a hostile and racist work environment.\n* A majority opinion in *Robinson v. City of Pittsburgh*, 120 F.3d 1286 (3rd Cir. 1997), rejecting a female police officer's Equal Protection-based sexual harassment and retaliation claims against the city and certain police officials and rejecting her Title VII-based retaliation claim against the city, but allowing her Title VII-based sexual harassment claim against the city.\n\n\n## U.S. Supreme Court[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Bush looking on, Alito acknowledges his nomination.\nOn July 1, 2005, Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor announced her retirement from the Supreme Court effective upon the confirmation of a successor. President George W. Bush first nominated John Roberts to the vacancy, but when Chief Justice William Rehnquist died on September 3, Bush withdrew Roberts's nomination to fill O'Connor's seat and instead nominated Roberts to the Chief Justiceship. On October 3, Bush nominated Harriet Miers to replace O'Connor. Miers withdrew her acceptance of the nomination on October 27 after encountering widespread opposition.\n\n\nOn October 31, Bush announced that he was nominating Alito to O'Connor's seat, and he submitted the nomination to the Senate on November 10.[36] Alito was unanimously rated \"well qualified\" to fill the Associate Justice post by the American Bar Association's Standing Committee on Federal Judiciary, which measures the professional qualifications of a nominee.[37] The committee rates judges as \"not qualified\", \"qualified\", or \"well qualified\".[38] Leonard Leo was selected to play a role in shepherding Alito's appointment through the Senate.[39]\n\n\nAlito's confirmation hearing was held from January 9 to 13, 2006. Two active-duty members of the Third Circuit, Judge Maryanne Trump Barry and Chief Judge Anthony J. Scirica, testified in Alito's confirmation hearing, as did five senior and retired circuit judges.[40] Alito responded to some 700 questions over 18 hours of testimony. He rejected the use of foreign legal materials in the Constitution, did not state a position on cameras in courtrooms (he had supported them while on the 3rd Circuit), said Congress could choose to outlaw LGBT employment discrimination in the United States if it wished, and told then-Senator Joe Biden (D-DE) that he endorsed a weak version of the unitary executive theory.[41]\n\n\nOn January 24, his nomination was voted out of the Senate Judiciary Committee on a 10–8 party line vote. Democratic Senators characterized Alito as a hard-right conservative in the mold of Clarence Thomas or Robert Bork. Alito professed reluctance to commit to any type of ideology, stating he would act as an impartial referee. He said he would look at abortion with an open mind but would not state how he would rule on *Roe v. Wade* if that decision were to be challenged. \n\n\nDemocrats on the committee asked Alito about his past association with the conservative group Concerned Alumni of Princeton.[42] Alito said that he had listed an affiliation with the group on his application to Ronald Reagan's Justice Department in order to establish his conservative credentials: \"You have to look at the question that I was responding to and the form that I was filling out... I was applying for a position in the Reagan administration. And my answers were truthful statements, but what I was trying to outline were the things that were relevant to obtaining a political position.\"[43] But during the confirmation hearings, he disavowed the group, whose views were criticized as racist and sexist, saying: \"I disavow them. I deplore them. They represent things that I have always stood against and I can't express too strongly.\"[43]\n\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) formally opposed Alito's nomination to the Supreme Court. The ACLU has only taken this step three other times in its entire history, opposing the nominations of William Rehnquist, Robert Bork and Brett Kavanaugh.[44][*better source needed*] In releasing its report[45][*better source needed*] on Alito, ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero said, \"At a time when our president has claimed unprecedented authority to spy on Americans and jail terrorism suspects indefinitely, America needs a Supreme Court justice who will uphold our precious civil liberties. Alito's record shows a willingness to support government actions that abridge individual freedoms.\"[46][*better source needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Alito ceremonially sworn in by Chief Justice John Roberts the day after his confirmation, February 1, 2006.\nDebate on the nomination began in the full Senate on January 25. After a failed filibuster attempt by Senator John Kerry, the Senate confirmed Alito to the Supreme Court on January 31 by a vote of 58–42.[47] All Senate Republicans voted in favor of confirmation except Lincoln Chafee, and all Senate Democrats voted against confirmation except Tim Johnson, Robert Byrd, Kent Conrad, and Ben Nelson. An Independent, Jim Jeffords, voted against confirmation.[48][49] Alito was sworn in as an associate justice of the Supreme Court later that day.[50][51] He became the 110th justice, the second Italian-American,[52][53] the 11th Catholic in the history of the Supreme Court, and the fifth Catholic on the Court at the time he assumed office.[54]\n\n\nBecause Alito joined the Court mid-term, he did not participate in the decisions of most of the early cases in the Court term because he had not heard arguments for them. These decisions were released with an 8-member Court; none were 4–4, so Alito would not have been the deciding vote in any of them if he had participated. Only three of these cases  – *Garcetti v. Ceballos*, *Hudson v. Michigan*, and *Kansas v. Marsh*  – were reargued since a tie needed to be broken.\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nAlito delivered his first written Supreme Court opinion on May 1, 2006, in *Holmes v. South Carolina*, a case involving the right of criminal defendants to present evidence that a third party committed the crime. From the beginning of the Rehnquist Court to the nomination of Justice Elena Kagan, each new justice has been given a unanimous opinion to write as their first Supreme Court opinion; this practice is designed to help \"break in\" new justices so that each justice has at least one unanimous, uncontroversial opinion under their belt.[*original research?*] Alito wrote for a unanimous court in ordering a new trial for Bobby Lee Holmes due to South Carolina's rule that barred such evidence based on the strength of the prosecution's case, rather than on the relevance and strength of the defense evidence itself. His other majority opinions in his first term were in *Zedner v. United States*, *Woodford v. Ngo*, and *Arlington Central School District Board of Education v. Murphy*.\n\n\nIn his first term, Alito compiled a fairly conservative record.[*original research?*] For example, in the three reargued cases (*Garcetti v. Ceballos*, *Hudson v. Michigan* and *Kansas v. Marsh*), Alito created a 5–4 majority by voting with the four other conservative Justices – Chief Justice John G. Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, and Clarence Thomas. He further voted with the conservative wing of the court on *Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon*[55] and *Rapanos v. United States*. Alito also dissented in *Hamdan v. Rumsfeld* alongside Justices Scalia and Thomas.\n\n\nAlito delivered the Supreme Court Historical Society's 2008 Annual Lecture, \"The Origin of the Baseball Antitrust Exemption\". The lecture was published in two journals.[56][57]\n\n\nIn 2013, Alito was considered[*by whom?*] \"one of the most conservative justices on the Court\".[58][59][60] While his voting record is conservative, he does not always join the opinions of the Court's other conservative justices.[*original research?*] On February 1, 2006, in Alito's first decision on the Supreme Court, he voted with the majority (6–3) to refuse Missouri's request to vacate the stay of execution issued by the Eighth Circuit for death-row inmate Michael Taylor. Justices Roberts, Scalia and Thomas were in favor of vacating the stay; Missouri had twice asked the justices to lift the stay and permit the execution.[61] Moreover, despite having been at one time nicknamed \"Scalito\", Alito's views have differed from those of Scalia (and Thomas), as in the Michael Taylor case and various other cases of the 2005 term.[*original research?*] A fierce critic of reliance on legislative history in statutory interpretation,[*citation needed*] Scalia was the only member of the Court in *Zedner v. United States* not to join a section of Alito's opinion that discussed the legislative history of the statute in question. In two higher-profile cases, one involving the constitutionality of political gerrymandering and one involving campaign finance reform (*LULAC v. Perry* and *Randall v. Sorrell*), Alito adopted narrow positions, declining to join the bolder positions advanced by either philosophical side of the Court.[*original research?*] According to a SCOTUSblog analysis of 2005 term decisions, Alito and Scalia concurred in the result of 86% of decisions in which both participated, and concurred in full in 75%.[62] Alito also differed from Scalia in applying originalism flexibly to arrive at conservative outcomes \"with plodding consistency\", rather than following it so strictly as to occasionally produce outcomes unfavorable to conservatives.[63]\n\n\n\n![](image)Alito swearing in Mark Esper as the United States Secretary of Defense in 2019.\nAlito's majority opinion in the 2008 worker protection case *Gomez-Perez v. Potter* cleared the way for federal workers who experience retaliation after filing age discrimination complaints to sue for damages. He sided with the liberal bloc of the court,[*original research?*] inferring protection against retaliation in the federal-sector provision of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act despite the lack of an explicit provision concerning retaliation.\n\n\nAlito joined Thomas in writing a separate dissent in *Obergefell v. Hodges*.[64][65][66] In 2020, Alito wrote a dissent joined by Thomas to *Bostock v. Clayton County*, arguing that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not prohibit discrimination by sexual orientation or gender identity and criticizing the majority's interpretation of Title VII.[67][68] In October 2020, Alito agreed with the other justices on the denial of an appeal filed by Kim Davis, a county clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.\n\n\nOn November 12, 2020, Alito made headlines for comments about the COVID-19 pandemic. Speaking to the Federalist Society, Alito criticized what he called the \"loss of individual liberties\", saying, \"We have never before seen restrictions as severe, extensive and prolonged as those experienced for most of 2020\" and calling the pandemic \"a Constitutional stress test\".[69]\n\n\nAlito has called himself a \"practical originalist\"[70] and is a member of the Court's conservative bloc.[71] He has been described as one of the Court's \"most conservative justices\".[59][58][72][73]\n\n\nAccording to *The New Yorker*, since the 2020 appointment of Justice Amy Coney Barrett, Alito has become \"the embodiment of a conservative majority that is ambitious and extreme\", overruling progressive precedents from the 1960s and '70s that were previously out of conservatives' reach.[63]\n\n\n\n#### Abortion jurisprudence[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Samuel Alito, 2018\nIn 2003, Congress passed the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, which led to a lawsuit in the case of *Gonzales v. Carhart*. The Court had previously ruled in *Stenberg v. Carhart* that a state's ban on partial birth abortion was unconstitutional because such a ban did not have an exception in the case of a threat to the health of the mother. The membership of the Court changed after *Stenberg*, with Roberts and Alito replacing Rehnquist (a dissenter in *Roe*) and O'Connor (a supporter of *Roe*) respectively. Further, the ban at issue in *Gonzales v. Carhart* was a federal statute, rather than a state statute as in the *Stenberg* case.\n\n\nOn April 18, 2007, the Supreme Court handed down a decision ruling the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act constitutional. Kennedy wrote for the five-justice majority that Congress was within its power to generally ban the procedure, although the Court left open the door for as-applied challenges. Kennedy said that the challenged statute was consistent with the Court's prior decisions in *Roe v. Wade*, *Planned Parenthood v. Casey*, and *Stenberg v. Carhart*.\n\n\nAlito joined fully in the majority, as did Roberts. Thomas filed a concurring opinion, joined by Scalia, contending that the Court's prior decisions in *Roe v. Wade* and *Planned Parenthood v. Casey* should be reversed, and also noting that the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act may exceed the powers of Congress under the Commerce Clause. Alito, Roberts, and Kennedy did not join that assertion. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, David Souter, Stephen Breyer, and John Paul Stevens dissented, contending that the ruling ignored Supreme Court abortion precedent.\n\n\nOn May 2, 2022, *Politico* published a leak of a first draft of a majority opinion by Alito that circulated among the justices in February 2022 for the upcoming decision in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization*. The opinion would overturn *Roe v. Wade* and *Planned Parenthood v. Casey*, and would likely either severely restrict access to abortion or make it completely illegal in states with trigger laws.[74] On June 24, 2022, the ruling was handed down. It was mostly identical to the leaked draft, with the addition of replies to the dissenting and concurring opinions. Alito wrote that \"*Roe* was egregiously wrong from the start.\"[75] In July 2022, Alito gave his first public comments on the ruling in a keynote address for Notre Dame Law School's Religious Liberty Initiative in Rome. He mocked several foreign leaders for criticizing the decision, particularly U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, referencing his pending resignation, and Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, who had compared the ruling to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[76][77] During an October 2022 talk at The Heritage Foundation, Alito said that the leaked opinion made some justices \"targets for assassination\", referring to the assassination attempt on fellow Justice Brett Kavanaugh during that year.[78] At the same event, he said that \"questioning [the Court's] integrity crosses an important line\", which many media commentators interpreted as criticism of Kagan's recent statements on the court's overturning of precedent during the past term.[79]\n\n\nIn November 2022, as the investigation into who had leaked the draft opinion was still ongoing, it was revealed that Rob Schenck, an evangelical minister and former anti-abortion activist, had written Roberts a letter about an alleged previous leak of a Supreme Court decision. He wrote that he had been informed of the outcome of *Burwell v. Hobby Lobby* weeks before the June 2014 decision, authored by Alito and favorable to anti-abortion conservatives, was officially announced.[80] Schenck claimed to have heard of the outcome from Gayle Wright, a conservative donor, shortly after she and her husband had lunch with Alito and his wife on June 3, 2014.[80] *The New York Times* claims contemporaneous emails written by Schenck \"strongly suggested he knew the outcome and the author of the Hobby Lobby decision before it was made public.\"[80] In a statement, Alito denied having revealed the outcome or authorship of any decision before its official announcement, but did not dispute that the June 3 lunch with Wright had occurred.[80]\n\n\nOn April 21, 2023, Alito dissented when the Supreme Court reversed a ruling by Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk that would have banned mifepristone (one of two medications used in the emergency contraception medication Plan B) nationwide.[81][82][83]\n\n\n\n#### Free speech jurisprudence[edit]\n\n\nSamuel Alito attending the inauguration of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt.\nAlito has also dissented from the opinions of the Court's conservative justices on free speech cases, one of which, *Snyder v. Phelps*, had to do with Westboro Baptist Church members' right to protest a military funeral.[84] Alito offered the sole dissenting opinion, saying protesters \"were sued under a very well-established tort that goes back to the 19th century, the intentional infliction of emotional, of severe emotional distress. And I thought that this tort constituted a reasonable exception to the First Amendment, but my colleagues disagreed about that.\"[85]\n\n\nIn the 2007 landmark free speech case *Morse v. Frederick*, Alito joined Roberts's majority decision that speech advocating drug use can be banned in public schools, but also warned that the ruling must be circumscribed so as not to interfere with political speech, such as discussion of the medical marijuana debate.\n\n\n\n#### Ethical questions[edit]\n\n\nOn June 20, 2023, Alito published an op-ed in *The Wall Street Journal* challenging the assertions made in a forthcoming *ProPublica* article, claiming that the source \"misleads its readers\".[86][87] The *ProPublica* investigation, published a few hours later, addressed Alito's relationship with billionaire businessman Paul Singer, focusing on a trip Alito and Singer took to a luxury fishing resort in Alaska and suggesting Alito \"violated a federal law that requires justices to disclose most gifts\", such as private jet travel.[88] The article said he should have recused himself in cases involving Singer and that he was obligated to disclose certain benefits as gifts on his 2008 Financial Disclosure Report. Legal ethics experts quoted in *ProPublica* called Alito's behavior \"unacceptable\".[89] Alito's preemptory challenge maintained that *ProPublica*'s charges were invalid.[88] Alito further contended that because of an exemption in the Court's reporting rules for \"personal hospitality\", he was not required to disclose private air transport for social trips.[86] His unconventional decision to bypass reporters' questions and preempt the story via a separate publication took *ProPublica*'s reporters by surprise.[90] The decision to publish the op-ed was criticized both within the *Wall Street Journal* and by media critics, in part because Alito's \"pre-buttal\" lacked fact-checking.[90][91]\n\n\nThe *ProPublica* report on unreported gifts to both Alito and Thomas led several Democratic members of Congress to call for ethics reform for the Supreme Court. This included a Senate Judiciary Committee proposal to establish a code of ethics for the Court.[92] In a July 2023 *Wall Street Journal* opinion column, Alito wrote, \"Congress did not create the Supreme Court [...] I know this is a controversial view, but I'm willing to say it. No provision in the Constitution gives them the authority to regulate the Supreme Court—period.\"[93] This declaration led to further debate among Democratic lawmakers. Senator Chris Murphy asserted that the Constitution gives Congress power to oversee the Court: \"It is just wrong on the facts to say that Congress doesn't have anything to do with the rules guiding the Supreme Court. In fact, from the very beginning, Congress has set those rules.\"[94]\n\n\n\n## Teaching[edit]\n\n\nAs an adjunct professor at Seton Hall University School of Law in Newark from 1999 to 2004, Alito taught courses in constitutional law and an original course on terrorism and civil liberties. In 1995, he received the school's Saint Thomas More Medal \"in recognition of his outstanding contributions to the field of law\".[95] On May 25, 2007, he delivered the commencement address at Seton Hall Law's commencement ceremony and received an honorary law degree from the school.[96]\n\n\nAs a visiting professor at Duke University School of Law, Alito taught Current Issues in Constitutional Interpretation in fall 2011 and a course in the Master of Laws in Judicial Studies program in summer 2012.[97][*better source needed*]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn 1985, Alito married Martha-Ann Alito, a onetime law librarian who met him during his many trips to the library as a law clerk.[15] They have two adult children together. Alito resided with his family in West Caldwell, New Jersey, before his Supreme Court nomination.[98] He has since moved to Alexandria, Virginia.[99]\n\n\nSince Stephen Breyer's retirement in 2022, Alito has been the only military veteran on the Court.[100]\n\n\nIn 2013, as part of the ongoing fallout from the Edward Snowden case, former National Security Agency analyst Russell Tice revealed that during 2002 and 2003 the National Security Agency targeted Alito's phones, and those of his staff and his family, for surveillance.[101][102]\n\n\nAlito is an avid baseball fan and a longtime fan of the Philadelphia Phillies.[103] The Phillie Phanatic was a special guest at his Supreme Court welcome dinner.[104]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Draft numbers were determined in a lottery based on birthdates; a low draft number increased the likelihood of being selected for compulsory military service overseas during the Vietnam War. The highest number called during the war was 215.[13]\n\n## Bibliography[edit]\n\n\n* *Foreword*, 1 SETON HALL CIR.

However, there is a wide divergence among Catholics in general in their approaches to the law.[3] Due to her upbringing and her past jobs and positions, Sotomayor has brought one of the more diverse sets of life experiences to the Court.[227]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n116. **^** Biskupic, Joan (July 19, 2005). \"The next president could tip high court\". *USA Today*.

California* (holding that a child's age \"would have affected how a reasonable person\" would \"perceive his or her freedom to leave\") and *Yarborough v. Alvarado* (holding that a child's age \"generates commonsense conclusions about behavior and perception\"). Sotomayor also pointed out that the law recognizes that a child's judgment is not the same as an adult's, in the form of legal disqualifications on children as a class (*e.g.*, limitations on a child's ability to marry without parental consent).

Sotomayor became the first Hispanic and fourth woman to administer the oath to a president or vice president.[228] On January 20, 2021, Sotomayor administered the oath of office to Kamala Harris for her inauguration as vice president, the first woman to ever hold the office.[229]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2020, Justice Sotomayor was reportedly targeted by the same gunman, an angry lawyer, who entered U.S. District Court Judge Esther Salas's home, shooting her husband and killing her son. The gunman had subsequently killed himself, after which his detailed planning notes regarding Sotomayor were found.[271]\n\n\nIn January 2021, Sonia Sotomayor swore in Kamala Harris as the Vice President of the United States. It was considered historic as Sotomayor is the first woman of color to serve on the Supreme Court and Harris is the first woman, African-American, and Asian-American Vice President.[272]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n73. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** Sloan, Karen (May 27, 2009). \"Nominee's civil practice was with a small, but specialized, firm\". *The National Law Journal*.

Her nomination was confirmed by the Senate in August 2009 by a vote of 68–31. While on the Court, Sotomayor has supported the informal liberal bloc of justices when they divide along the commonly perceived ideological lines. During her Supreme Court tenure, Sotomayor has been identified with concern for the rights of defendants and criminal justice reform, and is known for her impassioned dissents on issues of race, ethnic, and gender identity, including in *Schuette v. BAMN*, *Utah v. Strieff*, and *Trump v. Hawaii*.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nSotomayor[5] was born in the New York City borough of the Bronx.[6] Her father was Juan Sotomayor (c. 1921–1964),[7] from the area of Santurce, San Juan, Puerto Rico,[8][9][10] and her mother was Celina Báez (1927–2021),[11] an orphan[12] from Santa Rosa in Lajas, a rural area on Puerto Rico's southwest coast.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n​\n ​\n(m. 1976; div. 1983)​\n |\n| Education | * Princeton University (BA)\n* Yale University (JD)\n |\n| Signature | ![Cursive signature in ink](image) |\n| Sonia Sotomayor's voice\n\n\nSonia Sotomayor's opening statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee on her nomination to the Supreme CourtRecorded July 13, 2009\n |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n11. **^** Cave, Damien (May 29, 2009). \"In Puerto Rico, Supreme Court Pick With Island Roots Becomes a Superstar\". *The New York Times*.

Hobby Lobby*, in which the conservative bloc had prevailed, was opposed by the court's three female members: Sotomayor, Ginsburg and Kagan. Writing in dissent, Sotomayor wrote that the case was at odds with the majority's previous statements in *Hobby Lobby* and said, \"Those who are bound by our decisions usually believe they can take us at our word ... Not today.\" Sotomayor stated further her opinion that the decision risked depriving \"hundreds of Wheaton's employees and students of their legal entitlement to contraceptive coverage.\"[243]\n\n\n\n#### Immigration[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nwriting that \"she's not nearly as smart as she seems to think she is,\" and that \"her reputation for being something of a bully could well make her liberal impulses backfire and simply add to the fire power of the Roberts/Alito/Scalia/Thomas wing of the court.\"[171][172][173]\n\n\nOn May 25, Obama informed Sotomayor of his choice; she later said, \"I had my [hand] over my chest, trying to calm my beating heart, literally.\"[174] On May 26, 2009, Obama nominated her.[175] She became only the second jurist to be nominated to three different judicial positions by three different presidents.[176] The selection appeared to closely match Obama's presidential campaign promise that he would nominate judges who had \"the heart, the empathy, to recognize what it's like to be a teenage mom. The empathy to understand what it's like to be poor, or African-American, or gay, or disabled, or old.\"[177]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Sotomayor with her nephews at the original Yankee Stadium in 2007\nSotomayor was an adjunct professor at New York University School of Law from 1998 to 2007.[254] There she taught trial and appellate advocacy as well as a federal appellate court seminar.[254] Beginning in 1999, she was also a lecturer in law at Columbia Law School in a paying, adjunct faculty position.[84][255] While there she created and co-taught a class called the Federal Appellate Externship each semester from 2000 until her departure; it combined classroom, moot court, and Second Circuit chambers work.[255] She became a member of the Board of Trustees of Princeton University in 2006, concluding her term in 2011.[47][256] In 2008, Sotomayor became a member of the Belizean Grove, an invitation-only women's group modeled after the men's Bohemian Grove.[257] On June 19, 2009, Sotomayor resigned from the Belizean Grove after Republican politicians voiced concerns over the group's membership policy.[258]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n39. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Smith, Ben (May 29, 2009). \"Princeton University holds the key to understanding Sonia Sotomayor\". *The Politico*.

By a 5–4 vote, the Supreme Court allowed the Texas law to stay in effect. Sotomayor concluded that \"Today's fractured Court evinces no such courage. While the Court properly holds that this suit may proceed against the licensing officials, it errs gravely in foreclosing relief against state-court officials and the state attorney general.

Bush as an acceptable nominee to fill the seat of retiring Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.[135]\n\n\n\n### Notable rulings[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn succeeding Justice Souter, Sotomayor did not change the Court's net philosophical and ideological balance.[217][218][220] While many cases are decided unanimously or with different voting coalitions, Sotomayor has continued to be a reliable member of the liberal bloc of the court when the justices divide along the commonly perceived ideological lines.[222] Specifically, her voting pattern and judicial philosophy has been in close agreement with that of Justices Breyer, Ginsburg and Kagan.[223] During her first couple of years there, Sotomayor voted with Ginsburg and Breyer 90 percent of the time, one of the highest agreement rates on the Court.[217][224] In a 2015 article titled \"Ranking the Most Liberal Modern Supreme Court Justices\", Alex Greer identified Sotomayor as representing a more liberal voting pattern than both Elena Kagan and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.[225] Greer placed Sotomayor as having the most liberal voting history of all the current sitting Justices, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n143. **^** Collins, Steve (May 28, 2009). \"Sotomayor had key role in Doninger case\". *New Britain Herald*.

California* (holding that a child's age \"would have affected how a reasonable person\" would \"perceive his or her freedom to leave\") and *Yarborough v. Alvarado* (holding that a child's age \"generates commonsense conclusions about behavior and perception\"). Sotomayor also pointed out that the law recognizes that a child's judgment is not the same as an adult's, in the form of legal disqualifications on children as a class (*e.g.*, limitations on a child's ability to marry without parental consent). Associate Justice Samuel Alito, jointed by three other justices, wrote a dissenting opinion.\n\n\n\n#### Stolen Valor Act[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThere have been some deviations from the ideological pattern. In a 2013 book on the Roberts Court, author Marcia Coyle assessed Sotomayor's position on the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment as a strong guarantee of the right of a defendant to confront his or her accusers.[223] Sotomayor's judicial philosophy on the issue is seen as being in parity with Elena Kagan and, unexpectedly for Sotomayor, also in at least partial agreement with the originalist reading of Antonin Scalia when applied to the clause.\n\n\nOn January 20 and 21, 2013, Sotomayor administered the oath to Vice President Joe Biden for the inauguration of his second term. Sotomayor became the first Hispanic and fourth woman to administer the oath to a president or vice president.[228] On January 20, 2021, Sotomayor administered the oath of office to Kamala Harris for her inauguration as vice president, the first woman to ever hold the office.[229]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2020, Justice Sotomayor was reportedly targeted by the same gunman, an angry lawyer, who entered U.S. District Court Judge Esther Salas's home, shooting her husband and killing her son. The gunman had subsequently killed himself, after which his detailed planning notes regarding Sotomayor were found.[271]\n\n\nIn January 2021, Sonia Sotomayor swore in Kamala Harris as the Vice President of the United States. It was considered historic as Sotomayor is the first woman of color to serve on the Supreme Court and Harris is the first woman, African-American, and Asian-American Vice President.[272]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n73. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** Sloan, Karen (May 27, 2009). \"Nominee's civil practice was with a small, but specialized, firm\". *The National Law Journal*.

Her nomination was confirmed by the Senate in August 2009 by a vote of 68–31. While on the Court, Sotomayor has supported the informal liberal bloc of justices when they divide along the commonly perceived ideological lines. During her Supreme Court tenure, Sotomayor has been identified with concern for the rights of defendants and criminal justice reform, and is known for her impassioned dissents on issues of race, ethnic, and gender identity, including in *Schuette v. BAMN*, *Utah v. Strieff*, and *Trump v. Hawaii*.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nSotomayor[5] was born in the New York City borough of the Bronx.[6] Her father was Juan Sotomayor (c. 1921–1964),[7] from the area of Santurce, San Juan, Puerto Rico,[8][9][10] and her mother was Celina Báez (1927–2021),[11] an orphan[12] from Santa Rosa in Lajas, a rural area on Puerto Rico's southwest coast.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n​\n ​\n(m. 1976; div. 1983)​\n |\n| Education | * Princeton University (BA)\n* Yale University (JD)\n |\n| Signature | ![Cursive signature in ink](image) |\n| Sonia Sotomayor's voice\n\n\nSonia Sotomayor's opening statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee on her nomination to the Supreme CourtRecorded July 13, 2009\n |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n11. **^** Cave, Damien (May 29, 2009). \"In Puerto Rico, Supreme Court Pick With Island Roots Becomes a Superstar\". *The New York Times*.

Hobby Lobby*, in which the conservative bloc had prevailed, was opposed by the court's three female members: Sotomayor, Ginsburg and Kagan. Writing in dissent, Sotomayor wrote that the case was at odds with the majority's previous statements in *Hobby Lobby* and said, \"Those who are bound by our decisions usually believe they can take us at our word ...

In her reading of the constitutionality of the Obama health care law favoring the poor and disabled, she sided with Ginsburg against fellow liberals Breyer and Kagan.[231] In dealing with the Chief Justice, Sotomayor had no difficulty in responding to his statement that \"the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race,\" by stating, \"I don't borrow Chief Justice Roberts's description of what color-blindness is...

Every Democrat voted in her favor, as did one Republican, Lindsey Graham.[200][201] On August 6, 2009, Sotomayor was confirmed by the full Senate by a vote of 68–31.

As the five other conservative justices could outvote the rest, he supposedly could no longer preside over a moderately conservative course while respecting precedent.[82][83] This view was espoused again after the 2022 *Dobbs* decision, which overturned rulings from 1973 and 1992.[84][85]\n\n\n\n### Early decisions[edit]\n\n\nOn January 17, 2006, Roberts dissented along with Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas in *Gonzales v. Oregon*, which held that the Controlled Substances Act does not allow the United States attorney general to prohibit physicians from prescribing drugs for the assisted suicide of the terminally ill as permitted by an Oregon law. The point of contention in the case was largely one of statutory interpretation, not federalism.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nChief Justice of the United States since 2005\n\nFor other people named John Roberts, see John Roberts (disambiguation).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Preliminary Inventory\" (PDF). *reaganlibrary.gov*.

Bush appointed him to the District of Columbia Circuit. During his two-year tenure on the D.C. Circuit, Roberts authored 49 opinions, eliciting two dissents from other judges, and authoring three dissents of his own.[13] In 2005, Bush nominated Roberts to the Supreme Court, initially to be an associate justice to fill the vacancy left by the retirement of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. Chief Justice William Rehnquist died shortly afterward, however, before Roberts's Senate confirmation hearings had begun. Bush then withdrew Roberts's nomination and instead nominated him to become Chief Justice, choosing Samuel Alito to replace O'Connor.\n\n\nRoberts has authored the majority opinion in many important cases, including decisions relating to elections, federal agencies, presidential power, the Affordable Care Act, and race-based college admissions.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)President George W. Bush announces Roberts's nomination to be Chief Justice (2005).\nOn July 19, 2005, President Bush nominated Roberts to the U.S. Supreme Court to fill a vacancy to be created by the impending retirement of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. Roberts's nomination was the first Supreme Court nomination since Stephen Breyer in 1994.\n\n\nOn September 3, 2005, while Roberts's confirmation was pending before the Senate, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist died. Two days later, Bush withdrew Roberts's nomination as O'Connor's successor and announced Roberts's new nomination as Chief Justice.[47]\n\n\n\n### Roberts's testimony on his jurisprudence[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### Confirmation[edit]\n\n\nOn September 22, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved Roberts's nomination by a vote of 13–5, with Senators Ted Kennedy, Richard Durbin, Charles Schumer, Joe Biden and Dianne Feinstein voting against. Roberts was confirmed by the full Senate on September 29 by a margin of 78–22.[58] All Republicans and the one Independent voted for Roberts; the Democrats split evenly, 22–22. Roberts was confirmed by what was, historically, a narrow margin for a Supreme Court justice.[59] However, all subsequent confirmation votes have been even more narrow.[60][61][62][63]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Supreme Court[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Roberts Court\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n13. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"John G.

Buckley, who had recently retired.[35] However, the Democratic Party had a majority in the Senate at the time and was in conflict with Bush over his judicial nominees. Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Patrick Leahy refused to give Roberts a hearing in the 107th Congress.[36] The GOP regained control of the Senate on January 7, 2003, and Bush resubmitted Roberts's nomination that day. Roberts was confirmed on May 8, 2003,[37] and received his commission on June 2, 2003.[38] During his two-year tenure on the D.C.

What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.\" His remarks were widely interpreted as a rebuke of President Trump's comments.[72][73][74] As Chief Justice, Roberts presided over the first impeachment trial of Donald Trump, which began on January 16 and ended on February 5, 2020.[75] Roberts did not, however, preside over Trump's second impeachment trial, believing that the Constitution only requires that the chief justice preside in the trial of the sitting president and not of a former president.[76]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRoberts grew up in Northwest Indiana and was educated in a series of Catholic schools.

He exhibits the restraint that flows from the careful application of established decisional rules and the practice of reasoning from the case law. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThere were also cuts to early voting, purges of voter rolls and imposition of strict voter ID laws.[136][137] A 2020 study found that jurisdictions that had previously been covered by preclearance substantially increased their voter registration purges after the *Shelby* decision.[138] Virtually all restrictions on voting subsequent to the ruling were enacted by Republicans.[139]\n\n\nIn 2023, Roberts and Brett Kavanaugh joined the liberals in Allen v. Milligan, a 5-4 decision holding that Alabama's congressional redistricting plan violated Section 2 of the VRA. Writing for the majority, Roberts concluded that Alabama must draw an additional majority-minority district, and determined that Section 2 of the Act is constitutional in the redistricting context. Writing for himself and the three liberal justices, Roberts also wrote that \"[t]he contention that mapmakers must be entirely 'blind' to race has no footing in our §2 case law.\"[140]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1989, Roberts joined the Administration of president George H. W. Bush as Principal Deputy Solicitor General.[24] He served as the acting solicitor general for the case of *Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC* when the solicitor general, Ken Starr, had a conflict of interest. In the case, Roberts argued against policies of the FCC intended to increase minority ownership of broadcast licenses, arguing that the racial preferences were unconstitutional. Roberts's decision to argue that a federal agency's policy was unconstitutional surprised many lawyers within the Solicitor General's office.[25][26][27] In 1992, Bush nominated Roberts to a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, but no Senate vote was held, and Roberts's nomination expired at the end of the 102nd Congress.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDuring his tenure as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Roberts has struck down voting rights protections provided by the Voting Rights Act.[131][132][133] In *Shelby County v. Holder* (2013), Roberts struck down requirements that states and localities with a history of racially motivated voter suppression obtain federal preclearance before implementing any changes to voting laws. Research shows that preclearance had led to increases in minority congressional representation and minority turnout.[134][135] Five years after the ruling, nearly 1,000 U.S. polling places had closed, many of them in predominantly African-American counties. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the late 1990s, while working for Hogan & Hartson, Roberts served as a member of the steering committee of the Washington, D.C., chapter of the conservative Federalist Society (although Roberts says he has never been a Federalist Society member).[33] In 2000, Roberts advised Jeb Bush, then governor of Florida, concerning Bush's actions in the Florida election recount during the presidential election.[34]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n153. **^** Sherman, Mark (September 29, 2010). \"Pfizer stock sold; Roberts to hear company's cases\". *The Washington Times*.

FEC* (2010), Roberts wrote the plurality opinion in another landmark campaign finance case called *McCutcheon v. FEC* (2014). In *McCutcheon* the Court ruled that \"aggregate limits\" on the combined amount a donor could give to various federal candidates or party committees violated the First Amendment.[66][86]\n\n\n\n### Fourth Amendment[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRoberts authored the 2007 student free speech case *Morse v. Frederick*, ruling that a student in a public school-sponsored activity does not have the right to advocate drug use on the basis that the right to free speech does not invariably prevent the exercise of school discipline.[111]\n\n\nOn April 20, 2010, in *United States v. Stevens*, the Supreme Court struck down an animal cruelty law. Roberts, writing for an 8–1 majority, found that a federal statute criminalizing the commercial production, sale, or possession of depictions of cruelty to animals was an unconstitutional abridgment of the First Amendment right to freedom of speech. The Court held that the statute was substantially overbroad; for example, it could allow prosecutions for selling photos of out-of-season hunting.[112]\n\n\n\n### Health care reform[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Case\n | Argued\n | Decided\n | Represented\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| *First Options v.

He became the head of the firm's appellate practice, and also became an adjunct professor at the Georgetown University Law Center. During this time, Roberts argued 39 cases before the Supreme Court, prevailing in 25 of them.[28] He represented 19 states in *United States v.

Roberts's involvement with the case was minimal, as he later stated that he had been involved for less than ten hours in preparing oral arguments.[29] He also argued on behalf of the homeless, in a case which became one of Roberts's \"few appellate losses.\"[*further explanation needed*][30] He also represented, pro bono, a man who was sentenced to death for killing eight people in Florida.[31][32]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nIn 2007, Roberts had a seizure at his vacation home in St. George, Maine[146][147]\nand stayed overnight at a hospital in Rockport, Maine;[148]\ndoctors found no identifiable cause.[146][147][149][150]\nRoberts had suffered a similar seizure in 1993[146][147][149]\nbut an official Supreme Court statement said that a neurological evaluation \"revealed no cause for concern.\" Federal judges are not required by law to release information about their health.[146]\n\n\nOn June 21, 2020, Roberts fell at a Maryland country club; his forehead required sutures and he stayed overnight in the hospital for observation.

Justice Holmes described assessing the constitutionality of an act of Congress as the gravest duty that the Supreme Court is called upon to perform. ... It's a principle that is easily stated and needs to be observed in practice, as well as in theory.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRoberts wrote his first dissent in *Georgia v. Randolph* (2006). The majority's decision prohibited police from searching a home if both occupants are present but one objected and the other consented. Roberts criticized the majority opinion as inconsistent with prior case law and for partly basing its reasoning on its perception of social custom. He said the social expectation test was flawed because the Fourth Amendment protects a legitimate expectation of privacy, not social expectations.[87]\n\n\nIn *Utah v. Strieff* (2016), Roberts joined the majority in ruling (5–3) that a person with an outstanding warrant may be arrested and searched, and that any evidence discovered based on that search is admissible in court; the majority opinion held that this remains true even when police act unlawfully by stopping a person without reasonable suspicion, before learning of the existence of the outstanding warrant.[88]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn June 28, 2012, Roberts delivered the majority opinion in *National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius*, which upheld the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act by a 5–4 vote. The Court indicated that although the \"individual mandate\" component of the Act could not be upheld under the Commerce Clause, the mandate could be construed as a tax and was therefore ruled to be valid under Congress's authority to \"lay and collect taxes.\"[113][114] The Court overturned a portion of the law related to the withholding of funds from states that did not comply with the expansion of Medicaid; Roberts wrote that \"Congress is not free ... to penalize states that choose not to participate in that new program by taking away their existing Medicaid funding.\"[114]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\"No one is very happy about the events that led to this litigation,\" Roberts wrote. Because age discrimination is evaluated using a rational basis test, however, only weak state interests were required to justify the policy, and the panel concluded they were present. \"Because parents and guardians play an essential role in that rehabilitative process, it is reasonable for the District to seek to ensure their participation, and the method chosen—detention until the parent is notified and retrieves the child—certainly does that, in a way issuing a citation might not.\" The court concluded that the policy and detention were constitutional, noting that \"the question before us ... is not whether these policies were a bad idea, but whether they violated the Fourth and Fifth amendments to the Constitution,\" language reminiscent of Justice Potter Stewart's dissent in *Griswold v. Connecticut*. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n133. **^** \"High Noon For The Future Of The Voting Rights Act At The Supreme Court\". *NPR.org*. Archived from the original on July 9, 2021.

The determination of when deference to legislative policy judgments goes too far and becomes abdication of the judicial responsibility, and when scrutiny of those judgments goes too far on the part of the judges and becomes what I think is properly called judicial activism, that is certainly the central dilemma of having an unelected, as you describe it correctly, undemocratic judiciary in a democratic republic.[49]\n> \n> \n\n\n#### *Stare decisis*[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Roberts, John (1978). \"Developments in the Law: Zoning – III.

As the five other conservative justices could outvote the rest, he supposedly could no longer preside over a moderately conservative course while respecting precedent.[82][83] This view was espoused again after the 2022 *Dobbs* decision, which overturned rulings from 1973 and 1992.[84][85]\n\n\n\n### Early decisions[edit]\n\n\nOn January 17, 2006, Roberts dissented along with Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas in *Gonzales v. Oregon*, which held that the Controlled Substances Act does not allow the United States attorney general to prohibit physicians from prescribing drugs for the assisted suicide of the terminally ill as permitted by an Oregon law. The point of contention in the case was largely one of statutory interpretation, not federalism.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nChief Justice of the United States since 2005\n\nFor other people named John Roberts, see John Roberts (disambiguation).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Preliminary Inventory\" (PDF). *reaganlibrary.gov*.

Bush appointed him to the District of Columbia Circuit. During his two-year tenure on the D.C. Circuit, Roberts authored 49 opinions, eliciting two dissents from other judges, and authoring three dissents of his own.[13] In 2005, Bush nominated Roberts to the Supreme Court, initially to be an associate justice to fill the vacancy left by the retirement of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. Chief Justice William Rehnquist died shortly afterward, however, before Roberts's Senate confirmation hearings had begun. Bush then withdrew Roberts's nomination and instead nominated him to become Chief Justice, choosing Samuel Alito to replace O'Connor.\n\n\nRoberts has authored the majority opinion in many important cases, including decisions relating to elections, federal agencies, presidential power, the Affordable Care Act, and race-based college admissions.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)President George W. Bush announces Roberts's nomination to be Chief Justice (2005).\nOn July 19, 2005, President Bush nominated Roberts to the U.S. Supreme Court to fill a vacancy to be created by the impending retirement of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. Roberts's nomination was the first Supreme Court nomination since Stephen Breyer in 1994.\n\n\nOn September 3, 2005, while Roberts's confirmation was pending before the Senate, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist died. Two days later, Bush withdrew Roberts's nomination as O'Connor's successor and announced Roberts's new nomination as Chief Justice.[47]\n\n\n\n### Roberts's testimony on his jurisprudence[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### Confirmation[edit]\n\n\nOn September 22, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved Roberts's nomination by a vote of 13–5, with Senators Ted Kennedy, Richard Durbin, Charles Schumer, Joe Biden and Dianne Feinstein voting against. Roberts was confirmed by the full Senate on September 29 by a margin of 78–22.[58] All Republicans and the one Independent voted for Roberts; the Democrats split evenly, 22–22. Roberts was confirmed by what was, historically, a narrow margin for a Supreme Court justice.[59] However, all subsequent confirmation votes have been even more narrow.[60][61][62][63]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Supreme Court[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Roberts Court\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n13. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"John G.

What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.\" His remarks were widely interpreted as a rebuke of President Trump's comments.[72][73][74] As Chief Justice, Roberts presided over the first impeachment trial of Donald Trump, which began on January 16 and ended on February 5, 2020.[75] Roberts did not, however, preside over Trump's second impeachment trial, believing that the Constitution only requires that the chief justice preside in the trial of the sitting president and not of a former president.[76]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRoberts grew up in Northwest Indiana and was educated in a series of Catholic schools. He studied history at Harvard University and then attended Harvard Law School, where he was managing editor of the *Harvard Law Review*. He served as a law clerk for Circuit Judge Henry Friendly and Justice William Rehnquist before taking a position in the attorney general's office during the Reagan Administration. He went on to serve the Reagan Administration and the George H. W. Bush Administration in the Department of Justice and the Office of the White House Counsel, during which he was nominated by George H. W. Bush to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, but no vote on his nomination was held.[10] Roberts then spent 14 years in private law practice.

Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for a five-justice majority, distinguished *Stenberg v. Carhart*, and concluded that the Court's previous decision in *Planned Parenthood v. Casey* did not prevent Congress from banning the procedure. The decision left the door open for future as-applied challenges, and did not address the broader question of whether Congress had the authority to pass the law.[90] Justice Clarence Thomas filed a concurring opinion, contending that the Court's prior decisions in *Roe v.

W. Bush as Principal Deputy Solicitor General.[24] He served as the acting solicitor general for the case of *Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC* when the solicitor general, Ken Starr, had a conflict of interest. In the case, Roberts argued against policies of the FCC intended to increase minority ownership of broadcast licenses, arguing that the racial preferences were unconstitutional. Roberts's decision to argue that a federal agency's policy was unconstitutional surprised many lawyers within the Solicitor General's office.[25][26][27] In 1992, Bush nominated Roberts to a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C.

Research shows that preclearance had led to increases in minority congressional representation and minority turnout.[134][135] Five years after the ruling, nearly 1,000 U.S. polling places had closed, many of them in predominantly African-American counties. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the late 1990s, while working for Hogan & Hartson, Roberts served as a member of the steering committee of the Washington, D.C., chapter of the conservative Federalist Society (although Roberts says he has never been a Federalist Society member).[33] In 2000, Roberts advised Jeb Bush, then governor of Florida, concerning Bush's actions in the Florida election recount during the presidential election.[34]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n153. **^** Sherman, Mark (September 29, 2010). \"Pfizer stock sold; Roberts to hear company's cases\". *The Washington Times*.

The majority's decision prohibited police from searching a home if both occupants are present but one objected and the other consented. Roberts criticized the majority opinion as inconsistent with prior case law and for partly basing its reasoning on its perception of social custom. He said the social expectation test was flawed because the Fourth Amendment protects a legitimate expectation of privacy, not social expectations.[87]\n\n\nIn *Utah v. Strieff* (2016), Roberts joined the majority in ruling (5–3) that a person with an outstanding warrant may be arrested and searched, and that any evidence discovered based on that search is admissible in court; the majority opinion held that this remains true even when police act unlawfully by stopping a person without reasonable suspicion, before learning of the existence of the outstanding warrant.[88]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn June 28, 2012, Roberts delivered the majority opinion in *National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius*, which upheld the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act by a 5–4 vote. The Court indicated that although the \"individual mandate\" component of the Act could not be upheld under the Commerce Clause, the mandate could be construed as a tax and was therefore ruled to be valid under Congress's authority to \"lay and collect taxes.\"[113][114] The Court overturned a portion of the law related to the withholding of funds from states that did not comply with the expansion of Medicaid; Roberts wrote that \"Congress is not free ... to penalize states that choose not to participate in that new program by taking away their existing Medicaid funding.\"[114]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\"No one is very happy about the events that led to this litigation,\" Roberts wrote. Because age discrimination is evaluated using a rational basis test, however, only weak state interests were required to justify the policy, and the panel concluded they were present. \"Because parents and guardians play an essential role in that rehabilitative process, it is reasonable for the District to seek to ensure their participation, and the method chosen—detention until the parent is notified and retrieves the child—certainly does that, in a way issuing a citation might not.\" The court concluded that the policy and detention were constitutional, noting that \"the question before us ... is not whether these policies were a bad idea, but whether they violated the Fourth and Fifth amendments to the Constitution,\" language reminiscent of Justice Potter Stewart's dissent in *Griswold v.

She was nominated by President Barack Obama on May 10, 2010, and has served since August 7, 2010. Kagan is the fourth woman to become a member of the Court.\n\n\nKagan was born and raised in New York City. After graduating from Princeton University, Worcester College, Oxford, and Harvard Law School, she clerked for a federal Court of Appeals judge and for Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall. She began her career as a professor at the University of Chicago Law School, leaving to serve as Associate White House Counsel, and later as a policy adviser under President Bill Clinton. After a nomination to the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which expired without action, she became a professor at Harvard Law School and was later named its first female dean.\n\n\nIn 2009, Kagan became the first female solicitor general of the United States.[5] The following year, President Obama nominated her to the Supreme Court to fill the vacancy arising from the impending retirement of Justice John Paul Stevens. The United States Senate confirmed her nomination by a vote of 63–37. As of 2022, she is the most recent justice appointed without any prior judicial experience. She is considered part of the Court's liberal wing, but tends to be its most moderate justice. She has written the majority opinion in some landmark cases, such as *Cooper v. Harris*, *Chiafalo v. Washington*, and *Kisor v. Wilkie*, as well as several notable dissenting opinions, such as in *Rucho v. Common Cause*, *West Virginia v. EPA*, *Brnovich v. DNC*, *Janus v. AFSCME*, and *Seila Law v. CFPB*.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nKagan was born on April 28, 1960, in Manhattan, the second of three children[6][7] of Robert Kagan, an attorney who represented tenants trying to remain in their homes, and Gloria (Gittelman) Kagan, who taught at Hunter College Elementary School.[8][9] Both her parents were the children of Russian Jewish immigrants.[9] Kagan was raised in New York City.[10] She has two brothers, Marc and Irving.[11]\n\n\nKagan and her family lived in a third-floor apartment at West End Avenue and 75th Street,[12] and attended Lincoln Square Synagogue.[13] She was independent and strong-willed in her youth and, according to a former law partner of her father's, clashed with her Orthodox rabbi, Shlomo Riskin, over aspects of her bat mitzvah.[12] \"She had strong opinions about what a bat mitzvah should be like, which didn't parallel the wishes of the rabbi,\" her father's colleague said.[14] Kagan and Riskin negotiated a solution. Riskin had never performed a ritual bat mitzvah before.[13] She \"felt very strongly that there should be ritual bat mitzvah in the synagogue, no less important than the ritual bar mitzvah. This was really the first formal bat mitzvah we had\", he said.[13] Kagan asked to read from the Torah on a Saturday morning as the boys did, but ultimately read from the Book of Ruth on a Friday night.[13] She now practices Conservative Judaism.[13]\n\n\nKagan's childhood friend Margaret Raymond recalled that she was a teenage smoker but not a partier.[12] On Saturday nights, Raymond and Kagan were \"more apt to sit on the steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and talk.\"[12] Kagan also loved literature and reread Jane Austen's *Pride and Prejudice* every year.[12] In her 1977 Hunter College High School yearbook, she is pictured in a judge's robe and holding a gavel.[15] Next to the photo is a quotation from former Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter: \"Government is itself an art, one of the subtlest of arts.\"[16]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kagan graduates from Harvard Law School in 1986\nKagan attended Hunter College High School, where her mother taught. The school had a reputation as one of the most elite learning institutions for high school girls and attracted students from all over New York City. Kagan emerged as one of the school's more outstanding students.[17] She was elected president of the student government and served on a student-faculty consultative committee.[18] Kagan then attended Princeton University, graduating in 1981 with a Bachelor of Arts, *summa cum laude*, in history.[19] She was particularly drawn to American history and archival research.[20] She wrote a senior thesis under historian Sean Wilentz titled \"To the Final Conflict: Socialism in New York City, 1900–1933\". In it she wrote, \"Through its own internal feuding, then, the SP [Socialist Party] exhausted itself forever. The story is a sad but also a chastening one for those who, more than half a century after socialism's decline, still wish to change America.\"[21] Wilentz says Kagan did not mean to defend socialism, noting that she \"was interested in it. To study something is not to endorse it.\"[12]\n\n\nAs an undergraduate, Kagan also served as editorial chair of *The Daily Princetonian*.[19][22] Along with eight other students,[a] she penned a \"Declaration of the Campaign for a Democratic University\". It called for \"a fundamental restructuring of university governance\" and condemned Princeton's administration for making decisions \"behind closed doors\".[23] Despite the liberal tone of *The Daily Princetonian*'s editorials, Kagan was politically restrained in her dealings with fellow reporters. Her *Daily Princetonian* colleague Steven Bernstein has said he \"cannot recall a time in which Kagan expressed her political views\".[24] He described Kagan's political stances as \"sort of liberal, democratic, progressive tradition, and everything with lower case\".[24]\n\n\nIn 1980, Kagan received Princeton's Daniel M. Sachs Class of 1960 Graduating Scholarship,[b] one of the highest general awards the university confers. This enabled her to study at Worcester College, Oxford. As part of her graduation requirement, Kagan wrote a thesis called \"The Development and Erosion of the American Exclusionary Rule: A Study in Judicial Method\". It presented a critical look at the exclusionary rule and its evolution on the Supreme Court—the Warren Court, in particular.[26] She earned a Master of Philosophy in politics at Oxford in 1983.[27]\n\n\nIn 1983, at age 23, Kagan entered Harvard Law School. Her adjustment to Harvard's atmosphere was rocky; she received the worst grades of her entire law school career in her first semester. Kagan went on to earn an A in 17 of the 21 courses she took at Harvard, and she became a supervisory editor of the *Harvard Law Review*.[28] She worked as a summer associate at the Wall Street law firm Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson, where she worked in the litigation department.[29] She graduated in 1986 with a Juris Doctor *magna cum laude*.[30][31] Her friend Jeffrey Toobin recalls that Kagan \"stood out from the start as one with a formidable mind. She's good with people. At the time, the law school was a politically charged and divided place. She navigated the factions with ease, and won the respect of everyone.\"[32]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### Early career[edit]\n\n\nAfter law school, Kagan was a law clerk for judge Abner J. Mikva of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit from 1987 to 1988. She became one of Mikva's favorite clerks; he called her \"the pick of the litter\".[33] From 1988 to 1989, Kagan clerked for justice Thurgood Marshall of the U.S. Supreme Court. Marshall said he hired Kagan to help him put the \"spark\" back into his opinions as the Court had been undergoing a conservative shift since William Rehnquist became Chief Justice in 1986.[34] Marshall nicknamed the 5-foot-3-inch (1.60-metre) Kagan \"Shorty\".[12]\n\n\nFrom 1989 to 1991, Kagan was in private practice at the Washington, D.C., law firm Williams & Connolly.[35] As a junior associate, she drafted briefs and conducted discovery.[36] During her short time at the firm, she handled five lawsuits that involved First Amendment or media law issues and libel issues.[37]\n\n\nIn 1991, Kagan became an assistant professor at the University of Chicago Law School.[38] While there she first met Barack Obama, a guest lecturer at the school.[39][40] While on the UC faculty, Kagan published a law review article on the regulation of First Amendment hate speech in the wake of the Supreme Court's ruling in *R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul*;[41] an article discussing the significance of governmental motive in regulating speech;[42] and a review of a book by Stephen L. Carter discussing the judicial confirmation process.[43] In the first article, which became highly influential, Kagan argued that the Supreme Court should examine governmental motives when deciding First Amendment cases and analyzed historic draft-card burning and flag burning cases in light of free speech arguments.[44]\n\n\nIn 1993, Senator Joe Biden appointed Kagan as a special counsel for the Senate Judiciary Committee. During this time, she worked on Ruth Bader Ginsburg's Supreme Court confirmation hearings.[45]\n\n\nKagan became a tenured professor of law in 1995.[38] According to her colleagues, Kagan's students complimented and admired her from the beginning, and she was granted tenure \"despite the reservations of some colleagues who thought she had not published enough\".[12]\n\n\n\n### Clinton administration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kagan in the Oval Office with President Bill Clinton in 1997 during her tenure as Deputy Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy\nKagan served as Associate White House Counsel for Bill Clinton from 1995 to 1996, when Mikva served as White House Counsel. She worked on such issues affecting the Clinton administration as the Whitewater controversy, the White House travel office controversy, and *Clinton v. Jones*.[46] From 1997 to 1999, she worked as Deputy Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy and deputy director of the Domestic Policy Council. Kagan worked on topics like budget appropriations, campaign finance reform, and social welfare issues. Her work is catalogued in the Clinton Library.[47] Kagan coauthored a 1997 memo urging Clinton to support a ban on late-term abortions: \"We recommend that you endorse the Daschle amendment in order to sustain your credibility on HR 1122 and prevent Congress from overriding your veto.\"[48]\n\n\nOn June 17, 1999, Clinton nominated Kagan to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, to replace James L. Buckley, who took senior status in 1996. The Senate Judiciary Committee's Republican Chairman, Orrin Hatch, scheduled no hearing, effectively ending her nomination. When the Senate term ended, her nomination lapsed, as did that of fellow Clinton nominee Allen Snyder.[49][50]\n\n\n\n### Academia[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kagan as Harvard Law School dean in 2008\n![](image)Kagan's 2009 official portrait as Harvard Law School dean\nAfter her service in the White House and her lapsed judicial nomination, Kagan returned to academia in 1999. She initially sought to return to the University of Chicago, but she had given up her tenured position during her extended stint in the Clinton Administration, and the school chose not to rehire her, reportedly due to doubts about her commitment to academia.[51] Kagan quickly found a position as a visiting professor at Harvard Law School. While there, she authored a law review article on United States administrative law, focusing on the president's role in formulating and influencing federal administrative law. The article was honored as the year's top scholarly article by the American Bar Association's Section on Administrative Law and Regulatory Practice.[52]\n\n\nIn 2001, Kagan was named a full professor at Harvard Law School and in 2003 she was named dean of the Law School by Harvard University President Lawrence Summers.[53] She succeeded Robert C. Clark, who had served as dean for over a decade. The focus of her tenure was on improving student satisfaction. Efforts included constructing new facilities and reforming the first-year curriculum as well as aesthetic changes and creature comforts, such as free morning coffee. She has been credited for a consensus-building leadership style that defused the school's previous ideological discord.[54][55][56]\n\n\nAs dean, Kagan inherited a $400 million capital campaign, \"Setting the Standard,\" in 2003. It ended in 2008 with a record-breaking $476 million raised, 19% more than the original goal.[57] Kagan made a number of prominent new hires, increasing the size of the faculty considerably. Her coups included hiring legal scholar Cass Sunstein away from the University of Chicago[58] and Lawrence Lessig away from Stanford.[59] She also made an effort to hire conservative scholars, such as former Bush administration official Jack Goldsmith, for the traditionally liberal-leaning faculty.[55][60]\n\n\nAccording to Kevin Washburn, then dean of the University of New Mexico School of Law, Kagan transformed Harvard Law School from a harsh environment for students to one that was much more student-focused.[56]\n\n\n\nDuring her deanship, Kagan upheld a decades-old policy barring military recruiters from the Office of Career Services because she felt the military's \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" policy discriminated against gays and lesbians. According to Campus Progress, \n\n\n> As dean, Kagan supported a lawsuit intended to overturn the Solomon Amendment so military recruiters might be banned from the grounds of schools like Harvard. When a federal appeals court ruled The Pentagon could not withhold funds, she banned the military from Harvard's campus once again. The case was challenged in the Supreme Court, which ruled the military could indeed require schools to allow recruiters if they wanted to receive federal money. Kagan, though she allowed the military back, simultaneously urged students to demonstrate against Don't Ask, Don't Tell.[61][62]\n> \n> \n\n\nIn October 2003, Kagan sent an email to students and faculty deploring that military recruiters had shown up on campus in violation of this policy. The email read in part, \"This action causes me deep distress. I abhor the military's discriminatory recruitment policy\".[63] She also wrote that it was \"a profound wrong—a moral injustice of the first order\".[63]\n\n\nFrom 2005 to 2008, Kagan was a member of the Research Advisory Council of the Goldman Sachs Global Markets Institute. She received a $10,000 stipend for her service.[64]\n\n\nBy early 2007, Kagan was a finalist for the presidency of Harvard University after Lawrence Summers's resignation the previous year. The position ultimately went to Drew Gilpin Faust instead. Kagan was reportedly disappointed, and law school students threw her a party to express their appreciation for her leadership.[65]\n\n\n\n### Solicitor General[edit]\n\n\nOn January 5, 2009, President-elect Barack Obama announced he would nominate Kagan to be Solicitor General.[66][67] She was vetted for the position of Deputy Attorney General before her selection as Solicitor General.[68] At the time of her nomination, Kagan had never argued a case before any court.[69] At least two previous solicitors general, Robert Bork and Kenneth Starr, had no previous Supreme Court appearances.[70]\n\n\nThe two main questions senators had for Kagan during her confirmation hearings were whether she would defend statutes that she personally opposed and whether she was qualified to be Solicitor General given her lack of courtroom experience.[71] Kagan testified that she would defend laws, such as the Defense of Marriage Act, pursuant to which states were not required to recognize same-sex marriages originating in other states, \"if there is any reasonable basis to do so\".[72] The Senate confirmed her on March 19, 2009, by a vote of 61 to 31.[73] She was the first woman to hold the position.[74] Upon taking office, Kagan pledged to defend any statute as long as there was a colorable argument to be made, regardless of her personal opinions.[71] As Solicitor General, Kagan's job was to act as the lawyer for the United States and defend legislation and executive actions in appeals before the Supreme Court.[74][45] Thus the arguments she made as Solicitor General were not necessarily indicative of her personal beliefs.[74]\n\n\nKagan's first appearance before the Supreme Court was on September 9, 2009, one month before the typical start of a new term in October, in the re-argument of *Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission*, 558 U.S. 310 (2010).[75] During argument, she asked the Court to uphold a 1990 precedent that allowed the government to restrict corporations' use of their treasuries to campaign for or against political candidates. As an alternative argument, Kagan further contended that if the Court would not uphold precedent, it should keep its ruling narrowly focused on corporations that resembled the petitioning organization, Citizens United, rather than reconsidering the constitutionality of broader restrictions on corporate campaign finance.[75][76][77] In a 5–4 decision, the Court overturned precedent and allowed corporations to spend freely in elections, a major defeat for the Obama administration.[78]\n\n\nDuring her 15 months as Solicitor General, Kagan argued six cases before the Supreme Court.[79] *The Washington Post* described her style during argument as \"confident\" and \"conversational\".[74] She helped win four cases: *Salazar v. Buono*, 559 U.S. 700 (2010), *United States v. Comstock*, 560 U.S. 126 (2010), *Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project*, 561 U.S. 1 (2010), and *Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board*, 561 U.S. 477 (2010).[80][c]\n\n\n\n### Supreme Court[edit]\n\n\n#### Nomination[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Elena Kagan Supreme Court nomination\n\n![](image)Kagan meets with then President Obama in the Oval Office, April 2010, a month before nominating her to the U.S. Supreme Court\nObama nominates Kagan to be an Associate Justice for the United States Supreme Court\nBefore Obama's election, Kagan was the subject of media speculation as a potential Supreme Court nominee if a Democratic president were elected in 2008.[82] Obama had his first Supreme Court vacancy to fill in 2009 when Associate Justice David H. Souter announced his upcoming retirement.[83] Senior Obama adviser David Axelrod later recounted that during the search for a new justice, Antonin Scalia told him he hoped Obama would nominate Kagan, because of her intelligence.[84] On May 13, 2009, the Associated Press reported that Obama was considering Kagan, among others.[85] On May 26, 2009, Obama announced that he had chosen Sonia Sotomayor.[86]\n\n\nOn April 9, 2010, Justice John Paul Stevens announced he would retire at the start of the Court's summer 2010 recess, triggering new speculation about potential replacements, and Kagan was once again considered a contender.[87] In a *Fresh Dialogues* interview, Jeffrey Toobin, a Supreme Court analyst and Kagan's friend and law school classmate,[88] speculated that she would be Obama's nominee, describing her as \"very much an Obama-type person, a moderate Democrat, a consensus builder\".[89] This alarmed some liberals and progressives, who worried that \"replacing Stevens with Kagan risks moving the Court to the right, perhaps substantially to the right\".[90]\n\n\nOn May 10, 2010, Obama nominated Kagan to the Supreme Court.[91] The deans of over one-third of the country's law schools, 69 people in total, endorsed the nomination in an open letter in early June. It lauded what it called her coalition-building skills and \"understanding of both doctrine and policy\" as well as her written record of legal analysis.[92]\n\n\n\n#### Confirmation hearings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kagan, Obama, and Chief Justice John Roberts before her investiture ceremony, October 1, 2010\n![](image)Kagan (right), then a Supreme Court nominee, meets with U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen\nKagan's confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee began on June 28.[93] As they began, Kagan was expected to be confirmed, with Senator John Cornyn calling her \"justice-to-be\".[94] During the hearings, she demonstrated a deep knowledge of Supreme Court cases, expounding upon cases senators mentioned in their questions to her without taking notes on the questions. A number of Democratic senators criticized recent decisions of the court as \"activist\", but Kagan avoided joining in their criticisms.[95] Like many prior nominees, including Chief Justice John Roberts, she declined to answer whether she thought particular cases were correctly decided or how she would vote on particular issues.[95][96] Senators Jon Kyl and Arlen Specter[d] criticized her evasiveness. Specter said it obscured the way justices actually ruled once on the Court.[96] He noted that Kagan published an article in the *University of Chicago Law Review* in 1995 in which she criticized the evasiveness she came to practice.[98][94] Republican senators criticized Kagan's background as more political than judicial; she responded by promising to be impartial and fair.[93] On July 20, 2010, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 13–6 to recommend Kagan's confirmation to the full Senate. On August 5 the full Senate confirmed her nomination by a vote of 63–37.[99] The voting was largely along party lines, with five Republicans (Richard Lugar, Judd Gregg, Lindsey Graham, Susan Collins, and Olympia Snowe) supporting her and one Democrat (Ben Nelson) opposing.[100]\n\n\nKagan's swearing-in ceremony took place on August 7, 2010, at the White House. Chief Justice John Roberts administered the prescribed constitutional and judicial oaths of office, at which time she became the 112th justice (100th associate justice) of the Supreme Court.[101][102] She is the first person appointed to the Court without any prior experience as a judge since William Rehnquist and Lewis F. Powell Jr., who both became members in 1972.[103][104][105] She is the fourth female justice in the court's history,[e] and the eighth Jewish justice.[106][f]\n\n\nIdeologically, Kagan is part of the Supreme Court's liberal wing:[108][109][110] she voted with the liberal bloc in *King v. Burwell*, 576 U.S. 988 (2015), finding that Obamacare's subsidies and individual mandate are constitutional, and in *Obergefell v. Hodges*, 576 U.S. 644 (2015), which prohibits states from outlawing same-sex marriage.[111] In 2018, *Slate* observed that Kagan had crossed ideological lines on multiple cases during the preceding term, and considered her to be part of a centrist bloc along with Justices Roberts, Stephen Breyer, and Anthony Kennedy.[112] Still, *FiveThirtyEight* observed that Kagan voted with her more liberal peers, Ginsburg and Sotomayor, over 90% of the time.[113] Also during the 2017–18 term, Kagan most commonly agreed with Breyer; they voted together in 93% of cases. She agreed least often with Justice Samuel Alito, in 58.82% of cases.[114]\n\n\nBecause of her service as solicitor general, Kagan recused herself from 28 out of the 78 cases heard during her first year on the Court to avoid conflicts of interest.[115] In 2017, she recused herself from the immigrant-detention case *Jennings v. Rodriguez* because she authorized a filing in the case when she was solicitor general.[116]\n\n\nKagan was the circuit justice, the justice responsible for handling emergency requests, for the Sixth and Seventh Circuits.[117] After Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation, she was assigned to the Ninth Circuit, the largest US circuit court by area. It includes Alaska, Arizona, California, Guam, Hawaii, Idaho, Oregon, Montana, Nevada, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Washington state.[118][117]\n\n\n\n#### Jurisprudence[edit]\n\n\nKagan's first opinion as a justice, *Ransom v. FIA Card Services*, was a statutory interpretation case where the Court was tasked with determining what income a debtor was allowed to shield from creditors in bankruptcy.[119] In an 8–1 decision, she held that the Chapter 13 Bankruptcy statute precludes a debtor from taking an allowance for car-related expenses if the debtor owns the car outright and does not make loan or lease payments. She reasoned the word \"applicable\" was key to the statute, and debtors could only take allowances for car-related costs that applied.[120][121] Kagan wrote the majority opinion in *Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC*. In the 6–3 decision in favor of Marvel, she held that a patentee cannot receive royalties after the patent has expired.[122] Her opinion included several references to Spider-Man.[123]\n\n\n\n##### First Amendment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)John Roberts, Stephen Breyer, Kagan, and Neil Gorsuch at President Donald Trump's 2018 State of the Union Address\nKagan's first dissent came in the First Amendment case *Arizona Christian School Tuition Organization v. Winn*, 563 U.S. 125 (2011).[124] Writing for the liberal wing, she took issue with the majority's creation of an exception to the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.[124] The majority held that Arizona taxpayers cannot challenge tax credits for those who donate to groups that provide scholarships to religious schools, drawing a distinction between the way the Court treats tax credits and grants.[124][125] Kagan deemed this distinction \"arbitrary\" because tax credits and grants can be used to achieve the same objectives. She viewed the majority's decision as creating a loophole for governments to fund religion.[124] In another Establishment Clause case, *Town of Greece v. Galloway*, 572 U.S. 565 (2014), Kagan wrote a dissent arguing that a prayer at a town council meeting failed to treat all Americans the same regardless of religion.[126] *Greece* involved a town in New York inviting chaplains, for several years all Christian, to give a prayer before town council meetings.[127] Unlike *Marsh v. Chambers*, 463 U.S. 783 (1983), where the Supreme Court had permitted a state legislature to open with a prayer, Kagan noted the board in *Greece* was a forum for ordinary citizens.[128] She argued the use of prayer showed a preference for a particular religion and thus violated Americans' First Amendment rights.[128]\n\n\n\n##### Sixth Amendment[edit]\n\n\nKagan dissented in *Luis v. United States*, 578 U.S. \\_\\_\\_ (2016), where the five-justice majority held that the pretrial freezing of untainted assets not traced back to criminal activity was a violation of a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel when those assets were needed to retain counsel of the defendant's choosing.[129] The defendant, Sila Luis, had been charged with Medicare fraud, in which prosecutors alleged he illegally charged $45 million for unneeded services. The prosecutors asked a judge to freeze $2 million of Luis's assets, which Luis said she needed to pay legal bills, after she had already spent most of the $45 million she made from the alleged scheme.[130] An earlier Supreme Court case, *United States v. Monsanto*, 491 U.S. 600 (1989), held that a court could freeze a defendant's assets pretrial, including funds obtained through the alleged sale of drugs, even when those assets were being used to hire an attorney.[131] The majority sought to distinguish their holding in *Luis* from *Monsanto* based upon the nature of the funds being frozen; Luis's funds were not directly linked to her crime and Monsanto's funds were.[129][131] Kennedy dissented in *Luis* because he did not think criminal defendants should be treated differently based on how quickly they spent their illegal proceeds. Kagan agreed with Kennedy that the Court's decision created inequity and drew an arbitrary distinction, but further opined that *Monsanto* might have been wrongly decided.[131] She suggested she would be willing to overturn such precedent in the future, but declined to do so in the case at bar because Luis had not sought that relief.[129][131][130] Her vote thus rested on procedural grounds as she expressed skepticism that the government should be able to freeze the assets of a criminal defendant not yet convicted, and thus still benefiting from the presumption of innocence, by merely showing probable cause that the property will be subject to forfeiture.[131]\n\n\n\n##### Gerrymandering[edit]\n\n\nKagan wrote for the majority in *Cooper v. Harris*, 581 U.S. \\_\\_\\_ (2017), striking down the configuration of two of North Carolina's congressional districts.[132] The Court held the districts' boundaries were unconstitutional because they relied excessively on race and did not pass the strict scrutiny standard of review.[133][134][135] In a footnote, Kagan set forth a new principle, that congressional districts drawn with race as the dominant factor may be found to be an unlawful racial gerrymander even if they have another goal, such as sorting voters by political affiliation.[134] Applying this principle to the facts of the case, the Court unanimously struck down North Carolina's District 1, where state lawmakers had increased the state's black voting-age population by 4.1% even though the black population had already been able to elect preferred candidates before the district lines were redrawn.[133] The increase of black voters in District 1 resulted in a decrease of black voters in other districts.[135] The Court also struck down District 12 by a vote of 5–3 for similar shifts in its racial composition. The dissent argued that those challenging the validity of the district had not proved that race caused the change in District 12.[133] Kagan quoted Court precedent that race must only be a predominant consideration, and that challengers did not need to prove politics was not a motivating factor.[133][134]\n\n\nIn June 2019, Kagan dissented in *Rucho v. Common Cause*, a 5-4 ruling that held that partisan gerrymandering is a non-justiciable claim. Kagan wrote, \"Of all times to abandon the Court’s duty to declare the law, this was not the one. The practices challenged in these cases imperil our system of government. Part of the Court’s role in that system is to defend its foundations. None is more important than free and fair elections. With respect but deep sadness, I dissent.\"[136] Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor joined her dissent.\n\n\n\n##### Voting rights[edit]\n\n\nIn *Brnovich v. DNC*, Kagan wrote the dissenting opinion and was joined by Breyer and Sotomayor. She would have struck down the Arizona voting laws that throw out votes that are cast out-of-precinct and ban ballot harvesting. Kagan wrote that African-American, Latino, and Native American voters are disproportionately likely to have their votes thrown out for being out-of-precinct (compared to White voters). She concluded, \"The law that confronted one of this country’s most enduring wrongs; pledged to give every American, of every race, an equal chance to participate in our democracy; and now stands as the crucial tool to achieve that goal. That law, of all laws, deserves the sweep and power Congress gave it. That law, of all laws, should not be diminished by this Court.\"[137]\n\n\n\n##### Environment[edit]\n\n\nJoined by Justices Breyer and Sotomayor, Kagan dissented in *West Virginia v. EPA*, which struck down the proposed Clean Power Plan. She wrote, \"It is EPA (that's the Environmental Protection Agency, in case the majority forgot) acting to address the greatest environmental challenge of our time. So too, there is nothing special about the Plan's 'who': fossil-fuel-fired power plants. In Utility Air, we thought EPA's regulation of churches and schools highly unusual. But fossil-fuel-fired plants? Those plants pollute—a lot—and so they have long lived under the watchful eye of EPA. That was true even before EPA began regulating carbon dioxide.\" Kagan concluded, \"The subject matter of the regulation here makes the Court's intervention all the more troubling. Whatever else this Court may know about, it does not have a clue about how to address climate change. And let's say the obvious: The stakes here are high. Yet the Court today prevents congressionally authorized agency action to curb power plants' carbon dioxide emissions. The Court appoints itself—instead of Congress or the expert agency—the decision-maker on climate policy. I cannot think of many things more frightening. Respectfully, I dissent.\"[138][139]\n\n\n\n#### Writing style[edit]\n\n\nIn her first term on the Court, Kagan did not write any separate opinions, and wrote the fewest opinions of any justice. She wrote only majority opinions or dissents that more senior justices assigned to her, and in which she and a group of justices agreed upon a rationale for deciding the case. This tendency to write for a group rather than herself made it difficult to discern her own views or where she might lean in future cases.[140] She wrote the fewest opinions for the terms from 2011 through 2014, tying with Kennedy in 2011 and 2013.[141]\n\n\nKagan's writing has been characterized as conversational, employing a range of rhetorical styles.[142] She has said that she approaches writing on the Court like she used to approach the classroom, with numerous strategies to engage the reader.[143] Her opinions use examples and analogies to make them more accessible to a broad audience.[140][144]\n\n\n\n#### Other activities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The first four female U.S. Supreme Court justices: Sandra Day O'Connor, Sonia Sotomayor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Kagan, October 2010. (O'Connor is not wearing a robe because she had retired before the picture was taken).\nLike other justices, Kagan makes public appearances when she is not hearing cases.[145] In her first four years on the Court, she made at least 20 public appearances.[146] Kagan tends to choose speaking engagements that allow her to speak to students.[145]\n\n\n*Time* magazine named Kagan one of its Time 100 most influential people for 2013. Former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote the article on Kagan, calling her \"an incisive legal thinker\" and \"excellent communicator\".[147] That same year, a painting of the four women to have served as Supreme Court justices, Kagan, Sotomayor, Ginsburg, and O'Connor, was unveiled at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C.[148] In 2018, Kagan received the Marshall-Wythe Medallion from William & Mary Law School,[149] and an honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters from Hunter College.[150]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nKagan has never married. During her confirmation, a photo of her playing softball, which is sometimes characterized in popular culture as unfeminine, led to unsubstantiated claims that Kagan was a lesbian.[151] Her friends have criticized the rumors. Kagan's law school roommate Sarah Walzer said, \"I've known her for most of her adult life and I know she's straight.\"[152]\n\n\nKagan's Harvard colleagues and friends have characterized her as a good conversationalist, warm, with a good sense of humor.[153] Before joining the Supreme Court, she was known to play poker and smoke cigars.[153][154]\n\n\nEarly in her tenure as a justice, Kagan began socializing with several of her new colleagues.[155] She attended the opera with Ruth Bader Ginsburg, had dinner with Sonia Sotomayor, attended legal events with Anthony Kennedy and Clarence Thomas, and went hunting with Antonin Scalia.[155] The hunting trips stemmed from a promise Kagan made to U.S. Senator Jim Risch of Idaho during a meeting before her confirmation; Risch expressed concern that, as a New York City native, Kagan did not understand the importance of hunting to his constituents. Kagan initially offered to go hunting with Risch before promising instead to go hunting with Scalia if confirmed. According to Kagan, Scalia laughed when she told him of the promise and took her to his hunting club for the first of several hunting trips.[156] Kagan is known to spend time with longtime friends from law school and her stint in the Clinton administration rather than attending Washington, D.C., social events she is invited to as a justice.[155]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Barack Obama Supreme Court candidates\n* Bill Clinton judicial appointment controversies\n* Demographics of the Supreme Court of the United States\n* List of Jewish American jurists\n* List of law clerks of the Supreme Court of the United States (Seat 4)\n* List of law clerks of the Supreme Court of the United States (Seat 10)\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Princeton student body president and future Governor of New York, Eliot Spitzer, was one of the other students.\n2. **^** Fellowship in memory of Rhodes Scholar from Princeton, Daniel M.

She was nominated by President Barack Obama on May 10, 2010, and has served since August 7, 2010. Kagan is the fourth woman to become a member of the Court.\n\n\nKagan was born and raised in New York City. After graduating from Princeton University, Worcester College, Oxford, and Harvard Law School, she clerked for a federal Court of Appeals judge and for Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall. She began her career as a professor at the University of Chicago Law School, leaving to serve as Associate White House Counsel, and later as a policy adviser under President Bill Clinton. After a nomination to the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which expired without action, she became a professor at Harvard Law School and was later named its first female dean.\n\n\nIn 2009, Kagan became the first female solicitor general of the United States.[5] The following year, President Obama nominated her to the Supreme Court to fill the vacancy arising from the impending retirement of Justice John Paul Stevens. The United States Senate confirmed her nomination by a vote of 63–37. As of 2022, she is the most recent justice appointed without any prior judicial experience. She is considered part of the Court's liberal wing, but tends to be its most moderate justice. She has written the majority opinion in some landmark cases, such as *Cooper v. Harris*, *Chiafalo v. Washington*, and *Kisor v. Wilkie*, as well as several notable dissenting opinions, such as in *Rucho v. Common Cause*, *West Virginia v. EPA*, *Brnovich v. DNC*, *Janus v. AFSCME*, and *Seila Law v. CFPB*.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nKagan was born on April 28, 1960, in Manhattan, the second of three children[6][7] of Robert Kagan, an attorney who represented tenants trying to remain in their homes, and Gloria (Gittelman) Kagan, who taught at Hunter College Elementary School.[8][9] Both her parents were the children of Russian Jewish immigrants.[9] Kagan was raised in New York City.[10] She has two brothers, Marc and Irving.[11]\n\n\nKagan and her family lived in a third-floor apartment at West End Avenue and 75th Street,[12] and attended Lincoln Square Synagogue.[13] She was independent and strong-willed in her youth and, according to a former law partner of her father's, clashed with her Orthodox rabbi, Shlomo Riskin, over aspects of her bat mitzvah.[12] \"She had strong opinions about what a bat mitzvah should be like, which didn't parallel the wishes of the rabbi,\" her father's colleague said.[14] Kagan and Riskin negotiated a solution. Riskin had never performed a ritual bat mitzvah before.[13] She \"felt very strongly that there should be ritual bat mitzvah in the synagogue, no less important than the ritual bar mitzvah. This was really the first formal bat mitzvah we had\", he said.[13] Kagan asked to read from the Torah on a Saturday morning as the boys did, but ultimately read from the Book of Ruth on a Friday night.[13] She now practices Conservative Judaism.[13]\n\n\nKagan's childhood friend Margaret Raymond recalled that she was a teenage smoker but not a partier.[12] On Saturday nights, Raymond and Kagan were \"more apt to sit on the steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and talk.\"[12] Kagan also loved literature and reread Jane Austen's *Pride and Prejudice* every year.[12] In her 1977 Hunter College High School yearbook, she is pictured in a judge's robe and holding a gavel.[15] Next to the photo is a quotation from former Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter: \"Government is itself an art, one of the subtlest of arts.\"[16]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kagan graduates from Harvard Law School in 1986\nKagan attended Hunter College High School, where her mother taught. The school had a reputation as one of the most elite learning institutions for high school girls and attracted students from all over New York City. Kagan emerged as one of the school's more outstanding students.[17] She was elected president of the student government and served on a student-faculty consultative committee.[18] Kagan then attended Princeton University, graduating in 1981 with a Bachelor of Arts, *summa cum laude*, in history.[19] She was particularly drawn to American history and archival research.[20] She wrote a senior thesis under historian Sean Wilentz titled \"To the Final Conflict: Socialism in New York City, 1900–1933\". In it she wrote, \"Through its own internal feuding, then, the SP [Socialist Party] exhausted itself forever. The story is a sad but also a chastening one for those who, more than half a century after socialism's decline, still wish to change America.\"[21] Wilentz says Kagan did not mean to defend socialism, noting that she \"was interested in it. To study something is not to endorse it.\"[12]\n\n\nAs an undergraduate, Kagan also served as editorial chair of *The Daily Princetonian*.[19][22] Along with eight other students,[a] she penned a \"Declaration of the Campaign for a Democratic University\". It called for \"a fundamental restructuring of university governance\" and condemned Princeton's administration for making decisions \"behind closed doors\".[23] Despite the liberal tone of *The Daily Princetonian*'s editorials, Kagan was politically restrained in her dealings with fellow reporters. Her *Daily Princetonian* colleague Steven Bernstein has said he \"cannot recall a time in which Kagan expressed her political views\".[24] He described Kagan's political stances as \"sort of liberal, democratic, progressive tradition, and everything with lower case\".[24]\n\n\nIn 1980, Kagan received Princeton's Daniel M. Sachs Class of 1960 Graduating Scholarship,[b] one of the highest general awards the university confers. This enabled her to study at Worcester College, Oxford. As part of her graduation requirement, Kagan wrote a thesis called \"The Development and Erosion of the American Exclusionary Rule: A Study in Judicial Method\". It presented a critical look at the exclusionary rule and its evolution on the Supreme Court—the Warren Court, in particular.[26] She earned a Master of Philosophy in politics at Oxford in 1983.[27]\n\n\nIn 1983, at age 23, Kagan entered Harvard Law School. Her adjustment to Harvard's atmosphere was rocky; she received the worst grades of her entire law school career in her first semester. Kagan went on to earn an A in 17 of the 21 courses she took at Harvard, and she became a supervisory editor of the *Harvard Law Review*.[28] She worked as a summer associate at the Wall Street law firm Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson, where she worked in the litigation department.[29] She graduated in 1986 with a Juris Doctor *magna cum laude*.[30][31] Her friend Jeffrey Toobin recalls that Kagan \"stood out from the start as one with a formidable mind. She's good with people. At the time, the law school was a politically charged and divided place. She navigated the factions with ease, and won the respect of everyone.\"[32]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### Early career[edit]\n\n\nAfter law school, Kagan was a law clerk for judge Abner J. Mikva of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit from 1987 to 1988. She became one of Mikva's favorite clerks; he called her \"the pick of the litter\".[33] From 1988 to 1989, Kagan clerked for justice Thurgood Marshall of the U.S. Supreme Court. Marshall said he hired Kagan to help him put the \"spark\" back into his opinions as the Court had been undergoing a conservative shift since William Rehnquist became Chief Justice in 1986.[34] Marshall nicknamed the 5-foot-3-inch (1.60-metre) Kagan \"Shorty\".[12]\n\n\nFrom 1989 to 1991, Kagan was in private practice at the Washington, D.C., law firm Williams & Connolly.[35] As a junior associate, she drafted briefs and conducted discovery.[36] During her short time at the firm, she handled five lawsuits that involved First Amendment or media law issues and libel issues.[37]\n\n\nIn 1991, Kagan became an assistant professor at the University of Chicago Law School.[38] While there she first met Barack Obama, a guest lecturer at the school.[39][40] While on the UC faculty, Kagan published a law review article on the regulation of First Amendment hate speech in the wake of the Supreme Court's ruling in *R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul*;[41] an article discussing the significance of governmental motive in regulating speech;[42] and a review of a book by Stephen L. Carter discussing the judicial confirmation process.[43] In the first article, which became highly influential, Kagan argued that the Supreme Court should examine governmental motives when deciding First Amendment cases and analyzed historic draft-card burning and flag burning cases in light of free speech arguments.[44]\n\n\nIn 1993, Senator Joe Biden appointed Kagan as a special counsel for the Senate Judiciary Committee. During this time, she worked on Ruth Bader Ginsburg's Supreme Court confirmation hearings.[45]\n\n\nKagan became a tenured professor of law in 1995.[38] According to her colleagues, Kagan's students complimented and admired her from the beginning, and she was granted tenure \"despite the reservations of some colleagues who thought she had not published enough\".[12]\n\n\n\n### Clinton administration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kagan in the Oval Office with President Bill Clinton in 1997 during her tenure as Deputy Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy\nKagan served as Associate White House Counsel for Bill Clinton from 1995 to 1996, when Mikva served as White House Counsel. She worked on such issues affecting the Clinton administration as the Whitewater controversy, the White House travel office controversy, and *Clinton v. Jones*.[46] From 1997 to 1999, she worked as Deputy Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy and deputy director of the Domestic Policy Council. Kagan worked on topics like budget appropriations, campaign finance reform, and social welfare issues. Her work is catalogued in the Clinton Library.[47] Kagan coauthored a 1997 memo urging Clinton to support a ban on late-term abortions: \"We recommend that you endorse the Daschle amendment in order to sustain your credibility on HR 1122 and prevent Congress from overriding your veto.\"[48]\n\n\nOn June 17, 1999, Clinton nominated Kagan to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, to replace James L. Buckley, who took senior status in 1996. The Senate Judiciary Committee's Republican Chairman, Orrin Hatch, scheduled no hearing, effectively ending her nomination. When the Senate term ended, her nomination lapsed, as did that of fellow Clinton nominee Allen Snyder.[49][50]\n\n\n\n### Academia[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kagan as Harvard Law School dean in 2008\n![](image)Kagan's 2009 official portrait as Harvard Law School dean\nAfter her service in the White House and her lapsed judicial nomination, Kagan returned to academia in 1999. She initially sought to return to the University of Chicago, but she had given up her tenured position during her extended stint in the Clinton Administration, and the school chose not to rehire her, reportedly due to doubts about her commitment to academia.[51] Kagan quickly found a position as a visiting professor at Harvard Law School. While there, she authored a law review article on United States administrative law, focusing on the president's role in formulating and influencing federal administrative law. The article was honored as the year's top scholarly article by the American Bar Association's Section on Administrative Law and Regulatory Practice.[52]\n\n\nIn 2001, Kagan was named a full professor at Harvard Law School and in 2003 she was named dean of the Law School by Harvard University President Lawrence Summers.[53] She succeeded Robert C. Clark, who had served as dean for over a decade. The focus of her tenure was on improving student satisfaction. Efforts included constructing new facilities and reforming the first-year curriculum as well as aesthetic changes and creature comforts, such as free morning coffee. She has been credited for a consensus-building leadership style that defused the school's previous ideological discord.[54][55][56]\n\n\nAs dean, Kagan inherited a $400 million capital campaign, \"Setting the Standard,\" in 2003. It ended in 2008 with a record-breaking $476 million raised, 19% more than the original goal.[57] Kagan made a number of prominent new hires, increasing the size of the faculty considerably. Her coups included hiring legal scholar Cass Sunstein away from the University of Chicago[58] and Lawrence Lessig away from Stanford.[59] She also made an effort to hire conservative scholars, such as former Bush administration official Jack Goldsmith, for the traditionally liberal-leaning faculty.[55][60]\n\n\nAccording to Kevin Washburn, then dean of the University of New Mexico School of Law, Kagan transformed Harvard Law School from a harsh environment for students to one that was much more student-focused.[56]\n\n\n\nDuring her deanship, Kagan upheld a decades-old policy barring military recruiters from the Office of Career Services because she felt the military's \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" policy discriminated against gays and lesbians. According to Campus Progress, \n\n\n> As dean, Kagan supported a lawsuit intended to overturn the Solomon Amendment so military recruiters might be banned from the grounds of schools like Harvard. When a federal appeals court ruled The Pentagon could not withhold funds, she banned the military from Harvard's campus once again. The case was challenged in the Supreme Court, which ruled the military could indeed require schools to allow recruiters if they wanted to receive federal money. Kagan, though she allowed the military back, simultaneously urged students to demonstrate against Don't Ask, Don't Tell.[61][62]\n> \n> \n\n\nIn October 2003, Kagan sent an email to students and faculty deploring that military recruiters had shown up on campus in violation of this policy. The email read in part, \"This action causes me deep distress. I abhor the military's discriminatory recruitment policy\".[63] She also wrote that it was \"a profound wrong—a moral injustice of the first order\".[63]\n\n\nFrom 2005 to 2008, Kagan was a member of the Research Advisory Council of the Goldman Sachs Global Markets Institute. She received a $10,000 stipend for her service.[64]\n\n\nBy early 2007, Kagan was a finalist for the presidency of Harvard University after Lawrence Summers's resignation the previous year. The position ultimately went to Drew Gilpin Faust instead. Kagan was reportedly disappointed, and law school students threw her a party to express their appreciation for her leadership.[65]\n\n\n\n### Solicitor General[edit]\n\n\nOn January 5, 2009, President-elect Barack Obama announced he would nominate Kagan to be Solicitor General.[66][67] She was vetted for the position of Deputy Attorney General before her selection as Solicitor General.[68] At the time of her nomination, Kagan had never argued a case before any court.[69] At least two previous solicitors general, Robert Bork and Kenneth Starr, had no previous Supreme Court appearances.[70]\n\n\nThe two main questions senators had for Kagan during her confirmation hearings were whether she would defend statutes that she personally opposed and whether she was qualified to be Solicitor General given her lack of courtroom experience.[71] Kagan testified that she would defend laws, such as the Defense of Marriage Act, pursuant to which states were not required to recognize same-sex marriages originating in other states, \"if there is any reasonable basis to do so\".[72] The Senate confirmed her on March 19, 2009, by a vote of 61 to 31.[73] She was the first woman to hold the position.[74] Upon taking office, Kagan pledged to defend any statute as long as there was a colorable argument to be made, regardless of her personal opinions.[71] As Solicitor General, Kagan's job was to act as the lawyer for the United States and defend legislation and executive actions in appeals before the Supreme Court.[74][45] Thus the arguments she made as Solicitor General were not necessarily indicative of her personal beliefs.[74]\n\n\nKagan's first appearance before the Supreme Court was on September 9, 2009, one month before the typical start of a new term in October, in the re-argument of *Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission*, 558 U.S. 310 (2010).[75] During argument, she asked the Court to uphold a 1990 precedent that allowed the government to restrict corporations' use of their treasuries to campaign for or against political candidates. As an alternative argument, Kagan further contended that if the Court would not uphold precedent, it should keep its ruling narrowly focused on corporations that resembled the petitioning organization, Citizens United, rather than reconsidering the constitutionality of broader restrictions on corporate campaign finance.[75][76][77] In a 5–4 decision, the Court overturned precedent and allowed corporations to spend freely in elections, a major defeat for the Obama administration.[78]\n\n\nDuring her 15 months as Solicitor General, Kagan argued six cases before the Supreme Court.[79] *The Washington Post* described her style during argument as \"confident\" and \"conversational\".[74] She helped win four cases: *Salazar v. Buono*, 559 U.S. 700 (2010), *United States v. Comstock*, 560 U.S. 126 (2010), *Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project*, 561 U.S. 1 (2010), and *Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board*, 561 U.S. 477 (2010).[80][c]\n\n\n\n### Supreme Court[edit]\n\n\n#### Nomination[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Elena Kagan Supreme Court nomination\n\n![](image)Kagan meets with then President Obama in the Oval Office, April 2010, a month before nominating her to the U.S. Supreme Court\nObama nominates Kagan to be an Associate Justice for the United States Supreme Court\nBefore Obama's election, Kagan was the subject of media speculation as a potential Supreme Court nominee if a Democratic president were elected in 2008.[82] Obama had his first Supreme Court vacancy to fill in 2009 when Associate Justice David H. Souter announced his upcoming retirement.[83] Senior Obama adviser David Axelrod later recounted that during the search for a new justice, Antonin Scalia told him he hoped Obama would nominate Kagan, because of her intelligence.[84] On May 13, 2009, the Associated Press reported that Obama was considering Kagan, among others.[85] On May 26, 2009, Obama announced that he had chosen Sonia Sotomayor.[86]\n\n\nOn April 9, 2010, Justice John Paul Stevens announced he would retire at the start of the Court's summer 2010 recess, triggering new speculation about potential replacements, and Kagan was once again considered a contender.[87] In a *Fresh Dialogues* interview, Jeffrey Toobin, a Supreme Court analyst and Kagan's friend and law school classmate,[88] speculated that she would be Obama's nominee, describing her as \"very much an Obama-type person, a moderate Democrat, a consensus builder\".[89] This alarmed some liberals and progressives, who worried that \"replacing Stevens with Kagan risks moving the Court to the right, perhaps substantially to the right\".[90]\n\n\nOn May 10, 2010, Obama nominated Kagan to the Supreme Court.[91] The deans of over one-third of the country's law schools, 69 people in total, endorsed the nomination in an open letter in early June. It lauded what it called her coalition-building skills and \"understanding of both doctrine and policy\" as well as her written record of legal analysis.[92]\n\n\n\n#### Confirmation hearings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kagan, Obama, and Chief Justice John Roberts before her investiture ceremony, October 1, 2010\n![](image)Kagan (right), then a Supreme Court nominee, meets with U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen\nKagan's confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee began on June 28.[93] As they began, Kagan was expected to be confirmed, with Senator John Cornyn calling her \"justice-to-be\".[94] During the hearings, she demonstrated a deep knowledge of Supreme Court cases, expounding upon cases senators mentioned in their questions to her without taking notes on the questions. A number of Democratic senators criticized recent decisions of the court as \"activist\", but Kagan avoided joining in their criticisms.[95] Like many prior nominees, including Chief Justice John Roberts, she declined to answer whether she thought particular cases were correctly decided or how she would vote on particular issues.[95][96] Senators Jon Kyl and Arlen Specter[d] criticized her evasiveness. Specter said it obscured the way justices actually ruled once on the Court.[96] He noted that Kagan published an article in the *University of Chicago Law Review* in 1995 in which she criticized the evasiveness she came to practice.[98][94] Republican senators criticized Kagan's background as more political than judicial; she responded by promising to be impartial and fair.[93] On July 20, 2010, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 13–6 to recommend Kagan's confirmation to the full Senate. On August 5 the full Senate confirmed her nomination by a vote of 63–37.[99] The voting was largely along party lines, with five Republicans (Richard Lugar, Judd Gregg, Lindsey Graham, Susan Collins, and Olympia Snowe) supporting her and one Democrat (Ben Nelson) opposing.[100]\n\n\nKagan's swearing-in ceremony took place on August 7, 2010, at the White House. Chief Justice John Roberts administered the prescribed constitutional and judicial oaths of office, at which time she became the 112th justice (100th associate justice) of the Supreme Court.[101][102] She is the first person appointed to the Court without any prior experience as a judge since William Rehnquist and Lewis F. Powell Jr., who both became members in 1972.[103][104][105] She is the fourth female justice in the court's history,[e] and the eighth Jewish justice.[106][f]\n\n\nIdeologically, Kagan is part of the Supreme Court's liberal wing:[108][109][110] she voted with the liberal bloc in *King v. Burwell*, 576 U.S. 988 (2015), finding that Obamacare's subsidies and individual mandate are constitutional, and in *Obergefell v. Hodges*, 576 U.S. 644 (2015), which prohibits states from outlawing same-sex marriage.[111] In 2018, *Slate* observed that Kagan had crossed ideological lines on multiple cases during the preceding term, and considered her to be part of a centrist bloc along with Justices Roberts, Stephen Breyer, and Anthony Kennedy.[112] Still, *FiveThirtyEight* observed that Kagan voted with her more liberal peers, Ginsburg and Sotomayor, over 90% of the time.[113] Also during the 2017–18 term, Kagan most commonly agreed with Breyer; they voted together in 93% of cases. She agreed least often with Justice Samuel Alito, in 58.82% of cases.[114]\n\n\nBecause of her service as solicitor general, Kagan recused herself from 28 out of the 78 cases heard during her first year on the Court to avoid conflicts of interest.[115] In 2017, she recused herself from the immigrant-detention case *Jennings v. Rodriguez* because she authorized a filing in the case when she was solicitor general.[116]\n\n\nKagan was the circuit justice, the justice responsible for handling emergency requests, for the Sixth and Seventh Circuits.[117] After Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation, she was assigned to the Ninth Circuit, the largest US circuit court by area. It includes Alaska, Arizona, California, Guam, Hawaii, Idaho, Oregon, Montana, Nevada, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Washington state.[118][117]\n\n\n\n#### Jurisprudence[edit]\n\n\nKagan's first opinion as a justice, *Ransom v. FIA Card Services*, was a statutory interpretation case where the Court was tasked with determining what income a debtor was allowed to shield from creditors in bankruptcy.[119] In an 8–1 decision, she held that the Chapter 13 Bankruptcy statute precludes a debtor from taking an allowance for car-related expenses if the debtor owns the car outright and does not make loan or lease payments. She reasoned the word \"applicable\" was key to the statute, and debtors could only take allowances for car-related costs that applied.[120][121] Kagan wrote the majority opinion in *Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC*. In the 6–3 decision in favor of Marvel, she held that a patentee cannot receive royalties after the patent has expired.[122] Her opinion included several references to Spider-Man.[123]\n\n\n\n##### First Amendment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)John Roberts, Stephen Breyer, Kagan, and Neil Gorsuch at President Donald Trump's 2018 State of the Union Address\nKagan's first dissent came in the First Amendment case *Arizona Christian School Tuition Organization v. Winn*, 563 U.S. 125 (2011).[124] Writing for the liberal wing, she took issue with the majority's creation of an exception to the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.[124] The majority held that Arizona taxpayers cannot challenge tax credits for those who donate to groups that provide scholarships to religious schools, drawing a distinction between the way the Court treats tax credits and grants.[124][125] Kagan deemed this distinction \"arbitrary\" because tax credits and grants can be used to achieve the same objectives. She viewed the majority's decision as creating a loophole for governments to fund religion.[124] In another Establishment Clause case, *Town of Greece v. Galloway*, 572 U.S. 565 (2014), Kagan wrote a dissent arguing that a prayer at a town council meeting failed to treat all Americans the same regardless of religion.[126] *Greece* involved a town in New York inviting chaplains, for several years all Christian, to give a prayer before town council meetings.[127] Unlike *Marsh v. Chambers*, 463 U.S. 783 (1983), where the Supreme Court had permitted a state legislature to open with a prayer, Kagan noted the board in *Greece* was a forum for ordinary citizens.[128] She argued the use of prayer showed a preference for a particular religion and thus violated Americans' First Amendment rights.[128]\n\n\n\n##### Sixth Amendment[edit]\n\n\nKagan dissented in *Luis v. United States*, 578 U.S. \\_\\_\\_ (2016), where the five-justice majority held that the pretrial freezing of untainted assets not traced back to criminal activity was a violation of a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel when those assets were needed to retain counsel of the defendant's choosing.[129] The defendant, Sila Luis, had been charged with Medicare fraud, in which prosecutors alleged he illegally charged $45 million for unneeded services. The prosecutors asked a judge to freeze $2 million of Luis's assets, which Luis said she needed to pay legal bills, after she had already spent most of the $45 million she made from the alleged scheme.[130] An earlier Supreme Court case, *United States v. Monsanto*, 491 U.S. 600 (1989), held that a court could freeze a defendant's assets pretrial, including funds obtained through the alleged sale of drugs, even when those assets were being used to hire an attorney.[131] The majority sought to distinguish their holding in *Luis* from *Monsanto* based upon the nature of the funds being frozen; Luis's funds were not directly linked to her crime and Monsanto's funds were.[129][131] Kennedy dissented in *Luis* because he did not think criminal defendants should be treated differently based on how quickly they spent their illegal proceeds. Kagan agreed with Kennedy that the Court's decision created inequity and drew an arbitrary distinction, but further opined that *Monsanto* might have been wrongly decided.[131] She suggested she would be willing to overturn such precedent in the future, but declined to do so in the case at bar because Luis had not sought that relief.[129][131][130] Her vote thus rested on procedural grounds as she expressed skepticism that the government should be able to freeze the assets of a criminal defendant not yet convicted, and thus still benefiting from the presumption of innocence, by merely showing probable cause that the property will be subject to forfeiture.[131]\n\n\n\n##### Gerrymandering[edit]\n\n\nKagan wrote for the majority in *Cooper v. Harris*, 581 U.S. \\_\\_\\_ (2017), striking down the configuration of two of North Carolina's congressional districts.[132] The Court held the districts' boundaries were unconstitutional because they relied excessively on race and did not pass the strict scrutiny standard of review.[133][134][135] In a footnote, Kagan set forth a new principle, that congressional districts drawn with race as the dominant factor may be found to be an unlawful racial gerrymander even if they have another goal, such as sorting voters by political affiliation.[134] Applying this principle to the facts of the case, the Court unanimously struck down North Carolina's District 1, where state lawmakers had increased the state's black voting-age population by 4.1% even though the black population had already been able to elect preferred candidates before the district lines were redrawn.[133] The increase of black voters in District 1 resulted in a decrease of black voters in other districts.[135] The Court also struck down District 12 by a vote of 5–3 for similar shifts in its racial composition. The dissent argued that those challenging the validity of the district had not proved that race caused the change in District 12.[133] Kagan quoted Court precedent that race must only be a predominant consideration, and that challengers did not need to prove politics was not a motivating factor.[133][134]\n\n\nIn June 2019, Kagan dissented in *Rucho v. Common Cause*, a 5-4 ruling that held that partisan gerrymandering is a non-justiciable claim. Kagan wrote, \"Of all times to abandon the Court’s duty to declare the law, this was not the one. The practices challenged in these cases imperil our system of government. Part of the Court’s role in that system is to defend its foundations. None is more important than free and fair elections. With respect but deep sadness, I dissent.\"[136] Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor joined her dissent.\n\n\n\n##### Voting rights[edit]\n\n\nIn *Brnovich v. DNC*, Kagan wrote the dissenting opinion and was joined by Breyer and Sotomayor. She would have struck down the Arizona voting laws that throw out votes that are cast out-of-precinct and ban ballot harvesting. Kagan wrote that African-American, Latino, and Native American voters are disproportionately likely to have their votes thrown out for being out-of-precinct (compared to White voters). She concluded, \"The law that confronted one of this country’s most enduring wrongs; pledged to give every American, of every race, an equal chance to participate in our democracy; and now stands as the crucial tool to achieve that goal. That law, of all laws, deserves the sweep and power Congress gave it. That law, of all laws, should not be diminished by this Court.\"[137]\n\n\n\n##### Environment[edit]\n\n\nJoined by Justices Breyer and Sotomayor, Kagan dissented in *West Virginia v. EPA*, which struck down the proposed Clean Power Plan. She wrote, \"It is EPA (that's the Environmental Protection Agency, in case the majority forgot) acting to address the greatest environmental challenge of our time. So too, there is nothing special about the Plan's 'who': fossil-fuel-fired power plants. In Utility Air, we thought EPA's regulation of churches and schools highly unusual. But fossil-fuel-fired plants? Those plants pollute—a lot—and so they have long lived under the watchful eye of EPA. That was true even before EPA began regulating carbon dioxide.\" Kagan concluded, \"The subject matter of the regulation here makes the Court's intervention all the more troubling. Whatever else this Court may know about, it does not have a clue about how to address climate change. And let's say the obvious: The stakes here are high. Yet the Court today prevents congressionally authorized agency action to curb power plants' carbon dioxide emissions. The Court appoints itself—instead of Congress or the expert agency—the decision-maker on climate policy. I cannot think of many things more frightening. Respectfully, I dissent.\"[138][139]\n\n\n\n#### Writing style[edit]\n\n\nIn her first term on the Court, Kagan did not write any separate opinions, and wrote the fewest opinions of any justice. She wrote only majority opinions or dissents that more senior justices assigned to her, and in which she and a group of justices agreed upon a rationale for deciding the case. This tendency to write for a group rather than herself made it difficult to discern her own views or where she might lean in future cases.[140] She wrote the fewest opinions for the terms from 2011 through 2014, tying with Kennedy in 2011 and 2013.[141]\n\n\nKagan's writing has been characterized as conversational, employing a range of rhetorical styles.[142] She has said that she approaches writing on the Court like she used to approach the classroom, with numerous strategies to engage the reader.[143] Her opinions use examples and analogies to make them more accessible to a broad audience.[140][144]\n\n\n\n#### Other activities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The first four female U.S. Supreme Court justices: Sandra Day O'Connor, Sonia Sotomayor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Kagan, October 2010. (O'Connor is not wearing a robe because she had retired before the picture was taken).\nLike other justices, Kagan makes public appearances when she is not hearing cases.[145] In her first four years on the Court, she made at least 20 public appearances.[146] Kagan tends to choose speaking engagements that allow her to speak to students.[145]\n\n\n*Time* magazine named Kagan one of its Time 100 most influential people for 2013. Former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote the article on Kagan, calling her \"an incisive legal thinker\" and \"excellent communicator\".[147] That same year, a painting of the four women to have served as Supreme Court justices, Kagan, Sotomayor, Ginsburg, and O'Connor, was unveiled at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C.[148] In 2018, Kagan received the Marshall-Wythe Medallion from William & Mary Law School,[149] and an honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters from Hunter College.[150]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nKagan has never married. During her confirmation, a photo of her playing softball, which is sometimes characterized in popular culture as unfeminine, led to unsubstantiated claims that Kagan was a lesbian.[151] Her friends have criticized the rumors. Kagan's law school roommate Sarah Walzer said, \"I've known her for most of her adult life and I know she's straight.\"[152]\n\n\nKagan's Harvard colleagues and friends have characterized her as a good conversationalist, warm, with a good sense of humor.[153] Before joining the Supreme Court, she was known to play poker and smoke cigars.[153][154]\n\n\nEarly in her tenure as a justice, Kagan began socializing with several of her new colleagues.[155] She attended the opera with Ruth Bader Ginsburg, had dinner with Sonia Sotomayor, attended legal events with Anthony Kennedy and Clarence Thomas, and went hunting with Antonin Scalia.[155] The hunting trips stemmed from a promise Kagan made to U.S. Senator Jim Risch of Idaho during a meeting before her confirmation; Risch expressed concern that, as a New York City native, Kagan did not understand the importance of hunting to his constituents. Kagan initially offered to go hunting with Risch before promising instead to go hunting with Scalia if confirmed. According to Kagan, Scalia laughed when she told him of the promise and took her to his hunting club for the first of several hunting trips.[156] Kagan is known to spend time with longtime friends from law school and her stint in the Clinton administration rather than attending Washington, D.C., social events she is invited to as a justice.[155]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Barack Obama Supreme Court candidates\n* Bill Clinton judicial appointment controversies\n* Demographics of the Supreme Court of the United States\n* List of Jewish American jurists\n* List of law clerks of the Supreme Court of the United States (Seat 4)\n* List of law clerks of the Supreme Court of the United States (Seat 10)\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Princeton student body president and future Governor of New York, Eliot Spitzer, was one of the other students.\n2. **^** Fellowship in memory of Rhodes Scholar from Princeton, Daniel M.
