The group's objective—to overthrow Castro via espionage, sabotage, and other covert tactics—was never pursued.[203] In November 1961, he authorized Operation Mongoose (also known as the Cuban Project).[204] In March 1962, Kennedy rejected Operation Northwoods, proposals for false flag attacks against American military and civilian targets,[205] and blaming them on the Cuban government in order to gain approval for a war against Cuba. However, the administration continued to plan for an invasion of Cuba in the summer of 1962.[204]\n\n\n\n#### Cuban Missile Crisis[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cuban Missile Crisis\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nKennedy faced a dilemma: if the U.S. attacked the sites, it might lead to nuclear war with the Soviet Union, but if the U.S. did nothing, it would be faced with the increased threat from close-range nuclear weapons (positioned approximately 90 mi (140 km) away from the Florida coast). The U.S. would also appear to the world as less committed to the defense of the Western Hemisphere. On a personal level, Kennedy needed to show resolve in reaction to Khrushchev, especially after the Vienna summit.[210] To deal with the crisis, he formed an ad hoc body of key advisers, later known as EXCOMM, that met secretly between October 16 and 28.[211]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nKennedy's administration included high tensions with communist states in the Cold War. As a result, he increased the number of American military advisers in South Vietnam. The Strategic Hamlet Program began in Vietnam during his presidency. In April 1961, he authorized an attempt to overthrow the Cuban government of Fidel Castro in the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion. In November 1961, he authorized Operation Mongoose, also aimed at removing the communists from power in Cuba. He rejected Operation Northwoods in March 1962, but his administration continued to plan for an invasion of Cuba in the summer of 1962. The following October, U.S. spy planes discovered Soviet missile bases had been deployed in Cuba. The resulting period of tensions, termed the Cuban Missile Crisis, nearly resulted in the breakout of a global thermonuclear conflict. He also signed the first nuclear weapons treaty in October 1963. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Kennedy confers with Attorney General Robert Kennedy, c. October 1962\nThe U.S. Navy would stop and inspect all Soviet ships arriving off Cuba, beginning October 24. Several Soviet ships approached the blockade line, but they stopped or reversed course to avoid the blockade.[215] The Organization of American States gave unanimous support to the removal of the missiles. Kennedy exchanged two sets of letters with Khrushchev, to no avail.[216] United Nations (UN) Secretary General U Thant requested both parties to reverse their decisions and enter a cooling-off period. Khrushchev agreed, but Kennedy did not.[217] Kennedy managed to preserve restraint when a Soviet missile unauthorizedly downed a U.S. Lockheed U-2 reconnaissance aircraft over Cuba, killing the pilot Rudolf Anderson.[218]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMore than a third of U.S. National Security Council (NSC) members favored an unannounced air assault on the missile sites, but for some of them this conjured up an image of \"Pearl Harbor in reverse.\"[212] There was also some concern from the international community (asked in confidence), that the assault plan was an overreaction in light of the fact that Eisenhower had placed PGM-19 Jupiter missiles in Italy and Turkey in 1958. It also could not be assured that the assault would be 100% effective.[213] In concurrence with a majority-vote of the NSC, Kennedy decided on a naval blockade (or \"quarantine\"). On October 22, after privately informing the cabinet and leading members of Congress about the situation, Kennedy announced on national television the naval blockade and warned that U.S. forces would seize \"offensive weapons and associated materiel\" that Soviet vessels might attempt to deliver to Cuba.[214]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the president's direction, Robert Kennedy privately informed Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin that the U.S. would remove the Jupiter missiles from Turkey \"within a short time after this crisis was over.\"[219] On October 28, Khrushchev agreed to dismantle the missile sites, subject to UN inspections.[220] The U.S. publicly promised never to invade Cuba and privately agreed to remove its Jupiter missiles from Italy and Turkey, which were by then obsolete and had been supplanted by submarines equipped with UGM-27 Polaris missiles.[221]\n\n\nThis crisis brought the world closer to nuclear war than at any point before or after. It is considered that \"the humanity\" of both Khrushchev and Kennedy prevailed.[222] The crisis improved the image of American willpower and the president's credibility. Kennedy's approval rating increased from 66% to 77% immediately thereafter.[223]\n\n\n\n#### Latin America and communism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign policy of the John F.

The photos were shown to Kennedy on October 16; a consensus was reached that the missiles were offensive in nature and thus posed an immediate nuclear threat.[209]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBiographer Richard Reeves said that Kennedy focused primarily on the political repercussions of the plan rather than military considerations. When it proved unsuccessful, he was convinced that the plan was a setup to make him look bad.[199] He took responsibility for the failure, saying, \"We got a big kick in the leg and we deserved it. But maybe we'll learn something from it.\"[200] He appointed Robert Kennedy to help lead a committee to examine the causes of the failure.[201] The Kennedy administration banned all Cuban imports and convinced the Organization of American States to expel Cuba.[202]\n\n\n\n#### Operation Mongoose[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| John F.

Johnson, assumed the presidency upon Kennedy's death. Lee Harvey Oswald, a former U.S. Marine, was arrested for the assassination, but he was shot and killed by Jack Ruby two days later. The FBI and the Warren Commission both concluded Oswald had acted alone, but conspiracy theories about the assassination still persist. After Kennedy's death, Congress enacted many of his proposals, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Revenue Act of 1964. Kennedy ranks highly in polls of U.S. presidents with historians and the general public. His personal life has also been the focus of considerable sustained interest following public revelations in the 1970s of his chronic health ailments and extramarital affairs. Kennedy is the most recent U.S. president to have died in office.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n58. **^** Donovan 2001, pp. 172–184, 189.\n59. **^** Doyle 2015, pp. 193.\n60. **^** Brinkley 2012, pp. 20.\n61. **^** \"Record of John F.

When Kennedy took office, he privately instructed the CIA that any plan must include plausible deniability by the U.S. His public position was in opposition.[232] In June 1961, the Dominican Republic's leader was assassinated; in the days following, Undersecretary of State Chester Bowles led a cautious reaction by the nation. Robert Kennedy, who saw an opportunity for the U.S., called Bowles \"a gutless bastard\" to his face.[233]\n\n\n\n#### Laos[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Laotian Civil War\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**John Fitzgerald Kennedy** (May 29, 1917 – November 22, 1963), often referred to by his initials **JFK** and by the nickname **Jack**, was an American politician who served as the 35th president of the United States from 1961 until his assassination in 1963. He was the youngest person to assume the presidency by election and the youngest president at the end of his tenure.[2] Kennedy served at the height of the Cold War, and the majority of his foreign policy concerned relations with the Soviet Union and Cuba. A Democrat from Massachusetts, Kennedy served in both houses of the U.S. Congress prior to his presidency.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA month later, both the Soviet Union and East Berlin began blocking any further passage of East Germans into West Berlin and erected barbed wire fences, which were quickly upgraded to the Berlin Wall. Kennedy acquiesced to the wall, though he sent Vice President Johnson to West Berlin to reaffirm U.S. commitment to the enclave's defense. In the following months, in a sign of rising Cold War tensions, both the U.S. and the Soviet Union ended a moratorium on nuclear weapon testing.[186] A brief stand-off between U.S. and Soviet tanks occurred at Checkpoint Charlie in October following a dispute over free movement of Allied personnel. The crisis was defused largely through a backchannel communication the Kennedy administration had set up with Soviet spy Georgi Bolshakov.[187]\n\n\n\n#### Bay of Pigs Invasion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bay of Pigs Invasion\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n211. **^** Giglio 2006, pp. 207–208.\n212. **^** Reeves 1993, p. 387.\n213. **^** Reeves 1993, p. 388.\n214. **^** Reeves 1993, p. 389.\n215. **^** Giglio 2006, p. 220.\n216. **^** Reeves 1993, p. 390.\n217. **^** Reeves 1993, p. 403.\n218. **^** Klein, Christopher. \"How the Death of a U.S. Air Force Pilot Prevented a Nuclear War\". *History.com*.\n219. **^** Giglio 2006, pp. 225–226.\n220. **^** Reeves 1993, p. 426.\n221. **^** Kenney 2000, pp. 184–186.\n222. **^** Kenney 2000, p. 189.\n223. **^** Reeves 1993, p. 425.\n224. **^** JFK's \"Address on the First Anniversary of the Alliance for Progress\", White House reception for diplomatic cors of the Latin American republics, March 13, 1962. *Public Papers of the Presidents* – John F.

Kennedy administration\n\n![](image)Foreign trips of Kennedy during his presidency\n#### The Cold War and flexible response[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Kennedy meeting with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev in Vienna in June 1961\nOn June 4, 1961, Kennedy met with Khrushchev in Vienna and left the meeting angry and disappointed that he had allowed the premier to bully him, despite the warnings he had received. Khrushchev, for his part, was impressed with the president's intelligence but thought him as weak. Kennedy did succeed in conveying the bottom line to Khrushchev on the most sensitive issue before them, a proposed treaty between Moscow and East Berlin. He made it clear that any treaty interfering with U.S. access rights in West Berlin would be regarded as an act of war.[182] Shortly after Kennedy returned home, the Soviet Union announced its plan to sign a treaty with East Berlin, abrogating any third-party occupation rights in either sector of the city. Depressed and angry, Kennedy assumed that his only option was to prepare the country for nuclear war, which he personally thought had a one-in-five chance of occurring.[183]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nKennedy's foreign policy was dominated by American confrontations with the Soviet Union, manifested by proxy contests in the global state of tension known as the Cold War. Like his predecessors, Kennedy adopted the policy of containment, which sought to stop the spread of communism.[164] Fearful of the possibility of a global nuclear war, Kennedy implemented a defense strategy known as flexible response. This strategy relied on multiple options for responding to the Soviet Union, discouraged massive retaliation, and encouraged mutual deterrence.[165][166] In contrast to Eisenhower's warning about the perils of the military-industrial complex, Kennedy focused on rearmament. From 1961 to 1964 the number of nuclear weapons increased by 50 percent, as did the number of B-52 bombers to deliver them.[167]\n\n\n\n#### Decolonization and the Congo Crisis[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n410. **^** \"The Children of Jacqueline Kennedy\". *www.firstladies.org*.

On Election Day, Kennedy defeated Nixon in one of the closest presidential elections of the 20th century. In the national popular vote, by most accounts, Kennedy led Nixon by just two-tenths of one percent (49.7% to 49.5%), while in the Electoral College, he won 303 votes to Nixon's 219 (269 were needed to win).[154] Fourteen electors from Mississippi and Alabama refused to support Kennedy because of his support for the civil rights movement; they voted for Senator Harry F. Byrd of Virginia, as did an elector from Oklahoma.[154] Forty-three years old, Kennedy was the youngest person ever elected to the presidency (though Theodore Roosevelt was a year younger when, as vice-president, he succeeded to the presidency after the assassination of William McKinley in 1901).[155]\n\n\n\n## Presidency (1961–1963)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Presidency of John F.

He was in Texas on a political trip to smooth over frictions in the Democratic Party between liberals Ralph Yarborough and Don Yarborough (no relation) and conservative John Connally.[364] Traveling in a presidential motorcade through downtown Dallas, he was shot once in the back, the bullet exiting via his throat, and once in the head.[365]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n122. **^** *The Kennedys* Archived February 27, 2010, at the Wayback Machine. *American Experience*.

The devastating news reached the family's home in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts a day later. Kennedy felt that Joe Jr.'s reckless flight was partly an effort to outdo him.[66][67] To console himself, Kennedy set out to assemble a privately published book of remembrances of his brother, *As We Remember Joe*.[68]\n\n\n\n### Military awards[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| ![](image) | ![Bronze star](image)\n![Bronze star](image)\n![Bronze star](image)\n![](image)\n | ![](image) |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Navy and Marine Corps Medal | Purple Heart | American Defense Service Medal |\n| American Campaign Medal | Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medalwith three stars | World War II Victory Medal |\n\n\n#### Navy and Marine Corps Medal citation[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Osborne, Robert (2006). *Leading Ladies: The 50 Most Unforgettable Actresses of the Studio Era*.

The commission concluded that Oswald acted alone in killing Kennedy and that Oswald was not part of any conspiracy.[369] The results of this investigation are disputed by many.[370] The assassination proved to be a pivotal moment in U.S. history because of its impact on the nation, and the ensuing political repercussions. A 2004 Fox News poll found that 66% of Americans thought there had been a conspiracy to kill President Kennedy, while 74% thought that there had been a cover-up.[371] A Gallup Poll in November 2013 showed 61% believed in a conspiracy, and only 30% thought that Oswald did it alone.[372] In 1979, the U.S. House Select Committee on Assassinations concluded, with one third of the committee dissenting, that it believed \"that Kennedy was probably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nRobert F.

Lee Harvey Oswald, an order filler at the Texas School Book Depository from which the shots were fired, was arrested for the murder of police officer J. D. Tippit and was subsequently charged with Kennedy's assassination. He denied shooting anyone, claiming he was a patsy,[367][368] and was shot dead by Jack Ruby on November 24, before he could be prosecuted. Ruby was arrested and convicted for the murder of Oswald. Ruby successfully appealed his conviction and death sentence but became ill and died of cancer on January 3, 1967, while the date for his new trial was being set.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n190. **^** Reeves 1993, pp. 69–73.\n191. **^** \"50 Years Later: Learning From The Bay Of Pigs\".

Travell kept a \"Medicine Administration Record\", cataloging Kennedy's medications: \"injected and ingested corticosteroids for his adrenal insufficiency; procaine shots and ultrasound treatments and hot packs for his back; Lomotil, Metamucil, paregoric, phenobarbital, testosterone, and trasentine to control his diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and weight loss; penicillin and other antibiotics for his urinary-tract infections and an abscess; and Tuinal to help him sleep.\"[19]\n\n\n\n### Family incidents[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Kennedy curse\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n167. **^** Stephen G Rabe, \"John F.

Kennedy\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Kennedy family is one of the most established political families in the United States, having produced a president, three senators, three ambassadors, and multiple other representatives and politicians, both at the federal and state level. While a Congressman, Kennedy embarked on a seven-week trip to India, Japan, Vietnam, and Israel in 1951, at which point he became close with his then 25-year-old brother Robert, as well as his 27-year-old sister Patricia. Because they were several years apart in age, the brothers had previously seen little of each other. This 25,000-mile (40,000 km) trip was the first extended time they had spent together and resulted in their becoming best friends.[384] Robert would eventually play a major role in his brother's career, serving as his brother's attorney general and presidential advisor.[384] Robert would later run for president in 1968 before his assassination, while another Kennedy brother, Ted, ran for president in 1980. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nKennedy carved his location on a coconut shell and requested a boat to rescue them. Seven days after the collision, with the coconut message delivered, the *PT-109* crew were rescued.[54][55]\n\n\nAlmost immediately, the *PT-109* rescue became a highly publicized event. The story was chronicled by writer John Hersey in *The New Yorker* in 1944 (decades later it was the basis of a successful film).[55] It followed Kennedy into politics and provided a strong foundation for his appeal as a leader.[56] Hersey portrayed Kennedy as a modest, self-deprecating hero.[57] For his courage and leadership, Kennedy was awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal, and the injuries he suffered during the incident also qualified him for a Purple Heart.[56]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n22. **^** \"John F.

At the commemoration of the 25th anniversary of Kennedy's death, General Michael D. Healy, the last commander of Special Forces in Vietnam, spoke at Arlington National Cemetery. Later, a wreath in the form of the Green Beret would be placed on the grave, continuing a tradition that began the day of his funeral when a sergeant in charge of a detail of Special Forces men guarding the grave placed his beret on the coffin.[429] Kennedy was the first of six presidents to have served in the U.S. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn April 15, 1961, eight CIA-supplied B-26 bombers left Nicaragua to bomb Cuban airfields. The bombers missed many of their targets and left most of Castro's air force intact.[193] On April 17, the 1,500 U.S.-trained Cuban exile invasion force, known as Brigade 2506, landed on the beach at Playa Girón in the Bay of Pigs and immediately came under heavy fire.[194] The goal was to spark a widespread popular uprising against Castro, but no such uprising occurred.[195] No U.S. air support was provided. The invading force was defeated within three days by the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces; 114 were killed and over 1,100 were taken prisoner.[196] Kennedy was forced to negotiate for the release of the 1,189 survivors. After twenty months, Cuba released the captured exiles in exchange for a ransom of $53 million worth of food and medicine.[197] The incident made Castro feel wary of the U.S. and led him to believe that another invasion would take place.[198]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBy November 1963, there were 16,000 American military personnel in South Vietnam, up from Eisenhower's 900 advisors.[241] In the aftermath of the aborted coup in September 1963, the Kennedy administration reevaluated its policies in South Vietnam. Kennedy rejected both the full-scale deployment of ground soldiers, but also rejected the total withdrawal of U.S. forces from the country.[242] Historians disagree on whether the U.S. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Goduti, Philip A.

Early on November 23, six military pallbearers carried the flag-draped coffin into the East Room of the White House, where he lay in repose for 24 hours.[376][377] Then, the coffin was carried on a horse-drawn caisson to the Capitol to lie in state. Throughout the day and night, hundreds of thousands lined up to view the guarded casket,[378][379] with a quarter million passing through the rotunda during the 18 hours of lying in state.[378]\n\n\nKennedy's funeral service was held on November 25, at St. Matthew's Cathedral in Washington, D.C.[380] The Requiem Mass was led by Cardinal Richard Cushing, then the Archbishop of Boston.[380] It was attended by approximately 1,200 guests, including representatives from over 90 countries.[381][382] After the service, Kennedy was buried at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington County, Virginia.[383]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | ![](image)![](image)\n |\n| Presidentialspeeches | * Inaugural address\n* American University speech\n* \"We choose to go to the Moon\"\n* Report to the American People on Civil Rights\n* \"Ich bin ein Berliner\"\n* \"A rising tide lifts all boats\"\n* Remarks at Amherst College on the Arts\n* State of the Union Address\n\t+ 1961\n\t+ 1962\n\t+ 1963\n |\n| Elections | * U.S. House of Representatives elections: 1946\n* 1948\n* 1950\n* U.S. Senate elections in Massachusetts: 1952\n* 1958\n* 1960 presidential primaries\n* 1960 presidential campaign\n* Democratic National Conventions: 1956\n* 1960\n* U.S. presidential election 1960\n\t+ debates\n |\n| Personal life | * Birthplace and childhood home\n* Kennedy Compound\n* Hickory Hill\n* Wexford\n* Navy service: *PT-109*\n\t+ Biuku Gasa and Eroni Kumana\n\t+ Arthur Evans\n* *PT-59*\n* Castle Hot Springs\n* Hammersmith Farm\n* Coretta Scott King phone call\n* \"Happy Birthday, Mr. President\"\n* John F.

He concentrated his attention on international affairs, supporting the Truman Doctrine as the appropriate response to the emerging Cold War. He also supported public housing and opposed the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, which restricted the power of labor unions. Though not as vocal an anti-communist as McCarthy, Kennedy supported the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which required communists to register with the government, and he deplored the \"loss of China.\"[81] In a speech in Salem, Massachusetts on January 30, 1949, Kennedy denounced Truman and the State Department for contributing to the \"tragic story of China whose freedom we once fought to preserve. What our young men had saved [in World War II], our diplomats and our President have frittered away.\"[82][83]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nKennedy's continuation of Presidents Harry S. Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower's policies of giving economic and military aid to South Vietnam left the door open for President Johnson's escalation of the conflict.[437] At the time of Kennedy's death, no final policy decision had been made as to Vietnam, leading historians, cabinet members, and writers to continue to disagree on whether the Vietnam conflict would have escalated to the point it did had he survived.[438][439] His agreement to the NSAM 263[247] action of withdrawing 1,000 troops by the end of 1963, and his earlier 1963 speech at American University,[249] suggest that he was ready to end the Vietnam War. The Vietnam War contributed greatly to a decade of national difficulties, amid violent disappointment on the political landscape.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJFK's elder brother Joe Jr. had been the family's political standard-bearer and had been tapped by their father to seek the presidency. Joe's death during the war in 1944 changed that course and the assignment fell to JFK as the second eldest of the Kennedy siblings.[73] In the summer of 1945, Joe Kennedy Sr. made a special effort to renew the family's presence in Massachusetts (i.e., a ship-launching ceremony for the USS *Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.* to remind voters that two of his sons were war heroes). Boston mayor Maurice J. Tobin discussed the possibility of John becoming his running mate in 1946 as a candidate for lieutenant governor, but Joe Sr. preferred a congressional campaign that could send his son to Washington, where he could have national visibility.[74]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n175. **^** Dallek 2003, pp. 338–339.\n176. **^** \"Kennedy's Global Challenges\". *U.S. History: From Pre-Columbian to the New Millennium*.\n177. **^** Schlesinger 2002, pp. 606–607.\n178. **^** Meisler, Stanley (2011). *When the World Calls: The Inside Story of the Peace Corps and Its First Fifty Years*.

Kennedy's condition may have had diplomatic repercussions, as he appears to have been taking a combination of drugs to treat severe back pain during the 1961 Vienna Summit with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev. The combination included hormones, animal organ cells, steroids, vitamins, enzymes, and amphetamines, and possible potential side effects included hyperactivity, hypertension, impaired judgment, nervousness, and mood swings.[403] Kennedy at one time was regularly seen by three doctors, one of whom, Max Jacobson, was unknown to the other two, as his mode of treatment was controversial[404] and used for the most severe bouts of back pain.[405]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHoover told the attorney general that he had information that the president, as well as others in Washington, had been involved with a woman \"suspected as a Soviet intelligence agent, someone linked to East German intelligence.\" Robert Kennedy reportedly took the matter sufficiently seriously to raise it with leading Democratic and Republican figures in Congress.[422][423] Former Secret Service agent Larry Newman recalled \"morale problems\" that the president's indiscretions engendered within the Secret Service.[424]\n\n\nKennedy inspired affection and loyalty from the members of his team and his supporters.[425] According to Reeves, this included \"the logistics of Kennedy's liaisons ... [which] required secrecy and devotion rare in the annals of the energetic service demanded by successful politicians.\"[426] Kennedy believed that his friendly relationship with members of the press would help protect him from public revelations about his sex life.[427]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the aftermath of Gagarin's flight, as well as the failed Bay of Pigs invasion, Kennedy felt pressured to respond to the perceived erosion of American prestige. He asked Johnson to explore the feasibility of beating the Soviets to the Moon. Though he was concerned about the program's costs, Kennedy agreed to Johnson's recommendation that the U.S. commit to a crewed lunar landing as the major objective of the U.S. space program. In a May 25 speech, Kennedy declared,[359]\n\n\n\n\n> ... I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth. No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important for the long-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish.[360] Full text ![Wikisource has information on \"Special Message to the Congress on Urgent National Needs\"](image)\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Kennedy meetings with leaders of the March on Washington in the Oval Office, August 28, 1963\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBorn into the prominent Kennedy family in Brookline, Massachusetts, Kennedy graduated from Harvard University in 1940 before joining the U.S. Naval Reserve the following year. During World War II, he commanded a series of PT boats in the Pacific theater. Kennedy's survival following the sinking of PT-109 and his rescue of his fellow sailors made him a war hero and earned the Navy and Marine Corps Medal, but left him with serious injuries. After a brief stint in journalism, Kennedy represented a working-class Boston district in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1947 to 1953. He was subsequently elected to the U.S. Senate and served as the junior senator for Massachusetts from 1953 to 1960. While in the Senate, Kennedy published his book, *Profiles in Courage*, which won a Pulitzer Prize. Kennedy ran in the 1960 presidential election. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn July 1963, Kennedy sent W. Averell Harriman to Moscow to negotiate a treaty with the Soviets.[281] The introductory sessions included Khrushchev, who later delegated Soviet representation to Andrei Gromyko. It quickly became clear that a comprehensive test ban would not be implemented, due largely to the reluctance of the Soviets to allow inspections that would verify compliance.[282]\n\n\nUltimately, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union were the initial signatories to a limited treaty, which prohibited atomic testing on the ground, in the atmosphere, or underwater, but not underground. The U.S. Senate approved the treaty on September 23, 1963, by an 80–19 margin. Kennedy signed the ratified treaty on October 7, 1963.[283] France was quick to declare that it was free to continue developing and testing its nuclear defenses.[284]\n\n\n\n### Domestic policy[edit]\n\n\n#### New Frontier[edit]\n\n\nMain article: New Frontier\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nKennedy planned to attend Yale Law School, but canceled when American entry into World War II seemed imminent.[39] In 1940, Kennedy attempted to enter the army's Officer Candidate School. Despite months of training, he was medically disqualified due to his chronic lower back problems. On September 24, 1941, Kennedy, with the help of the director of the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) and the former naval attaché to Joe Sr., Alan Kirk, joined the United States Naval Reserve. He was commissioned an ensign on October 26, 1941,[40] and joined the staff of the Office of Naval Intelligence in Washington, D.C.[41][42][43]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Dudley, Robert L.; Shiraev, Eric (2008). *Counting Every Vote: The Most Contentious Elections in American History*.

He started off on the wrong foot by reacting aggressively to a routine Khrushchev speech on Cold War confrontation in early 1961. The speech was intended for domestic audiences in the Soviet Union, but Kennedy interpreted it as a personal challenge. His mistake helped raise tensions going into the Vienna summit.[180] The summit would cover several topics, but both leaders knew that the most contentious issue would be that of Berlin, which had been divided into two cities with the start of the Cold War. The enclave of West Berlin lay within Soviet-allied East Germany, but was supported by the U.S. and other Western powers. The Soviets wanted to reunify Berlin under the control of East Germany, partly due to the large number of East Germans who had fled to West Berlin.[181]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNavy,[430] and one of the enduring legacies of his administration was the creation in 1961 of another special forces command, the Navy SEALs,[431] which Kennedy enthusiastically supported.[432]\n\n\nKennedy's civil rights proposals led to the Civil Rights Act of 1964.[433] President Lyndon B. Johnson, Kennedy's successor, took up the mantle and pushed the landmark Civil Rights Act through a bitterly divided Congress by invoking the slain president's memory.[434][435] President Johnson then signed the Act into law on July 2, 1964. This civil rights law ended what was known as the \"Solid South\" and certain provisions were modeled after the Civil Rights Act of 1875, signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant.[436]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nKennedy's older brother Joseph P.

Another sister Kathleen Agnes \"Kick\" Kennedy died in a plane crash en route to France in 1948. His wife Jacqueline Kennedy suffered a miscarriage in 1955 and a stillbirth in 1956: a daughter informally named Arabella.[410] A son, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, died two days after birth in August 1963.\n\n\n\n### Affairs and friendships[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe *59* acted as a shield from shore fire and protected them as they escaped on two rescue landing craft at the base of the Warrior River at Choiseul Island, taking ten marines aboard and delivering them to safety.[58] Under doctor's orders, Kennedy was relieved of his command of *PT-59* on November 18, and sent to the hospital on Tulagi.[59] But by December 1943, with his health deteriorating again, Kennedy left the Pacific front and arrived in San Francisco in early January 1944.[60] After receiving treatment for his back injury at the Chelsea Naval Hospital in Massachusetts from May to December 1944, he was released from active duty.[61][41] Beginning in January 1945, Kennedy spent three more months recovering from his back injury at Castle Hot Springs, a resort and temporary military hospital in Arizona.[62][63] On March 1, 1945, Kennedy retired from the Navy Reserve on physical disability and was honorably discharged with the full rank of lieutenant.[64] When later asked how he became a war hero, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nKennedy and his wife were younger than the presidents and first ladies who preceded them, and both were popular in the media culture in ways more common to pop singers and movie stars than politicians, influencing fashion trends and becoming the subjects of numerous photo spreads in popular magazines.

The president of South Vietnam, Ngo Dinh Diem, had alienated many of his constituents by avoiding land reforms, refusing to hold free elections, and staging an anti-Communist purge. Kennedy escalated American involvement in Vietnam in 1961 by financing the South Vietnam army, increasing the number of U.S. military advisers above the levels of the Eisenhower administration, and authorizing U.S. helicopter units to provide support to South Vietnamese forces.[237]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n352. **^** Kennedy, John F.

He made the dean's list in his junior year.[32] In 1940, Kennedy completed his thesis, \"Appeasement in Munich\", about British negotiations during the Munich Agreement. The thesis was released on July 24, under the title *Why England Slept*.[33] The book was one of the first to offer information about the war and its origins, and quickly became a bestseller as a result.[34] In addition to addressing Britain's unwillingness to strengthen its military in the lead-up to World War II, the book also called for an Anglo-American alliance against the rising totalitarian powers. Kennedy became increasingly supportive of U.S. intervention in World War II, and his father's isolationist beliefs resulted in the latter's dismissal as ambassador to the United Kingdom. This created a split between the Kennedy and Roosevelt families.[35]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMuch to the chagrin of his economic advisors, who wanted him to reduce taxes, Kennedy quickly agreed to a balanced budget pledge. This was needed in exchange for votes to expand the membership of the House Rules Committee in order to give the Democrats a majority in setting the legislative agenda.[160] Kennedy focused on immediate and specific issues facing the administration and quickly voiced his impatience with pondering deeper meanings. Deputy National Security Advisor Walt Whitman Rostow once began a diatribe about the growth of communism, and Kennedy abruptly cut him off, asking, \"What do you want me to do about that today?\"[161]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi of Iran, Kennedy, and U.S. Defense Secretary Robert McNamara in the White House Cabinet Room on April 13, 1962\nPresident Kennedy ended the arms embargo that the Truman and Eisenhower administrations had enforced on Israel in favor of increased security ties, becoming the founder of the U.S.-Israeli military alliance. Describing the protection of Israel as a moral and national commitment, he was the first to introduce the concept of a 'special relationship' between the U.S. and Israel.[263] In 1962, the Kennedy administration sold Israel a major weapon system, the Hawk antiaircraft missile. Historians differ as to whether Kennedy pursued security ties with Israel primarily to shore up support with Jewish-American voters, or because of his admiration of the Jewish state.[264]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n270. **^** \"President John F.

Additionally, Robert Kennedy worked for McCarthy's subcommittee as an assistant counsel, and McCarthy dated Kennedy's sister Patricia. Kennedy told historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., \"Hell, half my voters [particularly Catholics] in Massachusetts look on McCarthy as a hero.\"[122][123] In 1954, the Senate voted to censure McCarthy, and Kennedy drafted a speech supporting the censure. However, it was not delivered because Kennedy was hospitalized for back surgery in Boston at the time.[124] The speech put Kennedy in the apparent position of participating by \"pairing\" his vote against that of another senator and opposing the censure. Although Kennedy never indicated how he would have voted, the episode damaged his support among members of the liberal community, including Eleanor Roosevelt, in the 1956 and 1960 elections.[125]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nInto late 1961, disagreements existed among Kennedy's doctors concerning his proper balance of medication and exercise. Kennedy preferred the former because he was short on time and desired immediate relief.[280] During that time, the president's physician, George Burkley, did set up some gym equipment in the White House basement, where Kennedy did stretching exercises for his back three times a week.[406] Details of these and other medical problems were not publicly disclosed during Kennedy's lifetime.[407] The President's primary White House physician, George Burkley, realized that treatments by Jacobson and Travell, including the excessive use of steroids and amphetamines, were medically inappropriate, and took action to remove Kennedy from their care.[408]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn Kennedy's State of the Union address in 1961, he suggested international cooperation in space. Khrushchev declined, as the Soviets did not wish to reveal the status of their rocketry and space capabilities.[357] In April 1961, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first person to fly in space, reinforcing American fears about being left behind in a technological competition with the Soviet Union.[358] Less than a month later, Alan Shepard became the first American to travel into space, strengthening Kennedy's confidence in NASA.[359]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n46. **^** \"USS PT 109\".

In response, the United States conducted tests five days later.[278] Shortly afterwards, new U.S. satellites began delivering images that made it clear that the Soviets were substantially behind the U.S. in the arms race.[279] Nevertheless, the greater nuclear strength of the U.S. was of little value as long as the Soviet Union perceived itself to be at parity.[280]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *Hoover vs. The Kennedys* (1987 miniseries)\n* *Thirteen Days* (2000 film)\n* *RFK* (2002 film)\n* *Bobby* (2006 film)\n* *RFK Must Die* (2007 documentary)\n* *The Kennedys* (2011 miniseries)\n* *Ethel* (2012 documentary)\n* *Killing Kennedy* (2013 film)\n* *Jackie* (2016 film)\n* *Bobby Kennedy for President* (2018 miniseries)\n |\n| Family,family tree | * Ethel Skakel (wife)\n* Kathleen Kennedy (daughter)\n* Joseph Patrick Kennedy (son)\n* Robert F.

Kennedy's father intervened by providing misleading medical records and convincing PT officers that his presence would bring publicity to the fleet.[44] Kennedy completed six months of training at the Naval Reserve Officer Training School in Chicago and at the Motor Torpedo Boat Squadrons Training Center in Melville, Rhode Island.[41][45] His first command was *PT-101* from December 7, 1942, until February 23, 1943.[42] Unhappy to be assigned to the Panama Canal, far from the fighting, Kennedy appealed to U.S. Senator David Walsh of Massachusetts, who arranged for him to be assigned to the South Pacific.[44]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the election campaign, Kennedy attacked the Eisenhower administration for losing ground on the African continent,[170] and stressed that the U.S. should be on the side of anti-colonialism and self-determination.[171] Kennedy considered the Congo Crisis to be one of the most important foreign policy issues facing his presidency, and he supported a UN operation that prevented the secession of the State of Katanga.[172] Moïse Tshombe, leader of State of Katanga, declared its independence from the Congo and the Soviet Union responded by sending weapons and technicians to underwrite their struggle.[173] On October 2, 1962, Kennedy signed United Nations bond issue bill to ensure U.S. assistance in financing UN peacekeeping operations in the Congo and elsewhere.[174]\n\n\n\n![](image)Kennedy greets Peace Corps volunteers on August 28, 1961\n#### Peace Corps[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Peace Corps\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1956, Kennedy, aided by Kenneth O'Donnell and Larry O'Brien, gained control of the Massachusetts Democratic Party,[108] and delivered the state delegation to the party's presidential nominee, Adlai Stevenson II, at the Democratic National Convention in August.[109] Stevenson let the convention select the vice presidential nominee.

Webb to head NASA.[356]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nKennedy also made two announcements: 1.) that the Soviets had expressed a desire to negotiate a nuclear test ban treaty, and 2.) that the U.S. had postponed planned atmospheric tests.[253]\n\n\n\n#### West Berlin speech[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kennedy delivering his speech in West Berlin\nIn 1963, Germany was enduring a time of particular vulnerability due to Soviet aggression to the east as well as the impending retirement of West German Chancellor Adenauer.[254] At the same time, French President Charles de Gaulle was trying to build a Franco-West German counterweight to the American and Soviet spheres of influence.[255][256][257] To Kennedy's eyes, this Franco-German cooperation seemed directed against NATO's influence in Europe.[258]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAt the start of the fall general election campaign, the Republican nominee and incumbent Vice President Richard Nixon held a six-point lead in the polls.[139] Major issues included how to get the economy moving again, Kennedy's Roman Catholicism, the Cuban Revolution, and whether the space and missile programs of the Soviet Union had surpassed those of the U.S. To address fears that his being Catholic would impact his decision-making, he told the Greater Houston Ministerial Association on September 12, 1960: \"I am not the Catholic candidate for president. I am the Democratic Party candidate for president who also happens to be a Catholic. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1962, Kennedy won approval of the Manpower Development and Training Act, a three-year program aimed at retraining workers displaced by new technology. Its impact on structural unemployment, however, was minimal.[289] At the urging of his sister Eunice Kennedy Shriver, Kennedy made intellectual disabilities a priority for his new administration. In 1963, Congress passed the Community Mental Health Act, which provided funding to local mental health community centers and research facilities.[293]\n\n\nTrade policy included both domestic and foreign policy. The 1962 Trade Expansion Act passed Congress by wide majorities. It authorized the president to negotiate tariff reductions on a reciprocal basis of up to 50 percent with the European Common Market.[294] The legislation paved the way for the Kennedy Round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations, concluding on June 30, 1967, the last day before expiration of the Act.[295]\n\n\n\n#### Taxes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe term \"Camelot\" is often used to describe his presidency, reflecting both the mythic grandeur accorded Kennedy in death, and the powerful nostalgia that millions feel for that era of American history.[445] According to Richard Dean Burns and Joseph M. Siracusa, the most popular theme surrounding Kennedy's legacy is its replay of the legend of King Arthur and Camelot from medieval England. In the days after JFK's death, his widow Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy, who herself would play a central role in the myth, approached journalist Theodore H. White. Mrs. Kennedy emphasized an image that would shape the adoring memory of JFK and his administration, highlighting the president's love for the popular Broadway musical *Camelot*. She emphasized how her husband loved the music of Alan Jay Lerner, a former classmate of his. Mrs. Kennedy claimed that JFK admired heroes like King Arthur, presenting him as an idealist, although White knew this to be untrue. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n- Ted Kennedy 1980 presidential campaign\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Books | * *My Senator and Me: A Dog's-Eye View of Washington, D.C.* (2006)\n* *True Compass* (2009)\n |\n| Speeches | * The Dream Shall Never Die\n |\n| Family,family tree | * Joan Bennett Kennedy (first wife)\n* Victoria Reggie Kennedy (second wife, widow)\n* Kara Kennedy (daughter)\n* Edward M.

During this time, Robert McNamara was serving as Secretary of Defense and one of John F. Kennedy's trusted advisors. When Kennedy received confirmation of the placement of offensive Soviet missiles in Cuba, he immediately set up the 'Executive Committee', referred to as 'ExComm'. This committee included United States government officials, such as Robert McNamara, advising Kennedy on the crisis. Kennedy instructed ExComm to immediately come up with a response to the Soviet threat unanimously without him present.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, McNamara served as a member of EXCOMM and played a large role in the Administration's handling and eventual defusing of the Cuban Missile Crisis. He was a strong proponent of the blockade option over a missile strike and helped persuade the Joint Chiefs of Staff to agree with the blockade option.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith tensions continuing to escalate, it was confirmed[*by whom?*] the crisis had to be resolved within 48 hours when the White House received two messages from Nikita Khrushchev. The first message, an informal one, stated if the United States guaranteed to not invade Cuba then they would take the missiles out. The second message, a more formal one, was broadcast on the radio stating if the United States attacked then Cuba was prepared to retaliate with masses of military power. Although American defense planning focused on using nuclear weapons, Kennedy and McNamara saw it was clear the use of strategic weapons could be suicidal.[36] Following Cuba's aftermath, McNamara stated, \"There is no such thing as strategy, only crisis management.\"[36]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMcNamara became a close adviser to Kennedy and advocated the use of a blockade during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Kennedy and McNamara instituted a Cold War defense strategy of flexible response, which anticipated the need for military responses short of massive retaliation. McNamara consolidated intelligence and logistics functions of the Pentagon into two centralized agencies: the Defense Intelligence Agency and the Defense Supply Agency. During the Kennedy administration, McNamara presided over a build-up of U.S. soldiers in South Vietnam. After the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident, the number of U.S. soldiers in Vietnam escalated dramatically. McNamara and other U.S. policymakers feared that the fall of South Vietnam to a Communist regime would lead to the fall of other governments in the region.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe advised Kennedy against the chiefs, warning that air strikes would almost certainly be metaphorically crossing the Rubicon.[33] McNamara's relations with the hawkish Joint Chiefs of Staff had been strained during the crisis, and his relations with Admiral George Anderson and General Curtis LeMay were especially testy.[34] Both Admiral Anderson and General LeMay had favored invading Cuba, welcomed the prospect of a war with Soviet Union under the grounds that a war with the Soviet Union was inevitable, and whose attitudes towards Kennedy and McNamara had verged on insubordination.[34] Admiral Anderson had at a one point ordered McNamara out of the Naval Operations Room, saying that as a civilian he was unqualified to be making decisions about naval matters, leading McNamara to say that he was the Defense Secretary and Anderson was unqualified to be ordering him to do anything.[34]  \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *Cuban Missile Crisis Revisited*.

The majority of officials favored an air attack on Cuba in hopes to destroy the missile sites, although the vote was not unanimous which brought them to other alternatives. By the end of the week, ExComm came up with four different alternative strategies to present to the president: a blockade, an air strike, an invasion, or some combination of these.[35] These actions are known as OPLAN 312, OPLAN 314 and OPLAN 316. A quarantine was a way to prevent the Soviets from bringing any military equipment in or out of Cuba.[36] During the final review of both alternatives on Sunday, October 21, upon Kennedy's request, McNamara presented the argument against the attack and for the quarantine. On Wednesday, October 24 at 10:00 am EDT, the quarantine line around Cuba went into effect.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n31. **^** Amadae, SM (2003). \"Chapter 1\". *Rationalizing Capitalist Democracy: The Cold War Origins of Rational Choice Liberalism*.

Kennedy rejected the concept of first-strike attack and emphasized the need for adequate strategic arms and defense to deter nuclear attack on the United States and its allies. U.S. arms, he maintained, must constantly be under civilian command and control, and the nation's defense posture had to be \"designed to reduce the danger of irrational or unpremeditated general war.\" The primary mission of U.S. overseas forces, in cooperation with its allies, was \"to prevent the steady erosion of the Free World through limited wars\". Kennedy and McNamara rejected massive retaliation for a posture of flexible response. The U.S. wanted choices in an emergency other than \"inglorious retreat or unlimited retaliation\", as the president put it. Out of a major review of the military challenges confronting the U.S. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to Special Counsel Ted Sorensen, Kennedy regarded McNamara as the \"star of his team, calling upon him for advice on a wide range of issues beyond national security, including business and economic matters.\"[22][*page needed*] McNamara became one of the few members of the Kennedy Administration to work and socialize with Kennedy, and he became close to Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, eventually serving as a pallbearer at the younger Kennedy's funeral in 1968.[23][*page needed*]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter the crisis, McNamara recommended to Kennedy that Admiral Anderson and General LeMay be sacked.[34] However, Kennedy was afraid of a Congressional backlash if he sacked two of the chiefs at once.[37] Moreover, Kennedy did not wish for his disagreements with the Joint Chiefs to become public and felt that sacking two of the chiefs at once would lead to speculation in the media about such a disagreement. Kennedy told McNamara: \"All right, you can fire one. Which one will it be?\"[37] Without hesitation, McNamara answered \"Anderson\".[37] Later on in 1963, a White House release announced that Admiral Anderson was the new American ambassador to Portugal.[37]\n\n\n\n### Cost reductions[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)President John F.

Kennedy had read about McNamara and his career in a *Time* magazine article on December 2, 1960, and interviewed him on December 8, with his brother and right-hand man Robert F. Kennedy also being present.[18] McNamara told Kennedy that he didn't know anything about government, to which Kennedy replied: \"We can learn our jobs together. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Joint Chiefs of Staff favored launching air strikes against the Soviet missile sites in Cuba, an opinion that McNamara did not hold. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara with U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff General Curtis LeMay at The Pentagon on April 10, 1963.

This was the same nuclear strategy planned by the Strategic Air Command (SAC), led by General Curtis LeMay. McNamara did not agree with this approach. He sought other options after seeing that this strategy could not guarantee the destruction of all Soviet nuclear weapons, thus leaving the United States vulnerable to retaliation. He educated NATO members on the Cold War doctrine of deterrence.[27][*further explanation needed*] McNamara's alternative in the doctrine of counterforce was to try to limit the United States nuclear exchange by targeting only enemy military forces.[28] This would prevent retaliation and escalation by holding Soviet cities hostage to a follow-up strike. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nKennedy had emerged as a leading critic of the war by 1967, and Johnson stated to Kearns his belief that McNamara had suffered a nervous breakdown, of which Kennedy, a close friend of McNamara, had taken advantage of.[175] Johnson told Kearns: \"Every day, Bobby [Kennedy] would call up McNamara telling him that the war was terrible and immoral, and that he had to leave\".[175] To soften the blow, Johnson claimed to Kearns that he had talked it over with McNamara and had decided to offer him the presidency of the World Bank, \"the only job he really wanted then\".[175] Johnson had chosen the job of World Bank president for McNamara because its rules prohibited the president from involving himself in the domestic affairs of member nations, which would prevent McNamara from criticizing the war after he left office.[176] Johnson's biggest fear was that if he fired McNamara, then he might join with Kennedy in criticizing him and the war; given his status as the longest-serving Defense Secretary, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Cabinet meeting with Dean Rusk, President Johnson and McNamara, 9 February 1968\nMcNamara wrote of his close personal friendship with Jacqueline Kennedy and how she demanded that he stop the killing in Vietnam.[165] As McNamara grew more and more controversial after 1966 and his differences with the President and the Joint Chiefs of Staff over Vietnam War strategy became public speculation, frequent rumors surfaced that he would leave office. By 1967, McNamara was suffering visibly from the nervous strain as he went days without shaving and he suffered spasms where his jaw would quiver uncontrollably for hours.[166] Johnson said about him: \"You know, he's a fine man, a wonderful man, Bob McNamara. He has given everything, just about everything, and, you know, we just can't afford another Forrestal\" (a reference to the first Defense Secretary, James Forrestal, who committed suicide due to work-related stress and depression).[166]  \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1962, McNamara supported a plan for mass spraying of the rice fields with herbicides in the Phu Yen mountains to starve the Viet Cong out, a plan that was only stopped when W. Averell Harriman pointed out to Kennedy that the ensuing famine would kill thousands of innocent people.[59] In late 1962, McNamara ordered planning to withdraw the American advisers from South Vietnam in 1964 as according to Pentagon calculations the war should be won by then.[60] At the time, McNamara told Kennedy: \"There is a new feeling of confidence that victory is possible\".[61]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the end of his life McNamara was a life trustee on the Board of Trustees of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), a trustee of the Economists for Peace and Security, a trustee of the American University of Nigeria, and an honorary trustee for the Brookings Institution.\n\n\nMcNamara died at his home in Washington, D.C., at 5:30 am on July 6, 2009, at the age of 93.[216][217] He is buried at the Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington County, Virginia, with the grave marker also commemorating his wives.[218]\n\n\nMcNamara's papers from his years as Secretary of Defense are housed in the John F.

These moves were significant because McNamara was abandoning President Dwight D. Eisenhower's policy of massive retaliation in favor of a flexible response strategy that relied on increased U.S. capacity to conduct limited, non-nuclear warfare.\n\n\nThe Kennedy administration placed particular emphasis on improving the ability to counter communist \"wars of national liberation\", in which the enemy avoided head-on military confrontation and resorted to political subversion and guerrilla tactics. As McNamara said in his 1962 annual report, \"The military tactics are those of the sniper, the ambush, and the raid. The political tactics are terror, extortion, and assassination.\" In practical terms, this meant training and equipping U.S. military personnel, as well as allies such as South Vietnam, for counterinsurgency operations.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Kennedy and McNamara with Iran's Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in April 1962\nThe Draft Presidential Memorandum (DPM)—intended for the White House and usually prepared by the systems analysis office—was a method to study and analyze major defense issues. Sixteen DPMs appeared between 1961 and 1968 on such topics as strategic offensive and defensive forces, NATO strategy and force structure, military assistance, and tactical air forces. OSD sent the DPMs to the services and the Joint Chief of Staff (JCS) for comment; in making decisions, McNamara included in the DPM a statement of alternative approaches, force levels, and other factors. The DPM in its final form became a decision document. The DPM was hated by the JCS and uniformed military in that it cut their ability to communicate directly to the White House.[29] The DPMs were also disliked because the systems analysis process was so heavyweight that it was impossible for any service to effectively challenge its conclusions.[29]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n24. **^** \"SecDef Histories – Robert McNamara\". *Defenselink.mil*.

Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. He remains the longest-serving secretary of defense, having remained in office over seven years. He played a major role in promoting the U.S.'s involvement in the Vietnam War.[3] McNamara was responsible for the institution of systems analysis in public policy, which developed into the discipline known today as policy analysis.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIncreased attention to conventional strength complemented these special forces preparations. In this instance, he called up reserves and also proceeded to expand the regular armed forces. Whereas active duty strength had declined from approximately 3,555,000 to 2,483,000 between 1953 (the end of the Korean War) and 1961, it increased to nearly 2,808,000 by June 30, 1962. Then the forces leveled off at around 2,700,000 until the Vietnam military buildup began in 1965, reaching a peak of nearly 3,550,000 by mid-1968, just after McNamara left office.[24] Kennedy, who was fascinated with counterinsurgency warfare, made a major push to develop the Special Forces, popularly known as the Green Berets.[25] The U.S. Army leadership was, for the most part, strongly opposed to the counterinsurgency vogue, and stoutly resisted the presidential pressure for more counterinsurgency training and forces.[26] The U.S. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n163. **^** Weiner, Tim (July 6, 2009). \"Robert S.

In February 1961, McNamara spoke in favor of intervention in Laos, saying that six AT-6 planes owned by the Central Intelligence Agency could be fitted to carry 200-pound bombs in support of General Phoumi Nosavan's forces.[46] Rusk shot down that proposal, saying his World War II experiences in Burma had taught him that bombing was ineffective in the jungles and six planes were not enough.[46] In the spring of 1961 Kennedy seriously considered intervening in Laos where the Communist Pathet Lao, supported by North Vietnam, were winning the civil war.[47] At one point, the Joint Chiefs of Staff advised sending 60,000 U.S. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Basha i Novosejt, Aurélie.  *'I made mistakes': Robert McNamara’s Vietnam war policy, 1960–1968* (Cambridge University Press, 2019) excerpt\n* Kaplan, Lawrence S.; Landa, Ronald Dean; Drea, Edward (2006). *The McNamara Ascendancy, 1961–1965*.

It aided the trend toward a few large non-competitive defense contractors serving the military. Rather than serving any useful purpose, the overhead necessary to generate information that was often in practice ignored resulted in increased costs throughout the system.[32]\n\n\nThe Readiness, Information, and Control Tables provided data on specific projects, more detailed than in the FYDP, such as the tables for the Southeast Asia Deployment Plan, which recorded by month and quarter the schedule for deployment, consumption rates, and future projections of U.S. forces in Southeast Asia.\n\n\n\n### Cuban Missile Crisis[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMcNamara maintained his involvement in politics in his later years, delivering statements critical of the Bush administration's 2003 invasion of Iraq.[207] On January 5, 2006, McNamara and most living former Secretaries of Defense and Secretaries of State met briefly at the White House with President Bush to discuss the war.[208]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nMcNamara married Margaret Craig, his teenage sweetheart, on August 13, 1940. She was an accomplished cook, and Robert's favorite dish was reputed to be her beef bourguignon.[209] Margaret McNamara, a former teacher, used her position as a Cabinet spouse to launch a reading program for young children, Reading Is Fundamental, which became the largest literacy program in the country. She died of cancer in 1981. Later that summer, her ashes were scattered by her family on a mountainside meadow at Buckskin Pass, near Snowmass Village, Colorado.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMcNamara commissioned the Vietnam Study Task Force on June 17, 1967. He was inspired by the confrontation at Harvard the previous November as he had discovered that the students he had been debating knew more about Vietnam's history than he did.[138] The task was assigned to Gelb and six officials whom McNamara instructed to examine just how and why the United States became involved in Vietnam, by answering his list of 100 questions starting with American relations with the Viet Minh in World War II.[139][140] McNamara expected them to be done by September 1967; they finished by January 1969.[140] Though Gelb was a hawk who had written pro-war speeches for the Republican Senator Jacob Javits, he and his team, which grew to 36 members by 1969, became disillusioned as they wrote the history; at one point when discussing what were the lessons of Vietnam, future general Paul F. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Cabinet\n |\n| --- |\n| Vice President | * *None* (1963–1965)\n* Hubert Humphrey (1965–1969)\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Secretary of State | * Dean Rusk (1963–1969)\n |\n| Secretary of the Treasury | * C.

He raised the proportion of Strategic Air Command (SAC) strategic bombers on 15-minute ground alert from 25% to 50%, thus lessening their vulnerability to missile attack. In December 1961, he established the United States Strike Command (STRICOM). Authorized to draw forces when needed from the Strategic Army Corps (STRAC), the Tactical Air Command, and the airlift units of the Military Air Transport Service and the military services, Strike Command had the mission \"to respond swiftly and with whatever force necessary to threats against the peace in any part of the world, reinforcing unified commands or... carrying out separate contingency operations.\" McNamara also increased long-range airlift and sealift capabilities and funds for space research and development. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn September 29, 1972, a passenger on the ferry to Martha's Vineyard recognized McNamara on board and attempted to throw him into the ocean. McNamara declined to press charges. The man remained anonymous but was interviewed years later by author Paul Hendrickson, who quoted the attacker as saying, \"I just wanted to confront (McNamara) on Vietnam.\"[213]\n\n\n\n### Final years and death[edit]\n\n\nAfter his wife's death, McNamara dated Katharine Graham, with whom he had been friends since the early 1960s.[*citation needed*] Graham died in 2001.\n\n\nIn September 2004, McNamara wed Diana Masieri Byfield, an Italian-born widow who had lived in the United States for more than 40 years. It was her second marriage. She was married to Ernest Byfield, a former OSS officer and Chicago hotel owner, thirty years her senior, whose first wife, Gladys Rosenthal Tartiere, leased her 400-acre (1.6 km²) Glen Ora estate in Middleburg, Virginia, to John F. Kennedy during his presidency.[214][215]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nKennedy, McNamara stated that \"we should take a stand in Thailand and South Vietnam\", pointedly omitting Laos from the nations in Southeast Asia to risk a war over.[48]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMcNamara's staff stressed systems analysis as an aid in decision-making on weapon development and many other budget issues. The secretary believed that the United States could afford any amount needed for national security, but that \"this ability does not excuse us from applying strict standards of effectiveness and efficiency to the way we spend our defense dollars.... You have to make a judgment on how much is enough.\"[*citation needed*] Acting on these principles, McNamara instituted a much-publicized cost reduction program, which, he reported, saved $14 billion in the five-year period beginning in 1961. Although he had to withstand a storm of criticism from senators and representatives from affected congressional districts, he closed many military bases and installations that he judged unnecessary for national security. He was equally determined about other cost-saving measures.[38]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn November 1965, McNamara, who had been a supporter of the war, first started to have doubts about the war, saying at a press conference that \"it will be a long war\", which completely contradicted his previous optimistic statements that the war would be brought to a close soon.[121] Although he was a prime architect of the Vietnam War and repeatedly overruled the JCS on strategic matters, McNamara gradually became skeptical about whether the war could be won by deploying more troops to South Vietnam and intensifying the bombing of North Vietnam, a claim he published in a book years later. He also stated later that his support of the war was given out of loyalty to administration policy. He traveled to South Vietnam many times to study the situation firsthand and became increasingly reluctant to approve the large force increments requested by the military commanders.[124][*not specific enough to verify*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)McNamara visited Jakarta, Indonesia during his tenure as World Bank President in 1968.\nRobert McNamara served as head of the World Bank from April 1968 to June 1981, when he turned 65.[191] In March 1968, McNamara's friend Senator Robert Kennedy entered the Democratic primaries with aim of challenging Johnson. Kennedy asked McNamara to tape a statement praising his leadership during the Cuban Missile Crisis with the understanding that the statement was meant for a TV ad.[166] McNamara praised Kennedy's \"shrewd diplomacy\", saying he had \"remained calm and cool, firm, but restrained, never nettled and never rattled\".[192] Though this was a violation of World Bank rules, McNamara felt guilty over refusing Kennedy's requests to resign and decline the World Bank presidency.[192] He was attacked for the tape with the *New York Times* in an editorial lambasting him for his \"poor judgement and poorer taste\".[192] For a moment, McNamara feared he would be fired from the World Bank.[192]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn an interview, McNamara said that the Domino Theory was the main reason for entering the Vietnam War. He also stated, \"Kennedy hadn't said before he died whether, faced with the loss of Vietnam, he would [completely] withdraw; but I believe today that had he faced that choice, he would have withdrawn.\"[147]\n\n\n\n### Equality of opportunity[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nUnable to gain a consensus about what to do, in September 1963, Kennedy sent McNamara and General Taylor on a \"fact-finding mission\" to South Vietnam.[68] At a meeting in the Gia Long Palace, President Diệm showed McNamara various graphs and charts that purported to be proof that the war was being won, a performance that convinced McNamara the war was as good as won.[69] Kennedy wanted a negative assessment of Diệm to justify supporting a coup, but McNamara and Taylor instead wrote about the \"great progress\" achieved by Diệm and confidently predicted that the \"bulk\" of the American advisers would leave in 1965 as by that point they predicted the VC insurgency would be crushed.[70] McNamara predicted that if Diệm continued his policies, that by 1965 the insurgency would be \"little more than organized banditry\".[71] With the CIA and the ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Articles and topics related to Robert McNamara\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nWorld Bank\n |\n| --- |\n| World Bank Group | * International Bank for Reconstruction and Development\n* International Development Association\n* International Finance Corporation\n* Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency\n* International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes\n |\n| Presidents | * Eugene Meyer\n* John J.

Take it back!\"[141] By 1969, McNamara wanted to forget the Vietnam war and did not want any reminders of his former job.[192]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n176. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Langguth 2000, p. 463.\n177. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Langguth 2000, pp. 454–455.\n178. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Langguth 2000, p. 455.\n179. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Langguth 2000, p. 460.\n180. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Langguth 2000, p. 461.\n181. **^** In *The Fog of War* he recounts saying to a friend, \"Even to this day, Kay, I don't know whether I quit or was fired?\" (See transcript Archived August 10, 2006, at the Wayback Machine)\n182. **^** Shafritz, Jay M.; Russell, E.W.; Borick, Christopher P.

However, he never believed it was wise for the United States to move in that direction because of psychological risks of relying too much on nuclear weaponry and that there would be pressure from many directions to build a larger system than would be militarily effective.[162]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. **^** Peck, David (February 2014). *Voyage Without a Harbor: The History of Western Civilization in a Nutshell*. iUniverse Com. p. 343.\n13. **^** Rich Frank: *Downfall,* Random House, 1999.\n14. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Martin p. 16.[*full citation needed*]\n15. **^** \"The Outsider\". *AmericanHeritage.com*.

McNamara's recommendations amounted to his saying that the strategy of the United States in Vietnam which had been pursued to date had failed. McNamara later stated he \"never heard back\" from Johnson regarding the memo. Largely as a result, on November 29 of that year, McNamara announced his pending resignation and that he would become President of the World Bank. Other factors were the increasing intensity of the anti-war movement in the U.S., the approaching presidential campaign in which Johnson was expected to seek re-election, and McNamara's support—over the objections of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, of construction along the 17th parallel separating South and North Vietnam of a line of fortifications running from the coast of Vietnam into Laos. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe casualty lists mounted as the number of troops and the intensity of fighting escalated. McNamara put in place a statistical strategy for victory in Vietnam. He concluded that there were a limited number of VC fighters in South Vietnam and that a war of attrition would destroy them. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMcNamara rejected the advice of the hawks, warning that steps such as bombing North Vietnam's dikes and locks to flood the farmland with the aim of causing a famine; mining the coast of North Vietnam to sink Soviet ships bringing in arms; invading Laos and Cambodia; and finally in the last resort using nuclear weapons if the other measures failed were likely to alienate world opinion and increase domestic opposition.[137] McNamara wrote: \"The picture of the world's greatest superpower killing or seriously injuring 1,000 noncombatants a week, while trying to pound a tiny backward nation into submission on an issue whose merits are hotly disputed, is not a pretty one\".[137] Finally, McNamara dismissed the Domino Theory as irrelevant since General Suharto had seized power in Indonesia in 1965 and proceeded to wipe out the Indonesian Communist Party, the third-largest in the world, killing hundreds of thousands of Indonesian Communists.[137] He argued that with Suharto in power in Indonesia, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Truman and Eisenhower administrations had committed the United States to support the French and native anti-Communist forces in Vietnam in resisting efforts by the Communists in the North to unify the country, though neither administration established actual combat forces in the war. The U.S. role—initially limited to financial support, military advice and covert intelligence gathering—expanded after 1954 when the French withdrew. During the Kennedy administration, the U.S. military advisory group in South Vietnam steadily increased, with McNamara's concurrence, from 900 to 16,000.[42] U.S. involvement escalated after the Gulf of Tonkin incidents in August 1964, involving two purported attacks on a U.S. Navy destroyer by North Vietnamese naval vessels.[44]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nImmediately thereafter, McNamara worked for a year at Price Waterhouse, a San Francisco accounting firm. He returned to Harvard in August 1940 to teach accounting in the Business School and became the institution's highest-paid and youngest assistant professor at that time.[12] Following his involvement there in a program to teach analytical approaches used in business to officers of the United States Army Air Forces, he entered the USAAF as a captain in early 1943, serving most of World War II with its Office of Statistical Control. One of his major responsibilities was the analysis of U.S. bombers' efficiency and effectiveness, especially the B-29 forces commanded by Major General Curtis LeMay in India, China, and the Mariana Islands.[13] McNamara established a statistical control unit for the XX Bomber Command and devised schedules for B-29s doubling as transports for carrying fuel and cargo over The Hump. He left active duty in 1946 with the rank of lieutenant colonel and with a Legion of Merit.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAir Force about 700 aircraft shot down over North Vietnam whose total value was about $900 million, making the bombing campaign uneconomical.[134] McNamara's doubts were encouraged by his civilian aides such as Leslie H. Gelb and John McNaughton, who complained that their wives and teenage children were chiding them as \"war criminals\" when they came home from work.[135] McNamara's own teenage son, Robert Craig McNamara, was opposed to the war and denounced his father when he came from work every day.[136] McNamara was shocked to discover that the American flag was hanging upside down in his son's bedroom as the younger McNamara told him that he was ashamed of America because of him.[130] McNaughton told McNamara that after having talked to some of the young people that \"a feeling is widely and strongly held...that 'the Establishment' is out of its mind\" and the dominant opinion was \"that we are trying to impose some U.S. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMcNamara admitted that the sort of counterinsurgency war envisioned by Kennedy with the Special Forces leading the fight had not occurred and wrote that the responsibility for this \"undoubtedly lies with bad management\" on the part of the Army.[123]\n\n\n\n#### Disenchantment[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHarkins, the officers of the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam altered a map that showed too much of South Vietnam under Viet Cong control, and massaged the statistics to make the Viet Cong appear weaker than they were.[57] McNamara's \"quantitative\" style based upon much number-crunching by computers about trends in Vietnam missed the human dimension.[56] Aspects of the war such as popular views and attitudes in South Vietnam, and that the South Vietnamese president Ngô Đình Diệm favored a \"divide and rule\" strategy of having multiple government departments compete against one another as a way of staying in power were missed by McNamara's \"quantitative\" approach as there was no way that computers could calculate these aspects of the war.[56] Though McNamara had supported plans to intervene in Laos in 1961, by 1962 he had changed his mind.[58] During a discussion with General Lyman Lemnitzer, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n38. **^** \"SecDef Histories – Robert McNamara\".

Jackson, Strom Thurmond and Stuart Symington, all of whom were very hostile to McNamara in their questioning of him.[170] Senator Thurmond reproached McNamara: \"I think it is a statement of placating the Communists. It is a statement of appeasing the Communists. It is a statement of no-win\".[172] Privately, McNamara felt that Thurmond was an \"ass\", saying he was a bigoted, ignorant Southern politician whose only values were a mindless militarism, a fervent belief in white supremacy and a fondness for marrying women far younger than himself. McNamara felt that it was beneath him to be questioned by Thurmond, which explained why he was notably truculent in his answers to him.[172]    \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nsuch criticism would be especially damaging.[176] \n\n\nWhen a reporter asked McNamara if the Stennis hearings indicated a rift between him and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, McNamara replied: \"My polices don't differ with those of the Joint Chiefs and I think they would be the first to say it\".[177] General Earle \"Bus\" Wheeler, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff had become dissatisfied with McNamara's leadership and was outraged by that remark. In response to McNamara's claim that the Joint Chiefs supported him, he proposed that the Joint Chiefs all resign in protest at McNamara's leadership.[177] General Harold K. Johnson of the Army, who erroneously blamed McNamara for Johnson's decision not to call up the Reserves in 1965, agreed to Wheeler's plan with his only regret being that he did not resign in 1965.[178] The plan collapsed when General Wallace M. Greene of the Marine Corps refused to go along with it.[178]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhen working at Ford Motor Company, McNamara resided in Ann Arbor, Michigan, rather than the usual auto executive domains of Grosse Pointe, Birmingham, and Bloomfield Hills.

But he's got too much-he's opinionated as hell-and he's made up his mind\".[84] Russell told Johnson that he should find an expert, preferably a World War II general who was \"not scared to death of McNamara\" to go to South Vietnam to say that the war was unwinnable and that the United States should pull out, advice that Johnson rejected.[83]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSenator John C.

The particular structure of this personal account is accomplished with the characteristics of an intimate dialogue.

On 22 November 1963, Kennedy was assassinated and succeeded by Lyndon Johnson. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMcNamara also advised the president that by early 1966 he would have to send 100,000 more troops to South Vietnam in order to win the war, and he would need to mobilize the Reserves and state National Guards as well.[113] Johnson accepted the first recommendation while rejecting the latter, disregarding Bundy's warnings that to send more troops would paradoxically mean less leverage over South Vietnam.[113] To mobilize the Reserves and National Guards would mean having to call up hundreds of thousands of men from civilian life, which would inevitably disrupt the economy, which in turn would require ending the peacetime economy and putting the economy on a war footing. Johnson rejected a wartime economy as imposing too many sacrifices on ordinary Americans while threatening his chances for reelection. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTo save South Vietnam, McNamara recommended that the United States make it \"emphatically clear\" its willingness to support Khánh to the hilt.[80] Other recommendations, which were accepted in a National Security Council \"action memorandum\" called for the United States to pay for an increase in the ARVN, provide the Republic of Vietnam Air Force with more planes and helicopters, and for the United States to pay for more civil servants to administer rural South Vietnam.[80] More importantly, the \"action memorandum\" redefined the Vietnam War as not only important for Asia, but for the entire world as the document asserted the global credibility of the United States was now at stake as it was claimed America's allies would lose faith in American promises if the South Vietnamese government were overthrown.[80] The \"action memorandum\" argued that to \"lose\" South Vietnam would fatally weaken American global leadership, making the war a \"test case\" of American willingness to continue as a global power.[80]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMcNamara expressed doubts about America's ability to win the war.[126] A week later at a dinner party attended by the economist John Kenneth Galbraith and Johnson's speechwriter Dick Goodwin, McNamara stated that victory was unobtainable, and the best that could be achieved was an \"honorable withdrawal\" that might save South Vietnam as a state.[127] In February 1966, during the Honolulu conference, McNamara during an \"off-the-record\" chat with a group of journalists spoke about the war in very jaded terms, stating frankly that Operation Rolling Thunder was a failure.[103] McNamara stated that North Vietnam was a backward Third World country that did not have the same advanced industrial infrastructure of First World nations, making the bombing offensive useless.[103] McNamara concluded: \"No amount of bombing can end the war\".[103] Karnow, one of the journalists present during the \"off-the-record\" conversation, described McNamara's personality as having changed, noting the Defense Secretary, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nRostow urged Johnson to send 206,000 more American troops to South Vietnam to join the half-million already there and to drastically increase the number of bombing raids on North Vietnam.[187] At that point, McNamara snapped in fury at Rostow, saying: \"What then? This goddamned bombing campaign, it's worth nothing, it's done nothing, they dropped more bombs than on all of Europe in all of World War II and it hasn't done a fucking thing!\"[188] McNamara then broke down in tears, saying to Johnson to just accept that the war could not be won and stop listening to Rostow.[189] Henry McPherson, an aide to the president, recalled the scene: \"He reeled off the familiar statistics-how we had dropped more bombs on Vietnam than on all of Europe during World War II. Then his voice broke, and there were tears on his eyes as he spoke of the futility, the crushing futility of the air war. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn December 1963, Johnson sent McNamara on another \"fact-finding mission\" to South Vietnam to assess General Minh's performance.[76] On 19 December 1963, McNamara reported the situation was \"very disturbing\" as the \"current trends, unless reversed in the next two or three months, will lead to neutralization at best or more likely to a Communist-controlled state\".[76] He also admitted that the computer models and statistics to which he had attached such importance were \"grossly in error\" and that government control of rural areas had \"in fact been deteriorating...to a far greater extent than we realized\" since July.[76] Regarding Minh's regime McNamara wrote at present \"there is no organized government in South Vietnam\".[76] Though McNamara admitted that the new regime was \"indecisive and drifting\", he advised Johnson to undertake \"more forceful moves if the situation does not show early signs of improvement\".[76] On 30 January 1964, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\ninstead decided to seek a diplomatic solution to the Laos crisis at a peace conference in Geneva in 1961–62 that ultimately led to an agreement to make Laos officially neutral in the Cold War.[53] The problems posed by the possibility of a war with China and the logistical problems of supporting a large units of troops in Laos led McNamara ultimately favor an alternative strategy of having a small number of U.S Army Special Forces operate in Laos working with American allies such as the Hmong hill tribes.[50] On 29 September 1961, the Joint Chiefs of Staff estimated to McNamara that if Chinese forces entered Laos, then the SEATO forces would need at least 15 divisions consisting of some 278, 000 men to stop them.[54] At the same time, the Joint Chiefs also estimated that the two airfields in Laos were capable of landing some 1,000 troops a day each, which would give the advantage to the Chinese.[46] Such dire assessments led Kennedy to ignore McNamara and the Joint Chiefs, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMcNamara placed a high emphasis on safety: the *Lifeguard* options package introduced the seat belt (a novelty at the time), padded visor, and dished steering wheel, which helped to prevent the driver from being impaled on the steering column during a collision.[15][16]\n\n\nAfter the Lincoln line's very large 1958, 1959, and 1960 models proved unpopular, McNamara pushed for smaller versions, such as the 1961 Lincoln Continental.\n\n\nOn November 9, 1960, McNamara became the first president of Ford Motor Company from outside the Ford family since John S. Gray in 1906.[17]\n\n\n\n## Secretary of Defense[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMcNamara's memoir, *In Retrospect: The Tragedy and Lessons of Vietnam*, published in 1995, presented an account and analysis of the Vietnam War from his point of view. According to his lengthy *New York Times* obituary, \"[h]e concluded well before leaving the Pentagon that the war was futile, but he did not share that insight with the public until late in life. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1965, in response to increased military activity in South Vietnam by VC insurgents and North Vietnamese regular forces, the U.S. began bombing North Vietnam, deployed large military forces and entered into combat in South Vietnam. McNamara's plan, supported by requests from top U.S. military commanders in Vietnam, led to the commitment of 485,000 troops by the end of 1967 and almost 535,000 by June 30, 1968. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn a memo of 19 May 1967 to the president, McNamara stated the military side of the war was going well with the Americans killing thousands of the enemy every month, but the political side was not, as South Vietnam remained as dysfunctional as ever. He wrote: \"Corruption is widespread. Real government control is confined to enclaves. There is rot in the fabric\".[137] McNamara wrote that the idea that the American forces would temporarily stabilize the situation so the South Vietnamese could take over the war themselves was flawed as the dysfunctional South Vietnamese state would never be able to win the war, thus meaning the Americans would have to stay in Vietnam for decades to come. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\narguing that the commitment of U.S troops to fight in South Vietnam and a strategic bombing campaign against North Vietnam were now required.[102] McNamara's hawkish stance on Vietnam was well known in Washington and many in the press often referred to the war as \"McNamara's war\" as he was the one in the cabinet always pressing for greater American involvement.[103]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)NATO Military Committee chairman General Adolf Heusinger meeting with McNamara at the Pentagon, 1964\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n127. **^** Langguth 2000, p. 418.\n128. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Karnow 1983, p. 500.\n129. **^** \"Project 100,000; New Standards Program\" (PDF). *RAND*.

McNamara directed the Air Force to adopt the Navy's F-4 Phantom and A-7 Corsair combat aircraft, a consolidation that was quite successful. Conversely, his actions in mandating a premature across-the-board adoption of the untested M16 rifle proved catastrophic when the weapons began to fail in combat, though later congressional investigations revealed the causes of these failures as negligence and borderline sabotage on behalf of the Army ordnance corps' officers. McNamara tried to extend his success by merging development programs as well, resulting in the TFX, later known as the F-111 dual service project to combine Navy requirements for a Fleet Air Defense (FAD) aircraft[40] and Air Force requirements for a tactical bomber. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nreporting to Johnson that he saw little evidence that he was capable of winning the war, and the United States would have to send more troops to South Vietnam.[113] Upon his return to the United States, McNamara told the press that the U.S forces in Vietnam were inflicting \"increasingly heavy losses\" on the VC, but in private told President Johnson that the situation was \"worse than a year ago\".[113]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe rest of us sat silently-I for one with my mouth open, listening to the secretary of defense talk that way about a campaign for which he had, ultimately, been responsible. I was pretty shocked\".[190]  \n\n\nShortly after McNamara departed the Pentagon, he published *The Essence of Security*, discussing various aspects of his tenure and position on basic national security issues. He did not speak out again on defense issues or Vietnam until after he left the World Bank.\n\n\n\n## World Bank president[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBy January 1969, *The Report of the Office of the Secretary of Defense Vietnam Task Force*, as the Pentagon Papers were officially titled, was finished,[144] but widely ignored within the government.[141] Gelb recalled that he presented the Papers to McNamara early that year, but McNamara did not read them then,[140] and Gelb did not know as late as 2018 if McNamara ever did.[145] Intended as the official record of US military involvement in Indochina, the final report ran to 7,000 pages[146][144] and was classified as \"Top Secret – Sensitive.\"[139] The report was ultimately leaked in 1971 to *The New York Times* by Daniel Ellsberg, a former aide to McNamara's Assistant Secretary of Defense, John McNaughton.[144] The leaked study became known as the Pentagon Papers, revealing that McNamara and others had been aware that the Vietnam offensive was futile.[146][144] Subsequent efforts by the Nixon administration to prevent such leaks led indirectly to the Watergate scandal. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMcNamara grew increasingly skeptical of the efficacy of committing U.S. troops to South Vietnam. In 1968, he resigned as secretary of defense to become president of the World Bank. He served as president until 1981, shifting the focus of the World Bank from infrastructure and industrialization towards poverty reduction. After retiring, he served as a trustee of several organizations, including the California Institute of Technology and the Brookings Institution. In his later writings and interviews, he expressed regret for the decisions he made during the Vietnam War.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and career[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nVann's reports criticizing Diệm's regime as corrupt and incompetent were most unwelcome to McNamara who contended that the reforms advocated by Vann were unnecessary.[65] In March 1963, Vann resigned from the Army as he was informed that his career was over. After the Battle of Ap Bac, a debate began in the Kennedy cabinet about the viability of the Diệm regime, which was reinforced by the Buddhist crisis, which began in May 1963.[66] When he of supporting a coup against Diệm was first raised by Kennedy at a National Security Council meeting in August 1963, McNamara spoke in favor of retaining Diệm.[67] On 31 August 1963, Paul Kattenburg, a diplomat newly returned from Saigon suggested at a meeting attend by Rusk, McNamara and Vice President Johnson that the United States should end support for Diệm and leave South Vietnam to its fate.[68] McNamara was stoutly opposed to Kattenburg's suggestion, saying \"we have been winning the war\".[68]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIt was also generally thought that Systems Analysis, rather than being objective, was tailored by the civilians to support decisions that McNamara had already made.[29]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| External videos |\n| --- |\n| ![video icon](image) *Booknotes* interview with Deborah Shapley on *Promise and Power*, March 21, 1993, C-SPAN |\n| ![video icon](image) *Booknotes* interview with McNamara on *In Retrospect*, April 23, 1995, C-SPAN |\n\n\nIn 1993, Washington journalist Deborah Shapley published a 615-page biography of Robert McNamara titled *Promise and Power: The Life and Times of Robert McNamara*. Shapley concluded her book with these words: \"For better and worse McNamara shaped much in today's world—and imprisoned himself. A little-known nineteenth century writer, F.W. Boreham, offers a summation: 'We make our decisions. And then our decisions turn around and make us.'\"[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe President's announcement of McNamara's move to the World Bank stressed his stated interest in the job and that he deserved a change after seven years as Secretary of Defense (longer than any of his predecessors or successors).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMcCormack, and the Senate Majority Leader, Mike Mansfield, to announce \"I've had enough of this\".[105] Only Mansfield and the Vice President, Hubert Humphrey, objected to Johnson's plans to bomb North Vietnam.[105] Aircraft from the carrier, USS *Ranger*, launched Operation Flaming Dart bombing the North Vietnamese army base at Đồng Hới later that day.[105] McNamara was forced to tell Johnson that the Flaming Dart raids had done little damage owing to the heavy clouds, which caused the pilots to miss when dropping their bombs, and more raids would be needed.[106] On 11 February, Johnson ordered more bombing raids, and 2 March approved Operation Rolling Thunder, a strategic bombing offensive against North Vietnam that was originally planned to last eight weeks, and instead went on for three years.[107] After the bombing raids started, General William Westmoreland of the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV), \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDue to the nuclear arms race, the Vietnam War buildup and other projects, Total Obligational Authority (TOA) increased greatly during the McNamara years. Fiscal year TOA increased from $48.4 billion in 1962 (equal to $373 billion in 2023) to $49.5 ($365) billion in 1965 (before the major Vietnam increases) to $74.9 ($501) billion in 1968, McNamara's last year in office (though he left office in February).[39] Not until FY 1984 did DoD's total obligational authority surpass that of FY 1968 in constant dollars.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n#### Program consolidation[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1972, McNamara visited Santiago to meet President Salvador Allende to discuss the latter's policy of nationalization, especially of the copper mining companies.[195] McNamara's son, Craig McNamara was living in Chile at the time, but the two did not meet owing to the rift over the Vietnam war.[196] McNamara *fils* stated in 1984: \"I think my father truly respected Allende-his compassion, his humility. But he disapproved of the nationalizations\".[195] The meeting with Allende concluded with McNamara ending all World Bank loans to Chile.[195] On 11 September 1973, Allende was overthrown in a coup d'etat led by General Augusto Pinochet. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nresponsibility and corresponding fecklessness on the Vietnamese side\".[112] Bundy argued that it was the responsibility of the South Vietnamese government to stop the VC and that if the Americans continued to do all the fighting, then the United States would lack the necessary leverage to pressure Saigon into making reforms, turning \"...the conflict into a white man's war, with the United States in the shoes of the French\".[112] To resolve the debate, later in July 1965, McNamara visited South Vietnam on yet another \"fact-finding mission\" for President Johnson and met the new South Vietnamese Premier, Air Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ, who had just overthrown Khánh.[113] Air Marshal Kỳ wore a flamboyant uniform which he had designed himself of a white jacket, black pants, red socks and black shoes which led McNamara to dub him as looking \"like a saxophone player in a second-rate nightclub\".[113] McNamara was not impressed with Kỳ, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nmaking the question of the bombing restrictions meaningless.[170] McNamara described all of the 57 restricted targets as either of no importance such as a tire factory in Hanoi that produced only 30 tires per day or carried too much risk of hitting Soviet ships bringing supplies to North Vietnam.[171] He warned that the prospect of American bombers damaging or sinking Soviet merchantmen while wounding or killing Soviet sailors carried too much risk of causing World War Three.[171] McNamara testified that the bombing campaign had failed to reduce the supplies coming down the Ho Chi Minh Trail as the Viet Cong needed only 15 tons of supplies per day to continue to fight and \"even if the quantity were five times that amount, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBy June 1965, Westmoreland was reporting that South Vietnam was faced with a \"collapse\", which would require 180,000 troops to stop, which would be just a \"stopgap\", and another 100,000 troops would be needed \"to seize the initiative from the enemy\".[111] McNamara's advice in July 1965 to Johnson was to commit more 180,000 troops to South Vietnam together with a stepped up aerial offensive to destroy North Vietnam's economy was called by Bundy \"rash to the point of folly\".[112] Bundy stated that for Johnson to agree to McNamara's request to send more troops \"was a slippery slope toward total U.S. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1995, he took a stand against his own conduct of the war, confessing in a memoir that it was 'wrong, terribly wrong'.\" In return, he faced a \"firestorm of scorn\" at that time.[3] In November 1995, McNamara returned to Vietnam, this time visiting Hanoi.[204] Despite his role as one of the architects of Operation Rolling Thunder, McNamara met with a surprisingly warm reception, even from those who survived the bombing raids, and was often asked to autograph pirate editions of *In Retrospect* which had been illegally translated and published in Vietnam.[205] During his visit, McNamara met his opposite number during the war, General Võ Nguyên Giáp who served as North Vietnam's Defense Minister.[205] The American historian Charles Neu who was present at the McNamara-Giáp meeting observed the differences in the style of the two men with McNamara repeatedly interrupting Giáp to ask questions, usually related to something numerical, while Giáp gave a long leisurely monologue, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHerrick of the *Maddox* reported that the \"torpedo boats\" were almost certainly just radar \"blips\" caused by the \"freak weather effects\" of the storm and the reports of an attack on his ship were due to an \"overeager\" radar operator who mistook the motors of the ship for the rush of torpedoes.[90] Johnson promptly seized upon the reports of an attack on a Navy warship in international waters to ask Congress to pass a resolution giving him the authority to wage war in Vietnam.[90] McNamara, via Admiral U.

Two of its main practitioners during the McNamara era, Alain C. Enthoven and K. Wayne Smith, described the concept as follows: \"First, the word 'systems' indicates that every decision should be considered in as broad a context as necessary... The word 'analysis' emphasizes the need to reduce a complex problem to its component parts for better understanding. Systems analysis takes a complex problem and sorts out the tangle of significant factors so that each can be studied by the method most appropriate to it.\" Enthoven and Smith said they used mainly civilians as systems analysts because they could apply independent points of view to force planning. McNamara's tendency to take military advice into less account than had previous secretaries and to override military opinions contributed to his unpopularity with service leaders. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThey complained of \"overtly restrictive controls\" in bombing North Vietnam that they claimed were preventing them from winning the war.[168] When McNamara himself appeared as a witness before the Senate Armed Forces Committee on 25 August 1967, he defended the war in very lukewarm terms that strongly suggested he had lost faith in the war, testifying that the bombing campaign against North Vietnam was ineffective, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe World Bank currently has a scholarship program under his name.[198]\n\n\nAs World Bank President, he declared at the 1968 Annual Meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group that countries permitting birth control practices would get preferential access to resources. During the emergency in India, McNamara remarked \"At long last, India is moving to effectively address its population problem,\" regarding the forced sterilization.[199][200][201]\n\n\n\n## Post-World Bank activities and assessments[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1981 to 1984, McNamara served on the Board of Trustees at American University in Washington, D.C.[202]\n\n\nHe was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1981.[203]\n\n\nIn 1982, McNamara joined several other former national security officials in urging that the United States pledge to not use nuclear weapons first in Europe in the event of hostilities; subsequently he proposed the elimination of nuclear weapons as an element of NATO's defense posture.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTo commemorate President Harry S Truman's signing an order to end segregation in the military, McNamara issued Directive 5120.36 on July 26, 1963. This directive, *Equal Opportunity in the Armed Forces*, dealt directly with the issue of racial and gender discrimination in areas surrounding military communities. The directive declared, \"Every military commander has the responsibility to oppose discriminatory practices affecting his men and their dependents and to foster equal opportunity for them, not only in areas under his immediate control, but also in nearby communities where they may live or gather in off-duty hours.\" (para. II.C.)[148] Under the directive, commanding officers were obligated to use the economic power of the military to influence local businesses in their treatment of minorities and women. With the approval of the Secretary of Defense, the commanding officer could declare areas off-limits to military personnel for discriminatory practices.[149]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter reviewing the separate and often uncoordinated service efforts in intelligence and communications, McNamara in 1961 consolidated these functions in the Defense Intelligence Agency and the Defense Communications Agency (the latter originally established by SoD Thomas S. Gates Jr. in 1960), having both report to the Secretary of Defense through the JCS. The end effect was to remove the Intelligence function from the control of the military and to put it under the control of the Secretary of Defense. In the same year, he set up the Defense Supply Agency to work toward unified supply procurement, distribution, and inventory management under the control of the Secretary of Defense rather than the uniformed military.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe applied metrics (body counts) to determine how close to success his plan was.[120] Faced with a guerrilla war, the question of holding territory was irrelevant as the VC never operated for extended periods in areas where the Americans were strong and if the Americans occupied an area in force, the VC simply moved to other areas where the American presence was weaker.[120] Westmoreland had decided, with the support of McNamara, to defend all of South Vietnam, believing that he could win via a strategy of attrition as he would simply inflict enough losses to end the enemy's ability to wage war.[121] McNamara devised the \"body count\" measurement to determine how well the Americans were doing, reasoning if the Americans were inflicting heavy losses as measured by the \"body count\", it must be a sign that they were winning.[120] General William Peers wrote critically of the \"body count\" strategy, stating: \"...with improper leadership, 'body count' could create competition between units, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\ncabled Johnson to say that Da Nang Air Base was vulnerable as he had no faith in the ability of the South Vietnamese to protect it, leading him to ask for American troops to be deployed instead.[108] On 8 March 1965, two battalions from the United States Marine Corps were landed at Danang, making the beginning of the ground war for the United States.[109] On 20 April, McNamara urged Johnson to send 40,000 troops to Vietnam, advice that was accepted.[110]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOthers give a different view of McNamara's departure from office. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nArmy sabotaged the efforts of Kennedy and McNamara to develop a more counterinsurgency role by simply declaring that the Army's basic unit, the division, was flexible enough to engage against guerrillas while also promising that the traditional fondness for using maximum firepower would not present a problem as firepower use would be \"discriminating\".[122] In Vietnam, this led to divisions, whose size limited them and their supply trains to the road, using massive amounts of firepower against guerrillas who were often \"nimble\" enough to evade all of the firepower brought to bear.[123] Instead, the standard tactics of bringing massive firepower to bear in the form of napalm and artillery strikes against the guerrillas often killed civilians, fueling support for the VC.[123] The Special Forces did fight in Vietnam, but only as an adjutant to the traditional infantry and armored divisions, which did most of the fighting.[123] In a 1966 memo, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 2 January 1963, McNamara's rosy projections and assumptions based upon what his computers had told him about Vietnam were rudely shattered by the Battle of Ap Bac, that began when three Viet Cong (VC) companies were encircled by the ARVN's 7th Division in the village of Ap Bac.[62] Despite being outnumbered by a factor of 10–1 and being outgunned having only rifles compared to the 7th Division’s tanks, artillery, armored personnel carriers and helicopters, the VC defeated the 7th Division in the ensuing battle and escaped into the jungle.[63] Colonel John Paul Vann, the American adviser attached to the 7th Division summed up the battle in a report in his usual earthy language as: \"A miserable fucking performance, just like what it always is\".[63] Vann, a colorful figure whose outspokenly blunt criticism of how the war was being fought made him a favorite of the media, was much disliked by McNamara, who did not appreciate the criticism as he continued to insist that the war was being won.[64]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn short, their weakness was their strength\".[85] One South Vietnamese minister told Karnow at the time: \"Our big advantage over the Americans is that they want to win the war more than we do\".[85] To compensate for the weaknesses of the South Vietnamese state, by late winter of 1964, senior officials in the Johnson administration such as McNamara's deputy, William Bundy, the assistant secretary of defense, were advocating American intervention in the war.[86] Such intervention presented a constitutional problem: to intervene on the scale envisioned would mean waging war, and only Congress had the legal power to declare war.[86] Fearful of causing a war with China, Johnson was opposed to the plans of Khánh to invade North Vietnam, and he was even less enthusiastic about having the United States invade North Vietnam.[82] To declare war on North Vietnam would lead to irresistible political pressure at home to invade North Vietnam. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nStarting as manager of planning and financial analysis, McNamara advanced rapidly through a series of top-level management positions. McNamara had Ford adopt computers to construct models to find the most efficient, rational means of production, which led to much rationalization.[14] McNamara's style of \"scientific management\" with his use of computer spreadsheets featuring graphs showing trends in the auto industry were regarded as extremely innovative in the 1950s and were much copied by other executives in the following decades.[14] In his 1995 memoirs, McNamara wrote: \"I had spent fifteen years as a manager [at Ford] identifying problems and forcing organizations—often against their will—to think deeply and realistically about alternative courses of action and their consequences\".[14] He was a force behind the Ford Falcon sedan, introduced in the fall of 1959—a small, simple and inexpensive-to-produce counter to the large, expensive vehicles prominent in the late 1950s. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* John W.

He then attended Harvard Business School, where he earned an M.B.A. in 1939.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nGeneral Earle Wheeler, pressed very strongly for the reserves and national guards to be called out, saying the war was steadily ruining the U.S. Army.[116] Though McNamara warned the president in July 1965 that the war would cost an extra $10 billion dollars in defense spending over the next year, Johnson at a press conference said his administration would be spending only an extra $300–400 million dollars until January 1966.[117] McNamara warned that the increased spending would spark inflation and raise the deficit, advising Johnson to ask Congress to increase taxes to forestall those eventualities.[117] Johnson responded that Congress would not vote for higher taxes, leading McNamara to argue that the president should at least try, saying \"I would rather fight for what's right and fail than not try\".[117] Johnson snapped: \"Goddammit, Bob, that's what's wrong with you-you aren't a politician\".[117]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nYou haven't read it, and if you have, you obviously didn't understand it\".[130] When the student answered that he had read the International Control Commission's report and it did not say that, McNamara responded he had been a far better university student than his opponent, saying \"I was tougher than you then and I'm tougher today! I was more courteous then, and I hope I'm more courteous today!\".[131] As McNamara continued to insult the crowd and the mood grew uglier, he fled into Quincy House, from which he escaped via underground tunnels to see Kissinger.[132] The confrontation with the students had shaken him, and it took half an hour before he was ready to address Kissinger's class.[132]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAmong the management tools developed to implement PPBS were the Five Year Defense Plan (FYDP), the Draft Presidential Memorandum (DPM), the Readiness, Information and Control Tables, and the Development Concept Paper (DCP). The annual FYDP was a series of tables projecting forces for eight years and costs and manpower for five years in mission-oriented, rather than individual service, programs. By 1968, the FYDP covered ten military areas: strategic forces, general-purpose forces, intelligence and communications, airlift and sealift, guard and reserve forces, research and development, central supply and maintenance, training and medical services, administration and related activities, and support of other nations.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe charged that McNamara had placed too many restrictions on bombing North Vietnam to protect innocent North Vietnamese civilians.[168] The chairman of the Senate Armed Forces Committee, Senator Richard Russell Jr., was opposed to the war, but he expressed his opposition in the most cautious and lukewarm terms as he did not wish to appear unpatriotic, and so the hawkish Stennis enjoyed more power than his title of deputy chairman of the committee would suggest.[169]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHowever, many analysts[*who?*] believe that even though the TFX project itself was a failure, McNamara was ahead of his time as the trend in fighter design has continued toward consolidation—the F-16 Falcon and F/A-18 Hornet emerged as multi-role fighters, and most modern designs combine many of the roles the TFX would have had. In many ways, the Joint Strike Fighter is seen as a rebirth of the TFX project, according to defense analyst David S. Grantham, in that it purports to satisfy the needs of three American air arms (as well as several foreign customers), fulfilling the roles of strike fighter, carrier-launched fighter, V/STOL, and close air support (and drawing many criticisms similar to those leveled against the TFX).[41]\n\n\n\n### Vietnam War[edit]\n\n\n#### Into Vietnam[edit]\n\n\nSee also: McNamara Taylor mission, Cable 243, and 1963 South Vietnamese coup\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBut the discouraging truth is that, as was the case in 1961 and 1963 and 1965, we have not found the formula, the catalyst, for training and inspiring them into effective action\".[128]\n\n\nIn October 1966, he launched Project 100,000, the lowering of military Armed Forces Qualification Test standards, which allowed 354,000 additional men to be recruited, despite criticism that they were not suited to working in high-stress or dangerous environments.[129]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Political offices\n |\n| --- |\n| Preceded byThomas Gates\n |  **United States Secretary of Defense** 1961–1968\n | Succeeded byClark Clifford\n |\n| Diplomatic posts\n |\n| Preceded byGeorge Woods\n |  **President of the World Bank Group** 1968–1981\n | Succeeded byTom Clausen\n |\n| Business positions\n |\n| Preceded byHenry Ford II\n |  **President of the Ford Motor Company** November 9, 1960 – January 1, 1961\n | Succeeded byJohn Dykstra\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCongress approved the resolution a vote on August 10, 1964, with only Senators Wayne Morse (D-OR), and Ernest Gruening (D-AK), voting against,[96] Concurrent with his efforts to pass the resolution, President Johnson had ordered Operation Pierce Arrow, retaliatory air strikes on North Vietnamese naval bases. The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, authorizing the president \"to take all necessary measures to repel any armed attack against the forces of the U.S. and to prevent further aggression.\" Regardless of the particulars of the incident, the larger issue turned out to be the sweeping powers granted by the resolution. It gave Johnson virtually unfettered authority to expand retaliation for a relatively minor naval incident into a major land war involving 500,000 American soldiers. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe couple had two daughters and a son. The son Robert Craig McNamara, who as a student objected to the Vietnam War, is now a walnut and grape farmer in California.[210] He is the owner of Sierra Orchards in Winters, California. Daughter Kathleen McNamara Spears is a forester with the World Bank.[211] The second daughter is Margaret Elizabeth Pastor.[3]\n\n\nIn the Errol Morris documentary, McNamara reports that both he and his wife were stricken with polio shortly after the end of World War II. Although McNamara had a relatively short stay in the hospital, his wife's case was more serious and it was concern over meeting her medical bills that led to his decision to not return to Harvard but to enter private industry as a consultant at Ford Motor Company.\n\n\n\n### At Ford[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\ntroops into Laos.[48] However, Laos appeared to be a backward, landlocked country with barely any modern roads and only two modern airfields, both of which were quite small by Western standards, which would have made for a logistical nightmare.[49] Furthermore, memories of the Korean War were still fresh, and it was generally accepted if the United States sent in troops into Laos, it was almost certain that China would do likewise, thus leading to another Sino-American war.[50] The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) was split with its European members such as France and Britain opposed to intervention in Laos, while its Asian members such as Thailand and the Philippines were all for intervention in Laos.[51] McNamara noted to Kennedy it was quite possible that the two airfields in Laos could be seized by the Communist forces, which would cut off any U.S forces in Laos, thus turning the intervention into a debacle.[48] At a meeting on 29 April 1961, when questioned by the Attorney General, Robert F. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBecause the effects of Operation Rolling Thunder were more easily measured than with the ground war, McNamara was especially troubled by the revelation that the bombing offensive had not caused the collapse of North Vietnam's economy as predicted.[133] In June 1967, American bombers hit North Vietnam's hydroelectric plants and reduced North Vietnam capacity to generate electricity by 85%, according to McNamara's calculations.[134] At the same time, he also calculated that the annual amount of electricity generated in North Vietnam was equal only to a fifth of the electricity generated every year at the Potomac Electric Power Company's plant in Alexandria, Virginia, making the destruction of North Vietnamese power plants meaningless to the outcome of the war as the amount of electricity generated was so small.[134] He also calculated in 1967 that over the last two years, American bombers had inflicted damage on North Vietnam equal to about $300 million while at the same time, Rolling Thunder had cost the U.S. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n149. **^** While the directive was passed in 1963, it was not until 1967 that the first non-military establishment was declared off-limits.

I've already made my decision\".[195] McNamara *fils* feels that his father's claim that he had to cease loans to Chile because the Allende government's nationalization policy was an \"economic\" matter that fell within the purview of the World Bank, but human rights abuses under Pinochet were a \"political\" matter that was outside of the World Bank's purview was disingenuous and dishonest. Craig McNamara stated: \"I was really upset by that. That was hard to mend\".[197]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nit could be transported by only a few trucks\".[170] McNamara went on to say that the bombing raids had not damaged the North Vietnamese economy which was \"agrarian and simple\" and the North Vietnamese people were unfamiliar with \"the modern comforts and conveniences that most of us in the Western world take for granted\".[170] McNamara also stated that North Vietnamese morale was not broken by the bombing offensive as the North Vietnamese people were \"accustomed to discipline and are no strangers to deprivation and death\" while everything indicated the leadership in Hanoi were not affected by the bombing raids.[170] Thus, he lacked \"any confidence that they can be bombed to the negotiating table\".[170] McNamara concluded that only some sort of genocide could actually win the war, stating: \"Enemy operations in the south cannot, on the basis of any reports I have seen be stopped by air bombardment-short, that is, of the virtual annihilation of North Vietnam and its people\".[170]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe advised Johnson not to accept Westmoreland's call for an additional 200,000 soldiers as that would mean calling up the Reserves, which in turn would require a wartime economy.[137] The economic sacrifices that ending the peacetime economy would entail would make it almost politically impossible to negotiate peace, and in effect would mean placing the hawks in charge, which was why those of a hawkish inclination kept pressing for the Reserves to be called up.[137] The economic sacrifices could only be justified to the American people by saying the war would be brought to a victorious conclusion. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe most notable example[30] of systems analysis was the Planning, Programming and Budgeting System (PPBS) instituted by United States Department of Defense Comptroller Charles J. Hitch. McNamara directed Hitch to analyze defense requirements systematically and produce a long-term, program-oriented defense budget. PPBS evolved to become the heart of the McNamara management program. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs such, the solution was floated for Congress to pass a resolution granting Johnson the power to wage war in Vietnam.[86]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### Expulsion of the Chagos islanders[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Forced expulsion of the Chagossians\n\nIn July 1961, McNamara was informed by the British Defence Minister, Peter Thorneycroft, that the financial burden of trying to maintain British forces around the world was too much, and that the British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan was considering a withdrawal of all British forces \"East of Suez\" to end the British military presence in Asia.[150] McNamara was opposed to this and the U.S. Navy began lobbying for Britain to allow an American naval base to be set up in the Indian Ocean. This was endorsed in a Joint Chiefs of Staff memo in January 1962 which expressed concern with the rise nationalist movements in British colonies, that could seek the withdrawal of American forces.[151]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBy 1964, the U.S. Navy sent destroyers into the Gulf of Tonkin to support raids by South Vietnamese commandos on North Vietnam and to gather intelligence.[87] On 2 August 1964, one destroyer, the USS *Maddox* was involved in a naval skirmish with North Vietnamese Vietnam People's Navy torpedo boats within North Vietnamese waters.[88] On 4 August 1964, the *Maddox* and another destroyer, the USS *Turner Joy*, initially claimed to have been attacked by the North Vietnamese torpedo boats in international waters on a stormy night, but shortly afterward reported there was probably no attack.[89] Captain John J. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nGeneral Minh was overthrown in a bloodless coup d'état by General Nguyễn Khánh.[77] The change in leadership did not affect the war. Lyman Kirkpatrick of the CIA reported in February 1964 after visiting Saigon that he was \"shocked by the number of our people and of the military, even those whose job is always to say we are winning, who feel the tide is against us\".[78] The same month saw a VC battalion in the Mekong Delta escape from a larger force of South Vietnamese troops, who had been rated as some of the very best in the ARVN by the American advisers who had trained them, a battle that underscored the problems in the ARVN.[78]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAlthough South Vietnam by 1964 was receiving a sum of American economic and military aid that ran to $2 million per day, the South Vietnamese state was falling apart with corruption reaching such a point that most South Vietnamese civil servants and soldiers were not being paid while the projects for \"rural pacification\" that the United States had paid for had collapsed as the money had instead been stolen.[85] The advice that McNamara and other American officials gave to the South Vietnamese to make reforms to crack down on corruption and make the government more effective was always ignored as by this point the South Vietnamese government knew very well that the Americans, having repeatedly promised in public that they would never permit the \"loss\" of South Vietnam, were now prisoners of their own rhetoric.[85] The threats to withhold aid were bluffs, which the South Vietnamese exposed by simply ignoring the American advice, leading to a situation whereby Stanley Karnow, \n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_QwcuSVTlZ6xUwujKHvV1VFbO","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Similarly, Lorraine Bayard de Volo[197] has suggested that the masculine brinksmanship of the Cuban Missile Crisis has become a 'touchstone of toughness by which presidents are measured'. Actions in 1962 would go on to have a significant influence on the future policy decisions of those who occupied the White House, leading to foreign policy decisions such as President Lyndon B. Johnson's escalation of the war in Vietnam three years following the crisis.[198]\n\n\n\n### Human casualties[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n103. **^** Sampson, Charles S., ed.

Kennedy thought the chance of escalation to war was \"between 1 in 3 and even\", and what we have learned in later decades has done nothing to lengthen those odds. We now know, for example, that in addition to nuclear-armed ballistic missiles, the Soviet Union had deployed 100 tactical nuclear weapons to Cuba, and the local Soviet commander there could have launched these weapons without additional codes or commands from Moscow. The US air strike and invasion that were scheduled for the third week of the confrontation would likely have triggered a nuclear response against American ships and troops, and perhaps even Miami. The resulting war might have led to the deaths of over 100 million Americans and over 100 million Russians.[204][205]\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Cuban Missile Crises was solved in part by an secret agreement by John F. Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev. The Kennedy-Khrushchev Pact was known only by 9 U.S. officials at the time of its creation in October 1963 and was the first time officially acknowledged at a conference in Moscow in January 1989 by Soviet Ambassador Dobrynin and Kennedy's speechwriter Theodore Sorensen.[171][172][173] In his negotiations with the Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin, Robert Kennedy informally proposed that the Jupiter missiles in Turkey would be removed[173] \"within a short time after this crisis was over\".[174]: 222 Under an operation code-named *Operation Pot Pie,*[175][153][154][155][156] the removal of the Jupiters from Italy and Turkey began on April 1, and was completed by April 24, 1963. The initial plans were to recycle the missiles for use in other programs, but NASA and the USAF were not interested in retaining the missile hardware. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n179. **^** Garthoff, Raymond L.

Not wanting to expose what he already knew and to avoid panicking the American public,[88] Kennedy did not reveal that he was already aware of the missile buildup.[89] By October 19, frequent U-2 spy flights showed four operational sites.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Operational plans[edit]\n\n\nTwo Operational Plans (OPLAN) were considered. OPLAN 316 envisioned a full invasion of Cuba by Army and Marine units, supported by the Navy, following Air Force and naval airstrikes. Army units in the US would have had trouble fielding mechanised and logistical assets, and the US Navy could not supply enough amphibious shipping to transport even a modest armoured contingent from the Army.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nArguably, the most dangerous moment in the crisis was not recognized until the Cuban Missile Crisis Havana conference, in October 2002. Attended by many of the veterans of the crisis, they all learned that on October 27, 1962, USS *Beale* had tracked and dropped signalling depth charges (the size of hand grenades) on *B-59*, a Soviet Project 641 (NATO designation Foxtrot) submarine. Unknown to the US, it was armed with a 15-kiloton nuclear torpedo.[201] Running out of air, the Soviet submarine was surrounded by American warships and desperately needed to surface. An argument broke out among three officers aboard *B-59*, including submarine captain Valentin Savitsky, political officer Ivan Semyonovich Maslennikov, and Deputy brigade commander Captain 2nd rank (US Navy Commander rank equivalent) Vasily Arkhipov. An exhausted Savitsky became furious and ordered that the nuclear torpedo on board be made combat ready. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ![United Kingdom](image) Peter Thorneycroft\n* ![United Kingdom](image) Sir Thomas Pike\n* ![Italy](image) Amintore Fanfani\n* ![Italy](image) Giulio Andreotti\n* ![Turkey](image) Cemal Gürsel\n* ![Turkey](image) İlhami Sancar\n |\n| Strength |\n| ![Soviet Union](image) 40,000 soldiers[3] | \n100,000-180-000 (estimated) |\n| Casualties and losses |\n| \nNone | ![United States](image) 1 U-2 spy aircraft lost![United States](image) 1 U.S pilot killed |\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversal Newsreel about the Cuban Missile Crisis\nThe **Cuban Missile Crisis**, also known as the **October Crisis (of 1962)** (Spanish: *Crisis de Octubre*) in Cuba, or the **Missile Scare**, was a 13-day confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union, when American deployments of nuclear missiles in Italy and Turkey were matched by Soviet deployments of nuclear missiles in Cuba. The crisis lasted from October 16 to October 28, 1962. The confrontation is widely considered the closest the Cold War came to escalating into full-scale nuclear war.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe EXCOMM agreed that the missiles would affect the *political* balance. Kennedy had explicitly promised the American people less than a month before the crisis that \"if Cuba should possess a capacity to carry out offensive actions against the United States... the United States would act.\"[86]: 674–681 Further, US credibility among its allies and people would be damaged if the Soviet Union appeared to redress the strategic imbalance by placing missiles in Cuba. Kennedy explained after the crisis that \"it would have politically changed the balance of power. It would have appeared to, and appearances contribute to reality.\"[87]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe charged the Kennedy administration with covering up a major threat to the US, thereby starting the crisis.[54] He may have received this initial \"remarkably accurate\" information from his friend, former congresswoman and ambassador Clare Boothe Luce, who in turn received it from Cuban exiles.[55] A later confirming source for Keating's information possibly was the West German ambassador to Cuba, who had received information from dissidents inside Cuba that Soviet troops had arrived in Cuba in early August and were seen working \"in all probability on or near a missile base\" and who passed this information to Keating on a trip to Washington in early October.[56] Air Force General Curtis LeMay presented a pre-invasion bombing plan to Kennedy in September, and spy flights and minor military harassment from US forces at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base were the subject of continual Cuban diplomatic complaints to the US government.[17]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn October 28, Kennedy participated in telephone conversations with Eisenhower[168] and fellow former US President Harry Truman.[169] In these calls, Kennedy revealed that he thought the crisis would result in the two superpowers being \"toe to toe\"[168] in Berlin by the end of the following month and expressed concern that the Soviet setback in Cuba would \"make things tougher\"[169] there. He also informed his predecessors that he had rejected the public Soviet offer to withdraw from Cuba in exchange for the withdrawal of US missiles from Turkey.[168][169]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n22. **^** Prados, John; Jimenez-Bacardi, Arturo, eds.

The Kennedy administration had been quick to set up a Cuba Task Force—with strong representation from CIA's Directorate of Plans—and on August 31 that unit decided to adopt a public posture of ignoring Castro while attacking civilian targets inside Cuba: 'our covert activities would now be directed toward the destruction of targets important to the [Cuban] economy' (Document 4)...While acting through Cuban revolutionary groups with potential for real resistance to Castro, the task force 'will do all we can to identify and suggest targets whose destruction will have the maximum economic impact.' The memorandum showed no concern for international law or the unspoken nature of these operations as terrorist attacks.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt 4:00 pm EDT, Kennedy recalled members of EXCOMM to the White House and ordered that a message should immediately be sent to U Thant asking the Soviets to suspend work on the missiles while negotiations were carried out. During the meeting, General Maxwell Taylor delivered the news that the U-2 had been shot down. Kennedy had earlier claimed he would order an attack on such sites if fired upon, but he decided to not act unless another attack was made. Forty years later, McNamara said:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nKennedy met with members of EXCOMM and other top advisers throughout October 21, considering two remaining options: an air strike primarily against the Cuban missile bases or a naval blockade of Cuba.[89] A full-scale invasion was not the administration's first option. McNamara supported the naval blockade as a strong but limited military action that left the US in control. The term \"blockade\" was problematic – according to international law, a blockade is an act of war, but the Kennedy administration did not think that the Soviets would be provoked to attack by a mere blockade.[92] Additionally, legal experts at the State Department and Justice Department concluded that a declaration of war could be avoided if another legal justification, based on the Rio Treaty for defence of the Western Hemisphere, was obtained from a resolution by a two-thirds vote from the members of the Organization of American States (OAS).[93]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n114. **^** Boyland, Vista; Nowlin, Klyne D.

Kennedy believed that yet another failure to gain control and stop communist expansion would irreparably damage US credibility. He was determined to \"draw a line in the sand\" and prevent a communist victory in Vietnam. He told James Reston of *The New York Times* immediately after his Vienna summit meeting with Khrushchev, \"Now we have a problem making our power credible and Vietnam looks like the place.\"[192][193]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn October 16, President Kennedy notified Attorney General Robert Kennedy that he was convinced the Soviets were placing missiles in Cuba and it was a legitimate threat. This made the threat of nuclear destruction by two world superpowers a reality. Robert Kennedy responded by contacting the Soviet Ambassador, Anatoly Dobrynin. Robert Kennedy expressed his \"concern about what was happening\" and Dobrynin \"was instructed by Soviet Chairman Nikita S. Khrushchev to assure President Kennedy that there would be no ground-to-ground missiles or offensive weapons placed in Cuba\". Khrushchev further assured Kennedy that the Soviet Union had no intention of \"disrupting the relationship of our two countries\" despite the photo evidence presented before President Kennedy.[80]\n\n\n\n### Responses considered[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAt 5:00 pm EDT on October 25, William Clements announced that the missiles in Cuba were still actively being worked on. That report was later verified by a CIA report that suggested there had been no slowdown at all. In response, Kennedy issued Security Action Memorandum 199, authorizing the loading of nuclear weapons onto aircraft under the command of SACEUR, which had the duty of carrying out first air strikes on the Soviet Union. Kennedy claimed that the blockade had succeeded when the USSR turned back fourteen ships presumably carrying offensive weapons.[117] The first indication of this came from a report from the British GCHQ sent to the White House Situation Room containing intercepted communications from Soviet ships reporting their positions. On October 24, *Kislovodsk,* a Soviet cargo ship, reported a position north-east of where it had been 24 hours earlier indicating it had \"discontinued\" its voyage and turned back towards the Baltic. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAt 9:00 pm EDT, the EXCOMM met again to review the actions for the following day. Plans were drawn up for air strikes on the missile sites as well as other economic targets, notably petroleum storage. McNamara stated that they had to \"have two things ready: a government for Cuba, because we're going to need one; and secondly, plans for how to respond to the Soviet Union in Europe, because sure as hell they're going to do something there\".[142]\n\n\n\nAt 12:12 am EDT, on October 27, the US informed its NATO allies that \"the situation is growing shorter.... the United States may find it necessary within a very short time in its interest and that of its fellow nations in the Western Hemisphere to take whatever military action may be necessary.\" To add to the concern, at 6:00 am, the CIA reported that all missiles in Cuba were ready for action.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn October 25 at 1:45 am EDT, Kennedy responded to Khrushchev's telegram by stating that the US was forced into action after receiving repeated assurances that no offensive missiles were being placed in Cuba, and when the assurances proved to be false, the deployment \"required the responses I have announced.... I hope that your government will take necessary action to permit a restoration of the earlier situation.\"\n\n\n\n![](image)A declassified map used by the US Navy's Atlantic Fleet showing the position of American and Soviet ships at the height of the crisis\n### Blockade challenged[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Radchenko, Sergey; Zubok, Vladislav (May–June 2023). \"Blundering on the Brink: The Secret History and Unlearned Lessons of the Cuban Missile Crisis\". *Foreign Affairs*. **102** (3): 44–63.\n* Russell, Bertrand (1963). *Unarmed Victory*.

At 5:00 pm, he met with Congressional leaders, who contentiously opposed a blockade and demanded a stronger response. In Moscow, US Ambassador Foy D. Kohler briefed Khrushchev on the pending blockade and Kennedy's speech to the nation. Ambassadors around the world gave notice to non-Eastern Bloc leaders. Before the speech, US delegations met with Canadian Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, French President Charles de Gaulle and Secretary-General of the Organization of American States, José Antonio Mora to brief them on this intelligence and the US's proposed response. All were supportive of the US position. Over the course of the crisis, Kennedy had daily telephone conversations with Macmillan, who was publicly supportive of US actions.[98]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Soviet First Secretary, Nikita Khrushchev, also had an impression of Kennedy as weak, which to him was confirmed by the President's response during the Berlin Crisis of 1961, particularly to the building of the Berlin Wall by East Germany to prevent its citizens from emigrating to the West.[36] The half-hearted nature of the Bay of Pigs invasion reinforced Khrushchev and his advisers impression that Kennedy was indecisive and, as one Soviet aide wrote, \"too young, intellectual, not prepared well for decision making in crisis situations... too intelligent and too weak\".[19] Speaking to Soviet officials in the aftermath of the crisis, Khrushchev asserted, \"I know for certain that Kennedy doesn't have a strong background, nor, generally speaking, does he have the courage to stand up to a serious challenge.\" He also told his son Sergei that on Cuba, Kennedy \"would make a fuss, make more of a fuss, and then agree\".[37][*page needed*]\n\n\n\n## Prelude[edit]\n\n\n### Conception[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n19. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Absher, Kenneth Michael (2009). \"Mind-Sets and Missiles: A First Hand Account of the Cuban Missile Crisis\".

In fact, the US at that time *led* the Soviets by a wide margin, which would only increase over time. In 1961, the Soviets had only four R-7 Semyorka intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). By October 1962, some intelligence estimates indicated a figure of 75.[35]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Jones, John A.; Jones, Virginia H.

The Soviets changed their minds, fearing possible future Cuban militant steps, and on November 22, 1962, Deputy Premier of the Soviet Union Anastas Mikoyan told Castro that the rockets with the nuclear warheads were being removed as well.[47]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt this point, the crisis was ostensibly at a stalemate. The Soviets had shown no indication that they would back down and had made public media and private inter-governmental statements to that effect. The US had no reason to believe otherwise and was in the early stages of preparing for an invasion, along with a nuclear strike on the Soviet Union if it responded militarily, which the US assumed it would.[119] Kennedy had no intention of keeping these plans a secret; with an array of Cuban and Soviet spies forever present, Khrushchev was quickly made aware of this looming danger.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nKhrushchev knew he was losing control. President Kennedy had been told in early 1961 that a nuclear war would likely kill a third of humanity, with most or all of those deaths concentrated in the US, the USSR, Europe and China;[161] Khrushchev may well have received similar reports from his military.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAccounts differ about whether Arkhipov convinced Savitsky not to make the attack or whether Savitsky himself finally concluded that the only reasonable choice left open to him was to come to the surface.[202]: 303, 317 During the conference, McNamara stated that nuclear war had come much closer than people had thought. Thomas Blanton, director of the National Security Archive, said, \"A guy called Vasily Arkhipov saved the world.\"\n\n\n\n### Possibility of nuclear launch[edit]\n\n\nIn early 1992, it was confirmed that Soviet forces in Cuba had already received tactical nuclear warheads for their artillery rockets and Il-28 bombers when the crisis broke.[203] Castro stated that he would have recommended their use if the US invaded despite Cuba being destroyed.[203]\n\n\nFifty years after the crisis, Graham Allison wrote:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Allison, Graham T.

He was persuaded to give the matter time and continue with both military and diplomatic pressure. He agreed and ordered the low-level flights over the island to be increased from two per day to once every two hours. He also ordered a crash program to institute a new civil government in Cuba if an invasion went ahead.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt this point, Khrushchev knew things the US did not. First, that the shooting down of the U-2 by a Soviet missile violated direct orders from Moscow, and Cuban anti-aircraft fire against other US reconnaissance aircraft also violated direct orders from Khrushchev to Castro.[158] Second, the Soviets already had 162 nuclear warheads on Cuba that the US did not then believe were there.[159] Third, the Soviets and Cubans on the island would almost certainly have responded to an invasion by using those nuclear weapons, even though Castro believed that every human in Cuba would likely die as a result.[160] Khrushchev also knew but may not have considered the fact that he had submarines armed with nuclear weapons that the US Navy may not have known about.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCastro, on the other hand, was convinced that an invasion of Cuba was soon at hand, and on October 26, he sent a telegram to Khrushchev that appeared to call for a pre-emptive nuclear strike on the US in case of attack. In a 2010 interview, Castro expressed regret about his 1962 stance on first use: \"After I've seen what I've seen, and knowing what I know now, it wasn't worth it at all.\"[126] Castro also ordered all anti-aircraft weapons in Cuba to fire on any US aircraft;[127] previous orders had been to fire only on groups of two or more. At 6:00 am EDT on October 27, the CIA delivered a memo reporting that three of the four missile sites at San Cristobal and both sites at Sagua la Grande appeared to be fully operational. It also noted that the Cuban military continued to organise for action but was under order not to initiate action unless attacked.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n24. **^** Brenner, Philip (2002). \"Turning History on its Head\". *National Security Archive*.

General Curtis LeMay told the President that the resolution of the crisis was the \"greatest defeat in our history\"; his was a minority position.[83] He had pressed for an immediate invasion of Cuba as soon as the crisis began and still favored invading Cuba even after the Soviets had withdrawn their missiles.[189] Twenty-five years later, LeMay still believed that \"We could have gotten not only the missiles out of Cuba, we could have gotten the Communists out of Cuba at that time.\"[115]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTerrorist attacks were planned at the direction and with the participation of US government employees and launched from US territory.[25] In January 1962, US Air Force General Edward Lansdale described the plans to overthrow the Cuban government in a top-secret report, addressed to Kennedy and officials involved with Operation Mongoose.[26][17] CIA agents or \"pathfinders\" from the Special Activities Division were to be infiltrated into Cuba to carry out sabotage and organization, including radio broadcasts.[27] In February 1962, the US launched an embargo against Cuba,[28] and Lansdale presented a 26-page, top-secret timetable for implementation of the overthrow of the Cuban government, mandating guerrilla operations to begin in August and September. \"Open revolt and overthrow of the Communist regime\" was hoped by the planners to occur in the first two weeks of October.[17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy May, Khrushchev and Castro agreed to place strategic nuclear missiles secretly in Cuba. Like Castro, Khrushchev felt that a US invasion of Cuba was imminent and that to lose Cuba would do great harm to the communists, especially in Latin America. He said he wanted to confront the Americans \"with more than words.... the logical answer was missiles\".[48]: 29 The Soviets maintained their tight secrecy, writing their plans longhand, which were approved by Marshal of the Soviet Union Rodion Malinovsky on July 4 and Khrushchev on July 7.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The engine of the Lockheed U-2 shot down over Cuba on display at Museum of the Revolution in Havana\nOn the morning of October 27, a U-2F (the third CIA U-2A, modified for air-to-air refuelling) piloted by USAF Major Rudolf Anderson,[131] departed its forward operating location at McCoy AFB, Florida. At approximately 12:00 pm EDT, the aircraft was struck by an SA-2 surface-to-air missile launched from Cuba. The aircraft crashed, and Anderson was killed. Stress in negotiations between the Soviets and the US intensified; only later was it assumed that the decision to fire the missile was made locally by an undetermined Soviet commander, acting on his own authority. Later that day, at about 3:41 pm EDT, several US Navy RF-8A Crusader aircraft, on low-level photo-reconnaissance missions, were fired upon.\n\n\nOn October 28, 1962, Khrushchev told his son Sergei that the shooting down of Anderson's U-2 was by the \"Cuban military at the direction of Raul Castro\".[132][133][134][135]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)President Kennedy and Secretary of Defense McNamara in an EXCOMM meeting, October 29, 1962\nThe EXCOMM then discussed the effect on the strategic balance of power, both political and military. The Joint Chiefs of Staff believed that the missiles would seriously alter the military balance, but McNamara disagreed. An extra 40, he reasoned, would make little difference to the overall strategic balance. The US already had approximately 5,000 strategic warheads,[84]: 261 but the Soviet Union had only 300. McNamara concluded that the Soviets having 340 would not therefore substantially alter the strategic balance. In 1990, he reiterated that \"it made *no* difference.... The military balance wasn't changed. I didn't believe it then, and I don't believe it now.\"[85]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCastro was forced to give way and, much to the relief of Khrushchev and the rest of the Soviet government, the tactical nuclear weapons were crated and returned by sea to the Soviet Union during December 1962.[206]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Soviet ship unloading a missile in the 1969 spy movie *Topaz*\nThe American popular media, especially television, made frequent use of the events of the missile crisis in both fictional and documentary forms.[207] Jim Willis includes the Crisis as one of the 100 \"media moments that changed America\".[208] Sheldon Stern finds that a half century later there are still many \"misconceptions, half-truths, and outright lies\" that have shaped media versions of what happened in the White House during those harrowing two weeks.[209]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)A US Navy HSS-1 Seabat helicopter hovers over Soviet submarine *B-59*, driven to the surface by US Naval forces in the Caribbean near Cuba (October 28 or 29, 1962).\nOn October 27, Khrushchev also received a letter from Castro, what is now known as the Armageddon Letter (dated the day before), which was interpreted as urging the use of nuclear force in the event of an attack on Cuba:[143] \"I believe the imperialists' aggressiveness is extremely dangerous and if they actually carry out the brutal act of invading Cuba in violation of international law and morality, that would be the moment to eliminate such danger forever through an act of clear legitimate defense, however harsh and terrible the solution would be,\" Castro wrote.[144]\n\n\n\n### Averted nuclear launch[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of nuclear close calls § 27 October 1962\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDespite almost solid opposition from his senior advisers, Kennedy quickly embraced the Soviet offer. \"This is a pretty good play of his,\" Kennedy said, according to a tape recording that he made secretly of the Cabinet Room meeting. Kennedy had deployed the Jupiters in March 1962, causing a stream of angry outbursts from Khrushchev. \"Most people will think this is a rather even trade and we ought to take advantage of it,\" Kennedy said. Vice President Lyndon Johnson was the first to endorse the missile swap but others continued to oppose the offer. Finally, Kennedy ended the debate. \"We can't very well invade Cuba with all its toil and blood,\" Kennedy said, \"when we could have gotten them out by making a deal on the same missiles on Turkey. If that's part of the record, then you don't have a very good war.\"[165]\n\n\nKennedy immediately responded to Khrushchev's letter, issuing a statement calling it \"an important and constructive contribution to peace\".[164] He continued this with a formal letter:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nKennedy concluded that attacking Cuba by air would signal the Soviets to presume \"a clear line\" to conquer Berlin. Kennedy also believed that US allies would think of the country as \"trigger-happy cowboys\" who lost Berlin because they could not peacefully resolve the Cuban situation.[83]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Soviet leadership believed, based on its perception of Kennedy's lack of confidence during the Bay of Pigs Invasion, that he would avoid confrontation and accept the missiles as a *fait accompli*.[19]: 1 On September 11, the Soviet Union publicly warned that a US attack on Cuba or on Soviet ships that were carrying supplies to the island would mean war.[17] The Soviets continued the *Maskirovka* program to conceal their actions in Cuba. They repeatedly denied that the weapons being brought into Cuba were offensive in nature. On September 7, Soviet Ambassador to the United States Anatoly Dobrynin assured United States Ambassador to the United Nations Adlai Stevenson that the Soviet Union was supplying only defensive weapons to Cuba. On September 11, the Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union (TASS: *Telegrafnoe Agentstvo Sovetskogo Soyuza*) announced that the Soviet Union had no need or intention to introduce offensive nuclear missiles into Cuba. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWith important Congressional elections scheduled for November, the crisis became enmeshed in American politics. On August 31, Senator Kenneth Keating (R-New York) warned on the Senate floor that the Soviet Union was \"in all probability\" constructing a missile base in Cuba. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThat evening, the CIA notified the Department of State and at 8:30 pm EDT, Bundy chose to wait until the next morning to tell the President. McNamara was briefed at midnight. The next morning, Bundy met with Kennedy and showed him the U-2 photographs and briefed him on the CIA's analysis of the images.[75] At 6:30 pm EDT, Kennedy convened a meeting of the nine members of the National Security Council and five other key advisers,[76] in a group he formally named the Executive Committee of the National Security Council (EXCOMM) after the fact on October 22 by National Security Action Memorandum 196.[77] Without informing the members of EXCOMM, President Kennedy tape-recorded all of their proceedings, and Sheldon M. Stern, head of the Kennedy library transcribed some of them.[78][79]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn October 13, Dobrynin was questioned by former Undersecretary of State Chester Bowles about whether the Soviets planned to put offensive weapons in Cuba. He denied any such plans.[61] On October 17, Soviet embassy official Georgy Bolshakov brought President Kennedy a personal message from Khrushchev reassuring him that \"under no circumstances would surface-to-surface missiles be sent to Cuba.\"[61]: 494\n\n\n\n## Missiles reported[edit]\n\n\nThe missiles in Cuba allowed the Soviets to effectively target most of the Continental US. The planned arsenal was forty launchers. The Cuban populace readily noticed the arrival and deployment of the missiles and hundreds of reports reached Miami. US intelligence received countless reports, many of dubious quality or even laughable, most of which could be dismissed as describing defensive missiles.[63][64][65]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWith this background, when Khrushchev heard Kennedy's threats relayed by Robert Kennedy to Soviet Ambassador Dobrynin, he immediately drafted his acceptance of Kennedy's latest terms from his dacha without involving the Politburo, as he had previously, and had them immediately broadcast over Radio Moscow, which he believed the US would hear. In that broadcast at 9:00 am EST, on October 28, Khrushchev stated that \"the Soviet government, in addition to previously issued instructions on the cessation of further work at the building sites for the weapons, has issued a new order on the dismantling of the weapons which you describe as 'offensive' and their crating and return to the Soviet Union.\"[162][163][164] At 10:00 am, October 28, Kennedy first learned of Khrushchev's solution to the crisis with the US removing the 15 Jupiters in Turkey and the Soviets would remove the rockets from Cuba. Khrushchev had made the offer in a public statement for the world to hear. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n> I consider my letter to you of October twenty-seventh and your reply of today as firm undertakings on the part of both our governments which should be promptly carried out.... The US will make a statement in the framework of the Security Council in reference to Cuba as follows: it will declare that the United States of America will respect the inviolability of Cuban borders, its sovereignty, that it take the pledge not to interfere in internal affairs, not to intrude themselves and not to permit our territory to be used as a bridgehead for the invasion of Cuba, and will restrain those who would plan to carry an aggression against Cuba, either from US territory or from the territory of other countries neighboring to Cuba.[164][166]: 103\n> \n> \n\n\nKennedy's planned statement would also contain suggestions he had received from his adviser Schlesinger Jr. in a \"Memorandum for the President\" describing the \"Post Mortem on Cuba\".[167]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter consultation with EXCOMM, Kennedy ordered a naval \"quarantine\" on October 22 to prevent further missiles from reaching Cuba.[5] By using the term \"quarantine\", rather than \"blockade\" (an act of war by legal definition), the United States was able to avoid the implications of a state of war.[6] The US announced it would not permit offensive weapons to be delivered to Cuba and demanded that the weapons already in Cuba be dismantled and returned to the Soviet Union.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMcNamara noted that another tanker, the *Grozny*, was about 600 miles (970 km) out and should be intercepted. He also noted that they had not made the Soviets aware of the blockade line and suggested relaying that information to them via U Thant at the United Nations.[130]\n\n\n\n![](image)A Lockheed U-2F, the high altitude reconnaissance type shot down over Cuba, being refueled by a Boeing KC-135Q.

The message stated, in part:\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nU-2 pilot Anderson's body was returned to the US and was buried with full military honours in South Carolina. He was the first recipient of the newly created Air Force Cross, which was awarded posthumously. Although Anderson was the only combatant fatality during the crisis, 11 crew members of three reconnaissance Boeing RB-47 Stratojets of the 55th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing were also killed in crashes during the period between September 27 and November 11, 1962.[199] Seven crew died when a Military Air Transport Service Boeing C-135B Stratolifter delivering ammunition to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base stalled and crashed on approach on October 23.[200]\n\n\n\n## Later revelations[edit]\n\n\n### Submarine close call[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *Mad Men*, the 2008 episode \"Meditations in an Emergency\" is set in the midst of the Cuban Missile Crisis.\n* *Ur*, a 2009 short novel by Stephen King, is about three men who discover through a magic Kindle that in a parallel universe, the Cuban Missile Crisis escalated into a nuclear war and ended that universe.[218]\n* *Call of Duty: Black Ops*, 2010 video game, set during and after the Cuban Missile Crisis.[219]\n* *The Kennedys*, 2011 production chronicling the lives of the Kennedy family, including a dramatisation of the crisis.[220]\n* *X-Men: First Class*, 2011 superhero film set during the Cuban Missile Crisis, which depicts the crisis as being escalated by a group of mutants with the goal of establishing a mutant ruling class after the subsequent war.[221]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the speech, a directive went out to all US forces worldwide, placing them on DEFCON 3. The heavy cruiser USS *Newport News* was the designated flagship for the blockade,[94] with USS *Leary* as *Newport News*'s destroyer escort.[95] Kennedy's speech writer Ted Sorensen stated in 2007 that the address to the nation was \"Kennedy's most important speech historically, in terms of its impact on our planet.\"[102]\n\n\n\n### Crisis deepens[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBBC journalist Joe Matthews published the story, on October 13, 2012, behind the 100 tactical nuclear warheads mentioned by Graham Allison in the excerpt above.[206] Khrushchev feared that Castro's hurt pride and widespread Cuban indignation over the concessions he had made to Kennedy might lead to a breakdown of the agreement between the Soviet Union and the United States. To prevent that, Khrushchev decided to offer to give Cuba more than 100 tactical nuclear weapons that had been shipped to Cuba along with the long-range missiles but, crucially, had escaped the notice of US intelligence. Khrushchev determined that because the Americans had not listed the missiles on their list of demands, keeping them in Cuba would be in the Soviet Union's interests.[206]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* *Thirteen Days*, Robert F.

Khrushchev went to Kennedy as he thought that the crisis was getting out of hand, but the Soviets were seen as retreating from circumstances that they had started.\n\n\nKhrushchev's fall from power two years later was in part because of the Soviet Politburo's embarrassment at both Khrushchev's eventual concessions to the US and this ineptitude in precipitating the crisis in the first place. According to Dobrynin, the top Soviet leadership took the Cuban outcome as \"a blow to its prestige bordering on humiliation\".[7]\n\n\n\n### US leadership[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn May 1962, Soviet First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev was persuaded by the idea of countering the US's growing lead in developing and deploying strategic missiles by placing Soviet intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Cuba, despite the misgivings of the Soviet Ambassador in Havana, Alexandr Ivanovich Alexeyev, who argued that Castro would not accept the deployment of the missiles.[38] Khrushchev faced a strategic situation in which the US was perceived to have a \"splendid first strike\" capability that put the Soviet Union at a huge disadvantage. In 1962, the Soviets had only 20 ICBMs capable of delivering nuclear warheads to the US from inside the Soviet Union.[39] The poor accuracy and reliability of the missiles raised serious doubts about their effectiveness. A newer, more reliable generation of ICBMs would become operational only after 1965.[39]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt 9:00 am EDT on October 27, Radio Moscow began broadcasting a message from Khrushchev. Contrary to the letter of the night before, the message offered a new trade: the missiles on Cuba would be removed in exchange for the removal of the Jupiter missiles from Italy and Turkey. At 10:00 am EDT, the executive committee met again to discuss the situation and came to the conclusion that the change in the message was because of internal debate between Khrushchev and other party officials in the Kremlin.[128]: 300 Kennedy realised that he would be in an \"insupportable position if this becomes Khrushchev's proposal\" because the missiles in Turkey were not militarily useful and were being removed anyway and \"It's gonna – to any man at the United Nations or any other rational man, it will look like a very fair trade.\" Bundy explained why Khrushchev's public acquiescence could not be considered: \"The current threat to peace is not in Turkey, it is in Cuba.\"[129]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn December 1959, under the Eisenhower administration and less than twelve months after the Cuban Revolution, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) developed a plan for paramilitary action against Cuba. The CIA recruited operatives on the island to carry out terrorism and sabotage, kill civilians, and cause economic damage.[18] At the initiative of the CIA Deputy Director for Plans, Richard Bissell, and approved by the new President John F. Kennedy, the US launched the attempted Bay of Pigs Invasion of Cuba in April 1961. It used CIA-trained forces of Cuban expatriates. The complete failure of the invasion, and the exposure of the US government role before the operation began, was a source of diplomatic embarrassment for the administration. Afterward, former President Eisenhower told Kennedy that \"the failure of the Bay of Pigs will embolden the Soviets to do something that they would otherwise not do.\"[19]: 10\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n175. **^** Nash, Philip (October 27, 1997). \"Chapter 6: A Very Tidy Job - Taking Them Out 1962 - 1963.\". *The Other Missiles of October: Eisenhower, Kennedy and the Jupiters 1957 - 1963* (PDF).

The US first obtained U-2 photographic evidence of the missiles on October 14, when a U-2 flight piloted by Major Richard Heyser took 928 pictures on a path selected by DIA analysts, capturing images of what turned out to be an SS-4 construction site at San Cristóbal, Pinar del Río Province (now in Artemisa Province), in western Cuba.[73]\n\n\n\n![](image)One of the first U-2 reconnaissance images of missile bases under construction shown to President Kennedy on the morning of October 16, 1962\n### President notified[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The nuclear-armed Jupiter intermediate-range ballistic missile. The US secretly agreed to withdraw the missiles from Italy and Turkey.\n### Cuban leadership[edit]\n\n\nCuba perceived the outcome as a betrayal by the Soviets, as decisions on how to resolve the crisis had been made exclusively by Kennedy and Khrushchev. Castro was especially upset that certain issues of interest to Cuba, such as the status of the US Naval Base in Guantánamo, were not addressed. That caused Cuban–Soviet relations to deteriorate for years to come.[46]: 278\n\n\nHistorian Arthur Schlesinger believed that when the missiles were withdrawn, Castro was more angry with Khrushchev than with Kennedy because Khrushchev had not consulted Castro before deciding to remove them.[note 2] Although Castro was infuriated by Khrushchev, he planned on striking the US with the remaining missiles if an invasion of the island occurred.[46]: 311\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Soviet First Secretary Khrushchev's letter to Kennedy (dated October 24, 1962) stating that the blockade of Cuba \"constitute[s] an act of aggression\"[103][104]\nOn October 24, at 11:24 am EDT, a cable, drafted by George Wildman Ball to the US Ambassador in Turkey and NATO, notified them that they were considering making an offer to withdraw the missiles from Italy and Turkey, in exchange for the Soviet withdrawal from Cuba. Turkish officials replied that they would \"deeply resent\" any trade involving the US missile presence in their country.[105] One day later, on the morning of October 25, American journalist Walter Lippmann proposed the same thing in his syndicated column. Castro reaffirmed Cuba's right to self-defense and said that all of its weapons were defensive and Cuba would not allow an inspection.[17]\n\n\n\n### International response[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAnastas Mikoyan was tasked with the negotiations with Castro over the missile transfer deal that was designed to prevent a breakdown in the relations between Cuba and the Soviet Union. While in Havana, Mikoyan witnessed the mood swings and paranoia of Castro, who was convinced that Moscow had made the agreement with the US at the expense of Cuba's defence. Mikoyan, on his own initiative, decided that Castro and his military should not be given control of weapons with an explosive force equal to 100 Hiroshima-sized bombs under any circumstances. He defused the seemingly intractable situation, which risked re-escalating the crisis, on November 22, 1962. During a tense, four-hour meeting, Mikoyan convinced Castro that despite Moscow's desire to help, it would be in breach of an unpublished Soviet law, which did not actually exist, to transfer the missiles permanently into Cuban hands and provide them with an independent nuclear deterrent. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nKhrushchev invited Norman Cousins, the editor of a major US periodical and an anti-nuclear weapons activist, to serve as liaison with President Kennedy, and Cousins met with Khrushchev for four hours in December 1962.[187]\n\n\nKennedy's response to Khrushchev's proposals was lukewarm but Kennedy expressed to Cousins that he felt constrained in exploring these issues due to pressure from hardliners in the US national security apparatus. The United States and the Soviet Union did shortly thereafter agree on a treaty banning atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons, known as the \"Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty\".[188]\n\n\nFurther after the crisis, the US and the USSR created the Moscow–Washington hotline, a direct communications link between Moscow and Washington. The purpose was to have a way that the leaders of the two Cold War countries could communicate directly to solve such a crisis.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWithin the US establishment, it was well understood that ignoring the second offer and returning to the first put Khrushchev in a terrible position. Military preparations continued, and all active duty Air Force personnel were recalled to their bases for possible action. Robert Kennedy later recalled the mood: \"We had not abandoned all hope, but what hope there was now rested with Khrushchev's revising his course within the next few hours. It was a hope, not an expectation. The expectation was military confrontation by Tuesday (October 30), and possibly tomorrow (October 29) ....\"[140]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA second reason that Soviet missiles were deployed to Cuba was that Khrushchev wanted to bring West Berlin, controlled by the American, British and French within Communist East Germany, into the Soviet orbit. The East Germans and Soviets considered western control over a portion of Berlin a grave threat to East Germany. Khrushchev made West Berlin the central battlefield of the Cold War. Khrushchev believed that if the US did nothing over the missile deployments in Cuba, he could muscle the West out of Berlin using said missiles as a deterrent to western countermeasures in Berlin. If the US tried to bargain with the Soviets after it became aware of the missiles, Khrushchev could demand trading the missiles for West Berlin. Since Berlin was strategically more important than Cuba, the trade would be a win for Khrushchev, as Kennedy recognized: \"The advantage is, from Khrushchev's point of view, he takes a great chance but there are quite some rewards to it.\"[41]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter several days of tense negotiations, an agreement was reached between Kennedy and Khrushchev: publicly, the Soviets would dismantle their offensive weapons in Cuba and return them to the Soviet Union, subject to United Nations verification, in exchange for a US public declaration and agreement to not invade Cuba again. Secretly, the United States agreed with the Soviets that it would dismantle all of the Jupiter MRBMs which had been deployed to Turkey against the Soviet Union. There has been debate on whether Italy was included in the agreement as well. While the Soviets dismantled their missiles, some Soviet bombers remained in Cuba, and the United States kept the naval quarantine in place until November 20, 1962.[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Removal of Missiles in Cuba November 11, 1962 – NARA – 193868\nThe US continued the blockade; in the following days, aerial reconnaissance proved that the Soviets were making progress in removing the missile systems. The 42 missiles and their support equipment were loaded onto eight Soviet ships. On November 2, 1962, Kennedy addressed the US via radio and television broadcasts regarding the dismantlement process of the Soviet R-12 missile bases located in the Caribbean region.[170] The ships left Cuba on November 5 to 9. The US made a final visual check as each of the ships passed the blockade line. Further diplomatic efforts were required to remove the Soviet Il-28 bombers, and they were loaded on three Soviet ships on December 5 and 6. Concurrent with the Soviet commitment on the Il-28s, the US government announced the end of the blockade from 6:45 pm EST on November 20, 1962.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. **^** Bolender, Keith (2012). *Cuba under Siege: American Policy, the Revolution, and its People*.

The economic inequality and social unrest was brought to a head under the brutal Batista dictatorship, supported by American arms, money, and authority. An estimated 20,000 were killed opposing the government from 1955 to his overthrow, with even President John F. Kennedy using this figure in a rare expression of sympathy for revolutionary goals. Kennedy also came closest to recognizing America could not claim ignorance of the harm its neocolonial control was inflicting on the inhabitants...Transformation came swiftly, completely, and often framed in direct conflict with American immoderations. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe compromise embarrassed Khrushchev and the Soviet Union because the withdrawal of US missiles from Italy and Turkey was a secret deal between Kennedy and Khrushchev, and the Soviets were seen as retreating from circumstances that they had started. Khrushchev's fall from power two years later was in part because of the Soviet Politburo's embarrassment at both Khrushchev's eventual concessions to the US and his ineptitude in precipitating the crisis in the first place.

All ships of any kind bound for Cuba, from whatever nation or port, will, if found to contain cargoes of offensive weapons, be turned back. This quarantine will be extended, if needed, to other types of cargo and carriers. We are not at this time, however, denying the necessities of life as the Soviets attempted to do in their Berlin blockade of 1948.[101]\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1961, the US government put Jupiter nuclear missiles in Italy and Turkey. It had also trained a paramilitary force of Cuban exiles, which the CIA led in an attempt to invade Cuba and overthrow its government. Starting in November of that year, the US government engaged in a violent campaign of terrorism and sabotage in Cuba, referred to as the Cuban Project, which continued throughout the first half of the 1960s. The Soviet administration was concerned about a Cuban drift towards China, with which the Soviets had an increasingly fractious relationship. In response to these factors, Soviet First Secretary, Nikita Khrushchev, agreed with the Cuban Prime Minister, Fidel Castro, to place nuclear missiles on the island of Cuba to deter a future invasion. An agreement was reached during a secret meeting between Khrushchev and Castro in July 1962, and construction of a number of missile launch facilities started later that summer.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOf that group, those who lived past the 1960s and 1970s—Bundy, Rusk, Sorensen and McNamara, for example—kept the secret for years, not fully acknowledging the official status of the deal until 1989, when former Soviet ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin disclosed the details of his October 27, 1962, meeting with Robert Kennedy.\n173. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Hershberg, Jim. \"Anatomy of a Controversy: Anatoly F.

The perception was that Kennedy had won the contest between the superpowers and that Khrushchev had been humiliated. Both Kennedy and Khrushchev took every step to avoid full conflict despite pressures from their respective governments. Khrushchev held power for another two years.[166]: 102–105 As a direct result to the crisis, the United States and the Soviet Union set up a direct line of communication. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRobert F. Kennedy described the letter as \"very long and emotional\". Khrushchev reiterated the basic outline that had been stated to Scali earlier in the day: \"I propose: we, for our part, will declare that our ships bound for Cuba are not carrying any armaments. You will declare that the United States will not invade Cuba with its troops and will not support any other forces which might intend to invade Cuba. Then the necessity of the presence of our military specialists in Cuba will disappear.\" At 6:45 pm EDT, news of Fomin's offer to Scali was finally heard and was interpreted as a \"set up\" for the arrival of Khrushchev's letter. The letter was then considered official and accurate, although it was later learned that Fomin was almost certainly operating of his own accord without official backing. Additional study of the letter was ordered and continued into the night.[105]\n\n\n\n### Crisis continues[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Belligerents |\n| ![](image) Soviet Union![](image) Cuba*Supported by:*![](image) Warsaw Pact (except Albania and Romania[1]) | ![](image) United States![](image) United Kingdom![](image) Italy![](image) Turkey*Supported by:*![](image) NATO (except France)![](image) OAS |\n| Commanders and leaders |\n| * ![Soviet Union](image) **Nikita Khrushchev**\n* ![Soviet Union](image) Anastas Mikoyan\n* ![Soviet Union](image) Rodion Malinovsky\n* ![Soviet Union](image) Matvei Zakharov\n* ![Soviet Union](image) Sergey Biryuzov\n* ![Soviet Union](image) Issa Pliyev\n* ![Soviet Union](image) Georgy Abashvili\n* ![Cuba](image) Fidel Castro\n* ![Cuba](image) Raúl Castro\n* ![Cuba](image) Che Guevara\n | * ![United States](image) **John F.

According to Khrushchev, the Soviet Union's motives were \"aimed at allowing Cuba to live peacefully and develop as its people desire\".[45]\n\n\nSchlesinger, a historian and adviser to Kennedy, told National Public Radio in an interview on October 16, 2002, that Castro did not want the missiles, but Khrushchev pressured Castro to accept them. Castro was not completely happy with the idea, but the Cuban National Directorate of the Revolution accepted them, both to protect Cuba against US attack and to aid the Soviet Union.[46]: 272\n\n\n\n### Soviet military deployments[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFor the only confirmed time in US history, B-52 bombers went on continuous airborne alert, and B-47 medium bombers were dispersed to various military and civilian airfields and made ready to take off, fully equipped, on 15 minutes' notice.[112] One-eighth of SAC's 1,436 bombers were on airborne alert, and some 145 intercontinental ballistic missiles stood on ready alert, some of which targeted Cuba.[113] Air Defense Command (ADC) redeployed 161 nuclear-armed interceptors to 16 dispersal fields within nine hours, with one third maintaining 15-minute alert status.[90] Twenty-three nuclear-armed B-52s were sent to orbit points within striking distance of the Soviet Union so it would believe that the US was serious.[114] Jack J. Catton later estimated that about 80 per cent of SAC's planes were ready for launch during the crisis; David A. Burchinal recalled that, by contrast:[115]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *The Armageddon Letters*, a transmedia storytelling of the crisis with animated short films and other digital content\n* *The Man Who Saved the World* Documentary produced by PBS Series *Secrets of the Dead*\n* Cuban Missile Crisis (1962) collected news and commentary at *The New York Times*\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nRobert F.

It was the possibility of military action that played an influential role in accelerating Khrushchev's proposal for a compromise.[120] Throughout the closing stages of October, Soviet communications to the United States indicated increasing defensiveness. Khrushchev's increasing tendency to use poorly phrased and ambiguous communications throughout the compromise negotiations conversely increased United States confidence and clarity in messaging. Leading Soviet figures consistently failed to mention that only the Cuban government could agree to inspections of the territory and continually made arrangements relating to Cuba without the knowledge of Fidel Castro himself. According to Dean Rusk, Khrushchev \"blinked\"; he began to panic from the consequences of his own plan, and this was reflected in the tone of Soviet messages. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *A Nation of Immigrants* (1958)\n |\n| Death | * Assassination\n\t+ timeline\n\t+ media coverage\n\t+ reactions\n\t+ in popular culture\n* State funeral\n\t+ Riderless horse\n\t+ attending dignitaries\n* Gravesite and Eternal Flame\n |\n| Legacy | * Bibliography\n* John F.

For the US, around 3,500 (with a combined yield of approximately 6,300 megatons) would have been used in attacking the Soviet Union. The Soviets had considerably less strategic firepower at their disposal: some 300–320 bombs and warheads, without submarine-based weapons in a position to threaten the US mainland and most of their intercontinental delivery systems based on bombers that would have difficulty penetrating North American air defence systems. However, they had already moved 158 warheads to Cuba; between 95 and 100 would have been ready for use if the US had invaded Cuba, most of which were short-ranged. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ Cuban Pacification Medal (Army)\n* Banana Wars\n\t+ Negro Rebellion\n\t+ Sugar Intervention\n* Cuban Revolution\n\t+ Aftermath\n\t+ La Coubre explosion\n\t+ Cuban exodus\n\t+ Cuban exile\n\t+ Golden exile\n* Bay of Pigs Invasion\n\t+ Brigade 2506\n\t+ Cuban Democratic Revolutionary Front\n\t+ Cuban Revolutionary Council\n\t+ Operation 40\n\t+ Operation Mongoose\n\t+ Operation Northwoods\n\t+ Operation Ortsac\n\t+ Operation Peter Pan\n\t+ JMWAVE\n\t+ Polita Grau\n\t+ José Antonio Llama\n\t+ Bay of Pigs Monument\n\t+ Bay of Pigs Museum\n* Jamaican political conflict\n* United States invasion of Grenada\n* United States embargo against Cuba\n |\n| Incidents | * Cubana de Aviación Flight 493\n* Matthew Edward Duke\n* Cuban Missile Crisis\n\t+ Crateology\n* Banco Nacional de Cuba v.

This identification was made, in part, on the strength of reporting provided by Oleg Penkovsky, a double agent in the GRU working for the CIA and MI6. Although he provided no direct reports of the Soviet missile deployments to Cuba, technical and doctrinal details of Soviet missile regiments that had been provided by Penkovsky in the months and years prior to the Crisis helped NPIC analysts correctly identify the missiles on U-2 imagery.[74]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_pVwctLCicF6MuJWatLEEOCCY","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
