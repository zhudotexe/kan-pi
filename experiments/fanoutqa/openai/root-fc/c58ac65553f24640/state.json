Unlike her predecessors, she is viewed as more of an academic economist than a traditional politician used to horse-trading and dealmaking, qualities that could be critical to achieving the goals of Biden's economic agenda in a deeply partisan Congress.[125][126][127] All living former U.S. treasury secretaries, from George Shultz to Jack Lew, endorsed Yellen for the position in a bipartisan letter calling on the Senate to swiftly confirm her.[128]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | University of Michigan | Doctor of Laws (LL.D.)[207] | No\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Pennsylvania\n | May 17, 2021\n | University of Pennsylvania | Doctor of Laws (LL.D.)[208] | No\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | This list is incomplete; you can help by adding missing items. *(May 2021)*\n |\n\n\n### Memberships and fellowships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n208. **^** \"Chronological Listing of Honorary Degree Recipients\" (PDF). *secretary.upenn.edu*.

Kamala Harris, on economic issues.[113] The meeting was one of the first times the Biden campaign announced its economic expert, whom few at the time predicted would take a presidential cabinet post.[114]\n\n\nBetween 2018 and 2020, Yellen received over $7\u00a0million in speaking fees from financial companies such as Barclays, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and the hedge fund Citadel after leaving the Federal Reserve.[115][116][117] With her return to government, she pledged to get official permission from the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) to participate in substantive issues involving such firms to avoid any conflict of interest.[118][117]\n\n\n\n## Secretary of the Treasury (2021\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\n### Nomination and confirmation[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Official photo as CEA chair, c.\u20091990s\nOn December 20, 1996, Yellen joined the Clinton administration as chair of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), replacing Joseph Stiglitz in office.[41] She was reluctant to leave the Federal Reserve, but White House officials talked her into a job, passing over others with greater marquee value because, as Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said, \"We wanted someone who could bring a rigorous analytic approach to the issues and who could work well with others.\"[42] Yellen was unanimously confirmed by the Senate on February 13, 1997,[43] thereby becoming the second woman to serve as chief economic advisor to the president after Laura Tyson.[44][42] While serving within the Administration, she concurrently chaired the OECD Economic Policy Committee from 1997 to 1999.[25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n5. **^** Kornbluh, Jacob (January 18, 2021). \"Enough for a minyan: A Jewish Who's Who of Biden's Cabinet-to-Be\". *The Forward*.

Austin and Beau kept in touch with each other after Beau returned from his deployment.[55][56] Biden became acquainted with Austin while Austin was CENTCOM commander in the Obama administration, and reportedly grew to trust Austin after receiving Austin's briefings.[57] Like former defense secretary James Mattis,[58] Austin required a congressional waiver of the National Security Act of 1947 to bypass the seven-year waiting period after leaving active-duty military, as prescribed by 10\u00a0U.S.C.\u00a0\u00a7\u00a0113(a), in order to be appointed as Secretary of Defense.[57] Austin's nomination, and the attendant requirement for a waiver, met with some concern in Congress regarding its implications for civil\u2013military relations.[59][60] Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and former Secretary of State Colin Powell, among others, issued statements supporting Austin's nomination.[61]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Secretary of Veterans Affairs | * Denis McDonough (2021\u2013present)\n |\n| Secretary of Homeland Security | * Alejandro Mayorkas (2021\u2013present)\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n51. **^** \"Nucor Announces the Addition of General Lloyd J.

Many of those removed were last minute political appointees after the 2020 election.[76]\n\n\n\n### Extremism in the ranks[edit]\n\n\nConcerns of possible right-wing extremism among the troops caused Austin to implement new training requirements. On February 5, 2021, Austin announced that all members of the United States military would be required to stand down within the next 60 days in order to conduct training. The training includes the importance of the oath of office, a review of impermissible behaviors, and procedures for reporting suspected or actual extremist behavior.[77][78][79]\n\n\n\n![](image)Austin meets with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv, Israel, March 9, 2023\n### Middle East[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Senate Armed Services Committee held a confirmation hearing for Austin on January 19, 2021.[62] On January 21, Congress granted Austin a waiver of the seven-year requirement by a 326\u201378 vote in the House and a 69\u201327 vote in the Senate.[63][64] He was confirmed by the Senate in a 93\u20132 vote on January 22, 2021.[65] Republican senators Josh Hawley and Mike Lee were the only \"no\" votes.

It also called for replacing the Department of Energy with a new Department of Energy Security, to oversee and redefine the federal government's role in energy policy. The reorganized department would have acted as an institutional advocate for innovation in energy policy and was intended to ensure accountability as the nation works towards achieving its energy security goals. Through this new department, America's overriding objective in energy policy would have been to make America the unquestioned leader in clean energy, enhancing national security and economic strength.[27]\n\n\nIn a 2007 lecture to the Commonwealth Club of California, Vilsack stated:[28]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn November 30, 2006, he formally launched his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination in the 2008 election, but ended his bid on February 23, 2007.[1] President-elect Barack Obama announced Vilsack's selection to be Secretary of Agriculture on December 17, 2008. His nomination was confirmed by the United States Senate by unanimous consent on January 20, 2009. Until his January 13, 2017 resignation[2] one week prior to the end of Obama's second term as president, he had been the only member of the U.S. Cabinet who had served since the day Obama originally took office. As of the end of that term[update] he was the fourth-longest-serving holder of the office.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Vilsack's 2009 official portrait during his first tenure as Agriculture secretary\n![](image)Vilsack introduces President Barack Obama at the Northeast Iowa Community College, for a White House Rural Economic Forum on August 16, 2011.\nOn December 17, 2008, then-President-elect Barack Obama announced his choice of Vilsack as the nominee to be the 30th Secretary of Agriculture.[29] Vilsack has governed a largely agricultural state as did the previous two Secretaries of Agriculture, Mike Johanns (who was later a United States Senator from Nebraska) (2005\u20132007) and Ed Schafer (2007\u20132009).\n\n\nThe Senate confirmed Vilsack's nomination for the position by unanimous consent on January 20, 2009.[30]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n47. **^** \"Tom Vilsack Is the Wrong Person To Lead the Department of Agriculture\". *Reason.com*.

The edited tape had been posted online by conservative blogger Andrew Breitbart.[35] Vilsack expressed his \"deep regret\" to Sherrod in acting hastily.[36]\n\n\nOn January 24, 2012, Obama appointed Vilsack the designated survivor during the President's State of the Union address.[37]\n\n\n\n### Beef advocacy[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Vilsack's campaign logo\nVilsack's campaign made significant use of social media by maintaining an active MySpace profile, a collection of viral video clips on YouTube, a Facebook profile, videoblog on blip.tv,[21] and a conference call with the podcast site TalkShoe.[22] On January 27, 2007, Vilsack called into the Regular Guys Show hosted by Kurt Hurner to conduct a 15\u2011minute interview on his running for the Democratic nomination for 2008. Since then, Vilsack appeared again on the show, now The Kurt Hurner Show at Talk Shoe on August 12, 2008, this time as a supporter of Barack Obama for president taking questions from callers to the program for 30 minutes.\n\n\nDuring the campaign, Vilsack joined fellow candidates Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden in supporting the establishment of a U.S. Public Service Academy as a civilian counterpart to the military academies.[23]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nVilsack is a former member of the National Governors Association Executive Committee. He was chair of the Democratic Governors Association in 2004. He was also chair of the Governors Biotechnology Partnership, the Governors Ethanol Coalition, and the Midwest Governors Conference, and has also been chair and vice-chair of the National Governors Association's committee on Natural Resources, where he worked to develop the NGA's farm and energy policies.[18]\n\n\nVilsack was thought to be high on the list of potential running mates for Kerry in the 2004 presidential election.[19] In 2005, Vilsack established Heartland PAC, a political action committee aimed at electing Democratic governors. In the first report, he raised over half a million dollars.

Though first seen as a likely Secretary of Health and Human Services, Raimondo announced on December 3, 2020, that she would not be taking that role.[82] She was also considered for Secretary of the Treasury.[83][84]\n\n\nOn January 7, 2021, Biden announced he would nominate Raimondo to serve as Secretary of Commerce.[85] She appeared before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation on January 26.[86] On March 1, the Senate voted 84\u201315 in favor of cloture on the nomination, and confirmed Raimondo to the position the following day by a vote of 84\u201315.[87]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Gina Raimondo\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Official portrait, 2021\n |\n|  |\n| 40th United States Secretary of Commerce |\n| **Incumbent**\n |\n| **Assumed office** March 3, 2021 |\n| President | Joe Biden |\n| Deputy | Don Graves |\n| Preceded by | Wilbur Ross |\n| 75th Governor of Rhode Island |\n| **In office**January 6, 2015\u00a0\u2013 March 2, 2021 |\n| Lieutenant | Dan McKee |\n| Preceded by | Lincoln Chafee |\n| Succeeded by | Dan McKee |\n| 30th General Treasurer of Rhode Island |\n| **In office**January 4, 2011\u00a0\u2013 January 6, 2015 |\n| Governor | Lincoln Chafee |\n| Preceded by | Frank Caprio |\n| Succeeded by | Seth Magaziner |\n|  |\n| Personal details |\n| Born | Gina Marie Raimondo\n (1971-05-17) May 17, 1971 (age\u00a053)Smithfield, Rhode Island, U.S. |\n| Political party | Democratic |\n| Spouse | \nAndrew Moffit\n \u200b\n(m.\u00a02001)\u200b\n |\n| Children | 2 |\n| Education | Harvard College (AB)New College, Oxford (MA, DPhil)Yale University (JD) |\n| Occupation | Businesswoman, politician, venture capitalist |\n| Profession | Lawyer |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGina Marie Raimondo was born in 1971[15] in Smithfield, Rhode Island, where she later grew up. Of Italian descent, she is the youngest of Josephine (Piro) and Joseph Raimondo's three children.[16][17] Her father, Joseph (1926\u20132014), made his career at the Bulova watch factory in Providence, Rhode Island; he became unemployed at 56 when the Bulova company moved its operations to China, shuttering the factory in Providence.[18] Raimondo is a childhood friend of U.S. Senator Jack Reed.[19]\n\n\nRaimondo graduated from LaSalle Academy in Providence. She was one of the first girls allowed to attend the Catholic school, from which she was graduated as valedictorian.[20][21] She went on to Harvard College, graduating *magna cum laude* in 1993 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics. While at Harvard, Raimondo resided in Quincy House and served on the staff of *The Harvard Crimson*. She played rugby at the Radcliffe Rugby Club, later joking that the experience \"was good training for a career in politics\".[22]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2014, Raimondo was elected governor in a three-way contest with 41% of the vote.[5] While in office, Raimondo was elected to serve as vice chair of the Democratic Governors Association (DGA) for the 2018 election cycle.[6] Reelected in 2018, Raimondo was tasked with overseeing the state's initial response to the COVID-19 pandemic.[7][8] In the 2020 presidential election, she served as co-chair of Michael Bloomberg's 2020 presidential campaign.[9]\n\n\nDescribed as a \"moderate technocrat\" by *The Washington Post*,[10] Raimondo is often characterized as a centrist within her party.[11][12][13] Chosen to serve as Secretary of Commerce by President Joe Biden,[1] she played a leading role in negotiations for the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act in 2021.[14]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPress secretary Jennifer Bogdan Jones of the Governor's Office told *The Providence Journal* that Raimondo \"is prepared to do whatever it takes to support Mike and defeat President Trump.\"[79] As campaign co-chair, Raimondo would have \"provided advice and attended events\". Less than a month later, Bloomberg dropped out of the race and endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden.[80] On the same day, Raimondo also endorsed Biden. She said Bloomberg \"obviously\" performed poorly on the debate stage but supporting his candidacy \"was an easy decision for me at the beginning. But [supporting Biden] is an easy decision, too.\" Raimondo concluded that it was now time \"to unify behind Joe Biden\".[81]\n\n\nIn May 2020, writer George Will wrote in favor of Raimondo being chosen as Biden's running mate in the 2020 election.[18] U.S. Senator Kamala Harris was chosen instead.\n\n\n\n## Secretary of Commerce (2021\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\n### Nomination[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn October 2018, the United States Department of Health and Human Services' Administration for Children and Families ordered the Raimondo administration DCYF to improve in 33 of 36 areas assessed.[74] The federal report noted that DCYF services were \"inadequate, not developed when needed, or lacked consistent monitoring\". Harvard Kennedy School professor and former Obama administration official Jeffrey Liebman agreed with the recommendations and analysis of the report from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and claimed that the DCYF is \"the most messed-up agency ever\".[75]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring Raimondo's tenure, the Department of Commerce sanctioned NSO Group for selling spyware technology.[90] As Secretary of Commerce, Raimondo has worked with other administration officials, such as Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, on coordinating cybersecurity policy.[91] In March 2021, Raimondo issued subpoenas for several China-based telecommunications firms, arguing that \"unrestricted use of untrusted ICTS poses a national security risk\".\n\n\nAs Secretary of Commerce, Raimondo has been a co-chair of the Trade and Technology Council since its creation in 2021.[92]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n77. **^** Sherman, Eli (December 12, 2019). \"Months later, still no director for DCYF\". *WPRI 12*.

She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Stanford University and a Juris Doctor from Harvard Law School.[13]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nSu started her legal career at the Asian-Pacific American Legal Center. She was a Litigation Director for Advancing Justice L.A., a non-profit civil rights organization.\n\n\nSu was the lead attorney for the El Monte Thai Garment Slavery Case.[14] As the lead for civil case brought by the El Monte garment workers, Su successfully pursued a legal theory that held manufacturers responsible for the wage theft, as well as the operators who actually kept the garment workers captive. She and other activists also petitioned for the workers to be able to stay in the United States under a visa program for those who cooperate with the government in criminal trials. This led to the creation of the T-Visa for victims of human trafficking.[15]\n\n\nDuring Jerry Brown's tenure as governor, Su headed California's Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE) as the California Labor Commissioner.[6] Under Governor Gavin Newsom, Su served as Secretary of the California Labor and Workforce Development Agency.[4]\n\n\n\n## United States Department of Labor[edit]\n\n\n### Deputy Secretary of Labor[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2020, Su was named as a potential candidate to serve as Secretary of Labor in the Biden administration.[16][17] Su's prospective nomination was pushed by AAPI political leaders and activists, including the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus (CAPAC).[18]\n\n\nConversely, she was opposed by business groups and congressional Republicans. Opponents criticized her leadership of California's unemployment agency during the COVID-19 pandemic,[19] when over a million legitimate applicants had their claims delayed or frozen,[4] while up to $31 billion was sent to fraudulent claimants (including to criminals belonging to national and international crime rings and inmates in the state's prison system).[20][21] Opposition also centered on her enforcement of California's controversial employment law, AB 5.[22][23]\n\n\nOn February 10, 2021, Su was nominated by President Biden to be the Deputy Secretary of Labor under Secretary Marty Walsh. Asian-American leaders, including members of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, had lobbied the Biden administration to appoint her as Deputy Secretary after she wasn't chosen to lead the department.[24]\n\n\nThe Senate HELP Committee held hearings on Su's nomination on March 16, 2021. The committee favorably reported her nomination to the Senate floor on April 21, 2021.[25] On July 13, 2021, Su was confirmed to the role by the Senate, in a 50\u201347 vote.[26]\n\n\n\n### Secretary of Labor nomination[edit]\n\n\nAfter it was reported in 2023 that Walsh would leave the role, Su was expected to serve as acting secretary of labor in his absence.[7][27] After Walsh's resignation announcement, members of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus called on Biden to nominate Su as Walsh's permanent successor, citing the lack of Asian-Americans in Biden's cabinet.[28] On February 28, 2023, President Joe Biden nominated Su to serve as the United States secretary of labor.[9]\n\n\nSu's nomination faced challenges on both sides of the aisle, due to the reluctance of Senator Joe Manchin to support her, as well as Republican criticism of her handling of covid unemployment relief funding in California, wherein an estimated $32 billion meant to safeguard unemployed Californians during the pandemic ended up being paid out fraudulently.[29][30] She is currently waiting on confirmation from the full Senate where the confirmation process has stalled due to a lack of votes necessary for confirmation. However, she remains the Acting Secretary of Labor in the interim.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nSu's support for California Assembly Bill 5 (2019) and the California FAST Recovery Act, two labor laws that have proven contentious, led to reason business interests criticizing her nomination.[31]\n\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\n* Skadden Fellowship\n* 2001 MacArthur Fellows Program\n* 1996 Reebok International Human Rights Award[32]\n\n\n## Works[edit]\n\n\n* \"Making the Invisible Visible: The Garment Industry's Dirty Laundry\" *University of Iowa Journal on Gender, Race & Justice* (winter 1997\u20131998)\n* \"Critical Coalitions,\" (with Eric Yamamoto) *Critical Race Theory: An Anthology*\n* \"Workers at the Crossfire: Immigration Enforcement to Preserve Capital,\" in *Unfinished Liberation* (Joy James, ed.

Times* reported in early December 2020 that Biden would nominate Becerra as Secretary of Health and Human Services.[75] His nomination to lead the Health and Human Services Department has been criticized by pro-life and conservative leaders led by Students for Life of America, citing his \"absence of health care experience and his disregard for people of faith\".[76][77] Becerra's nomination was deadlocked by the Senate's Finance Committee on March 10, 2021.[78] One day later, on March 11, 2021, Becerra's nomination was discharged from the Finance Committee by the entire Senate, in a vote of 51-48.[79] He was confirmed by the Senate in a vote of 50-49 on March 18, 2021, with all but one Democrat present and one Republican, Susan Collins, voting in favor.[80][81] This was the narrowest vote for any of Biden's cabinet positions. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn March 22, 2021, Becerra was sworn in to be the new secretary.[82]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Secretary Becerra with First Lady Jill Biden and Secretary of Veterans Affairs Denis McDonough, June 4, 2021\nSoon after officially becoming the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Becerra released a statement praising the Affordable Care Act and encouraging people to keep enrolling in its health care program.[83] Becerra also became Secretary during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, of which his cabinet department the U.S. Health and Human Services was mainly responsible for mitigating the pandemic's effects to the American public.

Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton for the vice presidential nomination in 2016.[44] Senator Tim Kaine was eventually chosen.\n\n\nDuring the presidential transition of Joe Biden in 2020, it was reported that Becerra was being considered for the Cabinet positions of Secretary of Homeland Security and Attorney General.[45]\n\n\n\n### 2020 U.S. Senate speculation[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2020, California Senator Kamala Harris was selected by presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden as his vice presidential running mate.

A member of the Democratic Party, she served as the U.S. representative for Ohio's 11th congressional district from 2008 to 2021. The district includes most of the black-majority precincts between Cleveland and Akron.\n\n\nFollowing the death of Stephanie Tubbs Jones in 2008, Fudge ran unopposed in the special election to replace her.[1] She was chair of the Congressional Black Caucus in the 113th Congress.[2] She considered running for Speaker of the United States House of Representatives at the start of the 116th Congress but eventually announced she would back Nancy Pelosi.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nOhio's delegation(s) to the 110th\u2013117th United States Congresses (ordered by seniority)\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **110th** | **Senate:** \u258cG.

This virtually assured her election in the heavily Democratic, black-majority district.[18][19] Fudge won the November\u00a04 general election, defeating Republican Thomas Pekarek with 85% of the vote.[20] She was unopposed in a November 18 special election for the balance of Jones's fifth term, and won with fewer than nine thousand votes cast.[21] She was sworn in on November 19, 2008, giving her almost two months' more seniority than the rest of the 2008 House freshman class.[22][23]\n\n\nAfter the 2018 midterms, Fudge considered running for Speaker of the House in the 2019 election. She later abandoned the bid and supported Nancy Pelosi.[24]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

However, she made clear early on that she was not interested, which was reported to have \"stunned\" senior Democrats, who were \"surprised and disappointed\" that Granholm had taken herself out of the running. U.S. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida was elected instead.[109]\n\n\nAfter President Obama was re-elected in 2012, Granholm was reportedly considered for a position in Obama's second-term Cabinet, specifically to succeed Chu as secretary of energy, Ray LaHood as U.S. secretary of transportation, Hilda Solis as U.S. secretary of labor or Eric Holder as U.S attorney general.[110][111][112][113][114] Granholm herself dampened such speculation, citing her sharp criticism of Republicans during the 2012 election and her time presenting on Current TV.[115]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGranholm was twice mentioned as a possible U.S. Secretary of Energy, first in December 2008 when President-elect Obama was assembling his first-term Cabinet[98] and again in December 2010, when it was rumoured that Secretary Steven Chu might resign.[99]\n\n\nGranholm was also twice considered by President Obama to be a potential Supreme Court candidate.[100][101][102][103][104][105] In May 2009, she was on the shortlist of candidates to replace the retiring Associate Justice David Souter.[106] She attended a CAFE standards meeting at the White House on May 19 and spoke with Obama, but officials would not comment on whether the two discussed a potential court appointment.[107] Obama chose Sonia Sotomayor, who was confirmed by the Senate in August. After the retirement of Associate Justice John Paul Stevens in May 2010, Granholm was again spoken of as a potential candidate;[108] Obama chose Elena Kagan, who was confirmed in August.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n119. **^** Matt Apuzzo & Michael D.

Granholm was mentioned as a candidate to succeed him,[116] but she announced shortly after that she would not run.[117] She endorsed U.S. Representative Gary Peters,[118] who defeated Republican nominee Terri Lynn Land in the general election.\n\n\nIn September 2014, when U.S Attorney General Eric Holder announced his intention to step down, there was speculation that Granholm might be a potential candidate to succeed him.[119] Loretta Lynch was ultimately nominated and confirmed for the position.\n\n\nThere was speculation that Granholm's increased visibility from her senior role in the Clinton campaign indicated that she would be under consideration for a position in the U.S. Cabinet or Democratic National Committee leadership if Clinton had won the 2016 election.[120]\n\n\n\n## Secretary of Energy (2021\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Granholm addressing troops returning to Michigan following a tour in Iraq, December 2005\nGranholm emphasized post-secondary education for Michiganders following the decline in Michigan manufacturing jobs, many of which did not require a college degree. In 2004 she asked Lieutenant Governor John D. Cherry to lead the Commission on Higher Education and Economic Growth to double the number of college graduates in Michigan. Many of the commission's recommendations were enacted into law during Granholm's tenure as governor, e.g. increasing high school graduation standards (The Michigan Merit Curriculum) so that every Michigan high school student takes a college preparatory curriculum, which includes four years of math and English/language arts and three years of science and social studies, beginning with students who entered high school in the fall of 2006.[42]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Jennifer Granholm\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Official portrait, 2021\n |\n|  |\n| 16th United States Secretary of Energy |\n| **Incumbent**\n |\n| **Assumed office** February 25, 2021 |\n| President | Joe Biden |\n| Deputy | David Turk |\n| Preceded by | Dan Brouillette |\n| 47th Governor of Michigan |\n| **In office**January 1, 2003\u00a0\u2013 January 1, 2011 |\n| Lieutenant | John D.

Eventually Obama chose Sonia Sotomayor.[74]\n\n\nIn 2010, Granholm was barred from seeking re-election due to Michigan's term limits law.[75] Her governorship ended on January 1, 2011, when Republican Rick Snyder, who won the 2010 election, was sworn in.\n\n\n\n## Subsequent career[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGranholm signed a detailed ethics agreement for the top energy government job and has since then, violated certain provisions of the STOCK Act.[134]\n\n\nOn December 16, 2022, Granholm cleared J.

A member of the Democratic Party, he was confirmed by the U.S. Senate by a vote of 64\u201333 on March 1, 2021.[1] Cardona previously served as commissioner of the Connecticut State Department of Education from 2019 to 2021.\n\n\nA native of Meriden, Connecticut, Cardona began his career as a fourth-grade teacher at Israel Putnam Elementary School in Meriden. In 2003, at the age of twenty-seven, he was named principal of Meriden's Hanover School, making him the youngest principal in the state.[2][3]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nCardona was born on July 11, 1975, in Meriden, Connecticut, to Puerto Rican parents.[4][5] Cardona grew up speaking Spanish as his first language and started to learn English when entering kindergarten.[6][7] His father is a retired police officer in Meriden.[8] Cardona was raised in a housing project in Meriden and graduated from the H.C. Wilcox Technical High School, where he was a part of the automotive studies program.[9][10][11]\n\n\nCardona earned a bachelor of science degree in education from Central Connecticut State University in 1997. He obtained a master of science in bilingual and bicultural education at University of Connecticut (UConn) in 2001. In 2004, he completed a professional sixth year certification at UConn where he earned a doctor of education in 2011.[12][13]\n\n\nCardona's dissertation, titled *Sharpening the Focus of Political Will to Address Achievement Disparities*, studied the gaps between English-language learners and their classmates.[13][6] His doctoral major advisor was Barry G. Sheckley and his associate advisor was Casey D. Cobb.[13]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nCardona began his career as a fourth-grade teacher at Israel Putnam Elementary School in Meriden, Connecticut. In 2003, at Hanover Elementary School, he was promoted and made the youngest principal in the state's history for ten years. From 2015 to 2019, Cardona served as assistant superintendent for teaching and learning in his home town.[14][15]\n\n\nCardona was also an adjunct professor of education in the University of Connecticut's Department of Educational Leadership.[16] During his career, he has focused on closing gaps between English-language learners and their peers.[6]\n\n\nIn August 2019, Governor Ned Lamont appointed Cardona as commissioner of education; Cardona was the first Latino to hold the position.[12][11] During his tenure, Cardona helped oversee state schools' response to the COVID-19 pandemic, where he expressed concerns over the long-term mental health impacts of remote education on students.[8]\n\n\n\n## Secretary of Education[edit]\n\n\n### Nomination[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2020, Cardona emerged as a candidate for United States secretary of education in Joe Biden's cabinet. Biden began to lean toward Cardona over two other \"high-profile\" teachers' union leaders, Lily Eskelsen Garc\u00eda and Randi Weingarten. By choosing Cardona over the two, Biden \"appeared to have sidestepped any sibling rivalry between the NEA and AFT.\"[17][18]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cardona talks with reporters during a press briefing on August 5, 2021, at the White House.\nCardona was brought to the attention of Biden by Linda Darling-Hammond, the leader of the transition's education secretary search efforts, a role she also filled for Barack Obama in 2008. Darling-Hammond and Cardona had worked together on numerous projects.[11] *Politico* noted that \"Hispanic lawmakers are stressing in particular the need for a Latina to join the administration.\"[19]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nCardona appeared before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions on February 3, 2021.[20] On February 25, his nomination was advanced by the Senate on a cloture vote of 66\u201332.[21] Cardona was confirmed on March 1, 2021 by a 64\u201333 vote.\nCardona took his oath of office on March 1, 2021 and was ceremonially sworn in by Vice President Kamala Harris on March 2, 2021.[22]\n\n\nIn 2021, Cardona solicited a letter from the National School Boards Association to the U.S. Department of Justice asking for federal assistance with what the letter called a \"growing number of threats of violence and acts of intimidation.\"[23] The letter cited examples in several states and listed federal statutes under which assistance could be provided, including \"the PATRIOT Act in regards to domestic terrorism.\" Several Republican elected officials criticized the letter's reference to domestic terrorism and called for Cardona to resign.[24]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn 2002, Cardona married Marissa P\u00e9rez, a family-school liaison.[25] P\u00e9rez was named Miss Connecticut in 2001 and Miss Connecticut Teen USA in 1996.[26][25] Cardona and his wife have two children: a son, Miguel, Jr., and a daughter, Celine.[12] Cardona is Catholic.[27]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"On the Nomination (Confirmation: Miguel A.

It is the principal official advisory body to the president of the United States. The president chairs the meetings but is not formally a member of the Cabinet. The heads of departments, appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, are members of the Cabinet, and acting department heads also participate in Cabinet meetings whether or not they have been officially nominated for Senate confirmation. The president may designate heads of other agencies and non-Senate-confirmed members of the Executive Office of the President as members of the Cabinet.\n\n\nThe Cabinet does not have any collective executive powers or functions of its own, and no votes need to be taken. There are 25 members (26 including the vice president): 15 department heads and 10 Cabinet-level members, all of whom, except two, require Senate confirmation. The Cabinet meets with the president in a room adjacent to the Oval Office. The members sit in the order in which their respective department was created, with the earliest being closest to the president and the newest farthest away.[1]\n\n\nThe members of the Cabinet serve at the pleasure of the president, who can dismiss them at any time without the approval of the Senate, as affirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States in *Myers v. United States* (1926) or downgrade their Cabinet membership status. Often it is legally possible for a Cabinet member to exercise certain powers over his or her own department against the president's wishes, but in practice this is highly unusual due to the threat of dismissal. The president also has the authority to organize the Cabinet, such as instituting committees. Like all federal public officials, Cabinet members are also subject to impeachment by the House of Representatives and trial in the Senate for \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\".\n\n\nThe Constitution of the United States does not explicitly establish a Cabinet. The Cabinet's role, inferred from the language of the Opinion Clause (Article\u00a0II, Section\u00a02, Clause\u00a01) of the Constitution is to provide advice to the president. Additionally, the Twenty-fifth Amendment authorizes the vice president, together with a majority of the heads of the executive departments, to declare the president \"unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office\". The heads of the executive departments are\u2014if eligible\u2014in the presidential line of succession.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)James K. Polk and his Cabinet in 1846: the first Cabinet to be photographed.\nThe tradition of the Cabinet arose out of the debates at the 1787 Constitutional Convention regarding whether the president would exercise executive authority solely or collaboratively with a cabinet of ministers or a privy council. As a result of the debates, the Constitution (Article\u00a0II, Section\u00a01, Clause\u00a01) vests \"all executive power\" in the president singly, and authorizes\u2014but does not compel\u2014the president (Article\u00a0II, Section\u00a02, Clause\u00a01) to \"require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices\".[2][3] The Constitution does not specify what the executive departments will be, how many there will be, or what their duties will be.\n\n\nGeorge Washington, the first president of the United States, organized his principal officers into a Cabinet, and it has been part of the executive branch structure ever since. Washington's Cabinet consisted of five members: himself, Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, Secretary of War Henry Knox and Attorney General Edmund Randolph. Vice President John Adams was not included in Washington's Cabinet because the position was initially regarded as a legislative officer (president of the Senate).[4] Furthermore, until there was a vacancy in the presidency (which did not occur until the death of William Henry Harrison in 1841) it was not certain that a vice president would be allowed to serve as president for the duration of the original term as opposed to merely acting as president until new elections could be held. It was not until the 20th century that vice presidents were regularly included as members of the Cabinet and came to be regarded primarily as a member of the executive branch.\n\n\nPresidents have used Cabinet meetings of selected principal officers but to widely differing extents and for different purposes. During President Abraham Lincoln's administration, Secretary of State William H. Seward advocated the use of a parliamentary-style Cabinet government. However, Lincoln rebuffed Seward. While a professor Woodrow Wilson also advocated a parliamentary-style Cabinet, but after becoming president did not implement it in his administration. In recent administrations, Cabinets have grown to include key White House staff in addition to department and various agency heads. President Ronald Reagan formed seven sub-cabinet councils to review many policy issues, and subsequent presidents have followed that practice.[3]\n\n\n\n## Federal law[edit]\n\n\nIn 3\u00a0U.S.C.\u00a0\u00a7\u00a0302 with regard to delegation of authority by the president, it is provided that \"nothing herein shall be deemed to require express authorization in any case in which such an official would be presumed in law to have acted by authority or direction of the president.\" This pertains directly to the heads of the executive departments as each of their offices is created and specified by statutory law (hence the presumption) and thus gives them the authority to act for the president within their areas of responsibility without any specific delegation.\n\n\nUnder 5\u00a0U.S.C.\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03110 (also known as the 1967 Federal Anti-Nepotism statute), federal officials are prohibited from appointing their immediate family members to certain governmental positions, including those in the Cabinet.[5]\n\n\nUnder the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998, an administration may appoint acting heads of department from employees of the relevant department. These may be existing high-level career employees, from political appointees of the outgoing administration (for new administrations), or sometimes lower-level appointees of the administration.[6]\n\n\n\n## Confirmation process[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Historical makeup of the Cabinet of the United States by year.\nThe heads of the executive departments and all other federal agency heads are nominated by the president and then presented to the Senate for confirmation or rejection by a simple majority (although before the use of the \"nuclear option\" during the 113th United States Congress, they could have been blocked by filibuster, requiring cloture to be invoked by 3\u20445 supermajority to further consideration). If approved, they receive their commission scroll, are sworn in, and begin their duties. When the Senate is not in session, the president can appoint acting heads of the executive departments, and do so at the beginning of their term.\n\n\nAn elected vice president does not require Senate confirmation, nor does the White House Chief of Staff, which is an appointed staff position of the Executive Office of the President.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Office\n | Senate confirmation review committee\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Secretary of State | Foreign Relations Committee |\n| Secretary of the Treasury | Finance Committee |\n| Secretary of Defense | Armed Services Committee |\n| Attorney General | Judiciary Committee |\n| Secretary of the Interior | Energy and Natural Resources Committee |\n| Secretary of Agriculture | Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee |\n| Secretary of Commerce | Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee |\n| Secretary of Labor | Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee |\n| Secretary of Health and Human Services | Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee (consult)Finance Committee (official)\n |\n| Secretary of Housing and Urban Development | Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee |\n| Secretary of Transportation | Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee\n |\n| Secretary of Energy | Energy and Natural Resources Committee |\n| Secretary of Education | Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee\n |\n| Secretary of Veterans Affairs | Veterans Affairs Committee |\n| Secretary of Homeland Security | Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee |\n| Trade Representative | Finance Committee\n |\n| Director of National Intelligence | Select Committee on Intelligence |\n| Director of the Office of Management and Budget | Budget CommitteeHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee\n |\n| Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy | Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee\n |\n| Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency | Environment and Public Works Committee |\n| Administrator of the Small Business Administration | Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee |\n\n\n### Salary[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Executive Schedule\n\nThe heads of the executive departments and most other senior federal officers at cabinet or sub-cabinet level receive their salary under a fixed five-level pay plan known as the Executive Schedule, which is codified in Title\u00a05 of the United States Code. Twenty-one positions, including the heads of the executive departments and others, receiving Level\u00a0I pay are listed in 5\u00a0U.S.C.\u00a0\u00a7\u00a05312, and those forty-six positions on Level\u00a0II pay (including the number two positions of the executive departments) are listed in 5\u00a0U.S.C.\u00a0\u00a7\u00a05313. As of January\u00a02023[update], the Level\u00a0I annual pay was set at $235,600.\n\n\nThe annual salary of the vice president is $235,300.[7] The salary level was set by the Government Salary Reform Act of 1989, which provides an automatic cost of living adjustment for federal employees. The vice president receives the same pension as other members of Congress based on their *ex officio* position as the president of the Senate.[8]\n\n\n\n## Current Cabinet and Cabinet-rank officials[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Cabinet of Joe Biden\n\nThe individuals listed below were nominated by President Joe Biden to form his Cabinet and were confirmed by the United States Senate on the date noted or are serving as acting department heads by his request, pending the confirmation of his nominees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Vice president and the heads of the executive departments[edit]\n\n\nSee also: United States federal executive departments\n\nThe Cabinet permanently includes the vice president and the heads of 15 executive departments, listed here according to their order of succession to the presidency. The speaker of the House and the president *pro tempore* of the Senate follow the vice president and precede the secretary of state in the order of succession, but both are in the legislative branch and are not part of the Cabinet.\n\n\n\n\n\nCabinet\n| Office(Constituting instrument) | Incumbent\n | Took office\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)Vice President(Constitution, Article II, Section I) | ![](image)Kamala Harris | January 20, 2021\n |\n| ![](image)Secretary of State(22\u00a0U.S.C.\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02651a) | ![](image)Antony Blinken | January 26, 2021\n |\n| ![](image)Secretary of the Treasury(31\u00a0U.S.C.\u00a0\u00a7\u00a0301) | ![](image)Janet Yellen | January 26, 2021\n |\n| ![](image)Secretary of Defense(10\u00a0U.S.C.\u00a0\u00a7\u00a0113) | ![](image)Lloyd Austin | January 22, 2021\n |\n| ![](image)Attorney General(28\u00a0U.S.C.\u00a0\u00a7\u00a0503) | ![](image)Merrick Garland | March 11, 2021\n |\n| ![](image)Secretary of the Interior(43\u00a0U.S.C.\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01451) | ![](image)Deb Haaland | March 16, 2021\n |\n| ![](image)Secretary of Agriculture(7\u00a0U.S.C.\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02202) | ![](image)Tom Vilsack | February 24, 2021\n |\n| ![](image)Secretary of Commerce(15\u00a0U.S.C.\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01501) | ![](image)Gina Raimondo | March 3, 2021\n |\n| ![](image)Secretary of Labor(29\u00a0U.S.C.\u00a0\u00a7\u00a0551) | ![](image)Julie SuActing | March 11, 2023\n |\n| ![](image)Secretary of Health and Human Services(Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1953,67\u00a0Stat.\u00a0631 and 42\u00a0U.S.C.\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03501) | ![](image)Xavier Becerra | March 19, 2021\n |\n| ![](image)Secretary of Housing and Urban Development(42\u00a0U.S.C.\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03532) | ![](image)Marcia Fudge | March 10, 2021\n |\n| ![](image)Secretary of Transportation(49\u00a0U.S.C.\u00a0\u00a7\u00a0102) | ![](image)Pete Buttigieg | February 3, 2021\n |\n| ![](image)Secretary of Energy(42\u00a0U.S.C.\u00a0\u00a7\u00a07131) | ![Secretary Jennifer Granholm](image)Jennifer Granholm | February 25, 2021\n |\n| ![](image)Secretary of Education(20\u00a0U.S.C.\u00a0\u00a7\u00a03411) | ![](image)Miguel Cardona | March 2, 2021\n |\n| ![](image)Secretary of Veterans Affairs(38\u00a0U.S.C.\u00a0\u00a7\u00a0303) | ![](image)Denis McDonough | February 9, 2021\n |\n| ![](image)Secretary of Homeland Security(6\u00a0U.S.C.\u00a0\u00a7\u00a0112) | ![](image)Alejandro Mayorkas | February 2, 2021\n |\n\n\n### Cabinet-level officials[edit]\n\n\nThe president may designate additional positions to be members of the Cabinet, which can vary under each president.

Unlike her predecessors, she is viewed as more of an academic economist than a traditional politician used to horse-trading and dealmaking, qualities that could be critical to achieving the goals of Biden's economic agenda in a deeply partisan Congress.[125][126][127] All living former U.S. treasury secretaries, from George Shultz to Jack Lew, endorsed Yellen for the position in a bipartisan letter calling on the Senate to swiftly confirm her.[128]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHonorary degrees\n| Location\n | Date\n | School\n | Degree\n | Gave Commencement Address\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Rhode Island\n | May 25, 1998\n | Brown University | Doctor of Laws (LL.D.)[196] | Yes[197] |\n| ![](image)\u00a0New York\n | May 27, 2000\n | Bard College | Doctor of Humane Letters (DHL)[198] | No\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0New York\n | May 21, 2014\n | New York University | Doctor of Commercial Science (DCS)[199] | Yes[200] |\n| ![](image)\u00a0England\n | May 15, 2015\n | London School of Economics | Doctor of Science (DSc)[201] | No\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Connecticut\n | May 15, 2015\n | Yale University | Doctor of Social Science (DSSc)[202] | No\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0England\n | November 19, 2015\n | University of Warwick | Doctor of Laws (LL.D.)[203] | No\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Maryland\n | December 19, 2016\n | University of Baltimore | Doctor of Laws (LL.D.)[204] | Yes[205] |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Israel\n | June 5, 2019\n | Tel Aviv University | Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.)[206] | No\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Michigan\n | December 15, 2019\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* Ewalt, David M.

He previously served as a United States circuit judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit from 1997 to 2021. In 2016, President Barack Obama nominated Garland to the U.S. Supreme Court, but the Republican-led U.S. Senate effectively blocked Garland's appointment.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPresident Barack Obama, a Democrat, nominated Garland to serve as an associate justice of the Supreme Court in March 2016 to fill the vacancy created by the death of Antonin Scalia. However, the Republican Senate majority refused to hold a hearing or vote on his nomination. The unprecedented refusal of a Senate majority to consider a Supreme Court nomination was highly controversial. Garland's nomination lasted 293 days (the longest to date), and it expired on January 3, 2017, at the end of the 114th Congress. Eventually, President Donald Trump, a Republican, nominated Neil Gorsuch to the vacant seat, and the Republican Senate majority confirmed him.\n\n\nPresident Joe Biden nominated Garland as U.S. attorney general in January 2021. He was confirmed by the Senate in a 70\u201330 vote, and took office in March of that same year.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nMerrick Brian Garland was born on November 13, 1952, in Chicago.[1] He grew up in the north Chicago border suburb of Lincolnwood.[2][3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n119. **^** @TheJusticeDept (March 11, 2021). \"Judge Merrick Garland takes his oath of office as the 86th Attorney General of the United States as he is sworn in by Assistant Attorney General for Administration Lee Lofthus\" (Tweet).

U.S. Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia was ultimately selected.[4] On December 10, 2020, President-elect Joe Biden announced his intention to nominate Vilsack to once again serve as secretary of agriculture in the incoming Biden administration.[5][3] Vilsack was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on February 23, 2021, by a vote of 92\u20137.[6] Vilsack is the second-longest serving Secretary of Agriculture in American history.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nVilsack was born on December 13, 1950, in a Roman Catholic orphanage in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where his 23-year-old birth mother (a secretary) had lived since September 1950 under the pseudonym of \"Gloria\"; he was baptized as \"Kenneth\".[7] He was adopted in 1951 by Bud, a real-estate agent and insurance salesman, and Dolly Vilsack. They named him Thomas James.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Vilsack's 2009 official portrait during his first tenure as Agriculture secretary\n![](image)Vilsack introduces President Barack Obama at the Northeast Iowa Community College, for a White House Rural Economic Forum on August 16, 2011.\nOn December 17, 2008, then-President-elect Barack Obama announced his choice of Vilsack as the nominee to be the 30th Secretary of Agriculture.[29] Vilsack has governed a largely agricultural state as did the previous two Secretaries of Agriculture, Mike Johanns (who was later a United States Senator from Nebraska) (2005\u20132007) and Ed Schafer (2007\u20132009).\n\n\nThe Senate confirmed Vilsack's nomination for the position by unanimous consent on January 20, 2009.[30]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn November 30, 2006, he formally launched his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination in the 2008 election, but ended his bid on February 23, 2007.[1] President-elect Barack Obama announced Vilsack's selection to be Secretary of Agriculture on December 17, 2008. His nomination was confirmed by the United States Senate by unanimous consent on January 20, 2009. Until his January 13, 2017 resignation[2] one week prior to the end of Obama's second term as president, he had been the only member of the U.S. Cabinet who had served since the day Obama originally took office. As of the end of that term[update] he was the fourth-longest-serving holder of the office.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Vilsack's campaign logo\nVilsack's campaign made significant use of social media by maintaining an active MySpace profile, a collection of viral video clips on YouTube, a Facebook profile, videoblog on blip.tv,[21] and a conference call with the podcast site TalkShoe.[22] On January 27, 2007, Vilsack called into the Regular Guys Show hosted by Kurt Hurner to conduct a 15\u2011minute interview on his running for the Democratic nomination for 2008. Since then, Vilsack appeared again on the show, now The Kurt Hurner Show at Talk Shoe on August 12, 2008, this time as a supporter of Barack Obama for president taking questions from callers to the program for 30 minutes.\n\n\nDuring the campaign, Vilsack joined fellow candidates Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden in supporting the establishment of a U.S. Public Service Academy as a civilian counterpart to the military academies.[23]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n (1950-12-13) December 13, 1950 (age\u00a073)Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, U.S. |\n| Political party | Democratic |\n| Spouse | \nChristie Bell\n \u200b\n(m.\u00a01973)\u200b\n |\n| Children | 2 |\n| Residence | Mount Pleasant, Iowa |\n| Education | Hamilton College (BA)Albany Law School (JD) |\n| Occupation | * Politician\n* lawyer\n |\n| Signature | ![](image) |\n| Tom Vilsack's voice\n\n\nTom Vilsack speaks on free school meals for students and declining hunger ratesRecorded May 5, 2021\n |\n|  |\n\n\n**Thomas James Vilsack** (/\u02c8v\u026als\u00e6k/; born December 13, 1950) is an American politician serving as the 32nd United States secretary of agriculture in the Biden administration.

It also called for replacing the Department of Energy with a new Department of Energy Security, to oversee and redefine the federal government's role in energy policy. The reorganized department would have acted as an institutional advocate for innovation in energy policy and was intended to ensure accountability as the nation works towards achieving its energy security goals. Through this new department, America's overriding objective in energy policy would have been to make America the unquestioned leader in clean energy, enhancing national security and economic strength.[27]\n\n\nIn a 2007 lecture to the Commonwealth Club of California, Vilsack stated:[28]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Biography at the United States Department of Agriculture\n* Biography at the United States Department of Agriculture (2009\u20132017, archived)\n* Appearances on *Charlie Rose*\n* Appearances on C-SPAN\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n53. **^** \"USDA To Launch Loan Guarantee Initiative to Create More and Better Market Opportunities, Promote Competition and Strengthen America's Food Supply Chain\". *www.usda.gov*.

In the first report, he raised over half a million dollars.

Though first seen as a likely Secretary of Health and Human Services, Raimondo announced on December 3, 2020, that she would not be taking that role.[82] She was also considered for Secretary of the Treasury.[83][84]\n\n\nOn January 7, 2021, Biden announced he would nominate Raimondo to serve as Secretary of Commerce.[85] She appeared before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation on January 26.[86] On March 1, the Senate voted 84\u201315 in favor of cloture on the nomination, and confirmed Raimondo to the position the following day by a vote of 84\u201315.[87]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPress secretary Jennifer Bogdan Jones of the Governor's Office told *The Providence Journal* that Raimondo \"is prepared to do whatever it takes to support Mike and defeat President Trump.\"[79] As campaign co-chair, Raimondo would have \"provided advice and attended events\". Less than a month later, Bloomberg dropped out of the race and endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden.[80] On the same day, Raimondo also endorsed Biden. She said Bloomberg \"obviously\" performed poorly on the debate stage but supporting his candidacy \"was an easy decision for me at the beginning. But [supporting Biden] is an easy decision, too.\" Raimondo concluded that it was now time \"to unify behind Joe Biden\".[81]\n\n\nIn May 2020, writer George Will wrote in favor of Raimondo being chosen as Biden's running mate in the 2020 election.[18] U.S. Senator Kamala Harris was chosen instead.\n\n\n\n## Secretary of Commerce (2021\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\n### Nomination[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2014, Raimondo was elected governor in a three-way contest with 41% of the vote.[5] While in office, Raimondo was elected to serve as vice chair of the Democratic Governors Association (DGA) for the 2018 election cycle.[6] Reelected in 2018, Raimondo was tasked with overseeing the state's initial response to the COVID-19 pandemic.[7][8] In the 2020 presidential election, she served as co-chair of Michael Bloomberg's 2020 presidential campaign.[9]\n\n\nDescribed as a \"moderate technocrat\" by *The Washington Post*,[10] Raimondo is often characterized as a centrist within her party.[11][12][13] Chosen to serve as Secretary of Commerce by President Joe Biden,[1] she played a leading role in negotiations for the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act in 2021.[14]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGina Marie Raimondo was born in 1971[15] in Smithfield, Rhode Island, where she later grew up. Of Italian descent, she is the youngest of Josephine (Piro) and Joseph Raimondo's three children.[16][17] Her father, Joseph (1926\u20132014), made his career at the Bulova watch factory in Providence, Rhode Island; he became unemployed at 56 when the Bulova company moved its operations to China, shuttering the factory in Providence.[18] Raimondo is a childhood friend of U.S. Senator Jack Reed.[19]\n\n\nRaimondo graduated from LaSalle Academy in Providence. She was one of the first girls allowed to attend the Catholic school, from which she was graduated as valedictorian.[20][21] She went on to Harvard College, graduating *magna cum laude* in 1993 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics. While at Harvard, Raimondo resided in Quincy House and served on the staff of *The Harvard Crimson*. She played rugby at the Radcliffe Rugby Club, later joking that the experience \"was good training for a career in politics\".[22]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* List of female governors in the United States\n* List of female United States Cabinet members\n* COVID-19 pandemic in Rhode Island\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Biography at the United States Department of Commerce\n* Campaign website Archived January 27, 2021, at the Wayback Machine\n* Appearances on C-SPAN\n\n\n* Profile at Vote Smart\n* Inauguration Program from the Rhode Island State Archives\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n106. **^** Wong, Kandy; Jennings, Ralph; Nulimaimaiti, Mia (August 29, 2023). \"As Gina Raimondo wraps up Beijing leg of China trip with high-level meetings, will it be a litmus test for relations?\". *South China Morning Post*.

Su** (born February 19, 1969)[1][2] is an American attorney and government official who has served as acting United States Secretary of Labor since 2023[3] and the 37th United States Deputy Secretary of Labor since 2021. Before assuming that post, Su was the California Labor Secretary, serving under Governor Gavin Newsom from 2019 to 2021,[4] and was the California Labor Commissioner, overseeing California's Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE), under Governor Jerry Brown from 2011 to 2018.[5][6]\n\n\nShe is serving as acting secretary of labor since March 11, 2023 following the departure of incumbent Marty Walsh from the role.[7][8] In February 2023, President Joe Biden officially nominated Su to be his permanent appointee to fill the position.[9] Since her nomination, Su's confirmation has stalled in the Senate; however, the Biden administration plans on keeping Su in an acting capacity which the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has allowed.[10]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nSu was born in Wisconsin as a first-generation American. Her mother, unable to afford a ticket on a passenger ship, came to the United States on a cargo ship from China; her father is from Taiwan.[11][12] She graduated from Whitney High School in Cerritos, California. She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Stanford University and a Juris Doctor from Harvard Law School.[13]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nSu started her legal career at the Asian-Pacific American Legal Center. She was a Litigation Director for Advancing Justice L.A., a non-profit civil rights organization.\n\n\nSu was the lead attorney for the El Monte Thai Garment Slavery Case.[14] As the lead for civil case brought by the El Monte garment workers, Su successfully pursued a legal theory that held manufacturers responsible for the wage theft, as well as the operators who actually kept the garment workers captive. She and other activists also petitioned for the workers to be able to stay in the United States under a visa program for those who cooperate with the government in criminal trials. This led to the creation of the T-Visa for victims of human trafficking.[15]\n\n\nDuring Jerry Brown's tenure as governor, Su headed California's Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE) as the California Labor Commissioner.[6] Under Governor Gavin Newsom, Su served as Secretary of the California Labor and Workforce Development Agency.[4]\n\n\n\n## United States Department of Labor[edit]\n\n\n### Deputy Secretary of Labor[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2020, Su was named as a potential candidate to serve as Secretary of Labor in the Biden administration.[16][17] Su's prospective nomination was pushed by AAPI political leaders and activists, including the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus (CAPAC).[18]\n\n\nConversely, she was opposed by business groups and congressional Republicans. Opponents criticized her leadership of California's unemployment agency during the COVID-19 pandemic,[19] when over a million legitimate applicants had their claims delayed or frozen,[4] while up to $31 billion was sent to fraudulent claimants (including to criminals belonging to national and international crime rings and inmates in the state's prison system).[20][21] Opposition also centered on her enforcement of California's controversial employment law, AB 5.[22][23]\n\n\nOn February 10, 2021, Su was nominated by President Biden to be the Deputy Secretary of Labor under Secretary Marty Walsh. Asian-American leaders, including members of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, had lobbied the Biden administration to appoint her as Deputy Secretary after she wasn't chosen to lead the department.[24]\n\n\nThe Senate HELP Committee held hearings on Su's nomination on March 16, 2021. The committee favorably reported her nomination to the Senate floor on April 21, 2021.[25] On July 13, 2021, Su was confirmed to the role by the Senate, in a 50\u201347 vote.[26]\n\n\n\n### Secretary of Labor nomination[edit]\n\n\nAfter it was reported in 2023 that Walsh would leave the role, Su was expected to serve as acting secretary of labor in his absence.[7][27] After Walsh's resignation announcement, members of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus called on Biden to nominate Su as Walsh's permanent successor, citing the lack of Asian-Americans in Biden's cabinet.[28] On February 28, 2023, President Joe Biden nominated Su to serve as the United States secretary of labor.[9]\n\n\nSu's nomination faced challenges on both sides of the aisle, due to the reluctance of Senator Joe Manchin to support her, as well as Republican criticism of her handling of covid unemployment relief funding in California, wherein an estimated $32 billion meant to safeguard unemployed Californians during the pandemic ended up being paid out fraudulently.[29][30] She is currently waiting on confirmation from the full Senate where the confirmation process has stalled due to a lack of votes necessary for confirmation. However, she remains the Acting Secretary of Labor in the interim.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nSu's support for California Assembly Bill 5 (2019) and the California FAST Recovery Act, two labor laws that have proven contentious, led to reason business interests criticizing her nomination.[31]\n\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\n* Skadden Fellowship\n* 2001 MacArthur Fellows Program\n* 1996 Reebok International Human Rights Award[32]\n\n\n## Works[edit]\n\n\n* \"Making the Invisible Visible: The Garment Industry's Dirty Laundry\" *University of Iowa Journal on Gender, Race & Justice* (winter 1997\u20131998)\n* \"Critical Coalitions,\" (with Eric Yamamoto) *Critical Race Theory: An Anthology*\n* \"Workers at the Crossfire: Immigration Enforcement to Preserve Capital,\" in *Unfinished Liberation* (Joy James, ed.

March 18, 2021, with all but one Democrat present and one Republican, Susan Collins, voting in favor.[80][81] This was the narrowest vote for any of Biden's cabinet positions.

A member of the Democratic Party, she served as the U.S. representative for Ohio's 11th congressional district from 2008 to 2021. The district includes most of the black-majority precincts between Cleveland and Akron.\n\n\nFollowing the death of Stephanie Tubbs Jones in 2008, Fudge ran unopposed in the special election to replace her.[1] She was chair of the Congressional Black Caucus in the 113th Congress.[2] She considered running for Speaker of the United States House of Representatives at the start of the 116th Congress but eventually announced she would back Nancy Pelosi.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2015, Fudge wrote a letter asking for leniency in the sentencing of Cleveland politician Lance Mason on felony assault and domestic violence charges.[50] Fudge described Mason as \"kind\", and wrote that \"Lance [...] has assured me that something like this will never happen again.\"[50] Mason subsequently attacked and killed his ex-wife, in 2018, stabbing her 59 times.[51] After the murder, Fudge released a statement saying she condemned the crimes committed by Mason.[52]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of African-American United States representatives\n* Women in the United States House of Representatives\n* List of African-American United States Cabinet members\n* List of female United States Cabinet members\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn March 2021, during a White House press conference, Fudge made comments on the upcoming Senate election in her home state of Ohio suggesting that Democrats could win it. As a result, she was accused of violating the Hatch Act of 1939.[37][38] After an investigation, the Office of Special Counsel determined she had violated the Hatch Act. Fudge received a warning.[39]\n\n\n\n#### Racial impact of housing problems[edit]\n\n\nIn one of her first acts as secretary, Fudge discussed the effects of homelessness on people of color, evictions in the United States, and creating avenues for fair housing with civil rights leaders including Marc Morial and Al Sharpton.[40][41]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nChairs of the Congressional Black Caucus\n |\n| --- |\n| * Diggs\n* Stokes\n* Rangel\n* Burke\n* Mitchell\n* Collins\n* Fauntroy\n* Dixon\n* Leland\n* Dymally\n* Dellums\n* Towns\n* Mfume\n* Payne\n* Waters\n* Clyburn\n* Johnson\n* Cummings\n* Watt\n* Kilpatrick\n* Lee\n* Cleaver\n* Fudge\n* Butterfield\n* Richmond\n* Bass\n* Beatty\n* Horsford\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Part of this was done at Bagram Air Base, but he was also an armed driver for his commander on more than 100 trips into Kabul. Buttigieg has jokingly referred to his role as an armed driver as \"military Uber\", because he had to watch out for ambushes and explosive devices along the roads and ensure that the vehicle was guarded.[62] Also, while deployed in Afghanistan, Buttigieg was assigned to the Afghan Threat Finance Cell, a counterterrorism unit that targeted Taliban insurgency financing.[63][64] Buttigieg was awarded the Joint Service Commendation Medal,[65] and he left the U.S. Navy Reserve in 2017.[66][67][68]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

However, she made clear early on that she was not interested, which was reported to have \"stunned\" senior Democrats, who were \"surprised and disappointed\" that Granholm had taken herself out of the running. U.S. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida was elected instead.[109]\n\n\nAfter President Obama was re-elected in 2012, Granholm was reportedly considered for a position in Obama's second-term Cabinet, specifically to succeed Chu as secretary of energy, Ray LaHood as U.S. secretary of transportation, Hilda Solis as U.S. secretary of labor or Eric Holder as U.S attorney general.[110][111][112][113][114] Granholm herself dampened such speculation, citing her sharp criticism of Republicans during the 2012 election and her time presenting on Current TV.[115]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGranholm was twice mentioned as a possible U.S. Secretary of Energy, first in December 2008 when President-elect Obama was assembling his first-term Cabinet[98] and again in December 2010, when it was rumoured that Secretary Steven Chu might resign.[99]\n\n\nGranholm was also twice considered by President Obama to be a potential Supreme Court candidate.[100][101][102][103][104][105] In May 2009, she was on the shortlist of candidates to replace the retiring Associate Justice David Souter.[106] She attended a CAFE standards meeting at the White House on May 19 and spoke with Obama, but officials would not comment on whether the two discussed a potential court appointment.[107] Obama chose Sonia Sotomayor, who was confirmed by the Senate in August. After the retirement of Associate Justice John Paul Stevens in May 2010, Granholm was again spoken of as a potential candidate;[108] Obama chose Elena Kagan, who was confirmed in August.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Department of Energy, Labor, and Economic Growth reported back in October 2009 that 62,206 people had enrolled and that of the 34,355 who had completed training, 72% had found work or retained their positions and a further 18,000 were still in long-term or short-term training.[57][58] 16% of all enrollees had withdrawn or failed to complete the training.[58] As of July 2010, more than two years after the program was launched, 65,536 people were in training or involved in on-the-job training.[55] Dropouts had been reduced to 13.1% of enrollments.[55]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Judy Woodruff\n* Paula Zahn\n |\n| Past correspondents | * Katie Benner\n* Mike Brooks\n* Samuel Burke\n* Sara Ganim\n* Drew Griffin\n* Kaylee Hartung\n* Ed Henry\n* John Harwood\n* John Holliman\n* Joe Johns\n* Sam Kiley\n* Andrea Koppel\n* Michelle Kosinski\n* Liz Landers\n* Ian James Lee\n* Suzanne Malveaux\n* Erin McPike\n* Chloe Melas\n* Ryan Nobles\n* Miles O'Brien\n* Lola Ogunnaike\n* Keith Olbermann\n* Ash-har Quraishi\n* Christine Romans\n* Martin Savidge\n* Laurie Segall\n* Farai Sevenzo\n* Barbara Starr\n* Adaora Udoji\n* Jessica Yellin\n |\n| Past contributors | * John Avlon\n* Katie Benner\n* Tucker Carlson\n* Chris Cillizza\n* Stephanie Cutter\n* Lanny Davis\n* Newt Gingrich\n* LZ Granderson\n* Jennifer Granholm\n* Jeffrey Lord\n* Kayleigh McEnany\n* Jen Psaki\n* Rick Santorum\n* Tara Setmayer\n* Alice Stewart\n* Jeffrey Toobin\n* J.

Granholm was mentioned as a candidate to succeed him,[116] but she announced shortly after that she would not run.[117] She endorsed U.S. Representative Gary Peters,[118] who defeated Republican nominee Terri Lynn Land in the general election.\n\n\nIn September 2014, when U.S Attorney General Eric Holder announced his intention to step down, there was speculation that Granholm might be a potential candidate to succeed him.[119] Loretta Lynch was ultimately nominated and confirmed for the position.\n\n\nThere was speculation that Granholm's increased visibility from her senior role in the Clinton campaign indicated that she would be under consideration for a position in the U.S. Cabinet or Democratic National Committee leadership if Clinton had won the 2016 election.[120]\n\n\n\n## Secretary of Energy (2021\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n76. **^** \"Jennifer M.

She was re-elected in 2006.\n\n\nGranholm was a member of the presidential transition team for Barack Obama before he assumed office in 2009.[1] After leaving public office, Granholm took a position at the UC Berkeley and, with her husband Daniel Mulhern, authored *A Governor's Story: The Fight for Jobs and America's Future*, released in 2011.[2] She became host of *The War Room with Jennifer Granholm*.

In 2004 she asked Lieutenant Governor John D. Cherry to lead the Commission on Higher Education and Economic Growth to double the number of college graduates in Michigan. Many of the commission's recommendations were enacted into law during Granholm's tenure as governor, e.g. increasing high school graduation standards (The Michigan Merit Curriculum) so that every Michigan high school student takes a college preparatory curriculum, which includes four years of math and English/language arts and three years of science and social studies, beginning with students who entered high school in the fall of 2006.[42]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n130. **^** \"US energy secretary blames Opec 'cartel' for high petrol prices\". *Financial Times*.

A member of the Democratic Party, he was confirmed by the U.S. Senate by a vote of 64\u201333 on March 1, 2021.[1] Cardona previously served as commissioner of the Connecticut State Department of Education from 2019 to 2021.\n\n\nA native of Meriden, Connecticut, Cardona began his career as a fourth-grade teacher at Israel Putnam Elementary School in Meriden. In 2003, at the age of twenty-seven, he was named principal of Meriden's Hanover School, making him the youngest principal in the state.[2][3]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nCardona was born on July 11, 1975, in Meriden, Connecticut, to Puerto Rican parents.[4][5] Cardona grew up speaking Spanish as his first language and started to learn English when entering kindergarten.[6][7] His father is a retired police officer in Meriden.[8] Cardona was raised in a housing project in Meriden and graduated from the H.C. Wilcox Technical High School, where he was a part of the automotive studies program.[9][10][11]\n\n\nCardona earned a bachelor of science degree in education from Central Connecticut State University in 1997. He obtained a master of science in bilingual and bicultural education at University of Connecticut (UConn) in 2001. In 2004, he completed a professional sixth year certification at UConn where he earned a doctor of education in 2011.[12][13]\n\n\nCardona's dissertation, titled *Sharpening the Focus of Political Will to Address Achievement Disparities*, studied the gaps between English-language learners and their classmates.[13][6] His doctoral major advisor was Barry G. Sheckley and his associate advisor was Casey D. Cobb.[13]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nCardona began his career as a fourth-grade teacher at Israel Putnam Elementary School in Meriden, Connecticut. In 2003, at Hanover Elementary School, he was promoted and made the youngest principal in the state's history for ten years. From 2015 to 2019, Cardona served as assistant superintendent for teaching and learning in his home town.[14][15]\n\n\nCardona was also an adjunct professor of education in the University of Connecticut's Department of Educational Leadership.[16] During his career, he has focused on closing gaps between English-language learners and their peers.[6]\n\n\nIn August 2019, Governor Ned Lamont appointed Cardona as commissioner of education; Cardona was the first Latino to hold the position.[12][11] During his tenure, Cardona helped oversee state schools' response to the COVID-19 pandemic, where he expressed concerns over the long-term mental health impacts of remote education on students.[8]\n\n\n\n## Secretary of Education[edit]\n\n\n### Nomination[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2020, Cardona emerged as a candidate for United States secretary of education in Joe Biden's cabinet. Biden began to lean toward Cardona over two other \"high-profile\" teachers' union leaders, Lily Eskelsen Garc\u00eda and Randi Weingarten. By choosing Cardona over the two, Biden \"appeared to have sidestepped any sibling rivalry between the NEA and AFT.\"[17][18]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cardona talks with reporters during a press briefing on August 5, 2021, at the White House.\nCardona was brought to the attention of Biden by Linda Darling-Hammond, the leader of the transition's education secretary search efforts, a role she also filled for Barack Obama in 2008. Darling-Hammond and Cardona had worked together on numerous projects.[11] *Politico* noted that \"Hispanic lawmakers are stressing in particular the need for a Latina to join the administration.\"[19]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nCardona appeared before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions on February 3, 2021.[20] On February 25, his nomination was advanced by the Senate on a cloture vote of 66\u201332.[21] Cardona was confirmed on March 1, 2021 by a 64\u201333 vote.\nCardona took his oath of office on March 1, 2021 and was ceremonially sworn in by Vice President Kamala Harris on March 2, 2021.[22]\n\n\nIn 2021, Cardona solicited a letter from the National School Boards Association to the U.S. Department of Justice asking for federal assistance with what the letter called a \"growing number of threats of violence and acts of intimidation.\"[23] The letter cited examples in several states and listed federal statutes under which assistance could be provided, including \"the PATRIOT Act in regards to domestic terrorism.\" Several Republican elected officials criticized the letter's reference to domestic terrorism and called for Cardona to resign.[24]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn 2002, Cardona married Marissa P\u00e9rez, a family-school liaison.[25] P\u00e9rez was named Miss Connecticut in 2001 and Miss Connecticut Teen USA in 1996.[26][25] Cardona and his wife have two children: a son, Miguel, Jr., and a daughter, Celine.[12] Cardona is Catholic.[27]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"On the Nomination (Confirmation: Miguel A.
