As defined by the United States Census Bureau, an incorporated place includes cities, towns, villages, boroughs, and municipalities.[a] A few exceptional census-designated places (CDPs) are also included in the Census Bureau's listing of incorporated places.[b] Consolidated city-counties represent a distinct type of government that includes the entire population of a county, or county equivalent. Some consolidated city-counties, however, include multiple incorporated places. This list presents only the portion of such consolidated city-counties that are not a part of another incorporated place.\n\n\nThis list refers only to the population of individual municipalities within their defined limits; the populations of other municipalities considered suburbs of a central city are listed separately, and unincorporated areas within urban agglomerations are not included. Therefore, a different ranking is evident when considering U.S. urban areas or metropolitan areas.\n\n\n\n\n## 50 states and Washington, D.C.[edit]\n\n\n\nThis table lists the 333 incorporated places in the United States, excluding the U.S. territories, with a population of at least 100,000 as of July 1, 2022, as estimated by the U.S. Census Bureau. Five states have no cities with populations exceeding 100,000. They are: Delaware, Maine, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wyoming.\n\n\nThe table displays:\n\n\n\n1. The city rank by population as of July 1, 2022, as estimated by the United States Census Bureau[1]\n2. The city name[1]\n3. The name of the state in which the city lies[1]\n4. The city population as of July 1, 2022, as estimated by the United States Census Bureau[1]\n5. The city population as of April 1, 2020, as enumerated by the 2020 United States census[1]\n6. The city percent population change from April 1, 2020, to July 1, 2022\n7. The city land area as of January 1, 2020[2]\n8.

A CDP is a concentration of population identified by the United States Census Bureau for statistical purposes. CDPs are delineated for each decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places such as cities, towns and villages. CDPs are populated areas that lack separate municipal government, but which otherwise physically resemble incorporated places. Unlike the incorporated cities in the main list, the US Census Bureau does not release annual population estimates for CDPs.\n\n\nThe table below contains the following information:\n\n\n\n1.

As defined by the United States Census Bureau, an incorporated place includes cities, towns, villages, boroughs, and municipalities.[a] A few exceptional census-designated places (CDPs) are also included in the Census Bureau's listing of incorporated places.[b] Consolidated city-counties represent a distinct type of government that includes the entire population of a county, or county equivalent. Some consolidated city-counties, however, include multiple incorporated places. This list presents only the portion of such consolidated city-counties that are not a part of another incorporated place.\n\n\nThis list refers only to the population of individual municipalities within their defined limits; the populations of other municipalities considered suburbs of a central city are listed separately, and unincorporated areas within urban agglomerations are not included. Therefore, a different ranking is evident when considering U.S. urban areas or metropolitan areas.\n\n\n\n\n## 50 states and Washington, D.C.[edit]\n\n\n\nThis table lists the 333 incorporated places in the United States, excluding the U.S. territories, with a population of at least 100,000 as of July 1, 2022, as estimated by the U.S. Census Bureau. Five states have no cities with populations exceeding 100,000. They are: Delaware, Maine, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wyoming.\n\n\nThe table displays:\n\n\n\n1. The city rank by population as of July 1, 2022, as estimated by the United States Census Bureau[1]\n2. The city name[1]\n3. The name of the state in which the city lies[1]\n4. The city population as of July 1, 2022, as estimated by the United States Census Bureau[1]\n5. The city population as of April 1, 2020, as enumerated by the 2020 United States census[1]\n6.

A CDP is a concentration of population identified by the United States Census Bureau for statistical purposes. CDPs are delineated for each decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places such as cities, towns and villages. CDPs are populated areas that lack separate municipal government, but which otherwise physically resemble incorporated places. Unlike the incorporated cities in the main list, the US Census Bureau does not release annual population estimates for CDPs.\n\n\nThe table below contains the following information:\n\n\n\n1.

states, are considered minor civil divisions by the Census Bureau and are not included in its list of incorporated places. A detailed discussion on this subject can be found at New England town#Census treatment of the New England town system.\n2. **^** The State of Hawaiʻi has no incorporated municipalities other than the City and County of Honolulu, which comprises the entire Island of Oʻahu. In accordance with Hawaiian law, the United States Census Bureau defines the state's cities\"and towns as Census Designated Places (CDPs). The Census Bureau defines the Urban Honolulu CDP as the portion of the City and County of Honolulu that is coextensive with the Judicial District of Honolulu. The Urban Honolulu CDP is what is generally thought of as the \"city\" of Honolulu, and its population is used here and in other population comparisons. The Urban Honolulu CDP is currently the most populous Census Designated Place in the United States. The Honolulu, HI Metropolitan Statistical Area comprises the entire City and County of Honolulu.\n3. **^** Or federal district in the case of Washington, D.C.\n4. **^** Since 1898, the City of New York, New York, has comprised five boroughs with consolidated borough–county governments (2022 population estimates):  \n   •The Borough of Brooklyn and Kings County  \n     (pop. 2,590,516)  \n   •The Borough of Queens and Queens County  \n     (pop. 2,278,029)  \n   •The Borough of Manhattan and New York County  \n     (pop. 1,596,273)  \n   •The Borough of the Bronx and Bronx County  \n     (pop. 1,379,946)  \n   •The Borough of Staten Island and Richmond County  \n     (pop. 491,133)\n5. **^** The City of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, are separate but coterminous entities with a single consolidated city–county government.\n6. **^** The City of Jacksonville, Florida, and Duval County, Florida, are separate entities with a single consolidated city–county government.

In 2050 they will compose 46.3% of the population. Non-Hispanic whites made up 85% of the population in 1960.[165] However, white Americans overall are still projected to make up over 70% of the population in 2050.\n\n\nThe report foresees the Hispanic or Latino population rising from 16% today to 30% by 2050, the Black percentage barely rising from 13.2% to 14.4%, and Asian Americans upping their 4.6% share to 7.8%. The United States had a population of 310 million people in October 2010, and is projected to reach 400 million by 2039 and 439 million in 2050.[166][167][168][169] It is further projected that 82% of the increase in population from 2005 to 2050 will be due to immigrants and their children.[170]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs of 2020, white people numbered 235,411,507 or 71% of the population, including people who identified as white in combination with another race. People who identified as white alone (including Hispanic whites) numbered 204,277,273 or 61.6% of the population and Non-Latino whites made up 57.8% of the country's population.[21]\n\n\nLatino Americans accounted for 51.1% of the total national population growth between 2010 and 2020, increasing from 50.5 million in 2010 to 62.1 million in 2020.[22] The Hispanic or Latino population increased by 23% between 2010 and 2020, an increase of more than 11.6 million.[22] Immigrants and their U.S.-born descendants are expected to provide most of the U.S. population gains in the decades ahead.[23]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHistorical population| Census | Pop. | Note | %± |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1790 | 3,929,214 |  | — |\n| 1800 | 5,236,631 |  | 33.3% |\n| 1810 | 7,239,881 |  | 38.3% |\n| 1820 | 9,638,453 |  | 33.1% |\n| 1830 | 12,866,020 |  | 33.5% |\n| 1840 | 17,069,453 |  | 32.7% |\n| 1850 | 23,191,876 |  | 35.9% |\n| 1860 | 31,443,321 |  | 35.6% |\n| 1870 | 38,558,371 |  | 22.6% |\n| 1880 | 49,371,340 |  | 28.0% |\n| 1890 | 62,979,766 |  | 27.6% |\n| 1900 | 76,212,168 |  | 21.0% |\n| 1910 | 92,228,531 |  | 21.0% |\n| 1920 | 106,021,568 |  | 15.0% |\n| 1930 | 123,202,660 |  | 16.2% |\n| 1940 | 132,165,129 |  | 7.3% |\n| 1950 | 151,325,798 |  | 14.5% |\n| 1960 | 179,323,175 |  | 18.5% |\n| 1970 | 203,211,926 |  | 13.3% |\n| 1980 | 226,545,805 |  | 11.5% |\n| 1990 | 248,709,873 |  | 9.8% |\n| 2000 | 281,421,906 |  | 13.2% |\n| 2010 | 308,745,538 |  | 9.7% |\n| 2020 | 331,449,281 |  | 7.4% |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n27. ^ ***a*** ***b*** America, Good Morning (June 1, 2023). \"Teenage birth rates in the US hit record lows in 2022: CDC report\". *Good Morning America*.

Growth in the Hispanic and Asian populations is predicted to almost triple over the next 40 years. By 2055, the breakdown is estimated to be 48% non-Hispanic white, 24% Hispanic, 16% Black, and 14% Asian.[174]\n\n\nAs of 2015[update], 14% of the United States' population is foreign born, compared to just 5% in 1965. Nearly 39 million immigrants have come to the U.S. since 1965, with most coming from Asia and Latin America. The 2015 Census Report predicts that the percentage of the U.S. population that is foreign-born will continue to increase, reaching 19% by 2060. This increase in the foreign-born population will account for a large share of the overall population growth.[174]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to statistical data made by the Pew Research Center in 2021 about 63% of the US population is Christian, 28% is Unaffiliated, 2% is Jewish, 1% follows Buddhism, 1% follows Hinduism, 1% follows Islam and 2% follow traditional religions and others. Currently, the United States has the largest Christian population in the world (approximately 230-250 million) and the largest Protestant Christian population (approximately 150-160 million). The country also has the second largest Jewish community in the world (after Israel) and the largest Buddhist and Hindu communities in the West, as well as the largest number of followers of Islam in North America. The country has about 64 million non-affiliates (only China and Japan have more).[*citation needed*][183]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n172. **^** \"The Majority of American Babies Are Now Minorities\". *Bloomberg*.

In 2050 they will compose 46.3% of the population. Non-Hispanic whites made up 85% of the population in 1960.[165] However, white Americans overall are still projected to make up over 70% of the population in 2050.\n\n\nThe report foresees the Hispanic or Latino population rising from 16% today to 30% by 2050, the Black percentage barely rising from 13.2% to 14.4%, and Asian Americans upping their 4.6% share to 7.8%. The United States had a population of 310 million people in October 2010, and is projected to reach 400 million by 2039 and 439 million in 2050.[166][167][168][169] It is further projected that 82% of the increase in population from 2005 to 2050 will be due to immigrants and their children.[170]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs of 2020, white people numbered 235,411,507 or 71% of the population, including people who identified as white in combination with another race. People who identified as white alone (including Hispanic whites) numbered 204,277,273 or 61.6% of the population and Non-Latino whites made up 57.8% of the country's population.[21]\n\n\nLatino Americans accounted for 51.1% of the total national population growth between 2010 and 2020, increasing from 50.5 million in 2010 to 62.1 million in 2020.[22] The Hispanic or Latino population increased by 23% between 2010 and 2020, an increase of more than 11.6 million.[22] Immigrants and their U.S.-born descendants are expected to provide most of the U.S. population gains in the decades ahead.[23]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHistorical population| Census | Pop. | Note | %± |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1790 | 3,929,214 |  | — |\n| 1800 | 5,236,631 |  | 33.3% |\n| 1810 | 7,239,881 |  | 38.3% |\n| 1820 | 9,638,453 |  | 33.1% |\n| 1830 | 12,866,020 |  | 33.5% |\n| 1840 | 17,069,453 |  | 32.7% |\n| 1850 | 23,191,876 |  | 35.9% |\n| 1860 | 31,443,321 |  | 35.6% |\n| 1870 | 38,558,371 |  | 22.6% |\n| 1880 | 49,371,340 |  | 28.0% |\n| 1890 | 62,979,766 |  | 27.6% |\n| 1900 | 76,212,168 |  | 21.0% |\n| 1910 | 92,228,531 |  | 21.0% |\n| 1920 | 106,021,568 |  | 15.0% |\n| 1930 | 123,202,660 |  | 16.2% |\n| 1940 | 132,165,129 |  | 7.3% |\n| 1950 | 151,325,798 |  | 14.5% |\n| 1960 | 179,323,175 |  | 18.5% |\n| 1970 | 203,211,926 |  | 13.3% |\n| 1980 | 226,545,805 |  | 11.5% |\n| 1990 | 248,709,873 |  | 9.8% |\n| 2000 | 281,421,906 |  | 13.2% |\n| 2010 | 308,745,538 |  | 9.7% |\n| 2020 | 331,449,281 |  | 7.4% |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n27. ^ ***a*** ***b*** America, Good Morning (June 1, 2023). \"Teenage birth rates in the US hit record lows in 2022: CDC report\". *Good Morning America*.

Growth in the Hispanic and Asian populations is predicted to almost triple over the next 40 years. By 2055, the breakdown is estimated to be 48% non-Hispanic white, 24% Hispanic, 16% Black, and 14% Asian.[174]\n\n\nAs of 2015[update], 14% of the United States' population is foreign born, compared to just 5% in 1965. Nearly 39 million immigrants have come to the U.S. since 1965, with most coming from Asia and Latin America. The 2015 Census Report predicts that the percentage of the U.S. population that is foreign-born will continue to increase, reaching 19% by 2060. This increase in the foreign-born population will account for a large share of the overall population growth.[174]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to statistical data made by the Pew Research Center in 2021 about 63% of the US population is Christian, 28% is Unaffiliated, 2% is Jewish, 1% follows Buddhism, 1% follows Hinduism, 1% follows Islam and 2% follow traditional religions and others. Currently, the United States has the largest Christian population in the world (approximately 230-250 million) and the largest Protestant Christian population (approximately 150-160 million). The country also has the second largest Jewish community in the world (after Israel) and the largest Buddhist and Hindu communities in the West, as well as the largest number of followers of Islam in North America. The country has about 64 million non-affiliates (only China and Japan have more).[*citation needed*][183]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n172. **^** \"The Majority of American Babies Are Now Minorities\". *Bloomberg*.
