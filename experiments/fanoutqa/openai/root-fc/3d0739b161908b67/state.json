It also owns and operates Sam's Club retail warehouses.[11][12]\n\n\nAs of October\u00a031, 2022,[update] Walmart has 10,586 stores and clubs in 24\u00a0countries, operating under 46 different\u00a0names.[2][3][4] The company operates under the name Walmart in the United States and Canada, as Walmart de M\u00e9xico y Centroam\u00e9rica in Mexico and Central America, and as Flipkart Wholesale in India. It has wholly owned operations in Chile, Canada, and South Africa. Since August 2018, Walmart held only a minority stake in Walmart Brasil, which was renamed Grupo Big in August 2019, with 20 percent of the company's shares, and private equity firm Advent International holding 80% ownership of the company. They eventually divested their shareholdings in Grupo Big to French retailer Carrefour, in transaction worth R$7 billion and completed on June 7, 2022.[13]\n\n\nWalmart is the world's largest company by revenue, with about US$570 billion in annual revenue, according to the *Fortune* Global 500 list in October 2022.[14] It is also the largest private employer in the world with 2.2\u00a0million employees. It is a publicly traded family-owned business, as the company is controlled by the Walton family. Sam Walton's heirs own over 50 percent of Walmart through both their holding company Walton Enterprises and their individual holdings.[15] Walmart was the largest United States grocery retailer in 2019, and 65 percent of Walmart's US$510.329\u00a0billion sales came from U.S. operations.[16][17]\n\n\nWalmart was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1972. By 1988, it was the most profitable retailer in the U.S.,[18] and it had become the largest in terms of revenue by October 1989.[19] The company was originally geographically limited to the South and lower Midwest, but it had stores from coast to coast by the early 1990s. Sam's Club opened in New Jersey in November 1989, and the first California outlet opened in Lancaster, in July 1990. A Walmart in York, Pennsylvania, opened in October 1990, the first main store in the Northeast.[20]\n\n\nWalmart's investments outside the U.S. have seen mixed results. Its operations and subsidiaries in Canada,[21] the United Kingdom (ASDA),[22] Central America, South America, and China are successful, but its ventures failed in Germany, Japan, South Korea, Brazil and Argentina.[23][24][25][26]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Walmart\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article **appears to be slanted towards recent events.** Please try to keep recent events in historical perspective and add more content related to non-recent events. *(June 2020)*\n |\n\n\n### 1945\u20131969: Early history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Founder Sam Walton\n![Picture of Sam Walton's original Five and Dime store in Bentonville, Arkansas, now serving as The Walmart Museum.](image)Sam Walton's original Walton's Five and Dime Store in Bentonville, Arkansas, now serving as The Walmart Museum\nIn 1945, businessman and former J. C. Penney employee Sam Walton bought a branch of the Ben Franklin stores from the Butler Brothers.[27] His primary focus was selling products at low prices to get higher-volume sales at a lower profit margin, portraying it as a crusade for the consumer. He experienced setbacks because the lease price and branch purchase were unusually high, but he was able to find lower-cost suppliers than those used by other stores and was consequently able to undercut his competitors on pricing.[28] Sales increased 45 percent in his first year of ownership to US$105,000 in revenue, which increased to $140,000 the next year and $175,000 the year after that. Within the fifth year, the store was generating $250,000 in revenue. The lease then expired for the location and Walton was unable to reach an agreement for renewal, so he opened up a new store at 105 N. Main Street in Bentonville, naming it \"Walton's Five and Dime\".[28][29] That store is now the Walmart Museum.[30]\n\n\n\n![](image)Wal-Mart logo from 1962 to 1964\nOn July 2, 1962, Walton opened the first Wal-Mart Discount City store at 719 W. Walnut Street in Rogers, Arkansas. Its design was inspired by Ann & Hope, which Walton visited in 1961, as did Kmart founder Harry B. Cunningham.[31][32] The name was derived from FedMart, a chain of discount department stores founded by Sol Price in 1954, whom Walton was also inspired by. Walton stated that he liked the idea of calling his discount chain \"Wal-Mart\" because he \"really liked Sol's FedMart name\". The building is now occupied by a hardware store and an antiques mall, while the company's \"Store #1\" has since expanded to a Supercenter several blocks west at 2110 W. Walnut Street. Within its first five years, the company expanded to 18 stores in Arkansas and reached $9 million in sales.[33] In 1968, it opened its first stores outside Arkansas in Sikeston, Missouri and Claremore, Oklahoma.[34]\n\n\n\n### 1969\u20131990: Incorporation and growth as a regional power[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wal-Mart logo from 1966 to 1981\nThe company was incorporated under Delaware General Corporation Law as Wal-Mart, Inc. on October 31, 1969, and changed its name to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. in 1970. The same year, the company opened a home office and first distribution center in Bentonville, Arkansas. It had 38\u00a0 stores operating with 1,500 employees and sales of $44.2\u00a0 million. It began trading stock as a publicly held company on October 1, 1970, and was soon listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The first stock split occurred in May 1971 for $47 per share. By this time, Wal-Mart was operating in five states: Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, and Oklahoma; it entered Tennessee in 1973 and Kentucky and Mississippi in 1974. As the company moved into Texas in 1975, there were 125\u00a0stores with 7,500 employees and total sales of $340.3\u00a0 million.[34]\n\n\n\n![](image)Wal-Mart logo from 1981 to 1992\nIn the 1980s, Wal-Mart briefly experimented with a precursor to the Supercenter, the Hyper-Mart. Four stores combined features of discount stores, supermarkets, pharmacies, video arcades, and other amenities.[35] Wal-Mart continued to grow rapidly, and by the company's 25th anniversary in 1987, there were 1,198 Wal-Mart stores with sales of $15.9\u00a0 billion and 200,000 associates.[34] One reason for Wal-Mart's success between 1980 and 2000 is believed to be its contiguous pattern of expansion over time, building new distribution centers in a hub and spoke framework within driving distance of existing Supercenters.[35]\n\n\nThe company's satellite network was also completed in 1987, a $24\u00a0million investment linking all stores with two-way voice and data transmissions and one-way video communications with the Bentonville office. At the time, the company was the largest private satellite network, allowing the corporate office to track inventory and sales and to instantly communicate with stores.[36] By 1984, Sam Walton had begun to source between 6% and 40% of his company's products from China.[37] In 1988, Walton stepped down as CEO and was replaced by David Glass.[38] Walton remained as chairman of the board. During this year, the first Wal-Mart Supercenter opened in Washington, MO.[39]\n\n\nWith the contribution of its superstores, the company surpassed Toys \"R\" Us in toy sales in 1998.[40][41]\n\n\n\n### 1990\u20132005: Retail rise to multinational status[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wal-Mart logo from 1992 to 2008, still used in some locations and on many semi-truck trailers\nWhile it was the third-largest retailer in the United States, Wal-Mart was more profitable than rivals Kmart and Sears by the late 1980s. By 1990, it became the largest U.S. retailer by revenue.[42][43]\n\n\nPrior to the summer of 1990, Wal-Mart had no presence on the West Coast or in the Northeast (except for a single Sam's Club in New Jersey which opened in November 1989), but in July and October that year, it opened its first stores in California and Pennsylvania, respectively. By the mid-1990s, it was the most powerful retailer in the U.S. and expanded into Mexico in 1991 and Canada in 1994.[44] Wal-Mart stores opened throughout the rest of the U.S., with Vermont being the last state to get a store in 1995.[45]\n\n\nThe company also opened stores outside North America, entering South America in 1995 with stores in Argentina and Brazil; and Europe in July 1999, buying Asda in the United Kingdom for US$10\u00a0billion.[46]\n\n\nIn 1997, Wal-Mart was added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average.[47]\n\n\nIn 1998, Wal-Mart introduced the Neighborhood Market concept with three stores in Arkansas.[48] By 2005, estimates indicate that the company controlled about 20 percent of the retail grocery and consumables business.[49]\n\n\nIn 2000, H. Lee Scott became Wal-Mart's president and CEO as the company's sales increased to $165\u00a0billion.[50] In 2002, it was listed for the first time as America's largest corporation on the Fortune 500 list, with revenues of $219.8\u00a0billion and profits of $6.7\u00a0billion. It has remained there every year except 2006, 2009, and 2012.[51][52][53][54][55][56][57][58][59][60][61][*excessive citations*]\n\n\nIn 2005, Wal-Mart reported US$312.4\u00a0billion in sales, more than 6,200 facilities around the world\u2014including 3,800 stores in the United States and 2,800 elsewhere, employing more than 1.6\u00a0million associates. Its U.S. presence grew so rapidly that only small pockets of the country remained more than 60 miles (97 kilometers) from the nearest store.[62]\n\n\nAs Wal-Mart expanded rapidly into the world's largest corporation, many critics worried about its effect on local communities, particularly small towns with many \"mom and pop\" stores. There have been several studies on the economic impact of Wal-Mart on small towns and local businesses, jobs, and taxpayers. In one, Kenneth Stone, a professor of economics at Iowa State University, found that some small towns can lose almost half of their retail trade within ten years of a Wal-Mart store opening.[63] However, in another study, he compared the changes to what small-town shops had faced in the past\u2014including the development of the railroads, the advent of the Sears Roebuck catalog, and the arrival of shopping malls\u2014and concluded that shop owners who adapt to changes in the retail market can thrive after Wal-Mart arrives.[63] A later study in collaboration with Mississippi State University showed that there are \"both positive and negative impacts on existing stores in the area where the new supercenter locates.\"[64]\n\n\nIn the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in September 2005, Wal-Mart used its logistics network to organize a rapid response to the disaster, donating $20\u00a0million, 1,500 truckloads of merchandise, food for 100,000 meals, and the promise of a job for every one of its displaced workers.[65] An independent study by Steven Horwitz of St. Lawrence University found that Wal-Mart, The Home Depot, and Lowe's made use of their local knowledge about supply chains, infrastructure, decision makers and other resources to provide emergency supplies and reopen stores well before the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) began its response.[66] While the company was overall lauded for its quick response amidst criticism of FEMA, several critics were quick to point out that there still remained issues with the company's labor relations.[67]\n\n\nIn 2006, Charles Fishman published *The Wal-Mart Effect*, examining the operation of Wal-Mart's supply chain. His book caught the attention of the press and the public. Fishman's case studies illustrate Wal-Mart's drive to lower costs and achieve greater efficiency and suggest that it may have significant upstream effects. Since Fishman's book was published, Wal-Mart has more than doubled in size. Further research on Wal-Mart's role in the food supply chain has tended to be limited and anecdotal.[35][68]\n\n\n\n### 2005\u20132010: Initiatives[edit]\n\n\n![Aerial view of dozens of solar panels distributed around the roof of a Walmart store](image)Solar modules mounted on a Walmart Supercenter in Caguas, Puerto Rico (Store #2449)\n#### Environmental initiatives[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2005, Wal-Mart announced several environmental measures to increase energy efficiency and improve its overall environmental record, which had previously been lacking.[69] The company's primary goals included spending $500 million a year to increase fuel efficiency in Wal-Mart's truck fleet by 25 percent over three years and double it within ten; reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent in seven years; reduce energy use at stores by 30 percent; and cut solid waste from U.S. stores and Sam's Clubs by 25 percent in three years. CEO Lee Scott said that Wal-Mart's goal was to be a \"good steward of the environment\" and ultimately use only renewable energy sources and produce zero waste.[70] The company also designed three new experimental stores with wind turbines, photovoltaic solar panels, biofuel-capable boilers, water-cooled refrigerators, and xeriscape gardens.[71] In this time, Wal-Mart also became the biggest seller of organic milk and the biggest buyer of organic cotton in the world, while reducing packaging and energy costs.[69] In 2007, the company worked with outside consultants to discover its total environmental impact and find areas for improvement. Wal-Mart created its own electric company in Texas, named Texas Retail Energy, which planned to supply its stores with cheap power purchased at wholesale prices. Through this new venture, the company expected to save $15 million annually and also to lay the groundwork and infrastructure to sell electricity to Texas consumers in the future.[72]\n\n\n\n#### Branding and store design changes[edit]\n\n\nIn 2006, Wal-Mart announced that it would remodel its U.S. stores to help it appeal to a wider variety of demographics, including more affluent shoppers. As part of the initiative, the company launched a new store in Plano, Texas, that included high-end electronics, jewelry, expensive wines and a sushi bar.[73]\n\n\nOn September 12, 2007, Wal-Mart introduced new advertising with the slogan, \"*Save money. Live better.*\", replacing the previous slogan \"*Always Low Prices, Always*\", which it had used since 1988. Global Insight, which conducted the research that supported the ads, found that Wal-Mart's price level reduction resulted in savings for consumers of $287 billion in 2006, which equated to $957 per person or $2,500 per household (up 7.3 percent from the 2004 savings estimate of $2,329).[74]\n\n\nOn June 30, 2008, Wal-Mart removed the hyphen from its logo and replaced the star with a *Spark* symbol that resembles a sunburst, flower, or star. The store branding became \"Walmart\", with the corporate name remaining with the hyphen as \"Wal-Mart\". The new logo received mixed reviews from design critics who questioned whether the new logo was as bold as those of competitors, such as the Target bullseye, or as instantly recognizable as the previous company's logo, which was used for 18 years.[75] The new logo[76] made its debut on the company's website on July 1, 2008, and its U.S. locations updated store logos in the fall of 2008.[77] Walmart Canada started to adopt the logo for its stores in early 2009.[78]\n\n\n\n#### Acquisitions and employee benefits[edit]\n\n\nOn March 20, 2009, Walmart announced that it was paying a combined US$933.6\u00a0million in bonuses to every full and part-time hourly worker.[79] This was in addition to $788.8 million in profit sharing, 401(k) pension contributions, hundreds of millions of dollars in merchandise discounts, and contributions to the employees' stock purchase plan.[80] While the economy at large was in an ongoing recession, Walmart reported solid financial figures for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2009, with $401.2\u00a0billion in net sales, a gain of 7.2\u00a0percent from the prior year. Income from continuing operations increased 3\u00a0percent to $13.3\u00a0billion, and earnings per share rose 6\u00a0percent to $3.35.[81]\n\n\nOn February 22, 2010, the company confirmed it was acquiring video streaming company Vudu, Inc. for an estimated $100\u00a0million.[82]\n\n\nIn May 2021, Walmart acquired the Israeli startup Zeekit startup for $200 million. Zeekit uses artificial intelligence to allow customers to try on clothing via a dynamic virtual platform.[83]\n\n\n\n### 2011\u20132019[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A truck converted to run on biofuelWalmart's truck fleet logs millions of miles each year, and the company planned to double the fleet's efficiency between 2005 and 2015.[84] The truck pictured is one of 15 based at Walmart's Buckeye, Arizona, distribution center that was converted to run on biofuel from reclaimed cooking grease made during food preparation at Walmart stores.[85]\n\n\nStudies of food choice, dietary quality, and health have found that Supercenters in the United States are associated with increases in obesity rates and average body mass, and that shoppers at Walmart do not follow Dietary Guidelines for Americans as well as shoppers at traditional supermarkets.[35]\nIn January 2011, Walmart announced a program to improve the nutritional value of its store brands over five years, reduce prices for whole foods and vegetables, and open stores in low-income areas, so-called \"food deserts\", where there are no supermarkets.[86] Subsequent research is limited. Walmart may increase food access and decrease food instability, but it does not appear to increase dietary quality.[35]\n\n\nOn April 23, 2011, the company announced that it was testing its new \"Walmart To Go\" home delivery system where customers will be able to order specific items offered on their website. The initial test was in San Jose, California, and the company has not yet said whether the delivery system will be rolled out nationwide.[87]\n\n\nOn November 14, 2012, Walmart launched its first mail subscription service called Goodies. Customers pay a $7 monthly subscription for five to eight delivered food samples each month, so they can try new foods.[88] The service shut down in late 2013.[89]\n\n\nIn August 2013, the firm announced it was in talks to acquire a majority stake in the Kenya-based supermarket chain, Naivas.[90]\n\n\nIn June 2014, some Walmart employees went on strike in major U.S. cities demanding higher wages.[91] In July 2014, American actor and comedian Tracy Morgan launched a lawsuit against Walmart seeking punitive damages over a multi-car pile-up which the suit alleges was caused by the driver of one of the firm's tractor-trailers who had not slept for 24 hours. Morgan's limousine was apparently hit by the trailer, injuring him and two fellow passengers and killing a fourth, fellow comedian James McNair.[92] Walmart settled with the McNair family for $10 million, while admitting no liability.[93] Morgan and Walmart reached a settlement in 2015 for an undisclosed amount,[94] though Walmart later accused its insurers of \"bad faith\" in refusing to pay the settlement.[95]\n\n\nIn 2015, the company closed five stores on short notice for plumbing repairs.[96] However, employees and the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW) alleged some stores were closed in retaliation for strikes aimed at increasing wages and improving working conditions.[97] The UFCW filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board. All five stores have since reopened.[98]\n\n\nIn 2015, Walmart was the biggest US commercial producer of solar power with 142 MW capacity, and had 17 energy storage projects.[99][100] This solar was primarily on rooftops, whereas there is an additional 20,000\u00a0m2 for solar canopies over parking lots.[101]\n\n\n\n![](image)Walmart Supercenter in Grundy, Virginia (Store #3303). This store was built as part of a $200 million revitalization project.[102][103] The store was built on top of a two-story parking garage, the only one of its kind in the United States.[104]\nOn January 15, 2016, Walmart announced it would close 269 stores in 2016, affecting 16,000 workers.[105] One hundred and fifty-four of these stores earmarked for closure were in the U.S. (150 Walmart U.S. stores, 115 Walmart International stores, and 4\u00a0Sam's Clubs). Ninety-five percent of these U.S. stores were located, on average, 10 miles from another Walmart store. The 269 stores represented less than 1\u00a0percent of global square footage and revenue for the company. The 102 locations of Neighborhood Markets that were formerly or originally planned to be Walmart Express, which had been in a pilot program since 2011 and converted in to Neighborhood Markets in 2014, were included in the closures. Walmart planned to focus on \"strengthening Supercenters, optimizing Neighborhood Markets, growing the e-commerce business and expanding pickup services for customers\". In fiscal 2017, the company plans to open between 50 and 60 Supercenters, 85 to 95 Neighborhood Markets, 7 to 10 Sam's Clubs, and 200 to 240 international locations.[106] At the end of fiscal 2017, Walmart opened 38 Supercenters and relocated, expanded or converted 21 discount stores into Supercenters, for a total of 59 Supercenters, and opened 69 Neighborhood Markets, 8 Sam's Clubs, and 173 international locations, and relocated, expanded or converted 4 locations for a total of 177 international locations. On August 8, 2016, Walmart announced a deal to acquire e-commerce website Jet.com for US$3.3 billion.[107][108] Jet.com co-founder and CEO Marc Lore stayed on to run Jet.com in addition to Walmart's existing U.S. e-commerce operation. The acquisition was structured as a payout of $3 billion in cash, and an additional $300 million in Walmart stock vested over time as part of an incentive bonus plan for Jet.com executives.[109] On October 19, 2016, Walmart announced it would partner with IBM and Tsinghua University to track the pork supply chain in China using blockchain.[110] The use of blockchain to automate the tracking of the supply chain promises the potential for Walmart to save money and thus increase profits.[111]\n\n\nOn February 15, 2017, Walmart announced the acquisition of Moosejaw, a leading online active outdoor retailer, for approximately $51 million. The acquisition closed on February 13, 2017.[112] On June 16, 2017, Walmart agreed to acquire the men's apparel company Bonobos for $310 million in an effort to expand its fashion holdings.[113] On September 29, 2017, Walmart acquired Parcel, a technology-based, same-day and last-mile delivery company in Brooklyn.[114] In 2018, Walmart started crowdsourcing delivery services to customers using drivers' private vehicles, under the brand \"Spark\".[115]\n\n\nOn December 6, 2017, Walmart announced that it would change its corporate name to Walmart Inc. from Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. effective February 1, 2018.[116][117]\n\n\nOn January 11, 2018, Walmart announced that 63 Sam's Club locations in cities including Memphis, Houston, Seattle, and others would be closing. Some of the stores had already liquidated, without notifying employees; some employees learned by a company-wide email delivered January 11. All of the 63 stores were gone from the Sam's Club website as of the morning of January 11. Walmart said that ten of the stores will become e-commerce distribution centers and employees can reapply to work at those locations. *Business Insider* magazine calculated that over 11,000 workers will be affected.[118][119] On the same day, Walmart announced that as a result of the new tax law, it would be raising Walmart starting wages, distributing bonuses, expanding its leave policies and contributing toward the cost of employees' adoptions. Doug McMillon, Walmart's CEO, said, \"We are early in the stages of assessing the opportunities tax reform creates for us to invest in our customers and associates and to further strengthen our business, all of which should benefit our shareholders.\"[120]\n\n\nIn March 2018, Walmart announced that it is producing its own brand of meal kits in all of its stores that is priced under Blue Apron designed to serve two people.[121]\n\n\nIt was reported that Walmart is now looking at entering the subscription-video space, hoping to compete with Netflix and Amazon. They have enlisted the help of former Epix CEO, Mark Greenberg, to help develop a low-cost subscription video-streaming service.[122]\n\n\nIn September 2018, Walmart partnered with comedian and talk show host Ellen DeGeneres to launch a new brand of women's apparel and accessories called EV1.[123]\n\n\nOn February 26, 2019, Walmart announced that it had acquired Tel Aviv-based product review start-up Aspectiva for an undisclosed sum.[124]\n\n\nIn May 2019, Walmart announced the launch of free one-day shipping on more than 220,000 items with minimum purchase amount of $35.[125] The initiative first launched in Las Vegas and the Phoenix area.[126]\n\n\nIn September 2019, Walmart made the announcement that it would cease the sale of all e-cigarettes due to \"regulatory complexity and uncertainty\" over the products. Earlier in 2019, Walmart stopped selling fruit-flavored e-cigarette and had raised the minimum age to 21 for the purchase of products containing tobacco.[127] That same month, Walmart opened its first Health Center, a \"medical mall\" where customers can purchase primary care services, such as vision tests, dental exams and root canals, lab work, X-rays and EKGs, counseling, and fitness and diet classes. Prices without insurance were listed, for instance, at $30 for an annual physical and $45 for a counseling session.[128] Continuing with its health care initiative, they opened a 2,600 square feet (240\u00a0m2) health and wellness clinic prototype in Springdale, Arkansas just to expand services.[129]\n\n\nAs of October 2019, Walmart stopped selling all live fish and aquatic plants.[130]\n\n\n\n### 2020s: Continuing growth and development[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Signs on a Walmart indicated changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic forced store closures, limited store occupancy, large-scale employee dismissal, and the enforcement of social distancing protocols for Walmart and many other companies. Store hours were adjusted to allow cleaning and stocking.\n\n\nIn March 2020, due to the pandemic, Walmart changed some of its employee benefits. Employees can now decide to stay home and take unpaid leave if they feel unable to work or uncomfortable coming to work. Additionally, Walmart employees who contract the virus will receive \"up to two weeks of pay\". After two weeks, hourly associates who are unable to return to work are eligible for up to 26 weeks in pay.[131] As of July 21, 2020, Walmart paid pandemic bonuses of $428 million to staff. People who did part-time or temporary work received a bonus of $150 while those who worked full-time received a bonus of $300.[132] In July 2020, Walmart announced that all customers would be required to wear masks in all stores nationwide, including Sam's Club.[133]\n\n\nIn the first quarter of 2020, consumers responded to COVID by shopping less frequently (5.6% fewer transactions), and buying more when they did shop (16.5%).[134] As people shifted from eating out to eating at home,[35] net sales at Walmart increased by 10.5%, while online sales rose by 74%. Although Walmart experienced a 5.5% increase in operating expenses, its net income increased by 3.9%.[134] In the third quarter of 2020, ending October 31, Walmart reported revenue of $134.7 billion, representing a year-on-year increase of 5.2 percent.[135]\n\n\nIn December 2020, Walmart launched a new service, Carrier Pickup, that allows the customers to schedule a return for a product bought online, in-store, or from a third-party vendor. These services can be initiated on the Walmart App or on the website.[136]\n\n\nIn January 2021, Walmart announced that the company is launching a fintech startup, with venture partner Ribbit Capital, to provide financial products for consumers and employees.[137]\n\n\nIn February 2021, Walmart acquired technology from Thunder Industries, which uses automation to create digital ads, to expand its online marketing capabilities.[138]\n\n\nIn August 2021, Walmart announced it would open its Spark crowdsource delivery to other businesses as a white-label service, competing with Postmates and online food ordering delivery companies.[115]\n\n\nIn December 2021, Walmart announced it will participate in the Stephens Investment Conference Wednesday, and the Morgan Stanley Virtual Global Consumer & Retail Conference.[139] In June 2022, Walmart announced it would be acquiring Memomi, an AR optical tech company.[140]\n\n\nIn August 2022, Walmart announced it would be acquiring Volt Systems, a vendor management and product tracking software company.[141] Walmart announced it was partnering with Paramount to offer Paramount+ content\nto its Walmart+ subscribers in a bid to better compete with Amazon.[142]\n\n\nWalmart announced in August 2022 that locations were not going back to 24 hours with most stores now being open between 6am and 11pm.[143]\n\n\nIn January 2023, Walmart announced it would raise its minimum wage for U.S. hourly workers from $12 to $14 an hour. Approximately 340,000 employees are expected to receive a raise, effective in early March 2023, and Walmart's U.S. average wage is expected to be over $17.50. The company also announced it would be adding additional college degrees and certificates to its Live Better U program.[144]\n\n\nIn February 2023, Walmart announced that they had made $611.3 billion in sales in the previous financial year, up 6.7%, which included a bump in the fourth quarter of the year, which saw $164 billion in sales. Profits for the company were also up, almost doubled from the previous year.[145]\n\n\nIn April 2023, the company announced it would add electric vehicle charging stations at thousands of stores by 2030, which would be on top of the almost 1,300 existing stations that were in operation at 280 company locations at the time of the announcement. *CNBC* noted that the company stated it had more than 4,700 stores and 600 Sam Club's stores that were located within 10 miles of roughly 90% of Americans.[146]\n\n\n\n## Operating divisions[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of assets owned by Walmart\n\n![](image)Map of countries with Walmart stores   \nLegend: Current market locations\n Former market locations\n No current market locations\n\nAs of 2016, Walmart's operations are organized into four divisions: Walmart U.S., Walmart International, Sam's Club and Global eCommerce.[147] In the United States, Walmart's stores operate in four formats: discount, Supercenters. Neighborhood Markets, and Sam's Club stores.[35] Walmart International stores include additional formats such as supermarkets, hypermarkets, cash-and-carry stores, home improvement, specialty electronics, restaurants, apparel stores, drugstores, and convenience stores.[148]\n\n\n\n### Walmart U.S.[edit]\n\n\n* ![Walmart in Fajardo, Puerto Rico](image)\n\nWalmart in Fajardo, Puerto Rico\n\n\n**Walmart U.S.** is the company's largest division, accounting for US$331.666\u00a0billion, or 65 percent of total sales, for fiscal 2019.[16][17] It consists of three retail formats that have become commonplace in the United States: Supercenters, Discount Stores, Neighborhood Markets, and other small formats. The discount stores sell a variety of mostly non-grocery products, though emphasis has now shifted towards supercenters, which include more groceries. As of October\u00a031, 2022,[update] there are a total of 4,720 Walmart U.S. stores.[2][3] In the United States, 90 percent of the population resides within 10 miles of a Walmart store.[149] The total number of Walmart U.S. stores and Sam's Clubs combined is 5,320.[2][3]\n\n\nThe president and CEO of Walmart U.S. is John Furner.[150][151]\n\n\n\n#### Walmart Supercenter[edit]\n\n\n![A Walmart Supercenter store](image)A Walmart Supercenter in Windham, Connecticut (Store #2022)\n**Walmart Supercenters**, branded simply as \"Walmart\", are hypermarkets with sizes varying from 69,000 to 260,000 square feet (6,400 to 24,200 square meters), but averaging about 178,000 square feet (16,500 square meters).[4] These stock general merchandise and a full-service supermarket, including meat and poultry, baked goods, delicatessen, frozen foods, dairy products, garden produce, and fresh seafood. Many Walmart Supercenters also have a garden center, pet shop, pharmacy, Tire & Lube Express, optical center, one-hour photo processing lab, portrait studio, and numerous alcove shops, such as cellular phone stores, hair and nail salons, video rental stores, local bank branches (such as Woodforest National Bank branches in newer locations), and fast food outlets.\n\n\nMany Walmart Supercenters currently feature McDonald's or Subway restaurants. In some Canadian locations, Tim Hortons were opened. Recently, in several Supercenters, like the Tallahassee, Florida and the Palm Desert, California locations, Walmart added Burger King to their locations, and the location in Glen Burnie, Maryland, due to its past as a hypermarket called Leedmark, which operated from May 1991 to January 1994, boasts an Auntie Anne's and an Italian restaurant. Some Walmart locations in Canada have Axess Law locations, Mary Brown's, Burger King and McDonald's, and Atlantic Lottery Corporation locations in the Atlantic region. Some US locations have Wendy's, Domino's, Taco Bell, Claire's, and small arcades called GamePlay.\n\n\nSome locations also have fuel stations which sell gasoline distributed by Murphy USA (which spun off from Murphy Oil in 2013), Sunoco (\"Optima\"), the Tesoro Corporation (\"Mirastar\"), USA Gasoline, and even now Walmart-branded gas stations.[152]\n\n\nThe first Supercenter opened in Washington, Missouri, in 1988. A similar concept, Hypermart USA, had opened a year earlier in Garland, Texas. All Hypermart USA stores were later closed or converted into Supercenters.\n\n\nAs of October\u00a031, 2022,[update] there were 3,572 Walmart Supercenters in 49 of the 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.[2][3] Hawaii is the only state to not have a Supercenter location. The largest Supercenter in the world, covering 260,000 square feet (24,000 square meters) on two floors, is located in Crossgates Commons in Albany, New York.[153]\n\n\nA typical supercenter sells approximately 120,000 items, compared to the 35 million products sold in Walmart's online store.[154]\n\n\nThe \"Supercenter\" name has since been phased out, with these stores now simply referred to as \"Walmart\", since the company introduced the new Walmart logo in 2008. However, the branding is still used in Walmart's Canadian stores (spelled as \"Supercentre\" in Canadian English).[155]\n\n\n\n#### Walmart Discount Store[edit]\n\n\n![The exterior of a Walmart Discount Store in Charlotte, North Carolina](image)The exterior of a Walmart Discount Store in Charlotte, North Carolina (Store #1821)\n**Walmart Discount Stores**, also branded as simply \"Walmart\", are discount department stores with sizes varying from 30,000 to 221,000 square feet (2,800 to 20,500 square meters), with the average store covering 105,000 square feet (9,800 square meters).[4] They carry general merchandise and limited groceries. Some newer and remodeled discount stores have an expanded grocery department, similar to Target's PFresh department. Many of these stores also feature a garden center, pharmacy, Tire & Lube Express, optical center, one-hour photo processing lab, portrait studio, a bank branch, a cell phone store, and a fast food outlet. Some also have gasoline stations.[152] Discount Stores were Walmart's original concept, though they have since been surpassed by Supercenters.[35]\n\n\nIn 1990, Walmart opened its first Bud's Discount City location in Bentonville. Bud's operated as a closeout store, much like Big Lots. Many locations were opened to fulfill leases in shopping centers as Walmart stores left and moved into newly built Supercenters. All of the Bud's Discount City stores had closed or converted into Walmart Discount Stores by 1997.[156]\n\n\nAt its peak in 1996, there were 1,995 Walmart Discount Stores;[157] as of October 31, 2022, that number was dropped to 365.[2][3]\n\n\n\n#### Walmart Neighborhood Market[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A 24-hour Walmart Neighborhood Market in Valdosta, Georgia (Store #6732)\n**Walmart Neighborhood Market**, sometimes branded as \"Neighborhood Market by Walmart\" or informally known as \"Neighborhood Walmart\",[158] is Walmart's chain of supermarkets ranging from 28,000 to 65,000 square feet (2,600 to 6,000 square meters) and averaging about 42,000 square feet (3,900 square meters), about a fifth of the size of a Walmart Supercenter.[4][159] The first Walmart Neighborhood Market opened ten years after the first Supercenter opened, but Walmart did not focus on the smaller grocery store format until the 2010s.[160]\n\n\nThe stores focus on three of Walmart's major sales categories: groceries, which account for about 55 percent of the company's revenue,[161][162] pharmacy, and, at some stores, fuel.[163] For groceries and consumables, the stores sell fresh produce, deli and bakery items, prepared foods, meat, dairy, organic, general grocery and frozen foods, in addition to cleaning products and pet supplies.[159][164] Some stores offer wine and beer sales[159] and drive-through pharmacies. Some stores, such as one at Midtown Center in Bentonville, Arkansas, offer made-to-order pizza with a seating area for eating.[165] Customers can also use Walmart's site-to-store operation and pick up online orders at Walmart Neighborhood Market stores just like the Supercenters and Discount Stores[166]\n\n\nProducts at Walmart Neighborhood Market stores have the same prices as those at Walmart's larger supercenters. A Moody's Investors Services analyst said the wider company's pricing structure gives the chain of grocery stores a \"competitive advantage\" over competitors Whole Foods Market, Kroger and Trader Joe's.[163]\n\n\nNeighborhood Market stores expanded slowly at first as a way to fill gaps between Walmart Supercenters and Discount Stores in existing markets. In its first 12 years, the company opened about 180 Walmart Neighborhood Markets. By 2010, Walmart said it was ready to accelerate its expansion plans for the grocery stores.[167] As of October\u00a031, 2022,[update] there were 682 Walmart Neighborhood Markets,[2][3] each employing between 90 and 95 full-time and part-time workers.[168] The total number of Neighborhood Markets and other small formats combined is 783.\n\n\nDepending on the area, Neighborhood Market has some competition with Hy-Vee, which launched in 2019, similar to Neighborhood Market.\n\n\n\n#### Former stores and concepts[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Walmart Neighborhood Market originally planned to be a Walmart Express in Alma, Georgia in September 2015 (Store #4229). This location closed in 2016 as part of a plan to close 269 stores globally.\nWalmart opened **Supermercado de Walmart** locations to appeal to Hispanic communities in the United States.[169] The first one, a 39,000-square-foot (3,600-square-meter) store in the Spring Branch area of Houston, opened on April 29, 2009.[170] The store was a conversion of an existing Walmart Neighborhood Market.[171] In 2009, another Supermercado de Walmart opened in Phoenix, Arizona.[172] Both locations closed in 2014.[173] In 2009, Walmart opened \"M\u00e1s Club\", a warehouse retail operation patterned after Sam's Club. Its lone store also closed in 2014.[170]\n\n\n**Walmart Express** was a chain of smaller discount stores with a range of services from groceries to check cashing and gasoline service. The concept was focused on small towns deemed unable to support a larger store and large cities where space was at a premium. Walmart planned to build 15 to 20 Walmart Express stores, focusing on Arkansas, North Carolina, and Chicago, by the end of its fiscal year in January 2012. As of September\u00a02014,[update] Walmart re-branded all 22[174] of its Express format stores to Neighborhood Markets in an effort to streamline its retail offer. It continued to open new Express stores under the Neighborhood Market name. As of October\u00a031, 2022,[update] there were 101 small-format stores in the United States. These include 92 other small formats, 8 convenience stores and 1 pickup location.[2][3] On January 15, 2016, Walmart announced that it would be closing 269 stores globally, including the 102 Neighborhood Markets that were formerly or originally planned to be Express stores.[175]\n\n\nBetween 2002 and 2022, Walmart owned the Amigo supermarkets chain in Puerto Rico. In 2022, Walmart announced that it would sell its Amigo stores to Pueblo Inc. and focus on modernizing its 18 Supercenter and Division 1 formats and seven Sam's Clubs stores.[176]\n\n\n\n#### Initiatives[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2006, Walmart announced a pilot program to sell generic drugs at $4\u00a0per prescription. The program was launched at stores in the Tampa, Florida, area, and by January 2007 had been expanded to all stores in Florida. While the average price of generics is\u00a0$29 per prescription, compared to\u00a0$102 for name-brand drugs, Walmart maintains that it is not selling at a loss, or providing them as an act of charity\u2014instead, they are using the same mechanisms of mass distribution that it uses to bring lower prices to other products.[177] Many of Walmart's low cost generics are imported from India, where they are made by drug makers that include Ranbaxy Laboratories and Cipla.[178]\n\n\nOn February 6, 2007, the company launched a \"beta\" version of a movie download service, which sold about 3,000 films and television episodes from all major studios and television networks.[179] The service was discontinued on December 21, 2007, due to low sales.[180]\n\n\nIn 2008, Walmart started a pilot program in the small grocery store concept called Marketside in the metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona area. The four stores closed in 2011.[181]\n\n\n\n![](image)A Walmart Pickup location in Canada\nIn 2015, Walmart began testing a free grocery pickup service, allowing customers to select products online and choose their pickup time. At the store, a Walmart employee loads the groceries into the customer's car. As of December\u00a017, 2017,[update] the service is available in 39 U.S. states.[182]\n\n\nIn May 2016, Walmart announced a change to ShippingPass, its three-day shipping service, and that it will move from a three-day delivery to two-day delivery to remain competitive with Amazon.[183] Walmart priced it at 49 dollars per year, compared to Amazon Prime's 99-dollar-per-year price.[184][185]\n\n\nIn June 2016, Walmart and Sam's Club announced that they would begin testing a last-mile grocery delivery that used services including Uber, Lyft, and Deliv, to bring customers' orders to their homes. Walmart customers would be able to shop using the company's online grocery service at grocery.walmart.com, then request delivery at checkout for a small fee. The first tests were planned to go live in Denver and Phoenix.[186] Walmart announced on March 14, 2018, that it would expand online delivery to 100 metropolitan regions in the United States, the equivalent of 40 percent of households, by the end of the year of 2018.[187]\n\n\nWalmart's Winemakers Selection private label wine was introduced in June 2018 in about 1,100 stores. The wine, from domestic and international sources, was described by *Washington Post* food and wine columnist Dave McIntyre as notably good for the inexpensive ($11 to $16 per bottle) price level.[188]\n\n\nIn October 2019, Walmart announced that customers in 2,000 locations in 29 states can use the grocery pickup service for their adult beverage purchases. Walmart will also deliver adult beverages from nearly 200 stores across California and Florida.[189]\n\n\nIn February 2020, Walmart announced a new membership program called, \"Walmart +\". The news came shortly after Walmart announced the discontinuation of its personal shopping service, Jetblack.[190][191]\n\n\n\n#### Numbers of stores by state[edit]\n\n\nLocations as of October 1, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n| State | Supercenters | DiscountStores | NeighborhoodMarkets | Amigos | Sam'sClubs | OtherPharmacyFormats | Totalstores\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Alabama[192] | 101\n | 1\n | 28\n |  | 13\n | 1\n | 144\n |\n| Alaska[193] | 7\n | 2\n |  |  |  |  | 9\n |\n| Arizona[194] | 84\n | 2\n | 26\n |  | 12\n |  | 124\n |\n| Arkansas[195] | 76\n | 5\n | 33\n |  | 11\n | 8\n | 133\n |\n| California[196] | 144\n | 68\n | 66\n |  | 30\n | 1\n | 309\n |\n| Colorado[197] | 70\n | 4\n | 14\n |  | 17\n |  | 105\n |\n| Connecticut[198] | 12\n | 21\n |  |  | 1\n |  | 34\n |\n| Delaware[199] | 6\n | 3\n |  |  | 1\n |  | 10\n |\n| District of Columbia[200] | 3\n |  |  |  |  |  | 3\n |\n| Florida[201] | 232\n | 9\n | 98\n |  | 46\n | 2\n | 387\n |\n| Georgia[202] | 154\n | 2\n | 31\n |  | 24\n | 4\n | 215\n |\n| Hawaii[203] |  | 10\n |  |  | 2\n |  | 12\n |\n| Idaho[204] | 23\n |  | 3\n |  | 1\n |  | 27\n |\n| Illinois[205] | 139\n | 15\n | 5\n |  | 25\n |  | 184\n |\n| Indiana[206] | 97\n | 6\n | 9\n |  | 13\n | 2\n | 127\n |\n| Iowa[207] | 58\n | 2\n |  |  | 9\n |  | 69\n |\n| Kansas[208] | 58\n | 2\n | 14\n |  | 9\n |  | 83\n |\n| Kentucky[209] | 77\n | 7\n | 7\n |  | 9\n | 1\n | 101\n |\n| Louisiana[210] | 88\n | 2\n | 33\n |  | 14\n | 1\n | 138\n |\n| Maine[211] | 19\n | 3\n |  |  | 3\n |  | 25\n |\n| Maryland[212] | 31\n | 16\n |  |  | 11\n | 2\n | 60\n |\n| Massachusetts[213] | 27\n | 21\n |  |  |  |  | 48\n |\n| Michigan[214] | 90\n | 3\n |  |  | 23\n | 1\n | 117\n |\n| Minnesota[215] | 65\n | 3\n |  |  | 12\n |  | 80\n |\n| Mississippi[216] | 65\n | 3\n | 10\n |  | 7\n | 1\n | 86\n |\n| Missouri[217] | 112\n | 9\n | 16\n |  | 19\n |  | 156\n |\n| Montana[218] | 14\n |  |  |  | 2\n |  | 16\n |\n| Nebraska[219] | 35\n |  | 7\n |  | 5\n |  | 47\n |\n| Nevada[220] | 30\n | 2\n | 11\n |  | 7\n |  | 50\n |\n| New Hampshire[221] | 19\n | 7\n |  |  | 2\n |  | 28\n |\n| New Jersey[222] | 35\n | 27\n |  |  | 8\n |  | 70\n |\n| New Mexico[223] | 35\n | 2\n | 9\n |  | 7\n |  | 53\n |\n| New York[224] | 82\n | 16\n | 1\n |  | 12\n |  | 111\n |\n| North Carolina[225] | 143\n | 6\n | 43\n |  | 22\n |  | 214\n |\n| North Dakota[226] | 14\n |  |  |  | 3\n |  | 17\n |\n| Ohio[227] | 138\n | 5\n |  |  | 27\n |  | 170\n |\n| Oklahoma[228] | 81\n | 7\n | 33\n |  | 13\n |  | 134\n |\n| Oregon[229] | 29\n | 7\n | 9\n |  |  |  | 45\n |\n| Pennsylvania[230] | 116\n | 20\n |  |  | 24\n |  | 160\n |\n| Puerto Rico[231] | 13\n | 5\n |  | 11\n | 7\n |  | 36\n |\n| Rhode Island[232] | 5\n | 4\n |  |  |  |  | 9\n |\n| South Carolina[233] | 83\n |  | 26\n |  | 13\n |  | 122\n |\n| South Dakota[234] | 15\n |  |  |  | 2\n |  | 17\n |\n| Tennessee[235] | 117\n | 1\n | 18\n |  | 14\n |  | 150\n |\n| Texas[236] | 391\n | 18\n | 97\n |  | 82\n | 5\n | 593\n |\n| Utah[237] | 41\n |  | 10\n |  | 8\n |  | 59\n |\n| Vermont[238] | 3\n | 3\n |  |  |  |  | 6\n |\n| Virginia[239] | 110\n | 4\n | 20\n |  | 15\n |  | 149\n |\n| Washington[240] | 52\n | 9\n | 4\n |  |  |  | 65\n |\n| West Virginia[241] | 38\n |  |  |  | 5\n | 1\n | 44\n |\n| Wisconsin[242] | 83\n | 4\n | 2\n |  | 10\n |  | 99\n |\n| Wyoming[243] | 12\n |  |  |  | 2\n |  | 14\n |\n\n\n### Walmart International[edit]\n\n\nAs of October\u00a031, 2022,[update] Walmart's international operations comprised 5,266 stores[2][3] and 800,000 workers in 23\u00a0countries outside the United States.[244] There are wholly owned operations in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, and the UK. With 2.2\u00a0million employees worldwide, the company is the largest private employer in the U.S. and Mexico, and one of the largest in Canada.[8] In fiscal 2019 Walmart's international division sales were US$120.824\u00a0billion, or 23.7\u00a0percent of total sales.[16][17] International retail units range from 1,400 to 186,000 square feet (130 to 17,280 square meters), while wholesale units range from 24,000 to 158,000 square feet (2,200 to 14,700 square meters).[4] Judith McKenna is the president and CEO of Walmart International .[245][151]\n\n\n\n#### Central America[edit]\n\n\nWalmart also owns 51\u00a0percent of the Central American Retail Holding Company (CARHCO), which, as of October\u00a031, 2022,[update] consists of 868 stores, including 263 stores in Guatemala (under the Paiz [27 locations], Walmart Supercenter [10 locations], Despensa Familiar [181 locations], and Maxi Dispensa [45 locations] banners),[2][3] 102 stores in El Salvador (under the Despensa Familiar [63 locations], La Despensa de Don Juan [17 locations], Walmart Supercenter [6 locations], and Maxi Despensa [16 locations] banners),[2][3] 111 stores in Honduras (including the Paiz [8 locations], Walmart Supercenter [4 locations], Dispensa Familiar [71 locations], and Maxi Despensa [28 locations] banners),[2][3] 102 stores in Nicaragua (including the Pali [71 locations], La Uni\u00f3n [9 locations], Maxi Pali [20 locations], and Walmart Supercenter [2\u00a0locations] banners),[2][3] and 290 stores in Costa Rica (including the Maxi Pali [49 locations], Mas X Menos [38 locations], Walmart Supercenter [14\u00a0locations], and Pali [189 locations] banners[2][3]).[246]\n\n\n\n#### Chile[edit]\n\n\nMain article: L\u00edder\n\nIn January 2009, the company acquired a controlling interest in the largest grocer in Chile, Distribuci\u00f3n y Servicio D&S SA.[247][248] In 2010, the company was renamed Walmart Chile.[249] As of October\u00a031, 2022,[update] Walmart Chile operates 384 stores under the banners Lider Hiper (97 locations), Lider Express (154 locations), Superbodega Acuenta (122 locations), and Central Mayorista (11 locations).[2][3]\n\n\n\n#### Mexico[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Walmart de M\u00e9xico y Centroam\u00e9rica\n\n![](image)Walmart in Mexico\nWalmart opened its first international store in Mexico in 1991.[35]\nAs of October\u00a031, 2022,[update] Walmart's Mexico division, the largest outside the U.S., consisted of 2,804 stores.[2][3] Walmart in Mexico operates Walmart Supercenter (300 locations), Sam's Club (167 locations), Bodega Aurrera (571 locations), Mi Bodega Aurrera (438 locations), Bodega Aurrera Express (1,229 locations) and Walmart Express (99 locations).[3]\n\n\n\n#### Canada[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Walmart Canada\n\n![](image)Walmart Supercentre in Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada in September 2017\nWalmart has operated in Canada since it acquired 122\u00a0stores comprising the Woolco division of Woolworth Canada, Inc on January 14, 1994.[250] As of October\u00a031, 2022,[update] it operates 402\u00a0locations (including 343\u00a0supercentres and 59 discount stores)[2][3] and, as of June\u00a02015,[update] it employs 89,358 people, with a local home office in Mississauga, Ontario.[251] Walmart Canada's first three Supercentres (spelled in Canadian English) opened in November 2006 in Ancaster, London, and Stouffville, Ontario.[252] The 100th\u00a0Canadian Supercentre opened in July 2010, in Victoria, British Columbia.\n\n\nIn 2010, approximately one year after its incorporation of Schedule 2 (foreign-owned, deposit-taking) of Canada's *Bank Act*,[253] Walmart Canada Bank was introduced with the launch of the Walmart (Canada) Rewards MasterCard.[254] Less than ten years later, however, on May 17, 2018, Wal-Mart Canada announced it had reached a definitive agreement to sell Wal-Mart Canada Bank to First National co-founder Stephen Smith and private equity firm Centerbridge Partners, L.P., on undisclosed financial terms, though it added that it would still be issuer of the Walmart (Canada) Rewards MasterCard.[255]\n\n\nOn April 1, 2019, Centerbridge Partners, L.P. and Stephen Smith jointly announced the closing of the previously announced acquisition of Wal-Mart Canada Bank and that it was to be renamed Duo Bank of Canada, to be styled simply as Duo Bank.[256][257] Though exact ownership percentages were never revealed in either company announcement, it has also since been revealed that Duo Bank was reclassified as a Schedule 1 (domestic, deposit-taking)[258][259] federally chartered bank of the *Bank Act* in Canada from the Schedule 2 (foreign-owned or -controlled, deposit-taking)[259] that it had been, which indicates that Stephen Smith, as a noted Canadian businessman, is in a controlling position.\n\n\n\n#### Africa[edit]\n\n\nOn September 28, 2010, Walmart announced it would buy Massmart Holdings Ltd. of Johannesburg, South Africa in a deal worth over US$4\u00a0billion giving the company its first footprint in Africa.[260] As of October\u00a031, 2022,[update] it has 411 stores, including 361 stores in South Africa (under the banners Game Foodco [78 locations], CBW [41 locations], Game [39 locations], Builders Express [50 locations], Builders Warehouse [34 locations], Cambridge [42 locations], Rhino [15 locations], Makro [23 locations], Builders Trade Depot [8 locations], Jumbo [13 locations], and Builders Superstore [18 locations]),[2][3] 11 stores in Botswana (under the banners CBW [7 locations], Game Foodco

Tanzania (under the Game Foodco banner),[2][3] 1 store in Uganda (under the Game banner),[2][3] and 7 stores in Zambia (under the banners CBW [1 location], Game Foodco [3 locations], Builders Warehouse [2 locations], and Builders Express [1 location]).[2][3]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### China[edit]\n\n\n![An aisle in a Walmart store in China](image)A Walmart in Hangzhou, China in February 2017\nWalmart has joint ventures in China and several majority-owned subsidiaries. As of October\u00a031, 2022,[update] Walmart China (\u6c83\u5c14\u739b *W\u00f2'\u0113rm\u01ce*)[261] operates 369 stores under the Walmart Supercenter (330 locations) and Sam's Club (39 locations) banners.[2][3]\n\n\nIn February 2012, Walmart announced that the company raised its stake to 51 percent in Chinese online supermarket Yihaodian to tap rising consumer wealth and help the company offer more products. Walmart took full ownership in July 2015.[262]\n\n\nIn December 2021, the Chinese Communist Party's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection warned Walmart about not stocking products made from inputs from Xinjiang in response to the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act.[263]\n\n\n\n#### India[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2006, the company announced a joint venture with Bharti Enterprises to operate in India. As foreign corporations were not allowed to enter the retail sector directly, Walmart operated through franchises and handled the wholesale end of the business.[264] The partnership involved two joint ventures\u2014Bharti manages the front end, involving opening of retail outlets while Walmart takes care of the back end, such as cold chains and logistics. Walmart operates stores in India under the name Best Price Modern Wholesale.[265] The first store opened in Amritsar on May 30, 2009. On September 14, 2012, the Government of India approved 51 percent FDI in multi-brand retails, subject to approval by individual states, effective September 20, 2012.[266][267] Scott Price, Walmart's president and CEO for Asia, told *The Wall Street Journal* that the company would be able to start opening Walmart stores in India within two years.[268] Expansion into India faced some significant problems. In November 2012, Walmart admitted to spending US$25\u00a0million lobbying the Indian National Congress;[269] lobbying is conventionally considered bribery in India.[270] Walmart is conducting an internal investigation into potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.[271] Bharti Walmart suspended a number of employees, rumored to include its CFO and legal team, to ensure \"a complete and thorough investigation\".[272] In October 2013, Bharti and Walmart separated to pursue business independently.[273]\n\n\nOn May 9, 2018, Walmart announced its intent to acquire a 77% majority stake in the Indian e-commerce company Flipkart for $16\u00a0billion, in a deal that was completed on August 18, 2018.[274][275][276] As of October\u00a031, 2022,[update] there are 28 Best Price Modern Wholesale locations.[2][3]\n\n\n\n#### Setbacks[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1990s, Walmart tried with a large financial investment to get a foothold in both German and Indonesian retail markets.\n\n\nWalmart entered Indonesia with the opening of stores in Lippo Supermall (now known as Supermal Karawaci) and Megamall Pluit (now known as Pluit Village) respectively, under a joint-venture agreement with local conglomerate Lippo Group. Both stores closed down due to the 1997 Asian financial crisis.[277][278][279]\n\n\nIn 1997, Walmart took over the supermarket chain Wertkauf with its 21 stores for DM 750 million[280] and the following year Walmart acquired 74 Interspar stores for DM 1.3 billion.[281][282] The German market at this point was an oligopoly with high competition among companies which used a similar low price strategy as Walmart. As a result, Walmart's low price strategy yielded no competitive advantage. Walmart's corporate culture was not viewed positively among employees and customers, particularly Walmart's \"statement of ethics\", which attempted to restrict relationships between employees, a possible violation of German labor law, and led to a public discussion in the media, resulting in a bad reputation among customers.[283][284] In July 2006, Walmart announced its withdrawal from Germany due to sustained losses. The stores were sold to the German company Metro during Walmart's fiscal third quarter.[285][286] Walmart did not disclose its losses from its German investment, but they were estimated to be around \u20ac3\u00a0billion.[287]\n\n\n\n![](image)A Hiper Bompre\u00e7o in Natal, Brazil in May 2008\nIn 2004, Walmart bought the 118\u00a0stores in the Bompre\u00e7o supermarket chain in northeastern Brazil. In late 2005, it took control of the Brazilian operations of Sonae Distribution Group through its new subsidiary, WMS Supermercados do Brasil, thus acquiring control of the Nacional and Mercadorama supermarket chains, the leaders in the Rio Grande do Sul and Paran\u00e1 states, respectively. None of these stores were rebranded. As of January\u00a02014,[update] Walmart operated 61 Bompre\u00e7o supermarkets, 39\u00a0Hiper Bompre\u00e7o stores. It also ran 57\u00a0Walmart Supercenters, 27\u00a0Sam's Clubs, and 174 Todo Dia stores. With the acquisition of Bompre\u00e7o and Sonae, by 2010, Walmart was the third-largest supermarket chain in Brazil, behind Carrefour and P\u00e3o de A\u00e7\u00facar.[288]\n\n\nWalmart Brasil, the operating company, has its head office in Barueri, S\u00e3o Paulo State, and regional offices in Curitiba, Paran\u00e1; Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul; Recife, Pernambuco; and Salvador, Bahia.[289] Walmart Brasil operates under the banners Todo Dia, Nacional, Bompre\u00e7o, Walmart Supercenter, Maxxi Atacado, Hipermercado Big, Hiper Bompre\u00e7o, Sam's Club, Mercadorama, Walmart Posto (Gas Station), Supermercado Todo Dia, and Hiper Todo Dia. Recently, the company started the conversion process of all Hiper Bompre\u00e7o and Big stores into Walmart Supercenters and Bompre\u00e7o, Nacional and Mercadorama stores into the Walmart Supermercado brand.\n\n\nSince August 2018, Walmart Inc. only holds a minority stake in Walmart Brasil, which was renamed Grupo Big on August 12, 2019,[290] with 20% of the company's shares, and private equity firm Advent International holding 80% ownership of the company.[291] On March 24, 2021, it was announced that Carrefour would be acquiring Grupo Big.[292]\n\n\n\n![](image)A Walmart Supercenter in Argentina in February 2019\nWalmart Argentina was founded in 1995 and operates stores under the banners Walmart Supercenter, Changomas, Mi Changomas, and Punto Mayorista. On November 6, 2020, it was announced that Walmart has sold its Argentine operations to Grupo de Narv\u00e1ez and renamed Hiper Changomas.[293]\n\n\n\n![](image)ASDA Supermarket in Fife, Scotland\nWalmart's UK subsidiary Asda (which retained its name after being acquired by Walmart) is based in Leeds and accounted for 42.7\u00a0 percent of 2006 sales of Walmart's international division. In contrast to the U.S. operations, Asda was originally and still remains primarily a grocery chain, but with a stronger focus on non-food items than most UK supermarket chains other than Tesco. In 2010 Asda acquired stores from Netto UK. In addition to small suburban Asda Supermarkets,[3] larger stores are branded Supercentres.[3] Other banners include Asda Superstores, Asda Living, and Asda Petrol Fueling Station.[2][3][294] In July 2015, Asda updated its logo featuring the Walmart Asterisks behind the first 'A' in the Logo. In May 2018, Walmart announced plans to sell Asda to rival Sainsbury's for $10.1 billion. Under the terms of the deal, Walmart would have received a 42% stake in the combined company and about \u00a33 billion in cash.[295] However, in April 2019, the United Kingdom's Competition and Markets Authority blocked the proposed sale of Asda to Sainsburys.[296]\n\n\nOn October 2, 2020, it was announced that Walmart will sell a majority stake of Asda to a consortium of Zuber and Mohsin Issa (the owners of EG Group) and private equity firm TDR Capital for \u00a36.8bn, pending approval from the Competition and Markets Authority.[297]\n\n\nIn Japan, Walmart owned 100 percent of Seiyu (\u897f\u53cb *Seiy\u016b*) as of 2008.[update][285][298] It operates under the Seiyu (Hypermarket), Seiyu (Supermarket), Seiyu (General Merchandise), Livin, and Sunny banners.[2][3] \nOn November 16, 2020, Walmart announced they would be selling 65% of their shares in the company to the private-equity firm KKR in a deal valuing 329 stores and 34,600 employees at $1.6 billion. Walmart is supposed to retain 15% and a seat on the board, while a joint-venture between KKR and Japanese company Rakuten Inc. will receive 20%.[299]\n\n\n\n#### Corruption charges[edit]\n\n\nAn April 2012 investigation by *The New York Times* reported the allegations of a former executive of Walmart de Mexico that, in September 2005, the company had paid bribes via local fixers to officials throughout Mexico in exchange for construction permits, information, and other favors, which gave Walmart a substantial advantage over competitors.[300] Walmart investigators found credible evidence that Mexican and American laws had been broken. Concerns were also raised that Walmart executives in the United States had \"hushed up\" the allegations. A follow-up investigation by *The New York Times*, published December 17, 2012, revealed evidence that regulatory permission for siting, construction, and operation of nineteen stores had been obtained through bribery. There was evidence that a bribe of US$52,000 was paid to change a zoning map, which enabled the opening of a Walmart store a mile from a historical site in San Juan Teotihuac\u00e1n in 2004.[301] After the initial article was released, Walmart released a statement denying the allegations and describing its anti-corruption policy. While an official Walmart report states that it had found no evidence of corruption, the article alleges that previous internal reports had indeed turned up such evidence before the story became public.[302] *Forbes* magazine contributor Adam Hartung also commented that the bribery scandal was a reflection of Walmart's \"serious management and strategy troubles\", stating, \"[s]candals are now commonplace\u00a0... [e]ach scandal points out that Walmart's strategy is harder to navigate and is running into big problems\".[303]\n\n\nIn 2012, there was an incident with CJ's Seafood, a crawfish processing firm in Louisiana that was partnered with Walmart, that eventually gained media attention for the mistreatment of its 40 H-2B visa workers from Mexico. These workers experienced harsh living conditions in tightly packed trailers outside of the work facility, physical threats, verbal abuse, and were forced to work day-long shifts. Many of the workers were afraid to take action about the abuse due to the fact that the manager threatened the lives of their family members in the U.S. and Mexico if the abuse were to be reported. Eight of the workers confronted management at CJ's Seafood about the mistreatment; however, the management denied the abuse allegations and the workers went on strike. The workers then took their stories to Walmart due to their partnership with CJ's. While Walmart was investigating the situation, the workers collected 150,000 signatures of supporters who agreed that Walmart should stand by the workers and take action. In June 2012, the visa workers held a protest and day-long hunger strike outside of the apartment building where a Walmart board member resided. Following this protest, Walmart announced its final decision to no longer work with CJ's Seafood. Less than a month later, the Department of Labor fined CJ's Seafood \"approximately $460,000 in back-pay, safety violations, wage and hour violations, civil damages, and fines for abuses to the H-2B program. The company has since shut down.\"[304]\n\n\nAs of December\u00a02012,[update] internal investigations were ongoing into possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.[305] Walmart has invested US$99\u00a0million on internal investigations, which expanded beyond Mexico to implicate operations in China, Brazil, and India.[306][307] The case has added fuel to the debate as to whether foreign investment will result in increased prosperity, or if it merely allows local retail trade and economic policy to be taken over by \"foreign financial and corporate interests\".[308][309]\n\n\n\n### Sam's Club[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sam's Club\n\n**Sam's Club** is a chain of warehouse clubs that sell groceries and general merchandise, often in bulk.[35] Locations generally range in size from 32,000\u2013168,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (3,000\u201315,600\u00a0m2), with an average club size of approximately 134,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (12,400\u00a0m2).[4] The first Sam's Club was opened by Walmart, Inc. in 1983 in Midwest City, Oklahoma[310] under the name \"Sam's Wholesale Club\". The chain was named after its founder Sam Walton. As of October 31, 2022, Sam's Club operated 600 membership warehouse clubs and accounted for 11.3% of Walmart's revenue at $57.839 billion in fiscal year 2019.[16][311] Kathryn McLay is the president and CEO of Sam's Club.[151][312]\n\n\n\n### Global eCommerce[edit]\n\n\nBased in San Bruno, California, Walmart's Global eCommerce division provides online retailing for Walmart, Sam's Club, Asda, and all other international brands. There are several locations in the United States in California and Oregon: San Bruno, Sunnyvale, Brisbane, and Portland. Locations outside of the United States include Shanghai (China), Leeds (United Kingdom), and Bangalore (India).\n\n\n\n## Subsidiaries[edit]\n\n\n### Private label brands[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Walmart brands\n\nAbout 40 percent of products sold in Walmart are private labels, which are produced for the company through contracts with manufacturers. Walmart began offering private label brands in 1991, with the launch of Sam's Choice, a line of drinks produced by Cott Beverages for Walmart. Sam's Choice quickly became popular and by 1993, was the third-most-popular beverage brand in the United States.[313] Other Walmart brands include Great Value and Equate in the U.S. and Canada and Smart Price in Britain. A 2006 study talked of \"the magnitude of mind-share Walmart appears to hold in the shoppers' minds when it comes to the awareness of private label brands and retailers.\"[314]\n\n\n\n### Entertainment[edit]\n\n\nIn 2010, the company teamed with Procter & Gamble to produce *Secrets of the Mountain* and *The Jensen Project*, two-hour family movies which featured the characters using Walmart and Procter & Gamble-branded products. *The Jensen Project* also featured a preview of a product to be released in several months in Walmart stores.[315][316] A third movie, *A Walk in My Shoes*, also aired in 2010 and a fourth is in production.[*when?*][317] Walmart's director of brand marketing also serves as co-chair of the Association of National Advertisers's Alliance for Family Entertainment.[318]\n\n\n\n## Online commerce acquisitions and plans[edit]\n\n\nLaunched in 2009, Walmart's Marketplace stayed dormant until 2016 when Walmart purchased e-commerce company Jet.com, founded in 2014 by Marc Lore, to start competing with Amazon.com[319]. Jet.com has acquired its own share of online retailers such as Hayneedle in March 2016, Shoebuy.com in December 2016, and ModCloth in March 2017. Walmart also acquired Parcel, a delivery service in New York, on September 29, 2017.[320][321]\n\n\nOn February 15, 2017, Walmart acquired Moosejaw, an online active outdoor retailer, for approximately $51 million. Moosejaw brought with it partnerships with more than 400 brands, including Patagonia, The North Face, Marmot, and Arc'teryx.[322]\n\n\nMarc Lore, Walmart's U.S. e-commerce CEO, said that Walmart's existing physical infrastructure of almost 5,000 stores around the U.S. will enhance their digital expansion by doubling as warehouses for e-commerce without increasing overhead.[323] As of 2017,[update] Walmart offers in-store pickup for online orders at 1,000 stores with plans to eventually expand the service to all of its stores.[324]\n\n\nOn May 9, 2018, Walmart announced its intent to acquire a 77% controlling stake in the Indian e-commerce website Flipkart for $16 billion[325] (beating bids by Amazon.com), subject to regulatory approval. Following its completion, the website's management will report to Marc Lore.[326][327][328] Completion of the deal was announced on August 18, 2018.[329]\n\n\nThe company's partnership with subscription service Kidbox was announced on April 16, 2019.[330]\n\n\n\n## Corporate affairs[edit]\n\n\n![An American flag waving above a Walmart sign at the entrance of an office park](image)Home office in Bentonville, Arkansas in June 2009\nWalmart is headquartered in the Walmart Home Office complex in Bentonville, Arkansas. The company's business model is based on selling a wide variety of general merchandise at low prices.[11] Doug McMillon became Walmart's CEO on February 1, 2014. He has also worked as the head of Sam's Club and Walmart International.[331] The company refers to its employees as \"associates\". All Walmart stores in the U.S. and Canada also have designated \"greeters\" at the entrance, a practice pioneered by Sam Walton and later imitated by other retailers. Greeters are trained to help shoppers find what they want and answer their questions.[332]\n\n\nFor many years, associates were identified in the store by their signature blue vest, but this practice was discontinued in June 2007 and replaced with khaki pants and polo shirts. The wardrobe change was part of a larger corporate overhaul to increase sales and rejuvenate the company's stock price.[333] In September 2014, the uniform was again updated to bring back a vest (paid for by the company) for store employees over the same polos and khaki or black pants paid for by the employee. The vest is navy blue for Walmart employees at Supercenters and discounts stores, lime green for Walmart Neighborhood Market employees, and yellow for self-check-out associates; door greeters, and customer service managers. All three state \"Proud Walmart Associate\" on the left breast and the \"Spark\" logo covering the back.[334] Reportedly one of the main reasons the vest was reintroduced was that some customers had trouble identifying employees.[335] In 2016, self-checkout associates, door greeters and customer service managers began wearing a yellow vest to be better seen by customers. By requiring employees to wear uniforms that are made up of standard \"streetwear\", Walmart is not required to purchase the uniforms or reimburse employees which are required in some states, as long as that clothing can be worn elsewhere. Businesses are only legally required to pay for branded shirts and pants or clothes that would be difficult to wear outside of work.[336]\n\n\nUnlike many other retailers, Walmart does not charge slotting fees to suppliers for their products to appear in the store.[337] Instead, it focuses on selling more-popular products and provides incentives for store managers to drop unpopular products.[337]\n\n\nFrom 2006 to 2010, the company eliminated its layaway program. In 2011, the company revived its layaway program.[338][339]\n\n\nWalmart introduced its Site-To-Store program in 2007, after testing the program since 2004 on a limited basis. The program allows *walmart.com* customers to buy goods online with a free shipping option, and have goods shipped to the nearest store for pickup.[340]\n\n\nOn September 15, 2017, Walmart announced that it would build a new headquarters in Bentonville to replace its current 1971 building and consolidate operations that have spread out to 20 different buildings throughout Bentonville.[341]\n\n\nAccording to watchdog group Documented, in 2020 Walmart contributed $140,000 to the Rule of Law Defense Fund, a fund-raising arm of the Republican Attorneys General Association.[342]\n\n\n\n### Finance and governance[edit]\n\n\nFor the fiscal year ending January 31, 2019, Walmart reported net income of US$6.67\u00a0billion on $514.405\u00a0billion of revenue. The company's international operations accounted for $120.824\u00a0billion, or 23.7 percent, of its $510.329 billion of sales.[16][7] Walmart is the world's 23rd-largest public corporation, according to the Forbes Global 2000 list, and the largest public corporation when ranked by revenue.[343]\n\n\nWalmart is governed by an eleven-member board of directors elected annually by shareholders. Gregory B. Penner, son-in-law of S. Robson Walton and the grandson-in-law of Sam Walton, serves as chairman of the board. Doug McMillon serves as president and chief executive officer. Current members of the board are:[344][7][345]\n\n\n\n* Gregory B. Penner, chairman of the board of directors of Walmart Inc. and general partner of Madrone Capital Partners\n* Cesar Conde, chairman of NBCUniversal International Group and NBCUniversal Telemundo Enterprises\n* Timothy P. Flynn, retired CEO of KPMG International\n* Sarah Friar, CEO of Nextdoor\n* Carla A. Harris, Vice-chairman of Wealth Management, head of multicultural client strategy, managing director, and senior client advisor at Morgan Stanley\n* Tom Horton, senior advisor at Warburg Pincus, LLC, and retired chairman and CEO of American Airlines\n* Marissa A. Mayer, co-founder of Lumi Labs, Inc., and former president and CEO of Yahoo!, Inc.\n* Doug McMillon, president and CEO of Walmart\n* Randall Stephenson, retired chairman and CEO of AT&T Inc.\n* S. Robson \"Rob\" Walton, retired chairman of the board of directors of Walmart Inc.\n* Steuart Walton, founder of RZC Investments, LLC.\n\n\nNotable former members of the board include Hillary Clinton (1985\u20131992)[346] and Tom Coughlin (2003\u20132004), the latter having served as vice chairman. Clinton left the board before the 1992 U.S. presidential election, and Coughlin left in December 2005 after pleading guilty to wire fraud and tax evasion for stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars from Walmart.[347]\n\n\nAfter Sam Walton's death in 1992, Don Soderquist, Chief Operating Officer and Senior Vice Chairman, became known as the \"Keeper of the Culture\".[348]\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancial and

Exchange Commission, with its registered office located in Wolters Kluwer's Corporation Trust Center in Wilmington. As of March\u00a02017,[update][396] it has 3,292,377,090 outstanding shares. These are held mainly by the Walton family, a number of institutions and funds.[6][397]\n\n\n\n* 43.00% (1,415,891,131): Walton Enterprises LLC\n* 5.30% (174,563,205): Walton family Holdings Trust[398]\n* 3.32% (102,036,399): The Vanguard Group, Inc\n* 2.37% (72,714,226): State Street Corporation\n* 1.37% (42,171,892): BlackRock Institutional Trust Company\n* 0.94% (28,831,721): Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund\n* 0.77% (23,614,578): BlackRock Fund Advisors\n* 0.71% (21,769,126): Dodge & Cox Inc\n* 0.68% (20,978,727): Vanguard 500 Index Fund\n* 0.65% (20,125,838): Bank of America Corporation\n* 0.57% (17,571,058): Bank of New York Mellon Corporation\n* 0.57% (17,556,128): Northern Trust Corporation\n* 0.55% (16,818,165): Vanguard Institutional Index Fund-Institutional Index Fund\n* 0.55% (16,800,850): State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co\n* 0.52% (15,989,827): SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust\n\n\n### Competition[edit]\n\n\nIn North America, Walmart's primary competitors include grocery stores and department stores like Target, Kroger, Aldi, Meijer, Trader Joe's, Ingles, Publix, Harris Teeter and Winn Dixie in the United States; Hudson's Bay, Loblaw retail stores, Sobeys, Metro, and Giant Tiger in Canada; and Comercial Mexicana and Soriana in Mexico. Competitors of Walmart's Sam's Club division are Costco and the smaller BJ's Wholesale Club chain. Walmart's move into the grocery business in the late 1990s set it against major supermarket chains in both the United States and Canada.[399] Studies have typically found that Walmart's prices are significantly lower than those of their competitors, and that Walmart's presence is associated with lower food prices for households. Comparisons of performance metrics such as sales per square foot suggest that supermarkets in direct competition with Walmart Supercenters show significant decreases in profit margins, an effect that is strongest in the case of unionized competitors. Between 2000 and 2010, Walmart's entry into new areas often lowered local food prices at other stores. However, recent studies have not found the same effect, suggesting that retailers may have changed their competitive strategies.[35]\n\n\nWhile the idea that Walmart destroys small businesses is widely assumed to be true, research so far suggests that Walmart superstores have little effect on smaller retailers such as \"Mom and Pop\" businesses. Differences in impact appear to be specific to the goods sold. Small retailers may experience difficulty if they rely on selling products identical to those at Walmart or if they try to sell at lower prices.[35]\nDollar stores such as Family Dollar and Dollar General have been able to find a small niche market and compete successfully against Walmart.[399] In 2004, Walmart responded by testing its own dollar store concept, a subsection of some stores called \"Pennies-n-Cents\".[400][35]\n\n\nWalmart also had to face fierce competition in some foreign markets. For example, in Germany it had captured just 2\u00a0percent of the German food market following its entry into the market in 1997 and remained \"a secondary player\" behind Aldi with 19\u00a0percent.[401]\n\n\nIn May 2006, after entering the South Korean market in 1998, Walmart sold all 16\u00a0of its South Korean outlets to Shinsegae, a local retailer, for US$882\u00a0million. Shinsegae re-branded the Walmarts as E-mart stores.[402]\n\n\nWalmart struggled to export its brand elsewhere as it rigidly tried to reproduce its model overseas. In China, Walmart hopes to succeed by adapting and doing things preferable to Chinese citizens. For example, it found that Chinese consumers preferred to select their own live fish and seafood; stores began displaying the meat uncovered and installed fish tanks, leading to higher sales.[403]\n\n\n\n### Customer base[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of Walmart locations in the United States, as of December\u00a02020[update]\nIn the United States, Walmart's early growth occurred in the Southeast and lower Midwest. More recently, Walmart has expanded throughout the country. The number of Walmart stores per 1,000 people in 2019 was highest in Arkansas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Alabama and Kansas, and lowest in Hawaii, California, New Jersey, Massachusetts and New York. California and New Jersey were two of the ten states with the largest increases in Supercenters between 2011 and 2020, along with Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Wisconsin.[35]\n\n\nWalmart customers display strong customer loyalty[404] and cite low prices as the most important reason for shopping there. Walmart has characterized their shoppers as falling into three main groups: \"value-price shoppers\" (people who like low prices and cannot afford much more), \"brand aspirationals\" (people with low incomes who buy well-known brands in hopes of assuring quality), and \"price-sensitive affluents\" (wealthier shoppers who seek deals).[405] As of 2022[update] the average U.S. Walmart customer earned about $80,000 per year,[404] above the U.S. average personal income of $63,214.[406] Walmart reports that during times of rising inflation, customers become more sensitive to rising food prices, buying less expensive food items such as hot dogs and canned tuna rather than deli cold cuts. They also see more upper-income shoppers looking for bargains.[407]\n\n\nWalmart shoppers have been reported to be politically conservative. A poll after the 2004 US presidential election reported that 76\u00a0percent of voters who shopped at Walmart once a week reported voting for George W. Bush while only 23 percent supported senator John Kerry.[408] When measured against similar retailers in the U.S. in 2006, frequent Walmart shoppers were rated the most politically conservative.[409] As of 2014[update] 54\u00a0percent of Americans who preferred to shop at Walmart reported that they opposed same-sex marriage, while 40 percent were in favor, reflecting the store's southern roots.[410]\n\n\nDue to its concentration of stores in the Bible Belt, Walmart is known for its \"tradition of tailoring its service to churchgoing customers\".[411] Walmart has carried clean versions of hip-hop audio CDs and in cooperation with The Timothy Plan, placed \"plastic sheathes over suggestive women's periodicals and banned 'lad mags' such as Maxim\" magazine.[411] Walmart also caters to its Christian customer base by selling Christian books and media,[412] such as VeggieTales videos and The Purpose-Driven Life, earning the company over US$1\u00a0billion annually.[413][414]\n\n\nIn 2006, Walmart took steps to expand its U.S. customer base, announcing a modification in its U.S. stores from a \"one-size-fits-all\" merchandising strategy to one designed to \"reflect each of six demographic groups\u2014African-Americans, the affluent, empty-nesters, Hispanics, suburbanites, and rural residents.\"[415] Around six months later, it unveiled a new slogan: *\"Saving people money so they can live better lives\"*.[405]\n\n\nWalmart has also made steps to appeal to more liberal customers, for example, by rejecting the American Family Association's recommendations and carrying the DVD *Brokeback Mountain*, a love story between two gay cowboys in Wyoming.[416]\n\n\n\n### Sales of guns and ammunition[edit]\n\n\nWalmart stopped selling handguns in all U.S. states, except for Alaska, in 1993.[417]\n\n\nIn 2018, Walmart stopped selling guns and ammunition to persons younger than 21, following a similar move by Dick's Sporting Goods on the same day.[418] In the same year, Walmart stopped selling military-style rifles that were commonly used in mass shootings.[417]\n\n\nAs of 2019, Walmart was a major retailer of firearms and ammunition.[419] In 2019, after 23 people[420] were killed in a mass shooting at a Walmart store in El Paso, Texas, Walmart announced that it would stop selling all handgun ammunition and certain short-barreled rifle ammunition.[419] The company also announced that it would stop selling handguns in Alaska, the only state where the company still sold handguns.[418] The move was expected to reduce Walmart's U.S. market share in ammunition from around 20% to around 6\u20139%.[418] Walmart also stated that it was \"respectfully requesting\" that customers not openly carry weapons in Walmart stores, except for authorized law enforcement officers.[419][418]\n\n\nFollowing the fatal police shooting of Walter Wallace Jr. in October 2020, Walmart temporarily removed gun and ammunition displays in thousands of stores across the U.S. from sales floors, grounding their reason in concerns of civil unrest. Company spokesman Kory Lundberg said in a statement that \"We have seen some isolated civil unrest and as we have done on several occasions over the last few years, we have moved our firearms and ammunition off the sales floor as a precaution for the safety of our associates and customers.\" Firearms and ammunition will still be available for purchase on request, but the duration of the removal of both from the sales floor remains undetermined.[421]\n\n\n\n### Technology[edit]\n\n\n#### Open source software[edit]\n\n\nMany Walmart technology projects are coded in the open and available through the Walmart Labs GitHub repository[422] as open-source software under the OSI approved Apache V2.0 license. As of November\u00a02016,[update] 141 public GitHub projects are listed.\n\n\nDuring a migration of the walmart.com retail platform to Facebook React and Node.js, the Electrode[423] project was created to power the e-commerce platform which serves 80 million visitors per month and 15 million items.\n\n\nThe electrode provides various developer enhancements and tools for the developer including Node.js configuration and feature management.\n\n\nAlex Grigoryan[424] of Walmart Labs released a statement[425] on Medium.com on October 3, 2016, explaining the details of the applications and the scale that they operate at Walmart.\n\n\n\n#### Big data analytics[edit]\n\n\nAs the largest retailer in the U.S., Walmart collects and analyzes a large amount of consumer data. The big data sets are mined for use in predictive analytics, which allow the company to optimize operations by predicting customer's habits. Walmart's datacenter is unofficially referred to as Area 71.[426]\n\n\nIn April 2011, Walmart acquired Kosmix to develop software for analyzing real-time data streams.[427] In August 2012, Walmart announced its Polaris search engine.[428]\n\n\nThe amount of data gathered by Walmart has raised privacy concerns.[429][430][431]\n\n\n\n#### Cash handling[edit]\n\n\nin 2016, Walmart began a drive to automate much of the cash handling process. Walmart began replacing employees who count currency by hand with machines that count 8 bills per second and 3,000 coins a minute. The processing machines, located in the back of stores, allow cashiers to process the money for electronic depositing.[432][433]\n\n\n\n## Charity[edit]\n\n\nSam Walton believed that the company's contribution to society was that it operated efficiently, thereby lowering the cost of living for customers, and, therefore, in that sense was a \"powerful force for good\", despite his refusal to contribute cash to philanthropic causes.[434] Having begun to feel that his wealth attracted people who wanted nothing more than a \"handout\", he explained that while he believed his family had been fortunate and wished to use his wealth to aid worthy causes like education, they could not be expected to \"solve every personal problem that comes to [their] attention\". He explained later in his autobiography, \"We feel very strongly that Wal-Mart really is *not*, and *should not* be, in the charity business,\" stating \"any debit has to be passed along to somebody\u2014either shareholders or our customers.\"[435] Since Sam Walton's death in 1992, however, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation dramatically increased charitable giving. For example, in 2005, Walmart donated US$20\u00a0million in cash and merchandise for Hurricane Katrina relief and in 2020 they committed $25 million to organizations on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic response.[436] Today, Walmart's charitable donations approach US$1\u00a0billion each year.[437]\n\n\n\n### COVID-19[edit]\n\n\nAs of January 2021, healthcare workers could get vaccines through Walmart in New Mexico and Arkansas. Walmart planned to offer vaccines in Georgia, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, New Jersey, South Carolina, Texas, Chicago and Puerto Rico with the target of delivering between 10 million and 13 million doses per month at full capacity.[438][439][440]\n\n\nIn May 2021, Walmart said that starting from May 18 all its fully vaccinated employees can stop wearing masks at work following the guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.[441]\n\n\n\n## Economic impact[edit]\n\n\n### Effects on customers[edit]\n\n\nA 2005 story in *The Washington Post* reported that \"Wal-Mart's discounting on food alone boosts the welfare of American shoppers by at least US$50\u00a0billion per year.\"[442] A study in 2005 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) measured the effect on consumer welfare and found that the poorest segment of the population benefits the most from the existence of discount retailers.[443] \nIn 2006, American newspaper columnist George Will stated that In terms of economic effects, \"Wal-Mart and its effects save shoppers more than US$200\u00a0billion a year, dwarfing such government programs as food stamps (US$28.6\u00a0billion) and the earned income tax credit (US$34.6\u00a0billion)\".[444]\n\n\n\n### Effects on retailers[edit]\n\n\nKenneth Stone, Professor of Economics at Iowa State University, in a paper published in *Farm Foundation* (1997), found that some small towns can lose almost half of their retail trade within ten years of a Walmart store opening. Presumably, people who previously shopped in towns without Wal-Mart stores choose to shop in towns with Wal-Mart stores, part of an older pattern in which smaller centers lose retail sales to larger ones. Stone compared the changes to previous competitors that small town shops have faced in the past, such as the development of the railroads, the Sears Roebuck catalog, and shopping malls. He concluded that small towns are more affected by \"discount mass merchandiser stores\" than larger towns and that shop owners who adapt to the ever-changing retail market can \"co-exist and even thrive in this type of environment.\"[63] In later research Artz and Stone (2006) reported that in Mississippi the impact of opening a Walmart was much larger on existing retailers in rural communities (17%) than more urban ones (4%).[35][445] This also suggests that Walmart has achieved its strongest growth in non-metropolitan areas, which tend to be low-income.[35]\n\n\nStudies of the impact of Walmart tend to focus on Supercenters rather than Neighborhood Markets. Comparisons of performance metrics such as sales per square foot suggest that supermarkets and other high-volume retailers in direct competition with Walmart Supercenters show significant decreases in profit margins.[35] While Walmart has often been said to be a destroyer of small businesses, much of this is anecdotal. Research so far suggests that Walmart superstores have little effect on smaller retailers such as \"Mom and Pop\" businesses.[35] A 2008 economic analysis published in the journal *Economic Inquiry* suggested that \"the process of creative destruction unleashed by Wal\u2010Mart has had no statistically significant long\u2010run impact on the overall size and profitability of the small business sector in the United States.\"[446]\n\n\nImpact appears to be related to a number of factors, with a key factor being the goods offered for sale.[35] A study by Ailawadi and others (2010) examined the impact of new Walmarts in detail. She reported that median sales dropped 40 percent at similar high-volume stores, 17 percent at supermarkets and 6 percent at drugstores. However, 30 percent of specific product categories at high-volume stores were unaffected. Many retailers reduced prices and cut product selection in an attempt to compete directly with Walmart, in effect attacking its areas of strength. A more successful approach was to track sales, identify vulnerable categories, and increase the range of products in those categories. By including products at both top and bottom price points, and offering temporary promotions on those items, retailers could attract both customers who were price-conscious and those interested in a wider range of options. A small store that specialized in a particular product area could compete effectively against Walmart.[447][448] Small specialized stores are less effective against big-box category killer chains such as Home Depot and Best Buy electronics.[449]\n\n\nSome studies have suggested that the impact a Walmart store has on a local business is correlated to its distance from the store. David Merriman, Joseph Persky, Julie Davis and Ron Baiman (2012) outlined the impacts of Walmart in Chicago. Based on three annual surveys of enterprises within a four-mile radius of a new Chicago Walmart it \"shows that the probability of going out of business was significantly higher for establishments close to that store\". The overall findings of this study reinforce the \"contention that large-city Walmarts, like those in small towns, absorb retail sales from nearby stores without significantly expanding the market\".[450] Ellickson & Grieco (2013) report in the *Journal of Urban Economics* that Wal-Marts most strongly affect outlets of larger chains that are within 2 miles (3.2\u00a0km) of their location.[451]\n\n\n\n### Effects on jobs[edit]\n\n\nA 2022 literature review concludes that \"there is no consensus on the impact of Walmart on local employment, but most studies on the topic point to a modest increase in retail employment\".[35] For example, studies at the University of Missouri found that a new store increases net retail employment in the county by 100 jobs in the short term, half of which disappear over five years as other retail establishments close.[452][453] Similarly, a net increase in employment (55 jobs) was found in a study of West Virginia counties between 1989 and 1998.[454]\n\n\nLike other chain stores, Walmart tends to hire local employees for low-skilled jobs with low wages and minimal benefits.[35] This may increase employees' reliance on public assistance programs, effectively transferring costs away from employers onto taxpayers.[449] Studies examining aggregate retail wage data from states and counties, before and after the arrival of Walmart, are mixed. Some results, particularly from nonmetropolitan areas in the South and central United States, suggest lowered wages. Other studies have found no effect (e.g. Pennsylvania) or an increase in wages (e.g. Maryland).[449] A 2004 paper by Goetz and Swaminathan suggested that U.S. counties with Walmart stores suffered increased poverty compared with counties without Wal-Marts.[455] It is difficult to distinguish the effects of opening a Walmart from other factors that occur in the same time and place, some of which may be related to the decision to open a store. Known as endogeneity bias, this makes it difficult to determine whether Walmart chooses to establish itself in communities with greater poverty and joblessness, or creates more poverty and joblessness.[449]\n\n\nStudies of socioeconomic well-being, civic participation, and community welfare suggest that large non-locally owned businesses tend to be centralized and vertically integrated, rely on remote sources and support services, and move money, expertise and power away from local communities. Large externally-oriented businesses tend to be associated with lower local standards of living, greater inequality, and less social and civic participation. In contrast, locally oriented businesses are associated with higher rates of church membership, community engagement, civic improvement and recreation. They may also be associated with higher rates of home-ownership and expenditures on health and public schools. The presence of local entrepreneurs with resources and motivation to invest in local communities may be key to addressing community problems. This research is not specific to Walmart, but to large businesses in general.[449]\n\n\nIn broader economic terms, the Economic Policy Institute estimated that between 2001 and 2006 Wal-Mart's trade deficit with China alone represented a loss of nearly 200,000 U.S. jobs. During this period, Wal-Mart was responsible for 9.3% of total U.S. imports from China, increasing the U.S. trade deficit by an estimated $17.1 billion. This represents about 200,000 jobs, most of them in the manufacturing sector (133,000).[456]\n\n\nA 2014 story in *The Guardian* reported that the Wal-Mart Foundation was boosting its efforts to work with U.S. manufacturers. In February 2014, the Walmart Foundation pledged to support domestic manufacturers by buying US$250\u00a0billion worth of American-made products in the next decade.[457] Between 2014 and 2017, the Walmart U.S. Manufacturing Innovation Fund gave $10 million in grants to research and academic institutions for projects that improve domestic manufacturing.[458] For the 2020 fiscal year, Walmart reported that nearly two-thirds of its merchandise was made, assembled or grown in the United States. As of March 2021, Walmart pledged to buy an additional $350 billion worth of American-based items over the next decade.[459]\n\n\n\n### Effects on productivity[edit]\n\n\nA 2001 McKinsey Global Institute study of U.S. labor productivity growth between 1995 and 2000 concluded that \"Wal-Mart directly and indirectly caused the bulk of the productivity acceleration\" in general merchandise, representing 16 percent of total productivity growth in the retail sector.[460]\nWalmart's transformative use of information technology, particularly in supply-chain management, is identified as a major reason for its impact on productivity per man hour.[461][462][463] For every dollar spent by Walmart to improve its own technology, an estimated ten dollars has been invested by suppliers throughout its supply chain on their own systems and software. Economist Robert Solow has emphasized the importance of imitation and adaptation, as well as innovation. In addition to improving its own efficiency, Walmart's innovations have been adopted by its competitors so that they can compete.[461]\n\n\n\n## Labor relations[edit]\n\n\nWorkers speak during Occupy Wall Street\nWith over 2.3 million employees worldwide, Walmart has faced a torrent of lawsuits and issues with regards to its workforce. These issues involve low wages, poor working conditions, inadequate health care, and issues involving the company's strong anti-union policies. In November 2013, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) announced that it had found that in 13\u00a0U.S. states, Wal-Mart had pressured employees not to engage in strikes on Black Friday, and had illegally disciplined workers who had engaged in strikes.[464] Critics point to Walmart's high turnover rate as evidence of an unhappy workforce, although other factors may be involved. Approximately 70\u00a0percent of its employees leave within the first year.[465] Despite this turnover rate, the company is still able to affect unemployment rates. This was found in a study by Oklahoma State University which states, \"Walmart is found to have substantially lowered the relative unemployment rates of blacks in those counties where it is present, but to have had only a limited impact on relative incomes after the influences of other socio-economic variables were taken into account.\"[466]\n\n\nWalmart is the largest private employer in the United States, with 1.6 million employees as of 2020.[35] Walmart employs almost five times as many people as IBM, the second-largest employer.[467] Walmart employs more African Americans than any other private employer in the United States.[468]\nWhile 4.6% of all retail workers, and 16.5% of all US grocery workers, were unionized as of 2020, Walmart does not employ unionized labor and actively discourages unionization and collective bargaining.[35][469][470]\n\n\nWalmart rebranded their Associate Education Benefits to Live Better U in March 2019. Live Better U supports associate education at every level and includes $1 a day college program, cost-free high school education, and discounts on higher education programs through partnership with Guild Education.\n\n\nIn April 2019, Walmart Inc. announced plans to extend the use of robots in stores in order to improve and monitor inventory, clean floors and unload trucks, part of the company's effort to lower its labor costs.[471]\n\n\nIn June 2019, Walmart Inc. announced the expansion of education benefits to recruit high school students. The incentives include flexible work schedules, free SAT and ACT preparation courses, up to seven hours of free college credit, and a debt-free college degree in three fields from six nonprofit universities.[472]\n\n\n\n### Gender[edit]\n\n\nIn 2007, a gender discrimination lawsuit, *Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.*, was filed against Walmart, alleging that female employees were discriminated against in matters regarding pay and promotions. A class action suit was sought, which would have been the nation's largest in history, covering 1.5\u00a0million past and current employees.[473] On June 20, 2011, the United States Supreme Court ruled in Wal-Mart's favor, stating that the plaintiffs did not have enough in common to constitute a class.[474] The court ruled unanimously that because of the variability of the plaintiffs' circumstances, the class action could not proceed as presented, and furthermore, in a 5\u20134 decision that it could not proceed as any kind of class action suit.[475] Several plaintiffs, including the lead plaintiff, Betty Dukes, expressed their intent to file individual discrimination lawsuits separately.[476] Dukes died in 2017.[477] In 2020, Walmart agreed to pay $20 million, stop using a pre-employment test, and furnish other relief to settle a companywide, sex-based hiring discrimination lawsuit filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).[478]\n\n\nAccording to a consultant hired by plaintiffs in a sex discrimination lawsuit, in 2001, Wal-Mart's Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filings showed that female employees made up 65 percent of Wal-Mart's hourly paid workforce, but only 33\u00a0percent of its management.[479][480] Just 35\u00a0percent of its store managers were women, compared to 57 percent at similar retailers.[480] Wal-Mart says comparisons with other retailers are unfair, because it classifies employees differently; if department managers were included in the totals, women would make up 60\u00a0percent of the managerial ranks.[480]\n\n\n\n### Sexual orientation and gender identity[edit]\n\n\nIn the Human Rights Campaign's (HRC) 2002 Corporate Equality Index, a measure of how companies treat LGBT employees and customers, gave Wal-Mart Stores Inc. a score of 14%.[481] By 2017, however, HRC's 2017 Corporate Equality Index gave Wal-Mart Stores Inc. a score of a 100%.[482] In 2003, Walmart added sexual orientation to their anti-discrimination policy.[483] In 2005, Walmart's definition of family began including same-sex partners.[484][485][486] In 2006, Walmart announced that \"diversity efforts include new groups of minority, female and gay employees that meet at Walmart headquarters in Bentonville to advise the company on marketing and internal promotion. There are seven business resource groups: women, African Americans, Hispanics, Asians, Native Americans, gays and lesbians, and a disabled group.\"[487] From 2006 to 2008, Walmart was a member of the National Gay & Lesbian Chamber of Commerce.[488] In 2011, Walmart added gender identity to their anti-discrimination policy.[489] Walmart's anti-discrimination policies allow associates to use restroom facilities that corresponds with their gender identity and gender expression.[490] In 2013, Walmart began offering health insurance benefits to domestic partners.[488] In 2015, Doug McMillon, CEO of Walmart, issued a statement opposing House Bill 1228 and asked Governor Asa Hutchinson to veto the bill.[491] In 2016, Walmart began offering full healthcare benefits to its transgender employees.[492]\n\n\n\n## Criticism and controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Criticism of Walmart\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section may **lend undue weight to certain ideas, incidents, or controversies**.

They have protested against the company's policies and business practices, including charges of racial and gender discrimination.[493][494][495] Other areas of criticism include the company's foreign product sourcing, treatment of suppliers, employee compensation and working conditions, environmental practices, the use of public subsidies, the company's security policies, and slavery.[496][497] Walmart denies doing anything wrong and maintains that low prices are the result of efficiency.[498][499][500]\n\n\nIn April 2016, Walmart announced that it plans to eliminate eggs from battery cages from its supply chain by 2025.[501] The decision was particularly important because of Walmart's large market share and influence on the rest of the industry.[502][503] The move was praised by major animal welfare groups[504] but a poultry trade group representative expressed skepticism about the decision's impact.[504] Walmart's cage-free eggs will not come from free range producers, but rather industrial-scale farms where the birds will be allotted between 1 and 1.5 square feet each, a stressful arrangement which can cause cannibalism.[502][504] Unlike battery cages, the systems of Walmart's suppliers allow the hens to move around, but relative to battery cages they have higher hen mortality rates and present distinct environmental and worker health problems.[505]\n\n\nIn March 2018, Walmart was sued by former Director of Business Development Tri Huynh for claims of reporting misleading e-commerce performance results in favor of the company. Huynh stated the company's move was an attempt to regain lost ground to competitor Amazon.[506]\n\n\nIn September 2018, Walmart was sued by Equal Employment Opportunity Commission alleging that Walmart denied requests from pregnant employees to limit heavy lifting.[507]\n\n\nIn May 2019, the Center for Inquiry filed a lawsuit in the District of Columbia alleging consumer fraud and the endangering of its customers' health due to Walmart's practice of \"selling homeopathic [products] alongside real medicine, in the same sections in its stores, under the same signs\", according to Nicholas Little, CFI's vice president and general counsel.[508][509] On May 20, 2020, District of Columbia Superior Court Judge Florence Pan dismissed CFI's lawsuit, claiming that CFI had no standing as a consumer protection organization and failed to identify the specific actions on the part of Walmart that led to harm to consumers. CFI has challenged both of those arguments and is planning an appeal.[510]\n\n\nIn July 2019, the Walmart subreddit was flooded with pro-union memes in a protest to the firing of an employee who posted confidential material to the subreddit.[511][512] Many of these posts were angry with Walmart surveying its staff on the Internet. The posting of the union content is in response to the aforementioned alleged anti-union position Walmart has taken in the past.[513]\n\n\nIn November 2021, a federal jury found that Walmart, along with Walgreens and CVS, \"had substantially contributed to\" the opioid crisis.[514] The damages between the three chains in this suit totalled $650 million. Damages claimed by the lawyers for Lake County and Trumbull County in Ohio were $3.3 billion. Two other chains, Rite Aid and Giant Eagle, settled with these counties for undisclosed sums before going to trial.[515]\n\n\nIn June 2022, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) sued Walmart, alleging that the company facilitated money transfer fraud. The FTC claimed that Walmart allowed its money transfer services to be used by scammers who stole hundreds of millions of dollars from customers.[516][517]\n\n\n\n### Crime problems[edit]\n\n\nAccording to an August 2016 report by *Bloomberg Businessweek*, aggressive cost-cutting decisions that began in 2000 when Lee Scott took over as CEO of the company led to a significant increase in crime in stores across the United States. These included the removal of the store's famed greeters, who are in part seen as a theft deterrent at exits, the replacement of many cashiers with self-checkout stations, and the addition of stores at a rate that exceeded the hiring of new employees, which led to a 19% increase in space per employee from a decade previous. While these decisions succeeded in increasing profits 23% in the decade that followed, they also led to an increase in both theft and violent crime.[518][449]\n\n\nIn 2015, under CEO Doug McMillon, Walmart began a company-wide campaign to reduce crime that included spot-checking receipts at exits, stationing employees at self-checkout areas, eye-level security cameras in high-theft areas, use of data analytics to detect credit fraud, hiring off-duty police and private security officers, and reducing calls to police with a program by which first-time offenders caught stealing merchandise below a certain value can avoid arrest if they agree to go through a theft-prevention program.[518]\n\n\nLaw enforcement agencies across the United States have noted a burden on resources created by a disproportionate number of calls from Walmart. Experts have criticized the retailer for shifting its security burden onto the taxpayers.[449] Across three Florida counties, approximately 9,000 police calls were logged to 53 Walmart stores but resulted in only a few hundred arrests.[519] In Granite Falls, North Carolina, 92% of larceny calls to local police were from the Walmart store there.[520] The trend is similar in rural, suburban, and urban areas. Police are called to Walmart stores 3 to 4 times as much as similar retailers such as Target.[521] Experts say the chain and its razor-thin profit margins rely heavily on police to protect its bottom line. Walmart Supercenters top the list of those most visited by police.[519]\n\n\nThe police captain in Port Richey, Florida, said that Target stores more often have uniformed security, as well as more visible staff in any case. Another comparison might be shopping malls which often have security patrols and off-duty police officers. J.R. Roberts, a former director for risk management at Valor Security Services (which provides mall security) says: \"Shopping centers all have security; they know it's an expense, but one they know pays dividends because people feel safer going to their stores.\"[518]\n\n\nIn addition to hundreds of thousands of petty crimes, more than 200 violent crimes, including attempted kidnappings, stabbings, shootings, and murders occurred at the 4,500 Walmarts in the U.S. in 2016.[518] In 2019, 23 people were killed in a mass shooting at a Walmart store in El Paso, Texas.[418][420]\n\n\nOn June 27, 2020, a shooting occurred at a Walmart distribution center in Red Bluff, California, United States. One employee was killed, four other employees were wounded, and the shooter was killed by officers.[522][523][524][525]\n\n\nIn April 2022, Walmart decided to take service dog paraphernalia out of stores and online, following an online petition to have them stop selling service dog vests.[526]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n* \"Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes\" \u2013 a 2004 episode of Comedy Central's *South Park*\n* A Walmart Supercenter appeared in the 2021 film *Ghostbusters: Afterlife*, at a fictional Oklahoma town, Summerville. It was filmed in a Walmart store (Store #3013) on location in Deerfoot City shopping center at Calgary, Alberta.[527]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n* ![icon](image)Business and economics portal\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n\n\n* Big-box store\n* Lukas Walton\n* Walmart greeter\n* Wal-Mart First Tee Open at Pebble Beach \u2013 former name of a golf tournament\n* *Wal-Mart: The High Cost of Low Price* \u2013 a 2005 documentary film by director Robert Greenwald\n* Walmarting \u2013 a neologism\n* *Why Wal-Mart Works; and Why That Drives Some People C-R-A-Z-Y* \u2013 a 2005 rebuttal to the Greenwald documentary\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The logo's spark symbol has been in use since September 2007.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Our History\". *Corporate.Walmart.com*.

Rockefeller's Standard Oil. The company, which took its present name in 1999 per the merger of Exxon and Mobil, is vertically integrated across the entire oil and gas industry, and within it is also a chemicals division which produces plastic, synthetic rubber, and other chemical products. ExxonMobil is headquartered near the Houston suburb of Spring, Texas, though officially incorporated in the U.S. state of New Jersey.[7][8]:\u200a1\n\n\nExxonMobil's history traces its earliest roots to 1866 with the formation of the Vacuum Oil Company, itself acquired by Standard Oil in 1879. The company that is today known as ExxonMobil grew out of the **Standard Oil Company of New Jersey** (or **Jersey Standard** for short), the corporate entity which effectively controlled all of Standard Oil prior to its breakup. Jersey Standard grew alongside and with extensive partnership another Standard Oil descendant and its future merger partner, the Standard Oil Company of New York (Socony), both of which grew bigger by merging with various third companies like Humble Oil (which merged with Jersey Standard) and Vacuum Oil (merged with Socony). Both companies underwent rebranding in the 1960s and early 1970s, and by the time of the 1999 merger, Jersey Standard had been known as Exxon, and Socony known as Mobil. The merger agreement between Exxon and Mobil stipulated that Exxon would buy Mobil and rebrand as ExxonMobil, with Mobil's CEO becoming the vice-chairman of the company.[9]\n\n\nExxonMobil is one of the world's largest and most powerful companies. ExxonMobil since its merger varied from the first to tenth largest publicly traded company by revenue, and has one of the largest market capitalizations out of any company.[10][11] As of 2023, in the most recent rankings released in the *Fortune* 500, ExxonMobil was ranked third, and twelfth on the *Fortune* Global 500.[12] ExxonMobil is the largest investor-owned oil company in the world, the largest oil company headquartered in the Western world, and the largest of the Big Oil companies in both production and market value.[13][14] ExxonMobil's reserves were 20\u00a0billion\u00a0BOE at the end of 2016 and the 2007 rates of production were expected to last more than 14 years.[15] With 21 oil refineries constituting a combined daily refining capacity of 4.9 million barrels (780,000\u00a0m3), ExxonMobil is the second largest oil refiner in the world, trailing only Sinopec.[16][17] Approximately 55.56% of the company's shares are held by institutions, the largest of which as of 2019 were The Vanguard Group (8.15%), BlackRock (6.61%), and State Street Corporation (4.83%).\n\n\nExxonMobil has been widely criticized, mostly for environmental incidents and its history of climate change denial against the scientific consensus that fossil fuels significantly contribute to global warming. The company is responsible for many oil spills, the largest and most notable of which was the *Exxon Valdez* oil spill in Alaska and itself considered to be one of the world's worst oil spills in terms of damage to the environment.[18][19] The company has also been the target of accusations of human rights violations, excessive influence on America's foreign policy, and its impact on various societies across the world.[20]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of ExxonMobil\n\nExxonMobil traces its roots to Vacuum Oil Company, founded in 1866. Vacuum Oil later was acquired by Standard Oil in 1879, divested from Standard in 1911 with its breakup, and merged by the Standard Oil Company of New York (Socony), later known as Mobil, in 1931. After the 1911 breakup, Standard Oil continued to exist through its New Jersey subsidiary, sometimes shortened to Jersey Standard, and retained the Standard Oil name in much of the eastern United States. Jersey Standard grew by acquiring Humble Oil in the 1930s and became the dominant oil company on the world stage. The company's lack of ownership over the Standard Oil name across the United States, however, prompted a name change to unify all of its brands under one name, choosing to name itself Exxon in 1972 over continuing to use three distinct brands of Esso, Enco, and Humble.[21][9]\n\n\nIn 1998, the two companies agreed to merge and form ExxonMobil, with the deal closing on November 30, 1999. The two companies cited lower oil prices and a better ability to compete with other state-owned oil companies outside of the United States like Pemex and Aramco. With the deal, the two companies practically merged, with the new company's name containing both of the trade names of its immediate predecessors. However, the structure of the merger provided that Exxon was the surviving company and bought Mobil, rather than a new company being created.[9][22][23][24]\n\n\n\n## Operations[edit]\n\n\nExxonMobil is the largest non-government-owned company in the energy industry and produces about 3% of the world's oil and about 2% of the world's energy.[25]\n\n\nExxonMobil is vertically integrated into a number of global operating divisions. These divisions are grouped into three categories for reference purposes, though the company also has several standalone divisions, such as Coal & Minerals. It also owns hundreds of smaller subsidiaries such as XTO Energy and SeaRiver Maritime. ExxonMobil also has a majority ownership stake in Imperial Oil.[26]\n\n\n\n* Upstream (oil exploration, extraction, shipping, and wholesale operations)\n* Product Solutions (downstream, chemical)\n* Low Carbon Solutions [27]\n\n\n### Upstream[edit]\n\n\nThe upstream division makes up the majority of ExxonMobil's revenue, accounting for approximately 70% of it.[28] In 2021, ExxonMobil had about 30 billion barrels of oil and oil equivalents, as well as 38.1 billion cubic feet of natural gas.[29]\n\n\nIn the United States, ExxonMobil's petroleum exploration and production activities are concentrated in the Permian Basin, Bakken Formation, Woodford Shale, Caney Shale, and the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, ExxonMobil has several gas developments in the regions of Marcellus Shale, Utica Shale, Haynesville Shale, Barnett Shale, and Fayetteville Shale. All natural gas activities are conducted by its subsidiary, XTO Energy. As of December 31, 2014, ExxonMobil owned 14.6\u00a0million acres (59,000\u00a0km2) in the United States, of which 1.7\u00a0million acres (6,900\u00a0km2) were offshore, 1.5\u00a0million acres (6,100\u00a0km2) of which were in the Gulf of Mexico.[30] In California, it has a joint venture called Aera Energy LLC with Shell Oil. In Canada, the company holds 5.4\u00a0million acres (22,000\u00a0km2), including 1\u00a0million acres (4,000\u00a0km2) offshore and 0.7\u00a0million acres (2,800\u00a0km2) of the Kearl Oil Sands Project.[30]\n\n\nIn Argentina, ExxonMobil holds 0.9\u00a0million acres (3,600\u00a0km2) and 4.9\u00a0million acres (20,000\u00a0km2) in Germany. In the Netherlands ExxonMobil owns 1.5\u00a0million acres (6,100\u00a0km2), in Norway it owns 0.4\u00a0million acres (1,600\u00a0km2) offshore, and the United Kingdom 0.6\u00a0million acres (2,400\u00a0km2) offshore. In Africa, upstream operations are concentrated in Angola, where it owns 0.4\u00a0million acres (1,600\u00a0km2) offshore, Chad where it owns 46,000 acres (19,000\u00a0ha), Equatorial Guinea, where it owns 0.1\u00a0million acres (400\u00a0km2) offshore, and Nigeria, where it owns 0.8\u00a0million acres (3,200\u00a0km2) offshore.[30] In addition, ExxonMobil plans to start exploration activities off the coast of Liberia and the Ivory Coast.[31][32] In the past, ExxonMobil had exploration activities in Madagascar, however these operations were ended due to unsatisfactory results.[33]\n\n\nIn Asia, it holds 9,000 acres (3,600\u00a0ha) in Azerbaijan, 1.7\u00a0million acres (6,900\u00a0km2) in Indonesia, of which 1.3\u00a0million acres (5,300\u00a0km2) are offshore, 0.7\u00a0million acres (2,800\u00a0km2) in Iraq, 0.3\u00a0million acres (1,200\u00a0km2) in Kazakhstan, 0.2\u00a0million acres (810\u00a0km2) in Malaysia, 65,000 acres (26,000\u00a0ha) in Qatar, 10,000 acres (4,000\u00a0ha) in Yemen, 21,000 acres (8,500\u00a0ha) in Thailand, and 81,000 acres (33,000\u00a0ha) in the United Arab Emirates.[30]\n\n\nUntil the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, ExxonMobil held 85,000 acres (34,000\u00a0ha) in the Sakhalin-I project through its subsidiary Exxon Neftegas. Together with Rosneft, it has developed 63.6\u00a0million acres (257,000\u00a0km2) in Russia, including the East-Prinovozemelsky field. In Australia, ExxonMobil held 1.7\u00a0million acres (6,900\u00a0km2), including 1.6\u00a0million acres (6,500\u00a0km2) offshore. It also operates the Longford Gas Conditioning Plant, and participates in the development of Gorgon LNG project. In Papua New Guinea, it holds 1.1\u00a0million acres (4,500\u00a0km2), including the PNG Gas project.[30] After Russia's 2022 invasion began, though, ExxonMobil announced it was fully pulling out of both Russia and Sakhalin-I, and launched a lawsuit against Russia's federal government on August 30.[34]\n\n\n\n### Product Solutions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An ExxonMobil gas station in Hiawassee, Georgia\nExxonMobil formed its Product Solutions division in 2022, combining its previously separate Downstream and Chemical divisions into a single company.[35]\n\n\n\n#### Downstream and Retail[edit]\n\n\nExxonMobil markets products around the world under the brands of Exxon, Mobil, and Esso. Mobil is ExxonMobil's primary retail gasoline brand in California, Florida, New York, New England, the Great Lakes, and the Midwest. Exxon is the primary brand in the rest of the United States, with the highest concentration of retail outlets located in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Texas (shared with Mobil), and in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern states. ExxonMobil has stations in 46 states, just behind Shell USA and ahead of Phillips 66, lacking a presence only in Alaska, Hawaii, Iowa, and Kansas.[36]\n\n\nOutside of the United States, Esso and Mobil are primarily used, with Esso operating in 14 countries and Mobil operating in 29 countries and regions.[37]\n\n\nIn Japan, ExxonMobil had a 22% stake in TonenGeneral Sekiyu K.K., a refining company that merged into Eneos in 2017.[38][39]\n\n\nExxonMobil's primary retail brands worldwide are Exxon, Esso, Mobil, with the former being used exclusively in the United States and the latter two being used in most other countries where ExxonMobil operates. Esso is the only one of its brands not used widely in the United States. Since 2008, Mobil is the only brand for the company lubricants. Since 2018, ExxonMobil has operated a loyalty program, ExxonMobil Rewards+, where customers earn rewards points when filling up at its stations in the United States and later the United Kingdom.[40][41][42]\n\n\n\n#### Chemicals[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nExxonMobil Chemical is a petrochemical company that was created by merging Exxon's and Mobil's chemical industries in 1999. Its principal products include basic olefins and aromatics, ethylene glycol, polyethylene, and polypropylene along with speciality lines such as elastomers, plasticizers, solvents, process fluids, oxo alcohols and adhesive resins. The company also produces synthetic lubricant base stocks as well as lubricant additives, propylene packaging films and catalysts. ExxonMobil is the largest producer of butyl rubber.[43] Infineum, a joint venture with Shell plc, is manufacturing and marketing crankcase lubricant additives, fuel additives, and specialty lubricant additives, as well as automatic transmission fluids, gear oils, and industrial oils.[44]\n\n\n\n#### Sponsorships[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mobil 1\n\nMobil 1, a brand of synthetic motor oil, is a major sponsor of multiple racing teams and as the official motor oil of NASCAR since 2003.[45] ExxonMobil is currently in partnerships with Oracle Red Bull Racing in Formula One and Kalitta Motorsports.[46][47][48]\n\n\n\n#### Refineries[edit]\n\n\nExxonMobil operates 21 refineries worldwide, and the company claims 80% of its refining capacity is integrated with chemical or lube basestocks. ExxonMobil's largest refinery in the United States is its Baytown Refinery, located in Baytown, Texas, and its largest refinery overall is its Jurong Island facility in Singapore; these two refineries combined output over 1.15 million barrels of oil per day. In 2021, ExxonMobil's global average refining capacity was 4.6 million barrels per day, with the United States producing a plurality of the company's refining capacity at about 1.77 million barrels per day. ExxonMobil's corporate website claims it refines almost 5 million barrels per day.[49][50][51][52]\n\n\nExxonMobil was one of few U.S. refiners to expand capacity by a significant margin following an industry downturn suffered during the COVID-19 pandemic.[53] The company completed a 250,000 barrels per day expansion at its Beaumont, Texas, refinery in early 2023.[54]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Low Carbon Solutions[edit]\n\n\nOfficially formed with ExxonMobil's 2022 corporate restructuring, and currently led by former General Motors president Dan Ammann, Low Carbon Solutions is the company's alternative energy division. The division intends to lower emissions in hard-to-decarbonize sectors such as heavy industry, commercial transportation, and power generation using a combination of lower-emission fuels, hydrogen, and carbon capture and storage. Low Carbon Solutions conducts research on clean energy technologies, including algae biofuels, biodiesel made from agricultural waste, carbonate fuel cells, and refining crude oil into plastic by using a membrane and osmosis instead of heat.[55][56] The company speculated in April 2023 that pending good economic conditions, the low-carbon solutions business could eclipse the value of its oil and gas operations.[57]\n\n\nThe company is in the process of designing its inaugural large-scale plant dedicated to producing low-carbon hydrogen, situated within its refining and petrochemical complex in Baytown, Texas. This project is set to become the world's largest low-carbon hydrogen project.[58][59]\n\n\n\n#### Carbon capture and storage[edit]\n\n\nExxonMobil publicly announced it would be investing $15 billion in what it deemed a \"lower carbon future\", and claims to be the world leader in carbon capture and storage (CCS). The company additionally plans that its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions will be carbon neutral by 2050. ExxonMobil additionally acquired biofuel company Biojet AS in 2022, and its Canadian subsidiary Imperial Oil is moving ahead with plans to produce a renewable diesel biofuel.[60][61] In July 2023, Exxon agreed to acquire Denbury Resources for $4.9 billion to further its low-carbon efforts.[62]\n\n\n\n## Corporate affairs[edit]\n\n\nBig Oil companies[b]\n| Company\n | Revenue (USD)[63] | Profit (USD)\n | Brands\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ExxonMobil | $286 billion\n | $23 billion\n | MobilEssoImperial Oil |\n| Shell plc | $273 billion\n | $20 billion\n | Jiffy LubePennzoil |\n| TotalEnergies | $185 billion\n | $16 billion\n | Elf AquitaineSunPower |\n| BP | $164 billion\n | $7.6 billion\n | AmocoAral AG |\n| Chevron | $163 billion\n | $16 billion\n | TexacoCaltexHavoline |\n| Marathon | $141 billion\n | $10 billion\n | ARCO[64] |\n| Phillips 66 | $115 billion\n | $1.3 billion\n | 76ConocoJET |\n| Valero | $108 billion\n | $0.9 billion\n | \u2014\n |\n| Eni | $77 billion\n | $5.8 billion\n | \u2014\n |\n| ConocoPhillips | $48.3 billion\n | $8.1 billion\n | \u2014\n |\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n### Financial data[edit]\n\n\nAccording to *Fortune* Global 500, ExxonMobil was the second largest company, second largest publicly held corporation, and the largest oil company in the United States by 2017 revenue.[65] For the fiscal year 2020, ExxonMobil reported a loss of US$22.4\u00a0billion, with an annual revenue of US$181.5\u00a0billion, a decline of 31.5% over the previous fiscal cycle.[66]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Revenue(mln.

Former ExxonMobil offices in Downtown Houston were vacated in early 2015.\nExxonMobil's headquarters are located in Spring, Texas, a suburb of Houston.[78][79]\n\n\nThe company decided to consolidate its Houston operations into one new campus located in northern Harris County and vacate its offices on 800 Bell St. which it had occupied since 1963.[80] The new operation complex includes twenty office buildings totaling 3,000,000 square feet (280,000\u00a0m2), a wellness center, laboratory, and three parking garages.[81] It is designed to house nearly 10,000 employees.\n\n\n\n### Board of directors[edit]\n\n\nThe current chairman of the board and CEO of ExxonMobil Corp. is Darren W. Woods. Woods was elected chairman of the board and CEO effective January 1, 2017, after the retirement of former chairman and CEO Rex Tillerson. Before his election as chairman and CEO, Woods was elected president of ExxonMobil and a member of the board of directors in 2016.[82]\n\n\nAs of July\u00a028, 2021[update], the current ExxonMobil board members are:[83]\n\n\n\n* Michael J. Angelakis, chair and chief executive officer of Atairos Group Inc.\n* Susan Avery, president emerita of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution\n* Angela Braly, former president and CEO of WellPoint (now Anthem)\n* Ursula Burns, former chair and CEO of Xerox\n* Gregory J.

Ubben, Founder, Portfolio Manager, and Managing Partner, Inclusive Capital Partners, L.P.\n* Darren W. Woods, chair of the board and CEO, ExxonMobil Corporation\n\n\nHooley is presently the lead independent director, having succeeded former Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier upon his retirement in May 2022.[84] Three of the directors nominated at the last Annual General Meeting were nominated after a proxy battle against hedge fund Engine No.1 and were nominated against the suggestion of the board.[85]\n\n\n\n### Key Executives[edit]\n\n\nExxonMobil's key executives are:[86]\n\n\n\n* Darren Woods, chairman and CEO\n* Neil Chapman, Senior Vice President\n* Kathryn Mikells, CFO and Senior Vice President\n* Jack Williams, Senior Vice President\n* James Spellings, General Tax Counsel and Vice President\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Criticism of ExxonMobil\n\n![](image)Extinction Rebellion protestors demonstrating against ExxonMobil\n### Climate change denial[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: ExxonMobil climate change denial\n\nExxonMobil's environmental record has faced much criticism for its stance[87] and impact on global warming.[88] In 2018, the Political Economy Research Institute ranks ExxonMobil tenth among American corporations emitting airborne pollutants,[89] thirteenth by emitting greenhouse gases,[90] and sixteenth by emitting water pollutants.[91] A 2017 report places ExxonMobil as the fifth largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions from 1988 to 2015.[92][93] As of 2005[update], ExxonMobil had committed less than 1% of their profits towards researching alternative energy,[94] which, according to the advocacy organization Ceres, is less than other leading oil companies.[95][*needs update*] According to the 2021 Arctic Environmental Responsibility Index (AERI), ExxonMobil is ranked as the sixth most environmentally responsible company among 120 oil, gas, and mining companies involved in resource extraction north of the Arctic Circle.[96] The company's activities gained international notoriety from many incidents, most notably the *Exxon Valdez* oil spill in 1989. As of 2020, ExxonMobil has been responsible for more than 3,000 oil spills and leakages which resulted in a loss of more than one barrel of oil, with the most in a single year being 484 spills in 2011.[97] Additionally, since 1965, ExxonMobil has released more than 40 billion tons of carbon dioxide pollution.[98]\n\n\nIn 2023, *Science* journal published a paper reporting that the global warming projections and models created by ExxonMobil's own scientists between 1977 and 2003 had \"accurately\" projected and \"skillfully\" modeled global warming due to fossil fuel burning, and had reasonably estimated how much CO2 would lead to dangerous warming. The authors of the paper concluded: \"Yet, whereas academic and government scientists worked to communicate what they knew to the public, ExxonMobil worked to deny it.\"[99][100]\n\n\nBetween the 1980s and 2014, ExxonMobil was a notable denier of climate change, though the company officially changed its position in 2014 to acknowledge the existence of climate change. ExxonMobil's prolonged response incited the creation of the *Exxon Knew* movement, which aims to hold the company accountable for various climate-related incidents. ExxonMobil has used its own website to attack *Exxon Knew*, claiming that it is a coordinated effort to defame the company.[101][102][103][104]\n\n\nIn December 2022, U.S. House Oversight and Reform Committee Chair Carolyn Maloney and U.S. House Oversight Environment Subcommittee Chair Ro Khanna sent a memorandum to all House Oversight and Reform Committee members summarizing additional findings from the committee's investigation into the fossil fuel industry disinformation campaign to obscure the role of fossil fuels in causing global warming. Upon reviewing internal company documents, they accused ExxonMobil along with BP, Chevron, and Shell of greenwashing their Paris Agreement carbon neutrality pledges while continuing long-term investment in fossil fuel production and sales, for engaging in a campaign to promote the use of natural gas as a clean energy source and bridge fuel to renewable energy, and of intimidating journalists reporting about the companies' climate actions and of obstructing the committee's investigation, which ExxonMobil, Shell, and the American Petroleum Institute denied.[105][106][107]\n\n\n\n### Oil spills and plastic pollution[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Exxon Valdez oil spill cleanup\nExxonMobil's operations have been subject to numerous oil spills both before and after the 1999 merger. The most widely publicized oil spill was the 1989 *Valdez* oil spill, where an Exxon tanker discharged approximately 11 million U.S. gallons (42,000 m3) of oil into Prince William Sound,[108] oiling 1,300 miles (2,100\u00a0km) of the remote Alaskan coastline. The spill remains the second largest in American history, only trailing BP's *Deepwater Horizon* spill in the Gulf of Mexico.[109]\n\n\nExxonMobil was also responsible for various other oil spills across the world. Some of Exxon's largest and most notable oil spills in the United States include long-lasting oil leaks totaling into an estimated 30 million gallon spill into New York City's Newtown Creek over the course of a century by Exxon and other Standard Oil predecessors,[110] a 2011 oil spill which leaked 1,500 barrels of oil into the Yellowstone River (resulting in about $135 million in damages),[111] and a 2012 1,900 barrel (80,000 gallon) spill from the company's Baton Rouge Refinery in the rivers of Point Coupee Parish, Louisiana.[112] ExxonMobil's actives in Louisiana in particular, especially its Baton Rouge Refinery, have given the area the nickname of *Cancer Alley*. The company's activities, along with other operations and refineries in the area, have been the source of increased cancer infections, lower air quality, and as seen by some, potential environmental racism committed by the company.[113][114]\n\n\nIn May 2021, ExxonMobil topped the Plastic Waste Makers Index report published by the Minderoo Foundation of 20 petrochemical companies that manufactured 55 percent of the single-use plastic waste in the world in 2019 (which were part of a larger group of 100 petrochemical companies that manufactured 90 percent of the waste),[115][116] while in April 2022, California Attorney General Rob Bonta issued a subpoena to ExxonMobil for information related to the company's role in overstating the effectiveness of plastic recycling in reducing plastic pollution as part of an industry campaign to promote plastic usage.[117][118][119]\n\n\n\n### Geopolitical influence and human rights violations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Conflict in the Niger Delta\n\n![](image)Former CEO Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State, with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, May 2017\nExxonMobil has also been accused of human rights violations and abusing its geopolitical influence.[20] In the book *Private Empire* by Steve Coll, ExxonMobil is described as extremely powerful \"corporate state within the American state\" in dealing with the countries in which it drills, going to the point as describing such countries' governments as \"constrained\".[120] The company's corporate ancestors are also blamed for the outbreak of the 1954 Jebel Akhdar War, which was sparked by the Iraq Petroleum Company's activities.[121][122]\n\n\n\n#### Indonesia[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Accusations of ExxonMobil human rights violations in Aceh\n\nBeginning in the late 1980s, ExxonMobil (through predecessor Mobil) hired military units of the Indonesian National Army to provide security for their gas extraction and liquefaction project in Aceh, Indonesia, and these military units were accused of committing human rights violations. ExxonMobil eventually pulled out from Indonesia completely in 2001, while denying any wrongdoing.[123]\n\n\n\n### Other controversies[edit]\n\n\nDuring a 2022 surge in profits among ExxonMobil and other large oil companies, partly due to the war in Ukraine,[124][125] U.S. President Joe Biden criticized ExxonMobil. In June 2022, amid record oil prices, he said that \"Exxon made more money than God this year\".[126] When the oil giant reported its second quarter earnings in 2022, CNN reported that Exxon made US$2,245.62 per second in profit across the 92-day long second quarter.[127]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Esso\n* History of ExxonMobil\n* Litigation involving ExxonMobil:\n\t+ *Connecticut v.

Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus *Malus*. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, *Malus sieversii*, is still found. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe and were introduced to North America by European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek, and European Christian tradition.\n\n\nApples grown from seed tend to be very different from those of their parents, and the resultant fruit frequently lacks desired characteristics. For commercial purposes, including botanical evaluation, apple cultivars are propagated by clonal grafting onto rootstocks. Apple trees grown without rootstocks tend to be larger and much slower to fruit after planting. Rootstocks are used to control the speed of growth and the size of the resulting tree, allowing for easier harvesting.\n\n\nThere are more than 7,500 cultivars of apples.[*citation needed*] Different cultivars are bred for various tastes and uses, including cooking, eating raw, and cider or apple juice production. Trees and fruit are prone to fungal, bacterial, and pest problems, which can be controlled by a number of organic and non-organic means. In 2010, the fruit's genome was sequenced as part of research on disease control and selective breeding in apple production.\n\n\nWorldwide production of apples in 2021 was 93 million tonnes, with China accounting for nearly half of the total.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nThe word *apple*, whose Old English ancestor is *\u00e6ppel*, is descended from the Proto-Germanic noun \\**aplaz*, descended in turn from Proto-Indo-European \\**h\u2082\u00e9b\u014dl*.[4]\n\n\nAs late as the 17th century, the word also functioned as a generic term for all fruit including nuts\u2014such as the 14th-century Middle English expression *appel of paradis*, meaning a banana.[5]\n\n\n\n## Description[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A chart demonstrating apple morphology\n![](image)Blossoms, fruits, and leaves of the apple tree (*Malus domestica*)\nThe apple is a deciduous tree, generally standing 2 to 4.5\u00a0m (6 to 15\u00a0ft) tall in cultivation and up to 9\u00a0m (30\u00a0ft) in the wild. When cultivated, the size, shape and branch density are determined by rootstock selection and trimming method. The leaves are alternately arranged dark green-colored simple ovals with serrated margins and slightly downy undersides.[6]\n\n\n\n![](image)Apple blossoms\nBlossoms are produced in spring simultaneously with the budding of the leaves and are produced on spurs and some long shoots. The 3 to 4\u00a0cm (1 to 1+1\u20442\u00a0in) flowers are white with a pink tinge that gradually fades, five petaled, with an inflorescence consisting of a cyme with 4\u20136 flowers. The central flower of the inflorescence is called the \"king bloom\"; it opens first and can develop a larger fruit.[6][7]\n\n\nThe fruit is a pome that matures in late summer or autumn, and cultivars exist in a wide range of sizes. Commercial growers aim to produce an apple that is 7 to 8.5\u00a0cm (2+3\u20444 to 3+1\u20444\u00a0in) in diameter, due to market preference. Some consumers, especially in Japan, prefer a larger apple, while apples less than 5.5\u00a0cm (2+1\u20444\u00a0in) are generally used for juicing and have little fresh market value.\n\n\n\n### Skin[edit]\n\n\n![](image)0% overcolor\n![](image)100% overcolor\nThe groundcolor of ripe apples is yellow, green, yellow-green or whitish yellow. The overcolor of ripe apples can be orange-red, pink-red, red, purple-red or brown-red. The skin can also be russetted. The overcolor amount can be 0-100%. [8] The skin may also be wholly or partly russeted i.e. rough and brown. The skin is covered in a protective layer of epicuticular wax.[9] The exocarp (flesh) is generally pale yellowish-white,[8] though pink, yellow or green exocarps also occur.\n\n\n\n### Wild ancestors[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Malus sieversii\n\nThe original wild ancestor of *Malus domestica* was *Malus sieversii*, found growing wild in the mountains of Central Asia in southern Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and northwestern China.[6][10] Cultivation of the species, most likely beginning on the forested flanks of the Tian Shan mountains, progressed over a long period of time and permitted secondary introgression of genes from other species into the open-pollinated seeds. Significant exchange with *Malus sylvestris*, the crabapple, resulted in populations of apples being more related to crabapples than to the more morphologically similar progenitor *Malus sieversii*. In strains without recent admixture the contribution of the latter predominates.[11][12][13]\n\n\n\n### Aroma in apples[edit]\n\n\nImportant volatile compounds in apples include acetaldehyde, ethyl acetate, 1-butanal, ethanol, 2-methylbutanal, 3-methylbutanal, ethyl propionate, ethyl 2-methylpropionate, ethyl butyrate, ethyl 2-methyl butyrate, hexanal, 1-butanol, 3-methylbutyl acetate, 2-methylbutyl acetate, 1-propyl butyrate, ethyl pentanoate, amyl acetate, 2-methyl-1-butanol, trans-2-hexenal, ethyl hexanoate, hexanol. [14][15]\n\n\n\n### Genome[edit]\n\n\nApples are diploid (though triploid cultivars are not uncommon), have 17 chromosomes and an estimated genome size of approximately 650 Mb. Several whole genome sequences have been completed and made available. The first one in 2010 was based on the diploid cultivar 'Golden Delicious'.[16] However, this first whole genome sequence turned out to contain several errors[17] in part owing to the high degree of heterozygosity in diploid apples which, in combination with an ancient genome duplication, complicated the assembly. Recently, double- and trihaploid individuals have been sequenced, yielding whole genome sequences of higher quality.[18][19]\n\n\nThe first whole genome assembly was estimated to contain around 57,000 genes,[16] though the more recent genome sequences support estimates between 42,000 and 44,700 protein-coding genes.[18][19] The availability of whole genome sequences has provided evidence that the wild ancestor of the cultivated apple most likely is *Malus sieversii*. Re-sequencing of multiple accessions has supported this, while also suggesting extensive introgression from *Malus sylvestris* following domestication.[20]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![color photograph of a hand holding a red apple](image)Wild *Malus sieversii* apple in Kazakhstan\n![](image)\n\n\"Wild Apples\"  \nby Henry David Thoreau  \nRead by Kevin S for LibriVox\n\n\nAudio 01:01:35 (full text)\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file? See media help.*\n\n*Malus sieversii* is recognized as a major progenitor species to the cultivated apple, and is morphologically similar. Due to the genetic variability in Central Asia, this region is generally considered the center of origin for apples.[21] The apple is thought to have been domesticated 4000\u201310000 years ago in the Tian Shan mountains, and then to have travelled along the Silk Road to Europe, with hybridization and introgression of wild crabapples from Siberia (*M. baccata*), the Caucasus (*M. orientalis*), and Europe (*M. sylvestris*). Only the *M. sieversii* trees growing on the western side of the Tian Shan mountains contributed genetically to the domesticated apple, not the isolated population on the eastern side.[20]\n\n\nChinese soft apples, such as *M. asiatica* and *M. prunifolia*, have been cultivated as dessert apples for more than 2000 years in China. These are thought to be hybrids between *M. baccata* and *M. sieversii* in Kazakhstan.[20]\n\n\nAmong the traits selected for by human growers are size, fruit acidity, color, firmness, and soluble sugar. Unusually for domesticated fruits, the wild *M. sieversii* origin is only slightly smaller than the modern domesticated apple.[20]\n\n\nAt the Sammardenchia-Cueis site near Udine in Northeastern Italy, seeds from some form of apples have been found in material carbon dated to around 4000 BCE.[22] Genetic analysis has not yet been successfully used to determine whether such ancient apples were wild *Malus sylvestris* or *Malus domesticus* containing *Malus sieversii* ancestry.[23] It is generally also hard to distinguish in the archeological record between foraged wild apples and apple plantations.\n\n\nThere is indirect evidence of apple cultivation in the third millennium BCE in the Middle East. There was substantial apple production in the European classical antiquity, and grafting was certainly known then.[23] Grafting is an essential part of modern domesticated apple production, to be able to propagate the best cultivars; it is unclear when apple tree grafting was invented.[23]\n\n\nWinter apples, picked in late autumn and stored just above freezing, have been an important food in Asia and Europe for millennia.[24]\nOf the many Old World plants that the Spanish introduced to Chilo\u00e9 Archipelago in the 16th century, apple trees became particularly well adapted.[25] Apples were introduced to North America by colonists in the 17th century,[6] and the first apple orchard on the North American continent was planted in Boston by Reverend William Blaxton in 1625.[26] The only apples native to North America are crab apples, which were once called \"common apples\".[27]\n\n\nApple cultivars brought as seed from Europe were spread along Native American trade routes, as well as being cultivated on colonial farms. An 1845 United States apples nursery catalogue sold 350 of the \"best\" cultivars, showing the proliferation of new North American cultivars by the early 19th century.[27] In the 20th century, irrigation projects in Eastern Washington began and allowed the development of the multibillion-dollar fruit industry, of which the apple is the leading product.[6]\n\n\nUntil the 20th century, farmers stored apples in frostproof cellars during the winter for their own use or for sale. Improved transportation of fresh apples by train and road replaced the necessity for storage.[28][29] Controlled atmosphere facilities are used to keep apples fresh year-round. Controlled atmosphere facilities use high humidity, low oxygen, and controlled carbon dioxide levels to maintain fruit freshness. They were first used in the United States in the 1960s.[30]\n\n\n\n## Significance in European cultures and societies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Apple (symbolism)\n\n### Germanic paganism[edit]\n\n\n![Illustration of girl in a red dress, holding 3 candles in one hand and a basket of apples in the other](image)\"Brita as Iduna\" (1901) by Carl Larsson\nIn Norse mythology, the goddess I\u00f0unn is portrayed in the *Prose Edda* (written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson) as providing apples to the gods that give them eternal youthfulness. The English scholar H. R. Ellis Davidson links apples to religious practices in Germanic paganism, from which Norse paganism developed. She points out that buckets of apples were found in the Oseberg ship burial site in Norway, that fruit and nuts (I\u00f0unn having been described as being transformed into a nut in *Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l*) have been found in the early graves of the Germanic peoples in England and elsewhere on the continent of Europe, which may have had a symbolic meaning, and that nuts are still a recognized symbol of fertility in southwest England.[31]\n\n\nDavidson notes a connection between apples and the Vanir, a tribe of gods associated with fertility in Norse mythology, citing an instance of eleven \"golden apples\" being given to woo the beautiful Ger\u00f0r by Sk\u00edrnir, who was acting as messenger for the major Vanir god Freyr in stanzas 19 and 20 of *Sk\u00edrnism\u00e1l*. Davidson also notes a further connection between fertility and apples in Norse mythology in chapter 2 of the *V\u00f6lsunga saga*: when the major goddess Frigg sends King Rerir an apple after he prays to Odin for a child, Frigg's messenger (in the guise of a crow) drops the apple in his lap as he sits atop a mound.[32] Rerir's wife's consumption of the apple results in a six-year pregnancy and the birth (by Caesarean section) of their son\u2014the hero V\u00f6lsung.[33]\n\n\nFurther, Davidson points out the \"strange\" phrase \"Apples of Hel\" used in an 11th-century poem by the skald Thorbiorn Br\u00fanarson. She states this may imply that the apple was thought of by Br\u00fanarson as the food of the dead. Further, Davidson notes that the potentially Germanic goddess Nehalennia is sometimes depicted with apples and that parallels exist in early Irish stories. Davidson asserts that while cultivation of the apple in Northern Europe extends back to at least the time of the Roman Empire and came to Europe from the Near East, the native varieties of apple trees growing in Northern Europe are small and bitter. Davidson concludes that in the figure of I\u00f0unn \"we must have a dim reflection of an old symbol: that of the guardian goddess of the life-giving fruit of the other world.\"[31]\n\n\n\n### Greek mythology[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Heracles with the apple of Hesperides\nApples appear in many religious traditions, often as a mystical or forbidden fruit. One of the problems identifying apples in religion, mythology and folktales is that the word \"apple\" was used as a generic term for all (foreign) fruit, other than berries, including nuts, as late as the 17th century.[34] For instance, in Greek mythology, the Greek hero Heracles, as a part of his Twelve Labours, was required to travel to the Garden of the Hesperides and pick the golden apples off the Tree of Life growing at its center.[35][36][37]\n\n\n\n![](image)*The Judgment of Paris* by Enrique Simonet, which depicts Paris deciding which of the three goddesses (Hera, Athene, and Aphrodite) he should give the Golden Apple.\nThe Greek goddess of discord, Eris, became disgruntled after she was excluded from the wedding of Peleus and Thetis.[38] In retaliation, she tossed a golden apple inscribed \u039a\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7 (*Kalliste*, sometimes transliterated *Kallisti*, \"For the most beautiful one\"), into the wedding party. Three goddesses claimed the apple: Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite. Paris of Troy was appointed to select the recipient. After being bribed by both Hera and Athena, Aphrodite tempted him with the most beautiful woman in the world, Helen of Sparta. He awarded the apple to Aphrodite, thus indirectly causing the Trojan War.[39]\n\n\nThe apple was thus considered, in ancient Greece, sacred to Aphrodite. To throw an apple at someone was to symbolically declare one's love; and similarly, to catch it was to symbolically show one's acceptance of that love. An epigram claiming authorship by Plato states:[40]\n\n\n\n\n> I throw the apple at you, and if you are willing to love me, take it and share your girlhood with me; but if your thoughts are what I pray they are not, even then take it, and consider how short-lived is beauty.\n> \n> \u2014\u200aPlato, Epigram VII\n> \n\n\nAtalanta, also of Greek mythology, raced all her suitors in an attempt to avoid marriage. She outran all but Hippomenes (also known as Melanion, a name possibly derived from *melon*, the Greek word for both \"apple\" and fruit in general),[36] who defeated her by cunning, not speed. Hippomenes knew that he could not win in a fair race, so he used three golden apples (gifts of Aphrodite, the goddess of love) to distract Atalanta. It took all three apples and all of his speed, but Hippomenes was finally successful, winning the race and Atalanta's hand.[35]\n\n\n\n### Christian art[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Adam and Eve* by Albrecht D\u00fcrer (1507), showcasing the apple as a symbol of sin\nThough the forbidden fruit of Eden in the Book of Genesis is not identified, popular Christian tradition has held that it was an apple that Eve coaxed Adam to share with her.[41] The origin of the popular identification with a fruit unknown in the Middle East in biblical times is found in wordplay with the Latin words *m\u0101lum* (an apple) and *m\u0103lum* (an evil), each of which is normally written *malum*.[42] The tree of the forbidden fruit is called \"the tree of the knowledge of good and evil\" in Genesis 2:17,[43] and the Latin for \"good and evil\" is *bonum et malum*.[44]\n\n\nRenaissance painters may also have been influenced by the story of the golden apples in the Garden of Hesperides. As a result, in the story of Adam and Eve, the apple became a symbol for knowledge, immortality, temptation, the fall of man into sin, and sin itself. The larynx in the human throat has been called the \"Adam's apple\" because of a notion that it was caused by the forbidden fruit remaining in the throat of Adam.[41] The apple as symbol of sexual seduction has been used to imply human sexuality, possibly in an ironic vein.[41]\n\n\n\n### Proverb[edit]\n\n\nThe proverb, \"An apple a day keeps the doctor away\", addressing the supposed health benefits of the fruit, has been traced to 19th-century Wales, where the original phrase was \"Eat an apple on going to bed, and you'll keep the doctor from earning his bread\".[45] In the 19th century and early 20th, the phrase evolved to \"an apple a day, no doctor to pay\" and \"an apple a day sends the doctor away\"; the phrasing now commonly used was first recorded in 1922.[46]\n\n\n\n## Cultivars[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of apple cultivars\n\nThere are more than 7,500 known cultivars (cultivated varieties) of apples.[47] Cultivars vary in their yield and the ultimate size of the tree, even when grown on the same rootstock.[48] Different cultivars are available for temperate and subtropical climates. The UK's National Fruit Collection, which is the responsibility of the Department of Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs, includes a collection of over 2,000 cultivars of apple tree in Kent.[49] The University of Reading, which is responsible for developing the UK national collection database, provides access to search the national collection. The University of Reading's work is part of the European Cooperative Programme for Plant Genetic Resources of which there are 38 countries participating in the Malus/Pyrus work group.[50]\n\n\nThe UK's national fruit collection database contains much information on the characteristics and origin of many apples, including alternative names for what is essentially the same \"genetic\" apple cultivar. Most of these cultivars are bred for eating fresh (dessert apples), though some are cultivated specifically for cooking (cooking apples) or producing cider. Cider apples are typically too tart and astringent to eat fresh, but they give the beverage a rich flavor that dessert apples cannot.[51]\n\n\nCommercially popular apple cultivars are soft but crisp. Other desirable qualities in modern commercial apple breeding are a colorful skin, absence of russeting, ease of shipping, lengthy storage ability, high yields, disease resistance, common apple shape, and developed flavor.[48] Modern apples are generally sweeter than older cultivars, as popular tastes in apples have varied over time. Most North Americans and Europeans favor sweet, subacid apples, but tart apples have a strong minority following.[52] Extremely sweet apples with barely any acid flavor are popular in Asia,[52] especially the Indian subcontinent.[51]\n\n\nOld cultivars are often oddly shaped, russeted, and grow in a variety of textures and colors. Some find them to have better flavor than modern cultivars,[53] but they may have other problems that make them commercially unviable\u2014low yield, disease susceptibility, poor tolerance for storage or transport, or just being the \"wrong\" size. A few old cultivars are still produced on a large scale, but many have been preserved by home gardeners and farmers that sell directly to local markets. Many unusual and locally important cultivars with their own unique taste and appearance exist; apple conservation campaigns have sprung up around the world to preserve such local cultivars from extinction. In the United Kingdom, old cultivars such as 'Cox's Orange Pippin' and 'Egremont Russet' are still commercially important even though by modern standards they are low yielding and susceptible to disease.[6]\n\n\n\n* !['Alice'](image)\n\n'Alice'\n* !['Ambrosia'](image)\n\n'Ambrosia'\n* !['Ananasrenette'](image)\n\n'Ananasrenette'\n* !['Arkansas Black'](image)\n\n'Arkansas Black'\n* !['Aroma'](image)\n\n'Aroma'\n* !['Belle de Boskoop'](image)\n\n'Belle de Boskoop'\n* !['Bramley'](image)\n\n'Bramley'\n* !['Cox's Orange Pippin'](image)\n\n'Cox's Orange Pippin'\n* !['Cox Pomona'](image)\n\n'Cox Pomona'\n* !['Cripps Pink'](image)\n\n'Cripps Pink'\n* !['Discovery'](image)\n\n'Discovery'\n* !['Egremont Russet'](image)\n\n'Egremont Russet'\n* !['Fuji'](image)\n\n'Fuji'\n* !['Gala'](image)\n\n'Gala'\n* !['Gloster'](image)\n\n'Gloster'\n* !['Golden Delicious'](image)\n\n'Golden Delicious'\n* !['Goldrenette' (Reinette)](image)\n\n'Goldrenette' (Reinette)\n* !['Granny Smith'](image)\n\n'Granny Smith'\n* !['Honeycrisp'](image)\n\n'Honeycrisp'\n* !['James Grieve'](image)\n\n'James Grieve'\n* !['Jonagold'](image)\n\n'Jonagold'\n* !['Lobo'](image)\n\n'Lobo'\n* !['McIntosh'](image)\n\n'McIntosh'\n* !['Sciros'](image)\n\n'Sciros'\n* !['Red Delicious'](image)\n\n'Red Delicious'\n* !['Sampion' (Shampion)](image)\n\n'Sampion' (Shampion)\n* !['Stark Delicious'](image)\n\n'Stark Delicious'\n* !['SugarBee'](image)\n\n'SugarBee'\n* !['Summerred'](image)\n\n'Summerred'\n* !['Tellissaare'](image)\n\n'Tellissaare'\n* !['Yellow Transparent'](image)\n\n'Yellow Transparent'\n\n\n## Cultivation[edit]\n\n\n### Breeding[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Fruit tree propagation and Malling series\n\n![](image)An apple tree in Germany\nMany apples grow readily from seeds. However, more than with most perennial fruits, apples must be propagated asexually to obtain the sweetness and other desirable characteristics of the parent. This is because seedling apples are an example of \"extreme heterozygotes\", in that rather than inheriting genes from their parents to create a new apple with parental characteristics, they are instead significantly different from their parents, perhaps to compete with the many pests.[54] Triploid cultivars have an additional reproductive barrier in that three sets of chromosomes cannot be divided evenly during meiosis, yielding unequal segregation of the chromosomes (aneuploids). Even in the case when a triploid plant can produce a seed (apples are an example), it occurs infrequently, and seedlings rarely survive.[55]\n\n\nBecause apples are not true breeders when planted as seeds, although cuttings can take root and breed true, and may live for a century, grafting is usually used. The rootstock used for the bottom of the graft can be selected to produce trees of a large variety of sizes, as well as changing the winter hardiness, insect and disease resistance, and soil preference of the resulting tree. Dwarf rootstocks can be used to produce very small trees (less than 3.0\u00a0m or 10\u00a0ft high at maturity), which bear fruit many years earlier in their life cycle than full size trees, and are easier to harvest.[56]\n\n\nDwarf rootstocks for apple trees can be traced as far back as 300 BCE, to the area of Persia and Asia Minor. Alexander the Great sent samples of dwarf apple trees to Aristotle's Lyceum. Dwarf rootstocks became common by the 15th century and later went through several cycles of popularity and decline throughout the world.[57] The majority of the rootstocks used to control size in apples were developed in England in the early 1900s. The East Malling Research Station conducted extensive research into rootstocks, and their rootstocks are given an \"M\" prefix to designate their origin. Rootstocks marked with an \"MM\" prefix are Malling-series cultivars later crossed with trees of 'Northern Spy' in Merton, England.[58]\n\n\nMost new apple cultivars originate as seedlings, which either arise by chance or are bred by deliberately crossing cultivars with promising characteristics.[59] The words \"seedling\", \"pippin\", and \"kernel\" in the name of an apple cultivar suggest that it originated as a seedling. Apples can also form bud sports (mutations on a single branch). Some bud sports turn out to be improved strains of the parent cultivar. Some differ sufficiently from the parent tree to be considered new cultivars.[60]\n\n\nSince the 1930s, the Excelsior Experiment Station at the University of Minnesota has introduced a steady progression of important apples that are widely grown, both commercially and by local orchardists, throughout Minnesota and Wisconsin. Its most important contributions have included 'Haralson' (which is the most widely cultivated apple in Minnesota), 'Wealthy', 'Honeygold', and 'Honeycrisp'.\n\n\nApples have been acclimatized in Ecuador at very high altitudes, where they can often, with the needed factors, provide crops twice per year because of constant temperate conditions year-round.[61]\n\n\n\n### Pollination[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Fruit tree pollination\n\n![](image)Apple blossom from an old Ayrshire cultivar\n![](image)An orchard mason bee on an apple bloom in British Columbia, Canada\nApples are self-incompatible; they must cross-pollinate to develop fruit. During the flowering each season, apple growers often utilize pollinators to carry pollen. Honey bees are most commonly used. Orchard mason bees are also used as supplemental pollinators in commercial orchards. Bumblebee queens are sometimes present in orchards, but not usually in sufficient number to be significant pollinators.[60][62]\n\n\nThere are four to seven pollination groups in apples, depending on climate:\n\n\n\n* Group A \u2013 Early flowering, 1 to 3 May in England ('Gravenstein', 'Red Astrachan')\n* Group B \u2013 4 to 7 May ('Idared', 'McIntosh')\n* Group C \u2013 Mid-season flowering, 8 to 11 May ('Granny Smith', 'Cox's Orange Pippin')\n* Group D \u2013 Mid/late season flowering, 12 to 15 May ('Golden Delicious', 'Calville blanc d'hiver')\n* Group E \u2013 Late flowering, 16 to 18 May ('Braeburn', 'Reinette d'Orl\u00e9ans')\n* Group F \u2013 19 to 23 May ('Suntan')\n* Group H \u2013 24 to 28 May ('Court-Pendu Gris' \u2013 also called Court-Pendu plat)\n\n\nOne cultivar can be pollinated by a compatible cultivar from the same group or close (A with A, or A with B, but not A with C or D).[63]\n\n\nCultivars are sometimes classified by the day of peak bloom in the average 30-day blossom period, with pollenizers selected from cultivars within a 6-day overlap period.\n\n\n\n### Maturation and harvest[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Fruit picking and Fruit tree pruning\n\n![](image)L. K. Relander, the former President of Finland, with his family picking apples in the 1930s\nCultivars vary in their yield and the ultimate size of the tree, even when grown on the same rootstock. Some cultivars, if left unpruned, grow very large\u2014letting them bear more fruit, but making harvesting more difficult. Depending on tree density (number of trees planted per unit surface area), mature trees typically bear 40\u2013200\u00a0kg (90\u2013440\u00a0lb) of apples each year, though productivity can be close to zero in poor years. Apples are harvested using three-point ladders that are designed to fit amongst the branches. Trees grafted on dwarfing rootstocks bear about 10\u201380\u00a0kg (20\u2013180\u00a0lb) of fruit per year.[60]\n\n\nFarms with apple orchards open them to the public so consumers can pick their own apples.[64]\n\n\nCrops ripen at different times of the year according to the cultivar. Cultivar that yield their crop in the summer include 'Gala', 'Golden Supreme', 'McIntosh', 'Transparent', 'Primate', 'Sweet Bough', and 'Duchess'; fall producers include 'Fuji', 'Jonagold', 'Golden Delicious', 'Red Delicious', 'Chenango', 'Gravenstein', 'Wealthy', 'McIntosh', 'Snow', and 'Blenheim'; winter producers include 'Winesap', 'Granny Smith', 'King', 'Wagener', 'Swayzie', 'Greening', and 'Tolman Sweet'.[27]\n\n\n\n### Storage[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Different kinds of apple cultivars in a wholesale food market\nCommercially, apples can be stored for a few months in controlled atmosphere chambers to delay ethylene-induced ripening. Apples are commonly stored in chambers with higher concentrations of carbon dioxide and high air filtration. This prevents ethylene concentrations from rising to higher amounts and preventing ripening from occurring too quickly.\n\n\nFor home storage, most cultivars of apple can be held for approximately two weeks when kept at the coolest part of the refrigerator (i.e. below 5\u00a0\u00b0C). Some can be stored up to a year without significant degradation.[*dubious \u2013 discuss*][65][*verification needed*] Some varieties of apples (e.g. 'Granny Smith' and 'Fuji') have more than three times the storage life of others.[66]\n\n\nNon-organic apples may be sprayed with a substance 1-methylcyclopropene blocking the apples' ethylene receptors, temporarily preventing them from ripening.[67]\n\n\n\n### Pests and diseases[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of apple diseases\n\nSee also: List of Lepidoptera that feed on Malus\n\n![](image)Leaves with significant insect damage\nApple trees are susceptible to a number of fungal and bacterial diseases and insect pests. Many commercial orchards pursue a program of chemical sprays to maintain high fruit quality, tree health, and high yields. These prohibit the use of synthetic pesticides, though some older pesticides are allowed. Organic methods include, for instance, introducing its natural predator to reduce the population of a particular pest.\n\n\nA wide range of pests and diseases can affect the plant. Three of the more common diseases or pests are mildew, aphids, and apple scab.\n\n\n\n* Mildew is characterized by light grey powdery patches appearing on the leaves, shoots and flowers, normally in spring. The flowers turn a creamy yellow color and do not develop correctly. This can be treated similarly to *Botrytis*\u2014eliminating the conditions that caused the disease and burning the infected plants are among recommended actions.[68]\n* Aphids are a small insect. Five species of aphids commonly attack apples: apple grain aphid, rosy apple aphid, apple aphid, spirea aphid, and the woolly apple aphid. The aphid species can be identified by color, time of year, and by differences in the cornicles (small paired projections from their rear).[68] Aphids feed on foliage using needle-like mouth parts to suck out plant juices. When present in high numbers, certain species reduce tree growth and vigor.[69]\n* Apple scab: Apple scab causes leaves to develop olive-brown spots with a velvety texture that later turn brown and become cork-like in texture. The disease also affects the fruit, which also develops similar brown spots with velvety or cork-like textures. Apple scab is spread through fungus growing in old apple leaves on the ground and spreads during warm spring weather to infect the new year's growth.[70]\n\n\nAmong the most serious disease problems is a bacterial disease called fireblight, and three fungal diseases: *Gymnosporangium* rust, black spot,[69] and bitter rot.[71] Other pests that affect apple trees include Codling moths and apple maggots. Young apple trees are also prone to mammal pests like mice and deer, which feed on the soft bark of the trees, especially in winter.[70] The larvae of the apple clearwing moth (red-belted clearwing) burrow through the bark and into the phloem of apple trees, potentially causing significant damage.[72]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Apple production in 2021\n |\n| --- |\n| Country\n | Millions of tonnes |\n| ![](image)\u00a0China | 46.0\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0United States | 4.5\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Turkey | 4.5\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Poland | 4.1\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0India | 2.3\n |\n| **World** | **93.1** |\n| Source: FAOSTAT of the United Nations[3] |\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of countries by apple production\n\nWorld production of apples in 2021 was 93 million tonnes, with China producing 49% of the total (table).[3] Secondary producers were the United States and Turkey.[3]\n\n\n\n## Nutrition[edit]\n\n\n\n\nApples, with skin (edible parts)| Nutritional value per 100\u00a0g (3.5\u00a0oz) |\n| --- |\n| Energy | 218\u00a0kJ (52\u00a0kcal) |\n|  |\n| **Carbohydrates**\n | 13.81 g\n |\n| Sugars | 10.39 |\n| Dietary fiber | 2.4 g |\n|  |\n|  |\n| **Fat**\n | 0.17 g\n |\n|  |\n|  |\n| **Protein**\n | 0.26 g\n |\n|  |\n|  |\n| **Vitamins** | **Quantity** **%DV**\u2020\n |\n| Vitamin A equiv.beta-Carotene\nlutein zeaxanthin\n | 0%\n 3 \u03bcg0%\n27 \u03bcg\n29 \u03bcg\n |\n| Thiamine (B1) | 1%\n 0.017 mg |\n| Riboflavin (B2) | 2%\n 0.026 mg |\n| Niacin (B3) | 1%\n 0.091 mg |\n| Pantothenic acid (B5) | 1%\n 0.061 mg |\n| Vitamin B6 | 2%\n 0.041 mg |\n| Folate (B9) | 1%\n 3 \u03bcg |\n| Vitamin C | 5%\n 4.6 mg |\n| Vitamin E | 1%\n 0.18 mg |\n| Vitamin K | 2%\n 2.2 \u03bcg |\n|  |\n|  |\n| **Minerals** | **Quantity** **%DV**\u2020\n |\n| Calcium | 0%\n 6 mg |\n| Iron | 1%\n 0.12 mg |\n| Magnesium | 1%\n 5 mg |\n| Manganese | 2%\n 0.035 mg |\n| Phosphorus | 1%\n 11 mg |\n| Potassium | 4%\n 107 mg |\n| Sodium | 0%\n 1 mg |\n| Zinc | 0%\n 0.04 mg |\n|  |\n|  |\n| **Other constituents** | **Quantity** |\n| Water | 85.56 g |\n|  |\n| \n\n---\n\nLink to Full Nutrient Report of USDA Database entry\n |\n| \u2020Percentages estimated using US\u00a0recommendations for adults,[73] except for potassium, which is estimated based on expert recommendation from the National Academies.[74] |\n\n\nA raw apple is 86% water and 14% carbohydrates, with negligible content of fat and protein (table). A reference serving of a raw apple with skin weighing 100 grams provides 52 calories and a moderate content of dietary fiber.[75] Otherwise, there is low content of micronutrients, with the Daily Values of all falling below 10%.[76]\n\n\n\n## Uses[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Cooking apple and Cider apple\n\n![](image)An apple core, part of an apple not usually eaten, containing the seeds\n![](image)Machine for paring, coring, and slicing apples, from Henry B. Scammell's 1897 handbook *Cyclopedia of Valuable Receipts*\nAll parts of the fruit, including the skin, except for the seeds, are suitable for human consumption. The core, from stem to bottom, containing the seeds, is usually not eaten and is discarded.\n\n\nApples can be consumed in various ways: juice, raw in salads, baked in pies, cooked into sauces and spreads like apple butter, and other baked dishes.[77]\n\n\nApples are sometimes used as an ingredient in savory foods, such as sausage and stuffing.[78]\n\n\nSeveral techniques are used to preserve apples and apple products. Apples can be canned, dried or frozen.[77] Canned or frozen apples are eventually baked into pies or other cooked dishes. Apple juice or cider is also bottled. Apple juice is often concentrated and frozen.\n\n\n\n### Culinary[edit]\n\n\nApples are often eaten raw. Cultivars bred for raw consumption are termed dessert or table apples. Apples also figure into many traditional or festival occasions. In the UK, a toffee apple is a traditional confection made by coating an apple in hot toffee and allowing it to cool. Similar treats in the U.S. are candy apples (coated in a hard shell of crystallized sugar syrup) and caramel apples (coated with cooled caramel) and are usually consumed during the autumn season or Halloween. Apples and honey are a ritual food pairing eaten during the Jewish New Year of Rosh Hashanah to symbolize a sweet new year.\n\n\nApples are an important ingredient in many desserts, such as apple pie, apple crumble, apple crisp and apple cake. When cooked, some apple cultivars easily form a puree known as apple sauce. Apples are also made into apple butter and apple jelly. They are often baked or stewed and are also (cooked) in some meat dishes. Dried apples can be eaten or reconstituted (soaked in water, alcohol or some other liquid).\n\n\nApples are milled or pressed to produce apple juice, which may be drunk unfiltered (called apple cider in North America), or filtered. Filtered juice is often concentrated and frozen, then reconstituted later and consumed. Apple juice can be fermented to make cider (called hard cider in North America), ciderkin, and vinegar. Through distillation, various alcoholic beverages can be produced, such as applejack, Calvados, and apfelwein.[79]\n\n\n\n### Organic production[edit]\n\n\nOrganic apples are commonly produced in the United States.[80] Due to infestations by key insects and diseases, organic production is difficult in Europe.[81] The use of pesticides containing chemicals, such as sulfur, copper, microorganisms, viruses, clay powders, or plant extracts (pyrethrum, neem) has been approved by the EU Organic Standing Committee to improve organic yield and quality.[81] A light coating of kaolin, which forms a physical barrier to some pests, also may help prevent apple sun scalding.[60]\n\n\n\n### Phytochemicals[edit]\n\n\nApple skins and seeds contain various phytochemicals, particularly polyphenols which are under preliminary research for their potential health effects.[82]\n\n\n\n### Non-browning apples[edit]\n\n\nThe enzyme polyphenol oxidase causes browning in sliced or bruised apples, by catalyzing the oxidation of phenolic compounds to o-quinones, a browning factor.[83] Browning reduces apple taste, color, and food value. Arctic apples, a non-browning group of apples introduced to the United States market in 2019, have been genetically modified to silence the expression of polyphenol oxidase, thereby delaying a browning effect and improving apple eating quality.[84][85] The US Food and Drug Administration in 2015, and Canadian Food Inspection Agency in 2017, determined that Arctic apples are as safe and nutritious as conventional apples.[86][87]\n\n\n\n### Other products[edit]\n\n\nApple seed oil is obtained by pressing apple seeds for manufacturing cosmetics.[88]\n\n\n\n### Research[edit]\n\n\nPreliminary research is investigating whether apple consumption may affect the risk of some types of cancer.[82][89]\n\n\n\n### Allergy[edit]\n\n\nOne form of apple allergy, often found in northern Europe, is called birch-apple syndrome and is found in people who are also allergic to birch pollen.[90] Allergic reactions are triggered by a protein in apples that is similar to birch pollen, and people affected by this protein can also develop allergies to other fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Reactions, which entail oral allergy syndrome (OAS), generally involve itching and inflammation of the mouth and throat,[90] but in rare cases can also include life-threatening anaphylaxis.[91] This reaction only occurs when raw fruit is consumed\u2014the allergen is neutralized in the cooking process. The variety of apple, maturity and storage conditions can change the amount of allergen present in individual fruits. Long storage times can increase the amount of proteins that cause birch-apple syndrome.[90]\n\n\nIn other areas, such as the Mediterranean, some individuals have adverse reactions to apples because of their similarity to peaches.[90] This form of apple allergy also includes OAS, but often has more severe symptoms, such as vomiting, abdominal pain and urticaria, and can be life-threatening. Individuals with this form of allergy can also develop reactions to other fruits and nuts. Cooking does not break down the protein causing this particular reaction, so affected individuals cannot eat raw or cooked apples. Freshly harvested, over-ripe fruits tend to have the highest levels of the protein that causes this reaction.[90]\n\n\nBreeding efforts have yet to produce a hypoallergenic fruit suitable for either of the two forms of apple allergy.[90]\n\n\n\n### Toxicity of seeds[edit]\n\n\nApple seeds contain small amounts of amygdalin, a sugar and cyanide compound known as a cyanogenic glycoside. Ingesting small amounts of apple seeds causes no ill effects, but consumption of extremely large doses can cause adverse reactions. It may take several hours before the poison takes effect, as cyanogenic glycosides must be hydrolyzed before the cyanide ion is released.[92] The United States National Library of Medicine's Hazardous Substances Data Bank records no cases of amygdalin poisoning from consuming apple seeds.[93]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Apple chip\n* Applecrab, apple\u2013crabapple hybrids for eating\n* Cooking apple\n* Johnny Appleseed\n* List of apple cultivars\n* List of apple dishes\n* Rootstock\n* Welsh apples\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Dickson, Elizabeth E.

Offering insurance services under UnitedHealthcare and healthcare products under Optum, it is the world's eleventh-largest company by revenue and the largest healthcare company by revenue, and the largest insurance company by net premiums. Optum and UnitedHealthcare had roughly equal earnings from operations in 2022.\n\n\nThe company is ranked 10th on the 2023 Fortune Global 500. UnitedHealth Group had a market capitalization of $477.4 billion as of August 7, 2023.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nUnitedHealth Group has origins dating back to late 1974 with the founding of Minnesota-based Charter Med Incorporated by Richard Taylor Burke. It originally processed claims for doctors at the Hennepin County Medical Society.[3] United HealthCare Corporation was founded in 1977 to purchase Charter Med and create a network-based health plan for seniors.[4] It became a publicly traded company in 1984 and changed its name to UnitedHealth Group in 1998.[5]\n\n\nIn 1988, United HealthCare started its first pharmacy benefit management, through its Diversified Pharmaceutical Services subsidiary. It managed pharmacy benefits delivered both through retail pharmacies and mail. The subsidiary was sold to SmithKline Beecham in 1994 for $2.3 billion.[6]\n\n\nIn 1994, United HealthCare acquired Ramsey-HMO, a Florida insurer.[7] In 1995, the company acquired The MetraHealth Companies Inc. for $1.65 billion. MetraHealth was a privately held company formed by combining the group healthcare operations of The Travelers Companies and MetLife. In 1996, United HealthCare acquired HealthWise of America, which operated HMOs in Arkansas, Maryland, Kentucky and Tennessee.[8]\n\n\nIn 1998, the company was reorganized as the holding of independent companies UnitedHealthcare, Ovations, Uniprise, Specialized Care Services and Ingenix, and rebranded as \"UnitedHealth Group\". Also in 1998, United Health Group acquired HealthPartners of Arizona, operator of Arizona's largest AHCCCS provider.[9]\n\n\nIn 2001, EverCare, a UnitedHealth Group subsidiary, merged with LifeMark Health Plans[10] In 2002, UnitedHealth Group acquired GeoAccess and Medicaid insurance company AmeriChoice.[11] In 2003, UnitedHealth Group acquired Mid Atlantic Medical Services, an insurer serving Maryland, Washington D.C., Virginia, Delaware and West Virginia.[12] Also in 2003, UnitedHealth Group acquired Golden Rule Financial, a provider of health savings accounts.[13] On July 21, 2003, Exante Bank started operating in Salt Lake City, Utah, as a Utah state-chartered industrial loan corporation. It changed its name to OptumHealth Bank in 2008[14] and to Optum Bank in 2012.\n\n\nIn April 2004, UnitedHealth Group acquired Touchpoint Health Plan, a Wisconsin health plan.[15] In July 2004, the company acquired Oxford Health Plans.[16]\n\n\nIn December 2005, the company acquired PacifiCare Health Systems.[17] It agreed to divest parts of PacifiCare's commercial health insurance business in Tucson, Arizona and Boulder, Colorado to satisfy antitrust regulator concerns, and also agreed to end its network access agreement with Blue Shield of California. The Tucson business was sold to Cigna.[18] The company acquired Prescription Solutions, another pharmacy benefits manager, as part of its acquisition of PacifiCare Health Systems.[19] This business was later rebranded OptumRx.\n\n\nIn February 2006, the company acquired John Deere Health Care.[20][21][22] The same year, William W. McGuire stepped down as chairman and director due to his involvement in the employee stock options scandal.[23] He was replaced by CEO Stephen Hemsley who had served as president and COO and a member of the board of directors. McGuire's exit compensation from UnitedHealth was anticipated to be $1.1 billion,[24] but he only received $618 million after returning $420 million in stock options.[25]\n\n\nIn February 2008, the company acquired Sierra Health Services for $2.6 billion.[26] As part of the transaction, to obtain regulatory approval, 25,000 customers were sold to Humana.[27] In July 2009, UnitedHealth Group agreed to acquire Health Net's Northeast licensed subsidiaries for up to $570 million in payments spread out over two years.[28] Through 2010 and into 2011, senior executives of the company met monthly with executives of other health insurers to limit the effect of the health care reform law.[29]\n\n\nIn July 2010, Ingenix acquired Picis Clinical Solutions, Inc., a health information provider for the high-acuity areas of hospitals.[30][31]\n\n\n\n![](image)Former LHI buildings in La Crosse\nIn 2011, Logistics Health, Inc. of La Crosse, Wisconsin, was acquired by OptumHealth.[32] In September 2014, the office buildings where LHI is based were sold to UnitedHealth Group for $45 million.[33][34]\n\n\nIn February 2012, the company acquired XLHealth, a sponsor of Medicare Advantage health plans with a primary focus on medicare recipients with special needs such as those with chronic illness and those eligible for Medicaid (\"dual eligibles\").[35] In October 2012, UnitedHealth Group and Amil Participa\u00e7\u00f5es, one of the biggest Brazilian health insurance companies, completed the first phase of their merger.[36][37][38]\n\n\nIn February 2014, Optum secured a majority stake in the Washington, D.C.-based startup Audax Health.[39] Audax's CEO, Grant Verstandig, continued running the firm alongside COO David Ko.[39] In October 2014, Optum Health acquired the health services unit of Alere for $600 million cash.[40]\n\n\nIn March 2015, it was announced that CatamaranRx would be acquired by OptumRx.[41]\n\n\nIn April 2016, the company announced it was pulling out of all but a \"handful\" of state healthcare exchanges provided under Affordable Care Act and will continue to sell only in three states in 2017.[42][43]\n\n\nIn 2017, UnitedHealth's Optum unit acquired Rally Health,[44] a company started by Audax Health's executives.[45] Prior to acquisition, in 2015, UnitedHealth supported Rally Health as a majority investor,[46] and through enrolling 5 million UnitedHealth policy holders in Rally Health's flagship product, RallySM.[45][47][nt 1] The close relations between UnitedHealth, Audax Health and Rally Health follows a close personal relationship between Grant Vrestandig (Audax and Rally) and UnitedHealth's President and CFO at the time, David Wichmann.[48]\n\n\nIn June 2019, UnitedHealth's Optum division acquired Davita Medical Group from DaVita Inc. for $4.3 billion.[49][50][51] That year, the company also agreed to acquire Equian for $3.2 billion.[52][53][54][55] On June 19, 2019, UnitedHealth acquired the online patient community platform PatientsLikeMe for an undisclosed amount and it will be incorporated into UnitedHealth Group's research division.[56]\n\n\nIn November 2019, Andrew Witty was named president of UnitedHealth, in addition to his role as chief executive of the company's Optum division.[57]\n\n\nUnitedHealth announced in March 2022 that it would acquire LHC Group for $5.4 billion. The deal will expand its home health capabilities by combining LHC's services with UnitedHealth's Optum unit.[58]\n\n\nIn 2022, UnitedHealth Group said there would be no out-of-pocket costs for albuterol, epinephrine, glucagon, insulin, and naloxone for fully insured members starting in 2023. The discounts were guaranteed for less than a quarter of UnitedHealthcare's membership.[59]\n\n\n\n## Organizational structure[edit]\n\n\nUnitedHealth Group has two subsidiaries: Optum and UnitedHealthcare.\n\n\n\n### Optum[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Optum\n\nFormed in 2011, Optum says that it provides \"data and analytics, pharmacy care services, population health, healthcare delivery and healthcare operations\".[60]\n\n\nIt is organized into three businesses:\n\n\n\n* OptumHealth \u2013 provides primary and secondary care.[60][61]\n* OptumInsight \u2013 provides data analytics, technology, and operations services.[60]\n* OptumRX \u2013 provides pharmacy services and also.[60]\n\n\n### UnitedHealthcare[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Logo for UnitedHealthcare\n**UnitedHealthcare** is an insurance and managed care company with four main divisions:\n\n\n\n* UnitedHealthcare Employer and Individual \u2013 provides health benefit plans and services for large national employers.\n* UnitedHealthcare Medicare and Retirement \u2013 provides health and well-being services to individuals age 65 and older.[62]\n* UnitedHealthcare Community and State \u2013 serves state programs that care for the economically disadvantaged, the medically underserved, and people without the benefit of employer-funded health care coverage, in exchange for a monthly premium per member from the state program.[62]\n* UnitedHealthcare Global \u2013 serves 6.2 million people with medical benefits, residing principally in Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Peru but also in more than 130 other countries.[62]\n\n\n## Products and services[edit]\n\n\n### Health insurance plans[edit]\n\n\nUnitedHealthcare offers commercial group insurance plans across the United States under several product names with different offerings.[63]\n\n\n\n* **UnitedHealthcare Select** is an exclusive provider organization (EPO) with no coverage for out-of-network providers[64]\n* **UnitedHealthcare Select Plus** is a preferred provider organization (PPO).[64]\n* **UnitedHealthcare Choice** functions as a HMO plan with access to specialists,[64] whereas UnitedHealthcare Choice Plus is a plan which allows for out-of-network coverage.[64]\n* **UnitedHealthcare Navigate, Charter, and Compass** require a primary care physician referral to see a specialist[63] meaning that they are more restrictive managed care plans, similar to point of service plans.\n\n\n#### Provider networks[edit]\n\n\nUnitedHealthcare negotiates with providers in periodic contract negotiation; contracts may be discontinued from time to time.[63] High-profile contract disputes can span provider networks across the nation, as in the case of a 2018 dispute with a major emergency room doctor group, Envision Healthcare.[65]\n\n\n\n#### Provider directory[edit]\n\n\nMaintaining up-to-date provider directories is necessary since the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services can fine insurers with outdated directories.[66] As a condition of participation, UnitedHealthcare requires that providers notify them of changes, but also has a Professional Verification Outreach program to proactively request information from providers.[63] However, providers are burdened by having to maintain their information with multiple networks (e.g., competitors to UnitedHealthcare). The total cost of maintaining these directories is estimated at $2.1b annually, and a blockchain initiative began in 2018 to share the directory.[66]\n\n\n\n## Finance[edit]\n\n\nFor the fiscal year 2022, UnitedHealth Group reported earnings of US$20.64 billion, with an annual revenue of US$324.16 billion.[67]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Revenuein million US$\n | Net incomein million US$\n | Total assetsin million US$\n | Price per sharein US$\n | Employees\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2005[68] | 46,425\n | 3,083\n | 41,288\n | 45.24\n |  |\n| 2006[69] | 71,542\n | 4,159\n | 48,320\n | 44.83\n |  |\n| 2007[70] | 75,431\n | 4,654\n | 50,899\n | 45.91\n |  |\n| 2008[71] | 81,186\n | 2,977\n | 55,815\n | 28.40\n |  |\n| 2009[72] | 87,138\n | 3,822\n | 59,045\n | 23.10\n | 80,000\n |\n| 2010[73] | 94,155\n | 4,634\n | 63,063\n | 29.20\n | 87,000\n |\n| 2011[74] | 101,862\n | 5,142\n | 67,889\n | 41.68\n | 99,000\n |\n| 2012[75] | 110,618\n | 5,526\n | 80,885\n | 50.04\n | 133,000\n |\n| 2013[76] | 122,489\n | 5,625\n | 81,882\n | 60.29\n | 156,000\n |\n| 2014[77] | 130,474\n | 5,619\n | 86,382\n | 78.28\n | 170,000\n |\n| 2015[78] | 157,107\n | 5,813\n | 111,254\n | 111.06\n | 200,000\n |\n| 2016[79] | 184,840\n | 7,017\n | 122,810\n | 131.31\n | 230,000\n |\n| 2017[80] | 201,159\n | 10,558\n | 139,058\n | 183.48\n | 260,000\n |\n| 2018[81] | 226,247\n | 11,986\n | 152,221\n | 245.88\n | 300,000\n |\n| 2019[82] | 242,155\n | 13,839\n | 173,889\n | 249.59\n | 325,000\n |\n| 2020[82] | 257,141\n | 15,403\n | 197,289\n | 301.28\n | 330,000\n |\n| 2021[82] | 287,597\n | 17,285\n | 212,206\n | 403.71\n | 350,000\n |\n| 2022[82] | 324,162\n | 20,639\n | 245,705\n |  | 400,000\n |\n\n\n## Criticism and controversies[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**.

UnitedHealth Group subsequently spent $2.75 million to $4.86 million from 2011 to 2021 and the company went on to pull in $78,692 million in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2021 alone.[83]\n\n\nThe UnitedHealth Group hired seven different lobbying firms to work on its behalf in 2010.[84] In addition, its corporate political action committee or PAC, called **United for Health,** spent an additional $1 million on lobbying activities in 2010.[85]\n\n\nQSSI, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, is one of the 55 contractors hired by the United States Department of Health and Human Services to work on the HealthCare.gov web site.[86]\n\n\n\n### Legal issues[edit]\n\n\nIn 2006, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began investigating the conduct of UnitedHealth Group's management and directors, for backdating of stock options. Investigations were also begun by the Internal Revenue Service and prosecutors in the U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of New York, who subpoenaed documents from the company. The investigations came to light after a series of probing stories in the *Wall Street Journal* in May 2006, discussing apparent backdating of hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of stock options by UHC management. The backdating apparently occurred with the knowledge and approval of the directors, according to the *Journal*. Major shareholders have filed lawsuits accusing former New Jersey governor Thomas Kean and UHC's other directors of failing in their fiduciary duty.[87] On October 15, 2006, CEO William W. McGuire was forced to resign, and relinquish hundreds of millions of dollars in stock options. On December 6, 2007, the SEC announced a settlement under which McGuire will repay $468 million, as a partial settlement of the backdating prosecution.[88][89][90]\n\n\nOn December 6, 2007, the SEC announced a settlement under which McGuire was to repay $468 million, including a $7 million civil penalty, as a partial settlement of the backdating prosecution. He was also barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for ten years.[91][92][93] This was the first time in which the little-used \"clawback\" provision under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was used against an individual by the SEC. The SEC continued its investigations even after it in 2008 settled legal actions against both UnitedHealth Group itself and its former general counsel.[94]\n\n\nIn June 2006, the American Chiropractic Association filed a national class-action lawsuit against the American Chiropractic Network (ACN), which is owned by UnitedHealth Group and administers chiropractic benefits, and against UnitedHealth Group itself, for alleged practices in violation of the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).[95]\n\n\n\n#### OptumInsight, aka Ingenix[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2008, New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo announced an industry-wide investigation into a scheme by health insurers to defraud consumers by manipulating reasonable and customary rates. The announcement included a statement that Cuomo intended \"to file suit against Ingenix, Inc., its parent UnitedHealth Group, and three additional subsidiaries.\" Cuomo asserted that his investigation found that rates found in a database of health care charges maintained by Ingenix were lower than what he determined was the actual cost of certain medical expenses. Cuomo said this inappropriately allowed health insurance companies to deny a portion of provider claims, thereby pushing costs down to members.[96]\n\n\nOn January 13, 2009, Ingenix announced an agreement with the New York State attorney settling the probe into the independence of the health pricing database. Under the settlement, UnitedHealth Group and Ingenix would pay $50 million to finance a new, non-profit entity that would develop a new health care pricing database. Ingenix would discontinue its medical pricing databases when the new entity makes its product available. The company acknowledged the appearance of a conflict of interest but admitted no wrongdoing.[97]\n\n\nOn January 15, 2009, UnitedHealth Group announced a $350 million settlement of three class action lawsuits filed in Federal court by the American Medical Association, UnitedHealth Group members, healthcare providers, and state medical societies for not paying out-of-network benefits. This settlement came two days after a similar settlement with Cuomo.[98]\n\n\nOn October 27, 2009, Cuomo announced the creation of FAIR Health, the independent, non-profit organization that will develop a nationwide database for consumer reimbursement, as well as a website where consumers will be able to compare prices before they choose doctors. To fund FAIR Health, the Attorney General's office secured nearly $100 million from insurers such as Aetna, UnitedHealth Group, and Anthem Inc.[99]\n\n\n\n#### Investigations and lawsuits[edit]\n\n\n#### Medicare overbilling lawsuit[edit]\n\n\nA whistleblower lawsuit, filed in 2011, charges UnitedHealth Group's data analytics division with assisting in defrauding Medicare by boosting risk adjustment scores from Medicare Advantage companies. The suit alleges that UnitedHealth Group subsidiary Ingenix (now OptumInsight) \"defrauded the United States of hundreds of millions \u2014 and likely billions \u2014 of dollars.\" Former UnitedHealth executive Benjamin Poehling brought the suit under the False Claims Act. The government said it would proceed on claims against two health care companies, UnitedHealth and its Texas subsidiary WellMed Medical Management. In February 2017, a federal judge unsealed the suit after the Department of Justice announced it would join the case.[100][101]\n\n\n\n#### *Richard Cole, and others v. United Healthcare*[edit]\n\n\nOn April 29, 2019, Judge Robert N. Scola Jr. of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, a cancer survivor, recused himself from a case against United Healthcare, stating that the company's denial of treatment was \"immoral and barbaric\", and that his opinions regarding the company would prevent him from \"deciding this case fairly and impartially.\"[102][103]\n\n\n\n#### PacifiCare fine in California[edit]\n\n\nIn 2008, the California Department of Insurance took action against UnitedHealthcare's subsidiary PacifiCare Health Systems, acquired in 2005, ultimately fining UnitedHealthcare around $173 million for an estimated over 900,000 violations of the Unfair Insurance Practices Act; by 2019, the case was still being disputed in court, with the possibility of affirming $91 million in penalties.[104]\n\n\n\n#### CMS fine over Medicare Part D[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, CMS fined UnitedHealthcare after discovering issues in Medicare Part D leading to delays or denials in a 2016 audit.[105]\n\n\n\n#### New Jersey fine in 2018[edit]\n\n\nThe New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance fined UnitedHealthcare $2.5 million due to various compliance issues; this was the largest fine against a licensee in nine years.[106]\n\n\n\n#### Pennsylvania[edit]\n\n\nUnitedHealthcare assessed $1 million penalty for claims payment violations.[107]\n\n\n\n#### Northern California[edit]\n\n\nUnited Behavioral Health sued over $5 million in denied claims.[108]\n\n\n\n#### Policy Research ownership[edit]\n\n\nThe Lewin Group is a policy research and consulting firm that provides an economic analysis of health care and human services issues and policies.[109]\nThe organization has existed for about 40 years and has maintained a nonpartisan reputation through its many ownership changes that have occurred over that time.[109]\nThe Lewin Group was purchased in 2007 by Ingenix, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, but alleges editorial and analytical \"independence\" from UnitedHealth Group, its parent company.[109]\nThe Lewin Group discloses its ownership in its reports and on its website. While the Lewin Group does not advocate for or against any legislation, both Democratic and Republican politicians frequently cite the firm's studies to argue for and against various U.S. healthcare reform proposals.[110] For example, Democratic Senator Ron Wyden uses Lewin Group estimates to cite the feasibility of his Healthy Americans Act.[111] Former U.S. Representative Eric Cantor, the former House Republican Whip, has referred to the organization as \"the nonpartisan Lewin Group\" in arguing against government-funded health insurance proposals.\n\n\nSeveral Lewin studies have been used to argue both for and against the inclusion of a public option in national health reform. Lewin clients who often cite its findings include The Commonwealth Fund which recently held up a Lewin study it commissioned to advocate for a public plan. The report showed that legislative proposals would achieve nearly universal coverage and \"estimated that a public plan could offer small businesses insurance that is at least 9 percent cheaper than current small-business policies.\"[112]\n\n\nHowever, The Lewin Group has acknowledged that clients sometimes choose not to publicize the results of studies they have commissioned. Indeed, Lewin Group Vice President John Sheils told *The Washington Post* that \"sometimes studies come out that don't show exactly what the client wants to see. And in those instances, they have [the] option to bury the study.\"[113]\n\n\n\n#### Influencing the research of Yale University economist Zack Cooper[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2021, a report from *The Intercept* revealed that UnitedHealthcare worked behind the scenes to guide Yale University healthcare economist Zack Cooper's research on surprise medical billing.[114] United provided Cooper with anonymous data and made edits to his paper, which blamed physician networks TeamHealth and EmCare for the rise in balance billing. United Health Network CEO Dan Rosenthal later confirmed United's work with Cooper during a deposition in a lawsuit filed against United by TeamHealth.[115] Cooper's work was presented as independent, unbiased academic research before Congress, the White House, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, and numerous media reports.[116]\n\n\n\n#### Underpaying physicians[edit]\n\n\nIn late 2021, Tennessee-based physician network TeamHealth sued UnitedHealthcare in the 8th District Court of Clark County, Nevada, alleging the insurer underpaid claims to three of TeamHealth's Nevada-based affiliates. In November 2021, the jury unanimously found United guilty of \"oppression, fraud, and malice\" in its conduct and awarded TeamHealth $2.65 million in compensatory damages.[117] In December, the jury reconvened to determine punitive damages and awarded TeamHealth $60 million.[118] TeamHealth plans to pursue similar legal action against United and other insurers in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, Florida, Oklahoma, and Texas.[119]\n\n\n\n#### Change Healthcare[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2022, the United States Department of Justice sued to stop UnitedHealth Group's $8 billion acquisition of Change Healthcare, arguing that the deal would give UnitedHealth access to its competitors' data and ultimately push up healthcare cost. The Justice Department said that UnitedHealth knew that access to claims would give it a view into rival health plans at Humana, Anthem Inc, CVS Health, Aetna, and Cigna.[120] A U.S. judge rejected the department's bid in September. Following completion of the acquisition in October 2022, the parties agreed that the appeal would be voluntarily dismissed, with the Justice Department not providing reasons for dropping the appeal.[121]\n\n\n\n#### Medicare Advantage Overbilling[edit]\n\n\nThe New York Times report in October 2021 identified UnitedHealth in a list of Medicare insurers accused of over-billing. UnitedHealth has been accused by a whistle blower, accused of fraud by the U.S. government and over-billed according to the Inspector General. Executives at UnitedHealth Group told workers to mine old medical records for more illnesses, to identify diagnoses of serious diseases that might have never existed, inflating bills paid by the federal government's Medicare Advantage program.[122]\n\n\nA study by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that in 2021, Medicare Advantage programs provided insurers with double the gross margin than insurance for individuals, groups, or Medicaid Managed Care.[123][124]\n\n\n\n## Foundations[edit]\n\n\nFoundations affiliated with UnitedHealth Group include the United Health Foundation (UHF) and the UnitedHealthcare Children's Foundation (UHCCF), both of which were established in 1999.[125]\n\n\nUHF pledged $100 million over ten years to fund scholarships and workforce development programs focused on increasing ethnic and racial diversity within the health care industry.[126]\n\n\nUHCCF administers grants to help pay for medical costs for families with coverage gaps. According to UHCCF, the foundation raises money for medical grants by selling gift items such as backpacks, books, cards, and games, some of which are created by children.[127]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* America's Health Rankings (reports released annually in conjunction with UnitedHealth Group's United Health Foundation since 1990)\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Also referred to as Rally.(Staff (February 3, 2015). \"Rally Health Launches Digital Wellness Platform With Over 5M People\". *HIT Consultant*.
