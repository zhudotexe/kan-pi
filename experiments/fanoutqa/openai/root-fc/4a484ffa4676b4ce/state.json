coaches of the Flyers.

After interim coach Craig Ramsay led the Flyers to the Eastern Conference Finals, the Flyers named Ramsay head coach.[35] The games Ramsay coached in place of Neilson are officially counted on Neilson's coaching totals.[36]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n**General**\n\n\n\n* \"Philadelphia Flyers Coach Register\". *Hockey-Reference.com*.

The Devils had 17 different head coaches since the team moved to New Jersey in the 1982\u201383, with Jacques Lemaire serving as coach three times and Tom McVie, Larry Robinson, and Lou Lamoriello each serving twice. \n\n\nThree coaches have led the team to a victory in the Stanley Cup Finals: Lemaire in 1995, Robinson in 2000, and Pat Burns in 2003. Lemaire is the all-time leader in games coached and wins, while Burns leads in winning percentage (with at least one full season coached). \n\n\nSeveral former players have worked for the Devils as assistant coaches, including John MacLean and Bobby Carpenter, the only men whose names are inscribed on the Stanley Cup as both a player and a coach with New Jersey. MacLean later served as head coach and is the only former Devils' player to serve in that capacity.\n\n\nOn December 26, 2014, after the firing of DeBoer, head coaching responsibilities were split between Adam Oates and Scott Stevens for the remainder of the 2014\u201315 season, with Lamoriello supervising the team from the bench.[1][2]\n\n\n\n\n## Key[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **#** | Number of coaches\n |\n| **GC** | Games coached\n |\n| **W** | Wins\n |\n| **L** | Losses\n |\n| **T** | Ties (no longer applicable after the 2005\u201306 season)\n |\n| **OTL** | Overtime losses (includes shootout losses after 2005\u201306)\n |\n| **Pts** | Points\n |\n| **Win%** | Winning percentage |\n| \u00a7\n | Name is engraved on the Stanley Cup |\n\n\n## Coaches[edit]\n\n\n*Note: This list does not include data from the Kansas City Scouts and the Colorado Rockies.

The franchise was founded in 1924 and entered the NHL as the first American-based expansion team, playing its initial seasons at the still-active Boston Arena.[2][3] It is an Original Six team, along with the Toronto Maple Leafs, Detroit Red Wings, New York Rangers, Montreal Canadiens and Chicago Blackhawks.[1] Its home arena is the 17,565-person capacity TD Garden, where it has played since 1995, after leaving the Boston Garden.[1]\n\n\nArt Ross served three terms as the Bruins head coach.[4] Ross, Lynn Patrick, and Milt Schmidt have all been inducted to the Hockey Hall of Fame. Harry Sinden, Gerry Cheevers, Tom Johnson and Frank Patrick are Hockey Hall of Fame inductees, and spent their entire coaching careers with the Bruins. Cooney Weiland, Dit Clapper, Terry O'Reilly, Steve Kasper and Mike O'Connell also coached only for the Bruins,[5][6][7][8][9] with Mike Sullivan taking over as head coach for the Pittsburgh Penguins on December 12, 2015.[10]\n\n\nStatistically, Tom Johnson was the most successful head coach, with a winning percentage of .738.[11] He is followed by Harry Sinden, who, averaging his two terms, had a winning percentage of .689.[12] The worst head coach statistically was Phil Watson, who, with a winning percentage of .268, only won 16 out of the 84 games he coached.[13] Claude Julien took over after Dave Lewis was dismissed in 2007.[14][15] Bruce Cassidy succeeded Julien on February 7, 2017, and served as head coach until his firing on June 6, 2022.[16]\n\n\n\n\n## Key[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |

The team is a member of the Atlantic Division in the Eastern Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL) and is one of the Original Six teams of the NHL. There have been 39 head coaches in their franchise history; one during the era of the Toronto Arenas (1917\u20131919), seven during the era of the Toronto St. Patricks (1919\u20131927) and the rest under the Toronto Maple Leafs (1927\u2013present).[1] Five Maple Leafs coaches have been inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame as players: Dick Irvin, Joe Primeau, King Clancy, Red Kelly, and Dick Duff[2] while five others have been inducted as builders: Conn Smythe, Hap Day, Punch Imlach, Roger Neilson, and Pat Quinn.[3]\n\n\nFrank Carroll (brother of the team's first NHL coach, Dick Carroll) has the highest winning percentage of any Maple Leafs coach, with a .625 record from the 24 games he coached in his single 1920\u201321 season. Neither Mike Rodden nor interim coach Dick Duff, who coached only two games each in 1927 and 1980 respectively, won a game with the team. Dan Maloney has the worst record of any who coached more than a season, with a .328 winning percentage from 160 games. Punch Imlach coached the most games of any Maple Leafs coach with 750 games from 1959 to 1969.[1] Pat Burns is the franchise's only coach to win the Jack Adams Award awarded to the head coach \"adjudged to have contributed the most to his team's success.\" Pat Quinn also won the award, but with two teams prior to coaching the Maple Leafs.[4]\n\n\nThe current head coach is Sheldon Keefe, who became the 40th head coach in franchise history on November 20, 2019.[5]\n\n\nSheldon Keefe is the only living person who has coached the Toronto Maple Leafs to a playoff series win.

They play in the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference in the National Hockey League (NHL). Often referred to as the Bolts,[1] the team joined the NHL in 1992 as an expansion team, and have won the Stanley Cup championship in 2004, 2020 and 2021.[2] Having first played in the Expo Hall,[3] and later in the ThunderDome (now known as Tropicana Field),[4] the Lightning have played their home games at the Ice Palace, currently titled Amalie Arena, since 1996. The Lightning are owned by Jeffrey Vinik, Julien BriseBois is their general manager, and Steven Stamkos is the team captain.\n\n\nThere have been nine\u00a0head coaches for the Lightning franchise. The team's first head coach was Terry Crisp, who coached for five seasons. John Tortorella, the only American to head coach the team, was the first Lightning coach to have won the Prince of Wales Trophy,[5] the Stanley Cup,[2] and to have been awarded the Jack Adams Award, all of which happened in the 2003\u201304 season. Steve Ludzik and Jon Cooper are the only two head coaches who have spent their entire NHL head coaching careers with the Lightning.\n\n\nJon Cooper is the team's current head coach, having been named to the position on March 25, 2013.[6] Cooper is the only head coach of the Lightning to win the Prince of Wales Trophy four times.[7] Under Cooper, the franchise won its second Stanley Cup championship in 2020 and third championship in 2021. Cooper is the franchise's all-time leader for the most regular season wins (480), playoff games coached (139), and the most playoff-games won (84).\n\n\n\n\n## Key[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **#** | Number of coaches[a] |\n| **GC** | Games coached\n |\n| **W** | Wins = 2 points\n |\n| **L** | Losses = 0 points\n |\n| **T** | Ties = 1 point\n |\n| **OT** | Overtime/shootout losses = 1 point[b] |\n| **PTS** | Points |\n| **Win%** | Winning percentage |\n| \\*\n | Spent entire NHL head coaching career with the Lightning\n |\n\n\n## Coaches[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jon Cooper has been head coach since 2013\n*Note: Statistics are correct through the end of the 2022\u201323 NHL regular season.*\n\n\n\n\n\nHead coaches of the Tampa Bay Lightning\n| #\n | Name\n | Term[c] | Regular season\n | Playoffs\n | Achievements\n | Reference\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GC\n | W\n | L\n | T/OT\n | PTS\n | PTS%\n | GC\n | W\n | L\n | Win%\n |\n| **1** | Terry Crisp | 1992\u20131998 | 391\n | 142\n | 204\n | 45\n | 329\n | .421\n | 6\n | 2\n | 4\n | .333\n |  | [8] |\n| **2** | Rick Paterson\\*\n | 1998 | 6\n | 0\n | 6\n | 0\n | 0\n | .000\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n |  | [9] |\n| **3** | Jacques Demers | 1998\u20131999 | 147\n | 34\n | 96\n | 17\n | 85\n | .289\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n |  | [10] |\n| **4** | Steve Ludzik\\*\n | 1999\u20132001 | 121\n | 31\n | 67\n | 23\n | 85\n | .351\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n |  | [11] |\n| **5** | John Tortorella | 2001\u20132008 | 535\n | 239\n | 222\n | 74\n | 552\n | .516\n | 45\n | 24\n | 21\n | .533\n | Stanley Cup championship: 2004[2]Jack Adams Award winner: 2003\u201304[12]Prince of Wales Trophy winner: 2004 [5] | [13] |\n| **6** | Barry Melrose | 2008 | 16\n | 5\n | 7\n | 4\n | 14\n | .438\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n |  | [14] |\n| **7** | Rick Tocchet | 2008\u20132010 | 148\n | 53\n | 69\n | 26\n | 132\n | .446\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n |  | [15] |\n| **8** | Guy Boucher | 2010\u20132013 | 196\n | 97\n | 79\n | 20\n | 214\n | .546\n | 18\n | 11\n | 7\n | .611\n |  | [16] |\n| **9** | Jon Cooper\\*\n | 2013\u2013*present* | 797\n | 480\n | 250\n | 67\n | 1,027\n | .644\n | 145\n | 86\n | 59\n | .593\n | NHL All-Star Game: 2018, 2019[17][18]Presidents' Trophy winner: 2018\u201319[19]Stanley Cup championship: 2020, 2021Prince of Wales Trophy winner: 2015, 2020, 2021, 2022[20] | [21] |\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n* **a** A running total of the number of coaches of the Lightning.

They play in the Metropolitan Division of the Eastern Conference in the National Hockey League (NHL). The franchise was established as one of six new franchises of the 1967 NHL expansion.[1] Since their foundation, the Penguins had played their home games at the Civic Arena, which was replaced by the Consol Energy Center in 2010.[2] The franchise is co-owned by Ronald Burkle and Mario Lemieux\u2014the only player/owner in the NHL's modern era.[3] According to Forbes, the Penguins were the 11th most valuable NHL franchise, at US$222\u00a0million, in 2009.[4]\n\n\nThere have been 22\u00a0head coaches for the Penguins franchise.[5] The franchise's first head coach was Red Sullivan, former New York Rangers captain and coach.[6] Sullivan was replaced by future Hockey Hall of Fame inductee Red Kelly, after two seasons. Kelly was inducted into the Hall of Fame as a player,[7] and head coaches Craig Patrick, Bob Johnson, Scotty Bowman, and Herb Brooks were inducted as builders.[8] Eddie Johnston\u2014who along with Patrick and Ken Schinkel served two tenures as head coach\u2014leads Penguins' coaches in games coached. Bob Johnson led the Penguins to their first Stanley Cup victory in 1991, but was forced to retire due to health problems after the season\u2014he died later that year.[9] Bowman succeeded Johnson and coached the team to its second Stanley Cup victory the following season. Michel Therrien won the Prince of Wales Trophy, as Eastern Conference champion, during the 2007\u201308 season.[10] Therrien was replaced the following season by Dan Bylsma.[11] Bylsma would lead the Penguins to their third Stanley Cup championship that same season. Bylsma was fired after the 2013-14 season and replaced by Mike Johnston.[12] Johnston was fired during the 2015-16 season and replaced by Michael (Mike) Barry Sullivan.[13] Sullivan led the Penguins to their fourth Stanley Cup victory that season and also their fifth Stanley cup victory in the following season in 2016-17\n\n\n\n## Key[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Scotty Bowman was the Penguins' head coach from 1991 to 1993\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **#** | Number of coaches\n |\n| **Term** | Years spent as coach\n |\n| **Games** | Games coached\n |\n| **W** | Wins\n |\n| **L** | Losses\n |\n| **T** | Ties\n |\n| **OTL** | Overtime/shootout losses[a] |\n| **Win%** | Winning percentage |\n| **PG** | Playoff games coached\n |\n| **PW** | Playoff wins\n |\n| **PL** | Playoff losses\n |\n| **PWin%** | Playoff winning percentage\n |\n| \\*\n | Spent entire NHL head coaching career with the Penguins\n |\n| **\\*** or **\u2020** | Elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame (\u2020 denotes induction as a builder, \\* denotes induction as a player)\n |\n\n\n## Coaches[edit]\n\n\n*Note: Statistics are updated through the completion of the 2021\u201322 season.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| # | Name[b] | Term[c] | Games | W | L | T | OTL | Win% | PG | PW | PL | PWin% | Achievements | Ref\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | George \"Red\" Sullivan | 1967\u20131969 | 150 | 47 | 79 | 24 | \u2014 | .393 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |  | [14] |\n| 2 | Red Kelly\\* | 1969\u20131973 | 274 | 90 | 132 | 52 | \u2014 | .423 | 14 | 6 | 8 | .429 |  | [15] |\n| 3 | Ken Schinkel | 1973\u20131974,1976\u20131977 | 203 | 83 | 92 | 28 | \u2014 | .478 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |  | [16] |\n| 4 | Marc Boileau | 1974\u20131976 | 151 | 66 | 61 | 24 | \u2014 | .517 | 9 | 5 | 4 | .555 |  | [17] |\n| 5 | Johnny Wilson | 1977\u20131980 | 240 | 91 | 105 | 44 | \u2014 | .471 | 12 | 4 | 8 | .333 |  | [18] |\n| 6 | Eddie Johnston | 1980\u20131983,1993\u20131997 | 516 | 232 | 224 | 60 | \u2014 | .508 | 46 | 22 | 24 | .478 |  | [19] |\n| 7 | Lou Angotti | 1983\u20131984 | 80 | 16 | 58 | 6 | \u2014 | .232 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |  | [20] |\n| 8 | Bob Berry | 1984\u20131987 | 240 | 88 | 127 | 25 | \u2014 | .419 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |  | [21] |\n| 9 | Pierre Creamer | 1987\u20131988 | 80 | 36 | 35 | 9 | \u2014 | .506 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |  | [22] |\n| 10 | Gene Ubriaco | 1988\u20131989 | 106 | 50 | 47 | 9 | \u2014 | .514 | 11 | 7 | 4 | .636 |  | [23] |\n| 11 | Craig Patrick\u2020 | 1989\u20131990,[d]1997[e] | 74 | 29 | 36 | 9 | \u2014 | .453 | 5 | 1 | 4 | .200 |  | [24] |\n| 12 | Bob Johnson\u2020 | 1990\u20131991 | 80 | 41 | 33 | 6 | \u2014 | .550 | 24 | 16 | 8 | .667 | Stanley Cup champions (1991) | [25] |\n| 13 | Scotty Bowman | 1991\u20131993 | 164 | 95 | 53 | 16 | \u2014 | .628 | 33 | 23 | 10 | .696 | Presidents' Trophy (1993)Stanley Cup champions (1992) | [26] |\n| 14 | Kevin Constantine | 1997\u20131999 | 189 | 86 | 67 | 35 | 4 | .511 | 19 | 8 | 11 | .421 |  | [27] |\n| 15 | Herb Brooks\u2020 | 1999\u20132000 | 57 | 29 | 24 | 5 | 2 | .570 | 11 | 6 | 5 | .545 |  | [28] |\n| 16 | Ivan Hlinka\u2020 | 2000\u20132001 | 86 | 42 | 32 | 9 | 3 | .558 | 18 | 9 | 9 | .500 |  | [29] |\n| 17 | Rick Kehoe | 2001\u20132003 | 160 | 55 | 81 | 14 | 10 | .419 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |  | [30] |\n| 18 | Ed Olczyk | 2003\u20132005 | 113 | 31 | 64 | 14 | 4 | .274 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |  | [31] |\n| 19 | Michel Therrien | 2005\u20132009[f] | 272 | 135 | 105 | \u2014 | 32 | .502 | 25 | 15 | 10 | .600 | Prince of Wales Trophy (2008) | [32] |\n| 20 | Dan Bylsma | 2009\u20132014 | 401 | 252 | 117 | \u2014 | 32 | .670 | 78 | 43 | 35 | .551 | Stanley Cup champions (2009)Jack Adams Award (2011) | [33][34] |\n| 21 | Mike Johnston | 2014\u20132015[g] | 110 | 58 | 37 | \u2014 | 15 | .595 | 5 | 1 | 4 | .200 |  | [35][36] |\n| 22 | Mike Sullivan | 2015\u2013present | 405 | 237 | 126 | \u2014 | 42 | .639 | 82 | 44 | 38 | .537 | Stanley Cup champions (2016, 2017) | [37][36] |\n\n\n## Notes and references[edit]\n\n\n* **a** Beginning with the 2005\u201306 season, the NHL instituted a shootout for regular season games that remained tied after a five-minute overtime period, which prevented ties.[38]\n* **b** Head coaches with multiple terms are counted once; figures are career totals.
