In both innings, the Rangers were one strike away from their first World Series championship. The Cardinals won the game in the 11th inning on a walk-off home run by David Freese, who was named World Series MVP. The Series was also known for the blowout Game\u00a03, in which Cardinals player Albert Pujols hit three home runs, a World Series feat previously accomplished only by Reggie Jackson and Babe Ruth, and subsequently by Pablo Sandoval in 2012. In 2020, ESPN named the 2011 World Series the fifth greatest of all-time.[4]\n\n\nThe Series began on October 19, earlier than the previous season, so that no games would be played in November.[5] The Cardinals enjoyed home-field advantage for the series because the NL won the 2011 All-Star Game 5\u20131 on July 12.[6] The 2011 World Series was the first World Series to go all seven games since the 2002 Series.\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2011 MLB Postseason\n\nThe Rangers were appearing in their second consecutive World Series; they lost the 2010 Series to the San Francisco Giants in five games. They were the first American League team to play in consecutive World Series since the New York Yankees did it from 1998 to 2001.[7] They earned their postseason berth by winning the American League West division, then defeated the Tampa Bay Rays in the American League Division Series and the Detroit Tigers in the American League Championship Series to earn their World Series berth.\n\n\nThe Cardinals were appearing in their 18th World Series, and third in eight years.[8] They lost to the Boston Red Sox in 2004, but won in 2006 against the Detroit Tigers. The Cardinals earned their postseason berth by winning the National League Wild Card on the last day of the regular season, then defeated the Philadelphia Phillies in the National League Division Series and the Milwaukee Brewers in the National League Championship Series to earn their World Series berth.\n\n\nThis Series was only the second time the Rangers and the Cardinals played each other; they met in regular-season interleague play in 2004, when the Cardinals won two of a three-game series in Texas.[9] This was the first World Series assignment for umpires Greg Gibson and Ron Kulpa. Each of the other umpires had previously worked one World Series.[10]\n\n\nThe Cardinals were supported by fans brandishing Rally Squirrel memorabilia that alluded to a squirrel that ran across the field during a playoff game.\n\n\nNational anthem singers featured\nGame one: Scotty McCreery,\nGame two: Trace Adkins,\nGame three: Ronnie Dunn,\nGame four: Zooey Deschanel,\nGame five: Demi Lovato,\nGame six: Joe, and\nGame seven: Chris Daughtry (from Daughtry)\n\n\n\n![](image)Rangers newcomer Adri\u00e1n Beltr\u00e9 won both a Gold Glove and Silver Slugger award for his efforts during the regular season.\n### Texas Rangers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2011 Texas Rangers season\n\nThis was the Rangers' second appearance in the World Series. Heading into 2010, their 50th season as a franchise (counting its time as the **Washington Senators**), the team was the only one in Major League Baseball never to win a postseason series,[9] and was among three teams (along with the Seattle Mariners and the Washington Nationals) never to appear in the World Series. That season, however, the Rangers won their first postseason series and made their first appearance in the World Series, only to lose to the San Francisco Giants in five games.\n\n\nDuring the offseason, Chuck Greenberg, who purchased the Rangers from Tom Hicks during the 2010 season along with Nolan Ryan, sold his interest in the team to Ryan, making him the Rangers' principal owner.[11] Notable player departures during the offseason included pitcher Cliff Lee and outfielder/designated hitter Vladimir Guerrero (both to free agency) and catcher Bengie Molina, who retired. Notable free agent additions during the offseason included pitchers Yoshinori Tateyama and Brandon Webb, catcher Yorvit Torrealba, and third-baseman Adri\u00e1n Beltr\u00e9. In January 2011, as part of a three-way trade with the Toronto Blue Jays and Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, the Rangers acquired catcher Mike Napoli in exchange for pitcher Frank Francisco. During the season, the team acquired pitcher Koji Uehara from the Baltimore Orioles in exchange for infielder Chris Davis, and Mike Adams from the San Diego Padres in exchange for two minor-league pitchers. Pitcher Arthur Rhodes was released and signed with the St. Louis Cardinals days later; as a result, Rhodes would have been entitled to receive a World Series ring regardless of which team won.[12][13]\n\n\nWith the exception of one day in late April and a brief stretch in early May, the Rangers led the American League West for most of the season. They finished the season with a franchise record 96\u201366 (.593 winning percentage) and won their second consecutive and 5th overall division title, 10 games ahead of the second-place Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. They also set a franchise record for home attendance of 2,946,949.[14] Texas also earned the most shutouts in the American League. All 5 members of the opening day starting rotation stayed in the rotation for the entire year. C. J. Wilson tied for the league lead in starts with 34 while Derek Holland tied for second in shutouts with 4 (tied for first in the American League), with each pitcher racking up at least 13 wins. The offense also had another good year with 3 players getting 30-plus home runs for the first time in team history, and Ian Kinsler completing his second 30\u201330 season.\n\n\nIn the postseason, the Rangers were the #2 seed in the AL. They defeated the wild-card Tampa Bay Rays in four games in the American League Division Series. They then defeated the third-seeded Detroit Tigers in six games in the American League Championship Series to reach their second consecutive appearance in the World Series.\n\n\nThe Rangers lost home-field advantage in the World Series as a result of the AL team, managed by Rangers manager Ron Washington, losing the 2011 All-Star Game, when Ranger ace C. J. Wilson surrendered the game-winning three-run homer to Prince Fielder.[6]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cardinals third baseman David Freese experienced a torrid hitting streak in the postseason, being named NLCS MVP in 2011.\n### St. Louis Cardinals[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2011 St. Louis Cardinals season\n\nThe Cardinals made their first World Series appearance since 2006, when they defeated the Detroit Tigers 4 games to 1 to win their National League-leading 10th World Series title. This was manager Tony La Russa's 6th World Series appearance as manager and his third with the Cardinals. The Cardinals' last postseason appearance was in 2009, where they were swept by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League Division Series. They finished the 2010 season with a record of 86\u201376 (.531), finishing in second place in the National League Central standings, 5 games behind the Cincinnati Reds.\n\n\nDuring the 2010 offseason, the team signed new contracts with manager Tony La Russa and picked up All-Star slugger Albert Pujols' club option. Notable offseason departures included shortstop Brendan Ryan (traded to the Seattle Mariners) and relief pitcher Blake Hawksworth (traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers). Additionally, during the offseason the team announced that ace pitcher Adam Wainwright would miss the entire season due to Tommy John surgery. Notable offseason additions included shortstop Ryan Theriot, outfielder Lance Berkman, catcher Gerald Laird, and infielder Nick Punto. In late April, after a number of blown saves, the Cardinals removed pitcher Ryan Franklin from the closer role, and released him on June 29. On July 27, the Cardinals sent outfielder Colby Rasmus and pitchers Trever Miller, Brian Tallet, and P. J. Walters to the Toronto Blue Jays in exchange for pitchers Edwin Jackson, Marc Rzepczynski, and Octavio Dotel, and outfielder Corey Patterson. They then acquired Rafael Furcal from the Dodgers in exchange for Alex Castellanos, a minor-league outfielder. On August 11, the team signed free agent pitcher Arthur Rhodes, who had been released by the Texas Rangers days earlier.\n\n\nThe Cardinals spent much of the early part of the 2011 season in first place in the NL Central standings but dropped to second place for good on July 27. On August 25, the team trailed the Atlanta Braves in the NL wild card standings by 10+1\u20442 games. The Cardinals amassed a 21\u20139 record from August 26 to September 27, while the Braves were 10\u201319 over that same interval. Meanwhile, on September 23, the Milwaukee Brewers clinched the NL Central division title. On September 28, with the Cardinals and Braves tied atop the Wild Card standings on the last day of the regular season, the Cardinals routed the Houston Astros 8\u20130 in Houston, while the Braves lost at home to the Philadelphia Phillies 4\u20133 in 13 innings, securing the Cardinals' second wild card postseason berth in franchise history. St. Louis finished with a record of 90\u201372, 6 games behind the Brewers in the NL Central but one ahead of the Braves in the Wild Card. They defeated the overall #1 seed Philadelphia Phillies in the National League Division Series 3 games to 2, and then defeated the second-seeded Milwaukee Brewers (who were the first team in history to reach both NLCS and ALCS and the team the Cardinals faced in the 1982 World Series) in six games in the National League Championship Series.\n\n\n\n## Summary[edit]\n\n\n*St. Louis won the series, 4\u20133.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Game | Date | Score | Location | Time | Attendance\u00a0\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | October 19 | Texas Rangers \u2013 2, **St. Louis Cardinals** \u2013 3 | Busch Stadium | 3:06 | 46,406[15] |\n| 2 | October 20 | **Texas Rangers** \u2013 2, St. Louis Cardinals \u2013 1 | Busch Stadium | 3:04 | 47,288[16] |\n| 3 | October 22 | **St. Louis Cardinals** \u2013 16, Texas Rangers \u2013 7 | Rangers Ballpark in Arlington | 4:04 | 51,462[17] |\n| 4 | October 23 | St. Louis Cardinals \u2013 0, **Texas Rangers** \u2013 4 | Rangers Ballpark in Arlington | 3:07 | 51,539[18] |\n| 5 | October 24 | St. Louis Cardinals \u2013 2, **Texas Rangers** \u2013 4 | Rangers Ballpark in Arlington | 3:31 | 51,459[19] |\n| 6 | October 27\u2020 | Texas Rangers \u2013 9, **St. Louis Cardinals** \u2013 10 (11) | Busch Stadium | 4:33 | 47,325[20] |\n| 7 | October 28 | Texas Rangers \u2013 2, **St. Louis Cardinals** \u2013 6 | Busch Stadium | 3:17 | 47,399[21] |\n\n\n\u2020: Postponed from October 26 due to rain[22]\n\n\n\n## Game summaries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chris Carpenter, the winning pitcher in Game 1.\n### Game 1[edit]\n\n\n\n\nOctober 19, 2011 7:05\u00a0pm (CDT) at Busch Stadium in St. Louis, Missouri 48\u00a0\u00b0F (9\u00a0\u00b0C), drizzle\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Texas | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 6 | 0\n |\n| **St. Louis** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | X | 3 | 6 | 0\n |\n| **WP:** Chris Carpenter (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** C.

After a double by Matt Holliday, Lance Berkman hit a single to drive both runners in. The lead wouldn't last long. Mike Napoli hit a two-run home run to tie the game in the very next inning. David Freese doubled in the sixth with one out, and moved to third on a wild pitch. After Yadier Molina struck out, and Nick Punto walked, Allen Craig entered the game, pinch-hitting for Carpenter. Alexi Ogando relieved Wilson, and tried to finish off the inning. Craig hit a 1\u20132 pitch down the right field line that was just out of reach of a sliding Nelson Cruz. Freese scored to give St. Louis the lead. In the seventh, the Cardinals ran into trouble as Cruz singled and Napoli walked to put two on with one out. Marc Rzepczynski came on to face pinch-hitter Craig Gentry and struck him out. Pinch-hitter Esteban Germ\u00e1n was the next batter. Rzepczynski struck him out as well. In the ninth, closer Jason Motte pitched an easy 1\u20132\u20133 inning to give St. Louis the win. Controversy surrounded the inning, as Adri\u00e1n Beltr\u00e9 was the victim of a blown call. Beltr\u00e9 grounded a ball to third, and Descalso threw the ball to first for the out, but replays showed he fouled the ball off his foot.\n\n\n\n![](image)Michael Young hit the go-ahead sacrifice fly in the ninth inning for the Rangers.\n### Game 2[edit]\n\n\n\n\nOctober 20, 2011 7:05\u00a0pm (CDT) at Busch Stadium in St. Louis, Missouri 51\u00a0\u00b0F (11\u00a0\u00b0C), mostly clear\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Texas** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 2 | 5 | 1\n |\n| St. Louis | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 6 | 1\n |\n| **WP:** Mike Adams (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Jason Motte (0\u20131) \u00a0 **Sv:** Neftal\u00ed Feliz (1)**Attendance:** 47,288Boxscore |\n\n\nGame\u00a02 saw a pitchers' duel between Jaime Garc\u00eda and Colby Lewis. Both starters kept the game scoreless through the first six innings. A pair of excellent defensive plays by Elvis Andrus stopped a couple of Cardinals rallies. In the seventh, David Freese again started a rally for St. Louis, much like in Game\u00a01. He singled with one out, and moved to third on a single by Nick Punto with two outs. Allen Craig pinch-hit for Garc\u00eda to face Alexi Ogando, setting up almost the same exact situation from the previous night. Again, Craig beat Ogando with a single to right field to drive in Freese. Jason Motte was brought in to save the game in the ninth. Ian Kinsler led off with a bloop single, and stole second with Andrus batting. Andrus singled into center field, and moved to second on the throw home, which got by Albert Pujols for an error. With runners on second and third, and none out, Tony La Russa switched in Arthur Rhodes for Motte. Consecutive sacrifice flies from Josh Hamilton and Michael Young gave Texas the lead. Neftal\u00ed Feliz came on in the ninth, and allowed a leadoff walk to Yadier Molina, but retired the next three batters in order to end the game and tie the Series at one game apiece.\n\n\n\n![](image)Albert Pujols hit three home runs for the Cardinals in Game 3.\n### Game 3[edit]\n\n\n\n\nOctober 22, 2011 7:05\u00a0pm (CDT) at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington, Texas 79\u00a0\u00b0F (26\u00a0\u00b0C), cloudy\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **St. Louis** | 1 | 0 | 0 | 4 | 3 | 4 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 16 | 15 | 0\n |\n| Texas | 0 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 3 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 7 | 13 | 3\n |\n| **WP:** Lance Lynn (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Matt Harrison (0\u20131)**Home runs:**STL: Allen Craig (1), Albert Pujols 3 (3)TEX: Michael Young (1), Nelson Cruz (1)**Attendance:** 51,462Boxscore |\n\n\nAfter a total of just eight runs scored in the first two games in St. Louis, the offense of the two lineups scored a combined 23 runs on a historic night in Arlington in which Albert Pujols had what was described as \"the greatest individual hitting performance in World Series history\".[23]\n\n\nAllen Craig hit a home run in the first to put the Cardinals up 1\u20130. In the fourth after a controversial call at first base by umpire Ron Kulpa on a force play and subsequent single put runners on first and second with one out, David Freese's RBI double made it 2\u20130 Cardinals. After an intentional walk loaded the bases, two runs scored on a throwing error by Mike Napoli before Ryan Theriot's RBI single made it 5\u20130 Cardinals. Starter Matt Harrison was pulled from the game after the inning's second out. In the bottom of the inning, a lead-off home run by Michael Young and, two batters later, a two-run home run by Nelson Cruz, made it 5\u20133 Cardinals. Napoli then singled to knock starter Kyle Lohse out of the game. Napoli moved to third on a groundout and single, but was tagged out at home trying to score on Ian Kinsler's fly out to end the inning.\n\n\nIn the fifth, the Cardinals loaded the bases with no outs on a single and two walks off of Scott Feldman before Freese's groundout scored a run, then a two-run double by Yadier Molina made the score 8\u20133 Cardinals. In the bottom of the inning, Texas got two leadoff singles off of Fernando Salas before Young drove in a run with a double. Lance Lynn relieved Salas and allowed an RBI single to Adrian Beltre, then, one out later, a sacrifice fly to Napoli to make it 8\u20136 Cardinals.\n\n\nAlbert Pujols, who had been hitless through the first two games, then hit a 423\u00a0ft (129\u00a0m) home run off Alexi Ogando in the sixth inning after a leadoff single and walk to make it 11\u20136 Cardinals. An error, single and walk loaded the bases before Mike Gonzalez relieved Ogando and allowed a sacrifice fly to Molina. Next inning, Pujols's two-run home run after a two-out walk off of Gonzalez made it 14\u20136 Cardinals. The Rangers scored their last run of the game in the bottom of the inning when Beltre hit a leadoff double off of Lynn, moved to third on a groundout and scored on Napoli's sacrifice fly off of Octavio Dotel.\n\n\nThe Cardinals added to their lead in the eighth when Freese singled with one out off of Mark Lowe and pinch-runner Daniel Descalso scored on Molina's double. Then in the ninth, Pujols hit his third home run of the game, giving him six RBIs, off of Darren Oliver. Mitchell Boggs retired Texas in order in the bottom of the ninth as the Cardinals won 16\u20137, leading the Series by 2\u20131.\n\n\nAlbert Pujols joined Babe Ruth (1926, 1928) and Reggie Jackson (1977) as the only players in baseball history up to that time to hit three home runs in a World Series game. (Pablo Sandoval would also accomplish the feat the following year.) Pujols was 5-for-6 with two singles, three HRs, four runs scored, and six RBIs. Yadier Molina added two doubles, driving in four runs. David Freese continued his postseason 13-game hitting streak getting two hits (one double), driving in two runs. Pujols became the first player in World Series history[24] to get hits in four consecutive innings: fourth (single), fifth (single), sixth (HR, three RBIs), and seventh (HR, two RBIs). He tied records for most HRs (3), most hits (5), and most RBIs (6) in a World Series game, and established a new record with 14 total bases.[25]\n\n\nThe 16 runs scored by the Cardinals were the most runs scored in a World Series game since 2002, when the San Francisco Giants scored 16 against the Anaheim Angels in Game 5.\n\n\n\n![](image)Mike Napoli hit a home run for the Rangers for the second time in the series.\n### Game 4[edit]\n\n\n\n\nOctober 23, 2011 7:05\u00a0pm (CDT) at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington, Texas 73\u00a0\u00b0F (23\u00a0\u00b0C), clear\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| St. Louis | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 0\n |\n| **Texas** | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 0 | 0 | X | 4 | 6 | 0\n |\n| **WP:** Derek Holland (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Edwin Jackson (0\u20131)**Home runs:**STL: NoneTEX: Mike Napoli (2)**Attendance:** 51,539Boxscore |\n\n\nAfter a high-scoring affair the night before, Derek Holland quieted the Cardinals' bats as he pitched 8+1\u20443 innings of two-hit baseball. Lance Berkman had both of the Cardinals' two hits. Josh Hamilton's first-inning RBI double put the Rangers in front for only the second time in the Series. A three-run home run by Mike Napoli provided Holland a comfortable 4\u20130 lead. The Cardinals managed a small rally in the ninth, but were unable to score against closer Neftal\u00ed Feliz.[26]\n\n\nCoincidentally, this game was one of two major DFW vs. St. Louis sporting events taking place in Arlington on that day, as the NFL's Dallas Cowboys and St. Louis Rams had played at nearby Cowboys Stadium that afternoon; during the opening coin toss, Berkman and Hamilton, in uniform, had each served as honorary captains for their city's team.[27]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mitch Moreland (above) and Adri\u00e1n Beltr\u00e9 (below) hit solo home runs to tie the game up for the Rangers. ![](image)\n### Game 5[edit]\n\n\n\n\nOctober 24, 2011 7:05\u00a0pm (CDT) at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington, Texas 80\u00a0\u00b0F (27\u00a0\u00b0C), mostly clear\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| St. Louis | 0 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 7 | 1\n |\n| **Texas** | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 2 | X | 4 | 9 | 2\n |\n| **WP:** Darren Oliver (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Octavio Dotel (0\u20131) \u00a0 **Sv:** Neftal\u00ed Feliz (2)**Home runs:**STL: NoneTEX: Mitch Moreland (1), Adri\u00e1n Beltr\u00e9 (1)**Attendance:** 51,459Boxscore |\n\n\nStarters C. J. Wilson and Chris Carpenter faced off again. Wilson walked two batters, Matt Holliday and Lance Berkman, in the second inning and both came in to score, aided in part by an error by David Murphy. However, despite the Rangers walking nine batters in the game (including Albert Pujols three times intentionally), the Cardinals did not score again, leaving 12 runners on base. Mitch Moreland hit a home run in the third, and Adri\u00e1n Beltr\u00e9 hit one in the sixth, to tie the score at 2\u20132.\n\n\nThe Rangers' half of the eighth featured a series of bullpen mix-ups by the Cardinals, leaving Tony La Russa without closer Jason Motte in a crucial situation. After Michael Young led off the inning with a double, La Russa sent both Motte (a right-hander) and left-handed reliever Marc Rzepczynski to begin warmups. However, Cardinals bullpen coach Derek Lilliquist later stated that he only heard Rzepczynski's name called. When La Russa saw that Motte was not warming up, he made a second call to the bullpen, but this time Lilliquist thought he heard La Russa call for reliever Lance Lynn, who was supposedly unavailable for the game due to throwing 47 pitches in Game\u00a03.[28]\n\n\nDotel intentionally walked Nelson Cruz, whereupon La Russa summoned Rzepczynski to face the left-handed hitting Murphy. Usually, the Rangers would counter with a right-handed pinch-hitter, such as Craig Gentry or Yorvit Torrealba. However, Murphy stayed in the game, and hit a grounder off Rzepczynski, loading the bases. With Motte not yet available (La Russa thought he was warming up, but he was not yet ready), La Russa was forced to match Rzepczynski against the right-handed hitting Mike Napoli, who hit a two-run double scoring Young and Cruz. After a Moreland strikeout, La Russa called for Motte from the bullpen, only to be surprised to see Lynn coming out (it was then when he learned of the mix-ups). Lynn then was asked to intentionally walk Ian Kinsler, making him only the third pitcher in World Series history to make a relief appearance solely to serve an intentional walk.[28]\n\n\nNeftal\u00ed Feliz came in to save the game in the ninth, his second save of the Series.\n\n\n\n### Game 6[edit]\n\n\n\n\nOctober 27, 2011 7:05\u00a0pm (CDT) at Busch Stadium in St. Louis, Missouri 52\u00a0\u00b0F (11\u00a0\u00b0C), partly cloudy\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Texas | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 9 | 15 | 2\n |\n| **St. Louis** | 2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 10 | 13 | 3\n |\n| **WP:** Jake Westbrook (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Mark Lowe (0\u20131)**Home runs:**TEX: Adri\u00e1n Beltr\u00e9 (2), Nelson Cruz (2), Josh Hamilton (1)STL: Lance Berkman (1), Allen Craig (2), David Freese (1)**Attendance:** 47,325Boxscore |\n\n\nGame\u00a06, moved from October 26 to 27 due to rain and because the stadium was not domed, was a rematch of Game\u00a02's starters: Cardinals lefty Jaime Garc\u00eda and Rangers starter Colby Lewis. Texas jumped on top immediately, with Josh Hamilton driving in Ian Kinsler in the top of the first. The Cardinals responded quickly with a two-run Lance Berkman home run in the bottom half. Kinsler tied the game in the top of the second with a ground-rule double, scoring Craig Gentry. Garc\u00eda was pulled after only three innings (and 59 pitches) and replaced with Fernando Salas. Leading off the top of the fourth, Matt Holliday misplayed a Nelson Cruz pop fly, putting Cruz at second. Mike Napoli singled him home to once again give Texas the lead.\n\n\nThe Cardinals jumped right back in the game, taking advantage of a Michael Young error and scoring on a Yadier Molina groundout to knot the game at three. David Freese started off the top of the fifth by dropping a routine pop fly (the third consecutive half-inning to begin with an error), which immediately turned into the go-ahead run for Texas on Young's double. Colby Lewis was cruising for the Rangers until the bottom of the sixth. After an Albert Pujols strikeout, Berkman singled to third. Matt Holliday grounded into a possible double play which was mishandled at first by Michael Young (his second error of the game), leaving all runners safe. Lewis walked the bases loaded and was pulled for Alexi Ogando, who promptly walked Yadier Molina to force in a run. With the Cardinals in a prime position to rally ahead, Matt Holliday, standing 90 feet (27\u00a0m) away as the possible go-ahead run, was picked off at third by catcher Mike Napoli. Holliday injured his finger sliding in on the play and was forced to leave the game. After Ogando walked Nick Punto, Derek Holland came in to pitch and the Rangers were able to slip out of the inning with the score still tied.\n\n\n\n![](image)Josh Hamilton hit the go ahead two-run home run in the 10th inning for the Rangers.\nLance Lynn came on to pitch for the Cardinals in the top of the seventh and was promptly greeted with back-to-back home runs by Adri\u00e1n Beltr\u00e9 and Nelson Cruz to put Texas up by two. Ian Kinsler added his second RBI later in the inning to make the score 7\u20134, Rangers. In the bottom of the eighth, Allen Craig (who entered the game as Holliday's replacement) hit a home run to pull the Cardinals within two. Rangers closer Neftal\u00ed Feliz entered in the bottom of the ninth to deliver the Rangers their first ever World Series Championship. After striking out Ryan Theriot, Feliz faced Albert Pujols. Facing possibly his last at-bat as a Cardinal, Pujols hit Feliz's first pitch into left field for a double. Feliz walked Lance Berkman to put the tying run on first, but got Craig to take a called third strike. The Rangers were one out away from their first-ever World Series championship title as David Freese stepped to the plate. Down to his last strike, Freese hit Feliz's pitch past a leaping Nelson Cruz off the right field wall for a triple, tying the game at seven. (To this day baseball fans debate whether or not Cruz should have been replaced by Endy Chavez and whether or not Cruz could have caught the ball, thereby winning the world series for Texas, had he positioned himself differently, timed his leap differently, or had a better read on the ball.)\n\n\n\n![](image)Lance Berkman, however, hit the tying single in the Cardinals' half of the 10th inning.\n![](image)David Freese, who hit a two-RBI triple that tied the game in the 9th inning for the Cardinals, hit a solo home run in the 11th to stave off elimination for St. Louis.\nSent into extra innings, Jason Motte went out for his second inning of work. Elvis Andrus singled, then the Rangers' MVP candidate Josh Hamilton put Texas up again with a towering two-run home run. Down 9\u20137, and out of bench players, the Cardinals once again faced only three outs until elimination. Left-hander Darren Oliver came in to pitch for the Rangers. St. Louis players Daniel Descalso and Jon Jay hit back-to-back singles, and starting pitcher Kyle Lohse was called to bunt. Lohse's sacrifice bunt put the tying run in scoring position. With right-handers coming up, right-hander Scott Feldman replaced Oliver on the mound. Ryan Theriot's sacrifice groundout scored Descalso, cutting the Rangers' lead to 9\u20138, and following an intentional walk to Pujols, Berkman stepped up to the plate. Feldman got ahead on the count 1\u20132 on a foul ball. Berkman worked the count to 2\u20132, and the Rangers were once again one strike away from their first championship title. Berkman then smacked Feldman's next pitch into center field for a single, scoring Jay and tying the game once again. It was the first time in World Series history that a team came back from two different two-run deficits in the ninth inning or later in the same game.[*citation needed*] The Rangers failed to score in the top of the 11th, bringing David Freese to lead off the bottom of the inning. Freese hit Mark Lowe's 3\u20132 pitch into the grass of the center field batter's eye for a game-winning home run, forcing the World Series to a Game 7 for the first time since 2002.\n\n\nOf the last 13 instances in which a Major League team won a Game 6 at home to force a Game 7 in the postseason, all but two went on to win Game 7. The exceptions were the New York Mets in the 2006 NLCS against, coincidentally, the Cardinals; and the Boston Red Sox in the 1975 World Series against the Cincinnati Reds.[29]\n\n\nFreese's walk-off home run was the fourth that won[30] in a Game\u00a06 in World Series history.[31][32]\n\n\nThe Cardinals set two World Series milestones in their Game 6 win\u2014the first team to come back from deficits in both the 9th and 10th innings, and the first team to score in the 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th innings.[33] On *Mike and Mike in the Morning* the next day, ESPN senior baseball analyst Buster Olney called it the greatest game in the history of baseball.[34]\n\n\nGame 6 was originally scheduled for Wednesday, October 26, but was postponed due to heavy rain in the forecast; this was the first time that a World Series game was postponed since 2006. Although rain was only falling fairly lightly in St. Louis when this decision was made, MLB officials did not want a repeat of Game 5 of the 2008 World Series (which was suspended after the top of the sixth inning and resumed two days later).[22]\n\n\nDavid Freese and Lance Berkman became the third and fourth players[35] in World Series history to get game-tying hits with their team one out from elimination.[36]\n\n\nFreese, who grew up a Cardinal fan in the suburbs of St. Louis, said that as he was circling the bases after his home run, he was thinking about a similar walk-off homer by Jim Edmonds for the Cardinals in Game 6 of the 2004 National League Championship Series in Busch Stadium II. After Freese said he remembered that home run, Lance Berkman, who played for the losing Houston Astros in that series, said \"So do I.\"[37]\n\n\n\n![](image)Allen Craig hit the go-ahead home run in the 3rd inning that put the Cardinals ahead for good.\n### Game 7[edit]\n\n\n\n\nOctober 28, 2011 7:05\u00a0pm (CDT) at Busch Stadium in St. Louis, Missouri 52\u00a0\u00b0F (11\u00a0\u00b0C), mostly clear\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Texas | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 6 | 0\n |\n| **St. Louis** | 2 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 0 | X | 6 | 7 | 1\n |\n| **WP:** Chris Carpenter (2\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Matt Harrison (0\u20132)**Home runs:**TEX: NoneSTL: Allen Craig (3)**Attendance:** 47,399Boxscore |\n\n\nBefore Game\u00a07, the Cardinals replaced Matt Holliday, who sprained his wrist in Game\u00a06, on their roster with Adron Chambers.[38]\n\n![](image)Crowds fill the stadium and parking lots during Game 7Josh Hamilton and Michael Young had RBI doubles in the first inning against Chris Carpenter, who became the first pitcher in a decade[39] to make three starts in one Series thanks to the unnecessary postponement of game 6 due to forecasted rain that did not occur.

This was the first World Series for play-by play announcer Dan Shulman and analysts Orel Hershiser and Bobby Valentine.[51] ESPN Deportes Radio aired the Series for Spanish language listeners, with Ernesto Jerez and Guillermo Celis announcing.\n\n\nLocally, the two teams' flagship stations broadcast the Series with their respective announcing crews. The Rangers' broadcasts aired on KESN (with Eric Nadel and Steve Busby announcing),[52] while the Cardinals' broadcasts aired on KMOX (with Mike Shannon and John Rooney announcing).[53] Due to contractual obligations, the non-flagship stations on the teams' radio networks carried the ESPN Radio broadcasts of the games, although the local broadcasts were available on XM Satellite Radio and to Gameday Audio subscribers at MLB.com.\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Simon Brotherton and Josh Chetwynd called the games for BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra.[54]\n\n\n\n## Aftermath[edit]\n\n\n![](image)La Russa during the World Series parade.\nThe 2011 World Series was only the second World Series ever in which a team, one strike away from elimination, came back to win\u2014with the Cardinals, in fact, achieving this feat twice in Game\u00a06. The first was the 1986 World Series, in which the New York Mets rallied from a 5\u20133 deficit in the bottom of the 10th inning of Game\u00a06 to win the game and, later, the decisive Game\u00a07.[55][56]\n\n\nThis was the third and final World Series title for Cardinals manager Tony La Russa, who initially announced his retirement on October 31, 2011, after 33 seasons as a major league manager.[57] La Russa later came out of retirement and served as manager of the Chicago White Sox in 2021 and 2022. La Russa had previously led the Cardinals (2006) and Oakland Athletics (1989) to World Series championships. Former Cardinals catcher Mike Matheny, who played for the 2004 Cardinals that lost the World Series, was hired to replace him.\n\n\nAfter the New York Giants won Super Bowl XLVI during the offseason, some news organizations, among them *The St. Louis Post-Dispatch*, compared the Cardinals to the Giants, invoking Al Michaels's call of the Giants winning the Super Bowl: \"The New York Giants, given the last rites by many in December, are the Super Bowl Champs in February.\"[58]\n\n\nThe Rangers became the first team to lose in the World Series in consecutive years since the Atlanta Braves in 1991 and 1992 and the first American League team to do so since the New York Yankees in 1963 and 1964.\n\n\nAlbert Pujols and C. J. Wilson would later end up signing with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in the offseason, in one of the deepest free-agent classes in recent MLB history, while the Rangers obtained the rights to sign Japanese star pitcher Yu Darvish to replace Wilson. In his first press conference as a Ranger, Darvish was asked about Game 6 of the World Series where David Freese hit a walk-off home run in the bottom of the 11th, and said \"If it was last year [2011], I would have given up a home run and lost the game. This year [2012] I won't let that happen.\"[59] Pujols returned to the Cardinals in 2022, which was the last season of his career.[60]\n\n\nBoth teams would advance into the postseason again in the following year, both as wild cards. The Rangers lost to the Baltimore Orioles in the inaugural American League Wild Card game, and would not make the postseason again until 2015. The Cardinals won the inaugural National League Wild Card game against Atlanta. They then defeated the Washington Nationals in the NLDS before falling to the San Francisco Giants in the NLCS.\n\n\nSt. Louis would return to the World Series in 2013, continuing the pattern of Giants and Cardinals exchanging pennant victories. However, the Cardinals lost to the Boston Red Sox in six games before losing to San Francisco again in the 2014 NLCS, 4 games to 1.\n\n\nLa Russa would be inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2014.[61]\n\n\nThe Series marked the beginning of a decade in which all current Missouri-based teams in the four major American sports leagues would win a championship. The Kansas City Royals won the 2015 World Series, the St. Louis Blues won the 2019 Stanley Cup Finals, and the Kansas City Chiefs won Super Bowl LIV following the 2019 season.\n\n\n10 years after the 2011 World Series, Ron Washington would finally win a World Series ring after 44 years in MLB, as he served as the third base coach for the Atlanta Braves. In addition, four players from the 2011 Rangers' World Series team later won a world championship with the Boston Red Sox: Mike Napoli and Koji Uehara in 2013, and Ian Kinsler and Mitch Moreland in 2018.\n\n\n\n> \n> \"May the ghosts of 2011 be forever erased!\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n- Rangers radio announcer Eric Nadel, after the Rangers won the 2023 World Series\n\nThe Rangers would return to the World Series again in 2023 where they would finally win it all as they defeated the Arizona Diamondbacks 4 games to 1 to clinch their first title in franchise history. Pitching coach Mike Maddux was on the coaching staff for all of Texas' World Series appearances, having served under Washington for the first two before he was rehired under Bruce Bochy during the third.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* 2011 Asia Series\n* 2011 Japan Series\n* 2011 Korean Series\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"2011 World Series\". *Baseball-Reference*.

Three teams are owned by the major league club, while three others\u2014the Memphis Redbirds, Springfield Cardinals, and Peoria Chiefs\u2014are independently owned.\n\n\nThe Cardinals have been affiliated with the Triple-A Memphis Redbirds of the International League since 1998, making it the longest-running active affiliation in the organization among teams not owned by the Cardinals. The longest affiliation in team history was the 37-year relationship with the Texas League's Houston Buffaloes from 1919 to 1942 and 1946 to 1958. Their newest affiliate is the High-A Peoria Chiefs of the Midwest League, which became a Cardinals affiliate in 2013. \n\n\nGeographically, St. Louis' closest domestic affiliate is the Peoria Chiefs, which are approximately 146 miles (235\u00a0km) away. St. Louis' furthest domestic affiliates are the Single-A Palm Beach Cardinals of the Florida State League and the Rookie Florida Complex League Cardinals of the Florida Complex League, which share a facility some 998 miles (1,606\u00a0km) away.\n\n\n\n\n## Current affiliates[edit]\n\n\nThe St. Louis Cardinals farm system consists of six minor league affiliates.[1]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Class\n | Team\n | League\n | Location\n | Ballpark\n | Affiliated\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Triple-A | Memphis Redbirds | International League | Memphis, Tennessee | AutoZone Park | 1998\n |\n| Double-A | Springfield Cardinals | Texas League | Springfield, Missouri | Hammons Field | 2005\n |\n| High-A | Peoria Chiefs | Midwest League | Peoria, Illinois | Dozer Park | 2003\n |\n| Single-A | Palm Beach Cardinals | Florida State League | Jupiter, Florida | Roger Dean Chevrolet Stadium | 2003\n |\n| Rookie | FCL Cardinals | Florida Complex League | Jupiter, Florida | Roger Dean Chevrolet Stadium | 2007\n |\n| DSL Cardinals | Dominican Summer League | Santo Domingo, Distrito Nacional | Las Am\u00e9ricas Complex\n | 2022\n |\n\n\n## Past affiliates[edit]\n\n\n### Key[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Season** | Each year is linked to an article about that particular Cardinals season.\n |\n\n\n### 1919\u20131962[edit]\n\n\nMinor League Baseball operated with five classes (Double-A, Class A, Class B, Class C, and Class D) from 1919 to 1935.[2] Class A1, between Double-A and Class A, was added in 1936.[3] The minors continued to operate with these six levels through 1945.[3] Triple-A was established as the highest classification in 1946, and Class A1 became Double-A, with Class A through D remaining.[3] These six levels continued through 1962.[2] The Pacific Coast League (PCL) was reclassified from Triple-A to Open in 1952 due to the possibility of becoming a third major league. This arrangement ended following the 1957 season when the relocation of the National League's Dodgers and Giants to the West Coast ended any chance of the PCL being promoted.[2]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Season\n

1963\u20131989[edit]\n\n\nPrior to the 1963 season, Major League Baseball (MLB) initiated a reorganization of Minor League Baseball that resulted in a reduction from six classes to four (Triple-A, Double-A, Class A, and Rookie) in response to the general decline of the minors throughout the 1950s and early-1960s when leagues and teams folded due to shrinking attendance caused by baseball fans' preference for staying at home to watch MLB games on television. The only change made within the next 27\u00a0years was Class A being subdivided for the first time to form Class A Short Season in 1966.[2]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Season\n | Triple-A | Double-A | Class A | Class A Short Season | Rookie | Ref(s). |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1963 | Atlanta Crackers | Tulsa Oilers | Billings MustangsBrunswick CardinalsWinnipeg Goldeyes | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | [48] |\n| 1964 | Jacksonville Suns | Tulsa Oilers\n | Raleigh CardinalsRock Hill CardinalsWinnipeg Goldeyes\n | \u2014\n | SRL Cardinals | [49] |\n| 1965 | Jacksonville Suns\n | Tulsa Oilers\n | Cedar Rapids CardinalsRaleigh CardinalsRock Hill Cardinals\n | \u2014\n | FRL Cardinals | [50] |\n| 1966 | Tulsa Oilers | Arkansas Travelers | Cedar Rapids CardinalsRock Hill CardinalsSt. Petersburg Cardinals | \u2014\n | GCL Cardinals | [51] |\n| 1967 | Tulsa Oilers\n | Arkansas Travelers\n | Cedar Rapids CardinalsModesto RedsSt. Petersburg Cardinals\n | Lewiston Broncs | GCL Cardinals\n | [52] |\n| 1968 | Tulsa Oilers\n | Arkansas Travelers\n | Cedar Rapids CardinalsModesto RedsSt. Petersburg Cardinals\n | Lewiston Broncs\n | GCL Cardinals\n | [53] |\n| 1969 | Tulsa Oilers\n | Arkansas Travelers\n | Cedar Rapids CardinalsModesto RedsSt. Petersburg Cardinals\n | Lewiston Broncs\n | GCL Cardinals\n | [54] |\n| 1970 | Tulsa Oilers\n | Arkansas Travelers\n | Cedar Rapids CardinalsModesto RedsSt. Petersburg Cardinals\n | Lewiston Broncs\n | GCL Cardinals\n | [55] |\n| 1971 | Tulsa Oilers\n | Arkansas Travelers\n | Cedar Rapids CardinalsModesto RedsSt. Petersburg Cardinals\n | \u2014\n | GCL Cardinals\n | [56] |\n| 1972 | Tulsa Oilers\n | Arkansas Travelers\n | Cedar Rapids CardinalsModesto RedsSt. Petersburg Cardinals\n | \u2014\n | GCL CardinalsGCL Red Birds | [57] |\n| 1973 | Tulsa Oilers\n | Arkansas Travelers\n | Modesto RedsSt. Petersburg Cardinals\n | \u2014\n | GCL CardinalsGCL Red Birds\n | [58] |\n| 1974 | Tulsa Oilers\n | Arkansas Travelers\n | Modesto RedsSt. Petersburg Cardinals\n | \u2014\n | GCL Cardinals\n | [59] |\n| 1975 | Tulsa Oilers\n | Arkansas Travelers\n | St. Petersburg Cardinals\n | \u2014\n | Johnson City CardinalsGCL Cardinals\n | [60] |\n| 1976 | Tulsa Oilers\n | Arkansas Travelers\n | St. Petersburg Cardinals\n | \u2014\n | Johnson City CardinalsGCL Cardinals\n | [61] |\n| 1977 | New Orleans Pelicans | Arkansas Travelers\n | Gastonia CardinalsSt. Petersburg Cardinals\n | \u2014\n | Calgary CardinalsJohnson City Cardinals\n | [62] |\n| 1978 | Springfield Redbirds | Arkansas Travelers\n | Gastonia CardinalsSt. Petersburg Cardinals\n | \u2014\n | Calgary CardinalsJohnson City Cardinals\n | [63] |\n| 1979 | Springfield Redbirds\n | Arkansas Travelers\n | Gastonia CardinalsSt. Petersburg Cardinals\n | \u2014\n | Johnson City Cardinals\n | [64] |\n| 1980 | Springfield Redbirds\n | Arkansas Travelers\n | Gastonia CardinalsSt. Petersburg Cardinals\n | \u2014\n | Johnson City Cardinals\n | [65] |\n| 1981 | Springfield Redbirds\n | Arkansas Travelers\n | Gastonia CardinalsSt. Petersburg Cardinals\n | Erie Cardinals | Johnson City Cardinals\n | [66] |\n| 1982 | Louisville Redbirds | Arkansas Travelers\n | Gastonia CardinalsSpringfield CardinalsSt. Petersburg Cardinals\n | Erie Cardinals\n | Johnson City Cardinals\n | [67] |\n| 1983 | Louisville Redbirds\n | Arkansas Travelers\n | Macon RedbirdsSpringfield CardinalsSt. Petersburg Cardinals\n | Erie Cardinals\n | Johnson City Cardinals\n | [68] |\n| 1984 | Louisville Redbirds\n | Arkansas Travelers\n | Savannah CardinalsSpringfield CardinalsSt. Petersburg Cardinals\n | Erie Cardinals\n | Johnson City Cardinals\n | [69] |\n| 1985 | Louisville Redbirds\n | Arkansas Travelers\n | Savannah CardinalsSpringfield CardinalsSt. Petersburg Cardinals\n | Erie Cardinals\n | Johnson City Cardinals\n | [70] |\n| 1986 | Louisville Redbirds\n | Arkansas Travelers\n | Savannah CardinalsSpringfield CardinalsSt. Petersburg Cardinals\n | Erie Cardinals\n | Johnson City Cardinals\n | [71] |\n| 1987 | Louisville Redbirds\n | Arkansas Travelers\n | Savannah CardinalsSpringfield CardinalsSt. Petersburg Cardinals\n | Erie Cardinals\n | Johnson City Cardinals\n | [72] |\n| 1988 | Louisville Redbirds\n | Arkansas Travelers\n | Savannah CardinalsSpringfield CardinalsSt. Petersburg Cardinals\n | Hamilton Redbirds | Johnson City Cardinals\n | [73] |\n| 1989 | Louisville Redbirds\n | Arkansas Travelers\n | Savannah CardinalsSpringfield CardinalsSt. Petersburg Cardinals\n | Hamilton Redbirds\n | Johnson City CardinalsAZL CardinalsDSL Cardinals/Mets/Pirates | [74][75] |\n\n\n### 1990\u20132020[edit]\n\n\nMinor League Baseball operated with six classes from 1990 to 2020.

For the basketball trophy, see PBA Governors' Cup.\n\n\n\n\n\n![A trophy made of metal and wood](image)The Governors' Cup was awarded to winners of the International League playoffs from 1933 to 2020.\nThe International League (IL) is a Minor League Baseball league that operates in the United States at the Triple-A level, which is one grade below Major League Baseball. A champion has been determined at the end of each season since the league was formed in 1884. \n\n\nThrough 1932, champions were usually the regular-season pennant winners\u2014the team with the best win\u2013loss record at the conclusion of the season. From 1933 to 2020, postseason playoffs were held to determine champions. Participants from 1933 to 1987 were usually the four teams with the highest winning percentages. From 1988 to 2020, the four qualifiers were the division winners and one or two wild card teams. The winner of each season's playoffs was awarded the **Governors' Cup**. These playoffs and the issuing of trophy were discontinued in 2021, when the winner was the team with the best regular-season record. In 2022, the league championship was determined by a single playoff game between the East and West division winners. Beginning with the 2023 season, the league adopted a split season format, in which the league championship is determined by a best-of-three playoff series between the winners of each half of the season, with the winner meeting the champion of the Pacific Coast League in the Triple-A National Championship Game.[1]\n\n\nThe Rochester Red Wings have won 19 International League championships, more than any other team, followed by the Columbus Clippers (11) and the Baltimore Orioles, original Buffalo Bisons, and Toronto Maple Leafs (10). Among active IL franchises, Rochester has won 19 championships, the most of all teams, followed by Columbus (11) and the Durham Bulls and Syracuse Mets (8). During the era of the Governors' Cup playoffs from 1933 to 2020, the most cup titles were won by Columbus (11), followed by Rochester (10) and Syracuse (8).\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Pre-playoff era (1884\u20131932)[edit]\n\n\n![Seventeen men and two boys wearing dark suits](image)The Rochester Red Wings, known as the Hustlers in 1909 (shown), won nine championships during the pre-playoff era (1884\u20131932), more than any other team.\nThe International League was founded in 1884.[2] The modern circuit traces its roots from several predecessor leagues: the Eastern League (1884), New York State League (1885), International League (1886\u20131887), International Association (1888\u20131890), Eastern Association (1891), and Eastern League (1892\u20131911).[3] It adopted consistent use of the International League name in 1912.[3] After the cancellation of the 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic,[4] the league was known as the Triple-A East in 2021 before reverting to the International League moniker in 2022.[5][6]\n\n\nA league champion has been determined at the end of each season. With few exceptions, champions from 1884 to 1932 were simply the regular-season pennant winners\u2014the team with the best win\u2013loss record at the conclusion of the regular championship season. The first league champions were the Trenton Trentonians, who won by four games over the Lancaster Ironsides in 1884.[7] The 1891 and 1892 seasons were contested as split seasons or \"double seasons\". Under this format, the schedule was split into two parts. The team with the best record at the end of the first season won the first pennant. Standings were then reset so that all clubs had clean records to begin the second season. If the same team won both seasons, they were declared the league champion.[8] This was the case in 1891 when the original Buffalo Bisons won both halves.[9] If a different team won the second season, the two winners would meet in a playoff series to determine the champion.[8] This happened in 1892 when the Binghamton Bingoes, winners of the second season, defeated the Providence Clamdiggers, winners of the first season, four games to two.[10] In 1932, the Newark Bears became the last team to win the championship by virtue of winning the regular-season pennant before a recurring series of playoffs were instituted.[11]\n\n\n\n### Governors' Cup era (1933\u20132020)[edit]\n\n\n![A man in a dark suit](image)Frank Shaughnessy devised a playoff system that was used for the Governor's Cup playoffs to determine a league champion.\nFrank Shaughnessy, general manager of the International League's Montreal Royals, was interested in developing a way for multiple clubs to share in the excitement of postseason play. His new playoff format, devised to maintain the interest of fans and players alike during the Great Depression, provided an opportunity for four teams to compete for the league's championship. In 1933, he introduced his plan to league president Charles H. Knappe, and the result was the Governors' Cup playoffs. Several other leagues noticed the success of the \"Shaughnessy Plan\" and began using the system as well.[12]\n\n\nThe governors of Maryland, New Jersey, and New York and the lieutenant governors of the provinces of Quebec and Ontario, in which the league's eight teams were located at the time, sponsored a trophy to be awarded annually to the winner of the International League playoffs. The original trophy, designed by the supervisor of the league's umpires and silversmith W. B. Carpenter, was created out of solid silver.[12] In 1988, IL president Harold Cooper donated the trophy to the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, where it is on permanent display. A new trophy was minted in its place to be presented to the winner of the Governors' Cup playoffs.[12]\n\n\nUnder this system, the top four teams in the league, based on winning percentage, competed for the championship. From 1933 to 1987, the first round typically consisted of a best-of-seven-games series between the first and fourth-place teams and a series between the second and third-place teams. The winners of these semifinals then faced one another for the championship in a best-of-seven series. The first Governors' Cup was won in 1933 by the original Buffalo Bisons, who defeated the Rochester Red Wings, 4\u20132.[13] Sporadically from 1966 to 1980, one or both rounds were reduced to best-of-five series. From 1981 to 2020, both rounds were the best-of-five.\n\n\nThe IL utilized a divisional alignment for the first time in 1963. The first-place teams from each division, North and South, met in the first round, as did the second-place teams, with the winners meeting in the finals.[14] The circuit reverted to having no divisions in 1964 but returned to the same playoff format with North and South Divisions for 1973 and 1974.[15][16]\n\n\nFrom 1988 to 1991, the International League held an interleague partnership with the American Association, called the Triple-A Alliance, in which they played an interlocking schedule, and the leagues' champions met in the Triple-A Classic.[17] During this period, the IL was divided into East and West Divisions, and the division winners faced off in a best-of-five series to determine champions. After the dissolution of the Triple-A Alliance following the 1991 season, the International League maintained this divisional alignment but returned to having a semifinal round wherein the top two teams in each division played each other to qualify for the Governors' Cup finals.[17][18]\n\n\nThe league was split into three divisions, North, South, and West, from 1998 to 2020. Under this arrangement, the three division winners and a wild card team (the team with the best second-place record) qualified for the playoffs. The best-of-five semifinals pitted the North Division winner against the wild card team, and the South and West Division winners against each other. The winners then played in a best-of-five round to determine the champion.[19] The last team to win the championship this way was the Columbus Clippers, who won the last Governors' Cup in 2019.[20] The 2020 season was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[4]\n\n\n\n### Current era (2021\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\nThe International League ceased operations before the 2021 season in conjunction with Major League Baseball's (MLB) reorganization of Minor League Baseball.[5] In place of the International League, MLB created the Triple-A East, a circuit divided into three divisions, Northeast, Midwest, and Southeast.[21] Prior to the 2022 season, MLB renamed the Triple-A East the International League, and it carried on the history of the IL prior to reorganization.[6] Rather than hold playoffs for its championship, the Triple-A East's 2021 title was awarded to the team with the best regular-season record.[22] The Durham Bulls won this championship by four-and-a-half games ahead of the Buffalo Bisons.[23][24] Along with these changes, all references to the Governors' Cup as the championship of the International League were discontinued and a different trophy was awarded.[25][26][27] In 2022, the league was reorganized in East and West Divisions.[28] Under this alignment, the winners of each division met in a single game to determine the league champion.[29] In 2023, the regular-season was split into two halves, and the winners of each half met in a best-of-three series for the league championship.[30]\n\n\n\n## Champions[edit]\n\n\n### Pre-playoff

A league champion has determined at the end of each season. Champions have been determined by postseason playoffs, winning the regular season pennant, or being declared champion by the league office. For 2019, the league operated under a split season format in which the first place teams from each division in both the first and second halves of the season qualified for the playoffs. In the event that the same team won both halves, the team with the best win\u2013loss record over the full season qualified. The first and second half winners then competed in a best-of-five series to determine division champions. The division winners then played each other in a best-of-five series to determine a league champion.[1] As of 2022, the winners of each division from both the first and second halves of the season meet in a best-of-three division series, with the winners of the two division series meeting in a best-of-three championship series.[2]\n\n\nThe 2020 season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic,[3] and the league ceased operations before the 2021 season in conjunction with Major League Baseball's (MLB) reorganization of Minor League Baseball.[4] In place of the Eastern League, MLB created the Double-A Northeast, a 12-team circuit divided into two divisions.[5] Prior to the 2022 season, MLB renamed the Double-A Northeast as the Eastern League, and it carried on the history of the league prior to reorganization.[6] In 2021, the Double-A Northeast held a best-of-five series between the top two teams in the league, regardless of division standings, to determine a league champion.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## League champions[edit]\n\n\n*Score and finalist information is only presented when postseason play occurred.

A champion has been determined at the end of each season since the league was formed in 1964. \n\n\nThrough 1970, champions were the regular-season pennant winners\u2014the team with the best win\u2013loss record at the conclusion of the regular season. The 1971 title was decided in a postseason series between the two teams with the best records. From 1972 to 1975, the winners of each of two divisions competed in a series to determine champions. The league operated using a split season format from 1976 to 2020. Under this format, the winners of each half within each division played for the division championship, and the division winners met to play for the SL title. The 2021 winner was crowned via a series between the two teams with the best full-season records. As of 2022, the winners of each division from both the first and second halves of the season meet in a best-of-three division series, with the winners of the two division series meeting in a best-of-three championship series.\n\n\nThe Birmingham Barons have won seven Southern League championships, more than any other team, followed by the Jacksonville Suns (6) and Montgomery Rebels (5). Among active SL franchises, Birmingham has won seven championships, the most of all teams, followed by the Tennessee Smokies (4) and Chattanooga Lookouts (3).\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nThe Southern League was founded in 1964.[1] A league champion has been determined at the end of each season. Champions from 1964 to 1970 were simply the regular-season pennant winners\u2014the team with the best win\u2013loss record at the conclusion of the regular championship season.[2] The first league champions were the Lynchburg White Sox, who won by one game over the Birmingham Barons in 1964.[2]\n\n\nIn 1971, the league merged with the Texas League to form the Dixie Association, an interleague partnership in which they played an interlocking schedule, and the leagues' champions met to determine a Dixie Association champion.[3] The Southern League championship was determined via a best-of-three playoff series between the top two teams in the league, based on winning percentage. The top-seeded Charlotte Hornets defeated the Asheville Tourists, 2\u20131.[2] Charlotte then won the Dixie Association title over the Texas League champion Arkansas Travelers, in three-straight games.[2] The partnership was dissolved after the season.[4]\n\n\nThe Southern League divided its teams into two divisions in 1972. From 1972 to 1975, the winners of each division met in a best-of-five series to determine a champion.[5] In 1976, the circuit adopted a split season format while maintaining its divisional alignment.[6] Under this arrangement, the schedule was split into two parts. The team with the best record in each division at the end of the first half won the first-half division title. Standings were then reset so that all clubs had clean records to begin the second half. Second-half division titles were decided in the same manner. Then, the first and second-half winners in each division met to determine division champions. These winners played for the Southern League championship.[7]\n\n\nThe first four-team playoff, held in 1976, was won by the Western Division champion Montgomery Rebels over the Eastern Division champion Orlando Twins, 3\u20131.[6] The 1976 playoffs featured a one-game semifinal divisional round and a best-of-five championship series.[6] Both rounds were the best-of-three in 1977 and 1978.[6] The 1979 playoffs had a best-of-three divisional round and a best-of-five final.[6] From 1980 to 2020, both rounds were the best-of-five.[8] Initially, if one team won both halves, they received a bye into the championship round.[6] Beginning in 1982, the team in that division with the second-place full-season record was awarded a wild card berth and became the division champion's opponent.[9]\n\n\nThe 2020 season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[10] The Southern League ceased operations before the 2021 season in conjunction with Major League Baseball's (MLB) reorganization of Minor League Baseball.[11] In place of the league, MLB created the Double-A South.[12] Prior to the 2022 season, MLB renamed the Double-A South the Southern League, and it carried on the history of the circuit prior to reorganization.[13] In 2021, the Double-A South held a best-of-five series between the two teams with the best records, regardless of division standings, to determine a league champion.[14] The top-seeded Mississippi Braves bested the Montgomery Biscuits, 3\u20132, for the title.[15]\n\n\nIn 2022, the Southern League returned to the split-season divisional format it has used for the majority of its existence. The winners of each half in a division vie for the division championship. The second-place overall team is awarded a wild card berth in the event the same team wins both halves. The division champions then compete for the Southern League championship. Both rounds are the best-of-three games.[16]\n\n\n\n## Champions[edit]\n\n\n### Pre-playoff champions (1964\u20131970)[edit]\n\n\n\n\nKey\n| **Record** | Regular-season win\u2013loss record |\n|

From 1911 to 2020, it was part of affiliated Minor League Baseball. A league champion is determined at the end of each season. Champions have been determined by postseason playoffs or winning the regular season pennant. Currently, the two teams with the highest winning percentages in each of two divisions, East and West, are eligible for the postseason. These teams compete in a single championship game to determine a league champion.\n\n\n\n\n## League champions[edit]\n\n\n*Score and finalist information is only presented when postseason play occurred.
