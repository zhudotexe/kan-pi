US$1 million; €0.7 million) for its administrative expenses associated with the award as well as 1 million Swedish kronor (until the end of 2008) to include information about the award on the Nobel Foundation's web site.[21]\n\n\n\n### Relation to the Nobel Prizes[edit]\n\n\nThe Prize in Economics is not one of the Nobel Prizes endowed by Alfred Nobel in his will.[9][22][23] However, the nomination process, selection criteria, and awards presentation of the Prize in Economic Sciences are performed in a manner similar to that of the original Nobel Prizes.[5][13][19][24]\n\n\nLaureates are announced with the Nobel Prize laureates, and receive the award at the same ceremony.[9] The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awards the prize \"in accordance with the rules governing the award of the Nobel Prizes instituted through his [Alfred Nobel's] will\",[13] which stipulate that the prize be awarded annually to \"those who ... shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind\".[25]\n\n\n\n## Award nomination and selection process[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Committee for the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel\n\n![](image)Announcement of the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences 2008\nAccording to its official website, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences \"administers a researcher exchange with academies in other countries and publishes six scientific journals. Every year the Academy awards the Nobel Prizes in Physics and in Chemistry, the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, the Crafoord Prize and a number of other large prizes\".[14]\n\n\nEach September the Academy's Economics Prize Committee, which consists of five elected members, \"sends invitations to thousands of scientists, members of academies and university professors in numerous countries, asking them to nominate candidates for the Prize in Economics for the coming year. \n\n\nMembers of the Academy and former laureates are also authorised to nominate candidates.\"[13][14][26] All proposals and their supporting evidence must be received before February 1.[23] The proposals are reviewed by the Prize Committee and specially appointed experts. Before the end of September, the committee chooses potential laureates. If there is a tie, the chairman of the committee casts the deciding vote. \n\n\nMembers of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences vote in mid-October to determine the next laureate or laureates of the Prize in Economics.[13][14][27] As with the Nobel Prizes, no more than three people can share the prize for a given year; they must still be living at the time of the Prize announcement in October; and information about Prize nominations cannot be disclosed publicly for 50 years.[23]\n\n\nLike the Nobel laureates in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, and literature, each laureate in Economics receives a diploma, gold medal, and monetary grant award document from the King of Sweden at the annual Nobel Prize Award Ceremony in Stockholm, on the anniversary of Nobel's death (December 10).[9][28]\n\n\n\n## Laureates[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of Nobel Memorial Prize laureates in Economic Sciences.\n\nThe first prize in economics was awarded in 1969 to Ragnar Frisch and Jan Tinbergen \"for having developed and applied dynamic models for the analysis of economic processes\".[29] Three women have received the prize: Elinor Ostrom, who won in 2009, Esther Duflo, who won in 2019,[30]\nand Claudia Goldin, who won in 2023. Goldin was the first woman to win the award solo.[31]\n\n\n\n### Awards to non-economists[edit]\n\n\nIn February 1995, following acrimony within the selection committee pertaining to the awarding of the 1994 Prize in Economics to John Forbes Nash, the Prize in Economics was redefined as a prize in social sciences. This made it available to researchers in such topics as political science, psychology, and sociology.[32][33]\n\n\nMoreover, the composition of the Economics Prize Committee changed to include two non-economists. This has not been confirmed by the Economics Prize Committee. The members of the 2007 Economics Prize Committee are still dominated by economists, as the secretary and four of the five members are professors of economics.[34]\n\n\nIn 1978, Herbert A. Simon, whose PhD was in political science, became the first non-economist to win the prize,[*citation needed*] for his work in the fields of economics and organizational decision making. Similarly, Daniel Kahneman, a professor of psychology and public affairs at Princeton University, won the prize for work in the field of behavioral economics.\n\n\n\n## Controversies and criticisms[edit]\n\n\n### Misuse of the Nobel name[edit]\n\n\nSome critics argue that the prestige of the Prize in Economics derives in part from its association with the Nobel Prizes, an association that has often been a source of controversy. Among them is the Swedish human rights lawyer Peter Nobel, a great-grandnephew of Ludvig Nobel.[35]\n\n\nNobel accuses the awarding institution of misusing his family's name, and states that no member of the Nobel family has ever had the intention of establishing a prize in economics.[36] He explained that \"Nobel despised people who cared more about profits than society's well-being\", saying that \"There is nothing to indicate that he would have wanted such a prize\", and that the association with the Nobel prizes is \"a PR coup by economists to improve their reputation\".[35]\n\n\n\n### Accusations of bias[edit]\n\n\nCritics cite the apparent snub of Joan Robinson as evidence of the committee's bias towards mainstream economics,[37][38] though heterodox economists like Friedrich Hayek (Austrian School) and Ronald Coase (associated with new institutional economics) have won.[*dubious – discuss*]\n\n\nAccording to Maggie Koerth of *FiveThirtyEight*, as of 2016 \"The typical winner of the Nobel in economics is a 67-year-old man, born in the United States, who is working at the University of Chicago when he wins.\"[39]\n\n\n\n### Undue authority[edit]\n\n\nIn his speech at the 1974 Nobel Prize banquet, Friedrich Hayek stated that had he been consulted on the establishment of a Nobel Prize in economics, he would \"*have decidedly advised against it*\"[33][40] primarily because, *\"The Nobel Prize confers on an individual an authority which in economics no man ought to possess. ... This does not matter in the natural sciences. Here the influence exercised by an individual is chiefly an influence on his fellow experts; and they will soon cut him down to size if he exceeds his competence. But the influence of the economist that mainly matters is an influence over laymen: politicians, journalists, civil servants and the public generally*.\"[40] Nevertheless, Hayek accepted the award.\n\n\n\n### Controversial prizewinners[edit]\n\n\n#### Friedrich Hayek[edit]\n\n\nAccording to Samuel Brittan of the *Financial Times*, both former Swedish minister of finance (Kjell-Olof Feldt) and Swedish former minister of commerce (Gunnar Myrdal) wanted the prize abolished, saying, \"Myrdal rather less graciously wanted the prize abolished because it had been given to such reactionaries as Hayek (and afterwards Milton Friedman).\"[33] Relatedly, it has been noted that several members of the awarding committee have been affiliated with the Mont Pelerin Society.[41]\n\n\n\n#### Milton Friedman[edit]\n\n\nMilton Friedman was awarded the 1976 prize in part for his work on monetarism. Awarding the prize to Friedman caused international protests.[42] Friedman was accused of supporting the military dictatorship in Chile because of the relation of economists of the University of Chicago to Pinochet, and a controversial six-day trip[43] he took to Chile during March 1975 (less than two years after the coup that deposed President Salvador Allende). Friedman himself answered that he never was an adviser to the dictatorship, but only gave some lectures and seminars on inflation and met with officials, including Augusto Pinochet, in Chile.[44]\n\n\nFour Nobel Prize laureates – George Wald, Linus Pauling, David Baltimore and Salvador Luria – wrote letters in October 1976 to *The New York Times* protesting Friedman's award.[45][46]\n\n\n\n#### Robert Aumann[edit]\n\n\nThe 2005 prize to Robert Aumann was criticized by the European press[47] for his alleged use of game theory to justify his stance against the dismantling of Israeli settlements in occupied Palestine.\n\n\n\n### Expansion of scope[edit]\n\n\nThe 1994 prize to John Forbes Nash caused controversy within the selection committee.[48][49] This resulted in a change to the rules governing the committee during 1994: The prize's scope was redefined as one of social sciences, and Prize Committee members were limited to serve for three years.[32]\n\n\n\n## Alternative names[edit]\n\n\nThe award's official Swedish name is *Sveriges riksbanks pris i ekonomisk vetenskap till Alfred Nobels minne*.

US$1 million; €0.7 million) for its administrative expenses associated with the award as well as 1 million Swedish kronor (until the end of 2008) to include information about the award on the Nobel Foundation's web site.[21]\n\n\n\n### Relation to the Nobel Prizes[edit]\n\n\nThe Prize in Economics is not one of the Nobel Prizes endowed by Alfred Nobel in his will.[9][22][23] However, the nomination process, selection criteria, and awards presentation of the Prize in Economic Sciences are performed in a manner similar to that of the original Nobel Prizes.[5][13][19][24]\n\n\nLaureates are announced with the Nobel Prize laureates, and receive the award at the same ceremony.[9] The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awards the prize \"in accordance with the rules governing the award of the Nobel Prizes instituted through his [Alfred Nobel's] will\",[13] which stipulate that the prize be awarded annually to \"those who ... shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind\".[25]\n\n\n\n## Award nomination and selection process[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Committee for the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel\n\n![](image)Announcement of the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences 2008\nAccording to its official website, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences \"administers a researcher exchange with academies in other countries and publishes six scientific journals. Every year the Academy awards the Nobel Prizes in Physics and in Chemistry, the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, the Crafoord Prize and a number of other large prizes\".[14]\n\n\nEach September the Academy's Economics Prize Committee, which consists of five elected members, \"sends invitations to thousands of scientists, members of academies and university professors in numerous countries, asking them to nominate candidates for the Prize in Economics for the coming year. \n\n\nMembers of the Academy and former laureates are also authorised to nominate candidates.\"[13][14][26] All proposals and their supporting evidence must be received before February 1.[23] The proposals are reviewed by the Prize Committee and specially appointed experts. Before the end of September, the committee chooses potential laureates. If there is a tie, the chairman of the committee casts the deciding vote. \n\n\nMembers of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences vote in mid-October to determine the next laureate or laureates of the Prize in Economics.[13][14][27] As with the Nobel Prizes, no more than three people can share the prize for a given year; they must still be living at the time of the Prize announcement in October; and information about Prize nominations cannot be disclosed publicly for 50 years.[23]\n\n\nLike the Nobel laureates in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, and literature, each laureate in Economics receives a diploma, gold medal, and monetary grant award document from the King of Sweden at the annual Nobel Prize Award Ceremony in Stockholm, on the anniversary of Nobel's death (December 10).[9][28]\n\n\n\n## Laureates[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of Nobel Memorial Prize laureates in Economic Sciences.\n\nThe first prize in economics was awarded in 1969 to Ragnar Frisch and Jan Tinbergen \"for having developed and applied dynamic models for the analysis of economic processes\".[29] Three women have received the prize: Elinor Ostrom, who won in 2009, Esther Duflo, who won in 2019,[30]\nand Claudia Goldin, who won in 2023. Goldin was the first woman to win the award solo.[31]\n\n\n\n### Awards to non-economists[edit]\n\n\nIn February 1995, following acrimony within the selection committee pertaining to the awarding of the 1994 Prize in Economics to John Forbes Nash, the Prize in Economics was redefined as a prize in social sciences. This made it available to researchers in such topics as political science, psychology, and sociology.[32][33]\n\n\nMoreover, the composition of the Economics Prize Committee changed to include two non-economists. This has not been confirmed by the Economics Prize Committee. The members of the 2007 Economics Prize Committee are still dominated by economists, as the secretary and four of the five members are professors of economics.[34]\n\n\nIn 1978, Herbert A. Simon, whose PhD was in political science, became the first non-economist to win the prize,[*citation needed*] for his work in the fields of economics and organizational decision making. Similarly, Daniel Kahneman, a professor of psychology and public affairs at Princeton University, won the prize for work in the field of behavioral economics.\n\n\n\n## Controversies and criticisms[edit]\n\n\n### Misuse of the Nobel name[edit]\n\n\nSome critics argue that the prestige of the Prize in Economics derives in part from its association with the Nobel Prizes, an association that has often been a source of controversy. Among them is the Swedish human rights lawyer Peter Nobel, a great-grandnephew of Ludvig Nobel.[35]\n\n\nNobel accuses the awarding institution of misusing his family's name, and states that no member of the Nobel family has ever had the intention of establishing a prize in economics.[36] He explained that \"Nobel despised people who cared more about profits than society's well-being\", saying that \"There is nothing to indicate that he would have wanted such a prize\", and that the association with the Nobel prizes is \"a PR coup by economists to improve their reputation\".[35]\n\n\n\n### Accusations of bias[edit]\n\n\nCritics cite the apparent snub of Joan Robinson as evidence of the committee's bias towards mainstream economics,[37][38] though heterodox economists like Friedrich Hayek (Austrian School) and Ronald Coase (associated with new institutional economics) have won.[*dubious – discuss*]\n\n\nAccording to Maggie Koerth of *FiveThirtyEight*, as of 2016 \"The typical winner of the Nobel in economics is a 67-year-old man, born in the United States, who is working at the University of Chicago when he wins.\"[39]\n\n\n\n### Undue authority[edit]\n\n\nIn his speech at the 1974 Nobel Prize banquet, Friedrich Hayek stated that had he been consulted on the establishment of a Nobel Prize in economics, he would \"*have decidedly advised against it*\"[33][40] primarily because, *\"The Nobel Prize confers on an individual an authority which in economics no man ought to possess. ... This does not matter in the natural sciences. Here the influence exercised by an individual is chiefly an influence on his fellow experts; and they will soon cut him down to size if he exceeds his competence. But the influence of the economist that mainly matters is an influence over laymen: politicians, journalists, civil servants and the public generally*.\"[40] Nevertheless, Hayek accepted the award.\n\n\n\n### Controversial prizewinners[edit]\n\n\n#### Friedrich Hayek[edit]\n\n\nAccording to Samuel Brittan of the *Financial Times*, both former Swedish minister of finance (Kjell-Olof Feldt) and Swedish former minister of commerce (Gunnar Myrdal) wanted the prize abolished, saying, \"Myrdal rather less graciously wanted the prize abolished because it had been given to such reactionaries as Hayek (and afterwards Milton Friedman).\"[33] Relatedly, it has been noted that several members of the awarding committee have been affiliated with the Mont Pelerin Society.[41]\n\n\n\n#### Milton Friedman[edit]\n\n\nMilton Friedman was awarded the 1976 prize in part for his work on monetarism. Awarding the prize to Friedman caused international protests.[42] Friedman was accused of supporting the military dictatorship in Chile because of the relation of economists of the University of Chicago to Pinochet, and a controversial six-day trip[43] he took to Chile during March 1975 (less than two years after the coup that deposed President Salvador Allende). Friedman himself answered that he never was an adviser to the dictatorship, but only gave some lectures and seminars on inflation and met with officials, including Augusto Pinochet, in Chile.[44]\n\n\nFour Nobel Prize laureates – George Wald, Linus Pauling, David Baltimore and Salvador Luria – wrote letters in October 1976 to *The New York Times* protesting Friedman's award.[45][46]\n\n\n\n#### Robert Aumann[edit]\n\n\nThe 2005 prize to Robert Aumann was criticized by the European press[47] for his alleged use of game theory to justify his stance against the dismantling of Israeli settlements in occupied Palestine.\n\n\n\n### Expansion of scope[edit]\n\n\nThe 1994 prize to John Forbes Nash caused controversy within the selection committee.[48][49] This resulted in a change to the rules governing the committee during 1994: The prize's scope was redefined as one of social sciences, and Prize Committee members were limited to serve for three years.[32]\n\n\n\n## Alternative names[edit]\n\n\nThe award's official Swedish name is *Sveriges riksbanks pris i ekonomisk vetenskap till Alfred Nobels minne*.

He was awarded half of the 2021 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences \"for his empirical contributions to labour economics\", with Joshua Angrist and Guido Imbens jointly awarded the other half.[5][6]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and career[edit]\n\n\nDavid Card was born in Guelph, Ontario, in 1956.[7] His parents were dairy farmers.[8] Card was originally was pursuing a degree in physics, before eventually switching to economics.[9] He then earned his Bachelor of Arts degree from Queen's University in 1978 and his Ph.D. degree in economics in 1983 from Princeton University, after completing a doctoral dissertation titled \"Indexation in long term labor contracts\" under the supervision of Orley Ashenfelter.[10][11]\n\n\nCard began his career at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business, where he was Assistant Professor of Business Economics for 2 years. He was on the faculty at Princeton from 1983 to 1997, before moving to Berkeley; from 1990 to 1991 he served as a visiting professor at Columbia University.[12] From 1988 to 1992, Card was Associate Editor of the *Journal of Labor Economics* and from 1993 to 1997, he was co-editor of *Econometrica*. From 2002 to 2005, he was co-editor of *The American Economic Review*.[12]\n\n\n\n## Academic work[edit]\n\n\nIn the early 1990s, Card received much attention for his finding, together with his then Princeton University colleague Alan B. Krueger that, contrary to widely accepted beliefs among economists, the minimum wage increase in New Jersey did not result in job reduction of fast food companies in that state.[13][14][6] While the methodology (see difference in differences) and its claim have been disputed (see minimum wage for discussion), later studies of minimum wage increases have tended to confirm Card and Krueger's findings,[15] and many economists, including Joseph Stiglitz and Paul Krugman,[16] accept these findings.[17]\n\n\nDavid Card has also made contributions to research on immigration,[18] education,[19] job training and inequality. Much of Card's work centers on a comparison between the United States and Canada in various situations. On immigration, Card's research has shown that the economic impact of new immigrants is minimal. Card has done several case studies on the rapid assimilation of immigrant groups, finding that they have little or no impact on wages. For example, Card studied the economic impacts of the Mariel boatlift, and compared the economic effects in Miami to those in Atlanta, Houston, Los Angeles and Tampa, which receive fewer Cuban immigrants.[8] Card found that despite the drastic increase in low-skilled labor in Miami by 7%, wages for the low-skilled workers were not significantly affected. Furthermore, he found that overall unemployment rates and wages for the labor market as a whole in Miami were unchanged by the sudden influx of immigrants.[20][8] In an interview with *The New York Times*, Card said, \"I honestly think the economic arguments [against immigration] are second order. They are almost irrelevant.\"[8] This does not imply, however, that Card believes immigration should be increased, merely that immigrants do not pose a threat to the labour market.[8]\n\n\nDespite the fact that Card sometimes researches issues with strong political implications, he does not publicly take a stand on political issues or make policy suggestions. Nevertheless, his work is regularly cited in support of increased immigration and minimum wage legislation.[21][20]\n\n\nHe served as the expert witness for Harvard in the Harvard admissions case.[22]\n\n\n\n## \"Myth and Measurement: The New Economics of Minimum Wage\"[edit]\n\n\n### Purpose[edit]\n\n\nDavid Card and Alan B. Krueger utilized their work to challenge a widely held belief that a higher minimum wage would result in lower employment, a belief held by 90 percent of professional economists.[23] They were dissatisfied with the existing approach that was used to evaluate minimum wage and employment, instead desiring natural experiments that would provide stronger evidence on the topic. Though a major purpose of the book was to showcase this misconception, perhaps an even greater purpose was present, through the usage of natural experiments the authors acted as a driving force in the establishment of empirical research to test the underlying economic model, furthering their purpose of further establishing economic research as a quantitative, research based field.[24]\n\n\n\n### Conclusion & Implications[edit]\n\n\nMyth and Measurement is a monumental economic work, which contains two primary conclusions, minimum wage does not necessarily adversely influence employment and a need to establish new models that are applied to the low-wage market.[25] Throughout the work the usage of numerous samples of minimum wage changes, state and federal, demonstrates that there is no notable decrease in employment when the wage floor level is raised, as demonstrated through all data in the work indicating either an increase, no change, or insignificant decrease in employment.[26] The final conclusion derives from the many anomalies present in minimum wage when evaluated under the standard market model, such as differences in wages amongst same skill workers, workers of varying ability receiving the same pay, the spillover effect, and minimum wage employers attracting more applicants than if minimum wage was not present, these conclusions suggest that the low-wage market does not fall into accordance with the standard labor model.[27] The proposed alternative models place an emphasis on avoiding the problems of the standard labor market, these models are non-static, placing an emphasis on being dynamic. These models would not make the same unambiguous predictions and would allow for consideration of other wage setting factors, thus allowing for a more complete encasement of the low-wage market. Card describes two key implications of the work, policy and economic research implications. The first described implication of the work describes that there is too great of an emphasis placed on minimum wage policy, with those in opposition exaggerating the influence on employment and those in favor overemphasizing the effects on poverty. The focus of the policy debate, according to Card, should be the distributional effects of minimum wage, how minimum wage influences wage inequality, which the findings present suggest that it will counteract the growth experienced in the 1980s.[28] Finally, Card believes that this work will greatly influence economic research in two manners, establishing prespecified conditions and the importance of firm-level microdata. Prespecified conditions will allow for broad agreement amongst researchers in regard to methodology, he believed that this work would allow for acceptance of this standard in economics. The value of firm-level microdata which would allow for a deeper understanding of factors that determine wages and alter the analysis of a variety of topics allowing for greater precision in data sets. Card concludes the work through emphasizing the importance of empirical research to create a more complete understanding of the low-wage market.[29]\n\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\nHe was the recipient of the 1995 John Bates Clark Medal, awarded to \"that American economist under the age of forty who is judged to have made the most significant contribution to economic thought and knowledge\" for his work related to the minimum wage as well as the economic effects of the Mariel boatlift.[8] He gave the 2009 Richard T. Ely Lecture of the American Economic Association in San Francisco. A 2011 survey of economics professors named Card their fifth favorite living economist under the age of 60.[30] Along with N. Gregory Mankiw, he was elected vice president of the American Economic Association for 2014.[31]\n\n\nHe has received along with Richard Blundell the 2014 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in Economics, Finance and Management category for \"their contributions to empirical microeconomics,\" in the words of the jury's citation. \"Motivated by important empirical questions, they developed and estimated appropriate econometric models, making significant methodological contributions in the process. Both are known for their attention to institutional detail, careful and innovative research design, rigorous application of econometric tools, and dispassionate reporting of results.\"[32]\n\n\nCard was elected as a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences in 2021.[33] He won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2021.[6]\n\n\n\n## Publications[edit]\n\n\n### Books and Papers[edit]\n\n\n* Card, David; Raphael, Steven, eds.

He was awarded half of the 2021 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences \"for his empirical contributions to labour economics\", with Joshua Angrist and Guido Imbens jointly awarded the other half.[5][6]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and career[edit]\n\n\nDavid Card was born in Guelph, Ontario, in 1956.[7] His parents were dairy farmers.[8] Card was originally was pursuing a degree in physics, before eventually switching to economics.[9] He then earned his Bachelor of Arts degree from Queen's University in 1978 and his Ph.D. degree in economics in 1983 from Princeton University, after completing a doctoral dissertation titled \"Indexation in long term labor contracts\" under the supervision of Orley Ashenfelter.[10][11]\n\n\nCard began his career at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business, where he was Assistant Professor of Business Economics for 2 years. He was on the faculty at Princeton from 1983 to 1997, before moving to Berkeley; from 1990 to 1991 he served as a visiting professor at Columbia University.[12] From 1988 to 1992, Card was Associate Editor of the *Journal of Labor Economics* and from 1993 to 1997, he was co-editor of *Econometrica*. From 2002 to 2005, he was co-editor of *The American Economic Review*.[12]\n\n\n\n## Academic work[edit]\n\n\nIn the early 1990s, Card received much attention for his finding, together with his then Princeton University colleague Alan B. Krueger that, contrary to widely accepted beliefs among economists, the minimum wage increase in New Jersey did not result in job reduction of fast food companies in that state.[13][14][6] While the methodology (see difference in differences) and its claim have been disputed (see minimum wage for discussion), later studies of minimum wage increases have tended to confirm Card and Krueger's findings,[15] and many economists, including Joseph Stiglitz and Paul Krugman,[16] accept these findings.[17]\n\n\nDavid Card has also made contributions to research on immigration,[18] education,[19] job training and inequality. Much of Card's work centers on a comparison between the United States and Canada in various situations. On immigration, Card's research has shown that the economic impact of new immigrants is minimal. Card has done several case studies on the rapid assimilation of immigrant groups, finding that they have little or no impact on wages. For example, Card studied the economic impacts of the Mariel boatlift, and compared the economic effects in Miami to those in Atlanta, Houston, Los Angeles and Tampa, which receive fewer Cuban immigrants.[8] Card found that despite the drastic increase in low-skilled labor in Miami by 7%, wages for the low-skilled workers were not significantly affected. Furthermore, he found that overall unemployment rates and wages for the labor market as a whole in Miami were unchanged by the sudden influx of immigrants.[20][8] In an interview with *The New York Times*, Card said, \"I honestly think the economic arguments [against immigration] are second order. They are almost irrelevant.\"[8] This does not imply, however, that Card believes immigration should be increased, merely that immigrants do not pose a threat to the labour market.[8]\n\n\nDespite the fact that Card sometimes researches issues with strong political implications, he does not publicly take a stand on political issues or make policy suggestions. Nevertheless, his work is regularly cited in support of increased immigration and minimum wage legislation.[21][20]\n\n\nHe served as the expert witness for Harvard in the Harvard admissions case.[22]\n\n\n\n## \"Myth and Measurement: The New Economics of Minimum Wage\"[edit]\n\n\n### Purpose[edit]\n\n\nDavid Card and Alan B. Krueger utilized their work to challenge a widely held belief that a higher minimum wage would result in lower employment, a belief held by 90 percent of professional economists.[23] They were dissatisfied with the existing approach that was used to evaluate minimum wage and employment, instead desiring natural experiments that would provide stronger evidence on the topic. Though a major purpose of the book was to showcase this misconception, perhaps an even greater purpose was present, through the usage of natural experiments the authors acted as a driving force in the establishment of empirical research to test the underlying economic model, furthering their purpose of further establishing economic research as a quantitative, research based field.[24]\n\n\n\n### Conclusion & Implications[edit]\n\n\nMyth and Measurement is a monumental economic work, which contains two primary conclusions, minimum wage does not necessarily adversely influence employment and a need to establish new models that are applied to the low-wage market.[25] Throughout the work the usage of numerous samples of minimum wage changes, state and federal, demonstrates that there is no notable decrease in employment when the wage floor level is raised, as demonstrated through all data in the work indicating either an increase, no change, or insignificant decrease in employment.[26] The final conclusion derives from the many anomalies present in minimum wage when evaluated under the standard market model, such as differences in wages amongst same skill workers, workers of varying ability receiving the same pay, the spillover effect, and minimum wage employers attracting more applicants than if minimum wage was not present, these conclusions suggest that the low-wage market does not fall into accordance with the standard labor model.[27] The proposed alternative models place an emphasis on avoiding the problems of the standard labor market, these models are non-static, placing an emphasis on being dynamic. These models would not make the same unambiguous predictions and would allow for consideration of other wage setting factors, thus allowing for a more complete encasement of the low-wage market. Card describes two key implications of the work, policy and economic research implications. The first described implication of the work describes that there is too great of an emphasis placed on minimum wage policy, with those in opposition exaggerating the influence on employment and those in favor overemphasizing the effects on poverty. The focus of the policy debate, according to Card, should be the distributional effects of minimum wage, how minimum wage influences wage inequality, which the findings present suggest that it will counteract the growth experienced in the 1980s.[28] Finally, Card believes that this work will greatly influence economic research in two manners, establishing prespecified conditions and the importance of firm-level microdata. Prespecified conditions will allow for broad agreement amongst researchers in regard to methodology, he believed that this work would allow for acceptance of this standard in economics. The value of firm-level microdata which would allow for a deeper understanding of factors that determine wages and alter the analysis of a variety of topics allowing for greater precision in data sets. Card concludes the work through emphasizing the importance of empirical research to create a more complete understanding of the low-wage market.[29]\n\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\nHe was the recipient of the 1995 John Bates Clark Medal, awarded to \"that American economist under the age of forty who is judged to have made the most significant contribution to economic thought and knowledge\" for his work related to the minimum wage as well as the economic effects of the Mariel boatlift.[8] He gave the 2009 Richard T. Ely Lecture of the American Economic Association in San Francisco. A 2011 survey of economics professors named Card their fifth favorite living economist under the age of 60.[30] Along with N. Gregory Mankiw, he was elected vice president of the American Economic Association for 2014.[31]\n\n\nHe has received along with Richard Blundell the 2014 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in Economics, Finance and Management category for \"their contributions to empirical microeconomics,\" in the words of the jury's citation. \"Motivated by important empirical questions, they developed and estimated appropriate econometric models, making significant methodological contributions in the process. Both are known for their attention to institutional detail, careful and innovative research design, rigorous application of econometric tools, and dispassionate reporting of results.\"[32]\n\n\nCard was elected as a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences in 2021.[33] He won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2021.[6]\n\n\n\n## Publications[edit]\n\n\n### Books and Papers[edit]\n\n\n* Card, David; Raphael, Steven, eds.

He is a co-founder and co-director of the MIT's School Effectiveness & Inequality Initiative,[7] which studies the relationship between human capital and income inequality in the U.S.\n\n\n\n\n## Biography[edit]\n\n\nAngrist was born to a Jewish family in Columbus, Ohio, and raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he graduated from Taylor Allderdice High School in 1977.[8][9] Angrist received his B.A. in economics from Oberlin College in 1982. He lived in Israel from 1982 until 1985 and served as a paratrooper in the Israeli Defence Forces.[10] Angrist received an M.A. and a Ph.D. in economics from Princeton University in 1987 and 1989, respectively. His doctoral dissertation, *Econometric Analysis of the Vietnam Era Draft Lottery*, was supervised by Orley Ashenfelter[11] and later published in parts in the *American Economic Review*.[12] After completing his Ph.D., Angrist joined Harvard University as an assistant professor until 1991, when he returned to Israel as a senior lecturer (equivalent to an Assistant Professor in the US system) at the Hebrew University.[13] After being promoted to associate professor at Hebrew University, he joined MIT's Economics Department in 1996 as associate professor, before being raised to full professor in 1998. Since 2008, he has been MIT's Ford Professor of Economics and teaches econometrics and labor economics to its students. He additionally served as the Wesley Clair Mitchell Visiting Professor at Columbia University in 2018.[14] Angrist is affiliated with the National Bureau of Economic Research,[15] the IZA Institute of Labor Economics, the American Economic Association, American Statistical Association, Econometric Society, Population Association of America and the Society of Labor Economists. In terms of professional service, he has performed editorial duties at the journals *Econometrica*, *American Economic Review*, *American Economic Journal: Applied Economics*, *Journal of Business and Economic Statistics*, *Economics Letters*, *Labour Economics* and the *Journal of Labor Economics*.\n\n\nAngrist holds dual US–Israeli citizenship[16] and lives in Brookline, Massachusetts.[8]\n\n\n\n## Research[edit]\n\n\nAngrist's research interests include the economics of education and school reform, social programs and the labor market, the effects of immigration, labor market regulation and institutions, and econometric methods for program and policy evaluation.[17] He ranks among the top 50 out of over 56,000 economists registered on IDEAS/RePEc in terms of research output.[18] He is a frequent co-author of Guido Imbens, Alan B. Krueger, Victor Lavy, Parag Pathak and Jörn-Steffen Pischke.[19] Together with Pischke, Angrist published *Mostly Harmless Econometrics* in 2009, in which they explore econometric tools used by empirical researchers.[20] In 2014, Angrist and Pischke released *Mastering 'Metrics': The Path from Cause to Effect*, which is targeted at undergraduate econometrics students.\n\n\n\n### Economics of education[edit]\n\n\n#### Research on the returns to schooling[edit]\n\n\nThe bulk of Angrist's research has concentrated on the economics of education, beginning with the returns to schooling. In one early study, Angrist and Krueger exploited the relationship between children's season of birth and educational attainment that is due to policies and laws setting ages for school start and compulsory schooling, finding that returns to education are close to their OLS estimates[21] and that compulsory attendance laws constrain roughly 10% of students to stay in school who would have otherwise left.[22] Another early attempt at using IV to estimate returns to schooling by Angrist and Krueger was to exploit the Vietnam-era draft lottery.[23] However, while their later research on split-sample IVs confirmed the findings of their compulsory schooling research, it failed to support the returns to schooling estimates derived from the draft-lottery research.[24] Angrist further used variation in U.S. compulsory schooling laws in research with Daron Acemoglu in order to estimate human-capital externalities, which they found to be about 1% and not statistically significant.[25] Angrist has also studied the strong decrease in the economic returns to schooling in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the 1980s.[26] Together with Lavy, Angrist has also explored the returns to schooling in Morocco, exploiting a change in its language of instruction from French to Arabic to find that policy substantially reduced Moroccan youths' returns to schooling by deteriorating their French writing skills.[27]\n\n\n\n#### Research on the determinants of student learning[edit]\n\n\nAnother strand of Angrist's research in the economics of education concerns the impact of various inputs and rules on learning. For instance, in further work with Lavy, Angrist exploited Maimonides' rule, which limits class size to 40 students, in order to study the impact of class size on scholastic achievement in Israeli schools, finding that class size reduction substantially increase test scores for 4th and 5th graders, albeit not for 3rd graders.[28] In further research at Israeli schools, they find that teacher training can cost-effectively improve students' test scores (at least in secular schools),[29] that computer-aided instruction doesn't [30] and that cash incentives raised high school achievement among girls (by inducing them to increase time invested into exam preparation) but were ineffective for boys.[31] Similarly, in a study by Angrist, Philip Oreopoulos and Daniel Lang comparing the impact of academic support services, financial incentives and a combination of both on Canadian college first-year students, the combined treatment raised the grades of women throughout their first and second years but had no impact on men.[32] In research on school vouchers for private schools in Colombia with Eric Bettinger, Erik Bloom, Elizabeth King and Michael Kremer, Angrist found voucher recipients 10 pp more likely to finish lower secondary school, 5-7 pp more likely to complete high school, and to score 0.2 standard deviations higher on tests, suggesting that the vouchers' benefits likely exceeded their $24 cost.[33][34] Another subject of Angrist's research are peer effects in education,[35] which he has e.g. explored with Kevin Lang in the context of METCO's school integrations or with Atila Abdulkadiroglu and Parag Pathak in Boston's and New York City's over-subscribed exam schools, though the effects that they find are brief and modest in both cases.[36][37] With regard to the effect of teacher testing, which Angrist has studied with Jonathan Guryan in the U.S., he finds that state-mandated teacher testing raises teachers' wages without raising their quality, though it decreases teacher diversity by reducing the fraction of new teachers who are Hispanic.[38] In work with Lavy and Analia Schlosser, Angrist has also explored Becker's hypothesis on a trade-off between child quality and quantity by exploiting variation in twin births and parental preferences for compositions of siblings of mixed sexes, with evidence rejecting the hypothesis.[39]\n\n\n\n##### Research on charter schools[edit]\n\n\nSince the late 2000s, Angrist has conducted extensive research on charter schools in the U.S. with Pathak, Abdulkadiroglu, Susan Dynarski, Thomas Kane, and Christopher Walters. For instance, studying the KIPP Lynn Academy, they estimate that KIPP Lynn attendance increased students' math scores by 0.35 SD and their English scores by 0.12 SD,[40] with most of the gains accruing to students with limited English proficiency or special education needs or those who scored low at baseline.[41] Beyond KIPP Lynn, they find attendance to Boston charter schools to generally increase test scores for middle and high school students, especially for schools with binding assignment lotteries, whereas pilot schools (public schools covered by some collective bargaining provisions and more independence concerning educational policies) generally have at best statistically insignificant or small effects on students' test scores.[42] Further research has attributed the relative efficacy of urban charter schools to these schools' embrace of the No Excuses approach to urban education which emphasizes student discipline and behaviour, traditional reading and math skills, instruction time, and selective teacher hiring.[43]\n\n\n\n### Labor economics[edit]\n\n\nSimilar to his research on the economics of education, Angrist's research on labor economics also often seeks to exploit quasi-natural experiments to identify causal relationships. In a publication derived from his dissertation, Angrist e.g. exploits the military draft lottery during the Vietnam War to estimate that fighting in Vietnam reduced veterans' lifetime earnings by about 15% relative to those of nonveterans.[44] Taking into account veterans' benefits that subsidized education and training (e.g. through the G.I. Bill), he finds that these benefits raised schooling in the U.S. by ca. 1.4 years and veterans' earnings by 6%.[45] In further work exploiting the idiosyncrasies of U.S. military recruitment, Angrist studies the labor market impact of voluntary military service in the 1980s, estimating that voluntary soldiers serving in the 1980s earned considerably more than comparable civilians while serving and experienced comparatively higher employment rates thereafter, even though it raised their long-run civilian earnings at best modestly and - for whites - reduced them.[46] Together with Krueger, Angrist also investigated with Krueger whether U.S. World War II veterans earned more than nonveterans, finding instead that they earned at most as much as comparable nonveterans.[47] Angrist and Krueger later on summarized their work on causality in labor economics in a chapter of the *Handbook of Labor Economics*, with special emphasis on controls for confounding variables, fixed effects models and difference-in-differences, instrumental variables estimation and regression discontinuity designs.[48] In another study related to the U.S. military, Angrist and John H. Johnson IV use the Gulf War to estimate the effects of work-related separations on military families, showing large differences between the impact of male and female soldiers' deployment on divorce rates and spousal labor supply.[49] In work with William Evans, Angrist exploited families' preference for having siblings of mixed sex to estimate children's impact on parental labor supply, observing that family size had no impact on husbands' labor supply and that the impact on women was being overestimated through OLS.[50] In further work with Evans, he also explored the impact of the 1970 state abortion reforms on schooling and labor market outcomes, arguing that they reduced Afro-American teen fertility and thereby raised black women's rates of high school completion, college attendance and employment.[51] In another study with Acemoglu, Angrist has also analysed the consequences of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), finding a sharp drop in employment of persons with disabilities (PwDs) shortly after its inception, thus suggesting that ADA has likely hurt PwDs' labor market outcomes.[52] Angrist has also studied the U.S. marriage market, finding—by exploiting endogamy in marriages—that high male-female sex ratios increased the likelihood of female marriage and decreased their labor force participation.[53] Together with Adriana Kugler, Angrist finds that labor market institutions that reduce labor market flexibility exacerbate native job losses from immigration, especially regarding restricted product markets.[54] Angrist and Kugler also investigated the relationship between coca prices and civil conflict in Colombia, observing that financial opportunities offered by coca cultivation fueled the conflict, with cultivated rural areas witnessing pronounced increases in violence.[55]\n\n\n\n### Econometrics[edit]\n\n\nBesides his empirical research, Angrist has also made major contributions to econometrics, especially concerning the use of instrumental variables estimations. For instance, Angrist developed a two-stage least squares (2SLS) equivalent of the efficient Wald estimator.[56] Together with Guido Imbens, he developed the concept of local average treatment effects and showed how to identify and to estimate them,[57] and how to use 2SLS to estimate the average causal effect of variable treatments.[58] In further work with Imbens and Donald Rubin, Angrist then showed how instrumental variables can be embedded within the Rubin causal model in order to identify causal effects between variables.[59] Angrist also developed with Imbens and Krueger so-called \"jackknife instrumental variables estimators\" to address the bias in 2SLS estimates in over-identified models[60] and has explored the interpretation of IV estimators in simultaneous equations models along with Imbens and Kathryn Graddy.[61] Again with Imbens, along with Alberto Abadie, he has also studied the effect of subsidized training due to the Job Training Partnership Act of 1982 on the quantiles of trainee earnings, finding large effects of JTPA on low-wage female workers but significant effects on men only for the upper half of the male trainee earnings distribution.[62] With regard to limited dependent variable models with binary endogenous regressors, Angrist argues in favour of using 2SLS, multiplicative models for conditional means, linear approximation of non-linear causal models, models for distribution effects, and quantile regression with an endogenous binary regressor.[63] Angrist has also explored the link between local average treatment effects and population average treatment effects, i.e., the external validity of IV estimates.[64] Finally, along with Victor Chernozhukov and Iván Fernández-Val, Angrist has also explored quantile regressions, showing that they minimize a weighted MSE loss function for specification error.[65]\n\n\nIn articles with Krueger as well as with Jorn-Steffen Pischke in the *Journal of Economic Perspectives*, Angrist has repeatedly made the case for a focus on the identification of causality in economics, e.g. using instrumental variables;[66] in particular, Angrist has argued in 2010 in response to Edward Leamer's 1983 critique of econometrics that microeconomics had experienced since then a \"credibility revolution\" thanks to substantial improvements in empirical research designs and renewed attention to causal relationships.[67]\n\n\n\n## Honors and awards[edit]\n\n\nAngrist is a Research Fellow at the Institute for the Study of Labor (IZA). He is also a fellow of the Econometric Society. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2006.[68] In 2007 Angrist received an honorary doctorate in Economics from the University of St. Gallen. He is the recipient of the 2011 John von Neumann Award given annually by the Rajk László College for Advanced Studies in Budapest.\n\n\nAngrist, along with Guido Imbens, won the 2021 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics.[69] The two men received one-half of the prize money of 10 million Swedish crowns ($1.14 million U.S.); the rest went to the other winner, David Card.[70] The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences wrote that:\n\n\n\n\n> \n> Data from a natural experiment are difficult to interpret . . . . For example, extending compulsory education by \n> a year for one group of students (but not another) will not affect everyone in that group in the same way. Some students would have kept studying anyway and, for them, the value of education is often not representative of the entire group. So, is it even possible to draw any conclusions about the effect of an extra year in school? In the mid-1990s, Joshua Angrist and Guido Imbens solved this methodological problem, demonstrating how precise conclusions about cause and effect can be drawn from natural experiments.[3]\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Quasi-natural experiment\n* List of Jewish Nobel laureates\n* List of Israeli Nobel laureates\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Angrist, Joshua David - Full record view - Libraries Australia Search\".\n2. **^** \"MIT Economics: Joshua Angrist\".

He is a co-founder and co-director of the MIT's School Effectiveness & Inequality Initiative,[7] which studies the relationship between human capital and income inequality in the U.S.\n\n\n\n\n## Biography[edit]\n\n\nAngrist was born to a Jewish family in Columbus, Ohio, and raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he graduated from Taylor Allderdice High School in 1977.[8][9] Angrist received his B.A. in economics from Oberlin College in 1982. He lived in Israel from 1982 until 1985 and served as a paratrooper in the Israeli Defence Forces.[10] Angrist received an M.A. and a Ph.D. in economics from Princeton University in 1987 and 1989, respectively. His doctoral dissertation, *Econometric Analysis of the Vietnam Era Draft Lottery*, was supervised by Orley Ashenfelter[11] and later published in parts in the *American Economic Review*.[12] After completing his Ph.D., Angrist joined Harvard University as an assistant professor until 1991, when he returned to Israel as a senior lecturer (equivalent to an Assistant Professor in the US system) at the Hebrew University.[13] After being promoted to associate professor at Hebrew University, he joined MIT's Economics Department in 1996 as associate professor, before being raised to full professor in 1998. Since 2008, he has been MIT's Ford Professor of Economics and teaches econometrics and labor economics to its students. He additionally served as the Wesley Clair Mitchell Visiting Professor at Columbia University in 2018.[14] Angrist is affiliated with the National Bureau of Economic Research,[15] the IZA Institute of Labor Economics, the American Economic Association, American Statistical Association, Econometric Society, Population Association of America and the Society of Labor Economists. In terms of professional service, he has performed editorial duties at the journals *Econometrica*, *American Economic Review*, *American Economic Journal: Applied Economics*, *Journal of Business and Economic Statistics*, *Economics Letters*, *Labour Economics* and the *Journal of Labor Economics*.\n\n\nAngrist holds dual US–Israeli citizenship[16] and lives in Brookline, Massachusetts.[8]\n\n\n\n## Research[edit]\n\n\nAngrist's research interests include the economics of education and school reform, social programs and the labor market, the effects of immigration, labor market regulation and institutions, and econometric methods for program and policy evaluation.[17] He ranks among the top 50 out of over 56,000 economists registered on IDEAS/RePEc in terms of research output.[18] He is a frequent co-author of Guido Imbens, Alan B. Krueger, Victor Lavy, Parag Pathak and Jörn-Steffen Pischke.[19] Together with Pischke, Angrist published *Mostly Harmless Econometrics* in 2009, in which they explore econometric tools used by empirical researchers.[20] In 2014, Angrist and Pischke released *Mastering 'Metrics': The Path from Cause to Effect*, which is targeted at undergraduate econometrics students.\n\n\n\n### Economics of education[edit]\n\n\n#### Research on the returns to schooling[edit]\n\n\nThe bulk of Angrist's research has concentrated on the economics of education, beginning with the returns to schooling. In one early study, Angrist and Krueger exploited the relationship between children's season of birth and educational attainment that is due to policies and laws setting ages for school start and compulsory schooling, finding that returns to education are close to their OLS estimates[21] and that compulsory attendance laws constrain roughly 10% of students to stay in school who would have otherwise left.[22] Another early attempt at using IV to estimate returns to schooling by Angrist and Krueger was to exploit the Vietnam-era draft lottery.[23] However, while their later research on split-sample IVs confirmed the findings of their compulsory schooling research, it failed to support the returns to schooling estimates derived from the draft-lottery research.[24] Angrist further used variation in U.S. compulsory schooling laws in research with Daron Acemoglu in order to estimate human-capital externalities, which they found to be about 1% and not statistically significant.[25] Angrist has also studied the strong decrease in the economic returns to schooling in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the 1980s.[26] Together with Lavy, Angrist has also explored the returns to schooling in Morocco, exploiting a change in its language of instruction from French to Arabic to find that policy substantially reduced Moroccan youths' returns to schooling by deteriorating their French writing skills.[27]\n\n\n\n#### Research on the determinants of student learning[edit]\n\n\nAnother strand of Angrist's research in the economics of education concerns the impact of various inputs and rules on learning. For instance, in further work with Lavy, Angrist exploited Maimonides' rule, which limits class size to 40 students, in order to study the impact of class size on scholastic achievement in Israeli schools, finding that class size reduction substantially increase test scores for 4th and 5th graders, albeit not for 3rd graders.[28] In further research at Israeli schools, they find that teacher training can cost-effectively improve students' test scores (at least in secular schools),[29] that computer-aided instruction doesn't [30] and that cash incentives raised high school achievement among girls (by inducing them to increase time invested into exam preparation) but were ineffective for boys.[31] Similarly, in a study by Angrist, Philip Oreopoulos and Daniel Lang comparing the impact of academic support services, financial incentives and a combination of both on Canadian college first-year students, the combined treatment raised the grades of women throughout their first and second years but had no impact on men.[32] In research on school vouchers for private schools in Colombia with Eric Bettinger, Erik Bloom, Elizabeth King and Michael Kremer, Angrist found voucher recipients 10 pp more likely to finish lower secondary school, 5-7 pp more likely to complete high school, and to score 0.2 standard deviations higher on tests, suggesting that the vouchers' benefits likely exceeded their $24 cost.[33][34] Another subject of Angrist's research are peer effects in education,[35] which he has e.g. explored with Kevin Lang in the context of METCO's school integrations or with Atila Abdulkadiroglu and Parag Pathak in Boston's and New York City's over-subscribed exam schools, though the effects that they find are brief and modest in both cases.[36][37] With regard to the effect of teacher testing, which Angrist has studied with Jonathan Guryan in the U.S., he finds that state-mandated teacher testing raises teachers' wages without raising their quality, though it decreases teacher diversity by reducing the fraction of new teachers who are Hispanic.[38] In work with Lavy and Analia Schlosser, Angrist has also explored Becker's hypothesis on a trade-off between child quality and quantity by exploiting variation in twin births and parental preferences for compositions of siblings of mixed sexes, with evidence rejecting the hypothesis.[39]\n\n\n\n##### Research on charter schools[edit]\n\n\nSince the late 2000s, Angrist has conducted extensive research on charter schools in the U.S. with Pathak, Abdulkadiroglu, Susan Dynarski, Thomas Kane, and Christopher Walters. For instance, studying the KIPP Lynn Academy, they estimate that KIPP Lynn attendance increased students' math scores by 0.35 SD and their English scores by 0.12 SD,[40] with most of the gains accruing to students with limited English proficiency or special education needs or those who scored low at baseline.[41] Beyond KIPP Lynn, they find attendance to Boston charter schools to generally increase test scores for middle and high school students, especially for schools with binding assignment lotteries, whereas pilot schools (public schools covered by some collective bargaining provisions and more independence concerning educational policies) generally have at best statistically insignificant or small effects on students' test scores.[42] Further research has attributed the relative efficacy of urban charter schools to these schools' embrace of the No Excuses approach to urban education which emphasizes student discipline and behaviour, traditional reading and math skills, instruction time, and selective teacher hiring.[43]\n\n\n\n### Labor economics[edit]\n\n\nSimilar to his research on the economics of education, Angrist's research on labor economics also often seeks to exploit quasi-natural experiments to identify causal relationships. In a publication derived from his dissertation, Angrist e.g. exploits the military draft lottery during the Vietnam War to estimate that fighting in Vietnam reduced veterans' lifetime earnings by about 15% relative to those of nonveterans.[44] Taking into account veterans' benefits that subsidized education and training (e.g. through the G.I. Bill), he finds that these benefits raised schooling in the U.S. by ca. 1.4 years and veterans' earnings by 6%.[45] In further work exploiting the idiosyncrasies of U.S. military recruitment, Angrist studies the labor market impact of voluntary military service in the 1980s, estimating that voluntary soldiers serving in the 1980s earned considerably more than comparable civilians while serving and experienced comparatively higher employment rates thereafter, even though it raised their long-run civilian earnings at best modestly and - for whites - reduced them.[46] Together with Krueger, Angrist also investigated with Krueger whether U.S. World War II veterans earned more than nonveterans, finding instead that they earned at most as much as comparable nonveterans.[47] Angrist and Krueger later on summarized their work on causality in labor economics in a chapter of the *Handbook of Labor Economics*, with special emphasis on controls for confounding variables, fixed effects models and difference-in-differences, instrumental variables estimation and regression discontinuity designs.[48] In another study related to the U.S. military, Angrist and John H. Johnson IV use the Gulf War to estimate the effects of work-related separations on military families, showing large differences between the impact of male and female soldiers' deployment on divorce rates and spousal labor supply.[49] In work with William Evans, Angrist exploited families' preference for having siblings of mixed sex to estimate children's impact on parental labor supply, observing that family size had no impact on husbands' labor supply and that the impact on women was being overestimated through OLS.[50] In further work with Evans, he also explored the impact of the 1970 state abortion reforms on schooling and labor market outcomes, arguing that they reduced Afro-American teen fertility and thereby raised black women's rates of high school completion, college attendance and employment.[51] In another study with Acemoglu, Angrist has also analysed the consequences of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), finding a sharp drop in employment of persons with disabilities (PwDs) shortly after its inception, thus suggesting that ADA has likely hurt PwDs' labor market outcomes.[52] Angrist has also studied the U.S. marriage market, finding—by exploiting endogamy in marriages—that high male-female sex ratios increased the likelihood of female marriage and decreased their labor force participation.[53] Together with Adriana Kugler, Angrist finds that labor market institutions that reduce labor market flexibility exacerbate native job losses from immigration, especially regarding restricted product markets.[54] Angrist and Kugler also investigated the relationship between coca prices and civil conflict in Colombia, observing that financial opportunities offered by coca cultivation fueled the conflict, with cultivated rural areas witnessing pronounced increases in violence.[55]\n\n\n\n### Econometrics[edit]\n\n\nBesides his empirical research, Angrist has also made major contributions to econometrics, especially concerning the use of instrumental variables estimations. For instance, Angrist developed a two-stage least squares (2SLS) equivalent of the efficient Wald estimator.[56] Together with Guido Imbens, he developed the concept of local average treatment effects and showed how to identify and to estimate them,[57] and how to use 2SLS to estimate the average causal effect of variable treatments.[58] In further work with Imbens and Donald Rubin, Angrist then showed how instrumental variables can be embedded within the Rubin causal model in order to identify causal effects between variables.[59] Angrist also developed with Imbens and Krueger so-called \"jackknife instrumental variables estimators\" to address the bias in 2SLS estimates in over-identified models[60] and has explored the interpretation of IV estimators in simultaneous equations models along with Imbens and Kathryn Graddy.[61] Again with Imbens, along with Alberto Abadie, he has also studied the effect of subsidized training due to the Job Training Partnership Act of 1982 on the quantiles of trainee earnings, finding large effects of JTPA on low-wage female workers but significant effects on men only for the upper half of the male trainee earnings distribution.[62] With regard to limited dependent variable models with binary endogenous regressors, Angrist argues in favour of using 2SLS, multiplicative models for conditional means, linear approximation of non-linear causal models, models for distribution effects, and quantile regression with an endogenous binary regressor.[63] Angrist has also explored the link between local average treatment effects and population average treatment effects, i.e., the external validity of IV estimates.[64] Finally, along with Victor Chernozhukov and Iván Fernández-Val, Angrist has also explored quantile regressions, showing that they minimize a weighted MSE loss function for specification error.[65]\n\n\nIn articles with Krueger as well as with Jorn-Steffen Pischke in the *Journal of Economic Perspectives*, Angrist has repeatedly made the case for a focus on the identification of causality in economics, e.g. using instrumental variables;[66] in particular, Angrist has argued in 2010 in response to Edward Leamer's 1983 critique of econometrics that microeconomics had experienced since then a \"credibility revolution\" thanks to substantial improvements in empirical research designs and renewed attention to causal relationships.[67]\n\n\n\n## Honors and awards[edit]\n\n\nAngrist is a Research Fellow at the Institute for the Study of Labor (IZA). He is also a fellow of the Econometric Society. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2006.[68] In 2007 Angrist received an honorary doctorate in Economics from the University of St. Gallen. He is the recipient of the 2011 John von Neumann Award given annually by the Rajk László College for Advanced Studies in Budapest.\n\n\nAngrist, along with Guido Imbens, won the 2021 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics.[69] The two men received one-half of the prize money of 10 million Swedish crowns ($1.14 million U.S.); the rest went to the other winner, David Card.[70] The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences wrote that:\n\n\n\n\n> \n> Data from a natural experiment are difficult to interpret . . . . For example, extending compulsory education by \n> a year for one group of students (but not another) will not affect everyone in that group in the same way. Some students would have kept studying anyway and, for them, the value of education is often not representative of the entire group. So, is it even possible to draw any conclusions about the effect of an extra year in school? In the mid-1990s, Joshua Angrist and Guido Imbens solved this methodological problem, demonstrating how precise conclusions about cause and effect can be drawn from natural experiments.[3]\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Quasi-natural experiment\n* List of Jewish Nobel laureates\n* List of Israeli Nobel laureates\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Angrist, Joshua David - Full record view - Libraries Australia Search\".\n2. **^** \"MIT Economics: Joshua Angrist\".

He holds the Applied Econometrics Professorship in Economics at the Stanford Graduate School of Business at Stanford University, where he has taught since 2012.[1]\n\n\nIn 2021, Imbens was awarded half of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences jointly with Joshua Angrist \"for their methodological contributions to the analysis of causal relationships.\"[2][3] Their work focused on natural experiments, which can offer empirical data in contexts where controlled experimentation may be expensive, time-consuming, or unethical.[4] In 1994 Imbens and Angrist introduced the local average treatment effect (LATE) framework, an influential mathematical methodology for reliably inferring causation from natural experiments that accounted for and defined the limitations of such inferences.[5][6][7] Imbens' work with Angrist, together with the work of Alan Krueger and co-recipient of the prize David Card is credited with catalysing the \"credibility revolution\" in empirical microeconomics.[6][8]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nGuido Wilhelmus Imbens was born on 3 September 1963 in Geldrop, the Netherlands.[9][10] As a child, Imbens was an avid chess player.[11] In a 2021 interview, Imbens connected his passion for econometrics to his childhood interest in the game.[12]\n\n\nIn high school Imbens was introduced to the work of Dutch economist Jan Tinbergen. Influenced by Tinbergen's work, Imbens chose to study econometrics at Erasmus University Rotterdam, where Tinbergen had taught and established a program in econometrics.[13] Imbens graduated with a Candidate's degree in Econometrics from Erasmus University Rotterdam in 1983. He subsequently obtained an M.Sc. degree *with distinction* in Economics and Econometrics from the University of Hull in Kingston upon Hull, UK in 1986.[1]\n\n\nIn 1986, one of Imbens' mentors at the University of Hull, Anthony Lancaster, moved to Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. Imbens followed Lancaster to Brown to pursue further graduate and doctoral studies.[14] Imbens received an A.M. and a Ph.D. degree in Economics from Brown in 1989 and 1991, respectively.[15][1][16]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Department of Economics at Brown University\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nImbens has taught at Tilburg University (1989-1990), Harvard University (1990–97, 2007–12), the University of California, Los Angeles (1997–2001), and the University of California, Berkeley (2001–07). He specializes in econometrics, which are particular methods for drawing causal inference.[1] He became the editor of *Econometrica* in 2019, with his term anticipated (as of 2022) to end in 2025.[17] As of 2021, he is a professor of applied econometrics and economics at Stanford Graduate School of Business. He is also a senior fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research (SIEPR) and a professor of economics at the institute's School of Humanities and Sciences.[18]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Stanford Graduate School of Business, where Imbens has taught since 2012\nImbens is a fellow of the Econometric Society (2001) and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2009).[1][19][20] Imbens was elected to the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences as a foreign member in 2017.[21][22] He was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association in 2020.[23]\n\n\n\n### Econometrics and work on causal relationships[edit]\n\n\nWorking with fellow economists including Joshua Angrist and Alan Krueger, Imbens focused on developing methodologies and frameworks that help economists use a kind of real-life situations known as natural experiments to test hypotheses about causal relationships, such as the impact of additional years of school education on earnings.[24] His frameworks for causal relationships study found use in multiple other fields including social and biomedical sciences.[25] It provided researchers with tools to understand the limitations of real-world experiments, improving their ability to better understand the effects of field and experimental data based interventions.[18]\n\n\nIn one of his earliest collaborations with Angrist, Imbens introduced a concept called Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) to draw causal inference from observational data. In a 1994 *Econometrica* paper titled \"Identification and Estimation of Local Average Treatment Effects\", the pair employed the idea of natural experiments, where one studies the effects of key changes by using chance and randomization that naturally occur in the real world, instead of controlled conditions, which can be expensive, time-consuming, or even unethical.[5][18] The paper and the model had significant impact on other research efforts across econometrics, statistics and other fields.[6][8]\n\n\nIn one of the real-world applications of the model that would have implications for policymakers, Imbens partnered with statistician Donald Rubin and economist Bruce Sacerdote to study the impact of unearned earnings on labor supply. The group studied the implications of policy interventions such as Universal Basic Income or other federal and state wage assistance programs on citizens' willingness to participate in the labor force and the eventual impact on labor supply.[26] To devise a natural experiment, the group studied the winners of the Massachusetts state lottery where the winners were paid incrementally over many years as opposed to a lump-sum payment. In doing so, the group was able to study the causal effects of guaranteed income. They found that winning the lottery had only a small impact on how much people worked. Winners of $80,000 a year for 20 years reduced their working hours somewhat, but winners of $15,000 a year for 20 years did not. Among unemployed persons who played the lottery, winners worked more than non-winners in the six years after playing.[18][27]\n\n\nSome of Imbens' work was summarized in a 2015 book co-written with American statistician Donald B. Rubin, *Causal Inference for Statistics, Social, and Biomedical Sciences.[25]*\n\n\nAround 2016, he (along with his wife Susan Athey) worked on using machine learning methods, particularly modifications to random forests called causal forests, to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects in causal inference models.[28][29]\n\n\n\n### Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Imbens speaking at Brown University in March 2022\nImbens received the 2021 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences along with fellow economists David Card and Joshua Angrist for their contributions toward methodologies for the analysis of causal relationships.[30] In its press release, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences stated that they \"have provided us with new insights about the labour market and shown what conclusions about cause and effect can be drawn from natural experiments. Their approach has spread to other fields and revolutionised empirical research.\"[31]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nImbens has been married to fellow economist Susan Athey since 2002.[32] Athey likewise teaches at the Stanford Graduate School of Business where she holds the Economics of Technology Professorship.[33] The best man at Imbens and Athey's wedding was Joshua Angrist, with whom Imbens would share the Nobel prize 19 years later.[34]\n\n\nHe holds dual citizenship in the United States and the Netherlands.[1]\n\n\n\n## Honors and awards[edit]\n\n\n* Honorary Doctorate, University of St. Gallen, 2014\n* Horace Mann Medal, Brown University Graduate School, 2017[35]\n* Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, 2021\n* Doctorate of Humane Letters, Brown University, 2022[36]\n* Honorary Doctorate, Erasmus University Rotterdam, 2023[37]\n\n\n## Bibliography[edit]\n\n\n* (with Lisa M.

He holds the Applied Econometrics Professorship in Economics at the Stanford Graduate School of Business at Stanford University, where he has taught since 2012.[1]\n\n\nIn 2021, Imbens was awarded half of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences jointly with Joshua Angrist \"for their methodological contributions to the analysis of causal relationships.\"[2][3] Their work focused on natural experiments, which can offer empirical data in contexts where controlled experimentation may be expensive, time-consuming, or unethical.[4] In 1994 Imbens and Angrist introduced the local average treatment effect (LATE) framework, an influential mathematical methodology for reliably inferring causation from natural experiments that accounted for and defined the limitations of such inferences.[5][6][7] Imbens' work with Angrist, together with the work of Alan Krueger and co-recipient of the prize David Card is credited with catalysing the \"credibility revolution\" in empirical microeconomics.[6][8]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nGuido Wilhelmus Imbens was born on 3 September 1963 in Geldrop, the Netherlands.[9][10] As a child, Imbens was an avid chess player.[11] In a 2021 interview, Imbens connected his passion for econometrics to his childhood interest in the game.[12]\n\n\nIn high school Imbens was introduced to the work of Dutch economist Jan Tinbergen. Influenced by Tinbergen's work, Imbens chose to study econometrics at Erasmus University Rotterdam, where Tinbergen had taught and established a program in econometrics.[13] Imbens graduated with a Candidate's degree in Econometrics from Erasmus University Rotterdam in 1983. He subsequently obtained an M.Sc. degree *with distinction* in Economics and Econometrics from the University of Hull in Kingston upon Hull, UK in 1986.[1]\n\n\nIn 1986, one of Imbens' mentors at the University of Hull, Anthony Lancaster, moved to Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. Imbens followed Lancaster to Brown to pursue further graduate and doctoral studies.[14] Imbens received an A.M. and a Ph.D. degree in Economics from Brown in 1989 and 1991, respectively.[15][1][16]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Department of Economics at Brown University\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nImbens has taught at Tilburg University (1989-1990), Harvard University (1990–97, 2007–12), the University of California, Los Angeles (1997–2001), and the University of California, Berkeley (2001–07). He specializes in econometrics, which are particular methods for drawing causal inference.[1] He became the editor of *Econometrica* in 2019, with his term anticipated (as of 2022) to end in 2025.[17] As of 2021, he is a professor of applied econometrics and economics at Stanford Graduate School of Business. He is also a senior fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research (SIEPR) and a professor of economics at the institute's School of Humanities and Sciences.[18]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Stanford Graduate School of Business, where Imbens has taught since 2012\nImbens is a fellow of the Econometric Society (2001) and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2009).[1][19][20] Imbens was elected to the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences as a foreign member in 2017.[21][22] He was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association in 2020.[23]\n\n\n\n### Econometrics and work on causal relationships[edit]\n\n\nWorking with fellow economists including Joshua Angrist and Alan Krueger, Imbens focused on developing methodologies and frameworks that help economists use a kind of real-life situations known as natural experiments to test hypotheses about causal relationships, such as the impact of additional years of school education on earnings.[24] His frameworks for causal relationships study found use in multiple other fields including social and biomedical sciences.[25] It provided researchers with tools to understand the limitations of real-world experiments, improving their ability to better understand the effects of field and experimental data based interventions.[18]\n\n\nIn one of his earliest collaborations with Angrist, Imbens introduced a concept called Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) to draw causal inference from observational data. In a 1994 *Econometrica* paper titled \"Identification and Estimation of Local Average Treatment Effects\", the pair employed the idea of natural experiments, where one studies the effects of key changes by using chance and randomization that naturally occur in the real world, instead of controlled conditions, which can be expensive, time-consuming, or even unethical.[5][18] The paper and the model had significant impact on other research efforts across econometrics, statistics and other fields.[6][8]\n\n\nIn one of the real-world applications of the model that would have implications for policymakers, Imbens partnered with statistician Donald Rubin and economist Bruce Sacerdote to study the impact of unearned earnings on labor supply. The group studied the implications of policy interventions such as Universal Basic Income or other federal and state wage assistance programs on citizens' willingness to participate in the labor force and the eventual impact on labor supply.[26] To devise a natural experiment, the group studied the winners of the Massachusetts state lottery where the winners were paid incrementally over many years as opposed to a lump-sum payment. In doing so, the group was able to study the causal effects of guaranteed income. They found that winning the lottery had only a small impact on how much people worked. Winners of $80,000 a year for 20 years reduced their working hours somewhat, but winners of $15,000 a year for 20 years did not. Among unemployed persons who played the lottery, winners worked more than non-winners in the six years after playing.[18][27]\n\n\nSome of Imbens' work was summarized in a 2015 book co-written with American statistician Donald B. Rubin, *Causal Inference for Statistics, Social, and Biomedical Sciences.[25]*\n\n\nAround 2016, he (along with his wife Susan Athey) worked on using machine learning methods, particularly modifications to random forests called causal forests, to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects in causal inference models.[28][29]\n\n\n\n### Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Imbens speaking at Brown University in March 2022\nImbens received the 2021 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences along with fellow economists David Card and Joshua Angrist for their contributions toward methodologies for the analysis of causal relationships.[30] In its press release, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences stated that they \"have provided us with new insights about the labour market and shown what conclusions about cause and effect can be drawn from natural experiments. Their approach has spread to other fields and revolutionised empirical research.\"[31]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nImbens has been married to fellow economist Susan Athey since 2002.[32] Athey likewise teaches at the Stanford Graduate School of Business where she holds the Economics of Technology Professorship.[33] The best man at Imbens and Athey's wedding was Joshua Angrist, with whom Imbens would share the Nobel prize 19 years later.[34]\n\n\nHe holds dual citizenship in the United States and the Netherlands.[1]\n\n\n\n## Honors and awards[edit]\n\n\n* Honorary Doctorate, University of St. Gallen, 2014\n* Horace Mann Medal, Brown University Graduate School, 2017[35]\n* Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, 2021\n* Doctorate of Humane Letters, Brown University, 2022[36]\n* Honorary Doctorate, Erasmus University Rotterdam, 2023[37]\n\n\n## Bibliography[edit]\n\n\n* (with Lisa M.

After leaving the Federal Reserve, he was appointed a distinguished fellow at the Brookings Institution.[3][4] During his tenure as chairman, Bernanke oversaw the Federal Reserve's response to the late-2000s financial crisis, for which he was named the 2009 *Time* Person of the Year.[4] Before becoming Federal Reserve chairman, Bernanke was a tenured professor at Princeton University and chaired the Department of Economics there from 1996 to September 2002, when he went on public service leave.[4] Bernanke was awarded the 2022 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, jointly with Douglas Diamond and Philip H. Dybvig, \"for research on banks and financial crises\",[5][6] more specifically for his analysis of the Great Depression.\n\n\nFrom August 5, 2002, until June 21, 2005, he was a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, proposed the Bernanke doctrine, and first discussed \"the Great Moderation\"—the theory that traditional business cycles have declined in volatility in recent decades through structural changes that have occurred in the international economy, particularly increases in the economic stability of developing nations, diminishing the influence of macroeconomic (monetary and fiscal) policy.\n\n\nBernanke then served as chairman of President George W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers before President Bush nominated him to succeed Alan Greenspan as chairman of the United States Federal Reserve.[7] His first term began on February 1, 2006.[8] Bernanke was confirmed for a second term as chairman on January 28, 2010, after being renominated by President Barack Obama, who later referred to him as \"the epitome of calm.\"[9] His second term ended on January 31, 2014, when he was succeeded by Janet Yellen on February 3, 2014.[10]\n\n\nBernanke wrote about his time as chairman of the Federal Reserve in his 2015 book, *The Courage to Act*, in which he revealed that the world's economy came close to collapse in 2007 and 2008. Bernanke asserts that it was only the novel efforts of the Fed (cooperating with other US agencies and agencies of other governments) that prevented an economic catastrophe greater than the Great Depression.[11]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and family[edit]\n\n\nBernanke was born in Augusta, Georgia, and was raised on East Jefferson Street in Dillon, South Carolina.[12] His father Philip was a pharmacist and part-time theater manager. His mother Edna was an elementary school teacher.[13] Bernanke has two younger siblings. His brother, Seth, is a lawyer in Charlotte, North Carolina. His sister, Sharon, is a longtime administrator at Berklee College of Music in Boston.\n\n\nThe Bernankes were one of the few Jewish families in Dillon and attended Ohav Shalom, a local synagogue;[14] Bernanke learned Hebrew as a child from his maternal grandfather, Harold Friedman, a professional hazzan (cantor), shochet, and Hebrew teacher.[15][16] Bernanke's father and uncle owned and managed a drugstore they purchased from Bernanke's paternal grandfather, Jonas Bernanke.[12]\n\n\nJonas Bernanke was born in Boryslav, Austria-Hungary (today part of Ukraine), on January 23, 1891. He immigrated to the United States from Przemyśl, Poland, and arrived at Ellis Island, aged 30, on June 30, 1921, with his wife Pauline, aged 25. On the ship's manifest, Jonas's occupation is listed as \"clerk\" and Pauline's as \"doctor med\".[17][18]\n\n\nThe family moved to Dillon from New York in the 1940s.[19] Bernanke's mother gave up her job as a schoolteacher when her son was born and worked at the family drugstore. Ben Bernanke also worked there sometimes.[14]\n\n\n\n### Young adult[edit]\n\n\nAs a teenager, Bernanke worked construction on a hospital and waited tables at a restaurant at nearby South of the Border, which was a roadside attraction, amusement park, and fireworks retailer near his hometown in Hamer, South Carolina, before leaving for college.[12][20][21] To support himself throughout college, he continued to work during the summers at South of the Border.[12][22]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nAs a teenager in the 1960s, Bernanke helped roll the Torah scrolls in his local synagogue.[23] Although he keeps his beliefs private, his friend Mark Gertler, chairman of New York University's economics department, says they are \"embedded in who he (Bernanke) is.\"[24] Once Bernanke was at Harvard for his freshman year, fellow Dillon native Kenneth Manning took him to Brookline for Rosh Hashanah services.[25]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nBernanke was educated at East Elementary, J.V. Martin Junior High, and Dillon High School, where he was class valedictorian and played saxophone in the marching band.[26] Since Dillon High School did not offer calculus at the time, Bernanke taught it to himself.[27][28] Bernanke scored 1590 out of 1600 on the SAT[27][29] and was a National Merit Scholar.[30] He also was a contestant in the 1965 National Spelling Bee.[31][32]\n\n\nBernanke entered Harvard College in 1971,[33] where he lived in Winthrop House, as did the future chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs, Lloyd Blankfein, and graduated Phi Beta Kappa with an A.B. degree, and later with an A.M. in economics *summa cum laude* in 1975. He received a Ph.D. degree in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1979 after completing and defending his dissertation, *Long-Term Commitments, Dynamic Optimization, and the Business Cycle*. Bernanke's thesis adviser was the future governor of the Bank of Israel, Stanley Fischer, and his readers included Irwin S. Bernstein, Rüdiger Dornbusch, Robert Solow, and Peter Diamond of MIT and Dale Jorgenson of Harvard.[34]\n\n\n\n## Academic and government career (1979–2006)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bernanke meeting with United States President Barack Obama.\nBernanke taught at the Stanford Graduate School of Business from 1979 until 1985, was a visiting professor at New York University and went on to become a tenured professor at Princeton University in the Department of Economics. He chaired that department from 1996 until September 2002, when he went on public service leave. He resigned his position at Princeton July 1, 2005.\n\n\nBernanke served as a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System from 2002 to 2005. In one of his first speeches as a governor, entitled \"Deflation: Making Sure It Doesn't Happen Here\", he outlined what has been referred to as the Bernanke doctrine.[35]\n\n\nAs a member of the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System on February 20, 2004, Bernanke gave a speech in which he postulated that we are in a new era called the Great Moderation, where modern macroeconomic policy has decreased the volatility of the business cycle to the point that it should no longer be a central issue in economics.[36]\n\n\nIn June 2005, Bernanke was named chairman of President George W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers and resigned as Fed governor. The appointment was largely viewed as a test run to ascertain if Bernanke could be Bush's pick to succeed Greenspan as Fed chairman the next year.[37] He held the post until January 2006.\n\n\n\n## Chairman of the United States Federal Reserve[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bernanke testifying before the House Financial Services Committee responding to a question on February 10, 2009.\nOn February 1, 2006, Bernanke began a fourteen-year term as a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and a four-year term as chairman (after having been nominated by President Bush in late 2005).[37][38] By virtue of the chairmanship, he sat on the Financial Stability Oversight Board that oversees the Troubled Asset Relief Program. He also served as chairman of the Federal Open Market Committee, the System's principal monetary policy making body.\n\n\nHis first months as chairman of the Federal Reserve System were marked by difficulties communicating with the media. An advocate of more transparent Fed policy and clearer statements than Greenspan had made, he had to back away from his initial idea of stating clearer inflation goals as such statements tended to affect the stock market.[39] Maria Bartiromo disclosed on CNBC comments from their private conversation at the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner.[40] She reported that Bernanke said investors had misinterpreted his comments as indicating that he was \"dovish\" on inflation. He was sharply criticized for making public statements about Fed direction, which he said was a \"lapse in judgment.\"\n\n\n\n### Financial crisis of 2007–2008[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bernanke (left) in September 2008 as President Bush speaks about the economyFurther information: Financial crisis of 2007–2008\n\nAs the Great Recession deepened, Bernanke oversaw some unorthodox measures. Under his guidance, the Fed lowered its funds interest rate from 5.25% to 0.0% within less than a year. When this was considered insufficient to abate the liquidity crisis, the Fed initiated quantitative easing, creating $1.3 trillion from November 2008 to June 2010 and using the created money to buy financial assets from banks and from the government.\n\n\n\n### Second term[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bernanke answers questions in 2013 at FOMC press conference\nOn August 25, 2009, President Obama announced he would nominate Bernanke to a second term as chairman of the Federal Reserve.[41] In a short statement on Martha's Vineyard, with Bernanke standing at his side, Obama said Bernanke's background, temperament, courage and creativity helped to prevent another Great Depression in 2008.[42] When Senate Banking Committee hearings on his nomination began on December 3, 2009, several senators from both parties indicated they would not support a second term.[43][44][45][46][47][48]\n\n\nHowever, Bernanke was confirmed for a second term as chairman on January 28, 2010, by a 70–30 vote of the full Senate,[49] the narrowest margin, at the time, for any occupant of the position.[50] (For the roll-call vote, see Obama confirmations, 2010.) The Senate first voted 77–23 to end debate, Bernanke winning more than the 60 approval votes needed to overcome the possibility of a filibuster.[51] On a second vote to confirm, the 30 dissents came from 11 Democrats, 18 Republicans and one independent.[51]\n\n\nBernanke was succeeded as chair of the Federal Reserve by Janet Yellen, the first woman to hold the position. Yellen was nominated on October 9, 2013, by President Obama and confirmed by the United States Senate on January 6, 2014.[52]\n\n\n\n## Controversies as Federal Reserve Chairman[edit]\n\n\nBernanke has been subjected to criticism concerning the late-2000s financial crisis. According to *The New York Times*, Bernanke \"has been attacked for failing to foresee the financial crisis, for bailing out Wall Street, and, most recently, for injecting an additional $600 billion into the banking system to give the slow recovery a boost.\"[53]\n\n\n\n### Merrill Lynch merger with Bank of America[edit]\n\n\nIn a letter to Congress from then-New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo dated April 23, 2009, Bernanke was mentioned along with former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson in allegations of fraud concerning the acquisition of Merrill Lynch by Bank of America. The letter alleged that the extent of the losses at Merrill Lynch was not disclosed to Bank of America by Bernanke and Paulson. When Ken Lewis, the chief executive officer of Bank of America, informed Paulson that Bank of America was exiting the merger by invoking the \"Material Adverse Change\" (MAC) clause, Paulson immediately called Lewis to a meeting in Washington. At the meeting, which allegedly took place on December 21, 2008, Paulson told Lewis that he and the board would be replaced if they invoked the MAC clause and additionally not to reveal the extent of the losses to shareholders. Paulson stated to Cuomo's office that he was directed by Bernanke to threaten Lewis in this manner.[54]\n\n\nCongressional hearings into these allegations were conducted on June 25, 2009, with Bernanke testifying that he did not bully Lewis. Under intense questioning by members of Congress, Bernanke said, \"I never said anything about firing the board and the management [of Bank of America].\" In further testimony, Bernanke said the Fed did nothing illegal or unethical in its efforts to convince Bank of America not to end the merger. Lewis told the panel that authorities expressed \"strong views\" but said he would not characterize their stance as improper.[55]\n\n\n\n### AIG bailout[edit]\n\n\nAccording to a January 26, 2010, column in *The Huffington Post*, a whistleblower has disclosed documents providing \"'troubling details' of Bernanke's role in the AIG bailout\". Republican Senator Jim Bunning of Kentucky said on CNBC that he had seen documents which show that Bernanke overruled recommendations from his staff in bailing out AIG. The columnist says this raises questions as to whether or not the decision to bail out AIG was necessary. Senators from both parties who support Bernanke say his actions averted worse problems and outweighed whatever responsibility this may have created for the financial crisis.[56]\n\n\n\n### Edward Quince[edit]\n\n\nThe crisis in 2008 also made Ben Bernanke create a pseudonym, Edward Quince. According to the Wall Street Journal, the false name was evidence in a class-action lawsuit against the government by shareholders of AIG, which had been given a Fed-backed bailout when it was near collapse. One of Mr. Quince's emails reads, \"We think they are days from failure. They think it is a temporary problem. This disconnect is dangerous.\"[57]\n\n\nUpon the revelation of the Quince pseudonym during the Starr v. United States trial, *The New York Times* created a cocktail inspired by Mr. Bernanke's chosen alias: the \"Rye & Quince.\"[58]\n\n\n\n## Economic views[edit]\n\n\n![](image)With his predecessor, Alan Greenspan, looking on, Chairman Ben Bernanke addresses President George W. Bush and others after being sworn into the Federal Reserve post. Also on stage with the President are Mrs. Anna Bernanke and Roger W. Ferguson Jr., Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve.\nBernanke has given several lectures at the London School of Economics on monetary theory and policy. He has written two textbooks: an intermediate-level macroeconomics textbook coauthored with Andrew Abel (and also Dean Croushore in later editions) and an introductory textbook, covering both microeconomics and macroeconomics, coauthored with Robert H. Frank. Bernanke was the Director of the Monetary Economics Program of the National Bureau of Economic Research and the editor of the American Economic Review. He is among the 50 most published economists in the world according to IDEAS/RePEc.[59]\n\n\nBernanke is particularly interested in the economic and political causes of the Great Depression, on which he has published numerous academic journal articles. Before Bernanke's work, the dominant monetarist theory of the Great Depression was Milton Friedman's view that it had been largely caused by the Federal Reserve's having reduced the money supply and has on several occasions argued that one of the biggest mistakes made during the period was to raise interest rates too early.[60] In a speech on Milton Friedman's ninetieth birthday (November 8, 2002), Bernanke said:\n\n\n\n\n> \"Let me end my talk by abusing slightly my status as an official representative of the Federal Reserve. I would like to say to Milton and Anna [Schwartz, Friedman's coauthor]: Regarding the Great Depression, you're right. We did it. We're very sorry. But thanks to you, we won't do it again.\"[61][62]\n> \n> \n\n\nBernanke has cited Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz in his decision to lower interest rates to zero.[63] Anna Schwartz, however, was highly critical of Bernanke and wrote an opinion piece in *The New York Times* advising Obama against his reappointment as chairman of the Federal Reserve.[64] Bernanke focused less on the role of the Federal Reserve and more on the role of private banks and financial institutions.[65]\n\n\nBernanke found that the financial disruptions of 1930–33 reduced the efficiency of the credit allocation process; and that the resulting higher cost and reduced availability of credit acted to depress aggregate demand, identifying an effect he called the financial accelerator. When faced with a mild downturn, banks are likely to significantly cut back lending and other risky ventures. This further hurts the economy, creating a vicious cycle and potentially turning a mild recession into a major depression.[66] Economist Brad DeLong, who had previously advocated his own theory for the Great Depression, notes that the global financial crisis of 2008–2009 has raised the pertinence of Bernanke's theory.[67]\n\n\nIn 2002, following coverage of concerns about deflation in the business news, Bernanke gave a speech about the topic.[68] In that speech, he mentioned that the government in a fiat money system owns the physical means of creating money and to maintain market liquidity. Control of the money supply implies that the government can always avoid deflation by simply issuing more money. He said, \"The U.S. government has a technology, called a printing press (or today, its electronic equivalent), that allows it to produce as many U.S. dollars as it wishes at no cost.\"[68]\n\n\nHe referred to a statement made by Milton Friedman about using a \"helicopter drop\" of money into the economy to fight deflation. Bernanke's critics have since referred to him as \"Helicopter Ben\" or to his \"helicopter printing press.\" In a footnote to his speech, Bernanke noted that \"people know that inflation erodes the real value of the government's debt and, therefore, that it is in the interest of the government to create some inflation.\"[68]\n\n\nFor example, while Greenspan publicly supported President Clinton's deficit reduction plan and the Bush tax cuts, Bernanke, when questioned about taxation policy, said that it was none of his business, his exclusive remit being monetary policy, and said that fiscal policy and wider society related issues were what politicians were for and got elected for. But Bernanke has been identified by *The Wall Street Journal* and a close colleague as a \"libertarian-Republican\" in the mold of Alan Greenspan.[63]\n\n\nIn 2005 Bernanke coined the term saving glut, the idea that relatively high level of worldwide savings was holding down interest rates and financing the current account deficits of the United States. (Alternative reasons include relatively low worldwide investment coupled with low U.S. savings.)[69]\n\n\nAs the recession began in 2007, many economists urged Bernanke (and the rest of the Federal Open Market Committee) to lower the federal funds rate below what it had done. For example, Larry Summers, later named Director of the White House's National Economic Council under President Obama, wrote in the *Financial Times* on November 26, 2007—in a column in which he argued that recession was likely—that \"maintaining demand must be the over-arching macro-economic priority. That means the Federal Reserve System has to get ahead of the curve and recognize—as the market already has—that levels of the Federal Funds rate that were neutral when the financial system was working normally are quite contractionary today.\"[70]\n\n\nDavid Leonhardt of *The New York Times* wrote, on January 30, 2008, that \"Dr. Bernanke's forecasts have been too sunny over the last six months. [On] the other hand, his forecast was a lot better than Wall Street's in mid-2006. Back then, he resisted calls for further interest rate increases because he thought the economy might be weakening.\"[71]\n\n\n\n## After the Federal Reserve[edit]\n\n\n![](image)From left to right: Janet Yellen, Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke, and Paul Volcker, May 1, 2014.\nIn a speech at the American Economics Association conference in January 2014, Bernanke reflected on his tenure as chairman of the Federal Reserve. He expressed his hope that economic growth was building momentum and stated that he was confident that the central bank would be able to withdraw its support smoothly.[72]\n\n\nIn an October 2014 speech, Bernanke disclosed that he was unsuccessful in efforts to refinance his home. He suggested that lenders \"may have gone a little bit too far on mortgage credit conditions\".[73]\n\n\nSince February 2014, Bernanke has been employed as a Distinguished Fellow in Residence with the Economic Studies Program at the Brookings Institution.[74]\n\n\nOn April 16, 2015, it was announced publicly that Bernanke will work with Citadel, the $25 billion hedge fund founded by billionaire Kenneth C. Griffin, as a senior adviser.[75] In the same month it was revealed that Bernanke would also join PIMCO as a senior advisor.[76]\n\n\nIn his 2015 book, *The Courage to Act*, Bernanke revealed that he was no longer a Republican, having \"lost patience with Republicans' susceptibility to the know-nothing-ism of the far right. ... I view myself now as a moderate independent, and I think that's where I'll stay.\"[77]\n\n\nBernanke published in 2022 his latest book titled *21st Century Monetary Policy: The Federal Reserve from the Great Inflation to COVID-19,* where he assesses the successes as well as failures of the Federal Reserve since its inception. The book received a positive review from the New York Times saying the \"book is intended to help future generations of economic policymakers, and it probably will.\"[78]\n\n\n\n## Statements on deficit reduction and reform of Social Security/Medicare[edit]\n\n\nBernanke favors reducing the U.S. budget deficit, particularly by reforming the Social Security and Medicare entitlement programs. During a speech delivered on April 7, 2010, he warned that the U.S. must soon develop a \"credible\" plan to address the pending funding crisis faced by \"entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare\" or \"in the longer run we will have neither financial stability nor healthy economic growth.\"[79][80] Bernanke said that formulation of such a plan would help the economy in the near term, even if actual implementation of the plan might have to wait until the economic outlook improves.[81]\n\n\nHis remarks were most likely intended for the federal government's executive and legislative branches,[82] since entitlement reform is a fiscal exercise that will be accomplished by the Congress and the President[83][84] rather than a monetary task falling within the implementation powers of the Federal Reserve. Bernanke also pointed out that deficit reduction will necessarily consist of either raising taxes, cutting entitlement payments and other government spending, or some combination of both.[85]\n\n\n\n## Nobel Prize[edit]\n\n\nIn 2022 Bernanke was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences along with Philip H. Dybvig and Douglas Diamond. Their research suggested that the Great Depression was caused by a variety of factors including credit market stress and a failing gold standard. With a rising External Finance Premium lenders and borrowers were both inclined to protect their financial health due to stressed credit markets. Lenders began tightening credit standards and avoiding risky borrowers while borrowers withdrew their cash. These self-preservation decisions from both lenders and borrowers resulted in further stress on the credit market and stagnation in investment spending. In addition to stressed credit markets, the failing gold standard also played a crucial role. After World War 1 most countries had their currencies tied to gold as well as fixed exchange rates, however, post-war animosity between many European nations led to non-cooperation regarding the gold standard. Consequently, the gold standard failed in the late 1920s, bringing prices, money supply, and output down with it. Their research showed that the combination of a failing gold standard and stressed credit markets led to a catastrophic spiral in the economy.[86]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ben and Anna Bernanke\nBernanke met his wife, Anna, a schoolteacher, on a blind date. The Bernankes have two children, Joel and Alyssa.[87] He is an ardent fan of the Washington Nationals baseball team, and frequently attends games at Nationals Park.[88]\n\n\nWhen Bernanke left Stanford to accept a position at Princeton, he and his family moved to Montgomery Township, New Jersey, in 1985, where Bernanke's children attended the local public schools.[89] Bernanke served for six years as a member of the board of education of the Montgomery Township School District.[89]\n\n\n\nIn 2009, *The Wall Street Journal* reported that Bernanke was a victim of identity theft, a spreading crime the Federal Reserve has for years issued warnings about.[90]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\n* Fellow of the Econometric Society (1997)\n* Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2001)[91]\n* Order of the Palmetto (2006)[14]\n* Member of the American Philosophical Society (2006)[92]\n* Distinguished Leadership in Government Award, Columbia Business School (2008)[93]\n* In 2009, the South Carolina Department of Transportation (SCDOT) Commission approved a resolution on February 21 to name Exit 190 along Interstate Highway 95 in Dillon County the *Ben Bernanke Interchange*.[94]\n* In 2009, he was named the *Time* magazine person of the year.[95]\n* In 2020 he was awarded the BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in the category \"Economics, Finance and Management\".[96]\n* Member of the National Academy of Sciences (2021)[97]\n* Along with Douglas W.

After leaving the Federal Reserve, he was appointed a distinguished fellow at the Brookings Institution.[3][4] During his tenure as chairman, Bernanke oversaw the Federal Reserve's response to the late-2000s financial crisis, for which he was named the 2009 *Time* Person of the Year.[4] Before becoming Federal Reserve chairman, Bernanke was a tenured professor at Princeton University and chaired the Department of Economics there from 1996 to September 2002, when he went on public service leave.[4] Bernanke was awarded the 2022 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, jointly with Douglas Diamond and Philip H. Dybvig, \"for research on banks and financial crises\",[5][6] more specifically for his analysis of the Great Depression.\n\n\nFrom August 5, 2002, until June 21, 2005, he was a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, proposed the Bernanke doctrine, and first discussed \"the Great Moderation\"—the theory that traditional business cycles have declined in volatility in recent decades through structural changes that have occurred in the international economy, particularly increases in the economic stability of developing nations, diminishing the influence of macroeconomic (monetary and fiscal) policy.\n\n\nBernanke then served as chairman of President George W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers before President Bush nominated him to succeed Alan Greenspan as chairman of the United States Federal Reserve.[7] His first term began on February 1, 2006.[8] Bernanke was confirmed for a second term as chairman on January 28, 2010, after being renominated by President Barack Obama, who later referred to him as \"the epitome of calm.\"[9] His second term ended on January 31, 2014, when he was succeeded by Janet Yellen on February 3, 2014.[10]\n\n\nBernanke wrote about his time as chairman of the Federal Reserve in his 2015 book, *The Courage to Act*, in which he revealed that the world's economy came close to collapse in 2007 and 2008. Bernanke asserts that it was only the novel efforts of the Fed (cooperating with other US agencies and agencies of other governments) that prevented an economic catastrophe greater than the Great Depression.[11]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and family[edit]\n\n\nBernanke was born in Augusta, Georgia, and was raised on East Jefferson Street in Dillon, South Carolina.[12] His father Philip was a pharmacist and part-time theater manager. His mother Edna was an elementary school teacher.[13] Bernanke has two younger siblings. His brother, Seth, is a lawyer in Charlotte, North Carolina. His sister, Sharon, is a longtime administrator at Berklee College of Music in Boston.\n\n\nThe Bernankes were one of the few Jewish families in Dillon and attended Ohav Shalom, a local synagogue;[14] Bernanke learned Hebrew as a child from his maternal grandfather, Harold Friedman, a professional hazzan (cantor), shochet, and Hebrew teacher.[15][16] Bernanke's father and uncle owned and managed a drugstore they purchased from Bernanke's paternal grandfather, Jonas Bernanke.[12]\n\n\nJonas Bernanke was born in Boryslav, Austria-Hungary (today part of Ukraine), on January 23, 1891. He immigrated to the United States from Przemyśl, Poland, and arrived at Ellis Island, aged 30, on June 30, 1921, with his wife Pauline, aged 25. On the ship's manifest, Jonas's occupation is listed as \"clerk\" and Pauline's as \"doctor med\".[17][18]\n\n\nThe family moved to Dillon from New York in the 1940s.[19] Bernanke's mother gave up her job as a schoolteacher when her son was born and worked at the family drugstore. Ben Bernanke also worked there sometimes.[14]\n\n\n\n### Young adult[edit]\n\n\nAs a teenager, Bernanke worked construction on a hospital and waited tables at a restaurant at nearby South of the Border, which was a roadside attraction, amusement park, and fireworks retailer near his hometown in Hamer, South Carolina, before leaving for college.[12][20][21] To support himself throughout college, he continued to work during the summers at South of the Border.[12][22]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nAs a teenager in the 1960s, Bernanke helped roll the Torah scrolls in his local synagogue.[23] Although he keeps his beliefs private, his friend Mark Gertler, chairman of New York University's economics department, says they are \"embedded in who he (Bernanke) is.\"[24] Once Bernanke was at Harvard for his freshman year, fellow Dillon native Kenneth Manning took him to Brookline for Rosh Hashanah services.[25]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nBernanke was educated at East Elementary, J.V. Martin Junior High, and Dillon High School, where he was class valedictorian and played saxophone in the marching band.[26] Since Dillon High School did not offer calculus at the time, Bernanke taught it to himself.[27][28] Bernanke scored 1590 out of 1600 on the SAT[27][29] and was a National Merit Scholar.[30] He also was a contestant in the 1965 National Spelling Bee.[31][32]\n\n\nBernanke entered Harvard College in 1971,[33] where he lived in Winthrop House, as did the future chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs, Lloyd Blankfein, and graduated Phi Beta Kappa with an A.B. degree, and later with an A.M. in economics *summa cum laude* in 1975. He received a Ph.D. degree in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1979 after completing and defending his dissertation, *Long-Term Commitments, Dynamic Optimization, and the Business Cycle*. Bernanke's thesis adviser was the future governor of the Bank of Israel, Stanley Fischer, and his readers included Irwin S. Bernstein, Rüdiger Dornbusch, Robert Solow, and Peter Diamond of MIT and Dale Jorgenson of Harvard.[34]\n\n\n\n## Academic and government career (1979–2006)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bernanke meeting with United States President Barack Obama.\nBernanke taught at the Stanford Graduate School of Business from 1979 until 1985, was a visiting professor at New York University and went on to become a tenured professor at Princeton University in the Department of Economics. He chaired that department from 1996 until September 2002, when he went on public service leave. He resigned his position at Princeton July 1, 2005.\n\n\nBernanke served as a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System from 2002 to 2005. In one of his first speeches as a governor, entitled \"Deflation: Making Sure It Doesn't Happen Here\", he outlined what has been referred to as the Bernanke doctrine.[35]\n\n\nAs a member of the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System on February 20, 2004, Bernanke gave a speech in which he postulated that we are in a new era called the Great Moderation, where modern macroeconomic policy has decreased the volatility of the business cycle to the point that it should no longer be a central issue in economics.[36]\n\n\nIn June 2005, Bernanke was named chairman of President George W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers and resigned as Fed governor. The appointment was largely viewed as a test run to ascertain if Bernanke could be Bush's pick to succeed Greenspan as Fed chairman the next year.[37] He held the post until January 2006.\n\n\n\n## Chairman of the United States Federal Reserve[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bernanke testifying before the House Financial Services Committee responding to a question on February 10, 2009.\nOn February 1, 2006, Bernanke began a fourteen-year term as a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and a four-year term as chairman (after having been nominated by President Bush in late 2005).[37][38] By virtue of the chairmanship, he sat on the Financial Stability Oversight Board that oversees the Troubled Asset Relief Program. He also served as chairman of the Federal Open Market Committee, the System's principal monetary policy making body.\n\n\nHis first months as chairman of the Federal Reserve System were marked by difficulties communicating with the media. An advocate of more transparent Fed policy and clearer statements than Greenspan had made, he had to back away from his initial idea of stating clearer inflation goals as such statements tended to affect the stock market.[39] Maria Bartiromo disclosed on CNBC comments from their private conversation at the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner.[40] She reported that Bernanke said investors had misinterpreted his comments as indicating that he was \"dovish\" on inflation. He was sharply criticized for making public statements about Fed direction, which he said was a \"lapse in judgment.\"\n\n\n\n### Financial crisis of 2007–2008[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bernanke (left) in September 2008 as President Bush speaks about the economyFurther information: Financial crisis of 2007–2008\n\nAs the Great Recession deepened, Bernanke oversaw some unorthodox measures. Under his guidance, the Fed lowered its funds interest rate from 5.25% to 0.0% within less than a year. When this was considered insufficient to abate the liquidity crisis, the Fed initiated quantitative easing, creating $1.3 trillion from November 2008 to June 2010 and using the created money to buy financial assets from banks and from the government.\n\n\n\n### Second term[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bernanke answers questions in 2013 at FOMC press conference\nOn August 25, 2009, President Obama announced he would nominate Bernanke to a second term as chairman of the Federal Reserve.[41] In a short statement on Martha's Vineyard, with Bernanke standing at his side, Obama said Bernanke's background, temperament, courage and creativity helped to prevent another Great Depression in 2008.[42] When Senate Banking Committee hearings on his nomination began on December 3, 2009, several senators from both parties indicated they would not support a second term.[43][44][45][46][47][48]\n\n\nHowever, Bernanke was confirmed for a second term as chairman on January 28, 2010, by a 70–30 vote of the full Senate,[49] the narrowest margin, at the time, for any occupant of the position.[50] (For the roll-call vote, see Obama confirmations, 2010.) The Senate first voted 77–23 to end debate, Bernanke winning more than the 60 approval votes needed to overcome the possibility of a filibuster.[51] On a second vote to confirm, the 30 dissents came from 11 Democrats, 18 Republicans and one independent.[51]\n\n\nBernanke was succeeded as chair of the Federal Reserve by Janet Yellen, the first woman to hold the position. Yellen was nominated on October 9, 2013, by President Obama and confirmed by the United States Senate on January 6, 2014.[52]\n\n\n\n## Controversies as Federal Reserve Chairman[edit]\n\n\nBernanke has been subjected to criticism concerning the late-2000s financial crisis. According to *The New York Times*, Bernanke \"has been attacked for failing to foresee the financial crisis, for bailing out Wall Street, and, most recently, for injecting an additional $600 billion into the banking system to give the slow recovery a boost.\"[53]\n\n\n\n### Merrill Lynch merger with Bank of America[edit]\n\n\nIn a letter to Congress from then-New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo dated April 23, 2009, Bernanke was mentioned along with former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson in allegations of fraud concerning the acquisition of Merrill Lynch by Bank of America. The letter alleged that the extent of the losses at Merrill Lynch was not disclosed to Bank of America by Bernanke and Paulson. When Ken Lewis, the chief executive officer of Bank of America, informed Paulson that Bank of America was exiting the merger by invoking the \"Material Adverse Change\" (MAC) clause, Paulson immediately called Lewis to a meeting in Washington. At the meeting, which allegedly took place on December 21, 2008, Paulson told Lewis that he and the board would be replaced if they invoked the MAC clause and additionally not to reveal the extent of the losses to shareholders. Paulson stated to Cuomo's office that he was directed by Bernanke to threaten Lewis in this manner.[54]\n\n\nCongressional hearings into these allegations were conducted on June 25, 2009, with Bernanke testifying that he did not bully Lewis. Under intense questioning by members of Congress, Bernanke said, \"I never said anything about firing the board and the management [of Bank of America].\" In further testimony, Bernanke said the Fed did nothing illegal or unethical in its efforts to convince Bank of America not to end the merger. Lewis told the panel that authorities expressed \"strong views\" but said he would not characterize their stance as improper.[55]\n\n\n\n### AIG bailout[edit]\n\n\nAccording to a January 26, 2010, column in *The Huffington Post*, a whistleblower has disclosed documents providing \"'troubling details' of Bernanke's role in the AIG bailout\". Republican Senator Jim Bunning of Kentucky said on CNBC that he had seen documents which show that Bernanke overruled recommendations from his staff in bailing out AIG. The columnist says this raises questions as to whether or not the decision to bail out AIG was necessary. Senators from both parties who support Bernanke say his actions averted worse problems and outweighed whatever responsibility this may have created for the financial crisis.[56]\n\n\n\n### Edward Quince[edit]\n\n\nThe crisis in 2008 also made Ben Bernanke create a pseudonym, Edward Quince. According to the Wall Street Journal, the false name was evidence in a class-action lawsuit against the government by shareholders of AIG, which had been given a Fed-backed bailout when it was near collapse. One of Mr. Quince's emails reads, \"We think they are days from failure. They think it is a temporary problem. This disconnect is dangerous.\"[57]\n\n\nUpon the revelation of the Quince pseudonym during the Starr v. United States trial, *The New York Times* created a cocktail inspired by Mr. Bernanke's chosen alias: the \"Rye & Quince.\"[58]\n\n\n\n## Economic views[edit]\n\n\n![](image)With his predecessor, Alan Greenspan, looking on, Chairman Ben Bernanke addresses President George W. Bush and others after being sworn into the Federal Reserve post. Also on stage with the President are Mrs. Anna Bernanke and Roger W. Ferguson Jr., Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve.\nBernanke has given several lectures at the London School of Economics on monetary theory and policy. He has written two textbooks: an intermediate-level macroeconomics textbook coauthored with Andrew Abel (and also Dean Croushore in later editions) and an introductory textbook, covering both microeconomics and macroeconomics, coauthored with Robert H. Frank. Bernanke was the Director of the Monetary Economics Program of the National Bureau of Economic Research and the editor of the American Economic Review. He is among the 50 most published economists in the world according to IDEAS/RePEc.[59]\n\n\nBernanke is particularly interested in the economic and political causes of the Great Depression, on which he has published numerous academic journal articles. Before Bernanke's work, the dominant monetarist theory of the Great Depression was Milton Friedman's view that it had been largely caused by the Federal Reserve's having reduced the money supply and has on several occasions argued that one of the biggest mistakes made during the period was to raise interest rates too early.[60] In a speech on Milton Friedman's ninetieth birthday (November 8, 2002), Bernanke said:\n\n\n\n\n> \"Let me end my talk by abusing slightly my status as an official representative of the Federal Reserve. I would like to say to Milton and Anna [Schwartz, Friedman's coauthor]: Regarding the Great Depression, you're right. We did it. We're very sorry. But thanks to you, we won't do it again.\"[61][62]\n> \n> \n\n\nBernanke has cited Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz in his decision to lower interest rates to zero.[63] Anna Schwartz, however, was highly critical of Bernanke and wrote an opinion piece in *The New York Times* advising Obama against his reappointment as chairman of the Federal Reserve.[64] Bernanke focused less on the role of the Federal Reserve and more on the role of private banks and financial institutions.[65]\n\n\nBernanke found that the financial disruptions of 1930–33 reduced the efficiency of the credit allocation process; and that the resulting higher cost and reduced availability of credit acted to depress aggregate demand, identifying an effect he called the financial accelerator. When faced with a mild downturn, banks are likely to significantly cut back lending and other risky ventures. This further hurts the economy, creating a vicious cycle and potentially turning a mild recession into a major depression.[66] Economist Brad DeLong, who had previously advocated his own theory for the Great Depression, notes that the global financial crisis of 2008–2009 has raised the pertinence of Bernanke's theory.[67]\n\n\nIn 2002, following coverage of concerns about deflation in the business news, Bernanke gave a speech about the topic.[68] In that speech, he mentioned that the government in a fiat money system owns the physical means of creating money and to maintain market liquidity. Control of the money supply implies that the government can always avoid deflation by simply issuing more money. He said, \"The U.S. government has a technology, called a printing press (or today, its electronic equivalent), that allows it to produce as many U.S. dollars as it wishes at no cost.\"[68]\n\n\nHe referred to a statement made by Milton Friedman about using a \"helicopter drop\" of money into the economy to fight deflation. Bernanke's critics have since referred to him as \"Helicopter Ben\" or to his \"helicopter printing press.\" In a footnote to his speech, Bernanke noted that \"people know that inflation erodes the real value of the government's debt and, therefore, that it is in the interest of the government to create some inflation.\"[68]\n\n\nFor example, while Greenspan publicly supported President Clinton's deficit reduction plan and the Bush tax cuts, Bernanke, when questioned about taxation policy, said that it was none of his business, his exclusive remit being monetary policy, and said that fiscal policy and wider society related issues were what politicians were for and got elected for. But Bernanke has been identified by *The Wall Street Journal* and a close colleague as a \"libertarian-Republican\" in the mold of Alan Greenspan.[63]\n\n\nIn 2005 Bernanke coined the term saving glut, the idea that relatively high level of worldwide savings was holding down interest rates and financing the current account deficits of the United States. (Alternative reasons include relatively low worldwide investment coupled with low U.S. savings.)[69]\n\n\nAs the recession began in 2007, many economists urged Bernanke (and the rest of the Federal Open Market Committee) to lower the federal funds rate below what it had done. For example, Larry Summers, later named Director of the White House's National Economic Council under President Obama, wrote in the *Financial Times* on November 26, 2007—in a column in which he argued that recession was likely—that \"maintaining demand must be the over-arching macro-economic priority. That means the Federal Reserve System has to get ahead of the curve and recognize—as the market already has—that levels of the Federal Funds rate that were neutral when the financial system was working normally are quite contractionary today.\"[70]\n\n\nDavid Leonhardt of *The New York Times* wrote, on January 30, 2008, that \"Dr. Bernanke's forecasts have been too sunny over the last six months. [On] the other hand, his forecast was a lot better than Wall Street's in mid-2006. Back then, he resisted calls for further interest rate increases because he thought the economy might be weakening.\"[71]\n\n\n\n## After the Federal Reserve[edit]\n\n\n![](image)From left to right: Janet Yellen, Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke, and Paul Volcker, May 1, 2014.\nIn a speech at the American Economics Association conference in January 2014, Bernanke reflected on his tenure as chairman of the Federal Reserve. He expressed his hope that economic growth was building momentum and stated that he was confident that the central bank would be able to withdraw its support smoothly.[72]\n\n\nIn an October 2014 speech, Bernanke disclosed that he was unsuccessful in efforts to refinance his home. He suggested that lenders \"may have gone a little bit too far on mortgage credit conditions\".[73]\n\n\nSince February 2014, Bernanke has been employed as a Distinguished Fellow in Residence with the Economic Studies Program at the Brookings Institution.[74]\n\n\nOn April 16, 2015, it was announced publicly that Bernanke will work with Citadel, the $25 billion hedge fund founded by billionaire Kenneth C. Griffin, as a senior adviser.[75] In the same month it was revealed that Bernanke would also join PIMCO as a senior advisor.[76]\n\n\nIn his 2015 book, *The Courage to Act*, Bernanke revealed that he was no longer a Republican, having \"lost patience with Republicans' susceptibility to the know-nothing-ism of the far right. ... I view myself now as a moderate independent, and I think that's where I'll stay.\"[77]\n\n\nBernanke published in 2022 his latest book titled *21st Century Monetary Policy: The Federal Reserve from the Great Inflation to COVID-19,* where he assesses the successes as well as failures of the Federal Reserve since its inception. The book received a positive review from the New York Times saying the \"book is intended to help future generations of economic policymakers, and it probably will.\"[78]\n\n\n\n## Statements on deficit reduction and reform of Social Security/Medicare[edit]\n\n\nBernanke favors reducing the U.S. budget deficit, particularly by reforming the Social Security and Medicare entitlement programs. During a speech delivered on April 7, 2010, he warned that the U.S. must soon develop a \"credible\" plan to address the pending funding crisis faced by \"entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare\" or \"in the longer run we will have neither financial stability nor healthy economic growth.\"[79][80] Bernanke said that formulation of such a plan would help the economy in the near term, even if actual implementation of the plan might have to wait until the economic outlook improves.[81]\n\n\nHis remarks were most likely intended for the federal government's executive and legislative branches,[82] since entitlement reform is a fiscal exercise that will be accomplished by the Congress and the President[83][84] rather than a monetary task falling within the implementation powers of the Federal Reserve. Bernanke also pointed out that deficit reduction will necessarily consist of either raising taxes, cutting entitlement payments and other government spending, or some combination of both.[85]\n\n\n\n## Nobel Prize[edit]\n\n\nIn 2022 Bernanke was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences along with Philip H. Dybvig and Douglas Diamond. Their research suggested that the Great Depression was caused by a variety of factors including credit market stress and a failing gold standard. With a rising External Finance Premium lenders and borrowers were both inclined to protect their financial health due to stressed credit markets. Lenders began tightening credit standards and avoiding risky borrowers while borrowers withdrew their cash. These self-preservation decisions from both lenders and borrowers resulted in further stress on the credit market and stagnation in investment spending. In addition to stressed credit markets, the failing gold standard also played a crucial role. After World War 1 most countries had their currencies tied to gold as well as fixed exchange rates, however, post-war animosity between many European nations led to non-cooperation regarding the gold standard. Consequently, the gold standard failed in the late 1920s, bringing prices, money supply, and output down with it. Their research showed that the combination of a failing gold standard and stressed credit markets led to a catastrophic spiral in the economy.[86]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ben and Anna Bernanke\nBernanke met his wife, Anna, a schoolteacher, on a blind date. The Bernankes have two children, Joel and Alyssa.[87] He is an ardent fan of the Washington Nationals baseball team, and frequently attends games at Nationals Park.[88]\n\n\nWhen Bernanke left Stanford to accept a position at Princeton, he and his family moved to Montgomery Township, New Jersey, in 1985, where Bernanke's children attended the local public schools.[89] Bernanke served for six years as a member of the board of education of the Montgomery Township School District.[89]\n\n\n\nIn 2009, *The Wall Street Journal* reported that Bernanke was a victim of identity theft, a spreading crime the Federal Reserve has for years issued warnings about.[90]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\n* Fellow of the Econometric Society (1997)\n* Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2001)[91]\n* Order of the Palmetto (2006)[14]\n* Member of the American Philosophical Society (2006)[92]\n* Distinguished Leadership in Government Award, Columbia Business School (2008)[93]\n* In 2009, the South Carolina Department of Transportation (SCDOT) Commission approved a resolution on February 21 to name Exit 190 along Interstate Highway 95 in Dillon County the *Ben Bernanke Interchange*.[94]\n* In 2009, he was named the *Time* magazine person of the year.[95]\n* In 2020 he was awarded the BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in the category \"Economics, Finance and Management\".[96]\n* Member of the National Academy of Sciences (2021)[97]\n* Along with Douglas W.

He is currently the Merton H. Miller Distinguished Service Professor of Finance at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, where he has taught since 1979. Diamond specializes in the study of financial intermediaries, financial crises, and liquidity. He is a former president of the American Finance Association (2003) and the Western Finance Association (2001-02).\n\n\nIn October 2022, Diamond was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences jointly with Ben Bernanke and Philip H. Dybvig. The prize was awarded in recognition of the economists' \"research on banks and financial crises\"[3][4]\n\n\nDiamond is best known for his work on financial crises and bank runs, particularly the influential Diamond–Dybvig model published in 1983 and the Diamond model of delegated monitoring published in 1984.[5] In 2016, he was awarded the CME Group-MSRI Prize in Innovative Quantitative Applications.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nDouglas Warren Diamond was born on October 25, 1953.[2] He was raised in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Chicago by a single mother.[7][8]\n\n\nAs an adolescent, Diamond originally intended to study molecular biology. Diamond matriculated at Brown University, where he decided to study economics instead, after taking a course on Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz's *A Monetary History of the United States*.[7][8] He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Brown with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics in 1975.[9] The following year, and in 1977 Diamond earned Master's degrees, and ultimately a PhD in economics in 1980 from Yale University.[9] At Yale, both Diamond and future Nobel co-recipient Philip H. Dybvig were advised by Stephen A. Ross. According to Diamond, the two would regularly converse outside Ross' office while waiting for appointments with him.[10][11]\n\n\nA later version of the third chapter of Diamond's 1980 doctoral dissertation \"Essays on Information and Financial Intermediation\" was republished in 1984 in *The Review of Economic Studies* under the title \"Financial Intermediation and Delegated Monitoring\"[12][5] This publication coined the term \"delegated monitoring\" and described Diamond's formal model of delegated monitoring.[13] According to the Committee for the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, Diamond's model is considered \"the first truly micro-founded theory of financial intermediation.\"[14] Since its publication, Diamond (1984) has become a key publication in scholarship concerning financial intermediation.[14]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nSince 1979, Diamond has taught at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. He has held the Merton H. Miller Distinguished Service Professorship since July 2000, having previously held the Theodore O. Yntema Professorship.[9] From 2010 to 2014, Diamond directed the Fama-Miller Center for Research in Finance at the University of Chicago.\n\n\nDiamond has additionally served as a visiting scholar at the University of Bonn (1983) and the Bank of Japan (1999), as visiting professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and MIT Sloan School of Management, and as a professor and teaching fellow at the Yale School of Management.[9]\n\n\n\n### Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics[edit]\n\n\nIn the early 2010s, Diamond was repeatedly floated as a contender for the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. In 2011, Diamond was listed by Thomson Reuters as one of the \"researchers likely to be in contention for Nobel honors based on the citation impact of their published research.\"[15] He was again named as a contender for the prize in 2013 by economist Hubert Fromlet,[16] *The Wall Street Journal,*[17] and Catherine Rampell, writing for *The New York Times.*[18]\n\n\nOn October 10, 2022, Diamond received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences jointly with long-time collaborator Philip H. Dybvig and former Chair of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke. Much of the work for which the prize was awarded stems from work Diamond and Dybvig published in the early and mid-1980s.[19]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nDiamond has been married to Elizabeth Cammack Diamond since 1982.[20] The couple has two children,[21] including economist Rebecca Diamond.[22]\n\n\nHe is the son of Leon Diamond,[23][24] a psychiatrist, and Margaret Gunkel Seehafer, a social worker and professor.[25]\n\n\n\n## Honors and awards[edit]\n\n\n* Fellow, Econometric Society (since 1990)[26]\n* Member, American Academy of Arts and Sciences (elected 2001)[27]\n* Fellow, American Finance Association (selected 2004)[28]\n* Economic Theory Fellow, Society for the Advancement of Economic Theory (2016)\n* Member, National Academy of Sciences (elected 2017)[29]\n\n\n### Awards[edit]\n\n\n* Morgan Stanley-American Finance Association Award for Excellence in Finance, 2012[30]\n* Doctor Honoris Causa, University of Zurich, 2013[31]\n* CME Group-MSRI Prize in Innovative Quantitative Applications, 2016[29][6]\n* Wilbur Cross Medal, 2017[31]\n* Onassis Prize in Finance, 2018[32]\n* Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, 2022[3]\n\n\n## Publications[edit]\n\n\n### Articles[edit]\n\n\n* Diamond, Douglas; Rajan, Raghuram (April 2009). \"Fear of Fire Sales and the Credit Freeze\". doi:10.3386/w14925. `{{cite journal}}`: Cite journal requires `|journal=` (help)\n* Diamond, Douglas W.; Rajan, Raghuram G.

He is currently the Merton H. Miller Distinguished Service Professor of Finance at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, where he has taught since 1979. Diamond specializes in the study of financial intermediaries, financial crises, and liquidity. He is a former president of the American Finance Association (2003) and the Western Finance Association (2001-02).\n\n\nIn October 2022, Diamond was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences jointly with Ben Bernanke and Philip H. Dybvig. The prize was awarded in recognition of the economists' \"research on banks and financial crises\"[3][4]\n\n\nDiamond is best known for his work on financial crises and bank runs, particularly the influential Diamond–Dybvig model published in 1983 and the Diamond model of delegated monitoring published in 1984.[5] In 2016, he was awarded the CME Group-MSRI Prize in Innovative Quantitative Applications.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nDouglas Warren Diamond was born on October 25, 1953.[2] He was raised in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Chicago by a single mother.[7][8]\n\n\nAs an adolescent, Diamond originally intended to study molecular biology. Diamond matriculated at Brown University, where he decided to study economics instead, after taking a course on Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz's *A Monetary History of the United States*.[7][8] He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Brown with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics in 1975.[9] The following year, and in 1977 Diamond earned Master's degrees, and ultimately a PhD in economics in 1980 from Yale University.[9] At Yale, both Diamond and future Nobel co-recipient Philip H. Dybvig were advised by Stephen A. Ross. According to Diamond, the two would regularly converse outside Ross' office while waiting for appointments with him.[10][11]\n\n\nA later version of the third chapter of Diamond's 1980 doctoral dissertation \"Essays on Information and Financial Intermediation\" was republished in 1984 in *The Review of Economic Studies* under the title \"Financial Intermediation and Delegated Monitoring\"[12][5] This publication coined the term \"delegated monitoring\" and described Diamond's formal model of delegated monitoring.[13] According to the Committee for the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, Diamond's model is considered \"the first truly micro-founded theory of financial intermediation.\"[14] Since its publication, Diamond (1984) has become a key publication in scholarship concerning financial intermediation.[14]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nSince 1979, Diamond has taught at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. He has held the Merton H. Miller Distinguished Service Professorship since July 2000, having previously held the Theodore O. Yntema Professorship.[9] From 2010 to 2014, Diamond directed the Fama-Miller Center for Research in Finance at the University of Chicago.\n\n\nDiamond has additionally served as a visiting scholar at the University of Bonn (1983) and the Bank of Japan (1999), as visiting professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and MIT Sloan School of Management, and as a professor and teaching fellow at the Yale School of Management.[9]\n\n\n\n### Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics[edit]\n\n\nIn the early 2010s, Diamond was repeatedly floated as a contender for the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. In 2011, Diamond was listed by Thomson Reuters as one of the \"researchers likely to be in contention for Nobel honors based on the citation impact of their published research.\"[15] He was again named as a contender for the prize in 2013 by economist Hubert Fromlet,[16] *The Wall Street Journal,*[17] and Catherine Rampell, writing for *The New York Times.*[18]\n\n\nOn October 10, 2022, Diamond received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences jointly with long-time collaborator Philip H. Dybvig and former Chair of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke. Much of the work for which the prize was awarded stems from work Diamond and Dybvig published in the early and mid-1980s.[19]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nDiamond has been married to Elizabeth Cammack Diamond since 1982.[20] The couple has two children,[21] including economist Rebecca Diamond.[22]\n\n\nHe is the son of Leon Diamond,[23][24] a psychiatrist, and Margaret Gunkel Seehafer, a social worker and professor.[25]\n\n\n\n## Honors and awards[edit]\n\n\n* Fellow, Econometric Society (since 1990)[26]\n* Member, American Academy of Arts and Sciences (elected 2001)[27]\n* Fellow, American Finance Association (selected 2004)[28]\n* Economic Theory Fellow, Society for the Advancement of Economic Theory (2016)\n* Member, National Academy of Sciences (elected 2017)[29]\n\n\n### Awards[edit]\n\n\n* Morgan Stanley-American Finance Association Award for Excellence in Finance, 2012[30]\n* Doctor Honoris Causa, University of Zurich, 2013[31]\n* CME Group-MSRI Prize in Innovative Quantitative Applications, 2016[29][6]\n* Wilbur Cross Medal, 2017[31]\n* Onassis Prize in Finance, 2018[32]\n* Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, 2022[3]\n\n\n## Publications[edit]\n\n\n### Articles[edit]\n\n\n* Diamond, Douglas; Rajan, Raghuram (April 2009). \"Fear of Fire Sales and the Credit Freeze\". doi:10.3386/w14925. `{{cite journal}}`: Cite journal requires `|journal=` (help)\n* Diamond, Douglas W.; Rajan, Raghuram G.

He is the Boatmen's Bancshares Professor of Banking and Finance at the Olin Business School of Washington University in St. Louis.[1][2]\n\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nDybvig attended Indiana University and received in 1976 a BA in mathematics and physics. He then attended the economics PhD program at University of Pennsylvania for one year before transferring to Yale University, where he received the MA (1978), MPhil (1978), and PhD (1979) degrees in economics.[3] His thesis, titled \"Recovering additive utility functions\", was supervised by Stephen A. Ross.[4]\n\n\nDybvig specializes in asset pricing, banking, investments, and corporate governance.[5] He was formerly a professor at Yale University, and assistant professor at Princeton University. \n\n\nDybvig was president of the Western Finance Association from 2002 to 2003, and was director of the Institute of Financial Studies at Southwestern University of Finance and Economics (Chengdu, PRC) from 2010 to 2021. He has been editor or associate editor of multiple journals, including the *Journal of Economic Theory*, *Finance and Stochastics*, *Journal of Finance*, *Journal of Financial Intermediation*, *Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis*, and *Review of Financial Studies*.[3]\n\n\nDybvig is known for his work with Douglas Diamond on the Diamond–Dybvig model of bank runs.[6]\n\n\nDybvig was awarded the 2022 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, jointly with Diamond and Ben Bernanke, \"for research on banks and financial crises\".[7][8] Dybvig and Diamond wrote “Bank Runs, Deposit Insurance, and Liquidity” in 1983, in which they first introduced their mathematical model describing the vulnerability of banks during financial crises.\n\n\n\n## Alleged sexual misconduct[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2022, Dybvig was anonymously accused of sexual harassment by several Chinese women attending Washington University’s Olin School of Business, where Dybvig works as a professor.[9][10] He is on absentee leave until July 2023. Dybvig's lawyer has denied the allegations. Bloomberg News reported that he was said to have called one of the students \"tián mèizi\" (甜妹子), meaning \"sweet young girl\" and gave her gifts of chocolate.[11] The encounters allegedly led the Chinese female students to warn each other about him.[11]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"2022 Nobel Prize Celebrates Banking Research\". *www.nber.org*.

He is the Boatmen's Bancshares Professor of Banking and Finance at the Olin Business School of Washington University in St. Louis.[1][2]\n\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nDybvig attended Indiana University and received in 1976 a BA in mathematics and physics. He then attended the economics PhD program at University of Pennsylvania for one year before transferring to Yale University, where he received the MA (1978), MPhil (1978), and PhD (1979) degrees in economics.[3] His thesis, titled \"Recovering additive utility functions\", was supervised by Stephen A. Ross.[4]\n\n\nDybvig specializes in asset pricing, banking, investments, and corporate governance.[5] He was formerly a professor at Yale University, and assistant professor at Princeton University. \n\n\nDybvig was president of the Western Finance Association from 2002 to 2003, and was director of the Institute of Financial Studies at Southwestern University of Finance and Economics (Chengdu, PRC) from 2010 to 2021. He has been editor or associate editor of multiple journals, including the *Journal of Economic Theory*, *Finance and Stochastics*, *Journal of Finance*, *Journal of Financial Intermediation*, *Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis*, and *Review of Financial Studies*.[3]\n\n\nDybvig is known for his work with Douglas Diamond on the Diamond–Dybvig model of bank runs.[6]\n\n\nDybvig was awarded the 2022 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, jointly with Diamond and Ben Bernanke, \"for research on banks and financial crises\".[7][8] Dybvig and Diamond wrote “Bank Runs, Deposit Insurance, and Liquidity” in 1983, in which they first introduced their mathematical model describing the vulnerability of banks during financial crises.\n\n\n\n## Alleged sexual misconduct[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2022, Dybvig was anonymously accused of sexual harassment by several Chinese women attending Washington University’s Olin School of Business, where Dybvig works as a professor.[9][10] He is on absentee leave until July 2023. Dybvig's lawyer has denied the allegations. Bloomberg News reported that he was said to have called one of the students \"tián mèizi\" (甜妹子), meaning \"sweet young girl\" and gave her gifts of chocolate.[11] The encounters allegedly led the Chinese female students to warn each other about him.[11]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"2022 Nobel Prize Celebrates Banking Research\". *www.nber.org*.
