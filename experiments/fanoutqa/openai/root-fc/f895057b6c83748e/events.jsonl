During the centralized growth of Japan's economy following World War II, many large firms moved their headquarters from cities such as Osaka (the historical commercial capital) to Tokyo, in an attempt to take advantage of better access to the government. This trend has begun to slow due to ongoing population growth in Tokyo and the high cost of living there.\n\n\nTokyo was rated by the Economist Intelligence Unit as the most expensive (highest cost-of-living) city in the world for 14 years in a row ending in 2006, when it was replaced by Oslo, and later Paris.[101][102]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** 都庁は長野市.

In the 1980s, real estate prices skyrocketed during a real estate and debt bubble. The bubble burst in the early 1990s, and many companies, banks, and individuals were caught with mortgage-backed debts while real estate was shrinking in value. A major recession followed, making the 1990s Japan's \"Lost Decade\",[38] from which it is now slowly recovering.\n\n\nTokyo still sees new urban developments on large lots of less profitable land. Recent projects include Ebisu Garden Place, Tennōzu Isle, Shiodome, Roppongi Hills, Shinagawa (Shinagawa Station, a major hub for Shinkansen), and the Marunouchi side of Tokyo Station. Buildings of significance have been demolished for more up-to-date shopping facilities such as Omotesando Hills.[39]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTokyo emerged as a leading international financial center (IFC) in the 1960s and has been described as one of the three \"command centers\" for the world economy, along with New York City and London.[103] In the 2020 Global Financial Centers Index, Tokyo was ranked as having the fourth most competitive financial center in the world (alongside cities such as New York City, London, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore, Beijing, San Francisco, Shenzhen and Zurich in the top 10), and second most competitive in Asia (after Shanghai).[12] The Japanese financial market opened up slowly in 1984 and accelerated its internationalization with the \"Japanese Big Bang\" in 1998.[104] Despite the emergence of Singapore and Hong Kong as competing financial centers, the Tokyo IFC manages to keep a prominent position in Asia. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is Japan's largest stock exchange, and third largest in the world by market capitalization and fourth largest by share turnover. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n131. **^** Houston, Michael (August 27, 2021). \"Tokyo Metropolitan Government signs MoU with 2028 Olympic host City of Los Angeles\". *Inside the Game*.

The 1970s and the 1980s brought new high-rise developments. In 1978, Sunshine 60 – the tallest skyscraper in Asia until 1985, and in Japan until 1991[35] – and Narita International Airport were constructed, and the population increased to about 11 million in the metropolitan area.[36] The Edo-Tokyo Open Air Architectural Museum has historic Japanese buildings that existed in the urban landscape of pre-war Tokyo.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the 20th and 21st centuries, Tokyo has hosted several major international events, including the 1964 Summer Olympics and 1964 Summer Paralympics, the 2020 Summer Olympics, and three G7 summits in 1979, 1986, and 1993. Tokyo is an international research and development hub and an academic center with several major universities, including the University of Tokyo. Tokyo Station is the central hub for the Shinkansen, Japan's high-speed railway network, and Shinjuku Station in Tokyo is the world's busiest train station. Notable special wards in Tokyo include Chiyoda, the site of the National Diet Building and the Tokyo Imperial Palace, Shinjuku, the city's administrative center, and Shibuya, a commercial, cultural, and business hub in the city.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Tokyo |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| ![](image)*Tōkyō* in *kanji*\n |\n| Japanese name |\n| Kanji | 東京 |\n| Hiragana | とうきょう |\n| Katakana | トウキョウ |\n| Kyūjitai | 東亰 |\n| \n\n| Transcriptions |\n| --- |\n| Romanization | Tōkyō |\n| Revised Hepburn | Toukyou |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2006, Tokyo enacted the \"10 Year Project for Green Tokyo\" to be realized by 2016.

Its administrative structure is similar to that of Japan's other prefectures.

Twice in recent history has the metropolis been left in ruins: first in the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake and later after extensive firebombing in World War II.[87] Because of this, Tokyo's urban landscape consists mainly of modern and contemporary architecture, and older buildings are scarce.[87] Tokyo features many internationally famous forms of modern architecture including Tokyo International Forum, Asahi Beer Hall, Mode Gakuen Cocoon Tower, NTT Docomo Yoyogi Building and Rainbow Bridge. Tokyo features two distinctive towers: Tokyo Tower and Tokyo Skytree, the latter of which is the tallest tower in both Japan and the world, and the second tallest structure in the world after the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.[13] Mori Building Co started work on Tokyo's new tallest building which was set to be finished in March 2023. The project will cost 580 billion yen ($5.5 billion).[88]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe deadliest night of the war came on March 9-10, 1945, the night of the American \"Operation Meetinghouse\" raid;[30] as nearly 700,000 incendiary bombs rained on the eastern half of the city, mainly in heavily residential wards. Two-fifths of the city were completely burned, more than 276,000 buildings were demolished, 100,000 civilians were killed, and 110,000 more were injured.[31][32] Between 1940 and 1945, the population of Japan's capital city dwindled from 6,700,000 to less than 2,800,000, with the majority of those who lost their homes living in \"ramshackle, makeshift huts\".[33]\n\n\n\n* Gallery\n* ![The bombing of Tokyo in 1945](image)\n\nThe bombing of Tokyo in 1945\n* ![The aftermath of the bombing of Tokyo, March 1945](image)\n\nThe aftermath of the bombing of Tokyo, March 1945\n* ![Nihonbashi in 1946](image)\n\nNihonbashi in 1946\n\n\n### 1945–present[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n120. **^** Perry, Chris (April 25, 2007).

In 1603, however, the city ascended to political prominence after being named the seat of the Tokugawa shogunate. By the mid-18th century, Edo emerged as one of the world's most-populous cities with a population of over one million people. Following the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the imperial capital in Kyoto was moved to Edo, and the city was renamed Tokyo (lit. 'Eastern Capital'). In 1923, Tokyo was damaged substantially by the Great Kanttō earthquake and was later decimated by allied bombing raids during World War II in retailiation for Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. \n\n\nSince 1943, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government has administered the prefecture's special wards, including Tokyo City), various commuter towns and suburbs in its western area, and two outlying island chains known as the Tokyo Islands.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 東京都 | Tōkyō-to | Tokyo \"Metropolis\"functionally: ~ Prefectureliterally/etymologically: ~ Capital | – | 13,960,236 | 13000ISO: JP-13\n |\n\n\n* ![Tama](image)\n\nTama\n* ![Hachioji](image)\n\nHachioji\n* ![Musashino](image)\n\nMusashino\n\n\n#### Municipal mergers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of mergers in Tokyo\n\nWhen Tokyo reached its current extent except for smaller border changes in 1893, it consisted of over 170 municipalities, 1 (by definition: district-independent) city, nine districts with their towns and villages, plus the island communities that had never part of ritsuryō[*clarification needed*] districts.

The MAOUDC is a 6.3 km (3.9 mi) long system of tunnels, 22 meters (72 ft) underground, with 70-meter (230 ft) tall cylindrical tanks, each tank being large enough to fit a space shuttle or the Statue of Liberty.[67] During floods, excess water is collected from rivers and drained to the Edo River.[68] Low-lying areas of Kōtō, Edogawa, Sumida, Katsushika, Taitō and Arakawa near the Arakawa River are most at risk of flooding.[68]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* **Moscow**, Russia\n | * **Camp Thunder Cove**, *BIOT* (UK) **\\***\n* **Dhaka**, Bangladesh\n* **Islamabad**, Pakistan\n* **Kabul**, Afghanistan\n* **Kathmandu**, Nepal\n* **Malé**, Maldives\n* **New Delhi**, India\n* **Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte**, Sri Lanka\n* **Thimphu**, Bhutan\n | * **Bandar Seri Begawan**, Brunei\n* **Bangkok**, Thailand\n* **Dili**, East Timor\n* **Flying Fish Cove**, *Christmas Island* (Australia)\n* **Hanoi**, Vietnam\n* **Jakarta**, Indonesia\n* **Kuala Lumpur**, Malaysia\n* **Manila**, Philippines\n* **Naypyidaw**, Myanmar\n* **Phnom Penh**, Cambodia\n* **Singapore**\n* **Vientiane**, Laos\n* **West Island**, *Cocos (Keeling) Islands* (Australia)\n | * **Abu Dhabi**, United Arab Emirates\n* **Amman**, Jordan\n* **Ankara**, Turkey\n* **Baghdad**, Iraq\n* **Baku**, Azerbaijan\n* **Beirut**, Lebanon\n* **Damascus**, Syria\n* **Doha**, Qatar\n* **Episkopi Cantonment**, *Akrotiri and Dhekelia* (UK)\n* **Jerusalem**, Israel **\\***\n* **Kuwait City**, Kuwait\n* **Manama**, Bahrain\n | * **Muscat**, Oman\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn September 7, 2013, the IOC selected Tokyo to host the 2020 Summer Olympics. Tokyo thus became the first Asian city to host the Olympic Games twice.[46] However, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 Olympic Games took place from July 23, 2021, to August 8, 2021. It is also unclear how the city will deal with an increasing number of issues, urging scholars to offer possible alternatives approaches to tackle the most urgent problems.[47] Although, the COVID-19 pandemic in Tokyo has impeded the growth of many industries, the real estate market in Japan is yet to be negatively impacted. Japanese real estate has become one of the safest investments for foreign investors around the world.[48]\n\n\n\n* Gallery\n* ![Tokyo Tower, built in 1958](image)\n\nTokyo Tower, built in 1958\n* ![Yoyogi National Gymnasium, built for the 1964 Summer Olympics](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nCapitals of Asia\n |\n| --- |\n| Dependent territories and states with limited recognition are in *italics*\n |\n| |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Central Asia | South Asia | Southeast Asia | West Asia |\n| * **Ashgabat**, Turkmenistan\n* **Astana**, Kazakhstan\n* **Bishkek**, Kyrgyzstan\n* **Dushanbe**, Tajikistan\n* **Tashkent**, Uzbekistan\n\n\n**East Asia**\n\n* **Beijing**, China\n* **Pyongyang**, North Korea\n* **Seoul**, South Korea\n* **Taipei**, *Taiwan*\n* **Tokyo**, Japan\n* **Ulaanbaatar**, Mongolia\n\n\n**North Asia**\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJapanese author Haruki Murakami has based some of his novels in Tokyo (including *Norwegian Wood*), and David Mitchell's first two novels (*number9dream* and *Ghostwritten*) featured the city.

There are up to 62 electric train lines and more than 900 train stations in Tokyo.[111] Shibuya Crossing is the \"world's busiest pedestrian crossing\", with around 3,000 people crossing at a time.[112][113][114]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![](image) Toshima | 豊島区 | Toshima-ku | Toshima Ward(after Toshima District) | 294,673 | 13116\n |\n| ![](image) Akiruno | あきる野市 | Akiruno-shi | Akiruno City\n | 80,464 | 13228\n |\n| ![](image) Akishima | 昭島市 | Akishima-shi | Akishima City\n | 111,449 | 13207\n |\n| ![](image) Chōfu | 調布市 | Chōfu-shi | Chōfu City\n | 240,668 | 13208\n |\n| ![](image) Fuchū | 府中市 | Fuchū-shi | Fuchū City(provincial capital city) | 260,891 | 13206\n |\n| ![](image) Fussa | 福生市 | Fussa-shi | Fussa City\n | 58,393 | 13218\n |\n| ![](image) Hachiōji | 八王子市 | Hachiōji-shi | Hachiōji City\n | 579,330 | 13201\n |\n| ![](image) Hamura | 羽村市 | Hamura-shi | Hamura City\n | 55,596 | 13227\n |\n| ![](image) Higashikurume | 東久留米市 | Higashi-Kurume-shi | Higashi-Kurume CityEast Kurume City(as opposed to Kurume City, Western Japan) | 116,869 | 13222\n |\n| ![](image) Higashimurayama | 東村山市 | Higashi-Murayama-shi | Higashi-Murayama CityEast Murayama City(after Murayama Region) | 150,984 | 13213\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLand reclamation projects in Tokyo have also been going on for centuries. The most prominent is the Odaiba area, now a major shopping and entertainment center. Various plans have been proposed[40] for transferring national government functions from Tokyo to secondary capitals in other regions of Japan, to slow down rapid development in Tokyo and revitalize economically lagging areas of the country. These plans have been controversial[41] within Japan and have yet to be realized.\n\n\nThe 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami that devastated much of the northeastern coast of Honshu was felt in Tokyo. However, due to Tokyo's earthquake-resistant infrastructure, damage in Tokyo was very minor compared to areas directly hit by the tsunami,[42] although activity in the city was largely halted.[43] The subsequent nuclear crisis caused by the tsunami has also largely left Tokyo unaffected, despite occasional spikes in radiation levels.[44][45]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![](image) Hachijō | 八丈町 | Hachijō-machi | Hachijō Town(on Hachijō Island) | Hachijō | 7,516 | 13401\n |\n| ![](image) Aogashima | 青ヶ島村 | Aogashima-mura | Aogashima Village(on Aogashima) | 169 | 13402\n |\n| ![](image) Miyake | 三宅村 | Miyake-mura | Miyake Village(on Miyake Island) | Miyake | 2,451 | 13381\n |\n| ![](image) Mikurajima | 御蔵島村 | Mikurajima-mura | Mikurajima Village(Mikura Island Village)\n | 328 | 13382\n |\n| ![](image) Ōshima | 大島町 | Ōshima-machi | Ōshima Town([Izu] Grand Island Town) | Ōshima | 7,762 | 13361\n |\n| ![](image) To-shima | 利島村 | Toshima-mura | To-shima Village(on homonymous island) | 309 | 13362\n |\n| ![](image) Niijima | 新島村 | Niijima-mura | Niijima Village(on homonymous island) | 2,697 | 13363\n |\n| ![](image) Kōzushima | 神津島村 | Kōzushima-mura | Kōzushima Village(on homonymous island) | 1,856 | 13364\n |\n| ![](image) Ogasawara | 小笠原村 | Ogasawara-mura | Ogasawara Village(on homonymous islands) | Ogasawara | 3,029 | 13421\n |\n| ![](image) Tokyo\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Hokkaidō | * Hokkaido\n |\n| Tōhoku | * Aomori\n* Iwate\n* Miyagi\n* Akita\n* Yamagata\n* Fukushima\n |\n| Kantō | * Ibaraki\n* Tochigi\n* Gunma\n* Saitama\n* Chiba\n* Tokyo\n* Kanagawa\n |\n| Chūbu | * Niigata\n* Toyama\n* Ishikawa\n* Fukui\n* Yamanashi\n* Nagano\n* Gifu\n* Shizuoka\n* Aichi\n |\n| Kansai | * Mie\n* Shiga\n* Kyoto\n* Osaka\n* Hyōgo\n* Nara\n* Wakayama\n |\n| Chūgoku | * Tottori\n* Shimane\n* Okayama\n* Hiroshima\n* Yamaguchi\n |\n| Shikoku | * Tokushima\n* Kagawa\n* Ehime\n* Kōchi\n |\n| Kyūshū | * Fukuoka\n* Saga\n* Nagasaki\n* Kumamoto\n* Ōita\n* Miyazaki\n* Kagoshima\n* Okinawa\n |\n\n |\n| * Category\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMetropolitan cities of Japan\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAccording to *Around the Rings*, the gymnasium has played host to the October 2011 artistic gymnastics world championships, despite the International Gymnastics Federation's initial doubt in Tokyo's ability to host the championships following the March 11 tsunami.[122] Tokyo was also selected to host a number of games for the 2019 Rugby World Cup, and to host the 2020 Summer Olympics and the Paralympics which had to be rescheduled to the summer of 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan.\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTokyo contains numerous parks and gardens.

Governor Shintaro Ishihara created Japan's first emissions cap system, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emission by a total of 25% by 2020 from the 2000 level.[89] Tokyo is an example of an urban heat island, and the phenomenon is especially serious in its special wards.[90][91] According to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government,[92] the annual mean temperature has increased by about 3 °C (5.4 °F) over the past 100 years. Tokyo has been cited as a \"convincing example of the relationship between urban growth and climate\".[90]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)A satellite photo of Tokyo in 2018 taken by ESA Sentinel-2\n![](image)The Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building\nThe mainland portion of Tokyo lies northwest of Tokyo Bay and measures about 90 km (56 mi) east to west and 25 km (16 mi) north to south. The average elevation in Tokyo is 40 m (131 ft).[49] Chiba Prefecture borders it to the east, Yamanashi to the west, Kanagawa to the south, and Saitama to the north. Mainland Tokyo is further subdivided into the special wards (occupying the eastern half) and the Tama area (多摩地域) stretching westwards. Tokyo has a latitude of 35.65 (near the 36th parallel north), which makes it more southern than Rome (41.90), Madrid (40.41), New York City (40.71) and Beijing (39.91).[50]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n19. **^** Fiévé, Nicolas & Paul Waley (2003). *Japanese Capitals in Historical Perspective: Place, Power and Memory in Kyoto, Edo and Tokyo*. p. 253.\n20. **^** 明治東京異聞～トウケイかトウキョウか～東京の読み方 (in Japanese).

The special wards use the word \"city\" in their official English name (e.g. Chiyoda City). The wards differ from other cities in having a unique administrative relationship with the prefectural government. Certain municipal functions, such as waterworks, sewerage, and fire-fighting, are handled by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. To pay for the added administrative costs, the prefecture collects municipal taxes, which would usually be levied by the city.[53] The \"three central wards\" of Tokyo – Chiyoda, Chūō and Minato – are the business core of the city, with a daytime population more than seven times higher than their nighttime population.[54] Chiyoda Ward is unique in that it is in the very heart of the former Tokyo City, yet is one of the least populated wards. It is occupied by many major Japanese companies and is also the seat of the national government, and the Japanese emperor. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n60. **^** \"General overview of area figures for Natural Parks by prefecture\" (PDF).

World War II wreaked widespread destruction of most of the city due to the persistent Allied air raids on Japan and the use of incendiary bombs. The bombing of Tokyo in 1944 and 1945 is estimated to have killed between 75,000 and 200,000 civilians and left more than half of the city destroyed.[29]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_APsU221vZBrlVMc6m86CKKzs","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

During the centralized growth of Japan's economy following World War II, many large firms moved their headquarters from cities such as Osaka (the historical commercial capital) to Tokyo, in an attempt to take advantage of better access to the government. This trend has begun to slow due to ongoing population growth in Tokyo and the high cost of living there.\n\n\nTokyo was rated by the Economist Intelligence Unit as the most expensive (highest cost-of-living) city in the world for 14 years in a row ending in 2006, when it was replaced by Oslo, and later Paris.[101][102]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** 都庁は長野市.

In the 1980s, real estate prices skyrocketed during a real estate and debt bubble. The bubble burst in the early 1990s, and many companies, banks, and individuals were caught with mortgage-backed debts while real estate was shrinking in value. A major recession followed, making the 1990s Japan's \"Lost Decade\",[38] from which it is now slowly recovering.\n\n\nTokyo still sees new urban developments on large lots of less profitable land. Recent projects include Ebisu Garden Place, Tennōzu Isle, Shiodome, Roppongi Hills, Shinagawa (Shinagawa Station, a major hub for Shinkansen), and the Marunouchi side of Tokyo Station. Buildings of significance have been demolished for more up-to-date shopping facilities such as Omotesando Hills.[39]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTokyo emerged as a leading international financial center (IFC) in the 1960s and has been described as one of the three \"command centers\" for the world economy, along with New York City and London.[103] In the 2020 Global Financial Centers Index, Tokyo was ranked as having the fourth most competitive financial center in the world (alongside cities such as New York City, London, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore, Beijing, San Francisco, Shenzhen and Zurich in the top 10), and second most competitive in Asia (after Shanghai).[12] The Japanese financial market opened up slowly in 1984 and accelerated its internationalization with the \"Japanese Big Bang\" in 1998.[104] Despite the emergence of Singapore and Hong Kong as competing financial centers, the Tokyo IFC manages to keep a prominent position in Asia. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is Japan's largest stock exchange, and third largest in the world by market capitalization and fourth largest by share turnover. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n131. **^** Houston, Michael (August 27, 2021). \"Tokyo Metropolitan Government signs MoU with 2028 Olympic host City of Los Angeles\". *Inside the Game*.

Twice in recent history has the metropolis been left in ruins: first in the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake and later after extensive firebombing in World War II.[87] Because of this, Tokyo's urban landscape consists mainly of modern and contemporary architecture, and older buildings are scarce.[87] Tokyo features many internationally famous forms of modern architecture including Tokyo International Forum, Asahi Beer Hall, Mode Gakuen Cocoon Tower, NTT Docomo Yoyogi Building and Rainbow Bridge. Tokyo features two distinctive towers: Tokyo Tower and Tokyo Skytree, the latter of which is the tallest tower in both Japan and the world, and the second tallest structure in the world after the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.[13] Mori Building Co started work on Tokyo's new tallest building which was set to be finished in March 2023. The project will cost 580 billion yen ($5.5 billion).[88]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe deadliest night of the war came on March 9-10, 1945, the night of the American \"Operation Meetinghouse\" raid;[30] as nearly 700,000 incendiary bombs rained on the eastern half of the city, mainly in heavily residential wards. Two-fifths of the city were completely burned, more than 276,000 buildings were demolished, 100,000 civilians were killed, and 110,000 more were injured.[31][32] Between 1940 and 1945, the population of Japan's capital city dwindled from 6,700,000 to less than 2,800,000, with the majority of those who lost their homes living in \"ramshackle, makeshift huts\".[33]\n\n\n\n* Gallery\n* ![The bombing of Tokyo in 1945](image)\n\nThe bombing of Tokyo in 1945\n* ![The aftermath of the bombing of Tokyo, March 1945](image)\n\nThe aftermath of the bombing of Tokyo, March 1945\n* ![Nihonbashi in 1946](image)\n\nNihonbashi in 1946\n\n\n### 1945–present[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n120. **^** Perry, Chris (April 25, 2007).

In 1603, however, the city ascended to political prominence after being named the seat of the Tokugawa shogunate. By the mid-18th century, Edo emerged as one of the world's most-populous cities with a population of over one million people. Following the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the imperial capital in Kyoto was moved to Edo, and the city was renamed Tokyo (lit. 'Eastern Capital'). In 1923, Tokyo was damaged substantially by the Great Kanttō earthquake and was later decimated by allied bombing raids during World War II in retailiation for Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. \n\n\nSince 1943, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government has administered the prefecture's special wards, including Tokyo City), various commuter towns and suburbs in its western area, and two outlying island chains known as the Tokyo Islands.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 東京都 | Tōkyō-to | Tokyo \"Metropolis\"functionally: ~ Prefectureliterally/etymologically: ~ Capital | – | 13,960,236 | 13000ISO: JP-13\n |\n\n\n* ![Tama](image)\n\nTama\n* ![Hachioji](image)\n\nHachioji\n* ![Musashino](image)\n\nMusashino\n\n\n#### Municipal mergers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of mergers in Tokyo\n\nWhen Tokyo reached its current extent except for smaller border changes in 1893, it consisted of over 170 municipalities, 1 (by definition: district-independent) city, nine districts with their towns and villages, plus the island communities that had never part of ritsuryō[*clarification needed*] districts.

It is also unclear how the city will deal with an increasing number of issues, urging scholars to offer possible alternatives approaches to tackle the most urgent problems.[47] Although, the COVID-19 pandemic in Tokyo has impeded the growth of many industries, the real estate market in Japan is yet to be negatively impacted.

It is located in the Toyosu area of Kōtō ward. The Toyosu Market holds strong to the traditions of its predecessor, the Tsukiji Fish Market and Nihonbashi fish market, and serves some 50,000 buyers and sellers every day. Retailers, whole-sellers, auctioneers, and public citizens alike frequent the market, creating a unique microcosm of organized chaos that still continues to fuel the city and its food supply after over four centuries.[109]\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transportation in Greater Tokyo\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTourism in Tokyo is also a contributor to the economy. In 2006, 4.81 million foreigners and 420 million Japanese visits to Tokyo were made; the economic value of these visits totaled 9.4 trillion yen according to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. Many tourists visit the various downtowns, stores, and entertainment districts throughout the neighborhoods of the special wards of Tokyo. Cultural offerings include both omnipresent Japanese pop culture and associated districts such as Shibuya and Harajuku, subcultural attractions such as Studio Ghibli anime center, as well as museums like the Tokyo National Museum, which houses 37% of the country's artwork national treasures (87/233).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ Tokyo\n* ![](image) **Heliports**\n\t+ Tokyo Heliport\n\t+ Camp Zama\n |\n| Miscellaneous | * Smart cards\n\t+ Pasmo\n\t+ Suica\n* Transport in Greater Tokyo\n* Rail transport in Japan\n* List of named passenger trains of Japan\n* List of through trains in Japan\n* Toei Subway rolling stock\n* Tokyo Metro rolling stock\n* List of East Japan Railway Company stations\n* List of Toei Subway stations\n* List of Tokyo Metro stations\n* Station numbering\n |\n| * **Japan transit**: Tokyo\n* Keihanshin\n* Nagoya\n* Fukuoka\n* Hakone Fuji Izu\n* Hokkaido\n* Aomori\n* Sendai\n* Akita\n* Niigata\n* Toyama\n* Nagano\n* Okayama\n* Hiroshima\n* Shikoku\n* Metro systems\n* Shinkansen\n* trams (list)\n* aerial lifts (list)\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMegacities\n |\n| --- |\n| Africa (4) | * Cairo\n* Johannesburg\n* Kinshasa\n* Lagos\n |\n| Asia (35) | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Tokyo Station is the main intercity rail terminal in Tokyo.\n![](image)Haneda Airport\n![](image)Tokyo Metro and Toei Subway are two main subway operators in Tokyo.\n![](image)Hamazakibashi JCT in Shuto Expressway\nTokyo, which is the center of the Greater Tokyo Area, is Japan's largest domestic and international hub for rail and ground transportation. Public transportation within Tokyo is dominated by an extensive network of \"clean and efficient\"[110] trains and subways run by a variety of operators, with buses, monorails and trams playing a secondary feeder role. There are up to 62 electric train lines and more than 900 train stations in Tokyo.[111] Shibuya Crossing is the \"world's busiest pedestrian crossing\", with around 3,000 people crossing at a time.[112][113][114]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![](image) Toshima | 豊島区 | Toshima-ku | Toshima Ward(after Toshima District) | 294,673 | 13116\n |\n| ![](image) Akiruno | あきる野市 | Akiruno-shi | Akiruno City\n | 80,464 | 13228\n |\n| ![](image) Akishima | 昭島市 | Akishima-shi | Akishima City\n | 111,449 | 13207\n |\n| ![](image) Chōfu | 調布市 | Chōfu-shi | Chōfu City\n | 240,668 | 13208\n |\n| ![](image) Fuchū | 府中市 | Fuchū-shi | Fuchū City(provincial capital city) | 260,891 | 13206\n |\n| ![](image) Fussa | 福生市 | Fussa-shi | Fussa City\n | 58,393 | 13218\n |\n| ![](image) Hachiōji | 八王子市 | Hachiōji-shi | Hachiōji City\n | 579,330 | 13201\n |\n| ![](image) Hamura | 羽村市 | Hamura-shi | Hamura City\n | 55,596 | 13227\n |\n| ![](image) Higashikurume | 東久留米市 | Higashi-Kurume-shi | Higashi-Kurume CityEast Kurume City(as opposed to Kurume City, Western Japan) | 116,869 | 13222\n |\n| ![](image) Higashimurayama | 東村山市 | Higashi-Murayama-shi | Higashi-Murayama CityEast Murayama City(after Murayama Region) | 150,984 | 13213\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLand reclamation projects in Tokyo have also been going on for centuries. The most prominent is the Odaiba area, now a major shopping and entertainment center. Various plans have been proposed[40] for transferring national government functions from Tokyo to secondary capitals in other regions of Japan, to slow down rapid development in Tokyo and revitalize economically lagging areas of the country. These plans have been controversial[41] within Japan and have yet to be realized.\n\n\nThe 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami that devastated much of the northeastern coast of Honshu was felt in Tokyo. However, due to Tokyo's earthquake-resistant infrastructure, damage in Tokyo was very minor compared to areas directly hit by the tsunami,[42] although activity in the city was largely halted.[43] The subsequent nuclear crisis caused by the tsunami has also largely left Tokyo unaffected, despite occasional spikes in radiation levels.[44][45]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![](image) Hachijō | 八丈町 | Hachijō-machi | Hachijō Town(on Hachijō Island) | Hachijō | 7,516 | 13401\n |\n| ![](image) Aogashima | 青ヶ島村 | Aogashima-mura | Aogashima Village(on Aogashima) | 169 | 13402\n |\n| ![](image) Miyake | 三宅村 | Miyake-mura | Miyake Village(on Miyake Island) | Miyake | 2,451 | 13381\n |\n| ![](image) Mikurajima | 御蔵島村 | Mikurajima-mura | Mikurajima Village(Mikura Island Village)\n | 328 | 13382\n |\n| ![](image) Ōshima | 大島町 | Ōshima-machi | Ōshima Town([Izu] Grand Island Town) | Ōshima | 7,762 | 13361\n |\n| ![](image) To-shima | 利島村 | Toshima-mura | To-shima Village(on homonymous island) | 309 | 13362\n |\n| ![](image) Niijima | 新島村 | Niijima-mura | Niijima Village(on homonymous island) | 2,697 | 13363\n |\n| ![](image) Kōzushima | 神津島村 | Kōzushima-mura | Kōzushima Village(on homonymous island) | 1,856 | 13364\n |\n| ![](image) Ogasawara | 小笠原村 | Ogasawara-mura | Ogasawara Village(on homonymous islands) | Ogasawara | 3,029 | 13421\n |\n| ![](image) Tokyo\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Hokkaidō | * Hokkaido\n |\n| Tōhoku | * Aomori\n* Iwate\n* Miyagi\n* Akita\n* Yamagata\n* Fukushima\n |\n| Kantō | * Ibaraki\n* Tochigi\n* Gunma\n* Saitama\n* Chiba\n* Tokyo\n* Kanagawa\n |\n| Chūbu | * Niigata\n* Toyama\n* Ishikawa\n* Fukui\n* Yamanashi\n* Nagano\n* Gifu\n* Shizuoka\n* Aichi\n |\n| Kansai | * Mie\n* Shiga\n* Kyoto\n* Osaka\n* Hyōgo\n* Nara\n* Wakayama\n |\n| Chūgoku | * Tottori\n* Shimane\n* Okayama\n* Hiroshima\n* Yamaguchi\n |\n| Shikoku | * Tokushima\n* Kagawa\n* Ehime\n* Kōchi\n |\n| Kyūshū | * Fukuoka\n* Saga\n* Nagasaki\n* Kumamoto\n* Ōita\n* Miyazaki\n* Kagoshima\n* Okinawa\n |\n\n |\n| * Category\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMetropolitan cities of Japan\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAccording to *Around the Rings*, the gymnasium has played host to the October 2011 artistic gymnastics world championships, despite the International Gymnastics Federation's initial doubt in Tokyo's ability to host the championships following the March 11 tsunami.[122] Tokyo was also selected to host a number of games for the 2019 Rugby World Cup, and to host the 2020 Summer Olympics and the Paralympics which had to be rescheduled to the summer of 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan.\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTokyo contains numerous parks and gardens.

Governor Shintaro Ishihara created Japan's first emissions cap system, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emission by a total of 25% by 2020 from the 2000 level.[89] Tokyo is an example of an urban heat island, and the phenomenon is especially serious in its special wards.[90][91] According to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government,[92] the annual mean temperature has increased by about 3 °C (5.4 °F) over the past 100 years. Tokyo has been cited as a \"convincing example of the relationship between urban growth and climate\".[90]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)A satellite photo of Tokyo in 2018 taken by ESA Sentinel-2\n![](image)The Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building\nThe mainland portion of Tokyo lies northwest of Tokyo Bay and measures about 90 km (56 mi) east to west and 25 km (16 mi) north to south. The average elevation in Tokyo is 40 m (131 ft).[49] Chiba Prefecture borders it to the east, Yamanashi to the west, Kanagawa to the south, and Saitama to the north. Mainland Tokyo is further subdivided into the special wards (occupying the eastern half) and the Tama area (多摩地域) stretching westwards. Tokyo has a latitude of 35.65 (near the 36th parallel north), which makes it more southern than Rome (41.90), Madrid (40.41), New York City (40.71) and Beijing (39.91).[50]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n19. **^** Fiévé, Nicolas & Paul Waley (2003). *Japanese Capitals in Historical Perspective: Place, Power and Memory in Kyoto, Edo and Tokyo*. p. 253.\n20. **^** 明治東京異聞～トウケイかトウキョウか～東京の読み方 (in Japanese).

The special wards use the word \"city\" in their official English name (e.g. Chiyoda City). The wards differ from other cities in having a unique administrative relationship with the prefectural government. Certain municipal functions, such as waterworks, sewerage, and fire-fighting, are handled by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. To pay for the added administrative costs, the prefecture collects municipal taxes, which would usually be levied by the city.[53] The \"three central wards\" of Tokyo – Chiyoda, Chūō and Minato – are the business core of the city, with a daytime population more than seven times higher than their nighttime population.[54] Chiyoda Ward is unique in that it is in the very heart of the former Tokyo City, yet is one of the least populated wards. It is occupied by many major Japanese companies and is also the seat of the national government, and the Japanese emperor. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n60. **^** \"General overview of area figures for Natural Parks by prefecture\" (PDF).

Since then, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government served as both the prefecture government for Tokyo, as well as administering the special wards of Tokyo, for what had previously been Tokyo City. World War II wreaked widespread destruction of most of the city due to the persistent Allied air raids on Japan and the use of incendiary bombs. The bombing of Tokyo in 1944 and 1945 is estimated to have killed between 75,000 and 200,000 civilians and left more than half of the city destroyed.[29]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_APsU221vZBrlVMc6m86CKKzs","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Although the port is run by the Shanghai International Port Group under the government of Shanghai, it administratively belongs to Shengsi County, Zhejiang.[265]\n\n\nOvertaking the Port of Singapore in 2010,[266] the Port of Shanghai has become world's busiest container port with an annual TEU transportation of 42 million in 2018.[267] Besides cargo, the Port of Shanghai handled 259 cruises and 1.89 million passengers in 2019.[142]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs of 2019[update], the Shanghai Stock Exchange had a market capitalization of US$4.02 trillion, making it the largest stock exchange in China and the fourth-largest stock exchange in the world.[152] In 2009, the trading volume of six key commodities—including rubber, copper, and zinc—on the Shanghai Futures Exchange all ranked first globally.[153] By the end of 2017, Shanghai had 1,491 financial institutions, of which 251 were foreign-invested.[154]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  • Body | Shanghai Municipal People's Congress |\n|  • CCP Secretary | Chen Jining |\n|  • Congress Chairman | *vacant* |\n|  • Mayor | Gong Zheng |\n|  • Municipal CPPCC Chairman | Hu Wenrong |\n|  • National People's Congress Representation | 57 deputies |\n| Area[5][6][7]\n |\n|  • Municipality | 6,341 km2 (2,448 sq mi) |\n|  • Water | 697 km2 (269 sq mi) |\n|  • Metro | 14,922.7 km2 (5,761.7 sq mi) |\n| Elevation[8]\n | 4 m (13 ft) |\n| Highest elevation(Sheshan Hill)\n | 118 m (387 ft) |\n| Population(2022)[9]\n |\n|  • Municipality | 26,875,500 |\n|  • Rank | 1st in China |\n|  • Density | 4,200/km2 (11,000/sq mi) |\n|  • Metro[10]\n | 40,000,000 |\n|  • Metro density | 2,700/km2 (6,900/sq mi) |\n| Demonym | Shanghainese |\n| Time zone | UTC+08:00 (CST) |\n| Postal code | **2000**00–**2021**00\n |\n| Area code | 21 |\n| ISO 3166 code | CN-SH |\n| GDP[11] | 2022 |\n|  – Total | ¥4.465 trillion (11th)$663.874 billion (nominal)\n $1.090 trillion (PPP)[12] |\n|  – Per capita | ¥179,538 (2nd)$26,747 (nominal)[13] $43,833 (PPP)[14] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n**Chongming**\n |\n| Division code[118] | Division\n | Area (km2)[119] | Total population 2020[119] | Seat\n | Postal code\n |\n| 310000 | Shanghai\n | 6,340.50 | 24,870,895 | Huangpu | 200000\n |\n| 310101 | Huangpu | 20.46 | 662,030 | Waitan Subdistrict | 200001\n |\n| 310104 | Xuhui | 54.76 | 1,113,078 | Xujiahui Subdistrict | 200030\n |\n| 310105 | Changning | 38.30 | 693,051 | Jiangsu Road Subdistrict | 200050\n |\n| 310106 | Jing'an | 36.88 | 975,707 | Jiangning Road Subdistrict | 200040\n |\n| 310107 | Putuo | 54.83 | 1,239,800 | Zhenru Town Subdistrict | 200333\n |\n| 310109 | Hongkou | 23.46 | 757,498 | Jiaxing Road Subdistrict | 200080\n |\n| 310110 | Yangpu | 60.73 | 1,242,548 | Pingliang Road Subdistrict | 200082\n |\n| 310112 | Minhang | 370.75 | 2,653,489 | Xinzhuang town | 201100\n |\n| 310113 | Baoshan | 270.99 | 2,235,218 | Youyi Road Subdistrict | 201900\n |\n| 310114 | Jiading | 464.20 | 1,834,258 | Xincheng Road Subdistrict | 201800\n |\n| 310115 | Pudong | 1,210.41 | 5,681,512 | Huamu Subdistrict | 200135\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| National Central Cities | * Beijinga\n* Chongqinga\n* Guangzhoub2\n* Shanghaia2\n* Tianjina2\n |\n| Special administrative regions | * Hong Kong\n* Macau\n |\n| Regional Central Cities | * Chengdub\n* Nanjingb\n* Shenyangb\n* Shenzhenc1\n* Wuhanb\n* Xi'anb\n |\n| Sub-provincial cities | * Changchunb\n* Chengdub\n* Dalianc2\n* Guangzhoub2\n* Hangzhoub\n* Harbinb\n* Jinanb\n* Nanjingb\n* Ningboc2\n* Qingdaoc2\n* Shenyangb\n* Shenzhenc1\n* Wuhanb\n* Xiamenc1\n* Xi'anb\n |\n| Provincial capitals(Prefecture-level) | * Changsha\n* Fuzhou2\n* Guiyang\n* Haikou\n* Hefei\n* Kunming\n* Lanzhou\n* Nanchang\n* Shijiazhuang\n* Taiyuan\n* Xining\n* Zhengzhou\n* *Taibei*5\n |\n| Autonomous regional capitals | * Hohhot\n* Lhasa\n* Nanning\n* Ürümqi\n* Yinchuan\n |\n| Comparatively large cities | * Anshan\n* Baotou\n* Benxi\n* Datong\n* Fushun\n* Jiujiang\n* Handan\n* Huainan\n* Jilin\n* Luoyang\n* Qiqihar\n* Suzhou\n* Tangshan\n* Wuxi\n* Xuzhou\n* Zibo\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Prefecture-level cities by province\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nShanghai has a life expectancy of 83.18 years for the city's registered population,[175] the highest life expectancy of all cities in mainland China.

The city was one of five treaty ports forced to open to European trade after the First Opium War. The Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession were subsequently established. The city then flourished, becoming a primary commercial and financial hub of Asia in the 1930s. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the city was the site of the major Battle of Shanghai. After the war, with the CCP takeover of the mainland in 1949, trade was limited to other socialist countries and the city's global influence declined.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_aXfBORhe3pKqCIt0Qtf1lCxh","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

After localized lockdowns failed to stem the rise in cases, the Chinese government locked down the entire city on 5 April. This resulted in widespread food shortages across the city emerged as food-supply chains were severely disrupted by the government's lockdown measures, which was not lifted until 1 June.[72]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Shanghai\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince its opening, the Port of Shanghai has rapidly grown to become the largest port in China.[264] Yangshan Port was built in 2005 because the river was unsuitable for docking large container ships. The port is connected with the mainland through the 32-kilometer (20 mi) long Donghai Bridge. Although the port is run by the Shanghai International Port Group under the government of Shanghai, it administratively belongs to Shengsi County, Zhejiang.[265]\n\n\nOvertaking the Port of Singapore in 2010,[266] the Port of Shanghai has become world's busiest container port with an annual TEU transportation of 42 million in 2018.[267] Besides cargo, the Port of Shanghai handled 259 cruises and 1.89 million passengers in 2019.[142]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs of 2019[update], the Shanghai Stock Exchange had a market capitalization of US$4.02 trillion, making it the largest stock exchange in China and the fourth-largest stock exchange in the world.[152] In 2009, the trading volume of six key commodities—including rubber, copper, and zinc—on the Shanghai Futures Exchange all ranked first globally.[153] By the end of 2017, Shanghai had 1,491 financial institutions, of which 251 were foreign-invested.[154]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  • Body | Shanghai Municipal People's Congress |\n|  • CCP Secretary | Chen Jining |\n|  • Congress Chairman | *vacant* |\n|  • Mayor | Gong Zheng |\n|  • Municipal CPPCC Chairman | Hu Wenrong |\n|  • National People's Congress Representation | 57 deputies |\n| Area[5][6][7]\n |\n|  • Municipality | 6,341 km2 (2,448 sq mi) |\n|  • Water | 697 km2 (269 sq mi) |\n|  • Metro | 14,922.7 km2 (5,761.7 sq mi) |\n| Elevation[8]\n | 4 m (13 ft) |\n| Highest elevation(Sheshan Hill)\n | 118 m (387 ft) |\n| Population(2022)[9]\n |\n|  • Municipality | 26,875,500 |\n|  • Rank | 1st in China |\n|  • Density | 4,200/km2 (11,000/sq mi) |\n|  • Metro[10]\n | 40,000,000 |\n|  • Metro density | 2,700/km2 (6,900/sq mi) |\n| Demonym | Shanghainese |\n| Time zone | UTC+08:00 (CST) |\n| Postal code | **2000**00–**2021**00\n |\n| Area code | 21 |\n| ISO 3166 code | CN-SH |\n| GDP[11] | 2022 |\n|  – Total | ¥4.465 trillion (11th)$663.874 billion (nominal)\n $1.090 trillion (PPP)[12] |\n|  – Per capita | ¥179,538 (2nd)$26,747 (nominal)[13] $43,833 (PPP)[14] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n**Chongming**\n |\n| Division code[118] | Division\n | Area (km2)[119] | Total population 2020[119] | Seat\n | Postal code\n |\n| 310000 | Shanghai\n | 6,340.50 | 24,870,895 | Huangpu | 200000\n |\n| 310101 | Huangpu | 20.46 | 662,030 | Waitan Subdistrict | 200001\n |\n| 310104 | Xuhui | 54.76 | 1,113,078 | Xujiahui Subdistrict | 200030\n |\n| 310105 | Changning | 38.30 | 693,051 | Jiangsu Road Subdistrict | 200050\n |\n| 310106 | Jing'an | 36.88 | 975,707 | Jiangning Road Subdistrict | 200040\n |\n| 310107 | Putuo | 54.83 | 1,239,800 | Zhenru Town Subdistrict | 200333\n |\n| 310109 | Hongkou | 23.46 | 757,498 | Jiaxing Road Subdistrict | 200080\n |\n| 310110 | Yangpu | 60.73 | 1,242,548 | Pingliang Road Subdistrict | 200082\n |\n| 310112 | Minhang | 370.75 | 2,653,489 | Xinzhuang town | 201100\n |\n| 310113 | Baoshan | 270.99 | 2,235,218 | Youyi Road Subdistrict | 201900\n |\n| 310114 | Jiading | 464.20 | 1,834,258 | Xincheng Road Subdistrict | 201800\n |\n| 310115 | Pudong | 1,210.41 | 5,681,512 | Huamu Subdistrict | 200135\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| National Central Cities | * Beijinga\n* Chongqinga\n* Guangzhoub2\n* Shanghaia2\n* Tianjina2\n |\n| Special administrative regions | * Hong Kong\n* Macau\n |\n| Regional Central Cities | * Chengdub\n* Nanjingb\n* Shenyangb\n* Shenzhenc1\n* Wuhanb\n* Xi'anb\n |\n| Sub-provincial cities | * Changchunb\n* Chengdub\n* Dalianc2\n* Guangzhoub2\n* Hangzhoub\n* Harbinb\n* Jinanb\n* Nanjingb\n* Ningboc2\n* Qingdaoc2\n* Shenyangb\n* Shenzhenc1\n* Wuhanb\n* Xiamenc1\n* Xi'anb\n |\n| Provincial capitals(Prefecture-level) | * Changsha\n* Fuzhou2\n* Guiyang\n* Haikou\n* Hefei\n* Kunming\n* Lanzhou\n* Nanchang\n* Shijiazhuang\n* Taiyuan\n* Xining\n* Zhengzhou\n* *Taibei*5\n |\n| Autonomous regional capitals | * Hohhot\n* Lhasa\n* Nanning\n* Ürümqi\n* Yinchuan\n |\n| Comparatively large cities | * Anshan\n* Baotou\n* Benxi\n* Datong\n* Fushun\n* Jiujiang\n* Handan\n* Huainan\n* Jilin\n* Luoyang\n* Qiqihar\n* Suzhou\n* Tangshan\n* Wuxi\n* Xuzhou\n* Zibo\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Prefecture-level cities by province\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nShanghai has a life expectancy of 83.18 years for the city's registered population,[175] the highest life expectancy of all cities in mainland China.

The city was one of five treaty ports forced to open to European trade after the First Opium War. The Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession were subsequently established. The city then flourished, becoming a primary commercial and financial hub of Asia in the 1930s. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the city was the site of the major Battle of Shanghai. After the war, with the CCP takeover of the mainland in 1949, trade was limited to other socialist countries and the city's global influence declined.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_aXfBORhe3pKqCIt0Qtf1lCxh","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Listed by the GaWC as an alpha global city, São Paulo is the most populous city outside of Asia and the world's 4th largest city proper by population. Additionally, São Paulo is the largest Portuguese-speaking city in the world. It exerts strong international influences in commerce, finance, arts and entertainment.[8] The city's name honors the Apostle, Saint Paul of Tarsus. The city's metropolitan area, the Greater São Paulo, ranks as the most populous in Brazil and the 12th most populous on Earth. The process of conurbation between the metropolitan areas around the Greater São Paulo (Campinas, Santos, Jundiaí, Sorocaba and São José dos Campos) created the São Paulo Macrometropolis,[9] a megalopolis with more than 30 million inhabitants, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** \"Cidade de São Paulo | Secretaria de Relações Internacionais Prefeitura da Cidade de São Paulo\". *Prefeitura.sp.gov.br* (in Brazilian Portuguese).

São Paulo is Brazil's highest GDP city and one of the largest in the world,[138][139]\n\n\nAccording to data from the IBGE, its gross domestic product (GDP) in 2010 was R$450 billion,[140] approximately\nUS$220 billion, 12.26% of Brazilian GDP and 36% of all production of goods and services of the State of São Paulo.[141]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSuch tissue heterogeneity, however, is not as predictable as the generic model can make us imagine. Some central regions of the city began to concentrate indigents, drug trafficking, street vending and prostitution, which encouraged the creation of new socio-economic centralities. The characterization of each region of the city also underwent several changes throughout the 20th century. With the relocation of industries to other cities or states, several areas that once housed factory sheds have become commercial or even residential areas.[176]\n\n\nSão Paulo has a history of actions, projects and plans related to urban planning that can be traced to the governments of Antonio da Silva Prado, Baron Duprat, Washington and Luis Francisco Prestes Maia. However, in general, the city was formed during the 20th century, growing from village to metropolis through a series of informal processes and irregular urban sprawl.[177]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSão Paulo has a myriad of urban fabrics. The original nuclei of the city are vertical, characterized by the presence of commercial buildings and services; And the peripheries are generally developed with two to four-story buildings – although such generalization certainly meets with exceptions in the fabric of the metropolis. Compared to other global cities (such as the island cities of New York City and Hong Kong), however, São Paulo is considered a \"low-rise building\" city. Its tallest buildings rarely reach forty stories, and the average residential building is twenty. Nevertheless, it is the fourth city in the world in quantity of buildings, according to the page specialized in research of data on buildings *Emporis Buildings*,[174] besides possessing what was considered until 2014 the tallest skyscraper of the country, the Mirante do Vale, also known as *Palácio Zarzur Kogan*, with 170 meters of height and 51 floors.[175]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n161. **^** \"Parada Gay é evento que atrai mais turistas a SP, diz SPTuris\" (in Portuguese).

The new job vacancies contributed to attract a significant number of immigrants (mainly from Italy)[171] and migrants, especially from the Northeastern states.[172] From a population of only 32.000 people in 1880, São Paulo now had 8.5 million inhabitants in 1980.

This migration grew enormously in the 1930s and remained huge in the next decades. The concentration of land, modernization in rural areas, changes in work relationships and cycles of droughts stimulated migration. Northeastern migrants live mainly in hazardous and unhealthy areas of the city, in cortiços *(\"guettos\")*, in favelas *(\"slums\")* of the metropolis, because they offer cheaper housing. The largest concentration of northeastern migrants was found in the area of Sé/Brás (districts of Brás, Bom Retiro, Cambuci, Pari and Sé). In this area they composed 41% of the population.[106][*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Metropolitan area[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Greater São Paulo and São Paulo Macrometropolis\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n131. **^** \"São Paulo, da taipa ao concreto\".

Favelas went back into the urban perimeter, occupying the small lots not yet occupied by urbanization – alongside polluted rivers, railways, or between bridges.[184] By 1993, 19.8% of São Paulo's population lived in favelas, compared to 5.2% in 1980.[185] Today, it is estimated that 2.1 million Paulistas live in favelas, which represents about 11% of the metropolitan area's population.[186]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nPanoramic view of Central Zone of São Paulo from Italy Building\n\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Transport in São Paulo and Transport in Brazil\n\n#### Roads[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nBandeirantes Highway/SP-348\n![](image)\nMario Covas Beltway\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n167. **^** \"Paris ties with Vienna as top conference city in ICCA rankings\".

The city consumes an average of 221 liters of water/inhabitant/day while the UN recommends the consumption of 110 liters/day. The water loss is 30.8%. However, between 11 and 12.8% of households do not have a sewage system, depositing waste in pits and ditches. Sixty percent of the sewage collected is treated. According to data from IBGE and Eletropaulo, the electricity grid serves almost 100% of households. The fixed telephony network is still precarious, with coverage of 67.2%. Household garbage collection covers all regions of the municipality but is still insufficient, reaching around 94% of the demand in districts such as Parelheiros and Perus. About 80% of the garbage produced daily by Paulistas is exported to other cities, such as Caieiras and Guarulhos.[173] Recycling accounts for about 1% of the 15,000 metric tons of waste produced daily.[173]\n\n\n\n### Urban planning[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* ABCD Region\n* Japanese cuisine in São Paulo\n* Large Cities Climate Leadership Group\n* Largest cities in the Americas\n* List of municipalities in the state of São Paulo by population\n* OPENCities\n* Caminhada Noturna (night walk)\n* Department of Historic Heritage of São Paulo\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Bibliography[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Bibliography of the history of São Paulo\n\n* Lawrence, Rachel (January 2010).

It increased by 31% in two years, and doubled in 20 years.[115]\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Brazil\n\nThe primary language is Portuguese. The general language from São Paulo General, or Tupi Austral (Southern Tupi), was the Tupi-based trade language of what is now São Vicente, São Paulo, and the upper Tietê River. In the 17th century it was widely spoken in São Paulo and spread to neighboring regions while in Brazil. From 1750 on, following orders from Marquess of Pombal, Portuguese language was introduced through immigration and consequently taught to children in schools. The original Tupi Austral language subsequently lost ground to Portuguese, and eventually became extinct. Due to the large influx of Japanese, German, Spanish, Italian and Arab immigrants etc., the Portuguese idiom spoken in the metropolitan area of São Paulo reflects influences from those languages.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Jaraguá Peak is the highest point in the city, at 1,135 meters (3,724 ft).[28]\nSão Paulo is the capital of the most populous state in Brazil, São Paulo, located at latitude 23°33'01'' south and longitude 46°38'02'' west. The total area of the municipality is 1,521.11 square kilometres (587.30 sq mi), according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), being the ninth largest in the state in terms of territorial extension.[29] Of the entire area of the municipality, 949,611 square kilometres (366,647 sq mi) are urban areas (2015), being the largest urban area in the country.[30]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe problem of balanced water supply for the city - and for the metropolis, in general - is also a worrying issue: São Paulo has few sources of water in its own perimeter, having to seek it in distant hydrographic basins. The problem of water pollution is also aggravated by the irregular occupation of watershed areas, caused by urban expansion, driven by the difficulty of access to land and housing in central areas by the low-income population[55] and associated with real estate speculation and precariousness in new subdivisions. With this, there is also an overvaluation of individual transport over public transport – leading to the current rate of more than one vehicle for every two inhabitants and aggravating the problem of environmental pollution.[56]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)\nTietê River, one of the most polluted in the city\n![](image)\nSmog seen on the horizon of the Ibirapuera region\n\nAir pollution in some districts of the city exceeds local standards, mainly due to car traffic.[47] The World Health Organization (WHO) sets a limit of 20 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter of air as a safe annual average. In an assessment carried out by the WHO among over a thousand cities around the world in 2011, the city of São Paulo was ranked 268th among the most polluted, with an average rate of 38 micrograms per cubic meter, a rate well above the limit imposed by the organization, but lower than in other Brazilian cities, such as Rio de Janeiro (64 micrograms per cubic meter).[48] A 2013 study found that air pollution in the city causes more deaths than traffic accidents.[49][50]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSão Paulo also is home of the largest Japanese community outside Japan.[102] In 1958 the census counted 120,000 Japanese in the city and by 1987, there were 326,000 with another 170,000 in the surrounding areas within São Paulo state.[103] As of 2007, the Paulistano Japanese population outnumbered their fellow diaspora in the entirety of Peru, and in all individual American cities.[103]\n\n\nResearch conducted by the University of São Paulo (USP) shows the city's high ethnic diversity: when asked if they are \"descendants of foreign immigrants\", 81% of the students reported \"yes\". The main reported ancestries were: Italian (30.5%), Portuguese (23%), Spanish (14%), Japanese (8%), German (6%), *Brazilian* (4%), African (3%), Arab (2%) and Jewish (1%).[104]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe municipal government operates public health facilities across the city's territory, with 770 primary health care units (UBS), ambulatory and emergency clinics and 17 hospitals.

The UN pointed to São Paulo as an example of how big cities can reduce crime. Crime rates, such as homicide, have been steadily declining for 8 years. The number of murders in 2007 was 63% lower than in 1999. Carandiru's 9th DP is considered one of the five best police stations in the world and the best in Latin America.\n\n\nIn 2008, the city of São Paulo ranked 493rd in the list of the most violent cities in Brazil.

São Paulo's main economic activities derive from the services industry – factories are since long gone, and in came financial services institutions, law firms, consulting firms. Old factory buildings and warehouses still dot the landscape in neighborhoods such as Barra Funda and Brás. Some cities around São Paulo, such as Diadema, São Bernardo do Campo, Santo André, and Cubatão are still heavily industrialized to the present day, with factories producing from cosmetics to chemicals to automobiles.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n114. **^** Martins, Lourdes Conceição; Latorre, Maria do Rosário Dias de Oliveira; Saldiva, Paulo Paulo Hilário Nascimento; Braga, Alfésio Luís Ferreira (5 January 1996). \"Vehicular Restriction in SP\". *Revista Brasileira de Epidemiologia*. **4** (3): 220–229. doi:10.1590/S1415-790X2001000300008.

Additionally, São Paulo is the largest Portuguese-speaking city in the world. It exerts strong international influences in commerce, finance, arts and entertainment.[8] The city's name honors the Apostle, Saint Paul of Tarsus. The city's metropolitan area, the Greater São Paulo, ranks as the most populous in Brazil and the 12th most populous on Earth. The process of conurbation between the metropolitan areas around the Greater São Paulo (Campinas, Santos, Jundiaí, Sorocaba and São José dos Campos) created the São Paulo Macrometropolis,[9] a megalopolis with more than 30 million inhabitants, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** \"Cidade de São Paulo | Secretaria de Relações Internacionais Prefeitura da Cidade de São Paulo\". *Prefeitura.sp.gov.br* (in Brazilian Portuguese).

São Paulo is Brazil's highest GDP city and one of the largest in the world,[138][139]\n\n\nAccording to data from the IBGE, its gross domestic product (GDP) in 2010 was R$450 billion,[140] approximately\nUS$220 billion, 12.26% of Brazilian GDP and 36% of all production of goods and services of the State of São Paulo.[141]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSuch tissue heterogeneity, however, is not as predictable as the generic model can make us imagine. Some central regions of the city began to concentrate indigents, drug trafficking, street vending and prostitution, which encouraged the creation of new socio-economic centralities. The characterization of each region of the city also underwent several changes throughout the 20th century. With the relocation of industries to other cities or states, several areas that once housed factory sheds have become commercial or even residential areas.[176]\n\n\nSão Paulo has a history of actions, projects and plans related to urban planning that can be traced to the governments of Antonio da Silva Prado, Baron Duprat, Washington and Luis Francisco Prestes Maia. However, in general, the city was formed during the 20th century, growing from village to metropolis through a series of informal processes and irregular urban sprawl.[177]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSão Paulo has a myriad of urban fabrics. The original nuclei of the city are vertical, characterized by the presence of commercial buildings and services; And the peripheries are generally developed with two to four-story buildings – although such generalization certainly meets with exceptions in the fabric of the metropolis. Compared to other global cities (such as the island cities of New York City and Hong Kong), however, São Paulo is considered a \"low-rise building\" city. Its tallest buildings rarely reach forty stories, and the average residential building is twenty. Nevertheless, it is the fourth city in the world in quantity of buildings, according to the page specialized in research of data on buildings *Emporis Buildings*,[174] besides possessing what was considered until 2014 the tallest skyscraper of the country, the Mirante do Vale, also known as *Palácio Zarzur Kogan*, with 170 meters of height and 51 floors.[175]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n161. **^** \"Parada Gay é evento que atrai mais turistas a SP, diz SPTuris\" (in Portuguese).

With the First and Second World Wars and the Great Depression, coffee exports to the United States and Europe were heavily affected, forcing the rich coffee growers to invest in the industrial activities that would make São Paulo the largest industrial center in Brazil. The new job vacancies contributed to attract a significant number of immigrants (mainly from Italy)[171] and migrants, especially from the Northeastern states.[172] From a population of only 32.000 people in 1880, São Paulo now had 8.5 million inhabitants in 1980.

This migration grew enormously in the 1930s and remained huge in the next decades. The concentration of land, modernization in rural areas, changes in work relationships and cycles of droughts stimulated migration. Northeastern migrants live mainly in hazardous and unhealthy areas of the city, in cortiços *(\"guettos\")*, in favelas *(\"slums\")* of the metropolis, because they offer cheaper housing.

Favelas went back into the urban perimeter, occupying the small lots not yet occupied by urbanization – alongside polluted rivers, railways, or between bridges.[184] By 1993, 19.8% of São Paulo's population lived in favelas, compared to 5.2% in 1980.[185] Today, it is estimated that 2.1 million Paulistas live in favelas, which represents about 11% of the metropolitan area's population.[186]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nPanoramic view of Central Zone of São Paulo from Italy Building\n\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Transport in São Paulo and Transport in Brazil\n\n#### Roads[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nBandeirantes Highway/SP-348\n![](image)\nMario Covas Beltway\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n167. **^** \"Paris ties with Vienna as top conference city in ICCA rankings\".

The city consumes an average of 221 liters of water/inhabitant/day while the UN recommends the consumption of 110 liters/day. The water loss is 30.8%. However, between 11 and 12.8% of households do not have a sewage system, depositing waste in pits and ditches. Sixty percent of the sewage collected is treated. According to data from IBGE and Eletropaulo, the electricity grid serves almost 100% of households. The fixed telephony network is still precarious, with coverage of 67.2%. Household garbage collection covers all regions of the municipality but is still insufficient, reaching around 94% of the demand in districts such as Parelheiros and Perus. About 80% of the garbage produced daily by Paulistas is exported to other cities, such as Caieiras and Guarulhos.[173] Recycling accounts for about 1% of the 15,000 metric tons of waste produced daily.[173]\n\n\n\n### Urban planning[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* ABCD Region\n* Japanese cuisine in São Paulo\n* Large Cities Climate Leadership Group\n* Largest cities in the Americas\n* List of municipalities in the state of São Paulo by population\n* OPENCities\n* Caminhada Noturna (night walk)\n* Department of Historic Heritage of São Paulo\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Bibliography[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Bibliography of the history of São Paulo\n\n* Lawrence, Rachel (January 2010).

The general language from São Paulo General, or Tupi Austral (Southern Tupi), was the Tupi-based trade language of what is now São Vicente, São Paulo, and the upper Tietê River. In the 17th century it was widely spoken in São Paulo and spread to neighboring regions while in Brazil. From 1750 on, following orders from Marquess of Pombal, Portuguese language was introduced through immigration and consequently taught to children in schools. The original Tupi Austral language subsequently lost ground to Portuguese, and eventually became extinct. Due to the large influx of Japanese, German, Spanish, Italian and Arab immigrants etc., the Portuguese idiom spoken in the metropolitan area of São Paulo reflects influences from those languages.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Jaraguá Peak is the highest point in the city, at 1,135 meters (3,724 ft).[28]\nSão Paulo is the capital of the most populous state in Brazil, São Paulo, located at latitude 23°33'01'' south and longitude 46°38'02'' west. The total area of the municipality is 1,521.11 square kilometres (587.30 sq mi), according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), being the ninth largest in the state in terms of territorial extension.[29] Of the entire area of the municipality, 949,611 square kilometres (366,647 sq mi) are urban areas (2015), being the largest urban area in the country.[30]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe problem of balanced water supply for the city - and for the metropolis, in general - is also a worrying issue: São Paulo has few sources of water in its own perimeter, having to seek it in distant hydrographic basins. The problem of water pollution is also aggravated by the irregular occupation of watershed areas, caused by urban expansion, driven by the difficulty of access to land and housing in central areas by the low-income population[55] and associated with real estate speculation and precariousness in new subdivisions. With this, there is also an overvaluation of individual transport over public transport – leading to the current rate of more than one vehicle for every two inhabitants and aggravating the problem of environmental pollution.[56]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)\nTietê River, one of the most polluted in the city\n![](image)\nSmog seen on the horizon of the Ibirapuera region\n\nAir pollution in some districts of the city exceeds local standards, mainly due to car traffic.[47] The World Health Organization (WHO) sets a limit of 20 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter of air as a safe annual average. In an assessment carried out by the WHO among over a thousand cities around the world in 2011, the city of São Paulo was ranked 268th among the most polluted, with an average rate of 38 micrograms per cubic meter, a rate well above the limit imposed by the organization, but lower than in other Brazilian cities, such as Rio de Janeiro (64 micrograms per cubic meter).[48] A 2013 study found that air pollution in the city causes more deaths than traffic accidents.[49][50]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSão Paulo also is home of the largest Japanese community outside Japan.[102] In 1958 the census counted 120,000 Japanese in the city and by 1987, there were 326,000 with another 170,000 in the surrounding areas within São Paulo state.[103] As of 2007, the Paulistano Japanese population outnumbered their fellow diaspora in the entirety of Peru, and in all individual American cities.[103]\n\n\nResearch conducted by the University of São Paulo (USP) shows the city's high ethnic diversity: when asked if they are \"descendants of foreign immigrants\", 81% of the students reported \"yes\".

Because of the lack of department stores and multi-brand boutiques, shopping malls as well as the Jardins district attract most of the world's luxurious brands. Most of the international luxury brands can be found in the Iguatemi, Cidade Jardim or JK shopping malls or on the streets of Oscar Freire, Lorena or Haddock Lobo in the Jardins district. They are home of brands such as Cartier, Chanel, Dior, Giorgio Armani, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs, Tiffany & Co. Cidade Jardim was opened in São Paulo in 2008, it is a 45,000-square-meter (484,376-square-foot) mall, landscaped with trees and greenery scenario, with a focus on Brazilian brands but also home to international luxury brands such as Hermès, Jimmy Choo, Pucci and Carolina Herrera.

São Paulo's main economic activities derive from the services industry – factories are since long gone, and in came financial services institutions, law firms, consulting firms. Old factory buildings and warehouses still dot the landscape in neighborhoods such as Barra Funda and Brás. Some cities around São Paulo, such as Diadema, São Bernardo do Campo, Santo André, and Cubatão are still heavily industrialized to the present day, with factories producing from cosmetics to chemicals to automobiles.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n114. **^** Martins, Lourdes Conceição; Latorre, Maria do Rosário Dias de Oliveira; Saldiva, Paulo Paulo Hilário Nascimento; Braga, Alfésio Luís Ferreira (5 January 1996). \"Vehicular Restriction in SP\". *Revista Brasileira de Epidemiologia*. **4** (3): 220–229. doi:10.1590/S1415-790X2001000300008.

Nonetheless, the annual rate of growth of the Metropolitan Area of Mexico City is much lower than that of other large urban agglomerations in Mexico,[114] a phenomenon most likely attributable to the environmental policy of decentralization.

Between 1960 and 1980 the city's population more than doubled to nearly 9 million.[53]\n\n\nIn 1980 half of all the industrial jobs in Mexico were located in Mexico City. Under relentless growth, the Mexico City government could barely keep up with services. Villagers from the countryside who continued to pour into the city to escape poverty only compounded the city's problems. With no housing available, they took over lands surrounding the city, creating huge shantytowns that extended for many miles.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The Mexico City Megalopolis as defined prior to 2019.

Air quality is poorest during the winter.\nBy the 1990s Mexico City had become infamous as one of the world's most polluted cities; however, the city has since become a model for drastically lowering pollution levels. By 2014 carbon monoxide pollution had dropped drastically, while sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide were at levels about a third of those in 1992. The levels of signature pollutants in Mexico City are similar to those of Los Angeles.[83] Despite the cleanup, the metropolitan area is still the most ozone-polluted part of the country, with ozone levels 2.5 times beyond WHO-defined safe limits.[84]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHistorically, and since Pre-Columbian times, the Valley of Anahuac has been one of the most densely populated areas in Mexico. When the Federal District was created in 1824, the urban area of Mexico City extended approximately to the area of today's Cuauhtémoc borough. At the beginning of the 20th century, the *elites* began migrating to the south and west and soon the small towns of Mixcoac and San Ángel were incorporated by the growing conurbation. According to the 1921 census, 54.78% of the city's population was considered Mestizo (Indigenous mixed with European), 22.79% considered European, and 18.74% considered Indigenous.[111] This was the last Mexican Census which asked people to self-identify with a heritage other than Amerindian. In 1921, Mexico City had less than one million inhabitants.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAdditionally, Mexico City is home to large communities of expatriates and immigrants from the rest of North America (U.S. and Canada), from South America (mainly from Argentina and Colombia, but also from Brazil, Chile, Uruguay and Venezuela), from Central America and the Caribbean (mainly from Cuba, Guatemala, El Salvador, Haiti and Honduras); from Europe (mainly from Spain, Germany and Switzerland, but also from Czech Republic, Hungary, France, Italy, Ireland, the Netherlands, Poland and Romania),[125][126] and from the Arab world (mostly from Lebanon, and other countries like Syria and Egypt).[127]\n\n\nMexico City is home to the largest population of Americans living outside the United States. Estimates are as high as 700,000 Americans living in Mexico City, while in 1999 the U.S. Bureau of Consular Affairs estimated over 440,000 Americans lived in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area.[128][129]\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBetween 2000 and 2004 an average of 478 crimes were reported each day in Mexico City; however, the actual crime rate is thought to be much higher \"since most people are reluctant to report crime\".[151] Under policies enacted by Mayor Marcelo Ebrard between 2009 and 2011, Mexico City underwent a major security upgrade with violent and petty crime rates both falling significantly despite the rise in violent crime in other parts of the country. Some of the policies enacted included the installation of 11,000 security cameras around the city and a very large expansion of the police force. Mexico City has one of the world's highest police officer-to-resident ratios, with one uniformed officer per 100 citizens.[152] Since 1997 the prison population has increased by more than 500%.[153] Political scientist Markus-Michael Müller argues that mostly informal street vendors are hit by these measures. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n157. **^** \"Acuerdos interinstitucionales registrados por dependencias y municipios de Ciudad de México\". *sre.gob.mx* (in Spanish).

Due to the limited non-urbanized space at the south—most of which is protected through environmental laws—the contribution of Mexico City in agriculture is the smallest of all federal entities in the country.[162] The economic reforms of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari had a tremendous effect on the city, as a number of businesses, including banks and airlines, were privatized. He also signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). This led to decentralization[166] and a shift in Mexico City's economic base, from manufacturing to services, as most factories moved away to either the State of Mexico, or more commonly to the northern border. By contrast, corporate office buildings set their base in the city.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* List of pre-columbian archaeological sites in Mexico City\n* List of colonial churches in Mexico City\n* List of colonial non-religious buildings in Mexico City\n* Cuisine of Mexico City\n* Six Flags México\n* Gentrification of Mexico City\n* Greater Mexico City\n* Historic center of Mexico City\n* Barrios Mágicos of Mexico City\n* Mesoamerican Codices\n* Large Cities Climate Leadership Group\n* Largest cities in the Americas\n* Metropolitan areas of Mexico\n* Outline of Mexico\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** In Peninsular Spanish, the spelling variant *Méjico*, is also used alongside *México*.

On average Mexico City sinks 20 inches (1 foot and 8 inches) or 50 centimetres (1/2 meters) every year.[81] This sinking is causing problems with runoff and wastewater management, leading to flooding problems, especially during the summer.[79][80][82] The entire lake bed is now paved over and most of the city's remaining forested areas lie in the southern boroughs of Milpa Alta, Tlalpan and Xochimilco.[80]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Mexico City geophysical maps\n |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Topography\n | Hydrology\n | Climate patterns\n |\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Water management in Greater Mexico City\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nSummer Olympic Games host cities\n |\n| --- |\n| * **1896:** ![Greece](image) Athens\n* **1900:** ![France](image) Paris\n* **1904:** ![United States](image) St. Louis\n* **1908:** ![United Kingdom](image) London\n* **1912:** ![Sweden](image) Stockholm\n* **1916:** *None*[c1]\n* **1920:** ![Belgium](image) Antwerp\n* **1924:** ![France](image) Paris\n* **1928:** ![Netherlands](image) Amsterdam\n* **1932:** ![United States](image) Los Angeles\n* **1936:** ![Germany](image) Berlin\n* **1940:** *None*[c2]\n* **1944:** *None*[c2]\n* **1948:** ![United Kingdom](image) London\n* **1952:** ![Finland](image) Helsinki\n* **1956:** ![Australia](image) Melbourne\n* **1960:** ![Italy](image) Rome\n* **1964:** ![Japan](image) Tokyo\n* **1968:** ![Mexico](image) Mexico City\n* **1972:** ![West Germany](image) Munich\n* **1976:** ![Canada](image) Montreal\n* **1980:** ![Soviet Union](image) Moscow\n* **1984:** ![United States](image) Los Angeles\n* **1988:** ![South Korea](image) Seoul\n* **1992:** ![Spain](image) Barcelona\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe politics pursued by the administrations of heads of government in Mexico City at the end of the 20th century have usually been more liberal than those of the rest of the country,[144][145] whether with the support of the federal government, as was the case with the approval of several comprehensive environmental laws in the 1980s, or by laws that were since approved by the Legislative Assembly. The Legislative Assembly expanded provisions on abortions, becoming the first federal entity to expand abortion in Mexico beyond cases of rape and economic reasons, to permit it at the choice of the mother before the 12th week of pregnancy.[146] In December 2009, the then Federal District became the first city in Latin America and one of very few in the world to legalize same-sex marriage.[147]\n\n\n\n### Boroughs and neighborhoods[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Boroughs of Mexico City and Neighborhoods in Mexico City\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEconomically, Mexico City prospered as a result of trade. Unlike Brazil or Peru, Mexico had easy contact with both the Atlantic and Pacific worlds. Although the Spanish crown tried to completely regulate all commerce in the city, it had only partial success.[59]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn contrast, the boroughs of Xochimilco (172nd), Tláhuac (177th), and Iztapalapa (183rd) presented the lowest HDI values of Mexico City, with values of 0.8481, 0.8473, and 0.8464, respectively, which are still in the global high-HDI range. The only borough that did not have a high HDI was that of rural Milpa Alta, which had a \"medium\" HDI of 0.7984, far below those of all the other boroughs (627th nationally, the rest being in the top 200). Mexico City's HDI for the 2005 report was 0.9012 (very high), and its 2010 value of 0.9225 (very high), or (by newer methodology) 0.8307, was Mexico's highest.[150]\n\n\n\n### Law enforcement[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Law enforcement in Mexico City\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe country hosted the FIFA World Cup in 1970 and 1986, and Azteca Stadium is the first stadium in World Cup history to host the final twice. The city will be one of the host cities for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.[201] Mexico City is the first Latin American city to host the Olympic Games, having held the Summer Olympics in 1968, winning bids against Buenos Aires, Lyon and Detroit. The city hosted the 1955 and 1975 Pan American Games, the latter after Santiago and São Paulo withdrew. The ICF Flatwater Racing World Championships were hosted here in 1974 and 1994. Lucha libre is a Mexican style of wrestling, and is one of the more popular sports throughout the country.

As the depth of the lake water fluctuated, Mexico City was subject to periodic flooding. A major labor draft, the *desagüe*, compelled thousands of indigenous over the colonial period to work on infrastructure to prevent flooding. Floods were not only an inconvenience but also a health hazard, since during flood periods human waste polluted the city's streets. By draining the area, the mosquito population dropped as did the frequency of the diseases they spread. However, draining the wetlands also changed the habitat for fish and birds and the areas accessible for indigenous cultivation close to the capital.[58] The 16th century saw a proliferation of churches, many of which can still be seen today in the historic center.[53]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n140. **^** Tavera Fenollosa, Ligia (3 March 2016). \"Eventful temporality and the unintended outcomes of Mexico's earthquake victims movement\".

Designed by the most prestigious architects of the era, including Mario Pani, Eugenio Peschard, and Enrique del Moral, the buildings feature murals by artists Diego Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros, and José Chávez Morado. It has since been recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[71]\n\n\nIn the 1950s Mexico City began to grow upwards, with the Torre Latinoamericana becoming the city's first skyscraper.[46] The 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City are memorable because they triggered one of the earliest anti-Olympic protests.[72]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe sees punishment \"related to the growing politicization of security and crime issues and the resulting criminalization of the people living at the margins of urban society, in particular those who work in the city's informal economy\".[153]\n\n\nIn 2016, the incidence of femicides was 3.2 per 100 000 inhabitants, the national average being 4.2.[154] A 2015 city government report found that two of three women over the age of 15 in the capital suffered some form of violence.[155] In addition to street harassment, one of the places where women in Mexico City are subjected to violence is on and around public transport. Annually the Metro of Mexico City receives 300 complaints of sexual harassment.[156] While the violence against women in Mexico City is rising, there is still a large number of incidents of kidnappings and killings that go undetected and unreported due to the corruption in the police department.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### International relations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Secretaría de Relaciones Exteriores – México\".

This was the case even though this government could not handle the population and pollution problems adequately. Nevertheless, discontent and protests began in the 1960s leading to the massacre of an unknown number of protesting students in Tlatelolco.[74]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1854 president Antonio López de Santa Anna enlarged the area of Mexico City almost eightfold from the original 220 to 1,700 km2 (80 to 660 sq mi), annexing the rural and mountainous areas to secure the strategic mountain passes to the south and southwest to protect the city in event of a foreign invasion. (The Mexican–American War had just been fought.) The last changes to the limits of Mexico City were made between 1898 and 1902, reducing the area to the current 1,479 km2 (571 sq mi) by adjusting the southern border with the state of Morelos. By that time, the total number of municipalities within Mexico City was twenty-two. In 1941, the General Anaya borough was merged with the Central Department, which was then renamed \"Mexico City\" (thus reviving the name but not the autonomous municipality). From 1941 to 1970, the Federal District comprised twelve *delegaciones* and Mexico City. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe World Bank has sponsored a project to curb air pollution through public transport improvements and the Mexican government has started shutting down polluting factories. They have phased out diesel buses and mandated new emission controls on new cars; since 1993 all new cars must be fitted with a catalytic converter, which reduces the emissions released. Trucks must use only liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Also construction of an underground rail system was begun in 1968 in order to help curb air pollution problems and alleviate traffic congestion. It has over 201 km (125 mi) of track and carries over 5 million people every day. Fees are kept low to encourage use of the system and during rush hours the crush is so great, that authorities have reserved a special carriage specifically for women. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIt is also a leading center of the advertising industry.

This valley is located in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt in the high plateaus of south-central Mexico.[77][78]\n\n\nIt has a minimum altitude of 2,200 meters (7,200 feet) above sea level and is surrounded by mountains and volcanoes that reach elevations of over 5,000 meters (16,000 feet).[79] This valley has no natural drainage outlet for the waters that flow from the mountainsides, making the city vulnerable to flooding. Drainage was engineered through the use of canals and tunnels starting in the 17th century.[77][79]\n\n\nMexico City primarily rests on what was Lake Texcoco.[77] Seismic activity is frequent there.[80] Lake Texcoco was drained starting from the 17th century. Although none of the lake waters remain, the city rests on the lake bed's heavily saturated clay. This soft base is collapsing due to the over-extraction of groundwater, called *groundwater-related subsidence*.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Ciudad de México* (Spanish)\n |\n| --- |\n| Capital and megacity\n |\n| ![](image)\nSkyline of Mexico City with the Torre Latinoamericana\n![](image)\nAngel of Independence\n![](image)\nMuseo Soumaya\n![](image)\nMonument to the Revolution\n![](image)\nPaseo de la Reforma from the Chapultepec Castle\n![](image)\nCathedral and the Zócalo\n![](image)\nPalace of Fine Arts\n![](image)\nSanta Fe business district\n |\n| \n![Coat of arms of Mexico City](image)Coat of arms\n![Official logo of Mexico City](image)Government logo\n |\n| Nickname: CDMX\n |\n| Motto(s): *La Ciudad de los Palacios**(The City of Palaces)*\n |\n| ![Mexico City within Mexico](image)Mexico City within Mexico\n |\n| ![Mexico City is located in Mexico](image)![Mexico City](image)\nMexico City\nLocation within Mexico\nShow map of Mexico\n![Mexico City is located in North America](image)![Mexico City](image)\nMexico City\nMexico City (North America)\nShow map of North America\n |\n| Coordinates: 19°26′N 99°8′W﻿ / ﻿19.433°N 99.133°W﻿ / 19.433; -99.133 |\n| Country | ![](image) Mexico |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn addition, according to the Secretariat of Tourism, the city has about 170 museums—is among the top ten of cities in the world with highest number of museums[173]—over 100 art galleries, and some 30 concert halls, all of which maintain a constant cultural activity during the whole year. Many areas (e.g. Palacio Nacional and the National Institute of Cardiology) have murals painted by Diego Rivera. He and his wife Frida Kahlo lived in Coyoacán, where several of their homes, studios, and art collections are open to the public. The house where Leon Trotsky was initially granted asylum and finally murdered in 1940 is also in Coyoacán. In addition, there are several *haciendas* that are now restaurants, such as the San Ángel Inn, the Hacienda de Tlalpan, Hacienda de Cortés and the Hacienda de los Morales.\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transportation in Mexico City\n\n### Airports[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTo clean up pollution, the federal and local governments implemented numerous plans including the constant monitoring and reporting of environmental conditions, such as ozone and nitrogen oxides.[85] When the levels of these two pollutants reached critical levels, contingency actions were implemented which included closing factories, changing school hours, and extending the *A day without a car* program to two days of the week.[85] The government also instituted industrial technology improvements, a strict biannual vehicle emission inspection and the reformulation of gasoline and diesel fuels.[85] The introduction of Metrobús bus rapid transit and the Ecobici bike-sharing were among efforts to encourage alternate, greener forms of transportation.[84]\n\n\n\n### Parks and recreation[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the colonial period, the city's motto was \"Muy Noble e Insigne, Muy Leal e Imperial\" (Very Noble and Distinguished, Very Loyal and Imperial).[32][33] During Andrés Manuel López Obrador's administration a political slogan was introduced: *la Ciudad de la Esperanza* (\"The City of Hope\"). This motto was quickly adopted as a city nickname but has faded since the new motto, *Capital en Movimiento* (\"Capital in Movement\"), was adopted by the administration headed by Marcelo Ebrard, though the latter is not treated as often as a nickname in media. \nUp until 2013, it was common to refer to the city by the initialism \n\"DF\" from \"Distrito Federal de México\". Since 2013, the abbreviation \"CDMX\" (Ciudad de México) has been more common, particularly in relation to government campaigns.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOther sports facilities in Mexico City are the Palacio de los Deportes indoor arena, Francisco Márquez Olympic Swimming Pool, the Hipódromo de Las Américas, the Agustin Melgar Olympic Velodrome, and venues for equestrianism and horse racing, ice hockey, rugby, American-style football, baseball, and basketball. Bullfighting takes place every Sunday during bullfighting season at the 50,000-seat Plaza México, the world's largest bullring. Mexico City's golf courses have hosted Women's LPGA action, and two Men's Golf World Cups. Courses throughout the city are available as private as well as public venues.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nAzteca Stadium\n![](image)\nUniversity Olympic Stadium\n![](image)\nSports City Stadium\n![](image)\nAlfredo Harp Helú Stadium\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Mexico portal\n* ![](image)Mesoamerica portal\n* ![map](image)Latin America portal\n* ![map](image)North America portal\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The Turibus runs through many of the most important tourist attractions in the city.\nMexico City is a destination for many foreign tourists. The Historic center of Mexico City (*Centro Histórico*) and the \"floating gardens\" of Xochimilco in the southern borough have been declared World Heritage Sites by UNESCO. Landmarks in the Historic Center include the Plaza de la Constitución (Zócalo), the main central square with its epoch-contrasting Spanish-era Metropolitan Cathedral and National Palace, ancient Aztec temple ruins Templo Mayor (\"Major Temple\") and modern structures, all within a few steps of one another. (The Templo Mayor was discovered in 1978 while workers were digging to place underground electric cables).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n177. **^** \"¿Cuántos autos circulan en la CDMX diariamente?\". *El Economista* (in Spanish).

When the Spaniards arrived, the Aztec Empire had reached much of Mesoamerica, touching both the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean.[45]\n\n\n\n### Spanish conquest[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Mexican President and later dictator Porfirio Díaz (second from right) commissioned many of the ornate European style buildings constructed from the 1890–1910 and hoped for Mexico City to eventually rival European cities like Paris in opulence.\nEvents such as the Mexican–American War, the French Intervention and the Reform War left the city relatively untouched and it continued to grow, especially during the rule of President Porfirio Díaz. During this time the city developed a modern infrastructure, such as roads, schools, transportation systems and communication systems. However the regime concentrated resources and wealth into the city while the rest of the country languished in poverty.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n41. **^** Karen Mutton (2011). *Scattered Skeleton in Our Closet*.

Since then, the whole Federal District, whose *delegaciones* had by then almost formed a single urban area, began to be considered *de facto* a synonym of Mexico City.[139]\n\n\nThe lack of a *de jure* stipulation left a legal vacuum that led to a number of sterile discussions about whether one concept had engulfed the other or if the latter had ceased to exist altogether. In 1993, the situation was solved by an amendment to the 44th article of the Constitution of Mexico; Mexico City and the Federal District were stated to be the same entity. The amendment was later introduced into the second article of the Statute of Government of the Federal District.[139]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAmong its many public and private schools (K–13), the city offers multi-cultural, multi-lingual and international schools attended by Mexican and foreign students. Best known are the Colegio Alemán (German school with three main campuses), the Liceo Mexicano Japonés (Japanese), the Centro Cultural Coreano en México (Korean), the Lycée Franco-Mexicain (French), the American School, The Westhill Institute (American School), the Edron Academy and the Greengates School (British). Mexico City joined the UNESCO Global Network of Learning Cities in 2015.[130]\n\n\nIn the Plaza de las Tres Culturas is the Colegio de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco that is recognized for being the first and oldest European school of higher learning in the Americas[131] and the first major school of interpreters and translators in the New World.[132] Other, the now-defunct Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico is considered the father of the UNAM, and it was located in the city and was the third oldest university in the Americas.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAssociation football is the country's most popular and most televised franchised sport. Its important venues in Mexico City include the Azteca Stadium, home to the Mexico national football team and giants América and Cruz Azul, which can seat 91,653 fans, making it the biggest stadium in Latin America. The Olympic Stadium in Ciudad Universitaria is home to the football club giants Universidad Nacional, with a seating capacity of over 52,000. The Sports City Stadium, which seats 33,042 fans, is near the World Trade Center Mexico City in the Nochebuena neighborhood, and is home to the historical Atlante. América, Cruz Azul and Universidad Nacional are based in Mexico City and play in the First Division; they are also part, with Guadalajara-based giants Club Deportivo Guadalajara, of Mexico's traditional \"Big Four\". \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Mexico City International Airport\nMexico City International Airport is Mexico City's primary airport (IATA Airport Code: MEX), and serves as the hub of Aeroméxico (Skyteam). Felipe Ángeles International Airport (IATA Airport Code: NLU) is Mexico City's secondary airport, and was opened in 2022, rebuilt from the former Santa Lucía Air Force Base. It is located in Zumpango, State of Mexico, 48.8 kilometres (30 mi) north-northeast of the historic center of Mexico City by car.[174]\n\n\n\n### Sistema de Movilidad Integrada[edit]\n\n\nIn 2019, the graphic designer Lance Wyman was engaged to create an integrated map of the multimodal public transportation system; he presented a new logo for the Sistema de Movilidad Integrada, describing eight distinct modes of transportation. The head of the government, Claudia Sheinbaum, said the branding would be used for a new single payment card to streamline public transportation fare collection.[175]\n\n\n\n### Metro[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe city is also a leading center of popular culture and music. There are a multitude of venues hosting Spanish and foreign-language performers. These include the 10,000-seat National Auditorium that regularly schedules the Spanish and English-language pop and rock artists, as well as many of the world's leading performing arts ensembles, the auditorium also broadcasts grand opera performances from New York's Metropolitan Opera on giant, high definition screens. In 2007 National Auditorium was selected world's best venue by multiple genre media. Other sites for pop-artist performances include the 3,000-seat Teatro Metropolitan, the 15,000-seat Palacio de los Deportes, and the larger 50,000-seat Foro Sol Stadium, where popular international artists perform on a regular basis. The Cirque du Soleil has held several seasons at the Carpa Santa Fe, in the Santa Fe district in the western part of the city. There are numerous venues for smaller musical ensembles and solo performers. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe city has also hosted several NBA pre-season games and has hosted international basketball's FIBA Americas Championship, along with north-of-the-border Major League Baseball exhibition games at Foro Sol. In 2017, NBA commissioner Adam Silver expressed interest in placing an NBA G League expansion team in Mexico City as early as 2018. This came to fruition on 12 December 2019 when commissioner Silver announced at a press conference in Mexico City Arena that LNBP team, Capitanes de Ciudad de México will be joining the G League in the 2020–21 season on a five-year agreement.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 29 January 2016, Mexico City ceased to be the *Federal District* (Spanish: *Distrito Federal* or D.F.), and was officially renamed \"Ciudad de México\" (or \"CDMX\").[28] On that date, Mexico City began a transition to becoming the country's 32nd federal entity, giving it a level of autonomy comparable to that of a state. It will have its own constitution and its legislature, and its *delegaciones* will now be headed by mayors.[28] Because of a clause in the Mexican Constitution, however, as it is the seat of the powers of the federation, it can never become a state, or the capital of the country has to be relocated elsewhere.[30]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_yHalADdQtJaLi44nyXTv32MM","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

The growth of the city has extended beyond the limits of the city to 59 municipalities of the State of Mexico and 1 in the state of Hidalgo.[112] With a population of approximately 19.8 million inhabitants (2008),[113] it is one of the most populous conurbations in the world. Nonetheless, the annual rate of growth of the Metropolitan Area of Mexico City is much lower than that of other large urban agglomerations in Mexico,[114] a phenomenon most likely attributable to the environmental policy of decentralization. The net migration rate of Mexico City from 1995 to 2000 was negative.[115]\n\n\n\n### Metropolitan area[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Greater Mexico City\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. **^** Agren, David (29 January 2016). \"Mexico City officially changes its name to – Mexico City\". *The Guardian*.

The city proper produces 15.8% of the country's gross domestic product.[162] In 2002, Mexico City had a Human Development Index score of 0.915,[163] identical to that of South Korea. In 2007, residents in the top twelve percent of GDP per capita holders in the city had a mean disposable income of US$98,517. The high spending power of Mexico City inhabitants makes the city attractive for companies offering prestige and luxury goods. According to a 2009 study conducted by PwC, Mexico City had a GDP of $390 billion, ranking it as the eighth richest city in the world and the richest in Latin America.[164] In 2009, Mexico City alone would rank as the 30th largest economy in the world.[165]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* **1996:** ![United States](image) Atlanta\n* **2000:** ![Australia](image) Sydney\n* **2004:** ![Greece](image) Athens\n* **2008:** ![China](image) Beijing\n* **2012:** ![United Kingdom](image) London\n* **2016:** ![Brazil](image) Rio de Janeiro\n* **2020:** ![Japan](image) Tokyo[c3]\n* ***2024:** ![France](image) Paris*\n* ***2028:** ![United States](image) Los Angeles*\n* ***2032:** ![Australia](image) Brisbane*\n |\n| [c1] Cancelled due to World War I; [c2] Cancelled due to World War II; [c3] Postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGreater Mexico City was the fastest growing metropolitan area in the country until the late 1980s. Since then, government policies have supported decentralization with the aim of reducing pollution in Greater Mexico City. While still growing, the annual rate of growth has decreased and is lower than that of Greater Guadalajara and Greater Monterrey.[114]\n\n\nThe net migration rate of Mexico City proper from 1995 to 2000 was negative,[118] which implies that residents are moving to the suburbs of the metropolitan area, or to other states of Mexico. In addition, some inner suburbs are losing population to outer suburbs, indicating the continuing expansion of Greater Mexico City.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nPanorama of Mexico City from Torre Latinoamericana\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n162. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Producto interno bruto por entidad federativa.

Between 1960 and 1980 the city's population more than doubled to nearly 9 million.[53]\n\n\nIn 1980 half of all the industrial jobs in Mexico were located in Mexico City. Under relentless growth, the Mexico City government could barely keep up with services. Villagers from the countryside who continued to pour into the city to escape poverty only compounded the city's problems. With no housing available, they took over lands surrounding the city, creating huge shantytowns that extended for many miles.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The Mexico City Megalopolis as defined prior to 2019.

Air quality is poorest during the winter.\nBy the 1990s Mexico City had become infamous as one of the world's most polluted cities; however, the city has since become a model for drastically lowering pollution levels. By 2014 carbon monoxide pollution had dropped drastically, while sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide were at levels about a third of those in 1992. The levels of signature pollutants in Mexico City are similar to those of Los Angeles.[83] Despite the cleanup, the metropolitan area is still the most ozone-polluted part of the country, with ozone levels 2.5 times beyond WHO-defined safe limits.[84]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHistorically, and since Pre-Columbian times, the Valley of Anahuac has been one of the most densely populated areas in Mexico. When the Federal District was created in 1824, the urban area of Mexico City extended approximately to the area of today's Cuauhtémoc borough. At the beginning of the 20th century, the *elites* began migrating to the south and west and soon the small towns of Mixcoac and San Ángel were incorporated by the growing conurbation. According to the 1921 census, 54.78% of the city's population was considered Mestizo (Indigenous mixed with European), 22.79% considered European, and 18.74% considered Indigenous.[111] This was the last Mexican Census which asked people to self-identify with a heritage other than Amerindian. In 1921, Mexico City had less than one million inhabitants.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAdditionally, Mexico City is home to large communities of expatriates and immigrants from the rest of North America (U.S. and Canada), from South America (mainly from Argentina and Colombia, but also from Brazil, Chile, Uruguay and Venezuela), from Central America and the Caribbean (mainly from Cuba, Guatemala, El Salvador, Haiti and Honduras); from Europe (mainly from Spain, Germany and Switzerland, but also from Czech Republic, Hungary, France, Italy, Ireland, the Netherlands, Poland and Romania),[125][126] and from the Arab world (mostly from Lebanon, and other countries like Syria and Egypt).[127]\n\n\nMexico City is home to the largest population of Americans living outside the United States. Estimates are as high as 700,000 Americans living in Mexico City, while in 1999 the U.S. Bureau of Consular Affairs estimated over 440,000 Americans lived in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area.[128][129]\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBetween 2000 and 2004 an average of 478 crimes were reported each day in Mexico City; however, the actual crime rate is thought to be much higher \"since most people are reluctant to report crime\".[151] Under policies enacted by Mayor Marcelo Ebrard between 2009 and 2011, Mexico City underwent a major security upgrade with violent and petty crime rates both falling significantly despite the rise in violent crime in other parts of the country. Some of the policies enacted included the installation of 11,000 security cameras around the city and a very large expansion of the police force. Mexico City has one of the world's highest police officer-to-resident ratios, with one uniformed officer per 100 citizens.[152] Since 1997 the prison population has increased by more than 500%.[153] Political scientist Markus-Michael Müller argues that mostly informal street vendors are hit by these measures. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n157. **^** \"Acuerdos interinstitucionales registrados por dependencias y municipios de Ciudad de México\". *sre.gob.mx* (in Spanish).

Due to the limited non-urbanized space at the south—most of which is protected through environmental laws—the contribution of Mexico City in agriculture is the smallest of all federal entities in the country.[162] The economic reforms of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari had a tremendous effect on the city, as a number of businesses, including banks and airlines, were privatized. He also signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). This led to decentralization[166] and a shift in Mexico City's economic base, from manufacturing to services, as most factories moved away to either the State of Mexico, or more commonly to the northern border. By contrast, corporate office buildings set their base in the city.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* List of pre-columbian archaeological sites in Mexico City\n* List of colonial churches in Mexico City\n* List of colonial non-religious buildings in Mexico City\n* Cuisine of Mexico City\n* Six Flags México\n* Gentrification of Mexico City\n* Greater Mexico City\n* Historic center of Mexico City\n* Barrios Mágicos of Mexico City\n* Mesoamerican Codices\n* Large Cities Climate Leadership Group\n* Largest cities in the Americas\n* Metropolitan areas of Mexico\n* Outline of Mexico\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** In Peninsular Spanish, the spelling variant *Méjico*, is also used alongside *México*.

The Legislative Assembly expanded provisions on abortions, becoming the first federal entity to expand abortion in Mexico beyond cases of rape and economic reasons, to permit it at the choice of the mother before the 12th week of pregnancy.[146] In December 2009, the then Federal District became the first city in Latin America and one of very few in the world to legalize same-sex marriage.[147]\n\n\n\n### Boroughs and neighborhoods[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Boroughs of Mexico City and Neighborhoods in Mexico City\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEconomically, Mexico City prospered as a result of trade.

The only borough that did not have a high HDI was that of rural Milpa Alta, which had a \"medium\" HDI of 0.7984, far below those of all the other boroughs (627th nationally, the rest being in the top 200). Mexico City's HDI for the 2005 report was 0.9012 (very high), and its 2010 value of 0.9225 (very high), or (by newer methodology) 0.8307, was Mexico's highest.[150]\n\n\n\n### Law enforcement[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Law enforcement in Mexico City\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe country hosted the FIFA World Cup in 1970 and 1986, and Azteca Stadium is the first stadium in World Cup history to host the final twice.

The city hosted the 1955 and 1975 Pan American Games, the latter after Santiago and São Paulo withdrew. The ICF Flatwater Racing World Championships were hosted here in 1974 and 1994.

As the depth of the lake water fluctuated, Mexico City was subject to periodic flooding. A major labor draft, the *desagüe*, compelled thousands of indigenous over the colonial period to work on infrastructure to prevent flooding. Floods were not only an inconvenience but also a health hazard, since during flood periods human waste polluted the city's streets. By draining the area, the mosquito population dropped as did the frequency of the diseases they spread. However, draining the wetlands also changed the habitat for fish and birds and the areas accessible for indigenous cultivation close to the capital.[58] The 16th century saw a proliferation of churches, many of which can still be seen today in the historic center.[53]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n140. **^** Tavera Fenollosa, Ligia (3 March 2016). \"Eventful temporality and the unintended outcomes of Mexico's earthquake victims movement\".

(The Mexican–American War had just been fought.) The last changes to the limits of Mexico City were made between 1898 and 1902, reducing the area to the current 1,479 km2 (571 sq mi) by adjusting the southern border with the state of Morelos. By that time, the total number of municipalities within Mexico City was twenty-two. In 1941, the General Anaya borough was merged with the Central Department, which was then renamed \"Mexico City\" (thus reviving the name but not the autonomous municipality). From 1941 to 1970, the Federal District comprised twelve *delegaciones* and Mexico City. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe World Bank has sponsored a project to curb air pollution through public transport improvements and the Mexican government has started shutting down polluting factories. They have phased out diesel buses and mandated new emission controls on new cars; since 1993 all new cars must be fitted with a catalytic converter, which reduces the emissions released. Trucks must use only liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Also construction of an underground rail system was begun in 1968 in order to help curb air pollution problems and alleviate traffic congestion. It has over 201 km (125 mi) of track and carries over 5 million people every day. Fees are kept low to encourage use of the system and during rush hours the crush is so great, that authorities have reserved a special carriage specifically for women. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIt is also a leading center of the advertising industry. Most international ad firms have offices in the city, including Grey, JWT, Leo Burnett, Euro RSCG, BBDO, Ogilvy, Saatchi & Saatchi, and McCann Erickson. Many local firms also compete in the sector, including Alazraki, Olabuenaga/Chemistri, Terán, Augusto Elías, and Clemente Cámara, among others. There are 60 radio stations operating in the city and many local community radio transmission networks.\n\n\nThe two largest media companies in the Spanish-speaking world, Televisa and TV Azteca, are headquartered in Mexico City. Televisa, it often presents itself as the largest producer of Spanish-language content.[198] Other local television channels include:\n\n\nXHDF 1 (Azteca Uno),[199]\nXEW 2 (Televisa W),[200]\nXHCTMX 3,\nXHTV 4,\nXHGC 5,\nXHTDMX 6,\nXHIMT 7,\nXEQ 9,\nXEIPN 11,\nXHUNAM 20,\nXHCDM 21,\nXEIMT 22,\nXHTRES 28,\nXHTVM 40 and\nXHHCU 45.\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Mexico City Metro\nMain article: Mexico City Metro\n\nMexico City is served by the Mexico City Metro, a 225.9 km (140 mi) metro system, which is the largest in Latin America. The first portions were opened in 1969 and it has expanded to 12 lines with 195 stations, transporting 4.4 million people every day.[176]\n\n\n\n### Tren Suburbano[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tren Suburbano\n\nA suburban rail system, the Tren Suburbano serves the metropolitan area, beyond the reach of the metro, with one line serving to municipalities such as Tlalnepantla and Cuautitlán Izcalli, but with future lines planned to serve e.g. Chalco and La Paz.\n\n\nElectric transport other than the metro also exists, in the form of several Mexico City trolleybus routes and the Xochimilco Light Rail line, both of which are operated by Servicio de Transportes Eléctricos.

In 1900, the population of Mexico City was about 500,000.[69] The city began to grow rapidly westward in the early part of the 20th century.[53] In the 1920s the Caracas exile community was forcefully relocated from Havana to Mexico City. As a consequence, Mexico City became the epicenter of anti-imperialism.[70]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Mexico City in 1690. Atlas Van der Hagen.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMexico City offers a variety of cuisines: restaurants specializing in the regional cuisines of Mexico's 31 states are available in the city, and the city also has several branches of internationally recognized restaurants. These include Paris' Au Pied de Cochon and Brasserie Lipp, Philippe (by Philippe Chow); Nobu, Quintonil, Morimoto; Pámpano, owned by Mexican-raised opera singer Plácido Domingo. There are branches of Japanese restaurant Suntory, Italian restaurant Alfredo, as well as New York steakhouses Morton's and The Palm, and Monte Carlo's BeefBar. Three of Lima's Haute restaurants, serving Peruvian cuisine, have locations in Mexico City: La Mar, Segundo Muelle and Astrid y Gastón.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe city is colloquially known as *Chilangolandia* after the locals' nickname *chilangos*.[34] Chilango is used pejoratively by people living outside Mexico City to \"connote a loud, arrogant, ill-mannered, loutish person\".[35] For their part those living in Mexico City designate insultingly those who live elsewhere as living in *la provincia* (\"the provinces\", the periphery) and many proudly embrace the term chilango.[36] Residents of Mexico City are more recently called *defeños* (deriving from the postal abbreviation of the Federal District in Spanish: D.F., which is read \"De-Efe\"). They are formally called *capitalinos* (in reference to the city being the capital of the country), but \"[p]erhaps because capitalino is the more polite, specific, and correct word, it is almost never utilized\".[37]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Mexico City\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Mexico City.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Satellite image of Mexico City\nMexico City is located in the Valley of Mexico, sometimes called the Basin of Mexico. This valley is located in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt in the high plateaus of south-central Mexico.[77][78]\n\n\nIt has a minimum altitude of 2,200 meters (7,200 feet) above sea level and is surrounded by mountains and volcanoes that reach elevations of over 5,000 meters (16,000 feet).[79] This valley has no natural drainage outlet for the waters that flow from the mountainsides, making the city vulnerable to flooding. Drainage was engineered through the use of canals and tunnels starting in the 17th century.[77][79]\n\n\nMexico City primarily rests on what was Lake Texcoco.[77] Seismic activity is frequent there.[80] Lake Texcoco was drained starting from the 17th century. Although none of the lake waters remain, the city rests on the lake bed's heavily saturated clay. This soft base is collapsing due to the over-extraction of groundwater, called *groundwater-related subsidence*.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Ciudad de México* (Spanish)\n |\n| --- |\n| Capital and megacity\n |\n| ![](image)\nSkyline of Mexico City with the Torre Latinoamericana\n![](image)\nAngel of Independence\n![](image)\nMuseo Soumaya\n![](image)\nMonument to the Revolution\n![](image)\nPaseo de la Reforma from the Chapultepec Castle\n![](image)\nCathedral and the Zócalo\n![](image)\nPalace of Fine Arts\n![](image)\nSanta Fe business district\n |\n| \n![Coat of arms of Mexico City](image)Coat of arms\n![Official logo of Mexico City](image)Government logo\n |\n| Nickname: CDMX\n |\n| Motto(s): *La Ciudad de los Palacios**(The City of Palaces)*\n |\n| ![Mexico City within Mexico](image)Mexico City within Mexico\n |\n| ![Mexico City is located in Mexico](image)![Mexico City](image)\nMexico City\nLocation within Mexico\nShow map of Mexico\n![Mexico City is located in North America](image)![Mexico City](image)\nMexico City\nMexico City (North America)\nShow map of North America\n |\n| Coordinates: 19°26′N 99°8′W﻿ / ﻿19.433°N 99.133°W﻿ / 19.433; -99.133 |\n| Country | ![](image) Mexico |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn addition, according to the Secretariat of Tourism, the city has about 170 museums—is among the top ten of cities in the world with highest number of museums[173]—over 100 art galleries, and some 30 concert halls, all of which maintain a constant cultural activity during the whole year. Many areas (e.g. Palacio Nacional and the National Institute of Cardiology) have murals painted by Diego Rivera. He and his wife Frida Kahlo lived in Coyoacán, where several of their homes, studios, and art collections are open to the public. The house where Leon Trotsky was initially granted asylum and finally murdered in 1940 is also in Coyoacán. In addition, there are several *haciendas* that are now restaurants, such as the San Ángel Inn, the Hacienda de Tlalpan, Hacienda de Cortés and the Hacienda de los Morales.\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transportation in Mexico City\n\n### Airports[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTo clean up pollution, the federal and local governments implemented numerous plans including the constant monitoring and reporting of environmental conditions, such as ozone and nitrogen oxides.[85] When the levels of these two pollutants reached critical levels, contingency actions were implemented which included closing factories, changing school hours, and extending the *A day without a car* program to two days of the week.[85] The government also instituted industrial technology improvements, a strict biannual vehicle emission inspection and the reformulation of gasoline and diesel fuels.[85] The introduction of Metrobús bus rapid transit and the Ecobici bike-sharing were among efforts to encourage alternate, greener forms of transportation.[84]\n\n\n\n### Parks and recreation[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the colonial period, the city's motto was \"Muy Noble e Insigne, Muy Leal e Imperial\" (Very Noble and Distinguished, Very Loyal and Imperial).[32][33] During Andrés Manuel López Obrador's administration a political slogan was introduced: *la Ciudad de la Esperanza* (\"The City of Hope\"). This motto was quickly adopted as a city nickname but has faded since the new motto, *Capital en Movimiento* (\"Capital in Movement\"), was adopted by the administration headed by Marcelo Ebrard, though the latter is not treated as often as a nickname in media. \nUp until 2013, it was common to refer to the city by the initialism \n\"DF\" from \"Distrito Federal de México\". Since 2013, the abbreviation \"CDMX\" (Ciudad de México) has been more common, particularly in relation to government campaigns.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOther sports facilities in Mexico City are the Palacio de los Deportes indoor arena, Francisco Márquez Olympic Swimming Pool, the Hipódromo de Las Américas, the Agustin Melgar Olympic Velodrome, and venues for equestrianism and horse racing, ice hockey, rugby, American-style football, baseball, and basketball. Bullfighting takes place every Sunday during bullfighting season at the 50,000-seat Plaza México, the world's largest bullring. Mexico City's golf courses have hosted Women's LPGA action, and two Men's Golf World Cups. Courses throughout the city are available as private as well as public venues.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nAzteca Stadium\n![](image)\nUniversity Olympic Stadium\n![](image)\nSports City Stadium\n![](image)\nAlfredo Harp Helú Stadium\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Mexico portal\n* ![](image)Mesoamerica portal\n* ![map](image)Latin America portal\n* ![map](image)North America portal\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The Turibus runs through many of the most important tourist attractions in the city.\nMexico City is a destination for many foreign tourists.

Landmarks in the Historic Center include the Plaza de la Constitución (Zócalo), the main central square with its epoch-contrasting Spanish-era Metropolitan Cathedral and National Palace, ancient Aztec temple ruins Templo Mayor (\"Major Temple\") and modern structures, all within a few steps of one another. (The Templo Mayor was discovered in 1978 while workers were digging to place underground electric cables).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n177. **^** \"¿Cuántos autos circulan en la CDMX diariamente?\". *El Economista* (in Spanish).

Since then, the whole Federal District, whose *delegaciones* had by then almost formed a single urban area, began to be considered *de facto* a synonym of Mexico City.[139]\n\n\nThe lack of a *de jure* stipulation left a legal vacuum that led to a number of sterile discussions about whether one concept had engulfed the other or if the latter had ceased to exist altogether. In 1993, the situation was solved by an amendment to the 44th article of the Constitution of Mexico; Mexico City and the Federal District were stated to be the same entity. The amendment was later introduced into the second article of the Statute of Government of the Federal District.[139]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAmong its many public and private schools (K–13), the city offers multi-cultural, multi-lingual and international schools attended by Mexican and foreign students.

There are a multitude of venues hosting Spanish and foreign-language performers. These include the 10,000-seat National Auditorium that regularly schedules the Spanish and English-language pop and rock artists, as well as many of the world's leading performing arts ensembles, the auditorium also broadcasts grand opera performances from New York's Metropolitan Opera on giant, high definition screens. In 2007 National Auditorium was selected world's best venue by multiple genre media. Other sites for pop-artist performances include the 3,000-seat Teatro Metropolitan, the 15,000-seat Palacio de los Deportes, and the larger 50,000-seat Foro Sol Stadium, where popular international artists perform on a regular basis. The Cirque du Soleil has held several seasons at the Carpa Santa Fe, in the Santa Fe district in the western part of the city. There are numerous venues for smaller musical ensembles and solo performers. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe city has also hosted several NBA pre-season games and has hosted international basketball's FIBA Americas Championship, along with north-of-the-border Major League Baseball exhibition games at Foro Sol. In 2017, NBA commissioner Adam Silver expressed interest in placing an NBA G League expansion team in Mexico City as early as 2018.

It will have its own constitution and its legislature, and its *delegaciones* will now be headed by mayors.[28] Because of a clause in the Mexican Constitution, however, as it is the seat of the powers of the federation, it can never become a state, or the capital of the country has to be relocated elsewhere.[30]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_yHalADdQtJaLi44nyXTv32MM","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
