In this ranking 3 points are awarded for a win, 1 for a draw and 0 for a loss. As per statistical convention in football, matches decided in extra time are counted as wins and losses, while matches decided by penalty shoot-outs are counted as draws. Teams are ranked by total points, then by goal difference, then by goals scored.\n\n\n\n*As of 2022 FIFA World Cup*[31][32]\n\n\n| Rank\n | Team\n | Part | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts |\n|

body, the *Deutscher Fußball-Bund* (DFB), since 1904. Following World War II and the division of Germany, the DFB was re-admitted to FIFA after the 1950 World Cup as West Germany. Saar competed in the 1954 World Cup qualifying before joining West Germany in 1956. East Germany fielded teams of their own from 1958 to 1990 before joining with West Germany and the DFB during the German reunification. FIFA officially attributes all international results of the DFB team since 1908 to Germany, including the results of West Germany from 1954–1990.\n2. **^** The Soviet Union qualified seven times prior to its dissolution in 1991. The 15 nations that were former Soviet republics now compete separately. FIFA considers Russia as the successor team of the Soviet Union.\n3. **^** The Yugoslavia national football team qualified eight times during eras of Kingdom of Yugoslavia (1930) and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (1950–1990). They qualified from 1930–1990 under the name Yugoslavia prior to its breakup in 1992 by the secession of many of its constituent republics. They qualified once in 1998 as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, then changed its name to Serbia and Montenegro in 2003, only qualifying under that name in 2006. All of these teams are considered the predecessors of the current Serbia team by FIFA, which first qualified under that name in 2010. The other national teams which resulted from the breakup of the SFR Yugoslavia in 1992 — Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and North Macedonia — are considered distinct entities from the Yugoslavia team of 1930–1990. Montenegro now also competes separately after independence in 2006 and Kosovo was recognized by FIFA in 2016.\n4. **^** Czechoslovakia qualified eight times prior to being divided into Slovakia and the Czech Republic in 1993. FIFA considers the Czech Republic as the successor team of Czechoslovakia. The other national team which resulted from the breakup of the Czechoslovakia, Slovakia, is considered a distinct entity from the Czechoslovakia team. The Czech Republic national team qualified for the World Cup for the first time as a separate nation in 2006, with Slovakia doing the same in 2010.\n5. **^** Indonesia competed as the Dutch East Indies in 1938.\n6. **^** The Democratic Republic of the Congo competed as Zaire in 1974.\n7. **^** Uruguay (76 years) and England (60 years) have longer active streaks.\n8. **^** Only played in first two matches; medal awarded retroactively by FIFA in 2007.[44]\n9. **^** Pelé, Lothar Matthäus, Pierre Littbarski and Ronaldo each appeared three times in the squads of the teams that reached the finals, but none of them played in all three games.[46]\n10. **^** Different sources give Pelé between 8 and 10 assists.[77]\n11. **^** Zuberbühler kept goal throughout every minute of Switzerland's four matches. Other keepers have kept clean sheets only playing part of their team's matches.\n12. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Attended three tournaments but did not act as main referee in all of them. Instead, he was exclusively used as a fourth official in a minimum of one edition.\n13. **^** Putting French players off.[133]\n14. **^** Cufré was red carded for kicking Per Mertesacker in an altercation following the match.[134]\n15. **^** Also known as Battle of Nuremberg.\n16. **^** The players sent off were Pedro Monzón and Gustavo Dezotti.[140]\n17. **^** Šimunić was given three yellow cards in the match as the referee failed to send him off the pitch after the second yellow, and was only red carded after the third yellow.[144]\n18. **^** Biyik missed the team's second game after receiving a red card in the first,[146] and then missed Cameroon's fifth game after yellow cards in the third and fourth.[147][148] Others, including Zinedine Zidane in 2006, have earned a second suspension in their team's final match of the tournament, not servable during the tournament.\n19. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** ***n*** ***o*** ***p*** ***q*** ***r*** ***s*** Successful kicks in a penalty shoot-out are not counted as goals (but penalties scored in the normal course of play are counted).\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"The FIFA World Cup in numbers\". *Al Jazeera English*. 14 November 2022.

The championship has been awarded every four years since 1930, except in 1942 and 1946, when it was not held because of World War II.\n\n\nThe World Cup final match is the last of the competition, played by the only two teams remaining in contention, and the result determines which country is declared the world champion. It is a one-off match decided in regulation time. In case of a draw, extra time is used. If scores are then still level, a penalty shoot-out determines the winner,[1] under the rules in force since 1986; prior to that, finals still tied after extra time would have been replayed,[n 1] though this never proved necessary. The golden goal rule would have applied during extra time in 1998 and 2002, but was not put in practice either.\n\n\nThe only exception to this type of format was the 1950 World Cup, which featured a final round-robin group of four teams; the decisive match of that group is often regarded as the *de facto* final of that tournament, including by FIFA itself.[3]\n\n\nThe team that wins the final receives the FIFA World Cup Trophy, and its name is engraved on the bottom side of the trophy.[4] Of 80 different nations that have appeared in the tournament, 13 have made it to the final, and 8 have won. Brazil, the only team that has participated in every World Cup, is also the most successful team in the competition, having won five titles and finished second twice.[5] Italy and Germany[n 2] have four titles each, with Germany having reached more finals than any other team, eight. Current champion Argentina has three titles, Uruguay and France have two each, while England and Spain have one each. Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Sweden, the Netherlands and Croatia have played in the final without winning. Only teams from Europe (UEFA) and South America (CONMEBOL) have ever competed in the final.\n\n\nArgentina defeated France on penalties in the latest final, staged at Qatar's Lusail Stadium in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n## List of final matches[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![List of FIFA World Cup finals is located in Europe](image)![London (1966)](image)\n**London(1966)**\n![Paris (1938,

For knockout matches other than the finals, penalty shoot-outs had been adopted from 1978, while lots would have been drawn between 1962 and 1974.[2]\n2. **^** The team's totals include the records of West Germany (1954–1990).[6]\n3. **^** Decisive match of a final stage; technically not a final but often regarded as such.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n**General**\n\n\n\n* \"World Cup 1930-2018\".

For instance, of those who reported residing in another country less than 10 years before the 2000 census, 66.9 percent were Brazilians. If only the returning migrants (former Brazilian immigrants) are considered, 26.8 percent of Brazilians came from Paraguay, 17 percent came from Japan, and 15.8 percent came from the United States.[37]\n\n\nAs political unrest, increasing violence, inflation, soaring unemployment rates and an economic crisis hit Brazil, millions of citizens moved abroad starting in 2011, generating the largest emigration process ever witnessed in Brazilian history, since Brazil has historically been a land of immigrants. In 2021 more than 4.4 million Brazilians live abroad,[38] this is an increase of around 132% compared to the previous 10 years.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Immigration to Brazil, by national origin, periods from 1830 to 1933**Source: Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics (IBGE)\n |\n|  | **Period**\n |\n| **origin** | 1830–1855\n | 1856–1883\n | 1884–1893\n | 1894–1903\n | 1904–1913\n | 1914–1923\n | 1924–1933\n | 1934–2018\n |\n| Portuguese\n | 16,737\n | 116,000\n | 170,621\n | 155,542\n | 384,672\n | 201,252\n | 233,650\n | 400,000\n |\n| Italians\n | —\n | 100,000\n | 510,533\n | 537,784\n | 196,521\n | 86,320\n | 70,177\n |\n| Spaniards\n | —\n | —\n | 113,116\n | 102,142\n | 224,672\n | 94,779\n | 52,400\n |\n| Germans\n | 2,008\n | 30,000\n | 22,778\n | 6,698\n | 33,859\n | 29,339\n | 61,723\n |\n| Japanese\n | —\n | —\n | —\n | —\n | 11,868\n | 20,398\n | 110,191\n |\n| Lebanese\n | —\n | —\n | 96\n | 7,124\n | 45,803\n | 20,400\n | 20,400\n |\n| Others\n | —\n | —\n | 66,524\n | 42,820\n | 109,222\n | 51,493\n | 164,586\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** População do Brasil – IBGE\n2. **^** \"Censo Demográfi co 20200 Características da população e dos domicílios Resultados do universo\" (PDF). 8 November 2021.

In the same year around 680,000 Brazilians - hence 15.5% of the Brazilian diaspora - lived in Spanish-speaking countries, with the majority found in neighbouring countries such as Paraguay and Uruguay.\n\n\nOther major communities are found in countries such as the UK (220,000 Brazilians in 2021), Canada (122,500 Brazilians in 2021) Ireland (70,000 Brazilians in 2021) and Australia (60,000 Brazilians in 2021).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThere are also noticeable Brazilian communities in countries once source of immigrants such as Japan (210,000 Brazilians in 2021), Italy (162,000 Brazilians in 2021), Germany (140,000 Brazilians in 2021), the Netherlands (65,000 Brazilians in 2021) and Lebanon (21,000 Brazilians in 2021). Many of the Brazilians found in these countries are descendants of the early immigrants who came to Brazil in the early 1900s.\n\n\nThere is also a sizeable Brazilian community in France (172,000 Brazilians in 2021), almost equally split between Metropolitan France and French Guyana.\n\n\n\n## Racial composition[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Race and ethnicity in Brazil\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n17. **^** \"United Nations Statistics Division – Demographic and Social Statistics\". *unstats.un.org*.\n18. **^** \"Estatísticas Vitais – Mortalidade e Nascidos Vivos\". *TABNET – Ministerio da Saúde*.

Despite the surge in the phenomenon, there were no specific policies implemented by the government to encourage or discourage this emigration process.[37] Thanks to the favourable outlook of the Brazilian economy and due to the crisis that hit countries such as Japan, Portugal or the United States, emigration of Brazilian citizens stagnated - with many returning to their home country - until 2011, when 1,898,762 Brazilians were living abroad.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| **Region**[89] | **European** | **African** | **Native American** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| North Region | 51%\n | 17%\n | 32%\n |\n| Northeast Region | 61%\n | 26%\n | 13%\n |\n| Central-West Region | 58%\n | 26%\n | 16%\n |\n| Southeast Region | 61%\n | 27%\n | 12%\n |\n| South Region | 74%\n | 15%\n | 11%\n |\n\n\nAn autosomal DNA study from 2009 found a similar profile: \"all the Brazilian samples (regions) lie more closely to the European group than to the African populations or to the Mestizos from Mexico\".[90]\n\n\n\n\n\n| **Region**[91] | **European** | **African** | **Native American** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| North Region | 60.6%\n | 21.3%\n | 18.1%\n |\n| Northeast Region | 68.3%\n | 21.1%\n | 10.6%\n |\n| Central-West Region | 66.3%\n | 21.7%\n | 12.0%\n |\n| Southeast Region | 60.7%\n | 32.0%\n | 7.3%\n |\n| South Region | 81.5%\n | 9.3%\n | 9.2%\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n59. **^** \"Research Professor, A.C.

Many came from Guinea-Bissau, or from West African countries – by the end of the eighteenth century many had been taken from the Kingdom of Kongo and modern-day Angola, Congo, Mozambique, Benin and Nigeria. By the time of the end of the slave trade in 1850, around six million slaves had been brought to Brazil–50% of all slave traffic between Africa and the Americas. Nowadays, there are still small immigration waves coming from the African continent.\nThe largest influx of European immigrants to Brazil occurred in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. According to the *Memorial do Imigrante* statistics data, Brazil attracted nearly 5 million immigrants between 1870 and 1953.[31][32]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn the other hand, in 1998, the IBGE, within its preparation for the 2000 census, experimentally introduced a question about \"origem\" (origin/ancestry) in its \"Pesquisa Mensal de Emprego\" (Monthly Employment Research), to test the viability of introducing that variable in the census[33]: 3 (the IBGE ended by deciding against the inclusion of questions about it in the census).

An additional figure of 1.2 million Portuguese arrived between 1951 and 1975 to settle mostly in the Southeast.[71] Nowadays, Lusitanians (Portuguese) constitute the biggest group of foreigners living in the country, with over 700,000 Portuguese nationals currently living in Brazil.[72] The vast majority arrived in the last decade. The first semester of 2011 solely had an increase of 52 thousand Portuguese nationals applying for a permanent residence visa while another large group was granted Brazilian citizenship.[73][74]\n* Spaniards came in large numbers to Brazil, starting in the late 19th century. Most of them were attracted to work in the coffee plantations in the state of São Paulo. An estimated 15 million Brazilians are of direct Spanish descent.[75]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAccording to the 2020 census, there were more than 104 million European-Brazilians, comprising 48% of Brazil's population.[50] European-Brazilians are defined as people who are solely or mostly descended from European immigrants, although most Brazilians have some degree of European ancestry. Europeans are found in the entire territory of Brazil, although they are most concentrated in the south and southeastern parts of the country. \n[51][52]\n\n\nA survey conducted in 1998 by the Minas Gerais sociologist Simon Schwartzman interviewed about 34 million Brazilians, of whom nearly 20 million declared themselves white.

The Portuguese came to explore the precious stones that were found there. Contact between the Portuguese and the Indians created a mixed-race population. Until the mid-20th century, Central-West Brazil had a very small population. The situation changed with the construction of Brasília, the new capital of Brazil, in 1960. Many workers were attracted to the region, mostly from northeastern Brazil.\n\n\nA new wave of settlers started arriving from the 1970s. With the mechanization of agriculture in the South of Brazil, many rural workers of German and Italian origin migrated to Central-West Brazil. In some areas, they are already the majority of the population.\n\n\n\n## Education and health[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Education in Brazil and Health care in Brazil\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSão Paulo state, the most populous state in Brazil, with about 40 million people, showed the following composition, according to an autosomal study from 2006: European genes account for 79% of the heritage of the people of São Paulo, 14% are of African origin, and 7% Native American.[94] A study from 2013 found the following composition in São Paulo state: 61.9% European, 25.5% African and 11.6% Native American.[95] Another study focused on highly admixed populations yielded similar results.[96]\n\n\n\n## Races and ethnicities by region[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Brazil socio-geographic division\n\n### South[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Centro-Sul\n\nThe South of Brazil is the region with the largest percentage of Europeans.

Immigrants found a strong social and cultural tolerance toward inter-racial marriage, including large numbers of Mulattoes (European and African), Caboclos (Indian and European) and mixed European, African and Indian people, though it was not accompanied by an entire lack of racism. Correspondingly, the same mentality reflected in low psychological and social barriers regarding intermarriage between Europeans, Middle Easterners and Asians of several origins, as well as between people of different religions.\n\n\n\n### History of immigration[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n88. **^** Saloum de Neves Manta, Fernanda; Pereira, Rui; Vianna, Romulo; Rodolfo Beuttenmüller de Araújo, Alfredo; Leite Góes Gitaí, Daniel; Aparecida da Silva, Dayse; de Vargas Wolfgramm, Eldamária; da Mota Pontes, Isabel; Ivan Aguiar, José; Ozório Moraes, Milton; Fagundes de Carvalho, Elizeu; Gusmão, Leonor; O'Rourke, Dennis (20 September 2013). \"Revisiting the Genetic Ancestry of Brazilians Using Autosomal AIM-Indels\". *PLOS ONE*. **8** (9): e75145.

An immigration boom occurred in the 19th and 20th centuries, when nearly six million Europeans emigrated to Brazil, most of them Portuguese, Germans, Italians and Spaniards.\n\n\nMany European-Brazilians have some Amerindian and/or African ancestry (similarly found in European-Americans[55] and European-Argentines).[56] It is estimated that 75% of all Brazilians have varying degrees of Portuguese ancestry.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHigher education has three main purposes: teaching, research and extension, each with their own specific contribution to make to a particular course.

'Following an increasing North to South gradient, European ancestry was the most prevalent in all urban populations (with values up to 74%). The populations in the North consisted of a significant proportion of Native American ancestry that was about two times higher than the African contribution. Conversely, in the Northeast, Center-West and Southeast, African ancestry was the second most prevalent. At an intrapopulation level, all urban\npopulations were highly admixed, and most of the variation in ancestry proportions was observed between individuals within each population rather than among population'.[88]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1.68 children born/woman (IBGE 2021 est.)[23][24]\n\n\n\n### Structure of the population[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe vast majority of the immigrants came from Italy. Brazil attracted nearly 5 million immigrants between 1870 and 1953. The large number of Italians are visible in many parts of Southeast Brazil. Their descendants are nowadays predominant in many areas. For example, Northeast São Paulo is 45% Italian.[109]\n\n\nThe arrival of immigrants from several parts of Europe, the Middle-East and Asia produced an ethnically diverse population. The city of Bastos, in São Paulo, is 11.4% Japanese. The city of São Paulo is home to the largest Japanese population outside Japan itself.\n[110]\n\n\n\n### Northeast[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Nordeste (socio-geographic division)\n\nThe population of Northeast Brazil is a result of an intensive race mixing, which has occurred in the region for more than four centuries. According to the 2006 census people reported as \"Pardo\" (Multiracial) make up 60.5% of the population. Those reported as African account for 5.9%.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n65. **^** Pupp Spinassé, Karen (2008). \"Os imigrantes alemães e seus descendentes no Brasil : a língua como fator identitário e inclusivo\" [German immigrants and their descendants in Brazil: language as an identity and inclusive factor]. *Conexão Letras* (in Portuguese). **3** (3): 125–140. hdl:10183/20697.\n66. **^** Altenhofen, Cléo Vilson: Hunsrückisch in Rio Grande do Sul, Franz Steiner Verlag, Stuttgart 1996\n67. **^** Levy, Maria Stella Ferreira (June 1974). \"O papel da migração internacional na evolução da população brasileira (1872 a 1972)\" [The role of international migration on the evolution of the Brazilian population (1872 to 1972)]. *Revista de Saúde Pública* (in Portuguese). **8** (suppl): 49–90. doi:10.1590/S0034-89101974000500003.\n68. **^** \"São Paulo capital, uma cidade italiana e os misteres profissionais dos imigrantes italianos\". *Brasil500anos.ibge.gov.br*.

For instance, of those who reported residing in another country less than 10 years before the 2000 census, 66.9 percent were Brazilians. If only the returning migrants (former Brazilian immigrants) are considered, 26.8 percent of Brazilians came from Paraguay, 17 percent came from Japan, and 15.8 percent came from the United States.[37]\n\n\nAs political unrest, increasing violence, inflation, soaring unemployment rates and an economic crisis hit Brazil, millions of citizens moved abroad starting in 2011, generating the largest emigration process ever witnessed in Brazilian history, since Brazil has historically been a land of immigrants. In 2021 more than 4.4 million Brazilians live abroad,[38] this is an increase of around 132% compared to the previous 10 years.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Immigration to Brazil, by national origin, periods from 1830 to 1933**Source: Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics (IBGE)\n |\n|  | **Period**\n |\n| **origin** | 1830–1855\n | 1856–1883\n | 1884–1893\n | 1894–1903\n | 1904–1913\n | 1914–1923\n | 1924–1933\n | 1934–2018\n |\n| Portuguese\n | 16,737\n | 116,000\n | 170,621\n | 155,542\n | 384,672\n | 201,252\n | 233,650\n | 400,000\n |\n| Italians\n | —\n | 100,000\n | 510,533\n | 537,784\n | 196,521\n | 86,320\n | 70,177\n |\n| Spaniards\n | —\n | —\n | 113,116\n | 102,142\n | 224,672\n | 94,779\n | 52,400\n |\n| Germans\n | 2,008\n | 30,000\n | 22,778\n | 6,698\n | 33,859\n | 29,339\n | 61,723\n |\n| Japanese\n | —\n | —\n | —\n | —\n | 11,868\n | 20,398\n | 110,191\n |\n| Lebanese\n | —\n | —\n | 96\n | 7,124\n | 45,803\n | 20,400\n | 20,400\n |\n| Others\n | —\n | —\n | 66,524\n | 42,820\n | 109,222\n | 51,493\n | 164,586\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** População do Brasil – IBGE\n2. **^** \"Censo Demográfi co 20200 Características da população e dos domicílios Resultados do universo\" (PDF). 8 November 2021.

Brasília, the capital of Brazil, is its 3rd biggest city.\n\n\n\n## Migration[edit]\n\n\n### Summary[edit]\n\n\nThe United Nations reported in the International Migration Stock that 64 countries had significant emigration or immigration with Brazil in 2020.[26][27] The Migration Policy Institute defines significant migration if 1,000+ people are in the emigration or/and migration group.[28] Venezuela, Haiti, Portugal, Bolivia, and Uruguay have the most positive net migration, while the United States, Japan, Spain, Italy, and France have the most negative net migration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  | Brazil 100%\n | European 47.73%\n | African 7.61%\n | Asian 1.09%\n | Pardo (Multiracial) 43.13%\n | Native Indigenous 0.43%\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Population 0–14 | 45,932,294 | 20,460,482 | 2,698,639 | 420,952 | 22,055,573 | 295,862\n |\n| Percent group 0–14 in race | 24.08% | 22.47% | 18.59% | 20.02% | 26.81% | 36.17%\n |\n| Population 0–14 compared to racial groups | 100% | 44.54% | 5.88% | 0.92% | 48.02% | 0.64%\n |\n| Population 15–49 | 105,816,285 | 49,381,206 | 8,693,350 | 1,178,391 | 46,156,227 | 402,079\n |\n| Proportions 0–14 to 15–49 | 0,43407 | 0,41434 | 0,31043 | 0,35723 | 0,47785 | 0,73583\n |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Demographics of Brazil |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Population pyramid of Brazil in 2020\n |\n| Population | ![Increase](image) 203.062.512 (2022 census) |\n| Growth rate | ![Decrease](image) 0.52% (2022 est.) |\n| Birth rate | ![Decrease](image) 10.96 births/1,000 population (2022 est.) |\n| Death rate | ![Increase](image) 6.81 deaths/1,000 population (2022 est.) |\n| Life expectancy | ![Decrease](image) 77.76 years |\n|  • male | ![Decrease](image) 74.29 years |\n|  • female | ![Decrease](image) 81.23 years |\n| Fertility rate | ![Decrease](image) 1.572 children born/woman (2022 est.) |\n| Infant mortality rate | ![Increase](image) 10.31 deaths/1,000 live births |\n| Net migration rate | ![Increase](image) -0.19 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2022 est.) |\n| Age structure |\n| 0–14 years | ![Decrease](image) 19.77% |\n| 15–64 years | ![Increase](image) 69.72% |\n| 65 and over | ![Increase](image) 10.51% (2023 est.) |\n| Sex ratio |\n| Total | 0.97 male(s)/female (2022 est.) |\n| At birth | 1.05 male(s)/female |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAccording to the IBGE census 2010[114] 64.6% are Roman Catholics; 24% are Protestants and other Christians, 8% are agnostics, atheists or have no religion, 2% are followers of Spiritism, and 1% are members of other religions.

Despite the surge in the phenomenon, there were no specific policies implemented by the government to encourage or discourage this emigration process.[37] Thanks to the favourable outlook of the Brazilian economy and due to the crisis that hit countries such as Japan, Portugal or the United States, emigration of Brazilian citizens stagnated - with many returning to their home country - until 2011, when 1,898,762 Brazilians were living abroad.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| **Region**[89] | **European** | **African** | **Native American** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| North Region | 51%\n | 17%\n | 32%\n |\n| Northeast Region | 61%\n | 26%\n | 13%\n |\n| Central-West Region | 58%\n | 26%\n | 16%\n |\n| Southeast Region | 61%\n | 27%\n | 12%\n |\n| South Region | 74%\n | 15%\n | 11%\n |\n\n\nAn autosomal DNA study from 2009 found a similar profile: \"all the Brazilian samples (regions) lie more closely to the European group than to the African populations or to the Mestizos from Mexico\".[90]\n\n\n\n\n\n| **Region**[91] | **European** | **African** | **Native American** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| North Region | 60.6%\n | 21.3%\n | 18.1%\n |\n| Northeast Region | 68.3%\n | 21.1%\n | 10.6%\n |\n| Central-West Region | 66.3%\n | 21.7%\n | 12.0%\n |\n| Southeast Region | 60.7%\n | 32.0%\n | 7.3%\n |\n| South Region | 81.5%\n | 9.3%\n | 9.2%\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n59. **^** \"Research Professor, A.C.

Many came from Guinea-Bissau, or from West African countries – by the end of the eighteenth century many had been taken from the Kingdom of Kongo and modern-day Angola, Congo, Mozambique, Benin and Nigeria. By the time of the end of the slave trade in 1850, around six million slaves had been brought to Brazil–50% of all slave traffic between Africa and the Americas. Nowadays, there are still small immigration waves coming from the African continent.\nThe largest influx of European immigrants to Brazil occurred in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. According to the *Memorial do Imigrante* statistics data, Brazil attracted nearly 5 million immigrants between 1870 and 1953.[31][32]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn the other hand, in 1998, the IBGE, within its preparation for the 2000 census, experimentally introduced a question about \"origem\" (origin/ancestry) in its \"Pesquisa Mensal de Emprego\" (Monthly Employment Research), to test the viability of introducing that variable in the census[33]: 3 (the IBGE ended by deciding against the inclusion of questions about it in the census). This research interviewed about 90,000 people in six metropolitan regions (São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre, Belo Horizonte, Salvador, and Recife).[34] To this day, it remains the only actual published survey about the immigrant origin of Brazilians.\n\n\nHere are its results:[35]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 17 135 646\n | 8.03\n |\n| 35–39\n | 8 407 755\n | 8 715 968\n | 17 123 723\n | 8.03\n |\n| 40–44\n | 7 737 477\n | 8 186 940\n | 15 924 417\n | 7.47\n |\n| 45–49\n | 6 711 034\n | 7 219 386\n | 13 930 420\n | 6.53\n |\n| 50–54\n | 6 105 571\n | 6 646 021\n | 12 751 592\n | 5.98\n |\n| 55–59\n | 5 418 069\n | 6 065 299\n | 11 483 368\n | 5.38\n |\n| 60–64\n | 4 485 379\n | 5 186 796\n | 9 672 175\n | 4.53\n |\n| 65-69\n | 3 460 918\n | 4 162 815\n | 7 623 733\n | 3.57\n |\n| 70-74\n | 2 499 910\n | 3 142 991\n | 5 642 901\n | 2.65\n |\n| 75-79\n | 1 610 235\n | 2 163 783\n | 3 774 018\n | 1.77\n |\n| 80-84\n | 983 758\n | 1 459 433\n | 2 443 191\n | 1.15\n |\n| 85-89\n | 493 422\n | 824 584\n | 1 318 006\n | 0.62\n |\n| 90+\n | 277 513\n | 578 698\n | 856 211\n | 0.40\n |\n| Age group\n | Male\n | Female\n | Total\n | Percent\n |\n| 0–14\n | 22 519 741\n | 21 520 098\n | 44 039 839\n | 20.65\n |\n| 15–64\n | 72 426 346\n | 75 193 394\n | 147 619 740\n | 69.20\n |\n| 65+\n | 9 325 756\n | 12 332 304\n | 21 658 060\n | 10.15\n |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPairwise estimates of F(st) among the five Brazilian geopolitical regions suggested little genetic differentiation only between the South and the remaining regions. Estimates of ancestry results are consistent with the heterogeneous genetic profile of Brazilian population, with a major contribution of European ancestry (0.771) followed by African (0.143) and Amerindian contributions (0.085). The described multiplexed SNP panels can be useful tool for bioanthropological studies but it can be mainly valuable to control for spurious results in genetic association studies in admixed populations\".[92]\n\n\nAccording to another autosomal DNA study from 2008, by the University of Brasília (UnB), European ancestry dominates in the whole of Brazil (in all regions), accounting for 65.90% of heritage of the population, followed by the African contribution (24.80%) and the Native American (9.3%).[93]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPopulation by Sex and Age Group (Census 30.VII.2010): [25]\n| Age Group\n | Male\n | Female\n | Total\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Total\n | 93 406 990\n | 97 348 809\n | 190 755 799\n | 100\n |\n| 0–4\n | 7 016 987\n | 6 779 171\n | 13 796 158\n | 7.23\n |\n| 5–9\n | 7 624 144\n | 7 345 231\n | 14 969 375\n | 7.85\n |\n| 10–14\n | 8 725 413\n | 8 441 348\n | 17 166 761\n | 9.00\n |\n| 15–19\n | 8 558 868\n | 8 432 004\n | 16 990 872\n | 8.91\n |\n| 20–24\n | 8 630 229\n | 8 614 963\n | 17 245 192\n | 9.04\n |\n| 25–29\n | 8 460 995\n | 8 643 419\n | 17 104 414\n | 8.97\n |\n| 30–34\n | 7 717 658\n | 8 026 854\n | 15 744 512\n | 8.25\n |\n| 35–39\n | 6 766 664\n | 7 121 915\n | 13 888 579\n | 7.28\n |\n| 40–44\n | 6 320 568\n | 6 688 796\n | 13 009 364\n | 6.82\n |\n| 45–49\n | 5 692 014\n | 6 141 338\n | 11 833 352\n | 6.20\n |\n| 50–54\n | 4 834 995\n | 5 305 407\n | 10 140 402\n | 5.32\n |\n| 55–59\n | 3 902 344\n | 4 373 877\n | 8 276 221\n | 4.34\n |\n| 60–64\n | 3 041 035\n | 3 468 085\n | 6 509 120\n | 3.41\n |\n| 65-69\n | 2 224 065\n | 2 616 745\n | 4 840 810\n | 2.54\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn some states in the North and Northeast, the fertility rate was higher than the national average in 2021.

An additional figure of 1.2 million Portuguese arrived between 1951 and 1975 to settle mostly in the Southeast.[71] Nowadays, Lusitanians (Portuguese) constitute the biggest group of foreigners living in the country, with over 700,000 Portuguese nationals currently living in Brazil.[72] The vast majority arrived in the last decade. The first semester of 2011 solely had an increase of 52 thousand Portuguese nationals applying for a permanent residence visa while another large group was granted Brazilian citizenship.[73][74]\n* Spaniards came in large numbers to Brazil, starting in the late 19th century. Most of them were attracted to work in the coffee plantations in the state of São Paulo.

The Portuguese came to explore the precious stones that were found there. Contact between the Portuguese and the Indians created a mixed-race population. Until the mid-20th century, Central-West Brazil had a very small population. The situation changed with the construction of Brasília, the new capital of Brazil, in 1960. Many workers were attracted to the region, mostly from northeastern Brazil.\n\n\nA new wave of settlers started arriving from the 1970s. With the mechanization of agriculture in the South of Brazil, many rural workers of German and Italian origin migrated to Central-West Brazil.

The city of São Paulo is home to the largest Japanese population outside Japan itself.\n[110]\n\n\n\n### Northeast[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Nordeste (socio-geographic division)\n\nThe population of Northeast Brazil is a result of an intensive race mixing, which has occurred in the region for more than four centuries. According to the 2006 census people reported as \"Pardo\" (Multiracial) make up 60.5% of the population. Those reported as African account for 5.9%.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n65. **^** Pupp Spinassé, Karen (2008). \"Os imigrantes alemães e seus descendentes no Brasil : a língua como fator identitário e inclusivo\" [German immigrants and their descendants in Brazil: language as an identity and inclusive factor]. *Conexão Letras* (in Portuguese). **3** (3): 125–140. hdl:10183/20697.\n66. **^** Altenhofen, Cléo Vilson: Hunsrückisch in Rio Grande do Sul, Franz Steiner Verlag, Stuttgart 1996\n67. **^** Levy, Maria Stella Ferreira (June 1974). \"O papel da migração internacional na evolução da população brasileira (1872 a 1972)\" [The role of international migration on the evolution of the Brazilian population (1872 to 1972)]. *Revista de Saúde Pública* (in Portuguese). **8** (suppl): 49–90. doi:10.1590/S0034-89101974000500003.\n68. **^** \"São Paulo capital, uma cidade italiana e os misteres profissionais dos imigrantes italianos\". *Brasil500anos.ibge.gov.br*.

The most important are the Brazilian German dialects, such as Riograndenser Hunsrückisch and the East Pomeranian dialect, and also the Talian, based on the Italian Venetian language. There are also bilingual speakers of Polish, Ukrainian and Russian in Southern Brazil, especially Paraná. In the city of São Paulo, Levantine, Japanese, Chinese and Korean can be heard in the immigrant neighborhoods, such as Liberdade. Yiddish and Hebrew are used by Jewish communities mainly in São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre, Curitiba, Brasília, Belo Horizonte and Recife as well as the Vlax Romani dialect by Romani communities all across the nation.\n\n\n\n## *The World Factbook* demographic statistics[edit]\n\n\nThe following demographic statistics are from *The World Factbook*, unless otherwise indicated[122]\n\n\n\n### Nationality[edit]\n\n\n* noun: Brazilian(s)\n* adjective: Brazilian\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_1VY8qP9mzDjE8gjs8VNnvHV7","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

According to the most recent data, Germany's population is 84,432,670 (31 March 2023)[1] making it the most populous country in the European Union and the nineteenth-most populous country in the world. The total fertility rate was rated at 1.58 in 2021,[6] significantly below the replacement rate of 2.1. For a long time Germany had one of the world's lowest fertility rates of around 1.3 to 1.4, however there has been a small increase in recent years.[7] Due to the low birth rate Germany has recorded more deaths than births every year since 1972,[8] which means 2021 was the 50th consecutive year the German population would have decreased without immigration. However, due to immigration the population has actually increased during the last half-century. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n30. **^** Note: Crude migration change (per 1000) is a trend analysis, an extrapolation based average population change (current year minus previous) minus natural change of the current year (see table statistics).

Since the 1960s, West and later reunified Germany has attracted immigrants primarily from Southern and Eastern Europe as well as Turkey, many of whom (or their children) have acquired German citizenship over time. While most of these immigrants initially arrived as guest workers, changes to guest worker legislation allowed many to stay and to build lives in Germany.\n\n\nGermany had signed special visa agreements with several countries in times of severe labour shortages or when particular skills were deficient within the country. During the 1960s and 1970s, agreements were signed with the governments of Turkey, Yugoslavia, Italy and Spain to help Germany overcome its severe labour shortage.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nLanguages spoken at home, 2022 micro census\n| Language\n | Absolute number\n | Percentage\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Total population\n | 83,103,000\n |

The politics of the German Democratic Republic was pronatalistic[15] while that of the Federal Republic was compensatory.\n\n\nFertility in the GDR was higher than that in the FRG. Demographic politics was only one of the reasons. Women in the GDR had fewer \"biographic options\", young motherhood was expected of them. State funded costfree childcare was available to all mothers.[16]\n\n\n\nMother's mean age at first birth in East and West Germany\n\nNote: Berlin is included into East Germany for the year 2002 and 2008.

Since reunification, German authorities rely on a *micro census*.\nDemographic statistics according to the World Population Review.[28] Due to the privacy concerns of the German population after reunification, Germany did not hold a regular census until the EU-mandated 2011 German Census. The requirement was met with large disapproval. As required by the EU, Germany now continues to hold censuses every 10 years.[29]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_C1PWxEolBHEjXpP8vk1Lhgo2","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

According to the most recent data, Germany's population is 84,432,670 (31 March 2023)[1] making it the most populous country in the European Union and the nineteenth-most populous country in the world. The total fertility rate was rated at 1.58 in 2021,[6] significantly below the replacement rate of 2.1. For a long time Germany had one of the world's lowest fertility rates of around 1.3 to 1.4, however there has been a small increase in recent years.[7] Due to the low birth rate Germany has recorded more deaths than births every year since 1972,[8] which means 2021 was the 50th consecutive year the German population would have decreased without immigration. However, due to immigration the population has actually increased during the last half-century. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n30. **^** Note: Crude migration change (per 1000) is a trend analysis, an extrapolation based average population change (current year minus previous) minus natural change of the current year (see table statistics).

Since the 1960s, West and later reunified Germany has attracted immigrants primarily from Southern and Eastern Europe as well as Turkey, many of whom (or their children) have acquired German citizenship over time. While most of these immigrants initially arrived as guest workers, changes to guest worker legislation allowed many to stay and to build lives in Germany.\n\n\nGermany had signed special visa agreements with several countries in times of severe labour shortages or when particular skills were deficient within the country. During the 1960s and 1970s, agreements were signed with the governments of Turkey, Yugoslavia, Italy and Spain to help Germany overcome its severe labour shortage.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nLanguages spoken at home, 2022 micro census\n| Language\n | Absolute number\n | Percentage\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Total population\n | 83,103,000\n |

The politics of the German Democratic Republic was pronatalistic[15] while that of the Federal Republic was compensatory.\n\n\nFertility in the GDR was higher than that in the FRG. Demographic politics was only one of the reasons. Women in the GDR had fewer \"biographic options\", young motherhood was expected of them.

Since reunification, German authorities rely on a *micro census*.\nDemographic statistics according to the World Population Review.[28] Due to the privacy concerns of the German population after reunification, Germany did not hold a regular census until the EU-mandated 2011 German Census. The requirement was met with large disapproval. As required by the EU, Germany now continues to hold censuses every 10 years.[29]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_C1PWxEolBHEjXpP8vk1Lhgo2","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

In addition, after centuries of net emigration, from the 1980s Italy has experienced large-scale immigration for the first time in modern history. Italian government data, in its annual report for 2019, estimated the amount of foreign nationals residing within Italy, including immigrants, to be at approximately 5.234 million people.[3] Due to such large-scale immigration to the country, particularly from the early 2000s to 2014, the population peaked at 60.79 million. Since then, decreasing migration, a continuously falling birth rate, and continuous aging have led to a sharp decrease in the Italian population.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% p.a. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1861  | 21,777,334 | —     |\n| 1871  | 26,801,154 | +2.10% |\n| 1881  | 28,459,628 | +0.60% |\n| 1901  | 32,475,253 | +0.66% |\n| 1911  | 34,671,377 | +0.66% |\n| 1921  | 37,973,977 | +0.91% |\n| 1931  | 41,176,671 | +0.81% |\n| 1936  | 42,993,602 | +0.87% |\n| 1951  | 47,515,537 | +0.67% |\n| 1961  | 50,623,569 | +0.64% |\n| 1971  | 54,136,547 | +0.67% |\n| 1981  | 56,556,911 | +0.44% |\n| 1991  | 56,778,031 | +0.04% |\n| 2001  | 56,995,744 | +0.04% |\n| 2011  | 59,433,744 | +0.42% |\n| 2021 (est.)  | 59,257,566 | −0.03% |\n| Source: ISTAT[39][40][32] |\n\n\nFurther information: Italians\n\nDemographic statistics according to the World Population Review in 2022.[41]\n\n\n\n* One birth every 1 minute 18 seconds\n* One death every 50 seconds\n* Net loss of one person every 3 minutes 6 seconds\n* One net migrant every 9 minutes\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 1.68\n |\n| 1981\n | 56,502,000\n | 628,113\n | 540,764\n | 87,349\n | 11.0\n | 9.7\n | 1.4\n | -0.7\n | 1.60\n |\n| 1982\n | 56,544,000\n | 634,678\n | 537,727\n | 96,951\n | 10.9\n | 9.5\n | 1.5\n | -1.1\n | 1.60\n |\n| 1983\n | 56,564,000\n | 612,936\n | 563,807\n | 49,129\n | 10.6\n | 10.0\n | 0.7\n | -0.5\n | 1.54\n |\n| 1984\n | 56,577,000\n | 597,560\n | 535,661\n | 61,899\n | 10.4\n | 9.5\n | 0.9\n | -0.6\n | 1.48\n |\n| 1985\n | 56,593,000\n | 589,233\n | 549,529\n | 39,704\n | 10.2\n | 9.7\n | 0.5\n | -0.4\n | 1.45\n |\n| 1986\n | 56,596,000\n | 562,512\n | 545,189\n | 17,323\n | 9.8\n | 9.5\n | 0.3\n | -0.2\n | 1.37\n |\n| 1987\n | 56,602,000\n | 560,265\n | 534,993\n | 25,272\n | 9.7\n | 9.3\n | 0.5\n | 0\n | 1.35\n |\n| 1988\n | 56,629,000\n | 577,856\n | 537,545\n | 40,311\n | 10.1\n | 9.5\n | 0.5\n | 0.3\n | 1.38\n |\n| 1989\n | 56,672,000\n | 567,268\n | 531,557\n | 35,711\n | 9.9\n | 9.4\n | 0.5\n | 0.3\n | 1.35\n |\n| 1990\n | 56,719,000\n | 580,761\n | 544,397\n | 36,364\n | 10.0\n | 9.6\n | 0.5\n | 0.2\n | 1.36\n |\n| 1991\n | 56,759,000\n | 556,175\n | 547,131\n | 9,044\n | 9.9\n | 9.8\n | 0.2\n | 0.5\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 53,821,000\n | 917,496\n | 528,622\n | 388,874\n | 16.8\n | 9.7\n | 7.1\n | -2.4\n | 2.43\n |\n| 1971\n | 54,073,000\n | 911,084\n | 515,318\n | 395,766\n | 16.8\n | 9.7\n | 7.1\n | -1.4\n | 2.41\n |\n| 1972\n | 54,381,000\n | 893,061\n | 518,020\n | 375,041\n | 16.3\n | 9.6\n | 6.7\n | 0.1\n | 2.36\n |\n| 1973\n | 54,751,000\n | 887,953\n | 544,461\n | 343,492\n | 16.0\n | 10.0\n | 6.0\n | 0.6\n | 2.34\n |\n| 1974\n | 55,111,000\n | 886,310\n | 532,753\n | 353,557\n | 15.8\n | 9.7\n | 6.1\n | -0.1\n | 2.33\n |\n| 1975\n | 55,441,000\n | 841,858\n | 556,019\n | 285,839\n | 14.9\n | 10.0\n | 4.9\n | 0.1\n | 2.21\n |\n| 1976\n | 55,718,000\n | 806,358\n | 556,143\n | 250,215\n | 14.0\n | 9.9\n | 4.1\n | 0.2\n | 2.11\n |\n| 1977\n | 55,955,000\n | 757,281\n | 547,011\n | 210,270\n | 13.2\n | 9.8\n | 3.5\n | 0.1\n | 1.97\n |\n| 1978\n | 56,155,000\n | 720,545\n | 539,685\n | 180,860\n | 12.6\n | 9.6\n | 3.0\n | -0.1\n | 1.87\n |\n| 1979\n | 56,318,000\n | 682,742\n | 541,825\n | 140,917\n | 11.9\n | 9.6\n | 2.3\n | -0.2\n | 1.76\n |\n| 1980\n | 56,434,000\n | 657,278\n | 559,376\n | 97,902\n | 11.3\n | 9.8\n | 1.5\n | -0.3\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the year 2021 85,878 babies were born to at least one foreign parent which makes up 21.5% of all newborns in that year (20,628 or 5.2% were born to foreign fathers, 8,324 or 2.1% to foreign mothers and 56,926 or 14.2% to two foreign parents.[58]\n\n\n\n### Current vital statistics[edit]\n\n\n[59]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Period\n | Live births\n | Deaths\n | Natural increase\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **January — August 2022** | 254,474\n | 483,482\n | -229,008\n |\n| **January — August 2023** | 246,520\n | 436,975\n | -190,455\n |\n| **Difference** | ![Decrease](image) -7,954 (-3.05%)\n | ![Positive decrease](image) -46,507 (-9.62%)\n | ![Increase](image) +38,583\n |\n\n\n### Structure of the population[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Animated population pyramid 1982–2021.

At the end of the late 2000s, one in five Italians were over 65 years old.[4] Italy has experienced a short growth in birth rates.[5] The total fertility rate temporarily rose from an all-time low of 1.18 children per woman in 1995 to 1.46 in 2010.[6] Since then, fertility rates continued to drop, to reach a low of 1.24 in 2020.\n\n\nSince the revision of the Lateran Treaty in 1984, Italy has no official religion, although it continues to recognize the role the Catholic Church plays in Italian society. In 2017, 78% of the population identified as Catholic, 15% as non-believers or atheists, 2% as other Christians and 6% adhered to other religions.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## Historical overview[edit]\n\n\n### 1861 to early 20th century[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Italian diaspora\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 10.0\n | -1.4\n | 10.6\n | 1.39\n |\n| 2014\n | 60,789,000\n | 502,596\n | 598,364\n | -95,768\n | 8.3\n | 9.9\n | -1.6\n | 1.7\n | 1.37\n |\n| 2015\n | 60,796,000\n | 485,780\n | 647,571\n | -161,791\n | 8.1\n | 10.7\n | -2.7\n | 0.6\n | 1.35\n |\n| 2016\n | 60,666,000\n | 473,438\n | 615,261\n | -141,823\n | 7.9\n | 10.2\n | -2.4\n | 1.0\n | 1.34\n |\n| 2017\n | 60,579,000\n | 458,151\n | 649,061\n | -190,910\n | 7.6\n | 10.8\n | -3.2\n | 1.6\n | 1.32\n |\n| 2018\n | 60,484,000\n | 439,747\n | 633,133\n | -193,386\n | 7.3\n | 10.6\n | -3.2\n | -7.8\n | 1.29\n |\n| 2019\n | 59,816,673 [57] | 420,084\n | 634,417\n | -214,333\n | 7.0\n | 10.6\n | -3.6\n | 0.7\n | 1.27\n |\n| 2020\n | 59,641,488\n | 404,892\n | 740,317\n | -335,425\n | 6.8\n | 12.4\n | -5.6\n | -1.2\n | 1.24\n |\n| 2021\n | 59,236,213\n | 400,249\n | 701,346\n | -301,097\n | 6.8\n | 11.8\n | -5.2\n | 1.7\n | 1.25\n |\n| 2022\n | 59,030,133\n | 392,598\n | 713,499\n | -320,901\n | 6.7\n | 12.1\n | -5.4\n | 2.4\n | 1.24\n |\n| 2023\n | 58,850,717\n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2021, Istat estimated that 5,171,894 foreign citizens lived in Italy, representing about 8.7% of the total population.[32] These figures do not include naturalized foreign-born residents (121,457 foreigners acquired Italian citizenship in 2021)[65] as well as illegal immigrants, the so-called *clandestini*, whose numbers, difficult to determine, are thought to be at least 670,000.[66] Romanians made up the largest community in the country (1,145,718; around 10% of them being ethnic Romani people[67]), followed by Albanians (441,027) and Moroccans (422,980).[68][69]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nurban population: 71% of total population (2020)\nrate of urbanization: 0.29% annual rate of change (2015–20 est.)\n![](image)Map of Italy's population density at the 2011 census\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | -2.5\n | 3.55\n |\n| 1928\n | 40,281,000\n | 1,072,316\n | 645,654\n | 426,662\n | 26.6\n | 16.0\n | 10.6\n | -2.5\n | 3.46\n |\n| 1929\n | 40,607,000\n | 1,037,700\n | 667,223\n | 370,477\n | 25.6\n | 16.4\n | 9.1\n | -0.5\n | 3.42\n |\n| 1930\n | 40,956,000\n | 1,092,678\n | 576,751\n | 515,927\n | 26.7\n | 14.1\n | 12.6\n | -3.2\n | 3.38\n |\n| 1931\n | 41,339,000\n | 1,026,197\n | 609,405\n | 416,792\n | 24.8\n | 14.7\n | 10.1\n | -4.2\n | 3.21\n |\n| 1932\n | 41,584,000\n | 990,995\n | 610,646\n | 380,349\n | 23.8\n | 14.7\n | 9.1\n | -0.8\n | 3.06\n |\n| 1933\n | 41,928,000\n | 995,979\n | 574,113\n | 421,866\n | 23.8\n | 13.7\n | 10.1\n | -1.8\n | 3.04\n |\n| 1934\n | 42,277,000\n | 992,966\n | 563,339\n | 429,627\n | 23.5\n | 13.3\n | 10.2\n | -1.8\n | 3.00\n |\n| 1935\n | 42,631,000\n | 996,708\n | 594,722\n | 401,986\n | 23.4\n | 14.0\n | 9.4\n | -1.6\n | 2.98\n |\n| 1936\n | 42,965,000\n | 962,686\n | 593,380\n | 369,306\n | 22.4\n | 13.8\n | 8.6\n | -1.5\n | 2.87\n |\n| 1937\n | 43,269,000\n | 991,867\n | 618,290\n | 373,577\n | 22.9\n | 14.3\n | 8.6\n | -1.0\n | 2.93\n |\n| 1938\n | 43,596,000\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n27. **^** James M.

As of 2009, there were 1.0 million Muslims in Italy[111] forming 1.6 percent of population; independent estimates put the Islamic population in Italy anywhere from 0.8 million[112] to 1.5 million.[113] 50,000 Italian Muslims hold Italian citizenship.\n\n\nThere are more than 200,000 followers of faiths originating in the Indian subcontinent, including some 70,000 Sikhs with 22 gurdwaras across the country,[114] 70,000 Hindus, and 50,000 Buddhists.[115] There were an estimated 4,900 Bahá'ís in Italy in 2005.[116]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\n**Literacy**\n\n\n\n\n*definition:* age 15 and over can read and write\ntotal population: 99.2%\nmale: 99.4%\nfemale: 99% (2018 est.)\n**School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)**\n\n\n\n\ntotal: 16 years\nmale: 16 years\nfemale: 17 years (2018)\n## Genetics and ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Genetic history of Italy\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMost Italians believe in God, or a form of a spiritual life force. According to a Eurobarometer Poll in 2005:[101] 74% of Italian citizens responded that 'they believe there is a God', 16% answered that 'they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force' and 6% answered that 'they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, God, or life force'. There are no data collected through census.\n\n\n\n### Christianity[edit]\n\n\nThe Italian Catholic Church is part of the global Roman Catholic Church, under the leadership of the Pope, curia in Rome, and the Conference of Italian Bishops. In addition to Italy, two other sovereign nations are included in Italian-based dioceses, San Marino and Vatican City. There are 225 dioceses in the Italian Catholic Church, see further in this article and in the article List of the Roman Catholic dioceses in Italy. Even though by law Vatican City is not part of Italy, it is in Rome, and along with Latin, Italian is the most spoken and second language of the Roman Curia.[102]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n3E), as well as a further increase in the European cluster (C7) and loss of the Near Eastern and eastern Mediterranean clusters (C4 and C5) in ChromoPainter (Fig. 4C). The Medieval population is roughly centered on modern-day central Italians (Fig. 3F). It can be modeled as a two-way combination of Rome's Late Antique population and a European donor population, with potential sources including many ancient and modern populations in central and northern Europe: Lombards from Hungary, Saxons from England, and Vikings from Sweden, among others (table S26).\n119. **^** Ralph P, Coop G (2013). \"The geography of recent genetic ancestry across Europe\". *PLOS Biology*. **11** (5): e1001555. doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.1001555.

Roman Catholic art in Italy especially flourished during the Middle Ages, Renaissance and Baroque periods, with numerous Italian artists, such as Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Caravaggio, Fra Angelico, Gian Lorenzo Bernini, Sandro Botticelli, Tintoretto, Titian and Giotto. Roman Catholic architecture in Italy is equally as rich and impressive, with churches, basilicas and cathedrals such as St Peter's Basilica, Florence Cathedral and St Mark's Basilica. Roman Catholicism is the largest religion and denomination in Italy, with around 71.1% of Italians considering themselves Catholic. Italy is also home to the greatest number of cardinals in the world,[103] and is the country with the greatest number of Roman Catholic churches per capita.[104]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Being Christian in Western Europe\" (PDF).

Its development was also influenced by the Germanic languages of the post-Roman invaders. When Italy unified in 1861, only 3% of the population spoke Italian,[89] even though an estimated 90% of Italians speak Italian as their L1 nowadays.[90]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLinguistic minorities in Italy include Sardu-speakers 1 million, Tyrolese German-speakers 350,000, Albanians 70,000 – 100,000, Slovenes 60,000, Franco-Provençal-speakers 50,000 – 70,000, Occitans 20,000 – 40,000, Ladins 30,000, Catalans 15,000, Greek-speakers 12,000, Croatians 3,000 and Friulians 600,000. The Roma community is one of the largest ethnic minorities in Italy. Due to the lack of disaggregated data the size of the Italian Roma community remains unknown. The Council of Europe estimates that between 120,000 and 180,000 Roma live in Italy. A significant proportion of Roma in Italy don’t have Italian citizenship.[124]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Italy portal\n\n\n* List of Italians\n* Italian diaspora\n* Italian Americans\n* Italian Brazilians\n* Italian Argentines\n* Italian Venezuelans\n* Romani people in Italy\n\n\n## Footnotes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_ysAQjXjLFqMim8fEMcJJwfnS","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

In addition, after centuries of net emigration, from the 1980s Italy has experienced large-scale immigration for the first time in modern history. Italian government data, in its annual report for 2019, estimated the amount of foreign nationals residing within Italy, including immigrants, to be at approximately 5.234 million people.[3] Due to such large-scale immigration to the country, particularly from the early 2000s to 2014, the population peaked at 60.79 million. Since then, decreasing migration, a continuously falling birth rate, and continuous aging have led to a sharp decrease in the Italian population.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% p.a. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1861  | 21,777,334 | —     |\n| 1871  | 26,801,154 | +2.10% |\n| 1881  | 28,459,628 | +0.60% |\n| 1901  | 32,475,253 | +0.66% |\n| 1911  | 34,671,377 | +0.66% |\n| 1921  | 37,973,977 | +0.91% |\n| 1931  | 41,176,671 | +0.81% |\n| 1936  | 42,993,602 | +0.87% |\n| 1951  | 47,515,537 | +0.67% |\n| 1961  | 50,623,569 | +0.64% |\n| 1971  | 54,136,547 | +0.67% |\n| 1981  | 56,556,911 | +0.44% |\n| 1991  | 56,778,031 | +0.04% |\n| 2001  | 56,995,744 | +0.04% |\n| 2011  | 59,433,744 | +0.42% |\n| 2021 (est.)  | 59,257,566 | −0.03% |\n| Source: ISTAT[39][40][32] |\n\n\nFurther information: Italians\n\nDemographic statistics according to the World Population Review in 2022.[41]\n\n\n\n* One birth every 1 minute 18 seconds\n* One death every 50 seconds\n* Net loss of one person every 3 minutes 6 seconds\n* One net migrant every 9 minutes\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 1.68\n |\n| 1981\n | 56,502,000\n | 628,113\n | 540,764\n | 87,349\n | 11.0\n | 9.7\n | 1.4\n | -0.7\n | 1.60\n |\n| 1982\n | 56,544,000\n | 634,678\n | 537,727\n | 96,951\n | 10.9\n | 9.5\n | 1.5\n | -1.1\n | 1.60\n |\n| 1983\n | 56,564,000\n | 612,936\n | 563,807\n | 49,129\n | 10.6\n | 10.0\n | 0.7\n | -0.5\n | 1.54\n |\n| 1984\n | 56,577,000\n | 597,560\n | 535,661\n | 61,899\n | 10.4\n | 9.5\n | 0.9\n | -0.6\n | 1.48\n |\n| 1985\n | 56,593,000\n | 589,233\n | 549,529\n | 39,704\n | 10.2\n | 9.7\n | 0.5\n | -0.4\n | 1.45\n |\n| 1986\n | 56,596,000\n | 562,512\n | 545,189\n | 17,323\n | 9.8\n | 9.5\n | 0.3\n | -0.2\n | 1.37\n |\n| 1987\n | 56,602,000\n | 560,265\n | 534,993\n | 25,272\n | 9.7\n | 9.3\n | 0.5\n | 0\n | 1.35\n |\n| 1988\n | 56,629,000\n | 577,856\n | 537,545\n | 40,311\n | 10.1\n | 9.5\n | 0.5\n | 0.3\n | 1.38\n |\n| 1989\n | 56,672,000\n | 567,268\n | 531,557\n | 35,711\n | 9.9\n | 9.4\n | 0.5\n | 0.3\n | 1.35\n |\n| 1990\n | 56,719,000\n | 580,761\n | 544,397\n | 36,364\n | 10.0\n | 9.6\n | 0.5\n | 0.2\n | 1.36\n |\n| 1991\n | 56,759,000\n | 556,175\n | 547,131\n | 9,044\n | 9.9\n | 9.8\n | 0.2\n | 0.5\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 53,821,000\n | 917,496\n | 528,622\n | 388,874\n | 16.8\n | 9.7\n | 7.1\n | -2.4\n | 2.43\n |\n| 1971\n | 54,073,000\n | 911,084\n | 515,318\n | 395,766\n | 16.8\n | 9.7\n | 7.1\n | -1.4\n | 2.41\n |\n| 1972\n | 54,381,000\n | 893,061\n | 518,020\n | 375,041\n | 16.3\n | 9.6\n | 6.7\n | 0.1\n | 2.36\n |\n| 1973\n | 54,751,000\n | 887,953\n | 544,461\n | 343,492\n | 16.0\n | 10.0\n | 6.0\n | 0.6\n | 2.34\n |\n| 1974\n | 55,111,000\n | 886,310\n | 532,753\n | 353,557\n | 15.8\n | 9.7\n | 6.1\n | -0.1\n | 2.33\n |\n| 1975\n | 55,441,000\n | 841,858\n | 556,019\n | 285,839\n | 14.9\n | 10.0\n | 4.9\n | 0.1\n | 2.21\n |\n| 1976\n | 55,718,000\n | 806,358\n | 556,143\n | 250,215\n | 14.0\n | 9.9\n | 4.1\n | 0.2\n | 2.11\n |\n| 1977\n | 55,955,000\n | 757,281\n | 547,011\n | 210,270\n | 13.2\n | 9.8\n | 3.5\n | 0.1\n | 1.97\n |\n| 1978\n | 56,155,000\n | 720,545\n | 539,685\n | 180,860\n | 12.6\n | 9.6\n | 3.0\n | -0.1\n | 1.87\n |\n| 1979\n | 56,318,000\n | 682,742\n | 541,825\n | 140,917\n | 11.9\n | 9.6\n | 2.3\n | -0.2\n | 1.76\n |\n| 1980\n | 56,434,000\n | 657,278\n | 559,376\n | 97,902\n | 11.3\n | 9.8\n | 1.5\n | -0.3\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the year 2021 85,878 babies were born to at least one foreign parent which makes up 21.5% of all newborns in that year (20,628 or 5.2% were born to foreign fathers, 8,324 or 2.1% to foreign mothers and 56,926 or 14.2% to two foreign parents.[58]\n\n\n\n### Current vital statistics[edit]\n\n\n[59]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Period\n | Live births\n | Deaths\n | Natural increase\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **January — August 2022** | 254,474\n | 483,482\n | -229,008\n |\n| **January — August 2023** | 246,520\n | 436,975\n | -190,455\n |\n| **Difference** | ![Decrease](image) -7,954 (-3.05%)\n | ![Positive decrease](image) -46,507 (-9.62%)\n | ![Increase](image) +38,583\n |\n\n\n### Structure of the population[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Animated population pyramid 1982–2021.

At the end of the late 2000s, one in five Italians were over 65 years old.[4] Italy has experienced a short growth in birth rates.[5] The total fertility rate temporarily rose from an all-time low of 1.18 children per woman in 1995 to 1.46 in 2010.[6] Since then, fertility rates continued to drop, to reach a low of 1.24 in 2020.\n\n\nSince the revision of the Lateran Treaty in 1984, Italy has no official religion, although it continues to recognize the role the Catholic Church plays in Italian society. In 2017, 78% of the population identified as Catholic, 15% as non-believers or atheists, 2% as other Christians and 6% adhered to other religions.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## Historical overview[edit]\n\n\n### 1861 to early 20th century[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Italian diaspora\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 10.0\n | -1.4\n | 10.6\n | 1.39\n |\n| 2014\n | 60,789,000\n | 502,596\n | 598,364\n | -95,768\n | 8.3\n | 9.9\n | -1.6\n | 1.7\n | 1.37\n |\n| 2015\n | 60,796,000\n | 485,780\n | 647,571\n | -161,791\n | 8.1\n | 10.7\n | -2.7\n | 0.6\n | 1.35\n |\n| 2016\n | 60,666,000\n | 473,438\n | 615,261\n | -141,823\n | 7.9\n | 10.2\n | -2.4\n | 1.0\n | 1.34\n |\n| 2017\n | 60,579,000\n | 458,151\n | 649,061\n | -190,910\n | 7.6\n | 10.8\n | -3.2\n | 1.6\n | 1.32\n |\n| 2018\n | 60,484,000\n | 439,747\n | 633,133\n | -193,386\n | 7.3\n | 10.6\n | -3.2\n | -7.8\n | 1.29\n |\n| 2019\n | 59,816,673 [57] | 420,084\n | 634,417\n | -214,333\n | 7.0\n | 10.6\n | -3.6\n | 0.7\n | 1.27\n |\n| 2020\n | 59,641,488\n | 404,892\n | 740,317\n | -335,425\n | 6.8\n | 12.4\n | -5.6\n | -1.2\n | 1.24\n |\n| 2021\n | 59,236,213\n | 400,249\n | 701,346\n | -301,097\n | 6.8\n | 11.8\n | -5.2\n | 1.7\n | 1.25\n |\n| 2022\n | 59,030,133\n | 392,598\n | 713,499\n | -320,901\n | 6.7\n | 12.1\n | -5.4\n | 2.4\n | 1.24\n |\n| 2023\n | 58,850,717\n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2021, Istat estimated that 5,171,894 foreign citizens lived in Italy, representing about 8.7% of the total population.[32] These figures do not include naturalized foreign-born residents (121,457 foreigners acquired Italian citizenship in 2021)[65] as well as illegal immigrants, the so-called *clandestini*, whose numbers, difficult to determine, are thought to be at least 670,000.[66] Romanians made up the largest community in the country (1,145,718; around 10% of them being ethnic Romani people[67]), followed by Albanians (441,027) and Moroccans (422,980).[68][69]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nurban population: 71% of total population (2020)\nrate of urbanization: 0.29% annual rate of change (2015–20 est.)\n![](image)Map of Italy's population density at the 2011 census\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | -2.5\n | 3.55\n |\n| 1928\n | 40,281,000\n | 1,072,316\n | 645,654\n | 426,662\n | 26.6\n | 16.0\n | 10.6\n | -2.5\n | 3.46\n |\n| 1929\n | 40,607,000\n | 1,037,700\n | 667,223\n | 370,477\n | 25.6\n | 16.4\n | 9.1\n | -0.5\n | 3.42\n |\n| 1930\n | 40,956,000\n | 1,092,678\n | 576,751\n | 515,927\n | 26.7\n | 14.1\n | 12.6\n | -3.2\n | 3.38\n |\n| 1931\n | 41,339,000\n | 1,026,197\n | 609,405\n | 416,792\n | 24.8\n | 14.7\n | 10.1\n | -4.2\n | 3.21\n |\n| 1932\n | 41,584,000\n | 990,995\n | 610,646\n | 380,349\n | 23.8\n | 14.7\n | 9.1\n | -0.8\n | 3.06\n |\n| 1933\n | 41,928,000\n | 995,979\n | 574,113\n | 421,866\n | 23.8\n | 13.7\n | 10.1\n | -1.8\n | 3.04\n |\n| 1934\n | 42,277,000\n | 992,966\n | 563,339\n | 429,627\n | 23.5\n | 13.3\n | 10.2\n | -1.8\n | 3.00\n |\n| 1935\n | 42,631,000\n | 996,708\n | 594,722\n | 401,986\n | 23.4\n | 14.0\n | 9.4\n | -1.6\n | 2.98\n |\n| 1936\n | 42,965,000\n | 962,686\n | 593,380\n | 369,306\n | 22.4\n | 13.8\n | 8.6\n | -1.5\n | 2.87\n |\n| 1937\n | 43,269,000\n | 991,867\n | 618,290\n | 373,577\n | 22.9\n | 14.3\n | 8.6\n | -1.0\n | 2.93\n |\n| 1938\n | 43,596,000\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n27. **^** James M.

As of 2009, there were 1.0 million Muslims in Italy[111] forming 1.6 percent of population; independent estimates put the Islamic population in Italy anywhere from 0.8 million[112] to 1.5 million.[113] 50,000 Italian Muslims hold Italian citizenship.\n\n\nThere are more than 200,000 followers of faiths originating in the Indian subcontinent, including some 70,000 Sikhs with 22 gurdwaras across the country,[114] 70,000 Hindus, and 50,000 Buddhists.[115] There were an estimated 4,900 Bahá'ís in Italy in 2005.[116]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\n**Literacy**\n\n\n\n\n*definition:* age 15 and over can read and write\ntotal population: 99.2%\nmale: 99.4%\nfemale: 99% (2018 est.)\n**School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)**\n\n\n\n\ntotal: 16 years\nmale: 16 years\nfemale: 17 years (2018)\n## Genetics and ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Genetic history of Italy\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMost Italians believe in God, or a form of a spiritual life force. According to a Eurobarometer Poll in 2005:[101] 74% of Italian citizens responded that 'they believe there is a God', 16% answered that 'they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force' and 6% answered that 'they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, God, or life force'. There are no data collected through census.\n\n\n\n### Christianity[edit]\n\n\nThe Italian Catholic Church is part of the global Roman Catholic Church, under the leadership of the Pope, curia in Rome, and the Conference of Italian Bishops. In addition to Italy, two other sovereign nations are included in Italian-based dioceses, San Marino and Vatican City. There are 225 dioceses in the Italian Catholic Church, see further in this article and in the article List of the Roman Catholic dioceses in Italy. Even though by law Vatican City is not part of Italy, it is in Rome, and along with Latin, Italian is the most spoken and second language of the Roman Curia.[102]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n3E), as well as a further increase in the European cluster (C7) and loss of the Near Eastern and eastern Mediterranean clusters (C4 and C5) in ChromoPainter (Fig. 4C). The Medieval population is roughly centered on modern-day central Italians (Fig. 3F). It can be modeled as a two-way combination of Rome's Late Antique population and a European donor population, with potential sources including many ancient and modern populations in central and northern Europe: Lombards from Hungary, Saxons from England, and Vikings from Sweden, among others (table S26).\n119. **^** Ralph P, Coop G (2013). \"The geography of recent genetic ancestry across Europe\". *PLOS Biology*. **11** (5): e1001555. doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.1001555.

Roman Catholic art in Italy especially flourished during the Middle Ages, Renaissance and Baroque periods, with numerous Italian artists, such as Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Caravaggio, Fra Angelico, Gian Lorenzo Bernini, Sandro Botticelli, Tintoretto, Titian and Giotto. Roman Catholic architecture in Italy is equally as rich and impressive, with churches, basilicas and cathedrals such as St Peter's Basilica, Florence Cathedral and St Mark's Basilica. Roman Catholicism is the largest religion and denomination in Italy, with around 71.1% of Italians considering themselves Catholic. Italy is also home to the greatest number of cardinals in the world,[103] and is the country with the greatest number of Roman Catholic churches per capita.[104]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Being Christian in Western Europe\" (PDF).

Its development was also influenced by the Germanic languages of the post-Roman invaders. When Italy unified in 1861, only 3% of the population spoke Italian,[89] even though an estimated 90% of Italians speak Italian as their L1 nowadays.[90]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLinguistic minorities in Italy include Sardu-speakers 1 million, Tyrolese German-speakers 350,000, Albanians 70,000 – 100,000, Slovenes 60,000, Franco-Provençal-speakers 50,000 – 70,000, Occitans 20,000 – 40,000, Ladins 30,000, Catalans 15,000, Greek-speakers 12,000, Croatians 3,000 and Friulians 600,000. The Roma community is one of the largest ethnic minorities in Italy. Due to the lack of disaggregated data the size of the Italian Roma community remains unknown. The Council of Europe estimates that between 120,000 and 180,000 Roma live in Italy. A significant proportion of Roma in Italy don’t have Italian citizenship.[124]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Italy portal\n\n\n* List of Italians\n* Italian diaspora\n* Italian Americans\n* Italian Brazilians\n* Italian Argentines\n* Italian Venezuelans\n* Romani people in Italy\n\n\n## Footnotes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_ysAQjXjLFqMim8fEMcJJwfnS","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

The population density is 16.5 persons per square kilometer - well below the world average of 62 persons. Argentina's population growth rate in 2020 was estimated to be 0.35% annually, with a birth rate of 11.8 per 1,000 inhabitants and a mortality rate of 8.3 per 1,000 inhabitants.\n\n\nThe proportion of people under 15, at 23,5%, is slightly below the world average (25%), and the cohort of people 65 and older is relatively high, at 12.7%. The percentage of senior citizens in Argentina has long been second only to Uruguay in Latin America and well above the world average, which is currently 9.8%.\n\n\nThe median age is approximately 32 years and life expectancy at birth is of 78 years.[7] According to an official cultural consumption survey conducted in 2006, 42.3% of Argentines speak English (though only 15.4% of those claimed to have a high level of English comprehension), 9.3% speak Portuguese[8] and 5.9% speak Italian.[9]\n\n\n\n\n## Cities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of cities in Argentina by population\n\nArgentina is highly urbanized,[7] with the ten largest metropolitan areas accounting for half of the population, and fewer than one in ten living in rural areas. About 3 million people live in Buenos Aires proper, and including suburban Greater Buenos Aires the metropolitan area totals around 14 million - making it one of the 15 largest urban areas in the world.[10] The metropolitan areas of Córdoba and Rosario have around 1.3 million inhabitants each,[10] and six other cities (Mendoza, Tucumán, La Plata, Mar del Plata, Salta and Santa Fe)[10][11] have at least half a million people each.\n\n\nThe population is unequally distributed amongst the provinces, with 61% living in the Pampa region (21% of the total area), including 17.5 million people in Buenos Aires Province, 4 million in Córdoba Province, and over 3 million each in Santa Fe Province and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. Eight other provinces each have over one million people: Mendoza, Tucumán, Salta, Entre Ríos, Misiones, Corrientes, Chaco, and Santiago del Estero. Tucumán is the most densely populated (with 75 inhabitants/km2, the only Argentine province more densely populated than the world average), while the southern province of Santa Cruz has just 1.4 inhabitant/km2.[12]\n\n\nIn the mid-19th century, a large wave of immigration started to arrive to Argentina due to new constitutional policies that encouraged immigration, and issues in the countries the immigrants came from such as wars, poverty, hunger, famines, pursuit of a better life, among other reasons. The main immigration sources were from Europe, the countries from the Near and Middle East, Russia and Japan. In fact, the immigration torrent was so strong that Argentina eventually received the second-largest number of immigrants in the world, second only to the US and ahead of such immigrant receptor countries such as Canada, Brazil, Australia, etc.[13][14]\n\n\nMost of these European immigrants settled in the cities which offered jobs, education and other opportunities enabling them to enter the middle class. Many also settled in the growing small towns along the expanding railway system and since the 1930s many rural workers have moved to the big cities.[15]\n\n\nUrban areas reflect the influence of European immigration, and most of the larger ones feature boulevards and diagonal avenues inspired by the redevelopment of Paris. Argentine cities were originally built in a colonial Spanish grid style, centered on a plaza overlooked by a cathedral and important government buildings. Many still retain this general layout, known as a *damero*, meaning checkerboard, since it is based on a pattern of square blocks. The city of La Plata, designed at the end of the 19th century by Pedro Benoit, combines the checkerboard layout with added diagonal avenues at fixed intervals, and was the first in South America with electric street lighting.[16]\n\n\n\n### Provinces and districts[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Flag\n | Province/District\n | Capital\n | Population (2022)[1] | Rank | Density (/km2)[1] | Avg. growth from 2010

in Argentina during the past century. Several sources were combined to compile the table.[19][20][21]\n\n\nThe number of births in 2021 (529,794) was 32% below the record set in 2014, while the number of deaths (436,799) was the highest ever recorded[2] - though as the population of Argentina showed a five-fold increase during the past century, the birth rate in 2021 (11.6) was a record low while the death rate (9.5) rose to its highest since 1947 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[2]\n\n\nBirth rates were relatively stable from 1934 through 1980,[19] and after declining stabilized from 1995 to 2015 - before again declining sharply since then.[21]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Average population\n | Live births\n | Deaths\n | Natural change\n | Crude birth rate(per 1000) | Crude death rate(per 1000) | Natural change(per 1000) | Total

revision of the World Population Prospects[23][24] the total population was 45,276,780 in 2021 - double the number in 1966 (for a 1.27% average annual growth rate in that period). The population below the age of 15 in 2023 was 23.5%, 63.8% was between 15 and 64, while 12.7% was 65 or older.[3]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

Before the middle 19th century, the ethnic make up of Argentina was very similar to that of other countries of Latin America.[30][31][32][33] Between 1857 and 1950 Argentina was the country with the second biggest immigration wave in the world, at 6.6 million, second only to the United States in the numbers of immigrants received (27 million) and ahead of other areas of new settlement like Canada, Brazil and Australia.[34][35] However, mass European immigration did not have the same impact in the whole country. According to the 1914 national census, 30% of Argentina's population was foreign-born, including 50% of the people in the city of Buenos Aires, but foreigners were only 2% in the provinces of Catamarca and La Rioja (North West region).[31] Strikingly, at those times, the national population doubled every two decades. This belief is endured in the popular saying *\"los argentinos descienden de los barcos\"* (Argentines descend from the ships). Therefore, most Argentines are descended from the 19th- and 20th-century immigrants of the great European immigration wave to Argentina (1850–1955),[36] with a great majority of these immigrants coming from diverse European countries, particularly Italy and Spain.[13]\n\n\n\nCultural ethnic groups in the late 20th century in Argentina according to the UAEM[5]\n\n\n\nEuropean (85.0%)\nMestizo (11.4%)\nAsian and Arab (2.2%)\nAmerindian (1.0%)\nAfrican and Mulatto (0.4%)\n\nGenetic ancestry of the Argentine gene pool according to a study, using X-DIPs (matrilineal).[37]\n\n\n\nEuropean Contribution (52.9%)\nAmerindian Contribution (39.6%)\nAfrican Contribution (7.5%)\n\nGenetic ancestry of the mixed Argentines autosomal gene pool[37]\n\n\n\nEuropean Contribution (77.8%)\nAmerindian Contribution (17.9%)\nAfrican Contribution (4.2%)\n\nEthnic groupings in Argentina (2022 est.)[7]\n\n\n\nEuropean and Mestizo (97.2%)\nAmerindian (2.4%)\nAfrican (0.4%)\n\n### Indigenous peoples[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Argentine Amerindians\n\n![](image)Distribution of the Indigenous Peoples in Argentina and The Falkland Islands (British Overseas Territory)\nAccording to the data of INDEC's Complementary Survey of Indigenous Peoples (ECPI) 2004–2005, 600,000 officially recognized indigenous persons (about 1.4% of the total population) reside in Argentina. The most numerous of these communities are the Mapuches, who live mostly in the south, the Kollas and Wichís, from the northwest, and the Guaranis and Qom, who live mostly in the northeast.[38]\nIn the census of 2010, 955,032 people self recognized as indigenous or descendants of indigenous peoples, thus representing 2.4% of the national population. This is without prejudice that more than half of the population has at least one indigenous ancestor, although in most cases family memory lost that origin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Indigenous population of Argentina**\n| Ethnicgroup\n | Survey 2004–2005\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Number\n | %\n |\n| Aonikenk | 10,590 | 1.8\n |\n| Atacama | 3,044 | 0.5\n |\n| Avá-Guaraní | 21,807 | 3.6\n |\n| Aymara | 4,104 | 0.7\n |\n| Chané | 4,376 | 0.7\n |\n| Charrúa | 4,511 | 0.7\n |\n| Chorote | 2,613 | 0.4\n |\n| Chulupí | 553 | 0.1\n |\n| Comechingón | 10,863 | 1.8\n |\n| Diaguita/diaguita calchaquí | 31,753 | 5.3\n |\n| Guaraní | 22,059 | 3.7\n |\n| Het | 736 | 0.1\n |\n| Huarpe | 14,633 | 2.4\n |\n| Kolla | 70,505 | 11.7\n |\n| Lule | 854 | 0.1\n |\n| Mapuche | 113,680 | 18.8\n |\n| Mbyá | 8,223 | 1.4\n |\n| Mocoví | 15,837 | 2.6\n |\n| Omaguaca | 1,553 | 0.3\n |\n| Pilagá | 4,465 | 0.7\n |\n| Puelche | 1,585 | 0.3\n |\n| Qom | 69,452 | 11.5\n |\n| Quechua | 6,739 | 1.1\n |\n| Rankulche | 10,149 | 1.7\n |\n| Sanavirón | 563 | 0.1\n |\n| Selknam | 696 | 0.1\n |\n| Tapiete | 524 | 0.1\n |\n| Tonocoté | 4,779 | 0.8\n |\n| Wichí | 40,036 | 6.6\n |\n| Others | 3,864 | 0.6\n |\n| Not specified | 102,247 | 16.0\n |\n\n\n### Afro-Argentines[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Afro-Argentines\n\n![](image)Santiago Lovell, Argentine boxer and gold medalist at the 1932 Summer Olympics\nSince 2013, November 8 has been celebrated as the National Day of Afro-Argentines and African Culture. The date was chosen to commemorate the recorded date for the death of María Remedios del Valle, a *rabona* and guerrilla fighter, who served with the Army of the North in the war of Independence.[39][40]\n\n\nThe black population in Argentina declined since the middle 19th century from 15% of the total population in 1857 (Blacks and Mulatto people), to less than 0.5% at present (mainly mulattoes and immigrants from Cape Verde).\n\n\nAfro-Argentines were up to a third of the population during colonial times; most were slaves brought from Africa to work for the criollos. The 1813 Assembly abolished slavery and led to the Freedom of Wombs Law of 1813, which automatically freed slaves' children at birth. Many Afro-Argentines contributed to the independence of Argentina such as María Remedios del Valle who is known as \"La Madre de la Patria\" (mother of the fatherland in English) and Sgt. Juan Bautista Cabral. Also there is a debate, among the historians, as to whether or not Bernardino Rivadavia, the first president of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata (Present Argentina) had African ancestors.[41]\n\n\n\n### Immigration to Argentina[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Immigration to Argentina\n\n#### European settlement[edit]\n\n\nAs with other areas of new settlement such as Canada, Australia, the United States, Brazil, and New Zealand, Argentina is considered a country of immigrants.[42] When it is considered that Argentina was second only to the United States (27 million of immigrants) in the number of immigrants received, even ahead of such other areas of new settlement like Canada, Brazil and Australia;[34][35] and that the country was scarcely populated following its independence, the impact of the immigration to Argentina becomes evident.[34][35]\n\n\nIn the last national census, based on self-identification, 952,032 Argentines (2.4% of the population) declared to be Amerindians.[38] Most of the 6.2 million European immigrants arriving between 1850 and 1950, regardless of origin, settled in several regions of the country. Due to this large-scale European immigration, Argentina's population more than doubled.\n\n\n\n![](image)Immigrant population in Argentina (1869–1991)\nThe majority of these European immigrants came from Spain and Italy.\nThousands of immigrants also came from France, Germany, England, Portugal, Brazil, Switzerland, Wales, Scotland, Poland, Albania, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Ottoman Empire, Russia, Ukraine, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Norway, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Romania, Bulgaria, Armenia, Greece, Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia.\n\n\nItalian population in Argentina arrived mainly from the northern Italian regions varying between Piedmont, Veneto and Lombardy, later from Campania and Calabria;[43]\nSpanish immigrants were mainly Galicians and Basques.[44][45]\nThousands of immigrants also came from France (notably Béarn and the Northern Basque Country), Germany, Switzerland, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Greece, Portugal, Finland, Russia and the United Kingdom.[46] The Welsh settlement in Patagonia, known as *Y Wladfa*, began in 1865; mainly along the coast of Chubut Province. In addition to the main colony in Chubut, a smaller colony was set up in Santa Fe and another group settled at Coronel Suárez, southern Buenos Aires Province.[47] Of the 50,000 Patagonians of Welsh descent, about 5,000 are Welsh speakers.[48] The community is centered on the cities of Gaiman, Trelew and Trevelin.[49]\n\n\n\n#### Recent immigrants[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Foreign born residents in Argentina by country of birth[50]\nAccording to the INDEC 1,531,940 of the Argentine resident population in 2001 were born outside Argentina, representing 4.22% of the total Argentine resident population.[51][52] In 2010, 1,805,957 of the Argentine resident population were born outside Argentina, representing 4.50% of the total Argentine resident population.[51][52][53][54]\n\n\nIllegal immigration has been a recent factor in Argentine demographics. Most illegal immigrants come from Bolivia and Paraguay, countries which border Argentina to the north. Smaller numbers arrive from Peru and Ecuador.\nThe Argentine government estimates that 750,000 inhabitants lack official documents and has launched a program called *Patria Grande* (\"Greater Homeland\")[55] to encourage illegal immigrants to regularize their status; so far over 670,000 applications have been processed under the program.[56]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank (2010) | Country of birth | Estimate 2023[57] | census 2010 | census 2001 | census 1990\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | ![](image) Paraguay | 897,366 | 550,713 | 325,046 | 254,115\n |\n| 2 | ![](image) Bolivia | 654,743 | 345,272 | 233,464 | 145,670\n |\n| 3 | ![](image) Chile | 209,934 | 191,147 | 212,429 | 247,987\n |\n| 4 | ![](image) Colombia | 110,974 | 177,000 | 50,250 | 15,939\n |\n| 4 | ![](image) Peru | 285,163 | 157,514 | 88,260 | 15,939\n |\n| 5 | ![](image) Italy | 88,671 | 147,499 | 216,718 | 356,923\n |\n| 6 | ![](image) Uruguay |  | 116,592 | 117,564 | 135,406\n |\n| 7 | ![](image) Spain | 70,674 | 94,030 | 134,417 | 244,212\n |\n| 8 | ![](image) Brazil | 94,480 | 41,330 | 34,712 | 33,966\n |\n| 9 | ![](image) China |  | 8,929 | 4,184 | 2,297\n |\n| 10 | ![](image) Germany |  | 8,416 | 10,362 | 15,451\n |\n| 11 | ![](image) South Korea |  | 7,321 | 8,290 | 8,371\n |\n| 12 | ![](image) France |  | 6,995 | 6,578 | 6,309\n |\n| 13 | ![](image) Japan |  | 4,036 | 4,753 | 5,674\n |\n| 14 | ![](image) Taiwan |  | 2,875 | 3,511 | 1,870\n |\n| 15 | ![](image) Syria |  | 1,337 | 2,350 | N/D\n |\n| 16 | ![](image) Lebanon |  | 933 | 1,619 | 3,171\n |\n| 17 | ![](image) Venezuela | 217,742 |  |  |  |\n|  | Other countries | 249,669 | 121,018 | 127,683 | 150,849\n |\n| **TOTAL** | **3,007,251** | **1,805,957** | **1,531,940** | **1,628,210** |\n\n\n## Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Argentina\n\nThe official language of Argentina is Spanish, and it is spoken by practically the entire population in several different accents. [*citation needed*] The most common variation of Spanish in Argentina is the **Rioplatense Spanish** (Spanish: *castellano rioplatense*), and it is so named because it evolved in the central areas around the Río de la Plata basin. Its distinctive feature is widespread voseo, the use of the pronoun *vos* instead of *tú* for the second person singular. Additionally, the Argentinian accent sounds identical to Portuguese in the words that begin with 'll' or 'yo', and all the words in Portuguese that begin with 'ch'. For example, the following sentence English: What is your name? Portuguese: como se chama? Spanish: Como se llama? - 'chama' & 'llama' are pronounced as though they were spelled \"Shama\"in both Argentinian Spanish and Portuguese. Moreover, the sound shift of all of the words in Spanish that begin with \"ll\" or 'y' but sound like 'sh' i.e., 'llorar' 'llama, 'llegar' & 'yo'. In Portuguese the words that begin with 'ch' always sound like 'sh'. There are many more words like these shown above. The mutual intelligibility between Spanish and Portuguese is already high, but the 'sh' sound increases the intelligibility between both languages even more.\n\n\n\n### Non-indigenous minority languages[edit]\n\n\nMany Argentines also speak other European languages (Italian, German, Portuguese, French, Welsh, Swedish and Croatian, as examples) due to the vast number of immigrants from Europe that came to Argentina.[7]\n\n\nEnglish language is a required subject in many schools, and there are also many private English-teaching academies and institutions. Young people have become accustomed to English through movies and the Internet, and knowledge of the language is also required in most jobs, so most middle-class children and teenagers now speak, read and/or understand it with various degrees of proficiency. According to an official cultural consumption survey conducted in 2006, 42.3% of Argentines claim to speak some English (though only 15.4% of those claimed to have a high level of English comprehension).[8]\n\n\nThere are sources of around one million Levantine Arabic speakers in Argentina,[58] as a result of immigration from the Middle East, mostly from Syria and Lebanon.\n\n\nStandard German is spoken by around 500,000[58][59] Argentines of German ancestry, though the number may be as high as 3,800,000 according to some sources.[60] German is the third or fourth most spoken language in Argentina.\n\n\nThere is a prosperous community of Argentine Welsh-speakers of approximately 25,000[61] in the province of Chubut, in the Patagonia region, who descend from 19th century immigrants.\n\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | **This section has multiple issues.** Please help **improve it** or discuss these issues on the **talk page**. *(Learn how and when to remove these template messages)*\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**.

The society, culture, and politics of Argentina are deeply imbued with Roman Catholicism.[63]\n\n\nEstimates for the number of Roman Catholics vary from 70% of the population,[64] to as much as 90%.[65] The CIA Factbook lists 92% of the country is Catholic, but only 20% are practicing regularly or weekly at a church service.[7] The Jewish population is about 300,000 (around 0.75% of the population), the community numbered about 400,000 after World War II, but the appeal of Israel and economic and cultural pressures at home led many to leave; recent instability in Israel has resulted in a modest reversal of the trend since 2003.[65][66] Muslim Argentines number about 500,000–600,000, or approximately 1.5% of the population; 93% of them are Sunni.[65] Buenos Aires is home to one of the largest mosques in Latin America. A study from 2010 found that approximately 11% of Argentines are non-religious, including those who believe in God, though not religion, agnostics (4%) and atheists (5%). Overall, 24% attended religious services regularly. Protestants were the only group in which a majority regularly attended services.[67]\n\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![Population distribution by province](image)\n\nPopulation distribution by province\n* ![Built in 1906 to welcome hundreds of newcomers daily, the Hotel de Inmigrantes is now a national museum.](image)\n\nBuilt in 1906 to welcome hundreds of newcomers daily, the Hotel de Inmigrantes is now a national museum.\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* National Institute of Statistics and Census of Argentina\n* Racism in Argentina\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** \"Censo Nacional de Población, Hogares y Viviendas 2022\" (PDF). *INDEC*.

The population density is 16.5 persons per square kilometer - well below the world average of 62 persons. Argentina's population growth rate in 2020 was estimated to be 0.35% annually, with a birth rate of 11.8 per 1,000 inhabitants and a mortality rate of 8.3 per 1,000 inhabitants.\n\n\nThe proportion of people under 15, at 23,5%, is slightly below the world average (25%), and the cohort of people 65 and older is relatively high, at 12.7%. The percentage of senior citizens in Argentina has long been second only to Uruguay in Latin America and well above the world average, which is currently 9.8%.\n\n\nThe median age is approximately 32 years and life expectancy at birth is of 78 years.[7] According to an official cultural consumption survey conducted in 2006, 42.3% of Argentines speak English (though only 15.4% of those claimed to have a high level of English comprehension), 9.3% speak Portuguese[8] and 5.9% speak Italian.[9]\n\n\n\n\n## Cities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of cities in Argentina by population\n\nArgentina is highly urbanized,[7] with the ten largest metropolitan areas accounting for half of the population, and fewer than one in ten living in rural areas. About 3 million people live in Buenos Aires proper, and including suburban Greater Buenos Aires the metropolitan area totals around 14 million - making it one of the 15 largest urban areas in the world.[10] The metropolitan areas of Córdoba and Rosario have around 1.3 million inhabitants each,[10] and six other cities (Mendoza, Tucumán, La Plata, Mar del Plata, Salta and Santa Fe)[10][11] have at least half a million people each.\n\n\nThe population is unequally distributed amongst the provinces, with 61% living in the Pampa region (21% of the total area), including 17.5 million people in Buenos Aires Province, 4 million in Córdoba Province, and over 3 million each in Santa Fe Province and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. Eight other provinces each have over one million people: Mendoza, Tucumán, Salta, Entre Ríos, Misiones, Corrientes, Chaco, and Santiago del Estero. Tucumán is the most densely populated (with 75 inhabitants/km2, the only Argentine province more densely populated than the world average), while the southern province of Santa Cruz has just 1.4 inhabitant/km2.[12]\n\n\nIn the mid-19th century, a large wave of immigration started to arrive to Argentina due to new constitutional policies that encouraged immigration, and issues in the countries the immigrants came from such as wars, poverty, hunger, famines, pursuit of a better life, among other reasons. The main immigration sources were from Europe, the countries from the Near and Middle East, Russia and Japan. In fact, the immigration torrent was so strong that Argentina eventually received the second-largest number of immigrants in the world, second only to the US and ahead of such immigrant receptor countries such as Canada, Brazil, Australia, etc.[13][14]\n\n\nMost of these European immigrants settled in the cities which offered jobs, education and other opportunities enabling them to enter the middle class. Many also settled in the growing small towns along the expanding railway system and since the 1930s many rural workers have moved to the big cities.[15]\n\n\nUrban areas reflect the influence of European immigration, and most of the larger ones feature boulevards and diagonal avenues inspired by the redevelopment of Paris. Argentine cities were originally built in a colonial Spanish grid style, centered on a plaza overlooked by a cathedral and important government buildings. Many still retain this general layout, known as a *damero*, meaning checkerboard, since it is based on a pattern of square blocks. The city of La Plata, designed at the end of the 19th century by Pedro Benoit, combines the checkerboard layout with added diagonal avenues at fixed intervals, and was the first in South America with electric street lighting.[16]\n\n\n\n### Provinces and districts[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Flag\n | Province/District\n | Capital\n | Population (2022)[1] | Rank | Density (/km2)[1] | Avg. growth from 2010

in Argentina during the past century. Several sources were combined to compile the table.[19][20][21]\n\n\nThe number of births in 2021 (529,794) was 32% below the record set in 2014, while the number of deaths (436,799) was the highest ever recorded[2] - though as the population of Argentina showed a five-fold increase during the past century, the birth rate in 2021 (11.6) was a record low while the death rate (9.5) rose to its highest since 1947 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[2]\n\n\nBirth rates were relatively stable from 1934 through 1980,[19] and after declining stabilized from 1995 to 2015 - before again declining sharply since then.[21]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Average population\n | Live births\n | Deaths\n | Natural change\n | Crude birth rate(per 1000) | Crude death rate(per 1000) | Natural change(per 1000) | Total

revision of the World Population Prospects[23][24] the total population was 45,276,780 in 2021 - double the number in 1966 (for a 1.27% average annual growth rate in that period). The population below the age of 15 in 2023 was 23.5%, 63.8% was between 15 and 64, while 12.7% was 65 or older.[3]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

Before the middle 19th century, the ethnic make up of Argentina was very similar to that of other countries of Latin America.[30][31][32][33] Between 1857 and 1950 Argentina was the country with the second biggest immigration wave in the world, at 6.6 million, second only to the United States in the numbers of immigrants received (27 million) and ahead of other areas of new settlement like Canada, Brazil and Australia.[34][35] However, mass European immigration did not have the same impact in the whole country. According to the 1914 national census, 30% of Argentina's population was foreign-born, including 50% of the people in the city of Buenos Aires, but foreigners were only 2% in the provinces of Catamarca and La Rioja (North West region).[31] Strikingly, at those times, the national population doubled every two decades. This belief is endured in the popular saying *\"los argentinos descienden de los barcos\"* (Argentines descend from the ships). Therefore, most Argentines are descended from the 19th- and 20th-century immigrants of the great European immigration wave to Argentina (1850–1955),[36] with a great majority of these immigrants coming from diverse European countries, particularly Italy and Spain.[13]\n\n\n\nCultural ethnic groups in the late 20th century in Argentina according to the UAEM[5]\n\n\n\nEuropean (85.0%)\nMestizo (11.4%)\nAsian and Arab (2.2%)\nAmerindian (1.0%)\nAfrican and Mulatto (0.4%)\n\nGenetic ancestry of the Argentine gene pool according to a study, using X-DIPs (matrilineal).[37]\n\n\n\nEuropean Contribution (52.9%)\nAmerindian Contribution (39.6%)\nAfrican Contribution (7.5%)\n\nGenetic ancestry of the mixed Argentines autosomal gene pool[37]\n\n\n\nEuropean Contribution (77.8%)\nAmerindian Contribution (17.9%)\nAfrican Contribution (4.2%)\n\nEthnic groupings in Argentina (2022 est.)[7]\n\n\n\nEuropean and Mestizo (97.2%)\nAmerindian (2.4%)\nAfrican (0.4%)\n\n### Indigenous peoples[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Argentine Amerindians\n\n![](image)Distribution of the Indigenous Peoples in Argentina and The Falkland Islands (British Overseas Territory)\nAccording to the data of INDEC's Complementary Survey of Indigenous Peoples (ECPI) 2004–2005, 600,000 officially recognized indigenous persons (about 1.4% of the total population) reside in Argentina. The most numerous of these communities are the Mapuches, who live mostly in the south, the Kollas and Wichís, from the northwest, and the Guaranis and Qom, who live mostly in the northeast.[38]\nIn the census of 2010, 955,032 people self recognized as indigenous or descendants of indigenous peoples, thus representing 2.4% of the national population. This is without prejudice that more than half of the population has at least one indigenous ancestor, although in most cases family memory lost that origin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Indigenous population of Argentina**\n| Ethnicgroup\n | Survey 2004–2005\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Number\n | %\n |\n| Aonikenk | 10,590 | 1.8\n |\n| Atacama | 3,044 | 0.5\n |\n| Avá-Guaraní | 21,807 | 3.6\n |\n| Aymara | 4,104 | 0.7\n |\n| Chané | 4,376 | 0.7\n |\n| Charrúa | 4,511 | 0.7\n |\n| Chorote | 2,613 | 0.4\n |\n| Chulupí | 553 | 0.1\n |\n| Comechingón | 10,863 | 1.8\n |\n| Diaguita/diaguita calchaquí | 31,753 | 5.3\n |\n| Guaraní | 22,059 | 3.7\n |\n| Het | 736 | 0.1\n |\n| Huarpe | 14,633 | 2.4\n |\n| Kolla | 70,505 | 11.7\n |\n| Lule | 854 | 0.1\n |\n| Mapuche | 113,680 | 18.8\n |\n| Mbyá | 8,223 | 1.4\n |\n| Mocoví | 15,837 | 2.6\n |\n| Omaguaca | 1,553 | 0.3\n |\n| Pilagá | 4,465 | 0.7\n |\n| Puelche | 1,585 | 0.3\n |\n| Qom | 69,452 | 11.5\n |\n| Quechua | 6,739 | 1.1\n |\n| Rankulche | 10,149 | 1.7\n |\n| Sanavirón | 563 | 0.1\n |\n| Selknam | 696 | 0.1\n |\n| Tapiete | 524 | 0.1\n |\n| Tonocoté | 4,779 | 0.8\n |\n| Wichí | 40,036 | 6.6\n |\n| Others | 3,864 | 0.6\n |\n| Not specified | 102,247 | 16.0\n |\n\n\n### Afro-Argentines[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Afro-Argentines\n\n![](image)Santiago Lovell, Argentine boxer and gold medalist at the 1932 Summer Olympics\nSince 2013, November 8 has been celebrated as the National Day of Afro-Argentines and African Culture. The date was chosen to commemorate the recorded date for the death of María Remedios del Valle, a *rabona* and guerrilla fighter, who served with the Army of the North in the war of Independence.[39][40]\n\n\nThe black population in Argentina declined since the middle 19th century from 15% of the total population in 1857 (Blacks and Mulatto people), to less than 0.5% at present (mainly mulattoes and immigrants from Cape Verde).\n\n\nAfro-Argentines were up to a third of the population during colonial times; most were slaves brought from Africa to work for the criollos. The 1813 Assembly abolished slavery and led to the Freedom of Wombs Law of 1813, which automatically freed slaves' children at birth. Many Afro-Argentines contributed to the independence of Argentina such as María Remedios del Valle who is known as \"La Madre de la Patria\" (mother of the fatherland in English) and Sgt. Juan Bautista Cabral. Also there is a debate, among the historians, as to whether or not Bernardino Rivadavia, the first president of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata (Present Argentina) had African ancestors.[41]\n\n\n\n### Immigration to Argentina[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Immigration to Argentina\n\n#### European settlement[edit]\n\n\nAs with other areas of new settlement such as Canada, Australia, the United States, Brazil, and New Zealand, Argentina is considered a country of immigrants.[42] When it is considered that Argentina was second only to the United States (27 million of immigrants) in the number of immigrants received, even ahead of such other areas of new settlement like Canada, Brazil and Australia;[34][35] and that the country was scarcely populated following its independence, the impact of the immigration to Argentina becomes evident.[34][35]\n\n\nIn the last national census, based on self-identification, 952,032 Argentines (2.4% of the population) declared to be Amerindians.[38] Most of the 6.2 million European immigrants arriving between 1850 and 1950, regardless of origin, settled in several regions of the country. Due to this large-scale European immigration, Argentina's population more than doubled.\n\n\n\n![](image)Immigrant population in Argentina (1869–1991)\nThe majority of these European immigrants came from Spain and Italy.\nThousands of immigrants also came from France, Germany, England, Portugal, Brazil, Switzerland, Wales, Scotland, Poland, Albania, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Ottoman Empire, Russia, Ukraine, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Norway, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Romania, Bulgaria, Armenia, Greece, Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia.\n\n\nItalian population in Argentina arrived mainly from the northern Italian regions varying between Piedmont, Veneto and Lombardy, later from Campania and Calabria;[43]\nSpanish immigrants were mainly Galicians and Basques.[44][45]\nThousands of immigrants also came from France (notably Béarn and the Northern Basque Country), Germany, Switzerland, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Greece, Portugal, Finland, Russia and the United Kingdom.[46] The Welsh settlement in Patagonia, known as *Y Wladfa*, began in 1865; mainly along the coast of Chubut Province. In addition to the main colony in Chubut, a smaller colony was set up in Santa Fe and another group settled at Coronel Suárez, southern Buenos Aires Province.[47] Of the 50,000 Patagonians of Welsh descent, about 5,000 are Welsh speakers.[48] The community is centered on the cities of Gaiman, Trelew and Trevelin.[49]\n\n\n\n#### Recent immigrants[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Foreign born residents in Argentina by country of birth[50]\nAccording to the INDEC 1,531,940 of the Argentine resident population in 2001 were born outside Argentina, representing 4.22% of the total Argentine resident population.[51][52] In 2010, 1,805,957 of the Argentine resident population were born outside Argentina, representing 4.50% of the total Argentine resident population.[51][52][53][54]\n\n\nIllegal immigration has been a recent factor in Argentine demographics. Most illegal immigrants come from Bolivia and Paraguay, countries which border Argentina to the north. Smaller numbers arrive from Peru and Ecuador.\nThe Argentine government estimates that 750,000 inhabitants lack official documents and has launched a program called *Patria Grande* (\"Greater Homeland\")[55] to encourage illegal immigrants to regularize their status; so far over 670,000 applications have been processed under the program.[56]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank (2010) | Country of birth | Estimate 2023[57] | census 2010 | census 2001 | census 1990\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | ![](image) Paraguay | 897,366 | 550,713 | 325,046 | 254,115\n |\n| 2 | ![](image) Bolivia | 654,743 | 345,272 | 233,464 | 145,670\n |\n| 3 | ![](image) Chile | 209,934 | 191,147 | 212,429 | 247,987\n |\n| 4 | ![](image) Colombia | 110,974 | 177,000 | 50,250 | 15,939\n |\n| 4 | ![](image) Peru | 285,163 | 157,514 | 88,260 | 15,939\n |\n| 5 | ![](image) Italy | 88,671 | 147,499 | 216,718 | 356,923\n |\n| 6 | ![](image) Uruguay |  | 116,592 | 117,564 | 135,406\n |\n| 7 | ![](image) Spain | 70,674 | 94,030 | 134,417 | 244,212\n |\n| 8 | ![](image) Brazil | 94,480 | 41,330 | 34,712 | 33,966\n |\n| 9 | ![](image) China |  | 8,929 | 4,184 | 2,297\n |\n| 10 | ![](image) Germany |  | 8,416 | 10,362 | 15,451\n |\n| 11 | ![](image) South Korea |  | 7,321 | 8,290 | 8,371\n |\n| 12 | ![](image) France |  | 6,995 | 6,578 | 6,309\n |\n| 13 | ![](image) Japan |  | 4,036 | 4,753 | 5,674\n |\n| 14 | ![](image) Taiwan |  | 2,875 | 3,511 | 1,870\n |\n| 15 | ![](image) Syria |  | 1,337 | 2,350 | N/D\n |\n| 16 | ![](image) Lebanon |  | 933 | 1,619 | 3,171\n |\n| 17 | ![](image) Venezuela | 217,742 |  |  |  |\n|  | Other countries | 249,669 | 121,018 | 127,683 | 150,849\n |\n| **TOTAL** | **3,007,251** | **1,805,957** | **1,531,940** | **1,628,210** |\n\n\n## Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Argentina\n\nThe official language of Argentina is Spanish, and it is spoken by practically the entire population in several different accents. [*citation needed*] The most common variation of Spanish in Argentina is the **Rioplatense Spanish** (Spanish: *castellano rioplatense*), and it is so named because it evolved in the central areas around the Río de la Plata basin. Its distinctive feature is widespread voseo, the use of the pronoun *vos* instead of *tú* for the second person singular. Additionally, the Argentinian accent sounds identical to Portuguese in the words that begin with 'll' or 'yo', and all the words in Portuguese that begin with 'ch'. For example, the following sentence English: What is your name? Portuguese: como se chama? Spanish: Como se llama? - 'chama' & 'llama' are pronounced as though they were spelled \"Shama\"in both Argentinian Spanish and Portuguese. Moreover, the sound shift of all of the words in Spanish that begin with \"ll\" or 'y' but sound like 'sh' i.e., 'llorar' 'llama, 'llegar' & 'yo'. In Portuguese the words that begin with 'ch' always sound like 'sh'. There are many more words like these shown above. The mutual intelligibility between Spanish and Portuguese is already high, but the 'sh' sound increases the intelligibility between both languages even more.\n\n\n\n### Non-indigenous minority languages[edit]\n\n\nMany Argentines also speak other European languages (Italian, German, Portuguese, French, Welsh, Swedish and Croatian, as examples) due to the vast number of immigrants from Europe that came to Argentina.[7]\n\n\nEnglish language is a required subject in many schools, and there are also many private English-teaching academies and institutions. Young people have become accustomed to English through movies and the Internet, and knowledge of the language is also required in most jobs, so most middle-class children and teenagers now speak, read and/or understand it with various degrees of proficiency. According to an official cultural consumption survey conducted in 2006, 42.3% of Argentines claim to speak some English (though only 15.4% of those claimed to have a high level of English comprehension).[8]\n\n\nThere are sources of around one million Levantine Arabic speakers in Argentina,[58] as a result of immigration from the Middle East, mostly from Syria and Lebanon.\n\n\nStandard German is spoken by around 500,000[58][59] Argentines of German ancestry, though the number may be as high as 3,800,000 according to some sources.[60] German is the third or fourth most spoken language in Argentina.\n\n\nThere is a prosperous community of Argentine Welsh-speakers of approximately 25,000[61] in the province of Chubut, in the Patagonia region, who descend from 19th century immigrants.\n\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | **This section has multiple issues.** Please help **improve it** or discuss these issues on the **talk page**. *(Learn how and when to remove these template messages)*\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**.

The society, culture, and politics of Argentina are deeply imbued with Roman Catholicism.[63]\n\n\nEstimates for the number of Roman Catholics vary from 70% of the population,[64] to as much as 90%.[65] The CIA Factbook lists 92% of the country is Catholic, but only 20% are practicing regularly or weekly at a church service.[7] The Jewish population is about 300,000 (around 0.75% of the population), the community numbered about 400,000 after World War II, but the appeal of Israel and economic and cultural pressures at home led many to leave; recent instability in Israel has resulted in a modest reversal of the trend since 2003.[65][66] Muslim Argentines number about 500,000–600,000, or approximately 1.5% of the population; 93% of them are Sunni.[65] Buenos Aires is home to one of the largest mosques in Latin America. A study from 2010 found that approximately 11% of Argentines are non-religious, including those who believe in God, though not religion, agnostics (4%) and atheists (5%). Overall, 24% attended religious services regularly. Protestants were the only group in which a majority regularly attended services.[67]\n\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![Population distribution by province](image)\n\nPopulation distribution by province\n* ![Built in 1906 to welcome hundreds of newcomers daily, the Hotel de Inmigrantes is now a national museum.](image)\n\nBuilt in 1906 to welcome hundreds of newcomers daily, the Hotel de Inmigrantes is now a national museum.\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* National Institute of Statistics and Census of Argentina\n* Racism in Argentina\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** \"Censo Nacional de Población, Hogares y Viviendas 2022\" (PDF). *INDEC*.
