They finished the season with a record of 90–62, seven games ahead of the Boston Braves. The Phillies went up against the Boston Red Sox in the World Series, opening the series at home with a victory. The Phillies struggled against a strong Red Sox pitching lineup and surrendered the next four games, losing the series four games to one. \n\n\nThe team continued to dominate the National League in 1916 but fell short of capturing a second consecutive pennant.

Since 2004, the team's home stadium has been Citizens Bank Park, located in the South Philadelphia Sports Complex.[7][8][9][10]\n\n\nThe Phillies have won two World Series championships (against the Kansas City Royals in 1980 and the Tampa Bay Rays in 2008), eight National League pennants (the first of which came in 1915), and made 15 playoff appearances. As of November 6, 2022, the team has played 21,209 games, winning 10,022 games and losing 11,187.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOf the 18 players who have hit four home runs in one game, three were Phillies at the time (more than any other team).[140] Ed Delahanty was the first, hitting his four in Chicago's West Side Park on July 13, 1896. Chuck Klein repeated the feat nearly 40 years later to the day, on July 10, 1936, at Pittsburgh's Forbes Field. Forty years later, on April 17, 1976, Mike Schmidt became the third, with his hits in Chicago at Wrigley Field.\n\n\n\n### Hall of Famers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of members of the Baseball Hall of Fame\n\n*See footnote*[141]\n\n\n| Philadelphia Phillies Hall of Famers\n |\n| --- |\n| Affiliation according to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1884, Harry Wright, the former manager of baseball's first openly professional team, the Cincinnati Red Stockings, was recruited as a manager in hopes of reversing the team's fortunes.[16]\n\n\nIn 1887, the team began to play at the newly constructed Philadelphia Base Ball Grounds, later renamed National League Park.

They were the first American sports franchise to amass over 10,000 losses; the team holds the world record for most ever losses by a single team in all of professional sports.[12] Yet, also due in part to their longevity, the Phillies are one of only nine teams to have won over 10,000 games in their history. Hall of Fame third baseman Mike Schmidt is widely considered the franchise's greatest player of all time.[13] Over the team's history since 1883, 33 Phillies players have been awarded entry into the Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\n\nThe Philadelphia Phillies' Triple-A affiliate is the Lehigh Valley IronPigs, who play at Coca-Cola Park in Allentown.

This name is one of the longest continually used nicknames in professional sports by a team in the same city.[17]\n\n\nThe franchise's standout players in the era were Billy Hamilton, Sam Thompson, and Ed Delahanty, who in 1896 set the major-league record (since tied by several others) with four home runs in a single game. Due to growing disagreements about the direction of the team, Reach sold his interest to Rogers in 1899.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe team powered their way to a 97–65 record and an NL East division title, all thanks to a big April in which the Phillies went 17–5. The Phillies' major contributors on offense were Dykstra, Kruk, Kevin Stocker (a rookie who led the team in batting average, hitting .324), and Jim Eisenreich, all of whom hit over .300 for the season. Their pitching staff was led by 16-game winners Curt Schilling and Tommy Greene. Each member of the rotation posted at least 10 wins, while the bullpen was led by elder statesman Larry Andersen and closer Mitch \"Wild Thing\" Williams, who notched 43 saves and a 3.34 ERA.\n\n\nThey beat the Atlanta Braves in the 1993 National League Championship Series, four games to two, to earn the fifth NL pennant in franchise history, only to be defeated by the defending World Series champion Toronto Blue Jays in the 1993 World Series.[35] Toronto's Joe Carter hit a walk-off home run in Game 6 to clinch another Phillies' loss.[36]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNational Football League (1902)\n |\n| --- |\n| Teams | * Philadelphia Athletics\n* Philadelphia Phillies\n* Pittsburgh Stars\n |\n| Team seasons | * 1902 Philadelphia Athletics season\n* 1902 Philadelphia Phillies season\n* 1902 Pittsburgh Stars season\n |\n| Stadia | * National League Park\n* Columbia Park\n* Pittsburgh Coliseum\n |\n| Owners | * Barney Dreyfuss\n* William Chase Temple\n* John Rogers\n* Ben Shibe\n |\n| Managers | * Dave Berry\n* Connie Mack\n* Bill Shettsline\n |\n| Coaches | * Willis Richardson\n* Ben Roller\n* Blondy Wallace\n |\n| Sponsors | * Philadelphia Athletics\n* Philadelphia Phillies\n* Pittsburgh Pirates\n |\n| Related topics | * World Series of Football (1902–1903)\n |\n |\n\nPortals:* ![icon](image) Baseball\n* ![](image) Philadelphia\n* ![flag](image) Pennsylvania\n\n| Authority control databases ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n |\n| --- |\n| International | * FAST\n |\n| National | * United States\n* Japan\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n28. **^** \"Phillies Timeline: 1960s\". *History Highlights*.

They were awarded a spot in the league to replace the Worcester baseball team, a franchise that had folded in 1882. The new team was nicknamed the \"Phillies\" from the start, and immediately compiled a .173 winning percentage, which stands as the worst in franchise history. Although many sources (including the Phillies themselves) claim that Reach and Rogers bought the Brown Stockings and moved them to Philadelphia, all available evidence suggests this is not the case. Significantly, no players from Worcester[14] ended up with the 1883 Quakers.[15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe franchise was founded in Philadelphia in 1883, replacing the team from Worcester, Massachusetts, in the National League. The team has played at several stadiums in the city, beginning with Recreation Park (1883–1886) and continuing at Baker Bowl (1887–1938); Shibe Park (which was renamed Connie Mack Stadium in 1953 in honor of the longtime Philadelphia Athletics manager Connie Mack) (1938–1970); Veterans Stadium (1971–2003), and now Citizens Bank Park (2004–present).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith the birth of the more lucrative American League (AL) in 1901, the Phillies saw many of their better players defect to the upstart, including a number of players who ended up playing for their crosstown rivals, the Athletics, owned by former Phillies minority owner Benjamin Shibe. While their former teammates would thrive (the AL's first five batting champions were former Phillies), the remaining squad fared dismally, finishing 46 games out of first place in 1902—the first of three straight years finishing either seventh or eighth. \n\n\nTo add tragedy to folly, a balcony collapsed during a game at the Baker Bowl in 1903, killing 12 and injuring hundreds. Rogers was forced to sell the Phillies to avoid being ruined by an avalanche of lawsuits.[16] In 1904, the team finished with a record of 52–100, making them the first team in franchise history to have lost 100 games.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![Street view photograph of the entrance to Shibe Park/Connie Mack Stadium, home of the Phillies from 1938 to 1970](image)Shibe Park, renamed Connie Mack Stadium in 1953, was the Phillies' home field from 1938 to 1970.\nThe effect of the Alexander trade was immediate. In 1918, only three years after winning the pennant, the Phillies finished sixth, 13 games under .500. It was the start of one of the longest streaks of futility in baseball history. From 1918 to 1948, the Phillies had only one winning record, which came in 1932. The team finished higher than sixth only twice, and were never a serious factor past June. During this stretch, they finished eighth (last place) a total of 17 times and seventh seven times, with 12 seasons in which they lost at least 100 games. This saddled the franchise with a reputation for failure that dogged it for many years. The team's primary stars during the 1920s and 1930s were outfielders Cy Williams, Lefty O'Doul, and Chuck Klein, who won the Triple Crown in 1933.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Philadelphia team added three minor league clubs before the start of the 1946 season and named them all Blue Jays: the Class C Salina Blue Jays, Class C Schenectady Blue Jays and Class D Green Bay Blue Jays. \n\n\nHowever, the new Blue Jays moniker was ultimately unpopular, and although the team in the 2000s claimed that it was quietly dropped by 1949,[21] news reports at the time indicate that the nickname, which \"never caught on anyway\", was not officially dropped by the team until January 1950.[23]\n\n\nCoincidentally, the Phillies would play a team called the Blue Jays (who wasn't based in Philadelphia but in Toronto) in the 1993 World Series with the defending world champion Blue Jays winning in six games.\n\n\n(The Blue Jays moniker would be used by Toronto's MLB club when it started play in 1977.[21])\n\n\n\n### Fightin’ Phils (1949–1970)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 1950 World Series, Jim Bunning's perfect game, and Whiz Kids (baseball)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThings started coming together for the Phillies in 1949, when they rocketed up the standings to third place with an 81–73 record. Although the season had essentially been a two-team race between Brooklyn and St. Louis, it was still the Phillies' first appearance in the first division in 31 years.

In a memorable NLCS, with four of the five games needing extra innings, they fell behind 2–1 but battled back to squeeze past the Astros on a 10th-inning game-winning hit by center fielder Garry Maddox, and the city celebrated its first NL pennant in 30 years.[30] The entire series saw only one home run hit, a game-winning two-run home run by Phillies slugger Greg Luzinski in the Phillies' opening 3–1 win in Game 1 at Philadelphia.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCharlie Manuel took over the club's reins from Bowa after the 2004 season, and general manager Ed Wade was replaced by Pat Gillick in November 2005.

They won this series in four games to capture their fourth NL pennant; however, they lost to the Baltimore Orioles in the World Series in five games. John Denny was named the 1983 NL Cy Young Award winner. Because of the numerous veterans on the 1983 team, *Philadelphia Daily News* sportswriter Stan Hochman gave them the nickname, the \"Wheeze Kids\".[33]\n\n\nIn 1984, the team finished fourth in the NL East with a record of 81–81.

Bob Carpenter Jr. retired in 1972 and passed the team ownership to his son Ruly. \n\n\nThe Phillies achieved some success in the mid-1970s. With players such as Carlton, third baseman Mike Schmidt, shortstop Larry Bowa, catcher Bob Boone, and outfielder Greg Luzinski, the Phillies won three straight division titles (1976–78).

In the final months of the season, a tailspin (triggered by the loss of starting pitcher Curt Simmons to National Guard service) caused the team to lose the next eight of ten games. On the last day of the season, the Phillies hung on to a one-game lead when Dick Sisler’s dramatic tenth inning home run against the Brooklyn Dodgers clinched the Phillies' first pennant in 35 years. In the World Series, exhausted from their late-season plunge and victims of poor luck, the Phillies were swept by the New York Yankees in four straight games.

The main team colors are red and white, with blue serving as a prominent accent. The team name is written in red with a blue star serving as the dot over the \"i\"s, and blue piping is often found in Phillies' branded apparel and materials. The team's home uniform is white with red pinstripes, lettering and numbering. The road uniform is traditional grey with red lettering/numbering. Both bear a script-lettered \"Phillies\" logo, with the aforementioned star dotting the \"i\"s across the chest, and the player name and number on the back. The uniform's front script has undergone minor changes over the years.[90] Hats are red with a single stylized \"P\".[91] The uniforms and logo are very similar to those used during the \"Whiz Kids\" era from 1950 to 1969.\n\n\nThe Phillies and the St. Louis Cardinals are the only MLB teams to use chain stitching in their chest emblems.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe team's competitive futility was highlighted by a record that still stands: in 1961, the Phillies lost 23 games in a row, the worst losing streak in the majors since 1900. Things started to turn around for the team in 1962, when the team finished above .500 for the first time in five years. Gene Mauch was named National League Manager of the Year that season and won it again in 1964. The team improved in 1963, when the team finished the season with an 87–75 record. There was confidence that the team would soon become contenders for a return to the World Series. Though Ashburn and Roberts were gone, the 1964 Phillies still had younger pitchers Art Mahaffey, Chris Short, and rookie Ray Culp; veterans Jim Bunning and screwballer Jack Baldschun; and fan favorites Cookie Rojas, Johnny Callison, and NL Rookie of the Year Dick Allen. The team was 90–60 on September 20, good enough for a lead of 6.5 games in the pennant race with 12 games to play. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n101. **^** Young, Dennis (July 27, 2019). \"The Phillies wore their horrendous Saturday Night Special uniforms and got the same crappy result as 40 years ago\". *nydailynews.com*.

Even today, Phillies' home games can contain many fans sporting caps, shirts, and/or jackets emblazoned with the iconic \"P\" and burgundy color scheme. The current team has worn the burgundy and powder blue throwbacks whenever their opponents are wearing throwback uniforms from that era. Additionally, this uniform also marked the first appearance of \"racing stripes\" on a baseball uniform (striping going down the jersey shoulders, the side of the pants and up to the sides of the jersey up to the armpit), which would be seen on several other MLB teams for the next quarter-century.\n\n\n\n### Controversial uniform changes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPhiladelphia Revolution\nUSPHL\nPittsburgh Vengeance\nWilkes-Barre/Scranton Knights\n |\n| Inline hockey | PIHA\nHarrisburg Lunatics\nPennsylvania Typhoon\nAIHL\nDelco Demons\nPhiladelphia Liberty\nPittsburgh Bandits\nPottstown Team Blue\nScottdale Inferno\n |\n| Lacrosse | NLL\nPhiladelphia Wings\nPLL\nPhiladelphia Waterdogs\nUWLX\nPhiladelphia Force\nWPLL\nPhiladelphia Fire\n |\n| Roller derby | WFTDA\nBlack Rose Rollers\nBrandywine Roller Derby\nDutchland Derby Rollers\nHarrisburg Area Roller Derby\nLehigh Valley Roller Derby\nPhilly Roller Derby\nSteel City Roller Derby\nPenn Jersey Roller Derby\nMRDA\nPenn Jersey Roller Derby\nRDCL\nPenn Jersey Roller Derby\n |\n| Rugby league | USARL\nBucks County Sharks\nPhiladelphia Fight\nPittsburgh Sledgehammers\n |\n| Soccer | MLS\nPhiladelphia Union\nMLS Next Pro\nPhiladelphia Union II\nUSLC\nPittsburgh Riverhounds SC\nUSL2\nLehigh Valley United\nPhiladelphia Lone Star FC\nReading United AC\nWest Chester United SC\nNPSL\nElectric City Shock SC\nErie Commodores FC\nHershey FC\nPittsburgh Hotspurs\nTorch FC\nWPSL\nFC Bucks\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n231. **^** \"Philadelphia Phillies Lead MLB in Attendance For First Time Ever\".

They won the NLDS three games to one against the Milwaukee Brewers, and they defeated the Dodgers in Los Angeles as well, 4–1. As the National League champions, the Phillies advanced to the 2008 World Series to play the Tampa Bay Rays, winning the series 4 games to 1. Game 5 began on Monday, October 27, and was suspended after the top of the 6th inning, with the scored tied 2-2. The game resumed Wednesday, October 29, with the Phillies winning the game 4-3 and capturing their second world series in franchise history. Prior to this, there had never been a rain-shortened game in World Series history, and this was the first suspension. Cole Hamels won the Most Valuable Player Award for both the NLCS and the World Series. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThey lost to the Atlanta Braves 15–7.[101]\n\n\nAnother uniform controversy arose in 1994, when the Phillies introduced all-blue caps on Opening Day that were to be worn for home day games only.[102] The caps were unpopular with the players, who considered them bad luck after two losses and wanted them discontinued. Management wanted to keep using the caps as planned, as they sold well to fans. A compromise was reached: the players agreed to wear them for weekday games while returning to the customary red caps for Sunday afternoon games.[103] In all, the Phillies wore the \"unlucky\" blue caps for seven games in 1994, losing six (the lone victory a 5–2 triumph over the Florida Marlins on June 29).[104] A slightly different blue cap (with a red bill) was introduced in 2008 as part of the alternate home uniform for day games, a throwback to the late 1940s.\n\n\n\n## Rivalries[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n#### City Series: Philadelphia Athletics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: City Series (Philadelphia)\n\nThe City Series was the name of a series of baseball games played between the Philadelphia Athletics of the American League and the Phillies that ran from 1903 through 1955. After the A's move to Kansas City, Missouri in 1955, the City Series rivalry came to an end. The teams have since faced each other in Interleague play (since its introduction in 1997) but the rivalry has effectively died in the intervening years since the A's left Philadelphia. In 2014, when the A's faced the Phillies in inter-league play at Oakland Coliseum, the Athletics did not bother to mark the historical connection, going so far as to have a Connie Mack promotion the day before the series while the Texas Rangers were in Oakland.[120]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n128. **^** \"1993 Philadelphia Phillies\". *Baseball-Reference.com*.

A dark burgundy was adopted as the main team color, with a classic pinstripe style for home uniforms. Blue was almost entirely dropped as part of the team's official color scheme, except in one area; a pale blue (as opposed to traditional grey) was used as the base-color for away game uniforms from 1972 to 1988. Yet the most important aspect of the 1970 uniform change was the adoption of one of the more distinctive logos in sports; a Phillies \"P\" that, thanks to its unique shape and \"baseball stitched\" center swirl, remained instantly recognizable and admired, long after its regular use had ended. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Phillies would take Game 3 by a score of 7-0, which was a result of the team hitting five home runs in the first five innings of the game, the first time this had occurred in World Series history.[86] All five home runs were given up by Astros pitcher Lance McCullers Jr., which became a record for most home runs surrendered by a pitcher in a World Series game.[87] In Game 4, the Astros answered back by winning the game 5-0 and throwing a combined no-hitter, the first combined no-hitter in postseason history, and just the second no-hitter of any type in a World Series after Don Larsen's perfect game in 1956.[88] The Astros won the next two games, winning the series four games to two. The Phillies' game six loss, coming shortly after the Philadelphia Union fell in the championship game of the MLS Cup, made Philadelphia the first American city to lose two major professional sports championship title games in the same day. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n3. **^** Ritchie, Matthew (October 6, 2023). \"Alvarado masquerades as Phils' 'jeweler' with hand-beaded necklaces\". *MLB.com*.

He immediately started signing young players and invested even more money in the farm system, and the Phillies quickly developed a solid core of young players that included future Hall of Famers Richie Ashburn and Robin Roberts. This coincided with the final collapse of the A's. Philadelphia had been an \"A's town\" for most of the first half of the 20th century. Even though the A's had fielded teams as bad or worse than the Phillies for most years since the 1930s, the A's continued to trounce the Phillies at the gate. However, a series of poor baseball and business decisions on the A's part allowed the Phillies to win the hearts of Philadelphia's long-suffering fans.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n54. **^** Zolecki, Todd (September 27, 2010). \"Phour!

As a result, the fan base and attendance at home games increased. Eventually, Cox revealed that he had been betting on the Phillies, and he was banned from baseball by baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis on Nov. 23, 1943. The new owner, Bob Carpenter Sr., scion of the Delaware-based duPont family, bought the team with his son for an estimated $400,000 that same day – November 23, 1943.[19] The Carpenters tried to polish the team's image and way of doing business. Carpenter Sr. named his son, Bob Carpenter, Jr., team president. They wanted to shed the image of failure by changing the team's nickname.\n\n\n\n#### Philadelphia Blue Jays[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **WPct** | Winning percentage: number of wins divided by number of games managed\n |\n| **PA** | Playoff appearances: number of years this manager has led the franchise to the playoffs |\n| **PW** | Playoff wins: number of wins this manager has accrued in the playoffs\n |\n| **PL** | Playoff losses: number of losses this manager has accrued in the playoffs\n |\n| **WS** | World Series: number of World Series victories achieved by the manager\n |\n| † *or* ‡ | Elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame (‡ denotes induction as manager)[126] |\n| § | Member of the Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Phillies' rivalry with the Washington Nationals extends back during their original tenure as the Montreal Expos. The two teams repeatedly battled for control of the division in the early 1980s and mid 1990s. Following the franchise's relocation to Washington DC in 2005; the rivalry increased in geographic tension due to Washington's proximity to Philadelphia. The rivalry quickly spiked in intensity during the 2010s after Nationals team management introduced a campaign to block Phillies fans from overtaking home games. In 2019; star-outfielder Bryce Harper further fueled tensions after signing a 13-year $330 million contract with the Phillies as a free agent.[117][118] The Nationals later managed to win the 2019 World Series during the first year of Harper's absence.[119] The Phillies currently lead the series 482-445, but the Nationals lead the postseason series; when the Expos managed a 3-2 victory over the Phillies during the 1981 NLDS.\n\n\n\n### Historical rivalries[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Phillies' win–loss record never went below .500 during this time; and the team won the NL East five years in a row from 2007 to 2011.[62]\n\n\n\n### End of an era (2013–2018)[edit]\n\n\nDuring the 2013 season, the team struggled again and was unable to consistently play well for the majority of the season. On August 16, 2013, with the team's record at 53–68, the Phillies fired manager Charlie Manuel, who had managed the team since 2005,[63] and promoted third-base coach Ryne Sandberg to interim manager. Manuel had spent over nine years as manager, leading Philadelphia to its first World Series victory in nearly 30 years and amassing an overall record of 780–636 to become the manager with the most wins in the franchise's history. The 2013 Phillies ended up with a record of 73–89, their first losing season since 2002. In the off-season, pitcher Roy Halladay retired from baseball.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Dell Technologies Suite Level\". *Phillies.com*. MLB Advanced Media.

Hall of Fame third baseman Mike Schmidt is widely considered the franchise's greatest player of all time.[13] Over the team's history since 1883, 33 Phillies players have been awarded entry into the Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\n\nThe Philadelphia Phillies' Triple-A affiliate is the Lehigh Valley IronPigs, who play at Coca-Cola Park in Allentown.

This name is one of the longest continually used nicknames in professional sports by a team in the same city.[17]\n\n\nThe franchise's standout players in the era were Billy Hamilton, Sam Thompson, and Ed Delahanty, who in 1896 set the major-league record (since tied by several others) with four home runs in a single game. Due to growing disagreements about the direction of the team, Reach sold his interest to Rogers in 1899.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe team powered their way to a 97–65 record and an NL East division title, all thanks to a big April in which the Phillies went 17–5. The Phillies' major contributors on offense were Dykstra, Kruk, Kevin Stocker (a rookie who led the team in batting average, hitting .324), and Jim Eisenreich, all of whom hit over .300 for the season. Their pitching staff was led by 16-game winners Curt Schilling and Tommy Greene. Each member of the rotation posted at least 10 wins, while the bullpen was led by elder statesman Larry Andersen and closer Mitch \"Wild Thing\" Williams, who notched 43 saves and a 3.34 ERA.\n\n\nThey beat the Atlanta Braves in the 1993 National League Championship Series, four games to two, to earn the fifth NL pennant in franchise history, only to be defeated by the defending World Series champion Toronto Blue Jays in the 1993 World Series.[35] Toronto's Joe Carter hit a walk-off home run in Game 6 to clinch another Phillies' loss.[36]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNational Football League (1902)\n |\n| --- |\n| Teams | * Philadelphia Athletics\n* Philadelphia Phillies\n* Pittsburgh Stars\n |\n| Team seasons | * 1902 Philadelphia Athletics season\n* 1902 Philadelphia Phillies season\n* 1902 Pittsburgh Stars season\n |\n| Stadia | * National League Park\n* Columbia Park\n* Pittsburgh Coliseum\n |\n| Owners | * Barney Dreyfuss\n* William Chase Temple\n* John Rogers\n* Ben Shibe\n |\n| Managers | * Dave Berry\n* Connie Mack\n* Bill Shettsline\n |\n| Coaches | * Willis Richardson\n* Ben Roller\n* Blondy Wallace\n |\n| Sponsors | * Philadelphia Athletics\n* Philadelphia Phillies\n* Pittsburgh Pirates\n |\n| Related topics | * World Series of Football (1902–1903)\n |\n |\n\nPortals:* ![icon](image) Baseball\n* ![](image) Philadelphia\n* ![flag](image) Pennsylvania\n\n| Authority control databases ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n |\n| --- |\n| International | * FAST\n |\n| National | * United States\n* Japan\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n28. **^** \"Phillies Timeline: 1960s\". *History Highlights*.

They were awarded a spot in the league to replace the Worcester baseball team, a franchise that had folded in 1882. The new team was nicknamed the \"Phillies\" from the start, and immediately compiled a .173 winning percentage, which stands as the worst in franchise history. Although many sources (including the Phillies themselves) claim that Reach and Rogers bought the Brown Stockings and moved them to Philadelphia, all available evidence suggests this is not the case. Significantly, no players from Worcester[14] ended up with the 1883 Quakers.[15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe franchise was founded in Philadelphia in 1883, replacing the team from Worcester, Massachusetts, in the National League. The team has played at several stadiums in the city, beginning with Recreation Park (1883–1886) and continuing at Baker Bowl (1887–1938); Shibe Park (which was renamed Connie Mack Stadium in 1953 in honor of the longtime Philadelphia Athletics manager Connie Mack) (1938–1970); Veterans Stadium (1971–2003), and now Citizens Bank Park (2004–present).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith the birth of the more lucrative American League (AL) in 1901, the Phillies saw many of their better players defect to the upstart, including a number of players who ended up playing for their crosstown rivals, the Athletics, owned by former Phillies minority owner Benjamin Shibe. While their former teammates would thrive (the AL's first five batting champions were former Phillies), the remaining squad fared dismally, finishing 46 games out of first place in 1902—the first of three straight years finishing either seventh or eighth. \n\n\nTo add tragedy to folly, a balcony collapsed during a game at the Baker Bowl in 1903, killing 12 and injuring hundreds. Rogers was forced to sell the Phillies to avoid being ruined by an avalanche of lawsuits.[16] In 1904, the team finished with a record of 52–100, making them the first team in franchise history to have lost 100 games.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![Street view photograph of the entrance to Shibe Park/Connie Mack Stadium, home of the Phillies from 1938 to 1970](image)Shibe Park, renamed Connie Mack Stadium in 1953, was the Phillies' home field from 1938 to 1970.\nThe effect of the Alexander trade was immediate. In 1918, only three years after winning the pennant, the Phillies finished sixth, 13 games under .500. It was the start of one of the longest streaks of futility in baseball history. From 1918 to 1948, the Phillies had only one winning record, which came in 1932. The team finished higher than sixth only twice, and were never a serious factor past June. During this stretch, they finished eighth (last place) a total of 17 times and seventh seven times, with 12 seasons in which they lost at least 100 games. This saddled the franchise with a reputation for failure that dogged it for many years. The team's primary stars during the 1920s and 1930s were outfielders Cy Williams, Lefty O'Doul, and Chuck Klein, who won the Triple Crown in 1933.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Philadelphia team added three minor league clubs before the start of the 1946 season and named them all Blue Jays: the Class C Salina Blue Jays, Class C Schenectady Blue Jays and Class D Green Bay Blue Jays. \n\n\nHowever, the new Blue Jays moniker was ultimately unpopular, and although the team in the 2000s claimed that it was quietly dropped by 1949,[21] news reports at the time indicate that the nickname, which \"never caught on anyway\", was not officially dropped by the team until January 1950.[23]\n\n\nCoincidentally, the Phillies would play a team called the Blue Jays (who wasn't based in Philadelphia but in Toronto) in the 1993 World Series with the defending world champion Blue Jays winning in six games.\n\n\n(The Blue Jays moniker would be used by Toronto's MLB club when it started play in 1977.[21])\n\n\n\n### Fightin’ Phils (1949–1970)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 1950 World Series, Jim Bunning's perfect game, and Whiz Kids (baseball)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThings started coming together for the Phillies in 1949, when they rocketed up the standings to third place with an 81–73 record. Although the season had essentially been a two-team race between Brooklyn and St. Louis, it was still the Phillies' first appearance in the first division in 31 years. It was also a fitting tribute to Bob Carpenter Sr., who had died in June and left Bob Jr. in full control of the team.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Phillies won the National League East in 1980, but to win the league championship, they had to defeat the Houston Astros. In a memorable NLCS, with four of the five games needing extra innings, they fell behind 2–1 but battled back to squeeze past the Astros on a 10th-inning game-winning hit by center fielder Garry Maddox, and the city celebrated its first NL pennant in 30 years.[30] The entire series saw only one home run hit, a game-winning two-run home run by Phillies slugger Greg Luzinski in the Phillies' opening 3–1 win in Game 1 at Philadelphia.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCharlie Manuel took over the club's reins from Bowa after the 2004 season, and general manager Ed Wade was replaced by Pat Gillick in November 2005. Gillick reshaped the club as his own, bringing in players such as Shane Victorino, Jayson Werth, and Jamie Moyer.\n\n\n\n### The Golden era (2006–2012)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2008 World Series, 2009 World Series, and Roy Halladay's perfect game\n\n![](image)Jimmy Rollins, Phillies' shortstop from 2000 to 2014\nRyan Howard won the NL Most Valuable Player Award for the 2006 season and Jimmy Rollins won the award the following year.

They spent most of the first half of the season in first place, and traded first place with the Braves for most of the second half. In the end, they finished two games out of first. Bowa was named National League Manager of the Year.\n\n\nThe Phillies continued to contend for the next few years under Bowa, with the only blemish being an 80–81 season in 2002. On December 6, 2002, Jim Thome, a free agent, signed a six-year, $85 million contract with the team.[37]\n\n\nBetween 1996 and 2002, the team drafted players who would soon become the core of the team including Jimmy Rollins, Pat Burrell, Chase Utley, Ryan Howard, and Cole Hamels.

They won this series in four games to capture their fourth NL pennant; however, they lost to the Baltimore Orioles in the World Series in five games. John Denny was named the 1983 NL Cy Young Award winner. Because of the numerous veterans on the 1983 team, *Philadelphia Daily News* sportswriter Stan Hochman gave them the nickname, the \"Wheeze Kids\".[33]\n\n\nIn 1984, the team finished fourth in the NL East with a record of 81–81. Mike Schmidt still remained a dominant force on the team by leading the National League in both home runs and runs batted in.\n\n\n\n### Years of struggle (1985–1991)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1972, the Phillies were the worst team in baseball, but newly acquired Steve Carlton won nearly half their games (27 of 59 team wins) and was awarded his first NL Cy Young Award and won it again in 1977. Bob Carpenter Jr. retired in 1972 and passed the team ownership to his son Ruly. \n\n\nThe Phillies achieved some success in the mid-1970s. With players such as Carlton, third baseman Mike Schmidt, shortstop Larry Bowa, catcher Bob Boone, and outfielder Greg Luzinski, the Phillies won three straight division titles (1976–78). However, they fell short in the NLCS, against the Reds in 1976 and the Dodgers in 1977 and 1978.

In the final months of the season, a tailspin (triggered by the loss of starting pitcher Curt Simmons to National Guard service) caused the team to lose the next eight of ten games. On the last day of the season, the Phillies hung on to a one-game lead when Dick Sisler’s dramatic tenth inning home run against the Brooklyn Dodgers clinched the Phillies' first pennant in 35 years. In the World Series, exhausted from their late-season plunge and victims of poor luck, the Phillies were swept by the New York Yankees in four straight games.

The main team colors are red and white, with blue serving as a prominent accent. The team name is written in red with a blue star serving as the dot over the \"i\"s, and blue piping is often found in Phillies' branded apparel and materials. The team's home uniform is white with red pinstripes, lettering and numbering. The road uniform is traditional grey with red lettering/numbering. Both bear a script-lettered \"Phillies\" logo, with the aforementioned star dotting the \"i\"s across the chest, and the player name and number on the back. The uniform's front script has undergone minor changes over the years.[90] Hats are red with a single stylized \"P\".[91] The uniforms and logo are very similar to those used during the \"Whiz Kids\" era from 1950 to 1969.\n\n\nThe Phillies and the St. Louis Cardinals are the only MLB teams to use chain stitching in their chest emblems.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe team's competitive futility was highlighted by a record that still stands: in 1961, the Phillies lost 23 games in a row, the worst losing streak in the majors since 1900. Things started to turn around for the team in 1962, when the team finished above .500 for the first time in five years. Gene Mauch was named National League Manager of the Year that season and won it again in 1964. The team improved in 1963, when the team finished the season with an 87–75 record. There was confidence that the team would soon become contenders for a return to the World Series. Though Ashburn and Roberts were gone, the 1964 Phillies still had younger pitchers Art Mahaffey, Chris Short, and rookie Ray Culp; veterans Jim Bunning and screwballer Jack Baldschun; and fan favorites Cookie Rojas, Johnny Callison, and NL Rookie of the Year Dick Allen. The team was 90–60 on September 20, good enough for a lead of 6.5 games in the pennant race with 12 games to play. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n101. **^** Young, Dennis (July 27, 2019). \"The Phillies wore their horrendous Saturday Night Special uniforms and got the same crappy result as 40 years ago\". *nydailynews.com*.

Even today, Phillies' home games can contain many fans sporting caps, shirts, and/or jackets emblazoned with the iconic \"P\" and burgundy color scheme. The current team has worn the burgundy and powder blue throwbacks whenever their opponents are wearing throwback uniforms from that era. Additionally, this uniform also marked the first appearance of \"racing stripes\" on a baseball uniform (striping going down the jersey shoulders, the side of the pants and up to the sides of the jersey up to the armpit), which would be seen on several other MLB teams for the next quarter-century.\n\n\n\n### Controversial uniform changes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPhiladelphia Revolution\nUSPHL\nPittsburgh Vengeance\nWilkes-Barre/Scranton Knights\n |\n| Inline hockey | PIHA\nHarrisburg Lunatics\nPennsylvania Typhoon\nAIHL\nDelco Demons\nPhiladelphia Liberty\nPittsburgh Bandits\nPottstown Team Blue\nScottdale Inferno\n |\n| Lacrosse | NLL\nPhiladelphia Wings\nPLL\nPhiladelphia Waterdogs\nUWLX\nPhiladelphia Force\nWPLL\nPhiladelphia Fire\n |\n| Roller derby | WFTDA\nBlack Rose Rollers\nBrandywine Roller Derby\nDutchland Derby Rollers\nHarrisburg Area Roller Derby\nLehigh Valley Roller Derby\nPhilly Roller Derby\nSteel City Roller Derby\nPenn Jersey Roller Derby\nMRDA\nPenn Jersey Roller Derby\nRDCL\nPenn Jersey Roller Derby\n |\n| Rugby league | USARL\nBucks County Sharks\nPhiladelphia Fight\nPittsburgh Sledgehammers\n |\n| Soccer | MLS\nPhiladelphia Union\nMLS Next Pro\nPhiladelphia Union II\nUSLC\nPittsburgh Riverhounds SC\nUSL2\nLehigh Valley United\nPhiladelphia Lone Star FC\nReading United AC\nWest Chester United SC\nNPSL\nElectric City Shock SC\nErie Commodores FC\nHershey FC\nPittsburgh Hotspurs\nTorch FC\nWPSL\nFC Bucks\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n231. **^** \"Philadelphia Phillies Lead MLB in Attendance For First Time Ever\".

They won the NLDS three games to one against the Milwaukee Brewers, and they defeated the Dodgers in Los Angeles as well, 4–1. As the National League champions, the Phillies advanced to the 2008 World Series to play the Tampa Bay Rays, winning the series 4 games to 1. Game 5 began on Monday, October 27, and was suspended after the top of the 6th inning, with the scored tied 2-2. The game resumed Wednesday, October 29, with the Phillies winning the game 4-3 and capturing their second world series in franchise history. Prior to this, there had never been a rain-shortened game in World Series history, and this was the first suspension. Cole Hamels won the Most Valuable Player Award for both the NLCS and the World Series. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThey lost to the Atlanta Braves 15–7.[101]\n\n\nAnother uniform controversy arose in 1994, when the Phillies introduced all-blue caps on Opening Day that were to be worn for home day games only.[102] The caps were unpopular with the players, who considered them bad luck after two losses and wanted them discontinued. Management wanted to keep using the caps as planned, as they sold well to fans. A compromise was reached: the players agreed to wear them for weekday games while returning to the customary red caps for Sunday afternoon games.[103] In all, the Phillies wore the \"unlucky\" blue caps for seven games in 1994, losing six (the lone victory a 5–2 triumph over the Florida Marlins on June 29).[104] A slightly different blue cap (with a red bill) was introduced in 2008 as part of the alternate home uniform for day games, a throwback to the late 1940s.\n\n\n\n## Rivalries[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n#### City Series: Philadelphia Athletics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: City Series (Philadelphia)\n\nThe City Series was the name of a series of baseball games played between the Philadelphia Athletics of the American League and the Phillies that ran from 1903 through 1955. After the A's move to Kansas City, Missouri in 1955, the City Series rivalry came to an end. The teams have since faced each other in Interleague play (since its introduction in 1997) but the rivalry has effectively died in the intervening years since the A's left Philadelphia. In 2014, when the A's faced the Phillies in inter-league play at Oakland Coliseum, the Athletics did not bother to mark the historical connection, going so far as to have a Connie Mack promotion the day before the series while the Texas Rangers were in Oakland.[120]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n128. **^** \"1993 Philadelphia Phillies\". *Baseball-Reference.com*.

A dark burgundy was adopted as the main team color, with a classic pinstripe style for home uniforms. Blue was almost entirely dropped as part of the team's official color scheme, except in one area; a pale blue (as opposed to traditional grey) was used as the base-color for away game uniforms from 1972 to 1988. Yet the most important aspect of the 1970 uniform change was the adoption of one of the more distinctive logos in sports; a Phillies \"P\" that, thanks to its unique shape and \"baseball stitched\" center swirl, remained instantly recognizable and admired, long after its regular use had ended. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Phillies would take Game 3 by a score of 7-0, which was a result of the team hitting five home runs in the first five innings of the game, the first time this had occurred in World Series history.[86] All five home runs were given up by Astros pitcher Lance McCullers Jr., which became a record for most home runs surrendered by a pitcher in a World Series game.[87] In Game 4, the Astros answered back by winning the game 5-0 and throwing a combined no-hitter, the first combined no-hitter in postseason history, and just the second no-hitter of any type in a World Series after Don Larsen's perfect game in 1956.[88] The Astros won the next two games, winning the series four games to two. The Phillies' game six loss, coming shortly after the Philadelphia Union fell in the championship game of the MLS Cup, made Philadelphia the first American city to lose two major professional sports championship title games in the same day. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n3. **^** Ritchie, Matthew (October 6, 2023). \"Alvarado masquerades as Phils' 'jeweler' with hand-beaded necklaces\". *MLB.com*.

He immediately started signing young players and invested even more money in the farm system, and the Phillies quickly developed a solid core of young players that included future Hall of Famers Richie Ashburn and Robin Roberts. This coincided with the final collapse of the A's. Philadelphia had been an \"A's town\" for most of the first half of the 20th century. Even though the A's had fielded teams as bad or worse than the Phillies for most years since the 1930s, the A's continued to trounce the Phillies at the gate. However, a series of poor baseball and business decisions on the A's part allowed the Phillies to win the hearts of Philadelphia's long-suffering fans.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n54. **^** Zolecki, Todd (September 27, 2010). \"Phour!

As a result, the fan base and attendance at home games increased. Eventually, Cox revealed that he had been betting on the Phillies, and he was banned from baseball by baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis on Nov. 23, 1943. The new owner, Bob Carpenter Sr., scion of the Delaware-based duPont family, bought the team with his son for an estimated $400,000 that same day – November 23, 1943.[19] The Carpenters tried to polish the team's image and way of doing business. Carpenter Sr. named his son, Bob Carpenter, Jr., team president. They wanted to shed the image of failure by changing the team's nickname.\n\n\n\n#### Philadelphia Blue Jays[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **WPct** | Winning percentage: number of wins divided by number of games managed\n |\n| **PA** | Playoff appearances: number of years this manager has led the franchise to the playoffs |\n| **PW** | Playoff wins: number of wins this manager has accrued in the playoffs\n |\n| **PL** | Playoff losses: number of losses this manager has accrued in the playoffs\n |\n| **WS** | World Series: number of World Series victories achieved by the manager\n |\n| † *or* ‡ | Elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame (‡ denotes induction as manager)[126] |\n| § | Member of the Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Phillies' rivalry with the Washington Nationals extends back during their original tenure as the Montreal Expos. The two teams repeatedly battled for control of the division in the early 1980s and mid 1990s. Following the franchise's relocation to Washington DC in 2005; the rivalry increased in geographic tension due to Washington's proximity to Philadelphia. The rivalry quickly spiked in intensity during the 2010s after Nationals team management introduced a campaign to block Phillies fans from overtaking home games. In 2019; star-outfielder Bryce Harper further fueled tensions after signing a 13-year $330 million contract with the Phillies as a free agent.[117][118] The Nationals later managed to win the 2019 World Series during the first year of Harper's absence.[119] The Phillies currently lead the series 482-445, but the Nationals lead the postseason series; when the Expos managed a 3-2 victory over the Phillies during the 1981 NLDS.\n\n\n\n### Historical rivalries[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Phillies' win–loss record never went below .500 during this time; and the team won the NL East five years in a row from 2007 to 2011.[62]\n\n\n\n### End of an era (2013–2018)[edit]\n\n\nDuring the 2013 season, the team struggled again and was unable to consistently play well for the majority of the season. On August 16, 2013, with the team's record at 53–68, the Phillies fired manager Charlie Manuel, who had managed the team since 2005,[63] and promoted third-base coach Ryne Sandberg to interim manager. Manuel had spent over nine years as manager, leading Philadelphia to its first World Series victory in nearly 30 years and amassing an overall record of 780–636 to become the manager with the most wins in the franchise's history. The 2013 Phillies ended up with a record of 73–89, their first losing season since 2002. In the off-season, pitcher Roy Halladay retired from baseball.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Dell Technologies Suite Level\". *Phillies.com*. MLB Advanced Media.

Founded in 1946 and originally known as the **Syracuse Nationals**, they are one of the oldest franchises in the NBA and one of only eight (out of 23) to survive the league's first decade.

The 76ers would push the Celtics to seven games in the semifinals, with the 76ers trailing 110–109 in Game 7. After Hal Greer's pass was stolen by John Havlicek, the Celtics went on to beat the Los Angeles Lakers and win the NBA Championship.

Syracuse was the last of the medium-sized cities housing an NBA team, but by then it was apparent that central New York was no longer large enough to support it. The NBA thus returned to Philadelphia one year after the Warriors had left it. A contest was held to decide on a new name for the team. The winning name, chosen by Walter Stalberg, was the \"76ers\".[13][1] The name comes from the signing of the United States Declaration of Independence in Philadelphia in 1776, although \"Sixers\" was also utilized for shorter referencing.[14] The shorter name was quickly accepted by the team for marketing purposes, and for most of the last half-century \"76ers\" and \"Sixers\" have been officially interchangeable.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNational Basketball Association team in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article's **tone or style may not reflect the encyclopedic tone used on Wikipedia**.

They made a mockery of the Eastern Conference playoffs, first sweeping the New York Knicks and then beating the Milwaukee Bucks in five games. The 76ers went on to win their third NBA championship (and second in Philadelphia) with a four-game sweep of the Los Angeles Lakers, who had defeated them the season before. Malone was named the playoffs' MVP. The 76ers did not quite fulfill Malone's prediction, as their run was actually \"fo', fi', fo\" (\"four, five, four\") – a loss to the Bucks in game four of the Eastern finals being the only blemish on their playoff run. Nonetheless, their 12–1 playoff record is tied for the fewest losses in league history with the 2000–01 Lakers, who went 15–1 en route to the NBA title, coincidentally beating the 76ers in the Finals (after suffering their only defeat that postseason in Game 1), and also with the 2016–2017 Golden State Warriors, who won the title with a 16–1 playoff record. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Moses Malone won MVP honors in 1983, the same year he led the 76ers to their first title in 16 years.\nHarold Katz bought the 76ers from Dixon in 1981.

Led by Hall of Famers Julius Erving, Maurice Cheeks, and All-Stars Andrew Toney and Bobby Jones, they dominated the regular season, winning 65 games in what is still the second most winning year in franchise history. Malone was named League MVP, and when reporters asked how the playoffs would run, he answered, \"four, four, four\"—in other words, saying that the 76ers needed to win four games in each of the 3 rounds. The media misinterpreted this and assumed Moses was predicting that the 76ers would sweep all three rounds to win the title, with the minimum 12 games.[*citation needed*] Malone's accent made his boast sound like \"fo', fo', fo'.\"[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nLos Angeles wrapped up the second of what would be three consecutive NBA titles with a 100–86 win in Game Four and a 108–96 victory in Game Five.\n\n\nIn addition to their Atlantic Division and Eastern Conference titles, the 2000–01 76ers featured the NBA's MVP (Iverson), Coach of the Year (Brown), Defensive Player of the Year (Mutombo), and Sixth Man of the Year (Aaron McKie).\n\n\n\n#### Departure of Larry Brown[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nRelocated National Basketball Association teams\n |\n| --- |\n| * Tri-Cities Blackhawks–Milwaukee Hawks (1951)\n* Milwaukee Hawks–St. Louis Hawks (1955)\n* Fort Wayne Pistons–Detroit Pistons (1957)\n* Rochester Royals–Cincinnati Royals (1957)\n* Minneapolis Lakers–Los Angeles Lakers (1960)\n* Philadelphia Warriors–San Francisco Warriors (1962)\n* Chicago Zephyrs–Baltimore Bullets (1963)\n* Syracuse Nationals–Philadelphia 76ers (1963)\n* St. Louis Hawks–Atlanta Hawks (1968)\n* San Diego Rockets–Houston Rockets (1971)\n* Cincinnati Royals–Kansas City–Omaha Kings (1972)\n* Baltimore Bullets–Capital Bullets (1973)\n* Kansas City–Omaha Kings–Kansas City Kings (1975)\n* Buffalo Braves–San Diego Clippers (1978)\n* New Orleans Jazz–Utah Jazz (1979)\n* San Diego Clippers–Los Angeles Clippers (1984)\n* Kansas City Kings–Sacramento Kings (1985)\n* Vancouver Grizzlies–Memphis Grizzlies (2001)\n* New Orleans Hornets–New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets (2005)\n* New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets–New Orleans Hornets (2007)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n133. **^** Golliver, Ben (August 11, 2022). \"NBA permanently retires Bill Russell's No. 6\". *Washington Post*.

It was based on Rocky because it was from \"'76\".[113]\n\n\nBy virtue of qualifying for the 2018 playoffs, the Sixers were also given an \"Earned\" uniform in the 2018–19 season. The Sixers' \"Earned\" uniforms were similar to the *Rocky* \"City\" uniforms, except that the base was white and the lettering and stars were in blue.[114]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe rivalry was reborn in the 2000s. The first time, the Allen Iverson-led defending-Eastern Conference champions 76ers were defeated in the first round of the 2002 playoffs by the Paul Pierce-led Celtics 3–2. The second time, exactly ten years later, the Big Three Celtics (Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce and Ray Allen) defeated the valiant eight seed 76ers team 4–3. In the ten years in between, the Sixers would experience limited success whereas the Celtics won a championship and contended for most of that span. In a memorable 2006 regular season meeting between the two, the 76ers defeated the Celtics 125–124 in triple overtime, with Iverson leading the way with 33 points and 10 assists.\n\n\n\n## Season-by-season record[edit]\n\n\n*List of the last five seasons completed by the 76ers.

While the NBA has struck a number of partnerships with betting operators following the 2018 US Supreme Court ruling that struck down the federal betting ban, the Fox Bet deal marked the first partnership between a betting operator and an individual NBA team.[81]\n\n\nThe Sixers started off the 2019–20 season with an opening day win at home against the rival Boston Celtics. Before the season, they were expected to be another championship contender, as they were in the past two seasons, especially with Kawhi Leonard having left the conference. They had one of the worst away records in the NBA, but their league-best home record, with only 2 losses, kept the team afloat in the playoff race.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPrior to the 1998–99 season, the 76ers signed George Lynch and Matt Geiger, but a lockout delayed the start of the season, which was shortened to 50 games. During the season, Philadelphia acquired Tyrone Hill in a trade with Milwaukee. The team began its resurgence during this lockout-shortened season, finishing with a 28–22 record and the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs, marking the first time since 1991 the team reached the postseason. In the first round, Philadelphia upset the Orlando Magic 3–1, before being swept by the Indiana Pacers. The following season, the Sixers improved to 49–33, fifth in the Eastern Conference. Again, the Sixers won their first-round series in four games, this time defeating the Charlotte Hornets. For the second straight year, they were defeated by Indiana in the second round, this time in six games. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs had been the case in their three previous Finals appearances, their opponent would be the Los Angeles Lakers, who had run up an 11–0 record in the first three rounds of the playoffs and were expected by many to make quick work of a worn-down 76ers squad. Because of a seemingly meaningless loss to the lowly Chicago Bulls in the regular season finale (both the Sixers and the Lakers finished with identical 56–26 records, but Los Angeles was awarded a higher seed based on tiebreakers), the NBA Finals marked the first time in the 2001 playoffs in which the 76ers had to start a series on the road.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n35. **^** Jasner, Phil. \"Ratliff returns to Sixers with playoff goals\". *philly.com*.

The two teams have the most meetings in the NBA Playoffs, playing each other in nineteen series, of which the Celtics have won twelve.[121] It is considered to be the second-greatest rivalry in the NBA, next to the Celtics–Lakers rivalry.[122] The rivalry first peaked when Wilt Chamberlain and Bill Russell of the Celtics played each other from 1965 to 1968. The 1966–67 Sixers, voted the best team in league history during the NBA's 35th anniversary, set a then-record by winning 68 games in the 81-game season (a record since broken by the Lakers, Bulls and Warriors) and ending Boston's eight-year title reign which led to the infamous \"Boston's Dead!\" chants.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPhiladelphia earned the eighth seed in the 2012 NBA playoffs, facing the first-seeded Bulls. Philadelphia improved from their struggles in the second half of the regular season, beating Chicago 4–2 to win their first series since 2003. This was the fifth time in NBA history that an eight seed has beaten a one seed. They then faced their rival, the Boston Celtics, in the second round, and were eliminated 4–3. The Sixers once again faced criticism for their lack of a true scorer, as they were not able to keep pace with the Celtics' scoring. They were, given credit for winning the regular season series against Boston and forcing the playoff series to seven games against the Celtics, who had won the last four division championships.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 1979–80 | 1980–81 | 1981–82 | **1982–83** | 1983–84 | 1984–85 | 1985–86 | 1986–87 | 1987–88 | 1988–89 |\n |\n| 1990s | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1989–90 | 1990–91 | 1991–92 | 1992–93 | 1993–94 | 1994–95 | 1995–96 | 1996–97 | 1997–98 | 1998–99 |\n |\n| 2000s | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1999–00 | 2000–01 | 2001–02 | 2002–03 | 2003–04 | 2004–05 | 2005–06 | 2006–07 | 2007–08 | 2008–09 |\n |\n| 2010s | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2009–10 | 2010–11 | 2011–12 | 2012–13 | 2013–14 | 2014–15 | 2015–16 | 2016–17 | 2017–18 | 2018–19 |\n |\n| 2020s | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2019–20 | 2020–21 | 2021–22 | 2022–23 | 2023–24 | 2024–25 |  |  |  |  |\n |\n| **Bold** indicates NBA Finals victory\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Philadelphia 76ers retired numbers and honorees** |\n| No.\n | Player\n | Position\n | Tenure\n | Date of Retirement\n |\n| **2** | Moses Malone | C | 1982–19861993–1994 | February 8, 2019[129] |\n| **3** | Allen Iverson | G | 1996–20062009–2010 | March 1, 2014[130] |\n| **4** | Dolph Schayes | F/C | 1948–1964 1 2 | March 12, 2016[131] |\n| **6**3 | Julius Erving | F | 1976–1987 | April 18, 1988\n |\n| **10** | Maurice Cheeks | G | 1978–1989 4 | February 6, 1995\n |\n| **13** | Wilt Chamberlain | C | 1965–1968 5 | March 18, 1991\n |\n| **15** | Hal Greer | G | 1958–1973 6 | November 19, 1976\n |\n| **24** | Bobby Jones | F | 1978–1986 | November 7, 1986\n |\n| **32** | Billy Cunningham | F | 1965–19721974–1976 7 | December 17, 1976\n |\n| **34** | Charles Barkley | F | 1984–1992 | March 30, 2001\n |\n| ![](image) | Dave Zinkoff | Public-addressannouncer | 1963–1985 8 | March 25, 1986\n |\n\n\n**Notes:**\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n117. **^** \"Nike Earned Edition Jersey: Philadelphia 76ers\". *NBA.com*.

The Nationals' reign as defending champions ended with a 109–104 loss in Philadelphia.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Season | GP | W | L | W–L% | Finish | Playoffs\n |\n| 2018–19 | 82 | 51 | 31 | .622 | 2nd, Atlantic | Lost in Conference Semifinals, 3–4 (Raptors)\n |\n| 2019–20 | 73 | 43 | 30 | .589 | 3rd, Atlantic | Lost in First Round, 0–4 (Celtics)\n |\n| 2020–21 | 72 | 49 | 23 | .681 | 1st, Atlantic | Lost in Conference Semifinals, 3–4 (Hawks)\n |\n| 2021–22 | 82 | 51 | 31 | .622 | 2nd, Atlantic | Lost in Conference Semifinals, 2–4 (Heat)\n |\n| 2022–23 | 82 | 54 | 28 | .659 | 2nd, Atlantic | Lost in Conference Semifinals, 3–4 (Celtics)\n |\n\n\n## Facilities[edit]\n\n\n### Home arenas[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nThe Spectrum, shown in 2005, hosted the 76ers from 1967 to 1996.\n![](image)\nWells Fargo Center, known as the CoreStates (1996–1998), First Union (1998–2003), and Wachovia Center (2003–2010), is currently the home arena of the 76ers.\n\n* Convention Hall and Philadelphia Arena (1963–1967)\n* The Spectrum (1967–1996)\n* Wells Fargo Center (1996–present)\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Philadelphia 76ers' original logo featured a stylized red \"7\" and blue \"6\" with 13 blue stars above the \"7\" to represent the original 13 American colonies. During this period the franchise employed many uniform changes.\n\n\nThe original uniform featured \"PHILA\" in front and the aforementioned 13 stars encircling the \"76\" on the shorts and the uniform number at the back. Monochrome red letters were emblazoned on either the blue road or white home uniform, and were written in a similar manner as the logo.[94]\n\n\nDuring the 1965–66 season, the Sixers experimented with a two-tone design. The home white uniform now had a thick red band across the abdomen, while the road uniform featured red tops and blue shorts. \"PHILA\" was positioned below the uniform number.

The ABA's last champions, the New York Nets, were facing a $5 million to the Knicks for \"invading\" the New York area on top of the $3.2 million expansion fee for joining the NBA. So, when the Sixers offered to buy the contract of the Nets' franchise player, Julius Erving, for $3 million—roughly the cost of NBA membership—the Nets had little choice but to accept. A few months before that trade, Kosloff had sold the Sixers to Fitz Eugene Dixon Jr. on May 28, 1976.[21]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Philadelphia-based group Pieces Of A Dream had a minor hit in 1983 with the R&B song \"Fo-Fi-Fo\", which title was prompted by Malone's quip. This also marked the last major-pro championship in Philadelphia until the Phillies won the 2008 World Series.[23]\n\n\n\n#### Arrival of Charles Barkley[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThat led to the 1977–78 motto of \"We owe you one\", which would ultimately backfire when they lost in the conference finals that season to the Washington Bullets, who went on to win the NBA championship. In the next four seasons, the 76ers would fall short of the NBA Championship, even after Shue handed the coaching reins to former great Billy Cunningham. In the 1980 NBA Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers, they lost 4–2. In Game Six, rookie Magic Johnson played center for the Lakers in place of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (who was out because of a sprained ankle sustained in Game Five) and scored 42 points. In the 1981 Eastern Conference Finals, the 76ers opened a 3–1 series lead over the Celtics only to see Boston come back and win the series in seven games. The following season, the 76ers again faced the Celtics in the Eastern Conference Finals, and again jumped to a 3–1 series lead only to see Boston forge a 3–3 series tie. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2006, the Sixers replaced the blue alternates with a red one, bringing back the \"PHILA\" logo for the first time since 1971. As with the other uniforms, the \"PHILA\" wordmark was shaped similarly to the team logo, with the silver star atop the \"I\". White numbers with black trim were placed on this uniform, along with a silver star on the neckline and blue and white striping. The next season saw some minor tweaks to the black and white uniforms, which now featured the same striping patterns as the red alternate along with the silver star.[94][102]\n\n\n\n### 2009–2015[edit]\n\n\nDuring the 2008–09 season, while the previous logo was still in use, the 1977–97 Sixers logo was revived to coincide with the team's 60th anniversary (counting the Syracuse years). After that, the team decided to bring back a modern version of said logo, with the addition of a red square and 'Philadelphia' inside a blue rectangle below it, although the partial logo without the square, city name and rectangles was also used.[103]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFor their first four years in Philadelphia, the 76ers played mostly at the Philadelphia Arena and Civic Center-Convention Hall, with an occasional game at The Palestra at the University of Pennsylvania. Schayes was named head coach, a post he held for four years (the first as player-coach).\n\n\n\n### 1964–1967: Wilt Chamberlain era[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Historical Look at the Sixers\" (PDF). *2023–24 Philadelphia 76ers Media Guide* (PDF).

The Sixers' edition featured a navy blue base and red lettering taken from the 1972–77 uniforms. Red, orange, green and blue blocks on each side paid tribute to the team's former home, the Spectrum, and also represented fan support for each of Philadelphia's \"Big Four\" teams (red representing the Phillies, orange representing the Flyers, green representing the Eagles, and blue representing the 76ers). The Spectrum center court logo, featuring the arena silhouette at the center, adorned the shorts, and the \"S\" from that logo was placed on the waist.[118]\n\n\nThe 2022–23 \"City\" uniform centered around Philadelphia's Greek translation of the \"City of Brotherly Love\", which was inscribed in front of the uniform. The mostly minimalist style uniform has a white base, red text and striping, and blue trim, and was inspired by the city's love of basketball in all levels.[119]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Apollo Global Management co-founder Josh Harris led an investment group that purchased the team for $280 million in 2011.\nFor the season, the Sixers had their best start since 2000–01 with a 20–9 record, battling for the Eastern Conference's best record and taking a firm division lead. They finished the rest of the season 15–22, giving them a 35–31 record. Attributed to their lack of a true go-to scorer,[*citation needed*] the 76ers lost hold of the top-three seed and division championship that they held for most of the season, by going on the losing streak. Nevertheless, they clinched their fourth playoff berth in the last five years on the penultimate play date of the season.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLed by Erving, the 76ers began an exciting ride, beating their long-time rival from Boston in a seven-game playoff series to advance to the Eastern Conference Finals. There, they defeated the Houston Rockets, led by future 76er Moses Malone, in six games to advance to the NBA Finals. In the Finals, they sprinted to a 2–0 series lead over the Bill Walton-led Portland Trail Blazers—who were coached by former 76ers' coach/general manager Jack Ramsay—only to drop the next four games in a row to give the Blazers the title.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Ed Snider purchased the 76ers in 1996.\nStarting with the 1990–91 season, and ending with the 1995–96 season, the 76ers had the dubious distinction of seeing their win total decrease each year. The nadir was the 1995–96 season, when they finished with an 18–64 record, the second-worst in franchise history at the time. It was also the second-worst record in the league that year, ahead of only the expansion Vancouver Grizzlies but behind the Toronto Raptors, who were also in their inaugural season. That season would turn out to be their last in The Spectrum. Katz, unpopular among fans since the 1986 trades, sold the team to Comcast Spectacor, a consortium of Philadelphia Flyers owner Ed Snider and Comcast Corporation, at the end of the 1995–96 season. Snider had been the 76ers' landlord since gaining control of the Spectrum in 1971. Pat Croce, a former trainer for the Flyers and Sixers, took over as president.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n128. **^** Coon, Larry. \"NBA Salary Cap FAQ – 2011 Collective Bargaining Agreement\".

The Sixers struggled heavily after that, at one point posting a 26-game losing streak which set a franchise record,[59] and tied the all-time NBA record for most consecutive losses in a single-season.[60] The Sixers finished the season with a 19–63 record, the third-worst in franchise history. Despite that, the Sixers did not have the worst win–loss record in the overall NBA standings: the Milwaukee Bucks finished worse with a 15–67 record.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn June 16, 1986, Katz made two of the most controversial and highly criticized personnel moves in franchise history, trading Moses Malone to Washington and the first overall pick in the 1986 NBA draft (which had been obtained from the San Diego Clippers in a 1979 trade for Joe Bryant) to the Cleveland Cavaliers. In return, the 76ers received Roy Hinson, Jeff Ruland, and Cliff Robinson, none of whom played more than three seasons with the team. Cleveland, meanwhile, turned their acquired pick into future All-Star Brad Daugherty.\n\n\nOn the night of the 1986–87 season opener, Julius Erving announced he would retire after the season, which was subsequently filled with tributes in each arena the Sixers visited. On the court, the team suffered through an injury-plagued campaign, but still managed to make the playoffs with a 45–37 record. Their season would end at the hands of the Bucks again, this time in a best-of-five first-round series that went the distance.\n\n\n\n### 1987–1992: Charles Barkley era[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 1971–72 season saw the Sixers return to wearing blue uniforms on the road. After sporting \"PHILA\" on the chest for eight seasons, the uniform now read \"Sixers\" in Art Deco style lettering, rendered in white on the road and red at home. Numbers were either white or blue with red trim. Contrasting side stripes were added and extended through the uniform, and either red or white stars were placed on each side. Prior to the 1976–77 season, the Sixers tweaked the uniform, now sporting a block \"Sixers\" wordmark and rounded numbers. The following season, the \"Sixers\" wordmark was changed to Bookman Old Style; on both iterations, \"Sixers\" became blue with red trim on the white uniform, with an additional outline on the latter.[94][98]\n\n\n\n### 1978–1997[edit]\n\n\nIn 1977, the Sixers logo was tweaked to include a white basketball with blue outlines and the suffix \"-ers\" in blue, completing the team nickname.

This time, they played angry but inspired basketball, pulling away to a 120–106 victory and becoming the third NBA road team to win Game 7 after leading the series 3–1. In the game's closing moments, the Boston Garden fans began chanting \"Beat L.A., Beat L.A.\", as they realized their team would lose the playoff series to a hated opponent (Philadelphia 76ers), but nonetheless openly wished that opponent good luck in the next round against a more hated opponent (the Los Angeles Lakers).[22] The team lost the 1982 Finals in six games against the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\n\n\n#### 1982–83: Third NBA championship[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe next year, the 76ers would hire Gene Shue as their head coach and they slowly came back. In the 1975–76 season, the 76ers acquired George McGinnis from the Indiana Pacers of the ABA (after the Knicks tried to sign him, not knowing that the 76ers owned his rights). With him, the 76ers were back in the playoffs after a five-year absence, and even though they lost to the Buffalo Braves in three games, a doctor would come along and get the team healthy enough to stay in perennial contention. During this period, one last personnel misjudgment had effects when the team used the fifth pick overall in the 1975 draft to select Darryl Dawkins directly from high school. The immensely talented and physically imposing Dawkins seldom, if ever, lived up to his great potential in part because of a perpetual adolescence.\n\n\n\n### 1976–1987: Julius Erving era[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSeveral teams began to leave the NBL for the BAA as the foundation for a merger was laid. The Nationals \"recipe for success\" began by recruiting Leo Ferris.[9] Staying in the NBL, Ferris signed Al Cervi to be player-coach and outbid the New York Knicks for the services of Dolph Schayes who made his professional debut,[10] leading the Nationals to a winning record for the first time with a record of 40–23. In the playoffs the Nationals defeated the Hammond Calumet Buccaneers, winning the series in two straight games. In the semifinals, the Nationals lost to the Anderson Duffey Packers for the second straight season in four games. In 1949, when the NBL and the BAA merged into the NBA, the Nationals were one of seven NBL teams that were brought into the NBA.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## Esports ventures[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2016, the 76ers acquired both Team Dignitas and Apex Gaming and merged them under the Dignitas brand, becoming the first North American professional sports team to own an esports team.[136]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* South Philadelphia Sports Complex\n* Sports in Philadelphia\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** As managing partners.

In the 1991–92 season, the 76ers went 35–47 and missed the playoffs for just the second time during Barkley's eight seasons in Philadelphia. On June 17, 1992, Barkley was traded to the Phoenix Suns for Jeff Hornacek, Tim Perry, and Andrew Lang, a deal that was met with harsh criticism.[25]\n\n\n\n### 1992–1996: Dark ages[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the 1967–68 season, with a new home court in the form of The Spectrum to defend their championship, once again the 76ers made it back to the NBA Playoffs and in the rematch of the previous year's semifinals, the 76ers held a 3–1 series lead over the Celtics, before the Celtics staged a dramatic comeback to beat the Sixers in seven games.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 76ers went into the 2001–02 season with high expectations, but were able to produce only a 43–39 record, sixth in the Eastern Conference. In the first round of the playoffs, Philadelphia was defeated 3–2 by the Boston Celtics. In the 2002–03 season, the 76ers sprinted to a 15–4 start, but a 10–20 swoon left them 25–24 at the All-Star break. After the break, the 76ers caught fire, winning nine in a row at one point, and 23 of their last 33 to finish at 48–34, earning the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs. Iverson scored 55 points in the playoff opener against the New Orleans Hornets and the Sixers went on to win the series in six games. In the second round, the Detroit Pistons ended Philadelphia's playoff run in a frustrating six-game series that saw the 76ers lose twice in overtime, and once on a last-second shot in regulation. It would be nine years before the Sixers won another playoff series.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDuring the 2000–01 season, the 76ers got off to a hot start by winning their first ten games and were never seriously challenged in the Atlantic Division. Larry Brown coached the Eastern Conference All-Stars, and Allen Iverson was named MVP of the All-Star Game. Shortly before the All-Star break, Theo Ratliff was lost for the season with a wrist injury, one that would later prove to be devastating to his future career. Despite holding a 41–14 record and a comfortable lead atop both the Atlantic Division and Eastern Conference standings at the time of the February 22 trade deadline, management felt the team needed an established center to advance deep into the playoffs. On that day, Philadelphia acquired Dikembe Mutombo from the Atlanta Hawks in a deal that sent the injured Ratliff along with Nazr Mohammed, Toni Kukoč, and Pepe Sánchez to Atlanta (Sánchez was reacquired later in the season after the Hawks waived him). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 2017–18 season was the most successful season since the 2011–12 season as the team finished the regular season in third place in the Eastern Conference with a 52–30 winning record and clinched a playoff spot.[75] The season also saw the 76ers reaching a franchise-record 16-game winning streak.[76] In the First Round of the playoffs, the Sixers defeated the Heat in five games, to win their first playoff series since the 2011–12 season.\n\n\nFollowing a controversy involving fake Twitter accounts, the 76ers parted ways with general manager Bryan Colangelo on June 7, 2018.[77] The team promoted Elton Brand from executive vice president of basketball operations to fill the vacant general manager role on September 18, 2018.[78]\n\n\nOn November 12, 2018, the 76ers traded Šarić, Robert Covington, Jerryd Bayless and a 2022 second-round draft pick to the Minnesota Timberwolves in exchange for Jimmy Butler and Justin Patton.[79]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain article: Philadelphia 76ers accomplishments and records\n\n### Retired numbers[edit]\n\n\nAll of the 76ers' retired numbers are hanging on the rafters in the Wells Fargo Center\n\n\n\n![](image)Former 76ers public address announcer Dave Zinkoff\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n104. **^** \"Philadelphia 76ers Unveil New Team Uniforms for 2009-10 Season\". *Sixers.com* (Press release).

Side stripes were eliminated and the team logo was emblazoned on the right leg. The road uniform color was changed back to red (with the lettering scheme similar to the 1968–70 red uniforms), and the numbers revert to a block letter style.[94][99]\n\n\nBefore the 1991–92 season, the Sixers experimented with a more radical uniform design. The front featured a blue wave with red, white and blue stars, and \"Sixers\" in Helvetica was affixed above the blue wave. The full city name \"Philadelphia\" was also added above the team name.

They clinched a playoff berth on April 1, 2011, their third in the last four years. The 76ers faced the heavily favored Heat in the first round, and ultimately fell to them in five games. Although they lost the series, Collins was praised for turning around a lottery team in his first season, as well as winning a playoff game when many pundits predicted that the Sixers would be swept. Collins also finished second in Coach of the Year voting.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDespite several teams leaving the NBA for the National Professional Basketball League before the 1950–51 season, the Nationals decided to stay put. In their second NBA season, 1950–51, the Nationals played mediocre basketball all season, finishing in fourth place with a record of 32–34. In the playoffs the Nationals played their best basketball of the season as they stunned the first-place Warriors in two straight, taking Game 1 on the road in overtime 91–89. In the Eastern Finals, the Nationals were beaten by the New York Knickerbockers in a hard-fought five-game series, losing the finale by just two points.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe 76ers went on to finish 56–26, good enough for their first Atlantic Division title since 1989–90 and top seed in the Eastern Conference Playoffs.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Jerry Colangelo joined the team's front office in 2015.\nOn May 19, the 76ers were awarded the third overall pick in the 2015 NBA draft, where they selected Duke center Jahlil Okafor with the third overall pick. The 76ers also signed JP Tokoto with the 58th overall pick. On November 27, the 76ers lost to the Houston Rockets 116–114, giving them a 27-game losing streak dating back to the previous season, which became the longest losing streak in professional sports. During the same game, the Sixers set a franchise record of 16 three pointers made during the losing effort. On December 1, the 76ers beat the Lakers at home by a score of 103–91, but not before setting a league record 28 consecutive losses dating to the 2014–15 season. In doing so, the 76ers also managed to avoid setting a new NBA record of most losses to begin a season. They instead tied the old record of 18 losses set by the then-New Jersey Nets in the 2009–10 season.[67]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Sixers' \"City\" uniform for the 2019–20 season paid homage to the Liberty Bell, featuring an ornate \"Philadelphia\" wordmark and red serifed numbers. The gold bell silhouette is prominently featured on the beltline.[115] The 2020–21 \"City\" uniform paid homage to the Allen Iverson era and the Boathouse Row landmark, featuring a black base with red, blue and white accents. The Boathouse Row illustration is drawn in white above \"Philadelphia\" in white with blue drop shadows. The numbers, also in white with blue drop shadows, are placed on the left chest.[116]\n\n\nThe Sixers' \"Earned\" uniform for 2021 (after qualifying in the 2020 playoffs) featured a blue silhouette of the Liberty Bell on a white background, with white numbers placed in the middle.[117]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe white uniform featured \"Sixers\" in blue and numbers in red, both returning to a block letter style. The red uniform contained both the \"Sixers\" and the uniform number in white. In 2011, a blue alternate uniform was introduced, mirroring that of the red uniform. After 2013, the blue uniform became the primary road set. All three designs employed a more subtle striping along the arms and legs.[104][102]\n\n\n\n### 2015–present[edit]\n\n\nA new version of the classic 76ers logo was unveiled for the 2015–16 season, featuring a slight tilt to the white basketball and a roundel featuring the city name and six stars. A secondary \"Dribbling Ben Franklin\" logo was also introduced.[105]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe switch to Nike in 2017 saw the Sixers make some slight tweaks to their uniform set. The blue \"Icon\" uniform and the white \"Association\" uniform now feature a red drop shadow on the lettering, and the inscription 'Brotherly Love' replaced 'PHILA TOUGH' near the manufacturer's tag.[107][108] The Sixers also released their new red \"Statement\" uniform, featuring a script \"Sixers\" wordmark, off-centered numbers and blue drop shadows.[109] Prior to the 2019–20 season the red uniforms were tweaked to feature a script \"Phila\" wordmark.[110]\n\n\nOn May 16, 2023, the 76ers president of basketball operations, Daryl Morey, announced that Doc Rivers would be dismissed from his position as head coach after three seasons, stating that \"We're grateful for all he did in his three seasons here and thank him for the important impact he made on our franchise. After having the chance to reflect upon our season, we decided that certain changes are necessary to further our goals of competing for a championship.\"[111]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe home white, away blue and red alternate uniforms featured a mix of classic styles used in previous uniforms. The home white and away blue uniforms featured the 'PHILA' wordmark as homage to the late 1960s uniforms, while the red alternates featured the 'SIXERS' wordmark in tribute to the 1980s uniforms. Side stripes featuring seven stars on one side and six on the other pay homage to the 1970s uniforms, while the shoulder piping was a callback to the 1980s uniforms. The inscription 'PHILA TOUGH' is sewed on the bottom of all uniforms.[106]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith the Lakers relocating from Minneapolis to Los Angeles before the 1960–61 season, the Syracuse Nationals became the last old NBL team to still be playing in their original city in the NBA. The Nationals went on to make the playoffs again by finishing in third place with a 38–41 record. The Nationals were dangerous in the playoffs as they stunned the Warriors in three straight games. In the Eastern Finals, the Nationals lost once again to the eventual champion Celtics in five games.\n\n\nSchayes missed 24 games during the 1961–62 season and failed to lead the team in scoring for the first time in 14 years, as Hal Greer led the way with 22.8 points per game. The Nationals finished in third place again with a 41–39 record. In the playoffs, the Nationals lost their first two games to the Warriors on the road. Facing elimination the Nationals won the next two games to force a fifth game in Philadelphia. In Game 5 the Warriors ended the Nationals' season with a 121–104 victory.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n51. **^** \"Spencer Hawes, Jrue Holiday lift 76ers past Trail Blazers\". *ESPN.com*.

In Game One, the 76ers wasted an 18-point lead and lost, 79–78, when Reggie Miller hit a three-pointer in the closing seconds. Philadelphia fought back and won the next three games to win the series. In the Eastern Conference Semifinals, the Sixers squared off against the Toronto Raptors and their superstar, Vince Carter. The teams alternated wins in the first four games, with Iverson scoring 54 points in Philadelphia's Game Two victory. A Game Five win (with Iverson scoring 52 in a 121–88 rout) and Game Six loss set up a decisive Game Seven, which the 76ers survived as Carter missed a long jump shot at the buzzer for an 88–87 victory that sent the Sixers to the Eastern Conference Finals against the Milwaukee Bucks. After the teams split the first two games of the series in Philadelphia, it was learned Iverson would miss Game Three due to various nagging injuries that had plagued him late in the season. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Under Seymour, the Nationals rebounded and finished the 1956–57 season in second place with a record of 38–34. In the playoffs, the Nationals had trouble knocking off the defending champion Warriors advancing to the Eastern Finals with two straight wins. The Nationals were swept in three games by the eventual champions, the Celtics.\n\n\nFort Wayne and Rochester had moved on to Detroit and Cincinnati for the 1957–58 season, leaving the Syracuse Nationals as the last small-town team in the big city NBA. That did not matter on the court as the Nationals held their own finishing in second place with a 41–31 record. In the playoffs, the Nationals fell in the first round as they lost a three-game series to the Philadelphia Warriors.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Sixers unveiled a cleaner design for the 1966–67 season, with \"PHILA\" in red block letters and trimmed in either white or blue. \"PHILA\" was also moved back above the number. The logo and stars were removed in favor of simple side stripes. Initially, the Sixers wore blue uniforms on the road, but in 1968, they changed back to red uniforms with \"PHILA\" in white with blue trim.[94][96]\n\n\nFor the 1970–71 season, the Sixers tinkered with their red uniforms, switching the color scheme on the letters to blue with white trim. Meanwhile, the white uniform received a more radical makeover, featuring the full name \"Seventy Sixers\" in red cursive lettering with blue trim. This set lasted for only one season.[94][96][97]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn June 23, 2016, following the 2015–16 season, and after the 76ers were awarded the first overall pick in the 2016 draft, the team selected LSU Point Forward Ben Simmons first overall. The Sixers also selected French basketball player Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot and Turkish basketball player Furkan Korkmaz with the 24th and 26th picks in the 2016 NBA draft respectively.[72] Many consider the 2016 NBA Draft a turning point for the 76ers after their three seasons of not being competitive resulted in the franchise garnering the first overall pick, the first time the team owned the first since 1996 when the 76ers selected point guard Allen Iverson first overall.[73] The Sixers subsequently traded for another number one pick in the 2017 NBA draft, choosing Markelle Fultz.[74]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDespite a mediocre 35–37 record for the 1958–59 season the Nationals made the playoffs again by finishing in third place. In the playoffs, the Nationals swept the Knickerbockers in two straight to reach the Eastern Finals, where they lost to the eventual champion Celtics, alternating wins before losing by 5 points in Game 7.\n\n\nPlaying in a league now dominated by superstars like Bill Russell of the Celtics, Wilt Chamberlain of the Warriors, Bob Pettit of the St. Louis Hawks and Elgin Baylor of the Lakers, the Nationals held their own posting a solid 45–30 record, while finishing in third place after the 1959–60 regular season. In the playoffs, the Nationals lost a three-game series to Chamberlain and the Warriors.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCervi, playing less and coaching more, emphasized a patient offense and a scrappy defense, which led the league in the 1951–52 season by yielding a stingy 79.5 points per game as the Nationals won the Eastern Division with a solid 40–26 record. In the playoffs, the Nationals knocked off the Warriors again in a three-game series. In the Eastern Finals, the Nationals fell to the Knickerbockers again, dropping the series in four games.\n\n\nThe Nationals finished in second place in a hard-fought 3-way battle for first place in the Eastern Division for the 1952–53 season, with a record of 47–24. In the playoffs, the Nationals faced the Boston Celtics dropping Game 1 at home 87–81. Needing a win in Boston to keep their hopes alive, the Nationals took the Celtics deep into overtime before losing in quadruple OT 111–105, in what remains the longest playoff game in NBA history.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 2007, the Sixers drafted small forward Thaddeus Young with the 12th pick. On December 4, 2007, the Sixers fired King and replaced him with Nets' general manager Ed Stefanski.[27]\n\n\nWith Iguodala, the Sixers clinched a playoff berth with a win over the Atlanta Hawks on April 4, 2008. It was their first postseason appearance since 2005, as well as the first in the post-Iverson era. They were eliminated by the Pistons in six games, with Detroit winning the series 4–2. Even with this elimination, many fans considered this to be a successful season, considering that the Sixers were 12 games under .500 in early February and went on make the playoffs and a 40–42 record.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* National Constitution Center\n* National Liberty Museum\n* National Museum of American Jewish History\n* Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts\n* Philadelphia History Museum\n* Philadelphia Museum of Art\n* Philadelphia's Magic Gardens\n* Please Touch Museum\n* Powel House\n* RittenhouseTown\n* Rodin Museum\n* Rosenbach Museum and Library\n* Ryerss Museum and Library\n* Science History Institute\n* Shofuso Japanese House and Garden\n* Stenton\n* Thaddeus Kosciuszko National Memorial\n* Penn Museum\n* Wagner Free Institute of Science\n* Woodmere Art Museum\n* Wyck House\n |\n| Sports | * 76ers\n* Eagles\n* Flyers\n* Freedoms\n* Phillies\n* Union\n |\n| Squares | * Centre\n* Franklin\n* Logan\n* Rittenhouse\n* Washington\n |\n| Related | * Delaware Valley\n* Carpenters' Hall\n* Independence Hall\n* Congress Hall\n* Liberty Bell\n* Syng inkstand\n* SS *United States*\n* 2016 Democratic National Convention\n |\n| * ![](image) Category\n* ![](image) Portal\n |\n |\n\nPortals:* ![icon](image) Basketball\n* ![](image) Philadelphia\n* ![flag](image) Pennsylvania\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 2007, NBA historian Kyle Wright argued that the 1992–93 Dallas Mavericks and 1997–98 Denver Nuggets, both of whom won eleven games, plus the inaugural Cleveland Cavaliers, who won 15 games, were actually poorer teams due to much weaker schedules.[20]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Seattle SuperSonics–Oklahoma City Thunder (2008)\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNational Basketball Association\n |\n| --- |\n| EasternConference | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Atlantic | Boston Celtics\nBrooklyn Nets\nNew York Knicks\nPhiladelphia 76ers\nToronto Raptors\n |\n| Central | Chicago Bulls\nCleveland Cavaliers\nDetroit Pistons\nIndiana Pacers\nMilwaukee Bucks\n |\n| Southeast | Atlanta Hawks\nCharlotte Hornets\nMiami Heat\nOrlando Magic\nWashington Wizards\n |\n\n |\n| WesternConference | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Northwest | Denver Nuggets\nMinnesota Timberwolves\nOklahoma City Thunder\nPortland Trail Blazers\nUtah Jazz\n |\n| Pacific | Golden State Warriors\nLos Angeles Clippers\nLos Angeles Lakers\nPhoenix Suns\nSacramento Kings\n |\n| Southwest | Dallas Mavericks\nHouston Rockets\nMemphis Grizzlies\nNew Orleans Pelicans\nSan Antonio Spurs\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Nationals acquired Alex Groza, and Ralph Beard as the Indianapolis Olympians folded leaving the NBA with just 9 teams for the 1953–54 season. Once again the Nationals battled for the Division title falling two games short with a 42–30 record. In the playoffs, the Nationals won all four games of a round-robin tournament involving the three playoff teams from the East. In the Eastern Finals, the Nationals beat the Celtics in two straight games. In the NBA Finals, the Nationals lost to the Lakers in a hard-fought seven-game series where the two teams alternated wins throughout.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThough in the 2004–05 season the 76ers exceeded many on-court expectations, there was a great deal of behind-the-scenes tension between O'Brien, his players, and the front office. Shortly after the season ended, O'Brien was fired and replaced by the popular Maurice Cheeks, who played for the team from 1978 to 1989, and was the starting point guard for the 1983 NBA Champions. The coaching change did not help the team's fortunes for the 2005–06 season. A 2–10 stretch in March doomed them to missing the playoffs for the second time in three years with a 38–44 record.\n\n\nWith the opening of the 2006–07 season, the 76ers started out hot, going 3–0 for the first time since making it to the Finals five years previously. They stumbled through the first half of the season and did not recover, finishing 35–47, good for third in the Atlantic Division, and ninth in the Eastern Conference (tied with Indiana).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nRubin was fired after 51 games and a 4-47 record; as it turned out, it would be his only NBA coaching job. He was succeeded by player-coach Kevin Loughery, who went 5–26 the rest of the way. The 76ers finished an NBA-record 59 games behind the Atlantic Division champion Boston Celtics. Only six years after tallying the most wins in NBA history, the 1972–73 squad notched the fourth-fewest wins in NBA history, and still the fewest for a full 82-game season. The 73 losses, although threatened several times, remains the all-time low-water mark for any NBA franchise. The 76ers' 0.110 winning percentage was a record worst at the time, and would remain the lowest until the 2011–12 Charlotte Bobcats finished 7–59 for a .106 winning percentage in a season shortened due to a lockout. The 76ers of 1972–73 are generally considered to be the worst team ever to take the court in NBA history. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHershey FC\nPennsylvania Classics AC\nPittsburgh Hotspurs\nUWS\nLancaster Inferno FC\nUWS2\nErie Commodores FC\n |\n| Indoor soccer | MASL\nHarrisburg Heat\n |\n| Softball |  |\n| Tennis | WTT\nPhiladelphia Freedoms\n |\n| Ultimate | AUDL\nPhiladelphia Phoenix\nPittsburgh Thunderbirds\n |\n| College athletics(NCAA Division I) | Bucknell Bison\nDrexel Dragons\nDuquesne Dukes\nLa Salle Explorers\nLafayette Leopards\nLehigh Mountain Hawks\n*Mercyhurst Lakers (Division I in July 2024)*\nPenn Quakers\nPenn State Nittany Lions\nPittsburgh Panthers\nRobert Morris Colonials\nSaint Francis Red Flash\nSaint Joseph's Hawks\nTemple Owls\nVillanova Wildcats\n |\n| * Sports in Pennsylvania\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith an aging team, the Nationals were expected to fade; however, with the scrappy play of Johnny Kerr, the Nationals remained a strong contender, finishing in second place for the 1962–63 season, with a record of 48–32. In the playoffs the Nationals faced the Cincinnati Royals, getting off to a 2–1 series lead. Needing one win to advance to the Eastern Finals again the Nationals lost two straight, dropping the decisive fifth game at home in overtime 131–127.\n\n\n\n### Relocation to Philadelphia[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFollowing the suspension of the 2019–20 NBA season, the 76ers were one of the 22 teams invited to the NBA Bubble to participate in the final eight games of the regular season.[82] The Sixers started the bubble in the sixth seed, tied with the Pacers, who had the tiebreaker. The regular season finished with the 76ers in the sixth seed, a notable decrease in position from the previous two seasons. In the first round of the playoffs, the 76ers were eliminated by the Celtics in a 4–0 sweep. Head coach Brett Brown was fired on August 24, 2020.\n\n\n\n#### 2020–present: Morey era[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the finals the Nationals would get off to a fast start, led by forward Schayes, taking the first two games at home against the Fort Wayne Pistons.[12] As the series moved to Fort Wayne the Pistons would spark back to life taking all three games to take a 3–2 series lead. Back in Syracuse for Game 6 on the Nationals kept Championship hopes alive by beating the Pistons 109–104 to force a seventh game at home. Game 7 would be as tight as the series as George King sank a free throw to give the Nationals a 92–91 lead in the final seconds. King then stole the inbound pass to clinch the NBA Championship for the Nationals.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n59. **^** \"Pacers send Sixers to team-record 21st straight loss\". *philly-archives*.

The design contained thick blue stripes within either thin red or white stripes, and the letters were changed to a more classic rounded style. Numbers were now rendered in blue on both uniforms with either white or red trim, and the white uniform again featured \"Sixers\" in red letters with white and blue trim.[94][101]\n\n\n\n### 1997–2009[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1997–98 season, the Sixers drastically changed their logo and colors in an effort to appeal to the more youthful hip-hop-oriented culture. Red, white and blue were retained, but only as trim colors. Instead, the Sixers used black, silver and gold as its core colors, with the logo now featuring 76ers in gold, a single silver star within the 7, and a streaking basketball below the logo.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Andre Iguodala was drafted by the 76ers in 2004\nFor the 2004–05 season, Philadelphia native Jim O'Brien was named head coach. Iverson was moved back to point guard and flourished, having arguably his finest season. He also impressed many with his willingness to get other players involved in the offense. During this season, Philadelphia acquired Chris Webber in a trade with the Sacramento Kings, with the hopes that the team had at long last found a consistent second scoring option to complement Iverson. Andre Iguodala, Philadelphia's first-round pick in the 2004 NBA draft, was named to the All-Rookie First Team, and the 76ers returned to the postseason with a 43–39 record. In the first round, they were defeated in five games by the defending NBA Champion Pistons, coached by Larry Brown.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter a disappointing 1983–84 season, which ended with a five-game loss to the upstart New Jersey Nets in the first round of the playoffs, Charles Barkley arrived in Philadelphia for the 1984–85 season. For the next eight seasons, Barkley brought delight to the Philadelphia fans thanks to his humorous and sometimes controversial ways.[24] The Sixers returned to the Eastern Conference Finals in Barkley's rookie season, but lost to the Boston Celtics in five games. As it turned out, they would never again advance as far during Barkley's tenure in Philadelphia. Following the 1984–85 season, Matt Guokas replaced Billy Cunningham as head coach. Guokas led the 76ers to a 54–28 record and the second round of the 1986 playoffs, where they were defeated by the Milwaukee Bucks in seven games.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_DHrzxsOxMsIRtIF4j3aLC82F","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

This time the 76ers beat the Celtics in five games. In Game Five of that series, as the 76ers went to victory and the NBA Finals, Philadelphia fans chanted \"Boston is dead!\"—a symbol that the Celts' eight-year reign as NBA champion had ended. The Finals were almost anticlimactic, with the Sixers ousting the Warriors in six games to give them their second NBA Championship. The 1966–67 Sixers were voted the best team in league history during the NBA's 35th anniversary celebration in October 1980.\n\n\n\n### 1967–1976: Fall of the 76ers[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **Philadelphia 76ers**, colloquially known as the **Sixers**, are an American professional basketball team based in the Philadelphia metropolitan area.[b] The 76ers compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference. The team plays its home games at the Wells Fargo Center located in the South Philadelphia Sports Complex. Founded in 1946 and originally known as the **Syracuse Nationals**, they are one of the oldest franchises in the NBA and one of only eight (out of 23) to survive the league's first decade. The team is owned and managed by Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment (HBSE), with founders Josh Harris and David Blitzer having owned the team since 2011.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Philadelphia 76ers |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) *2023–24 Philadelphia 76ers season* |\n| ![Philadelphia 76ers logo](image) |\n| Conference | Eastern |\n| Division | Atlantic |\n| Founded | 1946 |\n| History | **Syracuse Nationals**1946–1949 (NBL)1949–1963 (NBA)**Philadelphia 76ers**1963–present[1][2][3] |\n| Arena | Wells Fargo Center |\n| Location | Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |\n| Team colors | Blue, red, silver, navy, white[4][5][6]          |\n| Main sponsor | Crypto.com[7] |\n| CEO | Tad Brown |\n| President | Daryl Morey |\n| General manager | Elton Brand |\n| Head coach | Nick Nurse |\n| Ownership | Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment (Josh Harris and David Blitzer)[a] |\n| Affiliation(s) | Delaware Blue Coats |\n| Championships | **3** (1955, 1967, 1983) |\n| Conference titles | **5** (1977, 1980, 1982, 1983, 2001) |\n| Division titles | **12** (1950, 1952, 1955, 1966, 1967, 1968, 1977, 1978, 1983, 1990, 2001, 2021) |\n| Retired numbers | **10** (2, 3, 4, 6, 10, 13, 15, 24, 32, 34) |\n| Website | www.nba.com/sixers |\n|  |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNPSL\nAtlantic City FC\nTorch FC\n |\n| Tennis | WTT\nPhiladelphia Freedoms (defunct)\n |\n| Lacrosse | NLL\nPhiladelphia Wings\nPLL\nPhiladelphia Waterdogs\n |\n| Ultimate | AUDL\nPhiladelphia Phoenix\n |\n| College athletics (NCAA Div.

The 76ers would push the Celtics to seven games in the semifinals, with the 76ers trailing 110–109 in Game 7. After Hal Greer's pass was stolen by John Havlicek, the Celtics went on to beat the Los Angeles Lakers and win the NBA Championship. On December 3, 1965, in the midst of a game at the Boston Garden, co-owner Richman suffered a heart attack and died courtside.[15]\n\n\n\n#### 1966–67: First title in Philadelphia[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe playoff overtime loss on March 26, 1963, would prove to be the last game for the Syracuse Nationals, as investors Irv Kosloff and Ike Richman purchased the team from Danny Biasone and moved the team to Philadelphia, filling the void left by the Warriors, who had moved to San Francisco. Syracuse was the last of the medium-sized cities housing an NBA team, but by then it was apparent that central New York was no longer large enough to support it. The NBA thus returned to Philadelphia one year after the Warriors had left it. A contest was held to decide on a new name for the team. The winning name, chosen by Walter Stalberg, was the \"76ers\".[13][1] The name comes from the signing of the United States Declaration of Independence in Philadelphia in 1776, although \"Sixers\" was also utilized for shorter referencing.[14] The shorter name was quickly accepted by the team for marketing purposes, and for most of the last half-century \"76ers\" and \"Sixers\" have been officially interchangeable.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNational Basketball Association team in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article's **tone or style may not reflect the encyclopedic tone used on Wikipedia**.

The Larry Bird-led Celtics won five of them, while the Julius Erving-led 76ers won the other three. The Charles Barkley-led Sixers of the later 1980s took the fight to the Celtics; neither team experienced much playoff success in the late 1980s, and both took steep nosedives in the Eastern Conference rankings throughout the 1990s.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Links to related articles\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nPhiladelphia 76ers seasons\n |\n| --- |\n| * Franchise\n* Seasons\n |\n| 1940s | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 1946–47 | 1947–48 | 1948–49 |\n |\n| 1950s | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1949–50 | 1950–51 | 1951–52 | 1952–53 | 1953–54 | **1954–55** | 1955–56 | 1956–57 | 1957–58 | 1958–59 |\n |\n| 1960s | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1959–60 | 1960–61 | 1961–62 | 1962–63 | 1963–64 | 1964–65 | 1965–66 | **1966–67** | 1967–68 | 1968–69 |\n |\n| 1970s | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1969–70 | 1970–71 | 1971–72 | 1972–73 | 1973–74 | 1974–75 | 1975–76 | 1976–77 | 1977–78 | 1978–79 |\n |\n| 1980s | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe 76ers backed up Malone's boast. They made a mockery of the Eastern Conference playoffs, first sweeping the New York Knicks and then beating the Milwaukee Bucks in five games. The 76ers went on to win their third NBA championship (and second in Philadelphia) with a four-game sweep of the Los Angeles Lakers, who had defeated them the season before. Malone was named the playoffs' MVP. The 76ers did not quite fulfill Malone's prediction, as their run was actually \"fo', fi', fo\" (\"four, five, four\") – a loss to the Bucks in game four of the Eastern finals being the only blemish on their playoff run. Nonetheless, their 12–1 playoff record is tied for the fewest losses in league history with the 2000–01 Lakers, who went 15–1 en route to the NBA title, coincidentally beating the 76ers in the Finals (after suffering their only defeat that postseason in Game 1), and also with the 2016–2017 Golden State Warriors, who won the title with a 16–1 playoff record. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Moses Malone won MVP honors in 1983, the same year he led the 76ers to their first title in 16 years.\nHarold Katz bought the 76ers from Dixon in 1981. On his watch, the final piece of the championship puzzle was completed before the 1982–83 season when they acquired center Moses Malone from the Houston Rockets. Led by Hall of Famers Julius Erving, Maurice Cheeks, and All-Stars Andrew Toney and Bobby Jones, they dominated the regular season, winning 65 games in what is still the second most winning year in franchise history. Malone was named League MVP, and when reporters asked how the playoffs would run, he answered, \"four, four, four\"—in other words, saying that the 76ers needed to win four games in each of the 3 rounds. The media misinterpreted this and assumed Moses was predicting that the 76ers would sweep all three rounds to win the title, with the minimum 12 games.[*citation needed*] Malone's accent made his boast sound like \"fo', fo', fo'.\"[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nLos Angeles wrapped up the second of what would be three consecutive NBA titles with a 100–86 win in Game Four and a 108–96 victory in Game Five.\n\n\nIn addition to their Atlantic Division and Eastern Conference titles, the 2000–01 76ers featured the NBA's MVP (Iverson), Coach of the Year (Brown), Defensive Player of the Year (Mutombo), and Sixth Man of the Year (Aaron McKie).\n\n\n\n#### Departure of Larry Brown[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nRelocated National Basketball Association teams\n |\n| --- |\n| * Tri-Cities Blackhawks–Milwaukee Hawks (1951)\n* Milwaukee Hawks–St. Louis Hawks (1955)\n* Fort Wayne Pistons–Detroit Pistons (1957)\n* Rochester Royals–Cincinnati Royals (1957)\n* Minneapolis Lakers–Los Angeles Lakers (1960)\n* Philadelphia Warriors–San Francisco Warriors (1962)\n* Chicago Zephyrs–Baltimore Bullets (1963)\n* Syracuse Nationals–Philadelphia 76ers (1963)\n* St. Louis Hawks–Atlanta Hawks (1968)\n* San Diego Rockets–Houston Rockets (1971)\n* Cincinnati Royals–Kansas City–Omaha Kings (1972)\n* Baltimore Bullets–Capital Bullets (1973)\n* Kansas City–Omaha Kings–Kansas City Kings (1975)\n* Buffalo Braves–San Diego Clippers (1978)\n* New Orleans Jazz–Utah Jazz (1979)\n* San Diego Clippers–Los Angeles Clippers (1984)\n* Kansas City Kings–Sacramento Kings (1985)\n* Vancouver Grizzlies–Memphis Grizzlies (2001)\n* New Orleans Hornets–New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets (2005)\n* New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets–New Orleans Hornets (2007)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n133. **^** Golliver, Ben (August 11, 2022). \"NBA permanently retires Bill Russell's No. 6\". *Washington Post*.

It was based on Rocky because it was from \"'76\".[113]\n\n\nBy virtue of qualifying for the 2018 playoffs, the Sixers were also given an \"Earned\" uniform in the 2018–19 season. The Sixers' \"Earned\" uniforms were similar to the *Rocky* \"City\" uniforms, except that the base was white and the lettering and stars were in blue.[114]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe rivalry was reborn in the 2000s. The first time, the Allen Iverson-led defending-Eastern Conference champions 76ers were defeated in the first round of the 2002 playoffs by the Paul Pierce-led Celtics 3–2. The second time, exactly ten years later, the Big Three Celtics (Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce and Ray Allen) defeated the valiant eight seed 76ers team 4–3. In the ten years in between, the Sixers would experience limited success whereas the Celtics won a championship and contended for most of that span. In a memorable 2006 regular season meeting between the two, the 76ers defeated the Celtics 125–124 in triple overtime, with Iverson leading the way with 33 points and 10 assists.\n\n\n\n## Season-by-season record[edit]\n\n\n*List of the last five seasons completed by the 76ers.

While the NBA has struck a number of partnerships with betting operators following the 2018 US Supreme Court ruling that struck down the federal betting ban, the Fox Bet deal marked the first partnership between a betting operator and an individual NBA team.[81]\n\n\nThe Sixers started off the 2019–20 season with an opening day win at home against the rival Boston Celtics. Before the season, they were expected to be another championship contender, as they were in the past two seasons, especially with Kawhi Leonard having left the conference. They had one of the worst away records in the NBA, but their league-best home record, with only 2 losses, kept the team afloat in the playoff race.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPrior to the 1998–99 season, the 76ers signed George Lynch and Matt Geiger, but a lockout delayed the start of the season, which was shortened to 50 games. During the season, Philadelphia acquired Tyrone Hill in a trade with Milwaukee. The team began its resurgence during this lockout-shortened season, finishing with a 28–22 record and the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs, marking the first time since 1991 the team reached the postseason. In the first round, Philadelphia upset the Orlando Magic 3–1, before being swept by the Indiana Pacers. The following season, the Sixers improved to 49–33, fifth in the Eastern Conference. Again, the Sixers won their first-round series in four games, this time defeating the Charlotte Hornets. For the second straight year, they were defeated by Indiana in the second round, this time in six games. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs had been the case in their three previous Finals appearances, their opponent would be the Los Angeles Lakers, who had run up an 11–0 record in the first three rounds of the playoffs and were expected by many to make quick work of a worn-down 76ers squad. Because of a seemingly meaningless loss to the lowly Chicago Bulls in the regular season finale (both the Sixers and the Lakers finished with identical 56–26 records, but Los Angeles was awarded a higher seed based on tiebreakers), the NBA Finals marked the first time in the 2001 playoffs in which the 76ers had to start a series on the road.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n35. **^** Jasner, Phil. \"Ratliff returns to Sixers with playoff goals\". *philly.com*.

The two teams have the most meetings in the NBA Playoffs, playing each other in nineteen series, of which the Celtics have won twelve.[121] It is considered to be the second-greatest rivalry in the NBA, next to the Celtics–Lakers rivalry.[122] The rivalry first peaked when Wilt Chamberlain and Bill Russell of the Celtics played each other from 1965 to 1968. The 1966–67 Sixers, voted the best team in league history during the NBA's 35th anniversary, set a then-record by winning 68 games in the 81-game season (a record since broken by the Lakers, Bulls and Warriors) and ending Boston's eight-year title reign which led to the infamous \"Boston's Dead!\" chants.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPhiladelphia earned the eighth seed in the 2012 NBA playoffs, facing the first-seeded Bulls. Philadelphia improved from their struggles in the second half of the regular season, beating Chicago 4–2 to win their first series since 2003. This was the fifth time in NBA history that an eight seed has beaten a one seed. They then faced their rival, the Boston Celtics, in the second round, and were eliminated 4–3. The Sixers once again faced criticism for their lack of a true scorer, as they were not able to keep pace with the Celtics' scoring. They were, given credit for winning the regular season series against Boston and forcing the playoff series to seven games against the Celtics, who had won the last four division championships.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 1979–80 | 1980–81 | 1981–82 | **1982–83** | 1983–84 | 1984–85 | 1985–86 | 1986–87 | 1987–88 | 1988–89 |\n |\n| 1990s | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1989–90 | 1990–91 | 1991–92 | 1992–93 | 1993–94 | 1994–95 | 1995–96 | 1996–97 | 1997–98 | 1998–99 |\n |\n| 2000s | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1999–00 | 2000–01 | 2001–02 | 2002–03 | 2003–04 | 2004–05 | 2005–06 | 2006–07 | 2007–08 | 2008–09 |\n |\n| 2010s | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2009–10 | 2010–11 | 2011–12 | 2012–13 | 2013–14 | 2014–15 | 2015–16 | 2016–17 | 2017–18 | 2018–19 |\n |\n| 2020s | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2019–20 | 2020–21 | 2021–22 | 2022–23 | 2023–24 | 2024–25 |  |  |  |  |\n |\n| **Bold** indicates NBA Finals victory\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Philadelphia 76ers retired numbers and honorees** |\n| No.\n | Player\n | Position\n | Tenure\n | Date of Retirement\n |\n| **2** | Moses Malone | C | 1982–19861993–1994 | February 8, 2019[129] |\n| **3** | Allen Iverson | G | 1996–20062009–2010 | March 1, 2014[130] |\n| **4** | Dolph Schayes | F/C | 1948–1964 1 2 | March 12, 2016[131] |\n| **6**3 | Julius Erving | F | 1976–1987 | April 18, 1988\n |\n| **10** | Maurice Cheeks | G | 1978–1989 4 | February 6, 1995\n |\n| **13** | Wilt Chamberlain | C | 1965–1968 5 | March 18, 1991\n |\n| **15** | Hal Greer | G | 1958–1973 6 | November 19, 1976\n |\n| **24** | Bobby Jones | F | 1978–1986 | November 7, 1986\n |\n| **32** | Billy Cunningham | F | 1965–19721974–1976 7 | December 17, 1976\n |\n| **34** | Charles Barkley | F | 1984–1992 | March 30, 2001\n |\n| ![](image) | Dave Zinkoff | Public-addressannouncer | 1963–1985 8 | March 25, 1986\n |\n\n\n**Notes:**\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n117. **^** \"Nike Earned Edition Jersey: Philadelphia 76ers\". *NBA.com*.

The home white uniform now had a thick red band across the abdomen, while the road uniform featured red tops and blue shorts. \"PHILA\" was positioned below the uniform number. Players disliked the design and was replaced after only one season.[94][95]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPhiladelphia Revolution\nUSPHL\nPittsburgh Vengeance\nWilkes-Barre/Scranton Knights\n |\n| Inline hockey | PIHA\nHarrisburg Lunatics\nPennsylvania Typhoon\nAIHL\nDelco Demons\nPhiladelphia Liberty\nPittsburgh Bandits\nPottstown Team Blue\nScottdale Inferno\n |\n| Lacrosse | NLL\nPhiladelphia Wings\nPLL\nPhiladelphia Waterdogs\nUWLX\nPhiladelphia Force\nWPLL\nPhiladelphia Fire\n |\n| Roller derby | WFTDA\nBlack Rose Rollers\nBrandywine Roller Derby\nDutchland Derby Rollers\nHarrisburg Area Roller Derby\nLehigh Valley Roller Derby\nPhilly Roller Derby\nSteel City Roller Derby\nPenn Jersey Roller Derby\nMRDA\nPenn Jersey Roller Derby\nRDCL\nPenn Jersey Roller Derby\n |\n| Rugby league | USARL\nBucks County Sharks\nPhiladelphia Fight\nPittsburgh Sledgehammers\n |\n| Soccer | MLS\nPhiladelphia Union\nMLS Next Pro\nPhiladelphia Union II\nUSLC\nPittsburgh Riverhounds SC\nUSL2\nLehigh Valley United\nPhiladelphia Lone Star FC\nReading United AC\nWest Chester United SC\nNPSL\nElectric City Shock SC\nErie Commodores FC\nHershey FC\nPittsburgh Hotspurs\nTorch FC\nWPSL\nFC Bucks\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Julius Erving played 11 seasons with the 76ers (1976–1987), and played in four NBA Finals, ultimately winning in 1983.\nThe Sixers finally came all the way back in 1976–77, in large part due to the ABA–NBA merger. The ABA's last champions, the New York Nets, were facing a $5 million to the Knicks for \"invading\" the New York area on top of the $3.2 million expansion fee for joining the NBA. So, when the Sixers offered to buy the contract of the Nets' franchise player, Julius Erving, for $3 million—roughly the cost of NBA membership—the Nets had little choice but to accept. A few months before that trade, Kosloff had sold the Sixers to Fitz Eugene Dixon Jr. on May 28, 1976.[21]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Philadelphia-based group Pieces Of A Dream had a minor hit in 1983 with the R&B song \"Fo-Fi-Fo\", which title was prompted by Malone's quip. This also marked the last major-pro championship in Philadelphia until the Phillies won the 2008 World Series.[23]\n\n\n\n#### Arrival of Charles Barkley[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThat led to the 1977–78 motto of \"We owe you one\", which would ultimately backfire when they lost in the conference finals that season to the Washington Bullets, who went on to win the NBA championship. In the next four seasons, the 76ers would fall short of the NBA Championship, even after Shue handed the coaching reins to former great Billy Cunningham. In the 1980 NBA Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers, they lost 4–2. In Game Six, rookie Magic Johnson played center for the Lakers in place of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (who was out because of a sprained ankle sustained in Game Five) and scored 42 points. In the 1981 Eastern Conference Finals, the 76ers opened a 3–1 series lead over the Celtics only to see Boston come back and win the series in seven games. The following season, the 76ers again faced the Celtics in the Eastern Conference Finals, and again jumped to a 3–1 series lead only to see Boston forge a 3–3 series tie. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2006, the Sixers replaced the blue alternates with a red one, bringing back the \"PHILA\" logo for the first time since 1971. As with the other uniforms, the \"PHILA\" wordmark was shaped similarly to the team logo, with the silver star atop the \"I\". White numbers with black trim were placed on this uniform, along with a silver star on the neckline and blue and white striping. The next season saw some minor tweaks to the black and white uniforms, which now featured the same striping patterns as the red alternate along with the silver star.[94][102]\n\n\n\n### 2009–2015[edit]\n\n\nDuring the 2008–09 season, while the previous logo was still in use, the 1977–97 Sixers logo was revived to coincide with the team's 60th anniversary (counting the Syracuse years). After that, the team decided to bring back a modern version of said logo, with the addition of a red square and 'Philadelphia' inside a blue rectangle below it, although the partial logo without the square, city name and rectangles was also used.[103]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFor their first four years in Philadelphia, the 76ers played mostly at the Philadelphia Arena and Civic Center-Convention Hall, with an occasional game at The Palestra at the University of Pennsylvania. Schayes was named head coach, a post he held for four years (the first as player-coach).\n\n\n\n### 1964–1967: Wilt Chamberlain era[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Historical Look at the Sixers\" (PDF). *2023–24 Philadelphia 76ers Media Guide* (PDF).

The Sixers' edition featured a navy blue base and red lettering taken from the 1972–77 uniforms. Red, orange, green and blue blocks on each side paid tribute to the team's former home, the Spectrum, and also represented fan support for each of Philadelphia's \"Big Four\" teams (red representing the Phillies, orange representing the Flyers, green representing the Eagles, and blue representing the 76ers). The Spectrum center court logo, featuring the arena silhouette at the center, adorned the shorts, and the \"S\" from that logo was placed on the waist.[118]\n\n\nThe 2022–23 \"City\" uniform centered around Philadelphia's Greek translation of the \"City of Brotherly Love\", which was inscribed in front of the uniform. The mostly minimalist style uniform has a white base, red text and striping, and blue trim, and was inspired by the city's love of basketball in all levels.[119]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Apollo Global Management co-founder Josh Harris led an investment group that purchased the team for $280 million in 2011.\nFor the season, the Sixers had their best start since 2000–01 with a 20–9 record, battling for the Eastern Conference's best record and taking a firm division lead. They finished the rest of the season 15–22, giving them a 35–31 record. Attributed to their lack of a true go-to scorer,[*citation needed*] the 76ers lost hold of the top-three seed and division championship that they held for most of the season, by going on the losing streak. Nevertheless, they clinched their fourth playoff berth in the last five years on the penultimate play date of the season.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLed by Erving, the 76ers began an exciting ride, beating their long-time rival from Boston in a seven-game playoff series to advance to the Eastern Conference Finals. There, they defeated the Houston Rockets, led by future 76er Moses Malone, in six games to advance to the NBA Finals. In the Finals, they sprinted to a 2–0 series lead over the Bill Walton-led Portland Trail Blazers—who were coached by former 76ers' coach/general manager Jack Ramsay—only to drop the next four games in a row to give the Blazers the title.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Ed Snider purchased the 76ers in 1996.\nStarting with the 1990–91 season, and ending with the 1995–96 season, the 76ers had the dubious distinction of seeing their win total decrease each year. The nadir was the 1995–96 season, when they finished with an 18–64 record, the second-worst in franchise history at the time. It was also the second-worst record in the league that year, ahead of only the expansion Vancouver Grizzlies but behind the Toronto Raptors, who were also in their inaugural season. That season would turn out to be their last in The Spectrum. Katz, unpopular among fans since the 1986 trades, sold the team to Comcast Spectacor, a consortium of Philadelphia Flyers owner Ed Snider and Comcast Corporation, at the end of the 1995–96 season. Snider had been the 76ers' landlord since gaining control of the Spectrum in 1971. Pat Croce, a former trainer for the Flyers and Sixers, took over as president.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n128. **^** Coon, Larry. \"NBA Salary Cap FAQ – 2011 Collective Bargaining Agreement\".

The Sixers struggled heavily after that, at one point posting a 26-game losing streak which set a franchise record,[59] and tied the all-time NBA record for most consecutive losses in a single-season.[60] The Sixers finished the season with a 19–63 record, the third-worst in franchise history. Despite that, the Sixers did not have the worst win–loss record in the overall NBA standings: the Milwaukee Bucks finished worse with a 15–67 record.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn June 16, 1986, Katz made two of the most controversial and highly criticized personnel moves in franchise history, trading Moses Malone to Washington and the first overall pick in the 1986 NBA draft (which had been obtained from the San Diego Clippers in a 1979 trade for Joe Bryant) to the Cleveland Cavaliers. In return, the 76ers received Roy Hinson, Jeff Ruland, and Cliff Robinson, none of whom played more than three seasons with the team. Cleveland, meanwhile, turned their acquired pick into future All-Star Brad Daugherty.\n\n\nOn the night of the 1986–87 season opener, Julius Erving announced he would retire after the season, which was subsequently filled with tributes in each arena the Sixers visited. On the court, the team suffered through an injury-plagued campaign, but still managed to make the playoffs with a 45–37 record. Their season would end at the hands of the Bucks again, this time in a best-of-five first-round series that went the distance.\n\n\n\n### 1987–1992: Charles Barkley era[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 1971–72 season saw the Sixers return to wearing blue uniforms on the road. After sporting \"PHILA\" on the chest for eight seasons, the uniform now read \"Sixers\" in Art Deco style lettering, rendered in white on the road and red at home. Numbers were either white or blue with red trim. Contrasting side stripes were added and extended through the uniform, and either red or white stars were placed on each side. Prior to the 1976–77 season, the Sixers tweaked the uniform, now sporting a block \"Sixers\" wordmark and rounded numbers. The following season, the \"Sixers\" wordmark was changed to Bookman Old Style; on both iterations, \"Sixers\" became blue with red trim on the white uniform, with an additional outline on the latter.[94][98]\n\n\n\n### 1978–1997[edit]\n\n\nIn 1977, the Sixers logo was tweaked to include a white basketball with blue outlines and the suffix \"-ers\" in blue, completing the team nickname.

This time, they played angry but inspired basketball, pulling away to a 120–106 victory and becoming the third NBA road team to win Game 7 after leading the series 3–1. In the game's closing moments, the Boston Garden fans began chanting \"Beat L.A., Beat L.A.\", as they realized their team would lose the playoff series to a hated opponent (Philadelphia 76ers), but nonetheless openly wished that opponent good luck in the next round against a more hated opponent (the Los Angeles Lakers).[22] The team lost the 1982 Finals in six games against the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\n\n\n#### 1982–83: Third NBA championship[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe next year, the 76ers would hire Gene Shue as their head coach and they slowly came back. In the 1975–76 season, the 76ers acquired George McGinnis from the Indiana Pacers of the ABA (after the Knicks tried to sign him, not knowing that the 76ers owned his rights). With him, the 76ers were back in the playoffs after a five-year absence, and even though they lost to the Buffalo Braves in three games, a doctor would come along and get the team healthy enough to stay in perennial contention. During this period, one last personnel misjudgment had effects when the team used the fifth pick overall in the 1975 draft to select Darryl Dawkins directly from high school. The immensely talented and physically imposing Dawkins seldom, if ever, lived up to his great potential in part because of a perpetual adolescence.\n\n\n\n### 1976–1987: Julius Erving era[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSeveral teams began to leave the NBL for the BAA as the foundation for a merger was laid. The Nationals \"recipe for success\" began by recruiting Leo Ferris.[9] Staying in the NBL, Ferris signed Al Cervi to be player-coach and outbid the New York Knicks for the services of Dolph Schayes who made his professional debut,[10] leading the Nationals to a winning record for the first time with a record of 40–23. In the playoffs the Nationals defeated the Hammond Calumet Buccaneers, winning the series in two straight games. In the semifinals, the Nationals lost to the Anderson Duffey Packers for the second straight season in four games. In 1949, when the NBL and the BAA merged into the NBA, the Nationals were one of seven NBL teams that were brought into the NBA.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## Esports ventures[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2016, the 76ers acquired both Team Dignitas and Apex Gaming and merged them under the Dignitas brand, becoming the first North American professional sports team to own an esports team.[136]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* South Philadelphia Sports Complex\n* Sports in Philadelphia\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** As managing partners.

In 1989–90, Barkley finished second in the league's MVP voting, as the Sixers won the Atlantic Division title with a 53–29 record. After defeating Cleveland in the first round of the playoffs, Philadelphia faced Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls in the second round. The 76ers fell to the Chicago Bulls in five games, and would do the same in 1991 after sweeping the Bucks in the first round. In the 1991–92 season, the 76ers went 35–47 and missed the playoffs for just the second time during Barkley's eight seasons in Philadelphia. On June 17, 1992, Barkley was traded to the Phoenix Suns for Jeff Hornacek, Tim Perry, and Andrew Lang, a deal that was met with harsh criticism.[25]\n\n\n\n### 1992–1996: Dark ages[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the 1967–68 season, with a new home court in the form of The Spectrum to defend their championship, once again the 76ers made it back to the NBA Playoffs and in the rematch of the previous year's semifinals, the 76ers held a 3–1 series lead over the Celtics, before the Celtics staged a dramatic comeback to beat the Sixers in seven games.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 76ers went into the 2001–02 season with high expectations, but were able to produce only a 43–39 record, sixth in the Eastern Conference. In the first round of the playoffs, Philadelphia was defeated 3–2 by the Boston Celtics. In the 2002–03 season, the 76ers sprinted to a 15–4 start, but a 10–20 swoon left them 25–24 at the All-Star break. After the break, the 76ers caught fire, winning nine in a row at one point, and 23 of their last 33 to finish at 48–34, earning the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs. Iverson scored 55 points in the playoff opener against the New Orleans Hornets and the Sixers went on to win the series in six games. In the second round, the Detroit Pistons ended Philadelphia's playoff run in a frustrating six-game series that saw the 76ers lose twice in overtime, and once on a last-second shot in regulation. It would be nine years before the Sixers won another playoff series.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDuring the 2000–01 season, the 76ers got off to a hot start by winning their first ten games and were never seriously challenged in the Atlantic Division. Larry Brown coached the Eastern Conference All-Stars, and Allen Iverson was named MVP of the All-Star Game. Shortly before the All-Star break, Theo Ratliff was lost for the season with a wrist injury, one that would later prove to be devastating to his future career. Despite holding a 41–14 record and a comfortable lead atop both the Atlantic Division and Eastern Conference standings at the time of the February 22 trade deadline, management felt the team needed an established center to advance deep into the playoffs. On that day, Philadelphia acquired Dikembe Mutombo from the Atlanta Hawks in a deal that sent the injured Ratliff along with Nazr Mohammed, Toni Kukoč, and Pepe Sánchez to Atlanta (Sánchez was reacquired later in the season after the Hawks waived him). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 2017–18 season was the most successful season since the 2011–12 season as the team finished the regular season in third place in the Eastern Conference with a 52–30 winning record and clinched a playoff spot.[75] The season also saw the 76ers reaching a franchise-record 16-game winning streak.[76] In the First Round of the playoffs, the Sixers defeated the Heat in five games, to win their first playoff series since the 2011–12 season.\n\n\nFollowing a controversy involving fake Twitter accounts, the 76ers parted ways with general manager Bryan Colangelo on June 7, 2018.[77] The team promoted Elton Brand from executive vice president of basketball operations to fill the vacant general manager role on September 18, 2018.[78]\n\n\nOn November 12, 2018, the 76ers traded Šarić, Robert Covington, Jerryd Bayless and a 2022 second-round draft pick to the Minnesota Timberwolves in exchange for Jimmy Butler and Justin Patton.[79]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain article: Philadelphia 76ers accomplishments and records\n\n### Retired numbers[edit]\n\n\nAll of the 76ers' retired numbers are hanging on the rafters in the Wells Fargo Center\n\n\n\n![](image)Former 76ers public address announcer Dave Zinkoff\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n104. **^** \"Philadelphia 76ers Unveil New Team Uniforms for 2009-10 Season\". *Sixers.com* (Press release).

Side stripes were eliminated and the team logo was emblazoned on the right leg. The road uniform color was changed back to red (with the lettering scheme similar to the 1968–70 red uniforms), and the numbers revert to a block letter style.[94][99]\n\n\nBefore the 1991–92 season, the Sixers experimented with a more radical uniform design. The front featured a blue wave with red, white and blue stars, and \"Sixers\" in Helvetica was affixed above the blue wave. The full city name \"Philadelphia\" was also added above the team name.

They clinched a playoff berth on April 1, 2011, their third in the last four years. The 76ers faced the heavily favored Heat in the first round, and ultimately fell to them in five games. Although they lost the series, Collins was praised for turning around a lottery team in his first season, as well as winning a playoff game when many pundits predicted that the Sixers would be swept. Collins also finished second in Coach of the Year voting.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDespite several teams leaving the NBA for the National Professional Basketball League before the 1950–51 season, the Nationals decided to stay put. In their second NBA season, 1950–51, the Nationals played mediocre basketball all season, finishing in fourth place with a record of 32–34. In the playoffs the Nationals played their best basketball of the season as they stunned the first-place Warriors in two straight, taking Game 1 on the road in overtime 91–89. In the Eastern Finals, the Nationals were beaten by the New York Knickerbockers in a hard-fought five-game series, losing the finale by just two points.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe 76ers went on to finish 56–26, good enough for their first Atlantic Division title since 1989–90 and top seed in the Eastern Conference Playoffs.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Jerry Colangelo joined the team's front office in 2015.\nOn May 19, the 76ers were awarded the third overall pick in the 2015 NBA draft, where they selected Duke center Jahlil Okafor with the third overall pick. The 76ers also signed JP Tokoto with the 58th overall pick. On November 27, the 76ers lost to the Houston Rockets 116–114, giving them a 27-game losing streak dating back to the previous season, which became the longest losing streak in professional sports. During the same game, the Sixers set a franchise record of 16 three pointers made during the losing effort. On December 1, the 76ers beat the Lakers at home by a score of 103–91, but not before setting a league record 28 consecutive losses dating to the 2014–15 season. In doing so, the 76ers also managed to avoid setting a new NBA record of most losses to begin a season. They instead tied the old record of 18 losses set by the then-New Jersey Nets in the 2009–10 season.[67]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Sixers' \"City\" uniform for the 2019–20 season paid homage to the Liberty Bell, featuring an ornate \"Philadelphia\" wordmark and red serifed numbers. The gold bell silhouette is prominently featured on the beltline.[115] The 2020–21 \"City\" uniform paid homage to the Allen Iverson era and the Boathouse Row landmark, featuring a black base with red, blue and white accents. The Boathouse Row illustration is drawn in white above \"Philadelphia\" in white with blue drop shadows. The numbers, also in white with blue drop shadows, are placed on the left chest.[116]\n\n\nThe Sixers' \"Earned\" uniform for 2021 (after qualifying in the 2020 playoffs) featured a blue silhouette of the Liberty Bell on a white background, with white numbers placed in the middle.[117]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe white uniform featured \"Sixers\" in blue and numbers in red, both returning to a block letter style. The red uniform contained both the \"Sixers\" and the uniform number in white. In 2011, a blue alternate uniform was introduced, mirroring that of the red uniform. After 2013, the blue uniform became the primary road set. All three designs employed a more subtle striping along the arms and legs.[104][102]\n\n\n\n### 2015–present[edit]\n\n\nA new version of the classic 76ers logo was unveiled for the 2015–16 season, featuring a slight tilt to the white basketball and a roundel featuring the city name and six stars. A secondary \"Dribbling Ben Franklin\" logo was also introduced.[105]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe switch to Nike in 2017 saw the Sixers make some slight tweaks to their uniform set. The blue \"Icon\" uniform and the white \"Association\" uniform now feature a red drop shadow on the lettering, and the inscription 'Brotherly Love' replaced 'PHILA TOUGH' near the manufacturer's tag.[107][108] The Sixers also released their new red \"Statement\" uniform, featuring a script \"Sixers\" wordmark, off-centered numbers and blue drop shadows.[109] Prior to the 2019–20 season the red uniforms were tweaked to feature a script \"Phila\" wordmark.[110]\n\n\nOn May 16, 2023, the 76ers president of basketball operations, Daryl Morey, announced that Doc Rivers would be dismissed from his position as head coach after three seasons, stating that \"We're grateful for all he did in his three seasons here and thank him for the important impact he made on our franchise. After having the chance to reflect upon our season, we decided that certain changes are necessary to further our goals of competing for a championship.\"[111]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe home white, away blue and red alternate uniforms featured a mix of classic styles used in previous uniforms. The home white and away blue uniforms featured the 'PHILA' wordmark as homage to the late 1960s uniforms, while the red alternates featured the 'SIXERS' wordmark in tribute to the 1980s uniforms. Side stripes featuring seven stars on one side and six on the other pay homage to the 1970s uniforms, while the shoulder piping was a callback to the 1980s uniforms. The inscription 'PHILA TOUGH' is sewed on the bottom of all uniforms.[106]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith the Lakers relocating from Minneapolis to Los Angeles before the 1960–61 season, the Syracuse Nationals became the last old NBL team to still be playing in their original city in the NBA. The Nationals went on to make the playoffs again by finishing in third place with a 38–41 record. The Nationals were dangerous in the playoffs as they stunned the Warriors in three straight games. In the Eastern Finals, the Nationals lost once again to the eventual champion Celtics in five games.\n\n\nSchayes missed 24 games during the 1961–62 season and failed to lead the team in scoring for the first time in 14 years, as Hal Greer led the way with 22.8 points per game. The Nationals finished in third place again with a 41–39 record. In the playoffs, the Nationals lost their first two games to the Warriors on the road. Facing elimination the Nationals won the next two games to force a fifth game in Philadelphia. In Game 5 the Warriors ended the Nationals' season with a 121–104 victory.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n51. **^** \"Spencer Hawes, Jrue Holiday lift 76ers past Trail Blazers\". *ESPN.com*.

In Game One, the 76ers wasted an 18-point lead and lost, 79–78, when Reggie Miller hit a three-pointer in the closing seconds. Philadelphia fought back and won the next three games to win the series. In the Eastern Conference Semifinals, the Sixers squared off against the Toronto Raptors and their superstar, Vince Carter. The teams alternated wins in the first four games, with Iverson scoring 54 points in Philadelphia's Game Two victory. A Game Five win (with Iverson scoring 52 in a 121–88 rout) and Game Six loss set up a decisive Game Seven, which the 76ers survived as Carter missed a long jump shot at the buzzer for an 88–87 victory that sent the Sixers to the Eastern Conference Finals against the Milwaukee Bucks. After the teams split the first two games of the series in Philadelphia, it was learned Iverson would miss Game Three due to various nagging injuries that had plagued him late in the season. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Under Seymour, the Nationals rebounded and finished the 1956–57 season in second place with a record of 38–34. In the playoffs, the Nationals had trouble knocking off the defending champion Warriors advancing to the Eastern Finals with two straight wins. The Nationals were swept in three games by the eventual champions, the Celtics.\n\n\nFort Wayne and Rochester had moved on to Detroit and Cincinnati for the 1957–58 season, leaving the Syracuse Nationals as the last small-town team in the big city NBA. That did not matter on the court as the Nationals held their own finishing in second place with a 41–31 record. In the playoffs, the Nationals fell in the first round as they lost a three-game series to the Philadelphia Warriors.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Sixers unveiled a cleaner design for the 1966–67 season, with \"PHILA\" in red block letters and trimmed in either white or blue. \"PHILA\" was also moved back above the number. The logo and stars were removed in favor of simple side stripes. Initially, the Sixers wore blue uniforms on the road, but in 1968, they changed back to red uniforms with \"PHILA\" in white with blue trim.[94][96]\n\n\nFor the 1970–71 season, the Sixers tinkered with their red uniforms, switching the color scheme on the letters to blue with white trim. Meanwhile, the white uniform received a more radical makeover, featuring the full name \"Seventy Sixers\" in red cursive lettering with blue trim. This set lasted for only one season.[94][96][97]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn June 23, 2016, following the 2015–16 season, and after the 76ers were awarded the first overall pick in the 2016 draft, the team selected LSU Point Forward Ben Simmons first overall. The Sixers also selected French basketball player Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot and Turkish basketball player Furkan Korkmaz with the 24th and 26th picks in the 2016 NBA draft respectively.[72] Many consider the 2016 NBA Draft a turning point for the 76ers after their three seasons of not being competitive resulted in the franchise garnering the first overall pick, the first time the team owned the first since 1996 when the 76ers selected point guard Allen Iverson first overall.[73] The Sixers subsequently traded for another number one pick in the 2017 NBA draft, choosing Markelle Fultz.[74]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDespite a mediocre 35–37 record for the 1958–59 season the Nationals made the playoffs again by finishing in third place. In the playoffs, the Nationals swept the Knickerbockers in two straight to reach the Eastern Finals, where they lost to the eventual champion Celtics, alternating wins before losing by 5 points in Game 7.\n\n\nPlaying in a league now dominated by superstars like Bill Russell of the Celtics, Wilt Chamberlain of the Warriors, Bob Pettit of the St. Louis Hawks and Elgin Baylor of the Lakers, the Nationals held their own posting a solid 45–30 record, while finishing in third place after the 1959–60 regular season. In the playoffs, the Nationals lost a three-game series to Chamberlain and the Warriors.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCervi, playing less and coaching more, emphasized a patient offense and a scrappy defense, which led the league in the 1951–52 season by yielding a stingy 79.5 points per game as the Nationals won the Eastern Division with a solid 40–26 record. In the playoffs, the Nationals knocked off the Warriors again in a three-game series. In the Eastern Finals, the Nationals fell to the Knickerbockers again, dropping the series in four games.\n\n\nThe Nationals finished in second place in a hard-fought 3-way battle for first place in the Eastern Division for the 1952–53 season, with a record of 47–24. In the playoffs, the Nationals faced the Boston Celtics dropping Game 1 at home 87–81. Needing a win in Boston to keep their hopes alive, the Nationals took the Celtics deep into overtime before losing in quadruple OT 111–105, in what remains the longest playoff game in NBA history.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 2007, the Sixers drafted small forward Thaddeus Young with the 12th pick. On December 4, 2007, the Sixers fired King and replaced him with Nets' general manager Ed Stefanski.[27]\n\n\nWith Iguodala, the Sixers clinched a playoff berth with a win over the Atlanta Hawks on April 4, 2008. It was their first postseason appearance since 2005, as well as the first in the post-Iverson era. They were eliminated by the Pistons in six games, with Detroit winning the series 4–2. Even with this elimination, many fans considered this to be a successful season, considering that the Sixers were 12 games under .500 in early February and went on make the playoffs and a 40–42 record.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* National Constitution Center\n* National Liberty Museum\n* National Museum of American Jewish History\n* Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts\n* Philadelphia History Museum\n* Philadelphia Museum of Art\n* Philadelphia's Magic Gardens\n* Please Touch Museum\n* Powel House\n* RittenhouseTown\n* Rodin Museum\n* Rosenbach Museum and Library\n* Ryerss Museum and Library\n* Science History Institute\n* Shofuso Japanese House and Garden\n* Stenton\n* Thaddeus Kosciuszko National Memorial\n* Penn Museum\n* Wagner Free Institute of Science\n* Woodmere Art Museum\n* Wyck House\n |\n| Sports | * 76ers\n* Eagles\n* Flyers\n* Freedoms\n* Phillies\n* Union\n |\n| Squares | * Centre\n* Franklin\n* Logan\n* Rittenhouse\n* Washington\n |\n| Related | * Delaware Valley\n* Carpenters' Hall\n* Independence Hall\n* Congress Hall\n* Liberty Bell\n* Syng inkstand\n* SS *United States*\n* 2016 Democratic National Convention\n |\n| * ![](image) Category\n* ![](image) Portal\n |\n |\n\nPortals:* ![icon](image) Basketball\n* ![](image) Philadelphia\n* ![flag](image) Pennsylvania\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 2007, NBA historian Kyle Wright argued that the 1992–93 Dallas Mavericks and 1997–98 Denver Nuggets, both of whom won eleven games, plus the inaugural Cleveland Cavaliers, who won 15 games, were actually poorer teams due to much weaker schedules.[20]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Seattle SuperSonics–Oklahoma City Thunder (2008)\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNational Basketball Association\n |\n| --- |\n| EasternConference | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Atlantic | Boston Celtics\nBrooklyn Nets\nNew York Knicks\nPhiladelphia 76ers\nToronto Raptors\n |\n| Central | Chicago Bulls\nCleveland Cavaliers\nDetroit Pistons\nIndiana Pacers\nMilwaukee Bucks\n |\n| Southeast | Atlanta Hawks\nCharlotte Hornets\nMiami Heat\nOrlando Magic\nWashington Wizards\n |\n\n |\n| WesternConference | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Northwest | Denver Nuggets\nMinnesota Timberwolves\nOklahoma City Thunder\nPortland Trail Blazers\nUtah Jazz\n |\n| Pacific | Golden State Warriors\nLos Angeles Clippers\nLos Angeles Lakers\nPhoenix Suns\nSacramento Kings\n |\n| Southwest | Dallas Mavericks\nHouston Rockets\nMemphis Grizzlies\nNew Orleans Pelicans\nSan Antonio Spurs\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Nationals acquired Alex Groza, and Ralph Beard as the Indianapolis Olympians folded leaving the NBA with just 9 teams for the 1953–54 season. Once again the Nationals battled for the Division title falling two games short with a 42–30 record. In the playoffs, the Nationals won all four games of a round-robin tournament involving the three playoff teams from the East. In the Eastern Finals, the Nationals beat the Celtics in two straight games. In the NBA Finals, the Nationals lost to the Lakers in a hard-fought seven-game series where the two teams alternated wins throughout.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThough in the 2004–05 season the 76ers exceeded many on-court expectations, there was a great deal of behind-the-scenes tension between O'Brien, his players, and the front office. Shortly after the season ended, O'Brien was fired and replaced by the popular Maurice Cheeks, who played for the team from 1978 to 1989, and was the starting point guard for the 1983 NBA Champions. The coaching change did not help the team's fortunes for the 2005–06 season. A 2–10 stretch in March doomed them to missing the playoffs for the second time in three years with a 38–44 record.\n\n\nWith the opening of the 2006–07 season, the 76ers started out hot, going 3–0 for the first time since making it to the Finals five years previously. They stumbled through the first half of the season and did not recover, finishing 35–47, good for third in the Atlantic Division, and ninth in the Eastern Conference (tied with Indiana).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nRubin was fired after 51 games and a 4-47 record; as it turned out, it would be his only NBA coaching job. He was succeeded by player-coach Kevin Loughery, who went 5–26 the rest of the way. The 76ers finished an NBA-record 59 games behind the Atlantic Division champion Boston Celtics. Only six years after tallying the most wins in NBA history, the 1972–73 squad notched the fourth-fewest wins in NBA history, and still the fewest for a full 82-game season. The 73 losses, although threatened several times, remains the all-time low-water mark for any NBA franchise. The 76ers' 0.110 winning percentage was a record worst at the time, and would remain the lowest until the 2011–12 Charlotte Bobcats finished 7–59 for a .106 winning percentage in a season shortened due to a lockout. The 76ers of 1972–73 are generally considered to be the worst team ever to take the court in NBA history. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHershey FC\nPennsylvania Classics AC\nPittsburgh Hotspurs\nUWS\nLancaster Inferno FC\nUWS2\nErie Commodores FC\n |\n| Indoor soccer | MASL\nHarrisburg Heat\n |\n| Softball |  |\n| Tennis | WTT\nPhiladelphia Freedoms\n |\n| Ultimate | AUDL\nPhiladelphia Phoenix\nPittsburgh Thunderbirds\n |\n| College athletics(NCAA Division I) | Bucknell Bison\nDrexel Dragons\nDuquesne Dukes\nLa Salle Explorers\nLafayette Leopards\nLehigh Mountain Hawks\n*Mercyhurst Lakers (Division I in July 2024)*\nPenn Quakers\nPenn State Nittany Lions\nPittsburgh Panthers\nRobert Morris Colonials\nSaint Francis Red Flash\nSaint Joseph's Hawks\nTemple Owls\nVillanova Wildcats\n |\n| * Sports in Pennsylvania\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith an aging team, the Nationals were expected to fade; however, with the scrappy play of Johnny Kerr, the Nationals remained a strong contender, finishing in second place for the 1962–63 season, with a record of 48–32.

Needing one win to advance to the Eastern Finals again the Nationals lost two straight, dropping the decisive fifth game at home in overtime 131–127.\n\n\n\n### Relocation to Philadelphia[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFollowing the suspension of the 2019–20 NBA season, the 76ers were one of the 22 teams invited to the NBA Bubble to participate in the final eight games of the regular season.[82] The Sixers started the bubble in the sixth seed, tied with the Pacers, who had the tiebreaker. The regular season finished with the 76ers in the sixth seed, a notable decrease in position from the previous two seasons. In the first round of the playoffs, the 76ers were eliminated by the Celtics in a 4–0 sweep. Head coach Brett Brown was fired on August 24, 2020.\n\n\n\n#### 2020–present: Morey era[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the finals the Nationals would get off to a fast start, led by forward Schayes, taking the first two games at home against the Fort Wayne Pistons.[12] As the series moved to Fort Wayne the Pistons would spark back to life taking all three games to take a 3–2 series lead. Back in Syracuse for Game 6 on the Nationals kept Championship hopes alive by beating the Pistons 109–104 to force a seventh game at home. Game 7 would be as tight as the series as George King sank a free throw to give the Nationals a 92–91 lead in the final seconds. King then stole the inbound pass to clinch the NBA Championship for the Nationals.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n59. **^** \"Pacers send Sixers to team-record 21st straight loss\". *philly-archives*.

The design contained thick blue stripes within either thin red or white stripes, and the letters were changed to a more classic rounded style. Numbers were now rendered in blue on both uniforms with either white or red trim, and the white uniform again featured \"Sixers\" in red letters with white and blue trim.[94][101]\n\n\n\n### 1997–2009[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1997–98 season, the Sixers drastically changed their logo and colors in an effort to appeal to the more youthful hip-hop-oriented culture. Red, white and blue were retained, but only as trim colors. Instead, the Sixers used black, silver and gold as its core colors, with the logo now featuring 76ers in gold, a single silver star within the 7, and a streaking basketball below the logo.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Andre Iguodala was drafted by the 76ers in 2004\nFor the 2004–05 season, Philadelphia native Jim O'Brien was named head coach. Iverson was moved back to point guard and flourished, having arguably his finest season. He also impressed many with his willingness to get other players involved in the offense. During this season, Philadelphia acquired Chris Webber in a trade with the Sacramento Kings, with the hopes that the team had at long last found a consistent second scoring option to complement Iverson. Andre Iguodala, Philadelphia's first-round pick in the 2004 NBA draft, was named to the All-Rookie First Team, and the 76ers returned to the postseason with a 43–39 record. In the first round, they were defeated in five games by the defending NBA Champion Pistons, coached by Larry Brown.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter a disappointing 1983–84 season, which ended with a five-game loss to the upstart New Jersey Nets in the first round of the playoffs, Charles Barkley arrived in Philadelphia for the 1984–85 season. For the next eight seasons, Barkley brought delight to the Philadelphia fans thanks to his humorous and sometimes controversial ways.[24] The Sixers returned to the Eastern Conference Finals in Barkley's rookie season, but lost to the Boston Celtics in five games. As it turned out, they would never again advance as far during Barkley's tenure in Philadelphia. Following the 1984–85 season, Matt Guokas replaced Billy Cunningham as head coach. Guokas led the 76ers to a 54–28 record and the second round of the 1986 playoffs, where they were defeated by the Milwaukee Bucks in seven games.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_DHrzxsOxMsIRtIF4j3aLC82F","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Wray became the Eagles' first head coach after being persuaded to assume the position by Bell, his former teammate at Penn. The Eagles originally intended to play their home games at Shibe Park, which was the home of the Philadelphia Athletics professional baseball in Philadelphia. When negotiations for use of Shibe Park fell through, however, the Eagles struck a deal with the Athletics' crosstown rival, the Philadelphia Phillies, to begin playing at the Baker Bowl.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Links to related articles\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preceded byChicago Cardinals\n |  **NFL champions** 1948, 1949 | Succeeded byCleveland Browns\n |\n| Preceded byBaltimore Colts\n |  **NFL champions** 1960 | Succeeded byGreen Bay Packers\n |\n| Preceded byNew England Patriots\n |  **Super Bowl champions** 2017 (LII) | Succeeded byNew England Patriots\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1935, Bell proposed an annual college draft to equalize talent across the league. The draft was a revolutionary concept in professional sports. Having teams select players in inverse order of their finish in the standings, a practice still followed today, strove to increase fan interest by guaranteeing that even the worst teams would have the opportunity for annual infusions of the best college talent.[17] Between 1927, when the NFL changed from a sprawling Midwestern-based association to a narrower, major-market league, and 1934, three teams, the Chicago Bears, New York Giants, and Green Bay Packers, won all but one title with the exception of the Providence Steam Roller, which won in 1928. By 1936, the Eagles suffered significant financial losses and were sold through a public auction. Bert Bell was the only bidder and became the sole owner of the team. Wray refused a reduction in his salary and left the team. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the early 1920s, the Frankford Athletic Association's Yellow Jackets gained the reputation as being one of the best independent football teams in the nation. In 1922, Frankford absorbed the Philadelphia City Champion team, the Union Quakers of Philadelphia. That year, Frankford captured the unofficial championship of Philadelphia. During the 1922 and 1923 seasons, the Yellow Jackets compiled a 6–2–1 record against teams from the National Football League. This led to the Association being granted an NFL franchise in 1924, thus becoming the Frankford Yellow Jackets. In spite of winning the NFL championship in 1926, midway through the 1931 season, the Yellow Jackets went bankrupt and were forced to cease operations.[14]\n\n\n\n### Bell and Wray era (1933–1940)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Bert Bell and Lud Wray\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPrior to the start of the 1949 season, the Eagles were sold by Thompson to a syndicate of 100 buyers, known as the \"Happy Hundred\", each of whom paid $3,000 for a share of the team. While the leader of the \"Happy Hundred\" was noted Philadelphia businessman James P. Clark, one unsung investor was Leonard Tose.[28]\n\n\n\n##### NFL champions (1949)[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: 1949 NFL Championship Game\n\nIn 1949, the Eagles returned to the NFL Championship game for a third consecutive year. The Eagles were favored by a touchdown,[29][30][31] and won 14–0 for their second consecutive title game shutout. Running back Steve Van Buren rushed for 196 yards on 31 carries for the Eagles, and their defense held the Rams to just 21 yards on the ground.[32] Chuck Bednarik was selected as the first overall pick in the 1949 NFL Draft. An All-American lineman/linebacker from the University of Pennsylvania, Bednarik would go on to become one of the greatest and most beloved players in Eagles history.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Eagles played their first game on October 15, 1933, against the New York Giants at the Polo Grounds in New York City, and lost the game 56–0.[16] The Eagles struggled over the course of their first decade, never winning more than four games in any of their first ten seasons. Their best finish was in 1934, the second season for the Eagles, when they tied for third in the East. The Eagles' early rosters largely consisted of former Penn, Temple, and Villanova players who played for the Eagles for a few years before going on to other things.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1943, with player shortages stemming from the U.S. entry engagement in World War II, it became difficult to fill the roster, and the team merged with the Steelers to form the \"Phil-Pitt Eagles\", known as the Steagles. Greasy Neale continued to coach the team along with Steelers head coach Walt Kiesling. The team finished the 1943 season with a 5–4–1 record, and the merger, which was never intended to be a permanent arrangement, was dissolved at the season's end.\n\n\nIn 1944, the Eagles, led by head coach Greasy Neale and running back Steve Van Buren, had their first winning season in team history. After two second-place finishes in 1945 and 1946, the team reached the NFL Championship game for the first time in 1947. Van Buren, Pete Pihos, and Bosh Pritchard fought valiantly, but the young team lost to the Chicago Cardinals, 28–21 at Comiskey Park in Chicago.\n\n\n\n##### NFL champions (1948)[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: 1948 NFL Championship Game and 1948 Philadelphia Eagles season\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Eagles were a part of the NFL Eastern Division from 1933 to 1949, the National Conference from 1950 to 1953, and the Eastern Conference from 1953 to 1966. They were then placed in the Capitol Division of the Eastern Conference in 1967. When the league reformed into the NFC and AFC in 1970, the Eagles were placed in the NFC East. \n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Coach\n | Record\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1947 | Greasy Neale | 8–4\n |\n| 1948 | 11–5\n |\n| 1949 | 11–5\n |\n| 1960 | Buck Shaw | 10–2\n |\n| 1980 | Dick Vermeil | 12–4\n |\n| 1988 | Buddy Ryan | 10–6\n |\n| 2001 | Andy Reid | 11–5\n |\n| 2002 | 12–4\n |\n| 2003 | 12–4\n |\n| 2004 | 13–3\n |\n| 2006 | 10–6\n |\n| 2010 | 10–6\n |\n| 2013 | Chip Kelly | 10–6\n |\n| 2017 | Doug Pederson | 13–3\n |\n| 2019 | 9–7\n |\n| 2022 | Nick Sirianni | 14–3\n |\n| **Total Division Championships won: 16** |\n\n\n## Logo and uniforms[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Protective equipment in gridiron football and National Football League uniform numbers\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Season\n | Coach\n | Super Bowl\n | Location\n | Opponent\n | Score\n | Record\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2017 | Doug Pederson | LII | U.S. Bank Stadium (Minneapolis) | New England Patriots | 41–33 | 13–3\n |\n| **Total Super Bowls won: 1** |  |\n\n\n### NFC championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Season\n | Coach\n | Location\n | Opponent\n | Score\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1980 | Dick Vermeil | Veterans Stadium (Philadelphia) | Dallas Cowboys | 20–7\n |\n| 2004 | Andy Reid | Lincoln Financial Field (Philadelphia) | Atlanta Falcons | 27–10\n |\n| 2017 | Doug Pederson | Lincoln Financial Field (Philadelphia) | Minnesota Vikings | 38–7\n |\n| 2022 | Nick Sirianni | Lincoln Financial Field (Philadelphia) | San Francisco 49ers | 31–7\n |\n| **Total NFC Championships won: 4** |  |\n\n\n### Division championships[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Eastern Division (1933–1949)\n* American Conference (1950–1952)\n* Eastern Conference (1953–1969)\n\t+ Capitol Division (1967–1969)\n* **National Football Conference (1970–present)**\n\t+ **NFC East (1970–present)**\n |\n| **Current uniform**\n |\n| ![](image)\n |\n| Team colors | Midnight green, silver, black, white[3][4][5]        |\n| Fight song | \"Fly, Eagles Fly\" |\n| Mascot | Swoop |\n| Personnel |\n| Owner(s) | Jeffrey Lurie[6] |\n| CEO | Jeffrey Lurie |\n| President | Don Smolenski |\n| General manager | Howie Roseman |\n| Head coach | Nick Sirianni |\n| Team history |\n| * **Philadelphia Eagles (1933–1942, 1944–present)**\n* Phil-Pitt \"Steagles\" (1943)\n |\n| Team nicknames |\n| * **The Birds**\n* **The Iggles**\n |\n| Championships |\n| **League championships (4)*** **NFL championships (pre-1970 AFL–NFL merger) (3)**1948, 1949, 1960\n* **Super Bowl championships (1)**2017 (LII)\n |\n| **Conference championships (5)*** **NFL Eastern:** 1960\n* **NFC:** 1980, 2004, 2017, 2022\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe team's intense rivalry with the New York Giants has been ranked the top rivalry of all time by NFL Network, the fourth-best NFL rivalry by *Sports Illustrated*,[8] and one of the fiercest and best-known football rivalries by ESPN.[9] The Eagles' bitter rivalry with the Dallas Cowboys has become more high-profile and intense since the 1960s, and the team has a historic rivalry with the Washington Commanders.

Former Eagles owner and co-founder Bert Bell had become NFL commissioner, and attended the Eagles game on October 11 at Franklin Field against the Pittsburgh Steelers, a team Bell used to own.

Shaw, Van Brocklin, and Bednarik, each in their last season before retirement, led an Eagles team more notable for its grit than its talent. One observer later quipped that the team had \"nothing but a championship\" to its first division title since 1949. The team was aided by their two Pro Bowl receivers, wide receiver Tommy McDonald, who later wrote an autobiography titled *They Pay Me to Catch Footballs*, and tight end Pete Retzlaff.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Eagles and Pittsburgh Steelers are both located in Pennsylvania and began play in 1933. From that season through 1966, this was a major rivalry for both teams, as both were part of the same division. In 1967 they were placed in separate divisions, but remained in the same conference for three years. In 1970 the Steelers (along with the Cleveland Browns and Baltimore Colts) moved to the American Football Conference, while the Eagles stayed with the rest of the old-line NFL teams in the National Football Conference. As a result, the Eagles and Steelers no longer played each other every year; instead, they are scheduled to meet once every four years in the regular season. The most recent meeting was in 2022 at Lincoln Financial Field due to the addition of a regular season game based on opposing conference divisional finish from the season before, with the Eagles winning 35-13. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhile the remnants of the great 1940s teams managed to stay competitive for the first few years of the decade, and younger players like Bobby Walston and Sonny Jurgensen occasionally provided infusions of talent, the team lacked the total talent necessary for true greatness during most of the 1950s.\n\n\nAfter the 1957 season, the Eagles moved from Connie Mack Stadium to Franklin Field at the University of Pennsylvania. Franklin Field had a vastly expanded seating capacity for the Eagles. While Connie Mack Stadium had a capacity of 39,000, Franklin Field's capacity was 60,000.[33] In 1969, the grass field at Franklin Field was replaced by AstroTurf, making Franklin Field the first NFL stadium to use artificial turf.\n\n\n\n#### Buck Shaw years (1958–1960)[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: 1960 NFL Championship Game and Buck Shaw\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTo celebrate the team's 75th anniversary, the 2007 uniforms featured a 75th-season logo patch on the left shoulder. In addition, the team wore \"throwback\" jerseys in a 2007 game against the Detroit Lions. The yellow and blue jerseys, the same colors found on Philadelphia's city flag, are based on those worn by the Philadelphia Eagles in the team's inaugural season, and had been the same colors used by the Frankford Yellow Jackets franchise prior to its suspension of operations in 1931. The Eagles beat Detroit, 56–21.[126]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWhile not as big as the rivalries with the Giants and Cowboys, the Eagles' historical rivalry with the Washington Redskins and Washington Commanders has still been fierce. Although the two franchises played in the same division in the Eagles' inaugural 1933 season, their first meeting did not take place until October 21, 1934, during Washington's first year under the Boston Redskins moniker; the Redskins defeated the Eagles 6–0 at Fenway Park. Washington currently leads the all-time series 89–84–6. Since 2010, the rivalry has been very even overall with the Eagles winning 16 of the last 27 matchups.[135]\n\n\n\n### Pittsburgh Steelers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Eagles–Steelers rivalry\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Steve Van Buren, Eagles halfback from 1944 to 1951, was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1965.\n![](image)Chuck Bednarik, Eagles linebacker and center from 1949 to 1962, was inducted into Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1967.\n![](image)Pete Pihos, Eagles tight end from 1947 to 1955, was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1970.\nUndeterred, the young team rebounded in 1948 to return to the NFL Championship game. With home field advantage and a blinding snowstorm on their side, the Eagles won their first NFL Championship against the Chicago Cardinals by a score of 7–0. The only score came in the fourth quarter when Steve Van Buren ran for a five-yard touchdown. Because of the severe weather, few fans witnessed the joyous occasion.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n47. **^** \"Didinger: When the Eagles Almost Left Philly\".

The Bell–Wray group had to pay an entry fee of $3,500, or roughly $67,000 USD in inflation-adjusted 2022 dollars, and assumed a total debt of $11,000 the Yellow Jackets owed to three other NFL franchises.[15] Drawing inspiration from the Blue Eagle logo of the National Recovery Administration, a centerpiece of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal policies,[15] Bell and Wray named their new franchise the Philadelphia Eagles. While it could seem as if the Yellow Jackets simply rebranded as the Eagles, both the Eagles organization and NFL officially regard the teams as two separate entities. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Veterans Stadium in South Philadelphia, the Eagles' home field from 1971 to 2002, which they shared with baseball's Phillies\nIn 1969, Leonard Tose bought the team from Wolman for $16.155 million,[39] the equivalent of $134 million today, representing a record then for the highest amount ever paid for a professional sports franchise.

In 1954 the Eagles, along with the Baltimore Colts, became the second team ever in the NFL to put a logo on their helmets, with silver wings on a kelly green helmet. In 1969 the team wore two helmet versions: Kelly green with white wings in road games, and white with kelly green wings at home. From 1970 to '73, they wore the white helmets with Kelly green wings exclusively before switching back to Kelly green helmets with silver wings. By 1974, Joseph A. Scirrotto Jr. designed the silver wings within a white outline, and this style on a kelly green helmet became standard for over two decades.\n\n\nFrom 1948 to 1995, the team logo was an eagle in flight carrying a football in its claws, although from 1969 to 1972, the eagle took on a more stylized look.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| East | North | South | West |\n| * Dallas Cowboys\n* New York Giants\n* Philadelphia Eagles\n* Washington Commanders\n | * Chicago Bears\n* Detroit Lions\n* Green Bay Packers\n* Minnesota Vikings\n | * Atlanta Falcons\n* Carolina Panthers\n* New Orleans Saints\n* Tampa Bay Buccaneers\n | * Arizona Cardinals\n* Los Angeles Rams\n* San Francisco 49ers\n* Seattle Seahawks\n |\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe uncovered east stands enlarged the park's capacity to over 39,000, but the Eagles rarely drew more than 25,000 to 30,000.[22] The Eagles finished the 1937 season 2–8–1 and continued to struggle over the next three seasons.\n\n\n\n### Thompson, Wolman and the Happy Hundred era (1941–1969)[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Happy Hundred\n\nIn December 1940, Bell intervened to stop the sale of Art Rooney's Steelers to Alexis Thompson,[23] and Rooney then acquired half of Bell's interest in the Eagles.[24] In a series of events known as the *Pennsylvania Polka*,[23] Rooney and Bell exchanged their entire Eagles roster and their territorial rights in Philadelphia to Thompson for his entire Steelers roster and his rights in Pittsburgh.[25] Rooney provided assistance to Bell by rewarding him with a 20% commission on the sale of the Steelers.[26] Bell became the Steelers' head coach and Rooney became the Steelers' general manager.[27]\n\n\n\n#### Greasy Neale years (1941–1950)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThough not as famous or historic, there have been talks of an emerging rivalry between the Philadelphia Eagles and the San Francisco 49ers. The two teams have played each other 36 times (including 2 postseason games), with the Philadelphia Eagles winning 15 games, the San Francisco 49ers winning 20 games, and tying 1 time;[138] those games were often highly competitive. The rivalry really emerged with the 2023 NFC Championship game where the Eagles routed a 49ers team dealing with numerous injuries (namely to all their quarterbacks) despite having a mostly healthy top-ranked defense and becoming physically aggressive towards their opponent, allowing the Eagles to punch their ticket to the Super Bowl. Since that game, 49ers players and fans have shared their frustrations, igniting what many see as a new rivalry.[139]\n\n\n\n## Players[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Philadelphia Eagles players\n\n### Current roster[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**Philadelphia Eagles roster*** view\n* talk\n* edit\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n133. **^** \"Top 10 rivalries\". *NFL.com*.

However, the Browns lit up the Eagles' vaunted defense for 487 total yards, including 246 passing yards, in a 35–10 rout. The Eagles never recovered from the loss, and finished the 1950 season 6–6.\n\n\nFollowing the 1950 season, Greasy Neale retired and was replaced by Bo McMillin.

Jeffrey Lurie bought the Eagles on May 6, 1994, for an estimated $185 million. The club is now estimated to be the 21st most valuable sports team, worth $3.4 billion, as evaluated in 2021 by *Forbes*.[57]\n\n\nIn Lurie's first season as owner in 1994, the team went 7–9 and again missed the playoffs. Rich Kotite was fired and replaced by San Francisco 49ers defensive coordinator Ray Rhodes, who successfully lured 49ers star Ricky Watters to join the team as a free agent.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince 1996, the team has made only minor alterations, mostly related to jersey/pants combinations worn during specific games. For example, in 1997, against the San Francisco 49ers, the team wore midnight green jerseys and pants for the first of only two occasions in team history.

A year later, in the first two games of the 2003 season (both home losses, to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and New England Patriots), the Eagles wore white jerseys with white pants.

Reid's first notable step was drafting Syracuse quarterback Donovan McNabb with the second overall pick in the 1999 NFL Draft. The Eagles' awful 1998 season would have entitled the Eagle to first pick but it was awarded to the rebooted Cleveland Browns. Despite clearing the roster for new talent by releasing unpopular and aging veterans such as Ricky Watters and Irving Fryar, Reid was still a virtual unknown before his arrival as head coach, and his appointment was met initially with skepticism among Philadelphia fans. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nUpon moving to Lincoln Financial Field in 2003, the Eagles wore white at home for at least their home opener, but in recent years they opted to wear their standard midnight green jerseys even during the warmest of autumn weather.\n\n\nIn the 2010 season against the Green Bay Packers, on September 12, 2010, the Eagles wore uniforms similar to the ones that were worn by the 1960 championship team in honor the 50th anniversary of that team.[127] In weeks 4 and 6 of the 2010 season, the Eagles wore their white jerseys in a match-up against the Washington Redskins and Atlanta Falcons, respectively, before reverting to their midnight green jerseys for the rest of their home games.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n160. **^** Woolsey, Matt (September 1, 2008). \"America's Most Die-Hard Football Fans: Methodology\". *Forbes*.

Without Brian Dawkins, defensive end Trent Cole stepped up and became the dominant force on defense with 12 sacks, earning him his second trip to the Pro Bowl and All-Pro honors. In 2009, the Eagles started 5–4, then won six straight.

The cost of purchasing a share in the association was $10. However, there were also contributing memberships, ranging from $1 to $2.50, made available to the general public. The Association was a community-based non-profit organization of local residents and businesses. In keeping with its charter, which stated that \"all profits shall be donated to charity\", all of the team's excess income was donated to local charitable institutions. The original Frankford Athletic Association apparently disbanded prior to the 1909 football season. Several of the original players from the 1899 football team kept the team together, and they became known as Loyola Athletic Club. In keeping with Yellow Jackets tradition, they carried the \"Frankford\" name again in 1912, to become the Frankford Athletic Association.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n84. **^** Stites, Adam (February 5, 2018). \"The Patriots and Eagles gave us the 2nd highest-scoring Super Bowl ever\". *SB Nation*.

In 1940, Bell balked at a 66% rent increase plus 10% of the gate receipts proposed by the City of Philadelphia for use of Municipal Stadium and signed a lease for Shibe Park, which was renamed Connie Mack Stadium in 1954. At Connie Mack Stadium, the Eagles were also able to play night games, since lights were installed at the stadium the year before.[18] In the 1941 season, the Eagles played their home opener at Municipal Stadium, and then moved to Shibe Park.[19][20][21] To accommodate football at Shibe Park during the winter, management erected stands in right field, parallel to 20th Street. Some 20-feet high, these east stands included 22 rows of seats. The goalposts stood along the first base line and in left field. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1996, the Eagles' uniform colors were changed from the classic kelly green to a darker midnight green. The team got off to a good start, winning three of their first four games. However, a week-5 Monday night game at Veterans Stadium against the rival Cowboys witnessed a season-ending knee injury to Peete, loss of the team's momentum, and the transition to an offense led by Ty Detmer and Watters. While Detmer played well and Watters rushed for 1,411 yards, the season conformed to what had become a familiar pattern: 10–6 record and early elimination (a 14–0 shutout by the 49ers) in the playoffs. In the 1996 NFL draft, future fan-favorite and hall-of-famer Brian Dawkins was chosen in the 2nd round. The continued early playoff exits led fans and local media to cast blame on high-priced free agents (Irving Fryar, Watters, Troy Vincent, and Guy McIntyre) for not stepping up in big games, especially in the postseason. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n79. **^** Wesseling, Chris (January 18, 2016). \"Philadelphia Eagles hire Doug Pederson as coach\".

The game became known as the \"Fog Bowl\", due to the inclement weather during the game. The Eagles lost, 20–12.[51]\n\n\nThe following two years would see playoff appearances as well, but the team never made it past the first round. This failure was very frustrating to Eagles fans, as the team was widely regarded as among the most talented in the NFL. On offense, the Eagles were led by quarterback Cunningham, one of the most exciting players of his generation; tight end Keith Jackson; and running back Keith Byars. The defense is commonly acknowledged as among the greatest in league history, and as the best to never win a championship.[52]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Eagles traveled to New Orleans for Super Bowl XV, where they were heavily favored over the Oakland Raiders, who had squeaked into the playoffs as a wild-card team. Things did not go the Eagles' way, beginning with Tose's imprudent decision to bring comedian Don Rickles into the pregame locker room to lighten the mood. Jaworski's first pass was intercepted by Rod Martin, setting up an Oakland touchdown. Later in the first quarter, a potential game-tying 40-yard touchdown pass to Rodney Parker was nullified by an illegal-motion penalty. The final score was 27–10. Journeyman quarterback Jim Plunkett was named the game's MVP.[46]\n\n\nThe team got off to a promising start in the 1981 season by winning their first six games. They ended up 10–6 to earn a wild-card berth. However, their hopes to repeat as NFC champs were dashed in the wild-card round by the New York Giants, who won 27–21.\n\n\nAfter the Eagles finished 3–6 in the strike-shortened 1982 season, Vermeil quit the team, citing \"burnout\".\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2006, HarperCollins published *If Football's a Religion, Why Don't We Have a Prayer?*, a book by Jereé Longman, in which he describes the fans of the 700 Level at Veterans Stadium as having a reputation for \"hostile taunting, fighting, public urination and general strangeness.\"[174]\n\n\nA 1997 game against the San Francisco 49ers in Philadelphia featured so many incidents that, beginning at the following home game, the Eagles appointed a judge, Seamus McCaffery, to preside over a temporary courtroom at the stadium; 20 suspects came before him that day.[173] Fan behavior improved after the team's move to Lincoln Financial Field, and \"Eagles Court\" ended in December 2003.[175]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Invincible (2006 film) and Silver Linings Playbook\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n33. **^** Didinger, Ray; Robert S.

Foles won Super Bowl MVP going 28 for 43 with 373 passing yards, three passing touchdowns, one interception, and one receiving touchdown. Foles became the first backup quarterback to start and win a Super Bowl since his opponent Tom Brady won as the backup for Drew Bledsoe in 2002's Super Bowl XXXVI.\n\n\nThe combined 74 points scored was one point shy of the Super Bowl record of 75, set in Super Bowl XXIX in 1995; this game marked only the second time in the history of the Super Bowl where the teams combined for 70+ points.[84] The game also set a record for most yardage by both teams (combined) with 1,151 yards, the most for any single game, regular season or postseason.[85]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe drafting of McNabb was unpopular with many Eagles fans, many of whom traveled to Madison Square Garden for the 1999 Draft and booed the selection, believing the Eagles instead should have selected Ricky Williams, a University of Texas running back who had been named the 1998 AP College Player of the Year.\n\n\nThe 1999 season was largely a rebuilding year for the Eagles, who won only five games. The team, which routinely sells out its home games in Philadelphia, had two 1999 home games that failed to sell out, resulting in local TV blackouts. Another six home games in the 1999 season sold out only because several local small business owners bought the remaining unsold tickets to spare Philadelphia-area viewers a television blackout of the game. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n154. **^** Woolsey, Matt (September 1, 2008). \"In Depth: America's Most Die-Hard Football Fans\". *Forbes*.

The off-season was marred by a lockout that began in March after the NFL's collective bargaining agreement expired, making practices, trades, and free agency impossible. During the draft, the Eagles did comparatively little. After the lockout ended in July, the team embarked on a rash of high-profile FA signings, including Raiders CB Nnamdi Asomugha, Dolphins RB Ronnie Brown, Giants WR Steve Smith, Packers TE Donald Lee, Titans DE Jason Babin, and Packers DT Cullen Jenkins. Meanwhile, Kevin Kolb, displeased at losing the starting quarterback job to Michael Vick in 2010, was traded to Arizona for Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie. Replacing him as 2nd-stringer was ex-Titans quarterback Vince Young. Young created a lot of hype by calling Philadelphia the \"Dream Team\".[68] The team managed to finish only 8–8 and missed the playoffs.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter brushing aside the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 21–3, the Eagles moved to the second round of the playoffs, only to lose 20–10 to the New York Giants. After compiling an 11–5 record in 2001, the Eagles reached the playoffs again, this time at the top of their division. In a near rerun of the previous year, they disposed of the Buccaneers in a 31–9 game. In the second round, the Eagles defeated the Bears 33–19 at Soldier Field. In the NFC Championship game, they were unable to stop the St. Louis Rams, who defeated them 29–24.\n\n\nDespite injuries, McNabb led the Eagles to a 12–4 season in 2002. Once again, they reached the NFC Championship game, but lost at home 27–10 to the eventual Super Bowl champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the last game at Veterans Stadium.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Eagles and Dallas Cowboys rivalry has been listed among the best and most acrimonious in the NFL.[129][130] The Eagles won the first game in this rivalry 27–25 on September 30, 1960. Dallas leads the all-time series 73–55 as of the 2022 season, but in recent years, the series has been close, with each team winning 12 games since 2006. There is considerable hostility between the two teams' fan bases, with incidents such as the 1989 Bounty Bowl. The rivalry has even spilled over into Draft Weekend, with Cowboys legend Drew Pearson and Eagles legend David Akers exchanging insults at the opposing franchise in 2017 and 2018, respectively.[131][132]\n\n\n\n### New York Giants[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Eagles–Giants rivalry\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n67. **^** Miracle at the New Meadowlands sinks Giants-NBC Sports Archived March 29, 2019, at the Wayback Machine Retrieved July 11, 2012.\n68. **^** Vince Young declares Eagles to be a dream team-Pro Football Talk Archived March 29, 2019, at the Wayback Machine Retrieved July 10, 2012.\n69. **^** Garafolo, Mike (December 30, 2012). \"Eagles fire Reid\". *USA Today*.

The team also started wearing black cleats exclusively in 2004, although the rule was relaxed by the mid-2010s.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nCity of Philadelphia\n |\n| --- |\n| Topics | * History\n\t+ Timeline\n* Accent\n* Architecture\n* Bibliography\n* Companies\n* Cuisine\n* Culture\n* Demographics\n* Economy\n* Education\n* Media\n* Music\n* Notable people\n* Riots\n* Sites of interest\n\t+ Historic Landmarks\n* Skyscrapers\n* Transportation\n |\n| Government | * City Hall\n* Mayor\n* City Council\n* District Attorney\n* Airport\n* Fire Department\n* Free Library\n* Police Department\n* Public Health\n\t+ COVID-19 pandemic and Deltacron hybrid variant 2020-2021\n* School district\n* **Federal:** U.S. Mint\n* U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of PA\n* U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit\n |\n| Neighborhoods | * Center City\n* North Philadelphia\n\t+ Lower North\n\t+ Upper North\n\t+ Olney-Oak Lane\n* Northeast Philadelphia\n\t+ River Wards\n* Northwest Philadelphia\n* South Philadelphia\n* Southwest Philadelphia\n* West Philadelphia\n |\n| Museums | * Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University\n* African American Museum in Philadelphia\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1978 saw one of the great moments in Eagles history, The Miracle at the Meadowlands, when Herman Edwards returned a fumble by Giants' quarterback Joe Pisarcik for a touchdown with 20 seconds left in the game, resulting in a 19–17 Eagles victory.[43] The Eagles would edge into the playoffs with a 9–7 season.

Wray became the Eagles' first head coach after being persuaded to assume the position by Bell, his former teammate at Penn. The Eagles originally intended to play their home games at Shibe Park, which was the home of the Philadelphia Athletics professional baseball in Philadelphia. When negotiations for use of Shibe Park fell through, however, the Eagles struck a deal with the Athletics' crosstown rival, the Philadelphia Phillies, to begin playing at the Baker Bowl.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Links to related articles\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preceded byChicago Cardinals\n |  **NFL champions** 1948, 1949 | Succeeded byCleveland Browns\n |\n| Preceded byBaltimore Colts\n |  **NFL champions** 1960 | Succeeded byGreen Bay Packers\n |\n| Preceded byNew England Patriots\n |  **Super Bowl champions** 2017 (LII) | Succeeded byNew England Patriots\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1935, Bell proposed an annual college draft to equalize talent across the league. The draft was a revolutionary concept in professional sports. Having teams select players in inverse order of their finish in the standings, a practice still followed today, strove to increase fan interest by guaranteeing that even the worst teams would have the opportunity for annual infusions of the best college talent.[17] Between 1927, when the NFL changed from a sprawling Midwestern-based association to a narrower, major-market league, and 1934, three teams, the Chicago Bears, New York Giants, and Green Bay Packers, won all but one title with the exception of the Providence Steam Roller, which won in 1928. By 1936, the Eagles suffered significant financial losses and were sold through a public auction. Bert Bell was the only bidder and became the sole owner of the team. Wray refused a reduction in his salary and left the team. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the early 1920s, the Frankford Athletic Association's Yellow Jackets gained the reputation as being one of the best independent football teams in the nation. In 1922, Frankford absorbed the Philadelphia City Champion team, the Union Quakers of Philadelphia. That year, Frankford captured the unofficial championship of Philadelphia. During the 1922 and 1923 seasons, the Yellow Jackets compiled a 6–2–1 record against teams from the National Football League. This led to the Association being granted an NFL franchise in 1924, thus becoming the Frankford Yellow Jackets. In spite of winning the NFL championship in 1926, midway through the 1931 season, the Yellow Jackets went bankrupt and were forced to cease operations.[14]\n\n\n\n### Bell and Wray era (1933–1940)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Bert Bell and Lud Wray\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPrior to the start of the 1949 season, the Eagles were sold by Thompson to a syndicate of 100 buyers, known as the \"Happy Hundred\", each of whom paid $3,000 for a share of the team. While the leader of the \"Happy Hundred\" was noted Philadelphia businessman James P. Clark, one unsung investor was Leonard Tose.[28]\n\n\n\n##### NFL champions (1949)[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: 1949 NFL Championship Game\n\nIn 1949, the Eagles returned to the NFL Championship game for a third consecutive year. The Eagles were favored by a touchdown,[29][30][31] and won 14–0 for their second consecutive title game shutout. Running back Steve Van Buren rushed for 196 yards on 31 carries for the Eagles, and their defense held the Rams to just 21 yards on the ground.[32] Chuck Bednarik was selected as the first overall pick in the 1949 NFL Draft. An All-American lineman/linebacker from the University of Pennsylvania, Bednarik would go on to become one of the greatest and most beloved players in Eagles history.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Eagles played their first game on October 15, 1933, against the New York Giants at the Polo Grounds in New York City, and lost the game 56–0.[16] The Eagles struggled over the course of their first decade, never winning more than four games in any of their first ten seasons. Their best finish was in 1934, the second season for the Eagles, when they tied for third in the East. The Eagles' early rosters largely consisted of former Penn, Temple, and Villanova players who played for the Eagles for a few years before going on to other things.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1943, with player shortages stemming from the U.S. entry engagement in World War II, it became difficult to fill the roster, and the team merged with the Steelers to form the \"Phil-Pitt Eagles\", known as the Steagles. Greasy Neale continued to coach the team along with Steelers head coach Walt Kiesling. The team finished the 1943 season with a 5–4–1 record, and the merger, which was never intended to be a permanent arrangement, was dissolved at the season's end.\n\n\nIn 1944, the Eagles, led by head coach Greasy Neale and running back Steve Van Buren, had their first winning season in team history. After two second-place finishes in 1945 and 1946, the team reached the NFL Championship game for the first time in 1947. Van Buren, Pete Pihos, and Bosh Pritchard fought valiantly, but the young team lost to the Chicago Cardinals, 28–21 at Comiskey Park in Chicago.\n\n\n\n##### NFL champions (1948)[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: 1948 NFL Championship Game and 1948 Philadelphia Eagles season\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Eagles were a part of the NFL Eastern Division from 1933 to 1949, the National Conference from 1950 to 1953, and the Eastern Conference from 1953 to 1966. They were then placed in the Capitol Division of the Eastern Conference in 1967. When the league reformed into the NFC and AFC in 1970, the Eagles were placed in the NFC East. \n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Coach\n | Record\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1947 | Greasy Neale | 8–4\n |\n| 1948 | 11–5\n |\n| 1949 | 11–5\n |\n| 1960 | Buck Shaw | 10–2\n |\n| 1980 | Dick Vermeil | 12–4\n |\n| 1988 | Buddy Ryan | 10–6\n |\n| 2001 | Andy Reid | 11–5\n |\n| 2002 | 12–4\n |\n| 2003 | 12–4\n |\n| 2004 | 13–3\n |\n| 2006 | 10–6\n |\n| 2010 | 10–6\n |\n| 2013 | Chip Kelly | 10–6\n |\n| 2017 | Doug Pederson | 13–3\n |\n| 2019 | 9–7\n |\n| 2022 | Nick Sirianni | 14–3\n |\n| **Total Division Championships won: 16** |\n\n\n## Logo and uniforms[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Protective equipment in gridiron football and National Football League uniform numbers\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Season\n | Coach\n | Super Bowl\n | Location\n | Opponent\n | Score\n | Record\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2017 | Doug Pederson | LII | U.S. Bank Stadium (Minneapolis) | New England Patriots | 41–33 | 13–3\n |\n| **Total Super Bowls won: 1** |  |\n\n\n### NFC championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Season\n | Coach\n | Location\n | Opponent\n | Score\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1980 | Dick Vermeil | Veterans Stadium (Philadelphia) | Dallas Cowboys | 20–7\n |\n| 2004 | Andy Reid | Lincoln Financial Field (Philadelphia) | Atlanta Falcons | 27–10\n |\n| 2017 | Doug Pederson | Lincoln Financial Field (Philadelphia) | Minnesota Vikings | 38–7\n |\n| 2022 | Nick Sirianni | Lincoln Financial Field (Philadelphia) | San Francisco 49ers | 31–7\n |\n| **Total NFC Championships won: 4** |  |\n\n\n### Division championships[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Eastern Division (1933–1949)\n* American Conference (1950–1952)\n* Eastern Conference (1953–1969)\n\t+ Capitol Division (1967–1969)\n* **National Football Conference (1970–present)**\n\t+ **NFC East (1970–present)**\n |\n| **Current uniform**\n |\n| ![](image)\n |\n| Team colors | Midnight green, silver, black, white[3][4][5]        |\n| Fight song | \"Fly, Eagles Fly\" |\n| Mascot | Swoop |\n| Personnel |\n| Owner(s) | Jeffrey Lurie[6] |\n| CEO | Jeffrey Lurie |\n| President | Don Smolenski |\n| General manager | Howie Roseman |\n| Head coach | Nick Sirianni |\n| Team history |\n| * **Philadelphia Eagles (1933–1942, 1944–present)**\n* Phil-Pitt \"Steagles\" (1943)\n |\n| Team nicknames |\n| * **The Birds**\n* **The Iggles**\n |\n| Championships |\n| **League championships (4)*** **NFL championships (pre-1970 AFL–NFL merger) (3)**1948, 1949, 1960\n* **Super Bowl championships (1)**2017 (LII)\n |\n| **Conference championships (5)*** **NFL Eastern:** 1960\n* **NFC:** 1980, 2004, 2017, 2022\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe team's intense rivalry with the New York Giants has been ranked the top rivalry of all time by NFL Network, the fourth-best NFL rivalry by *Sports Illustrated*,[8] and one of the fiercest and best-known football rivalries by ESPN.[9] The Eagles' bitter rivalry with the Dallas Cowboys has become more high-profile and intense since the 1960s, and the team has a historic rivalry with the Washington Commanders.

Shaw, Van Brocklin, and Bednarik, each in their last season before retirement, led an Eagles team more notable for its grit than its talent. One observer later quipped that the team had \"nothing but a championship\" to its first division title since 1949. The team was aided by their two Pro Bowl receivers, wide receiver Tommy McDonald, who later wrote an autobiography titled *They Pay Me to Catch Footballs*, and tight end Pete Retzlaff.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Eagles and Pittsburgh Steelers are both located in Pennsylvania and began play in 1933. From that season through 1966, this was a major rivalry for both teams, as both were part of the same division. In 1967 they were placed in separate divisions, but remained in the same conference for three years. In 1970 the Steelers (along with the Cleveland Browns and Baltimore Colts) moved to the American Football Conference, while the Eagles stayed with the rest of the old-line NFL teams in the National Football Conference. As a result, the Eagles and Steelers no longer played each other every year; instead, they are scheduled to meet once every four years in the regular season. The most recent meeting was in 2022 at Lincoln Financial Field due to the addition of a regular season game based on opposing conference divisional finish from the season before, with the Eagles winning 35-13. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhile the remnants of the great 1940s teams managed to stay competitive for the first few years of the decade, and younger players like Bobby Walston and Sonny Jurgensen occasionally provided infusions of talent, the team lacked the total talent necessary for true greatness during most of the 1950s.\n\n\nAfter the 1957 season, the Eagles moved from Connie Mack Stadium to Franklin Field at the University of Pennsylvania. Franklin Field had a vastly expanded seating capacity for the Eagles. While Connie Mack Stadium had a capacity of 39,000, Franklin Field's capacity was 60,000.[33] In 1969, the grass field at Franklin Field was replaced by AstroTurf, making Franklin Field the first NFL stadium to use artificial turf.\n\n\n\n#### Buck Shaw years (1958–1960)[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: 1960 NFL Championship Game and Buck Shaw\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTo celebrate the team's 75th anniversary, the 2007 uniforms featured a 75th-season logo patch on the left shoulder. In addition, the team wore \"throwback\" jerseys in a 2007 game against the Detroit Lions. The yellow and blue jerseys, the same colors found on Philadelphia's city flag, are based on those worn by the Philadelphia Eagles in the team's inaugural season, and had been the same colors used by the Frankford Yellow Jackets franchise prior to its suspension of operations in 1931. The Eagles beat Detroit, 56–21.[126]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWhile not as big as the rivalries with the Giants and Cowboys, the Eagles' historical rivalry with the Washington Redskins and Washington Commanders has still been fierce. Although the two franchises played in the same division in the Eagles' inaugural 1933 season, their first meeting did not take place until October 21, 1934, during Washington's first year under the Boston Redskins moniker; the Redskins defeated the Eagles 6–0 at Fenway Park. Washington currently leads the all-time series 89–84–6. Since 2010, the rivalry has been very even overall with the Eagles winning 16 of the last 27 matchups.[135]\n\n\n\n### Pittsburgh Steelers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Eagles–Steelers rivalry\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Steve Van Buren, Eagles halfback from 1944 to 1951, was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1965.\n![](image)Chuck Bednarik, Eagles linebacker and center from 1949 to 1962, was inducted into Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1967.\n![](image)Pete Pihos, Eagles tight end from 1947 to 1955, was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1970.\nUndeterred, the young team rebounded in 1948 to return to the NFL Championship game. With home field advantage and a blinding snowstorm on their side, the Eagles won their first NFL Championship against the Chicago Cardinals by a score of 7–0. The only score came in the fourth quarter when Steve Van Buren ran for a five-yard touchdown. Because of the severe weather, few fans witnessed the joyous occasion.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n47. **^** \"Didinger: When the Eagles Almost Left Philly\".

The Bell–Wray group had to pay an entry fee of $3,500, or roughly $67,000 USD in inflation-adjusted 2022 dollars, and assumed a total debt of $11,000 the Yellow Jackets owed to three other NFL franchises.[15] Drawing inspiration from the Blue Eagle logo of the National Recovery Administration, a centerpiece of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal policies,[15] Bell and Wray named their new franchise the Philadelphia Eagles. While it could seem as if the Yellow Jackets simply rebranded as the Eagles, both the Eagles organization and NFL officially regard the teams as two separate entities. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Veterans Stadium in South Philadelphia, the Eagles' home field from 1971 to 2002, which they shared with baseball's Phillies\nIn 1969, Leonard Tose bought the team from Wolman for $16.155 million,[39] the equivalent of $134 million today, representing a record then for the highest amount ever paid for a professional sports franchise.

From 1970 to '73, they wore the white helmets with Kelly green wings exclusively before switching back to Kelly green helmets with silver wings. By 1974, Joseph A. Scirrotto Jr. designed the silver wings within a white outline, and this style on a kelly green helmet became standard for over two decades.\n\n\nFrom 1948 to 1995, the team logo was an eagle in flight carrying a football in its claws, although from 1969 to 1972, the eagle took on a more stylized look.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| East | North | South | West |\n| * Dallas Cowboys\n* New York Giants\n* Philadelphia Eagles\n* Washington Commanders\n | * Chicago Bears\n* Detroit Lions\n* Green Bay Packers\n* Minnesota Vikings\n | * Atlanta Falcons\n* Carolina Panthers\n* New Orleans Saints\n* Tampa Bay Buccaneers\n | * Arizona Cardinals\n* Los Angeles Rams\n* San Francisco 49ers\n* Seattle Seahawks\n |\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe uncovered east stands enlarged the park's capacity to over 39,000, but the Eagles rarely drew more than 25,000 to 30,000.[22] The Eagles finished the 1937 season 2–8–1 and continued to struggle over the next three seasons.\n\n\n\n### Thompson, Wolman and the Happy Hundred era (1941–1969)[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Happy Hundred\n\nIn December 1940, Bell intervened to stop the sale of Art Rooney's Steelers to Alexis Thompson,[23] and Rooney then acquired half of Bell's interest in the Eagles.[24] In a series of events known as the *Pennsylvania Polka*,[23] Rooney and Bell exchanged their entire Eagles roster and their territorial rights in Philadelphia to Thompson for his entire Steelers roster and his rights in Pittsburgh.[25] Rooney provided assistance to Bell by rewarding him with a 20% commission on the sale of the Steelers.[26] Bell became the Steelers' head coach and Rooney became the Steelers' general manager.[27]\n\n\n\n#### Greasy Neale years (1941–1950)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThough not as famous or historic, there have been talks of an emerging rivalry between the Philadelphia Eagles and the San Francisco 49ers. The two teams have played each other 36 times (including 2 postseason games), with the Philadelphia Eagles winning 15 games, the San Francisco 49ers winning 20 games, and tying 1 time;[138] those games were often highly competitive. The rivalry really emerged with the 2023 NFC Championship game where the Eagles routed a 49ers team dealing with numerous injuries (namely to all their quarterbacks) despite having a mostly healthy top-ranked defense and becoming physically aggressive towards their opponent, allowing the Eagles to punch their ticket to the Super Bowl. Since that game, 49ers players and fans have shared their frustrations, igniting what many see as a new rivalry.[139]\n\n\n\n## Players[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Philadelphia Eagles players\n\n### Current roster[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**Philadelphia Eagles roster*** view\n* talk\n* edit\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n133. **^** \"Top 10 rivalries\". *NFL.com*.

However, the Browns lit up the Eagles' vaunted defense for 487 total yards, including 246 passing yards, in a 35–10 rout. The Eagles never recovered from the loss, and finished the 1950 season 6–6.\n\n\nFollowing the 1950 season, Greasy Neale retired and was replaced by Bo McMillin.

Jeffrey Lurie bought the Eagles on May 6, 1994, for an estimated $185 million. The club is now estimated to be the 21st most valuable sports team, worth $3.4 billion, as evaluated in 2021 by *Forbes*.[57]\n\n\nIn Lurie's first season as owner in 1994, the team went 7–9 and again missed the playoffs. Rich Kotite was fired and replaced by San Francisco 49ers defensive coordinator Ray Rhodes, who successfully lured 49ers star Ricky Watters to join the team as a free agent.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince 1996, the team has made only minor alterations, mostly related to jersey/pants combinations worn during specific games. For example, in 1997, against the San Francisco 49ers, the team wore midnight green jerseys and pants for the first of only two occasions in team history. The second occasion was in 2002, during the final regular season game at Veterans Stadium, a win over the division-rival Washington Redskins. A year later, in the first two games of the 2003 season (both home losses, to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and New England Patriots), the Eagles wore white jerseys with white pants. After that, the white jerseys along with white pants were worn exclusively during preseason games from 2004 to 2011, with the exception of 2007 and 2010.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* National Constitution Center\n* National Liberty Museum\n* National Museum of American Jewish History\n* Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts\n* Philadelphia History Museum\n* Philadelphia Museum of Art\n* Philadelphia's Magic Gardens\n* Please Touch Museum\n* Powel House\n* RittenhouseTown\n* Rodin Museum\n* Rosenbach Museum and Library\n* Ryerss Museum and Library\n* Science History Institute\n* Shofuso Japanese House and Garden\n* Stenton\n* Thaddeus Kosciuszko National Memorial\n* Penn Museum\n* Wagner Free Institute of Science\n* Woodmere Art Museum\n* Wyck House\n |\n| Sports | * 76ers\n* Eagles\n* Flyers\n* Freedoms\n* Phillies\n* Union\n |\n| Squares | * Centre\n* Franklin\n* Logan\n* Rittenhouse\n* Washington\n |\n| Related | * Delaware Valley\n* Carpenters' Hall\n* Independence Hall\n* Congress Hall\n* Liberty Bell\n* Syng inkstand\n* SS *United States*\n* 2016 Democratic National Convention\n |\n| * ![](image) Category\n* ![](image) Portal\n |\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Eagles reemerged as a predominant NFL team under the leadership of new head coach Andy Reid, who was hired away from the Green Bay Packers, where he was the Packers' quarterback coach.

Despite clearing the roster for new talent by releasing unpopular and aging veterans such as Ricky Watters and Irving Fryar, Reid was still a virtual unknown before his arrival as head coach, and his appointment was met initially with skepticism among Philadelphia fans. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nUpon moving to Lincoln Financial Field in 2003, the Eagles wore white at home for at least their home opener, but in recent years they opted to wear their standard midnight green jerseys even during the warmest of autumn weather.\n\n\nIn the 2010 season against the Green Bay Packers, on September 12, 2010, the Eagles wore uniforms similar to the ones that were worn by the 1960 championship team in honor the 50th anniversary of that team.[127] In weeks 4 and 6 of the 2010 season, the Eagles wore their white jerseys in a match-up against the Washington Redskins and Atlanta Falcons, respectively, before reverting to their midnight green jerseys for the rest of their home games.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n160. **^** Woolsey, Matt (September 1, 2008). \"America's Most Die-Hard Football Fans: Methodology\". *Forbes*.

Without Brian Dawkins, defensive end Trent Cole stepped up and became the dominant force on defense with 12 sacks, earning him his second trip to the Pro Bowl and All-Pro honors. In 2009, the Eagles started 5–4, then won six straight.

The cost of purchasing a share in the association was $10. However, there were also contributing memberships, ranging from $1 to $2.50, made available to the general public. The Association was a community-based non-profit organization of local residents and businesses. In keeping with its charter, which stated that \"all profits shall be donated to charity\", all of the team's excess income was donated to local charitable institutions. The original Frankford Athletic Association apparently disbanded prior to the 1909 football season. Several of the original players from the 1899 football team kept the team together, and they became known as Loyola Athletic Club. In keeping with Yellow Jackets tradition, they carried the \"Frankford\" name again in 1912, to become the Frankford Athletic Association.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n84. **^** Stites, Adam (February 5, 2018). \"The Patriots and Eagles gave us the 2nd highest-scoring Super Bowl ever\". *SB Nation*.

In 1940, Bell balked at a 66% rent increase plus 10% of the gate receipts proposed by the City of Philadelphia for use of Municipal Stadium and signed a lease for Shibe Park, which was renamed Connie Mack Stadium in 1954. At Connie Mack Stadium, the Eagles were also able to play night games, since lights were installed at the stadium the year before.[18] In the 1941 season, the Eagles played their home opener at Municipal Stadium, and then moved to Shibe Park.[19][20][21] To accommodate football at Shibe Park during the winter, management erected stands in right field, parallel to 20th Street. Some 20-feet high, these east stands included 22 rows of seats. The goalposts stood along the first base line and in left field. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1996, the Eagles' uniform colors were changed from the classic kelly green to a darker midnight green. The team got off to a good start, winning three of their first four games. However, a week-5 Monday night game at Veterans Stadium against the rival Cowboys witnessed a season-ending knee injury to Peete, loss of the team's momentum, and the transition to an offense led by Ty Detmer and Watters. While Detmer played well and Watters rushed for 1,411 yards, the season conformed to what had become a familiar pattern: 10–6 record and early elimination (a 14–0 shutout by the 49ers) in the playoffs. In the 1996 NFL draft, future fan-favorite and hall-of-famer Brian Dawkins was chosen in the 2nd round. The continued early playoff exits led fans and local media to cast blame on high-priced free agents (Irving Fryar, Watters, Troy Vincent, and Guy McIntyre) for not stepping up in big games, especially in the postseason. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n79. **^** Wesseling, Chris (January 18, 2016). \"Philadelphia Eagles hire Doug Pederson as coach\".

The game became known as the \"Fog Bowl\", due to the inclement weather during the game. The Eagles lost, 20–12.[51]\n\n\nThe following two years would see playoff appearances as well, but the team never made it past the first round. This failure was very frustrating to Eagles fans, as the team was widely regarded as among the most talented in the NFL. On offense, the Eagles were led by quarterback Cunningham, one of the most exciting players of his generation; tight end Keith Jackson; and running back Keith Byars. The defense is commonly acknowledged as among the greatest in league history, and as the best to never win a championship.[52]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Eagles traveled to New Orleans for Super Bowl XV, where they were heavily favored over the Oakland Raiders, who had squeaked into the playoffs as a wild-card team. Things did not go the Eagles' way, beginning with Tose's imprudent decision to bring comedian Don Rickles into the pregame locker room to lighten the mood. Jaworski's first pass was intercepted by Rod Martin, setting up an Oakland touchdown. Later in the first quarter, a potential game-tying 40-yard touchdown pass to Rodney Parker was nullified by an illegal-motion penalty. The final score was 27–10. Journeyman quarterback Jim Plunkett was named the game's MVP.[46]\n\n\nThe team got off to a promising start in the 1981 season by winning their first six games. They ended up 10–6 to earn a wild-card berth. However, their hopes to repeat as NFC champs were dashed in the wild-card round by the New York Giants, who won 27–21.\n\n\nAfter the Eagles finished 3–6 in the strike-shortened 1982 season, Vermeil quit the team, citing \"burnout\".\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2006, HarperCollins published *If Football's a Religion, Why Don't We Have a Prayer?*, a book by Jereé Longman, in which he describes the fans of the 700 Level at Veterans Stadium as having a reputation for \"hostile taunting, fighting, public urination and general strangeness.\"[174]\n\n\nA 1997 game against the San Francisco 49ers in Philadelphia featured so many incidents that, beginning at the following home game, the Eagles appointed a judge, Seamus McCaffery, to preside over a temporary courtroom at the stadium; 20 suspects came before him that day.[173] Fan behavior improved after the team's move to Lincoln Financial Field, and \"Eagles Court\" ended in December 2003.[175]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Invincible (2006 film) and Silver Linings Playbook\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n33. **^** Didinger, Ray; Robert S.

Foles won Super Bowl MVP going 28 for 43 with 373 passing yards, three passing touchdowns, one interception, and one receiving touchdown. Foles became the first backup quarterback to start and win a Super Bowl since his opponent Tom Brady won as the backup for Drew Bledsoe in 2002's Super Bowl XXXVI.\n\n\nThe combined 74 points scored was one point shy of the Super Bowl record of 75, set in Super Bowl XXIX in 1995; this game marked only the second time in the history of the Super Bowl where the teams combined for 70+ points.[84] The game also set a record for most yardage by both teams (combined) with 1,151 yards, the most for any single game, regular season or postseason.[85]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe drafting of McNabb was unpopular with many Eagles fans, many of whom traveled to Madison Square Garden for the 1999 Draft and booed the selection, believing the Eagles instead should have selected Ricky Williams, a University of Texas running back who had been named the 1998 AP College Player of the Year.\n\n\nThe 1999 season was largely a rebuilding year for the Eagles, who won only five games. The team, which routinely sells out its home games in Philadelphia, had two 1999 home games that failed to sell out, resulting in local TV blackouts. Another six home games in the 1999 season sold out only because several local small business owners bought the remaining unsold tickets to spare Philadelphia-area viewers a television blackout of the game. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n154. **^** Woolsey, Matt (September 1, 2008). \"In Depth: America's Most Die-Hard Football Fans\". *Forbes*.

The off-season was marred by a lockout that began in March after the NFL's collective bargaining agreement expired, making practices, trades, and free agency impossible. During the draft, the Eagles did comparatively little. After the lockout ended in July, the team embarked on a rash of high-profile FA signings, including Raiders CB Nnamdi Asomugha, Dolphins RB Ronnie Brown, Giants WR Steve Smith, Packers TE Donald Lee, Titans DE Jason Babin, and Packers DT Cullen Jenkins. Meanwhile, Kevin Kolb, displeased at losing the starting quarterback job to Michael Vick in 2010, was traded to Arizona for Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie. Replacing him as 2nd-stringer was ex-Titans quarterback Vince Young. Young created a lot of hype by calling Philadelphia the \"Dream Team\".[68] The team managed to finish only 8–8 and missed the playoffs.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter brushing aside the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 21–3, the Eagles moved to the second round of the playoffs, only to lose 20–10 to the New York Giants. After compiling an 11–5 record in 2001, the Eagles reached the playoffs again, this time at the top of their division. In a near rerun of the previous year, they disposed of the Buccaneers in a 31–9 game. In the second round, the Eagles defeated the Bears 33–19 at Soldier Field. In the NFC Championship game, they were unable to stop the St. Louis Rams, who defeated them 29–24.\n\n\nDespite injuries, McNabb led the Eagles to a 12–4 season in 2002. Once again, they reached the NFC Championship game, but lost at home 27–10 to the eventual Super Bowl champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the last game at Veterans Stadium.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Eagles and Dallas Cowboys rivalry has been listed among the best and most acrimonious in the NFL.[129][130] The Eagles won the first game in this rivalry 27–25 on September 30, 1960. Dallas leads the all-time series 73–55 as of the 2022 season, but in recent years, the series has been close, with each team winning 12 games since 2006. There is considerable hostility between the two teams' fan bases, with incidents such as the 1989 Bounty Bowl. The rivalry has even spilled over into Draft Weekend, with Cowboys legend Drew Pearson and Eagles legend David Akers exchanging insults at the opposing franchise in 2017 and 2018, respectively.[131][132]\n\n\n\n### New York Giants[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Eagles–Giants rivalry\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n67. **^** Miracle at the New Meadowlands sinks Giants-NBC Sports Archived March 29, 2019, at the Wayback Machine Retrieved July 11, 2012.\n68. **^** Vince Young declares Eagles to be a dream team-Pro Football Talk Archived March 29, 2019, at the Wayback Machine Retrieved July 10, 2012.\n69. **^** Garafolo, Mike (December 30, 2012). \"Eagles fire Reid\". *USA Today*.

The Flyers compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Metropolitan Division in the Eastern Conference.[3] The team plays its home games in Wells Fargo Center in the South Philadelphia Sports Complex, an indoor arena they share with the Philadelphia 76ers of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the Philadelphia Wings of the National Lacrosse League (NLL). Part of the 1967 NHL Expansion, the Flyers are the first of the expansion teams in the post–Original Six era to win the Stanley Cup, victorious in 1973–74 and again in 1974–75.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Quakers' dormant NHL franchise was finally canceled by the league in 1936.[10][11]\n\n\nIn 1946, a group led by Montreal and Philadelphia sportsman Len Peto announced plans to put another NHL team in Philadelphia, to build a $2.5 million rink to seat 20,000 where the Phillies' former ballpark stood at Broad and Huntingdon Streets, and to acquire the franchise of the old Montreal Maroons.[12] The latter was held by the Canadian Arena Company, owner of the Montreal Canadiens. However, Peto's group was unable to raise funding for the new arena project by the league-imposed deadline, and the NHL cancelled the Maroons franchise.[13][14][15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhile attending a basketball game on November 29, 1964, at the Boston Garden, Ed Snider, the then-vice-president of the Philadelphia Eagles, observed a crowd of Boston Bruins fans lining up to purchase tickets to see a last-place ice hockey team.[16] He began making plans for a new arena upon hearing the NHL was looking to expand due to fears of a competing league taking hold on the West Coast and the desire for a new television contract in the United States. Snider made his proposal to the league, which chose the Philadelphia group – including Snider, Bill Putnam, Jerome Schiff and Philadelphia Eagles owner Jerry Wolman – over the Baltimore group.\n\n\nOn April 4, 1966, Putnam announced that there was going to be a name-the-team contest.[17] Details of the contest were released on July 12.[17] The team name was announced on August 3.[17]\n\n\n\n### Early years (1967–1971)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPrior to 1967, Philadelphia had only iced a team in the NHL in the 1930–31 season, when the financially struggling Pittsburgh Pirates relocated in 1930 as the Philadelphia Quakers, playing at The Arena at 46th and Market Streets. The club, garbed in orange and black like today's Flyers, was coached by J. Cooper Smeaton, who was to be elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame 30 years later, for his far more notable role as an NHL referee. Among the young Quakers' skaters in 1930–31 was another future Hall of Famer in 19-year-old rookie center Syd Howe. The Quakers' only \"claim to fame\" was to establish a single season NHL record for futility which has stood ever since, by compiling a dismal record of 4–36–4, still the fewest games ever won in a season by an NHL club. The Quakers quietly suspended operations after that single dreadful campaign to again leave the Can-Am League's Philadelphia Arrows as Philadelphia's lone hockey team. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![Pennsylvania](image) Sports teams based in Pennsylvania\n |\n| --- |\n| Australian Rules Football | USAFL\nPhiladelphia Hawks\n |\n| Baseball | MLB\nPhiladelphia Phillies\nPittsburgh Pirates\nIL\nLehigh Valley IronPigs\nScranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders\nEL\nAltoona Curve\nErie SeaWolves\nHarrisburg Senators\nReading Fightin Phils\nALPB\nLancaster Stormers\nYork Revolution\nMLBDL\nState College Spikes\nWilliamsport Crosscutters\nFL\nWashington Wild Things\nPL\nJohnstown Mill Rats\n |\n| Basketball | NBA\nPhiladelphia 76ers\n |\n| Cricket | * Lehigh Valley Cricket Club\n* Philadelphia Cricket Club\n |\n| Esports | OWL\nPhiladelphia Fusion\n |\n| Football | NFL\nPhiladelphia Eagles\nPittsburgh Steelers\nAFL\nPhiladelphia Soul\nGDFL\nErie Express\nWFA\nPhiladelphia Phantomz\nPittsburgh Passion\n |\n| Ice hockey | NHL\nPhiladelphia Flyers\nPittsburgh Penguins\nAHL\nHershey Bears\nLehigh Valley Phantoms\nWilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins\nECHL\nReading Royals\nOHL\nErie Otters\nNAHL\nJohnstown Tomahawks\nEHL\nPhiladelphia Little Flyers\nPhiladelphia Junior Flyers\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nPhiladelphia Flyers seasons\n |\n| --- |\n| 1960s | * 1960–61 . 1961–62 . 1962–63 . 1963–64 . 1964–66 . 1965–66 . 1966–67 . 1967–68\n* 1968–69\n* 1969–70\n |\n| 1970s | * 1970–71\n* 1971–72\n* 1972–73\n* 1973–74\n* 1974–75\n* 1975–76\n* 1976–77\n* 1977–78\n* 1978–79\n* 1979–80\n |\n| 1980s | * 1980–81\n* 1981–82\n* 1982–83\n* 1983–84\n* 1984–85\n* 1985–86\n* 1986–87\n* 1987–88\n* 1988–89\n* 1989–90\n |\n| 1990s | * 1990–91\n* 1991–92\n* 1992–93\n* 1993–94\n* 1994–95\n* 1995–96\n* 1996–97\n* 1997–98\n* 1998–99\n* 1999–00\n |\n| 2000s | * 2000–01\n* 2001–02\n* 2002–03\n* 2003–04\n* 2004–05\n* 2005–06\n* 2006–07\n* 2007–08\n* 2008–09\n* 2009–10\n |\n| 2010s | * 2010–11\n* 2011–12\n* 2012–13\n* 2013–14\n* 2014–15\n* 2015–16\n* 2016–17\n* 2017–18\n* 2018–19\n* 2019–20\n |\n| 2020s | * 2020–21\n* 2021–22\n* 2022–23\n* 2023–24\n |\n| Highlighted seasons indicate Stanley Cup championship\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNational Hockey League\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Western Conference | Eastern Conference |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNPSL\nAtlantic City FC\nTorch FC\n |\n| Tennis | WTT\nPhiladelphia Freedoms (defunct)\n |\n| Lacrosse | NLL\nPhiladelphia Wings\nPLL\nPhiladelphia Waterdogs\n |\n| Ultimate | AUDL\nPhiladelphia Phoenix\n |\n| College athletics (NCAA Div.

In the 1972–73 season the Flyers got rid of the mediocre expansion team label and instead became the intimidating \"Broad Street Bullies\", a nickname coined by Jack Chevalier and Pete Cafone of the *Philadelphia Bulletin* on January 3, 1973,[24] after a 3–1 brawling victory over the Atlanta Flames that led Chevalier to write in his game account, \"The image of the fightin' Flyers spreading gradually around the NHL, and people are dreaming up wild nicknames. They're the Mean Machine, the Bullies of Broad Street and Freddy's Philistines.\" Cafone wrote the accompanying headline: \"Broad Street Bullies Muscle Atlanta.\"[25] That same month, Clarke was the youngest player (at that time) in NHL history to be named team captain, replacing Ed Van Impe. Rick MacLeish became the first Flyer to score 50 goals in a season and the Flyers recorded their first winning season.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDespite having lost in the playoffs, the team had very high expectations entering the 2020–21 season. The NHL did not begin the season until January 13, 2021, due to the ongoing global pandemic. NHL divisions would be temporarily realigned due to travel restrictions, placing the Flyers in the East Division.[51] The team managed to finish the first month of play tied for first place in the league, with a 7–2–1 record. However things began to unravel as the season continued. The team fell out of playoff contention by early March and would finish the season with the most goals scored against in the league. Management vowed to address the issues the team had suffered during the season by making several trades and free agent signings. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Bobby Clarke played for the Flyers from 1969–70 to 1983–84\nTheir opponent, Bobby Orr and the Boston Bruins, took Game 1 in Boston, but Bobby Clarke scored an overtime goal in Game 2 to even the series. The Flyers then won Games 3 and 4 at home to take a 3–1 series lead, though Boston won Game 5 to stave off elimination. That set the stage for Game 6 at the Spectrum. Kate Smith appeared in person before Game 6 to sing her rendition of \"God Bless America\", even miming a \"knockout punch\" after her performance. The Flyers picked up the lead early when Rick MacLeish scored a first-period goal. Late in the game, Orr hauled down Clarke on a breakaway, a penalty which assured the Flyers of victory. Time expired as the Flyers brought the Stanley Cup to Philadelphia for the first time. Parent, having shutout Boston in Game 6, won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the MVP of the playoffs.\n\n\n\n#### 1974–75 Stanley Cup champions[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCome playoff time, the Flyers swept the Atlanta Flames in four games in the first round. In the Semi-finals, the Flyers faced the New York Rangers. The series, which saw the home team win every game, went seven games. Fortunately for the Flyers, they had home-ice advantage as they advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals by winning Game 7 and in the process made history by becoming the first expansion team to win a playoff series over an Original Six team.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSee also: List of Philadelphia Flyers players and List of Philadelphia Flyers award winners\n\n#### Hall of Fame[edit]\n\n\nThe Philadelphia Flyers recognize an affiliation with a number of inductees to the Hockey Hall of Fame, including 13 former players and six builders of the sport. The six individuals recognized as builders by the Hall of Fame includes former general managers, head coaches, and owners.[148] Inducted in 1984, Bernie Parent was the first Flyers-affiliated player to be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame.[148]\n\n\nIn addition to players and builders, members of Philadelphia's sports media have also been recognized by the Hockey Hall of Fame. In 1997, Gene Hart, a sports announcer for the Flyers, received the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award from the Hockey Hall of Fame for his contributions to hockey broadcasting.[149] In 2013, Jay Greenberg of the *Philadelphia Daily News* was awarded the Elmer Ferguson Memorial Award for his work in hockey journalism.[150]\n\n\n**Players**\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Flyers Unveil New Uniforms Featuring Burnt Orange for 2023-24 season\". *PhiladelphiaFlyers.com*.

Despite a slight drop-off in performance, the Flyers dominated the Patrick Division with what proved to be their fourth-straight division title. After disposing of Toronto in six games, the Flyers found themselves in the Semi-finals for the fifth consecutive season. Pitted against Boston, the Flyers lost Games 1 and 2 at home in overtime and did not return home as they were swept in four straight games. The Flyers lost their hold on the Patrick Division in 1977–78 and settled for second place. After sweeping the Colorado Rockies in two games in the preliminary round, the Flyers moved on to beat Buffalo in five games. They then faced Boston in the semi-finals for the second consecutive season, and lost again, this time in five games. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Name\n | Appointment\n | Departure\n | Refs\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Bud Poile | May 31, 1966\n | December 19, 1969\n | [139][140] |\n| Keith Allen | December 22, 1969\n | May 27, 1983\n | [140][141] |\n| Bob McCammon | May 27, 1983\n | April 25, 1984\n | [114][141] |\n| Bobby Clarke | May 15, 1984June 15, 1994\n | April 16, 1990October 22, 2006\n | [83][142][129][143] |\n| Russ Farwell | June 6, 1990\n | June 15, 1994\n | [144][143] |\n| Paul Holmgren | October 22, 2006\n | May 7, 2014\n | [129][145] |\n| Ron Hextall | May 7, 2014\n | November 26, 2018\n | [145][44] |\n| Chuck Fletcher | December 3, 2018\n | March 10, 2023\n | [146][147] |\n| Daniel Briere | March 10, 2023\n | —\n | [147] |\n\n\n |\n\n### First-round draft picks[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Philadelphia Flyers draft picks\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n62. **^** \"Flyers trade longtime captain Giroux to Panthers\". *ESPN.com*.

However, they could not overcome the odds a third time and eventually succumbed to the Oilers, 3–1, in Game 7. Hextall was voted playoff MVP, the second time a Flyer won the Conn Smythe Trophy despite being on the losing team (the other being another Manitoban, Reggie Leach, in 1976).[31]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAlso known as the Battle of Pennsylvania, the Flyers-Penguins rivalry is considered by many to be one of the most intense rivalries in the NHL. Both teams entered the league in 1967 with the Flyers finding success in the league early on while the Penguins struggled in the early years. The Flyers record against the Penguins from 1967 to 1989 was 89–36–19, and most notably during this time the Penguins had a 42 game winless streak at the Spectrum, lasting from 1974 until 1989. The two teams met for the first time in the playoffs in the 1989 Patrick Division Finals, where the Flyers defeated the higher seeded Penguins in seven games. The teams faced each other again in the 1997 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals, with the Flyers winning the series in five games. Penguins legend Mario Lemieux decided to retire at the end of the series for the first time and left the ice to a standing ovation in Philadelphia after game five. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPhiladelphia Flyers retired numbers\n| No.\n | Player\n | Position\n | Career\n | Date of retirement\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Bernie Parent | Goaltender | 1967–1971, 1973–1979 | October 11, 1979 |\n| 2 | Mark Howe | Defense | 1982–1992 | March 6, 2012 |\n| 4 | Barry Ashbee | Defense | 1970–1974 | October 13, 1977[151][156] |\n| 7 | Bill Barber | Left Wing | 1972–1984 | October 11, 1990 |\n| 16 | Bobby Clarke | Center | 1969–1984 | November 15, 1984 |\n| 88 | Eric Lindros | Center | 1992–2000 | January 18, 2018[155] |\n\n\n#### Flyers Hall of Fame[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of Philadelphia Flyers award winners § Flyers Hall of Fame\n\nEstablished in 1988, the Flyers Hall of Fame was designed to \"permanently honor those individuals who have contributed to the franchise's success.\"[157] Candidates for the hall are nominated and voted upon by a panel of media members and team officials.[157] To date, 27 former players and executives have been inducted.[158]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Flyers' all-time points percentage of 57.1% (as of the 2021–22 NHL season[update]) is the third-best in the NHL, behind only the Vegas Golden Knights and Montreal Canadiens.[4] Additionally, the Flyers have the most appearances in the conference finals of all 24 expansion teams (16 appearances, winning 8), and they are second behind the St. Louis Blues for the most playoff appearances out of all expansion teams (40 out of 54 seasons).[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Flyers began the 1979–80 season with a somewhat controversial move by naming Clarke a playing assistant coach and giving the captaincy to Mel Bridgman. While Clarke was against this initially, he accepted his new role. The Flyers went undefeated for a North American professional sports record 35-straight games (25–0–10), before losing 7–1 to the Minnesota North Stars, a record that still stands to this day.[28] The streak started after the team was 1–1 on October 14, and ended on January 7, 1980.[29] In doing so, the Flyers wrapped up the Patrick Division title with 14 games to spare and the first overall seed in the playoffs. Their regular season success continued into the playoffs, as the Flyers swept a young Wayne Gretzky and his Edmonton Oilers in the first round, then went on to get revenge against Fred \"The Fog\" Shero and his Rangers by beating them in five before disposing of Minnesota in five to lock up a berth in the Stanley Cup Finals. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n70. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** ***n*** ***o*** ***p*** ***q*** \"Flyers History – Flyers Jersey History Gallery\".

However, they fell out of the playoff picture after that streak ended, struggling in the standings and letting other teams get ahead of them.

The Bullies continued their rough-and-tumble ways, led by Dave Schultz's 348 penalty minutes, and reached the top of the West Division with a record of 50–16–12. The return of Parent proved to be of great benefit, as he established himself as one of if not the best goaltender in the league after winning 47 games, a record which stood for 33 years.[26] Since the Flyers, along with Chicago, allowed the fewest goals in the league, Parent also shared the Vezina Trophy with Chicago's Tony Esposito.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Flyers recorded the best record in team history (points-wise) with a record of 51–13–16 and set the record for most consecutive home wins in regulation (20). The LCB line, featuring Reggie Leach at right-wing, Bobby Clarke at center and Bill Barber at left-wing, set an NHL record for goals by a single line with 141 (Leach 61, Clarke 30, Barber 50). Clarke, on his way to a third Hart Trophy, set a club record for points in one season with 119. Heading into the playoffs, the Flyers squeaked past Toronto in seven games and defeated Boston in five games, with Game 5 featuring a five-goal outburst by Leach, the \"Riverton Rifle\", to head to a third-straight appearance in the Stanley Cup Finals. However, the Flyers did not come close to a third straight championship without an injured Bernie Parent, as they ran into an up-and-coming dynasty in Montreal, and were swept in four-straight games.

The team failed to qualify for the playoffs for the first time since the 2006–07 season and only the ninth time in team history. During the off-season, the Flyers used their two contract buyouts allotted by the new league collective bargaining agreement on Bryzgalov and Briere, and signed free agents Mark Streit (four years, $21 million) and Vincent Lecavalier (five years, $22.5 million).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1970–71, the Flyers had bounced back from the previous season and returned to the playoffs, but were swept by the Chicago Blackhawks in the first round. Even though the team had improved their record in his second season behind the bench, head coach Vic Stasiuk was replaced by Fred Shero in the off-season. The team was involved in a three way trade that sent Bernie Parent to the Toronto Maple Leafs while receiving Rick MacLeish from the Boston Bruins. \n\n\n\n### Broad Street Bullies (1971–1981)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n\n\n![](image)Ed Snider, the team's initial co-owner\nBy the time training camp came around, it was clear that Clarke was the team's best player, and he quickly became a fan favorite. His 15 goals and 31 assists in his rookie season earned him a trip to the NHL All-Star Game. Despite his arrival, the team struggled in 1969–70, recording only 17 wins – the fewest in franchise history and set the NHL team record for most ties in a season (24). They lost the tiebreaker for the final playoff spot to the Oakland Seals, missing the playoffs for the first time.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n53. **^** \"Flyers acquire defenseman Rasmus Ristolainen from Sabres\". *NHL.com*.

Bobby Clarke continued to progress as he led the team in scoring in 1971–72 and became the first Flyer to win an NHL award, the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy for perseverance, sportsmanship and dedication to hockey. However, in the season's final game, the Flyers needed a win or a tie against the second-year Buffalo Sabres to beat out Pittsburgh for the final playoff spot. The score was tied late in the game, but with just four seconds on the clock, former Flyer Gerry Meehan took a shot from just inside the blue line that eluded Flyers goaltender Doug Favell.[23] The Flyers lost the head-to-head tiebreaker to Pittsburgh and missed the playoffs.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLindros eclipsed the 100-point mark for the first time in 1995–96, gathering 115 points, and LeClair scored 51 goals, as the Flyers repeated as Atlantic Division champs and clinched the top seed in the East. Facing the eighth-seeded Tampa Bay Lightning, the Flyers dropped two of the first three games. They rallied by winning three straight games to win the series. After taking two of the first three games against the Florida Panthers in the second round, the Flyers were defeated in overtime in Game 4 and double-overtime in Game 5. An upstart Florida club with stellar goaltending from John Vanbiesbrouck ended the Flyers' season in Game 6.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Season | GP | W | L | OTL | Pts | GF | GA | Finish | Playoffs\n |\n| 2018–19 | 82 | 37 | 37 | 8 | 82 | 244 | 281 | 6th, Metropolitan | Did not qualify\n |\n| 2019–20 | 69 | 41 | 21 | 7 | 89 | 232 | 196 | 2nd, Metropolitan | Lost in Second Round, 3–4 (Islanders)\n |\n| 2020–21 | 56 | 25 | 23 | 8 | 58 | 163 | 201 | 6th, East | Did not qualify\n |\n| 2021–22 | 82 | 25 | 46 | 11 | 61 | 211 | 298 | 8th, Metropolitan | Did not qualify\n |\n| 2022–23 | 82 | 31 | 38 | 13 | 75 | 222 | 277 | 7th, Metropolitan | Did not qualify\n |\n\n\n### Statistical leaders[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Philadelphia Flyers players and List of Philadelphia Flyers records\n\n#### Scoring[edit]\n\n\nThese are the top-ten regular season point-scorers in franchise history.

They found themselves outside of the playoff picture near the halfway point of the regular season, but a second-half surge, including a combined record of 17–7–5 in February and March, placed them into playoff position. On the second-to-last day of the season, the Flyers clinched the final wild-card playoff berth with a win over Pittsburgh and an Ottawa win over Boston, which consequently eliminated the Bruins from playoff contention. The Flyers faced Washington in the first round, losing the first three games of the series.

The 1996–97 season started off slowly, as Lindros missed 30 games, but LeClair still managed to score 50 goals for the second consecutive year, while the mid-season acquisition of defenseman Paul Coffey gave the Flyers a veteran presence.[32] Despite finishing just one point shy of a third straight Atlantic Division title, the Flyers blitzed their way through the first three rounds of the playoffs, dominating Pittsburgh, Buffalo and the Rangers all in five games apiece to win the Eastern Conference championship, and clinch a berth in the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time since 1986–87. Despite having home-ice advantage, the Flyers were swept in four-straight games by the Detroit Red Wings. The goaltending tandem of Hextall and Garth Snow fared poorly in the Finals, as both conceded soft goals, and Murray's strategy of alternating starters in goal was criticized. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Pacific Division\n |\n| --- |\n| Anaheim Ducks\n |\n| Calgary Flames\n |\n| Edmonton Oilers\n |\n| Los Angeles Kings\n |\n| San Jose Sharks\n |\n| Seattle Kraken\n |\n| Vancouver Canucks\n |\n| Vegas Golden Knights\n |\n\n | \n\n| Central Division\n |\n| --- |\n| Chicago Blackhawks\n |\n| Colorado Avalanche\n |\n| Dallas Stars\n |\n| Minnesota Wild\n |\n| Nashville Predators\n |\n| St. Louis Blues\n |\n| Utah NHL team\n |\n| Winnipeg Jets\n |\n\n | \n\n| Atlantic Division\n |\n| --- |\n| Boston Bruins\n |\n| Buffalo Sabres\n |\n| Detroit Red Wings\n |\n| Florida Panthers\n |\n| Montreal Canadiens\n |\n| Ottawa Senators\n |\n| Tampa Bay Lightning\n |\n| Toronto Maple Leafs\n |\n\n | \n\n| Metropolitan Division\n |\n| --- |\n| Carolina Hurricanes\n |\n| Columbus Blue Jackets\n |\n| New Jersey Devils\n |\n| New York Islanders\n |\n| New York Rangers\n |\n| Philadelphia Flyers\n |\n| Pittsburgh Penguins\n |\n| Washington Capitals\n |\n\n |\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith the NHL preparing for looming labor unrest, the Flyers let their leading scorer, Mark Recchi, left for Pittsburgh during the off-season. Unsure about the future, the Flyers were unsure about his worth. The NHL lockout forced the cancellation of the 2004–05 NHL season. The Flyers were one of the more active teams once the NHL lockout came to an end. Replacing the high-profile names of Amonte, LeClair and Roenick were superstar Peter Forsberg, along with defensemen Derian Hatcher and Mike Rathje, as well as several players from the Calder Cup-winning Philadelphia Phantoms. When all was said and done, the team had experienced a turnover of nearly two-thirds of the roster.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Flyers entered the postseason \"bubble\" in Toronto as the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference, meaning they had clinched a playoff appearance and were to play in a seeding round-robin between the top 4 teams of the conference. The Flyers beat the Bruins in the first game 4–1, the Capitals in the second game 3–1, and the Lightning in the third game 4–1 to claim the number 1 seed in the Eastern Conference for the first time since the 1999–2000 season. Despite high expectations after sweeping the round-robin play, going 0 for 11 on the power play was a detriment to the team's play.[50] Regardless, they went into the first round against the 12-seed Canadiens, who had beat the 5-seed Penguins in the qualifying series, with much confidence. The Flyers jumped to a 3–1 series lead behind young goalie Carter Hart, who recorded two consecutive shutouts in Games 3 and 4. Montreal won Game 5 to extend their season, but the Flyers went on to win the series in six games. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFacing Buffalo in the Stanley Cup Finals, the Flyers won the first two games at home. Game 3, played in Buffalo, went down in hockey lore as \"The Fog Game\" due to an unusual May heatwave in Buffalo that forced parts of the game to be played in heavy fog, as Buffalo's arena lacked air conditioning. The Flyers lost Games 3 and 4, but won Game 5 at home in dominating fashion, 5–1. On the road for Game 6, Bob Kelly scored the decisive goal and Parent pitched another shutout (a playoff record fifth shutout) as the Flyers repeated as Stanley Cup champions. Parent also repeated as the playoff MVP, winning a second consecutive Conn Smythe Trophy.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 1989–90 season got off to a bad start for the Flyers, and continued to get worse. Hextall missed all but eight games due to suspension for attacking Chris Chelios at the end of the Montreal playoff series the previous spring, contract holdout issues, and injury. Holmgren replaced Dave Poulin as captain in December with Ron Sutter, which led to Poulin's (and later that season, Brian Propp's) trade to Boston. As a result, the Flyers missed the Stanley Cup playoffs for the first time since 1972. Bobby Clarke, having been with the Flyers organization since he was drafted in 1969, was fired and replaced as general manager by Russ Farwell.\n\n\nRon Hextall continued to be hampered by injuries during the 1990–91 season. He only played in 36 games and as a result the Flyers missed the playoffs for the second consecutive year, finishing fifth in the Division and three points short of a playoff spot after a late-season collapse.\n\n\n\n### Rebuilding years (1991–1994)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Eric Lindros trade\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn June 1992, the Flyers persuaded Bobby Clarke to return to the team as senior vice president after Jay Snider won the hard-fought arbitration battle for 1991 first overall pick Eric Lindros against the Rangers. It was determined that Quebec had made a deal with the Flyers before making a deal with the Rangers. In order to acquire Lindros' rights, the Flyers parted with six players, trading Steve Duchesne, Peter Forsberg, Ron Hextall, Kerry Huffman, Mike Ricci, Chris Simon, a 1993 first-round draft pick (Jocelyn Thibault), a 1994 first-round draft pick (Nolan Baumgartner) and $15 million to Quebec. While Lindros became a preeminent star in Philadelphia, the trade proved heavily lopsided in favor of the Nordiques – soon to become the Colorado Avalanche – providing the core of their two Stanley Cup teams and an unprecedented eight-straight division championships, with Forsberg becoming a franchise player.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n99. **^** \"Jason Smith Named Flyers Captain\".

The Flyers pulled off the upset in six games against a heavily favored Pittsburgh team. In the second round against New Jersey, the Flyers were heavily favored to win the series, but the Flyers' run-and-gun style of play was stymied by the Devils' forechecking and defense, and, although they won the first game at home in overtime, the Flyers lost four games in a row and were eliminated in five. Briere and Giroux ended the playoffs tied with five other players for the League lead in playoff goals with eight, despite their team being eliminated in the second round.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe elder Snider had decided he had seen enough of Farwell as general manager, and began courting Bobby Clarke to leave his general manager post with Florida to return to Philadelphia. Farwell's last move as general manager was firing Simpson after a lackluster performance. Clarke returned to the general manager position prior to the lockout-shortened 1994–95 season and immediately began putting his stamp on the team. New head coach Terry Murray replaced Kevin Dineen as team captain with Lindros prior to the start of training camp. In order to shore up the defense, Ron Hextall was re-acquired from the Islanders and high-scoring winger Recchi was traded to Montreal for Eric Desjardins, Gilbert Dionne and John LeClair early in the abbreviated season.\n\n\n\n![](image)Eric Lindros played for the Flyers from 1992–93 to 1999–2000.\n#### Legion of Doom (1994-1997)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe season began in the image of the *Broad Street Bullies* era, with multiple-game suspensions handed out to five separate players, the most serious being 25-game suspensions to both Steve Downie and Jesse Boulerice for two separate incidents. A 7–3 start in October and a 9–3–1 January run had the Flyers near the top of both the Division and Conference standings. However, a disastrous ten-game losing streak in February, reminiscent of such a streak the previous season, nearly derailed the Flyers' year. An 8–3–4 run in March, coupled with two huge wins over New Jersey and Pittsburgh over the final weekend of the regular season, put the Flyers back in the 2008 playoffs as the sixth seed, setting up a first-round matchup with Washington. After taking a three-game-to-one lead over the Capitals, Washington then won Games 5 and 6 to force a deciding Game 7 in Washington. After an evenly fought game, the Flyers ultimately won the series in overtime via a Joffrey Lupul powerplay goal. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 1999: Maxime Ouellet (22nd overall)\n* 2000: Justin Williams (28th overall)\n* 2001: Jeff Woywitka (27th overall)\n* 2002: Joni Pitkanen (4th overall)\n* 2003: Jeff Carter (11th overall) & Mike Richards (24th overall)\n* 2004: None\n* 2005: Steve Downie (29th overall)\n* 2006: Claude Giroux (22nd overall)\n* 2007: James van Riemsdyk (2nd overall)\n* 2008: Luca Sbisa (19th overall)\n* 2009: None\n* 2010: None\n* 2011: Sean Couturier (8th overall)\n* 2012: Scott Laughton (20th overall)\n* 2013: Samuel Morin (11th overall)\n* 2014: Travis Sanheim (17th overall)\n* 2015: Ivan Provorov (7th overall) & Travis Konecny (24th overall)\n* 2016: German Rubtsov (22nd overall)\n* 2017: Nolan Patrick (2nd overall) & Morgan Frost (27th overall)\n* 2018: Joel Farabee (14th overall) & Jay O'Brien (19th overall)\n* 2019: Cam York (14th overall)\n* 2020: Tyson Foerster (23rd overall)\n* 2021: None\n* 2022: Cutter Gauthier (5th overall)\n* 2023: Matvei Michkov (7th overall) & Oliver Bonk (22nd overall)\n\n### Honored members[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDespite finishing at the .500 mark in 1988–89, the Flyers made the playoffs for the 17th consecutive season. Facing first-place Washington in the first round, the Flyers pulled off the upset in six games. Ron Hextall managed to score another empty-net goal in the waning moments of Game 5, becoming the first NHL goalie to score a goal in the playoffs. The Flyers then defeated Pittsburgh in seven games to make the Wales Conference Finals before bowing out to Montreal in six games.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the Eastern Conference Finals, the Flyers had home-ice advantage as they faced eighth-seeded Montreal. Leighton became the first Flyers netminder to record three shutouts in a series, and Carter and Laperriere returned to the lineup as the Flyers won the Eastern Conference Championship in five games, advancing to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time since 1997 to face the Chicago Blackhawks. Dropping two close games in Chicago, the Flyers returned home to win Game 3 in overtime and Game 4 to even the series. A convincing 7–4 win by Chicago in Game 5, however, put the Flyers one game away from elimination. A late Scott Hartnell goal in Game 6 forced overtime, but Patrick Kane scored just over four minutes into overtime to eliminate the Flyers and give Chicago their first Stanley Cup since 1961. Ville Leino, acquired in a mid-season trade from Detroit, set the Flyers rookie playoff scoring record and tied the NHL record with 21 points. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* National Constitution Center\n* National Liberty Museum\n* National Museum of American Jewish History\n* Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts\n* Philadelphia History Museum\n* Philadelphia Museum of Art\n* Philadelphia's Magic Gardens\n* Please Touch Museum\n* Powel House\n* RittenhouseTown\n* Rodin Museum\n* Rosenbach Museum and Library\n* Ryerss Museum and Library\n* Science History Institute\n* Shofuso Japanese House and Garden\n* Stenton\n* Thaddeus Kosciuszko National Memorial\n* Penn Museum\n* Wagner Free Institute of Science\n* Woodmere Art Museum\n* Wyck House\n |\n| Sports | * 76ers\n* Eagles\n* Flyers\n* Freedoms\n* Phillies\n* Union\n |\n| Squares | * Centre\n* Franklin\n* Logan\n* Rittenhouse\n* Washington\n |\n| Related | * Delaware Valley\n* Carpenters' Hall\n* Independence Hall\n* Congress Hall\n* Liberty Bell\n* Syng inkstand\n* SS *United States*\n* 2016 Democratic National Convention\n |\n| * ![](image) Category\n* ![](image) Portal\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 1967: Serge Bernier (5th overall)\n* 1968: Lew Morrison (8th overall)\n* 1969: Bob Currier (6th overall)\n* 1970: None\n* 1971: Larry Wright (8th overall) & Pierre Plante (9th overall)\n* 1972: Bill Barber (7th overall)\n* 1973: None\n* 1974: None\n* 1975: Mel Bridgman (1st overall)\n* 1976: Mark Suzor (17th overall)\n* 1977: Kevin McCarthy (17th overall)\n* 1978: Behn Wilson (6th overall) & Ken Linseman (7th overall) & Danny Lucas (14th overall)\n* 1979: Brian Propp (14th overall)\n* 1980: Mike Stothers (21st overall)\n* 1981: Steve Smith (16th overall)\n* 1982: Ron Sutter (4th overall)\n* 1983: None\n* 1984: None\n* 1985: Glen Seabrooke (21st overall)\n* 1986: Kerry Huffman (20th overall)\n* 1987: Darren Rumble (20th overall)\n* 1988: Claude Boivin (14th overall)\n* 1989: None\n* 1990: Mike Ricci (4th overall)\n* 1991: Peter Forsberg (6th overall)\n* 1992: Ryan Sittler (7th overall)\n* 1993: None\n* 1994: None\n* 1995: Brian Boucher (22nd overall)\n* 1996: Dainius Zubrus (15th overall)\n* 1997: None\n* 1998: Simon Gagne (22nd overall)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWith Lindros out indefinitely, the Flyers rallied to overcome the distractions and a 15-point deficit in the standings to win the Atlantic Division and the top seed in the East on the last day of the regular season. They easily defeated their first-round opponent, Buffalo, in five games. Primeau's goal in the fifth overtime of Game 4 against the team's second-round opponent, Pittsburgh, turned that series in the Flyers' favor as they won in six games, coming back from a 2–0 series deficit. After dropping Game 1 to New Jersey in the Eastern Conference Finals, the Flyers won three-straight games to take a 3–1 series lead. However, New Jersey won game 5. In Game 6, Lindros returned to the lineup for the first time since March in another losing effort. Early in Game 7, Lindros was handed another concussion and leaving the Philadelphia crowd deflated after being on the receiving end of a controversial hit by Scott Stevens. Without him, the Flyers lost the decisive game 2–1. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUnder the 1974–75 season, Dave Schultz topped his mark from the previous season by setting an NHL record for penalty minutes with 472. Clarke's efforts earned him his second Hart Trophy and Parent was the lone recipient of the Vezina Trophy. The Flyers as a team improved their record slightly with a mark of 51–18–11, the best record in the NHL. After a first-round bye, the Flyers easily swept the Toronto Maple Leafs and were presented with another New York-area team in the semi-finals, the New York Islanders. The Flyers looked to be headed toward another sweep after winning the first three games. However, the Islanders fought back by winning the next three games, setting up a deciding seventh game. The Flyers were finally able to shut the door on the Islanders, winning Game 7, 4–1.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMany NHL teams started using third jerseys during the mid-1990s and the Flyers unveiled a black third jersey that was similar in design to their second-generation jerseys during the 1997–98 season. During the 2000 Stanley Cup playoffs, the black jersey became the primary dark jersey with the orange jersey being retired after the 2000–01 season (although it was worn for one final game early in the following season on Halloween night). In 2002–03, a new orange third jersey was introduced which was a radical departure from any jersey the Flyers had used before. Unique striping and fonts were used along with the aforementioned metallic 3D logo and the first use of a color other than orange, black or white on a Flyers jersey – silver/gray. These jerseys were used until the end of the 2006–07 season.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHowever, lackluster play throughout March and April, coupled with a broken hand suffered by Chris Pronger in late February that ended his regular season, cost the Flyers the top seed in the East during the last week of the regular season, although the Flyers hung on to win their first Atlantic Division title since 2003–04 and clinched the second seed in the East.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Bill Barber\n* Bobby Clarke\n* Paul Coffey\n* Peter Forsberg\n* Dale Hawerchuk\n* Mark Howe\n* Eric Lindros\n* Adam Oates\n* Bernie Parent\n* Chris Pronger\n* Mark Recchi\n* Darryl Sittler\n* Allan Stanley\n\n**Builders**\n\n\n\n* Keith Allen\n* Ken Hitchcock\n* Roger Neilson\n* Bud Poile\n* Pat Quinn\n* Fred Shero\n* Ed Snider\n\n#### Retired numbers[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of NHL retired numbers\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Flyers initially struggled out of the gate, going only 3–7–1 through their first 11 games while being outscored 34–22. Lindros and LeClair then teamed with Renberg to form the Legion of Doom line, a mix of scoring talent and physical intimidation. In their 37 games (including the 3–1 victory on February 11, 1995, against the New Jersey Devils), the Flyers went 25–9–3 and outscored their opponents 128–98 en route. Lindros tied Jaromir Jagr for the regular season scoring lead (though Jagr won the Art Ross Trophy with more goals), and captured the Hart Memorial Trophy as the league's MVP. The playoff drought came to an end as the Flyers won their first division title in eight years and clinched the second seed in the Eastern Conference. After dispatching Buffalo in five and sweeping the defending Stanley Cup champion Rangers, the Flyers were upset in the Eastern Conference Finals to the eventual Stanley Cup champion New Jersey Devils in six games.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Flyers would go on to win over the Penguins again in the 2000 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals, most remembered for Keith Primeau scoring the game winning goal in the fifth overtime period of game four, becoming the third longest playoff game in league history with a total game time of 152 minutes. The Penguins first playoff victory against the Flyers came during the 2008 Eastern Conference Finals, winning the series in five games to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals. The two teams would meet again in the playoffs the following year in the 2009 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals, with the Penguins defeating the Flyers in six games. The rivalry would come to a boiling point during the 2012 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals when both teams combined for an NHL record 45 goals in the first four games of a playoff series, as well as accumulating 309 penalty minutes. Game three saw a total combined 158 penalty minutes between the two teams, as well as multiple suspensions. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n136. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Apody, Jamie (December 6, 2021). \"Flyers fire head coach Alain Vigneault following 8 straight losses\". *6abc Philadelphia*.

With Hextall providing the critical stops at crucial times, the Flyers captured a third-straight Patrick Division title, and were able to gain revenge on the Rangers by beating them in six games in the division semifinals, as well as surviving a tough seven-game test from a gritty Islanders club, in the division finals. The Flyers then defeated the defending Stanley Cup champion Canadiens in a fiery six-game series (notable for a famous bench-clearing brawl during the Game 6 warmup) to win the Wales Conference and return to the Stanley Cup Finals. As was the case two seasons prior, the Flyers became decimated by injuries, the most significant of which was losing Kerr for the remainder of the playoffs. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)In 1996, the Flyers moved to their present home arena, the CoreStates Center (now the Wells Fargo Center).\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n114. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"SPORTS PEOPLE; 2 Coaches Out\". *The New York Times*.

Despite being hampered by injuries prior to and during the season, the Flyers lived up to those expectations in the first half of the season, reaching the top of the league standings in January while simultaneously holding a 10-point lead in the Atlantic Division. The *Deuces Wild* line of Forsberg, Gagne, and Mike Knuble recorded 75, 79 and 65 points respectively while Gagne, with Forsberg feeding him, scored a career-high of 47 goals. However, the injuries began to accumulate and take their toll, the most crippling of which was Keith Primeau's season-ending concussion. Derian Hatcher served as interim captain for the remainder of the season. The Flyers had been first in the league prior to the Olympic break, where an injury to Forsberg occurred. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n78. **^** \"Penguins Pick Up Angotti in 3-Team Trade\". *Chicago Tribune*.

The number 31, last worn by goaltender Pelle Lindbergh, was removed from circulation after Lindbergh's death on November 11, 1985, but it is not officially retired.[153] The NHL retired Wayne Gretzky's No. 99 for all its member teams at the 2000 NHL All-Star Game.[154] In 2018, the Flyers retired Eric Lindros' number 88.[155]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Most goals in a season: Reggie Leach, 61 (1975–76)\n* Most assists in a season: Bobby Clarke, 89 (1974–75 & 1975–76)\n* Most points in a season: Mark Recchi, 123 (1992–93)\n* Most penalty minutes in a season: Dave Schultz, 472 (1974–75) (NHL record)\n* Most points in a season, defenseman: Mark Howe, 82 (1985–86)\n* Most points in a season, rookie: Mikael Renberg, 82 (1993–94)\n* Most wins in a season: Bernie Parent, 47 (1973–74)\n* Most shutouts in a season: Bernie Parent, 12 (1973–74 & 1974–75)\n* Most power play goals in a season: Tim Kerr, 34 (1985–86) (NHL record)\n\n\n#### Playoffs[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFollowing the season, the Flyers were stunned when head coach Shero left to become general manager and head coach of the New York Rangers. As compensation for Shero, the Flyers received the Rangers' first-round draft pick in 1978.\n\n\n\n![](image)Bill Barber played for the Flyers from 1972–73 to 1983–84\nBob McCammon, who had just coached the Flyers' first year American Hockey League (AHL) Maine Mariners farm club to a Calder Cup title, replaced Fred Shero behind the bench. After a slow start in 1978–79, the Flyers switched McCammon with Pat Quinn, Shero's previous assistant coach, who had replaced McCammon with the Mariners. Adding to the problems, Bernie Parent suffered a career-ending eye injury. The Flyers rallied under Quinn and finished in second place. Matched up against the Vancouver Canucks in the preliminary round, the Flyers won the series in three games. The Flyers' season came to an end against Fred Shero's Rangers in a five-game quarterfinal loss.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFlyers general manager Paul Holmgren made two franchise-altering trades within the span of an hour on June 23, 2011, trading Mike Richards to the Los Angeles Kings for Brayden Schenn, Wayne Simmonds and a 2012 second-round draft pick, and Jeff Carter to Columbus for their 2011 first-round pick (with which the Flyers selected Sean Couturier), 2011 third-round pick (with which the Flyers selected Nick Cousins) and Jakub Voracek. Later that same day, Holmgren addressed the Flyers' long-standing goaltending issues by signing the Phoenix Coyotes' Ilya Bryzgalov to a nine-year, $51 million contract. On July 1, the Flyers signed Jaromir Jagr to a one-year contract, Maxime Talbot to a five-year contract and Andreas Lilja to a two-year contract. Additionally, Chris Pronger was named Flyers captain; however, 13 games into the 2011–12 season, he was lost for the remainder of the regular season and playoffs with severe post-concussion syndrome. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Wayne Simmonds played for the Flyers from 2011–12 to 2018–19Despite finishing sixth in their division, they won the second overall pick in the 2017 NHL Entry Draft lottery with just a 2.4% chance to win that particular pick. They used this pick to select Nolan Patrick from the Brandon Wheat Kings. In the 2017–18 season, the Flyers rallied from a 10-game losing streak early in the season to finish in third place in the Metropolitan Division but lost to Pittsburgh in six games in the first round of the 2018 playoffs. They clinched a playoff spot on the last game of the season, at home against the Rangers, winning 5–0 with the help of a Claude Giroux hat trick. In that game, Giroux became the first Flyer to have a 100-point season since Eric Lindros in 1995–96, finishing second in league scoring and fourth in MVP voting, while Couturier was a finalist for the Selke Trophy, and Simmonds was a finalist for the Mark Messier Leadership Award.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAll told, the Flyers were third in the NHL with 388 man-games lost to injury, tops amongst playoff teams.[34] The second half of the regular season was defined by a record hovering around .500, sending the Flyers on a steady slide in the standings. The Flyers fell short of an Atlantic Division title, finishing second by tie-breaker to New Jersey, drawing the fifth seed in the Eastern Conference and a first-round match-up with fourth-seeded Buffalo. The Flyers lost the series in six games.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe trio of Lindros, Recchi and Brent Fedyk formed the Crazy Eights line in Lindros' first two years in the NHL, the eights being the player's jersey numbers (88, 8 and 18 respectively). In 1992–93, Recchi set the franchise record for points in a season with 123 (53 goals and 70 assists) and Lindros scored 41 goals in 61 games. After struggling early, the Flyers made a run at the playoffs, but came four points short of the last spot. Head coach Bill Dineen was fired at the season's end, while Clarke left town again to become general manager of the expansion Florida Panthers.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The Spectrum was the home arena for the Philadelphia Flyers from 1967 to 1996.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Flyers began the 2021–22 season off to a steady pace by winning six out of the first ten games of the season, however once again things would start to fall apart for the team. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### New York Islanders[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Flyers–Islanders rivalry\n\n### New York Rangers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Flyers–Rangers rivalry\n\n### Pittsburgh Penguins[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Flyers–Penguins rivalry\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Flyers unveiled a new uniform design ahead of the 2023–24 season, reverting to the burnt orange shade they wore with the 1984–2007 uniforms. This design featured wider shoulder and sleeve stripes, single-colored sleeve numbers (black on the home uniform, white on the road uniform), and a black bottom stripe, all of which were visual nods to previous Flyers uniforms. The contrasting nameplate was also retained. The black alternate first used in the 2017 Stadium Series was also kept in circulation.[1]\n\n\n\n### Cooperall pants[edit]\n\n\nThe Flyers were the first and one of only two NHL teams (the Hartford Whalers being the other) to wear Cooperalls, hockey pants that extend from the waist to the ankles, in 1981–82. They wore them the following season as well, but returned to the traditional hockey pants in 1983–84 due to Cooperalls being banned from the NHL for safety reasons.\n\n\n\n### Mascots[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Gritty\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDespite holding on to the fourth seed in the East for much of the season, thanks to a 4–5–1 finish to the season, highlighted by a home loss to the Rangers on the last day of the regular season, the Flyers slipped to the fifth seed and lost home-ice advantage in their first-round series with Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh dominated the Flyers in Game 1, and despite a better effort by the Flyers in Game 2, Pittsburgh came to Philadelphia with a 2–0 series lead. The Flyers were the better team in Games 3 and 4, but Pittsburgh gained a split in Philadelphia and took a 3–1 series lead. After a decisive 3–0 win in Game 5, the Flyers jumped out to a 3–0 lead in Game 6, but promptly fell victim to the inconsistencies that plagued the team all season and gave up five unanswered goals in a season-ending 5–3 loss. Giroux led the team in scoring in the playoffs. Jeff Carter ended the regular season with 46 goals, second in the NHL after Washington's Alexander Ovechkin.

Hextall became the first NHL goaltender to score a goal by firing the puck into an empty net in a December 8 game against Boston. In their first-round playoff series with Washington, the Flyers blew a 3–1 series lead as Washington forced a Game 7. They then blew a 3–0 lead in Game 7 as Washington won in overtime 5–4. It was because of this playoff collapse that \"Iron Mike\" was fired. Paul Holmgren was named Keenan's replacement, the first time a former Flyer was named the club's head coach.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe changes did little to improve the Flyers fortunes in 2006–07 as setting franchise records for futility became the norm. They had several multiple-game losing streaks, including a franchise-worst 10-game losing streak and a 13-game home losing streak that stretched from November 29 to February 10. Ultimately, the Flyers finished with a 22–48–12 record, the most losses and the worst winning percentage in franchise history, and the worst record in the league. They also set the NHL record for the biggest points drop off in the standings in a one-year span (101 points in 2005–06 to 56 points in 2006–07, a difference of 45 points). The Flyers lost the NHL draft lottery to the Chicago Blackhawks and received the second overall selection.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPrior to the 1991–92 season, the Flyers acquired Rod Brind'Amour from St. Louis. Brind'Amour led the Flyers in goals (33), assists (44) and points (77) in his first season with the club. With Ron Sutter gone to St. Louis in the Brind'Amour trade, Rick Tocchet was named team captain. As the Flyers continued to flounder, Paul Holmgren was fired midway through the season and replaced by Bill Dineen, father of Flyer Kevin Dineen. On February 19, the Flyers and Pittsburgh made a major five-player deal which featured Tocchet – who never grew comfortably into the role of captain – heading to Pittsburgh and Mark Recchi coming to Philadelphia. Recchi recorded 27 points in his first 22 games as a Flyer, but the team missed the playoffs for the third consecutive year, due in large part to an awful road record (10–26–4). With Tocchet traded, the Flyers remained without a captain until Kevin Dineen was named to the post in 1993–94, and instead went with three alternate captains.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Mark Howe played for the Flyers from 1982–83 to 1991–92\nOver the next three seasons the team would suffer early playoff exits and manage to win only one playoff game during that span. They were eliminated two years in a row in 1981–82 and 1982–83 by the New York Rangers and then were swept by the Washington Capitals in 1983–84. Following the loss to Washington, Bobby Clarke retired from play and was named vice-president and general manager of the team. Mike Keenan, a relative unknown at the time, was hired in 1984 to coach the team, and named second-year player Dave Poulin team captain.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn December 11, 1969, the Flyers introduced what became one of the team's best-known traditions: playing a recording of Kate Smith singing \"God Bless America\" instead of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" before important games. The perception was that the team was more successful on these occasions, so the tradition grew. The move was initially done by Flyers Promotion Director Lou Scheinfeld as a way to defray national tensions at the time of the Vietnam War: Scheinfeld noticed that people regularly left their seats and walked around during the anthem, but showed more respect and often sang along to \"God Bless America\". As of the close of the 2016–17 season, the Flyers have a record of 100–29–5 when \"God Bless America\" was sung prior to Flyers home games.[22]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_Y0buWn3f17ZjQoFJSNlH1fpz","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

The Flyers compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Metropolitan Division in the Eastern Conference.[3] The team plays its home games in Wells Fargo Center in the South Philadelphia Sports Complex, an indoor arena they share with the Philadelphia 76ers of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the Philadelphia Wings of the National Lacrosse League (NLL). Part of the 1967 NHL Expansion, the Flyers are the first of the expansion teams in the post–Original Six era to win the Stanley Cup, victorious in 1973–74 and again in 1974–75.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Quakers' dormant NHL franchise was finally canceled by the league in 1936.[10][11]\n\n\nIn 1946, a group led by Montreal and Philadelphia sportsman Len Peto announced plans to put another NHL team in Philadelphia, to build a $2.5 million rink to seat 20,000 where the Phillies' former ballpark stood at Broad and Huntingdon Streets, and to acquire the franchise of the old Montreal Maroons.[12] The latter was held by the Canadian Arena Company, owner of the Montreal Canadiens. However, Peto's group was unable to raise funding for the new arena project by the league-imposed deadline, and the NHL cancelled the Maroons franchise.[13][14][15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhile attending a basketball game on November 29, 1964, at the Boston Garden, Ed Snider, the then-vice-president of the Philadelphia Eagles, observed a crowd of Boston Bruins fans lining up to purchase tickets to see a last-place ice hockey team.[16] He began making plans for a new arena upon hearing the NHL was looking to expand due to fears of a competing league taking hold on the West Coast and the desire for a new television contract in the United States. Snider made his proposal to the league, which chose the Philadelphia group – including Snider, Bill Putnam, Jerome Schiff and Philadelphia Eagles owner Jerry Wolman – over the Baltimore group.\n\n\nOn April 4, 1966, Putnam announced that there was going to be a name-the-team contest.[17] Details of the contest were released on July 12.[17] The team name was announced on August 3.[17]\n\n\n\n### Early years (1967–1971)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPrior to 1967, Philadelphia had only iced a team in the NHL in the 1930–31 season, when the financially struggling Pittsburgh Pirates relocated in 1930 as the Philadelphia Quakers, playing at The Arena at 46th and Market Streets. The club, garbed in orange and black like today's Flyers, was coached by J. Cooper Smeaton, who was to be elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame 30 years later, for his far more notable role as an NHL referee. Among the young Quakers' skaters in 1930–31 was another future Hall of Famer in 19-year-old rookie center Syd Howe. The Quakers' only \"claim to fame\" was to establish a single season NHL record for futility which has stood ever since, by compiling a dismal record of 4–36–4, still the fewest games ever won in a season by an NHL club. The Quakers quietly suspended operations after that single dreadful campaign to again leave the Can-Am League's Philadelphia Arrows as Philadelphia's lone hockey team. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![Pennsylvania](image) Sports teams based in Pennsylvania\n |\n| --- |\n| Australian Rules Football | USAFL\nPhiladelphia Hawks\n |\n| Baseball | MLB\nPhiladelphia Phillies\nPittsburgh Pirates\nIL\nLehigh Valley IronPigs\nScranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders\nEL\nAltoona Curve\nErie SeaWolves\nHarrisburg Senators\nReading Fightin Phils\nALPB\nLancaster Stormers\nYork Revolution\nMLBDL\nState College Spikes\nWilliamsport Crosscutters\nFL\nWashington Wild Things\nPL\nJohnstown Mill Rats\n |\n| Basketball | NBA\nPhiladelphia 76ers\n |\n| Cricket | * Lehigh Valley Cricket Club\n* Philadelphia Cricket Club\n |\n| Esports | OWL\nPhiladelphia Fusion\n |\n| Football | NFL\nPhiladelphia Eagles\nPittsburgh Steelers\nAFL\nPhiladelphia Soul\nGDFL\nErie Express\nWFA\nPhiladelphia Phantomz\nPittsburgh Passion\n |\n| Ice hockey | NHL\nPhiladelphia Flyers\nPittsburgh Penguins\nAHL\nHershey Bears\nLehigh Valley Phantoms\nWilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins\nECHL\nReading Royals\nOHL\nErie Otters\nNAHL\nJohnstown Tomahawks\nEHL\nPhiladelphia Little Flyers\nPhiladelphia Junior Flyers\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nPhiladelphia Flyers seasons\n |\n| --- |\n| 1960s | * 1960–61 . 1961–62 . 1962–63 . 1963–64 . 1964–66 . 1965–66 . 1966–67 . 1967–68\n* 1968–69\n* 1969–70\n |\n| 1970s | * 1970–71\n* 1971–72\n* 1972–73\n* 1973–74\n* 1974–75\n* 1975–76\n* 1976–77\n* 1977–78\n* 1978–79\n* 1979–80\n |\n| 1980s | * 1980–81\n* 1981–82\n* 1982–83\n* 1983–84\n* 1984–85\n* 1985–86\n* 1986–87\n* 1987–88\n* 1988–89\n* 1989–90\n |\n| 1990s | * 1990–91\n* 1991–92\n* 1992–93\n* 1993–94\n* 1994–95\n* 1995–96\n* 1996–97\n* 1997–98\n* 1998–99\n* 1999–00\n |\n| 2000s | * 2000–01\n* 2001–02\n* 2002–03\n* 2003–04\n* 2004–05\n* 2005–06\n* 2006–07\n* 2007–08\n* 2008–09\n* 2009–10\n |\n| 2010s | * 2010–11\n* 2011–12\n* 2012–13\n* 2013–14\n* 2014–15\n* 2015–16\n* 2016–17\n* 2017–18\n* 2018–19\n* 2019–20\n |\n| 2020s | * 2020–21\n* 2021–22\n* 2022–23\n* 2023–24\n |\n| Highlighted seasons indicate Stanley Cup championship\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNational Hockey League\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Western Conference | Eastern Conference |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNPSL\nAtlantic City FC\nTorch FC\n |\n| Tennis | WTT\nPhiladelphia Freedoms (defunct)\n |\n| Lacrosse | NLL\nPhiladelphia Wings\nPLL\nPhiladelphia Waterdogs\n |\n| Ultimate | AUDL\nPhiladelphia Phoenix\n |\n| College athletics (NCAA Div.

They have also waged lengthy campaigns against the New York Islanders in the 1970s and 1980s, the Boston Bruins in the 1970s and 2010s, the Washington Capitals, since their days in the Patrick Division,[5][6] as well as the New Jersey Devils, with whom they traded the Atlantic Division title every season between 1994–95 and 2006–07, and with their cross-state rivals, the Pittsburgh Penguins, which is considered by many to be the best rivalry in the league.[7][8][9]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### NHL in Philadelphia before 1967[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Bobby Clarke and Bernie Parent, 1988\n* Keith Allen, Bill Barber and Ed Snider, 1989\n* Rick MacLeish and Fred Shero, 1990\n* Barry Ashbee and Gary Dornhoefer, 1991\n* Gene Hart and Reggie Leach, 1992\n* Joe Scott and Ed Van Impe, 1993\n* Tim Kerr, 1994\n* Joe Watson, 1996\n* Brian Propp, 1999\n* Mark Howe, 2001\n* Dave Poulin, 2004\n* Ron Hextall, 2008\n* Dave Schultz, 2009\n* John LeClair and Eric Lindros, 2014\n* Eric Desjardins and Rod Brind'Amour, 2015\n* Jimmy Watson, 2016\n* Rick Tocchet and Paul Holmgren, 2021\n\n## Team records[edit]\n\n\nStatistics and records are current after the **2021–22 season**, except where noted.\n\n\n\n### Season-by-season record[edit]\n\n\n*This is a partial list of the last five seasons completed by the Flyers.

The first two were the names of previous Philadelphia hockey teams and – given the connotations of losing (Quakers) and the minor leagues (Ramblers) – were passed over.

In the 1972–73 season the Flyers got rid of the mediocre expansion team label and instead became the intimidating \"Broad Street Bullies\", a nickname coined by Jack Chevalier and Pete Cafone of the *Philadelphia Bulletin* on January 3, 1973,[24] after a 3–1 brawling victory over the Atlanta Flames that led Chevalier to write in his game account, \"The image of the fightin' Flyers spreading gradually around the NHL, and people are dreaming up wild nicknames. They're the Mean Machine, the Bullies of Broad Street and Freddy's Philistines.\" Cafone wrote the accompanying headline: \"Broad Street Bullies Muscle Atlanta.\"[25] That same month, Clarke was the youngest player (at that time) in NHL history to be named team captain, replacing Ed Van Impe. Rick MacLeish became the first Flyer to score 50 goals in a season and the Flyers recorded their first winning season.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDespite having lost in the playoffs, the team had very high expectations entering the 2020–21 season.

NHL divisions would be temporarily realigned due to travel restrictions, placing the Flyers in the East Division.[51] The team managed to finish the first month of play tied for first place in the league, with a 7–2–1 record. However things began to unravel as the season continued. The team fell out of playoff contention by early March and would finish the season with the most goals scored against in the league. Management vowed to address the issues the team had suffered during the season by making several trades and free agent signings. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Bobby Clarke played for the Flyers from 1969–70 to 1983–84\nTheir opponent, Bobby Orr and the Boston Bruins, took Game 1 in Boston, but Bobby Clarke scored an overtime goal in Game 2 to even the series. The Flyers then won Games 3 and 4 at home to take a 3–1 series lead, though Boston won Game 5 to stave off elimination. That set the stage for Game 6 at the Spectrum. Kate Smith appeared in person before Game 6 to sing her rendition of \"God Bless America\", even miming a \"knockout punch\" after her performance. The Flyers picked up the lead early when Rick MacLeish scored a first-period goal. Late in the game, Orr hauled down Clarke on a breakaway, a penalty which assured the Flyers of victory. Time expired as the Flyers brought the Stanley Cup to Philadelphia for the first time. Parent, having shutout Boston in Game 6, won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the MVP of the playoffs.\n\n\n\n#### 1974–75 Stanley Cup champions[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCome playoff time, the Flyers swept the Atlanta Flames in four games in the first round. In the Semi-finals, the Flyers faced the New York Rangers. The series, which saw the home team win every game, went seven games. Fortunately for the Flyers, they had home-ice advantage as they advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals by winning Game 7 and in the process made history by becoming the first expansion team to win a playoff series over an Original Six team.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSee also: List of Philadelphia Flyers players and List of Philadelphia Flyers award winners\n\n#### Hall of Fame[edit]\n\n\nThe Philadelphia Flyers recognize an affiliation with a number of inductees to the Hockey Hall of Fame, including 13 former players and six builders of the sport. The six individuals recognized as builders by the Hall of Fame includes former general managers, head coaches, and owners.[148] Inducted in 1984, Bernie Parent was the first Flyers-affiliated player to be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame.[148]\n\n\nIn addition to players and builders, members of Philadelphia's sports media have also been recognized by the Hockey Hall of Fame. In 1997, Gene Hart, a sports announcer for the Flyers, received the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award from the Hockey Hall of Fame for his contributions to hockey broadcasting.[149] In 2013, Jay Greenberg of the *Philadelphia Daily News* was awarded the Elmer Ferguson Memorial Award for his work in hockey journalism.[150]\n\n\n**Players**\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Flyers Unveil New Uniforms Featuring Burnt Orange for 2023-24 season\". *PhiladelphiaFlyers.com*.

The Flyers lost their hold on the Patrick Division in 1977–78 and settled for second place. After sweeping the Colorado Rockies in two games in the preliminary round, the Flyers moved on to beat Buffalo in five games.

However, they could not overcome the odds a third time and eventually succumbed to the Oilers, 3–1, in Game 7. Hextall was voted playoff MVP, the second time a Flyer won the Conn Smythe Trophy despite being on the losing team (the other being another Manitoban, Reggie Leach, in 1976).[31]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAlso known as the Battle of Pennsylvania, the Flyers-Penguins rivalry is considered by many to be one of the most intense rivalries in the NHL. Both teams entered the league in 1967 with the Flyers finding success in the league early on while the Penguins struggled in the early years. The Flyers record against the Penguins from 1967 to 1989 was 89–36–19, and most notably during this time the Penguins had a 42 game winless streak at the Spectrum, lasting from 1974 until 1989. The two teams met for the first time in the playoffs in the 1989 Patrick Division Finals, where the Flyers defeated the higher seeded Penguins in seven games. The teams faced each other again in the 1997 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals, with the Flyers winning the series in five games. Penguins legend Mario Lemieux decided to retire at the end of the series for the first time and left the ice to a standing ovation in Philadelphia after game five. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPhiladelphia Flyers retired numbers\n| No.\n | Player\n | Position\n | Career\n | Date of retirement\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Bernie Parent | Goaltender | 1967–1971, 1973–1979 | October 11, 1979 |\n| 2 | Mark Howe | Defense | 1982–1992 | March 6, 2012 |\n| 4 | Barry Ashbee | Defense | 1970–1974 | October 13, 1977[151][156] |\n| 7 | Bill Barber | Left Wing | 1972–1984 | October 11, 1990 |\n| 16 | Bobby Clarke | Center | 1969–1984 | November 15, 1984 |\n| 88 | Eric Lindros | Center | 1992–2000 | January 18, 2018[155] |\n\n\n#### Flyers Hall of Fame[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of Philadelphia Flyers award winners § Flyers Hall of Fame\n\nEstablished in 1988, the Flyers Hall of Fame was designed to \"permanently honor those individuals who have contributed to the franchise's success.\"[157] Candidates for the hall are nominated and voted upon by a panel of media members and team officials.[157] To date, 27 former players and executives have been inducted.[158]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Flyers' all-time points percentage of 57.1% (as of the 2021–22 NHL season[update]) is the third-best in the NHL, behind only the Vegas Golden Knights and Montreal Canadiens.[4] Additionally, the Flyers have the most appearances in the conference finals of all 24 expansion teams (16 appearances, winning 8), and they are second behind the St. Louis Blues for the most playoff appearances out of all expansion teams (40 out of 54 seasons).[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Flyers began the 1979–80 season with a somewhat controversial move by naming Clarke a playing assistant coach and giving the captaincy to Mel Bridgman. While Clarke was against this initially, he accepted his new role. The Flyers went undefeated for a North American professional sports record 35-straight games (25–0–10), before losing 7–1 to the Minnesota North Stars, a record that still stands to this day.[28] The streak started after the team was 1–1 on October 14, and ended on January 7, 1980.[29] In doing so, the Flyers wrapped up the Patrick Division title with 14 games to spare and the first overall seed in the playoffs. Their regular season success continued into the playoffs, as the Flyers swept a young Wayne Gretzky and his Edmonton Oilers in the first round, then went on to get revenge against Fred \"The Fog\" Shero and his Rangers by beating them in five before disposing of Minnesota in five to lock up a berth in the Stanley Cup Finals. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n70. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** ***n*** ***o*** ***p*** ***q*** \"Flyers History – Flyers Jersey History Gallery\".

However, they fell out of the playoff picture after that streak ended, struggling in the standings and letting other teams get ahead of them.

The Bullies continued their rough-and-tumble ways, led by Dave Schultz's 348 penalty minutes, and reached the top of the West Division with a record of 50–16–12. The return of Parent proved to be of great benefit, as he established himself as one of if not the best goaltender in the league after winning 47 games, a record which stood for 33 years.[26] Since the Flyers, along with Chicago, allowed the fewest goals in the league, Parent also shared the Vezina Trophy with Chicago's Tony Esposito.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Flyers recorded the best record in team history (points-wise) with a record of 51–13–16 and set the record for most consecutive home wins in regulation (20). The LCB line, featuring Reggie Leach at right-wing, Bobby Clarke at center and Bill Barber at left-wing, set an NHL record for goals by a single line with 141 (Leach 61, Clarke 30, Barber 50). Clarke, on his way to a third Hart Trophy, set a club record for points in one season with 119. Heading into the playoffs, the Flyers squeaked past Toronto in seven games and defeated Boston in five games, with Game 5 featuring a five-goal outburst by Leach, the \"Riverton Rifle\", to head to a third-straight appearance in the Stanley Cup Finals. However, the Flyers did not come close to a third straight championship without an injured Bernie Parent, as they ran into an up-and-coming dynasty in Montreal, and were swept in four-straight games.

Bobby Clarke continued to progress as he led the team in scoring in 1971–72 and became the first Flyer to win an NHL award, the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy for perseverance, sportsmanship and dedication to hockey. However, in the season's final game, the Flyers needed a win or a tie against the second-year Buffalo Sabres to beat out Pittsburgh for the final playoff spot. The score was tied late in the game, but with just four seconds on the clock, former Flyer Gerry Meehan took a shot from just inside the blue line that eluded Flyers goaltender Doug Favell.[23] The Flyers lost the head-to-head tiebreaker to Pittsburgh and missed the playoffs.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLindros eclipsed the 100-point mark for the first time in 1995–96, gathering 115 points, and LeClair scored 51 goals, as the Flyers repeated as Atlantic Division champs and clinched the top seed in the East. Facing the eighth-seeded Tampa Bay Lightning, the Flyers dropped two of the first three games. They rallied by winning three straight games to win the series. After taking two of the first three games against the Florida Panthers in the second round, the Flyers were defeated in overtime in Game 4 and double-overtime in Game 5. An upstart Florida club with stellar goaltending from John Vanbiesbrouck ended the Flyers' season in Game 6.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Season | GP | W | L | OTL | Pts | GF | GA | Finish | Playoffs\n |\n| 2018–19 | 82 | 37 | 37 | 8 | 82 | 244 | 281 | 6th, Metropolitan | Did not qualify\n |\n| 2019–20 | 69 | 41 | 21 | 7 | 89 | 232 | 196 | 2nd, Metropolitan | Lost in Second Round, 3–4 (Islanders)\n |\n| 2020–21 | 56 | 25 | 23 | 8 | 58 | 163 | 201 | 6th, East | Did not qualify\n |\n| 2021–22 | 82 | 25 | 46 | 11 | 61 | 211 | 298 | 8th, Metropolitan | Did not qualify\n |\n| 2022–23 | 82 | 31 | 38 | 13 | 75 | 222 | 277 | 7th, Metropolitan | Did not qualify\n |\n\n\n### Statistical leaders[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Philadelphia Flyers players and List of Philadelphia Flyers records\n\n#### Scoring[edit]\n\n\nThese are the top-ten regular season point-scorers in franchise history.

They found themselves outside of the playoff picture near the halfway point of the regular season, but a second-half surge, including a combined record of 17–7–5 in February and March, placed them into playoff position. On the second-to-last day of the season, the Flyers clinched the final wild-card playoff berth with a win over Pittsburgh and an Ottawa win over Boston, which consequently eliminated the Bruins from playoff contention. The Flyers faced Washington in the first round, losing the first three games of the series.

The 1996–97 season started off slowly, as Lindros missed 30 games, but LeClair still managed to score 50 goals for the second consecutive year, while the mid-season acquisition of defenseman Paul Coffey gave the Flyers a veteran presence.[32] Despite finishing just one point shy of a third straight Atlantic Division title, the Flyers blitzed their way through the first three rounds of the playoffs, dominating Pittsburgh, Buffalo and the Rangers all in five games apiece to win the Eastern Conference championship, and clinch a berth in the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time since 1986–87. Despite having home-ice advantage, the Flyers were swept in four-straight games by the Detroit Red Wings. The goaltending tandem of Hextall and Garth Snow fared poorly in the Finals, as both conceded soft goals, and Murray's strategy of alternating starters in goal was criticized. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Pacific Division\n |\n| --- |\n| Anaheim Ducks\n |\n| Calgary Flames\n |\n| Edmonton Oilers\n |\n| Los Angeles Kings\n |\n| San Jose Sharks\n |\n| Seattle Kraken\n |\n| Vancouver Canucks\n |\n| Vegas Golden Knights\n |\n\n | \n\n| Central Division\n |\n| --- |\n| Chicago Blackhawks\n |\n| Colorado Avalanche\n |\n| Dallas Stars\n |\n| Minnesota Wild\n |\n| Nashville Predators\n |\n| St. Louis Blues\n |\n| Utah NHL team\n |\n| Winnipeg Jets\n |\n\n | \n\n| Atlantic Division\n |\n| --- |\n| Boston Bruins\n |\n| Buffalo Sabres\n |\n| Detroit Red Wings\n |\n| Florida Panthers\n |\n| Montreal Canadiens\n |\n| Ottawa Senators\n |\n| Tampa Bay Lightning\n |\n| Toronto Maple Leafs\n |\n\n | \n\n| Metropolitan Division\n |\n| --- |\n| Carolina Hurricanes\n |\n| Columbus Blue Jackets\n |\n| New Jersey Devils\n |\n| New York Islanders\n |\n| New York Rangers\n |\n| Philadelphia Flyers\n |\n| Pittsburgh Penguins\n |\n| Washington Capitals\n |\n\n |\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith the NHL preparing for looming labor unrest, the Flyers let their leading scorer, Mark Recchi, left for Pittsburgh during the off-season. Unsure about the future, the Flyers were unsure about his worth. The NHL lockout forced the cancellation of the 2004–05 NHL season. The Flyers were one of the more active teams once the NHL lockout came to an end. Replacing the high-profile names of Amonte, LeClair and Roenick were superstar Peter Forsberg, along with defensemen Derian Hatcher and Mike Rathje, as well as several players from the Calder Cup-winning Philadelphia Phantoms. When all was said and done, the team had experienced a turnover of nearly two-thirds of the roster.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Flyers entered the postseason \"bubble\" in Toronto as the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference, meaning they had clinched a playoff appearance and were to play in a seeding round-robin between the top 4 teams of the conference. The Flyers beat the Bruins in the first game 4–1, the Capitals in the second game 3–1, and the Lightning in the third game 4–1 to claim the number 1 seed in the Eastern Conference for the first time since the 1999–2000 season. Despite high expectations after sweeping the round-robin play, going 0 for 11 on the power play was a detriment to the team's play.[50] Regardless, they went into the first round against the 12-seed Canadiens, who had beat the 5-seed Penguins in the qualifying series, with much confidence. The Flyers jumped to a 3–1 series lead behind young goalie Carter Hart, who recorded two consecutive shutouts in Games 3 and 4. Montreal won Game 5 to extend their season, but the Flyers went on to win the series in six games. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFacing Buffalo in the Stanley Cup Finals, the Flyers won the first two games at home. Game 3, played in Buffalo, went down in hockey lore as \"The Fog Game\" due to an unusual May heatwave in Buffalo that forced parts of the game to be played in heavy fog, as Buffalo's arena lacked air conditioning. The Flyers lost Games 3 and 4, but won Game 5 at home in dominating fashion, 5–1. On the road for Game 6, Bob Kelly scored the decisive goal and Parent pitched another shutout (a playoff record fifth shutout) as the Flyers repeated as Stanley Cup champions. Parent also repeated as the playoff MVP, winning a second consecutive Conn Smythe Trophy.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 1989–90 season got off to a bad start for the Flyers, and continued to get worse. Hextall missed all but eight games due to suspension for attacking Chris Chelios at the end of the Montreal playoff series the previous spring, contract holdout issues, and injury. Holmgren replaced Dave Poulin as captain in December with Ron Sutter, which led to Poulin's (and later that season, Brian Propp's) trade to Boston. As a result, the Flyers missed the Stanley Cup playoffs for the first time since 1972. Bobby Clarke, having been with the Flyers organization since he was drafted in 1969, was fired and replaced as general manager by Russ Farwell.\n\n\nRon Hextall continued to be hampered by injuries during the 1990–91 season. He only played in 36 games and as a result the Flyers missed the playoffs for the second consecutive year, finishing fifth in the Division and three points short of a playoff spot after a late-season collapse.\n\n\n\n### Rebuilding years (1991–1994)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Eric Lindros trade\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn June 1992, the Flyers persuaded Bobby Clarke to return to the team as senior vice president after Jay Snider won the hard-fought arbitration battle for 1991 first overall pick Eric Lindros against the Rangers. It was determined that Quebec had made a deal with the Flyers before making a deal with the Rangers. In order to acquire Lindros' rights, the Flyers parted with six players, trading Steve Duchesne, Peter Forsberg, Ron Hextall, Kerry Huffman, Mike Ricci, Chris Simon, a 1993 first-round draft pick (Jocelyn Thibault), a 1994 first-round draft pick (Nolan Baumgartner) and $15 million to Quebec. While Lindros became a preeminent star in Philadelphia, the trade proved heavily lopsided in favor of the Nordiques – soon to become the Colorado Avalanche – providing the core of their two Stanley Cup teams and an unprecedented eight-straight division championships, with Forsberg becoming a franchise player.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n99. **^** \"Jason Smith Named Flyers Captain\".

The Flyers pulled off the upset in six games against a heavily favored Pittsburgh team. In the second round against New Jersey, the Flyers were heavily favored to win the series, but the Flyers' run-and-gun style of play was stymied by the Devils' forechecking and defense, and, although they won the first game at home in overtime, the Flyers lost four games in a row and were eliminated in five. Briere and Giroux ended the playoffs tied with five other players for the League lead in playoff goals with eight, despite their team being eliminated in the second round.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe elder Snider had decided he had seen enough of Farwell as general manager, and began courting Bobby Clarke to leave his general manager post with Florida to return to Philadelphia. Farwell's last move as general manager was firing Simpson after a lackluster performance. Clarke returned to the general manager position prior to the lockout-shortened 1994–95 season and immediately began putting his stamp on the team. New head coach Terry Murray replaced Kevin Dineen as team captain with Lindros prior to the start of training camp. In order to shore up the defense, Ron Hextall was re-acquired from the Islanders and high-scoring winger Recchi was traded to Montreal for Eric Desjardins, Gilbert Dionne and John LeClair early in the abbreviated season.\n\n\n\n![](image)Eric Lindros played for the Flyers from 1992–93 to 1999–2000.\n#### Legion of Doom (1994-1997)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe season began in the image of the *Broad Street Bullies* era, with multiple-game suspensions handed out to five separate players, the most serious being 25-game suspensions to both Steve Downie and Jesse Boulerice for two separate incidents. A 7–3 start in October and a 9–3–1 January run had the Flyers near the top of both the Division and Conference standings. However, a disastrous ten-game losing streak in February, reminiscent of such a streak the previous season, nearly derailed the Flyers' year. An 8–3–4 run in March, coupled with two huge wins over New Jersey and Pittsburgh over the final weekend of the regular season, put the Flyers back in the 2008 playoffs as the sixth seed, setting up a first-round matchup with Washington. After taking a three-game-to-one lead over the Capitals, Washington then won Games 5 and 6 to force a deciding Game 7 in Washington. After an evenly fought game, the Flyers ultimately won the series in overtime via a Joffrey Lupul powerplay goal. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 1999: Maxime Ouellet (22nd overall)\n* 2000: Justin Williams (28th overall)\n* 2001: Jeff Woywitka (27th overall)\n* 2002: Joni Pitkanen (4th overall)\n* 2003: Jeff Carter (11th overall) & Mike Richards (24th overall)\n* 2004: None\n* 2005: Steve Downie (29th overall)\n* 2006: Claude Giroux (22nd overall)\n* 2007: James van Riemsdyk (2nd overall)\n* 2008: Luca Sbisa (19th overall)\n* 2009: None\n* 2010: None\n* 2011: Sean Couturier (8th overall)\n* 2012: Scott Laughton (20th overall)\n* 2013: Samuel Morin (11th overall)\n* 2014: Travis Sanheim (17th overall)\n* 2015: Ivan Provorov (7th overall) & Travis Konecny (24th overall)\n* 2016: German Rubtsov (22nd overall)\n* 2017: Nolan Patrick (2nd overall) & Morgan Frost (27th overall)\n* 2018: Joel Farabee (14th overall) & Jay O'Brien (19th overall)\n* 2019: Cam York (14th overall)\n* 2020: Tyson Foerster (23rd overall)\n* 2021: None\n* 2022: Cutter Gauthier (5th overall)\n* 2023: Matvei Michkov (7th overall) & Oliver Bonk (22nd overall)\n\n### Honored members[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDespite finishing at the .500 mark in 1988–89, the Flyers made the playoffs for the 17th consecutive season. Facing first-place Washington in the first round, the Flyers pulled off the upset in six games. Ron Hextall managed to score another empty-net goal in the waning moments of Game 5, becoming the first NHL goalie to score a goal in the playoffs. The Flyers then defeated Pittsburgh in seven games to make the Wales Conference Finals before bowing out to Montreal in six games.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the Eastern Conference Finals, the Flyers had home-ice advantage as they faced eighth-seeded Montreal. Leighton became the first Flyers netminder to record three shutouts in a series, and Carter and Laperriere returned to the lineup as the Flyers won the Eastern Conference Championship in five games, advancing to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time since 1997 to face the Chicago Blackhawks. Dropping two close games in Chicago, the Flyers returned home to win Game 3 in overtime and Game 4 to even the series. A convincing 7–4 win by Chicago in Game 5, however, put the Flyers one game away from elimination. A late Scott Hartnell goal in Game 6 forced overtime, but Patrick Kane scored just over four minutes into overtime to eliminate the Flyers and give Chicago their first Stanley Cup since 1961. Ville Leino, acquired in a mid-season trade from Detroit, set the Flyers rookie playoff scoring record and tied the NHL record with 21 points. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* National Constitution Center\n* National Liberty Museum\n* National Museum of American Jewish History\n* Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts\n* Philadelphia History Museum\n* Philadelphia Museum of Art\n* Philadelphia's Magic Gardens\n* Please Touch Museum\n* Powel House\n* RittenhouseTown\n* Rodin Museum\n* Rosenbach Museum and Library\n* Ryerss Museum and Library\n* Science History Institute\n* Shofuso Japanese House and Garden\n* Stenton\n* Thaddeus Kosciuszko National Memorial\n* Penn Museum\n* Wagner Free Institute of Science\n* Woodmere Art Museum\n* Wyck House\n |\n| Sports | * 76ers\n* Eagles\n* Flyers\n* Freedoms\n* Phillies\n* Union\n |\n| Squares | * Centre\n* Franklin\n* Logan\n* Rittenhouse\n* Washington\n |\n| Related | * Delaware Valley\n* Carpenters' Hall\n* Independence Hall\n* Congress Hall\n* Liberty Bell\n* Syng inkstand\n* SS *United States*\n* 2016 Democratic National Convention\n |\n| * ![](image) Category\n* ![](image) Portal\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 1967: Serge Bernier (5th overall)\n* 1968: Lew Morrison (8th overall)\n* 1969: Bob Currier (6th overall)\n* 1970: None\n* 1971: Larry Wright (8th overall) & Pierre Plante (9th overall)\n* 1972: Bill Barber (7th overall)\n* 1973: None\n* 1974: None\n* 1975: Mel Bridgman (1st overall)\n* 1976: Mark Suzor (17th overall)\n* 1977: Kevin McCarthy (17th overall)\n* 1978: Behn Wilson (6th overall) & Ken Linseman (7th overall) & Danny Lucas (14th overall)\n* 1979: Brian Propp (14th overall)\n* 1980: Mike Stothers (21st overall)\n* 1981: Steve Smith (16th overall)\n* 1982: Ron Sutter (4th overall)\n* 1983: None\n* 1984: None\n* 1985: Glen Seabrooke (21st overall)\n* 1986: Kerry Huffman (20th overall)\n* 1987: Darren Rumble (20th overall)\n* 1988: Claude Boivin (14th overall)\n* 1989: None\n* 1990: Mike Ricci (4th overall)\n* 1991: Peter Forsberg (6th overall)\n* 1992: Ryan Sittler (7th overall)\n* 1993: None\n* 1994: None\n* 1995: Brian Boucher (22nd overall)\n* 1996: Dainius Zubrus (15th overall)\n* 1997: None\n* 1998: Simon Gagne (22nd overall)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWith Lindros out indefinitely, the Flyers rallied to overcome the distractions and a 15-point deficit in the standings to win the Atlantic Division and the top seed in the East on the last day of the regular season. They easily defeated their first-round opponent, Buffalo, in five games. Primeau's goal in the fifth overtime of Game 4 against the team's second-round opponent, Pittsburgh, turned that series in the Flyers' favor as they won in six games, coming back from a 2–0 series deficit. After dropping Game 1 to New Jersey in the Eastern Conference Finals, the Flyers won three-straight games to take a 3–1 series lead. However, New Jersey won game 5. In Game 6, Lindros returned to the lineup for the first time since March in another losing effort.

Clarke's efforts earned him his second Hart Trophy and Parent was the lone recipient of the Vezina Trophy. The Flyers as a team improved their record slightly with a mark of 51–18–11, the best record in the NHL. After a first-round bye, the Flyers easily swept the Toronto Maple Leafs and were presented with another New York-area team in the semi-finals, the New York Islanders. The Flyers looked to be headed toward another sweep after winning the first three games. However, the Islanders fought back by winning the next three games, setting up a deciding seventh game. The Flyers were finally able to shut the door on the Islanders, winning Game 7, 4–1.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMany NHL teams started using third jerseys during the mid-1990s and the Flyers unveiled a black third jersey that was similar in design to their second-generation jerseys during the 1997–98 season. During the 2000 Stanley Cup playoffs, the black jersey became the primary dark jersey with the orange jersey being retired after the 2000–01 season (although it was worn for one final game early in the following season on Halloween night). In 2002–03, a new orange third jersey was introduced which was a radical departure from any jersey the Flyers had used before. Unique striping and fonts were used along with the aforementioned metallic 3D logo and the first use of a color other than orange, black or white on a Flyers jersey – silver/gray. These jerseys were used until the end of the 2006–07 season.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHowever, lackluster play throughout March and April, coupled with a broken hand suffered by Chris Pronger in late February that ended his regular season, cost the Flyers the top seed in the East during the last week of the regular season, although the Flyers hung on to win their first Atlantic Division title since 2003–04 and clinched the second seed in the East.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Bill Barber\n* Bobby Clarke\n* Paul Coffey\n* Peter Forsberg\n* Dale Hawerchuk\n* Mark Howe\n* Eric Lindros\n* Adam Oates\n* Bernie Parent\n* Chris Pronger\n* Mark Recchi\n* Darryl Sittler\n* Allan Stanley\n\n**Builders**\n\n\n\n* Keith Allen\n* Ken Hitchcock\n* Roger Neilson\n* Bud Poile\n* Pat Quinn\n* Fred Shero\n* Ed Snider\n\n#### Retired numbers[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of NHL retired numbers\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Flyers initially struggled out of the gate, going only 3–7–1 through their first 11 games while being outscored 34–22. Lindros and LeClair then teamed with Renberg to form the Legion of Doom line, a mix of scoring talent and physical intimidation. In their 37 games (including the 3–1 victory on February 11, 1995, against the New Jersey Devils), the Flyers went 25–9–3 and outscored their opponents 128–98 en route. Lindros tied Jaromir Jagr for the regular season scoring lead (though Jagr won the Art Ross Trophy with more goals), and captured the Hart Memorial Trophy as the league's MVP. The playoff drought came to an end as the Flyers won their first division title in eight years and clinched the second seed in the Eastern Conference. After dispatching Buffalo in five and sweeping the defending Stanley Cup champion Rangers, the Flyers were upset in the Eastern Conference Finals to the eventual Stanley Cup champion New Jersey Devils in six games.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Flyers would go on to win over the Penguins again in the 2000 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals, most remembered for Keith Primeau scoring the game winning goal in the fifth overtime period of game four, becoming the third longest playoff game in league history with a total game time of 152 minutes. The Penguins first playoff victory against the Flyers came during the 2008 Eastern Conference Finals, winning the series in five games to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals. The two teams would meet again in the playoffs the following year in the 2009 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals, with the Penguins defeating the Flyers in six games. The rivalry would come to a boiling point during the 2012 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals when both teams combined for an NHL record 45 goals in the first four games of a playoff series, as well as accumulating 309 penalty minutes. Game three saw a total combined 158 penalty minutes between the two teams, as well as multiple suspensions. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n136. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Apody, Jamie (December 6, 2021). \"Flyers fire head coach Alain Vigneault following 8 straight losses\". *6abc Philadelphia*.

With Hextall providing the critical stops at crucial times, the Flyers captured a third-straight Patrick Division title, and were able to gain revenge on the Rangers by beating them in six games in the division semifinals, as well as surviving a tough seven-game test from a gritty Islanders club, in the division finals. The Flyers then defeated the defending Stanley Cup champion Canadiens in a fiery six-game series (notable for a famous bench-clearing brawl during the Game 6 warmup) to win the Wales Conference and return to the Stanley Cup Finals. As was the case two seasons prior, the Flyers became decimated by injuries, the most significant of which was losing Kerr for the remainder of the playoffs. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)In 1996, the Flyers moved to their present home arena, the CoreStates Center (now the Wells Fargo Center).\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n114. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"SPORTS PEOPLE; 2 Coaches Out\". *The New York Times*.

Despite being hampered by injuries prior to and during the season, the Flyers lived up to those expectations in the first half of the season, reaching the top of the league standings in January while simultaneously holding a 10-point lead in the Atlantic Division. The *Deuces Wild* line of Forsberg, Gagne, and Mike Knuble recorded 75, 79 and 65 points respectively while Gagne, with Forsberg feeding him, scored a career-high of 47 goals. However, the injuries began to accumulate and take their toll, the most crippling of which was Keith Primeau's season-ending concussion. Derian Hatcher served as interim captain for the remainder of the season. The Flyers had been first in the league prior to the Olympic break, where an injury to Forsberg occurred. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n78. **^** \"Penguins Pick Up Angotti in 3-Team Trade\". *Chicago Tribune*.

Barry Ashbee's number 4 was retired a few months after his death from leukemia.[151] Bernie Parent's number 1[a] and Bobby Clarke's number 16 were retired less than a year the players' retirement, while Bill Barber's number 7 and Mark Howe's number 2 were retired shortly after their inductions into the Hockey Hall of Fame. The number 31, last worn by goaltender Pelle Lindbergh, was removed from circulation after Lindbergh's death on November 11, 1985, but it is not officially retired.[153] The NHL retired Wayne Gretzky's No. 99 for all its member teams at the 2000 NHL All-Star Game.[154] In 2018, the Flyers retired Eric Lindros' number 88.[155]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Most goals in a season: Reggie Leach, 61 (1975–76)\n* Most assists in a season: Bobby Clarke, 89 (1974–75 & 1975–76)\n* Most points in a season: Mark Recchi, 123 (1992–93)\n* Most penalty minutes in a season: Dave Schultz, 472 (1974–75) (NHL record)\n* Most points in a season, defenseman: Mark Howe, 82 (1985–86)\n* Most points in a season, rookie: Mikael Renberg, 82 (1993–94)\n* Most wins in a season: Bernie Parent, 47 (1973–74)\n* Most shutouts in a season: Bernie Parent, 12 (1973–74 & 1974–75)\n* Most power play goals in a season: Tim Kerr, 34 (1985–86) (NHL record)\n\n\n#### Playoffs[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFollowing the season, the Flyers were stunned when head coach Shero left to become general manager and head coach of the New York Rangers. As compensation for Shero, the Flyers received the Rangers' first-round draft pick in 1978.\n\n\n\n![](image)Bill Barber played for the Flyers from 1972–73 to 1983–84\nBob McCammon, who had just coached the Flyers' first year American Hockey League (AHL) Maine Mariners farm club to a Calder Cup title, replaced Fred Shero behind the bench. After a slow start in 1978–79, the Flyers switched McCammon with Pat Quinn, Shero's previous assistant coach, who had replaced McCammon with the Mariners. Adding to the problems, Bernie Parent suffered a career-ending eye injury. The Flyers rallied under Quinn and finished in second place. Matched up against the Vancouver Canucks in the preliminary round, the Flyers won the series in three games. The Flyers' season came to an end against Fred Shero's Rangers in a five-game quarterfinal loss.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFlyers general manager Paul Holmgren made two franchise-altering trades within the span of an hour on June 23, 2011, trading Mike Richards to the Los Angeles Kings for Brayden Schenn, Wayne Simmonds and a 2012 second-round draft pick, and Jeff Carter to Columbus for their 2011 first-round pick (with which the Flyers selected Sean Couturier), 2011 third-round pick (with which the Flyers selected Nick Cousins) and Jakub Voracek. Later that same day, Holmgren addressed the Flyers' long-standing goaltending issues by signing the Phoenix Coyotes' Ilya Bryzgalov to a nine-year, $51 million contract. On July 1, the Flyers signed Jaromir Jagr to a one-year contract, Maxime Talbot to a five-year contract and Andreas Lilja to a two-year contract. Additionally, Chris Pronger was named Flyers captain; however, 13 games into the 2011–12 season, he was lost for the remainder of the regular season and playoffs with severe post-concussion syndrome. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Wayne Simmonds played for the Flyers from 2011–12 to 2018–19Despite finishing sixth in their division, they won the second overall pick in the 2017 NHL Entry Draft lottery with just a 2.4% chance to win that particular pick. They used this pick to select Nolan Patrick from the Brandon Wheat Kings. In the 2017–18 season, the Flyers rallied from a 10-game losing streak early in the season to finish in third place in the Metropolitan Division but lost to Pittsburgh in six games in the first round of the 2018 playoffs. They clinched a playoff spot on the last game of the season, at home against the Rangers, winning 5–0 with the help of a Claude Giroux hat trick. In that game, Giroux became the first Flyer to have a 100-point season since Eric Lindros in 1995–96, finishing second in league scoring and fourth in MVP voting, while Couturier was a finalist for the Selke Trophy, and Simmonds was a finalist for the Mark Messier Leadership Award.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAll told, the Flyers were third in the NHL with 388 man-games lost to injury, tops amongst playoff teams.[34] The second half of the regular season was defined by a record hovering around .500, sending the Flyers on a steady slide in the standings. The Flyers fell short of an Atlantic Division title, finishing second by tie-breaker to New Jersey, drawing the fifth seed in the Eastern Conference and a first-round match-up with fourth-seeded Buffalo. The Flyers lost the series in six games.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe trio of Lindros, Recchi and Brent Fedyk formed the Crazy Eights line in Lindros' first two years in the NHL, the eights being the player's jersey numbers (88, 8 and 18 respectively). In 1992–93, Recchi set the franchise record for points in a season with 123 (53 goals and 70 assists) and Lindros scored 41 goals in 61 games. After struggling early, the Flyers made a run at the playoffs, but came four points short of the last spot. Head coach Bill Dineen was fired at the season's end, while Clarke left town again to become general manager of the expansion Florida Panthers.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The Spectrum was the home arena for the Philadelphia Flyers from 1967 to 1996.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Flyers began the 2021–22 season off to a steady pace by winning six out of the first ten games of the season, however once again things would start to fall apart for the team. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### New York Islanders[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Flyers–Islanders rivalry\n\n### New York Rangers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Flyers–Rangers rivalry\n\n### Pittsburgh Penguins[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Flyers–Penguins rivalry\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Flyers unveiled a new uniform design ahead of the 2023–24 season, reverting to the burnt orange shade they wore with the 1984–2007 uniforms. This design featured wider shoulder and sleeve stripes, single-colored sleeve numbers (black on the home uniform, white on the road uniform), and a black bottom stripe, all of which were visual nods to previous Flyers uniforms. The contrasting nameplate was also retained. The black alternate first used in the 2017 Stadium Series was also kept in circulation.[1]\n\n\n\n### Cooperall pants[edit]\n\n\nThe Flyers were the first and one of only two NHL teams (the Hartford Whalers being the other) to wear Cooperalls, hockey pants that extend from the waist to the ankles, in 1981–82. They wore them the following season as well, but returned to the traditional hockey pants in 1983–84 due to Cooperalls being banned from the NHL for safety reasons.\n\n\n\n### Mascots[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Gritty\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDespite holding on to the fourth seed in the East for much of the season, thanks to a 4–5–1 finish to the season, highlighted by a home loss to the Rangers on the last day of the regular season, the Flyers slipped to the fifth seed and lost home-ice advantage in their first-round series with Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh dominated the Flyers in Game 1, and despite a better effort by the Flyers in Game 2, Pittsburgh came to Philadelphia with a 2–0 series lead. The Flyers were the better team in Games 3 and 4, but Pittsburgh gained a split in Philadelphia and took a 3–1 series lead. After a decisive 3–0 win in Game 5, the Flyers jumped out to a 3–0 lead in Game 6, but promptly fell victim to the inconsistencies that plagued the team all season and gave up five unanswered goals in a season-ending 5–3 loss. Giroux led the team in scoring in the playoffs. Jeff Carter ended the regular season with 46 goals, second in the NHL after Washington's Alexander Ovechkin.

Hextall became the first NHL goaltender to score a goal by firing the puck into an empty net in a December 8 game against Boston. In their first-round playoff series with Washington, the Flyers blew a 3–1 series lead as Washington forced a Game 7. They then blew a 3–0 lead in Game 7 as Washington won in overtime 5–4. It was because of this playoff collapse that \"Iron Mike\" was fired. Paul Holmgren was named Keenan's replacement, the first time a former Flyer was named the club's head coach.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe changes did little to improve the Flyers fortunes in 2006–07 as setting franchise records for futility became the norm. They had several multiple-game losing streaks, including a franchise-worst 10-game losing streak and a 13-game home losing streak that stretched from November 29 to February 10. Ultimately, the Flyers finished with a 22–48–12 record, the most losses and the worst winning percentage in franchise history, and the worst record in the league. They also set the NHL record for the biggest points drop off in the standings in a one-year span (101 points in 2005–06 to 56 points in 2006–07, a difference of 45 points). The Flyers lost the NHL draft lottery to the Chicago Blackhawks and received the second overall selection.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPrior to the 1991–92 season, the Flyers acquired Rod Brind'Amour from St. Louis. Brind'Amour led the Flyers in goals (33), assists (44) and points (77) in his first season with the club. With Ron Sutter gone to St. Louis in the Brind'Amour trade, Rick Tocchet was named team captain. As the Flyers continued to flounder, Paul Holmgren was fired midway through the season and replaced by Bill Dineen, father of Flyer Kevin Dineen. On February 19, the Flyers and Pittsburgh made a major five-player deal which featured Tocchet – who never grew comfortably into the role of captain – heading to Pittsburgh and Mark Recchi coming to Philadelphia. Recchi recorded 27 points in his first 22 games as a Flyer, but the team missed the playoffs for the third consecutive year, due in large part to an awful road record (10–26–4). With Tocchet traded, the Flyers remained without a captain until Kevin Dineen was named to the post in 1993–94, and instead went with three alternate captains.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Mark Howe played for the Flyers from 1982–83 to 1991–92\nOver the next three seasons the team would suffer early playoff exits and manage to win only one playoff game during that span. They were eliminated two years in a row in 1981–82 and 1982–83 by the New York Rangers and then were swept by the Washington Capitals in 1983–84. Following the loss to Washington, Bobby Clarke retired from play and was named vice-president and general manager of the team. Mike Keenan, a relative unknown at the time, was hired in 1984 to coach the team, and named second-year player Dave Poulin team captain.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn December 11, 1969, the Flyers introduced what became one of the team's best-known traditions: playing a recording of Kate Smith singing \"God Bless America\" instead of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" before important games. The perception was that the team was more successful on these occasions, so the tradition grew. The move was initially done by Flyers Promotion Director Lou Scheinfeld as a way to defray national tensions at the time of the Vietnam War: Scheinfeld noticed that people regularly left their seats and walked around during the anthem, but showed more respect and often sang along to \"God Bless America\". As of the close of the 2016–17 season, the Flyers have a record of 100–29–5 when \"God Bless America\" was sung prior to Flyers home games.[22]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_Y0buWn3f17ZjQoFJSNlH1fpz","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
