With capital provided by the Ministry of Finance of China,[12] the bank's Tier 1 capital in 2013 was the largest of one thousand global banks, being the first bank headquartered in China to achieve this distinction in modern history.[13][9] Subsequently, ranked the largest bank in the world 2017 and 2018, by total assets,[14] (31 December 2020, US$4.324 trillion[8]), ICBC was positioned at 1st in The Banker's Top 1000 World Banks ranking, every year from 2012,[15] and first (2019) on the Forbes Global 2000 list of the world's biggest public companies.[16] ICBC is also the 3rd largest bank in the world by market capitalization at $211 billion (31-Dec-2022).[17]\n\n\nFurthermore, ICBC is considered one of the most profitable companies in the world, ranking fourth according to Forbes.[18] It is considered a systemically important bank by the Financial Stability Board.\n\n\nSeveral former employees of ICBC have moved on to work in prominent government positions in China. Notable ICBC alumni include Chairman of CSRC Huiman Yi, and Deputy Governor of PBoC Gongsheng Pan.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)ICBC building in Tokyo\n![](image)ICBC building in Luxembourg\n![](image)ICBC building in Karachi\n![](image)ICBC Beijing Qunfang Sub-branch at Universal Beijing Resort\n### Preconditions of 1948\u20131979[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1948 the mono-banking system of China was the People's Bank of China, providing both policy lending, and, operations to the commercial sector. During 1978 to[19] 1979 banking reform was initiated by the government of China, with the express desire of bringing into existence a central bank accompanying four total central governmentally owned specializing banks, one of these four being ICBC.[20]\n\n\n\n### 1979\u20131985[edit]\n\n\nA Two-Tier banking system was made.[19]\n\n\n\n### 1984\u20132005[edit]\n\n\nBy rights of a contradiction within the economic functioning of the government of China, the People's Republic, the State Council of China,[21] during September of[22] 1983 made a decision to separate certain activities of the government to an exclusively operating organisation, subsequently named the Industrial and Commercial bank of China,[21] established on 1 January 1984.[11][*non-primary source needed*] ICBC was then the fourth of the four specialist banks of 1978\u20131979 to be made,[22] from the taking of control of commercial activities[22] (\"industrial credit and savings business\"[23]) from People's Bank of China so that the latter might be transformed to a newly made central bank.[22][23] ICBC focused on the intermediation of deposits.[24]:\u200a225\n\n\nICBC opened a branch in Luxembourg which became the European headquarters of the bank in 2011.[25] ICBC (Europe) S.A. operates a network covering branches in major European cities, namely Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels, Milan, Madrid, Barcelona, Warsaw and Lisbon.[26]\n\n\nThe bank's Hong Kong operations are listed under the name ICBC Asia. It has purchased the Hong Kong subsidiary of Fortis Bank and rebranded it under its own name on 10 October 2005.\n\n\nIn June 2005, ICBC Credit Suisse Asset Management Co., Ltd., a joint venture between ICBC (55%), Credit Suisse First Boston (25%) and COSCO (20%), was formally established in China. Subsequently, ICBC acquired the 20% stake from COSCO and a 5% stake from CSFB.\n\n\n\n### 2006\u20132008[edit]\n\n\n#### Customer base[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2006, ICBC had 2.5\u00a0million corporate customers and 150 million individual customers.[27]\n\n\n\n#### IPO[edit]\n\n\nIn the runup to its planned initial public offering, on 28 April 2006, three \"strategic investors\" injected US$3.7\u00a0billion into ICBC:\n\n\n\n* Goldman Sachs purchased a 5.75% stake for US$2.6\u00a0billion, the largest sum Goldman Sachs has ever invested.[28]\n* Dresdner Bank (a wholly owned subsidiary of Commerzbank) invested US$1\u00a0billion.[29]\n* American Express invested US$200\u00a0million.[29]\n\n\nICBC was simultaneously listed on both the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and Shanghai Stock Exchange on 27 October 2006. It was the world's largest IPO at that time valued at US$21.9\u00a0billion, surpassing the previous record US$18.4\u00a0billion IPO by Japan's NTT DoCoMo in 1998.[30] In 2010, Agricultural Bank of China broke ICBC's IPO record when it raised $22.1\u00a0billion. China's largest commercial bank was also the first company to debut simultaneously on both the Hong Kong and Shanghai stock exchanges.\n\n\nICBC raised at least US$14\u00a0billion in Hong Kong (H-shares) and another US$5.1\u00a0billion in Shanghai (A-shares). Due to heavy subscriptions, the greenshoe (i.e. over-allotment) placements were exercised and ICBC's take rose to US$21.9\u00a0billion (17% of ICBC's market value before the IPO), divided in US$16\u00a0billion in Hong Kong and US$5.9\u00a0billion in Shanghai. Following the global offering, the free float of shares was 22.14% of the market capitalization.\n\n\nAt the end of its first day of trading, the bank's shares closed up almost 15% at HK$3.52 in Hong Kong, compared with the listing price of HK$3.07, which was set at the top of the indicative range due to the strong demand. According to Bloomberg, ICBC's market capitalisation at the end of trade based on its Hong Kong shares was US$156.3\u00a0billion, making its equity the world's fifth highest among banks, just behind JPMorgan Chase. Meanwhile, ICBC's Shanghai-listed A-shares recorded more modest gains and ended up 5.1% from the offering price of RMB 3.12.\n\n\nDuring July 2007 ICBC was ranked 30th in the world in terms of revenue.[31]\n\n\n\n#### Foreign activity[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2008, ICBC became the second Chinese bank since 1991 to gain federal approval to establish a branch in New York City.[32] ICBC had signed a lease with the Trump Organization for office space in the Trump Tower in 2008. ICBC was Trump Tower's largest office tenant as of 2012.[33] By October 2020, Donald Trump received $5.4 million from ICBC via the Trump Tower lease.[34]\n\n\nICBC loans $400\u00a0million towards the completion of the Gibe III dam in Ethiopia. Groups that oppose the dam such as International Rivers and Survival International have complained about or have written to ICBC against the dam's funding.[35][36]\n\n\n\n### 2011\u2013present[edit]\n\n\nOn 24 January 2011, ICBC opened a branch office in Madrid, Spain.[37]\n\n\nOn 20 May 2011, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd. established two branches in Pakistan, one in Karachi, the other in Islamabad. On 18 August 2011, ICBC passed the examination from State Bank of Pakistan and started its business in Pakistan.\n\n\nDuring November 2012, ICBC acquires a 80% stake (valued at $600\u00a0million) of Standard Bank Argentina, the largest operation of a Chinese bank in Latin America. In Argentina, the bank has ~1,000,000 individual customers, ~30,000 companies of all categories and more than 1600 corporate companies.\n\n\nDuring the 2013 Korean crisis, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China halted business with a North Korean bank accused by the United States of financing Pyongyang's missile and nuclear programs.[38]\n\n\nIt was announced at the end of July 2013 that South Africa's Standard Bank was in talks to sell its markets business in London to the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China for more than $500\u00a0million.[39]\n\n\nOn 24 September 2014, ICBC Kuwait Branch officially opened in Kuwait City, capital of Kuwait. As the first and currently the only Chinese bank in Kuwait, the establishment of ICBC Kuwait Branch ended the history of no Chinese bank's presence in Kuwait. Meanwhile, it is also the fourth branch of ICBC in the Middle East, following branches in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Doha.\n\n\nAs of 2 December 2014, ICBC is ranked the largest bank in the world by assets and by tier 1 capital.[40]\n\n\nOn 25 May 2015, the Company further strengthened its presence in the Middle East and Europe by purchasing[41] Turkey's TekstilBank and forming its ICBC Turkey subsidiary.\n\n\nOn 17 February 2016, the Spanish Guardia Civil raided the offices of ICBC in Madrid, Spain, investigating suspicions of money laundering.[37]\n\n\nOn 18 November 2016, the bank obtained a license to take deposits in Russia.\n\n\nICBC Financial Services, the bank's brokerage unit, provided about $88\u00a0billion of repo financing at the end of 2015, up from $59\u00a0billion two years ago, according to regulatory filings. The figures are before netting agreements that can be used to reduce overall assets and liabilities. Almost all the repo financing that ICBC provides is on U.S. government bonds.[42]\n\n\nICBC launched robo-advisor service to its wealth-management operations in 2017.[43][44]\n\n\nIn October 2017, the Bank reported a 3.3 percent rise in its net profit for the third quarter.[45]\n\n\nICBC reported 10.3 pct growth in its profit along with exceptional growth in its revenue during the year 2021. This was caused by the gradual recovery of the Chinese economy after the COVID-19 pandemic.[46]\n\n\nIn November 2023, the bank was subject to a ransomware attack, preventing certain trades from clearing.[47]\n\n\n\n## Finances[edit]\n\n\n### Accounting[edit]\n\n\nICBC has the policy[48] of preparing accounts conforming to the[8] International Financial Reporting Standards,[49][8] accepting specifically criteria IFRS 9 (pertains to the definition and rating of asset, liability, and a number of all of the existing purchasing contracts for non-financial purchases[50]) from 1 January 2018. and IFRS 16 (pertaining to lease[51]) from 1 January 2019.[48]\n\n\n\n### Basic figures[edit]\n\n\n#### 2005[edit]\n\n\nIn 2005, net profit was up 12.4% to RMB 33.7\u00a0billion, and the total loan balance was RMB 3,289.5\u00a0billion. Total liabilities are RMB 6,196.2\u00a0billion, up 11.2%. Delinquent or non-performing loans (NPL) total RMB 154.4\u00a0billion, a significant reduction although the figures are widely regarded as being somewhat higher than officially stated. It has an NPL ratio of 4.69% and a capital adequacy ratio of 9.89%.\n\n\n\n#### Summary[edit]\n\n\n##### 2003\u20132018[edit]\n\n\nFinancials in Renminbi[5][52][53][54][55][56][57]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year | 2003 | 2004 | 2005 | 2006 | 2007 | 2008 | 2009 | 2010\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Revenue, bln | 107.5 | 126.7 | 193.1 | 181.6 | 257.4 | 310.2 | 309.4 | 380.7\n |\n| Net Income, bln | 2.473 | 2.311 | 33.70 | 49.26 | 81.52 | 110.8 | 129.4 | 166.0\n |\n| Assets, trln | 5.279 | 5.671 | 6.454 | 7.509 | 8.684 | 9.757 | 11.79 | 13.46\n |\n| Equity, bln | 170.5 | 163.0 | 253.4 | 466.5 | 538.4 | 602.7 | 673.9 | 820.4\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Year | 2011 | 2012 | 2013 | 2014 | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Revenue, bln | 470.6 | 529.7 | 578.9 | 634.9 | 668.7 | 641.7 | 675.7 | 725.1\n |\n| Net Income, bln | 208.4 | 238.7 | 263.0 | 276.3 | 277.7 | 279.1 | 287.5 | 298.7\n |\n| Assets, trln | 15.48 | 17.54 | 18.92 | 20.61 | 22.21 | 24.14 | 26.09 | 27.70\n |\n| Equity, bln | 956.7 | 1125 | 1274 | 1531 | 1789 | 1970 | 2127 | 2330\n |\n\n\n### Loans[edit]\n\n\n#### Listed to industry[edit]\n\n\nIn millions of Chinese RMB (Yuan) in 2005:\n\n\n\n* Manufacturing: 662,376, 20.1% (28.7% in 2004)\n* Transportation, storage, postage & telecommunications: 367,371, 11.2% (10.2% in 2004)\n* Power, gas and water: 281,179, 8.6% (7.0% in 2004)\n* Retail and wholesale, catering: 265,906, 8.1% (6.9% in 2004)\n* Property development: 194,024, 5.9%, (5.6% in 2004)\n* Social service organization: 103,070, 3.1%, (3.2% in 2004)\n* Construction: 89,666, 2.7%, (2.1% in 2004)\n* Other industries: 313,804, 9.5%, (12.1% in 2004)\n* Discounted bills: 392,717, 11.9%, (8.4% in 2004)\n* Personal loans: 515,042, 15.7%, (13.1% in 2004)\n* Overseas business: 104,398, 3.2%, (2.7% in 2004)\n\n\nTotal: 3,289,553\n\n\n\n#### With collateralization[edit]\n\n\n* Secured by mortgages: 34.1%\n* Secured by other collateral: 22.1%\n* Guaranteed loans: 23.3%\n* Unsecured loans: 20.5%\n\n\n#### Non-performing[edit]\n\n\nAt the end of 2004, 19.1% of ICBC's portfolio consisted of non-performing loans.[58] To clean up ICBC's balance sheet and prepare it for overseas listing, the Chinese government orchestrated a series of capital injections, asset transfers, and government-subsidised bad loan disposals that eventually cost more than US$162\u00a0billion.[59] This included an approval for a cash injection of US$15\u00a0billion (financed from China's massive foreign exchange reserves) on 28 April 2005.[60] The Beijing-based state company, China Huarong Asset Management, helped ICBC dispose of its bad loans. As the 2005 annual report records, just under 5% of loans are classified as non-performing, in comparison with the majority of western banks who have lower NPL ratios (US commercial banks are typically around 1%).[61]\n\n\n\n## Board of directors[edit]\n\n\nThe company has 449,226 employees. There are 24 members of the board, with one chairman, one supervisory board chairman and one vice-chairman. Chen Siqing, the current chairman, assumed his role[62] after resigning in April 2019 from Bank of China, where he was the chair, executive director and chairman and participating board member within the Strategic Development Committee.

In 2015, CCB was the 2nd largest bank in the world by market capitalization and 6th largest company in the world.[3][4] The bank has approximately 13,629 domestic branches. In addition, it maintains overseas branches in London, Barcelona, Frankfurt, Luxembourg, Hong Kong, Johannesburg, New York City, Seoul, Singapore, Tokyo, Melbourne, Kuala Lumpur, Santiago de Chile, Brisbane, Sydney and Auckland. Its total assets reached CN\u00a5 8.7\u00a0trillion in 2009,[5] and it is considered a systemically important bank by the Financial Stability Board. Its headquarters is in Xicheng District, Beijing.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Branch in Xinhui, Guangdong\nCCB was founded on 1 October 1954 under the name of People's Construction Bank of China (Chinese: \u4e2d\u56fd\u4eba\u6c11\u5efa\u8bbe\u94f6\u884c; pinyin: *Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 R\u00e9nm\u00edn Ji\u00e0nsh\u00e8 Y\u00ednh\u00e1ng*), and later changed to China Construction Bank on 26 March 1996. It was established in order to focus on financing for investments, in the context of the People's Bank of China beginning to spin off its commercial banking functions.[7]:\u200a225\n\n\nIn January 2002, CCB Chairman Wang Xuebing resigned from the bank after being charged with accepting bribes while he was employed with Bank of China; he was sentenced to 12 years in prison. In March 2005, his successor, Zhang Enzhao, resigned for \"personal reasons\". Just prior to his resignation, he had been charged in a lawsuit with accepting a US$1\u00a0million bribe. He was later sentenced to 15 years in jail in connection with the case.[8][9]\n\n\nChina Construction Bank Corporation was formed as a joint-stock commercial bank in September 2004 as a result of a separation procedure undertaken by its predecessor, China Construction Bank, under the PRC Company Law. Following the China Banking Regulatory Committee's approval on 14 September 2004, the next day the bank (Jianyin) became a separate legal entity, owned by the Chinese government holding company, Central Huijin Investment Company or simply Huijin.\n\n\nDuring the 2013 Korean crisis, the China Construction Bank halted business with a North Korean bank accused by the United States of financing Pyongyang's missile and nuclear programs.[10]\n\n\nIn 2015, China Construction Bank ranks the 2nd in *Forbes*\u2019 13th annual Global 2000 ranking of the biggest, most powerful and most valuable companies in the world.[11]\n\n\nIn 2021, China Construction Bank ranks the 3rd largest bank around the world in Forbes' 2021 Global 2000 list.[12] It ranks 5th in Forbes' 2022 Global 2000 list.\n\n\n\n## Investment by Bank of America[edit]\n\n\nIn 2005, Bank of America acquired a 9% stake in China Construction Bank for US$3\u00a0billion. It represented the company's largest foray into China's growing banking sector. Bank of America currently has offices in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Guangzhou and sought to expand its Chinese business as a result of this deal.\n\n\nOn or about 5 June 2008, Bank of America purchased 6 billion H-shares for approximately HK$2.42 per share using call options under a formula in the initial acquisition agreement. Bank of America now holds about 25.1 billion H-shares, representing about 10.75% of CCB's issued shares. Bank of America may not sell the 6 billion shares that it purchased from Huijin using the call option before 29 August 2011 without prior consent of CCB. Bank of America still has the option to purchase additional shares.[13]\n\n\nIn May 2009, speculation was raised that US$7.3\u00a0billion worth of CCB shares had been sold by BoA after being ordered to obtain more capital following the results of the Dodd-Frank Act Annual Stress Test.[14]\n\n\nOn 29 August 2011, Bank of America announced it would sell approximately half its stake in CCB (13.1 billion shares worth about US$8.3\u00a0billion) to an undisclosed group of investors.[15]\n\n\nIn September 2013, Bank of America sold its remaining stake in the China Construction Bank for as much as $1.5 billion.[16]\n\n\nIn June 2017, China Construction Bank (Malaysia) signs 13 Memorandum of Understandings on its opening day in Malaysia.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## International expansion[edit]\n\n\nIn 2006, CCB acquired Bank of America (Asia), which started in 1912 in Hong Kong as Bank of Canton, and had a subsidiary in Macao.\n\n\nCCB opened a London office on 2 June 2009.\n\n\nIn 2008, CCB submitted an application to the New York State Banking Department and the Federal Reserve Board to establish a branch in New York City.[17][18] CCB officially opened its New York branch on 6 June 2009.\n\n\nIn 2013, CCB opened its European Headquarters in Luxembourg.[19]\n\n\nIn 2016, CCB Indonesia was founded by the merger between two banks: Bank Windu Kentjana and Bank Anda.\n\n\n\n## Health fund[edit]\n\n\nChina Construction Bank investment division launched a CN\u00a55\u00a0billion (US$731.3\u00a0million) fund called **China Healthcare Investment Fund** to focus on investments in China's rapidly growing healthcare sector. The fund focuses on investments in healthcare related sectors including pharmacy, medical equipment manufacturing, medical institutions and services. It is the first domestic investment fund specializing in investments in China's healthcare industry.[20]\n\n\n\n## Stock exchanges listing[edit]\n\n\nIn late 2005, China Construction Bank made an initial public offering on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong. In late 2007, it made China's second-largest initial public offering of CN\u00a557.12\u00a0billion (US$7.6\u00a0billion) on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.\n\n\nThe bank is a component of Hang Seng Index, SSE 180 Index and other indexes of Pan-Chinese and Pan-Asia stock exchanges, such as CSI 300 Index, Hang Seng China 50 Index, FTSE China A50 Index and S&P Asia 50.\n\n\nThe bank was also a component of the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index.\n\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\n* *Global 2000 Rank #2* - World's Largest Public Companies in 2016[21]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Banks portal\n\n\n* Asset management in China\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** \"Annual Report 2018\" (PDF).

It was founded on 10 July 1951, and has its headquarters in Dongcheng District, Beijing.[4] It has branches throughout mainland China, Hong Kong, London, Tokyo, New York, Frankfurt, Sydney, Seoul, and Singapore.\n\n\nABC has 320 million retail customers, 2.7 million corporate clients, and nearly 24,000 branches. It is China's third-largest lender by assets. ABC went public in mid-2010, fetching the world's biggest ever initial public offering (IPO) at the time,[5] since overtaken by the Saudi Arabian state-run petroleum enterprise, Saudi Aramco.[6] In 2011, it ranked eighth among the Top 1000 World Banks,[7] by 2015, it ranked third in Forbes' 13th annual Global 2000 list[8] and in 2017 it ranked fifth.[9] It is considered a systemically important bank by the Financial Stability Board.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSince the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, ABC has been formed and abolished several times. On July 10, 1951, two banks of the Republic of China, Farmers Bank of China and Cooperation Bank, merged to form the Agricultural Cooperation Bank, which ABC regards as its ancestor. However, the bank was merged into People's Bank of China, the central bank in 1952. The first bank bearing the name Agricultural Bank of China was founded in 1955, but it was merged into the central bank in 1957. In 1963 the Chinese government formed another agricultural bank which was also merged into the central bank two years later. Today's Agricultural Bank of China was founded in February 1979. As the People's Bank of China began spinning off its commercial banking functions after 1978, ABC's focus on providing farmers with financial services increased.[10]:\u200a225\n\n\nABC was restructured to form a holding company called Agricultural Bank of China Limited.[11] It was listed on the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges in July 2010.[12]\n\n\nIn April 2007, ABC was the victim of the largest bank theft in Chinese history. This occurred when two vault managers at the Handan branch of the bank in Hebei province embezzled almost 51 million yuan (US$7.5 million).[13]\n\n\nIn 2012, ABC started a project to migrate to the Avaloq Banking System.[14][15]\n\n\nDuring the 2013 Korean crisis, the Agricultural Bank of China halted business with a North Korean bank accused by the United States of financing Pyongyang's missile and nuclear programs.[16]\n\n\n\n## 2010 initial public offering[edit]\n\n\nABC was the last of the \"big four\" banks in China to go public. In 2010, A shares and H shares of Agricultural Bank of China were listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange respectively. Each share was set to cost between 2.7RMB and 3.3RMB per share.[17] H shares were set to cost between HK$2.88 and HK$3.48 per share.[18] The final share price for the IPO launch was issued on July 7, 2010. On completion in August 2010 it became the world's biggest initial public offering (IPO) surpassing the one set by Industrial and Commercial Bank of China in 2006 of US$21.9 billion.[19] This record has since been beaten by another Chinese company, Alibaba, in 2014.[20]\n\n\nABC raised US$19.21 billion in an IPO in Hong Kong and Shanghai on July 6, 2010, before overallotment options were exercised.[21] On August 13, 2010, ABC officially completed the world's largest initial public offering, raising a total of $22.1 billion after both Shanghai and Hong Kong's over-allotments were fully exercised.[22][23] The IPO was once thought to be able to raise US$30 billion, but weaker market sentiment dampened the value.[24] Despite a 15-month low for the Chinese benchmark index, the IPO was said to have gone smoothly.[25]\n\n\nCICC, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley led the Hong Kong offering, with JPMorgan, Macquarie, Deutsche Bank and ABC's own securities unit also involved. CICC, CITIC Securities, Galaxy and Guotai Junan Securities handled the Shanghai portion. ABC sold about 40% of the Shanghai offering to 27 strategic investors, including China Life Insurance and China State Construction. They were subject to lock-up periods of 12\u201318 months. Eleven cornerstone investors were selected for its Hong Kong share offering, including Qatar Investment Authority and Kuwait Investment Authority, taking a combined $5.45 billion worth of shares.[26]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n* ![icon](image)Banks portal\n\n\n* Asset management in China\n* Banking in China\n\t+ Policy banks\n\t+ List of banks in China\n* List of companies of China\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** \"Annual Report 2018\".

It has been the second oldest bank in China still in existence after the Bank of Communications, founded in 1908. From its establishment until 1942, it issued banknotes on behalf of the Government along with the \"Big Four\" banks of the period: the Farmers Bank of China, Bank of Communications and Central Bank of the Republic of China. After the People's Republic was established in 1949, it has become a national commercial and foreign exchange professional bank. Its original central bank designation was carried on by the newly formed People's Bank of China.[7]\n\n\nAs of 31 December 2019, it was the second-largest lender in China overall and ninth-largest bank in the world by market capitalization value,[8] and it is considered a systemically important bank by the Financial Stability Board. As of the end of 2020, it was the fourth-largest bank in the world in terms of total assets, ranked after the other three Chinese banks.[9]\n\n\nThe Bank of China is legally separate from its subsidiary the Bank of China (Hong Kong), although they maintain close relations in management and administration and co-operate in several areas including reselling BOC's insurance and securities services.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nThe Bank of China's history began in 1905, when the Qing government established *Daqing Hubu* Bank[10] (\u5927\u6df8\u6236\u90e8\u9280\u884c) in Beijing, which was in 1908 renamed to *Daqing* Bank (\u5927\u6df8\u9280\u884c). When the Republic of China was established in 1912, Chen Jintao was named head of financial reform in President Sun Yat-sen's government. Chen Jintao transformed the bank into the Bank of China, becoming its founder.[11][12][13][14]\n\n\nAfter the Chinese Civil War ended in 1949, the Bank of China effectively split into two operations. Part of the bank relocated to Taiwan with the Kuomintang (KMT) government, and was privatized in 1971 to become the **International Commercial Bank of China** (\u4e2d\u570b\u570b\u969b\u5546\u696d\u9280\u884c). As the People's Bank of China began spinning off its commercial functions starting in 1978, the Bank of China became focused on international finance.[15]:\u200a225 In 2002, it merged with Jiaotong Bank (\u4ea4\u901a\u9280\u884c) to become the Mega International Commercial Bank. The Mainland operation is the current entity known as the Bank of China.\n\n\nIt is the second largest lender in China overall, and the fifth largest bank in the world by market capitalization value.[8] Once 100% owned by the central government, via China Central Huijin and National Council for Social Security Fund (SSF), an Initial public offering (IPO) of its shares took place in June 2006, the free float is at present over 26%. In the *Forbes* Global 2000 it ranked as the 4th-largest company in the world.[16]\n\n\nIt is the most globally-active of China's banks, with branches on every inhabited continent. Outside of mainland China, BOC also operates in 27 countries and areas including Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Russia, Hungary, United States, Panama, Brazil, Japan, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Bahrain, Zambia, South Africa, and a branch office in the Cayman Islands.[17] In December 2010, the Bank of China New York branch began offering renminbi products for Americans.[18] It was the first major Chinese bank to offer such a product.\n\n\nAlthough it is present in the above countries/territories, its operations outside China accounted for less than 4% of the activity of the bank by both profits and assets. Mainland China accounts for 60% of the bank by profits and 76% by assets as at December 2005.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Timeline of overseas activities[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Two-thirds of its share capital are in free float. The bank's headquarters in Hong Kong are located in the Bank of China Tower, designed by the renowned architect I.M. Pei, and was opened to the public in 1990 as the tallest building in Hong Kong at that time.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIt listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (independently from BOCHK) (SEHK:3988) by floating the largest initial public offering (IPO) in the world by any institution since 2000 on June 1, 2006, raising US$9.7 billion. The IPO attracted HK$286 billion (US$36.7 billion) in retail orders and was the most heavily oversubscribed in the history of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The offer was around 76 times oversubscribed. Although some financial analysts advised caution due to the worrying amounts of non-performing loans, this hardly deterred investors. The IPO share price started at HK$2.95 per share and jumped 15% (to HK$3.40) after the first day of trading.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 2008, the Bank of China was crowned Deal of the Year - Debt Market Deal of the Year at the 2008 ALB Hong Kong Law Awards.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Canada[edit]\n\n\n\n\nBank of China (Canada)| ![](image)Bank of China (Canada) headquarters\n |\n| Company type | Subsidiary |\n| Industry | Bank |\n| Predecessor | Bank of China Toronto Representative Office |\n| Founded | May 18, 1993[39] |\n| Headquarters | 50 Minthorn BoulevardMarkham, Ontario\n, Canada\n |\n| Areas served\n | * Ontario\n* British Columbia\n* Alberta\n |\n| Revenue | 473,912,000,000 renminbi (2015)\u00a0![Edit this on Wikidata](image) |\n| Operating income\n | 229,237,000,000 renminbi (2015)\u00a0![Edit this on Wikidata](image) |\n| Net income\n | 179,417,000,000 renminbi (2015)\u00a0![Edit this on Wikidata](image) |\n| Total assets | 16,815,597,000,000 renminbi (2015)\u00a0![Edit this on Wikidata](image) |\n| Number of employees\n | 310,042 (2015)\u00a0![Edit this on Wikidata](image) |\n| Parent | Bank of China |\n| Website | www.bankofchina.com/ca |\n\n\n![](image)A branch located in Toronto's Chinatown\n**Bank of China (Canada)**, commonly known as **BOCC**, is the Canadian subsidiary of the Bank of China (BOC). The Bank of China began its business in Canada by opening a representative office in Toronto on September 8, 1992. BOCC was incorporated as a subsidiary of BOC in 1993 under Schedule II of the Bank Act.[39] BOCC provides the following types of banking services in Canada: bank accounts to both personal and commercial banking clients, remittance services (including bank drafts and wire transfers), loans and mortgages, foreign exchange services, and China visa application assistance services where by it acts as agent, however plans for a China Visa Application Centre are being made and it is anticipated that the Consulate General of the People's Republic of China in Toronto will entrust all future China Visa applications to Bank of China Canada's Visa Application Centre.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn Canada, BOCC has ten locations located in Markham, Toronto (several branches, in downtown, North York and Scarborough], Mississauga, Vancouver, Montreal, and Calgary. It previously had branches in Burnaby and Richmond. As well, the bank is a member of the Canadian Bankers Association (CBA); registered member with the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC), a federal agency insuring deposits at all of Canada's chartered banks; and, a member of Interac, which handles transactions between automated teller machines of different banks and debit card transactions.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Banknotes[edit]\n\n\nAlthough it is not a central bank, the Bank of China is licensed to issue banknotes in two of China's Special Administrative Regions. Until 1942, the Bank of China issued banknotes in mainland China on behalf of the Government of the Republic of China.

However, with Export-Import Bank of China, they refused to pay this; only Deutsche Bank honoured its obligations under the court decision.[44]\n\n\n\n### Wultz v. Bank of China[edit]\n\n\nOn August 8, 2008, the family of Daniel Wultz, an American teenager killed in a 2006 terrorist attack in Israel, filed suit against the Bank of China in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The case was subsequently transferred to the United States District Court, Southern District of New York, where litigation continues. On October 29, 2012, the Honorable J. Scheindlin issued a ruling compelling Bank of China to provide discovery.[45][46][47]\n\n\n\n### Alleged money transfers to Hamas[edit]\n\n\nIn 2012, the families of eight terror victims of the 2008 Mercaz HaRav massacre in Jerusalem filed a $1 billion lawsuit against the Bank of China. The suit asserted that in 2003 the bank's New York branch wired millions of dollars to Hamas from its leadership in Syria and Iran. The Bank of China subsequently denied providing banking services to terrorist groups: \"The Bank of China has always strictly followed the UN's anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing requirements and regulations in China and other judicial areas where we operate.\"[48][49][50]\n\n\n\n### Money laundering[edit]\n\n\nIn 2014 BOC denied China Central Television reports of money laundering.[51]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Banks portal\n* ![flag](image)China portal\n* ![flag](image)Taiwan portal\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n\n\n* List of largest banks\n* List of asset management companies of the People's Republic of China\n* Foreign exchange reserves of the People's Republic of China\n* BOC Aviation - Singapore-based aircraft leasing company owned by BOC\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Corporate Information, Bank of China, https://pic.bankofchina.com/bocappd/report/201104/P020110427563098317418.pdf Archived 2021-05-09 at the Wayback Machine\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** \"Annual Report 2018\" (PDF).

MUFG holds assets of around US$3.1 trillion as of 2016 and is one of the \"Three Great Houses\" of the Mitsubishi Group[6] alongside Mitsubishi Corporation and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nThe company was formed on October 1, 2005, with the merger of Tokyo-based Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group (MTFG), and Osaka-based UFJ Holdings.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe core banking units of the group, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi and UFJ Bank, were merged on January 1, 2006, to form MUFG Bank. This integration was originally scheduled to take place on October 1, 2005, the same day that the parent companies were merged. However, pressure from Japan's Financial Services Agency, which wanted to ensure the smooth systems integration of the two banking giants, caused the merger of the banks to be postponed for three months. The trust banking and securities units of MTFG and UFJ were merged according to the original schedule on October 1, 2005.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nOn October 31, 2018, MUFG to acquire Australian Asset Manager, Colonial First State Global Asset Management.[7]\n\n\n\n### Senior leadership[edit]\n\n\n* *Chairman:* Kanetsugu Mike (since April 2021)\n* *Chief Executive:* Hironori Kamezawa (Since April 2021)\n\n\n#### List of former chairmen[edit]\n\n\n1.

Nobuyuki Hirano (2013\u20132019)[10]\n4. Kanetsugu Mike (2019\u20132021)\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nThe financial group dates back to 1880 as the Yokohama Specie Bank, later renamed to The Bank of Tokyo. Also in 1880, The Mitsubishi Bank, Ltd. was founded by former samurai Yataro Iwasaki. In 1919, the Mitsubishi Bank financed the Mitsubishi *zaibatsu*, most of which is today Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. After the Second World War the Mitsubishi Keiretsu was broken up under US imposed laws, and Mitsubishi Bank took on greater independence, albeit still central to the financing of the growth of the Mitsubishi group of companies.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn April 1996, The Mitsubishi Bank, Ltd. and The Bank of Tokyo, Ltd. merged. The Bank of Tokyo had been set up by the Japanese Government to act as Japan's international bank, and solely responsible for all Yen forex trading. Uniquely in Japan, with no *keiretsu*, Bank of Tokyo was an ideal partner for Mitsubishi Bank, complementing the latter' strong domestic franchise with a unique international footprint. Additionally, during Japan's lost decade of economic stagnation, this marriage of two relatively strong banks was seen as a positive step in cleaning up the country's moribund banking sector.\n\n\nIn July 2004, Japan's fourth-largest financial group UFJ Holdings offered to merge with the Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group. The merger of the two bank holding companies was completed on October 1, 2005. UFJ was created from a merger with the Toyo Trust and Banking. UFJ was accused by the government of corruption and making bad loans to the yakuza crime syndicates.\n\n\nThe takeover of UFJ by the Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group was challenged by the Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Group, another of Japan's large banking groups, which launched a competing takeover bid. The Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group ultimately prevailed in the fight to acquire UFJ. The battle between the two Japanese mega-banks seemed to signal an end to the clubby atmosphere that had prevailed in Japan's postwar banking industry.[11]\n\n\nThe trust banking and securities units of the two groups were merged on October 1, 2005. The core banking units of MTFG and UFJ, The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Ltd. and UFJ Bank, respectively, continued to operate separately until January 1, 2006, when they were merged to form MUFG Bank.\n\n\nIn September 2008, MUFG signed a letter of intent with Morgan Stanley to form an alliance and purchase 20% of the American firm.[12]\n\n\nIn 2008 at the *2008 ALB Japan Law Awards*,[13] Mitsubishi UFJ was crowned:\n\n\n\n* In-House of the Year \u2013 Japan Investment Bank In-House Team of the Year\n* Deal of the Year \u2013 Debt Market Deal of the Year\n\n\nIn April 2011, MUFG and Morgan Stanley entered into an agreement to convert MUFG's outstanding convertible preferred stock in Morgan Stanley into Morgan Stanley stock.[14]\n\n\n\n### Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group, Inc.[edit]\n\n\n![](image)MTFG Plaza is an office building of the Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group.\n**Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group, Inc.** (**MTFG**; \u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e\u4e09\u83f1\u6771\u4eac\u30d5\u30a3\u30ca\u30f3\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30fb\u30b0\u30eb\u30fc\u30d7, *Kabushiki kaisha mitsubishi t\u014dky\u014d finansharu gur\u016bpu*) was one of Japan's largest banks ranked by assets (an estimated US$1 trillion), second only to Mizuho Holdings. On October 1, 2005, MTFG completed the acquisition of UFJ Holdings, Japan's fourth largest banking group, to form the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the world's largest bank ranked by assets with \u00a5190 trillion (approximately $1.7 trillion).\n\n\nMTFG was widely considered financially the strongest of Japan's large banks, with non-performing loans down to 2.9% of assets.\n\n\n\n### UFJ Holdings, Inc.[edit]\n\n\n**UFJ Holdings, Inc.** (\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793eUFJ\u30db\u30fc\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30b9; *kabushikigaisha UFJ h\u014drudingusu*) was the weakest among the three major banking groups in Japan. *UFJ*, an abbreviation of *United Financial of Japan*, was formed from a merger of Sanwa Bank and Tokai Bank with the Toyo Trust & Banking Co. Ltd, a part of the Toyota Motor Corporation. At the time, it was one of the largest shareholders of Toyota. The Chairman of Toyota was a director on its board during the financial scandals and indictments of three UFJ executives. The banking crisis led to its merger, after being one of the world's greatest losing corporations, on October 1, 2005, with the Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group to form the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group.\n\n\nFormed April 1, 2001, with the merger of Sanwa Bank, Tokai Bank, and Toyo Trust and Banking.\n\n\nIn July 2004, UFJ announced plans to merge with the Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group. The merger was completed on October 1, 2005, creating the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, the world's second biggest bank by assets at $1.7 trillion, trailing behind Citigroup with $2.4 trillion in assets.\n\n\nIn June 2011, MUFG took a 9.99 percent stake in Lynas Corp, an Australian rare earths developer.[15]\n\n\n\n## Group companies[edit]\n\n\n### Commercial bank[edit]\n\n\n* MUFG Bank, Ltd.\n* Bank of Ayudhya, bank in Thailand\n* Security Bank, semi-major bank in the Philippines.\n* Vietinbank, Vietnamese bank.\n* Bank Danamon, bank in Indonesia.\n* Jibun Bank Corporation\u00a0[ja], online.\n\n\n### Associated companies[edit]\n\n\n* Trust bank\n\t+ Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking Corporation\n* Microfinance\n\t+ Hattha Kaksekar (Cambodia microfinance institution)\n* Securities\n\t+ Mitsubishi UFJ Securities Holdings\u00a0[ja] (intermediate holding company)\n\t\t- Mitsubishi UFJ Securities (a retail joint venture between with Morgan Stanley)\n\t\t- Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities Co., Ltd.\u00a0[ja] (a joint venture between MUFG and Morgan Stanley)\n\t\t- Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley PB Securities Co., Ltd.\u00a0[ja] (private banking brokerage business entities)\n\t\t- kabu.com Securities Co., Ltd.\u00a0[ja] (Internet-only securities)\n\n\n* Lease\n\t+ Mitsubishi UFJ Lease & Finance Company Limited\u00a0[ja]\n\t+ BOT Lease Co., Ltd.\u00a0[ja]\n\t+ Hitachi Capital Corporation\u00a0[ja]\n* Research and consulting\n\t+ Mitsubishi UFJ Research and Consulting Co.,Ltd\u00a0[ja]\n\t+ Mitsubishi Asset Brains\n\t+ Mitsubishi UFJ Trust Investment Engineering Laboratory\n* System\n\t+ Mitsubishi Research Institute DCS\n\t+ Mitsubishi UFJ Information Technology, Ltd.\u00a0[ja]\n\t+ Mitsubishi UFJ Trust Systems Co.,Ltd.\u00a0[ja]\n\t+ MUS information Systems Co.,Ltd.\u00a0[ja]\n\t+ MU Business Engineering\n* Asset management\n\t+ The Master Trust Bank of Japan\n* Asset Management\n\t+ Mitsubishi UFJ Kokusai Asset Management Co., Ltd.\u00a0[ja]\n\t+ MU Investment Advisor\n\t+ MUFG Investor Services\n* Venture capital\n\t+ Mitsubishi UFJ Capital\n* Wealth management\n\t+ Mitsubishi UFJ Wealth Management Securities\n\t+ Mitsubishi UFJ Personal Financial Advisors\n* Factoring\n\t+ Mitsubishi UFJ Factor\n* Securities agency\n\t+ Japan share holder service\n* Banking agency\n\t+ Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Partners\n* Foreign currency exchange\n\t+ Tokyo Credit Services,Ltd.\u00a0[ja]\n* Consumer finance\n\t+ Acom (equity-method affiliate)\n* Cards and credit sales\n\t+ Mitsubishi UFJ NICOS\n\t+ RYOSHIN DCCARD CO.,LTD.\u00a0[ja]\n\t+ JACCS CO., LTD.
