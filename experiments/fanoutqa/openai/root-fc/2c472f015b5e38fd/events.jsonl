Inhabited since the Neolithic, Incheon was home to just 4,700 people when it became an international port in 1883. Today, about 3 million people live in the city, making it South Korea's third-most-populous city after Seoul and Busan.[3]\n\n\nThe city's growth has been assured in modern times with the development of its port due to its natural advantages as a coastal city and its proximity to the South Korean capital. It is part of the Seoul Capital Area, along with Seoul itself and Gyeonggi Province, forming the world's fourth-largest metropolitan area by population.\n\n\nIncheon has since led the economic development of South Korea by opening its port to the outside world, ushering in the modernization of South Korea as a center of industrialization. In 2003, the city was designated as South Korea's first free economic zone.[*citation needed*] Since then, large local companies and global enterprises have increasingly invested in the Incheon Free Economic Zone, including Samsung which chose Songdo International City as its new investment destination for its bio industry.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAs an international city, Incheon has held numerous large-scale international conferences, such as the Incheon Global Fair & Festival in 2009. The 17th Asian Games Incheon 2014 was also held in Incheon on 19 September 2014. Incheon has established itself[*clarification needed*] as a major transportation hub in northeast Asia with the Incheon International Airport and Incheon Port.[*citation needed*] The large volume of port traffic makes Incheon a Large-Port Metropolis using the Southampton System of Port-City classification.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nThe first historical record of the Incheon area dates back to 475 CE, during the reign of King Jangsu of Goguryeo, by the name of **Michuhol**, which is supposed to be located on today's Munhak Hill (문학산). The area underwent several name changes with successive kingdoms and dynasties. In Goryeo era, Incheon was called **Gyeongwon** (경원) or **Inju** (인주). The current name was turned to Incheon in 1413. [*citation needed*] Later, Incheon County became Incheon Metropolitan Prefecture (dohobu, 도호부). Old Incheon consisted of today's southern Incheon (i.e. Jung-gu, Dong-gu, Nam-gu, Yeonsu-gu, and Namdong-gu) and the northern part of Siheung City. The city center was Gwangyo-dong, where the prefecture office (도호부청사) and the local academy (hyanggyo, 향교) were located. The \"original\" two remaining buildings of the Incheon prefecture office are located in Munhak Elementary School, while the newly built (in 2001) prefecture office buildings are right across from Munhak Baseball Stadium.\n\n\n\n### Modern history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jemulpo in 1890\nAnother historical name of the city, **Jemulpo** (alternatively Romanized as **Chemulpo**), was not widely used until the opening of the port in 1883. It was frequently used until the Japanese annexation.[5][6] After the opening of the Incheon port, the city center moved from Gwangyo to Jemulpo. Today, either Jemulpo or Gwangyo-dong is considered \"Original Incheon\" (원인천). It was internationally known as **Jinsen** during Japanese rule, based on the Japanese pronunciation of Incheon's Chinese name. \n\n\nIn 1914, the Japanese colonial government merged outer parts of old Incheon (including the former center of Gwangyo) with Bupyeong County, forming Bucheon County.[7] Between 1936 and 1940, some part of Bucheon County was recombined into Incheon City, by which some part of \"old\" Bupyeong was annexed into Incheon.\n\n\nIncheon was originally part of Gyeonggi Province, but was granted *Directly Governed* (now Metropolitan) City status on 1 July 1981; the city officially separated from the province. In 1989, neighboring islands and Gyeyang township of Gimpo County[a] were ceded to Incheon and in 1995 Geomdan township of Gimpo County and two counties of Ganghwa and Onjin were annexed to Incheon Metropolitan City.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIncheon was known as **Inchon** prior to South Korea's adoption of a new Romanization system in 2000.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Juan-dong, Incheon attacked with tear gas in May 1987\n### Major events[edit]\n\n\nThe city was the site of the Battle of Chemulpo Bay, where the first shots of the Russo-Japanese War were fired.\n\n\nDuring the Korean War, Incheon was occupied by North Korean troops on 4 July 1950. Incheon was the site of the Battle of Inchon when the United States troops landed to relieve pressure on the Pusan Perimeter and to launch a United Nations offensive northward. The result was a decisive UN victory and it was recaptured on 19 September 1950.[8] USS *Inchon* was named after the tide-turning battle that ensued.\n\n\nPrior to and during the June Democratic Movement in 1987, Incheon was the site of several pro-democracy protests. \n\n\nIncheon has also hosted a series of major international events. The Global Fair & Festival 2009 Incheon was held in the Songdo District in August 2009. It was open from 7 August to 25 October for a period of 80 days. It was a comprehensive international event with global institutions and corporations as participants. Various musicians and artists performed during the event.\n\n\nThe city hosted a meeting of the G20 Finance Ministers in February 2010.[9] Incheon was the site of the third Global Model United Nations Conference, held from 10 to 14 August 2011.\n\n\nIt first hosted the Incheon Women Artists' Biennale in 2004 which expanded into welcoming international artists in its subsequent 2007, 2009[10] and 2011.\n\n\nIncheon hosted the Asian Games in 2014.[11] It hosted the 6th OECD World Forum in 2018.[12]\n\n\nIncheon was designated as the World Book Capital for the year 2015 by UNESCO.[13]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nOn 27 February 2007, Incheon declared itself an \"English City,\" and inaugurated the \"Incheon Free English Zone\" program. The goal of the program is to make the city as proficient in English as Singapore.[14] This is for the ultimate purpose of establishing Incheon as a commercial and business hub of northeast Asia (see Free Economic Zone below). The official slogan of the program is \"Smile with English.\"[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Higher education[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Universities and colleges in Incheon\n\nIncheon is home to a number of colleges and universities:\n\n\n\n* George Mason University Korea Campus\n* Ghent University Global Campus\n* Gyeongin National University of Education Incheon campus\n* Inha University (formerly Inha Institute of Technology)\n* Gachon University Medical·Ganghwa campus\n* Gyeongin Women's College\n* Inha Technical College\n* Incheon Catholic University\n* Incheon City College\n* Incheon National University\n* Jaineung College\n* University of Utah Asia Campus\n* SUNY South Korea\n* Anyang University Ganghwa campus\n* Yonsei University International campus\n* Korea Polytechnics II\n* Seongsan Hyo University\n* Juan International University\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\nIncheon has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: *Cwa*),[15] and humid continental climate[16] (Köppen *Dwa*, respectively). Like other metropolitan cities, incheon has a strong urban heat island effect.[17] Incheon's climate is about average compared to the rest of Korea, with 8 locations being cooler and 10 locations being warmer, and with 9 locations being wetter and 9 locations being drier.[18]\n\n\nIncheon experiences each of its four seasons, distinctly feeling the rise and fall of temperature and humidity. The temperature however, never rises to an extreme, and the climate of the city is essentially mild. Incheon is swept by the seasonal winds as the northwesterly winds strike the city in the winter and the summer in Incheon is affected by gusts of the warm southwesterly winds.[19]\n\n\n\n| Climate

During the industrialization of South Korea, several industrial complexes were built throughout the city, and as a result, the city was largely dependent on manufacturing industry. But with the designation of Incheon Free Economic Zone in 2003, the city is now making an effort to foster new growth industries. Major industrial parks include Bupyeong industrial complex, which hosts GM Incheon plant(formerly a GM Daewoo Incheon plant), Juan industrial complex, and Namdong Industrial complex.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn recent years, bio industry is emerging as a new growth industry of the city.[*citation needed*] Currently, with the total production capacity of 330kℓ per year, the city ranks 2nd in the world by production capacity along with San Francisco, United States.[*citation needed*] The capacity is under expansion, and after completion in 2018, the city will rank 1st with the production capacity of 510kℓ.[23] Also, logistics industry is also experiencing a rapid growth, thanks to Incheon Airport, which was ranked fourth in the world by cargo traffic, and the expansion of Incheon Port.\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\nIncheon is a major domestic and international transport hub for Korea.\n\n\n\n![](image)Inside Incheon International Airport\n### Air[edit]\n\n\nIncheon International Airport is South Korea's primary international airport and a regional air hub. In 2015, it was the world's 22nd busiest airport by passenger traffic, with 49,412,750 passengers.[24]\n\n\nThere were a total of 305,446 flights (300,634 international, 4,812 domestic) to and from Incheon International Airport in 2015, an average of 837 flights (824 international, 13 domestic) daily. Korea's two main carriers, Korean Air and Asiana Airlines, serviced 50.9% of flights, while low-cost and foreign carriers serviced the remaining 49.1% of flights.[25] The airport is experiencing a rapid increase in passengers, and the opening of Terminal 2 in December 2017 spurred additional traffic.\n\n\nThe airport was also featured in the Korean drama series, \"Air City.\"\n\n\nIncheon International Airport ranked \"5th in the world\" among international airports.[26][*when?*][*needs update*]\n\n\n\n### Sea[edit]\n\n\nIncheon's sea port is the second largest port in Korea after Busan Port.\n\n\nThe International Passenger Terminal located at the port offers ferries to five cities in China: Dalian, Qingdao, Tianjin, Dandong, and Weihai. There are also ferries to Incheon's outlying islands as well as Baengnyeong Island inside of the Northern Limit Line.\n\n\n\n### Bus[edit]\n\n\nIncheon Bus Terminal, located at its eponymous subway stop, offers express bus transportation to all parts of Korea. Many city bus lines offer transportation within city limits as well as to the neighboring cities of Bucheon, Gimpo, Seoul, and Siheung.\n\n\nMany intercity buses offer transportation between Seoul and Incheon.\n\n\n\n### Train[edit]\n\n\nLocal service to Guro, Seoul, Cheongnyangni, Uijeongbu and Soyosan is offered by Seoul's subway Line 1. The line has 11 stations within Incheon and connects to the Incheon Subway at Bupyeong and Juan stations.\n\n\nRapid service on the same line to Yongsan station in Seoul depart from Dongincheon station and stops at major stations.\n\n\nThe Airport Express (AREX) line runs from Incheon International Airport to Seoul Station via Gimpo International Airport. The Incheon-Gimpo section was opened in March 2007 and was extended to Seoul station in December 2010. Passengers can choose a high-speed service stopping only at Incheon airport and Seoul, which takes 43 minutes but departs only every half-hour; or the all-station service which takes 53 minutes but leaves every six minutes.\n\n\nKTX service was introduced on the AREX line on 30 June 2014, with stops at Incheon International Airport station and Geomam station. There are additional plans to use the newly built Suin Line to bring KTX service to Incheon station by 2021.[27]\n\n\n\n### Subway[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Incheon Subway\n\nThe Incheon Subway has two subway lines serving the city. The first line connects to the Seoul Metropolitan Subway system at Bupyeong station (Seoul Subway Line 1), and AREX line at Gyeyang station. It connects International Business District station in Songdo to Gyeyang station. The line has 28 stations on 29.4 kilometres (18.3 miles) of track. The line also has transfer stations with the Suin Line at Woninjae station, with the Incheon Subway Line 2 at Incheon City Hall station, and with Seoul Subway Line 7 at Bupyeong-gu Office station. Incheon Subway Line 2 opened in July 2016 and runs from Geomdan Oryu station to Unyeon station. The automated line is 29.2 kilometres (18.1 miles) long, and has 27 stations, including transfer stations at Geomam station with the AREX line, Juan station with Seoul Subway Line 1 and Incheon Subway Line 2 at Incheon City Hall station.\n\n\nThe Incheon subway is operated by the Incheon Rapid Transit Corporation (IRTC).\n\n\nThere are additional plans for a third subway line in Incheon.\n\n\nKorail has also constructed a new commuter rail line named Suin Line. The line opened in 2012 from Oido station in Siheung to Songdo station in Incheon. It was then extended in 2016, and now reaches Incheon station where passengers can transfer to Seoul Subway Line 1. In 2020, the line was extended from Oido station to Suwon Station.\n\n\nSMRT (one of three operating companies of Seoul Metropolitan Subway) has extended Seoul Metropolitan Subway Line 7 to Bupyeong-gu office by 2011 and provided transfers to the Incheon Subway system. It has 3 stations within Incheon. By 2020, the line will further be extended westwards to Seoknam station where it will be possible to transfer to Incheon Subway Line 2.\n\n\n\n## Free Economic Zone[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section contains wording that **promotes the subject in a subjective manner without imparting real information**.

Inhabited since the Neolithic, Incheon was home to just 4,700 people when it became an international port in 1883. Today, about 3 million people live in the city, making it South Korea's third-most-populous city after Seoul and Busan.[3]\n\n\nThe city's growth has been assured in modern times with the development of its port due to its natural advantages as a coastal city and its proximity to the South Korean capital. It is part of the Seoul Capital Area, along with Seoul itself and Gyeonggi Province, forming the world's fourth-largest metropolitan area by population.\n\n\nIncheon has since led the economic development of South Korea by opening its port to the outside world, ushering in the modernization of South Korea as a center of industrialization. In 2003, the city was designated as South Korea's first free economic zone.[*citation needed*] Since then, large local companies and global enterprises have increasingly invested in the Incheon Free Economic Zone, including Samsung which chose Songdo International City as its new investment destination for its bio industry.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAs an international city, Incheon has held numerous large-scale international conferences, such as the Incheon Global Fair & Festival in 2009. The 17th Asian Games Incheon 2014 was also held in Incheon on 19 September 2014. Incheon has established itself[*clarification needed*] as a major transportation hub in northeast Asia with the Incheon International Airport and Incheon Port.[*citation needed*] The large volume of port traffic makes Incheon a Large-Port Metropolis using the Southampton System of Port-City classification.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nThe first historical record of the Incheon area dates back to 475 CE, during the reign of King Jangsu of Goguryeo, by the name of **Michuhol**, which is supposed to be located on today's Munhak Hill (문학산). The area underwent several name changes with successive kingdoms and dynasties. In Goryeo era, Incheon was called **Gyeongwon** (경원) or **Inju** (인주). The current name was turned to Incheon in 1413. [*citation needed*] Later, Incheon County became Incheon Metropolitan Prefecture (dohobu, 도호부). Old Incheon consisted of today's southern Incheon (i.e. Jung-gu, Dong-gu, Nam-gu, Yeonsu-gu, and Namdong-gu) and the northern part of Siheung City. The city center was Gwangyo-dong, where the prefecture office (도호부청사) and the local academy (hyanggyo, 향교) were located. The \"original\" two remaining buildings of the Incheon prefecture office are located in Munhak Elementary School, while the newly built (in 2001) prefecture office buildings are right across from Munhak Baseball Stadium.\n\n\n\n### Modern history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jemulpo in 1890\nAnother historical name of the city, **Jemulpo** (alternatively Romanized as **Chemulpo**), was not widely used until the opening of the port in 1883. It was frequently used until the Japanese annexation.[5][6] After the opening of the Incheon port, the city center moved from Gwangyo to Jemulpo. Today, either Jemulpo or Gwangyo-dong is considered \"Original Incheon\" (원인천). It was internationally known as **Jinsen** during Japanese rule, based on the Japanese pronunciation of Incheon's Chinese name. \n\n\nIn 1914, the Japanese colonial government merged outer parts of old Incheon (including the former center of Gwangyo) with Bupyeong County, forming Bucheon County.[7] Between 1936 and 1940, some part of Bucheon County was recombined into Incheon City, by which some part of \"old\" Bupyeong was annexed into Incheon.\n\n\nIncheon was originally part of Gyeonggi Province, but was granted *Directly Governed* (now Metropolitan) City status on 1 July 1981; the city officially separated from the province. In 1989, neighboring islands and Gyeyang township of Gimpo County[a] were ceded to Incheon and in 1995 Geomdan township of Gimpo County and two counties of Ganghwa and Onjin were annexed to Incheon Metropolitan City.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIncheon was known as **Inchon** prior to South Korea's adoption of a new Romanization system in 2000.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Juan-dong, Incheon attacked with tear gas in May 1987\n### Major events[edit]\n\n\nThe city was the site of the Battle of Chemulpo Bay, where the first shots of the Russo-Japanese War were fired.\n\n\nDuring the Korean War, Incheon was occupied by North Korean troops on 4 July 1950. Incheon was the site of the Battle of Inchon when the United States troops landed to relieve pressure on the Pusan Perimeter and to launch a United Nations offensive northward. The result was a decisive UN victory and it was recaptured on 19 September 1950.[8] USS *Inchon* was named after the tide-turning battle that ensued.\n\n\nPrior to and during the June Democratic Movement in 1987, Incheon was the site of several pro-democracy protests. \n\n\nIncheon has also hosted a series of major international events. The Global Fair & Festival 2009 Incheon was held in the Songdo District in August 2009. It was open from 7 August to 25 October for a period of 80 days. It was a comprehensive international event with global institutions and corporations as participants. Various musicians and artists performed during the event.\n\n\nThe city hosted a meeting of the G20 Finance Ministers in February 2010.[9] Incheon was the site of the third Global Model United Nations Conference, held from 10 to 14 August 2011.\n\n\nIt first hosted the Incheon Women Artists' Biennale in 2004 which expanded into welcoming international artists in its subsequent 2007, 2009[10] and 2011.\n\n\nIncheon hosted the Asian Games in 2014.[11] It hosted the 6th OECD World Forum in 2018.[12]\n\n\nIncheon was designated as the World Book Capital for the year 2015 by UNESCO.[13]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nOn 27 February 2007, Incheon declared itself an \"English City,\" and inaugurated the \"Incheon Free English Zone\" program. The goal of the program is to make the city as proficient in English as Singapore.[14] This is for the ultimate purpose of establishing Incheon as a commercial and business hub of northeast Asia (see Free Economic Zone below). The official slogan of the program is \"Smile with English.\"[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Higher education[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Universities and colleges in Incheon\n\nIncheon is home to a number of colleges and universities:\n\n\n\n* George Mason University Korea Campus\n* Ghent University Global Campus\n* Gyeongin National University of Education Incheon campus\n* Inha University (formerly Inha Institute of Technology)\n* Gachon University Medical·Ganghwa campus\n* Gyeongin Women's College\n* Inha Technical College\n* Incheon Catholic University\n* Incheon City College\n* Incheon National University\n* Jaineung College\n* University of Utah Asia Campus\n* SUNY South Korea\n* Anyang University Ganghwa campus\n* Yonsei University International campus\n* Korea Polytechnics II\n* Seongsan Hyo University\n* Juan International University\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\nIncheon has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: *Cwa*),[15] and humid continental climate[16] (Köppen *Dwa*, respectively). Like other metropolitan cities, incheon has a strong urban heat island effect.[17] Incheon's climate is about average compared to the rest of Korea, with 8 locations being cooler and 10 locations being warmer, and with 9 locations being wetter and 9 locations being drier.[18]\n\n\nIncheon experiences each of its four seasons, distinctly feeling the rise and fall of temperature and humidity. The temperature however, never rises to an extreme, and the climate of the city is essentially mild. Incheon is swept by the seasonal winds as the northwesterly winds strike the city in the winter and the summer in Incheon is affected by gusts of the warm southwesterly winds.[19]\n\n\n\n| Climate

During the industrialization of South Korea, several industrial complexes were built throughout the city, and as a result, the city was largely dependent on manufacturing industry. But with the designation of Incheon Free Economic Zone in 2003, the city is now making an effort to foster new growth industries. Major industrial parks include Bupyeong industrial complex, which hosts GM Incheon plant(formerly a GM Daewoo Incheon plant), Juan industrial complex, and Namdong Industrial complex.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn recent years, bio industry is emerging as a new growth industry of the city.[*citation needed*] Currently, with the total production capacity of 330kℓ per year, the city ranks 2nd in the world by production capacity along with San Francisco, United States.[*citation needed*] The capacity is under expansion, and after completion in 2018, the city will rank 1st with the production capacity of 510kℓ.[23] Also, logistics industry is also experiencing a rapid growth, thanks to Incheon Airport, which was ranked fourth in the world by cargo traffic, and the expansion of Incheon Port.\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\nIncheon is a major domestic and international transport hub for Korea.\n\n\n\n![](image)Inside Incheon International Airport\n### Air[edit]\n\n\nIncheon International Airport is South Korea's primary international airport and a regional air hub. In 2015, it was the world's 22nd busiest airport by passenger traffic, with 49,412,750 passengers.[24]\n\n\nThere were a total of 305,446 flights (300,634 international, 4,812 domestic) to and from Incheon International Airport in 2015, an average of 837 flights (824 international, 13 domestic) daily. Korea's two main carriers, Korean Air and Asiana Airlines, serviced 50.9% of flights, while low-cost and foreign carriers serviced the remaining 49.1% of flights.[25] The airport is experiencing a rapid increase in passengers, and the opening of Terminal 2 in December 2017 spurred additional traffic.\n\n\nThe airport was also featured in the Korean drama series, \"Air City.\"\n\n\nIncheon International Airport ranked \"5th in the world\" among international airports.[26][*when?*][*needs update*]\n\n\n\n### Sea[edit]\n\n\nIncheon's sea port is the second largest port in Korea after Busan Port.\n\n\nThe International Passenger Terminal located at the port offers ferries to five cities in China: Dalian, Qingdao, Tianjin, Dandong, and Weihai. There are also ferries to Incheon's outlying islands as well as Baengnyeong Island inside of the Northern Limit Line.\n\n\n\n### Bus[edit]\n\n\nIncheon Bus Terminal, located at its eponymous subway stop, offers express bus transportation to all parts of Korea. Many city bus lines offer transportation within city limits as well as to the neighboring cities of Bucheon, Gimpo, Seoul, and Siheung.\n\n\nMany intercity buses offer transportation between Seoul and Incheon.\n\n\n\n### Train[edit]\n\n\nLocal service to Guro, Seoul, Cheongnyangni, Uijeongbu and Soyosan is offered by Seoul's subway Line 1. The line has 11 stations within Incheon and connects to the Incheon Subway at Bupyeong and Juan stations.\n\n\nRapid service on the same line to Yongsan station in Seoul depart from Dongincheon station and stops at major stations.\n\n\nThe Airport Express (AREX) line runs from Incheon International Airport to Seoul Station via Gimpo International Airport. The Incheon-Gimpo section was opened in March 2007 and was extended to Seoul station in December 2010. Passengers can choose a high-speed service stopping only at Incheon airport and Seoul, which takes 43 minutes but departs only every half-hour; or the all-station service which takes 53 minutes but leaves every six minutes.\n\n\nKTX service was introduced on the AREX line on 30 June 2014, with stops at Incheon International Airport station and Geomam station. There are additional plans to use the newly built Suin Line to bring KTX service to Incheon station by 2021.[27]\n\n\n\n### Subway[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Incheon Subway\n\nThe Incheon Subway has two subway lines serving the city. The first line connects to the Seoul Metropolitan Subway system at Bupyeong station (Seoul Subway Line 1), and AREX line at Gyeyang station. It connects International Business District station in Songdo to Gyeyang station. The line has 28 stations on 29.4 kilometres (18.3 miles) of track. The line also has transfer stations with the Suin Line at Woninjae station, with the Incheon Subway Line 2 at Incheon City Hall station, and with Seoul Subway Line 7 at Bupyeong-gu Office station. Incheon Subway Line 2 opened in July 2016 and runs from Geomdan Oryu station to Unyeon station. The automated line is 29.2 kilometres (18.1 miles) long, and has 27 stations, including transfer stations at Geomam station with the AREX line, Juan station with Seoul Subway Line 1 and Incheon Subway Line 2 at Incheon City Hall station.\n\n\nThe Incheon subway is operated by the Incheon Rapid Transit Corporation (IRTC).\n\n\nThere are additional plans for a third subway line in Incheon.\n\n\nKorail has also constructed a new commuter rail line named Suin Line. The line opened in 2012 from Oido station in Siheung to Songdo station in Incheon. It was then extended in 2016, and now reaches Incheon station where passengers can transfer to Seoul Subway Line 1. In 2020, the line was extended from Oido station to Suwon Station.\n\n\nSMRT (one of three operating companies of Seoul Metropolitan Subway) has extended Seoul Metropolitan Subway Line 7 to Bupyeong-gu office by 2011 and provided transfers to the Incheon Subway system. It has 3 stations within Incheon. By 2020, the line will further be extended westwards to Seoknam station where it will be possible to transfer to Incheon Subway Line 2.\n\n\n\n## Free Economic Zone[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section contains wording that **promotes the subject in a subjective manner without imparting real information**.

The city is home to 23 universities and colleges, including Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) and Chungnam National University, as well as government research institutes, and research and development centers for global companies such as Samsung, LG, mostly located in the city's Daedeok Science Town.[6][7]\n\n\nOccupied by humans since the Stone Age, Daejeon was historically a collection of small riverside villages.[8] Though the area had varying degrees of strategic importance depending on the period in history, it was largely undeveloped until its use as a rail hub from the early 1900s, during the period of Japanese occupation.[9] From the 1980s, multiple national administrative functions were moved from Seoul to Daejeon, most of which are now located in the Daejeon Government Complex, resulting in another population increase.[10] The city hosted the 1986 Asian Games, the Taejon Expo '93, the International Mathematical Olympiads in 2000, and was elevated to the status of Metropolitan City in 2005.[11][12]\n\n\nDaejeon is situated in a lowland valley with three major rivers, all of them eventually flowing into the Yellow Sea by way of the Geum river. The city is surrounded by several small mountains, and is located approximately 170 km (105.6 mi) south of Seoul and 290 km (180 mi) north of Busan, and 70 km (43 mi) east of the Yellow Sea.[13] Daejeon experiences a monsoon-influenced, four-season climate with wet, hot summers and drier, cold winters.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nHuman beings first settled in the Daejeon region during the Stone Age. It was occupied and in use as strategic military ground in various times by people such as the *Usul-gun* of Baekje, *Bipung-gun* of Silla, and the *Hoideok-hyeon*, *Yuseong-hyeon*, *Deokjin-hyeon*, and *Jinjam-hyeon*. During the Joseon Kingdom period, it remained occupied by the *Hoideok-hyeon* and *Jinjam-hyeon* of Gongju Mokha. In 1895, most of the area was made part of Hoideok-gun and Jinjam-gun, excluding some parts that belonged to Gongju-gun.\n\n\nThe Daejeon area was historically known as *Hanbat* (한밭),[14] a native Korean term for \"large field\", during the Joseon Dynasty. \"Daejeon\" simply means the same thing in Hanja. In the 19th century, Daejeon was also known in English as Kung-tsiou.[15]\n\n\nHistorically, Daejeon was a small village without many residents. However, in 1905, the Gyeongbu Railway began operations from Seoul to Busan, opening a station at Daejeon. In 1926 under the rule of the Japanese government, the Honam Railway was built between Mokpo and Daejeon, transforming the latter into a major transportation hub. Because of its location and proximity to means of transportation, Daejeon grew quickly.[9]\n\n\n\n![](image)Eunhaeng-Sunhwa neighborhood (Kasuga-Cho), c. 1920\nAs railroads were laid under Japanese rule, an environment friendly to the Japanese was created, and many Japanese began to settle in Daejeon taking advantage of the opportunity. According to 1910 census data, 58%, or more than half of the 4,350 Daejeon population at the time, were Japanese. In 1925, 56% of the 8,861 people in Daejeon were Japanese. Therefore, Daejeon was one of the cities with great cultural influence of Japanese residents. For example, elderly people who experienced Japanese colonial era pronounce '단무지' (Pickled radish, danmuji) as '닥광/단광'(dakgwang/dangwang), '컵' (cup, keob) as '고뿌' (goffu) and '비닐' (vinyl, binil) as '비니루' (binilu). In addition, '우에시다리' (Uesidari), a representative team division game in Daejeon, was also created at this time and is believed to have been derived from the Japanese word '上(うえ, Ue)' meaning 'up' and the Japanese word '下(した, sita)' meaning 'down'.[16]\n\n\n\n![](image)Emblem of Taidenfu (Daejeonbu), the administrative division that existed during Japanese rule of Daejeon\nIn 1932, the capital of South Chungcheong Province was moved from Gongju to Daejeon. During the Korean War, the city was the site of an early major conflict: the Battle of Taejon. Also during the war, the mass graves of civilians killed by South Korean police were discovered near Taejon and reported on by Alan Winnington in his famous anti-war leaflet \"I Saw Truth in Korea\".[17][18] Embarrassed by the contents of the leaflet, the British government considered having him executed for treason, though instead decided to make him stateless.[19][20]\n\n\nSince then, changes have been made to the city's boundaries. Its official names have evolved, as well. Among the boundary modifications include one that effectively made the nearby town of Daedeok a part of the city in 1983. Then, in the late 1980s, Daejeon was elevated to the status of Special City (*Jikhalsi*), thus became a separate administrative region from South Chungcheong Province. In 1995, all South Korean Special Cities were again renamed as Metropolitan Cities, which is reflected in the current official name of Daejeon, Daejeon Metropolitan City (대전광역시).[12]\n\n\nIn the 1980s, the Korean administration began moving various national government operations from Seoul to Daejeon, eventually opening the Daejeon Government Complex in 1997. Today, the national government offices in Daejeon include Korea Customs Service, Small and Medium Business Administration, Public Procurement Service, National Statistical Office, Military Manpower Administration, Korea Forest Service, Cultural Heritage Administration, Korean Intellectual Property Office, Korail, Korea Water Resources Corporation, Korea Minting and Security Printing Corporation and Patent Court of Korea.\n\n\nThe population of Daejeon increased dramatically as a result of the government center.[21] However, with the construction of Sejong Special Self-Governing City in 2013 for the division of capital functions and balanced local development, many of the public institutions that had previously headed to Daejeon were moved to Sejong, and many public institutions in Seoul were also moved to Sejong. With the launch of Sejong City, large-scale development began, resulting in infrastructure construction and large-scale apartment complexes. Sejong is located immediately north of Daejeon, and Daejeon citizens began to outflow to Sejong. As of July 2020, there was net outflow of more than 100,000 people from Daejeon to Sejong.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Walking path along the Gap River\nDaejeon lies between latitudes N36°10'59\" and N36°30'1\" and longitudes E127°14'48\" and E127°33'35\" near the middle of South Korea. It is 167.3 km (104.0 mi) from Seoul, 294 km (183 mi) from Busan and 169 km (105 mi) from Gwangju.\n\n\nKnown historically as 'big field,' the city lies inside a great circle surrounded by several mountains, with Gyeryongsan National Park straddling the city border on the west, and the foot of the Sobaek Mountain range just beyond the city to the south and east. Three rivers run through the center of the city: Gapcheon (갑천), Yudeungcheon (유등천), and Daejeoncheon (대전천). These flow roughly from south to north, eventually joining the Geum River which borders the city on the northeast.

Travel time between Daejeon and Seoul using the KTX high-speed rail system is about 50 minutes. The nearest airport to Daejeon is Cheongju Airport, about a thirty-minute drive north of Daejeon. However, there are also direct bus connections to Incheon International Airport.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Subway[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Daejeon Metro\n\n![](image)Tashu, the public bicycle of Daejeon\nOne line, Daejeon Subway Line 1, of a planned five-line subway system has been operating since 17 April 2007 (partial operations on this line began on 16 March 2006). This subway line connects Daejeon Station, located in the original city center, with the more modern and more recently developed sections of this city, including Dunsan, where the city hall and a number of national government buildings are located.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nNotable differences between the Daejeon subway and the Seoul subway include narrower cars, no doors connecting cars, four cars per train rather than ten, and storage space under the seats for use by passengers.[59] Originally, plastic tokens for toll were read by a proximity sensor when entering the turnstiles, and then inserted into a slot when exiting. The design of the tokens allowed them to be used for advertising.[60] The system now employs the T-money system, a rechargeable series of Smart cards and other \"smart\" devices used for paying transportation fares. Platform screen doors are installed in the subway stations.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Cycling[edit]\n\n\nThe name of the public bicycle in Korea is different for each region, and the name of the public bicycle in Daejeon is **'타슈(Tashu)'[61]**. '타슈(Tashu) is a name created using the Chungcheong dialect, and if changed to standard Korean, it becomes '타세요(Taseyo)'. Tashu is an unmanned rental public bicycle service operated in Daejeon Metropolitan City since 2008, and the basic rental fee is 500 won, and if one purchases a daily ticket, the bicycle can be used unlimitedly within an hour on that day.

The city is home to 23 universities and colleges, including Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) and Chungnam National University, as well as government research institutes, and research and development centers for global companies such as Samsung, LG, mostly located in the city's Daedeok Science Town.[6][7]\n\n\nOccupied by humans since the Stone Age, Daejeon was historically a collection of small riverside villages.[8] Though the area had varying degrees of strategic importance depending on the period in history, it was largely undeveloped until its use as a rail hub from the early 1900s, during the period of Japanese occupation.[9] From the 1980s, multiple national administrative functions were moved from Seoul to Daejeon, most of which are now located in the Daejeon Government Complex, resulting in another population increase.[10] The city hosted the 1986 Asian Games, the Taejon Expo '93, the International Mathematical Olympiads in 2000, and was elevated to the status of Metropolitan City in 2005.[11][12]\n\n\nDaejeon is situated in a lowland valley with three major rivers, all of them eventually flowing into the Yellow Sea by way of the Geum river. The city is surrounded by several small mountains, and is located approximately 170 km (105.6 mi) south of Seoul and 290 km (180 mi) north of Busan, and 70 km (43 mi) east of the Yellow Sea.[13] Daejeon experiences a monsoon-influenced, four-season climate with wet, hot summers and drier, cold winters.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nHuman beings first settled in the Daejeon region during the Stone Age. It was occupied and in use as strategic military ground in various times by people such as the *Usul-gun* of Baekje, *Bipung-gun* of Silla, and the *Hoideok-hyeon*, *Yuseong-hyeon*, *Deokjin-hyeon*, and *Jinjam-hyeon*. During the Joseon Kingdom period, it remained occupied by the *Hoideok-hyeon* and *Jinjam-hyeon* of Gongju Mokha. In 1895, most of the area was made part of Hoideok-gun and Jinjam-gun, excluding some parts that belonged to Gongju-gun.\n\n\nThe Daejeon area was historically known as *Hanbat* (한밭),[14] a native Korean term for \"large field\", during the Joseon Dynasty. \"Daejeon\" simply means the same thing in Hanja. In the 19th century, Daejeon was also known in English as Kung-tsiou.[15]\n\n\nHistorically, Daejeon was a small village without many residents. However, in 1905, the Gyeongbu Railway began operations from Seoul to Busan, opening a station at Daejeon. In 1926 under the rule of the Japanese government, the Honam Railway was built between Mokpo and Daejeon, transforming the latter into a major transportation hub. Because of its location and proximity to means of transportation, Daejeon grew quickly.[9]\n\n\n\n![](image)Eunhaeng-Sunhwa neighborhood (Kasuga-Cho), c. 1920\nAs railroads were laid under Japanese rule, an environment friendly to the Japanese was created, and many Japanese began to settle in Daejeon taking advantage of the opportunity. According to 1910 census data, 58%, or more than half of the 4,350 Daejeon population at the time, were Japanese. In 1925, 56% of the 8,861 people in Daejeon were Japanese. Therefore, Daejeon was one of the cities with great cultural influence of Japanese residents. For example, elderly people who experienced Japanese colonial era pronounce '단무지' (Pickled radish, danmuji) as '닥광/단광'(dakgwang/dangwang), '컵' (cup, keob) as '고뿌' (goffu) and '비닐' (vinyl, binil) as '비니루' (binilu). In addition, '우에시다리' (Uesidari), a representative team division game in Daejeon, was also created at this time and is believed to have been derived from the Japanese word '上(うえ, Ue)' meaning 'up' and the Japanese word '下(した, sita)' meaning 'down'.[16]\n\n\n\n![](image)Emblem of Taidenfu (Daejeonbu), the administrative division that existed during Japanese rule of Daejeon\nIn 1932, the capital of South Chungcheong Province was moved from Gongju to Daejeon. During the Korean War, the city was the site of an early major conflict: the Battle of Taejon. Also during the war, the mass graves of civilians killed by South Korean police were discovered near Taejon and reported on by Alan Winnington in his famous anti-war leaflet \"I Saw Truth in Korea\".[17][18] Embarrassed by the contents of the leaflet, the British government considered having him executed for treason, though instead decided to make him stateless.[19][20]\n\n\nSince then, changes have been made to the city's boundaries. Its official names have evolved, as well. Among the boundary modifications include one that effectively made the nearby town of Daedeok a part of the city in 1983. Then, in the late 1980s, Daejeon was elevated to the status of Special City (*Jikhalsi*), thus became a separate administrative region from South Chungcheong Province. In 1995, all South Korean Special Cities were again renamed as Metropolitan Cities, which is reflected in the current official name of Daejeon, Daejeon Metropolitan City (대전광역시).[12]\n\n\nIn the 1980s, the Korean administration began moving various national government operations from Seoul to Daejeon, eventually opening the Daejeon Government Complex in 1997. Today, the national government offices in Daejeon include Korea Customs Service, Small and Medium Business Administration, Public Procurement Service, National Statistical Office, Military Manpower Administration, Korea Forest Service, Cultural Heritage Administration, Korean Intellectual Property Office, Korail, Korea Water Resources Corporation, Korea Minting and Security Printing Corporation and Patent Court of Korea.\n\n\nThe population of Daejeon increased dramatically as a result of the government center.[21] However, with the construction of Sejong Special Self-Governing City in 2013 for the division of capital functions and balanced local development, many of the public institutions that had previously headed to Daejeon were moved to Sejong, and many public institutions in Seoul were also moved to Sejong. With the launch of Sejong City, large-scale development began, resulting in infrastructure construction and large-scale apartment complexes. Sejong is located immediately north of Daejeon, and Daejeon citizens began to outflow to Sejong. As of July 2020, there was net outflow of more than 100,000 people from Daejeon to Sejong.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Walking path along the Gap River\nDaejeon lies between latitudes N36°10'59\" and N36°30'1\" and longitudes E127°14'48\" and E127°33'35\" near the middle of South Korea. It is 167.3 km (104.0 mi) from Seoul, 294 km (183 mi) from Busan and 169 km (105 mi) from Gwangju.\n\n\nKnown historically as 'big field,' the city lies inside a great circle surrounded by several mountains, with Gyeryongsan National Park straddling the city border on the west, and the foot of the Sobaek Mountain range just beyond the city to the south and east. Three rivers run through the center of the city: Gapcheon (갑천), Yudeungcheon (유등천), and Daejeoncheon (대전천). These flow roughly from south to north, eventually joining the Geum River which borders the city on the northeast. The river changes direction after leaving Daejeon, turning to the southwest and eventually emptying into the Yellow Sea near Gunsan.[22]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  Daejeon\n |\n| --- |\n| Climate chart (explanation) |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 26\n\n\n\n4\n\n−6\n | 37\n\n\n\n7\n\n−4\n | 52\n\n\n\n13\n\n1\n | 82\n\n\n\n19\n\n7\n | 92\n\n\n\n25\n\n13\n | 167\n\n\n\n28\n\n18\n | 307\n\n\n\n30\n\n22\n | 300\n\n\n\n30\n\n23\n | 153\n\n\n\n26\n\n17\n | 59\n\n\n\n21\n\n9\n | 48\n\n\n\n14\n\n3\n | 30\n\n\n\n6\n\n−3\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °C |\n| █ Precipitation totals in mm |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Imperial conversion |\n| --- |\n| J | F | M | A | M | J | J | A | S | O | N | D |\n| 1\n\n\n\n39\n\n22\n | 1.5\n\n\n\n45\n\n26\n | 2\n\n\n\n55\n\n34\n | 3.2\n\n\n\n67\n\n44\n | 3.6\n\n\n\n76\n\n55\n | 6.6\n\n\n\n82\n\n65\n | 12\n\n\n\n85\n\n72\n | 12\n\n\n\n87\n\n73\n | 6\n\n\n\n79\n\n63\n | 2.3\n\n\n\n69\n\n49\n | 1.9\n\n\n\n56\n\n37\n | 1.2\n\n\n\n43\n\n26\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °F |\n| █ Precipitation totals in inches |\n\n |\n\n\nDaejeon has a monsoon-influenced, four-season climate that lies between the humid subtropical and humid continental climatic classifications (Köppen *Cwa*/*Dwa*, respectively), with slightly more mild temperature extremes compared with Seoul.

The Daejeon World Cup Stadium was constructed for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, hosting several games including the South Korea vs. Italy match in the round of 16.[57] The facility is now the home of the city's football club. The Daejeon Hanbat Sports Complex was built in 1964, and was one of the host sites of the 1986 Asian Games, and also hosted preliminaries during the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul. Today, with several of the facilities renovated, it hosts the city's professional baseball, K3 League football, and volleyball teams.

Travel time between Daejeon and Seoul using the KTX high-speed rail system is about 50 minutes. The nearest airport to Daejeon is Cheongju Airport, about a thirty-minute drive north of Daejeon. However, there are also direct bus connections to Incheon International Airport.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Subway[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Daejeon Metro\n\n![](image)Tashu, the public bicycle of Daejeon\nOne line, Daejeon Subway Line 1, of a planned five-line subway system has been operating since 17 April 2007 (partial operations on this line began on 16 March 2006). This subway line connects Daejeon Station, located in the original city center, with the more modern and more recently developed sections of this city, including Dunsan, where the city hall and a number of national government buildings are located.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nNotable differences between the Daejeon subway and the Seoul subway include narrower cars, no doors connecting cars, four cars per train rather than ten, and storage space under the seats for use by passengers.[59] Originally, plastic tokens for toll were read by a proximity sensor when entering the turnstiles, and then inserted into a slot when exiting. The design of the tokens allowed them to be used for advertising.[60] The system now employs the T-money system, a rechargeable series of Smart cards and other \"smart\" devices used for paying transportation fares. Platform screen doors are installed in the subway stations.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Cycling[edit]\n\n\nThe name of the public bicycle in Korea is different for each region, and the name of the public bicycle in Daejeon is **'타슈(Tashu)'[61]**. '타슈(Tashu) is a name created using the Chungcheong dialect, and if changed to standard Korean, it becomes '타세요(Taseyo)'. Tashu is an unmanned rental public bicycle service operated in Daejeon Metropolitan City since 2008, and the basic rental fee is 500 won, and if one purchases a daily ticket, the bicycle can be used unlimitedly within an hour on that day. In other words, if you return it within an hour of rental, you can re-rent it for free immediately after returning it and use it for another hour. However, if it exceeds one hour, an extra fee will be automatically charged. The rental time is from 5 a.m. to 0 a.m., and rental is not possible from 0 a.m. to 5 a.m., and only return is possible. The name '타슈(Tashu)' is considered a good example of branding because it is a good name for anyone in the world to pronounce while maintaining their local identity.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![South Chuncheong Provincial Office in 1920s](image)\n\nSouth Chuncheong Provincial Office in 1920s\n* ![Government offices for the South Chungcheong province in 2007](image)\n\nGovernment offices for the South Chungcheong province in 2007\n* ![Daejeon Station in 1920s](image)\n\nDaejeon Station in 1920s\n* ![Daejeon train station in 2007](image)\n\nDaejeon train station in 2007\n* ![Daejeon O-World [ko]](image)\n\nDaejeon O-World [ko]\n* ![Uam Historic Park](image)\n\nUam Historic Park\n* ![Pyeongsong Youth Cultural Center and blocks of flats of Dunsan-dong district from Lotte City Hotel Daejeon in 2020](image)\n\nPyeongsong Youth Cultural Center and blocks of flats of Dunsan-dong district from Lotte City Hotel Daejeon in 2020\n* ![Mokcheok Bridge](image)\n\nMokcheok Bridge\n* ![Immigration office](image)\n\nImmigration office\n* ![View of Daejeon from Sikjang Mountain, with Dong-gu in the foreground](image)\n\nView of Daejeon from Sikjang Mountain, with Dong-gu in the foreground\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

The large volumes of port traffic and urban population in excess of 1 million make Busan a Large-Port metropolis using the Southampton System of Port-City classification.[7]\n\n\nBusan is divided into 15 major administrative districts and a single county, together housing a population of approximately 3.6 million. The full metropolitan area, the Southeastern Maritime Industrial Region, has a population of approximately 8 million.[8] The most densely built-up areas of the city are situated in a number of narrow valleys between the Nakdong and the Suyeong Rivers, with mountains separating most of the districts. The Nakdong River is Korea's longest river and Busan's Haeundae Beach is also the country's largest.\n\n\nBusan is a center for international conventions, hosting an APEC summit in 2005. It is also a center for sports tournaments in Korea, having hosted the 2002 Asian Games and FIFA World Cup. It is home to the world's largest department store, the Shinsegae Centum City.[9] Busan was added to the UNESCO Creative Cities Network as a \"City of Film\" in December 2014.[10]\n\n\n\n\n## Names[edit]\n\n\nThe name \"Busan\" is the Revised Romanization of the city's Korean name since the late 15th century.[11] It officially replaced the earlier McCune-Reischauer romanization *Pusan* in 2000.[12][b] During the Japanese occupation it was spelled \"Fuzan\".\n\n\nThe name 釜山 (now written 부산 using the Korean alphabet) is Sino-Korean for \"Cauldron Mountain\", believed to be a former name of Mt Hwangryeong (황령산, 荒嶺山, *Hwangryeong-san*) west of the city center. The area's ancient state Mt Geochil (거칠산국, 居柒山國, *Geochilsan-guk*, \"Rough-Mountain Land\") is similarly thought to refer to the same mountain, which towers over the town's harbor on the Suyeong. (The later Silla district of Geochilsan-gun was renamed Dongnae in 757.)[16]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

It was absorbed by Silla and organized as a district (*gun*). The grave goods excavated from mounded burials at Bokcheon-dong indicate that a complex chiefdom ruled by powerful individuals was present in the Busan area in the 4th century, just as Korea's Three Kingdoms were forming.[*citation needed*] The mounded burials of Bokcheon-dong were built along the top of a ridge that overlooks a wide area that makes up parts of modern-day Dongnae-gu and Yeonje-gu. Archaeologists excavated more than 250 iron weapons and ingots from Burial No. 38, a wooden chamber tomb at Bokcheon-dong. [*citation needed*]\n\n\nFrom the beginning of the 15th century, the Korean government designated Busan as a trading port with the Japanese and allowed their settlement. Other Japanese settlements in Ulsan and Jinhae diminished later, but the Busan settlement continued until Japan invaded Korea in 1592. After the war, diplomatic relations with the new shogunate in Japan were established in 1607, and Busan was permitted to be reconstructed. The Japanese settlement, *waegwan* (倭館), though relocated into Choryang (草梁) later, continued to exist until Korea was exposed to modern diplomacy in 1876. In 1876, Busan became the first international port in Korea under the terms of the Treaty of Ganghwa.\n\n\nDuring the Japanese rule, Busan developed into a hub trading port with Japan. Busan was the only city in Korea to adopt the steam tramway before electrification was introduced in 1924.[17]\n\n\nDuring the Korean War, Busan was one of only two cities in South Korea not captured by the North Korean army within the first three months of the war, the other being Daegu. As a result, the cities became refugee camp sites for Koreans during the war. According to the *Korea Times*, around 500,000 refugees were located in Busan in early 1951.[18]\n\n\nAs Busan was one of the few areas in Korea that remained under the control of South Korea throughout the Korean War, for some time it served as a *de facto* capital of the Republic of Korea.[*citation needed*] UN troops established a defensive perimeter around the city known as the Pusan Perimeter in the summer and fall of 1950. Since then, the city has been a self-governing metropolis and has built a strong urban character. \n\n\nIn 1963, Busan separated from Gyeongsangnam-do to become a Directly Governed City (직할시). In 1983, the provincial capital of Gyeongsangnam-do was moved from Busan to Changwon.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nBusan is located on the southeastern tip of the Korean Peninsula. It is located on the coast, which determined the development of the whole city itself. The distance from Busan to Seoul is about 314 km (195 mi). Busan borders low mountains on the north and west, and the seas on the south and east. The Nakdong River Delta is located on the west side of the city, and Geumjeongsan, the highest mountain in the city, is on the north. The Nakdong River, South Korea's longest river, flows through the west and empties into the Korea Strait. The southeastern region, called Yeongnam in Korea, encompasses both Gyeongsang Provinces and 3 metropolitan cities of Busan, Daegu and Ulsan. Ulsan lies northeast of Busan. The combined population exceeds 13 million.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe closest overseas area to Busan is Tsushima, Japan, with a distance of about 49.5 km (30.8 mi). The closest Japanese mainland area to Busan is Fukuoka, and the distance from Busan to Fukuoka is about 180 km (112 miles). Busan and Fukuoka are sister cities.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  Busan\n |\n| --- |\n| Climate chart (explanation) |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 35\n\n\n\n8\n\n0\n | 50\n\n\n\n10\n\n2\n | 90\n\n\n\n14\n\n5\n | 141\n\n\n\n18\n\n10\n | 156\n\n\n\n22\n\n15\n | 188\n\n\n\n25\n\n18\n | 327\n\n\n\n28\n\n22\n | 267\n\n\n\n30\n\n24\n | 161\n\n\n\n26\n\n20\n | 80\n\n\n\n23\n\n15\n | 50\n\n\n\n17\n\n8\n | 34\n\n\n\n10\n\n2\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °C |\n| █ Precipitation totals in mm |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Imperial conversion |\n| --- |\n| J | F | M | A | M | J | J | A | S | O | N | D |\n| 1.4\n\n\n\n47\n\n32\n | 2\n\n\n\n50\n\n35\n | 3.5\n\n\n\n57\n\n42\n | 5.5\n\n\n\n65\n\n50\n | 6.1\n\n\n\n72\n\n58\n | 7.4\n\n\n\n76\n\n65\n | 13\n\n\n\n82\n\n72\n | 10\n\n\n\n85\n\n75\n | 6.3\n\n\n\n80\n\n68\n | 3.1\n\n\n\n73\n\n58\n | 2\n\n\n\n62\n\n47\n | 1.3\n\n\n\n51\n\n36\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °F |\n| █ Precipitation totals in inches |\n\n |\n\n\nLocated on the southeasternmost tip of the Korean Peninsula, Busan has a cooler version of a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: *Cfa*, bordering on *Cwa*).[19] Extremely high or low temperatures are rare. The highest temperature ever recorded is 37.3 °C (99.1 °F) on 14 August 2016 while the lowest temperature ever recorded is −14.0 °C (6.8 °F) on 13 January 1915.[20] May to July, late Springs and early Summers, are usually cooler than inland regions because of the ocean effect. Late Summer, and early Fall, August, and September, are generally hot and humid and the city may experience typhoons at that time and be generally rainy. On September 15, 1959, Super Typhoon Sarah passed by the coast of the city and caused catastrophic damage. An unusually severe storm on September 12, 2003, Typhoon Maemi, also caused damage to ships and buildings and resulted in over 48 fatalities. Typhoon Hinnamnor on September 6, 2022, caused destruction in Busan as a category 2, producing high waves, destructive winds, and flooding. Busan is the most prone city in South Korea to typhoons and other natural disasters.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nOctober and November are generally the most comfortable, with clear skies and pleasant temperatures. Winters are cool and comparatively dry with high winds, but much milder than other parts of Korea, except Jeju-do and several islands off the southern coast. Busan and the nearby area have the least snow compared to other regions of Korea due to its location. Snow falls on an average of only about 4 days per year.[21]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Busan (1991–2020 normals, extremes 1904–present)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 18.4(65.1)\n | 20.3(68.5)\n | 22.9(73.2)\n | 28.1(82.6)\n | 34.0(93.2)\n | 33.4(92.1)\n | 35.8(96.4)\n | 37.3(99.1)\n | 35.2(95.4)\n | 30.8(87.4)\n | 25.6(78.1)\n | 20.9(69.6)\n | 37.3(99.1)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 8.2(46.8)\n | 10.2(50.4)\n | 13.8(56.8)\n | 18.2(64.8)\n | 22.0(71.6)\n | 24.6(76.3)\n | 27.5(81.5)\n | 29.5(85.1)\n | 26.4(79.5)\n | 22.5(72.5)\n | 16.6(61.9)\n | 10.4(50.7)\n | 19.2(66.6)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 3.6(38.5)\n | 5.4(41.7)\n | 9.1(48.4)\n | 13.8(56.8)\n | 17.9(64.2)\n | 21.0(69.8)\n | 24.4(75.9)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n | 22.6(72.7)\n | 17.9(64.2)\n | 11.9(53.4)\n | 5.8(42.4)\n | 15.0(59.0)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | −0.1(31.8)\n | 1.5(34.7)\n | 5.3(41.5)\n | 10.1(50.2)\n | 14.6(58.3)\n | 18.3(64.9)\n | 22.1(71.8)\n | 23.7(74.7)\n | 19.8(67.6)\n | 14.5(58.1)\n | 8.3(46.9)\n | 2.0(35.6)\n | 11.7(53.1)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −14.0(6.8)\n | −12.6(9.3)\n | −9.7(14.5)\n | −1.5(29.3)\n | 5.4(41.7)\n | 9.3(48.7)\n | 13.8(56.8)\n | 15.4(59.7)\n | 9.6(49.3)\n | 1.8(35.2)\n | −6.5(20.3)\n | −12.0(10.4)\n | −14.0(6.8)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 34.5(1.36)\n | 49.6(1.95)\n | 89.7(3.53)\n | 140.9(5.55)\n | 155.9(6.14)\n | 188.4(7.42)\n | 326.8(12.87)\n | 266.5(10.49)\n | 160.6(6.32)\n | 79.6(3.13)\n | 50.4(1.98)\n | 33.8(1.33)\n | 1,576.7(62.07)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.1 mm) | 5.4\n | 5.9\n | 8.3\n | 9.2\n | 9.1\n | 10.4\n | 13.6\n | 11.9\n | 9.2\n | 5.3\n | 6.0\n | 4.7\n | 99.0\n |\n| Average snowy days\n | 1.4\n | 1.2\n | 0.5\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.1\n | 0.9\n | 4.1\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 46.8\n | 49.4\n | 56.0\n | 61.1\n | 68.3\n | 76.8\n | 83.4\n | 78.5\n | 72.6\n | 62.7\n | 56.3\n | 48.1\n | 63.3\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 203.1\n | 189.4\n | 202.0\n | 212.6\n | 228.5\n | 180.3\n | 172.3\n | 199.2\n | 173.8\n | 212.1\n | 195.5\n | 205.6\n | 2,374.4\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 63.6\n | 59.3\n | 52.0\n | 53.6\n | 51.1\n | 41.4\n | 37.5\n | 48.2\n | 44.9\n | 59.6\n | 62.6\n | 67.0\n | 52.3\n |\n| Average ultraviolet index | 2\n | 4\n | 6\n | 7\n | 9\n | 10\n | 10\n | 10\n | 8\n | 5\n | 3\n | 2\n | 6\n |\n| Source 1: Korea Meteorological Administration (percent sunshine 1981–2010)[21][20][22] |\n| Source 2: Weather Atlas (UV)[23] |\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nIn 1957, Busan adopted a division system with the creation of six *gu* (districts): Busanjin-gu, Dong-gu, Dongnae-gu, Jung-gu, Seo-gu, and Yeongdo-gu.

The port's container terminal has 43 berths - 20 berths at the North Port, and 23 berths at the Busan New Port (including 2 multi-purpose berths). The port is part of the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road that runs from the Chinese coast to Singapore, towards the southern tip of India to Mombasa, from there through the Red Sea via the Suez Canal to the Mediterranean, there to the Upper Adriatic region to the northern Italian hub of Trieste with its connections to Central Europe and the North Sea.[27][28][29][30]\n\n\nMoreover, the city is a center of marine science and R&D, and home to a number of relevant institutions, such as the Korea Maritime Institute (KMI), the Korea Institute of Ocean Science and Technology (KIOST), the National Fishery Products Quality Management Service, the Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency (KHOA), and the Korea National Maritime Museum, located in Dongsam Innovation Complex in Yeongdo-gu district. Moreover, the International Federation of Freight Forwarders Associations (FIATA) World Congress is scheduled to be hosted in Busan in 2020.[*citation needed*] (Busan New Port)\n\n\nThe city is also known for its global MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Exhibitions) industry. The city's convention and exhibition zone have excellent conditions and infrastructure to host large-scale international events, which includes BEXCO in Centum City, Nurimaru APEC House, and hotels nearby natural environments. Major international conferences in Busan include the 2005 APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting, ASEAN–Republic of Korea Commemorative Summit 2014, and 2018 African Development Bank Group Annual Meetings. (BEXCO)\n\n\nBusan is also a center of finance. Korea Exchange (KRX), Korea's sole securities exchange operator, is headquartered in Busan.

There are also four substantial shopping areas of note: Seomyeon, Gwangbok-dong, Busan Daehak-ga in Jangjeon-dong, and Centum City in Haeundae-gu.\n\n\nSeomyeon Station is one of the busiest subway stations in Korea; it is the transfer station between Busan Subway Line 1 and Line 2. Seomyeon subway station is also home to a large number of underground stores, selling a variety of products, predominantly clothing, and footwear. These are small stores selling locally produced products. The local head offices of Korean and international banks are located in Seomyeon. It is recognized as the ascendant shopping and entertainment district. It is also home to \"Seomyeon Medical Street\", the district encompassing the 1 km-radius range around Lotte Department Store in Seomyeon and the Buam subway station. The Street is home to a total of 160 cosmetic and other medical clinics, including those specializing in cosmetic surgery, dermatology, ophthalmology and dentistry.[31][32] Directly adjacent to Seomyeon is Bujeon Market, the largest traditional market in the city.\n\n\nThe Gwangbok-dong, Nampo-dong, and Jungang-dong areas form the old central business district. Some of the restaurants in this district use family recipes passed down through the generations. Jagalchi Market, a large seafood market, is located in this area. The Gukje Market is also nearby. Jungang-dong is the home of many international law offices, the old Immigration Office, and the international ferry terminal serving Japanese routes. Lotte World II is currently under construction along the water between Jungang-dong 7-Ga and 8-Ga.[33]\n\n\nCentum City, an industrial complex, contains luxury department stores. Busan has many major department stores, including Lotte Department Store (located in Seomyeon, Centum City, Gwangbok-dong and Dongnae), Lotte Premium Outlet (in Gimhae and Gijang), Shinsegae Premium Outlet (in Gijang), as well as large supermarket chains across the city, such as Homeplus, e-mart, and Costco.\n\n\nBusan's major hotels include The Westin Chosun Busan, Paradise Busan, and Park Hyatt Busan.

The area around Pukyong National University and Kyungsung University also has many cafés, bars, and restaurants attracting college students and youth.\n\n\nBusan is called the summer capital of Korea[*citation needed*] since it attracts tourists from all over the country to its six beaches. Luxury hotels and a carnival boardwalk line the beach at Haeundae. Gwangalli Beach has cafés, bars, and restaurants along the beach, and the Grand Gwangan Bridge. Other beaches include Dadaepo Beach on the west edge of the city and Songdo Beach, which is south-central.\n\n\nHaeundae Beach is one of the most famous beaches in Korea.[*citation needed*] The 2009 film *Tidal Wave* (2009) is about a tsunami hitting Busan at this beach.\n\n\nGeumjeongsan to the west is a weekend hiking spot for Busan residents. To the north, the neighborhoods around Pusan National University (also known as PNU, which is one of the most highly recognized national institutes of higher education in Korea) have student theaters, cafés, bars, and restaurants, as well as open-air cultural street performances on weekend nights. Nearby is Beomeosa, the city's main Korean Buddhist temple.\n\n\nYongdusan Park occupies 69,000 square meters/17 acres (7 ha) and is home to the Busan Tower, Yongdusan Art Gallery, and the Busan Aquarium, the largest aquarium in South Korea. The park supports approximately seventy different species of trees and is a tourist destination, with various cultural events throughout the year.[39]\n\n\nDongnae-gu is a wealthy and traditional residential area. Dongnae Oncheon is a natural spa area with many baths, tourist hotels, restaurants, clubs, and shopping areas. Many restaurants in the area use family recipes. Chungnyeolsa is a Confucian shrine for soldiers who died during the 16th-century battle against the Japanese at Dongnae Fortress.[40]\n\n\nTaejongdae is a natural park with cliffs facing the open sea on the island of Yeongdo.\n\n\nThe area known as the \"Foreigners' Shopping Street\", but commonly referred to as \"Texas Street\" near part of the Port of Busan, and adjacent to the front entrance to the Busan Train Station (부산역) has many businesses that cater to the local Russian population, as well as the crews of foreign ships. The area was originally the location of the local Chinatown and still contains a Chinese school.\n\n\nHaedong Yonggung temple is one of three sacred places related to the Goddess Buddha. It is located right near the sea. It lies on a mountain in the front and the sea at the back.\n\n\nGamcheon Cultural Village was created in the 1950s as a residential community along a mountain slope. The houses in the village are built in a staircase fashion. The village often dubbed the \"Machu Picchu of Korea\" attracts many tourists. In addition, the village received a special mention during the 3rd edition of the international award ceremony, \"UCLG-MEXICO CITY-Culture 21\".\n\n\n\n![](image)Nurimaru APEC HouseBusan Citizens Park (formerly Camp Hialeah) is a former Imperial Japanese Army base and United States Army camp located in the Busanjin District.\n\n\nDongbaek Island is located at the southern end of Haeundae Beach. The island creates a picturesque scene in harmony with a thick forest of camellias and pine trees. Tourist attractions on Dongbaek Island include a walking path and the Nurimaru APEC House, built for the 2005 APEC summit.\n\n\n\nHuinnyeoul Culture Village was created when Korean War refugees flocked to this area. It provides an unhindered view of both the Busanhang and Namhang Ports. A major backdrop of the 2013 film *The Attorney*, the neighborhood was also featured in the 2012 film *Nameless Gangster: Rules of the Time*. The small houses that stand shoulder to shoulder form the signature look of Busan, which is often remembered as a city of the sea and hilly neighborhoods. The village continues to attract an increasing number of visitors with its new cafes, workshops, and guesthouses.\n\n![](image)Daejeo Ecological Park\nMillak Waterfront Park is the first waterfront park in Korea, which combines the oceanfront with public leisure facilities. The park is located between Haeundae Beach and Gwangalli Beach. The waterfront park, with an area of 33,507m², can accommodate as many as 40,000 visitors. The floor of the park is decorated with colorful blocks, and the park provides visitors a perfect chance to relax and features flower gardens, gazebos, and benches. If you sit on the 3,040–wide stand, you can dip your feet in the water during high tide.\n\n\nWith a length of 7.62 km (4.73 mi) and a size of 2.66 km2 (1.03 sq mi), designated as Natural Monument No. 179, Daejeo Ecological Park is a habitat for migratory birds at the Nakdong River Estuary. The estuary was chosen as a trial project for the Four Major Rivers Restoration Project. The sports facilities were partially built on the upper and lower parts of the park only, while the rest of the park underwent a restoration of its wetlands and natural grassland. In the garden inside the park, you can find a large-scale habitat for prickly water lilies, which are part of the Endangered Species Level II classification. Many interesting festivals, such as the Nakdong Riverside Cherry Blossom Festival, the Busan Nakdong River Canola Flower Festival, and the Daejeo Tomato Festival are held around this park every year.\n\n\nIlgwang Beach is a long white-sand beach, extending for about 1.8 kilometers, and is particularly popular among families with young children as a vacation spot because the waters are quite shallow. Every summer, the Gaetmaeul Outdoor Drama Festival is held on this beach. The festival features diverse performances of traditional Korean music, outdoor dramas, mime shows, and other performance art forms.\n\n\nKiswire Museum offers its visitors a chance to better understand wire, a key material for industrial development, and central to Kiswire's corporate philosophy. The museum won the 2014 Busan Architecture Award for its aesthetic design.[*citation needed*] In addition, the roof of the museum is supported by only 38 cables without any pillars or beams, which makes the museum quite unique. In addition, the museum features special art pieces, including artwork made with wires.\n\n\nJeonpo Café Street in Seomyeon, Busan is one of the busiest areas, with a variety of entertainment, restaurants, and stores. Across Seomyeon 1 Beonga (Seomyeon 1st Street), the busiest street in the area, there is a quiet and tranquil street with about 30 unique cafés. Several years ago, the Bujeon-dong and Jeonpo-dong areas were full of hardware stores and machine part suppliers.[*citation needed*] However, since 2010 the area has been transformed into a street full of cafés.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nBusan is planning to build the first floating city in the world. So-called Oceanix City will be finished and ready for settlement by 2025.[41]\n\n\n\n### Temples, religious and historical sites[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Buddhist temples in Busan\n\n![](image)Beomeosa Temple\n![](image)Haedong Yonggungsa Temple\n* Beomeosa Temple\n* Busanjinjiseong Fortress (or Jaseongdae)\n* Cheonseongjinseong Fortress\n* Chungnyeolsa Shrine\n* Dongnaeeupseong Fortress\n* Dongnae Hyanggyo Confucian shrine-school\n* Dongnaebu Dongheon\n* Dongsam-dong Shell Mound\n* Fortress site of Jwasuyeong\n* Geumjeongsanseong Fortress\n* Haedong Yonggung Temple\n* Janggwancheong\n* Gungwancheong\n* Songgongdan Altar\n* Jeongongdan Altar\n* Samgwangsa Temple\n* Tumuli in Bokcheon-dong, Dongnae\n* United Nations Memorial Cemetery[42]\n* Waeseong in Jukseong-ri, Gijang\n* Yeongdo Bridge\n* Yeonggadae Pavilion\n* Yungongdan Altar\n\n\n### Arts[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Busan Exhibition and Convention Center\nBusan hosts the Busan International Film Festival (BIFF)—one of the most popular international film festivals in Asia—at the Busan Cinema Center every fall. It is also the home of the Busan Biennale, an international contemporary art biennale that takes place every two years.\n\n\nThe city also hosts the One Asia Festival, the largest K-pop festival in Korea beginning in 2016, positioning itself as the center of K-pop culture.[43]\n\n\nIn 2012, German artist Hendrik Beikirch painted Asia's tallest mural entitled \"Fisherman Portrait\" on a building near Millak Raw Fish Town.[44]\n\n\nBusan is home to 80 performance facilities consisting of 30 public ones, including the Busan Cultural Center, Busan Citizens'Hall, Busan Cinema Center, and Busan National Gugak Center. There are 40 private facilities, such as KBS Art Hall Busan, Sohyang Art Center, MBC Samjoo Art Hall, Kyungsung University Concert Hall, and Shinsegae Department Store Culture Hall.\n\n\n\n### Festivals[edit]\n\n\nBusan is the city of festivals and film. A variety of festivals are held in the city throughout the year. Following the Joseon Tongsinsa Festival (Registration of Documents on Joseon Tongsinsa on the UNESCO Memory of the World Programme in 2017) and Busan Port Festival in May, the Busan Sea Festival at Haeundae Beach, the largest beach in Korea, and the Busan International Rock Festival takes place in August. In particular, October is the perfect month to enjoy a variety of festivals, such as the Busan International Film Festival, the largest film festival in Asia, the Busan Fireworks Festival, and the One Asia Festival, a global K-pop music festival. In addition, G-Star, the largest gaming exhibition in Korea, and the e-Sports World Championship are hosted in November, followed by the Busan Christmas Tree Festival in December (Busan Fireworks Festival).\n\n\n**Major Public performance facilities**\n\n\n\n\n\n| No.\n | Facility\n | Number of Seats\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | Busan Cultural Center\n | 2,389\n |\n| 2\n | Busan Citizens' Hall\n | 1,941\n |\n| 3\n | BEXCO Auditorium\n | 2,644\n |\n| 4\n | Busan National Gugak Center\n | 974\n |\n| 5\n | Busan Cinema Center Haneulyeon Theatre\n | 841\n |\n| 6\n | Korea National Maritime Museum\n | 311\n |\n\n\n### Museums[edit]\n\n\nMuseums in Busan include:\n\n\n\n* Busan Museum\n* Busan Museum of Art\n* Museum of Contemporary Art Busan[45]\n* Busan Museum of Movies[46]\n* Busan Modern History Museum\n* Busan Marine Natural History Museum\n* Korea National Maritime Museum\n* Bokcheon Museum\n* Kiswire Museum[47]\n* Provisional Capital Memorial Hall\n* Trickeye Museum\n* United Nations Peace Memorial Hall\n* 40-step Stairway Culture Center\n* Dongnae Eupseong History Museum\n\n\n### Traditional cuisine[edit]\n\n\n![A plate of a colorful pancake made with green scallions, sliced red chili pepper and chopped seafood](image)*Dongnae pajeon*\nBusan was once a center of military affairs in the southern region of the peninsula and therefore was an important site for diplomatic relationships with Japan; high-ranking officers and officials from the court frequently visited the city. Special foods were prepared for the officers such as *Dongnae pajeon* (동래파전), a variant of *pajeon* (Korean savory pancakes), made with whole scallions, sliced chili peppers, and various kinds of seafood in a thick batter of wheat flour, glutinous rice flour, eggs, salt and water.[48]\n\n\nDuring the Korean War, Busan was the biggest refugee destination on the peninsula; people from all regions of Korea went there. Some of these refugees stayed and adapted and adjusted the recipes of their local specialties. One of these foods is *milmyeon* (밀면) (lit. 'wheat noodle') a version of *naengmyeon*, cold buckwheat noodle soup, but using wheat flour instead. (Naengmyeon is originally a specialty food of Hamhung and Pyongyang, now part of North Korea.[49][50]) *Dwaeji gukbap* (돼지국밥) (lit. 'pork/pig soup rice') is also a result of Korean War. It is a hearty pork soup and is becoming more popular nationwide.[51] Pork trotters served with vegetables such as cucumbers, onions, and mustard sauce is popular and is called Nangchae-Jokbal.[52]\n\n\n\n### Hot spring resorts and spas[edit]\n\n\nBusan has the largest hot spring resorts and facilities in Korea. Busan's Oncheon is the oldest hot spring spa in Korea. It even has its unique history, where long ago an old man with aching legs was said to have seen an injured crane come to the hot spring and bath in it.

The large volumes of port traffic and urban population in excess of 1 million make Busan a Large-Port metropolis using the Southampton System of Port-City classification.[7]\n\n\nBusan is divided into 15 major administrative districts and a single county, together housing a population of approximately 3.6 million. The full metropolitan area, the Southeastern Maritime Industrial Region, has a population of approximately 8 million.[8] The most densely built-up areas of the city are situated in a number of narrow valleys between the Nakdong and the Suyeong Rivers, with mountains separating most of the districts. The Nakdong River is Korea's longest river and Busan's Haeundae Beach is also the country's largest.\n\n\nBusan is a center for international conventions, hosting an APEC summit in 2005. It is also a center for sports tournaments in Korea, having hosted the 2002 Asian Games and FIFA World Cup. It is home to the world's largest department store, the Shinsegae Centum City.[9] Busan was added to the UNESCO Creative Cities Network as a \"City of Film\" in December 2014.[10]\n\n\n\n\n## Names[edit]\n\n\nThe name \"Busan\" is the Revised Romanization of the city's Korean name since the late 15th century.[11] It officially replaced the earlier McCune-Reischauer romanization *Pusan* in 2000.[12][b] During the Japanese occupation it was spelled \"Fuzan\".\n\n\nThe name 釜山 (now written 부산 using the Korean alphabet) is Sino-Korean for \"Cauldron Mountain\", believed to be a former name of Mt Hwangryeong (황령산, 荒嶺山, *Hwangryeong-san*) west of the city center. The area's ancient state Mt Geochil (거칠산국, 居柒山國, *Geochilsan-guk*, \"Rough-Mountain Land\") is similarly thought to refer to the same mountain, which towers over the town's harbor on the Suyeong. (The later Silla district of Geochilsan-gun was renamed Dongnae in 757.)[16]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

It was absorbed by Silla and organized as a district (*gun*). The grave goods excavated from mounded burials at Bokcheon-dong indicate that a complex chiefdom ruled by powerful individuals was present in the Busan area in the 4th century, just as Korea's Three Kingdoms were forming.[*citation needed*] The mounded burials of Bokcheon-dong were built along the top of a ridge that overlooks a wide area that makes up parts of modern-day Dongnae-gu and Yeonje-gu. Archaeologists excavated more than 250 iron weapons and ingots from Burial No. 38, a wooden chamber tomb at Bokcheon-dong. [*citation needed*]\n\n\nFrom the beginning of the 15th century, the Korean government designated Busan as a trading port with the Japanese and allowed their settlement. Other Japanese settlements in Ulsan and Jinhae diminished later, but the Busan settlement continued until Japan invaded Korea in 1592. After the war, diplomatic relations with the new shogunate in Japan were established in 1607, and Busan was permitted to be reconstructed. The Japanese settlement, *waegwan* (倭館), though relocated into Choryang (草梁) later, continued to exist until Korea was exposed to modern diplomacy in 1876. In 1876, Busan became the first international port in Korea under the terms of the Treaty of Ganghwa.\n\n\nDuring the Japanese rule, Busan developed into a hub trading port with Japan. Busan was the only city in Korea to adopt the steam tramway before electrification was introduced in 1924.[17]\n\n\nDuring the Korean War, Busan was one of only two cities in South Korea not captured by the North Korean army within the first three months of the war, the other being Daegu. As a result, the cities became refugee camp sites for Koreans during the war. According to the *Korea Times*, around 500,000 refugees were located in Busan in early 1951.[18]\n\n\nAs Busan was one of the few areas in Korea that remained under the control of South Korea throughout the Korean War, for some time it served as a *de facto* capital of the Republic of Korea.[*citation needed*] UN troops established a defensive perimeter around the city known as the Pusan Perimeter in the summer and fall of 1950. Since then, the city has been a self-governing metropolis and has built a strong urban character. \n\n\nIn 1963, Busan separated from Gyeongsangnam-do to become a Directly Governed City (직할시). In 1983, the provincial capital of Gyeongsangnam-do was moved from Busan to Changwon.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nBusan is located on the southeastern tip of the Korean Peninsula. It is located on the coast, which determined the development of the whole city itself. The distance from Busan to Seoul is about 314 km (195 mi). Busan borders low mountains on the north and west, and the seas on the south and east. The Nakdong River Delta is located on the west side of the city, and Geumjeongsan, the highest mountain in the city, is on the north. The Nakdong River, South Korea's longest river, flows through the west and empties into the Korea Strait. The southeastern region, called Yeongnam in Korea, encompasses both Gyeongsang Provinces and 3 metropolitan cities of Busan, Daegu and Ulsan. Ulsan lies northeast of Busan. The combined population exceeds 13 million.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe closest overseas area to Busan is Tsushima, Japan, with a distance of about 49.5 km (30.8 mi). The closest Japanese mainland area to Busan is Fukuoka, and the distance from Busan to Fukuoka is about 180 km (112 miles). Busan and Fukuoka are sister cities.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  Busan\n |\n| --- |\n| Climate chart (explanation) |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 35\n\n\n\n8\n\n0\n | 50\n\n\n\n10\n\n2\n | 90\n\n\n\n14\n\n5\n | 141\n\n\n\n18\n\n10\n | 156\n\n\n\n22\n\n15\n | 188\n\n\n\n25\n\n18\n | 327\n\n\n\n28\n\n22\n | 267\n\n\n\n30\n\n24\n | 161\n\n\n\n26\n\n20\n | 80\n\n\n\n23\n\n15\n | 50\n\n\n\n17\n\n8\n | 34\n\n\n\n10\n\n2\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °C |\n| █ Precipitation totals in mm |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Imperial conversion |\n| --- |\n| J | F | M | A | M | J | J | A | S | O | N | D |\n| 1.4\n\n\n\n47\n\n32\n | 2\n\n\n\n50\n\n35\n | 3.5\n\n\n\n57\n\n42\n | 5.5\n\n\n\n65\n\n50\n | 6.1\n\n\n\n72\n\n58\n | 7.4\n\n\n\n76\n\n65\n | 13\n\n\n\n82\n\n72\n | 10\n\n\n\n85\n\n75\n | 6.3\n\n\n\n80\n\n68\n | 3.1\n\n\n\n73\n\n58\n | 2\n\n\n\n62\n\n47\n | 1.3\n\n\n\n51\n\n36\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °F |\n| █ Precipitation totals in inches |\n\n |\n\n\nLocated on the southeasternmost tip of the Korean Peninsula, Busan has a cooler version of a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: *Cfa*, bordering on *Cwa*).[19] Extremely high or low temperatures are rare. The highest temperature ever recorded is 37.3 °C (99.1 °F) on 14 August 2016 while the lowest temperature ever recorded is −14.0 °C (6.8 °F) on 13 January 1915.[20] May to July, late Springs and early Summers, are usually cooler than inland regions because of the ocean effect. Late Summer, and early Fall, August, and September, are generally hot and humid and the city may experience typhoons at that time and be generally rainy. On September 15, 1959, Super Typhoon Sarah passed by the coast of the city and caused catastrophic damage. An unusually severe storm on September 12, 2003, Typhoon Maemi, also caused damage to ships and buildings and resulted in over 48 fatalities. Typhoon Hinnamnor on September 6, 2022, caused destruction in Busan as a category 2, producing high waves, destructive winds, and flooding. Busan is the most prone city in South Korea to typhoons and other natural disasters.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nOctober and November are generally the most comfortable, with clear skies and pleasant temperatures. Winters are cool and comparatively dry with high winds, but much milder than other parts of Korea, except Jeju-do and several islands off the southern coast. Busan and the nearby area have the least snow compared to other regions of Korea due to its location. Snow falls on an average of only about 4 days per year.[21]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Busan (1991–2020 normals, extremes 1904–present)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 18.4(65.1)\n | 20.3(68.5)\n | 22.9(73.2)\n | 28.1(82.6)\n | 34.0(93.2)\n | 33.4(92.1)\n | 35.8(96.4)\n | 37.3(99.1)\n | 35.2(95.4)\n | 30.8(87.4)\n | 25.6(78.1)\n | 20.9(69.6)\n | 37.3(99.1)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 8.2(46.8)\n | 10.2(50.4)\n | 13.8(56.8)\n | 18.2(64.8)\n | 22.0(71.6)\n | 24.6(76.3)\n | 27.5(81.5)\n | 29.5(85.1)\n | 26.4(79.5)\n | 22.5(72.5)\n | 16.6(61.9)\n | 10.4(50.7)\n | 19.2(66.6)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 3.6(38.5)\n | 5.4(41.7)\n | 9.1(48.4)\n | 13.8(56.8)\n | 17.9(64.2)\n | 21.0(69.8)\n | 24.4(75.9)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n | 22.6(72.7)\n | 17.9(64.2)\n | 11.9(53.4)\n | 5.8(42.4)\n | 15.0(59.0)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | −0.1(31.8)\n | 1.5(34.7)\n | 5.3(41.5)\n | 10.1(50.2)\n | 14.6(58.3)\n | 18.3(64.9)\n | 22.1(71.8)\n | 23.7(74.7)\n | 19.8(67.6)\n | 14.5(58.1)\n | 8.3(46.9)\n | 2.0(35.6)\n | 11.7(53.1)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −14.0(6.8)\n | −12.6(9.3)\n | −9.7(14.5)\n | −1.5(29.3)\n | 5.4(41.7)\n | 9.3(48.7)\n | 13.8(56.8)\n | 15.4(59.7)\n | 9.6(49.3)\n | 1.8(35.2)\n | −6.5(20.3)\n | −12.0(10.4)\n | −14.0(6.8)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 34.5(1.36)\n | 49.6(1.95)\n | 89.7(3.53)\n | 140.9(5.55)\n | 155.9(6.14)\n | 188.4(7.42)\n | 326.8(12.87)\n | 266.5(10.49)\n | 160.6(6.32)\n | 79.6(3.13)\n | 50.4(1.98)\n | 33.8(1.33)\n | 1,576.7(62.07)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.1 mm) | 5.4\n | 5.9\n | 8.3\n | 9.2\n | 9.1\n | 10.4\n | 13.6\n | 11.9\n | 9.2\n | 5.3\n | 6.0\n | 4.7\n | 99.0\n |\n| Average snowy days\n | 1.4\n | 1.2\n | 0.5\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.1\n | 0.9\n | 4.1\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 46.8\n | 49.4\n | 56.0\n | 61.1\n | 68.3\n | 76.8\n | 83.4\n | 78.5\n | 72.6\n | 62.7\n | 56.3\n | 48.1\n | 63.3\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 203.1\n | 189.4\n | 202.0\n | 212.6\n | 228.5\n | 180.3\n | 172.3\n | 199.2\n | 173.8\n | 212.1\n | 195.5\n | 205.6\n | 2,374.4\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 63.6\n | 59.3\n | 52.0\n | 53.6\n | 51.1\n | 41.4\n | 37.5\n | 48.2\n | 44.9\n | 59.6\n | 62.6\n | 67.0\n | 52.3\n |\n| Average ultraviolet index | 2\n | 4\n | 6\n | 7\n | 9\n | 10\n | 10\n | 10\n | 8\n | 5\n | 3\n | 2\n | 6\n |\n| Source 1: Korea Meteorological Administration (percent sunshine 1981–2010)[21][20][22] |\n| Source 2: Weather Atlas (UV)[23] |\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nIn 1957, Busan adopted a division system with the creation of six *gu* (districts): Busanjin-gu, Dong-gu, Dongnae-gu, Jung-gu, Seo-gu, and Yeongdo-gu.

The port's container terminal has 43 berths - 20 berths at the North Port, and 23 berths at the Busan New Port (including 2 multi-purpose berths). The port is part of the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road that runs from the Chinese coast to Singapore, towards the southern tip of India to Mombasa, from there through the Red Sea via the Suez Canal to the Mediterranean, there to the Upper Adriatic region to the northern Italian hub of Trieste with its connections to Central Europe and the North Sea.[27][28][29][30]\n\n\nMoreover, the city is a center of marine science and R&D, and home to a number of relevant institutions, such as the Korea Maritime Institute (KMI), the Korea Institute of Ocean Science and Technology (KIOST), the National Fishery Products Quality Management Service, the Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency (KHOA), and the Korea National Maritime Museum, located in Dongsam Innovation Complex in Yeongdo-gu district. Moreover, the International Federation of Freight Forwarders Associations (FIATA) World Congress is scheduled to be hosted in Busan in 2020.[*citation needed*] (Busan New Port)\n\n\nThe city is also known for its global MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Exhibitions) industry. The city's convention and exhibition zone have excellent conditions and infrastructure to host large-scale international events, which includes BEXCO in Centum City, Nurimaru APEC House, and hotels nearby natural environments. Major international conferences in Busan include the 2005 APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting, ASEAN–Republic of Korea Commemorative Summit 2014, and 2018 African Development Bank Group Annual Meetings.

There are also four substantial shopping areas of note: Seomyeon, Gwangbok-dong, Busan Daehak-ga in Jangjeon-dong, and Centum City in Haeundae-gu.\n\n\nSeomyeon Station is one of the busiest subway stations in Korea; it is the transfer station between Busan Subway Line 1 and Line 2. Seomyeon subway station is also home to a large number of underground stores, selling a variety of products, predominantly clothing, and footwear. These are small stores selling locally produced products. The local head offices of Korean and international banks are located in Seomyeon. It is recognized as the ascendant shopping and entertainment district. It is also home to \"Seomyeon Medical Street\", the district encompassing the 1 km-radius range around Lotte Department Store in Seomyeon and the Buam subway station. The Street is home to a total of 160 cosmetic and other medical clinics, including those specializing in cosmetic surgery, dermatology, ophthalmology and dentistry.[31][32] Directly adjacent to Seomyeon is Bujeon Market, the largest traditional market in the city.\n\n\nThe Gwangbok-dong, Nampo-dong, and Jungang-dong areas form the old central business district. Some of the restaurants in this district use family recipes passed down through the generations. Jagalchi Market, a large seafood market, is located in this area. The Gukje Market is also nearby. Jungang-dong is the home of many international law offices, the old Immigration Office, and the international ferry terminal serving Japanese routes. Lotte World II is currently under construction along the water between Jungang-dong 7-Ga and 8-Ga.[33]\n\n\nCentum City, an industrial complex, contains luxury department stores. Busan has many major department stores, including Lotte Department Store (located in Seomyeon, Centum City, Gwangbok-dong and Dongnae), Lotte Premium Outlet (in Gimhae and Gijang), Shinsegae Premium Outlet (in Gijang), as well as large supermarket chains across the city, such as Homeplus, e-mart, and Costco.\n\n\nBusan's major hotels include The Westin Chosun Busan, Paradise Busan, and Park Hyatt Busan.

The area around Pukyong National University and Kyungsung University also has many cafés, bars, and restaurants attracting college students and youth.\n\n\nBusan is called the summer capital of Korea[*citation needed*] since it attracts tourists from all over the country to its six beaches. Luxury hotels and a carnival boardwalk line the beach at Haeundae. Gwangalli Beach has cafés, bars, and restaurants along the beach, and the Grand Gwangan Bridge. Other beaches include Dadaepo Beach on the west edge of the city and Songdo Beach, which is south-central.\n\n\nHaeundae Beach is one of the most famous beaches in Korea.[*citation needed*] The 2009 film *Tidal Wave* (2009) is about a tsunami hitting Busan at this beach.\n\n\nGeumjeongsan to the west is a weekend hiking spot for Busan residents. To the north, the neighborhoods around Pusan National University (also known as PNU, which is one of the most highly recognized national institutes of higher education in Korea) have student theaters, cafés, bars, and restaurants, as well as open-air cultural street performances on weekend nights. Nearby is Beomeosa, the city's main Korean Buddhist temple.\n\n\nYongdusan Park occupies 69,000 square meters/17 acres (7 ha) and is home to the Busan Tower, Yongdusan Art Gallery, and the Busan Aquarium, the largest aquarium in South Korea. The park supports approximately seventy different species of trees and is a tourist destination, with various cultural events throughout the year.[39]\n\n\nDongnae-gu is a wealthy and traditional residential area. Dongnae Oncheon is a natural spa area with many baths, tourist hotels, restaurants, clubs, and shopping areas. Many restaurants in the area use family recipes. Chungnyeolsa is a Confucian shrine for soldiers who died during the 16th-century battle against the Japanese at Dongnae Fortress.[40]\n\n\nTaejongdae is a natural park with cliffs facing the open sea on the island of Yeongdo.\n\n\nThe area known as the \"Foreigners' Shopping Street\", but commonly referred to as \"Texas Street\" near part of the Port of Busan, and adjacent to the front entrance to the Busan Train Station (부산역) has many businesses that cater to the local Russian population, as well as the crews of foreign ships. The area was originally the location of the local Chinatown and still contains a Chinese school.\n\n\nHaedong Yonggung temple is one of three sacred places related to the Goddess Buddha. It is located right near the sea. It lies on a mountain in the front and the sea at the back.\n\n\nGamcheon Cultural Village was created in the 1950s as a residential community along a mountain slope. The houses in the village are built in a staircase fashion. The village often dubbed the \"Machu Picchu of Korea\" attracts many tourists. In addition, the village received a special mention during the 3rd edition of the international award ceremony, \"UCLG-MEXICO CITY-Culture 21\".\n\n\n\n![](image)Nurimaru APEC HouseBusan Citizens Park (formerly Camp Hialeah) is a former Imperial Japanese Army base and United States Army camp located in the Busanjin District.\n\n\nDongbaek Island is located at the southern end of Haeundae Beach. The island creates a picturesque scene in harmony with a thick forest of camellias and pine trees. Tourist attractions on Dongbaek Island include a walking path and the Nurimaru APEC House, built for the 2005 APEC summit.\n\n\n\nHuinnyeoul Culture Village was created when Korean War refugees flocked to this area. It provides an unhindered view of both the Busanhang and Namhang Ports. A major backdrop of the 2013 film *The Attorney*, the neighborhood was also featured in the 2012 film *Nameless Gangster: Rules of the Time*. The small houses that stand shoulder to shoulder form the signature look of Busan, which is often remembered as a city of the sea and hilly neighborhoods. The village continues to attract an increasing number of visitors with its new cafes, workshops, and guesthouses.\n\n![](image)Daejeo Ecological Park\nMillak Waterfront Park is the first waterfront park in Korea, which combines the oceanfront with public leisure facilities. The park is located between Haeundae Beach and Gwangalli Beach. The waterfront park, with an area of 33,507m², can accommodate as many as 40,000 visitors. The floor of the park is decorated with colorful blocks, and the park provides visitors a perfect chance to relax and features flower gardens, gazebos, and benches. If you sit on the 3,040–wide stand, you can dip your feet in the water during high tide.\n\n\nWith a length of 7.62 km (4.73 mi) and a size of 2.66 km2 (1.03 sq mi), designated as Natural Monument No. 179, Daejeo Ecological Park is a habitat for migratory birds at the Nakdong River Estuary. The estuary was chosen as a trial project for the Four Major Rivers Restoration Project. The sports facilities were partially built on the upper and lower parts of the park only, while the rest of the park underwent a restoration of its wetlands and natural grassland. In the garden inside the park, you can find a large-scale habitat for prickly water lilies, which are part of the Endangered Species Level II classification. Many interesting festivals, such as the Nakdong Riverside Cherry Blossom Festival, the Busan Nakdong River Canola Flower Festival, and the Daejeo Tomato Festival are held around this park every year.\n\n\nIlgwang Beach is a long white-sand beach, extending for about 1.8 kilometers, and is particularly popular among families with young children as a vacation spot because the waters are quite shallow. Every summer, the Gaetmaeul Outdoor Drama Festival is held on this beach. The festival features diverse performances of traditional Korean music, outdoor dramas, mime shows, and other performance art forms.\n\n\nKiswire Museum offers its visitors a chance to better understand wire, a key material for industrial development, and central to Kiswire's corporate philosophy. The museum won the 2014 Busan Architecture Award for its aesthetic design.[*citation needed*] In addition, the roof of the museum is supported by only 38 cables without any pillars or beams, which makes the museum quite unique. In addition, the museum features special art pieces, including artwork made with wires.\n\n\nJeonpo Café Street in Seomyeon, Busan is one of the busiest areas, with a variety of entertainment, restaurants, and stores.

Special foods were prepared for the officers such as *Dongnae pajeon* (동래파전), a variant of *pajeon* (Korean savory pancakes), made with whole scallions, sliced chili peppers, and various kinds of seafood in a thick batter of wheat flour, glutinous rice flour, eggs, salt and water.[48]\n\n\nDuring the Korean War, Busan was the biggest refugee destination on the peninsula; people from all regions of Korea went there. Some of these refugees stayed and adapted and adjusted the recipes of their local specialties. One of these foods is *milmyeon* (밀면) (lit. 'wheat noodle') a version of *naengmyeon*, cold buckwheat noodle soup, but using wheat flour instead. (Naengmyeon is originally a specialty food of Hamhung and Pyongyang, now part of North Korea.[49][50]) *Dwaeji gukbap* (돼지국밥) (lit. 'pork/pig soup rice') is also a result of Korean War. It is a hearty pork soup and is becoming more popular nationwide.[51] Pork trotters served with vegetables such as cucumbers, onions, and mustard sauce is popular and is called Nangchae-Jokbal.[52]\n\n\n\n### Hot spring resorts and spas[edit]\n\n\nBusan has the largest hot spring resorts and facilities in Korea. Busan's Oncheon is the oldest hot spring spa in Korea. It even has its unique history, where long ago an old man with aching legs was said to have seen an injured crane come to the hot spring and bath in it. After bathing in its waters, the crane became completely cured and happily flew away. Upon seeing this, the old man also bathed his aching legs in the water and was cured. Among the hot spas, 'Dongnae Oncheon' and 'Haeundae Oncheon' are the most famous ones. Today, the spas have an outdoor bath and sauna.\n\n\n\n* Spa Land (Haeundae-Gu)\n* HurShimChung Hot Spring Resorts and Spa Town (Dongnae-Gu)\n* Haeundae Hot Spring Resorts and Spa Towns (Haeundae-Gu)\n* Dongnae Hot Spring Resorts and Spa Towns (Dongnae-Gu)\n* Gwangalli Spa Towns (Suyeong-Gu)\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Station or Newspaper\n | Types\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Busan KBS\n | TV, Radio\n |\n| Busan MBC\n | TV, Radio\n |\n| KNN | TV, Radio\n |\n| Busan CBS\n | Radio\n |\n| Busan BBS\n | Radio\n |\n| Busan eFM\n | Radio (English, Chinese)\n |\n| Busan PBC\n | Radio\n |\n| Busan Ilbo\n | Daily Newspaper\n |\n| Kookje Shinmun\n | Daily Newspaper\n |\n\n\n### In popular culture[edit]\n\n\nAlthough Seoul remains the de facto film and television capital of South Korea, Busan shares more in common with Cannes, France than just its reputation as seaside resort town.[53]\n\n\nThe Busan International Film Festival is often referred to as the \"Cannes of Asia\", attracting thousands of entertainment personalities from both Eastern and Western cinema every year, honoring and recognizing international luminaries such as Mike Leigh, Shōhei Imamura, Wong Kar-wai, and Kim Ki-duk.[54][55]\n\n\nIt is frequently used as a film location, best known in the west for Marvel's *Black Panther* and Apple's *Pachinko*, but also for the Korean market productions of *Train to Busan*, *Old Boy*, and *Decision to Leave*, as well as the popular K-Drama *Reply 1997*, highlighting the distinct \nGyeongsang dialect, which is comparable to a Scottish English in relation to standard British English.[56][57]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Busan population pyramid in 2022\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% p.a. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1995 | 3,745,784 | —     |\n| 2000 | 3,587,562 | −0.86% |\n| 2005 | 3,439,916 | −0.84% |\n| 2015 | 3,448,737 | +0.03% |\n| 2020 | 3,349,016 | −0.59% |\n| source:[58] |\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nReligion in Busan (2015)[59]\n\n\n\nNot religious (53.2%)\nBuddhism (28.5%)\nProtestantism (12.1%)\nCatholicism (5.4%)\nOther (0.8%)\n\nAccording to the census of 2015, 28.5% followed Buddhism and 17.5% followed Christianity (12.1% Protestantism and 5.4% Catholicism). 53.2% of the population is irreligious.[59]\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\nThe city planned to bid for the 2020 Summer Olympics, but withdrew after the 2018 Winter Olympics were awarded to Pyeongchang, also located in South Korea.

It is a designated metropolitan city under the direct control of the central government's Home Minister. The city was also the capital of South Jeolla Province until the provincial office moved to the southern village of Namak in Muan County in 2005 because Gwangju was promoted to a metropolitan city and was independent of South Jeolla province.\n\n\nIts name is composed of the words *Gwang* (Korean: 광; Hanja: 光) meaning \"light\" and *Ju* (주; 州) meaning \"province\". Gwangju was historically recorded as *Muju* (무주; 武州), in which \"Silla merged all of the land to establish the provinces of Gwangju, Ungju, Jeonju, Muju and various counties, plus the southern boundary of Goguryeo and the ancient territories of Silla\" in the *Samguk Sagi.*[3] In the heart of the agricultural Jeolla region, the city is also famous for its rich and diverse cuisine.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A memorial to commemorate the lives lost in the 1980 Gwangju uprising.\nThe city was established in 57 BC. It was one of the administrative centers of Baekje during the Three Kingdoms Period.[4]\n\n\nIn 1929, during the period of Imperial Japanese rule, a confrontation between Korean and Japanese students in the city turned into Gwangju Student Independence Movement, a regional demonstration, which culminated in one of the major nationwide uprisings against Imperial Japanese cruelty during the colonial period.\n\n\nThe modern industry was established in Gwangju with the construction of a railway to Seoul. Some of the industries that took hold include cotton textiles, rice mills and breweries. Construction of a designated industrial zone in 1967 encouraged growth in industry, especially in the sectors linked to the automobile industry.\n\n\nIn May 1980, peaceful demonstrations took place in Gwangju against Chun Doo-hwan, leader of the military coup d'état of 12 December 1979. The demonstrations were suppressed by military forces, including elite units of the Special Operations Command. The situation escalated after a violent crackdown, resulting in the Gwangju Uprising, where civilians raided armories and armed themselves. By the time the uprising was suppressed 9 days later, many hundreds of civilians and several police forces / soldiers were dead. After civilian rule was reinstated in 1987, a national cemetery was established to honor the victims of the incident.[5]\n\n\nIn 1986, Gwangju separated from Jeollanam-do to become a Directly Governed City (Jikhalsi), and then became a Metropolitan City (Gwangyeoksi) in 1995.[4]\n\n\nDue to a variety of factors, including the ancient rivalry between Baekje and Silla, as well as the biased priority given to the Gyeongsang region by political leaders in the 2nd half of the 20th century, Gwangju has a long history of voting for left-leaning politicians and is the main stronghold for the liberal Democratic Party of Korea along with its predecessors, as well as the progressive Justice Party.\n\n\nGwangju held many sports events such as 2002 FIFA World Cup, 2015 Summer Universiade, 2019 World Aquatics Championships.\n\n\n\n## Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of districts of Gwangju\n\nGwangju is divided into 5 districts (\"Gu\").\n\n\n\n\n\n| Map\n | Name\n | Korean | Hanja |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n |\n| Districts\n |\n| Buk District | 북구 | 北區 |\n| Dong District | 동구 | 東區 |\n| Gwangsan District | 광산구 | 光山區 |\n| Nam District | 남구 | 南區 |\n| Seo District | 서구 | 西區 |\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nReligion in Gwangju (2015)[6]\n\n\n\nNot religious (61%)\nProtestantism (20%)\nBuddhism (9.5%)\nCatholicism (8.7%)\nOther (0.8%)\n\nAccording to the census of 2015, 9.5% of the population followed Buddhism and 28.7% followed Christianity (20% Protestantism and 8.7% Catholicism) 61% of the population are irreligious.[6]\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\nThe population model of Gwangju is as follows;[7]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year | Population\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1960 |   409,283\n |\n| 1966 |   532,235\n |\n| 1970 |   622,755\n |\n| 1975 |   737,283\n |\n| 1980 |   856,545\n |\n| 1985 | 1,042,508\n |\n| 1990 | 1,139,003\n |\n| 1995 | 1,257,636\n |\n| 2000 | 1,352,797\n |\n| 2005 | 1,417,716\n |\n| 2010 | 1,475,745\n |\n| 2016 | 1,500,621\n |\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\nGwangju has a cooler version of the humid subtropical climate (Köppen: *Cfa/Cwa*) with four distinct seasons and rainfall year-round but particularly during the East Asian Monsoon Season in the summer months.\n\n\nWinters, while still somewhat cold, are milder than in Seoul and cities further north due to the city's southwesterly position in the Korean peninsula. \nSummers are hot and humid with abundant precipitation, particularly in the form of thunderstorms.

It is a designated metropolitan city under the direct control of the central government's Home Minister. The city was also the capital of South Jeolla Province until the provincial office moved to the southern village of Namak in Muan County in 2005 because Gwangju was promoted to a metropolitan city and was independent of South Jeolla province.\n\n\nIts name is composed of the words *Gwang* (Korean: 광; Hanja: 光) meaning \"light\" and *Ju* (주; 州) meaning \"province\". Gwangju was historically recorded as *Muju* (무주; 武州), in which \"Silla merged all of the land to establish the provinces of Gwangju, Ungju, Jeonju, Muju and various counties, plus the southern boundary of Goguryeo and the ancient territories of Silla\" in the *Samguk Sagi.*[3] In the heart of the agricultural Jeolla region, the city is also famous for its rich and diverse cuisine.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A memorial to commemorate the lives lost in the 1980 Gwangju uprising.\nThe city was established in 57 BC. It was one of the administrative centers of Baekje during the Three Kingdoms Period.[4]\n\n\nIn 1929, during the period of Imperial Japanese rule, a confrontation between Korean and Japanese students in the city turned into Gwangju Student Independence Movement, a regional demonstration, which culminated in one of the major nationwide uprisings against Imperial Japanese cruelty during the colonial period.\n\n\nThe modern industry was established in Gwangju with the construction of a railway to Seoul. Some of the industries that took hold include cotton textiles, rice mills and breweries. Construction of a designated industrial zone in 1967 encouraged growth in industry, especially in the sectors linked to the automobile industry.\n\n\nIn May 1980, peaceful demonstrations took place in Gwangju against Chun Doo-hwan, leader of the military coup d'état of 12 December 1979. The demonstrations were suppressed by military forces, including elite units of the Special Operations Command. The situation escalated after a violent crackdown, resulting in the Gwangju Uprising, where civilians raided armories and armed themselves. By the time the uprising was suppressed 9 days later, many hundreds of civilians and several police forces / soldiers were dead. After civilian rule was reinstated in 1987, a national cemetery was established to honor the victims of the incident.[5]\n\n\nIn 1986, Gwangju separated from Jeollanam-do to become a Directly Governed City (Jikhalsi), and then became a Metropolitan City (Gwangyeoksi) in 1995.[4]\n\n\nDue to a variety of factors, including the ancient rivalry between Baekje and Silla, as well as the biased priority given to the Gyeongsang region by political leaders in the 2nd half of the 20th century, Gwangju has a long history of voting for left-leaning politicians and is the main stronghold for the liberal Democratic Party of Korea along with its predecessors, as well as the progressive Justice Party.\n\n\nGwangju held many sports events such as 2002 FIFA World Cup, 2015 Summer Universiade, 2019 World Aquatics Championships.\n\n\n\n## Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of districts of Gwangju\n\nGwangju is divided into 5 districts (\"Gu\").\n\n\n\n\n\n| Map\n | Name\n | Korean | Hanja |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n |\n| Districts\n |\n| Buk District | 북구 | 北區 |\n| Dong District | 동구 | 東區 |\n| Gwangsan District | 광산구 | 光山區 |\n| Nam District | 남구 | 南區 |\n| Seo District | 서구 | 西區 |\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nReligion in Gwangju (2015)[6]\n\n\n\nNot religious (61%)\nProtestantism (20%)\nBuddhism (9.5%)\nCatholicism (8.7%)\nOther (0.8%)\n\nAccording to the census of 2015, 9.5% of the population followed Buddhism and 28.7% followed Christianity (20% Protestantism and 8.7% Catholicism) 61% of the population are irreligious.[6]\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\nThe population model of Gwangju is as follows;[7]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year | Population\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1960 |   409,283\n |\n| 1966 |   532,235\n |\n| 1970 |   622,755\n |\n| 1975 |   737,283\n |\n| 1980 |   856,545\n |\n| 1985 | 1,042,508\n |\n| 1990 | 1,139,003\n |\n| 1995 | 1,257,636\n |\n| 2000 | 1,352,797\n |\n| 2005 | 1,417,716\n |\n| 2010 | 1,475,745\n |\n| 2016 | 1,500,621\n |\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\nGwangju has a cooler version of the humid subtropical climate (Köppen: *Cfa/Cwa*) with four distinct seasons and rainfall year-round but particularly during the East Asian Monsoon Season in the summer months.\n\n\nWinters, while still somewhat cold, are milder than in Seoul and cities further north due to the city's southwesterly position in the Korean peninsula. \nSummers are hot and humid with abundant precipitation, particularly in the form of thunderstorms. Gwangju is one of the warmest cities in Korea in the summer due to its geographic location.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Gwangju (1991–2020 normals, extremes 1939–present)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 18.8(65.8)\n | 22.6(72.7)\n | 26.8(80.2)\n | 30.4(86.7)\n | 33.9(93.0)\n | 36.7(98.1)\n | 38.5(101.3)\n | 38.5(101.3)\n | 34.5(94.1)\n | 31.1(88.0)\n | 27.1(80.8)\n | 19.8(67.6)\n | 38.5(101.3)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 5.7(42.3)\n | 8.3(46.9)\n | 13.6(56.5)\n | 19.9(67.8)\n | 24.8(76.6)\n | 27.9(82.2)\n | 30.0(86.0)\n | 30.9(87.6)\n | 27.1(80.8)\n | 21.9(71.4)\n | 15.0(59.0)\n | 8.0(46.4)\n | 19.4(66.9)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 1.0(33.8)\n | 2.9(37.2)\n | 7.5(45.5)\n | 13.4(56.1)\n | 18.7(65.7)\n | 22.7(72.9)\n | 25.9(78.6)\n | 26.5(79.7)\n | 22.2(72.0)\n | 16.1(61.0)\n | 9.6(49.3)\n | 3.2(37.8)\n | 14.1(57.4)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | −2.7(27.1)\n | −1.5(29.3)\n | 2.4(36.3)\n | 7.8(46.0)\n | 13.4(56.1)\n | 18.7(65.7)\n | 22.8(73.0)\n | 23.2(73.8)\n | 18.2(64.8)\n | 11.2(52.2)\n | 5.0(41.0)\n | −0.8(30.6)\n | 9.8(49.6)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −19.4(−2.9)\n | −17.7(0.1)\n | −10.7(12.7)\n | −4.5(23.9)\n | 1.4(34.5)\n | 7.2(45.0)\n | 14.9(58.8)\n | 12.6(54.7)\n | 5.6(42.1)\n | −2.7(27.1)\n | −7.2(19.0)\n | −13.7(7.3)\n | −19.4(−2.9)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 32.6(1.28)\n | 43.6(1.72)\n | 61.9(2.44)\n | 86.6(3.41)\n | 91.4(3.60)\n | 152.6(6.01)\n | 294.2(11.58)\n | 326.4(12.85)\n | 145.0(5.71)\n | 59.0(2.32)\n | 50.2(1.98)\n | 37.1(1.46)\n | 1,380.6(54.35)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.1 mm) | 10.1\n | 8.2\n | 8.8\n | 8.9\n | 9.0\n | 10.2\n | 15.1\n | 15.0\n | 9.6\n | 6.8\n | 8.8\n | 10.2\n | 120.7\n |\n| Average snowy days\n | 9.9\n | 6.3\n | 2.4\n | 0.3\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 1.1\n | 8.4\n | 28.4\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 65.7\n | 61.6\n | 60.3\n | 60.2\n | 64.5\n | 72.0\n | 79.8\n | 78.0\n | 73.6\n | 67.6\n | 66.9\n | 66.9\n | 68.1\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 161.4\n | 170.5\n | 201.0\n | 214.1\n | 227.9\n | 169.9\n | 143.1\n | 169.0\n | 174.4\n | 208.5\n | 167.4\n | 156.9\n | 2,164.1\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 51.1\n | 53.4\n | 51.8\n | 54.3\n | 51.3\n | 39.0\n | 32.9\n | 41.4\n | 46.3\n | 58.5\n | 52.7\n | 51.1\n | 48.0\n |\n| Average ultraviolet index | 2\n | 2\n | 3\n | 4\n | 5\n | 5\n | 7\n | 6\n | 5\n | 3\n | 3\n | 2\n | 4\n |\n| Source 1: Korea Meteorological Administration (percent sunshine 1981–2010)[8][9][10] |\n| Source 2: Weather Atlas (UV)[11] |\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nChonnam National University, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, and Gwangju Education University are public universities in Gwangju.\n\n\nHonam University, Gwangju University, Gwangshin University, Gwangju Women's University, Nambu University, Chosun University, and Honam Christian University are private universities.\n\n\nGwangju Health University is a private community college offering associate degrees in humanities and social sciences, healthcare sciences, and a bachelor's degree in nursing.\n\n\nGwangju has 593 schools, consisting of 234 kindergartens, 145 elementary schools, 84 middle schools, 65 high schools, 1 science high school,[12] 7 junior colleges, 9 universities, 38 graduate schools, and 11 others (as of 1 May 2009) with a total of 406,669 students, or 28.5% of the total city population.

Daegu and surrounding North Gyeongsang Province are often referred to as Daegu-Gyeongbuk, with a total population over 5 million.\n\n\nDaegu is located in south-eastern Korea about 80 km (50 mi) from the seacoast, near the Geumho River and its mainstream, Nakdong River in Gyeongsang-do. The Daegu basin is the central plain of the Yeongnam region. In ancient times, the Daegu area was part of the proto-kingdom Jinhan. Subsequently, Daegu came under the control of the Silla Kingdom, which unified the Korean Peninsula. During the Joseon Dynasty period, the city was the capital of Gyeongsang-do, one of the traditional eight provinces of the country.\n\n\nDaegu was an economic motor of Korea during the 1960s–1980s period and was especially known for its electronics industry. The humid subtropical climate of Daegu is ideal for producing high-quality apples, thus the nickname, \"Apple City\".[4] Daegu is also known as \"Textile City\".[5] Textiles used to be the pillar industry of the city. With the establishment of the Daegu-Gyeongbuk Free Economic Zone, Daegu is currently focusing on fostering fashion and high-tech industries.\n\n\nDaegu was the host city of the 22nd World Energy Congress, the 2011 World Championships in Athletics and the 2003 Summer Universiade.[6] It also hosted four matches in the 2002 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Daegu\n\n### Prehistory and early history[edit]\n\n\nArchaeological investigations in the Greater Daegu area have revealed a large number of settlements and burials of the prehistoric Mumun Pottery Period (around 1500–300 BC). In fact, some of the earliest evidence of Mumun settlement in Gyeongsangdo have been excavated from Siji-dong and Seobyeon-dong.[7] Dongcheon-dong is one of the substantial Mumun agricultural villages that have been excavated.[8] The Dongcheon-dong site dates back to the Middle Mumun (around 850–550 BC) and contains the remains of many prehistoric pit-houses and agricultural fields. Megalithic burials (dolmens) have also been found in large numbers in Daegu.\n\n\nAncient historical texts indicate that during the Proto–Three Kingdoms (Mahan, Jinhan, and Byeonhan) period, Daegu was the site of a chiefdom or walled-town polity known from that time, according to historical records, as Dalgubeol. It was absorbed into the kingdom of Silla no later than the fifth century. The vestiges of the wall can be seen, and relics have been excavated in the current Dalseong Park.\n\n\n\n![](image)Reliquary from eighth-century Silla, Daegu National Museum\n### Silla[edit]\n\n\nSilla succeeded in unifying the Korean peninsula by defeating the other kingdoms of Baekje and Goguryeo in the late seventh century, partly due to assistance from China's Tang Dynasty. Shortly thereafter, in 689, Silla's King Sinmun considered moving the capital from Gyeongju to Daegu, but was unable to do so.[9] This initiative is known only through a single line in the *Samguk Sagi*, a most valued historical record of ancient Korea by Koryeo Dynasty historian Kim Bu-sik, but it is presumed to indicate both an attempt by the Silla king to reinforce royal authority and the entrenched resistance of the Gyeongju political elites that was the likely cause of the move's failure.[10] The city was given its current name in 757.\n\n\nIn the late 1990s, archaeologists excavated a large-scale fortified Silla site in Dongcheon-dong, Buk-gu.[11] The site at Locality 2 consists of the remains of 39 raised-floor buildings enclosed by a formidable ditch-and-palisade system. The excavators hypothesize that the fortified site was a permanent military encampment or barracks. Archaeologists also uncovered a large Silla village dating to the sixth to seventh centuries AD at Siji-dong.[7]\n\n\n\n### Later Three Kingdoms and Goryeo[edit]\n\n\nDuring the Later Three Kingdoms period, 892–936, Daegu was initially aligned with Hubaekje. In 927, northern Daegu was the site of the Battle of Gong Mountain between the forces of Goryeo under Wang Geon and those of Hubaekje under Gyeon Hwon. In this battle, the forces of Goryeo were crushed and Wang Geon himself was saved only by the heroic deed of his general Shin Sung-gyeom. However, the atrocities of the Hubaekje forces at this time apparently changed local sympathizers to favor Wang Geon, who later became the king of Goryeo.\n\n\nNumerous place names and local legends in the area still bear witness to the historic battle of 927. Among these are \"Ansim\", which literally means \"peace of mind\", said to be the first place where Wang Geon dared to stop after escaping the battle, and \"Banwol\", or half-moon, where he is said to have stopped and admired the moon before returning to Goryeo. A statue commemorating the battle now stands in northern Daegu, as does a memorial to Sin Sunggyeom.\n\n\nIn the Goryeo period, the first edition of the *Tripitaka Koreana* was stored in Daegu, at the temple of Buinsa.[12] However, this edition was destroyed when the temple was sacked in 1254, during the Mongol invasions of Korea.[13]\n\n\n\n### Joseon[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Daegu in the 18th century\nDaegu served as an important transportation center during the Joseon Dynasty, being located in the middle of the Great Yeongnam Road which ran between Seoul and Busan, at the junction of this arterial road and the roads to Gyeongju and Jinju.\n\n\nIn 1601, Daegu became the administrative capital of the Gyeongsang-do, which is current Daegu, Busan, Ulsan, Gyeongsangbuk-do, and Gyeongsangnam-do. At about that time, the city began to grow into a major city. The status continued for nearly 300 years, and the city has been transformed as the capital of Gyeongsangbuk-do since Gyeongsang-do was divided into two provinces, Gyeongsangbuk-do (northern Gyeongsang-province) and Gyeongsangnam-do (southern one) in 1896.\n\n\nDaegu's first regular markets were established during the late Joseon period. The most famous of these is the Yangnyeongsi herbal medicine market. This became a center of herbal trade in Joseon, and even attracted buyers from neighboring countries. Traders from Japan, who were not permitted to leave the Nakdong River valley, hired messengers to visit the market on their behalf. Seomun Market, which stood at the city's west gate at that time, was one of the top-three markets in the Joseon period.\n\n\n\n### Korean Empire and colonial rule[edit]\n\n\nJapanese imperialism forcibly opened up Korea's markets beginning in the late 19th century. In 1895, Daegu became the site of one of the country's first modern post offices, as a part of the 'Gab-o' reforms introduced in the aftermath of the First Sino-Japanese war.[14]\n\n\nBeginning in the late 1890s, increasing numbers of foreign merchants and workers started to visit Daegu, which emerged as a modern transportation center of the newly constructed Gyeongbu Line main railroad connecting Seoul and Busan.\n\n\nIn 1905, the old fortress wall was forcibly destroyed. As a tribute to the wall, streets that now run where the wall once stood have been named Bukseongno, Namseongno, Dongseongno and Seoseongno, which translates as \"north fortress street\", \"south fortress street\", \"east fortress street\" and \"west fortress street\" respectively.\n\n\n\n![](image)\n{| style=\"width:.5ex;margin:2px;padding:1px;border:1px solid #000000;\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n|大 ·邱\n|\n\n\n\n|} Emblem of Taikyu-fu (Daegu Prefecture), when Daegu was under Japanese rule\n![](image)\nDaegu Metropolitan City Characters\n\nIndependence movements against imperial aggressions were outstanding in Daegu. These began as early as 1898, when a branch of the Independence Club was opened in the town.[15] As the demise of the Korean Empire approached in 1907, local citizens led by Seo Sang-don organized the National Debt Repayment Movement. The movement spread nationwide, although it fell short of repaying the national debt through individual donations. Freedom fighting continued after the 1910 annexation, notably during the March 1st movement of 1919. At that time, four major demonstrations took place in Daegu, involving an estimated 23,000 peace-loving citizens.[16]\n\n\n\n### After 1945[edit]\n\n\nIn 1946, the Daegu October Incident took place, one of the most serious social disorders since the foundation of the Republic of Korea.[17] On October 1, Korean national police killed three student demonstrators and injured many others.[18] It was also the site of major demonstrations on February 28, 1960, prior to the presidential election of that year.[19]\n\n\nDaegu and all of North Gyeongsang province had heavy guerrilla activities in the late 1940s, as thousands of refugees shied away from the fighting in Jeolla province and sought shelters in Daegu.[20] In November 1948, a unit in Daegu joined the mutiny which had begun in Yeosu the previous month.[21] As in many other areas during the Korean War, political killings of dissenters were widespread.\n\n\nDuring the Korean War, heavy fighting occurred nearby along the Nakdong River. Daegu sat inside the Pusan Perimeter, however, so it remained in South Korean hands throughout the war. The fighting that prevented North Korean troops from crossing the Nakdong River has become known as the Battle of Taegu.\n\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, the city underwent explosive growth, and the population has increased more than tenfold since the end of the Korean War. The city was politically favored during the 18-year-long rule of Park Chung Hee, when it and the surrounding area served as his political base. Daegu champions conservative political ideas and movements today and is a political base for the Saenuri Party.\n\n\nIn the 1980s, Daegu separated from Gyeongsangbuk-do and became a separately administered provincial-level directly governed city (*Jikhalsi*), and was redesignated as a metropolitan city (*Gwangyeoksi*) in 1995. Today, Daegu is the third-largest metropolitan area in Korea with respect to both population and commerce.\n\n\nSince 1990, Daegu has suffered two of South Korea's worst mass casualty disasters: the 1995 Daegu gas explosions, which killed 101 people, and the 2003 Daegu subway fire, which killed 192 people.\n\n\nIn February 2020, Daegu was the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea.[22]\n\n\nIn July 2023, the Gunwi County of the North Gyeongsang Province integrated into Daegu.\n\n\n\n## Politics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Daegu City Hall\nTwo local governments are in the city, the Daegu Metropolitan Government in Jung District and Gyeongbuk Provincial Government in Buk District. The provincial government will be relocated to Andong in its proper province, Gyeongbuk. As a result, the provincial government office was relocated to Andong in January 2023. The mayor and heads of city's eight districts are directly elected by the citizens every four years. The city council has 29 members which consist of 26 from the same number of electoral districts and three proportional representations. They are also directly elected every four years. Most of them are the members of the Liberty Korea Party, the main conservative political party in South Korea. Daegu is a stronghold for the party and has produced four Presidents of the Republic of Korea thus far: Park Chung Hee, Chun Doo-hwan, Roh Tae-woo and Park Geun-hye. Park Chung Hee and Chun Doo-hwan were born in other cities but they moved to Daegu and spent childhood in Daegu. As the capital of the Korean conservatives, the city has wielded strong political influence in elections.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Administrative divisions\nMain article: List of districts and county of Daegu\n\nDaegu is divided into 7 districts (*Gu*) and 2 counties (*Gun*)\n\n\n\n* Jung District (중구, 中區) – *means the central district.*\n* Dong District (동구, 東區) – *means the east district.*\n* Seo District (서구, 西區) – *means the west district.*\n* Nam District (남구, 南區) – *means the south district.*\n* Buk District (북구, 北區) – *means the north district.*\n* Suseong District (수성구, 壽城區)\n* Dalseo District (달서구, 達西區)\n* Dalseong County (달성군, 達城郡)\n* Gunwi County (군위군, 軍威郡)\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n### Topography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)View of both the city of Daegu, with Jisan-dong and Beommul-dong\nDaegu sits in a basin surrounded by low mountains.

In Holdridge climate classification, Daegu has a warm temperate moist forest climate. The mountains that comprise the basin trap hot and humid air. Similarly, in winter, cold air lies in the basin. The area receives little precipitation except during the rainy season of summer and is sunny throughout much of the year. Data gathered since 1961 indicates that the mean temperature for January, the coldest month in Daegu, is 0.6 °C (33 °F) and that for August, the warmest month, is 26.4 °C (80 °F). The city's lowest record temperature was −20.2 °C (−4 °F),[23] and the city's highest record temperature was 40.0 °C (104 °F).[24] In 2014, high temperatures led to the emergence of a new term called Daefrica (대프리카, Daegu+Africa) starting with the internet community, and has been used in the media, broadcasting, etc.[25] In 2015, a traffic cone in Daegu melted in the heat.[26] Summers in Daegu are some of the hottest in the Korean peninsula.[27][28] In 2023, on July 31[29] and August 3,[30][31] median strips could not overcome the heat and melted in different parts of the same district in Daegu.\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Daegu (1991–2020 normals, extremes 1907–present)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 16.5(61.7)\n | 24.4(75.9)\n | 26.9(80.4)\n | 32.0(89.6)\n | 37.4(99.3)\n | 38.0(100.4)\n | 39.7(103.5)\n | 40.0(104.0)\n | 37.5(99.5)\n | 31.8(89.2)\n | 27.3(81.1)\n | 20.8(69.4)\n | 40.0(104.0)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 5.9(42.6)\n | 8.8(47.8)\n | 14.2(57.6)\n | 20.6(69.1)\n | 25.7(78.3)\n | 28.7(83.7)\n | 30.8(87.4)\n | 31.3(88.3)\n | 27.0(80.6)\n | 22.0(71.6)\n | 14.9(58.8)\n | 7.9(46.2)\n | 19.8(67.6)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 1.1(34.0)\n | 3.5(38.3)\n | 8.4(47.1)\n | 14.5(58.1)\n | 19.7(67.5)\n | 23.4(74.1)\n | 26.3(79.3)\n | 26.7(80.1)\n | 22.1(71.8)\n | 16.2(61.2)\n | 9.4(48.9)\n | 3.0(37.4)\n | 14.5(58.1)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | −2.9(26.8)\n | −1.1(30.0)\n | 3.3(37.9)\n | 8.8(47.8)\n | 14.1(57.4)\n | 18.8(65.8)\n | 22.8(73.0)\n | 23.1(73.6)\n | 18.0(64.4)\n | 11.4(52.5)\n | 4.8(40.6)\n | −1.2(29.8)\n | 10.0(50.0)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −20.2(−4.4)\n | −16.4(2.5)\n | −10.9(12.4)\n | −6.0(21.2)\n | 1.8(35.2)\n | 7.8(46.0)\n | 11.3(52.3)\n | 12.3(54.1)\n | 6.2(43.2)\n | −2.0(28.4)\n | −8.6(16.5)\n | −15.2(4.6)\n | −20.2(−4.4)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 18.6(0.73)\n | 25.4(1.00)\n | 49.0(1.93)\n | 70.6(2.78)\n | 77.9(3.07)\n | 129.2(5.09)\n | 223.9(8.81)\n | 245.3(9.66)\n | 142.4(5.61)\n | 50.1(1.97)\n | 29.7(1.17)\n | 18.7(0.74)\n | 1,080.8(42.55)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.1 mm) | 4.5\n | 4.7\n | 7.1\n | 8.2\n | 8.8\n | 9.4\n | 13.9\n | 13.4\n | 9.3\n | 5.2\n | 5.1\n | 4.4\n | 94.0\n |\n| Average snowy days\n | 4.2\n | 2.2\n | 1.4\n | 0.1\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.5\n | 3.0\n | 11.4\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 51.4\n | 49.8\n | 49.8\n | 50.8\n | 55.8\n | 63.8\n | 71.7\n | 72.2\n | 69.3\n | 62.8\n | 58.2\n | 53.3\n | 59.1\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 195.5\n | 188.6\n | 210.8\n | 220.2\n | 232.6\n | 175.1\n | 153.0\n | 156.6\n | 164.0\n | 206.2\n | 183.9\n | 189.4\n | 2,275.9\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 62.2\n | 60.3\n | 54.7\n | 56.1\n | 52.7\n | 42.1\n | 34.1\n | 39.5\n | 43.2\n | 58.1\n | 58.3\n | 62.7\n | 50.9\n |\n| Average ultraviolet index | 2\n | 4\n | 5\n | 7\n | 9\n | 10\n | 10\n | 10\n | 8\n | 5\n | 3\n | 2\n | 6\n |\n| Source 1: Korea Meteorological Administration (percent sunshine 1981–2010)[32][33][34] |\n| Source 2: Weather Atlas (UV)[35] |\n\nThe climate of Gunwi County, which is the northern area of Daegu and was incorporated into Daegu Metropolitan City from North Gyeongsang Province in July 2023, is quite different from most parts of Daegu.

The major industries are textiles, metals and machinery. In the year 2021, Daegu had a regional GDP of $44,144 million. Many companies such as Daegu Bank, Korea Delphi, Hwasung corp., and TaeguTec are situated in this city, and Samsung and Kolon were founded here. Numerous factories are located in the industrial complexes situated in the west and north sides of the city including the Seongseo Industrial Complex, West Daegu Industrial Complex and the Daegu Dyeing Industrial Complex.\n\n\nThe city is the economic and industrial core of the Daegu-Gyeongbuk region, one of the major industrial areas in Korea. It accounted for as much as 94 percent of Korea's trade surplus in 2006.[36] The electronics industries in Gumi and the steel industries in Pohang provided great services to that surplus. World-leading manufacturing facilities for Anycall (Samsung Mobile) and POSCO's main factories are located near the city. Daegu and its neighbouring cities were designated for the Daegu-Gyeongbuk Free Economic Zone by the central government in 2008. It is specialized companies like Winitech software company in knowledge-based service and manufacturing industries.\n\n\nHistorically, Daegu has been the commercial center of the southern part of the Korean Peninsula with Seoul in the center and Pyongyang in the north (currently North Korea), because of its advantageous location. Some of the large, traditional markets like Seomun Market are still flourishing in the city.\n\n\nAdditionally, Daegu was considered the third major economic city in Korea, after Seoul and Busan. However, due to the decline of the textile industry, which is the heart of Daegu's economy, the overall economic growth of the city has also fallen.\n\n\nAlso, the city is the warmest region in South Korea due to the humid subtropical climate. This climate condition provides the region with high quality apples and oriental melons. The fruit industry is a crucial support for the local economy. Due to the stagnant economy, Daegu's population began to decrease after 2003. Recently, the local government has begun focusing on working towards economic revival and concentrating on improving the city's fashion industry.\n\n\n\n![](image)Daegu International Future Auto EXPO 2017\n![](image)Korean ICT Convergence Expo\n![](image)Korean Brain Research Center - Advanced Equipment Center\n![](image)2017 Green Energy Expo\n### Fashion industry[edit]\n\n\nBeginning in the late 1990s, Daegu has been actively making efforts to promote its fashion industry based on its textile and clothing manufacturing industries under the 'Daegu: Fashion City'. The city opens many exhibitions related to the fashion and textile industries including the Daegu Fashion Fair and Preview in Daegu annually or semi-annually, and invites national institutes. A large new town specializing in the textile-fashion industries is currently under construction in Bongmu-dong, northeastern Daegu. The district, officially named Esiapolis, takes aim at the fashion hub of East Asia. Textile complexes, textile-fashion institutions, an international school, fashion malls as well as residential areas plan to be developed in the district.[37]\n\n\n\n## Culture and sightseeing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Daegu skyline as seen from KNU's Technopark\nGenerally, Daegu is known as a conservative city. As well as being the largest inland city in the country beside Seoul it has become one of the major metropolitan areas in the nation. Traditionally, Buddhism has been strong; today there are still many temples. Confucianism is also popular in Daegu, with a large academy based in the city. Neon cross-topped spires of Christian churches can also be seen in the city.\n\n\n\n### Sights[edit]\n\n\nThe most well-known sight of the city is the stone Buddha called Gatbawi on the top of Gwanbong, Palgongsan. It is famous for its stone gat (Korean traditional hat). People from all over the country visit the place, because they believe that the Buddha will grant one's single desire.[38] Administratively, the site itself is located in the neighboring city, Gyeongsan, Gyeongbuk.\n\n\n\n![](image)Scenery of Donghwasa\nOn the outskirts of the city, mountains keep many traditional temples such as Donghwasa, Pagyesa, and Buinsa. Donghwasa is a Buddhist temple that was built by Priest Geukdal-hwasang in 493, and many artifacts of the period are found around the temple. The International Tourist Zen Meditation Center is Korea's only Zen-themed center. Some lecture halls or memorial halls such as Dodong-seowon (도동서원; 道東書院) and Nokdong-seowon (녹동서원; 鹿洞書院) are also located in the suburbs.\n\n\nOld villages have been preserved, such as the Otgol village (*Gyeongju Choi* clan's original residence area) and the Inheung village (*Nampyeong Mun'*s). In the urban area, the Joseon Dynasty's administrative or educational buildings including Gyeongsang-gamyeong (경상감영, 慶尙監營) and Daegu-hyanggyo (대구향교, 大邱鄕校) also remain. The main gateway of the city in that period called Yeongnam-jeilmun (영남제일문, 嶺南第一門, meaning the first gateway in Yeongnam), has been restored in Mangudang Park. Western style modern architecture like Gyesan Cathedral and the old building of Jeil Church are preserved across the urban area. Gyesan Cathedral is the third oldest gothic church building in Korea[39] and the cathedral of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Daegu which is one of three archdioceses in South Korea. Several buildings, in the present Keisung Academy and the KNU middle/high school, are famous too.\n\n\nYangnyeongsi (약령시, 藥令市) in Namseongno (often called Yakjeon-golmok) is the oldest market for Korean medicinal herbs in the country with a history of 350 years. Bongsan-dong which has some art galleries and studios is being developed as the artistic center of the city since the 1990s.\n\n\nNearby tourist attractions include Haeinsa—a Buddhist temple that houses the *Tripitaka Koreana* (a woodblock edition of the *Tripitaka* and one of the world's oldest extant complete collections of the Buddhist scriptures). Haeinsa is located in Gayasan National Park of Hapcheon, Gyeongnam. The historic city of Gyeongju, Gyeongbuk, the capital of the ancient kingdom of Silla is located east of Daegu.\n\n\n\n### Mountains and parks[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of parks in Daegu\n\n![](image)Dalgubeol-daejong, a city bell at the Gukchae Bosang Park\n![](image)Daegu Botanical Garden bridge\nMt. Palgong, Mt. Biseul, and Mt. Ap are the representative mountains in Daegu. Apsan, just in the southern part of the city, is the closest mountain from the urban area among them. It has many trails, Buddhist temples, a Korean War museum, and a gondola ride to the peak. Additionally, Waryongsan, Hamjisan, and Yongjibong are located in the city. These serve as neighborhood parks to the citizens. Mt. Palgong has a cable car to the summit.[40] There are also hiking trails in the direction of the Donghwasa Temple and Sutaegol Valley.\n\n\nIn the urban area, several small mountains and hills play the same role. Dalseong Park, which sits inside a 1,500-year-old earth fortress, is a historic place of the city. It contains the city's only zoo and some monuments as well as the wall. Duryu Park or Duryusan is a large forest in the middle of the urban area. It has Daegu Tower, Woobang Land, Kolon Bandstand, Duryu Stadium, and many sports facilities. Daegu Tower, also called Woobang Tower or Duryu Tower, is the tallest contemporary structure (202 m) and a symbol of the city. Its observatory commands good views of the surroundings. Woobang Land is the largest amusement park out of the capital area. Many small gardens lie in the heart of the city, such as the National Debt Repayment Movement Memorial Park (Gukchae Bosang Park) and 2·28 Park. The former park includes Dalgubeol-daejong (달구벌대종, 達句伐大鐘), which means the Dalgubeol grand bell. The bell is struck every week and year. There is also a botanical garden with a variety of plants and flowers.\n\n\n\n### Downtown and shopping[edit]\n\n\nDongseongno (동성로, 東城路) is the downtown of Daegu lying from the Daegu Station to *Jung-ang pachulso* (central police station) near the Banwoldang subway station in the center of the city Jung-gu. It has the Jung-angno subway station as the nearest station from its heart. Like its name meaning the street in the east fortress, the eastern part of Daegu-eupseong (대구읍성, 大邱邑城, means the Daegu-Principality Fortress) was situated along this street. The fortress, however, had been demolished in the early 20th century. Although Daegu is the nation's third or fourth largest city, the Dongseongno area form the largest and the broadest downtown area in the whole country except the capital city, Seoul. In most cases, famous brands open their branch shop first here out of the Greater Seoul area.[41]\n\n\n\n![](image)The sign of the Seomun Market\nSub-downtowns in the city have its own commercial powers and colors. The area around the Seongseo Industrial Complex subway station in Dalseo-gu is a concentration of many amusement spots, and young people easily can be seen around Kyungpook National University in Buk-gu. *Deuran-gil* (means the street inside the field) in Suseong-gu is known for many restaurants.\n\n\nThe city has a number of department stores. Many of these belong to national or multinational chains, but the local Daegu Department Store also operates two branches, while another local chain, Donga Department Store operates four in the city proper. The six department stores among them gather at the downtown. The traditional markets such as Seomun Market and Chilseong Market sell all sorts of goods.\n\n\n\n### Festivals[edit]\n\n\nMany traditional ceremonies and festivals in agrarian society disappeared in the process of modernization. A Confucian ritual ceremony called *Seokjeondaeje* is held at Daegu-hyanggyo every spring and autumn. The Yangnyeongsi herb medical festival and Otgol village festival are the contemporary festivals about traditional culture.\n\n\nLately in the city, enthusiasm about performing arts is growing and the local government is trying to meet its demand. Daegu International Opera Festival (DIOF) in October since 2003, Daegu International Musical Festival (DIMF), and Daegu International Bodypainting Festival (DIBF) are three of the most famous festivals on each field in Korea, although those have short histories.\n\n\nVarious festivals in various themes like the Colorful Daegu Festival, Dongseongno festival, Palgongsan maple festival, Biseulsan azalea festival, Korea in Motion Daegu, and so on, are held by the city, each ward, or the specific groups, all through the year.\n\n\nOn August 25 through August 31, 2008, Daegu hosted the first ever Asian Bodypainting Festival, a sister event of the World Bodypainting Festival in Seeboden, Austria.\n\n\nEach year the city is home to the Daegu International Jazz Festival: http://www.dijf.or.kr/\n\n\nEvery May the \"Colorful Daegu Festival\" offers performances and art programs including the Colorful Parade.[42] In July, the Daegu Chimac Festival takes place at Duryu Park in Dalseo-gu, Daegu. The term \"chimac\" is a portmanteau of chicken and maekju (meaning \"beer\"). There were over 880,000 visitors in 2015, and one million visitors during the festival in 2016.[43]\n\n\n\n### Daegu 12 Views Gallery[edit]\n\n\nThe 12 scenic spots of Daegu selected by Daegu Metropolitan City include Palgongsan Mountain, Biseulsan Mountain, Gangjeong Goryeongbo (The Ark), Sincheon, Suseongmot Lake, Dalseongtoseong Fortress, Gyeongsang Gamyeong Park, National Debt Compensation Memorial Park, Dongseongro, Seomun Market, and Daegu Stadium. \n\n\n\n* ![1st view Palgongsan](image)\n\n1st view Palgongsan\n* ![2nd view of Biseulsan](image)\n\n2nd view of Biseulsan\n* ![3rd view Gangjeong Goryeong Weir (The Arc)](image)\n\n3rd view Gangjeong Goryeong Weir (The Ark)\n* ![4 Scenic Sincheon](image)\n\n4th Scenic Sincheon\n* ![5 Scenic Spots Suseongmot Lake](image)\n\n5th Scenic Spots Suseongmot Lake\n* ![6 Scenic Dalseongtoseong Fortress](image)\n\n6th Dalseongtoseong Fortress\n* ![7 Scenic Gyeongsang Gamyeong Park](image)\n\n7th Gyeongsang Gamyeong Park\n* ![8th National Debt Compensation Memorial Park](image)\n\n8th Scenic Spots: National Debt Compensation Memorial Park\n* ![9th view Dongseongro](image)\n\n9th view Dongseongro\n* ![10th Seomun Market](image)\n\n10th Seomun Market\n* ![11th Scenery 83 Tower](image)\n\n11th Scenery 83 Tower\n* ![12th view Daegu Stadium](image)\n\n12th view Daegu Stadium\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nDaegu cuisine is similar to that consumed in the Yeongnam region. The city is known for certain unique dishes such as:\n\n\n\n* *Ttaro-gukbap*: Daegu is the only part of Korea that eats the rice and soup of gukbap separately\n* *Mungtigi*: pieces of raw beef marinated in a mixture of sesame oil, garlic, and red pepper powder\n* *Makchang*: a dish made with beef abomasum\n* *Jjimgalbi*: braised beef ribs cooked in an aluminum pot with a deep spicy, sweet, and garlicky marinade\n* *Nonmegi maeuntang*: a spicy catfish stew made with a kelp and radish stock\n* *Bogeo bulgogi*: deboned blowfish grilled with beansprouts in a spicy marinade\n* *Muchimhoe*: a salad composed of raw fish, squid, and vegetables in a sweet and spicy sauce\n* *Yaki udon*: spicy seafood noodle dish with vegetables, similar to a dry jjamppong\n* *Napjak mandu*: thin dumplings filled with small amounts of dangmyeon and vegetables\n\n\nCuisine\n* ![Ttaro-gukbap](image)\n\nTtaro-gukbap\n* ![Mungtigi](image)\n\nMungtigi\n* ![Jjimgalbi](image)\n\nJjimgalbi\n* ![Nonmegi maeuntang](image)\n\nNonmegi maeuntang\n* ![Bogeo bulgogi](image)\n\nBogeo bulgogi\n* ![Nureun guksu](image)\n\nNureun guksu\n* ![Yaki udon](image)\n\nYaki udon\n* ![Napjak mandu](image)\n\nNapjak mandu\n\n### Museums[edit]\n\n\n* Daegu Art Museum\n\n\n![](image)Daegu Art Museum\n* Daegu National Museum – A notable national museum collecting relics excavated in and around Daegu\n* Daegu Bangjja Yugi (Korean Bronzeware) Museum\n* Hengso Museum of Keimyung University\n* Korea Video Museum\n* Kyungpook National University Museum\n* Museum for Daegu National University of Education\n* Museum of Natural Dye Arts\n* National Debt Repayment Movement Memorial Museum\n\n\n### Theaters[edit]\n\n\n* Daegu Opera House – The first theater in Korea only for performing opera\n* Suseong Artpia\n* Keimyung Art Center Archived 2013-08-27 at the Wayback Machine – One of the largest scale theaters in the city.\n* Daegu Culture and Arts Center\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nOn March 27, 2007, the city was selected to host the 2011 World Championships in Athletics. Daegu competed with cities such as Moscow, Russia, and Brisbane, Australia, to earn the votes of the IAAF Council. The event was the fourth IAAF World Championships in Athletics to be held outside Europe, and the first games in mainland Asia. It was also the third worldwide sports event held in Korea after the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul and 2002 FIFA World Cup in Korea and Japan, in which Daegu hosted four matches. It also hosted the 2003 Summer Universiade.[6] The city hosts the Colorful Daegu Pre-Championships Meeting every year since 2005.\n\n\nDaegu Stadium is the second largest sports complex in South Korea with a seating capacity of 66,422. Daegu Civic Stadium hosted some football matches at the 1988 Summer Olympics.\n\n\nThe Daegu Marathon is held here every year in April. The race begins and ends at the Daegu Stadium.\n\n\n\n#### Sports teams[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Club\n | Sport\n | League\n | Venue\n | Established\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Samsung Lions | Baseball\n | KBO League | Daegu Samsung Lions Park | 1982\n |\n| Daegu FC | Football\n | K League 1 | DGB Daegu Bank Park | 2003\n |\n| Daegu KOGAS Pegasus | Basketball\n | Korean Basketball League | Daegu Gymnasium\n | 1994\n |\n\n\n##### Samsung Lions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A home stadium of the Samsung Lions, one of the most popular sports teams in the city\nThe Samsung Lions are a professional baseball team founded in 1982. They are based in the southeastern city of Daegu and are members of the KBO League. Their home stadium is Daegu Samsung Lions Park. They have won the Korean Series eight times. The Samsung Lions are the first team to win four consecutive Korean Series titles (2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014). They are also the first Korean team to win a regular league title for five consecutive years (2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015).\n\n\n\n##### Daegu FC[edit]\n\n\n![](image)DGB Daegu Bank Park\nDaegu Football Club was founded as a community club at the end of 2002, and made their K League debut in 2003. Historically, Daegu have often placed in the lower reaches of the K League. Their best season to date has been 2021, when they finished third out of twelve teams. They were also the winners of the Korean FA Cup in 2018, which qualified the club for their first appearance in the AFC Champions League the following year. The club has since played in the 2021 and 2022 editions of AFC Champions League.\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nThere are three terrestrial TV broadcasting stations in the city: KBS Daegu Broadcast Station, Daegu MBC, and TBC. These are affiliated companies of central broadcasting stations in Seoul just like other local broadcasting companies in South Korea. TBC (Taegu Broadcasting Corporation) depends on SBS. They cover to Gyeongsangbuk-do out of the city. Each television broadcasting company has its own radio station as well.\n\n\n\n### International Daegu[edit]\n\n\nDaegu is largely a homogeneous community that includes few non-Koreans. However, a number of immigrants from South and Southeast Asia work in automotive-parts factories on the city's west side. In addition, there is a small group of English-speaking Westerners working in English schools and university programs. The American military bases are also home to several hundred Americans. Recently Chinese students have begun studying Korean at universities in Daegu, and there is an increasing number of graduate and post-graduate students from other Asian countries. As elsewhere in Korea, Korean food overwhelmingly dominates; Chinese, Japanese and Western food forms the bulk of non-Korean food but recently Indian and Russian foods have become available.\n\n\nDaegu hosts three American military bases, Camp Henry, Camp George which houses Daegu American School, and Camp Walker. Camp Walker houses Daegu High School for high school children, while Camp George hold the school for elementary and middle school (both of which are primarily for children of military personnel and US Military civilian employees). Camp George also houses most of the married [Enlisted] ranked soldiers. Camp Henry and Camp Walker serve as the primary place of work for all the military personnel. Camp Walker serves as the home to enlisted Sergeants Major and Officer ranked soldiers, Major and up. Although non-military families can enroll their children at the school, most either home-school their children or send them to a small Christian private school which teaches about 25 children near the central business district of Daegu.\n\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nReligion in Daegu (2015)[44]\n\n\n\nNot religious (55.8%)\nBuddhism (23.8%)\nProtestantism (12%)\nCatholicism (7.7%)\nOther (0.7%)\n\nAccording to the census of 2015, 23.8% of the population followed Buddhism and 19.7% followed Christianity (12% Protestantism and 7.7% Catholicism). 55.8% of the population is irreligious.[44]\n\n\n**Mosque Controversy** In December 2020, construction of a mosque in Daehyeon-dong for a Muslim community of 80-150 members comprising mainly staff and students of a local university, resulted in opposition from nearby residents who complained about the change in land use without prior consultation.[45][1] Construction was halted in 2021 by the district administrative office (having originally been approved by the same office) after residents voiced concerns. This suspension was later judged by The National Human Rights Commission of Korea (NHRCK) to be based on discrimination and prejudice against Muslims. Insulting and offensive messages, considered by the NHRCK as akin to hate-speech, and the heads of pigs displayed within glass-fronted refrigerators, were subsequently left near the mosque construction site; the identity and precise motive of the culprits remain uncertain.[46] Due to proximity to the mosque and its being seen as an intentional insult to Islam and the Muslim community, local residents were strongly criticized for holding a social barbeque/picnic in their neighbourhood in which pork (the most frequently eaten red meat in South Korea) was served. The approval for change of land use within a residential area without consultation with local residents indicates a failure by the local district office to adequately support both communities, and of the authorities to mediate effective communication between the two groups. Notably, the Muslim community did not disseminate information to the local residents on its plans, despite local awareness of Muslim worship within a house on the site since 2014, and general acceptance of what some residents saw as night-time disturbance during the time of Ramadan.[47] Since the dispute began however, dialogue between the local residents and the Muslim community has been hampered by third parties in Korea, according to the Muslim community spokesperson.[46] As of May 2023, construction was underway; differences had not been resolved.[46]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Education in South Korea\n\nAs of 2021[update], Daegu has 232 elementary schools, 125 middle schools, and 94 high schools.[48] There are two specialized public high schools which are Daegu Science High School and Taegu Foreign Language High School, and some other high schools such as Keisung Academy, Gyeongsin High School and Daeryun High School have good grades for university admission. Most of the well-known high schools are located in Suseong-gu because its educational grade and zeal are high standard in the country.\n\n\nAlso, Daegu has 4 independent private high schools like **Keisung Academy** (also called Keisung High School), Gyeongsin High School, **Gyeong-il Girl's High School**, **Daegun Catholic High School**.\n\n\n\n### Universities and colleges[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kyungpook National University, School of Medicine\n![](image)Keimyung University, main building\nDaegu and its satellite towns are one of the areas which have the largest private higher educational institutions in Korea. Many of their main campuses are located in the nearby Gyeongsan city which serves the Daegu region as a college town. Kyungpook National University (KNU) is one of the most highly ranked and well organized national universities in Korea. It holds high ranks in and around the city in many academic fields, while DGIST(Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology) is recognized as one of Korea's top universities in the field of science and technology. DGIST is one of four ISTs in Korea, along with KAIST, UNIST and GIST. It was established under 'The Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology Act (Act 699)' enacted on December 11, 2003. In 2019, DGIST was selected as 'Top 25 Rising Young Universities'.[49] Daegu has two of the most prestigious private universities outside Seoul, Yeungnam University (YU) and Keimyung University. There are some smaller private universities such as Catholic University of Daegu and Daegu University. Daegu National University of Education offers elementary education training.\n\n\nThe other universities and colleges include Daegu Arts University, Daegu Cyber University, Daegu Haany University, Daegu Health College, Daegu Mirae College, Daegu Polytechnic College, Daegu Technical College, Daeshin University, Keimyung University, Kyongbuk Science College, Kyungil University, Taekyeung College, Yeungjin College, Yeungnam College of Science and Technology, and Youngnam Theological College and Seminary.\n\n\n\n#### Medical institutions[edit]\n\n\nSome large university hospitals make the city the medical hub of south-eastern Korea. The Kyungpook National University Hospital, founded as *Daegu-dongin-uiwon* in 1907 by the Japanese, is the best-known hospital in the city. The Dongsan Hospital (attached to Keimyung University), founded as *Jejungwon* in 1899, is one of the oldest western style medical clinics in Korea. The Yeungnam University Medical Center has the largest number of beds in the city. The yearly treatment amount of these tertiary hospitals is the second largest in South Korea after that of Seoul.[50] The Daegu Catholic University Medical Center is also included in them.\n\n\n\n### Primary and secondary schools[edit]\n\n\n* Hamji High School\n* Kangbuk High School\n* Maecheon High School\n* Seongsan High School\n\n\nInternational schools in Daegu include:\n\n\n\n* Daegu International School[51]\n* Daegu Chinese Elementary School or Korea Daeguhwagyo Elementary School (한국대구화교초등학교)[52]\n* Overseas Chinese High School, Daegu\n\n\n### Elementary schools[edit]\n\n\nGlobal schools:\n\n\n\n* Daegu Sindang Elementary School\n\n\nDaegu Sindang Elementary School is a public elementary school located in Dalseo-gu, Daegu. The school's motto is \"To raise children who are upright, wise, and strong\", and its emblem and flower are the magnolia and pine tree, respectively. Daegu Sindang Elementary School has a history of excellence in sports, music and academics, and has won numerous awards in these fields. It is also a designated school for creative education and a leading school for after-school programmes. In 2020, a group of students from Daegu Sindang Elementary School won first place in the Korean National Championship of the FIRST LEGO League (FLL) robotics competition.[53]\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\n### Rail[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Dongdaegu Station\nDaegu is the hub of the Korean inland railroad traffic. The main railroad of the country, Gyeongbu Line passes through the city. The largest railroad station in the city, Dongdaegu Station, has the second largest passenger traffic in Korea after Seoul Station, it is the number one station in Korea for train stops, and the largest train traffic.[54] All trains passing through Dongdaegu Station make a mandatory stop. The station re-opened in 2004 after extensive renovations serving the KTX highspeed train, Saemaul and Mugunghwa trains. All kinds of trains except KTX depart from Daegu Station, an all-new building with cinemas, restaurants and a department store, located near the city centre. It has the tenth largest passenger traffic in Korea.[54] Daegu Line branches off from Gacheon station of Gyeongbu Line.\n\n\n\n### Metro[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Daegu Metro\n\n![](image)Map of the rapid transit of Daegu. The red line is line 1, and the green is line 2.\nThe city also has a metro system, consisting of two heavy rail lines. Line 1 crosses the city from northeast to southwest, while Line 2 crosses from west to east. Line 3 from northwest to southeast is an elevated monorail. All the lines are and will be operated by the Daegu Metropolitan Transit Corporation (DTRO). Another line will operate in a few years as a heavy rail system using the Gumi–Daegu–Gyeongsan section of Gyeongbu Line. Line 4 is a long-range plan and will be a circle line. Fare is 1400 won and 1250 won with a prepaid card. There is a free interchange scheme between the metro and bus within an hour of first use for the prepaid card users.\n\n\nIt started a full-fledged health-sharing stairway project by installing \"Seven-color melody health donation stairs\" at Shinmae Station and Imdang Station on Daegu Subway Line 2. Using these stairs, LED lights turn on with the sound of the keyboard. And a donation of ₩10(won) per session goes to those in need (such as pediatric cancer centers and low-income families).[55]\n\n\n\n### Road[edit]\n\n\nThere are two types of buses which are local and limited express. Limited express buses have more seats, but often passengers are required to stand. As of 2020[update], Local bus fare costs around 1,400 won with cash, Limited express bus fare would set you back 1,800 won. Discounted fare is available with a prepaid card.[56]\n\n\nBus route numbers are made up with 3 digits, each number indicates the area that bus serves. For example, number 407 bus runs from zone four, to zone zero, and then to zone seven. Other routes, usually circular, are named for the districts they serve and numbered 1 through 3.\n\n\nTraffic is sometimes heavy, however, the major thoroughfares handle fairly high volumes of traffic without too much trouble.\n\n\n\n![](image)Daegu International Airport\n### Air[edit]\n\n\nDaegu is served by Daegu International Airport, located in northeastern Daegu. As of July, 2022, international destinations include China, Thailand, the Philippines, and Mongolia.\n\n\n\n### Bus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n* Daegu Buses [ko]\n\n\n## Others[edit]\n\n\n### Accidents[edit]\n\n\n* The Frog Boys, this incident is an unsolved case. 5 boys were killed by the criminal in 1991. Boys failed to return after going out to pick up the salamander eggs, and people often call the case \"The frog boys case\".\n* The 1995 Daegu gas explosions killed 101 and injured 202. A pagoda for consolation of the dead was erected in Haksan park.\n* The Daegu subway fire occurred on February 18, 2003, when an arsonist, \"Kim Dae-Han\" set fire to a train at the Jungangno Station of the Daegu Metropolitan Subway in Daegu, South Korea.

Daegu and surrounding North Gyeongsang Province are often referred to as Daegu-Gyeongbuk, with a total population over 5 million.\n\n\nDaegu is located in south-eastern Korea about 80 km (50 mi) from the seacoast, near the Geumho River and its mainstream, Nakdong River in Gyeongsang-do. The Daegu basin is the central plain of the Yeongnam region. In ancient times, the Daegu area was part of the proto-kingdom Jinhan. Subsequently, Daegu came under the control of the Silla Kingdom, which unified the Korean Peninsula. During the Joseon Dynasty period, the city was the capital of Gyeongsang-do, one of the traditional eight provinces of the country.\n\n\nDaegu was an economic motor of Korea during the 1960s–1980s period and was especially known for its electronics industry. The humid subtropical climate of Daegu is ideal for producing high-quality apples, thus the nickname, \"Apple City\".[4] Daegu is also known as \"Textile City\".[5] Textiles used to be the pillar industry of the city. With the establishment of the Daegu-Gyeongbuk Free Economic Zone, Daegu is currently focusing on fostering fashion and high-tech industries.\n\n\nDaegu was the host city of the 22nd World Energy Congress, the 2011 World Championships in Athletics and the 2003 Summer Universiade.[6] It also hosted four matches in the 2002 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Daegu\n\n### Prehistory and early history[edit]\n\n\nArchaeological investigations in the Greater Daegu area have revealed a large number of settlements and burials of the prehistoric Mumun Pottery Period (around 1500–300 BC). In fact, some of the earliest evidence of Mumun settlement in Gyeongsangdo have been excavated from Siji-dong and Seobyeon-dong.[7] Dongcheon-dong is one of the substantial Mumun agricultural villages that have been excavated.[8] The Dongcheon-dong site dates back to the Middle Mumun (around 850–550 BC) and contains the remains of many prehistoric pit-houses and agricultural fields. Megalithic burials (dolmens) have also been found in large numbers in Daegu.\n\n\nAncient historical texts indicate that during the Proto–Three Kingdoms (Mahan, Jinhan, and Byeonhan) period, Daegu was the site of a chiefdom or walled-town polity known from that time, according to historical records, as Dalgubeol. It was absorbed into the kingdom of Silla no later than the fifth century. The vestiges of the wall can be seen, and relics have been excavated in the current Dalseong Park.\n\n\n\n![](image)Reliquary from eighth-century Silla, Daegu National Museum\n### Silla[edit]\n\n\nSilla succeeded in unifying the Korean peninsula by defeating the other kingdoms of Baekje and Goguryeo in the late seventh century, partly due to assistance from China's Tang Dynasty. Shortly thereafter, in 689, Silla's King Sinmun considered moving the capital from Gyeongju to Daegu, but was unable to do so.[9] This initiative is known only through a single line in the *Samguk Sagi*, a most valued historical record of ancient Korea by Koryeo Dynasty historian Kim Bu-sik, but it is presumed to indicate both an attempt by the Silla king to reinforce royal authority and the entrenched resistance of the Gyeongju political elites that was the likely cause of the move's failure.[10] The city was given its current name in 757.\n\n\nIn the late 1990s, archaeologists excavated a large-scale fortified Silla site in Dongcheon-dong, Buk-gu.[11] The site at Locality 2 consists of the remains of 39 raised-floor buildings enclosed by a formidable ditch-and-palisade system. The excavators hypothesize that the fortified site was a permanent military encampment or barracks. Archaeologists also uncovered a large Silla village dating to the sixth to seventh centuries AD at Siji-dong.[7]\n\n\n\n### Later Three Kingdoms and Goryeo[edit]\n\n\nDuring the Later Three Kingdoms period, 892–936, Daegu was initially aligned with Hubaekje. In 927, northern Daegu was the site of the Battle of Gong Mountain between the forces of Goryeo under Wang Geon and those of Hubaekje under Gyeon Hwon. In this battle, the forces of Goryeo were crushed and Wang Geon himself was saved only by the heroic deed of his general Shin Sung-gyeom. However, the atrocities of the Hubaekje forces at this time apparently changed local sympathizers to favor Wang Geon, who later became the king of Goryeo.\n\n\nNumerous place names and local legends in the area still bear witness to the historic battle of 927. Among these are \"Ansim\", which literally means \"peace of mind\", said to be the first place where Wang Geon dared to stop after escaping the battle, and \"Banwol\", or half-moon, where he is said to have stopped and admired the moon before returning to Goryeo. A statue commemorating the battle now stands in northern Daegu, as does a memorial to Sin Sunggyeom.\n\n\nIn the Goryeo period, the first edition of the *Tripitaka Koreana* was stored in Daegu, at the temple of Buinsa.[12] However, this edition was destroyed when the temple was sacked in 1254, during the Mongol invasions of Korea.[13]\n\n\n\n### Joseon[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Daegu in the 18th century\nDaegu served as an important transportation center during the Joseon Dynasty, being located in the middle of the Great Yeongnam Road which ran between Seoul and Busan, at the junction of this arterial road and the roads to Gyeongju and Jinju.\n\n\nIn 1601, Daegu became the administrative capital of the Gyeongsang-do, which is current Daegu, Busan, Ulsan, Gyeongsangbuk-do, and Gyeongsangnam-do. At about that time, the city began to grow into a major city. The status continued for nearly 300 years, and the city has been transformed as the capital of Gyeongsangbuk-do since Gyeongsang-do was divided into two provinces, Gyeongsangbuk-do (northern Gyeongsang-province) and Gyeongsangnam-do (southern one) in 1896.\n\n\nDaegu's first regular markets were established during the late Joseon period. The most famous of these is the Yangnyeongsi herbal medicine market. This became a center of herbal trade in Joseon, and even attracted buyers from neighboring countries. Traders from Japan, who were not permitted to leave the Nakdong River valley, hired messengers to visit the market on their behalf. Seomun Market, which stood at the city's west gate at that time, was one of the top-three markets in the Joseon period.\n\n\n\n### Korean Empire and colonial rule[edit]\n\n\nJapanese imperialism forcibly opened up Korea's markets beginning in the late 19th century. In 1895, Daegu became the site of one of the country's first modern post offices, as a part of the 'Gab-o' reforms introduced in the aftermath of the First Sino-Japanese war.[14]\n\n\nBeginning in the late 1890s, increasing numbers of foreign merchants and workers started to visit Daegu, which emerged as a modern transportation center of the newly constructed Gyeongbu Line main railroad connecting Seoul and Busan.\n\n\nIn 1905, the old fortress wall was forcibly destroyed. As a tribute to the wall, streets that now run where the wall once stood have been named Bukseongno, Namseongno, Dongseongno and Seoseongno, which translates as \"north fortress street\", \"south fortress street\", \"east fortress street\" and \"west fortress street\" respectively.\n\n\n\n![](image)\n{| style=\"width:.5ex;margin:2px;padding:1px;border:1px solid #000000;\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n|大 ·邱\n|\n\n\n\n|} Emblem of Taikyu-fu (Daegu Prefecture), when Daegu was under Japanese rule\n![](image)\nDaegu Metropolitan City Characters\n\nIndependence movements against imperial aggressions were outstanding in Daegu. These began as early as 1898, when a branch of the Independence Club was opened in the town.[15] As the demise of the Korean Empire approached in 1907, local citizens led by Seo Sang-don organized the National Debt Repayment Movement. The movement spread nationwide, although it fell short of repaying the national debt through individual donations. Freedom fighting continued after the 1910 annexation, notably during the March 1st movement of 1919. At that time, four major demonstrations took place in Daegu, involving an estimated 23,000 peace-loving citizens.[16]\n\n\n\n### After 1945[edit]\n\n\nIn 1946, the Daegu October Incident took place, one of the most serious social disorders since the foundation of the Republic of Korea.[17] On October 1, Korean national police killed three student demonstrators and injured many others.[18] It was also the site of major demonstrations on February 28, 1960, prior to the presidential election of that year.[19]\n\n\nDaegu and all of North Gyeongsang province had heavy guerrilla activities in the late 1940s, as thousands of refugees shied away from the fighting in Jeolla province and sought shelters in Daegu.[20] In November 1948, a unit in Daegu joined the mutiny which had begun in Yeosu the previous month.[21] As in many other areas during the Korean War, political killings of dissenters were widespread.\n\n\nDuring the Korean War, heavy fighting occurred nearby along the Nakdong River. Daegu sat inside the Pusan Perimeter, however, so it remained in South Korean hands throughout the war. The fighting that prevented North Korean troops from crossing the Nakdong River has become known as the Battle of Taegu.\n\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, the city underwent explosive growth, and the population has increased more than tenfold since the end of the Korean War. The city was politically favored during the 18-year-long rule of Park Chung Hee, when it and the surrounding area served as his political base. Daegu champions conservative political ideas and movements today and is a political base for the Saenuri Party.\n\n\nIn the 1980s, Daegu separated from Gyeongsangbuk-do and became a separately administered provincial-level directly governed city (*Jikhalsi*), and was redesignated as a metropolitan city (*Gwangyeoksi*) in 1995. Today, Daegu is the third-largest metropolitan area in Korea with respect to both population and commerce.\n\n\nSince 1990, Daegu has suffered two of South Korea's worst mass casualty disasters: the 1995 Daegu gas explosions, which killed 101 people, and the 2003 Daegu subway fire, which killed 192 people.\n\n\nIn February 2020, Daegu was the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea.[22]\n\n\nIn July 2023, the Gunwi County of the North Gyeongsang Province integrated into Daegu.\n\n\n\n## Politics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Daegu City Hall\nTwo local governments are in the city, the Daegu Metropolitan Government in Jung District and Gyeongbuk Provincial Government in Buk District. The provincial government will be relocated to Andong in its proper province, Gyeongbuk. As a result, the provincial government office was relocated to Andong in January 2023. The mayor and heads of city's eight districts are directly elected by the citizens every four years. The city council has 29 members which consist of 26 from the same number of electoral districts and three proportional representations. They are also directly elected every four years. Most of them are the members of the Liberty Korea Party, the main conservative political party in South Korea. Daegu is a stronghold for the party and has produced four Presidents of the Republic of Korea thus far: Park Chung Hee, Chun Doo-hwan, Roh Tae-woo and Park Geun-hye. Park Chung Hee and Chun Doo-hwan were born in other cities but they moved to Daegu and spent childhood in Daegu. As the capital of the Korean conservatives, the city has wielded strong political influence in elections.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Administrative divisions\nMain article: List of districts and county of Daegu\n\nDaegu is divided into 7 districts (*Gu*) and 2 counties (*Gun*)\n\n\n\n* Jung District (중구, 中區) – *means the central district.*\n* Dong District (동구, 東區) – *means the east district.*\n* Seo District (서구, 西區) – *means the west district.*\n* Nam District (남구, 南區) – *means the south district.*\n* Buk District (북구, 北區) – *means the north district.*\n* Suseong District (수성구, 壽城區)\n* Dalseo District (달서구, 達西區)\n* Dalseong County (달성군, 達城郡)\n* Gunwi County (군위군, 軍威郡)\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n### Topography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)View of both the city of Daegu, with Jisan-dong and Beommul-dong\nDaegu sits in a basin surrounded by low mountains.

In Holdridge climate classification, Daegu has a warm temperate moist forest climate. The mountains that comprise the basin trap hot and humid air. Similarly, in winter, cold air lies in the basin. The area receives little precipitation except during the rainy season of summer and is sunny throughout much of the year. Data gathered since 1961 indicates that the mean temperature for January, the coldest month in Daegu, is 0.6 °C (33 °F) and that for August, the warmest month, is 26.4 °C (80 °F). The city's lowest record temperature was −20.2 °C (−4 °F),[23] and the city's highest record temperature was 40.0 °C (104 °F).[24] In 2014, high temperatures led to the emergence of a new term called Daefrica (대프리카, Daegu+Africa) starting with the internet community, and has been used in the media, broadcasting, etc.[25] In 2015, a traffic cone in Daegu melted in the heat.[26] Summers in Daegu are some of the hottest in the Korean peninsula.[27][28] In 2023, on July 31[29] and August 3,[30][31] median strips could not overcome the heat and melted in different parts of the same district in Daegu.\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Daegu (1991–2020 normals, extremes 1907–present)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 16.5(61.7)\n | 24.4(75.9)\n | 26.9(80.4)\n | 32.0(89.6)\n | 37.4(99.3)\n | 38.0(100.4)\n | 39.7(103.5)\n | 40.0(104.0)\n | 37.5(99.5)\n | 31.8(89.2)\n | 27.3(81.1)\n | 20.8(69.4)\n | 40.0(104.0)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 5.9(42.6)\n | 8.8(47.8)\n | 14.2(57.6)\n | 20.6(69.1)\n | 25.7(78.3)\n | 28.7(83.7)\n | 30.8(87.4)\n | 31.3(88.3)\n | 27.0(80.6)\n | 22.0(71.6)\n | 14.9(58.8)\n | 7.9(46.2)\n | 19.8(67.6)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 1.1(34.0)\n | 3.5(38.3)\n | 8.4(47.1)\n | 14.5(58.1)\n | 19.7(67.5)\n | 23.4(74.1)\n | 26.3(79.3)\n | 26.7(80.1)\n | 22.1(71.8)\n | 16.2(61.2)\n | 9.4(48.9)\n | 3.0(37.4)\n | 14.5(58.1)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | −2.9(26.8)\n | −1.1(30.0)\n | 3.3(37.9)\n | 8.8(47.8)\n | 14.1(57.4)\n | 18.8(65.8)\n | 22.8(73.0)\n | 23.1(73.6)\n | 18.0(64.4)\n | 11.4(52.5)\n | 4.8(40.6)\n | −1.2(29.8)\n | 10.0(50.0)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −20.2(−4.4)\n | −16.4(2.5)\n | −10.9(12.4)\n | −6.0(21.2)\n | 1.8(35.2)\n | 7.8(46.0)\n | 11.3(52.3)\n | 12.3(54.1)\n | 6.2(43.2)\n | −2.0(28.4)\n | −8.6(16.5)\n | −15.2(4.6)\n | −20.2(−4.4)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 18.6(0.73)\n | 25.4(1.00)\n | 49.0(1.93)\n | 70.6(2.78)\n | 77.9(3.07)\n | 129.2(5.09)\n | 223.9(8.81)\n | 245.3(9.66)\n | 142.4(5.61)\n | 50.1(1.97)\n | 29.7(1.17)\n | 18.7(0.74)\n | 1,080.8(42.55)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.1 mm) | 4.5\n | 4.7\n | 7.1\n | 8.2\n | 8.8\n | 9.4\n | 13.9\n | 13.4\n | 9.3\n | 5.2\n | 5.1\n | 4.4\n | 94.0\n |\n| Average snowy days\n | 4.2\n | 2.2\n | 1.4\n | 0.1\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.5\n | 3.0\n | 11.4\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 51.4\n | 49.8\n | 49.8\n | 50.8\n | 55.8\n | 63.8\n | 71.7\n | 72.2\n | 69.3\n | 62.8\n | 58.2\n | 53.3\n | 59.1\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 195.5\n | 188.6\n | 210.8\n | 220.2\n | 232.6\n | 175.1\n | 153.0\n | 156.6\n | 164.0\n | 206.2\n | 183.9\n | 189.4\n | 2,275.9\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 62.2\n | 60.3\n | 54.7\n | 56.1\n | 52.7\n | 42.1\n | 34.1\n | 39.5\n | 43.2\n | 58.1\n | 58.3\n | 62.7\n | 50.9\n |\n| Average ultraviolet index | 2\n | 4\n | 5\n | 7\n | 9\n | 10\n | 10\n | 10\n | 8\n | 5\n | 3\n | 2\n | 6\n |\n| Source 1: Korea Meteorological Administration (percent sunshine 1981–2010)[32][33][34] |\n| Source 2: Weather Atlas (UV)[35] |\n\nThe climate of Gunwi County, which is the northern area of Daegu and was incorporated into Daegu Metropolitan City from North Gyeongsang Province in July 2023, is quite different from most parts of Daegu.

The major industries are textiles, metals and machinery. In the year 2021, Daegu had a regional GDP of $44,144 million. Many companies such as Daegu Bank, Korea Delphi, Hwasung corp., and TaeguTec are situated in this city, and Samsung and Kolon were founded here. Numerous factories are located in the industrial complexes situated in the west and north sides of the city including the Seongseo Industrial Complex, West Daegu Industrial Complex and the Daegu Dyeing Industrial Complex.\n\n\nThe city is the economic and industrial core of the Daegu-Gyeongbuk region, one of the major industrial areas in Korea. It accounted for as much as 94 percent of Korea's trade surplus in 2006.[36] The electronics industries in Gumi and the steel industries in Pohang provided great services to that surplus. World-leading manufacturing facilities for Anycall (Samsung Mobile) and POSCO's main factories are located near the city. Daegu and its neighbouring cities were designated for the Daegu-Gyeongbuk Free Economic Zone by the central government in 2008. It is specialized companies like Winitech software company in knowledge-based service and manufacturing industries.\n\n\nHistorically, Daegu has been the commercial center of the southern part of the Korean Peninsula with Seoul in the center and Pyongyang in the north (currently North Korea), because of its advantageous location. Some of the large, traditional markets like Seomun Market are still flourishing in the city.\n\n\nAdditionally, Daegu was considered the third major economic city in Korea, after Seoul and Busan. However, due to the decline of the textile industry, which is the heart of Daegu's economy, the overall economic growth of the city has also fallen.\n\n\nAlso, the city is the warmest region in South Korea due to the humid subtropical climate. This climate condition provides the region with high quality apples and oriental melons. The fruit industry is a crucial support for the local economy. Due to the stagnant economy, Daegu's population began to decrease after 2003. Recently, the local government has begun focusing on working towards economic revival and concentrating on improving the city's fashion industry.\n\n\n\n![](image)Daegu International Future Auto EXPO 2017\n![](image)Korean ICT Convergence Expo\n![](image)Korean Brain Research Center - Advanced Equipment Center\n![](image)2017 Green Energy Expo\n### Fashion industry[edit]\n\n\nBeginning in the late 1990s, Daegu has been actively making efforts to promote its fashion industry based on its textile and clothing manufacturing industries under the 'Daegu: Fashion City'. The city opens many exhibitions related to the fashion and textile industries including the Daegu Fashion Fair and Preview in Daegu annually or semi-annually, and invites national institutes. A large new town specializing in the textile-fashion industries is currently under construction in Bongmu-dong, northeastern Daegu. The district, officially named Esiapolis, takes aim at the fashion hub of East Asia. Textile complexes, textile-fashion institutions, an international school, fashion malls as well as residential areas plan to be developed in the district.[37]\n\n\n\n## Culture and sightseeing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Daegu skyline as seen from KNU's Technopark\nGenerally, Daegu is known as a conservative city. As well as being the largest inland city in the country beside Seoul it has become one of the major metropolitan areas in the nation. Traditionally, Buddhism has been strong; today there are still many temples. Confucianism is also popular in Daegu, with a large academy based in the city. Neon cross-topped spires of Christian churches can also be seen in the city.\n\n\n\n### Sights[edit]\n\n\nThe most well-known sight of the city is the stone Buddha called Gatbawi on the top of Gwanbong, Palgongsan. It is famous for its stone gat (Korean traditional hat). People from all over the country visit the place, because they believe that the Buddha will grant one's single desire.[38] Administratively, the site itself is located in the neighboring city, Gyeongsan, Gyeongbuk.\n\n\n\n![](image)Scenery of Donghwasa\nOn the outskirts of the city, mountains keep many traditional temples such as Donghwasa, Pagyesa, and Buinsa. Donghwasa is a Buddhist temple that was built by Priest Geukdal-hwasang in 493, and many artifacts of the period are found around the temple. The International Tourist Zen Meditation Center is Korea's only Zen-themed center. Some lecture halls or memorial halls such as Dodong-seowon (도동서원; 道東書院) and Nokdong-seowon (녹동서원; 鹿洞書院) are also located in the suburbs.\n\n\nOld villages have been preserved, such as the Otgol village (*Gyeongju Choi* clan's original residence area) and the Inheung village (*Nampyeong Mun'*s). In the urban area, the Joseon Dynasty's administrative or educational buildings including Gyeongsang-gamyeong (경상감영, 慶尙監營) and Daegu-hyanggyo (대구향교, 大邱鄕校) also remain. The main gateway of the city in that period called Yeongnam-jeilmun (영남제일문, 嶺南第一門, meaning the first gateway in Yeongnam), has been restored in Mangudang Park. Western style modern architecture like Gyesan Cathedral and the old building of Jeil Church are preserved across the urban area. Gyesan Cathedral is the third oldest gothic church building in Korea[39] and the cathedral of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Daegu which is one of three archdioceses in South Korea. Several buildings, in the present Keisung Academy and the KNU middle/high school, are famous too.\n\n\nYangnyeongsi (약령시, 藥令市) in Namseongno (often called Yakjeon-golmok) is the oldest market for Korean medicinal herbs in the country with a history of 350 years. Bongsan-dong which has some art galleries and studios is being developed as the artistic center of the city since the 1990s.\n\n\nNearby tourist attractions include Haeinsa—a Buddhist temple that houses the *Tripitaka Koreana* (a woodblock edition of the *Tripitaka* and one of the world's oldest extant complete collections of the Buddhist scriptures). Haeinsa is located in Gayasan National Park of Hapcheon, Gyeongnam. The historic city of Gyeongju, Gyeongbuk, the capital of the ancient kingdom of Silla is located east of Daegu.\n\n\n\n### Mountains and parks[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of parks in Daegu\n\n![](image)Dalgubeol-daejong, a city bell at the Gukchae Bosang Park\n![](image)Daegu Botanical Garden bridge\nMt. Palgong, Mt. Biseul, and Mt. Ap are the representative mountains in Daegu. Apsan, just in the southern part of the city, is the closest mountain from the urban area among them. It has many trails, Buddhist temples, a Korean War museum, and a gondola ride to the peak. Additionally, Waryongsan, Hamjisan, and Yongjibong are located in the city. These serve as neighborhood parks to the citizens. Mt. Palgong has a cable car to the summit.[40] There are also hiking trails in the direction of the Donghwasa Temple and Sutaegol Valley.\n\n\nIn the urban area, several small mountains and hills play the same role. Dalseong Park, which sits inside a 1,500-year-old earth fortress, is a historic place of the city. It contains the city's only zoo and some monuments as well as the wall. Duryu Park or Duryusan is a large forest in the middle of the urban area. It has Daegu Tower, Woobang Land, Kolon Bandstand, Duryu Stadium, and many sports facilities. Daegu Tower, also called Woobang Tower or Duryu Tower, is the tallest contemporary structure (202 m) and a symbol of the city. Its observatory commands good views of the surroundings. Woobang Land is the largest amusement park out of the capital area. Many small gardens lie in the heart of the city, such as the National Debt Repayment Movement Memorial Park (Gukchae Bosang Park) and 2·28 Park. The former park includes Dalgubeol-daejong (달구벌대종, 達句伐大鐘), which means the Dalgubeol grand bell. The bell is struck every week and year. There is also a botanical garden with a variety of plants and flowers.\n\n\n\n### Downtown and shopping[edit]\n\n\nDongseongno (동성로, 東城路) is the downtown of Daegu lying from the Daegu Station to *Jung-ang pachulso* (central police station) near the Banwoldang subway station in the center of the city Jung-gu. It has the Jung-angno subway station as the nearest station from its heart. Like its name meaning the street in the east fortress, the eastern part of Daegu-eupseong (대구읍성, 大邱邑城, means the Daegu-Principality Fortress) was situated along this street. The fortress, however, had been demolished in the early 20th century. Although Daegu is the nation's third or fourth largest city, the Dongseongno area form the largest and the broadest downtown area in the whole country except the capital city, Seoul. In most cases, famous brands open their branch shop first here out of the Greater Seoul area.[41]\n\n\n\n![](image)The sign of the Seomun Market\nSub-downtowns in the city have its own commercial powers and colors. The area around the Seongseo Industrial Complex subway station in Dalseo-gu is a concentration of many amusement spots, and young people easily can be seen around Kyungpook National University in Buk-gu. *Deuran-gil* (means the street inside the field) in Suseong-gu is known for many restaurants.\n\n\nThe city has a number of department stores. Many of these belong to national or multinational chains, but the local Daegu Department Store also operates two branches, while another local chain, Donga Department Store operates four in the city proper. The six department stores among them gather at the downtown. The traditional markets such as Seomun Market and Chilseong Market sell all sorts of goods.\n\n\n\n### Festivals[edit]\n\n\nMany traditional ceremonies and festivals in agrarian society disappeared in the process of modernization. A Confucian ritual ceremony called *Seokjeondaeje* is held at Daegu-hyanggyo every spring and autumn. The Yangnyeongsi herb medical festival and Otgol village festival are the contemporary festivals about traditional culture.\n\n\nLately in the city, enthusiasm about performing arts is growing and the local government is trying to meet its demand. Daegu International Opera Festival (DIOF) in October since 2003, Daegu International Musical Festival (DIMF), and Daegu International Bodypainting Festival (DIBF) are three of the most famous festivals on each field in Korea, although those have short histories.\n\n\nVarious festivals in various themes like the Colorful Daegu Festival, Dongseongno festival, Palgongsan maple festival, Biseulsan azalea festival, Korea in Motion Daegu, and so on, are held by the city, each ward, or the specific groups, all through the year.\n\n\nOn August 25 through August 31, 2008, Daegu hosted the first ever Asian Bodypainting Festival, a sister event of the World Bodypainting Festival in Seeboden, Austria.\n\n\nEach year the city is home to the Daegu International Jazz Festival: http://www.dijf.or.kr/\n\n\nEvery May the \"Colorful Daegu Festival\" offers performances and art programs including the Colorful Parade.[42] In July, the Daegu Chimac Festival takes place at Duryu Park in Dalseo-gu, Daegu. The term \"chimac\" is a portmanteau of chicken and maekju (meaning \"beer\"). There were over 880,000 visitors in 2015, and one million visitors during the festival in 2016.[43]\n\n\n\n### Daegu 12 Views Gallery[edit]\n\n\nThe 12 scenic spots of Daegu selected by Daegu Metropolitan City include Palgongsan Mountain, Biseulsan Mountain, Gangjeong Goryeongbo (The Ark), Sincheon, Suseongmot Lake, Dalseongtoseong Fortress, Gyeongsang Gamyeong Park, National Debt Compensation Memorial Park, Dongseongro, Seomun Market, and Daegu Stadium. \n\n\n\n* ![1st view Palgongsan](image)\n\n1st view Palgongsan\n* ![2nd view of Biseulsan](image)\n\n2nd view of Biseulsan\n* ![3rd view Gangjeong Goryeong Weir (The Arc)](image)\n\n3rd view Gangjeong Goryeong Weir (The Ark)\n* ![4 Scenic Sincheon](image)\n\n4th Scenic Sincheon\n* ![5 Scenic Spots Suseongmot Lake](image)\n\n5th Scenic Spots Suseongmot Lake\n* ![6 Scenic Dalseongtoseong Fortress](image)\n\n6th Dalseongtoseong Fortress\n* ![7 Scenic Gyeongsang Gamyeong Park](image)\n\n7th Gyeongsang Gamyeong Park\n* ![8th National Debt Compensation Memorial Park](image)\n\n8th Scenic Spots: National Debt Compensation Memorial Park\n* ![9th view Dongseongro](image)\n\n9th view Dongseongro\n* ![10th Seomun Market](image)\n\n10th Seomun Market\n* ![11th Scenery 83 Tower](image)\n\n11th Scenery 83 Tower\n* ![12th view Daegu Stadium](image)\n\n12th view Daegu Stadium\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nDaegu cuisine is similar to that consumed in the Yeongnam region. The city is known for certain unique dishes such as:\n\n\n\n* *Ttaro-gukbap*: Daegu is the only part of Korea that eats the rice and soup of gukbap separately\n* *Mungtigi*: pieces of raw beef marinated in a mixture of sesame oil, garlic, and red pepper powder\n* *Makchang*: a dish made with beef abomasum\n* *Jjimgalbi*: braised beef ribs cooked in an aluminum pot with a deep spicy, sweet, and garlicky marinade\n* *Nonmegi maeuntang*: a spicy catfish stew made with a kelp and radish stock\n* *Bogeo bulgogi*: deboned blowfish grilled with beansprouts in a spicy marinade\n* *Muchimhoe*: a salad composed of raw fish, squid, and vegetables in a sweet and spicy sauce\n* *Yaki udon*: spicy seafood noodle dish with vegetables, similar to a dry jjamppong\n* *Napjak mandu*: thin dumplings filled with small amounts of dangmyeon and vegetables\n\n\nCuisine\n* ![Ttaro-gukbap](image)\n\nTtaro-gukbap\n* ![Mungtigi](image)\n\nMungtigi\n* ![Jjimgalbi](image)\n\nJjimgalbi\n* ![Nonmegi maeuntang](image)\n\nNonmegi maeuntang\n* ![Bogeo bulgogi](image)\n\nBogeo bulgogi\n* ![Nureun guksu](image)\n\nNureun guksu\n* ![Yaki udon](image)\n\nYaki udon\n* ![Napjak mandu](image)\n\nNapjak mandu\n\n### Museums[edit]\n\n\n* Daegu Art Museum\n\n\n![](image)Daegu Art Museum\n* Daegu National Museum – A notable national museum collecting relics excavated in and around Daegu\n* Daegu Bangjja Yugi (Korean Bronzeware) Museum\n* Hengso Museum of Keimyung University\n* Korea Video Museum\n* Kyungpook National University Museum\n* Museum for Daegu National University of Education\n* Museum of Natural Dye Arts\n* National Debt Repayment Movement Memorial Museum\n\n\n### Theaters[edit]\n\n\n* Daegu Opera House – The first theater in Korea only for performing opera\n* Suseong Artpia\n* Keimyung Art Center Archived 2013-08-27 at the Wayback Machine – One of the largest scale theaters in the city.\n* Daegu Culture and Arts Center\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nOn March 27, 2007, the city was selected to host the 2011 World Championships in Athletics. Daegu competed with cities such as Moscow, Russia, and Brisbane, Australia, to earn the votes of the IAAF Council. The event was the fourth IAAF World Championships in Athletics to be held outside Europe, and the first games in mainland Asia. It was also the third worldwide sports event held in Korea after the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul and 2002 FIFA World Cup in Korea and Japan, in which Daegu hosted four matches. It also hosted the 2003 Summer Universiade.[6] The city hosts the Colorful Daegu Pre-Championships Meeting every year since 2005.\n\n\nDaegu Stadium is the second largest sports complex in South Korea with a seating capacity of 66,422. Daegu Civic Stadium hosted some football matches at the 1988 Summer Olympics.\n\n\nThe Daegu Marathon is held here every year in April. The race begins and ends at the Daegu Stadium.\n\n\n\n#### Sports teams[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Club\n | Sport\n | League\n | Venue\n | Established\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Samsung Lions | Baseball\n | KBO League | Daegu Samsung Lions Park | 1982\n |\n| Daegu FC | Football\n | K League 1 | DGB Daegu Bank Park | 2003\n |\n| Daegu KOGAS Pegasus | Basketball\n | Korean Basketball League | Daegu Gymnasium\n | 1994\n |\n\n\n##### Samsung Lions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A home stadium of the Samsung Lions, one of the most popular sports teams in the city\nThe Samsung Lions are a professional baseball team founded in 1982. They are based in the southeastern city of Daegu and are members of the KBO League. Their home stadium is Daegu Samsung Lions Park. They have won the Korean Series eight times. The Samsung Lions are the first team to win four consecutive Korean Series titles (2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014). They are also the first Korean team to win a regular league title for five consecutive years (2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015).\n\n\n\n##### Daegu FC[edit]\n\n\n![](image)DGB Daegu Bank Park\nDaegu Football Club was founded as a community club at the end of 2002, and made their K League debut in 2003. Historically, Daegu have often placed in the lower reaches of the K League. Their best season to date has been 2021, when they finished third out of twelve teams. They were also the winners of the Korean FA Cup in 2018, which qualified the club for their first appearance in the AFC Champions League the following year. The club has since played in the 2021 and 2022 editions of AFC Champions League.\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nThere are three terrestrial TV broadcasting stations in the city: KBS Daegu Broadcast Station, Daegu MBC, and TBC. These are affiliated companies of central broadcasting stations in Seoul just like other local broadcasting companies in South Korea. TBC (Taegu Broadcasting Corporation) depends on SBS. They cover to Gyeongsangbuk-do out of the city. Each television broadcasting company has its own radio station as well.\n\n\n\n### International Daegu[edit]\n\n\nDaegu is largely a homogeneous community that includes few non-Koreans. However, a number of immigrants from South and Southeast Asia work in automotive-parts factories on the city's west side. In addition, there is a small group of English-speaking Westerners working in English schools and university programs. The American military bases are also home to several hundred Americans. Recently Chinese students have begun studying Korean at universities in Daegu, and there is an increasing number of graduate and post-graduate students from other Asian countries. As elsewhere in Korea, Korean food overwhelmingly dominates; Chinese, Japanese and Western food forms the bulk of non-Korean food but recently Indian and Russian foods have become available.\n\n\nDaegu hosts three American military bases, Camp Henry, Camp George which houses Daegu American School, and Camp Walker. Camp Walker houses Daegu High School for high school children, while Camp George hold the school for elementary and middle school (both of which are primarily for children of military personnel and US Military civilian employees). Camp George also houses most of the married [Enlisted] ranked soldiers. Camp Henry and Camp Walker serve as the primary place of work for all the military personnel. Camp Walker serves as the home to enlisted Sergeants Major and Officer ranked soldiers, Major and up. Although non-military families can enroll their children at the school, most either home-school their children or send them to a small Christian private school which teaches about 25 children near the central business district of Daegu.\n\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nReligion in Daegu (2015)[44]\n\n\n\nNot religious (55.8%)\nBuddhism (23.8%)\nProtestantism (12%)\nCatholicism (7.7%)\nOther (0.7%)\n\nAccording to the census of 2015, 23.8% of the population followed Buddhism and 19.7% followed Christianity (12% Protestantism and 7.7% Catholicism). 55.8% of the population is irreligious.[44]\n\n\n**Mosque Controversy** In December 2020, construction of a mosque in Daehyeon-dong for a Muslim community of 80-150 members comprising mainly staff and students of a local university, resulted in opposition from nearby residents who complained about the change in land use without prior consultation.[45][1] Construction was halted in 2021 by the district administrative office (having originally been approved by the same office) after residents voiced concerns. This suspension was later judged by The National Human Rights Commission of Korea (NHRCK) to be based on discrimination and prejudice against Muslims. Insulting and offensive messages, considered by the NHRCK as akin to hate-speech, and the heads of pigs displayed within glass-fronted refrigerators, were subsequently left near the mosque construction site; the identity and precise motive of the culprits remain uncertain.[46] Due to proximity to the mosque and its being seen as an intentional insult to Islam and the Muslim community, local residents were strongly criticized for holding a social barbeque/picnic in their neighbourhood in which pork (the most frequently eaten red meat in South Korea) was served. The approval for change of land use within a residential area without consultation with local residents indicates a failure by the local district office to adequately support both communities, and of the authorities to mediate effective communication between the two groups. Notably, the Muslim community did not disseminate information to the local residents on its plans, despite local awareness of Muslim worship within a house on the site since 2014, and general acceptance of what some residents saw as night-time disturbance during the time of Ramadan.[47] Since the dispute began however, dialogue between the local residents and the Muslim community has been hampered by third parties in Korea, according to the Muslim community spokesperson.[46] As of May 2023, construction was underway; differences had not been resolved.[46]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Education in South Korea\n\nAs of 2021[update], Daegu has 232 elementary schools, 125 middle schools, and 94 high schools.[48] There are two specialized public high schools which are Daegu Science High School and Taegu Foreign Language High School, and some other high schools such as Keisung Academy, Gyeongsin High School and Daeryun High School have good grades for university admission. Most of the well-known high schools are located in Suseong-gu because its educational grade and zeal are high standard in the country.\n\n\nAlso, Daegu has 4 independent private high schools like **Keisung Academy** (also called Keisung High School), Gyeongsin High School, **Gyeong-il Girl's High School**, **Daegun Catholic High School**.\n\n\n\n### Universities and colleges[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kyungpook National University, School of Medicine\n![](image)Keimyung University, main building\nDaegu and its satellite towns are one of the areas which have the largest private higher educational institutions in Korea. Many of their main campuses are located in the nearby Gyeongsan city which serves the Daegu region as a college town. Kyungpook National University (KNU) is one of the most highly ranked and well organized national universities in Korea. It holds high ranks in and around the city in many academic fields, while DGIST(Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology) is recognized as one of Korea's top universities in the field of science and technology. DGIST is one of four ISTs in Korea, along with KAIST, UNIST and GIST. It was established under 'The Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology Act (Act 699)' enacted on December 11, 2003. In 2019, DGIST was selected as 'Top 25 Rising Young Universities'.[49] Daegu has two of the most prestigious private universities outside Seoul, Yeungnam University (YU) and Keimyung University. There are some smaller private universities such as Catholic University of Daegu and Daegu University. Daegu National University of Education offers elementary education training.\n\n\nThe other universities and colleges include Daegu Arts University, Daegu Cyber University, Daegu Haany University, Daegu Health College, Daegu Mirae College, Daegu Polytechnic College, Daegu Technical College, Daeshin University, Keimyung University, Kyongbuk Science College, Kyungil University, Taekyeung College, Yeungjin College, Yeungnam College of Science and Technology, and Youngnam Theological College and Seminary.\n\n\n\n#### Medical institutions[edit]\n\n\nSome large university hospitals make the city the medical hub of south-eastern Korea. The Kyungpook National University Hospital, founded as *Daegu-dongin-uiwon* in 1907 by the Japanese, is the best-known hospital in the city. The Dongsan Hospital (attached to Keimyung University), founded as *Jejungwon* in 1899, is one of the oldest western style medical clinics in Korea. The Yeungnam University Medical Center has the largest number of beds in the city. The yearly treatment amount of these tertiary hospitals is the second largest in South Korea after that of Seoul.[50] The Daegu Catholic University Medical Center is also included in them.\n\n\n\n### Primary and secondary schools[edit]\n\n\n* Hamji High School\n* Kangbuk High School\n* Maecheon High School\n* Seongsan High School\n\n\nInternational schools in Daegu include:\n\n\n\n* Daegu International School[51]\n* Daegu Chinese Elementary School or Korea Daeguhwagyo Elementary School (한국대구화교초등학교)[52]\n* Overseas Chinese High School, Daegu\n\n\n### Elementary schools[edit]\n\n\nGlobal schools:\n\n\n\n* Daegu Sindang Elementary School\n\n\nDaegu Sindang Elementary School is a public elementary school located in Dalseo-gu, Daegu. The school's motto is \"To raise children who are upright, wise, and strong\", and its emblem and flower are the magnolia and pine tree, respectively. Daegu Sindang Elementary School has a history of excellence in sports, music and academics, and has won numerous awards in these fields. It is also a designated school for creative education and a leading school for after-school programmes. In 2020, a group of students from Daegu Sindang Elementary School won first place in the Korean National Championship of the FIRST LEGO League (FLL) robotics competition.[53]\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\n### Rail[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Dongdaegu Station\nDaegu is the hub of the Korean inland railroad traffic. The main railroad of the country, Gyeongbu Line passes through the city. The largest railroad station in the city, Dongdaegu Station, has the second largest passenger traffic in Korea after Seoul Station, it is the number one station in Korea for train stops, and the largest train traffic.[54] All trains passing through Dongdaegu Station make a mandatory stop. The station re-opened in 2004 after extensive renovations serving the KTX highspeed train, Saemaul and Mugunghwa trains. All kinds of trains except KTX depart from Daegu Station, an all-new building with cinemas, restaurants and a department store, located near the city centre. It has the tenth largest passenger traffic in Korea.[54] Daegu Line branches off from Gacheon station of Gyeongbu Line.\n\n\n\n### Metro[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Daegu Metro\n\n![](image)Map of the rapid transit of Daegu. The red line is line 1, and the green is line 2.\nThe city also has a metro system, consisting of two heavy rail lines. Line 1 crosses the city from northeast to southwest, while Line 2 crosses from west to east. Line 3 from northwest to southeast is an elevated monorail. All the lines are and will be operated by the Daegu Metropolitan Transit Corporation (DTRO). Another line will operate in a few years as a heavy rail system using the Gumi–Daegu–Gyeongsan section of Gyeongbu Line. Line 4 is a long-range plan and will be a circle line. Fare is 1400 won and 1250 won with a prepaid card. There is a free interchange scheme between the metro and bus within an hour of first use for the prepaid card users.\n\n\nIt started a full-fledged health-sharing stairway project by installing \"Seven-color melody health donation stairs\" at Shinmae Station and Imdang Station on Daegu Subway Line 2. Using these stairs, LED lights turn on with the sound of the keyboard. And a donation of ₩10(won) per session goes to those in need (such as pediatric cancer centers and low-income families).[55]\n\n\n\n### Road[edit]\n\n\nThere are two types of buses which are local and limited express. Limited express buses have more seats, but often passengers are required to stand. As of 2020[update], Local bus fare costs around 1,400 won with cash, Limited express bus fare would set you back 1,800 won. Discounted fare is available with a prepaid card.[56]\n\n\nBus route numbers are made up with 3 digits, each number indicates the area that bus serves. For example, number 407 bus runs from zone four, to zone zero, and then to zone seven. Other routes, usually circular, are named for the districts they serve and numbered 1 through 3.\n\n\nTraffic is sometimes heavy, however, the major thoroughfares handle fairly high volumes of traffic without too much trouble.\n\n\n\n![](image)Daegu International Airport\n### Air[edit]\n\n\nDaegu is served by Daegu International Airport, located in northeastern Daegu. As of July, 2022, international destinations include China, Thailand, the Philippines, and Mongolia.\n\n\n\n### Bus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n* Daegu Buses [ko]\n\n\n## Others[edit]\n\n\n### Accidents[edit]\n\n\n* The Frog Boys, this incident is an unsolved case. 5 boys were killed by the criminal in 1991. Boys failed to return after going out to pick up the salamander eggs, and people often call the case \"The frog boys case\".\n* The 1995 Daegu gas explosions killed 101 and injured 202. A pagoda for consolation of the dead was erected in Haksan park.\n* The Daegu subway fire occurred on February 18, 2003, when an arsonist, \"Kim Dae-Han\" set fire to a train at the Jungangno Station of the Daegu Metropolitan Subway in Daegu, South Korea.

The broader Seoul metropolitan area, encompassing Gyeonggi province and Incheon metropolitan city, emerged as the world's fourth largest metropolitan economy in 2014, trailing only Tokyo, New York City, and Los Angeles, hosting more than half of South Korea's population. Although Seoul's population peaked at slightly over 10 million, it has gradually decreased since 2014, standing at approximately 9.97 million residents as of 2020. Seoul is the seat of the Korean government.\n\n\nSeoul's history traces back to 18 BC when it was founded by the people of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. During the Joseon dynasty, Seoul was officially designated as the capital, surrounded by the Fortress Wall of Seoul. In the early 20th century, Seoul was occupied by the Japanese Empire, temporarily renamed \"Gyeongseong.\" The Korean War brought fierce battles, with Seoul changing hands four times and leaving the city mostly in ruins. Nevertheless, the city has since undergone significant reconstruction and rapid urbanization.\n\n\nSeoul was rated Asia's most livable city, with the second-highest quality of life globally according to Arcadis in 2015 and a GDP per capita (PPP) of approximately $40,000. 15 *Fortune* Global 500 companies, including industry giants such as Samsung,[9] LG, and Hyundai, are headquartered in the Seoul Capital Area, which has major technology hubs, such as Gangnam and Digital Media City,[10]. Seoul is ranked seventh in the Global Power City Index and the Global Financial Centres Index, and is one of the five leading hosts of global conferences.[11] The city has also hosted major events such as the 1986 Asian Games, the 1988 Summer Olympics, and the 2010 G20 Seoul summit.\n\n\nSeoul is geographically set in a mountainous and hilly terrain, with Bukhan Mountain positioned on its northern edge. Within the Seoul Capital Area lie five UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Changdeok Palace, Hwaseong Fortress, Jongmyo Shrine, Namhansanseong, and the Royal Tombs of the Joseon dynasty.[12] Furthermore, Seoul has witnessed a surge in modern architectural development, with iconic landmarks including the N Seoul Tower, the 63 Building, the Lotte World Tower, the Dongdaemun Design Plaza, Lotte World, the Trade Tower, COEX, IFC Seoul, and Parc1. Seoul was named the World Design Capital in 2010 and has served as the national hub for the music, entertainment, and cultural industries that have propelled K-pop and the Korean Wave to international prominence.\n\n\n\n\n## Toponomy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Names of Seoul\n\nThe city has been known in the past by the names Wiryeseong (위례성; 慰禮城, during the Baekje era), Bukhansangun (북한산군; 北漢山郡 during the Goguryeo era), Namcheon (남천; 南川,[13] during the Silla era), Hanyang (한양; 漢陽, during the Northern and Southern States period), Namgyeong(남경; 南京, during Goryeo era), Hanseong (한성; 漢城, during the Joseon era), and Keijō (京城) or Gyeongseong (경성; 京城) during Japanese rule.[14]\n\n\nDuring Japan's annexation of Korea, *Hanseong* (漢城) was renamed *Keijō* (京城) by the Imperial authorities to prevent confusion with the Hanja '漢' (a transliteration of an ancient Korean word *Han* (한) meaning \"great\"), which also refers to Han people or the Han dynasty in Chinese and in Japanese is a term for \"China\".[15]\n\n\nAfter World War II and the liberation of Korea, the city took its present name, which originated from the Korean word meaning \"capital city\", which is believed to have descended from an ancient word, *Seorabeol* (서라벌; 徐羅伐), which originally referred to Gyeongju, the capital of Silla.[16] Ancient Gyeongju was also known in documents by the Chinese-style name *Geumseong* (金城, literally \"Gold Castle or City\" or \"Metal Castle or City\"), but it is unclear whether the native Korean-style name *Seorabeol* had the same meaning as *Geumseong*.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nUnlike most place names in Korea, \"Seoul\" has no corresponding Hanja (Chinese characters used in the Korean language). On 18 January 2005, the Seoul government changed its official name in Chinese characters from the historic *Hancheng* (simplified Chinese: 汉城; traditional Chinese: 漢城; pinyin: *Hànchéng*) to *Shou'er* (首尔; 首爾; *Shǒu'ěr*).[17][18]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Seoul\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Seoul.\n![](image)The Fortress Wall of Seoul\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\nSettlement of the Han River area, where present-day Seoul is located, began around 4000 BC.[19]\n\n\nSeoul is first recorded as Wiryeseong, the capital of Baekje (founded in 18 BC) in the northeastern area of modern Seoul.[19] There are several city walls remaining in the area that date from this time. Pungnaptoseong, an earthen wall located southeast Seoul, is widely believed to have been at the main Wiryeseong site.[20] As the Three Kingdoms competed for this strategic region, control passed from Baekje to Goguryeo in the 5th century.[21]\n\n\nHowever, according to Samguk Sagi, both Baekje and Silla described the land as frontier border of Baekje, not as the capital region.[22][23] Moreover, Jinheung Taewang Stele found at current day Bukhansan tells that the place was underdeveloped as of 6th century AD,[13] suggesting that the first capital Wiryeseong was not located in or nearby Seoul.\n\n\nIn July or August 553, Silla took the control of the region from Baekje, and the city became a part of newly established Sin Province (신주; 新州).[22][23] Sin (新) has both meaning of \"New\" and \"Silla\", thus literally means New Silla Province.\n\n\nIn November 555, Jinheung Taewang made royal visit to Bukhansan, and inspected the borderline.[24] In 557, Silla abolished Sin Province, and established Bukhansan Province (북한산주; 北漢山州).[25] The word Hanseong (한성; 漢城; lit. Han Fortress) appears on the stone wall of \"Pyongyang Fortress\", which was presumably built in the mid to late 6th century AD over period of 42 years, located in Pyongyang, while there is no evidence that Seoul had name Hanseong dating the three kingdoms and earlier period.[26][27][28][29][30]\n\n\nIn 568, Jinheung Taewang made another royal visit to the northern border, visited Hanseong, and stayed in Namcheon on his way back to the capital. During his stay, he set Jinheung Taewang Stele, abolished Bukhansan Province, and established Namcheon Province (남천주; 南川州; South River Province), appointing the city as the provincial capital.[13][31] Based on the naming system, the actual name of Han River during this time was likely Namcheon (Nam River) itself or should have the word ending with \"cheon\" (천; 川) not \"gang\" (강; 江) nor \"su\" (수; 水). In addition, \"Bukhansan\" Jinheung Stele clearly states that Silla had possession of Hanseong (modern day Pyongyang), thus Bukhansan has to be located north of Hanseong. Modern day Pyongyang was not Pyongyang, Taedong River was likely Han River, and Bukhansan was not Bukhansan during the three kingdoms period.[13][32] Moreover, Pyongyang was a common noun meaning capital used by Goguryeo and Goryeo dynasties, similar to Seoul.[33]\n\n\nIn 603, Goguryeo attacked Bukhansanseong (북한산성; 北漢山城; Bukhan Mountain Fortress), which Silla ended up winning.[34][35] In 604, Silla abolished Namcheon Province, and reestablished Bukhansan Province in order to strengthen the northern border. The city lost its provincial capital position and was put under Bukhansan Province once again.[36] This further proves that Bukhansan was located in the North of modern-day Pyongyang as changing the provincial name and objective would not be required if Bukhansan was located within Seoul.\n\n\nIn the 11th century Goryeo, which succeeded Unified Silla, built a summer palace in Seoul, which was referred to as the \"Southern Capital\". It was only from this period that Seoul became a larger settlement.[19]\n\n\n\n### Joseon[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of Seoul created 1825–1835 by Kim Jeong-ho and designated National Treasure no 853.\nWhen Joseon replaced Goryeo, the capital was moved to Seoul (also known as Hanyang or Hanseong), where it remained until the fall of the dynasty. The Gyeongbok Palace, built in the 14th century, served as the royal residence until 1592. The other large palace, Changdeokgung, constructed in 1405, served as the main royal palace from 1611 to 1872.[19] After Joseon changed its name to the Korean Empire in 1897, Hwangseong also designated Seoul.[*clarification needed*]\n\n\nOriginally, the city was entirely surrounded by a massive circular stone wall to provide its citizens security from wild animals, thieves and attacks. The city has grown beyond those walls and although the wall no longer stands (except along Bugaksan Mountain (북악산; 北岳山), north of the downtown area[37]), the gates remain near the downtown district of Seoul, including most notably Sungnyemun (commonly known as Namdaemun) and Heunginjimun (commonly known as Dongdaemun).[38] During the Joseon dynasty, the gates were opened and closed each day, accompanied by the ringing of large bells at the Bosingak belfry.[39] In the late 19th century, after hundreds of years of isolation, Seoul opened its gates to foreigners and began to modernize. Seoul became the first city in East Asia to introduce electricity in the royal palace, built by the Edison Illuminating Company[40] and a decade later Seoul also implemented electrical street lights.[41]\n\n\nMuch of the development was due to trade with foreign countries like France and the United States. For example, the Seoul Electric Company, Seoul Electric Trolley Company, and Seoul Fresh Spring Water Company were all joint Korean–U.S. owned enterprises.[42] In 1904, an American by the name of Angus Hamilton visited the city and said, \"The streets of Seoul are magnificent, spacious, clean, admirably made and well-drained. The narrow, dirty lanes have been widened, gutters have been covered, roadways broadened. Seoul is within measurable distance of becoming the highest, most interesting and cleanest city in the East.\"[43]\n\n\n\n### Japanese annexation of Korea[edit]\n\n\nAfter the annexation treaty in 1910, Japan annexed Korea and renamed the city Gyeongseong (\"Kyongsong\" in Korean and \"Keijo\" in Japanese). Japanese technology was imported, the city walls were removed, some of the gates demolished. Roads became paved and Western-style buildings were constructed. The city was liberated by U.S. forces at the end of World War II.[19]\n\n\n\n### Contemporary history[edit]\n\n\nIn 1945, the city was officially named Seoul, and was designated as a special city in 1949.[19]\n\n\nDuring the Korean War, Seoul changed hands between the Soviet/Chinese-backed North Korean forces and the American-backed South Korean forces four times: falling to the North Koreans in the June 1950 First Battle of Seoul, recaptured by UN forces in the September 1950 Second Battle of Seoul, falling to a combined Chinese/North Korean force in the January 1951 Third Battle of Seoul, and finally being recaptured once more by UN forces in Operation Ripper during the spring of 1951.[44][45] The extensive fighting left the city heavily damaged after the war. The capital was temporarily relocated to Busan.[19] One estimate of the extensive damage states that after the war, at least 191,000 buildings, 55,000 houses, and 1,000 factories lay in ruins. In addition, a flood of refugees had entered Seoul during the war, swelling the population of the city and its metropolitan area to an estimated 1.5 million by 1955.[46]\n\n\nFollowing the war, Seoul began to focus on reconstruction and modernization. As South Korea's economy started to grow rapidly from the 1960s, urbanization also accelerated and workers began to move to Seoul and other larger cities.[46] From the 1970s, the size of Seoul administrative area greatly expanded as it annexed a number of towns and villages from several surrounding counties.[47]\n\n\nUntil 1972, Seoul was claimed by North Korea as its *de jure* capital, being specified as such in Article 103 of the 1948 North Korean constitution.[48]\n\n\nSouth Korea's 2019 population was estimated at 51.71 million, and according to the 2018 Population and Housing Census, 49.8% of the population resided in the Seoul metropolitan area. This was up by 0.7% from 49.1% in 2010, showing a distinct trend toward the concentration of the population in the capital.[49] Seoul has become the economic, political and cultural hub of the country,[19] with several Fortune Global 500 companies, including Samsung, SK Holdings, Hyundai, POSCO and LG Group headquartered there.[50]\n\n\nSeoul was the host city of the 1986 Asian Games and 1988 Summer Olympics as well as one of the venues of the 2002 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\n\nVarious views of Seoul from the 63 Building in July, 2019\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Han River at sunrise\nSeoul is in the northwest of South Korea. Seoul proper comprises 605.25 km2 (233.69 sq mi),[3] with a radius of approximately 15 km (9 mi), roughly bisected into northern and southern halves by the Han River. The river is no longer actively used for navigation, because its estuary is located at the borders of the two Koreas, with civilian entry barred. There are four main mountains in central Seoul: Bugaksan, Inwangsan, Naksan and Namsan. The Seoul Fortress Wall, which historically bounded the city, goes over these mountains. The city is bordered by eight mountains, as well as the more level lands of the Han River plain and western areas.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Seoul\n\n\n\n|  Seoul\n |\n| --- |\n| Climate chart (explanation) |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 17\n\n\n\n2\n\n−6\n | 28\n\n\n\n5\n\n−3\n | 37\n\n\n\n11\n\n2\n | 73\n\n\n\n18\n\n8\n | 104\n\n\n\n24\n\n14\n | 130\n\n\n\n28\n\n19\n | 414\n\n\n\n29\n\n22\n | 348\n\n\n\n30\n\n23\n | 142\n\n\n\n26\n\n18\n | 52\n\n\n\n20\n\n11\n | 51\n\n\n\n12\n\n4\n | 23\n\n\n\n4\n\n−3\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °C |\n| █ Precipitation totals in mm |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Imperial conversion |\n| --- |\n| J | F | M | A | M | J | J | A | S | O | N | D |\n| 0.7\n\n\n\n36\n\n22\n | 1.1\n\n\n\n41\n\n26\n | 1.5\n\n\n\n52\n\n35\n | 2.9\n\n\n\n64\n\n46\n | 4.1\n\n\n\n74\n\n56\n | 5.1\n\n\n\n82\n\n66\n | 16\n\n\n\n84\n\n72\n | 14\n\n\n\n86\n\n73\n | 5.6\n\n\n\n79\n\n64\n | 2.1\n\n\n\n68\n\n51\n | 2\n\n\n\n53\n\n38\n | 0.9\n\n\n\n40\n\n26\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °F |\n| █ Precipitation totals in inches |\n\n |\n\n\nSeoul has a humid continental (Köppen: *Dwa*) or humid subtropical climate (*Cwa*, by −3 °C or 26.6 °F isotherm), influenced by the monsoons; there is great variation in temperature and precipitation throughout the year.[51][52] The suburbs of Seoul are generally cooler than the center of Seoul because of the urban heat island effect.[53] Summers are hot and humid, with the East Asian monsoon taking place from June until September. August, the hottest month, has average high and low temperatures of 30.0 and 22.9 °C (86 and 73 °F) with higher temperatures possible. Heat index values can surpass 40 °C (104.0 °F) at the height of summer. \nWinters are usually cold to freezing with average January high and low temperatures of 2.1 and −5.5 °C (35.8 and 22.1 °F), and are generally much drier than summers, with an average of 24.9 days of snow annually. Sometimes, temperatures drop dramatically to below −10 °C (14 °F), and on some occasions as low as −15 °C (5 °F) in the mid winter period of January and February. Temperatures below −20 °C (−4 °F) have been recorded.\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Seoul (1991–2020 normals, extremes 1907–present)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 14.4(57.9)\n | 18.7(65.7)\n | 25.1(77.2)\n | 29.8(85.6)\n | 34.4(93.9)\n | 37.2(99.0)\n | 38.4(101.1)\n | 39.6(103.3)\n | 35.1(95.2)\n | 30.1(86.2)\n | 25.9(78.6)\n | 17.7(63.9)\n | 39.6(103.3)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 2.1(35.8)\n | 5.1(41.2)\n | 11.0(51.8)\n | 17.9(64.2)\n | 23.6(74.5)\n | 27.6(81.7)\n | 29.0(84.2)\n | 30.0(86.0)\n | 26.2(79.2)\n | 20.2(68.4)\n | 11.9(53.4)\n | 4.2(39.6)\n | 17.4(63.3)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | −2.0(28.4)\n | 0.7(33.3)\n | 6.1(43.0)\n | 12.6(54.7)\n | 18.2(64.8)\n | 22.7(72.9)\n | 25.3(77.5)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n | 21.7(71.1)\n | 15.0(59.0)\n | 7.5(45.5)\n | 0.2(32.4)\n | 12.8(55.0)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | −5.5(22.1)\n | −3.2(26.2)\n | 1.9(35.4)\n | 8.0(46.4)\n | 13.5(56.3)\n | 18.7(65.7)\n | 22.3(72.1)\n | 22.9(73.2)\n | 17.7(63.9)\n | 10.6(51.1)\n | 3.5(38.3)\n | −3.4(25.9)\n | 8.9(48.0)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −22.5(−8.5)\n | −19.6(−3.3)\n | −14.1(6.6)\n | −4.3(24.3)\n | 2.4(36.3)\n | 8.8(47.8)\n | 12.9(55.2)\n | 13.5(56.3)\n | 3.2(37.8)\n | −5.1(22.8)\n | −11.9(10.6)\n | −23.1(−9.6)\n | −23.1(−9.6)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 16.8(0.66)\n | 28.2(1.11)\n | 36.9(1.45)\n | 72.9(2.87)\n | 103.6(4.08)\n | 129.5(5.10)\n | 414.4(16.31)\n | 348.2(13.71)\n | 141.5(5.57)\n | 52.2(2.06)\n | 51.1(2.01)\n | 22.6(0.89)\n | 1,417.9(55.82)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.1 mm) | 6.1\n | 5.8\n | 7.0\n | 8.4\n | 8.6\n | 9.9\n | 16.3\n | 14.7\n | 9.1\n | 6.1\n | 8.8\n | 7.8\n | 108.6\n |\n| Average snowy days\n | 7.1\n | 5.1\n | 2.8\n | 0.2\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 2.3\n | 6.4\n | 23.9\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 56.2\n | 54.6\n | 54.6\n | 54.8\n | 59.7\n | 65.7\n | 76.2\n | 73.5\n | 66.4\n | 61.8\n | 60.4\n | 57.8\n | 61.8\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 169.6\n | 170.8\n | 198.2\n | 206.3\n | 223.0\n | 189.1\n | 123.6\n | 156.1\n | 179.7\n | 206.5\n | 157.3\n | 162.9\n | 2,143.1\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 52.3\n | 53.6\n | 51.0\n | 51.9\n | 48.4\n | 41.2\n | 26.8\n | 36.2\n | 47.2\n | 57.1\n | 50.2\n | 51.1\n | 46.4\n |\n| Average ultraviolet index | 2\n | 3\n | 5\n | 7\n | 8\n | 9\n | 10\n | 9\n | 7\n | 4\n | 3\n | 2\n | 6\n |\n| Source 1: Korea Meteorological Administration (percent sunshine 1981–2010)[54][55][56] |\n| Source 2: Weather Atlas (UV),[57] Meteo Climat (record highs and lows)[58] |\n\n### Air quality[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Air pollution in South Korea\n\n![](image)Very Unhealthy\n Unhealthy\n Unhealthy for sensitive groups\nModerate\n Good\nAccording to the Environmental Performance Index 2016, South Korea ranked 173rd out of 180 countries in terms of air quality. More than 50 percent of the populations in South Korea are exposed to dangerous levels of fine dust.[59][60]\nAir pollution is a major issue in Seoul.[61][62][63][64] According to the 2016 World Health Organization Global Urban Ambient Air Pollution Database,[65] the annual average PM2.5 concentration in 2014 was 24 micrograms per cubic meter (1.0×10−5 gr/cu ft), which is 2.4 times higher than that recommended by the WHO Air Quality Guidelines[66] for the annual mean PM2.5. The Seoul Metropolitan Government monitors and publicly shares real-time air quality data.[67]\n\n\nSince the early 1960s, the Ministry of Environment has implemented a range of policies and air pollutant standards to improve and manage air quality for its people.[68] The \"Special Act on the Improvement of Air Quality in the Seoul Metropolitan Area\" was passed in December 2003. Its 1st Seoul Metropolitan Air Quality Improvement Plan (2005–2014) focused on improving the concentrations of PM10 and nitrogen dioxide by reducing emissions.[69] As a result, the annual average PM10 concentrations decreased from 70.0 μg/m3 in 2001 to 44.4 μg/m3 in 2011[70] and 46 μg/m3 in 2014.[65] As of 2014, the annual average PM10 concentration was still at least twice than that recommended by the WHO Air Quality Guidelines.[66] The 2nd Seoul Metropolitan Air Quality Improvement Plan (2015–2024) added PM2.5 and ozone to its list of managed pollutants.[71]\n\n\nAsian dust, emissions from Seoul and in general from the rest of South Korea, as well as emissions from China, all contribute to Seoul's air quality.[62][72] A partnership between researchers in South Korea and the United States is conducting an international air quality field study in Korea (KORUS-AQ) to determine how much each source contributes.[73][*needs update*]\n\n\nBesides air quality, greenhouse gas emissions represent hot issues in South Korea since the country is among top-10 strongest emitters in the world. Seoul is the strongest hotspot of greenhouse gas emissions in the country and according to satellite data, the persistent carbon dioxide anomaly over the city is one of the strongest in the world.[74]\n\n\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Seoul Metropolitan Government\n\n![](image)Seoul City Hall\nThe Seoul Metropolitan Government is the local government for Seoul, and is responsible for the administration and provision of various services to the city, including correctional institutions, education, libraries, public safety, recreational facilities, sanitation, water supply, and welfare services. It is headed by a mayor and three vice mayors, and is divided into 25 autonomous districts and 522 administrative neighborhoods.[75][76]\n\n\n\n## Administrative districts[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of districts of Seoul\n\n![](image)Districts of Seoul\nSeoul is divided into 25 gu (구; 區) (district).[77] The *gu* vary greatly in area (from 10 to 47 km2 or 3.9 to 18.1 sq mi) and population (from fewer than 140,000 to 630,000). Songpa has the most people, while Seocho has the largest area. The government of each gu handles many of the functions that are handled by city governments in other jurisdictions. Each *gu* is divided into \"*dong*\" (동; 洞) or neighborhoods. Some gu have only a few dong while others like Jongno District have a very large number of distinct neighborhoods. Gu of Seoul consist of 423 administrative dongs (행정동) in total.[77] *Dong* are also sub-divided into 13,787 *tong* (통; 統), which are further divided into 102,796 *ban* in total.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Seoul population pyramid in 2022\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% p.a. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1950 | 1,021,000 | —     |\n| 1960 | 2,361,000 | +8.74% |\n| 1970 | 5,312,000 | +8.45% |\n| 1980 | 8,244,000 | +4.49% |\n| 1990 | 10,518,000 | +2.47% |\n| 2000 | 9,879,000 | −0.62% |\n| 2010 | 9,796,000 | −0.08% |\n| 2020 | 9,963,000 | +0.17% |\n| source:[78] |\n\n\nSeoul proper is noted for its population density, which is almost twice that of New York City and eight times greater than Rome. Its metropolitan area was the most densely populated among OECD countries in Asia in 2012, and second worldwide after that of Paris.[79] As of 2015, the population was 9.86 million,[80] in 2012, it was 10.44 million. As of 2021, the population is 9.59 million.[81][82] As of the end of June 2011, 10.29 million Republic of Korea citizens lived in the city. This was a 0.24% decrease from the end of 2010. The population of Seoul has been dropping since the early 1990s, the reasons being the high costs of living, urban sprawling to Gyeonggi region's satellite bed cities and an aging population.[80]\n\n\nAs of 2016, the number of foreigners living in Seoul was 404,037, 22.9% of the total foreign population in South Korea.[83] As of June 2011, 186,631 foreigners were Chinese citizens of Korean ancestry. This was an 8.84% increase from the end of 2010 and a 12.85% increase from June 2010. The next largest group was Chinese citizens who are not of Korean ethnicity; 29,901 of them resided in Seoul. The next highest group consisted of the 9,999 United States citizens who were not of Korean ancestry. The next highest group were Taiwanese citizens, at 8,717.[84]\n\n\nThe two major religions in Seoul are Christianity and Buddhism. Other religions include Muism (indigenous religion) and Confucianism. Seoul is home to one of the world's largest Christian congregations, Yoido Full Gospel Church, which has around 830,000 members.[85] According to the 2015 census, 10.8% of the population follows Buddhism and 35% follows Christianity (24.3% Protestantism and 10.7% Catholicism). 53.6% of the population is irreligious.[86]\n\n\n\nReligion in Seoul (2015)[86]\n\n\n\nNot religious (53.6%)\nProtestantism (24.3%)\nBuddhism (10.8%)\nCatholicism (10.7%)\nOther (0.6%)\n\nSeoul is home to the world's largest modern university founded by a Buddhist Order, Dongguk University.[87] Native Seoulites tend to speak the Gyeonggi dialect of Korean.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Economy of South Korea\n\n![](image)Gangnam Commercial Area\nSeoul is the business and financial hub of South Korea. Although it accounts for only 0.6 percent of the nation's land area, 48.3 percent of South Korea's bank deposits were held in Seoul in 2003,[88] and the city generated 23 percent of the country's GDP overall in 2012.[89] In 2008 the Worldwide Centers of Commerce Index ranked Seoul No.9.[90] The Global Financial Centres Index in 2015 listed Seoul as the 6th financially most competitive city in the world.[91] The Economist Intelligence Unit ranked Seoul 15th in the list of \"Overall 2025 City Competitiveness\" regarding future competitiveness of cities.[92]\n\n\n\n### Manufacturing[edit]\n\n\nThe traditional, labor-intensive manufacturing industries have been continuously replaced by information technology, electronics and assembly-type of industries;[93][94] however, food and beverage production, as well as printing and publishing remained among the core industries.[93] Major manufacturers are headquartered in the city, including Samsung, LG, Hyundai, Kia and SK. Notable food and beverage companies include Jinro, whose soju is the most sold alcoholic drink in the world, beating out Smirnoff vodka;[95] top selling beer producers Hite (merged with Jinro) and Oriental Brewery.[96] It also hosts food giants like Seoul Dairy Cooperative, Nongshim Group, Ottogi, CJ, Orion, Maeil Holdings, Namyang Dairy Products and Lotte.\n\n\n\n### Finance[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Yeouido, the main financial district of Seoul\nSeoul hosts large concentration of headquarters of International companies and banks, including 15 companies on Fortune 500 list such as Samsung, LG and Hyundai.[97] Most bank headquarters and the Korea Exchange are located in Yeouido (Yeoui island),[93] which is often called \"South Korea's Wall Street\" and has been serving as the financial center of the city since the 1980s.[98] The Seoul international finance center & SIFC MALL, Hanhwa 63 building, the Hanhwa insurance company head office. Hanhwa is one of the three largest South Korean insurance companies, along with Samsung Life and Gangnam & Kyobo life insurance group.\n\n\n\n### Commerce[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Shopping in Seoul\n\n![](image)Myeong-dong is one of the most popular destinations in Seoul.\nThe largest wholesale and retail market in South Korea, the Dongdaemun Market, is located in Seoul.[99] Myeongdong is a shopping and entertainment area in downtown Seoul with mid- to high-end stores, fashion boutiques and international brand outlets.[100] The nearby Namdaemun Market, named after the Namdaemun Gate, is the oldest continually running market in Seoul.[101]\n\n\nInsadong is the cultural art market of Seoul, where traditional and modern Korean artworks, such as paintings, sculptures and calligraphy are sold.[102] Hwanghak-dong Flea Market and Janganpyeong Antique Market also offer antique products.[103][104] Some shops for local designers have opened in Samcheong-dong, where numerous small art galleries are located. While Itaewon had catered mainly to foreign tourists and American soldiers based in the city, Koreans now comprise the majority of visitors to the area.[105] The Gangnam district is one of the most affluent areas in Seoul[105] and is noted for the fashionable and upscale Apgujeong-dong and Cheongdam-dong areas and the COEX Mall. Wholesale markets include Noryangjin Fisheries Wholesale Market and Garak Market.\n\n\nThe Yongsan Electronics Market is the largest electronics market in Asia. Electronics markets are Gangbyeon station metro line 2 Techno mart, ENTER6 MALL & Shindorim station Technomart mall complex.[106] Times Square is one of Seoul's largest shopping malls, and contains the world's largest permanent 35 mm cinema screen, the CGV Starium.[107]\n\n\nKorea World Trade Center Complex, which comprises COEX mall, congress center, 3 Inter-continental hotels, Business tower (Asem tower), Residence hotel, Casino and City airport terminal was established in 1988 in time for the Seoul Olympics. The 2nd World trade trade center is being planned at Seoul Olympic stadium complex as MICE HUB by Seoul city. Ex-Kepco head office building was purchased by Hyundai motor group with 9billion USD to build 115-storey Hyundai GBC & hotel complex until 2021. Now ex-kepco 25-storey building is under demolition.\n\n\n\n### Technology[edit]\n\n\nSeoul has been described as the world's \"most wired city\",[108] ranked first in technology readiness by PwC's *Cities of Opportunity* report.[109] Seoul has a very technologically advanced infrastructure.[110][111]\n\n\nSeoul is among the world leaders in Internet connectivity, being the capital of South Korea, which has the world's highest fiber-optic broadband penetration and highest global average internet speeds of 26.1 Mbit/s.[112][113] Since 2015, Seoul has provided free Wi-Fi access in outdoor spaces through a 47.7 billion won ($44 million) project with Internet access at 10,430 parks, streets and other public places.[114] Internet speeds in some apartment buildings reach up to 52.5Gbit/s with assistance from Nokia, and though the average standard consists of 100 Mbit/s services, providers nationwide are rapidly rolling out 1Gbit/s connections at the equivalent of US$20 per month.[115] In addition, the city is served by the KTX high-speed rail and the Seoul Subway, which provides 4G LTE, Wi-Fi, and DMB inside subway cars. 5G will be introduced commercially in March 2019 in Seoul.\n\n\n\n## Architecture[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Architecture of South Korea\n\n![](image)Bukchon Hanok Village, a traditional Seoul village built during the Joseon era\nThe traditional heart of Seoul is the old Joseon dynasty city, now the downtown area, where most palaces, government offices, corporate headquarters, hotels, and traditional markets are located. Cheonggyecheon, a stream that runs from west to east through the valley before emptying into the Han River, was for many years covered with concrete, but was recently restored by an urban revival project in 2005.[116] Jongno street, meaning \"Bell Street\", has been a principal street and one of the earliest commercial streets of the city,[117][118] on which one can find Bosingak, a pavilion containing a large bell. The bell signaled the different times of the day and controlled the four major gates to the city. North of downtown is Bukhan Mountain, and to the south is the smaller Namsan. Further south are the old suburbs, Yongsan District and Mapo District. Across the Han River are the newer and wealthier areas of Gangnam District, Seocho District and surrounding neighborhoods.\n\n\n\n### Historical architecture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sungnyemun (commonly known as Namdaemun)\nSeoul has many historical and cultural landmarks. In Amsa-dong Prehistoric Settlement Site, Gangdong District, neolithic remains were excavated and accidentally discovered by a flood in 1925.[119]\n\n\nUrban and civil planning was a key concept when Seoul was first designed to serve as a capital in the late 14th century. The Joseon dynasty built the \"Five Grand Palaces\" in Seoul—Changdeokgung, Changgyeonggung, Deoksugung, Gyeongbokgung and Gyeonghuigung—all of which are located in the Jongno and Jung Districts. Among them, Changdeokgung was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1997 as an \"outstanding example of Far Eastern palace architecture and garden design\". The main palace, Gyeongbokgung, underwent a large-scale restoration project.[120] The palaces are considered exemplary architecture of the Joseon period. Beside the palaces, Unhyeongung is known for being the royal residence of Regent Daewongun, the father of Emperor Gojong at the end of the Joseon Dynasty.\n\n\nSeoul has been surrounded by walls that were built to regulate visitors from other regions and protect the city in case of an invasion. Pungnap Toseong is a flat earthen wall built at the edge of the Han River, which is widely believed to be the site of Wiryeseong. Mongchon Toseong is another earthen wall built during the Baekje period that is now located inside the Olympic Park.[20] The Fortress Wall of Seoul was built early in the Joseon dynasty for protection of the city. After many centuries of destruction and rebuilding, about 2⁄3 of the wall remains, as well as six of the original eight gates. These gates include the south gate Namdaemun and the east gate Dongdaemun. Namdaemun was the oldest wooden gate until a 2008 arson attack, and was re-opened after complete restoration in 2013.[121] Located near the gates are the traditional markets and largest shopping center, Namdaemun Market and Dongdaemun Market.\n\n\n\n### Modern architecture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lotte World Tower\nVarious high-rise office buildings and residential buildings, like the Gangnam Finance Center, the Tower Palace, Namsan Seoul Tower, and the Lotte World Tower, dominate the city's skyline. The tallest building is Lotte World Tower, reaching a height of 555m. It opened to the public in April 2017. It is also the 6th highest building in the world.\n\n\nThe World Trade Center Seoul, located in Gangnam District, hosts various expositions and conferences. Also in Gangnam District is the COEX Mall, a large indoor shopping and entertainment complex. Downstream from Gangnam District is Yeouido, an island that is home to the National Assembly, major broadcasting studios, and a number of large office buildings, as well as the Korea Finance Building and the Yoido Full Gospel Church. The Olympic Stadium, Olympic Park, and Lotte World are located in Songpa District, on the south side of the Han River, upstream from Gangnam District. Three new modern landmarks of Seoul are Dongdaemun Design Plaza & Park, designed by Zaha Hadid, the new wave-shaped Seoul City Hall, by Yoo Kerl of iArc, and the Lotte World Tower, the 6th tallest building in the world designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox.\n\n\nIn 2010 Seoul was designated the World Design Capital for the year.[122]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n### Museums[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of museums in Seoul\n\n![](image)The National Museum of Korea\n![](image)The War Memorial of Korea\nSeoul is home to 115 museums,[123] including four national and nine official municipal museums.

Its system dates back to the era of the Korean Empire, when the first streetcar lines were laid and a railroad linking Seoul and Incheon was completed.[135] Seoul's most important streetcar line ran along Jongno until it was replaced by Line 1 of the subway system in the early 1970s. Other notable streets in downtown Seoul include Euljiro, Teheranno, Sejongno, Chungmuro, Yulgongno, and Toegyero. There are nine major subway lines stretching for more than 250 km (155 mi), with one additional line planned. As of 2010[update], 25% of the population has a commute time of an hour or longer.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Bus[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Seoul Buses\n\n![](image)Seoul buses\nSeoul's bus system is operated by the Seoul Metropolitan Government (S.M.G.), with four primary bus configurations available servicing most of the city. Seoul has many large intercity/express bus terminals. These buses connect Seoul with cities throughout South Korea. The Seoul Express Bus Terminal, Central City Terminal and Seoul Nambu Terminal are located in the district of Seocho District. In addition, East Seoul Bus Terminal in Gwangjin District and Sangbong Terminal in Jungnang District handles traffics mainly from Gangwon and Chungcheong provinces.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Urban rail[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Seoul Station\nMain article: Seoul Metropolitan Subway\n\nSeoul has a comprehensive urban railway network of 21 rapid transit, light metro and commuter lines that interconnects every district of the city and the surrounding areas of Incheon, Gyeonggi province, western Gangwon province, and northern Chungnam province. With more than 8 million passengers per day, the subway is one of the busiest subway systems in the world and the largest in the world, with a total track length of 940 km (580 mi). In addition, in order to cope with the various modes of transport, Seoul's metropolitan government employs several mathematicians to coordinate the subway, bus, and traffic schedules into one timetable. The various lines are run by Korail, Seoul Metro, NeoTrans Co. Ltd., AREX, and Seoul Metro Line 9 Corporation.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Train[edit]\n\n\n![](image)KTX Sancheon\nSeoul is connected to every major city in South Korea by rail. Most major South Korean cities are linked via the KTX high-speed train, which has a normal operation speed of more than 300 km/h (186 mph). The Mugunghwa and Saemaeul trains also stop at all major stations. Major railroad stations include:[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n* Seoul Station, Yongsan District: Gyeongbu line (KTX/ITX-Saemaeul/Nuriro/Mugunghwa-ho)\n* Yongsan station, Yongsan District: Honam line (KTX/ITX-Saemaeul/Nuriro/Mugunghwa), Jeolla/Janghang lines (Saemaul/Mugunghwa)\n* Yeongdeungpo station, Yeongdeungpo District: Gyeongbu/Honam/Janghang lines (KTX/ITX-Saemaeul/Saemaul/Nuriro/Mugunghwa)\n* Cheongnyangni station, Dongdaemun District: Gyeongchun/Jungang/Yeongdong/Taebaek lines (ITX-Cheongchun/ITX-Saemaeul/Mugunghwa)\n* Suseo station (HSR), Gangnam District: Suseo HSR (SRT)\n\n\n### Airports[edit]\n\n\nSeoul is served by two international airports, Incheon International Airport and Gimpo International Airport.\n\n\nGimpo International Airport opened in 1939 as an airfield for the Japanese Imperial Army and opened for civil aircraft in 1957. Since the opening of Incheon International, Gimpo International handles domestic flights along with some short haul international flights to Tokyo Haneda, Osaka Kansai, Taipei Songshan, Shanghai Hongqiao, and Beijing Capital although flights to Osaka Kansai and Beijing Capital also operate from Incheon International.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIncheon International Airport opened in March 2001 in Yeongjong island. It is now responsible for major international flights. Incheon International Airport is Asia's eighth busiest airport in terms of passengers, the world's fourth busiest airport by cargo traffic, and the world's eighth busiest airport in terms of international passengers in 2014. In 2016, 57,765,397 passengers used the airport. Incheon International Airport opened terminal 2 on 18 January 2018.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIncheon and Gimpo are linked to Seoul by expressway, and to each other by the AREX to Seoul Station. Intercity bus services are available to various destinations around the country.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Cycling[edit]\n\n\nCycling is becoming increasingly popular in Seoul and in the entire country. Both banks of the Han River have cycling paths that run all the way across the city along the river. In addition, Seoul introduced in 2015 a bicycle-sharing system named Ddareungi (and named Seoul Bike in English).[136]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Education in South Korea and List of universities in Seoul\n\n### Universities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Entrance of Seoul National University\nSeoul is home to the majority of South Korea's most prestigious universities, including Seoul National University, Yonsei University, Korea University.\n\n\nSeoul ranked 2nd on the QS Best Student Cities 2023.[137]\n\n\n\n### Secondary education[edit]\n\n\nCompulsory education lasts from grade 1–9 (six years of elementary school and 3 years of middle school).[138] Students spend six years in elementary school, three years in middle school, and three years in high school. Secondary schools generally require students to wear uniforms. There is an exit exam for graduating from high school and many students proceeding to the university level are required to take the College Scholastic Ability Test that is held every November.

The broader Seoul metropolitan area, encompassing Gyeonggi province and Incheon metropolitan city, emerged as the world's fourth largest metropolitan economy in 2014, trailing only Tokyo, New York City, and Los Angeles, hosting more than half of South Korea's population. Although Seoul's population peaked at slightly over 10 million, it has gradually decreased since 2014, standing at approximately 9.97 million residents as of 2020. Seoul is the seat of the Korean government.\n\n\nSeoul's history traces back to 18 BC when it was founded by the people of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. During the Joseon dynasty, Seoul was officially designated as the capital, surrounded by the Fortress Wall of Seoul. In the early 20th century, Seoul was occupied by the Japanese Empire, temporarily renamed \"Gyeongseong.\" The Korean War brought fierce battles, with Seoul changing hands four times and leaving the city mostly in ruins. Nevertheless, the city has since undergone significant reconstruction and rapid urbanization.\n\n\nSeoul was rated Asia's most livable city, with the second-highest quality of life globally according to Arcadis in 2015 and a GDP per capita (PPP) of approximately $40,000. 15 *Fortune* Global 500 companies, including industry giants such as Samsung,[9] LG, and Hyundai, are headquartered in the Seoul Capital Area, which has major technology hubs, such as Gangnam and Digital Media City,[10]. Seoul is ranked seventh in the Global Power City Index and the Global Financial Centres Index, and is one of the five leading hosts of global conferences.[11] The city has also hosted major events such as the 1986 Asian Games, the 1988 Summer Olympics, and the 2010 G20 Seoul summit.\n\n\nSeoul is geographically set in a mountainous and hilly terrain, with Bukhan Mountain positioned on its northern edge. Within the Seoul Capital Area lie five UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Changdeok Palace, Hwaseong Fortress, Jongmyo Shrine, Namhansanseong, and the Royal Tombs of the Joseon dynasty.[12] Furthermore, Seoul has witnessed a surge in modern architectural development, with iconic landmarks including the N Seoul Tower, the 63 Building, the Lotte World Tower, the Dongdaemun Design Plaza, Lotte World, the Trade Tower, COEX, IFC Seoul, and Parc1. Seoul was named the World Design Capital in 2010 and has served as the national hub for the music, entertainment, and cultural industries that have propelled K-pop and the Korean Wave to international prominence.\n\n\n\n\n## Toponomy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Names of Seoul\n\nThe city has been known in the past by the names Wiryeseong (위례성; 慰禮城, during the Baekje era), Bukhansangun (북한산군; 北漢山郡 during the Goguryeo era), Namcheon (남천; 南川,[13] during the Silla era), Hanyang (한양; 漢陽, during the Northern and Southern States period), Namgyeong(남경; 南京, during Goryeo era), Hanseong (한성; 漢城, during the Joseon era), and Keijō (京城) or Gyeongseong (경성; 京城) during Japanese rule.[14]\n\n\nDuring Japan's annexation of Korea, *Hanseong* (漢城) was renamed *Keijō* (京城) by the Imperial authorities to prevent confusion with the Hanja '漢' (a transliteration of an ancient Korean word *Han* (한) meaning \"great\"), which also refers to Han people or the Han dynasty in Chinese and in Japanese is a term for \"China\".[15]\n\n\nAfter World War II and the liberation of Korea, the city took its present name, which originated from the Korean word meaning \"capital city\", which is believed to have descended from an ancient word, *Seorabeol* (서라벌; 徐羅伐), which originally referred to Gyeongju, the capital of Silla.[16] Ancient Gyeongju was also known in documents by the Chinese-style name *Geumseong* (金城, literally \"Gold Castle or City\" or \"Metal Castle or City\"), but it is unclear whether the native Korean-style name *Seorabeol* had the same meaning as *Geumseong*.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nUnlike most place names in Korea, \"Seoul\" has no corresponding Hanja (Chinese characters used in the Korean language). On 18 January 2005, the Seoul government changed its official name in Chinese characters from the historic *Hancheng* (simplified Chinese: 汉城; traditional Chinese: 漢城; pinyin: *Hànchéng*) to *Shou'er* (首尔; 首爾; *Shǒu'ěr*).[17][18]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Seoul\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Seoul.\n![](image)The Fortress Wall of Seoul\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\nSettlement of the Han River area, where present-day Seoul is located, began around 4000 BC.[19]\n\n\nSeoul is first recorded as Wiryeseong, the capital of Baekje (founded in 18 BC) in the northeastern area of modern Seoul.[19] There are several city walls remaining in the area that date from this time. Pungnaptoseong, an earthen wall located southeast Seoul, is widely believed to have been at the main Wiryeseong site.[20] As the Three Kingdoms competed for this strategic region, control passed from Baekje to Goguryeo in the 5th century.[21]\n\n\nHowever, according to Samguk Sagi, both Baekje and Silla described the land as frontier border of Baekje, not as the capital region.[22][23] Moreover, Jinheung Taewang Stele found at current day Bukhansan tells that the place was underdeveloped as of 6th century AD,[13] suggesting that the first capital Wiryeseong was not located in or nearby Seoul.\n\n\nIn July or August 553, Silla took the control of the region from Baekje, and the city became a part of newly established Sin Province (신주; 新州).[22][23] Sin (新) has both meaning of \"New\" and \"Silla\", thus literally means New Silla Province.\n\n\nIn November 555, Jinheung Taewang made royal visit to Bukhansan, and inspected the borderline.[24] In 557, Silla abolished Sin Province, and established Bukhansan Province (북한산주; 北漢山州).[25] The word Hanseong (한성; 漢城; lit. Han Fortress) appears on the stone wall of \"Pyongyang Fortress\", which was presumably built in the mid to late 6th century AD over period of 42 years, located in Pyongyang, while there is no evidence that Seoul had name Hanseong dating the three kingdoms and earlier period.[26][27][28][29][30]\n\n\nIn 568, Jinheung Taewang made another royal visit to the northern border, visited Hanseong, and stayed in Namcheon on his way back to the capital. During his stay, he set Jinheung Taewang Stele, abolished Bukhansan Province, and established Namcheon Province (남천주; 南川州; South River Province), appointing the city as the provincial capital.[13][31] Based on the naming system, the actual name of Han River during this time was likely Namcheon (Nam River) itself or should have the word ending with \"cheon\" (천; 川) not \"gang\" (강; 江) nor \"su\" (수; 水). In addition, \"Bukhansan\" Jinheung Stele clearly states that Silla had possession of Hanseong (modern day Pyongyang), thus Bukhansan has to be located north of Hanseong. Modern day Pyongyang was not Pyongyang, Taedong River was likely Han River, and Bukhansan was not Bukhansan during the three kingdoms period.[13][32] Moreover, Pyongyang was a common noun meaning capital used by Goguryeo and Goryeo dynasties, similar to Seoul.[33]\n\n\nIn 603, Goguryeo attacked Bukhansanseong (북한산성; 北漢山城; Bukhan Mountain Fortress), which Silla ended up winning.[34][35] In 604, Silla abolished Namcheon Province, and reestablished Bukhansan Province in order to strengthen the northern border. The city lost its provincial capital position and was put under Bukhansan Province once again.[36] This further proves that Bukhansan was located in the North of modern-day Pyongyang as changing the provincial name and objective would not be required if Bukhansan was located within Seoul.\n\n\nIn the 11th century Goryeo, which succeeded Unified Silla, built a summer palace in Seoul, which was referred to as the \"Southern Capital\". It was only from this period that Seoul became a larger settlement.[19]\n\n\n\n### Joseon[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of Seoul created 1825–1835 by Kim Jeong-ho and designated National Treasure no 853.\nWhen Joseon replaced Goryeo, the capital was moved to Seoul (also known as Hanyang or Hanseong), where it remained until the fall of the dynasty. The Gyeongbok Palace, built in the 14th century, served as the royal residence until 1592. The other large palace, Changdeokgung, constructed in 1405, served as the main royal palace from 1611 to 1872.[19] After Joseon changed its name to the Korean Empire in 1897, Hwangseong also designated Seoul.[*clarification needed*]\n\n\nOriginally, the city was entirely surrounded by a massive circular stone wall to provide its citizens security from wild animals, thieves and attacks. The city has grown beyond those walls and although the wall no longer stands (except along Bugaksan Mountain (북악산; 北岳山), north of the downtown area[37]), the gates remain near the downtown district of Seoul, including most notably Sungnyemun (commonly known as Namdaemun) and Heunginjimun (commonly known as Dongdaemun).[38] During the Joseon dynasty, the gates were opened and closed each day, accompanied by the ringing of large bells at the Bosingak belfry.[39] In the late 19th century, after hundreds of years of isolation, Seoul opened its gates to foreigners and began to modernize. Seoul became the first city in East Asia to introduce electricity in the royal palace, built by the Edison Illuminating Company[40] and a decade later Seoul also implemented electrical street lights.[41]\n\n\nMuch of the development was due to trade with foreign countries like France and the United States. For example, the Seoul Electric Company, Seoul Electric Trolley Company, and Seoul Fresh Spring Water Company were all joint Korean–U.S. owned enterprises.[42] In 1904, an American by the name of Angus Hamilton visited the city and said, \"The streets of Seoul are magnificent, spacious, clean, admirably made and well-drained. The narrow, dirty lanes have been widened, gutters have been covered, roadways broadened. Seoul is within measurable distance of becoming the highest, most interesting and cleanest city in the East.\"[43]\n\n\n\n### Japanese annexation of Korea[edit]\n\n\nAfter the annexation treaty in 1910, Japan annexed Korea and renamed the city Gyeongseong (\"Kyongsong\" in Korean and \"Keijo\" in Japanese). Japanese technology was imported, the city walls were removed, some of the gates demolished. Roads became paved and Western-style buildings were constructed. The city was liberated by U.S. forces at the end of World War II.[19]\n\n\n\n### Contemporary history[edit]\n\n\nIn 1945, the city was officially named Seoul, and was designated as a special city in 1949.[19]\n\n\nDuring the Korean War, Seoul changed hands between the Soviet/Chinese-backed North Korean forces and the American-backed South Korean forces four times: falling to the North Koreans in the June 1950 First Battle of Seoul, recaptured by UN forces in the September 1950 Second Battle of Seoul, falling to a combined Chinese/North Korean force in the January 1951 Third Battle of Seoul, and finally being recaptured once more by UN forces in Operation Ripper during the spring of 1951.[44][45] The extensive fighting left the city heavily damaged after the war. The capital was temporarily relocated to Busan.[19] One estimate of the extensive damage states that after the war, at least 191,000 buildings, 55,000 houses, and 1,000 factories lay in ruins. In addition, a flood of refugees had entered Seoul during the war, swelling the population of the city and its metropolitan area to an estimated 1.5 million by 1955.[46]\n\n\nFollowing the war, Seoul began to focus on reconstruction and modernization. As South Korea's economy started to grow rapidly from the 1960s, urbanization also accelerated and workers began to move to Seoul and other larger cities.[46] From the 1970s, the size of Seoul administrative area greatly expanded as it annexed a number of towns and villages from several surrounding counties.[47]\n\n\nUntil 1972, Seoul was claimed by North Korea as its *de jure* capital, being specified as such in Article 103 of the 1948 North Korean constitution.[48]\n\n\nSouth Korea's 2019 population was estimated at 51.71 million, and according to the 2018 Population and Housing Census, 49.8% of the population resided in the Seoul metropolitan area. This was up by 0.7% from 49.1% in 2010, showing a distinct trend toward the concentration of the population in the capital.[49] Seoul has become the economic, political and cultural hub of the country,[19] with several Fortune Global 500 companies, including Samsung, SK Holdings, Hyundai, POSCO and LG Group headquartered there.[50]\n\n\nSeoul was the host city of the 1986 Asian Games and 1988 Summer Olympics as well as one of the venues of the 2002 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\n\nVarious views of Seoul from the 63 Building in July, 2019\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Han River at sunrise\nSeoul is in the northwest of South Korea. Seoul proper comprises 605.25 km2 (233.69 sq mi),[3] with a radius of approximately 15 km (9 mi), roughly bisected into northern and southern halves by the Han River. The river is no longer actively used for navigation, because its estuary is located at the borders of the two Koreas, with civilian entry barred. There are four main mountains in central Seoul: Bugaksan, Inwangsan, Naksan and Namsan. The Seoul Fortress Wall, which historically bounded the city, goes over these mountains. The city is bordered by eight mountains, as well as the more level lands of the Han River plain and western areas.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Seoul\n\n\n\n|  Seoul\n |\n| --- |\n| Climate chart (explanation) |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 17\n\n\n\n2\n\n−6\n | 28\n\n\n\n5\n\n−3\n | 37\n\n\n\n11\n\n2\n | 73\n\n\n\n18\n\n8\n | 104\n\n\n\n24\n\n14\n | 130\n\n\n\n28\n\n19\n | 414\n\n\n\n29\n\n22\n | 348\n\n\n\n30\n\n23\n | 142\n\n\n\n26\n\n18\n | 52\n\n\n\n20\n\n11\n | 51\n\n\n\n12\n\n4\n | 23\n\n\n\n4\n\n−3\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °C |\n| █ Precipitation totals in mm |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Imperial conversion |\n| --- |\n| J | F | M | A | M | J | J | A | S | O | N | D |\n| 0.7\n\n\n\n36\n\n22\n | 1.1\n\n\n\n41\n\n26\n | 1.5\n\n\n\n52\n\n35\n | 2.9\n\n\n\n64\n\n46\n | 4.1\n\n\n\n74\n\n56\n | 5.1\n\n\n\n82\n\n66\n | 16\n\n\n\n84\n\n72\n | 14\n\n\n\n86\n\n73\n | 5.6\n\n\n\n79\n\n64\n | 2.1\n\n\n\n68\n\n51\n | 2\n\n\n\n53\n\n38\n | 0.9\n\n\n\n40\n\n26\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °F |\n| █ Precipitation totals in inches |\n\n |\n\n\nSeoul has a humid continental (Köppen: *Dwa*) or humid subtropical climate (*Cwa*, by −3 °C or 26.6 °F isotherm), influenced by the monsoons; there is great variation in temperature and precipitation throughout the year.[51][52] The suburbs of Seoul are generally cooler than the center of Seoul because of the urban heat island effect.[53] Summers are hot and humid, with the East Asian monsoon taking place from June until September. August, the hottest month, has average high and low temperatures of 30.0 and 22.9 °C (86 and 73 °F) with higher temperatures possible. Heat index values can surpass 40 °C (104.0 °F) at the height of summer. \nWinters are usually cold to freezing with average January high and low temperatures of 2.1 and −5.5 °C (35.8 and 22.1 °F), and are generally much drier than summers, with an average of 24.9 days of snow annually. Sometimes, temperatures drop dramatically to below −10 °C (14 °F), and on some occasions as low as −15 °C (5 °F) in the mid winter period of January and February.

More than 50 percent of the populations in South Korea are exposed to dangerous levels of fine dust.[59][60]\nAir pollution is a major issue in Seoul.[61][62][63][64] According to the 2016 World Health Organization Global Urban Ambient Air Pollution Database,[65] the annual average PM2.5 concentration in 2014 was 24 micrograms per cubic meter (1.0×10−5 gr/cu ft), which is 2.4 times higher than that recommended by the WHO Air Quality Guidelines[66] for the annual mean PM2.5. The Seoul Metropolitan Government monitors and publicly shares real-time air quality data.[67]\n\n\nSince the early 1960s, the Ministry of Environment has implemented a range of policies and air pollutant standards to improve and manage air quality for its people.[68] The \"Special Act on the Improvement of Air Quality in the Seoul Metropolitan Area\" was passed in December 2003. Its 1st Seoul Metropolitan Air Quality Improvement Plan (2005–2014) focused on improving the concentrations of PM10 and nitrogen dioxide by reducing emissions.[69] As a result, the annual average PM10 concentrations decreased from 70.0 μg/m3 in 2001 to 44.4 μg/m3 in 2011[70] and 46 μg/m3 in 2014.[65] As of 2014, the annual average PM10 concentration was still at least twice than that recommended by the WHO Air Quality Guidelines.[66] The 2nd Seoul Metropolitan Air Quality Improvement Plan (2015–2024) added PM2.5 and ozone to its list of managed pollutants.[71]\n\n\nAsian dust, emissions from Seoul and in general from the rest of South Korea, as well as emissions from China, all contribute to Seoul's air quality.[62][72] A partnership between researchers in South Korea and the United States is conducting an international air quality field study in Korea (KORUS-AQ) to determine how much each source contributes.[73][*needs update*]\n\n\nBesides air quality, greenhouse gas emissions represent hot issues in South Korea since the country is among top-10 strongest emitters in the world. Seoul is the strongest hotspot of greenhouse gas emissions in the country and according to satellite data, the persistent carbon dioxide anomaly over the city is one of the strongest in the world.[74]\n\n\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Seoul Metropolitan Government\n\n![](image)Seoul City Hall\nThe Seoul Metropolitan Government is the local government for Seoul, and is responsible for the administration and provision of various services to the city, including correctional institutions, education, libraries, public safety, recreational facilities, sanitation, water supply, and welfare services. It is headed by a mayor and three vice mayors, and is divided into 25 autonomous districts and 522 administrative neighborhoods.[75][76]\n\n\n\n## Administrative districts[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of districts of Seoul\n\n![](image)Districts of Seoul\nSeoul is divided into 25 gu (구; 區) (district).[77] The *gu* vary greatly in area (from 10 to 47 km2 or 3.9 to 18.1 sq mi) and population (from fewer than 140,000 to 630,000). Songpa has the most people, while Seocho has the largest area. The government of each gu handles many of the functions that are handled by city governments in other jurisdictions. Each *gu* is divided into \"*dong*\" (동; 洞) or neighborhoods. Some gu have only a few dong while others like Jongno District have a very large number of distinct neighborhoods. Gu of Seoul consist of 423 administrative dongs (행정동) in total.[77] *Dong* are also sub-divided into 13,787 *tong* (통; 統), which are further divided into 102,796 *ban* in total.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Seoul population pyramid in 2022\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% p.a. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1950 | 1,021,000 | —     |\n| 1960 | 2,361,000 | +8.74% |\n| 1970 | 5,312,000 | +8.45% |\n| 1980 | 8,244,000 | +4.49% |\n| 1990 | 10,518,000 | +2.47% |\n| 2000 | 9,879,000 | −0.62% |\n| 2010 | 9,796,000 | −0.08% |\n| 2020 | 9,963,000 | +0.17% |\n| source:[78] |\n\n\nSeoul proper is noted for its population density, which is almost twice that of New York City and eight times greater than Rome. Its metropolitan area was the most densely populated among OECD countries in Asia in 2012, and second worldwide after that of Paris.[79] As of 2015, the population was 9.86 million,[80] in 2012, it was 10.44 million. As of 2021, the population is 9.59 million.[81][82] As of the end of June 2011, 10.29 million Republic of Korea citizens lived in the city. This was a 0.24% decrease from the end of 2010. The population of Seoul has been dropping since the early 1990s, the reasons being the high costs of living, urban sprawling to Gyeonggi region's satellite bed cities and an aging population.[80]\n\n\nAs of 2016, the number of foreigners living in Seoul was 404,037, 22.9% of the total foreign population in South Korea.[83] As of June 2011, 186,631 foreigners were Chinese citizens of Korean ancestry. This was an 8.84% increase from the end of 2010 and a 12.85% increase from June 2010. The next largest group was Chinese citizens who are not of Korean ethnicity; 29,901 of them resided in Seoul. The next highest group consisted of the 9,999 United States citizens who were not of Korean ancestry. The next highest group were Taiwanese citizens, at 8,717.[84]\n\n\nThe two major religions in Seoul are Christianity and Buddhism. Other religions include Muism (indigenous religion) and Confucianism. Seoul is home to one of the world's largest Christian congregations, Yoido Full Gospel Church, which has around 830,000 members.[85] According to the 2015 census, 10.8% of the population follows Buddhism and 35% follows Christianity (24.3% Protestantism and 10.7% Catholicism). 53.6% of the population is irreligious.[86]\n\n\n\nReligion in Seoul (2015)[86]\n\n\n\nNot religious (53.6%)\nProtestantism (24.3%)\nBuddhism (10.8%)\nCatholicism (10.7%)\nOther (0.6%)\n\nSeoul is home to the world's largest modern university founded by a Buddhist Order, Dongguk University.[87] Native Seoulites tend to speak the Gyeonggi dialect of Korean.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Economy of South Korea\n\n![](image)Gangnam Commercial Area\nSeoul is the business and financial hub of South Korea. Although it accounts for only 0.6 percent of the nation's land area, 48.3 percent of South Korea's bank deposits were held in Seoul in 2003,[88] and the city generated 23 percent of the country's GDP overall in 2012.[89] In 2008 the Worldwide Centers of Commerce Index ranked Seoul No.9.[90] The Global Financial Centres Index in 2015 listed Seoul as the 6th financially most competitive city in the world.[91] The Economist Intelligence Unit ranked Seoul 15th in the list of \"Overall 2025 City Competitiveness\" regarding future competitiveness of cities.[92]\n\n\n\n### Manufacturing[edit]\n\n\nThe traditional, labor-intensive manufacturing industries have been continuously replaced by information technology, electronics and assembly-type of industries;[93][94] however, food and beverage production, as well as printing and publishing remained among the core industries.[93] Major manufacturers are headquartered in the city, including Samsung, LG, Hyundai, Kia and SK. Notable food and beverage companies include Jinro, whose soju is the most sold alcoholic drink in the world, beating out Smirnoff vodka;[95] top selling beer producers Hite (merged with Jinro) and Oriental Brewery.[96] It also hosts food giants like Seoul Dairy Cooperative, Nongshim Group, Ottogi, CJ, Orion, Maeil Holdings, Namyang Dairy Products and Lotte.\n\n\n\n### Finance[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Yeouido, the main financial district of Seoul\nSeoul hosts large concentration of headquarters of International companies and banks, including 15 companies on Fortune 500 list such as Samsung, LG and Hyundai.[97] Most bank headquarters and the Korea Exchange are located in Yeouido (Yeoui island),[93] which is often called \"South Korea's Wall Street\" and has been serving as the financial center of the city since the 1980s.[98] The Seoul international finance center & SIFC MALL, Hanhwa 63 building, the Hanhwa insurance company head office. Hanhwa is one of the three largest South Korean insurance companies, along with Samsung Life and Gangnam & Kyobo life insurance group.\n\n\n\n### Commerce[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Shopping in Seoul\n\n![](image)Myeong-dong is one of the most popular destinations in Seoul.\nThe largest wholesale and retail market in South Korea, the Dongdaemun Market, is located in Seoul.[99] Myeongdong is a shopping and entertainment area in downtown Seoul with mid- to high-end stores, fashion boutiques and international brand outlets.[100] The nearby Namdaemun Market, named after the Namdaemun Gate, is the oldest continually running market in Seoul.[101]\n\n\nInsadong is the cultural art market of Seoul, where traditional and modern Korean artworks, such as paintings, sculptures and calligraphy are sold.[102] Hwanghak-dong Flea Market and Janganpyeong Antique Market also offer antique products.[103][104] Some shops for local designers have opened in Samcheong-dong, where numerous small art galleries are located. While Itaewon had catered mainly to foreign tourists and American soldiers based in the city, Koreans now comprise the majority of visitors to the area.[105] The Gangnam district is one of the most affluent areas in Seoul[105] and is noted for the fashionable and upscale Apgujeong-dong and Cheongdam-dong areas and the COEX Mall. Wholesale markets include Noryangjin Fisheries Wholesale Market and Garak Market.\n\n\nThe Yongsan Electronics Market is the largest electronics market in Asia. Electronics markets are Gangbyeon station metro line 2 Techno mart, ENTER6 MALL & Shindorim station Technomart mall complex.[106] Times Square is one of Seoul's largest shopping malls, and contains the world's largest permanent 35 mm cinema screen, the CGV Starium.[107]\n\n\nKorea World Trade Center Complex, which comprises COEX mall, congress center, 3 Inter-continental hotels, Business tower (Asem tower), Residence hotel, Casino and City airport terminal was established in 1988 in time for the Seoul Olympics. The 2nd World trade trade center is being planned at Seoul Olympic stadium complex as MICE HUB by Seoul city. Ex-Kepco head office building was purchased by Hyundai motor group with 9billion USD to build 115-storey Hyundai GBC & hotel complex until 2021. Now ex-kepco 25-storey building is under demolition.\n\n\n\n### Technology[edit]\n\n\nSeoul has been described as the world's \"most wired city\",[108] ranked first in technology readiness by PwC's *Cities of Opportunity* report.[109] Seoul has a very technologically advanced infrastructure.[110][111]\n\n\nSeoul is among the world leaders in Internet connectivity, being the capital of South Korea, which has the world's highest fiber-optic broadband penetration and highest global average internet speeds of 26.1 Mbit/s.[112][113] Since 2015, Seoul has provided free Wi-Fi access in outdoor spaces through a 47.7 billion won ($44 million) project with Internet access at 10,430 parks, streets and other public places.[114] Internet speeds in some apartment buildings reach up to 52.5Gbit/s with assistance from Nokia, and though the average standard consists of 100 Mbit/s services, providers nationwide are rapidly rolling out 1Gbit/s connections at the equivalent of US$20 per month.[115] In addition, the city is served by the KTX high-speed rail and the Seoul Subway, which provides 4G LTE, Wi-Fi, and DMB inside subway cars. 5G will be introduced commercially in March 2019 in Seoul.\n\n\n\n## Architecture[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Architecture of South Korea\n\n![](image)Bukchon Hanok Village, a traditional Seoul village built during the Joseon era\nThe traditional heart of Seoul is the old Joseon dynasty city, now the downtown area, where most palaces, government offices, corporate headquarters, hotels, and traditional markets are located. Cheonggyecheon, a stream that runs from west to east through the valley before emptying into the Han River, was for many years covered with concrete, but was recently restored by an urban revival project in 2005.[116] Jongno street, meaning \"Bell Street\", has been a principal street and one of the earliest commercial streets of the city,[117][118] on which one can find Bosingak, a pavilion containing a large bell. The bell signaled the different times of the day and controlled the four major gates to the city. North of downtown is Bukhan Mountain, and to the south is the smaller Namsan. Further south are the old suburbs, Yongsan District and Mapo District. Across the Han River are the newer and wealthier areas of Gangnam District, Seocho District and surrounding neighborhoods.\n\n\n\n### Historical architecture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sungnyemun (commonly known as Namdaemun)\nSeoul has many historical and cultural landmarks. In Amsa-dong Prehistoric Settlement Site, Gangdong District, neolithic remains were excavated and accidentally discovered by a flood in 1925.[119]\n\n\nUrban and civil planning was a key concept when Seoul was first designed to serve as a capital in the late 14th century. The Joseon dynasty built the \"Five Grand Palaces\" in Seoul—Changdeokgung, Changgyeonggung, Deoksugung, Gyeongbokgung and Gyeonghuigung—all of which are located in the Jongno and Jung Districts. Among them, Changdeokgung was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1997 as an \"outstanding example of Far Eastern palace architecture and garden design\". The main palace, Gyeongbokgung, underwent a large-scale restoration project.[120] The palaces are considered exemplary architecture of the Joseon period. Beside the palaces, Unhyeongung is known for being the royal residence of Regent Daewongun, the father of Emperor Gojong at the end of the Joseon Dynasty.\n\n\nSeoul has been surrounded by walls that were built to regulate visitors from other regions and protect the city in case of an invasion. Pungnap Toseong is a flat earthen wall built at the edge of the Han River, which is widely believed to be the site of Wiryeseong. Mongchon Toseong is another earthen wall built during the Baekje period that is now located inside the Olympic Park.[20] The Fortress Wall of Seoul was built early in the Joseon dynasty for protection of the city. After many centuries of destruction and rebuilding, about 2⁄3 of the wall remains, as well as six of the original eight gates. These gates include the south gate Namdaemun and the east gate Dongdaemun. Namdaemun was the oldest wooden gate until a 2008 arson attack, and was re-opened after complete restoration in 2013.[121] Located near the gates are the traditional markets and largest shopping center, Namdaemun Market and Dongdaemun Market.\n\n\n\n### Modern architecture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lotte World Tower\nVarious high-rise office buildings and residential buildings, like the Gangnam Finance Center, the Tower Palace, Namsan Seoul Tower, and the Lotte World Tower, dominate the city's skyline. The tallest building is Lotte World Tower, reaching a height of 555m. It opened to the public in April 2017. It is also the 6th highest building in the world.\n\n\nThe World Trade Center Seoul, located in Gangnam District, hosts various expositions and conferences. Also in Gangnam District is the COEX Mall, a large indoor shopping and entertainment complex. Downstream from Gangnam District is Yeouido, an island that is home to the National Assembly, major broadcasting studios, and a number of large office buildings, as well as the Korea Finance Building and the Yoido Full Gospel Church. The Olympic Stadium, Olympic Park, and Lotte World are located in Songpa District, on the south side of the Han River, upstream from Gangnam District. Three new modern landmarks of Seoul are Dongdaemun Design Plaza & Park, designed by Zaha Hadid, the new wave-shaped Seoul City Hall, by Yoo Kerl of iArc, and the Lotte World Tower, the 6th tallest building in the world designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox.\n\n\nIn 2010 Seoul was designated the World Design Capital for the year.[122]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n### Museums[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of museums in Seoul\n\n![](image)The National Museum of Korea\n![](image)The War Memorial of Korea\nSeoul is home to 115 museums,[123] including four national and nine official municipal museums. The National Museum of Korea has a collection of 220,000 artifacts.[124] The National Folk Museum is located on the grounds of Gyeongbokgung and focuses on the daily life of historical Koreans.[125] Bukchon Hanok Village and Namsangol Hanok Village are old residential districts consisting of *hanok* (traditional Korean houses).[126][127]\n\n\nThe War Memorial covers the history of wars that Korea has been involved with, especially the Korean War.[128][129] Seodaemun Prison is a former prison built during the Japanese occupation, and is used as a historic museum.[130]\n\n\nThe Seoul Museum of Art, Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art, and Ilmin Museum of Art are art museums in the city.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Religious monuments[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Myeongdong Cathedral\nThe city has buildings related to a number of religions. The Wongudan altar has been used since the Three Kingdoms Period.[*citation needed*] There are also a number of Confucian shrines, such as Jongmyo, Sajikdan, Munmyo, and Dongmyo. For Buddhism, Jogyesa is the headquarters of the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism. Hwagyesa and Bongeunsa are also major Buddhist temples in Seoul.\n\n\nThe Myeongdong Cathedral is a landmark of the Myeongdong, Jung District. Yakhyeon Catholic Church is the first Gothic church to be built in Korea.[*citation needed*] Yoido Full Gospel Church is a Pentecostal church affiliated with the Assemblies of God on Yeouido in Seoul.[*citation needed*] The St. Nicholas Cathedral, but sometimes called bald church, is the only Byzantine-style church in Seoul.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Festivals[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2012, KBS Hall in Seoul hosted major international music festivals – First ABU TV and Radio Song Festivals within frameworks of Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union 49th General Assembly.[131][*better source needed*][132]\nHi! Seoul Festival is a seasonal cultural festival held four times a year every spring, summer, autumn, and winter in Seoul, South Korea since 2003. It is based on the \"Seoul Citizens' Day\" held on every October since 1994 to commemorate the 600 years history of Seoul as the capital of the country. The festival is arranged under the Seoul Metropolitan Government. As of 2012[update], Seoul has hosted Ultra Music Festival Korea, an annual dance music festival that takes place on the 2nd weekend of June.[133]\n\n\n\n### Parks[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of parks in Seoul\n\n![](image)Seoul Botanic Park [ko]\n![](image)Han River Park\nSeoul has a large quantity of parks. One of the most famous parks is Namsan Park, which offers recreational hiking and views of the downtown Seoul skyline, especially via its N Seoul Tower. Seoul Olympic Park, located in Songpa District and built to host the 1988 Summer Olympics, is the largest park. The areas near the stream Tancheon are popular for exercise. Cheonggyecheon also has spaces for recreation. In 2017 the Seoullo 7017 Skypark opened, spanning diagonally overtop Seoul Station.\n\n\nThere are also many parks along the Han River, such as Ichon Hangang Park, Yeouido Hangang Park, Mangwon Hangang Park, Nanji Hangang Park, Banpo Hangang Park, Ttukseom Hangang Park and Jamsil Hangang Park. The Seoul National Capital Area also contains a green belt aimed at preventing the city from sprawling out into neighboring Gyeonggi Province. These areas are frequently sought after by people looking to escape from urban life on weekends and during vacations.\n\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Media of South Korea\n\n![](image)KBS headquarters in Yeouido, Seoul\nSeoul is home of the major South Korean networks KBS, SBS, and MBC.

Its system dates back to the era of the Korean Empire, when the first streetcar lines were laid and a railroad linking Seoul and Incheon was completed.[135] Seoul's most important streetcar line ran along Jongno until it was replaced by Line 1 of the subway system in the early 1970s. Other notable streets in downtown Seoul include Euljiro, Teheranno, Sejongno, Chungmuro, Yulgongno, and Toegyero. There are nine major subway lines stretching for more than 250 km (155 mi), with one additional line planned. As of 2010[update], 25% of the population has a commute time of an hour or longer.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Bus[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Seoul Buses\n\n![](image)Seoul buses\nSeoul's bus system is operated by the Seoul Metropolitan Government (S.M.G.), with four primary bus configurations available servicing most of the city. Seoul has many large intercity/express bus terminals. These buses connect Seoul with cities throughout South Korea. The Seoul Express Bus Terminal, Central City Terminal and Seoul Nambu Terminal are located in the district of Seocho District. In addition, East Seoul Bus Terminal in Gwangjin District and Sangbong Terminal in Jungnang District handles traffics mainly from Gangwon and Chungcheong provinces.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Urban rail[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Seoul Station\nMain article: Seoul Metropolitan Subway\n\nSeoul has a comprehensive urban railway network of 21 rapid transit, light metro and commuter lines that interconnects every district of the city and the surrounding areas of Incheon, Gyeonggi province, western Gangwon province, and northern Chungnam province. With more than 8 million passengers per day, the subway is one of the busiest subway systems in the world and the largest in the world, with a total track length of 940 km (580 mi). In addition, in order to cope with the various modes of transport, Seoul's metropolitan government employs several mathematicians to coordinate the subway, bus, and traffic schedules into one timetable. The various lines are run by Korail, Seoul Metro, NeoTrans Co. Ltd., AREX, and Seoul Metro Line 9 Corporation.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Train[edit]\n\n\n![](image)KTX Sancheon\nSeoul is connected to every major city in South Korea by rail. Most major South Korean cities are linked via the KTX high-speed train, which has a normal operation speed of more than 300 km/h (186 mph). The Mugunghwa and Saemaeul trains also stop at all major stations. Major railroad stations include:[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n* Seoul Station, Yongsan District: Gyeongbu line (KTX/ITX-Saemaeul/Nuriro/Mugunghwa-ho)\n* Yongsan station, Yongsan District: Honam line (KTX/ITX-Saemaeul/Nuriro/Mugunghwa), Jeolla/Janghang lines (Saemaul/Mugunghwa)\n* Yeongdeungpo station, Yeongdeungpo District: Gyeongbu/Honam/Janghang lines (KTX/ITX-Saemaeul/Saemaul/Nuriro/Mugunghwa)\n* Cheongnyangni station, Dongdaemun District: Gyeongchun/Jungang/Yeongdong/Taebaek lines (ITX-Cheongchun/ITX-Saemaeul/Mugunghwa)\n* Suseo station (HSR), Gangnam District: Suseo HSR (SRT)\n\n\n### Airports[edit]\n\n\nSeoul is served by two international airports, Incheon International Airport and Gimpo International Airport.\n\n\nGimpo International Airport opened in 1939 as an airfield for the Japanese Imperial Army and opened for civil aircraft in 1957. Since the opening of Incheon International, Gimpo International handles domestic flights along with some short haul international flights to Tokyo Haneda, Osaka Kansai, Taipei Songshan, Shanghai Hongqiao, and Beijing Capital although flights to Osaka Kansai and Beijing Capital also operate from Incheon International.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIncheon International Airport opened in March 2001 in Yeongjong island. It is now responsible for major international flights. Incheon International Airport is Asia's eighth busiest airport in terms of passengers, the world's fourth busiest airport by cargo traffic, and the world's eighth busiest airport in terms of international passengers in 2014. In 2016, 57,765,397 passengers used the airport. Incheon International Airport opened terminal 2 on 18 January 2018.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIncheon and Gimpo are linked to Seoul by expressway, and to each other by the AREX to Seoul Station. Intercity bus services are available to various destinations around the country.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Cycling[edit]\n\n\nCycling is becoming increasingly popular in Seoul and in the entire country. Both banks of the Han River have cycling paths that run all the way across the city along the river. In addition, Seoul introduced in 2015 a bicycle-sharing system named Ddareungi (and named Seoul Bike in English).[136]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Education in South Korea and List of universities in Seoul\n\n### Universities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Entrance of Seoul National University\nSeoul is home to the majority of South Korea's most prestigious universities, including Seoul National University, Yonsei University, Korea University.\n\n\nSeoul ranked 2nd on the QS Best Student Cities 2023.[137]\n\n\n\n### Secondary education[edit]\n\n\nCompulsory education lasts from grade 1–9 (six years of elementary school and 3 years of middle school).[138] Students spend six years in elementary school, three years in middle school, and three years in high school. Secondary schools generally require students to wear uniforms. There is an exit exam for graduating from high school and many students proceeding to the university level are required to take the College Scholastic Ability Test that is held every November. Although there is a test for non-high school graduates, called school qualification exam, most Koreans take the test.\n\n\nSeoul is home to various specialized schools, including three science high schools, and six foreign language High Schools. Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education comprises 235 College-Preparatory High Schools, 80 Vocational Schools, 377 Middle Schools, and 33 Special Education Schools as of 2009[update].\n\n\n\n## International relations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of diplomatic missions in South Korea\n\nSeoul is a member of the Asian Network of Major Cities 21 and the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group.
