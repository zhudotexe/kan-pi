The company was launched in August 1998 by three undergraduate students at the University of California, Berkeley: Senh Duong, Patrick Y. Lee, and Stephen Wang.[5][6][7][8] Although the name \"Rotten Tomatoes\" connects to the practice of audiences throwing rotten tomatoes in disapproval of a poor stage performance, the direct inspiration for the name from Duong, Lee, and Wang came from an equivalent scene in the 1992 Canadian film *Léolo*.[9]\n\n\nSince January 2010, Rotten Tomatoes has been owned by Flixster, which was in turn acquired by Warner Bros. in 2011. In February 2016, Rotten Tomatoes and its parent site Flixster were sold to Comcast's Fandango ticketing company.[10] Warner Bros. retained a minority stake in the merged entities, including Fandango.[1]\n\n\nThe site is influential among moviegoers, a third of whom say they consult it before going to the cinema in the U.S.[11] It has been criticized for oversimplifying reviews by flattening them into a fresh vs. rotten dichotomy.[12] It has also been criticized for being easy for studios to manipulate by limiting early screenings to critics inclined to be favorable, among other tactics.[12]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fandango headquarters in Beverly Hills (home to Rotten Tomatoes)\n![](image)Former IGN headquarters in Brisbane, California (home to Rotten Tomatoes during 2004–2010 IGN ownership)\nRotten Tomatoes was launched on August 12, 1998, as a spare-time project by Senh Duong.[13] His objective in creating Rotten Tomatoes was \"to create a site where people can get access to reviews from a variety of critics in the U.S\".[14] As a fan of Jackie Chan, Duong was inspired to create the website after collecting all the reviews of Chan's Hong Kong action movies as they were being released in the United States. The catalyst for the creation of the website was *Rush Hour* (1998), Chan's first major Hollywood crossover, which was originally planned to release in August 1998. Duong coded the website in two weeks and the site went live the same month, but the release of *Rush Hour* was delayed until September 1998. Besides Jackie Chan films, he began including other films on Rotten Tomatoes, extending it beyond Chan's fandom.[15][16] The first non-Chan Hollywood movie whose reviews were featured on Rotten Tomatoes was *Your Friends & Neighbors* (1998). The website was an immediate success, receiving mentions by Netscape, Yahoo!, and *USA Today* within the first week of its launch; it attracted \"600–1,000 daily unique visitors\" as a result.[17]\n\n\nDuong teamed up with University of California, Berkeley classmates Patrick Y. Lee and Stephen Wang, his former partners at the Berkeley, California-based web design firm Design Reactor, to pursue Rotten Tomatoes on a full-time basis. They officially launched it on April 1, 2000.[18]\n\n\nIn June 2004, IGN Entertainment acquired Rotten Tomatoes for an undisclosed sum.[19] In September 2005, IGN was bought by News Corp's Fox Interactive Media.[20] In January 2010, IGN sold the website to Flixster.[21] The combined reach of both companies is 30 million unique visitors a month across all different platforms, according to the companies.[22] In 2011, Warner Bros. acquired Rotten Tomatoes.[23]\n\n\nIn early 2009, Current Television launched *The Rotten Tomatoes Show*, a televised version of the web review site. It was hosted by Brett Erlich and Ellen Fox and written by Mark Ganek. The show aired Thursdays at 10:30 EST[24] until September 16, 2010. It returned as a much shorter segment of *InfoMania*, a satirical news show that ended in 2011.[25]\n\n\nBy late 2009, the website was designed to enable Rotten Tomatoes users to create and join groups to discuss various aspects of film. One group, \"The Golden Oyster Awards\", accepted votes of members for various awards, spoofing the better-known Academy Awards or Golden Globes. When Flixster bought the company, they disbanded the groups.[26][27]\n\n\nAs of February 2011, new community features have been added and others removed. For example, users can no longer sort films by Fresh Ratings from Rotten Ratings, and vice versa.[27]\n\n\nOn September 17, 2013, a section devoted to scripted television series, called TV Zone, was created as a subsection of the website.[28]\n\n\nIn February 2016, Rotten Tomatoes and its parent site Flixster were sold to Comcast's Fandango Media. Warner Bros retained a minority stake in the merged entities, including Fandango.[3]\n\n\nIn December 2016, Fandango and all its various websites moved to Fox Interactive Media's former headquarters in Beverly Hills, California.[29]\n\n\nIn July 2017, the website's editor-in-chief since 2007, Matt Atchity, left to join *The Young Turks* YouTube channel.[30] On November 1, 2017, the site launched a new web series on Facebook, *See It/Skip It*, hosted by Jacqueline Coley and Segun Oduolowu.[31]\n\n\nIn March 2018, the site announced its new design, icons and logo for the first time in 19 years at South by Southwest.[32]\n\n\nOn May 19, 2020, Rotten Tomatoes won the 2020 Webby People's Voice Award for Entertainment in the Web category.[33]\n\n\nIn February 2021, the Rotten Tomatoes staff made an entry on their Product Blog, announcing several design changes to the site:[34] Each film's 'Score Box' at the top of the page would now also include its release year, genre, and runtimes, with an MPAA rating to be soon added; the number of ratings would be shown in groupings – from 50+ up to 250,000+ ratings, for easier visualization. Links to critics and viewers are included underneath the ratings.[34] By clicking on either the Tomatometer Score or the Audience Score, the users can access \"Score Details\" information, such as the number of Fresh and Rotten reviews, average rating, and Top Critics' score. The team also added a new \"What to Know\" section for each film entry page, which could combine the \"Critics Consensus\" blurb with a new \"Audience Says\" blurb, so users can see an at-a-glance summary of the sentiments of both certified critics and verified audience members.[34]\n\n\n\n## Traffic[edit]\n\n\nAs of April 11, 2022, Rotten Tomatoes is a top 1000 site, being the 593rd highest-ranked website in the world, and #254 in the United States, according to website ranker Alexa.[35]\n\n\n\n## Features[edit]\n\n\n### Critics' aggregate score[edit]\n\n\nRotten Tomatoes staff first collect online reviews from writers who are certified members of various writing guilds or film critic-associations. To be accepted as a critic on the website, a critic's original reviews must garner a specific number of \"likes\" from users. Those classified as \"Top Critics\" generally write for major newspapers. The critics upload their reviews to the movie page on the website, and need to mark their review \"fresh\" if it is generally favorable or \"rotten\" otherwise. It is necessary for the critic to do so as some reviews are qualitative and do not grant a numeric score, making it impossible for the system to be automatic.[36]\n\n\nThe website keeps track of all the reviews counted for each film and calculates the percentage of positive reviews. Major recently released films can attract more than 400 reviews. If the positive reviews make up 60% or more, the film is considered \"fresh\". If the positive reviews are less than 60%, the film is considered \"rotten\". An average score on a 0 to 10 scale is also calculated. With each review, a short excerpt of the review is quoted that also serves a hyperlink to the complete review essay for anyone interested to read the critic's full thoughts on the subject.\n\n\n\"Top Critics\", such as Roger Ebert, Desson Thomson, Stephen Hunter, Owen Gleiberman, Lisa Schwarzbaum, Peter Travers and Michael Phillips are identified in a sub-listing that calculates their reviews separately. Their opinions are also included in the general rating. When there are sufficient reviews, the staff creates and posts a consensus statement to express the general reasons for the collective opinion of the film.\n\n\nThis rating is indicated by an equivalent icon at the film listing, to give the reader a one-glance look at the general critical opinion about the work. The \"Certified Fresh\" seal is reserved for movies that satisfy two criteria: a \"Tomatometer\" of 75% or better and at least 80 reviews (40 for limited release movies) from \"Tomatometer\" critics (including 5 Top Critics). Films earning this status will keep it unless the positive critical percentage drops below 70%.[37] Films with 100% positive ratings that lack the required number of reviews may not receive the \"Certified Fresh\" seal.\n\n\n\n#### Tomatometer scores[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Icon | Score | Description\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | 100–75% | **Certified Fresh**: Wide-release films with a score of 75% or higher that are reviewed by at least 80 critics, of whom 5 are \"Top Critics\", are given this seal. The \"Certified Fresh\" seal remains until the score drops below 70%.[37] Films with limited releases require only 40 reviews (including 5 from \"Top Critics\") to qualify for this seal. For TV shows, only individual seasons are eligible for consideration, and each must have at least 20 critic reviews.[37] |\n| ![](image) | 100–60% | **Fresh**: Films or TV shows with a score of 60% or higher that do not meet the requirements for the \"Certified Fresh\" seal.\n |\n| ![](image) | 59–0% | **Rotten**: Films or TV shows with a score of 59% or lower receive this seal.\n |\n\n\nWhen a film or TV show reaches the requirements for the \"Certified Fresh\", it is not automatically granted the seal, but is instead flagged for the staff's consideration. Once the team assesses the reviews and response to the film or TV show, and decide that it is unlikely that the score will fall below the minimum requirements in the future, they will then mark it as \"Certified Fresh\".[38]\n\n\n\n#### Golden Tomato Awards[edit]\n\n\nIn 2000, Rotten Tomatoes announced the RT Awards honoring the best-reviewed films of the year according to the website's rating system.[39] The awards were later renamed the Golden Tomato Awards.[40] The nominees and winners are announced on the website, although there is no actual awards ceremony.\n\n\nThe films are divided into wide release and limited release categories. Limited releases are defined as opening in 599 or fewer theaters at initial release. Platform releases, movies initially released under 600 theaters but later receiving wider distribution, fall under this definition. Any film opening in more than 600 theaters is considered wide release.[40] There are also two categories purely for British and Australian films. The \"User\"-category represents the highest rated film among users, and the \"Mouldy\"-award represents the worst-reviewed films of the year. A movie must have 40 (originally 20) or more rated reviews to be considered for domestic categories. It must have 500 or more user ratings to be considered for the \"User\"-category.\n\n\nFilms are further classified based on film genre. Each movie is eligible in only one genre, aside from non-English-language films, which can be included in both their genre and the respective \"Foreign\" category.\n\n\nOnce a film is considered eligible, its \"votes\" are counted. Each critic from the website's list gets one vote (as determined by their review), all weighted equally. Because reviews are continually added, manually and otherwise, a cutoff date at which new reviews are not counted toward the Golden Tomato awards is initiated each year, usually the first of the new year. Reviews without ratings are not counted toward the results of the Golden Tomato Awards.[40]\n\n\n\n### Audience score and reviews[edit]\n\n\n![Positive audience score](image)\n![Negative audience score](image)\nPositive and negative audience score icons\n\nEach movie features a \"user average\", which calculates the percentage of registered users who have rated the film positively on a 5-star scale, similar to calculation of recognized critics' reviews.\n\n\nOn May 24, 2019, Rotten Tomatoes introduced a verified rating system that would replace the earlier system where users were merely required to register in order to submit a rating. So, in addition to creating an account, users will have to verify their ticket purchase through Fandango Media, a ticketing company which Rotten Tomatoes is a subsidiary of. While users can still leave reviews without verifying, those reviews will not account for the average audience score displayed next to the Tomatometer.[41][42]\n\n\n\n### \"What to Know\"[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Example of a \"What to Know\" section for a Rotten Tomatoes entry page, for the 2017 film *Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle*\nIn February 2021, a new \"What to Know\" section was created for each film entry, combining the \"Critics Consensus\" and a new \"Audience Says\" blurbs within it, to give users an at-a-glance summary of the general sentiments of a film as experienced by critics and audiences.[34] Prior to February 2021, only the \"Critics Consensus\" blurb was posted for each entry, after enough certified critics had submitted reviews.[43] When the \"Audience Says\" blurbs were added, Rotten Tomatoes initially included them only for newer films and those with a significant audience rating, but suggested that they may later add them for older films as well.[34]\n\n\n\n#### \"Critics Consensus\" / \"Audience Says\"[edit]\n\n\nEach movie features a brief blurb summary of the critics' reviews, called the \"Critical Consensus\", used in that entry's Tomatometer aggregate score. These are written by Jeff Giles, a longtime author for the site.[44]\n\n\nIn February 2021, Rotten Tomatoes added an \"Audience Says\" section; similar to the \"Critics Consensus\", it summarizes the reviews noted by registered users into a concise blurb. The Rotten Tomatoes staff noted that for any given film, if there were any external factors such as controversies or issues affecting the sentiments of a film, they may address it in the \"Audience Says\" section in order to give users the most relevant info regarding their viewing choices.[34]\n\n\n\n### Localized versions[edit]\n\n\nLocalized versions of the site available in the United Kingdom, India, and Australia were discontinued following the acquisition of Rotten Tomatoes by Fandango. The Mexican version of the site, Tomatazos [es], remains active.\n\n\n\n### API[edit]\n\n\nThe Rotten Tomatoes API provides limited access to critic and audience ratings and reviews, allowing developers to incorporate Rotten Tomatoes data on other websites. The free service is intended for use in the US only; permission is required for use elsewhere.[45] As of 2022, API access is restricted to approved developers that must go through an application process.[46]\n\n\n\n## Influence[edit]\n\n\nMajor Hollywood studios have come to see Rotten Tomatoes as a potential threat to their marketing. In 2017, several blockbuster films like *Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales*, *Baywatch* and *The Mummy* were projected to open with gross receipts of $90 million, $50 million and $45 million, respectively, but ended up debuting with $62.6 million, $23.1 million and $31.6 million. Rotten Tomatoes, which scored the films at 30%, 19% and 16%, respectively, was blamed for undermining them. That same summer, films like *Wonder Woman* and *Spider-Man: Homecoming* (both 92%) received high scores and opened at or exceeded expectations with their $100+ million trackings.[47][48][49]\n\n\nAs result of this concern, 20th Century Fox commissioned a 2015 study, titled \"Rotten Tomatoes and Box Office\", that stated the website combined with social media was going to be an increasingly serious complication for the film business: \"The power of Rotten Tomatoes and fast-breaking word of mouth will only get stronger. Many Millennials and even Gen X-ers now vet every purchase through the Internet, whether it's restaurants, video games, make-up, consumer electronics or movies. As they get older and comprise an even larger share of total moviegoers, this behavior is unlikely to change\".[50] Other studios have commissioned a number of studies on the subject, with them finding that 7/10 people said they would be less interested in seeing a film if the Rotten Tomatoes score was below 25%, and that the site has the most influence on people 25 and younger.[49]\n\n\nThe scores have reached a level of online ubiquity which film companies have found threatening. For instance, the scores are regularly posted in Google search results for films so reviewed. Furthermore, the scores are prominently featured in Fandango's popular ticket purchasing website, on its mobile app, on popular streaming services like Peacock, and on Flixster, which led to complaints that \"rotten\" scores damaged films' performances.[51]\n\n\nOthers have argued that filmmakers and studios have only themselves to blame if Rotten Tomatoes produces a bad score, as this only reflects a poor reception among film critics. As one independent film distributor marketing executive noted, \"To me, it's a ridiculous argument that Rotten Tomatoes is the problem ... make a good movie!\".[52] ComScore's Paul Dergarabedian had similar comments, saying: \"The best way for studios to combat the 'Rotten Tomatoes Effect' is to make better movies, plain and simple\".[49]\n\n\nSome studios have suggested embargoing or cancelling early critic screenings in a response to poor reviews prior to a film's release affecting pre-sales and opening weekend numbers.[48] In July 2017, Sony embargoed critic reviews for *The Emoji Movie* until mid-day the Thursday before its release. The film ended up with a 9% rating (including 0% after the first 25 reviews), but still opened to $24 million, on par with projections. Josh Greenstein, Sony Pictures President of Worldwide Marketing and Distribution, said, \"*The Emoji Movie* was built for people under 18 ... so we wanted to give the movie its best chance. What other wide release with a score under 8 percent has opened north of $20 million? I don't think there is one\". Conversely, Warner Bros. also did not do critic pre-screenings for *The House*, which held a score of 16% until the day of its release, and opened to just $8.7 million; the lowest of star Will Ferrell's career.[49]\n\n\nThat marketing tactic can backfire, and drew the vocal disgust of influential critics such as Roger Ebert, who was prone to derisively condemn such moves, with gestures such as \"The Wagging Finger of Shame\", on *At the Movies*.[53] Furthermore, the very nature of withholding reviews can draw early conclusions from the public that the film is of poor quality because of that marketing tactic.[54]\n\n\nOn February 26, 2019, in response to issues surrounding coordinated \"bombing\" of user reviews for several films, most notably *Captain Marvel* and *Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker*, prior to their release, the site announced that user reviews would no longer be accepted until a film is publicly released. The site also announced plans to introduce a system for \"verified\" reviews, and that the \"Want to See\" statistic would now be expressed as a number so that it would not be confused with the audience score.[55][56]\n\n\nIn April 2023, a 2017 film titled *The Snowman*, starring Michael Fassbender reached the No. 1 spot in America on Netflix's Current Top 10 Most Watched list, despite it holding a score on Rotten Tomatoes of 6%.[57]\n\n\nDespite arguments on how Rotten Tomatoes scores impact the box office,[58] academic researchers so far have not found evidence that Rotten Tomatoes ratings affect box office performance.[59]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Oversimplification[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2010, on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the New York Film Critics Circle, its chairman Armond White cited Rotten Tomatoes in particular and film review aggregators in general as examples of how \"the Internet takes revenge on individual expression\". He said they work by \"dumping reviewers onto one website and assigning spurious percentage-enthusiasm points to the discrete reviews\". According to White, such websites \"offer consensus as a substitute for assessment\".[60] Landon Palmer, a film and media historian and an assistant professor in the Department of Journalism and Creative Media director in the College of Communication and Information Sciences at the University of Alabama[61] agreed with White, stating that \"[Rotten Tomatoes applies a] problematic algorithm to pretty much all avenues of modern media art and entertainment\".[62]\n\n\nDirector and producer Brett Ratner has criticized the website for \"reducing hundreds of reviews culled from print and online sources into a popularized aggregate score\", while expressing respect for traditional film critics.[63] Writer Max Landis, following his film *Victor Frankenstein* receiving an approval rating of 24% on the site, wrote that the site \"breaks down entire reviews into just the word 'yes' or 'no', making criticism binary in a destructive arbitrary way\".[64]\n\n\n\n### Other criticisms[edit]\n\n\nAmerican director Martin Scorsese wrote a column in *The Hollywood Reporter* criticizing both Rotten Tomatoes and CinemaScore for promoting the idea that films like *Mother!* had to be \"instantly liked\" to be successful.[65] Scorsese, in a dedication for the Roger Ebert Center for Film Studies at the University of Illinois later continued his criticism, voicing that Rotten Tomatoes and other review services \"devalue cinema on streaming platforms to the level of content\".[66]\n\n\nIn 2015, while promoting the film *Suffragette* (which has a 73% approval rating)[67] actress Meryl Streep accused Rotten Tomatoes of disproportionately representing the opinions of male film critics, resulting in a skewed ratio that adversely affected the commercial performances of female-driven films. \"I submit to you that men and women are not the same, they like different things,\" she said. \"Sometimes they like the same thing, but sometimes their tastes diverge. If the Tomatometer is slighted so completely to one set of tastes that drives box office in the United States, absolutely\".[68] Critics took issue with the sentiment that someone's gender or ethnic background would dictate their response to art.[69]\n\n\nRotten Tomatoes deliberately withheld the critic score for *Justice League* based on early reviews until the premiere of its *See It/Skip It* episode on the Thursday before its release. Some critics viewed the move as a ploy to promote the web series, but some argued that the move was a deliberate conflict of interest on account of Warner Bros.' ownership of the film and Rotten Tomatoes, and the tepid critical reception of the DC Extended Universe films at the time.[70]\n\n\n*The New York Times* aggregated statistics on the critical reception of audience scores versus critic scores, and noticed in almost every genre that \"The public rates a movie more positively than do the critics. The only exceptions are black comedies and documentaries. Critics systematically rate films in these genres more highly than do Rotten Tomatoes users\".[71] *Slate* magazine collected data in a similar survey that revealed a noticeable favor for movies released before the 1990s, that \"may be explained by a bias toward reviewers reviewing, or Rotten Tomatoes scoring, only the best movies from bygone eras\".[72]\n\n\n*Vulture* ran an article in September 2023 that raised several criticisms, including the ease at which large companies are able to manipulate reviewer ratings. The article cited publicity company Bunker 15 as an example of how scores can be boosted by recruiting obscure, often self-published reviewers to write positively, or selectively hiding negative reviews, using the example of 2018's *Ophelia*.[12]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Internet portal\n* ![](image)Film portal\n\n\n* Metacritic\n* Internet Movie Database (IMDb)\n* List of films with a 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes\n* List of films with a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes\n* \"Splatty Tomato\"\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Spangler, Todd (May 23, 2019). \"Rotten Tomatoes Revamps Movie Audience Scores to Focus on Verified Ticket Buyers\". *Variety*.

Their work has been well-received by audiences and recognized with numerous awards. Their mascot and most recognizable symbol, the character Totoro, is a giant spirit inspired by raccoon dogs (*tanuki*) and cats[5] from the 1988 film *My Neighbor Totoro*. Among the studio's highest-grossing films are *Spirited Away* (2001), *Howl's Moving Castle* (2004), and *Ponyo* (2008).[6] Studio Ghibli was founded on June 15, 1985, by the directors Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata and producer Toshio Suzuki, after acquiring Topcraft's assets. The studio has also collaborated with video game studios on the visual development of several games.[7]\n\n\nFive of the studio's films are among the ten highest-grossing anime feature films made in Japan. *Spirited Away* is second, grossing 31.68 billion yen in Japan and over US$380 million worldwide; and *Princess Mononoke* is fourth, grossing 20.18 billion yen. Three of their films have won the Animage Grand Prix award, four have won the Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year, and five have received Academy Award nominations. *Spirited Away* won the 2002 Golden Bear and the 2003 Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.[8]\n\n\nOn August 3, 2014, Studio Ghibli temporarily suspended production following Miyazaki's retirement. In February 2017, Suzuki announced that Miyazaki had come out of retirement to direct a new feature film, *The Boy and the Heron* (2023).[9][10] In September 2023, Nippon TV announced that Studio Ghibli would become a unit of Nippon Television Holdings in October.[11]\n\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\nThe name \"Ghibli\" was chosen by Miyazaki from the Italian noun *ghibli* (also used in English), an Italianization of the Libyan Arabic name for a hot desert wind (قبلي *ghiblī*) and nickname of the Italian Caproni Ca.309 aircraft. The name was chosen by Miyazaki due to his passion for aviation and also for the idea that the studio would \"blow a new wind through the anime industry\".[12][13] Although the Italian word would be more accurately transliterated as \"Giburi\" (ギブリ), with a hard g sound, the studio's name is written in Japanese as *Jiburi* (ジブリ, [d͡ʑiꜜbɯ̟ᵝɾʲi] ⓘ).[12]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Tokuma Shoten era[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nHayao Miyazaki\n![](image)\nToshio Suzuki\n![](image)\nIsao Takahata\nMiyazaki, Suzuki, and Takahata founded Studio Ghibli in 1985, alongside Yasuyoshi Tokuma.\n\nFounded on June 15, 1985, Studio Ghibli was headed by directors Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata and producer Toshio Suzuki. Miyazaki and Takahata had already had long careers in Japanese film and television animation and had worked together on *The Great Adventure of Horus, Prince of the Sun* in 1968 and the *Panda! Go, Panda!* films in 1972 and 1973. Suzuki had been an editor at Tokuma Shoten's *Animage* manga magazine.[14]\n\n\nThe studio was founded after the success of the 1984 film *Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind*. Suzuki was part of the film's production team, and founded Studio Ghibli with Miyazaki, who also invited Takahata to join them.[15][16][17]\n\n\nThe studio has mainly produced films by Miyazaki, with the second most prolific director being Takahata (most notably with *Grave of the Fireflies*). Other directors who have worked with Studio Ghibli include Yoshifumi Kondō, Hiroyuki Morita, Gorō Miyazaki, and Hiromasa Yonebayashi. Composer Joe Hisaishi has provided the soundtracks for most of Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli films. In their book *Anime Classics Zettai!*, Brian Camp and Julie Davis made note of Michiyo Yasuda as \"a mainstay of Studio Ghibli's extraordinary design and production team\".[18] At one time the studio was based in Kichijōji, Musashino, Tokyo.[19]\n\n\nIn August 1996, The Walt Disney Company and Tokuma Shoten formed a partnership wherein Walt Disney Studios would be the sole international distributor for Tokuma Shoten's Studio Ghibli animated films.[20] Under this agreement, Disney also agreed to finance 10% of the studio's production costs.[21] Since then, all three of the aforementioned films by Miyazaki at Studio Ghibli that were previously dubbed by Streamline Pictures have been re-dubbed by Disney.[22] On June 1, 1997, Tokuma Shoten Publishing consolidated its media operations by merging Studio Ghibli, Tokuma Shoten Intermedia software and Tokuma International under one location.[23]\n\n\nOver the years, there has been a close relationship between Studio Ghibli and the magazine *Animage*, which regularly runs exclusive articles on the studio and its members in a section titled \"Ghibli Notes\". Artwork from Ghibli's films and other works are frequently featured on the cover of the magazine. Saeko Himuro's novel *Umi ga Kikoeru* was serialised in the magazine and subsequently adapted into *Ocean Waves*, Studio Ghibli's first animated feature-length film created for television. It was directed by Tomomi Mochizuki.[24]\n\n\nIn October 2001, the Ghibli Museum opened in Mitaka, Tokyo.[25] It contains exhibits based on Studio Ghibli films and shows animations, including a number of short Studio Ghibli films not available elsewhere.\n\n\nThe studio is also known for its strict \"no-edits\" policy in licensing their films abroad due to *Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind* being heavily edited for the film's release in the United States as *Warriors of the Wind*.\n\n\n\n### Independent era[edit]\n\n\nBetween 1999 and 2005, Studio Ghibli was a subsidiary brand of Tokuma Shoten; however, that partnership ended in April 2005, when Studio Ghibli was spun off from Tokuma Shoten and was re-established as an independent company with relocated headquarters.\n\n\nOn February 1, 2008, Toshio Suzuki stepped down from the position of Studio Ghibli president, which he had held since 2005, and Koji Hoshino (former president of Walt Disney Japan) took over. Suzuki said he wanted to improve films with his own hands as a producer, rather than demanding this from his employees. Suzuki decided to hand over the presidency to Hoshino because Hoshino has helped Studio Ghibli to sell its videos since 1996 and has also aided the release of the *Princess Mononoke* film in the United States.[26] Suzuki still serves on the company's board of directors.\n\n\nTakahata developed a project for release after Gorō Miyazaki's (director of *Tales from Earthsea* and Hayao's son) *The Tale of the Princess Kaguya* – an adaptation of *The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter*. The last film Hayao Miyazaki directed before retiring from feature films was *The Wind Rises* which is about the Mitsubishi A6M Zero and its creator.[27]\n\n\nOn Sunday, September 1, 2013, Hayao Miyazaki held a press conference in Venice to confirm his retirement, saying: \"I know I've said I would retire many times in the past. Many of you must think, 'Once again.' But this time I am quite serious.\"[28]\n\n\nIn 2013, a documentary directed by Mami Sunada called *The Kingdom of Dreams and Madness* (Japanese: 夢と狂気の王国, Hepburn: *Yume to kyōki no ōkoku*) was created delving into the lives of those working at Studio Ghibli and the productions of the animated films *The Wind Rises* and *The Tale of the Princess Kaguya*, including storyboard sketching, inking, painting, and voice actor selection for the films.[29]\n\n\nOn January 31, 2014, it was announced that Gorō Miyazaki will direct his first anime television series, *Sanzoku no Musume Rōnya*, an adaptation of Astrid Lindgren's *Ronia the Robber's Daughter* for NHK. The series is computer-animated, produced by Polygon Pictures, and co-produced by Studio Ghibli.[30][31]\n\n\nIn March 2014, Toshio Suzuki retired as producer and assumed the new position of general manager. Yoshiaki Nishimura replaced Suzuki in the producer role.[32]\n\n\nOn August 3, 2014, Toshio Suzuki announced that Studio Ghibli would take a \"brief pause\" to re-evaluate and restructure in the wake of Miyazaki's retirement. He stated some concerns about where the company would go in the future.[33][34][35][36] This led to speculation that Studio Ghibli will never produce another feature film again. On November 7, 2014, Miyazaki stated, \"That was not my intention, though. All I did was announce that I would be retiring and not making any more features.\"[37] Lead producer Yoshiaki Nishimura among several other staffers from Ghibli, such as director Hiromasa Yonebayashi, left to found Studio Ponoc in April 2015, working on the film *Mary and the Witch's Flower*.\n\n\nThe 2016 animated fantasy film *The Red Turtle*, directed and co-written by Dutch-British animator Michaël Dudok de Wit in his feature film debut, was a co-production between Studio Ghibli and Wild Bunch.[38]\n\n\nIn February 2017, Toshio Suzuki announced that Hayao Miyazaki had come out of retirement to direct a new feature film with Studio Ghibli.[39]\n\n\nOn November 28, 2017, Koji Hoshino stepped down as president; he was replaced by Kiyofumi Nakajima (former Ghibli Museum director). Hoshino was then appointed as Chairman of Studio Ghibli.[40][41]\n\n\nIn May 2020, Toshio Suzuki confirmed that a new film from Gorō Miyazaki is in development at Studio Ghibli. On June 3, 2020, Studio Ghibli announced that the film would be an adaptation of the novel *Earwig and the Witch* by Diana Wynne Jones. The film was announced as the first full 3D CG animated Ghibli film and slated for a television premiere on NHK in late 2020.[42] The company had a net income of ¥1.253 billion, and a total asset worth ¥24.521 billion by August 2021.[43]\n\n\nOn November 1, 2022, the Studio Ghibli themed amusement park Ghibli Park opened.[44]\n\n\nOn April 4, 2023, Koji Hoshino announced that he had stepped down as chairman, and would serve as a representative director before planning to exit Studio Ghibli completely during the company's annual general shareholder's meeting in June, one month prior to the release of director Hayao Miyazaki's final movie *The Boy and the Heron* on July 14. He also announced that Toshio Suzuki would be replacing Kiyofumi Nakajima as president of Studio Ghibli, assuming the role for the first time since 2008, while Nakajima would continue to serve as a director.[45] This change of management came about amidst reports that Suzuki had allegedly been mismanaging company funds by directing them towards his girlfriend's failed business ventures. This reportedly created tension between Suzuki and Hoshino, with the latter reportedly citing it as a long-term internal problem at the company since the couple met in 2013 and was the reason for his planned departure from the company, although a spokesperson for Studio Ghibli in a statement to *Variety* denied that Hoshino's departure had anything to do with these reports.[46][47][48] The source of the allegations came from the tabloid paper, *Shūkan Josei* and was not corroborated by the mainstream media in Japan.[49]\n\n\n\n### Nippon TV era[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2023, the studio became a subsidiary of Nippon Television Holdings, Inc.. Studio Ghibli's leadership transitioned to Hiroyuki Fukuda, a senior executive at Nippon TV. Toshio Suzuki became Chairman and Hayao Miyazaki became Honorary Chairman. Nippon TV acquired a 42.3% stake in Studio Ghibli. The decision was driven by the advanced ages of Miyazaki and Suzuki, aged 82 and 75, respectively. The studio had considered Miyazaki's son, Goro Miyazaki, as a successor but opted for external leadership due to concerns and Goro's reluctance. Nippon TV started to handle management, allowing Studio Ghibli to focus on creative endeavors.[11][50] The takeover took effect on October 6.[51]\n\n\n\n## Distribution rights[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical and home media rights[edit]\n\n\n#### Japan[edit]\n\n\nIn Japan, the company's films (along with *The Castle of Cagliostro* and all other *Lupin the Third* titles for movie theaters as well as *Mary and the Witch's Flower*) are distributed by Toho theatrically, except for *Castle in the Sky*, *Kiki's Delivery Service* (which were distributed by Toei Company along with *Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind*, with Toei producing *The Great Adventure of Horus, Prince of the Sun*), and *My Neighbors the Yamadas*, which was distributed by Shochiku.\n\n\nFor home media, a majority of Studio Ghibli releases are distributed by Walt Disney Studios Japan. This also includes *Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind*, *The Castle of Cagliostro* and *Mary and the Witch's Flower*.[52] Pony Canyon occasionally releases Ghibli documentaries on home media, and also distributes rental versions of Ghibli's movies under a deal with Disney. Pony Canyon also fully distributed the standalone version of *Earwig and the Witch* on home media.\n\n\nBefore the Disney deal, Tokuma Shoten released Ghibli movies themselves through their \"Animage Video\" imprint, as well as all Laserdisc releases of the movies, as the Disney deal did not include that format.\n\n\n\n#### International[edit]\n\n\nAfter purchasing the global distribution rights from World Film Corporation,[53] Manson International and Showmen, Inc. produced a 95-minute English dub of *Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind*, titled *Warriors of the Wind*,[54] which was released theatrically in the United States by New World Pictures on June 14, 1985, followed by a VHS release in December 1985.[55][56] The voice actors and actresses were not credited, and the film was heavily edited to give it a faster pace.[57] The film received a PG rating just like Disney's later English dub.[58] By removing several of the longer dialogue scenes, some of the environmentalist themes were simplified as was the main subplot of the Ohmu, altered to remove Nausicaä's childhood connection to them.[59] Most of the characters' names were changed, including the titular character who became Princess Zandra. The North American poster and VHS cover featured a cadre of male characters who are not in the film, riding the resurrected God Warrior—including a still-living Warrior shown briefly in a flashback. Overall, approximately 22 minutes was cut for North American release.[58] *Warriors of the Wind* also prompted Miyazaki to allow translator Toren Smith of Studio Proteus to create an official, faithful translation of the *Nausicaä* manga for Viz Media.[60]\n\n\nIn the late 1980s, an English dub of *Castle in the Sky* was produced for international Japan Airlines flights at the request of Tokuma Shoten. The *Castle* dub was briefly screened in the United States by Streamline Pictures. Carl Macek, the head of Streamline, was disappointed with this dub, deeming it \"adequate, but clumsy\".[61] Following this, Tokuma allowed Streamline to dub their future acquisitions *My Neighbor Totoro* and *Kiki's Delivery Service*. In April 1993, Troma Films, under their 50th St. Films banner, distributed the *Totoro* dub as a theatrical release, and the dub was later released onto VHS and eventually onto DVD by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment. In the early 1990s, an English dub of *Porco Rosso* was produced by an unknown company, again for international Japan Airlines flights. The original dubs can be seen on the 1996 Ghibli ga Ippai Laserdisc set, and on the initial copies for the Japanese DVD releases of *Totoro*, *Laputa* and *Porco*.\n\n\nIn 1996, Walt Disney Studios acquired worldwide distribution rights to the Studio Ghibli library, with Disney redubbing all previously dubbed films.[20][62] In addition, Walt Disney Studios Japan agreed to contribute 10% of the funding for all future releases, starting with *My Neighbors the Yamadas*, in exchange for right of first refusal regarding international distribution.[21] Disney continues with this practice to this day, even extending it to the works of Studio Ponoc and to co-productions like *The Red Turtle* in Japan. It was said to have taken four years for Disney and Studio Ghibli to reach a distribution deal. Originally, the Ghibli films were meant to headline a line of videos called *Animation Celebration*, highlighting critically acclaimed animated films from around the world. These plans never materialized in full, but the *Animation Celebration* logo can be seen on Disney's original VHS release of *Kiki's Delivery Service*. During Disney's tenure, the studio produced the English dubs and released 15 of Ghibli's films, plus *Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind*, through the Walt Disney Pictures, Buena Vista Home Video, Miramax and Touchstone Pictures banners.[63]\n\n\nDisney and Ghibli have also selectively chosen not to promote and record an English-dubbed version for films and works deemed less internationally marketable, including some of Takahata's more developmental and obscure pieces.[64] Although the Studio has a \"No cuts\" policy in terms of international versions and dubs, this does not apply to promotional posters, etc., for which the film makers collaborate with Disney to produce cultural appropriate international versions. The Studio has not shied away from slight rebranding on the international stage in order to convey slightly tweaked promotional imagery for different cultural norms. One example of these slight tweaks to international promotional materials can be seen between the Japanese and English versions of the movie poster for *Spirited Away* (2001). For American and other English-speaking audiences, the name of the film was changed from the Japanese version, which directly translates roughly to, \"The Disappearance of Chihiro and Sen\", to *Spirited Away* to suggest more mystical, otherworldly themes, since the direct Japanese translation could be taken to mean that Chihiro/Sen disappeared due to some more dangerous reason. On the American movie poster, more pictures of spirits from the film were added to the background to further pique the viewer's interest with more supernatural themes, creating an association between the pictures spirits and what most American people would think of as \"ghosts\". For the Japanese poster, there are fewer spirits as the Japanese Shinto religion normalizes the existence of spirits, so less emphasis is needed to convey the importance of non-human spirits. Also, Disney enlarged the \"Studio Ghibli\" and \"Hayao Miyazaki\" labels on the poster, helping to bring greater awareness to the studio through the success of *Spirited Away*.[65]\n\n\nIn 2011, GKIDS acquired the North American theatrical distribution rights of the aforementioned Ghibli films, with Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment retaining the home video rights.[66] Afterwards, in 2013, GKIDS acquired the US and Canadian distribution rights to *From Up on Poppy Hill*. The film, which Disney passed on to GKIDS due to dealing with potential incest, marked the first time since 1996 that Disney handed a Studio Ghibli film off to another distributor. Afterwards, GKIDS would go on to distribute the films Disney found to be too mature or unmarketable for American audiences: *Only Yesterday*, *Ocean Waves*, *The Tale of the Princess Kaguya* and *When Marnie Was There*. Finally, in July 2017, Disney relinquished its home video rights (with the exception of *The Wind Rises*, which remained with Disney until 2020 due to a distribution clause) to GKIDS, which handles all theatrical and home media distribution of Ghibli films in North America along with *Mary and the Witch's Flower*.[62] Nevertheless, Disney still continues to handle select distribution in Japan (home media), Taiwan and China.\n\n\nGKIDS' home media releases have been handled by multiple distributors. Cinedigm distributed the home media release of *Poppy Hill*, Universal Pictures Home Entertainment distributed the home media releases of *Kaguya*, *Marnie*, *Mary*, *Yesterday* and *Waves*, and Shout! Factory all subsequent releases thus far. The Ghibli films owned by GKIDS were made available for digital purchases on most major services in the United States and Canada on December 17, 2019, through Shout! Factory.[67]\n\n\nOutside Asia (including Japan) and North America since 2003, Goodfellas (a former subsidiary of Wild Bunch, formerly known as Wild Bunch International) has been Studio Ghibli's international sales holder.\n\n\nIndividual rights to Ghibli's films are held by various third parties, including Wild Bunch (France and Belgium)[a],[68] Elysian Film Group (United Kingdom and Ireland),[b] Leonine (Germany), Lucky Red (Italy), Vértigo Films (Spain)[c], Crunchyroll Store Australia (Australia and New Zealand)[d] and Encore Films[e] in Singapore and Southeast Asia.\n\n\nNotably, *The Secret World of Arrietty* received a second dub exclusive to the United Kingdom, produced by StudioCanal UK, likely due to the film's origins being from Mary Norton's British novel *The Borrowers*.\n\n\nDisney formerly held international sales rights until they were sold off to Goodfellas (then Wild Bunch) in 2003. Disney kept the French distribution rights to Ghibli's library until September 2020, when it had expired and transitioned off to Wild Bunch.[70] Since 2021, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment serves as the home media distributor of Studio Ghibli's catalog via its distribution deal with Wild Bunch through the Wild Side Vidéo label.[71][72][73]\n\n\n\n### Streaming rights[edit]\n\n\nPrior to 2019, Studio Ghibli opted not to make its films available digitally, feeling that physical media and theatrical events like GKIDS' Studio Ghibli Fest would work more towards their goal of mindful care and curation for their films. Disney had previously lobbied for a streaming deal with Ghibli during their distribution tenure, but such attempts were never materialized.[63] The studio heads changed their minds after hearing a quote from American actor and director Woody Allen about how there should be multiple outlets for feature films.[74]\n\n\nOn October 17, 2019, Warner Bros. Discovery's HBO Max (now Max) announced it had acquired exclusive streaming rights to Studio Ghibli's catalogue in the United States as part of a deal with GKIDS; these films were available when the service launched in May 2020.[75] On January 20, 2020, it was announced that Netflix acquired the exclusive streaming rights to this catalogue in all regions where it operates except for the United States (in which Netflix does have streaming rights to *The Castle of Cagliostro* and *Mary and the Witch's Flower*), as part of a deal with Ghibli's international sales rights partner Wild Bunch. Seven of twenty-one films in the studio's catalogue were released on February 1, 2020, with the others following on March 1 and April 1.[76] Netflix then struck a separate deal with GKIDS for streaming rights in Canada which was announced on June 22, and came into effect on June 25 for most films.[77] Currently,[*when?*] no streaming rights deals have been announced for Studio Ghibli's home country of Japan, nor for markets such as China where neither Netflix nor HBO Max is available.\n\n\n\n### *Grave of the Fireflies*[edit]\n\n\nMost of the above deals exclude *Grave of the Fireflies*; unlike most of the other films, which were published by Tokuma Shoten, *Grave of the Fireflies* was produced and is owned by Shinchosha, which also had published the short story it was based on, and as such, fell into different rights holdings.[67]\n\n\n*Grave of the Fireflies* was released in Japan on VHS by Buena Vista Home Entertainment under the *Ghibli ga Ippai* Collection on August 7, 1998. On July 29, 2005, a DVD release was distributed through Warner Home Video. Walt Disney Studios Japan released the complete collector's edition DVD on August 6, 2008. WDSJ released the film on Blu-ray twice on July 18, 2012: one as a single release, and one in a two-film set with *My Neighbor Totoro*.\n\n\nIt was released on VHS in North America by Central Park Media in a subtitled form on June 2, 1993.[78] They later released the film with an English dub on VHS on September 1, 1998 (the same day Disney released *Kiki's Delivery Service* in North America) and an all-Regions DVD (which also included the original Japanese with English subtitles) on October 7 the same year. It was later released on a two-disc DVD set (which once again included both the English dub and the original Japanese with English subtitles as well as the film's storyboards with the second disc containing more extensive Bonus Features) on October 8, 2002. It was released by Central Park Media one last time on December 7, 2004. Following the May 2009 bankruptcy and liquidation of Central Park Media,[79] ADV Films acquired the rights and re-released it on DVD on July 7, 2009.[80] Following the September 1, 2009 shutdown and re-branding of ADV,[81] their successor, Sentai Filmworks, rescued the film and released a remastered DVD on March 6, 2012.[82][83] A Blu-ray edition was released on November 20, 2012, featuring an all-new English dub produced by Seraphim Digital, along with a digital release that same year.[84]\n\n\nStudioCanal released a Blu-ray in the United Kingdom on July 1, 2013.[85] Madman Entertainment released the film in Australia and New Zealand.\n\n\n\n## Works[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Studio Ghibli works\n\nWhile not technically Studio Ghibli films, *The Great Adventure of Horus, Prince of the Sun* (1968), *Panda! Go Panda!* (1972), *The Castle of Cagliostro* (1979), *Jarinko Chie* (1981), *Gauche the Cellist* (1982), *Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind* (1984), *The Red Turtle* (2016), *Mary and the Witch's Flower* (2017) and *Modest Heroes* (2018) are sometimes grouped together with the Studio Ghibli library (particularly with the *Ghibli ga Ippai* home video collection released by Walt Disney Studios Japan) due to their ties to the studio.\n\n\n*Horus* and *Cagliostro* were the feature-length directorial debuts of Isao Takahata and Hayao Miyazaki respectively, and were produced by Toei Animation and TMS Entertainment years before the founding of Studio Ghibli.\n\n\n*Nausicaä* was directed by Miyazaki at Topcraft, a studio which Miyazaki, Takahata and Toshio Suzuki later purchased and renamed Studio Ghibli. As a result, the film has often been rereleased and marketed as a Studio Ghibli movie.\n\n\n*The Red Turtle* was a collaborative effort by Studio Ghibli with Dutch animator Michaël Dudok de Wit and was branded as a Studio Ghibli release internationally. It was distributed by Sony Pictures Classics in North and Latin America.\n\n\nFor the purposes of the list below, films that appear in Studio Ghibli's official filmography[86] are listed. Other Studio Ghibli productions are listed here.\n\n\n\n### Feature films[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Director\n | Screenwriter(s)\n | Producer(s)\n | Composer\n | Original release\n | RT | MC |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1984\n | *Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind* | Hayao Miyazaki | Isao Takahata | Joe Hisaishi | March 11, 1984\n | 90%[87] | 86[88] |\n| 1986\n | *Castle in the Sky* | August 2, 1986\n | 96%[89] | 78[90] |\n| 1988\n | *My Neighbor Totoro* | Tōru Hara\n | April 16, 1988\n | 93%[91] | 86[92] |\n| *Grave of the Fireflies* | Isao Takahata | Michio Mamiya | 100%[93] | 94[94] |\n| 1989\n | *Kiki's Delivery Service* | Hayao Miyazaki | Joe Hisaishi | July 29, 1989\n | 98%[95] | 83[96] |\n| 1991\n | *Only Yesterday* | Isao Takahata | Toshio Suzuki | Katz Hoshi\n | July 20, 1991\n | 100%[97] | 90[98] |\n| 1992\n | *Porco Rosso* | Hayao Miyazaki | Joe Hisaishi | July 18, 1992\n | 96%[99] | 83[100] |\n| 1993\n | *Ocean Waves* | Tomomi Mochizuki | Seiji OkudaNozomu Takahashi\n | Shigeru Nagata\n | May 5, 1993[A] | 89%[101] | 73[102] |\n| 1994\n | *Pom Poko* | Isao Takahata | Shang Shang Typhoon | July 16, 1994\n | 86%[103] | 77[104] |\n| 1995\n | *Whisper of the Heart* | Yoshifumi Kondō | Hayao Miyazaki | Yuji Nomi | July 15, 1995\n | 94%[105] | 75[106] |\n| 1997\n | *Princess Mononoke* | Hayao Miyazaki | Joe Hisaishi | July 12, 1997\n | 93%[107] | 76[108] |\n| 1999\n | *My Neighbors the Yamadas* | Isao Takahata | Akiko Yano | July 17, 1999\n | 78%[109] | 75[110] |\n| 2001\n | *Spirited Away* | Hayao Miyazaki | Joe Hisaishi | July 20, 2001\n | 96%[111] | 96[112] |\n| 2002\n | *The Cat Returns* | Hiroyuki Morita | Reiko Yoshida | Toshio SuzukiNozomu Takahashi\n | Yuji Nomi | July 19, 2002\n | 88%[113] | 70[114] |\n| 2004\n | *Howl's Moving Castle* | Hayao Miyazaki | Toshio Suzuki | Joe Hisaishi | November 20, 2004\n | 87%[115] | 82[116] |\n| 2006\n | *Tales from Earthsea* | Gorō Miyazaki | Gorō MiyazakiKeiko Niwa\n | Tamiya Terashima\n | July 29, 2006\n | 38%[117] | 47[118] |\n| 2008\n | *Ponyo* | Hayao Miyazaki | Joe Hisaishi | July 19, 2008\n | 91%[119] | 86[120] |\n| 2010\n | *Arrietty* | Hiromasa Yonebayashi | Hayao MiyazakiKeiko Niwa\n | Cécile Corbel | July 17, 2010\n | 94%[121] | 80[122] |\n| 2011\n | *From Up on Poppy Hill* | Gorō Miyazaki | Satoshi Takebe | July 16, 2011\n | 87%[123] | 71[124] |\n| 2013\n | *The Wind Rises* | Hayao Miyazaki | Joe Hisaishi | July 20, 2013\n | 88%[125] | 83[126] |\n| *The Tale of the Princess Kaguya* | Isao Takahata | Isao TakahataRiko Sakaguchi\n | Yoshiaki Nishimura | November 23, 2013\n | 100%[127] | 89[128] |\n| 2014\n | *When Marnie Was There* | Hiromasa Yonebayashi | Hiromasa YonebayashiKeiko NiwaMasashi Ando | Takatsugu Muramatsu\n | July 19, 2014\n | 92%[129] | 72[130] |\n| 2016\n | *The Red Turtle* | Michaël Dudok de Wit | Michaël Dudok de WitPascale Ferran | Toshio SuzukiIsao TakahataVincent MaravalPascal CaucheteuxGrégoire Sorlat\n | Laurent Perez del Mar\n | May 18, 2016\n | 93%[131] | 86[132] |\n| 2020\n | *Earwig and the Witch* | Gorō Miyazaki | Keiko NiwaEmi Gunji\n | Toshio Suzuki\n | Satoshi Takebe\n | December 30, 2020[B]August 27, 2021[C] | 28%[133] | 46[134] |\n| 2023\n | *The Boy and the Heron* | Hayao Miyazaki | Joe Hisaishi | July 14, 2023\n | 98%[135] | 91[136] |\n\n\n1. **^** Originally broadcast on Nippon TV\n2. **^** First release on NHK General TV\n3. **^** Theatrical release\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Director\n | Screenwriter(s)\n | Producer(s)\n | Composer\n | Broadcast date\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1987\n | *The Story of Yanagawa's Canals* | Isao Takahata | Susumu Kubo\n | Michio Mamiya | August 15, 1987 (NHK)\n | Documentary\n |\n| 2014\n | *Ronja, the Robber's Daughter* | Gorō Miyazaki | Hiroyuki Kawasaki\n | Nobuo Kawakami\n | Satoshi Takebe | October 11, 2014–March 28, 2015 (NHK)\n | Anime television series based on *Ronia, the Robber's Daughter* by Astrid Lindgren |\n| 2022\n | *Zen – Grogu and Dust Bunnies*[137] | Katsuya Kondô\n |  | Tomohiko Ishii\n | Ludwig Göransson | November 12, 2022 (Disney+)\n | A *Star Wars* short film by Ghibli and Lucasfilm |\n\n\n## Style and themes[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Hayao Miyazaki § Themes\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**.

The films use traditional methods of making animation where every frame is drawn and colored by hand. Computer animation techniques are used sparingly.[138] All the Studio Ghibli films use bright colors,[139][140] and have a \"whimsical and joyful aesthetic\".[141] Studio Ghibli’s art style tends to be more of a cozy European style that put a lot of undertones on the background and nature in the scene.[142]\n\n\nThe films often focus on the lives of youth, especially school children. Common themes include the risks posed by progress to tradition,[143] environmentalism and the natural world,[143][141] independent female protagonists,[139] the cost of war, and youth.[140]\n\n\n\n## Criticism[edit]\n\n\nRayna Denison argues that, despite the feminist themes of Ghibli films, the studio has been reluctant to promote women within the company and regularly overworks its laborers, including on public holidays.[144]\n\n\nNathalie Pascaru and Maxim Tvorun-Dunn criticize the studio for what they see as the increasing commercialization of their films' iconography through plastic merchandise and tourist destinations, undermining the environmentalist themes of their films through industrial actions which are detrimental to the environment; as well as for turning their films' characters into decontextualized pop-culture references rather than multidimensional characters used to convey stories.[145]\n\n\n\n## Notable animators, background artists and character designers[edit]\n\n\n* Masashi Ando (*Paranoia Agent* and *Paprika*)\n* Makiko Futaki (*Akira*, *Angel's Egg*)\n* Katsuya Kondō (*Kiki's Delivery Service*, *Howl's Moving Castle*)\n* Kitarō Kōsaka (*Monster*, *Master Keaton*, and *Nasu*)\n* Kazuo Oga (*The Night of Taneyamagahara*, *My Neighbor Totoro*)\n* Kenichi Yoshida (*Overman King Gainer* and *Eureka Seven*)\n* Akihiko Yamashita (*Tide-Line Blue*, *Princess Nine*, *Strange Dawn*, and *Relic Armor Legacium*)\n* Hideaki Anno (*Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind*, *Neon Genesis Evangelion*)\n* Takashi Nakamura (*Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind*, *Akira*, *Robot Carnival* and *Catnapped!*)\n* Atsushi Takahashi (*Spirited Away*)\n* Takashi Watanabe (*Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind*, *Slayers*, *Boogiepop Phantom* and *Shakugan no Shana*)\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Anime and manga portal\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n* ![](image)Studio Ghibli portal\n* ![](image)Tokyo portal\n* ![icon](image)Animation portal\n* ![flag](image)Japan portal\n\n\n* Ghibli Museum in Mitaka, Tokyo\n* Ghibli Park in Nagakute, Aichi\n* Studio Kajino, a subsidiary of Studio Ghibli\n* Yasuo Ōtsuka\n* Studio Ponoc, founded by former members of Studio Ghibli\n* List of Japanese animation studios\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Home video rights are held by Wild Bunch subsidiary Wild Side, with Warner Bros.

StudioCanal UK formerly distributed Ghibli's films in the United Kingdom, until the contract ended following a lawsuit between them and Goodfellas in December 2022.
