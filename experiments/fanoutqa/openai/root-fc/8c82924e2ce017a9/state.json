Cecil B. DeMille (1932, 1947, 1949, 1952 and 1956) is in second place with five films and William Wyler (1942, 1946, 1959 and 1968) and James Cameron (1991, 1997, 2009 and 2022) are tied for third place with four films. D. W. Griffith (1915, 1916 and 1920), George Roy Hill (1966, 1969 and 1973) and the Russo brothers (2016, 2018 and 2019) all feature heavily with three films apiece. George Lucas directed two chart-toppers in 1977 and 1999, but also served in a strong creative capacity as a producer and writer in 1980, 1981, 1983, 1984 and 1989 as well. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | [# 3] |\n| 2021[97] | *Avatar* | $2,847,397,339 \u2021 | [# 1] |\n| *2022* | $2,923,706,026 \u2021 |\n\n\nRDistributor rental.\n\n\n\u2021Includes revenue from re-releases.

Disney films are usually co-directed and some directors have served on several winning teams: Wilfred Jackson, Hamilton Luske, Clyde Geronimi, David Hand, Ben Sharpsteen, Wolfgang Reitherman and Bill Roberts have all co-directed at least two films on the list. Only seven directors have topped the chart in consecutive years: McCarey (1944 and 1945), Nichols (1966 and 1967), Spielberg (1981 and 1982), Jackson (2002 and 2003), Verbinski (2006 and 2007) and the Russo brothers (2018 and 2019).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAt least eleven films have held the record of 'highest-grossing film' since *The Birth of a Nation* assumed the top spot in 1915. Both *The Birth of a Nation* and *Gone with the Wind* spent twenty-five consecutive years apiece as the highest-grosser, with films directed by Steven Spielberg and James Cameron holding the record on three occasions each. Spielberg became the first director to break his own record when *Jurassic Park* overtook *E.T.*, and Cameron emulated the feat when *Avatar* broke the record set by *Titanic*. When it took over the top spot in 2019, *Avengers: Endgame* became the first sequel to hold the record of highest-grossing film, and in doing so interrupted thirty-six years of Spielberg/Cameron dominance before *Avatar* reclaimed the top spot two years later in 2021 upon a re-release.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Pincus-Roth, Zachary (January 8, 2006). \"Movies aren't the only B.O. monsters\". *Variety*.

Besides the *Star Wars* and *Superman* franchises, *James Bond* and *Godzilla* films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then *Gone with the Wind*\u2014which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years\u2014is still the highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n## Highest-grossing films[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | [# 44][# 45] |\n| 26\n | 10\n | *Minions* | $1,159,444,662\n | 2015\n | [# 46][# 16] |\n| 27\n | 12\n | *Captain America: Civil War* | $1,153,337,496\n | 2016\n | [# 47][# 48] |\n| 28\n | 20\n | *Aquaman* | $1,148,528,393\n | 2018\n | [# 49][# 12] |\n| 29\n | 2\n | *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* | $1,147,997,407\n | 2003\n | [# 50][# 51] |\n| 30\n | 24RK | *Spider-Man: Far From Home* | $1,131,927,996\n | 2019\n | [# 52][# 4] |\n| 31\n | 23RK | *Captain Marvel* | $1,128,274,794\n | 2019\n | [# 53][# 54] |\n| 32\n | 5RK | *Transformers: Dark of the Moon* | $1,123,794,079\n | 2011\n | [# 55][# 34] |\n| 33\n | 7\n | *Skyfall* | $1,108,569,499\n | 2012\n | [# 56][# 57] |\n| 34\n | 10\n | *Transformers: Age of Extinction* | $1,104,054,072\n | 2014\n | [# 58][# 59] |\n| 35\n | 7\n | *The Dark Knight Rises* | $1,081,169,825\n | 2012\n | [# 60][# 61] |\n| 36\n | 31\n | *Joker* | $1,074,458,282\n | 2019\n | [# 62][# 25] |\n| 37\n | 32\n | *Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker* | $1,074,144,248\n | 2019\n | [# 63][# 25] |\n| 38\n | 30\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n74. **^** Kr\u00e4mer, Peter (1999). \"Women First: Titanic, Action-Adventure Films, and Hollywood's Female Audience\".

There is strong interest in the superhero genre, with ten films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe featuring among the nominal top-earners. The most successful superhero film, *Avengers: Endgame*, is also the second-highest-grossing film on the nominal earnings chart, and there are four films in total based on the *Avengers* comic books charting in the top twenty. Other Marvel Comics adaptations have also had success with the *Spider-Man* and *X-Men* properties, while films based on *Batman* and *Superman* from DC Comics have generally performed well. *Star Wars* is also represented in the nominal earnings chart with five films, while the *Jurassic Park* franchise features prominently. Although the nominal earnings chart is dominated by films adapted from pre-existing properties and sequels, it is headed by *Avatar*, which is an original work. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *Lightyear* (2022) | $226,425,420\n |  |\n\n |\n\n |\n\n\nSShared universes for which some properties also have their own entries.\n\n\n\\*Canada and U.S. gross only.\n\n\nRDistributor rental.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Film portal\n\n\n* Lists of highest-grossing films\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Prior to the release of *Spectre* in 2015, the James Bond series had grossed approximately $17.7\u00a0billion at 2015 prices;[111] after factoring in earnings of over $1.6 billion from *Spectre* and *No Time to Die*, the series has earned at least $19.3\u00a0billion adjusted for inflation.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBecause of release schedules\u2014especially in the case of films released towards the end of the year\u2014and different release patterns across the world, many films can do business in two or more calendar years; therefore the grosses documented here are not confined to just the year of release. Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 6\n | *Avengers* | $7,767,486,137\n | 4\n | $1,941,871,534\n | *Endgame* ($2,797,501,328)\n |\n| 1\n | *Endgame* (2019) | $2,797,501,328 |\n| 2\n | *Infinity War* (2018) | $2,048,359,754 |\n| 3\n | *The Avengers* (2012) | $1,518,815,515 |\n| 4\n | *Age of Ultron* (2015) | $1,402,809,540\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 7\n | *Fast & Furious* | $7,333,501,460\n | 11\n | $666,681,951\n | *Furious 7* ($1,515,341,399)\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *Fantastic Beasts *series** | $1,876,045,253\n | 3\n | $625,348,418\n | *Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them* ($814,038,508)\n |\n| 1\n | *Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them* (2016) | $814,038,508 |\n| 2\n | *The Crimes of Grindelwald* (2018) | $654,855,901 |\n| 3\n | *The Secrets of Dumbledore* (2022) | $407,150,844\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 5\n | *James Bond* | $7,836,485,924\n | 27\n | $290,240,219\n | *Skyfall* ($1,108,569,499)\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Eon series | $7,634,741,206\n | 25\n | $305,389,648\n | *Skyfall* ($1,108,569,499)\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n13. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

Since the Cinerama corporation owned the theaters there were no rental fees for the films, meaning the studio received 100% of the box-office gross, unlike the case with most other films where the distributor typically receives less than half the gross. Since *Variety* at the time ranked films by their U.S. and Canadian rental, they constructed a hypothetical rental figure for the Cinerama films to provide a basis for comparison to other films in their chart: in the case of *This Is Cinerama*, the $50\u00a0million worldwide gross was reconfigured as a $12.5\u00a0million U.S. rental gross; this is exactly 25% of the amount reported by Cinerama, so *Variety*'s formula seemingly halved the gross to obtain an estimate for the U.S. share, and halved it again to simulate a rental fee.[62] All five Cinerama features collectively generated $120\u00a0million in worldwide box office receipts.[63]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* *Cleopatra*: \"Domestic Rentals: $0.5; Production Cost: $0.3 (Unadjusted $s in Millions of $s).\"\n88. **^** Birchard, Robert S.

The total for *Avatar*'s first appearance on the chart includes revenue from the 2010 Special Edition, which represents all of its earnings up to the point it relinquished the record, whereas its second appearance also incorporates revenue from a 2020 re-release in the Asia-Pacific region as well as the 2021 re-release in China which helped it to reclaim the record. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* Original release: \"Back to the Future (1985)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

the claim, the sum has been widely reported even though it has never been substantiated.[65] While it is generally accepted that *Gone with the Wind* took over the record of highest-grossing film on its initial release\u2014which is true in terms of public exhibition\u2014it is likely it did not overtake *The Birth of a Nation* in total revenue until a much later date, with it still being reported as the highest earner up until the 1960s.[73] *Gone with the Wind* itself may have been briefly overtaken by *The Ten Commandments* (1956), which closed at the end of 1960 with worldwide

Commonly mistaken for home video revenue, distributor rentals are the distributor's share of the film's theatrical revenue (i.e. the box office gross less the exhibitor's cut).[41][42] Historically, the rental price averaged at 30\u201340% when the distributors owned the theater chains, equating to just over a third of the gross being paid to the distributor of the film.[43] In the modern marketplace, rental fees can vary greatly\u2014depending on a number of factors\u2014although the films from the major studios average out at 43%.[41]\n> \n> \n> \n>\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nInfInflation adjustment is carried out using the Consumer price index for advanced economies published by the International Monetary Fund.[36] The index is uniformly applied to the grosses in the chart published by *Guinness World Records* in 2014, beginning with the 2014 index. The figures in the above chart take into account inflation that occurred in 2014, and in every available year since then, through 2022.\n\n\nA1The adjusted gross for *Avatar* includes revenue from the original release and all four reissues. The original release and 2010 Special Edition grosses are adjusted from the Guinness base year, whilst the 2020 and 2021 grosses are adjusted from the 2021 index and the 2022 gross from 2022.[37]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ \"Catwoman (2004)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

This became its standard policy in 1940, when the advent of war in Europe persuaded the American film industry (temporarily, as it turned out) that it should be wholly reliant on the home market for profitability. Where specific rentals data are reported in *Variety* before this (which tended to be only sporadically) they were often for worldwide rather domestic performance. This was also the case with other trade sources, such as *Quigley*'s annual *Motion Picture Almanac*, which published its own all-time hits lists from the early 1930s onward. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe main argument against this figure is that it simply did not have a wide enough release to sustain the sort of sums that would be required for it to ultimately gross this amount.[83] Exact figures are not known, but testimony in a federal trial in 1976\u2014about four years into the film's release\u2014showed the film had grossed over $25\u00a0million.[84] Roger Ebert has reasoned it possibly did earn as much as $600\u00a0million on paper, since mobsters owned most of the adult movie theaters during this period and would launder income from drugs and prostitution through them, so probably inflated the box-office receipts for the film.[85]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAnother film purported to have been the highest-grosser is the 1972 pornographic film *Deep Throat*.

It was the biggest hit of its kind, and remained in continual distribution until the 1970s when hardcore pornography eventually took over. At the end of 1947 it had earned $2\u00a0million, and by 1949, $8\u00a0million; by 1956 it had earned $22\u00a0million in rentals, representing a gross of $80\u00a0million, and would have easily placed in the top ten films in the late 1940s and early 1950s.

Contemporary accounts often list it as earning $32\u00a0million in North American rentals and retrospective charts have often duplicated this claim; however, it is likely this was the worldwide rental figure. Trade journals would collate the data by either obtaining it from the distributors themselves, who were keen to promote a successful film, or by surveying theaters and constructing an estimate. Distributors would often report the worldwide rental since the higher figure made the film appear more successful, while estimates were limited to performance in North America; therefore it was not unusual for worldwide and North American rentals to be mixed up. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n151. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"A Guy Named Joe (1944) \u2013 Notes\".

A major figure in the post-New Hollywood era, Cameron is considered one of the industry's most innovative filmmakers, regularly making use of novel technologies with a classical filmmaking style. He first gained recognition for writing and directing *The Terminator* (1984) and found further success with *Aliens* (1986), *The Abyss* (1989), *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* (1991), and the action comedy *True Lies* (1994). He wrote and directed *Titanic* (1997), *Avatar* (2009) and its sequels, with *Titanic* earning him Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Film Editing. A recipient of various other industry accolades, two of his films have been selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress.\n\n\nCameron co-founded the production companies Lightstorm Entertainment, Digital Domain, and Earthship Productions. In addition to filmmaking, he is a National Geographic sea tourist and has produced many documentaries on the subject, including *Ghosts of the Abyss* (2003) and *Aliens of the Deep* (2005). Cameron has also contributed to underwater filming and remote vehicle technologies and helped create the digital 3D Fusion Camera System. In 2012, Cameron became the first person to do a solo descent to the bottom of the Mariana Trench, the deepest part of the Earth's ocean, in the *Deepsea Challenger* submersible.\n\n\nCameron's films have grossed over $8\u00a0billion worldwide, making him the second-highest-grossing film director of all time. Three of Cameron's films are amongst the top four highest-grossing films of all time; *Avatar* (2009), *Avatar: The Way of Water* (2022) and *Titanic* (1997) are the highest, third-highest and fourth-highest-grossing films of all time, respectively.[1] Cameron directed the first film to gross over $1\u00a0billion, the first two films to gross over $2\u00a0billion, and is the only director to have had three films gross over $2 billion.[2][3] In 2010, *Time* named Cameron one of the 100 most influential people in the world. Cameron is also an environmentalist and runs several sustainability businesses.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nJames Francis Cameron[4] was born on August 16, 1954, in Kapuskasing, Ontario, to Philip Cameron, an electrical engineer, and Shirley (n\u00e9e\u00a0Lowe), an artist and nurse.[5] He is the first of five children, with two brothers and two sisters.[5] His paternal great-great-great-grandfather emigrated from Balquhidder, Scotland, in 1825.[5] Cameron spent summers on his grandfather's farm in southern Ontario.[6] He attended Stamford Collegiate in Niagara Falls. At age 17, Cameron and his family moved from Chippawa to Brea, California.[7] He attended Sonora High School and then moved to Brea Olinda High School. Classmates recalled that he was not a sportsman but instead enjoyed building things that \"either went up into the air or into the deep\".[8]\n\n\nAfter high school, Cameron enrolled at Fullerton College, a community college in 1973 to study physics. He switched subjects to English, but left the college at the end of 1974.[9] Cameron worked odd jobs, including as a truck driver and a high school janitor, drank beer, smoked cannabis and did a lot of LSD, but wrote in his free time.[10][11] During this period, he learned about special effects by reading other students' work on \"optical printing, or front screen projection, or dye transfers, anything that related to film technology\" at the library.[12] After the excitement of seeing *Star Wars* in 1977, Cameron quit his job as a truck driver to enter the film industry.[13]\n\n\n\n## Film career[edit]\n\n\n### Early work and 1980s[edit]\n\n\n![Cameron in September 1986](image)Cameron, September 1986\nCameron's directing career began in 1978.[14] After borrowing money from a consortium of dentists, he learned to direct, write and produce his first short film, *Xenogenesis* (1978) with a friend.[15] Learning as they went, Cameron said he felt like a doctor doing his first surgical procedure.[12] He then served as a production assistant for *Rock 'n' Roll High School* (1979). While educating himself about filmmaking techniques, Cameron started a job as a miniature model maker at Roger Corman Studios.[11][16] He was soon employed as an art director for the science-fiction film *Battle Beyond the Stars* (1980). He carried out the special effects for John Carpenter's *Escape from New York* (1981), served as production designer for *Galaxy of Terror* (1981), and consulted on the design for *Android* (1982).\n\n\nCameron was hired as the special effects director for the sequel to *Piranha* (1978), titled *Piranha II: The Spawning* in 1982. The original director, Miller Drake, left the project due to creative differences with producer Ovidio Assonitis. Shot in Rome, Italy and on Grand Cayman, the film gave Cameron the opportunity to become director for a major film for the first time. However, Cameron later said that it did not feel like his first film due to power-struggles with Assonitis.[17] Disillusioned from being in Rome and suffering a fever, Cameron had a nightmare about an invincible robot hit-man sent from the future to assassinate him, which later led to the inspiration of *The Terminator*.[18] Upon release of *Piranha II: The Spawning*, critics were not impressed; author Tim Healey called it \"a marvellously bad movie which splices clich\u00e9s from every conceivable source\".[19]\n\n\nInspired by John Carpenter's horror film *Halloween* (1978),[20] in 1982, Cameron wrote the script for *The Terminator* (1984), a sci-fi action film about a cyborg sent from the future to carry out a lethal mission. Cameron wanted to sell the script so that he could direct the movie. Whilst some film studios expressed interest in the project, many executives were unwilling to let a new and unfamiliar director make the movie. Gale Anne Hurd, a colleague and founder of Pacific Western Productions, agreed to buy Cameron's script for one dollar, on the condition that Cameron direct the film. He convinced the president of Hemdale Pictures to make the film, with Cameron as director and Hurd as a producer. Lance Henriksen, who starred in *Piranha II: The Spawning*, was considered for the lead role, but Cameron decided that Arnold Schwarzenegger was more suitable as the cyborg villain due to his bodybuilder appearance.[21] Henriksen was given a smaller role instead. Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton also joined the cast. *The Terminator* was a box office success, exceeding expectations set by Orion Pictures.[21] The film proved popular with audiences and earned over $78\u00a0million worldwide.[22] George Perry of the BBC praised Cameron's direction, writing \"Cameron laces the action with ironic jokes, but never lets up on hinting that the terror may strike at any moment\".[23] In 2008, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry, being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".[24]\n\n\nIn 1984, Cameron was hired to write a sequel to *First Blood*; it was rewritten by Sylvester Stallone and released as *Rambo: First Blood Part II*.[25][26] Cameron was then hired to write and direct a sequel to *Alien* (1979), a science fiction horror film directed by Ridley Scott. Like the original, the sequel *Aliens* (1986) featured Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley. *Aliens* follows Ripley as she helps a group of marines fight off extraterrestrials. Despite conflicts with cast and crew during production, and having to replace one of the lead actors \u2014 James Remar with Michael Biehn \u2014 *Aliens* was a box office success, generating over $130\u00a0million worldwide.[27] The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards in 1987; Best Actress, Best Art Direction, Best Film Editing, Best Original Score and Best Sound. It won awards for Best Sound Editing and Best Visual Effects.[28] In addition, Weaver and the film made the cover of *Time* in July 1986.[29]\n\n\n\n![Cameron with Gale Anne Hurd, 1986](image)Cameron with Gale Anne Hurd, 1986\nAfter *Aliens*, Cameron and Gale Anne Hurd decided to make *The Abyss*, a story about oil-rig workers who discover strange intelligent life in the ocean. Based on an idea which Cameron had conceived of during high school, the film was initially budgeted at $41\u00a0million, although it ran considerably over this amount. It starred Ed Harris, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Michael Biehn. The production process began in the Cayman Islands and in South Carolina, inside the building of an unfinished nuclear power plant with two huge water tanks.[30] The cast and crew recall Cameron's dictatorial behavior, and the filming of water scenes which were mentally and physically exhausting.[31] Upon the film's release, *The Abyss* was praised for its special effects, and earned $90\u00a0million at the worldwide box office.[32] *The Abyss* received four Academy Award nominations, and won Best Visual Effects.[33]\n\n\n\n### 1990s[edit]\n\n\nIn 1990, Cameron co-founded the firm Lightstorm Entertainment with partner Lawrence Kasanoff. In 1991, Cameron served as executive producer for *Point Break* (1991), directed by Kathryn Bigelow. After the success of *The Terminator*, there were discussions for a sequel, and by the late 1980s, Mario Kassar of Carolco Pictures secured the rights to the sequel, allowing Cameron to begin production of the film, *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* (1991). Written by Cameron and William Wisher Jr., Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton reprise their roles. The story follows on from *Terminator*, depicting a new villain (T-1000), with shape-shifting abilities who hunts for Sarah Connor's son, John (Edward Furlong). Cameron cast Robert Patrick as T-1000 because of his lean and thin appearance \u2014 a sharp contrast to Schwarzenegger. Cameron explained: \"I wanted someone who was extremely fast and agile. If the T-800 is a human Panzer tank, then the T-1000 is a Porsche\".[34] *Terminator 2* was one of the most expensive films to be produced, costing at least $94\u00a0million[35] ($210\u00a0million in 2023[36]). Despite the challenging use of computer-generated imagery (CGI), the film was completed on time and released on July 3, 1991. *Terminator 2* broke box office records (including the opening weekend record for an R-rated film), earning over $200\u00a0million in North America and being the first to earn over $300\u00a0million worldwide[37] (respectively over $447\u00a0million and $671\u00a0million in 2023[36]). It won four Academy Awards: Best Makeup, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing and Best Visual Effects. It also received nominations for Best Cinematography and Best Film Editing, but lost both to political thriller *JFK* (1991).[38]\n\n\nIn subsequent years, Cameron planned to do a third *Terminator* film, but plans never materialized. The rights to the *Terminator* franchise were eventually purchased by Kassar from a bankruptcy sale of Carolco's assets.[39] Cameron moved on to other projects and, in 1993, co-founded Digital Domain, a visual effects production company. In 1994, Cameron and Schwarzenegger reunited for their third collaboration, *True Lies,* a remake of the 1991 French comedy *La Totale!* The story depicts an American secret agent who leads a double life as a married man, whose wife believes he is a computer salesman. The film co-stars Jamie Lee Curtis, Eliza Dushku and Tom Arnold. Cameron's Lightstorm Entertainment signed a deal with 20th Century Fox for the production of *True Lies*. Budgeted at a minimum of $100\u00a0million, the film earned $146\u00a0million in the United States and Canada.[40][41] The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects and Curtis won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress.[42][43] In 1995, Cameron co-produced *Strange Days*, a science fiction thriller. Directed by Kathryn Bigelow and co-written by Jay Cocks, *Strange Days* was critically and financially unsuccessful.[44] In 1996, Cameron reunited with the cast of *Terminator 2* to film *T2 3-D: Battle Across Time*, an attraction at Universal Studios Florida, and in other parks around the world.[45]\n\n\nHis next major project was *Titanic* (1997), an epic about RMS\u00a0*Titanic*, which sank in 1912 after striking an iceberg. With a production budget of $200\u00a0million, at the time it was the most expensive film ever made. Starting in 1995, Cameron took several dives to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean to capture footage of the wreck, which would later be used in the film.[46] A replica of the ship was built in Rosarito Beach and principal photography began in September 1996. *Titanic* made headlines before its release, for being over-budget and exceeding its schedule.[47][48] Cameron's completed screenplay depicts two star-crossed lovers, portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, from different social classes who fall in love amid the backdrop of the tragedy; a radical departure from his previous work. The supporting cast includes Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Gloria Stuart, Bernard Hill, Jonathan Hyde, Victor Garber, Danny Nucci, David Warner and Bill Paxton.\n\n\n\n![Cameron promoting Avatar during the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con](image)Cameron promoting *Avatar* at the San Diego Comic-Con, 2009\nAfter months of delay, *Titanic* premiered on December 19, 1997. The film received strong critical acclaim and became the highest-grossing film of all time, holding this position for twelve years, until Cameron's *Avatar* beat the record in 2010.[49] The costumes and sets were praised, and *The Washington Post* considered the CGI graphics to be spectacular.[50][51] *Titanic* received a record-tie of fourteen nominations (tied with *All About Eve* (1950)) at the 1998 Academy Awards. It won eleven of the awards, tying the record for most wins with 1959's *Ben-Hur*, and 2003's *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King*, including: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Costume Design, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing, Best Original Score and Best Original Song.[52] Upon receiving Best Picture, Cameron and producer Jon Landau asked for a moment of silence to remember the 1,500 people who died when the ship sank.[53] Film critic Roger Ebert praised Cameron's storytelling, writing: \"It is flawlessly crafted, intelligently constructed, strongly acted, and spellbinding\".[54] Authors Kevin Sandler and Gaylyn Studlar wrote in 1999 that the romance, historical nostalgia and James Horner's music contributed to the film's cultural phenomenon.[55] In 2017, on its 20th anniversary, *Titanic* became Cameron's second film to be selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.[56]\n\n\nAfter the huge success of *Titanic*, Cameron kept a low profile. In 1998, he and his brother, John, formed Earthship Productions, to stream documentaries about the deep sea, one of Cameron's interests.[57][58] He had planned to make a film about Spider-Man, a project developed by Menahem Golan of Cannon Films. Columbia hired David Koepp to adapt Cameron's ideas into a screenplay, but due to various disagreements, Cameron abandoned the project.[59] In 2002, *Spider-Man* was released with the screenplay credited solely to Koepp.[60]\n\n\n\n### 2000s[edit]\n\n\nIn 2000, Cameron made his debut in television and co-created *Dark Angel* with Charles H. Eglee, a television series influenced by cyberpunk, biopunk, contemporary superheroes and third-wave feminism. *Dark Angel* starred Jessica Alba as Max Guevara, a genetically enhanced super-soldier created by a secretive organization. While the first season was moderately successful, the second season did less well, which led to its cancellation.[61]\n\n\nIn 2002, Cameron served as producer on the 2002 film *Solaris*, a science fiction drama directed by Steven Soderbergh. The film gained mixed reviews and failed at the box office.[62][63] Keen to make documentaries, Cameron directed *Expedition: Bismarck*, about the German Battleship *Bismarck*. In 2003, he directed *Ghosts of the Abyss*, a documentary about RMS *Titanic* which was released by Walt Disney Pictures and Walden Media, and designed for 3D theaters. Cameron told *The Guardian* his intention for filming everything in 3D.[64] In 2005, Cameron co-directed *Aliens of the Deep*, a documentary about the various forms of life in the ocean. He also starred in *Titanic Adventure* with Tony Robinson*,* another documentary about the *Titanic* shipwreck. In 2006, Cameron co-created and narrated *The Exodus Decoded*, a documentary exploring the Biblical account of the Exodus. In 2007, Cameron and fellow director Simcha Jacobovici, produced *The Lost Tomb of Jesus*. It was broadcast on Discovery Channel on March 4, 2007; the documentary was controversial for arguing that the Talpiot Tomb was the burial place of Jesus of Nazareth.[65][66]\n\n\n\n![Cameron speaking at a TED talk in February 2010](image)Cameron speaking at a TED talk, February 2010\nBy the mid-2000s, Cameron returned to directing and producing another mainstream film since *Titanic*. Cameron had displayed interest in making *Avatar* (2009) and *Alita: Battle Angel* (2019) as early as June 2005, with both films to be shot using 3D technology.[67] He wanted to make *Alita: Battle Angel* first, followed by *Avatar*, but switched the order in February 2006. Although Cameron had written an 80-page treatment for *Avatar* in 1995, Cameron stated that he wanted the necessary technology to improve before starting production.[68][69] *Avatar*, with the story line set in the mid-22nd century, had an estimated budget in excess of $300\u00a0million. The cast includes Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Stephen Lang, Michelle Rodriguez and Sigourney Weaver. It was composed with a mix of live-action footage and computer-generated animation, using an advanced version of the performance capture technique, previously used by director Robert Zemeckis in *The Polar Express*.[70] Cameron intended *Avatar* to be 3D-only but decided to adapt it for conventional viewing as well.[71]\n\n\nIntended for release in May 2009, *Avatar* premiered on December 18, 2009. This delay allowed more time for post-production and the opportunity for theaters to install 3D projectors.[72] *Avatar* broke several box office records during its initial theatrical run. It grossed $749.7\u00a0million in the United States and Canada and more than $2.74\u00a0billion worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing film of all time in the United States and Canada, surpassing *Titanic*.[73] It was the first film to earn more than $2\u00a0billion worldwide. *Avatar* was nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, and won three: Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography and Best Visual Effects.[74] In July 2010, an extended theatrical re-release generated an additional $33.2\u00a0million worldwide (equivalent to $45,300,000 in 2023) at the box office. In his mixed review, Sukhdev Sandhu of *The Telegraph* complimented the 3D, but opined that Cameron \"should have been more brutal in his editing\".[75] That year, *Vanity Fair* reported that Cameron's earnings were US$257\u00a0million, making him the highest earner in Hollywood.[76] As of 2022, *Avatar* and *Titanic* hold the achievement for being the first two of the six films in history to gross over $2\u00a0billion worldwide.[77]\n\n\n\n### 2010s and 2020s[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cameron in October 2012\nIn 2011, Cameron served as an executive producer for *Sanctum*, a disaster-survival film about a cave diving expedition which turns deadly. Although receiving mixed reviews, the film earned a fair $108\u00a0million at the worldwide box office.[78] Cameron re-investigated the sinking of RMS *Titanic* with eight experts in a 2012 TV documentary special, *Titanic: The Final Word with James Cameron*, which premiered on April 8 on the National Geographic channel.[79] In the feature, the experts revised the CGI animation of the sinking conceived in 1995.[80][81] In March 2010, Cameron announced that *Titanic* will be converted and re-released in 3D to commemorate the centennial anniversary of the tragedy.[82] On March 27, 2012, *Titanic* 3D premiered at London's Royal Albert Hall.[83] He also served as executive producer of *Cirque du Soleil: Worlds Away* and *Deepsea Challenge 3D* in 2012 and 2014, respectively.[84][85]\n\n\nCameron starred in the 2017 documentary *Atlantis Rising,* with collaborator Simcha Jacobovici. The pair go on an adventure to explore the existence of the city of Atlantis. The programme aired on January 29 on National Geographic.[86] Next, Cameron produced and appeared in a documentary about the history of science fiction. *James Cameron's Story of Science Fiction,* the six-episodic series was broadcast on AMC in 2018.[87] The series featured interviews with guests including Ridley Scott, Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and Christopher Nolan.[88] He stated \"Without Jules Verne and H. G. Wells, there wouldn't have been Ray Bradbury or Robert A. Heinlein, and without them, there wouldn't be [George] Lucas, [Steven] Spielberg, Ridley Scott or me\".[89]\n\n\n*Alita: Battle Angel* was finally released in 2019, after being in parallel development with *Avatar*. Written by Cameron and friend Jon Landau, the film was directed by Robert Rodriguez and produced by Cameron.[90] The film is based on a 1990s Japanese manga series *Battle Angel Alita,* depicting a cyborg who cannot remember anything of her past life and tries to uncover the truth. Produced with similar techniques and technology as in *Avatar,* the film starred Rosa Salazar, Christoph Waltz, Jennifer Connelly, Mahershala Ali, Ed Skrein, Jackie Earle Haley and Keean Johnson. The film premiered on January 31, 2019, to generally positive reviews and $404\u00a0million (equivalent to $474,900,000 in 2023) at the worldwide box office.[91] In her review, Monica Castillo of *RogerEbert.com* called it \"an awe-inspiring jump for [Rodriguez]\" and \"a visual bonanza\", despite the bulky script.[92] Cameron then returned to the *Terminator* franchise as producer and writer for Tim Miller's *Terminator: Dark Fate* (2019).[93]\n\n\nIn August 2013, Cameron announced plans to direct three sequels to *Avatar* simultaneously, for release in December 2016, 2017, and 2018.[94] However, the release dates were adjusted due to Cameron's other priorities, with *Avatar* *3*, *4* and *5* to be released, respectively, on December 20, 2024, December 18, 2026, and December 22, 2028.[95] *Deadline Hollywood* estimated that the budget for these would be over $1\u00a0billion.[96] *Avatar 2* (later given the subtitle *The Way of Water)* and *Avatar 3* began simultaneous production in Manhattan Beach, California on August 15, 2017. Principal photography began in New Zealand on September 25, 2017.[97][98][99][100][101][102] Parts of *Avatar 4* were also filmed during this time.[103] Cameron stated in a 2017 interview: \"Let's face it, if *Avatar 2* and *3* don't make enough money, there's not going to be a *4* and *5*\".[104] *Avatar: The Way of Water* had its world premiere in London on December 6, 2022.[105] It became the highest grossing film released in 2022, and as of 2023 stood as the 3rd highest grossing film of all time, behind only *Avatar* and *Avengers: Endgame*, and just ahead of *Titanic*.[106][107]\n\n\nLightstorm Entertainment bought the film rights to the Taylor Stevens novel, *The Informationist,* a thriller set in Africa with Cameron planning to direct.[108] In 2010, he indicated he would adapt the Charles R. Pellegrino book *The Last Train from Hiroshima,* which is about the survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Cameron met with survivor Tsutomu Yamaguchi before his death in 2010.[109]\n\n\n\n## Activism and deep-sea exploration[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2012, Cameron and his family have adopted a vegan diet.[110][111] Cameron states that \"by changing what you eat, you will change the entire contract between the human species and the natural world\".[112] He and his wife are advocates of plant-based food and have called for constructive actions to produce more plant-based food and less meat to mitigate the impact of climate change.[113] In 2006, Cameron's wife co-founded MUSE School, which became the first K-12 vegan school in the United States.[114] He has also hosted events for Global Green USA, and pushed for sustainable solutions to energy use.[115]\n\n\nIn early 2014, Cameron purchased the Beaufort Vineyard and Estate Winery in Courtenay, British Columbia for $2.7\u00a0million (equivalent to $3,423,000 in 2023), to pursue his passion for sustainable agribusiness.[116] He sold the vineyard in 2020.[117][118] In June 2019, Cameron announced a business venture with film director Peter Jackson, to produce plant-based meat, cheese and dairy products in New Zealand. He suggested that we need \"a nice transition to a meatless or relatively meatless world in 20 or 30 years\".[119] In 2012, Cameron purchased more than 1,000 hectares (2,500 acres) of land in remote South Wairarapa, New Zealand; subsequent purchases have seen that grow to approximately 5,000 hectares. The Camerons grow a range of organic fruit, nuts and vegetables on the land. Nearby in Greytown, they run a caf\u00e9 and grocery store, Forest Food Organics, selling produce from their land.[120][121][122]\n\n\nIn June 2010, Cameron met with officials of the Environmental Protection Agency to discuss possible solutions to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. It was reported that he offered his assistance to help stop the oil well from leaking.[123][124] He is a member of the NASA Advisory Council and he worked with the space agency to build cameras for the Curiosity rover sent for Mars.[125] NASA launched the rover without Cameron's technology due to a lack of time during testing.[126] He has expressed interest in a project about Mars, stating: \"I've been very interested in the Humans to Mars movement ... and I've done a tremendous amount of personal research for a novel, a miniseries, and a 3D film.\"[127] Cameron is a member of the Mars Society, a non-profit organization lobbying for the colonization of Mars.[128][129] Cameron endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton for the 2016 United States presidential election.[130]\n\n\n\n### Deep-sea exploration[edit]\n\n\nCameron has experience with deep-sea exploration, in part because of his work on *The Abyss* and *Titanic*,[123] and his childhood fascination with shipwrecks. He has contributed to advancements in underwater filming and remotely operated vehicles, and helped develop the 3D Fusion Camera System.[131][132][133] In 2011, Cameron became a National Geographic explorer-in-residence.[134] In this role, on March 7, 2012, he dived five miles deep to the bottom of the New Britain Trench with the *Deepsea Challenger*.[135] 19 days later, Cameron reached the Challenger Deep, the deepest part of the Mariana Trench.[136][137][138] He spent more than three hours exploring the ocean floor, becoming the first to accomplish the trip alone.[136][139] During his dive to the Challenger Deep, he discovered new species of sea cucumber, squid worm and a giant single-celled amoeba.[140] He was preceded by unmanned dives in 1995 and 2009, as well as by Jacques Piccard and Don Walsh, the first men to reach the bottom of the Mariana Trench aboard the Bathyscaphe Trieste in 1960.[141]\n\n\nIn the aftermath of the *Titan* submersible implosion, Cameron made appearances in multiple news outlets where he criticized OceanGate and its co-founder Stockton Rush for failing to certify the company's submersibles for safety. He was also critical of the use of carbon-fiber composite in the company's Titan submersible, stating that the material has \"no strength in external compression\" when withstanding the pressure in deep-sea environments.[142][143] On July 15, Cameron stated that he had no plans for an OceanGate documentary.[144]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nCameron has been married five times.[145] He was married to Sharon Williams from 1978 to 1984. A year after he and Williams divorced, Cameron married film producer Gale Anne Hurd, a close collaborator for his 1980s films. They divorced in 1989. Soon after separating from Hurd, Cameron met the director Kathryn Bigelow, whom he wed in 1989; they divorced in 1991. Cameron then began a relationship with Linda Hamilton, the lead actress in *The Terminator* series. Their daughter was born in 1993. Cameron married Hamilton in 1997. Amid speculation of an affair between Cameron and actress Suzy Amis, Cameron and Hamilton separated after two years of marriage, with Hamilton receiving a settlement of $50\u00a0million.[146][147][148] He married Amis, his fifth wife, in 2000. They have one son and two daughters together.[115]\n\n\nCameron applied for American citizenship in 2004, but withdrew his application after George W. Bush won the presidential election.[149] Cameron resided in the United States, but after filming *Avatar* in New Zealand, Cameron bought a home and a farm there in 2012.[150][151][152] He divided his time between Malibu, California and New Zealand until 2020,[153] after which he sold his Malibu home and decided to live in New Zealand permanently.[154] He said in August 2020: \"I plan to make all my future films in New Zealand, and I see the country having an opportunity to demonstrate to the international film industry how to safely return to work. Doing so with *Avatar* [sequels] will be a beacon that, when this is over [COVID-19 pandemic], will attract more production to New Zealand and continue to stimulate the screen industry and the economy for years.\"[155][156]\n\n\nCameron is an atheist; he formerly associated himself with agnosticism, a stance he said he had come to see as \"cowardly atheism.\"[57] Cameron met close friend Guillermo del Toro on the production of his 1993 film, *Cronos*.[157] In 1998, del Toro's father was kidnapped in Guadalajara and Cameron gave del Toro more than $1\u00a0million (equivalent to $1,744,000 in 2023) in cash to pay a ransom and have his father released.[157][158][159] Cameron had been friends with *Titanic* expert Paul-Henri Nargeolet for over 25 years before the latter's death.[160]\n\n\nIn June 2013, British artist Roger Dean filed a copyright complaint against Cameron, seeking damages of $50\u00a0million (equivalent to $64,500,000 in 2023).[161] Relating to *Avatar*, Cameron was accused of \"wilful and deliberate copying, dissemination and exploitation\" of Dean's original images; the case was dismissed by US district judge Jesse Furman in 2014.[162] In 2016, Premier Exhibitions, owner of many RMS *Titanic* artifacts, filed for bankruptcy. Cameron supported the UK's National Maritime Museum and National Museums Northern Ireland decision to bid for the artifacts, but they were acquired by an investment group before a formal bid took place.[163][164]\n\n\n\n## Filmmaking style[edit]\n\n\n### Themes[edit]\n\n\nCameron's films are often based on themes which explore the conflicts between intelligent machines and humanity or nature,[165][166] dangers of corporate greed,[167] strong female characters, and a romance subplot.[168] Cameron has further stated in an interview with The Talks, \"All my movies are love stories.\"[169] Both *Titanic* and *Avatar* are noted for featuring star-crossed lovers.[170] Characters suffering from emotionally intense and dramatic environments in the sea wilderness are explored in *The Abyss* and *Titanic. The* *Terminator* series amplifies technology as an enemy which could lead to devastation of mankind. Similarly, *Avatar* views tribal people as an honest group, whereas a \"technologically advanced imperial culture is fundamentally evil\".[171][172]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cameron in 2012\n### Method[edit]\n\n\nCameron is regarded as an innovative filmmaker with a classical filmmaking style in the industry, as well as not easy to work for.[173][174][175][176] *Radio Times* critic John Ferguson described Cameron as \"the king of hi-tech thrillers\".[177] Dalin Rowell of */Film* stated: \"Known for his larger-than-life creations and unique filmmaking style, director James Cameron is in a league all of his own. With his genre-spanning work, lofty ambitions, and unrestrained energy, Cameron has carved out a name for himself in Hollywood as an artist willing to do anything to see his vision come true.\"[178] Rebecca Keegan, author of *The Futurist: The Life and Films of James Cameron,* describes Cameron as \"comically hands-on\", and would try to do every job on the set.[174] Andrew Gumbel of *The Independent* says Cameron \"is a nightmare to work with. Studios fear his habit of straying way over schedule and over budget. He is notorious on set for his uncompromising and dictatorial manner, as well as his flaming temper\".[179] Author Alexandra Keller writes that Cameron is an egomaniac, obsessed with vision, but praises his \"technological ingenuity\" at creating a \"visceral viewing experience\".[50]\n\n\nAccording to Ed Harris, who starred in Cameron's film *The Abyss*, Cameron behaved in an autocratic manner.[31] Orson Scott Card, who novelized *The Abyss*, stated that Cameron \"made everyone around him miserable, and his unkindness did nothing to improve the film in any way. Nor did it motivate people to work faster or better\".[180] Harris later said: \"I like Jim. He's an incredibly talented, intelligent guy\", adding that \"it was always good to see him\" in later years.[181] Speaking of her experience on *Titanic*, Kate Winslet said that she admired Cameron, but \"there were times I was genuinely frightened of him\".[182] Describing him as having \"a temper like you wouldn't believe\", she had said she would not work with him again unless it was \"for a lot of money\".[183] Despite this, Winslet and Cameron still looked for future projects, and Winslet was eventually cast in *Avatar 2*.[184] Her co-star Leonardo DiCaprio told *Esquire*: \"When somebody felt a different way on the set, there was a confrontation. He lets you know exactly how he feels\", but complimented Cameron, \"he's of the lineage of John Ford. He knows what he wants his film to be.\"[185] Sam Worthington, who starred in *Avatar*, said that if a mobile phone rang during filming, Cameron would \"nail it to the wall with a nail gun\".[186] Composer James Horner was also not immune to Cameron's demands; he recalls having to write music in a short time frame for *Aliens.*[187] After the experience, Horner did not work with Cameron for a decade.[188] In 1996, they reconciled their friendship and Horner produced the soundtracks for *Titanic* and *Avatar*.[189]\n\n\nDespite this reputation, Sigourney Weaver has praised Cameron's perfectionism and attention to detail, saying: \"He really does want us to risk our lives and limbs for the shot, but he doesn't mind risking his own\".[183] In 2015, Weaver and Jamie Lee Curtis both applauded Cameron in an interview. Curtis remarked: \"He can do every other job [than acting]. I'm talking about every single department, from art direction to props to wardrobe to cameras, he knows more than everyone doing the job\". Curtis also said Cameron \"loves actors\", while Weaver referred to Cameron as \"so generous to actors\" and a \"genius\".[190] Michael Biehn, a frequent collaborator, also praised Cameron, saying he \"is a really passionate person. He cares more about his movies than other directors care about their movies\", adding, \"I've never seen him yell at anybody\". Biehn, however, acknowledged that Cameron is \"not real sensitive when it comes to actors and their trailers, and waiting for actors to come to the set\".[191] Worthington commented: \"He demands excellence. If you don't give it to him, you're going to get chewed out. And that's a good thing\".[183] When asked in 2012 about his reputation, Cameron dryly responded: \"I don't have to shout any more, because the word is out there already\".[192]\n\n\nIn 2021, while giving a MasterClass during a break from his work on the *Avatar* sequels, Cameron acknowledged his past demanding behaviour, opining that if he could go back in time, he would improve the working relationship with his cast and crew members by being less autocratic, thinking of himself as a \"tinpot dictator\"; Cameron stated that when he visited one of Ron Howard's sets, he was \"dumbfounded\" at how much time Howard took to compliment his crew, aspiring to become \"his inner Ron Howard\".[193]\n\n\n\n### Influence[edit]\n\n\nCameron's work has had an impact in the Hollywood film industry. *The Avengers* (2012), directed by Joss Whedon, was inspired by Cameron's approach to action sequences.[194] Whedon also admires Cameron's ability for writing heroic female characters such as Ellen Ripley of *Aliens*,[195] adding that he is \"the leader and the teacher and the Yoda\".[194] Director Michael Bay idolizes Cameron and was convinced by him to use 3D cameras for filming *Transformers: Dark of the Moon* (2011).[196] Cameron's approach to 3D inspired Baz Luhrmann during the production of *The Great Gatsby* (2013).[197] Other directors that have been inspired by Cameron include Peter Jackson, Neill Blomkamp, and Xavier Dolan.[198][199][200]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: James Cameron filmography\n\n\n\nDirected feature films\n| Year\n | Title\n | Distributor\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1982\n | *Piranha II: The Spawning* | Saturn International Pictures / Columbia Pictures |\n| 1984\n | *The Terminator* | Orion Pictures |\n| 1986\n | *Aliens* | 20th Century Fox |\n| 1989\n | *The Abyss* |\n| 1991\n | *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* | TriStar Pictures |\n| 1994\n | *True Lies* | 20th Century Fox / Universal Pictures |\n| 1997\n | *Titanic* | Paramount Pictures / 20th Century Fox\n |\n| 2009\n | *Avatar* | 20th Century Fox\n |\n| 2022\n | *Avatar: The Way of Water* | 20th Century Studios |\n| 2025\n | *Avatar 3* |\n| 2029\n | *Avatar 4* |\n\n\n## Awards and recognition[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of awards and nominations received by James Cameron\n\n![Cameron receiving a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in December 2009](image)Cameron receiving a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, December 2009\nCameron received the inaugural Ray Bradbury Award from the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America in 1992 for *Terminator 2: Judgment Day*.[201] In recognition of \"a distinguished career as a Canadian filmmaker\", Carleton University awarded Cameron the honorary degree of Doctor of Fine Arts on June 13, 1998.[202] Cameron received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1998, presented by Awards Council member George Lucas.[203] He also received an honorary doctorate in 1998 from Brock University in St. Catharines, Ontario, for his accomplishments in the international film industry.[204] In 1998, Cameron attended a convocation to receive an honorary degree from Ryerson University, Toronto.[202] The university awards its highest honor to those who have made extraordinary contributions in Canada or internationally. A year later, Cameron received the honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree from California State University, Fullerton.[205] He accepted the degree at the university's summer annual commencement exercise.[206]\n\n\nCameron's work has been recognized by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences; as one of the few directors to have won three Academy Awards in a single year. For *Titanic*, he won Best Director, Best Picture (shared with Jon Landau) and Best Film Editing (shared with Conrad Buff and Richard A. Harris). In 2009, he was nominated for awards in Best Film Editing (shared with John Refoua and Stephen E.

After the success of The Terminator, Cameron was announced as writer and director of a $60 m big-screen adaptation of the comic book classic. But thanks to a tangled web of litigation, studio bankruptcies, and wrangling over screenplay credits, that movie never saw light ... What remains, however, is Cameron's tantalising 47-page Spidey 'scriptment', a compacted screenplay-cum-narrative that mapped out his entire film in brief ... Koepp's first draft is taken often word-for-word from Cameron's story, though later versions were heavily rewritten by numerous screenwriters. Despite this\u2014and much to Cameron's chagrin\u2014 Koepp's name is the only one on the screenplay.\n60. **^** \"Who Is Spider-Man?\". *Hollywood.com*. March 19, 2001.

They won a Primetime Emmy Award for *Arrested Development*.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nAnthony Russo (born February 3, 1970)[1][2] and Joseph Russo (born July 18, 1971)[2][3] were born and raised in Cleveland, Ohio, the sons of Patricia Gallupoli and attorney and judge Basil Russo.[4] Their parents were both of Italian descent.[5] Their paternal and maternal families emigrated from Sicily and Abruzzo, respectively, and settling in Ohio.[4] They attended Benedictine High School.[6] Joe graduated from the University of Iowa and majored in English and writing, while Anthony graduated from the University of Pennsylvania and majored in business before switching to English.[7][8][9]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nThe Russo brothers were graduate students at Case Western Reserve University (where Anthony studied law and Joe studied acting at UEA) when they began directing, writing, and producing their first feature, *Pieces.* They financed the film with student loans and credit cards.[10] After viewing *Pieces* at the Slamdance Film Festival, Steven Soderbergh approached the duo and offered to produce their next film, along with his producing partner George Clooney.[10] This project was the crime comedy *Welcome to Collinwood*, starring William H. Macy, Sam Rockwell, and Clooney.[11]\n\n\nFX network executive Kevin Reilly hired the Russos to direct the pilot for the series *Lucky*, having liked the pair's work on *Collinwood*. Ron Howard was a fan of the pilot, and he had a hand in hiring the brothers to direct the pilot for Fox's *Arrested Development*.[10]\n\n\nThe Russo brothers directed *Avengers: Infinity War* (2018), which became the first superhero movie to gross over $2 billion at the box office. They are the third directors to make a $2 billion movie after James Cameron's films *Avatar* and *Titanic* and J. J. Abrams's film *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*. Its sequel, *Avengers: Endgame*, was released on April 26, 2019, broke numerous box office records, and became the second superhero movie to gross over $2 billion.[12] They join James Cameron as the only directors to make two $2 billion films.[13]\n\n\nThe brothers are financing the Los Angeles and Beijing joint-production company Anthem & Song, which is producing the Chinese superhero film *The Hero's Awakening*.[14][15]\n\n\nThe Russos also served as producers of the film *Everything Everywhere All At Once*, written and directed by Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert.[16] The film, released in theatres in March 2022, is A24's highest-grossing film worldwide at the box office.[17]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Directors | Writer(s) | Producers
