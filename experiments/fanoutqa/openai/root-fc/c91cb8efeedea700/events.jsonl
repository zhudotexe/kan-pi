For countries in which the head of state and head of government are separate, both offices are listed. For leaders who held the same office prior to their state's independence, the start of their tenure is used, not independence. For a list of heads of state taking dates of independence into account, see List of heads of state by diplomatic precedence.\n\n\nActing presidents are included in this list, but if a leader has non-consecutive terms, only the current period of service is listed.\n\n\nStates where head of state differs from head of government are mainly parliamentary systems. Often a leader holds both positions in presidential systems or dictatorships. Some states have semi-presidential systems where the head of government role is fulfilled by both the listed head of government and the head of state.\n\n\n\n\n## List of state leaders by date of

Such fluctuations change a country's ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference to the standard of living of its population.\n\n\nGDP per capita is often considered an indicator of a country's standard of living;[1][2] however, this is inaccurate because GDP per capita is not a measure of personal income.\n\n\nComparisons of national income are also frequently made on the basis of purchasing power parity (PPP), to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries. (*see* List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita). PPP largely removes the exchange rate problem but not others; it does not reflect the value of economic output in international trade, and it also requires more estimation than GDP per capita. On the whole, PPP per capita figures are more narrowly spread than nominal GDP per capita figures.\n\n\nNon-sovereign entities (the world, continents, and some dependent territories) and states with limited international recognition (such as Kosovo, Palestine, and Taiwan) are included in the list in cases in which they appear in the sources. These economies are not ranked in the charts here, but are listed in sequence by GDP for comparison. In addition, non-sovereign entities are marked in *italics*.\n\n\nNote that several leading GDP-per-capita (nominal) jurisdictions may be considered tax havens, and their GDP data subject to material distortion by tax planning activities. Examples include Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Ireland, and Luxembourg.[3]\n\n\n*All data are in current United States dollars. Historical data can be found here.*\n\n\n\n\n## Table[edit]\n\n\n*The table initially ranks each country or territory with their latest available estimates, and can be reranked by either of the sources.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGDP (in USD) per capita by country (including  territories, and countries not included in the IMF report )\n| Country/Territory\n | UN Region | IMF[4][5] | World Bank[6] |

and Corporate haven § Distorted GDP/GNP\n\nMany of the leading GDP-per-capita (nominal) jurisdictions are tax havens whose economic data is artificially inflated by tax-driven corporate accounting entries.\n\n\nFor instance, the Irish GDP data above is subject to material distortion by the tax planning activities of foreign multinationals in Ireland. To address this, in 2017 the Central Bank of Ireland created \"modified GNI\" (or GNI\\*) as a more appropriate statistic, and the OECD and IMF have adopted it for Ireland. 2015 Irish GDP is 143% of 2015 Irish GNI\\*.\n\n\n\n\n> A stunning $12 trillion—almost 40 percent of all foreign direct investment positions globally—is completely artificial: it consists of financial investment passing through empty corporate shells with no real activity. These investments in empty corporate shells almost always pass through well-known tax havens. The eight major pass-through economies—the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Hong Kong SAR, the British Virgin Islands, Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Ireland, and Singapore—host more than 85 percent of the world’s investment in special purpose entities, which are often set up for tax reasons. \n> \n> — \"Piercing the Veil\", International Monetary Fund, June 2018[9]\n> \n\n\nFurther discussion on this topic can be found in the List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita article.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita\n* List of countries by GDP (nominal)\n* List of IMF ranked countries by GDP, IMF ranked GDP (nominal), GDP (nominal) per capita, GDP (PPP), GDP (PPP) per capita, Population, and PPP\n* List of countries by average wage\n* List of countries by external debt\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The European Union is included because it is far more than a free trade association such as ASEAN, NAFTA, or Mercosur.

This is similar to nominal GDP per capita, but adjusted for the cost of living in each country.\n\n\nIn 2019, the estimated average GDP per capita (PPP) of all of the countries of the world was Int$ 18,381.[a] For rankings regarding wealth, see list of countries by wealth per adult.\n\n\n\n\n## Method[edit]\n\n\nThe gross domestic product (GDP) per capita figures on this page are derived from PPP calculations. Such calculations are prepared by various organizations, including the IMF and the World Bank. As estimates and assumptions have to be made, the results produced by different organizations for the same country are not hard facts and tend to differ, sometimes substantially, so they should be used with caution.\n\n\nComparisons of national wealth are frequently made on the basis of *nominal* GDP and savings (not just income), which do not reflect differences in the cost of living in different countries (*see List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita*); hence, using a PPP basis is arguably more useful when comparing generalized differences in living standards between economies because PPP takes into account the relative cost of living and the inflation rates of the countries, rather than using only exchange rates, which may distort the real differences in income.\n\n\nThis is why GDP (PPP) per capita is often considered one of the indicators of a country's standard of living,[3][4] although this can be problematic because GDP per capita is not a measure of personal income. (*See Standard of living and GDP*.)\n\n\nGDP (PPP) and GDP (PPP) per capita are usually measured by international dollar, which is a hypothetical currency that has the same purchasing power in every economy as the U.S. dollar in the United States.\n\n\n\n## Table[edit]\n\n\nAll figures are in current international dollars, and rounded to the nearest whole number.\n\n\n*The table initially ranks each country or territory with their latest available year's estimates, and can be reranked by either of the sources.*\n\n\n\\* *Nearly all country links in the table connect to articles titled \"Income in (*country *or* territory*)\" or to \"Economy of (*country *or* territory*)\".*\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGDP per capita (current international dollar) by country or  territory or non IMF members \n|

However, it is increasingly being recognized that tax havens, or corporate tax havens, have distorted economic data which produces artificially high, or inflated, GDP-per-capita figures.[17] It is estimated that over 15% of global jurisdictions are tax havens (see tax haven lists).[18] An IMF investigation estimates that circa 40% of global foreign direct investment flows, which heavily influence the GDP of various jurisdictions, are described as \"phantom\" transactions.[19]\n\n\n\n\n> A stunning $12 trillion—almost 40 percent of all foreign direct investment positions globally—is completely artificial: it consists of financial investment passing through empty corporate shells with no real activity. These investments in empty corporate shells almost always pass through well-known tax havens. The eight major pass-through economies—the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Hong Kong SAR, the British Virgin Islands, Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Ireland, and Singapore—host more than 85 percent of the world's investment in special purpose entities, which are often set up for tax reasons. \n> \n> — \"Piercing the Veil\", International Monetary Fund, June 2018[19]\n> \n\n\nIn 2017, Ireland's economic data became so distorted by U.S. multinational tax avoidance strategies (see leprechaun economics), also known as BEPS actions, that Ireland effectively abandoned GDP (and GNP) statistics as credible measures of its economy, and created a replacement statistic called modified gross national income (or GNI\\*). Ireland is one of the world's largest corporate tax havens.\n\n\n\n\n> Ireland has, more or less, stopped using GDP to measure its own economy. And on current trends [because Irish GDP is distorting EU-28 aggregate data], the eurozone taken as a whole may need to consider something similar.\n> \n> — Brad Setser, Council on Foreign Relations, \"Ireland exports its Leprechaun\", 25 April 2018[20]\n> \n\n\n\n> The statistical distortions created by the impact on the Irish National Accounts of the global assets and activities of a handful of large multinational corporations have now become so large as to make a mockery of conventional uses of Irish GDP.\n> \n> — Patrick Honohan, ex-Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, 13 July 2016[21]\n> \n\n\nA list of the top 15 GDP-per-capita countries from 2016 to 2017, contains most of the major global tax havens (see GDP-per-capita tax haven proxy for more detail):\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **International Monetary Fund (2017)** | **World Bank (2016)**[22][23] |\n| \n\n| Rank\n | Country/Territory\n | Type\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | ![](image) Qatar | Oil & Gas\n |\n| — | *![](image) Macau* | Tax haven (Sink OFC)\n |\n| 2 | ![](image) Luxembourg | Top 10 Tax haven (Sink OFC)\n |\n| 3 | ![](image) Singapore | Top 10 Tax haven (Conduit OFC)\n |\n| 4 | ![](image) Brunei | Oil & Gas\n |\n| 5 | ![](image) Ireland | Top 10 Tax haven (Conduit OFC)\n |\n| 6 | ![](image) Norway | Oil & Gas\n |\n| 7 | ![](image) Kuwait | Oil & Gas\n |\n| 8 | ![](image) United Arab Emirates | Oil & Gas\n |\n| 9 | ![](image)  Switzerland | Top 10 Tax Haven (Conduit OFC)\n |\n| — | *![](image) Hong Kong* | Top 10 Tax Haven (Sink OFC)\n |\n| 10 | ![](image) San Marino | Tax haven (Sink OFC)\n |\n| 11 | ![](image) United States | 59,495\n |\n| 12 | ![](image) Saudi Arabia | Oil & Gas\n |\n| 13 | ![](image) Netherlands | Top 10 Tax Haven (Conduit OFC)\n |\n| 14 | ![](image) Iceland | 52,150\n |\n| 15 | ![](image) Bahrain | Oil & Gas\n |\n\n | \n\n| Rank\n | Country/Territory\n | Type\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | ![](image) Qatar | Oil & Gas\n |\n| 2 | ![](image) Luxembourg | Top 10 Tax haven (Sink OFC)\n |\n| — | *![](image) Macau* | Tax haven (Sink OFC)\n |\n| 3 | ![](image) Singapore | Top 10 Tax haven (Conduit OFC)\n |\n| 4 | ![](image) Brunei | Oil & Gas\n |\n| 5 | ![](image) United Arab Emirates | Oil & Gas\n |\n| 6 | ![](image) Ireland | Top 10 Tax haven (Conduit OFC)\n |\n| 7 | ![](image)  Switzerland | Top 10 Tax haven (Conduit OFC)\n |\n| 8 | ![](image) Norway | Oil & Gas\n |\n| — | *![](image) Hong Kong* | Top 10 Tax haven (Sink OFC)\n |\n| 9 | ![](image) United States | 57,467\n |\n| 10 | ![](image) Saudi Arabia | Oil & Gas\n |\n| 11 | ![](image) Iceland | 51,399\n |\n| 12 | ![](image) Netherlands | Top 10 Tax haven (Conduit OFC)\n |\n| 13 | ![](image) Austria | 50,078\n |\n| 14 | ![](image) Denmark | 49,496\n |\n| 15 | ![](image) Sweden | 49,175\n |\n\n |  |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of countries by GDP (PPP)\n* List of countries by GDP (nominal)\n* List of countries by past and projected GDP (PPP) per capita\n* List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita\n* List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita growth rate\n* List of IMF ranked countries by GDP\n* Quality of life\n* Big Mac Index\n* Government spending\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** There have been no exclusive estimates for world average by the IMF.
