He began his career as a screenwriter in the mid-1990s, starting at Troma Entertainment with *Tromeo and Juliet* (1997). He then began working as a director, starting with the horror-comedy film *Slither* (2006), and moving to the superhero genre with *Super* (2010), *Guardians of the Galaxy* (2014), *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2* (2017), *The Suicide Squad* (2021), and *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3* (2023). In 2022, Warner Bros.

He will also continue to write and direct various projects set in the DCU, including the upcoming film *Superman: Legacy* (2025).\n\n\nHe also wrote and directed the web series *James Gunn's PG Porn* (2008\u20132009), the HBO Max original series *Peacemaker* (2022\u2013present) and *Creature Commandos* (2024), and the Disney+ original special *The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special* (2022).

Gunn, an attorney, and Leota \"Lee\" (Hynek).[6][7][8] He was raised Catholic[9] in the St Louis suburb municipality of Manchester, Missouri.[10][11] He has five siblings \u2014 actor Sean, actor and political writer Matt, screenwriter Brian, Patrick, and Beth.[12][13][14] Gunn is of Irish and Jewish descent[15] his father coming from an Irish immigrant family.[16] Gunn has stated that his family's surname was originally the Irish name MacGilgunn and that it means \"sons to the servants of the god of the dead\"; it actually means \"son of the brown youth.\"[17][18][19][20]\n\n\nGrowing up, Gunn was influenced by low-budget films such as *Night of the Living Dead* and *Friday the 13th*. He read magazines like *Fangoria* and attended genre movie screenings, including the original *Dawn of the Dead* at the Tivoli Theatre in St. Louis. At the age of 12, he began making 8 mm zombie films with his brothers in the woods near their home.[21]\n\n\nGunn and his brothers all attended the Jesuit St. Louis University High School, where he graduated in 1984.[5][6] He went on to earn a Bachelor of Arts from Saint Louis University.[22] While at Saint Louis University, Gunn created political cartoons for the school's student weekly, *The University News*.[23] Gunn said that, at an unspecified time in his college education, \"I went to two years undergraduate film school at Loyola Marymount in Los Angeles. But I was pretty screwed up at the time, and had to leave. Years later I went to graduate school at the Columbia University School of Fine Arts but I studied prose writing, not film writing.\"[24] He earned a Master of Fine Arts from Columbia University in 1995.[25]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nWhile living in St. Louis, Gunn founded a band, The Icons, in 1989, serving as lead vocalist. The group released the album *Mom, We Like It Here on Earth* in 1994, and its songs \"Sunday\" and \"Walking Naked\" were featured in the film *Tromeo and Juliet*. The Icons disbanded in the mid-1990s.[26] Gunn has continued to work in music, composing songs for *Scooby-Doo*, *Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed*, and *Movie 43*.\n\n\n\n### Film and television[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gunn in 2013\nGunn began his career in filmmaking with Troma Entertainment in 1995, for which he co-wrote the independent film *Tromeo and Juliet*. Working alongside his mentor Lloyd Kaufman, the co-founder of Troma, Gunn learned how to write screenplays, produce films, scout locations, direct actors, distribute films, and create his own poster art.[21] After contributing to several other Troma films, Gunn in 2000 wrote, produced and performed in the superhero comedy *The Specials*, directed by Craig Mazin and featuring Rob Lowe, Thomas Haden Church, Paget Brewster, Judy Greer and Jamie Kennedy.\n\n\nGunn's first major Hollywood screenplay was *Scooby-Doo* in 2002. In 2004, he wrote the screenplays for the remake of *Dawn of the Dead* and the sequel *Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed*. With these films, Gunn became the first screenwriter to have two films top the box office in consecutive weeks.[27] That same year, he executive produced and starred in the mockumentary *LolliLove*, directed by and starring his then-wife Jenna Fischer. His film directorial debut was the 2006 horror-comedy *Slither*, which was included on Rotten Tomatoes' list of the 50 Best Ever Reviewed Horror Movies.[28]\n\n\nGunn's next projects included the comedy short film \"Humanzee!\" which was originally intended exclusively for the Xbox Live's *Horror Meets Comedy* series of short comedy films by horror directors, it was replaced with \"Sparky and Mikaela\" which debuted on Xbox Live on December 31, 2008. In an April 2009 interview on *The Jace Hall Show*, Gunn described \"Sparky and Mikaela\" as being \"about a human [and] racoon crime fighting team and they fight crime in both the forest world, among the furry animals, and in the human world\".[29] Gunn also has a short-form web series for Spike.com titled *James Gunn's PG Porn*.\n\n\nIn 2008, Gunn was a judge on the VH1 reality television show *Scream Queens*, where 10 unknown actresses compete for a role in the film *Saw VI*.[30]\n\n\nIn 2009, Gunn announced he was going to write and direct *Pets*, a comedy about a man who is abducted by aliens who want to turn him into a household pet, with Ben Stiller, Stuart Cornfeld and Jeremy Kramer producing.[31] However, by March 2009, Gunn announced, \"*Pets* unfortunately, is done. I'm gone. I left the project for various reasons. I hope it sees the light of day somehow, but it won't be with me attached as director.\"[32]\n\n\nIn 2010, Gunn released *Super*, a dark comedy and superhero satire starring Rainn Wilson and Elliot Page. He also directed a segment of the 2013 comedy anthology film *Movie 43* (2013); the segment starred Elizabeth Banks and Josh Duhamel. The film was critically panned.\n\n\n\n![](image)Gunn in 2014\nGunn co-wrote and directed the Marvel Studios adaptation of *Guardians of the Galaxy*, which was released on August 1, 2014.[33] His brother, Sean, has a role in the film. Gunn has appeared as an actor, mostly in smaller roles or uncredited appearances in his own projects. After Dan Gilroy and Jack Black separately lamented the proliferation of superhero films,[34] Gunn responded in a Facebook post, saying in part:\n\n\n> Popular fare in any medium has always been snubbed by the self-appointed elite. ... What bothers me slightly is that many people assume because you make big films that you put less love, care, and thought into them than people do who make independent films or who make what are considered more serious Hollywood films. ... If you think people who make superhero movies are dumb, come out and say we're dumb. But if you, as an independent filmmaker or a 'serious' filmmaker, think you put more love into your characters than the Russo Brothers do Captain America, or Joss Whedon does the Hulk, or I do a talking raccoon, you are simply mistaken.[35]\n> \n> \n\n\nGunn wrote and produced the horror film *The Belko Experiment*, which was released in 2017.[36] In 2016, he directed three Stan Lee cameo scenes in one day, for the film *Doctor Strange* and two unrevealed projects.[37][38][39]\n\n\nGunn wrote and directed *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2* (2017).[40][41][42] Gunn was slated to direct *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3* in July 2018, but before the project started, Disney severed ties with Gunn as the director amid controversy over off-color jokes he had tweeted.[43] Gunn was rehired in March 2019 after a mass public appeal, many saying he was the reason of the previous movies' successes.[44]\n\n\nIn October 2018, Gunn was hired to write a completely new script for the DC Extended Universe film *The Suicide Squad*, with the intention of also serving as director, after its original director Gavin O'Connor left due to scheduling issues.[45][46] In January 2019, he was officially confirmed to direct *The Suicide Squad*.[47] He also wrote, directed, and produced the spin-off television series for the film centered on the character Peacemaker played by John Cena for Max.[48] Gunn will also co-write and co-produce a live-action/animated film titled *Coyote vs. Acme*, based on the Looney Tunes character Wile E. Coyote, for Warner Bros. Pictures Animation.[49] He is also executive-producing a *Peacemaker* spin-off centered on Amanda Waller, with Christal Henry writing and Viola Davis reprising her role from previous DCEU projects.[50] In addition, Gunn is writing and directing another project for DC.[51] Gunn is also involved in multiple other DC projects, including television series.[51]\n\n\n\n### Other media[edit]\n\n\nGunn wrote a novel in 2000, *The Toy Collector*, a story of a hospital orderly who steals drugs from the hospital which he sells to help keep his toy collection habit alive. In 1998, he and Troma's President Lloyd Kaufman co-wrote *All I Need to Know about Filmmaking I Learned from The Toxic Avenger*, about his experiences with Kaufman while working at Troma.\n\n\nHe wrote the story for Grasshopper Manufacture's video game *Lollipop Chainsaw*, working with game designer Suda 51.[52]\n\n\n\n### Firing from Disney and reinstatement[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2018, in reaction to Gunn's public criticisms of Donald Trump, commentator Mike Cernovich drew attention to controversial jokes that Gunn posted on social media between 2008 and 2012 involving pedophilia and the Holocaust.[53][54] Amid criticism of the tweets, Disney severed ties with Gunn as the director of the upcoming *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3* film at the time;[55] Gunn responded: \"I have regretted [those jokes] for many years since. [...] Regardless of how much time has passed, I understand and accept the business decisions taken today. Even these many years later, I take full responsibility for the way I conducted myself then. All I can do now [is offer] my sincere and heartfelt regret [...] To everyone inside my industry and beyond, I again offer my deepest apologies.\"[55][56]\n\n\nWalt Disney Studios's decision received criticism from many entertainers and journalists, including actors Dave Bautista, Selma Blair, Patton Oswalt, David Dastmalchian, Michael Ian Black, Mikaela Hoover, Mike Colter, Alex Winter, David Hasselhoff, directors Joe Carnahan and Fede \u00c1lvarez, comics artist Jim Starlin, musician Rhett Miller, comedian Jim Jefferies, *Rick and Morty* creators Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon, journalist David A. French and Troma Entertainment founder and president Lloyd Kaufman.[57][58][59] Bobcat Goldthwait, who worked as a voice actor on the 1997 Disney film *Hercules*, responded to the incident by asking Disney to remove his voice from an upcoming park attraction based on the film.[60]\n\n\nA number of media outlets criticized Disney's decision, including *Collider*, *Cartoon Brew*, *The Daily Dot*, *The Independent*, *National Review*, *MovieWeb*, and *Vulture*.[61][58][62] An online petition urging Disney to re-hire Gunn received over 400,000 signatures.[57][63] On July 30, 2018, *Guardians of the Galaxy* cast members Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel, Sean Gunn, Karen Gillan, Pom Klementieff and Michael Rooker released a joint statement through social media expressing their support for Gunn.[64]\n\n\nBecause of the situation, Sony Pictures decided to not promote the horror film *Brightburn*, which Gunn produced, at the 2018 San Diego Comic-Con.[65] However, when the first trailer for the film was released on December 8, 2018, Gunn's name was prominently featured. The film opened in May 2019.[66]\n\n\nIn March 2019, Gunn was reinstated by Disney as director of the film after meeting with Alan Horn, chairman of Walt Disney Studios. Gunn started production on *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3* in October 2021, after *The Suicide Squad* had been completed.[44]\n\n\n\n### DC Studios[edit]\n\n\nGunn and Peter Safran had advised David Zaslav, the CEO of the newly-created Warner Bros. Discovery, during his search for a new head of DC Films. The duo impressed Zaslav who decided to appoint them as the co-chairpersons and CEOs of DC Films, rebranded as \"DC Studios\", with control over films, animation and television projects based on characters from DC Comics. Gunn oversees the creative aspects and will be exclusive to Warner Bros. Discovery during his tenure, except for his prior commitments to Disney. The two assumed their positions on November 1, 2022.[67][68][69][70]\n\n\nIn December 2022, Gunn announced that he was writing a film about a young Superman during his early years in Metropolis,[71] later revealed to be titled *Superman: Legacy* and scheduled for release in July 2025; in March 2023 it was confirmed Gunn would also direct the project.[72] In January 2023, Gunn and Safran revealed their plans for future DCU films, with the first chapter being titled \"Gods and Monsters\".

Known for his Hollywood blockbusters with complex storytelling, Nolan is considered a leading filmmaker of the 21st century. His films have grossed more than $6\u00a0billion worldwide. The recipient of many accolades, he has been nominated for five Academy Awards, five BAFTA Awards and six Golden Globe Awards. In 2015, he was listed as one of the 100 most influential people in the world by *Time*, and in 2019, he was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire for his contributions to film.\n\n\nNolan developed an interest in filmmaking from a young age. After studying English literature at University College London, he made several short films before his feature film debut with *Following* (1998). Nolan gained international recognition with his second film, *Memento* (2000), for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. He transitioned from independent to studio filmmaking with *Insomnia* (2002), and found further critical and commercial success with *The Dark Knight* trilogy (2005\u20132012), *The Prestige* (2006) and *Inception* (2010); the last of these earned Nolan two Oscar nominations\u2014Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay. This was followed by *Interstellar* (2014), *Dunkirk* (2017), *Tenet* (2020) and *Oppenheimer* (2023). For *Dunkirk,* he earned two Academy Award nominations, including his first for Best Director.\n\n\nNolan's work regularly features in the listings of best films of their respective decades. Infused with a metaphysical outlook, his films thematise epistemology, existentialism, ethics, the construction of time, and the malleable nature of memory and personal identity. They feature mathematically-inspired images and concepts, unconventional narrative structures, practical special effects, experimental soundscapes, large-format film photography, and materialistic perspectives. He has co-written several of his films with his brother, Jonathan, and runs the production company Syncopy Inc. with his wife, Emma Thomas.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nChristopher Edward Nolan was born on 30 July 1970, in Westminster, London. His father, Brendan James Nolan, was a British advertising executive who worked as a creative director. His mother, Christina Jensen, was an American flight attendant from Evanston, Illinois; she would later work as a teacher of English. He has an elder brother, Matthew, and a younger brother, Jonathan, also a filmmaker. The three were raised in London and would spend their summers in Evanston. The three brothers were raised Catholic.[1] Nolan holds both UK and US citizenship.[2]\n\n\n\n![An image showing the top of the oculus in the Flaxman Gallery, University College London](image)Nolan attended University College London and used its Flaxman Gallery for a scene in *Inception* (2010).[3]\nGrowing up, Nolan was particularly influenced by the work of Ridley Scott and the science fiction films *2001: A Space Odyssey* (1968) and *Star Wars* (1977).[4][5] He would repeatedly watch the latter film and extensively research its making.[6] Nolan began making films at the age of seven, borrowing his father's Super\u00a08 camera and shooting short films with his action figures.[7] These films included a stop motion animation homage to *Star Wars* called *Space Wars*. He cast his brother Jonathan and built sets from \"clay, flour, egg boxes and toilet rolls\".[4] His uncle, who had worked at NASA building guidance systems for the Apollo rockets, sent him some launch footage: \"I re-filmed them off the screen and cut them in, thinking no-one would notice\", Nolan later remarked.[8] From the age of 11, he aspired to be a professional filmmaker.[9] Between 1981 and 1983, Nolan enrolled at Barrow Hills, a Catholic prep school in Weybridge, Surrey.[10] In his teenage years, Nolan started making films with Adrien and Roko Belic. Nolan and Roko co-directed the surreal 8\u00a0mm *Tarantella* (1989), which was shown on *Image Union*, an independent film and video showcase on the Public Broadcasting Service.[a][12][13]\n\n\nNolan was educated at Haileybury and Imperial Service College, an independent school in Hertford Heath, Hertfordshire, and later studied English literature at University College London (UCL). Opting out of a traditional film education, he pursued \"a degree in something unrelated\", which his father suggested \"gives a different take on things\".[14] He chose UCL specifically for its filmmaking facilities, which comprised a Steenbeck editing suite and 16\u00a0mm film cameras.[15] Nolan was president of the Union's Film Society,[15] and with Emma Thomas (his girlfriend and future wife) he screened feature films in 35mm during the school year and used the money earned to produce 16\u00a0mm films over the summers.[16]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 1993\u20132003: Early career and breakthrough[edit]\n\n\nAfter earning his bachelor's degree in English literature in 1993, Nolan worked as a script reader, camera operator and director of corporate films and industrial films.[15][17][18] He directed, wrote and edited the short film *Larceny* (1996),[19] which was filmed over a weekend in black and white with limited equipment and a small cast and crew.[12][20] Funded by Nolan and shot with the UCL Union Film society's equipment, it appeared at the Cambridge Film Festival in 1996 and is considered one of UCL's best shorts.[21] For unknown reasons, the film has since been removed from public view.[19] Nolan filmed a third short, *Doodlebug* (1997), about a man seemingly chasing an insect with his shoe, only to discover that it is a miniature of himself.[14][22] Nolan and Thomas first attempted to make a feature in the mid-1990s with *Larry Mahoney*, which they scrapped.[23] During this period in his career, Nolan had little to no success getting his projects off the ground, facing several rejections; he added, \"[T]here's a very limited pool of finance in the UK. To be honest, it's a very clubby kind of place\u00a0... Never had any support whatsoever from the British film industry.\"[24]\n\n\nShortly after abandoning *Larry Mahoney*, Nolan conceived the idea for his first feature, *Following* (1998), which he wrote, directed, photographed and edited. The film depicts an unemployed young writer (Jeremy Theobald) who trails strangers through London, hoping they will provide material for his first novel, but is drawn into a criminal underworld when he fails to keep his distance. It was inspired by Nolan's experience of living in London and having his apartment burgled; he observed that the common attribute between larceny and pursuing someone through a crowd was that they both cross social boundaries.[25] Co-produced by Nolan with Thomas and Theobald,[26] it was made on a budget of around \u00a33,000. Most of the cast and crew were friends of Nolan, and shooting took place on weekends over the course of a year.[27] To conserve film stock, each scene was rehearsed extensively to ensure that the first or second take could be used in the final edit.[14][28] *Following* won several awards during its festival run and was well received by critics who labelled Nolan a majorly talented debutant.[29][30] Scott Timberg of *New Times LA* wrote that it \"echoed Hitchcock classics\", but was \"leaner and meaner\".[31] Janet Maslin of *The New York Times* was impressed with its \"spare look\" and \"agile hand-held camerawork\", saying, \"As a result, the actors convincingly carry off the before, during and after modes that the film eventually, and artfully, weaves together.\"[32]\n\n\n\n> \n> \"The difference between shooting *Following* with a group of friends wearing our own clothes and my mum making sandwiches to spending $4\u00a0million of somebody else's money on *Memento* and having a crew of a hundred people is, to this day, by far the biggest leap I've ever made.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014Nolan on the jump from his first film to his second (2012)[33]\n\n*Following*'s success afforded Nolan the opportunity to make *Memento* (2000), which became his breakthrough film. His brother Jonathan pitched the idea to him, about a man with anterograde amnesia who uses notes and tattoos to hunt for his wife's murderer. Jonathan worked the idea into a short story, \"Memento Mori\" (2001), and Nolan developed it into a screenplay that told the story in reverse. Aaron Ryder, an executive for Newmarket Films, said it was \"perhaps the most innovative script I had ever seen\".[34] The film was optioned and given a budget of $4.5\u00a0million, with Guy Pearce and Carrie-Anne Moss in the starring roles.[35] Newmarket also distributed the film after it was rejected by studios who feared that it would not attract a wide audience. Following a positive word of mouth and screenings in 500 theatres, it earned $40\u00a0million.[36] *Memento* premiered at the Venice Film Festival in September 2000 to critical acclaim.[37] Joe Morgenstern of *The Wall Street Journal* wrote in his review, \"I can't remember when a movie has seemed so clever, strangely affecting and slyly funny at the very same time.\"[38] In the book *The Philosophy of Neo-Noir*, Basil Smith drew a comparison with John Locke's *An Essay Concerning Human Understanding*, which argues that conscious memories constitute our identities \u2013 a theme Nolan explores in the film.[39] *Memento* earned Nolan many accolades, including nominations for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay, as well as two Independent Spirit Awards: Best Director and Best Screenplay.[40][41] Six critics listed it as one of the best films of the 2000s.[42] In 2001, Nolan and Emma Thomas founded the production company Syncopy Inc.[43][b]\n\n\nImpressed by his work on *Memento*, filmmaker Steven Soderbergh recommended Nolan to Warner Bros. to direct the psychological thriller *Insomnia* (2002), although the studio initially wanted a more seasoned director.[45] A remake of the 1997 Norwegian thriller of the same name, the film is viewed as \"the outlier of Nolan's filmography\" due to its perceived lack of unconventionality he is known for.[46] Starring Al Pacino, Robin Williams and Hilary Swank,[47] *Insomnia* follows two Los Angeles detectives sent to a northern Alaskan town to investigate the murder of a local teenager. It received positive reviews from critics and earned $113\u00a0million against a budget of $46\u00a0million.[48][49] Film critic Roger Ebert praised the film for introducing new perspectives and ideas on the issues of morality and guilt, adding, \"Unlike most remakes, the Nolan *Insomnia* is not a pale retread, but a re-examination of the material, like a new production of a good play.\"[50] Richard Schickel of *Time* deemed *Insomnia* a \"worthy successor\" to *Memento* and \"a triumph of atmosphere over a none-too-mysterious mystery\".[51]\n\n\n*Following*, *Memento* and *Insomnia* established Nolan's image as an \"auteur\".[52] After the lattermost, he wrote a screenplay for a Howard Hughes biopic. Nolan reluctantly tabled his script after learning that Martin Scorsese was already making one such film: *The Aviator* (2004).[53] He was then briefly attached to direct a film adaptation of Ruth Rendell's novel *The Keys to the Street* for Fox Searchlight Pictures but chose to direct *Batman Begins* instead.[54] Nolan turned down an offer to direct the historical epic *Troy* (2004).[55] In April 2003, filmmaker David O. Russell put Nolan in a headlock at a Hollywood party after learning that Jude Law, whom Russell wanted to cast, had decided to work with Nolan instead. Russell pressured Nolan to display \"artistic solidarity\" by relinquishing Law from his cast.[56][57]\n\n\n\n### 2003\u20132013: Widespread recognition[edit]\n\n\nIn early 2003, Nolan approached Warner Bros. with the idea of making a new Batman film, based on the character's origin story.[58] Nolan was fascinated by the notion of grounding it in a more realistic world than a comic-book fantasy.[59] He relied heavily on traditional stunts and miniature effects during filming, with minimal use of computer-generated imagery (CGI).[60] *Batman Begins* (2005), the biggest project Nolan had undertaken to that point,[61] was released to critical acclaim and commercial success.[62][63] Starring Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne / Batman\u2014along with Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Liam Neeson\u2014*Batman Begins* revived the franchise.[64][65] *Batman Begins* was 2005's ninth-highest-grossing film and was praised for its psychological depth and contemporary relevance;[63][66] it is cited as one of the most influential films of the 2000s.[67] Film author Ian Nathan wrote that within five years of his career, Nolan \"[went] from unknown to indie darling to gaining creative control over one of the biggest properties in Hollywood, and (perhaps unwittingly) fomenting the genre that would redefine the entire industry\".[68]\n\n\nNolan directed, co-wrote and produced *The Prestige* (2006), an adaptation of the Christopher Priest novel about two rival 19th-century magicians.[69] The screenplay was the result of an intermittent, five-year collaboration between him and his brother Jonathan, who had begun writing it already in 2001. Nolan initially intended to make the film as early as 2003, but had postponed the project after agreeing to make *Batman Begins*.[70][71] Starring Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale in the lead roles of rival magicians, *The Prestige* received critical acclaim and received two Academy Award nominations.[72][73] Roger Ebert described it as \"quite a movie\u00a0\u2013 atmospheric, obsessive, almost satanic\",[74] and Kenneth Turan of the *Los Angeles Times* called it an \"ambitious, unnerving melodrama\".[75] *The Guardian*'s Philip French wrote: \"In addition to the intellectual or philosophical excitement it engenders, *The Prestige* is gripping, suspenseful, mysterious, moving and often darkly funny.\"[76] Despite a negative box-office prognosis, the film earned over $109\u00a0million against a budget of $40\u00a0million.[77]\n\n\n\n![Christopher Nolan speaking to the mic while four people are standing behind him](image)Nolan (left) with the cast and crew of *The Dark Knight* at the 2008 European premiere in London\n*The Dark Knight* (2008), the follow-up to *Batman Begins*, was Nolan's next venture. Initially reluctant to make a sequel, he agreed after Warner Bros. repeatedly insisted.[78] Nolan wanted to expand on the noir quality of the first film by broadening the canvas and taking on \"the dynamic of a story of the city, a large crime story\u00a0... where you're looking at the police, the justice system, the vigilante, the poor people, the rich people, the criminals\".[79] Continuing to minimalise the use of CGI, Nolan employed high-resolution IMAX cameras, making it the first major motion picture to use this technology.[80][81] *The Dark Knight* has been ranked as one of the best films of the 2000s and one of the best superhero films ever made.[c] Many critics declare *The Dark Knight* to be \"the most successful comic book film ever made\".[86] Manohla Dargis of *The New York Times* found the film to be of higher artistic merit than many Hollywood blockbusters: \"Pitched at the divide between art and industry, poetry and entertainment, it goes darker and deeper than any Hollywood movie of its comic-book kind.\"[87] Ebert expressed a similar point of view, describing it as a \"haunted film that leaps beyond its origins and becomes an engrossing tragedy\".[88] *The Dark Knight* set many box-office records during its theatrical run,[89] earning over $1\u00a0billion worldwide.[90] At the 81st Academy Awards, the film was nominated in eight categories, winning two: Best Sound Editing for Richard King and a posthumous Best Supporting Actor award for Heath Ledger.[91] The film's failure to garner a Best Picture nomination was criticised by the media. Beginning in 2010, the Academy increased their Best Picture nominees from five to ten, a change known as \"The Dark Knight Rule\".[92] Nolan received many awards and nominations for his work on the film.[40] In the late 2000s, Nolan was reported to direct a film adaptation of the 1960s television series *The Prisoner*.[54]\n\n\nThe success of *The Dark Knight* allowed Warner Bros. to sign Nolan to write, direct and co-produce *Inception* (2010) \u2013 a film for which he had the idea around nine years before its release.[93] Nolan described the film as \"a contemporary sci-fi actioner set within the architecture of the mind\".[94] Starring a large ensemble cast led by Leonardo DiCaprio, the film became a critical and commercial success upon its release.[95] Film critic Mark Kermode named it the best film of 2010, stating \"*Inception* is proof that people are not stupid, that cinema is not trash, and that it is possible for blockbusters and art to be the same thing.\"[96] Philosophy professor David Kyle Johnson wrote that \"*Inception* became a classic almost as soon as it was projected on silver screens\", praising its exploration of philosophical ideas, including leap of faith and allegory of the cave.[97] The film grossed over $836\u00a0million worldwide.[98] Nominated for eight Academy Awards\u2014including Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay\u2014it won Best Cinematography, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing and Best Visual Effects.[99] Nolan was nominated for a BAFTA Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Director, among other accolades.[40]\n\n\n\n![Christopher Nolan is looking directly towards the camera.](image)Nolan at the 2013 premiere of *Man of Steel* in London\nAround the release of *The Dark Knight Rises* (2012), Nolan's third and final Batman film, Joseph Bevan of the British Film Institute wrote a profile on him: \"In the space of just over a decade, Christopher Nolan has shot from promising British indie director to undisputed master of a new brand of intelligent escapism.\"[100] After initial hesitation, Nolan agreed to return to direct *The Dark Knight Rises* and worked with his brother and David S. Goyer to develop a story that he felt would end the trilogy on a high note.[101] The film was released to positive reviews;[102] Kenneth Turan found the film \"potent, persuasive and hypnotic\" and \"more than an exceptional superhero movie, it is masterful filmmaking by any standard\".[103] Christy Lemire of *HuffPost* wrote in her review that Nolan concluded his trilogy in a \"typically spectacular, ambitious fashion\", but disliked the \"overloaded\" story and excessive grimness.[104] *The Dark Knight Rises* was a box office success, becoming the thirteenth film to gross $1\u00a0billion.[105] During a midnight showing of the film in Aurora, Colorado, a gunman opened fire inside the theatre, killing 12 people and injuring 58 others.[106] Nolan released a statement expressing his condolences for the victims of what he described as a \"senseless tragedy\".[107]\n\n\n*The Dark Knight* trilogy inspired a trend in future superhero films seeking to replicate its gritty, realistic tone to little success. The second instalment in particular revitalised the genre at a time when recent superhero films had failed to meet expectations.[108][109] Ben Child of *The Guardian* wrote that the three films \"will remain thrilling totems of the genre for decades to come\".[108] During story discussions for *The Dark Knight Rises*, Goyer told Nolan of his idea about *Man of Steel* (2013), which the latter would produce.[110] Impressed with Zack Snyder's work in *300* (2006) and *Watchmen* (2009), Nolan hired him to direct the film.[111] Starring Henry Cavill as Clark Kent who learns that he is a powerful alien, *Man of Steel* received mixed reviews and grossed more than $660\u00a0million against a budget of $220\u00a0million.[112][113]\n\n\n\n### 2014\u20132019: *Interstellar*, *Dunkirk* and other activities[edit]\n\n\n![Jonathan Nolan looking to his left](image)Nolan and his younger brother, Jonathan (*pictured* in 2017), wrote several screenplays together, including that of *Interstellar*.\nNolan next directed, wrote and produced the science-fiction film *Interstellar* (2014). The first drafts of the script were written by Jonathan Nolan, and it was originally to be directed by Steven Spielberg.[114] Based on the scientific theories of theoretical physicist Kip Thorne, the film follows a group of astronauts who travel through a wormhole in search of a new home for humanity.[115] In a 2014 discussion of the film's physics, Nolan expressed his admiration for scientific objectivity, wishing it were applied \"in every aspect of our civilisation\".[116] *Interstellar* \u2013 starring Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain \u2013 was released to positive reviews and grossed $773\u00a0million worldwide.[117][118] Observing its \"visual dazzle, thematic ambition\", *The New York Times*'s A. O. Scott wrote that *Interstellar* is a \"sweeping, futuristic adventure driven by grief, dread and regret\".[119] Documentary filmmaker Toni Myers called the film \"a real work of art\" and praised it for exploring a story spanning multiple generations.[120] *Interstellar* was particularly praised for its scientific accuracy, which led to the publication of two academic papers.[121][122] The *American Journal of Physics* called for it to be shown in school science lessons.[123][124] At the 87th Academy Awards, the film won Best Visual Effects and received four other nominations.[125] Also in 2014, Nolan and Emma Thomas served as executive producers on *Transcendence*, the directorial debut of his longtime cinematographer Wally Pfister.[126]\n\n\nIn the mid-2010s, Nolan took part in several ventures for film preservation and distribution of the work of lesser-known filmmakers. His production company, Syncopy, formed a joint venture with Zeitgeist Films to release Blu-ray editions of Zeitgeist's films.[127] As a part of the Blu-ray release of the animation films of the Brothers Quay, Nolan directed the documentary short *Quay* (2015). He initiated a theatrical tour, showcasing the Quays' *In Absentia*, *The Comb* and *Street of Crocodiles*. IndieWire wrote that the brothers \"will undoubtedly have hundreds, if not thousands more fans because of Nolan, and for that *The Quay Brothers in 35mm* will always be one of [the] latter's most important contributions to cinema\".[128][129] An advocate for the survival of the analogue medium, Nolan and visual artist Tacita Dean invited representatives from leading American film archives, laboratories and presenting institutions to participate in an informal summit entitled *Reframing the Future of Film* at the Getty Museum in March 2015.[130][131] Subsequent events were held at Tate Modern in London, Museo Tamayo in Mexico City and Tata Theatre in Mumbai.[132] In April 2015, Nolan joined the board of directors of The Film Foundation, a non-profitable organisation dedicated to film preservation,[133] and was appointed, along with Martin Scorsese, by the Library of Congress to serve on the National Film Preservation Board as DGA representatives.[134] Nolan serves on the Motion Picture & Television Fund Board of Governors.[135]\n\n\nAfter serving as an executive producer on Zack Snyder's *Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice* (2016) and *Justice League* (2017),[136][137] Nolan returned to directing with *Dunkirk* (2017). Based on his own original screenplay and co-produced with Thomas, the film is set amid World War II in 1940 and the evacuation of Allied soldiers from the beaches of Dunkirk, France. Describing the film as a survival tale with a triptych structure, Nolan wanted to make a \"sensory, almost experimental movie\" with minimal dialogue.[138] He said he waited to make *Dunkirk* until he had earned the trust of a major studio to let him make it as a British film but with an American budget.[139] Before filming, Nolan sought advice from Spielberg, who later said in an interview with *Variety*, \"knowing and respecting that Chris [Nolan] is one of the world's most imaginative filmmakers, my advice to him was to leave his imagination, as I did on *Ryan*, in second position to the research he was doing to authentically acquit this historical drama\".[140] Starring an ensemble cast,[141] *Dunkirk* was released to widespread critical acclaim and strong box office results.[142][143][144] It grossed over $526\u00a0million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing World War\u00a0II film of all time.[145] In his review, Mick LaSalle of the *San Francisco Chronicle* wrote: \"It's one of the best war films ever made, distinct in its look, in its approach and in the effect it has on viewers. There are movies\u2014they are rare\u2014that lift you out of your present circumstances and immerse you so fully in another experience that you watch in a state of jaw-dropped awe. *Dunkirk* is that kind of movie.\"[146] The film received many accolades, including Nolan's first Oscar nomination for Best Director.[147]\n\n\n\n![A picture showing five people standing on a red carpet](image)Nolan (right) with Keir Dullea, Katharina Kubrick, Ron Sanders and Jan Harlan at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival\nIn 2018, Nolan supervised a new 70\u00a0mm print of Stanley Kubrick's *2001: A Space Odyssey* (1968), made from the original camera negative; he presented it at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival.[148] *USA Today* observed that festival-goers greeted Nolan \"like a rock star with a standing ovation\".[149] A year later, Nolan and Thomas received executive producer credits on *The Doll's Breath* (2019), an animated short directed by the Quay brothers.[150]\n\n\n\n### 2020\u2013present: *Tenet* and *Oppenheimer*[edit]\n\n\nNolan's next film was the science fiction film *Tenet* (2020), described by Tom Shone of *The Sunday Times* as \"a globe-spinning riff on all things Nolanesque\".[151] Nolan had worked on the screenplay for more than five years after deliberating about its central ideas for over a decade.[152] Delayed three times due to the COVID-19 pandemic, *Tenet* was the first Hollywood tent-pole to open in theatres after the pandemic shutdown.[153] The film tells the story of an unnamed protagonist (played by John David Washington) who travels through time to stop a world-threatening attack.[154] It grossed $363\u00a0million worldwide on a production budget of $200\u00a0million, becoming Nolan's first to underperform at the box-office.[155] *Tenet* was described as his most polarising film; critics praised the direction but found its story confusing.[156][147] Peter Bradshaw of *The Guardian* awarded it five out of five, calling it \"a cerebral cadenza, a deadpan flourish of crazy implausibility\u2014but supercharged with steroidal energy and imagination\".[157] Leslie Felperin of *The Hollywood Reporter* described it as \"a chilly, cerebral film\u2014easy to admire, especially since it's so rich in audacity and originality, but almost impossible to love, lacking as it is in a certain humanity\".[158] At the 93rd Academy Awards, the film won Best Visual Effects and was nominated for Best Production Design.[159] Following the release of *Tenet*, Nolan joined the Advisory Board of the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers.[160] He served as an executive producer on *Zack Snyder's Justice League* (2021), a director's cut of 2017's *Justice League*.[161]\n\n\nNolan's 12th film was *Oppenheimer* (2023), a biopic based on J. Robert Oppenheimer (played by Cillian Murphy) and his role in the development of the atom bomb.[162] It was Nolan's first R-rated film since *Insomnia* (2002).[163] The film was financed and distributed by Universal Pictures, making it Nolan's first since *Memento* that was not made for Warner Bros. He was disillusioned with Warner Bros.' decision to simultaneously release their films in theatres and on HBO Max.[164] Nolan secured the deal with Universal after he was promised a production budget of around $100\u00a0million with an equal marketing budget, total creative control, 20 per cent of first-dollar gross, a 100-day theatrical window and a blackout period from the studio wherein the company would not release another film three weeks before or after *Oppenheimer*'s release.[165] The film received critical acclaim.[166] Matthew Jackson of *The A.V. Club* wrote, \"*Oppenheimer* deserves the title of masterpiece. It's Christopher Nolan's best film so far, a step up to a new level for one of our finest filmmakers, and a movie that burns itself into your brain.\"[167] Terming it \"boldly imaginative and [Nolan's] most mature work yet\", BBC Culture's Caryn James added that it combined the \"explosive, commercially-enticing action of *The Dark Knight* trilogy\" with the \"cerebral underpinnings\" of *Memento*, *Inception* and *Tenet*.[168] *Oppenheimer* has grossed $950\u00a0million worldwide, making it the third-highest-grossing film of 2023.[169]\n\n\n\n## Personal life and public image[edit]\n\n\n![Christopher Nolan, on the right, is looking directly towards the camera as Emma Thomas is looking to her right.](image)Nolan and his wife Emma Thomas in January 2011\nNolan is married to Emma Thomas, whom he met at University College London when he was 19.[9][16] She has worked as a producer on all of his films since 1997.[43][170] The couple have four children and reside in Los Angeles.[171]\n\n\nRarely granting promotional interviews about his films, Nolan prefers to maintain a certain level of mystery about his work.[172] Refusing to discuss his personal life,[173] he feels that too much biographical information about a filmmaker detracts from the experience of his audiences. \"I actually don't want people to have me in mind at all when they're watching the films.\"[172]\n\n\n\n## Filmmaking style[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cinematic style of Christopher Nolan\n\nNolan's films are majorly centred in metaphysical themes, exploring the concepts of time, memory and personal identity.[174][175] His work is characterised by mathematically-inspired ideas and images, unconventional narrative structures, materialistic perspectives, and evocative use of music and sound.[d] Filmmaker Guillermo del Toro called Nolan \"an emotional mathematician\".[180] BBC's arts editor Will Gompertz described him as \"an art house auteur making intellectually ambitious blockbuster movies that can leave your pulse racing and your head spinning\".[181] Joseph Bevan wrote, \"His films allow arthouse regulars to enjoy superhero flicks and multiplex crowds to engage with labyrinthine plot conceits.\"[100] Nolan views himself as \"an indie filmmaker working inside the studio system\".[182]\n\n\n\n> \n> \"Christopher Nolan doesn't make sense. And that is exactly how he likes it. In twenty-three years and through twelve films, he has defied the laws of Hollywood by creating startling, original genre pieces that have revelled in their own complexity, confounding every maxim by which the studios hope to appeal to the widest audience. And yet he does that too. Cinemas fill on the possibility of the next Nolan film. Whatever form it might take.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014Film author Ian Nathan on Nolan as a filmmaker (2022)[183]\n\nIn the sixteen-essay book *The Philosophy of Christopher Nolan*, professional philosophers and writers analysed Nolan's work; they identified themes of self-destruction, the nature and value of the truth, and the political mindset of the hero and villain, among others.[184] Robbie B. H. Goh, a professor of English literature, described Nolan as a \"philosophical filmmaker\" who includes philosophical ideas\u2014existentialism, morality, epistemology and the distinction between appearance and reality\u2014in films that frequently portray suspense, action and violence. Goh appreciated his ability to incorporate such themes in films that possess \"elements of the Hollywood blockbuster\"\u2014which help keep the audiences engaged\u2014but simultaneously remain \"more thoughtful and self-reflexive than the typical consumerist action film\".[185] He further wrote that Nolan's body of work reflect \"a heterogeneity of conditions of products\" extending from low-budget films to lucrative blockbusters, \"a wide range of genres and settings\" and \"a diversity of styles that trumpet his versatility\".[186]\n\n\nDavid Bordwell, a film theorist, wrote that Nolan has been able to blend his \"experimental impulses\" with the demands of mainstream entertainment, describing his oeuvre as \"experiments with cinematic time by means of techniques of subjective viewpoint and crosscutting\".[187] Nolan's use of practical, in-camera effects, miniatures and models, as well as shooting on celluloid film, has been highly influential in early 21st century cinema.[188][189] IndieWire wrote in 2019 that, Nolan \"kept a viable alternate model of big-budget filmmaking alive\", in an era where blockbuster filmmaking has become \"a largely computer-generated art form\".[189] Because of Nolan's deep involvement in the technical facet of his films, Stuart Joy described him as a \"complete filmmaker\", who \"oversees all aspects of production while also managing cultural and industrial factors outside of the text\".[190]\n\n\n\n## Recognition[edit]\n\n\nNolan has made some of the most influential and popular films of his time.[e] Many of his films have been regarded by critics as among the best of their respective decades,[42][195][196] and according to *The Wall Street Journal*, his \"ability to combine box-office success with artistic ambition has given him an extraordinary amount of clout in the industry\".[197] His films have earned more than $6\u00a0billion.[198] Nolan's films *Memento* and *The Dark Knight* have been selected by the US Library of Congress to be preserved in the National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically\" significant.[199][200] These films and *Inception* appeared in BBC's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century and *The Hollywood Reporter*'s poll of best films ever made.[201][202] In 2017, *The Dark Knight*, *Inception* and *Interstellar* featured in *Empire* magazine's poll of \"The 100 Greatest Movies\".[203] In 2018, *The Hollywood Reporter* listed Nolan as one of the 100 most powerful people in entertainment and described him as a \"franchise unto himself\".[204] *Parade* ranked Nolan number eight in its 2022 list of 75 Best Movie Directors of All Time.[205]\n\n\n\n![Four-color National Film Registry logo on black background](image)Two of Nolan's films (*Memento* and *The Dark Knight*) have been selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry.[199][200]\nNolan's work has been as \"intensely embraced, analysed and debated by ordinary film fans as by critics and film academics\".[173][206] Calling him \"a persuasively inventive storyteller\", Geoff Andrew of the British Film Institute named Nolan one of the few contemporary filmmakers producing highly personal films within the Hollywood mainstream. Andrew wrote that Nolan's films are \"not so much [notable] for their considerable technical virtuosity and visual flair as for their brilliant narrative ingenuity and their unusually adult interest in complex philosophical questions\".[207] David Bordwell observed that Nolan is \"considered one of the most accomplished living filmmakers\", citing his ability to turn genre movies into both art and event films, as well as his box office numbers, critical acclaim and popularity among cinemagoers.[187][208] In 2008, Philip French deemed Nolan \"the first major talent to emerge this [21st] century\".[209] Mark Kermode complimented Nolan for bringing \"the discipline and ethics of art-house independent moviemaking and apply[ing] them to Hollywood blockbusters. He's living proof that you don't have to appeal to the lowest common denominator to be profitable\".[210] *The Observer*'s Ryan Gilbey described Nolan as a \"skillful, stylish storyteller, capable of combining the spectacle of Spielberg with the intellectual intricacy of Nicolas Roeg or Alain Resnais\".[211] Mark Cousins applauded Nolan for embracing big ideas, \"Hollywood filmmakers generally shy away from ideas\u2014but not Christopher Nolan\".[212] Scott Foundas of *Variety* declared Nolan \"the premier big-canvas storyteller of his generation\",[213] and Justin Chang of the *Los Angeles Times* called him \"the great proceduralist of 21st century blockbuster filmmaking, a lover of nuts-and-bolts minutiae\".[214]\n\n\nNolan has been praised by many of his contemporaries, and his work has influenced them.[215][216][217] Kenneth Branagh called Nolan's approach to large-scale filmmaking \"unique in modern cinema\", adding, \"regardless of how popular his movies become, he remains an artist and an auteur. I think for that reason he has become a heroic figure for both the audience and the people working behind the camera.\"[218] Michael Mann complimented Nolan for his \"singular vision\" and credited with \"invent[ing] the post-heroic superhero\".[219] Nicolas Roeg said of Nolan, \"People talk about 'commercial art' and the term is usually self-negating; Nolan works in the commercial arena and yet there's something very poetic about his work.\"[220] Martin Scorsese identified Nolan as a filmmaker creating \"beautifully made films on a big scale\".[221]\n\n\nDamien Chazelle lauded Nolan for his ability \"to make the most seemingly impersonal projects\u2014superhero epics, deep-space mind-benders\u2014feel deeply personal\".[222] Discussing the difference between art films and big studio blockbusters, Steven Spielberg referred to Nolan's *Dark Knight* series as an example of both;[223] he has described *Memento* and *Inception* as \"masterworks\".[224] Denis Villeneuve was impressed by Nolan's ability \"to keep his identity and create his own universe in that large scope\u00a0... To bring intellectual concepts and to bring them in that scope to the screen right now\u2014it's very rare. Every movie that he comes out with, I have more admiration for his work.\"[225] James Cameron expressed disappointment that Nolan was not nominated for an Academy Award as Best Director for *Inception*, calling it \"the most astounding piece of film creation and direction of the year, hands down\".[224]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Christopher Nolan filmography\n\n* *Following* (1998)\n* *Memento* (2000)\n* *Insomnia* (2002)\n* *Batman Begins* (2005)\n* *The Prestige* (2006)\n* *The Dark Knight* (2008)\n* *Inception* (2010)\n* *The Dark Knight Rises* (2012)\n* *Interstellar* (2014)\n* *Dunkirk* (2017)\n* *Tenet* (2020)\n* *Oppenheimer* (2023)\n\n## Awards and honours[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of awards and nominations received by Christopher Nolan\n\n![A hand and footprint reading \"Christopher Nolan\" at the top and \"7/7/2012\" at the bottom.](image)Nolan's hand and shoeprints in front of the Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood\nNolan has been nominated for five Academy Awards, five British Academy Film Awards and six Golden Globe Awards.[40][226][227][228] Nolan was named an Honorary Fellow of UCL in 2006,[229] and conferred an honorary doctorate in literature in 2017.[230] From 2011 to 2014, he appeared in *Forbes* Celebrity 100 list based on his income and popularity.[231] In 2012, he became the youngest director to receive a hand-and-footprint ceremony at Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles.[232] Nolan appeared in *Time*'s 100 most influential people in the world in 2015.[233] He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 2019 New Year Honours for services to film.[234] In 2023, he was awarded the Federation of American Scientists' Public Service Award for his depiction of scientists in his film *Oppenheimer*.[235]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Nolan has continued his collaboration with the Belic brothers, receiving a credit for his editorial assistance on their Oscar-nominated documentary *Genghis Blues* (1999).[11]\n2. **^** The name of the company is derived from syncope, a medical term for fainting.

Best known for his work in action films, he directed the second of the *Transporter* films (2002\u20132005), *The Incredible Hulk* (2008), *Clash of the Titans* (2010), *Now You See Me* (2013), and the tenth *Fast & Furious* installment, *Fast X* (2023). He also directed the streaming television series *The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance* (2019).\n\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nIn 1997, he assisted Jean-Pierre Jeunet on the set of *Alien Resurrection*. On returning to France, he worked with Luc Besson on the production of commercials for Club Internet and L'Or\u00e9al as well as on the film *Joan of Arc*. He also collaborated, as the second assistant director, with Alain Chabat on the production of *Ast\u00e9rix & Ob\u00e9lix: Mission Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre* (2002).\n\n\nLater in 2002, Louis Leterrier directed *The Transporter*, an action movie starring Jason Statham. Although the US release lists him as artistic director and Corey Yuen as director, the opening credits of the European release grant him directorial credit and list Yuen as action director. Leterrier later entered the so-called \"Besson stable\" \u2013 a group of directors working on films produced by or associated with Luc Besson \u2013 alongside Chris Nahon and Pierre Morel. He directed Jet Li in *Unleashed*, his solo debut feature, a full-length martial arts film (2004). Luc Besson then entrusted him with directorial control of *Transporter 2*, set this time in Miami.[2]\n\n\nIn 2008, as part of a wave of French directors employed in Hollywood, he directed his first big-budget American film, *The Incredible Hulk*. His next project, a remake of the 1981 *Clash of the Titans* produced by Warner Bros., was released on 2 April 2010. Leterrier had mentioned that he would like to create a *Clash of the Titans* franchise, should the latest film prove to be successful.[3][4] However, in June 2010, Jonathan Liebesman was named as director of the sequel, leaving Leterrier's involvement in future films in doubt.[5]\n\n\nLeterrier directed the spy comedy film *Grimsby* (2016), written by, and starring, Sacha Baron Cohen.[6] In March 2015, *Deadline Hollywood* reported that Leterrier was in talks to direct the shark thriller film *In the Deep*, for Sony Pictures Entertainment.[7] However, on 3 June 2015, TheWrap reported that Leterrier had exited the film due to creative differences and the reduction of the previously told budget.[8]\n\n\nIn 2019, Leterrier directed the first season of *The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance* for Netflix, a prequel series to *The Dark Crystal* consisting of ten hour-long episodes.\n\n\nIn May 2022, Leterrier announced that he will be directing *Fast X*, the tenth installment of the *Fast & Furious* franchise, replacing series director Justin Lin, who retained producing and writing credits.[9] In April 2023, it was announced Leterrier would direct the eleventh film in the series.[10]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n### Feature films[edit]\n\n\n**Director**\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2005\n | *Unleashed* |  |\n| *Transporter 2* |  |\n| 2008\n | *The Incredible Hulk* |  |\n| 2010\n | *Clash of the Titans* |  |\n| 2013\n | *Now You See Me* |  |\n| 2016\n | *Grimsby* |  |\n| 2022\n | *The Takedown* |  |\n| 2023\n | *Fast X* | Replaced Justin Lin[11] |\n| 2025\n | Untitled *Fast X* sequel\n |  |\n\n\n**Executive producer**\n\n\n\n* *Wrath of the Titans* (2012)\n* *Now You See Me 2* (2016)\n\n\n**Producer**\n\n\n\n* *Strays* (2023)\n\n\n**Acting roles**\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2002\n | *Asterix & Obelix: Mission Cleopatra* | Ouh\u00e9charlis\n |  |\n| 2010\n | *Clash of the Titans* | Kraken\n | Uncredited role\n |\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Director\n | ExecutiveProducer\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2017\n | *Tycoon* | Yes\n | Yes\n | 9 episodes\n |\n| 2019\n | *The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance* | Yes\n | Yes\n | 10 episodes\n |\n| 2021\n | *Lupin* | Yes\n | No\n | 3 episodes\n |\n| TBA\n | *Dark Matter* | Yes\n | Yes\n | TBA\n |\n\n\n### Other credits[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1992\n | *The Son of the Mekong* | Trainee\n |\n| 1997\n | *Alien Resurrection* | On-set production assistant\n |\n| 1998\n | *Restons group\u00e9s* | Second assistant director\n |\n| 1999\n | *The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc* | Production assistant\n |\n| 2002\n | *Asterix & Obelix: Mission Cleopatra* | Second assistant director\n |\n| *The Idol* |\n| *The Transporter* | Artistic director\n |\n| 2016\n | *Ares* | Co-producer\n |\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Soghomonian, Talia (12 January 2011). \"Louis Leterrier's Wife B\u00e9atrice to Direct WRECKING BALL; Eva Mendes to Star\". *Collider*.

Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHigh-grossing films by year of release[47][48][49]\n| Year\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross\n | Budget\n | Reference(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1915 | *The Birth of a Nation* | $50,000,000\u2013100,000,000$20,000,000+R ($5,200,000)R | $110,000 | [# 84][# 85][# 86] |\n| 1916 | *Intolerance* | $1,750,000R IN | $385,907 | [50][51] |\n| 1917 | *Cleopatra* | $500,000\\*R | $300,000 | [# 87][# 88] |\n| 1918 | *Mickey* | $8,000,000 | $250,000 | [# 89] |\n| 1919 | *The Miracle Man* | $3,000,000R | $120,000 | [# 90] |\n| 1920 | *Way Down East* | $5,000,000R ($4,000,000)R | $800,000 | [# 91][# 92] |\n| 1921 | *The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse* | $5,000,000R ($4,000,000)R | $600,000\u2013800,000 | [# 93] |\n| 1922 | *Douglas Fairbanks in Robin Hood* | $2,500,000R | $930,042.78 | [# 94][# 95] |\n| 1923 | *The Covered Wagon* | $5,000,000R | $800,000 | [# 96][# 97] |\n| 1924 | *The Sea Hawk* | $3,000,000R | $700,000 | [# 96] |\n| 1925 | *The Big Parade* | $18,000,000\u201322,000,000R  ($6,131,000)R | $382,000 | [# 98][# 99][# 100] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 2021 | *Spider-Man: No Way Home* | $1,921,847,111 ($1,912,233,593)\n | $200,000,000\n | [# 13][# 306] |\n| 2022 | *Avatar: The Way of Water* | $2,320,250,281\n | $350,000,000\u2013460,000,000 | [# 5][# 307][# 308] |\n| 2023 | *Barbie* \u2020\n | $1,441,740,954\n | $128,000,000\u2013145,000,000 | [# 26][# 27] |\n\n\n(...)

Included on the list are charts of the top box-office earners (ranked by both the nominal and real value of their revenue), a chart of high-grossing films by calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing film franchises and series.

Estimates depend on the price index used to adjust the grosses,[31] and the exchange rates used to convert between currencies can also affect the calculations, both of which can have an effect on the ultimate rankings of an inflation adjusted list. *Gone with the Wind*\u2014first released in 1939\u2014is generally considered to be the most successful film, with *Guinness World Records* in 2014 estimating its adjusted global gross at $3.4\u00a0billion. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPrior to 2000, only seven film series had grossed over $1\u00a0billion at the box office: *James Bond*,[98] *Star Wars*,[99] *Indiana Jones*,[100] *Rocky*,[101][102][103] *Batman*,[104] *Jurassic Park*,[105] and *Star Trek*.[106] Since the turn of the century, that number has increased to over ninety (not including one-off hits such as *Titanic* and *Zootopia*).[107] This is partly due to inflation and market growth, but it is also due to Hollywood's adoption of the franchise model: films that have built-in brand recognition such as being based on a well-known literary source or an established character. The methodology is based on the concept that films associated with things audiences are already familiar with can be more effectively marketed to them, and as such are known as \"pre-sold\" films within the industry.[108]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n22. **^** \"Top Gun: Maverick (2022)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

The most successful superhero film, *Avengers: Endgame*, is also the second-highest-grossing film on the nominal earnings chart, and there are four films in total based on the *Avengers* comic books charting in the top twenty. Other Marvel Comics adaptations have also had success with the *Spider-Man* and *X-Men* properties, while films based on *Batman* and *Superman* from DC Comics have generally performed well. *Star Wars* is also represented in the nominal earnings chart with five films, while the *Jurassic Park* franchise features prominently.

Since the Cinerama corporation owned the theaters there were no rental fees for the films, meaning the studio received 100% of the box-office gross, unlike the case with most other films where the distributor typically receives less than half the gross. Since *Variety* at the time ranked films by their U.S. and Canadian rental, they constructed a hypothetical rental figure for the Cinerama films to provide a basis for comparison to other films in their chart: in the case of *This Is Cinerama*, the $50\u00a0million worldwide gross was reconfigured as a $12.5\u00a0million U.S. rental gross; this is exactly 25% of the amount reported by Cinerama, so *Variety*'s formula seemingly halved the gross to obtain an estimate for the U.S. share, and halved it again to simulate a rental fee.[62] All five Cinerama features collectively generated $120\u00a0million in worldwide box office receipts.[63]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 18\n | *Shrek* | $4,018,773,230\n | 6\n | $669,795,538\n | *Shrek 2* ($928,760,770)\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Main series | $2,979,138,235\n | 4\n | $744,784,559\n | *Shrek 2* ($928,760,770)\n |\n| 1\n | *Shrek 2* (2004) | $928,760,770 |\n| 2\n | *Shrek the Third* (2007) | $813,367,380 |\n| 3\n | *Shrek Forever After* (2010) | $752,600,867 |\n| 4\n | *Shrek* (2001) | $484,409,218\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *Puss in Boots* series | $1,039,634,995\n | 2\n | $519,817,498\n | *Puss in Boots* ($554,987,477)\n |\n| 1\n | *Puss in Boots* (2011) | $554,987,477 |\n| 2\n | *The Last Wish* (2022) | $484,647,518\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n88. **^** Kilday, Gregg (July 5, 1977). \"Director of 'Jaws II' Abandons His 'Ship'\". *The Victoria Advocate*. p.\u00a06B.\n89. **^** New York (AP) (May 26, 1978). \"Scariness of Jaws 2 unknown quantity\". *The StarPhoenix*. p.\u00a021.\n90. **^** Fenner, Pat C.

Produced at a cost of $1\u00a0million, *This is Cinerama* ran 122 weeks, earning $4.7\u00a0million in its initial New York run alone and eventually grossed over $32\u00a0million. It was obvious to Hollywood that the public was ready for a new form of motion picture entertainment. The first five Cinerama feature-length travelogues, though they only played in twenty-two theaters, pulled in a combined gross of $82\u00a0million.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFollowing the outbreak of World War II, many of the foreign markets were unavailable to Hollywood so it became standard practice to just report on North American box-office performance.[56] In keeping with this new approach, the North American rental for *Gone with the Wind* was revised to $21\u00a0million in 1947 ($11\u00a0million lower than the previous figure),[58] and as of 1953\u2014following the 1947 re-release\u2014*Variety* was reporting earnings of $26\u00a0million.[59] Through 1956, MGM reported cumulative North American earnings of $30,015,000 and foreign earnings of $18,964,000, from three releases.[60] Worldwide rentals of $32\u00a0million from the initial release is consistent with the revised figures and later reported worldwide figures: they indicate that the film earned $21\u00a0million in North America and $11\u00a0million overseas from the initial release, and added a further $9\u00a0million in North America and $8\u00a0million overseas from subsequent re-releases up to 1956.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* Monaco, Paul (2010). *A History of American Movies: A Film-By-Film Look at the Art, Craft, and Business of Cinema*.

Contemporary accounts often list it as earning $32\u00a0million in North American rentals and retrospective charts have often duplicated this claim; however, it is likely this was the worldwide rental figure. Trade journals would collate the data by either obtaining it from the distributors themselves, who were keen to promote a successful film, or by surveying theaters and constructing an estimate. Distributors would often report the worldwide rental since the higher figure made the film appear more successful, while estimates were limited to performance in North America; therefore it was not unusual for worldwide and North American rentals to be mixed up. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAnother complication is release in multiple formats for which different ticket prices are charged. One notable example of this phenomenon is *Avatar*, which was also released in 3D and IMAX: almost two-thirds of tickets for that film were for 3D showings with an average price of $10, and about one-sixth were for IMAX showings with an average price over $14.50, compared to a 2010 average price of $7.61 for 2D films.[25] Social and economic factors such as population change[26] and the growth of international markets[27][28][29] also have an effect on the number of people purchasing theater tickets, along with audience demographics where some films sell a much higher proportion of discounted children's tickets, or perform better in big cities where tickets cost more.[23]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSteven Spielberg is the most represented director on the chart, with six films to his credit, occupying the top spot in 1975, 1981, 1982, 1984, 1989 and 1993. Cecil B. DeMille (1932, 1947, 1949, 1952 and 1956) is in second place with five films and William Wyler (1942, 1946, 1959 and 1968) and James Cameron (1991, 1997, 2009 and 2022) are tied for third place with four films. D. W. Griffith (1915, 1916 and 1920), George Roy Hill (1966, 1969 and 1973) and the Russo brothers (2016, 2018 and 2019) all feature heavily with three films apiece. George Lucas directed two chart-toppers in 1977 and 1999, but also served in a strong creative capacity as a producer and writer in 1980, 1981, 1983, 1984 and 1989 as well. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAnother film purported to have been the highest-grosser is the 1972 pornographic film *Deep Throat*. In 1984, Linda Lovelace testified to a United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on juvenile justice that the film had earned $600\u00a0million;[82] this figure has been the subject of much speculation, since if it is accurate then the film would have made more money than *Star Wars*, and finished the 1970s as the highest-grossing film. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n86. **^** Bartel, Pauline (1989). *The Complete Gone with the Wind Trivia Book: The Movie and More*.

The prints were battered, but the studio believed one final fling for GWTW was possible. The film returned to movie theaters for the third time in the spring of 1942 and stayed in release until late 1943 ... When MGM finally pulled the film from exhibition, all worn-out prints were destroyed, and GWTW was at last declared out of circulation.

It is the sequel to *Guardians of the Galaxy* (2014) and *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2* (2017), and the 32nd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Written and directed by James Gunn, it features an ensemble cast including Chris Pratt, Zoe Salda\u00f1a, Dave Bautista, Karen Gillan, Pom Klementieff, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper, Will Poulter, Sean Gunn, Chukwudi Iwuji, Linda Cardellini, Nathan Fillion, and Sylvester Stallone. In the film, the Guardians must protect Rocket (Cooper) from the High Evolutionary (Iwuji).\n\n\nGunn stated in November 2014 that he had initial ideas for a third and final film in the series, and announced his return to write and direct in April 2017. Disney fired him from the film in July 2018 following the resurfacing of controversial posts on Twitter, but the studio reversed course by that October and reinstated him. Gunn's return was publicly revealed in March 2019, with production resuming after he completed work for DC on *The Suicide Squad* (2021) and the first season of its spin-off series *Peacemaker* (2022). Filming began in November 2021 at Trilith Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, and lasted until May 2022.\n\n\n*Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3* premiered at Disneyland Paris on April 22, 2023, and was released in the United States on May 5, as part of Phase Five of the MCU. Like its predecessors, it was a critical and commercial success. Critics praised the film for Gunn's direction and screenplay, its visuals, soundtrack, performances, action sequences, emotional weight and humor; many deemed the film as a satisfactory conclusion to the trilogy. It grossed over $845\u00a0million worldwide, becoming the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2023.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nAt their new headquarters on Knowhere,[a] the Guardians of the Galaxy are attacked by Adam Warlock, a Sovereign warrior created by High Priestess Ayesha, who seeks to destroy them for stealing from her.[b] After critically wounding Rocket, Adam is stabbed by Nebula, and flees. The Guardians' med-packs are useless at healing Rocket's wounds, who has a kill switch embedded in him by Orgocorp, a company helmed by the High Evolutionary, Rocket's creator. The Guardians travel to Orgocorp's headquarters to find the switch's override code and save Rocket's life.\n\n\nAs Rocket lies unconscious, he recalls his past. As a baby, he was experimented on by the High Evolutionary, who sought to enhance and anthropomorphize animal lifeforms to create an ideal society called Counter-Earth. Rocket befriended his fellow Batch 89 test subjects: the otter Lylla, the walrus Teefs, and the rabbit Floor. The High Evolutionary was impressed by Rocket's growing intelligence but became furious once it exceeded his own. The High Evolutionary used Rocket to perfect his Humanimal creations, then planned to harvest Rocket's brain for further research and exterminate the obsolete Batch 89. Rocket freed his friends, but the High Evolutionary killed Lylla. Enraged, Rocket mauled the High Evolutionary, whose henchmen killed Teefs and Floor in the ensuing firefight. Rocket eventually fled Counter-Earth in a spaceship.\n\n\nIn the present, the Ravagers, including an alternate version of Gamora,[c] help the Guardians infiltrate Orgocorp. They retrieve Rocket's file but discover that the code was removed, with the likely culprit being Theel, one of the High Evolutionary's advisors. The Guardians, along with Gamora, depart for Counter-Earth to find him. They are followed by Ayesha and Adam after the High Evolutionary, their race's creator, threatened to wipe out the Sovereign if they fail to retrieve Rocket. The Guardians reach Counter-Earth and are guided to the Ar\u00eate Laboratories complex. Drax and Mantis remain with Gamora and Rocket as Peter Quill, Groot, and Nebula travel to Ar\u00eate. Nebula is forced to wait outside by guards as Quill and Groot enter Ar\u00eate, while Drax tricks Mantis into pursuing Quill's group. Gamora saves Rocket from being captured by Adam and the High Evolutionary's guard War Pig.\n\n\nQuestioned by Quill, the High Evolutionary admits disillusionment with Counter-Earth\u2019s imperfect society, so he destroys the planet, killing the Humanimals as well as Ayesha. Ar\u00eate departs as a spaceship, with Nebula, Drax and Mantis boarding to rescue Quill and Groot, who instead escape Ar\u00eate with Theel, who they kill, before retrieving the code from his corpse and being rescued by Gamora in their ship. As Quill's group uses the code, Rocket flatlines and has a near-death experience, in which he reunites with Lylla, Teefs, and Floor. He learns from Lylla that his time has not yet come, as Quill uses the code to disable the kill switch and restart Rocket's heart.\n\n\nDrax, Nebula, and Mantis encounter several genetically modified humanoid children on Ar\u00eate before being captured. The other Guardians stage a rescue mission, leading to a battle against the High Evolutionary's forces. Kraglin fires on Ar\u00eate with Knowhere, dooming Ar\u00eate, then helps to save Knowhere's citizens from a counter-attack by the High Evolutionary's Hellspawn. Intent on retreat, the High Evolutionary's crew mutiny only to be killed by their leader. Drax, Nebula, and Mantis befriend three monstrous Abilisks to escape and reunite with Quill's group. The Guardians delay leaving Ar\u00eate, choosing to rescue the Star Children, who escape to Knowhere via a tunnel constructed by Cosmo's telekinesis. Rocket discovers imprisoned animals on the ship before being confronted by the High Evolutionary, who the other Guardians defeat. Rocket spares the High Evolutionary,[d] and the Guardians help the animals escape to Knowhere. Quill nearly dies trying to cross over, but is saved by Adam, who had a change of heart when Groot saved him from Ar\u00eate.\n\n\nIn the aftermath, Quill decides to leave the Guardians, naming Rocket as Captain, and travels to Earth to reunite with Jason, his grandfather. Mantis embarks on a journey of self-discovery with the Abilisks, Gamora reunites with the Ravagers, and Nebula and Drax remain on Knowhere to raise the rescued children.\n\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, the new Guardians, consisting of Rocket, Groot, Kraglin, Cosmo, Adam, Phyla (one of the rescued Star Children), and Adam's pet Blurp, take on a new mission. \n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n* Chris Pratt as Peter Quill / Star-Lord:  \nThe half-human, half-Celestial leader of the Guardians of the Galaxy who was abducted from Earth as a child and raised by a group of alien thieves and smugglers, the Ravagers.[6] In the film, Quill is in a \"state of depression\" following the appearance of a variant of his dead lover Gamora, who does not share the same affection for Quill as her older version had for him, which in turn affects his leadership of the Guardians.[7]\n* Zoe Salda\u00f1a as Gamora:  \nAn orphan who seeks redemption for her past crimes, and was adopted and trained by Thanos to be his personal assassin.[6] The original version of Gamora, a member of the Guardians, was killed by Thanos in *Avengers: Infinity War* (2018), and an alternate version of the character traveled to the present in *Avengers: Endgame* (2019); Salda\u00f1a reprises the latter role in this film,[8][9] now serving as a member of the Ravagers.[10] Salda\u00f1a stated that *Vol. 3* would be the final time she would portray Gamora, noting that she originally signed to play her in one film and ended up playing the role for much longer, a role she was grateful to play due to the impact it especially had on female fans.[11]\n* Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer:  \nA member of the Guardians and a highly skilled warrior whose family was slaughtered by Ronan the Accuser, under the instructions of Thanos.[6] Bautista stated that *Vol. 3* would be the final time he would portray Drax, having been grateful for the role, while still calling it a \"relief\" to have concluded his time with the character, given the long hours needed to get into makeup and hoping to pursue more dramatic acting roles.[12] Because of Bautista's decision, Gunn opted not to include Drax in the post-credits scene.[13]\n* Karen Gillan as Nebula:  \nA member of the Guardians, a former Avenger, and Gamora's adoptive sister who, similarly to her, was trained by their adoptive father Thanos to be his personal assassin.[14] Gillan believed Nebula was developing into a \"slightly different person\" with more levity as she starts to heal psychologically following the death of Thanos, who was the source of her abuse and torment.[15] *Vol. 3* fulfills a character arc for the character writer and director James Gunn envisioned when starting work on *Guardians of the Galaxy* (2014), going from a minor villain to a member of the Guardians.[16] Although the film teases a possible romance between Star-Lord and Nebula, Gunn denies having ever considered the two becoming a couple, though Gillan does believe she harbors a small crush on Quill.[13]\n* Pom Klementieff as Mantis: A member of the Guardians with empathic powers, and Quill's half-sister.[17]\n* Vin Diesel as the voice of Groot: A member of the Guardians who is a tree-like humanoid and the accomplice of Rocket.[6] Austin Freeman provided the motion-capture for Groot.\n* Bradley Cooper as Rocket:  \nA member of the Guardians and a former Avenger who is a genetically engineered raccoon-based bounty hunter and a master of weapons and military tactics.[6] Gunn said that the film tells Rocket's story, including his background and \"where he's going\", along with how that ties into the other Guardians and the end of this iteration of the team.[18] The film completes a character arc that was established in *Guardians of the Galaxy* and *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2* (2017), and continued in *Infinity War* and *Endgame*.[19] Sean Gunn once again provided on set motion capture for the character, while also voicing young Rocket.[20] Cooper also voiced adolescent Rocket while Noah Raskin voiced baby Rocket.[21]\n* Will Poulter as Adam Warlock:  \nA powerful artificial being created by the Sovereign to destroy the Guardians.[22] Given Warlock is newly born from the Sovereign's cocoon, he is \"basically a baby\" that \"does not understand life very well\".[23] Poulter believed there was \"a lot of comedy\" in someone just entering the world for the first time and \"trying to develop his moral compass\", while also having \"some genuine pathos\".[7] Gunn thought Warlock's interactions with the Guardians provided \"an interesting juxtaposition\" to what their journey has been, and described him as a more traditional superhero compared to the Guardians, although not necessarily a hero.[24]\n* Sean Gunn as Kraglin: A member of the Guardians and Yondu Udonta's former second-in-command in the Ravagers.[25]\n* Chukwudi Iwuji as the High Evolutionary:  \nAn alien cyborg scientist and CEO of OrgoCorp specializing in creating hybrid creatures and Rocket's creator, seeking to forcibly enhance all living beings into a \"special race\" where he has been credited as creating the Animen, the Humanimals, the Hell Spawn, the Sovereign, the Xeronians, and the Star Children.[7][26][27] Iwuji described the character as \"narcissistic, sociopathic, but very charming\", adding that there was \"something very Shakespearean about him, there's something very emotionally dark about him, and he's a lot of fun on top of all that\".[28] In preparation for the role, Iwuji listened to his character's taste for classical music in contrast to the American rock and pop music songs played in the film, allowing Iwuji to go back to his favorite arias and operas, like Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's *The Marriage of Figaro* (1786) and *Don Giovanni* (1787).[29] Gunn likened the High Evolutionary to \"a space version\" of Doctor Moreau from *Island of Lost Souls* (1932), a film Gunn is a big fan of, calling him \"a detestable character\".[7] When asked by Rachel Lindsay of *Extra* about the character, Gunn referred to the High Evolutionary as the \"cruelest MCU villain\" to date the franchise has ever seen due to how he negatively impacts on the lives of Rocket and his fellow subject friends,[30] while Iwuji made sure along with Gunn to avoid giving the Evolutionary, at least intentionally, any sympathy unlike previous villains like Thanos or Killmonger, focusing under Gunn's orders on commenting in the character's single mindedness, narcissistic and zealous personality like the \"most horrific\" figures in history have been shown to be.[31]\n* Linda Cardellini as Lylla: An anthropomorphic otter who is an associate and friend of Rocket.[32] Cardellini provided both the voice and motion capture for Lylla, having previously played Laura Barton in past MCU media.[33][34]\n* Nathan Fillion as Master Karja: An orgosentry at Orgocorp.[35][36]\n* Sylvester Stallone as Stakar Ogord: A high-ranking Ravager.[37]\n\n\nReprising their respective roles from previous *Guardians* films and/or *The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special* (2022) are Elizabeth Debicki as Ayesha, the golden High Priestess and the leader of the Sovereign people who had Adam Warlock created to destroy the Guardians;[38] Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex, a high-ranking Ravager;[39] Seth Green as the voice of Howard the Duck;[40] Christopher Fairbank as the Broker;[40] Stephen Blackehart and Rhett Miller as Steemie and Bzermikitokolok, two denizens of Knowhere;[41][42] Gregg Henry as Quill's grandfather Jason;[43] and Michael Rooker as Yondu Udonta, the former head of the Ravagers and Peter's deceased mentor.[40] Maria Bakalova reprises her voice and motion capture role from the *Holiday Special* as Cosmo,[44][45] a member of the Guardians who is a sapient dog that developed psionic abilities after being abandoned in outer space by the Soviet Union.[46] Gunn changed Cosmo's gender from male, as depicted in the comics, to female for the film, as a tribute to the character's original inspiration, Laika, a Soviet space dog who became one of the first animals in space.[47] Cosmo was physically portrayed by dog actor Slate,[45] after also doing so for the *Holiday Special*,[48] and was previously portrayed by dog actor Fred in the first two *Guardians* films.[49][50] Tara Strong (who voiced Miss Minutes in the Disney+ series *Loki*) voices Mainframe who was previously voiced by an uncredited Miley Cyrus in *Vol. 2*.[51][52] Jared Gore provides motion capture for Krugarr, a Ravager who wields sorcery powers and speaks through his sorcery.[53]\n\n\nAsim Chaudhry voices Teefs, an anthropomorphic walrus; Mikaela Hoover (who played Nova Prime's assistant in the first film) voices Floor, an anthropomorphic rabbit;[34] Daniela Melchior appears as Ura,[38][54] the receptionist at Orgocorp;[40] Miriam Shor and Nico Santos appear as Recorder Vim and Recorder Theel, respectively,[55] the scientifically-minded henchmen of the High Evolutionary;[56] Jennifer Holland appears as Administrator Kwol,[57] a security employee of Orgocorp;[40] Kai Zen appears as Phyla, one of the High Evolutionary's Star Child prisoners;[58] Judy Greer (who played Maggie Lang in the first two *Ant-Man* films) voices War Pig, a cyborg pig and member of the Hell Spawns working for the High Evolutionary;[59] Reinaldo Faberlle voices Behemoth, a cyborg bird and member of the Hell Spawns who also works for the High Evolutionary;[60] Dee Bradley Baker voices Blurp,[61] a furry F'saki that is an unnamed Ravager's pet;[62][63] and Dane DiLiegro appears as an Humanimal octopus drug dealer on Counter-Earth (credited as \"Unsavory Octopus\").[64]\n\n\nCameos in the film include Lloyd Kaufman as Gridlemop, a Krylorian on Knowhere who partakes in a card game with Kraglin; Pete Davidson as Phlektik, a guard at Ar\u00eate Laboratories;[65][66] and writer and director James Gunn as the voice of Lambshank, a deformed experiment of the High Evolutionary that is among those freed by the Guardians of the Galaxy.[67]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\n#### Initial work[edit]\n\n\n*Guardians of the Galaxy* (2014) writer and director James Gunn stated in November 2014 that, in addition to having the \"basic story\" for *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2* (2017) while working on the first film, he also had ideas for a potential third film.[68] Despite this, he was unsure in June 2015 if he would be involved with a third *Guardians* film, saying that it would depend on how he felt after making *Vol. 2*.[69] In April 2016, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige, the producer of the *Guardians* films, said a third film was planned for the franchise as part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) in \"2020 and beyond\".[70] In March 2017, Gunn said there would be a third film \"for sure. We're trying to figure it out\",[71] soon adding that there were no specific plans for the film yet, but that Marvel would want to make it \"unless something goes horribly\u2014which is always possible, you never know\".[72] He also reiterated that he had not decided whether he would be directing the film, and that he was going to figure out his involvement and his next project \"over the next couple of weeks\".[71] Part of Gunn's reluctance to return to the franchise came from not wanting to work on it without Michael Rooker, whose character from the first two films, Yondu Udonta, died at the end of *Vol. 2*.[73]\n\n\n\n> \n> \"In the end, my love for Rocket, Groot, Gamora, Star-Lord, Yondu, Mantis, Drax, and Nebula\u2014and some of the other forthcoming heroes\u2014goes deeper than you guys can possibly imagine, and I feel they have more adventures to go on and things to learn about themselves and the wonderful and sometimes terrifying universe we all inhabit.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014James Gunn, writer and director of *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3*, on his decision to return for the film[74]\n\nGunn announced in April 2017 that he would return to write and direct *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3*. He said the film would be set after *Avengers: Infinity War* (2018) and *Avengers: Endgame* (2019), and would \"conclude the story of this iteration of the Guardians of the Galaxy, and help catapult both old and new Marvel characters into the next ten years and beyond\".[74] He also felt that the three *Guardians* films would \"work together as a whole\", telling one story,[75] with the third film \"tying a lot of stuff together\" from the first two and giving \"a lot of answers on a lot of different things\".[76] Gunn also planned to work with Marvel on the future of the \"Marvel Cosmic Universe\".[74] He was set to begin work on *Vol. 3* shortly after completing his work as executive producer and consultant on *Infinity War*.[77] On returning for the third film, Gunn said, \"I wouldn't have said yes if I didn't have a fairly clear idea of where we were going and what we were going to do. I'm not a guy that's just going to do it if I don't have a vision for it\".[75]\n\n\nAfter originally including Adam Warlock in his script treatment for *Vol. 2*, Gunn and Feige noted the importance of the character on the cosmic side of the MCU and hinted that he would make an appearance in *Vol. 3*.[78] In May 2017, after the release of *Vol. 2*, Gunn said he would be creating the third film \"over the next three years\",[79] and confirmed that Pom Klementieff would reprise her role as Mantis.[17][80] He also intended to have Elizabeth Debicki reprise her role as Ayesha.[81] By mid-June, Gunn had completed the first draft of his script treatment for the third film, and was considering changing a piece of character info he had placed in the background of the mugshot sequence in the first film (when the Guardians are captured by the Nova Corps).[82] In September, Gunn reiterated that *Vol. 3* would be released \"in a little under three years\",[83] as the film had privately been set for release on May 1, 2020.[84] At the end of February 2018, Gunn planned to meet with Mark Hamill about possibly appearing in the film.[85] In April, Chris Pratt was set to reprise his role as Peter Quill / Star-Lord,[17][86] and the following month, Dave Bautista confirmed that he would reprise his role as Drax the Destroyer.[87] Marvel received the completed first draft of the screenplay from Gunn by the end of June, ahead of the beginning of official pre-production on the film.[88]\n\n\n\n#### Firing of James Gunn[edit]\n\n\nOn July 20, 2018, Disney and Marvel severed ties with Gunn. This came after conservative commentators, such as Mike Cernovich, began circulating old tweets he had made regarding controversial topics such as rape and pedophilia, and called for his firing.[89][90] The Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan F. Horn stated, \"The offensive attitudes and statements discovered on James' Twitter feed are indefensible and inconsistent with our studio's values, and we have severed our business relationship with him\".[89] While not part of the decision to fire Gunn, the Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger supported the \"unanimous decision\" from the various executives at Marvel and Walt Disney Studios.[91] In response, Gunn said in a series of tweets that when he started his career he was \"making movies and telling jokes that were outrageous and taboo\" but felt as he has \"developed as a person, so has my work and my humor\". He continued, \"It's not to say I'm better, but I am very, very different than I was a few years ago; today I try to root my work in love and connection and less in anger. My days saying something just because it's shocking and trying to get a reaction are over\". In a separate statement, Gunn said the tweets at the time were \"totally failed and unfortunate efforts to be provocative\", adding \"I understand and accept the business decisions taken today. Even these many years later, I take full responsibility for the way I conducted myself then\".[89]\n\n\n\n![](image)James Gunn, writer and director of *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3*\nIn response to the firing, many of the *Guardians* cast members tweeted support for Gunn. Rooker decided to leave Twitter,[92][93] while fans signed an online petition asking for Gunn to be reinstated which received over 300,000 signatures.[94] The firing also garnered reaction from other Hollywood personalities, such as actress Selma Blair and comedian Bobcat Goldthwait,[93] and inspired opinion pieces on the firing and how it would affect Hollywood from Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,[95] and news organizations such as *The Hollywood Reporter*,[96] *Variety*,[97] *Deadline Hollywood*,[98] and *Forbes*.[99] On July 30, the cast of the *Guardians of the Galaxy* films, including Pratt, Zoe Salda\u00f1a, Bautista, Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel, Sean Gunn, Klementieff, Rooker, and Karen Gillan, issued a statement in support of James Gunn, saying, \"We fully support James Gunn. We were all shocked by his abrupt firing last week and have intentionally waited these ten days to respond in order to think, pray, listen, and discuss. In that time, we've been encouraged by the outpouring of support from fans and members of the media who wish to see James reinstated as director of *Volume 3* as well as discouraged by those so easily duped into believing the many outlandish conspiracy theories surrounding him\".[94] Despite this and the notable \"vociferous support\" Gunn received, *Variety* reported that Disney was not planning to rehire him as the jokes were \"unacceptable in the #MeToo era and are not in line with Disney's family-friendly image\". *Variety* continued that, despite rumors of Gunn being replaced by established Marvel directors such as Jon Favreau, Taika Waititi, or the Russo brothers, Marvel had yet to meet with any other director, and would most likely hire someone new.[100] In early August, Bautista said that he would fulfill his contract and appear in the film as long as Marvel chose to use Gunn's existing script.[101]\n\n\nDisney and Marvel still wanted to \"move forward quickly\" on the film,[102] and were soon confirmed to be keeping Gunn's script. This, combined with the fact that Gunn did not breach his contract since the tweets were written years before he signed on to the film, had led to \"complicated negotiations\" between Gunn and Disney over his exit settlement. Gunn was expected to be paid $7\u201310\u00a0million or more, and there was some hope that the negotiations could lead to him eventually returning in some capacity, \"even if [it was] to develop and direct another Marvel movie\". Gunn would be free to move on to new projects following the settlement, and other major studios were interested in hiring him including Warner Bros. for their rival superhero franchise, the DC Extended Universe (DCEU).[103] During this time, executives at Marvel Studios began \"back channel conversations\" with Disney in an attempt to find a compromise that could lead to Gunn returning to the film in some way. This \"eleventh-hour\" effort from Marvel was inspired by the statements from the film's cast.[102] In mid-August, Gunn met with Horn following a strong push from Gunn's talent agency for him to be given a second chance. Despite this and the reported \"civil and professional\" nature of the meeting, Horn only took it as a courtesy and used it to reaffirm Disney's decision to fire Gunn.[104]\n\n\nLater in August, the small crew that was preparing for pre-production were dismissed as production of the film was postponed so Marvel and Disney could find a director to replace Gunn.[105] Pre-production was to have begun by the end of 2018, with principal photography set for January or February 2019.[105][106] At this time, Bautista was unsure if he would return for the film, as he did not know if he would \"want to work for Disney\" given how they handled the firing of Gunn.[107] In late September, James Gunn's brother Sean, who played Kraglin Obfonteri and provided motion capture for Rocket in the previous *Guardians* films, reiterated that Disney still intended on making the film with James's script, but had not revealed to the cast when production may continue. Sean added that he had been preparing to reprise his roles for the third film before his brother's firing.[25] At the end of the month, Cooper was asked if he would consider directing *Vol. 3* after the success of his directorial debut *A Star Is Born* (2018), but said that he \"could never imagine\" directing a film that he did not write.[108] By mid-October, James Gunn had completed his exit settlement with Disney and was set to write and potentially direct *The Suicide Squad* (2021) for Warner Bros / DC Films.[109]\n\n\n\n#### Rehiring Gunn[edit]\n\n\nThe day after Gunn joined *The Suicide Squad* in mid-October 2018, he was privately notified by Horn that he could return as director for *Vol. 3*. This came after further meetings between the studios and Gunn. Horn had changed his mind after being impressed by Gunn's response to the situation.[110][111] Gunn discussed his commitments to *The Suicide Squad* with Feige,[110] and production on *Vol. 3* was put on hold until February 2021 to allow Gunn to complete *The Suicide Squad* first.[111][112][113] In December, after working with Marvel Studios on the script for *Ant-Man* (2015), Adam McKay said he was willing to work with the studio again and stated that he had discussed taking over as director for *Vol. 3* with Feige, among other projects.[114] In early 2019, Feige and Pratt reiterated that Marvel would still make *Vol. 3*,[115][116] and in March 2019, Gunn was publicly revealed to have been rehired as director of the film. *Deadline Hollywood* stated that Marvel Studios had \"never met with or considered any other director\" for the film.[111] By the end of April, the franchise's five main stars\u2014Pratt, Salda\u00f1a, Bautista, Cooper, and Diesel\u2014were all expected to return for the sequel, with filming to take place in 2020.[6]\n\n\nDiscussing his firing and re-hiring in May 2019, Gunn said that of all the elements of the film that he had been sad to leave when he was fired, the most meaningful to him was the character of Rocket. Gunn personally identifies with Rocket, describing himself and the character as \"the same\".[19] He had actually grown to love the character since working on the first film due to feeling that an origin story for Rocket could justify what a Bugs Bunny-like \"goofy character\" like him could exist in the MCU if it were the saddest one in the universe, crediting it as the \"seed\" of the trilogy. While *Vol. 3* effectively reveals Rocket's backstory through flashbacks akin to those from the story structure of *The Godfather Part II* (1974), Gunn initially considered to tell Rocket's origins in a team-up movie between him and Groot without the other Guardians, but ultimately felt that he had to conclude Peter Quill's story first and then focus on Rocket in a third Guardians-centric film.[117] That month, Gillan confirmed that she was returning for the sequel and expressed excitement for Gunn's return to the franchise.[14] In June, Salda\u00f1a was asked about her role in the film after her character Gamora was killed in *Infinity War*, and she returned to play a younger version in *Endgame* who travels through time to the present. Salda\u00f1a said that Gamora's fate would depend on the plans that Marvel and Gunn have for *Vol. 3*, but that she would like to see Gamora rejoin the Guardians and also be portrayed as \"the most lethal woman in the galaxy\" as she has been referred to previously.[8] Gunn was asked in October if he was unhappy about Marvel's decision to kill Gamora in *Infinity War* and said he was not, adding that he had discussed the storyline with the studio beforehand.[118] According to *Infinity War* and *Endgame* screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, Gamora was brought back in *Endgame* specifically so that Gunn could include her in *Vol. 3*,[9] so Gunn found no complications over writing her character arc in *Vol. 3* due to having been told in advance.[119] In December, Gunn was asked if he would have Yondu return in the film and said as long as he was involved with the *Guardians* characters, he would not have the character be resurrected. Gunn felt the stakes of a character's death were important and said characters who die in his films would likely remain dead.[120] Gunn said in February 2020 that bringing Yondu back to life would \"nullify Yondu's sacrifice\" in *Vol. 2*, and said the character would not return unless it was for a prequel or flashback;[121] Gunn later said Yondu would not be resurrected in the film to not diminish his death's meaning.[122] In April, Gunn said the COVID-19 pandemic would not affect production plans for the film at that time,[123] saying the next month that the film would be released \"a little after 2021\".[84]\n\n\nIn August 2020, Gunn turned in a new draft of the film's script and began writing a spin-off television series from *The Suicide Squad* titled *Peacemaker* (2022).[124] A month later, he was planning to begin work on *Vol. 3* in 2021 after completing that film and series.[125] He confirmed in November that the script for *Vol. 3* was finished,[126] and said that very little had changed from his initial ideas despite the production setbacks.[127] The film was given a 2023 release date a month later,[128] with filming set to begin in late 2021.[127][129] Shortly after, it was revealed to also be set after *The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special* (2022).[130]\n\n\n\n### Pre-production[edit]\n\n\nPre-production work creating the designs and visuals for the film began by April 2021.[131] In early May, Marvel Studios announced that the film would be released on May 5, 2023.[132] Later that month, Gunn said *Vol. 3* would take place after the events of *Thor: Love and Thunder* (2022), which features several *Guardians* characters.[133] That film concludes the storyline established in *Endgame* which sees Thor journey off with the Guardians. Gunn noted this ending was decided upon \"in editing\" and conflicted with his already-submitted screenplay for *Vol. 3*, since he never planned to feature Thor in the film.[134] Gunn had begun storyboarding the film by June,[135] with filming later revealed to begin in November 2021 in Atlanta, Georgia for an expected end around April 2022.[136][137][138] By then, Bautista said he had not read a script for *Vol. 3* and was unsure if it had changed during the production delays.[136] The next month, Gillan said that she and Klementieff had read the script together and she found it to be incredible, brilliant, emotional and funny. She also felt it was Gunn's \"strongest work yet\" with the Guardians characters.[139] Gunn reiterated that the script had \"basically stayed the same\" from three years prior but he had been \"playing with it in little ways\" over the years. He was in the middle of another draft by the end of the month and said the film would be emotional and have a \"heavier\" story than the previous films,[138][140] with a more grounded approach that was inspired by *The Suicide Squad* and *Peacemaker*.[141] An early option Gunn had in mind for the character who would become the film's main villain and be revealed to be the one who created Rocket was the Fantastic Four villain Annihilus, but Gunn ultimately opted to fill that role with the High Evolutionary.[142] Gunn originally wrote a cameo appearance for Kumail Nanjiani, a friend of his, but removed this after learning Nanjiani was cast as Kingo in Marvel Studios' *Eternals* (2021).[143]\n\n\nBy late August, Gunn and Marvel Studios began meeting with actors for the role of Adam Warlock, including Will Poulter. George MacKay was also on the shortlist and Reg\u00e9-Jean Page was considered for the part.[22][144] Poulter auditioned for the role over Zoom before an in-person screen test with Gunn in Atlanta.[145] When first auditioning for Warlock, Poulter was unaware of who his character's name was other than he had been teased at the post-credits scene of *Vol. 2*, but Marvel just described the role to him as \"an untitled character\" until Poulter was \"drip-fed\" with more information over and over until discovering how steeped Adam Warlock is in the source material.[146] In September, Gillan reiterated her positive comments about the script and said the film would explore the characters from the previous *Guardians* films on a deeper level,[147] while Seth Green, who voices Howard the Duck in the MCU, said the film would be about Gamora and Nebula's story. He did not know at that time if Howard would appear after doing so in the previous *Guardians* films.[148] Poulter was cast as Adam Warlock in October,[22][144] and Gunn said \"dozens of roles\" had already been cast.[149] Poulter was chosen for the part because of his dramatic and comedic abilities and because Gunn \"wanted somebody who was youthful\" and would fit with Marvel Studios' future plans for the character.[23] Casting also took place for various background roles, including aliens and security guards.[150][151] Pratt began rehearsals and camera tests later that month,[152] and a production meeting was held in early November, shortly before the start of filming. Gunn also reiterated his comments on not resurrecting Yondu in the film.[153]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\nPrincipal photography began on November 8, 2021,[154] at Trilith Studios in Atlanta, Georgia,[151][155] under the working title *Hot Christmas*.[113] Henry Braham serves as cinematographer, after doing so for *Vol. 2*, *The Suicide Squad*, and *The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special*.[156] Filming was previously scheduled to begin in January or February 2019 prior to Gunn's firing,[105][106] and then in February 2021,[113] before Gunn began work on *Peacemaker*.[125] With the start of filming, Sylvester Stallone revealed that he would return as Stakar Ogord from *Vol. 2*,[37] and Gunn posted a photo of the main cast members which revealed that Chukwudi Iwuji was part of the film following his collaboration with Gunn on *Peacemaker*.[154][157] Iwuji's screen test for the film was shot on the set of *Peacemaker* with that series' crew, and Marvel repaid this favor by letting Gunn use the *Vol. 3* set and crew to film Ezra Miller's cameo appearance as Barry Allen / The Flash for the *Peacemaker* season finale.[141]\n\n\nProduction designer Beth Mickle said Gunn chose to mainly use practical effects for *Vol. 3* after they did so with their work on *The Suicide Squad*.[158] In February 2021, Gunn stated the film would be shot using Industrial Light & Magic's StageCraft virtual production technology that was developed for the Disney+ *Star Wars* series *The Mandalorian*,[159] but in October, he said they would not be able to use the technology because the sets were too big,[160] believing they were larger than the sets used on *The Suicide Squad*.[161] The interior of the Guardians' new ship, the *Bowie*, was a four-story set.[162] Judianna Makovsky serves as costume designer.[163] *The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special* was filmed at the same time as *Vol. 3*,[16][164] from February to late April 2022,[165][166] with the same main cast and sets.[130][140][162] Gunn enjoyed being able to switch to filming the special after doing scenes for *Vol. 3*, given the tonal difference between the two with *Vol. 3* being more \"emotional\",[167] feeling it helped provide a \"relief\" to the actors as well,[16] and called the *Holiday Special* shoot easier than *Vol. 3*.[162] In February 2022, Callie Brand was revealed to appear in the film as an alien.[63] Shooting was also expected to occur in London, England, in late 2021.[168] *Vol. 3* is the first MCU film to feature the word \"fuck\" uncensored; it is spoken by Quill. The dialogue \"Open the fucking door\" was not scripted, but improvised by Pratt on Gunn's suggestion,[169][170][171] though there was some consideration over giving the one-liner to Groot instead.[172] Gunn mentioned that the Korean film *The Villainess* (2017) inspired one of the fight scenes in *Vol. 3*.[173][174][175] Filming on *Vol. 3* wrapped on May 6, 2022.[176]\n\n\n\n### Post-production[edit]\n\n\nIn early June 2022, Daniela Melchior was revealed to have a small role in the film, after previously starring in *The Suicide Squad*. Debicki was also confirmed to be reprising her role as Ayesha,[38] while Maria Bakalova and Nico Santos were also revealed to be appearing in the film.[177][178] In July, Iwuji and Bakalova were revealed to be portraying the High Evolutionary and Cosmo the Spacedog, respectively.[46] Cosmo was physically portrayed by dog actor Fred in the first two *Guardians* films,[49][50] and Slate in the *Holiday Special* and *Vol. 3*.[45][48] The following month, Michael Rosenbaum revealed that he had reprised his role as Martinex from *Vol. 2* in the film.[39] In October 2022, it was revealed that Bakalova would portray Cosmo in the *Holiday Special* ahead of her role in *Vol. 3*.[179] In February 2023, Asim Chaudhry revealed he would appear in the film in an undisclosed role.[180] In April 2023, Linda Cardellini was revealed to be voicing Lylla; she previously appeared in multiple MCU projects as Laura Barton, and starred as Velma Dinkley in the Gunn-written films *Scooby-Doo* (2002) and *Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed* (2004), as well as a cameo in the Gunn-written and directed *Super* (2010).[34] Two days of reshoots occurred.[20] In late April, Tara Strong revealed that she was cast in an undisclosed role.[51] Strong was later revealed to have been cast as Mainframe, replacing Miley Cyrus from *Vol. 2* due to Cyrus' unavailability.[181]\n\n\nThe visual effects were provided by Framestore, Weta FX, Sony Pictures Imageworks, Industrial Light & Magic, Rodeo FX, Rise FX, Crafty Apes, BUF, Lola VFX, Perception, and Compuhire.[182] Stephane Ceretti returns from the first film to serve as the visual effects supervisor,[183] while Fred Raskin returns from the first two films to serve as the editor,[184] alongside Greg D'Auria, who returns from the *Holiday Special*.[185] Additional editing was provided by Tatiana S. Riegel.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3* (soundtrack)\n\nIn April 2017, Gunn felt the music for the film would be different from what was used for the first two films' soundtracks, *Awesome Mix Vol. 1* and *Vol. 2*.[75] The next month, he added that he was \"panicking\" about the soundtrack and had to make some \"pretty specific choices\" shortly due to the wider range of available music for the story,[186] By early July 2017, Gunn had narrowed down his choices for potential songs to 181, but noted that this list could grow again.[187] All of the songs for the film had been selected by the following month;[188] the songs are not modern and come from Quill's Zune that he received at the end of *Vol. 2*,[189] although Gunn added that the soundtrack was not limited to 1970s pop songs compared to the first two films,[24] instead spanning multiple decades.[134] Gunn was unable to use the song \"Russian Roulette\" by the Lords of the New Church for *Vol. 3* due to a legal battle over its ownership.[190][191] The film opens with an acoustic version of \"Creep\" by Radiohead, which provided \"a much different tone from the beginning than the other two films\".[134] The film ends with \"Dog Days Are Over\" by Florence and the Machine, as Gunn is a fan of its album *Lungs*; he had thought about including the song to wrap-up the trilogy since he started writing *Vol. 2*.[13]\n\n\nThe track list for *Awesome Mix Vol. 3* was revealed in April 2023,[192] and was made available on Spotify and Apple Music on April 3 as part of a larger *Guardians of the Galaxy: The Official Mixtape* playlist, which also featured the soundtracks and scores from the previous two films.[192][193] *Awesome Mix Vol. 3* was released by Hollywood Records on CD and digital download on May 3, 2023, a 12\" 2-LP vinyl on May 5, and is set to release on cassette on July 7.[194]\n\n\nIn October 2021, Gunn revealed that John Murphy was composing the film's score and had already recorded music to be played on set during filming.[195][196] Murphy replaces Tyler Bates, who composed the score for the first two films. However, Bates' theme from the previous films were referenced; Murphy had also replaced Bates as composer of *The Suicide Squad* after Bates left that film during production.[197] Murphy's original score for the film was released digitally on May 3, 2023.[194]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nThe film was discussed during Marvel Studios' panel at the 2022 San Diego Comic-Con, where the first footage was revealed. Iwuji was also announced as playing the High Evolutionary, appearing at the panel in costume.[46] Gunn stated the footage was not released publicly because the visual effects were not complete enough for \"repeated views and close inspection\".[198] An official trailer was released on December 1, 2022, during the CCXP.[27] It featured \"In the Meantime\" by Spacehog. Drew Taylor of *TheWrap* called the trailer a doozy, thrilling, and emotional, and stated that \"Gunn's patented, rollicking 'Guardians of the Galaxy' tone is very much in place\", and noted \"an undercurrent of extreme melancholy\".[199] Carson Burton of *Variety* predicted from the trailer that the film would be \"shaping up to be an emotional ending\" by showing Rocket's memories and Star-Lord missing Gamora.[27] Jay Peters at *The Verge* said the trailer intrigued him as a \"wild ride across the stars\" with different planets.[200]\n\n\nA second trailer for the film was released during Super Bowl LVII on February 12, 2023. It featured \"Since You Been Gone\" by Rainbow.[201] Grant Hermanns of *Screen Rant* felt the trailer gave \"a deeper look\" at the film, particularly Adam Warlock's powers as compared to his brief appearance in the first one. Hermanns also said the second trailer \"goes a step further in highlighting the emotional story\" after the first one \"efficiently set [the film's] tone, featuring plenty of melancholic shots of the [Guardians of the Galaxy] facing the music\".[202] The trailer accumulated 134.1\u00a0million views across TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook, and was the most-watched Super Bowl trailer in post-game day traffic according to RelishMix. It was also the first time since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic that a Super Bowl trailer exceeded 100 million views on social media in a 24-hour period.[203]\n\n\nDisney and Marvel Music partnered with the music streaming service Spotify in May 2023, to promote the film. As part of the promotion, a playlist, titled the \"K-GOTG Radio Experience\", was created.[204] Marvel Studios also promoted the film with General Mills limited-edition cereals and snacks, including Honey Nut Cheerios, Cookie Crisp, Lucky Charms, Trix, Reese's Puffs, Cinnamon Toast Crunch, and Go-Gurt.[205] Microsoft also partnered with Marvel Studios to promote the film with a limited-edition Zune MP3 player; a single non-functional model would be created using 3D printing and launched inside the International Space Station.[206]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\n*Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3* had an early screening at Dongdaemun Design Plaza on April 19, 2023.[207] The film premiered at Disneyland Paris on April 22, 2023,[208][209] and its North American premiere was held at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on April 27.[210] The film was released in several countries including the United Kingdom on May 3, 2023, and in the United States on May 5.[211][212][213][214] It was previously set for release on May 1, 2020,[84] before it was dropped from that date.[215] It is part of Phase Five of the MCU.[46] It was released in 3D, IMAX, Dolby Cinema, 4DX, and ScreenX.[216]\n\n\nDisney released over 600 unique versions of the film to theaters, including a version with variable aspect ratios. Forty-five minutes of the film was presented in the flat 1.85:1 aspect ratio, while the rest of the film is in the 2.39:1 letterboxed aspect ratio.[217]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3* was released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on digital download on July 7, 2023; on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on August 1;[218] and on Disney+ on August 2,[219] where an IMAX Enhanced version was also available.[220] The film was the final physical media release for Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment in Australia, as they decided to discontinue selling their films on physical home media there.[221]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n*Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3* has grossed $359\u00a0million in the United States and Canada, and $486.6\u00a0million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $845.6\u00a0million.[3][4]\n\n\nIn the US and Canada, *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3* was projected to gross around $110\u00a0million from 4,450 theaters in its opening weekend.[207] The film made $48.2\u00a0million on its first day,[222] including $17.5\u00a0million from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut with $118.4\u00a0million, topping the box office.[223] In its second weekend, *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3* retained the top spot at the box office with $62\u00a0million,[224][225][226] a 48% decline from its opening weekend and the best second-weekend hold of any sequel in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and a notably smaller second-weekend decline than those of the franchise's recent releases, including *Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania* (70%), *Thor: Love and Thunder* (68%), and *Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness* (67%).[226][227] The film made $32 million in its third weekend, being dethroned by *Fast X*.[228]\n\n\nOutside the US and Canada, the film grossed $168.1 million in its opening weekend.[229] In its second weekend, the film grossed $92 million for a drop of 40% from its opening weekend. As of May 27, 2023, the highest grossing territories were China ($77.4 million), the United Kingdom ($36 million), Mexico ($30.8 million), South Korea ($26.7 million), and France ($24.3 million).[230]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 82% based on 401 reviews with an average rating of 7.2/10. The site's critics consensus reads: \"A galactic group hug that might squeeze a little too tight on the heartstrings, the final *Guardians of the Galaxy* is a loving last hurrah for the MCU's most ragtag family.\"[231] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 64 out of 100, based on 63 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[232] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, the same as the previous two *Guardians* films, while PostTrak reported that moviegoers gave the film a 91% positive score, with 79% saying they would definitely recommend it.[223]\n\n\n*The Independent* found it was \"the best Marvel movie in years\"[233] as did *Vox*[234] and the CBC.[235] In mixed reviews, Peter Bradshaw of *The Guardian*[236] and Nicholas Barber of the BBC agreed the film was overlong, Barber opining that \"the film's saving grace is that, just as Gunn has been allowed to unleash his gonzo imagination, he has also been allowed to pour out his emotions.\"[237] Wendy Ide of *The Observer* lauded the films for its emotional weight and deemed it a satisfying conclusion, stating that \"What elevates Vol 3 (supposedly the final film in the *GOTG* series) is the way it keeps that personality, nodding to the irreverent swagger that is a crucial component of the *Guardians* USP while delivering a series of devastating emotional sucker punches along the way.\"[238] Matt Singer from *ScreenCrush* praised the film for concluding Rocket's arc story stating that \"a character tells Rocket that the events unfolding onscreen have been *his* story all along \u2014 and with *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3*, it does feel like Marvel has spent $200 million on a movie about a melancholy space raccoon looking for love and acceptance.\"[239] Writing for *The Verge,* Charles Pulliam-Moore praised the film's action sequences and storyline and commented that \"*Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3* tells the action-packed, flashback-filled story of how Rocket Raccoon's (Bradley Cooper) life being gravely endangered gives the rest of the Guardians a reason to come together and really start working on some of the emotional issues that've been haunting them since *Endgame*.\"[240] *The Hindustan Times* praised Gunn's direction and writing, commenting that \"As James Gunn concludes his journey with these characters he clearly cares so deeply about, you can't help but reflect on your own. Walking out, I had my own little flashback montage playing in my head of all the adventures we've been on and foes we've faced with this lovable group of galaxy-saving idiots.\"[241] Nathan Durr of CBS News praised the film's soundtrack and stated that \"There's no exception here regarding the soundtrack as Gunn and company cleverly implement songs that add weight to the complexities and emotions of the characters.\"[242]\n\n\nA negative review from NPR criticized the approach of cruelty to animals in the film[243] while *The New York Times* called it a \"dour, visually off-putting two-and-a-half-hour A.S.P.C.A. nightmare of a film (that) may only be for completionist fans\",[244] and the *Chicago Tribune*, \"the most empty, brutal MCU movie yet\".[245] Conversely, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) declared the film to be \"the best animal rights film of the year\", and gave Gunn a \"Not a Number Award\" for his depiction of animal testing.[246]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nCynthia Blondelle and Heather Kreamer were nominated at the 2023 Guild of Music Supervisors Awards for Best Music Supervision in a Trailer \u2013 Film.[247] *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3* received nominations for Best Fantasy Adventure, Best Summer 2023 Blockbuster Trailer, and Best Teaser at the 2023 Golden Trailer Awards.[248][249] The film was nominated for Best Picture at the 6th Hollywood Critics Association Midseason Film Awards.[250] The *Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 3: Awesome Mix, Vol. 3* soundtrack is nominated for Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media at the 66th Grammy Awards.[251]\n\n\n\n## Documentary special[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Marvel Studios: Assembled*\n\nIn February 2021, the documentary series *Marvel Studios: Assembled* was announced.[252] The special on this film, *Assembled: The Making of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3*, was released on Disney+ on September 13, 2023.[253]\n\n\n\n## Future[edit]\n\n\nGunn said in April 2017 that a fourth *Guardians* film could happen, though it would likely center on a new group of characters since Gunn planned to conclude the story of the current team in *Vol. 3*.[254] Later in September, Gunn said he was unlikely to return for another *Guardians* film but would continue to work with Marvel Studios on other projects that use the Guardians and cosmic characters.[255] One such project from Gunn was a film centered on Drax and Mantis, which Bautista called \"brilliant\". However, in May 2021, Bautista stated that he had not heard any further updates regarding it, feeling Marvel Studios was not \"very interested, or it doesn't fit into the way they have things mapped out\".[256] Gunn confirmed in September 2019 that he intended for *Vol. 3* to be his last *Guardians* film,[257] which he reaffirmed in May 2021.[258] In July 2021, Gillan expressed her desire to continue playing Nebula after *Vol. 3*.[259] In April 2023, Salda\u00f1a confirmed that *Vol. 3* would be the last time she portrays Gamora, but hoped Marvel would recast the role with a younger actor because she wished for the character to continue.[11] The following month, Pratt indicated his willingness to continue playing Peter Quill in the future if the right script came along,[260] and a note at the end of *Vol. 3*'s post-credits scene states that the \"Legendary Star-Lord\" would return to the MCU.[43]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** As established in *The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special* (2022)\n2. **^** As depicted in *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2* (2017)\n3. **^** Introduced through time travel in *Avengers: Endgame* (2019)\n4. **^** Director James Gunn confirmed on Twitter that the film shows the High Evolutionary being rescued by Drax during the evacuation of the ship, with the High Evolutionary being imprisoned on Knowhere off-screen afterwards.[5]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"*Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3* (12A)\". *BBFC*.

Robert Oppenheimer, the American theoretical physicist credited with being the \"father of the atomic bomb\" for his role in the Manhattan Project\u2014the World War II undertaking that developed the first nuclear weapons. Based on the 2005 biography *American Prometheus* by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, the film chronicles the career of Oppenheimer, with the story predominantly focusing on his studies, his direction of the Manhattan Project during World War II, and his eventual fall from grace due to his 1954 security hearing. The film also stars Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer's wife \"Kitty\", Matt Damon as head of the Manhattan Project Leslie Groves, Robert Downey Jr. as U.S. Atomic Energy Commission member Lewis Strauss, and Florence Pugh as Oppenheimer's communist lover Jean Tatlock. The ensemble supporting cast includes Josh Hartnett, Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, and Kenneth Branagh.\n\n\nThe film was announced in September 2021 after Universal Pictures won a bidding war for Nolan's screenplay, following Nolan's conflict with longtime distributor Warner Bros. Murphy was the first cast member to sign on the following month, with the rest of the cast joining between November 2021 and April 2022. Pre-production was under way by January 2022, and filming took place from February to May. *Oppenheimer* was filmed in a combination of IMAX 65\u00a0mm and 65 mm large-format film, including, for the first time, scenes in IMAX black-and-white film photography. Like his previous works, Nolan made extensive use of practical effects, with minimal computer-generated imagery used to perfect the former. Editing was handled by Jennifer Lame, and the score was composed by Ludwig G\u00f6ransson. The film is Nolan's fourth to receive an R-rating in the United States, preceded by *Following* (1998), *Memento* (2000) and *Insomnia* (2002).\n\n\n*Oppenheimer* premiered at Le Grand Rex in Paris on July 11, 2023, and was theatrically released in the United States and the United Kingdom on July 21 by Universal. Its simultaneous release with Warner Bros.'s *Barbie* led to the Barbenheimer cultural phenomenon, which encouraged audiences to see both films as a double feature. The film received critical acclaim and grossed over $950 million worldwide, becoming the third-highest-grossing film of 2023, the highest-grossing World War II-related film, the highest-grossing biographical film, and the second-highest-grossing R-rated film.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn 1926, 22-year-old doctoral student J. Robert Oppenheimer grapples with anxiety and homesickness while studying under experimental physicist Patrick Blackett at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge. Upset with the demanding Blackett, Oppenheimer leaves him a poisoned apple but later retrieves it. Visiting scientist Niels Bohr recommends that Oppenheimer instead study theoretical physics at G\u00f6ttingen. \n\n\nHe completes his PhD there and meets fellow scientist Isidor Isaac Rabi. They later meet theoretical physicist Werner Heisenberg in Switzerland. Wanting to expand quantum physics research in the United States, Oppenheimer begins teaching at the University of California, Berkeley, and the California Institute of Technology. He marries Katherine \"Kitty\" Puening, a biologist and ex-communist, and has an intermittent affair with Jean Tatlock, a troubled Communist Party USA member who later commits suicide.\n\n\nIn December 1938, nuclear fission is discovered, which Oppenheimer realizes could be weaponized. In 1942, during World War II, U.S. Army General Leslie Groves recruits Oppenheimer to lead the Manhattan Project to develop an atomic bomb. Oppenheimer, who is Jewish, is particularly driven by the Nazis' potentially completing their nuclear weapons program, headed by Heisenberg. \n\n\nHe assembles a scientific team including Rabi and Edward Teller in Los Alamos, New Mexico, and also collaborates with scientists Enrico Fermi, Leo Szilard and David L. Hill at the University of Chicago. Teller's calculations reveal an atomic detonation could possibly trigger a catastrophic chain reaction that ignites the atmosphere. After consulting with Albert Einstein, Oppenheimer concludes the chances are acceptably low. Teller's proposal to construct a hydrogen bomb is swiftly rejected. He attempts to leave the project, though Oppenheimer convinces him to stay.\n\n\nFollowing Adolf Hitler's death in 1945, some Project scientists question the bomb's relevance, while Oppenheimer believes it will end the ongoing war in the Pacific and save Allied lives. The Trinity test is successful, and President Harry S. Truman orders Hiroshima and Nagasaki to be bombed, forcing Japan's surrender. Though publicly praised, Oppenheimer is haunted by the mass destruction and fatalities, and urges restricting further nuclear weapons development, which Truman curtly dismisses. \n\n\nAs an advisor to the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), Oppenheimer's stance generates controversy, while Teller's hydrogen bomb receives renewed interest amidst the burgeoning Cold War. AEC Chairman Lewis Strauss resents Oppenheimer for having publicly humiliated him by dismissing his concerns about exporting radioisotopes, and for recommending negotiations with the Soviet Union after they successfully detonated their own bomb. He also believes that Oppenheimer denigrated him during a conversation Oppenheimer had with Einstein in 1947.\n\n\nIn 1954, wanting to eliminate Oppenheimer's political influence, Strauss secretly orchestrates a private hearing before a Personnel Security Board concerning Oppenheimer's Q clearance. However, it becomes clear that the hearing has a predetermined outcome. Oppenheimer's past communist ties are exploited, and Groves' and other associates' testimony is twisted against him. \n\n\nTeller testifies that he lacks confidence in Oppenheimer and recommends revocation. The board revokes Oppenheimer's clearance, damaging his public image and limiting his influence on nuclear policy. In 1959, during Strauss' Senate confirmation hearing for Secretary of Commerce, Hill testifies about Strauss' personal motives in engineering Oppenheimer's downfall, resulting in the Senate voting against his nomination.\n\n\nIn 1963, President Lyndon B. Johnson presents Oppenheimer with the Enrico Fermi Award as a gesture of political rehabilitation. A flashback reveals that Oppenheimer and Einstein's 1947 conversation never mentioned Strauss. Oppenheimer instead expressed his somber belief that he had started a chain reaction that might destroy the world.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n![Actor Cillian Murphy at a press conference for The Party at the 67th Berlin International Film Festival in 2017](image)\n![Portrait of J.

After that project failed to materialize, and the book was optioned by various filmmakers over the fifteen years following, the authors grew pessimistic about seeing their work adapted to the screen. At one point Oliver Stone was offered the opportunity to direct, but turned it down because he \"couldn't find my way to its essence\".[51] In 2015, J. David Wargo optioned the book, then commissioned and rejected several scripts. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Wargo flew to Hollywood to meet with actor James Woods, who set up a meeting with Charles Roven, a producer for various Christopher Nolan films, and in turn, Roven gave a copy of the book to Nolan. Both Wargo and Woods are executive producers of the film.[52]\n\n\nNolan had long desired to make a film about Oppenheimer, even prior to reading *American Prometheus*.[53] In 2019, towards the end of production on Nolan's science-fiction film *Tenet* (2020), star Robert Pattinson gave the director a book of Oppenheimer's speeches. According to Nolan, the speeches showed the physicist \"wrestling with the implications ... of what's happened and what [he's] done\". Nolan wanted to depict \"what it would have been like to be Oppenheimer in those moments\" in contrast to *Tenet*, which employs time travel to curb a potential weapon of mass destruction.[54][2]\n\n\nIn December 2020, Warner Bros. Pictures announced plans to give its 2021 films simultaneous releases in theaters and on HBO Max, citing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the film industry. Nolan, who had partnered with the studio on each one of his films starting with *Insomnia* (2002), was outraged with the decision as he had been a proponent of film theaters.[55] In January 2021, media reports mentioned the possibility that Nolan's next film could be the first not to be financed or distributed by Warner Bros.[56] By mid-2021, the filmmaker had left Warner Bros. and was meeting with other studios to develop his new project.[2] Nolan had previously supported the studio's decision to give *Wonder Woman 1984* (2020) a simultaneous release, stating that he perceived that situation to have been handled properly, but said he had been excluded from any discussions regarding the postponed release of *Tenet*.[57][58]\n\n\nIn September 2021, it was announced that Nolan would write and direct a biographical film set during World War II about Oppenheimer, with Cillian Murphy in negotiations to star.[59][60] Due to his strained relationship with Warner Bros., Nolan approached multiple studios for the project, including Sony, Universal, Paramount, and Apple.[61][62] According to insiders, Paramount was ruled out early in the process in relation to the replacement of CEO and chairman Jim Gianopulos with Brian Robbins, an advocate for increased streaming-service releases.[62]\n\n\nNolan ended up going to Universal because he had previously worked with Donna Langley, chairwoman and chief content officer of the NBCUniversal studio group, on an unsuccessful attempt to make a film version of the UK television series *The Prisoner*. He was unable to \"'crack' the adaptation\", but they stayed in touch.[63] Langley agreed with Nolan's strong stance in favor of traditional film exhibition in theaters. Therefore, Universal agreed to finance and distribute *Oppenheimer*, with production set to begin in the first quarter of 2022.[64] The studio also agreed to Nolan's terms, which included a production budget of $100 million, an equal marketing budget, an exclusive theatrical window ranging from 90 to 120 days, 20 percent of the film's first-dollar gross, and a three-week period both before and after the film's opening in which Universal could not release another new film.[62][2]\n\n\n\n### Writing[edit]\n\n\n![Christopher Nolan at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival.](image)Writer, director, and producer Christopher Nolan\n*Oppenheimer* is the first screenplay written by Nolan in the first person, as he wanted the narrative to be conveyed from Oppenheimer's perspective. He described the \"texture\" of the film being \"how the personal interacts with the historic and the geopolitical\" with the intention of making it a cautionary tale.[53][65][66] He began developing the script after he completed *Tenet* and wrote it in only a few months; he had already been thinking about making a film about Oppenheimer for over 20 years.[53] A major plot element is Oppenheimer's response to the long-term consequences of his actions. Nolan wished to explore the phenomenon of delayed reactions, as he felt people are not \"necessarily confronted with the strongest or worst elements of [their actions] in the moment\".[67] He also chose to alternate between scenes in color and black-and-white to convey the story from both subjective and objective perspectives, respectively,[68] with most of Oppenheimer's view shown via the former, while the latter depicts a \"more objective view of his story from a different character's point of view\".[69][67] Wanting to make the film as subjective as possible, the production team decided to include visions of Oppenheimer's conceptions of the quantum world and waves of energy.[70] Nolan noted that Oppenheimer never publicly apologized for his role in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but still desired to portray Oppenheimer as feeling genuine guilt for his actions, believing this to be accurate.[71]\n\n\n\n> \n> I think of any character I've dealt with, Oppenheimer is by far the most ambiguous and paradoxical. Which, given that I've made three Batman films, is saying a lot.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014 Christopher Nolan, *Total Film*[72]\n\nNolan began by trying to find the \"thread that connected the quantum realm, the vibration of energy, and Oppenheimer's own personal journey\" and sought to portray the difficulties in his life, particularly regarding his sex life.[54] As such, Nolan wanted to candidly portray his affair with Jean Tatlock. He also wanted to explore Tatlock's influence on Oppenheimer's life, since she was a Communist, which had \"enormous ramifications for [Oppenheimer's] later life and his ultimate fate\".[73] Nolan also sought to explore the relationship between Oppenheimer and Admiral Lewis Strauss, former chair of the Atomic Energy Commission, having been inspired by the relationship between Mozart and Antonio Salieri as depicted in *Amadeus* (1984).[67]\n\n\nAnother critical moment of the film was the meeting in which President Harry S. Truman called Oppenheimer a \"crybaby\". Nolan wanted to convey the scene from Oppenheimer's perspective and felt it was a \"massive moment of disillusion, a huge turning point [for Oppenheimer] in his approach to trying to deal with the consequences of what he'd been involved with\", while also underscoring that it is a \"huge shift in perception about the reality of Oppenheimer's perception\".[53] He wanted to execute a quick tonal shift after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, desiring to go from the \"highest triumphalism, the highest high, to the lowest low in the shortest amount of screen time possible\".[66] For the ending, Nolan chose to make it intentionally vague to be open to interpretation and refrained from being didactic or conveying specific messages in his work. However, he did have the intention to have a \"strong set of troubling reverberations at the end\".[71]\n\n\nNolan first became aware of Oppenheimer as a youth, after hearing the lyric \"How can I save my little boy from Oppenheimer's deadly toy?\" in the Sting song \"Russians\" (1985).[67] He was also inspired by his fears of nuclear holocaust throughout childhood, as he lived during the era of Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) and the anti-nuclear protests in RAF Greenham Common. He felt that \"while our relationship with that [nuclear] fear has ebbed and flowed with time, the threat itself never actually went away\", and felt the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine had caused a resurgence of nuclear anxiety.[54] Nolan had also penned a script for a biopic of Howard Hughes approximately during the time of production of Martin Scorsese's *The Aviator* (2004), which had given him insight on how to write a script regarding a person's life.[53] Emily Blunt described the *Oppenheimer* script as \"emotional\" and resembling that of a thriller, while also remarking that Nolan had \"Trojan-Horsed a biopic into a thriller\".[72]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\n*Oppenheimer* marks the sixth collaboration between Nolan and Murphy, and the first starring Murphy as the lead. To prepare for the role, the actor did what he summarized as \"an awful lot of reading\" on Oppenheimer's life and had also been inspired by David Bowie's appearance in the 1970s.[74][8][67] Nolan called Murphy one day to ask him to play the part, and Murphy enthusiastically accepted and was excited to play a lead role in a Nolan film. Afterward, Nolan flew to Dublin to meet with Murphy, who read the script in Nolan's hotel room.[75] Murphy lost an undisclosed amount of weight for the role in order to better match the real-life Oppenheimer's gaunt appearance.[76] Nolan also set up a phone call between Murphy and Nobel laureate Kip Thorne, who had previously worked with Nolan on *Interstellar* (2014).[53] As a graduate student, Thorne had attended some of Oppenheimer's seminars, and explained to Murphy his experience with Oppenheimer's gift for facilitating group discussions of difficult scientific concepts.[53]\n\n\nThe casting process was so secretive that some cast members did not know which role they would be playing until they signed on.[35] Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon, and Emily Blunt took pay cuts to work on the film, with each earning $4\u00a0million in lieu of their usual $10\u201320\u00a0million upfront salary.[77] Downey went to Nolan's house to read the script, which was printed in black on red paper.[78] Downey would later describe *Oppenheimer* as \"the best film\" in which he has appeared to date.[79] Blunt met Nolan in Los Angeles and, when she was offered the role of Katherine \"Kitty\" Oppenheimer, she enthusiastically accepted; she also contacted Murphy to get an expectation of what working with Nolan would be like.[78] Asked to play the part of Leslie Groves, Damon\u2014who had appeared in Nolan's *Interstellar*\u2014was taking a break from acting as a result of negotiations with his wife in couples therapy, but signed on to *Oppenheimer* as he had reserved one exception: if Nolan offered him a role in a film.[80] Nolan cast writer-director Benny Safdie as physicist Edward Teller after asking director Paul Thomas Anderson about his experience directing Safdie in *Licorice Pizza* (2021).[81] Safdie had worked alongside a nuclear physicist at Columbia University while in high school.[67]\n\n\nIt is Nolan's first film since *Batman Begins* (2005) to not feature Michael Caine. When asked about Caine's absence from the film, Nolan stated, \"He's with us in spirit, but not an actual actor. No, no. He wasn't able to join us for this one. But he's always with us in spirit, and I've had the most wonderful collaboration with him over the years.\"[82][83]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nFilming took place at the University of California, Berkeley in May 2022.\n\nPre-production had begun by January 2022 in New Mexico, where a two-day casting call took place in Santa Fe and Los Alamos for people to audition to play local residents, military personnel, and scientists.[84][85] Another casting call was held in February.[86]\n\n\nPrincipal photography began on February 28, 2022, at Ghost Ranch in New Mexico,[87] and lasted for 57 days with Hoyte van Hoytema serving as cinematographer.[76][22] The original shooting schedule had set aside approximately 85 days for principal photography.[88] During pre-production, it had become clear there was no way to shoot a feature film for $100 million over that many days on location all over the United States.[88] To free up money in the film's budget for location shooting in California and New Jersey and for construction of high-quality historically accurate sets in New Mexico, Nolan compressed the shooting schedule to 55 days.[88] Murphy, who appears in nearly every scene, described the pace as \"insane\".[88]\n\n\nGary Oldman said he would be on set for a day in May for \"one scene, a page and a half\".[50] Nolan filmed his eldest child, his daughter Flora, in a scene in which she played a young woman disintegrated in a nuclear explosion. It appears in the film as one of Oppenheimer's visions, in which Nolan intended to show \"that if you create the ultimate destructive power, it will also destroy those who are near and dear to you\".[54]\n\n\nThe film used a combination of IMAX 65\u00a0mm and 65 mm large-format film.[8] It is also the first film to shoot sections on IMAX black-and-white photographic film, which Kodak created and FotoKem developed specifically for the film.[89][90] Van Hoytema used 50\u00a0mm and 80\u00a0mm Hasselblad lenses when filming on the IMAX MKIV or IMAX MSM 9802 cameras, while scenes shot on the Panavision Panaflex System 65 Studio cameras were shot using Panavision Sphero 65 and Panavision System 65 lenses. Said Van Hoytema, \"When shooting our close-ups, we didn't want the camera to be six feet away from our subject. We wanted to be much tighter, so that you really feel the perspective and the intimacy. Also, I knew we would be filming in low-light situations and would need to shoot at T1.4 rather than a T4.\"[91] Additionally, the production had Panavision construct a custom probe lens to allow the filmmakers to use IMAX cameras for macro photography and microphotography to record the film's miniature effects.[92] In the second week of April, filming took place on location at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.[93] Filming also occurred in California,[49] primarily around the campus of the University of California, Berkeley.[94] Scenes set in the city of Berkeley itself were filmed in Pasadena.[95]\n\n\nDuring a 2021 research trip, Nolan discovered that Los Alamos had drastically changed from its 1940s appearance and could not be used for exterior shots of the town; for example, the town's equivalent of a Main Street has a Starbucks.[87] Instead, the production team constructed a version of 1940s-era Los Alamos on top of a similar plateau at Ghost Ranch.[87] It took three months to build the set, which was used for only six shooting days.[87] The general plan was to shoot only exterior shots on the set at Ghost Ranch, then shoot interior shots on location inside various historic buildings in the real town of Los Alamos.[95] Interior shooting in Los Alamos began on March 8, 2022.[87] Many scenes in the film take place in academic lecture halls; to save time and money, the production team decided against attempting to reconstruct those halls as sets at Ghost Ranch, and shot them inside a historic Women's Army Corps dormitory in Los Alamos.[87] Scenes were also filmed in Oppenheimer's original cabin in Los Alamos, which had been restored. Kai Bird visited the set and was impressed by Murphy's performance as Oppenheimer during filming.[96] The New York hotel scenes were shot in Albuquerque's Old Post Office building, while the Washington, D.C. scenes were shot in state government buildings in the state capital of Santa Fe.[95]\n\n\nFilming involved the use of real explosives to recreate the Trinity nuclear test, forgoing the use of computer-generated graphics.[97] When this news first broke online, many fans (aware of Nolan's famous preference for in-camera practical effects) thought it meant he had set off a real atomic bomb.[2] Nolan later remarked that it was both \"flattering\" and \"scary\" that his fans would think that of him.[2] The production team was able to obtain government permission to film at White Sands Missile Range, but only at highly inconvenient hours, and therefore chose to film the scene elsewhere in the New Mexico desert.[2][95] The production filmed the Trinity test scenes in Belen, New Mexico, with Murphy climbing a 100-foot steel tower, a replica of the original site used in the Manhattan Project, in rough weather.[2][95] A special set was built in which gasoline, propane, aluminum powder, and magnesium were used to create the explosive effect.[54] Although they used miniatures for the practical effect, the film's special effects supervisor Scott R. Fisher referred to them as \"big-atures\", since the special effects team had tried to build the models as physically large as possible. To make the models look closer to their intended real-life size, the team used forced perspective.[98][99] Visualizations of the interactions between atoms, molecules and energy waves, as well as the depiction of stars, black holes and supernovas, were also achieved through practical methods. Nolan claimed the film contains no computer-generated effects,[100] and used practical effects to achieve \"real-world imagery\".[101] Filming wrapped in May 2022.[102]\n\n\n\n### Post-production[edit]\n\n\nDuring post-production, editing was completed by Jennifer Lame, who had previously edited *Tenet*.[8] While inspecting the footage during editing, Nolan and Lame performed \"character passes\" to ensure all the characters were properly displayed on screen, due to the film having a faster pace than most traditional blockbusters.[67] Visual effects were handled by DNEG, which produced more than 100 VFX shots from more than 400 practically shot elements,[103] marking their eighth collaboration with Nolan. Andrew Jackson was the visual effects supervisor,[104] who stated that the film utilized mostly \"invisible\" visual effects through \"'in-camera' special effects created on set\".[105] Digital compositing was used for the Trinity scene to add multi-layers to the explosion which was shot in a multifaceted viewpoint.[106]\n\n\n\n## Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Oppenheimer (soundtrack)\n\nLudwig G\u00f6ransson composed the score for the film, after doing so for Nolan's previous film, *Tenet*.[8] G\u00f6ransson's score was featured in a trailer for the film on May 8, 2023.[107] It was also featured in the Universal Pictures exclusive five-minute Opening Look on July 13.[108][109] Nolan had advised him to use the violin for Oppenheimer's central theme in the film, with G\u00f6ransson remarking that he had felt that it could go from \"the most romantic, beautiful tone in a split second to neurotic and heart wrenching, horror sounds\".[67]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Marketing[edit]\n\n\n*Oppenheimer*'s teaser trailer was released on July 28, 2022, featuring a live countdown to 5:29\u00a0a.m. (MDT) on July 16, 2023, the 78th anniversary of the first detonation of an atomic weapon; it premiered in screenings of *Nope* before being posted online on Universal's social media profiles.[110] *Empire* commented that it is exemplary of Nolan's style: \"heady, brooding stuff with a real sense of weight\".[111] In December 2022, two trailers for the film premiered in front of *Avatar: The Way of Water*, with one being exclusive to IMAX theaters and the other being shown in all other formats. The latter was eventually released online.[112][113] In May 2023, an official main trailer debuted during preview screenings of *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3*. It was subsequently released to the public on May 8, 2023, alongside a theatrical release poster.[114]\n\n\n\n### Theatrical release[edit]\n\n\n*Oppenheimer* had its world premiere at Le Grand Rex in Paris on July 11, 2023,[115] followed by the British premiere at Odeon Luxe Leicester Square in London on July 13,[116] and the American premiere at AMC Loews Lincoln Square in New York City on July 17.[117] Both the London and the New York premieres were affected by the SAG-AFTRA strike, as some actors left the London premiere early,[116] and Universal Pictures canceled the red carpet event for the New York premiere.[117] SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher later claimed the studios \"duped\" the guild into accepting a twelve-day-extension for negotiations to continue promoting summer films like *Oppenheimer*.[118] *Oppenheimer* was released theatrically on July 21, 2023, by Universal Pictures.[8][119] In addition to standard digital cinemas, it will be also released in various film formats including IMAX 70\u00a0mm (30 prints), standard 70 mm (113 prints) and 35 mm (around 80 prints).[120]\n\n\nThe film was released on the same day as *Barbie*, a fantasy comedy film directed by Greta Gerwig based on Mattel's Barbie fashion dolls and media franchise, and distributed by Warner Bros. Many speculated that the decision by Warner Bros. to release *Barbie* on the same day as *Oppenheimer* was made in order to deplete ticket sales of *Oppenheimer* as retaliation for Nolan releasing the film with Universal.[121] Due to the tonal and genre dissonance between the two films, many social media users created memes about how the two films appealed to different audiences,[122] and how they should be viewed as a double feature.[123] The trend was dubbed \"Barbenheimer\",[124] and was labeled as counterprogramming during a summer of \"entertainment industry meltdown\".[125] Cillian Murphy had endorsed the phenomenon, saying \"My advice would be for people to go see both, on the same day. If they are good films, then that's cinema's gain.\"[126]\n\n\nAs of March 2022, Universal Pictures halted the release of its titles in Russia, joining other major American film distributors in the boycott against the country following its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.[127] *Oppenheimer* had also been banned by Russia's Ministry of Culture, which had refused to license screenings of the film, stating that it did not meet their goals of \"preserving and strengthening traditional Russian spiritual values\".[128]\n\n\nIn Japan, the only country to have been attacked by nuclear bombs, the film is yet to have a release date. In late June 2023, a Universal Pictures spokesperson told *Variety* that \"plans have not been finalized in all markets\". *Variety* also pointed out that it is not uncommon for American films to be released in Japan months after the theatrical debut in the United States.[129]\n\n\n\n#### Classifications and censorship[edit]\n\n\nIn the United States, the film received an R-rating from the Motion Picture Association for \"some sexuality, nudity, and language\", meaning anyone under 17 needs to be accompanied by an adult guardian. It is Nolan's first film to receive that rating since *Insomnia* (2002).[130] In Australia, the film received an MA 15+ rating from the Australian Classification Board board for \"strong sex and a suicide scene\".[131] In the United Kingdom, the film received a 15 certificate from the British Board of Film Classification for \"strong language and sex\", meaning anyone under the age of 15 cannot be admitted to view the film.[132] In some countries, including those in the Middle East, South Asia and Southeast Asia, Universal distributed a version of the film with Florence Pugh's nude body covered by a computer-generated black dress.[133][134][135]\n\n\nIn India, *Oppenheimer* was released with all scenes depicting nudity, sex and cigarette smoking being censored, earning the U/A certificate from the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) while retaining the running time.[136] The audio of the scene in which Tatlock directs Oppenheimer to read a verse from the Hindu scripture Bhagavad Gita, \"I am become Death, destroyer of worlds\", while the two have intercourse, remained intact.[137] As NDTV reported, the Minister for Information and Broadcasting Anurag Thakur questioned how the CBFC certified the film with the verse heard during such circumstance in the first place, and asked the scene to be deleted.[138]\n\n\nThe Hindutva was angered by the scene and demanded its removal.[139] Among them was journalist Uday Mahurkar, who wrote an open letter to Nolan calling the scene a \"direct assault on religious beliefs of a billion tolerant Hindus\", and demanded its removal from all releases of *Oppenheimer* across the world.[137] On the other hand, actor Nitish Bharadwaj, told *The Times of India* that \"The use of this verse in the film should also be understood from Oppenheimer's emotional state of mind. A scientist thinks of his creation 24x7x365 days, irrespective of what he is doing. His mind space is consumed fully of his creation & the physical act is just a natural mechanical act.\"[140]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Oppenheimer* will be released on 4K Blu-ray, regular Blu-ray and DVD formats including digital on November 21, 2023.[141]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\nAs of November\u00a014, 2023[update], *Oppenheimer* has grossed $325.3\u00a0million in the United States and Canada and $625.4 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $950.7\u00a0million.[3][4] It is the second-highest-grossing R-rated film of all-time, behind *Joker* (2019).[142][143] In September 2023, *Oppenheimer* became the highest-grossing biographical film of all time, surpassing *Bohemian Rhapsody* (2018).[144][145]\n\n\nBy August 2023, *Oppenheimer* had become the highest-grossing film ever to not reach the top spot at the domestic box office, though in its sixth weekend it topped the worldwide box office with a total of $38.12 million, surpassing *Barbie* for the first time.[146] It is also the highest grossing World War II-related film, surpassing *Dunkirk* (2017), also a Nolan film.[147][148][149][150] Additionally, *Oppenheimer* became one of the top five highest-grossing IMAX releases, earning $183 million[151] (approximately 20% of its total gross), over $17 million of which was earned from the 30 screens showing IMAX 70\u00a0mm prints.[152] The film was booked to be rereleased in IMAX theatres on November 3, including six IMAX 70mm prints, as these theatres reported selling out during the film\u2019s initial release.[151]\n\n\n\n#### United States and Canada[edit]\n\n\nIn the United States and Canada, *Oppenheimer* was released alongside *Barbie*.[153] The week of their releases, AMC Theatres announced that over 40,000 AMC Stubs members had already pre-booked tickets to both films on the same day.[154] After grossing $33\u00a0million on its first day (including $10.5\u00a0million from Thursday night previews), it went on to debut to $82.5 million,[155] finishing second behind *Barbie* and marking one of the best opening weekends ever for an R-rated drama. 64% of the audience was male, with 33% being 18\u201334 years old. The Barbenheimer phenomenon was credited with boosting interest in the film, with a total of 79% of tickets sold over the weekend being for the two films (27% for *Oppenheimer*), a combined total of 18.5\u00a0million people.[156] The film's opening weekend was Nolan's best for an original film, being the highest of his filmography outside of the latter two films from *The Dark Knight* trilogy.[157] It achieved the third-highest opening weekend for a biopic film, behind *The Passion of the Christ* (2004) and *American Sniper* (2014).[158] The film made $46.2\u00a0million in its second weekend (a drop of 44%), remaining in second behind *Barbie*.[159][160] The film made $28.7\u00a0million in its third weekend, finishing third behind *Barbie* and newcomer *Meg 2: The Trench*.[161] On August 16, *Oppenheimer* surpassed *Sing* (2016) to become the highest-grossing film to never reach the number one spot at the box office.[162][163] During its fourth weekend, the film made $18.8 million (a drop of 35%) rising back up to second place.[164] In its fifth and sixth weekends, the film grossed $10.7 million and $9 million (a drop of 43% and 16% respectively), finishing in third and fourth place at the box office and passing $300 million domestically in its sixth weekend.[164]\n\n\n\n#### Other territories[edit]\n\n\nOutside the United States and Canada, the film grossed $98\u00a0million in its opening weekend.[165] The following weekend, *Oppenheimer* earned $77.1\u00a0million, dropping by just 21% to become Nolan's highest-grossing film in 30 countries, including India, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Turkey.[166] In its third weekend, *Oppenheimer* grossed $52.8 million (a drop of 31%)[167] and $32 million in its fourth weekend.[168] The film continued to hold well in the following weeks, making $32 million and $29.1 million in its fifth and sixth weekends.[169][170] As of September 10, 2023, the highest grossing territories were the United Kingdom ($72\u00a0million), Germany ($46.9\u00a0million), China ($46.8 million), France ($40.1 million) and Australia ($25.9\u00a0million).[171]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe performances of Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. were praised.\n\nThe film received critical acclaim.[a] Critics praised *Oppenheimer* primarily for its screenplay, the performances of the cast (particularly Murphy and Downey), and the visuals;[182][183][184][185] it was frequently cited as one of the best films of Nolan,[186][187][178] and of 2023, although some criticism was aimed towards the writing of the female characters.[182] *Hindustan Times* reported that the film was also hailed as one of the best films of the 21st century.[188] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 93% of 471 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.6/10. The website's consensus reads: \"*Oppenheimer* marks another engrossing achievement from Christopher Nolan that benefits from Murphy's tour-de-force performance and stunning visuals.\"[189] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 88 out of 100, based on 69 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[190] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled by PostTrak gave it a 93% overall positive score, with 74% saying they would definitely recommend the film.[156]\n\n\nRichard Roeper of the *Chicago Sun-Times* awarded *Oppenheimer* a perfect four out of four stars, describing it as \"magnificent\" and \"one of the best films of the 21st century\".[191] *The A.V. Club*'s Matthew Jackson deemed it a \"masterpiece\", adding that \"it's Christopher Nolan's best film so far, a step up to a new level for one of our finest filmmakers, and a movie that burns itself into your brain\".[192] *Empire*'s Dan Jolin labeled it a \"masterfully constructed character study\", taking particular note of Murphy's performance and van Hoytema's IMAX cinematography.[193] Peter Suderman writing for *Reason* magazine said that the film leaves the viewer with a sense of \"fear and foreboding about the horror of full-on nuclear conflict in the wake of the nuclear bomb. Humanity is both great *and* terrible. *Oppenheimer* isn't just a movie\u2014it's a warning.\"[194]\n\n\nMatt Zoller Seitz, writing for *RogerEbert.com* gave *Oppenheimer* a full four stars rating. He lauded Nolan's storytelling, exploration of Oppenheimer's character, and the film's technical achievements, concluding: \"As a physical experience, *Oppenheimer* is something else entirely\u2014it's hard to say exactly what, and that's what's so fascinating about it\".[195] Peter Travers described the film as a \"monumental achievement\" and \"one of the best films you'll see anywhere\".[196] Caryn James of BBC Culture similarly termed it \"boldly imaginative and [Nolan's] most mature work yet\", adding that it combined the \"explosive, commercially-enticing action of *The Dark Knight* trilogy\" with the \"cerebral underpinnings\" of *Memento*, *Inception* and *Tenet*.[197] *IGN* critic Siddhant Adlakha gave *Oppenheimer* 10/10, describing it as \"a three-hour biopic that plays like a jolting thriller\" and Nolan's most \"abstract\" work yet.[198]\n\n\nSaibal Chatterjee from NDTV rated the film 4.5 stars out of 5 and stated: \"*Oppenheimer*, a cinematic achievement of blinding brilliance, achieves a sublime combination of visual grandeur, technical flair, emotional intimacy and an examination of the limits of human endeavor and ambition\".[199] In August 2023, it ranked number 3 on *Collider*'s list of \"The 20 Best Drama Movies of the 2020s So Far,\" writing that Nolan \"explores the world's obsession with destructive nuclear weapons from the perspective of their creator; using the Greek myth of Dante [*sic*] as an inspiration, *Oppenheimer* makes it clear that once this type of power is unleashed, it is bound to be used again.\"[200]\n\n\nDespite praising the film's themes and performances, CNN's Brian Lowry believed that \"Nolan juggles a lot, in a way that somewhat works to the movie's detriment\".[201] While acknowledging the contribution of \"American scientists and American enterprise\", Brett Mason noted that the film omits the crucial contributions of non-Americans that ensured the work was able to commence as early as December 1941: \"Nolan completely ignores the crucial role that British science and Australian physicist Mark Oliphant played in jump-starting the quest.\"[202] Writing for the *Los Angeles Times*, Justin Chang staunchly defended Nolan's accurate depiction of how Oppenheimer could not see the true victims of his work. Chang wrote that instead of satisfying \"representational completists\" by detouring to Hiroshima and Nagasaki, \"Nolan treats them instead as a profound absence, an indictment by silence\".[203]\n\n\n\n#### Accuracy and omissions[edit]\n\n\nThe film was noted for its accuracy, with some scenes being taken word-for-word out of the book or real life events.[204] Many of the changes are small embellishments or changes from real life. For example, Oppenheimer was not as excited about his discovery of black holes as shown in the film, since he did not know how significant it would become; the study was indeed released on the same day Germany invaded Poland, as shown in the film. During the Trinity test, Donald Hornig had his hand on the kill switch for a faster reaction time, not near it as depicted in the film. Truman did call Oppenheimer a \"crybaby\", but in a letter to Dean Acheson one year later, not immediately after meeting Oppenheimer.[204][205]\n\n\nThe scene where Oppenheimer poisons his professor's apple is based on accounts that Oppenheimer gave of the incident, but it is unclear whether it occurred in real life.[206] In the film, Oppenheimer is depicted as putting potassium cyanide in the apple before having a change of heart the next day, and then narrowly preventing the apple from being eaten. There is no evidence that Niels Bohr nearly ate the apple, or had any involvement in the incident.[204] Oppenheimer and Einstein were friends,[207] but the specific conversations which the film revolves around never happened.[204] Oppenheimer took his concerns about an unstoppable chain reaction to Arthur Compton, not Einstein.[204]\n\n\nIn addition to their interpersonal conflicts, Strauss had another reason to undermine Oppenheimer's credibility by revoking his security clearance: Oppenheimer was opposed to further development of the hydrogen bomb by the United States. Scott Sagan describes the loss of Oppenheimer's influence to constrain the nuclear arms race between the U.S. and the Soviet Union as a \"broader tragedy\" less clearly depicted in the film than the scientist's personal tragedy, but he called the production highly accurate otherwise for a \"Hollywood movie\".[208] Many efforts undertaken at other Manhattan Project sites, such as Hanford, Washington and Oak Ridge, Tennessee were not shown.[205] Most of them, overseen by General Leslie Groves, focused on producing the nuclear explosives.[209] In addition to the team at Los Alamos, those working at other Project sites, particularly the University of Chicago's Metallurgical Laboratory, also expressed concerns about using the atomic bomb against Japan.[210]\n\n\n\n#### Influence[edit]\n\n\nThe renewed attention to the site and associated nuclear testing encouraged the United States Congress to revise the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (1990), which provided compensation programs for people affected by radiation and nuclear testing during the Cold War, known as \"Downwinders\" and primarily consisting of the Navajo Nation. The United States Senate approved amendments to accommodate additional services to people in New Mexico, but it has not passed US Congress as the House of Representatives had not yet debated its inclusion as part of the national defense bill for the 2024 Fiscal Year.[211]\n\n\n\n#### Accolades[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Award\n | Date of ceremony\n | Category\n | Nominee(s)\n | Result\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Golden Trailer Awards | June 29, 2023\n | Best Drama\n | \"Secrets\" (Trailer Park, Inc.)\n | Won\n | [212][213] |\n| Best Summer 2023 Blockbuster Trailer\n | Won\n |\n| Best Sound Editing\n | Won\n |\n| Best Thriller\n | \"Lightmaker\" (Inside Job)\n | Nominated\n |\n| Best Drama TV Spot (for a Feature FIlm)\n | \"Charge\" (Inside Job)\n | Nominated\n |\n| Best Thriller TV Spot (for a Feature Film)\n | Nominated\n |\n| Best Sound Editing in a TV Spot (for a Feature Film)\n | Nominated\n |\n| Hollywood Critics Association Midseason Film Awards | June 30, 2023 | Most Anticipated Film\n | *Oppenheimer* | Runner-up\n | [214] |\n| Hollywood Music in Media Awards | November 15, 2023 | Best Original Score \u2014 Feature Film | Ludwig G\u00f6ransson | Nominated\n | [215] |\n| Grammy Awards | February 4, 2024 | Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media | Pending\n | [216] |\n| Best Arrangement, Instrumental or A Cappella | Ludwig G\u00f6ransson (for \"Can You Hear the Music\") | Pending\n |\n| Best Instrumental Composition | Pending\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of films about nuclear issues\n* List of World War II films since 1990\n* *Oppenheimer*, a 1980 TV series about Oppenheimer, portrayed by Sam Waterston\n* *Fat Man and Little Boy*, a 1989 film about the Manhattan Project\n* *Doctor Atomic*, a 2005 opera about Oppenheimer, composed by John Adams\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[172][173][174][175][176][177][178][179][180][181]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"*Oppenheimer* (15)\".

It is the sequel to *F9* (2021), the tenth main installment, and the eleventh installment overall in the *Fast & Furious* franchise. It stars Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto alongside an ensemble cast including Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges, John Cena, Nathalie Emmanuel, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, Scott Eastwood, Daniela Melchior, Alan Ritchson, Helen Mirren, Brie Larson, Rita Moreno, Jason Statham, Jason Momoa, and Charlize Theron. In the film, Toretto must protect his family from Dante Reyes (Momoa), who seeks revenge for his father's death and the loss of his family's fortune.\n\n\nWith a tenth film planned since 2014, and a two-part finale planned since October 2020, Lin was confirmed to return to direct with the main cast attached. The film's official title was revealed when principal photography began in April 2022. Lin left as director later that month, citing creative differences, though he retained writing and producing credits. Leterrier was then hired as his replacement a week later and performed several uncredited rewrites to the screenplay. Longtime franchise composer Brian Tyler returned to score the film. With an estimated production budget of $340\u00a0million, *Fast X* would be the eighth-most expensive film ever made. Filming lasted until that August, taking place in London, Rome, Turin, other Italian cities, Lisbon, and Los Angeles.\n\n\n*Fast X* premiered in Rome on May 12, 2023, and was released in the United States on May 19, by Universal Pictures. The film received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for its action sequences and Momoa's performance but criticism towards the writing. The film grossed $714\u00a0million worldwide, becoming the fifth-highest-grossing film of 2023. A sequel is in development and scheduled to be released on April 4, 2025.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nDominic Toretto and his team are requested by the Agency to steal a computer chip during its transit in Rome. Dom and his wife Letty Ortiz stay behind with his son Brian \"Little B\" Marcos, while the rest of the team, consisting of Roman Pearce, Tej Parker, Han Lue, and Ramsey, travels to Rome. A wounded Cipher arrives at Dom's home and informs him and Letty that Dante Reyes, the son of drug lord Hernan Reyes, has turned her crew against her and is using them to target Dom as revenge for his father's death and the loss of his family's fortune ten years prior.[b] When Little Nobody says that there is no Agency mission in Rome, Dom and Letty realize that Dante set them up and they go to rescue the team.\n\n\nIn Rome, Dante releases a metal ball bomb into the streets. Dom pushes it into the Tiber River, minimizing the damage, but Letty is arrested. Agent Aimes, the Agency's de facto leader since Mr. Nobody's disappearance,[c] believes that Dom and his team are responsible for the bombing and begins a manhunt. In Los Angeles, Dom's brother Jakob rescues Little B and Mia, his and Dom's sister, from a squad sent by Dante to kidnap Little B and with her approval, takes Little B to a secret location in Portugal, where they will await Dom. Mr. Nobody's daughter, Tess, is convinced of the team's innocence and uses God's Eye[d] to find Dom in Naples, informing him that Dante is in Rio de Janeiro.\n\n\nThere, Dom confronts Dante and meets Isabel Neves, the sister of Little B's late mother Elena.[e] Dom later challenges Dante to a race, along with Isabel and his ally, Diogo. However, Dante wins while killing Diogo and injuring Isabel. Tess visits Letty at the black site and covertly wounds her to send her to the prison's treatment center, where Letty meets Cipher. They discover the black site is located in Antarctica and they must work together to escape. In London, Dom's team turns to Deckard Shaw for help, through the convincing of Han after a scuffle between himself and Deckard. \n\n\nAimes joins forces with Dom to fight Dante. Dante locates Little B in Portugal and kidnaps him. As Dom is cornered by mercenaries, Jakob sacrifices himself to take them all out, allowing Dom to rescue his son. Dante again corners Dom and his son, just as Roman, Tej, Han, and Ramsey arrive by plane to aid Dom. Realizing too late, Dom tells Roman to turn the plane around, but Aimes, revealed to be working for Dante, shoots down the plane, leaving each member of the team's fates unknown. Dom drives off the edge of the dam they are on to avoid Dante's trap, but Dante has the dam rigged with explosives and activates them, leaving Dom and Little B's fates unknown as well. In Antarctica, Gisele Yashar, who was presumed dead,[f] emerges from a submarine to rescue Letty and Cipher.\n\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, Luke Hobbs infiltrates an abandoned theatre with a team of agents where he is contacted by Dante who warns him that he was the one who killed his father and that he will be his next target.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of Fast & Furious cast members and List of Fast & Furious characters\n\n* Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto:  \nA former criminal and professional street racer who has retired and settled down with his wife, Letty Ortiz, and his son, Brian Marcos.[6] In an interview, Louis Leterrier described *Fast X* as exploring the fallout of Dom's actions in previous installments, saying \"[Dom] has fought so hard to keep faith and protect family [but] there is a price to pay. His enemies are coming after him\".[7]\n* Michelle Rodriguez as Letty Ortiz: Dom's wife and a former criminal and professional street racer.[6]\n* Tyrese Gibson as Roman Pearce: An ex-habitual offender, expert street racer, and a member of Dom's team.[6]\n* Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges as Tej Parker: A tech expert, mechanic, and a member of Dom's team.[6]\n* John Cena as Jakob Toretto: Dom and Mia's brother and a master thief, assassin, and high-performance driver who once worked as an agent for Mr. Nobody.[6]\n* Nathalie Emmanuel as Ramsey: A computer hacktivist and a member of Dom's team.[6] Emmanuel said her character would see increased involvement in *Fast X* compared to the previous films.[8]\n* Jordana Brewster as Mia Toretto: Dom and Jakob's sister and a member of Dom's team who has two children with her partner, Brian O'Conner.[6]\n* Sung Kang as Han Lue: An expert drifter and member of Dom's team who previously faked his death during a covert operation for Mr. Nobody.[9]\n* Scott Eastwood as Little Nobody: A government law enforcement agent who worked under Mr. Nobody.[6]\n* Daniela Melchior as Isabel Neves:[10] A Brazilian street racer and the sister of Dom's former girlfriend and Little B's mother, Elena Neves.[11]\n* Alan Ritchson as Aimes: The new leader of Mr. Nobody's agency who is covertly working with Dante.[12] In early drafts, Aimes and Dante were brothers, and Ritchson revealed the film's plot twist was filmed alongside another ending, saying, \"Aimes wouldn't care [if] he's evil [if] his methods made him feel like he was a good guy\".[13]\n* Helen Mirren as Magdalene \"Queenie\" Ellmanson-Shaw: The leader of a female militia and an ally of Dom, as well as the mother of his former enemies Deckard and Owen.[14] Mirren drew inspiration for the character from her aunt (also nicknamed Queenie) and from her performance as Queen Elizabeth II in *The Queen* (2006).[15]\n* Brie Larson as Tess: Mr. Nobody's daughter and agent who allies with Dom and his crew.[16][17][18] According to Diesel, Larson drew inspiration from his daughter, Pauline, for the character.[19]\n* Rita Moreno as Abuelita Toretto:[20] Dom, Jakob, and Mia's paternal grandmother.[21][22]\n* Jason Statham as Deckard Shaw: A former opponent of Dom and his team, who became an ally and new member after saving his son. Deckard's younger brother, Owen, was hospitalized working for Cipher.[23]\n* Jason Momoa as Dante Reyes: The son of drug lord Hernan Reyes, seeking revenge against Dom and his crew for the death of his father and loss of his family's fortune in *Fast Five* (2011).[24][25]  \n Momoa described the character as Dom's foil,[26] saying Dante is \"very sadistic and androgynous and he's a bit of a peacock... He's got a lot of issues. He's definitely got some daddy issues\".[27] Momoa expressed a desire to play against type when portraying Dante, taking on a \"less macho\" character,[28] and he performed his own stunts for the film.[29]\n* Charlize Theron as Cipher: A criminal mastermind and cyberterrorist who was previously an enemy of Dom's team.[6][9] Leterrier described Cipher as the \"devil\", and speaking on her dynamic with Dante, Leterrier said, \"They are bad news, but one is more afraid than the other. One is worse news than the other\".[7][30]\n\n\nGal Gadot and Dwayne Johnson reprise their roles from the franchise uncredited as Gisele Yashar and Luke Hobbs during the final scene and mid-credits scene, respectively.[31][32][33] Joaquim de Almeida reprises his role as Hernan Reyes, a ruthless drug lord and Dante's father, from *Fast Five*, while Leo Abelo Perry portrays Brian \"Little B\" Marcos, Dom's son.[34] Luis Da Silva reprises his role from *Fast Five* as Diogo, a Brazilian street racer who allies with Dom and his crew.[35] Making cameo appearances are Brazilian singer Ludmilla as a race starter in Rio de Janeiro,[36] Pete Davidson as Bowie, a friend of Ramsey,[37] Paul Walker's daughter Meadow as a flight attendant helping Jakob,[38] and Debby Ryan and Josh Dun (credited as themselves) as a couple in an airport.[39]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Justin Lin, who directed five films in the franchise, originally returned as director of *Fast X*.\nIn November 2014, Universal Pictures chairwoman Donna Langley said there would be at least three more films in the franchise after *Furious 7* (2015).[40] In April 2017, producer Neal H. Moritz stated that the tenth entry would serve as the finale for the franchise with Chris Morgan attached as screenwriter.[41] In October 2017, Justin Lin entered negotiations to direct the ninth and tenth installments after directing four films in the series.[42] In February 2020, Vin Diesel hinted the film could be split in two,[43] which he confirmed in an April 2021 press conference, stating, \"There's so much ground to cover and so many places in so many locations that we have to visit\" as the rationale behind the decision for a two-part finale.[44] Prior to production, Diesel announced filming would take place in Italy, stating, \"I was asked, 'Would there ever be a *Fast* where you could film in Italy?', and I [promised] we would\".[45] While Morgan ultimately did not return as screenwriter, it was confirmed he would serve as an executive producer on the film, alongside Joseph M. Caracciolo, Jr., David Cain, Amanda Lewis, and Mark Bomback.[46]\n\n\nBy April 2022, a new screenplay draft was written by Lin and Dan Mazeau.[47] On June 5, 2022, Tyrese Gibson announced *Fast X* would see the franchise \"going back to its roots\", with reports indicating this to be a return to street racing elements of previous entries,[48] although shared details the film would also continue to explore the history of the Toretto family in a \"similar\" vein to *F9*;[49] Leterrier later revealed the film focuses on increased familial responsibilities, saying, \"Dom was always a lone wolf. He was living a quarter mile at a time [but] the stakes are real now. [He is] responsible for a human being, an innocent life [he] brought into the world\".[30] Gibson also expressed a desire for the franchise to film in South Africa, stating, \"me and Luda always had this idea [that] it's time for us to head to South Africa. It needs real estate in this franchise [because] it [has] a beautiful skyline with ocean. It's the *Fast and Furious* package\".[50] Ludacris later stated his favorite franchise filming location was his home city of Atlanta, Georgia,[51] and revealed that he did not anticipate returning to the franchise after his initial appearance in *2 Fast 2 Furious* (2003).[52] During an August 2022 interview with *ComicBook*, Nathalie Emmanuel said \"the stakes are higher on a more personal level in this [film]\", indicating a more grounded approach compared to previous installments.[53] In developing the character of Dante, Leterrier revealed they wanted to forge the \"anti-Dom\", saying, \"[Dante] is the yang of [Dom's] yin, the antichrist of his Christ\", and wanted to give Dante clear motivation with Dom's role in Dante's origin story, noting, \"There are strong ties with [Dante and Dom] and that is what makes an amazing villain because you understand why they became this and [their motivations]\".[30] Leterrier noted Larson's character as also being influenced by \"the generational legacy of the characters\", saying, \"Everybody [in the franchise] has a different point of view on Dom and his own influence on their lives. And that's how she [fits in]\".[30]\n\n\nDescribing the film's retcon of *Fast Five* (2011), Leterrier said it was to \"explore the price of justice\", noting, \"[We] *Rashomon*'ed [the fifth film] to experience it through the eyes of Reyes, with Dom and Brian the thieves. We [wanted to] guide the audience to rethink everything they've experienced in the franchise [because] a good antagonist has their own truth, [separate] from the protagonists\".[30] Leterrier noted the film touches on each previous installment, saying, \"The snowball [of Dom's actions] has picked up speed and became an avalanche\", and said his favorite film in the franchise is *Fast Five*.[30] Leterrier later revealed he performed several uncredited rewrites to the entire screenplay on his initial travel to the set, stating he lacked sleep for the first four days he worked on the film.[54] During the film's early promotional run, Leterrier said *Fast X* explores the potential breakup of family, noting \"people are going to need to take sides [and] alliances will need to be made\" compounded by \"[the] war brewing\" between the characters, saying \"there will be some tremendous casualties\".[55] He later confirmed the film will end on a cliffhanger,[56] and further hinted at character deaths, saying, \"The beauty of the end of this franchise [is] understanding these characters will [not] live forever. Only in Westerns do cowboys gallop out into the sunset. This is different; the stakes even more than they've been before\".[57] This was seemingly confirmed by Michelle Rodriguez, who considered the fan reaction to the ending, saying, \"You're going to feel so cheated in a way, but then so gratified and excited about what's to come. After 23 years of [making films], it's really tough at this stage to shock me, and they got me good\".[58] She reiterated this in a promotional interview with *Collider* for *Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves* (2023), saying the ending of *Fast X* would \"[leave] people really surprised and we're [going to] get open mouths at the end. In [the] theater, I was like, 'Oh my god. What have we done?!'\".[59]\n\n\nIn an interview with *Collider*, Universal Pictures producer Kelly McCormick stated the impact of COVID-19 and the production schedules of \"our interfering projects\" (like *Fast X* and its sequel) caused delays in developing the sequel to *Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw* (2019).[60] Filming in Turin required the Film Commission Torino Piemonte, local authorities, and city councilors to conduct a five-month planning schedule from September 2021 to January 2022, collaborating with the Departments of Culture to coordinate the city's major events, roads and transport, public, and security around filming requirements. Such planning included managing the overflight of drones and limitations on circulation made necessary for the management and safety of the set.[61]\n\n\n\n#### Vehicles[edit]\n\n\n*Fast X* is the first film in the series to feature electric cars, with leaked set photos featuring the 2024 Dodge Charger Daytona SRT Banshee Concept and the gull-winged DeLorean Alpha5. Other vehicles set to feature include the 2022 TorRed Dodge Charger R/T, the 2023 Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat Redeye, and the 1970 Charger R/T, the latter a franchise staple.[62] On June 27, 2022, it was reported *Fast X* would include the fan favorite orange and black Veilside Mazda RX-7 FD Fortune, which first featured in *The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift* (2006).[63] The inclusion of the electric Dodge Chargers in the film was confirmed upon release of the first trailer on February 9, 2023, with the \"Greys of Thunder\" Dodge Charger Daytona SRT also appearing in other promotional material. In an interview with Fox News, a Dodge spokesperson said the company \"has a long-standing marketing partnership with *Fast & Furious*\", which will continue with *Fast X*.[64] Other vehicles expected to feature in the film include the foreign-made Lamborghini Gallardo, Alfa Romeo 159, Nissan Silvia, Porsche 911 997 GT3 RS, Pagani Huayra Tricolore, and the Datsun 240Z, as well as the U.S.-made Chevrolet Impala and El Camino, Lenco BearCat Armoured Vehicle, and the 1966 Ford Fairlane.[65] In an interview with vehicle co-ordinator Dennis McCarthy, who worked on every *Fast & Furious* film since *Tokyo Drift* (2006), each significant car featured on screen required around seven duplicates, resulting in an estimated 200 cars built for *Fast X* to race-car standards required for the stunt work.[66] In April 2023, Momoa revealed that he personally contacted Jochen Zeitz, the CEO of Harley-Davidson, to secure six motorcycles to be used in the film for his character.[67] He is seen riding the Harley-Davidson Pan America throughout the movie, which was modified with an upgraded exhaust system and extra shielding.[68]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nJason Momoa, Daniela Melchior, Brie Larson, Alan Ritchson and Rita Moreno joined the main cast for *Fast X*.\n\nIn June 2021, Diesel announced the film would be split in a two-part culmination to the franchise, with principal photography slated to begin in January 2022 and take place back-to-back.[69][70] In December 2021, Dwayne Johnson ruled out returning for *Fast X*, and labeled an Instagram post by Diesel asking for his return as \"manipulation\",[71] with publications indicating he was referring to a feud with Diesel stemming from Diesel's role as an executive producer on *The Fate of the Furious* (2017).[72][73] He ultimately reprised his role as Luke Hobbs in a mid-credits scene cameo appearance.[32][33][31]\n\n\nIn early 2022, Jason Momoa was cast as Dante, the villain,[24] while Daniela Melchior, Brie Larson, and Alan Ritchson joined the cast by that April.[11][16][12] Keanu Reeves was originally approached to play Aimes, having been previously in talks to join the franchise with the role of the Eteon Director in *Hobbs & Shaw*, but plans shifted and Ritchson was contacted about taking over the role while filming *Ordinary Angels* (TBA), an offer he considered and accepted once production on that film was halted because of the announcement that the biggest blizzard in Winnipeg's history was coming to the set.[74] Larson was initially hesitant to join another franchise after the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), saying, \"I was scared of what would happen to me [by joining *Fast & Furious*]. But what I always come back to is, I have to live with myself in a way that nobody else has to. The choices I make, I have to live with, whether I regret them or not\",[75] but stated *Fast & Furious* was her \"dream franchise\", saying, \"I've been begging to be in this for years. Being part of something you've watched your whole life and that you love is an amazing feeling\".[76]\n\n\nIn a March 2023 interview with *Total Film*, Larson revealed she would portray Tess, the daughter of government agent and covert operations team leader Mr. Nobody; she described Tess as \"a bridge\", saying, \"she doesn't go along with the Agency. She believes in the legacy her father set up, standing with Dom and the Toretto family\".[77] Describing Momoa's addition, director Louis Leterrier said Dante is \"an incredible new character. It's 1,000 per cent Momoa\",[78] while Michelle Rodriguez said Dante is \"malicious but he can be playful. It's like a fresh energy. There's something charming about him\".[79] She later labeled Dante as the best male villain in the franchise's history, describing him as \"revenge with a smirk\".[80] After being cast, Momoa was initially apprehensive over filming conditions due to reports of conflict on set between Diesel and Lin,[81] and said he accepted the role to play against type.[82] In May, Rita Moreno was cast as Abuelita, the grandmother of Dom, Jakob, and Mia,[21] with Leterrier describing her inclusion as the \"guiding light that Dom is following\", adding, \"[Abuelita] is his conscience, [she is one] of the people that keep him grounded. When your grandmother you haven't seen for years gives you a message that becomes guiding for the second part of your life, you listen\".[30] In a February 2023 interview with *Collider*, Moreno's grandson said he pitched for her inclusion in *Fast X* after he met Diesel at the premiere for *West Side Story* (2021), which starred Moreno.[83]\n\n\nOn December 23, 2022, it was revealed that Gal Gadot, who portrayed Gisele Yashar in three previous installments, filmed a scene for *Fast X*; according to social media reports, she appeared in one of two versions of the film screened three days prior, with further details about the nature of her return undisclosed.[84] Gadot's potential return was met with mixed reception by fans and critics; some criticized the franchise's history of reviving dead characters to capitalize on star power, labeling it \"ineffective\" fan service which negatively impacts the previous installments and the story of the franchise.[85][86][87] Others were positive about Gadot's potential return, citing her portrayal of one of the franchise's most popular characters.[88] In a February 2023 interview with *ComicBook*, Sung Kang refused to rule out Gadot's character being resurrected in *Fast X*.[89] As the final cast rounded out, it sparked debate that it could create a story problem for the film; writing for *Screen Rant*, Ryan Northrup said, \"With such a large cast, it's uncertain whether *Fast X* will be able to serve [every] character in a satisfying way. With many new and returning characters, [every] arc may not be as fleshed out [and if] new characters aren't given much screen time or development, [it will be] a disappointment. [It may be] up to the finale to rectify [it]\".[90]\n\n\nA month later, a leaked email from *The Hollywood Reporter* revealed some crew returned after principal photography had completed to film a \"button or tag\" (a mid or post-credits scene) that will feature \"a guest cameo\".[91] Gadot and Johnson ultimately reprised their roles in cameo appearances.[31] Rodriguez and Diesel later said Gadot's return had been planned for previous installments (going as far as to film unused cameos), with Diesel reasoning the decision to include Gadot in *Fast X* was done because it \"fit the [film]\". He also said, \"Doing tags is tricky because you want great talent but at the same time you have to be very careful to maintain the emotional state of your audience\".[92] Several actors who were reported to be reprising their roles from previous films in *Fast X* did not end up doing so, including Michael Rooker as Buddy,[6][93] Cardi B as Leysa,[94] Don Omar as Rico Santos, and Tego Calder\u00f3n as Tego Leo, respectively.[95]\n\n\nFollowing the release of the film's trailer on February 9, 2023, Leterrier hinted archival footage featuring Paul Walker from previous films may be used in *Fast X*, saying, \"Brian is very much alive in [this franchise]. This [film] jumps back and forth between the past and the present. You will see Brian in the past, you won't see Brian in the present. [His] family is part of this franchise. It has to be the right moment, the right tone [if] Brian has to re-enter the franchise. [It must be] as perfect as how he left\".[96] Regarding Walker's inclusion, Rodriguez said, \"It's really hard to [make the films] without a blessing of some sort from [his] family because it's everything. Without that kind of like that love from them, we would be lost\". She also revealed *Furious 7* (2015) is her favorite film in the franchise, citing its emotional tribute to Walker.[97] Diesel similarly commented on Walker's potential inclusion in the film in a March 2023 interview with *Total Film*, saying, \"[Universal] made a bold, righteous, and daring decision to keep Brian O'Conner alive. I couldn't image this saga ending without truly saying goodbye to Brian\".[57]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\nPrincipal photography began on April 21, 2022, with the film's title being revealed and Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges, Jordana Brewster, Nathalie Emmanuel, Sung Kang, and Charlize Theron confirmed to reprise their roles.[6][9] According to Diesel, an earlier draft excluded Brewster's character, which he overturned. *Fast X*'s production budget was initially reported to be $300\u00a0million in May 2022, which was revised to $340\u00a0million that November; the cast was reportedly paid $100\u00a0million for their involvement,[98] including $20\u00a0million for Diesel.[99] Other costs for the rising budget (which factors in tax-incentive offsets) included increases in production costs caused by global inflation and charges for pandemic testing requirements mandated by COVID-19 safety protocols.[100] According to unnamed sources reporting to *Radar*, Diesel reportedly \"stressed\" over the increased budget and the creative decisions in *Fast X*; sources wrote Diesel is considered by Universal as \"simultaneously the greatest star [they've] had and their biggest headache\" and that \"[Diesel] doesn't let anybody forget [how] the *Fast & Furious* franchise is important to the whole [film] industry\".[101]\n\n\nA week after filming commenced, Lin exited the film as director due to \"creative differences\", leaving primary production stalled. However, Lin remained on board as a producer.[102] Later reports alleged that Lin clashed on set with Diesel, who purportedly arrived out of shape, was often late, and did not remember his lines.[103] Lin was also upset with rewrites to his screenplay, as well as changing filming locations and one of the film's villains having yet to be cast;[98] a disagreement with Diesel reportedly escalated to the point it caused Lin to shout, \"This movie is not worth my mental health\";[104] Lin reportedly forewent pay in the region of $10\u201320\u00a0million in his departure.[105] Second unit production remained ongoing in the United Kingdom while the studio sought a replacement director.[106] Universal Pictures reportedly spent $1\u00a0million a day to pause production.[107] Former *Fast & Furious* directors F. Gary Gray and David Leitch, who previously directed *The Fate of the Furious* and *Hobbs & Shaw* respectively, were considered by the studio to replace Lin, however neither were likely to step in due to their commitments with *Lift* and *The Fall Guy* (both 2024), respectively.[108][109] *Furious 7* director James Wan, who was once considered to direct *The Fate of the Furious* and *F9* but declined due to his straining experience on *Furious 7*, was also considered a \"viable option\" but was tied with commitments to *Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom* (2023), the final DC Extended Universe (DCEU) film.[109][110] *Variety* reported hiring an \"A-list\" director was not probable without drastic changes to the screenplay and Universal would likely turn to a second unit director \"well-versed\" in big-budget action films.[109] On May 2, 2022, Louis Leterrier was announced as Lin's replacement.[111]\n\n\n\n![](image)Louis Leterrier replaced Lin as director a week after filming began.\nLeterrier already had an established relationship with the studio, having previously directed the MCU film *The Incredible Hulk* (2008), and he was knowledgeable about the franchise;[112] he and franchise star Jason Statham went to watch the original film in Paris in 2001 while on a break from filming *The Transporter* (2002).[113] Leterrier joined filming in London after scheduling and contractual considerations were confirmed;[114][115] he later revealed he initially rejected the offer to direct the film, labeling it a \"massive\" task,[54] although later used elements of Lin's original contributions, such as the established crew, as well as Lin's shot lists and storyboards, to complete the film.[105] Production in London concluded in mid-August, with scenes filmed at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden.[116] Rodriguez later revealed a fight sequence between her and Theron was shot without a principal director, being done while studio negotiations with Leterrier were ongoing.[58] Ritchson initially thought he would lose the role of Aimes upon being informed by producer Jeff Kirschenbaum about the directing change, but was quickly reassured by Kirschenbaum that he was still cast and that he would just not collaborate with Lin.[74] Describing his style for the film, Leterrier said, \"I'm more practical than other directors, and I brought [the franchise] back to earth\", revealing he favored more practical stunts (including a return of racing scenes featuring a \"vertical quarter mile race\") enhanced with visual effects,[117] as opposed to the extensive use of computer-generated imagery (CGI) in the recent installments.[55][30]\n\n\nFilming took place in Genzano di Roma[118] in mid-May. Filming took place in Rome for two weeks in mid-May,[119] and one week in mid-July,[120] with scenes being shot at the Via Cristoforo Colombo, Lungotevere, Via dei Fori Imperiali, Ponte Umberto I, Ponte Vittorio Emanuele II, and the area around the Castel Sant'Angelo and the Spanish Steps.[121] Filming then took place in Turin between May 24 and June 6, with action sequences filmed at the Piazza Crimea and Corso Fiume, Murazzi del Po, Via Roma, and the Piazza IV Marzo.[122] Momoa began shooting his scenes on May 16.[119] Like previous installments, Diesel supervised writing and design of the film's action sequences; according to unnamed sources to *The Hollywood Reporter*, Diesel's creative control and frequent last-minute changes reflect \"a process [which] is like a mosaic that doesn't stop moving\", labeling him \"demanding\" and a perfectionist.[104] On June 6, it was reported a stuntman was injured in an accident after being hit by part of a car after an explosion.[123] On July 22, in an interview with *Deadline Hollywood* while at San Diego Comic-Con, Rodriguez announced she had completed filming her scenes and said \"only four [or] five weeks [are] left\" in production.[124] Filming in Angelino Heights (the location of the Toretto house) faced protest from some local residents after production gave notice of the filming of a sequence which would involve \"simulated emergency services activity, aerial photography, wetting down of street and atmospheric smoke\". According to those residents, the protest was to raise awareness for road safety education, claiming the franchise caused their neighborhood to become a hot spot for fans to engage in street racing and other dangerous activity.[125] Filming managed to occur following the protest on August 26,[126] while other portions were filmed in Portugal, such as in Lisbon, Viseu, and Vila Real. In an interview with Lusa News Agency, Concei\u00e7\u00e3o Azevedo, the mayor of Viseu, announced filming would take place on IP5, a highway in the Vouzela municipality.[127] Ritchson finished filming his scenes by August 16,[128] and hinted at flying cars in the film, stating \"we're going to take it to the sky\".[129]\n\n\nDuring filming, Sofia Noronha, a producer for Sagesse Productions (the company in charge of overseeing production of *Fast X* in Portugal) said a \"brutal economic investment\" will be made in the country by the film. Highlighting the weather, affordability through tax breaks, and flexibility of the production, Noronha argued \"investments [from film] made in the country is almost double that tax incentive. The [producing] country always benefits\".[127] This was echoed during filming in Turin, with it reported the two-week schedule generated \u20ac3.8 million for the local economy, coming mainly from expenses related to location rent, hospitality, technical staff and local workforce employment, security and sanitation, and storage and unloading. It was also reported the film regularly brought troupes of close to 400 people (5 times above average for comparable films) and often collaborated with hundreds of local professionals on the research of locations and finalization of the working filming plan.[122] In a statement, Beatrice Borgia, President of Film Commission Torino Piemonte, said \"*Fast X* is a confirmation of the key role Turin and Piedmont has gained in filmmaking. [We have] proved to have all what is needed to host complex productions: skilled professionals, supportive institutions, and amazing locations\".[122]\n\n\n\n### Post-production[edit]\n\n\nDylan Highsmith and Kelly Matsumoto, both of whom were two of the three co-editors on *F9*, return as editors with Laura Yanovich and Corbin Mehl joining. Peter Chiang returns as the visual effects supervisor for the production, after doing so for *F9*, with DNEG and Industrial Light & Magic as the returning visual effects vendors. In a July 2022 interview with *The Hollywood Reporter*, Michelle Rodriguez praised the addition of Leterrier and his predominantly French-speaking creative team, labeling it \"the French takeover, dude\". She stated Leterrier \"came with all this energy of love [from] a real fan of [the] franchise who really wants to take it places that it hasn't gone before. It reminds you [how] beautiful and magical [filmmaking] is\".[130] Several aerial shots were filmed with first-person view (FPV) drones with an attached WarpCam\u00ae piloted by Johnny Schaer, similar to the filming techniques that were used for the action sequences in Michael Bay's *Ambulance* (2022). Schaer previously supervised the drone-led filming in Rawson Marshall Thurber's *Red Notice* (2021).[131] The filmmakers researched pre-existing and unused footage of *Fast Five* through Universal's archival department as the film had dailies for \"alternate takes and different angles\". Such footage was composited to provide changes for *Fast X*'s flashback, integrating the characters into it using motion control photography and CGI.[132] In March 2023, the writing credits were finalized; Mazeau and Lin received screenplay credits, and both shared story credits with Zach Dean.[133] In May 2023, despite his initial refusal to return to the franchise, it was announced that Dwayne Johnson would appear as Luke Hobbs in the movie's mid-credits scene.[33]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Fast X (soundtrack)\n\nThe first single for the film's soundtrack, \"Let's Ride\", was released on February 10, 2023, performed by YG, Ty Dolla Sign, and Lambo4oe. The soundtrack features hip hop, pop, reggaeton, electronic rock, and rhythmic Latin tracks. The second song from the film, \"Won't Back Down\", performed by YoungBoy Never Broke Again, Bailey Zimmerman, and Dermot Kennedy, was released on May 4. The soundtrack of the film was released on May 19, by Artist Partner Group.[134]\n\n\nIn March 2023 during post-production, Brian Tyler was returned to composed the film score after he previously scoring some of the film franchise starting with the third installment *The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift* (2006).[135] The official score album was being released on June 2, 2023, by Back Lot Music.[136]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nParts of *Fast X* previewed at CineEurope in Barcelona in June 2022, including a first look at Jason Momoa and Brie Larson. Speaking of the film, Universal Pictures International President of Distribution, Veronika Kwan Vandenberg, stated the studio's drive was to continue to \"cater to the diverse tastes\" expected from the franchise.[137] At the 2022 Grio Awards, Tyrese Gibson stated he watched the completed film on October 20, 2022, describing it as \"crazy\" with \"just too much magic\", and announced an extended version of the film's trailer would first premiere at Super Bowl LVII on February 12, 2023.[138] This was seemingly confirmed in a December 2022 social media post by Vin Diesel, who wrote the trailer was \"less than two months away\",[139] and was made it official in January 2023 post.[140] In a January 2023 report by *Collider*, it was confirmed the first trailer would debut worldwide on February 10, 2023 (after being screened at a private fan event a day prior); it was three minutes long,[141] and was followed with a Super Bowl spot alongside *Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves*, *Cocaine Bear*, *Scream VI*, *65*, *Air*, *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3* and *The Flash* (all 2023).[142][143] Beginning February 1, to promote the release of the trailer, official recuts of the trailers of each of the previous nine films, dubbed \"Legacy Trailers\", were released daily in conjunction with *IGN*.[144] The fan event took place at L.A. Live in downtown Los Angeles, being hosted by Maria Menounos and featuring Diesel, Rodriguez, Gibson, Ludacris, and Cody Walker, the brother of the series' longtime initial star Paul Walker.[145] Similar fan events also took place in Mexico, France, and Japan but did not feature the cast.[146]\n\n\nOn February 1, the film's teaser poster was released, depicting Diesel alone in the center, bowing his head and clutching a cross between his fists on a dark to light backdrop. Writing for *Collider*, Safeeyah Kazi said his positioning depicts \"an intense prayer\" with the \"small amount of light [from the cross] engulfing his fist acting as the optimism in the dark\". She also said that the relative simplicity of the poster compared to the \"color explosion\" for *F9* could indicate a grittier storyline in *Fast X*. Kazi wrote the film's \"the end of the road begins\" tagline depicted \"a new level of intensity\", and speculated it could refer to the end for some of the franchise's characters.[147] In an analysis by Matt Singer of WBUF, Singer described the poster as \"somber\", noting it as \"remarkably tense\" compared to the posters for other entries in the franchise.[148] Stills from the film detailing Momoa, Larson, and Diesel's characters were publicly released on February 9,[149] and was followed by a teaser showcasing the main cast a day later.[150] The official trailer then released soon after,[151] featuring an orchestral flip of \"Notorious Thugs\" by The Notorious B.I.G. and Bone Thugs-n-Harmony from the former's album *Life After Death* (1997).[152] The trailer was mostly positively received; writing for *GQ*, Grant Rindner labeled the trailer \"glorious absurdity\", stating it is \"as glossy and over-the-top as recent features\". He commended the return of racing scenes, saying it \"restores the original feeling\" of the films, and said the music was an \"operatic nail-biter\".[153]\n\n\nAccording to data from social media analytics company RelishMix, the film's Super Bowl trailer (dubbed \"The Big Game Trailer\") clocked 94.1\u00a0million views across social media in the 24-hour period following the game; it was the third most viewed trailer that aired at the event, behind *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3* (134.1\u00a0million views) and *The Flash* (97.4\u00a0million).[154] It was the highest-viewed trailer which did not debut at the event,[154] but its view count was down from the 110.9\u00a0million views received by *F9*'s Super Bowl trailer in 2020, prior to that film's eventual delay. According to unnamed sources reporting to *Variety*, the first trailer accumulated an estimated 295 million views globally within the first 72 hours of release;[146] Instagram drove nearly 30% of views, followed by TikTok (25%), Facebook (22%), YouTube (18%) and Twitter (6%), with a majority of viewership coming in from international territories. *Fast X* also trended as the top topic on Twitter in the U.S. immediately after the trailer debut.[146] Similar to other *Fast & Furious* releases, Hot Wheels announced a themed basic assortment of cars set to feature in *Fast X*, which is set to be released with the film.[155]\n\n\nOn March 14, 2023, the official theatrical poster was released; writing for *Collider*, Aidan King positively reviewed the poster, saying the vehicles placed around the characters are similar to a \"high-octane drag race\", indicating a return to the franchise's history as car-oriented films. He also noted the characters \"loom above the drag [race] scene\", referencing the franchise's thematic shift away from car culture.[156] Two featurettes were released, first on March 31 and then on April 7, 2023, with the main cast giving a behind-the-scenes look (with previously unseen footage) at the production of the film.[157][158] An additional featurette highlighting Diesel and Perry's characters was released on May 5, with the pair and Leterrier providing commentary.[159]\n\n\nOn April 19, the second full-length trailer and the film's official synopsis was released; it was generally praised by critics for its action and Momoa's presentation.[160] On May 2, a character trailer featuring Diesel and Rodriguez, titled \"Fast X: Open Road\", was released; writing for */Film*, Bill Bria described it as \"reflective\". The trailer featured elements of Max Richter's \"On the Nature of Daylight\" and Dinah Washington's contributions from \"This Bitter Earth\", which Bria said \"lent even more gravitas to the Dom/Letty highlight reel\". He further praised the combination, stating \"visuals so nakedly frivolous and music so achingly earnest\" created \"an exquisite tension\".[161] Two days later, the free to play 8-bit style game *Fast X: Let's Race* was launched online. The game features multiple top-down race courses set in the film's locations of Los Angeles, Rio de Janeiro, and Rome.[162] Diesel and Rodriguez then appeared in promotional spots at the 2023 Miami Grand Prix,[163] while in the United Kingdom, the film partnered with the Capital radio network to launch a competition for a listener to win a trip to Rome.[164] The extended four and a half-minute final trailer was released on May 15.[165]\n\n\nOn May 16, Philips announced a partnership with Universal Pictures in the Philippines, where one could win tickets alongside purchases of an Evnia gaming monitor.[166] Universal also partnered with Frito-Lay's Ruffles to create limited-edition *Fast X* potato chips, which come with raffle tickets where fans could win a ticket; a lucky prize included the 2023 Dodge Charger R/T.[167]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\n*Fast X* premiered on May 12, 2023, at the Colosseum in Rome.[168] It was initially scheduled for release on April 2, 2021,[169] but was postponed to April 7, 2023, and finally May 19.[170] These shifts were reportedly made in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to *F9*'s eventual postponement to June 2021 that caused *Fast X* to be indefinitely delayed.[171][172] It was widely released in IMAX and other premium large formats.[173] The film was cleared for release in China on March 28, 2023, marking one of the first large American films released in the country in 2023; *Fast & Furious* films have grossed over $1.2\u00a0billion in China since the release of *Fast & Furious 6* (2013), and was one of the first countries where *F9* (2021) was released, being five weeks ahead of its domestic release.[174]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Fast X* was released by Universal Pictures Home Entertainment on premium video on demand on June 9, 2023;[175] on 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray, and DVD on August 8;[176] and on Peacock on September 15.[177] Physical copies contain an audio commentary, behind-the-scenes featurettes, a blooper reel, and two music videos.[176]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n*Fast X* has grossed $146\u00a0million in the United States and Canada, and $568.5\u00a0million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $714.4 million.[4][5] Prior to its release, *TheWrap* estimated the film would need to gross $800\u2013850\u00a0million worldwide in order to turn a profit.[178] *Variety* later reported that the film \"barely crawled into the black\" but would post a modest profit for the studio.[179]\n\n\nIn the United States and Canada, tickets went on sale at midnight on February 9, 2023, a day prior to the premiere of the trailer.[173] According to a Fandango study, which surveyed over 6,000 ticket buyers between February and March 2023, *Fast X* was revealed to be the sixth-most anticipated film of the summer.[180] In April 2023, box office projections estimated that the film would gross $65\u201375\u00a0million in its opening weekend.[181] By the week of its release, estimates had been lowered to $60\u00a0million.[182] The film made $28\u00a0million on its first day, including $7.5\u00a0million from Thursday previews. It went on to debut to $67\u00a0million from 4,046 theaters, topping the box office.[183] Writing for *TheWrap*, Jeremy Fuster predicted that *Fast X* may be less profitable than some of its predecessors, citing the film's sudden increased overall production budget (at 70% larger than *F9*) and the expected large marketing budget.[100] In its second weekend, the film made $23\u00a0million (dropping 66%), finishing second behind newcomer *The Little Mermaid*.[184] In its third weekend, *Fast X* finished in fourth place and made $9.2\u00a0million for a drop of 61%.[185]\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, tickets went on sale on May 5.[186] The film was projected to gross around $280\u00a0million worldwide in its opening weekend, including about $220\u00a0million from 84 countries.[182] Like its domestic debut, the film ended up slightly out-performing projections, making $252.7\u00a0million internationally and a total of $320\u00a0million worldwide. It was the sixth-best opening weekend for a studio film since 2019, and second-biggest non-superhero title (behind *Avatar: The Way of Water*).[187] Its largest markets were China ($78\u00a0million), Mexico ($16\u00a0million), France ($9.6\u00a0million), and Brazil ($9.6\u00a0million).[188] The film set records for the highest-opening weekend release for a foreign film in Pakistan, with 19.98 crore ($701,052).[189]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 56% of 310 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.7/10. The website's consensus reads: \"As irredeemably silly as it is satisfyingly self-aware, *Fast X* should rev the engines of longtime fans while leaving many newcomers in neutral.\"[1] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 56 out of 100, based on 59 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.[190] Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale, the same as *F9* and the first film but below other installments. PostTrak reported filmgoers gave the film an 82% positive score, with 67% saying they would definitely recommend it.[183]\n\n\nMomoa's performance was widely praised by critics; Eric Eisenberg of *CinemaBlend* said Momoa \"plays Dante like [the] *Fast & Furious* version of The Joker\", concluding it was a \"delightful\" portrayal of a \"gleeful psychopath\". Liam Crowley of *Comicbook* seconded this view, calling Momoa \"hilarious\", while *Screen Rant*'s Joseph Deckelmeier said Momoa brings \"magic\" to a performance which \"oozes charisma\".[191] In a mixed review, Brian Truitt of *USA Today* also praised Momoa's performance but criticized the screenplay, saying, \"Laws of physics are pummeled at length and all logic is shot out of a cannon [with] its bizarre character choices and decisions\".[192] The *Chicago Sun-Times*'s Richard Roeper gave the film two out of four stars and was more critical of Momoa's performance, writing, \"[He] comes across as more of a preening, performance-art, sociopathic clown than a truly menacing villain\".[193] Clarisse Loughrey of *The Independent* said that an \"arbitrary\" plot serves a \"biblically-scaled soap opera [that] happily rewrites the laws of gravity and physiology to put a smile on its audience's faces\", and praised the cast performances, namely Momoa's.[194]\n\n\nIn a less positive review, Charles Pulliam-Moore of *The Verge* criticized the return of former characters, saying the film has \"convoluted twists and turns\" which contribute to making it feel \"exciting, but airless\". He also wrote the large cast made its characters \"feel like souped-up cameos meant to remind you of the past rather than figures organically existing in the present\u2014especially when they just pop up out of nowhere, which happens more often than you'd expect\". He also criticized the screenplay, saying \"[Dom and Dante's] conflict ends up feeling like something that was mapped out on paper, but was not crafted tightly enough for on-screen\".[195] This was echoed by *Den of Geek*'s Don Kay, who lamented the lack of character beats for the supporting cast and the lack of stakes in the plot, although he praised Cena's performance, writing, \"He plays to his comedic strengths and gets by on his sheer charisma\".[196]\n\n\nAlison Willmore of *Vulture* criticized Leterrier's direction, writing the film \"plays like it was made by an AI versed in the existing [films] but not quite up to spitting out something coherent itself\" and called its plot \"deliriously unwieldy\". She also criticized its cast as being bloated and its dialogue as feeling \"engineered to be clipped and used without context for promotional purposes\", concluding watching *Fast X* \"feels like sustaining a head injury\".[197] Writing for *Slant*, Greg Nussen criticized the acting performances and cinematography, calling it \"overly lit [with] ultra-saturated images\" and wrote that the film was \"closer to fan fiction or self-parody than the real deal\".[198] Writing for *The Wall Street Journal*, Kyle Smith also criticized Leterrier's direction as overzealous, saying, \"Leterrier rarely misses an opportunity to shred the storyline [to] end up with confetti, serving ridiculous action scenes [that] require much narrative corner-cutting\".[199]\n\n\nIn a scathing review, *GameSpot*'s Phil Owen said the film possesses \"blurry backgrounds and weird close-up shots\", negatively comparing it to low-budget films, and called the editing \"distractingly frenetic\". He also said the storyline \"just rehashed plot threads and set pieces from past [films]\", criticized the ending, and called Diesel's performance a \"full-on parody of himself: [he plays] a bland character\".[200] Kevin Maher of *The Times* called the film a \"jaded and lackadaisical patch-up job\", criticizing the cast performances,[201] while *Rolling Stone*'s Chris Vognar said that the cast (besides Momoa) \"mailed [their] performances in\" and called the film uninspiring, writing, \"*Fast X* feels like it was written by a software program\".[202]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\n*Fast X* was nominated in five categories at the 2023 Golden Trailer Awards: \"Legacy Ride\" (TRANSIT) for Best Action and Best Music, \"Last Ride\" (AV Squad) for Best Summer 2023 Blockbuster Trailer, \"Clash\" (TRANSIT) for Best Sound Editing in a TV Spot (for a Feature Film), and \"Ensemble Shoot\" (AV Squad) for Best Action/Thriller TrailerByte for a Feature Film. It won Best Action TV Spot (for a Feature Film) for \"Ahead\" (AV Squad).[203][204] The film became a runner-up for Best Supporting Actor (Momoa) and received a nomination for Best Stunts at the 6th Hollywood Critics Association Midseason Film Awards.[205]\n\n\n\n## Sequels and spin-off[edit]\n\n\nAlthough *Fast X* was reported as the final installment of the franchise, Diesel unveiled two sequels to this film, depending on its performance. Leterrier considered whether the eleventh film to be the franchise's last installment or not.[206] The relative success of *Fast X* sought a sequel, scheduled for release on April 4, 2025.[177][g] Development on both sequels were suspended due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike.[210]\n\n\n\n## Explanatory notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Justin Lin, the film's original director, left production in April 2022, after a week through principal photography, due to creative differences.
