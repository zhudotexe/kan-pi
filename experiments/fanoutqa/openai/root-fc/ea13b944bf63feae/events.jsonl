(edit | history)\n\n### Blank passport pages[edit]\n\n\nMany countries require a minimum number of blank pages to be available in the passport being presented, typically one or two pages.[398] Endorsement pages, which often appear after the visa pages, are not counted as being valid or available.\n\n\n\n### Vaccination[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Vaccination requirements for international travel, International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis, and Vaccine passports during the COVID-19 pandemic\n\n![](image)Cover of the new International Certificate of Vaccination issued by the Bureau of Quarantine in the Philippines since 2021\nMany African countries, including Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Republic of the Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo, South Sudan, Uganda, and Zambia, require *all* incoming passengers older than nine months to one year[399] to have a current International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis, as does the South American territory of French Guiana.[400]\n\n\nSome other countries require vaccination only if the passenger is coming from an infected area or has visited one recently or has transited for 12 hours in those countries: Algeria, Botswana, Cabo Verde, Chad, Djibouti, Egypt, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Lesotho, Libya, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, Seychelles, Somalia, South Africa, Sudan, Tunisia, Uganda, United Republic of Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.[401][402]\n\n\n\n### Passport validity length[edit]\n\n\nVery few countries, such as Paraguay, just require a valid passport on arrival.\n\n\nHowever many countries and groupings now require only an identity card – especially from their neighbours. Other countries may have special bilateral arrangements that depart from the generality of their passport validity length policies to shorten the period of passport validity required for each other's citizens[403][404] or even accept passports that have already expired (but *not* been cancelled).[405]\n\n\nSome countries, such as Japan,[406] Ireland and the United Kingdom,[407] require a passport valid throughout the period of the intended stay. \n\n\nIn the absence of specific bilateral agreements, countries requiring passports to be valid for at least 6 more months on arrival include Afghanistan, Algeria, Anguilla, Bahrain,[408] Bhutan, Botswana, British Virgin Islands, Brunei, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Cayman Islands, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Costa Rica, Côte d'Ivoire, Curaçao, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Equatorial Guinea, Fiji, Gabon, Guinea Bissau, Guyana, Haiti, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Israel,[409] Jordan, Kenya, Kiribati, Kuwait, Laos, Madagascar, Malaysia, Marshall Islands, Mongolia, Myanmar, Namibia, Nepal, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Oman, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Peru,[410] Philippines,[411] Qatar, Rwanda, Samoa, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Solomon Islands, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Suriname, Tanzania, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Tokelau, Tonga, Turkey, Tuvalu, Uganda, United Arab Emirates, Vanuatu, Venezuela, and Vietnam.[412]\n\n\nCountries requiring passports valid for at least 4 months on arrival include Micronesia and Zambia.\n\n\nCountries requiring passports with a validity of at least 3 months beyond the date of intended departure include Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Honduras, Montenegro, Nauru, Moldova and New Zealand.\nSimilarly, the EEA countries of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, all European Union countries (except Ireland) together with Switzerland also require 3 months validity beyond the date of the bearer's intended departure unless the bearer is an EEA or Swiss national.\n\n\nCountries requiring passports valid for at least 3 months on arrival include Albania, North Macedonia, Panama, and Senegal.\n\n\nBermuda requires passports to be valid for at least 45 days upon entry.\n\n\nCountries that require a passport validity of at least one month beyond the date of intended departure include Eritrea, Hong Kong, Lebanon, Macau, the Maldives[413] and South Africa.\n\n\n\n### Criminal record[edit]\n\n\nSome countries, including Australia, Canada, Fiji, New Zealand and the United States,[414] routinely deny entry to non-citizens who have a criminal record while others impose restrictions depending on the type of conviction and the length of the sentence.\n\n\n\n### *Persona non grata*[edit]\n\n\nThe government of a country can declare a diplomat *persona non grata*, banning entry into that country. In non-diplomatic use, the authorities of a country may also declare a foreigner *persona non grata* permanently or temporarily, usually because of unlawful activity.[415]\n\n\n\n### Israeli stamps[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Israeli border control Entry Permit (issued as a stand-alone document rather than a stamp affixed in a passport)\nKuwait,[416] Lebanon,[417] Libya,[418] Syria,[419] and Yemen[420] do not allow entry to people with passport stamps from Israel or whose passports have either a used or an unused Israeli visa, or where there is evidence of previous travel to Israel such as entry or exit stamps from neighbouring border posts in transit countries such as Jordan and Egypt. \n\n\nTo circumvent this Arab League boycott of Israel, the Israeli immigration services have now mostly ceased to stamp foreign nationals' passports on either entry to or exit from Israel (unless the entry is for some work-related purposes). Since 15 January 2013, Israel no longer stamps foreign passports at Ben Gurion Airport. Passports are still (as of 22 June 2017[update]) stamped at Erez when passing into and out of Gaza.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIran refuses admission to holders of passports containing an Israeli visa or stamp that is less than 12 months old.\n\n\n\n### Biometrics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Countries applying biometrics\n\nSeveral countries mandate that all travellers, or all foreign travellers, be fingerprinted on arrival and will refuse admission to or even arrest travellers who refuse to comply. In some countries, such as the United States, this may apply even to transit passengers who merely wish to change planes rather than go landside.[421]\n\n\nFingerprinting countries/regions include Afghanistan,[422][423] Argentina,[424] Brunei, Cambodia,[425] China,[426] Ethiopia,[427] Ghana, Guinea,[428] India, Japan,[429][430] Kenya (both fingerprints and a photo are taken),[431] Malaysia upon entry and departure,[432] Mongolia, Saudi Arabia,[433] Singapore, South Korea,[434] Taiwan, Thailand,[435] Uganda,[436] the United Arab Emirates and the United States.\n\n\nMany countries also require a photo be taken of people entering the country. The United States, which does not fully implement exit control formalities at its land frontiers (although long mandated by domestic legislation),[437][438][439] intends to implement facial recognition for passengers departing from international airports to identify people who overstay their visa.[440]\n\n\nTogether with fingerprint and face recognition, iris scanning is one of three biometric identification technologies internationally standardised since 2006 by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) for use in e-passports[441] and the United Arab Emirates conducts iris scanning on visitors who need to apply for a visa.[442][443] The United States Department of Homeland Security has announced plans to greatly increase the biometric data it collects at US borders.[444] In 2018, Singapore began trials of iris scanning at three land and maritime immigration checkpoints.[445][446]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Japan portal\n\n\n* Visa policy of Japan\n* Japanese passport\n* Visa requirements for United States citizens\n\n\n## References and Notes[edit]\n\n\nReferences\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Major Shake-Up in World's Passport Power Ranking\". *Henley & Partners*.

Many reasons for the long gestating development have been documented in BPC's 2014 report Entry-Exit System: Progress, Challenges, and Outlook, including the technological, operational, and cost challenges of creating exit systems and infrastructure where none exist today. However, many critics, especially in Congress, simply accused the Department of Homeland security of dragging its feet... the major operational, logistical, and technical challenge in implementing exit capability at our ports has been the land borders. Unlike airports and seaports, the land border environment is not physically controlled, there is no means to get advance information on who is arriving, and the sheer volume of travel—both vehicular and pedestrian—creates challenges in any system to not further exacerbate delays. While biometric exit for land vehicular traffic is still in the \"what if\" stage, CBP is moving ahead and piloting systems and technology to use with the large population of pedestrian crossers at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n438. **^** Lipton, Eric (21 May 2013). \"U.S. Quietly Monitors Foreigners' Departures at the Canadian Border\". *The New York Times*.

(edit | history)\n\n\n\n\nMany countries have **entry restrictions on foreigners** that go beyond the common requirement of having either a valid visa or a visa exemption. Such restrictions may be health related or impose additional documentation requirements on certain classes of people for diplomatic or political purposes.\n\n\n\n### Blank passport pages[edit]\n\n\nMany countries require a minimum number of blank pages to be available in the passport being presented, typically one or two pages.[390] Endorsement pages, which often appear after the visa pages, are not counted as being valid or available.\n\n\n\n### Vaccination[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Vaccination requirements for international travel, International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis, and Vaccine passports during the COVID-19 pandemic\n\n![](image)Cover of the new International Certificate of Vaccination issued by the Bureau of Quarantine in the Philippines since 2021\nMany African countries, including Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Republic of the Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo, South Sudan, Uganda, and Zambia, require *all* incoming passengers older than nine months to one year[391] to have a current International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis, as does the South American territory of French Guiana.[392]\n\n\nSome other countries require vaccination only if the passenger is coming from an infected area or has visited one recently or has transited for 12 hours in those countries: Algeria, Botswana, Cabo Verde, Chad, Djibouti, Egypt, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Lesotho, Libya, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, Seychelles, Somalia, South Africa, Sudan, Tunisia, Uganda, United Republic of Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.[393][394]\n\n\n\n### Passport validity length[edit]\n\n\nVery few countries, such as Paraguay, just require a valid passport on arrival.\n\n\nHowever many countries and groupings now require only an identity card – especially from their neighbours. Other countries may have special bilateral arrangements that depart from the generality of their passport validity length policies to shorten the period of passport validity required for each other's citizens[395][396] or even accept passports that have already expired (but *not* been cancelled).[397]\n\n\nSome countries, such as Japan,[398] Ireland and the United Kingdom,[399] require a passport valid throughout the period of the intended stay. \n\n\nIn the absence of specific bilateral agreements, countries requiring passports to be valid for at least 6 more months on arrival include Afghanistan, Algeria, Anguilla, Bahrain,[400] Bhutan, Botswana, British Virgin Islands, Brunei, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Cayman Islands, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Costa Rica, Côte d'Ivoire, Curaçao, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Equatorial Guinea, Fiji, Gabon, Guinea Bissau, Guyana, Haiti, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Israel,[401] Jordan, Kenya, Kiribati, Kuwait, Laos, Madagascar, Malaysia, Marshall Islands, Mongolia, Myanmar, Namibia, Nepal, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Oman, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Peru,[402] Philippines,[403] Qatar, Rwanda, Samoa, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Solomon Islands, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Suriname, Tanzania, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Tokelau, Tonga, Turkey, Tuvalu, Uganda, United Arab Emirates, Vanuatu, Venezuela, and Vietnam.[404]\n\n\nCountries requiring passports valid for at least 4 months on arrival include Micronesia and Zambia.\n\n\nCountries requiring passports with a validity of at least 3 months beyond the date of intended departure include Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Honduras, Montenegro, Nauru, Moldova and New Zealand.\nSimilarly, the EEA countries of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, all European Union countries (except Ireland) together with Switzerland also require 3 months validity beyond the date of the bearer's intended departure unless the bearer is an EEA or Swiss national.\n\n\nCountries requiring passports valid for at least 3 months on arrival include Albania, North Macedonia, Panama, and Senegal.\n\n\nBermuda requires passports to be valid for at least 45 days upon entry.\n\n\nCountries that require a passport validity of at least one month beyond the date of intended departure include Eritrea, Hong Kong, Lebanon, Macau, the Maldives[405] and South Africa.\n\n\n\n### Criminal record[edit]\n\n\nSome countries, including Australia, Canada, Fiji, New Zealand and the United States,[406] routinely deny entry to non-citizens who have a criminal record while others impose restrictions depending on the type of conviction and the length of the sentence.\n\n\n\n### *Persona non grata*[edit]\n\n\nThe government of a country can declare a diplomat *persona non grata*, banning entry into that country. In non-diplomatic use, the authorities of a country may also declare a foreigner *persona non grata* permanently or temporarily, usually because of unlawful activity.[407]\n\n\n\n### Israeli stamps[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Israeli border control Entry Permit (issued as a stand-alone document rather than a stamp affixed in a passport)\nKuwait,[408] Lebanon,[409] Libya,[410] Syria,[411] and Yemen[412] do not allow entry to people with passport stamps from Israel or whose passports have either a used or an unused Israeli visa, or where there is evidence of previous travel to Israel such as entry or exit stamps from neighbouring border posts in transit countries such as Jordan and Egypt. \n\n\nTo circumvent this Arab League boycott of Israel, the Israeli immigration services have now mostly ceased to stamp foreign nationals' passports on either entry to or exit from Israel (unless the entry is for some work-related purposes). Since 15 January 2013, Israel no longer stamps foreign passports at Ben Gurion Airport. Passports are still (as of 22 June 2017[update]) stamped at Erez when passing into and out of Gaza.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIran refuses admission to holders of passports containing an Israeli visa or stamp that is less than 12 months old.\n\n\n\n### Biometrics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Countries applying biometrics\n\nSeveral countries mandate that all travellers, or all foreign travellers, be fingerprinted on arrival and will refuse admission to or even arrest travellers who refuse to comply. In some countries, such as the United States, this may apply even to transit passengers who merely wish to change planes rather than go landside.[413]\n\n\nFingerprinting countries/regions include Afghanistan,[414][415] Argentina,[416] Brunei, Cambodia,[417] China,[418] Ethiopia,[419] Ghana, Guinea,[420] India, Japan,[421][422] Kenya (both fingerprints and a photo are taken),[423] Malaysia upon entry and departure,[424] Mongolia, Saudi Arabia,[425] Singapore, South Korea,[426] Taiwan, Thailand,[427] Uganda,[428] the United Arab Emirates and the United States.\n\n\nMany countries also require a photo be taken of people entering the country. The United States, which does not fully implement exit control formalities at its land frontiers (although long mandated by domestic legislation),[429][430][431] intends to implement facial recognition for passengers departing from international airports to identify people who overstay their visa.[432]\n\n\nTogether with fingerprint and face recognition, iris scanning is one of three biometric identification technologies internationally standardised since 2006 by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) for use in e-passports[433] and the United Arab Emirates conducts iris scanning on visitors who need to apply for a visa.[434][435]\n\n\n\n## Consular protection abroad[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of diplomatic missions of South Korea\n\n![](image)South Korean diplomatic missions throughout the world\n\nThe Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea each set the territorial scope in **their respective constitutions** to cover **the entire Korean Peninsula**. So the two Koreas regard each other's territory as part of their own territory and do not recognize the sovereignty of the other side as a country. For this reason, embassies based on the premise of establishing diplomatic relations between **foreign countries** cannot be mutually established. Inter-Korean exchange relations are not under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of each government, but the Ministry of Unification on the South Korean side and the Workers' Party of Korea on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea side.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)South Korea portal\n\n\n* List of nationalities forbidden at border\n* Republic of Korea passport\n* Visa policy of South Korea\n\n\n## References and notes[edit]\n\n\n### Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** South Korean citizens are currently prohibited from entering Ukraine due to the ongoing Russian invasion.\n\n1. **^** * Ahmedabad\n\t* Amritsar\n\t* Bagdogra\n\t* Bengaluru\n\t* Chandigarh\n\t* Chennai\n\t* Coimbatore\n\t* Delhi\n\t* Gaya\n\t* Goa\n\t* Guwahati\n\t* Hyderabad\n\t* Jaipur\n\t* Kochi\n\t* Kolkata\n\t* Kozhikode\n\t* Lucknow\n\t* Madurai\n\t* Mangaluru\n\t* Mumbai\n\t* Nagpur\n\t* Pune\n\t* Thiruvananthapuram\n\t* Tiruchirappalli\n\t* Varanasi\n\t* Visakhapatnam\n2. **^** * Cochin\n\t* Goa\n\t* Mangalore\n\n### References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"The *Henley Passport Index*\" (PDF).

While a requirement for a biometric entry-exit system has been in law for over a decade, it is not yet a reality. Many reasons for the long gestating development have been documented in BPC's 2014 report Entry-Exit System: Progress, Challenges, and Outlook, including the technological, operational, and cost challenges of creating exit systems and infrastructure where none exist today. However, many critics, especially in Congress, simply accused the Department of Homeland security of dragging its feet... the major operational, logistical, and technical challenge in implementing exit capability at our ports has been the land borders. Unlike airports and seaports, the land border environment is not physically controlled, there is no means to get advance information on who is arriving, and the sheer volume of travel—both vehicular and pedestrian—creates challenges in any system to not further exacerbate delays. While biometric exit for land vehicular traffic is still in the \"what if\" stage, CBP is moving ahead and piloting systems and technology to use with the large population of pedestrian crossers at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n430. **^** Lipton, Eric (21 May 2013). \"U.S. Quietly Monitors Foreigners' Departures at the Canadian Border\". *The New York Times*.

***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** ***n*** Also required for travellers having transited any time through a risk country's airport.\n |\n\n\n\n### COVID-19 vaccination[edit]\n\n\nMany countries increasingly consider the vaccination status of travellers with regard to quarantine requirements or when deciding to allow them entry at all.[338] This is justified by research that shows that the Pfizer vaccine effect lasts for six months or so.[339]\n\n\n\n## Passport requirements[edit]\n\n\n### Passport not required[edit]\n\n\nGerman identity card is valid for these countries:\n\n\n\n* ![](image) EU and Europe (including Gibraltar and except Belarus, Russia, the United Kingdom [for tourism] and Ukraine)[340][171]\n* ![](image) Egypt (passport type photo is required on arrival)[55]\n* ![France](image) French overseas territories (passport needed if the direct flight has a scheduled intermediate landing in a country that requires a passport)[190]\n* ![](image) Georgia[63]\n* ![](image) Turkey[146]\n* ![](image) United Kingdom (individuals with pre-settled or settled status,[171] frontier-worker permit or are a Swiss service provider can continue using national identity cards[*citation needed*])\n\n\n### Blank passport pages[edit]\n\n\nMany countries require a minimum number of blank pages to be available in the passport being presented, typically one or two pages.[341] Endorsement pages, which often appear after the visa pages, are not counted as being valid or available.\n\n\n\n### Passport validity length[edit]\n\n\nMany countries require passports to be valid for at least 6 months upon arrival and one or two blank pages.[342]\n\n\nCountries requiring passports to be validity at least 6 months on arrival include Afghanistan, Algeria, Bhutan, Botswana, Brunei, Cambodia, Comoros, Côte d'Ivoire, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Fiji, Guyana, Haiti, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq (except when arriving at Basra – 3 months and Erbil or Sulaimaniyah – on arrival), Jordan, Kenya, Kuwait, Laos, Madagascar, Malaysia, Marshall Islands, Mauritania, Mongolia, Myanmar, Namibia, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Oman, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Rwanda, Samoa, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, Suriname, Syria, Taiwan, Tanzania, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Tuvalu, Uganda, United Arab Emirates, Vanuatu, Venezuela, Vietnam, Yemen.\n\n\nTurkey usually requires passports to be valid for at least 5 months (150 days) upon entry, but for German citizens Turkish authorities allow to enter even with passport or identity card expired within last year.[343]\n\n\nCountries requiring passport validity of at least 4 months on arrival include Azerbaijan, Micronesia, Zambia.\n\n\nCountries requiring passport validity of at least 3 months on arrival include Albania, Bosnia and Herzegowina, Honduras, Moldova, Nauru, North Macedonia, Panama, Qatar and Senegal\n\n\nCountries requiring passport validity of at least 1 month on arrival include Eritrea, Hong Kong, Lebanon, Macao, Maldives, New Zealand, South Africa.\n\n\nOther countries require either a passport valid on arrival or passport valid throughout the period of intended stay.\n\n\n\n### Medical passport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis\n\nMany African countries, including Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Republic of the Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Liberia, Niger, Rwanda, Sierra Leone and Togo, require *all* incoming passengers older than nine months to one year[344] to have a current International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis, as does the South American territory of French Guiana.[345]\n\n\n\n## Entry bans[edit]\n\n\n### Criminal record[edit]\n\n\nSome countries, including Australia, Canada, Fiji, New Zealand and the United States,[346] routinely deny entry to non-citizens who have a criminal record while others impose restrictions depending on the type of conviction and the length of the sentence.\n\n\n\n### *Persona non grata*[edit]\n\n\nThe government of a country can declare a diplomat *persona non grata*, banning entry into that country. In non-diplomatic use, the authorities of a country may also declare a foreigner *persona non grata* permanently or temporarily, usually because of unlawful activity.[347]\n\n\n\n### Israeli stamps[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Israeli border control Entry Permit (issued as a stand-alone document rather than a stamp affixed in a passport)\nKuwait,[348] Lebanon,[349] Libya,[350] Syria,[351] and Yemen[352] do not allow entry to people with passport stamps from Israel or whose passports have either a used or an unused Israeli visa, or where there is evidence of previous travel to Israel such as entry or exit stamps from neighbouring border posts in transit countries such as Jordan and Egypt. \n\n\nTo circumvent this Arab League boycott of Israel, the Israeli immigration services have now mostly ceased to stamp foreign nationals' passports on either entry to or exit from Israel (unless the entry is for some work-related purposes). Since 15 January 2013, Israel no longer stamps foreign passports at Ben Gurion Airport. Passports are still (as of 22 June 2017[update]) stamped at Erez when passing into and out of Gaza.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIran refuses admission to holders of passports containing an Israeli visa or stamp that is less than 12 months old.\n\n\n\n## Biometrics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Countries applying biometrics\n\nSeveral countries mandate that all travellers, or all foreign travellers, be fingerprinted on arrival and will refuse admission to or even arrest travellers who refuse to comply. In some countries, such as the United States, this may apply even to transit passengers who merely wish to change planes rather than go landside.[353]\n\n\nFingerprinting countries/regions include Afghanistan,[354][355] Argentina,[356] Brunei, Cambodia,[357] China,[358] Ethiopia,[359] Ghana, Guinea,[360] India, Japan,[361][362] Kenya (both fingerprints and a photo are taken),[363] Malaysia upon entry and departure,[364] Mongolia, Saudi Arabia,[365] Singapore, South Korea,[366] Taiwan, Thailand,[367] Uganda,[368] the United Arab Emirates and the United States.\n\n\nMany countries also require a photo be taken of people entering the country. The United States, which does not fully implement exit control formalities at its land frontiers (although long mandated by domestic legislation),[369][370][371] intends to implement facial recognition for passengers departing from international airports to identify people who overstay their visa.[372]\n\n\nTogether with fingerprint and face recognition, iris scanning is one of three biometric identification technologies internationally standardised since 2006 by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) for use in e-passports[373] and the United Arab Emirates conducts iris scanning on visitors who need to apply for a visa.[374][375] The United States Department of Homeland Security has announced plans to greatly increase the biometric data it collects at US borders.[376] In 2018, Singapore began trials of iris scanning at three land and maritime immigration checkpoints.[377][378]\n\n\n\n## Right to consular protection in non-EU countries[edit]\n\n\nIn a non-EU country where there is no German embassy, German citizens, like all other EU citizens, have the right to get consular protection from the embassy of any other EU country present in that country.\n\n\n\n![](image)Diplomatic missions of Germany\nSee also List of diplomatic missions of Germany.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Germany portal\n* ![flag](image)European Union portal\n\n\n* Visa policy of the Schengen Area\n* German identity card\n* German passport\n\n\n## Annotations, References and Notes[edit]\n\n\n### References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"The *Henley Passport Index*\" (PDF).

While a requirement for a biometric entry-exit system has been in law for over a decade, it is not yet a reality. Many reasons for the long gestating development have been documented in BPC's 2014 report Entry-Exit System: Progress, Challenges, and Outlook, including the technological, operational, and cost challenges of creating exit systems and infrastructure where none exist today. However, many critics, especially in Congress, simply accused the Department of Homeland security of dragging its feet... the major operational, logistical, and technical challenge in implementing exit capability at our ports has been the land borders. Unlike airports and seaports, the land border environment is not physically controlled, there is no means to get advance information on who is arriving, and the sheer volume of travel—both vehicular and pedestrian—creates challenges in any system to not further exacerbate delays. While biometric exit for land vehicular traffic is still in the \"what if\" stage, CBP is moving ahead and piloting systems and technology to use with the large population of pedestrian crossers at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n370. **^** Lipton, Eric (21 May 2013). \"U.S. Quietly Monitors Foreigners' Departures at the Canadian Border\". *The New York Times*.

(edit | history)\n![](image)Israeli border control Entry Permit (issued as a stand-alone document rather than a stamp affixed in a passport)\nKuwait,[394] Lebanon,[395] Libya,[396] Syria,[397] and Yemen[398] do not allow entry to people with passport stamps from Israel or whose passports have either a used or an unused Israeli visa, or where there is evidence of previous travel to Israel such as entry or exit stamps from neighbouring border posts in transit countries such as Jordan and Egypt. \n\n\nTo circumvent this Arab League boycott of Israel, the Israeli immigration services have now mostly ceased to stamp foreign nationals' passports on either entry to or exit from Israel (unless the entry is for some work-related purposes). Since 15 January 2013, Israel no longer stamps foreign passports at Ben Gurion Airport. Passports are still (as of 22 June 2017[update]) stamped at Erez when passing into and out of Gaza.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIran refuses admission to holders of passports containing an Israeli visa or stamp that is less than 12 months old.\n\n\n\n## Fingerprinting[edit]\n\n\nSeveral countries including Argentina, Cambodia, Colombia, Japan, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and the United States demand all passengers to be fingerprinted on arrival.[399][400][401][402][403][404][405]\n\n\n\n## Right to consular protection in non-EU countries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Diplomatic missions of Spain\nIn a non-EU country where there is no Spanish embassy, Spanish citizens, like all other EU citizens, have the right to get consular protection from the embassy of any other EU country present in that country.\n\n\nSee also List of diplomatic missions of Spain.\n\n\n\n## Passport validity[edit]\n\n\nMany countries require passports to be valid for at least 6 months upon arrival and one or two blank pages.[406]\n\n\nCountries requiring passports to be validity at least 6 months on arrival include Afghanistan, Algeria, Bhutan, Botswana, Brunei, Cambodia, Comoros, Côte d'Ivoire, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Fiji, Guyana, Haiti, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq (except when arriving at Basra – 3 months and Erbil or Sulaimaniyah – on arrival), Jordan, Kenya, Kuwait, Laos, Madagascar, Malaysia, Marshall Islands, Mauritania, Mongolia, Myanmar, Namibia, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Oman, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Rwanda, Samoa, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, Suriname, Syria, Taiwan, Tanzania, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Tuvalu, Uganda, United Arab Emirates, Vanuatu, Venezuela, Vietnam, Yemen.\n\n\nTurkey usually requires passports to be valid for at least 5 months (150 days) upon entry, but for Spanish citizens Turkish authorities allow to enter even with passport expired within last 5 years.[407]\n\n\nCountries requiring passport validity of at least 4 months on arrival include Azerbaijan, Micronesia, Zambia.\n\n\nCountries requiring passport validity of at least 3 months on arrival include Albania, Bosnia and Herzegowina, Honduras, Moldova, Nauru, North Macedonia, Panama, Qatar and Senegal\n\n\nCountries requiring passport validity of at least 1 month on arrival include Eritrea, Hong Kong, Lebanon, Macao, Maldives, New Zealand, South Africa.[408]\n\n\nOther countries require either a passport valid on arrival or passport valid throughout the period of intended stay.\n\n\n\n## Non-ordinary passports[edit]\n\n\nHolders of various categories of official Spanish passports have additional visa-free access to the following countries – **Algeria** (diplomatic or service passports), **Egypt** (diplomatic, official, service or special passports), **Kazakhstan** (diplomatic passports), **Kuwait** (diplomatic passports), **Russia** (diplomatic passports), **Turkey** (diplomatic, official, service or special passports) and **Vietnam** (diplomatic passports).

From 2018 to 2022, it was the world's most powerful passport.[8] As of July 2023 however, it is ranked as the third most powerful passport, with holders able to travel visa-free to 189 countries and territories.[9]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nThe first travel documents for overseas travel by Japanese citizens were introduced in 1866, near the end of the Tokugawa shogunate. These documents took the form of a stamped \"letter of request\" allowing Japanese citizens to travel overseas for business and educational purposes. The first person to be issued with a Japanese travel document was the acrobat and magician Namigorō Sumidagawa (ja:隅田川浪五郎), who received his travel document on 17 October 1866 in order to perform at the 1867 World's Fair held in Paris, France. The term \"passport\" was formally introduced into the Japanese language in 1878, and in 1900 the first regulations governing the usage of Japanese passports were introduced. The modern form of the Japanese passport first came about in 1926, and the first ICAO-compliant, machine-readable Japanese passports were introduced in 1992.[1]\n\n\nAs of 2023, Japan is the only democracy in the world where the government arbitrarily could deny the issue of a travel document to its own citizens even if the citizen had not been convicted of any crime. [10]\n[11]\n[12]\n\n\n\n## Types of passports[edit]\n\n\n* **Ordinary passport**: Issued to normal Japanese citizens.\n\t+ Ordinary passports are issued in two different lengths of validity: 5 and 10 years. Japanese citizens up to 16 years of age can only be issued a 5 years passport, while those who are 17 years of age or older can choose either a 5 years (blue) or 10 years (red) passport for different registration fees.\n* **Official passport**: Issued to members of the National Diet and public servants.\n* **Diplomatic passport**: Issued to members of the Imperial Family, diplomats and their family members, and high-level government officials.\n\t+ By convention, the Emperor and Empress of Japan do not hold a passport, as they cannot travel on a document issued in their own name.\n* **Emergency passport**: Issued to overseas Japanese nationals when machine-readable passports are unable to be issued by a diplomatic mission of Japan due to a malfunction and there is no time to wait for the passport to be issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan, or to overseas Japanese nationals who failed to be issued a Travel Document for Return to Japan, valid for 1 year from date of issuance.\n\t+ **Travel Document for Return to Japan** (ja:帰国のための渡航書): Emergency single-use travel document issued to overseas Japanese nationals to return to Japan, features a white cover with the Paulownia Government Seal of Japan. Invalidated immediately after use.\n\n\nAll Japanese passports issued after 20 March 2006 are biometric passports.\n\n\nJapanese passports have the Chrysanthemum Imperial Seal of Japan inscribed in the centre of the front cover, with the Japanese characters reading *Nipponkoku Ryoken* (日本国旅券) inscribed above in seal script and its English translation *JAPAN PASSPORT* in Latin letters below the Seal. Ordinary passports valid for five years feature dark blue covers, and those valid for ten years feature crimson-coloured covers. Additionally, official passports feature dark green covers, and diplomatic passports feature dark brown covers.\n\n\n\n### Data page[edit]\n\n\n* Photo of the passport holder\n* Type\n* Issuing country\n* Passport number\n* Surname (possibly followed by a former surname[b] or an alternative surname[c] written in brackets)\n* Given name (possibly followed by an alternative give name[c] written in brackets)\n* Nationality (Japan)\n* Date of birth\n* Sex\n* Registered Domicile\n* Date of issue\n* Date of expiry\n* Issuing authority\n* Signature of bearer\n\n\nThe information page ends with the Machine Readable Zone.\n\n\n\n## Passport photo requirements[edit]\n\n\nPhoto for Japan passport should meet specific requirements:\n\n\n\n* Size: 35mm by 45mm and(pixels): 600 dpi minimum.\n* Head size and position: From chin to forehead should be 32mm to 36mm.\n* Photo must be in color.\n* Must be taken in the last 6 months.\n* Background: Solid white only. No other objects visible, like door, windows etc.\n* Neutral face expression.\n* 2 passport photos per application.\n* Head cover is allowed for religious or medical reasons.\n\n\n### Passport note[edit]\n\n\nThe passports contain a note from the issuing country that is addressed to the authorities of all other countries, identifying the bearer as a citizen of that country and requesting that he or she be allowed to pass and be treated according to international norms. The note inside of Japanese passports states:\n\n\nIn Japanese:\n\n\n\n*日本国民である本旅券の所持人を通路故障なく旅行させ、かつ、同人に必要な保護扶助を与えられるよう、関係の諸官に要請する。　日本国外務大臣*\nIn English:\n\n\n\n*The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan requests all those whom it may concern to allow the bearer, a Japanese national, to pass freely and without hindrance and, in case of need, to afford him or her every possible aid and protection.*\n### Language[edit]\n\n\nJapanese passports are entirely printed in both Japanese and English, except for the note of caution that is found at the end of the passport (e.g. on page 51 of the ten-year biometric ordinary passport), which is only printed in Japanese. This note contains information about what the bearer should know when encountering various situations in a foreign country.\n\n\nThe surname, given name and other personalised mentions (like registered domicile) are only indicated in Latin uppercase letters. Japanese names are in principle transcribed according to the Hepburn romanisation system, but exceptions are admitted in certain cases, notably when the name is the katakana transcription of a foreign name (such as Japanese spouse or Japanese child of a foreigner), in which case the original spelling of the name in the Latin alphabet may be used.\n\n\nThe signature may be written in any language and in any spelling the individual desires.\n\n\n\n## Visa requirements[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Visa requirements for Japanese citizens\n\n![](image)Countries and territories with visa-free entries or visas on arrival for holders of regular Japanese passports\nVisa requirements for Japanese citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states which are placed on citizens of Japan. As of 20 July 2023, Japanese citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 189 countries and territories, ranking the Japanese passport the third most powerful passport in the world in terms of travel freedom according to the Henley Passport Index,[9] dropping from first place for the first time in 5 years.[8]\n\n\n\n## Gallery of Japanese passports[edit]\n\n\n* ![First Japanese passport, issued in 1866](image)\n\nFirst Japanese passport, issued in 1866\n* ![Japanese passport issued to Denjū Horiuchi (ja) in 1903](image)\n\nJapanese passport issued to Denjū Horiuchi (ja) in 1903\n* ![Imperial Japanese Overseas Passport issued in Taiwan in 1917](image)\n\nImperial Japanese Overseas Passport issued in Taiwan in 1917\n* ![Restricted passports for passengers travelling between Mainland Japan and Okinawa during 1952–1972](image)\n\nRestricted passports for passengers travelling between Mainland Japan and Okinawa during 1952–1972\n* ![Front cover of a non-machine-readable Japanese passport issued in the 1980s](image)\n\nFront cover of a non-machine-readable Japanese passport issued in the 1980s\n* ![5 year validity Japanese passport](image)\n\n5 year validity Japanese passport\n* ![Japanese official passport](image)\n\nJapanese official passport\n* ![Travel Document for Return to Japan](image)\n\nTravel Document for Return to Japan\n* ![Re-entry Permit](image)\n\nRe-entry Permit\n* ![Refugee Convention travel document](image)\n\nRefugee Convention travel document\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Japan portal\n* ![icon](image)Politics portal\n\n\n* Japan Re-entry Permit\n* Foreign relations of Japan\n* Japanese nationality law\n* Visa requirements for Japanese citizens\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** 7 April 1866 in the Old Style lunisolar calendar.\n2. **^** A former surname (旧姓, *kyūsei*) is a Japanese legal surname that an individual used to possess, hence limited to the former family registries (*koseki*) to which they belonged.\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** A name (呼称, *koshō*) differing from the legal Japanese name can be printed on the passport, enclosed in parentheses: an alternative surname (別姓, *bessei*), or an alternative name (別名, *betsumei*).

It enables the bearer to exit and re-enter Singapore freely, travel to and from other countries in accordance with visa requirements, facilitates the process of securing assistance from Singapore consular officials abroad, if necessary, and requests protection for the bearer while abroad.\n\n\nAll Singapore passports are issued exclusively by the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) on behalf of the Ministry of Home Affairs. Only Singapore citizens are eligible for this passport. The passport is valid for ten years. The Singapore passport is one of the most powerful passports in the world, having been placed as the most powerful passport itself on numerous occasions. In 2023, the Singapore passport has been ranked the most powerful passport in the world, with visa-free or visa on arrival access to 194 countries and territories.[5]\n\n\nSubsequently, the Singapore passport is a popular target for counterfeiters due to the relatively liberal visa requirements for Singaporeans and the tendency for immigration officials to clear Singapore passport holders more quickly.[6] In response, the ICA has thus adopted several measures to foil forgers, including adding digital photos and special ink since October 1999, and converting to a biometric passport from August 2006.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Historic Singaporean British passport of novelist H.

Between 1963 and 1965, Malaysian passports were issued to residents of Singapore when it formed part of Malaysia, and CUKC British passports were issued prior to 1963.[7] The Straits Settlements, of which Singapore was its capital from 1832 until 1946, also issued its own passports prior to World War II.[8]\n\n\n\n### Singapore Restricted Passport (blue cover)[edit]\n\n\nBetween 1967 and 1999, Singapore also issued a Restricted Passport with a blue cover mainly for travel to West Malaysia. The Restricted Passport was conceived due to the fact that many Singaporeans would regularly travel to West Malaysia for business and leisure purposes. The Restricted Passport ceased to be issued after 1999 due to a lack of demand and the red Singapore Passport was deemed to be the only valid travel document for overseas travel by Singapore citizens from 1 January 2000.[9]\n\n\n\n\n## Validity[edit]\n\n\nThe Singapore passport is valid for a period of ten years for passports issued since 1 April 2005 and ten years for passports issued before said date. Before biometric passports were issued on 15 August 2006, passports for male citizens between 11 and 18 were only valid for two years, and had to be renewed or replaced every two years. Biometric passports cannot be modified due to the \"write once\" policy by ICAO. A new passport is valid for a total period of five years. For the renewal of a passport that has a validity of nine months or less, the new one will have a validity of five years plus the remaining validity in the old passport. However, if a passport is being renewed with a validity of more than nine months, it will be valid for five years and nine months.[10] To travel overseas, a passport must be valid for at least six months.\n\n\nNew passports issued on or after 1 October 2021 for people aged 16 or above will again have a validity of 10 years, with the government citing improved confidence in the security of biometric passports.[11]\n\n\n\n## Biometric passport[edit]\n\n\nSince 15 August 2006, all newly issued Singapore passports contain biometric features (BioPass). A major reason for this addition is to comply with the requirements for the US Visa Waiver Program.[12] The features also help to prevent forgery and minimise the abuse of Singapore passports. The biometric passports contain 64 pages, unlike the machine readable passports, which contain 96 pages. It costs S$70 for a passport. One can apply for the passport on the Internet, by post or by deposit box with applicants having to collect the passport personally. However, if the application is made in person at a Singaporean overseas mission, it will cost S$80 in foreign currency equivalent.[11]\n\n\nThe biometric passport is valid for 5 years for first time applicants, compared with 10 years for previously issued passports without biometric features. Also, the new passport does not accept modifications such as extensions of validity, and updating of photographs due to ICAO's \"write once\" policy.[13] In a break from long standing practice, the passport number is now unique to each passport, instead of being identical to the holder's NRIC number.[13] Children are no longer allowed to travel on their parents' passports.[14] The biometric passport project cost the Singapore government a total of S$9.7 million.[15]\n\n\nA new Singapore biometric passport design was introduced on 26 October 2017. It features a redesigned front cover as well as several new security features such as a Multiple Laser Image (MLI) in the shape of Singapore Island and a window lock of the image of the passport holder which can be viewed as a positive or negative image when tilted and viewed under a light source. New visa page designs, featuring the Singapore Botanic Gardens, Esplanade, Marina Barrage, Gardens by the Bay, Singapore Sports Hub and Punggol New Town were also introduced in the new biometric passport, replacing the previous Central Business District and Esplanade visa page designs.[16]\n\n\n\n## Physical appearance[edit]\n\n\n### Front cover[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Contemporary front cover design Singapore biometric passports issued since 2017\nSingapore passports are red in colour, with the words \"**REPUBLIC OF SINGAPORE**\" inscribed at the top of the front cover, and the coat of arms of Singapore emblazoned in the centre of the front cover. The motto and the title of the national anthem of Singapore, Majulah Singapura, is inscribed on the scroll of the coat of arms, whilst the word **\"PASSPORT\"** is inscribed below. The biometric passport symbol ![](image) appears at the bottom of the front cover under the word **\"PASSPORT\"**.\n\n\n\n### Passport note[edit]\n\n\nThe passport contains a note from the President of Singapore addressing the authorities of all territories:\n\n\n\n\n> *The President of the Republic of Singapore requests all authorities to allow the Singapore citizen named in this passport to pass without delay or hindrance and, if necessary, to give all assistance and protection.*\n> \n> \n\n\n### Information page[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Specimen hard polycarbonate Data and Information page of Singapore Passports\nSingapore passports include the following data on the plastic information page:\n\n\n\n* (left) Photo of the passport bearer\n* Type (PA – biometric passport)\n* Code of issuing state (SGP)\n* Passport number\n* Full name\n* Sex (Gender)\n* Nationality (Singapore Citizen)\n* Date of birth\n* Place of birth\n* Date of issue\n* Date of expiry\n* Modifications\n* Authority\n* National ID number\n\n\nThe information page ends with the Machine Readable Zone.\n\n\n\n### Biometric chip[edit]\n\n\nThe embedded chip stores the owner's digitised photograph, name, sex, date of birth, nationality, passport number, and the passport expiry date. This is the same information that appears on the printed information page of every passport. Facial recognition technology was introduced with the release of the ePassport to improve identity verification and reduce identity-related fraud. Iris imaging was later added to complement the biometric fingerprint.\n\n\n\n## Visa requirements[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Visa requirements for Singaporean citizens\n\n![](image)Visa requirements for Singaporean citizensSingapore\nVisa not required / ESTA\n Visa obtainable on arrival\n Electronic authorisation or eVisa\n Visa available both on arrival or online\n Visa required prior to arrival\n\nVisa requirements for Singapore citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states which are placed on citizens of Singapore. As of July 2023, Singapore citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 192 countries and territories, ranking the Singapore passport the most powerful in the world in terms of travel freedom, according to the Henley Passport Index.[5] The Singapore passport often periodically switches between being 1st or 2nd on the list.\n\n\n\n## Automated border control systems[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Automated border control system\n\nSingapore citizens aged 6 and older are eligible to use the automated clearance lanes at the country's checkpoints, provided that their biometric identifiers (iris / facial / fingerprints) have been enrolled with ICA.[17] In addition, for young Singapore citizens who wish to use the automated lanes but had collected their passports before turning six, they may enrol their biometrics at the staffed immigration counters (with the supervision of their parent / guardian).[17]\n\n\nIn addition, with Singapore's developed and high-income status, Singapore citizens who intend to travel as tourists, are also eligible to use the automated border control systems (eGates) when arriving in (or departing from) the various following countries:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Country/Region\n | Visa-Exemption\n | Duration of Allowed initial stay\n | Name of Immigration Authority\n | Name of ABC System\n | Ref\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Australia | Electronic Travel Authority | 90 days\n | Australian Border Force (ABF)\n | SmartGate | [18] |\n| ![](image) France | Visa not required\n | 90 days (within any 180-day period in the Schengen Area)\n | Direction centrale de la police aux frontières (DCPAF)\n | PARAFE | [19] |\n| ![](image) Hong Kong | Visa not required\n | 90 days\n | Immigration Department (Hong Kong) | e-Channel | [20] |\n| ![](image) Italy | Visa not required\n | 90 days (within any 180-day period in the Schengen Area)\n | Polizia di Frontiera | EGate (Italy) | [21] |\n| ![](image) Japana | Visa not required\n | 90 days\n | Immigration Services Agency of Japan (ISA)\n | Automated Gates\n | [22] |\n| ![](image) Malaysiab | Visa not required\n | 30 days\n | Immigration Department of Malaysia | Autogate/e-gate\n | [23][24] |\n| ![](image) New Zealand | Electronic Travel Authority | 3 months\n | New Zealand Customs Service | eGate | [25] |\n| ![](image) Portugal | Visa not required\n | 90 days (within any 180-day period in the Schengen Area)\n | Serviço de Estrangeiros e Fronteiras (SEF)\n | RAPID4ALL | [26] |\n| ![](image) Thailandc | Visa not required\n | 30 days\n | Royal Thai Police Immigration Bureau | Automated Passport Control (APC)\n | [27][28][29] |\n| ![](image) United Arab Emiratesd | Visa not required\n | 30 days\n | Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security (FAICCPS)\n | Smart Gate\n | [30] |\n| ![](image) United Kingdom | Visa not required\n | 6 months\n | UK Border Force | EPassport gates | [31] |\n| ![](image) United States | Visa Waiver Program | 90 days\n | U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)\n | Automated Passport Control (APC)\n | [32][33] |\n\n\na) The Trusted Traveller Program offered by the Immigration Services Agency of Japan (ISA), is limited to:\n\n\n- directors or full-time employees of the Government of Singapore and its public and corporate affiliates.\n\n\n- directors or full-time employees of international organizations.\n\n\n- directors or full-time employees of public companies listed in Japan and their subsidiaries.\n\n\n- directors or full-time employees of public companies listed in the visa-exempt countries under Japanese visa policy.\n\n\n- directors or full-time employees of private companies with capital or investment of JPY 500 million.\n\n\n- business relationship foreign invitee of Japanese government-affiliated institutions or Japanese publicly-listed corporations (and their subsidiaries).\n\n\n- tourists with platinum or higher-status credit cards.\n\n\n- spouse or child (unmarried minor) of aforementioned businesspeople or high-net-worth tourists.\n\n\nb) The e-gate can only be used after first-time arrival and registration at the manual immigration counter.

A dual citizen may have acquired citizenship by birth in a foreign country, by descent from a foreign citizen parent, or by registration. Singapore citizens who voluntarily and intentionally acquire citizenship of a foreign country after the age of 18 may be deprived of their Singapore citizenship by the Government.[34] Foreigners who naturalise as Singapore citizens are required to renounce all foreign citizenships.[35] Persons who are born outside of Singapore and have at least one parent who is a Singapore citizen may register with a Singapore consulate within a year to acquire Singapore citizenship by descent. However, such persons who acquire foreign citizenship (by birth in a *jus soli* country or naturalisation in another country at an early age) must choose one citizenship before reaching 22 years of age.\n\n\nSingapore passports issued to dual citizens have their maximum validity capped at up to their 22nd birthday. They can be renewed for the usual 5 year validity free of cost after renunciation of foreign citizenship and completion of the Oath of Renunciation, Allegiance and Loyalty (ORAL) before reaching 22 years of age.\n\n\n\n## National Service issues[edit]\n\n\nAll male citizens are required to be conscripted for two years as National Service (NS). Previously, the Singapore government had a policy of limiting the validity of the passport for boys aged 11 and above. Before travel, they had to apply for a 9-month extension of their passports. Such extensions were added with a rubber stamp. The Singapore government has stated that the objective of such exit control measures is to deter NS-evasion, and that these measures serve as a \"psychological reminder\" of the citizen's NS obligations.\n\n\nSince the new biometric passport does not permit such modifications, a decision was made by the Ministry of Defence to do away with limited-validity passports. Exit permits are still required for overseas trips which last longer than twelve months.[36]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"ICA – History of Travel Documents & Passes\".

Like any other passport, South Korean passports serve as proof for passport holders' personal information, such as nationality and date of birth. South Korean passports are issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and have been printed by the Korea Minting and Security Printing Corporation (KOMSCO) since 1973.[6] On 21 December 2021, issuing the next generation biometric passports to South Korean citizens has begun, which was delayed by one year as planned due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[7][5]\n\n\n\n\n## Types[edit]\n\n\n* **Ordinary passport (일반여권)**: Issued to normal citizens. Ordinary passports are issued for one, five, or ten years of validity, depending on age of bearer (see below for details).\n* **Diplomatic passport (외교관여권)**: Issued to President, Prime Minister, Minister and Deputy Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Korea, diplomats and citizens who serve under diplomatic terms. These passports guarantee special treatment in other countries.\n* **Official passport (관용여권)**: Issued to members of Parliament of Korea, members of Provincial Legislatures and civil servants in Government of Korea, Provincial Governments and Local Municipalities during his or her term.\n\n\n* ![Ordinary passport](image)\n\nOrdinary passport\n* ![Diplomatic passport](image)\n\nDiplomatic passport\n* ![Official passport](image)\n\nOfficial passport\n\n\n## Expiration & Cost[8][edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Type | Multiple/Single | Validity | Number of Pages | Cost\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Biometric | Multiple | 10 Years (18 or above) | 58 | KRW 53,000\n |\n| 26 | KRW 50,000\n |\n| 5 Years (under 18) | 58 | KRW 45,000\n(KRW 33,000 for under 8)\n |\n| 26 | KRW 42,000\n(KRW 30,000 for under 8)\n |\n| Below 5 Years[9] | 26 | KRW 15,000\n |\n| Single | Below 1 Year | 14 | KRW 20,000\n |\n| Non-Biometric[10] | Single | Below 1 Year | 14 | KRW 53,000\n |\n| 14 | KRW 20,000[11] |\n\n\n* KRW 25,000 for a new passport with the same date of expiry as one's previous passport.\n* KRW 5,000 to change details on one's old passport.\n\n\n## Physical appearance[edit]\n\n\nSouth Korean ordinary passports are dark blue, with the National Emblem of the Republic of Korea emblazoned in gold in the top right of the front cover. The words '**대한민국 여권'** (Korean) and '**REPUBLIC OF KOREA PASSPORT'** (English) \nare inscribed below the Emblem, whereas the international e-passport symbol (![](image)) is inscribed on the bottom right of the front cover. Lastly, the Taegeuk mark with dotted circles is embossed on the left side of the front cover.\n\n\n\n### Difference with DPRK passport[edit]\n\n\nIn North Korea, the Korean word for '*passport'* is spelled '려권' (*ryeogwon*), whereas in South Korea, the same word is written as '여권' (*yeogwon*).\n\n\n\n### Identity Information Page[edit]\n\n\n* Photo of the passport holder\n* Type (PM or PR or PS): PM passports can be used for multiple entries, while PS passports are valid for a single entry. PR passports are for Koreans who are permanent residents of countries other than Korea.[12] However, the PR type passport has been abolished as of 21 December 2017, and permanent residents of other countries now receive a normal passport[13]\n* Issuing country code: **KOR**\n* Passport number: Includes a total of nine digits; in passports issued from 25 August 2008 onward, the passport number will retain the same 9 digits, but the Issued Local code will be changed to a single letter 'M' denoting PM passports and 'S' for PS passports. The remaining 8 digits will be the serial number.\n* Surname: Passports from other nations such as Bulgaria[14] and Greece[15] have the bearer's name written in the local script alongside the Latin alphabet. However, in the South Korean passport, only the Latin alphabet is permitted for use in the surname and given name sections. Their local script name is written in the separate *hangul* name section.\n* Given names\n* Hangul name\n* Date of birth\n* Sex\n* Nationality: Republic of Korea\n* Issuing authority: Ministry of Foreign Affairs\n* Date of issue\n* Date of expiry\n\n\n#### Information removed from new passports since 21 December 2021[edit]\n\n\n* Personal ID number *(Resident registration number of South Korea):* Prior to 2015, South Korean passports issued to Zainichi Koreans did not have resident registration numbers, reflecting their statutory exemption from taxation and conscription in South Korea (Conversely, Zainichi Koreans were not allowed to vote.[16] However, from 2012, all Korean passport holders are eligible to vote,[17] and in 2015, Zainichi Koreans were allowed to obtain a resident registration number regardless of their statutory exemptions[18]).\n\n\n### Passport message[edit]\n\n\nThe message inside South Korean passports are written in both Korean and English. The message in the passport, nominally from the South Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs, states:\n\n\nIn Korean:\n\n\n\n이 여권을 소지한 대한민국 국민이 아무 지장 없이 통행할 수 있도록 하여 주시고 필요한 모든 편의와 보호를 베풀어 주실 것을 관계자 여러분께 요청합니다.\nIn English:\n\n\n\n*The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Korea requests all whom it may concern to permit the bearer, a national of the Republic of Korea, to pass freely without delay or hindrance and to provide every possible assistance and protection in case of need.*\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nThe textual portions of passports are printed in both English and Korean.\n\n\n\n## Biometric passport[edit]\n\n\nThe South Korean government has been issuing biometric passports since February 2008 for diplomats and government officials, and for the general population since 24 August 2008.\n\n\nThe South Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs formed the \"Committee for Promoting e-Passports\" in April 2006, which scheduled to issue biometric passports during the second half of 2008. On 4 September 2007, media reports indicated that the South Korean government had decided to revise its passport law to issue biometric passports which included fingerprint information: First to diplomats during the first quarter of 2008, and to the general public during the second half of the year. Some civil groups have protested the fingerprinting requirement as excessive as the ICAO only requires a photograph to be recorded on the biometric chip.\n\n\nOn 26 February 2008, the South Korean legislature passed a revision of the passport law. A new biometric passport was issued to diplomats in March, and to the general public shortly thereafter. Fingerprinting measures would not be implemented immediately; however, they began on 1 January 2010.\n\n\nThe appearance of the new biometric passports is almost identical to the former machine-readable versions, and they both have 48 pages. However, the space for visas was reduced by six pages. These pages are now reserved for identification purposes, notices and other information, as well as the bearer's contacts. In the new biometric passports, the main identification page has moved to the second page from inside the front cover. The note from the Foreign Affairs Minister is still shown on the front page and the signature is shown on the page after photo identification.\n\n\nThe new biometric passport incorporates many security features such as colour shifting ink, hologram, ghost image, infrared ink, intaglio, laser perforation of the passport number (from the third page to the back cover), latent image, microprinting, security thread, solvent sensitive ink, and steganography.[6]\n\n\n\n![](image)A caution page for the biometric chip\nInside the first page, a caution for the biometric chip is written both in Korean,\n\n\n\n\n> \n> \"주의 – 이 여권에는 민감한 전자 칩이 내장되어 있습니다. 여권을 접거나 구멍을 뚫거나 극한 환경(온도,습도)에 노출하면 여권이 손상될 수 있으니 주의하여 주시기 바랍니다.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nand in English,\n\n\n\n\n> \n> \"This passport contains sensitive electronics, For best performance please do not bend, perforate or expose to extreme temperatures or excess moisture.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nThe passport holders' contact information that was originally held inside the back cover has also been moved to the last page of the new passport.\n\n\n\n## New passports issued from 2021[edit]\n\n\nFrom 21 December 2021, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issues a new biometric passport. The passport has been redesigned entirely with improvements in security. The identification page is made of polycarbonate in order to make it harder to forge. The colour of the cover of the ordinary passport has changed from green to navy blue. The bearer's personal ID number *(Resident registration number of South Korea)* is removed from the passport for greater security. The new passport was originally intended to be issued from June 2020 for diplomatic and official passports holders and December 2020 for those holding an ordinary passport. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of traveling citizens declined resulting in the delay of the new passport's introduction until late 2021 or whenever the current passport booklet stock is depleted.[19] Diplomatic and officials passports are issued as planned.\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\nAs of January 2009, the Korea Minting and Security Printing Corporation takes eight hours to produce the new biometric passport and is capable of producing 26,500 passports per day.[6]\n\n\n\n## Visa free travel[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Visa requirements for South Korean citizens\n\n![](image)Visa requirements for South Korean citizens South Korea\n Visa not required / ESTA / eTA / eVisitor\n Visa on arrival\n eVisa\n Visa available both on arrival or online\n Visa required\n Travel banned by the South Korean government due to safety concerns or admission refused\n\nVisa requirements for South Korean citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of Republic of Korea. As of 19 September 2022, South Korean citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 192 countries and territories, ranking the South Korean passport second in the world in terms of travel freedom (tied with the Singaporean passport, and one ranking down from the Japanese passport) according to the Henley Passport Index.[20] Additionally, Arton Capital's Passport Index currently rank the South Korean passport third in the world in terms of travel freedom, with a visa-free score of 165 (tied with Danish, Dutch, French, Finnish, Italian, Luxembourgish, Norwegian, Singaporean, Spanish, Swedish and United States passports), as of 15 January 2019.[21]\n\n\nAs of October 2018, the passports of South Korea, Brunei and Chile are the only ones to provide visa-free access to all G8 countries.\n\n\n\n## Inter-Korean travel[edit]\n\n\nThe South Korean (Republic of Korea) constitution considers North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) as part of its territory, although under a different administration. In other words, the South does not view going to and from the North as breaking the continuity of a person's stay, as long as the traveler does not land on third country, i.e. non-Korean, territory.\n\n\nHowever, because of the political situation between the South and the isolated socialist *Juche* government of North Korea, it is almost impossible to enter the North from the South across the Korean DMZ (exiting South Korea via the northern border). Tourists wishing to enter North Korea have to pass through another country, and most enter from China, because most flights to/from Pyongyang serve Beijing.\n\n\nSouth Koreans are generally not allowed to visit North Korea, except with special authorizations granted by the Ministry of Unification and North Korean authorities on a limited basis (e.g. workers and businessmen visiting or commuting to/from Kaesong Industrial Complex). South Koreans who are allowed to visit North Korea are issued a North Korean visa on a separate sheet of paper, not in the South Korean passport. The Republic of Korea passport can be used to enter North Korea, because passport is one of the government's approved identity documents, but it is being only to prove the bearer's identity, not to determine the bearer's legal residence.[22] South Koreans can also use other government approved identity documents such as National ID Card and Driver's License, because the South Korean government treats North Korea as part of South Korea and expects South Korean IDs to be accepted.\n\n\nIn 1998, visa-free travel to the tourist resort of Mount Kumgang and the Kaesong Industrial Region was made possible under the \"sunshine policy\" orchestrated by South Korean President Kim Dae-jung. Those wishing to travel across the DMZ were given special travel certificates issued by the Ministry of Unification through Hyundai Asan. In July 2008, a female tourist named Park Wang-ja was shot to death by a North Korean guard on a beach near Mount Kumgang, which led to the suspension of the tours. As of March 2010 all travel across the DMZ has now been suspended due to increasing tensions between North and South Korea. However, in 2018, Kim Jong-un and others went to South Korea through the DMZ and met up with South Korean officials. They discussed reunification.[23]\n\n\nThere are four land border checkpoints in South Korea for inter-Korea travel.\n\n\n\n## Restricted nations[edit]\n\n\nThe South Korean government has banned Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen as travel destinations for safety reasons.[24][25] Due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, South Koreans are banned from travelling to that country as well.\n\n\n\n## Gallery of South Korean passports[edit]\n\n\n* ![A Korean Empire travel passport issued in 1905.](image)\n\nA Korean Empire travel passport issued in 1905.\n* ![A machine-readable Republic of Korea passport issued in 1994.](image)\n\nA machine-readable Republic of Korea passport issued in 1994.\n* ![A machine-readable, non-biometric Republic of Korea passport issued in 2005.](image)\n\nA machine-readable, non-biometric Republic of Korea passport issued in 2005.\n* ![A biometric Republic of Korea passport issued between 25 August 2008 and 20 December 2021.](image)\n\nA biometric Republic of Korea passport issued between 25 August 2008 and 20 December 2021.\n* ![Specimen of the identity information page of Republic of Korea biometric passport issued until 20 December 2021.](image)\n\nSpecimen of the identity information page of Republic of Korea biometric passport issued until 20 December 2021.\n* ![A current version of the biometric Republic of Korea passport issued from 21 December 2021.](image)\n\nA current version of the biometric Republic of Korea passport issued from 21 December 2021.\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Biometric passports\n* List of passports\n* Visa Waiver Program\n* Visa policy of South Korea\n* South Korean nationality law\n* Visa requirements for South Korean citizens\n* Korean Empire passport\n* North Korean passport\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"[한국이민사박물관 소장품] 1904년 대한제국 여권\". 20 February 2009.\n2. **^** \"Home\".\n3. **^** \"Gov't to issue braille passports : Korea.net : The official website of the Republic of Korea\".\n4. **^** but sometimes passport scan error occurs because of braille.

A German passport is, besides the German ID card and the German Emergency Travel Document (called \"Reiseausweis als Passersatz\"), the only other officially recognised document that German authorities will routinely accept as proof of identity from German citizens. Besides serving as proof of identity and presumption of German nationality, they facilitate the process of securing assistance from German consular officials abroad (or other EU members in the case that a German consular facility is absent). German passports are valid for ten years (for people over the age of 24) or six years (for people under the age of 24) and share the standardised layout and burgundy red design with other EU passports. Every German citizen is also a citizen of the European Union. The passport, along with the national identity card, allows for free rights of movement and residence in any of the states of the European Union, European Economic Area and Switzerland.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nThe first passport regulations of what nowadays constitute the present-day territory of Germany were first enacted by the North German Confederation on 12 October 1867.[2]\n\n\nDuring the First World War and in the interwar period thereafter, supplementary ordinances were issued on the obligation for German citizens to possess a passport.[3] This determined that a visa was required for entry and exit. Passports issued until the end of 1922 were only valid for one year; they could not be renewed after the introduction of the new model after 1923. The *Bekanntmachung zur Ausführung der Paßverordnung* as enacted on 4 June 1924[4] stipulated that only the new type in the form of a 15½ x 10½ cm booklet could be used. Entry and exit visas were also abolished. Such passports, which could only be issued to citizens of the Reich, were now valid for two years. The fee was set at 5 ℛ︁ℳ︁ in 1924.[5] They could be extended for a total period of five years, by one year each. Service passports also followed this pattern. However, their covers were green instead of the otherwise used grey covers. Diplomatic and ministerial passports continued to be issued in sheet form until further notice. Identity cards, which could also be issued to foreigners who could not obtain a passport in their native countries, were regarded as a full-fledged passport replacement. Such documents were valid for one year and could be extended for another year. The fee was set at 10 ℛ︁ℳ︁ in 1924. These identity cards were also considered to be spiritual predecessors of the Nansen passport.\n\n\nBetween 1933 and 1936, the enactment of foreign exchange restrictions (10 marks of silver as cash) and the thousand-mark ban by the Nazi government effectively constituted exit permits.\n\n\nFrom 1949 until 1950, the issuance of West German passports mainly fell under the authority of the Allied High Commission which governed West Germany at that time. On 1 January 1950, the German Office for Entry and Exit Affairs became the main authority for issuing West German passports, although it was still under the control of the Allied High Commission. Only on 1 February 1951 did West Germany gain full rights to issue its own passports independent of the Allied occupying forces.[6] West German passports at that time contained a \"Job Description\" field of the passport holder; this was initially necessary as the Allied occupying forces reserved the right to approve West German citizens obtaining travel visas until 1955. The \"Job Description\" field was eliminated after a passport regulation change on 12 June 1967.\n\n\nIn 1980, the biggest passport scandal in the history of Germany (de:Passfälscherskandal) was uncovered when 19 North American ice hockey players were found to have been fraudulently issued with German passports in order to play in the *Eishockey-Bundesliga*.\n\n\nAfter the reunification of Germany in 1990, residents of the former East Germany were allowed to use valid East German passports for overseas travel until 31 December 1995,[7] after which any such passports with remaining validity were automatically deemed invalid and these people had to apply for and obtain a German passport to travel overseas.\n\n\n\n## Time of processing[edit]\n\n\nProcessing time for a German passport is usually four to six weeks, but one can be issued in three days by using the Express service if processed before 11 am\n\n\n\n## Physical appearance[edit]\n\n\n![](image)First page of a contemporary German passport (March 2017)\n![](image)Signature page and data page of a contemporary German passport (March 2017)\n![](image)Data page of a contemporary German passport glowing under UV-light irradiation\n![](image)Visa section of a contemporary German passport, saying *Sichtvermerke* and \"Visas \"in both English and French (March 2017)\n![](image)Signature page and data page of a German passport (Pre-March 2017)\nGerman passports have, since 1 January 1988, followed the standard European Union passport design, with burgundy red cover and the German Eagle emblazoned in the centre of the front cover. On 23 February 2017, Germany unveiled a new passport design to be put in use from 1 March 2017.[8] The words *Europäische Union* (German for European Union) and *Bundesrepublik Deutschland* (German for Federal Republic of Germany) are inscribed above the coat of arms. The words *\"Reisepass\"* (German for *travel passport*) and *\"Passport\"* and *\"Passeport\"* (English and French respectively, printed in a smaller font) appear below.\n\n\nGerman passports are normally 32 pages long; a 48-page version for frequent travellers can be issued on request.\n\n\n\n### Identity Information Page[edit]\n\n\nThe first two pages of a German passport are security laminated and the second page includes the following data:\n\n\n\n* Photo of passport owner\n* Type of document (P = passport)\n* Code for issuing country (D = Germany)\n* Passport number (9 alphanumeric digits, e.g. C3JJ4789L, chosen from numerals 0–9 and letters C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, R, T, V, W, X, Y, Z. Thus, \"0\" denotes the numeral, not the letter \"O\". The first character is always a letter.[9])\n* Surname )\n* Name at birth\n* Given names\n* Date of birth\n* Sex\n* Nationality Deutsch\n* Place of birth\n* Date of issue\n* Date of expiry\n* Authority that issued the passport\n* Owner's signature (\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_)\n\n\nThe page ends with a 2-line machine readable zone, according to ICAO standard 9303. The country code is not DEU as is the standard country code for Germany (according to ISO 3166-1 alpha-3), but D. This is the only country/citizen code which does not consist of 3 letters.\n\n\nIn November 2001, the so-called *Identigram*[*dead link*] feature was added – a number of holographic security elements, including a three-dimensional eagle, a holographic copy of the holder's picture (the so-called *Holographic Shadow Picture*), a holographic copy of the machine-readable zone, holographic microprinting, and kinematic elements.\n\n\n\n### Following page[edit]\n\n\nThe following page lists:\n\n\n\n* Residence\n* Height\n* Colour of eyes (in German language)\n* Religious name or pseudonym\n\n\n![](image)Interior of a German passport (pre-March 2017, with passport number at the bottom of each page removed)\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nThe data page/information page is printed in German, English, and French. On the second cover (information page) and Page 2, 4, 5, and 32 or 48 there are all 24 official Languages from the European Union which describe the information in other EU languages, for example the Romanian word for authority is Autoritatea emitentă.

It might be necessary to make a name declaration.\n* Confirmation of deregistration (\"Abmeldebescheinigung\") from the German place of residence if it is entered in the current passport as the place of residence, and one copy thereof.\n* Valid residency permit, and one copy thereof.\n* Your driver's license or a utility bill in your name as proof of legal address, and one copy thereof.\n* Your German doctorate certificate if you would like to have your German doctorate degree entered in your passport, and one copy thereof\n* If applicable, German naturalisation document, and one copy thereof\n* If dual citizen, Naturalization Certificate with \"Beibehaltungsgenehmigung\"\n* Passport fee\n* Your Family Register Extract may be needed.\n* If it is the first time you apply as an adult you will need your parents' German passports or a Certificate of Nationality *(\"Staatsangehörigkeitsausweis\")*.\n\n\n### RFID chip with biometric certificate[edit]\n\n\nSince 1 November 2005, German passports have had a contactless smartcard (proximity card) chip and 13.56 MHz loop antenna embedded into the front cover page,[14] in accordance with ICAO standards. The chip and antenna are not easily visually recognisable, but their presence is indicated using the ICAO biometric passport symbol at the bottom of the front cover. It carries all the data printed in the passport, including a JPEG file of the photo, protected by a digital signature. Germany therefore became only the fifth country in the world (after Malaysia, Thailand, Sweden, and Australia) to introduce biometric passports.\n\n\nOn 1 November 2007, several changes were made to the passport:\n\n\n\n* Applicants have to provide, in addition to the traditional passport data, scans of two fingerprints, which are added to the chip.\n* The previously 9-digit, all-numeric, sequentially assigned serial number was replaced with a new alphanumeric pseudorandomly assigned higher-entropy serial number, to increase the entropy of the serial number from the previous 35 digits to 45 bits.[15] This improves the cryptographic key strength of the Basic Access Control mechanism of the RFID chip by 10 bits, which makes a brute force attack approximately 1000 times more expensive.\n* The validity period of passports issued to holders under the age of 24 increases from five to six years; older applicants receive a passport valid for ten years.\n\n\n### Different spellings of the same name within the same document[edit]\n\n\n**German names**: German names containing umlauts (ä, ö, ü) and/or ß are spelled in the correct way in the non-machine-readable zone of the passport, but with AE, OE, UE, and/or SS in the machine-readable zone, e.g. Müller becomes MUELLER, Groß becomes GROSS, and Gößmann becomes GOESSMANN. \nThe transcription mentioned above is generally used for aircraft tickets etc., but sometimes (like in US visas) also simple vowels are used (MULLER, GOSSMANN), so passport, visa, and aircraft ticket may display different spellings of the same name.\nThe three possible spelling variants of the same name (e.g. Müller / Mueller / Muller) in different documents sometimes lead to confusion, and the use of two different spellings within the same document may give persons unfamiliar with German orthography the impression that the document is a forgery.\n\n\n**Non-German names**: In some names of naturalised citizens, some special letters that are not available may always be replaced by simple letters, also in the non-machine-readable zone. The \"*Bundesdruckerei AG,*\" which prints the German passports, uses the font *LA8 Passport,* which includes a Latin subset of the Unicode characters (ISO 10646), so that letters such as ç and ł can be displayed at least in the non-machine-readable passport zone. In the machine-readable zone, special characters are either replaced by simple characters ( e.g., é becomes E) or transcribed according to the ICAO rules (e.g., å becomes AA, ø becomes OE, etc.).\n\n\nNames originally written in a non-Latin writing system may pose another problem if there are various internationally recognised transcription standards.\n\n\nFor example, the Russian surname **Горбачёв** is transcribed \n\n\n\n\"Gorba**tschow**\" in German,\n\"Gorba**chev**\" in English (also ICAO standard),\n\"Gorba**tchov**\" in French,\n\"Gorba**chov**\" in Spanish,\n\"Gorba**czow**\" in Polish, and so on.\nGerman naming law accepts umlauts and/or ß in family names as a reason for an official name change (even just the change of the spelling, e.g. from Müller to Mueller or from Weiß to Weiss is regarded as a name change).\n\n\n\n## Issuing process[edit]\n\n\nGerman passports are issued, just like German ID cards, by local municipal registration offices. Applicants have to apply for a new passport in person and the data in newly issued passports is essentially an authenticated copy of the personal data found in locally stored registration documents. Passports are then manufactured centrally at the Bundesdruckerei in Berlin.\n\n\nA German passport (32 pages, delivered within a month, issued to a person 24 years and older) costs €60.[16] A passport for a person under the age of 24 which has a validity of six years costs €37.50. A 48 pages passport costs a premium of €22, express delivery a premium of €32.\n\n\n\n## Child's Passport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Front cover of a *Kinderreisepass*\nA type of passport issued by Germany since 2006 is a child passport (in German: Kinderreisepass). Unlike a regular German passport, the Kinderreisepass does not include biometric features and lacks the inscription \"European Union\" at the top of the front cover. The exclusion of biometric information is due to the ongoing development of infants and young children and the low security risk they pose; nevertheless, the photo used in the passport does have to comply with biometric standards. All other features are similar to those of a regular passport: the burgundy red colour and the German coat of arms printed at the centre of the front cover. Children's passports are issued for children up to twelve years of age and are valid for a period of six years. When a child reaches the age of twelve, a regular passport must be obtained for international travel.\n\n\nA child passport has sixteen pages (unlike the regular's 32), of which eleven are designated for stamping and the others are used for a title page, instructions and personal information. The first page features the words \"Child's Passport\" in three languages: German, English, and French.\n\n\nUnlike a regular passport, the information pages in a Kinderreisepass are not security laminated (yet do have other security features) and have a different format. The information included is more or less the same, with the following differences: The type of passport is PC (Passport for children) instead of P (Passport). As in other passports, the main information page ends with a 2-line machine-readable code, according to ICAO standard 9303.\n\n\nA child passport serves just like any other passport, with the exception that it is not biometric (or e-Passport). As a result, travelling to the US, for example, requires a tourist visa in spite of Germany's participation in the United States Visa Waiver Program. Alternatively, infants and children of any age are allowed to obtain a regular German passport (biometric) instead of a child's passport, which nevertheless has the advantages of low cost, short processing times, and being issuable by honorary consuls (making them easier to obtain by German emigrants who live far away from a German embassy or consulate). Just like provisional passports, children's passports are issued without being sent to the Bundesdruckerei GmbH in Berlin, which is the main reason behind these advantages.\n\n\n\n## Holding a second passport[edit]\n\n\n### Second German passport[edit]\n\n\nGermany allows its citizens *in exceptional cases* to hold more than one valid German passport to circumvent certain travel restrictions. (For example, some Arab countries refuse entry if the passport contains an Israeli stamp; journalists may need several passports when travelling abroad when passports have been sent to consular officials for visas that take a long time to issue.) In extreme cases, up to 10 German passports can be held at the same time. However, these additional passports are valid for only 6 years even if the \"original\" passport is valid for 10 years.\n\n\n\n### Dual citizenship[edit]\n\n\nThe right to hold both a German passport and a foreign passport at the same time (dual citizenship) is restricted under the current German nationality law. Germany allows dual citizenship with other EU countries and Switzerland; dual citizenship with other countries is possible with special permission or if obtained at birth (for example, one German parent and one foreign parent, or if a child is born to German parents in a jus soli country such as the United States of America or Brazil). Under Article 116 par. 2 of the Basic Law (Grundgesetz), former German citizens who between January 30, 1933, and May 8, 1945, were deprived of their German citizenship on political, racial, or religious grounds may re-invoke their citizenship and the same applies to their descendants, and are permitted to hold dual (or multiple) citizenship.[17]\n\n\nChildren born on or after 1 January 2000 to non-German parents acquire German citizenship at birth if at least one parent has a permanent residence permit (and had this status for at least three years) and the parent was residing in Germany for at least eight years. The children must have lived in Germany for at least eight years or attended school for six years until their 21st birthday. Non-EU- and non-Swiss-citizen parents born and grown up abroad usually cannot have dual citizenship themselves (but exceptions are made for citizens of countries that do not allow the renunciation of citizenship or have too expensive/difficult/humiliating renunciation procedures and for citizens whose citizenship was restored under Article 116 (2)).\n\n\nNaturalized Germans can lose their German citizenship if it is found out that they got it by willful deceit/bribery/menacing/giving intentionally false or incomplete information that had been important for the naturalization process if they still possess citizenship of another country. In June 2019, it was decided to prolong the deadline from five to ten years after naturalization.\n\n\nA law adopted in June 2019 allows for the revocation of the German citizenship of dual citizens who have joined or supported a terror group such as the Islamic State and are at least 18 years old.[18]\n\n\n\n## The travel freedom of German citizens[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Visa requirements for German citizens\n\n![](image)**Visa requirements for German citizens** Germany\n Freedom of movement\n Visa not required / ETA / EASE / ESTA / NZeTA / eVisitor / K-ETA\n Visa on arrival\n eVisa\n Visa available both on arrival or online\n Visa required prior to arrival\n\nVisa requirements for German citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of Germany. As of June 2023, German citizens had visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 191 countries and territories, ranking the German passport third in the world and first in Europe and the EU in terms of travel freedom (tied with the Italian and Spanish passport) according to the Henley Passport Index.[19]\n\n\nGerman citizens can live and work in any country within the EU as a result of the right of free movement and residence granted in Article 21 of the EU Treaty.[20]\n\n\n\n## Gallery of German passports[edit]\n\n\n* ![1922–24 German \"Personalausweis als Paßersatz\", primarily but not exclusively issued to stateless Russian refugees](image)\n\n1922–24 German *\"Personalausweis als Paßersatz\"*, primarily but not exclusively issued to stateless Russian refugees\n* ![1927 German Ministerialpass issued to Dr. Fritz Norden](image)\n\n1927 German Ministerialpass issued to Dr. Fritz Norden\n* ![1940s issued German temporary alien's passport (\"Vorläufiger Fremdenpass\")](image)\n\n1940s issued German temporary alien's passport (*\"Vorläufiger Fremdenpass\"*)\n* ![1944 issued German service passport for use by an official abroad](image)\n\n1944 issued German service passport for use by an official abroad\n* ![1945 issued German regular passport](image)\n\n1945 issued German regular passport\n* ![1950 Allied Military Government issued temporary German passport for stateless & undefined persons](image)\n\n1950 Allied Military Government issued temporary German passport for stateless & undefined persons\n* ![Front cover of a West German passport issued in 1982](image)\n\nFront cover of a West German passport issued in 1982\n* ![Front cover of a machine-readable, non-biometric German passport (with \"European Community\" wording on top) issued from 1988 until the early-2000s](image)\n\nFront cover of a machine-readable, non-biometric German passport (with \"European Community\" wording on top) issued from 1988 until the early-2000s\n* ![Front cover of a machine-readable, non-biometric German EU passport issued from the early-2000s until November 2005](image)\n\nFront cover of a machine-readable, non-biometric German EU passport issued from the early-2000s until November 2005\n* ![Provisional German passport issued in exceptional circumstances (\"Vorläufiger Reisepass\")](image)\n\nProvisional German passport issued in exceptional circumstances (*\"Vorläufiger Reisepass\"*)\n* ![Refugee Convention travel document 2017](image)\n\nRefugee Convention travel document 2017\n* ![Front cover of a machine-readable, biometric German EU passport issued from 2005 until 2017](image)\n\nFront cover of a machine-readable, biometric German EU passport issued from 2005 until 2017\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* East German passport\n* German identity card\n* Passports of the European Union\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** § 15 Gebühren\n2. **^** Bundesgesetzblatt des Norddeutschen Bundes, p. 33.\n3. **^** 21 June 1916, Reichsgesetzblatt (RGBl). p. 599; 10 June 1919, RGBl. p. 516.\n4. **^** RGBl.
