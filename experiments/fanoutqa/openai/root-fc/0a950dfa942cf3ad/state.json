This discrepancy was deduced from comparing the CIA *World Factbook* and its previous iterations against the information for United States in *Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica*, particularly its footnote section.[13] In sum, according to older versions of the CIA *World Factbook* (from 1982 to 1996), the U.S. was listed as the world's fourth-largest country (after Russia, Canada, and China) with a total area of 9,372,610\u00a0km2 (3,618,780\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). However, in the 1997 edition, the U.S. added coastal waters to its total area (increasing it to 9,629,091\u00a0km2 (3,717,813\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)). And then again in 2007, U.S. added territorial water to its total area (increasing it to 9,833,517\u00a0km2 (3,796,742\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)).

Likewise, nearly all nations host formal diplomatic missions with the United States, except Iran,[241] North Korea,[242] and Bhutan.[243] Though Taiwan does not have formal diplomatic relations with the U.S., it maintains close unofficial relations.[244] The United States regularly supplies Taiwan with military equipment to deter potential Chinese aggression.[245]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain articles: Americans and Race and ethnicity in the United States\n\nSee also: List of U.S. states by population\n\n![](image)United States population density map based on Census 2010 data\nThe U.S. Census Bureau reported 331,449,281 residents as of April 1, 2020,[m][351] making the United States the third-most populous nation in the world, after China and India.[352] According to the Bureau's U.S. Population Clock, on January\u00a028, 2021, the U.S. population had a net gain of one person every 100 seconds, or about 864 people per day.[353] In 2018, 52% of Americans age 15 and over were married, 6% were widowed, 10% were divorced, and 32% had never been married.[354] In 2021, the total fertility rate for the U.S. stood at 1.7 children per woman,[355] and it had the world's highest rate of children (23%) living in single-parent households in 2019.[356]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGlobally-recognized newspapers in the United States include *The Wall Street Journal*, *The New York Times*, *The Washington Post*, and *USA Today*.[477] More than 800 publications are produced in Spanish, the second most commonly used language in the United States behind English.[478][479] With very few exceptions, all the newspapers in the U.S. are privately owned, either by large chains such as Gannett or McClatchy, which own dozens or even hundreds of newspapers; by small chains that own a handful of papers; or, in a situation that is increasingly rare, by individuals or families.

This reflected the Dutch colonial empire's primary purpose, which was commercial exchange as opposed to sovereignty over homogeneous landmasses.[239] Today, there is some degree of fluency by either educated members of the oldest generation or legal professionals,[240] as specific law codes are still only available in Dutch.[241]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Indonesia\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nIndonesia\u00a0articles\n |\n| --- |\n| History | * Timeline\n* Prehistoric\n* Hinduism-Buddhism era\n* Spread of Islam\n* Portuguese era (1512\u20131605)\n* VOC era (1603\u20131800)\n* French and British era (1806\u20131816)\n* Dutch East Indies (1800\u20131942)\n* Japanese occupation (1942\u201345)\n* National Revolution (1945\u201349)\n* Liberal democracy era (1950\u201359)\n* Guided Democracy (1959\u201365)\n* Transitional period (1965\u201366)\n* New Order (1966\u201398)\n* *Reformasi* (since 1998)\n |\n| Geography | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Borders\n* Cities\n* Climate\n\t+ Climate change\n* Conservation\n\t+ Biosphere reserves\n\t+ National parks\n* Deforestation\n* Earthquakes\n* Environmental issues\n* Geology\n* Islands\n* Lakes\n* Mountains\n* Provincial highest points\n* Natural history\n\t+ Fauna\n\t+ Flora\n* Regions\n* Rivers\n* Volcanoes\n |\n\n |\n| Politics | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n269. **^** \"Indonesia \u2013 Asia\".

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) identified 140 species of mammals as threatened and 15 as critically endangered, including the Bali myna,[116] Sumatran orangutan,[117] and Javan rhinoceros.[118] Some academics describe the deforestation and other environmental destruction in the country as an ecocide.[119][120][121]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n122. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Dwi Harijanti, Susi; Lindsey, Tim (1 January 2006). \"Indonesia: General elections test the amended Constitution and the new Constitutional Court\". *International Journal of Constitutional Law*. **4** (1): 138\u2013150. doi:10.1093/icon/moi055.\n123. **^** Ardiansyah, Fitrian; Marthen, Andri; Amalia, Nur (2015), *Forest and land-use governance in a decentralized Indonesia*, doi:10.17528/cifor/005695\n124. **^** (2002), *The fourth Amendment of 1945 Indonesia Constitution*, Chapter III \u2013 The Executive Power, Article 7.\n125. **^** Chapter II, Article 3, 3rd Clause of the 1945 Constitution.\n126. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"The 1945 Constitution of the Republic of Indonesia\" (PDF).

In 2016, the transport sector generated about 5.2% of GDP.[187]\n\n\nThe road transport system is predominant, with a total length of 542,310 kilometres (336,980 miles) as of 2018[update].[188] Jakarta has the most extended bus rapid transit system globally, boasting 251.2 kilometres (156.1 miles) in 13 corridors and ten cross-corridor routes.[189] Rickshaws such as *bajaj* and *becak* and share taxis such as *Angkot* and *Minibus* are a regular sight in the country.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe first general election was held in 1955 to elect members of the DPR and the Constitutional Assembly (*Konstituante*).

Since then, the president is elected for a five-year term, as are the party-aligned members of the DPR and the non-partisan DPD.[127][122] Beginning with the 2015 local elections, elections for governors and mayors have occurred on the same date.

The MPR comprises two houses; the People's Representative Council (*Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat*, DPR), with 575 members, and the Regional Representative Council (*Dewan Perwakilan Daerah*, DPD), with 136.[127] The DPR passes legislation and monitors the executive branch.

Although relations among the diverse population are mostly harmonious, acute sectarian discontent and violence remain problematic in some areas.[73] A political settlement to an armed separatist conflict in Aceh was achieved in 2005.[74]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n89. **^** \"Indonesia: Climate Risk and Adaptation Country Profile\" (PDF).

The majority of the population in the south resides along the Indus River, with Karachi the most populous commercial city.[475] In the east, west, and north, most of the population lives in an arc formed by the cities of Lahore, Faisalabad, Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Sargodha, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Gujrat, Jhelum, Sheikhupura, Nowshera, Mardan, and Peshawar. During the period 1990\u20132008, city dwellers made up 36% of Pakistan's population, making it the most urbanised nation in South Asia. Furthermore, more than 50% of Pakistanis live in towns of 5,000 people or more.[476] Immigration, from both within and outside the country, is regarded as one of the main factors contributing to urbanisation in Pakistan. One analysis of the 1998 national census highlighted the significance of the partition of India in the 1940s as it relates to urban change in Pakistan.[477]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n535. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Migration and Remittances: Top Countries\" (PDF).

Countries like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan have enough influence to not be considered small, but not enough to be major powers. Within the limits of their regions, they play a significant political role. Thus instinctively, they would qualify as middle powers. While it is not the objective here to question the characteristics of Jordan's definition of middle powers, we argue that Pakistan is in fact a middle power despite its being nuclear-armed. When looking at the numbers, for instance, it appears that Saudi Arabia and Pakistan can be classified as middle powers (see in this regard Ping, 2007).\n30. **^** Iqbal, Anwar (8 November 2015). \"Pakistan an emerging market economy: IMF\". *www.dawn.com*.

The growth rate of services sector is higher than the growth rate of agriculture and industrial sector. Services sector accounts for 54 percent of GDP in 2014 and little over one-third of total employment. Services sector has strong linkages with other sectors of economy; it provides essential inputs to agriculture sector and manufacturing sector.[342] Pakistan's I.T sector is regarded as among the fastest growing sector's in Pakistan. The World Economic Forum, assessing the development of Information and Communication Technology in the country ranked Pakistan 110th among 139 countries on the 'Networked Readiness Index 2016'.[343]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nChristians formed the next largest religious minority after Hindus, with 1.27% of the population following it.[454] The highest concentration of Christians in Pakistan is in Lahore District (5%) in Punjab province and in Islamabad Capital Territory (over 4% Christian). There is a Roman Catholic community in Karachi that was established by Goan and Tamil migrants when Karachi's infrastructure was being developed by the British during the colonial administration between World War I and World War II.[500]\n\n\nAfter Christianity, the largest religion is the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith, which had a following of 30,000 in 2008, followed by Sikhism, Buddhism, and Zoroastrianism, each claiming roughly 20,000 adherents in 2008,[514] and a very small community of Jains.\n\n\nOne of percent of the population identified as atheist in 2005. However, the figure rose to 2.0% in 2012 according to Gallup.[515]\n\n\n\n## Culture and society[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Culture of Pakistan, British heritage of Pakistan, and Public holidays in Pakistan\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThough their sovereignty was in no way impaired by this seemingly ambiguous position they all held the British sovereign as their head of state who was represented in each capital by a governor- general appointed on the advice of the local prime minister.

Pakistan has been termed the 'Saudi Arabia of Coal' by *Forbes*.[330]\nThe structure of the Pakistani economy has changed from a mainly agricultural to a strong service base. Agriculture as of 2015[update] accounts for only 20.9% of the GDP.[331] Even so, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, Pakistan produced 21,591,400 metric tons of wheat in 2005, more than all of Africa (20,304,585 metric tons) and nearly as much as all of South America (24,557,784 metric tons).[332] Majority of the population, directly or indirectly, is dependent on this sector. It accounts for 43.5% of employed labour force and is the largest source of foreign exchange earnings.[331][333]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to the 2017 national census of Pakistan, the country's largest ethnolinguistic groups were the Punjabis (making up 38.8% of the total population), the Pashtuns (18.2%), Sindhis (14.6%), Saraikis (12.19%), Muhajirs (7.08%), and the Balochs (3.02%).[6][457] The remaining population consist of a number of ethnic minorities such as the Brahuis,[458][459] the Hindkowans, the various peoples of Gilgit-Baltistan, the Kashmiris, the Sheedis (who are of African descent),[460] and the Hazaras.[461] There are also scattered speakers of Gujarati in Karachi.[462]\n\n\nThere is also a large Pakistani diaspora worldwide, numbering over seven million,[463] which has been recorded as the sixth largest diaspora in the world.[464]\n\n\n\n### Immigration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Immigration to Pakistan\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Pakistan hosts the second largest refugee population globally after Turkey.[465] An Afghan refugee girl near Tarbela Dam.\nEven after partition in 1947, Indian Muslims continued to migrate to Pakistan throughout the 1950s and 1960s, and these migrants settled mainly in Karachi and other towns of Sindh province.[466] The wars in neighboring Afghanistan during the 1980s and 1990s also forced millions of Afghan refugees into Pakistan. The Pakistan census excludes the 1.41\u00a0million registered refugees from Afghanistan,[467] who are found mainly in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and tribal belt, with small numbers residing in Karachi and Quetta. Pakistan is home to one of the world's largest refugee populations.[468] In addition to Afghans, around 2\u00a0million Bangladeshis and half a million other undocumented people live in Pakistan. They are claimed to be from other areas such as Myanmar, Iran, Iraq, and Africa.[469]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Hindu temples\n* Libraries\n* Mausolea and shrines\n* Mosques\n* Museums\n* Parks\n* Stadiums\n* World Heritage Sites\n* Zoos\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| * Basic topics\n* ![](image) Category\n* ![](image) Portal\n |\n\n| Links to related articles\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nList of Districts of Pakistan\n |\n| --- |\n| * Districts by Human Development Index\n |\n| \n\n| List of districts in Balochistan\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Qalat | * Awaran\n* Kalat\n* Khuzdar\n* Lasbela\n* Mastung\n* Shaheed Sikandarabad\n | ![Districts of Balochistan](image)\n |\n| Makran | * Gwadar\n* Kech\n* Panjgur\n* Mand\n |\n| Nasirabad | * Jafarabad\n* Jhal Magsi\n* Kachhi\n* Nasirabad\n* Sohbatpur\n |\n| Quetta | * Killa Abdullah\n* Pishin\n* Quetta\n |\n| Sibi | * Dera Bugti\n* Harnai\n* Kohlu\n* Lehri\n* Sibi\n* Ziarat\n |\n| Zhob | * Killa Saifullah\n* Sherani\n* Zhob\n |\n| Rakhshan | * Chagai\n* Kharan\n* Nushki\n* Washuk\n* Chaman\n |\n| Loralai | * Barkhan\n* Duki\n* Loralai\n* Musakhel\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Bannu | * Bannu\n* Lakki Marwat\n* North Waziristan\n | ![Districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa](image)\n |\n| Dera Ismail Khan | * Dera Ismail Khan\n* Upper South Waziristan\n* Lower South Waziristan\n* Tank\n |\n| Hazara | * Abbottabad\n* Battagram\n* Haripur\n* Kolai-Palas\n* Lower Kohistan\n* Mansehra\n* Torghar\n* Upper Kohistan\n |\n| Kohat | * Hangu\n* Karak\n* Kohat\n* Kurram\n* Orakzai\n |\n| Malakand | * Bajaur\n* Buner\n* Lower Chitral\n* Lower Dir\n* Malakand\n* Shangla\n* Swat\n* Upper Chitral\n* Upper Dir\n |\n| Mardan | * Mardan\n* Swabi\n |\n| Peshawar | * Charsadda\n* Khyber\n* Mohmand\n* Nowshera\n* Peshawar\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Districts of Punjab\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ![](image)\u00a0Syria\n |\n| See also | * Member states\n* Three Evils\n* SCO Interbank Consortium\n* Eurasian Land Bridge\n* Working languages\n\t+ Chinese\n\t+ Russian\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nOrganisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC)\n |\n| --- |\n| * Secretary-General of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation: Hissein Brahim Taha\n |\n| Member states | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n437. **^** Multiple Indication Cluster Survey (MICS): Federally Administered Tribal Area (FATA) of Pakistan (PDF) (Report).
