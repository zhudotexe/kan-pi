There have been 14 Presidents of Cornell University, not including three interregnum presidencies during university presidential transitions.\n\n\nNew York's only land-grant university, Cornell University was founded in 1865 by Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White and has its main campus in Ithaca, New York, as well as two newer satellite medical campuses in New York City and Qatar. Cornell joined the newly formed Ivy League in 1954 and is the only land-grant institution within it.\n\n\n\n\n## List of presidents[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| №\n | President\n | Term of office\n | Education\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | ![](image) | **Andrew Dickson White**(1832–1918)[1] | 1866 – 1885(19 years) | * A.B., Yale College (1853)\n* M.A., Yale College\n | White was the co-founder of Cornell University, along with Ezra Cornell, and introduced the bill in the New York State Senate establishing Cornell University.

Built in 1756, the John Maclean House, also known as the President's House, was where the president lived until Prospect House was acquired in 1878.[16] In 1968, the official residence switched again to Walter Lowrie House.[17] The Office of the President is housed in Nassau Hall.[18]\n\n\n\n\n## Presidents[edit]\n\n\n\n\nList of presidents\n| No. | President\n | Presidency\n | Notes\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![Portrait of Jonathan Dickinson](image) | Jonathan Dickinson | 1747\n | Died shortly after entering office from a pleuritic illness[19] | [6] |\n| 2\n | ![Portrait of Aaron Burr, Sr.](image) | Aaron Burr Sr. | 1748–1757[b] | Minister of the Presbyterian Church of Newark.[21] Father of Aaron Burr, the third Vice President of the United States.[22] Died from illness while in office.[23] | [6] |\n| –\n | ![Seal of Princeton University](image) | David Cowell | 1757-1758\n | Served as acting president.[11] | [11] |\n| 3\n | ![Portrait of Jonathan Edwards](image) | Jonathan Edwards | 1758\n | Eminent theologian to the First Great Awakening.[24][25] Died five weeks into office after a fever from a smallpox vaccine.[26] | [6] |\n| –\n | ![Seal of Princeton University](image) | Jacob Green | 1758–1759\n | Delegate for Morris County to the Provincial Congress of New Jersey.[27] Father of Ashbel Green, 8th president of the university.[28][27] Served as acting president.[6] | [6] |\n| 4\n | ![Portrait of Samuel Davies](image) | Samuel Davies | 1759–1761\n | Died shortly after entering office from pneumonia[29] | [6] |\n| 5\n | ![Portrait of Samuel Finley](image) | Samuel Finley | 1761–1766\n | Founder of West Nottingham Academy;[30][31] Minister of the Cold Spring Presbyterian Church.[32] Graduate of the Log College.[33] Died while in office in Philadelphia seeking medical treatment.[34] | [6] |\n| –\n | ![Seal of Princeton University](image) | John Blair | 1767–1768\n | Graduate of the Log College.[33] Served as acting president.[6] | [6] |\n| 6\n | ![Portrait of John Witherspoon](image) | John Witherspoon | 1768–1794\n | Signer of the Declaration of Independence; Delegate to the Second Continental Congress; Moderator of the first General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America.[35] Died while in office.[36] | [6] |\n| 7\n | ![Portrait of Samuel S.

Built in 1756, the John Maclean House, also known as the President's House, was where the president lived until Prospect House was acquired in 1878.[16] In 1968, the official residence switched again to Walter Lowrie House.[17] The Office of the President is housed in Nassau Hall.[18]\n\n\n\n\n## Presidents[edit]\n\n\n\n\nList of presidents\n| No. | President\n | Presidency\n | Notes\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![Portrait of Jonathan Dickinson](image) | Jonathan Dickinson | 1747\n | Died shortly after entering office from a pleuritic illness[19] | [6] |\n| 2\n | ![Portrait of Aaron Burr, Sr.](image) | Aaron Burr Sr. | 1748–1757[b] | Minister of the Presbyterian Church of Newark.[21] Father of Aaron Burr, the third Vice President of the United States.[22] Died from illness while in office.[23] | [6] |\n| –\n | ![Seal of Princeton University](image) | David Cowell | 1757-1758\n | Served as acting president.[11] | [11] |\n| 3\n | ![Portrait of Jonathan Edwards](image) | Jonathan Edwards | 1758\n | Eminent theologian to the First Great Awakening.[24][25] Died five weeks into office after a fever from a smallpox vaccine.[26] | [6] |\n| –\n | ![Seal of Princeton University](image) | Jacob Green | 1758–1759\n | Delegate for Morris County to the Provincial Congress of New Jersey.[27] Father of Ashbel Green, 8th president of the university.[28][27] Served as acting president.[6] | [6] |\n| 4\n | ![Portrait of Samuel Davies](image) | Samuel Davies | 1759–1761\n | Died shortly after entering office from pneumonia[29] | [6] |\n| 5\n | ![Portrait of Samuel Finley](image) | Samuel Finley | 1761–1766\n | Founder of West Nottingham Academy;[30][31] Minister of the Cold Spring Presbyterian Church.[32] Graduate of the Log College.[33] Died while in office in Philadelphia seeking medical treatment.[34] | [6] |\n| –\n | ![Seal of Princeton University](image) | John Blair | 1767–1768\n | Graduate of the Log College.[33] Served as acting president.[6] | [6] |\n| 6\n | ![Portrait of John Witherspoon](image) | John Witherspoon | 1768–1794\n | Signer of the Declaration of Independence; Delegate to the Second Continental Congress; Moderator of the first General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America.[35] Died while in office.[36] | [6] |\n| 7\n | ![Portrait of Samuel S.
