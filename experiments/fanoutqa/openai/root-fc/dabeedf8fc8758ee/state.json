Listings for *Economics* refer to the related Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. The Nobel Prizes and the Prize in Economic Sciences have been awarded 567 times to 889 recipients, of which 26 awards (all Peace Prizes) were to organizations. Due to some recipients receiving multiple awards, the total number of recipients is 860 individuals and 22 organizations.[1]\n\n\nThe present list ranks laureates under the country/countries that are stated by the Nobel Prize committee on its website.[2] The list does not distinguish between laureates who received a full prize and the majority who shared a prize.[3] Some laureates are listed under more than one country, because the official website mentions multiple countries in relation to the laureate.[4] If a country is merely mentioned as the place of birth, an asterisk (\\*) is used in the respective listing to indicate this.[5] In this case, the birth country is mentioned in *italics* at the other listings of this laureate.\n\n\nOrganizations are listed here if the Nobel Prize committee relates them to a single country.[6]\n\n\n\n## Summary[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

In the cohort-component method, the components of population change (fertility, mortality, and net migration) are projected separately for each birth cohort (persons born in a given year). The base population is advanced each year by using projected survival rates and net international migration. Each year, a new birth cohort is added to the population by applying the projected fertility rates to the female population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2021, the population of the United States grew at a slower rate than in any other year since the country's founding.[77] The U.S. population grew only 0.1% from the previous year before.[77] The United States' population has grown by less than one million people for the first time since 1937, with the lowest numeric growth since at least 1900, when the Census Bureau began yearly population estimates.[77] Apart from the previous few years, when population growth plummeted to historically low levels, the slowest pace of increase in the twentieth century occurred between 1918 and 1919, when the influenza epidemic and World War I were both in full swing.[77] Slower population growth has been the norm in the United States for some years, owing to lower fertility and net international migration, as well as rising mortality from an aging population.[77]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n110. **^** Resident Population Data. \"Resident Population Data \u2013 2010 Census\". *U.S. Census Bureau*.

Growth in the Hispanic and Asian populations is predicted to almost triple over the next 40 years. By 2055, the breakdown is estimated to be 48% non-Hispanic white, 24% Hispanic, 16% Black, and 14% Asian.[174]\n\n\nAs of 2015[update], 14% of the United States' population is foreign born, compared to just 5% in 1965. Nearly 39\u00a0million immigrants have come to the U.S. since 1965, with most coming from Asia and Latin America. The 2015 Census Report predicts that the percentage of the U.S. population that is foreign-born will continue to increase, reaching 19% by 2060. This increase in the foreign-born population will account for a large share of the overall population growth.[174]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nStates in the United States by Catholic population according to the Pew Research Center 2014 Religious Landscape Survey.[211] States with Catholic population greater than the United States as a whole are in full red.\n* ![States in the United States by Evangelical Protestant population according to the Pew Research Center 2014 Religious Landscape Survey.[211] States with Evangelical Protestant populations greater than the United States as a whole are in full orange.](image)\n\nStates in the United States by Evangelical Protestant population according to the Pew Research Center 2014 Religious Landscape Survey.[211] States with Evangelical Protestant populations greater than the United States as a whole are in full orange.\n\n\n* ![States in the United States by Mainline or Black Protestant population according to the Pew Research Center 2014 Religious Landscape Survey.[211] States with Mainline or Black Protestant population greater than the United States as a whole are in full purple.](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe U.S. total fertility rate as of 2020 is 1.641[41]\n\n\n\n* 1.55 for non-Hispanic whites[41]\n* 1.71 for non-Hispanic Blacks[41]\n* 1.65 for Native Americans (including Hispanics)\n* 1.53 for Asian Americans (including Hispanics)\n\n\nOther:[60]\n\n\n\n* 1.88 for *Hispanics* (of all racial groups)[41]\n\n\n(**Note** that \u224895% of Hispanics are included as \"white Hispanics\" by CDC, which does not recognize the Census's \"Some other race\" category and counts people in that category as white.)\n\n\nSource: National Vital statistics report based on 2010 US Census data[129]\n\n\n\n#### Total Fertility Rates from 1800 to 2010[edit]\n\n\nThe total fertility rate is the number of children born per woman.

If this current growth rate continues, by 2050, around 51% of Americans will not have a religion.[180]\n\n\nSurveys conducted in 2014 and 2019 by Pew indicated that the percentage of Americans unaffiliated with a religion increased from 16% in 2007 to 23% in 2014 and 26% of the population in 2019.[181][182]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNew York: 2.21%, New Jersey: 1.7%, Wisconsin: 1.04%, Arkansas: 1.02%, Montana: 0.86%, Ohio: 0.85%, Iowa: 0.84%, Pennsylvania: 0.82%, Kansas: 0.76%, Kentucky: 0.76%, Utah: 0.75%, Minnesota: 0.75%, Indiana: 0.72%, Wyoming: 0.72%, Mississippi: 0.7%, Michigan: 0.7%, Idaho 0.65%, West Virginia: 0.64%, Arizona: 0.62%, North Dakota 0.59%, South Dakota 0.54%, Arkansas 0.51%, New Mexico: 0.50%, Maryland: 0.49%, Oregon: 0.46%, Michigan: 0.44%, Oklahoma: 0.44%, Florida: 0.43%, Tennessee: 0.42%, Virginia: 0.41%, Illinois: 0.40%, Nevada: 0.40%, West Virginia: 0.39%, Delaware: 0.38%, Georgia: 0.36%, Nebraska: 0.36%, Texas: 0.33%, Alabama: 0.33%, Missouri: 0.32%, Vermont: 0.31%, South Carolina: 0.30%, California: 0.29%, Colorado: 0.29%, North Carolina: 0.25%, Alaska: 0.25%, Connecticut: 0.20%, New Hampshire: 0.19%, Massachusetts: 0.17%.\n\n\n\n### Immigration[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Race\n | Median age (both sexes) (years)\n | Median age (male) (years)\n | Median age (female) (years)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| White\n | 39.8\n | 38.9\n | 40.8\n |\n| Black or African American\n | 32.7\n | 31.2\n | 34.2\n |\n| American Indian and Alaska Native\n | 31.6\n | 30.9\n | 32.2\n |\n| Asian\n | 35.4\n | 34.1\n | 36.6\n |\n| Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander\n | 29.8\n | 29.3\n | 30.3\n |\n| White (Non-Hispanic)\n | 42.8\n | 41.7\n | 44.0\n |\n\n\n\n\n**Most common age by race/ethnicity, 2018**[149]\n| Race/ethnicity | White | Black orAfrican American | Hispanic | Asian | American Indian andAlaska Native | Native Hawaiian andPacific Islander | Multiracial\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Most common age | 58 yo | 27 yo | 11 yo | 29 yo | 26 yo | 28 yo | 3 yo\n |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOf the nation's children in 2050, 62% are expected to be of a minority ethnicity, up from 44% today. Approximately 39% are projected to be Hispanic or Latino (up from 22% in 2008), and 38% are projected to be single-race, non-Hispanic Whites (down from 56% in 2008).[171] Racial and ethnic minorities surpassed non-Hispanic whites as the largest group of U.S. children under 5 years old in 2015.[172]\n\n\nThe fastest growing racial group in America is Asian Americans with a growth rate of 35%, however the multi-racial mixed Asian group is growing even faster, with a growth rate of 55%.

2021, a 1% increase from 2020. Additionally, researchers also looked at births by race and found that White and Hispanic women each saw the number of births increase by about 2% from 2020 to 2021. Meanwhile, Black and Asian women saw the number of births decline by 2.4% and 2.5%, respectively, over the same period, while American Indian/Alaskan Native women saw their numbers fall by 3.2%.[54] It also marks the first rise in births since 2014. Prior to this report, the total number of births had been decreasing by an average of 2% per year.[54] However, the total fertility rate (the number of births a hypothetical group of 1,000 people would have over their lifetimes) was 1,663.5 births per 1,000 women. This is still below the replacement level, the level a population needs to replace itself, which is 2,100 births per 1,000 women.[54]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n237. **^** Miller, Jon D. \"The Generation X Report: Active, Balanced, and Happy: These Young Americans are not bowling alone\" (PDF). *University of Michigan, Longitudinal Study of American Youth, funded by the National Science Foundation*.

Since the 2000 census, Congress has authorized people to identify themselves according to more than one racial classification by selecting more than one category. Only one ethnicity may be selected, however, because the Census Bureau recognizes only two ethnicities\u00a0\u2013 Hispanic and Non-Hispanic\u00a0\u2013 which are mutually exclusive since you can be one or the other, but not both.

Although post-peak births (such as trailing edge boomers) are in decline, and sometimes referred to as a \"bust\", there are still a *relatively* large number of births. The dearth-in-birth bust cohorts include those up to the valley birth year, and those including and beyond, leading up to the subsequent normal birth rate. The baby boom began around 1943 to 1946.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSocial classes in the United States lack distinct boundaries and may overlap.

It is the 21st most populated country in the world and has a population density of 270 people\u00a0per square kilometre (700 people/sq\u00a0mi), with England having significantly greater density than Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland.[3] Almost a third of the population lives in south east England, which is predominantly urban and suburban, with about 9 million in the capital city, London, whose population density is just over 5,200 per square kilometre (13,468 per sq mi).[4]\n\n\nThe population of the UK has undergone demographic transition\u2014that is, the transition from a (typically) pre-industrial population, with high birth and mortality rates and slow population growth, through a stage of falling mortality and faster rates of population growth, to a stage of low birth and mortality rates with, again, lower rates of growth. This growth through 'natural change' has been accompanied in the past two decades by growth through net immigration into the United Kingdom, which since 1999 has exceeded natural change.[5]\n\n\nThe United Kingdom's high literacy rate (99% at age 15 and above)[6] is attributable to universal state education, introduced at the primary level in 1870 (Scotland 1872, free 1890[7]) and at the secondary level in 1900. Parents are obliged to have their children educated from the ages of 5 to 16 years. In England, 16-17 year olds should remain in education, employment or training (for example, in the form of A-Levels, vocational training, and apprenticeships), until the age of 18.[8]\n\n\nThe United Kingdom's population is predominantly White British (81.88% at the 2011 Census), but due to migration from Commonwealth nations, Britain has become ethnically diverse. The second and third largest non-white racial groups are Asian British at 7% of the population, followed by Black British people at 3%.\n\n\nThe main language of the country is British English. Some Celtic languages, namely Scottish Gaelic and Irish, are still spoken by minorities in Scotland and Northern Ireland, respectively, and Cornish has been revived to a limited degree in Cornwall; but the predominant language in all these areas is English. Welsh is widely spoken as a first language in parts of North and West Wales, and to lesser extent in South East Wales, where English is the dominant first language.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Before the census, 200\u20131800[edit]\n\n\nRoman Britain had an estimated population between 2.8\u00a0million and 3 million at the end of the second century AD. At the end of the fourth century, it had an estimated population of 3.6\u00a0million, of whom 125,000 consisted of the Roman army and their families and dependents.[9] The urban population of Roman Britain was about 240,000 people at the end of the fourth century.[9] Roman Britain's capital city, Londinium, is estimated to have had a population of about 60,000.[10][11]\n\n\nFollowing the Roman withdrawal from Britain, Germanic tribes from continental Europe such as the Angles, Saxons and Jutes began a period of significant migration to the southeastern part of the island, notably bringing their language, Old English.[12] Nevertheless, the overall population is believed to have fallen precipitously due to political upheavals and plagues.[13][14] By the time of the compilation of the Domesday Book in the eleventh century, there may have between 1.25 and 2 million people living in England.[15] Though the Domesday Book did not count the English population, it has been regarded as one of the first attempts to produce a census of the country.[16]\n\n\nBetween the years of 1086 and 1750, the English population fluctuated in size due to civil war, famines and plagues.[5] By the end of the 13th century, the population was estimated to have reached between four and six million people, but a combination of factors such as widespread famine and disease in the following century collapsed the population dramatically. An agricultural crisis in 1315 to 1322 and the Black Death in 1348 to 1350 collapsed the population by over a third of its pre-existing number, and the growth rate.[5] By 1377, the population was estimated on a poll-tax of all people aged 14 and over, depending on the population amount of those under 14, to be around 2.2\u00a0million to 3.1\u00a0million.[5]\n\n\nPeriods of instability over the 15th century such as the War of the Roses caused the population to, while grow, increase at a slowed pace.[5] The general factors behind the slow increase was a high mortality rate due to war, less marriages within the population and late marriages, keeping fertility levels lower than they should have been for the time and a net emigration of English people out of the country.[5] However, in contrast to the preceding century, by the 16th century, this situation has elevated itself due to political stability under the Tudor monarchy and little civil unrest which would have resulted in a higher mortality rate.[5] While this was overturned with the English Civil War in 17th century, it allowed the population to grow at a faster pace, causing the population of England to reach a pre-collapse total of 5.74\u00a0million by 1750.[5] In Scotland, population growth was not to the same extent as it was in England, which resulted in being significantly lower in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, which is often ascribed to similar factors halting it such as a high mortality rate, especially for infants, and later marriage and childbearing patterns.[5] Ireland on the other hand before the 19th century consistently had rapid population growth, which has been ascribed to higher fertility rates and earlier marriage than England. Furthermore, the Plantation of Ulster in the 17th century also affected the population total of Scotland with an estimated 100,000 Scots migrating to Ulster, additionally, the Jacobite rebellion in 1745 also caused significant emigration.[5] The estimated population total of Scotland in 1691 was 1.23\u00a0million.[5]\n\n\nThe impetus to collect population data was reinforced due to food supply concerns and war against France in the late 18th century and the beginning of the early 19th century.[5] In 1800, the Census Act was passed, authorising the first modern census in British history to be conducted.[5]\n\n\n\n### Census established and the demographic transition, 1800 \u2013 2000[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Population development of the UK since 1800The first Census in 1801 revealed that the population of Great Britain was 10.5\u00a0million.[17] Of this, England's population had grown to 8.3\u00a0million, Wales population rested at 0.6\u00a0million while Scotland had a population of 1.6\u00a0million.[5] In Ireland, the population rested at an estimate of between 4.5 and 5.5\u00a0million inhabitants.[18][19] Since 1801, a census has been conducted every decade, in Ireland this was conducted for the first time in 1821.[5]\n\n\nDuring the Industrial Revolution, the demographic transition started to occur within the United Kingdom, going from a pre-industrial society demographically to one of an industrialised society. By 1841 Census, the population of England and Wales rested at 15.9\u00a0million,[5][20] doubling in the space of 40 years, for Ireland 8.2\u00a0million[5][20][21] and for Scotland 2.6\u00a0million.[5][20] This slowed rate of growth for Scotland may be attributed to higher net emigration of Scottish people out of the nation, and two typhus epidemics in 1837 and 1847.[5]\n\n\nFactors often associated with the beginning of the demographic transition began to change dramatically as well, which contributed to the rapid increase. For example, Child mortality decreased dramatically, the proportion of children born in London who died before the age of five decreased from 74.5 per thousand in 1730\u20131749 to 31.8 per thousand in 1810\u20131829.[22] General mortality was thought to have declined as well, especially after 1850 as well as an increased birth rate caused the English population to sustain itself in the second phase of the transition from 1750 to 1870.[5]\n\n\nDue to this, in the second half of the 19th century the population of England continued to grow quickly from 16.8\u00a0million in 1851 to 30.5\u00a0million in 1901.[5] This rapid growth was also seen in the other constituent nations. In Wales, the population increased from 0.6\u00a0million in 1801 to 2 million in 1901, in Scotland, the population increased from 1.6\u00a0million to 4.5\u00a0million in 1901. In contrast however and due to the Great Irish Famine, which began in the 1840s, caused the deaths of 1 million Irish people, and caused well over a million to emigrate.[5][23] Mass emigration became entrenched as a result of the famine, and Ireland's population decreased rapidly, from 8.2\u00a0million in 1841 to 3.2\u00a0million in 1901.[5][24] However this massive population collapse did not effect Northern Ireland to the same extent, due to being more industrialised and urbanised and while the population did decline, it had recovered itself by the beginning of the 20th century.[5] This prolonged period of emigration and net population decline in Irish history was only reversed by the middle of the 20th century.[24]\n\n\nBy the 1870s, the total fertility rate of the UK population declined from 4.88 children per woman in 1871, to 2.4 by 1921, representing a transition to the third stage of the demographic transition.[5] Traditional means of birth control were used such as abstinence and withdrawal facilitated the collapse of the birth rate,[5] this was also hastened by the 1930s by more modern methods of contraception which were beginning to be used with increased acceptance.[5] From 1840 to 1930 there was a net emigration of English people out of the country which resulted in the population being stunted in the capacity it could have grown to.[5]\n\n\nDuring the first half of the 20th century, the United Kingdom began to approach the 4th stage of the demographic transition.[5] The end of the First World War and the loss of lives of troops, coupled with an influenza outbreak is estimated to have caused the death of upwards of 900,000 people in the United Kingdom.[5] This as a consequence shrunk the male population of the Lost Generation and altered the sex ratio, which slowed the growth rate of the population down.[5] By the end of the Second World War, this transition had been completed and the society had a low but fluctuating birth rate, a low death rate and a slowed growth rate of the population.[5] In 1948, the British Nationality Act was signed which allowed the access of the peoples of the British Empire's colonies to migrate to the country being classed in nationality as the same as a native of the United Kingdom. This law, while an unintentional side-effect, led to the start of modern immigration to the United Kingdom.\n\n\nThe move into the 4th stage also took place during major social change in the United Kingdom throughout the 1960s.[5] Liberalisation of society during the decade led to the 1967 Abortion Act which legalised abortion in the United Kingdom for the first time, and the 1969 Divorce Reform Act, which liberalised the circumstances under which someone can get a divorce.[5] Between these years, the population fluctuated; from the 1950s onwards the population increased through natural growth but by the time of the mid-1970s the population decreased due to emigration, which took net migration to a negative, and deaths exceeding births.[5] For the first time in 1973, the birth rate of the country fell below replacement level, due to the previous liberalising acts.[25] By the 1980s, the decline of population growth had recovered to an extent due to a reversal of net emigration.[5]\n\n\nIn the 1990s, international migration began to contribute more proportionally to population growth,[5] and by 1998 this had passed natural increase as the main provider of growth.[5] Liberalisation of immigration rules under the new government allowed rapid increase of the number of migrants arriving, quadrupling the number from a net migration rate of 50,000 a year, to 200,000 a year.[26]\n\n\n\n### Modern century, 2000\u2013present[edit]\n\n\nBy the beginning of the 21st century, the population of the United Kingdom rested at a total of 59,113,000 people. In each constituent nation, the population of England was 49,449,700, Scotland had a population of 5,064,200, Wales had a population of 2,910,200 and Northern Ireland a population of 1,689,300.[5] Increased international migration which began to rapidly increase at the end of the 20th century also has brought increased ethnic heterogenization to the British population, not only in ethnicity and race, but also in country of birth. In 2001, the White British population was registered to be 88.52% of the total population, but by 2011, this proportion of the population had dropped to 81.88%, with other ethnic groups either rising by 50% of their respective total population in 2001 or doubling entirely.\n\n\nSuch rapid immigration growth boosted population growth in the United Kingdom. In 2011, the population sat at around 63 million people.\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Countries of the United Kingdom by population, List of cities in the United Kingdom \u00a7\u00a0List of cities, and List of urban areas in the United Kingdom\n\n![](image)Total number of registered deaths over time\nThe population of the UK in the last recorded census in 2011 was 63 million, of whom 31\u00a0million were male and 32\u00a0million female.

The GAD produced population projections every year from 1955 to 1979 and then switched it to every 2 years up to 1991. The Office for National Statistics took control of producing population projections for the country in 2006.[35]\n\n\nThe British Office for National Statistics' 2016-based National Population Projections indicated that, if recent trends continue, the UK's population would increase by 3.6\u00a0million between mid-2016 and mid-2026. This represents an average annual growth rate of 0.5%. Over the same period, the population of England is projected to grow by 5.9%; for Wales, this figure is 3.1%, while for Scotland and Northern Ireland the figures are 3.2% and 4.2% respectively. These projections did not allow for any possible effects of the UK leaving the European Union.[36]\n\n\n\n### Fertility[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Total fertility rate of the United Kingdom from 1541 to 2019\n![](image)Total fertility rate of the United Kingdom across local authorities in 20211 to 1.4\n1.4 to 1.7\n1.7 to 1.9\n1.9 to 2.1\n2.1+\n\nSince 1838, it has been compulsory to register a birth or death in the United Kingdom.[37]\n\n\nFirst official data on the fertility rate of the country was first made available in 1938,[37] However estimates of the total fertility rate (TFR) can be made back all the way till 1541.[38]\n\n\nThe fertility rate of the country before the 19th century maintained itself at an average of around 5 children per woman. This fertility rate within the United Kingdom has been falling since 1870, when the country began into transition into the 3rd stage of the demographic transition.[39][37][25][40][41] This transition represents the change in reproductive strategy from how many children a mother 'needs' to more of how many she 'wants' and a substitution of quality over quantity in the offspring produced.[42][43] From the 1880s onwards, the birth rate began to decline rapidly from the levels it had previous sustained itself at.[43] In England this crude birth rate decline represented a 44% decrease over a period from 1875 to 1920.[43]\n\n\nA number of factors have been argued to have contributed to this ranging from four broad spectrums of biological, technological changes and developments in the society, socio-economic reasons and cultural considerations.[40] In the context of the Industrial Revolution, a large number of socio-economic developments occurred; large scale urbanisation of the population caused mass internal movements of people to high density population centres, income per capita of citizens rose significantly especially in the last half of the 19th century, coupled with large scale economic growth improved the livelihoods of the working and middle classes of the United Kingdom, this growth in the standard of living led also to the collapse of mortality rates, which had been in decline since the early 18th century and more especially the infant mortality.[41][43][40] This development came about with the decline of child labour at the same time as well which meant there was less of a need for a quantity of children to uphold the household economically,[41][43][40] educational quality of the country rose during the same time period which meant that children held more economical potential through educated labour means.[40]\n\n\nThe decline and equalling out of the gender gap in terms of place in the workforce meant that women were beginning in the 19th century to become a larger part of the workforce which also contributed to the birth rate decline.[41][43][40]\n\n\nImprovements in public diets and nutritional quality increases, which are linked to biological factors such as a decline in lactation, have also been included as a potential factor in the decline of the fertility rate.[40] Technological developments within the society also began to have an effect; contraceptive use become somewhat usable on a mass scale in the latter half of the 19th century due to technological developments in the production of rubber.[40] Abortion, while illegal during the 19th century, was also used by women, however to what extent at the time is unknown.[40]\n\n\nCultural considerations such as decline in religious adherence (albeit little data on this matter during the 19th century) have also been considered as reasons.[40] While these factors altogether are debated by demographers as to which were more important than each other, it is generally accepted that due to these factors overall, mothers could begin to invest more time and nurture 'quality' into their offspring rather than having an increased 'quantity' of children that were needed in the past for various such reasons, and that this development led to the decrease of the total fertility rate.[42]\n\n\nBy 1914, the birthrate sat at around 2.88 children per woman, however by 1918 had collapsed proportionally by almost 50%[44] due to World War One and sank to 2.03 children.[45][38] In the post-World War One period, while the birthrate of the country boomed at the very end of the war reaching a peak of 3.08 children in 1920,[45] this began to endure a rapid decline and had slumped to historic lows by the 1930s, for the first time in the country's history falling below a replacement level fertility rate.[37][25] This did not recover in-till the end of the Second World War in 1945.\n\n\nIn the post-World War Two period, the fertility rate of the country boomed once again, bringing itself out of the below replacement level in the 1930s to levels not seen since the late 19th century. This peaked in 1964, with a TFR of 2.95.[46][47] However, by 1973, the fertility rate of the country collapsed again below replacement, and has not since in the present day reached a replacement level again.[37] However population issues such as the sub-replacement level fertility rate have often been categorised as something in which the government does not view as a major issue.[25] Little incentives were made and have been made to increase the birth rate throughout the UK's post war period.[25] However compared to other countries in continental Western European standards, the United Kingdom managed to retain a seemingly 'high' fertility rate.[25]\n\n\nFamily planning policies were enacted during the 1970s due to concerns of rapid population growth during the 1960s.[25] The 1973 NHS Reorganisation Act is an example of such policies, within this act family planning advice and supplies were first issued to the public.[25] Over this time period, with previous liberalising acts such as the Abortion Act and the Divorce Reform Act, and scientific developments such as increased access to contraceptive methods to reduce pregnancies, such as the contraceptive pill, it is generally ascribed that these social changes were the major contributors to the decline of the fertility rate below replacement level in the latter half of the 20th century.[25] With these changes also, pre-marital conceptions fell to 1950 levels by the late 1970s.[25] This pattern of decline of the birth rate is similar to other European countries.[25]\n\n\n\nThe government's position was further presented and then re-iterated in 1984 at the UN Conference on Population in Mexico;\n\n\n> The United Kingdom('s) government does not pursue a population policy in the sense of actively trying to influence the overall size of the population, its age-structure, or the components of change except in the field of immigration. Nor has it expressed a view about the size of population, or the age-structure, that would be desirable. ...The current level of births has not been the cause of general anxiety. The prevailing view is that decisions about fertility and childbearing are for people themselves to make, but that it is proper for government to provide individuals with the information and the means necessary to make their decisions effective. To this end, the government provides assistance with family planning as part of the National Health Service. The \u2018ageing\u2019 of the population does raise social and economic issues. However, it is believed that these will prove manageable; and also, to a degree, that society will adapt....\u2019[25] \n> \n> \n\nIn 2003, Right to Request was setup which allowed the parents of small children to request flexible working times which included shorter working hours for parents to care for their children.[25] However, although a majority of requests for Right to Request are accepted, a report in 2006 found that its impact was negligible as mothers tended to switch employers to get reduced hours regardless.[25]\n\n\nDue to migration beginning in the late 90s and especially during the 2000s lead to the overall total fertility rate of the country to rise by 0.1 in the period of 2004 to 2011.[25]\n\n\nIn 2012, the UK's total fertility rate (TFR) was 1.92 children per woman,[48] below the replacement rate, which in the UK is 2.075.[49] In 2001, the TFR was at a record low of 1.63, but it then increased every year until it reached a peak of 1.96 in 2008, before decreasing again.[48] In 2012 and 2013, England and Wales's TFR decreased to 1.85.[48][50] In Scotland however TFR is lower: it decreased from 1.75 in 2010 to 1.67 in 2012.[48] Northern Ireland has the highest TFR in the UK, standing at 2.02 in 2010 and 2.03 in 2012.[48]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

when a mother gives birth for the first time was in 1920.[37]\n\n\nThe reduction of the total fertility rate of the United Kingdom has also had an effect on the mean age in which a mother gives birth to her first child.[46]\n\n\nThe age in which a mother gives birth to her first child has changed depending on the time period, but since the 1970s the age in which someone gives birth has been trending upwards.[46]\n\n\n\n\n\nMean age of childbearing[37][46]\n| Year\n | Mean age of childbearing\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1920\n | 25.6\n |\n| 1941\n | 23.8\n |\n| 1959\n | 25.7\n |\n| 1960\n |

of the fertility rate has also had an effect on the general family size of mothers in the United Kingdom, with the two being interlinked with each other.[46] The family size of the average UK family can be estimated with a completed family size (CFS), which is an estimate of the amount of children a woman has birthed by the end of her childbearing years.[37]\n\n\nFamily size within the UK has shifted towards two or one children in recent decades, rather than in the past when larger family sizes were more prominent and sought after.[46] This pattern is similar to other European countries, where couples are having fewer children.[46] Increasingly, there are also more couples who are completely childless; this has been increasing since the 1950s.[46][51]\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment of family

since 1960 by gender\nLife expectancy has increased in the United Kingdom since the 18th century due to the Industrial Revolution and then the Second Industrial Revolution which has vastly increased quality of life of the country's citizens.\n\n\nAt the start of the 20th century, the life expectancy at birth was only 45.6 years.[52]\n\n\nBy 1950, life expectancy at birth had risen to 68.6 years.[52] During the latter half of the century, further factors influenced the increase of life expectancy: diseases and the improvement of healthcare in the 1950s, decline in smoking in the mid-1970s and improvements in treating heart disease in the 1990s contributed to its decline.[53]\n\n\nAt the start of the 21st century, the life expectancy at birth was 77.8 years.[52]\n\n\nIn 2011 the life expectancy at birth of the UK was around 80.4 years,[52] but the rate of increase has been stalling.[53][54][55] Potential factors behind this may be austerity measures imposed in the beginning of the 2010s,[55][56] which coincidentally since then mortality rates have slowed down in decline[57] or older people dying off at faster rates than expected.[57] On the topic of austerity measures, Professor Richard Faragher has said that \"It is possible to have high or rising life expectancy during austerity, as is the case in Japan. Similarly, you can have rising life expectancy despite high levels of inequality \u2013 this was the case in Britain from 1900-1950.\"[57] but noted that austerity measures to social services like the NHS, especially social care support for the elderly may be causing a stalling of life expectancy increase due to a decreased quality of life for older generations.[55][57]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Life expectancy

mortality trends since 1960\nInfant mortality has been on the decline since the Second Industrial Revolution, although the majority of the decline came around from the start to the end of the 20th century.[59][60][61][62] In raw terms for example, infant mortality in England sat around 151 deaths to 1000 live births in 1901 but by the end of the century it had plummeted down to only 6 deaths per 1000 births.[60]\n\n\nThere are two general lines of thought which are usually taken from into analysing the decline of infant mortality rates, the first line of thought comes from social historians, who ascribe the decline of infant mortality to social phenomenons of the time such as the need for a healthy population for the sake of the nation's fighting capabilities and political issues surrounding women.[59] The second line of thought comes from demographers themselves which more or less ascribe the decline of infant mortality itself more to the general decline of mortality altogether in the society than any particular reason why.[59]\n\n\nPhysical unfitness during the Boer War came into national prominence as many recruits came back to be too medically unfit for service.[62][61] With this, In 1904, the *Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Physical Deterioration* was published[63][61][62] which listed large amounts of details of the failings of the British population, and for that matter government, in sustaining a healthy population.\n\n\nThe current rate of infant mortality in the United Kingdom is roughly around 3.82 deaths per 1,000 live births.[2]\n\n\n\n### Age structure[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ageing of the United Kingdom\n\n![](image)Population pyramid from 1950 to 2022\n![](image)Population pyramid projections of the United Kingdom from 2023 up to 2100\nInterlinked with fertility and mortality, The age structure of the United Kingdom has varied with how rates of fertility and mortality have changed throughout the country's history. Due to the transition to an industrialised society, the United Kingdom has also undergone a 'demographic transition': that is to say, that it has gone from a high birth rate, high mortality rate society to a low birth rate, low mortality rate society over the space of two centuries.\n\n\nBefore the 18th century, the United Kingdom retained an age structure universal to societies in the first stage of the transition theory, with high fertility rates and high mortality rates,[5] in the late 18th century, the Industrial Revolution began, kickstarting the country's transition into the second phase: mortality rates declined but birth rates stayed at the same level;[5] by 1870, the country had begun to transition into the third phase:[5] the birth rate began to decline from around near 5 children per woman to below replacement level in the 1930s.[5] The fourth phase of the transition began in the 1960s, when the fertility rate rose, and peaked during the middle of the decade, and then collapsed by 1973 to a below replacement level rate. Since then, the rate has not risen to an above replacement level fertility rate; this has resulted in a population which is currently ageing:[5] in 2007, for the first time in the country's history, there were more people over the age of 60 than there were under the age of 16.[64]\n\n\nPeaks and bands within the population represent different periods in which people were born, for example, a large peak of people in particularly for those aged 70\u201374 born following the Second World War and a wide band for those aged 50\u201359, born during the 1960s baby boom. Those aged 80 upwards would have been born in the 1930s baby dearth when the birth rate was below replacement level. On the younger band of the population there is a noticeable gap between the ages of 14 and 20, this due to at the beginning of the 21st century a lower number of children being born (and a subsequent lower TFR), however in the years following the birth rate rose during the 2010s and a 'broadening' of the pyramid began for those in the younger years leading to more children in those age cohorts. In relation to the sex ratio of the country, in the higher ages of the population, there are more women than men reflecting the higher life expectancies of women in the population, in the lower ages there are more men than women because there are slightly more boys than girls born each year.[65][66] In relation to the older age brackets, In 2015, there were estimated to be over half a million people (556,270) aged 90 and over living in the UK, up from 194,670 people in 1985,[67] and there were estimated to be 14,570 centenarians (people aged 100 or over) and 850 people aged 105 or over.[68] The Office of National Statistics has also wrote in their mid-2016 report on population projections that the median age of the British population was 40 years of age,[69] and this will continue to rise as more people in the population age and a below-replacement level fertility level not refilling the population. This will make the number of people aged 85 and over double from 1.6\u00a0million in mid-2016 to 3.2\u00a0million in mid-2041.[70]\n\n\nThe demographic ageing of the population is not evenly spread geographically, as people in rural areas are typically of a higher age than those living in metropolitan areas such as Greater London for example.[64]\n\n\n\nAge structure of the population in

Urbanisation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Population expansion over time of major cities (excluding London)\nRapid urbanisation began with the onset of the Industrial Revolution in the mid to late 18th century, shifting jobs and more importantly people away from rural Britain's dominance at the time which was primarily agricultural, to manufacturing jobs within urban areas which started to spring up.[78] In 1750, an estimated total of around only 1 million people lived in some sort of urban area such as a town or city,[79] which was around 1/6th of the estimated total population but a century later this had risen to 8 million people in 1850,[79] equating to just over half of the nation.[78][79]\n\n\nWhile this mass urbanisation affected pre-existing cities to a large degree such as London, smaller and 'newer' towns were in particular effected by the re-distribution of the population and exploded in raw population growth.[78] Cities such as Birmingham, Bristol, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield and Newcastle for example had an explosive expansion in population numbers around the middle of the 19th century due to the industrial expansion of said cities bringing jobs and again people in for work.[80][79] London during the 19th century become noted as the 'premier city' of the world, being the most populated city from 1825 to 1900[81] and being the first city in Europe and one of the first in the world to reach the figure of one million inhabitants,[82] and then 5 million inhabitants.[81] This urbanisation in the 19th century has had two phases.[78] This mass influx of the population into the cities resulted in a centralisation of the population into the inner city areas however by the time of the late 19th century and early 20th century when technological advancements in transport kicked off allowing cities to expand their 'peripherals' from the inner areas to create large scale 'city regions' of their own.[78] London in particular during the 19th century had the majority of its population within the city living in the inner centre, however by the 20th century a massive expansion of 'Outer London' began which slowly became larger in population size by the middle of the century than Inner London.\n\n\nBy the end of the 20th century the figure of urbanisation was 80% of the country.[78] Importance in population size however of the capital declined during the latter half of the 20th century. By the end of the 20th century, London's ranking on the most populated cities of the world had fallen down to not even being in the top 20.[82]\n\n\nThe current classification of an 'urban' area, also termed as a 'built-up area' (BUA)[83] in the 2011 census, is a settlement which takes variables from both numerical population numbers and population density; in population numbers this is roughly more than or 10,000 people living in an area.[84][85] Anything below that is classified as 'rural', having several levels of distinction to define a rural town and fringe, village or hamlet which is usually taken from population density figures.[85] These areas are then defined within 'output areas' (OA's) themselves, which are geographic areas of the United Kingdom.[85][83] The population which resides within classified 'urban' areas was 84.4% of total population in 2022 and the annual rate of urbanisation change is estimated to be around 0.8% between 2020 and 2025.[2]\n\n\n\n## Vital

UCAS estimates this to be a rate 2.5 times higher than the overall UK population. The UCAS report in collaboration with Stonewall also found LGBT students were more likely to come from disadvantaged backgrounds (compared to those who identified as heterosexual or didn't specify), have a disability (compared to non-LGBT students) and have a mental health condition (compared to non-LGBT students).[100]\n\n\nFor the first time, the 2021 United Kingdom census included a question on sexual orientation.[101] Results for Scotland are expected to be published from spring 2024 onwards.[102]\n\n\n\n\n\nResults of the 2021 United Kingdom census\n| Sexual orientation (aged 16 and over)\n |\n| --- |\n| England and Wales[103] | Northern Ireland[104] |\n| Straight or Heterosexual\n | 89.4%\n | 90.0%\n |\n| Gay or Lesbian\n | 1.5%\n | 1.2%\n |\n| Bisexual\n | 1.3%\n | 0.8%\n |\n| All other sexual orientations\n | 0.3%\n | 0.2%\n |\n| Not answered\n | 7.5%\n | 7.9%\n |\n\n\n### Gender identity[edit]\n\n\nIn the 2021 United Kingdom census, in England and Wales, 262,000 people (0.5%) answered that their gender identity was different from their sex registered at birth, including 0.10% who identified as a trans man, 0.10% as a trans woman, and 0.06% as non-binary.[105] 1% of people aged 16 to 24 years said that their gender identity was different from their sex registered at birth.[106]\n\n\n\n### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Abortion in the United Kingdom\n\n![](image)Percentage of conceptions leading to an abortion overtime from 1969 to 2020\nAbortion in the United Kingdom (however not Northern Ireland) was officially legalised in 1967 under the Abortion Act of that year, allowing women for the first time to get an abortion under numerous medical grounds outlined within the act. Previously, this was outlawed under the Offences against the Person Act of 1861 and then the updated Infant Life (Preservation) Act of 1929 which only permitted an abortion if the death of a child was \"done in good faith for the purpose only of preserving the life of the mother\".\n\n\nIn 2020, the amount of conceptions which led to an abortion was around 25.3%[107]\n\n\n\n\n\nConceptions leading

numbers[edit]\n\n\nMigration to the UK has varied through its history. Irish migration from the Great Famine predominated during the 19th century.[122] Additionally Jewish migration from Russia also arrived famously into Bethnal Green in London.[122]\n\n\nStarting from the 1950s onwards, following on from the British Nationality Act of 1948 which de jure allowed the migration of upwards 800,000,000[123] British subjects who were now British citizens in law, modern mass migration to the United Kingdom began. During this decade West Indians from the Caribbean, those from Jamaica and so on began to arrive.[124]\n\n\nDuring the middle of the 1960s to the 70s, migration flipped in origin to the majority of those arriving being of South Asian origin from the Indian sub-continent. Immigration restrictions, in response to the ever increasing number arriving, were introduced, such as the Commonwealth Immigrants Act of 1962, Commonwealth Immigrants Act of 1968 and the Immigration Act of 1971.[125][124]\n\n\nThrough the 1970s, 80s and early 90s, net migration to the United Kingdom was often negative in terms of numbers, with more people leaving the country, than entering in total.\n\n\nSince 1994, net migration in numbers has been in the positives, with more people entering the country, rather than leaving.[25] Migration increased fourfold following the election of Tony Blair in 1997,[126][127] immigration restrictions were undone such as the primary purpose rule.[128]\n\n\nIn 2004, along with Ireland and Sweden, Britain was one of the only countries within the EU to not implement 'transitional controls' on migration flows from the newly joined A8 countries from Eastern Europe.[129][130] Around 453,000 immigrants, which has been revised upwards in recent years,[130][131] from these new counties were estimated in 2015 to have migrated to the UK.[132]\n\n\n\n### Country of birth[edit]\n\n\nCountry of birth was first asked as a census question in 1841.[133]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Country of birth\n | Population[134] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image)\u00a0India | 863,000 |\n| 2\n | ![](image)\u00a0Poland | 818,000 |\n| 3\n | ![](image)\u00a0Pakistan | 547,000 |\n| 4\n | ![](image)\u00a0Romania | 427,000 |\n| 5\n | ![](image)\u00a0Ireland | 360,000 |\n| 6\n | ![](image)\u00a0Germany | 289,000 |\n| 7\n | ![](image)\u00a0Bangladesh | 260,000 |\n| 8\n | ![](image)\u00a0South Africa | 252,000 |\n| 9\n | ![](image)\u00a0Italy | 233,000 |\n| 10\n | ![](image)\u00a0China | 217,000 |\n| 11\n | ![](image)\u00a0Nigeria | 215,000 |\n| 12\n | ![](image)\u00a0France | 185,000 |\n| 13\n | ![](image)\u00a0Lithuania | 168,000 |\n| 14\n | ![](image)\u00a0Portugal | 165,000 |\n| 15\n | ![](image)\u00a0United States | 161,000 |\n| 16\n | ![](image)\u00a0Spain | 159,000 |\n| 17\n | ![](image)\u00a0Australia | 153,000 |\n| 18\n | ![](image)\u00a0Philippines | 153,000 |\n| 19\n | ![](image)\u00a0Zimbabwe | 128,000 |\n| 20\n | ![](image)\u00a0Bulgaria | 128,000 |\n| 21\n | ![](image)\u00a0Sri Lanka | 126,000 |\n| 22\n | ![](image)\u00a0Jamaica | 123,000 |\n| 23\n | ![](image)\u00a0Kenya | 121,000 |\n| 24\n | ![](image)\u00a0Ghana | 114,000 |\n| 25\n | ![](image)\u00a0Brazil | 101,000 |\n| 26\n | ![](image)\u00a0Somalia | 99,000 |\n| 27\n | ![](image)\u00a0Hungary | 98,000 |\n| 28\n | ![](image)\u00a0Canada | 95,000 |\n| 29\n | ![](image)\u00a0Latvia | 89,000 |\n| 30\n | ![](image)\u00a0Afghanistan | 79,000 |\n| 31\n | ![](image)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nepal | 76,000 |\n| 32\n | ![](image)\u00a0Iran | 72,000 |\n| 33\n | ![](image)\u00a0Slovakia | 72,000 |\n| 34\n | ![](image)\u00a0Turkey | 71,000 |\n| 35\n | ![](image)\u00a0Netherlands | 68,000 |\n| 36\n | ![](image)\u00a0Iraq | 67,000 |\n| 37\n | ![](image)\u00a0New Zealand | 67,000 |\n| 38\n | ![](image)\u00a0Greece | 66,000 |\n| 39\n | ![](image)\u00a0Malaysia | 61,000 |\n| 40\n | ![](image)\u00a0Russia | 59,000 |\n| 41\n | ![](image)\u00a0Cyprus | 57,000 |\n| 42\n | ![](image)\u00a0Thailand | 54,000 |\n| 43\n | ![](image)\u00a0Uganda | 52,000 |\n| 44\n | ![](image)\u00a0Taiwan | 49,000 |\n| 45\n | ![](image)\u00a0Syria | 48,000 |\n| 46\n | ![](image)\u00a0Albania | 47,000 |\n| 47\n | ![](image)\u00a0Singapore | 44,000 |\n| 48\n | ![](image)\u00a0Czech Republic | 44,000 |\n| 49\n | ![](image)\u00a0Sweden | 42,000 |\n| 50\n | ![](image)\u00a0Egypt | 39,000 |\n| 51\n | ![](image)\u00a0Japan | 39,000 |\n| 52\n | ![](image)\u00a0Ukraine | 38,000 |\n| 53\n | ![](image)\u00a0Colombia | 38,000 |\n| 54\n | ![](image)\u00a0Belgium | 35,000 |\n| 55\n | ![](image)\u00a0Mauritius | 34,000 |\n| 56\n | ![](image)\u00a0Saudi Arabia | 33,000 |\n| 57\n | ![](image)\u00a0Sudan | 33,000 |\n| 58\n | ![](image)\u00a0Kosovo | 29,000 |\n| 59\n | ![](image)\u00a0Zambia | 29,000 |\n| 60\n | ![](image)\u00a0Malta | 27,000 |\n| 61\n | ![](image)\u00a0Vietnam | 27,000 |\n\n\nIn the 1980s to 1990s, around 12 to 13% of births were born to foreign born mothers.

in the 19th century with the urbanisation of the country, large amounts of people moved to the capital and the nearby industrial cities, but in recent years there has been a general trend of 'de-urbanisation' as parts of the population have moved back to the countryside. An example of recent large scale internal movement in the 21st century has been the departure of 220,000 White British Londoners to other areas of rural England and Wales over the 2000s[141] and over the 2010s around a total of 550,000 people left the city.[142] Demographically by age, the people leaving the city more than entering tend to be in their 30s and 40s while people entering in their 20s.[142]\n\n\n\n## Ethnicity[edit]\n\n\n### Ethnic demographic breakdown[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ethnic demography of the United Kingdom from 1951 to 2011\n\n\n| Ethnic Group\n | Year\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1991[143][t 1] | 2001[144][145][146] | 2011[147][148][149][150] | 2016 estimates[151] |\n| Number\n | %\n | Number\n | %\n | Number\n | %\n | Number\n | %\n |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| White: Total\n | 51,873,794\n | 94.5%\n | 54,153,898\n | 92.12%\n | 55,073,145\n | 87.2%\n | 56,668,000\n | 86.32%\n |\n| White: British | \u2013\n | \u2013\n | 52,728,717\n | 89.7%\n | 52,320,080\n | 82.8%\n | 52,501,000\n | 79.97%\n |\n| White: Irish | 837,464\n | 1.52%\n | 4,167,000\n | 6.34%\n |\n| White: Gypsy / Traveller / Irish Traveller | \u2013\n | \u2013\n | 1,710\n | \u2013\n | 62,981\n | 0.1%\n |\n| White: Other | \u2013\n | \u2013\n | 1,423,471\n | 2.42%\n | 2,690,084\n | 4.3%\n |\n| Asian / Asian British: Total\n | 1,834,117\n | 3.34%\n | 2,578,826\n | 4.39%\n | 4,373,661\n | 6.9%\n | 4,722,000\n | 7.19%\n |\n| Asian / Asian British: Indian | 840,255\n | 1.53%\n | 1,053,411\n | 1.79%\n | 1,452,156\n | 2.3%\n | \u2013\n | \u2013\n |\n| Asian / Asian British: Pakistani | 476,555\n | 0.86%\n | 747,285\n | 1.27%\n | 1,174,602\n | 1.9%\n | \u2013\n | \u2013\n |\n| Asian / Asian British: Bangladeshi | 162,835\n | 0.29%\n | 283,063\n | 0.48%\n | 451,741\n | 0.7%\n | \u2013\n | \u2013\n |\n| Asian / Asian British: Chinese | 156,938\n | 0.28%\n | 247,403\n | 0.42%\n | 433,444\n | 0.7%\n | \u2013\n | \u2013\n |\n| Asian / Asian British: Other Asian\n | 197,534\n | 0.35%\n | 247,664\n | 0.42%\n | 861,718\n | 1.4%\n | \u2013\n | \u2013\n |\n| Black / Black British: Total[t 2] | 890,727\n | 1.62%\n | 1,148,738\n | 1.95%\n | 1,905,506\n | 3%\n | 2,065,000\n | 3.15%\n |\n| Black / Black British: African | 212,362\n | 0.38%\n | 485,277\n | 0.83%\n | 1,021,973\n | 1.6%\n | \u2013\n | \u2013\n |\n| Black / Black British: Caribbean | 499,964\n | 0.91%\n | 565,876\n | 0.96%\n | 599,197\n | 0.9%\n | \u2013\n | \u2013\n |\n| Black / Black British: Other Black | 178,401\n | 0.32%\n | 97,585\n | 0.17%\n | 284,336\n | 0.5%\n | \u2013\n | \u2013\n |\n| Mixed / British Mixed | \u2013\n | \u2013\n | 677,117\n | 1.15%\n | 1,250,414\n | 2%\n | 1,062,000\n | 1.62%\n |\n| Other: Total\n | 290,206\n | 0.52%\n | 230,615\n | 0.39%\n | 580,049\n | 0.9%\n | 1,131,000\n | 1.72%\n |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Total:\n | 54,888,844\n | 100%\n | 58,789,194\n | 100%\n | 63,182,775\n | 100%\n | 65,648,000\n | 100%\n |\n\n\nNote:\n\n\n\n1. **^** For 1991, Only data from Great Britain itself has been used, due to Northern Ireland not conducting an question on ethnicity within there.

projections based on Coleman, 2010\nNumerous predictions and projections of the future ethnic demography of the United Kingdom have been made over the years.\n\n\nIn 2010, academic David Coleman produced research postulating a future demographic decline of the White British in Britain, indicating that they would become a minority in Birmingham and London during the 2020s.[162] He also estimated that around 2056 to 2066, the trend of a declining share of the white populace will result in the United Kingdom having an overall white minority.[163][164]\n\n\nIn Prospect, he outlined four projections for a majority-minority scenario within the United Kingdom;[165]\n\n\n\n* If net immigration trends (in 2010) continued its overall trend of 254,000 a year and net emigration of the White British was 74,000 a year (180,000 per year), the White British would decline to 59% of the total population by 2051, 'Other Whites' projected to be at 10% and non-Whites projected to be 31% of the population. By 2066 this would inevitably lead to the White British being a minority of the population.\n* If migration to the United Kingdom was to decline to a net inflow of 80,000 per year, the White British would be 63% of the population by 2051 and would fall below 50% in 2080.\n* Using a cross-party group of MP's recommendation of 'balanced migration', where there is neither a net inflow or outflow, where immigration only consists of 74,000 a year and emigration of the White British the same, the White British would be 67% of the population by 2051 and then fall below 50% by the end of the century.\n* If there is no emigration of citizens and no immigration to the United Kingdom ('natural change' scenario), then the White British would remain at around 80% of the population by 2051 and would still remain the majority by the end of the century, albeit a reduced percentage (roughly around 75 - 70%)\n* A fifth estimate, made by the Philip Rees and the University of Leeds, estimate that if assumptions about ethnic self-identification are taken into account, and that there is a net outflow of citizens at 38,000 a year, most of which are non-white and long term net migration like mentioned turns negative, this would result in the White British remaining at around 80% of the population by 2051, 20% of which would be ethnic minorities and 15% of that 20% would be non-white.\n\n\n* Population groupings over time with projections up to 2051 by David Coleman (2010)\n* ![White population over time](image)\n\nWhite population over time\n* ![Ethnic minority population (non-whites)](image)\n\nEthnic minority population (non-whites)\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in the United Kingdom\n\n![](image)Religious affiliation in Great Britain over time\n![](image)Non-Christian population percentage growth in England and Wales\n![](image)Religious makeup of England and Wales in age groups from 2001 to 2021\nIn 2001, the question of religious adherence was asked for the first time since 1851 in the United Kingdom Census.[166]\n\n\nThe traditional religion in the United Kingdom is Christianity. In England the established church is the Church of England (Anglican). In Scotland, the Church of Scotland (a Presbyterian Church) is regarded as the 'national church' but there is not an established church.\n\n\nIn Wales there is no established church, with the Church in Wales having been disestablished in 1920. Likewise, in Ireland, the Church of Ireland was disestablished in 1871. In Northern Ireland and parts of Western Scotland there are lingering sectarian divides between Roman Catholic and Protestant communities.[167]\n\n\nThe table below shows data regarding religion for the 2001 and 2011 censuses:\n\n\n\n\n\n| Religion\n | 2001[168][169][170][171] | 2011[172][173][174][175] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Number\n | %\n | Number\n | %\n |\n| Christian | 42,079,417 | 71.58% | 37,583,962 | 59.49%\n |\n| Muslim | 1,591,126 | 2.71% | 2,786,635 | 4.41%\n |\n| Hindu | 558,810 | 0.95% | 835,394 | 1.32%\n |\n| Sikh | 336,149 | 0.57% | 432,429 | 0.68%\n |\n| Jewish | 266,740 | 0.45% | 269,568 | 0.43%\n |\n| Buddhist | 151,816 | 0.26% | 261,584 | 0.41%\n |\n| Other religion | 178,837 | 0.30% | 262,774 | 0.42%\n |\n| No religion |  |  | 16,221,509 | 25.67%\n |\n| Religion not stated |  |  | 4,528,323 | 7.17%\n |\n| *(No religion and Religion not stated)* | *13,626,299* | *23.18%* | *20,749,832* | *32.84%* |\n| **Total population** | **58,789,194** | **100.00%** | **63,182,178** | **100.00%** |\n\n* Religion in the 2011 census\n* ![Christians (59.5%)](image)\n\nChristians (59.5%)\n\n\n![](image)Population pyramid of England and Wales by religion in 2021\n* Religious groups population pyramids in England and Wales in 2021\n* ![Christian](image)\n\nChristian\n* ![No Religion](image)\n\nNo Religion\n* ![None stated/answered](image)\n\nNone stated/answered\n* ![Muslim](image)\n\nMuslim\n* ![Hindu](image)\n\nHindu\n* ![Sikh](image)\n\nSikh\n* ![Buddhist](image)\n\nBuddhist\n* ![Jewish](image)\n\nJewish\n* ![Other Religion](image)\n\nOther Religion\n\nIn the 2011 Census, rather than select one of the specified religions offered on the Census form, many people chose to write in their own religion. Some of these religions were reassigned to one of the main religions offered. In England and Wales, 241,000 people belonged to religious groups which did not fall into any of the main religions.[176] The largest of these were Pagans (56,620), Spiritualists (39,061) and Jains (20,288).[177] Despite its high-profile nature there were only 2,418 Scientologists.[178] The census also recorded 176,632 people stating their religion as Jedi Knight and 6,242 people as Heavy Metal[179] after a campaign by *Metal Hammer*.[177] These returns were classified as \"No religion\", along with Atheist, Agnostic, Humanist, and Free Thinker.[179] Those who ticked Heathen who had been categorised as no religion in 2001 were categorised as other.[179] It is unclear how the ONS treated people who ticked \"Other\" but did not write in any religion.[179]\n\n\nIn 2012 the British Social Attitudes Survey found the highest number to be non-religious (48%) followed by Christians (46%) with another six per cent identifying otherwise. Discrepancies found between surveys may be the result of differences in phrasing, question order, and data collection method.[180]\n\n\n\n### Future projections[edit]\n\n\nPew Research Center has found that by 2050 on all scenarios, the Islamic population of the United Kingdom will rise, depending on the scenario the percentage of the population which will be Islamic will either be 9.7% in a zero migration scenario, 16.7% in a medium migration scenario or 17.2% in a high migration scenario.[181]\n\n\n\n## Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of the United Kingdom\n\nThe United Kingdom's de facto official language is English which is spoken as a first language by 95% of the population. Six regional languages\u2014Scots, Ulster-Scots, Welsh, Cornish, Irish and Scottish Gaelic\u2014are protected under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. Abilities in these languages (other than Cornish) for those aged three and above were recorded in the census of 2011 as follows.[182][183][184]\n\n\n\n### Regional languages[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Ability\n | 2011\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Wales\n | Scotland\n | Northern Ireland\n |\n| Welsh\n | Scottish Gaelic\n | Scots\n | Irish\n | Ulster-Scots\n |\n| Number\n | %\n | Number\n | %\n | Number\n | %\n | Number\n | %\n | Number\n | %\n |\n| Understands but does not speak, read or write | 157,792 | 5.15% | 23,357 | 0.46% | 267,412 | 5.22% | 70,501 | 4.06% | 92,040 | 5.30%\n |\n| Speaks, reads and writes | 430,717 | 14.06% | 32,191 | 0.63% | 1,225,622 | 23.95% | 71,996 | 4.15% | 17,228 | 0.99%\n |\n| Speaks but does not read or write | 80,429 | 2.63% | 18,966 | 0.37% | 179,295 | 3.50% | 24,677 | 1.42% | 10,265 | 0.59%\n |\n| Speaks and reads but does not write | 45,524 | 1.49% | 6,218 | 0.12% | 132,709 | 2.59% | 7,414 | 0.43% | 7,801 | 0.45%\n |\n| Reads but does not speak or write | 44,327 | 1.45% | 4,646 | 0.09% | 107,025 | 2.09% | 5,659 | 0.33% | 11,911 | 0.69%\n |\n| Other combination of skills | 40,692 | 1.33% | 1,678 | 0.03% | 17,381 | 0.34% | 4,651 | 0.27% | 959 | 0.06%\n |\n| No skills | 2,263,975 | 73.90% | 5,031,167 | 98.30% | 3,188,779 | 62.30% | 1,550,813 | 89.35% | 1,595,507 | 91.92%\n |\n| **Total** | **3,063,456** | **100.00%** | **5,118,223** | **100.00%** | **5,118,223** | **100.00%** | **1,735,711** | **100.00%** | **1,735,711** | **100.00%** |\n| Can speak | 562,016 | 18.35% | 57,602 | 1.13% | 1,541,693 | 30.12% | 104,943 | 6.05% | 35,404 | 2.04%\n |\n| Has some ability | 799,481 | 26.10% | 87,056 | 1.70% | 1,929,444 | 37.70% | 184,898 | 10.65% | 140,204 | 8.08%\n |\n\n\nCornish is spoken by around 2,500 people.

See description of the file for explanatory notes.\n![](image)Literacy rates within the United Kingdom\nIn the present day each country of the United Kingdom has a separate education system, with power over education matters in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland being devolved.\n\n\nUniversal state education in England and Wales was introduced for primary level in 1870 and secondary level in 1900.[192] Education is mandatory from the ages of 5 to 18, The majority of children are educated in state-sector schools,[193] only a small proportion of which select on the grounds of academic ability. Despite a fall in actual numbers, the proportion of children in England attending private schools rose slightly from 7.1% to 7.3% between 2004 and 2007.[193]\n\n\nScotland first legislated for universal provision of education in 1696. Four per cent of children in Scotland attend private schools, a rate which has remained relatively stable since 2015.[194][195]\n\n\nIn Wales, one of the most notable distinctive features of education in Wales is the emphasis on the Welsh language \u2013 lessons in which are compulsory for all until the age of 16. Whilst a significant minority of students (15.7% in the 2014\\15 academic year) are taught primarily through the medium of Welsh.[196]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Level of qualification\n | England and Wales (aged 16 and over, not in education)\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 2001[197] | 2011[198] | 2021[199] |\n| Number\n | %\n | Number\n | %\n | Number\n | %\n |\n| No qualifications\n | 10,937,042\n | 29.1\n | 10,307,327\n | 22.7%\n | 8,827,472\n | 18.2%\n |\n| Level 1 and entry level qualifications\n | 6,230,033\n | 16.6\n | 6,047,384\n | 13.3%\n | 4,679,223\n | 9.6%\n |\n| Level 2 qualifications\n | 7,288,074\n | 19.4\n | 6,938,433\n | 15.3%\n | 6,493,490\n | 13.4%\n |\n| Apprenticeship\n | \u2013\n | \u2013\n | 1,631,777\n | 3.6%\n | 2,590,252\n | 5.3%\n |\n| Level 3 qualifications\n | 3,110,135\n | 8.3\n | 5,617,802\n | 12.3%\n | 8,225,629\n | 16.9%\n |\n| Level 4 qualifications or above\n | 7,432,962\n | 19.8\n | 12,383,477\n | 27.2%\n | 16,413,231\n | 33.8%\n |\n| Other qualifications\n | 2,609,192\n | 6.9\n | 2,570,580\n | 5.7%\n | 1,337,076\n | 2.8%\n |\n| Total\n | 37,607,438\n | 100%\n | 45,496,780\n | 100%\n | 48,566,373\n | 100%\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)United Kingdom portal\n\n\n* Demography of England\n* Demography of Scotland\n* Demography of Wales\n* Demography of Northern Ireland\n* Demography of London\n* Demography of Birmingham\n* Demography of Liverpool\n* Demography of Greater Manchester\n* City status in the United Kingdom\n* List of cities in the United Kingdom\n* List of urban areas in the United Kingdom\n* Genetic history of the British Isles\n\n## Notes and references[edit]\n\n\n### Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Note: Crude migration change (per 1000) is a trend analysis, an extrapolation based average population change (current year minus previous) minus natural change of the current year (see table vital statistics). As average population is an estimate of the population in the middle of the year and not end of the year.\n2. **^** In fertility rates, 2.1 and above is a stable population and has been marked blue, 2 and below leads to an aging population and the result is that the population decreases.\n3. **^** Note: This table has been suggested by the author of the study that it can be correlated with the table on TFR's on different ethnic groups, see below section for said table\n4. **^** Note: discontinuity in estimates from 1993 to 1996. This increase in total fertility arises from a re-basing of the population estimates for ethnic minorities from the results of the 1991 census. These fertility estimates were not published in 1998\u20132000 and the only years for which estimates are now published are 1991 and 2001.\n5. **^** Ethnic minority population has been defined historically in different terms but refers to individuals who are 'non-white'. Starred years are estimates of the total population of ethnic minorities in the country while non-starred are census year figures.\n6. **^** Percentage for Great Britain, not the entirety of the United Kingdom\n7. **^** Percentage for Great Britain, not the entirety of the United Kingdom\n8. **^** Report states that births in which no ethnicity was stated were usually White British. If assumptions about all non-stated births are actually White British, the percentage of the group rises to 75.2% of births in 2005 and 80.3% White overall.\n\n### References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"UK Population Estimates (June 2021) \u2013 Office of National Statistics\". *Ond.gov.uk*.\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** \"World Factbook EUROPE\u00a0: United Kingdom\", *The World Factbook*, 12 July 2018\n3. **^** \"Main comparisons: Population and Migration\".

According to the most recent data, Germany's population is 84,432,670 (31 March 2023)[1] making it the most populous country in the European Union and the nineteenth-most populous country in the world. The total fertility rate was rated at 1.58 in 2021,[6] significantly below the replacement rate of 2.1. For a long time Germany had one of the world's lowest fertility rates of around 1.3 to 1.4, however there has been a small increase in recent years.[7] Due to the low birth rate Germany has recorded more deaths than births every year since 1972,[8] which means 2021 was the 50th consecutive year the German population would have decreased without immigration. However, due to immigration the population has actually increased during the last half-century. In 2019 the number of people with a foreign background was 26%;[9] this category includes foreigners, naturalized citizens, ethnic German repatriates from Eastern Europe and the children of all of the above.\n\n\nUntil the early 20th century Germany was also a large emigrant nation; in the 19th century more than 5 million citizens of the German Empire emigrated to the US alone, and in the early 20th century Germany lost another two million to the US as well as significant numbers to Latin America, Canada and Eastern Europe. However, after World War II immigration began to outweigh emigration, as around 14 million ethnic Germans were expelled from the former eastern provinces of the Reich and other areas in Eastern Europe. Of these, roughly 12 million made their way to present-day Germany and several hundred thousand settled in Austria and other countries, while several hundred thousand died. Some additional 4.5 million ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe repatriated after 1950, especially around the end of the Eastern Bloc and mostly from the former Soviet Union, Poland and Romania.[10][11]\n\n\nLarge-scale immigration to West Germany began during the time of the Wirtschaftswunder from the 1950s to early 1970s when Germany had a shortage of workers and let in Southern Europeans from countries like Turkey, Italy and Spain on a temporary basis as guest workers. The liberalisation of guest worker legislation allowed many to stay and build a life in West Germany. Germany saw another large wave of immigration towards the end of the 20th century, driven by German reunification, refugee inflows from the Yugoslav Wars and large numbers of Turkish nationals seeking asylum. The next large immigration wave began after eastern expansion of the European Union in 2011 as Eastern Europeans were now allowed to live and work in Germany without a visa. During the European migrant crisis of the mid 2010s Germany took in a large number of refugees, both in absolute terms and relative to other EU member states; the country recorded 476,649 asylum seekers in 2015, 745,545 in 2016 and declining numbers thereafter.[12]\n\n\nGermany has one of the world's highest levels of education, technological development, and economic productivity. Since the end of World War II, the number of students entering university has more than tripled, and the trade and technical schools are among the world's best. With a per capita income of about \u20ac40,883 in 2018,[13] Germany is a broadly middle-class society. However, there has been a strong increase in the number of children living in poverty. In 1965, one in 75 children was on the welfare rolls; but by 2007 this had increased to one child in six. These children live in relative poverty, but not necessarily in absolute poverty.[14] Millions of Germans travel overseas each year. The social welfare system provides for universal health care, unemployment compensation, child benefits and other social programmes. Germany's aging population and struggling economy strained the welfare system in the 1990s, so the government adopted a wide-ranging programme of \u2013 still controversial \u2013 belt-tightening reforms, Agenda 2010, including the labour-market reforms known as Hartz concept.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### 1945\u20131990[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Population evolution of Germany, since 1950\nAfter the World War II border shifts and expulsions, the Germans from Central and Eastern Europe and the former eastern territories moved westward to post-war Germany. During the partition of Germany, many Germans from East Germany fled to West Germany for political and economic reasons. Since Germany's reunification, there are ongoing migrations from the eastern *New L\u00e4nder* to the western *Old L\u00e4nder* for economic reasons.\n\n\nThe Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic followed different paths when it came to demographics. The politics of the German Democratic Republic was pronatalistic[15] while that of the Federal Republic was compensatory.\n\n\nFertility in the GDR was higher than that in the FRG. Demographic politics was only one of the reasons. Women in the GDR had fewer \"biographic options\", young motherhood was expected of them. State funded costfree childcare was available to all mothers.[16]\n\n\n\nMother's mean age at first birth in East and West Germany\n\nNote: Berlin is included into East Germany for the year 2002 and 2008.

This has been attributed to a \"demographic shock\": people not only had fewer children, they were also less likely to marry or divorce after the end of the GDR; the biographic options of the citizens of the former GDR had increased. Young motherhood seemed to be less attractive and the age of the first birth rose sharply.[16]\n\n\nIn the following years, the TFR in the East started to rise again, surpassing 1.0 in 1997 and 1.3 in 2004, and reaching the West's TFR (1.37) in 2007. In 2010, the East's fertility rate (1.459) clearly exceeded that of the West (1.385), while Germany's overall TFR had risen to 1.393, the highest value since 1990,[20][21] which was still far below the natural replacement rate of 2.1 and the birth rates seen under communism. In 2016, the TFR was 1.64 in the East and 1.60 in the West.[22]\n\n\nBetween 1989 and 2009, about 2,000 schools closed because there were fewer children.[18]\n\n\nIn some regions the number of women between the ages of 20 and 30 has dropped by more than 30%.[18] In 2004, in the age group 18\u201329 (statistically important for starting families) there were only 90 women for every 100 men in the new federal states (the East, including Berlin).\n\n\nUntil 2007 family politics in the federal republic was compensatory, which means that poor families received more family benefits (such as the *Erziehungsgeld*) than rich ones. In 2007 the so-called *Elterngeld* was introduced. According to Christoph Butterwegge the Elterngeld was meant to \"motivate highly educated women to have more children\"; the poor on the other hand were disadvantaged by the *Elterngeld*, and now received lower child benefits than the middle classes.[23] The very well-off (who earn more than 250.000 Euro per annum) and those on welfare receive no Elterngeld payments.[24]\n\n\nIn 2013 the following most recent developments were noticed:[25]\n\n\n\n* The income of families with young children has risen. Persons holding a college degree, persons older than 30 years and parents with only one child benefited the most. Single parents and young parents did not benefit.\n* Fathers are becoming more involved in parenting, and 28% of them now take some time off work (3.3 months on average) when their children are born.\n* Mothers are more likely to work and as a result less likely to be economically deprived than they used to be.\n* The birth rate of college-educated women has risen.\n\n\nIn the new federal states the fertility rate of college-educated women is now higher than that of those without college degrees. Differences in value priorities and the better availability of childcare in the eastern states are discussed as possible reasons.[26]\n\n\nIn 2019, the non-profit Austrian Institute of Economic Research and the Bertelsmann Stiftung published a study about the economic impact of demographics. The researchers assume a reduction in the per capita income of \u20ac3,700 until 2040.[27]\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Census in Germany\n\n![](image)Historical population of Germany\nThe contemporary demographics of Germany used to also be measured by a series of full censuses mandated by the state, with the most recent held in 1987. Since reunification, German authorities rely on a *micro census*.\nDemographic statistics according to the World Population Review.[28] Due to the privacy concerns of the German population after reunification, Germany did not hold a regular census until the EU-mandated 2011 German Census. The requirement was met with large disapproval. As required by the EU, Germany now continues to hold censuses every 10 years.[29]\n\n\n\n* One birth every 43 seconds\n* One death every 34 seconds\n* Net gain of one person every 4 minutes\n* One net migrant every 2 minutes\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

marriage. Out of 778,080 births in 2019, 258,835 were to unmarried parents,[47] which means that around 33% or one third of the children are born out of wedlock, while two thirds are within. This percentage of unmarried birth has long been growing and reached 33% in 2010, more than twice of what it was in 1990.[48] However in recent years it has started to stagnate or even decrease.[49]\n\n\nThe Mikrozensus done in 2008 revealed that the number of children a German woman aged 40 to 75 had, was closely linked to her educational achievement.[50]\nIn Western Germany the most educated women were the most likely to be childless. 26% of those groups stated they were childless, while 16% of those having an intermediate education, and 11% of those having compulsory education, stated the same.\nIn Eastern Germany however, 9% of the most educated women of that age group and 7% of those who had an intermediary education were childless, while 12% of those having only compulsory education were childless.\n\n\nThe reason for that east-western difference is that the GDR had an \"educated mother scheme\" and actively tried to encourage first births among the more educated. It did so by propagandizing the opinion that every educated woman should \"present at least one child to socialism\" and also by financially rewarding its more educated citizen to become parents. The government especially tried to persuade students to become parents while still in college and it was quite successful in doing so. In 1986 38% of all women, who were about to graduate from college, were mothers of at least one child and additional 14% were pregnant and 43% of all men, who were about to graduate from college, were fathers of at least one child. There was a sharp decline in the birth rate and especially in the birth rate of the educated after the fall of the Berlin wall. Nowadays,[*when?*] 5% of those about to graduate from college are parents.\n\n\nThe more educated a Western German mother aged 40 to 75 was in 2008, the less likely she was to have a big family.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Percent of Western German mothers having 1, 2 and 3 or more children by educational attainment\n |\n| --- |\n| number of children\n | compulsory education\n | intermediary education\n | highest education\n |\n| one child | 22 | 30 | 31\n |\n| two children | 39 | 48 | 48\n |\n| three or more children | 39 | 22 | 21\n |\n| [51] |\n\n\nThe same was true for a mother living in Eastern Germany in 2008.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Percent of Eastern German mothers having 1, 2 and 3 and more children by educational attainment\n |\n| --- |\n| number of children\n | compulsory education\n | intermediary education\n | highest education\n |\n| one child | 23 | 33 | 33\n |\n| two children | 37 | 46 | 51\n |\n| three or more children | 40 | 21 | 16\n |\n| [51] |\n\n\nIn 2011, this trend was reversed in Eastern Germany, where more highly educated women now had a somewhat higher fertility rate than the rest of the population.[52]\n\n\nPersons who said they had no religion tend to have fewer children than those who identify as Christians, and studies also found that conservative-leaning Christians had more children compared to liberal-leaning Christians.[53][54]\n\n\nA study done in 2005 in the western German state of Nordrhein-Westfalen by the HDZ revealed that childlessness was especially widespread among scientists. It showed that 78% of the women scientists and 71% of the male scientists working in that state were childless.[55]\n\n\n\n### Homelessness[edit]\n\n\nThis section is an excerpt from Homelessness in Germany.[edit]\nHomelessness in Germany is a significant social issue, one that is estimated to affect around 678,000 people.[56] This figure includes about 372,000 people that are accommodated (in refugee shelters, etc.) by public services, e.g. by the municipalities.[57] Since 2014, there has been a 150% increase in the homeless population within the country.[58] Reportedly, around 22,000 of the homeless population are children.[56][*citation needed*]\n\n\n\nIn addition, the country has yet to publish statistics on homelessness at a Federal Level[59] despite it being an ongoing and widespread matter.\n\n## Ethnic minorities and migrant background (*Migrationshintergrund*)[edit]\n\n\nGermany does not collect data on the ethnic and racial identifications of its citizens, but does collect data on the background group by birth of an individual.[60] The Federal Statistical Office defines persons with a migrant background as all persons who migrated to the present area of the Federal Republic of Germany after 1949, plus all foreign nationals born in Germany and all persons born in Germany as German nationals with at least one parent who migrated to Germany or was born in Germany as a foreign national. The figures presented here are based on this definition only.\n\n\nIn 2010, 2.3 million families with children under 18 years were living in Germany, in which at least one parent had foreign roots. They represented 29% of the total of 8.1 million families with minor children. Compared with 2005\u00a0\u2013 the year when the microcensus started to collect detailed information on the population with a migrant background\u00a0\u2013 the proportion of migrant families has risen by 2 percentage points.[61] In 2019, 40% children under 5 years old had migrant background.[62]\n\n\nMost of the families with a migrant background live in the western part of Germany. In 2010, the proportion of migrant families in all families was 32% in the former territory of the Federal Republic. This figure was more than double that in the new L\u00e4nder (incl. Berlin) where it stood at 15%.[61] Eastern Germany has a much lower proportion of immigrants than the West, as the GDR did not let in that many guest workers and Eastern Germany's economy is not doing as well as West Germany's and had a higher percentage of jobless persons until recently. However in recent years the number of people with an immigrant background in East Germany has been growing as refugees (as well as German Repatriates) are distributed with the K\u00f6nigssteiner Schl\u00fcssel, so every German state has to take the same number of them compared to its population and economy. In 2019 19.036 million people or 89,6% of people with an immigrant background live in Western Germany (excluding Berlin), being 28,7% of its population, while 1.016 million people with immigrant background 4,8% live in Eastern States, being 8,2% of population, and 1.194 million people with an immigrant background 5,6% live in Berlin, being 33,1% of its population.[62]\n\n\nIn 2019, 26% of Germans of any age group (up from 18,4% in 2008) and 39% of German children (up from 30% in 2008) had at least one parent born abroad. Average age for Germans with at least one parent born abroad was 35.6 years (up from 33.8 years in 2008), while that for Germans, who had two parents born in Germany was 47.3 years (up from 44.6 in 2008).[62][63]\n\n\nIn 2022, 41 percent of the under-15 age group had a migrant background, 36 percent of the 15 to 49-year-old age group had a migrant background and 19 percent of the age group above (50+).[64]\n\n\nThe largest groups of people with an immigrant background in Germany are people that have Turkey, Poland and Russia as their ancestral homelands.\n\n\nAs of 2022[update], the population by background was as follows:\n\n\n\n![](image)Major groups which reside in Germany by ancestry as of 2019\n**Population of Germany in 2022**\n\n\n\nGermans[65] (71.3%)\nTurkish

groups of people are referred to as \"national minorities\" (*nationale Minderheiten*) because they have lived in their respective regions for centuries: Danes, Frisians, Roma and Sinti, and Sorbs. There is a Danish minority (about 50,000, according to government sources) in the northernmost state of Schleswig-Holstein. Eastern and Northern Frisians live at Schleswig-Holstein's western coast, and in the north-western part of Lower Saxony. They are part of a wider community (Frisia) stretching from Germany to the northern Netherlands. The Sorbs, a Slavic people with about 60,000 members (according to government sources), are in the Lusatia region of Saxony and Brandenburg. They are the last remnants of the Slavs that lived in central and eastern Germany since the 7th century to have kept their traditions and not been completely integrated into the wider German nation.\n\n\nUntil World War II the Poles were recognized as one of the national minorities. In 1924 the Union of Poles in Germany had initiated cooperation between all national minorities in Germany under the umbrella organization Association of National Minorities in Germany. Some of the union members wanted the Polish communities in easternmost Germany (now Poland) to join the newly established Polish nation after World War I.[70] Even before the German invasion of Poland, leading anti-Nazi members of the Polish minority were deported to concentration camps; some were executed at the Pia\u015bnica murder site. Minority rights for Poles in Germany were revoked by Hermann G\u00f6ring's World War II decree of 27 February 1940, and their property was confiscated.\n\n\nAfter the war ended, the German government did not re-implement national minority rights for ethnic Poles. The reason for this is that the areas of Germany which formerly had a native Polish minority were annexed to Poland and the Soviet Union, while almost all of the native German populations (formerly the ethnic majority) in these areas subsequently fled or were expelled by force. With the mixed German-Polish territories now lost, the German government subsequently regarded ethnic Poles residing in what remained of Germany as immigrants, just like any other ethnic population with a recent history of arrival. In contrast, Germans living in Poland are recognized as national minority and have granted seats in Polish Parliament. It must be said, however, that an overwhelming number of Germans in Poland have centuries-old historical ties to the lands they now inhabit, whether from living in territory that once belonged to the German state, or from centuries-old communities. In contrast, most Poles in present-day Germany are recent immigrants, though there are some communities which have been present since the 19th and perhaps even the 18th centuries. Despite protests by some in the older Polish-German communities, and despite Germany being now a signatory to the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, Germany has so far refused to re-implement minority rights for ethnic Poles, based on the fact that almost all areas of historically mixed German-Polish heritage (where the minority rights formerly existed) are no longer part of Germany and because the vast majority of ethnic Poles now residing in Germany are recent immigrants.\n\n\nRoma people have been in Germany since the Middle Ages. They were persecuted by the Nazis, and thousands of Roma living in Germany were killed by the Nazi regime. Nowadays, they are spread all over Germany, mostly living in major cities. It is difficult to estimate their exact number, as the German government counts them as \"persons without migrant background\" in their statistics. There are also many assimilated Sinti and Roma. A vague figure given by the German Department of the Interior is about 70,000. In contrast to the old-established Roma population, the majority of them do not have German citizenship, and are classified as immigrants or refugees.\n\n\n\n![](image)A family of so-called \"Sp\u00e4taussiedler\" (repatriates of ethnic German origin), because the parents were born abroad they will be counted as \"persons with immigrant background\"\nAfter World War II, 14 million ethnic Germans were expelled from the eastern territories of Germany and homelands outside the former German Empire. The accommodation and integration of these *Heimatvertriebene* in the remaining part of Germany, in which many cities and millions of apartments had been destroyed, was a major effort in the post-war occupation zones and later states of Germany.\n\n\nSince the 1960s, ethnic Germans from the People's Republic of Poland and Soviet Union (especially from Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine), have come to Germany. During the time of Perestroika, and after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the number of immigrants increased heavily. Some of these immigrants are of mixed ancestry. During the 10-year period between 1987 and 2001, a total of 1,981,732 ethnic Germans from the FSU immigrated to Germany, along with more than a million of their non-German relatives. After 1997, however ethnic Slavs or those belonging to Slavic-Germanic mixed origins outnumbered those with only Germanic descent amongst the immigrants. The total number of people currently living in Germany having FSU connection is around 4 to 4.5 million (Including Germans, Slavs, Jews, and those of mixed origins), out of that more than 50% are of German descent.[71][72]\n\n\nGermany now has Europe's third-largest Jewish population. In 2004, twice as many Jews from former Soviet republics settled in Germany as in Israel, bringing the total inflow to more than 100,000 since 1991.[73] Jews have a voice in German public life through the Central Council of Jews in Germany (Zentralrat der Juden in Deutschland). Some Jews from the former Soviet Union are of mixed heritage. Today, less than 0.1% of the total population of Germany is Jewish.\n\n\n  \n\nIn 2019 there were also a growing number of at least 529,000 black Afro-Germans defined as people with an African migrant background.[62] Out of them more than 400 thousand have a citizenship of a Subsahara-African country,[74] with others being German citizens. Most of them live in Berlin and Hamburg. Numerous persons from northern African Tunisia and Morocco live in Germany. While they are considered members of a minority group, for the most part, they do not considers themselves \"Afro-Germans,\" nor are most of them perceived as such by the German people. However, Germany does not keep any statistics regarding ethnicity or race. Hence, the exact number of Germans of African descent is unknown.\n\n\nGermany's biggest East Asian minorities are the Chinese people in Germany, numbering 189,000[62]\nand Vietnamese people in Germany, numbering 188,000,[62] many of whom living in Berlin and eastern Germany.\nAlso there are about 35,000 Japanese citizens residing in Germany.[75] There are also groups of South Asian and Southeast Asian immigrants. Around 163,000 Indians and 124,000 Pakistanis live in Germany.[62] Additionally some 30,000 Filipino citizens and more than 20,000 Indonesian citizens reside in Germany.[75]\n\n\nNumerous descendants of the so-called *Gastarbeiter* live in Germany. The *Gastarbeiter* mostly came from Turkey, Italy, Greece, Spain, Morocco, Portugal, the former Yugoslavia, Tunisia and Chile.\nAlso included were Vietnam, Mongolia, North Korea, Angola, Mozambique and Cuba when the former East Germany existed until reunification in 1990.[76] The (socialist) German Democratic Republic (East Germany) however had their guest-workers stay in single-sex dormitories.[77] Female guest workers had to sign contracts saying that they were not allowed to fall pregnant during their stay. If they fell pregnant nevertheless they faced forced abortion or deportation.[78] This is one of the reasons why the vast majority of ethnic minorities today lives in western Germany and also one of the reasons why minorities such as the Vietnamese have the most unusual population pyramid, with nearly all second-generation Vietnamese Germans born after 1989.\n\n\n\n![](image)Proportion of Germans without a migrant background (2016)\n![](image)Germany is home to the second-largest number of international migrants worldwide.[79][80] In 2016, around 23% of Germany's population do not hold a German passport or are descendants of immigrants.[81]\n## Foreign nationals in Germany[edit]\n\n\n![](image)German and foreign national population pyramid of Germany in 2021\nAs the end of 2022, the most common groups of resident foreign nationals in Germany were as follows:[82]\n\n\nThis list does not include non-ethnic Germans with German nationality and foreign nationals without resident status.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Nationality\n | Population (31.12.2022)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Total | 13,383,910\n |\n| 1 | ![](image)\u00a0Turkey | 1,487,110\n |\n| 2 | ![](image)\u00a0Ukraine | 1,164,200\n |\n| 3 | ![](image)\u00a0Syria | 923,805\n |\n| 4 | ![European Union](image)![](image)\u00a0Romania | 883,670\n |\n| 5 | ![European Union](image)![](image)\u00a0Poland | 880,780\n |\n| 6 | ![European Union](image)![](image)\u00a0Italy | 644,970\n |\n| 7 | ![European Union](image)![](image)\u00a0Croatia | 436,325\n |\n| 8 | ![European Union](image)![](image)\u00a0Bulgaria | 429,665\n |\n| 9 | ![](image)\u00a0Afghanistan | 377,240\n |\n| 10 | ![European Union](image)![](image)\u00a0Greece | 361,270\n |\n| 11 | ![](image)\u00a0Russia | 290,615\n |\n| 12 | ![](image)\u00a0Iraq | 284,595\n |\n| 13 | ![](image)\u00a0Kosovo | 280,850\n |\n| 14 | ![](image)\u00a0Serbia | 251,365\n |\n| 15 | ![](image)\u00a0Bosnia and Herzegovina | 233,775\n |\n| 16 | ![European Union](image)![](image)\u00a0Hungary | 214,695\n |\n| 17 | ![](image)\u00a0India | 210,385\n |\n| 18 | ![European Union](image)![](image)\u00a0Spain | 193,460\n |\n| 19 | ![European Union](image)![](image)\u00a0Austria | 185,755\n |\n| 20 | ![European Union](image)![](image)\u00a0Netherlands | 150,295\n |\n| 21 | ![](image)\u00a0China | 149,550\n |\n| 22 | ![](image)\u00a0North Macedonia | 146,380\n |\n| 23 | ![](image)\u00a0Iran | 143,555\n |\n| 24 | ![European Union](image)![](image)\u00a0France | 140,320\n |\n| 25 | ![European Union](image)![](image)\u00a0Portugal | 139,435\n |\n| 26 | ![](image)\u00a0United States | 121,420\n |\n| 27 | ![](image)\u00a0Vietnam | 120,535\n |\n| 28 | ![](image)\u00a0Albania | 108,555\n |\n| 29 | ![](image)\u00a0Morocco | 95,095\n |\n| 30 | ![](image)\u00a0United Kingdom | 84,605\n |\n\n\n## Population density and distribution[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Population density by municipality\nWith an estimated 83.2 million inhabitants in December 2020,[83] Germany is the second-most populous country in Europe after Russia, and ranks as the 19th largest country in the world in terms of population. Its population density stands at 233 inhabitants per square kilometer.\n\n\n\n### States[edit]\n\n\nGermany comprises sixteen states that are collectively referred to as *L\u00e4nder*.[84] Due to differences in size and population the subdivision of these states varies, especially between city-states (*Stadtstaaten*) and states with larger territories (*Fl\u00e4chenl\u00e4nder*). For regional administrative purposes four states, namely Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Bavaria, Hesse and North Rhine-Westphalia, consist of a total of 19 Government Districts (*Regierungsbezirke*).

Since the 1960s, West and later reunified Germany has attracted immigrants primarily from Southern and Eastern Europe as well as Turkey, many of whom (or their children) have acquired German citizenship over time. While most of these immigrants initially arrived as guest workers, changes to guest worker legislation allowed many to stay and to build lives in Germany.\n\n\nGermany had signed special visa agreements with several countries in times of severe labour shortages or when particular skills were deficient within the country. During the 1960s and 1970s, agreements were signed with the governments of Turkey, Yugoslavia, Italy and Spain to help Germany overcome its severe labour shortage.\n\n\nAs of 2012, after Germany fully legalized visa-free immigrants from the eastern states of the EU, the largest sources of net immigration to Germany were other European countries, most importantly Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Italy, Spain, and Greece; notably, in the case of Turkey, German Turks moving to Turkey slightly outnumbered new immigrants in 2012,[87] however, in recent years there are more Turkish immigrants in Germany than emigrants again, including illegal Turkish migrants.\n\n\nIn 2015, there was a large increase in asylum applications following the 2015 refugee crisis, mainly due to the violent conflicts in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan: 476,649 asylum applications were counted that year.[88] This number went up to even 745,545 in 2016 and began to decline after it.[12]\n\n\nIn 2022, some 23.8 million people in Germany, or 28.7% of the population have migrant background.[89]\n\n\nFollowing the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, over 1.06 million refugees from Ukraine were recorded in Germany as of April 2023.[90]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Germany\n\n![](image)Cadets of the German Navy exercising in front of one of the gyms of Germany's naval officers school, the Marineschule M\u00fcrwik\nResponsibility for educational oversight in Germany lies primarily with the individual federated states. Since the 1960s, a reform movement has attempted to unify secondary education into a *Gesamtschule* (comprehensive school); several West German states later simplified their school systems to two or three tiers. A system of apprenticeship called *Duale Ausbildung* (\"dual education\") allows pupils in vocational training to learn in a company as well as in a state-run vocational school.[91]\n\n\nOptional kindergarten education is provided for all children between three and six years old, after which school attendance is compulsory for at least nine years, depending on the state. Primary education usually lasts for four years and public schools are not stratified at this stage.[91] In contrast, secondary education includes three traditional types of schools focused on different levels of academic ability: the *Gymnasium* enrols the most academically promising children and prepares students for university studies; the *Realschule* for intermediate students lasts six years; the *Hauptschule* prepares pupils for vocational education.[92]\n\n\nIn addition Germany has a comprehensive school known as the *Gesamtschule*. While some German schools such as the Gymnasium and the Realschule have rather strict entrance requirements, the Gesamtschule does not have such requirements. They offer college preparatory classes for the students who are doing well, general education classes for average students, and remedial courses for those who aren't doing that well. In most cases students attending a Gesamtschule may graduate with the Hauptschulabschluss, the Realschulabschluss or the Abitur depending on how well they did in school.\nThe percentage of students attending a Gesamtschule varies by Bundesland. In 2007 the State of Brandenburg more than 50% of all students attended a Gesamtschule,[93] while in the State of Bavaria less than 1% did.\n\n\nThe general entrance requirement for university is Abitur, a qualification normally based on continuous assessment during the last few years at school and final examinations; however there are a number of exceptions, and precise requirements vary, depending on the state, the university and the subject. Germany's universities are recognised internationally; in the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) for 2008, six of the top 100 universities in the world are in Germany, and 18 of the top 200.[94] Nearly all German universities are public institutions, tuition fees in the range of \u20ac500 were introduced in some states after 2006, but quickly abolished again until 2014.\n\n\n*Percentage of jobholders holding Hauptschulabschluss, Realschulabschluss or Abitur in Germany[95]*\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **1970** | **1982** | **1991** | **2000** |\n| **Hauptschulabschluss** | 87,7%\n | 79,3%\n | 66,5%\n | 54,9%\n |\n| **Realschulabschluss** | 10,9%\n | 17,7%\n | 27%\n | 34,1%\n |\n| **Abitur** | 1,4%\n | 3%\n | 6,5%\n | 11%\n |\n\n\n### Literacy[edit]\n\n\nOver 99% of those of age 15 and above are estimated to be able to read and write. However, a growing number of inhabitants are functionally illiterate. The young are much more likely to be functionally illiterate than the old. According to a study done by the University of Bremen in cooperation with the \"Bundesverband Alphabetisierung e.V.\", 10% of youngsters living in Germany are functionally illiterate and one quarter are able to understand only basic level texts.[96] Illiteracy rates of youngsters vary by ethnic group and parents' socioeconomic class.\n\n\n\n## Health[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Health in Germany\n\nThe life expectancy in Germany is 81.1 years (78.7 years males, 83.6 years females, 2020 est.).[97] \nAs of 2009[update], the principal cause of death was cardiovascular disease, at 42%, followed by malignant tumours, at 25%.[98]\nAs of 2008[update], about 82,000 Germans had been infected with HIV/AIDS and 26,000 had died from the disease (cumulatively, since 1982).[99]\nAccording to a 2005 survey, 27% of German adults are smokers.[99]\nA 2009 study shows Germany is near the median in terms of overweight and obese people in Europe.[100]\n\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Germany\n\n![](image)2020 map of Christian denominations in the states of Germany Roman Catholic majority\n Christian majority, Catholic plurality\n Christian majority, EKD plurality\n Christians less than 50% of population, majority of Christians belong to EKD\n\nThe national constitutions of 1919 and 1949 guarantee freedom of faith and religion; earlier, these freedoms were mentioned only in state constitutions. The modern constitution of 1949 also states that no one may be discriminated against due to their faith or religious opinions. A state church does not exist in Germany (see Freedom of religion in Germany).[101]\n\n\nAccording to a 1990s poll by *Der Spiegel*, 45% of Germans believe in God, and a quarter in Jesus Christ.[102] According to the Eurobarometer Poll 2010, 44% of German citizens responded that \"they believe there is a God\", 25% responded that \"they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force\" and 27% responded that \"they don't believe there is any sort of spirit, God or life force\". 4% gave no response.[103]\n\n\nChristianity is the largest religion in Germany, comprising an estimated 53.9% of the country's population.[104][105]\n\n\nSmaller religious groups (less than 1%) include Judaism, Buddhism and Hinduism.[106][104]\n\n\nThe two largest churches, the Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant Church in Germany (EKD), have lost significant number of adherents. In 2020 the Catholic Church accounted for 26.7%[104][105][107] and the Evangelical Church for 24.3%[104][105][108] of the population. Orthodox Church has 1.9% and other Christian churches and groups summed up to 1.1% of the population.[104][106] Since the reunification of Germany, the number of non-religious people has grown and an estimated 40.7% of the country's population are not affiliated with any church or religion.[104][105][106]\n\n\nThe other religions make up to less than 1% of the population.[106] Buddhism has around 200,000 adherents (0.2%), Judaism has around 200,000 adherents (0.2%), Hinduism 90,000 (0.1%), Sikhism 75,000 (0.1%) and Yazidis religion (45,000\u201360,000).[109] All other religious communities in Germany have fewer than 50,000 (<0.1%) adherents.\n\n\n\n| Religion in Germany (2020)[104][105] |\n| --- |\n|  |  |  |\n| No Religion |  | 40.7% |\n| Roman Catholicism |  | 26.7% |\n| Protestant Church |  | 24.3% |\n| Islam |  | 3.5% |\n| Orthodox Church |  | 1.9% |\n| Other Christians |  | 1.1% |\n| Other Religions |  | 0.9% |\n\nProtestantism is concentrated in the north and east and Roman Catholicism is concentrated in the south and west. According to the last nationwide census, Protestantism is more widespread among the population with German citizenship; there are slightly more Catholics total because of the Catholic immigrant population (including such groups as Poles and Italians).[110] The former Pope, Benedict XVI, was born in Bavaria. Non-religious people, including atheists and agnostics, might make up as many as 55% of the total population, and are especially numerous in the former East Germany and major metropolitan areas.[111]\n\n\nOf the roughly 4 million Muslims, most are Sunnis and Alevites from Turkey, but there are a small number of Shi'ites and other denominations.[112][113] 1.9% of the country's overall population declare themselves Orthodox Christians,[104] with Serbs, Greeks, Romanians, Ukrainians and Russians being the most numerous.[114] Germany has Europe's third-largest Jewish population (after France and the United Kingdom).[115] In 2004, twice as many Jews from former Soviet republics settled in Germany as in Israel, bringing the total Jewish population to more than 200,000, compared to 30,000 prior to German reunification. Large cities with significant Jewish populations include Berlin, Frankfurt and Munich.[116] Around 250,000 active Buddhists live in Germany; 50% of them are Asian immigrants.[117]\n\n\n\n### 2011 Census[edit]\n\n\n**Religion (2011 German Census)**\n\n\n\nCatholic Church (30.8%)\nEKD (30.3%)\nOther, atheist or unspecified[118] (38.9%)\n\nCensus results were as follows:\n\n\n\n* Roman Catholic Church: 24,740,380 or 30.8% of the German population;\n* Protestant Church: 24,328,100 or 30.3% of the German population;\n* Other, atheist or not specified (including Protestants outside EKD): 31,151,210 or 38.9% of the German population.[110]\n\n\n## Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Germany\n\nGerman is the only official and most widely spoken language. Standard German is understood throughout the country.\n\n\nIn 2021, the Federal Statistical Office of Germany included a new question regarding the language spoken at home in the micro-census, a large sample survey that yearly covers approximately 1% of the German population living in private households, and the results were as follows:[119]\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguages spoken at home, 2022 micro census\n| Language\n | Absolute number\n | Percentage\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Total population\n | 83,103,000\n | 100.00\n |\n| Only German\n | 65,440,000\n | 78.75\n |\n| Mostly German\n | 4,125,000\n | 4.96\n |\n| Mostly another language\n | 13,538,000\n | 16.29\n |\n| Of which\n | Albanian | 509,000\n | 0.61\n |\n|  | Arabic | 1,348,000\n | 1.62\n |\n| Bosnian | 237,000\n | 0.29\n |\n| Bulgarian | 218,000\n | 0.26\n |\n| Chinese | 145,000\n | 0.17\n |\n| Danish | 15,000\n | 0.02\n |\n| English | 861,000\n | 1.04\n |\n| French | 190,000\n | 0.23\n |\n| Greek | 286,000\n | 0.34\n |\n| Italian | 496,000\n | 0.60\n |\n| Croatian | 384,000\n | 0.46\n |\n| Kurdish | 511,000\n | 0.61\n |\n| Macedonian | 87,000\n | 0.10\n |\n| Dutch | 97,000\n | 0.12\n |\n| Pahto | 36,000\n | 0.04\n |\n| Persian | 391,000\n | 0.47\n |\n| Polish | 937,000\n | 1.13\n |\n| Portuguese | 167,000\n | 0.20\n |\n| Romanian | 670,000\n | 0.81\n |\n| Russian | 1,639,000\n | 1.97\n |\n| Serbian | 252,000\n | 0.30\n |\n| Spanish | 284,000\n | 0.34\n |\n| Turkish | 1,879,000\n | 2.26\n |\n| Hungarian | 203,000\n | 0.24\n |\n| Ukrainian | 191,000\n | 0.23\n |\n| Vietnamese | 138,000\n | 0.17\n |\n| Another European\nlanguage\n | 277,000\n | 0.33\n |\n| Another African\nlanguage\n | 243,000\n | 0.29\n |\n| Another Asian\nlanguage\n | 514,000\n | 0.62\n |\n|  | Another language\n | 333,000\n | 0.4\n |\n\n\n### Minority languages[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bilingual German-Sorbian city limit signs\nDanish, Low German, Low Rhenish, the Sorbian languages (Lower Sorbian and Upper Sorbian), and the two Frisian languages, Saterfrisian and North Frisian, are officially recognized and protected as minority languages by the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages in their respective regions. With speakers of Romany living in all parts of Germany, the federal government has promised to take action to protect the language. Until now, only Hesse has followed Berlin's announcement, and agreed on implementing concrete measures to support Romany speakers.\n\n\nGermany is a strong supporter of the Charter, as evidenced by things like the 2022 report from the Secretary General of the Council of Europe specifically naming Germany as an example of how to incorporate minority languages in State media.[120][121] Still, Germany\u2014like many other signatories of the Charter\u2014has room for improvement in its implementation of the Charter.[122]\n\n\n\n\n\nProtected Minority Languages in Germany\n| Language | States\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Danish | Schleswig-Holstein |\n| North Frisian | Schleswig-Holstein |\n| Saterland Frisian | Lower Saxony |\n| Low German | Brandenburg, Bremen, Hamburg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Lower Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Schleswig-Holstein, North Rhine-Westphalia |\n| Low Rhenish | North Rhine-Westphalia |\n| Upper Sorbian | Saxony |\n| Lower Sorbian | Brandenburg |\n| Romany | Hesse *de facto*, *de jure* in all states (see text)\n |\n\n\n### High German dialects[edit]\n\n\n![](image)City limits sign; this city is called *Emlichheim* in High German and *Emmelkamp* in Low German.\nGerman dialects \u2013 some quite distinct from the standard language \u2013 are used in everyday speech, especially in rural regions. Many dialects, for example the Upper German varieties, are to some degree cultivated as symbols of regional identity and have their own literature, theaters and some TV programming. While speaking a dialect outside its native region might be frowned upon, in their native regions some dialects can be spoken by all social classes.[*citation needed*] Nevertheless, partly due to the prevalence of Standard German in media, the use of dialects has declined over the past century, especially in the younger population.\n\n\nThe social status of different German dialects can vary greatly. The Alemannic and Bavarian dialects of the south are positively valued by their speakers and can be used in almost all social circumstances. The Saxonian and Thuringian dialects have less prestige and are subject to derision. While Bavarian and Alemannic have kept much of their distinctiveness, the Middle German dialects, which are closer to Standard German, have lost some of their distinctive lexical and grammatical features and tend to be only pronunciation variants of Standard German.\n\n\n\n### Low Saxon dialects[edit]\n\n\nLow Saxon is officially recognized as a language on its own, but despite this fact, there's little official action taken on fostering the language. Historically one third of Germany's territory and population was Low Saxon speaking. No data was ever collected on the actual number of speakers, but today the number of speakers ranges around 5 million persons. Despite this relatively high number of speakers there is very little coverage in the media (mostly on NDR TV, no regular programming) and very little education in or on the language. The language is not fixed as part of the school curriculum and Low Saxon is used as a medium of instruction in one school only in the whole Germany (as a \"model project\" in primary school sided by education in Standard German). As a consequence the younger generation refused to adopt the native language of their parents. Language prevalence dropped from more than 90% (depending on the exact region) in the 1930s to less than 5% today. This accounts for a massive intergenerational gap in language use. Older people regularly use the language and take private initiative to maintain the language, but the lack of innovative potential of the younger generation hinders language maintenance. The language too has an own literature (around 150 published books every year) and there are many theatres (mostly lay stages, but some professional ones, like for example Ohnsorg-Theater).\n\n\nUse of Low Saxon is mainly restricted to use among acquaintances, like family members, neighbours and friends. A meeting of a village council can be held almost completely in Low Saxon if all participants know each other (as long as written protocols are written in Standard German), but a single foreigner can make the whole switching to Standard German.\n\n\nThe Low Saxon dialects are different in their status too. There's a north\u2013south gradient in language maintenance. The Southern dialects of Westfalian, Eastfalian and Brandenburgish have had much stronger speaker losses, than the northern coastal dialects of Northern Low Saxon. While Eastfalian has lost speakers to Standard German, Westfalian has lost speakers to Standard German and Standard German based regiolect of the Rhine-Ruhr area. Brandenburgish speakers mostly switched to the Standard German-based regiolect of Berlin. Brandenburgish is almost completely replaced by the Berlin regiolect. Northern Low Saxon speakers switched mostly to pure Standard German.\n\n\n\n### Foreign languages[edit]\n\n\nEnglish is the most common foreign language and almost universally taught by the secondary level; it is also taught at elementary level in some states. Other commonly-taught languages are French, Italian, Spanish and Russian. Dutch is taught in states bordering the Netherlands, and Polish in the eastern states bordering Poland.[123]Latin and Ancient Greek are part of the classical education syllabus offered in many secondary schools.\n\n\nAccording to a 2004 survey, two-thirds of Germany's citizens have at least basic knowledge of English.[*citation needed*] About 20% consider themselves to be competent speakers of French, followed by speakers of Russian (7%), Italian (6.1%), and Spanish (5.6%). The relatively high number of Russian speakers is a result of immigration from the former Soviet Union to Germany for almost 10 consecutive years, plus its having been learned in school by many older former East Germans as compulsory first foreign language.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Germany portal\n* ![flag](image)European Union portal\n\n\n* Germans\n* Census in Germany\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** In fertility rates, 2.1 and above is a stable population and have been marked blue, 2 and below leads to an aging population and a reducing population.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Bev\u00f6lkerungsstand\".

In the first decade of the third millennium, population growth in France was the highest in Europe, matched only by that of the Republic of Ireland, which has also historically undergone stagnant growth and even decline relative to the rest of Europe until recently. However, it is lower than that of the United States, largely because of the latter's higher net migration rate.\n\n\n\n### Historical summary[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Period[32] | Life expectancy inYears\n | Period[32] | Life expectancy inYears\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1950\u20131955\n | 67.2\n | 1985\u20131990\n | 76.1\n |\n| 1955\u20131960\n | 69.3\n | 1990\u20131995\n | 77.3\n |\n| 1960\u20131965\n | 70.7\n | 1995\u20132000\n | 78.4\n |\n| 1965\u20131970\n | 71.4\n | 2000\u20132005\n | 79.6\n |\n| 1970\u20131975\n | 72.4\n | 2005\u20132010\n | 80.9\n |\n| 1975\u20131980\n | 73.6\n | 2010\u20132015\n | 81.9\n |\n| 1980\u20131985\n | 74.7\n | 2015-2020\n | 82.4\n |\n\n\n### Age structure[edit]\n\n\nAge structures of the France m\u00e9tropolitaine from the year 1740 to 2021.

During the Middle Ages, more than one-quarter of Europe's total population was French;[8] by the seventeenth century, this had decreased slightly to one-fifth. By the beginning of the nineteen century, other European countries, such as Germany and Russia, had caught up with France and overtaken it in number of people. However, the country's population sharply increased with the baby boom following World War II. According to INSEE, since 2004, 200,000 immigrants entered the country annually. One out of two was born in Europe and one in three in Africa. Between 2009 and 2012, the number of Europeans entering France increased sharply (plus 12% per year on average), but would steadily decline by 2022, as more Africans began entering France.[9][10][11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSince the 19th century, France has continued being a country of immigration. During the *Trente Glorieuses* (1946\u20131975), the country's reconstruction and steady economic growth led to the labor-immigration of the 1960s, when many employers found manpower in villages located in Southern Europe and North Africa. In 2008, the French national institute of statistics INSEE estimated that 11.8 million foreign-born immigrants and their direct descendants (second generation) lived in France representing 19% of the country's population. About 5.5 million are of European origin and 4 million of Maghrebi origin.[88][89]\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

This poll measured the extent of support for restricting immigration among French nationals, by age cohort. 24% of individuals 18 to 29 were restricting immigration, with 33% of individuals 30 to 49 and 53% for both 50 to 64 and 65 and over.[123] Nearly nine years later, a January 2013 poll conducted in France by Ipsos found that 70% of respondents said that there were \"too many immigrants in France\".[124]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Country\n | 1999\n | 2005\n | % 1999/2005\n | % French population (60.7 million in 2005)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Algeria** | **1,577** | **1,865** | **+18.3%** | **3.1%** |\n| Immigrants | 574 | 679 |  |  |\n| Born in France | 1,003 | 1,186 |  |  |\n| **Morocco** | **1,005** | **1,201** | **+19.5%** | **2.0%** |\n| Immigrants | 523 | 625 |  |  |\n| Born in France | 482 | 576 |  |  |\n| **Tunisia** | **417** | **458** | **+9.8%** | **0.8%** |\n| Immigrants | 202 | 222 |  |  |\n| Born in France | 215 | 236 |  |  |\n| **Total Maghreb** | **2,999** | **3,524** | **+17.5%** | **5.8%** |\n| Immigrants | 1 299 | 1 526 |  | 2.5%\n |\n| Born in France | 1 700 | 1 998 |  | 3.3%\n |\n\n\nIn 2005, the percentage of young people under 18 of Maghrebi origin (at least one immigrant parent) was about 7% in Metropolitan France, 12% in Greater Paris and above 20% in French d\u00e9partement of Seine-Saint-Denis.[140][141]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n120. **^** \"Immigration and the 2007 French Presidential Elections\" (PDF). *Migrationpolicy.org*.

the number of foreigners living in metropolitan France amounted to 3.5 million people. Two out of five foreigners are from Portugal, Algeria or Morocco. Thus, EU nationals immigrating to France comprise 1.2 million people, and 1.1 million people are from the three Maghreb countries of Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. Immigrants are concentrated in \u00cele-de-France, Rhone-Alpes, Provence and C\u00f4te d'Azur regions, accounting for 60% of the total immigrant population. Furthermore, there appears to be a lower rate of immigrants arriving from the EU since 1975 as opposed to an increase in African immigrants.[121]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFrench concerns about the country's slow population growth began after its defeat in the Franco-Prussian War. For four years in the 1890s, the number of deaths exceeded the number of births. The National Alliance for the Growth of the French Population (ANAPF) was formed in 1896, and the Cognacq-Jay and other prizes were created for the parents of large families. \u00c9mile Zola's 1899 novel *F\u00e9condit\u00e9* is representative of contemporary concerns about the birthrate. France lost 10% of its active male population in World War I; the 1.3 million French deaths, along with even more births forgone by potential fathers being off at war, caused a drop of 3 million in the French population, and helped make *D\u00e9natalit\u00e9* a national obsession; by 1920 ANAPF had 40,000 members, and in July that year a new law strictly regulated abortion and contraception.[20][21]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Birth country of parents\n | Years\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1998\n | 1999\n | 2000\n | 2001\n | 2002\n | 2003\n | 2004\n | 2005\n | 2006\n | 2007\n | 2008\n | 2009\n | 2010\n | 2011\n | 2012\n | 2013\n | 2014\n |\n| Number\n | Number\n | Number\n | Number\n | Number\n | Number\n | Number\n | Number\n | Number\n | Number\n | Number\n | Number\n | Number\n | %\n | Number\n | Number\n | Number\n | Number\n | %\n |\n| **Both parents born in France** | 566 447 | 576 537 | 601 268 | 595 286 | 580 999 | 575 985 | 574 687 | 575 659 | 590 163 | 579 515 | 585 427 | 578 052 | 583 600 | 72.7% | 604 077 | 598 473 | 583 864 | 579 106 | 70.75%\n |\n| **One parent born in France, other foreign-born** | 101 511 | 98 687 | 101 498 | 102 013 | 103 930 | 106 677 | 110 258 | 114 090 | 119 159 | 119 587 | 121 845 | 125 058 | 129 025 | 16.1% | 119 114 | 119 957 | 119 643 | 123 855 | 15.13%\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe birth rate in France diminished much earlier than in the rest of Europe in part because inheritance laws dictated distribution of estates whereas in the UK wealth could be passed to the eldest son or child.[*original research?*] The country's large population gave Napoleon a seemingly limitless supply of men for the Grande Arm\u00e9e, but the birth rate began to fall in the late 18th century;[20] thus population growth was quite slow in the 19th century, and the nadir was reached in the first half of the 20th century when France, surrounded by the rapidly growing populations of Germany and the United Kingdom, had virtually zero growth. The slow growth of France's population in the 19th century was reflected in the country's very low emigration rate.\n\n\nThe French population only grew by 8.6% between 1871 and 1911, while Germany's grew by 60% and Britain's by 54%.[21]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe total fertility rate is the number of children born per woman.

The immigration rate was particularly high during the 1920s and 1930s. France was the European country which suffered the most from World War I, with respect to the size of its population, losing 1.3 million young men out of a total population of 40 million. France was also at the time the European country with the lowest fertility rate, which meant that the country had a very hard time recovering from the heavy losses of the war. France had to open its doors to immigration, which was the only way to prevent population decline between the two world wars.[92]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 18 January 2008, the government published a list of 150 job titles that were encountering difficult supply of labour.[148] Most immigrants living in France today are reported to cover the following sectors: agriculture, service to persons in need (childcare, the elderly), construction, education, health and services to businesses.[149] Thus, the government is seeking to match immigrants with the economic makeup of France. The current administration could also seek to integrate migrants and their families through education and training, making them more competitive in the job market. To tackle critical labour shortages, France also decided to participate in the EU Blue Card.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAn influx of Maghrebi Jews immigrated to France in the 1950s and after the Algerian War due to the decline of the French empire. Subsequent waves of immigration followed the Six-Day War, when some Moroccan and Tunisian Jews settled in France. Hence, by 1968, Maghrebi Jews were about 500,000 and the majority in France. As the majority of these new immigrants were already culturally French, because of their cooperation with colonists, they needed little time to adjust to French society.[*citation needed*] Black people come from both the French overseas territories (French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, R\u00e9union, and former colony Haiti) and Sub-Saharan Africa (especially Cote d'Ivoire, Mali, and Senegal). France has the largest black population in Europe.\n\n\nThere is a substantial Romani population in France. There is approximately 400,000 Roma living in France.\n[87]\n\n\n\n## Immigration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Immigration to France\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Europe | * Albanian\n* Britons\n* Bulgarians\n* Czech\n* Germans\n* Greeks\n* Italians\n* Macedonians\n* Poles\n* Portuguese\n* Romanians\n* Russians\n* Chechens\n* Serbs\n* Spaniards\n* Swiss\n |\n| North America | * Americans\n\t+ African Americans\n* Canadians\n* Haitians\n* Mexicans\n |\n| South America | * Argentines\n* Brazilians\n* Chileans\n* Peruvians\n* Uruguayans\n |\n| * Demographics of France\n* French people living outside France\n* Immigration to France\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Country\n | Population\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Algeria | 887,100\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Morocco | 834,600\n |\n| ![European Union](image)![](image)\u00a0Portugal | 598,500\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Tunisia | 316,100\n |\n| ![European Union](image)![](image)\u00a0Italy | 287,800\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Turkey | 250,500\n |\n| ![European Union](image)![](image)\u00a0Spain | 243,200\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0United Kingdom | 144,900\n |\n| ![European Union](image)![](image)\u00a0Romania | 137,900\n |\n| ![European Union](image)![](image)\u00a0Belgium | 126,500\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Senegal | 122,200\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Ivory Coast | 119,300\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0China | 108,500\n |\n| ![European Union](image)![](image)\u00a0Germany | 106,600\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0DR Congo | 98,800\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Cameroon | 98,700\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Haiti | 98,200\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Mali | 96,400\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Serbia | 88,100\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Madagascar | 85,000\n |\n| ![European Union](image)![](image)\u00a0Poland | 83,200\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Vietnam | 78,200\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Congo | 76,000\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Russia | 73,500\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Father born in EU28, mother born in France | 13 194 | 12 858 | 13 060 | 12 447 | 11 732 | 11 442 | 10 811 | 10 667 | 10 455 | 10 188 | 9 975 | 9 526 | 9 549 | 1.2% | 9 961 | 9 637 | 9 414 | 9 235 | 1.13%\n |\n| Father not born in EU28, mother born in France | 44 891 | 43 807 | 45 612 | 46 459 | 47 695 | 49 790 | 52 244 | 54 176 | 56 886 | 56 626 | 57 955 | 60 362 | 62 478 | 7.8% | 55 209 | 55 488 | 55 397 | 56 370 | 6.89%\n |\n| Father born in France, mother born in EU28 | 13 020 | 12 647 | 12 411 | 11 881 | 11 439 | 11 119 | 10 930 | 10 827 | 10 794 | 10 575 | 10 562 | 10 585 | 10 418 | 1.3% | 10 104 | 9 761 | 9 772 | 10 058 | 1.23%\n |\n| Father born in France, mother not born in EU28 | 30 406 | 29 375 | 30 415 | 31 226 | 33 064 | 34 326 | 36 273 | 38 420 | 41 024 | 42 198 | 43 353 | 44 585 | 46 580 | 5.8% | 43 840 | 45 071 | 45 060 | 48 192 | 5.89%\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n102. **^** \"IFRI - E-note - Notes de l'Ifri - France: the State strives to shape \"chosen\" immigration - Institut fran\u00e7ais des relations internationales\". 26 July 2011.

Again, as in the 1920s and 1930s, France stands in contrast with the rest of Europe. Back in the 1920s and 1930s, when other European countries had a high fertility rate, France had a low fertility rate and opened its doors to immigration to avoid a population decline. Today, it is the rest of Europe that has very low fertility rates, and countries like Germany or Spain avoid population decline only through immigration. In France, however, the fertility rate is still fairly high for European standards. It is, in fact, the highest in Europe after Ireland (the EU) and Albania (perhaps higher than Ireland's) and so most population growth is due to natural increase, unlike in the other European countries.[125]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe screening suggests that in 2000, 19 percent of all newborn babies in Metropolitan France had at least one parent originating from one of the risk regions.[77] The figure for 2007 was 28.45 percent, for 2010 31.5 percent, for 2012 34.44 percent, for 2013 35.7 percent,[78][79] and for 2015 38.9 percent.[78] These percentages vary widely among French regions; for example, in 2015, screening suggested that only 8.1% of children born in Brittany had a parent originating from a sickle-cell risk region, while 73.4% of children born in \u00cele-de-France (which includes Paris) did.[80] The percentage for \u00cele-de-France was a significant increase from 54.2% in 2007. However, a 2014 story in *Le Monde* suggested that the testing figures for \u00cele-de-France were perhaps distorted by the practices of some hospitals in the region, which choose to test all babies whether or not they have parents with ancestry from an endemic sickle-cell region.[81]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n80. **^** \"Tableau VI.1\u00a0: D\u00e9pistage de la Dr\u00e9panocytose en 2015\" (PDF). *Bilan AFDPHE 2015*.

One reason for this could be France's relatively high unemployment, which the country has struggled to reduce for the past two decades. There is also a parallel dynamic between immigration and unemployment. Immigrants tend to be subjected to higher rates of unemployment. In 2008, the immigrant unemployment rate in France was a startling 13%, twice as high as for the national population (6%).[126] One can further analyse the trend in relation to education. In the ministry's 2010 report on professional inclusion for immigrants, 19.6% of immigrants without any education were unemployed while 16.1% of immigrants who had graduated high school were unemployed. Only 11.4% of immigrants with an undergraduate degree or higher were unemployed.[127]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

The Vichy government approved of the laws and implemented them as part of its *Travail, famille, patrie* national motto, as did the postwar Provisional Government of the French Republic.[21][20][22] Also, France encouraged immigration, chiefly from other European countries such as Italy, Poland, and Spain. (In fact, with its low birth rate, stagnating or declining native-born population, and role as a destination for migrants from other parts of Europe, France's situation before World War II was not unlike that of Germany today.)\n\n\n\n### After World War II[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the late 1970s, the end of high economic growth in France caused immigration policies to be considerably tightened, starting with laws by Charles Pasqua passed in 1986 and 1993. New immigrants were allowed only through the family reunion schemes (wives and children moving to France to live with husbands or fathers already living in France), or as asylum seekers. Illegal immigration thus developed as immigration policy became more rigid. In 2006, The French Ministry of the Interior estimated clandestine immigrants in France amounted to anywhere between 200,000 and 400,000 and expected between 80,000 and 100,000 people to enter the country illegally each year.[99]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPopulation Estimates by Sex and Age Group (01.I.2021) (Excluding diplomatic personnel outside the country and including members of\nalien armed forces not living in military camps and foreign diplomatic personnel not living in embassies or consulates.): [49]\n| Age Group\n | Male\n | Female\n | Total\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Total\n | 31 679 652\n | 33 767 802\n | 65 447 454\n | 100\n |\n| 0\u20134\n | 1 760 893\n | 1 687 156\n | 3 448 049\n | 5.27\n |\n| 5\u20139\n | 1 987 773\n | 1 899 786\n | 3 887 559\n | 5.94\n |\n| 10\u201314\n | 2 094 546\n | 1 994 602\n | 4 089 148\n | 6.25\n |\n| 15\u201319\n | 2 067 605\n | 1 953 663\n | 4 021 268\n | 6.14\n |\n| 20\u201324\n | 1 920 746\n | 1 841 850\n | 3 762 596\n | 5.75\n |\n| 25\u201329\n | 1 790 516\n | 1 806 271\n | 3 596 787\n | 5.50\n |\n| 30\u201334\n | 1 924 391\n | 2 013 946\n | 3 938 337\n | 6.02\n |\n| 35\u201339\n | 1 993 274\n | 2 096 326\n | 4 089 600\n | 6.25\n |\n| 40\u201344\n | 1 982 775\n | 2 048 758\n | 4 031 533\n | 6.16\n |\n| 45\u201349\n | 2 140 131\n | 2 174 545\n | 4 314 676\n | 6.59\n |\n| 50\u201354\n | 2 117 292\n | 2 178 427\n | 4 295 719\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n105. **^** \"Mich\u00e8le Tribalat's 2004 study for the INE\". *Ined.fr*.

The other major European powers, such as the UK or Germany, still had high fertility rates, so immigration was seen as unnecessary, and it was also undesirable to the vast majority of their populations. The majority of immigrants in the 1920s came from Italy and Poland, though from the 1930s, some also came from elsewhere in southern and eastern Europe, and the first wave of colonial French subjects from Africa and Asia. This mass immigration was ended and partially reversed by the economic problems of the 1930s.[93] By the end of the Spanish Civil War, some half-million Spanish Republican refugees had crossed\nthe border into France.[94]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Senegal | 3 811 (0.48) | 4 354 (0.55) | 4 679 (0.59) | 4 966 (0.64) | 5 213 (0.67) | 5 274 (0.69) | 5 352 (0.72) | 5 570 (0.76) | 5 915 (0.82) | 6 090 (0.85) | 6 061 (0.87) | 5 969 (0.85) | 6 347 (0.92) | 3 548 (0.44) | 3 589 (0.45) | 3 901 (0.49) | 4 107 (0.53) | 4 330 (0.55) | 4 279 (0.56) | 4 348 (0.58) | 4 581 (0.63) | 4 761 (0.66) | 4 954 (0.69) | 5 039 (0.72) | 4 798 (0.68) | 5 244 (0.76)\n |\n| Guinea | 1 356 (0.17) | 1 895 (0.24) | 2 045 (0.26) | 2 214 (0.28) | 2 390 (0.31) | 2 526 (0.33) | 2 593 (0.35) | 2 990 (0.41) | 3 179 (0.44) | 4 412 (0.62) | 4 543 (0.65) | 4 950 (0.71) | 5 659 (0.82) | 1 499 (0.19) | 1 756 (0.22) | 1 858 (0.24) | 1 970 (0.25) | 2 136 (0.27) | 2 251 (0.30) | 2 279 (0.31) | 2 595 (0.36) | 2 792 (0.39) | 3 852 (0.54) | 3 936 (0.56) | 4 203 (0.60) | 4 814 (0.70)\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Ivory Coast | 2 209 (0.28) | 3 446 (0.43) | 3 658 (0.46) | 4 093 (0.52) | 4 360 (0.56) | 4 470 (0.59) | 4 601 (0.62) | 5 082 (0.70) | 5 715 (0.79) | 6 832 (0.96) | 6 915 (0.99) | 7 150 (1.02) | 8 388 (1.22) | 2 483 (0.31) | 3 257 (0.41) | 3 535 (0.45) | 3 829 (0.49) | 4 077 (0.52) | 4 144 (0.54) | 4 308 (0.58) | 4 817 (0.66) | 5 445 (0.76) | 6 403 (0.90) | 6 295 (0.90) | 6 500 (0.93) | 7 647 (1.11)\n |\n| Congo | 3 908 (0.49) | 6 367 (0.80) | 6 361 (0.80) | 6 752 (0.86) | 6 872 (0.88) | 6 823 (0.90) | 7 022 (0.94) | 7 317 (1.00) | 7 444 (1.03) | 7 299 (1.02) | 7 050 (1.01) | 6 697 (0.95) | 6 867 (1.00) | 4 000 (0.50) | 5 612 (0.71) | 5 772 (0.73) | 6 119 (0.78) | 6 372 (0.82) | 6 210 (0.82) | 6 384 (0.86) | 6 560 (0.90) | 6 603 (0.92) | 6 519 (0.91) | 6 153 (0.88) | 5 929 (0.84) | 6 003 (0.87)\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| **North Africa** | **67 073 (8.36)** | **70 630 (8.91)** | **71 120 (9.00)** | **73 032 (9.34)** | **74 228 (9.50)** | **73 261 (9.63)** | **72 808 (9.78)** | **71 886 (9.84)** | **70 654 (9.82)** | **69 845 (9.78)** | **66 174 (9.50)** | **62 218 (8.87)** | **62 811 (9.15)** | **58 124 (7.25)** | **58 947 (7.43)** | **59 694 (7.55)** | **62 286 (7.97)** | **64 088 (8.20)** | **64 022 (8.42)** | **64 081 (8.60)** | **63 763 (8.73)** | **62 963 (8.75)** | **62 900 (8.81)** | **58 767 (8.44)** | **54 920 (7.83)** | **54 906 (8.00)** |\n| Algeria | 27 817 (3.47) | 28 628 (3.61) | 29 193 (3.69) | 30 278 (3.87) | 30 909 (3.96) | 30 930 (4.07) | 31 405 (4.22) | 30 693 (4.20) | 30 583 (4.25) | 30 080 (4.21) | 28 382 (4.07) | 26 349 (3.75) | 26 981 (3.93) | 25 847 (3.22) | 25 831 (3.26) | 26 408 (3.34) | 27 905 (3.57) | 28 899 (3.70) | 29 240 (3.85) | 29 984 (4.03) | 29 256 (4.01) | 29 102 (4.04) | 28 780 (4.03) | 26 469 (3.80) | 24 257 (3.46) | 24 329 (3.54)\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBetween 1956 and 1967, about 235,000 Sephardic North African Jews from Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco also immigrated to France because of the decline of the French colonial empire and following the Six-Day War. Hence, by 1968, Sephardic North African Jews were the majority of the Jews in France. As the new immigrants were already culturally French, they needed little time to adjust to French society.[98]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n63. **^** \"Les Gaulois figurent seulement parmi d'autres dans la multitude de couches de peuplement fort divers (Ligures, Ib\u00e8res, Latins, Francs et Alamans, Nordiques, Sarrasins...) qui aboutissent \u00e0 la population du pays \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9 \", Jean-Louis Brunaux, *Nos anc\u00eatres les Gaulois*, \u00e9d.

immigrants live secluded from society with very few capabilities to live in better conditions, the integration of Muslim immigrants is happening as part of a background evolution[107] and recent studies confirmed the results of their assimilation, showing that \"North Africans seem to be characterized by a high degree of cultural integration reflected in a relatively high propensity to exogamy\" with rates ranging from 20% to 50%.[108] According to Emmanuel Todd, the relatively high exogamy among French Algerians can be explained by the colonial link between France and Algeria.[109][110] One illustration of this growing resentment and job insecurity can be drawn from related events, such as the 2005 riots, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Immigrants by origin (2008) in

aspect of immigration, giving more power to the police, allowing them to perform random identity checks and deport immigrants without legal papers. The rise in anti-immigration sentiments was reinforced by a series of terrorist bombs in Paris in 1986, linked to Muslim immigrants in France.[100]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Two centuries of population growth\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 1.1\n | 1.990\n | 3.6\n | 77.6 | 84.3\n |\n| 2009\n | 62,465,709\n | 793,420 | 538,166 | 255,254\n | 12.7 | 8.6 | 4.2\n | 0.6\n | 1.989\n | 3.7\n | 77.7 | 84.4\n |\n| 2010\n | 62,765,235\n | 802,224 | 540,469 | 261,755\n | 12.8 | 8.6 | 4.2\n | 0.7\n | 2.016\n | 3.6\n | 78.0 | 84.6\n |\n| 2011\n | 63,070,344\n | 792,996 | 534,795 | 258,201\n | 12.5 | 8.5 | 4.1\n | 0.7\n | 1.996\n | 3.5\n | 78.4 | 85.0\n |\n| 2012\n | 63,375,971\n | 790,290 | 559,227 | 231,063\n | 12.4 | 8.8 | 3.6\n | 1.5\n | 1.992\n | 3.5\n | 78.5 | 84.8\n |\n| 2013\n | 63,697,865\n | 781,621 | 558,408 | 223,213\n | 12.3 | 8.8 | 3.5\n | 1.7\n | 1.973\n | 3.6\n | 78.7 | 85.0\n |\n| 2014\n | 64,027,958\n | 781,167 | 547,003 | 234,164\n | 12.2 | 8.5 | 3.6\n | 0.7\n | 1.974\n | 3.5\n | 79.2 | 85.4\n |\n| 2015\n | 64,300,821\n | 760,421 | 581,770 | 178,651\n | 11.8 | 9.0 | 2.8\n | -0.2\n | 1.925\n | 3.7\n | 79.0 | 85.1\n |\n| 2016\n | 64,468,792\n | 744,697 | 581,073 | 163,624\n | 11.5 | 9.0 | 2.5\n | 0.1\n | 1.891\n | 3.7\n | 79.3 | 85.3\n |\n| 2017\n | 64,639,133\n | 730,242 | 593,606 | 136,636\n | 11.3 | 9.2 | 2.1\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Region\n | 2004\n | 2005\n | 2006\n | 2007\n | 2008\n | 2009\n | 2010\n | 2011\n | 2012\n | % 2012\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Europe | 80 500 | 78 660 | 80 120 | 79 290 | 80 330 | 75 040 | 88 820 | 94 580 | 105 830 | 46\u00a0% (including from Eastern Europe)\n |\n| Africa | 70 200 | 66 110 | 62 340 | 62 140 | 63 470 | 66 480 | 65 610 | 66 280 | 68 640 | 30\u00a0% (including from Maghreb)\n |\n| Asia | 30 960 | 30 120 | 30 520 | 32 070 | 30 180 | 32 960 | 29 810 | 32 430 | 32 060 | 14\u00a0% (including from China)\n |\n| America and Oceania | 19 810 | 19 990 | 20 460 | 18 770 | 21 440 | 20 450 | 26 270 | 23 360 | 23 070 | 10%\n |\n| All countries | 201 470 | 194 880 | 193 440 | 192 270 | 195 420 | 194 930 | 210 510 | 216 650 | 229 600 | 100%\n |\n\n\n### Before World War II[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Mauritania | 793 (0.10) | 999 (0.13) | 965 (0.12) | 1 053 (0.13) | 1 061 (0.14) | 1 080 (0.14) | 1 101 (0.15) | 1 092 (0.15) | 1 107 (0.15) | 1 135 (0.16) | 1 137 (0.16) | 1 096 (0.16) | 1 237 (0.18) | 524 (0.07) | 583 (0.07) | 593 (0.08) | 622 (0.08) | 663 (0.08) | 670 (0.09) | 644 (0.09) | 694 (0.10) | 716 (0.10) | 723 (0.10) | 752 (0.11) | 716 (0.10) | 806 (0.12)\n |\n| Cape Verde | 616 (0.08) | 839 (0.11) | 890 (0.11) | 956 (0.12) | 1 064 (0.14) | 1 179 (0.16) | 1 202 (0.16) | 1 191 (0.16) | 1 167 (0.16) | 1 222 (0.17) | 1 131 (0.16) | 1 096 (0.16) | 1 229 (0.18) | 594 (0.07) | 649 (0.08) | 701 (0.09) | 778 (0.10) | 865 (0.11) | 980 (0.13) | 944 (0.13) | 1 001 (0.14) | 960 (0.13) | 993 (0.14) | 938 (0.13) | 911 (0.13) | 1 026 (0.15)\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Romania | 1 866 (0.23) | 2 477 (0.31) | 2 906 (0.37) | 3 076 (0.39) | 3 438 (0.44) | 3 891 (0.51) | 4 297 (0.58) | 4 583 (0.63) | 4 670 (0.65) | 4 813 (0.67) | 4 806 (0.69) | 4 806 (0.68) | 4 612 (0.67) | 2 651 (0.33) | 2 964 (0.37) | 3 434 (0.43) | 3 592 (0.46) | 4 046 (0.52) | 4 453 (0.59) | 4 825 (0.65) | 5 112 (0.70) | 5 059 (0.70) | 5 210 (0.73) | 5 096 (0.73) | 5 127 (0.73) | 4 872 (0.71)\n |\n| Italy | 1 458 (0.18) | 1 584 (0.20) | 1 550 (0.20) | 1 521 (0.19) | 1 628 (0.21) | 1 753 (0.23) | 1 788 (0.24) | 1 752 (0.24) | 1 770 (0.25) | 1 867 (0.26) | 1 857 (0.27) | 1 992 (0.28) | 1 894 (0.28) | 1 231 (0.15) | 1 283 (0.16) | 1 278 (0.16) | 1 320 (0.17) | 1 440 (0.18) | 1 520 (0.20) | 1 652 (0.22) | 1 702 (0.23) | 1 817 (0.25) | 1 830 (0.26) | 1 993 (0.29) | 2 123 (0.30) | 2 069 (0.30)\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n136. **^** \"Archived copy\" (PDF).

At the beginning of 2008, as the government was rethinking its orientation on immigration policy with the creation of the new ministry, the idea of a quota system was introduced as a possible alternative. In early 2008, a proposal was made to Parliament to decide each year how many immigrants to accept, based on skill and origin. However, this quota policy contradicts the French Constitution. A commission was formed in February 2008 to study how the Constitution could be changed to allow for a quota system. The main difficulty is the origin principle of establishing a quota \"constituting a breach in the universalistic ideology of the French Republic\".[101]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| **Total** | **802 224 (100)** | **792 996 (100)** | **790 290 (100)** | **781 621 (100)** | **781 167 (100)** | **760 421 (100)** | **744 697 (100)** | **730 242 (100)** | **719 737 (100)** | **714 029 (100)** | **696 664 (100)** | **701 819 (100)** | **686 564 (100)** | **802 224 (100)** | **792 996 (100)** | **790 290 (100)** | **781 621 (100)** | **781 167 (100)** | **760 421 (100)** | **744 697 (100)** | **730 242 (100)** | **719 737 (100)** | **714 029 (100)** | **696 664 (100)** | **701 819 (100)** |  **686 564 (100)** |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| **Foreingers** | **161 626 (20.15)** | **160 789 (20.28)** | **162 925 (20.62)** | **168 197 (21.52)** | **172 521 (22.09)** | **172 273 (22.65)** | **173 422 (23.29)** | **174 268 (23.86)** | **175 017 (24.32)** | **177 786 (24.90)** | **171 946 (24.68)** | **167 525 (23.87)** | **172 562 (25.13)** | **146 597 (18.27)** | **148 673 (18.75)** | **151 772 (19.20)** | **157 473 (20.15)** | **163 428 (20.92)** | **163 598 (21.51)** | **165 625 (22.24)** | **166 457 (22.79)** | **167 236 (23.24)** | **170 732 (23.91)** | **164 006 (23.54)** | **159 253 (22.69)** | **162 585 (23.68)** |\n| **Foreingers detail\u00a0:** |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n66. **^** \" Les Sarrasins gard\u00e8rent longtemps sur les c\u00f4tes de la Provence, \u00e0 la Garde-Freinet, un solide point d'appui et de l\u00e0 purent faire des incursions dans une partie de la France.

The regions of emigrations also widened, with new immigrants now coming from sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. In the 1970s, a small but well-publicized wave of Chilean and Argentine political refugees from their countries' dictatorships found asylum in France.\n\n\nEthnic Vietnamese started to become a visible segment of society after the massive influx of refugees after the end of the Vietnam War in 1975. The expulsions of ethnic Chinese from Vietnam in the 1970s led to a wave of immigration and the settlement of the high-rise neighbourhood near the *Porte d'Italie*, where the Chinatown of Paris is located. Located in the 13th arrondissement, the area contains many ethnic Chinese inhabitants.[103]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Mauritius | 410 (0.05) | 463 (0.06) | 437 (0.06) | 420 (0.05) | 434 (0.06) |

birth rates to decline helped defeat proposals before World War II to permit women to vote. The birth rate declined again after a brief baby boom from 1920 to 1923, and reached an all-time low during peacetime in the late 1930s. During the \"hollow years\" of the decade, the number of new conscripts declined because of the lack of births during World War I. From 1935 deaths exceeded births; the press widely discussed the country's decreasing population. Both left and right supported pro-natalist policies; even the French Communist Party ended its opposition to anti-birth control and anti-abortion laws in 1936, and its leader, Maurice Thorez, advocated for the \"protection of family and childhood\".[20][21]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Cambodia | 675 (0.08) | 696 (0.09) | 629 (0.08) | 594 (0.08) | 632 (0.08) | 520 (0.07) | 496 (0.07) |

Sweden's population was 10,538,026 (Apr 2023), making it the 15th-most populous country in Europe after Czech Republic, the 10th-most populous member state of the European Union, and the 87th-most populous country in the world. The total fertility rate was rated at 1.66 in 2020,[1] which is far below the replacement rate of 2.1.\n\n\nThe population exceeded 10 million for the first time on Friday, 20 January 2017.[2][3] The three largest cities are Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malm\u00f6. Sweden's population has become much more ethnically, religiously and linguistically diverse over the past 70 years as a result of immigration. Every fourth (24.9%) resident in the country has a foreign background and every third (32.3%) has at least one parent born abroad. The most common foreign ancestry is Finnish.[4]\n\n\nStatistics Sweden projects a Swedish population of 12.6 million in 2070.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Swedish population pyramid, 1860\u20132020\n\nDemographic statistics according to the World Population Review.[6]\n\n\n\n* One birth every 4 minutes\n* One death every 6 minutes\n* Net gain of one person every 8 minutes\n* One net migrant every 14 minutes\n\n\n### Cities[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of cities in Sweden by population\n\nSweden has 17 cities with a population of over 100,000 people. Most of Sweden's population lives in Svealand and G\u00f6taland.\n\n\n\n### Fertility[edit]\n\n\n![](image)TFR of Sweden overtime to 2016\nThe total fertility rate is the number of children born per woman. It is based on fairly good data for the entire period.

During the 1990s, birth rate increased by more than 100,000 children per year while death rates fell and immigration surged. In the early 2000s, birth rate declined as immigration increased further, with the context of unrest in the Middle East, upholding steady population growth.[10][11]\n\n\n\n### Population projections[edit]\n\n\nIn 1950 Sweden had fewer people aged 10\u201320 with more people ages 20\u201330 and 0\u201310. In 2017 the ratio of male to female remains steady at about 50\u201350. As a whole, the graph broadens with people appearing to live longer. In 2050 it is predicted that all ages will increase from below 300,000 males and females to above 300,000 males and females. With about 50,000 people living to the ages of 90\u2013100. In 2100 the graph is shaped as a rectangle with people of all ages and genders remaining steady. It narrows slightly at the top of the graph with about 250,000/300,000 males and females living to be 90\u2013100 years old.[12]\nStatistics Sweden projects the following population development in Sweden:[13]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Projection\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 2016 | 9,995,000\n |\n| 2020 | 10,431,000\n |\n| 2026 | 11,046,000\n |\n| 2030 | 11,344,000\n |\n| 2040 | 11,898,000\n |\n| 2050 | 12,395,000\n |\n| 2060 | 12,858,000\n |\n\n\nEurostat projects a population in Sweden reaching 11,994,364 people in 2040 and 14,388,478 in 2080.[14]\n\n\n\n### Urbanisation and population density[edit]\n\n\nThe population density is just over 25 people per km2 (65 per square mile), with 1,437 persons per km2 in localities (continuous settlement with at least 200 inhabitants).[15],[16] 87% of the population live in urban areas, which cover 1.5% of the entire land area.[17] 63% of Swedes are in large urban areas.[17] The population density is substantially higher in the south than in the north. The capital city Stockholm has a municipal population of about 950,000 (with 1.5 million in the urban area and 2.3 million in the metropolitan area). The second- and third-largest cities are Gothenburg and Malm\u00f6. Greater Gothenburg counts just over a million inhabitants and the same goes for the western part of Scania, along the \u00d6resund. The \u00d6resund Region, the Danish-Swedish cross-border region around the \u00d6resund that Malm\u00f6 is part of, has a population of 4 million. Outside of major cities, areas with notably higher population density include the agricultural part of \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland, the western coast, the area around Lake M\u00e4laren and the agricultural area around Uppsala.\n\n\nNorrland, which covers approximately 60% of the Swedish territory, has a very low population density (below 5 people per square kilometer). The mountains and most of the remote coastal areas are almost unpopulated. Low population density exists also in large parts of western Svealand, as well as southern and central Sm\u00e5land. An area known as *Finnveden*, which is located in the south-west of Sm\u00e5land, and mainly below the 57th parallel, can also be considered as almost empty of people.\n\n\n\n## Origin[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Percentage born to foreign born mothers\nThe majority of the population are ethnic Swedes, or people who can trace most of their ethnicity to Sweden going back at least 12 generations. The Sweden Finns are a large ethnic minority comprising approximately 50,000 along the Swedish-Finnish border, and 450,000 first and second-generation immigrated ethnic Finns, mainly living in the M\u00e4laren Valley region. Me\u00e4nkieli Finnish has official status in parts of northern Sweden near the Finnish border. In addition, Sweden's indigenous population groups include the Sami people, who have a history of practicing hunting and gathering and gradually adopting a largely semi-nomadic reindeer herding lifestyle. While the S\u00e1mi have lived in Fennoscandia from at earliest 3,500 years[18] to at latest around 2,650 years,[19] S\u00e1mi settlement of Scandinavia does not predate Norse/Scandinavian settlement of Scandinavia, as sometimes popularly assumed. The migration of Germanic-speaking peoples to Southern Scandinavia happened independently and separate from the later Sami migrations into the northern regions.[20] Today, the Sami language holds the status of official minority language in the Norrbotten, V\u00e4sterbotten and J\u00e4mtland counties.\n\n\nIn addition to the Sami, Tornedalers, and Sweden Finns, Jewish and Roma people have national minority status in Sweden.[21]\n\n\nThere are no official statistics on ethnicity, but according to Statistics Sweden, around two million (19.6%) inhabitants in Sweden are born in another country. Of those, more than half are Swedish citizens.[22] The most common countries of origin were Syria (1.82%), Finland (1.45%), Iraq (1.41%), Poland (0.91%), Iran (0.76%) and Somalia (0.67%).[23] The average age in Sweden is 41.1 years.[24]\n\n\nThere are at least two studies that forecast future demographic changes in Sweden largely due to immigration and low birth rates. A 2006 study states that \"[based upon current data, extrapolated with relevant assumptions] Sweden and the Netherlands would have majority foreign-origin populations by the end of the [21st] century.\"[25] A 2018 study concluded that in Sweden by \"2065, the share of the native population is [set] to decrease to 49%, the Western population is projected to fall to 63%, and the Muslim population increase to 25%.\"[26] Thomas Lindh, at the time head researcher for the Swedish Institute for Futures Studies, claimed in an interview that by the year \"2050, more than half of Sweden's population will be immigrants or second-generation immigrants.\"[27]\n\n\n\n\n\nOrigin statistics in Sweden back to 1900\n| Background Groups\n | Year\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1900[28] | 1930[28] |

Swedish background in color, foreign background in gray\nPrior to World War II, emigrants generally outnumbered immigrants. Since then, net migration has been positive with many immigrants coming to Sweden from the 1970s through today.\n\n\n\n### Emigration[edit]\n\n\nBetween 1820 and 1930, approximately 1.3 million Swedes, a third of the country's population at the time, emigrated to North America, and most of them to the United States. There are more than 4.4 million Swedish Americans according to a 2006 US Census Bureau estimate.[38] In Canada, the community of Swedish ancestry is 330,000 strong.[39]\n\n\n\n### Immigration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Immigration to Sweden\n\n![](image)\n![](image)Increases (1984\u20132014) of asylum in Sweden by origin Serbia and Montenegro: 118 669\n Iraq: 98 211\n Syria: 65 616\n Bosnia-Herzegovina: 58 166\n Somalia: 55 123\n Iran: 50 571\n Other countries: 134 479\n Unknown: 43 350\n Data source (Swedish government).\nThe demographic profile of Sweden has altered considerably due to immigration patterns since the 1970s. As of 2020, Statistics Sweden reported that around 2,686,040 or 25.9% of the inhabitants of Sweden were from a foreign background: that is, each such person either had been born abroad or had been born in Sweden to two parents who themselves had both been born abroad.[40] Also taking into account people with only one parent born abroad, this number increases to one third (33.5%).[41]\n\n\nAdditionally, the birth rate among immigrant women after arriving in Sweden is somewhat higher than among ethnic Swedes.[42] Taking into account the fact that immigrant women have on average fewer[*citation needed*] children than Swedish women of comparable age, however, the difference in total birth rate is only 0.1 children more if the woman is foreign born \u2013 with the disclaimer that some women may have children not immigrating to and not reported in Sweden, who are thus not included in the statistics.[43]\n\n\n\n#### Historical immigration[edit]\n\n\nWorld War II\nImmigration increased markedly with World War II. Historically, the most numerous of foreign born nationalities are ethnic Germans from Germany and other Scandinavians from Denmark and Norway.[*citation needed*] In short order, 70,000 war children were evacuated from Finland, of which 15,000 remained in Sweden. Also, many of Denmark's nearly 7,000 Jews who were evacuated to Sweden decided to remain there.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nA sizable community from the Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) arrived during the Second World War.[44]\n\n\n\n1945 to 1967\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, the recruitment of immigrant labour was an important factor of immigration. The Nordic countries signed a trade agreement in 1952, establishing a common labour market and free movement across borders. This migration within the Nordic countries, especially from Finland, was essential to create the tax-base required for the expansion of the strong public sector now characteristic of Scandinavia.[*citation needed*] but the influx gave rise to an anti-Finnish sentiment within Sweden and Norway.\nThis continued until 1967, when the labour market became saturated, and Sweden introduced new immigration controls.\n\n\nOn a smaller scale, Sweden took in political refugees from Hungary and the former Czechoslovakia after their countries were invaded by the Soviet Union in 1956 and 1968, respectively.\n\n\n\n#### Contemporary immigration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Swedish and foreign born population pyramid in 2022\nSince the early 1970s, immigration to Sweden has been mostly due to refugee migration and family reunification from countries in the Middle East and Latin America.[45]\nAccording to Eurostat, in 2010, there were 1.33 million foreign-born residents in Sweden, corresponding to 14.3% of the total population. Of these, 859,000 (64.3%) were born outside the EU and 477,000 (35.7%) were born in another EU Member State.[46][47] By comparison, the Swedish civil registry reports, for 2018, that nearly 1.96 million residents are foreign-born, a 47% increase from 2010. There are 8.27 million Swedish-born residents, giving a total population of 10.23 million, and a 19.1% foreign-born population.[48]\n\n\nThe first group of Assyrians/Syriacs moved to Sweden from Lebanon in 1967. Many of them live in S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje (Stockholm).[49][50] There are also around 40,000 Roma in Sweden.[51] Some Roma people have long historical roots in Sweden, while others are more recent migrants from elsewhere in Europe.\n\n\nImmigrants from Western Asia have been a rapidly growing share of Sweden's population. According to the government agency Statistics Sweden, the number of immigrants born in all of Asia (including the Middle East) rose from just 1,000 in 1950 to 295,000 in 2003.[52] Most of those immigrants came from Iraq, Iran, Lebanon and Syria, according to Statistics Sweden.[52]\n\n\nImmigration of Iraqis increased dramatically during the Iraq War, beginning in 2003. A total of 8,951 Iraqis came to Sweden in 2006, accounting for 45% of the entire Iraqi migration to Europe. By 2007, the community of Iraqis in Sweden numbered above 70,000. In 2008, Sweden introduced tighter rules on asylum seekers.[53]\n\n\nA significant number of Syrian Christians have also settled in Sweden. There have also been immigrants from South-Central Asia such as Afghanistan and India. Since the European migrant crisis, Syrians became the second-largest group of foreign-born persons in the Swedish civil registry in 2017 with 158,443 people (after former Yugoslavia).\n\n\nNote that the table below lists the citizenship the person had when arriving in Sweden, and therefore there are no registered Eritreans, Russians or Bosnians from 1990, they were recorded as Ethiopians, Soviets and Yugoslavs. The nationality of Yugoslavs below is therefore people who came to Sweden from the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia before 1991 and people who came from today's Montenegro and Serbia before 2003, then called the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Counting all people who came from Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, Kosovo, Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, there were 176,033 people from there in 2018.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 47 countries with over 10,000 foreign-born persons in 2022.[54]\n| Country | 1900 | 1930 | 1960 | 1990 | 2000 |

Sweden\n\nThe Swedish language is by far the dominating language in Sweden, and is used by the government administration. English is also widely spoken and is taught in public schools.\n\n\nSince 1999, Sweden has five officially recognised minority languages: Sami, Me\u00e4nkieli, Standard Finnish, Romani and Yiddish.\n\n\nThe Sami language, spoken by about 7,000 people in Sweden, may be used in government agencies, courts, preschools and nursing homes in the municipalities of Arjeplog, G\u00e4llivare, Jokkmokk and Kiruna and its immediate neighbourhood.[*clarify*]\n\n\nSimilarly, Finnish and Me\u00e4nkieli can be used in the municipalities of G\u00e4llivare, Haparanda, Kiruna, Pajala and \u00d6vertorne\u00e5 and its immediate neighbourhood.\nFinnish is also official language, along with Swedish, in the city of Eskilstuna.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nDuring the mid to late 20th century, immigrant communities brought other languages, among others being Persian, Serbo-Croatian, Arabic and Neo-Aramaic.[55]\n\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Sweden\n\nThe majority (56.4%) of the population belongs to the Church of Sweden,[56] the Lutheran church that was disestablished as a state church in 2000. Until 1996, those who had family members in the church automatically became members at birth.[57] Other Christian denominations in Sweden include the Roman Catholic Church (see Catholic Church in Sweden), several Orthodox churches in diaspora, Baptist, Pentecostal, Neo-pietistic (*nyevangeliska*) and other evangelical Christian churches (*frikyrkor* = 'free churches'). Shamanism persisted among the Sami people up until the 18th century, but no longer exists in its traditional form as most Sami today belong to the Lutheran church.\n\n\nJews were permitted to practice their religion in five Swedish cities in 1782, and have enjoyed full rights as citizens since 1870. The new Freedom of Religion Bill was passed in 1951, and former obstacles against Non-Lutherans working in schools and hospitals were removed. Further, that bill made it legal to leave any religious denomination, without entering another. There are also many Muslims, as well as a number of Buddhists and Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds in Sweden, mainly as a result of 20th and 21st century immigration. There is also a small Zoroastrian community in Sweden.[58]\n\n\n\n## Homelessness[edit]\n\n\nThis section is an excerpt from Homelessness in Sweden.[edit]\n![](image)A homeless person's bed in G\u00f6teborg, Sweden, 2013.\nHomelessness in Sweden affects some 34,000 people.[59][60]\n\n\nThe Swedish government's response to homelessness has included commissioning national surveys on homelessness during the last decade that allow for direct comparison between Sweden, Denmark and Norway.[61] The three countries have very similar definitions of homelessness, with minor variations.[62]\n\n\n\nSome researchers maintain that measures to counteract homelessness in Sweden are largely dependent on a general premise equating homelessness with addiction, mental illness and deviance.[63] On the other hand, youth homelessness is considered a child protection problem.[64]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Statistics Sweden\n* Municipalities of Sweden\n* Demographical center of Sweden\n* Immigration to Europe\n* List of countries by immigrant population\n* Aging of Europe\n* List of Swedish counties by fertility rate\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Crude migration change (per 1,000) is a trend analysis, an extrapolation based average population change (current year minus previous) minus natural change of the current year (see table vital statistics).
