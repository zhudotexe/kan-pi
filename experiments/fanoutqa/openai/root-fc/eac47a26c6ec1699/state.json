Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th century. By the 19th century, Harvard emerged as the most prominent academic and cultural institution among the Boston elite.[10][11] Following the American Civil War, under President Charles William Eliot's long tenure (1869\u20131909), the college developed multiple affiliated professional schools that transformed the college into a modern research university. In 1900, Harvard co-founded the Association of American Universities.[12] James B. Conant led the university through the Great Depression and World War II, and liberalized admissions after the war.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nAssociation of Independent Colleges and Universities in Massachusetts (AICUM)\n |\n| --- |\n| * Amherst\n* Anna Maria\n* Assumption\n* Babson\n* Bay Path\n* Benjamin F.

The university's rapid enrollment growth also was a product of both the founding of new graduate academic programs and an expansion of the undergraduate college. Radcliffe College emerged as the female counterpart of Harvard College, becoming one of the most prominent schools for women in the United States. In 1900, Harvard became a founding member of the Association of American Universities.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPresident James B. Conant led the university from 1933 to 1953; Conant reinvigorated creative scholarship in an effort to guarantee Harvard's preeminence among the nation and world's emerging research institutions. Conant viewed higher education as a vehicle of opportunity for the talented rather than an entitlement for the wealthy. As such, he devised programs to identify, recruit, and support talented youth. An influential 268-page report issued by Harvard faculty in 1945 under Conant's leadership, *General Education in a Free Society*, remains one the most important works in curriculum studies.[40]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Links to related articles\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nIvy League\n |\n| --- |\n| Teams | * Brown Bears\n* Columbia Lions\n* Cornell Big Red\n* Dartmouth Big Green\n* Harvard Crimson\n* Penn Quakers\n* Princeton Tigers\n* Yale Bulldogs\n |\n| Competitions | * Baseball\n* Basketball (men's)\n* Basketball (women's)\n* Fencing\n* Rugby\n |\n| Related topics | * Big Three\n* Business schools\n* Digital Network\n* Ivy Council\n* Law schools\n* Medical schools\n* Nude posture photos\n* Public Ivy\n* Public policy schools\n* *Take Ivy*\n* Y Tu Tambien\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nStudent life and activities are generally organized within each school.\n\n\n\n### Student government[edit]\n\n\nThe Undergraduate Council represents College students.

Levin was, at the time, one of the highest paid university presidents in the United States with a 2008 salary of $1.5\u00a0million.[87] Yale's succeeding president Peter Salovey ranks 40th with a 2020 salary of $1.16 million.[88]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nYale's residential college system was established in 1933 by Edward S. Harkness, who admired the social intimacy of Oxford and Cambridge and donated significant funds to found similar colleges at Yale and Harvard. Though Yale's colleges resemble their English precursors organizationally and architecturally, they are dependent entities of Yale College and have limited autonomy. The colleges are led by a head and an academic dean, who reside in the college, and university faculty and affiliates constitute each college's fellowship. Colleges offer their own seminars, social events, and speaking engagements known as \"Master's Teas\", but do not contain programs of study or academic departments. All other undergraduate courses are taught by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and are open to members of any college.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSusan Hockfield became the president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.[94] In 2004, Dean of the Nursing school, Catherine Gilliss, was appointed the dean of Duke University's School of Nursing and vice chancellor for nursing affairs.[95] In 2007, Deputy Provost H. Kim Bottomly was named president of Wellesley College.[96]\n\n\nSimilar examples for men who have served in Yale leadership positions can also be found. In 2004, Dean of Yale College Richard H.

The Act was an effort to create an institution to train ministers and lay leadership for Connecticut. Soon after, a group of ten Congregational ministers, Samuel Andrew, Thomas Buckingham, Israel Chauncy, Samuel Mather (nephew of Increase Mather), Rev. James Noyes II (son of James Noyes), James Pierpont, Abraham Pierson, Noadiah Russell, Joseph Webb, and Timothy Woodbridge, all alumni of Harvard, met in the study of Reverend Samuel Russell, located in Branford, Connecticut, to donate their books to form the school's library.[16] The group, led by James Pierpont, is now known as \"The Founders\".[17]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Links to related articles\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nIvy League\n |\n| --- |\n| Teams | * Brown Bears\n* Columbia Lions\n* Cornell Big Red\n* Dartmouth Big Green\n* Harvard Crimson\n* Penn Quakers\n* Princeton Tigers\n* Yale Bulldogs\n |\n| Competitions | * Baseball\n* Basketball (men's)\n* Basketball (women's)\n* Fencing\n* Rugby\n |\n| Related topics | * Big Three\n* Business schools\n* Digital Network\n* Ivy Council\n* Law schools\n* Medical schools\n* Nude posture photos\n* Public Ivy\n* Public policy schools\n* *Take Ivy*\n* Y Tu Tambien\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nColonial colleges\n |\n| --- |\n| * Brown\n* Columbia\n* Dartmouth\n* Harvard\n* Penn\n* Princeton\n* Rutgers\n* William & Mary\n* Yale\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n26. **^** Morgan, Edmund S.

During this period, Harvard was distinctive for the stability and maturity of its tutor corps, while Yale had youth and zeal on its side.[29]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **Collegiate School** was established in 1701 by Congregationalist clergy of the Connecticut Colony. At first restricted to instructing ministers in theology and sacred languages, the curriculum began to incorporate humanities and sciences by the time of the American Revolution. In the 19th century, the college expanded into graduate and professional instruction, awarding the first PhD in the United States in 1861 and organizing as a university in 1887. Yale's faculty and student populations grew rapidly after 1890 with expansion of the physical campus and of scientific research programs.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Yale Provost's Office and similar executive positions have launched several women into prominent university executive positions.

The feud caused the Mathers to champion the success of the Collegiate School in the hope that it would maintain the Puritan religious orthodoxy in a way that Harvard had not.[18] Rev. Jason Haven, the minister at the First Church and Parish in Dedham, Massachusetts, had been considered for the presidency on account of his orthodox theology and for \"Neatness dignity and purity of Style [which] surpass those of all that have been mentioned\", but was passed over due to his \"very Valetudinary and infirm State of Health\".[19]\n\n\n\n#### Naming and development[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMeanwhile, a Harvard graduate working in England convinced some 180 prominent intellectuals to donate books to Yale. The 1714 shipment of 500 books represented the best of modern English literature, science, philosophy and theology at the time.[22] It had a profound effect on intellectuals at Yale. Undergraduate Jonathan Edwards discovered John Locke's works and developed his original theology known as the \"new divinity\". In 1722 the rector and six of his friends, who had a study group to discuss the new ideas, announced that they had given up Calvinism, become Arminians, and joined the Church of England. They were ordained in England and returned to the colonies as missionaries for the Anglican faith. Thomas Clapp became president in 1745, and while he attempted to return the college to Calvinist orthodoxy, he did not close the library. Other students found Deist books in the library.[23]\n\n\n\n#### Curriculum[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Connecticut Hall, oldest building on the Yale campus, built between 1750 and 1753\n![](image)First diploma awarded by Yale College, granted to Nathaniel Chauncey in 1702\nYale College undergraduates follow a liberal arts curriculum with departmental majors and is organized into a social system of residential colleges.\n\n\nYale was swept up by the great intellectual movements of the period\u2014the Great Awakening and the Enlightenment\u2014due to the religious and scientific interests of presidents Thomas Clap and Ezra Stiles. They were both instrumental in developing the scientific curriculum at Yale while dealing with wars, student tumults, graffiti, \"irrelevance\" of curricula, desperate need for endowment and disagreements with the Connecticut legislature.[24][25][*page\u00a0needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSince the 1960s, John C. Calhoun's white supremacist beliefs and pro-slavery leadership[188][189][190][191] had prompted calls to rename the college or remove its tributes to Calhoun. The racially motivated church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina, led to renewed calls in the summer of 2015 for Calhoun College, one of 12 residential colleges, to be renamed. In July 2015 students signed a petition calling for the name change.[189] They argued in the petition that\u2014while Calhoun was respected in the 19th century as an \"extraordinary American statesman\"\u2014he was \"one of the most prolific defenders of slavery and white supremacy\" in the history of the United States.[189][190] In August 2015, Yale President Peter Salovey addressed the Freshman Class of 2019 in which he responded to the racial tensions but explained why the college would not be renamed.[191] He described Calhoun as \"a notable political theorist, a vice president to two different U.S. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nColleges and universities in Connecticut\n |\n| --- |\n| Public institutions | * Central Connecticut State University\n* Charter Oak State College\n* Eastern Connecticut State University\n* Southern Connecticut State University\n* University of Connecticut\n\t+ Dental\n\t+ Law\n\t+ Medicine\n\t+ UConn Health\n* Western Connecticut State University\n |\n| Private institutions | * Albertus Magnus\n* Connecticut College\n* Fairfield\n* Goodwin\n* Holy Apostles\n* Lyme Academy\n* Mitchell\n* Paier\n* Post\n* Quinnipiac\n\t+ Law\n\t+ Medicine\n* Rensselaer at Hartford\n* Sacred Heart\n* Saint Joseph\n* Trinity\n* Bridgeport\n* Hartford\n* New Haven\n* Wesleyan\n* Yale\n\t+ Law\n\t+ Drama\n\t+ Medicine\n |\n| Federal institutions | * United States Coast Guard Academy\n |\n| Community colleges | * Asnuntuck\n* Capital\n* Gateway\n* Housatonic\n* Manchester\n* Middlesex\n* Naugatuck Valley\n* Northwestern Connecticut\n* Norwalk\n* Quinebaug Valley\n* Three Rivers\n* Tunxis\n |\n| Graduate, professional, andresearch institutions | * Berkeley Divinity\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n96. **^** \"Yale scientist is new president of Wellesley College\".

Bush (Yale '48) derided Michael Dukakis for having \"foreign-policy views born in Harvard Yard's boutique\". When challenged on the distinction between Dukakis' Harvard connection and his own Yale background, he said that, unlike Harvard, Yale's reputation was \"so diffuse, there isn't a symbol, I don't think, in the Yale situation, any symbolism in it\" and said Yale did not share Harvard's reputation for \"liberalism and elitism\".[84] In 2004 Howard Dean stated, \"In some ways, I consider myself separate from the other three (Yale) candidates of 2004. Yale changed so much between the class of '68 and the class of '71. My class was the first class to have women in it; it was the first class to have a significant effort to recruit African Americans. It was an extraordinary time, and in that span of time is the change of an entire generation\".[83]\n\n\n\n## Administration and organization[edit]\n\n\n### Leadership[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the decentralized environment of higher education in the United States, balancing change with tradition was a common challenge because it was difficult for an institution to be completely modern or completely classical.[30][31] A group of professors at Yale and New Haven Congregationalist ministers articulated a conservative response to the changes brought about by the Victorian culture. They concentrated on developing a person possessed of religious values strong enough to sufficiently resist temptations from within, yet flexible enough to adjust to the 'isms' (professionalism, materialism, individualism, and consumerism) tempting him from without.[32][*page\u00a0needed*] William Graham Sumner, professor from 1872 to 1909, taught in the emerging disciplines of economics and sociology to overflowing classrooms of students. Sumner bested President Noah Porter, who disliked the social sciences and wanted Yale to lock into its traditions of classical education. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nAssociation of American Universities\n |\n| --- |\n| Public | * Arizona\n* Arizona State\n* California\n\t+ Berkeley\n\t+ Davis\n\t+ Irvine\n\t+ Riverside\n\t+ Los Angeles\n\t+ San Diego\n\t+ Santa Barbara\n\t+ Santa Cruz\n* Colorado\n* Florida\n* Georgia Tech\n* Illinois\n* Indiana\n* Iowa\n* Kansas\n* Maryland\n* McGill\n* Michigan\n* Michigan State\n* Minnesota\n* Missouri\n* New York\n\t+ Buffalo\n\t+ Stony Brook\n* North Carolina\n* Ohio State\n* Oregon\n* Pennsylvania State\n* Pittsburgh\n* Purdue\n* Rutgers\n* South Florida\n* Texas\n* Texas A&M\n* Toronto\n* Utah\n* Virginia\n* Washington\n* Wisconsin\n |\n| Private | * Boston U\n* Brandeis\n* Brown\n* Caltech\n* Carnegie Mellon\n* Case Western Reserve\n* Chicago\n* Columbia\n* Cornell\n* Dartmouth\n* Duke\n* Emory\n* George Washington\n* Harvard\n* Johns Hopkins\n* Miami\n* MIT\n* Northwestern\n* Notre Dame\n* NYU\n* Penn\n* Princeton\n* Rice\n* Rochester\n* Southern California\n* Stanford\n* Tufts\n* Tulane\n* Vanderbilt\n* Washington St. Louis\n* Yale\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n38. **^** Park, Roberta J.

He claimed that if they removed Calhoun's name, it would \"obscure\" his \"legacy of slavery rather than addressing it\".[195] \"Yale is part of that history\" and \"We cannot erase American history, but we can confront it, teach it and learn from it.\" One change that will be issued is the title of \"master\" for faculty members who serve as residential college leaders will be renamed to \"head of college\" due to its connotation of slavery.[196]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThese are akin to Harvard finals clubs, Princeton eating clubs, and senior societies at University of Pennsylvania.\n\n\n\n### Traditions[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Bladderball\n\nYale seniors at graduation smash clay pipes underfoot to symbolize passage from their \"bright college years\", though in recent history the pipes have been replaced with \"bubble pipes\".[208][209] (\"Bright College Years\", the university's alma mater, was penned in 1881 by Henry Durand, Class of 1881, to the tune of *Die Wacht am Rhein*.) Yale's student tour guides tell visitors that students consider it good luck to rub the toe of the statue of Theodore Dwight Woolsey on Old Campus; however, actual students rarely do so.[210] In the second half of the 20th century Bladderball, a campus-wide game played with a large inflatable ball, became a popular tradition but was banned by administration due to safety concerns. In spite of administration opposition, students revived the game in 2009, 2011, and 2014.[211][212][213]\n\n\n\n### Athletics[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs of October\u00a02020[update], 65 Nobel laureates, five Fields medalists, four Abel Prize laureates, and three Turing Award winners have been affiliated with Yale University.

Kronman criticized the title and name changes and the lack of support from Salovey for the Christakises, who were targeted by the student activists. Other members of the university community disagreed with Kronman's positions.[201]\n\n\n\n### Student organizations[edit]\n\n\nIn 2014, Yale had 385 registered student organizations, plus an additional one hundred groups in the process of registration.[202]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1966, Yale began discussions with its sister school Vassar College about merging to foster coeducation at the undergraduate level.

Both schools introduced coeducation independently in 1969.[48] Amy Solomon was the first woman to register as a Yale undergraduate;[49] she was also the first woman at Yale to join an undergraduate society, St. Anthony Hall. The undergraduate class of 1973 was the first class to have women starting from freshman year;[50] at the time, all undergraduate women were housed in Vanderbilt Hall at the south end of Old Campus.[51]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **may be too long to read and navigate comfortably**.

Through the persuasion of Jeremiah Dummer, Yale, who had made a fortune in Madras while working for the East India Company as the first president of Fort St. George (largely through secret contracts with Madras merchants that were illegal under company policy),[20] donated nine bales of goods, which were sold for more than \u00a3560, a substantial sum of money at the time. Cotton Mather suggested that the school change its name to \"Yale College\".[21] The Welsh name Yale is the Anglicized spelling of the I\u00e2l, which the family estate at Plas yn I\u00e2l, near the village of Llandegla, Wales, was called.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nYale is organized into fourteen constituent schools: the original undergraduate college, the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and twelve professional schools.[8] While the university is governed by the Yale Corporation, each school's faculty oversees its curriculum and degree programs. In addition to a central campus in downtown New Haven, the university owns athletic facilities in western New Haven, a campus in West Haven, and forests and nature preserves throughout New England. As of 2021[update], the university's endowment was valued at $42.3 billion, the third largest of any educational institution.[1] The Yale University Library, serving all constituent schools, holds more than 15\u00a0million volumes and is the third-largest academic library in the United States.[9][10] Student athletes compete in intercollegiate sports as the Yale Bulldogs in the NCAA Division I Ivy League conference.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFormer United States Ambassador to the United Nations and Former United States National Security Advisor John Bolton (JD, 1974)\n* ![Senator of Deleware Chris Coons (MAR, 1992; JD, 1992)](image)\n\nSenator of Deleware Chris Coons (MAR, 1992; JD, 1992)\n* ![Senator of New Jersey Cory Booker (JD, 1997)](image)\n\nSenator of New Jersey Cory Booker (JD, 1997)\n* ![Senator of Connecticut Richard Blumenthal (JD, 1973)](image)\n\nSenator of Connecticut Richard Blumenthal (JD, 1973)\n* ![Senator of Missouri Josh Hawley (JD, 2006)](image)\n\nSenator of Missouri Josh Hawley (JD, 2006)\n* ![Govenor of Connecticut Ned Lamont (MBA, 1980)](image)\n\nGovenor of Connecticut Ned Lamont (MBA, 1980)\n* ![Govenor of Florida and presidential candidate Ron DeSantis (BA, 2001)](image)\n\nGovenor of Florida and presidential candidate Ron DeSantis (BA, 2001)\n* ![Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig (JD, 1989)](image)\n\nHarvard law professor Lawrence Lessig (JD, 1989)\n* ![Former Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz (LLB, 1962)](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n30. **^** Pak, Michael S.

There was a mood of alarm and mistrust, and, while the crisis was developing, the presidents of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton developed a project to reform the sport and forestall possible radical changes forced by government upon the sport. Presidents Arthur Hadley of Yale, A. Lawrence Lowell of Harvard, and Woodrow Wilson of Princeton worked to develop moderate reforms to reduce injuries. Their attempts, however, were reduced by rebellion against the rules committee and the formation of the Intercollegiate Athletic Association. While the big three had attempted to operate independently of the majority, the changes pushed did reduce injuries.[39]\n\n\n\n#### Expansion[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Penn identifies as the fourth oldest institution of higher education in the United States, though this representation is challenged by other universities, as Franklin first convened the Board of Trustees in 1749, arguably making it the fifth oldest institution of higher education in the U.S.[note 2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n51. **^** \"Presidents of Penn Alumni\". *www.archives.upenn.edu*.

The explanation, \"It will have been noted that 1740 is the date of the creation of the earliest of the many educational trusts the University has taken upon itself,\" is Professor Cheyney's justification (pp. 47\u201348) for Penn retroactively changing its founding date, not language used by the Board of Trustees.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEven Penn's account of its early history agrees that the Academy of Philadelphia did not add the College of Philadelphia until 1755, but university officials continue to make it their practice to assert their fourth-oldest place in academic processions. Other American universities that began in the colonial era, such as St. John's College, which was founded as King William's School in 1696, and the University of Delaware, which was founded as the Free Academy in 1743, choose to utilize the dates they became institutions of higher learning. Penn history professor Edgar Potts Cheyney was a member of the Penn class of 1883 who played a leading role in the 1896\u20131899 alumni campaign to change the university's formal founding date. According to Cheyney's later recollection, the university considered its founding date to be 1749 for almost a century. However, it was changed with good reason, and primarily due to a publication about the university issued by the U.S. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1802, the university moved to the unused Presidential Mansion at Ninth and Market Streets, a building that both George Washington and John Adams had declined to occupy while Philadelphia was the nation's capital.[34]\n\n\nAmong the classes given in 1807 at this building were those offered by Benjamin Rush, a professor of chemistry, medical theory, and clinical practice who was also a signer of the United States Declaration of Independence, member of the Continental Congress,[62][63] and surgeon general of the Continental Army.[64] \nClasses were held in the mansion until 1829 when it was demolished. Architect William Strickland designed twin buildings on the same site, College Hall[note 8] and Medical Hall (both 1829\u20131830), which formed the core of the Ninth Street Campus until Penn's move to West Philadelphia in the 1870s.\n\n\n\n### West Philadelphia campus[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe College Houses include W.E.B. Du Bois, Fisher Hassenfeld, Gregory, Gutmann, Harnwell, Harrison, Hill College House, Kings Court English, Lauder, Riepe, Rodin, Stouffer, and Ware. The first College House was Van Pelt College House, established in the fall of 1971. It was later renamed Gregory House.[149] Fisher Hassenfeld, Ware and Riepe together make up one building called \"The Quad\". The latest College House to be built is Guttman[150] (formerly named New College House West), which opened in the fall of 2021.[151]\n\n\nPenn students in Junior or Senior year may live in the 45 sororities and fraternities governed by three student-run governing councils, Interfraternity Council,[152] Intercultural Greek Council, and Panhellenic Council.[153]\n\n\n\n* ![](image)\n\nThe university's first purpose-built dormitory in the foreground (on right), built in 1765[154]\n* ![](image)\n\nThe Upper Quad, originally called The Triangle,[155] and formerly \"The Men's Dormitory\", viewed from the Memorial Tower[156]\n* ![](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy July 7, 1778, the Second Continental Congress returned to Philadelphia with the requisite quorum, but convened at College Hall since Independence Hall was damaged by the British attack, briefly establishing Penn's campus as one of the early capitals of the United States.[58][59] Penn's brief status as the nation's capital is evidenced by a July 13, 1778, letter sent from Josiah Bartlett, a signatory to the Articles of Confederation and the Declaration of Independence, to John Langdon, who was also a Founding Father from New Hampshire. Langdon, who later became a signatory of the United States Constitution, wrote: \"The Congress meets in the College Hall[note 7] as the State House was left by the enemy in a most filthy and sordid situation, as were many of the public and private buildings in the City.\"[60]\n\n\n\n### 9th Street campus[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n36. **^** \"Gazette: Building Penn's Brand (Sept/Oct 2002)\". *www.upenn.edu*.

The ideas and intellectual inspiration for the academic institution stem from 1749, with a pamphlet published by Benjamin Franklin (1705/1706\u20131790). When Franklin's institution was established, it inhabited a schoolhouse built on November 14, 1740, for another school, which never came to practical fruition.[2] Penn archivist Mark Frazier Lloyd noted, \"In 1899, UPenn's Trustees adopted a resolution that established 1740 as the founding date, but good cases may be made for 1749, when Franklin first convened the Trustees, or 1751, when the first classes were taught at the affiliated secondary school for boys, Academy of Philadelphia, or 1755, when Penn obtained its collegiate charter to add a post-secondary institution, the College of Philadelphia.\"[3] Princeton's library presents another diplomatically-phrased view.[4]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)A c.\u20091815 illustration of the Ninth Street campus of the University of Pennsylvania, including the medical department (on left) and the college building (on right), which was originally intended to serve as the residence for the President of the United States before the national capital was moved from Philadelphia to Washington, D.C. in 1800\n![](image)A ticket to an 1807 lecture by Benjamin Rush, then a professor at Penn's Department of Medicine[61]\n![](image)The Ninth Street Campus, located on the west side of Ninth Street between Market and Chestnut Streets, and a hand-colored lithograph created in 1842 by John Caspar Wild of Medical Hall (on left) and College Hall (on right), both built between 1829 and 1830\n![](image)The Ninth Street Campus above Chestnut Street and Medical Hall just prior to the university's 1871 move to its current location in West Philadelphia\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFrancis Hopkinson, signed the Declaration of Independence and designed the first official American flag.\n* ![George Clymer, Founding Father; early advocate for complete independence from Britain](image)\n\nGeorge Clymer, Founding Father; early advocate for complete independence from Britain\n* ![Benjamin Rush, Founding Father; surgeon general of the Continental Army](image)\n\nBenjamin Rush, Founding Father; surgeon general of the Continental Army\n* ![William Henry Harrison, 9th president of the United States](image)\n\nWilliam Henry Harrison, 9th president of the United States\n* ![Donald Trump, 45th president of the United States](image)\n\nDonald Trump, 45th president of the United States\n* ![Joe Biden, 46th President of the United States, 47th Vice President of the United States, Benjamin Franklin Presidential Practice Professor[497]](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)A 1765 admission ticket to \"A Course of Lectures\" given by Dr. John Morgan, the founder and first professor of medicine at Penn's Medical School\nThe University of Pennsylvania considers itself the first university in the United States with both undergraduate and graduate studies, though that claim is contested by other universities.

In the charged political climate of the American Revolution, his chief opponent in discussions at the college was an undergraduate of the class of 1777, Alexander Hamilton.[66]:\u200a3 The Irish anatomist, Samuel Clossy, was appointed professor of natural philosophy in October 1765 and later the college's first professor of anatomy in 1767.[69] The American Revolutionary War broke out in 1776, and was catastrophic for the operation of King's College, which suspended instruction for eight years beginning in 1776 with the arrival of the Continental Army. The suspension continued through the military occupation of New York City by British troops until their departure in 1783. The college's library was looted and its sole building requisitioned for use as a military hospital first by American and then British forces.[70][71]\n\n\n\n### 18th century[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** This figure does not include the Columbia University School of General Studies, which, though technically an undergraduate school of the university, is generally not counted as such when calculating undergraduate student body size and admission rates as it involves mainly non-traditional students.

Prior to serving at the university, Johnson had participated in the First Continental Congress and been chosen as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention.[73] For a period in the 1790s, with New York City as the federal and state capital and the country under successive Federalist governments, a revived Columbia thrived under the auspices of Federalists such as Hamilton and Jay. President George Washington and Vice President John Adams, in addition to both houses of Congress attended the college's commencement on May 6, 1789, as a tribute of honor to the many alumni of the school who had been involved in the American Revolution.[65]:\u200a74\n\n\n\n### 19th century to present[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n3. **^** Three presidents have attended Columbia: Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin D.

In 1751, the assembly appointed a commission of ten New York residents, seven of whom were members of the Church of England, to direct the funds accrued by the state lottery towards the foundation of a college.[64]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe president of Columbia University, who is selected by the trustees in consultation with the executive committee of the University Senate and who serves at the trustees' pleasure, is the chief executive officer of the university.

The university's first charter was granted in 1754 by King George II; however, its modern charter was first enacted in 1787 and last amended in 1810 by the New York State Legislature. The university is governed by 24 trustees, customarily including the president, who serves *ex officio*. The trustees themselves are responsible for choosing their successors. Six of the 24 are nominated from a pool of candidates recommended by the Columbia Alumni Association. Another six are nominated by the board in consultation with the executive committee of the University Senate. The remaining 12, including the president, are nominated by the trustees themselves through their internal processes. The term of office for trustees is six years.

In 1857, the college moved from the King's College campus at Park Place to a primarily Gothic Revival campus on 49th Street and Madison Avenue, where it remained for the next forty years.

In 1979, these faculties were merged into the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.[92] In 1991, the faculties of Columbia College, the School of General Studies, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the School of the Arts, and the School of Professional Studies were merged into the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, leading to the academic integration and centralized governance of these schools.

Dunning, I. I. Rabi, Enrico Fermi and Polykarp Kusch placed Columbia's physics department in the international spotlight in the 1940s after the first nuclear pile was built to start what became the Manhattan Project.[77] In 1928, Seth Low Junior College was established by Columbia University in order to mitigate the number of Jewish applicants to Columbia College.[63][78] The college was closed in 1936 due to the adverse effects of the Great Depression and its students were subsequently taught at Morningside Heights, although they did not belong to any college but to the university at large.[79][80]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nScholarships are also given to undergraduate students by the admissions committee. Designations include John W. Kluge Scholars, John Jay Scholars, C. Prescott Davis Scholars, Global Scholars, Egleston Scholars, and Science Research Fellows. Named scholars are selected by the admission committee from first-year applicants. According to Columbia, the first four designated scholars \"distinguish themselves for their remarkable academic and personal achievements, dynamism, intellectual curiosity, the originality and independence of their thinking, and the diversity that stems from their different cultures and their varied educational experiences\".[132]\n\n\nIn 1919, Columbia established a student application process characterized by *The New York Times* as \"the first modern college application\". The application required a photograph of the applicant, the maiden name of the applicant's mother, and the applicant's religious background.[133]\n\n\n\n### Organization[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Bishop Dubois HS\n* De La Salle Institute\n* Mother Cabrini HS\n* Power Memorial Acad\n* Rice HS\n* St. Agnes Boys HS\n* St. Ann Academy\n* St. Michael Acad\n\n\nOther\n\n* Anglo American\n* Baldwin\n* Fourteenth Ward Industrial\n* Franklin\n* McBurney\n* New Lincoln\n* New Walden Lincoln\n* Walden\n |\n\n |\n| Tertiary/Other schools | City University of New York\n\n* Baruch\n\t+ Public and International Affairs\n* Manhattan\n* City College\n\t+ Medicine\n* Graduate\n* Journalism\n* Labor and Urban Studies\n* Professional Studies\n* Public Health\n* Guttman\n* Hunter College\n\t+ Nursing\n* John Jay Criminal Justice\n\n\nState University of New York\n\n* Fashion Institute of Technology\n* State University of New York College of Optometry\n\n\nIndependent\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Columbia Graduate/Professional Schools[134] |\n| --- |\n| **College/school** | **Year founded** |\n| Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons | 1767\n |\n| College of Dental Medicine | 1852\n |\n| Columbia Law School | 1858\n |\n| Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science | 1864\n |\n| Columbia Graduate School of Arts and Sciences | 1880\n |\n| Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation | 1881\n |\n| Teachers College, Columbia University (affiliate) | 1887\n |\n| Columbia University School of Nursing | 1892\n |\n| Columbia University School of Social Work | 1898\n |\n| Graduate School of Journalism | 1912\n |\n| Columbia Business School | 1916\n |\n| Mailman School of Public Health | 1922\n |\n| School of International and Public Affairs | 1946\n |\n| School of the Arts | 1965\n |\n| School of Professional Studies | 1995\n |\n| Columbia Climate School | 2021\n |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWellington Koo: acting President of the Republic of China; judge of the International Court of Justice \u2014 Columbia College, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences\n* ![B.

In 1766, the college authorized the Reverend Morgan Edwards to travel to Europe to \"solicit Benefactions for this Institution\".[32] During his year-and-a-half stay in the British Isles, Edwards secured funding from benefactors including Thomas Penn and Benjamin Franklin.[32]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n> The Philadelphia Association obtained such an acquaintance with our affairs, as to bring them to an apprehension that it was practicable and expedient to erect a college in the Colony of Rhode-Island, under the chief direction of the Baptists; ...

Stiles' first draft was read to the General Assembly in August 1763, and rejected by Baptist members who worried that their denomination would be underrepresented in the College Board of Fellows. A revised charter written by Stiles and Ellery was adopted by the Rhode Island General Assembly on March 3, 1764, in East Greenwich.[30]\n\n\n![](image)\nBrown's first president, minister James Manning\n![](image)\nThe Ezra Stiles copy of Brown's 1764 charter\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. **^** Maurice Anthony Biot (1962), William Prager (1966), Hillel Poritsky (1967), Albert E.

To establish a campus, John and Moses Brown purchased a four-acre lot on the crest of College Hill on behalf of the school. The majority of the property fell within the bounds of the original home lot of Chad Brown, an ancestor of the Browns and one of the original proprietors of Providence Plantations.[34] After the college was relocated to the city, work began on constructing its first building.\n\n\nA building committee, organized by the corporation, developed plans for the college's first purpose-built edifice, finalizing a design on February 9, 1770. The subsequent structure, referred to as \"The College Edifice\" and later as University Hall, may have been modeled on Nassau Hall, built 14 years prior at the College of New Jersey. President Manning, an active member of the building process, was educated at Princeton and might have suggested that Brown's first building resemble that of his alma mater.[35]\n\n\n\n#### Brown family[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Following the gift of Nicholas Brown Jr. (Class of 1786), the university was renamed in his honor.\nNicholas Brown, John Brown, Joseph Brown, and Moses Brown were instrumental in moving the college to Providence, constructing its first building, and securing its endowment. Joseph became a professor of natural philosophy at the college; John served as its treasurer from 1775 to 1796; and Nicholas Sr's son Nicholas Brown Jr. succeeded his uncle as treasurer from 1796 to 1825.[36]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1904, the John Carter Brown Library was established as an independently funded research library on Brown's campus; the library's collection was founded on that of John Carter Brown, son of Nicholas Brown Jr.\n\n\nThe Brown family was involved in various business ventures in Rhode Island, and accrued wealth both directly and indirectly from the transatlantic slave trade. The family was divided on the issue of slavery. John Brown had defended slavery, while Moses and Nicholas Brown Jr. were fervent abolitionists.\n\n\nIn 2003, under the tenure of President Ruth Simmons, the university established a steering committee to investigate these ties of the university to slavery and recommend a strategy to address them.[38]\n\n\n\n#### American Revolution[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n> That your Petitioners propose to open a literary institution or School for instructing young Gentlemen in the Languages, Mathematics, Geography & History, & such other branches of Knowledge as shall be desired.

Stiles and Ellery later served as co-authors of the college's charter two years later.

Upon its 1971 merger with the College of Brown University, Pembroke's campus was absorbed into the larger Brown campus. The Pembroke campus is bordered by Meeting, Brown, Bowen, and Thayer Streets and sits three blocks north of Brown's central campus. The campus is dominated by brick architecture, largely of the Georgian and Victorian styles. The west side of the quadrangle comprises Pembroke Hall (1897), Smith-Buonanno Hall (1907), and Metcalf Hall (1919), while the east side comprises Alumnae Hall (1927) and Miller Hall (1910). The quadrangle culminates on the north with Andrews Hall (1947).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Cammarian Club was at first a semi-secret society that \"tapped\" 15 seniors each year. In 1915, self-perpetuating membership gave way to popular election by the student body, and thenceforward the club served as the *de facto* undergraduate student government. The organization was dissolved in 1971 and ultimately succeeded by a formal student government.\n\n\nSocietas Domi Pacificae, known colloquially as \"Pacifica House\", is a present-day, self-described secret society.

The Pronouncing Society is mentioned in the diary of Solomon Drowne, class of 1773, who was voted its president in 1771.[11] The organization seems to have disappeared during the American Revolutionary War. Subsequent societies include the Misokosmian Society (est. 1798 and renamed the Philermenian Society), the Philandrian Society (est. 1799), the United Brothers (1806), the Philophysian Society (1818), and the Franklin Society (1824). Societies served social as well as academic purposes, with many supporting literary debate and amassing large libraries.[199][200] Older societies generally aligned with Federalists while younger societies generally leaned Republican.[11]\n\n\nSocieties remained popular into the 1860s, after which they were largely replaced by fraternities.[200]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe university comprises the College, the Graduate School, Alpert Medical School, the School of Engineering, the School of Public Health and the School of Professional Studies.

The university is surrounded by a federally listed architectural district with a dense concentration of Colonial-era buildings. Benefit Street, which runs along the campus's western edge, has one of America's richest concentrations of 17th- and 18th-century architecture.[14][15] Brown's undergraduate admissions are among the most selective in the country, with an overall acceptance rate of 5% for the class of 2026.[16][17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Colors | Seal brown,\u00a0cardinal red,\u00a0and\u00a0white[5]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 |\n| Nickname | Bears |\n| Sporting affiliations\n | * NCAA Division I FCS \u2013 Ivy League\n* ECAC Hockey\n* EARC\n* EAWRC\n* NEISA\n* CWPA\n* IRA\n |\n| Mascot | Bruno the Bear |\n| Website | www.brown.edu |\n| ![](image) |\n\n\n**Brown University** is a private Ivy League research university in Providence, Rhode Island.

During the subsequent American Revolutionary War, Brown's University Hall was used to house French and other revolutionary troops led by General George Washington and the Comte de Rochambeau as they waited to commence the march of 1781 that led to the Siege of Yorktown and the Battle of the Chesapeake. This has been celebrated as marking the defeat of the British and the end of the war. The building functioned as barracks and hospital from December 10, 1776, to April 20, 1780, and as a hospital for French troops from June 26, 1780, to May 27, 1782.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Modes of Thought course was discontinued early on, but the other elements remain in place.

Established in 1769 by Eleazar Wheelock, it is one of the nine colonial colleges chartered before the American Revolution. Although originally established to educate Native Americans in Christian theology and the English way of life, the university primarily trained Congregationalist ministers during its early history before it gradually secularized. Emerging into national prominence at the turn of the 20th century, Dartmouth was considered to be the most prestigious undergraduate college in the United States in the early 1900s.[8][9] While Dartmouth is now a research university rather than simply an undergraduate college, it continues to go by \"Dartmouth College\" to emphasize its focus on undergraduate education.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDartmouth alumni in academia include Stuart Kauffman and Jeffrey Weeks, both recipients of MacArthur Fellowships (commonly called \"genius grants\").[264][265] Dartmouth has also graduated three Nobel Prize winners with four separate prizes: Owen Chamberlain (Physics, 1959),[266] K. Barry Sharpless (Chemistry, 2001 and 2022),[267] and George Davis Snell (Physiology or Medicine, 1980).[268] Educators include founder and first president of Bates College Oren Burbank Cheney (1839);[269] the current chancellor of the University of California, San Diego, Marye Anne Fox (PhD. in Chemistry, 1974);[270] founding president of Vassar College Milo Parker Jewett;[271] founder and first president of Kenyon College Philander Chase;[272] first professor of Wabash College Caleb Mills;[273] president of Union College Charles Augustus Aiken.[274][275] Nine of Dartmouth's 17 presidents were alumni of the college.[276]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n101. **^** \"Board of trustees vote to change how Dartmouth College is run\". *The Boston Globe*.

The funds for the Charity School for Native Americans that preceded Dartmouth College were raised primarily by the efforts of a Mohegan named Samson Occom, and at least some of those funds were used to help found the college.[199]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n159. **^** \"Robinson Hall\".

An institution called Dartmouth University occupied the college buildings and began operating in Hanover in 1817, though the college continued teaching classes in rented rooms nearby.[22] Daniel Webster, an alumnus of the class of 1801, presented the college's case to the Supreme Court, which found the amendment of Dartmouth's charter to be an illegal impairment of a contract by the state and reversed New Hampshire's takeover of the college. Webster concluded his peroration with the famous words: \"It is, Sir, as I have said, a small college.

The trustees commissioned a new set of dies with a date of \"1769\" to replace the old dies, now badly worn after almost two hundred years of use.[212] The 1957 design continues to be used under trademark number 2305032.[217]\n\n\n\n### Shield[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Lithograph of the President's House, Thornton Hall, Dartmouth Hall, and Wentworth HallPresidents Ernest Fox Nichols (1909\u201316) and Ernest Martin Hopkins (1916\u201345) continued Tucker's trend of modernization, further improving campus facilities and introducing selective admissions in the 1920s.[30] In 1945, Hopkins was subject to no small amount of controversy, as he openly admitted to Dartmouth's practice of using racial quotas to deny Jews entry into the university.[33][34] John Sloan Dickey, serving as president from 1945 until 1970, strongly emphasized the liberal arts, particularly public policy and international relations.[30][35] During World War II, Dartmouth was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a navy commission.[36]\n\n\nThe Dartmouth workshop, which was held in 1956, is widely considered to be the founding event of artificial intelligence as a field.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n17. **^** \"Dartmouth alumni seek national, state political offices\". *The Dartmouth*.

The four schools met at the Fifth Avenue Hotel in Manhattan on October 19, 1873, to establish a set of rules governing their intercollegiate competition, and particularly to codify the new game of football. Although invited, Harvard chose not to attend.[167] In the early years of intercollegiate athletics, the schools that participated in these athletic events were located solely in the American Northeast.

As a result, classes and research were suspended until a tentative agreement was reached on April 15, 2023.[56][57] Five months later, in September, the university's faculty senate voted \"no confidence\" in Holloway; in addition to issues related to the strikes, the motion also cited Halloway's decision to dismiss the chancellor of the university's Newark campus and his proposal to merge the university's two medical schools.[58]\n\n\n\n## Organization and administration[edit]\n\n\n### University president[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Rutgers University presidents\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSeven alumni have served as New Jersey governor;[d] two as president of Rutgers;[e] Garret A.

Early trustees considered merging the college with the College of New Jersey, in Princeton, but the measure failed by one vote. They later considered relocating it to New York City.[24][25] In 1808, after raising $12,000, the college temporarily reopened and broke ground on a building of its own, called \"Old Queens,\" designed by architect John McComb, Jr.[29] The college's third president, the Rev. Ira Condict, laid the cornerstone on April 27, 1809. Shortly after, the New Brunswick Theological Seminary, founded in 1784, relocated from Brooklyn, to New Brunswick, and shared facilities with Queen's College and the Queen's College Grammar School, and all three institutions were then overseen by the Reformed Church in America.[24][25] During those formative years, all three institutions fit into Old Queens. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n60. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Frusciano, Thomas J. \"Leadership on the Banks: Rutgers' Presidents, 1766\u20132004\", in *The Journal of the Rutgers University Libraries* LIII(1) (June 1991).\n61. **^** Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey.

The initial reluctance of the trustees (still acting as a private corporate body) to cede control of certain business affairs to the state government for direction and oversight caused the state to establish the Board of governors in 1956.[71] Today, the board of governors maintains much of the corporate control of the university.[72]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n50. **^** \"2016 Commencement Speaker | University Commencement\". *commencement.rutgers.edu*.

Later, University College (1945) was founded to serve part-time, commuting students and Livingston College (1969) was created by the Rutgers Trustees, ensuring that the interests of ethnically diverse New Jersey students were met.[24][25]\n\n\nRutgers was designated the state university of New Jersey by acts of the New Jersey Legislature in 1945 and 1956.[32] Although Rutgers thus became a public university, it still retains\u2014as the successor to the private college founded and chartered in 1766\u2014some important private rights and protections from unilateral state efforts to change its fundamental character and mission.[33]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Scarlet Knights maintain athletic rivalries with other collegiate institutions. The university has historic rivalries with Princeton University, Columbia University (formerly *King's College*), Lafayette College, Lehigh University, and New York University originating from the early days of college football. While they maintain this rivalry in other sports, neither of them has met in football since 1980. Rutgers has a basketball rivalry with Seton Hall University.[180] Penn State and the University of Maryland are the two schools with which Rutgers was developing rivalries within the Big Ten.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLike many colleges founded in the U.S. during this time, Rutgers benefited from slave labor and funds derived from purchasing and selling slaves. Research undertaken at the university in the 2010s began to uncover and document these connections, including the university's foundation on land taken from the indigenous Lenape people.[28]\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Henry Rutgers\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nRutgers University\n |\n| --- |\n| **Located in**: New Brunswick, Newark, and Camden, New Jersey\n |\n| History | * History\n* Traditions\n\t+ \"On the Banks of the Old Raritan\"\n* 2023 strike\n |\n| People | * Alumni & Faculty\n* Presidents\n* Henry Rutgers (benefactor)\n* Jonathan Holloway (current president)\n* University Police\n |\n| Research | * BioMaPS Institute for Quantitative Biology\n* Center for Advanced Biotechnology and Medicine\n* Center of Alcohol Studies\n* Center for Urban Policy Research\n* Computationally Advanced Infrastructure Partnerships Center\n* Eagleton Institute of Politics\n* Institute of Jazz Studies\n* Institute of Marine and Coastal Sciences\n* National Transit Institute\n* New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station\n* Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences\n* Rutgers Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences\n* Rutgers Cooperative Extension\n* Rutgers University Press\n* Waksman Institute of Microbiology\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2007, Rutgers New Brunswick, Douglass, Livingston, and University Colleges, along with the Faculty of Arts and Sciences were merged into the new \"School of Arts and Sciences\" with one set of admissions criteria, curriculum, and graduation requirements.

As a result of the separation of the medical school from Rutgers University, Ph.D. programs that had been started in the medical center were lost, and students had to seek other institutions to finish their degrees.

The Board elects a Rector, Vice-Rector, and Secretary and the Board meets four times annually.[50] The Board is responsible for appointing a president, related administrative officers, and an honorary chancellor, approving degrees, admission policies, departments, and schools, and executing the fiduciary duties of supervising the college's property and finances.[51]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThough a historically small college, the alumni of William & Mary are a variety of highly influential and historically significant people, among which include: four of the first ten presidents of the United States,[141] four United States Supreme Court justices, dozens of U.S. senators, members of government, six Rhodes Scholars,[142] and three Marshall Scholars.[143]\n\n\n\n* ![9th U.S. Secretary of State, statesman, abolitionist, and Founder of the Whig Party, Henry Clay (Class of 1797)](image)\n\n9th U.S. Secretary of State, statesman, abolitionist, and Founder of the Whig Party, Henry Clay (Class of 1797)\n* ![Commanding General of the U.S. Army, Winfield Scott (1805, attended)](image)\n\nCommanding General of the U.S. Army, Winfield Scott (1805, attended)\n* ![10th U.S. President, John Tyler (Class of 1807)](image)\n\n10th U.S. President, John Tyler (Class of 1807)\n* ![22nd United States Secretary of Defense and 24th Chancellor, Robert Gates (Class of 1965)](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Colonial Williamsburg\n* Highland\n* *I Am the College*\n* Rich Neck Plantation\n* Royal Hospital School\n* SS *William and Mary Victory*\n* City of Williamsburg\n |\n| * Categories: Wikipedia\n* Commons\n |\n\n| Articles related to College of William & Mary\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nCoastal Athletic Association\n |\n| --- |\n| Current members | * Campbell Fighting Camels\n* Charleston Cougars\n* Delaware Fightin' Blue Hens (*leaving in 2025*)\n* Drexel Dragons\n* Elon Phoenix\n* Hampton Pirates and Lady Pirates\n* Hofstra Pride\n* Monmouth Hawks\n* Northeastern Huskies\n* North Carolina A&T Aggies\n* Stony Brook Seawolves\n* Towson Tigers\n* UNC Wilmington Seahawks\n* William & Mary Tribe\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Lacrosse associates | * Fairfield Stags\n |\n| Women's rowing associates | * Eastern Michigan Eagles\n* UC San Diego Tritons\n* UConn Huskies\n* Villanova Wildcats\n |\n| History | * 2010\u20132013 Colonial Athletic Association realignment\n* 2021\u20132024 NCAA conference realignment\n |\n| Related | * CAA Football\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Chancellor of the College of William & Mary is largely a ceremonial role. Until 1776, the position was held by an English subject, usually the Archbishop of Canterbury or the Bishop of London, who served as the college's advocate to the Crown, while a colonial President oversaw the day-to-day activities of the Williamsburg campus. Following the Revolutionary War, General George Washington was appointed as the first American chancellor; later United States President John Tyler held the post. The college has recently had several distinguished chancellors: former Chief Justice of the United States Warren E. Burger (1986\u20131993), former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher (1993\u20132000), former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger (2000\u20132005), and former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor (2005\u20132012).[52] Former U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert M.

During this time, the college served as a law center and lawmakers frequently used its buildings. It educated future U.S. Presidents Thomas Jefferson, James Monroe, and John Tyler. The college has been called \"the Alma Mater of a Nation\" because of its close ties to America's founding fathers, as well as figures pivotal to the development and expansion of the United States. George Washington, who received his surveyor's license through the college despite never attending, was the college's first American chancellor.

Future U.S. President James Madison was a key figure in the transition to religious freedom in Virginia, and Right Reverend James Madison, his cousin and Thomas Jefferson, who was on the Board of Visitors, helped the College of William & Mary to make the transition as well. In 1779 the college established graduate schools in law and medicine, making it one of the institutions that claims to be the first university in the United States.

In 1736, W&M became the first school of higher education in the future United States to install a student honor code of conduct.[11] It is the only American university issued a coat of arms by the College of Arms in London.[12] The establishment of graduate programs in law and medicine in 1779 makes it one of the first universities in the United States. The Marshall\u2013Wythe School of Law is the oldest law school in the United States, and the Wren Building, attributed to and named for the famed English architect Sir Christopher Wren, is the oldest academic building in continuous use in the United States.[13]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the College of William & Mary\n\n### Colonial era (1693\u20131776)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA school of higher education for both Native American young men and the sons of the colonists was one of the earliest goals of the leaders of the Colony of Virginia. The college was founded on February 8, 1693, under a royal charter to \"make, found and establish a certain Place of Universal Study, a perpetual College of Divinity, Philosophy, Languages, and other good arts and sciences\u00a0... to be supported and maintained, in all time coming.\"[14] Named in honor of the reigning monarchs King William III and Queen Mary II, the college is the second-oldest college in the United States. The original plans for the college date back to 1618 at Henrico but were thwarted by the Indian Massacre of 1622, a change in government (in 1624, the Virginia Company's charter was revoked by King James I and the Virginia Colony was transferred to royal authority as a crown colony), events related to the English Civil War, and Bacon's Rebellion. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1695, before the town of Williamsburg existed, construction began on the College Building, now known as the Sir Christopher Wren Building, in what was then called Middle Plantation (Virginia). It is the oldest college building in America. The college is one of the country's nine Colonial Colleges founded before the American Revolution. The charter named James Blair as the college's first president (a lifetime appointment which he held until his death in 1743). William & Mary was founded as an Anglican institution; students were required to be members of the Church of England, and professors were required to declare adherence to the Thirty-Nine Articles.[15]\n\n\nIn 1693, the college was given a seat in the House of Burgesses and it was determined the college would be supported by tobacco taxes and export duties on furs and animal skins. The college acquired a 330 acres (1.3\u00a0km2) parcel for the new school,[16] 8 miles (13\u00a0km) from Jamestown. In 1694, the new school opened in temporary buildings.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe College of William & Mary is home to the nation's first collegiate secret society, the F.H.C.

Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th century. By the 19th century, Harvard emerged as the most prominent academic and cultural institution among the Boston elite.[10][11] Following the American Civil War, under President Charles William Eliot's long tenure (1869\u20131909), the college developed multiple affiliated professional schools that transformed the college into a modern research university. In 1900, Harvard co-founded the Association of American Universities.[12] James B.

The university's rapid enrollment growth also was a product of both the founding of new graduate academic programs and an expansion of the undergraduate college. Radcliffe College emerged as the female counterpart of Harvard College, becoming one of the most prominent schools for women in the United States. In 1900, Harvard became a founding member of the Association of American Universities.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPresident James B. Conant led the university from 1933 to 1953; Conant reinvigorated creative scholarship in an effort to guarantee Harvard's preeminence among the nation and world's emerging research institutions. Conant viewed higher education as a vehicle of opportunity for the talented rather than an entitlement for the wealthy. As such, he devised programs to identify, recruit, and support talented youth. An influential 268-page report issued by Harvard faculty in 1945 under Conant's leadership, *General Education in a Free Society*, remains one the most important works in curriculum studies.[40]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Links to related articles\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nIvy League\n |\n| --- |\n| Teams | * Brown Bears\n* Columbia Lions\n* Cornell Big Red\n* Dartmouth Big Green\n* Harvard Crimson\n* Penn Quakers\n* Princeton Tigers\n* Yale Bulldogs\n |\n| Competitions | * Baseball\n* Basketball (men's)\n* Basketball (women's)\n* Fencing\n* Rugby\n |\n| Related topics | * Big Three\n* Business schools\n* Digital Network\n* Ivy Council\n* Law schools\n* Medical schools\n* Nude posture photos\n* Public Ivy\n* Public policy schools\n* *Take Ivy*\n* Y Tu Tambien\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nStudent life and activities are generally organized within each school.\n\n\n\n### Student government[edit]\n\n\nThe Undergraduate Council represents College students.

The colleges are led by a head and an academic dean, who reside in the college, and university faculty and affiliates constitute each college's fellowship.

In 1977, Provost Hanna Holborn Gray was appointed interim president of Yale and later went on to become president of the University of Chicago, being the first woman to hold either position at each respective school.[89][90] In 1994, Provost Judith Rodin became the first permanent female president of an Ivy League institution at the University of Pennsylvania.[91] In 2002, Provost Alison Richard became the vice-chancellor of the University of Cambridge.[92] In 2003, the dean of the Divinity School, Rebecca Chopp, was appointed president of Colgate University and later went on to serve as the president of the Swarthmore College in 2009, and then the first female chancellor of the University of Denver in 2014.[93] In 2004, Provost Dr. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n91. **^** Jordan, Mary (December 7, 1993). \"FIRST WOMAN PRESIDENT NAMED IN IVY LEAGUE\". *The Washington Post*.

The feud caused the Mathers to champion the success of the Collegiate School in the hope that it would maintain the Puritan religious orthodoxy in a way that Harvard had not.[18] Rev. Jason Haven, the minister at the First Church and Parish in Dedham, Massachusetts, had been considered for the presidency on account of his orthodox theology and for \"Neatness dignity and purity of Style [which] surpass those of all that have been mentioned\", but was passed over due to his \"very Valetudinary and infirm State of Health\".[19]\n\n\n\n#### Naming and development[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMeanwhile, a Harvard graduate working in England convinced some 180 prominent intellectuals to donate books to Yale. The 1714 shipment of 500 books represented the best of modern English literature, science, philosophy and theology at the time.[22] It had a profound effect on intellectuals at Yale. Undergraduate Jonathan Edwards discovered John Locke's works and developed his original theology known as the \"new divinity\". In 1722 the rector and six of his friends, who had a study group to discuss the new ideas, announced that they had given up Calvinism, become Arminians, and joined the Church of England. They were ordained in England and returned to the colonies as missionaries for the Anglican faith. Thomas Clapp became president in 1745, and while he attempted to return the college to Calvinist orthodoxy, he did not close the library. Other students found Deist books in the library.[23]\n\n\n\n#### Curriculum[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Connecticut Hall, oldest building on the Yale campus, built between 1750 and 1753\n![](image)First diploma awarded by Yale College, granted to Nathaniel Chauncey in 1702\nYale College undergraduates follow a liberal arts curriculum with departmental majors and is organized into a social system of residential colleges.\n\n\nYale was swept up by the great intellectual movements of the period\u2014the Great Awakening and the Enlightenment\u2014due to the religious and scientific interests of presidents Thomas Clap and Ezra Stiles. They were both instrumental in developing the scientific curriculum at Yale while dealing with wars, student tumults, graffiti, \"irrelevance\" of curricula, desperate need for endowment and disagreements with the Connecticut legislature.[24][25][*page\u00a0needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSince the 1960s, John C. Calhoun's white supremacist beliefs and pro-slavery leadership[188][189][190][191] had prompted calls to rename the college or remove its tributes to Calhoun. The racially motivated church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina, led to renewed calls in the summer of 2015 for Calhoun College, one of 12 residential colleges, to be renamed. In July 2015 students signed a petition calling for the name change.[189] They argued in the petition that\u2014while Calhoun was respected in the 19th century as an \"extraordinary American statesman\"\u2014he was \"one of the most prolific defenders of slavery and white supremacy\" in the history of the United States.[189][190] In August 2015, Yale President Peter Salovey addressed the Freshman Class of 2019 in which he responded to the racial tensions but explained why the college would not be renamed.[191] He described Calhoun as \"a notable political theorist, a vice president to two different U.S. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nColleges and universities in Connecticut\n |\n| --- |\n| Public institutions | * Central Connecticut State University\n* Charter Oak State College\n* Eastern Connecticut State University\n* Southern Connecticut State University\n* University of Connecticut\n\t+ Dental\n\t+ Law\n\t+ Medicine\n\t+ UConn Health\n* Western Connecticut State University\n |\n| Private institutions | * Albertus Magnus\n* Connecticut College\n* Fairfield\n* Goodwin\n* Holy Apostles\n* Lyme Academy\n* Mitchell\n* Paier\n* Post\n* Quinnipiac\n\t+ Law\n\t+ Medicine\n* Rensselaer at Hartford\n* Sacred Heart\n* Saint Joseph\n* Trinity\n* Bridgeport\n* Hartford\n* New Haven\n* Wesleyan\n* Yale\n\t+ Law\n\t+ Drama\n\t+ Medicine\n |\n| Federal institutions | * United States Coast Guard Academy\n |\n| Community colleges | * Asnuntuck\n* Capital\n* Gateway\n* Housatonic\n* Manchester\n* Middlesex\n* Naugatuck Valley\n* Northwestern Connecticut\n* Norwalk\n* Quinebaug Valley\n* Three Rivers\n* Tunxis\n |\n| Graduate, professional, andresearch institutions | * Berkeley Divinity\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n96. **^** \"Yale scientist is new president of Wellesley College\".

They concentrated on developing a person possessed of religious values strong enough to sufficiently resist temptations from within, yet flexible enough to adjust to the 'isms' (professionalism, materialism, individualism, and consumerism) tempting him from without.[32][*page\u00a0needed*] William Graham Sumner, professor from 1872 to 1909, taught in the emerging disciplines of economics and sociology to overflowing classrooms of students.

Through the persuasion of Jeremiah Dummer, Yale, who had made a fortune in Madras while working for the East India Company as the first president of Fort St. George (largely through secret contracts with Madras merchants that were illegal under company policy),[20] donated nine bales of goods, which were sold for more than \u00a3560, a substantial sum of money at the time. Cotton Mather suggested that the school change its name to \"Yale College\".[21] The Welsh name Yale is the Anglicized spelling of the I\u00e2l, which the family estate at Plas yn I\u00e2l, near the village of Llandegla, Wales, was called.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nYale is organized into fourteen constituent schools: the original undergraduate college, the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and twelve professional schools.[8] While the university is governed by the Yale Corporation, each school's faculty oversees its curriculum and degree programs.

Their attempts, however, were reduced by rebellion against the rules committee and the formation of the Intercollegiate Athletic Association.

When Franklin's institution was established, it inhabited a schoolhouse built on November 14, 1740, for another school, which never came to practical fruition.[2] Penn archivist Mark Frazier Lloyd noted, \"In 1899, UPenn's Trustees adopted a resolution that established 1740 as the founding date, but good cases may be made for 1749, when Franklin first convened the Trustees, or 1751, when the first classes were taught at the affiliated secondary school for boys, Academy of Philadelphia, or 1755, when Penn obtained its collegiate charter to add a post-secondary institution, the College of Philadelphia.\"[3] Princeton's library presents another diplomatically-phrased view.[4]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)A c.\u20091815 illustration of the Ninth Street campus of the University of Pennsylvania, including the medical department (on left) and the college building (on right), which was originally intended to serve as the residence for the President of the United States before the national capital was moved from Philadelphia to Washington, D.C. in 1800\n![](image)A ticket to an 1807 lecture by Benjamin Rush, then a professor at Penn's Department of Medicine[61]\n![](image)The Ninth Street Campus, located on the west side of Ninth Street between Market and Chestnut Streets, and a hand-colored lithograph created in 1842 by John Caspar Wild of Medical Hall (on left) and College Hall (on right), both built between 1829 and 1830\n![](image)The Ninth Street Campus above Chestnut Street and Medical Hall just prior to the university's 1871 move to its current location in West Philadelphia\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFrancis Hopkinson, signed the Declaration of Independence and designed the first official American flag.\n* ![George Clymer, Founding Father; early advocate for complete independence from Britain](image)\n\nGeorge Clymer, Founding Father; early advocate for complete independence from Britain\n* ![Benjamin Rush, Founding Father; surgeon general of the Continental Army](image)\n\nBenjamin Rush, Founding Father; surgeon general of the Continental Army\n* ![William Henry Harrison, 9th president of the United States](image)\n\nWilliam Henry Harrison, 9th president of the United States\n* ![Donald Trump, 45th president of the United States](image)\n\nDonald Trump, 45th president of the United States\n* ![Joe Biden, 46th President of the United States, 47th Vice President of the United States, Benjamin Franklin Presidential Practice Professor[497]](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)A 1765 admission ticket to \"A Course of Lectures\" given by Dr. John Morgan, the founder and first professor of medicine at Penn's Medical School\nThe University of Pennsylvania considers itself the first university in the United States with both undergraduate and graduate studies, though that claim is contested by other universities.

The suspension continued through the military occupation of New York City by British troops until their departure in 1783. The college's library was looted and its sole building requisitioned for use as a military hospital first by American and then British forces.[70][71]\n\n\n\n### 18th century[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** This figure does not include the Columbia University School of General Studies, which, though technically an undergraduate school of the university, is generally not counted as such when calculating undergraduate student body size and admission rates as it involves mainly non-traditional students.

In 1751, the assembly appointed a commission of ten New York residents, seven of whom were members of the Church of England, to direct the funds accrued by the state lottery towards the foundation of a college.[64]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe president of Columbia University, who is selected by the trustees in consultation with the executive committee of the University Senate and who serves at the trustees' pleasure, is the chief executive officer of the university.

Its official corporate name is \"The Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York\". The university's first charter was granted in 1754 by King George II; however, its modern charter was first enacted in 1787 and last amended in 1810 by the New York State Legislature. The university is governed by 24 trustees, customarily including the president, who serves *ex officio*. The trustees themselves are responsible for choosing their successors.

It was renamed Columbia College in 1784 following the American Revolution, and in 1787 was placed under a private board of trustees headed by former students Alexander Hamilton and John Jay. In 1896, the campus was moved to its current location in Morningside Heights and renamed Columbia University.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn November 1813, the college agreed to incorporate its medical school with The College of Physicians and Surgeons, a new school created by the Regents of New York, forming Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons.[72]:\u200a53\u201360 The college's enrollment, structure, and academics stagnated for the majority of the 19th century, with many of the college presidents doing little to change the way that the college functioned. In 1857, the college moved from the King's College campus at Park Place to a primarily Gothic Revival campus on 49th Street and Madison Avenue, where it remained for the next forty years. During the last half of the 19th century, under the leadership of President F.A.P. Barnard, the president that Barnard College is named after, the institution rapidly assumed the shape of a modern university. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. **^** McCaughey, Robert A.

For much of the 19th century, the university consisted of decentralized and separate faculties specializing in Political Science, Philosophy, and Pure Science. In 1979, these faculties were merged into the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.[92] In 1991, the faculties of Columbia College, the School of General Studies, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the School of the Arts, and the School of Professional Studies were merged into the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, leading to the academic integration and centralized governance of these schools. In 2010, the School of International and Public Affairs, which was previously a part of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, became an independent faculty.[93]\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\n### Morningside Heights[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Columbia Undergraduate Schools[134] |\n| --- |\n| **College/school** | **Year founded** |\n| Columbia College | 1754\n |\n| Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science | 1864\n |\n| Barnard College (affiliate) | 1889\n |\n| Columbia University School of General Studies | 1947\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n74. **^** McCaughey, Robert (December 10, 2003). \"Leading American University Producers of PhDs, 1861\u20131900\". *Stand, Columbia \u2013 A History of Columbia University*.

Brown's first chancellor, Stephen Hopkins, served as a delegate to the Colonial Congress in Albany in 1754, and to the Continental Congress from 1774 to 1776. James Manning represented Rhode Island at the Congress of the Confederation, while concurrently serving as Brown's first president.[39] Two of Brown's founders, William Ellery and Stephen Hopkins signed the Declaration of Independence.\n\n\nJames Mitchell Varnum, who graduated from Brown with honors in 1769, served as one of General George Washington's Continental Army brigadier generals and later as major general in command of the entire Rhode Island militia. Varnum is noted as the founder and commander of the 1st Rhode Island Regiment, widely regarded as the first Black battalion in U.S. military history.[40] David Howell, who graduated with an A.M. in 1769, served as a delegate to the Continental Congress from 1782 to 1785.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n27. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Stiles, Ezra (1916).

To establish a campus, John and Moses Brown purchased a four-acre lot on the crest of College Hill on behalf of the school. The majority of the property fell within the bounds of the original home lot of Chad Brown, an ancestor of the Browns and one of the original proprietors of Providence Plantations.[34] After the college was relocated to the city, work began on constructing its first building.\n\n\nA building committee, organized by the corporation, developed plans for the college's first purpose-built edifice, finalizing a design on February 9, 1770. The subsequent structure, referred to as \"The College Edifice\" and later as University Hall, may have been modeled on Nassau Hall, built 14 years prior at the College of New Jersey. President Manning, an active member of the building process, was educated at Princeton and might have suggested that Brown's first building resemble that of his alma mater.[35]\n\n\n\n#### Brown family[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Following the gift of Nicholas Brown Jr. (Class of 1786), the university was renamed in his honor.\nNicholas Brown, John Brown, Joseph Brown, and Moses Brown were instrumental in moving the college to Providence, constructing its first building, and securing its endowment. Joseph became a professor of natural philosophy at the college; John served as its treasurer from 1775 to 1796; and Nicholas Sr's son Nicholas Brown Jr. succeeded his uncle as treasurer from 1796 to 1825.[36]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1904, the John Carter Brown Library was established as an independently funded research library on Brown's campus; the library's collection was founded on that of John Carter Brown, son of Nicholas Brown Jr.\n\n\nThe Brown family was involved in various business ventures in Rhode Island, and accrued wealth both directly and indirectly from the transatlantic slave trade. The family was divided on the issue of slavery. John Brown had defended slavery, while Moses and Nicholas Brown Jr. were fervent abolitionists.\n\n\nIn 2003, under the tenure of President Ruth Simmons, the university established a steering committee to investigate these ties of the university to slavery and recommend a strategy to address them.[38]\n\n\n\n#### American Revolution[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n> That your Petitioners propose to open a literary institution or School for instructing young Gentlemen in the Languages, Mathematics, Geography & History, & such other branches of Knowledge as shall be desired.

Stiles and Ellery later served as co-authors of the college's charter two years later.

Upon its 1971 merger with the College of Brown University, Pembroke's campus was absorbed into the larger Brown campus. The Pembroke campus is bordered by Meeting, Brown, Bowen, and Thayer Streets and sits three blocks north of Brown's central campus. The campus is dominated by brick architecture, largely of the Georgian and Victorian styles. The west side of the quadrangle comprises Pembroke Hall (1897), Smith-Buonanno Hall (1907), and Metcalf Hall (1919), while the east side comprises Alumnae Hall (1927) and Miller Hall (1910). The quadrangle culminates on the north with Andrews Hall (1947).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Cammarian Club was at first a semi-secret society that \"tapped\" 15 seniors each year. In 1915, self-perpetuating membership gave way to popular election by the student body, and thenceforward the club served as the *de facto* undergraduate student government. The organization was dissolved in 1971 and ultimately succeeded by a formal student government.\n\n\nSocietas Domi Pacificae, known colloquially as \"Pacifica House\", is a present-day, self-described secret society. It purports a continuous line of descent from the Franklin Society of 1824, citing a supposed intermediary \"Franklin Society\" traceable in the nineteenth century.\n\n\n\n### Student organizations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Brown University organizations\n\nThere are over 300 registered student organizations on campus with diverse interests.

Benefit Street, which runs along the campus's western edge, has one of America's richest concentrations of 17th- and 18th-century architecture.[14][15] Brown's undergraduate admissions are among the most selective in the country, with an overall acceptance rate of 5% for the class of 2026.[16][17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Colors | Seal brown,\u00a0cardinal red,\u00a0and\u00a0white[5]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 |\n| Nickname | Bears |\n| Sporting affiliations\n | * NCAA Division I FCS \u2013 Ivy League\n* ECAC Hockey\n* EARC\n* EAWRC\n* NEISA\n* CWPA\n* IRA\n |\n| Mascot | Bruno the Bear |\n| Website | www.brown.edu |\n| ![](image) |\n\n\n**Brown University** is a private Ivy League research university in Providence, Rhode Island. It is the seventh-oldest institution of higher education in the United States, founded in 1764 as the **College in the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations**. One of nine colonial colleges chartered before the American Revolution,[6] it was the first college in the United States to codify in its charter that admission and instruction of students was to be equal regardless of their religious affiliation.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith British vessels patrolling Narragansett Bay in the fall of 1776, the college library was moved out of Providence for safekeeping. During the subsequent American Revolutionary War, Brown's University Hall was used to house French and other revolutionary troops led by General George Washington and the Comte de Rochambeau as they waited to commence the march of 1781 that led to the Siege of Yorktown and the Battle of the Chesapeake. This has been celebrated as marking the defeat of the British and the end of the war. The building functioned as barracks and hospital from December 10, 1776, to April 20, 1780, and as a hospital for French troops from June 26, 1780, to May 27, 1782.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Modes of Thought course was discontinued early on, but the other elements remain in place. In 2006, the reintroduction of plus/minus grading was proposed in response to concerns regarding grade inflation. The idea was rejected by the College Curriculum Council after canvassing alumni, faculty, and students, including the original authors of the Magaziner-Maxwell Report.[47]\n\n\n\n### \"Slavery and Justice\" report[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Slavery Memorial* was designed by Martin Puryear and dedicated in 2014.\nIn 2003, then-university president Ruth Simmons launched a steering committee to research Brown's eighteenth-century ties to slavery.

In total, 65 Black students participated in the walkout. Their principal demand was to increase Black student enrollment to 11% of the student populace, in an attempt to match that of the proportion in the US.

It was one of the nine colonial colleges chartered before the American Revolution. Wheelock's ostensible inspiration for such an establishment resulted from his relationship with Mohegan Indian Samson Occom. Occom became an ordained minister after studying under Wheelock from 1743 to 1747, and later moved to Long Island to preach to the Montauks.[22]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nColleges and universities in New Hampshire\n |\n| --- |\n| Private institutions | * Antioch University New England\n* Colby-Sawyer College\n* Dartmouth College\n* Franklin Pierce University\n* New England College\n\t+ New Hampshire Institute of Art\n* Rivier University\n* Saint Anselm College\n* Southern New Hampshire University\n* Thomas More College of Liberal Arts\n |\n| Public institutions | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Four-year | * University System of New Hampshire\n\t+ Granite State College\n\t+ Keene State College\n\t+ Plymouth State University\n\t+ University of New Hampshire\n |\n| Two-year | * Community College System of New Hampshire (CCSNH)\n\t+ Great Bay Community College\n\t+ Lakes Region Community College\n\t+ Manchester Community College\n\t+ Nashua Community College\n\t+ NHTI \u2013 Concord's Community College\n\t+ River Valley Community College\n\t+ White Mountains Community College\n |\n\n |\n| Defunct institutions | * Daniel Webster College\n* Magdalen College of the Liberal Arts\n* Nathaniel Hawthorne College\n |\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Links to related articles\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nIvy League\n |\n| --- |\n| Teams | * Brown Bears\n* Columbia Lions\n* Cornell Big Red\n* Dartmouth Big Green\n* Harvard Crimson\n* Penn Quakers\n* Princeton Tigers\n* Yale Bulldogs\n |\n| Competitions | * Baseball\n* Basketball (men's)\n* Basketball (women's)\n* Fencing\n* Rugby\n |\n| Related topics | * Big Three\n* Business schools\n* Digital Network\n* Ivy Council\n* Law schools\n* Medical schools\n* Nude posture photos\n* Public Ivy\n* Public policy schools\n* *Take Ivy*\n* Y Tu Tambien\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nEastern Association of Rowing Colleges\n |\n| --- |\n| * BU Terriers\n* Brown Bears\n* Columbia Lions\n* Cornell Big Red\n* Dartmouth Big Green\n* Georgetown Hoyas\n* Harvard Crimson\n* Holy Cross Crusaders\n* MIT Engineers\n* Navy Midshipmen\n* Northeastern Huskies\n* Penn Quakers\n* Princeton Tigers\n* Rutgers Scarlet Knights\n* Syracuse Orange\n* Wisconsin Badgers\n* Yale Bulldogs\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n49. **^** \"Three Leading Research Universities Join the Association of American Universities (AAU)\". *www.aau.edu*.

An institution called Dartmouth University occupied the college buildings and began operating in Hanover in 1817, though the college continued teaching classes in rented rooms nearby.[22] Daniel Webster, an alumnus of the class of 1801, presented the college's case to the Supreme Court, which found the amendment of Dartmouth's charter to be an illegal impairment of a contract by the state and reversed New Hampshire's takeover of the college. Webster concluded his peroration with the famous words: \"It is, Sir, as I have said, a small college.

The four schools met at the Fifth Avenue Hotel in Manhattan on October 19, 1873, to establish a set of rules governing their intercollegiate competition, and particularly to codify the new game of football. Although invited, Harvard chose not to attend.[167] In the early years of intercollegiate athletics, the schools that participated in these athletic events were located solely in the American Northeast. However, by the turn of the 20th century, colleges and universities across the United States began to participate.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n\u2021 *non-football member*\n |\n| Football affiliates | * Christopher Newport Captains\n* Salisbury Sea Gulls\n |\n| Men's tennis affiliates | * State University of New York at Oneonta Red Dragons\n* University of Wisconsin\u2013Eau Claire Blugolds\n* University of Wisconsin\u2013La Crosse Eagles\n* University of Wisconsin\u2013Whitewater Warhawks\n |\n| Track & field affiliates | * Farmingdale State Rams\n* Penn State Harrisburg Lions\n* St. Joseph's\u2013Long Island Golden Eagles\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nEastern Association of Rowing Colleges\n |\n| --- |\n| * BU Terriers\n* Brown Bears\n* Columbia Lions\n* Cornell Big Red\n* Dartmouth Big Green\n* Georgetown Hoyas\n* Harvard Crimson\n* Holy Cross Crusaders\n* MIT Engineers\n* Navy Midshipmen\n* Northeastern Huskies\n* Penn Quakers\n* Princeton Tigers\n* Rutgers Scarlet Knights\n* Syracuse Orange\n* Wisconsin Badgers\n* Yale Bulldogs\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThrough several years of effort by Theodorus Jacobus Frelinghuysen (1691\u20131747) and Jacob Rutsen Hardenbergh (1736\u20131790), later the college's first president, Queen's College received its charter on November 10, 1766, from New Jersey's last royal governor, William Franklin (1730\u20131813), the son of Benjamin Franklin.[23] The original charter established the college under the corporate name **the trustees of Queen's College, in New-Jersey**, named in honor of Queen Charlotte (1744\u20131818), and created both the college and the Queen's College Grammar School, intended to be a preparatory school affiliated and governed by the college.[24] The Grammar School, today the private Rutgers Preparatory School, was a part of the college community until 1959.[24][25] New Brunswick was chosen as the location over Hackensack because the New Brunswick Dutch had the support of the Anglican population, making the royal charter easier to obtain.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The university's coat of arms, featuring four quarters, a reference to the shields of the House of Nassau, New Jersey, Queen Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, and Henry Rutgers[22]\n![](image)Old Queens, the oldest building at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey, built between 1809 and 1825; Old Queens houses much of the Rutgers University administration.\nTwo decades after the College of New Jersey, which is now Princeton University, was established in 1746 by the New Light Presbyterians, ministers of the Dutch Reformed Church, seeking autonomy in ecclesiastical affairs in the Thirteen Colonies, sought to establish a college to train those who wanted to become ministers within the church.[23][24]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe members of the board of trustees are voted upon by different constituencies or appointed. \"Two faculty and two students are elected by the University Senate as nonvoting representatives.

As a result, classes and research were suspended until a tentative agreement was reached on April 15, 2023.[56][57] Five months later, in September, the university's faculty senate voted \"no confidence\" in Holloway; in addition to issues related to the strikes, the motion also cited Halloway's decision to dismiss the chancellor of the university's Newark campus and his proposal to merge the university's two medical schools.[58]\n\n\n\n## Organization and administration[edit]\n\n\n### University president[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Rutgers University presidents\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSeven alumni have served as New Jersey governor;[d] two as president of Rutgers;[e] Garret A.

Early trustees considered merging the college with the College of New Jersey, in Princeton, but the measure failed by one vote. They later considered relocating it to New York City.[24][25] In 1808, after raising $12,000, the college temporarily reopened and broke ground on a building of its own, called \"Old Queens,\" designed by architect John McComb, Jr.[29] The college's third president, the Rev. Ira Condict, laid the cornerstone on April 27, 1809. Shortly after, the New Brunswick Theological Seminary, founded in 1784, relocated from Brooklyn, to New Brunswick, and shared facilities with Queen's College and the Queen's College Grammar School, and all three institutions were then overseen by the Reformed Church in America.[24][25] During those formative years, all three institutions fit into Old Queens. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n60. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Frusciano, Thomas J. \"Leadership on the Banks: Rutgers' Presidents, 1766\u20132004\", in *The Journal of the Rutgers University Libraries* LIII(1) (June 1991).\n61. **^** Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey.

The initial reluctance of the trustees (still acting as a private corporate body) to cede control of certain business affairs to the state government for direction and oversight caused the state to establish the Board of governors in 1956.[71] Today, the board of governors maintains much of the corporate control of the university.[72]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n50. **^** \"2016 Commencement Speaker | University Commencement\". *commencement.rutgers.edu*.

Later, University College (1945) was founded to serve part-time, commuting students and Livingston College (1969) was created by the Rutgers Trustees, ensuring that the interests of ethnically diverse New Jersey students were met.[24][25]\n\n\nRutgers was designated the state university of New Jersey by acts of the New Jersey Legislature in 1945 and 1956.[32] Although Rutgers thus became a public university, it still retains\u2014as the successor to the private college founded and chartered in 1766\u2014some important private rights and protections from unilateral state efforts to change its fundamental character and mission.[33]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Scarlet Knights maintain athletic rivalries with other collegiate institutions. The university has historic rivalries with Princeton University, Columbia University (formerly *King's College*), Lafayette College, Lehigh University, and New York University originating from the early days of college football. While they maintain this rivalry in other sports, neither of them has met in football since 1980. Rutgers has a basketball rivalry with Seton Hall University.[180] Penn State and the University of Maryland are the two schools with which Rutgers was developing rivalries within the Big Ten.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLike many colleges founded in the U.S. during this time, Rutgers benefited from slave labor and funds derived from purchasing and selling slaves. Research undertaken at the university in the 2010s began to uncover and document these connections, including the university's foundation on land taken from the indigenous Lenape people.[28]\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Henry Rutgers\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nRutgers University\n |\n| --- |\n| **Located in**: New Brunswick, Newark, and Camden, New Jersey\n |\n| History | * History\n* Traditions\n\t+ \"On the Banks of the Old Raritan\"\n* 2023 strike\n |\n| People | * Alumni & Faculty\n* Presidents\n* Henry Rutgers (benefactor)\n* Jonathan Holloway (current president)\n* University Police\n |\n| Research | * BioMaPS Institute for Quantitative Biology\n* Center for Advanced Biotechnology and Medicine\n* Center of Alcohol Studies\n* Center for Urban Policy Research\n* Computationally Advanced Infrastructure Partnerships Center\n* Eagleton Institute of Politics\n* Institute of Jazz Studies\n* Institute of Marine and Coastal Sciences\n* National Transit Institute\n* New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station\n* Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences\n* Rutgers Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences\n* Rutgers Cooperative Extension\n* Rutgers University Press\n* Waksman Institute of Microbiology\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2007, Rutgers New Brunswick, Douglass, Livingston, and University Colleges, along with the Faculty of Arts and Sciences were merged into the new \"School of Arts and Sciences\" with one set of admissions criteria, curriculum, and graduation requirements.

In 1971, the governor's office separated Rutgers Medical School from Rutgers University and made it part of New Jersey College of Medicine and Dentistry, and many faculty left the medical school, including the dean of the medical school, Dewitt Stetten, who later became the director of the National Institutes of Health. As a result of the separation of the medical school from Rutgers University, Ph.D. programs that had been started in the medical center were lost, and students had to seek other institutions to finish their degrees. After the dissolution of the University of Medicine and Dentistry in 2013, the medical school again became part of the university.[34]\n\n\nBefore 1982, separate liberal arts faculties existed in the several separate \"residential colleges\" (Rutgers, Douglass, Livingston, University, and Cook colleges) at Rutgers\u2013New Brunswick.[35]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRutgers University is referred to as \"the birthplace of college football\" as the first intercollegiate football game was held on College Field between Rutgers and Princeton on November 6, 1869, in New Brunswick, New Jersey, on a plot of ground behind where the present-day College Avenue Gymnasium now stands. Rutgers won the game, with a score of 6 runs to Princeton's 4.[25][160][168] According to Parke H.

Until 1776, the position was held by an English subject, usually the Archbishop of Canterbury or the Bishop of London, who served as the college's advocate to the Crown, while a colonial President oversaw the day-to-day activities of the Williamsburg campus. Following the Revolutionary War, General George Washington was appointed as the first American chancellor; later United States President John Tyler held the post.

It included the College of William & Mary, the Richmond Professional Institute, the Norfolk Division of the College of William & Mary, Christopher Newport College, and Richard Bland College.[33] It was dissolved in 1962, with only Richard Bland College remaining officially associated with the College of William and Mary at the present day.\n\n\nIn 1974, Jay Winston Johns willed Highland, the 535-acre (2.17\u00a0km2) historic Albemarle County, Virginia estate of alumnus and U.S. President James Monroe, to the college. The college restored this historic presidential home near Charlottesville and opened it to the public.[34]\n\n\nJefferson Hall, a student dormitory, was destroyed by fire on January 20, 1983, with no casualties.

During this time, the college served as a law center and lawmakers frequently used its buildings. It educated future U.S. Presidents Thomas Jefferson, James Monroe, and John Tyler. The college has been called \"the Alma Mater of a Nation\" because of its close ties to America's founding fathers, as well as figures pivotal to the development and expansion of the United States. George Washington, who received his surveyor's license through the college despite never attending, was the college's first American chancellor. William & Mary is famous for its firsts: the first U.S. institution with a royal charter, the first Greek-letter society (Phi Beta Kappa, founded in 1776), the first collegiate society in the country (F.H.C. Society, founded in 1750), the first student honor code and the first collegiate law school in America.[b][17]\n\n\n\n### Revolution and transition[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCollege of William & Mary| ![](image) |\n| Latin: *Collegium Gulielmi et Mariae* |\n| Type | Royal college (1693\u20131776)  Private college (1776\u20131906)  Public research university |\n| Established | February\u00a08, 1693; 331 years ago\u00a0(1693-02-08)[1][a] |\n| Accreditation | SACS |\n| Religious affiliation\n | Nonsectarian, formerly Church of England |\n| Academic affiliations\n | * ORAU\n* SCHEV\n* URA\n* Sea-grant\n* Space-grant\n |\n| Endowment | $1.3 billion (2021)[2] |\n| Chancellor | Robert Gates |\n| President | Katherine Rowe |\n| Rector | Charles Poston |\n| Academic staff\n | 738 full-time, 183 part-time[3] |\n| Students | 9,517 (Fall 2022)[4] |\n| Undergraduates | 6,543 (Fall 2022)[4] |\n| Postgraduates | 2,974 (Fall 2022)[4] |\n| Location | Williamsburg\n, Virginia\n, United States\n37\u00b016\u203215\u2033N 76\u00b042\u203230\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff37.27083\u00b0N 76.70833\u00b0W\ufeff / 37.27083; -76.70833 |\n| Campus | Small suburb, 1,200 acres (4.9\u00a0km2) |\n| Other campuses | * Gloucester Point\n* Newport News\n* Washington, D.C.\n |\n| Newspaper | *The Flat Hat* |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Board of Visitors delegates to a president the operating responsibility and accountability for the administrative, fiscal, and academic performance of the college as well as representing the college on public occasions such as conferral of degrees.[50] W.

Future U.S. President James Madison was a key figure in the transition to religious freedom in Virginia, and Right Reverend James Madison, his cousin and Thomas Jefferson, who was on the Board of Visitors, helped the College of William & Mary to make the transition as well. In 1779 the college established graduate schools in law and medicine, making it one of the institutions that claims to be the first university in the United States. As its president, Reverend Madison worked with the new leaders of Virginia, most notably Jefferson, on a reorganization and changes for the college which included the abolition of the Divinity School and the Indian School and the establishment of the first elective system of study and honor system.[18]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Other | * Bodleian Plate\n* Carter's Grove Country Road\n* Carter's Grove Plantation\n* College of William & Mary\n\t+ campus\n* Colonial Parkway\n* Grand Illumination\n* Merchants Square\n* National Trust for Historic Preservation\n* Peacock Hill\n* *Williamsburg: The Story of a Patriot*\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nColonial colleges\n |\n| --- |\n| * Brown\n* Columbia\n* Dartmouth\n* Harvard\n* Penn\n* Princeton\n* Rutgers\n* William & Mary\n* Yale\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nPublic Ivy universities\n |\n| --- |\n| Richard Moll's 1985 list\n |\n| Original eight | * William and Mary\n* Miami\n* California\n* Michigan\n* North Carolina\n* Texas\n* Vermont\n* Virginia\n |\n| \"Worthy runners-up\" | * Binghamton\n* Colorado\n* Georgia Tech\n* Illinois\n* New College\n* Pennsylvania State\n* Pittsburgh\n* Washington\n* Wisconsin\n |\n| Greenes' Guides 2001 list\n |\n| Eastern | * Binghamton\n* William and Mary\n* Pennsylvania State\n* Rutgers\n* Connecticut\n* Delaware\n* Maryland\n* North Carolina\n* Vermont\n* Virginia\n |\n| Western | * Arizona\n* California\n\t+ Berkeley\n\t+ Davis\n\t+ Irvine\n\t+ Los Angeles\n\t+ San Diego\n\t+ Santa Barbara\n* Colorado\n* Washington\n |\n| Great Lakes | * Indiana\n* Miami\n* Ohio State\n* Illinois\n* Iowa\n* Michigan\n* Michigan State\n* Minnesota\n* Wisconsin\n |\n| Southern | * Florida\n* Georgia\n* Texas\n |\n |\n\nPortals:* ![](image) British Empire\n* ![flag](image) Virginia\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMore recently, William & Mary recruited the constitutional scholar William Van Alstyne from Duke Law School.

In 1888, William & Mary resumed operations under an amended charter when the Commonwealth of Virginia passed an act[25] appropriating $10,000 to support the college as a teacher-training institution. Lyon Gardiner Tyler (son of US President and alumnus John Tyler) became the 17th president of the college following President Ewell's retirement. Tyler, along with the 18th president J. A. C. Chandler, expanded the college into a modern institution.

The F.H.C. Society, founded in 1750, was the first collegiate fraternity in the United States, and W&M students founded the Phi Beta Kappa academic honor society in 1776, the first Greek-letter fraternity. In 1736, W&M became the first school of higher education in the future United States to install a student honor code of conduct.[11] It is the only American university issued a coat of arms by the College of Arms in London.[12] The establishment of graduate programs in law and medicine in 1779 makes it one of the first universities in the United States. The Marshall\u2013Wythe School of Law is the oldest law school in the United States, and the Wren Building, attributed to and named for the famed English architect Sir Christopher Wren, is the oldest academic building in continuous use in the United States.[13]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the College of William & Mary\n\n### Colonial era (1693\u20131776)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA school of higher education for both Native American young men and the sons of the colonists was one of the earliest goals of the leaders of the Colony of Virginia. The college was founded on February 8, 1693, under a royal charter to \"make, found and establish a certain Place of Universal Study, a perpetual College of Divinity, Philosophy, Languages, and other good arts and sciences\u00a0... to be supported and maintained, in all time coming.\"[14] Named in honor of the reigning monarchs King William III and Queen Mary II, the college is the second-oldest college in the United States. The original plans for the college date back to 1618 at Henrico but were thwarted by the Indian Massacre of 1622, a change in government (in 1624, the Virginia Company's charter was revoked by King James I and the Virginia Colony was transferred to royal authority as a crown colony), events related to the English Civil War, and Bacon's Rebellion. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1695, before the town of Williamsburg existed, construction began on the College Building, now known as the Sir Christopher Wren Building, in what was then called Middle Plantation (Virginia). It is the oldest college building in America. The college is one of the country's nine Colonial Colleges founded before the American Revolution. The charter named James Blair as the college's first president (a lifetime appointment which he held until his death in 1743). William & Mary was founded as an Anglican institution; students were required to be members of the Church of England, and professors were required to declare adherence to the Thirty-Nine Articles.[15]\n\n\nIn 1693, the college was given a seat in the House of Burgesses and it was determined the college would be supported by tobacco taxes and export duties on furs and animal skins. The college acquired a 330 acres (1.3\u00a0km2) parcel for the new school,[16] 8 miles (13\u00a0km) from Jamestown. In 1694, the new school opened in temporary buildings.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe College of William & Mary is home to the nation's first collegiate secret society, the F.H.C. Society, popularly known as the Flat Hat Club, founded on November 11, 1750. On December 5, 1776, students John Heath and William Short (Class of 1779) founded Phi Beta Kappa as a secret literary and philosophical society. Other secret societies known to currently exist at the college include: The 7 Society, 13 Club, Alpha Club, Bishop James Madison Society, The Society, The Spades, W Society, and Wren Society.[19][20]\n\n\nThomas R. Dew, professor of history, metaphysics, and political economy, and then president of William & Mary from 1836 until his death in 1846, was an influential academic defender of slavery.[21]:\u200a21\u201347\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Campus | * Alan B.

The college has a strong undergraduate arts & sciences focus, with a select number of graduate programs in diverse fields ranging from American colonial history to marine science. The college offers four academic programs in its Washington, DC office, an undergraduate joint degree program in engineering with Columbia University, as well as a liberal arts joint degree program with the University of St Andrews in Scotland.[58]\n\n\nThe graduate programs are dominant in STEM fields and the university has a high level of research activity.[57] For the 2016\u201317 academic year, 1,591 undergraduate, 652 masters, and 293 doctoral degrees were conferred.[59] William & Mary is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.[60]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFollowing the George Floyd protests and associated movements as well as student and faculty pressure in 2020 and 2021, several buildings, halls, and other entities were renamed. Maury Hall (named for Confederate sailor Matthew Fontaine Maury) on the Virginia Institute of Marine Science campus and Trinkle Hall (named for Governor Elbert Lee Trinkle) of Campus Center were renamed in September 2020 to York River Hall and Unity Hall respectively.[49] In April 2021, three buildings were renamed at following a vote by the Board of Visitors: Morton Hall (named for professor Richard Lee Morton) to John E. Boswell Hall (for LGBT advocate and alum John Boswell), Taliaferro Hall (named for Confederate General William Taliaferro) to Hulon L. Willis Sr. Hall (Hulon Willis Sr. was the first Black student at the college), and Tyler Hall (named for President John Tyler and his son) to its original name of Chancellors' Hall (the hall had been renamed in 1988).[47]\n\n\n\n## Organization and administration[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTwo other buildings around the Wren Building compose an area known as \"Ancient\" or \"Historic Campus\":[44] the Brafferton (built within 1723 and originally housing the Indian School, now the President and Provost's offices) and the President's House (built within 1732). In addition to the Ancient Campus, which dates to the 18th century, the college also consists of \"Old Campus\" and \"New Campus\".[45] \"Old Campus\", adjacent to Ancient Campus, surrounds the Sunken Garden.[46]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n33. **^** Godson; et\u00a0al.
