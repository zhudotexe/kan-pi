Her mother died by suicide when Lynch was 12 years old.[5] Following her mother‚Äôs death, Lynch and her three siblings were raised by their aunt, who was a single mother with a son of her own.[27][28] In Lynch‚Äôs early 20s, she lost her aunt to breast cancer, lung cancer, and emphysema.[8]\n\n\nLynch is married to Kevin M. Lynch, the founder, president and CEO of the Quell Foundation, a non-profit organization whose mission is to remove the stigma around mental health, reduce the number of suicides, overdoses, and the incarceration of those with mental illness.[8][29]\n\n\nIn an interview given by Lynch in 2020 she said ‚ÄúOutside of work, I make time for physical fitness, and running is one of my favorite past times. Running helps me to unwind and clear my mind‚Äîmany times my greatest ideas come from an exhilarating run.‚Äù[30]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"CVS Health CEO Karen Lynch is the most powerful woman in American business\". *Fortune*.

Brewer** (born 1962) is an American businesswoman, and was the CEO of Walgreens Boots Alliance, before stepping down in September 2023.[1] Brewer is the first woman to become CEO of Walgreens Boots Alliance, group president and COO of Starbucks, and CEO of Sam's Club.[2]\n\n\n*USA Today* referred to her as \"one of corporate America's most prominent women and black female executives.\"[3] Brewer has been called a \"Highly Powerful Woman\" by *Forbes* and *Fortune* magazines.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nRosalind Brewer was born in 1962 in Detroit, Michigan,[4] the youngest of five children; they were the first generation in her family to attend college.[4] Due to her inclination for math and science, Brewer was interested in pursuing a career as a physician.[5]\n\n\nIn 1980, upon graduating from Cass Technical High School in Detroit, Brewer enrolled at Spelman College in Atlanta, Georgia where she completed her bachelor's degree in chemistry.[6][7] She decided not to pursue a career in medicine, and began working at Kimberly-Clark as a research technician.\n\n\nBrewer completed the director's college (executive education) program at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and Stanford Law School, as well as the advanced management program at The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania.[8]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nBrewer has held executive positions at Kimberly-Clark, Walmart, Sam's Club, Starbucks, and Walgreens Boots Alliance. Additionally, in 2019 Brewer was elected and became the only black member of the board of directors at Amazon.[9] She has been a non-executive director at Lockheed Martin and Molson Coors Brewing Company.[8][10] Brewer continues to serve as a member on the board of trustees for Westminster School, the board of councilors for the Carter Presidential Center, and board of trustees chair at Spelman College.[5]\n\n\n\n### Kimberly-Clark (1984-2006)[edit]\n\n\nIn 1984, after graduating from Spelman College, Brewer began her career as a research technician at Kimberly-Clark, a global paper-based product company, till 1988.[11] From 1988 to 1998, she held numerous leadership roles including: market manager, director for Skincare, and vice president for nonwovens.[11] From 1998 and 2006, Brewer served as the president for manufacturing and operations and the global president at Kimberly-Clark.[11] Brewer had a 22 year career at Kimberly-Clark Corporation.[6][7]\n\n\n\n### Walmart and Sam's Club (2006-2017)[edit]\n\n\nBrewer's career with Walmart began in 2006. Brewer served as the vice president, senior vice president, executive vice president for southeastern operations, and executive vice president for the eastern business unit at Walmart stores.[11] Brewer started her position as regional vice president of operations in Georgia. Following her work as the regional vice president of Operations in Georgia, she became the division president of Walmart's southeast market, and finally the president of Walmart East.[12]\n\n\nIn 2012, Brewer left Walmart and became the president and CEO of Sam's Club, the membership-only retail warehouse clubs owned and operated by Walmart.[13][14] She focused on health and wellness by doubling the number of organic products offered at Sam's Clubs.[15] As CEO of Sam‚Äôs Club, Brewer became the first black to lead a Walmart division.[4] She retired from her role at Sam‚Äôs Club in 2017.[4]\n\n\n\n### Starbucks (2017-2021)[edit]\n\n\nOn 1 February 2017, Brewer was nominated for the Starbucks board of directors. On 6 September 2017 was named COO and group president.[16][17][18] Brewer was the second-highest-ranking executive at Starbucks after CEO Kevin Johnson and the first black and the first woman to become the COO and group president of Starbucks.[19][20][21] She led businesses and operations in the United States, Canada, and Latin America.[22]\n\n\n\n### Walgreens Boots Alliance (2021-2023)[edit]\n\n\nOn 15 March 2021, Rosalind Brewer was appointed as the CEO of Walgreens Boots Alliance. Brewer became the only current black woman to lead a Fortune 500 company.[23][24]\nBrewer mutually agreed to step down as CEO in September of 2023 after being in the role for two years.[25]\n\n\n\n### Board of directors memberships[edit]\n\n\nBrewer was a member of the board of directors at Amazon from 2019 to 2021.[9][26] She was a director of Lockheed Martin from 2011 to 2017, and Molson Coors Brewing Company from 2006 to 2011.[8][10][27][28][*excessive citations*]\n\n\n\n## Honors[edit]\n\n\nIn 2020, *Fortune* ranked Brewer the 27th Most Powerful Woman in the World and *Forbes* ranked her 48th in their Worlds 100 Most Powerful Woman.[6][29]\n\n\nOn 15 September 2015, *Fortune* included Brewer in its Most Powerful Woman rankings.[29] *Working Mother* named her one of the Most Powerful Working Moms of 2013.[30]\n\n\nIn 2017, Brewer received the Spelman College Legacy of Leadership award.[31][32]\n\n\nBrewer was selected for the inaugural 2021 *Forbes* 50 Over 50 list of entrepreneurs, leaders, scientists and creators over the age of 50.[33]\n\n\nBrewer was named as one of *USA Today'*s Women of the Year in 2022.[34]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nBrewer is married to John Brewer, and they have two children.[6]\n\n\n\n## Advocacy for diversity and inclusion[edit]\n\n\n### 2015[edit]\n\n\nIn 2015, as CEO of Sam's Club, Brewer was interviewed on CNN by Poppy Harlow. During the interview, Brewer explained that diversity was a priority for her.[19][35] When speaking about the topic, she said, \"I demand it of my team\" and that, \"Every now and then you have to nudge your partners. You have to speak up and speak out. And I try to use my platform for that. I try to set an example.\"[35]\n\n\nBrewer described a specific incident when she was meeting with a supplier, and she recollected, \"the entire other side of the table was all Caucasian male. That was interesting.\"[35] Brewer chose not to address the lack of diversity when meeting with the group, but said she was \"going to make a call\" to the supplier.[35] In response to her comments, Brewer faced repercussions, as many individuals on social media called her \"racist.\"[19]\n\n\nIn support of Brewer's statement, Doug McMillon, Walmart's president and CEO, subsequently wrote in a statement, \"For years, we've asked our suppliers to prioritize the talent and diversity of their sales teams calling on our company, Roz was simply trying to reiterate that we believe diverse and inclusive teams make for a stronger business. That's all there is to it and I support that important ideal.\"[35]\n\n\n\n### 2018[edit]\n\n\nShortly after becoming the COO and group president of Starbucks, the company was met with nationwide protests and negative publicity because of the arrest of two black men at a Philadelphia store location.[36] In response, Brewer and her team implemented policy changes and instituted racial bias training for employees in 8,000 stores.[37][38]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Kavilanz, Parija (2023-09-01). \"Walgreens CEO steps down | CNN Business\". *CNN*.

They lived in Mountain Iron, Minnesota and had three children, including a son named Reino,[8] called Ray. Barra's father, Ray, married a second-generation Finnish American named Eva Pyykk√∂nen, and Mary was born in 1961.\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nBarra graduated from the General Motors Institute (now Kettering University) in 1985, where she obtained a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering.[9][10] Barra was inducted into the engineering honor society Tau Beta Pi[11] (MI Zeta class of 1985) and the honor society IEEE-Eta Kappa Nu (Theta Epsilon chapter 1983) while at Kettering University. She then attended Stanford Graduate School of Business on a GM fellowship, receiving a Master of Business Administration degree in 1990.[12]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### General Motors[edit]\n\n\nBarra started working for General Motors in 1980 as a co-op student when she was 18 years old.[13] Her job was checking fender panels and inspecting hoods, and she used this job to pay for her college tuition.[14] She subsequently held a variety of engineering and administrative positions, including managing the Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly plant.[12]\n\n\nIn February 2008, she became vice president of Global Manufacturing Engineering. In July 2009, she advanced to the position of vice president of Global Human Resources, which she held until February 2011 when she was named executive vice president of Global Product Development.[12][15] The latter position included responsibilities for design; she worked to reduce the number of automobile platforms in GM.[3] In August 2013, her vice president responsibility was extended to include Global Purchasing and Supply Chain.[16]\n\n\nWhen Barra took over as chief executive of General Motors in January 2014, she became the first female head of an automobile manufacturer.[17]\n\n\nDuring her first year as CEO, General Motors issued 84 safety recalls involving over 30 million cars.[18] Barra was called before the Senate to testify about the recalls and deaths attributed to the faulty ignition switch.[19] Barra and General Motors also came under suspicion of paying for awards to burnish the CEO and corporation's image during that time.[20] The recalls led to the creation of new policies encouraging workers to report problems they encounter in an attempt to change company culture.[21]\n\n\nAs CEO, Barra directed GM's move into driverless and electric-powered cars through acquisitions including Strobe, a startup in driverless technology.[22]\n\n\nIn 2017, Barra was the highest paid Detroit Three executive, with a total remuneration of $21.96 million.[23] In November 2018, Barra announced the closure of five North American plants and 14,000 worker layoffs.[24] Her decision was criticized by President Donald Trump, who threatened to remove the company's government subsidies in response.[24]\n\n\nIn a June 2022 question about reinstating dividends at GM, Barra said the company has a \"clear priority\" to \"accelerate our EV plans\" and to solely offer EVs by 2035.[25]\n\n\n\n### Boards and councils[edit]\n\n\nBarra was a member of the General Dynamics board of directors. She serves on the board of directors of the Detroit Economic Club and Detroit Country Day School.[26][27][28] She is a member of the Stanford University Board of Trustees, the Stanford Graduate School of Business Advisory Council, and the Duke University Board of Trustees.[29][30]\n\n\nIn August 2017, she was elected to the board of Disney.[31][32][33] She was the 12th person elected to this board, and the fourth woman.[34]\n\n\nIn March 2022 she was appointed to the Homeland Security Advisory Council by Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas[35]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\nBarra was listed as 35th on *Forbes* Most Powerful Women list in 2013, rising in rank to fourth most powerful in 2018.[36]\n\n\nIn May 2014, she delivered the commencement address for University of Michigan's Ann Arbor campus at Michigan Stadium, and received an honorary degree.[37] In 2018, she received an honorary doctorate from Duke University and in 2022 she delivered the school's commencement address.[38]\n\n\nBarra was ranked first in Fortune's Most Powerful Women list in 2015, up from second the year before.[39]\n\n\nShe remained in the number one spot in Fortune's Most Powerful Women of 2017[40] and Number 5 on Forbes World's 100 Most Powerful Women List in the same year.[41]\n\n\nIn April 2014, Barra was featured on the cover of Time's \"100 Most Influential People in the World.\"[42]\n\n\nIn December 2016, Barra joined a business forum assembled by then President-elect Donald Trump to provide strategic and policy advice on economic issues.[43] However, she left the forum in 2017, following Trump's response to the Charlottesville protests.\n\n\nBarra was honored at the 2023 Arthur W. Page Center Awards [44] where she received a Larry Foster Award for Integrity in Public Communication.\n\n\nBarra was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in February 2018.[45][46] In September 2018, Barra was awarded the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute's Legend in Leadership Award.[47]\n\n\nIn *Institutional Investor*'s yearly survey of top executives, the 2019 All-America Executive Team, Barra achieved the first place in the autos and auto parts sector.[48]\n\n\nBarra was selected for the inaugural 2021 Forbes 50 Over 50; made up of entrepreneurs, leaders, scientists and creators who are over the age of 50.[49] In 2021, she was included in the *Time* 100, *Time*'s annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world.[50]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nBarra is married to consultant Tony Barra, whom she met while studying at Kettering University, and has two children and two dogs.[3] They live in Northville, a suburb of Detroit.
