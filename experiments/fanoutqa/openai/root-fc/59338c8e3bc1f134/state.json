If this tie is for gold or silver, there will be a consequent absence of a silver or bronze medal for that event.\n* Some medals that have been revoked have not been re-awarded.\n* Some early events, such as cricket at the 1900 Summer Olympics, had only two entrants.\n* Retroactively awarding gold, silver, and bronze medals for the 1896 and 1900 games results in some anomalies, such as the 100 metre freestyle swimming event in 1896 where no surviving records distinguish the places of those who finished between 3rd and 10th position.\n\n\n## List of NOCs without medals (sortable & unranked)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe results are attributed to the IOC country code as currently displayed by the IOC database. Usually, a single code corresponds to a single National Olympic Committee (NOC). When different codes are displayed for different years, medal counts are combined in the case of a simple change of IOC code (such as from HOL to NED for the Netherlands) or simple change of country name (such as from Ceylon to Sri Lanka). As the medals are attributed to each NOC, not all totals include medals won by athletes from that country for another NOC, such as before independence of that country. Names in italic are national entities that no longer exist. The totals of NOCs are not combined with those of their predecessors and successors.\n\n\n\n![](image)World map showing nations that have won Summer Olympic medals.\n![](image)World map showing nations that have won Winter Olympic medals.\n\n## List of NOCs with medals (sortable & unranked)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe table is pre-sorted by the name of each Olympic Committee, but can be displayed as sorted by any other column, such as the total number of gold medals or total number of overall medals. To sort by gold, silver, and then bronze, sort first by the bronze column, then the silver, and then the gold. The table does not count revoked medals (e.g., due to doping).\n\n\nA total of 156 current and historical NOCs have earned at least one medal. Medal totals in this table are current through the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, People's Republic of China, and all changes in medal standings due to doping cases and medal redistributions up to 5 May 2023 are taken into account.\n\n\n\nSpecial delegation, not an actual nation\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nLists of Olympic medalists\n |\n| --- |\n| **Summer sports** | * Archery\n* Artistic swimming\n* Athletics\n\t+ men\n\t+ women\n\t+ mixed\n* Badminton\n* Baseball\n* Basketball\n* Boxing\n* Canoeing\n\t+ men\n\t+ women\n* Cycling\n\t+ men\n\t+ women\n* Diving\n* Equestrian\n* Fencing\n\t+ men\n\t+ women\n* Field hockey\n* Football\n* Golf\n* Gymnastics\n\t+ men\n\t+ women\n* Handball\n\t+ men\n\t+ women\n* Judo\n* Karate\n* Modern pentathlon\n* Rowing\n\t+ men\n\t+ women\n* Rugby\n\t+ Rugby sevens\n* Sailing\n\t+ by discipline\n\t+ by class\n* Shooting\n* Skateboarding\n* Sport climbing\n* Softball\n* Surfing\n* Swimming\n\t+ men\n\t+ women\n\t+ mixed\n* Table tennis\n* Taekwondo\n* Tennis\n* Triathlon\n* Volleyball\n* Water polo\n\t+ men\n\t+ women\n* Weightlifting\n* Wrestling\n\t+ freestyle\n\t+ Greco-Roman\n |\n| **Winter sports** | * Alpine skiing\n* Biathlon\n* Bobsleigh\n* Cross-country skiing\n* Curling\n* Figure skating\n* Freestyle skiing\n* Ice hockey\n* Luge\n* Nordic combined\n* Short track speed skating\n* Skeleton\n* Ski jumping\n* Snowboarding\n* Speed skating\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMedal tables of Olympics, Paralympics and World Championships by sport\n |\n| --- |\n| Olympic Games* (Hosts\n* Medals)\n | * Alpine skiing\n* Archery\n* Athletics\n* Badminton\n* Bandy\n* Basketball\n\t+ men\n\t+ women\n* Biathlon\n* Bobsleigh\n* Boxing\n* Canoeing & kayaking\n* Cross-country skiing\n* Curling\n* Cycling\n* Diving\n* Equestrian\n* Field hockey\n* Fencing\n* Figure skating\n* Football\n\t+ men\n\t+ women\n* Freestyle skiing\n* Gymnastics\n* Handball\n* Ice hockey\n* Judo\n* Luge\n* Modern pentathlon\n* Nordic combined\n* Rowing\n* Sailing\n* Shooting\n* Skeleton\n* Ski jumping\n* Snowboarding\n* Speed skating\n\t+ Short track\n* Swimming\n* Synchronized swimming\n* Table tennis\n* Taekwondo\n* Tennis\n* Triathlon\n* Volleyball\n* Water polo\n* Weightlifting\n* Wrestling\n\t+ Greco-Roman\n\t+ Freestyle\n |\n| Paralympic Games* (Hosts\n* Medals)\n | * Alpine skiing\n* Archery\n* Athletics\n* Biathlon\n* Boccia\n* Cross\u2011country skiing\n* Cycling\n* Equestrian\n* Football 5-a-side\n* Football 7-a-side\n* Goalball\n* Ice sledge hockey\n* Judo\n* Powerlifting\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* All-time Paralympic Games medal table\n* All-time Youth Olympic Games medal table\n* Olympic medal table\n* List of first Olympic gold medalists by country\n* List of participating nations at the Summer Olympic Games\n* List of participating nations at the Winter Olympic Games\n* List of multiple Olympic gold medalists\n* List of multiple Olympic gold medalists at a single Games\n* List of multiple Olympic gold medalists in one event\n* List of multiple Olympic medalists\n* List of multiple Olympic medalists at a single Games\n* List of multiple Olympic medalists in one event\n* List of Olympic teams by medals won\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n27. **^** \"All-Time Olympic Games Medal Tally (Summer Olympics)\". *topendsports*.

They were still disadvantaged by these rules in those sports where they weren't abolished (i.e., boxing, baseball, where Cubans continued to field state-sponsored pros against American amateurs), but the situation started improving.\n\n\n\n### Recent period (1994\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**.

American athletes amassed 45 gold and 107 total medals, 16 gold and 16 total medals more than the second-placed Soviets. The US swimming team dominated the competition, winning a staggering 51 medals and sweeping the podium on five occasions. The Americans also managed to medal in every single of 29 swimming events, thus achieving a unique feat. The US track and field team pulled off a stellar performance as well with 15 gold and 28 total medals. Overall, swimming and athletics accounted for more than 70% of all US medals and ensured the first place in the medal table for the Americans, their second consecutive first-place finish in terms of gold medals, and their first finish at the top of the overall medal table since 1952. In other sports, however, the performance of American athletes was less convincing. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 1972 Summer Olympics | Detroit | Munich |\n| 1976 Winter Olympics | Denver | Innsbruck |\n| 1976 Summer Olympics | Los Angeles | Montreal |\n| 1980 Summer Olympics | Los Angeles | Moscow |\n| 1992 Winter Olympics | Anchorage | Albertville |\n| 1994 Winter Olympics | Anchorage | Lillehammer |\n| 1998 Winter Olympics | Salt Lake City | Nagano |\n| 2012 Summer Olympics | New York City | London |\n| 2016 Summer Olympics | Chicago | Rio de Janeiro |\n\n\n## Medal tables[edit]\n\n\nSee also: All-time Olympic Games medal table\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Updated on December 31, 2021*\n\\**This table includes two medals \u2013 one silver awarded in the ice hockey and one bronze awarded in the figure skating events at the 1920 Summer Olympics.*\nThe United States has never won an Olympic medal in the following current winter sport: biathlon.\n \n |\n\nBest results in non-medaling sports:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe United States has had eight Olympic medals stripped, which is fifth in the ranking of countries with the most stripped medals.[71]\n\n\n\n* 1972 Summer Olympics, Rick DeMont, first place, gold medalist, Swimming, Men's 400 m freestyle[72]\n* 2000 Summer Olympics, Marion Jones, first place, gold medalist, Athletics, Women's 100 m[73]\n* 2000 Summer Olympics, Marion Jones, first place, gold medalist, Athletics, Women's 200 m[73]\n* 2000 Summer Olympics, Marion Jones, third place, bronze medalist, Athletics, Women's long jump[73]\n* 2000 Summer Olympics, Relay team (Antonio Pettigrew, Jerome Young), first place, gold medalists, Athletics, Men's 4 \u00d7 400 m relay[74]\n* 2000 Summer Olympics, Lance Armstrong, third place, bronze medalist, Cycling, Men's road time trial[75]\n* 2004 Summer Olympics, Tyler Hamilton, first place, gold medalist, Cycling, Men's road time trial[76]\n* 2012 Summer Olympics, Relay team (Tyson Gay), second place, silver medalist, Athletics, Men's 4 \u00d7 100 m relay[77]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 1968 Mexico City | 357 | 45 | 28 | 34 | **107** | 1 | 1 |\n| 1972 Munich | 400 | 33 | 31 | 30 | **94** | 2 | 2 |\n| 1976 Montreal | 396 | 34 | 35 | 25 | **94** | 3 | 2 |\n| 1980 Moscow | *Did not participate* |\n| 1984 Los Angeles | 522 | 83 | 61 | 30 | **174** | 1 | 1 |\n| 1988 Seoul | 527 | 36 | 31 | 27 | **94** | 3 | 3 |\n| 1992 Barcelona | 545 | 37 | 34 | 37 | **108** | 2 | 2 |\n| 1996 Atlanta | 646 | 44 | 32 | 25 | **101** | 1 | 1 |\n| 2000 Sydney | 586 | 37 | 24 | 32 | **93** | 1 | 1 |\n| 2004 Athens | 533 | 36 | 39 | 26 | **101** | 1 | 1 |\n| 2008 Beijing | 588 | 36 | 39 | 37 | **112** | 2 | 1 |\n| 2012 London | 530 | 48 | 26 | 30 | **104** | 1 | 1 |\n| 2016 Rio de Janeiro | 555 | 46 | 37 | 38 | **121** | 1 | 1 |\n| 2020 Tokyo | 621 | 39 | 41 | 33 | **113** | 1 | 1 |\n| 2024 Paris | *Future event* |\n| 2028 Los Angeles | *Future event* |\n| 2032 Brisbane | *Future event* |\n| Total | 1061 | 830 | 738 | 2629 | 1 | 1 |\n\n | Medals by Winter Games[edit]\n\u00a0\u00a0Host country\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe United States of America has sent many athletes to the celebration of the Olympic Games, starting with the first modern Olympics held in 1896.

The United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC) is the National Olympic Committee for the United States.\n\n\nAmerican athletes have won a total of 2,629 medals (1,061 of them gold) at the Summer Olympic Games, and another 330 (113 of them gold) at the Winter Olympic Games. This makes the United States the most prolific medal-winning nation in the history of the Olympics.

In gymnastics, Japan continued to frustrate the Soviets, once again surpassing them in the medal standings. Last but not least, the US basketball team won its seventh consecutive gold medal, a feat not matched by any other Olympic team in ball sports. Very few would have assumed that this was the last time that the US finished first in the medal table in a fully attended Summer Olympics until 1996 (the Americans would top the medal standings in 1984 with the Soviet Union and its satellites boycotting).[24]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhen a US athlete wins an Olympic medal, as of 2016, the USOPC paid the winner $25,000 for gold, $15,000 for silver, and $10,000 for bronze.[50] The USOPC increased the payouts by 25% to $37,000 for gold, $22,500 for silver, and $15,000 for bronze beginning in 2017.[51] These numbers are significantly lower than in other countries, where Olympic gold medalists receive up to $1 million from their governments for a gold medal.[52][53] Since 2018, payouts to Paralympic athletes have been the same as to the Olympians.

American athletes won 31 medals in track and field, their most successful sport. US basketball team won its third consecutive gold, twice defeating the Soviets in the process, American boxers won all five finals they entered, and American weightlifters edged their Soviet rivals 4 to 3 in terms of gold medals, with the two nations sweeping all seven events in the sport.[19][20]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Summer\n |\n| --- |\n| Sport\n | Rank\n | Athlete\n | Event & Year\n |\n| ![](image) Badminton | 8th | Howard Bach &Bob Malaythong | Men's doubles in 2008 |\n| ![](image) Handball | 5th | United States women's team | Women's tournament in 1984 |\n| ![](image) Rhythmic gymnastics | 9th | Mandy JamesAlaine Mata-BaquerotKate NelsonBrandi SiegelChallen SieversBecky Turner | Women's group in 1996 |\n| ![](image) Table tennis | 6th | Gao JunCrystal HuangWang Chen | Women's team in 2008 |\n| ![](image) Trampoline gymnastics | 6th | Savannah Vinsant | Women's individual in 2012 |\n| Nicole Ahsinger | Women's individual in 2020 |\n| Winter\n |\n| Sport\n | Rank\n | Athlete\n | Event & Year\n |\n| ![](image) Biathlon | 6th | Lowell BaileyTim BurkeSean DohertyLeif Nordgren | Men's relay in 2018 |\n\n## Flagbearers[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of flag bearers for the United States at the Olympics\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![](image) Winter Olympics medal table leaders by year\n |\n| --- |\n| * 1924: ![](image)\u00a0Norway\n* 1928: ![](image)\u00a0Norway\n* 1932: ![](image)\u00a0United States\n* 1936: ![](image)\u00a0Norway\n* 1948: ![](image)\u00a0Norway/![](image)\u00a0Sweden\n* 1952: ![](image)\u00a0Norway\n* 1956: ![](image)\u00a0Soviet Union\n* 1960: ![](image)\u00a0Soviet Union\n* 1964: ![](image)\u00a0Soviet Union\n* 1968: ![](image)\u00a0Norway\n* 1972: ![](image)\u00a0Soviet Union\n* 1976: ![](image)\u00a0Soviet Union\n* 1980: ![](image)\u00a0Soviet Union\n* 1984: ![](image)\u00a0East Germany\n* 1988: ![](image)\u00a0Soviet Union\n* 1992: ![](image)\u00a0Germany\n* 1994: ![](image)\u00a0Russia\n* 1998: ![](image)\u00a0Germany\n* 2002: ![](image)\u00a0Norway\n* 2006: ![](image)\u00a0Germany\n* 2010: ![](image)\u00a0Canada\n* 2014: ![](image)\u00a0Russia\n* 2018: ![](image)\u00a0Norway\n* 2022: ![](image)\u00a0Norway\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThere was some redemption for the US at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, as the nation returned to the top of the gold medal count for the first time since 1952. Particularly successful was the US swimming team that won 13 out of available 18 golds and shattered 9 world records. In track and field, the Americans also improved on their 1960 performance, winning 14 gold and 24 total medals, while the Soviets left Japan with 5 gold and 18 total medals, a significant downturn compared to their 1960 results. The Soviets, however, continued to dominate Olympic weightlifting, and, with the American program falling apart, the USSR produced four golds and three silvers. The Soviet Union hoped to replicate that success in gymnastics and wrestling, the sports that, together with weightlifting, were strongly associated with their athletic prowess. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n10 Soviet golds in gymnastics didn't surprise anyone, as the nation had always been a gymnastics powerhouse, but it did mean that the Soviets beat the Americans in the medal standings for the second straight summer games. The US basketball team, however, met the pre-tournament expectations and won its fifth consecutive gold medal, a noble feat, given that they had to compete against veteran pros from the USSR. The final result, 43 gold and 103 total medals for the Soviets to 34 gold and 71 total medals for the Americans, showed that America was no longer a leading force in Olympic competition.[22]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe achievement was even more notable due to the fact that the American boxers were significantly younger and less experienced than their Cuban and Soviet counterparts.[29] In other sports, US divers won five medals, including two golds; the US equestrian team took home four medals; American shooters won three medals, including a historic silver by a woman in the mixed 50 meters rifle three positions; US freestyle wrestlers advanced to four gold medal bouts, yet won only one of them (all four were against the Soviets), concluding the meet with six medals overall. The US men's basketball team reclaimed the gold medal, while the women's team won a surprising silver, being ranked no higher than sixth prior to the start of the tournament. The Soviets and East Germans were unstoppable in canoeing, gymnastics, rowing, weightlifting and wrestling, going 1\u20132 in the overall medal standings (49 gold and 125 total medals for the Soviets, and 40 gold and 90 total medals for East Germans). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![Russia](image) Russia\n |\n| --- |\n| Games\n | Gold\n | Silver\n | Bronze\n | Total\n | Rank |\n| 1952 Helsinki | 22 | 30 | 19 | 71 | 2 |\n| 1956 Melbourne | 37 | 29 | 32 | 98 | 1 |\n| 1960 Rome | 43 | 29 | 31 | 103 | 1 |\n| 1964 Tokyo | 30 | 31 | 35 | 96 | 2 |\n| 1968 Mexico City | 29 | 32 | 30 | 91 | 2 |\n| 1972 Munich | 50 | 27 | 22 | 99 | 1 |\n| 1976 Montreal | 49 | 41 | 35 | 125 | 1 |\n| 1980 Moscow | 80 | 69 | 46 | 195 | 1 |\n| 1984 Los Angeles | *Did not participate* |\n| 1988 Seoul | 55 | 31 | 46 | 132 | 1 |\n| 1992 Barcelona | 45 | 38 | 29 | 112 | 1 |\n| 1996 Atlanta | 26 | 21 | 16 | 63 | 2 |\n| 2000 Sydney | 32 | 28 | 29 | 89 | 2 |\n| 2004 Athens | 28 | 26 | 36 | 90 | 3 |\n| 2008 Beijing | 24 | 13 | 23 | 60 | 3 |\n| 2012 London | 20 | 20 | 29 | 68 | 4 |\n| 2016 Rio de Janeiro | 19 | 17 | 20 | 56 | 4 |\n| 2020 Tokyo | 20 | 28 | 23 | 71 | 5 |\n| 2024 Paris | *Future event* |\n| 2028 Los Angeles |\n| 2032 Brisbane |\n| Total | 609 | 510 | 501 | 1619 | 2 |\n\n | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![Russia](image) Russia\n |\n| --- |\n| Games\n | Gold\n | Silver\n | Bronze\n | Total\n | Rank |\n| 1956 Cortina d'Ampezzo | 7 | 3 | 6 | 16 | 1 |\n| 1960 Squaw Valley | 7 | 5 | 9 | 21 | 1 |\n| 1964 Innsbruck | 11 | 8 | 6 | 25 | 1 |\n| 1968 Grenoble | 5 | 5 | 3 | 13 | 2 |\n| 1972 Sapporo | 8 | 5 | 3 | 16 | 1 |\n| 1976 Innsbruck | 13 | 6 | 8 | 27 | 1 |\n| 1980 Lake Placid | 10 | 6 | 6 | 22 | 1 |\n| 1984 Sarajevo | 6 | 10 | 9 | 25 | 2 |\n| 1988 Calgary | 11 | 9 | 9 | 29 | 1 |\n| 1992 Albertville | 9 | 6 | 8 | 23 | 2 |\n| 1994 Lillehammer | 11 | 8 | 4 | 23 | 1 |\n| 1998 Nagano | 9 | 6 | 3 | 18 | 3 |\n| 2002 Salt Lake City | 5 | 4 | 4 | 13 | 5 |\n| 2006 Turin | 8 | 6 | 8 | 22 | 4 |\n| 2010 Vancouver | 3 | 5 | 7 | 15 | 11 |\n| 2014 Sochi | 11 | 9 | 9 | 29 | 1 |\n| 2018 Pyeongchang | 2 | 6 | 9 | 17 | 13 |\n| 2022 Beijing | 6 | 12 | 14 | 32 | 9 |\n| 2026 Milan\u2013Cortina | *future event* |\n| Total | 142 | 119 | 125 | 376 | 3 |\n\n | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Eastern Bloc dominated the 1976 Montreal Olympics, with seven countries placing in the top ten of the medal table. The United States team was relegated to a third place in the medal standings for the first time in its history. This was an Olympics of contrasts: the US men's swimming team, despite the generally dismal showing of the overall delegation, swept 12 gold and 27 total medals in the 13 events that were on the program and broke 11 world records in the process (arguably the most dominant performance of any swimming team in history),[27] while the US women's swimming team, on the other hand, fell victim to what was later shown to be a pervasive East German doping program.[28] They still managed to win a gold medal, in an upset of the East Germans in the 4x100 freestyle relay. The event was held on the last day of the swimming program, and the American women were risking being deprived of gold for the first time in US Olympic history. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe rapid rise of the Soviet Union to challenge the United States as a leading Olympic power raised questions and suspicion about the means used to achieve this, including the pretense of professional athletes having amateur status and allegations of state-sponsored doping. After 20 years of competition on the Olympic stage, the USSR convincingly topped the medal chart at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich. After that, the U.S. would not top the medal table in non-boycotted games until the 1996 Summer Olympics, five years after the USSR collapsed.[9][10] A bright spot for the United States was the 1984 games in Los Angeles, where the U.S. set a record for most gold medals won in a single Olympics (83), buoyed by the Soviet-led boycott. Coincident with a drive by the International Olympic Committee toward gender parity beginning in the 1990s, the U.S.\u2019s fortunes improved, and the nation topped the medal table in the Summer Olympics six times since 1992 and placed second on two occasions.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSee also: United States at the Summer Olympics and United States at the Winter Olympics\n\n\n\n\n\nSporting event delegation\n\n\n| United States at theOlympics |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Flag of the United States\n |\n| IOC code | USA |\n| NOC | United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee |\n| Website | www.teamusa.org |\n| MedalsRanked 1st | \nGold\n1,174\nSilver\n952\nBronze\n833\nTotal\n2,959\n |\n| Summer appearances |\n| * 1896\n* 1900\n* 1904\n* 1908\n* 1912\n* 1920\n* 1924\n* 1928\n* 1932\n* 1936\n* 1948\n* 1952\n* 1956\n* 1960\n* 1964\n* 1968\n* 1972\n* 1976\n* 1980\n* 1984\n* 1988\n* 1992\n* 1996\n* 2000\n* 2004\n* 2008\n* 2012\n* 2016\n* 2020\n* 2024\n |\n| Winter appearances |\n| * 1924\n* 1928\n* 1932\n* 1936\n* 1948\n* 1952\n* 1956\n* 1960\n* 1964\n* 1968\n* 1972\n* 1976\n* 1980\n* 1984\n* 1988\n* 1992\n* 1994\n* 1998\n* 2002\n* 2006\n* 2010\n* 2014\n* 2018\n* 2022\n |\n| Other related appearances |\n| 1906 Intercalated Games |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHowever, they encountered a zealous resistance from the Japanese, who used their home-field advantage to stun the Soviets, beating them five to three in wrestling golds, and winning five gymnastics championships to their four. Thus, Japan had a major influence on the US\u2013USSR medals race, and most certainly helped the Americans edge their biggest rivals, while also managing to produce its best ever medal output and finishing in third place. For the Americans, despite their dismal performance in boxing where they achieved only one gold, the 1964 Olympics were a definite success, with the nation winning 36 gold and 90 total medals compared to the Soviet tally of 30 gold and 96 total medals. Therefore, the US topped the gold medal count, finishing second in the total medal count, while the USSR topped the total medal count, finishing second in the gold medal count.

American women dominated swimming for the last time until 1992, as by 1976 they would be overtaken by East German dopers.[25]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Czech Republic\n* Denmark\n* Estonia\n* Finland\n* France\n* Georgia\n* Germany\n\t+ Summer\n\t+ Winter\n* Great Britain\n* Greece\n* Hungary\n* Iceland\n* Ireland\n* Israel\n* Italy\n* Kosovo\n* Latvia\n* Liechtenstein\n* Lithuania\n* Luxembourg\n* Malta\n* Moldova\n* Monaco\n* Montenegro\n* Netherlands\n* North Macedonia\n* Norway\n* Poland\n* Portugal\n* Romania\n* Russia\n* San Marino\n* Serbia\n* Slovakia\n* Slovenia\n* Spain\n* Sweden\n* Switzerland\n* Turkey\n* Ukraine\n |\n| Oceania | * American Samoa\n* Australia\n\t+ Winter\n* Cook Islands\n* Fiji\n* Guam\n* Kiribati\n* Marshall Islands\n* Micronesia\n* Nauru\n* New Zealand\n* Palau\n* Papua New Guinea\n* Samoa\n* Solomon Islands\n* Tonga\n* Tuvalu\n* Vanuatu\n |\n| Other | * Independent Olympians\n* Refugee Olympic Team\n |\n| Historical | * Australasia\n* Bohemia\n* British West Indies\n* Republic of China\n* Czechoslovakia\n* Germany\n\t+ East\n\t+ West\n\t+ United\n* Mixed teams\n* Netherlands Antilles\n* North Borneo\n* Rhodesia\n* Russia\n\t+ Russian Empire\n\t+ Soviet Union\n\t+ Unified Team\n\t+ Olympic Athletes from Russia\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn weightlifting, the Americans and Soviets once again won all seven events, once again with a 4 to 3 ratio in favor of the US team. In boxing, the Soviets won 3 golds, while the Americans only managed to win two events. However, it was gymnastics where the USSR achieved its greatest success, winning 11 out of 17 events and guaranteeing the first place in the medal rankings. The US basketball team won its fourth consecutive gold, beating the Soviets in the final game, 89\u201355.[21]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe 1960 Rome Olympics saw the Americans losing their grip on their traditionally successful sports, such as track and field and weightlifting. On the other hand, boxing, swimming (where the Americans won 9 gold medals, while being controversially denied gold in the 100 meters freestyle, despite showing the best time), and wrestling produced unexpectedly good results, which somewhat helped to compensate for what was lost in other sports. In track and field, the Soviets won 11 golds, only one less than the Americans. It is worth mentioning that the US team encountered many problems throughout the meet, such as a controversial disqualification of their gold medal-winning men's 4x100 relay team. In weightlifting, the Soviets, with the help of their state-of-the-art doping program, won five out of seven events, leaving the US with only one gold. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe 1948 London Olympics marked the first time that newly communist countries, occupied by the Soviet Union after WW2, competed in the games. The Soviets themselves declined to compete, sending only observers, after a long hesitation that saw Soviet leader Joseph Stalin demanding guarantees from his sports officials that the USSR would beat the US in the medal standings. The Soviet officials told him that chances were 50/50, and Stalin ultimately rejected the idea of competing in 1948. With its newest political rival absent, the United States comfortably dominated the games, winning 38 gold and 84 total medals, 22 gold and 40 total medals more than the runner-up Sweden. The most medals were won in track and field, 27, and swimming, 15. The US basketball team won its second consecutive gold medal, defeating France in the final, 65\u201321.[15]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. ^ ***a*** ***b*** J. N.

The countries developed a strong rivalry during the Cold War. While the tensions eased in the 1990s, the relations deteriorated in 2014 and 2016.[79]\n\n\nSince the 1952 Summer Olympics, the United States has won 1,986 Summer and Winter Olympics medals, the most in that period, while Russia has won 1,973 medals, the second most in that period.\n\n\n\n### Summer Olympics[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** [1] [*bare URL*]\n2. **^** Skousen, Mark (August 17, 2016). \"Privately Funded USA Olympic Team...Wins!\". *Townhall*.\n3. **^** Crookston, Paul (August 10, 2016). \"U.S. Has Done Fine with No Government Department of Sports\". *National Review*.\n4. **^** Hart, Torrey (August 7, 2020). \"U.S. Olympic Athletes in Financial Limbo Without Olympics, Events\".\n5. **^** Bachman, Rachel (April 12, 2020). \"WSJ News Exclusive | U.S. Olympic Sports Groups Seek Government Aid\". *Wall Street Journal* \u2013 via www.wsj.com.\n6. **^** Carter Vaughn Findley; John Alexander Rothney (January 1, 2011). *Twentieth-Century World*.

However, the policies of Perestroika that were initiated by Gorbachev in 1985 led to the Soviet participation in the games. Cuba, clearly not understanding such a betrayal, decided to boycott the Olympics on its own, impacting the boxing field as a result. The Soviet Union was steadily moving towards its ultimate collapse but its sporting empire was still in its prime. The Soviets and their close allies from East Germany utterly dominated the games, winning 55 and 37 gold medals respectively (132 and 102 total medals).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThis was the first US loss in Olympic basketball history and it ended the Americans' 63-game winning streak in Olympic basketball. In general, the US team greatly underperformed at these games, winning only 6 gold medals in track and field to the East Germans' 8 and Soviets' 9, though the Americans still won the most total medals, 22. In boxing, the Cubans and Soviets dominated, winning three and two championships, respectively, while the US won only one gold and four medals overall (compared to the Soviets' two and Cubans' five). In diving, the Americans won three medals; in soccer, the USSR and GDR fixed a bronze medal game, playing a tie, so both teams received bronze; in gymnastics, the Soviets edged their old rivals Japan to top the medal count; in weightlifting, the Soviets and Bulgarians won three golds each; in wrestling, the US team surprised with three golds in freestyle, yet the Soviets still dwarfed their medal tally with nine golds in freestyle and Greco-Roman (14\u20136 in total medals). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1972, the Soviets won 50 gold and 99 total medals to the Americans' 33 and 94; in 1976, the USSR amassed 49 gold and 125 total medals to the Americans' 34 and 94; 1980 Olympics were boycotted by the US and its allies, the Soviets retaliated in 1984 by boycotting the LA Olympics together with their satellites; finally, in 1988, the USSR won 55 gold and 132 total medals to the Americans' 36 and 94 (the US finished third at those games, losing even to the East Germans). In 1992, the Soviets still fielded a team despite the dissolution of their state, yet the margin of their victory over the Americans became narrower: 45 gold and 112 total medals to the Americans' 37 and 108. By 1996, every former Soviet republic formed its own National Olympic Committee, and the countries participated as independent nations, with Russia assuming the Soviet place in the IOC and inheriting Soviet achievements as by far the largest of the former Soviet republics. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Several members of America's first Olympic team in 1896.

Abbott was the first American woman to win an Olympic event.\nThe first modern Olympic Games, held in Athens, Greece, saw the Americans fielding 14 athletes that competed in three sports. The hosts, on the other hand, had 169 athletes competing and won 46 medals. The American team managed to win only 20 medals, dwarfed by the enormous Greek team. However, the United States managed to win 11 gold medals, edging out Greece, who secured 10 golds, and allowing Team USA to finish first in the gold medal tally. James Connolly became the first modern Olympic champion by winning the triple jump, and Thomas Burke won three gold medals in various track events, assuming the title of the most successful athlete of the 1896 Games.[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Munich Olympics saw the Soviet Union begin its streak of topping the medal count at five consecutive summer games in which they participated (1972\u20131992, though in 1992 they would compete as the *Unified Team* as the USSR dissolved half a year prior to the games, and the newly independent countries decided to compete together). The sporting nature of the event was largely overshadowed by the Munich massacre in the second week, in which eleven Israeli athletes and coaches and a West German police officer at Olympic village were killed by Black September terrorists. There were multiple calls to cancel the games after the terrorist attack, but the IOC declined. From a sporting standpoint, these games were one of the most controversial in history, with many accusing the organizing committee of anti-Americanism and trying to appease the Soviet Union and East Germany. Indeed, these were one of the strangest Olympics ever for American athletes. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n21. **^** \"United States at the 1956 Melbourne Summer Games | Olympics at Sports-Reference.com\".

The most notable of all American participants was Margaret Abbott, who became the first female American Olympic champion by winning the women's golf. The vast majority of American medals were won in the sport of athletics, where US athletes clinched 16 golds and 39 medals overall. Team USA won only 8 medals outside of athletics, four of them in golf. Overall, France dominated the medal standings, winning 29 gold and 112 total medals. The United States ranked second with 19 and 48, respectively, showing great efficiency, despite having significantly fewer athletes.[14]\n\n\nThe 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri, were the first ever Olympic Games held outside of Europe.\n\n\n\n### Interwar period (1920\u20131936)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nathlete with multiple gold medals, winning the women's snowboard cross event, and sharing the gold with teammate Nick Baumgartner in the mixed snowboard cross event.\n\n\n\n## Amateurism and professionalism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)U.S. President George W.

The 1912 Olympic pentathlon and decathlon champion Jim Thorpe was stripped of his medals, when it was discovered that he had played semi-professional baseball before the Olympics. His medals were posthumously restored by the IOC in 1983 on compassionate grounds.[43]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn contrast to its summer Olympics status, the United States was not a power in the Winter Games until the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City. Hosting the games in 2002 boosted the U.S. winter sports program; since then, the country\u2019s athletes have performed consistently well, never placing below fourth in the medal count. The nation won the most medals (37) at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver but dropped to 23 medals at the most recent 2018 games in Pyeongchang.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nU.S. athletes have appeared in every Summer Olympics in recent decades. The United States, represented by the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC), competed at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Originally scheduled to take place in the summer of 2020, the Games were postponed to July 23 to August 8, 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[39] The opening ceremony flag-bearers for the United States were baseball player Eddy Alvarez and basketball player Sue Bird.[40] Javelin thrower Kara Winger was the flag-bearer for the closing ceremony.[41] When USA Gymnastics announced that 2016 Olympic all-around champion Biles would not participate in the gymnastics all-around final, the spotlight fell on her American team-mates. The U.S. had won the event in each of the last five Olympic Games: a formidable winning streak was on the line. Sunisa Lee embraced the moment and stood tall to deliver for her country.

The US boxing team surprised everyone, advancing to six gold medal bouts and winning five of them, drawing parallels to a stellar 1952 team that also took five golds. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe U.S. and Russia played each other in a round-robin game at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. The game was tied 2\u20132 after overtime before the Americans prevailed in an eight-round shootout, with T.J. Oshie scoring on 4 of 6 attempts for the United States. The match has been dubbed by some as the \"Marathon on Ice\" due to its length.[92] Both teams, however, failed to medal; the Americans finished fourth (losing in the semis to Canada and to Finland in the bronze medal game), while the Russians placed fifth (losing to Finland in the quarterfinals).\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of United States Olympic medalists\n* United States at the Paralympics\n* United States at the Summer Olympics\n* United States at the Winter Olympics\n* United States at the Pan American Games\n* Four territories of the United States send independent Olympic teams (American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands)\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe United States made its Olympic debut in 1896 in Athens, the very first edition of the modern games. The nation performed inconsistently in the pre-World War-I period, primarily due to fielding considerably fewer athletes than host countries, with the exception being the 1904 Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri, where the U.S. achieved its largest medal haul in history, a record that still stands today. During the interwar period, the U.S. enjoyed its greatest success, topping both gold and total medal counts at four straight Summer Games, before falling short in the 1936 Berlin games. The next summer Olympics were held in 1948 following World War II. In 1952, the Soviet Union made its Olympic debut, initiating a state-sponsored approach to international sport focused on projecting socio-political superiority. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Medals by Summer Games[edit]\n\u00a0\u00a0Host country\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ B U15\n\t+ W\n\t+ W U23\n\t+ W U20\n\t+ W U19\n\t+ W U18\n\t+ W U17\n\t+ G U15\n\t+ M Beach soccer\n\t+ W Beach soccer\n\t+ M Para\n\t+ M Futsal\n\t+ W Deaf\n* Softball\n\t+ M\n\t+ M U19\n\t+ W\n\t+ W U18\n* Speedway\n* Squash\n\t+ M\n\t+ W\n* Swimming\n* Tennis\n\t+ M\n\t+ W\n\t+ X\n* Track and field\n* Volleyball\n\t+ M\n\t+ M U23\n\t+ M U21\n\t+ M U19\n\t+ W\n\t+ W U23\n\t+ W U20\n\t+ W U18\n\t+ Beach\n* Water polo\n\t+ M\n\t+ W\n* Wheelchair rugby\n |\n| * Olympics\n\t+ Summer\n\t+ Winter\n* Paralympics\n* Deaflympics\n* Pan American Games\n* Parapan American Games\n* World University Games\n* Youth Olympics\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nSports in the United States\n |\n| --- |\n| By state / territory | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 1992 Albertville | 147 | 5 | 4 | 2 | **11** | 5 | 6 |\n| 1994 Lillehammer | 147 | 6 | 5 | 2 | **13** | 5 | 5 |\n| 1998 Nagano | 186 | 6 | 3 | 4 | **13** | 5 | 6 |\n| 2002 Salt Lake City | 202 | 10 | 13 | 11 | **34** | 3 | 2 |\n| 2006 Turin | 204 | 9 | 9 | 7 | **25** | 2 | 2 |\n| 2010 Vancouver | 212 | 9 | 15 | 13 | **37** | 3 | 1 |\n| 2014 Sochi | 222 | 9 | 9 | 10 | **28** | 4 | 2 |\n| 2018 Pyeongchang | 228 | 9 | 8 | 6 | **23** | 4 | 4 |\n| 2022 Beijing | 220 | 8 | 10 | 7 | **25** | 4 | 5 |\n| 2026 Milan\u2013Cortina | *Future event* |\n| Total | 113 | 122 | 95 | 330 | 2 | 2 |\n\n\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n88. **^** \"Federation Rule Change Opens Olympics to N.B.A. Players\". *The New York Times*.

At six of its nine appearances at the Summer Olympic Games, the Soviet team ranked first in the total number of gold medals won, second three times, and became the biggest contender to the United States' domination in the Summer Games. Similarly, the team was ranked first in the gold medal count seven times and second twice in its nine appearances at the Winter Olympic Games. The Soviet Union's success might be attributed to a heavy state investment in sports to fulfill its political objectives on an international stage.[1]\n\n\nFollowing the Russian Revolution of November 1917 and the Russian Civil War (1917\u20131922), the Soviet Union did not participate in international sporting events on ideological grounds;[2] however, after World War II (1939\u20131945), dominating the Olympic Games came to be seen by Soviet officials and leaders as a useful method of promoting communism.[3] *The Olympic Committee of the USSR* was formed on April 21, 1951, and the IOC recognised the new body in its 45th session (May 7, 1951). In the same year, when the Soviet representative Konstantin Andrianov became an IOC member, the USSR officially joined the Olympic Movement.\n\n\nThe 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki thus became first Olympic Games for Soviet athletes. On July 20, 1952 Nina Romashkova won the first Olympic gold medal in the history of Soviet sport, competing in the women's discus throw. Romashkova's result in this event (51.42 m) was the new Olympic record at that time.\n\n\nThe 1956 Winter Olympics in Cortina d'Ampezzo became the first Winter Olympic Games for Soviet athletes. There Lyubov Kozyreva won the first Winter Olympic gold medal in the history of Soviet sport, competing in the women's cross-country skiing 10\u00a0km event.\n\n\nThe USSR became the host nation for the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. The United States and many other countries boycotted these Games in protest of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan; the USSR led a boycott of the 1984 Games in Los Angeles.\n\n\nAlthough the USSR ceased to exist on December 26, 1991, *The Olympic Committee of the USSR* formally existed until March 12, 1992, when it disbanded.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 1992, 7 of the 15 former Soviet Republics competed together as the Unified Team and marched under the Olympic Flag in the Albertville Games, where they finished second in the medal rankings. The Unified Team also competed in the Barcelona Games later in the year (represented by 12 of the 15 ex-Republics), and finished first in the medal rankings at those Games.\n\n\n\n\n## Hosted

All Soviet athletes held some nominal jobs, but were in fact state-sponsored and trained full-time. According to many experts, that gave the Soviet Union a huge advantage over the United States and other Western countries, whose athletes were students or real amateurs.[4][5] Indeed, the Soviet Union monopolized the top place in the medal standings after 1968, and, until its collapse, placed second only once, in the 1984 Winter games, after another Eastern bloc nation, the GDR. Amateur rules were relaxed only in the late 1980s and were almost completely abolished in the 1990s, after the fall of the USSR.[6][7]\n\n\n\n### Doping[edit]\n\n\nAccording to British journalist Andrew Jennings, a KGB colonel stated that the agency's officers had posed as anti-doping authorities from the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to undermine doping tests and that Soviet athletes were \"rescued with [these] tremendous efforts\".[8][9] On the topic of the 1980 Summer Olympics, a 1989 Australian study said \"There is hardly a medal winner at the Moscow Games, certainly not a gold medal winner, who is not on one sort of drug or another: usually several kinds. The Moscow Games might as well have been called the Chemists' Games.\"[8]\n\n\nDocuments obtained in 2016 revealed the Soviet Union's plans for a statewide doping system in track and field in preparation for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Dated prior to the country's decision to boycott the Games, the document detailed the existing steroids operations of the program, along with suggestions for further enhancements.[10] The communication, directed to the Soviet Union's head of track and field, was prepared by Dr. Sergei Portugalov of the Institute for Physical Culture. Portugalov was also one of the main figures involved in the implementation of the Russian doping program prior to the 2016 Summer Olympics.[10]\n\n\n\n### Flag bearers controversy[edit]\n\n\nSoviet officials expected the flag bearer to show an example of an attractive, physically strong person and a distinguished athlete. He was expected to carry the flag through the Olympic ceremony in one hand unsupported by a harness. This presented a formidable physical task as the flag weighed 16 kilograms (35\u00a0lb) in the 1960s, and a sudden wind might further increase the physical load. Hence the Soviet flag bearers at the opening ceremony of the Summer Olympics were selected from among heavyweight weightlifters or wrestlers, who did not have to compete the next day.[11]\n\n\nSoviet officials also expected the flag bearer to win a gold medal at the given Olympics. This resulted in absurd situations at the 1952 and 1956 Summer Olympics, when the selected flag bearers, Yakov Kutsenko and Aleksey Medvedev respectively, were not allowed to compete because the officials did not believe they would win a gold medal. Both were top-level heavyweight weightlifters. Kutsenko placed second at the 1950 World Championships and Medvedev won the world title in 1956 and 1957.[11]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of flag bearers for the Soviet Union at the Olympics\n* Category:Olympic competitors for the Soviet Union\n* Soviet Union at the Paralympics\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"The Role of Sports in the Soviet Union | Guided History\".\n2. **^** Keys, Barbara J.

been included and has won at least one medal in each of the five contests of Women's skeleton since its introduction with five different athletes. Lizzy Yarnold is the most successful Skeleton rider of all time winning back to back gold medals in 2014 and 2018. No other rider has successfully defended a gold medal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![Brazil](image) 2016 Rio de Janeiro | 366 | 27 | 23 | 17 | 67 | 2 |\n| ![Japan](image) 2020 Tokyo | 376 | 22 | 20 | 22 | 64 | 4 |\n| ![France](image) 2024 Paris | *future event* |\n| ![United States](image) 2028 Los Angeles |\n| ![Australia](image) 2032 Brisbane |\n| Total | 284 | 318 | 314 | 916 | 3 |\n\n | Medals by Winter Games[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe most successful British Olympian by gold medals won is Sir Jason Kenny, who has won seven gold medals in track cycling. He is followed by Sir Chris Hoy who won six. Kenny also has the most total medals with 9, followed by fellow cyclist Sir Bradley Wiggins who has eight. Dame Laura Kenny, with five gold medals, has the most golds of any British female athlete and became the first British woman to win gold at three consecutive Olympic Games at Tokyo 2020. She shares the designation of most total medals by a British female competitor with horse-rider Charlotte Dujardin. Sir Steve Redgrave is the only British Olympian to win a gold medal in five consecutive Olympic Games, winning his first in 1984 Los Angeles and last in 2000 Sydney.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Event | No. ofappearances | Firstappearance | Firstmedal | Firstgold medal | Gold | Silver | Bronze\n | Total\n | Best finish\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Men's rugby union | 2/4 | 1900 | 1900 | \u2014 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 2 | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) (1900, 1908)\n |\n| Men's rugby sevens | 2/2 | 2016 | 2016 | \u2014 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) (2016)\n |\n| Women's rugby sevens | 2/2 | 2016 | \u2014 | \u2014 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 4th (2016, 2020)\n |\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n### Sailing[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Sailing at the Summer Olympics\n\nGreat Britain took four gold medals in the first Olympic sailing events in 1900.

Germany has hosted three Olympic Games, in 1936 both the Winter and Summer Games, and the 1972 Summer Olympics. In addition, Germany had been selected to host the 1916 Summer Olympics as well as the 1940 Winter Olympics, both of which had to be cancelled due to World Wars. After these wars, Germany was banned from participating in the 1920, 1924 and 1948 Olympics.\n\n\nWhile the country was divided, each of the two German states boycotted one of the Summer Games. In 1980, West Germany was one of 66 nations which did not go to Moscow in protest at the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan, and in 1984 East Germany joined the Soviet Union and several others in the boycott of the Summer Games in Los Angeles. In 1990, East Germany and West Germany would reunite, with Germany once again competing as a single full sovereign state since the 1992 Olympic year.\n\n\nThe IOC currently splits German results among four codes, even though only the German Democratic Republic (GDR) from 1968 to 1988 had sent a separate team to compete against the team of the German NOC that represented Germany (GER) since 1896.\n\n\n\n\n## German post-WW2 division until 1990[edit]\n\n\nAfter German organisations had been dissolved by the Allies in 1947, in 1950 the IOC recognized the reorganized Nationales Olympisches Komitee f\u00fcr Deutschland for all of Germany, based in (West) Germany.\n\n\nDue to the Cold War, an East German state (German Democratic Republic) was created in October 1949, and a separate National Olympic Committee (NOC) for East Germany was established in 1951. It was not immediately recognized by the IOC, which until 1965 required that athletes of the NOC of East Germany join the German team represented by the West Germany-based NOC of Germany. This team, which competed together from 1956 to 1964, is nowadays called the United Team of Germany (*EUA*, \"Equipe Unifi\u00e9e Allemande\"), but was Germany (*GER*) then. As a result of the Germany being divided, from 1968 to 1990 two independent teams competed in each of the Games; the original designations were *GER* for the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) and *GDR* for the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). In 1980 the West German code was changed to *FRG* (which is currently also applied by the IOC in retrospect). After the GDR ceased to exist in 1990 and its states joined the Federal Republic of Germany, Germany once again was represented by a single team, designated *GER*.\n\n\nAdditionally, in the early 1950s the French-occupied Saar had its own NOC and competed at the 1952 Summer Olympics before joining the German Olympic team in 1956 and the (West) German state by 1957.\n\n\n\n## Overview of

German NOCs[edit]\n\n\nGermany has competed at the Olympics under five different designations, including as two separate teams at several Games. Sources vary in how they present the medals won by these teams. The table below shows sourced combinations of these teams, when applied to the main table. Saar competed independently in the Summer Olympic games in 1952, but failed to win any medals. Due to most lists only listing medal counts, it's possible but not certain Saar was included as part of Germany in their calculations.\n\n\n\n![](image)Medals won by Germany at the Summer Olympic Games between 1896 and 2012 (between 1956 and 1964 as the United Team of Germany and between 1968 and 1988 as a sum of medals of West and East Germany)![](image)Medals won by Germany at the Winter Olympic Games between 1928 and 2014 (between 1956 and 1964 as the United Team of Germany and between 1968 and 1988 as sum of medals of West and East Germany)\n**Medal counts:**  \n\n*status after the 2022 Olympics, as of February 20, 2022*\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Summer Games\n | Winter Games\n | Combined total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Team (IOC\u00a0code) | \u2116\n | ![1st place, gold medalist(s)](image)\n | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image)\n | ![3rd place, bronze medalist(s)](image)\n | Total\n | \u2116\n | ![1st place, gold medalist(s)](image)\n | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image)\n | ![3rd place, bronze medalist(s)](image)\n | Total\n | \u2116\n | ![1st place, gold medalist(s)](image)\n | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image)\n | ![3rd place, bronze medalist(s)](image)\n | Total\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0![](image)\u00a0![](image)\u00a0Germany\u00a0(GER) | 17 | 201 | 207 | 247 | 655 | 13 | 104 | 98 | 65 | 267 | 30 | 305 | 305 | 312 | 922\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Saar\u00a0(SAA) | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0United Team of Germany\u00a0(EUA) | 3 | 28 | 54 | 36 | 118 | 3 | 8 | 6 | 5 | 19 | 6 | 36 | 60 | 41 | 137\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0East Germany\u00a0(GDR) | 5 | 153 | 129 | 127 | 409 | 6 | 39 | 36 | 35 | 110 | 11 | 192 | 165 | 162 | 519\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0West Germany\u00a0(FRG) | 5 | 56 | 67 | 81 | 204 | 6 | 11 | 15 | 13 | 39 | 11 | 67 | 82 | 94 | 243\n |\n| Total\n | 26 | 438 | 457 | 491 | 1386 | 22 | 162 | 155 | 118 | 435 | 48 | 600 | 612 | 609 | 1821\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Combined IOC codes\n | No. Games\n | ![1st place, gold medalist(s)](image) | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![3rd place, bronze medalist(s)](image) | Combined total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Germany\u00a0(GER)[1] | 30 | 305 | 305 | 312 | 922\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Germany\u00a0(GER) (EUA) | 36 | 341 | 365 | 353 | 1059\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Germany\u00a0(GER) (EUA) (FRG) | 47 | 408 | 447 | 447 | 1302\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Germany\u00a0(GER) (EUA) (FRG) (GDR)[2] | 58[3] | 600 | 612 | 609 | 1821\n |\n\n\n\n## Hosted Games[edit]\n\n\nFor the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, West Germany, see West Germany at the Olympics.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Games | Host city | Dates | Nations | Participants | Events\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1936 Winter Olympics | Garmisch-Partenkirchen | 6 \u2013 16 February | 28 | 646 | 17\n |\n| 1936 Summer Olympics | Berlin | 1 \u2013 6 August | 49 | 3,963 | 129\n |\n\n\n### Unsuccessful bids[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Games\n | City\n | Winner of bid[4] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1908 Summer Olympics | Berlin | London, United Kingdom\n |\n| 2000 Summer Olympics | Berlin | Sydney, Australia\n |\n| 2012 Summer Olympics | *Leipzig*[a] | London, United Kingdom\n |\n| 2018 Winter Olympics | Munich | Pyeongchang, South Korea\n |\n| 2024 Summer Olympics | Hamburg | Paris, France\n |\n\n\n1. **^** Not shortlisted into candidate stage\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of flag bearers for Germany at the Olympics\n* Category:Olympic competitors for Germany\n* Germany at the Paralympics\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** International Olympic Committee: Germany\n2. **^** BBC: Timeline: Olympic Powers\n3. **^** Counting the eleven Games where both East Germany (GDR) and West Germany (FRG) competed as two appearances.\n4. **^** \"Past Olympic host city election results\".

France has competed in every edition (both Summer and Winter), with the possible exception of the 1904 Games (as sources disagree about whether athlete Albert Corey competed for the United States or France[1][2]).\n\n\nFrench athletes have won 751 medals at the Summer Olympic Games in a wide variety of sports, achieving particular success in fencing and cycling. France has won an additional 138 medals at the Winter Olympic Games, mostly in alpine skiing.\n\n\n\n\n## Hosted Games[edit]\n\n\n![France at the Olympics is located in

The nation was a frequent competitor from then through 1996, peaking with a gold medal win in 1984. France did not qualify for the men's tournament from 2000 to 2016, but has qualified for the 2020 Games.\n\n\nFrance did not qualify for the first four women's tournaments from 1996 to 2008. The French women debuted in 2012, placing 4th, and followed that with a 5th-place finish in 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Games\n | Players\n | Events | Gold | Silver | Bronze\n | Total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1900 Paris | 13 | 1/1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n |\n| Total |  |  | 1 | 1 | 0 | 2\n |\n\n\n### Golf[edit]\n\n\nFrance competed in the first Olympic golf tournaments in 1900, which the nation hosted.

The nation's first medals in the sport came when Paris hosted the Games in 1900; the only event on the schedule was the men's individual all-around, in which France swept the top 18 places (having 108 of the 135 competing gymnasts).\n\n\n\n\n\n| Games\n | Gymnasts\n | Events | Gold | Silver | Bronze\n | Total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1896 Athens | 1 | 1/8 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n |\n| 1900 Paris | 108 | 1/1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 3\n |\n| Total |  |  | 3 | 10 | 9 | 22\n |\n\n\n### Polo[edit]\n\n\nFrance competed at two of the five editions of Olympic polo tournaments, both occasions when Paris hosted the Games in 1900 and 1924. The nation is formally credited with no medals, though French players competed on a mixed team in 1900 (along with a British player) that took bronze. France had a fully-French team as well in 1900, which took fifth place. Both the all-French and the mixed team went 0\u20131 (losing to the same team), with the mixed team placed higher due to a bye. The French team in 1924 went 0\u20134 in the round-robin tournament. Thus, the overall Olympic record of teams with French polo players is 0\u20136.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Games\n | Players\n | Events | Gold | Silver | Bronze\n | Total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1900 Paris | 7 | 1/1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0[6] |\n| 1924 Paris | 5 | 1/1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n |\n| Total |  |  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0[6] |\n\n\n### Rowing[edit]\n\n\nFrance hosted the inaugural Olympic rowing contests in Paris 1900.

France did not play in 1908, but returned in 1920 (losing the single match to the United States) and 1924 (beating Romania but losing again to the United States).\n\n\nWith the return of rugby, in the form of rugby sevens, in 2016, France competed again. France had both men's and women's teams in 2016; both advanced out of pool play to the quarterfinals but were defeated there.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Games\n | Players\n | Events | Gold | Silver | Bronze\n | Total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1900 Paris | 17 | 1/1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1\n |\n| 1920 Antwerp | 15 | 1/1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n |\n| 1924 Paris | 30 | 1/1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n |\n| 2016 Rio de Janeiro | 25 | 2/2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n |\n| Total |  |  | 1 | 2 | 0 | 3\n |\n\n\n### Sailing[edit]\n\n\nFrance hosted the first Olympic sailing competitions in 1900, earning 24 total medals in the 13 events, including 5 golds.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Games\n | No. Sailors\n | Events | Gold | Silver | Bronze\n | Total\n | Ranking\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1900 | *451* | 130/13 | 5 | 9 | 10 | 24 | 1\n |\n| 1908 | 3 | 1/4 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 4\n |\n| 1912 | 3 | 1/4 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 3\n |\n| 1920 | 3 | 1/14 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 6\n |\n| 1924 | 9 | 3/3 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 5\n |\n| 1928 | 13 | 3/3 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 3\n |\n| 1932 | 3 | 2/4 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 3\n |\n| 1936 | 14 | 4/4 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  |\n| 1948 | 17 | 5/5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  |\n| 1952 | 9 | 4/5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  |\n| 1956 | 8 | 4/5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  |\n| 1960 | 11 | 5/5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  |\n| 1964 | 3 | 2/5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  |\n| 1968 | 9 | 4/5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  |\n| 1972 | 11 | 5/6 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 2\n |\n| 1976 | 10 | 5/6 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  |\n| 1980 | 0 | 0/6 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  |\n| 1984 | 11 | 6/7 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 8\n |\n| 1988 | 13 | 7/8 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 1\n |\n| 1992 | 17 | 10/10 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 2\n |\n| 1996 | 13 | 8/10 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  |\n| 2000 | 12 | 7/11 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  |\n| 2004 | 18 | 11/11 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 7\n |\n| 2008 | 18 | 11/11 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 9\n |\n| 2012 | 16 | 10/10 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 12\n |\n| 2016 | 15 | 10/10 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 3 | 6\n |\n| 2020 | 14 | 9/10 | 0 | 2 | 1 | 3 | 8\n |\n| Total |  |  | 15 | 14 | 20 | 49 | 4\n |\n\n\n### Shooting[edit]\n\n\nFrance competed in shooting at the inaugural 1896 Games, with one shooter in one event, winning no medals.
