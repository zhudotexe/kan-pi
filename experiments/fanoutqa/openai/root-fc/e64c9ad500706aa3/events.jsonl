You can help by adding missing items with reliable sources.\n\nThis page provides **lists of best-selling books and book series** to date and in any language. *\"Best-selling\"* refers to the estimated number of copies sold of each book, rather than the number of books printed or currently owned. Comics and textbooks are not included in this list. The books are listed according to the highest sales estimate as reported in reliable, independent sources.\n\n\nAccording to *Guinness World Records* as of 1995, the Bible is the best selling book of all time with an estimated 5 billion copies sold and distributed.[1] Sales estimates for other printed religious texts include at least 800 million copies for the Qur'an and 190 million copies for the Book of Mormon.[2] Also, a single publisher has produced more than 140 million copies of the Bhagavad Gita. The total number could be much higher.[3] Among non-religious texts, the *Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung*, also known as the *Little Red Book*, has produced a wide array of sales and distribution figures—with estimates ranging from 800 million[1] to over 6.5 billion printed volumes.[4] Some claim the distribution ran into the \"billions\"[5] and some cite \"over a billion\" official volumes between 1966 and 1969 alone as well as \"untold numbers of unofficial local reprints and unofficial translations\".[6][7] Exact print figures for these and other books may also be missing or unreliable since these kinds of books may be produced by many different and unrelated publishers, in some cases over many centuries. All books of a religious, ideological, philosophical or political nature have thus been excluded from the lists of best-selling books below for these reasons.\n\n\nMany books lack comprehensive sales figures as book selling and reselling figures prior to the introduction of point of sale equipment was based on the estimates of book sellers, publishers or the authors themselves. For example, *The Lord of the Rings* as one text was recorded to have sold only 967,466 copies in the UK by 2009, but at the same time the author's estate claimed global sales figures of in excess of 150 million.[8] As such accurate figures are only available from the 1990s and in western nations such as US, UK and Australia. Further, e-books have not been included as out of copyright texts are often available freely in this format. Examples of books with reported high sales include *The Count of Monte Cristo* by Alexandre Dumas,[9] *Don Quixote* by Miguel de Cervantes,[10] *Journey to the West* by Wu Cheng'en[11] and *The Lord of the Rings*[12] (which has been sold as both a three volume series, *The Fellowship of the Ring*, *The Two Towers*, and *The Return of the King*, and as a single combined volume) by J. R. R. Tolkien. Hence, in cases where there is too much uncertainty, they are excluded from the list.\n\n\nHaving sold more than 600 million copies worldwide*,[13] Harry Potter* by J. K. Rowling is the best-selling book series in history. The first novel in the series, *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*, has sold in excess of 120 million copies,[14] making it one of the best-selling books of all time. As of June 2017, the series has been translated into 85 languages,[15] placing *Harry Potter* among history's most translated literary works. The last four books in the series consecutively set records as the fastest-selling books of all time, and the final installment, *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*, sold roughly fifteen million copies worldwide within twenty-four hours of its release.[16][17] With twelve million books printed in the first US run, it also holds the record for the highest initial print run for any book in history.[18][19]\n\n\n\n\n## Key[edit]\n\n\n  Nonfiction\n\n\n\n## List of best-selling individual books[edit]\n\n\n### More than 100 million copies[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Book | Author(s) | Original language | First published | Approximate sales\n | Genre\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| *A Tale of Two Cities* | Charles Dickens | English | 1859 | >200 million[20][*circular reporting?*] | Historical fiction |\n| *The Little Prince* (*Le Petit Prince*) | Antoine de Saint-Exupéry | French | 1943 | 200 million[21][22] | Fantasy, Children's fiction |\n| *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* | J.

The novel tells the story of the French Doctor Manette, his 18-year-long imprisonment in the Bastille in Paris, and his release to live in London with his daughter Lucie whom he had never met. The story is set against the conditions that led up to the French Revolution and the Reign of Terror. \n\n\nAs Dickens's best-known work of historical fiction, *A Tale of Two Cities* is said to be one of the best-selling novels of all time.[2][3][4] In 2003, the novel was ranked 63rd on the BBC's The Big Read poll.[5] The novel has been adapted for film, television, radio, and the stage, and has continued to influence popular culture.\n\n\n\n\n## Synopsis[edit]\n\n\n### Book the First: Recalled to Life[edit]\n\n\n#### Opening lines[edit]\n\n\nDickens opens the novel with a sentence that has become famous:\n\n\n> It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way—in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.[6]\n> \n> \n\n\n#### Plot of the first book[edit]\n\n\nIn 1775, Jerry Cruncher flags down the nightly mail-coach en route from London to Dover. Cruncher is an employee of Tellson's Bank in London; he carries a message for Jarvis Lorry, one of the bank's managers. Lorry sends Jerry back with the cryptic response \"Recalled to Life\", referring to Alexandre Manette, a French physician who has been released from the Bastille after an 18-year imprisonment. On arrival in Dover, Lorry meets Dr Manette's daughter Lucie and her governess, Miss Pross. Believing her father to be dead, Lucie faints at the news that he is alive. Lorry takes her to France for a reunion.\n\n\nIn the Paris neighbourhood of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, Dr Manette has been given lodgings by his former servant Ernest Defarge and his wife Therese, the owners of a wine shop. Lorry and Lucie find him in a small garret where he spends much of his time distractedly and obsessively making shoes – a skill he learned in prison. Lorry and Lucie take him back to England.\n\n\n\n### Book the Second: The Golden Thread[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\"The Sea Still Rises\", an illustration for Book 2, Chapter 22 by \"Phiz\"\n#### Plot of the second book[edit]\n\n\nIn 1780, French émigré Charles Darnay is on trial in London for treason against the British Crown. The key witnesses against him are two British spies, John Barsad and Roger Cly. Barsad claims that he would recognise Darnay anywhere, but Darnay's lawyer points out that his colleague in court, Sydney Carton, bears a strong resemblance to the prisoner. With Barsad's testimony thus undermined, Darnay is acquitted.\n\n\nIn Paris, the hated and abusive Marquis St. Evrémonde orders his carriage driven recklessly fast through the crowded streets, hitting and killing a child. The Marquis throws a coin to the child's father, Gaspard, to compensate him for his loss; as the Marquis drives on, a coin is flung back into the carriage.\n\n\nArriving at his country château, the Marquis meets Darnay, who is his nephew and heir. Out of disgust with his aristocratic family, the nephew has shed his real surname (St. Evrémonde) and anglicised his mother's maiden name, D'Aulnais, to Darnay. He despises the Marquis' views that \"Repression is the only lasting philosophy. The dark deference of fear and slavery ... will keep the dogs obedient to the whip, as long as this roof [looking up to it] shuts out the sky.\"[7] That night, Gaspard creeps into the château and stabs and kills the Marquis in his sleep. He avoids capture for nearly a year, but is eventually hanged in the nearby village.\n\n\nIn London, Carton confesses his love to Lucie, but quickly recognises that she cannot love him in return. Carton nevertheless promises to \"embrace any sacrifice for you and for those dear to you\".[8] Darnay asks for Dr Manette's permission to wed Lucie, and he agrees. On the morning of the marriage, Darnay reveals his real name and lineage to Dr Manette, facts that Manette had asked him to withhold until that day. The unexpected revelation causes Dr Manette to revert to his obsessive shoemaking. He returns to sanity before their return from honeymoon, and the whole incident is kept secret from Lucie.\n\n\nAs the years pass, Lucie and Charles raise a family in England: a son (who dies in childhood) and a daughter, little Lucie. Lorry finds a second home with them. Carton, though he seldom visits, is accepted as a close friend and becomes a special favourite of little Lucie.\n\n\nIn Paris in July 1789, the Defarges help to lead the storming of the Bastille, a symbol of royal tyranny. Defarge enters Dr Manette's former cell, One Hundred and Five, North Tower, and searches it thoroughly. Throughout the countryside, local officials and other representatives of the aristocracy are slaughtered, and the St. Evrémonde château is burned to the ground.\n\n\nIn 1792, Lorry travels to France to save important documents stored at Tellson's Paris branch from the chaos of the French Revolution. Darnay receives a letter from Gabelle, one of his uncle's former servants who has been imprisoned by the revolutionaries, pleading for Darnay (now the Marquis St. Evrémonde) to help secure his release. Without telling his family or revealing his position as the new Marquis, Darnay also sets out for Paris.\n\n\n\n### Book the Third: The Track of a Storm[edit]\n\n\n#### Plot of the third book[edit]\n\n\nOn his way to Paris, Darnay is arrested as a returning emigrated aristocrat and jailed in La Force Prison. Hoping to be able to save him, Dr Manette, Lucie and her daughter, Jerry, and Miss Pross all move to Paris and take up lodgings near those of Lorry.\n\n\nFifteen months later Darnay is finally tried, and Dr Manette – viewed as a popular hero after his long imprisonment in the Bastille – testifies on his behalf. Darnay is acquitted and released, but is re-arrested later that day.\n\n\nWhile running errands with Jerry, Miss Pross is amazed to run into her long-lost brother Solomon. Now posing as a Frenchman, he is an employee of the revolutionary authorities and one of Darnay's gaolers. Carton also recognises him – as Barsad, one of the spies who tried to frame Darnay at his trial in 1780. Solomon is desperate to keep his true identity hidden, and by threatening to denounce him as an English spy Carton blackmails Solomon into helping with a plan.\n\n\nDarnay's retrial the following day is based on new denunciations by the Defarges, and on a manuscript that Defarge had found when searching Dr Manette's prison cell. Defarge reads the manuscript to the tribunal. In it, Dr Manette had recorded that his imprisonment was at the hands of the Evrémonde brothers (Darnay's father and uncle) after he had tried to report their crimes. Darnay's uncle had kidnapped and raped a peasant girl. Her brother, first hiding his remaining younger sister, had gone to confront the uncle, who ran him through with his sword. In spite of the best efforts of Dr Manette, both the elder sister and the brother died. Dr Manette's manuscript concludes by denouncing the Evrémondes, \"them and their descendants, to the last of their race.\"[9] The jury takes that as irrefutable proof of Darnay's guilt, and he is condemned to die by the guillotine the next afternoon.\n\n\nIn the Defarges' wine shop, Carton discovers that Madame Defarge was the surviving sister of the peasant family, and he overhears her planning to denounce both Lucie and her daughter. He visits Lorry and warns him that Lucie and her family must be ready to flee the next day. He extracts a promise that Lorry and the family will be waiting for him in the carriage at 2 pm, ready to leave the very instant he returns.\n\n\nShortly before the executions are due to begin, Carton puts his plan into effect and, with Barsad's reluctant assistance, obtains access to Darnay's prison cell. Carton intends to be executed in Darnay's place. He drugs Darnay and trades clothes with him, then has Barsad carry Darnay out to the carriage where Lorry and the family are expecting Carton. They flee to England with Darnay, who gradually regains consciousness during the journey.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Madame Defarge goes to Lucie's lodgings, hoping to apprehend her and her daughter. There she finds Miss Pross, who is waiting for Jerry so they can follow the family out of Paris. The two women struggle and Madame Defarge's pistol discharges, killing her outright and permanently deafening Miss Pross.\n\n\n\n![](image)The seamstress and Carton, an illustration for Book 3, Chapter 15 by John McLenan (1859)\nAs Carton waits to board the tumbril that will take him to his execution, he is approached by another prisoner, a seamstress. Carton comforts her, telling her that their ends will be quick and that the worries of their lives will not follow them into \"the better land where ... [they] will be mercifully sheltered.\" A final prophetic thought runs through his mind in which he visualises a better future for the family and their descendants.\n\n\n\n#### Closing lines[edit]\n\n\nDickens closes with Carton's final prophetic vision as he contemplates the guillotine:[10]\n\n\n\n\n> I see Barsad, and Cly, Defarge, The Vengeance [a lieutenant of Madame Defarge], the Juryman, the Judge, long ranks of the new oppressors who have risen on the destruction of the old, perishing by this retributive instrument, before it shall cease out of its present use. I see a beautiful city and a brilliant people rising from this abyss, and, in their struggles to be truly free, in their triumphs and defeats, through long years to come, I see the evil of this time and of the previous time of which this is the natural birth, gradually making expiation for itself and wearing out.\n> \n> \n> \n> I see the lives for which I lay down my life, peaceful, useful, prosperous and happy, in that England which I shall see no more. I see Her with a child upon her bosom, who bears my name. I see her father, aged and bent, but otherwise restored, and faithful to all men in his healing office, and at peace. I see the good old man [Lorry], so long their friend, in ten years' time enriching them with all he has, and passing tranquilly to his reward.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n> I see that I hold a sanctuary in their hearts, and in the hearts of their descendants, generations hence. I see her, an old woman, weeping for me on the anniversary of this day. I see her and her husband, their course done, lying side by side in their last earthly bed, and I know that each was not more honoured and held sacred in the other's soul than I was in the souls of both.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n> I see that child who lay upon her bosom and who bore my name, a man winning his way up in that path of life which once was mine. I see him winning it so well, that my name is made illustrious there by the light of his. I see the blots I threw upon it, faded away. I see him, fore-most of just judges and honoured men, bringing a boy of my name, with a forehead that I know and golden hair, to this place—then fair to look upon, with not a trace of this day's disfigurement—and I hear him tell the child my story, with a tender and a faltering voice.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n> It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.\n> \n> \n\n\n## Characters[edit]\n\n\nIn order of appearance:\n\n\n\n### Book the First (November 1775)[edit]\n\n\n**Chapter 2**\n\n\n\n![](image)Illustration from a serialised edition of the story, showing three tricoteuses knitting, with the Vengeance standing in the centre.\n* **Jerry Cruncher**: Porter and messenger for Tellson's Bank and secret \"Resurrection Man\" (body-snatcher); though rough and abusive towards his wife, he provides courageous service to the Manettes in Book the Third. His first name is short for Jeremiah; the latter name shares a meaning with the name of Jarvis Lorry.\n* **Jarvis Lorry**: A manager at Tellson's Bank: \"...a gentleman of 60 ... Very orderly and methodical he looked ... He had a good leg, and was a little vain of it...\" He is a dear friend of Dr Manette and serves as a sort of trustee and guardian of the Manette family. The bank places him in charge of the Paris branch during the Revolution, putting him in position to provide life-saving service to the Manettes in Book the Third. The end of the book reveals that he lives to be 88.\n\n\n**Chapter 4**\n\n\n\n* **Lucie Manette**: Daughter of Dr Manette; an ideal pre-Victorian lady, perfect in every way. About 17 when the novel begins, she is described as short and slight with a \"pretty figure, a quantity of golden hair, a pair of blue eyes...\" Although Sydney Carton is in love with her, he declares himself an unsuitable candidate for her hand in marriage and instead she marries Charles Darnay, with whom she is very much in love, and bears him a daughter. However, Lucie genuinely cares about Carton's welfare and defends him when he is criticised by others. She is the \"golden thread\" after whom Book the Second is named, so called because she holds her father's and her family's lives together (and because of her blonde hair like her mother's). She also ties nearly every character in the book together.[11]\n\n\n**Chapter 5**\n\n\n\n* **Monsieur Defarge**: Given name Ernest, he is the owner of a Paris wine shop and leader of the Jacquerie. \"A bull-necked, martial-looking man of thirty ... He was a dark man altogether, with good eyes and a good bold breadth between them.\" He is devoted to Dr Manette having been his servant as a youth. One of the key Revolutionary leaders, in which he is known as Jacques Four, he embraces the Revolution as a noble cause, unlike many other revolutionaries. Though he truly believes in the principles of the Revolution, Defarge is far more moderate than some of the other participants (notably his wife).\n* **Madame Defarge**: Given name Thérèse; a vengeful Revolutionary, she is arguably the novel's antagonist and is presented as a more extreme and bloodthirsty personality than her husband Ernest. \"There were many women at that time, upon whom the time laid a dreadfully disfiguring hand; but, there was not one among them more to be dreaded than this ruthless woman ... Of a strong and fearless character, of shrewd sense and readiness, of great determination, of that kind of beauty which not only seems to impart to its possessor firmness and animosity, but to strike into others an instinctive recognition of those qualities.\" The source of her implacable hatred of the Evrémonde family is revealed late in the novel to be the rape of her sister and killing of her brother when she was a child.\n* **Jacques One, Two, and Three**: Revolutionary compatriots of Ernest Defarge. Jacques Three is especially bloodthirsty and serves as a juryman on the Revolutionary Tribunals.\n\n\n**Chapter 6**\n\n\n\n* **Dr Alexandre Manette**: Lucie's father; when the book opens, he has just been released after a ghastly 18 years as a prisoner in the Bastille. Weak, afraid of sudden noises, barely able to carry on a conversation, he is taken in by his faithful former servant Defarge who then turns him over to Jarvis Lorry and the daughter he has never met. He achieves recovery and contentment with her, her eventual husband Charles Darnay, and their little daughter. All his happiness is put at risk in Book the Third when Madame Defarge resolves to send Evrémonde/Darnay to the guillotine, regardless of his having renounced the Evrémondes' wealth and cruelty. At the same time, the reader learns the cause of Dr Manette's imprisonment: he had rendered medical care to Madame Defarge's brother and sister following the injuries inflicted on them by the Evrémonde twins back in 1757; the Evrémondes decided he couldn't be allowed to expose them.\n\n\n### Book the Second (Five years later)[edit]\n\n\n**Chapter 1**\n\n\n\n* **Mrs Cruncher**: Wife of Jerry Cruncher. She is a very religious woman, but her husband, somewhat paranoid, claims she is praying (what he calls \"flopping\") against him, and that is why he does not often succeed at work. Jerry often verbally and, almost as often, physically abuses her, but at the end of the story, he appears to feel somewhat guilty about this.\n* **Young Jerry Cruncher**: Son of Jerry and Mrs Cruncher. Young Jerry often follows his father around to his father's odd jobs, and at one point in the story, follows his father at night and discovers that his father is a Resurrection Man. Young Jerry looks up to his father as a role model and aspires to become a Resurrection Man himself when he grows up.\n\n\n**Chapter 2**\n\n\n\n* **Charles Darnay**: A Frenchman of the noble Evrémonde family; \"...a young man of about five-and-twenty, well-grown and well-looking, with a sunburnt cheek and a dark eye.\" When introduced, he is on trial for his life at the Old Bailey on charges of spying on behalf of the French crown. In disgust at the cruelty of his family to the French peasantry, he took on the name \"Darnay\" (after his mother's maiden name, D'Aulnais) and left France for England.[12] He and Lucie Manette fall deeply in love, they marry, and she gives birth to a daughter. He exhibits an admirable honesty in his decision to reveal to Dr Manette his true identity as a member of the infamous Evrémonde family. He puts his family's happiness at risk with his courageous decision to return to Paris to save the imprisoned Gabelle, who, unbeknownst to him, has been coerced into luring him there. Once in Paris, he is stunned to discover that, regardless of his rejection of his family's exploitative and abusive record, he is imprisoned incommunicado simply for being an aristocrat. Released after the testimony of Dr Manette, he is re-arrested and sentenced to be guillotined owing to Madame Defarge's undying hatred of all Evrémondes. This death sentence provides the pretext for the novel's climax.\n\n\n**Chapter 3**\n\n\n\n* **John Barsad** *(real name Solomon Pross)*: An informer in London and later employed by the Marquis St. Evrémonde. When introduced at Charles Darnay's trial, he is giving damning evidence against the defendant but it becomes clear to the reader that he is an oily, untrustworthy character. Moving to Paris he takes service as a police spy in the Saint Antoine district, under the French monarchy. Following the Revolution, he becomes an agent for Revolutionary France (at which point he must hide his British identity). Although a man of low character, his position as a spy allows him to arrange for Sydney Carton's final heroic act (after Carton blackmails him with revealing his duplicity).\n* **Roger Cly**: Barsad's collaborator in spying and giving questionable testimony. Following his chaotic funeral procession in Book the Second, Chapter 14, his coffin is dug up by Jerry Cruncher and his fellow Resurrection Men. In Book the Third, Jerry Cruncher reveals that in fact the casket contained only rocks and that Cly was clearly still alive and no doubt carrying on his spying activities.\n* **Mr Stryver**: An ambitious barrister, senior partner to Sydney Carton.[13] \"... a man of little more than thirty, but looking twenty years older than he was, stout, loud, red, bluff, and free from any drawback of delicacy...\"; he wants to marry Lucie Manette because he believes that she is attractive enough. However, he is not truly in love with her and in fact treats her condescendingly. Jarvis Lorry suggests that marrying Lucie would be unwise and Stryver, after thinking it over, talks himself out of it, later marrying a rich widow instead.\n* **Sydney Carton**: A quick-minded and highly intelligent but depressed English barrister, referred to by Dickens as \"The Jackal\" because of his deference to Stryver. When introduced, he is a hard-drinking cynic, having watched Stryver advance while never taking advantage of his own considerable gifts: Dickens writes that the sun rose \"upon no sadder sight than the man of good abilities and good emotions, incapable of their directed exercise, incapable of his own help and his own happiness, sensible to the blight on him, and resigning himself to let it eat him away.\" In love with Lucie Manette, she cares about him but more as a concerned mother figure than a potential mate. He ultimately becomes a selfless hero, redeeming everything by sacrificing his life for a worthy cause.\n\n\n**Chapter 6**\n\n\n\n* **Miss Pross**: Lucie Manette's governess since Lucie was 10 years old: \"... one of those unselfish creatures—found only among women—who will, for pure love and admiration, bind themselves willing slaves, to youth when they have lost it, to beauty that they never had...\" She is fiercely loyal to Lucie and to England. She believes her long-lost brother Solomon, now the spy and perjurer John Barsad, is \"the one man worthy of Ladybird,\" ignoring the fact that he \"was a heartless scoundrel who had stripped her of everything she possessed, as a stake to speculate with, and had abandoned her in her poverty for evermore...\" She is not afraid to physically fight those she believes are endangering the people she loves. She permanently loses her hearing when the fatal pistol shot goes off during her climactic fight with Madame Defarge.\n\n\n**Chapter 7**\n\n\n\n> \n> It took four men, all four a-blaze with gorgeous decoration, and the Chief of them unable to exist with fewer than two gold watches in his pocket, emulative of the noble and chaste fashion set by Monseigneur, to conduct the happy chocolate to Monseigneur's lips.\n> \n> \n> It was impossible for Monseigneur to dispense with one of these attendants on the chocolate and hold his high place under the admiring Heavens. Deep would have been the blot upon his escutcheon if his chocolate had been ignobly waited on by only three men; he must have died of two.\n> \n> \n> \n>\n\n> \n> And who among the company at Monseigneur's reception in that seventeen hundred and eightieth year of our Lord, could possibly doubt, that a system rooted in a frizzled hangman, powdered, gold-laced, pumped, and white-silk stockinged, would see the very stars out!\n> \n> \n> \n>\n\n* **\"Monseigneur\"**: An unnamed generic aristocrat whose extraordinary decadence and self-absorption, described in detail, are used by Dickens to characterise the *ancien régime* in general. \"The leprosy of unreality disfigured every human creature in attendance upon Monseigneur.\" His fellow nobles also luxuriate in vast wealth, but this does not inoculate them from feeling envy and resentment: as the Marquis St. Evrémonde leaves Monseigneur's house \"with his hat under his arm and his snuff-box in his hand\", he turns to the latter's bedroom and quietly says, \"I devote you ... to the Devil!\" When the Revolution begins, Monseigneur puts on his cook's clothing and ignominiously flees, escaping with only his life.\n* **Marquis St. Evrémonde**:[14] Uncle of Charles Darnay: \"...a man of about sixty, handsomely dressed, haughty in manner, and with a face like a fine mask.\" Determined to preserve the traditional prerogatives of the nobility until the end of his life, he is the twin brother of Charles Darnay's late father; both men were exceptionally arrogant and cruel to peasants. Lamenting reforms which have imposed some restraints on the abusive powers of his class, the Marquis is out of favour at the royal court at the time of his assassination. Murdered in his bed by the peasant Gaspard.\n* **Gaspard**: A peasant whose child is run over and killed by the Marquis St. Evrémonde's carriage. He plunges a knife into Evrémonde's heart, pinning a note that reads, \"Drive him fast to his tomb,\" a reference to the careless speed that caused his little child's death. After being in hiding for a year, he is found, arrested, and executed.\n* **The Mender of Roads**: A peasant who later works as a woodsawyer; the Defarges bring him into a conspiracy against the aristocracy, where he is referred to as Jacques Five.\n\n\n**Chapter 8**\n\n\n\n* **Théophile Gabelle**: Gabelle is \"the Postmaster, and some other taxing functionary, united\"[15] for the tenants of the Marquis St. Evrémonde. Gabelle is imprisoned by the revolutionaries, and his beseeching letter brings Darnay to France. Gabelle is \"named after the hated salt tax\".[16]\n\n\n### Book the Third (Autumn 1792)[edit]\n\n\n**Chapter 3**\n\n\n\n* **The Vengeance**: A companion of Madame Defarge referred to as her \"shadow\" and lieutenant, a member of the sisterhood of women revolutionaries in Saint Antoine, and Revolutionary zealot. (Many Frenchmen and women did change their names to show their enthusiasm for the Revolution.[17]) Carton predicts that the Vengeance, Defarge, Cly, and Barsad will be consumed by the Revolution and end up on the guillotine.\n\n\n**Chapter 13**\n\n\n\n* **The Seamstress**: \"...a young woman, with a slight girlish form, a sweet spare face in which there was no vestige of colour, and large widely opened patient eyes...\" Having been caught up in The Terror, she strikes up a conversation with the man she assumes is Evrémonde in the large room where the next day's guillotine victims are gathered. When she realises that another man has taken Charles Darnay's place, she admires his sacrifice and asks if she can hold his hand during their tumbril ride to the place of execution.\n\n\n## Sources[edit]\n\n\nWhile performing in *The Frozen Deep*, Dickens was given a play to read called *The Dead Heart* by Watts Phillips which had the historical setting, the basic storyline, and the climax that Dickens used in *A Tale of Two Cities*.[18] The play was produced while *A Tale of Two Cities* was being serialised in *All the Year Round* and led to talk of plagiarism.[19]\n\n\nOther sources are *The French Revolution: A History* by Thomas Carlyle (especially important for the novel's rhetoric and symbolism);[20] *Zanoni* by Edward Bulwer-Lytton; *The Castle Spector* by Matthew Lewis; *Travels in France* by Arthur Young; and *Tableau de Paris* by Louis-Sébastien Mercier. Dickens also used material from an account of imprisonment during the Terror by Beaumarchais, and records of the trial of a French spy published in *The Annual Register*.[21]\n\n\nResearch published in *The Dickensian* in 1963 suggests that the house at 1 Greek Street, now The House of St Barnabas, forms the basis for Dr Manette and Lucie's London house.[22]\n\n\n\n\n> In a building at the back, attainable by a courtyard where a plane tree rustled its green leaves, church organs claimed to be made, and likewise gold to be beaten by some mysterious giant who had a golden arm starting out of the wall ... as if he had beaten himself precious.[23]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe \"golden arm\" (an arm-and-hammer symbol, an ancient sign of the gold-beater's craft) is now housed at the Charles Dickens Museum, but a modern replica could be seen sticking out of the wall near the Pillars of Hercules pub at the western end of Manette Street (formerly Rose Street),[24] until this building was demolished in 2017.\n\n\n\n## Publication history[edit]\n\n\nThe 45-chapter novel was published in 31 weekly instalments in Dickens's new literary periodical titled *All the Year Round*. From April to November of 1859, Dickens also republished the chapters as eight monthly sections in green covers. All but three of Dickens's previous novels had appeared as monthly instalments prior to publication as books. The first weekly instalment of *A Tale of Two Cities* ran in the first issue of *All the Year Round* on 30 April 1859. The last ran 30 weeks later, on 26 November.[1]\n\n\n*The Telegraph* and *The Guardian* claim that it is one of the best-selling novels of all time.[2][3][25] WorldCat listed 1,529 editions of the work, including 1,305 print editions.[26]\n\n\n\n## Analysis[edit]\n\n\n*A Tale of Two Cities* is one of only two works of historical fiction by Charles Dickens (the other being *Barnaby Rudge*).[27]\n\n\nDickens uses literal translations of French idioms for characters who cannot speak English, such as \"What the devil do you do in that galley there?!!\" and \"Where is my wife? … Here you see me.\"[28] The Penguin Classics edition of the novel notes that \"Not all readers have regarded the experiment as a success.\"[28]\n\n\nJ. L. Borges quipped: \"Dickens lived in London. In his book *A Tale of Two Cities*, based on the French Revolution, we see that he really could not write a tale of two cities. He was a resident of just one city: London.\"[29]\n\n\nIn the Introduction to the *Encyclopedia of Adventure Fiction*, critic Don D'Ammassa argues that it is an adventure novel because the protagonists are in constant danger of being imprisoned or killed.[30]\n\n\n\n### Opening lines[edit]\n\n\nSeveral pairs of contrasting words in the opening lines have been interpreted to illustrate the dichotomous climate of the social disparities between the French\nbourgeoisie and aristocracy around the time of French Revolution.[31]\n\n\n\n### Autobiographical material[edit]\n\n\nSome have argued that in *A Tale of Two Cities* Dickens reflects on his recently begun affair with eighteen-year-old actress Ellen Ternan, which was possibly platonic but certainly romantic. Lucie Manette has been noted as resembling Ternan physically.[32]\n\n\nAfter starring in a play by Wilkie Collins titled *The Frozen Deep*, Dickens was first inspired to write *Two Cities*. In the play, Dickens played the part of a man who sacrifices his own life so that his rival may have the woman they both love; the love triangle in the play became the basis for the relationships among Charles Darnay, Lucie Manette, and Sydney Carton in *Two Cities*.[33]\n\n\nSydney Carton and Charles Darnay may bear importantly on Dickens's personal life. The plot hinges on the near-perfect resemblance between Sydney Carton and Charles Darnay; the two look so alike that Carton twice saves Darnay through the inability of others to tell them apart. Carton is Darnay made bad. Carton suggests as much:\n\n\n\n\n> 'Do you particularly like the man [Darnay]?' he muttered, at his own image [which he is regarding in a mirror]; 'why should you particularly like a man who resembles you? There is nothing in you to like; you know that. Ah, confound you! What a change you have made in yourself! A good reason for talking to a man, that he shows you what you have fallen away from and what you might have been! Change places with him, and would you have been looked at by those blue eyes [belonging to Lucie Manette] as he was, and commiserated by that agitated face as he was? Come on, and have it out in plain words! You hate the fellow.'[34]\n> \n> \n\n\nMany have felt that Carton and Darnay are doppelgängers, which Eric Rabkin defines as a pair \"of characters that together, represent one psychological persona in the narrative\".[35] If so, they would prefigure such works as Robert Louis Stevenson's *Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde*. Darnay is worthy and respectable but dull (at least to most modern readers), Carton disreputable but magnetic.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nOne can only suspect whose psychological persona it is that Carton and Darnay together embody (if they do), but it is often thought to be the psyche of Dickens. He might have been quite aware that between them, Carton and Darnay shared his own initials, a frequent property of his characters.[36] However, he denied it when asked.\n\n\nDickens dedicated the book to the Whig and Liberal prime minister Lord John Russell: \"In remembrance of many public services and private kindnesses.\"[37]\n\n\n\n## Contemporary criticisms[edit]\n\n\nThe reports published in the press were divergent. Thomas Carlyle was enthusiastic, which made the author \"heartily delighted\".[38] On the other hand, Mrs. Oliphant found \"little of Dickens\" in the novel.[39] The critic James Fitzjames Stephen called it a \"dish of puppy pie and stewed cat which is not disguised by the cooking\" and \"a disjointed framework for the display of the tawdry wares, which are Mr Dickens's stock-in-trade.[40]\n\n\n\n## Adaptations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Classic Comics* issue #6\n### Films[edit]\n\n\n* *A Tale of Two Cities*, a 1911 silent film.\n* *A Tale of Two Cities*, a 1917 silent film.\n* *A Tale of Two Cities*, a 1922 silent film.\n* *The Only Way*, a 1927 silent British film directed by Herbert Wilcox.\n* *A Tale of Two Cities*, a 1935 black-and-white film starring Ronald Colman, Elizabeth Allan, Reginald Owen, Basil Rathbone, and Edna May Oliver, nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.\n* *A Tale of Two Cities*, a 1958 version, starring Dirk Bogarde, Dorothy Tutin, Christopher Lee, Leo McKern, and Donald Pleasence.\n* *A Tale of Two Cities*, a 1980 version, starring Chris Sarandon, Alice Krige and Kenneth More.\n\n\n### Radio[edit]\n\n\n* On 8 April 1935, WCAE in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, presented *A Tale of Two Cities* \"in chapter sequence\" on Monday nights.[41]\n* On 25 July 1938, *The Mercury Theatre on the Air* produced a radio adaptation starring Orson Welles.

The character of Bane is in part inspired by Dickens's Madame Defarge: He organises kangaroo court trials against the ruling elite of the city of Gotham and is seen knitting in one of the trial scenes like Madame Defarge. There are other hints to Dickens's novel, such as Talia al Ghul being obsessed with revenge and having a close relationship to the hero, and Bane's catchphrase \"the fire rises\" as an ode to one of the book's chapters.[54] Bane's associate Barsard is named after a supporting character in the novel. In the film's final scene, Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) reads aloud the closing lines of Sydney Carton’s inner monologue—\"It's a far far better thing I do than I have ever done, it's a far far better rest I go to than I have ever known\"—directly from the novel.[55]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Facsimile of the original 1st publication of \"A Tale of Two Cities\" in All the year round\".

The novel tells the story of the French Doctor Manette, his 18-year-long imprisonment in the Bastille in Paris, and his release to live in London with his daughter Lucie whom he had never met. The story is set against the conditions that led up to the French Revolution and the Reign of Terror. \n\n\nAs Dickens's best-known work of historical fiction, *A Tale of Two Cities* is said to be one of the best-selling novels of all time.[2][3][4] In 2003, the novel was ranked 63rd on the BBC's The Big Read poll.[5] The novel has been adapted for film, television, radio, and the stage, and has continued to influence popular culture.\n\n\n\n\n## Synopsis[edit]\n\n\n### Book the First: Recalled to Life[edit]\n\n\n#### Opening lines[edit]\n\n\nDickens opens the novel with a sentence that has become famous:\n\n\n> It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way—in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.[6]\n> \n> \n\n\n#### Plot of the first book[edit]\n\n\nIn 1775, Jerry Cruncher flags down the nightly mail-coach en route from London to Dover. Cruncher is an employee of Tellson's Bank in London; he carries a message for Jarvis Lorry, one of the bank's managers. Lorry sends Jerry back with the cryptic response \"Recalled to Life\", referring to Alexandre Manette, a French physician who has been released from the Bastille after an 18-year imprisonment. On arrival in Dover, Lorry meets Dr Manette's daughter Lucie and her governess, Miss Pross. Believing her father to be dead, Lucie faints at the news that he is alive. Lorry takes her to France for a reunion.\n\n\nIn the Paris neighbourhood of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, Dr Manette has been given lodgings by his former servant Ernest Defarge and his wife Therese, the owners of a wine shop. Lorry and Lucie find him in a small garret where he spends much of his time distractedly and obsessively making shoes – a skill he learned in prison. Lorry and Lucie take him back to England.\n\n\n\n### Book the Second: The Golden Thread[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\"The Sea Still Rises\", an illustration for Book 2, Chapter 22 by \"Phiz\"\n#### Plot of the second book[edit]\n\n\nIn 1780, French émigré Charles Darnay is on trial in London for treason against the British Crown. The key witnesses against him are two British spies, John Barsad and Roger Cly. Barsad claims that he would recognise Darnay anywhere, but Darnay's lawyer points out that his colleague in court, Sydney Carton, bears a strong resemblance to the prisoner. With Barsad's testimony thus undermined, Darnay is acquitted.\n\n\nIn Paris, the hated and abusive Marquis St. Evrémonde orders his carriage driven recklessly fast through the crowded streets, hitting and killing a child. The Marquis throws a coin to the child's father, Gaspard, to compensate him for his loss; as the Marquis drives on, a coin is flung back into the carriage.\n\n\nArriving at his country château, the Marquis meets Darnay, who is his nephew and heir. Out of disgust with his aristocratic family, the nephew has shed his real surname (St. Evrémonde) and anglicised his mother's maiden name, D'Aulnais, to Darnay. He despises the Marquis' views that \"Repression is the only lasting philosophy. The dark deference of fear and slavery ... will keep the dogs obedient to the whip, as long as this roof [looking up to it] shuts out the sky.\"[7] That night, Gaspard creeps into the château and stabs and kills the Marquis in his sleep. He avoids capture for nearly a year, but is eventually hanged in the nearby village.\n\n\nIn London, Carton confesses his love to Lucie, but quickly recognises that she cannot love him in return. Carton nevertheless promises to \"embrace any sacrifice for you and for those dear to you\".[8] Darnay asks for Dr Manette's permission to wed Lucie, and he agrees. On the morning of the marriage, Darnay reveals his real name and lineage to Dr Manette, facts that Manette had asked him to withhold until that day. The unexpected revelation causes Dr Manette to revert to his obsessive shoemaking. He returns to sanity before their return from honeymoon, and the whole incident is kept secret from Lucie.\n\n\nAs the years pass, Lucie and Charles raise a family in England: a son (who dies in childhood) and a daughter, little Lucie. Lorry finds a second home with them. Carton, though he seldom visits, is accepted as a close friend and becomes a special favourite of little Lucie.\n\n\nIn Paris in July 1789, the Defarges help to lead the storming of the Bastille, a symbol of royal tyranny. Defarge enters Dr Manette's former cell, One Hundred and Five, North Tower, and searches it thoroughly. Throughout the countryside, local officials and other representatives of the aristocracy are slaughtered, and the St. Evrémonde château is burned to the ground.\n\n\nIn 1792, Lorry travels to France to save important documents stored at Tellson's Paris branch from the chaos of the French Revolution. Darnay receives a letter from Gabelle, one of his uncle's former servants who has been imprisoned by the revolutionaries, pleading for Darnay (now the Marquis St. Evrémonde) to help secure his release. Without telling his family or revealing his position as the new Marquis, Darnay also sets out for Paris.\n\n\n\n### Book the Third: The Track of a Storm[edit]\n\n\n#### Plot of the third book[edit]\n\n\nOn his way to Paris, Darnay is arrested as a returning emigrated aristocrat and jailed in La Force Prison. Hoping to be able to save him, Dr Manette, Lucie and her daughter, Jerry, and Miss Pross all move to Paris and take up lodgings near those of Lorry.\n\n\nFifteen months later Darnay is finally tried, and Dr Manette – viewed as a popular hero after his long imprisonment in the Bastille – testifies on his behalf. Darnay is acquitted and released, but is re-arrested later that day.\n\n\nWhile running errands with Jerry, Miss Pross is amazed to run into her long-lost brother Solomon. Now posing as a Frenchman, he is an employee of the revolutionary authorities and one of Darnay's gaolers. Carton also recognises him – as Barsad, one of the spies who tried to frame Darnay at his trial in 1780. Solomon is desperate to keep his true identity hidden, and by threatening to denounce him as an English spy Carton blackmails Solomon into helping with a plan.\n\n\nDarnay's retrial the following day is based on new denunciations by the Defarges, and on a manuscript that Defarge had found when searching Dr Manette's prison cell. Defarge reads the manuscript to the tribunal. In it, Dr Manette had recorded that his imprisonment was at the hands of the Evrémonde brothers (Darnay's father and uncle) after he had tried to report their crimes. Darnay's uncle had kidnapped and raped a peasant girl. Her brother, first hiding his remaining younger sister, had gone to confront the uncle, who ran him through with his sword. In spite of the best efforts of Dr Manette, both the elder sister and the brother died. Dr Manette's manuscript concludes by denouncing the Evrémondes, \"them and their descendants, to the last of their race.\"[9] The jury takes that as irrefutable proof of Darnay's guilt, and he is condemned to die by the guillotine the next afternoon.\n\n\nIn the Defarges' wine shop, Carton discovers that Madame Defarge was the surviving sister of the peasant family, and he overhears her planning to denounce both Lucie and her daughter. He visits Lorry and warns him that Lucie and her family must be ready to flee the next day. He extracts a promise that Lorry and the family will be waiting for him in the carriage at 2 pm, ready to leave the very instant he returns.\n\n\nShortly before the executions are due to begin, Carton puts his plan into effect and, with Barsad's reluctant assistance, obtains access to Darnay's prison cell. Carton intends to be executed in Darnay's place. He drugs Darnay and trades clothes with him, then has Barsad carry Darnay out to the carriage where Lorry and the family are expecting Carton. They flee to England with Darnay, who gradually regains consciousness during the journey.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Madame Defarge goes to Lucie's lodgings, hoping to apprehend her and her daughter. There she finds Miss Pross, who is waiting for Jerry so they can follow the family out of Paris. The two women struggle and Madame Defarge's pistol discharges, killing her outright and permanently deafening Miss Pross.\n\n\n\n![](image)The seamstress and Carton, an illustration for Book 3, Chapter 15 by John McLenan (1859)\nAs Carton waits to board the tumbril that will take him to his execution, he is approached by another prisoner, a seamstress. Carton comforts her, telling her that their ends will be quick and that the worries of their lives will not follow them into \"the better land where ... [they] will be mercifully sheltered.\" A final prophetic thought runs through his mind in which he visualises a better future for the family and their descendants.\n\n\n\n#### Closing lines[edit]\n\n\nDickens closes with Carton's final prophetic vision as he contemplates the guillotine:[10]\n\n\n\n\n> I see Barsad, and Cly, Defarge, The Vengeance [a lieutenant of Madame Defarge], the Juryman, the Judge, long ranks of the new oppressors who have risen on the destruction of the old, perishing by this retributive instrument, before it shall cease out of its present use. I see a beautiful city and a brilliant people rising from this abyss, and, in their struggles to be truly free, in their triumphs and defeats, through long years to come, I see the evil of this time and of the previous time of which this is the natural birth, gradually making expiation for itself and wearing out.\n> \n> \n> \n> I see the lives for which I lay down my life, peaceful, useful, prosperous and happy, in that England which I shall see no more. I see Her with a child upon her bosom, who bears my name. I see her father, aged and bent, but otherwise restored, and faithful to all men in his healing office, and at peace. I see the good old man [Lorry], so long their friend, in ten years' time enriching them with all he has, and passing tranquilly to his reward.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n> I see that I hold a sanctuary in their hearts, and in the hearts of their descendants, generations hence. I see her, an old woman, weeping for me on the anniversary of this day. I see her and her husband, their course done, lying side by side in their last earthly bed, and I know that each was not more honoured and held sacred in the other's soul than I was in the souls of both.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n> I see that child who lay upon her bosom and who bore my name, a man winning his way up in that path of life which once was mine. I see him winning it so well, that my name is made illustrious there by the light of his. I see the blots I threw upon it, faded away. I see him, fore-most of just judges and honoured men, bringing a boy of my name, with a forehead that I know and golden hair, to this place—then fair to look upon, with not a trace of this day's disfigurement—and I hear him tell the child my story, with a tender and a faltering voice.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n> It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.\n> \n> \n\n\n## Characters[edit]\n\n\nIn order of appearance:\n\n\n\n### Book the First (November 1775)[edit]\n\n\n**Chapter 2**\n\n\n\n![](image)Illustration from a serialised edition of the story, showing three tricoteuses knitting, with the Vengeance standing in the centre.\n* **Jerry Cruncher**: Porter and messenger for Tellson's Bank and secret \"Resurrection Man\" (body-snatcher); though rough and abusive towards his wife, he provides courageous service to the Manettes in Book the Third. His first name is short for Jeremiah; the latter name shares a meaning with the name of Jarvis Lorry.\n* **Jarvis Lorry**: A manager at Tellson's Bank: \"...a gentleman of 60 ... Very orderly and methodical he looked ... He had a good leg, and was a little vain of it...\" He is a dear friend of Dr Manette and serves as a sort of trustee and guardian of the Manette family. The bank places him in charge of the Paris branch during the Revolution, putting him in position to provide life-saving service to the Manettes in Book the Third. The end of the book reveals that he lives to be 88.\n\n\n**Chapter 4**\n\n\n\n* **Lucie Manette**: Daughter of Dr Manette; an ideal pre-Victorian lady, perfect in every way. About 17 when the novel begins, she is described as short and slight with a \"pretty figure, a quantity of golden hair, a pair of blue eyes...\" Although Sydney Carton is in love with her, he declares himself an unsuitable candidate for her hand in marriage and instead she marries Charles Darnay, with whom she is very much in love, and bears him a daughter. However, Lucie genuinely cares about Carton's welfare and defends him when he is criticised by others. She is the \"golden thread\" after whom Book the Second is named, so called because she holds her father's and her family's lives together (and because of her blonde hair like her mother's). She also ties nearly every character in the book together.[11]\n\n\n**Chapter 5**\n\n\n\n* **Monsieur Defarge**: Given name Ernest, he is the owner of a Paris wine shop and leader of the Jacquerie. \"A bull-necked, martial-looking man of thirty ... He was a dark man altogether, with good eyes and a good bold breadth between them.\" He is devoted to Dr Manette having been his servant as a youth. One of the key Revolutionary leaders, in which he is known as Jacques Four, he embraces the Revolution as a noble cause, unlike many other revolutionaries. Though he truly believes in the principles of the Revolution, Defarge is far more moderate than some of the other participants (notably his wife).\n* **Madame Defarge**: Given name Thérèse; a vengeful Revolutionary, she is arguably the novel's antagonist and is presented as a more extreme and bloodthirsty personality than her husband Ernest. \"There were many women at that time, upon whom the time laid a dreadfully disfiguring hand; but, there was not one among them more to be dreaded than this ruthless woman ... Of a strong and fearless character, of shrewd sense and readiness, of great determination, of that kind of beauty which not only seems to impart to its possessor firmness and animosity, but to strike into others an instinctive recognition of those qualities.\" The source of her implacable hatred of the Evrémonde family is revealed late in the novel to be the rape of her sister and killing of her brother when she was a child.\n* **Jacques One, Two, and Three**: Revolutionary compatriots of Ernest Defarge. Jacques Three is especially bloodthirsty and serves as a juryman on the Revolutionary Tribunals.\n\n\n**Chapter 6**\n\n\n\n* **Dr Alexandre Manette**: Lucie's father; when the book opens, he has just been released after a ghastly 18 years as a prisoner in the Bastille. Weak, afraid of sudden noises, barely able to carry on a conversation, he is taken in by his faithful former servant Defarge who then turns him over to Jarvis Lorry and the daughter he has never met. He achieves recovery and contentment with her, her eventual husband Charles Darnay, and their little daughter. All his happiness is put at risk in Book the Third when Madame Defarge resolves to send Evrémonde/Darnay to the guillotine, regardless of his having renounced the Evrémondes' wealth and cruelty. At the same time, the reader learns the cause of Dr Manette's imprisonment: he had rendered medical care to Madame Defarge's brother and sister following the injuries inflicted on them by the Evrémonde twins back in 1757; the Evrémondes decided he couldn't be allowed to expose them.\n\n\n### Book the Second (Five years later)[edit]\n\n\n**Chapter 1**\n\n\n\n* **Mrs Cruncher**: Wife of Jerry Cruncher. She is a very religious woman, but her husband, somewhat paranoid, claims she is praying (what he calls \"flopping\") against him, and that is why he does not often succeed at work. Jerry often verbally and, almost as often, physically abuses her, but at the end of the story, he appears to feel somewhat guilty about this.\n* **Young Jerry Cruncher**: Son of Jerry and Mrs Cruncher. Young Jerry often follows his father around to his father's odd jobs, and at one point in the story, follows his father at night and discovers that his father is a Resurrection Man. Young Jerry looks up to his father as a role model and aspires to become a Resurrection Man himself when he grows up.\n\n\n**Chapter 2**\n\n\n\n* **Charles Darnay**: A Frenchman of the noble Evrémonde family; \"...a young man of about five-and-twenty, well-grown and well-looking, with a sunburnt cheek and a dark eye.\" When introduced, he is on trial for his life at the Old Bailey on charges of spying on behalf of the French crown. In disgust at the cruelty of his family to the French peasantry, he took on the name \"Darnay\" (after his mother's maiden name, D'Aulnais) and left France for England.[12] He and Lucie Manette fall deeply in love, they marry, and she gives birth to a daughter. He exhibits an admirable honesty in his decision to reveal to Dr Manette his true identity as a member of the infamous Evrémonde family. He puts his family's happiness at risk with his courageous decision to return to Paris to save the imprisoned Gabelle, who, unbeknownst to him, has been coerced into luring him there. Once in Paris, he is stunned to discover that, regardless of his rejection of his family's exploitative and abusive record, he is imprisoned incommunicado simply for being an aristocrat. Released after the testimony of Dr Manette, he is re-arrested and sentenced to be guillotined owing to Madame Defarge's undying hatred of all Evrémondes. This death sentence provides the pretext for the novel's climax.\n\n\n**Chapter 3**\n\n\n\n* **John Barsad** *(real name Solomon Pross)*: An informer in London and later employed by the Marquis St. Evrémonde. When introduced at Charles Darnay's trial, he is giving damning evidence against the defendant but it becomes clear to the reader that he is an oily, untrustworthy character. Moving to Paris he takes service as a police spy in the Saint Antoine district, under the French monarchy. Following the Revolution, he becomes an agent for Revolutionary France (at which point he must hide his British identity). Although a man of low character, his position as a spy allows him to arrange for Sydney Carton's final heroic act (after Carton blackmails him with revealing his duplicity).\n* **Roger Cly**: Barsad's collaborator in spying and giving questionable testimony. Following his chaotic funeral procession in Book the Second, Chapter 14, his coffin is dug up by Jerry Cruncher and his fellow Resurrection Men. In Book the Third, Jerry Cruncher reveals that in fact the casket contained only rocks and that Cly was clearly still alive and no doubt carrying on his spying activities.\n* **Mr Stryver**: An ambitious barrister, senior partner to Sydney Carton.[13] \"... a man of little more than thirty, but looking twenty years older than he was, stout, loud, red, bluff, and free from any drawback of delicacy...\"; he wants to marry Lucie Manette because he believes that she is attractive enough. However, he is not truly in love with her and in fact treats her condescendingly. Jarvis Lorry suggests that marrying Lucie would be unwise and Stryver, after thinking it over, talks himself out of it, later marrying a rich widow instead.\n* **Sydney Carton**: A quick-minded and highly intelligent but depressed English barrister, referred to by Dickens as \"The Jackal\" because of his deference to Stryver. When introduced, he is a hard-drinking cynic, having watched Stryver advance while never taking advantage of his own considerable gifts: Dickens writes that the sun rose \"upon no sadder sight than the man of good abilities and good emotions, incapable of their directed exercise, incapable of his own help and his own happiness, sensible to the blight on him, and resigning himself to let it eat him away.\" In love with Lucie Manette, she cares about him but more as a concerned mother figure than a potential mate. He ultimately becomes a selfless hero, redeeming everything by sacrificing his life for a worthy cause.\n\n\n**Chapter 6**\n\n\n\n* **Miss Pross**: Lucie Manette's governess since Lucie was 10 years old: \"... one of those unselfish creatures—found only among women—who will, for pure love and admiration, bind themselves willing slaves, to youth when they have lost it, to beauty that they never had...\" She is fiercely loyal to Lucie and to England. She believes her long-lost brother Solomon, now the spy and perjurer John Barsad, is \"the one man worthy of Ladybird,\" ignoring the fact that he \"was a heartless scoundrel who had stripped her of everything she possessed, as a stake to speculate with, and had abandoned her in her poverty for evermore...\" She is not afraid to physically fight those she believes are endangering the people she loves. She permanently loses her hearing when the fatal pistol shot goes off during her climactic fight with Madame Defarge.\n\n\n**Chapter 7**\n\n\n\n> \n> It took four men, all four a-blaze with gorgeous decoration, and the Chief of them unable to exist with fewer than two gold watches in his pocket, emulative of the noble and chaste fashion set by Monseigneur, to conduct the happy chocolate to Monseigneur's lips.\n> \n> \n> It was impossible for Monseigneur to dispense with one of these attendants on the chocolate and hold his high place under the admiring Heavens. Deep would have been the blot upon his escutcheon if his chocolate had been ignobly waited on by only three men; he must have died of two.\n> \n> \n> \n>\n\n> \n> And who among the company at Monseigneur's reception in that seventeen hundred and eightieth year of our Lord, could possibly doubt, that a system rooted in a frizzled hangman, powdered, gold-laced, pumped, and white-silk stockinged, would see the very stars out!\n> \n> \n> \n>\n\n* **\"Monseigneur\"**: An unnamed generic aristocrat whose extraordinary decadence and self-absorption, described in detail, are used by Dickens to characterise the *ancien régime* in general. \"The leprosy of unreality disfigured every human creature in attendance upon Monseigneur.\" His fellow nobles also luxuriate in vast wealth, but this does not inoculate them from feeling envy and resentment: as the Marquis St. Evrémonde leaves Monseigneur's house \"with his hat under his arm and his snuff-box in his hand\", he turns to the latter's bedroom and quietly says, \"I devote you ... to the Devil!\" When the Revolution begins, Monseigneur puts on his cook's clothing and ignominiously flees, escaping with only his life.\n* **Marquis St. Evrémonde**:[14] Uncle of Charles Darnay: \"...a man of about sixty, handsomely dressed, haughty in manner, and with a face like a fine mask.\" Determined to preserve the traditional prerogatives of the nobility until the end of his life, he is the twin brother of Charles Darnay's late father; both men were exceptionally arrogant and cruel to peasants. Lamenting reforms which have imposed some restraints on the abusive powers of his class, the Marquis is out of favour at the royal court at the time of his assassination. Murdered in his bed by the peasant Gaspard.\n* **Gaspard**: A peasant whose child is run over and killed by the Marquis St. Evrémonde's carriage. He plunges a knife into Evrémonde's heart, pinning a note that reads, \"Drive him fast to his tomb,\" a reference to the careless speed that caused his little child's death. After being in hiding for a year, he is found, arrested, and executed.\n* **The Mender of Roads**: A peasant who later works as a woodsawyer; the Defarges bring him into a conspiracy against the aristocracy, where he is referred to as Jacques Five.\n\n\n**Chapter 8**\n\n\n\n* **Théophile Gabelle**: Gabelle is \"the Postmaster, and some other taxing functionary, united\"[15] for the tenants of the Marquis St. Evrémonde. Gabelle is imprisoned by the revolutionaries, and his beseeching letter brings Darnay to France. Gabelle is \"named after the hated salt tax\".[16]\n\n\n### Book the Third (Autumn 1792)[edit]\n\n\n**Chapter 3**\n\n\n\n* **The Vengeance**: A companion of Madame Defarge referred to as her \"shadow\" and lieutenant, a member of the sisterhood of women revolutionaries in Saint Antoine, and Revolutionary zealot. (Many Frenchmen and women did change their names to show their enthusiasm for the Revolution.[17]) Carton predicts that the Vengeance, Defarge, Cly, and Barsad will be consumed by the Revolution and end up on the guillotine.\n\n\n**Chapter 13**\n\n\n\n* **The Seamstress**: \"...a young woman, with a slight girlish form, a sweet spare face in which there was no vestige of colour, and large widely opened patient eyes...\" Having been caught up in The Terror, she strikes up a conversation with the man she assumes is Evrémonde in the large room where the next day's guillotine victims are gathered. When she realises that another man has taken Charles Darnay's place, she admires his sacrifice and asks if she can hold his hand during their tumbril ride to the place of execution.\n\n\n## Sources[edit]\n\n\nWhile performing in *The Frozen Deep*, Dickens was given a play to read called *The Dead Heart* by Watts Phillips which had the historical setting, the basic storyline, and the climax that Dickens used in *A Tale of Two Cities*.[18] The play was produced while *A Tale of Two Cities* was being serialised in *All the Year Round* and led to talk of plagiarism.[19]\n\n\nOther sources are *The French Revolution: A History* by Thomas Carlyle (especially important for the novel's rhetoric and symbolism);[20] *Zanoni* by Edward Bulwer-Lytton; *The Castle Spector* by Matthew Lewis; *Travels in France* by Arthur Young; and *Tableau de Paris* by Louis-Sébastien Mercier. Dickens also used material from an account of imprisonment during the Terror by Beaumarchais, and records of the trial of a French spy published in *The Annual Register*.[21]\n\n\nResearch published in *The Dickensian* in 1963 suggests that the house at 1 Greek Street, now The House of St Barnabas, forms the basis for Dr Manette and Lucie's London house.[22]\n\n\n\n\n> In a building at the back, attainable by a courtyard where a plane tree rustled its green leaves, church organs claimed to be made, and likewise gold to be beaten by some mysterious giant who had a golden arm starting out of the wall ... as if he had beaten himself precious.[23]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe \"golden arm\" (an arm-and-hammer symbol, an ancient sign of the gold-beater's craft) is now housed at the Charles Dickens Museum, but a modern replica could be seen sticking out of the wall near the Pillars of Hercules pub at the western end of Manette Street (formerly Rose Street),[24] until this building was demolished in 2017.\n\n\n\n## Publication history[edit]\n\n\nThe 45-chapter novel was published in 31 weekly instalments in Dickens's new literary periodical titled *All the Year Round*. From April to November of 1859, Dickens also republished the chapters as eight monthly sections in green covers. All but three of Dickens's previous novels had appeared as monthly instalments prior to publication as books. The first weekly instalment of *A Tale of Two Cities* ran in the first issue of *All the Year Round* on 30 April 1859. The last ran 30 weeks later, on 26 November.[1]\n\n\n*The Telegraph* and *The Guardian* claim that it is one of the best-selling novels of all time.[2][3][25] WorldCat listed 1,529 editions of the work, including 1,305 print editions.[26]\n\n\n\n## Analysis[edit]\n\n\n*A Tale of Two Cities* is one of only two works of historical fiction by Charles Dickens (the other being *Barnaby Rudge*).[27]\n\n\nDickens uses literal translations of French idioms for characters who cannot speak English, such as \"What the devil do you do in that galley there?!!\" and \"Where is my wife? … Here you see me.\"[28] The Penguin Classics edition of the novel notes that \"Not all readers have regarded the experiment as a success.\"[28]\n\n\nJ. L. Borges quipped: \"Dickens lived in London. In his book *A Tale of Two Cities*, based on the French Revolution, we see that he really could not write a tale of two cities. He was a resident of just one city: London.\"[29]\n\n\nIn the Introduction to the *Encyclopedia of Adventure Fiction*, critic Don D'Ammassa argues that it is an adventure novel because the protagonists are in constant danger of being imprisoned or killed.[30]\n\n\n\n### Opening lines[edit]\n\n\nSeveral pairs of contrasting words in the opening lines have been interpreted to illustrate the dichotomous climate of the social disparities between the French\nbourgeoisie and aristocracy around the time of French Revolution.[31]\n\n\n\n### Autobiographical material[edit]\n\n\nSome have argued that in *A Tale of Two Cities* Dickens reflects on his recently begun affair with eighteen-year-old actress Ellen Ternan, which was possibly platonic but certainly romantic. Lucie Manette has been noted as resembling Ternan physically.[32]\n\n\nAfter starring in a play by Wilkie Collins titled *The Frozen Deep*, Dickens was first inspired to write *Two Cities*. In the play, Dickens played the part of a man who sacrifices his own life so that his rival may have the woman they both love; the love triangle in the play became the basis for the relationships among Charles Darnay, Lucie Manette, and Sydney Carton in *Two Cities*.[33]\n\n\nSydney Carton and Charles Darnay may bear importantly on Dickens's personal life. The plot hinges on the near-perfect resemblance between Sydney Carton and Charles Darnay; the two look so alike that Carton twice saves Darnay through the inability of others to tell them apart. Carton is Darnay made bad. Carton suggests as much:\n\n\n\n\n> 'Do you particularly like the man [Darnay]?' he muttered, at his own image [which he is regarding in a mirror]; 'why should you particularly like a man who resembles you? There is nothing in you to like; you know that. Ah, confound you! What a change you have made in yourself! A good reason for talking to a man, that he shows you what you have fallen away from and what you might have been! Change places with him, and would you have been looked at by those blue eyes [belonging to Lucie Manette] as he was, and commiserated by that agitated face as he was? Come on, and have it out in plain words! You hate the fellow.'[34]\n> \n> \n\n\nMany have felt that Carton and Darnay are doppelgängers, which Eric Rabkin defines as a pair \"of characters that together, represent one psychological persona in the narrative\".[35] If so, they would prefigure such works as Robert Louis Stevenson's *Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde*. Darnay is worthy and respectable but dull (at least to most modern readers), Carton disreputable but magnetic.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nOne can only suspect whose psychological persona it is that Carton and Darnay together embody (if they do), but it is often thought to be the psyche of Dickens. He might have been quite aware that between them, Carton and Darnay shared his own initials, a frequent property of his characters.[36] However, he denied it when asked.\n\n\nDickens dedicated the book to the Whig and Liberal prime minister Lord John Russell: \"In remembrance of many public services and private kindnesses.\"[37]\n\n\n\n## Contemporary criticisms[edit]\n\n\nThe reports published in the press were divergent. Thomas Carlyle was enthusiastic, which made the author \"heartily delighted\".[38] On the other hand, Mrs. Oliphant found \"little of Dickens\" in the novel.[39] The critic James Fitzjames Stephen called it a \"dish of puppy pie and stewed cat which is not disguised by the cooking\" and \"a disjointed framework for the display of the tawdry wares, which are Mr Dickens's stock-in-trade.[40]\n\n\n\n## Adaptations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Classic Comics* issue #6\n### Films[edit]\n\n\n* *A Tale of Two Cities*, a 1911 silent film.\n* *A Tale of Two Cities*, a 1917 silent film.\n* *A Tale of Two Cities*, a 1922 silent film.\n* *The Only Way*, a 1927 silent British film directed by Herbert Wilcox.\n* *A Tale of Two Cities*, a 1935 black-and-white film starring Ronald Colman, Elizabeth Allan, Reginald Owen, Basil Rathbone, and Edna May Oliver, nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.\n* *A Tale of Two Cities*, a 1958 version, starring Dirk Bogarde, Dorothy Tutin, Christopher Lee, Leo McKern, and Donald Pleasence.\n* *A Tale of Two Cities*, a 1980 version, starring Chris Sarandon, Alice Krige and Kenneth More.\n\n\n### Radio[edit]\n\n\n* On 8 April 1935, WCAE in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, presented *A Tale of Two Cities* \"in chapter sequence\" on Monday nights.[41]\n* On 25 July 1938, *The Mercury Theatre on the Air* produced a radio adaptation starring Orson Welles.

It received its stage premiere at Sadler's Wells on 22 July 1957, under the baton of Leon Lovett.[53]\n\n\n## Popular culture[edit]\n\n\n*A Tale of Two Cities* served as an inspiration to the 2012 Batman film *The Dark Knight Rises* by Christopher Nolan. The character of Bane is in part inspired by Dickens's Madame Defarge: He organises kangaroo court trials against the ruling elite of the city of Gotham and is seen knitting in one of the trial scenes like Madame Defarge. There are other hints to Dickens's novel, such as Talia al Ghul being obsessed with revenge and having a close relationship to the hero, and Bane's catchphrase \"the fire rises\" as an ode to one of the book's chapters.[54] Bane's associate Barsard is named after a supporting character in the novel. In the film's final scene, Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) reads aloud the closing lines of Sydney Carton’s inner monologue—\"It's a far far better thing I do than I have ever done, it's a far far better rest I go to than I have ever known\"—directly from the novel.[55]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Facsimile of the original 1st publication of \"A Tale of Two Cities\" in All the year round\".

Darnay seems to be referring to the time when his mother brought him, still a child, to her meeting with Dr Manette in Book 3, Chapter 10. But some readers also feel that Darnay is explaining why he changed his name and travelled to England in the first place: to discharge his family's debt to Dr Manette without fully revealing his identity.

It was first published in English and French in the United States by Reynal & Hitchcock in April 1943 and was published posthumously in France following liberation; Saint-Exupéry's works had been banned by the Vichy Regime. The story follows a young prince who visits various planets, including Earth, and addresses themes of loneliness, friendship, love, and loss. Despite its style as a children's book, *The Little Prince* makes observations about life, adults, and human nature.[9]\n\n\n*The Little Prince* became Saint-Exupéry's most successful work, selling an estimated 140 million copies worldwide, which makes it one of the best-selling in history.[10][11][12][Note 2][14] The book has been translated into over 505 different languages and dialects worldwide, being the second most translated work ever published, trailing only the Bible.[15][16][17] *The Little Prince* has been adapted to numerous art forms and media, including audio recordings, radio plays, live stage, film, television, ballet, and opera.[16][18]\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nThe narrator begins with a discussion on the nature of grownups and their inability to perceive \"important things\". As a test to determine if a grownup is as enlightened as a child, he shows them a picture depicting a boa constrictor that has eaten an elephant. The grownups always reply that the picture depicts a hat, and so he knows to only talk of \"reasonable\" things to them, rather than the fanciful.\n\n\nThe narrator becomes an aircraft pilot, and one day, his plane crashes in the Sahara desert, far from civilization. The narrator has an eight-day supply of water and must fix his aeroplane. Here, he is greeted unexpectedly by a young boy nicknamed \"the little prince.\" The prince has golden hair, a loveable laugh, and will repeat questions until they are answered.\n\n\nThe prince asks the narrator to draw a sheep. The narrator first shows him the picture of the elephant inside the snake, which, to the narrator's surprise, the prince interprets correctly. After three failed attempts at drawing a sheep, the frustrated narrator draws a simple crate, claiming the sheep is inside. The prince exclaims that this was exactly the drawing he wanted.\n\n\nOver the course of eight days in the desert, while the narrator attempts to repair his plane, the prince recounts his life story. He begins describing his tiny home planet: in effect, a house-sized asteroid known as \"B 612\" on Earth. The asteroid's most prominent features are three minuscule volcanoes (two active, and one dormant or extinct) and a variety of plants.\n\n\nThe prince describes his earlier days cleaning the volcanoes and weeding unwanted seeds and sprigs that infest his planet's soil; in particular, pulling out baobab trees that are constantly on the verge of overrunning the surface. If the baobabs are not rooted out the moment they are recognised, their roots can have a catastrophic effect on the tiny planet. Therefore, the prince wants a sheep to eat the undesirable plants, but worries it will also eat plants with thorns.\n\n\nThe prince tells of his love for a vain and silly rose that began growing on the asteroid's surface some time ago. The rose is given to pretension, exaggerating ailments to gain attention and have the prince care for her. The prince says he nourished the rose and tended to her, making a screen and glass globe to protect her from the cold and wind, watering her, and keeping the caterpillars off.\n\n\nAlthough the prince fell in love with the rose, he also began to feel that she was taking advantage of him, and he resolved to leave the planet to explore the rest of the universe. Upon their goodbyes, the rose apologises for failing to show that she loved him. She wishes him well and turns down his desire to leave her in the glass globe, saying she will protect herself. The prince laments that he did not understand how to love his rose while he was with her and should have listened to her kind actions, rather than her vain words.\n\n\nThe prince has since visited six other planets, each of which was inhabited by a single, irrational, narrow-minded adult, each meant to critique an element of society. They include:\n\n\n\n* A king with no subjects, who only issues orders that will be followed, such as commanding the sun to set at sunset.\n* A conceited man who only wants the praise which comes from admiration and being the most admirable person on his otherwise uninhabited planet.\n* A drunkard who drinks to forget the shame of drinking.\n* A businessman who is blind to the beauty of the stars and instead endlessly counts and catalogues them in order to \"own\" them all (critiquing materialism).\n* A lamplighter on a planet so small, a full day lasts a minute. He wastes his life blindly following orders to extinguish and relight the lamppost every 30 seconds to correspond with his planet's day and night.\n* An elderly geographer who has never been anywhere, or seen any of the things he records, providing a caricature of specialisation in the contemporary world.\n\n\nIt is the geographer who tells the prince that his rose is an ephemeral being, which is not recorded, and recommends that the prince next visit the planet Earth. The visit to Earth begins with a deeply pessimistic appraisal of humanity. The six absurd people the prince encountered earlier comprise, according to the narrator, just about the entire adult world. On earth there were:\n\n\n\n\n> 111 kings ... 7,000 geographers, 900,000 businessmen, 7,500,000 tipplers, 311,000,000 conceited men; that is to say, about 2,000,000,000 grown-ups.\n> \n> \n\n\nSince the prince landed in a desert, he believed that Earth was uninhabited. He then met a yellow snake that claimed to have the power to return him to his home, if he ever wished to return. The prince next met a desert flower, who told him that she had only seen a handful of men in this part of the world and that they had no roots, letting the wind blow them around and living hard lives. After climbing the highest mountain he had ever seen, the prince hoped to see the whole of Earth, thus finding the people; however, he saw only the enormous, desolate landscape. When the prince called out, his echo answered him, which he interpreted as the voice of a boring person who only repeats what another says.\n\n\nThe prince encountered a whole row of rosebushes, becoming downcast at having once thought that his own rose was unique and thinking his rose had lied about being unique. He began to feel that he was not a great prince at all, as his planet contained only three tiny volcanoes and a flower that he now thought of as common. He laid down on the grass and wept, until a fox came along.\n\n\nThe fox desired to be tamed and taught the prince how to tame him. By being tamed, something goes from being ordinary and just like all the others to being special and unique. There are drawbacks since the connection can lead to sadness and longing when apart.\n\n\nFrom the fox, the prince learns that his rose was indeed unique and special because she was the object of the prince's love and time; he had \"tamed\" her, and now she was more precious than all of the roses he had seen in the garden. Upon their sad departing, the fox imparts a secret: important things can only be seen with the heart, not the eyes.\n\n\nThe prince finally met two people from Earth:\n\n\n\n* A railway switchman who told him how passengers constantly rushed from one place to another aboard trains, never satisfied with where they were and not knowing what they were after; only the children among them ever bothered to look out the windows.\n* A merchant who talked to the prince about his product, a pill that eliminated the need to drink for a week, saving people 53 minutes.\n\n\nBack in the present moment, it is the eighth day after the narrator's plane crash and the narrator and the prince are dying of thirst. The prince has become visibly morose and saddened over his recollections and longs to return home and see his flower.\n\n\nThe prince finds a well, saving them. The narrator later finds the prince talking to the snake, discussing his return home and his desire to see his rose again, who, he worries, has been left to fend for herself. The prince bids an emotional farewell to the narrator and states that if it looks as though he has died, it is only because his body was too heavy to take with him to his planet. The prince warns the narrator not to watch him leave, as it will upset him. The narrator, realising what will happen, refuses to leave the prince's side. The prince consoles the narrator by saying that he only need look at the stars to think of the prince's loveable laughter, and that it will seem as if all the stars are laughing. The prince then walks away from the narrator and allows the snake to bite him, soundlessly falling down.\n\n\nThe next morning, the narrator is unable to find the prince's body. He finally manages to repair his aeroplane and leave the desert. It is left up to the reader to determine if the prince returned home or died. The story ends with a drawing of the landscape where the prince and the narrator met and where the snake took the prince's corporeal life. The narrator requests to be immediately contacted by anyone in that area encountering a small person with golden curls who refuses to answer any questions.\n\n\n\n## Tone and writing style[edit]\n\n\nThe story of *The Little Prince* is recalled in a sombre, measured tone by the pilot-narrator, in memory of his small friend, \"a memorial to the prince—not just to the prince, but also to the time the prince and the narrator had together.\"[19] *The Little Prince* was created when Saint-Exupéry was \"an ex-patriate and distraught about what was going on in his country and in the world.\"[14] According to one analysis, \"the story of the Little Prince features a lot of fantastical, unrealistic elements.... You can't ride a flock of birds to another planet... The fantasy of the Little Prince works because the logic of the story is based on the imagination of children, rather than the strict realism of adults.\"[20]\n\n\nAn exquisite literary perfectionist, akin to the 19th century French poet Stéphane Mallarmé,[21] Saint-Exupéry produced draft pages \"covered with fine lines of handwriting, much of it painstakingly crossed out, with one word left standing where there were a hundred words, one sentence substitut[ing] for a page...\"[22] He worked \"long hours with great concentration.\" According to the author himself, it was extremely difficult to start his creative writing processes.[23] Biographer Paul Webster wrote of the aviator-author's style: \"Behind Saint-Exupéry's quest for perfection was a laborious process of editing and rewriting which reduced original drafts by as much as two-thirds.\"[24] The French author frequently wrote at night, usually starting at about 11 p.m. accompanied by a tray of strong black coffee. In 1942 Saint-Exupéry related to his American English teacher, Adèle Breaux, that at such a time of night he felt \"free\" and able to concentrate, \"writing for hours without feeling tired or sleepy\", until he instantaneously dozed off.[22] He would wake up later, in daylight, still at his desk, with his head on his arms. Saint-Exupéry stated it was the only way he could work, as once he started a writing project it became an obsession.[25]\n\n\nWhile Saint-Exupéry was a native speaker of French, he was never able to achieve anything more than haltingly poor English. Adèle Breaux, his young Northport English tutor to whom he later dedicated a writing (\"For Miss Adèle Breaux, who so gently guided me in the mysteries of the English language\"), related her experiences with her famous student as *Saint-Exupéry in America, 1942–1943: A Memoir*, published in 1971.[26]\n\n\n\"Saint-Exupéry's prodigious writings and studies of literature sometimes gripped him, and on occasion he continued his readings of literary works until moments before take-off on solitary military reconnaissance flights, as he was adept at both reading and writing while flying. Taking off with an open book balanced on his leg, his ground crew would fear his mission would quickly end after contacting something 'very hard'. On one flight, to the chagrin of colleagues awaiting his arrival, he circled the Tunis airport for an hour so that he could finish reading a novel. Saint-Exupéry frequently flew with a lined *carnet* (notebook) during his long, solo flights, and some of his philosophical writings were created during such periods when he could reflect on the world below him, becoming 'enmeshed in a search for ideals which he translated into fable and parable'.\"[27][28]\n\n\n\n## Inspirations[edit]\n\n\n### Events and characters[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Saint-Exupéry next to his downed Simoun (lacking an all-critical radio) after crashing into the Sahara about 3 am during an air race to Saigon, Vietnam. His survival ordeal was about to begin (Egypt, 1935).\nIn *The Little Prince*, its narrator, the pilot, talks of being stranded in the desert beside his crashed aircraft. The account clearly drew on Saint-Exupéry's own experience in the Sahara, an ordeal described in detail in his 1939 memoir *Wind, Sand and Stars* (original French: *Terre des hommes*).[9]\n\n\nOn 30 December 1935, at 2.45am, after 19 hours and 44 minutes in the air, Saint-Exupéry, along with his copilot-navigator André Prévot, crashed in the Sahara desert.[29] They were attempting to break the speed record for a Paris-to-Saigon flight in a then-popular type of air race called a *raid*, that had a prize of 150,000 francs.[30] Their plane was a Caudron C-630 Simoun,[Note 3] and the crash site is thought to have been near to the Wadi Natrun valley, close to the Nile Delta.[31]\n\n\nBoth miraculously survived the crash, only to face rapid dehydration in the intense desert heat.[32] Their maps were primitive and ambiguous. Lost among the sand dunes with a few grapes, a thermos of coffee, a single orange, and some wine, the pair had only one day's worth of liquid. They both began to see mirages, which were quickly followed by more vivid hallucinations. By the second and third days, they were so dehydrated that they stopped sweating altogether. Finally, on the fourth day, a Bedouin on a camel discovered them and administered a native rehydration treatment, which saved Saint-Exupéry's and Prévot's lives.[30]\n\n\nIn the novella, the fox, believed to be modelled after the author's intimate New York City friend, Silvia Hamilton Reinhardt, tells the prince that his rose is unique and special, as she is the one he loves.[33] The novella's iconic phrase, \"One sees clearly only with the heart\" is believed to have been suggested by Reinhardt.\n\n\nThe fearsome, grasping baobab trees, researchers have contended, were meant to represent Nazism attempting to destroy the planet.[33] The little prince's reassurance to the pilot that the prince's body is only an empty shell resembles the last words of Antoine's dying younger brother François, who told the author, from his deathbed: \"Don't worry. I'm all right. I can't help it. It's my body\".[34]\n\n\n\n### Rose[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Rose in *The Little Prince* was likely inspired by Saint-Exupéry's Salvadoran wife, Consuelo (Montreal, 1942)\nMany researchers believe that the prince's kindhearted, but petulant and vain, Rose was inspired by Saint-Exupéry's Salvadoran wife Consuelo de Saint-Exupéry,[33][35] with the small home planet being inspired by El Salvador where he crashed and stayed to recover while being within view of 3 volcanoes, one of which was Ilamatepec, also known as The Santa Ana Volcano.[36] Despite a tumultuous marriage, Saint-Exupéry kept Consuelo close to his heart and portrayed her as the prince's rose, whom he tenderly protects with a wind screen and places under a glass dome on his tiny planet. Saint-Exupéry's infidelity and the doubts of his marriage are symbolized by the vast field of roses the prince encounters during his visit to Earth.[9]\n\n\nThis interpretation was described by biographer Paul Webster who stated she was \"the muse to whom Saint-Exupéry poured out his soul in copious letters ... Consuelo was the rose in *The Little Prince*. \"I should have judged her by her acts and not by her words\", says the prince. \"She wrapped herself around me and enlightened me. I should never have fled. I should have guessed at the tenderness behind her poor ruses.\"[24]\n\n\n\n### Prince[edit]\n\n\nSaint-Exupéry probably has drawn inspiration for the prince's character and appearance from his own self as a youth, as during his early years friends and family called him *le Roi-Soleil* (\"the Sun King\") because of his golden curly hair.[*citation needed*] The author had also met a precocious eight-year-old with curly blond hair while he was residing with a family in Quebec City in 1942, Thomas De Koninck, the son of philosopher Charles De Koninck.[37][38][39] Another possible inspiration for the little prince has been suggested as Land Morrow Lindbergh, the young, golden-haired son of fellow aviator Charles Lindbergh and his wife, Anne Morrow Lindbergh, whom he met during an overnight stay at their Long Island home in 1939.[40][41][Note 4]\n\n\nSome have seen the prince as a Christ figure, as the child is sin-free and \"believes in a life after death\", subsequently returning to his personal heaven.[42] When *Life* photojournalist John Phillips questioned the author-aviator on his inspiration for the child character, Saint-Exupéry told him that one day he looked down on what he thought was a blank sheet and saw a small childlike figure: \"I asked him who he was\", he replied. \"I'm the Little Prince\" was the reply.[43]\n\n\nOne of Saint-Exupéry's earliest literary references to a small prince is to be found in his second news dispatch from Moscow, dated 14 May 1935. In his writings as a special correspondent for *Paris-Soir*, the author described traveling from France to the Soviet Union by train. Late at night, during the trip, he ventured from his first-class accommodation into the third-class carriages, where he came upon large groups of Polish families huddled together, returning to their homeland. His commentary not only described a diminutive prince but also touched on several other themes Saint-Exupéry incorporated into various philosophical writings:[44]\n\n\n\n\n> I sat down [facing a sleeping] couple. Between the man and the woman a child had hollowed himself out a place and fallen asleep. He turned in his slumber, and in the dim lamplight I saw his face. What an adorable face! A golden fruit had been born of these two peasants..... This is a musician's face, I told myself. This is the child Mozart. This is a life full of beautiful promise. Little princes in legends are not different from this. Protected, sheltered, cultivated, what could not this child become? When by mutation a new rose is born in a garden, all gardeners rejoice. They isolate the rose, tend it, foster it. But there is no gardener for men. This little Mozart will be shaped like the rest by the common stamping machine.... This little Mozart is condemned.\n> \n> — A Sense of Life: En Route to the U.S.S.R.\n> \n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The writer-aviator on Lac Saint-Louis during a speaking tour in support of France after its armistice with Germany. He started his work on the novella shortly after returning to the United States (Quebec, 1942).\nUpon the outbreak of the Second World War, a laureate of several of France's highest literary awards and a successful pioneering aviator prior to the war, Saint-Exupéry initially flew with a reconnaissance squadron as a reserve military pilot in the *Armée de l'Air* (French Air Force).[9] After France's defeat in 1940 and its armistice with Germany, he and Consuelo fled Occupied France and sojourned in North America, with Saint-Exupéry first arriving by himself at the very end of December 1940. His intention for the visit was to convince the United States to quickly enter the war against Nazi Germany and the Axis forces, and he soon became one of the expatriate voices of the French Resistance. In the midst of personal upheavals and failing health, he produced almost half of the writings for which he would be remembered, including a tender tale of loneliness, friendship, love and loss, in the form of a young prince visiting Earth.[45]\n\n\nAn earlier memoir by the author recounted his aviation experiences in the Sahara, and he is thought to have drawn on the same experiences as plot elements in *The Little Prince*.\n\n\nHe wrote and illustrated the manuscript during the summer and fall of 1942. Although greeted warmly by French-speaking Americans and by fellow expatriates who had preceded him in New York, his 27-month stay would be marred by health problems and racked with periods of severe stress, martial and marital strife. These included partisan attacks on the author's neutral stance towards supporters of both ardent French Gaullist and Vichy France.[46] Saint-Exupéry's American translator (the author spoke poor English) wrote: \"He was restless and unhappy in exile, seeing no way to fight again for his country and refusing to take part in the political quarrels that set Frenchman against Frenchman.\"[22] However, the period was to be both a \"dark but productive time\" during which he created three important works.[47]\n\n\nBetween January 1941 and April 1943, the Saint-Exupérys lived in two penthouse apartments on Central Park South,[48] then the Bevin House mansion in Asharoken, New York, and still later at a rented house on Beekman Place in New York City.[49][50]\n\n\nThe couple also stayed in Quebec for five weeks during the late spring of 1942, where they met a precocious eight-year-old boy with blond curly hair, Thomas, the son of philosopher Charles De Koninck, with whom the Saint-Exupérys resided.[51][52][53][54] During an earlier visit to Long Island in August 1939, Saint-Exupéry had also met Land Morrow Lindbergh, the young, golden-haired son of the pioneering American aviator Charles Lindbergh and his wife, Anne Morrow Lindbergh.[40][41]\n\n\nAfter returning to the US from his Quebec speaking tour, Saint-Exupéry was pressed to work on a children's book by Elizabeth Reynal, one of the wives of his US publisher, Reynal & Hitchcock. The French wife of Eugene Reynal had closely observed Saint-Exupéry for several months, and noting his ill health and high stress levels, she suggested to him that working on a children's story would help.[55][Note 5] The author wrote and illustrated *The Little Prince* at various locations in New York City but principally in the Long Island north-shore community of Asharoken in mid-to-late 1942, with the manuscript being completed in October.[50][51][51]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Bevin House on Long Island, one of the locations in which *The Little Prince* was written during the summer and fall of 1942.[50]\nAlthough the book was started in his Central Park South penthouse, Saint-Exupéry soon found New York City's noise and sweltering summer heat too uncomfortable to work in and so Consuelo was dispatched to find improved accommodations. After spending some time at an unsuitable clapboard country house in Westport, Connecticut,[56] they found Bevin House, a 22-room mansion in Asharoken that overlooked Long Island Sound. The author-aviator initially complained, \"I wanted a hut, and it's the Palace of Versailles.\"[45] As the weeks wore on, the author became invested in his project and the home would become \"a haven for writing, the best place I have ever had anywhere in my life.\"[57] He devoted himself to the book on mostly midnight shifts,[22] usually starting at about 11 pm, fueled by helpings of scrambled eggs on English muffins, gin and tonics, Coca-Colas, cigarettes and numerous visits by friends and expatriates who dropped in to see their famous countryman. One of the visitors was his wife's Swiss writer paramour Denis de Rougemont, who also modeled for a painting of the Little Prince lying on his stomach, feet and arms extended up in the air.[45][50] De Rougemont would later help Consuelo write her autobiography, *The Tale of the Rose*, as well as write his own biography of Saint-Exupéry.\n\n\nWhile the author's personal life was frequently chaotic, his creative process while writing was disciplined. Christine Nelson, curator of literary and historical manuscripts at the Morgan Library and Museum which had obtained Saint-Exupéry's original manuscript in 1968, stated: \"On the one hand, he had a clear vision for the shape, tone, and message of the story. On the other hand, he was ruthless about chopping out entire passages that just weren't quite right\", eventually distilling the 30,000 word manuscript, accompanied by small illustrations and sketches, to approximately half its original length.[58] The story, the curator added, was created when he was \"an ex-patriate and distraught about what was going on in his country and in the world.\"[14]\n\n\nThe large white Second French Empire-style mansion, hidden behind tall trees, afforded the writer a multitude of work environments, but he usually wrote at a large dining table.[22] It also allowed him to alternately work on his writings and then on his sketches and watercolours for hours at a time, moving his armchair and paint easel from the library towards the parlor one room at a time in search of sunlight. His meditative view of sunsets at the Bevin House were incorporated in the book, where the prince visits a small planet with 43 daily sunsets, a planet where all that is needed to watch a sunset \"is move your chair a few steps.\"[45][50][Note 6]\n\n\n\n### Manuscript[edit]\n\n\nThe original 140-page autograph manuscript of *The Little Prince*, along with various drafts and trial drawings, were acquired from the author's close friend Silvia Hamilton in 1968 by curator Herbert Cahoon of the Pierpont Morgan Library (now The Morgan Library & Museum) in Manhattan, New York City.[11][59][60] It is the only known surviving handwritten draft of the complete work.[61] The manuscript's pages include large amounts of the author's prose that was struck-through and therefore not published as part of the first edition. In addition to the manuscript, several watercolour illustrations by the author are also held by the museum. They were not part of the first edition. The institution has marked both the 50th and 70th anniversaries of the novella's publication, along with the centenary celebration of the author's birth, with major exhibitions of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry's literary works.[33][62] Physically, the manuscript's onion skin media has become brittle and subject to damage. Saint-Exupéry's handwriting is described as being doctor-like, verging on indecipherable.[63]\n\n\nThe story's keynote aphorism, *On ne voit bien qu'avec le cœur. L'essentiel est invisible pour les yeux* (\"One sees clearly only with the heart. What is essential is invisible to the eye\") was reworded and rewritten some 15 times before achieving its final phrasing. Saint-Exupéry also used a Dictaphone recorder to produce oral drafts for his typist.[22][59] His initial 30,000-word working manuscript was distilled to less than half its original size through laborious editing sessions. Multiple versions of its many pages were created and its prose then polished over several drafts, with the author occasionally telephoning friends at 2:00 a.m. to solicit opinions on his newly written passages.[22]\n\n\nMany pages and illustrations were cut from the finished work as he sought to maintain a sense of ambiguity to the story's theme and messages. Included among the deletions in its 17th chapter were references to locales in New York, such as the Rockefeller Center and Long Island. Other deleted pages described the prince's vegetarian diet and the garden on his home asteroid that included beans, radishes, potatoes and tomatoes, but which lacked fruit trees that might have overwhelmed the prince's planetoid. Deleted chapters discussed visits to other asteroids occupied by a retailer brimming with marketing phrases, and an inventor whose creation could produce any object desired at a touch of its controls. Likely the result of the ongoing war in Europe weighing on Saint-Exupéry's shoulders, the author produced a sombre three-page epilogue lamenting \"On one star someone has lost a friend, on another someone is ill, on another someone is at war...\", with the story's pilot-narrator noting of The Prince: \"he sees all that. . . . For him, the night is hopeless. And for me, his friend, the night is also hopeless.\" The draft epilogue was also omitted from the novella's printing.[59]\n\n\n\nFurther information:  Morgan exhibitions\n\nIn April 2012 a Parisian auction house announced the discovery of two previously unknown draft manuscript pages that included new text.[10][64] In the newly discovered material the Prince meets his first Earthling after his arrival. The person he meets is an \"ambassador of the human spirit\".[10][64] The ambassador is too busy to talk, saying he is searching for a missing six letter word: \"I am looking for a six-letter word that starts with G that means 'gargling' \", he says. Saint-Exupéry's text does not say what the word is, but experts believe it could be \"guerre\" (or \"war\"). The novella thus takes a more politicized tack with an anti-war sentiment, as 'to gargle' in French is an informal reference to 'honour', which the author may have viewed as a key factor in military confrontations between nations.[64][65]\n\n\n\n### Dedication[edit]\n\n\nSaint-Exupéry met Léon Werth (1878–1955), a writer and art critic, in 1931. Werth soon became Saint-Exupery's closest friend outside of his Aeropostale associates. Werth was an anarchist, a leftist Bolshevik supporter of Jewish descent, twenty-two years older than Saint-Exupéry.\n\n\n\nSaint-Exupéry dedicated two books to him, *Lettre à un otage [fr]* (*Letter to a Hostage*) and *Le Petit Prince* (*The Little Prince*), and referred to Werth in three more of his works. At the beginning of the Second World War while writing *The Little Prince*, Saint-Exupéry lived in his downtown New York City apartment, thinking of his native France and his friends. Werth spent the war unobtrusively in Saint-Amour, his village in the Jura, a mountainous region near Switzerland where he was \"alone, cold and hungry\", a place that had few polite words for French refugees. Werth appears in the preamble to the novella, where Saint-Exupéry dedicates the book to him:[66]\n\n\n> \n> To Leon Werth\n> \n> \n> I ask children to forgive me for dedicating this book to a grown-up. I have a serious excuse: this grown-up is the best friend I have in the world. I have another excuse: this grown-up can understand everything, even books for children. I have a third excuse: he lives in France where he is hungry and cold. He needs to be comforted. If all these excuses are not enough then I want to dedicate this book to the child whom this grown-up once was. All grown-ups were children first. (But few of them remember it.) So I correct my dedication:\n> \n> \n> To Leon Werth,  \n> \n> \n> \n> \n> When he was a little boy\n> \n> \n\n\nSaint-Exupéry's aircraft disappeared over the Mediterranean in July 1944. The following month, Werth learned of his friend's disappearance from a radio broadcast. Without having yet heard of *The Little Prince*, in November, Werth discovered that Saint-Exupéry had published a fable the previous year in the U.S., which he had illustrated himself, and that it was dedicated to him.[67] At the end of the Second World War, which Antoine de Saint-Exupéry did not live to see, Werth said: \"Peace, without Tonio (Saint-Exupéry) isn't entirely peace.\" Werth did not see the text for which he was so responsible until five months after his friend's death, when Saint-Exupéry's French publisher, Gallimard, sent him a special edition. Werth died in Paris in 1955.\n\n\n\n### Illustrations[edit]\n\n\nAll of the novella's simple but elegant watercolour illustrations, which were integral to the story, were painted by Saint-Exupéry. He had studied architecture as a young adult but nevertheless could not be considered an artist – which he self-mockingly alluded to in the novella's introduction. Several of his illustrations were painted on the wrong side of the delicate onion skin paper that he used, his medium of choice.[50] As with some of his draft manuscripts, he occasionally gave away preliminary sketches to close friends and colleagues; others were even recovered as crumpled balls from the floors in the cockpits he flew.[Note 7] Two or three original *Little Prince* drawings were reported in the collections of New York artist, sculptor and experimental filmmaker Joseph Cornell.[68] One rare original *Little Prince* watercolour would be mysteriously sold at a second-hand book fair in Japan in 1994, and subsequently authenticated in 2007.[69][70]\n\n\nAn unrepentant lifelong doodler and sketcher, Saint-Exupéry had for many years sketched little people on his napkins, tablecloths, letters to paramours and friends, lined notebooks and other scraps of paper.[43][45] Early figures took on a multitude of appearances, engaged in a variety of tasks. Some appeared as doll-like figures, baby puffins, angels with wings, and even a figure similar to that in Robert Crumb's *Keep On Truckin'* of 1968. In a 1940 letter to a friend, he sketched a character with his own thinning hair, sporting a bow tie, viewed as a boyish alter-ego, and he later gave a similar doodle to Elizabeth Reynal at his New York publisher's office.[43] Most often the diminutive figure was expressed as \"...a slip of a boy with a turned up nose, lots of hair, long baggy pants that were too short for him and with a long scarf that whipped in the wind. Usually the boy had a puzzled expression... [T]his boy Saint-Exupéry came to think of as \"the little prince\", and he was usually found standing on top of a tiny planet. Most of the time he was alone, sometimes walking up a path. Sometimes there was a single flower on the planet.\"[56] His characters were frequently seen chasing butterflies; when asked why they did so, Saint-Exupéry, who thought of the figures as his alter-egos, replied that they were actually pursuing a \"realistic ideal\".[45] Saint-Exupéry eventually settled on the image of the young, precocious child with curly blond hair, an image which would become the subject of speculations as to its source. One \"most striking\" illustration depicted the pilot-narrator asleep beside his stranded plane prior to the prince's arrival. Although images of the narrator were created for the story, none survived Saint-Exupéry's editing process.[14]\n\n\nTo mark both the 50th and 70th anniversaries of *The Little Prince's* publication, the Morgan Library and Museum mounted major exhibitions of Saint-Exupéry's draft manuscript, preparatory drawings, and similar materials that it had obtained earlier from a variety of sources. One major source was an intimate friend of his in New York City, Silvia Hamilton (later, Reinhardt), to whom the author gave his working manuscript just prior to returning to Algiers to resume his work as a Free French Air Force pilot.[33][62][71] Hamilton's black poodle, Mocha, is believed to have been the model for the Little Prince's sheep, with a Raggedy Ann type doll helping as a stand-in for the prince.[61] Additionally, a pet boxer, Hannibal, that Hamilton gave to him as a gift may have been the model for the story's desert fox and its tiger.[47] A museum representative stated that the novella's final drawings were lost.[33]\n\n\nSeven unpublished drawings for the book were also displayed at the museum's exhibit, including fearsome looking baobab trees ready to destroy the prince's home asteroid, as well as a picture of the story's narrator, the forlorn pilot, sleeping next to his aircraft. That image was likely omitted to avoid giving the story a 'literalness' that would distract its readers, according to one of the Morgan Library's staff.[33] According to Christine Nelson, curator of literary and historical manuscripts at the Morgan, \"[t]he image evokes Saint-Exupéry's own experience of awakening in an isolated, mysterious place. You can almost imagine him wandering without much food and water and conjuring up the character of the Little Prince.\"[14] Another reviewer noted that the author \"chose the best illustrations... to maintain the ethereal tone he wanted his story to exude. Choosing between ambiguity and literal text and illustrations, Saint-Exupéry chose in every case to obfuscate.\"[72] Not a single drawing of the story's narrator–pilot survived the author's editing process; \"he was very good at excising what was not essential to his story\".[14]\n\n\nIn 2001 Japanese researcher Yoshitsugu Kunugiyama surmised that the cover illustration Saint-Exupéry painted for *Le Petit Prince* deliberately depicted a stellar arrangement created to celebrate the author's own centennial of birth. According to Kunugiyama, the cover art chosen from one of Saint-Exupéry's watercolour illustrations contained the planets Saturn and Jupiter, plus the star Aldebaran, arranged as an isosceles triangle, a celestial configuration which occurred in the early 1940s, and which he likely knew would next reoccur in the year 2000.[73] Saint-Exupéry possessed superior mathematical skills and was a master celestial navigator, a vocation he had studied at Salon-de-Provence with the *Armée de l'Air* (French Air Force).\n\n\n\n### Post-publication[edit]\n\n\nStacy Schiff, one of Saint-Exupéry's principal biographers, wrote of him and his most famous work, \"rarely have an author and a character been so intimately bound together as Antoine de Saint-Exupéry and his Little Prince\", and remarking of their dual fates, \"the two remain tangled together, twin innocents who fell from the sky\".[74] Another noted that the novella's mystique was \"enhanced by the parallel between author and subject: imperious innocents whose lives consist of equal parts flight and failed love, who fall to earth, are little impressed with what they find here and ultimately disappear without a trace.\"[75]\n\n\nOnly weeks after his novella was first published in April 1943, despite his wife's pleadings and before Saint-Exupéry had received any of its royalties (he never would), the author-aviator joined the Free French Forces. He would remain immensely proud of *The Little Prince*, and almost always kept a personal copy with him which he often read to others during the war.[74]\n\n\n\nFurther information:  Antoine de Saint-Exupéry – Disappearance\n\nAs part of a 32-ship military convoy he voyaged to North Africa where he rejoined his old squadron to fight with the Allies, resuming his work as a reconnaissance pilot despite the best efforts of his friends, colleagues and fellow airmen who could not prevent him from flying.[Note 8] He had previously escaped death by the barest of margins a number of times, but was then lost in action during a July 1944 spy mission from the moonscapes of Corsica to the continent in preparation for the Allied invasion of occupied France, only three weeks before the Liberation of Paris.[45][Note 9]\n\n\n\n### Reception[edit]\n\n\nMany of the book's initial reviewers were flummoxed by the fable's multi-layered story line and its morals,[9] perhaps expecting a significantly more conventional story from one of France's leading writers. Its publisher had anticipated such reactions to a work that fell neither exclusively into a children's nor adults' literature classification. *The New York Times* reviewer wrote shortly before its publication \"What makes a good children's book? ... *The Little Prince*, which is a fascinating fable for grown-ups [is] of conjectural value for boys and girls of 6, 8 and 10. [It] may very well be a book on the order of *Gulliver's Travels*, something that exists on two levels\"; \"Can you clutter up a narrative with paradox and irony and still hold the interest of 8 and 10-year olds?\" Notwithstanding the story's duality, the review added that major portions of the story would probably still \"capture the imagination of any child.\"[78] Addressing whether it was written for children or adults, Reynal & Hitchcock promoted it ambiguously, saying that as far as they were concerned \"it's the new book by Saint-Exupéry\", adding to its dustcover \"There are few stories which in some way, in some degree, change the world forever for their readers. This is one.\"[59]\n\n\nOthers were not shy in offering their praise. Austin Stevens, also of *The New York Times*, stated that the story possessed \"...large portions of the Saint-Exupéry philosophy and poetic spirit. In a way it's a sort of credo.\"[56] P.L. Travers, author of the Mary Poppins series of children books, wrote in a *New York Herald Tribune* review: \"*The Little Prince* will shine upon children with a sidewise gleam. It will strike them in some place that is not the mind and glow there until the time comes for them to comprehend it.\"[59][79]\n\n\nBritish journalist Neil Clark, in *The American Conservative* in 2009, offered an expansive view of Saint-Exupéry's overall work by commenting that it provides a \"…bird's eye view of humanity [and] contains some of the most profound observations on the human condition ever written\", and that the author's novella \"doesn't merely express his contempt for selfishness and materialism [but] shows how life should be lived.\"[80]\n\n\nThe book enjoyed modest initial success, residing on *The New York Times* Best Seller list for only two weeks,[63] as opposed to his earlier 1939 English translation, *Wind, Sand and Stars* which remained on the same list for nearly five months.[43] As a cultural icon, the novella regularly draws new readers and reviewers, selling almost two million copies annually and also spawning numerous adaptations. Modern-day references to *The Little Prince* include one from *The New York Times* that describes it as \"abstract\" and \"fabulistic\".[62]\n\n\n\n## Literary translations and printed editions[edit]\n\n\nSee also: The Little Prince § Translations\n\n![](image)Two editions of *The Little Prince* (lower left in French and upper right in English, artwork not shown) in the Saint-Exupéry permanent exhibit at the French Air and Space Museum, Le Bourget, Paris (2008)\n![](image)Some of the more than 250 translations of *The Little Prince*, these editions displayed at the National Museum of Ethnology, Osaka, Japan (2013)\nAs of April 2017,[81] *The Little Prince* became the world's most translated non-religious book (into 300 languages) together with Italian novel *The Adventures of Pinocchio*.\n\n\nKatherine Woods (1886–1968)[82] produced the first English translation of 1943, which was later joined by several other English translations. Her translation contained some errors.[83][84] Mistranslations aside, one reviewer noted that Wood's almost \"poetic\" English translation has long been admired by many *Little Prince* lovers, who have spanned generations (it stayed in print until 2001), as her work maintains Saint-Exupéry's story-telling spirit and charm, if not its literal accuracy.[72] As of 2019[update] at least seven additional English translations have been published:[85]\n\n\n\n* Irene Testot-Ferry, (ISBN 0-7567-5189-6, 1st ed. 1995)\n* T.V.F.

As of 2017, it has been translated into more than 300 languages and dialects, including Sardinian,[90] the constructed international languages of Esperanto and Klingon, and the Congolese language Alur, as well as being printed in Braille for blind readers. It is also often used as an introduction into endangered varieties with very few speakers like Maya (2001), Aromanian (2006) or Banat Bulgarian (2017). It is one of the few modern books to have been translated into Latin, as *Regulus, vel Pueri soli sapiunt*[91][92] in 1961 by Auguste Haury (1910–2002) and as *Regulus* in 2010 by Alexander Winkler. In 2005, the book was also translated into Toba Qom, an indigenous language of northern Argentina, as *So Shiyaxauolec Nta'a*. It was the first book translated into that language since the New Testament. It was also translated to a northern Italian dialect, Vogherese. Anthropologist Florence Tola, commenting on the suitability of the work for Toban translation, said there is \"nothing strange [when] the Little Prince speaks with a snake or a fox and travels among the stars, it fits perfectly into the Toba mythology\".[93]\n\n\nLinguists have compared the many translations and even editions of the same translation for style, composition, titles, wordings and genealogy. As an example: as of 2011 there are approximately 47 translated editions of *The Little Prince* in Korean,[Note 10] and there are also about 50 different translated editions in Chinese (produced in both mainland China and Taiwan). Many of them are titled *Prince From a Star*, while others carry the book title that is a direct translation of *The Little Prince*.[95] By studying the use of word phrasings, nouns, mistranslations and other content in newer editions, linguists can identify the source material for each version: whether it was derived from the original French typescript, or from its first translation into English by Katherine Woods, or from a number of adapted sources.[72][96]\n\n\nThe first edition to be published in France, Saint-Exupéry's birthplace, was printed by his regular publisher in that country, Gallimard, only after[8] the German occupation of France ended.[97][Note 11] Prior to France's liberation new printings of Saint-Exupéry's works were made available only by means of secret print runs,[99][100] such as that of February 1943 when 1,000 copies of an underground version of his best seller *Pilote de guerre*, describing the German invasion of France, were covertly printed in Lyon.[101]\n\n\nCommemorating the novella's 70th anniversary of publication, in conjunction with the 2014 Morgan Exhibition, Éditions Gallimard released a complete facsimile edition of Saint-Exupéry's original handwritten manuscript entitled *Le Manuscrit du Petit Prince d'Antoine de Saint-Exupéry: Facsimilé et Transcription*, edited by Alban Cerisier and Delphine Lacroix. The book in its final form has also been republished in 70th anniversary editions by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (in English) and by Gallimard (in French).[61]\n\n\nA Portuguese translation of the novella in 2007, edited by Eidouro Gráfica e Editora Ltda and presented at the XIII Biannual Book Fair of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, holds the Guinness World Record for world's largest book published.[102] The impressive tome measures 2.01 m (6 ft 7 in) high and 3.08 m (10 ft 1 in) wide when open, containing 128 pages.\n\n\nIt has been translated into minority languages, such as the Irish language, by Éabhloid publishers in 2015.\n\n\n\n### Spanish editions[edit]\n\n\nAfter being translated by Bonifacio del Carril, *The Little Prince* was first published in Spanish as *El principito* in September 1951 by the Argentine publisher Emecé Editores.[103][104] Other Spanish editions have also been created; in 1956 the Mexican publisher Diana released its first edition of the book, *El pequeño príncipe*, a Spanish translation by José María Francés.[8] Another edition of the work was produced in Spain in 1964 and, four years later, in 1968, editions were also produced in Colombia and Cuba, with translation by Luis Fernández in 1961. Chile had its first translation in 1981; Peru in February 1985; Venezuela in 1986, and Uruguay in 1990.[103][105][106]\nThe book is among the few books in the Castilian cant Gacería[107] (as *El pitoche engrullón*) or the Madrid slang Cheli[108] (as *El chaval principeras*).\n\n\n\n### Bavarian editions[edit]\n\n\n*The Little Prince* has an adaptation for the inhabitants of Bavaria, Austria and South Tyrol, covering for a large variety of the Bavarian language. The book was adapted by Johannes Limmer and published in 2019. It is called *Da gloane Prinz* and contains the original pictures of Saint-Exupéry.[109]\n\n\n\n### Chinese editions[edit]\n\n\n*The Little Prince* is one of the most popular and beloved foreign works of literature in China. It is reported that there are more than 70 Chinese translations of the novella.[110] According to the official website of the Succession Antoine de Saint-Exupéry-d'Agay, the version translated by Li Jihong, which was published in January 2013, sold over two million copies in less than four years.[111] Cheng Li-chun published a translation in Taiwan in May 2022.[112]\n\n\n\n### Extension of copyrights in France[edit]\n\n\nDue to Saint-Exupéry's wartime death, his estate received the civil code designation *Mort pour la France* (English: *Died for France*), which was applied by the French government in 1948. Amongst the law's provisions is an increase of 30 years in the duration of copyright;[113] thus most of Saint-Exupéry's creative works will not fall out of copyright status in France for an extra 30 years.[114][75] So the original French text was in copyright almost everywhere in the world until 1 January 2015, remains under copyright in the US until 2039[115][116] and will remain in copyright in France until 2032.[117] EU law on copyright, however, fluctuates country by country, despite years of attempts to harmonize it at 70 years. French law allows for a copyright of 70 years from the author's death. Saint-Exupery, because of extraordinary service to his nation, is granted an additional 30 years, meaning, in France, Le Petit Prince does not actually fall out of copyright until the end of 2044.[*contradictory*]\n\n\n\n## Adaptations and sequels[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A short 45 RPM demo recording by Richard Burton narrating *The Little Prince* with music by Mort Garson, excerpted from a longer 33⅓ RPM vinyl record album.

Additionally, the title character himself has been adapted in a number of promotional roles, including as a symbol of environmental protection, by the Toshiba Group.[118] He has also been portrayed as a \"virtual ambassador\" in a campaign against smoking, employed by the Veolia Energy Services Group,[118] and his name was used as an episode title in the TV series *Lost*.\n\n\nThe multi-layered fable, styled as a children's story with its philosophical elements of irony and paradox directed towards adults, allowed *The Little Prince* to be transferred into various other art forms and media, including:\n\n\n\n* Vinyl record, cassette and CD: as early as 1954 several audio editions in multiple languages were created on vinyl record, cassette tape and much later as a CD, with one English version narrated by Richard Burton.\n* Radio broadcasts: radio plays were produced in the United States, with Raymond Burr, in 1956, and most recently in the United Kingdom on BBC in a 1999 dramatization by Bonnie Greer, produced by Pam Fraser Solomon.[119]\n* Film and TV: the story has been created as a movie as early as 1966 in a Soviet-Lithuanian production, with its first English movie version in 1974 produced in the United States featuring Bob Fosse, who choreographed his own dance sequence as \"The Snake\", and Gene Wilder as \"The Fox\". In 1987, a Turkish version was adopted into a direct-to-video film by Remzi Aydin Jonturk. Starting in 2010, a three-season-long animated series was made that expanded upon the book. In 2015, a major new 3D film, combining computer animation and stop motion animation, was released as *The Little Prince* in English and *Le Petit Prince* in French.[120][121] In 2023, a 2D-animated series will be released.[122]\n* Stage: *The Little Prince's* popular appeal has lent itself to widespread dramatic adaptations in live stage productions at both the professional and amateur levels. It has become a staple of numerous stage companies, with dozens of productions created.\n* Graphic novel: a new printed version of the story in comic book form, by Joann Sfar in 2008, drew widespread notice.\n* Pop-Up Book: a new printed edition, using the original text (as translated by Richard Howard in 2000) and St. Exupery's original drawings as the basis for elaborate pop-up illustrations, was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (ISBN 978-0-547-26069-3, 1st ed. 2009).\n* Opera and ballet: several operatic and ballet versions of the novella have been produced as early as the Russian *Malen′kiy prints* by Lev Knipper, first performed in 1978 with a symphony score composed in the 1960s.\n* Concert music: Concert Suite on *Le Petit Prince* for solo violin, solo harp and chamber orchestra by Jean-Pascal Beintus (premiered by the DSO Berlin – Kent Nagano – 2008)\n\n\n![](image)One of numerous stage adaptations of Saint-Exupéry's child and adult fable, this one at the University of Minnesota's Rarig Center Proscenium (2010)\n* Anime: a Japanese animation TV series was made in 1978, *Hoshi no Ōjisama: Petit Prince*, containing 39 episodes that do not follow the plot of the original novella. Each episode contains an adventure on a planet, usually Earth, where the little prince meets different people each time and makes friends. Some key elements of the original story have been kept. Namely, the little prince's golden hair, his scarf, laughter, his planet name (B-612), the rose and the three volcanoes. The anime had been aired and dubbed into several languages including Arabic, English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Portuguese and Spanish. The English dub's title is *The Adventures of the Little Prince*.[123]\n* Other: a number of musical references, game boards and a video game version of the novella have been released.\n\n\nIn 1997, Jean-Pierre Davidts wrote what could be considered a sequel to *The Little Prince*, entitled *Le petit prince retrouvé* (*The Little Prince Returns*).[124] In this version, the shipwrecked narrator encounters the little prince on a lone island; the prince has returned to seek help against a tiger who threatens his sheep.[125] Another sequel titled *The Return of the Little Prince* was written by former actress Ysatis de Saint-Simone, niece of Consuelo de Saint-Exupéry.[126]\n\n\n\n## Honours and legacy[edit]\n\n\n### Museums and exhibits[edit]\n\n\n#### Morgan exhibitions[edit]\n\n\nNew York City's Morgan Library & Museum mounted three showings of the original manuscript, with its first showing in 1994, on the occasion of the story's 50th anniversary of publication, followed by one celebrating the author's centennial of birth in 2000, with its last and largest exhibition in 2014 honouring the novella's 70th anniversary.\n\n\nThe 1994 exhibition displayed the original manuscript, translated by the museum's art historian Ruth Kraemer,[127] as well as a number of the story's watercolours drawn from the Morgan's permanent collection. Also included with the exhibits was a 20-minute video it produced, *My Grown-Up Friend, Saint-Exupéry*, narrated by actor Macaulay Culkin,[Note 12] along with photos of the author, correspondence to Consuelo, a signed first edition of *The Little Prince*, and several international editions in other languages.[92]\n\n\nIn January 2014, the museum mounted a third, significantly larger, exhibition centered on the novella's creative origins and its history. The major showing of *The Little Prince: A New York Story* celebrated the story's 70th anniversary.[62] It examined both the novella's New York origins and Saint-Exupéry's creative processes, looking at his story and paintings as they evolved from conceptual germ form into progressively more refined versions and finally into the book's highly polished first edition. It was as if visitors were able to look over his shoulder as he worked, according to curator Christine Nelson. Funding for the 2014 exhibition was provided by several benefactors, including The Florence Gould Foundation, The Caroline Macomber Fund, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Air France and the New York State Council on the Arts.[61]\n\n\nThe new, more comprehensive exhibits included 35 watercolor paintings and 25 of the work's original 140 handwritten manuscript pages,[129] with his almost illegible handwriting penciled onto 'Fidelity' watermarked onion skin paper. The autograph manuscript pages included struck-through content that was not published in the novella's first edition. As well, some 43 preparatory pencil drawings that evolved into the story's illustrations accompanied the manuscript, many of them dampened by moisture that rippled its onion skin media.[130][131] One painting depicted the prince floating above Earth wearing a yellow scarf was wrinkled, having been crumpled up and thrown away before being retrieved for preservation.[47] Another drawing loaned from Silvia Hamilton's grandson depicted the diminutive prince observing a sunset on his home asteroid; two other versions of the same drawing were also displayed alongside it allowing visitors to observe the drawing's progressive refinement.[59] The initial working manuscript and sketches, displayed side by side with pages from the novella's first edition, allowed viewers to observe the evolution of Saint-Exupéry's work.\n\n\nShortly before departing the United States to rejoin his reconnaissance squadron in North Africa in its struggle against Nazi Germany, Saint-Exupéry appeared unexpectedly in military uniform at the door of his intimate friend, Silvia Hamilton. He presented his working manuscript and its preliminary drawings in a \"rumpled paper bag\", placed onto her home's entryway table, offering, \"I'd like to give you something splendid, but this is all I have\".[62][71][79][131][132] Several of the manuscript pages bore accidental coffee stains and cigarette scorch marks.[47] The Morgan later acquired the 30,000-word manuscript from Hamilton in 1968, with its pages becoming the centrepieces of its exhibitions on Saint-Exupéry's work. The 2014 exhibition also borrowed artifacts and the author's personal letters from the Saint-Exupéry-d'Gay Estate,[Note 13] as well as materials from other private collections, libraries and museums in the United States and France.[133] Running concurrent with its 2014 exhibition, the Morgan held a series of lectures, concerts and film showings, including talks by Saint-Exupéry biographer Stacy Schiff, writer Adam Gopnik, and author Peter Sís on his new work *The Pilot and The Little Prince: The Life of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry*,[132][134]\n\n\nAdditional exhibits included photos of Saint-Exupéry by *Life* photojournalist John Phillips, other photos of the author's New York area homes,[61] an Orson Welles screenplay of the novella the filmmaker attempted to produce as a movie in collaboration with Walt Disney,[43][62][Note 14] as well as one of the few signed copies extant of *The Little Prince*, gifted to Hamilton's 12-year-old son.[Note 15]\n\n\n\n#### Permanent exhibits[edit]\n\n\n* In Le Bourget, Paris, France, the Air and Space Museum of France established a special exhibit honoring Saint-Exupéry, and which displays many of his literary creations. Among them are various early editions of *The Little Prince*. Remnants of the Free French Air Force P-38 Lightning in which he disappeared, and which were recovered from the Mediterranean in 2004, are also on view.\n* In Hakone, Japan there is the Museum of The Little Prince featuring outdoor squares and sculptures such as the B-612 Asteroid, the Lamplighter Square, and a sculpture of the Little Prince. The museum grounds additionally feature a *Little Prince Park* along with the *Consuelo Rose Garden*; however the main portion of the museum are its indoor exhibits.\n* In Gyeonggi-do, South Korea, there is an imitation French village, Petite France, which has adapted the story elements of *The Little Prince* into its architecture and monuments. There are several sculptures of the story's characters, and the village also offers overnight housing in some of the French-style homes. Featured are the history of *The Little Prince*, an art gallery, and a small amphitheatre situated in the middle of the village for musicians and other performances. The enterprise's director stated that in 2009 the village received a half million visitors.[94][135][136]\n\n\n#### Special exhibitions[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)The Little Prince as part of a street art project in Funchal (Madeira)In 1996 the Danish sculptor Jens Galschiøt unveiled an artistic arrangement consisting of seven blocks of granite asteroids 'floating' in a circle around a 2-metre tall planet Earth. The artistic universe was populated by bronze sculpture figures that the little prince met on his journeys. As in the book, the prince discovers that \"the essential is invisible to the eye, and only by the heart can you really see\". The work was completed at the start of 1996 and placed in the central square of Fuglebjerg, Denmark,[137] but was later stolen from an exhibition in Billund in 2011.[138]\n* During 2009 in São Paulo, Brazil, the giant Oca Art Exhibition Centre presented The Little Prince as part of The Year of France and *The Little Prince*. The displays covered over 10,000 square metres on four floors, examining Saint-Exupéry, The Little Prince and their philosophies, as visitors passed through theme areas of the desert, different worlds, stars and the cosmos. The ground floor of the exhibit area was laid out as a huge map of the routes flown by the author and Aeropostale in South America and around the world. Also included was a full-scale replica of his Caudron Simoun, crashed in a simulated Sahara Desert.[139][140][141]\n* In 2012 the Catalan architect Jan Baca unveiled a sculpture in Terrassa, Catalonia showing the Little Prince along with the sentence, \"It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye\".[142]\n* In February 2022, nearly eight decades after it was written, \"The Little Prince\" arrived in Paris. The exhibit began on February 17 and ended on June 26. It contained 600 items, including photographs, poems, and newspaper clippings relating to \"The Little Prince.\"[143]\n\n\n### Places[edit]\n\n\n#### Playground[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sculpture of the lamplighter in a \"story playground\" themed after *The Little Prince* in Holon, Israel\n* One of the \"story playgrounds\" – a series of playgrounds themed after famous children's stories in Holon, Israel – is themed after *The Little Prince*. It features sculptures and play structures depicting scenes and characters from the book.\n\n\n#### Schools[edit]\n\n\n* *L'école Le Petit Prince* is the public elementary school in the small community of Genech in northern France, dedicated in 1994 upon the merger of two former schools. With nine classrooms and a library, its building overlooks the village's *Place Terre des Hommes*,[144] a square also named in tribute to Saint-Exupéry's 1939 philosophical memoir, *Terre des hommes*.\n* A K–6 elementary school on Avro Road in Maple, Ontario, Canada, was also opened in 1994 as *L'école élémentaire catholique Le Petit Prince*. Its enrollment expanded from 30 students in its first year to some 325 children by 2014. One of Saint-Exupéry's colourful paintings of the prince is found on its website's welcome page.[145]\n\n\n#### Avenue[edit]\n\n\n* In southern Brazil, in the city of Florianópolis, there is the *Avenida Pequeno Príncipe* (Little Prince Avenue in Portuguese), whose name is a tribute to Saint-Exupéry, who passed through the city during his aviator career, an event that became part of the local culture.[146]\n\n\n### Insignia and awards[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The fighter jet insignia of the GR I/33 [fr], bearing an image of the Little Prince at top\n* Prior to its decommissioning in 2010, the GR I/33 [fr] (later renamed as the 1/33 Belfort Squadron), one of the French Air Force squadrons Saint-Exupéry flew with, adopted the image of the *Little Prince* as part of the squadron and tail insignia of its Dassault Mirage fighter jets.[147] Some of the fastest jets in the world were flown with The Prince gazing over their pilots' shoulders.\n* *The Little Prince Literary Award* for Persian fiction by writers under the age of 15, commemorating the title of Saint-Exupéry's famous work, was created in Iran by the Cheragh-e Motale'eh Literary Foundation. In 2012, some 250 works by young authors were submitted for first stage review according to the society's secretary Maryam Sistani, with the selection of the best three writers from 30 finalists being conducted in Tehran that September.[148][149]\n* Several other Little Prince Awards have also been established in Europe, meant to promote achievement and excellence in a variety of fields such as in assistance to autistic children, child literacy, children's literature (by adults), Puppetry theatre and theatre arts.[150][151][152]\n\n\n### Numismatics and philatelic[edit]\n\n\n* Before France adopted the euro as its currency, Saint-Exupéry and drawings from *The Little Prince* were on the 50-franc banknote; the artwork was by Swiss designer Roger Pfund.[74][153] Among the anti-counterfeiting measures on the banknote was micro-printed text from *Le Petit Prince*, visible with a strong magnifying glass.[154] Additionally, a 100-franc commemorative coin was also released in 2000, with Saint-Exupéry's image on its obverse, and that of the Little Prince on its reverse.[155]\n* In commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the writer's untimely death, Israel issued a stamp honoring \"Saint-Ex\" and *The Little Prince* in 1994.[156] Philatelic tributes have been printed in at least 24 other countries as of 2011.[157]\n\n\n### Astronomy[edit]\n\n\n* The B612 Foundation is a private foundation created to track Near-Earth objects that might pose a threat to Earth, and is dedicated to protecting the planet from asteroid strikes, similar to the Tunguska event of 1908. The private foundation was founded by a group of U.S. scientists and astronauts, including Clark Chapman, Piet Hut, Rusty Schweickart and Ed Lu in October 2002. The non-profit organization is named in honour of the prince's home asteroid.[158]\n* An asteroid discovered in 1975, 2578 Saint-Exupéry, was also named after the author of *The Little Prince*.[159]\n* Another asteroid discovered in 1993 was named 46610 Bésixdouze, which is French for \"B six twelve\". The asteroid's number, 46610, becomes `B612` in hexadecimal notation. B-612 was the name of the prince's home asteroid.\n* In 2003 a small asteroid moon, Petit-Prince, discovered earlier in 1998, was named in part after *The Little Prince*.[160]\n\n\n### Professional wrestling[edit]\n\n\nFrench professional wrestler Daniel Dubail was billed as Le Petit Prince.[161]\nPakistani-British professional wrestler Mohammed Allam was billed as The Little Prince[162]\n\n\n\n### The Little Prince Day[edit]\n\n\nSince 2020, June 29 is International Little Prince Day. This date was chosen to commemorate the birth of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, which occurred on June 29, 1900. The Antoine de Saint-Exupéry Foundation started the initiative striving to promote the humanist values carried by the book published in 1943. Mark Osborne was one of the first personalities to participate in the Little Prince Day 2020.[163]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Children's literature portal\n* ![icon](image)Speculative fiction portal\n* ![icon](image)Novels portal\n* ![flag](image)France portal\n\n\n* List of *The Little Prince* adaptations, a listing of *The Little Prince* story adapted into various media.\n* *The Little Prince* (1974 film), a 1974 musical film directed by Stanley Donen\n* *The Little Prince* (play), a theatrical adaptation\n* *The Little Prince* (opera), an opera in two acts by Rachel Portman to an English libretto by Nicholas Wright\n* *The Adventures of The Little Prince* (TV series), an anime series\n* *The Little Prince and the Aviator*, a 1981 musical theatre adaptation\n* *Eloise at the Plaza*, a 2003 TV film in which many references to *The Little Prince* can be identified\n* *The Little Prince* (TV series), a 2010 TV series\n* *The Little Prince* (2015 film), a 2015 animated film directed by Mark Osborne\n* *Le Monde*'s 100 Books of the Century\n* *Invisible Essence: The Little Prince*, a 2018 documentary film about the book\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \n\nNote that although Saint-Exupéry's regular French publisher, Gallimard, lists *Le Petit Prince* as being published in 1946, that is apparently a legalistic interpretation possibly designed to allow for an extra year of the novella's copyright protection period, and is based on Gallimard's explanation that the book was only 'sold' starting in 1946. Other sources, such as LePetitPrince.com,[8] record the first Librairie Gallimard printing of 12,250 copies as occurring on 30 November 1945.\n2. **^** The Antoine de Saint-Exupéry Foundation estimates an additional 80 million copies of the story in audio-video formats have been sold worldwide.[13]\n3. **^** \n\nThe plane Saint-Exupéry was flying when he crashed at high speed in the Sahara was a Caudron C-630 Simoun, Serial Number 7042, with the French registration F-ANRY ('F' being the international designator for France, and the remainder chosen by the author to represent ANtoine de saint-exupéRY).\n4. **^** \n\nAccording to Hoffman, \"Anne Morrow Lindbergh's fascination with Saint-Ex was transparent in all she wrote about him, as might be expected when one aviator-writer romantic is writing about another.\" Saint-Exupéry visited with Anne for two days but spoke with Charles Lindbergh, who arrived home late, for an hour. Besides their vast differences on how Adolf Hitler and the European conflict should be treated, Charles did not speak French, and Saint-Exupéry did not speak English well. Their discussions, passed through Anne's meager French, were somewhat muted. However, the excited conversation between Antoine and Anne soon blossomed \"like monster flowers\", with each finishing the other's sentences. Ironically, while Saint-Exupéry would later campaign for an early US entry into the war, Lindbergh strongly opposed American involvement in the European war and wanted an arrangement with Hitler, like Stalin's. The meeting between the two future P-38 war pilots was termed \"less than a rousing success\". Moreover, Charles later became unhappy about his wife's vast esteem for the French adventurer.\"\n5. **^** Another source states that it was co-publisher Curtice Hitchcock who viewed the author sketches and doodles at a supper party one evening and then suggested writing a children's book to Saint-Exupéry.[56] An additional likely reason for the publisher's encouragement: P. L. Travers, the author of the popular children's books series on *Mary Poppins*, was at that time working on her third installment that would be published by a Reynal & Hitchcock competitor in 1943, the same year as *The Little Prince*. Saint-Exupéry's U.S. publisher pressed him to have a competing children's book on the market for Christmas 1942.\n6. **^** \n\nSaint-Exupéry was 43 the year the fable was published, and 44 the year he died. He originally wrote the story with 43 sunsets, but posthumous editions often quote '44 sunsets', possibly in tribute.\n7. **^** \n\nOn one of Saint-Exupéry's flights his aircraft engine started failing. His aircraft mechanic onboard later recalled that Saint-Exupéry was completely calm, \"Saint-Ex simply started doodling cartoons which he handed back to me with a big grin.\"[24]\n8. **^** \n\nFollowing one of his crashes in a sophisticated single-pilot spy aircraft that resulted in him being grounded, Saint-Exupéry spared no effort in his campaign to return to active combat flying duty. He utilized all his contacts and powers of persuasion to overcome his age and physical handicap barriers, which would have completely barred an ordinary patriot from serving as a war pilot. Instrumental in his reinstatement was an agreement he proposed to John Phillips, a fluently bilingual *Life Magazine* correspondent in February 1944, where Saint-Exupéry committed to \"write, and I'll donate what I do to you, for your publication, if you get me reinstated into my squadron.\"[76] Phillips later met with a high-level U.S. Army Air Forces press officer in Italy, Colonel John Reagan McCrary, who conveyed the *Life Magazine* request to General Eaker. Eaker's approval for Saint-Exupéry's return to flying status would be made \"not through favoritism, but through exception.\" The brutalized French, it was noted, would cut a German's throat \"probably with more relish than anybody.\"\n9. **^** \n\nVarious sources state that his final flight was either his seventh, eight, ninth, or even his tenth covert reconnaissance mission. He volunteered for almost every such proposed mission submitted to his squadron, and protested fiercely after being grounded following his second sortie which ended with a demolished P-38. His connections in high places, plus a publishing agreement with *Life Magazine*, were instrumental in having the grounding order against him lifted.[77] For some time Saint-Exupéry's friends, colleagues, and compatriots were actively working to keep the aging, accident-prone author grounded, out of harm's way.\n10. **^** \n\nIn 2009, the director of the *Village Petite France* (Little France Village) in South Korea stated that there were 350 different editions of *Orin Wanja* (The Little Prince) in Korean, including editions in Manga.[94]\n11. **^** A further complication occurred due to Saint-Exupéry's opinions of French General Charles de Gaulle, whom he held in low regard. Even though both men were working to free France from Nazi occupation, Saint-Exupéry saw de Gaulle with apprehension and consequently provided no public support to the General. In response, de Gaulle struck back at the author by implying that the author was a German supporter, and then had all his literary works banned in France's North African colonies. Saint-Exupéry's writings were, with irony, banned simultaneously in both occupied France and Free France.[98][74]\n12. **^** \n\nAlthough Macaulay Culkin had been earning approximately $8 million per film project at that point, he provided his narration to the museum \"for nothing, and we are grateful for his services\", according to a Morgan representative.[128]\n13. **^** The *d'Gay* portion of the estate refers to Saint-Exupéry's married sister.\n14. **^** \nOrson Welles purchased the movie rights to the story the day after reading the novella in a single sitting.[61] Welles was unable to persuade Walt Disney to assist him in turning his screenplay of the story into a film, with Disney fearing such a screen release would upstage his own screen adaptations of other stories.\n15. **^** \n\nThe signed copy is inscribed \"For Stephen, to whom I have already spoken about *The Little Prince*, and who perhaps will be his friend\".[58]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** de Saint-Exupéry & Woods 1943.\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** genome.ch.bbc.co.uk, accessed 9 October 2021\n3. **^** de Saint-Exupéry & Cuffe 2006.\n4. **^** de Saint-Exupéry & Morpurgo 2018.\n5. **^** de Saint-Exupéry & Testot-Ferry 2018.\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"'Definitive' Translation of 'Le Petit Prince'\", *New Straits Times*, 20 September 2000.

It was first published in English and French in the United States by Reynal & Hitchcock in April 1943 and was published posthumously in France following liberation; Saint-Exupéry's works had been banned by the Vichy Regime. The story follows a young prince who visits various planets, including Earth, and addresses themes of loneliness, friendship, love, and loss. Despite its style as a children's book, *The Little Prince* makes observations about life, adults, and human nature.[9]\n\n\n*The Little Prince* became Saint-Exupéry's most successful work, selling an estimated 140 million copies worldwide, which makes it one of the best-selling in history.[10][11][12][Note 2][14] The book has been translated into over 505 different languages and dialects worldwide, being the second most translated work ever published, trailing only the Bible.[15][16][17] *The Little Prince* has been adapted to numerous art forms and media, including audio recordings, radio plays, live stage, film, television, ballet, and opera.[16][18]\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nThe narrator begins with a discussion on the nature of grownups and their inability to perceive \"important things\". As a test to determine if a grownup is as enlightened as a child, he shows them a picture depicting a boa constrictor that has eaten an elephant. The grownups always reply that the picture depicts a hat, and so he knows to only talk of \"reasonable\" things to them, rather than the fanciful.\n\n\nThe narrator becomes an aircraft pilot, and one day, his plane crashes in the Sahara desert, far from civilization. The narrator has an eight-day supply of water and must fix his aeroplane. Here, he is greeted unexpectedly by a young boy nicknamed \"the little prince.\" The prince has golden hair, a loveable laugh, and will repeat questions until they are answered.\n\n\nThe prince asks the narrator to draw a sheep. The narrator first shows him the picture of the elephant inside the snake, which, to the narrator's surprise, the prince interprets correctly. After three failed attempts at drawing a sheep, the frustrated narrator draws a simple crate, claiming the sheep is inside. The prince exclaims that this was exactly the drawing he wanted.\n\n\nOver the course of eight days in the desert, while the narrator attempts to repair his plane, the prince recounts his life story. He begins describing his tiny home planet: in effect, a house-sized asteroid known as \"B 612\" on Earth. The asteroid's most prominent features are three minuscule volcanoes (two active, and one dormant or extinct) and a variety of plants.\n\n\nThe prince describes his earlier days cleaning the volcanoes and weeding unwanted seeds and sprigs that infest his planet's soil; in particular, pulling out baobab trees that are constantly on the verge of overrunning the surface. If the baobabs are not rooted out the moment they are recognised, their roots can have a catastrophic effect on the tiny planet. Therefore, the prince wants a sheep to eat the undesirable plants, but worries it will also eat plants with thorns.\n\n\nThe prince tells of his love for a vain and silly rose that began growing on the asteroid's surface some time ago. The rose is given to pretension, exaggerating ailments to gain attention and have the prince care for her. The prince says he nourished the rose and tended to her, making a screen and glass globe to protect her from the cold and wind, watering her, and keeping the caterpillars off.\n\n\nAlthough the prince fell in love with the rose, he also began to feel that she was taking advantage of him, and he resolved to leave the planet to explore the rest of the universe. Upon their goodbyes, the rose apologises for failing to show that she loved him. She wishes him well and turns down his desire to leave her in the glass globe, saying she will protect herself. The prince laments that he did not understand how to love his rose while he was with her and should have listened to her kind actions, rather than her vain words.\n\n\nThe prince has since visited six other planets, each of which was inhabited by a single, irrational, narrow-minded adult, each meant to critique an element of society. They include:\n\n\n\n* A king with no subjects, who only issues orders that will be followed, such as commanding the sun to set at sunset.\n* A conceited man who only wants the praise which comes from admiration and being the most admirable person on his otherwise uninhabited planet.\n* A drunkard who drinks to forget the shame of drinking.\n* A businessman who is blind to the beauty of the stars and instead endlessly counts and catalogues them in order to \"own\" them all (critiquing materialism).\n* A lamplighter on a planet so small, a full day lasts a minute. He wastes his life blindly following orders to extinguish and relight the lamppost every 30 seconds to correspond with his planet's day and night.\n* An elderly geographer who has never been anywhere, or seen any of the things he records, providing a caricature of specialisation in the contemporary world.\n\n\nIt is the geographer who tells the prince that his rose is an ephemeral being, which is not recorded, and recommends that the prince next visit the planet Earth. The visit to Earth begins with a deeply pessimistic appraisal of humanity. The six absurd people the prince encountered earlier comprise, according to the narrator, just about the entire adult world. On earth there were:\n\n\n\n\n> 111 kings ... 7,000 geographers, 900,000 businessmen, 7,500,000 tipplers, 311,000,000 conceited men; that is to say, about 2,000,000,000 grown-ups.\n> \n> \n\n\nSince the prince landed in a desert, he believed that Earth was uninhabited. He then met a yellow snake that claimed to have the power to return him to his home, if he ever wished to return. The prince next met a desert flower, who told him that she had only seen a handful of men in this part of the world and that they had no roots, letting the wind blow them around and living hard lives. After climbing the highest mountain he had ever seen, the prince hoped to see the whole of Earth, thus finding the people; however, he saw only the enormous, desolate landscape. When the prince called out, his echo answered him, which he interpreted as the voice of a boring person who only repeats what another says.\n\n\nThe prince encountered a whole row of rosebushes, becoming downcast at having once thought that his own rose was unique and thinking his rose had lied about being unique. He began to feel that he was not a great prince at all, as his planet contained only three tiny volcanoes and a flower that he now thought of as common. He laid down on the grass and wept, until a fox came along.\n\n\nThe fox desired to be tamed and taught the prince how to tame him. By being tamed, something goes from being ordinary and just like all the others to being special and unique. There are drawbacks since the connection can lead to sadness and longing when apart.\n\n\nFrom the fox, the prince learns that his rose was indeed unique and special because she was the object of the prince's love and time; he had \"tamed\" her, and now she was more precious than all of the roses he had seen in the garden. Upon their sad departing, the fox imparts a secret: important things can only be seen with the heart, not the eyes.\n\n\nThe prince finally met two people from Earth:\n\n\n\n* A railway switchman who told him how passengers constantly rushed from one place to another aboard trains, never satisfied with where they were and not knowing what they were after; only the children among them ever bothered to look out the windows.\n* A merchant who talked to the prince about his product, a pill that eliminated the need to drink for a week, saving people 53 minutes.\n\n\nBack in the present moment, it is the eighth day after the narrator's plane crash and the narrator and the prince are dying of thirst. The prince has become visibly morose and saddened over his recollections and longs to return home and see his flower.\n\n\nThe prince finds a well, saving them. The narrator later finds the prince talking to the snake, discussing his return home and his desire to see his rose again, who, he worries, has been left to fend for herself. The prince bids an emotional farewell to the narrator and states that if it looks as though he has died, it is only because his body was too heavy to take with him to his planet. The prince warns the narrator not to watch him leave, as it will upset him. The narrator, realising what will happen, refuses to leave the prince's side. The prince consoles the narrator by saying that he only need look at the stars to think of the prince's loveable laughter, and that it will seem as if all the stars are laughing. The prince then walks away from the narrator and allows the snake to bite him, soundlessly falling down.\n\n\nThe next morning, the narrator is unable to find the prince's body. He finally manages to repair his aeroplane and leave the desert. It is left up to the reader to determine if the prince returned home or died. The story ends with a drawing of the landscape where the prince and the narrator met and where the snake took the prince's corporeal life. The narrator requests to be immediately contacted by anyone in that area encountering a small person with golden curls who refuses to answer any questions.\n\n\n\n## Tone and writing style[edit]\n\n\nThe story of *The Little Prince* is recalled in a sombre, measured tone by the pilot-narrator, in memory of his small friend, \"a memorial to the prince—not just to the prince, but also to the time the prince and the narrator had together.\"[19] *The Little Prince* was created when Saint-Exupéry was \"an ex-patriate and distraught about what was going on in his country and in the world.\"[14] According to one analysis, \"the story of the Little Prince features a lot of fantastical, unrealistic elements.... You can't ride a flock of birds to another planet... The fantasy of the Little Prince works because the logic of the story is based on the imagination of children, rather than the strict realism of adults.\"[20]\n\n\nAn exquisite literary perfectionist, akin to the 19th century French poet Stéphane Mallarmé,[21] Saint-Exupéry produced draft pages \"covered with fine lines of handwriting, much of it painstakingly crossed out, with one word left standing where there were a hundred words, one sentence substitut[ing] for a page...\"[22] He worked \"long hours with great concentration.\" According to the author himself, it was extremely difficult to start his creative writing processes.[23] Biographer Paul Webster wrote of the aviator-author's style: \"Behind Saint-Exupéry's quest for perfection was a laborious process of editing and rewriting which reduced original drafts by as much as two-thirds.\"[24] The French author frequently wrote at night, usually starting at about 11 p.m. accompanied by a tray of strong black coffee. In 1942 Saint-Exupéry related to his American English teacher, Adèle Breaux, that at such a time of night he felt \"free\" and able to concentrate, \"writing for hours without feeling tired or sleepy\", until he instantaneously dozed off.[22] He would wake up later, in daylight, still at his desk, with his head on his arms. Saint-Exupéry stated it was the only way he could work, as once he started a writing project it became an obsession.[25]\n\n\nWhile Saint-Exupéry was a native speaker of French, he was never able to achieve anything more than haltingly poor English. Adèle Breaux, his young Northport English tutor to whom he later dedicated a writing (\"For Miss Adèle Breaux, who so gently guided me in the mysteries of the English language\"), related her experiences with her famous student as *Saint-Exupéry in America, 1942–1943: A Memoir*, published in 1971.[26]\n\n\n\"Saint-Exupéry's prodigious writings and studies of literature sometimes gripped him, and on occasion he continued his readings of literary works until moments before take-off on solitary military reconnaissance flights, as he was adept at both reading and writing while flying. Taking off with an open book balanced on his leg, his ground crew would fear his mission would quickly end after contacting something 'very hard'. On one flight, to the chagrin of colleagues awaiting his arrival, he circled the Tunis airport for an hour so that he could finish reading a novel. Saint-Exupéry frequently flew with a lined *carnet* (notebook) during his long, solo flights, and some of his philosophical writings were created during such periods when he could reflect on the world below him, becoming 'enmeshed in a search for ideals which he translated into fable and parable'.\"[27][28]\n\n\n\n## Inspirations[edit]\n\n\n### Events and characters[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Saint-Exupéry next to his downed Simoun (lacking an all-critical radio) after crashing into the Sahara about 3 am during an air race to Saigon, Vietnam. His survival ordeal was about to begin (Egypt, 1935).\nIn *The Little Prince*, its narrator, the pilot, talks of being stranded in the desert beside his crashed aircraft. The account clearly drew on Saint-Exupéry's own experience in the Sahara, an ordeal described in detail in his 1939 memoir *Wind, Sand and Stars* (original French: *Terre des hommes*).[9]\n\n\nOn 30 December 1935, at 2.45am, after 19 hours and 44 minutes in the air, Saint-Exupéry, along with his copilot-navigator André Prévot, crashed in the Sahara desert.[29] They were attempting to break the speed record for a Paris-to-Saigon flight in a then-popular type of air race called a *raid*, that had a prize of 150,000 francs.[30] Their plane was a Caudron C-630 Simoun,[Note 3] and the crash site is thought to have been near to the Wadi Natrun valley, close to the Nile Delta.[31]\n\n\nBoth miraculously survived the crash, only to face rapid dehydration in the intense desert heat.[32] Their maps were primitive and ambiguous. Lost among the sand dunes with a few grapes, a thermos of coffee, a single orange, and some wine, the pair had only one day's worth of liquid. They both began to see mirages, which were quickly followed by more vivid hallucinations. By the second and third days, they were so dehydrated that they stopped sweating altogether. Finally, on the fourth day, a Bedouin on a camel discovered them and administered a native rehydration treatment, which saved Saint-Exupéry's and Prévot's lives.[30]\n\n\nIn the novella, the fox, believed to be modelled after the author's intimate New York City friend, Silvia Hamilton Reinhardt, tells the prince that his rose is unique and special, as she is the one he loves.[33] The novella's iconic phrase, \"One sees clearly only with the heart\" is believed to have been suggested by Reinhardt.\n\n\nThe fearsome, grasping baobab trees, researchers have contended, were meant to represent Nazism attempting to destroy the planet.[33] The little prince's reassurance to the pilot that the prince's body is only an empty shell resembles the last words of Antoine's dying younger brother François, who told the author, from his deathbed: \"Don't worry. I'm all right. I can't help it. It's my body\".[34]\n\n\n\n### Rose[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Rose in *The Little Prince* was likely inspired by Saint-Exupéry's Salvadoran wife, Consuelo (Montreal, 1942)\nMany researchers believe that the prince's kindhearted, but petulant and vain, Rose was inspired by Saint-Exupéry's Salvadoran wife Consuelo de Saint-Exupéry,[33][35] with the small home planet being inspired by El Salvador where he crashed and stayed to recover while being within view of 3 volcanoes, one of which was Ilamatepec, also known as The Santa Ana Volcano.[36] Despite a tumultuous marriage, Saint-Exupéry kept Consuelo close to his heart and portrayed her as the prince's rose, whom he tenderly protects with a wind screen and places under a glass dome on his tiny planet. Saint-Exupéry's infidelity and the doubts of his marriage are symbolized by the vast field of roses the prince encounters during his visit to Earth.[9]\n\n\nThis interpretation was described by biographer Paul Webster who stated she was \"the muse to whom Saint-Exupéry poured out his soul in copious letters ... Consuelo was the rose in *The Little Prince*. \"I should have judged her by her acts and not by her words\", says the prince. \"She wrapped herself around me and enlightened me. I should never have fled. I should have guessed at the tenderness behind her poor ruses.\"[24]\n\n\n\n### Prince[edit]\n\n\nSaint-Exupéry probably has drawn inspiration for the prince's character and appearance from his own self as a youth, as during his early years friends and family called him *le Roi-Soleil* (\"the Sun King\") because of his golden curly hair.[*citation needed*] The author had also met a precocious eight-year-old with curly blond hair while he was residing with a family in Quebec City in 1942, Thomas De Koninck, the son of philosopher Charles De Koninck.[37][38][39] Another possible inspiration for the little prince has been suggested as Land Morrow Lindbergh, the young, golden-haired son of fellow aviator Charles Lindbergh and his wife, Anne Morrow Lindbergh, whom he met during an overnight stay at their Long Island home in 1939.[40][41][Note 4]\n\n\nSome have seen the prince as a Christ figure, as the child is sin-free and \"believes in a life after death\", subsequently returning to his personal heaven.[42] When *Life* photojournalist John Phillips questioned the author-aviator on his inspiration for the child character, Saint-Exupéry told him that one day he looked down on what he thought was a blank sheet and saw a small childlike figure: \"I asked him who he was\", he replied. \"I'm the Little Prince\" was the reply.[43]\n\n\nOne of Saint-Exupéry's earliest literary references to a small prince is to be found in his second news dispatch from Moscow, dated 14 May 1935. In his writings as a special correspondent for *Paris-Soir*, the author described traveling from France to the Soviet Union by train. Late at night, during the trip, he ventured from his first-class accommodation into the third-class carriages, where he came upon large groups of Polish families huddled together, returning to their homeland. His commentary not only described a diminutive prince but also touched on several other themes Saint-Exupéry incorporated into various philosophical writings:[44]\n\n\n\n\n> I sat down [facing a sleeping] couple. Between the man and the woman a child had hollowed himself out a place and fallen asleep. He turned in his slumber, and in the dim lamplight I saw his face. What an adorable face! A golden fruit had been born of these two peasants..... This is a musician's face, I told myself. This is the child Mozart. This is a life full of beautiful promise. Little princes in legends are not different from this. Protected, sheltered, cultivated, what could not this child become? When by mutation a new rose is born in a garden, all gardeners rejoice. They isolate the rose, tend it, foster it. But there is no gardener for men. This little Mozart will be shaped like the rest by the common stamping machine.... This little Mozart is condemned.\n> \n> — A Sense of Life: En Route to the U.S.S.R.\n> \n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The writer-aviator on Lac Saint-Louis during a speaking tour in support of France after its armistice with Germany. He started his work on the novella shortly after returning to the United States (Quebec, 1942).\nUpon the outbreak of the Second World War, a laureate of several of France's highest literary awards and a successful pioneering aviator prior to the war, Saint-Exupéry initially flew with a reconnaissance squadron as a reserve military pilot in the *Armée de l'Air* (French Air Force).[9] After France's defeat in 1940 and its armistice with Germany, he and Consuelo fled Occupied France and sojourned in North America, with Saint-Exupéry first arriving by himself at the very end of December 1940. His intention for the visit was to convince the United States to quickly enter the war against Nazi Germany and the Axis forces, and he soon became one of the expatriate voices of the French Resistance. In the midst of personal upheavals and failing health, he produced almost half of the writings for which he would be remembered, including a tender tale of loneliness, friendship, love and loss, in the form of a young prince visiting Earth.[45]\n\n\nAn earlier memoir by the author recounted his aviation experiences in the Sahara, and he is thought to have drawn on the same experiences as plot elements in *The Little Prince*.\n\n\nHe wrote and illustrated the manuscript during the summer and fall of 1942. Although greeted warmly by French-speaking Americans and by fellow expatriates who had preceded him in New York, his 27-month stay would be marred by health problems and racked with periods of severe stress, martial and marital strife. These included partisan attacks on the author's neutral stance towards supporters of both ardent French Gaullist and Vichy France.[46] Saint-Exupéry's American translator (the author spoke poor English) wrote: \"He was restless and unhappy in exile, seeing no way to fight again for his country and refusing to take part in the political quarrels that set Frenchman against Frenchman.\"[22] However, the period was to be both a \"dark but productive time\" during which he created three important works.[47]\n\n\nBetween January 1941 and April 1943, the Saint-Exupérys lived in two penthouse apartments on Central Park South,[48] then the Bevin House mansion in Asharoken, New York, and still later at a rented house on Beekman Place in New York City.[49][50]\n\n\nThe couple also stayed in Quebec for five weeks during the late spring of 1942, where they met a precocious eight-year-old boy with blond curly hair, Thomas, the son of philosopher Charles De Koninck, with whom the Saint-Exupérys resided.[51][52][53][54] During an earlier visit to Long Island in August 1939, Saint-Exupéry had also met Land Morrow Lindbergh, the young, golden-haired son of the pioneering American aviator Charles Lindbergh and his wife, Anne Morrow Lindbergh.[40][41]\n\n\nAfter returning to the US from his Quebec speaking tour, Saint-Exupéry was pressed to work on a children's book by Elizabeth Reynal, one of the wives of his US publisher, Reynal & Hitchcock. The French wife of Eugene Reynal had closely observed Saint-Exupéry for several months, and noting his ill health and high stress levels, she suggested to him that working on a children's story would help.[55][Note 5] The author wrote and illustrated *The Little Prince* at various locations in New York City but principally in the Long Island north-shore community of Asharoken in mid-to-late 1942, with the manuscript being completed in October.[50][51][51]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Bevin House on Long Island, one of the locations in which *The Little Prince* was written during the summer and fall of 1942.[50]\nAlthough the book was started in his Central Park South penthouse, Saint-Exupéry soon found New York City's noise and sweltering summer heat too uncomfortable to work in and so Consuelo was dispatched to find improved accommodations. After spending some time at an unsuitable clapboard country house in Westport, Connecticut,[56] they found Bevin House, a 22-room mansion in Asharoken that overlooked Long Island Sound. The author-aviator initially complained, \"I wanted a hut, and it's the Palace of Versailles.\"[45] As the weeks wore on, the author became invested in his project and the home would become \"a haven for writing, the best place I have ever had anywhere in my life.\"[57] He devoted himself to the book on mostly midnight shifts,[22] usually starting at about 11 pm, fueled by helpings of scrambled eggs on English muffins, gin and tonics, Coca-Colas, cigarettes and numerous visits by friends and expatriates who dropped in to see their famous countryman. One of the visitors was his wife's Swiss writer paramour Denis de Rougemont, who also modeled for a painting of the Little Prince lying on his stomach, feet and arms extended up in the air.[45][50] De Rougemont would later help Consuelo write her autobiography, *The Tale of the Rose*, as well as write his own biography of Saint-Exupéry.\n\n\nWhile the author's personal life was frequently chaotic, his creative process while writing was disciplined. Christine Nelson, curator of literary and historical manuscripts at the Morgan Library and Museum which had obtained Saint-Exupéry's original manuscript in 1968, stated: \"On the one hand, he had a clear vision for the shape, tone, and message of the story. On the other hand, he was ruthless about chopping out entire passages that just weren't quite right\", eventually distilling the 30,000 word manuscript, accompanied by small illustrations and sketches, to approximately half its original length.[58] The story, the curator added, was created when he was \"an ex-patriate and distraught about what was going on in his country and in the world.\"[14]\n\n\nThe large white Second French Empire-style mansion, hidden behind tall trees, afforded the writer a multitude of work environments, but he usually wrote at a large dining table.[22] It also allowed him to alternately work on his writings and then on his sketches and watercolours for hours at a time, moving his armchair and paint easel from the library towards the parlor one room at a time in search of sunlight. His meditative view of sunsets at the Bevin House were incorporated in the book, where the prince visits a small planet with 43 daily sunsets, a planet where all that is needed to watch a sunset \"is move your chair a few steps.\"[45][50][Note 6]\n\n\n\n### Manuscript[edit]\n\n\nThe original 140-page autograph manuscript of *The Little Prince*, along with various drafts and trial drawings, were acquired from the author's close friend Silvia Hamilton in 1968 by curator Herbert Cahoon of the Pierpont Morgan Library (now The Morgan Library & Museum) in Manhattan, New York City.[11][59][60] It is the only known surviving handwritten draft of the complete work.[61] The manuscript's pages include large amounts of the author's prose that was struck-through and therefore not published as part of the first edition. In addition to the manuscript, several watercolour illustrations by the author are also held by the museum. They were not part of the first edition. The institution has marked both the 50th and 70th anniversaries of the novella's publication, along with the centenary celebration of the author's birth, with major exhibitions of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry's literary works.[33][62] Physically, the manuscript's onion skin media has become brittle and subject to damage. Saint-Exupéry's handwriting is described as being doctor-like, verging on indecipherable.[63]\n\n\nThe story's keynote aphorism, *On ne voit bien qu'avec le cœur. L'essentiel est invisible pour les yeux* (\"One sees clearly only with the heart. What is essential is invisible to the eye\") was reworded and rewritten some 15 times before achieving its final phrasing. Saint-Exupéry also used a Dictaphone recorder to produce oral drafts for his typist.[22][59] His initial 30,000-word working manuscript was distilled to less than half its original size through laborious editing sessions. Multiple versions of its many pages were created and its prose then polished over several drafts, with the author occasionally telephoning friends at 2:00 a.m. to solicit opinions on his newly written passages.[22]\n\n\nMany pages and illustrations were cut from the finished work as he sought to maintain a sense of ambiguity to the story's theme and messages. Included among the deletions in its 17th chapter were references to locales in New York, such as the Rockefeller Center and Long Island. Other deleted pages described the prince's vegetarian diet and the garden on his home asteroid that included beans, radishes, potatoes and tomatoes, but which lacked fruit trees that might have overwhelmed the prince's planetoid. Deleted chapters discussed visits to other asteroids occupied by a retailer brimming with marketing phrases, and an inventor whose creation could produce any object desired at a touch of its controls. Likely the result of the ongoing war in Europe weighing on Saint-Exupéry's shoulders, the author produced a sombre three-page epilogue lamenting \"On one star someone has lost a friend, on another someone is ill, on another someone is at war...\", with the story's pilot-narrator noting of The Prince: \"he sees all that. . . . For him, the night is hopeless. And for me, his friend, the night is also hopeless.\" The draft epilogue was also omitted from the novella's printing.[59]\n\n\n\nFurther information:  Morgan exhibitions\n\nIn April 2012 a Parisian auction house announced the discovery of two previously unknown draft manuscript pages that included new text.[10][64] In the newly discovered material the Prince meets his first Earthling after his arrival. The person he meets is an \"ambassador of the human spirit\".[10][64] The ambassador is too busy to talk, saying he is searching for a missing six letter word: \"I am looking for a six-letter word that starts with G that means 'gargling' \", he says. Saint-Exupéry's text does not say what the word is, but experts believe it could be \"guerre\" (or \"war\"). The novella thus takes a more politicized tack with an anti-war sentiment, as 'to gargle' in French is an informal reference to 'honour', which the author may have viewed as a key factor in military confrontations between nations.[64][65]\n\n\n\n### Dedication[edit]\n\n\nSaint-Exupéry met Léon Werth (1878–1955), a writer and art critic, in 1931. Werth soon became Saint-Exupery's closest friend outside of his Aeropostale associates. Werth was an anarchist, a leftist Bolshevik supporter of Jewish descent, twenty-two years older than Saint-Exupéry.\n\n\n\nSaint-Exupéry dedicated two books to him, *Lettre à un otage [fr]* (*Letter to a Hostage*) and *Le Petit Prince* (*The Little Prince*), and referred to Werth in three more of his works. At the beginning of the Second World War while writing *The Little Prince*, Saint-Exupéry lived in his downtown New York City apartment, thinking of his native France and his friends. Werth spent the war unobtrusively in Saint-Amour, his village in the Jura, a mountainous region near Switzerland where he was \"alone, cold and hungry\", a place that had few polite words for French refugees. Werth appears in the preamble to the novella, where Saint-Exupéry dedicates the book to him:[66]\n\n\n> \n> To Leon Werth\n> \n> \n> I ask children to forgive me for dedicating this book to a grown-up. I have a serious excuse: this grown-up is the best friend I have in the world. I have another excuse: this grown-up can understand everything, even books for children. I have a third excuse: he lives in France where he is hungry and cold. He needs to be comforted. If all these excuses are not enough then I want to dedicate this book to the child whom this grown-up once was. All grown-ups were children first. (But few of them remember it.) So I correct my dedication:\n> \n> \n> To Leon Werth,  \n> \n> \n> \n> \n> When he was a little boy\n> \n> \n\n\nSaint-Exupéry's aircraft disappeared over the Mediterranean in July 1944. The following month, Werth learned of his friend's disappearance from a radio broadcast. Without having yet heard of *The Little Prince*, in November, Werth discovered that Saint-Exupéry had published a fable the previous year in the U.S., which he had illustrated himself, and that it was dedicated to him.[67] At the end of the Second World War, which Antoine de Saint-Exupéry did not live to see, Werth said: \"Peace, without Tonio (Saint-Exupéry) isn't entirely peace.\" Werth did not see the text for which he was so responsible until five months after his friend's death, when Saint-Exupéry's French publisher, Gallimard, sent him a special edition. Werth died in Paris in 1955.\n\n\n\n### Illustrations[edit]\n\n\nAll of the novella's simple but elegant watercolour illustrations, which were integral to the story, were painted by Saint-Exupéry. He had studied architecture as a young adult but nevertheless could not be considered an artist – which he self-mockingly alluded to in the novella's introduction. Several of his illustrations were painted on the wrong side of the delicate onion skin paper that he used, his medium of choice.[50] As with some of his draft manuscripts, he occasionally gave away preliminary sketches to close friends and colleagues; others were even recovered as crumpled balls from the floors in the cockpits he flew.[Note 7] Two or three original *Little Prince* drawings were reported in the collections of New York artist, sculptor and experimental filmmaker Joseph Cornell.[68] One rare original *Little Prince* watercolour would be mysteriously sold at a second-hand book fair in Japan in 1994, and subsequently authenticated in 2007.[69][70]\n\n\nAn unrepentant lifelong doodler and sketcher, Saint-Exupéry had for many years sketched little people on his napkins, tablecloths, letters to paramours and friends, lined notebooks and other scraps of paper.[43][45] Early figures took on a multitude of appearances, engaged in a variety of tasks. Some appeared as doll-like figures, baby puffins, angels with wings, and even a figure similar to that in Robert Crumb's *Keep On Truckin'* of 1968. In a 1940 letter to a friend, he sketched a character with his own thinning hair, sporting a bow tie, viewed as a boyish alter-ego, and he later gave a similar doodle to Elizabeth Reynal at his New York publisher's office.[43] Most often the diminutive figure was expressed as \"...a slip of a boy with a turned up nose, lots of hair, long baggy pants that were too short for him and with a long scarf that whipped in the wind. Usually the boy had a puzzled expression... [T]his boy Saint-Exupéry came to think of as \"the little prince\", and he was usually found standing on top of a tiny planet. Most of the time he was alone, sometimes walking up a path. Sometimes there was a single flower on the planet.\"[56] His characters were frequently seen chasing butterflies; when asked why they did so, Saint-Exupéry, who thought of the figures as his alter-egos, replied that they were actually pursuing a \"realistic ideal\".[45] Saint-Exupéry eventually settled on the image of the young, precocious child with curly blond hair, an image which would become the subject of speculations as to its source. One \"most striking\" illustration depicted the pilot-narrator asleep beside his stranded plane prior to the prince's arrival. Although images of the narrator were created for the story, none survived Saint-Exupéry's editing process.[14]\n\n\nTo mark both the 50th and 70th anniversaries of *The Little Prince's* publication, the Morgan Library and Museum mounted major exhibitions of Saint-Exupéry's draft manuscript, preparatory drawings, and similar materials that it had obtained earlier from a variety of sources. One major source was an intimate friend of his in New York City, Silvia Hamilton (later, Reinhardt), to whom the author gave his working manuscript just prior to returning to Algiers to resume his work as a Free French Air Force pilot.[33][62][71] Hamilton's black poodle, Mocha, is believed to have been the model for the Little Prince's sheep, with a Raggedy Ann type doll helping as a stand-in for the prince.[61] Additionally, a pet boxer, Hannibal, that Hamilton gave to him as a gift may have been the model for the story's desert fox and its tiger.[47] A museum representative stated that the novella's final drawings were lost.[33]\n\n\nSeven unpublished drawings for the book were also displayed at the museum's exhibit, including fearsome looking baobab trees ready to destroy the prince's home asteroid, as well as a picture of the story's narrator, the forlorn pilot, sleeping next to his aircraft. That image was likely omitted to avoid giving the story a 'literalness' that would distract its readers, according to one of the Morgan Library's staff.[33] According to Christine Nelson, curator of literary and historical manuscripts at the Morgan, \"[t]he image evokes Saint-Exupéry's own experience of awakening in an isolated, mysterious place. You can almost imagine him wandering without much food and water and conjuring up the character of the Little Prince.\"[14] Another reviewer noted that the author \"chose the best illustrations... to maintain the ethereal tone he wanted his story to exude. Choosing between ambiguity and literal text and illustrations, Saint-Exupéry chose in every case to obfuscate.\"[72] Not a single drawing of the story's narrator–pilot survived the author's editing process; \"he was very good at excising what was not essential to his story\".[14]\n\n\nIn 2001 Japanese researcher Yoshitsugu Kunugiyama surmised that the cover illustration Saint-Exupéry painted for *Le Petit Prince* deliberately depicted a stellar arrangement created to celebrate the author's own centennial of birth. According to Kunugiyama, the cover art chosen from one of Saint-Exupéry's watercolour illustrations contained the planets Saturn and Jupiter, plus the star Aldebaran, arranged as an isosceles triangle, a celestial configuration which occurred in the early 1940s, and which he likely knew would next reoccur in the year 2000.[73] Saint-Exupéry possessed superior mathematical skills and was a master celestial navigator, a vocation he had studied at Salon-de-Provence with the *Armée de l'Air* (French Air Force).\n\n\n\n### Post-publication[edit]\n\n\nStacy Schiff, one of Saint-Exupéry's principal biographers, wrote of him and his most famous work, \"rarely have an author and a character been so intimately bound together as Antoine de Saint-Exupéry and his Little Prince\", and remarking of their dual fates, \"the two remain tangled together, twin innocents who fell from the sky\".[74] Another noted that the novella's mystique was \"enhanced by the parallel between author and subject: imperious innocents whose lives consist of equal parts flight and failed love, who fall to earth, are little impressed with what they find here and ultimately disappear without a trace.\"[75]\n\n\nOnly weeks after his novella was first published in April 1943, despite his wife's pleadings and before Saint-Exupéry had received any of its royalties (he never would), the author-aviator joined the Free French Forces. He would remain immensely proud of *The Little Prince*, and almost always kept a personal copy with him which he often read to others during the war.[74]\n\n\n\nFurther information:  Antoine de Saint-Exupéry – Disappearance\n\nAs part of a 32-ship military convoy he voyaged to North Africa where he rejoined his old squadron to fight with the Allies, resuming his work as a reconnaissance pilot despite the best efforts of his friends, colleagues and fellow airmen who could not prevent him from flying.[Note 8] He had previously escaped death by the barest of margins a number of times, but was then lost in action during a July 1944 spy mission from the moonscapes of Corsica to the continent in preparation for the Allied invasion of occupied France, only three weeks before the Liberation of Paris.[45][Note 9]\n\n\n\n### Reception[edit]\n\n\nMany of the book's initial reviewers were flummoxed by the fable's multi-layered story line and its morals,[9] perhaps expecting a significantly more conventional story from one of France's leading writers. Its publisher had anticipated such reactions to a work that fell neither exclusively into a children's nor adults' literature classification. *The New York Times* reviewer wrote shortly before its publication \"What makes a good children's book? ... *The Little Prince*, which is a fascinating fable for grown-ups [is] of conjectural value for boys and girls of 6, 8 and 10. [It] may very well be a book on the order of *Gulliver's Travels*, something that exists on two levels\"; \"Can you clutter up a narrative with paradox and irony and still hold the interest of 8 and 10-year olds?\" Notwithstanding the story's duality, the review added that major portions of the story would probably still \"capture the imagination of any child.\"[78] Addressing whether it was written for children or adults, Reynal & Hitchcock promoted it ambiguously, saying that as far as they were concerned \"it's the new book by Saint-Exupéry\", adding to its dustcover \"There are few stories which in some way, in some degree, change the world forever for their readers. This is one.\"[59]\n\n\nOthers were not shy in offering their praise. Austin Stevens, also of *The New York Times*, stated that the story possessed \"...large portions of the Saint-Exupéry philosophy and poetic spirit. In a way it's a sort of credo.\"[56] P.L. Travers, author of the Mary Poppins series of children books, wrote in a *New York Herald Tribune* review: \"*The Little Prince* will shine upon children with a sidewise gleam. It will strike them in some place that is not the mind and glow there until the time comes for them to comprehend it.\"[59][79]\n\n\nBritish journalist Neil Clark, in *The American Conservative* in 2009, offered an expansive view of Saint-Exupéry's overall work by commenting that it provides a \"…bird's eye view of humanity [and] contains some of the most profound observations on the human condition ever written\", and that the author's novella \"doesn't merely express his contempt for selfishness and materialism [but] shows how life should be lived.\"[80]\n\n\nThe book enjoyed modest initial success, residing on *The New York Times* Best Seller list for only two weeks,[63] as opposed to his earlier 1939 English translation, *Wind, Sand and Stars* which remained on the same list for nearly five months.[43] As a cultural icon, the novella regularly draws new readers and reviewers, selling almost two million copies annually and also spawning numerous adaptations. Modern-day references to *The Little Prince* include one from *The New York Times* that describes it as \"abstract\" and \"fabulistic\".[62]\n\n\n\n## Literary translations and printed editions[edit]\n\n\nSee also: The Little Prince § Translations\n\n![](image)Two editions of *The Little Prince* (lower left in French and upper right in English, artwork not shown) in the Saint-Exupéry permanent exhibit at the French Air and Space Museum, Le Bourget, Paris (2008)\n![](image)Some of the more than 250 translations of *The Little Prince*, these editions displayed at the National Museum of Ethnology, Osaka, Japan (2013)\nAs of April 2017,[81] *The Little Prince* became the world's most translated non-religious book (into 300 languages) together with Italian novel *The Adventures of Pinocchio*.\n\n\nKatherine Woods (1886–1968)[82] produced the first English translation of 1943, which was later joined by several other English translations. Her translation contained some errors.[83][84] Mistranslations aside, one reviewer noted that Wood's almost \"poetic\" English translation has long been admired by many *Little Prince* lovers, who have spanned generations (it stayed in print until 2001), as her work maintains Saint-Exupéry's story-telling spirit and charm, if not its literal accuracy.[72] As of 2019[update] at least seven additional English translations have been published:[85]\n\n\n\n* Irene Testot-Ferry, (ISBN 0-7567-5189-6, 1st ed. 1995)\n* T.V.F.

As of 2017, it has been translated into more than 300 languages and dialects, including Sardinian,[90] the constructed international languages of Esperanto and Klingon, and the Congolese language Alur, as well as being printed in Braille for blind readers. It is also often used as an introduction into endangered varieties with very few speakers like Maya (2001), Aromanian (2006) or Banat Bulgarian (2017). It is one of the few modern books to have been translated into Latin, as *Regulus, vel Pueri soli sapiunt*[91][92] in 1961 by Auguste Haury (1910–2002) and as *Regulus* in 2010 by Alexander Winkler. In 2005, the book was also translated into Toba Qom, an indigenous language of northern Argentina, as *So Shiyaxauolec Nta'a*. It was the first book translated into that language since the New Testament. It was also translated to a northern Italian dialect, Vogherese. Anthropologist Florence Tola, commenting on the suitability of the work for Toban translation, said there is \"nothing strange [when] the Little Prince speaks with a snake or a fox and travels among the stars, it fits perfectly into the Toba mythology\".[93]\n\n\nLinguists have compared the many translations and even editions of the same translation for style, composition, titles, wordings and genealogy. As an example: as of 2011 there are approximately 47 translated editions of *The Little Prince* in Korean,[Note 10] and there are also about 50 different translated editions in Chinese (produced in both mainland China and Taiwan). Many of them are titled *Prince From a Star*, while others carry the book title that is a direct translation of *The Little Prince*.[95] By studying the use of word phrasings, nouns, mistranslations and other content in newer editions, linguists can identify the source material for each version: whether it was derived from the original French typescript, or from its first translation into English by Katherine Woods, or from a number of adapted sources.[72][96]\n\n\nThe first edition to be published in France, Saint-Exupéry's birthplace, was printed by his regular publisher in that country, Gallimard, only after[8] the German occupation of France ended.[97][Note 11] Prior to France's liberation new printings of Saint-Exupéry's works were made available only by means of secret print runs,[99][100] such as that of February 1943 when 1,000 copies of an underground version of his best seller *Pilote de guerre*, describing the German invasion of France, were covertly printed in Lyon.[101]\n\n\nCommemorating the novella's 70th anniversary of publication, in conjunction with the 2014 Morgan Exhibition, Éditions Gallimard released a complete facsimile edition of Saint-Exupéry's original handwritten manuscript entitled *Le Manuscrit du Petit Prince d'Antoine de Saint-Exupéry: Facsimilé et Transcription*, edited by Alban Cerisier and Delphine Lacroix. The book in its final form has also been republished in 70th anniversary editions by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (in English) and by Gallimard (in French).[61]\n\n\nA Portuguese translation of the novella in 2007, edited by Eidouro Gráfica e Editora Ltda and presented at the XIII Biannual Book Fair of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, holds the Guinness World Record for world's largest book published.[102] The impressive tome measures 2.01 m (6 ft 7 in) high and 3.08 m (10 ft 1 in) wide when open, containing 128 pages.\n\n\nIt has been translated into minority languages, such as the Irish language, by Éabhloid publishers in 2015.\n\n\n\n### Spanish editions[edit]\n\n\nAfter being translated by Bonifacio del Carril, *The Little Prince* was first published in Spanish as *El principito* in September 1951 by the Argentine publisher Emecé Editores.[103][104] Other Spanish editions have also been created; in 1956 the Mexican publisher Diana released its first edition of the book, *El pequeño príncipe*, a Spanish translation by José María Francés.[8] Another edition of the work was produced in Spain in 1964 and, four years later, in 1968, editions were also produced in Colombia and Cuba, with translation by Luis Fernández in 1961. Chile had its first translation in 1981; Peru in February 1985; Venezuela in 1986, and Uruguay in 1990.[103][105][106]\nThe book is among the few books in the Castilian cant Gacería[107] (as *El pitoche engrullón*) or the Madrid slang Cheli[108] (as *El chaval principeras*).\n\n\n\n### Bavarian editions[edit]\n\n\n*The Little Prince* has an adaptation for the inhabitants of Bavaria, Austria and South Tyrol, covering for a large variety of the Bavarian language. The book was adapted by Johannes Limmer and published in 2019. It is called *Da gloane Prinz* and contains the original pictures of Saint-Exupéry.[109]\n\n\n\n### Chinese editions[edit]\n\n\n*The Little Prince* is one of the most popular and beloved foreign works of literature in China. It is reported that there are more than 70 Chinese translations of the novella.[110] According to the official website of the Succession Antoine de Saint-Exupéry-d'Agay, the version translated by Li Jihong, which was published in January 2013, sold over two million copies in less than four years.[111] Cheng Li-chun published a translation in Taiwan in May 2022.[112]\n\n\n\n### Extension of copyrights in France[edit]\n\n\nDue to Saint-Exupéry's wartime death, his estate received the civil code designation *Mort pour la France* (English: *Died for France*), which was applied by the French government in 1948. Amongst the law's provisions is an increase of 30 years in the duration of copyright;[113] thus most of Saint-Exupéry's creative works will not fall out of copyright status in France for an extra 30 years.[114][75] So the original French text was in copyright almost everywhere in the world until 1 January 2015, remains under copyright in the US until 2039[115][116] and will remain in copyright in France until 2032.[117] EU law on copyright, however, fluctuates country by country, despite years of attempts to harmonize it at 70 years. French law allows for a copyright of 70 years from the author's death. Saint-Exupery, because of extraordinary service to his nation, is granted an additional 30 years, meaning, in France, Le Petit Prince does not actually fall out of copyright until the end of 2044.[*contradictory*]\n\n\n\n## Adaptations and sequels[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A short 45 RPM demo recording by Richard Burton narrating *The Little Prince* with music by Mort Garson, excerpted from a longer 33⅓ RPM vinyl record album.

Additionally, the title character himself has been adapted in a number of promotional roles, including as a symbol of environmental protection, by the Toshiba Group.[118] He has also been portrayed as a \"virtual ambassador\" in a campaign against smoking, employed by the Veolia Energy Services Group,[118] and his name was used as an episode title in the TV series *Lost*.\n\n\nThe multi-layered fable, styled as a children's story with its philosophical elements of irony and paradox directed towards adults, allowed *The Little Prince* to be transferred into various other art forms and media, including:\n\n\n\n* Vinyl record, cassette and CD: as early as 1954 several audio editions in multiple languages were created on vinyl record, cassette tape and much later as a CD, with one English version narrated by Richard Burton.\n* Radio broadcasts: radio plays were produced in the United States, with Raymond Burr, in 1956, and most recently in the United Kingdom on BBC in a 1999 dramatization by Bonnie Greer, produced by Pam Fraser Solomon.[119]\n* Film and TV: the story has been created as a movie as early as 1966 in a Soviet-Lithuanian production, with its first English movie version in 1974 produced in the United States featuring Bob Fosse, who choreographed his own dance sequence as \"The Snake\", and Gene Wilder as \"The Fox\". In 1987, a Turkish version was adopted into a direct-to-video film by Remzi Aydin Jonturk. Starting in 2010, a three-season-long animated series was made that expanded upon the book. In 2015, a major new 3D film, combining computer animation and stop motion animation, was released as *The Little Prince* in English and *Le Petit Prince* in French.[120][121] In 2023, a 2D-animated series will be released.[122]\n* Stage: *The Little Prince's* popular appeal has lent itself to widespread dramatic adaptations in live stage productions at both the professional and amateur levels. It has become a staple of numerous stage companies, with dozens of productions created.\n* Graphic novel: a new printed version of the story in comic book form, by Joann Sfar in 2008, drew widespread notice.\n* Pop-Up Book: a new printed edition, using the original text (as translated by Richard Howard in 2000) and St. Exupery's original drawings as the basis for elaborate pop-up illustrations, was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (ISBN 978-0-547-26069-3, 1st ed. 2009).\n* Opera and ballet: several operatic and ballet versions of the novella have been produced as early as the Russian *Malen′kiy prints* by Lev Knipper, first performed in 1978 with a symphony score composed in the 1960s.\n* Concert music: Concert Suite on *Le Petit Prince* for solo violin, solo harp and chamber orchestra by Jean-Pascal Beintus (premiered by the DSO Berlin – Kent Nagano – 2008)\n\n\n![](image)One of numerous stage adaptations of Saint-Exupéry's child and adult fable, this one at the University of Minnesota's Rarig Center Proscenium (2010)\n* Anime: a Japanese animation TV series was made in 1978, *Hoshi no Ōjisama: Petit Prince*, containing 39 episodes that do not follow the plot of the original novella. Each episode contains an adventure on a planet, usually Earth, where the little prince meets different people each time and makes friends. Some key elements of the original story have been kept. Namely, the little prince's golden hair, his scarf, laughter, his planet name (B-612), the rose and the three volcanoes. The anime had been aired and dubbed into several languages including Arabic, English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Portuguese and Spanish. The English dub's title is *The Adventures of the Little Prince*.[123]\n* Other: a number of musical references, game boards and a video game version of the novella have been released.\n\n\nIn 1997, Jean-Pierre Davidts wrote what could be considered a sequel to *The Little Prince*, entitled *Le petit prince retrouvé* (*The Little Prince Returns*).[124] In this version, the shipwrecked narrator encounters the little prince on a lone island; the prince has returned to seek help against a tiger who threatens his sheep.[125] Another sequel titled *The Return of the Little Prince* was written by former actress Ysatis de Saint-Simone, niece of Consuelo de Saint-Exupéry.[126]\n\n\n\n## Honours and legacy[edit]\n\n\n### Museums and exhibits[edit]\n\n\n#### Morgan exhibitions[edit]\n\n\nNew York City's Morgan Library & Museum mounted three showings of the original manuscript, with its first showing in 1994, on the occasion of the story's 50th anniversary of publication, followed by one celebrating the author's centennial of birth in 2000, with its last and largest exhibition in 2014 honouring the novella's 70th anniversary.\n\n\nThe 1994 exhibition displayed the original manuscript, translated by the museum's art historian Ruth Kraemer,[127] as well as a number of the story's watercolours drawn from the Morgan's permanent collection. Also included with the exhibits was a 20-minute video it produced, *My Grown-Up Friend, Saint-Exupéry*, narrated by actor Macaulay Culkin,[Note 12] along with photos of the author, correspondence to Consuelo, a signed first edition of *The Little Prince*, and several international editions in other languages.[92]\n\n\nIn January 2014, the museum mounted a third, significantly larger, exhibition centered on the novella's creative origins and its history. The major showing of *The Little Prince: A New York Story* celebrated the story's 70th anniversary.[62] It examined both the novella's New York origins and Saint-Exupéry's creative processes, looking at his story and paintings as they evolved from conceptual germ form into progressively more refined versions and finally into the book's highly polished first edition. It was as if visitors were able to look over his shoulder as he worked, according to curator Christine Nelson. Funding for the 2014 exhibition was provided by several benefactors, including The Florence Gould Foundation, The Caroline Macomber Fund, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Air France and the New York State Council on the Arts.[61]\n\n\nThe new, more comprehensive exhibits included 35 watercolor paintings and 25 of the work's original 140 handwritten manuscript pages,[129] with his almost illegible handwriting penciled onto 'Fidelity' watermarked onion skin paper. The autograph manuscript pages included struck-through content that was not published in the novella's first edition. As well, some 43 preparatory pencil drawings that evolved into the story's illustrations accompanied the manuscript, many of them dampened by moisture that rippled its onion skin media.[130][131] One painting depicted the prince floating above Earth wearing a yellow scarf was wrinkled, having been crumpled up and thrown away before being retrieved for preservation.[47] Another drawing loaned from Silvia Hamilton's grandson depicted the diminutive prince observing a sunset on his home asteroid; two other versions of the same drawing were also displayed alongside it allowing visitors to observe the drawing's progressive refinement.[59] The initial working manuscript and sketches, displayed side by side with pages from the novella's first edition, allowed viewers to observe the evolution of Saint-Exupéry's work.\n\n\nShortly before departing the United States to rejoin his reconnaissance squadron in North Africa in its struggle against Nazi Germany, Saint-Exupéry appeared unexpectedly in military uniform at the door of his intimate friend, Silvia Hamilton. He presented his working manuscript and its preliminary drawings in a \"rumpled paper bag\", placed onto her home's entryway table, offering, \"I'd like to give you something splendid, but this is all I have\".[62][71][79][131][132] Several of the manuscript pages bore accidental coffee stains and cigarette scorch marks.[47] The Morgan later acquired the 30,000-word manuscript from Hamilton in 1968, with its pages becoming the centrepieces of its exhibitions on Saint-Exupéry's work. The 2014 exhibition also borrowed artifacts and the author's personal letters from the Saint-Exupéry-d'Gay Estate,[Note 13] as well as materials from other private collections, libraries and museums in the United States and France.[133] Running concurrent with its 2014 exhibition, the Morgan held a series of lectures, concerts and film showings, including talks by Saint-Exupéry biographer Stacy Schiff, writer Adam Gopnik, and author Peter Sís on his new work *The Pilot and The Little Prince: The Life of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry*,[132][134]\n\n\nAdditional exhibits included photos of Saint-Exupéry by *Life* photojournalist John Phillips, other photos of the author's New York area homes,[61] an Orson Welles screenplay of the novella the filmmaker attempted to produce as a movie in collaboration with Walt Disney,[43][62][Note 14] as well as one of the few signed copies extant of *The Little Prince*, gifted to Hamilton's 12-year-old son.[Note 15]\n\n\n\n#### Permanent exhibits[edit]\n\n\n* In Le Bourget, Paris, France, the Air and Space Museum of France established a special exhibit honoring Saint-Exupéry, and which displays many of his literary creations. Among them are various early editions of *The Little Prince*. Remnants of the Free French Air Force P-38 Lightning in which he disappeared, and which were recovered from the Mediterranean in 2004, are also on view.\n* In Hakone, Japan there is the Museum of The Little Prince featuring outdoor squares and sculptures such as the B-612 Asteroid, the Lamplighter Square, and a sculpture of the Little Prince. The museum grounds additionally feature a *Little Prince Park* along with the *Consuelo Rose Garden*; however the main portion of the museum are its indoor exhibits.\n* In Gyeonggi-do, South Korea, there is an imitation French village, Petite France, which has adapted the story elements of *The Little Prince* into its architecture and monuments. There are several sculptures of the story's characters, and the village also offers overnight housing in some of the French-style homes. Featured are the history of *The Little Prince*, an art gallery, and a small amphitheatre situated in the middle of the village for musicians and other performances. The enterprise's director stated that in 2009 the village received a half million visitors.[94][135][136]\n\n\n#### Special exhibitions[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)The Little Prince as part of a street art project in Funchal (Madeira)In 1996 the Danish sculptor Jens Galschiøt unveiled an artistic arrangement consisting of seven blocks of granite asteroids 'floating' in a circle around a 2-metre tall planet Earth. The artistic universe was populated by bronze sculpture figures that the little prince met on his journeys. As in the book, the prince discovers that \"the essential is invisible to the eye, and only by the heart can you really see\". The work was completed at the start of 1996 and placed in the central square of Fuglebjerg, Denmark,[137] but was later stolen from an exhibition in Billund in 2011.[138]\n* During 2009 in São Paulo, Brazil, the giant Oca Art Exhibition Centre presented The Little Prince as part of The Year of France and *The Little Prince*. The displays covered over 10,000 square metres on four floors, examining Saint-Exupéry, The Little Prince and their philosophies, as visitors passed through theme areas of the desert, different worlds, stars and the cosmos. The ground floor of the exhibit area was laid out as a huge map of the routes flown by the author and Aeropostale in South America and around the world. Also included was a full-scale replica of his Caudron Simoun, crashed in a simulated Sahara Desert.[139][140][141]\n* In 2012 the Catalan architect Jan Baca unveiled a sculpture in Terrassa, Catalonia showing the Little Prince along with the sentence, \"It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye\".[142]\n* In February 2022, nearly eight decades after it was written, \"The Little Prince\" arrived in Paris. The exhibit began on February 17 and ended on June 26. It contained 600 items, including photographs, poems, and newspaper clippings relating to \"The Little Prince.\"[143]\n\n\n### Places[edit]\n\n\n#### Playground[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sculpture of the lamplighter in a \"story playground\" themed after *The Little Prince* in Holon, Israel\n* One of the \"story playgrounds\" – a series of playgrounds themed after famous children's stories in Holon, Israel – is themed after *The Little Prince*. It features sculptures and play structures depicting scenes and characters from the book.\n\n\n#### Schools[edit]\n\n\n* *L'école Le Petit Prince* is the public elementary school in the small community of Genech in northern France, dedicated in 1994 upon the merger of two former schools. With nine classrooms and a library, its building overlooks the village's *Place Terre des Hommes*,[144] a square also named in tribute to Saint-Exupéry's 1939 philosophical memoir, *Terre des hommes*.\n* A K–6 elementary school on Avro Road in Maple, Ontario, Canada, was also opened in 1994 as *L'école élémentaire catholique Le Petit Prince*. Its enrollment expanded from 30 students in its first year to some 325 children by 2014. One of Saint-Exupéry's colourful paintings of the prince is found on its website's welcome page.[145]\n\n\n#### Avenue[edit]\n\n\n* In southern Brazil, in the city of Florianópolis, there is the *Avenida Pequeno Príncipe* (Little Prince Avenue in Portuguese), whose name is a tribute to Saint-Exupéry, who passed through the city during his aviator career, an event that became part of the local culture.[146]\n\n\n### Insignia and awards[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The fighter jet insignia of the GR I/33 [fr], bearing an image of the Little Prince at top\n* Prior to its decommissioning in 2010, the GR I/33 [fr] (later renamed as the 1/33 Belfort Squadron), one of the French Air Force squadrons Saint-Exupéry flew with, adopted the image of the *Little Prince* as part of the squadron and tail insignia of its Dassault Mirage fighter jets.[147] Some of the fastest jets in the world were flown with The Prince gazing over their pilots' shoulders.\n* *The Little Prince Literary Award* for Persian fiction by writers under the age of 15, commemorating the title of Saint-Exupéry's famous work, was created in Iran by the Cheragh-e Motale'eh Literary Foundation. In 2012, some 250 works by young authors were submitted for first stage review according to the society's secretary Maryam Sistani, with the selection of the best three writers from 30 finalists being conducted in Tehran that September.[148][149]\n* Several other Little Prince Awards have also been established in Europe, meant to promote achievement and excellence in a variety of fields such as in assistance to autistic children, child literacy, children's literature (by adults), Puppetry theatre and theatre arts.[150][151][152]\n\n\n### Numismatics and philatelic[edit]\n\n\n* Before France adopted the euro as its currency, Saint-Exupéry and drawings from *The Little Prince* were on the 50-franc banknote; the artwork was by Swiss designer Roger Pfund.[74][153] Among the anti-counterfeiting measures on the banknote was micro-printed text from *Le Petit Prince*, visible with a strong magnifying glass.[154] Additionally, a 100-franc commemorative coin was also released in 2000, with Saint-Exupéry's image on its obverse, and that of the Little Prince on its reverse.[155]\n* In commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the writer's untimely death, Israel issued a stamp honoring \"Saint-Ex\" and *The Little Prince* in 1994.[156] Philatelic tributes have been printed in at least 24 other countries as of 2011.[157]\n\n\n### Astronomy[edit]\n\n\n* The B612 Foundation is a private foundation created to track Near-Earth objects that might pose a threat to Earth, and is dedicated to protecting the planet from asteroid strikes, similar to the Tunguska event of 1908. The private foundation was founded by a group of U.S. scientists and astronauts, including Clark Chapman, Piet Hut, Rusty Schweickart and Ed Lu in October 2002. The non-profit organization is named in honour of the prince's home asteroid.[158]\n* An asteroid discovered in 1975, 2578 Saint-Exupéry, was also named after the author of *The Little Prince*.[159]\n* Another asteroid discovered in 1993 was named 46610 Bésixdouze, which is French for \"B six twelve\". The asteroid's number, 46610, becomes `B612` in hexadecimal notation. B-612 was the name of the prince's home asteroid.\n* In 2003 a small asteroid moon, Petit-Prince, discovered earlier in 1998, was named in part after *The Little Prince*.[160]\n\n\n### Professional wrestling[edit]\n\n\nFrench professional wrestler Daniel Dubail was billed as Le Petit Prince.[161]\nPakistani-British professional wrestler Mohammed Allam was billed as The Little Prince[162]\n\n\n\n### The Little Prince Day[edit]\n\n\nSince 2020, June 29 is International Little Prince Day. This date was chosen to commemorate the birth of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, which occurred on June 29, 1900. The Antoine de Saint-Exupéry Foundation started the initiative striving to promote the humanist values carried by the book published in 1943. Mark Osborne was one of the first personalities to participate in the Little Prince Day 2020.[163]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Children's literature portal\n* ![icon](image)Speculative fiction portal\n* ![icon](image)Novels portal\n* ![flag](image)France portal\n\n\n* List of *The Little Prince* adaptations, a listing of *The Little Prince* story adapted into various media.\n* *The Little Prince* (1974 film), a 1974 musical film directed by Stanley Donen\n* *The Little Prince* (play), a theatrical adaptation\n* *The Little Prince* (opera), an opera in two acts by Rachel Portman to an English libretto by Nicholas Wright\n* *The Adventures of The Little Prince* (TV series), an anime series\n* *The Little Prince and the Aviator*, a 1981 musical theatre adaptation\n* *Eloise at the Plaza*, a 2003 TV film in which many references to *The Little Prince* can be identified\n* *The Little Prince* (TV series), a 2010 TV series\n* *The Little Prince* (2015 film), a 2015 animated film directed by Mark Osborne\n* *Le Monde*'s 100 Books of the Century\n* *Invisible Essence: The Little Prince*, a 2018 documentary film about the book\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \n\nNote that although Saint-Exupéry's regular French publisher, Gallimard, lists *Le Petit Prince* as being published in 1946, that is apparently a legalistic interpretation possibly designed to allow for an extra year of the novella's copyright protection period, and is based on Gallimard's explanation that the book was only 'sold' starting in 1946. Other sources, such as LePetitPrince.com,[8] record the first Librairie Gallimard printing of 12,250 copies as occurring on 30 November 1945.\n2. **^** The Antoine de Saint-Exupéry Foundation estimates an additional 80 million copies of the story in audio-video formats have been sold worldwide.[13]\n3. **^** \n\nThe plane Saint-Exupéry was flying when he crashed at high speed in the Sahara was a Caudron C-630 Simoun, Serial Number 7042, with the French registration F-ANRY ('F' being the international designator for France, and the remainder chosen by the author to represent ANtoine de saint-exupéRY).\n4. **^** \n\nAccording to Hoffman, \"Anne Morrow Lindbergh's fascination with Saint-Ex was transparent in all she wrote about him, as might be expected when one aviator-writer romantic is writing about another.\" Saint-Exupéry visited with Anne for two days but spoke with Charles Lindbergh, who arrived home late, for an hour. Besides their vast differences on how Adolf Hitler and the European conflict should be treated, Charles did not speak French, and Saint-Exupéry did not speak English well. Their discussions, passed through Anne's meager French, were somewhat muted. However, the excited conversation between Antoine and Anne soon blossomed \"like monster flowers\", with each finishing the other's sentences. Ironically, while Saint-Exupéry would later campaign for an early US entry into the war, Lindbergh strongly opposed American involvement in the European war and wanted an arrangement with Hitler, like Stalin's. The meeting between the two future P-38 war pilots was termed \"less than a rousing success\". Moreover, Charles later became unhappy about his wife's vast esteem for the French adventurer.\"\n5. **^** Another source states that it was co-publisher Curtice Hitchcock who viewed the author sketches and doodles at a supper party one evening and then suggested writing a children's book to Saint-Exupéry.[56] An additional likely reason for the publisher's encouragement: P.

Travers, the author of the popular children's books series on *Mary Poppins*, was at that time working on her third installment that would be published by a Reynal & Hitchcock competitor in 1943, the same year as *The Little Prince*. Saint-Exupéry's U.S. publisher pressed him to have a competing children's book on the market for Christmas 1942.\n6. **^** \n\nSaint-Exupéry was 43 the year the fable was published, and 44 the year he died. He originally wrote the story with 43 sunsets, but posthumous editions often quote '44 sunsets', possibly in tribute.\n7. **^** \n\nOn one of Saint-Exupéry's flights his aircraft engine started failing. His aircraft mechanic onboard later recalled that Saint-Exupéry was completely calm, \"Saint-Ex simply started doodling cartoons which he handed back to me with a big grin.\"[24]\n8. **^** \n\nFollowing one of his crashes in a sophisticated single-pilot spy aircraft that resulted in him being grounded, Saint-Exupéry spared no effort in his campaign to return to active combat flying duty. He utilized all his contacts and powers of persuasion to overcome his age and physical handicap barriers, which would have completely barred an ordinary patriot from serving as a war pilot. Instrumental in his reinstatement was an agreement he proposed to John Phillips, a fluently bilingual *Life Magazine* correspondent in February 1944, where Saint-Exupéry committed to \"write, and I'll donate what I do to you, for your publication, if you get me reinstated into my squadron.\"[76] Phillips later met with a high-level U.S. Army Air Forces press officer in Italy, Colonel John Reagan McCrary, who conveyed the *Life Magazine* request to General Eaker. Eaker's approval for Saint-Exupéry's return to flying status would be made \"not through favoritism, but through exception.\" The brutalized French, it was noted, would cut a German's throat \"probably with more relish than anybody.\"\n9. **^** \n\nVarious sources state that his final flight was either his seventh, eight, ninth, or even his tenth covert reconnaissance mission. He volunteered for almost every such proposed mission submitted to his squadron, and protested fiercely after being grounded following his second sortie which ended with a demolished P-38. His connections in high places, plus a publishing agreement with *Life Magazine*, were instrumental in having the grounding order against him lifted.[77] For some time Saint-Exupéry's friends, colleagues, and compatriots were actively working to keep the aging, accident-prone author grounded, out of harm's way.\n10. **^** \n\nIn 2009, the director of the *Village Petite France* (Little France Village) in South Korea stated that there were 350 different editions of *Orin Wanja* (The Little Prince) in Korean, including editions in Manga.[94]\n11. **^** A further complication occurred due to Saint-Exupéry's opinions of French General Charles de Gaulle, whom he held in low regard. Even though both men were working to free France from Nazi occupation, Saint-Exupéry saw de Gaulle with apprehension and consequently provided no public support to the General. In response, de Gaulle struck back at the author by implying that the author was a German supporter, and then had all his literary works banned in France's North African colonies. Saint-Exupéry's writings were, with irony, banned simultaneously in both occupied France and Free France.[98][74]\n12. **^** \n\nAlthough Macaulay Culkin had been earning approximately $8 million per film project at that point, he provided his narration to the museum \"for nothing, and we are grateful for his services\", according to a Morgan representative.[128]\n13. **^** The *d'Gay* portion of the estate refers to Saint-Exupéry's married sister.\n14. **^** \nOrson Welles purchased the movie rights to the story the day after reading the novella in a single sitting.[61] Welles was unable to persuade Walt Disney to assist him in turning his screenplay of the story into a film, with Disney fearing such a screen release would upstage his own screen adaptations of other stories.\n15. **^** \n\nThe signed copy is inscribed \"For Stephen, to whom I have already spoken about *The Little Prince*, and who perhaps will be his friend\".[58]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** de Saint-Exupéry & Woods 1943.\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** genome.ch.bbc.co.uk, accessed 9 October 2021\n3. **^** de Saint-Exupéry & Cuffe 2006.\n4. **^** de Saint-Exupéry & Morpurgo 2018.\n5. **^** de Saint-Exupéry & Testot-Ferry 2018.\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"'Definitive' Translation of 'Le Petit Prince'\", *New Straits Times*, 20 September 2000.

K. Rowling. The first novel in the *Harry Potter* series and Rowling's debut novel, it follows Harry Potter, a young wizard who discovers his magical heritage on his eleventh birthday, when he receives a letter of acceptance to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry makes close friends and a few enemies during his first year at the school and with the help of his friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, he faces an attempted comeback by the dark wizard Lord Voldemort, who killed Harry's parents, but failed to kill Harry when he was just 15 months old.\n\n\nThe book was first published in the United Kingdom on 26 June 1997 by Bloomsbury. It was published in the United States the following year by Scholastic Corporation under the title ***Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone***. It won most of the British book awards that were judged by children and other awards in the US. The book reached the top of the *New York Times* list of best-selling fiction in August 1999 and stayed near the top of that list for much of 1999 and 2000. It has been translated into at least 73 other languages and has been made into a feature-length film of the same name, as have all six of its sequels. The novel has sold in excess of 120 million copies, making it the fourth best-selling book of all time.[1][2]\n\n\nMost reviews were very favourable, commenting on Rowling's imagination, humour, simple, direct style and clever plot construction, although a few complained that the final chapters seemed rushed. The writing has been compared to that of Jane Austen, one of Rowling's favourite authors; Roald Dahl, whose works dominated children's stories before the appearance of Harry Potter; and the ancient Greek story-teller Homer. While some commentators thought the book looked backwards to Victorian and Edwardian boarding school stories, others thought it placed the genre firmly in the modern world by featuring contemporary ethical and social issues, as well as overcoming obstacles like bullying.\n\n\nThe *Harry Potter* series has been used as a source of object lessons in educational techniques, sociological analysis and marketing.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nHarry Potter lives with his abusive uncle and aunt, Vernon and Petunia Dursley, and their bullying son, Dudley. On Harry's eleventh birthday, Rubeus Hagrid, a half-giant, delivers an acceptance letter from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, revealing that Harry's parents, James and Lily Potter, were wizards. When Harry was just a year old, a powerful but malevolent dark wizard named Lord Voldemort murdered his parents; Harry survived Voldemort's killing curse that rebounded and seemingly destroyed the Dark Lord, leaving a lightning bolt-shaped scar on his forehead. Unknown to Harry, this act made him famous in the wizarding world.\n\n\nHagrid escorts Harry to Diagon Alley, the hidden wizard commerce and retail section in London. Harry's parents have left him a fortune kept in Gringotts Wizarding Bank, which he uses to buy school supplies and a wand from Ollivander's. The cores of Harry and Lord Voldemort's wands have feathers from the same phoenix bird, making them \"brothers\". Hagrid gifts Harry an owl, whom he names as Hedwig, as a birthday present. A month later, Harry boards the Hogwarts Express at King's Cross railway station's secret Platform 9+3⁄4. En route to Hogwarts, Harry befriends fellow first year Ron Weasley and meets Hermione Granger, whom the two boys initially dislike.\n\n\nHarry runs afoul of Draco Malfoy, the spoiled son of a prominent wizard. At Hogwarts, a magical Sorting Hat sorts the first years among four school Houses (Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin) that best suit their personalities and talents. Draco joins Slytherin, known for producing dark wizards, while Harry, Ron, and Hermione are sorted into Gryffindor.\n\n\nHarry's broomstick flying ability earns him a place on the Gryffindor Quidditch team as the Seeker. Harry comes to dislike Potions master Severus Snape, who favours Slytherin while seeking to fail Harry. Malfoy tricks Harry and Ron into risking expulsion by leaving their common room after curfew. Hermione, unable to stop them, tags along. Realising Malfoy's ruse, they hide in a forbidden corridor and discover a gigantic three-headed dog guarding a trapdoor. Harry and Ron later save Hermione from a troll during a Halloween celebration and the three become best friends. Coupled with Snape's recent leg injury and suspicious behaviour, Harry, Ron, and Hermione believe he is attempting to enter the trapdoor.\n\n\nDuring Harry's first Quidditch match, his broomstick attempts to buck him off. Snape's strange behaviour during the match convinces Hermione he jinxed Harry's broom. Harry receives an anonymous Christmas gift – his father's invisibility cloak. Using it to explore the school, he discovers the Mirror of Erised, which shows what the viewer most desires. Harry sees his parents.\n\n\nA newspaper report later describes an attempted robbery at the same vault in Gringotts from which Hagrid retrieved an item for Hogwarts' headmaster Albus Dumbledore on the same day. The object beneath the trapdoor is the philosopher's stone, which grants its user immortality and the ability to turn any metal into pure gold. Firenze, a forest centaur, warns Harry that Voldemort is plotting to steal the stone to restore his body. When Dumbledore is lured from Hogwarts under false pretences, Harry, Hermione, and Ron fear the theft is imminent and descend through the trapdoor.\n\n\nVarious obstacles force Ron and Hermione to remain behind while Harry proceeds. Harry encounters Professor Quirrell, the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. He jinxed Harry's broom and let the troll into the school; Snape was protecting Harry. Voldemort, whose face has regrown on the back of Quirrell's head, is revealed to be the professor's secret master. Harry is forced to stand before the Mirror of Erised. It recognises Harry's lack of greed for the stone and deposits it into his pocket. Quirrell attempts to seize the stone, but his flesh burns upon contact with Harry. Harry's scar begins hurting, and he passes out.\n\n\nHarry awakens in the school's infirmary. He survived Voldemort because his mother sacrificing her life for him left a magical protective charm. Quirrell's hatred and greed caused him to burn upon contact with Harry; Voldemort abandoned him to die. Dumbledore reveals he sent Harry the invisibility cloak, while the philosopher's stone, that had been keeping the long-lived Nicolas Flamel alive, has been destroyed with Flamel's consent to prevent its being stolen. During the school's year-end feast, Gryffindor is awarded the House Cup. Harry returns to the Dursleys at Privet Drive until the next school year.\n\n\n\n## Characters[edit]\n\n\n* Harry Potter is an orphan whom Rowling imagined as a \"scrawny, black-haired, green eyed and bespectacled boy who didn't know he was a wizard.\"[3] She developed the series' story and characters to explain how Harry came to be in this situation and how his life unfolded from there.[4] Apart from the first chapter, the events of this book take place just before and in the year following Harry's eleventh birthday. Voldemort's attack left a lightning bolt-shaped scar on Harry's forehead,[4] which produces stabbing pains whenever Voldemort is present. Harry has a natural talent for Quidditch and became the first person in a century to get on their team in their first year.\n* Ron Weasley is Harry's age, and Rowling describes him as the ultimate best friend \"always there when you need him\".[5] He is freckled, red-haired, and quite tall. He grew up in a fairly large pure-blood family as the sixth born of seven children. Although his family is quite poor, they still live comfortably and happily. His loyalty and bravery in the face of a game of Wizards Chess plays a vital part in finding the Philosopher's Stone.\n* Hermione Granger, the daughter of an all-Muggle family, is a bossy girl who has apparently memorised most of the textbooks before the start of term. Rowling described Hermione as a \"very logical, upright and good\" character with \"a lot of insecurity and a great fear of failure beneath her swottiness\".[6] Despite her nagging efforts to keep Harry and Ron out of trouble, she becomes a close friend of the two boys after they save her from a troll and her magical and analytical skills play an important role in finding the Philosopher's Stone. She has bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth.\n* Neville Longbottom is a plump, diffident boy, so forgetful that his grandmother gives him a Remembrall, to remind him if he forgets something. Neville's magical abilities are weak and appeared just in time to save his life when he was eight. Despite his timidity, Neville will fight anyone after some encouragement or if he thinks it is right and important.\n* Rubeus Hagrid, a half-giant nearly 12 feet (3.7 m) tall, with tangled black hair and beard, was expelled from Hogwarts and his wand was snapped in half (resulting in him never to use a wand again), however Professor Dumbledore let him stay on as the school's gamekeeper, a job which enables him to give lavish affection, care and even pet names (such as Norbert the dragon) on even the most dangerous of magical creatures. Hagrid is fiercely loyal to Dumbledore and quickly becomes a close friend of Harry, Ron and, later, Hermione, but his carelessness makes him unreliable.\n* Professor Albus Dumbledore, a tall, thin man who wears half-moon spectacles and has silver hair and a beard that tucks into his belt, is the headmaster of Hogwarts, and thought to be the only wizard Voldemort fears. Dumbledore, while renowned for his achievements in magic, shrugs off praise, though he is aware of his own brilliance. Rowling described him as the \"epitome of goodness\".[7]\n* Professor Minerva McGonagall, a tall, severe-looking woman with black hair tied in a tight bun, teaches Transfiguration and is able to transform herself into a cat. She is Deputy Headmistress and Head of Gryffindor House.\n* Petunia Dursley, the sister of Harry's mother Lily, is a thin woman with a long neck that she uses for spying on the neighbours. As a Muggle, she regards her magical sister as a freak and tries to pretend that she never existed.\n* Vernon Dursley, the husband of Petunia Dursley, is a heavily built man whose irascible bluster covers a narrow mind and a fear of anything unusual.\n* Dudley Dursley is an overweight, spoilt bully and Harry's cousin.\n* Draco Malfoy is a slim, pale boy who speaks in a bored drawl. He is arrogant about his skill in Quidditch, and despises anyone who is not a pure-blood wizard  and wizards who do not share his views. His parents had supported Voldemort, but changed sides after the dark wizard's disappearance, claiming they had been bewitched. Draco avoids direct confrontations and tries to get Harry and his friends into trouble.\n* Oliver Wood is Harry's Quidditch captain and keeper for the Gryffindor Quidditch team.\n* Professor Quirrell is a twitching, stammering, and nervous man who teaches Defence Against the Dark Arts. Reputedly he was a brilliant scholar, but his nerve was shattered by an encounter with vampires. Quirrell wears a turban to conceal the fact that he is voluntarily possessed by Voldemort, whose face appears on the back of Quirrell's head.\n* Professor Severus Snape, who has a hooked nose, sallow complexion, and greasy black hair, teaches Potions, but would prefer to teach Defence Against the Dark Arts. Snape favours pupils in Slytherin, his own House and seizes every opportunity to humiliate others, especially Harry. Several incidents, beginning with the shooting pain in Harry's scar during the start-of-term feast, lead Harry and his friends to think Snape is aiding Voldemort.\n* Argus Filch, the school caretaker who knows the school's secret passages better than anyone else except, perhaps, the Weasley twins. His cat, Mrs. Norris, aids his constant hunt for misbehaving pupils.\n\n\nOther members of staff include: the dumpy Herbology teacher and Head of Hufflepuff House Professor Sprout, Professor Flitwick, the tiny and excitable Charms teacher and Head of Ravenclaw House, the soporific History of Magic teacher, Professor Binns, a ghost who does not seem to have noticed his own death, and Madam Hooch, the Quidditch coach, who is strict, but a considerate and methodical teacher. The poltergeist Peeves wanders around the castle causing trouble wherever he can.\n\n\nIn the book, Rowling introduces an eclectic cast of characters. The first character to be introduced is Vernon Dursley, Harry's uncle. Most of the actions centre on the eponymous hero [Harry Potter, an orphan who escapes his miserable childhood with the Dursley family. Rowling imagined him as a \"scrawny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who didn't know he was a wizard\"[3] and says she transferred part of her pain about losing her mother to him.[8] During the book, Harry makes two close friends, Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger. Ron is described by Rowling as the ultimate best friend, \"always there when you need him\".[5] Rowling has described Hermione as a \"very logical, upright and good\" character with \"a lot of insecurity and a great fear of failure beneath her swottiness\".[6]\n\n\nRowling also imagined a supporting cast of adults. The headmaster of Hogwarts is the powerful, but kind wizard Albus Dumbledore, who becomes Harry's confidant. Rowling described him as \"the epitome of goodness\".[7] His right hand is severe Minerva McGonagall, the friendly half-giant Rubeus Hagrid, who saved Harry from the Dursley family and the sinister Severus Snape. Professor Quirrell is also featured in the novel.\n\n\nThe main antagonists are Draco Malfoy, an elitist, bullying classmate,[9] and Lord Voldemort, the most powerful evil wizard who becomes disembodied when he tries to kill baby Harry. According to a 1999 interview with Rowling, the character of Voldemort was created as a literary foil for Harry and his backstory was intentionally not fleshed-out at first:\n\n\n\n\n> The basic idea... Harry, I saw Harry very very very clearly. Very vividly. And I knew he didn't know he was a wizard. ... And so then I kind of worked backwards from that position to find out how that could be, that he wouldn't know what he was. ... When he was one year old, the most evil wizard for hundreds and hundreds of years attempted to kill him. He killed Harry's parents, and then he tried to kill Harry—he tried to curse him. ... And—so—but for some mysterious reason, the curse didn't work on Harry. So he's left with this lightning bolt shaped scar on his forehead and the curse rebounded upon the evil wizard, who has been in hiding ever since.[4]\n> \n> \n\n\n## Development, publication and reception[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\nThe book, which was Rowling's debut novel, was written between approximately June 1990 and some time in 1995. In 1990, Jo Rowling, as she preferred to be known,[a] wanted to move with her boyfriend to a flat in Manchester and in her words, \"One weekend after flat hunting, I took the train back to London on my own and the idea for Harry Potter fell into my head... A scrawny, little, black-haired, bespectacled boy became more and more of a wizard to me... I began to write *Philosopher's Stone* that very evening. Although, the first couple of pages look nothing like the finished product.\"[8] Then, Rowling's mother died and, to cope with her pain, Rowling transferred her own anguish to the orphan Harry.[8] Rowling spent six years working on *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* and after it was accepted by Bloomsbury, she obtained a grant of £8,000 from the Scottish Arts Council, which enabled her to plan the sequels.[13] She sent the book to an literary agent and a publisher and then the second agent she approached spent a year trying to sell the book to publishers, most of whom thought it was too long at about 90,000 words. Barry Cunningham, who was building a portfolio of distinctive fantasies by new authors for Bloomsbury Children's Books, recommended accepting the book[14] and the eight-year-old daughter of Bloomsbury's chief executive said it was \"so much better than anything else\".[15]\n\n\n\n### Publication and reception in the United Kingdom[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Imitation of the fictional Platform 9+3⁄4 at the real King's Cross railway station, with a luggage trolley apparently halfway through the magical wall\nBloomsbury accepted the book, paying Rowling a £2,500 advance[16] and Cunningham sent proof copies to carefully chosen authors, critics and booksellers in order to obtain comments that could be quoted when the book was launched.[14] He was less concerned about the book's length than about its author's name, since the title sounded like a boys' book to him and he believed boys preferred books by male authors. Rowling therefore adopted the pen name J. K. Rowling just before publication.[14]\n\n\nIn June 1997, Bloomsbury published *Philosopher's Stone* with an initial print run of 500 copies in hardback, three hundred of which were distributed to libraries.[17] Her original name, \"Joanne Rowling\", can be found on the copyright page of all British editions until September 1999. (The 1998 first American edition would remove reference to \"Joanne\" completely.)[18] The short initial print run was standard for first novels and Cunningham hoped booksellers would read the book and recommend it to customers.[14] Examples from this initial print run have sold for as much as US$471,000 in a 2021 Heritage auction.[19] Thomas Taylor created the cover for the first edition.[14]\n\n\nLindsey Fraser, who had previously supplied one of the blurb comments,[14] wrote what is thought to be the first published review, in *The Scotsman* on 28 June 1997. She described *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* as \"a hugely entertaining thriller\" and Rowling as \"a first-rate writer for children\".[14][20] Another early review, in *The Herald*, said: \"I have yet to find a child who can put it down.\" Newspapers outside Scotland started to notice the book, with glowing reviews in *The Guardian* and *The Sunday Times* and in September 1997 *Books for Keeps*, a magazine that specialised in children's books, gave the novel four stars out of five.[14] *Sunday Times* said:\"comparisons to Dahl are, this time, justified\", while *The Guardian* called it \"a richly textured novel given lift-off by an inventive wit\" and *The Scotsman* said it had \"all the makings of a classic\".[14]\n\n\nIn 1997 the UK edition won a National Book Award and a gold medal in the 9- to 11-year-olds category of the Nestlé Smarties Book Prize.[21] The *Smarties* award, which is voted for by children, made the book well known within six months of publication, while most children's books have to wait for years.[14] The following year, *Philosopher's Stone* won almost all the other major British awards that were decided by children.[14][b] It was also shortlisted for children's books awards adjudicated by adults,[22] but did not win. Sandra Beckett commented that books that were popular with children were regarded as undemanding and as not of the highest literary standards – for example, the literary establishment disdained the works of Dahl, an overwhelming favourite of children before the appearance of Rowling's books.[23] In 2003, the novel was listed at number 22 on the BBC's survey The Big Read.[24]\n\n\n*Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* won two publishing industry awards given for sales rather than literary merit, the British Book Awards Children's Book of the Year and the Booksellers' Association / *Bookseller* Author of the Year.[14] By March 1999 UK editions had sold just over 300,000 copies[25] and the story was still the UK's best-selling title in December 2001.[26] A Braille edition was published in May 1998 by the Scottish Braille Press.[27]\n\n\nPlatform 9+3⁄4, from which the Hogwarts Express left London, was commemorated in the real-life King's Cross railway station with a sign and a trolley apparently passing through the wall.[28]\n\n\n\n\n### US publication and reception[edit]\n\n\n\n\nUK to American translation examples[29][30]\n| UK | American\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| mum, mam | mom\n |\n| sherbet lemon | lemon drop |\n| motorbike | motorcycle\n |\n| chips | fries\n |\n| crisp | chip\n |\n| jelly | Jell-O |\n| jacket potato | baked potato\n |\n| jumper | sweater\n |\n\n\nScholastic Corporation bought the US rights at the Bologna Book Fair in April 1997 for US$105,000, an unusually high sum for a children's book.[14] Scholastic's Arthur Levine thought that \"philosopher\" sounded too archaic for readers[31] and after some discussion (including the proposed title \"Harry Potter and the School of Magic\"[32]), the American edition was published in September 1998[33] under the title Rowling suggested, *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone*.[14] Rowling later said that she regretted this change and would have fought it if she had been in a stronger position at the time.[10] Philip Nel has pointed out that the change lost the connection with alchemy and the meaning of some other terms changed in translation, for example from \"crumpet\" to \"muffin\". While Rowling accepted the change from both the British English \"mum\" and Seamus Finnigan's Irish variant \"mam\" to the American variant \"mom\" in *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone*, she vetoed this change in the later books, which was then reversed in later editions of *Philosopher's Stone*. However, Nel considered that Scholastic's translations were considerably more sensitive than most of those imposed on British English books of the time and that some other changes could be regarded as useful copyedits.[29] Since the UK editions of early titles in the series were published months prior to the American versions, some American readers became familiar with the British English versions owing to having bought them from online retailers.[34]\n\n\nAt first the most prestigious reviewers ignored the book, leaving it to book trade and library publications such as *Kirkus Reviews* and *Booklist*, which examined it only by the entertainment-oriented criteria of children's fiction. However, more penetrating specialist reviews (such as one by *Cooperative Children's Book Center Choices*, which noted complexity, depth and consistency in the world that Rowling had built) attracted the attention of reviewers in major newspapers.[35] Although *The Boston Globe* and Michael Winerip in *The New York Times* complained that the final chapters were the weakest part of the book,[20][36] they and most other American reviewers gave glowing praise.[14][20]\nA year later, the US edition was selected as an American Library Association Notable Book, a *Publishers Weekly* Best Book of 1998 and a New York Public Library 1998 Best Book of the Year and won *Parenting Magazine*'s Book of the Year Award for 1998,[21] the *School Library Journal* Best Book of the Year and the American Library Association Best Book for Young Adults.[14] In 2012 it was ranked number 3 on a list of the top 100 children's novels published by *School Library Journal*.[37]\n\n\nIn August 1999, *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* topped the *New York Times* list of best-selling fiction[38] and stayed near the top of the list for much of 1999 and 2000, until the *New York Times* split its list into children's and adult sections under pressure from other publishers who were eager to see their books given higher placings.[23][35] *Publishers Weekly*'s report in December 2001 on cumulative sales of children's fiction placed *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* 19th among hardbacks (over 5 million copies) and 7th among paperbacks (over 6.6 million copies).[39]\n\n\nIn May 2008, Scholastic announced the creation of a 10th Anniversary Edition of the book[40] that was released on 1 October 2008[41] to mark the tenth anniversary of the original American release.[40] For the fifteenth anniversary of the books, Scholastic re-released *Sorcerer's Stone*, along with the other six novels in the series, with new cover art by Kazu Kibuishi in 2013.[42][43][44]\n\n\n\n### Translations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Harry Potter in translation\n\nBy mid-2008, official translations of the book had been published in 67 languages.[45][46] By November 2017, the book had been translated into 80 languages, the 80th being Lowland Scots.[47] Bloomsbury have published translations in Latin and in Ancient Greek,[48][49] with the latter being described as \"one of the most important pieces of Ancient Greek prose written in many centuries\".[50]\n\n\n\n## Style and themes[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Harry Potter influences and analogues\n\nPhilip Nel highlighted the influence of Jane Austen, whom Rowling has greatly admired since the age of twelve. Both novelists greatly encourage re-reading, because details that look insignificant foreshadow important events or characters much later in the story-line – for example Sirius Black is briefly mentioned near the beginning of *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*, and then becomes a major character in the third to fifth books. Like Austen's heroines, Harry often has to re-examine his ideas near the ends of books. Some social behaviour in the *Harry Potter* books is reminiscent of Austen, for example the excited communal reading of letters. Both authors satirise social behaviour and give characters names that express their personalities. However, in Nel's opinion Rowling's humour is more based on caricature and the names she invents are more like those found in Charles Dickens's stories,[20]: 13–15 and Amanda Cockrell noted that many of these express their owners' traits through allusions that run from ancient Roman mythology to eighteenth-century German literature.[51] Rowling, like the Narnia series' author C. S. Lewis, thinks there is no rigid distinction between stories for children and for adults. Nel also noted that, like many good writers for children, Rowling combines literary genres‍—‌fantasy, young adult fiction, boarding school stories, *Bildungsroman* and many others.[20]: 51–52\n\n\nSome reviewers compared *Philosopher's Stone* to the stories of Roald Dahl, who died in 1990. Many writers since the 1970s had been hailed as his successor, but none had attained anything near his popularity with children and, in a poll conducted shortly after the launch of *Philosopher's Stone*, seven of the ten most popular children's books were by Dahl, including the one in top place. The only other really popular children's author of the late 1990s was an American, R. L. Stine. Some of the story elements in *Philosopher's Stone* resembled parts of Dahl's stories. For example, the hero of *James and the Giant Peach* lost his parents and had to live with a pair of unpleasant aunts‍—‌one fat and one thin rather like Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, who treated Harry as a servant. However Harry Potter was a distinctive creation, able to take on the responsibilities of an adult while remaining a child inside.[14]\n\n\nLibrarian Nancy Knapp and marketing professor Stephen Brown noted the liveliness and detail of descriptions, especially of shop scenes such as Diagon Alley.[21][52] Tad Brennan commented that Rowling's writing resembles that of Homer: \"rapid, plain, and direct in expression\".[50] Stephen King admired \"the sort of playful details of which only British fantasists seem capable\" and concluded that they worked because Rowling enjoys a quick giggle and then moves briskly forward.[53]\n\n\nNicholas Tucker described the early *Harry Potter* books as looking back to Victorian and Edwardian children's stories: Hogwarts was an old-style boarding school in which the teachers addressed pupils formally by their surnames and were most concerned with the reputations of the houses with which they were associated; characters' personalities were plainly shown by their appearances, starting with the Dursleys; evil or malicious characters were to be crushed rather than reformed, including Argus Filch's cat Mrs Norris; and the hero, a mistreated orphan who found his true place in life, was charismatic and good at sports, but considerate and protective towards the weak.[54] Several other commentators have stated that the books present a highly stratified society including many social stereotypes.[55] However Karin Westerman drew parallels with 1990s Britain: a class system that was breaking down but defended by those whose power and status it upheld; the multi-ethnic composition of Hogwarts' students; the racial tensions between the various intelligent species; and school bullying.[56]\n\n\nSusan Hall wrote that there is no rule of law in the books, as the actions of Ministry of Magic officials are unconstrained by laws, accountability or any kind of legal challenge. This provides an opportunity for Voldemort to offer his own horrific version of order. As a side-effect Harry and Hermione, who were brought up in the highly regulated Muggle world, find solutions by thinking in ways unfamiliar to wizards. For example, Hermione notes that one obstacle to finding the Philosopher's Stone is a test of logic rather than magical power, and that most wizards have no chance of solving it.[57]\n\n\nNel suggested that the unflattering characterisation of the extremely conventional, status-conscious, materialistic Dursleys was Rowling's reaction to the family policies of the British government in the early 1990s, which treated the married heterosexual couple as the \"preferred norm\", while the author was a single mother. Harry's relationships with adult and juvenile wizards are based on affection and loyalty. This is reflected in his happiness whenever he is a temporary member of the Weasley family throughout the series, and in his treatment of first Rubeus Hagrid and later Remus Lupin and Sirius Black as father-figures.[20]: 13–15, 47–48[51]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n### Sequels[edit]\n\n\nThe second book, *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*, was originally published in the UK on 2 July 1998 and later, in the US on 2 June 1999.[58][59] *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban* was then published a year later in the UK on 8 July 1999 and in the US on 8 September 1999.[58][59] *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire* was published on 8 July 2000 at the same time by Bloomsbury and Scholastic.[60] *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix* is the longest book in the series at 766 pages in the UK version and 870 pages in the US version.[61] It was published worldwide in English on 21 June 2003.[62] *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince* was published on 16 July 2005 and sold 11 million copies in the first 24 hours of its worldwide release.[63][64] The seventh and final novel, *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*, was published on 21 July 2007.[65] The book sold 11 million copies within 24 hours of its release: 2.7 million copies in the UK and 8.3 million in the US.[66]\n\n\n\n### Illustrated version[edit]\n\n\nAn illustrated version of *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* was released on 6 October 2015, with illustrations by Jim Kay.[67][68] The book carries over 100 illustrations and will be followed by illustrated versions of all seven books from the series by the same artist.\n\n\n\n### Podcast version[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2020, a reading podcast by Spotify was created and entitled *Harry Potter at Home: Readings*. Each chapter is narrated by a celebrity guest from the *Harry Potter* and *Wizarding World* franchises.[69]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Chapter | Title | Release date | Runtime | Narrated by\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | *The Boy Who Lived* | 5 May 2020 | 25 mins, 54 secs | Daniel Radcliffe |\n| 2 | *The Vanishing Glass* | 8 May 2020 | 27 mins, 27 secs | Noma Dumezweni |\n| 3 | *The Letters from No One* | 12 May 2020 | 26 mins, 14 secs | Eddie Redmayne |\n| 4 | *The Keeper of the Keys* | 14 May 2020 | 26 mins, 54 secs | Stephen Fry |\n| 5 | *Diagon Alley* | 19 May 2020 | 48 mins, 1 sec | Simon Callow, Bonnie Wright and Evanna Lynch |\n| 6 | *The Journey from Platform Nine and Three-Quarters* | 20 May 2020 | 41 mins, 47 secs | Jamie Parker and cast of *Harry Potter and the Cursed Child* |\n| 7 | *The Sorting Hat* | 27 May 2020 | 27 mins, 1 sec | Olivia Colman, Jonathan Van Ness and Kate McKinnon |\n| 8 | *The Potions Master* | 28 May 2020 | 18 mins, 36 secs | Alia Bhatt, Alec Baldwin and Carmen Baldwin\n |\n| 9 | *Midnight Duel* | 3 June 2020 | 33 mins, 21 secs | Alison Sudol and Dan Fogler |\n| 10 | *Hallowe'en* | 4 June 2020 | 29 mins, 06 secs | Whoopi Goldberg |\n| 11 | *Quidditch* | 10 June 2020 | 22 mins, 27 secs | David Tennant and David Beckham |\n| 12 | *The Mirror of Erised* | 3 July 2020 | 39 mins, 14 secs | Matthew Lewis, Helen Howard and Imelda Staunton |\n| 13 | *Nicolas Flamel* | 7 July 2020 | 22 mins, 2 secs | Hugh Bonneville |\n| 14 | *Norbert the Norwegian Ridgeback* | 8 July 2020 | 26 mins, 6 secs | Jason Isaacs, Tom Felton and Helen McCrory |\n| 15 | *The Forbidden Forest* | 13 July 2020 | 33 mins, 3 secs | Claudia Kim and Dakota Fanning |\n| 16 | *Through the Trapdoor* | 14 July 2020 | 51 mins, 35 secs | Kenneth Branagh, Ruth Wilson and Helena Bonham Carter |\n| 17 | *The Man with the Two Faces* | 16 July 2020 | 41 mins, 29 secs | Three families of *Harry Potter* fans, with a surprise appearance from J. K.

Writing about clinical teaching in medical schools, Jennifer Conn contrasted Snape's technical expertise with his intimidating behaviour towards students. Quidditch coach Madam Hooch on the other hand, illustrated useful techniques in the teaching of physical skills, including breaking down complex actions into sequences of simple ones and helping students to avoid common errors.[93] Joyce Fields wrote that the books illustrate four of the five main topics in a typical first-year sociology class: \"sociological concepts including culture, society, and socialisation; stratification and social inequality; social institutions; and social theory\".[55]\n\n\nStephen Brown noted that the early *Harry Potter* books, especially *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*, were a runaway success despite inadequate and poorly organised marketing. Brown advised marketing executives to be less preoccupied with rigorous statistical analyses and the \"analysis, planning, implementation, and control\" model of management. Instead he recommended that they should treat the stories as \"a marketing masterclass\", full of enticing products and brand names.[52] For example, a real-world analogue of Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans was introduced under licence in 2000 by toymaker Hasbro.[52][94]\n\n\n\n## Release history[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Country\n | Release date\n | Edition(Hardback/Paperback) | Publisher\n | Pages\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| United Kingdom\n | 26 June 1997[95][96] | Hardback Children's Edition\n | Bloomsbury | 223\n |\n| Paperback Children's Edition\n |\n| 11 September 1998[97] | Paperback Adult Edition (Original) |\n| 27 September 1999[98] | Hardback Signature Special Edition\n |\n| 8 October 2001[99] | Paperback Special Edition\n |\n| 10 July 2004[100] | Hardback Adult Edition (Re-issue with new cover) | 336\n |\n| 4 October 2004[101] | Paperback Adult Edition (Re-issue with new cover) | 223\n |\n| 1 November 2010[102] | Paperback Harry Potter Signature Edition\n |\n| 18 July 2013[103] | Paperback Adult Edition (Re-issue with new cover) |\n| 1 September 2014[104][105] | Hardcover Children's Edition (Re-issue with new cover) | 352\n |\n| Paperback Children's Edition (Re-issue with new cover) |\n| 6 October 2015[106] | Hardcover Illustrated Edition (Illustrated by Jim Kay) | 256\n |\n| 20 October 2020[107] | MinaLima Edition\n | 368\n |\n| 9 June 2022[108] | Hardcover Children's Edition (25th Anniversary Edition) | 352\n |\n| United States\n | 1 September 1998[109] | Hardback\n | Arthur A.

K. Rowling. The first novel in the *Harry Potter* series and Rowling's debut novel, it follows Harry Potter, a young wizard who discovers his magical heritage on his eleventh birthday, when he receives a letter of acceptance to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry makes close friends and a few enemies during his first year at the school and with the help of his friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, he faces an attempted comeback by the dark wizard Lord Voldemort, who killed Harry's parents, but failed to kill Harry when he was just 15 months old.\n\n\nThe book was first published in the United Kingdom on 26 June 1997 by Bloomsbury. It was published in the United States the following year by Scholastic Corporation under the title ***Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone***. It won most of the British book awards that were judged by children and other awards in the US. The book reached the top of the *New York Times* list of best-selling fiction in August 1999 and stayed near the top of that list for much of 1999 and 2000. It has been translated into at least 73 other languages and has been made into a feature-length film of the same name, as have all six of its sequels. The novel has sold in excess of 120 million copies, making it the fourth best-selling book of all time.[1][2]\n\n\nMost reviews were very favourable, commenting on Rowling's imagination, humour, simple, direct style and clever plot construction, although a few complained that the final chapters seemed rushed. The writing has been compared to that of Jane Austen, one of Rowling's favourite authors; Roald Dahl, whose works dominated children's stories before the appearance of Harry Potter; and the ancient Greek story-teller Homer. While some commentators thought the book looked backwards to Victorian and Edwardian boarding school stories, others thought it placed the genre firmly in the modern world by featuring contemporary ethical and social issues, as well as overcoming obstacles like bullying.\n\n\nThe *Harry Potter* series has been used as a source of object lessons in educational techniques, sociological analysis and marketing.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nHarry Potter lives with his abusive uncle and aunt, Vernon and Petunia Dursley, and their bullying son, Dudley. On Harry's eleventh birthday, Rubeus Hagrid, a half-giant, delivers an acceptance letter from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, revealing that Harry's parents, James and Lily Potter, were wizards. When Harry was just a year old, a powerful but malevolent dark wizard named Lord Voldemort murdered his parents; Harry survived Voldemort's killing curse that rebounded and seemingly destroyed the Dark Lord, leaving a lightning bolt-shaped scar on his forehead. Unknown to Harry, this act made him famous in the wizarding world.\n\n\nHagrid escorts Harry to Diagon Alley, the hidden wizard commerce and retail section in London. Harry's parents have left him a fortune kept in Gringotts Wizarding Bank, which he uses to buy school supplies and a wand from Ollivander's. The cores of Harry and Lord Voldemort's wands have feathers from the same phoenix bird, making them \"brothers\". Hagrid gifts Harry an owl, whom he names as Hedwig, as a birthday present. A month later, Harry boards the Hogwarts Express at King's Cross railway station's secret Platform 9+3⁄4. En route to Hogwarts, Harry befriends fellow first year Ron Weasley and meets Hermione Granger, whom the two boys initially dislike.\n\n\nHarry runs afoul of Draco Malfoy, the spoiled son of a prominent wizard. At Hogwarts, a magical Sorting Hat sorts the first years among four school Houses (Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin) that best suit their personalities and talents. Draco joins Slytherin, known for producing dark wizards, while Harry, Ron, and Hermione are sorted into Gryffindor.\n\n\nHarry's broomstick flying ability earns him a place on the Gryffindor Quidditch team as the Seeker. Harry comes to dislike Potions master Severus Snape, who favours Slytherin while seeking to fail Harry. Malfoy tricks Harry and Ron into risking expulsion by leaving their common room after curfew. Hermione, unable to stop them, tags along. Realising Malfoy's ruse, they hide in a forbidden corridor and discover a gigantic three-headed dog guarding a trapdoor. Harry and Ron later save Hermione from a troll during a Halloween celebration and the three become best friends. Coupled with Snape's recent leg injury and suspicious behaviour, Harry, Ron, and Hermione believe he is attempting to enter the trapdoor.\n\n\nDuring Harry's first Quidditch match, his broomstick attempts to buck him off. Snape's strange behaviour during the match convinces Hermione he jinxed Harry's broom. Harry receives an anonymous Christmas gift – his father's invisibility cloak. Using it to explore the school, he discovers the Mirror of Erised, which shows what the viewer most desires. Harry sees his parents.\n\n\nA newspaper report later describes an attempted robbery at the same vault in Gringotts from which Hagrid retrieved an item for Hogwarts' headmaster Albus Dumbledore on the same day. The object beneath the trapdoor is the philosopher's stone, which grants its user immortality and the ability to turn any metal into pure gold. Firenze, a forest centaur, warns Harry that Voldemort is plotting to steal the stone to restore his body. When Dumbledore is lured from Hogwarts under false pretences, Harry, Hermione, and Ron fear the theft is imminent and descend through the trapdoor.\n\n\nVarious obstacles force Ron and Hermione to remain behind while Harry proceeds. Harry encounters Professor Quirrell, the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. He jinxed Harry's broom and let the troll into the school; Snape was protecting Harry. Voldemort, whose face has regrown on the back of Quirrell's head, is revealed to be the professor's secret master. Harry is forced to stand before the Mirror of Erised. It recognises Harry's lack of greed for the stone and deposits it into his pocket. Quirrell attempts to seize the stone, but his flesh burns upon contact with Harry. Harry's scar begins hurting, and he passes out.\n\n\nHarry awakens in the school's infirmary. He survived Voldemort because his mother sacrificing her life for him left a magical protective charm. Quirrell's hatred and greed caused him to burn upon contact with Harry; Voldemort abandoned him to die. Dumbledore reveals he sent Harry the invisibility cloak, while the philosopher's stone, that had been keeping the long-lived Nicolas Flamel alive, has been destroyed with Flamel's consent to prevent its being stolen. During the school's year-end feast, Gryffindor is awarded the House Cup. Harry returns to the Dursleys at Privet Drive until the next school year.\n\n\n\n## Characters[edit]\n\n\n* Harry Potter is an orphan whom Rowling imagined as a \"scrawny, black-haired, green eyed and bespectacled boy who didn't know he was a wizard.\"[3] She developed the series' story and characters to explain how Harry came to be in this situation and how his life unfolded from there.[4] Apart from the first chapter, the events of this book take place just before and in the year following Harry's eleventh birthday. Voldemort's attack left a lightning bolt-shaped scar on Harry's forehead,[4] which produces stabbing pains whenever Voldemort is present. Harry has a natural talent for Quidditch and became the first person in a century to get on their team in their first year.\n* Ron Weasley is Harry's age, and Rowling describes him as the ultimate best friend \"always there when you need him\".[5] He is freckled, red-haired, and quite tall. He grew up in a fairly large pure-blood family as the sixth born of seven children. Although his family is quite poor, they still live comfortably and happily. His loyalty and bravery in the face of a game of Wizards Chess plays a vital part in finding the Philosopher's Stone.\n* Hermione Granger, the daughter of an all-Muggle family, is a bossy girl who has apparently memorised most of the textbooks before the start of term. Rowling described Hermione as a \"very logical, upright and good\" character with \"a lot of insecurity and a great fear of failure beneath her swottiness\".[6] Despite her nagging efforts to keep Harry and Ron out of trouble, she becomes a close friend of the two boys after they save her from a troll and her magical and analytical skills play an important role in finding the Philosopher's Stone. She has bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth.\n* Neville Longbottom is a plump, diffident boy, so forgetful that his grandmother gives him a Remembrall, to remind him if he forgets something. Neville's magical abilities are weak and appeared just in time to save his life when he was eight. Despite his timidity, Neville will fight anyone after some encouragement or if he thinks it is right and important.\n* Rubeus Hagrid, a half-giant nearly 12 feet (3.7 m) tall, with tangled black hair and beard, was expelled from Hogwarts and his wand was snapped in half (resulting in him never to use a wand again), however Professor Dumbledore let him stay on as the school's gamekeeper, a job which enables him to give lavish affection, care and even pet names (such as Norbert the dragon) on even the most dangerous of magical creatures. Hagrid is fiercely loyal to Dumbledore and quickly becomes a close friend of Harry, Ron and, later, Hermione, but his carelessness makes him unreliable.\n* Professor Albus Dumbledore, a tall, thin man who wears half-moon spectacles and has silver hair and a beard that tucks into his belt, is the headmaster of Hogwarts, and thought to be the only wizard Voldemort fears. Dumbledore, while renowned for his achievements in magic, shrugs off praise, though he is aware of his own brilliance. Rowling described him as the \"epitome of goodness\".[7]\n* Professor Minerva McGonagall, a tall, severe-looking woman with black hair tied in a tight bun, teaches Transfiguration and is able to transform herself into a cat. She is Deputy Headmistress and Head of Gryffindor House.\n* Petunia Dursley, the sister of Harry's mother Lily, is a thin woman with a long neck that she uses for spying on the neighbours. As a Muggle, she regards her magical sister as a freak and tries to pretend that she never existed.\n* Vernon Dursley, the husband of Petunia Dursley, is a heavily built man whose irascible bluster covers a narrow mind and a fear of anything unusual.\n* Dudley Dursley is an overweight, spoilt bully and Harry's cousin.\n* Draco Malfoy is a slim, pale boy who speaks in a bored drawl. He is arrogant about his skill in Quidditch, and despises anyone who is not a pure-blood wizard  and wizards who do not share his views. His parents had supported Voldemort, but changed sides after the dark wizard's disappearance, claiming they had been bewitched. Draco avoids direct confrontations and tries to get Harry and his friends into trouble.\n* Oliver Wood is Harry's Quidditch captain and keeper for the Gryffindor Quidditch team.\n* Professor Quirrell is a twitching, stammering, and nervous man who teaches Defence Against the Dark Arts. Reputedly he was a brilliant scholar, but his nerve was shattered by an encounter with vampires. Quirrell wears a turban to conceal the fact that he is voluntarily possessed by Voldemort, whose face appears on the back of Quirrell's head.\n* Professor Severus Snape, who has a hooked nose, sallow complexion, and greasy black hair, teaches Potions, but would prefer to teach Defence Against the Dark Arts. Snape favours pupils in Slytherin, his own House and seizes every opportunity to humiliate others, especially Harry. Several incidents, beginning with the shooting pain in Harry's scar during the start-of-term feast, lead Harry and his friends to think Snape is aiding Voldemort.\n* Argus Filch, the school caretaker who knows the school's secret passages better than anyone else except, perhaps, the Weasley twins. His cat, Mrs. Norris, aids his constant hunt for misbehaving pupils.\n\n\nOther members of staff include: the dumpy Herbology teacher and Head of Hufflepuff House Professor Sprout, Professor Flitwick, the tiny and excitable Charms teacher and Head of Ravenclaw House, the soporific History of Magic teacher, Professor Binns, a ghost who does not seem to have noticed his own death, and Madam Hooch, the Quidditch coach, who is strict, but a considerate and methodical teacher. The poltergeist Peeves wanders around the castle causing trouble wherever he can.\n\n\nIn the book, Rowling introduces an eclectic cast of characters. The first character to be introduced is Vernon Dursley, Harry's uncle. Most of the actions centre on the eponymous hero [Harry Potter, an orphan who escapes his miserable childhood with the Dursley family. Rowling imagined him as a \"scrawny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who didn't know he was a wizard\"[3] and says she transferred part of her pain about losing her mother to him.[8] During the book, Harry makes two close friends, Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger. Ron is described by Rowling as the ultimate best friend, \"always there when you need him\".[5] Rowling has described Hermione as a \"very logical, upright and good\" character with \"a lot of insecurity and a great fear of failure beneath her swottiness\".[6]\n\n\nRowling also imagined a supporting cast of adults. The headmaster of Hogwarts is the powerful, but kind wizard Albus Dumbledore, who becomes Harry's confidant. Rowling described him as \"the epitome of goodness\".[7] His right hand is severe Minerva McGonagall, the friendly half-giant Rubeus Hagrid, who saved Harry from the Dursley family and the sinister Severus Snape. Professor Quirrell is also featured in the novel.\n\n\nThe main antagonists are Draco Malfoy, an elitist, bullying classmate,[9] and Lord Voldemort, the most powerful evil wizard who becomes disembodied when he tries to kill baby Harry. According to a 1999 interview with Rowling, the character of Voldemort was created as a literary foil for Harry and his backstory was intentionally not fleshed-out at first:\n\n\n\n\n> The basic idea... Harry, I saw Harry very very very clearly. Very vividly. And I knew he didn't know he was a wizard. ... And so then I kind of worked backwards from that position to find out how that could be, that he wouldn't know what he was. ... When he was one year old, the most evil wizard for hundreds and hundreds of years attempted to kill him. He killed Harry's parents, and then he tried to kill Harry—he tried to curse him. ... And—so—but for some mysterious reason, the curse didn't work on Harry. So he's left with this lightning bolt shaped scar on his forehead and the curse rebounded upon the evil wizard, who has been in hiding ever since.[4]\n> \n> \n\n\n## Development, publication and reception[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\nThe book, which was Rowling's debut novel, was written between approximately June 1990 and some time in 1995. In 1990, Jo Rowling, as she preferred to be known,[a] wanted to move with her boyfriend to a flat in Manchester and in her words, \"One weekend after flat hunting, I took the train back to London on my own and the idea for Harry Potter fell into my head... A scrawny, little, black-haired, bespectacled boy became more and more of a wizard to me... I began to write *Philosopher's Stone* that very evening. Although, the first couple of pages look nothing like the finished product.\"[8] Then, Rowling's mother died and, to cope with her pain, Rowling transferred her own anguish to the orphan Harry.[8] Rowling spent six years working on *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* and after it was accepted by Bloomsbury, she obtained a grant of £8,000 from the Scottish Arts Council, which enabled her to plan the sequels.[13] She sent the book to an literary agent and a publisher and then the second agent she approached spent a year trying to sell the book to publishers, most of whom thought it was too long at about 90,000 words. Barry Cunningham, who was building a portfolio of distinctive fantasies by new authors for Bloomsbury Children's Books, recommended accepting the book[14] and the eight-year-old daughter of Bloomsbury's chief executive said it was \"so much better than anything else\".[15]\n\n\n\n### Publication and reception in the United Kingdom[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Imitation of the fictional Platform 9+3⁄4 at the real King's Cross railway station, with a luggage trolley apparently halfway through the magical wall\nBloomsbury accepted the book, paying Rowling a £2,500 advance[16] and Cunningham sent proof copies to carefully chosen authors, critics and booksellers in order to obtain comments that could be quoted when the book was launched.[14] He was less concerned about the book's length than about its author's name, since the title sounded like a boys' book to him and he believed boys preferred books by male authors. Rowling therefore adopted the pen name J. K. Rowling just before publication.[14]\n\n\nIn June 1997, Bloomsbury published *Philosopher's Stone* with an initial print run of 500 copies in hardback, three hundred of which were distributed to libraries.[17] Her original name, \"Joanne Rowling\", can be found on the copyright page of all British editions until September 1999. (The 1998 first American edition would remove reference to \"Joanne\" completely.)[18] The short initial print run was standard for first novels and Cunningham hoped booksellers would read the book and recommend it to customers.[14] Examples from this initial print run have sold for as much as US$471,000 in a 2021 Heritage auction.[19] Thomas Taylor created the cover for the first edition.[14]\n\n\nLindsey Fraser, who had previously supplied one of the blurb comments,[14] wrote what is thought to be the first published review, in *The Scotsman* on 28 June 1997. She described *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* as \"a hugely entertaining thriller\" and Rowling as \"a first-rate writer for children\".[14][20] Another early review, in *The Herald*, said: \"I have yet to find a child who can put it down.\" Newspapers outside Scotland started to notice the book, with glowing reviews in *The Guardian* and *The Sunday Times* and in September 1997 *Books for Keeps*, a magazine that specialised in children's books, gave the novel four stars out of five.[14] *Sunday Times* said:\"comparisons to Dahl are, this time, justified\", while *The Guardian* called it \"a richly textured novel given lift-off by an inventive wit\" and *The Scotsman* said it had \"all the makings of a classic\".[14]\n\n\nIn 1997 the UK edition won a National Book Award and a gold medal in the 9- to 11-year-olds category of the Nestlé Smarties Book Prize.[21] The *Smarties* award, which is voted for by children, made the book well known within six months of publication, while most children's books have to wait for years.[14] The following year, *Philosopher's Stone* won almost all the other major British awards that were decided by children.[14][b] It was also shortlisted for children's books awards adjudicated by adults,[22] but did not win. Sandra Beckett commented that books that were popular with children were regarded as undemanding and as not of the highest literary standards – for example, the literary establishment disdained the works of Dahl, an overwhelming favourite of children before the appearance of Rowling's books.[23] In 2003, the novel was listed at number 22 on the BBC's survey The Big Read.[24]\n\n\n*Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* won two publishing industry awards given for sales rather than literary merit, the British Book Awards Children's Book of the Year and the Booksellers' Association / *Bookseller* Author of the Year.[14] By March 1999 UK editions had sold just over 300,000 copies[25] and the story was still the UK's best-selling title in December 2001.[26] A Braille edition was published in May 1998 by the Scottish Braille Press.[27]\n\n\nPlatform 9+3⁄4, from which the Hogwarts Express left London, was commemorated in the real-life King's Cross railway station with a sign and a trolley apparently passing through the wall.[28]\n\n\n\n\n### US publication and reception[edit]\n\n\n\n\nUK to American translation examples[29][30]\n| UK | American\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| mum, mam | mom\n |\n| sherbet lemon | lemon drop |\n| motorbike | motorcycle\n |\n| chips | fries\n |\n| crisp | chip\n |\n| jelly | Jell-O |\n| jacket potato | baked potato\n |\n| jumper | sweater\n |\n\n\nScholastic Corporation bought the US rights at the Bologna Book Fair in April 1997 for US$105,000, an unusually high sum for a children's book.[14] Scholastic's Arthur Levine thought that \"philosopher\" sounded too archaic for readers[31] and after some discussion (including the proposed title \"Harry Potter and the School of Magic\"[32]), the American edition was published in September 1998[33] under the title Rowling suggested, *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone*.[14] Rowling later said that she regretted this change and would have fought it if she had been in a stronger position at the time.[10] Philip Nel has pointed out that the change lost the connection with alchemy and the meaning of some other terms changed in translation, for example from \"crumpet\" to \"muffin\". While Rowling accepted the change from both the British English \"mum\" and Seamus Finnigan's Irish variant \"mam\" to the American variant \"mom\" in *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone*, she vetoed this change in the later books, which was then reversed in later editions of *Philosopher's Stone*. However, Nel considered that Scholastic's translations were considerably more sensitive than most of those imposed on British English books of the time and that some other changes could be regarded as useful copyedits.[29] Since the UK editions of early titles in the series were published months prior to the American versions, some American readers became familiar with the British English versions owing to having bought them from online retailers.[34]\n\n\nAt first the most prestigious reviewers ignored the book, leaving it to book trade and library publications such as *Kirkus Reviews* and *Booklist*, which examined it only by the entertainment-oriented criteria of children's fiction. However, more penetrating specialist reviews (such as one by *Cooperative Children's Book Center Choices*, which noted complexity, depth and consistency in the world that Rowling had built) attracted the attention of reviewers in major newspapers.[35] Although *The Boston Globe* and Michael Winerip in *The New York Times* complained that the final chapters were the weakest part of the book,[20][36] they and most other American reviewers gave glowing praise.[14][20]\nA year later, the US edition was selected as an American Library Association Notable Book, a *Publishers Weekly* Best Book of 1998 and a New York Public Library 1998 Best Book of the Year and won *Parenting Magazine*'s Book of the Year Award for 1998,[21] the *School Library Journal* Best Book of the Year and the American Library Association Best Book for Young Adults.[14] In 2012 it was ranked number 3 on a list of the top 100 children's novels published by *School Library Journal*.[37]\n\n\nIn August 1999, *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* topped the *New York Times* list of best-selling fiction[38] and stayed near the top of the list for much of 1999 and 2000, until the *New York Times* split its list into children's and adult sections under pressure from other publishers who were eager to see their books given higher placings.[23][35] *Publishers Weekly*'s report in December 2001 on cumulative sales of children's fiction placed *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* 19th among hardbacks (over 5 million copies) and 7th among paperbacks (over 6.6 million copies).[39]\n\n\nIn May 2008, Scholastic announced the creation of a 10th Anniversary Edition of the book[40] that was released on 1 October 2008[41] to mark the tenth anniversary of the original American release.[40] For the fifteenth anniversary of the books, Scholastic re-released *Sorcerer's Stone*, along with the other six novels in the series, with new cover art by Kazu Kibuishi in 2013.[42][43][44]\n\n\n\n### Translations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Harry Potter in translation\n\nBy mid-2008, official translations of the book had been published in 67 languages.[45][46] By November 2017, the book had been translated into 80 languages, the 80th being Lowland Scots.[47] Bloomsbury have published translations in Latin and in Ancient Greek,[48][49] with the latter being described as \"one of the most important pieces of Ancient Greek prose written in many centuries\".[50]\n\n\n\n## Style and themes[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Harry Potter influences and analogues\n\nPhilip Nel highlighted the influence of Jane Austen, whom Rowling has greatly admired since the age of twelve. Both novelists greatly encourage re-reading, because details that look insignificant foreshadow important events or characters much later in the story-line – for example Sirius Black is briefly mentioned near the beginning of *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*, and then becomes a major character in the third to fifth books. Like Austen's heroines, Harry often has to re-examine his ideas near the ends of books. Some social behaviour in the *Harry Potter* books is reminiscent of Austen, for example the excited communal reading of letters. Both authors satirise social behaviour and give characters names that express their personalities. However, in Nel's opinion Rowling's humour is more based on caricature and the names she invents are more like those found in Charles Dickens's stories,[20]: 13–15 and Amanda Cockrell noted that many of these express their owners' traits through allusions that run from ancient Roman mythology to eighteenth-century German literature.[51] Rowling, like the Narnia series' author C. S. Lewis, thinks there is no rigid distinction between stories for children and for adults. Nel also noted that, like many good writers for children, Rowling combines literary genres‍—‌fantasy, young adult fiction, boarding school stories, *Bildungsroman* and many others.[20]: 51–52\n\n\nSome reviewers compared *Philosopher's Stone* to the stories of Roald Dahl, who died in 1990. Many writers since the 1970s had been hailed as his successor, but none had attained anything near his popularity with children and, in a poll conducted shortly after the launch of *Philosopher's Stone*, seven of the ten most popular children's books were by Dahl, including the one in top place. The only other really popular children's author of the late 1990s was an American, R. L. Stine. Some of the story elements in *Philosopher's Stone* resembled parts of Dahl's stories. For example, the hero of *James and the Giant Peach* lost his parents and had to live with a pair of unpleasant aunts‍—‌one fat and one thin rather like Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, who treated Harry as a servant. However Harry Potter was a distinctive creation, able to take on the responsibilities of an adult while remaining a child inside.[14]\n\n\nLibrarian Nancy Knapp and marketing professor Stephen Brown noted the liveliness and detail of descriptions, especially of shop scenes such as Diagon Alley.[21][52] Tad Brennan commented that Rowling's writing resembles that of Homer: \"rapid, plain, and direct in expression\".[50] Stephen King admired \"the sort of playful details of which only British fantasists seem capable\" and concluded that they worked because Rowling enjoys a quick giggle and then moves briskly forward.[53]\n\n\nNicholas Tucker described the early *Harry Potter* books as looking back to Victorian and Edwardian children's stories: Hogwarts was an old-style boarding school in which the teachers addressed pupils formally by their surnames and were most concerned with the reputations of the houses with which they were associated; characters' personalities were plainly shown by their appearances, starting with the Dursleys; evil or malicious characters were to be crushed rather than reformed, including Argus Filch's cat Mrs Norris; and the hero, a mistreated orphan who found his true place in life, was charismatic and good at sports, but considerate and protective towards the weak.[54] Several other commentators have stated that the books present a highly stratified society including many social stereotypes.[55] However Karin Westerman drew parallels with 1990s Britain: a class system that was breaking down but defended by those whose power and status it upheld; the multi-ethnic composition of Hogwarts' students; the racial tensions between the various intelligent species; and school bullying.[56]\n\n\nSusan Hall wrote that there is no rule of law in the books, as the actions of Ministry of Magic officials are unconstrained by laws, accountability or any kind of legal challenge. This provides an opportunity for Voldemort to offer his own horrific version of order. As a side-effect Harry and Hermione, who were brought up in the highly regulated Muggle world, find solutions by thinking in ways unfamiliar to wizards. For example, Hermione notes that one obstacle to finding the Philosopher's Stone is a test of logic rather than magical power, and that most wizards have no chance of solving it.[57]\n\n\nNel suggested that the unflattering characterisation of the extremely conventional, status-conscious, materialistic Dursleys was Rowling's reaction to the family policies of the British government in the early 1990s, which treated the married heterosexual couple as the \"preferred norm\", while the author was a single mother. Harry's relationships with adult and juvenile wizards are based on affection and loyalty. This is reflected in his happiness whenever he is a temporary member of the Weasley family throughout the series, and in his treatment of first Rubeus Hagrid and later Remus Lupin and Sirius Black as father-figures.[20]: 13–15, 47–48[51]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n### Sequels[edit]\n\n\nThe second book, *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*, was originally published in the UK on 2 July 1998 and later, in the US on 2 June 1999.[58][59] *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban* was then published a year later in the UK on 8 July 1999 and in the US on 8 September 1999.[58][59] *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire* was published on 8 July 2000 at the same time by Bloomsbury and Scholastic.[60] *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix* is the longest book in the series at 766 pages in the UK version and 870 pages in the US version.[61] It was published worldwide in English on 21 June 2003.[62] *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince* was published on 16 July 2005 and sold 11 million copies in the first 24 hours of its worldwide release.[63][64] The seventh and final novel, *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*, was published on 21 July 2007.[65] The book sold 11 million copies within 24 hours of its release: 2.7 million copies in the UK and 8.3 million in the US.[66]\n\n\n\n### Illustrated version[edit]\n\n\nAn illustrated version of *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* was released on 6 October 2015, with illustrations by Jim Kay.[67][68] The book carries over 100 illustrations and will be followed by illustrated versions of all seven books from the series by the same artist.\n\n\n\n### Podcast version[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2020, a reading podcast by Spotify was created and entitled *Harry Potter at Home: Readings*. Each chapter is narrated by a celebrity guest from the *Harry Potter* and *Wizarding World* franchises.[69]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Chapter | Title | Release date | Runtime | Narrated by\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | *The Boy Who Lived* | 5 May 2020 | 25 mins, 54 secs | Daniel Radcliffe |\n| 2 | *The Vanishing Glass* | 8 May 2020 | 27 mins, 27 secs | Noma Dumezweni |\n| 3 | *The Letters from No One* | 12 May 2020 | 26 mins, 14 secs | Eddie Redmayne |\n| 4 | *The Keeper of the Keys* | 14 May 2020 | 26 mins, 54 secs | Stephen Fry |\n| 5 | *Diagon Alley* | 19 May 2020 | 48 mins, 1 sec | Simon Callow, Bonnie Wright and Evanna Lynch |\n| 6 | *The Journey from Platform Nine and Three-Quarters* | 20 May 2020 | 41 mins, 47 secs | Jamie Parker and cast of *Harry Potter and the Cursed Child* |\n| 7 | *The Sorting Hat* | 27 May 2020 | 27 mins, 1 sec | Olivia Colman, Jonathan Van Ness and Kate McKinnon |\n| 8 | *The Potions Master* | 28 May 2020 | 18 mins, 36 secs | Alia Bhatt, Alec Baldwin and Carmen Baldwin\n |\n| 9 | *Midnight Duel* | 3 June 2020 | 33 mins, 21 secs | Alison Sudol and Dan Fogler |\n| 10 | *Hallowe'en* | 4 June 2020 | 29 mins, 06 secs | Whoopi Goldberg |\n| 11 | *Quidditch* | 10 June 2020 | 22 mins, 27 secs | David Tennant and David Beckham |\n| 12 | *The Mirror of Erised* | 3 July 2020 | 39 mins, 14 secs | Matthew Lewis, Helen Howard and Imelda Staunton |\n| 13 | *Nicolas Flamel* | 7 July 2020 | 22 mins, 2 secs | Hugh Bonneville |\n| 14 | *Norbert the Norwegian Ridgeback* | 8 July 2020 | 26 mins, 6 secs | Jason Isaacs, Tom Felton and Helen McCrory |\n| 15 | *The Forbidden Forest* | 13 July 2020 | 33 mins, 3 secs | Claudia Kim and Dakota Fanning |\n| 16 | *Through the Trapdoor* | 14 July 2020 | 51 mins, 35 secs | Kenneth Branagh, Ruth Wilson and Helena Bonham Carter |\n| 17 | *The Man with the Two Faces* | 16 July 2020 | 41 mins, 29 secs | Three families of *Harry Potter* fans, with a surprise appearance from J. K.

Writing about clinical teaching in medical schools, Jennifer Conn contrasted Snape's technical expertise with his intimidating behaviour towards students. Quidditch coach Madam Hooch on the other hand, illustrated useful techniques in the teaching of physical skills, including breaking down complex actions into sequences of simple ones and helping students to avoid common errors.[93] Joyce Fields wrote that the books illustrate four of the five main topics in a typical first-year sociology class: \"sociological concepts including culture, society, and socialisation; stratification and social inequality; social institutions; and social theory\".[55]\n\n\nStephen Brown noted that the early *Harry Potter* books, especially *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*, were a runaway success despite inadequate and poorly organised marketing. Brown advised marketing executives to be less preoccupied with rigorous statistical analyses and the \"analysis, planning, implementation, and control\" model of management. Instead he recommended that they should treat the stories as \"a marketing masterclass\", full of enticing products and brand names.[52] For example, a real-world analogue of Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans was introduced under licence in 2000 by toymaker Hasbro.[52][94]\n\n\n\n## Release history[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Country\n | Release date\n | Edition(Hardback/Paperback) | Publisher\n | Pages\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| United Kingdom\n | 26 June 1997[95][96] | Hardback Children's Edition\n | Bloomsbury | 223\n |\n| Paperback Children's Edition\n |\n| 11 September 1998[97] | Paperback Adult Edition (Original) |\n| 27 September 1999[98] | Hardback Signature Special Edition\n |\n| 8 October 2001[99] | Paperback Special Edition\n |\n| 10 July 2004[100] | Hardback Adult Edition (Re-issue with new cover) | 336\n |\n| 4 October 2004[101] | Paperback Adult Edition (Re-issue with new cover) | 223\n |\n| 1 November 2010[102] | Paperback Harry Potter Signature Edition\n |\n| 18 July 2013[103] | Paperback Adult Edition (Re-issue with new cover) |\n| 1 September 2014[104][105] | Hardcover Children's Edition (Re-issue with new cover) | 352\n |\n| Paperback Children's Edition (Re-issue with new cover) |\n| 6 October 2015[106] | Hardcover Illustrated Edition (Illustrated by Jim Kay) | 256\n |\n| 20 October 2020[107] | MinaLima Edition\n | 368\n |\n| 9 June 2022[108] | Hardcover Children's Edition (25th Anniversary Edition) | 352\n |\n| United States\n | 1 September 1998[109] | Hardback\n | Arthur A.

For other uses, see And Then There Were None (disambiguation).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd Then There Were None | ![](image)Cover of first UK 1939 edition with original title\n |\n| Author | Agatha Christie |\n| Original title | *Ten Little Niggers* |\n| Cover artist | Stephen Bellman |\n| Language | English |\n| Genre | * Mystery\n* crime\n* psychological thriller\n |\n| Publisher | Collins Crime Club |\n| Publication date\n | 6 November 1939 |\n| Publication place | United Kingdom |\n| Pages | 272[1] |\n| Preceded by | *Murder Is Easy* |\n| Followed by | *Sad Cypress* |\n| Website | *And Then There Were None* |\n\n\n***And Then There Were None*** is a mystery novel by the English writer Agatha Christie, who described it as the most difficult of her books to write.[2] It was first published in the United Kingdom by the Collins Crime Club on 6 November 1939, as ***Ten Little Niggers***,[3] after an 1869 minstrel song that serves as a major plot element.[4][5] The US edition was released in January 1940 with the title *And Then There Were None*, taken from the last five words of the song.[6] Successive American reprints and adaptations use that title, though American Pocket Books paperbacks used the title ***Ten Little Indians*** between 1964 and 1986. UK editions continued to use the original title until 1985.[7]\n\n\nThe book is the world's best-selling mystery, and with over 100 million copies sold is one of the best-selling books of all time. The novel has been listed as the sixth best-selling title (any language, including reference works).[8]\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nEight people arrive on a small, isolated island off the Devon coast, each having received an unexpected personal invitation. They are met by the butler and cook/housekeeper, Thomas and Ethel Rogers, who explain that their hosts, Ulick Norman Owen and Una Nancy Owen, have not yet arrived, though they have left instructions.\n\n\nA framed copy of an old rhyme hangs in every guest's room, and on the dining room table sit ten figurines. After supper, a phonograph record is played; the recording accuses each visitor and Mr and Mrs Rogers of having committed murder, then asks if any of the \"prisoners at the bar\" wishes to offer a defence.\n\n\nThe guests discover that none of them know the Owens, and Mr Justice Wargrave suggests that the name \"U N Owen\" is a play on \"Unknown\". Marston finishes his drink and promptly dies of cyanide poisoning. Dr Armstrong confirms that there was no cyanide in the other drinks and says that Marston must have dosed himself.\n\n\nThe next morning, Mrs Rogers is found dead in her bed. Suspecting that U N Owen may be systematically murdering them, three of the guests search the island, but find no hiding places. After General MacArthur dies from a heavy blow to the head, it is concluded that one of the seven remaining persons must be the killer. The next morning, Mr Rogers is found dead at the woodpile, and Emily Brent is found dead in the drawing room, having been injected with potassium cyanide. The manner of deaths appear to correspond with the rhyme, with one of the figurines being removed for each successive death.\n\n\nWargrave suggests searching the rooms, and Lombard's gun is found to be missing. Vera Claythorne goes up to her room and screams when she finds seaweed hanging from the ceiling. Most of the remaining guests rush upstairs; when they return they find Wargrave still downstairs in his chair, crudely dressed in the attire of a judge. Dr Armstrong pronounces him dead from a gunshot wound to the forehead.\n\n\nThat night, Lombard's gun is returned, and Blore sees someone leaving the house. Armstrong is absent from his room. Lombard and Blore search the island and the house, but do not find Armstrong. The next morning, Vera, Blore, and Lombard decide to stick together and leave the house. When Blore returns for food, he is killed by a marble clock shaped like a bear that is pushed from Vera's window sill. Vera and Lombard find Armstrong's body washed up on the beach, and each concludes the other must be responsible. Vera suggests moving the body from the shore as a mark of respect, but this is a pretext to acquire Lombard's gun. When Lombard lunges for it, she shoots him dead.\n\n\nVera returns to the house in a shaken, post-traumatic state. She finds a noose and chair arranged in her room. Overcome by guilt, she hangs herself in accordance with the last line of the rhyme.\n\n\nScotland Yard officials arrive on the island to find nobody alive. They discover that a sleazy lawyer and drug trafficker called Isaac Morris had arranged the invitations and ordered the recording. However, he had died of a barbiturate overdose on the night the guests arrived. The police reconstruct the deaths with the help of the victims' diaries and a coroner's report. They are able to eliminate several suspects due to the circumstances of their deaths and items being moved afterward, but ultimately they cannot identify the killer.\n\n\nMuch later, a trawler hauls up in its nets a bottle containing a written confession. In it, Mr Justice Wargrave recounts that all his life he had had two contradictory impulses: a strong sense of justice and a savage bloodlust. He had satisfied both through his profession as a criminal judge, sentencing murderers to death following their trial. After receiving a diagnosis of a terminal illness, he had decided on a private scheme to deal with a group of people he considered to have escaped justice.\n\n\nTo set up his scheme, Wargrave had employed an agent, Morris, to purchase the island and to make the necessary arrangements, before killing him with a lethal dose of barbiturates. Posing as one of the guests, he had with Dr Armstrong's naive assistance faked his own death by gunshot on the pretext that it would help the group identify the killer. After disposing of Armstrong and the remaining guests, and moving objects to confuse the police, he finally committed suicide by shooting himself in the head, using the gun and some elastic to ensure that his true death matched the account of his staged death recorded in the guests' diaries. Wargrave had written his confession and thrown it into the sea in a bottle in response to what he acknowledged to be his \"pitiful human need\" for recognition.\n\n\n\n## Principal characters[edit]\n\n\n* Edward George Armstrong - a Harley Street doctor\n* William Henry Blore - a former police inspector, now a private investigator\n* Emily Caroline Brent - an elderly, pious spinster\n* Vera Elizabeth Claythorne - a young woman on leave from her position as a sports mistress at a girls' school\n* Philip Lombard - a soldier of fortune\n* General John Gordon MacArthur - a retired World War I general\n* Anthony James Marston (Tony Marston) - an amoral and irresponsible young man\n* Ethel Rogers - the cook/housekeeper and Thomas Rogers' wife\n* Thomas Rogers - the butler and Ethel Rogers' husband\n* Lawrence John Wargrave (Mr Justice Wargrave) - a retired criminal judge\n\n\n## Structure of the novel[edit]\n\n\nThe plot is structured around the ten lines of the rhyme \"Ten Little Niggers\",[3] an 1869 minstrel song by the British songwriter Frank Green.[9] In later editions, the characters are replaced by \"Ten Little Indians\" or \"Ten Little Soldiers\". (Confusingly, the American songwriter Septimus Winner had published his own, quite different, minstrel song in 1868, called \"Ten Little Indians [or Injuns]\").[10][11]\n\n\nThis is the rhyme as published in a British 2008 edition:[12]\n\n\n\n\n> Ten little Soldier Boys went out to dine; One choked his little self and then there were nine.  \n> \n> Nine little Soldier Boys sat up very late; One overslept himself and then there were eight.  \n> \n> Eight little Soldier Boys travelling in Devon; One said he'd stay there and then there were seven.[13]  \n> \n> Seven little Soldier Boys chopping up sticks; One chopped himself in halves and then there were six.  \n> \n> Six little Soldier Boys playing with a hive; A bumblebee stung one and then there were five.  \n> \n> Five little Soldier Boys going in for law; One got in Chancery and then there were four.  \n> \n> Four little Soldier Boys going out to sea; A red herring swallowed one and then there were three.  \n> \n> Three little Soldier Boys walking in the zoo; A big bear hugged one and then there were two.  \n> \n> Two little Soldier Boys sitting in the sun; One got frizzled up and then there was one.  \n> \n> One little Soldier Boy left all alone; He went out and hanged himself and then there were none.\n> \n\n\nEach of the ten victims – eight guests plus the island's two caretakers – is killed in a manner that reflects one of the lines of the rhyme. A lawyer who helped arrange the affair is also killed during this time, but his killing occurs on the mainland and outside of the story.\n\n\n\n### Correspondence between rhyme and modes of death[edit]\n\n\n\n\nModes of death of the victims vs the wording of the rhyme\n| No.\n | Character\n | Accusation\n | Mode of death\n | Original rhyme, early UK editions[14] | Current version of the rhyme[12] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| -\n | **Isaac Morris** (Wargrave's agent)\n | Sold illegal drugs to a woman who became an addict and later committed suicide\n | Tricked into taking a lethal drug overdose to combat his imagined ailments\n |  |  |\n| 1\n | **Anthony James Marston** | Struck and killed two young children while recklessly speeding\n | Chokes to death after drinking cyanide-laced whisky\n | Ten little nigger boys went out to dine;\nOne choked his little self and then there were Nine.\n | Ten little Soldier Boys went out to dine;\nOne choked his little self and then there were nine.\n |\n| 2\n | **Mrs Ethel Rogers** | Allowed herself to be persuaded by her husband into withholding a former employer's medicine in order to cause her death and collect an inheritance\n | Dies in her sleep after drinking brandy spiked with an overdose of chloral hydrate | Nine little nigger boys sat up very late;\nOne overslept himself and then there were Eight.\n | Nine little Soldier Boys sat up very late;\nOne overslept himself and then there were eight.\n |\n| 3\n | **General John Gordon MacArthur** | Discovered that his wife was having an affair with an officer under his command, then sent the man on a mission to almost certain death\n | Killed by a heavy blow to the head\n | Eight little nigger boys travelling in Devon;\nOne said he'd stay there and then there were Seven.\n | Eight little Soldier Boys travelling in Devon;\nOne said he'd stay there and then there were seven.[13]\n |\n| 4\n | **Thomas Rogers** | Induced his wife to withhold a former employer's medicine in order to cause her death and collect an inheritance\n | Killed with an axe while chopping wood\n | Seven little nigger boys chopping up sticks;\nOne chopped himself in halves and then there were Six.\n | Seven little Soldier Boys chopping up sticks;\nOne chopped himself in halves and then there were six.\n |\n| 5\n | **Emily Caroline Brent** | Dismissed her teenage maid for becoming pregnant out of wedlock, this causing the maid to drown herself\n | Injected with cyanide after drinking chloral-laced coffee\n | Six little nigger boys playing with a hive;\nA bumble-bee stung one and then there were Five.\n | Six little Soldier Boys playing with a hive;\nA bumblebee stung one and then there were five.\n |\n| 6\n | **Lawrence John Wargrave (Mr Justice Wargrave)** | Improperly influenced a jury to bring in a guilty verdict against a man many thought to be innocent, then sentenced him to death\n | Gunshot wound to the head, while dressed as a judge\n | Five little nigger boys going in for law;\nOne got in Chancery and then there were Four.\n | Five little Soldier Boys going in for law;\nOne got in Chancery and then there were four.\n |\n| 7\n | **Dr Edward George Armstrong** | Operated on a patient while drunk, resulting in her death\n | Drowns after being pushed off a cliff into the sea\n | Four little nigger boys going out to sea;\nA red herring swallowed one and then there were Three.\n | Four little Soldier Boys going out to sea;\nA red herring swallowed one and then there were three.\n |\n| 8\n | **William Henry Blore** | Gave perjured evidence in court resulting in an innocent man being convicted and sentenced to life in prison, where he died a year later\n | Head crushed by a marble clock shaped like a bear\n | Three little nigger boys walking in the zoo;\nA big bear hugged one and then there were Two.\n | Three little Soldier Boys walking in the zoo;\nA big bear hugged one and then there were two.\n |\n| 9\n | **Philip Lombard** | As a soldier of Fortune, stole food from a group of East African tribesmen he was working with, then left them to die\n | Shot by Vera on the beach with his own revolver\n | Two little nigger boys sitting in the sun;\nOne got frizzled up and then there was One.\n | Two little Soldier Boys sitting in the sun;\nOne got frizzled up and then there was one.\n |\n| 10\n | **Vera Elizabeth Claythorne** | As a governess, allowed her young charge to drown so that his uncle could inherit the family estate and marry her\n | Hangs herself\n | One little nigger boy left all alone;\nHe went and hanged himself and then there were None.\n | One little Soldier Boy left all alone;\nHe went out and hanged himself and then there were none.\n |\n\n\n## Literary significance and reception[edit]\n\n\nWriting for *The Times Literary Supplement* of 11 November 1939, Maurice Percy Ashley stated, \"If her latest story has scarcely any detection in it there is no scarcity of murders... There is a certain feeling of monotony inescapable in the regularity of the deaths which is better suited to a serialized newspaper story than a full-length novel. Yet there is an ingenious problem to solve in naming the murderer\", he continued. \"It will be an extremely astute reader who guesses correctly.\"[15]\n\n\nFor *The New York Times Book Review* (25 February 1940), Isaac Anderson has arrived to the point where \"the voice\" accuses the ten \"guests\" of their past crimes, which have all resulted in the deaths of humans, and then said, \"When you read what happens after that you will not believe it, but you will keep on reading, and as one incredible event is followed by another even more incredible you will still keep on reading. The whole thing is utterly impossible and utterly fascinating. It is the most baffling mystery that Agatha Christie has ever written, and if any other writer has ever surpassed it for sheer puzzlement the name escapes our memory. We are referring, of course, to mysteries that have logical explanations, as this one has. It is a tall story, to be sure, but it could have happened.\"[16]\n\n\nMany compared the book to her 1926 novel *The Murder of Roger Ackroyd*. For instance, an unnamed reviewer in the *Toronto Daily Star* of 16 March 1940 said, \"Others have written better mysteries than Agatha Christie, but no one can touch her for ingenious plot and surprise ending. With *And Then There Were None*... she is at her most ingenious and most surprising... is, indeed, considerably above the standard of her last few works and close to the *Roger Ackroyd* level.\"[17]\n\n\nOther critics laud the use of plot twists and surprise endings. Maurice Richardson wrote a rhapsodic review in *The Observer*'s issue of 5 November 1939 which began, \"No wonder Agatha Christie's latest has sent her publishers into a vatic trance. We will refrain, however, from any invidious comparisons with *Roger Ackroyd* and be content with saying that *Ten Little Niggers* is one of the very best, most genuinely bewildering Christies yet written. We will also have to refrain from reviewing it thoroughly, as it is so full of shocks that even the mildest revelation would spoil some surprise from somebody, and I am sure that you would rather have your entertainment kept fresh than criticism pure.\" After stating the set-up of the plot, Richardson concluded, \"Story telling and characterisation are right at the top of Mrs Christie's baleful form. Her plot may be highly artificial, but it is neat, brilliantly cunning, soundly constructed, and free from any of those red-herring false trails which sometimes disfigure her work.\"[3]\n\n\nRobert Barnard, writing in 1990, concurred with the early reviews, describing the book as \"Suspenseful and menacing detective-story-cum-thriller. The closed setting with the succession of deaths is here taken to its logical conclusion, and the dangers of ludicrousness and sheer reader-disbelief are skillfully avoided. Probably the best-known Christie, and justifiably among the most popular.\"[18]\n\n\nThe original title of the mystery (*Ten Little Niggers*) was changed because it was offensive. Alison Light, a literary critic and feminist scholar, opined that Christie's original title and the setting on \"Nigger Island\" (later changed to \"Indian Island\" and \"Soldier Island\", variously) were integral to the work. These aspects of the novel, she argued, \"could be relied upon automatically to conjure up a thrilling 'otherness', a place where revelations about the 'dark side' of the English would be appropriate.\"[19] Unlike novels such as *Heart of Darkness*, \"Christie's location is both more domesticated and privatized, taking for granted the construction of racial fears woven into psychic life as early as the nursery. If her story suggests how easy it is to play upon such fears, it is also a reminder of how intimately tied they are to sources of pleasure and enjoyment.\"[19]\n\n\nIn 1990 Crime Writers' Association ranked *And Then There Were None* 19th in their The Top 100 Crime Novels of All Time list. In 1995 in a similar list Mystery Writers of America ranked the novel 10th.[20] In September 2015, to mark her 125th birthday, *And Then There Were None* was named the \"World's Favourite Christie\" in a vote sponsored by the author's estate.[21][22]\n\n\nIn the \"Binge!\" article of *Entertainment Weekly* Issue #1343-44 (26 December 2014–3 January 2015), the writers picked *And Then There Were None* as an \"EW favorite\" on the list of the \"Nine Great Christie Novels\".[23]\n\n\n\n### Christie's own assessment[edit]\n\n\n\"I had written the book *Ten Little Niggers* because it was so difficult to do that the idea had fascinated me. Ten people had to die without it becoming ridiculous or the murderer being obvious. I wrote the book after a tremendous amount of planning, and I was pleased with what I had made of it. It was clear, straightforward, baffling, and yet had a perfectly reasonable explanation; in fact, it had to have an epilogue in order to explain it. It was well received and reviewed, but the person who was really pleased with it was myself, for I knew better than any critic how difficult it had been... I don't say it is the play or book of mine that I like best, or even that I think it is my best, but I do think in some ways that it is a better piece of craftsmanship than anything else I have written.\"[24]\n\n\n\n## Publication[edit]\n\n\nThe novel has a long and noteworthy history of publication. It is a continuously best selling novel in English and in translation to other languages since its initial publication. From the start, in English, it was published under two different titles, due to different sensitivity to the author's title in the UK and in the US at first publication.\n\n\nThe novel was originally published in late 1939 and early 1940 almost simultaneously, in the United Kingdom and the United States. The serialization was in 23 parts in the *Daily Express* from Tuesday 6 June to Saturday 1 July 1939. All of the instalments carried an illustration by \"Prescott\" with the first having an illustration of Burgh Island in Devon which inspired the setting of the story. The serialized version did not contain any chapter divisions.[25] The book retailed for seven shillings and sixpence.\n\n\n\n### Title[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cover of first US 1940 edition with current title for all English-language versions.\nIn the UK the book first appeared under the title *Ten Little Niggers*, in book and newspaper serialized formats. In the United States it was published under the title *And Then There Were None*, in both book and serial formats. Both of the original US publications changed the title from that originally used in the UK, due to the offensiveness of the word in American culture, where it was more widely perceived as a racially loaded ethnic slur or insult compared to the contemporaneous culture in the United Kingdom. The serialized version appeared in the *Saturday Evening Post* in seven parts from 20 May (Volume 211, Number 47) to 1 July 1939 (Volume 212, Number 1) with illustrations by Henry Raleigh, and the book was published in January 1940 by Dodd, Mead and Company for $2.[4][5][6]\n\n\nIn the original UK novel, and in succeeding publications until 1985, all references to \"Indians\" or \"Soldiers\" were originally \"Nigger\", including the island's name, the pivotal rhyme found by the visitors, and the ten figurines.[5] UK editions continued to use the original title until the current definitive title appeared with a reprint of the 1963 Fontana Paperback in 1985.[7]\n\n\nThe word \"nigger\" was already racially offensive in the United States by the start of the 20th century, and therefore the book's first US edition (1940) and first serialization changed the title to *And Then There Were None* and removed all references to the word from the book, as did the 1945 motion picture (except that the first US edition retained 'nigger in the woodpile' in Chapter 2 Part VII and Chapter 7 Part III). Sensitivity to the original title of the novel was remarked by Sadie Stein in 2016, commenting on a BBC mini series with the title *And Then There Were None*, where she noted that \"even in 1939, this title was considered too offensive for American publication.\"[26] In general, \"Christie’s work is not known for its racial sensitivity, and by modern standards her oeuvre is rife with casual Orientalism.\"[26] The original title was based on a rhyme from minstrel shows and children's games. Stein quotes Alison Light as to the power of the original name of the island in the novel, Nigger Island, \"to conjure up a thrilling 'otherness', a place where revelations about the 'dark side' of the English would be appropriate\".[27] Light goes on to say that \"Christie's location [the island] is both more domesticated and privatised, taking for granted the construction of racial fears woven into psychic life as early as the nursery.\"[27] Speaking of the \"widely known\" 1945 film, Stein added that \"we’re merely faced with fantastic amounts of violence, and a rhyme so macabre and distressing one doesn't hear it now outside of the Agatha Christie context.\"[26] She felt that the original title of the novel in the UK, seen now, \"jars, viscerally\".[26]\n\n\n\n### Best-selling crime novel[edit]\n\n\n*And Then There Were None* is the best-selling crime novel of all time, and made Agatha Christie the best-selling novelist, according to the Agatha Christie Estate.[2]\n\n\nIt is Christie's best-selling novel, with more than 100 million copies sold; it is also the world's best-selling mystery and one of the best-selling books of all time. Publications International lists the novel as the sixth best-selling title.[8]\n\n\n\n### Editions in English[edit]\n\n\nThe book and its adaptations have been released under various new names since the original publication, including *Ten Little Indians* (1946 play, Broadway performance and 1964 paperback book), *Ten Little Soldiers,* and official title per the Agatha Christie Limited website, *And Then There Were None*.[2] UK editions continued to use the work's original title until the 1980s; the first UK edition to use the alternative title *And Then There Were None* appeared in 1985 with a reprint of the 1963 Fontana Paperback.[7]\n\n\n\n* Christie, Agatha (November 1939). *Ten Little Niggers*.

Last publication of novel under the title *Ten Little Indians*.\n\n\n### Foreign-language editions[edit]\n\n\nMany older translations were based on the original British text, although the word used to translate *nigger* was often somewhat less offensive, more analogous to English *negro* or *negrito*. Languages where the most recent edition retains racial epithets include Spanish, Greek, Serbian, Bulgarian, Romanian,[29][*better source needed*] Russian[30] and Hungarian, as well as the 1987 Soviet film adaptation *Desyat Negrityat*. Changes similar to those in the British edition in the 1980s were made to the German novel in 2003,[n 1] after 2002 protests in Hanover against a stage version using the old title.[31] Similar changes were made in Dutch in 2004,[n 2] Swedish in 2007,[n 3] Brazilian Portuguese in 2009,[n 4] Polish in 2017,[n 5] French in 2020,[n 6] and Turkish in 2022.[38] In 1999, the Slovak National Theatre changed the title of a stage adaptation mid-run.[n 7] The estate of Agatha Christie now offers it under only one title in English, *And Then There Were None*,[2] and translations increasingly use the equivalent of this as their title.[35] European Portuguese translations have been titled *Convite Para a Morte* (1948: \"An Invitation to Death\") and *As Dez Figuras Negras* (2011: \"The Ten Black Figures\" – referring to the figurines, in this case minimally anthropomorphic).[35] The Finnish translation *Eikä yksikään pelastunut* (\"No one was saved\") in 1940 had its title taken from the American first edition, before being renamed *Kymmenen pientä neekeripoikaa* (\"Ten little negro boys\") in 1968. This change was reversed in 2003.[40]\n\n\n\n## Possible inspirations[edit]\n\n\nThe 1930 novel *The Invisible Host* by Gwen Bristow and Bruce Manning has a plot that strongly matches that of Christie's later novel, including a recorded voice announcing to the guests that their sins will be visited upon them by death. *The Invisible Host* was adapted as the 1930 Broadway play *The Ninth Guest* by Owen Davis,[41] which itself was adapted as the 1934 film *The Ninth Guest*. There is no evidence Christie saw either the play (which had a brief run on Broadway) or the film.\n\n\nThe 1933 K.B.S. Productions Sherlock Holmes film *A Study in Scarlet* follows a strikingly similar plot;[42] the victims are tormented by slips of paper inspired by the same poem as Christie's, one says \"Six Little Black Boys | Playing With a Hive | A Bumble-Bee Stung One | And Then There Were Five.\" And it anticipates the largest plot twist in Christie's book, the killer turns out to be one of the \"victims\" who had already been identified as dead. The film retained no plot points from Arthur Conan Doyle's original story of the same name. The author of the movie's screenplay, Robert Florey, \"doubted that [Christie] had seen *A Study in Scarlet*, but he regarded it as a compliment if it had helped inspire her\".[43]\n\n\n\n## Adaptations[edit]\n\n\n*And Then There Were None* has had more adaptations than any other work by Agatha Christie.[2] Christie herself changed the bleak ending to a more palatable one for theatre audiences when she adapted the novel for the stage in 1943. Many adaptations incorporate changes to the story, such as using Christie's alternative ending from her stage play or changing the setting to locations other than an island.\n\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\nThere have been numerous film adaptations of the novel:\n\n\n\n* *And Then There Were None* (1945 film), American film by René Clair\n* *Ten Little Indians* (1965 film), British film directed by George Pollock and produced by Harry Alan Towers; Pollock had previously handled four Miss Marple films starring Margaret Rutherford. Set in a mountain retreat in Austria.\n* *Gumnaam* (1965, translation: *Unknown* or *Anonymous*), an Indian suspense thriller. This loose, uncredited Hindi film adaptation added the characteristic \"Bollywood\" elements of comedy, music and dance to Christie's plot.[44]\n* *Nadu Iravil* (1970, translation: *In the middle of the night*), a Tamil adaptation directed by S. Balachander[45]\n* *And Then There Were None* (1974), the first English-language colour version, directed by Peter Collinson and produced by Harry Alan Towers. Based on a screenplay by Towers (writing as \"Peter Welbeck\"), who co-wrote the screenplay for the 1965 film. Set at a grand hotel in the Iranian desert.\n* *Ten Little Maidens*, a 1985 adult film starring Nina Hartley, Amber Lynn, Eric Edwards, Harry Reems and Ginger Lynn\n* *Desyat' Negrityat* (1987, *Десять негритят*, Eng: \"Ten Little Negroes\") a Russian adaptation produced/directed by Stanislav Govorukhin, notable for being the first cinema adaptation to keep the novel's original plot and grim ending.\n* *Ten Little Indians*, a 1989 British version, produced by Harry Alan Towers and directed by Alan Birkinshaw, set on safari in the African savannah\n* *Aduthathu*, a 2012 Tamil adaptation[46]\n* *Aatagara*, a 2015 Kannada adaptation[47]\n\n\n### Radio[edit]\n\n\nThe BBC broadcast *Ten Little Niggers* (1947), adapted by Ayton Whitaker, first aired as a Monday Matinee on the BBC Home Service on 27 December 1947 and as *Saturday Night Theatre* on the BBC Light Programme on 29 December.[48]\n\n\nOn 13 November 2010, as part of its *Saturday Play* series, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a 90-minute adaptation written by Joy Wilkinson. The production was directed by Mary Peate and featured Geoffrey Whitehead as Mr Justice Wargrave, Lyndsey Marshal as Vera Claythorne, Alex Wyndham as Philip Lombard, John Rowe as Dr Armstrong, and Joanna Monro as Emily Brent.\n\n\n\n### Stage[edit]\n\n\n*And Then There Were None* (1943 play) is Christie's adaptation of the story for the stage. She and the producers agreed that audiences might not flock to a tale with such a grim ending as the novel, nor would it work well dramatically as there would be no one left to tell the story. Christie reworked the ending for Lombard and Vera to be innocent of the crimes of which they were accused, survive, and fall in love with each other. Some of the names were also changed, e.g., General MacArthur became General McKenzie in both the New York and London productions.[49][50] By 1943, General Douglas MacArthur was playing a prominent role in the Pacific Theatre of World War II, which may explain the change of the character's name.\n\n\n*Ten Little Niggers* (1944 play): Dundee Repertory Theatre Company was given special permission to restore the original ending of the novel. The company first performed a stage adaptation of the novel in August 1944 under the UK title of the novel, with Christie credited as the dramatist.[51] It was the first performance in repertory theatre.[51] It was staged again in 1965.[52] There was an article in the *Dundee Evening Register* in August 1944 about it.\n\n\n*And Then There Were None* (2005 play): On 14 October 2005, a new version of the play, written by Kevin Elyot and directed by Steven Pimlott, opened at the Gielgud Theatre in London. For this version, Elyot returned to the original story in the novel, restoring the nihilism of the original.[53]\n\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\nSeveral variations of the original novel were adapted for television, three of which were British adaptations. The first of these, in 1949, was produced by the BBC.[54] The second was produced in 1959,[55] by ITV. Both of those productions aired with Christie's original title. The third and most recent British adaptation aired as *And Then There Were None* on BBC One in December 2015, as a drama serial broadcast on three consecutive nights, produced in cooperation with Acorn Media and Agatha Christie Productions. The 2015 production adhered more closely to the original plot, though there were several differences to backstories and actual murders on the island, and was the first English language live-action adaptation to feature an ending similar to that of the novel. It was directed by Craig Viveiros and adapted for television by Sarah Phelps.[56]\n\n\nAn American TV movie aired on NBC 18 January 1959. It was directed by Paul Bogart, and starred Barry Jones and Nina Foch.\n\n\nThere have been many foreign-language TV adaptations:\n\n\n\n* A Portuguese-language version for Brazilian television, broadcast 16 February 1957, titled *O Caso dos Dez Negrinhos*\n* *O Caso dos Dez Negrinhos*, a 1963 episode of the Brazilian anthology series *Grande Teatro Tupi [pt]*\n* A West German television production, *Zehn kleine Negerlein*, which aired in 1969\n* *Dix petits nègres*, a 1970 episode of the French anthology series *Au théâtre ce soir [fr]*\n* *Achra Abid Zghar* (1974, translation: *Ten Little Slaves*), a Télé Liban TV series directed by Jean Fayyad, adapted for television by Latifeh Moultaka\n* *Deka Mikroi Negroi*, a 1978 episode of the Greek anthology series *To theatro tis Defteras*\n* A free Spanish adaptation made by RTVE in 2011 as the two-parter *The mystery of the ten strangers* for the second season of *Los misterios de Laura* (part 1 and part 2)\n* *Achra Abid Zghar* (2014, translation: *Ten Little Slaves*), an MTV Lebanon television production\n* *Soshite daremo inakunatta* (そして誰もいなくなった), a two-part Japanese-language adaptation by Shukei Nagasaka (長坂秀佳, *Nagasaka Shukei*) set in modern times, aired 25 and 26 March 2017 on TV Asahi in Japan. It was directed by Seiji Izumi and adapted for television by Hideka Nagasaka.[57][58]\n* *Ils étaient dix [fr]*, a French six-part miniseries produced by M6 and aired in 2020, set on a tropical island in present time\n\n\nIn 2010, American animated TV series *Family Guy* adapted the story as \"And Then There Were Fewer\".[59]\n\n\n\n### Other media[edit]\n\n\nThe novel was the inspiration for several video games. For the Apple II, Online Systems released *Mystery House* in 1980. On the PC, The Adventure Company released *Agatha Christie: And Then There Were None* in 2005, the first in a series of PC games based on Christie novels. In February 2008, it was ported to the Wii console.[60]\n\n\nThe Japanese visual novel series *Umineko When They Cry* also drew inspiration from the novel on many fronts. Both stories involve a series of murders on an island during a storm intended to be unsolvable murders where everyone on the island dies. There is a poem that foretells the series of deaths beforehand in both as well. Finally, the solution to both mysteries are tossed into the ocean in the form of messages in a bottle for the reader to learn from at the end of the stories. This is exemplified by the manga version of the series directly referencing *And Then There Were None* in its last chapter.[61][*unreliable source?*]\n\n\n*And Then There Were None* was released by HarperCollins as a graphic novel adaptation on 30 April 2009, adapted by François Rivière and illustrated by Frank Leclercq.\n\n\nIn 2014 Peká Editorial released a board game based on the book, *Diez Negritos* (\"Ten Little Negroes\"), created by Judit Hurtado and Fernando Chavarría, and illustrated by Esperanza Peinado.[62]\n\n\nThe 2014 live action comedy-crime and murder mystery TV web series *Ten Little Roosters*, produced by American company Rooster Teeth, is largely inspired by *And Then There Were None.*[63]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** From *Zehn kleine Negerlein* to *Und dann gab's keines mehr*[31][32]\n2. **^** From *Tien kleine negertjes* to *En toen waren er nog maar...*[33]\n3. **^** From *Tio små negerpojkar* to *Och så var de bara en*[34]\n4. **^** From *O Caso dos Dez Negrinhos* to *E Não Sobrou Nenhum*[35]\n5. **^** From *Dziesięciu Murzynków* to *I nie było już nikogo*[36]\n6. **^** From *Dix petits nègres* to *Ils étaient dix*[37]\n7. **^** From *Desať malých černoškov* to *A napokon nezostal už nik*[39]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"British Library Item details\". *primocat.bl.uk*.

UK editions continued to use the original title until 1985.[7]\n\n\nThe book is the world's best-selling mystery, and with over 100 million copies sold is one of the best-selling books of all time. The novel has been listed as the sixth best-selling title (any language, including reference works).[8]\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nEight people arrive on a small, isolated island off the Devon coast, each having received an unexpected personal invitation. They are met by the butler and cook/housekeeper, Thomas and Ethel Rogers, who explain that their hosts, Ulick Norman Owen and Una Nancy Owen, have not yet arrived, though they have left instructions.\n\n\nA framed copy of an old rhyme hangs in every guest's room, and on the dining room table sit ten figurines. After supper, a phonograph record is played; the recording accuses each visitor and Mr and Mrs Rogers of having committed murder, then asks if any of the \"prisoners at the bar\" wishes to offer a defence.\n\n\nThe guests discover that none of them know the Owens, and Mr Justice Wargrave suggests that the name \"U N Owen\" is a play on \"Unknown\". Marston finishes his drink and promptly dies of cyanide poisoning. Dr Armstrong confirms that there was no cyanide in the other drinks and says that Marston must have dosed himself.\n\n\nThe next morning, Mrs Rogers is found dead in her bed. Suspecting that U N Owen may be systematically murdering them, three of the guests search the island, but find no hiding places. After General MacArthur dies from a heavy blow to the head, it is concluded that one of the seven remaining persons must be the killer. The next morning, Mr Rogers is found dead at the woodpile, and Emily Brent is found dead in the drawing room, having been injected with potassium cyanide. The manner of deaths appear to correspond with the rhyme, with one of the figurines being removed for each successive death.\n\n\nWargrave suggests searching the rooms, and Lombard's gun is found to be missing. Vera Claythorne goes up to her room and screams when she finds seaweed hanging from the ceiling. Most of the remaining guests rush upstairs; when they return they find Wargrave still downstairs in his chair, crudely dressed in the attire of a judge. Dr Armstrong pronounces him dead from a gunshot wound to the forehead.\n\n\nThat night, Lombard's gun is returned, and Blore sees someone leaving the house. Armstrong is absent from his room. Lombard and Blore search the island and the house, but do not find Armstrong. The next morning, Vera, Blore, and Lombard decide to stick together and leave the house. When Blore returns for food, he is killed by a marble clock shaped like a bear that is pushed from Vera's window sill. Vera and Lombard find Armstrong's body washed up on the beach, and each concludes the other must be responsible. Vera suggests moving the body from the shore as a mark of respect, but this is a pretext to acquire Lombard's gun. When Lombard lunges for it, she shoots him dead.\n\n\nVera returns to the house in a shaken, post-traumatic state. She finds a noose and chair arranged in her room. Overcome by guilt, she hangs herself in accordance with the last line of the rhyme.\n\n\nScotland Yard officials arrive on the island to find nobody alive. They discover that a sleazy lawyer and drug trafficker called Isaac Morris had arranged the invitations and ordered the recording. However, he had died of a barbiturate overdose on the night the guests arrived. The police reconstruct the deaths with the help of the victims' diaries and a coroner's report. They are able to eliminate several suspects due to the circumstances of their deaths and items being moved afterward, but ultimately they cannot identify the killer.\n\n\nMuch later, a trawler hauls up in its nets a bottle containing a written confession. In it, Mr Justice Wargrave recounts that all his life he had had two contradictory impulses: a strong sense of justice and a savage bloodlust. He had satisfied both through his profession as a criminal judge, sentencing murderers to death following their trial. After receiving a diagnosis of a terminal illness, he had decided on a private scheme to deal with a group of people he considered to have escaped justice.\n\n\nTo set up his scheme, Wargrave had employed an agent, Morris, to purchase the island and to make the necessary arrangements, before killing him with a lethal dose of barbiturates. Posing as one of the guests, he had with Dr Armstrong's naive assistance faked his own death by gunshot on the pretext that it would help the group identify the killer. After disposing of Armstrong and the remaining guests, and moving objects to confuse the police, he finally committed suicide by shooting himself in the head, using the gun and some elastic to ensure that his true death matched the account of his staged death recorded in the guests' diaries. Wargrave had written his confession and thrown it into the sea in a bottle in response to what he acknowledged to be his \"pitiful human need\" for recognition.\n\n\n\n## Principal characters[edit]\n\n\n* Edward George Armstrong - a Harley Street doctor\n* William Henry Blore - a former police inspector, now a private investigator\n* Emily Caroline Brent - an elderly, pious spinster\n* Vera Elizabeth Claythorne - a young woman on leave from her position as a sports mistress at a girls' school\n* Philip Lombard - a soldier of fortune\n* General John Gordon MacArthur - a retired World War I general\n* Anthony James Marston (Tony Marston) - an amoral and irresponsible young man\n* Ethel Rogers - the cook/housekeeper and Thomas Rogers' wife\n* Thomas Rogers - the butler and Ethel Rogers' husband\n* Lawrence John Wargrave (Mr Justice Wargrave) - a retired criminal judge\n\n\n## Structure of the novel[edit]\n\n\nThe plot is structured around the ten lines of the rhyme \"Ten Little Niggers\",[3] an 1869 minstrel song by the British songwriter Frank Green.[9] In later editions, the characters are replaced by \"Ten Little Indians\" or \"Ten Little Soldiers\". (Confusingly, the American songwriter Septimus Winner had published his own, quite different, minstrel song in 1868, called \"Ten Little Indians [or Injuns]\").[10][11]\n\n\nThis is the rhyme as published in a British 2008 edition:[12]\n\n\n\n\n> Ten little Soldier Boys went out to dine; One choked his little self and then there were nine.  \n> \n> Nine little Soldier Boys sat up very late; One overslept himself and then there were eight.  \n> \n> Eight little Soldier Boys travelling in Devon; One said he'd stay there and then there were seven.[13]  \n> \n> Seven little Soldier Boys chopping up sticks; One chopped himself in halves and then there were six.  \n> \n> Six little Soldier Boys playing with a hive; A bumblebee stung one and then there were five.  \n> \n> Five little Soldier Boys going in for law; One got in Chancery and then there were four.  \n> \n> Four little Soldier Boys going out to sea; A red herring swallowed one and then there were three.  \n> \n> Three little Soldier Boys walking in the zoo; A big bear hugged one and then there were two.  \n> \n> Two little Soldier Boys sitting in the sun; One got frizzled up and then there was one.  \n> \n> One little Soldier Boy left all alone; He went out and hanged himself and then there were none.\n> \n\n\nEach of the ten victims – eight guests plus the island's two caretakers – is killed in a manner that reflects one of the lines of the rhyme. A lawyer who helped arrange the affair is also killed during this time, but his killing occurs on the mainland and outside of the story.\n\n\n\n### Correspondence between rhyme and modes of death[edit]\n\n\n\n\nModes of death of the victims vs the wording of the rhyme\n| No.\n | Character\n | Accusation\n | Mode of death\n | Original rhyme, early UK editions[14] | Current version of the rhyme[12] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| -\n | **Isaac Morris** (Wargrave's agent)\n | Sold illegal drugs to a woman who became an addict and later committed suicide\n | Tricked into taking a lethal drug overdose to combat his imagined ailments\n |  |  |\n| 1\n | **Anthony James Marston** | Struck and killed two young children while recklessly speeding\n | Chokes to death after drinking cyanide-laced whisky\n | Ten little nigger boys went out to dine;\nOne choked his little self and then there were Nine.\n | Ten little Soldier Boys went out to dine;\nOne choked his little self and then there were nine.\n |\n| 2\n | **Mrs Ethel Rogers** | Allowed herself to be persuaded by her husband into withholding a former employer's medicine in order to cause her death and collect an inheritance\n | Dies in her sleep after drinking brandy spiked with an overdose of chloral hydrate | Nine little nigger boys sat up very late;\nOne overslept himself and then there were Eight.\n | Nine little Soldier Boys sat up very late;\nOne overslept himself and then there were eight.\n |\n| 3\n | **General John Gordon MacArthur** | Discovered that his wife was having an affair with an officer under his command, then sent the man on a mission to almost certain death\n | Killed by a heavy blow to the head\n | Eight little nigger boys travelling in Devon;\nOne said he'd stay there and then there were Seven.\n | Eight little Soldier Boys travelling in Devon;\nOne said he'd stay there and then there were seven.[13]\n |\n| 4\n | **Thomas Rogers** | Induced his wife to withhold a former employer's medicine in order to cause her death and collect an inheritance\n | Killed with an axe while chopping wood\n | Seven little nigger boys chopping up sticks;\nOne chopped himself in halves and then there were Six.\n | Seven little Soldier Boys chopping up sticks;\nOne chopped himself in halves and then there were six.\n |\n| 5\n | **Emily Caroline Brent** | Dismissed her teenage maid for becoming pregnant out of wedlock, this causing the maid to drown herself\n | Injected with cyanide after drinking chloral-laced coffee\n | Six little nigger boys playing with a hive;\nA bumble-bee stung one and then there were Five.\n | Six little Soldier Boys playing with a hive;\nA bumblebee stung one and then there were five.\n |\n| 6\n | **Lawrence John Wargrave (Mr Justice Wargrave)** | Improperly influenced a jury to bring in a guilty verdict against a man many thought to be innocent, then sentenced him to death\n | Gunshot wound to the head, while dressed as a judge\n | Five little nigger boys going in for law;\nOne got in Chancery and then there were Four.\n | Five little Soldier Boys going in for law;\nOne got in Chancery and then there were four.\n |\n| 7\n | **Dr Edward George Armstrong** | Operated on a patient while drunk, resulting in her death\n | Drowns after being pushed off a cliff into the sea\n | Four little nigger boys going out to sea;\nA red herring swallowed one and then there were Three.\n | Four little Soldier Boys going out to sea;\nA red herring swallowed one and then there were three.\n |\n| 8\n | **William Henry Blore** | Gave perjured evidence in court resulting in an innocent man being convicted and sentenced to life in prison, where he died a year later\n | Head crushed by a marble clock shaped like a bear\n | Three little nigger boys walking in the zoo;\nA big bear hugged one and then there were Two.\n | Three little Soldier Boys walking in the zoo;\nA big bear hugged one and then there were two.\n |\n| 9\n | **Philip Lombard** | As a soldier of Fortune, stole food from a group of East African tribesmen he was working with, then left them to die\n | Shot by Vera on the beach with his own revolver\n | Two little nigger boys sitting in the sun;\nOne got frizzled up and then there was One.\n | Two little Soldier Boys sitting in the sun;\nOne got frizzled up and then there was one.\n |\n| 10\n | **Vera Elizabeth Claythorne** | As a governess, allowed her young charge to drown so that his uncle could inherit the family estate and marry her\n | Hangs herself\n | One little nigger boy left all alone;\nHe went and hanged himself and then there were None.\n | One little Soldier Boy left all alone;\nHe went out and hanged himself and then there were none.\n |\n\n\n## Literary significance and reception[edit]\n\n\nWriting for *The Times Literary Supplement* of 11 November 1939, Maurice Percy Ashley stated, \"If her latest story has scarcely any detection in it there is no scarcity of murders... There is a certain feeling of monotony inescapable in the regularity of the deaths which is better suited to a serialized newspaper story than a full-length novel. Yet there is an ingenious problem to solve in naming the murderer\", he continued. \"It will be an extremely astute reader who guesses correctly.\"[15]\n\n\nFor *The New York Times Book Review* (25 February 1940), Isaac Anderson has arrived to the point where \"the voice\" accuses the ten \"guests\" of their past crimes, which have all resulted in the deaths of humans, and then said, \"When you read what happens after that you will not believe it, but you will keep on reading, and as one incredible event is followed by another even more incredible you will still keep on reading. The whole thing is utterly impossible and utterly fascinating. It is the most baffling mystery that Agatha Christie has ever written, and if any other writer has ever surpassed it for sheer puzzlement the name escapes our memory. We are referring, of course, to mysteries that have logical explanations, as this one has. It is a tall story, to be sure, but it could have happened.\"[16]\n\n\nMany compared the book to her 1926 novel *The Murder of Roger Ackroyd*. For instance, an unnamed reviewer in the *Toronto Daily Star* of 16 March 1940 said, \"Others have written better mysteries than Agatha Christie, but no one can touch her for ingenious plot and surprise ending. With *And Then There Were None*... she is at her most ingenious and most surprising... is, indeed, considerably above the standard of her last few works and close to the *Roger Ackroyd* level.\"[17]\n\n\nOther critics laud the use of plot twists and surprise endings. Maurice Richardson wrote a rhapsodic review in *The Observer*'s issue of 5 November 1939 which began, \"No wonder Agatha Christie's latest has sent her publishers into a vatic trance. We will refrain, however, from any invidious comparisons with *Roger Ackroyd* and be content with saying that *Ten Little Niggers* is one of the very best, most genuinely bewildering Christies yet written. We will also have to refrain from reviewing it thoroughly, as it is so full of shocks that even the mildest revelation would spoil some surprise from somebody, and I am sure that you would rather have your entertainment kept fresh than criticism pure.\" After stating the set-up of the plot, Richardson concluded, \"Story telling and characterisation are right at the top of Mrs Christie's baleful form. Her plot may be highly artificial, but it is neat, brilliantly cunning, soundly constructed, and free from any of those red-herring false trails which sometimes disfigure her work.\"[3]\n\n\nRobert Barnard, writing in 1990, concurred with the early reviews, describing the book as \"Suspenseful and menacing detective-story-cum-thriller. The closed setting with the succession of deaths is here taken to its logical conclusion, and the dangers of ludicrousness and sheer reader-disbelief are skillfully avoided. Probably the best-known Christie, and justifiably among the most popular.\"[18]\n\n\nThe original title of the mystery (*Ten Little Niggers*) was changed because it was offensive. Alison Light, a literary critic and feminist scholar, opined that Christie's original title and the setting on \"Nigger Island\" (later changed to \"Indian Island\" and \"Soldier Island\", variously) were integral to the work. These aspects of the novel, she argued, \"could be relied upon automatically to conjure up a thrilling 'otherness', a place where revelations about the 'dark side' of the English would be appropriate.\"[19] Unlike novels such as *Heart of Darkness*, \"Christie's location is both more domesticated and privatized, taking for granted the construction of racial fears woven into psychic life as early as the nursery. If her story suggests how easy it is to play upon such fears, it is also a reminder of how intimately tied they are to sources of pleasure and enjoyment.\"[19]\n\n\nIn 1990 Crime Writers' Association ranked *And Then There Were None* 19th in their The Top 100 Crime Novels of All Time list. In 1995 in a similar list Mystery Writers of America ranked the novel 10th.[20] In September 2015, to mark her 125th birthday, *And Then There Were None* was named the \"World's Favourite Christie\" in a vote sponsored by the author's estate.[21][22]\n\n\nIn the \"Binge!\" article of *Entertainment Weekly* Issue #1343-44 (26 December 2014–3 January 2015), the writers picked *And Then There Were None* as an \"EW favorite\" on the list of the \"Nine Great Christie Novels\".[23]\n\n\n\n### Christie's own assessment[edit]\n\n\n\"I had written the book *Ten Little Niggers* because it was so difficult to do that the idea had fascinated me. Ten people had to die without it becoming ridiculous or the murderer being obvious. I wrote the book after a tremendous amount of planning, and I was pleased with what I had made of it. It was clear, straightforward, baffling, and yet had a perfectly reasonable explanation; in fact, it had to have an epilogue in order to explain it. It was well received and reviewed, but the person who was really pleased with it was myself, for I knew better than any critic how difficult it had been... I don't say it is the play or book of mine that I like best, or even that I think it is my best, but I do think in some ways that it is a better piece of craftsmanship than anything else I have written.\"[24]\n\n\n\n## Publication[edit]\n\n\nThe novel has a long and noteworthy history of publication. It is a continuously best selling novel in English and in translation to other languages since its initial publication. From the start, in English, it was published under two different titles, due to different sensitivity to the author's title in the UK and in the US at first publication.\n\n\nThe novel was originally published in late 1939 and early 1940 almost simultaneously, in the United Kingdom and the United States. The serialization was in 23 parts in the *Daily Express* from Tuesday 6 June to Saturday 1 July 1939. All of the instalments carried an illustration by \"Prescott\" with the first having an illustration of Burgh Island in Devon which inspired the setting of the story. The serialized version did not contain any chapter divisions.[25] The book retailed for seven shillings and sixpence.\n\n\n\n### Title[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cover of first US 1940 edition with current title for all English-language versions.\nIn the UK the book first appeared under the title *Ten Little Niggers*, in book and newspaper serialized formats. In the United States it was published under the title *And Then There Were None*, in both book and serial formats. Both of the original US publications changed the title from that originally used in the UK, due to the offensiveness of the word in American culture, where it was more widely perceived as a racially loaded ethnic slur or insult compared to the contemporaneous culture in the United Kingdom. The serialized version appeared in the *Saturday Evening Post* in seven parts from 20 May (Volume 211, Number 47) to 1 July 1939 (Volume 212, Number 1) with illustrations by Henry Raleigh, and the book was published in January 1940 by Dodd, Mead and Company for $2.[4][5][6]\n\n\nIn the original UK novel, and in succeeding publications until 1985, all references to \"Indians\" or \"Soldiers\" were originally \"Nigger\", including the island's name, the pivotal rhyme found by the visitors, and the ten figurines.[5] UK editions continued to use the original title until the current definitive title appeared with a reprint of the 1963 Fontana Paperback in 1985.[7]\n\n\nThe word \"nigger\" was already racially offensive in the United States by the start of the 20th century, and therefore the book's first US edition (1940) and first serialization changed the title to *And Then There Were None* and removed all references to the word from the book, as did the 1945 motion picture (except that the first US edition retained 'nigger in the woodpile' in Chapter 2 Part VII and Chapter 7 Part III). Sensitivity to the original title of the novel was remarked by Sadie Stein in 2016, commenting on a BBC mini series with the title *And Then There Were None*, where she noted that \"even in 1939, this title was considered too offensive for American publication.\"[26] In general, \"Christie’s work is not known for its racial sensitivity, and by modern standards her oeuvre is rife with casual Orientalism.\"[26] The original title was based on a rhyme from minstrel shows and children's games. Stein quotes Alison Light as to the power of the original name of the island in the novel, Nigger Island, \"to conjure up a thrilling 'otherness', a place where revelations about the 'dark side' of the English would be appropriate\".[27] Light goes on to say that \"Christie's location [the island] is both more domesticated and privatised, taking for granted the construction of racial fears woven into psychic life as early as the nursery.\"[27] Speaking of the \"widely known\" 1945 film, Stein added that \"we’re merely faced with fantastic amounts of violence, and a rhyme so macabre and distressing one doesn't hear it now outside of the Agatha Christie context.\"[26] She felt that the original title of the novel in the UK, seen now, \"jars, viscerally\".[26]\n\n\n\n### Best-selling crime novel[edit]\n\n\n*And Then There Were None* is the best-selling crime novel of all time, and made Agatha Christie the best-selling novelist, according to the Agatha Christie Estate.[2]\n\n\nIt is Christie's best-selling novel, with more than 100 million copies sold; it is also the world's best-selling mystery and one of the best-selling books of all time. Publications International lists the novel as the sixth best-selling title.[8]\n\n\n\n### Editions in English[edit]\n\n\nThe book and its adaptations have been released under various new names since the original publication, including *Ten Little Indians* (1946 play, Broadway performance and 1964 paperback book), *Ten Little Soldiers,* and official title per the Agatha Christie Limited website, *And Then There Were None*.[2] UK editions continued to use the work's original title until the 1980s; the first UK edition to use the alternative title *And Then There Were None* appeared in 1985 with a reprint of the 1963 Fontana Paperback.[7]\n\n\n\n* Christie, Agatha (November 1939). *Ten Little Niggers*.

Last publication of novel under the title *Ten Little Indians*.\n\n\n### Foreign-language editions[edit]\n\n\nMany older translations were based on the original British text, although the word used to translate *nigger* was often somewhat less offensive, more analogous to English *negro* or *negrito*. Languages where the most recent edition retains racial epithets include Spanish, Greek, Serbian, Bulgarian, Romanian,[29][*better source needed*] Russian[30] and Hungarian, as well as the 1987 Soviet film adaptation *Desyat Negrityat*. Changes similar to those in the British edition in the 1980s were made to the German novel in 2003,[n 1] after 2002 protests in Hanover against a stage version using the old title.[31] Similar changes were made in Dutch in 2004,[n 2] Swedish in 2007,[n 3] Brazilian Portuguese in 2009,[n 4] Polish in 2017,[n 5] French in 2020,[n 6] and Turkish in 2022.[38] In 1999, the Slovak National Theatre changed the title of a stage adaptation mid-run.[n 7] The estate of Agatha Christie now offers it under only one title in English, *And Then There Were None*,[2] and translations increasingly use the equivalent of this as their title.[35] European Portuguese translations have been titled *Convite Para a Morte* (1948: \"An Invitation to Death\") and *As Dez Figuras Negras* (2011: \"The Ten Black Figures\" – referring to the figurines, in this case minimally anthropomorphic).[35] The Finnish translation *Eikä yksikään pelastunut* (\"No one was saved\") in 1940 had its title taken from the American first edition, before being renamed *Kymmenen pientä neekeripoikaa* (\"Ten little negro boys\") in 1968. This change was reversed in 2003.[40]\n\n\n\n## Possible inspirations[edit]\n\n\nThe 1930 novel *The Invisible Host* by Gwen Bristow and Bruce Manning has a plot that strongly matches that of Christie's later novel, including a recorded voice announcing to the guests that their sins will be visited upon them by death. *The Invisible Host* was adapted as the 1930 Broadway play *The Ninth Guest* by Owen Davis,[41] which itself was adapted as the 1934 film *The Ninth Guest*. There is no evidence Christie saw either the play (which had a brief run on Broadway) or the film.\n\n\nThe 1933 K.B.S. Productions Sherlock Holmes film *A Study in Scarlet* follows a strikingly similar plot;[42] the victims are tormented by slips of paper inspired by the same poem as Christie's, one says \"Six Little Black Boys | Playing With a Hive | A Bumble-Bee Stung One | And Then There Were Five.\" And it anticipates the largest plot twist in Christie's book, the killer turns out to be one of the \"victims\" who had already been identified as dead. The film retained no plot points from Arthur Conan Doyle's original story of the same name. The author of the movie's screenplay, Robert Florey, \"doubted that [Christie] had seen *A Study in Scarlet*, but he regarded it as a compliment if it had helped inspire her\".[43]\n\n\n\n## Adaptations[edit]\n\n\n*And Then There Were None* has had more adaptations than any other work by Agatha Christie.[2] Christie herself changed the bleak ending to a more palatable one for theatre audiences when she adapted the novel for the stage in 1943. Many adaptations incorporate changes to the story, such as using Christie's alternative ending from her stage play or changing the setting to locations other than an island.\n\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\nThere have been numerous film adaptations of the novel:\n\n\n\n* *And Then There Were None* (1945 film), American film by René Clair\n* *Ten Little Indians* (1965 film), British film directed by George Pollock and produced by Harry Alan Towers; Pollock had previously handled four Miss Marple films starring Margaret Rutherford. Set in a mountain retreat in Austria.\n* *Gumnaam* (1965, translation: *Unknown* or *Anonymous*), an Indian suspense thriller. This loose, uncredited Hindi film adaptation added the characteristic \"Bollywood\" elements of comedy, music and dance to Christie's plot.[44]\n* *Nadu Iravil* (1970, translation: *In the middle of the night*), a Tamil adaptation directed by S. Balachander[45]\n* *And Then There Were None* (1974), the first English-language colour version, directed by Peter Collinson and produced by Harry Alan Towers. Based on a screenplay by Towers (writing as \"Peter Welbeck\"), who co-wrote the screenplay for the 1965 film. Set at a grand hotel in the Iranian desert.\n* *Ten Little Maidens*, a 1985 adult film starring Nina Hartley, Amber Lynn, Eric Edwards, Harry Reems and Ginger Lynn\n* *Desyat' Negrityat* (1987, *Десять негритят*, Eng: \"Ten Little Negroes\") a Russian adaptation produced/directed by Stanislav Govorukhin, notable for being the first cinema adaptation to keep the novel's original plot and grim ending.\n* *Ten Little Indians*, a 1989 British version, produced by Harry Alan Towers and directed by Alan Birkinshaw, set on safari in the African savannah\n* *Aduthathu*, a 2012 Tamil adaptation[46]\n* *Aatagara*, a 2015 Kannada adaptation[47]\n\n\n### Radio[edit]\n\n\nThe BBC broadcast *Ten Little Niggers* (1947), adapted by Ayton Whitaker, first aired as a Monday Matinee on the BBC Home Service on 27 December 1947 and as *Saturday Night Theatre* on the BBC Light Programme on 29 December.[48]\n\n\nOn 13 November 2010, as part of its *Saturday Play* series, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a 90-minute adaptation written by Joy Wilkinson. The production was directed by Mary Peate and featured Geoffrey Whitehead as Mr Justice Wargrave, Lyndsey Marshal as Vera Claythorne, Alex Wyndham as Philip Lombard, John Rowe as Dr Armstrong, and Joanna Monro as Emily Brent.\n\n\n\n### Stage[edit]\n\n\n*And Then There Were None* (1943 play) is Christie's adaptation of the story for the stage. She and the producers agreed that audiences might not flock to a tale with such a grim ending as the novel, nor would it work well dramatically as there would be no one left to tell the story. Christie reworked the ending for Lombard and Vera to be innocent of the crimes of which they were accused, survive, and fall in love with each other. Some of the names were also changed, e.g., General MacArthur became General McKenzie in both the New York and London productions.[49][50] By 1943, General Douglas MacArthur was playing a prominent role in the Pacific Theatre of World War II, which may explain the change of the character's name.\n\n\n*Ten Little Niggers* (1944 play): Dundee Repertory Theatre Company was given special permission to restore the original ending of the novel. The company first performed a stage adaptation of the novel in August 1944 under the UK title of the novel, with Christie credited as the dramatist.[51] It was the first performance in repertory theatre.[51] It was staged again in 1965.[52] There was an article in the *Dundee Evening Register* in August 1944 about it.\n\n\n*And Then There Were None* (2005 play): On 14 October 2005, a new version of the play, written by Kevin Elyot and directed by Steven Pimlott, opened at the Gielgud Theatre in London. For this version, Elyot returned to the original story in the novel, restoring the nihilism of the original.[53]\n\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\nSeveral variations of the original novel were adapted for television, three of which were British adaptations. The first of these, in 1949, was produced by the BBC.[54] The second was produced in 1959,[55] by ITV. Both of those productions aired with Christie's original title. The third and most recent British adaptation aired as *And Then There Were None* on BBC One in December 2015, as a drama serial broadcast on three consecutive nights, produced in cooperation with Acorn Media and Agatha Christie Productions. The 2015 production adhered more closely to the original plot, though there were several differences to backstories and actual murders on the island, and was the first English language live-action adaptation to feature an ending similar to that of the novel. It was directed by Craig Viveiros and adapted for television by Sarah Phelps.[56]\n\n\nAn American TV movie aired on NBC 18 January 1959. It was directed by Paul Bogart, and starred Barry Jones and Nina Foch.\n\n\nThere have been many foreign-language TV adaptations:\n\n\n\n* A Portuguese-language version for Brazilian television, broadcast 16 February 1957, titled *O Caso dos Dez Negrinhos*\n* *O Caso dos Dez Negrinhos*, a 1963 episode of the Brazilian anthology series *Grande Teatro Tupi [pt]*\n* A West German television production, *Zehn kleine Negerlein*, which aired in 1969\n* *Dix petits nègres*, a 1970 episode of the French anthology series *Au théâtre ce soir [fr]*\n* *Achra Abid Zghar* (1974, translation: *Ten Little Slaves*), a Télé Liban TV series directed by Jean Fayyad, adapted for television by Latifeh Moultaka\n* *Deka Mikroi Negroi*, a 1978 episode of the Greek anthology series *To theatro tis Defteras*\n* A free Spanish adaptation made by RTVE in 2011 as the two-parter *The mystery of the ten strangers* for the second season of *Los misterios de Laura* (part 1 and part 2)\n* *Achra Abid Zghar* (2014, translation: *Ten Little Slaves*), an MTV Lebanon television production\n* *Soshite daremo inakunatta* (そして誰もいなくなった), a two-part Japanese-language adaptation by Shukei Nagasaka (長坂秀佳, *Nagasaka Shukei*) set in modern times, aired 25 and 26 March 2017 on TV Asahi in Japan. It was directed by Seiji Izumi and adapted for television by Hideka Nagasaka.[57][58]\n* *Ils étaient dix [fr]*, a French six-part miniseries produced by M6 and aired in 2020, set on a tropical island in present time\n\n\nIn 2010, American animated TV series *Family Guy* adapted the story as \"And Then There Were Fewer\".[59]\n\n\n\n### Other media[edit]\n\n\nThe novel was the inspiration for several video games. For the Apple II, Online Systems released *Mystery House* in 1980. On the PC, The Adventure Company released *Agatha Christie: And Then There Were None* in 2005, the first in a series of PC games based on Christie novels. In February 2008, it was ported to the Wii console.[60]\n\n\nThe Japanese visual novel series *Umineko When They Cry* also drew inspiration from the novel on many fronts. Both stories involve a series of murders on an island during a storm intended to be unsolvable murders where everyone on the island dies. There is a poem that foretells the series of deaths beforehand in both as well. Finally, the solution to both mysteries are tossed into the ocean in the form of messages in a bottle for the reader to learn from at the end of the stories.

One of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature, it is known for its psychological scope, and its observation of the worldview, aesthetics, lifestyles, and social relations of 18th-century China.[1]\n\n\nThe intricate strands of its plot depict the rise and decline of a family much like Cao's own and, by extension, of the dynasty itself. Cao depicts the power of the father over the family, but the novel is intended to be a memorial to the women he knew in his youth: friends, relatives and servants. At a more profound level, the author explores religious and philosophical questions, and the writing style includes echoes of the plays and novels of the late Ming, as well as poetry from earlier periods.[2]\n\n\nCao apparently began composing it in the 1740s and worked on it until his death in 1763 or 1764. Copies of his uncompleted manuscript circulated in Cao's social circle, under the title *Story of a Stone*, in slightly varying versions of eighty chapters. It was not published until nearly three decades after Cao's death, when Gao E and Cheng Weiyuan (程偉元), edited the first and second printed editions under the title *Dream of the Red Chamber* in 1791–92, adding 40 chapters. It is still debated whether Gao and Cheng composed these chapters themselves and the extent to which they did or did not represent Cao's intentions. Their 120-chapter edition became the most widely circulated version.[3] The title has also been translated as *Red Chamber Dream* and *A Dream of Red Mansions*. \"Redology\" is the field of study devoted to the novel.\n\n\n\n\n## Language[edit]\n\n\nThe novel is composed in written vernacular (*baihua*) rather than Classical Chinese (*wenyan*). Cao Xueqin was well versed in Chinese poetry and in Classical Chinese, having written tracts in the semi-*wenyan* style, while the novel's dialogue is written in the Beijing Mandarin dialect, which was to become the basis of modern spoken Chinese. In the early 20th century, lexicographers used the text to establish the vocabulary of the new standardised language and reformers used the novel to promote the written vernacular.[4]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Textual history[edit]\n\n\n*Dream of the Red Chamber* has a complicated textual history that scholars and historians have long debated.[5] It is known with certainty that Cao Xueqin began writing *Dream of the Red Chamber* in the 1740s.[5] Cao was a member of a prominent Chinese family that had served the Manchu emperors of the Qing dynasty but whose fortunes had begun to decline. By the time of Cao's death in 1763 or 1764, hand-copied manuscripts of the novel's first 80 chapters had begun circulating, and Cao may have made early drafts of the remaining chapters.[5]\nThese hand-copied manuscripts circulated first among his personal friends and a growing circle of aficionados, then eventually on the open market where they sold for large sums of money.[6][7]\n\n\nThe first printed version of *Dream of the Red Chamber*, published by Cheng Weiyuan and Gao E in 1791, contains edits and revisions that Cao never authorized.[3] It is possible that Cao destroyed the last chapters[8] or that at least parts of Cao's original ending were incorporated into the 120 chapter Cheng-Gao versions,[9] with Gao E's \"careful emendations\" of Cao's draft.[10]\n\n\n\n#### \"Rouge\" versions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A page from the \"Jimao manuscript\" (one of the Rouge versions) of the novel, 1759.[11]\nUp until 1791, the novel circulated in hand-copied manuscripts. Even amongst some 12 independent surviving manuscripts, small differences in some characters, rearrangements and possible rewritings cause the texts to vary a little. The earliest manuscripts end abruptly at the latest at the 80th chapter. The earlier versions contain comments and annotations in red or black ink from unknown commentators. These commentators' remarks reveal much about the author as a person, and it is now believed that some of them may even be members of Cao Xueqin's own family. The most prominent commentator is Zhiyanzhai, who revealed much of the interior structuring of the work and the original manuscript ending, now lost. These manuscripts, the most textually reliable versions, are known as \"rouge versions\" (*zhī běn* 脂本).\n\n\nThe early 80 chapters brim with prophecies and dramatic foreshadowings that give hints as to how the book would continue. For example, it is obvious that Lin Daiyu will eventually die in the course of the novel; that Baoyu and Baochai will marry; that Baoyu will become a monk. A branch of Redology, known as *tànyì xué* (探佚學), is focused on recovering the lost manuscript ending, based on the commentators' annotations in the Rouge versions, as well as the internal foreshadowings in the earlier 80 chapters.\n\n\nSeveral early manuscripts are still extant. At the present, the \"Jiaxu manuscript\" (dating to 1754) is held in the Shanghai Museum, the \"Jimao manuscript\" (1759) is held in the National Library of China, and the \"Gengchen manuscript\" (1760) is held in the library of Peking University. Beijing Normal University and the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences both also held manuscripts of the novel that predate the first printed edition of 1791.\n\n\n\n* ![The \"Jiaxu manuscript\", 1754](image)\n\nThe \"Jiaxu manuscript\", 1754\n* ![The \"Gengchen manuscript\", 1760](image)\n\nThe \"Gengchen manuscript\", 1760\n\n\n#### Cheng–Gao versions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cheng-Gao versions\n\nIn 1791, Gao E and Cheng Weiyuan brought out the novel's first printed edition. This was also the first \"complete\" edition of *The Story of the Stone*, which they printed as the *Illustrated Dream of the Red Chamber* (*Xiùxiàng Hóng Lóu Mèng* 繡像紅樓夢). While the original Rouge manuscripts have eighty chapters, the 1791 edition completed the novel in 120 chapters. The first 80 chapters were edited from the Rouge versions, but the last 40 were newly published.[12]\n\n\nIn 1792, Cheng and Gao published a second edition correcting editorial errors of the 1791 version. In the 1791 prefaces, Cheng claimed to have put together an ending based on the author's working manuscripts.[10]\n\n\nThe debate over the last 40 chapters and the 1791–92 prefaces continues to this day. Many modern scholars believe these chapters were a later addition. Hu Shih, in his *Studies on A Dream of the Red Chamber* (1921) argued that these chapters were written by Gao E, citing the foreshadowing of the main characters' fates in Chapter 5, which differs from the ending of the 1791 Cheng-Gao version. However, during the mid-20th century, the discovery of a 120 chapter manuscript that dates well before 1791 further complicated the questions regarding Gao E and Cheng Weiyuan's involvement—whether they simply edited or actually wrote the continuation of the novel.[13] Though it is unclear if the last 40 chapters of the discovered manuscript contained the original works of Cao, Irene Eber found the discovery \"seems to confirm Cheng and Gao's claim that they merely edited a complete manuscript, consisting of 120 chapters, rather than actually writing a portion of the novel\".[13]\n\n\nThe book is usually published and read in Cheng Weiyuan and Gao E's 120 chapter version. Some modern editions, such as Zhou Ruchang's, do not include the last 40 chapters.\n\n\nIn 2014, three researchers using data analysis of writing styles announced that \"Applying our method to the Cheng–Gao version of *Dream of the Red Chamber* has led to convincing if not irrefutable evidence that the first 80 chapters and the last 40 chapters of the book were written by two different authors.\"[14]\n\n\nIn 2020, Zhang Qingshan, the president of the academic organization Society of the Dream of the Red Chamber, stated that although the authorship of the novel's last 40 chapters remains uncertain, it is unlikely Gao E was the one who wrote them.[15]\n\n\n\n## Plot summary[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A piece from a series of brush paintings by the Qing dynasty artist Sun Wen (1818–1904), depicting a scene from the novel.\nIn the novel's frame story, a sentient Stone, left over when the goddess Nüwa mended the heaven aeons ago, wants to enjoy the pleasures of the \"red dust\" (the mundane world). The Stone begs a Taoist priest and a Buddhist monk to take it with them to see the world. The Stone, along with a companion (in Cheng-Gao versions they are merged into the same character), is then given a chance to learn from human existence, and enters the mortal realm, reborn as Jia Baoyu (\"Precious Jade\") – thus \"The Story of the Stone\".\n\n\nThe novel provides a detailed, episodic record of life in the two branches of the wealthy, aristocratic Jia (賈) clan—the Rongguo House (榮國府) and the Ningguo House (寧國府)—who reside in large, adjacent family compounds in the capital. The capital, however, is not named, and the first chapter insists that the dynasty is indeterminate.[16] The ancestors of the two families were made Chinese nobility and given imperial titles, and as the novel begins the two houses are among the most illustrious families in the city. One of the Jia daughters is made a Royal Consort, and to suitably receive her, the family constructs the Daguanyuan, a lush landscaped garden, the setting for much of subsequent action. The novel describes the Jias' wealth and influence in great naturalistic detail, and charts the Jias' fall from the height of their prestige, following some thirty main characters and over four hundred minor ones.\n\n\nAs the carefree adolescent male heir of the family, Baoyu in this life has a special bond with his sickly cousin Lin Daiyu, who shares his love of music and poetry. Baoyu, however, is predestined to marry another cousin, Xue Baochai, whose grace and intelligence exemplify an ideal woman, but with whom he lacks an emotional connection. The romantic rivalry and friendship among the three characters against the backdrop of the family's declining fortunes form the central story.\n\n\n\nA series of paintings by Fei Danxu (1801–1850) depicting scenes from the novel.\n\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n\n\n## Characters[edit]\n\n\n![](image)1889 woodcut print depicting Xue Baochai chasing butterflies (chapter 27).\n*Dream of the Red Chamber* contains an extraordinarily large number of characters: nearly 40 are considered major characters, and there are over 400 additional ones.[17] The novel is also known for the complex portraits of its many women characters.[18] According to Lu Xun in the appendix to *A Brief History of Chinese Fiction*, *Dream of the Red Chamber* broke every conceivable thought and technique in traditional Chinese fiction; its realistic characterization presents thoroughly human characters who are neither \"wholly good nor wholly bad\", but who seem to inhabit part of the real world.[19]\n\n\nThe names of the characters present a challenge to the translator, since many of them convey meaning. David Hawkes left the names of the masters, mistresses, and their family members in pinyin (Jia Zheng and Lady Wang, for instance); translated the meanings of the servants's names, (such as Aroma and Skybright); and put the names of the Daoists and Buddhists into Latin (Sapientia); and those of actors and actresses into French.[20]\n\n\n\n### Jia Baoyu and the Twelve Beauties of Jinling[edit]\n\n\n* **Jia Baoyu** (traditional Chinese: 賈寶玉; simplified Chinese: 贾宝玉; pinyin: *Jiǎ Bǎoyù*; Wade–Giles: *Chia Pao-yu*; lit. 'Precious Jade')   \nThe main protagonist is about 12 or 13 years old when introduced in the novel.[21] The adolescent son of Jia Zheng and his wife, Lady Wang, and born with a piece of luminescent jade in his mouth (the Stone), Baoyu is the heir apparent to the Rongguo House. Frowned on by his strict Confucian father, Baoyu reads *Zhuangzi* and *Romance of the Western Chamber* on the sly, rather than the Four Books of classic Chinese education. Baoyu is highly intelligent, but dislikes the fawning bureaucrats who frequent his father's house. A sensitive and compassionate individual, he has a special relationship with many of the women in the house.\n* **Lin Daiyu** (林黛玉; *Lín Dàiyù*; *Lin Tai-yu*; 'Blue-black Jade')   \nJia Baoyu's younger first cousin and his true love. She is the daughter of Lin Ruhai (林如海), an official in the lucrative Yangzhou salt commission, and Lady Jia Min (賈敏), Baoyu's paternal aunt. She is an icon of spirituality and intelligence: beautiful, sentimental, sarcastic, self-assured, an accomplished poet, but subject to fits of jealousy. She suffers from a respiratory ailment. In the frame story, Baoyu, in his previous incarnation as the Deity Shenying, watered Fairy Crimson Pearl, Daiyu's incarnation. The purpose of her mortal reincarnation is to repay Baoyu with tears. The novel proper starts in Chapter 3 with Daiyu's arrival at the Rongguo House shortly after the death of her mother.[22]\n* **Xue Baochai** (薛寶釵; 薛宝钗; *Xuē Bǎochāi*; *Hsueh Pao-chai*; 'Jeweled Hair Pin')   \nJia Baoyu's other first cousin. The only daughter of Aunt Xue (薛姨媽}), sister to Baoyu's mother, Baochai is a foil to Daiyu. Where Daiyu is unconventional and sincere, Baochai is worldly-wise and very tactful: a model Chinese feudal maiden. The novel describes her as beautiful and ambitious. Baochai has a round face, fair skin, large eyes, and, some would say, a more voluptuous figure in contrast to Daiyu's slender willowy daintiness. Baochai carries a golden locket with her which contains words given to her in childhood by a Buddhist monk. Baochai's golden locket and Baoyu's jade contain inscriptions that appear to complement one another perfectly in the material world. Her marriage to Baoyu is seen in the book as predestined, but ultimately fails due to Baoyu's love for Daiyu persisting after her death.\n* **Jia Yuanchun** (賈元春; 贾元春; *Jiǎ Yuánchūn*; *Chia Yuan-chun*; 'First Spring')   \nBaoyu's elder sister by about a decade. Originally one of the ladies-in-waiting in the imperial palace, Yuanchun later becomes an Imperial Consort, having impressed the Emperor with her virtue and learning. Her illustrious position as a favorite of the Emperor marks the height of the Jia family's powers. Despite her prestigious position, Yuanchun feels imprisoned within the imperial palace, and dies at the age of forty. The name of four sisters together \"Yuan-Ying-Tan-Xi\" is a homophone with \"Supposed to sigh\".\n* **Jia Tanchun** (賈探春; 贾探春; *Jiǎ Tànchūn*; *Chia Tan-chun*; 'Seeking Spring')   \nBaoyu's younger half-sister by Concubine Zhao. Extremely outspoken, she is almost as capable as Wang Xifeng. Wang Xifeng herself compliments her privately, but laments that she was \"born in the wrong womb\", since concubine children are not respected as much as those by first wives. She is also a very talented poet. Tanchun is nicknamed \"Rose\" for her beauty and her prickly personality. She later marries into a military family on the South Sea far away from home.\n* **Shi Xiangyun** (史湘雲; 史湘云; *Shǐ Xiāngyún*; *Shih Hsiang-yun*; 'Xiang River Clouds')   \n Jia Baoyu's younger second cousin. Grandmother Jia's grandniece. Orphaned in infancy, she grows up under her wealthy paternal uncle and aunt who treats her unkindly. In spite of this Xiangyun is openhearted and cheerful. A comparatively androgynous beauty, Xiangyun looks good in men's clothes (once she put on Baoyu's clothes and Grandmother Jia thought she was a man), and loves to drink. She is forthright and without tact, but her forgiving nature takes the sting from her casually truthful remarks. She is well educated and as talented a poet as Daiyu or Baochai. Her young husband dies shortly after their marriage. She vows to be a faithful widow for the rest of her life.\n* **Miaoyu** (妙玉; *Miàoyù*; *Miao-yu*; 'Wonderful/Clever Jade'; Hawkes/Minford translation: Adamantina)   \n A young nun from Buddhist cloisters of the Rong-guo house. Although beautiful and learned, she is aloof, haughty, unsociable, and has an obsession with cleanliness. The novel says she was compelled by her illness to become a nun, and shelters herself under the nunnery to dodge political affairs. Her fate is not known after her abduction by bandits.\n* **Jia Yingchun** (賈迎春; 贾迎春; *Jiǎ Yíngchūn*; *Chia Ying-chun*; 'Welcoming Spring')   \nSecond female family member of the generation of the Jia household after Yuanchun, Yingchun is the daughter of Jia She, Baoyu's uncle and therefore his elder first cousin. A kind-hearted, weak-willed person, Yingchun is said to have a \"wooden\" personality and seems rather apathetic toward all worldly affairs. Although very pretty and well-read, she does not compare in intelligence and wit to any of her cousins. Yingchun's most famous trait, it seems, is her unwillingness to meddle in the affairs of her family. Eventually Yingchun marries an official of the imperial court, her marriage being merely one of her father's desperate attempts to raise the declining fortunes of the Jia family. The newly married Yingchun becomes a victim of domestic abuse and constant violence at the hands of her cruel, abusive husband.\n* **Jia Xichun** (賈惜春; 贾惜春; *Jiǎ Xīchūn*; *Chia Hsi-chun*; 'Treasuring Spring')   \nBaoyu's younger cousin from the Ningguo House, but brought up in the Rongguo House. A gifted painter, she is also a devout Buddhist. She is the young sister of Jia Zhen, head of the Ningguo House. At the end of the novel, after the fall of the house of Jia, she gives up her worldly concerns and becomes a Buddhist nun. She is the second youngest of Jinling's Twelve Beauties, described as a pre-teen in most parts of the novel.\n* **Wang Xifeng** (王熙鳳; 王熙凤; *Wáng Xīfèng*; *Wang Hsi-feng*; 'Splendid Phoenix'), alias *Sister Feng*.   \nBaoyu's elder cousin-in-law, young wife to Jia Lian (who is Baoyu's paternal first cousin), niece to Lady Wang. Xifeng is hence related to Baoyu both by blood and marriage. A handsome woman, Xifeng is capable, clever, humorous, and, at times, vicious and cruel. Undeniably the most worldly woman in the novel, Xifeng is in charge of the daily running of the Rongguo household and wields economic as well as political power within the family. Xifeng keeps both Lady Wang and Grandmother Jia entertained with her jokes and chatter. By playing the role of the perfect filial daughter-in-law, she rules the household with an iron fist. Xifeng can be kind-hearted toward the poor and helpless or cruel enough to kill. She makes a fortune by investing in loan sharking rather than maintaining the family estate and brings about the downfall of the family. She dies soon after the family assets are seized by the government.\n* **Jia Qiaojie** (賈巧姐; 贾巧姐; *Jiǎ Qiǎojiě*; *Chia Chiao-chieh*)   \nWang Xifeng's and Jia Lian's daughter. She is a child through much of the novel. After the fall of the house of Jia, in the version of Gao E and Cheng Weiyuan, she marries the son of a wealthy rural family introduced by Granny Liu and goes on to lead a happy, uneventful life in the countryside.\n* **Li Wan** (李紈; 李纨; *Lǐ Wán*; *Li Wan*; 'White Silk')   \nBaoyu's elder sister-in-law, widow of Baoyu's deceased elder brother, Jia Zhu (賈珠). Her primary task is to bring up her son Lan and watch over her female cousins. The novel portrays Li Wan, a young widow in her late twenties, as a mild-mannered woman with no wants or desires, the perfect Confucian ideal of a proper mourning widow. She eventually attains high social status due to the success of her son at the Imperial Exams, but the novel sees her as a tragic figure because she wasted her youth upholding the strict standards of behavior.\n* **Qin Keqing** (秦可卿; *Qín Kěqīng*; *Ch'in K'o-ching*;a homophone with \"look down upon love\")   \nDaughter-in-law to Jia Zhen. Of all the characters in the novel, the circumstances of her life and early death are amongst the most mysterious. Apparently a very beautiful and flirtatious woman, she carried on an affair with her father-in-law and dies before the second quarter of the novel. Her bedroom is bedecked with priceless artifacts belonging to extremely sensual women, both historical and mythological. In her bed, Bao Yu first travels to the Land of Illusion where he has a sexual encounter with Two-In-One, who represents Xue Baochai and Lin Daiyu. Two-in-One's name is also Keqing, making Qin Keqing also a significant character in Bao Yu's sexual experience. The original twelve songs hint that Qin Keqing hanged herself.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n***The Twelve Beauties of Jinling***\n\nPortraits of the main female characters of the novel *Dream of the Red Chamber*, as they are known as the *Twelve Beauties of Jinling*, by an anonymous artist of the Qing dynasty, collection of the Posner Center of Carnegie Mellon University.\n\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n\n\n### Other main characters[edit]\n\n\n* **Grandmother Jia** (賈母; 贾母; *Jiǎmǔ*), née Shi.   \nAlso called the Matriarch or the Dowager, the daughter of Marquis Shi of Jinling. Grandmother to both Baoyu and Daiyu, she is the highest living authority in the Rongguo house and the oldest and most respected of the entire clan, yet also a doting person. She has two sons, Jia She and Jia Zheng, and a daughter, Min, Daiyu's mother. Daiyu is brought to the house of the Jias at the insistence of Grandmother Jia, and she helps Daiyu and Baoyu bond as childhood playmates and, later, kindred spirits. She distributes her savings among her relatives after the seizure of their properties by the government shortly before her death.\n* **Jia She** (賈赦; 贾赦; *Jiǎ Shè*; *Chia Sheh*)   \nThe elder son of the Dowager. He is the father of Jia Lian and Jia Yingchun. He is a treacherous and greedy man, and a womanizer. He is jealous of his younger brother whom his mother favors. He is later stripped of his title and banished by the government.\n* **Jia Zheng** (賈政; 贾政; *Jiǎ Zhèng*; *Chia Cheng*)   \nBaoyu's father, the younger son of the Dowager. He is a disciplinarian and Confucian scholar. Afraid his one surviving heir will turn bad, he imposes strict rules on his son, and uses occasional corporal punishment. He has a wife, Lady Wang, and one concubine: Zhao. He is a Confucian scholar who tries to live life as an upright and decent person, but out of touch with reality and a hands-off person at home and in court.\n* **Jia Lian** (賈璉; 贾琏; *Jiǎ Liǎn*; *Chia Lien*)   \nXifeng's husband and Baoyu's paternal elder cousin, a notorious womanizer whose numerous affairs cause much trouble with his jealous wife, including affairs with men that are not known by his wife. His pregnant concubine (Second Sister You) eventually dies by his wife's engineering. He and his wife are in charge of most hiring and monetary allocation decisions, and often fight over this power. He is a cad with a flawed character but still has a conscience.\n* **Xiangling** (香菱; *Xiāng Líng*; 'Fragrant Water caltrop'; Hawkes/Minford translation: Caltrop) – the Xues' maid, born Zhen Yinglian (甄英蓮, a homophone with \"deserving pity\"), the kidnapped and lost daughter of Zhen Shiyin (甄士隱, a homophone with \"Hiding the truth\"), the country gentleman in Chapter 1. Her name is changed to Qiuling (秋菱) by Xue Pan's spoiled wife, Xia Jingui (夏金桂) who is jealous of her and tries to poison her. Xue Pan makes her the lady of the house after Jingui's death. She soon dies while giving birth.\n* **Ping'er** (平兒; 'Peace'; Hawkes/Minford translation: Patience)   \nXifeng's chief maid and personal confidante; also concubine to Xifeng's husband, Jia Lian. Originally Xifeng's maid in the Wang household, she follows Xifeng as part of her dowry when Xifeng marries into the Jia household. She handles her troubles with grace, assists Xifeng capably and appears to have the respect of most of the household servants. She is also one of the very few people who can get close to Xifeng. She wields considerable power in the house as Xifeng's most trusted assistant, but uses her power sparingly and justly. She is supremely loyal to her mistress, but more soft-hearted and sweet-tempered.\n* **Xue Pan** (薛蟠; *Xuē Pán*; *Hsueh Pan*; 'to Coil (as a dragon)')   \nBaochai's older brother, a dissolute, idle rake who was a local bully in Jinling. He was known for his amorous exploits with both men and women. Not particularly well educated, he once killed a man over a servant-girl (Xiangling) and had the manslaughter case hushed up with money.\n* **Granny Liu** (劉姥姥; 刘姥姥; *Liú Lǎolao*)   \nA country rustic and distant relation to the Wang family, who provides a comic contrast to the ladies of the Rongguo House during two visits. She eventually rescues Qiaojie from her maternal uncle, who wanted to sell her.\n* **Lady Wang** (王夫人; *Wáng Fūren*)   \nA Buddhist, primary wife of Jia Zheng. Daughter of one of the four most prominent families of Jinling. Because of her purported ill-health, she hands over the running of the household to her niece, Xifeng, as soon as the latter marries into the Jia household, although she retains overall control over Xifeng's affairs so that the latter always has to report to her. Although Lady Wang appears to be a kind mistress and a doting mother, she can in fact be cruel and ruthless when her authority is challenged. She pays a great deal of attention to Baoyu's maids to make sure that Baoyu does not develop romantic relationships with them.\n* **Aunt Xue** (薛姨媽; 薛姨妈; *Xuē Yímā*), née Wang   \nBaoyu's maternal aunt, mother to Pan and Baochai, sister to Lady Wang. She is kindly and affable for the most part, but finds it hard to control her unruly son.\n* **Hua Xiren** (花襲人; 花袭人; *Huā Xírén*; 'Flower Assails Men'; Hawkes/Minford translation: Aroma)   \nBaoyu's principal maid and his unofficial concubine. While she still has standing as the Dowager's maid, the Dowager gave her to Baoyu so, in practice, Xiren is his maid. Considerate and forever worried about Baoyu, she is the partner of his first adolescent sexual encounter in the real world in Chapter 5. After Baoyu's disappearance, she unknowingly marries actor Jiang Yuhan, one of Baoyu's friends.\n\n\n![](image)Qingwen, painted by Xu Baozhuan\n* **Qingwen** (晴雯; *Qíngwén*; 'Sunny Multicolored Clouds'; Hawkes/Minford translation: Skybright)   \nBaoyu's personal maid. Brash, haughty and the most beautiful maid in the household, Qingwen is said to resemble Daiyu very strongly. Of all of Baoyu's maids, she is the only one who dares to argue with Baoyu when reprimanded, but is also extremely devoted to him. She is disdainful of Xiren's attempt to use her sexual relation with Baoyu to raise her status in the family. Lady Wang later suspected her of having an affair with Baoyu and publicly dismisses her on that account; angry at the unfair treatment and of the indignities and slanders that attended her as a result, Qingwen dies of an illness shortly after leaving the Jia household.\n* **Yuanyang** (鴛鴦; 鸳鸯; *Yuānyang*; 'Pair of Mandarin Ducks'; Hawkes/Minford translation: Faithful)   \nThe Dowager's chief maid. She rejects a marriage proposal (as concubine) to the lecherous Jia She, Grandmother Jia's eldest son and commits suicide right after the Dowager's death.\n* **Mingyan** (茗煙; 茗烟; *Míngyān*; 'Tea Vapor'; Hawkes/Minford translation: Tealeaf)   \nBaoyu's page boy. Knows his master like the back of his hand.\n* **Zijuan** (紫鵑; 紫鹃; *Zǐjuān*; *Tzu-chuan*; 'Purple Rhododendron or Cuckoo'; Hawkes/Minford translation: Nightingale)   \nDaiyu's faithful maid, ceded by the Dowager to her granddaughter. She later becomes a nun to serve Jia Xichun.\n* **Xueyan** (雪雁; *Xuěyàn*; Hawkes/Minford translation: Snowgoose)   \nDaiyu's other maid. She came with Daiyu from Yangzhou, and comes across as a young, sweet girl. She is asked to accompany the veiled bride Baochai to trick Baoyu into believing that he is marrying Daiyu.\n* **Concubine Zhao** (趙姨娘; 赵姨娘; *Zhào Yíniáng*)   \nA concubine of Jia Zheng. She is the mother of Jia Tanchun and Jia Huan, Baoyu's half-siblings. She longs to be the mother of the head of the household, which she does not achieve. She plots to murder Baoyu and Xifeng with black magic, and it is believed that her plot cost her own life.\n\n\n### Notable minor characters[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A scene from the story, painted by Xu Baozhuan\n* **Qin Zhong** (秦鐘, a homophone with \"great lover\") – His elder sister is Qin Keqing, Baoyu's nephew's wife, and so he is technically a generation younger than Baoyu. Both he and Qin Keqing are the adopted children of **Qin Ye**(秦業). The two boys enroll in the Jia clan's school together and he becomes Baoyu's best friend. The novel leaves open the possibility that things might have gone beyond innocent friendship. Qin Zhong and the novice **Zhineng** (智能, \"Intelligent\"; \"Sapientia\" in the Hawkes translation) fall in love but Qin Zhong dies soon after from a combination of his father's severe beating, sexual exhaustion, grief and remorse.[23] One commentator writes that Qin Zhong is a pun for *qingzhong* (passion incarnate), and that his sister **Qinshi** initiates Baoyu into heterosexual relations in his dream and Qin Zhong initiates him into homosexual ones.[24]\n* **Jia Lan** (賈蘭) – Son of Baoyu's deceased older brother Jia Zhu and his virtuous wife Li Wan. Jia Lan is an appealing child throughout the book and at the end succeeds in the imperial examinations to the credit of the family.\n* **Jia Zhen** (賈珍) – Head of the Ningguo House, the elder branch of the Jia family. He has a wife, Lady You, a younger sister, Jia Xichun, and many concubines. He is extremely greedy and the unofficial head of the clan, since his father has retired. He has an adulterous affair with his daughter-in-law, Qin Keqing.\n* **Lady You** (尤氏) – Wife of Jia Zhen. She is the sole mistress of the Ningguo House.\n* **Jia Rong** (賈蓉) – Jia Zhen's son. He is the husband of Qin Keqing. An exact copy of his father, he is the Cavalier of the Imperial Guards.\n* **Second Sister You** (尤二姐) – Jia Lian takes her in secret as his lover. Though a kept woman before she was married, after her wedding she becomes a faithful and doting wife. Because of Wang Xifeng's intrigue, she finally kills herself by swallowing a large piece of gold.\n* **Lady Xing** (邢夫人) – Jia She's wife. She is Jia Lian's stepmother.\n* **Jia Huan** (賈環) – Son of Concubine Zhao. He and his mother are both reviled by the family, and he carries himself like a kicked dog. He shows his malignant nature by spilling candle wax, intending to blind his half-brother Baoyu.\n* **Sheyue** (麝月; Hawkes/Minford translation: Musk) — Baoyu's main maid after Xiren and Qingwen. She is beautiful and caring, a perfect complement to Xiren.\n* **Qiutong** (秋桐) — Jia Lian's other concubine. Originally a maid of Jia She, she is given to Jia Lian as a concubine. She is a very proud and arrogant woman.\n* **Sister Sha** (傻大姐) – A maid who does rough work for the Dowager. She is guileless but amusing and caring. In the Gao E and Cheng Weiyuan version, she unintentionally informs Daiyu of Baoyu's secret marriage plans.\n\n\n## Themes[edit]\n\n\n\n> *Honglou meng* is a book about enlightenment [or awakening]. ... A man in his life experiences several decades of winter and summer. The most sagacious and wise is certainly not submerged in considerations of loss and gain. However, the experiences of prosperity and decline, coming together and dispersing [of family members and friends] are too common; how can his mind be like wood and stone, without being moved by all this? In the beginning there is a profusion of intimate feelings, which is followed by tears and lamentations. Finally, there is a time when one feels that everything he does is futile. At this moment, how can he not be enlightened?\n> \n> — A commentary on the novel by writer Jiang Shunyi, dated 1869[25]\n> \n\n\nThe opening chapter of the novel describes a great stone archway and on either side a couplet is inscribed:\n\n\n\n\n> 假作真時真亦假，  \n> \n> 無為有處有還無。  \n> \n>   \n> \n> Truth becomes fiction when the fiction's true;  \n> \n> Real becomes not-real where the unreal's real.\n> — *The Story of the Stone*\n> \n\n\nThis couplet is later reiterated, however this time as:\n\n\n\n\n> 假去真來真勝假，  \n> \n> 無原有是有非無。  \n> \n>   \n> \n> When Fiction departs and Truth appears, Truth prevails;   \n> \n> Though Not-real was once Real, the Real is never unreal.\n> — *The Story of the Stone*[26]\n> \n\n\nAs one critic points out, the couplet signifies \"not a hard and fast division between truth and falsity, reality and illusion, but the impossibility of making such distinctions in any world, fictional or actual.\"[27] This theme is further reflected in the name of the main family, Jia (賈, pronounced jiǎ), which is a homophone with the character jiǎ 假, meaning false or fictitious; this is mirrored the surname of the other main family, Zhen (甄, pronounced zhēn), a homophone for the word \"real\" (真). It is suggested that the novel is both a realistic reflection and a fictional or \"dream\" version of Cao's own family.\n\n\nEarly Chinese critics identified its two major themes as those of the nature of love, and of the transitoriness of earthly material values, as outlined in Buddhist and Taoist philosophies.[28] \nLater scholars echoed the philosophical aspects of love and its transcendent power as depicted in the novel.[29] One remarked that the novel is a remarkable example of the \"dialectic of dream and reality, art and life, passion and enlightenment, nostalgia and knowledge.\"[30]\n\n\nThe novel also vividly depicts Chinese material culture, such as medicine, cuisine, tea culture, festivities, proverbs, mythology, Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, filial piety, opera, music, architecture, funeral rites, painting, classic literature and the Four Books. Among these, the novel is particularly notable for its grand use of poetry.[31]\n\n\nSince the establishment of Cao Xueqin as the novel's author, its autobiographical aspects have come to the fore. Cao Xueqin's clan was similarly raided in real life, and suffered a steep decline. Marxist interpretation starting in the New Culture Movement saw the novel as exposing feudal society's corruption and emphasized the clashes between the classes. Since the 1980s, critics have embraced the novel's richness and aesthetics in a more multicultural context.[32]\n\n\nIn the title *Hóng lóu Mèng* (紅樓夢, literally \"Red Chamber Dream\"), \"red chamber\" can refer to the sheltered chambers where the daughters of a prominent family reside.[33] It also refers to Baoyu's dream in chapter five, set in a \"red chamber\", a dream where the fates of many of the characters are foreshadowed. \"Mansion\" is one of the definitions of the Chinese character \"樓\" (lóu), but the scholar Zhou Ruchang writes that in the phrase *hónglóu* it is more accurately translated as \"chamber\".[34]\n\n\n\n## Reception and influences in modern era[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The cover of a 1912 printed edition of the Youzheng version\nIn the late 19th century, *Hong Lou Meng*'s influence was so pervasive that the reformer Liang Qichao attacked it along with another classic novel *Water Margin* as \"incitement to robbery and lust\", and for smothering the introduction of Western style novels, which he regarded as more socially responsible.[35] The eminent scholar Wang Guowei, however, achieved a new method of literary interpretation in an innovative and path-breaking 1904 essay which invoked the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer. Wang called the novel \"the tragedy of tragedies\", in contrast to the prosperous endings in most earlier drama and fiction.[36] Wang further proclaims the novel as \"[W]orthy of being considered as the one great masterpiece in the realm of Chinese art.\"[37]\n\n\nIn the early 20th century, although the New Culture Movement took a critical view of the Confucian classics, the scholar Hu Shih used the tools of textual criticism to put the novel in an entirely different light, as a foundation for national culture. Hu and his students, Gu Jiegang and Yu Pingbo, first established that Cao Xueqin was the work's author. Taking the question of authorship seriously reflected a new respect for fiction, since the lesser forms of literature had not been traditionally ascribed to particular individuals.[38] Hu next built on Cai Yuanpei's investigations of the printing history of the early editions to prepare reliable reading texts. The final, and in some respects most important task, was to study the vocabulary and usage of Cao's Beijing dialect as a basis for Modern Mandarin.\n\n\nIn the 1920s, scholars and devoted readers developed *Hongxue*, or Redology into both a scholarly field and a popular avocation. Among the avid readers was the young Mao Zedong, who later claimed to have read the novel five times and praised it as one of China's greatest works of literature.[39] The influence of the novel's themes and style are evident in many modern Chinese prose works. The early 1950s was a rich period for Redology with publication of major studies by Yu Pingbo. Zhou Ruchang, who as a young scholar had come to the attention of Hu Shih in the late 1940s, published his first study in 1953, which became a best seller.[40] But in 1954 Mao personally criticized Yu Pingbo for his \"bourgeois idealism\" in failing to emphasize that the novel exposed the decadence of \"feudal\" society and the theme of class struggle. In the Hundred Flowers Campaign, Yu came under heavy criticism but the attacks were so extensive and full of quotations from his work that they spread Yu's ideas to many people who would not otherwise have known of their existence.[41]\n\n\nDuring the Cultural Revolution, the novel initially came under fire, though it quickly regained its prestige in the following years. Zhou Ruchang resumed his lifework, eventually publishing more than sixty biographical and critical studies.[40] In 2006, Zhou, who had long distrusted Gao E's editions, and the novelist Liu Xinwu, author of popular studies of the novel, joined to produce a new 80 chapter version which Zhou had edited to eliminate the Cheng-Gao emendations. Liu completed an ending that was supposedly more true to Cao's original intent.[42] The novel continues to be influential on contemporary Chinese poets such as Middle Generation's An Qi, who paid homage to it in her poem *To Cao Xueqin*.[43]\n\n\n\n## Translations and reception in the West[edit]\n\n\n\n> ... one of the great monuments of the world's literature ...\n> \n> — Review of the *Dream of the Red Chamber* by Anthony West, *The New Yorker*[44]\n> \n\n\nCao utilizes many levels of colloquial and literary language and incorporates forms of classic poetry that are integral to the novel, making it a major challenge to translate.[45] A 2014 study of fourteen translations of the novel concluded that the work is a \"challenge even to the most resourceful of translators, and the process of rendering it into another language is bound to involve more translation problems, techniques, and principles than the process of rendering any other literary work.\" Accordingly, the aims and achievements of the translators differ widely.[46]\n\n\nThe first recorded translation into English was in 1812 by the Protestant missionary and sinologist Robert Morrison (1782–1834), who translated part of chapter four for the second volume of his unpublished 1812 book *Horae Sinicae*. In 1816, Morrison did publish a translation of a conversation from chapter 31 in his Chinese language textbook *Dialogues and Detached Sentences in the Chinese Language*. In 1819, the British diplomat and sinologist John Francis Davis (1795–1890) published a short excerpt in the *London Journal Quarterly Review*. Davis also published a poem from chapter 3 in the 1830 *Transactions* of the Royal Asiatic Society.[47] In 1842, Karl Gützlaff's article, \"Hung Lau Mung, or Dreams in the Red Chamber\", in the sixth volume of the \"Chinese Repository\", included translation and criticism of some passages.\n\n\nA literal translation of selected passages was published for foreigners learning Chinese by the Presbyterian Mission Press of Ningbo in 1846.[48] Edward Charles Bowra of the Chinese Imperial Maritime Customs published a translation of the first eight chapters in 1868[49] and H. Bencraft Joly of the first fifty-six chapters in 1892.[50] The Reverend E.J. Eitel reviewed Joly's translation and condemned the novel, saying that Chinese read it \"because of its wickedness.\" Herbert Giles, whom John Minford called \"one of the more free-thinking British consular officers,\" took a more favorable view in a twenty-five page synopsis in 1885 that Minford calls still a \"useful guide.\"[51] \nGiles further highlighted it in his *A History of Chinese Literature* in 1901.[52]\n\n\nIn 1928, Elfrida Hudson published a short introduction to the novel titled \"An old, old story\".[53] An abridged translation by Wang Chi-Chen which emphasized the central love story was published in 1929, with a preface by Arthur Waley. Waley said that \"we feel most clearly the symbolic or universal value\" of the characters in the passages which recount dreams. \"Pao Yu\", Waley continued, stands for \"imagination and poetry\" and his father for \"all those sordid powers of pedantry and restriction which hamper the artist\".[54] In a 1930 review of Wang's translation, Harry Clemons of *The Virginia Quarterly Review* wrote \"This is a great novel\", and along with the *Romance of the Three Kingdoms*, it \"ranks foremost\" among the novels of classic Chinese literature.[55] Although Clemons felt \"meaning was only fragmentarily revealed\" in the English translated prose and that \"many of the incidents\" and \"much of the poetry\" were omitted, he nevertheless thought \"at any rate the effort to read *The Dream of the Red Chamber* is eminently worth making.\"[55] In 1958 Wang published an expansion on his earlier abridgement, though it was still truncated at 60 chapters. \n\n\nThe stream of translations and literary studies in the West grew steadily, building on Chinese language scholarship. The 1932 German translation by Franz Kuhn[56] was the basis of an abridged version, *The Dream of the Red Chamber*, by Florence and Isabel McHugh published in 1958,[57] and a later French version. Critic Anthony West wrote in *The New Yorker* in 1958 that the novel is to the Chinese \"very much what *The Brothers Karamazov* is to Russian and *Remembrance of Things Past* is to French literature\" and \"it is beyond question one of the great novels of all literature.\"[44] Kenneth Rexroth in a 1958 review of the McHugh translation, describes the novel as among the \"greatest works of prose fiction in all the history of literature\", for it is \"profoundly humane\".[58] Bramwell Seaton Bonsall finished what is probably the first complete 120 chapter translation in the 1950s, *Red Chamber Dream*, but publication was abandoned when Penguin announced the Hawkes project. A typescript is available on the web.[59]\n\n\nThe respected and prolific Yang Hsien-yi was commissioned to translate the first complete English version. Though he confessed that this was his least favorite of the classic novels, Yang began work in 1961 and had finished roughly 100 chapters in 1964, when he was ordered to stop. He and his wife, Gladys Yang, were imprisoned on suspicion of espionage during the Cultural Revolution, but they finished the translation as a team after their release in 1974. It was published by Beijing Foreign Language Press as *A Dream of Red Mansions*, in three volumes, 1978–1980.[60] The second complete English translation to be published was by David Hawkes some century and a half after the first English translation. Hawkes was already a recognised redologist and had previously translated *Chu Ci* when Penguin Classics approached him in 1970 to make a translation which could appeal to English readers. After resigning from his professorial position, Hawkes published the first eighty chapters in three volumes (1973, 1977, 1980).[61] *The Story of the Stone* (1973–1980), the first eighty chapters translated by Hawkes and last forty by his son-in-law John Minford consists of five volumes and 2,339 pages of actual core text (not including Prefaces, Introductions and Appendices) and over 2,800 pages in total.[62] The word count of the Penguin Classics English translation is estimated at 845,000 words. In a 1980 review of the Hawkes and Minford translation in *The New York Review of Books*, Frederic Wakeman, Jr. described the novel as a \"masterpiece\" and the work of a \"literary genius\".[63] Cynthia L. Chennault of the University of Florida stated that \"The *Dream* is acclaimed as one of the most psychologically penetrating novels of world literature.\"[64] The novel and its author have been described as among the most significant works of literature and literary figures of the past millennium.[65][66]\n\n\nThe sinologist Oldřich Král also undertook a Czech translation of the entire novel, *Sen v červeném domě* (Prague: Odeon, three volumes, 1986–1988). Slovak sinologist and philosopher Marina Čarnogurská translated into Slovak whole four volumes of the novel, *Sen o Červenom pavilóne* (Bratislava: Petrus, 2001–2003. ISBN 80-88939-25-9).\n\n\nIn 2014, an abridged English translation of *Dream* by writer Lin Yutang resurfaced in a Japanese library. Lin's translation, about half the length of the original, is reportedly not a literal one.[67]\n\n\nIn a study of fourteen translations into English, German, French, Spanish, Laurence K.P. Wong finds that some challenges to translation are \"surmountable\", some \"insurmountable,\" though translators sometimes hit on \"surprisingly happy versions that come very close to the original,\" Hawkes, however, normally came up with versions that are \"accurate, ingenious, and delightful....\" Hawkes recreates the meanings and sounds of the original with \"remarkable precision, achieving much greater success than any one of his fellow translators in surmounting the limits of literary translation....\"[68] Another scholar agreed that the Yang's translation is \"literal\" in the sense of rendering word for word, but argued that the Hawkes translation achieved what should be called a \"higher level of literalness: in the sense of \"text for text.\" That is, Hawkes tries to maintain the range and contrasting levels of usage of the original while the Yangs smooth out the language with a \"plain international English\" and add explanations in footnotes.[69]\n\n\nOther scholars examined particular aspects of the Yangs' translation and the Hawkes and Minford translation. The names of some characters sound like the words for their personality traits, and some names serve as allusions. Hawkes conveys the communicative function of the names rather than lexical equivalence; for example, Huo Qi is homonymous with \"the beginning of catastrophe\", and Hawkes makes the English name \"Calamity\". Hawkes sometimes uses Italian/Sanskrit terms when Western Christian culture lacks a term for a concept.[70] Gladys Yang and Yang Hsien-yi prefer literal translation, informing readers of names' meanings through annotations. Zhu Jian-chun argued that Hawkes’ choice to simply translate certain names that are puns makes the author's intentions clearer, and that the Yangs' choice of transliteration leaves the meaning more elusive, even if the transliterated names are more believable as character names. Zhu questioned the Yangs' translation of \"Dao Ren\" as \"reverend\".[70] According to Barry Lee Reynolds and Chao-Chih Liao, the Yangs' version contains more faithful translations of religious expressions but is also less readable to English language readers.[71] Xuxiang Suo argued, “Hawkes successfully conveyed the original textual information to foreign readers with smooth and beautiful English, but the loss of Chinese culture-loaded information is inevitable. Mr. Yang mostly adopted the way of literal translation, trying his best to keep the true and idiomatic Chinese style and national tint.\"[72]\n\n\n\n## Sequels and continuations[edit]\n\n\nOwing to its immense popularity, numerous sequels and continuations to the novel have been published, even during the Qing era. There are currently more than thirty recorded sequels or continuations to the novel, including modern ones.[73] Modern (post-1949) continuations tend to follow after the eightieth chapter, and include those by Zhang Zhi,[74] Zhou Yuqing,[75] Hu Nan[76] and Liu Xinwu.[77]\n\n\n\n## Adaptations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A scene from *Dream of the Red Chamber* as depicted in Chinese opera\nAt least fourteen cinematic adaptations of the *Dream of the Red Chamber* have been made, including the 1944 film directed by Bu Wancang, the Hong Kong Shaw Brothers adaptation starring Sylvia Chang and Brigitte Lin, and the 1988 film directed by Xie Tieli (谢铁骊) and Zhao Yuan (赵元). This last film took two years to prepare and three years to shoot, and remains, at 735 minutes, the longest Chinese film ever made.[78]\n\n\nIn 1981, Jiangsu Song and Dance Ensemble premiered a dance drama version of *Dream of the Red Chamber*. A reworked version was performed in 1982 in Beijing by China Opera and Dance Drama Theatre featuring lead dancer Chen Ailian.[79]\n\n\nAt least ten television adaptations have been produced (excluding numerous Chinese opera adaptations), and they include the renowned 1987 television series, which is regarded by many within China as being a near-definitive adaptation of the novel. It was initially somewhat controversial as few Redologists believed a TV adaptation could do the novel full justice. Producer and director Wang Fulin's decision in employing non-professional young actors was vindicated as the TV series gained enormous popularity in China. The series' success owes much to composer Wang Liping (王立平). He set many of the novel's classical verses to music, taking as long as four years to deliberate and complete his compositions. Other television versions include a 1996 Taiwanese series and a 2010 version directed by Fifth Generation director Li Shaohong.\n\n\nUnlike the other great Chinese novels, particularly *Romance of the Three Kingdoms* and *Journey to the West*, the *Dream of the Red Chamber* has received little attention in the gaming world, with only two Chinese language visual novels having been released as of 2017. *Hong Lou Meng* and *Hong Lou Meng: Lin Daiyu yu Bei Jingwang* (红楼梦：林黛玉与北静王) were both released by Beijing Entertainment All Technology (北京娱乐通). The latter one was released on 8 January 2010, and it is an extended version of the first game, with the main heroines of the game fully voiced and additional CG+endings.\n\n\nAn English-language opera based on the novel in two acts was composed by Chinese American composer Bright Sheng, with libretto by Sheng and David Henry Hwang. The three-hour opera had its world premiere on 10 September 2016, by the San Francisco Opera. For their 2020 album, *Transience of Life*, the American art-rock band Elysian Fields set several poems from the novel to music.\n\n\nIn the 2023 video game *Limbus Company* created by South Korean studio Project Moon, character Hong Lu is based off of *Dream of the Red Chamber*. He is one of the 12 playable sinners in the game, and wields a guandao.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image) Novels portal\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"CliffsNotes, About the Novel: Introduction\".

In chapter 1, after a second perusal of the book, Voiding-the-Void Daoist (supposedly its first reader) concludes that \"its main theme is about love.\" \"Love\" is perhaps an inadequate rendering of *qing*, whose range of associations includes desire, affection, feelings, emotions, sentiments, sentience. It is also linked to subjective consciousness, imagination, aesthetic sensibility. Cao Xueqin idealizes *qing* and raises its transcendent dimension to an almost metaphysical level; in doing so he also emphasizes lyrical self-containment, the power of the mind to dream and imagine a world, and the conception of the romantic-aesthetic as an alternate sphere of existence.

One of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature, it is known for its psychological scope, and its observation of the worldview, aesthetics, lifestyles, and social relations of 18th-century China.[1]\n\n\nThe intricate strands of its plot depict the rise and decline of a family much like Cao's own and, by extension, of the dynasty itself. Cao depicts the power of the father over the family, but the novel is intended to be a memorial to the women he knew in his youth: friends, relatives and servants. At a more profound level, the author explores religious and philosophical questions, and the writing style includes echoes of the plays and novels of the late Ming, as well as poetry from earlier periods.[2]\n\n\nCao apparently began composing it in the 1740s and worked on it until his death in 1763 or 1764. Copies of his uncompleted manuscript circulated in Cao's social circle, under the title *Story of a Stone*, in slightly varying versions of eighty chapters. It was not published until nearly three decades after Cao's death, when Gao E and Cheng Weiyuan (程偉元), edited the first and second printed editions under the title *Dream of the Red Chamber* in 1791–92, adding 40 chapters. It is still debated whether Gao and Cheng composed these chapters themselves and the extent to which they did or did not represent Cao's intentions. Their 120-chapter edition became the most widely circulated version.[3] The title has also been translated as *Red Chamber Dream* and *A Dream of Red Mansions*. \"Redology\" is the field of study devoted to the novel.\n\n\n\n\n## Language[edit]\n\n\nThe novel is composed in written vernacular (*baihua*) rather than Classical Chinese (*wenyan*). Cao Xueqin was well versed in Chinese poetry and in Classical Chinese, having written tracts in the semi-*wenyan* style, while the novel's dialogue is written in the Beijing Mandarin dialect, which was to become the basis of modern spoken Chinese. In the early 20th century, lexicographers used the text to establish the vocabulary of the new standardised language and reformers used the novel to promote the written vernacular.[4]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Textual history[edit]\n\n\n*Dream of the Red Chamber* has a complicated textual history that scholars and historians have long debated.[5] It is known with certainty that Cao Xueqin began writing *Dream of the Red Chamber* in the 1740s.[5] Cao was a member of a prominent Chinese family that had served the Manchu emperors of the Qing dynasty but whose fortunes had begun to decline. By the time of Cao's death in 1763 or 1764, hand-copied manuscripts of the novel's first 80 chapters had begun circulating, and Cao may have made early drafts of the remaining chapters.[5]\nThese hand-copied manuscripts circulated first among his personal friends and a growing circle of aficionados, then eventually on the open market where they sold for large sums of money.[6][7]\n\n\nThe first printed version of *Dream of the Red Chamber*, published by Cheng Weiyuan and Gao E in 1791, contains edits and revisions that Cao never authorized.[3] It is possible that Cao destroyed the last chapters[8] or that at least parts of Cao's original ending were incorporated into the 120 chapter Cheng-Gao versions,[9] with Gao E's \"careful emendations\" of Cao's draft.[10]\n\n\n\n#### \"Rouge\" versions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A page from the \"Jimao manuscript\" (one of the Rouge versions) of the novel, 1759.[11]\nUp until 1791, the novel circulated in hand-copied manuscripts. Even amongst some 12 independent surviving manuscripts, small differences in some characters, rearrangements and possible rewritings cause the texts to vary a little. The earliest manuscripts end abruptly at the latest at the 80th chapter. The earlier versions contain comments and annotations in red or black ink from unknown commentators. These commentators' remarks reveal much about the author as a person, and it is now believed that some of them may even be members of Cao Xueqin's own family. The most prominent commentator is Zhiyanzhai, who revealed much of the interior structuring of the work and the original manuscript ending, now lost. These manuscripts, the most textually reliable versions, are known as \"rouge versions\" (*zhī běn* 脂本).\n\n\nThe early 80 chapters brim with prophecies and dramatic foreshadowings that give hints as to how the book would continue. For example, it is obvious that Lin Daiyu will eventually die in the course of the novel; that Baoyu and Baochai will marry; that Baoyu will become a monk. A branch of Redology, known as *tànyì xué* (探佚學), is focused on recovering the lost manuscript ending, based on the commentators' annotations in the Rouge versions, as well as the internal foreshadowings in the earlier 80 chapters.\n\n\nSeveral early manuscripts are still extant. At the present, the \"Jiaxu manuscript\" (dating to 1754) is held in the Shanghai Museum, the \"Jimao manuscript\" (1759) is held in the National Library of China, and the \"Gengchen manuscript\" (1760) is held in the library of Peking University. Beijing Normal University and the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences both also held manuscripts of the novel that predate the first printed edition of 1791.\n\n\n\n* ![The \"Jiaxu manuscript\", 1754](image)\n\nThe \"Jiaxu manuscript\", 1754\n* ![The \"Gengchen manuscript\", 1760](image)\n\nThe \"Gengchen manuscript\", 1760\n\n\n#### Cheng–Gao versions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cheng-Gao versions\n\nIn 1791, Gao E and Cheng Weiyuan brought out the novel's first printed edition. This was also the first \"complete\" edition of *The Story of the Stone*, which they printed as the *Illustrated Dream of the Red Chamber* (*Xiùxiàng Hóng Lóu Mèng* 繡像紅樓夢). While the original Rouge manuscripts have eighty chapters, the 1791 edition completed the novel in 120 chapters. The first 80 chapters were edited from the Rouge versions, but the last 40 were newly published.[12]\n\n\nIn 1792, Cheng and Gao published a second edition correcting editorial errors of the 1791 version. In the 1791 prefaces, Cheng claimed to have put together an ending based on the author's working manuscripts.[10]\n\n\nThe debate over the last 40 chapters and the 1791–92 prefaces continues to this day. Many modern scholars believe these chapters were a later addition. Hu Shih, in his *Studies on A Dream of the Red Chamber* (1921) argued that these chapters were written by Gao E, citing the foreshadowing of the main characters' fates in Chapter 5, which differs from the ending of the 1791 Cheng-Gao version. However, during the mid-20th century, the discovery of a 120 chapter manuscript that dates well before 1791 further complicated the questions regarding Gao E and Cheng Weiyuan's involvement—whether they simply edited or actually wrote the continuation of the novel.[13] Though it is unclear if the last 40 chapters of the discovered manuscript contained the original works of Cao, Irene Eber found the discovery \"seems to confirm Cheng and Gao's claim that they merely edited a complete manuscript, consisting of 120 chapters, rather than actually writing a portion of the novel\".[13]\n\n\nThe book is usually published and read in Cheng Weiyuan and Gao E's 120 chapter version. Some modern editions, such as Zhou Ruchang's, do not include the last 40 chapters.\n\n\nIn 2014, three researchers using data analysis of writing styles announced that \"Applying our method to the Cheng–Gao version of *Dream of the Red Chamber* has led to convincing if not irrefutable evidence that the first 80 chapters and the last 40 chapters of the book were written by two different authors.\"[14]\n\n\nIn 2020, Zhang Qingshan, the president of the academic organization Society of the Dream of the Red Chamber, stated that although the authorship of the novel's last 40 chapters remains uncertain, it is unlikely Gao E was the one who wrote them.[15]\n\n\n\n## Plot summary[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A piece from a series of brush paintings by the Qing dynasty artist Sun Wen (1818–1904), depicting a scene from the novel.\nIn the novel's frame story, a sentient Stone, left over when the goddess Nüwa mended the heaven aeons ago, wants to enjoy the pleasures of the \"red dust\" (the mundane world). The Stone begs a Taoist priest and a Buddhist monk to take it with them to see the world. The Stone, along with a companion (in Cheng-Gao versions they are merged into the same character), is then given a chance to learn from human existence, and enters the mortal realm, reborn as Jia Baoyu (\"Precious Jade\") – thus \"The Story of the Stone\".\n\n\nThe novel provides a detailed, episodic record of life in the two branches of the wealthy, aristocratic Jia (賈) clan—the Rongguo House (榮國府) and the Ningguo House (寧國府)—who reside in large, adjacent family compounds in the capital. The capital, however, is not named, and the first chapter insists that the dynasty is indeterminate.[16] The ancestors of the two families were made Chinese nobility and given imperial titles, and as the novel begins the two houses are among the most illustrious families in the city. One of the Jia daughters is made a Royal Consort, and to suitably receive her, the family constructs the Daguanyuan, a lush landscaped garden, the setting for much of subsequent action. The novel describes the Jias' wealth and influence in great naturalistic detail, and charts the Jias' fall from the height of their prestige, following some thirty main characters and over four hundred minor ones.\n\n\nAs the carefree adolescent male heir of the family, Baoyu in this life has a special bond with his sickly cousin Lin Daiyu, who shares his love of music and poetry. Baoyu, however, is predestined to marry another cousin, Xue Baochai, whose grace and intelligence exemplify an ideal woman, but with whom he lacks an emotional connection. The romantic rivalry and friendship among the three characters against the backdrop of the family's declining fortunes form the central story.\n\n\n\nA series of paintings by Fei Danxu (1801–1850) depicting scenes from the novel.\n\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n\n\n## Characters[edit]\n\n\n![](image)1889 woodcut print depicting Xue Baochai chasing butterflies (chapter 27).\n*Dream of the Red Chamber* contains an extraordinarily large number of characters: nearly 40 are considered major characters, and there are over 400 additional ones.[17] The novel is also known for the complex portraits of its many women characters.[18] According to Lu Xun in the appendix to *A Brief History of Chinese Fiction*, *Dream of the Red Chamber* broke every conceivable thought and technique in traditional Chinese fiction; its realistic characterization presents thoroughly human characters who are neither \"wholly good nor wholly bad\", but who seem to inhabit part of the real world.[19]\n\n\nThe names of the characters present a challenge to the translator, since many of them convey meaning. David Hawkes left the names of the masters, mistresses, and their family members in pinyin (Jia Zheng and Lady Wang, for instance); translated the meanings of the servants's names, (such as Aroma and Skybright); and put the names of the Daoists and Buddhists into Latin (Sapientia); and those of actors and actresses into French.[20]\n\n\n\n### Jia Baoyu and the Twelve Beauties of Jinling[edit]\n\n\n* **Jia Baoyu** (traditional Chinese: 賈寶玉; simplified Chinese: 贾宝玉; pinyin: *Jiǎ Bǎoyù*; Wade–Giles: *Chia Pao-yu*; lit. 'Precious Jade')   \nThe main protagonist is about 12 or 13 years old when introduced in the novel.[21] The adolescent son of Jia Zheng and his wife, Lady Wang, and born with a piece of luminescent jade in his mouth (the Stone), Baoyu is the heir apparent to the Rongguo House. Frowned on by his strict Confucian father, Baoyu reads *Zhuangzi* and *Romance of the Western Chamber* on the sly, rather than the Four Books of classic Chinese education. Baoyu is highly intelligent, but dislikes the fawning bureaucrats who frequent his father's house. A sensitive and compassionate individual, he has a special relationship with many of the women in the house.\n* **Lin Daiyu** (林黛玉; *Lín Dàiyù*; *Lin Tai-yu*; 'Blue-black Jade')   \nJia Baoyu's younger first cousin and his true love. She is the daughter of Lin Ruhai (林如海), an official in the lucrative Yangzhou salt commission, and Lady Jia Min (賈敏), Baoyu's paternal aunt. She is an icon of spirituality and intelligence: beautiful, sentimental, sarcastic, self-assured, an accomplished poet, but subject to fits of jealousy. She suffers from a respiratory ailment. In the frame story, Baoyu, in his previous incarnation as the Deity Shenying, watered Fairy Crimson Pearl, Daiyu's incarnation. The purpose of her mortal reincarnation is to repay Baoyu with tears. The novel proper starts in Chapter 3 with Daiyu's arrival at the Rongguo House shortly after the death of her mother.[22]\n* **Xue Baochai** (薛寶釵; 薛宝钗; *Xuē Bǎochāi*; *Hsueh Pao-chai*; 'Jeweled Hair Pin')   \nJia Baoyu's other first cousin. The only daughter of Aunt Xue (薛姨媽}), sister to Baoyu's mother, Baochai is a foil to Daiyu. Where Daiyu is unconventional and sincere, Baochai is worldly-wise and very tactful: a model Chinese feudal maiden. The novel describes her as beautiful and ambitious. Baochai has a round face, fair skin, large eyes, and, some would say, a more voluptuous figure in contrast to Daiyu's slender willowy daintiness. Baochai carries a golden locket with her which contains words given to her in childhood by a Buddhist monk. Baochai's golden locket and Baoyu's jade contain inscriptions that appear to complement one another perfectly in the material world. Her marriage to Baoyu is seen in the book as predestined, but ultimately fails due to Baoyu's love for Daiyu persisting after her death.\n* **Jia Yuanchun** (賈元春; 贾元春; *Jiǎ Yuánchūn*; *Chia Yuan-chun*; 'First Spring')   \nBaoyu's elder sister by about a decade. Originally one of the ladies-in-waiting in the imperial palace, Yuanchun later becomes an Imperial Consort, having impressed the Emperor with her virtue and learning. Her illustrious position as a favorite of the Emperor marks the height of the Jia family's powers. Despite her prestigious position, Yuanchun feels imprisoned within the imperial palace, and dies at the age of forty. The name of four sisters together \"Yuan-Ying-Tan-Xi\" is a homophone with \"Supposed to sigh\".\n* **Jia Tanchun** (賈探春; 贾探春; *Jiǎ Tànchūn*; *Chia Tan-chun*; 'Seeking Spring')   \nBaoyu's younger half-sister by Concubine Zhao. Extremely outspoken, she is almost as capable as Wang Xifeng. Wang Xifeng herself compliments her privately, but laments that she was \"born in the wrong womb\", since concubine children are not respected as much as those by first wives. She is also a very talented poet. Tanchun is nicknamed \"Rose\" for her beauty and her prickly personality. She later marries into a military family on the South Sea far away from home.\n* **Shi Xiangyun** (史湘雲; 史湘云; *Shǐ Xiāngyún*; *Shih Hsiang-yun*; 'Xiang River Clouds')   \n Jia Baoyu's younger second cousin. Grandmother Jia's grandniece. Orphaned in infancy, she grows up under her wealthy paternal uncle and aunt who treats her unkindly. In spite of this Xiangyun is openhearted and cheerful. A comparatively androgynous beauty, Xiangyun looks good in men's clothes (once she put on Baoyu's clothes and Grandmother Jia thought she was a man), and loves to drink. She is forthright and without tact, but her forgiving nature takes the sting from her casually truthful remarks. She is well educated and as talented a poet as Daiyu or Baochai. Her young husband dies shortly after their marriage. She vows to be a faithful widow for the rest of her life.\n* **Miaoyu** (妙玉; *Miàoyù*; *Miao-yu*; 'Wonderful/Clever Jade'; Hawkes/Minford translation: Adamantina)   \n A young nun from Buddhist cloisters of the Rong-guo house. Although beautiful and learned, she is aloof, haughty, unsociable, and has an obsession with cleanliness. The novel says she was compelled by her illness to become a nun, and shelters herself under the nunnery to dodge political affairs. Her fate is not known after her abduction by bandits.\n* **Jia Yingchun** (賈迎春; 贾迎春; *Jiǎ Yíngchūn*; *Chia Ying-chun*; 'Welcoming Spring')   \nSecond female family member of the generation of the Jia household after Yuanchun, Yingchun is the daughter of Jia She, Baoyu's uncle and therefore his elder first cousin. A kind-hearted, weak-willed person, Yingchun is said to have a \"wooden\" personality and seems rather apathetic toward all worldly affairs. Although very pretty and well-read, she does not compare in intelligence and wit to any of her cousins. Yingchun's most famous trait, it seems, is her unwillingness to meddle in the affairs of her family. Eventually Yingchun marries an official of the imperial court, her marriage being merely one of her father's desperate attempts to raise the declining fortunes of the Jia family. The newly married Yingchun becomes a victim of domestic abuse and constant violence at the hands of her cruel, abusive husband.\n* **Jia Xichun** (賈惜春; 贾惜春; *Jiǎ Xīchūn*; *Chia Hsi-chun*; 'Treasuring Spring')   \nBaoyu's younger cousin from the Ningguo House, but brought up in the Rongguo House. A gifted painter, she is also a devout Buddhist. She is the young sister of Jia Zhen, head of the Ningguo House. At the end of the novel, after the fall of the house of Jia, she gives up her worldly concerns and becomes a Buddhist nun. She is the second youngest of Jinling's Twelve Beauties, described as a pre-teen in most parts of the novel.\n* **Wang Xifeng** (王熙鳳; 王熙凤; *Wáng Xīfèng*; *Wang Hsi-feng*; 'Splendid Phoenix'), alias *Sister Feng*.   \nBaoyu's elder cousin-in-law, young wife to Jia Lian (who is Baoyu's paternal first cousin), niece to Lady Wang. Xifeng is hence related to Baoyu both by blood and marriage. A handsome woman, Xifeng is capable, clever, humorous, and, at times, vicious and cruel. Undeniably the most worldly woman in the novel, Xifeng is in charge of the daily running of the Rongguo household and wields economic as well as political power within the family. Xifeng keeps both Lady Wang and Grandmother Jia entertained with her jokes and chatter. By playing the role of the perfect filial daughter-in-law, she rules the household with an iron fist. Xifeng can be kind-hearted toward the poor and helpless or cruel enough to kill. She makes a fortune by investing in loan sharking rather than maintaining the family estate and brings about the downfall of the family. She dies soon after the family assets are seized by the government.\n* **Jia Qiaojie** (賈巧姐; 贾巧姐; *Jiǎ Qiǎojiě*; *Chia Chiao-chieh*)   \nWang Xifeng's and Jia Lian's daughter. She is a child through much of the novel. After the fall of the house of Jia, in the version of Gao E and Cheng Weiyuan, she marries the son of a wealthy rural family introduced by Granny Liu and goes on to lead a happy, uneventful life in the countryside.\n* **Li Wan** (李紈; 李纨; *Lǐ Wán*; *Li Wan*; 'White Silk')   \nBaoyu's elder sister-in-law, widow of Baoyu's deceased elder brother, Jia Zhu (賈珠). Her primary task is to bring up her son Lan and watch over her female cousins. The novel portrays Li Wan, a young widow in her late twenties, as a mild-mannered woman with no wants or desires, the perfect Confucian ideal of a proper mourning widow. She eventually attains high social status due to the success of her son at the Imperial Exams, but the novel sees her as a tragic figure because she wasted her youth upholding the strict standards of behavior.\n* **Qin Keqing** (秦可卿; *Qín Kěqīng*; *Ch'in K'o-ching*;a homophone with \"look down upon love\")   \nDaughter-in-law to Jia Zhen. Of all the characters in the novel, the circumstances of her life and early death are amongst the most mysterious. Apparently a very beautiful and flirtatious woman, she carried on an affair with her father-in-law and dies before the second quarter of the novel. Her bedroom is bedecked with priceless artifacts belonging to extremely sensual women, both historical and mythological. In her bed, Bao Yu first travels to the Land of Illusion where he has a sexual encounter with Two-In-One, who represents Xue Baochai and Lin Daiyu. Two-in-One's name is also Keqing, making Qin Keqing also a significant character in Bao Yu's sexual experience. The original twelve songs hint that Qin Keqing hanged herself.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n***The Twelve Beauties of Jinling***\n\nPortraits of the main female characters of the novel *Dream of the Red Chamber*, as they are known as the *Twelve Beauties of Jinling*, by an anonymous artist of the Qing dynasty, collection of the Posner Center of Carnegie Mellon University.\n\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n\n\n### Other main characters[edit]\n\n\n* **Grandmother Jia** (賈母; 贾母; *Jiǎmǔ*), née Shi.   \nAlso called the Matriarch or the Dowager, the daughter of Marquis Shi of Jinling. Grandmother to both Baoyu and Daiyu, she is the highest living authority in the Rongguo house and the oldest and most respected of the entire clan, yet also a doting person. She has two sons, Jia She and Jia Zheng, and a daughter, Min, Daiyu's mother. Daiyu is brought to the house of the Jias at the insistence of Grandmother Jia, and she helps Daiyu and Baoyu bond as childhood playmates and, later, kindred spirits. She distributes her savings among her relatives after the seizure of their properties by the government shortly before her death.\n* **Jia She** (賈赦; 贾赦; *Jiǎ Shè*; *Chia Sheh*)   \nThe elder son of the Dowager. He is the father of Jia Lian and Jia Yingchun. He is a treacherous and greedy man, and a womanizer. He is jealous of his younger brother whom his mother favors. He is later stripped of his title and banished by the government.\n* **Jia Zheng** (賈政; 贾政; *Jiǎ Zhèng*; *Chia Cheng*)   \nBaoyu's father, the younger son of the Dowager. He is a disciplinarian and Confucian scholar. Afraid his one surviving heir will turn bad, he imposes strict rules on his son, and uses occasional corporal punishment. He has a wife, Lady Wang, and one concubine: Zhao. He is a Confucian scholar who tries to live life as an upright and decent person, but out of touch with reality and a hands-off person at home and in court.\n* **Jia Lian** (賈璉; 贾琏; *Jiǎ Liǎn*; *Chia Lien*)   \nXifeng's husband and Baoyu's paternal elder cousin, a notorious womanizer whose numerous affairs cause much trouble with his jealous wife, including affairs with men that are not known by his wife. His pregnant concubine (Second Sister You) eventually dies by his wife's engineering. He and his wife are in charge of most hiring and monetary allocation decisions, and often fight over this power. He is a cad with a flawed character but still has a conscience.\n* **Xiangling** (香菱; *Xiāng Líng*; 'Fragrant Water caltrop'; Hawkes/Minford translation: Caltrop) – the Xues' maid, born Zhen Yinglian (甄英蓮, a homophone with \"deserving pity\"), the kidnapped and lost daughter of Zhen Shiyin (甄士隱, a homophone with \"Hiding the truth\"), the country gentleman in Chapter 1. Her name is changed to Qiuling (秋菱) by Xue Pan's spoiled wife, Xia Jingui (夏金桂) who is jealous of her and tries to poison her. Xue Pan makes her the lady of the house after Jingui's death. She soon dies while giving birth.\n* **Ping'er** (平兒; 'Peace'; Hawkes/Minford translation: Patience)   \nXifeng's chief maid and personal confidante; also concubine to Xifeng's husband, Jia Lian. Originally Xifeng's maid in the Wang household, she follows Xifeng as part of her dowry when Xifeng marries into the Jia household. She handles her troubles with grace, assists Xifeng capably and appears to have the respect of most of the household servants. She is also one of the very few people who can get close to Xifeng. She wields considerable power in the house as Xifeng's most trusted assistant, but uses her power sparingly and justly. She is supremely loyal to her mistress, but more soft-hearted and sweet-tempered.\n* **Xue Pan** (薛蟠; *Xuē Pán*; *Hsueh Pan*; 'to Coil (as a dragon)')   \nBaochai's older brother, a dissolute, idle rake who was a local bully in Jinling. He was known for his amorous exploits with both men and women. Not particularly well educated, he once killed a man over a servant-girl (Xiangling) and had the manslaughter case hushed up with money.\n* **Granny Liu** (劉姥姥; 刘姥姥; *Liú Lǎolao*)   \nA country rustic and distant relation to the Wang family, who provides a comic contrast to the ladies of the Rongguo House during two visits. She eventually rescues Qiaojie from her maternal uncle, who wanted to sell her.\n* **Lady Wang** (王夫人; *Wáng Fūren*)   \nA Buddhist, primary wife of Jia Zheng. Daughter of one of the four most prominent families of Jinling. Because of her purported ill-health, she hands over the running of the household to her niece, Xifeng, as soon as the latter marries into the Jia household, although she retains overall control over Xifeng's affairs so that the latter always has to report to her. Although Lady Wang appears to be a kind mistress and a doting mother, she can in fact be cruel and ruthless when her authority is challenged. She pays a great deal of attention to Baoyu's maids to make sure that Baoyu does not develop romantic relationships with them.\n* **Aunt Xue** (薛姨媽; 薛姨妈; *Xuē Yímā*), née Wang   \nBaoyu's maternal aunt, mother to Pan and Baochai, sister to Lady Wang. She is kindly and affable for the most part, but finds it hard to control her unruly son.\n* **Hua Xiren** (花襲人; 花袭人; *Huā Xírén*; 'Flower Assails Men'; Hawkes/Minford translation: Aroma)   \nBaoyu's principal maid and his unofficial concubine. While she still has standing as the Dowager's maid, the Dowager gave her to Baoyu so, in practice, Xiren is his maid. Considerate and forever worried about Baoyu, she is the partner of his first adolescent sexual encounter in the real world in Chapter 5. After Baoyu's disappearance, she unknowingly marries actor Jiang Yuhan, one of Baoyu's friends.\n\n\n![](image)Qingwen, painted by Xu Baozhuan\n* **Qingwen** (晴雯; *Qíngwén*; 'Sunny Multicolored Clouds'; Hawkes/Minford translation: Skybright)   \nBaoyu's personal maid. Brash, haughty and the most beautiful maid in the household, Qingwen is said to resemble Daiyu very strongly. Of all of Baoyu's maids, she is the only one who dares to argue with Baoyu when reprimanded, but is also extremely devoted to him. She is disdainful of Xiren's attempt to use her sexual relation with Baoyu to raise her status in the family. Lady Wang later suspected her of having an affair with Baoyu and publicly dismisses her on that account; angry at the unfair treatment and of the indignities and slanders that attended her as a result, Qingwen dies of an illness shortly after leaving the Jia household.\n* **Yuanyang** (鴛鴦; 鸳鸯; *Yuānyang*; 'Pair of Mandarin Ducks'; Hawkes/Minford translation: Faithful)   \nThe Dowager's chief maid. She rejects a marriage proposal (as concubine) to the lecherous Jia She, Grandmother Jia's eldest son and commits suicide right after the Dowager's death.\n* **Mingyan** (茗煙; 茗烟; *Míngyān*; 'Tea Vapor'; Hawkes/Minford translation: Tealeaf)   \nBaoyu's page boy. Knows his master like the back of his hand.\n* **Zijuan** (紫鵑; 紫鹃; *Zǐjuān*; *Tzu-chuan*; 'Purple Rhododendron or Cuckoo'; Hawkes/Minford translation: Nightingale)   \nDaiyu's faithful maid, ceded by the Dowager to her granddaughter. She later becomes a nun to serve Jia Xichun.\n* **Xueyan** (雪雁; *Xuěyàn*; Hawkes/Minford translation: Snowgoose)   \nDaiyu's other maid. She came with Daiyu from Yangzhou, and comes across as a young, sweet girl. She is asked to accompany the veiled bride Baochai to trick Baoyu into believing that he is marrying Daiyu.\n* **Concubine Zhao** (趙姨娘; 赵姨娘; *Zhào Yíniáng*)   \nA concubine of Jia Zheng. She is the mother of Jia Tanchun and Jia Huan, Baoyu's half-siblings. She longs to be the mother of the head of the household, which she does not achieve. She plots to murder Baoyu and Xifeng with black magic, and it is believed that her plot cost her own life.\n\n\n### Notable minor characters[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A scene from the story, painted by Xu Baozhuan\n* **Qin Zhong** (秦鐘, a homophone with \"great lover\") – His elder sister is Qin Keqing, Baoyu's nephew's wife, and so he is technically a generation younger than Baoyu. Both he and Qin Keqing are the adopted children of **Qin Ye**(秦業). The two boys enroll in the Jia clan's school together and he becomes Baoyu's best friend. The novel leaves open the possibility that things might have gone beyond innocent friendship. Qin Zhong and the novice **Zhineng** (智能, \"Intelligent\"; \"Sapientia\" in the Hawkes translation) fall in love but Qin Zhong dies soon after from a combination of his father's severe beating, sexual exhaustion, grief and remorse.[23] One commentator writes that Qin Zhong is a pun for *qingzhong* (passion incarnate), and that his sister **Qinshi** initiates Baoyu into heterosexual relations in his dream and Qin Zhong initiates him into homosexual ones.[24]\n* **Jia Lan** (賈蘭) – Son of Baoyu's deceased older brother Jia Zhu and his virtuous wife Li Wan. Jia Lan is an appealing child throughout the book and at the end succeeds in the imperial examinations to the credit of the family.\n* **Jia Zhen** (賈珍) – Head of the Ningguo House, the elder branch of the Jia family. He has a wife, Lady You, a younger sister, Jia Xichun, and many concubines. He is extremely greedy and the unofficial head of the clan, since his father has retired. He has an adulterous affair with his daughter-in-law, Qin Keqing.\n* **Lady You** (尤氏) – Wife of Jia Zhen. She is the sole mistress of the Ningguo House.\n* **Jia Rong** (賈蓉) – Jia Zhen's son. He is the husband of Qin Keqing. An exact copy of his father, he is the Cavalier of the Imperial Guards.\n* **Second Sister You** (尤二姐) – Jia Lian takes her in secret as his lover. Though a kept woman before she was married, after her wedding she becomes a faithful and doting wife. Because of Wang Xifeng's intrigue, she finally kills herself by swallowing a large piece of gold.\n* **Lady Xing** (邢夫人) – Jia She's wife. She is Jia Lian's stepmother.\n* **Jia Huan** (賈環) – Son of Concubine Zhao. He and his mother are both reviled by the family, and he carries himself like a kicked dog. He shows his malignant nature by spilling candle wax, intending to blind his half-brother Baoyu.\n* **Sheyue** (麝月; Hawkes/Minford translation: Musk) — Baoyu's main maid after Xiren and Qingwen. She is beautiful and caring, a perfect complement to Xiren.\n* **Qiutong** (秋桐) — Jia Lian's other concubine. Originally a maid of Jia She, she is given to Jia Lian as a concubine. She is a very proud and arrogant woman.\n* **Sister Sha** (傻大姐) – A maid who does rough work for the Dowager. She is guileless but amusing and caring. In the Gao E and Cheng Weiyuan version, she unintentionally informs Daiyu of Baoyu's secret marriage plans.\n\n\n## Themes[edit]\n\n\n\n> *Honglou meng* is a book about enlightenment [or awakening]. ... A man in his life experiences several decades of winter and summer. The most sagacious and wise is certainly not submerged in considerations of loss and gain. However, the experiences of prosperity and decline, coming together and dispersing [of family members and friends] are too common; how can his mind be like wood and stone, without being moved by all this? In the beginning there is a profusion of intimate feelings, which is followed by tears and lamentations. Finally, there is a time when one feels that everything he does is futile. At this moment, how can he not be enlightened?\n> \n> — A commentary on the novel by writer Jiang Shunyi, dated 1869[25]\n> \n\n\nThe opening chapter of the novel describes a great stone archway and on either side a couplet is inscribed:\n\n\n\n\n> 假作真時真亦假，  \n> \n> 無為有處有還無。  \n> \n>   \n> \n> Truth becomes fiction when the fiction's true;  \n> \n> Real becomes not-real where the unreal's real.\n> — *The Story of the Stone*\n> \n\n\nThis couplet is later reiterated, however this time as:\n\n\n\n\n> 假去真來真勝假，  \n> \n> 無原有是有非無。  \n> \n>   \n> \n> When Fiction departs and Truth appears, Truth prevails;   \n> \n> Though Not-real was once Real, the Real is never unreal.\n> — *The Story of the Stone*[26]\n> \n\n\nAs one critic points out, the couplet signifies \"not a hard and fast division between truth and falsity, reality and illusion, but the impossibility of making such distinctions in any world, fictional or actual.\"[27] This theme is further reflected in the name of the main family, Jia (賈, pronounced jiǎ), which is a homophone with the character jiǎ 假, meaning false or fictitious; this is mirrored the surname of the other main family, Zhen (甄, pronounced zhēn), a homophone for the word \"real\" (真). It is suggested that the novel is both a realistic reflection and a fictional or \"dream\" version of Cao's own family.\n\n\nEarly Chinese critics identified its two major themes as those of the nature of love, and of the transitoriness of earthly material values, as outlined in Buddhist and Taoist philosophies.[28] \nLater scholars echoed the philosophical aspects of love and its transcendent power as depicted in the novel.[29] One remarked that the novel is a remarkable example of the \"dialectic of dream and reality, art and life, passion and enlightenment, nostalgia and knowledge.\"[30]\n\n\nThe novel also vividly depicts Chinese material culture, such as medicine, cuisine, tea culture, festivities, proverbs, mythology, Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, filial piety, opera, music, architecture, funeral rites, painting, classic literature and the Four Books. Among these, the novel is particularly notable for its grand use of poetry.[31]\n\n\nSince the establishment of Cao Xueqin as the novel's author, its autobiographical aspects have come to the fore. Cao Xueqin's clan was similarly raided in real life, and suffered a steep decline. Marxist interpretation starting in the New Culture Movement saw the novel as exposing feudal society's corruption and emphasized the clashes between the classes. Since the 1980s, critics have embraced the novel's richness and aesthetics in a more multicultural context.[32]\n\n\nIn the title *Hóng lóu Mèng* (紅樓夢, literally \"Red Chamber Dream\"), \"red chamber\" can refer to the sheltered chambers where the daughters of a prominent family reside.[33] It also refers to Baoyu's dream in chapter five, set in a \"red chamber\", a dream where the fates of many of the characters are foreshadowed. \"Mansion\" is one of the definitions of the Chinese character \"樓\" (lóu), but the scholar Zhou Ruchang writes that in the phrase *hónglóu* it is more accurately translated as \"chamber\".[34]\n\n\n\n## Reception and influences in modern era[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The cover of a 1912 printed edition of the Youzheng version\nIn the late 19th century, *Hong Lou Meng*'s influence was so pervasive that the reformer Liang Qichao attacked it along with another classic novel *Water Margin* as \"incitement to robbery and lust\", and for smothering the introduction of Western style novels, which he regarded as more socially responsible.[35] The eminent scholar Wang Guowei, however, achieved a new method of literary interpretation in an innovative and path-breaking 1904 essay which invoked the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer. Wang called the novel \"the tragedy of tragedies\", in contrast to the prosperous endings in most earlier drama and fiction.[36] Wang further proclaims the novel as \"[W]orthy of being considered as the one great masterpiece in the realm of Chinese art.\"[37]\n\n\nIn the early 20th century, although the New Culture Movement took a critical view of the Confucian classics, the scholar Hu Shih used the tools of textual criticism to put the novel in an entirely different light, as a foundation for national culture. Hu and his students, Gu Jiegang and Yu Pingbo, first established that Cao Xueqin was the work's author. Taking the question of authorship seriously reflected a new respect for fiction, since the lesser forms of literature had not been traditionally ascribed to particular individuals.[38] Hu next built on Cai Yuanpei's investigations of the printing history of the early editions to prepare reliable reading texts. The final, and in some respects most important task, was to study the vocabulary and usage of Cao's Beijing dialect as a basis for Modern Mandarin.\n\n\nIn the 1920s, scholars and devoted readers developed *Hongxue*, or Redology into both a scholarly field and a popular avocation. Among the avid readers was the young Mao Zedong, who later claimed to have read the novel five times and praised it as one of China's greatest works of literature.[39] The influence of the novel's themes and style are evident in many modern Chinese prose works. The early 1950s was a rich period for Redology with publication of major studies by Yu Pingbo. Zhou Ruchang, who as a young scholar had come to the attention of Hu Shih in the late 1940s, published his first study in 1953, which became a best seller.[40] But in 1954 Mao personally criticized Yu Pingbo for his \"bourgeois idealism\" in failing to emphasize that the novel exposed the decadence of \"feudal\" society and the theme of class struggle. In the Hundred Flowers Campaign, Yu came under heavy criticism but the attacks were so extensive and full of quotations from his work that they spread Yu's ideas to many people who would not otherwise have known of their existence.[41]\n\n\nDuring the Cultural Revolution, the novel initially came under fire, though it quickly regained its prestige in the following years. Zhou Ruchang resumed his lifework, eventually publishing more than sixty biographical and critical studies.[40] In 2006, Zhou, who had long distrusted Gao E's editions, and the novelist Liu Xinwu, author of popular studies of the novel, joined to produce a new 80 chapter version which Zhou had edited to eliminate the Cheng-Gao emendations. Liu completed an ending that was supposedly more true to Cao's original intent.[42] The novel continues to be influential on contemporary Chinese poets such as Middle Generation's An Qi, who paid homage to it in her poem *To Cao Xueqin*.[43]\n\n\n\n## Translations and reception in the West[edit]\n\n\n\n> ... one of the great monuments of the world's literature ...\n> \n> — Review of the *Dream of the Red Chamber* by Anthony West, *The New Yorker*[44]\n> \n\n\nCao utilizes many levels of colloquial and literary language and incorporates forms of classic poetry that are integral to the novel, making it a major challenge to translate.[45] A 2014 study of fourteen translations of the novel concluded that the work is a \"challenge even to the most resourceful of translators, and the process of rendering it into another language is bound to involve more translation problems, techniques, and principles than the process of rendering any other literary work.\" Accordingly, the aims and achievements of the translators differ widely.[46]\n\n\nThe first recorded translation into English was in 1812 by the Protestant missionary and sinologist Robert Morrison (1782–1834), who translated part of chapter four for the second volume of his unpublished 1812 book *Horae Sinicae*. In 1816, Morrison did publish a translation of a conversation from chapter 31 in his Chinese language textbook *Dialogues and Detached Sentences in the Chinese Language*. In 1819, the British diplomat and sinologist John Francis Davis (1795–1890) published a short excerpt in the *London Journal Quarterly Review*. Davis also published a poem from chapter 3 in the 1830 *Transactions* of the Royal Asiatic Society.[47] In 1842, Karl Gützlaff's article, \"Hung Lau Mung, or Dreams in the Red Chamber\", in the sixth volume of the \"Chinese Repository\", included translation and criticism of some passages.\n\n\nA literal translation of selected passages was published for foreigners learning Chinese by the Presbyterian Mission Press of Ningbo in 1846.[48] Edward Charles Bowra of the Chinese Imperial Maritime Customs published a translation of the first eight chapters in 1868[49] and H. Bencraft Joly of the first fifty-six chapters in 1892.[50] The Reverend E.J. Eitel reviewed Joly's translation and condemned the novel, saying that Chinese read it \"because of its wickedness.\" Herbert Giles, whom John Minford called \"one of the more free-thinking British consular officers,\" took a more favorable view in a twenty-five page synopsis in 1885 that Minford calls still a \"useful guide.\"[51] \nGiles further highlighted it in his *A History of Chinese Literature* in 1901.[52]\n\n\nIn 1928, Elfrida Hudson published a short introduction to the novel titled \"An old, old story\".[53] An abridged translation by Wang Chi-Chen which emphasized the central love story was published in 1929, with a preface by Arthur Waley. Waley said that \"we feel most clearly the symbolic or universal value\" of the characters in the passages which recount dreams. \"Pao Yu\", Waley continued, stands for \"imagination and poetry\" and his father for \"all those sordid powers of pedantry and restriction which hamper the artist\".[54] In a 1930 review of Wang's translation, Harry Clemons of *The Virginia Quarterly Review* wrote \"This is a great novel\", and along with the *Romance of the Three Kingdoms*, it \"ranks foremost\" among the novels of classic Chinese literature.[55] Although Clemons felt \"meaning was only fragmentarily revealed\" in the English translated prose and that \"many of the incidents\" and \"much of the poetry\" were omitted, he nevertheless thought \"at any rate the effort to read *The Dream of the Red Chamber* is eminently worth making.\"[55] In 1958 Wang published an expansion on his earlier abridgement, though it was still truncated at 60 chapters. \n\n\nThe stream of translations and literary studies in the West grew steadily, building on Chinese language scholarship. The 1932 German translation by Franz Kuhn[56] was the basis of an abridged version, *The Dream of the Red Chamber*, by Florence and Isabel McHugh published in 1958,[57] and a later French version. Critic Anthony West wrote in *The New Yorker* in 1958 that the novel is to the Chinese \"very much what *The Brothers Karamazov* is to Russian and *Remembrance of Things Past* is to French literature\" and \"it is beyond question one of the great novels of all literature.\"[44] Kenneth Rexroth in a 1958 review of the McHugh translation, describes the novel as among the \"greatest works of prose fiction in all the history of literature\", for it is \"profoundly humane\".[58] Bramwell Seaton Bonsall finished what is probably the first complete 120 chapter translation in the 1950s, *Red Chamber Dream*, but publication was abandoned when Penguin announced the Hawkes project. A typescript is available on the web.[59]\n\n\nThe respected and prolific Yang Hsien-yi was commissioned to translate the first complete English version. Though he confessed that this was his least favorite of the classic novels, Yang began work in 1961 and had finished roughly 100 chapters in 1964, when he was ordered to stop. He and his wife, Gladys Yang, were imprisoned on suspicion of espionage during the Cultural Revolution, but they finished the translation as a team after their release in 1974. It was published by Beijing Foreign Language Press as *A Dream of Red Mansions*, in three volumes, 1978–1980.[60] The second complete English translation to be published was by David Hawkes some century and a half after the first English translation. Hawkes was already a recognised redologist and had previously translated *Chu Ci* when Penguin Classics approached him in 1970 to make a translation which could appeal to English readers. After resigning from his professorial position, Hawkes published the first eighty chapters in three volumes (1973, 1977, 1980).[61] *The Story of the Stone* (1973–1980), the first eighty chapters translated by Hawkes and last forty by his son-in-law John Minford consists of five volumes and 2,339 pages of actual core text (not including Prefaces, Introductions and Appendices) and over 2,800 pages in total.[62] The word count of the Penguin Classics English translation is estimated at 845,000 words. In a 1980 review of the Hawkes and Minford translation in *The New York Review of Books*, Frederic Wakeman, Jr. described the novel as a \"masterpiece\" and the work of a \"literary genius\".[63] Cynthia L. Chennault of the University of Florida stated that \"The *Dream* is acclaimed as one of the most psychologically penetrating novels of world literature.\"[64] The novel and its author have been described as among the most significant works of literature and literary figures of the past millennium.[65][66]\n\n\nThe sinologist Oldřich Král also undertook a Czech translation of the entire novel, *Sen v červeném domě* (Prague: Odeon, three volumes, 1986–1988). Slovak sinologist and philosopher Marina Čarnogurská translated into Slovak whole four volumes of the novel, *Sen o Červenom pavilóne* (Bratislava: Petrus, 2001–2003. ISBN 80-88939-25-9).\n\n\nIn 2014, an abridged English translation of *Dream* by writer Lin Yutang resurfaced in a Japanese library. Lin's translation, about half the length of the original, is reportedly not a literal one.[67]\n\n\nIn a study of fourteen translations into English, German, French, Spanish, Laurence K.P. Wong finds that some challenges to translation are \"surmountable\", some \"insurmountable,\" though translators sometimes hit on \"surprisingly happy versions that come very close to the original,\" Hawkes, however, normally came up with versions that are \"accurate, ingenious, and delightful....\" Hawkes recreates the meanings and sounds of the original with \"remarkable precision, achieving much greater success than any one of his fellow translators in surmounting the limits of literary translation....\"[68] Another scholar agreed that the Yang's translation is \"literal\" in the sense of rendering word for word, but argued that the Hawkes translation achieved what should be called a \"higher level of literalness: in the sense of \"text for text.\" That is, Hawkes tries to maintain the range and contrasting levels of usage of the original while the Yangs smooth out the language with a \"plain international English\" and add explanations in footnotes.[69]\n\n\nOther scholars examined particular aspects of the Yangs' translation and the Hawkes and Minford translation. The names of some characters sound like the words for their personality traits, and some names serve as allusions. Hawkes conveys the communicative function of the names rather than lexical equivalence; for example, Huo Qi is homonymous with \"the beginning of catastrophe\", and Hawkes makes the English name \"Calamity\". Hawkes sometimes uses Italian/Sanskrit terms when Western Christian culture lacks a term for a concept.[70] Gladys Yang and Yang Hsien-yi prefer literal translation, informing readers of names' meanings through annotations. Zhu Jian-chun argued that Hawkes’ choice to simply translate certain names that are puns makes the author's intentions clearer, and that the Yangs' choice of transliteration leaves the meaning more elusive, even if the transliterated names are more believable as character names. Zhu questioned the Yangs' translation of \"Dao Ren\" as \"reverend\".[70] According to Barry Lee Reynolds and Chao-Chih Liao, the Yangs' version contains more faithful translations of religious expressions but is also less readable to English language readers.[71] Xuxiang Suo argued, “Hawkes successfully conveyed the original textual information to foreign readers with smooth and beautiful English, but the loss of Chinese culture-loaded information is inevitable. Mr. Yang mostly adopted the way of literal translation, trying his best to keep the true and idiomatic Chinese style and national tint.\"[72]\n\n\n\n## Sequels and continuations[edit]\n\n\nOwing to its immense popularity, numerous sequels and continuations to the novel have been published, even during the Qing era. There are currently more than thirty recorded sequels or continuations to the novel, including modern ones.[73] Modern (post-1949) continuations tend to follow after the eightieth chapter, and include those by Zhang Zhi,[74] Zhou Yuqing,[75] Hu Nan[76] and Liu Xinwu.[77]\n\n\n\n## Adaptations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A scene from *Dream of the Red Chamber* as depicted in Chinese opera\nAt least fourteen cinematic adaptations of the *Dream of the Red Chamber* have been made, including the 1944 film directed by Bu Wancang, the Hong Kong Shaw Brothers adaptation starring Sylvia Chang and Brigitte Lin, and the 1988 film directed by Xie Tieli (谢铁骊) and Zhao Yuan (赵元). This last film took two years to prepare and three years to shoot, and remains, at 735 minutes, the longest Chinese film ever made.[78]\n\n\nIn 1981, Jiangsu Song and Dance Ensemble premiered a dance drama version of *Dream of the Red Chamber*. A reworked version was performed in 1982 in Beijing by China Opera and Dance Drama Theatre featuring lead dancer Chen Ailian.[79]\n\n\nAt least ten television adaptations have been produced (excluding numerous Chinese opera adaptations), and they include the renowned 1987 television series, which is regarded by many within China as being a near-definitive adaptation of the novel. It was initially somewhat controversial as few Redologists believed a TV adaptation could do the novel full justice. Producer and director Wang Fulin's decision in employing non-professional young actors was vindicated as the TV series gained enormous popularity in China. The series' success owes much to composer Wang Liping (王立平). He set many of the novel's classical verses to music, taking as long as four years to deliberate and complete his compositions. Other television versions include a 1996 Taiwanese series and a 2010 version directed by Fifth Generation director Li Shaohong.\n\n\nUnlike the other great Chinese novels, particularly *Romance of the Three Kingdoms* and *Journey to the West*, the *Dream of the Red Chamber* has received little attention in the gaming world, with only two Chinese language visual novels having been released as of 2017. *Hong Lou Meng* and *Hong Lou Meng: Lin Daiyu yu Bei Jingwang* (红楼梦：林黛玉与北静王) were both released by Beijing Entertainment All Technology (北京娱乐通). The latter one was released on 8 January 2010, and it is an extended version of the first game, with the main heroines of the game fully voiced and additional CG+endings.\n\n\nAn English-language opera based on the novel in two acts was composed by Chinese American composer Bright Sheng, with libretto by Sheng and David Henry Hwang. The three-hour opera had its world premiere on 10 September 2016, by the San Francisco Opera. For their 2020 album, *Transience of Life*, the American art-rock band Elysian Fields set several poems from the novel to music.\n\n\nIn the 2023 video game *Limbus Company* created by South Korean studio Project Moon, character Hong Lu is based off of *Dream of the Red Chamber*. He is one of the 12 playable sinners in the game, and wields a guandao.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image) Novels portal\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"CliffsNotes, About the Novel: Introduction\".

In chapter 1, after a second perusal of the book, Voiding-the-Void Daoist (supposedly its first reader) concludes that \"its main theme is about love.\" \"Love\" is perhaps an inadequate rendering of *qing*, whose range of associations includes desire, affection, feelings, emotions, sentiments, sentience. It is also linked to subjective consciousness, imagination, aesthetic sensibility. Cao Xueqin idealizes *qing* and raises its transcendent dimension to an almost metaphysical level; in doing so he also emphasizes lyrical self-containment, the power of the mind to dream and imagine a world, and the conception of the romantic-aesthetic as an alternate sphere of existence. [...] To know love is to apprehend its implacable negation.\n30. **^** Shulman, David; Stroumsa, Guy G., eds. (1999). *Dream Cultures: Explorations in the Comparative History of Dreaming*.
