Created in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg with four other Harvard College students and roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes, its name derives from the face book directories often given to American university students. Membership was initially limited to Harvard students, gradually expanding to other North American universities. Since 2006, Facebook allows everyone to register from 13 years old (or older), except in the case of a handful of nations, where the age limit is 14 years.[6] As of December 2022[update], Facebook claimed 3 billion monthly active users.[7] As of October 2023 Facebook ranked as the 3rd most visited website in the world with 22.56% of its traffic coming from the United States.[8][9] It was the most downloaded mobile app of the 2010s.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n53. **^** Buley, Taylor. \"Facebook's Russian Frenemy With Benefits\". *Forbes*.

Zuckerberg faced expulsion and was charged with breaching security, violating copyrights and violating individual privacy.

By contrast, most goods are available to a limited number of users. E.g., if one user buys a phone, no other user can buy that phone. Three areas add the most economic impact: platform competition, the market place and user behavior data.[606]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n141. **^** Isaac, Mike; Nicas, Jack (November 15, 2018). \"Facebook Cuts Ties With Definers Public Affairs Following Outcry\". *The New York Times*.

By contrast, most goods are available to a limited number of users. E.g., if one user buys a phone, no other user can buy that phone. Three areas add the most economic impact: platform competition, the market place and user behavior data.[606]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n141. **^** Isaac, Mike; Nicas, Jack (November 15, 2018). \"Facebook Cuts Ties With Definers Public Affairs Following Outcry\". *The New York Times*.

The trio were early employees of PayPal, which left them enriched after the company was bought by eBay.[14] Hurley had studied design at the Indiana University of Pennsylvania, and Chen and Karim studied computer science together at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.[15]\n\n\nAccording to a story that has often been repeated in the media, Hurley and Chen developed the idea for YouTube during the early months of 2005, after they had experienced difficulty sharing videos that had been shot at a dinner party at Chen's apartment in San Francisco. Karim did not attend the party and denied that it had occurred, but Chen remarked that the idea that YouTube was founded after a dinner party \"was probably very strengthened by marketing ideas around creating a story that was very digestible\".[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n203. **^** Kincaid, Jason (July 7, 2010). \"YouTube Mobile Goes HTML5, Video Quality Beats Native Apps Hands Down\". *TechCrunch*.

Karim could not easily find video clips of the incident and the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami online, which led to the idea of a video-sharing site.[17] Hurley and Chen said that the original idea for YouTube was a video version of an online dating service and had been influenced by the website Hot or Not.[16][18] They created posts on Craigslist asking attractive women to upload videos of themselves to YouTube in exchange for a $100 reward.[19] Difficulty in finding enough dating videos led to a change of plans, with the site's founders deciding to accept uploads of any video.[20]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n84. **^** Spangler, Todd (February 24, 2021). \"YouTube New 'Supervised' Mode Will Let Parents Restrict Older Kids' Video Viewing\". *Variety*.

Titled \"Me at the zoo\", it shows co-founder Jawed Karim at the San Diego Zoo and can still be viewed on the site.[24][25] In May, the company launched a public beta and by November, a Nike ad featuring Ronaldinho became the first video to reach one million total views.[26][27] The site launched officially on December 15, 2005, by which time the site was receiving 8 million views a day.[28][29] Clips at the time were limited to 100 megabytes, as little as 30 seconds of footage.[30]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n477. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Anderson, Chris (July 2010). \"How web video powers global innovation\".

Following public outrage over the unprecedented amount of unskippable ads, YouTube \"ended\" the experiment on September 19 of that year.[93] In October, YouTube announced that they would be rolling out customizable user handles (e.g. @MrBeast6000) in addition to channel names, which would also become channel URLs.[94]\n\n\nOn February 16, 2023, Wojcicki announced that she would step down as CEO, with Neal Mohan named as her successor.

Karim did not attend the party and denied that it had occurred, but Chen remarked that the idea that YouTube was founded after a dinner party \"was probably very strengthened by marketing ideas around creating a story that was very digestible\".[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n203. **^** Kincaid, Jason (July 7, 2010). \"YouTube Mobile Goes HTML5, Video Quality Beats Native Apps Hands Down\". *TechCrunch*.

Acton encouraged him to wait for a \"few more months\".[62]\n\n\nIn June 2009, when the app had been downloaded by only a handful of Fishman's Russian-speaking friends, Apple launched push notifications, allowing users to be pinged even when not using the app.\n\n\nKoum updated WhatsApp so that everyone in the user's network would be notified when a user's status changed.

According to *Globes*, already by 2013 the application was installed on 92% of all smartphones, with 86% of users reporting daily use.[358]\n\n\n\n### Competition[edit]\n\n\nWhatsApp competes with a number of messaging services. They include services like iMessage (estimated 1.3 billion active users[359]), WeChat (1.26 billion active users[360][361]), Telegram (700 million users[362]), Viber (260 million active users[363]), LINE (217 million active users[364]), KakaoTalk (57 million active users[365]), and Signal (40 million active users[366]). Both Telegram and Signal in particular were reported to get registration spikes during WhatsApp outages and controversies.[367][368][369]\n\n\nWhatsApp has increasingly drawn its innovation from competing services,[370] such as a Telegram-inspired web version[371] and features for groups.[372] In 2016, WhatsApp was accused of copying features from a then-unreleased version of iMessage.[373]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhatsApp handled ten billion messages per day in August 2012,[341] growing from two billion in April 2012,[342] and one billion the previous October.[343] On June 13, 2013, WhatsApp announced that they had reached their new daily record by processing 27 billion messages.[344] According to the *Financial Times*, WhatsApp \"has done to SMS on mobile phones what Skype did to international calling on landlines\".[345]\n\n\nBy April 22, 2014, WhatsApp had over 500 million monthly active users, 700 million photos and 100 million videos were being shared daily, and the messaging system was handling more than 10 billion messages each day.[346][347]\n\n\nOn August 24, 2014, Koum announced on his Twitter account that WhatsApp had over 600 million active users worldwide. At that point WhatsApp was adding about 25 million new users every month, or 833,000 active users per day.[86][348]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n45. **^** \"(Updated) WhatsApp begins crackdown on unlicensed 3rd party clients\". *Androidauthority.com*.

The app collected data on who the users contacted and how often, and when and how they were using the app. This is reportedly not an isolated occurrence, as federal agencies can use the Electronic Communications Privacy Act to covertly track users without submitting any probable cause or linking a user's number to their identity.[276]\n\n\nAt the beginning of 2022, it was revealed that San Diego-based startup Boldend had developed tools to hack WhatsApp's encryption, gaining access to user data, at some point since the startup's inception in 2017. The vulnerability was reportedly patched in January 2021. Boldend is financed, in part, by Peter Thiel, a notable investor in Facebook.[277]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter months at beta stage, the official first release of WhatsApp for iOS launched in November 2009. In January 2010, support for BlackBerry smartphones was added; and subsequently for Symbian OS in May 2010, and for Android OS in August 2010. In August 2011, a beta for Nokia's non-smartphone OS Series 40 was added. A month later, support for Windows Phone was added, followed by BlackBerry 10 in March 2013.[170] In April 2015, support for Samsung's Tizen OS was added.[171] The oldest device capable of running WhatsApp was the Symbian-based Nokia N95 released in March 2007, but support was later discontinued.\n\n\nIn August 2014, WhatsApp released an update, adding support for Android Wear smartwatches.[172]\n\n\nOn January 21, 2015, WhatsApp launched WhatsApp Web, a browser-based web client that could be used by syncing with a mobile device's connection.[173]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_FbW8F6779yzgtojPMJYPHGMN","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

He officially joined WhatsApp on November 1.[27] Koum then hired a friend in Los Angeles, Chris Peiffer, to develop a BlackBerry version, which arrived two months later.[27] Subsequently, WhatsApp for Symbian OS was added in May 2010, and for Android OS in August 2010.[64] In 2010 Google made multiple acquisition offers for WhatsApp, which were all declined.[65]\n\n\nTo cover the cost of sending verification texts to users, WhatsApp was changed from a free service to a paid one. In December 2009, the ability to send photos was added to the iOS version. By early 2011, WhatsApp was one of the top 20 apps in the U.S. Apple App Store.[27]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Horwitz, Jeff (February 12, 2020). \"As WhatsApp Tops 2 Billion Users, Its Boss Vows to Defend Encryption\". *Wall Street Journal*.

(now Meta Platforms) announced it was acquiring WhatsApp for US$19 billion, its largest acquisition to date.[23] At the time, it was the largest acquisition of a venture-capital-backed company in history.[22] Sequoia Capital received an approximate 5,000% return on its initial investment.[75] Facebook, which was advised by Allen & Co, paid $4 billion in cash, $12 billion in Facebook shares, and, advised by Morgan Stanley, an additional $3 billion in restricted stock units granted to WhatsApp's founders Koum and Acton.[76] Employee stock was scheduled to vest over four years subsequent to closing.[23] Days after the announcement, WhatsApp users experienced a loss of service, leading to anger across social media.[77]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nKoum named the app WhatsApp to sound like \"what's up\". On February 24, 2009, he incorporated[63] WhatsApp Inc. in California. However, when early versions of WhatsApp kept crashing, Koum considered giving up and looking for a new job. Acton encouraged him to wait for a \"few more months\".[62]\n\n\nIn June 2009, when the app had been downloaded by only a handful of Fishman's Russian-speaking friends, Apple launched push notifications, allowing users to be pinged even when not using the app.\n\n\nKoum updated WhatsApp so that everyone in the user's network would be notified when a user's status changed. This new facility, to Koum's surprise, was used by users to ping \"each other with jokey custom statuses like, 'I woke up late' or 'I'm on my way.'\"[62]\n\n\nFishman said \"At some point it sort of became instant messaging\".[62]\n\n\nWhatsApp 2.0, released for iPhone in August 2009, featured a purpose-designed messaging component; the number of active users suddenly increased to 250,000.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n110. **^** Lomas, Natasha (September 26, 2018). \"WhatsApp founder, Brian Acton, says Facebook used him to get its acquisition past EU regulators\". *TechCrunch*.\n111. **^** Stangel, Luke (June 6, 2018). \"WhatsApp founders Jan Koum and Brian Acton, desperate to quit Facebook, reportedly left $1.3 billion in stock options behind\". *Silicon Valley Business Journal*.\n112. **^** Wagner, Kurt (May 8, 2018). \"WhatsApp has a new boss: Chris Daniels, the guy who's been running Internet.org\". *Recode*.

These could be a social networking service like Facebook, a messaging service, maybe search and other things like weather. Providing a bundle of these free of charge to users will work like a gateway drug of sorts – users who may be able to afford data services and phones these days just don't see the point of why they would pay for those data services. This would give them some context for why they are important, and that will lead them to pay for more services like this – or so the hope goes.[83]\n> \n> \n\n\nThree days after announcing the Facebook purchase, Koum said they were working to introduce voice calls.

Text formatting options like code blocks, quote blocks, and bulleted lists and became available for the first time.

The app collected data on who the users contacted and how often, and when and how they were using the app. This is reportedly not an isolated occurrence, as federal agencies can use the Electronic Communications Privacy Act to covertly track users without submitting any probable cause or linking a user's number to their identity.[276]\n\n\nAt the beginning of 2022, it was revealed that San Diego-based startup Boldend had developed tools to hack WhatsApp's encryption, gaining access to user data, at some point since the startup's inception in 2017. The vulnerability was reportedly patched in January 2021. Boldend is financed, in part, by Peter Thiel, a notable investor in Facebook.[277]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter months at beta stage, the official first release of WhatsApp for iOS launched in November 2009. In January 2010, support for BlackBerry smartphones was added; and subsequently for Symbian OS in May 2010, and for Android OS in August 2010. In August 2011, a beta for Nokia's non-smartphone OS Series 40 was added. A month later, support for Windows Phone was added, followed by BlackBerry 10 in March 2013.[170] In April 2015, support for Samsung's Tizen OS was added.[171] The oldest device capable of running WhatsApp was the Symbian-based Nokia N95 released in March 2007, but support was later discontinued.\n\n\nIn August 2014, WhatsApp released an update, adding support for Android Wear smartwatches.[172]\n\n\nOn January 21, 2015, WhatsApp launched WhatsApp Web, a browser-based web client that could be used by syncing with a mobile device's connection.[173]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_FbW8F6779yzgtojPMJYPHGMN","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

This feature allows users to share updates as short text posts of up to 60 characters with certain people, who can then reply to them using messaging on Instagram.[116][117]\n\n\nIn February 2023, Instagram introduced a new feature allowing users to browse and post GIFs in their comments.[118] That same month, Zuckerberg announced that Meta would start selling blue \"verified\" badges on Instagram and Facebook.[119]\n\n\nOn July 5, 2023, Meta launched Threads, a social network platform connected to Instagram that allows users to make public shortform blog posts comprising text, photos, and videos, as well as to converse with other users and reblog other users' posts. Threads aims to compete with Twitter.[120][121][122]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn March 2020, Instagram launched a new feature called \"Co-Watching\". The new feature allows users to share posts with each other over video calls. According to Instagram, they pushed forward the launch of Co-Watching in order to meet the demand for virtually connecting with friends and family due to social distancing as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.[94]\n\n\nIn August 2020, Instagram began a pivot to video, introducing a new feature called \"Reels\".[95][96][97] The intent was to compete with the video-sharing site TikTok.[97][98][95] Instagram also added suggested posts in August 2020. After scrolling through posts from the past 48 hours, Instagram displays posts related to their interests from accounts they do not follow.[99]\n\n\nIn February 2021, Instagram began testing a new feature called Vertical Stories, said by some sources to be inspired by TikTok.[100] The same month, they also began testing the removal of ability to share feed posts to stories.[101]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n60. **^** Perez, Sarah (May 11, 2016). \"Instagram's big redesign goes live with a colorful new icon, black-and-white app and more\". *TechCrunch*.

In September 2022, Ireland's Data Protection Commission fined the company $402 million under privacy laws recently adopted by the European Union over how it handled the privacy data of minors.[112][113][114]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nInstagram was originally distinguished by allowing content to be framed only in a square (1:1) aspect ratio of 640 pixels to match the display width of the iPhone at the time. In 2015, this restriction was eased with an increase to 1080 pixels. It also added messaging features, the ability to include multiple images or videos in a single post, and a Stories feature—similar to its main competitor Snapchat—which allowed users to post their content to a sequential feed, with each post accessible to others for 24 hours. As of January 2019, Stories is used by 500 million people daily.[11]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n390. **^** Bakhshi, Saeideh; Shamma, David A.; Gilbert, Eric (2014). \"Faces engage us\". *Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems*. pp. 965–974. doi:10.1145/2556288.2557403.

Mayer on 27 August 2020.[45][46][47]\n\n\nIn September 2021, TikTok reported that it had reached 1 billion users.[48] In 2021, TikTok earned $4 billion in advertising revenue.[49]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n218. **^** Sung, Morgan (11 November 2022). \"Some OnlyFans creators have found a loophole to put their nudes on TikTok\".

Lawmakers also \"hammered\" TikTok about whether consumer data could be turned over to Beijing through ByteDance, its parent company in China.[255] TikTok said it does not give information to China's government and \"U.S. user data\" is stored within the country with backups in Singapore. According to the company's representative, TikTok had \"no affiliation\" with the subsidiary Beijing ByteDance Technology, in which the Chinese government has a minority stake and board seat.[256]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn June 2023 *The New Zealand Herald* reported that TikTok, working in cooperation with both New Zealand and Australian police, deleted 340 accounts and 2,000 videos associated with criminal gangs including the Mongrel Mob, Black Power, Killer Beez, the Comancheros, Mongols, and Rebels. TikTok had earlier drawn criticism for hosting content by organised crime groups promoting the gang lifestyle and fights. A TikTok spokesperon reiterated the platform's efforts to countering \"violent\" and \"hateful\" organisations' content and cooperating with police. New Zealand Police Commissioner Andrew Coster praised the platform for taking a \"socially-responsible stance\" against gangs.[400]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of most-followed TikTok accounts\n* Musical.ly\n* Timeline of social media\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Strictly legal explainers are still available on topics such as same-sex marriage.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn February, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman criticized the app, calling it \"spyware\".[246][247] TikTok said the accusations were made without evidence.[243]\n\n\nIn July, Wells Fargo banned the app from company devices due to privacy and security concerns.[248]\n\n\nIn August 2020, *The Wall Street Journal* reported that TikTok tracked Android user data, including MAC addresses and IMEIs, with a tactic in violation of Google's policies.[249][250] The report sparked calls in the U.S. Senate for the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to launch an investigation.[251]\n\n\nA March 2021 study by the Citizen Lab found that TikTok did not collect data beyond the industry norms, what its policy stated, or without additional user permission.[167]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe \"For You\" page on TikTok is a feed of videos that are recommended to users based on their activity on the app. Content is curated by TikTok's artificial intelligence depending on the content a user liked, interacted with, or searched. This is in contrast to other social networks' algorithms basing such content off of the user's relationships with other users and what they liked or interacted with.[88]\n\n\nThe app's \"react\" feature allows users to film their reaction to a specific video, over which it is placed in a small window that is movable around the screen.[89] Its \"duet\" feature allows users to film a video aside from another video.[90] The \"duet\" feature was another trademark of musical.ly. The duet feature is also only able to be used if both parties adjust the privacy settings.[91]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSome small businesses have used TikTok to advertise and to reach an audience wider than the geographical region they would normally serve. The viral response to many small business TikTok videos has been attributed to TikTok's algorithm, which shows content that viewers at large are drawn to, but which they are unlikely to actively search for (such as videos on unconventional types of businesses, like beekeeping and logging).[210]\n\n\nIn 2020, digital media companies such as Group Nine Media and Global used TikTok increasingly, focusing on tactics such as brokering partnerships with TikTok influencers and developing branded content campaigns.[211] Notable collaborations between larger brands and top TikTok influencers have included Chipotle's partnership with David Dobrik in May 2019[212] and Dunkin' Donuts' partnership with Charli D'Amelio in September 2020.[213]\n\n\n\n### Sex workers[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n255. **^** McCabe, David; Conger, Kate; Wakabayashi, Daisuke (26 October 2021). \"YouTube, Snap and TikTok executives take their turn answering to Washington\". *The New York Times*.

In December 2021, *Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery*, the journal of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, published an article about the popularity of some plastic surgeons on TikTok. In the article, it was noted that plastic surgeons were some of the earliest adopters of social media in the medical field and many had been recognized as influencers on the platform. The article published stats about the most popular plastic surgeons on TikTok up to February 2021 and at the time, five different plastic surgeons had surpassed 1 million followers on the platform.[145][146]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to a 2020 article in *The New York Times*, CIA analysts determined that while it is possible the Chinese government could obtain user information from the app, there was no evidence it had done so.[336] Several independent cybersecurity experts have also concluded that there is no determinable evidence that user information was being or had been obtained by the Chinese government, although they note that the amount of data that the app collects is of comparable volume to other social media apps, including U.S.-based platforms such as Facebook and Twitter.[337][338]\n\n\nOn 6 August 2020, then U.S. President Donald Trump signed an order[339][340] which would ban TikTok transactions in 45 days if it was not sold by ByteDance.

The differences between Douyin and TikTok have led some US politicians and commentators to accuse the company or the Chinese government of malicious intent.[200][201] In March 2023, TikTok announced default screen time limits for users under the age of 18. Those under the age of 13 would need a passcode from their parents to extend their time.[200]\n\n\n\n### Influencer marketing[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe hashtags #TikTokFood and #FoodTok are used to identify food-related content,[135] and have been viewed 40.2 billion and 9.7 billion times respectively since the app's creation, according to the company. Food trends have had profound societal impacts on their millions of viewers.[134] There has been increased popularity in youth cooking, conversations on body image, use of marketing of food products on social media, and food shortages due to mass trends.[136][137][138] Certain TikTok content creators such as Eitan Bernath, Jeron Combs, and Emily Mariko have achieved fame by crafting recipes that have become food trends. They and their colleagues have developed recipes such as the leftover salmon bowl, baked feta cheese pasta, and pesto eggs.[139][140][141]\n\n#### Fashion and body size[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Model (people) § Types\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_cLLWjaO2wF3VaqQASvLeGmqF","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
