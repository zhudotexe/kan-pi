For size and location reference, four very large continental landmasses are also shown.\n\n\n\n\n## Continental landmasses[edit]\n\n\nContinental landmasses are not usually classified as islands despite being completely surrounded by water.[Note 1] However, because the definition of continent varies between geographers, the Americas are sometimes defined as two separate continents while mainland Australia is sometimes defined as an island as well as a continent. Nevertheless, for the purposes of this list, mainland Australia along with the other major landmasses have been listed as continental landmasses for comparison. The figures are approximations and are for the four major continental landmasses only.[Note 2] The artificial Panama and Suez canals are disregarded, as they are not natural waters that separate the

The United States-based scientific agency considers all landmasses surrounded by ocean water, including continental mainlands, as islands. Under their definition, Africa, Australia, Eurasia, North America, and South America are classified as continental mainland islands.[1]\n2. **^** Physiographically, there are only four continents (including offshore continental islands which sit on the nearby continental shelves) that are completely surrounded by water: Afro-Eurasia (57% of the global land area), the Americas (28.5%), Antarctica (9%), and Australia (5%). The remaining 0.5% is made up of remote oceanic islands, mostly scattered within Oceania in the central and south Pacific Ocean.[2]\n3. **^** Including landmasses which are above water and over 2,500,000 km2 (970,000 sq mi). The submerged continent of Zealandia (approx. 5,000,000 km2 (1,900,000 sq mi)) is excluded.[3]\n4. **^** Figure derived from the Global Islands Explorer website, by adding the areas of mainland Africa (29,370,907 km2 (11,340,171 sq mi)) and mainland Eurasia (50,439,819 km2 (19,474,923 sq mi)).\n5. **^** Egypt has a small portion of its land located on mainland Eurasia.

For size and location reference, four very large continental landmasses are also shown.\n\n\n\n\n## Continental landmasses[edit]\n\n\nContinental landmasses are not usually classified as islands despite being completely surrounded by water.[Note 1] However, because the definition of continent varies between geographers, the Americas are sometimes defined as two separate continents while mainland Australia is sometimes defined as an island as well as a continent. Nevertheless, for the purposes of this list, mainland Australia along with the other major landmasses have been listed as continental landmasses for comparison. The figures are approximations and are for the four major continental landmasses only.[Note 2] The artificial Panama and Suez canals are disregarded, as they are not natural waters that separate the continents.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Continental landmass[Note 3] | Area\n | Nation(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| (km2)\n | (sq mi) |\n| 1\n | Afro-Eurasia | 79,810,726[Note 4] | 30,815,094\n |

The United States-based scientific agency considers all landmasses surrounded by ocean water, including continental mainlands, as islands. Under their definition, Africa, Australia, Eurasia, North America, and South America are classified as continental mainland islands.[1]\n2. **^** Physiographically, there are only four continents (including offshore continental islands which sit on the nearby continental shelves) that are completely surrounded by water: Afro-Eurasia (57% of the global land area), the Americas (28.5%), Antarctica (9%), and Australia (5%). The remaining 0.5% is made up of remote oceanic islands, mostly scattered within Oceania in the central and south Pacific Ocean.[2]\n3. **^** Including landmasses which are above water and over 2,500,000 km2 (970,000 sq mi). The submerged continent of Zealandia (approx. 5,000,000 km2 (1,900,000 sq mi)) is excluded.[3]\n4. **^** Figure derived from the Global Islands Explorer website, by adding the areas of mainland Africa (29,370,907 km2 (11,340,171 sq mi)) and mainland Eurasia (50,439,819 km2 (19,474,923 sq mi)).\n5. **^** Egypt has a small portion of its land located on mainland Eurasia. Equatorial Guinea's capital city is located on an island.\n6. **^** Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, and Turkey each have a small portion of their land located on continental Europe. Malaysia has a significant portion of its land located on an island.\n7. **^** Russia has a big portion of its land located on continental Asia. Denmark's capital city is located on an island.\n8. **^** 48 countries on mainland Africa[Note 5] and 78 countries on mainland Eurasia (38 countries on continental Asia[Note 6] and 40 countries on continental Europe[Note 7]).\n9. **^** Abkhazia and South Ossetia are both located south of the Greater Caucasus watershed and thus geographically parts of Asia.\n10. **^** Two states on mainland Africa and five states on mainland Eurasia (three states on continental Asia[Note 9] and two states on continental Europe).\n11. **^** Figure derived from the Global Islands Explorer website, by adding the areas of mainland North America (20,090,075 km2 (7,756,821 sq mi)) and mainland South America (17,609,548 km2 (6,799,084 sq mi)).\n12. **^** Depending on the definition, a significant portion of Panama (land east of the Panama Canal) could be considered a part of mainland South America.\n13. **^** Ten countries on mainland North America[Note 12] and twelve countries on mainland South America.\n14. **^** An overseas department and region of France, located on mainland South America.\n15. **^** Antarctica is a special case, for if its ice is considered not as land, but as water, it is not a single landmass, but several landmasses of much smaller area, since the ice-bedrock boundary is below sea level in many regions of the continent.[4] If its ice cover were to be lifted, some rocks that are currently below sea level would rise as the weight of the ice would be removed,[5] although this would in part be counteracted, and in some areas of the continent overtaken, by eustatic rises in sea level.[6]\n16. **^** Area of mainland Antarctica, without the ice shelves and nearby islands.[7]\n17. **^** All territorial claims in Antarctica are in abeyance under the Antarctic Treaty System.\n18. **^** 7 countries have made 7 territorial claims.[Note 17]\n19. **^** Mainland Australia is more than three times the size of Greenland, the largest island.[8] Australia is sometimes dubbed \"The Island Continent\" or \"Earth's largest island, but its smallest continent\".[9]\n20. **^** Figure derived from the Geoscience Australia website, the area of mainland Tasmania (64,519 km2 (24,911 sq mi)) has been deducted.[10] The Global Islands Explorer website has given a slightly larger figure of 7,618,696 km2 (2,941,595 sq mi) for the area of mainland Australia.\n21. **^** The largest island in the world.\n22. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** A part of the Kingdom of Denmark.\n23. **^** The largest island in the Eastern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere.

Named \"Uunartoq Qeqertaq\" (English: *Warming Island*), this island has always been present off the coast of Greenland, but was covered by a glacier. This glacier was discovered in 2002 to be shrinking rapidly, and by 2007 had completely melted away, leaving the exposed island.[94] The island was named Place of the Year by the Oxford Atlas of the World in 2007.[95] Ben Keene, the atlas's editor, commented: \n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nOutlying territories of European countries\n |\n| --- |\n| Territories under European sovereignty but closer to or on continents other than Europe (see inclusion criteria for further information).\n |\n| Denmark | * Greenland\n* Faroe Islands\n |\n| France | * Clipperton Island\n* French Guiana\n* French Polynesia\n* French Southern and Antarctic Lands\n\t+ Adélie Land\n\t+ Crozet Islands\n\t+ Île Amsterdam\n\t+ Île Saint-Paul\n\t+ Kerguelen Islands\n\t+ Scattered Islands in the Indian Ocean\n* Guadeloupe\n* Martinique\n* Mayotte\n* New Caledonia\n* Réunion\n* Saint Barthélemy\n* Saint Martin\n* Saint Pierre and Miquelon\n* Wallis and Futuna\n |\n| Netherlands | * Aruba\n* Caribbean Netherlands\n\t+ Bonaire\n\t+ Saba\n\t+ Sint Eustatius\n* Curaçao\n* Sint Maarten\n |\n| Norway | * Bouvet Island\n* Peter I Island\n* Queen Maud Land\n* Svalbard\n |\n| Portugal | * Azores\n* Madeira\n |\n| Spain | * Canary Islands\n* Ceuta\n* Melilla\n* Plazas de soberanía\n\t+ Chafarinas Islands\n\t+ Peñón de Alhucemas\n\t+ Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** *Nuna asiilasooq* has equal status as a regional anthem but is generally used only in Greenland.[1]\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Greenlandic has been the sole official language of Greenland since 2009.[2][4]\n3. **^** As of 2000: 410,449 km2 (158,475 sq mi) ice-free; 1,755,637 km2 (677,855 sq mi) ice-covered.  \nDensity: 0.14/km2 (0.36/sq mi) for ice-free areas.\n4. **^** Afro-Eurasia, the Americas, Australia, and Antarctica are all larger than Greenland; but they are generally considered continents, not islands.[15]\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNuuk Airport (GOH)[146] is the second-largest airport, located just 6.0 km (3.7 mi) from the centre of the capital.

As Greenland is one of the Overseas Countries and Territories of the European Union, citizens of Greenland are also granted European Union citizenship.[14] The capital and largest city of Greenland is Nuuk.[14] Greenland lies between the Arctic and Atlantic oceans, east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. It is the world's largest island,[d] as well as the northernmost area of the world – Kaffeklubben Island off the northern coast is the world's northernmost undisputed point of land, and Cape Morris Jesup on the mainland was thought to be so until the 1960s.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n94. **^** McCarthy, Michael (24 April 2007). \"An island made by global warming\". *The Independent*.

Greenland is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Greenland Sea to the east, the North Atlantic Ocean to the southeast, the Davis Strait to the southwest, Baffin Bay to the west, the Nares Strait and Lincoln Sea to the northwest. The nearest countries to Greenland are Canada, with which it shares a maritime border, to the west and southwest across Nares Strait and Baffin Bay, as well as a shared land border on Hans Island;[84] and Iceland, southeast of Greenland in the Atlantic Ocean. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThere is air transport both within Greenland and between the island and other nations. There is also scheduled boat traffic, but the long distances lead to long travel times and low frequency. There are virtually no roads between cities because the coast has many fjords that would require ferry service to connect a road network. The only exception is a gravel road of 4.8 km (3 mi) length between Kangilinnguit and the now abandoned former cryolite mining town of Ivittuut.[142] In addition, the lack of agriculture, forestry and similar countryside activities has meant that very few country roads have been built. Greenland has no passenger railways.\n\n\nKangerlussuaq Airport (SFJ)[143] is the largest airport and the main aviation hub for international passenger transport. It serves international and domestic airline operated flight.[144] SFJ is far from the vicinity of the larger metropolitan capital areas, 317 km (197 mi) to the capital Nuuk, and airline passenger services are available.[145]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Economy | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Bank\n* Companies\n* Krone (currency)\n* Fishing industry\n* Mining\n* National Bank\n* Taxation\n* Telecommunications\n* Tourism\n* Transport\n |\n\n |\n| Society | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Demographics\n\t+ Inuit\n\t+ Inughuit\n\t+ Kalaallit\n\t+ Tunumiit\n\t+ Danes\n\t+ Danish\n* Notable individuals\n\t+ artists\n\t+ Inuit\n* Suicide\n |\n| Culture | * Art\n* Cuisine\n* Hunting\n* Jante Law\n* Mythology\n* Language\n* Music\n* Public holidays\n* Religion\n* Sports\n |\n| Symbols | * Coat of arms\n* Flag\n* National (civic) anthem\n* Royal anthem\n |\n\n |\n| * Outline\n* Index\n\n* Category\n |\n\n| Links to related articles\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nAdministrative divisions of Greenland (since 2018)\n |\n| --- |\n| Municipalities | * Avannaata\n* Kujalleq\n* Qeqertalik\n* Qeqqata\n* Sermersooq\n | ![Greenland](image)\n |\n| Unincorporated Areas | * Pituffik Space Base\n* Northeast Greenland National Park\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The special territories of the European Union (pre 31 January 2020)\n![](image)Nuuk is Greenland's capital and the seat of the government.\nThe Greenlandic government holds executive power in local government affairs.

A survey led by French scientist Paul-Emile Victor in 1951 concluded that, under the ice sheet, Greenland is composed of three large islands.[91] This is disputed, but if it is so, they would be separated by narrow straits, reaching the sea at Ilulissat Icefjord, at Greenland's Grand Canyon and south of Nordostrundingen.\n\n\nAll towns and settlements of Greenland are situated along the ice-free coast, with the population being concentrated along the west coast. The northeastern part of Greenland is not part of any municipality, but it is the site of the world's largest national park, Northeast Greenland National Park.[92]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n81. **^** Stephanie Vermillion (24 March 2021). \"Greenland Is Approaching Tourism Slowly—And Taking Lessons from Iceland, 24 March 2021\".

Most airports, including Nuuk Airport, have short runways and can only be served by special fairly small aircraft on fairly short flights. Kangerlussuaq Airport, which is around 100 km (62 mi) inland from the west coast, is the major airport of Greenland and the hub for domestic flights. Intercontinental flights connect mainly to Copenhagen.

After finding a habitable area and settling there, he named it *Grœnland* (translated as \"Greenland\"), supposedly in the hope that the pleasant name would attract settlers.[24][25][26] The *Saga of Erik the Red* states: \"In the summer, Erik left to settle in the country he had found, which he called Greenland, as he said people would be attracted there if it had a favorable name.\"[27]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 7.5% Danish\n* 1.1% other Nordic\n* 1.9% Others\n |\n| Religion  | Christianity (Church of Greenland) |\n| Demonym(s) | * Greenlander\n* Greenlandic\n |\n| Government | Devolved government within a parliamentary constitutional monarchy |\n|  |\n| • Monarch\n | Margrethe II |\n| • High Commissioner\n | Julie Præst Wilche |\n| • Premier\n | Múte Bourup Egede |\n| • Speaker of the Inatsisartut\n | Mimi Karlsen |\n|  |\n| Legislature | Inatsisartut |\n| National representation |\n| • Folketing\n | 2 members |\n| Area |\n| • Total\n | 2,166,086 km2 (836,330 sq mi) |\n| • Water (%)\n | 83.1[c] |\n| Highest elevation | 3,700 m (12,100 ft) |\n| Population |\n| • 2022 estimate\n | ![Neutral increase](image)56,583[7] (210th) |\n| • Density\n | 0.028/km2 (0.1/sq mi) |\n| GDP (PPP) | 2011 estimate |\n| • Total\n | $1.8 billion[8] |\n| • Per capita\n | $37,000 |\n| GDP (nominal) | 2019 estimate |\n| • Total\n | $3.0 billion[9] |\n| • Per capita\n | $53,000[10] |\n| Gini (2015) | ![Steady](image) 33.9[11]medium |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n153. **^** Woodman, Georg (18 October 2017). *2033-The Century After: How the World Would Look/Be If Nazi Germany & Empire Japan Had Won World War II*.

According to a 2010 census, Greenland holds the highest suicide rate in the world.[173][174] Another significant social issue faced by Greenland is a high rate of alcoholism.[175] Alcohol consumption rates in Greenland reached their height in the 1980s, when it was twice as high as in Denmark, and had by 2010 fallen slightly below the average level of consumption in Denmark (which at the time were 12th highest in the world, but has since fallen). However, at the same time, alcohol prices are far higher, meaning that consumption has a large social impact.[176][177] Prevalence of HIV/AIDS used to be high in Greenland and peaked in the 1990s when the fatality rate also was relatively high. Through a number of initiatives the prevalence (along with the fatality rate through efficient treatment) has fallen and is now low, c. 0.13%,[178][179] below most other countries. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n48. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Ingstad, Helge; Stine Ingstad, Anne (2000). *The Viking Discovery of America: The Excavation of a Norse Settlement in L'Anse Aux Meadows, Newfoundland*.

There is also scheduled boat traffic, but the long distances lead to long travel times and low frequency.

The only exception is a gravel road of 4.8 km (3 mi) length between Kangilinnguit and the now abandoned former cryolite mining town of Ivittuut.[142] In addition, the lack of agriculture, forestry and similar countryside activities has meant that very few country roads have been built.

It serves international and domestic airline operated flight.[144] SFJ is far from the vicinity of the larger metropolitan capital areas, 317 km (197 mi) to the capital Nuuk, and airline passenger services are available.[145]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Economy | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Bank\n* Companies\n* Krone (currency)\n* Fishing industry\n* Mining\n* National Bank\n* Taxation\n* Telecommunications\n* Tourism\n* Transport\n |\n\n |\n| Society | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Demographics\n\t+ Inuit\n\t+ Inughuit\n\t+ Kalaallit\n\t+ Tunumiit\n\t+ Danes\n\t+ Danish\n* Notable individuals\n\t+ artists\n\t+ Inuit\n* Suicide\n |\n| Culture | * Art\n* Cuisine\n* Hunting\n* Jante Law\n* Mythology\n* Language\n* Music\n* Public holidays\n* Religion\n* Sports\n |\n| Symbols | * Coat of arms\n* Flag\n* National (civic) anthem\n* Royal anthem\n |\n\n |\n| * Outline\n* Index\n\n* Category\n |\n\n| Links to related articles\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nAdministrative divisions of Greenland (since 2018)\n |\n| --- |\n| Municipalities | * Avannaata\n* Kujalleq\n* Qeqertalik\n* Qeqqata\n* Sermersooq\n | ![Greenland](image)\n |\n| Unincorporated Areas | * Pituffik Space Base\n* Northeast Greenland National Park\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The special territories of the European Union (pre 31 January 2020)\n![](image)Nuuk is Greenland's capital and the seat of the government.\nThe Greenlandic government holds executive power in local government affairs.

According to a 2010 census, Greenland holds the highest suicide rate in the world.[173][174] Another significant social issue faced by Greenland is a high rate of alcoholism.[175] Alcohol consumption rates in Greenland reached their height in the 1980s, when it was twice as high as in Denmark, and had by 2010 fallen slightly below the average level of consumption in Denmark (which at the time were 12th highest in the world, but has since fallen). However, at the same time, alcohol prices are far higher, meaning that consumption has a large social impact.[176][177] Prevalence of HIV/AIDS used to be high in Greenland and peaked in the 1990s when the fatality rate also was relatively high. Through a number of initiatives the prevalence (along with the fatality rate through efficient treatment) has fallen and is now low, c. 0.13%,[178][179] below most other countries. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n48. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Ingstad, Helge; Stine Ingstad, Anne (2000). *The Viking Discovery of America: The Excavation of a Norse Settlement in L'Anse Aux Meadows, Newfoundland*.

Located in Melanesia in the southwestern Pacific Ocean, the island is separated from Australia by the 150-kilometre (81-nautical-mile; 93-mile) wide Torres Strait, though both landmasses lie on the same continental shelf. Numerous smaller islands are located to the west and east. The name \"New Guinea\" was given by Spanish explorer Yñigo Ortiz de Retez during his maritime expedition of 1545 due to the resemblance of the indigenous peoples of the island to those in the African region of Guinea.[1]\n\n\nThe eastern half of the island is the major land mass of the independent state of Papua New Guinea. The western half, known as Western New Guinea,[2] forms a part of Indonesia and is organized as the provinces of Papua, Central Papua, Highland Papua, South Papua, Southwest Papua, and West Papua. The largest cities on the island are Jayapura (capital of Papua, Indonesia) and Port Moresby (capital of Papua New Guinea).\n\n\n\n\n## Names[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A 1644 map of New Guinea and the surrounding area\nThe island has been known by various names:\n\n\nThe name *Papua* was used to refer to parts of the island before contact with the West.[3] Its etymology is unclear;[3] one theory states that it derived from Tidore, the language used by the Sultanate of Tidore.[1] An expedition by the Sultan of Tidore, together with Sahmardan, the *Sangaji* of Patani, and the Papuan Gurabesi, managed to conquer some areas in New Guinea, which was then reorganised to form *Korano Ngaruha* (\"Four Kings\") or Raja Ampat, *Papoua Gam Sio* (lit. \"The Papua Nine *Negeri*\"), and *Mafor Soa Raha* (lit. The Mafor \"Four *Soa*\"). The name comes from the words *papo* (\"to unite\") and *ua* (negation), which means \"not united\", i.e. an outlying possession of Tidore.[1][4][5]\n\n\nAnton Ploeg reports that the word *papua* is often said to be derived from the Malay word *papua* or *pua-pua*, meaning \"frizzly-haired\", referring to the very curly hair of the island's inhabitants.[6] However Sollewijn Gelpke in 1993 considered this unlikely as it had been used earlier, and he instead derived it from the Biak phrase *sup i babwa*, which means \"the land below [the sunset]\", and refers to the Raja Ampat Islands. \n\n\nWhen Portuguese and Spanish explorers arrived via the Spice Islands, they also used the name *Papua*.[1][7] However, Westerners, beginning with Spanish explorer Yñigo Ortiz de Retez in 1545, used the name *New Guinea*, due to the resemblance between the indigenous peoples of the island and Africans of the Guinea region.[1] The name is one of several toponyms sharing similar etymologies, ultimately meaning \"land of the blacks\" or similar meanings.\n\n\nThe Dutch, who arrived later under Jacob Le Maire and Willem Schouten, called it *Schouten island*. They later used this name only to refer to islands off the north coast of Papua proper, the Schouten Islands or Biak Island. When the Dutch colonized the main island as part of the Dutch East Indies, they called it *Nieuw Guinea*.[1]\n\n\nThe name *Irian* was used in the Indonesian language to refer to the island and Indonesian province, as *Irian Barat* (West Irian) Province and later *Irian Jaya* Province. The name Irian was suggested during a tribal committee meeting in Tobati, Jayapura, formed by Soegoro Atmoprasodjo under governor JP van Eechoed, to decide on a new name because of the negative association of *Papua*. Frans Kaisiepo, the committee leader, suggested the name from Mansren Koreri myths, *Iri-an* from the Biak language of Biak Island, meaning \"hot land\" (referring to the climate), but also from *Iryan* which means heated process as a metaphor for a land that is entering a new era. In Serui *Iri-an* (lit. \"land-nation\") means \"pillar of nation\", while in Merauke *Iri-an* (lit. \"placed higher-nation\") means \"rising spirit\" or \"to rise\".[5][8] The name was promoted in 1945 by Marcus Kaisiepo, brother of Frans Kaisiepo.[3] The name was politicized later by Corinus Krey,[9] Marthen Indey, Silas Papare, and others with the Indonesian backronym *Ikut Republik Indonesia Anti Nederland* (\"Join the Republic of Indonesia Oppose the Netherlands\").[10][5] *Irian* was used somewhat in 1972.[11] The name was used until 2001, when *Papua* was again used for the island and the province. The name *Irian*, which was originally favored by natives, is now considered to be a name imposed by the authority of Jakarta.[3]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Regions of Oceania: Australasia, Polynesia, Micronesia, and Melanesia. Physiographically, Australasia includes the Australian landmass (including Tasmania), New Zealand, and New Guinea\n![](image)New Guinea located in relation to Melanesia\n![](image)New Guinea map of Köppen climate classificationSee also: List of highest mountains of New Guinea\n\nNew Guinea is an island to the north of the Australian mainland, south of the equator. It is isolated by the Arafura Sea to the west, and the Torres Strait and Coral Sea to the east. Sometimes considered to be the easternmost island of the Indonesian archipelago, it lies north of Australia's Top End, the Gulf of Carpentaria and Cape York Peninsula, and west of the Bismarck Archipelago and the Solomon Islands archipelago.\n\n\nPolitically, the western half of the island comprises six provinces of Indonesia: Papua, Central Papua, Highland Papua, South Papua, West Papua and Southwest Papua. The eastern half forms the mainland of the country of Papua New Guinea.\n\n\n\n![](image)Topographical map of New Guinea The shape of New Guinea is often compared to that of a bird-of-paradise (indigenous to the island), and this results in the usual names for the two extremes of the island: the Bird's Head Peninsula in the northwest (*Vogelkop* in Dutch, *Kepala Burung* in Indonesian; also known as the Doberai Peninsula), and the Bird's Tail Peninsula in the southeast (also known as the Papuan Peninsula).\n\n\nA spine of east–west mountains, the New Guinea Highlands, dominates the geography of New Guinea, stretching over 1,600 km (1,000 mi) across the island, with many mountains over 4,000 m (13,100 ft). The western half of the island contains the highest mountains in Oceania, with its highest point, Puncak Jaya, reaching an elevation of 4,884 m (16,023 ft). The tree line is around 4,000 m (13,100 ft) elevation, and the tallest peaks contain equatorial glaciers—which have been retreating since at least 1936.[12][13][14] Various other smaller mountain ranges occur both north and west of the central ranges. Except in high elevations, most areas possess a warm humid climate throughout the year, with some seasonal variation associated with the northeast monsoon season.\n\n\n\n![](image)Mount Bosavi\nAnother major habitat feature is the vast southern and northern lowlands. Stretching for hundreds of kilometres, these include lowland rainforests, extensive wetlands, savanna grasslands, and some of the largest expanses of mangrove forest in the world. The southern lowlands are the site of Lorentz National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The northern lowlands are drained principally by the Mamberamo River and its tributaries on the western side, and by the Sepik on the eastern side. The more extensive southern lowlands are drained by a larger number of rivers, principally the Digul in the west and the Fly in the east. The largest island offshore, Dolak, lies near the Digul estuary, separated by a strait so narrow it has been named a \"creek\".\n\n\nNew Guinea contains many of the world's ecosystem types: glacial, alpine tundra, savanna, montane and lowland rainforest, mangroves, wetlands, lake and river ecosystems, seagrasses, and some of the richest coral reefs on the planet.\n\n\nThe entire length of the New Guinea Highlands system passes through New Guinea as a vast watershed. The northern rivers flow into the Pacific Ocean, the southern rivers into the Arafura Sea and the Gulf of Papua. On the north side, the largest rivers are the Mamberamo, Sepik and Ramu.\nMamberamo was born from the confluence of two large inland rivers. Tariku comes from the west to the east and Taritatu from the east. These rivers meander through swamps with huge internal descents and then merge. The Mamberamo thus formed reaches the ocean by breaking through the Coastal Mountains. Mamberamo River is navigable to Marine Falls. The Sepik is a much more important river. Similarly, it collects water from a spacious pool. It is 1,100 kilometers from the Victor Emanuel Range to the estuary, making it the longest river in New Guinea. The winding, muddy, sluggish river can be navigated for 500 km. Ramu is a 650 km long river. Its lower section is navigable, but its upper flow is high-falling, fast-flowing. The energy of the river is used by a power plant near the city of Kainantu.\n\n\nOn the south side, the most significant rivers are Pulau, Digul, Fly, Kikori and Purari. The largest river in the western part of the island is Digul. It originates from the Star Mountains, which rise to an altitude of 4,700 m. The coastal plain is bordered by a swamp world hundreds of kilometers wide. Digul is the main transport route to the fertile hills and mountains within the island. The river Fly is born near the eastern branches of the Digul. It is named after one of the ships of the English Royal Fleet, which first sailed into the mouth of the river in 1845. The total length of the river is 1,050 km. Smaller boats can sail 900 km on the river. The estuary section, which decomposes into islands, is 70 km wide. The tide of the sea can have an effect of up to 300 kilometers. Strickland, a tributary of the Fly, reaches the Papuan Plain through wild gorges. Fly and Strickland together form the largest river in New Guinea. The many rivers flowing into the Gulf of Papua form a single delta complex. The rivers of the island are extremely rich in water due to the annual rainfall of 2,000–10,000 mm. According to a modest calculation, the New Guinea River carries about 1,500 km3/a (48,000 m3/s) of water into the sea. Fly alone carries more water 238 km3/a (7,500 m3/s) than all the rivers in Australia combined.[15]\n\n\n\n## Relation to surroundings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Highlands of Papua New Guinea\nThe island of New Guinea lies to the east of the Malay Archipelago, with which it is sometimes included as part of a greater Indo-Australian Archipelago.[16] Geologically it is a part of the same tectonic plate as Australia. When world sea levels were low, the two shared shorelines (which now lie 100 to 140 metres below sea level),[17] and combined with lands now inundated into the tectonic continent of Sahul,[18][19] also known as Greater Australia.[20] The two landmasses became separated when the area now known as the Torres Strait flooded after the end of the last glacial period.\n\n\nAnthropologically, New Guinea is considered part of Melanesia.[21]\n\n\nNew Guinea is differentiated from its drier, flatter,[22] and less fertile[23][24] southern counterpart, Australia, by its much higher rainfall and its active volcanic geology. Yet the two land masses share a similar animal fauna, with marsupials, including wallabies and possums, and the egg-laying monotreme, the echidna. Other than bats and some two dozen indigenous rodent genera,[25] there are no pre-human indigenous placental mammals. Pigs, several additional species of rats, and the ancestor of the New Guinea singing dog were introduced with human colonization.\n\n\nPrior to the 1970s, archaeologists called the single Pleistocene landmass by the name *Australasia*,[18] although this word is most often used for a wider region that includes lands, such as New Zealand, which are not on the same continental shelf. In the early 1970s, they introduced the term *Greater Australia* for the Pleistocene continent.[18] Then, at a 1975 conference and consequent publication,[19] they extended the name *Sahul* from its previous use for just the Sahul Shelf to cover the continent.[18]\n\n\n\n## Political divisions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Political divisions of New Guinea\n![](image)Papua province\n Highland Papua province\n Central Papua province\n South Papua province\n West Papua province, which was divided in December 2022[26]\n\nThe island of New Guinea is divided politically into roughly equal halves across a north–south line:\n\n\n\n* The western portion of the island located west of 141°E longitude (except for a small section of territory to the east of the Fly River which belongs to Papua New Guinea) was formerly a Dutch colony, part of the Dutch East Indies. After the West New Guinea dispute it is now six Indonesian provinces:\n\t+ West Papua with Manokwari as its capital.\n\t+ Papua with the city of Jayapura as its capital.\n\t+ Highland Papua with Jayawijaya Regency as its capital.\n\t+ Central Papua with Nabire Regency as its capital.\n\t+ South Papua with Merauke Regency as its capital.\n\t+ Southwest Papua with Sorong as its capital\n* The eastern part forms the mainland of Papua New Guinea, which has been an independent country since 1975. It was formerly the Territory of Papua and New Guinea governed by Australia, consisting of the Trust Territory of New Guinea (northeastern quarter, formerly German New Guinea), and the Territory of Papua (southeastern quarter). Three of Papua New Guinea's four regions are parts of New Guinea island:\n\t+ Southern, consisting of Western, Gulf, Central, Oro (Northern) and Milne Bay provinces.\n\t+ Highlands, consisting of Southern Highlands, Hela Province, Jiwaka Province, Enga Province, Western Highlands, Simbu and Eastern Highlands provinces.\n\t+ Momase, consisting of Morobe, Madang, East Sepik and Sandaun (West Sepik) provinces.\n\n\n## People[edit]\n\n\nSee also: People of New Guinea\n\n![](image)Yali tribesman in the Baliem Valley\nThe current population of the island of New Guinea is about fifteen million. Archaeological evidence indicates that humans may have inhabited the island continuously since 50,000 BCE,[27][28] and first settlement possibly dating back to 60,000 years ago has been proposed. The island is presently populated by almost a thousand different tribal groups and a near-equivalent number of separate languages, which makes New Guinea the most linguistically diverse area in the world. Ethnologue's 14th edition lists 826 languages of Papua New Guinea and 257 languages of Western New Guinea, total 1073 languages, with 12 languages overlapping.[*clarification needed*] They can be divided into two groups, the Austronesian languages, and all the others placed in the catch-all category of Papuan languages, most of which are unrelated.[29]\n\n\nThe separation is not merely linguistic; warfare among societies was a factor in the evolution of the *men's house*: separate housing for groups of adult men, away from the single-family houses of women and children.[*citation needed*] Pig-based trade between groups and pig-based feasts form a common tradition with the other peoples of southeast Asia and Oceania. Most Papuan societies practice agriculture, supplemented by hunting and gathering.\n\n\n\n![](image)Yali Mabel, Kurulu Village War Chief at Baliem Valley\nCurrent evidence indicates that the Papuans (who constitute the majority of the island's peoples) are descended from the earliest human inhabitants of New Guinea. These original inhabitants first arrived in New Guinea at a time around the Last Glacial Maximum (c. 21,000 years ago) when the island was connected to the Australian continent via a land bridge, forming the landmass of Sahul. These peoples had made the (shortened) sea-crossing from the islands of Wallacea and Sundaland (the present Malay Archipelago) by at least 40,000 years ago.\n\n\n\n![](image)Korowai tribesman\nThe ancestral Austronesian peoples are believed to have arrived considerably later, approximately 3,500 years ago, as part of a gradual seafaring migration from Southeast Asia, possibly originating in Taiwan. Austronesian-speaking peoples colonized many of the offshore islands to the north and east of New Guinea, such as New Ireland and New Britain, with settlements also on the coastal fringes of the main island in places. Human habitation of New Guinea over tens of thousands of years has led to a great deal of diversity, which was further increased by the later arrival of the Austronesians and the more recent history of European and Asian settlement through events like transmigration. \n\n\nLarge areas of New Guinea are yet to be explored by scientists and anthropologists. The Indonesian province of West Papua is home to an estimated 44 uncontacted tribal groups.[30]\n\n\n\n## Biodiversity and ecology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Fauna of New Guinea\n\nWith some 786,000 km2 of tropical land—less than one-half of one percent (0.5%) of the Earth's surface—New Guinea has an immense biodiversity, containing between 5 and 10 percent of the total species on the planet. This percentage is about the same amount as that found in the United States or Australia. A high percentage of New Guinea's species are endemic, and thousands are still unknown to science: probably well over 200,000 species of insect, between 11,000 and 20,000 plant species, and over 650 resident bird species. Most of these species are shared, at least in their origin, with the continent of Australia, which was until fairly recent geological times part of the same landmass (see Australia-New Guinea for an overview). The island is so large that it is considered 'nearly a continent' in terms of its biological distinctiveness.\n\n\nIn the period from 1998 to 2008, conservationists identified 1,060 new species in New Guinea, including 218 plants, 43 reptiles, 12 mammals, 580 invertebrates, 134 amphibians, 2 birds and 71 fish.[31] Between 2011 and 2017, researchers described 465 previously undocumented plant species in New Guinea.[32] As of 2019, the Indonesian portion of New Guinea and the Maluku Islands is estimated to have 9,518 species of vascular plants, of which 4,380 are endemic. In 2020, an international study conducted by a team of 99 experts cataloged 13,634 species representing 1,742 genera and 264 families of vascular plants for New Guinea and its associated islands (Aru Islands, Bismarck Archipelago, D'Entrecasteaux Islands, Louisiade Archipelago), making it the world's most floristically diverse island, surpassing Madagascar (11,488), Borneo (11,165), Java (4,598), and the Philippines (9,432).[33]\n\n\n\n![](image)The raggiana bird-of-paradise is native to New Guinea.\n![](image)The floristic region of Malesia\nBiogeographically, New Guinea is part of Australasia rather than the Indomalayan realm, although New Guinea's flora has many more affinities with Asia than its fauna, which is overwhelmingly Australian. Botanically, New Guinea is considered part of Malesia, a floristic region that extends from the Malay Peninsula across Indonesia to New Guinea and the East Melanesian Islands. The flora of New Guinea is a mixture of many tropical rainforest species with origins in Asia, together with typically Australasian flora. Typical Southern Hemisphere flora include the conifers *Podocarpus* and the rainforest emergents *Araucaria* and *Agathis,* as well as tree ferns and several species of *Eucalyptus*.\n\n\nNew Guinea has 284 species and six orders of mammals: monotremes, three orders of marsupials, rodents and bats; 195 of the mammal species (69%) are endemic. New Guinea has 578 species of breeding birds, of which 324 species are endemic. The island's frogs are one of the most poorly known vertebrate groups, totalling 282 species, but this number is expected to double or even triple when all species have been documented. New Guinea has a rich diversity of coral life and 1,200 species of fish have been found. Also about 600 species of reef-building coral—the latter equal to 75 percent of the world's known total. The entire coral area covers 18 million hectares off a peninsula in northwest New Guinea.\n\n\n\n![](image)New Guinea crocodile\nAs of 2020, the Western portion of New Guinea, Papua and West Papua, accounts for 54% of the island's primary forest and about 51% of the island's total tree cover, according to satellite data.[34]\n\n\n\n### Ecoregions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ecoregions of New Guinea\n\n#### Terrestrial[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the WWF, New Guinea can be divided into twelve terrestrial ecoregions:[35]\n\n\n\n* Central Range montane rain forests\n* Central Range sub-alpine grasslands\n* Huon Peninsula montane rain forests\n* New Guinea mangroves\n* Northern New Guinea lowland rain and freshwater swamp forests\n* Northern New Guinea montane rain forests\n* Southeastern Papuan rain forests\n* Southern New Guinea freshwater swamp forests\n* Southern New Guinea lowland rain forests\n* Trans-Fly savanna and grasslands\n* Vogelkop montane rain forests\n* Vogelkop-Aru lowland rain forests\n\n\n![](image)Coral reefs in Papua New Guinea\n#### Freshwater[edit]\n\n\nThe WWF and Nature Conservancy divide New Guinea into five freshwater ecoregions:[36]\n\n\n\n* Vogelkop–Bomberai\n* New Guinea North Coast\n* New Guinea Central Mountains\n* Southwest New Guinea–Trans-Fly Lowland\n* Papuan Peninsula\n\n\n#### Marine[edit]\n\n\nThe WWF and Nature Conservancy identify several marine ecoregions in the seas bordering New Guinea:[37]\n\n\n\n* Papua\n* Bismarck Sea\n* Solomon Sea\n* Southeast Papua New Guinea\n* Gulf of Papua\n* Arafura Sea\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: History of Papua New Guinea and History of Western New Guinea\n\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The continent of Sahul before the rising ocean sundered Australia and New Guinea after the last ice age\nThe first inhabitants Indigenous people of New Guinea, from whom the Papuan people are probably descended, adapted to the range of ecologies and, in time, developed one of the earliest known agricultures. Remains of this agricultural system, in the form of ancient irrigation systems in the highlands of Papua New Guinea, are being studied by archaeologists. Research indicates that the highlands were an early and independent center of agriculture, with evidence of irrigation going back at least 10,000 years.[38] Sugarcane was cultivated in New Guinea around 6000 BCE.[39]\n\n\nThe gardens of the New Guinea Highlands are ancient, intensive permacultures, adapted to high population densities, very high rainfalls (as high as 10,000 mm per year (400 in/yr)), earthquakes, hilly land, and occasional frost. Complex mulches, crop rotations and tillages are used in rotation on terraces with complex irrigation systems. Western agronomists still do not understand all of the practices, and it has been noted that native gardeners are as, or even more, successful than most scientific farmers in raising certain crops.[40] There is evidence that New Guinea gardeners invented crop rotation well before western Europeans.[41] A unique feature of New Guinea permaculture is the silviculture of *Casuarina oligodon*, a tall, sturdy native ironwood tree, suited to use for timber and fuel, with root nodules that fix nitrogen. Pollen studies show that it was adopted during an ancient period of extreme deforestation.\n\n\nIn more recent millennia, another wave of people arrived on the shores of New Guinea. These were the Austronesian people, who had spread down from Taiwan, through the South-east Asian archipelago, colonising many of the islands on the way. The Austronesian people had technology and skills extremely well adapted to ocean voyaging and Austronesian language speaking people are present along much of the coastal areas and islands of New Guinea. They also introduced pigs and dogs. These Austronesian migrants are considered the ancestors of most people in insular Southeast Asia, from Sumatra and Java to Borneo and Sulawesi, as well as coastal new Guinea.[42]\n\n\n\n### Precolonial history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Group of natives at Mairy Pass. Mainland of British New Guinea in 1885.\n![](image)Papuans on the Lorentz River, photographed during the third South New Guinea expedition in 1912–13\nThe western part of the island was in contact with kingdoms in other parts of modern-day Indonesia. The *Negarakertagama* mentioned the region of Wanin and Sran, in eastern Nusantara as part of Majapahit's tributary. This 'Wanin' has been identified with the Onin Peninsula, part of the Bomberai Peninsula near the city of Fakfak.[43][44], while 'Sran' had been identified as region of Kowiai, just south of Onin peninsula.[5] The sultans of Tidore, in the Maluku Islands, claimed sovereignty over various coastal parts of the island.[45] During Tidore's rule, the main exports of the island during this period were resins, spices, slaves and the highly priced feathers of the bird-of-paradise. In a period of constant conflict called 'hongi wars', in which rival villages or kingdoms would invoke the name of Tidore Sultan, rightly, for punitive expeditions for not fulfilling their tributary obligations, or opportunitively for competitions over resources and prestige.[45] Sultan Nuku, one of the most famous Tidore sultans who rebelled against Dutch colonization, called himself \"Sultan of Tidore and Papua\",[46] during his revolt in 1780s. He commanded loyalty from both Moluccan and Papuan chiefs, especially those of Raja Ampat Islands, from his base in Gebe. Following Tidore's subjugation as Dutch tributary, much of the territory it claimed in western part of New Guinea came under Dutch rule as part of Dutch East Indies.[46]\n\n\n\n### European contact[edit]\n\n\nThe first European contact with New Guinea was by Portuguese and Spanish sailors in the 16th century. In 1526–27, Portuguese explorer Jorge de Meneses saw the western tip of New Guinea and named it *ilhas dos Papuas*. In 1528, the Spanish navigator Álvaro de Saavedra also recorded its sighting when trying to return from Tidore to New Spain. In 1545, Spaniard Íñigo Ortíz de Retes sailed along the north coast of New Guinea as far as the Mamberamo River, near which he landed on 20 June, naming the island 'Nueva Guinea'.[47] The first map showing the whole island (as an island) was published in 1600[*citation needed*] and shows it as 'Nova Guinea'. In 1606, Luís Vaz de Torres explored the southern coast of New Guinea from Milne Bay to the Gulf of Papua including Orangerie Bay, which he named *Bahía de San Lorenzo*. His expedition also discovered Basilaki Island naming it *Tierra de San Buenaventura*, which he claimed for Spain in July 1606.[48] On 18 October, his expedition reached the western part of the island in present-day Indonesia, and also claimed the territory for the King of Spain.\n\n\n\n![](image)New Guinea from 1884 to 1919. The Netherlands controlled the western half of New Guinea, Germany the north-eastern part, and Britain the south-eastern part.\nA successive European claim occurred in 1828, when the Netherlands formally claimed the western half of the island as Netherlands New Guinea. Dutch colonial authority built Fort Du Bus an administrative and trading post established near Lobo, Triton Bay, but by 1835 had been abandoned.[49] Considering that New Guinea had little economic value for them, the Dutch promoted Tidore as suzerain of Papua. By 1849, Tidore's borders had been extended to the proximity of the current international border between Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, as it formed extensive trade pact and custom of *Uli-Siwa* ( federation of nine ).[50]\n\n\nIn 1883, following a short-lived French annexation of New Ireland, the British colony of Queensland annexed south-eastern New Guinea. However, the Queensland government's superiors in the United Kingdom revoked the claim, and (formally) assumed direct responsibility in 1884, when Germany claimed north-eastern New Guinea as the protectorate of German New Guinea (also called Kaiser-Wilhelmsland).\n\n\nThe first Dutch government posts were established in 1898 and in 1902: Manokwari on the north coast, Fak-Fak in the west and Merauke in the south at the border with British New Guinea. The German, Dutch and British colonial administrators each attempted to suppress the still-widespread practices of inter-village warfare and headhunting within their respective territories.[51]\n\n\nIn 1905, the British government transferred some administrative responsibility over southeast New Guinea to Australia (which renamed the area \"Territory of Papua\"); and, in 1906, transferred all remaining responsibility to Australia. During World War I, Australian forces seized German New Guinea, which in 1920 became the Territory of New Guinea, to be administered by Australia under a League of Nations mandate. The territories under Australian administration became collectively known as The Territories of Papua and New Guinea (until February 1942).\n\n\nBefore about 1930, European maps showed the highlands as uninhabited forests.[52] When first flown over by aircraft, numerous settlements with agricultural terraces and stockades were observed. The most startling discovery took place on 4 August 1938, when Richard Archbold discovered the Grand Valley of the Baliem River, which had 50,000 yet-undiscovered Stone Age farmers living in orderly villages. The people, known as the Dani, were the last society of its size to make first contact with the rest of the world.[53] A 1930 expedition led by the prospector Michael Lehay also encountered an indigenous group in the highlands. The inhabitants, believing themselves to be the only people in the world and, having never seen Europeans before, initially believed the explorers to be spirits of the dead due to the local belief that a person's skin turned white when they died and crossed into the land of the dead.[54]\n\n\n\n![](image)A Japanese military map of New Guinea from 1943\n### World War II[edit]\n\n\nMain article: New Guinea campaign\n\n![](image)Australian soldiers resting in the Finisterre Ranges of New Guinea while en route to the front line\nNetherlands New Guinea and the Australian territories (the eastern half ) were invaded in 1942 by the Japanese. The Netherlands were defeated by that stage and did not put up a fight, and the western section was not of any strategic value to either side, they did not battle there. The Japanese invaded the north shore of the Australia territories and were aiming to move south and take the southern shore too. The highlands, northern and eastern parts of the island became key battlefields in the South West Pacific Theatre of World War II. Notable battles were for Port Moresby ( the naval battle is known as the Battle of the Coral Sea), Milne Bay and for the Kakoda track. Papuans often gave vital assistance to the Allies, fighting alongside Australian troops, and carrying equipment and injured men across New Guinea. Approximately 216,000 Japanese, Australian and U.S. soldiers, sailors and airmen died during the New Guinea Campaign.[55]\n\n\n\n### Since World War II[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Papua conflict\n\nFollowing the return to civil administration after World War II, the Australian section was known as the Territory of Papua-New Guinea from 1945 to 1949 and then as Territory of Papua and New Guinea. Although the rest of the Dutch East Indies achieved independence as Indonesia on 27 December 1949, the Netherlands regained control of western New Guinea.\n\n\n\n![](image)Map of New Guinea, with place names as used in English in the 1940s\nDuring the 1950s, the Dutch government began to prepare Netherlands New Guinea for full independence and allowed elections in 1959; the partial elected New Guinea Council took office on 5 April 1961. The Council decided on the name of West Papua (*Papua Barat*) for the territory, along with an emblem, flag, and anthem to complement those of the Netherlands. On 1 October 1962, after some military interventions and negotiations, the Dutch handed over the territory to the United Nations Temporary Executive Authority, until 1 May 1963, when Indonesia took control. The territory was renamed West Irian (*Irian Barat*) and then Irian Jaya. In 1969, Indonesia, under the 1962 New York Agreement, organised a referendum named the Act of Free Choice, in which the military hand picked Papuan tribal elders to vote for integration with Indonesia.[56][57]\n\n\nThere has been significant reported resistance to Indonesian integration and occupation,[58] both through civil disobedience (such as publicly raising the Morning Star flag) and via the formation of the Organisasi Papua Merdeka (OPM, or Free Papua Movement) in 1965.[59] Amnesty International has estimated more than 100,000 Papuans, one-sixth of the population, have died as a result of government-sponsored violence against West Papuans.[60] Reports published by TRT World and De Gruyter Oldenbourg have put the number of killed Papuans since the start of the conflict at roughly 500,000.[61][62]\n\n\n\n![](image)Western New Guinea was formally annexed by Indonesia in 1969.\nFrom 1971, the name Papua New Guinea was used for the Australian territory. On 16 September 1975, Australia granted full independence to Papua New Guinea. In 2000, Irian Jaya was formally renamed \"The Province of Papua\" and a Law on Special Autonomy was passed in 2001. The Law established a Papuan People's Assembly (MRP) with representatives of the different indigenous cultures of Papua. The MRP was empowered to protect the rights of Papuans, raise the status of women in Papua, and to ease religious tensions in Papua; block grants were given for the implementation of the Law as much as $266 million in 2004.[63] The Indonesian courts' enforcement of the Law on Special Autonomy blocked further creation of subdivisions of Papua: although President Megawati Sukarnoputri was able to create a separate West Papua province in 2003 as a fait accompli, plans for a third province on western New Guinea were blocked by the courts.[64] Critics argue that the Indonesian government has been reluctant to establish or issue various government implementing regulations so that the legal provisions of special autonomy could be put into practice, and as a result special autonomy in Papua has \"failed\".[65][66]\n\n\nIn 2022, the Indonesian Government split Papuan Province into four provinces. In addition to Papua Province proper (capital Jayapura), the three new provinces are South Papua (capital Merauke), Central Papua (capital Nabire) and Highland Papua (capital Wamena).[67]\n\n\nThe culture of inter-tribal warfare and animosity between the neighboring tribes are still present in New Guinea.[68]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The alternative name *Nugini* is generally only used as part of the country name of Papua New Guinea, *Papua Nugini*, and of the names of the historical territories of Dutch New Guinea (*Nugini Belanda*), German New Guinea (*Nugini Jerman*), and Territory of New Guinea (*Teritori Nugini*). Thus, *Nugini* is effectively a fossil word.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** Bilveer Singh (2008). *Papua: geopolitics and the quest for nationhood*.

Located in Melanesia in the southwestern Pacific Ocean, the island is separated from Australia by the 150-kilometre (81-nautical-mile; 93-mile) wide Torres Strait, though both landmasses lie on the same continental shelf. Numerous smaller islands are located to the west and east. The name \"New Guinea\" was given by Spanish explorer Yñigo Ortiz de Retez during his maritime expedition of 1545 due to the resemblance of the indigenous peoples of the island to those in the African region of Guinea.[1]\n\n\nThe eastern half of the island is the major land mass of the independent state of Papua New Guinea. The western half, known as Western New Guinea,[2] forms a part of Indonesia and is organized as the provinces of Papua, Central Papua, Highland Papua, South Papua, Southwest Papua, and West Papua. The largest cities on the island are Jayapura (capital of Papua, Indonesia) and Port Moresby (capital of Papua New Guinea).\n\n\n\n\n## Names[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A 1644 map of New Guinea and the surrounding area\nThe island has been known by various names:\n\n\nThe name *Papua* was used to refer to parts of the island before contact with the West.[3] Its etymology is unclear;[3] one theory states that it derived from Tidore, the language used by the Sultanate of Tidore.[1] An expedition by the Sultan of Tidore, together with Sahmardan, the *Sangaji* of Patani, and the Papuan Gurabesi, managed to conquer some areas in New Guinea, which was then reorganised to form *Korano Ngaruha* (\"Four Kings\") or Raja Ampat, *Papoua Gam Sio* (lit. \"The Papua Nine *Negeri*\"), and *Mafor Soa Raha* (lit. The Mafor \"Four *Soa*\"). The name comes from the words *papo* (\"to unite\") and *ua* (negation), which means \"not united\", i.e. an outlying possession of Tidore.[1][4][5]\n\n\nAnton Ploeg reports that the word *papua* is often said to be derived from the Malay word *papua* or *pua-pua*, meaning \"frizzly-haired\", referring to the very curly hair of the island's inhabitants.[6] However Sollewijn Gelpke in 1993 considered this unlikely as it had been used earlier, and he instead derived it from the Biak phrase *sup i babwa*, which means \"the land below [the sunset]\", and refers to the Raja Ampat Islands. \n\n\nWhen Portuguese and Spanish explorers arrived via the Spice Islands, they also used the name *Papua*.[1][7] However, Westerners, beginning with Spanish explorer Yñigo Ortiz de Retez in 1545, used the name *New Guinea*, due to the resemblance between the indigenous peoples of the island and Africans of the Guinea region.[1] The name is one of several toponyms sharing similar etymologies, ultimately meaning \"land of the blacks\" or similar meanings.\n\n\nThe Dutch, who arrived later under Jacob Le Maire and Willem Schouten, called it *Schouten island*. They later used this name only to refer to islands off the north coast of Papua proper, the Schouten Islands or Biak Island. When the Dutch colonized the main island as part of the Dutch East Indies, they called it *Nieuw Guinea*.[1]\n\n\nThe name *Irian* was used in the Indonesian language to refer to the island and Indonesian province, as *Irian Barat* (West Irian) Province and later *Irian Jaya* Province. The name Irian was suggested during a tribal committee meeting in Tobati, Jayapura, formed by Soegoro Atmoprasodjo under governor JP van Eechoed, to decide on a new name because of the negative association of *Papua*. Frans Kaisiepo, the committee leader, suggested the name from Mansren Koreri myths, *Iri-an* from the Biak language of Biak Island, meaning \"hot land\" (referring to the climate), but also from *Iryan* which means heated process as a metaphor for a land that is entering a new era. In Serui *Iri-an* (lit. \"land-nation\") means \"pillar of nation\", while in Merauke *Iri-an* (lit. \"placed higher-nation\") means \"rising spirit\" or \"to rise\".[5][8] The name was promoted in 1945 by Marcus Kaisiepo, brother of Frans Kaisiepo.[3] The name was politicized later by Corinus Krey,[9] Marthen Indey, Silas Papare, and others with the Indonesian backronym *Ikut Republik Indonesia Anti Nederland* (\"Join the Republic of Indonesia Oppose the Netherlands\").[10][5] *Irian* was used somewhat in 1972.[11] The name was used until 2001, when *Papua* was again used for the island and the province. The name *Irian*, which was originally favored by natives, is now considered to be a name imposed by the authority of Jakarta.[3]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Regions of Oceania: Australasia, Polynesia, Micronesia, and Melanesia. Physiographically, Australasia includes the Australian landmass (including Tasmania), New Zealand, and New Guinea\n![](image)New Guinea located in relation to Melanesia\n![](image)New Guinea map of Köppen climate classificationSee also: List of highest mountains of New Guinea\n\nNew Guinea is an island to the north of the Australian mainland, south of the equator. It is isolated by the Arafura Sea to the west, and the Torres Strait and Coral Sea to the east. Sometimes considered to be the easternmost island of the Indonesian archipelago, it lies north of Australia's Top End, the Gulf of Carpentaria and Cape York Peninsula, and west of the Bismarck Archipelago and the Solomon Islands archipelago.\n\n\nPolitically, the western half of the island comprises six provinces of Indonesia: Papua, Central Papua, Highland Papua, South Papua, West Papua and Southwest Papua. The eastern half forms the mainland of the country of Papua New Guinea.\n\n\n\n![](image)Topographical map of New Guinea The shape of New Guinea is often compared to that of a bird-of-paradise (indigenous to the island), and this results in the usual names for the two extremes of the island: the Bird's Head Peninsula in the northwest (*Vogelkop* in Dutch, *Kepala Burung* in Indonesian; also known as the Doberai Peninsula), and the Bird's Tail Peninsula in the southeast (also known as the Papuan Peninsula).\n\n\nA spine of east–west mountains, the New Guinea Highlands, dominates the geography of New Guinea, stretching over 1,600 km (1,000 mi) across the island, with many mountains over 4,000 m (13,100 ft). The western half of the island contains the highest mountains in Oceania, with its highest point, Puncak Jaya, reaching an elevation of 4,884 m (16,023 ft). The tree line is around 4,000 m (13,100 ft) elevation, and the tallest peaks contain equatorial glaciers—which have been retreating since at least 1936.[12][13][14] Various other smaller mountain ranges occur both north and west of the central ranges. Except in high elevations, most areas possess a warm humid climate throughout the year, with some seasonal variation associated with the northeast monsoon season.\n\n\n\n![](image)Mount Bosavi\nAnother major habitat feature is the vast southern and northern lowlands. Stretching for hundreds of kilometres, these include lowland rainforests, extensive wetlands, savanna grasslands, and some of the largest expanses of mangrove forest in the world. The southern lowlands are the site of Lorentz National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The northern lowlands are drained principally by the Mamberamo River and its tributaries on the western side, and by the Sepik on the eastern side. The more extensive southern lowlands are drained by a larger number of rivers, principally the Digul in the west and the Fly in the east. The largest island offshore, Dolak, lies near the Digul estuary, separated by a strait so narrow it has been named a \"creek\".\n\n\nNew Guinea contains many of the world's ecosystem types: glacial, alpine tundra, savanna, montane and lowland rainforest, mangroves, wetlands, lake and river ecosystems, seagrasses, and some of the richest coral reefs on the planet.\n\n\nThe entire length of the New Guinea Highlands system passes through New Guinea as a vast watershed. The northern rivers flow into the Pacific Ocean, the southern rivers into the Arafura Sea and the Gulf of Papua. On the north side, the largest rivers are the Mamberamo, Sepik and Ramu.\nMamberamo was born from the confluence of two large inland rivers. Tariku comes from the west to the east and Taritatu from the east. These rivers meander through swamps with huge internal descents and then merge. The Mamberamo thus formed reaches the ocean by breaking through the Coastal Mountains. Mamberamo River is navigable to Marine Falls. The Sepik is a much more important river. Similarly, it collects water from a spacious pool. It is 1,100 kilometers from the Victor Emanuel Range to the estuary, making it the longest river in New Guinea. The winding, muddy, sluggish river can be navigated for 500 km. Ramu is a 650 km long river. Its lower section is navigable, but its upper flow is high-falling, fast-flowing. The energy of the river is used by a power plant near the city of Kainantu.\n\n\nOn the south side, the most significant rivers are Pulau, Digul, Fly, Kikori and Purari. The largest river in the western part of the island is Digul. It originates from the Star Mountains, which rise to an altitude of 4,700 m. The coastal plain is bordered by a swamp world hundreds of kilometers wide. Digul is the main transport route to the fertile hills and mountains within the island. The river Fly is born near the eastern branches of the Digul. It is named after one of the ships of the English Royal Fleet, which first sailed into the mouth of the river in 1845. The total length of the river is 1,050 km. Smaller boats can sail 900 km on the river. The estuary section, which decomposes into islands, is 70 km wide. The tide of the sea can have an effect of up to 300 kilometers. Strickland, a tributary of the Fly, reaches the Papuan Plain through wild gorges. Fly and Strickland together form the largest river in New Guinea. The many rivers flowing into the Gulf of Papua form a single delta complex. The rivers of the island are extremely rich in water due to the annual rainfall of 2,000–10,000 mm. According to a modest calculation, the New Guinea River carries about 1,500 km3/a (48,000 m3/s) of water into the sea. Fly alone carries more water 238 km3/a (7,500 m3/s) than all the rivers in Australia combined.[15]\n\n\n\n## Relation to surroundings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Highlands of Papua New Guinea\nThe island of New Guinea lies to the east of the Malay Archipelago, with which it is sometimes included as part of a greater Indo-Australian Archipelago.[16] Geologically it is a part of the same tectonic plate as Australia. When world sea levels were low, the two shared shorelines (which now lie 100 to 140 metres below sea level),[17] and combined with lands now inundated into the tectonic continent of Sahul,[18][19] also known as Greater Australia.[20] The two landmasses became separated when the area now known as the Torres Strait flooded after the end of the last glacial period.\n\n\nAnthropologically, New Guinea is considered part of Melanesia.[21]\n\n\nNew Guinea is differentiated from its drier, flatter,[22] and less fertile[23][24] southern counterpart, Australia, by its much higher rainfall and its active volcanic geology. Yet the two land masses share a similar animal fauna, with marsupials, including wallabies and possums, and the egg-laying monotreme, the echidna. Other than bats and some two dozen indigenous rodent genera,[25] there are no pre-human indigenous placental mammals. Pigs, several additional species of rats, and the ancestor of the New Guinea singing dog were introduced with human colonization.\n\n\nPrior to the 1970s, archaeologists called the single Pleistocene landmass by the name *Australasia*,[18] although this word is most often used for a wider region that includes lands, such as New Zealand, which are not on the same continental shelf. In the early 1970s, they introduced the term *Greater Australia* for the Pleistocene continent.[18] Then, at a 1975 conference and consequent publication,[19] they extended the name *Sahul* from its previous use for just the Sahul Shelf to cover the continent.[18]\n\n\n\n## Political divisions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Political divisions of New Guinea\n![](image)Papua province\n Highland Papua province\n Central Papua province\n South Papua province\n West Papua province, which was divided in December 2022[26]\n\nThe island of New Guinea is divided politically into roughly equal halves across a north–south line:\n\n\n\n* The western portion of the island located west of 141°E longitude (except for a small section of territory to the east of the Fly River which belongs to Papua New Guinea) was formerly a Dutch colony, part of the Dutch East Indies. After the West New Guinea dispute it is now six Indonesian provinces:\n\t+ West Papua with Manokwari as its capital.\n\t+ Papua with the city of Jayapura as its capital.\n\t+ Highland Papua with Jayawijaya Regency as its capital.\n\t+ Central Papua with Nabire Regency as its capital.\n\t+ South Papua with Merauke Regency as its capital.\n\t+ Southwest Papua with Sorong as its capital\n* The eastern part forms the mainland of Papua New Guinea, which has been an independent country since 1975. It was formerly the Territory of Papua and New Guinea governed by Australia, consisting of the Trust Territory of New Guinea (northeastern quarter, formerly German New Guinea), and the Territory of Papua (southeastern quarter). Three of Papua New Guinea's four regions are parts of New Guinea island:\n\t+ Southern, consisting of Western, Gulf, Central, Oro (Northern) and Milne Bay provinces.\n\t+ Highlands, consisting of Southern Highlands, Hela Province, Jiwaka Province, Enga Province, Western Highlands, Simbu and Eastern Highlands provinces.\n\t+ Momase, consisting of Morobe, Madang, East Sepik and Sandaun (West Sepik) provinces.\n\n\n## People[edit]\n\n\nSee also: People of New Guinea\n\n![](image)Yali tribesman in the Baliem Valley\nThe current population of the island of New Guinea is about fifteen million. Archaeological evidence indicates that humans may have inhabited the island continuously since 50,000 BCE,[27][28] and first settlement possibly dating back to 60,000 years ago has been proposed. The island is presently populated by almost a thousand different tribal groups and a near-equivalent number of separate languages, which makes New Guinea the most linguistically diverse area in the world. Ethnologue's 14th edition lists 826 languages of Papua New Guinea and 257 languages of Western New Guinea, total 1073 languages, with 12 languages overlapping.[*clarification needed*] They can be divided into two groups, the Austronesian languages, and all the others placed in the catch-all category of Papuan languages, most of which are unrelated.[29]\n\n\nThe separation is not merely linguistic; warfare among societies was a factor in the evolution of the *men's house*: separate housing for groups of adult men, away from the single-family houses of women and children.[*citation needed*] Pig-based trade between groups and pig-based feasts form a common tradition with the other peoples of southeast Asia and Oceania. Most Papuan societies practice agriculture, supplemented by hunting and gathering.\n\n\n\n![](image)Yali Mabel, Kurulu Village War Chief at Baliem Valley\nCurrent evidence indicates that the Papuans (who constitute the majority of the island's peoples) are descended from the earliest human inhabitants of New Guinea. These original inhabitants first arrived in New Guinea at a time around the Last Glacial Maximum (c. 21,000 years ago) when the island was connected to the Australian continent via a land bridge, forming the landmass of Sahul. These peoples had made the (shortened) sea-crossing from the islands of Wallacea and Sundaland (the present Malay Archipelago) by at least 40,000 years ago.\n\n\n\n![](image)Korowai tribesman\nThe ancestral Austronesian peoples are believed to have arrived considerably later, approximately 3,500 years ago, as part of a gradual seafaring migration from Southeast Asia, possibly originating in Taiwan. Austronesian-speaking peoples colonized many of the offshore islands to the north and east of New Guinea, such as New Ireland and New Britain, with settlements also on the coastal fringes of the main island in places. Human habitation of New Guinea over tens of thousands of years has led to a great deal of diversity, which was further increased by the later arrival of the Austronesians and the more recent history of European and Asian settlement through events like transmigration. \n\n\nLarge areas of New Guinea are yet to be explored by scientists and anthropologists. The Indonesian province of West Papua is home to an estimated 44 uncontacted tribal groups.[30]\n\n\n\n## Biodiversity and ecology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Fauna of New Guinea\n\nWith some 786,000 km2 of tropical land—less than one-half of one percent (0.5%) of the Earth's surface—New Guinea has an immense biodiversity, containing between 5 and 10 percent of the total species on the planet. This percentage is about the same amount as that found in the United States or Australia. A high percentage of New Guinea's species are endemic, and thousands are still unknown to science: probably well over 200,000 species of insect, between 11,000 and 20,000 plant species, and over 650 resident bird species. Most of these species are shared, at least in their origin, with the continent of Australia, which was until fairly recent geological times part of the same landmass (see Australia-New Guinea for an overview). The island is so large that it is considered 'nearly a continent' in terms of its biological distinctiveness.\n\n\nIn the period from 1998 to 2008, conservationists identified 1,060 new species in New Guinea, including 218 plants, 43 reptiles, 12 mammals, 580 invertebrates, 134 amphibians, 2 birds and 71 fish.[31] Between 2011 and 2017, researchers described 465 previously undocumented plant species in New Guinea.[32] As of 2019, the Indonesian portion of New Guinea and the Maluku Islands is estimated to have 9,518 species of vascular plants, of which 4,380 are endemic. In 2020, an international study conducted by a team of 99 experts cataloged 13,634 species representing 1,742 genera and 264 families of vascular plants for New Guinea and its associated islands (Aru Islands, Bismarck Archipelago, D'Entrecasteaux Islands, Louisiade Archipelago), making it the world's most floristically diverse island, surpassing Madagascar (11,488), Borneo (11,165), Java (4,598), and the Philippines (9,432).[33]\n\n\n\n![](image)The raggiana bird-of-paradise is native to New Guinea.\n![](image)The floristic region of Malesia\nBiogeographically, New Guinea is part of Australasia rather than the Indomalayan realm, although New Guinea's flora has many more affinities with Asia than its fauna, which is overwhelmingly Australian. Botanically, New Guinea is considered part of Malesia, a floristic region that extends from the Malay Peninsula across Indonesia to New Guinea and the East Melanesian Islands. The flora of New Guinea is a mixture of many tropical rainforest species with origins in Asia, together with typically Australasian flora. Typical Southern Hemisphere flora include the conifers *Podocarpus* and the rainforest emergents *Araucaria* and *Agathis,* as well as tree ferns and several species of *Eucalyptus*.\n\n\nNew Guinea has 284 species and six orders of mammals: monotremes, three orders of marsupials, rodents and bats; 195 of the mammal species (69%) are endemic. New Guinea has 578 species of breeding birds, of which 324 species are endemic. The island's frogs are one of the most poorly known vertebrate groups, totalling 282 species, but this number is expected to double or even triple when all species have been documented. New Guinea has a rich diversity of coral life and 1,200 species of fish have been found. Also about 600 species of reef-building coral—the latter equal to 75 percent of the world's known total. The entire coral area covers 18 million hectares off a peninsula in northwest New Guinea.\n\n\n\n![](image)New Guinea crocodile\nAs of 2020, the Western portion of New Guinea, Papua and West Papua, accounts for 54% of the island's primary forest and about 51% of the island's total tree cover, according to satellite data.[34]\n\n\n\n### Ecoregions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ecoregions of New Guinea\n\n#### Terrestrial[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the WWF, New Guinea can be divided into twelve terrestrial ecoregions:[35]\n\n\n\n* Central Range montane rain forests\n* Central Range sub-alpine grasslands\n* Huon Peninsula montane rain forests\n* New Guinea mangroves\n* Northern New Guinea lowland rain and freshwater swamp forests\n* Northern New Guinea montane rain forests\n* Southeastern Papuan rain forests\n* Southern New Guinea freshwater swamp forests\n* Southern New Guinea lowland rain forests\n* Trans-Fly savanna and grasslands\n* Vogelkop montane rain forests\n* Vogelkop-Aru lowland rain forests\n\n\n![](image)Coral reefs in Papua New Guinea\n#### Freshwater[edit]\n\n\nThe WWF and Nature Conservancy divide New Guinea into five freshwater ecoregions:[36]\n\n\n\n* Vogelkop–Bomberai\n* New Guinea North Coast\n* New Guinea Central Mountains\n* Southwest New Guinea–Trans-Fly Lowland\n* Papuan Peninsula\n\n\n#### Marine[edit]\n\n\nThe WWF and Nature Conservancy identify several marine ecoregions in the seas bordering New Guinea:[37]\n\n\n\n* Papua\n* Bismarck Sea\n* Solomon Sea\n* Southeast Papua New Guinea\n* Gulf of Papua\n* Arafura Sea\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: History of Papua New Guinea and History of Western New Guinea\n\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The continent of Sahul before the rising ocean sundered Australia and New Guinea after the last ice age\nThe first inhabitants Indigenous people of New Guinea, from whom the Papuan people are probably descended, adapted to the range of ecologies and, in time, developed one of the earliest known agricultures. Remains of this agricultural system, in the form of ancient irrigation systems in the highlands of Papua New Guinea, are being studied by archaeologists. Research indicates that the highlands were an early and independent center of agriculture, with evidence of irrigation going back at least 10,000 years.[38] Sugarcane was cultivated in New Guinea around 6000 BCE.[39]\n\n\nThe gardens of the New Guinea Highlands are ancient, intensive permacultures, adapted to high population densities, very high rainfalls (as high as 10,000 mm per year (400 in/yr)), earthquakes, hilly land, and occasional frost. Complex mulches, crop rotations and tillages are used in rotation on terraces with complex irrigation systems. Western agronomists still do not understand all of the practices, and it has been noted that native gardeners are as, or even more, successful than most scientific farmers in raising certain crops.[40] There is evidence that New Guinea gardeners invented crop rotation well before western Europeans.[41] A unique feature of New Guinea permaculture is the silviculture of *Casuarina oligodon*, a tall, sturdy native ironwood tree, suited to use for timber and fuel, with root nodules that fix nitrogen. Pollen studies show that it was adopted during an ancient period of extreme deforestation.\n\n\nIn more recent millennia, another wave of people arrived on the shores of New Guinea. These were the Austronesian people, who had spread down from Taiwan, through the South-east Asian archipelago, colonising many of the islands on the way. The Austronesian people had technology and skills extremely well adapted to ocean voyaging and Austronesian language speaking people are present along much of the coastal areas and islands of New Guinea. They also introduced pigs and dogs. These Austronesian migrants are considered the ancestors of most people in insular Southeast Asia, from Sumatra and Java to Borneo and Sulawesi, as well as coastal new Guinea.[42]\n\n\n\n### Precolonial history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Group of natives at Mairy Pass. Mainland of British New Guinea in 1885.\n![](image)Papuans on the Lorentz River, photographed during the third South New Guinea expedition in 1912–13\nThe western part of the island was in contact with kingdoms in other parts of modern-day Indonesia. The *Negarakertagama* mentioned the region of Wanin and Sran, in eastern Nusantara as part of Majapahit's tributary. This 'Wanin' has been identified with the Onin Peninsula, part of the Bomberai Peninsula near the city of Fakfak.[43][44], while 'Sran' had been identified as region of Kowiai, just south of Onin peninsula.[5] The sultans of Tidore, in the Maluku Islands, claimed sovereignty over various coastal parts of the island.[45] During Tidore's rule, the main exports of the island during this period were resins, spices, slaves and the highly priced feathers of the bird-of-paradise. In a period of constant conflict called 'hongi wars', in which rival villages or kingdoms would invoke the name of Tidore Sultan, rightly, for punitive expeditions for not fulfilling their tributary obligations, or opportunitively for competitions over resources and prestige.[45] Sultan Nuku, one of the most famous Tidore sultans who rebelled against Dutch colonization, called himself \"Sultan of Tidore and Papua\",[46] during his revolt in 1780s. He commanded loyalty from both Moluccan and Papuan chiefs, especially those of Raja Ampat Islands, from his base in Gebe. Following Tidore's subjugation as Dutch tributary, much of the territory it claimed in western part of New Guinea came under Dutch rule as part of Dutch East Indies.[46]\n\n\n\n### European contact[edit]\n\n\nThe first European contact with New Guinea was by Portuguese and Spanish sailors in the 16th century. In 1526–27, Portuguese explorer Jorge de Meneses saw the western tip of New Guinea and named it *ilhas dos Papuas*. In 1528, the Spanish navigator Álvaro de Saavedra also recorded its sighting when trying to return from Tidore to New Spain. In 1545, Spaniard Íñigo Ortíz de Retes sailed along the north coast of New Guinea as far as the Mamberamo River, near which he landed on 20 June, naming the island 'Nueva Guinea'.[47] The first map showing the whole island (as an island) was published in 1600[*citation needed*] and shows it as 'Nova Guinea'. In 1606, Luís Vaz de Torres explored the southern coast of New Guinea from Milne Bay to the Gulf of Papua including Orangerie Bay, which he named *Bahía de San Lorenzo*. His expedition also discovered Basilaki Island naming it *Tierra de San Buenaventura*, which he claimed for Spain in July 1606.[48] On 18 October, his expedition reached the western part of the island in present-day Indonesia, and also claimed the territory for the King of Spain.\n\n\n\n![](image)New Guinea from 1884 to 1919. The Netherlands controlled the western half of New Guinea, Germany the north-eastern part, and Britain the south-eastern part.\nA successive European claim occurred in 1828, when the Netherlands formally claimed the western half of the island as Netherlands New Guinea. Dutch colonial authority built Fort Du Bus an administrative and trading post established near Lobo, Triton Bay, but by 1835 had been abandoned.[49] Considering that New Guinea had little economic value for them, the Dutch promoted Tidore as suzerain of Papua. By 1849, Tidore's borders had been extended to the proximity of the current international border between Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, as it formed extensive trade pact and custom of *Uli-Siwa* ( federation of nine ).[50]\n\n\nIn 1883, following a short-lived French annexation of New Ireland, the British colony of Queensland annexed south-eastern New Guinea. However, the Queensland government's superiors in the United Kingdom revoked the claim, and (formally) assumed direct responsibility in 1884, when Germany claimed north-eastern New Guinea as the protectorate of German New Guinea (also called Kaiser-Wilhelmsland).\n\n\nThe first Dutch government posts were established in 1898 and in 1902: Manokwari on the north coast, Fak-Fak in the west and Merauke in the south at the border with British New Guinea. The German, Dutch and British colonial administrators each attempted to suppress the still-widespread practices of inter-village warfare and headhunting within their respective territories.[51]\n\n\nIn 1905, the British government transferred some administrative responsibility over southeast New Guinea to Australia (which renamed the area \"Territory of Papua\"); and, in 1906, transferred all remaining responsibility to Australia. During World War I, Australian forces seized German New Guinea, which in 1920 became the Territory of New Guinea, to be administered by Australia under a League of Nations mandate. The territories under Australian administration became collectively known as The Territories of Papua and New Guinea (until February 1942).\n\n\nBefore about 1930, European maps showed the highlands as uninhabited forests.[52] When first flown over by aircraft, numerous settlements with agricultural terraces and stockades were observed. The most startling discovery took place on 4 August 1938, when Richard Archbold discovered the Grand Valley of the Baliem River, which had 50,000 yet-undiscovered Stone Age farmers living in orderly villages. The people, known as the Dani, were the last society of its size to make first contact with the rest of the world.[53] A 1930 expedition led by the prospector Michael Lehay also encountered an indigenous group in the highlands. The inhabitants, believing themselves to be the only people in the world and, having never seen Europeans before, initially believed the explorers to be spirits of the dead due to the local belief that a person's skin turned white when they died and crossed into the land of the dead.[54]\n\n\n\n![](image)A Japanese military map of New Guinea from 1943\n### World War II[edit]\n\n\nMain article: New Guinea campaign\n\n![](image)Australian soldiers resting in the Finisterre Ranges of New Guinea while en route to the front line\nNetherlands New Guinea and the Australian territories (the eastern half ) were invaded in 1942 by the Japanese. The Netherlands were defeated by that stage and did not put up a fight, and the western section was not of any strategic value to either side, they did not battle there. The Japanese invaded the north shore of the Australia territories and were aiming to move south and take the southern shore too. The highlands, northern and eastern parts of the island became key battlefields in the South West Pacific Theatre of World War II. Notable battles were for Port Moresby ( the naval battle is known as the Battle of the Coral Sea), Milne Bay and for the Kakoda track. Papuans often gave vital assistance to the Allies, fighting alongside Australian troops, and carrying equipment and injured men across New Guinea. Approximately 216,000 Japanese, Australian and U.S. soldiers, sailors and airmen died during the New Guinea Campaign.[55]\n\n\n\n### Since World War II[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Papua conflict\n\nFollowing the return to civil administration after World War II, the Australian section was known as the Territory of Papua-New Guinea from 1945 to 1949 and then as Territory of Papua and New Guinea. Although the rest of the Dutch East Indies achieved independence as Indonesia on 27 December 1949, the Netherlands regained control of western New Guinea.\n\n\n\n![](image)Map of New Guinea, with place names as used in English in the 1940s\nDuring the 1950s, the Dutch government began to prepare Netherlands New Guinea for full independence and allowed elections in 1959; the partial elected New Guinea Council took office on 5 April 1961. The Council decided on the name of West Papua (*Papua Barat*) for the territory, along with an emblem, flag, and anthem to complement those of the Netherlands. On 1 October 1962, after some military interventions and negotiations, the Dutch handed over the territory to the United Nations Temporary Executive Authority, until 1 May 1963, when Indonesia took control. The territory was renamed West Irian (*Irian Barat*) and then Irian Jaya. In 1969, Indonesia, under the 1962 New York Agreement, organised a referendum named the Act of Free Choice, in which the military hand picked Papuan tribal elders to vote for integration with Indonesia.[56][57]\n\n\nThere has been significant reported resistance to Indonesian integration and occupation,[58] both through civil disobedience (such as publicly raising the Morning Star flag) and via the formation of the Organisasi Papua Merdeka (OPM, or Free Papua Movement) in 1965.[59] Amnesty International has estimated more than 100,000 Papuans, one-sixth of the population, have died as a result of government-sponsored violence against West Papuans.[60] Reports published by TRT World and De Gruyter Oldenbourg have put the number of killed Papuans since the start of the conflict at roughly 500,000.[61][62]\n\n\n\n![](image)Western New Guinea was formally annexed by Indonesia in 1969.\nFrom 1971, the name Papua New Guinea was used for the Australian territory. On 16 September 1975, Australia granted full independence to Papua New Guinea. In 2000, Irian Jaya was formally renamed \"The Province of Papua\" and a Law on Special Autonomy was passed in 2001. The Law established a Papuan People's Assembly (MRP) with representatives of the different indigenous cultures of Papua. The MRP was empowered to protect the rights of Papuans, raise the status of women in Papua, and to ease religious tensions in Papua; block grants were given for the implementation of the Law as much as $266 million in 2004.[63] The Indonesian courts' enforcement of the Law on Special Autonomy blocked further creation of subdivisions of Papua: although President Megawati Sukarnoputri was able to create a separate West Papua province in 2003 as a fait accompli, plans for a third province on western New Guinea were blocked by the courts.[64] Critics argue that the Indonesian government has been reluctant to establish or issue various government implementing regulations so that the legal provisions of special autonomy could be put into practice, and as a result special autonomy in Papua has \"failed\".[65][66]\n\n\nIn 2022, the Indonesian Government split Papuan Province into four provinces. In addition to Papua Province proper (capital Jayapura), the three new provinces are South Papua (capital Merauke), Central Papua (capital Nabire) and Highland Papua (capital Wamena).[67]\n\n\nThe culture of inter-tribal warfare and animosity between the neighboring tribes are still present in New Guinea.[68]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The alternative name *Nugini* is generally only used as part of the country name of Papua New Guinea, *Papua Nugini*, and of the names of the historical territories of Dutch New Guinea (*Nugini Belanda*), German New Guinea (*Nugini Jerman*), and Territory of New Guinea (*Teritori Nugini*). Thus, *Nugini* is effectively a fossil word.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** Bilveer Singh (2008). *Papua: geopolitics and the quest for nationhood*.

Palm oil plantations have been widely developed and are rapidly encroaching on the last remnants of primary rainforest.[48] Forest fires since 1997, started by the locals to clear the forests for plantations were exacerbated by an exceptionally dry El Niño season, worsening the annual shrinkage of the rainforest.[49] During these fires, hotspots were visible on satellite images and the resulting haze frequently affected Brunei, Indonesia and Malaysia. The haze could also reach southern Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and the Philippines as evidenced on the 2015 Southeast Asian haze.[50]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Borneo lowland rain forests cover most of the island, with an area of 427,500 square kilometres (165,100 sq mi).\n* Borneo peat swamp forests\n* *Kerangas* or Sundaland heath forests\n* Southwest Borneo freshwater swamp forests are found in the island's western and southern lowlands\n* Sunda Shelf mangroves\n* The Borneo montane rain forests lie in the central highlands of the island, above the 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) elevation.\n* The highest elevations of Mount Kinabalu are home to the Kinabalu montane alpine meadows, a subalpine and alpine shrubland notable for its numerous endemic species, including many orchids.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nBorneo\n |\n| --- |\n| politicaldivisions | * **Kalimantan** (Indonesia)\n\t+ West Kalimantan\n\t+ Central Kalimantan\n\t+ South Kalimantan\n\t+ East Kalimantan\n\t+ Nusantara\n\t+ North Kalimantan\n* **Brunei**\n* **East Malaysia**\n\t+ Labuan\n\t+ Sabah\n\t+ Sarawak\n |\n| eco-regions | * Borneo lowland rain forests\n* Borneo montane rain forests\n* Borneo peat swamp forests\n* Kinabalu montane alpine meadows\n* Southwest Borneo freshwater swamp forests\n* Sundaland heath forests\n* Sunda Shelf mangroves\n |\n| environment | * Biodiversity\n\t+ Flora\n\t+ Fauna\n\t+ Mammals\n* Geological history of Borneo\n\t+ Sundaland\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Kapuas River 1,143 km (710 mi)\n* Barito River 1,090 km (680 mi)\n* Mahakam River 980 km (610 mi)\n* Kahayan River 658 km (409 mi)\n* Mendawai River 616 km (383 mi)\n* Kayan River 576 km (358 mi)\n* Rajang River 565 km (351 mi)\n* Kinabatangan River 560 km (350 mi)\n* Baram River 400 km (250 mi)\n* Sembakung River 352 km (219 mi)\n* Sesayap River 279 km (173 mi)\n* Pawan River 197 km (122 mi)\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Dayak, the main indigenous people in the island, were feared for their headhunting practices.\nIn November 2018, scientists reported the discovery of the oldest known figurative art painting, over 40,000 (perhaps as old as 52,000) years old, of an unknown animal, in the cave of Lubang Jeriji Saléh on the island of Borneo.[52][53]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n41. **^** \"Scientists discover new species in Heart of Borneo\".

Deeper waters separating Borneo from neighbouring Sulawesi prevented a land connection to that island, creating the divide known as Wallace's Line between Asian and Australia-New Guinea biological regions.[20][21] The island today is surrounded by the South China Sea to the north and northwest, the Sulu Sea to the northeast, the Celebes Sea and the Makassar Strait to the east, and the Java Sea and Karimata Strait to the south.

In southeast Sabah, the Miocene to recent island arc terranes of the Sulu Archipelago extend onshore into Borneo with the older volcanic arc was the result of southeast dipping subduction while the younger volcanics are likely resulted from northwest dipping subduction the Celebes Sea.[19]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 977, Chinese records began to use the term *Bo-ni* to refer to Borneo.

This resulted in indirectly establishing British- and Dutch-controlled areas in the north (Malay Peninsula) and south (Sumatra and Riau Islands) respectively.[102]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Territorial loss of the thalassocracy of the Sultanate of Brunei from 1400 to 1890 due to the beginning of Western imperialism\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince the fall of Singapore, the Japanese sent several thousand of British and Australian prisoners of war to camps in Borneo such as Batu Lintang camp. From the Sandakan camp site, only six of some 2,500 prisoners survived after they were forced to march in an event known as the Sandakan Death March.[114] In addition, of the total of 17,488 Javanese labourers brought in by the Japanese during the occupation, only 1,500 survived mainly due to starvation, harsh working conditions and maltreatment.[107] The Dayak and other indigenous people played a role in guerrilla warfare against the occupying forces, particularly in the Kapit Division. They temporarily revived headhunting of Japanese toward the end of the war,[115] with Allied Z Special Unit provided assistance to them.[116] Australia contributed significantly to the liberation of Borneo.[117] The Australian Imperial Force was sent to Borneo to fight off the Japanese.[118] Together with other Allies, the island was completely liberated in 1945.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nStone pillars bearing inscriptions in the Pallava script, found in Kutai along the Mahakam River in East Kalimantan and dating to around the second half of the 4th century, constitute some of the oldest evidence of Hindu influence in Southeast Asia.[57] By the 14th century, Borneo became a vassal state of Majapahit (in present-day Indonesia),[58][59] later changing its allegiance to the Ming dynasty of China.[60] Pre-Islamic Sulu, then known locally as Lupah Sug, stretched from Palawan and the Sulu archipelago at the Philippines; to Sabah, Eastern, and Northern Kalimantan in Borneo.[61] The Sulu empire rose as a rebellion and reaction against former Majapahit Imperialism against Sulu which Majapahit briefly occupied. The religion of Islam entered the island in the 10th century,[62] following the arrival of Muslim traders who later converted many indigenous peoples in the coastal areas.[63]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Sultanate of Brunei at the first welcomed the proposal of a new larger federation.[134] Meanwhile, the Brunei People's Party led by A.M. Azahari desired to reunify Brunei, Sarawak and North Borneo into one federation known as the North Borneo Federation (Malay: *Kesatuan Negara Kalimantan Utara*), where the sultan of Brunei would be the head of state for the federation—though Azahari had his own intention to abolish the Brunei monarchy, to make Brunei more democratic, and to integrate the territory and other former British colonies in Borneo into Indonesia, with the support from the latter government.[135] This directly led to the Brunei Revolt, which thwarted Azahari's attempt and forced him to escape to Indonesia. Brunei withdrew from being part of the new Federation of Malaysia due to some disagreements on other issues while political leaders in Sarawak and North Borneo continued to favour inclusion in a larger federation.[136]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_utFhFtPpb2qXZMnK9MiFaDW6","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Palm oil plantations have been widely developed and are rapidly encroaching on the last remnants of primary rainforest.[48] Forest fires since 1997, started by the locals to clear the forests for plantations were exacerbated by an exceptionally dry El Niño season, worsening the annual shrinkage of the rainforest.[49] During these fires, hotspots were visible on satellite images and the resulting haze frequently affected Brunei, Indonesia and Malaysia. The haze could also reach southern Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and the Philippines as evidenced on the 2015 Southeast Asian haze.[50]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Borneo lowland rain forests cover most of the island, with an area of 427,500 square kilometres (165,100 sq mi).\n* Borneo peat swamp forests\n* *Kerangas* or Sundaland heath forests\n* Southwest Borneo freshwater swamp forests are found in the island's western and southern lowlands\n* Sunda Shelf mangroves\n* The Borneo montane rain forests lie in the central highlands of the island, above the 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) elevation.\n* The highest elevations of Mount Kinabalu are home to the Kinabalu montane alpine meadows, a subalpine and alpine shrubland notable for its numerous endemic species, including many orchids.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nBorneo\n |\n| --- |\n| politicaldivisions | * **Kalimantan** (Indonesia)\n\t+ West Kalimantan\n\t+ Central Kalimantan\n\t+ South Kalimantan\n\t+ East Kalimantan\n\t+ Nusantara\n\t+ North Kalimantan\n* **Brunei**\n* **East Malaysia**\n\t+ Labuan\n\t+ Sabah\n\t+ Sarawak\n |\n| eco-regions | * Borneo lowland rain forests\n* Borneo montane rain forests\n* Borneo peat swamp forests\n* Kinabalu montane alpine meadows\n* Southwest Borneo freshwater swamp forests\n* Sundaland heath forests\n* Sunda Shelf mangroves\n |\n| environment | * Biodiversity\n\t+ Flora\n\t+ Fauna\n\t+ Mammals\n* Geological history of Borneo\n\t+ Sundaland\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Kapuas River 1,143 km (710 mi)\n* Barito River 1,090 km (680 mi)\n* Mahakam River 980 km (610 mi)\n* Kahayan River 658 km (409 mi)\n* Mendawai River 616 km (383 mi)\n* Kayan River 576 km (358 mi)\n* Rajang River 565 km (351 mi)\n* Kinabatangan River 560 km (350 mi)\n* Baram River 400 km (250 mi)\n* Sembakung River 352 km (219 mi)\n* Sesayap River 279 km (173 mi)\n* Pawan River 197 km (122 mi)\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Dayak, the main indigenous people in the island, were feared for their headhunting practices.\nIn November 2018, scientists reported the discovery of the oldest known figurative art painting, over 40,000 (perhaps as old as 52,000) years old, of an unknown animal, in the cave of Lubang Jeriji Saléh on the island of Borneo.[52][53]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n41. **^** \"Scientists discover new species in Heart of Borneo\".

The South China Sea and Gulf of Thailand now submerge the former low-lying areas of the peninsula. Deeper waters separating Borneo from neighbouring Sulawesi prevented a land connection to that island, creating the divide known as Wallace's Line between Asian and Australia-New Guinea biological regions.[20][21] The island today is surrounded by the South China Sea to the north and northwest, the Sulu Sea to the northeast, the Celebes Sea and the Makassar Strait to the east, and the Java Sea and Karimata Strait to the south.

The Javanese named Borneo *Puradvipa*, or Diamond Island.

In southeast Sabah, the Miocene to recent island arc terranes of the Sulu Archipelago extend onshore into Borneo with the older volcanic arc was the result of southeast dipping subduction while the younger volcanics are likely resulted from northwest dipping subduction the Celebes Sea.[19]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 977, Chinese records began to use the term *Bo-ni* to refer to Borneo.

King Andrianjaka founded Antananarivo as the capital of his Imerina Kingdom around 1610 or 1625 upon the site of a captured Vazimba capital on the hilltop of Analamanga.[44] As Merina dominance expanded over neighboring Malagasy peoples in the early 19th century to establish the Kingdom of Madagascar, Antananarivo became the center of administration for virtually the entire island. In 1896 the French colonizers of Madagascar adopted the Merina capital as their center of colonial administration. The city remained the capital of Madagascar after regaining independence in 1960. In 2017, the capital's population was estimated at 1,391,433 inhabitants.[150] The next largest cities are Antsirabe (500,000), Toamasina (450,000) and Mahajanga (400,000).[47]\n\n\n\n### Politics[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Land coverage (left) and topographical (right) maps of Madagascar\nAt 592,800 square kilometres (228,900 sq mi),[47] Madagascar is the world's 46th largest country,[92] the second-largest island country[13] and the fourth-largest island.[47] The country lies mostly between latitudes 12°S and 26°S, and longitudes 43°E and 51°E.[93] Neighboring islands include the French territory of Réunion and the country of Mauritius to the east, as well as the state of Comoros and the French territory of Mayotte to the north west.

To the west of the highlands, the increasingly arid terrain gradually slopes down to the Mozambique Channel and mangrove swamps along the coast.[96]\n\n\nMadagascar's highest peaks rise from three prominent highland massifs: Maromokotro 2,876 m (9,436 ft) in the Tsaratanana Massif is the island's highest point, followed by Boby Peak 2,658 m (8,720 ft) in the Andringitra Massif, and Tsiafajavona 2,643 m (8,671 ft) in the Ankaratra Massif.

According to the constitution, executive power is exercised by the government while legislative power is vested in the ministerial cabinet,[146] the Senate and the National Assembly, although in reality these two latter bodies have very little power or legislative role. The constitution establishes independent executive, legislative and judicial branches and mandates a popularly elected president limited to three five-year terms.[47]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHistorically, security has been relatively high across the island.[136] Violent crime rates are low, and criminal activities are predominantly crimes of opportunity such as pickpocketing and petty theft, although child prostitution, human trafficking and the production and sale of marijuana and other illegal drugs are increasing.[148] Budget cuts since 2009 have severely impacted the national police force, producing a steep increase in criminal activity in recent years.[136]\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Regions of Madagascar and Districts of Madagascar\n\nMadagascar is subdivided into 22 regions (*faritra*).[47] The regions are further subdivided into 119 districts, 1,579 communes, and 17,485 *fokontany*.[165]\n\n\n\n![](image)A map of Madagascar's regions\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSeal\n |\n| **Motto:*** *Fitiavana, Tanindrazana, Fandrosoana* (Malagasy)\n* *Amour, Patrie, Progrès* (French)\n* \"Love, Fatherland, Progress\"[1]\n |\n| **Anthem:** *Ry Tanindrazanay malala ô!* (Malagasy)*Ô Terre de nos ancêtres bien-aimés!* (French)\"Oh, beloved land of our ancestors!\" |\n| ![Location of Madagascar (dark green)](image)Location of Madagascar (dark green)\n |\n| Capitaland largest city\n | Antananarivo18°55′S 47°31′E﻿ / ﻿18.917°S 47.517°E﻿ / -18.917; 47.517 |\n| Official languages | Malagasy • French |\n| Ethnic groups (2017)[2]\n | * 26% Merina\n* 15% Betsimisaraka\n* 12% Betsileo\n* 7% Tsimihety\n* 6% Sakalava\n* 5% Antaisaka\n* 5% Antandroy\n* 24% others\n |\n| Religion (2020)[3]\n | * 84.7% Christianity\n* —45.8% Protestantism\n* —38.1% Catholicism\n* —0.8% other Christian\n* 7.3% no religion\n* 4.7% traditional faiths\n* 3.1% Islam\n* 0.3% others\n |\n| Demonym(s) | Malagasy[4][5] |\n| Government | Unitary semi-presidential republic |\n|  |\n| • Acting President\n | Richard Ravalomanana |\n| • Prime Minister\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Regions and former provinces**[166]\n| New regions | Formerprovinces | Area inkm2 | Population2018[167] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Diana | Antsiranana | 19,993 | 889,962\n |\n| Sava | Antsiranana | 23,794 | 1,123,772\n |\n| Itasy | Antananarivo | 6,579 | 898,549\n |\n| Analamanga | Antananarivo | 17,346 | 3,623,925\n |\n| Vakinankaratra | Antananarivo | 17,884 | 2,079,659\n |\n| Bongolava | Antananarivo | 18,096 | 670,993\n |\n| Sofia (7) | Mahajanga | 50,973 | 1,507,591\n |\n| Boeny | Mahajanga | 31,250 | 929,312\n |\n| Betsiboka | Mahajanga | 28,964 | 393,278\n |\n| Melaky | Mahajanga | 40,863 | 308,944\n |\n| Alaotra Mangoro | Toamasina | 27,846 | 1,249,931\n |\n| Atsinanana | Toamasina | 22,031 | 1,478,472\n |\n| Analanjirofo | Toamasina | 21,666 | 1,150,089\n |\n| Amoron'i Mania | Fianarantsoa | 16,480 | 837,116\n |\n| Haute-Matsiatra | Fianarantsoa | 20,820 | 1,444,587\n |\n| Vatovavy-Fitovinany | Fianarantsoa | 20,740 | 1,440,657\n |\n| Atsimo-Atsinanana | Fianarantsoa | 16,632 | 1,030,404\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n100. **^** Rabary, Lovasoa (6 February 2022). \"Cyclone kills at least 10 in Madagascar, destroying homes and cutting power\". *Reuters*.

In a map by Muhammad al-Idrisi dating from the year 1154, the island is named *Gesira Malai*, or \"Malay island\" in Arabic. The inversion of this name to *Malai Gesira*, as it was known by the Greeks, is thought to be the precursor of the modern name of the island.[27] The name \"Malay island\" was later rendered in Latin as *Malichu*, an abbreviated form of *Malai Insula*, in the medieval Hereford Mappa Mundi as the name of Madagascar.[28][27]\n\n\nAnother hypothesis is that *Madagascar* is a corrupted transliteration of Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia and an important medieval Indian Ocean port. This would have resulted from 13th-century Venetian explorer Marco Polo confusing the two locations in his memoirs, in which he mentions the land of *Madageiscar* to the south of Socotra.

Locally produced beverages include fruit juices, coffee, herbal teas and teas, and alcoholic drinks such as rum, wine, and beer.[241] Three Horses Beer is the most popular beer on the island[263] and is considered emblematic of Madagascar.[264]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Madagascar portal\n\n\n* Index of Madagascar-related articles\n* Outline of Madagascar\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^**  (/ˌmædəˈɡæskər, -kɑːr/; Malagasy: *Madagasikara*, pronounced [ma.da.ɡa.si.kʲa.ra]) (Malagasy: *Repoblikan'i Madagasikara*, Malagasy pronunciation: [repuˈblikʲanʲ madaɡasʲˈkʲarə̥]; French: *République de Madagascar*)\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe combination of southeastern trade winds and northwestern monsoons produces a hot rainy season (November–April) with frequently destructive cyclones, and a relatively cooler dry season (May–October). Rain clouds originating over the Indian Ocean discharge much of their moisture over the island's eastern coast; the heavy precipitation supports the area's rainforest ecosystem. The central highlands are both drier and cooler while the west is drier still, and a semi-arid climate prevails in the southwest and southern interior of the island.[96]\n\n\nTropical cyclones cause damage to infrastructure and local economies as well as loss of life.[46] In 2004, Cyclone Gafilo became the strongest cyclone ever recorded to hit Madagascar. The storm killed 172 people, left 214,260 homeless[98] and caused more than US$250 million in damage.[99] In February 2022, Cyclone Batsirai killed at least 10 people weeks after Cyclone Ana killed 55 and displaced 130,000 people on the island.[100]\n\n\n\n### Ecology[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThere are several rail lines in Madagascar. Antananarivo is connected to Toamasina, Ambatondrazaka and Antsirabe by rail, and another rail line connects Fianarantsoa to Manakara. The most important seaport in Madagascar is located on the east coast at Toamasina. Ports at Mahajanga and Antsiranana are significantly less used because of their remoteness.[46] Madagascar's government hopes to expand the ports of Antsiranana in the north and Taolagnaro in the south, connecting them to improved road networks, since many imports are every day necessities and Madagascar also relies on export money.**[196]**[198][199] The island's newest port at Ehoala, constructed in 2008 and privately managed by Rio Tinto, will come under state control upon completion of the company's mining project near Tôlanaro around 2038.[190] Air Madagascar services the island's many small regional airports, which offer the only practical means of access to many of the more remote regions during rainy season road washouts.[46]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe wealth generated by maritime trade spurred the rise of organized kingdoms on the island, some of which had grown quite powerful by the 17th century.[52] Among these were the Betsimisaraka alliance of the eastern coast and the Sakalava chiefdoms of Menabe and Boina on the west coast. The Kingdom of Imerina, located in the central highlands with its capital at the royal palace of Antananarivo, emerged at around the same time under the leadership of King Andriamanelo.[53]\n\n\n\n### Kingdom of Madagascar[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Merina Kingdom\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe island's elephant birds, a family of endemic giant ratites, became extinct in the 17th century or earlier, most probably because of human hunting of adult birds and poaching of their large eggs for food.[138] Numerous giant lemur species vanished with the arrival of human settlers to the island, while others became extinct over the course of the centuries as a growing human population put greater pressures on lemur habitats and, among some populations, increased the rate of lemur hunting for food.[139] A July 2012 assessment found that the exploitation of natural resources since 2009 has had dire consequences for the island's wildlife: 90 percent of lemur species were found to be threatened with extinction, the highest proportion of any mammalian group. Of these, 23 species were classified as critically endangered. A 2023 study published in *Nature Communications* found that 120 of the 219 mammal species only found on Madagascar are threatened with extinction.[140]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n168. **^** \"United Nations Member States | Meetings Coverage and Press Releases\". *www.un.org*.

Reporters are occasionally threatened or harassed, and media outlets are periodically forced to close.[149] Accusations of media censorship have increased since 2009 because of the alleged intensification of restrictions on political criticism.[156] Access to the internet has grown dramatically over the past decade, with an estimated 352,000 residents of Madagascar accessing the internet from home or in one of the nation's many internet cafés in December 2011.[149]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Demographics of Madagascar and List of cities in Madagascar\n\n![map of Madagascar showing distribution of Malagasy ethnic subgroups](image)The regional distribution of Malagasy ethnic subgroups\nAgriculture has long influenced settlement on the island.

Over 300 species of birds have been recorded on the island, of which over 60 percent (including four families and 42 genera) are endemic.[101] The few families and genera of reptiles that have reached Madagascar have diversified into more than 260 species, with over 90 percent of these being endemic[127] (including one endemic family).[101] The island is home to two-thirds of the world's chameleon species,[127] including the smallest known.[128]\n\n\nEndemic fish of Madagascar include two families, 15 genera and over 100 species, primarily inhabiting the island's freshwater lakes and rivers. Although invertebrates remain poorly studied in Madagascar, researchers have found high rates of endemism among the known species. All 651 species of terrestrial snail are endemic, as are a majority of the island's butterflies, scarab beetles, lacewings, spiders, and dragonflies.[101]\n\n\n\n### Environmental issues[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nChinese, Indian and Comoran minorities are present in Madagascar, as well as a small European (primarily French) populace. Emigration in the late 20th century has reduced these minority populations, occasionally in abrupt waves, such as the exodus of Comorans in 1976, following anti-Comoran riots in Mahajanga.[46] By comparison, there has been no significant emigration of Malagasy peoples.[97] The number of Europeans has declined since independence, reduced from 68,430 in 1958[81] to 17,000 three decades later. There were an estimated 25,000 Comorans, 18,000 Indians, and 9,000 Chinese living in Madagascar in the mid-1980s.[46]\n\n\n\n### Largest cities[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n96. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Vences M, Wollenberg KC, Vieites DR, Lees DC (June 2009). \"Madagascar as a model region of species diversification\" (PDF). *Trends in Ecology and Evolution*. **24** (8): 456–465. doi:10.1016/j.tree.2009.03.011.

The country is home to seven terrestrial ecoregions: Madagascar lowland forests, Madagascar subhumid forests, Madagascar dry deciduous forests, Madagascar ericoid thickets, Madagascar spiny forests, Madagascar succulent woodlands, and Madagascar mangroves.[105]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana resulted in the separation of East Gondwana (comprising Madagascar, Antarctica, Australia and the Indian subcontinent) and West Gondwana (Africa–South America) during the Jurassic period, around 185 million years ago. The Indo-Madagascar landmass separated from Antarctica and Australia around 125 million years ago[94] and Madagascar separated from the Indian landmass about 84–92 million years ago during the Late Cretaceous.[95] This long history of separation from other continents has allowed plants and animals on the island to evolve in relative isolation. Along the length of the eastern coast runs a narrow and steep escarpment containing much of the island's remaining tropical lowland forest. To the west of this ridge lies a plateau in the center of the island ranging in altitude from 750 to 1,500 m (2,460 to 4,920 ft) above sea level. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n14. **^** Raval, U.; Veeraswamy, K.

Although banned by then-President Marc Ravalomanana from 2000 to 2009, the collection of small quantities of precious timber from national parks was re-authorized in January 2009 and dramatically intensified under the administration of Andry Rajoelina as a key source of state revenues to offset cuts in donor support following Ravalomanana's ousting.[136]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nExports formed 28 percent of GDP in 2009.[47] Most of the country's export revenue is derived from the textiles industry, fish and shellfish, vanilla, cloves and other foodstuffs.[176] France is the nation's main trading partner, although the United States, Japan and Germany also have strong economic ties.[97] The Madagascar-U.S. Business Council was formed in May 2003, as a collaboration between USAID and Malagasy artisan producers to support the export of local handicrafts to foreign markets.[193] Imports of such items as foodstuffs, fuel, capital goods, vehicles, consumer goods and electronics consume an estimated 52 percent of GDP.

According to the most recent national census completed in 1993, a majority of the population (52 percent) adhered to indigenous beliefs, with Christianity being the largest single religion at 41 percent, followed by Islam at 7 percent. However, according to the Pew Research Center in 2020, 85% of the population identified as Christian, while just 4.5% practiced folk religions; Protestants comprise a plurality of Christians, followed by Roman Catholics.[215] In contrast, a 2020 study conducted by the Association of Religion Data Archives found 58.1% of the population was Christian, 2.1% Muslim, 39.2% practiced traditional faiths, and 0.6% was nonreligious or adhered to other faiths.[216][47]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe French established trading posts along the east coast in the late 17th century.[46] From about 1774 to 1824, Madagascar gained prominence among pirates and European traders, particularly those involved in the trans-Atlantic slave trade. The small island of Nosy Boroha off the northeastern coast of Madagascar has been proposed by some historians as the site of the legendary pirate utopia of Libertalia.[50] Many European sailors were shipwrecked on the coasts of the island, among them Robert Drury, whose journal is one of the few written depictions of life in southern Madagascar during the 18th century.[51]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUpon arrival, early settlers practiced slash-and-burn agriculture to clear the coastal rainforests for cultivation. The first settlers encountered Madagascar's abundance of megafauna,[38] including 17 species of giant lemurs, the large flightless elephant birds (including possibly the largest bird to ever exist, *Aepyornis maximus*), the giant fossa, and several species of Malagasy hippopotamus, which have since become extinct because of hunting and habitat destruction.[39] By 600 CE, groups of these early settlers had begun clearing the forests of the central highlands.[40]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n214. **^** \"Madagascar: 2007 Constitutional referendum\".

King Andrianjaka founded Antananarivo as the capital of his Imerina Kingdom around 1610 or 1625 upon the site of a captured Vazimba capital on the hilltop of Analamanga.[44] As Merina dominance expanded over neighboring Malagasy peoples in the early 19th century to establish the Kingdom of Madagascar, Antananarivo became the center of administration for virtually the entire island. In 1896 the French colonizers of Madagascar adopted the Merina capital as their center of colonial administration. The city remained the capital of Madagascar after regaining independence in 1960. In 2017, the capital's population was estimated at 1,391,433 inhabitants.[150] The next largest cities are Antsirabe (500,000), Toamasina (450,000) and Mahajanga (400,000).[47]\n\n\n\n### Politics[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Land coverage (left) and topographical (right) maps of Madagascar\nAt 592,800 square kilometres (228,900 sq mi),[47] Madagascar is the world's 46th largest country,[92] the second-largest island country[13] and the fourth-largest island.[47] The country lies mostly between latitudes 12°S and 26°S, and longitudes 43°E and 51°E.[93] Neighboring islands include the French territory of Réunion and the country of Mauritius to the east, as well as the state of Comoros and the French territory of Mayotte to the north west.

According to the constitution, executive power is exercised by the government while legislative power is vested in the ministerial cabinet,[146] the Senate and the National Assembly, although in reality these two latter bodies have very little power or legislative role.

In a map by Muhammad al-Idrisi dating from the year 1154, the island is named *Gesira Malai*, or \"Malay island\" in Arabic. The inversion of this name to *Malai Gesira*, as it was known by the Greeks, is thought to be the precursor of the modern name of the island.[27] The name \"Malay island\" was later rendered in Latin as *Malichu*, an abbreviated form of *Malai Insula*, in the medieval Hereford Mappa Mundi as the name of Madagascar.[28][27]\n\n\nAnother hypothesis is that *Madagascar* is a corrupted transliteration of Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia and an important medieval Indian Ocean port. This would have resulted from 13th-century Venetian explorer Marco Polo confusing the two locations in his memoirs, in which he mentions the land of *Madageiscar* to the south of Socotra. This name would then have been popularized on Renaissance maps by Europeans.[25][26]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n174. **^** \"Madagascar at a glance\" (PDF). World Bank. 25 February 2011.

Rain clouds originating over the Indian Ocean discharge much of their moisture over the island's eastern coast; the heavy precipitation supports the area's rainforest ecosystem. The central highlands are both drier and cooler while the west is drier still, and a semi-arid climate prevails in the southwest and southern interior of the island.[96]\n\n\nTropical cyclones cause damage to infrastructure and local economies as well as loss of life.[46] In 2004, Cyclone Gafilo became the strongest cyclone ever recorded to hit Madagascar. The storm killed 172 people, left 214,260 homeless[98] and caused more than US$250 million in damage.[99] In February 2022, Cyclone Batsirai killed at least 10 people weeks after Cyclone Ana killed 55 and displaced 130,000 people on the island.[100]\n\n\n\n### Ecology[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThere are several rail lines in Madagascar. Antananarivo is connected to Toamasina, Ambatondrazaka and Antsirabe by rail, and another rail line connects Fianarantsoa to Manakara. The most important seaport in Madagascar is located on the east coast at Toamasina. Ports at Mahajanga and Antsiranana are significantly less used because of their remoteness.[46] Madagascar's government hopes to expand the ports of Antsiranana in the north and Taolagnaro in the south, connecting them to improved road networks, since many imports are every day necessities and Madagascar also relies on export money.**[196]**[198][199] The island's newest port at Ehoala, constructed in 2008 and privately managed by Rio Tinto, will come under state control upon completion of the company's mining project near Tôlanaro around 2038.[190] Air Madagascar services the island's many small regional airports, which offer the only practical means of access to many of the more remote regions during rainy season road washouts.[46]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe wealth generated by maritime trade spurred the rise of organized kingdoms on the island, some of which had grown quite powerful by the 17th century.[52] Among these were the Betsimisaraka alliance of the eastern coast and the Sakalava chiefdoms of Menabe and Boina on the west coast. The Kingdom of Imerina, located in the central highlands with its capital at the royal palace of Antananarivo, emerged at around the same time under the leadership of King Andriamanelo.[53]\n\n\n\n### Kingdom of Madagascar[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Merina Kingdom\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe island's elephant birds, a family of endemic giant ratites, became extinct in the 17th century or earlier, most probably because of human hunting of adult birds and poaching of their large eggs for food.[138] Numerous giant lemur species vanished with the arrival of human settlers to the island, while others became extinct over the course of the centuries as a growing human population put greater pressures on lemur habitats and, among some populations, increased the rate of lemur hunting for food.[139] A July 2012 assessment found that the exploitation of natural resources since 2009 has had dire consequences for the island's wildlife: 90 percent of lemur species were found to be threatened with extinction, the highest proportion of any mammalian group. Of these, 23 species were classified as critically endangered. A 2023 study published in *Nature Communications* found that 120 of the 219 mammal species only found on Madagascar are threatened with extinction.[140]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n168. **^** \"United Nations Member States | Meetings Coverage and Press Releases\". *www.un.org*.

Over 300 species of birds have been recorded on the island, of which over 60 percent (including four families and 42 genera) are endemic.[101] The few families and genera of reptiles that have reached Madagascar have diversified into more than 260 species, with over 90 percent of these being endemic[127] (including one endemic family).[101] The island is home to two-thirds of the world's chameleon species,[127] including the smallest known.[128]\n\n\nEndemic fish of Madagascar include two families, 15 genera and over 100 species, primarily inhabiting the island's freshwater lakes and rivers. Although invertebrates remain poorly studied in Madagascar, researchers have found high rates of endemism among the known species. All 651 species of terrestrial snail are endemic, as are a majority of the island's butterflies, scarab beetles, lacewings, spiders, and dragonflies.[101]\n\n\n\n### Environmental issues[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nChinese, Indian and Comoran minorities are present in Madagascar, as well as a small European (primarily French) populace. Emigration in the late 20th century has reduced these minority populations, occasionally in abrupt waves, such as the exodus of Comorans in 1976, following anti-Comoran riots in Mahajanga.[46] By comparison, there has been no significant emigration of Malagasy peoples.[97] The number of Europeans has declined since independence, reduced from 68,430 in 1958[81] to 17,000 three decades later. There were an estimated 25,000 Comorans, 18,000 Indians, and 9,000 Chinese living in Madagascar in the mid-1980s.[46]\n\n\n\n### Largest cities[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n96. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Vences M, Wollenberg KC, Vieites DR, Lees DC (June 2009). \"Madagascar as a model region of species diversification\" (PDF). *Trends in Ecology and Evolution*. **24** (8): 456–465. doi:10.1016/j.tree.2009.03.011.

The country is home to seven terrestrial ecoregions: Madagascar lowland forests, Madagascar subhumid forests, Madagascar dry deciduous forests, Madagascar ericoid thickets, Madagascar spiny forests, Madagascar succulent woodlands, and Madagascar mangroves.[105]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana resulted in the separation of East Gondwana (comprising Madagascar, Antarctica, Australia and the Indian subcontinent) and West Gondwana (Africa–South America) during the Jurassic period, around 185 million years ago. The Indo-Madagascar landmass separated from Antarctica and Australia around 125 million years ago[94] and Madagascar separated from the Indian landmass about 84–92 million years ago during the Late Cretaceous.[95] This long history of separation from other continents has allowed plants and animals on the island to evolve in relative isolation. Along the length of the eastern coast runs a narrow and steep escarpment containing much of the island's remaining tropical lowland forest. To the west of this ridge lies a plateau in the center of the island ranging in altitude from 750 to 1,500 m (2,460 to 4,920 ft) above sea level. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n14. **^** Raval, U.; Veeraswamy, K.

Malagasy and French are both official languages of the state. Christianity is the country's predominant religion, with a significant minority still practicing traditional faiths. Madagascar is classified as a least developed country by the UN.[20] Ecotourism and agriculture, paired with greater investments in education, health and private enterprise, are key elements of its development strategy. Despite substantial economic growth since the early 2000s, income disparities have widened, and quality of life remains low for the majority of the population. Madagascar is experiencing an ongoing famine, which experts argue is the first to be caused entirely by climate change.[21]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n45. **^** Razafimahazo, S.

Although banned by then-President Marc Ravalomanana from 2000 to 2009, the collection of small quantities of precious timber from national parks was re-authorized in January 2009 and dramatically intensified under the administration of Andry Rajoelina as a key source of state revenues to offset cuts in donor support following Ravalomanana's ousting.[136]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nExports formed 28 percent of GDP in 2009.[47] Most of the country's export revenue is derived from the textiles industry, fish and shellfish, vanilla, cloves and other foodstuffs.[176] France is the nation's main trading partner, although the United States, Japan and Germany also have strong economic ties.[97] The Madagascar-U.S. Business Council was formed in May 2003, as a collaboration between USAID and Malagasy artisan producers to support the export of local handicrafts to foreign markets.[193] Imports of such items as foodstuffs, fuel, capital goods, vehicles, consumer goods and electronics consume an estimated 52 percent of GDP.

According to the most recent national census completed in 1993, a majority of the population (52 percent) adhered to indigenous beliefs, with Christianity being the largest single religion at 41 percent, followed by Islam at 7 percent. However, according to the Pew Research Center in 2020, 85% of the population identified as Christian, while just 4.5% practiced folk religions; Protestants comprise a plurality of Christians, followed by Roman Catholics.[215] In contrast, a 2020 study conducted by the Association of Religion Data Archives found 58.1% of the population was Christian, 2.1% Muslim, 39.2% practiced traditional faiths, and 0.6% was nonreligious or adhered to other faiths.[216][47]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe French established trading posts along the east coast in the late 17th century.[46] From about 1774 to 1824, Madagascar gained prominence among pirates and European traders, particularly those involved in the trans-Atlantic slave trade. The small island of Nosy Boroha off the northeastern coast of Madagascar has been proposed by some historians as the site of the legendary pirate utopia of Libertalia.[50] Many European sailors were shipwrecked on the coasts of the island, among them Robert Drury, whose journal is one of the few written depictions of life in southern Madagascar during the 18th century.[51]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUpon arrival, early settlers practiced slash-and-burn agriculture to clear the coastal rainforests for cultivation. The first settlers encountered Madagascar's abundance of megafauna,[38] including 17 species of giant lemurs, the large flightless elephant birds (including possibly the largest bird to ever exist, *Aepyornis maximus*), the giant fossa, and several species of Malagasy hippopotamus, which have since become extinct because of hunting and habitat destruction.[39] By 600 CE, groups of these early settlers had begun clearing the forests of the central highlands.[40]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n214. **^** \"Madagascar: 2007 Constitutional referendum\".

Mount Thor, with an elevation of 1,675 m (5,495 ft), is said to have the greatest purely vertical drop (a sheer cliff face) of any mountain on Earth, at 1,250 m (4,100 ft).[24] Mount Sharat,[25] with an elevation of 422 m (1,385 ft) and a prominence of 67 m (220 ft) is located on Baffin Island. The mountain is named after geologist Sharat Kumar Roy, the chief geology curator in the Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago. Roy, a native of India, studied in India, London, and earned his Ph.D. at the University of Chicago.

Shore birds include the phalarope, various waders (commonly called sandpipers), murres including Brünnich's guillemot, and plovers. Gull species also nest on Baffin Island and they include Sabine's gull,[74] glaucous gull, herring gull and ivory gull.[75][76]\n\n\nLong-range travellers include the Arctic tern, which migrates from Antarctica every spring.

This brings very long, cold winters and foggy, cloudy summers, which have helped to add to the remoteness of the island. Spring thaw arrives much later than normal for a position straddling the Arctic Circle: around early June at Iqaluit in the south-east but around early- to mid-July on the north coast where glaciers run right down to sea level. Snow, even heavy snow, can occur at any time of the year, although it is least likely in July and early August. Average annual temperatures at Iqaluit are around −9.5 °C (14.9 °F), compared with around 5 °C (41 °F) in Reykjavík,[maps 1] which is at a similar latitude.[81]\n\n\nSea ice surrounds the island for most of the year and only disappears completely from the north coast for short, unpredictable periods from mid- to late June until the end of September.[82]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n83. **^** \"Sunrise/sunset calculator\".

They migrate in large pods consisting of a hundred or more seals to within 1–8 km (0.62–4.97 mi) of the shoreline, which they then follow, feeding on crustaceans and fish.[79]\n\n\nWalruses, which do not migrate far off land in the winter. They merely follow the fast ice, or ice that is solidly attached to land, and stay ahead of it as the ice hardens further and further out to sea. As winter progresses, they will always remain where there is open water free of ice. When the ice melts, they move in to land and can be found basking on rocks close to shore. One of the largest walrus herds can be found in the Foxe Basin on the western side of Baffin Island.[80]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n87. **^** \"Iqaluit A\". *Canadian Climate Normals 1981–2010*.

Bjarni appears to be the first European to see Baffin Island, and the first European to see North America beyond Greenland.[31] It was about 15 years later that the Norse Greenlanders, led by Leif Erikson, a son of Erik the Red, started exploring new areas around the year 1000.[31] Baffin Island is thought to be Helluland, and the archaeological site at Tanfield Valley is thought to have been a trading post.[33][34] The Saga of Erik the Red, 1880 translation into English by J. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Arctic wolf and the Baffin Island wolf, a grey wolf subspecies, are also year-round residents of Baffin Island. Unlike the grey wolf in southern climes, Arctic wolves often have smaller social networks, due to the barren landscape and minimal resources, thus resulting in unique hierarchies when compared with wolves found further south. For example, Arctic wolves often do not hunt in packs, although a male-female pair may hunt together. \n\n\n\n![](image)Satellite image of Baffin Island\n![](image)An ice-covered fjord on Baffin Island, with Davis Strait in the background\n### Birds[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWilliam W. Fitzhugh, Director of the Arctic Studies Center at the Smithsonian Institution, and a Senior Scientist at the National Museum of Natural History, wrote that there is insufficient published evidence to support Sutherland's claims, and that the Dorset were using spun cordage by the 6th century.[40] In 1992, Elizabeth Wayland Barber wrote that a piece of three-ply yarn that dates to the Paleolithic era, that ended about 10,000 BP, was found at the Lascaux caves in France. This yarn consisted of three s-twist strands that were z-plied, much like the way a three-ply yarn is made now, the Baffin Island yarn was a simple two-ply yarn.[36] The eight sod buildings and artifacts found in the 1960s at L'Anse aux Meadows, located on the northern tip of Newfoundland Island, remains the only confirmed Norse site in North America outside of those found in Greenland.[41]\n\n\n\n## Administration[edit]\n\n\nBaffin Island is part of the Qikiqtaaluk Region.\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the water (and under the ice), the main year-round species is the ringed seal subspecies, the Arctic ringed seal. It lives offshore within 8 km (5.0 mi) of land. In winter, it makes a number of breathing holes in the ice, up to 2 m (6 ft 7 in) thick. It visits each one often to keep the hole open and free from ice. In March, when a female is ready to whelp, she will enlarge one of the breathing holes that has snow over it, creating a small \"igloo\" where she whelps one or two pups. Within three weeks the pups are in the water and swimming. In summer, some ringed seals keep to a narrow territory about 3 km (1.9 mi) along the shoreline but may move out into the open water. In the spring they spend more time on the surface of the ice.[77]\n\n\n\n#### Summer visitors[edit]\n\n\nWater species that visit Baffin Island in the summer are:\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n61. **^** \"Dewey Soper Migratory Bird Sanctuary\". *Ramsar Sites Information Service*.

The polar bear population here is one of 19 genetically distinct demes of the circumpolar region.[72]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMost of Baffin Island lies north of the Arctic Circle—all communities from Pangnirtung northwards have polar night in winter and midnight sun in summer. The eastern community of Clyde River has twilight instead of night from April 26 until May 13, continuous sunlight for 21⁄2 months from May 14 to July 28, then twilight instead of night from July 29 until August 16. This gives the community just over 31⁄2 months without true night. In the winter, the sun sets on November 22 and does not rise again until January 19 of the next year. Pond Inlet has civil twilight from December 16 to December 26. However, there is twilight for at least 4 hours per day, unlike places such as Eureka.[83]\n\n\nLike most of Nunavut and the Canadian Arctic, Baffin Island has a tundra climate (Köppen climate classification *ET*), although the highest ice caps have an ice cap climate (*EF*). The sea is frozen for most of the year, and only a few months are above freezing. There can be seasonal lag in spring.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n55. **^** \"Aboriginal Population Profile, 2016 Census Pangnirtung, Hamlet [Census subdivision], Nunavut\". June 19, 2019.

Mount Thor, with an elevation of 1,675 m (5,495 ft), is said to have the greatest purely vertical drop (a sheer cliff face) of any mountain on Earth, at 1,250 m (4,100 ft).[24] Mount Sharat,[25] with an elevation of 422 m (1,385 ft) and a prominence of 67 m (220 ft) is located on Baffin Island. The mountain is named after geologist Sharat Kumar Roy, the chief geology curator in the Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago. Roy, a native of India, studied in India, London, and earned his Ph.D. at the University of Chicago. Shortly after he started at the Field Museum he joined the 1927–1928 Rawson-Macmillan Expedition to Baffin Island and Labrador. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. **^** \"The Atlas of Canada - Search\". *archive.is*.

This brings very long, cold winters and foggy, cloudy summers, which have helped to add to the remoteness of the island. Spring thaw arrives much later than normal for a position straddling the Arctic Circle: around early June at Iqaluit in the south-east but around early- to mid-July on the north coast where glaciers run right down to sea level. Snow, even heavy snow, can occur at any time of the year, although it is least likely in July and early August. Average annual temperatures at Iqaluit are around −9.5 °C (14.9 °F), compared with around 5 °C (41 °F) in Reykjavík,[maps 1] which is at a similar latitude.[81]\n\n\nSea ice surrounds the island for most of the year and only disappears completely from the north coast for short, unpredictable periods from mid- to late June until the end of September.[82]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n83. **^** \"Sunrise/sunset calculator\".

They merely follow the fast ice, or ice that is solidly attached to land, and stay ahead of it as the ice hardens further and further out to sea. As winter progresses, they will always remain where there is open water free of ice. When the ice melts, they move in to land and can be found basking on rocks close to shore.

Bjarni appears to be the first European to see Baffin Island, and the first European to see North America beyond Greenland.[31] It was about 15 years later that the Norse Greenlanders, led by Leif Erikson, a son of Erik the Red, started exploring new areas around the year 1000.[31] Baffin Island is thought to be Helluland, and the archaeological site at Tanfield Valley is thought to have been a trading post.[33][34] The Saga of Erik the Red, 1880 translation into English by J. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Arctic wolf and the Baffin Island wolf, a grey wolf subspecies, are also year-round residents of Baffin Island. Unlike the grey wolf in southern climes, Arctic wolves often have smaller social networks, due to the barren landscape and minimal resources, thus resulting in unique hierarchies when compared with wolves found further south. For example, Arctic wolves often do not hunt in packs, although a male-female pair may hunt together. \n\n\n\n![](image)Satellite image of Baffin Island\n![](image)An ice-covered fjord on Baffin Island, with Davis Strait in the background\n### Birds[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWilliam W. Fitzhugh, Director of the Arctic Studies Center at the Smithsonian Institution, and a Senior Scientist at the National Museum of Natural History, wrote that there is insufficient published evidence to support Sutherland's claims, and that the Dorset were using spun cordage by the 6th century.[40] In 1992, Elizabeth Wayland Barber wrote that a piece of three-ply yarn that dates to the Paleolithic era, that ended about 10,000 BP, was found at the Lascaux caves in France. This yarn consisted of three s-twist strands that were z-plied, much like the way a three-ply yarn is made now, the Baffin Island yarn was a simple two-ply yarn.[36] The eight sod buildings and artifacts found in the 1960s at L'Anse aux Meadows, located on the northern tip of Newfoundland Island, remains the only confirmed Norse site in North America outside of those found in Greenland.[41]\n\n\n\n## Administration[edit]\n\n\nBaffin Island is part of the Qikiqtaaluk Region.\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the water (and under the ice), the main year-round species is the ringed seal subspecies, the Arctic ringed seal. It lives offshore within 8 km (5.0 mi) of land. In winter, it makes a number of breathing holes in the ice, up to 2 m (6 ft 7 in) thick. It visits each one often to keep the hole open and free from ice. In March, when a female is ready to whelp, she will enlarge one of the breathing holes that has snow over it, creating a small \"igloo\" where she whelps one or two pups. Within three weeks the pups are in the water and swimming. In summer, some ringed seals keep to a narrow territory about 3 km (1.9 mi) along the shoreline but may move out into the open water. In the spring they spend more time on the surface of the ice.[77]\n\n\n\n#### Summer visitors[edit]\n\n\nWater species that visit Baffin Island in the summer are:\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n61. **^** \"Dewey Soper Migratory Bird Sanctuary\". *Ramsar Sites Information Service*.

Polar bears mate approximately every year, bearing one to three cubs around March. Female polar bears may travel 10–20 km (6.2–12.4 mi) inland to find a large snow bank where they dig a den in which to spend the winter and later give birth. The polar bear population here is one of 19 genetically distinct demes of the circumpolar region.[72]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMost of Baffin Island lies north of the Arctic Circle—all communities from Pangnirtung northwards have polar night in winter and midnight sun in summer. The eastern community of Clyde River has twilight instead of night from April 26 until May 13, continuous sunlight for 21⁄2 months from May 14 to July 28, then twilight instead of night from July 29 until August 16. This gives the community just over 31⁄2 months without true night. In the winter, the sun sets on November 22 and does not rise again until January 19 of the next year. Pond Inlet has civil twilight from December 16 to December 26. However, there is twilight for at least 4 hours per day, unlike places such as Eureka.[83]\n\n\nLike most of Nunavut and the Canadian Arctic, Baffin Island has a tundra climate (Köppen climate classification *ET*), although the highest ice caps have an ice cap climate (*EF*). The sea is frozen for most of the year, and only a few months are above freezing. There can be seasonal lag in spring.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n55. **^** \"Aboriginal Population Profile, 2016 Census Pangnirtung, Hamlet [Census subdivision], Nunavut\". June 19, 2019.

It is the largest island that is fully within Indonesian territory, as well as the sixth-largest island in the world at 475,807.63 km2 (182,812 mi.2), including adjacent islands such as the Simeulue, Nias, Mentawai, Enggano, Riau Islands, Bangka Belitung and Krakatoa archipelago.\n\n\nSumatra is an elongated landmass spanning a diagonal northwest–southeast axis. The Indian Ocean borders the northwest, west, and southwest coasts of Sumatra, with the island chain of Simeulue, Nias, Mentawai, and Enggano off the western coast. In the northeast, the narrow Strait of Malacca separates the island from the Malay Peninsula, which is an extension of the Eurasian continent. In the southeast, the narrow Sunda Strait, containing the Krakatoa Archipelago, separates Sumatra from Java. The northern tip of Sumatra is near the Andaman Islands, while off the southeastern coast lie the islands of Bangka and Belitung, Karimata Strait and the Java Sea. The Bukit Barisan mountains, which contain several active volcanoes, form the backbone of the island, while the northeastern area contains large plains and lowlands with swamps, mangrove forest and complex river systems. The equator crosses the island at its centre in West Sumatra and Riau provinces. The climate of the island is tropical, hot, and humid. Lush tropical rain forest once dominated the landscape.\n\n\nSumatra has a wide range of plant and animal species but has lost almost 50% of its tropical rainforest in the last 35 years.[*clarification needed*] Many species are now critically endangered, such as the Sumatran ground cuckoo, the Sumatran tiger, the Sumatran elephant, the Sumatran rhinoceros, and the Sumatran orangutan. Deforestation on the island has also resulted in serious seasonal smoke haze over neighbouring countries, such as the 2013 Southeast Asian haze which caused considerable tensions between Indonesia and affected countries Malaysia and Singapore.[2] The widespread deforestation and other environmental destruction in Sumatra and other parts of Indonesia has often been described by academics as an ecocide.[3][4][5][6][7]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nSumatra was known in ancient times by the Sanskrit names of *Suwarnadwīpa* ('Island of Gold') and *Suwarnabhūmi* ('Land of Gold'), because of the gold deposits in the island's highlands.[8] The earliest known mention of the current form \"Sumatra\" was in 1017, when the local king Haji Sumatrabhumi (\"king of the land of Sumatra\")[9] sent an envoy to China. Arab geographers referred to the island as *Lamri* (*Lamuri*, *Lambri* or *Ramni*) in the tenth through thirteenth centuries, in reference to a kingdom near modern-day Banda Aceh which was the first landfall for traders. The island has also been known by other names, including *Andalas*[10] or *Percha Island*.[11]\n\n\nIn the late 13th century, Marco Polo referred to the kingdom as *Samara*, while his contemporary fellow Italian traveller Odoric of Pordenone used the form *Sumoltra*. Later in the 14th century the local form \"Sumatra\" became popular abroad due to the rising power of the kingdom of Samudera Pasai and the subsequent Sultanate of Aceh.[12][13]\n\n\nFrom then on, subsequent European writers mostly used *Sumatra* or similar forms of the name for the entire island.[14][15]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Batak warriors, 1870\nBy the year 692, the Melayu Kingdom was absorbed by Srivijaya.[16]: 79–80 Srivijaya's influence waned in the 11th century, specifically in the year 1025, after suffering defeat at the hands of the Chola Empire in southern India[17] By the end of the 12th century, Srivijaya had been reduced to a kingdom, and its dominant role in South Sumatra ended with the last king, Ratu Sekekhummong, who founded the milestone of Kepaksian Sekala Brak in the 13th century AD with the Dalom building.[17][18] At the same time, the spread of Islam in Indonesia occurred gradually and indirectly, starting from the western regions of Indonesia such as the Sumatra area which became the first place for the spread of Islam in the archipelago then Java to the eastern regions of Indonesia, Sulawesi and Maluku.[19] The island of Sumatra is also an area in the archipelago that received the spread of Islam first compared to other islands or other areas.[19] The island of Sumatra became the first area to receive the spread of Islam because of the position of the island of Sumatra which is close to the Malacca strait.[19] The initial process of Islamization related to trade and also the formation of the kingdom.[19] Islam entered Sumatra through pious Arabs and Tamil traders in the 6th and 7th centuries AD.[20][21][22] p.129 n.42</ref> At the beginning and end of the 13th century the formation of the kingdom, the king of the Samudra kingdom had converted to Islam. Marco Polo visited the island in 1292, and his fellow Italian Odoric of Pordenone in 1321.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Baiturrahman Grand Mosque in Banda Aceh\n![](image)Kesawan Road in Medan, circa 1900\nAceh in the north of Sumatra became known in the 16th century as trading centre for the pepper trade by shipping quality piperaceae (*pepper*). Aceh became the main commercial centre of the Aceh Sultanate and trading routes were established to the Mediterranean via the Red Sea to rival the Portuguese shipping lanes. The reign of Iskandar Muda is known as the *golden age* of Sumatra because he extended the cultural influence of the Aceh Sultanate to Padang and Johor.[23] The Aceh Sultanate sustained the rivalry with the Johor sultanate, the Dutch, and the Portuguese throughout the 16th and 17th century. When the Dutch were weakened in the 18th century the British empire began to actively intervene in Aceh, establishing close relations between Banda Aceh and Penang. In the 17th and 18th century the Aceh Sultanate battled the Siak sultanate in the south of Sumatra. The port city of Banda Aceh was recorded in European historical writings since the 13th century. In terms of economic development the port of Banda Aceh only started to face competition in the 18th century when more ports were constructed in Sumatra for maritime transport. Nevertheless, major pepper suppliers used the port of Banda Aceh at the beginning of the 19th century. The port in Medan grew swiftly in the late 19th and early 20th century. Meanwhile the medium sized port of Palembang faced a stiff economic decline as the heritage of the Srivijaya empire was superseded by the economic policy of the Singhasari and Majapahit. The Palembang sultanate experienced a terminal decline in the early 19th century.[24]\n\n\nWith the coming of the Dutch Empire, the many Sumatran princely states gradually fell under their control. Aceh posed major obstacles, as the Dutch were involved in the long and costly Aceh War (1873–1903).\n\n\nThe Free Aceh Movement fought against Indonesian government forces in the Aceh Insurgency from 1976 to 2005.[25] Security crackdowns in 2001 and 2002 resulted in several thousand civilian deaths.[26]\n\n\nThe island was heavily impacted by both the 1883 Krakatoa eruption and the 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami.\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1971  | 20,808,148 | —     |\n| 1980  | 28,016,160 | +34.6% |\n| 1990  | 36,506,703 | +30.3% |\n| 1995  | 40,830,334 | +11.8% |\n| 2000  | 42,616,164 | +4.4% |\n| 2005  | 45,839,041 | +7.6% |\n| 2010  | 50,613,947 | +10.4% |\n| 2015  | 55,198,752 | +9.1% |\n| 2020  | 58,557,211 | +6.1% |\n| 2022  | 59,977,300 | +2.4% |\n| sources:[27][28] |\n\n\nSumatra is not particularly densely populated, with an average of about 126 people per km2 – about 59,977,300  people in total (according to official estimates as at mid 2022).[29] Because of its size, it is nonetheless the fifth[30] most populous island in the world.\n\n\n\n* ![Minangkabau women carrying platters of food to a ceremony](image)\n\nMinangkabau women carrying platters of food to a ceremony\n* ![Traditional house in Simalungun North Sumatra](image)\n\nTraditional house in Simalungun North Sumatra\n\n## Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nThe largest indigenous ethnic groups in Sumatra are Malays, Minangkabaus, Bataks, Acehnese, and Lampungs. Other major non-indigenous ethnic groups are Javanese, Sundanese, and Chinese.\n\n\nBelow are 11 largest ethnic groups in Sumatra based on the 2010 census (including Riau Islands, Bangka Belitung, Nias, Mentawai, Simeulue and islands around it)[31]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Ethnic groups\n | Population\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Javanese | 15,239,275\n |\n| Bataks | 7,302,330\n |\n| Minangkabau | 5,799,001\n |\n| Ethnic groups from South Sumatera\n | 4,826,272\n |\n| Malays | 4,016,182\n |\n| Ethnic groups from Aceh\n | 3,991,883\n |\n| Ethnic groups from Jambi\n | 1,379,351\n |\n| Sundanese | 1,231,888\n |\n| Ethnic groups from Lampung\n | 1,109,601\n |\n| Nias | 1,021,267\n |\n| Other\n | 2,086,804\n |\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nSpeakers of Acehnese.\nThere are over 52 languages spoken, all of which (except Chinese and Tamil) belong to the Malayo-Polynesian branch of the Austronesian language family. Within Malayo-Polynesian, they are divided into several sub-branches: Chamic (which are represented by Acehnese in which its closest relatives are languages spoken by Ethnic Chams in Cambodia and Vietnam), Malayic (Malay, Minangkabau and other closely related languages), Northwest Sumatra–Barrier Islands (Batak languages, Gayo and others), Lampungic (includes Proper Lampung and Komering) and Bornean (represented by Rejang in which its closest linguistic relatives are Bukar Sadong and Land Dayak spoken in West Kalimantan and Sarawak (Malaysia)). Northwest Sumatra–Barrier Islands and Lampungic branches are endemic to the island. Like all parts of Indonesia, Indonesian (which was based on Riau Malay) is the official language and the main lingua franca. Although Sumatra has its own local lingua franca, variants of Malay like Medan Malay and Palembang Malay[32] are popular in North and South Sumatra, especially in urban areas. Minangkabau (Padang dialect)[33] is popular in West Sumatra, some parts of North Sumatra, Bengkulu, Jambi and Riau (especially in Pekanbaru and areas bordered with West Sumatra) while Acehnese is also used as an inter-ethnic means of communication in some parts of Aceh province.\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nReligion in Sumatra (2022)[34]\n\n\n\nIslam (87.32%)\nProtestantism (9.21%)\nRoman Catholic (1.68%)\nBuddhism (1.39%)\nHinduism (0.32%)\nConfucianism (0.061%)\nFolk religion (0.02%)\n\nThe majority of people in Sumatra are Muslims (87.1%), while 10.7% are Christians, and less than 2% are Buddhists and Hindus.[35]\n\n\n\n## Administration[edit]\n\n\nSumatra is one of seven geographical regions of Indonesia, which includes its adjacent smaller islands. Sumatra was one of the eight original provinces of Indonesia between 1945 and 1948. Including adjacent archipelagoes normally included with Sumatra (such as the Riau Islands, Nias and the Bangka-Belitung group), it now covers ten of Indonesia's 37 provinces, which are set out below with their areas and populations.[36]\n\n\n\n\n\nProvinces within the region of Sumatra\n| Name | Area (km2) | Populationcensus2000 | Populationcensus2010 | Populationcensus2015 | Populationcensus2020 | Populationestimate2022 | Capital\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Aceh | 56,834.75 | 4,073,006 | 4,486,570 | 4,993,385 | 5,274,871 | 5,407,900 | Banda Aceh |\n| ![](image) North Sumatra (*Sumatra Utara*) | 72,460.74 | 11,642,488 | 12,326,678 | 13,923,262 | 14,799,361 | 15,115,200 | Medan |\n| ![](image) West Sumatra (*Sumatra Barat*) | 42,119.54 | 4,248,515 | 4,846,909 | 5,190,577 | 5,534,472 | 5,640,600 | Padang |\n| ![](image) Riau | 89,935.90 | 3,907,763 | 5,543,031 | 6,330,941 | 6,394,097 | 6,614,400 | Pekanbaru |\n| ![](image) Riau Islands (*Kepulauan Riau*) | 8,269.71 | 1,040,207 | 1,685,698 | 1,968,313 | 2,064,564 | 2,179,800 | Tanjung Pinang |\n| ![](image) Jambi | 49,026.58 | 2,407,166 | 3,088,618 | 3,397,164 | 3,548,228 | 3,631,100 | Jambi |\n| ![](image) South Sumatra  (*Sumatra Selatan*) | 86,771.68 | 6,210,800 | 7,446,401 | 8,043,042 | 8,467,432 | 8,657,000 | Palembang |\n| ![](image) Bengkulu | 20,128.34 | 1,455,500 | 1,713,393 | 1,872,136 | 2,010,670 | 2,060,100 | Bengkulu |\n| ![](image) Lampung | 33,570.26 | 6,730,751 | 7,596,115 | 8,109,601 | 9,007,848 | 9,176,600 | Bandar Lampung |\n| ![](image) Bangka Belitung Islands  (*Kepulauan Bangka Belitung*) | 16,690.13 | 899,968 | 1,223,048 | 1,370,331 | 1,455,678 | 1,494,600 | Pangkal Pinang |\n| ***Totals*** | 475,807.63 | 42,616,164 | 50,613,947 | 55,198,752 | 58,557,211 | 59,977,300\n |\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of geological formation of Sumatra island\n![](image)Mount Sinabung, North Sumatra\nThe longest axis of the island runs approximately 1,790 km (1,110 mi) northwest–southeast, crossing the equator near the centre. At its widest point, the island spans 435 km (270 mi). The interior of the island is dominated by two geographical regions: the Barisan Mountains in the west and swampy plains in the east. Sumatra is the closest Indonesian island to mainland Asia.\n\n\nTo the southeast is Java, separated by the Sunda Strait. To the north is the Malay Peninsula (located on the Asian mainland), separated by the Strait of Malacca. To the east is Borneo, across the Karimata Strait. West of the island is the Indian Ocean.\n\n\nThe Great Sumatran fault (a strike-slip fault), and the Sunda megathrust (a subduction zone), run the entire length of the island along its west coast. On 26 December 2004, the western coast and islands of Sumatra, particularly Aceh province, were struck by a tsunami following the Indian Ocean earthquake. This was the longest earthquake recorded, lasting between 500 and 600 seconds (8.33–10 minutes).[37] More than 170,000 Indonesians were killed, primarily in Aceh. Other recent earthquakes to strike Sumatra include the 2005 Nias–Simeulue earthquake and the 2010 Mentawai earthquake and tsunami.\n\n\nLake Toba is the site of a supervolcanic eruption that occurred around 74,000 years ago, representing a climate-changing event.[38] The most important rivers in Sumatra belong to the catchment area of the South China Sea. Heading north to south, the Asahan, Rokan, Siak, Kampar, Indragiri, Batanghari flow into the Malacca Strait, while the island's largest river, the Musi, flows into the sea at Bangka Strait in the south. To the east, big rivers carry silt from the mountains, forming the vast lowland interspersed by swamps. Even if mostly unsuitable for farming, the area is currently of great economic importance for Indonesia. It produces oil from both above and below the soil – palm oil and petroleum.\n\n\nSumatra is the largest producer of Indonesian coffee. Small-holders grow Arabica coffee (*Coffea arabica*) in the highlands, while Robusta (*Coffea canephora*) is found in the lowlands. Arabica coffee from the regions of Gayo, Lintong and Sidikilang is typically processed using the Giling Basah (wet hulling) technique, which gives it a heavy body and low acidity.[39]\n\n\nSumatra is a highly seismic island. Huge earthquakes have been recorded throughout history. In 1797, an 8.9 earthquake shook Western Sumatra, and in 1833, a 9.2 earthquake shook Bengkulu and Western Sumatra. Both events caused large tsunamis. Earthquakes are very common throughout the coastal area of the west and center of the island, and tsunamis are common due to the high seismicity in the area.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Largest cities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Medan, the largest city in Sumatra\nBy population, Medan is the largest city in Sumatra.[40] Medan is also the most visited and developed city in Sumatra.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | City\n | Province\n | City Birthday\n | Area (in km2)\n | Population  2010 census\n | Population  2020 census\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | **Medan** | North Sumatra | 1 July 1590\n | 265.10\n | 2,097,610\n | 2,435,252\n |\n| 2\n | **Palembang** | South Sumatra | 17 June 683\n | 400.61\n | 1,455,284\n | 1,668,848\n |\n| 3\n | **Bandar Lampung** | Lampung | 17 June 1682\n | 169.21\n | 881,801\n | 1,166,066\n |\n| 4\n | **Pekanbaru** | Riau | 23 June 1784\n | 633.01\n | 897,767\n | 983,356\n |\n| 5\n | **Padang** | West Sumatra | 7 August 1669\n | 694.96\n | 833,562\n | 909,040\n |\n| 6\n | **Jambi** | Jambi | 17 May 1946\n | 205.00\n | 531,857\n | 606,200\n |\n| 7\n | **Bengkulu** | Bengkulu | 18 March 1719\n | 144.52\n | 308,544\n | 373,591\n |\n| 8\n | **Dumai** | Riau | 20 April 1999\n | 2,039.35\n | 253,803\n | 316,782\n |\n| 9\n | **Binjai** | North Sumatra |  | 90.24\n | 246,154\n | 291,842\n |\n| 10\n | **Pematang Siantar** | North Sumatra | 24 April 1871\n | 60.52\n | 234,698\n | 268,254\n |\n| 11\n | **Banda Aceh** | Aceh | 22 April 1205\n | 61.36\n | 223,446\n | 252,899\n |\n| 12\n | **Lubuklinggau** | South Sumatra | 17 August 2001\n | 419.80\n | 201,308\n | 234,166\n |\n\n\n## Flora and fauna[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of national parks of Indonesia and List of amphibians of Sumatra\n\n![](image)Sumatran tiger\n![](image)*Rafflesia arnoldii*\nSumatra supports a wide range of vegetation types that are home to a rich variety of species, including 17 endemic genera of plants.[41] Unique species include the Sumatran pine which dominates the Sumatran tropical pine forests of the higher mountainsides in the north of the island and rainforest plants such as *Rafflesia arnoldii* (the world's largest individual flower), and the titan arum (the world's largest unbranched inflorescence).\n\n\nThe island is home to 201 mammal species and 580 bird species. There are nine endemic mammal species on mainland Sumatra and 14 more endemic to the nearby Mentawai Islands.[41] There are about 300 freshwater fish species in Sumatra.[42] There are 93 amphibian species in Sumatra, 21 of which are endemic to Sumatra.[43]\n\n\nThe Sumatran tiger, Sumatran rhinoceros, Sumatran elephant, Sumatran ground cuckoo, Sumatran orangutan and Tapanuli orangutan are all critically endangered, indicating the highest level of threat to their survival. In October 2008, the Indonesian government announced a plan to protect Sumatra's remaining forests.[44]\n\n\nThe island includes more than 10 national parks, including three which are listed as the Tropical Rainforest Heritage of Sumatra World Heritage Site – Gunung Leuser National Park, Kerinci Seblat National Park and Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park. The Berbak National Park is one of three national parks in Indonesia listed as a wetland of international importance under the Ramsar Convention.\n\n\nSumatra has lost almost 50% of its tropical rainforest in the last 35 years.[*clarification needed*] Many species are now critically endangered, such as the Sumatran ground cuckoo, the Sumatran tiger, the Sumatran elephant, the Sumatran rhinoceros, and the Sumatran orangutan. Deforestation on the island has also resulted in serious seasonal smoke haze over neighbouring countries, such as the 2013 Southeast Asian haze which caused considerable tensions between Indonesia and affected countries Malaysia and Singapore.[2] The widespread deforestation and other environmental destruction in Sumatra and other parts of Indonesia has often been described by academics as an ecocide.[3][4][5][6]\n\n\n\n## Rail transport[edit]\n\n\nSeveral unconnected railway networks built during Netherlands East Indies exist in Sumatra, such as the ones connecting Banda Aceh-Lhokseumawe-Besitang-Medan-Tebingtinggi-Pematang Siantar-Rantau Prapat in Northern Sumatra (the Banda Aceh-Besitang section was closed in 1971, but is currently being rebuilt).[45] Padang-Solok-Bukittinggi in West Sumatra, and Bandar Lampung-Palembang-Lahat-Lubuk Linggau in Southern Sumatra.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Indonesia portal\n* ![icon](image)Islands portal\n\n\n* Architecture of Sumatra\n* Bukit Seguntang\n* Communism in Sumatra\n* Music of Sumatra\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The *Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia* states that *Sumatra* is the correct spelling in Indonesian;[1] however, it is popularly and legislatively spelled in Indonesian as *Sumatera*.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Hasil Pencarian – KBBI Daring\" [Entry for \"Sumatra\" in the online version of the *Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia*]. *kbbi.kemdikbud.go.id* (in Indonesian).

It is the largest island that is fully within Indonesian territory, as well as the sixth-largest island in the world at 475,807.63 km2 (182,812 mi.2), including adjacent islands such as the Simeulue, Nias, Mentawai, Enggano, Riau Islands, Bangka Belitung and Krakatoa archipelago.\n\n\nSumatra is an elongated landmass spanning a diagonal northwest–southeast axis. The Indian Ocean borders the northwest, west, and southwest coasts of Sumatra, with the island chain of Simeulue, Nias, Mentawai, and Enggano off the western coast. In the northeast, the narrow Strait of Malacca separates the island from the Malay Peninsula, which is an extension of the Eurasian continent. In the southeast, the narrow Sunda Strait, containing the Krakatoa Archipelago, separates Sumatra from Java. The northern tip of Sumatra is near the Andaman Islands, while off the southeastern coast lie the islands of Bangka and Belitung, Karimata Strait and the Java Sea. The Bukit Barisan mountains, which contain several active volcanoes, form the backbone of the island, while the northeastern area contains large plains and lowlands with swamps, mangrove forest and complex river systems. The equator crosses the island at its centre in West Sumatra and Riau provinces. The climate of the island is tropical, hot, and humid. Lush tropical rain forest once dominated the landscape.\n\n\nSumatra has a wide range of plant and animal species but has lost almost 50% of its tropical rainforest in the last 35 years.[*clarification needed*] Many species are now critically endangered, such as the Sumatran ground cuckoo, the Sumatran tiger, the Sumatran elephant, the Sumatran rhinoceros, and the Sumatran orangutan. Deforestation on the island has also resulted in serious seasonal smoke haze over neighbouring countries, such as the 2013 Southeast Asian haze which caused considerable tensions between Indonesia and affected countries Malaysia and Singapore.[2] The widespread deforestation and other environmental destruction in Sumatra and other parts of Indonesia has often been described by academics as an ecocide.[3][4][5][6][7]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nSumatra was known in ancient times by the Sanskrit names of *Suwarnadwīpa* ('Island of Gold') and *Suwarnabhūmi* ('Land of Gold'), because of the gold deposits in the island's highlands.[8] The earliest known mention of the current form \"Sumatra\" was in 1017, when the local king Haji Sumatrabhumi (\"king of the land of Sumatra\")[9] sent an envoy to China. Arab geographers referred to the island as *Lamri* (*Lamuri*, *Lambri* or *Ramni*) in the tenth through thirteenth centuries, in reference to a kingdom near modern-day Banda Aceh which was the first landfall for traders. The island has also been known by other names, including *Andalas*[10] or *Percha Island*.[11]\n\n\nIn the late 13th century, Marco Polo referred to the kingdom as *Samara*, while his contemporary fellow Italian traveller Odoric of Pordenone used the form *Sumoltra*. Later in the 14th century the local form \"Sumatra\" became popular abroad due to the rising power of the kingdom of Samudera Pasai and the subsequent Sultanate of Aceh.[12][13]\n\n\nFrom then on, subsequent European writers mostly used *Sumatra* or similar forms of the name for the entire island.[14][15]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Batak warriors, 1870\nBy the year 692, the Melayu Kingdom was absorbed by Srivijaya.[16]: 79–80 Srivijaya's influence waned in the 11th century, specifically in the year 1025, after suffering defeat at the hands of the Chola Empire in southern India[17] By the end of the 12th century, Srivijaya had been reduced to a kingdom, and its dominant role in South Sumatra ended with the last king, Ratu Sekekhummong, who founded the milestone of Kepaksian Sekala Brak in the 13th century AD with the Dalom building.[17][18] At the same time, the spread of Islam in Indonesia occurred gradually and indirectly, starting from the western regions of Indonesia such as the Sumatra area which became the first place for the spread of Islam in the archipelago then Java to the eastern regions of Indonesia, Sulawesi and Maluku.[19] The island of Sumatra is also an area in the archipelago that received the spread of Islam first compared to other islands or other areas.[19] The island of Sumatra became the first area to receive the spread of Islam because of the position of the island of Sumatra which is close to the Malacca strait.[19] The initial process of Islamization related to trade and also the formation of the kingdom.[19] Islam entered Sumatra through pious Arabs and Tamil traders in the 6th and 7th centuries AD.[20][21][22] p.129 n.42</ref> At the beginning and end of the 13th century the formation of the kingdom, the king of the Samudra kingdom had converted to Islam. Marco Polo visited the island in 1292, and his fellow Italian Odoric of Pordenone in 1321.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Baiturrahman Grand Mosque in Banda Aceh\n![](image)Kesawan Road in Medan, circa 1900\nAceh in the north of Sumatra became known in the 16th century as trading centre for the pepper trade by shipping quality piperaceae (*pepper*). Aceh became the main commercial centre of the Aceh Sultanate and trading routes were established to the Mediterranean via the Red Sea to rival the Portuguese shipping lanes. The reign of Iskandar Muda is known as the *golden age* of Sumatra because he extended the cultural influence of the Aceh Sultanate to Padang and Johor.[23] The Aceh Sultanate sustained the rivalry with the Johor sultanate, the Dutch, and the Portuguese throughout the 16th and 17th century. When the Dutch were weakened in the 18th century the British empire began to actively intervene in Aceh, establishing close relations between Banda Aceh and Penang. In the 17th and 18th century the Aceh Sultanate battled the Siak sultanate in the south of Sumatra. The port city of Banda Aceh was recorded in European historical writings since the 13th century. In terms of economic development the port of Banda Aceh only started to face competition in the 18th century when more ports were constructed in Sumatra for maritime transport. Nevertheless, major pepper suppliers used the port of Banda Aceh at the beginning of the 19th century. The port in Medan grew swiftly in the late 19th and early 20th century. Meanwhile the medium sized port of Palembang faced a stiff economic decline as the heritage of the Srivijaya empire was superseded by the economic policy of the Singhasari and Majapahit. The Palembang sultanate experienced a terminal decline in the early 19th century.[24]\n\n\nWith the coming of the Dutch Empire, the many Sumatran princely states gradually fell under their control. Aceh posed major obstacles, as the Dutch were involved in the long and costly Aceh War (1873–1903).\n\n\nThe Free Aceh Movement fought against Indonesian government forces in the Aceh Insurgency from 1976 to 2005.[25] Security crackdowns in 2001 and 2002 resulted in several thousand civilian deaths.[26]\n\n\nThe island was heavily impacted by both the 1883 Krakatoa eruption and the 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami.\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1971  | 20,808,148 | —     |\n| 1980  | 28,016,160 | +34.6% |\n| 1990  | 36,506,703 | +30.3% |\n| 1995  | 40,830,334 | +11.8% |\n| 2000  | 42,616,164 | +4.4% |\n| 2005  | 45,839,041 | +7.6% |\n| 2010  | 50,613,947 | +10.4% |\n| 2015  | 55,198,752 | +9.1% |\n| 2020  | 58,557,211 | +6.1% |\n| 2022  | 59,977,300 | +2.4% |\n| sources:[27][28] |\n\n\nSumatra is not particularly densely populated, with an average of about 126 people per km2 – about 59,977,300  people in total (according to official estimates as at mid 2022).[29] Because of its size, it is nonetheless the fifth[30] most populous island in the world.\n\n\n\n* ![Minangkabau women carrying platters of food to a ceremony](image)\n\nMinangkabau women carrying platters of food to a ceremony\n* ![Traditional house in Simalungun North Sumatra](image)\n\nTraditional house in Simalungun North Sumatra\n\n## Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nThe largest indigenous ethnic groups in Sumatra are Malays, Minangkabaus, Bataks, Acehnese, and Lampungs. Other major non-indigenous ethnic groups are Javanese, Sundanese, and Chinese.\n\n\nBelow are 11 largest ethnic groups in Sumatra based on the 2010 census (including Riau Islands, Bangka Belitung, Nias, Mentawai, Simeulue and islands around it)[31]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Ethnic groups\n | Population\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Javanese | 15,239,275\n |\n| Bataks | 7,302,330\n |\n| Minangkabau | 5,799,001\n |\n| Ethnic groups from South Sumatera\n | 4,826,272\n |\n| Malays | 4,016,182\n |\n| Ethnic groups from Aceh\n | 3,991,883\n |\n| Ethnic groups from Jambi\n | 1,379,351\n |\n| Sundanese | 1,231,888\n |\n| Ethnic groups from Lampung\n | 1,109,601\n |\n| Nias | 1,021,267\n |\n| Other\n | 2,086,804\n |\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nSpeakers of Acehnese.\nThere are over 52 languages spoken, all of which (except Chinese and Tamil) belong to the Malayo-Polynesian branch of the Austronesian language family. Within Malayo-Polynesian, they are divided into several sub-branches: Chamic (which are represented by Acehnese in which its closest relatives are languages spoken by Ethnic Chams in Cambodia and Vietnam), Malayic (Malay, Minangkabau and other closely related languages), Northwest Sumatra–Barrier Islands (Batak languages, Gayo and others), Lampungic (includes Proper Lampung and Komering) and Bornean (represented by Rejang in which its closest linguistic relatives are Bukar Sadong and Land Dayak spoken in West Kalimantan and Sarawak (Malaysia)). Northwest Sumatra–Barrier Islands and Lampungic branches are endemic to the island. Like all parts of Indonesia, Indonesian (which was based on Riau Malay) is the official language and the main lingua franca. Although Sumatra has its own local lingua franca, variants of Malay like Medan Malay and Palembang Malay[32] are popular in North and South Sumatra, especially in urban areas. Minangkabau (Padang dialect)[33] is popular in West Sumatra, some parts of North Sumatra, Bengkulu, Jambi and Riau (especially in Pekanbaru and areas bordered with West Sumatra) while Acehnese is also used as an inter-ethnic means of communication in some parts of Aceh province.\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nReligion in Sumatra (2022)[34]\n\n\n\nIslam (87.32%)\nProtestantism (9.21%)\nRoman Catholic (1.68%)\nBuddhism (1.39%)\nHinduism (0.32%)\nConfucianism (0.061%)\nFolk religion (0.02%)\n\nThe majority of people in Sumatra are Muslims (87.1%), while 10.7% are Christians, and less than 2% are Buddhists and Hindus.[35]\n\n\n\n## Administration[edit]\n\n\nSumatra is one of seven geographical regions of Indonesia, which includes its adjacent smaller islands. Sumatra was one of the eight original provinces of Indonesia between 1945 and 1948. Including adjacent archipelagoes normally included with Sumatra (such as the Riau Islands, Nias and the Bangka-Belitung group), it now covers ten of Indonesia's 37 provinces, which are set out below with their areas and populations.[36]\n\n\n\n\n\nProvinces within the region of Sumatra\n| Name | Area (km2) | Populationcensus2000 | Populationcensus2010 | Populationcensus2015 | Populationcensus2020 | Populationestimate2022 | Capital\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Aceh | 56,834.75 | 4,073,006 | 4,486,570 | 4,993,385 | 5,274,871 | 5,407,900 | Banda Aceh |\n| ![](image) North Sumatra (*Sumatra Utara*) | 72,460.74 | 11,642,488 | 12,326,678 | 13,923,262 | 14,799,361 | 15,115,200 | Medan |\n| ![](image) West Sumatra (*Sumatra Barat*) | 42,119.54 | 4,248,515 | 4,846,909 | 5,190,577 | 5,534,472 | 5,640,600 | Padang |\n| ![](image) Riau | 89,935.90 | 3,907,763 | 5,543,031 | 6,330,941 | 6,394,097 | 6,614,400 | Pekanbaru |\n| ![](image) Riau Islands (*Kepulauan Riau*) | 8,269.71 | 1,040,207 | 1,685,698 | 1,968,313 | 2,064,564 | 2,179,800 | Tanjung Pinang |\n| ![](image) Jambi | 49,026.58 | 2,407,166 | 3,088,618 | 3,397,164 | 3,548,228 | 3,631,100 | Jambi |\n| ![](image) South Sumatra  (*Sumatra Selatan*) | 86,771.68 | 6,210,800 | 7,446,401 | 8,043,042 | 8,467,432 | 8,657,000 | Palembang |\n| ![](image) Bengkulu | 20,128.34 | 1,455,500 | 1,713,393 | 1,872,136 | 2,010,670 | 2,060,100 | Bengkulu |\n| ![](image) Lampung | 33,570.26 | 6,730,751 | 7,596,115 | 8,109,601 | 9,007,848 | 9,176,600 | Bandar Lampung |\n| ![](image) Bangka Belitung Islands  (*Kepulauan Bangka Belitung*) | 16,690.13 | 899,968 | 1,223,048 | 1,370,331 | 1,455,678 | 1,494,600 | Pangkal Pinang |\n| ***Totals*** | 475,807.63 | 42,616,164 | 50,613,947 | 55,198,752 | 58,557,211 | 59,977,300\n |\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of geological formation of Sumatra island\n![](image)Mount Sinabung, North Sumatra\nThe longest axis of the island runs approximately 1,790 km (1,110 mi) northwest–southeast, crossing the equator near the centre. At its widest point, the island spans 435 km (270 mi). The interior of the island is dominated by two geographical regions: the Barisan Mountains in the west and swampy plains in the east. Sumatra is the closest Indonesian island to mainland Asia.\n\n\nTo the southeast is Java, separated by the Sunda Strait. To the north is the Malay Peninsula (located on the Asian mainland), separated by the Strait of Malacca. To the east is Borneo, across the Karimata Strait. West of the island is the Indian Ocean.\n\n\nThe Great Sumatran fault (a strike-slip fault), and the Sunda megathrust (a subduction zone), run the entire length of the island along its west coast. On 26 December 2004, the western coast and islands of Sumatra, particularly Aceh province, were struck by a tsunami following the Indian Ocean earthquake. This was the longest earthquake recorded, lasting between 500 and 600 seconds (8.33–10 minutes).[37] More than 170,000 Indonesians were killed, primarily in Aceh. Other recent earthquakes to strike Sumatra include the 2005 Nias–Simeulue earthquake and the 2010 Mentawai earthquake and tsunami.\n\n\nLake Toba is the site of a supervolcanic eruption that occurred around 74,000 years ago, representing a climate-changing event.[38] The most important rivers in Sumatra belong to the catchment area of the South China Sea. Heading north to south, the Asahan, Rokan, Siak, Kampar, Indragiri, Batanghari flow into the Malacca Strait, while the island's largest river, the Musi, flows into the sea at Bangka Strait in the south. To the east, big rivers carry silt from the mountains, forming the vast lowland interspersed by swamps. Even if mostly unsuitable for farming, the area is currently of great economic importance for Indonesia. It produces oil from both above and below the soil – palm oil and petroleum.\n\n\nSumatra is the largest producer of Indonesian coffee. Small-holders grow Arabica coffee (*Coffea arabica*) in the highlands, while Robusta (*Coffea canephora*) is found in the lowlands. Arabica coffee from the regions of Gayo, Lintong and Sidikilang is typically processed using the Giling Basah (wet hulling) technique, which gives it a heavy body and low acidity.[39]\n\n\nSumatra is a highly seismic island. Huge earthquakes have been recorded throughout history. In 1797, an 8.9 earthquake shook Western Sumatra, and in 1833, a 9.2 earthquake shook Bengkulu and Western Sumatra. Both events caused large tsunamis. Earthquakes are very common throughout the coastal area of the west and center of the island, and tsunamis are common due to the high seismicity in the area.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Largest cities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Medan, the largest city in Sumatra\nBy population, Medan is the largest city in Sumatra.[40] Medan is also the most visited and developed city in Sumatra.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | City\n | Province\n | City Birthday\n | Area (in km2)\n | Population  2010 census\n | Population  2020 census\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | **Medan** | North Sumatra | 1 July 1590\n | 265.10\n | 2,097,610\n | 2,435,252\n |\n| 2\n | **Palembang** | South Sumatra | 17 June 683\n | 400.61\n | 1,455,284\n | 1,668,848\n |\n| 3\n | **Bandar Lampung** | Lampung | 17 June 1682\n | 169.21\n | 881,801\n | 1,166,066\n |\n| 4\n | **Pekanbaru** | Riau | 23 June 1784\n | 633.01\n | 897,767\n | 983,356\n |\n| 5\n | **Padang** | West Sumatra | 7 August 1669\n | 694.96\n | 833,562\n | 909,040\n |\n| 6\n | **Jambi** | Jambi | 17 May 1946\n | 205.00\n | 531,857\n | 606,200\n |\n| 7\n | **Bengkulu** | Bengkulu | 18 March 1719\n | 144.52\n | 308,544\n | 373,591\n |\n| 8\n | **Dumai** | Riau | 20 April 1999\n | 2,039.35\n | 253,803\n | 316,782\n |\n| 9\n | **Binjai** | North Sumatra |  | 90.24\n | 246,154\n | 291,842\n |\n| 10\n | **Pematang Siantar** | North Sumatra | 24 April 1871\n | 60.52\n | 234,698\n | 268,254\n |\n| 11\n | **Banda Aceh** | Aceh | 22 April 1205\n | 61.36\n | 223,446\n | 252,899\n |\n| 12\n | **Lubuklinggau** | South Sumatra | 17 August 2001\n | 419.80\n | 201,308\n | 234,166\n |\n\n\n## Flora and fauna[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of national parks of Indonesia and List of amphibians of Sumatra\n\n![](image)Sumatran tiger\n![](image)*Rafflesia arnoldii*\nSumatra supports a wide range of vegetation types that are home to a rich variety of species, including 17 endemic genera of plants.[41] Unique species include the Sumatran pine which dominates the Sumatran tropical pine forests of the higher mountainsides in the north of the island and rainforest plants such as *Rafflesia arnoldii* (the world's largest individual flower), and the titan arum (the world's largest unbranched inflorescence).\n\n\nThe island is home to 201 mammal species and 580 bird species. There are nine endemic mammal species on mainland Sumatra and 14 more endemic to the nearby Mentawai Islands.[41] There are about 300 freshwater fish species in Sumatra.[42] There are 93 amphibian species in Sumatra, 21 of which are endemic to Sumatra.[43]\n\n\nThe Sumatran tiger, Sumatran rhinoceros, Sumatran elephant, Sumatran ground cuckoo, Sumatran orangutan and Tapanuli orangutan are all critically endangered, indicating the highest level of threat to their survival. In October 2008, the Indonesian government announced a plan to protect Sumatra's remaining forests.[44]\n\n\nThe island includes more than 10 national parks, including three which are listed as the Tropical Rainforest Heritage of Sumatra World Heritage Site – Gunung Leuser National Park, Kerinci Seblat National Park and Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park. The Berbak National Park is one of three national parks in Indonesia listed as a wetland of international importance under the Ramsar Convention.\n\n\nSumatra has lost almost 50% of its tropical rainforest in the last 35 years.[*clarification needed*] Many species are now critically endangered, such as the Sumatran ground cuckoo, the Sumatran tiger, the Sumatran elephant, the Sumatran rhinoceros, and the Sumatran orangutan. Deforestation on the island has also resulted in serious seasonal smoke haze over neighbouring countries, such as the 2013 Southeast Asian haze which caused considerable tensions between Indonesia and affected countries Malaysia and Singapore.[2] The widespread deforestation and other environmental destruction in Sumatra and other parts of Indonesia has often been described by academics as an ecocide.[3][4][5][6]\n\n\n\n## Rail transport[edit]\n\n\nSeveral unconnected railway networks built during Netherlands East Indies exist in Sumatra, such as the ones connecting Banda Aceh-Lhokseumawe-Besitang-Medan-Tebingtinggi-Pematang Siantar-Rantau Prapat in Northern Sumatra (the Banda Aceh-Besitang section was closed in 1971, but is currently being rebuilt).[45] Padang-Solok-Bukittinggi in West Sumatra, and Bandar Lampung-Palembang-Lahat-Lubuk Linggau in Southern Sumatra.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Indonesia portal\n* ![icon](image)Islands portal\n\n\n* Architecture of Sumatra\n* Bukit Seguntang\n* Communism in Sumatra\n* Music of Sumatra\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The *Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia* states that *Sumatra* is the correct spelling in Indonesian;[1] however, it is popularly and legislatively spelled in Indonesian as *Sumatera*.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Hasil Pencarian – KBBI Daring\" [Entry for \"Sumatra\" in the online version of the *Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia*]. *kbbi.kemdikbud.go.id* (in Indonesian).

The island separates the Sea of Japan, which lies to its north and west, from the North Pacific Ocean to the south and east. It is the seventh-largest island in the world, and the second-most populous after the Indonesian island of Java.[8][9][10]\n\n\nHonshu had a population of 104 million as of 2017[update], constituting 81.3% of the entire population of Japan,[11] and mostly concentrated in the coastal areas and plains. Approximately 30% of the total population resides in the Greater Tokyo Area on the Kantō Plain. As the historical center of Japanese cultural and political power,[12] the island includes several past Japanese capitals, including Kyōto, Nara, and Kamakura. Much of the island's southern shore forms part of the Taiheiyō Belt, a megalopolis that spans several of the Japanese islands.[12] Honshu contains Japan's highest mountain, Mount Fuji, and its largest lake, Lake Biwa.[13]\n\n\nMost of Japan's industry is located in a belt running along Honshu's southern coast, from Tokyo to Nagoya, Kyōto, Osaka, Kobe, and Hiroshima;[12] by contrast, the economy along the northwestern Sea of Japan coast is largely based on fishing and agriculture.[14] The island is linked to the other three major Japanese islands by a number of bridges and tunnels. The island primarily shares two climates, with Northern Honshu having a mainly humid continental climate while the south has a humid subtropical climate.[15]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nThe name of the island, Honshū (本州), directly translates to \"main province\" in English.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\nHumans first arrived in Honshu about 60,000 years ago. [16]\n\n\n\n### Meiji Restoration[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | **This section is empty.** You can help by adding to it. *(February 2023)*\n |\n\n\n### World War II[edit]\n\n\nHonshu was the target of devastating air raids during the Pacific War of World War II. The first air raid to strike Honshu and the other home islands was the Doolittle Raid. With the introduction of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress, the firebombing of Tokyo culminated in Operation Meetinghouse, the most destructive air raid in human history, which destroyed 16 square miles (41 km2; 10,000 acres) of central Tokyo, leaving an estimated 100,000 civilians dead, and over one million homeless.[17] The war ended with the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki shortly before Japan's surrender and signing of the Japanese Instrument of Surrender on September 2, 1945, on board the USS *Missouri* (BB-63) in Tokyo Bay.\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Japan as seen from a satellite. Honshu is the largest, middle island.\nThe island is roughly 1,300 km (810 mi) long and ranges from 50 to 230 km (31 to 143 mi) wide, and its total area is 227,960 km2 (88,020 sq mi),[1] making it slightly larger than the island of Great Britain 209,331 km2 (80,823 sq mi).[10] Its land area has been increasing with land reclamation and coastal uplift in the north due to plate tectonics with a convergent boundary. Honshu has 10,084 kilometres (6,266 mi) of coastline.[7]\n\n\nMountainous and volcanic, Honshu experiences frequent earthquakes (the Great Kantō earthquake heavily damaged Tokyo in September 1923, and the earthquake of March 2011 moved the northeastern part of the island by varying amounts of as much as 5.3 m (17 ft)[18][19] while causing devastating tsunamis). The highest peak is the active volcano Mount Fuji at 3,776 m (12,388 ft), which makes Honshu the world's 7th highest island. There are many rivers, including the Shinano River, Japan's longest. The Japanese Alps span the width of Honshu, from the 'Sea of Japan' coast to the Pacific shore. The climate is generally humid subtropical in western Japan and humid continental in the north.\n\n\n\n### Population[edit]\n\n\nHonshu has a total population of 104 million people, according to a 2017 estimate, 81.3% of the entire population of Japan.[11] The largest city is Tokyo (population: 13,988,129),[20] the capital of Japan and part of the Greater Tokyo Area, the most populous metropolitan area in the world.\n\n\n\n### Extreme points[edit]\n\n\n#### Bridges and tunnels[edit]\n\n\nHonshu is connected to the islands of Hokkaidō, Kyūshū and Shikoku by tunnels and bridges. Three bridge systems have been built across the islands of the Inland Sea between Honshu and Shikoku (Akashi Kaikyo Bridge and the Ōnaruto Bridge; Shin-Onomichi Bridge, Innoshima Bridge, Ikuchi Bridge, Tatara Bridge, Ōmishima Bridge, Hakata–Ōshima Bridge, and the Kurushima Kaikyō Bridge; Shimotsui-Seto Bridge, Hitsuishijima Bridge, Iwakurojima Bridge, Yoshima Bridge, Kita Bisan-Seto Bridge, and the Minami Bisan-Seto Bridge), the Seikan Tunnel connects Honshu with Hokkaidō, and the Kanmonkyo Bridge and Kanmon Tunnel connects Honshu with Kyūshū.\n\n\n\n### Flora and fauna[edit]\n\n\nThese are notable flora and fauna of Honshu.\n\n\n\n\n\nNotable flora and fauna[21]\n| Name | Type\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Japanese black bear | Fauna\n | A subspecies of the Asian black bear.

It was the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in Japan, and the fourth most powerful earthquake in the world since modern record-keeping began in 1900.[22][23][24] The tsunami subsequently led to the meltdown of 3 nuclear reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, leading to the Fukushima nuclear disaster.\n\n\n\n### Parks[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mount Fuji seen from Lake Motosu in Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park\n\n\nNational parks (国立公園)\n| Minami Alps National Park | 南アルプス\n |\n| Chūbu-Sangaku National Park | 中部山岳\n |\n| Hakusan National Park | 白山\n |\n| Myōkō-Togakushi Renzan National Park | 妙高戸隠連山\n |\n| Daisen-Oki National Park | 大山隠岐\n |\n| Chichibu Tama Kai National Park | 秩父多摩甲斐\n |\n| Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park | 富士箱根伊豆\n |\n| Jōshin'etsu-kōgen National Park | 上信越高原\n |\n| Nikkō National Park | 日光国立公園\n |\n| Ogasawara National Park | 小笠原\n |\n| Ise-Shima National Park | 伊勢志摩\n |\n| Sanin Kaigan National Park | 山陰海岸\n |\n| Yoshino-Kumano National Park | 吉野熊野\n |\n| Setonaikai National Park | 瀬戸内海\n |\n| Bandai-Asahi National Park | 磐梯朝日\n |\n| Sanriku Fukkō National Park | 三陸復興\n |\n| Towada-Hachimantai National Park | 十和田八幡平\n |\n| Oze National Park | 尾瀬\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Region | List of Quasi-National Parks\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Tōhoku | Shimokita Hantō, Tsugaru, Hayachine, Kurikoma, Minami Sanriku Kinkasan, Zaō, Oga, Chōkai |\n| Kantō | Suigō-Tsukuba, Minami Bōsō, Meiji no Mori Takao, Tanzawa-Ōyama |\n| Chūbu | Echigo Sanzan-Tadami, Myōgi-Arafune-Saku Kōgen, Sado-Yahiko-Yoneyama, Noto Hantō, Echizen-Kaga Kaigan, Yatsugatake-Chūshin Kōgen, Tenryū-Okumikawa, Chūō Alps, Ibi-Sekigahara-Yōrō, Hida-Kisogawa, Aichi Kōgen, Mikawa-wan |\n| Kansai | Suzuka, Wakasa Wan, Tango-Amanohashidate-Ōeyama, Biwako, Murō-Akame-Aoyama, Kongō-Ikoma-Kisen, Yamato-Aogaki, Kōya-Ryūjin, Meiji no Mori Minō, Kyoto Tamba Kogen |\n| Chūgoku | Hyōnosen-Ushiroyama-Nagisan, Hiba-Dōgo-Taishaku, Nishi-Chūgoku Sanchi, Kita-Nagato Kaigan, Akiyoshidai |\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nHonshu island generates around US$3.5 trillion or more than 80% of Japan's GDP.[25]\n\n\n\n### Agriculture[edit]\n\n\nFruit, vegetables, grains, rice and cotton make up the main produce grown in Honshu.[26] The Tohoku region, spanning the north-eastern part of the island, is notable for its rice production, with 65% of cultivated land being rice paddy fields – almost a quarter of all paddy fields in Japan.[27] Chiba Prefecture is famous for its peanuts, also being the largest producer in Japan.[28] Rare species of the lichen genus Menegazzia are found only in Honshu.[29]\n\n\n\n### Industry[edit]\n\n\nMost of Japan's tea and silk is from Honshu.[26] Japan's three largest industrial regions are all located on Honshu: the Keihin region, the Hanshin Industrial Region, and the Chūkyō Industrial Area.\n\n\n\n### Minerals and fuels[edit]\n\n\nHonshu is home to a large portion[30] of Japan's minimal mineral reserves,[31] including small oil and coal deposits. Several coal deposits are located in the northern part of the island,[32] concentrated in Fukushima Prefecture and Niigata Prefecture, though Honshu's coal production is negligible in comparison to Hokkaido and Kyushu.[33] Most of Japan's oil reserves are also located in northern Honshu, along the west coast, spanning Niigata, Yamagata, and Akita Prefectures.[34]\n\n\nMost of Japan's copper, lead, zinc and chromite is located on Honshu, along with smaller, scattered deposits of gold, silver, arsenic, sulfur and pyrite.[35]\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\nThe Tokaido Shinkansen, opened in 1964 between Tokyo and Shin-Ōsaka, is Japan's first high-speed rail line.[36] It is the world's oldest high-speed rail line and one of the most heavily used.[37][38] The San'yō Shinkansen, connects the two largest cities in western Japan, Shin-Osaka in Osaka with Hakata Station in Fukuoka. Both the Tokaido Shinkansen and the Sanyo Shinkansen help form a continuous high-speed railway through the Taiheiyō Belt megalopolis.\n\n\n\n![](image)Mt. Fuji and the Tokaido Shinkansen\n## Administrative regions and prefectures[edit]\n\n\nThe island is divided into five nominal regions and contains 34 prefectures, including metropolitan Tokyo. Administratively, some smaller islands are included within these prefectures, notably including the Ogasawara Islands, Sado Island, Izu Ōshima, and Awaji Island.\n\n\nThe regions and their prefectures are:\n\n\n\n* **Tōhoku region** consists of six prefectures.\n\t+ ![](image) Akita Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Aomori Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Fukushima Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Iwate Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Miyagi Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Yamagata Prefecture\n* **Kantō region** consists of seven prefectures, including the capital of Japan which is the Tokyo Metropolis.\n\t+ ![](image) Chiba Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Gunma Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Ibaraki Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Kanagawa Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Saitama Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Tochigi Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Tokyo\n* **Chūbu region** consists of nine prefectures.\n\t+ ![](image) Aichi Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Fukui Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Gifu Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Ishikawa Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Nagano Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Niigata Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Shizuoka Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Toyama Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Yamanashi Prefecture\n* **Kansai region** consists of seven prefectures.\n\t+ ![](image) Hyōgo Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Kyoto Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Mie Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Nara Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Osaka Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Shiga Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Wakayama Prefecture\n* **Chūgoku region** consists of five prefectures.\n\t+ ![](image) Hiroshima Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Okayama Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Shimane Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Tottori Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Yamaguchi Prefecture\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Japan portal\n* ![icon](image)Islands portal\n\n\n* Geography of Japan\n* Hokkaido\n* Japanese archipelago\n* Kyushu\n* Okinawa\n* Shikoku\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Farjon, Aljos; Filer, Denis (2013). *An Atlas of the World's Conifers: An Analysis of their Distribution, Biogeography, Diversity and Conservation Status*.

The island separates the Sea of Japan, which lies to its north and west, from the North Pacific Ocean to the south and east. It is the seventh-largest island in the world, and the second-most populous after the Indonesian island of Java.[8][9][10]\n\n\nHonshu had a population of 104 million as of 2017[update], constituting 81.3% of the entire population of Japan,[11] and mostly concentrated in the coastal areas and plains. Approximately 30% of the total population resides in the Greater Tokyo Area on the Kantō Plain. As the historical center of Japanese cultural and political power,[12] the island includes several past Japanese capitals, including Kyōto, Nara, and Kamakura. Much of the island's southern shore forms part of the Taiheiyō Belt, a megalopolis that spans several of the Japanese islands.[12] Honshu contains Japan's highest mountain, Mount Fuji, and its largest lake, Lake Biwa.[13]\n\n\nMost of Japan's industry is located in a belt running along Honshu's southern coast, from Tokyo to Nagoya, Kyōto, Osaka, Kobe, and Hiroshima;[12] by contrast, the economy along the northwestern Sea of Japan coast is largely based on fishing and agriculture.[14] The island is linked to the other three major Japanese islands by a number of bridges and tunnels. The island primarily shares two climates, with Northern Honshu having a mainly humid continental climate while the south has a humid subtropical climate.[15]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nThe name of the island, Honshū (本州), directly translates to \"main province\" in English.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\nHumans first arrived in Honshu about 60,000 years ago. [16]\n\n\n\n### Meiji Restoration[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | **This section is empty.** You can help by adding to it. *(February 2023)*\n |\n\n\n### World War II[edit]\n\n\nHonshu was the target of devastating air raids during the Pacific War of World War II. The first air raid to strike Honshu and the other home islands was the Doolittle Raid. With the introduction of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress, the firebombing of Tokyo culminated in Operation Meetinghouse, the most destructive air raid in human history, which destroyed 16 square miles (41 km2; 10,000 acres) of central Tokyo, leaving an estimated 100,000 civilians dead, and over one million homeless.[17] The war ended with the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki shortly before Japan's surrender and signing of the Japanese Instrument of Surrender on September 2, 1945, on board the USS *Missouri* (BB-63) in Tokyo Bay.\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Japan as seen from a satellite. Honshu is the largest, middle island.\nThe island is roughly 1,300 km (810 mi) long and ranges from 50 to 230 km (31 to 143 mi) wide, and its total area is 227,960 km2 (88,020 sq mi),[1] making it slightly larger than the island of Great Britain 209,331 km2 (80,823 sq mi).[10] Its land area has been increasing with land reclamation and coastal uplift in the north due to plate tectonics with a convergent boundary. Honshu has 10,084 kilometres (6,266 mi) of coastline.[7]\n\n\nMountainous and volcanic, Honshu experiences frequent earthquakes (the Great Kantō earthquake heavily damaged Tokyo in September 1923, and the earthquake of March 2011 moved the northeastern part of the island by varying amounts of as much as 5.3 m (17 ft)[18][19] while causing devastating tsunamis). The highest peak is the active volcano Mount Fuji at 3,776 m (12,388 ft), which makes Honshu the world's 7th highest island. There are many rivers, including the Shinano River, Japan's longest. The Japanese Alps span the width of Honshu, from the 'Sea of Japan' coast to the Pacific shore. The climate is generally humid subtropical in western Japan and humid continental in the north.\n\n\n\n### Population[edit]\n\n\nHonshu has a total population of 104 million people, according to a 2017 estimate, 81.3% of the entire population of Japan.[11] The largest city is Tokyo (population: 13,988,129),[20] the capital of Japan and part of the Greater Tokyo Area, the most populous metropolitan area in the world.\n\n\n\n### Extreme points[edit]\n\n\n#### Bridges and tunnels[edit]\n\n\nHonshu is connected to the islands of Hokkaidō, Kyūshū and Shikoku by tunnels and bridges. Three bridge systems have been built across the islands of the Inland Sea between Honshu and Shikoku (Akashi Kaikyo Bridge and the Ōnaruto Bridge; Shin-Onomichi Bridge, Innoshima Bridge, Ikuchi Bridge, Tatara Bridge, Ōmishima Bridge, Hakata–Ōshima Bridge, and the Kurushima Kaikyō Bridge; Shimotsui-Seto Bridge, Hitsuishijima Bridge, Iwakurojima Bridge, Yoshima Bridge, Kita Bisan-Seto Bridge, and the Minami Bisan-Seto Bridge), the Seikan Tunnel connects Honshu with Hokkaidō, and the Kanmonkyo Bridge and Kanmon Tunnel connects Honshu with Kyūshū.\n\n\n\n### Flora and fauna[edit]\n\n\nThese are notable flora and fauna of Honshu.\n\n\n\n\n\nNotable flora and fauna[21]\n| Name | Type\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Japanese black bear | Fauna\n | A subspecies of the Asian black bear.

It was the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in Japan, and the fourth most powerful earthquake in the world since modern record-keeping began in 1900.[22][23][24] The tsunami subsequently led to the meltdown of 3 nuclear reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, leading to the Fukushima nuclear disaster.\n\n\n\n### Parks[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mount Fuji seen from Lake Motosu in Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park\n\n\nNational parks (国立公園)\n| Minami Alps National Park | 南アルプス\n |\n| Chūbu-Sangaku National Park | 中部山岳\n |\n| Hakusan National Park | 白山\n |\n| Myōkō-Togakushi Renzan National Park | 妙高戸隠連山\n |\n| Daisen-Oki National Park | 大山隠岐\n |\n| Chichibu Tama Kai National Park | 秩父多摩甲斐\n |\n| Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park | 富士箱根伊豆\n |\n| Jōshin'etsu-kōgen National Park | 上信越高原\n |\n| Nikkō National Park | 日光国立公園\n |\n| Ogasawara National Park | 小笠原\n |\n| Ise-Shima National Park | 伊勢志摩\n |\n| Sanin Kaigan National Park | 山陰海岸\n |\n| Yoshino-Kumano National Park | 吉野熊野\n |\n| Setonaikai National Park | 瀬戸内海\n |\n| Bandai-Asahi National Park | 磐梯朝日\n |\n| Sanriku Fukkō National Park | 三陸復興\n |\n| Towada-Hachimantai National Park | 十和田八幡平\n |\n| Oze National Park | 尾瀬\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Region | List of Quasi-National Parks\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Tōhoku | Shimokita Hantō, Tsugaru, Hayachine, Kurikoma, Minami Sanriku Kinkasan, Zaō, Oga, Chōkai |\n| Kantō | Suigō-Tsukuba, Minami Bōsō, Meiji no Mori Takao, Tanzawa-Ōyama |\n| Chūbu | Echigo Sanzan-Tadami, Myōgi-Arafune-Saku Kōgen, Sado-Yahiko-Yoneyama, Noto Hantō, Echizen-Kaga Kaigan, Yatsugatake-Chūshin Kōgen, Tenryū-Okumikawa, Chūō Alps, Ibi-Sekigahara-Yōrō, Hida-Kisogawa, Aichi Kōgen, Mikawa-wan |\n| Kansai | Suzuka, Wakasa Wan, Tango-Amanohashidate-Ōeyama, Biwako, Murō-Akame-Aoyama, Kongō-Ikoma-Kisen, Yamato-Aogaki, Kōya-Ryūjin, Meiji no Mori Minō, Kyoto Tamba Kogen |\n| Chūgoku | Hyōnosen-Ushiroyama-Nagisan, Hiba-Dōgo-Taishaku, Nishi-Chūgoku Sanchi, Kita-Nagato Kaigan, Akiyoshidai |\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nHonshu island generates around US$3.5 trillion or more than 80% of Japan's GDP.[25]\n\n\n\n### Agriculture[edit]\n\n\nFruit, vegetables, grains, rice and cotton make up the main produce grown in Honshu.[26] The Tohoku region, spanning the north-eastern part of the island, is notable for its rice production, with 65% of cultivated land being rice paddy fields – almost a quarter of all paddy fields in Japan.[27] Chiba Prefecture is famous for its peanuts, also being the largest producer in Japan.[28] Rare species of the lichen genus Menegazzia are found only in Honshu.[29]\n\n\n\n### Industry[edit]\n\n\nMost of Japan's tea and silk is from Honshu.[26] Japan's three largest industrial regions are all located on Honshu: the Keihin region, the Hanshin Industrial Region, and the Chūkyō Industrial Area.\n\n\n\n### Minerals and fuels[edit]\n\n\nHonshu is home to a large portion[30] of Japan's minimal mineral reserves,[31] including small oil and coal deposits. Several coal deposits are located in the northern part of the island,[32] concentrated in Fukushima Prefecture and Niigata Prefecture, though Honshu's coal production is negligible in comparison to Hokkaido and Kyushu.[33] Most of Japan's oil reserves are also located in northern Honshu, along the west coast, spanning Niigata, Yamagata, and Akita Prefectures.[34]\n\n\nMost of Japan's copper, lead, zinc and chromite is located on Honshu, along with smaller, scattered deposits of gold, silver, arsenic, sulfur and pyrite.[35]\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\nThe Tokaido Shinkansen, opened in 1964 between Tokyo and Shin-Ōsaka, is Japan's first high-speed rail line.[36] It is the world's oldest high-speed rail line and one of the most heavily used.[37][38] The San'yō Shinkansen, connects the two largest cities in western Japan, Shin-Osaka in Osaka with Hakata Station in Fukuoka. Both the Tokaido Shinkansen and the Sanyo Shinkansen help form a continuous high-speed railway through the Taiheiyō Belt megalopolis.\n\n\n\n![](image)Mt. Fuji and the Tokaido Shinkansen\n## Administrative regions and prefectures[edit]\n\n\nThe island is divided into five nominal regions and contains 34 prefectures, including metropolitan Tokyo. Administratively, some smaller islands are included within these prefectures, notably including the Ogasawara Islands, Sado Island, Izu Ōshima, and Awaji Island.\n\n\nThe regions and their prefectures are:\n\n\n\n* **Tōhoku region** consists of six prefectures.\n\t+ ![](image) Akita Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Aomori Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Fukushima Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Iwate Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Miyagi Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Yamagata Prefecture\n* **Kantō region** consists of seven prefectures, including the capital of Japan which is the Tokyo Metropolis.\n\t+ ![](image) Chiba Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Gunma Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Ibaraki Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Kanagawa Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Saitama Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Tochigi Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Tokyo\n* **Chūbu region** consists of nine prefectures.\n\t+ ![](image) Aichi Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Fukui Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Gifu Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Ishikawa Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Nagano Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Niigata Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Shizuoka Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Toyama Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Yamanashi Prefecture\n* **Kansai region** consists of seven prefectures.\n\t+ ![](image) Hyōgo Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Kyoto Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Mie Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Nara Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Osaka Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Shiga Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Wakayama Prefecture\n* **Chūgoku region** consists of five prefectures.\n\t+ ![](image) Hiroshima Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Okayama Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Shimane Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Tottori Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Yamaguchi Prefecture\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Japan portal\n* ![icon](image)Islands portal\n\n\n* Geography of Japan\n* Hokkaido\n* Japanese archipelago\n* Kyushu\n* Okinawa\n* Shikoku\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Farjon, Aljos; Filer, Denis (2013). *An Atlas of the World's Conifers: An Analysis of their Distribution, Biogeography, Diversity and Conservation Status*.

As Greenland is one of the Overseas Countries and Territories of the European Union, citizens of Greenland are also granted European Union citizenship.[14] The capital and largest city of Greenland is Nuuk.[14] Greenland lies between the Arctic and Atlantic oceans, east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. It is the world's largest island,[d] as well as the northernmost area of the world – Kaffeklubben Island off the northern coast is the world's northernmost undisputed point of land, and Cape Morris Jesup on the mainland was thought to be so until the 1960s.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** *Nuna asiilasooq* has equal status as a regional anthem but is generally used only in Greenland.[1]\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Greenlandic has been the sole official language of Greenland since 2009.[2][4]\n3. **^** As of 2000: 410,449 km2 (158,475 sq mi) ice-free; 1,755,637 km2 (677,855 sq mi) ice-covered.  \nDensity: 0.14/km2 (0.36/sq mi) for ice-free areas.\n4. **^** Afro-Eurasia, the Americas, Australia, and Antarctica are all larger than Greenland; but they are generally considered continents, not islands.[15]\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nGreenland is the world's largest non-continental island[82] and the third largest area in North America after Canada and the United States.[83] It is between latitudes 59° and 83°N, and longitudes 11° and 74°W. Greenland is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Greenland Sea to the east, the North Atlantic Ocean to the southeast, the Davis Strait to the southwest, Baffin Bay to the west, the Nares Strait and Lincoln Sea to the northwest.

Named \"Uunartoq Qeqertaq\" (English: *Warming Island*), this island has always been present off the coast of Greenland, but was covered by a glacier. This glacier was discovered in 2002 to be shrinking rapidly, and by 2007 had completely melted away, leaving the exposed island.[94] The island was named Place of the Year by the Oxford Atlas of the World in 2007.[95] Ben Keene, the atlas's editor, commented: \n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"The World Factbook – Central Intelligence Agency\". *cia.gov*.

There is also scheduled boat traffic, but the long distances lead to long travel times and low frequency. There are virtually no roads between cities because the coast has many fjords that would require ferry service to connect a road network. The only exception is a gravel road of 4.8 km (3 mi) length between Kangilinnguit and the now abandoned former cryolite mining town of Ivittuut.[142] In addition, the lack of agriculture, forestry and similar countryside activities has meant that very few country roads have been built. Greenland has no passenger railways.\n\n\nKangerlussuaq Airport (SFJ)[143] is the largest airport and the main aviation hub for international passenger transport. It serves international and domestic airline operated flight.[144] SFJ is far from the vicinity of the larger metropolitan capital areas, 317 km (197 mi) to the capital Nuuk, and airline passenger services are available.[145]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* **Pole of inaccessibility**\n\t+ Pole of Inaccessibility research station\n\t+ Tolstikov\n* Crary\n* A.

Nearly all Greenlanders live along the fjords in the south-west of the main island, which has a relatively mild climate.[155] Whereas the majority of the population lives north of 64°N in colder coastal climates, Greenland's warmest climates such as the vegetated area around Narsarsuaq are sparsely populated.\n\n\nThe majority of the population is Lutheran. The historically important Moravian Brothers (*Herrnhuters*) were a congregation of faith, in a Danish context based in Christiansfeld in South Jutland, and partially of German origin, but their name does not signify they were ethnic Moravians (Czechs).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThere are a total of 13 registered civil airports and 47 helipads in Greenland; most of them are unpaved and located in rural areas. The second-longest runway is at Narsarsuaq Airport, a domestic airport with limited international service in south Greenland. All civil aviation matters are handled by the Danish Transport Authority. Most airports, including Nuuk Airport, have short runways and can only be served by special fairly small aircraft on fairly short flights. Kangerlussuaq Airport, which is around 100 km (62 mi) inland from the west coast, is the major airport of Greenland and the hub for domestic flights. Intercontinental flights connect mainly to Copenhagen. Travel between international destinations (except Iceland) and any city in Greenland requires a plane change.\n\n\nIcelandair operates flights from Reykjavík to a number of airports in Greenland, and the company promotes the service as a day-trip option from Iceland for tourists.[148]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe lowest temperature ever recorded in the Northern Hemisphere was recorded in Greenland, near the topographic summit of the Greenland Ice Sheet, on 22 December 1991, when the temperature reached −69.6 °C (−93.3 °F).[85] In Nuuk, the average daily temperature varies over the seasons from −5.1 to 9.9 °C (22.8 to 49.8 °F).[86] The total area of Greenland is 2,166,086 km2 (836,330 sq mi) (including other offshore minor islands), of which the Greenland ice sheet covers 1,755,637 km2 (677,855 sq mi) (81%) and has a volume of approximately 2,850,000 km3 (680,000 cu mi).[87] The highest point on Greenland is Gunnbjørn Fjeld at 3,700 m (12,100 ft) of the Watkins Range (East Greenland mountain range). The majority of Greenland, however, is less than 1,500 m (4,900 ft) in elevation.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The special territories of the European Union (pre 31 January 2020)\n![](image)Nuuk is Greenland's capital and the seat of the government.\nThe Greenlandic government holds executive power in local government affairs.

Any other member of the cabinet is called a *Naalakkersuisoq* (\"Minister\"). The Greenlandic parliament is called *Inatsisartut* (\"Legislators\").

The sea is rich in fish and invertebrates, especially in the milder West Greenland Current; a large part of the Greenland fauna is associated with marine-based food chains, including large colonies of seabirds. The few native land mammals in Greenland include the polar bear, reindeer (introduced by Europeans), arctic fox, arctic hare, musk ox, collared lemming, ermine, and arctic wolf. The last four are found naturally only in East Greenland, having immigrated from Ellesmere Island. There are dozens of species of seals and whales along the coast.

The radio station Jørgen Brønlund Fjord was, until 1950, the northernmost permanent outpost in the world.\n\n\nThe extreme north of Greenland, Peary Land, is not covered by an ice sheet, because the air there is too dry to produce snow, which is essential in the production and maintenance of an ice sheet.

In southern Greenland, the Illimaussaq alkaline complex consists of pegmatites such as nepheline, syenites (especially kakortokite or naujaite) and sodalite (sodalite-foya). In Ivittuut, where cryolite was formerly mined, there are fluoride-bearing pegmatites. To the north of Igaliku, there are the Gardar alkaline pegmatitic intrusions of augite syenite, gabbro, etc.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n66. **^** \"A Radioactive Cold War Military Base Will Soon Emerge From Greenland's Melting Ice\". *Smithsonian*. 5 August 2016.

Inuit arrived in the 13th century. Though under continuous influence of Norway and Norwegians, Greenland was not formally under the Norwegian crown until 1261. The Norse colonies disappeared in the late 15th century, after Norway was hit by the Black Death and entered a severe decline.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Ocean\n* History\n* Expeditions\n* Research stations\n |\n| Farthest NorthNorth Pole | * Barentsz\n* Heemskerck\n* Hudson\n* Marmaduke\n* Carolus\n* Parry\n* **North magnetic pole**\n\t+ J.

It is expected that much of the labour needed will be imported.[139]\n\n\nThe European Union has urged Greenland to restrict the People's Republic of China development of rare-earth mineral projects, as China accounts for 95% of the world's current supply. However, in early 2013 the government of Greenland said that it had no plans to impose such restrictions.[140]\n\n\nThe public sector, including publicly owned enterprises and the municipalities, plays a dominant role in Greenland's economy. About half the government revenues come from grants from the Danish government, an important supplement to the gross domestic product (GDP). Gross domestic product per capita is equivalent to that of the average economies of Europe.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGreenland is abundant in minerals.[137] Mining of ruby deposits began in 2007. Other mineral prospects are improving as prices are increasing. These include iron, uranium, aluminium, nickel, platinum, tungsten, titanium, and copper. Despite resumption[*when?*] of several hydrocarbon and mineral exploration activities, it will take several years before hydrocarbon production can materialize. The state oil company Nunaoil was created to help develop the hydrocarbon industry in Greenland. The state company Nunamineral has been launched on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange to raise more capital to increase the production of gold, started in 2007.\n\n\nElectricity has traditionally been generated by oil or diesel power plants, even if there is a large surplus of potential hydropower. There is a programme to build hydropower plants.

Located in Melanesia in the southwestern Pacific Ocean, the island is separated from Australia by the 150-kilometre (81-nautical-mile; 93-mile) wide Torres Strait, though both landmasses lie on the same continental shelf. Numerous smaller islands are located to the west and east. The name \"New Guinea\" was given by Spanish explorer Yñigo Ortiz de Retez during his maritime expedition of 1545 due to the resemblance of the indigenous peoples of the island to those in the African region of Guinea.[1]\n\n\nThe eastern half of the island is the major land mass of the independent state of Papua New Guinea. The western half, known as Western New Guinea,[2] forms a part of Indonesia and is organized as the provinces of Papua, Central Papua, Highland Papua, South Papua, Southwest Papua, and West Papua. The largest cities on the island are Jayapura (capital of Papua, Indonesia) and Port Moresby (capital of Papua New Guinea).\n\n\n\n\n## Names[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A 1644 map of New Guinea and the surrounding area\nThe island has been known by various names:\n\n\nThe name *Papua* was used to refer to parts of the island before contact with the West.[3] Its etymology is unclear;[3] one theory states that it derived from Tidore, the language used by the Sultanate of Tidore.[1] An expedition by the Sultan of Tidore, together with Sahmardan, the *Sangaji* of Patani, and the Papuan Gurabesi, managed to conquer some areas in New Guinea, which was then reorganised to form *Korano Ngaruha* (\"Four Kings\") or Raja Ampat, *Papoua Gam Sio* (lit. \"The Papua Nine *Negeri*\"), and *Mafor Soa Raha* (lit. The Mafor \"Four *Soa*\"). The name comes from the words *papo* (\"to unite\") and *ua* (negation), which means \"not united\", i.e. an outlying possession of Tidore.[1][4][5]\n\n\nAnton Ploeg reports that the word *papua* is often said to be derived from the Malay word *papua* or *pua-pua*, meaning \"frizzly-haired\", referring to the very curly hair of the island's inhabitants.[6] However Sollewijn Gelpke in 1993 considered this unlikely as it had been used earlier, and he instead derived it from the Biak phrase *sup i babwa*, which means \"the land below [the sunset]\", and refers to the Raja Ampat Islands. \n\n\nWhen Portuguese and Spanish explorers arrived via the Spice Islands, they also used the name *Papua*.[1][7] However, Westerners, beginning with Spanish explorer Yñigo Ortiz de Retez in 1545, used the name *New Guinea*, due to the resemblance between the indigenous peoples of the island and Africans of the Guinea region.[1] The name is one of several toponyms sharing similar etymologies, ultimately meaning \"land of the blacks\" or similar meanings.\n\n\nThe Dutch, who arrived later under Jacob Le Maire and Willem Schouten, called it *Schouten island*. They later used this name only to refer to islands off the north coast of Papua proper, the Schouten Islands or Biak Island. When the Dutch colonized the main island as part of the Dutch East Indies, they called it *Nieuw Guinea*.[1]\n\n\nThe name *Irian* was used in the Indonesian language to refer to the island and Indonesian province, as *Irian Barat* (West Irian) Province and later *Irian Jaya* Province. The name Irian was suggested during a tribal committee meeting in Tobati, Jayapura, formed by Soegoro Atmoprasodjo under governor JP van Eechoed, to decide on a new name because of the negative association of *Papua*. Frans Kaisiepo, the committee leader, suggested the name from Mansren Koreri myths, *Iri-an* from the Biak language of Biak Island, meaning \"hot land\" (referring to the climate), but also from *Iryan* which means heated process as a metaphor for a land that is entering a new era. In Serui *Iri-an* (lit. \"land-nation\") means \"pillar of nation\", while in Merauke *Iri-an* (lit. \"placed higher-nation\") means \"rising spirit\" or \"to rise\".[5][8] The name was promoted in 1945 by Marcus Kaisiepo, brother of Frans Kaisiepo.[3] The name was politicized later by Corinus Krey,[9] Marthen Indey, Silas Papare, and others with the Indonesian backronym *Ikut Republik Indonesia Anti Nederland* (\"Join the Republic of Indonesia Oppose the Netherlands\").[10][5] *Irian* was used somewhat in 1972.[11] The name was used until 2001, when *Papua* was again used for the island and the province. The name *Irian*, which was originally favored by natives, is now considered to be a name imposed by the authority of Jakarta.[3]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Regions of Oceania: Australasia, Polynesia, Micronesia, and Melanesia. Physiographically, Australasia includes the Australian landmass (including Tasmania), New Zealand, and New Guinea\n![](image)New Guinea located in relation to Melanesia\n![](image)New Guinea map of Köppen climate classificationSee also: List of highest mountains of New Guinea\n\nNew Guinea is an island to the north of the Australian mainland, south of the equator. It is isolated by the Arafura Sea to the west, and the Torres Strait and Coral Sea to the east. Sometimes considered to be the easternmost island of the Indonesian archipelago, it lies north of Australia's Top End, the Gulf of Carpentaria and Cape York Peninsula, and west of the Bismarck Archipelago and the Solomon Islands archipelago.\n\n\nPolitically, the western half of the island comprises six provinces of Indonesia: Papua, Central Papua, Highland Papua, South Papua, West Papua and Southwest Papua. The eastern half forms the mainland of the country of Papua New Guinea.\n\n\n\n![](image)Topographical map of New Guinea The shape of New Guinea is often compared to that of a bird-of-paradise (indigenous to the island), and this results in the usual names for the two extremes of the island: the Bird's Head Peninsula in the northwest (*Vogelkop* in Dutch, *Kepala Burung* in Indonesian; also known as the Doberai Peninsula), and the Bird's Tail Peninsula in the southeast (also known as the Papuan Peninsula).\n\n\nA spine of east–west mountains, the New Guinea Highlands, dominates the geography of New Guinea, stretching over 1,600 km (1,000 mi) across the island, with many mountains over 4,000 m (13,100 ft). The western half of the island contains the highest mountains in Oceania, with its highest point, Puncak Jaya, reaching an elevation of 4,884 m (16,023 ft). The tree line is around 4,000 m (13,100 ft) elevation, and the tallest peaks contain equatorial glaciers—which have been retreating since at least 1936.[12][13][14] Various other smaller mountain ranges occur both north and west of the central ranges. Except in high elevations, most areas possess a warm humid climate throughout the year, with some seasonal variation associated with the northeast monsoon season.\n\n\n\n![](image)Mount Bosavi\nAnother major habitat feature is the vast southern and northern lowlands. Stretching for hundreds of kilometres, these include lowland rainforests, extensive wetlands, savanna grasslands, and some of the largest expanses of mangrove forest in the world. The southern lowlands are the site of Lorentz National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The northern lowlands are drained principally by the Mamberamo River and its tributaries on the western side, and by the Sepik on the eastern side. The more extensive southern lowlands are drained by a larger number of rivers, principally the Digul in the west and the Fly in the east. The largest island offshore, Dolak, lies near the Digul estuary, separated by a strait so narrow it has been named a \"creek\".\n\n\nNew Guinea contains many of the world's ecosystem types: glacial, alpine tundra, savanna, montane and lowland rainforest, mangroves, wetlands, lake and river ecosystems, seagrasses, and some of the richest coral reefs on the planet.\n\n\nThe entire length of the New Guinea Highlands system passes through New Guinea as a vast watershed. The northern rivers flow into the Pacific Ocean, the southern rivers into the Arafura Sea and the Gulf of Papua. On the north side, the largest rivers are the Mamberamo, Sepik and Ramu.\nMamberamo was born from the confluence of two large inland rivers. Tariku comes from the west to the east and Taritatu from the east. These rivers meander through swamps with huge internal descents and then merge. The Mamberamo thus formed reaches the ocean by breaking through the Coastal Mountains. Mamberamo River is navigable to Marine Falls. The Sepik is a much more important river. Similarly, it collects water from a spacious pool. It is 1,100 kilometers from the Victor Emanuel Range to the estuary, making it the longest river in New Guinea. The winding, muddy, sluggish river can be navigated for 500 km. Ramu is a 650 km long river. Its lower section is navigable, but its upper flow is high-falling, fast-flowing. The energy of the river is used by a power plant near the city of Kainantu.\n\n\nOn the south side, the most significant rivers are Pulau, Digul, Fly, Kikori and Purari. The largest river in the western part of the island is Digul. It originates from the Star Mountains, which rise to an altitude of 4,700 m. The coastal plain is bordered by a swamp world hundreds of kilometers wide. Digul is the main transport route to the fertile hills and mountains within the island. The river Fly is born near the eastern branches of the Digul. It is named after one of the ships of the English Royal Fleet, which first sailed into the mouth of the river in 1845. The total length of the river is 1,050 km. Smaller boats can sail 900 km on the river. The estuary section, which decomposes into islands, is 70 km wide. The tide of the sea can have an effect of up to 300 kilometers. Strickland, a tributary of the Fly, reaches the Papuan Plain through wild gorges. Fly and Strickland together form the largest river in New Guinea. The many rivers flowing into the Gulf of Papua form a single delta complex. The rivers of the island are extremely rich in water due to the annual rainfall of 2,000–10,000 mm. According to a modest calculation, the New Guinea River carries about 1,500 km3/a (48,000 m3/s) of water into the sea. Fly alone carries more water 238 km3/a (7,500 m3/s) than all the rivers in Australia combined.[15]\n\n\n\n## Relation to surroundings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Highlands of Papua New Guinea\nThe island of New Guinea lies to the east of the Malay Archipelago, with which it is sometimes included as part of a greater Indo-Australian Archipelago.[16] Geologically it is a part of the same tectonic plate as Australia. When world sea levels were low, the two shared shorelines (which now lie 100 to 140 metres below sea level),[17] and combined with lands now inundated into the tectonic continent of Sahul,[18][19] also known as Greater Australia.[20] The two landmasses became separated when the area now known as the Torres Strait flooded after the end of the last glacial period.\n\n\nAnthropologically, New Guinea is considered part of Melanesia.[21]\n\n\nNew Guinea is differentiated from its drier, flatter,[22] and less fertile[23][24] southern counterpart, Australia, by its much higher rainfall and its active volcanic geology. Yet the two land masses share a similar animal fauna, with marsupials, including wallabies and possums, and the egg-laying monotreme, the echidna. Other than bats and some two dozen indigenous rodent genera,[25] there are no pre-human indigenous placental mammals. Pigs, several additional species of rats, and the ancestor of the New Guinea singing dog were introduced with human colonization.\n\n\nPrior to the 1970s, archaeologists called the single Pleistocene landmass by the name *Australasia*,[18] although this word is most often used for a wider region that includes lands, such as New Zealand, which are not on the same continental shelf. In the early 1970s, they introduced the term *Greater Australia* for the Pleistocene continent.[18] Then, at a 1975 conference and consequent publication,[19] they extended the name *Sahul* from its previous use for just the Sahul Shelf to cover the continent.[18]\n\n\n\n## Political divisions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Political divisions of New Guinea\n![](image)Papua province\n Highland Papua province\n Central Papua province\n South Papua province\n West Papua province, which was divided in December 2022[26]\n\nThe island of New Guinea is divided politically into roughly equal halves across a north–south line:\n\n\n\n* The western portion of the island located west of 141°E longitude (except for a small section of territory to the east of the Fly River which belongs to Papua New Guinea) was formerly a Dutch colony, part of the Dutch East Indies. After the West New Guinea dispute it is now six Indonesian provinces:\n\t+ West Papua with Manokwari as its capital.\n\t+ Papua with the city of Jayapura as its capital.\n\t+ Highland Papua with Jayawijaya Regency as its capital.\n\t+ Central Papua with Nabire Regency as its capital.\n\t+ South Papua with Merauke Regency as its capital.\n\t+ Southwest Papua with Sorong as its capital\n* The eastern part forms the mainland of Papua New Guinea, which has been an independent country since 1975. It was formerly the Territory of Papua and New Guinea governed by Australia, consisting of the Trust Territory of New Guinea (northeastern quarter, formerly German New Guinea), and the Territory of Papua (southeastern quarter). Three of Papua New Guinea's four regions are parts of New Guinea island:\n\t+ Southern, consisting of Western, Gulf, Central, Oro (Northern) and Milne Bay provinces.\n\t+ Highlands, consisting of Southern Highlands, Hela Province, Jiwaka Province, Enga Province, Western Highlands, Simbu and Eastern Highlands provinces.\n\t+ Momase, consisting of Morobe, Madang, East Sepik and Sandaun (West Sepik) provinces.\n\n\n## People[edit]\n\n\nSee also: People of New Guinea\n\n![](image)Yali tribesman in the Baliem Valley\nThe current population of the island of New Guinea is about fifteen million. Archaeological evidence indicates that humans may have inhabited the island continuously since 50,000 BCE,[27][28] and first settlement possibly dating back to 60,000 years ago has been proposed. The island is presently populated by almost a thousand different tribal groups and a near-equivalent number of separate languages, which makes New Guinea the most linguistically diverse area in the world. Ethnologue's 14th edition lists 826 languages of Papua New Guinea and 257 languages of Western New Guinea, total 1073 languages, with 12 languages overlapping.[*clarification needed*] They can be divided into two groups, the Austronesian languages, and all the others placed in the catch-all category of Papuan languages, most of which are unrelated.[29]\n\n\nThe separation is not merely linguistic; warfare among societies was a factor in the evolution of the *men's house*: separate housing for groups of adult men, away from the single-family houses of women and children.[*citation needed*] Pig-based trade between groups and pig-based feasts form a common tradition with the other peoples of southeast Asia and Oceania. Most Papuan societies practice agriculture, supplemented by hunting and gathering.\n\n\n\n![](image)Yali Mabel, Kurulu Village War Chief at Baliem Valley\nCurrent evidence indicates that the Papuans (who constitute the majority of the island's peoples) are descended from the earliest human inhabitants of New Guinea. These original inhabitants first arrived in New Guinea at a time around the Last Glacial Maximum (c. 21,000 years ago) when the island was connected to the Australian continent via a land bridge, forming the landmass of Sahul. These peoples had made the (shortened) sea-crossing from the islands of Wallacea and Sundaland (the present Malay Archipelago) by at least 40,000 years ago.\n\n\n\n![](image)Korowai tribesman\nThe ancestral Austronesian peoples are believed to have arrived considerably later, approximately 3,500 years ago, as part of a gradual seafaring migration from Southeast Asia, possibly originating in Taiwan. Austronesian-speaking peoples colonized many of the offshore islands to the north and east of New Guinea, such as New Ireland and New Britain, with settlements also on the coastal fringes of the main island in places. Human habitation of New Guinea over tens of thousands of years has led to a great deal of diversity, which was further increased by the later arrival of the Austronesians and the more recent history of European and Asian settlement through events like transmigration. \n\n\nLarge areas of New Guinea are yet to be explored by scientists and anthropologists. The Indonesian province of West Papua is home to an estimated 44 uncontacted tribal groups.[30]\n\n\n\n## Biodiversity and ecology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Fauna of New Guinea\n\nWith some 786,000 km2 of tropical land—less than one-half of one percent (0.5%) of the Earth's surface—New Guinea has an immense biodiversity, containing between 5 and 10 percent of the total species on the planet. This percentage is about the same amount as that found in the United States or Australia. A high percentage of New Guinea's species are endemic, and thousands are still unknown to science: probably well over 200,000 species of insect, between 11,000 and 20,000 plant species, and over 650 resident bird species. Most of these species are shared, at least in their origin, with the continent of Australia, which was until fairly recent geological times part of the same landmass (see Australia-New Guinea for an overview). The island is so large that it is considered 'nearly a continent' in terms of its biological distinctiveness.\n\n\nIn the period from 1998 to 2008, conservationists identified 1,060 new species in New Guinea, including 218 plants, 43 reptiles, 12 mammals, 580 invertebrates, 134 amphibians, 2 birds and 71 fish.[31] Between 2011 and 2017, researchers described 465 previously undocumented plant species in New Guinea.[32] As of 2019, the Indonesian portion of New Guinea and the Maluku Islands is estimated to have 9,518 species of vascular plants, of which 4,380 are endemic. In 2020, an international study conducted by a team of 99 experts cataloged 13,634 species representing 1,742 genera and 264 families of vascular plants for New Guinea and its associated islands (Aru Islands, Bismarck Archipelago, D'Entrecasteaux Islands, Louisiade Archipelago), making it the world's most floristically diverse island, surpassing Madagascar (11,488), Borneo (11,165), Java (4,598), and the Philippines (9,432).[33]\n\n\n\n![](image)The raggiana bird-of-paradise is native to New Guinea.\n![](image)The floristic region of Malesia\nBiogeographically, New Guinea is part of Australasia rather than the Indomalayan realm, although New Guinea's flora has many more affinities with Asia than its fauna, which is overwhelmingly Australian. Botanically, New Guinea is considered part of Malesia, a floristic region that extends from the Malay Peninsula across Indonesia to New Guinea and the East Melanesian Islands. The flora of New Guinea is a mixture of many tropical rainforest species with origins in Asia, together with typically Australasian flora. Typical Southern Hemisphere flora include the conifers *Podocarpus* and the rainforest emergents *Araucaria* and *Agathis,* as well as tree ferns and several species of *Eucalyptus*.\n\n\nNew Guinea has 284 species and six orders of mammals: monotremes, three orders of marsupials, rodents and bats; 195 of the mammal species (69%) are endemic. New Guinea has 578 species of breeding birds, of which 324 species are endemic. The island's frogs are one of the most poorly known vertebrate groups, totalling 282 species, but this number is expected to double or even triple when all species have been documented. New Guinea has a rich diversity of coral life and 1,200 species of fish have been found. Also about 600 species of reef-building coral—the latter equal to 75 percent of the world's known total. The entire coral area covers 18 million hectares off a peninsula in northwest New Guinea.\n\n\n\n![](image)New Guinea crocodile\nAs of 2020, the Western portion of New Guinea, Papua and West Papua, accounts for 54% of the island's primary forest and about 51% of the island's total tree cover, according to satellite data.[34]\n\n\n\n### Ecoregions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ecoregions of New Guinea\n\n#### Terrestrial[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the WWF, New Guinea can be divided into twelve terrestrial ecoregions:[35]\n\n\n\n* Central Range montane rain forests\n* Central Range sub-alpine grasslands\n* Huon Peninsula montane rain forests\n* New Guinea mangroves\n* Northern New Guinea lowland rain and freshwater swamp forests\n* Northern New Guinea montane rain forests\n* Southeastern Papuan rain forests\n* Southern New Guinea freshwater swamp forests\n* Southern New Guinea lowland rain forests\n* Trans-Fly savanna and grasslands\n* Vogelkop montane rain forests\n* Vogelkop-Aru lowland rain forests\n\n\n![](image)Coral reefs in Papua New Guinea\n#### Freshwater[edit]\n\n\nThe WWF and Nature Conservancy divide New Guinea into five freshwater ecoregions:[36]\n\n\n\n* Vogelkop–Bomberai\n* New Guinea North Coast\n* New Guinea Central Mountains\n* Southwest New Guinea–Trans-Fly Lowland\n* Papuan Peninsula\n\n\n#### Marine[edit]\n\n\nThe WWF and Nature Conservancy identify several marine ecoregions in the seas bordering New Guinea:[37]\n\n\n\n* Papua\n* Bismarck Sea\n* Solomon Sea\n* Southeast Papua New Guinea\n* Gulf of Papua\n* Arafura Sea\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: History of Papua New Guinea and History of Western New Guinea\n\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The continent of Sahul before the rising ocean sundered Australia and New Guinea after the last ice age\nThe first inhabitants Indigenous people of New Guinea, from whom the Papuan people are probably descended, adapted to the range of ecologies and, in time, developed one of the earliest known agricultures. Remains of this agricultural system, in the form of ancient irrigation systems in the highlands of Papua New Guinea, are being studied by archaeologists. Research indicates that the highlands were an early and independent center of agriculture, with evidence of irrigation going back at least 10,000 years.[38] Sugarcane was cultivated in New Guinea around 6000 BCE.[39]\n\n\nThe gardens of the New Guinea Highlands are ancient, intensive permacultures, adapted to high population densities, very high rainfalls (as high as 10,000 mm per year (400 in/yr)), earthquakes, hilly land, and occasional frost. Complex mulches, crop rotations and tillages are used in rotation on terraces with complex irrigation systems. Western agronomists still do not understand all of the practices, and it has been noted that native gardeners are as, or even more, successful than most scientific farmers in raising certain crops.[40] There is evidence that New Guinea gardeners invented crop rotation well before western Europeans.[41] A unique feature of New Guinea permaculture is the silviculture of *Casuarina oligodon*, a tall, sturdy native ironwood tree, suited to use for timber and fuel, with root nodules that fix nitrogen. Pollen studies show that it was adopted during an ancient period of extreme deforestation.\n\n\nIn more recent millennia, another wave of people arrived on the shores of New Guinea. These were the Austronesian people, who had spread down from Taiwan, through the South-east Asian archipelago, colonising many of the islands on the way. The Austronesian people had technology and skills extremely well adapted to ocean voyaging and Austronesian language speaking people are present along much of the coastal areas and islands of New Guinea. They also introduced pigs and dogs. These Austronesian migrants are considered the ancestors of most people in insular Southeast Asia, from Sumatra and Java to Borneo and Sulawesi, as well as coastal new Guinea.[42]\n\n\n\n### Precolonial history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Group of natives at Mairy Pass. Mainland of British New Guinea in 1885.\n![](image)Papuans on the Lorentz River, photographed during the third South New Guinea expedition in 1912–13\nThe western part of the island was in contact with kingdoms in other parts of modern-day Indonesia. The *Negarakertagama* mentioned the region of Wanin and Sran, in eastern Nusantara as part of Majapahit's tributary. This 'Wanin' has been identified with the Onin Peninsula, part of the Bomberai Peninsula near the city of Fakfak.[43][44], while 'Sran' had been identified as region of Kowiai, just south of Onin peninsula.[5] The sultans of Tidore, in the Maluku Islands, claimed sovereignty over various coastal parts of the island.[45] During Tidore's rule, the main exports of the island during this period were resins, spices, slaves and the highly priced feathers of the bird-of-paradise. In a period of constant conflict called 'hongi wars', in which rival villages or kingdoms would invoke the name of Tidore Sultan, rightly, for punitive expeditions for not fulfilling their tributary obligations, or opportunitively for competitions over resources and prestige.[45] Sultan Nuku, one of the most famous Tidore sultans who rebelled against Dutch colonization, called himself \"Sultan of Tidore and Papua\",[46] during his revolt in 1780s. He commanded loyalty from both Moluccan and Papuan chiefs, especially those of Raja Ampat Islands, from his base in Gebe. Following Tidore's subjugation as Dutch tributary, much of the territory it claimed in western part of New Guinea came under Dutch rule as part of Dutch East Indies.[46]\n\n\n\n### European contact[edit]\n\n\nThe first European contact with New Guinea was by Portuguese and Spanish sailors in the 16th century. In 1526–27, Portuguese explorer Jorge de Meneses saw the western tip of New Guinea and named it *ilhas dos Papuas*. In 1528, the Spanish navigator Álvaro de Saavedra also recorded its sighting when trying to return from Tidore to New Spain. In 1545, Spaniard Íñigo Ortíz de Retes sailed along the north coast of New Guinea as far as the Mamberamo River, near which he landed on 20 June, naming the island 'Nueva Guinea'.[47] The first map showing the whole island (as an island) was published in 1600[*citation needed*] and shows it as 'Nova Guinea'. In 1606, Luís Vaz de Torres explored the southern coast of New Guinea from Milne Bay to the Gulf of Papua including Orangerie Bay, which he named *Bahía de San Lorenzo*. His expedition also discovered Basilaki Island naming it *Tierra de San Buenaventura*, which he claimed for Spain in July 1606.[48] On 18 October, his expedition reached the western part of the island in present-day Indonesia, and also claimed the territory for the King of Spain.\n\n\n\n![](image)New Guinea from 1884 to 1919. The Netherlands controlled the western half of New Guinea, Germany the north-eastern part, and Britain the south-eastern part.\nA successive European claim occurred in 1828, when the Netherlands formally claimed the western half of the island as Netherlands New Guinea. Dutch colonial authority built Fort Du Bus an administrative and trading post established near Lobo, Triton Bay, but by 1835 had been abandoned.[49] Considering that New Guinea had little economic value for them, the Dutch promoted Tidore as suzerain of Papua. By 1849, Tidore's borders had been extended to the proximity of the current international border between Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, as it formed extensive trade pact and custom of *Uli-Siwa* ( federation of nine ).[50]\n\n\nIn 1883, following a short-lived French annexation of New Ireland, the British colony of Queensland annexed south-eastern New Guinea. However, the Queensland government's superiors in the United Kingdom revoked the claim, and (formally) assumed direct responsibility in 1884, when Germany claimed north-eastern New Guinea as the protectorate of German New Guinea (also called Kaiser-Wilhelmsland).\n\n\nThe first Dutch government posts were established in 1898 and in 1902: Manokwari on the north coast, Fak-Fak in the west and Merauke in the south at the border with British New Guinea. The German, Dutch and British colonial administrators each attempted to suppress the still-widespread practices of inter-village warfare and headhunting within their respective territories.[51]\n\n\nIn 1905, the British government transferred some administrative responsibility over southeast New Guinea to Australia (which renamed the area \"Territory of Papua\"); and, in 1906, transferred all remaining responsibility to Australia. During World War I, Australian forces seized German New Guinea, which in 1920 became the Territory of New Guinea, to be administered by Australia under a League of Nations mandate. The territories under Australian administration became collectively known as The Territories of Papua and New Guinea (until February 1942).\n\n\nBefore about 1930, European maps showed the highlands as uninhabited forests.[52] When first flown over by aircraft, numerous settlements with agricultural terraces and stockades were observed. The most startling discovery took place on 4 August 1938, when Richard Archbold discovered the Grand Valley of the Baliem River, which had 50,000 yet-undiscovered Stone Age farmers living in orderly villages. The people, known as the Dani, were the last society of its size to make first contact with the rest of the world.[53] A 1930 expedition led by the prospector Michael Lehay also encountered an indigenous group in the highlands. The inhabitants, believing themselves to be the only people in the world and, having never seen Europeans before, initially believed the explorers to be spirits of the dead due to the local belief that a person's skin turned white when they died and crossed into the land of the dead.[54]\n\n\n\n![](image)A Japanese military map of New Guinea from 1943\n### World War II[edit]\n\n\nMain article: New Guinea campaign\n\n![](image)Australian soldiers resting in the Finisterre Ranges of New Guinea while en route to the front line\nNetherlands New Guinea and the Australian territories (the eastern half ) were invaded in 1942 by the Japanese. The Netherlands were defeated by that stage and did not put up a fight, and the western section was not of any strategic value to either side, they did not battle there. The Japanese invaded the north shore of the Australia territories and were aiming to move south and take the southern shore too. The highlands, northern and eastern parts of the island became key battlefields in the South West Pacific Theatre of World War II. Notable battles were for Port Moresby ( the naval battle is known as the Battle of the Coral Sea), Milne Bay and for the Kakoda track. Papuans often gave vital assistance to the Allies, fighting alongside Australian troops, and carrying equipment and injured men across New Guinea. Approximately 216,000 Japanese, Australian and U.S. soldiers, sailors and airmen died during the New Guinea Campaign.[55]\n\n\n\n### Since World War II[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Papua conflict\n\nFollowing the return to civil administration after World War II, the Australian section was known as the Territory of Papua-New Guinea from 1945 to 1949 and then as Territory of Papua and New Guinea. Although the rest of the Dutch East Indies achieved independence as Indonesia on 27 December 1949, the Netherlands regained control of western New Guinea.\n\n\n\n![](image)Map of New Guinea, with place names as used in English in the 1940s\nDuring the 1950s, the Dutch government began to prepare Netherlands New Guinea for full independence and allowed elections in 1959; the partial elected New Guinea Council took office on 5 April 1961. The Council decided on the name of West Papua (*Papua Barat*) for the territory, along with an emblem, flag, and anthem to complement those of the Netherlands. On 1 October 1962, after some military interventions and negotiations, the Dutch handed over the territory to the United Nations Temporary Executive Authority, until 1 May 1963, when Indonesia took control. The territory was renamed West Irian (*Irian Barat*) and then Irian Jaya. In 1969, Indonesia, under the 1962 New York Agreement, organised a referendum named the Act of Free Choice, in which the military hand picked Papuan tribal elders to vote for integration with Indonesia.[56][57]\n\n\nThere has been significant reported resistance to Indonesian integration and occupation,[58] both through civil disobedience (such as publicly raising the Morning Star flag) and via the formation of the Organisasi Papua Merdeka (OPM, or Free Papua Movement) in 1965.[59] Amnesty International has estimated more than 100,000 Papuans, one-sixth of the population, have died as a result of government-sponsored violence against West Papuans.[60] Reports published by TRT World and De Gruyter Oldenbourg have put the number of killed Papuans since the start of the conflict at roughly 500,000.[61][62]\n\n\n\n![](image)Western New Guinea was formally annexed by Indonesia in 1969.\nFrom 1971, the name Papua New Guinea was used for the Australian territory. On 16 September 1975, Australia granted full independence to Papua New Guinea. In 2000, Irian Jaya was formally renamed \"The Province of Papua\" and a Law on Special Autonomy was passed in 2001. The Law established a Papuan People's Assembly (MRP) with representatives of the different indigenous cultures of Papua. The MRP was empowered to protect the rights of Papuans, raise the status of women in Papua, and to ease religious tensions in Papua; block grants were given for the implementation of the Law as much as $266 million in 2004.[63] The Indonesian courts' enforcement of the Law on Special Autonomy blocked further creation of subdivisions of Papua: although President Megawati Sukarnoputri was able to create a separate West Papua province in 2003 as a fait accompli, plans for a third province on western New Guinea were blocked by the courts.[64] Critics argue that the Indonesian government has been reluctant to establish or issue various government implementing regulations so that the legal provisions of special autonomy could be put into practice, and as a result special autonomy in Papua has \"failed\".[65][66]\n\n\nIn 2022, the Indonesian Government split Papuan Province into four provinces. In addition to Papua Province proper (capital Jayapura), the three new provinces are South Papua (capital Merauke), Central Papua (capital Nabire) and Highland Papua (capital Wamena).[67]\n\n\nThe culture of inter-tribal warfare and animosity between the neighboring tribes are still present in New Guinea.[68]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The alternative name *Nugini* is generally only used as part of the country name of Papua New Guinea, *Papua Nugini*, and of the names of the historical territories of Dutch New Guinea (*Nugini Belanda*), German New Guinea (*Nugini Jerman*), and Territory of New Guinea (*Teritori Nugini*). Thus, *Nugini* is effectively a fossil word.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** Bilveer Singh (2008). *Papua: geopolitics and the quest for nationhood*.

Deeper waters separating Borneo from neighbouring Sulawesi prevented a land connection to that island, creating the divide known as Wallace's Line between Asian and Australia-New Guinea biological regions.[20][21] The island today is surrounded by the South China Sea to the north and northwest, the Sulu Sea to the northeast, the Celebes Sea and the Makassar Strait to the east, and the Java Sea and Karimata Strait to the south. To the west of Borneo are the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. To the south and east are islands of Indonesia: Java and Sulawesi, respectively.

Palm oil plantations have been widely developed and are rapidly encroaching on the last remnants of primary rainforest.[48] Forest fires since 1997, started by the locals to clear the forests for plantations were exacerbated by an exceptionally dry El Niño season, worsening the annual shrinkage of the rainforest.[49] During these fires, hotspots were visible on satellite images and the resulting haze frequently affected Brunei, Indonesia and Malaysia. The haze could also reach southern Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and the Philippines as evidenced on the 2015 Southeast Asian haze.[50]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to ancient Chinese (977),[54]: 129 Indian and Japanese manuscripts, western coastal cities of Borneo had become trading ports by the first millennium AD.[55] In Chinese manuscripts, gold, camphor, tortoise shells, hornbill ivory, rhinoceros horn, crane crest, beeswax, lakawood (a scented heartwood and root wood of a thick liana, *Dalbergia parviflora*), dragon's blood, rattan, edible bird's nests and various spices were described as among the most valuable items from Borneo.[56] The Indians named Borneo *Suvarnabhumi* (the land of gold) and also *Karpuradvipa* (Camphor Island). The Javanese named Borneo *Puradvipa*, or Diamond Island. Archaeological findings in the Sarawak river delta reveal that the area was a thriving centre of trade between India and China from the 6th century until about 1300.[56]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Lake Sentarum, Kapuas Hulu Regency, West Kalimantan\nThe largest river system is the Kapuas in West Kalimantan, with a length of 1,143 km (710 mi).[23] Other major rivers include the Mahakam in East Kalimantan (980 km (610 mi) long),[24] the Barito, Kahayan, and Mendawai in South Kalimantan (1,090 km (680 mi), 658 km (409 mi), and 616 km (383 mi) long respectively),[25] Rajang in Sarawak (565 km (351 mi) long)[26] and Kinabatangan in Sabah (560 km (350 mi) long).[27] Borneo has significant cave systems. In Sarawak, the Clearwater Cave has one of the world's longest underground rivers while Deer Cave is home to over three million bats, with guano accumulated to over 100 metres (330 ft) deep.[28] The Gomantong Caves in Sabah has been dubbed as the \"Cockroach Cave\" due to the presence of millions of cockroaches inside the cave.[29][30] The Gunung Mulu National Park in Sarawak and Sangkulirang-Mangkalihat Karst in East Kalimantan which particularly a karst areas contains thousands of smaller caves.[31]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n49. **^** Jonathan Kaiman (21 October 2015). \"Fires in Southeast Asia may be emitting more greenhouse gases than the entire U.S.\" *Los Angeles Times*.

The southern part saw guerrilla conflicts followed by Dutch blockade to cut supplies for nationalist within the region.[121] While nationalist guerrillas supporting the inclusion of southern Borneo in the new Indonesian republic were active in Ketapang, and to lesser extent in Sambas where they rallied with the red-white flag which became the flag of Indonesia, most of the Chinese residents in southern Borneo expected to be liberated by Chinese Nationalist troops from mainland China and to integrate their districts as an overseas province of China.[122] Meanwhile, Sarawak and Sabah in northern Borneo became separate British crown colonies in 1946.[123][124]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince the fall of Singapore, the Japanese sent several thousand of British and Australian prisoners of war to camps in Borneo such as Batu Lintang camp. From the Sandakan camp site, only six of some 2,500 prisoners survived after they were forced to march in an event known as the Sandakan Death March.[114] In addition, of the total of 17,488 Javanese labourers brought in by the Japanese during the occupation, only 1,500 survived mainly due to starvation, harsh working conditions and maltreatment.[107] The Dayak and other indigenous people played a role in guerrilla warfare against the occupying forces, particularly in the Kapit Division. They temporarily revived headhunting of Japanese toward the end of the war,[115] with Allied Z Special Unit provided assistance to them.[116] Australia contributed significantly to the liberation of Borneo.[117] The Australian Imperial Force was sent to Borneo to fight off the Japanese.[118] Together with other Allies, the island was completely liberated in 1945.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Sultanate of Brunei declared independence from Majapahit following the death of the Majapahit emperor in the mid-14th century.

In the first stage of the war, the British saw the Japanese advance to Borneo as motivated by political and territorial ambitions rather than economic factors.[106] The occupation drove many people in the coastal towns to the interior, searching for food and escaping the Japanese.[107] The Chinese residents in Borneo, especially with the Sino-Japanese War in Mainland China mostly resisted the Japanese occupation.[108] Following the formation of resistance movements in northern Borneo such as the Jesselton Revolt, many innocent indigenous and Chinese people were executed by the Japanese for their alleged involvement.[109]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1895, Marcus Samuel received a concession in the Kutei area of east Borneo, and based on oil seepages in the Mahakam River delta, Mark Abrahams struck oil in February 1897.

It is an important refuge for many endemic forest species, including the Borneo elephant, the eastern Sumatran rhinoceros, the Bornean clouded leopard, the Bornean rock frog, the hose's palm civet and the dayak fruit bat.[34][35]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Native people of Borneo referred to their island as *Pulu K'lemantang* but not as an ethnic name, when the sixteenth century Portuguese explorer Jorge de Menezes made contact with the native which became the name for modern-day Indonesian Borneo.[5][6][7] The term kelamantan is used in Sarawak to refer to a group of people who consume sago in the northern part of the island.[8] According to Crowfurd, the word kelamantan is the name of a type of mango (Mangifera) so the island of Borneo is called a mango island by the native. But he adds that the word is fanciful and unpopular.[9] The local mango, called klemantan, is still widely found in rural areas in Ketapang and surrounding areas of West Kalimantan.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSarawak and Brunei in northern Borneo had become British protectorate.[101] The area in southern Borneo was made Dutch protectorate in 1891.[77] The Dutch who already claimed the whole Borneo were asked by Britain to delimit their boundaries between the two colonial territories to avoid further conflicts.[101] The British and Dutch governments had signed the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 to exchange trading ports in Malay Peninsula and Sumatra that were under their controls and assert spheres of influence. This resulted in indirectly establishing British- and Dutch-controlled areas in the north (Malay Peninsula) and south (Sumatra and Riau Islands) respectively.[102]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nInternationally it is known as *Borneo*, derived from European contact with the Brunei kingdom in the 16th century during the Age of Exploration. On a map from around 1601, Brunei city is referred to as Borneo, and the whole island is also labelled Borneo.[11][12] The name *Borneo* may derive from the Sanskrit word **váruṇa** (वरुण), meaning either \"water\" or Varuna, the Hindu god of rain.[13]\n\n\nAnother source said it was from the Sanskrit word *Kalamanthana*, meaning \"burning weather\" possibly to describe its hot and humid tropical weather.[14] In Indianized malay era the name *Kalamanthana* was derived from Sanskrit terms *kala* (time or season) and *manthana* (churning, kindling or creating fire by friction),[15] which possibly describes the heat of the weather.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* Eko Prayitno Joko. \"Isu Pemilikan Wilayah Pantai Timur Sabah: Satu Penulusuran daripada Sumber Sejarah\" (PDF) (in Malay and English).

King Andrianjaka founded Antananarivo as the capital of his Imerina Kingdom around 1610 or 1625 upon the site of a captured Vazimba capital on the hilltop of Analamanga.[44] As Merina dominance expanded over neighboring Malagasy peoples in the early 19th century to establish the Kingdom of Madagascar, Antananarivo became the center of administration for virtually the entire island. In 1896 the French colonizers of Madagascar adopted the Merina capital as their center of colonial administration. The city remained the capital of Madagascar after regaining independence in 1960. In 2017, the capital's population was estimated at 1,391,433 inhabitants.[150] The next largest cities are Antsirabe (500,000), Toamasina (450,000) and Mahajanga (400,000).[47]\n\n\n\n### Politics[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest cities or towns in MadagascarAccording to the 2018 Census[209]\n |\n| --- |\n| Rank\n | Name | Region | Municipal pop.\n |\n| 1 | Antananarivo | Analamanga | 1,275,207\n |\n| 2 | Toamasina | Atsinanana | 326,286\n |\n| 3 | Antsirabe | Vakinankaratra | 245,592\n |\n| 4 | Mahajanga | Boeny | 244,722\n |\n| 5 | Fianarantsoa | Haute Matsiatra | 189,879\n |\n| 6 | Toliara | Atsimo-Andrefana | 169,760\n |\n| 7 | Antsiranana | Diana | 131,165\n |\n| 8 | Hell-Ville | Diana | 109,365\n |\n| 9 | Sambava | Sava | 85,659\n |\n| 10 | Taolagnaro | Anosy | 67,188\n |\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Malagasy child\nMain articles: Malagasy language and Languages of Madagascar\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMadagascar consists of the island of Madagascar and numerous smaller peripheral islands.

PMID 28608869.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOne hypothesis relates *Madagascar* to the word *Malay*, referring to the Austronesian origin of the Malagasy people in modern-day Indonesia. In a map by Muhammad al-Idrisi dating from the year 1154, the island is named *Gesira Malai*, or \"Malay island\" in Arabic. The inversion of this name to *Malai Gesira*, as it was known by the Greeks, is thought to be the precursor of the modern name of the island.[27] The name \"Malay island\" was later rendered in Latin as *Malichu*, an abbreviated form of *Malai Insula*, in the medieval Hereford Mappa Mundi as the name of Madagascar.[28][27]\n\n\nAnother hypothesis is that *Madagascar* is a corrupted transliteration of Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia and an important medieval Indian Ocean port. This would have resulted from 13th-century Venetian explorer Marco Polo confusing the two locations in his memoirs, in which he mentions the land of *Madageiscar* to the south of Socotra. This name would then have been popularized on Renaissance maps by Europeans.[25][26]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMadagascar is the world's principal supplier of vanilla, cloves[187] and ylang-ylang.[98] The island supplies 80% of the world's natural vanilla.[188] Other key agricultural resources include coffee, lychees and shrimp. Key mineral resources include various types of precious and semi-precious stones, and it currently provides half of the world's supply of sapphires, which were discovered near Ilakaka in the late 1990s.[189]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThese central highlands, traditionally the homeland of the Merina people and the location of their historic capital at Antananarivo, are the most densely populated part of the island and are characterized by terraced, rice-growing valleys lying between grassy hills and patches of the subhumid forests that formerly covered the highland region. To the west of the highlands, the increasingly arid terrain gradually slopes down to the Mozambique Channel and mangrove swamps along the coast.[96]\n\n\nMadagascar's highest peaks rise from three prominent highland massifs: Maromokotro 2,876 m (9,436 ft) in the Tsaratanana Massif is the island's highest point, followed by Boby Peak 2,658 m (8,720 ft) in the Andringitra Massif, and Tsiafajavona 2,643 m (8,671 ft) in the Ankaratra Massif. To the east, the *Canal des Pangalanes* is a chain of human-made and natural lakes connected by canals built by the French just inland from the east coast and running parallel to it for some 600 km (370 mi).[97]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana resulted in the separation of East Gondwana (comprising Madagascar, Antarctica, Australia and the Indian subcontinent) and West Gondwana (Africa–South America) during the Jurassic period, around 185 million years ago. The Indo-Madagascar landmass separated from Antarctica and Australia around 125 million years ago[94] and Madagascar separated from the Indian landmass about 84–92 million years ago during the Late Cretaceous.[95] This long history of separation from other continents has allowed plants and animals on the island to evolve in relative isolation. Along the length of the eastern coast runs a narrow and steep escarpment containing much of the island's remaining tropical lowland forest. To the west of this ridge lies a plateau in the center of the island ranging in altitude from 750 to 1,500 m (2,460 to 4,920 ft) above sea level. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIsland country in the Indian Ocean\n\nThis article is about the island nation.

Antananarivo is connected to Toamasina, Ambatondrazaka and Antsirabe by rail, and another rail line connects Fianarantsoa to Manakara. The most important seaport in Madagascar is located on the east coast at Toamasina. Ports at Mahajanga and Antsiranana are significantly less used because of their remoteness.[46] Madagascar's government hopes to expand the ports of Antsiranana in the north and Taolagnaro in the south, connecting them to improved road networks, since many imports are every day necessities and Madagascar also relies on export money.**[196]**[198][199] The island's newest port at Ehoala, constructed in 2008 and privately managed by Rio Tinto, will come under state control upon completion of the company's mining project near Tôlanaro around 2038.[190] Air Madagascar services the island's many small regional airports, which offer the only practical means of access to many of the more remote regions during rainy season road washouts.[46]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2003, Ravalomanana announced the Durban Vision, an initiative to more than triple the island's protected natural areas to over 60,000 km2 (23,000 sq mi) or 10 percent of Madagascar's land surface. As of 2011[update], areas protected by the state included five Strict Nature Reserves (*Réserves Naturelles Intégrales*), 21 Wildlife Reserves (*Réserves Spéciales*) and 21 National Parks (*Parcs Nationaux*).[141] In 2007 six of the national parks were declared a joint World Heritage Site under the name Rainforests of the Atsinanana. These parks are Marojejy, Masoala, Ranomafana, Zahamena, Andohahela and Andringitra.[142] Local timber merchants are harvesting scarce species of rosewood trees from protected rainforests within Marojejy National Park and exporting the wood to China for the production of luxury furniture and musical instruments.[143]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n128. **^** Glaw, F.; Köhler, J.

According to the constitution, executive power is exercised by the government while legislative power is vested in the ministerial cabinet,[146] the Senate and the National Assembly, although in reality these two latter bodies have very little power or legislative role.

The first settlers encountered Madagascar's abundance of megafauna,[38] including 17 species of giant lemurs, the large flightless elephant birds (including possibly the largest bird to ever exist, *Aepyornis maximus*), the giant fossa, and several species of Malagasy hippopotamus, which have since become extinct because of hunting and habitat destruction.[39] By 600 CE, groups of these early settlers had begun clearing the forests of the central highlands.[40]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nChinese, Indian and Comoran minorities are present in Madagascar, as well as a small European (primarily French) populace. Emigration in the late 20th century has reduced these minority populations, occasionally in abrupt waves, such as the exodus of Comorans in 1976, following anti-Comoran riots in Mahajanga.[46] By comparison, there has been no significant emigration of Malagasy peoples.[97] The number of Europeans has declined since independence, reduced from 68,430 in 1958[81] to 17,000 three decades later. There were an estimated 25,000 Comorans, 18,000 Indians, and 9,000 Chinese living in Madagascar in the mid-1980s.[46]\n\n\n\n### Largest cities[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Country Profile from BBC News\n* Madagascar. *The World Factbook*.

In either case, these dates make Madagascar one of the latest major landmasses on Earth to be settled by humans, predating the settlement of Iceland and New Zealand.[33] It is proposed that Ma'anyan people were brought as laborers and slaves by Javanese and Sumatran-Malays in their trading fleets to Madagascar.[34][35][36][37] Dates earlier than the mid-first millennium AD are not strongly supported.[15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA number of other mammals, including the catlike fossa, are endemic to Madagascar. Over 300 species of birds have been recorded on the island, of which over 60 percent (including four families and 42 genera) are endemic.[101] The few families and genera of reptiles that have reached Madagascar have diversified into more than 260 species, with over 90 percent of these being endemic[127] (including one endemic family).[101] The island is home to two-thirds of the world's chameleon species,[127] including the smallest known.[128]\n\n\nEndemic fish of Madagascar include two families, 15 genera and over 100 species, primarily inhabiting the island's freshwater lakes and rivers. Although invertebrates remain poorly studied in Madagascar, researchers have found high rates of endemism among the known species.

Of these, 23 species were classified as critically endangered. A 2023 study published in *Nature Communications* found that 120 of the 219 mammal species only found on Madagascar are threatened with extinction.[140]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain articles: Wildlife of Madagascar, Flora of Madagascar, Fauna of Madagascar, Agriculture in Madagascar, Ecoregions of Madagascar, and List of World Heritage Sites in Madagascar\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n33. **^** Crowley, B.E.

Malagasy and French are both official languages of the state. Christianity is the country's predominant religion, with a significant minority still practicing traditional faiths. Madagascar is classified as a least developed country by the UN.[20] Ecotourism and agriculture, paired with greater investments in education, health and private enterprise, are key elements of its development strategy. Despite substantial economic growth since the early 2000s, income disparities have widened, and quality of life remains low for the majority of the population.

No single Malagasy-language name predating *Madagasikara* appears to have been used by the local population to refer to the island, although some communities had their own name for part or all of the land they inhabited.[26]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe name *Malagasikara*, or **Malagascar**, is also historically attested.

Mount Thor, with an elevation of 1,675 m (5,495 ft), is said to have the greatest purely vertical drop (a sheer cliff face) of any mountain on Earth, at 1,250 m (4,100 ft).[24] Mount Sharat,[25] with an elevation of 422 m (1,385 ft) and a prominence of 67 m (220 ft) is located on Baffin Island. The mountain is named after geologist Sharat Kumar Roy, the chief geology curator in the Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago. Roy, a native of India, studied in India, London, and earned his Ph.D. at the University of Chicago.

This name is used for the administrative region the island is part of (Qikiqtaaluk Region), as well as in multiple places in Nunavut and the Northwest Territories,[7] such as some smaller islands: Qikiqtaaluk in Baffin Bay and Qikiqtaaluk in Foxe Basin. Norse explorers referred to it as *Helluland* (\"stone land\").[8] In 1576, English seaman Martin Frobisher made landfall on the island, naming it \"Queen Elizabeth's Foreland\" and Frobisher Bay is named after him.[9] The island is named after English explorer William Baffin, who, in 1616,[10] came across the island while trying to discover the Northwest Passage.[11] It was also formerly known as **James Island**.[12]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. **^** \"The Atlas of Canada - Search\". *archive.is*.

Bjarni appears to be the first European to see Baffin Island, and the first European to see North America beyond Greenland.[31] It was about 15 years later that the Norse Greenlanders, led by Leif Erikson, a son of Erik the Red, started exploring new areas around the year 1000.[31] Baffin Island is thought to be Helluland, and the archaeological site at Tanfield Valley is thought to have been a trading post.[33][34] The Saga of Erik the Red, 1880 translation into English by J. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe largest summer visitor to Baffin Island is the bowhead whale. Found throughout the Arctic range, one group of bowhead whales is known to migrate to the Foxe Basin, a bay on the western side of Baffin Island.\n\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Mary River Mine, an iron ore mine with an estimated 21-year life, at Mary River, may include building a railway and a port to transport the ore.[60] This may create a temporary mining community there.\n\n\n\n## Wildlife[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Baffin Island red fox\nBaffin Island is home to the Dewey Soper Migratory Bird Sanctuary and the Bowman Bay Wildlife Sanctuary.\n\n\nThe Dewey Soper Migratory Bird Sanctuary, named for J.

Baffin Island is one of the major nesting destinations from the Eastern and Mid-West flyways for many species of migrating birds. Waterfowl include eiders, Canada goose, snow goose, cackling goose, and brant goose (brent goose). Shore birds include the phalarope, various waders (commonly called sandpipers), murres including Brünnich's guillemot, and plovers. Gull species also nest on Baffin Island and they include Sabine's gull,[74] glaucous gull, herring gull and ivory gull.[75][76]\n\n\nLong-range travellers include the Arctic tern, which migrates from Antarctica every spring. The varieties of water birds that nest here include coots, loons, mallards, and many other duck species.[76]\n\n\n\n### Marine mammals[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Air view - Kimmirut to Pangnirtung\nBaffin Island lies in the path of a generally northerly airflow all year round, so, like much of northeastern Canada, it has an extremely cold climate. This brings very long, cold winters and foggy, cloudy summers, which have helped to add to the remoteness of the island. Spring thaw arrives much later than normal for a position straddling the Arctic Circle: around early June at Iqaluit in the south-east but around early- to mid-July on the north coast where glaciers run right down to sea level. Snow, even heavy snow, can occur at any time of the year, although it is least likely in July and early August. Average annual temperatures at Iqaluit are around −9.5 °C (14.9 °F), compared with around 5 °C (41 °F) in Reykjavík,[maps 1] which is at a similar latitude.[81]\n\n\nSea ice surrounds the island for most of the year and only disappears completely from the north coast for short, unpredictable periods from mid- to late June until the end of September.[82]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBeluga or white whales migrate along the coast of Baffin Island; some head north to the feeding grounds in the Davis Strait between Greenland and Baffin Island, or into the Hudson Strait or any of the bays and estuaries in between. Usually travelling in pods of two or more, they can often be found very close to shore (100 m [330 ft] or less). They come up to breathe every 30 seconds or so as they make their way along the coastline eating crustaceans.\n\n\nNarwhals, which are known for the males' long, spiralling single tusk, can also be found along the coast of Baffin Island in the summer. Much like their beluga cousins, they may be found in pairs or even in a large pod of ten or more males, females and newborns. They also can be often found close to the shoreline, gracefully pointing their tusks skyward as they come up for air.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Boas, Franz, and Ludger Müller-Wille. *Franz Boas Among the Inuit of Baffin Island, 1883–1884 Journals and Letters*.

They migrate in large pods consisting of a hundred or more seals to within 1–8 km (0.62–4.97 mi) of the shoreline, which they then follow, feeding on crustaceans and fish.[79]\n\n\nWalruses, which do not migrate far off land in the winter. They merely follow the fast ice, or ice that is solidly attached to land, and stay ahead of it as the ice hardens further and further out to sea. As winter progresses, they will always remain where there is open water free of ice. When the ice melts, they move in to land and can be found basking on rocks close to shore.

Unlike the grey wolf in southern climes, Arctic wolves often have smaller social networks, due to the barren landscape and minimal resources, thus resulting in unique hierarchies when compared with wolves found further south. For example, Arctic wolves often do not hunt in packs, although a male-female pair may hunt together. \n\n\n\n![](image)Satellite image of Baffin Island\n![](image)An ice-covered fjord on Baffin Island, with Davis Strait in the background\n### Birds[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPolar bears can be found all along the coast of Baffin Island but are most prevalent where the sea ice takes the form of pack ice, where their major food sources—ringed seals (jar seal) and bearded seals—live. Polar bears mate approximately every year, bearing one to three cubs around March. Female polar bears may travel 10–20 km (6.2–12.4 mi) inland to find a large snow bank where they dig a den in which to spend the winter and later give birth. The polar bear population here is one of 19 genetically distinct demes of the circumpolar region.[72]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRed foxes can be found predominantly in the southernmost areas of Baffin Island, away from the harshest of winter weather, though some individuals may forage and explore elsewhere. The Arctic foxes can usually be found where polar bears venture on the fast ice close to land in their search for seals. Arctic foxes are scavengers and often follow polar bears to get their leavings. They also are known to take ground-nesting birds and their eggs and chicks, such as ducks, geese, ptarmigan, seagulls, shorebirds and even snowy owls, on occasion. On Baffin Island, Arctic foxes are sometimes trapped by Inuit, but there is no longer a robust fur industry.[73]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n70. **^** Mech, David (September 1, 2005). \"Decline and Recovery of a High Arctic Wolf-Prey System\". *Arctic*. **58** (3). doi:10.14430/arctic432.

It lives offshore within 8 km (5.0 mi) of land. In winter, it makes a number of breathing holes in the ice, up to 2 m (6 ft 7 in) thick. It visits each one often to keep the hole open and free from ice. In March, when a female is ready to whelp, she will enlarge one of the breathing holes that has snow over it, creating a small \"igloo\" where she whelps one or two pups. Within three weeks the pups are in the water and swimming. In summer, some ringed seals keep to a narrow territory about 3 km (1.9 mi) along the shoreline but may move out into the open water. In the spring they spend more time on the surface of the ice.[77]\n\n\n\n#### Summer visitors[edit]\n\n\nWater species that visit Baffin Island in the summer are:\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWilliam W. Fitzhugh, Director of the Arctic Studies Center at the Smithsonian Institution, and a Senior Scientist at the National Museum of Natural History, wrote that there is insufficient published evidence to support Sutherland's claims, and that the Dorset were using spun cordage by the 6th century.[40] In 1992, Elizabeth Wayland Barber wrote that a piece of three-ply yarn that dates to the Paleolithic era, that ended about 10,000 BP, was found at the Lascaux caves in France. This yarn consisted of three s-twist strands that were z-plied, much like the way a three-ply yarn is made now, the Baffin Island yarn was a simple two-ply yarn.[36] The eight sod buildings and artifacts found in the 1960s at L'Anse aux Meadows, located on the northern tip of Newfoundland Island, remains the only confirmed Norse site in North America outside of those found in Greenland.[41]\n\n\n\n## Administration[edit]\n\n\nBaffin Island is part of the Qikiqtaaluk Region.\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMost of Baffin Island lies north of the Arctic Circle—all communities from Pangnirtung northwards have polar night in winter and midnight sun in summer. The eastern community of Clyde River has twilight instead of night from April 26 until May 13, continuous sunlight for 21⁄2 months from May 14 to July 28, then twilight instead of night from July 29 until August 16. This gives the community just over 31⁄2 months without true night. In the winter, the sun sets on November 22 and does not rise again until January 19 of the next year. Pond Inlet has civil twilight from December 16 to December 26. However, there is twilight for at least 4 hours per day, unlike places such as Eureka.[83]\n\n\nLike most of Nunavut and the Canadian Arctic, Baffin Island has a tundra climate (Köppen climate classification *ET*), although the highest ice caps have an ice cap climate (*EF*). The sea is frozen for most of the year, and only a few months are above freezing. There can be seasonal lag in spring.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nArctic hares are found throughout Baffin Island. Their fur is pure white in winter and moults to a scruffy dark grey in summer. Arctic hares and lemmings are an important food source for Arctic and red foxes and Arctic wolves.[68][69][70]\n\n\nLemmings are also found throughout the island and are a major food source for foxes, wolves and the snowy owl. In the winter, lemmings dig complicated tunnel systems through the snow drifts to get to their food supply of dry grasses and lichens.[71]\n\n\n\n### Predators[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSephton from the original Icelandic 'Eiríks saga rauða':\n\n\n\n\n> They sailed away from land; then to the Vestribygd and to Bjarneyjar (the Bear Islands). Thence they sailed away from Bjarneyjar with northerly winds. They were out at sea two half-days. Then they came to land, and rowed along it in boats, and explored it, and found there flat stones, many and so great that two men might well lie on them stretched on their backs with heel to heel. Polar-foxes were there in abundance. This land they gave name to, and called it Helluland (stone-land).[33]\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n30. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Weber, Bob (July 22, 2018). \"Ancient Arctic people may have known how to spin yarn long before Vikings arrived\". *Old theories being questioned in light of carbon-dated yarn samples*.

It is the largest island that is fully within Indonesian territory, as well as the sixth-largest island in the world at 475,807.63 km2 (182,812 mi.2), including adjacent islands such as the Simeulue, Nias, Mentawai, Enggano, Riau Islands, Bangka Belitung and Krakatoa archipelago.\n\n\nSumatra is an elongated landmass spanning a diagonal northwest–southeast axis. The Indian Ocean borders the northwest, west, and southwest coasts of Sumatra, with the island chain of Simeulue, Nias, Mentawai, and Enggano off the western coast. In the northeast, the narrow Strait of Malacca separates the island from the Malay Peninsula, which is an extension of the Eurasian continent. In the southeast, the narrow Sunda Strait, containing the Krakatoa Archipelago, separates Sumatra from Java. The northern tip of Sumatra is near the Andaman Islands, while off the southeastern coast lie the islands of Bangka and Belitung, Karimata Strait and the Java Sea. The Bukit Barisan mountains, which contain several active volcanoes, form the backbone of the island, while the northeastern area contains large plains and lowlands with swamps, mangrove forest and complex river systems. The equator crosses the island at its centre in West Sumatra and Riau provinces. The climate of the island is tropical, hot, and humid. Lush tropical rain forest once dominated the landscape.\n\n\nSumatra has a wide range of plant and animal species but has lost almost 50% of its tropical rainforest in the last 35 years.[*clarification needed*] Many species are now critically endangered, such as the Sumatran ground cuckoo, the Sumatran tiger, the Sumatran elephant, the Sumatran rhinoceros, and the Sumatran orangutan. Deforestation on the island has also resulted in serious seasonal smoke haze over neighbouring countries, such as the 2013 Southeast Asian haze which caused considerable tensions between Indonesia and affected countries Malaysia and Singapore.[2] The widespread deforestation and other environmental destruction in Sumatra and other parts of Indonesia has often been described by academics as an ecocide.[3][4][5][6][7]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nSumatra was known in ancient times by the Sanskrit names of *Suwarnadwīpa* ('Island of Gold') and *Suwarnabhūmi* ('Land of Gold'), because of the gold deposits in the island's highlands.[8] The earliest known mention of the current form \"Sumatra\" was in 1017, when the local king Haji Sumatrabhumi (\"king of the land of Sumatra\")[9] sent an envoy to China. Arab geographers referred to the island as *Lamri* (*Lamuri*, *Lambri* or *Ramni*) in the tenth through thirteenth centuries, in reference to a kingdom near modern-day Banda Aceh which was the first landfall for traders. The island has also been known by other names, including *Andalas*[10] or *Percha Island*.[11]\n\n\nIn the late 13th century, Marco Polo referred to the kingdom as *Samara*, while his contemporary fellow Italian traveller Odoric of Pordenone used the form *Sumoltra*. Later in the 14th century the local form \"Sumatra\" became popular abroad due to the rising power of the kingdom of Samudera Pasai and the subsequent Sultanate of Aceh.[12][13]\n\n\nFrom then on, subsequent European writers mostly used *Sumatra* or similar forms of the name for the entire island.[14][15]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Batak warriors, 1870\nBy the year 692, the Melayu Kingdom was absorbed by Srivijaya.[16]: 79–80 Srivijaya's influence waned in the 11th century, specifically in the year 1025, after suffering defeat at the hands of the Chola Empire in southern India[17] By the end of the 12th century, Srivijaya had been reduced to a kingdom, and its dominant role in South Sumatra ended with the last king, Ratu Sekekhummong, who founded the milestone of Kepaksian Sekala Brak in the 13th century AD with the Dalom building.[17][18] At the same time, the spread of Islam in Indonesia occurred gradually and indirectly, starting from the western regions of Indonesia such as the Sumatra area which became the first place for the spread of Islam in the archipelago then Java to the eastern regions of Indonesia, Sulawesi and Maluku.[19] The island of Sumatra is also an area in the archipelago that received the spread of Islam first compared to other islands or other areas.[19] The island of Sumatra became the first area to receive the spread of Islam because of the position of the island of Sumatra which is close to the Malacca strait.[19] The initial process of Islamization related to trade and also the formation of the kingdom.[19] Islam entered Sumatra through pious Arabs and Tamil traders in the 6th and 7th centuries AD.[20][21][22] p.129 n.42</ref> At the beginning and end of the 13th century the formation of the kingdom, the king of the Samudra kingdom had converted to Islam. Marco Polo visited the island in 1292, and his fellow Italian Odoric of Pordenone in 1321.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Baiturrahman Grand Mosque in Banda Aceh\n![](image)Kesawan Road in Medan, circa 1900\nAceh in the north of Sumatra became known in the 16th century as trading centre for the pepper trade by shipping quality piperaceae (*pepper*). Aceh became the main commercial centre of the Aceh Sultanate and trading routes were established to the Mediterranean via the Red Sea to rival the Portuguese shipping lanes. The reign of Iskandar Muda is known as the *golden age* of Sumatra because he extended the cultural influence of the Aceh Sultanate to Padang and Johor.[23] The Aceh Sultanate sustained the rivalry with the Johor sultanate, the Dutch, and the Portuguese throughout the 16th and 17th century. When the Dutch were weakened in the 18th century the British empire began to actively intervene in Aceh, establishing close relations between Banda Aceh and Penang. In the 17th and 18th century the Aceh Sultanate battled the Siak sultanate in the south of Sumatra. The port city of Banda Aceh was recorded in European historical writings since the 13th century. In terms of economic development the port of Banda Aceh only started to face competition in the 18th century when more ports were constructed in Sumatra for maritime transport. Nevertheless, major pepper suppliers used the port of Banda Aceh at the beginning of the 19th century. The port in Medan grew swiftly in the late 19th and early 20th century. Meanwhile the medium sized port of Palembang faced a stiff economic decline as the heritage of the Srivijaya empire was superseded by the economic policy of the Singhasari and Majapahit. The Palembang sultanate experienced a terminal decline in the early 19th century.[24]\n\n\nWith the coming of the Dutch Empire, the many Sumatran princely states gradually fell under their control. Aceh posed major obstacles, as the Dutch were involved in the long and costly Aceh War (1873–1903).\n\n\nThe Free Aceh Movement fought against Indonesian government forces in the Aceh Insurgency from 1976 to 2005.[25] Security crackdowns in 2001 and 2002 resulted in several thousand civilian deaths.[26]\n\n\nThe island was heavily impacted by both the 1883 Krakatoa eruption and the 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami.\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1971  | 20,808,148 | —     |\n| 1980  | 28,016,160 | +34.6% |\n| 1990  | 36,506,703 | +30.3% |\n| 1995  | 40,830,334 | +11.8% |\n| 2000  | 42,616,164 | +4.4% |\n| 2005  | 45,839,041 | +7.6% |\n| 2010  | 50,613,947 | +10.4% |\n| 2015  | 55,198,752 | +9.1% |\n| 2020  | 58,557,211 | +6.1% |\n| 2022  | 59,977,300 | +2.4% |\n| sources:[27][28] |\n\n\nSumatra is not particularly densely populated, with an average of about 126 people per km2 – about 59,977,300  people in total (according to official estimates as at mid 2022).[29] Because of its size, it is nonetheless the fifth[30] most populous island in the world.\n\n\n\n* ![Minangkabau women carrying platters of food to a ceremony](image)\n\nMinangkabau women carrying platters of food to a ceremony\n* ![Traditional house in Simalungun North Sumatra](image)\n\nTraditional house in Simalungun North Sumatra\n\n## Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nThe largest indigenous ethnic groups in Sumatra are Malays, Minangkabaus, Bataks, Acehnese, and Lampungs. Other major non-indigenous ethnic groups are Javanese, Sundanese, and Chinese.\n\n\nBelow are 11 largest ethnic groups in Sumatra based on the 2010 census (including Riau Islands, Bangka Belitung, Nias, Mentawai, Simeulue and islands around it)[31]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Ethnic groups\n | Population\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Javanese | 15,239,275\n |\n| Bataks | 7,302,330\n |\n| Minangkabau | 5,799,001\n |\n| Ethnic groups from South Sumatera\n | 4,826,272\n |\n| Malays | 4,016,182\n |\n| Ethnic groups from Aceh\n | 3,991,883\n |\n| Ethnic groups from Jambi\n | 1,379,351\n |\n| Sundanese | 1,231,888\n |\n| Ethnic groups from Lampung\n | 1,109,601\n |\n| Nias | 1,021,267\n |\n| Other\n | 2,086,804\n |\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nSpeakers of Acehnese.\nThere are over 52 languages spoken, all of which (except Chinese and Tamil) belong to the Malayo-Polynesian branch of the Austronesian language family. Within Malayo-Polynesian, they are divided into several sub-branches: Chamic (which are represented by Acehnese in which its closest relatives are languages spoken by Ethnic Chams in Cambodia and Vietnam), Malayic (Malay, Minangkabau and other closely related languages), Northwest Sumatra–Barrier Islands (Batak languages, Gayo and others), Lampungic (includes Proper Lampung and Komering) and Bornean (represented by Rejang in which its closest linguistic relatives are Bukar Sadong and Land Dayak spoken in West Kalimantan and Sarawak (Malaysia)). Northwest Sumatra–Barrier Islands and Lampungic branches are endemic to the island. Like all parts of Indonesia, Indonesian (which was based on Riau Malay) is the official language and the main lingua franca. Although Sumatra has its own local lingua franca, variants of Malay like Medan Malay and Palembang Malay[32] are popular in North and South Sumatra, especially in urban areas. Minangkabau (Padang dialect)[33] is popular in West Sumatra, some parts of North Sumatra, Bengkulu, Jambi and Riau (especially in Pekanbaru and areas bordered with West Sumatra) while Acehnese is also used as an inter-ethnic means of communication in some parts of Aceh province.\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nReligion in Sumatra (2022)[34]\n\n\n\nIslam (87.32%)\nProtestantism (9.21%)\nRoman Catholic (1.68%)\nBuddhism (1.39%)\nHinduism (0.32%)\nConfucianism (0.061%)\nFolk religion (0.02%)\n\nThe majority of people in Sumatra are Muslims (87.1%), while 10.7% are Christians, and less than 2% are Buddhists and Hindus.[35]\n\n\n\n## Administration[edit]\n\n\nSumatra is one of seven geographical regions of Indonesia, which includes its adjacent smaller islands. Sumatra was one of the eight original provinces of Indonesia between 1945 and 1948. Including adjacent archipelagoes normally included with Sumatra (such as the Riau Islands, Nias and the Bangka-Belitung group), it now covers ten of Indonesia's 37 provinces, which are set out below with their areas and populations.[36]\n\n\n\n\n\nProvinces within the region of Sumatra\n| Name | Area (km2) | Populationcensus2000 | Populationcensus2010 | Populationcensus2015 | Populationcensus2020 | Populationestimate2022 | Capital\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Aceh | 56,834.75 | 4,073,006 | 4,486,570 | 4,993,385 | 5,274,871 | 5,407,900 | Banda Aceh |\n| ![](image) North Sumatra (*Sumatra Utara*) | 72,460.74 | 11,642,488 | 12,326,678 | 13,923,262 | 14,799,361 | 15,115,200 | Medan |\n| ![](image) West Sumatra (*Sumatra Barat*) | 42,119.54 | 4,248,515 | 4,846,909 | 5,190,577 | 5,534,472 | 5,640,600 | Padang |\n| ![](image) Riau | 89,935.90 | 3,907,763 | 5,543,031 | 6,330,941 | 6,394,097 | 6,614,400 | Pekanbaru |\n| ![](image) Riau Islands (*Kepulauan Riau*) | 8,269.71 | 1,040,207 | 1,685,698 | 1,968,313 | 2,064,564 | 2,179,800 | Tanjung Pinang |\n| ![](image) Jambi | 49,026.58 | 2,407,166 | 3,088,618 | 3,397,164 | 3,548,228 | 3,631,100 | Jambi |\n| ![](image) South Sumatra  (*Sumatra Selatan*) | 86,771.68 | 6,210,800 | 7,446,401 | 8,043,042 | 8,467,432 | 8,657,000 | Palembang |\n| ![](image) Bengkulu | 20,128.34 | 1,455,500 | 1,713,393 | 1,872,136 | 2,010,670 | 2,060,100 | Bengkulu |\n| ![](image) Lampung | 33,570.26 | 6,730,751 | 7,596,115 | 8,109,601 | 9,007,848 | 9,176,600 | Bandar Lampung |\n| ![](image) Bangka Belitung Islands  (*Kepulauan Bangka Belitung*) | 16,690.13 | 899,968 | 1,223,048 | 1,370,331 | 1,455,678 | 1,494,600 | Pangkal Pinang |\n| ***Totals*** | 475,807.63 | 42,616,164 | 50,613,947 | 55,198,752 | 58,557,211 | 59,977,300\n |\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of geological formation of Sumatra island\n![](image)Mount Sinabung, North Sumatra\nThe longest axis of the island runs approximately 1,790 km (1,110 mi) northwest–southeast, crossing the equator near the centre. At its widest point, the island spans 435 km (270 mi). The interior of the island is dominated by two geographical regions: the Barisan Mountains in the west and swampy plains in the east. Sumatra is the closest Indonesian island to mainland Asia.\n\n\nTo the southeast is Java, separated by the Sunda Strait. To the north is the Malay Peninsula (located on the Asian mainland), separated by the Strait of Malacca. To the east is Borneo, across the Karimata Strait. West of the island is the Indian Ocean.\n\n\nThe Great Sumatran fault (a strike-slip fault), and the Sunda megathrust (a subduction zone), run the entire length of the island along its west coast. On 26 December 2004, the western coast and islands of Sumatra, particularly Aceh province, were struck by a tsunami following the Indian Ocean earthquake. This was the longest earthquake recorded, lasting between 500 and 600 seconds (8.33–10 minutes).[37] More than 170,000 Indonesians were killed, primarily in Aceh. Other recent earthquakes to strike Sumatra include the 2005 Nias–Simeulue earthquake and the 2010 Mentawai earthquake and tsunami.\n\n\nLake Toba is the site of a supervolcanic eruption that occurred around 74,000 years ago, representing a climate-changing event.[38] The most important rivers in Sumatra belong to the catchment area of the South China Sea. Heading north to south, the Asahan, Rokan, Siak, Kampar, Indragiri, Batanghari flow into the Malacca Strait, while the island's largest river, the Musi, flows into the sea at Bangka Strait in the south. To the east, big rivers carry silt from the mountains, forming the vast lowland interspersed by swamps. Even if mostly unsuitable for farming, the area is currently of great economic importance for Indonesia. It produces oil from both above and below the soil – palm oil and petroleum.\n\n\nSumatra is the largest producer of Indonesian coffee. Small-holders grow Arabica coffee (*Coffea arabica*) in the highlands, while Robusta (*Coffea canephora*) is found in the lowlands. Arabica coffee from the regions of Gayo, Lintong and Sidikilang is typically processed using the Giling Basah (wet hulling) technique, which gives it a heavy body and low acidity.[39]\n\n\nSumatra is a highly seismic island. Huge earthquakes have been recorded throughout history. In 1797, an 8.9 earthquake shook Western Sumatra, and in 1833, a 9.2 earthquake shook Bengkulu and Western Sumatra. Both events caused large tsunamis. Earthquakes are very common throughout the coastal area of the west and center of the island, and tsunamis are common due to the high seismicity in the area.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Largest cities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Medan, the largest city in Sumatra\nBy population, Medan is the largest city in Sumatra.[40] Medan is also the most visited and developed city in Sumatra.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | City\n | Province\n | City Birthday\n | Area (in km2)\n | Population  2010 census\n | Population  2020 census\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | **Medan** | North Sumatra | 1 July 1590\n | 265.10\n | 2,097,610\n | 2,435,252\n |\n| 2\n | **Palembang** | South Sumatra | 17 June 683\n | 400.61\n | 1,455,284\n | 1,668,848\n |\n| 3\n | **Bandar Lampung** | Lampung | 17 June 1682\n | 169.21\n | 881,801\n | 1,166,066\n |\n| 4\n | **Pekanbaru** | Riau | 23 June 1784\n | 633.01\n | 897,767\n | 983,356\n |\n| 5\n | **Padang** | West Sumatra | 7 August 1669\n | 694.96\n | 833,562\n | 909,040\n |\n| 6\n | **Jambi** | Jambi | 17 May 1946\n | 205.00\n | 531,857\n | 606,200\n |\n| 7\n | **Bengkulu** | Bengkulu | 18 March 1719\n | 144.52\n | 308,544\n | 373,591\n |\n| 8\n | **Dumai** | Riau | 20 April 1999\n | 2,039.35\n | 253,803\n | 316,782\n |\n| 9\n | **Binjai** | North Sumatra |  | 90.24\n | 246,154\n | 291,842\n |\n| 10\n | **Pematang Siantar** | North Sumatra | 24 April 1871\n | 60.52\n | 234,698\n | 268,254\n |\n| 11\n | **Banda Aceh** | Aceh | 22 April 1205\n | 61.36\n | 223,446\n | 252,899\n |\n| 12\n | **Lubuklinggau** | South Sumatra | 17 August 2001\n | 419.80\n | 201,308\n | 234,166\n |\n\n\n## Flora and fauna[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of national parks of Indonesia and List of amphibians of Sumatra\n\n![](image)Sumatran tiger\n![](image)*Rafflesia arnoldii*\nSumatra supports a wide range of vegetation types that are home to a rich variety of species, including 17 endemic genera of plants.[41] Unique species include the Sumatran pine which dominates the Sumatran tropical pine forests of the higher mountainsides in the north of the island and rainforest plants such as *Rafflesia arnoldii* (the world's largest individual flower), and the titan arum (the world's largest unbranched inflorescence).\n\n\nThe island is home to 201 mammal species and 580 bird species. There are nine endemic mammal species on mainland Sumatra and 14 more endemic to the nearby Mentawai Islands.[41] There are about 300 freshwater fish species in Sumatra.[42] There are 93 amphibian species in Sumatra, 21 of which are endemic to Sumatra.[43]\n\n\nThe Sumatran tiger, Sumatran rhinoceros, Sumatran elephant, Sumatran ground cuckoo, Sumatran orangutan and Tapanuli orangutan are all critically endangered, indicating the highest level of threat to their survival. In October 2008, the Indonesian government announced a plan to protect Sumatra's remaining forests.[44]\n\n\nThe island includes more than 10 national parks, including three which are listed as the Tropical Rainforest Heritage of Sumatra World Heritage Site – Gunung Leuser National Park, Kerinci Seblat National Park and Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park. The Berbak National Park is one of three national parks in Indonesia listed as a wetland of international importance under the Ramsar Convention.\n\n\nSumatra has lost almost 50% of its tropical rainforest in the last 35 years.[*clarification needed*] Many species are now critically endangered, such as the Sumatran ground cuckoo, the Sumatran tiger, the Sumatran elephant, the Sumatran rhinoceros, and the Sumatran orangutan. Deforestation on the island has also resulted in serious seasonal smoke haze over neighbouring countries, such as the 2013 Southeast Asian haze which caused considerable tensions between Indonesia and affected countries Malaysia and Singapore.[2] The widespread deforestation and other environmental destruction in Sumatra and other parts of Indonesia has often been described by academics as an ecocide.[3][4][5][6]\n\n\n\n## Rail transport[edit]\n\n\nSeveral unconnected railway networks built during Netherlands East Indies exist in Sumatra, such as the ones connecting Banda Aceh-Lhokseumawe-Besitang-Medan-Tebingtinggi-Pematang Siantar-Rantau Prapat in Northern Sumatra (the Banda Aceh-Besitang section was closed in 1971, but is currently being rebuilt).[45] Padang-Solok-Bukittinggi in West Sumatra, and Bandar Lampung-Palembang-Lahat-Lubuk Linggau in Southern Sumatra.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Indonesia portal\n* ![icon](image)Islands portal\n\n\n* Architecture of Sumatra\n* Bukit Seguntang\n* Communism in Sumatra\n* Music of Sumatra\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The *Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia* states that *Sumatra* is the correct spelling in Indonesian;[1] however, it is popularly and legislatively spelled in Indonesian as *Sumatera*.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Hasil Pencarian – KBBI Daring\" [Entry for \"Sumatra\" in the online version of the *Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia*]. *kbbi.kemdikbud.go.id* (in Indonesian).

The island separates the Sea of Japan, which lies to its north and west, from the North Pacific Ocean to the south and east. It is the seventh-largest island in the world, and the second-most populous after the Indonesian island of Java.[8][9][10]\n\n\nHonshu had a population of 104 million as of 2017[update], constituting 81.3% of the entire population of Japan,[11] and mostly concentrated in the coastal areas and plains. Approximately 30% of the total population resides in the Greater Tokyo Area on the Kantō Plain. As the historical center of Japanese cultural and political power,[12] the island includes several past Japanese capitals, including Kyōto, Nara, and Kamakura. Much of the island's southern shore forms part of the Taiheiyō Belt, a megalopolis that spans several of the Japanese islands.[12] Honshu contains Japan's highest mountain, Mount Fuji, and its largest lake, Lake Biwa.[13]\n\n\nMost of Japan's industry is located in a belt running along Honshu's southern coast, from Tokyo to Nagoya, Kyōto, Osaka, Kobe, and Hiroshima;[12] by contrast, the economy along the northwestern Sea of Japan coast is largely based on fishing and agriculture.[14] The island is linked to the other three major Japanese islands by a number of bridges and tunnels. The island primarily shares two climates, with Northern Honshu having a mainly humid continental climate while the south has a humid subtropical climate.[15]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nThe name of the island, Honshū (本州), directly translates to \"main province\" in English.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\nHumans first arrived in Honshu about 60,000 years ago. [16]\n\n\n\n### Meiji Restoration[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | **This section is empty.** You can help by adding to it. *(February 2023)*\n |\n\n\n### World War II[edit]\n\n\nHonshu was the target of devastating air raids during the Pacific War of World War II. The first air raid to strike Honshu and the other home islands was the Doolittle Raid. With the introduction of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress, the firebombing of Tokyo culminated in Operation Meetinghouse, the most destructive air raid in human history, which destroyed 16 square miles (41 km2; 10,000 acres) of central Tokyo, leaving an estimated 100,000 civilians dead, and over one million homeless.[17] The war ended with the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki shortly before Japan's surrender and signing of the Japanese Instrument of Surrender on September 2, 1945, on board the USS *Missouri* (BB-63) in Tokyo Bay.\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Japan as seen from a satellite. Honshu is the largest, middle island.\nThe island is roughly 1,300 km (810 mi) long and ranges from 50 to 230 km (31 to 143 mi) wide, and its total area is 227,960 km2 (88,020 sq mi),[1] making it slightly larger than the island of Great Britain 209,331 km2 (80,823 sq mi).[10] Its land area has been increasing with land reclamation and coastal uplift in the north due to plate tectonics with a convergent boundary. Honshu has 10,084 kilometres (6,266 mi) of coastline.[7]\n\n\nMountainous and volcanic, Honshu experiences frequent earthquakes (the Great Kantō earthquake heavily damaged Tokyo in September 1923, and the earthquake of March 2011 moved the northeastern part of the island by varying amounts of as much as 5.3 m (17 ft)[18][19] while causing devastating tsunamis). The highest peak is the active volcano Mount Fuji at 3,776 m (12,388 ft), which makes Honshu the world's 7th highest island. There are many rivers, including the Shinano River, Japan's longest. The Japanese Alps span the width of Honshu, from the 'Sea of Japan' coast to the Pacific shore. The climate is generally humid subtropical in western Japan and humid continental in the north.\n\n\n\n### Population[edit]\n\n\nHonshu has a total population of 104 million people, according to a 2017 estimate, 81.3% of the entire population of Japan.[11] The largest city is Tokyo (population: 13,988,129),[20] the capital of Japan and part of the Greater Tokyo Area, the most populous metropolitan area in the world.\n\n\n\n### Extreme points[edit]\n\n\n#### Bridges and tunnels[edit]\n\n\nHonshu is connected to the islands of Hokkaidō, Kyūshū and Shikoku by tunnels and bridges. Three bridge systems have been built across the islands of the Inland Sea between Honshu and Shikoku (Akashi Kaikyo Bridge and the Ōnaruto Bridge; Shin-Onomichi Bridge, Innoshima Bridge, Ikuchi Bridge, Tatara Bridge, Ōmishima Bridge, Hakata–Ōshima Bridge, and the Kurushima Kaikyō Bridge; Shimotsui-Seto Bridge, Hitsuishijima Bridge, Iwakurojima Bridge, Yoshima Bridge, Kita Bisan-Seto Bridge, and the Minami Bisan-Seto Bridge), the Seikan Tunnel connects Honshu with Hokkaidō, and the Kanmonkyo Bridge and Kanmon Tunnel connects Honshu with Kyūshū.\n\n\n\n### Flora and fauna[edit]\n\n\nThese are notable flora and fauna of Honshu.\n\n\n\n\n\nNotable flora and fauna[21]\n| Name | Type\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Japanese black bear | Fauna\n | A subspecies of the Asian black bear.

It was the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in Japan, and the fourth most powerful earthquake in the world since modern record-keeping began in 1900.[22][23][24] The tsunami subsequently led to the meltdown of 3 nuclear reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, leading to the Fukushima nuclear disaster.\n\n\n\n### Parks[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mount Fuji seen from Lake Motosu in Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park\n\n\nNational parks (国立公園)\n| Minami Alps National Park | 南アルプス\n |\n| Chūbu-Sangaku National Park | 中部山岳\n |\n| Hakusan National Park | 白山\n |\n| Myōkō-Togakushi Renzan National Park | 妙高戸隠連山\n |\n| Daisen-Oki National Park | 大山隠岐\n |\n| Chichibu Tama Kai National Park | 秩父多摩甲斐\n |\n| Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park | 富士箱根伊豆\n |\n| Jōshin'etsu-kōgen National Park | 上信越高原\n |\n| Nikkō National Park | 日光国立公園\n |\n| Ogasawara National Park | 小笠原\n |\n| Ise-Shima National Park | 伊勢志摩\n |\n| Sanin Kaigan National Park | 山陰海岸\n |\n| Yoshino-Kumano National Park | 吉野熊野\n |\n| Setonaikai National Park | 瀬戸内海\n |\n| Bandai-Asahi National Park | 磐梯朝日\n |\n| Sanriku Fukkō National Park | 三陸復興\n |\n| Towada-Hachimantai National Park | 十和田八幡平\n |\n| Oze National Park | 尾瀬\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Region | List of Quasi-National Parks\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Tōhoku | Shimokita Hantō, Tsugaru, Hayachine, Kurikoma, Minami Sanriku Kinkasan, Zaō, Oga, Chōkai |\n| Kantō | Suigō-Tsukuba, Minami Bōsō, Meiji no Mori Takao, Tanzawa-Ōyama |\n| Chūbu | Echigo Sanzan-Tadami, Myōgi-Arafune-Saku Kōgen, Sado-Yahiko-Yoneyama, Noto Hantō, Echizen-Kaga Kaigan, Yatsugatake-Chūshin Kōgen, Tenryū-Okumikawa, Chūō Alps, Ibi-Sekigahara-Yōrō, Hida-Kisogawa, Aichi Kōgen, Mikawa-wan |\n| Kansai | Suzuka, Wakasa Wan, Tango-Amanohashidate-Ōeyama, Biwako, Murō-Akame-Aoyama, Kongō-Ikoma-Kisen, Yamato-Aogaki, Kōya-Ryūjin, Meiji no Mori Minō, Kyoto Tamba Kogen |\n| Chūgoku | Hyōnosen-Ushiroyama-Nagisan, Hiba-Dōgo-Taishaku, Nishi-Chūgoku Sanchi, Kita-Nagato Kaigan, Akiyoshidai |\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nHonshu island generates around US$3.5 trillion or more than 80% of Japan's GDP.[25]\n\n\n\n### Agriculture[edit]\n\n\nFruit, vegetables, grains, rice and cotton make up the main produce grown in Honshu.[26] The Tohoku region, spanning the north-eastern part of the island, is notable for its rice production, with 65% of cultivated land being rice paddy fields – almost a quarter of all paddy fields in Japan.[27] Chiba Prefecture is famous for its peanuts, also being the largest producer in Japan.[28] Rare species of the lichen genus Menegazzia are found only in Honshu.[29]\n\n\n\n### Industry[edit]\n\n\nMost of Japan's tea and silk is from Honshu.[26] Japan's three largest industrial regions are all located on Honshu: the Keihin region, the Hanshin Industrial Region, and the Chūkyō Industrial Area.\n\n\n\n### Minerals and fuels[edit]\n\n\nHonshu is home to a large portion[30] of Japan's minimal mineral reserves,[31] including small oil and coal deposits. Several coal deposits are located in the northern part of the island,[32] concentrated in Fukushima Prefecture and Niigata Prefecture, though Honshu's coal production is negligible in comparison to Hokkaido and Kyushu.[33] Most of Japan's oil reserves are also located in northern Honshu, along the west coast, spanning Niigata, Yamagata, and Akita Prefectures.[34]\n\n\nMost of Japan's copper, lead, zinc and chromite is located on Honshu, along with smaller, scattered deposits of gold, silver, arsenic, sulfur and pyrite.[35]\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\nThe Tokaido Shinkansen, opened in 1964 between Tokyo and Shin-Ōsaka, is Japan's first high-speed rail line.[36] It is the world's oldest high-speed rail line and one of the most heavily used.[37][38] The San'yō Shinkansen, connects the two largest cities in western Japan, Shin-Osaka in Osaka with Hakata Station in Fukuoka. Both the Tokaido Shinkansen and the Sanyo Shinkansen help form a continuous high-speed railway through the Taiheiyō Belt megalopolis.\n\n\n\n![](image)Mt. Fuji and the Tokaido Shinkansen\n## Administrative regions and prefectures[edit]\n\n\nThe island is divided into five nominal regions and contains 34 prefectures, including metropolitan Tokyo. Administratively, some smaller islands are included within these prefectures, notably including the Ogasawara Islands, Sado Island, Izu Ōshima, and Awaji Island.\n\n\nThe regions and their prefectures are:\n\n\n\n* **Tōhoku region** consists of six prefectures.\n\t+ ![](image) Akita Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Aomori Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Fukushima Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Iwate Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Miyagi Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Yamagata Prefecture\n* **Kantō region** consists of seven prefectures, including the capital of Japan which is the Tokyo Metropolis.\n\t+ ![](image) Chiba Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Gunma Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Ibaraki Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Kanagawa Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Saitama Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Tochigi Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Tokyo\n* **Chūbu region** consists of nine prefectures.\n\t+ ![](image) Aichi Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Fukui Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Gifu Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Ishikawa Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Nagano Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Niigata Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Shizuoka Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Toyama Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Yamanashi Prefecture\n* **Kansai region** consists of seven prefectures.\n\t+ ![](image) Hyōgo Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Kyoto Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Mie Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Nara Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Osaka Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Shiga Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Wakayama Prefecture\n* **Chūgoku region** consists of five prefectures.\n\t+ ![](image) Hiroshima Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Okayama Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Shimane Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Tottori Prefecture\n\t+ ![](image) Yamaguchi Prefecture\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Japan portal\n* ![icon](image)Islands portal\n\n\n* Geography of Japan\n* Hokkaido\n* Japanese archipelago\n* Kyushu\n* Okinawa\n* Shikoku\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Farjon, Aljos; Filer, Denis (2013). *An Atlas of the World's Conifers: An Analysis of their Distribution, Biogeography, Diversity and Conservation Status*.
