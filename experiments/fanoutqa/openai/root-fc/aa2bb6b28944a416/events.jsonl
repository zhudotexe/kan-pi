Please help improve it by revising it to be neutral and encyclopedic. *(February 2021)*\n |\n\n\nHMC employs financial professionals to manage the approximately 12,000 funds that constitute the endowment. The company directly manages about one third of the total endowment portfolio while working closely with the external companies that manage the rest.[*citation needed*] HMC is headed by a professional, who holds the titles of president and chief executive officer of the company.\n\n\nHMC is a 501(c)(3) non-profit entity[5] and so is exempt from federal income taxation.[6]\n\n\n\n### Past management[edit]\n\n\nJack Meyer managed HMC from 1990 to September 30, 2005, beginning with an endowment worth $4.8 billion and ending with a value of $25.9 billion (including new contributions). During the last decade of his tenure, the endowment earned an annualized return of 15.9%.[7] In part after compensation disagreements, a number of HMC managers including Meyer himself left to form their own investment management firms. Bloomberg in 2011 reviewed a group of the resultant firms—Adage Capital Management LP, Charlesbank Capital Partners LLC, Convexity Capital Management LP (Meyer's), Highfields Capital Management LP and Regiment Capital Advisors LLC—which at that time between them managed $43 billion in assets.[8]\n\n\nThe university hired Mohamed El-Erian to succeed Meyer as HMC's next president and CEO. He came from the bond trading company PIMCO and pledged to \"rebuild and reinvent\" the company. He announced his leaving September 12, 2007, to return to PIMCO after guiding the endowment to a one-year return of 23%.[9]\n\n\nJane Mendillo was named the new head of HMC, effective July 1, 2008. She had been Wellesley College’s chief investment officer since 2002. Prior to that, she served as vice president for external management at HMC. A 1984 graduate of Yale University followed by an MBA from Yale School of Management, Mendillo first joined HMC as an equities analyst in 1987. Her tenure was largely shaped by the financial crisis of 2007–2010, with a cash squeeze in University operation and endowment performance, a shrinkage of endowment asset value, and errant interest rate, financial derivatives and leveraged positions, according to a Feb. 2009 news report. Staff of HMC was trimmed 25%, or by about 50 people, in line with shrinkage of about $8 billion (about 22%). A source for the report said that some of the positions in the endowment which had to be liquidated were in hedge funds run by Meyer's Convexity Capital and Seth Klarman's Baupost Group.[10]\n\n\nStephen Blyth became the CEO of HMC on January 1, 2015. Blyth joined the firm in 2006, and previously held roles as Head of Internal Management and Head of Public Markets, responsible for investments in public equity, credit and fixed income markets. An alumnus of Cambridge University and Harvard University, Blyth has also served as a Professor of the Practice of Statistics at Harvard University.[11]\n\n\nMarc Seidner joined HMC as vice president for domestic fixed income in an effort to revamp the company's bond division in 2006. Mr. Seidner was previously the director of active core strategies at Standish Mellon Asset Management.[12] *The Wall Street Journal* reported on June 23, 2009, that Seidner was departing from the organization. On August 14, 2009 PIMCO announced that it had hired Seidner as an executive vice president and portfolio manager to manage a range of fixed-income portfolios.\n\n\n\n### Current management[edit]\n\n\nOn September 30, 2016, N.P. Narvekar was appointed as CEO.[13] In January 2017, Narvekar announced the company would be laying off about half of the 230-employee staff by outsourcing some positions and closing all its internally managed hedge funds by the end of the 2017 fiscal year.[14] In 2019, Narvekar was paid $9.3 million compensation.[15][16]\n\n\n\n### Harken Energy[edit]\n\n\nIn 2002, Harvard Management Company was linked to George W. Bush's Harken Energy scandal.[17][18] Specifically, Michael R. Eisenson, who would later found private equity firm Charlesbank Capital Partners was the Harvard representative on the Harken Energy board when Harvard made a $30 million investment into the ill-fated oil company venture.[19] At the time, employees were accused of improperly investing their own money into Harken but Harvard deemed those investments appropriate.[20]\n\n\n\n### Investments in Romania[edit]\n\n\nFrom 2004 to 2015 Harvard University acquired 33,600 hectares (83,000 acres) of Romanian forest land. In 2015 they abruptly sold their entire holding to a subsidiary of Ikea. These holdings have since faced significant legal challenge as many were acquired corruptly during Romania's post-Communist restitution process.[21]\n\n\n\n### Ending investments in fossil fuels[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2021, after years of pressure from student and outside groups, Harvard announced that it will stop investments in fossil fuels.[22] The university's public announcement cited \"the need to decarbonize the economy and our responsibility as fiduciaries\" in explaining its decision.[23] Climate activists on campus had waged a multi-year campaign for full divestment, including bringing lawsuits, storming the field of the 2019 Harvard-Yale football game, organizing on-campus protests, and other strategies.[24]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of colleges and universities in the United States by endowment\n* List of wealthiest charitable foundations\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Virginia L.

Please help improve it by revising it to be neutral and encyclopedic. *(February 2021)*\n |\n\n\nHMC employs financial professionals to manage the approximately 12,000 funds that constitute the endowment. The company directly manages about one third of the total endowment portfolio while working closely with the external companies that manage the rest.[*citation needed*] HMC is headed by a professional, who holds the titles of president and chief executive officer of the company.\n\n\nHMC is a 501(c)(3) non-profit entity[5] and so is exempt from federal income taxation.[6]\n\n\n\n### Past management[edit]\n\n\nJack Meyer managed HMC from 1990 to September 30, 2005, beginning with an endowment worth $4.8 billion and ending with a value of $25.9 billion (including new contributions). During the last decade of his tenure, the endowment earned an annualized return of 15.9%.[7] In part after compensation disagreements, a number of HMC managers including Meyer himself left to form their own investment management firms. Bloomberg in 2011 reviewed a group of the resultant firms—Adage Capital Management LP, Charlesbank Capital Partners LLC, Convexity Capital Management LP (Meyer's), Highfields Capital Management LP and Regiment Capital Advisors LLC—which at that time between them managed $43 billion in assets.[8]\n\n\nThe university hired Mohamed El-Erian to succeed Meyer as HMC's next president and CEO. He came from the bond trading company PIMCO and pledged to \"rebuild and reinvent\" the company. He announced his leaving September 12, 2007, to return to PIMCO after guiding the endowment to a one-year return of 23%.[9]\n\n\nJane Mendillo was named the new head of HMC, effective July 1, 2008. She had been Wellesley College’s chief investment officer since 2002. Prior to that, she served as vice president for external management at HMC. A 1984 graduate of Yale University followed by an MBA from Yale School of Management, Mendillo first joined HMC as an equities analyst in 1987. Her tenure was largely shaped by the financial crisis of 2007–2010, with a cash squeeze in University operation and endowment performance, a shrinkage of endowment asset value, and errant interest rate, financial derivatives and leveraged positions, according to a Feb. 2009 news report. Staff of HMC was trimmed 25%, or by about 50 people, in line with shrinkage of about $8 billion (about 22%). A source for the report said that some of the positions in the endowment which had to be liquidated were in hedge funds run by Meyer's Convexity Capital and Seth Klarman's Baupost Group.[10]\n\n\nStephen Blyth became the CEO of HMC on January 1, 2015. Blyth joined the firm in 2006, and previously held roles as Head of Internal Management and Head of Public Markets, responsible for investments in public equity, credit and fixed income markets. An alumnus of Cambridge University and Harvard University, Blyth has also served as a Professor of the Practice of Statistics at Harvard University.[11]\n\n\nMarc Seidner joined HMC as vice president for domestic fixed income in an effort to revamp the company's bond division in 2006. Mr. Seidner was previously the director of active core strategies at Standish Mellon Asset Management.[12] *The Wall Street Journal* reported on June 23, 2009, that Seidner was departing from the organization. On August 14, 2009 PIMCO announced that it had hired Seidner as an executive vice president and portfolio manager to manage a range of fixed-income portfolios.\n\n\n\n### Current management[edit]\n\n\nOn September 30, 2016, N.P. Narvekar was appointed as CEO.[13] In January 2017, Narvekar announced the company would be laying off about half of the 230-employee staff by outsourcing some positions and closing all its internally managed hedge funds by the end of the 2017 fiscal year.[14] In 2019, Narvekar was paid $9.3 million compensation.[15][16]\n\n\n\n### Harken Energy[edit]\n\n\nIn 2002, Harvard Management Company was linked to George W. Bush's Harken Energy scandal.[17][18] Specifically, Michael R. Eisenson, who would later found private equity firm Charlesbank Capital Partners was the Harvard representative on the Harken Energy board when Harvard made a $30 million investment into the ill-fated oil company venture.[19] At the time, employees were accused of improperly investing their own money into Harken but Harvard deemed those investments appropriate.[20]\n\n\n\n### Investments in Romania[edit]\n\n\nFrom 2004 to 2015 Harvard University acquired 33,600 hectares (83,000 acres) of Romanian forest land. In 2015 they abruptly sold their entire holding to a subsidiary of Ikea. These holdings have since faced significant legal challenge as many were acquired corruptly during Romania's post-Communist restitution process.[21]\n\n\n\n### Ending investments in fossil fuels[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2021, after years of pressure from student and outside groups, Harvard announced that it will stop investments in fossil fuels.[22] The university's public announcement cited \"the need to decarbonize the economy and our responsibility as fiduciaries\" in explaining its decision.[23] Climate activists on campus had waged a multi-year campaign for full divestment, including bringing lawsuits, storming the field of the 2019 Harvard-Yale football game, organizing on-campus protests, and other strategies.[24]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of colleges and universities in the United States by endowment\n* List of wealthiest charitable foundations\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Virginia L.

In 1718, Elihu Yale sold a portion of his collection of gems and furniture to provide an initial fund of £562 for the establishment of the school's endowment.[5] From 1985 until 2021, the Chief Investment Officer of Yale was alumnus David Swensen, who was replaced by alumnus Matthew Mendelsohn.[2][3] As of 2013, the chairman of the Yale Investment Committee, which provides oversight of the endowment, was Douglas A. Warner III.[6]\n\n\n\n## Investments and performance[edit]\n\n\nAs of June 30, 2021, the endowment was valued at $42.3 billion.[1] Since the early 1990s, the endowment has generated annual returns for the university of approximately 11.3 percent, with a portion of the annual return forming part of the university's operating budget and the remainder reinvested to grow the size of the endowment.[7] Spending from revenue earned off the endowment accounted for $1.2 billion of the university's operating budget in 2017 and $1.5 billion in 2021.[7][1] The university aims to spend approximately 5.25 percent of the endowment on its annual operating budget.[1]\n\n\nThe endowment has become known for seeking out \"unconventional assets\" and for investments in emerging businesses.[8] In the 1990s it invested in Google and Amazon and was later an early investor in Facebook, LinkedIn, and Airbnb.[8] As of 2016, its venture capital investments had averaged 93-percent returns over the preceding two decades.[9]\n\n\n\n## Issues[edit]\n\n\nIn 2016 the State of Connecticut considered taxing Yale's investment returns as a way of plugging a gap in the state budget.[10] The university objected, in part, on the grounds that such a move would be a violation of the tax exemption guaranteed to the university by the Colony of Connecticut in 1745.[10][11]\n\n\nBeginning in the early 2000s, some criticized the size of compensation given to the endowment's managers.[12] In 2015, Swenson earned $4.5 million, making him the highest-paid employee at the university, surpassing the compensation of even university president Peter Salovey.[12][13] Others have said the salaries of endowment managers are justifiable, asserting that they are less than what could be earned in the private sector and pay for themselves with the endowment's high rates of return.[12]\n\n\nYale's endowment has been widely criticized for its investments in fossil fuel companies, Puerto Rican debt, private prisons, companies which provide services to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, subprime mortgage lending companies, and for other controversial holdings. In December 2018, after years of criticism from campus fossil fuel divestment groups, Yale University arrested 48 student activists for staging a sit-in at the Yale Investment Office to protest Yale’s holdings in the fossil fuel industry and Puerto Rican debt.[14] That same quarter Yale sold 99 percent of its direct investment holdings in Antero Resource Corporation, a natural gas and oil company, according to Yale’s 2018 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.[15]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of colleges and universities in the United States by endowment\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"Yale endowment earns 40.2% investment return in fiscal 2021\". *YaleNews*. 2021-10-14.

In 1718, Elihu Yale sold a portion of his collection of gems and furniture to provide an initial fund of £562 for the establishment of the school's endowment.[5] From 1985 until 2021, the Chief Investment Officer of Yale was alumnus David Swensen, who was replaced by alumnus Matthew Mendelsohn.[2][3] As of 2013, the chairman of the Yale Investment Committee, which provides oversight of the endowment, was Douglas A. Warner III.[6]\n\n\n\n## Investments and performance[edit]\n\n\nAs of June 30, 2021, the endowment was valued at $42.3 billion.[1] Since the early 1990s, the endowment has generated annual returns for the university of approximately 11.3 percent, with a portion of the annual return forming part of the university's operating budget and the remainder reinvested to grow the size of the endowment.[7] Spending from revenue earned off the endowment accounted for $1.2 billion of the university's operating budget in 2017 and $1.5 billion in 2021.[7][1] The university aims to spend approximately 5.25 percent of the endowment on its annual operating budget.[1]\n\n\nThe endowment has become known for seeking out \"unconventional assets\" and for investments in emerging businesses.[8] In the 1990s it invested in Google and Amazon and was later an early investor in Facebook, LinkedIn, and Airbnb.[8] As of 2016, its venture capital investments had averaged 93-percent returns over the preceding two decades.[9]\n\n\n\n## Issues[edit]\n\n\nIn 2016 the State of Connecticut considered taxing Yale's investment returns as a way of plugging a gap in the state budget.[10] The university objected, in part, on the grounds that such a move would be a violation of the tax exemption guaranteed to the university by the Colony of Connecticut in 1745.[10][11]\n\n\nBeginning in the early 2000s, some criticized the size of compensation given to the endowment's managers.[12] In 2015, Swenson earned $4.5 million, making him the highest-paid employee at the university, surpassing the compensation of even university president Peter Salovey.[12][13] Others have said the salaries of endowment managers are justifiable, asserting that they are less than what could be earned in the private sector and pay for themselves with the endowment's high rates of return.[12]\n\n\nYale's endowment has been widely criticized for its investments in fossil fuel companies, Puerto Rican debt, private prisons, companies which provide services to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, subprime mortgage lending companies, and for other controversial holdings. In December 2018, after years of criticism from campus fossil fuel divestment groups, Yale University arrested 48 student activists for staging a sit-in at the Yale Investment Office to protest Yale’s holdings in the fossil fuel industry and Puerto Rican debt.[14] That same quarter Yale sold 99 percent of its direct investment holdings in Antero Resource Corporation, a natural gas and oil company, according to Yale’s 2018 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.[15]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of colleges and universities in the United States by endowment\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"Yale endowment earns 40.2% investment return in fiscal 2021\". *YaleNews*. 2021-10-14.

Stanford University struggled financially after Leland's death in 1893 and again after much of the campus was damaged by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.[15] Following World War II, Frederick Terman, the university's provost, inspired and supported faculty and graduates entrepreneurialism to build a self-sufficient local industry, which would later be known as Silicon Valley.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nStanford is home to the Martin Luther King Jr. Research and Education Institute which grew out of and still contains the Martin Luther King Jr. Papers Project, a collaboration with the King Center to publish the King papers held by the King Center.[156] It also runs the John S.

Groups span athletics and recreation, careers/pre-professional, community service, ethnic/cultural, fraternities and sororities, health and counseling, media and publications, the arts, political and social awareness, and religious and philosophical organizations.

In 1944, University President Donald Tresidder banned all Stanford sororities due to extreme competition.[284] However, following Title IX, the Board of Trustees lifted the 33-year ban on sororities in 1977.[285] Students are not permitted to join a fraternity or sorority until spring quarter of their freshman year.[286]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe central campus includes a seasonal lake (Lake Lagunita, actually an irrigation reservoir), home to the vulnerable California tiger salamander. As of 2012, Lake Lagunita was often dry and the university had no plans to artificially fill it.[85] Heavy rains in January 2023 refilled Lake Lagunita (colloquially known as Lake Lag) to up to 8 feet of depth.[86] Two other reservoirs, Searsville Lake on San Francisquito Creek and Felt Lake,[87] are on more remote sections of the founding grant.\n\n\n\n### Central campus[edit]\n\n\nThe central academic campus is adjacent to Palo Alto,[88] bounded by El Camino Real, Stanford Avenue, Junipero Serra Blvd, and Sand Hill Road. The United States Postal Service has assigned it two ZIP Codes: 94305 for campus mail and 94309 for P.O. box mail.

The winner of the annual \"Big Game\" between the Cal and Cardinal football teams gains custody of the Stanford Axe.[251] As of May 9, 2022, Stanford has won 130 NCAA team championships, more than any other school. Stanford has won at least one NCAA team championship each academic year for 46 consecutive years, starting in 1976–77 and continuing through 2021–22.[252] The second-longest NCAA championship streak was nineteen years, achieved by USC from 1959 to 1960 through 1977–78. As of January 1, 2022, Stanford athletes have won 529 NCAA individual championships. No other Division I school is within 100 of Stanford's total.[253] Stanford won 25 consecutive NACDA Directors' Cups, from 1994 to 1995 through 2018–19, awarded annually to the most successful overall college sports program in the nation.[252]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n293. **^** \"Campus Communities & Service Opportunities: Student Organizations\".

They specified in the founding grant[53] that the buildings should \"be like the old adobe houses of the early Spanish days; they will be one-storied; they will have deep window seats and open fireplaces, and the roofs will be covered with the familiar dark red tiles.\" This guides the campus buildings to this day.

It is awarded not at prescribed intervals, but instead only when the president of the university deems it appropriate to recognize extraordinary service. Recipients include Herbert Hoover, Bill Hewlett, Dave Packard, Lucile Packard, and John Gardner.[277]\n* Former campus traditions include the Big Game bonfire on Lake Lagunita (a seasonal lake usually dry in the fall), which was formally ended in 1997 because of the presence of endangered salamanders in the lake bed.[278]\n\n\n### Religious life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Official website ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n* Stanford Athletics website\n* ![](image) Texts on Wikisource:\n\t+ \"Leland Stanford Jr. University\". *Encyclopædia Britannica* (11th ed.). 1911.\n\t+ \"Leland Stanford Junior University\". *Encyclopedia Americana*. 1920.\n\t+ \"Leland Stanford, Junior, University\". *Collier's New Encyclopedia*. 1921.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Eleven historically National Interfraternity Conference (NIC) fraternities are also represented at Stanford, including five unhoused fraternities (Alpha Epsilon Pi, Delta Kappa Epsilon, Delta Tau Delta, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, and Kappa Alpha Order), and four housed fraternities (Sigma Phi Epsilon, Kappa Sigma, Phi Kappa Psi, and Sigma Nu).

Students compete in 36 varsity sports, and the university is one of two private institutions in the Division I FBS Pac-12 Conference. As of May 26, 2022, Stanford has won 131 NCAA team championships,[17] more than any other university, and was awarded the NACDA Directors' Cup for 25 consecutive years, beginning in 1994.[18] In addition, by 2021, Stanford students and alumni had won at least 296 Olympic medals including 150 gold and 79 silver medals.[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n78. **^** Merl, Jean (July 30, 1991). \"Stanford President, Beset by Controversies, Will Quit: Education: Donald Kennedy to step down next year.

The original 24 trustees were appointed for life in 1885 by the Stanfords as were some of the subsequent replacements. In 1899 Jane Stanford changed the maximum number of trustees from 24 to 15 and set the term of office to 10 years. On June 1, 1903, she resigned her powers as founder and the board took on its full powers. In the 1950s, the board decided that its fifteen members were not sufficient to do all the work needed and in March 1954 petitioned the courts to raise the maximum number to 23, of whom 20 would be regular trustees serving 10-year terms and 3 would be alumni trustees serving 5-year terms. In 1970 another petition was successfully made to have the number raised to a maximum of 35 (with a minimum of 25), that all trustees would be regular trustees, and that the university president would be a trustee *ex officio*.[113] The last original trustee, Timothy Hopkins, died in 1936; the last life trustee, Joseph D. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Associated Students of Stanford University (ASSU) is the student government for Stanford and all registered students are members.

Jane and Leland Stanford modeled their university after the great Eastern universities, specifically Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. Stanford was referred to as the \"Cornell of the West\" in 1891 due to a majority of its faculty being former Cornell affiliates, including its first president, David Starr Jordan, and second president, John Casper Branner. Both Cornell and Stanford were among the first to make higher education accessible, non-sectarian, and open to women as well as men. Cornell is credited as one of the first American universities to adopt that radical departure from traditional education, and Stanford became an early adopter as well.[52]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n113. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Stanford University – The Founding Grant with Amendments, Legislation, and Court Decrees\" (PDF).

The Hoover Institution Library and Archives is a research center based on history of twentieth century.[159] Stanford University Libraries (SUL) held a collection of more than 9.3 million volumes, nearly 300,000 rare or special books, 1.5 million e-books, 2.5 million audiovisual materials, 77,000 serials, nearly 6 million microform holdings, thousands of other digital resources.[160] and 516,620 journal, 526,414 images, 11,000 software collection, 1,00,000 videos etc. .[161]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs of 2016, Stanford had thirty-one Greek organizations, including fourteen sororities and sixteen fraternities. Nine of the Greek organizations were housed (eight in University-owned houses and one, Sigma Chi, in their own house, although the land is owned by the university).[287] Five chapters were members of the African American Fraternal and Sororal Association, eleven chapters were members of the Interfraternity Council, seven chapters belonged to the Intersorority Council, and six chapters belonged to the Multicultural Greek Council.[288]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nStanford University was founded in 1885 by Leland Stanford—a railroad magnate who served as the eighth governor of and then-incumbent senator from California—and his wife, Jane, in memory of their only child, Leland Stanford Jr., who had died of typhoid fever aged 15 the previous year.[2] The university admitted its first students on October 1, 1891,[2][3] as a coeducational and non-denominational institution. Stanford University struggled financially after Leland's death in 1893 and again after much of the campus was damaged by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.[15] Following World War II, Frederick Terman, the university's provost, inspired and supported faculty and graduates entrepreneurialism to build a self-sufficient local industry, which would later be known as Silicon Valley.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nStanford is home to the Martin Luther King Jr. Research and Education Institute which grew out of and still contains the Martin Luther King Jr. Papers Project, a collaboration with the King Center to publish the King papers held by the King Center.[156] It also runs the John S. Knight Fellowship for Professional Journalists and the Center for Ocean Solutions, which brings together marine science and policy to address challenges facing the ocean. It focuses mainly five points, such as climate change, overfishing, coastal development, pollution, and plastics.[157]\n\n\nTogether with UC Berkeley and UC San Francisco, Stanford is part of the Biohub, a new medical science research center founded in 2016 by a $600 million commitment from Facebook CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg and pediatrician Priscilla Chan. This medical research center is working for designing advanced-level health care units.[158]\n\n\n\n### Libraries and digital resources[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Green Library\nMain article: Stanford University Libraries\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Students on an urban hike organized by the Graduate Student Programming Board (GSPB)\nAs of 2020, Stanford had more than 600 student organizations.[293] Groups are often, though not always, partially funded by the university via allocations directed by the student government organization, the ASSU. These funds include \"special fees,\" which are decided by a Spring Quarter vote by the student body. Groups span athletics and recreation, careers/pre-professional, community service, ethnic/cultural, fraternities and sororities, health and counseling, media and publications, the arts, political and social awareness, and religious and philosophical organizations. In contrast to many other selective universities, Stanford policy mandates that all recognized student clubs be \"broadly open\" for all interested students to join.[294][295][296][297]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n93. **^** \"Faculty-in-Residence : Bing Overseas Study Program\". *bosp.stanford.edu*.

In 1944, University President Donald Tresidder banned all Stanford sororities due to extreme competition.[284] However, following Title IX, the Board of Trustees lifted the 33-year ban on sororities in 1977.[285] Students are not permitted to join a fraternity or sorority until spring quarter of their freshman year.[286]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe central campus includes a seasonal lake (Lake Lagunita, actually an irrigation reservoir), home to the vulnerable California tiger salamander. As of 2012, Lake Lagunita was often dry and the university had no plans to artificially fill it.[85] Heavy rains in January 2023 refilled Lake Lagunita (colloquially known as Lake Lag) to up to 8 feet of depth.[86] Two other reservoirs, Searsville Lake on San Francisquito Creek and Felt Lake,[87] are on more remote sections of the founding grant.\n\n\n\n### Central campus[edit]\n\n\nThe central academic campus is adjacent to Palo Alto,[88] bounded by El Camino Real, Stanford Avenue, Junipero Serra Blvd, and Sand Hill Road. The United States Postal Service has assigned it two ZIP Codes: 94305 for campus mail and 94309 for P.O. box mail.

The winner of the annual \"Big Game\" between the Cal and Cardinal football teams gains custody of the Stanford Axe.[251] As of May 9, 2022, Stanford has won 130 NCAA team championships, more than any other school. Stanford has won at least one NCAA team championship each academic year for 46 consecutive years, starting in 1976–77 and continuing through 2021–22.[252] The second-longest NCAA championship streak was nineteen years, achieved by USC from 1959 to 1960 through 1977–78. As of January 1, 2022, Stanford athletes have won 529 NCAA individual championships. No other Division I school is within 100 of Stanford's total.[253] Stanford won 25 consecutive NACDA Directors' Cups, from 1994 to 1995 through 2018–19, awarded annually to the most successful overall college sports program in the nation.[252]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n293. **^** \"Campus Communities & Service Opportunities: Student Organizations\".

It is awarded not at prescribed intervals, but instead only when the president of the university deems it appropriate to recognize extraordinary service. Recipients include Herbert Hoover, Bill Hewlett, Dave Packard, Lucile Packard, and John Gardner.[277]\n* Former campus traditions include the Big Game bonfire on Lake Lagunita (a seasonal lake usually dry in the fall), which was formally ended in 1997 because of the presence of endangered salamanders in the lake bed.[278]\n\n\n### Religious life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Official website ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n* Stanford Athletics website\n* ![](image) Texts on Wikisource:\n\t+ \"Leland Stanford Jr. University\". *Encyclopædia Britannica* (11th ed.). 1911.\n\t+ \"Leland Stanford Junior University\". *Encyclopedia Americana*. 1920.\n\t+ \"Leland Stanford, Junior, University\". *Collier's New Encyclopedia*. 1921.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Eleven historically National Interfraternity Conference (NIC) fraternities are also represented at Stanford, including five unhoused fraternities (Alpha Epsilon Pi, Delta Kappa Epsilon, Delta Tau Delta, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, and Kappa Alpha Order), and four housed fraternities (Sigma Phi Epsilon, Kappa Sigma, Phi Kappa Psi, and Sigma Nu).

This decline prompted *The Daily Princetonian* to write a series of articles on the decline and its reasons. *The New York Observer* wrote that Princeton was \"long dogged by a reputation for anti-Semitism\" and that this history as well as Princeton's elite status caused the university and its community to feel sensitivity towards the decrease of Jewish students. In the *Observer*, several theories are proposed for the drop, ranging from campus culture to changing admission policies to national patterns.[380] As of 2021, according to the Center for Jewish Life on campus, the university has approximately 700 Jewish students.[381]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPrinceton uses a residential college system and is known for its upperclassmen eating clubs.

The campuses are situated about one hour from both New York City and Philadelphia on the train.[151] The university also owns more than 520 acres (2.1 km2) of property in West Windsor Township,[4] and is where Princeton is planning to construct a graduate student housing complex, which will be known as \"Lake Campus North\".[152]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1. **^**  Princeton is the fourth institution of higher learning to obtain a collegiate charter, conduct classes, or grant degrees, based upon dates that do not seem to be in dispute. Princeton and the University of Pennsylvania both claim the fourth oldest founding date and the University of Pennsylvania once claimed 1749 as its founding date, making it fifth oldest, but in 1899 its trustees adopted a resolution which asserted 1740 as the founding date.[10][11] To further complicate the comparison of founding dates, a Log College was operated by William and Gilbert Tennent, the Presbyterian ministers, in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, from 1726 until 1746 and it was once common to assert a formal connection between it and the College of New Jersey, which would justify Princeton pushing its founding date back to 1726. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Department of Energy's Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) stemmed from Project Matterhorn, a top secret cold war project created in 1951 aimed at achieving controlled nuclear fusion.[284] Princeton astrophysics professor Lyman Spitzer became the first director of the project and remained director until the lab's declassification in 1961 when it received its current name.[284] Today, it is an institute for fusion energy research and plasma physics research.[285]\n\n\nFounded in 1955 and located at Princeton's Forrestal Campus since 1968, the NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) conducts climate research and modeling.[286][287] Princeton faculty, research scientists, and graduate scientists can participate in research with the lab.[286]\n\n\n\n## Admissions and financial aid[edit]\n\n\n### Admissions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Undergraduate admissions statistics |\n| --- |\n| 2022 enteringclass[288]Change vs.2017[289]\n\n\n---\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![A picture of Firestone Library](image)Firestone Library, the largest of Princeton's librariesThe Princeton University Library system houses over 13 million holdings through 11 buildings,[279] including seven million bound volumes, making it one of the largest university libraries in the country.[14] Built in 1948, the main campus library is Firestone Library and serves as the main repository for the humanities and social sciences.[279] Its collections include the autographed manuscript of F. Scott Fitzgerald's *The Great Gatsby*[280] and George F. Kennan's Long Telegram.[281] In addition to Firestone library, specialized libraries exist for architecture, art and archaeology, East Asian studies, engineering, music, public and international affairs, public policy and university archives, and the sciences.[282] The library system provides access to subscription-based electronic resources and databases to students.[283]\n\n\n#### National laboratories[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nin their field of interest.[77] The changes brought about many new faculty and cemented Princeton's academics for the first half of the 20th century.[78] Due to the tightening of academic standards, enrollment declined severely until 1907.[75] In 1906, the reservoir Lake Carnegie was created by Andrew Carnegie,[79] and the university officially became nonsectarian.[80] Before leaving office, Wilson strengthened the science program to focus on \"pure\" research and broke the Presbyterian lock on the board of trustees.[73][81] However, he did fail in winning support for the permanent location of the Graduate School and the elimination of the eating clubs, which he proposed replacing with quadrangles, a precursor to the residential college system.[82] Wilson also continued to keep Princeton closed off from accepting Black students.[83] When an aspiring Black student wrote a letter to Wilson, he got his secretary to reply telling him to attend a university where he would be more welcome.[84]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of Princeton University people and List of Nobel laureates affiliated with Princeton University as alumni or faculty.\n\n### Alumni[edit]\n\n\nMain category: Princeton University alumni\n\nU.S. Presidents James Madison and Woodrow Wilson and Vice Presidents George M.

This decline prompted *The Daily Princetonian* to write a series of articles on the decline and its reasons. *The New York Observer* wrote that Princeton was \"long dogged by a reputation for anti-Semitism\" and that this history as well as Princeton's elite status caused the university and its community to feel sensitivity towards the decrease of Jewish students. In the *Observer*, several theories are proposed for the drop, ranging from campus culture to changing admission policies to national patterns.[380] As of 2021, according to the Center for Jewish Life on campus, the university has approximately 700 Jewish students.[381]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPrinceton uses a residential college system and is known for its upperclassmen eating clubs.

The campuses are situated about one hour from both New York City and Philadelphia on the train.[151] The university also owns more than 520 acres (2.1 km2) of property in West Windsor Township,[4] and is where Princeton is planning to construct a graduate student housing complex, which will be known as \"Lake Campus North\".[152]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1. **^**  Princeton is the fourth institution of higher learning to obtain a collegiate charter, conduct classes, or grant degrees, based upon dates that do not seem to be in dispute. Princeton and the University of Pennsylvania both claim the fourth oldest founding date and the University of Pennsylvania once claimed 1749 as its founding date, making it fifth oldest, but in 1899 its trustees adopted a resolution which asserted 1740 as the founding date.[10][11] To further complicate the comparison of founding dates, a Log College was operated by William and Gilbert Tennent, the Presbyterian ministers, in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, from 1726 until 1746 and it was once common to assert a formal connection between it and the College of New Jersey, which would justify Princeton pushing its founding date back to 1726. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Department of Energy's Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) stemmed from Project Matterhorn, a top secret cold war project created in 1951 aimed at achieving controlled nuclear fusion.[284] Princeton astrophysics professor Lyman Spitzer became the first director of the project and remained director until the lab's declassification in 1961 when it received its current name.[284] Today, it is an institute for fusion energy research and plasma physics research.[285]\n\n\nFounded in 1955 and located at Princeton's Forrestal Campus since 1968, the NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) conducts climate research and modeling.[286][287] Princeton faculty, research scientists, and graduate scientists can participate in research with the lab.[286]\n\n\n\n## Admissions and financial aid[edit]\n\n\n### Admissions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Undergraduate admissions statistics |\n| --- |\n| 2022 enteringclass[288]Change vs.2017[289]\n\n\n---\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![A picture of Firestone Library](image)Firestone Library, the largest of Princeton's librariesThe Princeton University Library system houses over 13 million holdings through 11 buildings,[279] including seven million bound volumes, making it one of the largest university libraries in the country.[14] Built in 1948, the main campus library is Firestone Library and serves as the main repository for the humanities and social sciences.[279] Its collections include the autographed manuscript of F.

IBM will spend $240 million over the next decade, and the lab will be staffed by MIT and IBM scientists.[103] In October 2018 MIT announced that it would open a new Schwarzman College of Computing dedicated to the study of artificial intelligence, named after lead donor and The Blackstone Group CEO Stephen Schwarzman. The focus of the new college is to study not just AI, but interdisciplinary AI education, and how AI can be used in fields as diverse as history and biology.

Established in 1861, MIT has played a significant role in the development of many areas of modern technology and science.\n\n\nFounded in response to the increasing industrialization of the United States, MIT adopted a European polytechnic university model and stressed laboratory instruction in applied science and engineering. MIT is one of three private land grant universities in the United States, the others being Cornell University and Tuskegee University. The institute has an urban campus that extends more than a mile (1.6 km) alongside the Charles River, and encompasses a number of major off-campus facilities such as the MIT Lincoln Laboratory, the Bates Center, and the Haystack Observatory, as well as affiliated laboratories such as the Broad and Whitehead Institutes.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n80. **^** \"About W3C: History\".

Richards also became the first female member of MIT's faculty, specializing in sanitary chemistry.[389][390] Female students remained a small minority prior to the completion of the first wing of a women's dormitory, McCormick Hall, in 1963.[391][392][393] Between 1993 and 2009 the proportion of women rose from 34 percent to 45 percent of undergraduates and from 20 percent to 31 percent of graduate students.[184][394] As of 2009[update], women outnumbered men in Biology, Brain & Cognitive Sciences, Architecture, Urban Planning, and Biological Engineering.[184][395]\n\n\n\n### Faculty and staff[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty and List of Nobel laureates affiliated with Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMIT has substantial commercial real estate holdings in Cambridge on which it pays property taxes, plus an additional voluntary payment in lieu of taxes (PILOT) on academic buildings which are legally tax-exempt.

Established in 1861, MIT has played a significant role in the development of many areas of modern technology and science.\n\n\nFounded in response to the increasing industrialization of the United States, MIT adopted a European polytechnic university model and stressed laboratory instruction in applied science and engineering. MIT is one of three private land grant universities in the United States, the others being Cornell University and Tuskegee University. The institute has an urban campus that extends more than a mile (1.6 km) alongside the Charles River, and encompasses a number of major off-campus facilities such as the MIT Lincoln Laboratory, the Bates Center, and the Haystack Observatory, as well as affiliated laboratories such as the Broad and Whitehead Institutes.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n80. **^** \"About W3C: History\".

Lavoisier, for example, is placed in the company of Boyle, Cavendish, Priestley, Dalton, Gay Lussac, Berzelius, Woehler, Liebig, Bunsen, Mendelejeff [*sic*], Perkin, and van't Hoff.[135][136]\n2. **^** The Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology (HST) offers joint MD, MD-PhD, or Medical Engineering degrees in collaboration with Harvard Medical School.[165]\n3. **^** Course numbers are sometimes presented in Roman numerals, e.g. \"Course XVIII\" for mathematics.[184] At least one MIT style guide now discourages this usage.[185] Also, some Course numbers have been re-assigned over time, so that the subject area of a degree may depend on the year it was awarded.[182]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ![Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin, ScD 1963 (MIT Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics)](image)\n\nApollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin, ScD 1963 (MIT Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics)\n* ![Former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, SM 1972 (MIT Sloan School of Management)](image)\n\nFormer UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, SM 1972 (MIT Sloan School of Management)\n* ![President of Colombia (1986–1990) Virgilio Barco Vargas, SB 1943 (MIT Civil and Environmental Engineering)](image)\n\nPresident of Colombia (1986–1990) Virgilio Barco Vargas, SB 1943 (MIT Civil and Environmental Engineering)\n* ![Former Federal Reserve Bank chairman and 2022 Nobel Laureate Ben Bernanke, PhD 1979 (MIT Department of Economics)](image)\n\nFormer Federal Reserve Bank chairman and 2022 Nobel Laureate Ben Bernanke, PhD 1979 (MIT Department of Economics)\n* ![Economics Nobel laureate Esther Duflo, PhD 1999 (MIT Department of Economics), also an MIT professor[418]](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 2001, inspired by the open source and open access movements,[89] MIT launched OpenCourseWare to make the lecture notes, problem sets, syllabi, exams, and lectures from the great majority of its courses available online for no charge, though without any formal accreditation for coursework completed.[90] While the cost of supporting and hosting the project is high,[91] OCW expanded in 2005 to include other universities as a part of the OpenCourseWare Consortium, which currently includes more than 250 academic institutions with content available in at least six languages.[92] In 2011, MIT announced it would offer formal certification (but not credits or degrees) to online participants completing coursework in its \"MITx\" program, for a modest fee.[93] The \"edX\" online platform supporting MITx was initially developed in partnership with Harvard and its analogous \"Harvardx\" initiative. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n357. **^** Wang, Hanhan (2005-04-12). \"Caltech Pranks CPW; MIT Hackers Reply\" (PDF). *The Tech*. p. 1.

Pei's Green, Dreyfus, Landau, and Wiesner buildings represent high forms of post-war modernist architecture.[137][138][139] More recent buildings like Frank Gehry's Stata Center (2004), Steven Holl's Simmons Hall (2002), Charles Correa's Building 46 (2005), and Fumihiko Maki's Media Lab Extension (2009) stand out among the Boston area's classical architecture and serve as examples of contemporary campus \"starchitecture\".[132][140] These buildings have not always been well received;[141][142] in 2010, *The Princeton Review* included MIT in a list of twenty schools whose campuses are \"tiny, unsightly, or both\".[143]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMIT Nano, also known as Building 12, is an interdisciplinary facility for nanoscale research. Its 100,000 sq ft (9,300 m2) cleanroom and research space, visible through expansive glass facades, is the largest research facility of its kind in the nation.[120] With a cost of US$400 million, it is also one of the costliest buildings on campus. The facility also provides state-of-the-art nanoimaging capabilities with vibration damped imaging and metrology suites sitting atop a 5×10~~^~~6 lb (2,300,000 kg) slab of concrete underground.[121]\n\n\nOther notable campus facilities include a pressurized wind tunnel for testing aerodynamic research, a towing tank for testing ship and ocean structure designs, and previously Alcator C-Mod, which was the largest fusion device operated by any university.[122][123] MIT's campus-wide wireless network was completed in the fall of 2005 and consists of nearly 3,000 access points covering 9.4×10~~^~~6 sq ft (870,000 m2) of campus.[124]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2013–2014, MIT abruptly closed and then demolished undergrad dorm Bexley Hall, citing extensive water damage that made repairs infeasible. In 2017, MIT shut down Senior House after a century of service as an undergrad dorm. That year, MIT administrators released data showing just 60% of Senior House residents had graduated in four years. Campus-wide, the four-year graduation rate is 84% (the cumulative graduation rate is significantly higher).[153]\n\n\n\n## Organization and administration[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nColleges and universities in metropolitan Boston\n |\n| --- |\n| * Babson College\n* Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology\n* Bentley University\n* Berklee College of Music\n* Boston Architectural College\n* Boston Baptist College\n* Boston College\n* Boston Conservatory\n* Boston Graduate School of Psychoanalysis\n* Boston University\n* Brandeis University\n* Bunker Hill Community College\n* Cambridge College\n* Curry College\n* Eastern Nazarene College\n* Emerson College\n* Emmanuel College\n* Fisher College\n* Harvard University\n* Hebrew College\n* Hellenic College\n* Hult International Business School\n* Labouré College\n* Lasell University\n* Lesley University\n* Longy School of Music\n* Massachusetts Bay Community College\n* Massachusetts College of Art and Design\n* Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences\n* Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n* MGH Institute\n* New England College of Optometry\n* New England Conservatory of Music\n* New England School of Law\n* Northeastern University\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n389. **^** Bowden, Mary Ellen (1997). *Chemical achievers: the human face of the chemical sciences*.
