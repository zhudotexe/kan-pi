Dubbed the \"biggest girl group in the world\", they are renowned as the most successful Korean girl group internationally and one of the leaders of the Korean Wave. They are stylistically associated with the \"girl crush\" concept in K-pop\u2014exploring themes of self-confidence and female empowerment.\n\n\nBlackpink debuted in August 2016 with their single album *Square One*, which featured \"Whistle\" and \"Boombayah\", their first number-one entries on South Korea's Gaon Digital Chart and the US *Billboard* World Digital Songs chart, respectively. It was followed by the single album *Square Two* in November, whose song \"Playing with Fire\" was the first by a Korean girl group to enter the *Billboard* Canadian Hot 100.

According to the members, joining the label as trainees was akin to enrolling in a full-time pop-star academy, with Jennie describing the experience as \"more strict than school\" and Ros\u00e9 comparing it to *The X Factor* with dorm rooms. For members who had left their lives outside of South Korea, the pace of training alongside the culture shock was especially difficult.[2] Preparations for Blackpink's debut began as early as 2011, when YG Entertainment revealed on November 14 that their new girl group would debut in the early half of 2012 and feature at least seven members.[3] Since then, numerous news and rumors surfaced surrounding the new girl group's debut being delayed, although there had been no official information.[4][5] It was only on May 18, 2016, that YG Entertainment confirmed the girl group would debut that July, stating that the members were selected through years of stiff competition.[6] The label later confirmed that Jang Hanna and Moon Sua, who were introduced to the public as potential members of the new girl group, were not included in the lineup.[7][8]\n\n\nJennie was the first group member revealed, on June 1, 2016.[9] She joined YG Entertainment as a trainee in 2010 after moving back to South Korea from New Zealand.[10] She had been introduced to the public for the first time in 2012 in a photo titled \"Who's that girl?\" on YG Entertainment's website on April 10.[11] Jennie continued to be promoted as a member of the new girl group through multiple collaborations: she starred in the music video for G-Dragon's \"That XX\" (2012) from his EP *One of a Kind* and featured in the songs \"Black\" (2013), from his album *Coup d'Etat*, and \"Special\" (2013), from Lee Hi's album *First Love*.[12][13][14] Lisa was revealed as the new girl group's second member on June 8, 2016.[15] She was the only individual among 4,000 applicants to pass the 2010 YG Entertainment audition in her native country Thailand and became the label's first foreign trainee in 2011.[10][16] She was first introduced in May 2012 in a video that was posted on YG Entertainment's YouTube channel, titled \"Who's that girl???\".[15][17] Lisa also appeared in the music video for Taeyang's \"Ringa Linga\" in 2013.[18] She became a spokesperson for street-wear brand Nona9on in 2015 and cosmetics brand Moonshot in 2016.[19]\n\n\nJisoo was revealed as the new group's third member on June 15, 2016.
