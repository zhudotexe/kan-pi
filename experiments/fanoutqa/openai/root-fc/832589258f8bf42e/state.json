For the production background of the films, see Production of the *James Bond* films. For the various portrayals of the character, see Portrayal of James Bond in film.\n\n\nJames Bond is a fictional character created by British novelist Ian Fleming in 1953. A British secret agent working for MI6 under the codename 007, Bond has been portrayed on film in twenty-seven productions by actors Sean Connery, David Niven, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig. Eon Productions, which now holds the adaptation rights to all of Fleming's Bond novels, made all but two films in the film series.[1][2]\n\n\nIn 1961, producers Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman purchased the filming rights to Fleming's novels.[3] They founded Eon Productions and, with financial backing by United Artists, produced *Dr. No*, directed by Terence Young and featuring Connery as Bond.[4] Following its release in 1962, Broccoli and Saltzman created the holding company Danjaq to ensure future productions in the *James Bond* film series.[5] The Eon series currently has twenty-five films, with the most recent, *No Time to Die*, released in September 2021. With a combined gross of $7.8\u00a0billion to date, it is the fifth-highest-grossing film series in nominal terms.[6] Adjusting for inflation, the series has earned over $19.2\u00a0billion in 2022 dollars from box-office receipts alone,[a] with non-Eon entries pushing this inflation-adjusted figure to a grand total in excess of $20\u00a0billion.\n\n\nThe films have won six Academy Awards: for Sound Effects (now Sound Editing) in *Goldfinger* (at the 37th Awards), to John Stears for Visual Effects in *Thunderball* (at the 38th Awards), to Per Hallberg and Karen Baker Landers for Sound Editing, to Adele and Paul Epworth for Original Song in *Skyfall* (at the 85th Awards), to Sam Smith and Jimmy Napes for Original Song in *Spectre* (at the 88th Awards), and to Billie Eilish and Finneas O'Connell for Original Song in *No Time to Die* (at the 94th Awards). Several other songs produced for the films have been nominated for Academy Awards for Original Song, including Paul McCartney's \"Live and Let Die\", Carly Simon's \"Nobody Does It Better\", and Sheena Easton's \"For Your Eyes Only\". In 1982, Albert R. Broccoli received the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award.[7]\n\n\nWhen Broccoli and Saltzman bought the rights to existing and future Fleming titles, the deal did not include *Casino Royale*, which had been sold to producer Gregory Ratoff for a television adaptation in 1954. After Ratoff's death, the rights passed to Charles K. Feldman,[8] who subsequently produced the Bond spoof *Casino Royale* in 1967.[9] A legal case ensured that the film rights to the novel *Thunderball* were held by Kevin McClory, as he, Fleming and scriptwriter Jack Whittingham had written a film script on which the novel was based.[1] Although Eon Productions and McClory joined forces to produce *Thunderball*, McClory still retained the rights to the story and adapted *Thunderball* into 1983's non-Eon entry, *Never Say Never Again*.[10] Distribution rights to both of those films are currently held by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures, which distributes Eon's regular series.[11][12]\n\n\n\n\n## Eon films[edit]\n\n\n\n\nList of Eon films\n| Title\n | Year\n | Bond actor\n | Director\n | Box office (millions)[13] | Budget (millions)[13] | Ref(s) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Actual $\n | Adjusted $2005\n | Actual $\n | Adjusted $2005\n |\n| *Dr. No* | 1962\n | Sean Connery | Terence Young | 59.5\n | 448.8\n | 1.1\n | 7.0\n | [13][14] |\n| *From Russia with Love* | 1963\n | Sean Connery | Terence Young | 78.9\n | 543.8\n | 2.0\n | 12.6\n | [13][14][15] |\n| *Goldfinger* | 1964\n | Sean Connery | Guy Hamilton | 124.9\n | 820.4\n | 3.0\n | 18.6\n | [13][14][16] |\n| *Thunderball* | 1965\n | Sean Connery | Terence Young | 141.2\n | 848.1\n | 6.8\n | 41.9\n | [13][14][17] |\n| *You Only Live Twice* | 1967\n | Sean Connery | Lewis Gilbert | 111.6\n | 514.2\n | 10.3\n | 59.9\n | [14][18] |\n| *On Her Majesty's Secret Service* | 1969\n | George Lazenby | Peter R.

Gareth Mallory takes Bond off active duty for his illegal operation, but Bond continues his investigation off the books. The trail leads him first to Rome, where he learns of a sinister terrorist organisation known as Spectre, and later to Austria. There he finds former adversary Mr. White, who has become terminally ill after being poisoned by Spectre. White asks Bond to protect his daughter Madeleine Swann from Spectre and its leader, Franz Oberhauser, before committing suicide.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Mallory comes under pressure to have British intelligence join a global intelligence-sharing network code-named \"Nine Eyes\". With Swann's help, Bond tracks Spectre to Morocco and learns that Spectre is behind the terror attacks, creating a need for Nine Eyes. Spectre controls Nine Eyes, giving them access to the intelligence-sharing network. Oberhauser captures and tortures Bond, revealing that his father was Bond's guardian after the deaths of Bond's parents. Jealous of the attention and care that his father gave to the young James Bond, Oberhauser faked his own death while at the same time murdering his own father. Now known as Ernst Stavro Blofeld, he claims responsibility for everything Bond has suffered in his career. Bond and Swann escape and return to London where Bond joins forces with Mallory and Q to shut down Nine Eyes and apprehend Blofeld.[47][48][49]\n\n\n\n### *No Time to Die* (2021)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *No Time to Die*\n\nFive years after Blofeld's imprisonment, Bond is retired and living in Jamaica when Felix Leiter and his colleague Logan Ash enlist his help in searching for the missing MI6 scientist, Valdo Obruchev. Bond eventually accepts Leiter's request and follows his leads about the scientist's whereabouts to Cuba, where he infiltrates a Spectre gathering. Obruchev realises that it is a trap set by Blofeld to kill Bond with a deadly virus, but he is working for someone else and has re-engineered the virus to attack only the members of Spectre. When Bond brings Obruchev to Leiter, Ash betrays them and helps Obruchev escape, killing Leiter. Bond returns to MI6 and confronts M regarding the virus, known as \"Heracles,\" a nanoscale weapon that can be programmed to attack specific people based on their genetic marker. He then visits Blofeld in prison and is reacquainted with Madeleine Swann. Swann decides to leave before Blofeld arrives, while Bond has an altercation with Blofeld, who dies soon after. It is revealed that when he touched Swann, Bond was infected with Heracles nanobots that were programmed to kill Blofeld.\n\n\nBond traces Swann back to her childhood home where she is living with her five-year-old daughter, Mathilde. She tells Bond about Lyutsifer Safin, the man who controls Heracles. After Bond avenges Leiter's death by killing Ash, Safin captures Swann and Mathilde and brings them to his island, which is the Heracles factory. Bond works with MI6 to rescue Swann and Mathilde and destroy Safin's factory with a missile strike launched from a nearby Royal Navy destroyer. Before Bond kills him, Safin infects Bond with nanobots that have been programmed to attack Swann and Mathilde. Because of this, Bond decides to sacrifice himself to save them. After a tearful goodbye to Swann, who confirms that Mathilde is in fact his daughter, Bond is killed when the missiles obliterate the factory.[50][51]\n\n\n\n## Non-Eon films[edit]\n\n\nThe two Bond films from other production companies have a combined gross of over $200\u00a0million (or approximately $871 million in 2020 dollars)\n\n\n\n\n\nList of non-Eon films\n| Title\n | Year\n | Bond actor\n | Director(s)\n | Box office (millions)[13] | Budget (millions)[13] | Ref(s) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Actual $\n | Adjusted $2005\n | Actual $\n | Adjusted $2005\n |\n| *Casino Royale* | 1967 | David Niven | Ken HughesJohn HustonJoseph McGrathRobert ParrishVal GuestRichard Talmadge | 44.4\n | 260.0\n | 12.0\n | 70.0\n | [52][53][34] |\n| *Never Say Never Again* | 1983\n | Sean Connery | Irvin Kershner | 160.0\n | 314.0\n | 36.0\n | 71.0\n | [54][34] |\n| Total of non-Eon films\n | 204.4\n | 574.0\n | 48.0\n | 141.0\n |  |\n\n\n### *Casino Royale* (1967)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)David Niven, in *Casino Royale*\nMain article: *Casino Royale* (1967 film)\n\nBond is brought out of retirement to deal with SMERSH and is promoted to the head of MI6 on the death of M.

It was produced by Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, and directed by Lee Tamahori. The fourth and final film starring Pierce Brosnan as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond, it was also the only film to feature John Cleese as Q, and the last with Samantha Bond as Miss Moneypenny. It is also the first film since *Live and Let Die* (1973) not to feature Desmond Llewelyn as Q as he died three years earlier. Halle Berry co-stars as NSA agent Giacinta \"Jinx\" Johnson, the Bond girl. It follows Bond as he attempts to locate a mole in British intelligence who betrayed him and a British billionaire who is later revealed to be connected to a North Korean operative whom Bond seemingly killed. It is an original story, although it takes influence from Bond creator Ian Fleming's novels *Moonraker* (1955) and *The Man with the Golden Gun* (1965), as well as Kingsley Amis's novel, *Colonel Sun*.[3]\n\n\n*Die Another Day* marked the *James Bond* franchise's 40th anniversary. The film includes references to each of the preceding films.[4] It received mixed reviews; some critics praised Tamahori's direction, but others criticized its reliance on CGI, product placement and its unoriginal plot, as well as the villain. Nevertheless, it was the highest-grossing *James Bond* film up to that time.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nMI6 agent James Bond infiltrates a North Korean military base where Colonel Tan-Sun Moon is trading weapons for African conflict diamonds. After Moon's right-hand man Zao receives notification of Bond's real identity, Moon attempts to kill Bond and a hovercraft chase ensues, ending with Moon's craft tumbling over a waterfall. Bond is captured by North Korean soldiers and imprisoned by the Colonel's father, General Moon. After fourteen months of captivity and torture at the hands of the Korean People's Army, Bond is traded for Zao in a prisoner exchange across the Bridge of No Return. He is sedated and taken to meet M, who informs him that his status as a 00 Agent has been suspended under suspicion of having leaked information under duress to the North Koreans. Bond is convinced that he has been set up by a double agent in the British government. After escaping MI6 custody, he finds himself in Hong Kong, where he learns from Chang, a Chinese agent and old colleague, that Zao is in Cuba.\n\n\nIn Havana, Bond meets with NSA agent Giacinta \"Jinx\" Johnson, and follows her to a gene therapy clinic, where patients can have their appearances altered through DNA restructuring. Jinx kills Dr. Alvarez, the leader of the therapy, while Bond locates Zao inside the clinic and fights him. Zao escapes, leaving behind a pendant which leads Bond to a cache of conflict diamonds bearing the crest of the company owned by British billionaire Gustav Graves. Bond learns that Graves only appeared a year prior, apparently discovering a vein of diamonds in Iceland leading to his current wealth and celebrity. At Blades Club in London, Bond meets Graves along with his assistant Miranda Frost, who is also an undercover MI6 agent. After a fencing match that escalates into a claymore duel, Graves invites Bond to Iceland for a scientific demonstration. M restores Bond's Double-0 status, and Q issues him an Aston Martin V12 Vanquish with active camouflage.\n\n\n\n![](image)Aston Martin V12 Vanquish and Bombardier MX Rev Ski-Doo used in the film\nAt his ice palace in Iceland, Graves unveils a new orbital mirror satellite, \"Icarus\", which is able to focus solar energy on a small area and provide year-round sunshine for agriculture. Bond seduces Frost and Jinx infiltrates Graves' command centre, but is captured by Graves and Zao. Bond rescues her and discovers that Graves is Colonel Moon, who has used the gene therapy technology to change his appearance and amassed his fortune from conflict diamonds as a cover. Bond confronts Graves, but Frost arrives to reveal herself as the traitor who betrayed him in North Korea, forcing Bond to escape from Graves' facility. He returns in his Vanquish to rescue Jinx, who has been recaptured in the palace. As Graves uses Icarus to melt the ice palace, Zao pursues Bond into the palace using his Jaguar XKR. Bond kills Zao by causing a giant ice chandelier to fall onto him, and revives Jinx after she has almost drowned.\n\n\nBond and Jinx pursue Graves and Frost to the Korean peninsula and stow away on Graves' An-124 cargo plane. Graves reveals his identity to his father, and the true purpose of the Icarus satellite: to cut a path through the Korean Demilitarized Zone with concentrated sunlight, allowing North Korean troops to invade South Korea and unite the peninsula. Horrified, General Moon rejects the plan, but Graves murders him. Bond attempts to shoot Graves, but is prevented by a soldier. In their struggle, a gunshot pierces the fuselage, causing the plane to decompress and descend rapidly. Bond and Graves engage in a fistfight, and Jinx attempts to regain control of the plane. Frost attacks Jinx, forcing her to defend herself in a sword duel. After the plane passes through the Icarus beam and is further damaged, Jinx kills Frost. Graves attempts to escape by parachute, but Bond opens the parachute, pulling Graves out of the plane and into one of its engines, disabling the Icarus beam. Bond and Jinx escape from the disintegrating plane in a helicopter from the cargo hold, with Graves' stash of diamonds. Later, they spend a romantic evening at a Buddhist temple.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n* Pierce Brosnan as James Bond, an MI6 agent.\n* Halle Berry as Giacinta \"Jinx\" Johnson, an NSA agent.[5][6] Before Berry's casting Salma Hayek, Saffron Burrows, and Sophie Ellis-Bextor were also considered for the role.[3]\n* Toby Stephens as Gustav Graves, a British entrepreneur and the alter ego of Colonel Tan-Sun Moon. Graves was modelled after Hugo Drax in Ian Fleming's original *Moonraker*, a Nazi war criminal who switched places with a British soldier at the end of World War II, became a well-respected and wealthy philanthropist, and used this cover to plan a nuclear missile strike on London. He was also modelled after Uday Hussein and Richard Branson.[3]\n* Will Yun Lee as Colonel Tan-Sun Moon, a rogue North Korean army colonel and the original persona of Graves.\n* Rosamund Pike as Miranda Frost, undercover MI6 agent and double agent.\n* Rick Yune as Tang Ling Zao, a North Korean terrorist working for Moon and living as an exile.\n* Judi Dench as M, the head of MI6.\n* John Cleese as Q, MI6's quartermaster and armourer.\n* Madonna as Verity, Graves and Frost's fencing instructor.\n* Michael Madsen as Damian Falco, Jinx's superior in the NSA.\n* Samantha Bond as Miss Moneypenny, M's secretary.\n* Colin Salmon as Charles Robinson, M's Deputy Chief of Staff.\n* Kenneth Tsang as General Moon, Colonel Moon's father. He assists in Bond's release back to the West. The North Korean general wishes for a peaceful reunification of Korea, whereas his son is bent on war.\n* Michael Gorevoy as Vladimir Popov, Gustav Graves' personal scientist.\n* Lawrence Makoare as Mr. Kil, one of Gustav Graves' henchmen.\n* Ho Yi as The Hotel Manager and Chinese special agent Mr. Chang. In early drafts of the script, it was Wai Lin (Michelle Yeoh) who aided Bond in Hong Kong, but the idea fell through and Chang was created to replace her.[7][8]\n* Rachel Grant as Peaceful Fountains of Desire, a Chinese agent working for Mr. Chang, undercover as a masseuse.\n* Emilio Echevarr\u00eda as Raoul, the manager of a Havana cigar factory, and a British sleeper agent.\n* Vincent Wong as General Li\n* Joaquin Martinez as Elderly Cigar Factory Worker\n* Sim\u00f3n Andreu as Dr. \u00c1lvarez\n* Deborah Moore (the daughter of former Bond actor Roger Moore) as Airline Hostess\n* Mark Dymond as Mr. Van Bierk\n* Oliver Skeete as Concierge At The Fencing Club\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\nAfter the success of *The World Is Not Enough*, producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson asked the director Michael Apted to return to direct. Although Apted accepted, they rescinded the offer in order to ask Tony Scott and John Woo, who both declined. Scott claims to have suggested Quentin Tarantino as director, although Wilson denies that any formal negotiations were held with him. Pierce Brosnan suggested John McTiernan, Ang Lee and Martin Scorsese as potential choices, and informally discussed the idea of directing a Bond film with Scorsese on a flight. Brett Ratner, Stephen Hopkins and Stuart Baird were later in negotiations to direct, before Lee Tamahori was hired.[3]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Surfers\n![](image)J\u00f6kuls\u00e1rl\u00f3n, Iceland\nPrincipal photography of *Die Another Day* began on 11 January 2002 at Pinewood Studios.[9] The film was shot primarily in the United Kingdom, Iceland and C\u00e1diz, Spain. Other locations included Pinewood Studios' 007 Stage and Maui, Hawaii, in December 2001.\nLaird Hamilton, Dave Kalama, and Darrick Doerner performed the pre-title surfing scene at the surf break known as \"Jaws\" in Pe\u02bbahi, Maui,[10] while the shore shots were taken near C\u00e1diz and Newquay, Cornwall. Scenes inside Graves' diamond mine were also filmed in Cornwall, at the Eden Project. The scenes involving the Cuban locations of Havana and the fictional Isla de Los Organos were filmed at La Caleta, Spain.[11]\n\n\nThe scenes featuring Berry in a bikini (designed to resemble Ursula Andress' swimming costume in *Dr. No*) were shot in C\u00e1diz. The location was reportedly cold and windy, and footage has been released of Berry wrapped in thick towels between takes to avoid catching a chill.[12] Berry was injured during filming when debris from a smoke grenade flew into her eye. The debris was removed in a 30-minute operation.[13] Brosnan also sustained a knee injury during the shooting of an action scene in Cornwall.[14]\n\n\nGadgets and other props from every previous *Bond* film and stored in Eon Productions' archives appear in Q's warehouse in the London Underground. Examples include the jetpack in *Thunderball* and Rosa Klebb's poison-tipped shoe in *From Russia with Love*.[15] Q mentions that the watch he issues Bond is \"your 20th, I believe\", a reference to *Die Another Day* being the 20th Eon-produced Bond film.[16] In London, the Reform Club was used to shoot several places in the film, including the lobby and gallery at the Blades Club, MI6 Headquarters, Buckingham Palace, Green Park and Westminster. J\u00f6kuls\u00e1rl\u00f3n, Iceland was used for the car chase on the ice. Four Aston Martins and four Jaguars, all converted to four-wheel drive, were used (and wrecked) filming the sequence. A temporary dam was constructed at the mouth of the narrow inlet to keep the salty ocean water out and thus allow the lagoon to freeze.[17] Additional chase footage was filmed at Svalbard, Norway, Jostedalsbreen National Park, Norway, and RAF Little Rissington, Gloucestershire.[11] Manston Airport in Kent was used for the scenes involving the Antonov cargo plane scenes.[18] The scene in which Bond surfs the wave created by Icarus when Graves was attempting to kill Bond was shot on the blue screen. The waves, along with all the glaciers in the scene, are computer-generated.[19]\n\n\nThe hangar interior of the US Air Base in South Korea, shown crowded with Chinook helicopters, was filmed at RAF Odiham in Hampshire, UK, as were the helicopter interior shots during the Switchblade sequence. These latter scenes, though portrayed in the air, were actually filmed entirely on the ground with the sky background being added in post-production using blue screen techniques. Although the base is portrayed in the film as a US base, all the aircraft and personnel in the scene are British in real life. In the film, Switchblades (one-person gliders resembling fighter jets in shape) are flown by Bond and Jinx to stealthily enter North Korea. The Switchblade was based on a workable model called \"PHASST\" (Programmable High Altitude Single Soldier Transport). Kinetic Aerospace Inc.'s lead designer, Jack McCornack was impressed by director Lee Tamahori's way of conducting the Switchblade scene and commented: \"It's brief, but realistic. The good guys get in unobserved, thanks to a fast cruise, good glide performance, and minimal radar signature. It's a wonderful promotion for the PHASST.\"[20]\n\n\nThe satellite attack at the end of the film was at first written to take place in Manhattan, but after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, it was moved to the Korean Demilitarized Zone.[3]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Die Another Day (soundtrack)\n\nThe soundtrack was composed by David Arnold and released on Warner Bros. Records.[21] He again made use of electronic rhythm elements in his score, and included two of the new themes created for *The World Is Not Enough*. The first, originally used as Renard's theme, is heard during the mammoth \"Antonov\" cue on the recording, and is written for piano. The second new theme, used in the \"Christmas in Turkey\" track of *The World Is Not Enough*, is reused in the \"Going Down Together\" track.[22]\n\n\nThe title song for *Die Another Day* was co-written and co-produced by Mirwais Ahmadzai and performed by Madonna, who also had a cameo in the film as Verity, a fencing instructor. The concept of the title sequence is to represent Bond trying to survive 14 months of torture at the hands of the North Koreans. Critics' opinions of the song were sharply divided; it was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Original Song and the 2004 Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording,[23] but also for a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Original Song of 2002 (while Madonna herself won the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actress for her cameo). In a MORI poll for the Channel 4 programme *\"James Bond's Greatest Hits\"*, the song was voted 9th out of 22, and also came in as an \"overwhelming number one\" favourite among those under the age of 24.[24]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nReportedly, twenty companies paying $70 million had their products featured in the film, a record at the time,[25] although *USA Today* reported that number to be as high as $100 million.[26]\n\n\nThe eleventh-generation Ford Thunderbird was featured in the film as Jinx's car, with a coral colour paying homage to a paint option for the original model, and matching her bikini. Ford produced a limited-edition *007*-branded 2003 Thunderbird as a tie-in for the film, featuring a similar paint job.[27]\n\n\nRevlon produced \"*007* Colour Collection\" makeup inspired by Jinx.[28] Bond Barbie dolls inspired by the franchise were also produced, featuring a red shawl and an evening dress designed by Lindy Hemming, and sold in a gift set with Ken posing as Bond in formal wear designed by the Italian fashion house Brioni.[29]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n*Die Another Day* had its world premiere on 18 November 2002 at the 56th Royal Film Performance, a fundraising event held in aid of The Film and TV Charity. The event took place at the Royal Albert Hall in London and Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip were guests of honour.[30] The Royal Albert Hall had a makeover for the screening and had been transformed into an ice palace. Proceeds from the premiere, about \u00a3500,000, were donated to The Film and Television Charity, of which the Queen was patron.[31]\n\n\n*Die Another Day* was controversial in the Korean Peninsula. The North Korean government disliked the portrayal of their state as brutal and war-hungry. The South Koreans boycotted 145 theatres where it was released on 31 December 2002, as they were offended by the scene in which an American officer issues orders to the South Korean army in the defence of their homeland, and by a lovemaking scene near a statue of the Buddha. The Jogye Buddhist Order issued a statement that the film was \"disrespectful to our religion and does not reflect our values and ethics\". *The Washington Post* reported growing resentment in the nation towards the United States. An official of the South Korean Ministry of Culture and Tourism said that *Die Another Day* was \"the wrong film at the wrong time.\"[32]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Die Another Day* was released on DVD and VHS on 3 June 2003.[33]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\nOn the first day of release, ticket sales reached \u00a31.2 million at the UK box office.[34] *Die Another Day* grossed $47 million on its opening weekend in the US and Canada and was ranked number one at the box office.[35] The film would compete against *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* and *The Santa Clause 2* during the Thanksgiving weekend. Moreover, all three films were able to defeat the underperforming animated film *Treasure Planet*. Later on, *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* and *Die Another Day* would simultaneously reclaim the number one spot at the box office.[36] For six months, they were both the latest films to return to the top spot at the box office, until *Finding Nemo* joined the group in June 2003.[37] The film earned $160.9 million in the US and Canada, and $431.9 million worldwide, becoming the sixth highest-grossing film of 2002. Not adjusting for inflation, *Die Another Day* was the highest-grossing James Bond film until the release of *Casino Royale* in 2006.[38]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film received an approval rating of 56% based on 220 reviews, with an average rating of 6.1/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"Its action may be a bit too over-the-top for some, but *Die Another Day* is lavishly crafted and succeeds in evoking classic Bond themes from the franchise's earlier installments.\"[39] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 56 out of 100 based on 43 critics, indicating \"mixed and average reviews\".[40] Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade \"A\u2212\" on scale of A to F.[41]\n\n\nMichael Dequina of *Film Threat* praised the film as the best of the series to star Pierce Brosnan and \"the most satisfying installment of the franchise in recent memory.\"[40] Larry Carroll of CountingDown.com praised Lee Tamahori for having \"magnificently balanced the film so that it keeps true to the Bond legend, makes reference to the classic films that preceded it, but also injects a new zest to it all.\"[42] *Entertainment Weekly* magazine also gave a positive reaction, saying that Tamahori, \"a true filmmaker\", has re-established the series' pop sensuality.[43] A.O. Scott of *The New York Times* called the film the best of the *James Bond* series since *The Spy Who Loved Me.*[40] Roger Ebert of the *Chicago Sun-Times*, who gave the film three stars out of four, stated: \"This movie has the usual impossible stunts ... But it has just as many scenes that are lean and tough enough to fit in any modern action movie\".[44] Kyle Bell of Movie Freaks 365 stated in his review that the \"first half of *Die Another Day* is classic Bond\", but that \"things start to go downhill when the ice palace gets introduced.\"[45]\n\n\nSeveral reviewers felt the film relied too heavily on gadgets and special effects, with the plot being neglected. James Berardinelli of *ReelViews* said: \"This is a train wreck of an action film \u2013 a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force-feed James Bond into the mindless *XXX* mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs.\" Of the action sequences, he said: \"*Die Another Day* is an exercise in loud explosions and excruciatingly bad special effects. The CGI work in this movie is an order of magnitude worse than anything I have seen in a major motion picture. Coupled with lousy production design, *Die Another Day* looks like it was done on the cheap.\"[46] Gary Brown of the *Houston Community Newspapers* also described the weak point of the film as \"the seemingly non-stop action sequences and loud explosions that appear to take centre stage while the Bond character is almost relegated to second string.\"[47] Roger Moore, who played Bond in earlier films, said: \"I thought it just went too far \u2013 and that's from me, the first Bond in space! Invisible cars and dodgy CGI footage? Please!\"[48]\n\n\nThe amount of product placement in *Die Another Day* had been a contemporaneous point of criticism, with the BBC, *Time* and Reuters referring mockingly to the film using the title \"Buy Another Day\".[25][26] The producers subsequently chose to limit the number of companies involved in product placement to eight for the next Bond film, *Casino Royale,* in 2006.[26]\n\n\n\n### Retrospective[edit]\n\n\nDespite favour from fans who prefer Bond's more \"camp\" films, a comment piece in 2020 stated that it is \"considered by many to be the worst entry in James Bond's canon\" and compares unfavorably to *The Bourne Identity* (released months earlier), which \"ushered in a new era of violent, gritty action-espionage movies\" and gave rise to the \"stripped-down, no-nonsense\" Bond of Daniel Craig.[49]\nIt often occupies a low rank on Bond-related lists. In a 2021 Yahoo! survey consisting of 2200 experts and superfans, *Die Another Day* was ranked as the third-worst instalment after *Quantum of Solace* and *Spectre*. The authors of the study did, however, specify that \"every Bond film...is always someone's favourite\".[50] **Far Out** described it as Brosnan's \"strongest\" turn as Bond, describing it as a \"midway point\" between the more outlandish adventures and the more grounded films.[51]\n\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\n*Die Another Day* was novelised by the then-official James Bond writer, Raymond Benson, based on the screenplay by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade. An effort is made to depict some of the film's more outlandish elements with more believability, in the style of Fleming's original novels' use of cutting-edge technology. So, for example, the non-bodywork elements of the Aston Martin with its 'cloaking' function (the glass windows and rubber tyres) are described as having retractable covers to achieve the invisibility effect. Fan reaction to it was above average.[52] After its publication, Benson retired as the official James Bond novelist; a new series featuring the secret agent's adventures as a teenager, by Charlie Higson, was launched in 2005. As the novelisation was published after Benson's final original 007 novel, *The Man with the Red Tattoo*, it was the final literary work featuring Bond as originally conceived by Ian Fleming until the publication of *Devil May Care* by Sebastian Faulks in 2008 to mark the 100th anniversary of Fleming's birth.[53]\n\n\n*007 Legends*, released in 2012, features Daniel Craig's James Bond in a *Die Another Day* level.[54]\n\n\n\n## Cancelled spin-off[edit]\n\n\nSpeculation arose in 2003 of a spin-off film concentrating on Jinx, which was scheduled for a November/December 2004 release. It was originally reported that MGM was keen to set up a film series that would be a \"Winter Olympics\" alternative to the main series. In the late 1990s, MGM had originally considered developing a spin-off film based on Michelle Yeoh's character, Wai Lin, in 1997's *Tomorrow Never Dies*. The spin-off *Jinx* was announced in December 2002. Lee Tamahori initially wanted to direct, but Stephen Frears was ultimately hired. Berry and Michael Madsen were originally going to reprise their roles as Jinx and Falco, while Jinx's lover was going to be played by Javier Bardem. Bardem would later play villain Raoul Silva in *Skyfall* (2012). The film would have revolved around Jinx's entry into the NSA, revealing that she had been adopted by Falco after being orphaned in a bombing and being hired by him from the RAND Corporation to do a job at the NSA as a favour.[3][55][56] Wade described the film as \"a very atmospheric, Euro thriller, a Bourne-type movie.\"[3] However, despite much speculation of an imminent movie, on 26 October 2003, *Variety* reported that MGM had cancelled the project.[57] MGM instead decided to reboot the James Bond franchise with the next film, *Casino Royale*, with Daniel Craig portraying the role of the titular character.[58] In 2020, Berry revealed that the film was cancelled over its $80 million budget, saying: \"Nobody was ready to sink that kind of money into a black female action star.\"[59][60] Purvis and Wade said that this decision was influenced by the failure of several action films with female stars, including *Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle* and *Lara Croft: Tomb Raider \u2013 The Cradle of Life*, in 2003.[61]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Invisibility in fiction\n* Outline of James Bond\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Die Another Day\". *Lumiere*.

The film received critical acclaim, with praise for Craig's reinvention of the character and its departure from the tropes of previous *Bond* films. It grossed over $616\u00a0million worldwide, becoming the fourth highest-grossing film of 2006 and the highest-grossing *James Bond* film until the release of *Skyfall* (2012).

Principal photography took place in the Bahamas, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the Czech Republic, with interior sets built at Pinewood Studios and Barrandov Studios. *Casino Royale* features primarily practical stuntwork as opposed to the computer-generated placements seen in other *Bond* films.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n97. **^** \"Home - Cinemascore\". *CinemaScore*.

Eon Productions gained the rights to *Casino Royale* in 1999 after Sony Pictures Entertainment exchanged them for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's rights to *Spider-Man*.[12] In March 2004, Neal Purvis and Robert Wade began writing a screenplay for Pierce Brosnan as Bond, aiming to bring back the flavour of Ian Fleming's original *Bond* novels.[13] An early draft featured Bond backpacking in Madagascar and playing chess with Lord Lucan.[14] As the drafts became closer to being finalized, the opening scene in which Bond earns his 00 license was originally going to consist of an adaptation of either the short stories \"The Hildebrand Rarity\" or \"007 in New York.\" Rather than bombing the Skyfleet jet, there would have been a hijacking of a cruise ship in Cape Town.[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 18 November 2006, *Casino Royale* opened at the first position in 27 countries, with a weekend gross of $43.4\u00a0million in the non-UK, Irish, US and Canada markets.[92] The film retained the top spot at the worldwide box office for four weeks.[93] The film earned $167.4 million in the United States and Canada and $426.8\u00a0million from international territories, for a worldwide total of $594.2\u00a0million worldwide. It was the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2006.[5] It was the highest-grossing instalment of the *James Bond* series until *Skyfall* surpassed it in November 2012.[94] After subsequent re-releases, it has earned $616 million.[5]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMartin Campbell\n |\n| --- |\n| Films directed | * *The Sex Thief* (1973)\n* *Eskimo Nell* (1975)\n* *Three for All* (1975)\n* *Intimate Games* (1976)\n* *Edge of Darkness* (1985)\n* *Criminal Law* (1988)\n* *Defenseless* (1991)\n* *Cast a Deadly Spell* (1991)\n* *No Escape* (1994)\n* *GoldenEye* (1995)\n* *The Mask of Zorro* (1998)\n* *Vertical Limit* (2000)\n* *Beyond Borders* (2003)\n* *The Legend of Zorro* (2005)\n* *Casino Royale* (2006)\n* *Edge of Darkness* (2010)\n* *Green Lantern* (2011)\n* *The Foreigner* (2017)\n* *The Prot\u00e9g\u00e9* (2021)\n* *Memory* (2022)\n* *Dirty Angels* (TBA)\n* *Cleaner* (TBA)\n |\n| Produced only | * *Black Joy* (1977)\n* *Scum* (1979)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n103. ^ ***a*** ***b*** McCarthy, Todd (9 November 2006). \"Casino Royale\". *Variety*.

This made Craig the first actor ever to receive a BAFTA nomination for a performance as James Bond.[129] He also received the Evening Standard British Film Award for Best Actor.[130]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThough American radio personality Michael Medved gave the film three stars out of four, describing it as \"intriguing, audacious and very original\u00a0... more believable and less cartoonish, than previous 007 extravaganzas\"; he commented further that the \"sometimes sluggish pacing will frustrate some Bond fanatics.\"[120] Commentators such as Emanuel Levy concurred, feeling the ending was too long, and that the film's terrorist villains lacked depth, although he praised Craig and gave the film a B+ overall.[121] Other reviewers responded negatively, including Tim Adams of *The Observer*, who felt the film came off uncomfortably in an attempt to make the series grittier.[122]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn Britain, by omitting some of Le Chiffre's sadism and James Bond's reactions in the torture scene, the film received the desired BBFC 12A rating.[83] In the United States, two fight scenes were censored to achieve a PG-13 rating: the fight between Bond and the traitorous MI6 agent's contact Fisher, and the fight between Bond and Obanno in the stairway at the Casino Royale.[84]\n\n\nThe German edit of the film cuts a sequence where the bomb-planter at the airport breaks a man's neck, instead replacing it with an alternative take.[84] The mainland Chinese cut of the film also trims the torture scene and the stairway fight, as well as a shot of Bond cleaning his wound at the hotel, and a boat scene.\n\n\nThe fully uncensored version can be found on the Australian, Dutch, French, Hong Kong, Japanese, and Scandinavian Blu-ray and DVD releases, on UK Blu-ray releases from 2012 onwards (rated 15), and on the 4K UHD Blu-ray release (branded as an unrated \"extended\" cut).\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEon believed that it had relied too heavily on computer-generated imagery effects in the more recent films, particularly *Die Another Day*, and was keen to accomplish the stunts in *Casino Royale* \"the old fashioned way\".[23] In keeping with this drive for more realism, screenwriters Purvis, Wade and Haggis wanted the script to follow as closely as possible the original 1953 novel, keeping Fleming's darker storyline and characterization of Bond.[24]\nDue to copyright issues related to the ownership of *Thunderball*, the organization of which Mr White is a part is not named Spectre.[25]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn May 2005, British actor Daniel Craig stated that MGM and producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli had assured him he would get the role of Bond. Matthew Vaughn told reporters MGM had offered him the opportunity to direct the new film, but Eon Productions at that point had not approached either of them.[38] A year beforehand, Craig rejected the idea of starring, as he felt the series had descended into formula; only when he read the script did he become interested. Craig read all of Fleming's novels to prepare for the part, and cited Mossad and British Secret Service agents who served as advisers on the set of *Munich* as inspiring because, \"Bond has just come out of the service and he's a killer. [...] You can see it in their eyes, you know immediately: oh, hello, he's a killer. There's a look. These guys walk into a room and very subtly they check the perimeters for an exit. That's the sort of thing I wanted.\"[39]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Caterina Murino as Solange Dimitrios: Dimitrios's wife; Bond seduces her, causing her unintentionally to reveal one of his plans.

According to Corbould, \"CGI is a great tool and can be very useful, but I will fight to the tooth and nail to do something for real. It's the best way to go\".[50] Three scenes involving primarily physical effects in the film were the chase at a building site in Madagascar, the Miami Airport chase sequence, and the sinking Venetian house, with sets located on the Grand Canal and in Pinewood Studios.[50]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n138. **^** Thompson, Anne; Carl DiOrio (18 February 2007). \"*Casino*, *Curse*, top ADG Awards\". *The Hollywood Reporter*.

The site's critical consensus reads, \"*Casino Royale* disposes of the silliness and gadgetry that plagued recent James Bond outings, and Daniel Craig delivers what fans and critics have been waiting for: a caustic, haunted, intense reinvention of 007.\"[95] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 80 out of 100 based on 46 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[96] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\u2212\" on an A+ to F scale.[97]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 14 October 2005, Eon Productions, Sony Pictures Entertainment, and MGM announced at a press conference in London that Craig would be the sixth actor to portray James Bond. Taking time off from reshoots for *The Invasion*, a business-suit clad, rather long-haired Craig boarded a Royal Marines Rigid Raider from HMS\u00a0*Belfast* before travelling to HMS *President*, where he was introduced to the world's press.[40][41] Controversy followed the decision, with some critics and fans expressing doubt the producers had made the right choice. Throughout the entire production period, Internet campaigns such as \"danielcraigisnotbond.com\" expressed their dissatisfaction and threatened to boycott the film in protest.[42] Craig, unlike previous actors, was not considered by the protesters to fit the tall, dark, handsome and charismatic image of Bond to which viewers had been accustomed.[43] The *Daily Mirror* ran a front-page news story critical of Craig, with the headline, *The Name's Bland \u2013 James Bland*.[44]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n32. **^** \"'Avatar,' Sobriety and Hollywood Clashes: How Sam Worthington Lost and Found His Star Power\". 15 December 2022.

He claims to have worked behind the scenes with the Fleming family, and believed this was the reason why filmmakers finally went ahead with *Casino Royale*.[16] Tarantino also said he would have set it in the 1960s and would have only made it with Pierce Brosnan as Bond. In February 2005, Martin Campbell, who previously directed *GoldenEye* (1995), was announced as the film's director.[17] Campbell felt Purvis and Wade's draft needed a rewrite, and suggested hiring Paul Haggis whose main contribution was to rewrite the climax of the film. Haggis explained, \"the draft that was there was very faithful to the book and there was a confession, so in the original draft, the character confessed and killed herself. She then sent Bond to chase after the villains; Bond chased the villains into the house. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nSaturn Award for Best Action or Adventure Film\n |\n| --- |\n| * *Pulp Fiction* (1994)\n* *The Usual Suspects* (1995)\n* *Fargo* (1996)\n* *L.A.

As well as features present from the 2007 release, the collector's edition contains an audio commentary, deleted scenes, featurettes and a storyboard-to-film comparison.[79] A two-disc Blu-ray version also followed in late 2008, featuring additional supplementary materials, enhanced interactivity through BD-Live, and the previous version's 5.1 PCM soundtrack was replaced with a similar 5.1 Dolby TrueHD soundtrack.[80]\n\n\n*Casino Royale* was released a third time on Blu-ray in 2012 with DTS audio and deleted scenes, but it had fewer special features than the 2008 edition.[81] It was released on 4K UHD Blu-ray on 25 February 2020.[82]\n\n\n\n### Cuts and censorship[edit]\n\n\n*Casino Royale* was censored for its release in the UK, the US, Germany and China.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain article: Casino Royale (2006 soundtrack)\n\nThe soundtrack of *Casino Royale*, released by Sony Classical Records on 14 November 2006, featured music composed by veteran composer David Arnold, his fourth soundtrack for the *Bond* film series, while Nicholas Dodd orchestrated and conducted the score. Producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli announced on 26 July 2006 Chris Cornell had composed and would perform the title song, \"You Know My Name\".[63] The song's main notes are played throughout the film as a substitute for the James Bond Theme, to represent Bond's youth and inexperience. The classic theme only plays during the end credits to signal the climax of his character arc.[64]\n\n\n\n### Promotional marketers[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRoger Moore wrote, \"Daniel Craig impressed me so greatly in his debut outing, *Casino Royale*, by introducing a more gritty, unrefined edge to the character that I thought Sean [Connery] might just have to move over. Craig's interpretation was like nothing we'd seen on screen before; Jimmy Bond was earning his stripes and making mistakes. It was intriguing to see him being castigated by M, just like a naughty schoolboy would be by his headmaster. The script showed him as a vulnerable, troubled, and flawed character. Quite the opposite to my Bond! Craig was, and is, very much the Bond Ian Fleming had described in the books \u2013 a ruthless killing machine. It was a Bond that the public wanted.\" Moore also quipped that his praise was \"not heaped lightly,\" because he had to purchase the DVD himself.[116] Raymond Benson, the author of nine *Bond* novels, called *Casino Royale* \"a perfect *Bond* film.\"[117]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n133. **^** \"Casino Royale receives five Saturn Award nominations\". *MI6-HQ.COm*.

The scene with Bond on a sailboat was filmed aboard a 54-foot (16\u00a0m) yacht named *Spirit*. She was constructed by Spirit Yachts in Suffolk, England, and had to be demasted to fit under various Venetian bridges to reach the filming location. For this reason, SV *Spirit* \"was the first sailing boat to go up the Grand Canal in Venice for 300 years\".[56]\n\n\nOther scenes in the latter half of the film were shot in late May and early June at the Villa del Balbianello on the shores of Lake Como.[57] Further exterior shooting for the movie took place at properties such as the Villa La Gaeta, near the lakeside town of Menaggio.[43]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPrincipal photography for *Casino Royale* commenced on 3 January 2006 and concluded on 20 July 2006. The film was primarily shot at Barrandov Studios in Prague, with additional location shooting in the Bahamas, Italy, and the United Kingdom. The shoot concluded at Pinewood Studios.[50] Michael G. Wilson had stated *Casino Royale* would either be filmed or take place in Prague and South Africa. However, Eon Productions encountered problems in securing film locations in South Africa.[51] After no other locations became available, the producers had to reconsider their options. In September 2005, Martin Campbell and director of photography Phil M\u00e9heux were scouting Paradise Island in the Bahamas as a possible location for the film.[52] On 6 October 2005, Martin Campbell confirmed *Casino Royale* would film in the Bahamas and \"maybe Italy\". \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nArendt commented, \"Craig is the first actor to really nail 007's defining characteristic: he's an absolute swine\".[101]\n\n\nThe film was similarly well received in North America. MSNBC gave the movie a perfect 5 star rating.[104] The film was described as taking James Bond \"back to his roots\", similar to *From Russia with Love*,[105] where the focus was on character and plot rather than the high-tech gadgets and visual effects that were strongly criticized in *Die Another Day*.[103] *Entertainment Weekly* named the film as the fifth best of the series,[106] and chose Vesper Lynd as the fourth best Bond girl in the series.[107] Some newspaper columnists and critics were impressed enough by Craig's performance to consider him a viable candidate for an Academy Award nomination.[108][109][110]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe film met with mixed reactions from other critics. John Beifuss of *The Commercial Appeal* said, \"Who wants to see Bond learn a lesson about ego, as if he were Greg Brady in his 'Johnny Bravo' phase?\"[118] Anthony Lane of *The New Yorker* criticized the more imperfect and self-aware depiction of the character, saying, \"Even James Bond, in other words, wants to be 007.\"[119]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn designing the credit sequence for the film, graphic designer Daniel Kleinman was inspired by the cover of the 1953 British first edition of *Casino Royale*, which featured Ian Fleming's original design of a playing card bordered by eight red hearts dripping with blood. Kleinman said, \"The hearts not only represent cards but the tribulations of Bond's love story. So I took that as inspiration to use playing card graphics in different ways in the titles,\" like a club representing a puff of gun smoke, and slashed arteries spurting thousands of tiny hearts.[59] In creating the shadow images of the sequence, Kleinman digitized the footage of Craig and the film's stuntmen on the Inferno visual effects system, at Framestore CFC in London; the actors' silhouettes were incorporated into more than 20 digitally animated scenes depicting intricate and innovative card patterns. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe UK DVD has continued to sell well, with 1,622,852 copies sold since 19 March.[76] A copy of the Blu-ray Disc edition of *Casino Royale* was given out to the first 500,000 PAL PlayStation 3 owners who signed up to the PlayStation Network.[77] The DVD was released in a separate two-disc widescreen and fullscreen editions,[78] both of which includes the official music video for the film, and three documentaries detailing how Daniel Craig was chosen for the role of Bond, the filming, and an expanded version of the *Bond Girls Are Forever* documentary incorporating new interviews with *Casino Royale* cast members.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Judi Dench as M: The head of MI6. Although she feels she has promoted Bond too soon and chides him for his rash actions, she plays an important maternal figure in his life. Dench was the only cast member retained from the Pierce Brosnan films.\n* Tobias Menzies as Villiers: M's young secretary at MI6 headquarters. His character's last name is a reference to James Villiers, who portrayed Bill Tanner in *For Your Eyes Only*, and to the character of Amherst Villiers in the original novel.[9]\n* Isaach de Bankol\u00e9 as Steven Obanno: A leader of the Lord's Resistance Army, he is introduced to Le Chiffre by Mr. White to account his finances.\n* Simon Abkarian as Alex Dimitrios: A contractor in the international criminal underworld and associate of Le Chiffre, he is based in the Bahamas.\n* Ivana Mili\u010devi\u0107 as Valenka: Le Chiffre's girlfriend and henchwoman, she accompanies him to the poker game.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Casino Royale* was simultaneously released on DVD, UMD and Blu-ray on 16 March 2007.[73] In the UK, *Casino Royale* was released on 16 March 2007 on DVD and Blu-ray Disc.[74] The DVD and Blu-ray Disc releases broke sales records: the Region 1 Blu-ray Disc edition became the highest selling high-definition title to date, selling more than 100,000 copies since its release.[75] The region 2 DVD edition achieved the record of fastest selling title for its first-week release. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Award\n | Category\n | Recipients\n | Result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| American Cinema Editors Awards | Best Edited Feature Film \u2013 Dramatic | Stuart Baird | Nominated\n |\n| Art Directors Guild Awards | Excellence in Production Design for a Contemporary Film | Peter Lamont | Won\n |\n| British Academy Film Awards | Best Actor in a Leading Role | Daniel Craig | Nominated\n |\n| Best Adapted Screenplay | Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and Paul Haggis | Nominated\n |\n| Best Cinematography | Phil M\u00e9heux | Nominated\n |\n| Best Editing | Stuart Baird | Nominated\n |\n| Best Original Music | David Arnold | Nominated\n |\n| Best Production Design | Peter Lamont, Lee Sandales and Simon Wakefield\n | Nominated\n |\n| Best Sound | Chris Munro, Eddy Joseph, Mike Prestwood Smith, Martin Cantwell and Mark Taylor | Won\n |\n| Best Special Visual Effects | Steve Begg, Chris Corbould, John Paul Docherty and Ditch Doy\n | Nominated\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Aston Martin DBS driven by Bond in the film\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCraig's performance and credibility were particularly praised. During production, Craig had been subject to debate by the media and the public, as he did not appear to fit Ian Fleming's original portrait of the character as tall, dark and suave.[98] *The Daily Telegraph* compared the quality of Craig's characterization of Bond to Sean Connery's and praised the script as smartly written, noting how the film departed from the series' conventions. *The Times* compared Craig's portrayal of the character to that of Timothy Dalton, and praised the action as \"edgy\",[99] with another reviewer citing in particular the action sequence involving the cranes in Madagascar.[100] Critics Paul Arendt of BBC Films,[101] Kim Newman of *Empire*,[102] and Todd McCarthy of *Variety*[103] all described Craig as the first actor to truly embody Ian Fleming's James Bond from the original novel: ironic, brutal and cold. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*Casino Royale* includes a cameo by British entrepreneur Richard Branson (seen being TSA-screened at Miami International Airport). The cameo was cut out of the in-flight versions shown on British Airways' in-flight entertainment systems, and the Virgin Atlantic aircraft Branson supplied had its tail fin (bearing the company logo) obscured.[10] Brazilian model Alessandra Ambrosio makes an unspoken cameo as a tennis player.[11]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nI don't know why but I thought that Vesper had to be in the sinking house and Bond has to want to kill her and then try and save her.\"[18] Haggis also said they wanted \"to do for Bond what *Batman Begins* did for Batman.\"[19] Broccoli and Wilson thought that \"*Die Another Day* had become too fantastical\",[20] feeling the next film should be more realistic. Later that same year, Sony led a consortium that purchased MGM, allowing Sony to gain distribution rights starting with the film.[21] Broccoli also felt that frivolity didn't feel appropriate after the 9/11 attacks.[22]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBond awakens in hospital and recovers with Vesper at his side. He has Mathis apprehended after believing that he had tipped off Le Chiffre about his tell. Bond falls in love with Vesper and resigns from MI6. The couple sails to Venice. When M reveals that his winnings were never transferred to the British treasury, Bond realizes that Vesper has betrayed him. He tails her to a hand-off of the money, where gunmen spot him and take her captive inside a Venetian palace undergoing restoration. Bond shoots the building's flotation devices, causing it to gradually sink into the Grand Canal as he picks off the shooters. Vesper is imprisoned in the building's elevator and, after locking herself in to prevent Bond from saving her, drowns. Mr. White, meanwhile, escapes with the money.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn addition to the extensive location filming, studio work including choreography and stunt co-ordination practice was performed at the Barrandov Studios in Prague, and at Pinewood Studios, where the film used several stages, the paddock tank, and the 007 Stage. Further shooting in the UK was scheduled for Dunsfold Aerodrome in Surrey, the cricket pavilion at Eton College (although that scene was cut from the completed movie), and the Millbrook Vehicle Proving Ground in Bedfordshire.[43]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn Madagascar, Bond blows up an embassy while capturing and then killing a bomb-maker named Mollaka. MI6 chief M admonishes Bond for causing an international incident and ignoring her orders to take Mollaka alive. Information on Mollaka's phone leads Bond to the Bahamas and a corrupt Greek official, Alex Dimitrios, who had hired Mollaka at Le Chiffre's request to bomb Skyfleet's prototype airliner. After winning Dimitrios's vintage Aston Martin in a poker game and seducing his wife, Solange, Bond pursues Dimitrios to Miami. Bond fends off an attack by Dimitrios and kills him. At the airport, Bond chases down the new bomber Dimitrios has hired and thwarts the destruction of the Skyfleet airliner. With the Skyfleet stock secure, Le Chiffre loses Obanno's money. Surmising that somebody talked about the terrorist plot, Le Chiffre tortures Solange to death.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe next important casting was that of the lead Bond girl, Vesper Lynd. Casting director Debbie McWilliams acknowledged Hollywood actresses Angelina Jolie and Charlize Theron were \"strongly considered\" for the role. Belgian actress C\u00e9cile de France had also auditioned, but her English accent \"wasn't up to scratch.\"[45] French actress Audrey Tautou was also considered, but not chosen because of her role in *The Da Vinci Code*, which was another Columbia Pictures film released in May 2006.[46] Rachel McAdams turned down a role in the film to focus on raising her own family.[47] Olivia Wilde and French actress Eva Green were the two finalists for the part.[48] On 16 February 2006, Green was announced to play the part.[49]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe first scenes shot were ones involving a Madagascar building site, shot in the Bahamas on the site of a derelict hotel with which Michael G. Wilson had become acquainted in 1977 during the filming of *The Spy Who Loved Me*.[50] In the scene, Bond drives a digger towards the building, slamming into the concrete plinth on which Mollaka is running. The stunt team built a model and put forward several ways in which the digger could conceivably take out the concrete, including taking out the pillar underneath. A section of the concrete wall was removed to fit the digger and reinforced with steel.[50]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFurthermore, I consider Daniel Craig to be the most effective and appealing of the six actors who have played 007, and that includes even Sean Connery.\"[115]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe sinking of the Venetian house at the climax of the film featured the largest rig ever built for a Bond film,[50] with tank consisting of a Venetian piazza and the interior of an abandoned house being constructed. The rig, weighing some 90 tons, incorporated electronics with hydraulic valves that were closely controlled by computer because of the dynamic movement within the system on its two axes. The same computer system also controlled the exterior model, which the effects team had built to one-third scale to film the building eventually collapsing into the Venetian canal. The model lift within the rig could be immersed in 19 feet (5.8\u00a0m) of water, and used banks of compressors to strictly regulate movement.[50]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTo recoup his client's money, Le Chiffre organizes a Texas hold 'em tournament at the Casino Royale in Montenegro. MI6 enters Bond\u2014the agency's best poker player\u2014in the tournament, believing a defeat will force Le Chiffre to seek asylum with the British government in exchange for information on his clients. Bond is paired with Vesper Lynd, a British Treasury agent overseeing the $10\u00a0million buy-in. They meet their contact, Ren\u00e9 Mathis, in Montenegro. Obanno, furious that his money is missing, threatens Le Chiffre, but allows him to continue playing to win back the money. Obanno and his bodyguard attack Bond, who kills them both. Bond loses his $10\u00a0million stake after Le Chiffre is tipped off about his own tell, and Vesper refuses to authorize an additional $5\u00a0million for Bond to continue. However, fellow player Felix Leiter, a CIA agent, stakes Bond to the money in exchange for letting his agency take Le Chiffre into custody. Le Chiffre's lover, Valenka, poisons Bond's martini, but Vesper rescues him. \n</fragment>\n</document>",

In July 2006, Roger Michell was announced to direct with a planned release for May 2008, but he left the project that October after there were delays with the screenplay. Purvis, Wade, and Haggis completed the screenplay by June 2007, after which, Forster was announced as Michell's replacement. Craig and Forster also contributed uncredited rewrites to the film's screenplay. Principal photography began in August 2007 and lasted until May 2008, with filming locations including Mexico, Panama, Chile, Italy, Austria, and Wales, while interior sets were built and filmed at Pinewood Studios. The film's title is borrowed from a 1959 short story by Ian Fleming. In contrast to its predecessor, *Quantum of Solace* is notable for citing inspiration from early Bond film sets designed by Ken Adam, while it features a departure from tropes associated with Bond villains.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n58. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Newswrap No. 2 video\".

In this film, the gun barrel sequence was moved to the end, which Wilson explained was done for a surprise,[90] and to signify that the conclusion of the story had begun in the previous film. The opening credits were created by MK12. Having worked on Forster's *Stranger than Fiction* and *The Kite Runner*, MK12 spontaneously began developing the sequence early on, and had a good idea of its appearance which meant it did not have to be redone when the title singer was changed. MK12 selected various twilight colours to represent Bond's mood and focused on a dot motif based on the gun barrel shot. MK12 also worked on scenes with graphical user interfaces, including the electronic table MI6 uses,[91] and the Port-au-Prince, Haiti title cards.[92]\n\n\n\n### Effects[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"Bond 22 Pre-Production Diary (22)\".

Craig's physical training for his reprise of the role placed extra effort into running and boxing, to spare him the injuries he sustained on his stunts in the first film.[6] Craig felt he was fitter, being less bulky than in the first film.[7] He also practised speedboating and stunt driving. Craig felt *Casino Royale* was [physically] \"a walk in the park\" compared to *Quantum of Solace*, which required a different performance from him because *Quantum of Solace* is a revenge film, not a love story like *Casino Royale*.[7] While filming in Pinewood, he suffered a gash when kicked in his face,[8] which required eight stitches, and a fingertip was sliced off. He laughed these off, noting they did not delay filming, and joked his finger would enable him to have a criminal career (though it had grown back when he made this comment).[7] He also had minor plastic surgery on his face.[9] The actor advised Paul Haggis on the script and helped choose Marc Forster as the director.[10]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe wrote that the plot was mediocre, characters weak, and that Bond lacked his usual personality, despite his praise for Craig's interpretation of the role. Throughout his review, he emphasised that \"James Bond is not an action hero.\"[148] Kate Muir wrote in *The Times* that \"The *Bond* franchise is 50 years old this year, and the scriptless mess of *Quantum of Solace* may be considered its mid-life crisis\", before she went on to praise the film's successor *Skyfall* as a \"resurrection\".[149] Some writers criticised the choice of *Quantum of Solace* as a title. \"Yes, it's a bad title,\" wrote Marni Weisz, the editor of *Famous*, a Canadian film publication distributed in cinemas in that country, in an editorial entitled \"At least it's not *Octopussy*.\"[150]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. **^** \"Bond actor admits plastic surgery\". *BBC News Online*. 9 October 2008.

He praised the film's shorter runtime, claiming that many other *Bond* films run out of steam before the end, and included *Casino Royale* in this category. Describing the film as having a \"rock-solid dramatic idea and the intelligence to run with it\", he gave the film four stars out of five.[151]\n\n\nCraig retrospectively stated that the 2007\u201308 Writers Guild of America strike negatively impacted on the production and end result of *Quantum of Solace*,[152][153] During a 2021 interview on *The Empire Film Podcast*, Craig described the film as a \"shit-show\" and referred to it as one of his least favourite performances as Bond.[154]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nRoger Moore, the third actor to play Bond in the films, said that Craig was a \"damn good Bond but the film as a whole, there was a bit too much flash cutting [and] it was just like a commercial of the action.

The site's critical consensus reads: \"Brutal and breathless, *Quantum Of Solace* delivers tender emotions along with frenetic action, but coming on the heels of *Casino Royale*, it's still a bit of a disappointment.\"[139] On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 58 out of 100 based on 48 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[140] Critics generally preferred *Casino Royale*, but continued to praise Craig's depiction of Bond, and agree that the film is still an enjoyable addition to the series. The action sequences and pacing were praised, but criticism grew over the realism and serious but gritty feeling that the film carried over.[141] The film earned an average grade of \"B\u2212\" from CinemaScore's audience surveys, on an A+ to F scale, the lowest of the Craig's era as Bond.[142]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nEmpire Award for Best Thriller\n |\n| --- |\n| * *Kiss Kiss Bang Bang* (2006)\n* *The Departed* (2007)\n* *American Gangster* (2008)\n* *Quantum of Solace* (2009)\n* *Sherlock Holmes* (2010)\n* *The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo* (2011)\n* *Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy* (2012)\n* *Headhunters* (2013)\n* *The Hunger Games: Catching Fire* (2014)\n* *The Imitation Game* (2015)\n* *Spectre* (2016)\n* *Jason Bourne* (2017)\n* *Kingsman: The Golden Circle* (2018)\n |\n\n| Authority control databases ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n |\n| --- |\n| International | * VIAF\n |\n| National | * France\n* BnF data\n* Germany\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWilson, noting they only blocked two very expensive ideas he had.[16] The director found *Casino Royale*'s 144-minute running time too long, and wanted his follow-up to be \"tight and fast \u2026 like a bullet\".[43]\n\n\n\n\n> Because Bond plays it real, I thought the political circumstances should be real too, even though Bond shouldn't be a political film.

Born in Germany and raised in Switzerland, Forster was the first Bond director not to come from the British Commonwealth of Nations, although he noted that Bond's mother is Swiss, making him somewhat appropriate to handle the British icon.[42] The director collaborated strongly with Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWilson decided on the title *Quantum of Solace* only \"a few days\" before its announcement on 24 January 2008.[23] It was the name of a short story in Ian Fleming's anthology *For Your Eyes Only* (1960).[52] The film is related to the title in one of its thematic elements: \"when the *Quantum of Solace* drops to zero, humanity and consideration of one human for another is gone\". Daniel Craig admitted, \"I was unsure at first. Bond is looking for his quantum of solace and that's what he wants, he wants his closure. Ian Fleming says that if you don't have a quantum of solace in your relationship then the relationship is over. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nImmediately following the events of *Casino Royale*, James Bond is driving from Lake Garda to Siena, Italy, with the captured Mr. White in the trunk of his Aston Martin DBS V12. After evading pursuers, Bond delivers White to M, who interrogates White regarding the mysterious organisation Quantum. When White responds that their operatives are everywhere, M's bodyguard Craig Mitchell suddenly shoots one of the guards and attacks M. Bond chases Mitchell and eventually kills him; in the confusion, White escapes. Searching Mitchell's flat in London, Bond and M discover Mitchell had a contact named Edmund Slate in Haiti. Bond learns Slate is a hitman sent to kill Camille Montes at the behest of her lover, environmentalist entrepreneur Dominic Greene. Observing her subsequent meeting with Greene, Bond learns Greene is helping exiled Bolivian General Medrano, who murdered Camille's family, to overthrow the government and become the new president in exchange for a seemingly barren piece of desert.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Screen Daily* says, \"Notices will focus\u2014rightly\u2014on Craig's magnetism as the steely, sexy, murderous MI6 agent, but two other factors weigh in and freshen up proceedings: Forster's new technical team, led by cinematographer Roberto Schaefer and production designer Dennis Gassner. And the ongoing shift of M, as played by Judi Dench, to front and centre: the Bond girls fade into insignificance as she becomes his moral counterpoint and theirs is the only real relationship on screen.\" The review continues, \"Bond is, as has been previously noted, practically the Martin Scorsese of the BAFTAs: 22 films later, with grosses probably close to the GDP of one of the small nations it depicts, it's still waiting for that Alexander Korda award. The best *Casino Royale* could achieve was a gong for sound. Will this be the year that changes its fortunes?\"[147] Roger Ebert of the *Chicago Sun-Times*, who praised the previous film, disliked *Quantum of Solace*. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe no longer represents anything particularly British, or even modern. In place of glamour, we get a spurious grit; instead of style, we get product placement; in place of fantasy, we get a redundant and silly realism.\"[145] *The Guardian* gave the film 3 stars, and was particularly fond of Craig's performance, saying he \"made the part his own, every inch the coolly ruthless agent-killer, nursing a broken heart and coldly suppressed rage\" and calling the film \"a crash-bang Bond, high on action, low on quips, long on location glamour, short on product placement\"; it concludes \"*Quantum of Solace* isn't as good as *Casino Royale*: the smart elegance of Daniel Craig's Bond debut has been toned down in favour of conventional action. But the man himself powers this movie; he carries the film: it's an indefinably difficult task for an actor. Craig measures up.\"[146]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n22. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Tilly, Chris (30 January 2008). \"Gemma Arteron Q&A\". *IGN*. Archived from the original on 1 February 2008.

It is the first Bond game to feature Craig's likeness and the first seventh-generation console game in the series. Swatch designed a series of wrist watches, each of them inspired by a Bond villain.[127]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Moving Picture Company created the climactic hotel sequence. The fire effects were supervised by Chris Corbould, and post-production MPC had to enhance the sequence by making the smoke look closer to the actors, so it would look more dangerous.[97] A full-scale replica of the building's exterior was used for the exploding part Bond and Camille escape from. The boat chase was another scene that required very little CGI. Machine FX worked on replacing a few shots of visible stuntmen with a digital version of Craig's head,[98] and recreated the boats Bond jumps over on his motorcycle to make it look more dangerous.[97] Crowd creation was done for the *Tosca* scene by Machine FX, to make the performance look like it had sold out.[98] Forster edited the opera scene to resemble *The Man Who Knew Too Much*.[66] In total, there are 900+ visual effects shots in *Quantum of Solace*.[97]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Quantum of Solace (soundtrack)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe film was nominated for Best Original Score, Best Original Song, Visual Effects, Film and Sound Editing at the 2008 Satellite Awards, winning Best Song.[155] It was nominated for Best Action Movie at the 2009 Critics' Choice Awards,[156] and at the Empire Awards, which is voted for by the public, it was shortlisted for Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Newcomer, Best Thriller and Best Soundtrack.[157] It was nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Action/Adventure/Thriller Film, while Kurylenko and Dench were both nominated for the Best Supporting Actress award.[158] It was nominated by the Visual Effects Society Awards for \"Outstanding Compositing in a Feature Motion Picture.\"[159]\n\n\nMovie critic Gilbert Cruz listed the film's pre-titles sequence as the eighth-greatest car chase in film history.[160]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Film portal\n\n\n* Eco-terrorism in fiction\n* Outline of James Bond\n* Cochabamba Water War\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Quantum of Solace* was shot in six countries.[5] Second unit filming began in Italy at the Palio di Siena horse race on 16 August 2007,[55] although at that point Forster was unsure how it would fit into the film.[49] Some scenes were filmed also in Maratea and Craco, two small distinctive towns in Basilicata in southern Italy.[56] Other places used for location shooting were Madrid in August 2007;[57] Baja California, Mexico in early 2008, for shots of the aerial battle;[58][59] Malcesine, Limone sul Garda and Tremosine in Italy during March,[60] and at Talamone during the end of April.[61] The main unit began on 3 January 2008[16] at Pinewood Studios. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThough the screenplay was not novelised despite its original storyline, Penguin Books published a compilation of Fleming's short stories entitled *Quantum of Solace: The Complete James Bond Short Stories*, with a UK release date of 29 May 2008[128] and a North American release date of 26 August 2008.[129] The book combines the contents of Fleming's two short story collections, *For Your Eyes Only*\u2014including the original \"Quantum of Solace\" short story\u2014and *Octopussy and The Living Daylights*.\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBond travels to Kazan, Russia, where he finds Vesper Lynd's former lover, Yusef Kabira, a member of Quantum who seduces female agents with valuable connections and is indirectly responsible for her death. After saving Kabira's latest target, Corrine, who works in Canadian intelligence, Bond allows MI6 to arrest Kabira. Outside, M tells Bond that Greene was found dead in the middle of the desert, shot twice in the head with some engine oil found in his stomach. Bond admits that M was right about Vesper.

Wilson also called Gassner's designs \"a postmodern look at modernism\".[63] Forster said he felt the early Bond films' design \"were ahead of their time\",[46] and enjoyed the clashing of an older style with his own because it created a unique look unto itself.[85] Gassner wanted his sets to emphasise Craig's \"great angular, textured face and wonderful blue eyes\", and totally redesigned the MI6 headquarters because he felt Judi Dench \"was a bit tired in the last film, so I thought, let's bring her into a new world\".[86]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFilming took place at the floating opera stage at Bregenz, Austria, from 28 April \u2013 9 May 2008. The sequence in which Bond stalks the villains during a performance of *Tosca* required 1,500 extras.[78] The production used a large model of an eye, which Forster felt fitted in the Bond style, and the opera itself has parallels to the film.[79] A short driving sequence was filmed at the nearby Feldkirch, Vorarlberg.[80] The crew returned to Italy from 13 to 17 May to shoot a (planned) car crash at the marble quarry in Carrara,[81] and a recreation of the Palio di Siena at the Piazza del Campo in Siena. 1,000 extras were hired for a scene where Bond emerges from the *Fonte Gaia*. Originally, he would have emerged from the city's cisterns at Siena Cathedral, but this was thought disrespectful.[61] By June the crew returned to Pinewood for four weeks,[79] where new sets (including the interior of the hotel in the climax) were built.[45][63] The wrap party was held on 21 June.[82]\n\n\n\n### Design[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n104. **^** Tommy Pearson, David Arnold (November 2007). *Interview with David Arnold* (Audio interview).

Tom Ford was hired to tailor \"sharper\" suits for Craig. Pugh said the costumes aimed towards the 1960s feel, especially for Bond and Fields. Prada provided the dresses for both Bond girls. Jasper Conran designed Camille's ginger bandeau, bronze skirt and gold fish necklace,[87] while Chrome Hearts designed gothic jewelry for Amalric's character, which the actor liked enough to keep.[88] Sophie Harley, who created Vesper Lynd's earrings and Algerian loveknot necklace in *Casino Royale*, was asked to create another version of the necklace.[89]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n155. **^** \"2008 13th Annual SATELLITE Awards\".

Wilson announced that Neal Purvis and Robert Wade were working on a screenplay for the next film. They deliberately wrote *Casino Royale* to tie in to the next film so they could exploit Bond's emotions following Vesper's death in the previous film.[32] Purvis and Wade's first storyline followed Bond releasing Mr. White in Siena so that he could follow him and find his employers. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIt's that spark of niceness in a relationship that if you don't have you might as well give up.\"[13] He said that \"Bond doesn't have that because his girlfriend [Vesper Lynd] has been killed\",[52] and therefore, \"[Bond is] looking for revenge \u2026 to make himself happy with the world again\".[23] Afterwards, Quantum was made the name of the organisation introduced in *Casino Royale*.[53] Craig noted the letter Q itself looks rather odd.[7] Near the end of the film, the Camille Montes character and Bond have a discussion about their individual quests to avenge the deaths of their loved ones. Montes asks Bond to \"let me know what it feels like\" when he succeeds, the implication of the title being that it will be a small amount of solace compared to his despair. Bond's lack of emotion when he does exact revenge shows this to be the case.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Joaqu\u00edn Cos\u00edo as General Medrano, the exiled general whom Greene is helping to get back into power, in return for support of his organisation.

Taubman wanted to make Elvis \"as colourful, as edgy and as interesting as possible\", with one of his suggestions being the bowl cut.[26] Amalric and Taubman improvised a backstory for Elvis: he is Dominic's cousin and once lived on the streets before being inducted into Quantum. He called Elvis \"a bit of a goofball. He thinks he's all that but he's not really.\u00a0\u2026 He's not a comic guy.

He said that Forster likes to work very closely with his composers and that, in comparison to the accelerated schedule he was tied to on *Casino Royale*, the intention was to spend a long time scoring the film to \"really work it out.\" He also said he would be \"taking a different approach\" with the score.[104] Arnold composed the music based on impressions from reading the script, and Forster edited those into the film.[105] As with *Casino Royale*, Arnold kept use of the \"James Bond Theme\" to a minimum.[49] Arnold collaborated with Kieran Hebden for \"Crawl, End Crawl,\" a remix of the score played during the end credits.[106]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFrom 4\u201312 April, the main unit shot on Sienese rooftops.[61] Shooting on the real rooftops turned out to be less expensive than building them at Pinewood.[5] The next four weeks were scheduled for filming the car chase at Lake Garda and Carrara.[61] On 14 April, a closing scene featuring Jesper Christensen's Mr. White and Paul Ritter's Guy Haines getting killed by Bond after Bond said his iconic \"Bond, James Bond\" line was reportedly filmed, but the filmmakers removed it during post-production in case they decided to bring back Mr. White and/or continue the Quantum story arc in future sequels. The scene's deletion later enabled Mr. White's return in *Spectre*.[74] On 19 April, an Aston Martin employee driving a DBS to the set crashed into the lake. He survived, and was fined \u00a3400 for reckless driving.[75] Another accident occurred on 21 April, and two days later, two stuntmen were seriously injured, with one, Greek stuntman Aris Comninos, having to be put in intensive care. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUpon its opening in the UK, the film grossed \u00a34.9\u00a0million ($8\u00a0million), breaking the record for the largest Friday opening (31 October 2008) in the UK.[132] The film then broke the UK opening-weekend record, taking \u00a315.5\u00a0million ($25\u00a0million) in its first weekend, surpassing the previous record of \u00a314.9\u00a0million held by *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire*. It earned a further \u00a314\u00a0million in France and Sweden\u2014where it opened on the same day. The weekend gross of the equivalent of $10.6\u00a0million in France was a record for the series, surpassing what *Casino Royale* made in five days by 16%. The $2.7\u00a0million gross in Sweden was the fourth-highest opening for a film there.[133][134]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter foiling Camille's assassination attempt on Medrano by \"rescuing\" her, Bond follows Greene to a performance of *Tosca* in Bregenz, Austria. Meanwhile, the head of the CIA's South American section, Gregg Beam, along with agent Felix Leiter, strike a noninterference deal with Greene for access to putative stocks of Bolivian oil, which the CIA believes to be the reason for Greene's interest in the land. Bond infiltrates Quantum's meeting at the opera, identifying Quantum's executive board members, and a gunfight ensues. A Special Branch bodyguard working for Quantum member Guy Haines, an advisor to the British PM, is thrown off a roof by Bond after refusing to answer his questions. He lands on Greene's car and is shot dead by one of his men. Assuming Bond killed the bodyguard, M orders him back to MI6 for debriefing. When he disobeys, she revokes his passports and cancels his payment cards. Bond heads to Talamone and convinces his old ally Ren\u00e9 Mathis to accompany him to Bolivia. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFourteen cameras were used to film the Palio di Siena footage, which was later edited into the main sequence. Aerial shots using helicopters were banned, and the crew were also forbidden from showing any violence \"involving either people or animals.\"[55] To shoot the foot chase in Siena in April 2008 four camera cranes were built in the town, and a cable camera was also used.[60] Framestore worked on the Siena chase, duplicating the 1,000 extras during principal photography to match shots of the 40,000-strong audience at the real Palio, removing wires that held Craig and the stuntmen in the rooftop segment of the chase, and digital expansion of the floor and skylight in the art gallery Bond and Mitchell fall into.[97] The art gallery fight was intended to be simple, but during filming Craig's stunt double accidentally fell from the construction scaffolding. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nForster chose her because out of the 400 women who auditioned, she seemed the least nervous.[11] When she read the script, she was glad she had no love scene with Craig; she felt it would have distracted viewers from her performance.[12] Kurylenko spent three weeks training to fight with weapons, and she learnt a form of indoor skydiving known as body flying.[13] Kurylenko said she had to do \"training non-stop from the morning to the evening\" for the action scenes, overcoming her fears with the help of Craig and the stunt team.[14][15] She was given a DVD box set of Bond films, since the franchise was not easily available to watch in her native Ukraine.[13] Kurylenko found Michelle Yeoh in *Tomorrow Never Dies* inspiring \"because she did the fight scenes by herself.\"[11] The producers had intended to cast a South American actress in the role,[16] thus, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe following day, Bond and Camille survey Quantum's intended land acquisition by air; their plane is damaged by a Bolivian fighter plane. They trick the plane into destroying itself, skydive into a sinkhole, and discover that Quantum has been secretly damming Bolivia's supply of fresh water to create a monopoly. Back in La Paz, Bond meets M and learns Quantum killed Fields by drowning her in crude oil. Bond meets Leiter, who discloses Greene and Medrano will meet at a hotel, *La Perla de las Dunas*, in the Atacama Desert to finalize their agreement, and warns him to escape as the CIA's Special Activities Division arrives.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\"Sarkozy, is just a better actor than [his presidential opponent] S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal\u2014that's all,\" he explained.[20] Amalric and Forster reconceived the character, who was supposed to have a \"special skill\" in the script, to someone who uses pure animal instinct when fighting Bond in the climax.[21] Bruno Ganz was also considered for the part,[16] but Forster decided Amalric gave the character a 'pitiful' quality.[21]\n* Giancarlo Giannini as Ren\u00e9 Mathis, Bond's ally who was mistakenly believed to be a traitor in *Casino Royale*. Having been acquitted, he chooses to help Bond again in his quest to find out who betrayed him.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nForster preferred the idea of Bond hanging from ropes reaching for his gun to kill Mitchell, rather than having both men run out of the building to continue their chase as specified in the script, and the number of effects shots increased.[97]\n\n\nTo film the aerial dogfight, a \"Snakehead\" camera was built and placed on the nose and tail of a Piper Aerostar 700. SolidWorks, who provided the software used to design the camera, stated \"pilots for the first time can fly as aggressively as they dare without sacrificing the drama of the shot.\" The camera could turn 360 degrees and was shaped like a periscope.[100] The crew also mounted SpaceCams on helicopters, and placed cameras with 1600mm lenses underground, to cover the action.[58] Forster wanted to film the plane fight as a homage to Alfred Hitchcock's *North by Northwest*, and chose planes like the Douglas DC-3 to suit that.[85][101]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nPaul Haggis\n |\n| --- |\n| Films directed | * *Red Hot* (1993)\n* *Crash* (2004)\n* *In the Valley of Elah* (2007)\n* *The Next Three Days* (2010)\n* *Third Person* (2013)\n* *5B* (2018)\n |\n| Films written only | * *The Return of the Shaggy Dog* (1987)\n* *Million Dollar Baby* (2004)\n* *The Last Kiss* (2006)\n* *Flags of Our Fathers* (2006)\n* *Letters from Iwo Jima* (2006)\n* *Casino Royale* (2006)\n* *Quantum of Solace* (2008)\n |\n| TV series created | * *City* (1990)\n* *You Take the Kids* (1990\u201391)\n* *Walker, Texas Ranger* (1993\u20132001)\n* *Due South* (1994\u201399)\n* *EZ Streets* (1996\u201397)\n* *Family Law* (1999\u20132002)\n* *The Black Donnellys* (2007)\n |\n| Other works | * \"We Are the World 25 for Haiti\" (2010 music video, directed)\n* *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3* (2011 video game, wrote)\n* *Show Me a Hero* (2015 miniseries, directed)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Simon Kassianides as Yusef Kabira, a member of Quantum who seduces female agents and manipulates them into giving away classified information.

Princes William and Harry attended, and proceeds from the screening were donated to the charities Help for Heroes and the Royal British Legion.[113] The film was originally scheduled to be released in the UK and North America on 7 November; however, Eon pushed forward the British date to 31 October during filming,[114] while the American date was pushed back in August to 14 November, after *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince* had been moved to 2009, thereby allowing the distributors to market the film over the autumn blockbuster Thanksgiving holiday weekend.[115] In Australia, the film was moved a week to 19 November, after 20th Century Fox chose to release *Australia* on *Quantum of Solace*'s original date of 26 November.[116]\n\n\n\n### Marketing[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDuring the shooting in the wind tunnel Craig and Kurylenko wore wind-resistant contact lenses that enabled them to open their eyes as they fell. For safety and comfort, they only shot for 30 seconds at a time.[103] Forster wished he had had more time to work on the free-fall scene.[97]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe following week, the film was playing in 60 countries. It grossed the equivalent of $39.3\u00a0million in the UK, $16.5\u00a0million in France and $7.7\u00a0million in Germany on 7 November 2008.[135] The film broke records in Switzerland, Finland, United Arab Emirates, Nigeria, Romania and Slovenia. Its Chinese and Indian openings were the second-largest ever for foreign-language films.[136]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFilming of the scenes was temporarily halted so that Italian police could investigate the causes of the accidents.[76] Stunt co-ordinator Gary Powell said the accidents were a testament to the realism of the action.[48] Rumours of a \"curse\" spread among tabloid media, something which deeply offended Craig, who disliked that they compared Comninos's accident to something like his minor finger injury later on the shoot (also part of the \"curse\"). Comninos recovered safely from his injury.[7]\n\n\nFor the role Craig trained to be less bulky than in *Casino Royale* and told *Men's Fitness* magazine \"In fact, I was much fitter for this film compared to *Casino Royale* \u2013 I really had to be \u2013 and I was running a hell of a lot more in training, just so I could do these scenes, whereas last time I spent far more time pumping heavy weights to bulk up so I could look big.\"[77]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThey are greeted by Strawberry Fields, a consular employee who demands Bond return to the UK immediately. Bond seduces her, and they attend a fundraising party held by Greene. At the party, Bond again rescues Camille from Greene, and they leave. The Bolivian police pull Bond and Camille over but discover Mathis unconscious in the car's boot. One of the officers shoots Mathis before Bond kills both of them. Mathis dies in Bond's arms, urging him to forgive Vesper and himself.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe free-fall scene involved its own set of challenges; director Marc Forster didn't want to shoot the scene against a green screen.[102] The scene was shot in an air tunnel at Bodyflight, which offers the same effects as skydiving.[102] Daniel Craig and Olga Kurylenko did their own stunts for this scene.[102] While a great solution for the actors' performances, the technique presented enormous VFX challenges: relighting shots captured in a tall white tube to match the sky over the Bolivian desert; and the impossibility of filming medium to wide shots of the actors. An array of eight Dalsa Origin cameras (supported by seven HD cameras and a 35mm hand-held camera, all running in sync) was used to create a virtual camera with which to shoot the actors floating in the simulator. Ged Wright and his team at Double Negative[98] developed a method to use the data from these cameras that allowed these real performances to be placed in a synthetic environment as seen by a synthetic camera.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Mathieu Amalric as Dominic Greene, the main villain. He is a leading member of Quantum posing as a businessman working in reforestation and charity funding for environmental science. In the 2015 Bond film *Spectre*, he is revealed to have been a member of the titular crime syndicate, of which Quantum is a subsidiary. \n</fragment>\n</document>",

The original screenplay would have more closely followed the literary series' story arc with Bond becoming an amnesiac and unknowingly impregnating his lover Lily in Turkey, who would have tracked him down to London after he returned to MI6. It would have featured Bond tracking down a Francisco Scaramanga-esque villain into the Andes Mountains, and would have had a \"*Heart of Darkness* feel.\"[59] The screenplay was delayed because of MGM's financial problems. At the end of 2010, Purvis and Wade completed a draft titled *Nothing is Forever* in which a villain called Raoul Sousa kills M with a bombing aboard the Barcelona Metro and leaves a bureaucrat named Mallender as the new M. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nsurpassing the \u00a394.03\u00a0million of *Avatar*.[123] By 30 December 2012, it had become the first film to gross more than \u00a3100\u00a0million ($161.6\u00a0million) in the UK.

Mendes, who had previously worked with Craig on *Road to Perdition*, was approached after seeing Craig in *A Steady Rain*, meeting after a performance, where Craig broached the subject of directing a *Bond* film for the first time.[50] He was at first hesitant, as the job had little appeal to him, but he did not reject the offer immediately because of Craig's involvement and enthusiasm; Mendes described Craig's casting and performance in *Casino Royale* as being what he felt the *Bond* franchise needed. He agreed to direct after meeting producers Michael G. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMendes confirmed that China would feature in the film, with shooting scheduled for Shanghai and \"other parts\" of the country.[19] Logan asserted that they deliberately sought locations that were \"in opposition\" to London, with an exotic quality as \"places for Bond to be uncomfortable\".[82] Scenes with the principal actors were not filmed on location in Shanghai, but in the UK. The Virgin Active pool in London's Canary Wharf acted as Bond's hotel pool,[77][82] Ascot Racecourse stood in for Shanghai Pudong International Airport,[93][94] and London's Broadgate Tower was used as the entrance and lobby of the Shanghai office building. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPeter Morgan was originally commissioned to write a script, but left the project when MGM filed for bankruptcy and production of the film stalled; despite his departure, Morgan later stated that the final script was based on his original idea, retaining what he described as its \"big hook\".[54] Mendes denied this as \"just not true\", insisting that Morgan's approach had been discarded once he had agreed to direct.[55] Robert Wade later said that \"Neal and I were pretty steeped in Fleming. I think Peter was more interested in Le Carr\u00e9. It just didn't work.\"[56] Morgan cowrote the treatment *Once Upon a Spy* with Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, which had M being blackmailed by a Russian oligarch, who would be a former KGB agent she had an affair with while stationed in West Berlin during the Cold War. The script would have ended with Bond being forced to kill M.[57][58][42] Mendes disliked most of the script but asked to keep the ending with M's death.[57]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThree months later, due to a public inquiry into M's handling of the stolen hard drive, she is pressured to retire by Gareth Mallory, the chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament and a former SAS officer. Although she claims she is still useful, MI6's servers are hacked, and M receives a taunting computer message moments before the MI6 building explodes. Bond, who used his presumed death to retire, learns of the attack and returns to service in London. He fails a series of physical, medical, and psychological examinations, but M approves his return to the field, ordering him to identify Patrice's employer, recover the hard drive, and kill Patrice. He meets Q, MI6's new quartermaster, who gives him a radio beacon and a Walther PPK pistol.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nInstructing Q and Bill Tanner to leave an electronic trail for Silva to follow, Bond uses his Aston Martin DB5 to take M to Skyfall, his childhood home in the Scottish Highlands. They meet Skyfall's gamekeeper Kincade, and together the trio set up a series of booby traps throughout the house. When Silva's men arrive, Bond, M, and Kincade kill most of them, but M is wounded. Silva arrives by helicopter with more men and heavy weapons, so Bond sends M and Kincade through a priest hole to hide in a nearby chapel, and rigs propane tanks to explode. As the house and the helicopter are destroyed, Bond escapes down the same tunnel.\n\n\nSilva survives the destruction of the house, following Kincade and M to the chapel. Confronting M, Silva forces his gun into her hand and presses his temple to hers, begging her to kill them both. Bond arrives and kills Silva by throwing a knife into his back. M then succumbs to her wounds and dies in Bond's arms.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nShe is all but the co-star of the film, with a lot of screen time, poignant dialogue, and a character who is far more complex and sympathetic than we expect in this series\".[142] Jenny McCartney, writing in *The Sunday Telegraph*, agreed, describing Dench as \"compellingly luminous\" in the film, and the one that \"the camera caresses most meaningfully and often\".[147] McCartney thought Javier Bardem played Silva \"with worrisome \u00e9lan\",[147] while Henry K Miller considered his character \"the most authentically Bondian Bond villain in decades\".[148] A number of critics noted the strength of the supporting cast; Kim Newman found the \"warmth and gravitas\" of Finney's performance noteworthy,[141] while other reviewers, including Edward Porter, Daniel Krupa and *The Playlist*'s Oliver Lyttelton, singled out Ralph Fiennes as Mallory and Ben Whishaw as Q.[149]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nRalph Fiennes was cast as Gareth Mallory,[37] a former lieutenant colonel in the British Army and now Chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee,[38] which regulates MI6.[39] At the end of the film, Mallory becomes the head of MI6, assuming the title of 'M'. During production, Fiennes stated that he could not say anything specific about the role other than that it was a \"really interesting part which is really quite fun\".[40] Fiennes had previously been considered to play Bond during the casting of *GoldenEye*.[41][42] Naomie Harris was cast as the returning character of Miss Moneypenny.[33] Harris's role was initially presented as that of Eve, an MI6 field agent who works closely with Bond. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*Skyfall* attracted some criticism from the US Sexual Violence Resource Center which, without having screened the film, expressed concern that Bond \"abuses his power and authority\" in a scene that suggests Bond initiates sexual intercourse with S\u00e9v\u00e9rine, a former victim of sex trafficking.[116]\n\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA number of reviewers praised Daniel Craig's lead performance. Roger Ebert believed that in *Skyfall*, \"Daniel Craig [takes] full possession of a role he earlier played well in 'Casino Royale,' not so well in 'Quantum'\";[142] Philip French commented that \"Craig manages to get out of the shadow of [Sean] Connery\";[144] while Daniel Krupa thought Craig's Bond was a \"defining performance\" for \"a great actor\".[145] Edward Porter, writing in *The Sunday Times*, considered that \"Craig has developed an authoritative Bond persona, dry and intelligent\".[146] Ryan Gilbey thought Craig had \"relaxed into Bond without losing any steeliness\".[143]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn Istanbul, MI6 agents James Bond and Eve Moneypenny pursue mercenary Patrice, who has stolen a hard drive containing details of undercover agents. As Bond and Patrice fight atop a moving train, M orders Moneypenny to shoot Patrice, despite not having a clear shot; Moneypenny inadvertently hits Bond, who falls into a river. Bond is presumed dead and Patrice escapes with the hard drive.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDespite media speculation that Harris had been cast as Miss Moneypenny,[43][44] this was not confirmed by anyone involved in production, with Harris herself dismissing claims that Eve was in fact Moneypenny.[45] According to Harris, Eve \"[believes] she is Bond's equal, but she is really his junior\".[46] Another returning character was Q, played by Ben Whishaw.[47] Mendes had initially declined to confirm which part Whishaw would play,[20] and later said the idea of the re-introduction was his, saying, \"I offered ideas about Moneypenny, Q and a flamboyant villain and they said yes\". To play the part of Kincade, Mendes cast Albert Finney.[48] The producers briefly considered approaching Sean Connery to play the role in a nod to the 50th anniversary of the series, but decided not to as they felt Connery's presence would have been seen as stunt casting and might disengage the audience.[49]\n\n\n\n#### Crew[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n104. **^** \"Adele to sing theme to new James Bond film Skyfall\". itv.com. 2 October 2012.

The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the action sequences, cast performances (particularly Craig's and Bautista's), and the musical score, but criticised the pacing and formulaic narrative decisions. It grossed $880 million worldwide, making it the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2015 and the second-highest grossing *James Bond* film after *Skyfall,* unadjusted for inflation. The film's theme song, \"Writing's on the Wall\", won an Academy Award and Golden Globe for Best Original Song.

Bond obtains a ring stylized with an octopus from the deceased[*failed verification*] attacker, Marco Sciarra, uncovering his connection to a secret organization.\n\n\nIn London, Gareth Mallory, the current M, suspends Bond for his unauthorized action. M is engaged in a power struggle with Max Denbigh (whom Bond dubs \"C\"), the Director-General of the new, privately backed Joint Intelligence Service formed by the merger of MI5 and MI6. C campaigns for Britain to join the global surveillance and intelligence initiative \"Nine Eyes\" and shut down the '00' section. Bond, who was operating on a mission posthumously assigned by the previous M to eliminate Sciarra and track down his employers, goes rogue from MI6, with Eve Moneypenny and Q agreeing to aid Bond covertly.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn London, Bond, Swann, M, Q, Bill Tanner and Moneypenny gather to arrest C. However, Swann and Bond are separately abducted by Spectre operatives while the others proceed with the plan. After Q stops Nine Eyes from going online, a fatal struggle between M and C results in C's death. Bond is taken to the ruins of the old MI6 building, scheduled for demolition after Silva's bombing,[N 2] where Swann is held captive. Blofeld, who survived the base's destruction with heavy scarring to his face, gives Bond a three-minute ultimatum to abandon Swann or attempt a rescue and risk death. Bond finds Swann and they escape as the building collapses. Bond shoots down Blofeld's helicopter, which crashes onto Westminster Bridge. Blofeld survives and is arrested by M.\n\n\nLater, Bond receives his restored Aston Martin DB5 from Q and drives off with Swann.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n45. **^** \"Spectre\". *Empire*.

Its critical consensus reads, \"*Spectre* nudges Daniel Craig's rebooted Bond closer to the glorious, action-driven spectacle of earlier entries, although it's admittedly reliant on established 007 formula.\"[178] Metacritic (which uses a weighted average) assigned *Spectre* a score of 60 out of 100 based on 48 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[179] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\u2212\" on an A+ to F scale.[170]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFive companies did the visual effects\u2014Industrial Light & Magic, Double Negative, Moving Picture Company, Cinesite and Peerless\u2014under the supervision of Steve Begg.

Scenes were also shot on the river near MI6's headquarters at Vauxhall Cross.[95] The crew returned to the river less than a week later to film scenes solely set on Westminster Bridge. The London Fire Brigade was on set to simulate rain as well as monitor smoke used for filming. Craig, Seydoux, and Waltz, as well as Harris and Fiennes, were seen being filmed.[96] Prior to this, scenes involving Fiennes were shot at a restaurant in Covent Garden.[97] Blofeld's helicopter crash was done with two full sized helicopter shells, which were rigged with steelwork and an overhead track. Computer-generated rotor blades and scenery damage were added in post-production. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter wrapping up in England, production travelled to Morocco in June, with filming taking place in Oujda, Tangier and Erfoud, after preliminary work was completed by the production's second unit.[98] The headquarters of Spectre in Morocco was located in Gara Medouar which is a 'crater' caused by erosion and of neither volcanic nor impact origin.[99] An explosion filmed in Morocco holds a Guinness World Record for the largest film stunt explosion in cinematic history, involving 8,140 litres of kerosene and 24 charges each with a kilogramme of high explosives.[100] The outside shots of a train in a desert featured the Oriental Desert Express.[101] Principal photography concluded on 5 July 2015.

The plot of *Spectre* also linked the events of *Skyfall* to Craig's first two *Bond* movies by revealing antagonist Raoul Silva to be associated with Spectre reverting *Skyfall*'s initial solo story status.[45] Various plot ideas were discussed and discarded during the writing process; Ralph Fiennes revealed in a 2021 podcast interview that at one stage Sam Mendes suggested a plot twist revealing M to be the villain, which Fiennes vetoed. Another draft by John Logan had MI6 chief of staff Bill Tanner uncovered as a Spectre mole.[46][47][48]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n175. **^** Nancy Tartaglione (20 December 2015). \"'Star Wars' Rules Galaxy; What Else Is Up At The International Box Office\". *Deadline Hollywood*.

Bautista's performance was inspired mostly by Oddjob from *Goldfinger*,[55] and said not talking created an acting challenge, \"trying to find this way where I am actually going to have to speak without speaking.\"[56] After casting B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Marlohe, a relative newcomer, as S\u00e9v\u00e9rine in *Skyfall*, Mendes sought out a more experienced actor for the role of Madeleine Swann, ultimately casting L\u00e9a Seydoux in the role.[57] Monica Bellucci joined the cast as Lucia Sciarra, becoming, at the age of fifty, the oldest actress to be cast as a Bond girl. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nShe had previously auditioned for the role of Paris Carver in *Tomorrow Never Dies*, but was passed over in favour of Teri Hatcher.[58] In a separate interview with Danish website Euroman, Jesper Christensen revealed he would be reprising his role as Mr White from *Casino Royale* and *Quantum of Solace*.[20][21] Christensen's character was reportedly killed off in a scene intended to be used as an epilogue to *Quantum of Solace*, before it was removed from the final cut of the film, enabling his return in *Spectre*.[59]\n\n\nIn addition to the principal cast, Alessandro Cremona was cast as Marco Sciarra, Stephanie Sigman was cast as Estrella, and Detlef Bothe was cast as a villain for scenes shot in Austria.[23][60][61] In February 2015 over 1,500 background artistes were hired for the pre-title sequence set in Mexico, though they were replicated in the film, giving the effect of around 10,000 extras.[62][63][16][64]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAnd while Lea Seydoux doesn't leave a huge impression as this film's 'Bond girl', perhaps it's because we've already met\u2014far too briefly\u2014the hypnotic Monica Bellucci, as the first real 'Bond woman' since Diana Rigg.\"[196] *Chicago Sun-Times* film reviewer Richard Roeper, who gave the film three stars out of four, considered the film \"solidly in the middle of the all-time rankings, which means it's still a slick, beautifully photographed, action-packed, international thriller with a number of wonderfully, ludicrously entertaining set pieces, a sprinkling of dry wit, myriad gorgeous women and a classic psycho-villain who is clearly out of his mind but seems to like it that way.\"[197] Michael Phillips, reviewing for the *Chicago Tribune*, stated, \"For all its workmanlike devotion to out-of-control helicopters, *Spectre* works best when everyone's on the ground, doing his or her job, driving expensive fast cars heedlessly, detonating the occasional wisecrack, \n</fragment>\n</document>",

Craig first proposed killing Bond in 2006, after the premiere of *Casino Royale*; Broccoli agreed to the suggestion. Craig said, \"It's the only way I could see for myself to end it all and to make it like that was my tenure, someone else could come and take over ... When he [Craig's Bond] goes, he can't come back.\"[87] Wilson said it was \"the fitting way to deal with a situation where a person is risking their life all the time. Eventually, the odds catch up with you.\"[87] The production team considered several ways for Bond to die, including being shot by an anonymous shooter. However, Fukunaga said that a \"conventional weapons death\" felt inappropriate considering that Bond had been able to \"escape from everything else\". Craig said the team tried to create a sense of tragedy and weight by using Safin's bioweapon, which killed \"the only thing that Bond wants in life ... to be with the people he loves\".[87]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*No Time to Die* grossed $160.9\u00a0million in the United States and Canada and $613.3\u00a0million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $774.2\u00a0million.[2][3] It was the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2021.[217] Because of the combined production and promotional costs of at least $350\u00a0million, it was estimated that the film would have needed to gross at least $800\u00a0million worldwide in order to break even.[218][219]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n68. **^** Pulver, Andrew (19 February 2019). \"*Bond 25*: More Delays as New Writer Hired to Overhaul Script\". *The Guardian*.
