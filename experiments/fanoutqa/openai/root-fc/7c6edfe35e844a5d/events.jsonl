R. R. Tolkien. The film is the first instalment in *The Lord of the Rings* trilogy. It features an ensemble cast including Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Liv Tyler, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Cate Blanchett, John Rhys-Davies, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan, Orlando Bloom, Christopher Lee, Hugo Weaving, Sean Bean, Ian Holm, and Andy Serkis.\n\n\nSet in Middle-earth, the story tells of the Dark Lord Sauron, who seeks the One Ring, which contains part of his might, to return to power. The Ring has found its way to the young hobbit Frodo Baggins. The fate of Middle-earth hangs in the balance as Frodo and eight companions (who form the Fellowship of the Ring) begin their perilous journey to Mount Doom in the land of Mordor, the only place where the Ring can be destroyed. *The Fellowship of the Ring* was financed and distributed by American studio New Line Cinema, but filmed and edited entirely in Jackson's native New Zealand, concurrently with the other two parts of the trilogy. \n\n\nIt premiered on 10 December 2001 at the Odeon Leicester Square in London, and was then released on 19 December in the United States and on 20 December in New Zealand. The film was acclaimed by critics and fans alike, who considered it to be a landmark in filmmaking and an achievement in the fantasy film genre. It received praise for its visual effects, performances, Jackson's direction, screenplay, musical score, and faithfulness to the source material. It grossed over $880 million worldwide in its initial release, making it the second highest-grossing film of 2001 and the fifth highest-grossing film of all time at the time of its release.[5] Following subsequent reissues, it has as of 2021 grossed over $898 million.[4] Like its successors, *The Fellowship of the Ring* is widely recognized as one of the greatest and most influential films ever made. The film received numerous accolades; at the 74th Academy Awards, it was nominated for thirteen awards, including Best Picture, winning for Best Cinematography, Best Makeup, Best Original Score, and Best Visual Effects.\n\n\nIn 2007, the American Film Institute named it one of the 100 greatest American films in history, being both the most recent film and the only film released in the 21st century to make it to the list. In 2021, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".[6] Two sequels, *The Two Towers* and *The Return of the King*, followed in 2002 and 2003, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn the Second Age of Middle-earth, the lords of Elves, Dwarves, and Men are given Rings of Power. Unbeknownst to them, the Dark Lord Sauron forges the One Ring in Mount Doom, instilling into it a great part of his power, to dominate the other Rings and conquer Middle-earth. A final alliance of Men and Elves battles Sauron's forces in Mordor. Isildur of Gondor severs Sauron's finger and the Ring with it, thereby vanquishing Sauron and returning him to spirit form. With Sauron's first defeat, the Third Age of Middle-earth begins. The Ring's influence corrupts Isildur, who takes it for himself and is later killed by Orcs. The Ring is lost in a river for 2,500 years until it is found by Gollum, who owns it for over four and a half centuries. The ring abandons Gollum and it is subsequently found by a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, who is unaware of its history.\n\n\nSixty years later, Bilbo celebrates his 111th birthday in the Shire, reuniting with his old friend, the wizard Gandalf the Grey. Bilbo departs the Shire for one last adventure, and he leaves his inheritance, including the Ring, to his nephew Frodo. Gandalf investigates the Ring, discovers its true nature, and learns that Gollum was captured and brutally tortured by Sauron's Orcs, revealing two words during his interrogation: \"Shire\" and \"Baggins.\" Gandalf returns and warns Frodo to leave the Shire. As Frodo departs with his friend, gardener Samwise Gamgee, Gandalf rides to Isengard to meet with the wizard Saruman, but discovers his betrayal and alliance with Sauron, who has dispatched his nine undead Nazgûl servants to find Frodo.\n\n\nFrodo and Sam are joined by fellow hobbits Merry and Pippin, and they evade the Nazgûl before arriving in Bree, where they are meant to meet Gandalf at the Inn of The Prancing Pony. However, Gandalf never arrives, having been taken prisoner by Saruman. The hobbits are then aided by a Ranger named Strider, who promises to escort them to Rivendell; however, they are ambushed by the Nazgûl on Weathertop, and their leader, the Witch-King, stabs Frodo with a Morgul blade. Arwen, an Elf and Strider's beloved, locates Strider and rescues Frodo, summoning flood-waters that sweep the Nazgûl away. She takes him to Rivendell, where he is healed by the Elves. Frodo meets with Gandalf, who escaped Isengard on a Great Eagle. That night, Strider reunites with Arwen, and they affirm their love for each other.\n\n\nLearning of Saruman's betrayal from Gandalf and now realizing that they are facing threats from both Sauron and Saruman, Arwen's father, Lord Elrond, decides against keeping the Ring in Rivendell. He holds a council of Elves, Men, and Dwarves, also attended by Frodo and Gandalf, that decides the Ring must be destroyed in the fires of Mount Doom. Frodo volunteers to take the Ring, accompanied by Gandalf, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Elf Legolas, Dwarf Gimli, Boromir of Gondor, and Strider—who is actually Aragorn, Isildur's heir and the rightful King of Gondor. Bilbo, now living in Rivendell, gives Frodo his sword Sting, and a chainmail shirt made of *mithril*.\n\n\nThe Fellowship of the Ring makes for the Gap of Rohan, but discover it is being watched by Saruman's spies. They instead set off over the mountain pass of Caradhras, but Saruman summons a storm that forces them to travel through the Mines of Moria, where a tentacled water beast blocks off the entrance with the Fellowship inside, giving them no choice but to journey to the exit on the other end. After finding the Dwarves of Moria dead, the Fellowship is attacked by Orcs and a cave troll. They hold them off but are confronted by Durin's Bane: a Balrog residing within the mines. While the others escape, Gandalf fends off the Balrog and casts it into a vast chasm, but the Balrog drags Gandalf down into the darkness with him. The devastated Fellowship reaches Lothlórien, ruled by the Elf-queen Galadriel, who privately informs Frodo that only he can complete the quest and that one of the Fellowship will try to take the Ring. She also shows him a vision of the future in which Sauron succeeds in enslaving Middle-earth, including the Shire. Meanwhile, Saruman creates an army of Uruk-hai in Isengard to find and kill the Fellowship.\n\n\nThe Fellowship travels by river to Parth Galen. Frodo wanders off and is confronted by Boromir, who, as Lady Galadriel had warned, tries to take the Ring. Uruk-hai scouts then ambush the Fellowship, attempting to abduct the Hobbits. Boromir breaks free of the Ring's magic and protects Merry and Pippin, but the Uruk-Hai leader, Lurtz, mortally wounds Boromir as they abduct the Hobbits. Aragorn arrives and kills Lurtz before comforting Boromir as he dies, promising to help the people of Gondor in the coming conflict. Fearing the Ring will corrupt his friends, Frodo decides to travel to Mordor alone, but allows Sam to come along, recalling his promise to Gandalf to look after him. As Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli set out to rescue Merry and Pippin, Frodo and Sam make their way down the mountain pass of Emyn Muil, journeying on to Mordor. \n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Cast of *The Lord of the Rings* film series\n\n![](image)The eponymous Fellowship from left to right: (Top row) Aragorn, Gandalf, Legolas, Boromir, (bottom row) Sam, Frodo, Merry, Pippin, Gimli\nBefore filming began on 11 October 1999, the principal actors trained for six weeks in sword fighting (with Bob Anderson), riding and boating. Jackson hoped such activities would allow the cast to bond so chemistry would be evident on screen as well as getting them used to life in Wellington.[7] They were also trained to pronounce Tolkien's verses properly.[8] After the shoot, the nine cast members playing the Fellowship got a tattoo, the Elvish symbol for the number nine, with the exception of John Rhys-Davies, whose stunt double got the tattoo instead.[9] The film is noted for having an ensemble cast,[10] and some of the cast and their respective characters include:\n\n\n\n* Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins: A young hobbit who inherits the One Ring from his uncle Bilbo. Wood was the first actor to be cast on 7 July 1999.[11] Wood was a fan of the book, and he sent in an audition dressed as Frodo, reading lines from the novel.[12] Wood was selected from 150 actors who auditioned.[13] Jake Gyllenhaal unsuccessfully auditioned for the role.[14]\n* Ian McKellen as Gandalf the Grey: An Istari wizard and mentor to Frodo. Sean Connery was approached for the role, but did not understand the plot,[12] while Patrick Stewart turned it down as he disliked the script.[15] Patrick McGoohan was also offered the role, but turned it down due to health issues.[16] Anthony Hopkins and Christopher Plummer also turned down the role.[17][18] Richard Harris expressed interest in the part.[19] John Astin auditioned for Gandalf.[20] Sam Neill was also offered the role but declined due to his scheduling conflict with *Jurassic Park III*. Before being cast, McKellen had to sort his schedule with 20th Century Fox as there was a two-month overlap with *X-Men*.[13] He enjoyed playing Gandalf the Grey more than his transformed state in the next two films,[9] and based his accent on Tolkien. Unlike his on-screen character, McKellen did not spend much time with the actors playing the Hobbits; instead he worked with their scale doubles.[7]\n* Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn: A Dúnedain ranger and heir to Gondor's throne. Daniel Day-Lewis was offered the part at the beginning of pre-production, but turned it down.[21] Nicolas Cage also received an offer, declining because of \"family obligations\",[22] while Vin Diesel, a fan of the book, auditioned for Aragorn.[*citation needed*] Stuart Townsend was cast in the role, before being replaced during filming when Jackson realised he was too young.[12] Russell Crowe was considered as a replacement, but he turned it down because he does not want to be typecast and believed it to be a similar role in *Gladiator*.[12] Day-Lewis was offered the role for a second time, but declined again.[21] Executive producer Mark Ordesky saw Mortensen in a play. Mortensen's son, a fan of the book, convinced him to take the role.[7] Mortensen read the book on the plane, received a crash course lesson in fencing from Bob Anderson and began filming the scenes on Weathertop.[23] Mortensen became a hit with the crew by patching up his costume[24] and carrying his \"hero\" sword around with him off-camera.[7]\n* Sean Astin as Samwise Gamgee: Better known as Sam, a hobbit gardener and Frodo's best friend. Astin, who had recently become a father, bonded with the 18-year-old Wood in a protective manner, which mirrored Sam's relationship with Frodo.[7] before Astin was cast, James Corden read for the part.[25]\n* Sean Bean as Boromir: A son of the Stewards of Gondor who journeys with the Fellowship towards Mordor. Bruce Willis, a fan of the book, expressed interest in the role, while Liam Neeson was sent the script, but passed.[12]\n* Billy Boyd as Peregrin Took: Better known as Pippin, an extremely foolish hobbit who is a distant cousin of Frodo and travels with the Fellowship on their journey to Mordor.\n* Dominic Monaghan as Meriadoc Brandybuck: Better known as Merry, a distant cousin of Frodo. Monaghan was cast as Merry after auditioning for Frodo.[12]\n* John Rhys-Davies as Gimli: A dwarf warrior who accompanies the Fellowship to Mordor after they set out from Rivendell. Billy Connolly, who was considered for the part of Gimli, would later portray Dáin II Ironfoot in Peter Jackson's *The Hobbit* film trilogy.[12] Rhys-Davies wore heavy prosthetics to play Gimli, which limited his vision, and eventually he developed eczema around his eyes.[7] Rhys-Davies also played Gimli's father Glóin during the scene where the fellowship is forged.\n* Orlando Bloom as Legolas: A prince of the elves' Woodland Realm and a skilled archer. Bloom initially auditioned for Faramir, who appears in the second film, a role which went to David Wenham.[12]\n* Liv Tyler as Arwen: An elf of Rivendell and Aragorn's lover. The filmmakers approached Tyler after seeing her performance in *Plunkett & Macleane*, and New Line Cinema leaped at the opportunity of having one Hollywood star in the film. Actress Helena Bonham Carter had expressed interest in the role.[12] Tyler came to shoot on short occasions, unlike the rest of the actors. She was one of the last actors to be cast, on 25 August 1999.[26]\n* Cate Blanchett as Galadriel: The elven co-ruler of Lothlórien alongside her husband Celeborn. Lucy Lawless was considered for the role.[27]\n* Christopher Lee as Saruman the White: The fallen head of the Istari Order who succumbs to Sauron's will through his use of the *palantír*. Lee was a major fan of the book, and read it once a year. He had also met J. R. R. Tolkien.[23] He originally auditioned for Gandalf, but was judged too old.[12]\n* Hugo Weaving as Elrond: The Elven-Lord of Rivendell who leads the Council of Elrond, which ultimately decides to destroy the Ring. David Bowie expressed interest in the role, but Jackson stated, \"To have a famous, beloved character and a famous star colliding is slightly uncomfortable.\"[13]\n* Ian Holm as Bilbo Baggins: Frodo's uncle who gives him the Ring after he decides to retire to Rivendell. Holm previously played Frodo in a 1981 radio adaption of *The Lord of the Rings*, and was cast as Bilbo after Jackson remembered his performance.[12] Sylvester McCoy, who would later play Radagast the Brown in *The Hobbit*, was contacted about playing the role, and was kept in place as a potential Bilbo for six months before Jackson went with Holm.[28]\n* Andy Serkis as Gollum (voice/motion-capture): A wretched hobbit-like creature whose mind was poisoned by the Ring after bearing it for 500 years. This character appears briefly in the prologue. In Mordor, one can only hear his voice shouting and in Moria, only his eyes and his nose appear. Serkis was working on the 1999 six-episode *Oliver Twist* miniseries when his agent told him that Jackson wanted to approach him to play Gollum. Despite ultimately accepting the role, Serkis was initially doubtful about taking the part as one of his *Oliver Twist* fellow actors opined that it wasn't a good idea if his face wasn't going to appear onscreen, aside that Jackson was unsure if Gollum could be portrayed with motion-capture performance as they wished.[29]\n\n\nThe cast also includes:[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n* Sala Baker as Sauron:[30] The Dark Lord of Mordor and the Ring's true master, who manifests as an Eye after the destruction of his physical form.\n* Marton Csokas as Celeborn the Wise: The Elven-Lord of Lothlórien and Galadriel's husband.\n* Lawrence Makoare as Lurtz: The commander of Saruman's Uruk-Hai forces.\n* Craig Parker as Haldir: The leader of the Galadhrim warriors guarding the border of Lothlórien.\n* Mark Ferguson as Ereinion Gil-galad: The last Elven-King of the Noldor.\n* Peter McKenzie as Elendil the Tall: The last High King of Arnor and Gondor.\n* Harry Sinclair as Isildur: Elendil's son and Aragorn's ancestor who originally defeated Sauron.\n* Director Peter Jackson has a small cameo as a man with a carrot in Bree.\n\n\n## Comparison to the source material[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Peter Jackson's interpretation of The Lord of the Rings\n\nJackson, Walsh and Boyens made numerous changes to the story, for purposes of pacing and character development. Jackson said his main desire was to make a film focused primarily on Frodo and the Ring, the \"backbone\" of the story.[31] The prologue condenses Tolkien's backstory, in which The Last Alliance's seven-year siege of the Barad-dûr is a single battle, where Sauron is shown to explode, though Tolkien only said his spirit flees.[32]\n\n\nSome events and characters from the book are condensed or omitted (such is the case of Tom Bombadil) at the beginning of the film. The time between Gandalf leaving the Ring to Frodo and returning to reveal its inscription, which is 17 years in the book, is compressed for timing reasons.[33] The filmmakers also decided to move the opening scenes of *The Two Towers*, the Uruk-hai ambush and Boromir's death, to the film's linear climax.[31][33]\n\n\nThe tone of the Moria sequence was altered. In the book, following the defeat on the Caradhras road, Gandalf advocates the Moria road against the resistance of the rest of the Fellowship (save Gimli), suggesting \"there is a hope that Moria is still free...there is even a chance that Dwarves are there,\" though no one seems to think this likely. Frodo proposes they take a company vote, but the discovery of Wargs on their trail forces them to accept Gandalf's proposal. They only realize the Dwarves are all dead once they reach Balin's tomb. The filmmakers chose instead for Gandalf to resist the Moria plan as a foreshadowing device. Gandalf says to Gimli he would prefer not to enter Moria, and Saruman is shown to be aware of Gandalf's hesitance, revealing an illustration of the Balrog in one of his books. The corpses of the dwarves are instantly shown as the Fellowship enter Moria.[34] One detail that many critics commented upon is that, in the novel, Pippin tosses a mere pebble into the well in Moria (\"They then hear what sounds like a hammer tapping in the distance\"), whereas in the film, he knocks an entire skeleton in (\"Next, the skeleton ... falls down the well, also dragging down a chain and bucket. The noise is incredible.\").[35][36][37][38][39]\n\n\nWhen Frodo is struck by a Nazgûl at Weathertop, in the book, the elf Glorfindel rides him to Rivendell, whereas in the film, Arwen takes on this role.\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Production of *The Lord of the Rings* film series\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\nDirector Peter Jackson began working with Christian Rivers to storyboard the series in August 1997, as well as getting Richard Taylor and Weta Workshop to begin creating his interpretation of Middle-earth.[40] Jackson told them to make Middle-earth as plausible and believable as possible, and to think of it in a historical manner.[41]\n\n\nIn November,[41] Alan Lee and John Howe became the film trilogy's primary conceptual designers, having had previous experience as illustrators for the book and various other tie-ins. Lee worked for the Art Department creating places such as Rivendell, Isengard, Moria, and Lothlórien, giving Art Nouveau and geometry influences to the Elves and Dwarves respectively.[41][42] Though Howe contributed with Bag End and the Argonath,[41][42] he focused on the design of the characters' armour, having studied it his entire life.[43] Weta and the Art Department continued to design, with Grant Major turning the Art Department's designs into architecture, and Dan Hennah scouting locations.[41] On 1 April 1999, Ngila Dickson joined the crew as costume designer. She and 40 seamstresses would create 19,000 costumes, 40 per version for the actor and their doubles, wearing them out for an impression of age.[24]\n\n\n\n### Filming locations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Arwen faces the Nazgûl at the Fords of Bruinen (Arrow River)\nFilming took place in various locations across New Zealand. A list of filming locations, sorted by appearance order in the film:[44][45]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Fictionallocation\n | Specific locationin New Zealand\n | General areain New Zealand\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Mordor (Prologue) | Whakapapa skifield | Tongariro National Park |\n| Hobbiton | Matamata | Waikato |\n| Gardens of Isengard | Harcourt Park | Upper Hutt |\n| The Shire woods | Otaki Gorge Road | Kāpiti Coast District |\n| Bucklebury Ferry | Keeling Farm, Manakau | Horowhenua |\n| Forest near Bree | Takaka Hill | Nelson |\n| Trollshaws | Waitarere Forest | Horowhenua |\n| Flight to the Ford | Tarras | Central Otago |\n| Ford of Bruinen | Arrow River, Skippers Canyon | Queenstown and Arrowtown |\n| Rivendell | Kaitoke Regional Park | Upper Hutt |\n| Eregion | Mount Olympus | Nelson\n |\n| Dead Marshes | Kepler Mire | Southland |\n| Dimrill Dale | Lake Alta | The Remarkables |\n| Dimrill Dale | Mount Owen | Nelson\n |\n| Lothlórien | Paradise | Glenorchy |\n| River Anduin | Upper Waiau River | Fiordland National Park |\n| River Anduin | Rangitikei River | Rangitikei District |\n| River Anduin | Poets' Corner | Upper Hutt\n |\n| Parth Galen | Paradise | Glenorchy\n |\n| Amon Hen | Mavora Lakes, Paradise and Closeburn | Southern Lakes |\n\n\n### Special effects[edit]\n\n\n*The Fellowship of the Ring* makes extensive use of digital, practical and make-up special effects. One notable illusion used in almost every scene involved setting a proper scale so that the characters all appear to be the correct height. For example, Elijah Wood is 5 feet 6 inches (1.68 m) tall in real life, but his character, Frodo Baggins, is barely four feet in height. A variety of techniques were used to depict the hobbits and Gimli the Dwarf as being of diminutive stature. Fortunately, John-Rhys Davies – who played Gimli – happens to be the correct height in proportion to the hobbit actors, so did not need to be filmed separately as a third height variation. Large- and small-scale doubles were used in certain scenes, while entire duplicates of certain sets (including Bag End in Hobbiton) were built at two different scales, so that the characters would appear to be the appropriate size. At one point in the film, Frodo runs along a corridor in Bag End, followed by Gandalf. Elijah Wood and Ian McKellen were filmed in separate versions of the same corridor, built at two different scales, and a fast camera pan conceals the edit between the two. Forced perspective was also employed, so that it would look as though the short hobbits were interacting with taller Men and Elves. Even the simple use of kneeling down, to the filmmakers' surprise, turned out to be an effective method in creating the illusion.\n\n\nFor the battle between the Last Alliance and Sauron's forces that begins the film, an elaborate CGI animation system, called MASSIVE, was developed by Stephen Regelous; it allowed thousands of individual animated characters, or \"agents\" in the program, to act independently. This lent the illusion of realism to the battle sequences. The \"Making of\" Lord of the Rings DVD reports some interesting initial problems: for instance, in the first execution of a battle between groups of characters, the wrong groups attacked each other. In another early demo, some of the warriors at the edge of the field could be seen running away. They were initially moving in the wrong direction, and had been programmed to keep running until they encountered an enemy.\n\n\nThe digital creatures were important due to Jackson's requirement of biological plausibility. Their surface texture was scanned from large maquettes before numerous digital details of their skeletons and muscles were added. In the case of the Balrog, Gray Horsfield created a system that copied recorded imagery of fire.\n\n\n\n### Score[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring* (soundtrack)\n\nFor broader coverage of this topic, see Music of *The Lord of the Rings* film series.\n\nJames Horner turned down the offer to compose the score.[46] The musical score for *The Lord of the Rings* films was composed by Howard Shore. It was performed by the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, the London Philharmonic Orchestra, the London Voices, The London Oratory School Schola, and the Maori Samoan Choir, and featured several vocal soloists. Shore wrote almost four hours of finalized music for the film (of which just over three hours are used as underscore), featuring a number of non-orchestral instruments, and a large number (49–62) of leitmotives.\n\n\nTwo original songs, \"Aníron\" and the end title theme \"May It Be\", were composed and sung by Enya, who allowed her label, Reprise Records, to release the soundtrack to *The Fellowship of the Ring* and its two sequels. In addition to these, Shore composed \"In Dreams\", which was sung by Edward Ross of the London Oratory School Schola.\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\nThe world premiere of *The Fellowship of the Ring* was held at the Odeon Leicester Square in London on 10 December 2001. It was released on Wednesday, 19 December 2001 internationally in most major territories on 10,000 screens.[47] It opened in New Zealand on 20 December.\n\n\n\n### Marketing[edit]\n\n\nA special featurette trailer was released in 2000. The trilogy sizzle reel was shown before *Thirteen Days* and the teaser trailer before *Pearl Harbor*. The theatrical trailer was attached with the television premiere of *Angel* and before *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*. Both trailers appeared as Easter eggs on the *Rush Hour 2* and *Little Nicky* home video releases.\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n*The Fellowship of the Ring* was released on VHS and DVD on 6 August 2002.[48] It was the best-selling DVD release at the time with 14.5 million copies being sold. This record was dethroned by *Finding Nemo* the following year.[49]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Theatrical and extended release[edit]\n\n\nOn 12 November 2002, an extended edition was released on VHS and DVD, with 30 minutes of new material, added special effects and music, plus 19 minutes of fan-club credits, totaling to 228 minutes.[50][51][52] The DVD set included four commentaries and over three hours of supplementary material.\n\n\nOn 29 August 2006, a limited edition of *The Fellowship of the Ring* was released on DVD. The set included both the film's theatrical and extended editions on a double-sided disc along with all-new bonus material.\n\n\n\n#### Blu-ray edition[edit]\n\n\nThe theatrical Blu-ray version of *The Lord of the Rings* was released in the United States on 6 April 2010. There were two separate sets: one with digital copies and one without.[53] The individual Blu-ray disc of *The Fellowship of the Ring* was released on 14 September 2010 with the same special features as the complete trilogy release, except there was no digital copy.[54]\n\n\nThe extended Blu-ray editions were released in the US on 28 June 2011.[55] This version has a runtime of 238 minutes[51][56] (the extended editions include the names of all fan club members at the time of their release; the additional 10 minutes in the Blu-ray version are because of expanded member rolls, not any additional story material).\n\n\n*The Fellowship of the Ring* was released in Ultra HD Blu-ray on 30 November 2020 in the United Kingdom and on 1 December 2020 in the United States, along with the other films of the trilogy, including both the theatrical and the extended editions of the films.[57]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\nOn its opening day, it grossed $18.2 million in the United States and Canada from 3,359 cinemas and $11.5 million in 13 countries, including $3 million from 466 screens in the United Kingdom.[3][58] It grossed $75.1 million in its first five days in the United States and Canada, including $47.2 million on its opening weekend, placing it at number one at the US box office, setting a December opening record, beating *Ocean's Eleven*.[59][3]\n\n\nThe film also opened at number one in 29 international markets and remained there for a second week in all but the Netherlands. It set a record opening day gross in Australia with $2.09 million from 405 screens, beating the record $1.3 million set by *Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace*. It had a record opening weekend in Germany with 1.5 million admissions and in Spain with a gross of $5.3 million from 395 screens. It also grossed a record $2.5 million in 15 days in New Zealand.[60] This record would last for less than a decade before being surpassed by *Avatar*.[61] In its first 15 days, it had grossed $183.5 million internationally and $178.7 million in the United States and Canada for a worldwide total of $362.2 million.[60][3]\n\n\nIn its initial release, it went on to gross $313.4 million in the United States and Canada and $547.2 million in the rest of the world for a worldwide total of $860.5 million.[5] Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 54 million tickets in the US and Canada in its initial theatrical run.[62] Following subsequent reissues, the film has grossed $316.1 million in the United States and Canada and $582.1 million in the rest of the world for a worldwide total of $898.2 million.[3]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Differences between *The Lord of the Rings* book and film series\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 91% based on 235 reviews, with an average rating of 8.20/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"Full of eye-popping special effects, and featuring a pitch-perfect cast, *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring* brings J.R.R. Tolkien's classic to vivid life.\"[63] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 92 out of 100 based on 34 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[64] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale.[65]\n\n\n*The Fellowship of the Ring* was released to universal critical acclaim. Colin Kennedy for *Empire* gave the film five stars out of five, writing \"Brooking no argument, history should quickly regard Peter Jackson’s *The Fellowship of the Ring* as the first instalment of the best fantasy epic in motion picture history... Putting formula blockbusters to shame, *Fellowship* is impeccably cast and constructed with both care and passion: this is a labour of love that never feels laboured. Emotional range and character depth ultimately take us beyond genre limitations...\"[66] Roger Ebert of the *Chicago Sun-Times* gave the film three out of four stars and stating that while it is not \"a true visualization of Tolkien's Middle-earth\", it is \"a work for, and of, our times. It will be embraced, I suspect, by many Tolkien fans and take on aspects of a cult. It is a candidate for many Oscars. It is an awesome production in its daring and breadth, and there are small touches that are just right\".[67] *USA Today* also gave the film three out of four stars and wrote, \"this movie version of a beloved book should please devotees as well as the uninitiated\".[68] In his review for *The New York Times*, Elvis Mitchell wrote, \"The playful spookiness of Mr. Jackson's direction provides a lively, light touch, a gesture that doesn't normally come to mind when Tolkien's name is mentioned\".[69] Lisa Schwarzbaum for *Entertainment Weekly* gave the film an A grade and wrote \"The cast take to their roles with becoming modesty, certainly, but Jackson also makes it easy for them: His *Fellowship* flows, never lingering for the sake of admiring its own beauty ... Every detail of which engrossed me. I may have never turned a page of Tolkien, but I know enchantment when I see it\".[70] In his review for the BBC, Nev Pierce gave the film four stars out of five, describing it as \"Funny, scary, and totally involving\", and wrote that Jackson turned \"the book's least screen-worthy volume into a gripping and powerful adventure movie\".[71] In his review for *The Guardian*, Xan Brooks wrote \"Rather than a stand-alone holiday blockbuster, *The Fellowship of the Ring* offers an epic act one\", and commented that the ending was \"closer in spirit to an art-house film than a popcorn holiday romp\".[72]\n\n\nIn his review for the *New York Post*, Lou Lumenick gave the film four stars out of four, praising Jackson's direction, the casting, the sets, and the score, and describing the film as \"the three most exciting hours we've seen on a movie screen in years\" and \"easily one of the year's best movies\".[73] In her review for *The Washington Post*, Rita Kempley gave the film five stars out of five, and praised the cast, in particular, \"Mortensen, as Strider, is a revelation, not to mention downright gorgeous. And McKellen, carrying the burden of thousands of years' worth of the fight against evil, is positively Merlinesque\".[74] *Time* magazine's Richard Corliss praised Jackson's work: \"His movie achieves what the best fairy tales do: the creation of an alternate world, plausible and persuasive, where the young — and not only the young — can lose themselves. And perhaps, in identifying with the little Hobbit that could, find their better selves\".[75] In his review for *The Village Voice*, J. Hoberman wrote, \"Peter Jackson's adaptation is certainly successful on its own terms\".[76] *Rolling Stone* magazine's Peter Travers wrote, \"It's emotion that makes *Fellowship* stick hard in the memory... Jackson deserves to revel in his success. He's made a three-hour film that leaves you wanting more\".[77] A mixed review was written by Peter Bradshaw. Writing for *The Guardian*, he lauded the art direction and the visual look of the film, but he also commented \"there is a strange paucity of plot complication, an absence of anything unfolding, all the more disconcerting because of the clotted and indigestible mythic back story that we have to wade through before anything happens at all\". Overall, Bradshaw found the tone of the film too serious and self-important, and wrote \"signing up to the movie's whole hobbity-elvish universe requires a leap of faith... It's a leap I didn't feel much like making – and, with two more movie episodes like this on the way, the credibility gap looks wider than ever.\"[78] Jonathan Rosenbaum was also less positive about *The Fellowship of the Ring*: in his review for the *Chicago Reader*, he granted that the film was \"full of scenic splendors with a fine sense of scale\", but he commented that its narrative thrust seemed \"relatively pro forma\", and that he found the battle scenes boring.[79]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by *The Lord of the Rings* film series\n\nIn 2002, the film won four Academy Awards from thirteen nominations.[80] The winning categories were for Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, Best Makeup, and Best Original Score. It was also nominated for Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Ian McKellen), Best Art Direction, Best Director, Best Film Editing, Best Original Song (Enya, Nicky Ryan and Roma Ryan for \"May It Be\"), Best Picture, Best Sound (Christopher Boyes, Michael Semanick, Gethin Creagh and Hammond Peek), Best Costume Design and Best Adapted Screenplay.\n\n\nThe film won the 2002 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation. It also won *Empire* readers' Best Film award, as well as five BAFTAs, including Best Film, the David Lean Award for Best Direction, the Audience Award (voted for by the public), Best Special Effects, and Best Make-up. The film was nominated for an MTV Movie Award for Best Fight between Gandalf and Saruman.\n\n\nIn June 2008, AFI revealed its \"10 Top 10\"—the ten best films in ten \"classic\" American film genres—after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community. *The Fellowship of the Ring* was acknowledged as the second best film in the fantasy genre.[81][82] The film was also listed as the 50th best film in the 2007 list AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition).\n\n\n\n\n\n| Award\n | Category\n | Recipient/Nominee\n | Result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Academy Awards | Best Picture | Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh and Barrie M.

R. R. Tolkien. The film is the first instalment in *The Lord of the Rings* trilogy. It features an ensemble cast including Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Liv Tyler, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Cate Blanchett, John Rhys-Davies, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan, Orlando Bloom, Christopher Lee, Hugo Weaving, Sean Bean, Ian Holm, and Andy Serkis.\n\n\nSet in Middle-earth, the story tells of the Dark Lord Sauron, who seeks the One Ring, which contains part of his might, to return to power. The Ring has found its way to the young hobbit Frodo Baggins. The fate of Middle-earth hangs in the balance as Frodo and eight companions (who form the Fellowship of the Ring) begin their perilous journey to Mount Doom in the land of Mordor, the only place where the Ring can be destroyed. *The Fellowship of the Ring* was financed and distributed by American studio New Line Cinema, but filmed and edited entirely in Jackson's native New Zealand, concurrently with the other two parts of the trilogy. \n\n\nIt premiered on 10 December 2001 at the Odeon Leicester Square in London, and was then released on 19 December in the United States and on 20 December in New Zealand. The film was acclaimed by critics and fans alike, who considered it to be a landmark in filmmaking and an achievement in the fantasy film genre. It received praise for its visual effects, performances, Jackson's direction, screenplay, musical score, and faithfulness to the source material. It grossed over $880 million worldwide in its initial release, making it the second highest-grossing film of 2001 and the fifth highest-grossing film of all time at the time of its release.[5] Following subsequent reissues, it has as of 2021 grossed over $898 million.[4] Like its successors, *The Fellowship of the Ring* is widely recognized as one of the greatest and most influential films ever made. The film received numerous accolades; at the 74th Academy Awards, it was nominated for thirteen awards, including Best Picture, winning for Best Cinematography, Best Makeup, Best Original Score, and Best Visual Effects.\n\n\nIn 2007, the American Film Institute named it one of the 100 greatest American films in history, being both the most recent film and the only film released in the 21st century to make it to the list. In 2021, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".[6] Two sequels, *The Two Towers* and *The Return of the King*, followed in 2002 and 2003, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn the Second Age of Middle-earth, the lords of Elves, Dwarves, and Men are given Rings of Power. Unbeknownst to them, the Dark Lord Sauron forges the One Ring in Mount Doom, instilling into it a great part of his power, to dominate the other Rings and conquer Middle-earth. A final alliance of Men and Elves battles Sauron's forces in Mordor. Isildur of Gondor severs Sauron's finger and the Ring with it, thereby vanquishing Sauron and returning him to spirit form. With Sauron's first defeat, the Third Age of Middle-earth begins. The Ring's influence corrupts Isildur, who takes it for himself and is later killed by Orcs. The Ring is lost in a river for 2,500 years until it is found by Gollum, who owns it for over four and a half centuries. The ring abandons Gollum and it is subsequently found by a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, who is unaware of its history.\n\n\nSixty years later, Bilbo celebrates his 111th birthday in the Shire, reuniting with his old friend, the wizard Gandalf the Grey. Bilbo departs the Shire for one last adventure, and he leaves his inheritance, including the Ring, to his nephew Frodo. Gandalf investigates the Ring, discovers its true nature, and learns that Gollum was captured and brutally tortured by Sauron's Orcs, revealing two words during his interrogation: \"Shire\" and \"Baggins.\" Gandalf returns and warns Frodo to leave the Shire. As Frodo departs with his friend, gardener Samwise Gamgee, Gandalf rides to Isengard to meet with the wizard Saruman, but discovers his betrayal and alliance with Sauron, who has dispatched his nine undead Nazgûl servants to find Frodo.\n\n\nFrodo and Sam are joined by fellow hobbits Merry and Pippin, and they evade the Nazgûl before arriving in Bree, where they are meant to meet Gandalf at the Inn of The Prancing Pony. However, Gandalf never arrives, having been taken prisoner by Saruman. The hobbits are then aided by a Ranger named Strider, who promises to escort them to Rivendell; however, they are ambushed by the Nazgûl on Weathertop, and their leader, the Witch-King, stabs Frodo with a Morgul blade. Arwen, an Elf and Strider's beloved, locates Strider and rescues Frodo, summoning flood-waters that sweep the Nazgûl away. She takes him to Rivendell, where he is healed by the Elves. Frodo meets with Gandalf, who escaped Isengard on a Great Eagle. That night, Strider reunites with Arwen, and they affirm their love for each other.\n\n\nLearning of Saruman's betrayal from Gandalf and now realizing that they are facing threats from both Sauron and Saruman, Arwen's father, Lord Elrond, decides against keeping the Ring in Rivendell. He holds a council of Elves, Men, and Dwarves, also attended by Frodo and Gandalf, that decides the Ring must be destroyed in the fires of Mount Doom. Frodo volunteers to take the Ring, accompanied by Gandalf, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Elf Legolas, Dwarf Gimli, Boromir of Gondor, and Strider—who is actually Aragorn, Isildur's heir and the rightful King of Gondor. Bilbo, now living in Rivendell, gives Frodo his sword Sting, and a chainmail shirt made of *mithril*.\n\n\nThe Fellowship of the Ring makes for the Gap of Rohan, but discover it is being watched by Saruman's spies. They instead set off over the mountain pass of Caradhras, but Saruman summons a storm that forces them to travel through the Mines of Moria, where a tentacled water beast blocks off the entrance with the Fellowship inside, giving them no choice but to journey to the exit on the other end. After finding the Dwarves of Moria dead, the Fellowship is attacked by Orcs and a cave troll. They hold them off but are confronted by Durin's Bane: a Balrog residing within the mines. While the others escape, Gandalf fends off the Balrog and casts it into a vast chasm, but the Balrog drags Gandalf down into the darkness with him. The devastated Fellowship reaches Lothlórien, ruled by the Elf-queen Galadriel, who privately informs Frodo that only he can complete the quest and that one of the Fellowship will try to take the Ring. She also shows him a vision of the future in which Sauron succeeds in enslaving Middle-earth, including the Shire. Meanwhile, Saruman creates an army of Uruk-hai in Isengard to find and kill the Fellowship.\n\n\nThe Fellowship travels by river to Parth Galen. Frodo wanders off and is confronted by Boromir, who, as Lady Galadriel had warned, tries to take the Ring. Uruk-hai scouts then ambush the Fellowship, attempting to abduct the Hobbits. Boromir breaks free of the Ring's magic and protects Merry and Pippin, but the Uruk-Hai leader, Lurtz, mortally wounds Boromir as they abduct the Hobbits. Aragorn arrives and kills Lurtz before comforting Boromir as he dies, promising to help the people of Gondor in the coming conflict. Fearing the Ring will corrupt his friends, Frodo decides to travel to Mordor alone, but allows Sam to come along, recalling his promise to Gandalf to look after him. As Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli set out to rescue Merry and Pippin, Frodo and Sam make their way down the mountain pass of Emyn Muil, journeying on to Mordor. \n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Cast of *The Lord of the Rings* film series\n\n![](image)The eponymous Fellowship from left to right: (Top row) Aragorn, Gandalf, Legolas, Boromir, (bottom row) Sam, Frodo, Merry, Pippin, Gimli\nBefore filming began on 11 October 1999, the principal actors trained for six weeks in sword fighting (with Bob Anderson), riding and boating. Jackson hoped such activities would allow the cast to bond so chemistry would be evident on screen as well as getting them used to life in Wellington.[7] They were also trained to pronounce Tolkien's verses properly.[8] After the shoot, the nine cast members playing the Fellowship got a tattoo, the Elvish symbol for the number nine, with the exception of John Rhys-Davies, whose stunt double got the tattoo instead.[9] The film is noted for having an ensemble cast,[10] and some of the cast and their respective characters include:\n\n\n\n* Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins: A young hobbit who inherits the One Ring from his uncle Bilbo. Wood was the first actor to be cast on 7 July 1999.[11] Wood was a fan of the book, and he sent in an audition dressed as Frodo, reading lines from the novel.[12] Wood was selected from 150 actors who auditioned.[13] Jake Gyllenhaal unsuccessfully auditioned for the role.[14]\n* Ian McKellen as Gandalf the Grey: An Istari wizard and mentor to Frodo. Sean Connery was approached for the role, but did not understand the plot,[12] while Patrick Stewart turned it down as he disliked the script.[15] Patrick McGoohan was also offered the role, but turned it down due to health issues.[16] Anthony Hopkins and Christopher Plummer also turned down the role.[17][18] Richard Harris expressed interest in the part.[19] John Astin auditioned for Gandalf.[20] Sam Neill was also offered the role but declined due to his scheduling conflict with *Jurassic Park III*. Before being cast, McKellen had to sort his schedule with 20th Century Fox as there was a two-month overlap with *X-Men*.[13] He enjoyed playing Gandalf the Grey more than his transformed state in the next two films,[9] and based his accent on Tolkien. Unlike his on-screen character, McKellen did not spend much time with the actors playing the Hobbits; instead he worked with their scale doubles.[7]\n* Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn: A Dúnedain ranger and heir to Gondor's throne. Daniel Day-Lewis was offered the part at the beginning of pre-production, but turned it down.[21] Nicolas Cage also received an offer, declining because of \"family obligations\",[22] while Vin Diesel, a fan of the book, auditioned for Aragorn.[*citation needed*] Stuart Townsend was cast in the role, before being replaced during filming when Jackson realised he was too young.[12] Russell Crowe was considered as a replacement, but he turned it down because he does not want to be typecast and believed it to be a similar role in *Gladiator*.[12] Day-Lewis was offered the role for a second time, but declined again.[21] Executive producer Mark Ordesky saw Mortensen in a play. Mortensen's son, a fan of the book, convinced him to take the role.[7] Mortensen read the book on the plane, received a crash course lesson in fencing from Bob Anderson and began filming the scenes on Weathertop.[23] Mortensen became a hit with the crew by patching up his costume[24] and carrying his \"hero\" sword around with him off-camera.[7]\n* Sean Astin as Samwise Gamgee: Better known as Sam, a hobbit gardener and Frodo's best friend. Astin, who had recently become a father, bonded with the 18-year-old Wood in a protective manner, which mirrored Sam's relationship with Frodo.[7] before Astin was cast, James Corden read for the part.[25]\n* Sean Bean as Boromir: A son of the Stewards of Gondor who journeys with the Fellowship towards Mordor. Bruce Willis, a fan of the book, expressed interest in the role, while Liam Neeson was sent the script, but passed.[12]\n* Billy Boyd as Peregrin Took: Better known as Pippin, an extremely foolish hobbit who is a distant cousin of Frodo and travels with the Fellowship on their journey to Mordor.\n* Dominic Monaghan as Meriadoc Brandybuck: Better known as Merry, a distant cousin of Frodo. Monaghan was cast as Merry after auditioning for Frodo.[12]\n* John Rhys-Davies as Gimli: A dwarf warrior who accompanies the Fellowship to Mordor after they set out from Rivendell. Billy Connolly, who was considered for the part of Gimli, would later portray Dáin II Ironfoot in Peter Jackson's *The Hobbit* film trilogy.[12] Rhys-Davies wore heavy prosthetics to play Gimli, which limited his vision, and eventually he developed eczema around his eyes.[7] Rhys-Davies also played Gimli's father Glóin during the scene where the fellowship is forged.\n* Orlando Bloom as Legolas: A prince of the elves' Woodland Realm and a skilled archer. Bloom initially auditioned for Faramir, who appears in the second film, a role which went to David Wenham.[12]\n* Liv Tyler as Arwen: An elf of Rivendell and Aragorn's lover. The filmmakers approached Tyler after seeing her performance in *Plunkett & Macleane*, and New Line Cinema leaped at the opportunity of having one Hollywood star in the film. Actress Helena Bonham Carter had expressed interest in the role.[12] Tyler came to shoot on short occasions, unlike the rest of the actors. She was one of the last actors to be cast, on 25 August 1999.[26]\n* Cate Blanchett as Galadriel: The elven co-ruler of Lothlórien alongside her husband Celeborn. Lucy Lawless was considered for the role.[27]\n* Christopher Lee as Saruman the White: The fallen head of the Istari Order who succumbs to Sauron's will through his use of the *palantír*. Lee was a major fan of the book, and read it once a year. He had also met J. R. R. Tolkien.[23] He originally auditioned for Gandalf, but was judged too old.[12]\n* Hugo Weaving as Elrond: The Elven-Lord of Rivendell who leads the Council of Elrond, which ultimately decides to destroy the Ring. David Bowie expressed interest in the role, but Jackson stated, \"To have a famous, beloved character and a famous star colliding is slightly uncomfortable.\"[13]\n* Ian Holm as Bilbo Baggins: Frodo's uncle who gives him the Ring after he decides to retire to Rivendell. Holm previously played Frodo in a 1981 radio adaption of *The Lord of the Rings*, and was cast as Bilbo after Jackson remembered his performance.[12] Sylvester McCoy, who would later play Radagast the Brown in *The Hobbit*, was contacted about playing the role, and was kept in place as a potential Bilbo for six months before Jackson went with Holm.[28]\n* Andy Serkis as Gollum (voice/motion-capture): A wretched hobbit-like creature whose mind was poisoned by the Ring after bearing it for 500 years. This character appears briefly in the prologue. In Mordor, one can only hear his voice shouting and in Moria, only his eyes and his nose appear. Serkis was working on the 1999 six-episode *Oliver Twist* miniseries when his agent told him that Jackson wanted to approach him to play Gollum. Despite ultimately accepting the role, Serkis was initially doubtful about taking the part as one of his *Oliver Twist* fellow actors opined that it wasn't a good idea if his face wasn't going to appear onscreen, aside that Jackson was unsure if Gollum could be portrayed with motion-capture performance as they wished.[29]\n\n\nThe cast also includes:[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n* Sala Baker as Sauron:[30] The Dark Lord of Mordor and the Ring's true master, who manifests as an Eye after the destruction of his physical form.\n* Marton Csokas as Celeborn the Wise: The Elven-Lord of Lothlórien and Galadriel's husband.\n* Lawrence Makoare as Lurtz: The commander of Saruman's Uruk-Hai forces.\n* Craig Parker as Haldir: The leader of the Galadhrim warriors guarding the border of Lothlórien.\n* Mark Ferguson as Ereinion Gil-galad: The last Elven-King of the Noldor.\n* Peter McKenzie as Elendil the Tall: The last High King of Arnor and Gondor.\n* Harry Sinclair as Isildur: Elendil's son and Aragorn's ancestor who originally defeated Sauron.\n* Director Peter Jackson has a small cameo as a man with a carrot in Bree.\n\n\n## Comparison to the source material[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Peter Jackson's interpretation of The Lord of the Rings\n\nJackson, Walsh and Boyens made numerous changes to the story, for purposes of pacing and character development. Jackson said his main desire was to make a film focused primarily on Frodo and the Ring, the \"backbone\" of the story.[31] The prologue condenses Tolkien's backstory, in which The Last Alliance's seven-year siege of the Barad-dûr is a single battle, where Sauron is shown to explode, though Tolkien only said his spirit flees.[32]\n\n\nSome events and characters from the book are condensed or omitted (such is the case of Tom Bombadil) at the beginning of the film. The time between Gandalf leaving the Ring to Frodo and returning to reveal its inscription, which is 17 years in the book, is compressed for timing reasons.[33] The filmmakers also decided to move the opening scenes of *The Two Towers*, the Uruk-hai ambush and Boromir's death, to the film's linear climax.[31][33]\n\n\nThe tone of the Moria sequence was altered. In the book, following the defeat on the Caradhras road, Gandalf advocates the Moria road against the resistance of the rest of the Fellowship (save Gimli), suggesting \"there is a hope that Moria is still free...there is even a chance that Dwarves are there,\" though no one seems to think this likely. Frodo proposes they take a company vote, but the discovery of Wargs on their trail forces them to accept Gandalf's proposal. They only realize the Dwarves are all dead once they reach Balin's tomb. The filmmakers chose instead for Gandalf to resist the Moria plan as a foreshadowing device. Gandalf says to Gimli he would prefer not to enter Moria, and Saruman is shown to be aware of Gandalf's hesitance, revealing an illustration of the Balrog in one of his books. The corpses of the dwarves are instantly shown as the Fellowship enter Moria.[34] One detail that many critics commented upon is that, in the novel, Pippin tosses a mere pebble into the well in Moria (\"They then hear what sounds like a hammer tapping in the distance\"), whereas in the film, he knocks an entire skeleton in (\"Next, the skeleton ... falls down the well, also dragging down a chain and bucket. The noise is incredible.\").[35][36][37][38][39]\n\n\nWhen Frodo is struck by a Nazgûl at Weathertop, in the book, the elf Glorfindel rides him to Rivendell, whereas in the film, Arwen takes on this role.\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Production of *The Lord of the Rings* film series\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\nDirector Peter Jackson began working with Christian Rivers to storyboard the series in August 1997, as well as getting Richard Taylor and Weta Workshop to begin creating his interpretation of Middle-earth.[40] Jackson told them to make Middle-earth as plausible and believable as possible, and to think of it in a historical manner.[41]\n\n\nIn November,[41] Alan Lee and John Howe became the film trilogy's primary conceptual designers, having had previous experience as illustrators for the book and various other tie-ins. Lee worked for the Art Department creating places such as Rivendell, Isengard, Moria, and Lothlórien, giving Art Nouveau and geometry influences to the Elves and Dwarves respectively.[41][42] Though Howe contributed with Bag End and the Argonath,[41][42] he focused on the design of the characters' armour, having studied it his entire life.[43] Weta and the Art Department continued to design, with Grant Major turning the Art Department's designs into architecture, and Dan Hennah scouting locations.[41] On 1 April 1999, Ngila Dickson joined the crew as costume designer. She and 40 seamstresses would create 19,000 costumes, 40 per version for the actor and their doubles, wearing them out for an impression of age.[24]\n\n\n\n### Filming locations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Arwen faces the Nazgûl at the Fords of Bruinen (Arrow River)\nFilming took place in various locations across New Zealand. A list of filming locations, sorted by appearance order in the film:[44][45]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Fictionallocation\n | Specific locationin New Zealand\n | General areain New Zealand\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Mordor (Prologue) | Whakapapa skifield | Tongariro National Park |\n| Hobbiton | Matamata | Waikato |\n| Gardens of Isengard | Harcourt Park | Upper Hutt |\n| The Shire woods | Otaki Gorge Road | Kāpiti Coast District |\n| Bucklebury Ferry | Keeling Farm, Manakau | Horowhenua |\n| Forest near Bree | Takaka Hill | Nelson |\n| Trollshaws | Waitarere Forest | Horowhenua |\n| Flight to the Ford | Tarras | Central Otago |\n| Ford of Bruinen | Arrow River, Skippers Canyon | Queenstown and Arrowtown |\n| Rivendell | Kaitoke Regional Park | Upper Hutt |\n| Eregion | Mount Olympus | Nelson\n |\n| Dead Marshes | Kepler Mire | Southland |\n| Dimrill Dale | Lake Alta | The Remarkables |\n| Dimrill Dale | Mount Owen | Nelson\n |\n| Lothlórien | Paradise | Glenorchy |\n| River Anduin | Upper Waiau River | Fiordland National Park |\n| River Anduin | Rangitikei River | Rangitikei District |\n| River Anduin | Poets' Corner | Upper Hutt\n |\n| Parth Galen | Paradise | Glenorchy\n |\n| Amon Hen | Mavora Lakes, Paradise and Closeburn | Southern Lakes |\n\n\n### Special effects[edit]\n\n\n*The Fellowship of the Ring* makes extensive use of digital, practical and make-up special effects. One notable illusion used in almost every scene involved setting a proper scale so that the characters all appear to be the correct height. For example, Elijah Wood is 5 feet 6 inches (1.68 m) tall in real life, but his character, Frodo Baggins, is barely four feet in height. A variety of techniques were used to depict the hobbits and Gimli the Dwarf as being of diminutive stature. Fortunately, John-Rhys Davies – who played Gimli – happens to be the correct height in proportion to the hobbit actors, so did not need to be filmed separately as a third height variation. Large- and small-scale doubles were used in certain scenes, while entire duplicates of certain sets (including Bag End in Hobbiton) were built at two different scales, so that the characters would appear to be the appropriate size. At one point in the film, Frodo runs along a corridor in Bag End, followed by Gandalf. Elijah Wood and Ian McKellen were filmed in separate versions of the same corridor, built at two different scales, and a fast camera pan conceals the edit between the two. Forced perspective was also employed, so that it would look as though the short hobbits were interacting with taller Men and Elves. Even the simple use of kneeling down, to the filmmakers' surprise, turned out to be an effective method in creating the illusion.\n\n\nFor the battle between the Last Alliance and Sauron's forces that begins the film, an elaborate CGI animation system, called MASSIVE, was developed by Stephen Regelous; it allowed thousands of individual animated characters, or \"agents\" in the program, to act independently. This lent the illusion of realism to the battle sequences. The \"Making of\" Lord of the Rings DVD reports some interesting initial problems: for instance, in the first execution of a battle between groups of characters, the wrong groups attacked each other. In another early demo, some of the warriors at the edge of the field could be seen running away. They were initially moving in the wrong direction, and had been programmed to keep running until they encountered an enemy.\n\n\nThe digital creatures were important due to Jackson's requirement of biological plausibility. Their surface texture was scanned from large maquettes before numerous digital details of their skeletons and muscles were added. In the case of the Balrog, Gray Horsfield created a system that copied recorded imagery of fire.\n\n\n\n### Score[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring* (soundtrack)\n\nFor broader coverage of this topic, see Music of *The Lord of the Rings* film series.\n\nJames Horner turned down the offer to compose the score.[46] The musical score for *The Lord of the Rings* films was composed by Howard Shore. It was performed by the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, the London Philharmonic Orchestra, the London Voices, The London Oratory School Schola, and the Maori Samoan Choir, and featured several vocal soloists. Shore wrote almost four hours of finalized music for the film (of which just over three hours are used as underscore), featuring a number of non-orchestral instruments, and a large number (49–62) of leitmotives.\n\n\nTwo original songs, \"Aníron\" and the end title theme \"May It Be\", were composed and sung by Enya, who allowed her label, Reprise Records, to release the soundtrack to *The Fellowship of the Ring* and its two sequels. In addition to these, Shore composed \"In Dreams\", which was sung by Edward Ross of the London Oratory School Schola.\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\nThe world premiere of *The Fellowship of the Ring* was held at the Odeon Leicester Square in London on 10 December 2001. It was released on Wednesday, 19 December 2001 internationally in most major territories on 10,000 screens.[47] It opened in New Zealand on 20 December.\n\n\n\n### Marketing[edit]\n\n\nA special featurette trailer was released in 2000. The trilogy sizzle reel was shown before *Thirteen Days* and the teaser trailer before *Pearl Harbor*. The theatrical trailer was attached with the television premiere of *Angel* and before *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*. Both trailers appeared as Easter eggs on the *Rush Hour 2* and *Little Nicky* home video releases.\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n*The Fellowship of the Ring* was released on VHS and DVD on 6 August 2002.[48] It was the best-selling DVD release at the time with 14.5 million copies being sold. This record was dethroned by *Finding Nemo* the following year.[49]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Theatrical and extended release[edit]\n\n\nOn 12 November 2002, an extended edition was released on VHS and DVD, with 30 minutes of new material, added special effects and music, plus 19 minutes of fan-club credits, totaling to 228 minutes.[50][51][52] The DVD set included four commentaries and over three hours of supplementary material.\n\n\nOn 29 August 2006, a limited edition of *The Fellowship of the Ring* was released on DVD. The set included both the film's theatrical and extended editions on a double-sided disc along with all-new bonus material.\n\n\n\n#### Blu-ray edition[edit]\n\n\nThe theatrical Blu-ray version of *The Lord of the Rings* was released in the United States on 6 April 2010. There were two separate sets: one with digital copies and one without.[53] The individual Blu-ray disc of *The Fellowship of the Ring* was released on 14 September 2010 with the same special features as the complete trilogy release, except there was no digital copy.[54]\n\n\nThe extended Blu-ray editions were released in the US on 28 June 2011.[55] This version has a runtime of 238 minutes[51][56] (the extended editions include the names of all fan club members at the time of their release; the additional 10 minutes in the Blu-ray version are because of expanded member rolls, not any additional story material).\n\n\n*The Fellowship of the Ring* was released in Ultra HD Blu-ray on 30 November 2020 in the United Kingdom and on 1 December 2020 in the United States, along with the other films of the trilogy, including both the theatrical and the extended editions of the films.[57]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\nOn its opening day, it grossed $18.2 million in the United States and Canada from 3,359 cinemas and $11.5 million in 13 countries, including $3 million from 466 screens in the United Kingdom.[3][58] It grossed $75.1 million in its first five days in the United States and Canada, including $47.2 million on its opening weekend, placing it at number one at the US box office, setting a December opening record, beating *Ocean's Eleven*.[59][3]\n\n\nThe film also opened at number one in 29 international markets and remained there for a second week in all but the Netherlands. It set a record opening day gross in Australia with $2.09 million from 405 screens, beating the record $1.3 million set by *Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace*. It had a record opening weekend in Germany with 1.5 million admissions and in Spain with a gross of $5.3 million from 395 screens. It also grossed a record $2.5 million in 15 days in New Zealand.[60] This record would last for less than a decade before being surpassed by *Avatar*.[61] In its first 15 days, it had grossed $183.5 million internationally and $178.7 million in the United States and Canada for a worldwide total of $362.2 million.[60][3]\n\n\nIn its initial release, it went on to gross $313.4 million in the United States and Canada and $547.2 million in the rest of the world for a worldwide total of $860.5 million.[5] Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 54 million tickets in the US and Canada in its initial theatrical run.[62] Following subsequent reissues, the film has grossed $316.1 million in the United States and Canada and $582.1 million in the rest of the world for a worldwide total of $898.2 million.[3]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Differences between *The Lord of the Rings* book and film series\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 91% based on 235 reviews, with an average rating of 8.20/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"Full of eye-popping special effects, and featuring a pitch-perfect cast, *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring* brings J.R.R. Tolkien's classic to vivid life.\"[63] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 92 out of 100 based on 34 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[64] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale.[65]\n\n\n*The Fellowship of the Ring* was released to universal critical acclaim. Colin Kennedy for *Empire* gave the film five stars out of five, writing \"Brooking no argument, history should quickly regard Peter Jackson’s *The Fellowship of the Ring* as the first instalment of the best fantasy epic in motion picture history... Putting formula blockbusters to shame, *Fellowship* is impeccably cast and constructed with both care and passion: this is a labour of love that never feels laboured. Emotional range and character depth ultimately take us beyond genre limitations...\"[66] Roger Ebert of the *Chicago Sun-Times* gave the film three out of four stars and stating that while it is not \"a true visualization of Tolkien's Middle-earth\", it is \"a work for, and of, our times. It will be embraced, I suspect, by many Tolkien fans and take on aspects of a cult. It is a candidate for many Oscars. It is an awesome production in its daring and breadth, and there are small touches that are just right\".[67] *USA Today* also gave the film three out of four stars and wrote, \"this movie version of a beloved book should please devotees as well as the uninitiated\".[68] In his review for *The New York Times*, Elvis Mitchell wrote, \"The playful spookiness of Mr. Jackson's direction provides a lively, light touch, a gesture that doesn't normally come to mind when Tolkien's name is mentioned\".[69] Lisa Schwarzbaum for *Entertainment Weekly* gave the film an A grade and wrote \"The cast take to their roles with becoming modesty, certainly, but Jackson also makes it easy for them: His *Fellowship* flows, never lingering for the sake of admiring its own beauty ... Every detail of which engrossed me. I may have never turned a page of Tolkien, but I know enchantment when I see it\".[70] In his review for the BBC, Nev Pierce gave the film four stars out of five, describing it as \"Funny, scary, and totally involving\", and wrote that Jackson turned \"the book's least screen-worthy volume into a gripping and powerful adventure movie\".[71] In his review for *The Guardian*, Xan Brooks wrote \"Rather than a stand-alone holiday blockbuster, *The Fellowship of the Ring* offers an epic act one\", and commented that the ending was \"closer in spirit to an art-house film than a popcorn holiday romp\".[72]\n\n\nIn his review for the *New York Post*, Lou Lumenick gave the film four stars out of four, praising Jackson's direction, the casting, the sets, and the score, and describing the film as \"the three most exciting hours we've seen on a movie screen in years\" and \"easily one of the year's best movies\".[73] In her review for *The Washington Post*, Rita Kempley gave the film five stars out of five, and praised the cast, in particular, \"Mortensen, as Strider, is a revelation, not to mention downright gorgeous. And McKellen, carrying the burden of thousands of years' worth of the fight against evil, is positively Merlinesque\".[74] *Time* magazine's Richard Corliss praised Jackson's work: \"His movie achieves what the best fairy tales do: the creation of an alternate world, plausible and persuasive, where the young — and not only the young — can lose themselves. And perhaps, in identifying with the little Hobbit that could, find their better selves\".[75] In his review for *The Village Voice*, J. Hoberman wrote, \"Peter Jackson's adaptation is certainly successful on its own terms\".[76] *Rolling Stone* magazine's Peter Travers wrote, \"It's emotion that makes *Fellowship* stick hard in the memory... Jackson deserves to revel in his success. He's made a three-hour film that leaves you wanting more\".[77] A mixed review was written by Peter Bradshaw. Writing for *The Guardian*, he lauded the art direction and the visual look of the film, but he also commented \"there is a strange paucity of plot complication, an absence of anything unfolding, all the more disconcerting because of the clotted and indigestible mythic back story that we have to wade through before anything happens at all\". Overall, Bradshaw found the tone of the film too serious and self-important, and wrote \"signing up to the movie's whole hobbity-elvish universe requires a leap of faith... It's a leap I didn't feel much like making – and, with two more movie episodes like this on the way, the credibility gap looks wider than ever.\"[78] Jonathan Rosenbaum was also less positive about *The Fellowship of the Ring*: in his review for the *Chicago Reader*, he granted that the film was \"full of scenic splendors with a fine sense of scale\", but he commented that its narrative thrust seemed \"relatively pro forma\", and that he found the battle scenes boring.[79]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by *The Lord of the Rings* film series\n\nIn 2002, the film won four Academy Awards from thirteen nominations.[80] The winning categories were for Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, Best Makeup, and Best Original Score. It was also nominated for Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Ian McKellen), Best Art Direction, Best Director, Best Film Editing, Best Original Song (Enya, Nicky Ryan and Roma Ryan for \"May It Be\"), Best Picture, Best Sound (Christopher Boyes, Michael Semanick, Gethin Creagh and Hammond Peek), Best Costume Design and Best Adapted Screenplay.\n\n\nThe film won the 2002 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation. It also won *Empire* readers' Best Film award, as well as five BAFTAs, including Best Film, the David Lean Award for Best Direction, the Audience Award (voted for by the public), Best Special Effects, and Best Make-up. The film was nominated for an MTV Movie Award for Best Fight between Gandalf and Saruman.\n\n\nIn June 2008, AFI revealed its \"10 Top 10\"—the ten best films in ten \"classic\" American film genres—after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community. *The Fellowship of the Ring* was acknowledged as the second best film in the fantasy genre.[81][82] The film was also listed as the 50th best film in the 2007 list AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition).\n\n\n\n\n\n| Award\n | Category\n | Recipient/Nominee\n | Result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Academy Awards | Best Picture | Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh and Barrie M.

R. R. Tolkien. The film is the first instalment in *The Lord of the Rings* trilogy. It features an ensemble cast including Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Liv Tyler, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Cate Blanchett, John Rhys-Davies, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan, Orlando Bloom, Christopher Lee, Hugo Weaving, Sean Bean, Ian Holm, and Andy Serkis.\n\n\nSet in Middle-earth, the story tells of the Dark Lord Sauron, who seeks the One Ring, which contains part of his might, to return to power. The Ring has found its way to the young hobbit Frodo Baggins. The fate of Middle-earth hangs in the balance as Frodo and eight companions (who form the Fellowship of the Ring) begin their perilous journey to Mount Doom in the land of Mordor, the only place where the Ring can be destroyed. *The Fellowship of the Ring* was financed and distributed by American studio New Line Cinema, but filmed and edited entirely in Jackson's native New Zealand, concurrently with the other two parts of the trilogy. \n\n\nIt premiered on 10 December 2001 at the Odeon Leicester Square in London, and was then released on 19 December in the United States and on 20 December in New Zealand. The film was acclaimed by critics and fans alike, who considered it to be a landmark in filmmaking and an achievement in the fantasy film genre. It received praise for its visual effects, performances, Jackson's direction, screenplay, musical score, and faithfulness to the source material. It grossed over $880 million worldwide in its initial release, making it the second highest-grossing film of 2001 and the fifth highest-grossing film of all time at the time of its release.[5] Following subsequent reissues, it has as of 2021 grossed over $898 million.[4] Like its successors, *The Fellowship of the Ring* is widely recognized as one of the greatest and most influential films ever made. The film received numerous accolades; at the 74th Academy Awards, it was nominated for thirteen awards, including Best Picture, winning for Best Cinematography, Best Makeup, Best Original Score, and Best Visual Effects.\n\n\nIn 2007, the American Film Institute named it one of the 100 greatest American films in history, being both the most recent film and the only film released in the 21st century to make it to the list. In 2021, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".[6] Two sequels, *The Two Towers* and *The Return of the King*, followed in 2002 and 2003, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn the Second Age of Middle-earth, the lords of Elves, Dwarves, and Men are given Rings of Power. Unbeknownst to them, the Dark Lord Sauron forges the One Ring in Mount Doom, instilling into it a great part of his power, to dominate the other Rings and conquer Middle-earth. A final alliance of Men and Elves battles Sauron's forces in Mordor. Isildur of Gondor severs Sauron's finger and the Ring with it, thereby vanquishing Sauron and returning him to spirit form. With Sauron's first defeat, the Third Age of Middle-earth begins. The Ring's influence corrupts Isildur, who takes it for himself and is later killed by Orcs. The Ring is lost in a river for 2,500 years until it is found by Gollum, who owns it for over four and a half centuries. The ring abandons Gollum and it is subsequently found by a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, who is unaware of its history.\n\n\nSixty years later, Bilbo celebrates his 111th birthday in the Shire, reuniting with his old friend, the wizard Gandalf the Grey. Bilbo departs the Shire for one last adventure, and he leaves his inheritance, including the Ring, to his nephew Frodo. Gandalf investigates the Ring, discovers its true nature, and learns that Gollum was captured and brutally tortured by Sauron's Orcs, revealing two words during his interrogation: \"Shire\" and \"Baggins.\" Gandalf returns and warns Frodo to leave the Shire. As Frodo departs with his friend, gardener Samwise Gamgee, Gandalf rides to Isengard to meet with the wizard Saruman, but discovers his betrayal and alliance with Sauron, who has dispatched his nine undead Nazgûl servants to find Frodo.\n\n\nFrodo and Sam are joined by fellow hobbits Merry and Pippin, and they evade the Nazgûl before arriving in Bree, where they are meant to meet Gandalf at the Inn of The Prancing Pony. However, Gandalf never arrives, having been taken prisoner by Saruman. The hobbits are then aided by a Ranger named Strider, who promises to escort them to Rivendell; however, they are ambushed by the Nazgûl on Weathertop, and their leader, the Witch-King, stabs Frodo with a Morgul blade. Arwen, an Elf and Strider's beloved, locates Strider and rescues Frodo, summoning flood-waters that sweep the Nazgûl away. She takes him to Rivendell, where he is healed by the Elves. Frodo meets with Gandalf, who escaped Isengard on a Great Eagle. That night, Strider reunites with Arwen, and they affirm their love for each other.\n\n\nLearning of Saruman's betrayal from Gandalf and now realizing that they are facing threats from both Sauron and Saruman, Arwen's father, Lord Elrond, decides against keeping the Ring in Rivendell. He holds a council of Elves, Men, and Dwarves, also attended by Frodo and Gandalf, that decides the Ring must be destroyed in the fires of Mount Doom. Frodo volunteers to take the Ring, accompanied by Gandalf, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Elf Legolas, Dwarf Gimli, Boromir of Gondor, and Strider—who is actually Aragorn, Isildur's heir and the rightful King of Gondor. Bilbo, now living in Rivendell, gives Frodo his sword Sting, and a chainmail shirt made of *mithril*.\n\n\nThe Fellowship of the Ring makes for the Gap of Rohan, but discover it is being watched by Saruman's spies. They instead set off over the mountain pass of Caradhras, but Saruman summons a storm that forces them to travel through the Mines of Moria, where a tentacled water beast blocks off the entrance with the Fellowship inside, giving them no choice but to journey to the exit on the other end. After finding the Dwarves of Moria dead, the Fellowship is attacked by Orcs and a cave troll. They hold them off but are confronted by Durin's Bane: a Balrog residing within the mines. While the others escape, Gandalf fends off the Balrog and casts it into a vast chasm, but the Balrog drags Gandalf down into the darkness with him. The devastated Fellowship reaches Lothlórien, ruled by the Elf-queen Galadriel, who privately informs Frodo that only he can complete the quest and that one of the Fellowship will try to take the Ring. She also shows him a vision of the future in which Sauron succeeds in enslaving Middle-earth, including the Shire. Meanwhile, Saruman creates an army of Uruk-hai in Isengard to find and kill the Fellowship.\n\n\nThe Fellowship travels by river to Parth Galen. Frodo wanders off and is confronted by Boromir, who, as Lady Galadriel had warned, tries to take the Ring. Uruk-hai scouts then ambush the Fellowship, attempting to abduct the Hobbits. Boromir breaks free of the Ring's magic and protects Merry and Pippin, but the Uruk-Hai leader, Lurtz, mortally wounds Boromir as they abduct the Hobbits. Aragorn arrives and kills Lurtz before comforting Boromir as he dies, promising to help the people of Gondor in the coming conflict. Fearing the Ring will corrupt his friends, Frodo decides to travel to Mordor alone, but allows Sam to come along, recalling his promise to Gandalf to look after him. As Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli set out to rescue Merry and Pippin, Frodo and Sam make their way down the mountain pass of Emyn Muil, journeying on to Mordor. \n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Cast of *The Lord of the Rings* film series\n\n![](image)The eponymous Fellowship from left to right: (Top row) Aragorn, Gandalf, Legolas, Boromir, (bottom row) Sam, Frodo, Merry, Pippin, Gimli\nBefore filming began on 11 October 1999, the principal actors trained for six weeks in sword fighting (with Bob Anderson), riding and boating. Jackson hoped such activities would allow the cast to bond so chemistry would be evident on screen as well as getting them used to life in Wellington.[7] They were also trained to pronounce Tolkien's verses properly.[8] After the shoot, the nine cast members playing the Fellowship got a tattoo, the Elvish symbol for the number nine, with the exception of John Rhys-Davies, whose stunt double got the tattoo instead.[9] The film is noted for having an ensemble cast,[10] and some of the cast and their respective characters include:\n\n\n\n* Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins: A young hobbit who inherits the One Ring from his uncle Bilbo. Wood was the first actor to be cast on 7 July 1999.[11] Wood was a fan of the book, and he sent in an audition dressed as Frodo, reading lines from the novel.[12] Wood was selected from 150 actors who auditioned.[13] Jake Gyllenhaal unsuccessfully auditioned for the role.[14]\n* Ian McKellen as Gandalf the Grey: An Istari wizard and mentor to Frodo. Sean Connery was approached for the role, but did not understand the plot,[12] while Patrick Stewart turned it down as he disliked the script.[15] Patrick McGoohan was also offered the role, but turned it down due to health issues.[16] Anthony Hopkins and Christopher Plummer also turned down the role.[17][18] Richard Harris expressed interest in the part.[19] John Astin auditioned for Gandalf.[20] Sam Neill was also offered the role but declined due to his scheduling conflict with *Jurassic Park III*. Before being cast, McKellen had to sort his schedule with 20th Century Fox as there was a two-month overlap with *X-Men*.[13] He enjoyed playing Gandalf the Grey more than his transformed state in the next two films,[9] and based his accent on Tolkien. Unlike his on-screen character, McKellen did not spend much time with the actors playing the Hobbits; instead he worked with their scale doubles.[7]\n* Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn: A Dúnedain ranger and heir to Gondor's throne. Daniel Day-Lewis was offered the part at the beginning of pre-production, but turned it down.[21] Nicolas Cage also received an offer, declining because of \"family obligations\",[22] while Vin Diesel, a fan of the book, auditioned for Aragorn.[*citation needed*] Stuart Townsend was cast in the role, before being replaced during filming when Jackson realised he was too young.[12] Russell Crowe was considered as a replacement, but he turned it down because he does not want to be typecast and believed it to be a similar role in *Gladiator*.[12] Day-Lewis was offered the role for a second time, but declined again.[21] Executive producer Mark Ordesky saw Mortensen in a play. Mortensen's son, a fan of the book, convinced him to take the role.[7] Mortensen read the book on the plane, received a crash course lesson in fencing from Bob Anderson and began filming the scenes on Weathertop.[23] Mortensen became a hit with the crew by patching up his costume[24] and carrying his \"hero\" sword around with him off-camera.[7]\n* Sean Astin as Samwise Gamgee: Better known as Sam, a hobbit gardener and Frodo's best friend. Astin, who had recently become a father, bonded with the 18-year-old Wood in a protective manner, which mirrored Sam's relationship with Frodo.[7] before Astin was cast, James Corden read for the part.[25]\n* Sean Bean as Boromir: A son of the Stewards of Gondor who journeys with the Fellowship towards Mordor. Bruce Willis, a fan of the book, expressed interest in the role, while Liam Neeson was sent the script, but passed.[12]\n* Billy Boyd as Peregrin Took: Better known as Pippin, an extremely foolish hobbit who is a distant cousin of Frodo and travels with the Fellowship on their journey to Mordor.\n* Dominic Monaghan as Meriadoc Brandybuck: Better known as Merry, a distant cousin of Frodo. Monaghan was cast as Merry after auditioning for Frodo.[12]\n* John Rhys-Davies as Gimli: A dwarf warrior who accompanies the Fellowship to Mordor after they set out from Rivendell. Billy Connolly, who was considered for the part of Gimli, would later portray Dáin II Ironfoot in Peter Jackson's *The Hobbit* film trilogy.[12] Rhys-Davies wore heavy prosthetics to play Gimli, which limited his vision, and eventually he developed eczema around his eyes.[7] Rhys-Davies also played Gimli's father Glóin during the scene where the fellowship is forged.\n* Orlando Bloom as Legolas: A prince of the elves' Woodland Realm and a skilled archer. Bloom initially auditioned for Faramir, who appears in the second film, a role which went to David Wenham.[12]\n* Liv Tyler as Arwen: An elf of Rivendell and Aragorn's lover. The filmmakers approached Tyler after seeing her performance in *Plunkett & Macleane*, and New Line Cinema leaped at the opportunity of having one Hollywood star in the film. Actress Helena Bonham Carter had expressed interest in the role.[12] Tyler came to shoot on short occasions, unlike the rest of the actors. She was one of the last actors to be cast, on 25 August 1999.[26]\n* Cate Blanchett as Galadriel: The elven co-ruler of Lothlórien alongside her husband Celeborn. Lucy Lawless was considered for the role.[27]\n* Christopher Lee as Saruman the White: The fallen head of the Istari Order who succumbs to Sauron's will through his use of the *palantír*. Lee was a major fan of the book, and read it once a year. He had also met J. R. R. Tolkien.[23] He originally auditioned for Gandalf, but was judged too old.[12]\n* Hugo Weaving as Elrond: The Elven-Lord of Rivendell who leads the Council of Elrond, which ultimately decides to destroy the Ring. David Bowie expressed interest in the role, but Jackson stated, \"To have a famous, beloved character and a famous star colliding is slightly uncomfortable.\"[13]\n* Ian Holm as Bilbo Baggins: Frodo's uncle who gives him the Ring after he decides to retire to Rivendell. Holm previously played Frodo in a 1981 radio adaption of *The Lord of the Rings*, and was cast as Bilbo after Jackson remembered his performance.[12] Sylvester McCoy, who would later play Radagast the Brown in *The Hobbit*, was contacted about playing the role, and was kept in place as a potential Bilbo for six months before Jackson went with Holm.[28]\n* Andy Serkis as Gollum (voice/motion-capture): A wretched hobbit-like creature whose mind was poisoned by the Ring after bearing it for 500 years. This character appears briefly in the prologue. In Mordor, one can only hear his voice shouting and in Moria, only his eyes and his nose appear. Serkis was working on the 1999 six-episode *Oliver Twist* miniseries when his agent told him that Jackson wanted to approach him to play Gollum. Despite ultimately accepting the role, Serkis was initially doubtful about taking the part as one of his *Oliver Twist* fellow actors opined that it wasn't a good idea if his face wasn't going to appear onscreen, aside that Jackson was unsure if Gollum could be portrayed with motion-capture performance as they wished.[29]\n\n\nThe cast also includes:[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n* Sala Baker as Sauron:[30] The Dark Lord of Mordor and the Ring's true master, who manifests as an Eye after the destruction of his physical form.\n* Marton Csokas as Celeborn the Wise: The Elven-Lord of Lothlórien and Galadriel's husband.\n* Lawrence Makoare as Lurtz: The commander of Saruman's Uruk-Hai forces.\n* Craig Parker as Haldir: The leader of the Galadhrim warriors guarding the border of Lothlórien.\n* Mark Ferguson as Ereinion Gil-galad: The last Elven-King of the Noldor.\n* Peter McKenzie as Elendil the Tall: The last High King of Arnor and Gondor.\n* Harry Sinclair as Isildur: Elendil's son and Aragorn's ancestor who originally defeated Sauron.\n* Director Peter Jackson has a small cameo as a man with a carrot in Bree.\n\n\n## Comparison to the source material[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Peter Jackson's interpretation of The Lord of the Rings\n\nJackson, Walsh and Boyens made numerous changes to the story, for purposes of pacing and character development. Jackson said his main desire was to make a film focused primarily on Frodo and the Ring, the \"backbone\" of the story.[31] The prologue condenses Tolkien's backstory, in which The Last Alliance's seven-year siege of the Barad-dûr is a single battle, where Sauron is shown to explode, though Tolkien only said his spirit flees.[32]\n\n\nSome events and characters from the book are condensed or omitted (such is the case of Tom Bombadil) at the beginning of the film. The time between Gandalf leaving the Ring to Frodo and returning to reveal its inscription, which is 17 years in the book, is compressed for timing reasons.[33] The filmmakers also decided to move the opening scenes of *The Two Towers*, the Uruk-hai ambush and Boromir's death, to the film's linear climax.[31][33]\n\n\nThe tone of the Moria sequence was altered. In the book, following the defeat on the Caradhras road, Gandalf advocates the Moria road against the resistance of the rest of the Fellowship (save Gimli), suggesting \"there is a hope that Moria is still free...there is even a chance that Dwarves are there,\" though no one seems to think this likely. Frodo proposes they take a company vote, but the discovery of Wargs on their trail forces them to accept Gandalf's proposal. They only realize the Dwarves are all dead once they reach Balin's tomb. The filmmakers chose instead for Gandalf to resist the Moria plan as a foreshadowing device. Gandalf says to Gimli he would prefer not to enter Moria, and Saruman is shown to be aware of Gandalf's hesitance, revealing an illustration of the Balrog in one of his books. The corpses of the dwarves are instantly shown as the Fellowship enter Moria.[34] One detail that many critics commented upon is that, in the novel, Pippin tosses a mere pebble into the well in Moria (\"They then hear what sounds like a hammer tapping in the distance\"), whereas in the film, he knocks an entire skeleton in (\"Next, the skeleton ... falls down the well, also dragging down a chain and bucket. The noise is incredible.\").[35][36][37][38][39]\n\n\nWhen Frodo is struck by a Nazgûl at Weathertop, in the book, the elf Glorfindel rides him to Rivendell, whereas in the film, Arwen takes on this role.\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Production of *The Lord of the Rings* film series\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\nDirector Peter Jackson began working with Christian Rivers to storyboard the series in August 1997, as well as getting Richard Taylor and Weta Workshop to begin creating his interpretation of Middle-earth.[40] Jackson told them to make Middle-earth as plausible and believable as possible, and to think of it in a historical manner.[41]\n\n\nIn November,[41] Alan Lee and John Howe became the film trilogy's primary conceptual designers, having had previous experience as illustrators for the book and various other tie-ins. Lee worked for the Art Department creating places such as Rivendell, Isengard, Moria, and Lothlórien, giving Art Nouveau and geometry influences to the Elves and Dwarves respectively.[41][42] Though Howe contributed with Bag End and the Argonath,[41][42] he focused on the design of the characters' armour, having studied it his entire life.[43] Weta and the Art Department continued to design, with Grant Major turning the Art Department's designs into architecture, and Dan Hennah scouting locations.[41] On 1 April 1999, Ngila Dickson joined the crew as costume designer. She and 40 seamstresses would create 19,000 costumes, 40 per version for the actor and their doubles, wearing them out for an impression of age.[24]\n\n\n\n### Filming locations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Arwen faces the Nazgûl at the Fords of Bruinen (Arrow River)\nFilming took place in various locations across New Zealand. A list of filming locations, sorted by appearance order in the film:[44][45]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Fictionallocation\n | Specific locationin New Zealand\n | General areain New Zealand\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Mordor (Prologue) | Whakapapa skifield | Tongariro National Park |\n| Hobbiton | Matamata | Waikato |\n| Gardens of Isengard | Harcourt Park | Upper Hutt |\n| The Shire woods | Otaki Gorge Road | Kāpiti Coast District |\n| Bucklebury Ferry | Keeling Farm, Manakau | Horowhenua |\n| Forest near Bree | Takaka Hill | Nelson |\n| Trollshaws | Waitarere Forest | Horowhenua |\n| Flight to the Ford | Tarras | Central Otago |\n| Ford of Bruinen | Arrow River, Skippers Canyon | Queenstown and Arrowtown |\n| Rivendell | Kaitoke Regional Park | Upper Hutt |\n| Eregion | Mount Olympus | Nelson\n |\n| Dead Marshes | Kepler Mire | Southland |\n| Dimrill Dale | Lake Alta | The Remarkables |\n| Dimrill Dale | Mount Owen | Nelson\n |\n| Lothlórien | Paradise | Glenorchy |\n| River Anduin | Upper Waiau River | Fiordland National Park |\n| River Anduin | Rangitikei River | Rangitikei District |\n| River Anduin | Poets' Corner | Upper Hutt\n |\n| Parth Galen | Paradise | Glenorchy\n |\n| Amon Hen | Mavora Lakes, Paradise and Closeburn | Southern Lakes |\n\n\n### Special effects[edit]\n\n\n*The Fellowship of the Ring* makes extensive use of digital, practical and make-up special effects. One notable illusion used in almost every scene involved setting a proper scale so that the characters all appear to be the correct height. For example, Elijah Wood is 5 feet 6 inches (1.68 m) tall in real life, but his character, Frodo Baggins, is barely four feet in height. A variety of techniques were used to depict the hobbits and Gimli the Dwarf as being of diminutive stature. Fortunately, John-Rhys Davies – who played Gimli – happens to be the correct height in proportion to the hobbit actors, so did not need to be filmed separately as a third height variation. Large- and small-scale doubles were used in certain scenes, while entire duplicates of certain sets (including Bag End in Hobbiton) were built at two different scales, so that the characters would appear to be the appropriate size. At one point in the film, Frodo runs along a corridor in Bag End, followed by Gandalf. Elijah Wood and Ian McKellen were filmed in separate versions of the same corridor, built at two different scales, and a fast camera pan conceals the edit between the two. Forced perspective was also employed, so that it would look as though the short hobbits were interacting with taller Men and Elves. Even the simple use of kneeling down, to the filmmakers' surprise, turned out to be an effective method in creating the illusion.\n\n\nFor the battle between the Last Alliance and Sauron's forces that begins the film, an elaborate CGI animation system, called MASSIVE, was developed by Stephen Regelous; it allowed thousands of individual animated characters, or \"agents\" in the program, to act independently. This lent the illusion of realism to the battle sequences. The \"Making of\" Lord of the Rings DVD reports some interesting initial problems: for instance, in the first execution of a battle between groups of characters, the wrong groups attacked each other. In another early demo, some of the warriors at the edge of the field could be seen running away. They were initially moving in the wrong direction, and had been programmed to keep running until they encountered an enemy.\n\n\nThe digital creatures were important due to Jackson's requirement of biological plausibility. Their surface texture was scanned from large maquettes before numerous digital details of their skeletons and muscles were added. In the case of the Balrog, Gray Horsfield created a system that copied recorded imagery of fire.\n\n\n\n### Score[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring* (soundtrack)\n\nFor broader coverage of this topic, see Music of *The Lord of the Rings* film series.\n\nJames Horner turned down the offer to compose the score.[46] The musical score for *The Lord of the Rings* films was composed by Howard Shore. It was performed by the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, the London Philharmonic Orchestra, the London Voices, The London Oratory School Schola, and the Maori Samoan Choir, and featured several vocal soloists. Shore wrote almost four hours of finalized music for the film (of which just over three hours are used as underscore), featuring a number of non-orchestral instruments, and a large number (49–62) of leitmotives.\n\n\nTwo original songs, \"Aníron\" and the end title theme \"May It Be\", were composed and sung by Enya, who allowed her label, Reprise Records, to release the soundtrack to *The Fellowship of the Ring* and its two sequels. In addition to these, Shore composed \"In Dreams\", which was sung by Edward Ross of the London Oratory School Schola.\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\nThe world premiere of *The Fellowship of the Ring* was held at the Odeon Leicester Square in London on 10 December 2001. It was released on Wednesday, 19 December 2001 internationally in most major territories on 10,000 screens.[47] It opened in New Zealand on 20 December.\n\n\n\n### Marketing[edit]\n\n\nA special featurette trailer was released in 2000. The trilogy sizzle reel was shown before *Thirteen Days* and the teaser trailer before *Pearl Harbor*. The theatrical trailer was attached with the television premiere of *Angel* and before *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*. Both trailers appeared as Easter eggs on the *Rush Hour 2* and *Little Nicky* home video releases.\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n*The Fellowship of the Ring* was released on VHS and DVD on 6 August 2002.[48] It was the best-selling DVD release at the time with 14.5 million copies being sold. This record was dethroned by *Finding Nemo* the following year.[49]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Theatrical and extended release[edit]\n\n\nOn 12 November 2002, an extended edition was released on VHS and DVD, with 30 minutes of new material, added special effects and music, plus 19 minutes of fan-club credits, totaling to 228 minutes.[50][51][52] The DVD set included four commentaries and over three hours of supplementary material.\n\n\nOn 29 August 2006, a limited edition of *The Fellowship of the Ring* was released on DVD. The set included both the film's theatrical and extended editions on a double-sided disc along with all-new bonus material.\n\n\n\n#### Blu-ray edition[edit]\n\n\nThe theatrical Blu-ray version of *The Lord of the Rings* was released in the United States on 6 April 2010. There were two separate sets: one with digital copies and one without.[53] The individual Blu-ray disc of *The Fellowship of the Ring* was released on 14 September 2010 with the same special features as the complete trilogy release, except there was no digital copy.[54]\n\n\nThe extended Blu-ray editions were released in the US on 28 June 2011.[55] This version has a runtime of 238 minutes[51][56] (the extended editions include the names of all fan club members at the time of their release; the additional 10 minutes in the Blu-ray version are because of expanded member rolls, not any additional story material).\n\n\n*The Fellowship of the Ring* was released in Ultra HD Blu-ray on 30 November 2020 in the United Kingdom and on 1 December 2020 in the United States, along with the other films of the trilogy, including both the theatrical and the extended editions of the films.[57]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\nOn its opening day, it grossed $18.2 million in the United States and Canada from 3,359 cinemas and $11.5 million in 13 countries, including $3 million from 466 screens in the United Kingdom.[3][58] It grossed $75.1 million in its first five days in the United States and Canada, including $47.2 million on its opening weekend, placing it at number one at the US box office, setting a December opening record, beating *Ocean's Eleven*.[59][3]\n\n\nThe film also opened at number one in 29 international markets and remained there for a second week in all but the Netherlands. It set a record opening day gross in Australia with $2.09 million from 405 screens, beating the record $1.3 million set by *Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace*. It had a record opening weekend in Germany with 1.5 million admissions and in Spain with a gross of $5.3 million from 395 screens. It also grossed a record $2.5 million in 15 days in New Zealand.[60] This record would last for less than a decade before being surpassed by *Avatar*.[61] In its first 15 days, it had grossed $183.5 million internationally and $178.7 million in the United States and Canada for a worldwide total of $362.2 million.[60][3]\n\n\nIn its initial release, it went on to gross $313.4 million in the United States and Canada and $547.2 million in the rest of the world for a worldwide total of $860.5 million.[5] Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 54 million tickets in the US and Canada in its initial theatrical run.[62] Following subsequent reissues, the film has grossed $316.1 million in the United States and Canada and $582.1 million in the rest of the world for a worldwide total of $898.2 million.[3]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Differences between *The Lord of the Rings* book and film series\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 91% based on 235 reviews, with an average rating of 8.20/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"Full of eye-popping special effects, and featuring a pitch-perfect cast, *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring* brings J.R.R. Tolkien's classic to vivid life.\"[63] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 92 out of 100 based on 34 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[64] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale.[65]\n\n\n*The Fellowship of the Ring* was released to universal critical acclaim. Colin Kennedy for *Empire* gave the film five stars out of five, writing \"Brooking no argument, history should quickly regard Peter Jackson’s *The Fellowship of the Ring* as the first instalment of the best fantasy epic in motion picture history... Putting formula blockbusters to shame, *Fellowship* is impeccably cast and constructed with both care and passion: this is a labour of love that never feels laboured. Emotional range and character depth ultimately take us beyond genre limitations...\"[66] Roger Ebert of the *Chicago Sun-Times* gave the film three out of four stars and stating that while it is not \"a true visualization of Tolkien's Middle-earth\", it is \"a work for, and of, our times. It will be embraced, I suspect, by many Tolkien fans and take on aspects of a cult. It is a candidate for many Oscars. It is an awesome production in its daring and breadth, and there are small touches that are just right\".[67] *USA Today* also gave the film three out of four stars and wrote, \"this movie version of a beloved book should please devotees as well as the uninitiated\".[68] In his review for *The New York Times*, Elvis Mitchell wrote, \"The playful spookiness of Mr. Jackson's direction provides a lively, light touch, a gesture that doesn't normally come to mind when Tolkien's name is mentioned\".[69] Lisa Schwarzbaum for *Entertainment Weekly* gave the film an A grade and wrote \"The cast take to their roles with becoming modesty, certainly, but Jackson also makes it easy for them: His *Fellowship* flows, never lingering for the sake of admiring its own beauty ... Every detail of which engrossed me. I may have never turned a page of Tolkien, but I know enchantment when I see it\".[70] In his review for the BBC, Nev Pierce gave the film four stars out of five, describing it as \"Funny, scary, and totally involving\", and wrote that Jackson turned \"the book's least screen-worthy volume into a gripping and powerful adventure movie\".[71] In his review for *The Guardian*, Xan Brooks wrote \"Rather than a stand-alone holiday blockbuster, *The Fellowship of the Ring* offers an epic act one\", and commented that the ending was \"closer in spirit to an art-house film than a popcorn holiday romp\".[72]\n\n\nIn his review for the *New York Post*, Lou Lumenick gave the film four stars out of four, praising Jackson's direction, the casting, the sets, and the score, and describing the film as \"the three most exciting hours we've seen on a movie screen in years\" and \"easily one of the year's best movies\".[73] In her review for *The Washington Post*, Rita Kempley gave the film five stars out of five, and praised the cast, in particular, \"Mortensen, as Strider, is a revelation, not to mention downright gorgeous. And McKellen, carrying the burden of thousands of years' worth of the fight against evil, is positively Merlinesque\".[74] *Time* magazine's Richard Corliss praised Jackson's work: \"His movie achieves what the best fairy tales do: the creation of an alternate world, plausible and persuasive, where the young — and not only the young — can lose themselves. And perhaps, in identifying with the little Hobbit that could, find their better selves\".[75] In his review for *The Village Voice*, J. Hoberman wrote, \"Peter Jackson's adaptation is certainly successful on its own terms\".[76] *Rolling Stone* magazine's Peter Travers wrote, \"It's emotion that makes *Fellowship* stick hard in the memory... Jackson deserves to revel in his success. He's made a three-hour film that leaves you wanting more\".[77] A mixed review was written by Peter Bradshaw. Writing for *The Guardian*, he lauded the art direction and the visual look of the film, but he also commented \"there is a strange paucity of plot complication, an absence of anything unfolding, all the more disconcerting because of the clotted and indigestible mythic back story that we have to wade through before anything happens at all\". Overall, Bradshaw found the tone of the film too serious and self-important, and wrote \"signing up to the movie's whole hobbity-elvish universe requires a leap of faith... It's a leap I didn't feel much like making – and, with two more movie episodes like this on the way, the credibility gap looks wider than ever.\"[78] Jonathan Rosenbaum was also less positive about *The Fellowship of the Ring*: in his review for the *Chicago Reader*, he granted that the film was \"full of scenic splendors with a fine sense of scale\", but he commented that its narrative thrust seemed \"relatively pro forma\", and that he found the battle scenes boring.[79]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by *The Lord of the Rings* film series\n\nIn 2002, the film won four Academy Awards from thirteen nominations.[80] The winning categories were for Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, Best Makeup, and Best Original Score.

At age seven, he began modeling and taking piano lessons in his hometown.[8][9] In elementary school, he appeared in *The Sound of Music* and played the title character in *The Wonderful Wizard of Oz*. He also served as a choirboy in a production of *See How They Run*. His parents sold their delicatessen in 1989 and the family, without his father, moved to Los Angeles in order for Wood to pursue an acting career. His parents divorced when he was 15.[10]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 1988–1998: Early work[edit]\n\n\nWood modeled and appeared in local commercials. He got his first break in the music video for Paula Abdul's \"Forever Your Girl,\" directed by David Fincher. This was followed by a pivotal role in the made-for-TV film, *Child in the Night,* and a minor role in *Back to the Future Part II*, as a boy from a futuristic 2015 who teases Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) for playing an arcade game because \"you have to use your hands\".[11] Nine-year-old Wood auditioned for a role in *Kindergarten Cop*, but was told by director Ivan Reitman that his performance was not believable, which Wood later said was \"a harsh thing to say to a nine-year-old.\"[12]\n\n\nPlaying Aidan Quinn's son in *Avalon* garnered professional attention for Wood; the film received widespread critical acclaim and was nominated for four Academy Awards.[13] A small part in Richard Gere's *Internal Affairs* was followed by the role of a boy who brings estranged couple Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson back together in *Paradise* (1991). In 1992, Wood co-starred with Mel Gibson and Jamie Lee Curtis in *Forever Young*,[14] and with Joseph Mazzello in *Radio Flyer*.[15]\n\n\nIn 1993, Wood played the title character in Disney's adaptation of Mark Twain's novel, *The Adventures of Huck Finn*, and co-starred with Macaulay Culkin in the psychological thriller *The Good Son*. The following year, he starred in *The War*, alongside Kevin Costner. Roger Ebert's review of the film praised Wood highly, stating that Wood \"has emerged, I believe, as the most talented actor, in his age group, in Hollywood history.\"[16]\n\n\nWood's title role–opposite Bruce Willis–in the Robert Reiner film *North* (1994) was followed by a Super Bowl commercial for Lay's \"Wavy\" potato chips (with Dan Quayle).[17] In 1995, Wood appeared in the music video for The Cranberries' \"Ridiculous Thoughts,\"[18] played the lead role in *Flipper*, and co-starred in Ang Lee's critically acclaimed *The Ice Storm*.[19] In 1997, Wood played Jack \"The Artful Dodger\" Dawkins in a made-for-TV adaptation of *Oliver Twist*, alongside Richard Dreyfuss.[20] The following year, he had a leading role in the sci-fi disaster film *Deep Impact,* and a starring role in *The Faculty*, directed by Robert Rodriguez. In 1999, Wood played a suburban white teenager who affects hip-hop lingo in James Toback's *Black and White*, and a junior hitman in *Chain of Fools*.[21]\n\n\n\n### 1999–2003: *The Lord of the Rings*[edit]\n\n\nWood played Frodo Baggins in the 2001 *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring*, the first installment of Peter Jackson's adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's multi-volume novel. Wood was a fan of the book series, and he sent in an audition dressed as Frodo, reading lines from the novel.[22] He was selected from 150 actors who auditioned.[23] Wood was the first actor to be cast.[24] This gave Wood top billing, alongside a cast that included Ian McKellen, Liv Tyler, Orlando Bloom, Cate Blanchett, Christopher Lee, Miranda Otto, Sean Bean, Sean Astin, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan, Viggo Mortensen, and John Rhys-Davies.[25][26][27] \nThe *Lord of the Rings* trilogy was filmed in New Zealand, in a process taking more than one year for principal photography alone, with pick-up shots annually for the next four years.[28][29]\nBefore the cast left the country, Jackson gave Wood two gifts: one of the One Ring props used on the set and Sting, Frodo's sword. He was also given a pair of prosthetic \"hobbit feet\" of the type worn during filming.[30]\n\n\nIn 2002, Wood lent his voice to the DTV release of *The Adventures of Tom Thumb and Thumbelina*. Later that year, the second part of Peter Jackson's trilogy was released, titled *The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers*, in which Wood had a reduced role from the first movie. \nIn 2003, Wood starred in the DTV film *All I Want* and also cameoed as 'The Guy' in *Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over*.

With a career spanning more than six decades, he is noted for his roles on the screen and stage in genres ranging from Shakespearean dramas and modern theatre to popular fantasy and science fiction. He is regarded as a British cultural icon and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1991.[2][3] He has received numerous accolades, including a Tony Award, six Olivier Awards, and a Golden Globe Award as well as nominations for two Academy Awards, five BAFTA Awards and five Emmy Awards.\n\n\nMcKellen made his stage debut in 1961 at the Belgrade Theatre as a member of their repertory company. In 1965, McKellen made his first West End appearance. In 1969, he was invited to join the Prospect Theatre Company to play the lead parts in Shakespeare's *Richard II* and Marlowe's *Edward II*. In the 1970s, McKellen became a stalwart of the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theatre of Great Britain. He has earned five Olivier Awards for his roles in *Pillars of the Community* (1977), *The Alchemist* (1978), *Bent* (1979), *Wild Honey* (1984), and *Richard III* (1995). \n\n\nMcKellen made his Broadway debut in *The Promise* (1965). He went on to receive the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play for his role as Antonio Salieri in *Amadeus* (1980). He was further nominated for *Ian McKellen: Acting Shakespeare* (1984). He returned to Broadway in *Wild Honey* (1986), *Dance of Death* (1990), *No Man's Land* (2013), and *Waiting for Godot* (2013), the latter being a joint production with Patrick Stewart.[4]\n\n\nMcKellen achieved worldwide fame for his film roles, including the titular King in *Richard III* (1995), James Whale in *Gods and Monsters* (1998), Magneto in the *X-Men* films, and Gandalf in *The Lord of the Rings* (2001–2003) and *The Hobbit* (2012–2014) trilogies. Other notable film roles include *A Touch of Love* (1969), *Plenty* (1985), *Six Degrees of Separation* (1993), *Restoration* (1995), *Mr. Holmes* (2015), and *The Good Liar* (2019).\n\n\nMcKellen came out as gay in 1988, and has since championed LGBT social movements worldwide. He was awarded the Freedom of the City of London in October 2014.[5] McKellen is a co-founder of Stonewall, an LGBT rights lobby group in the United Kingdom, named after the Stonewall riots.[6] He is also patron of LGBT History Month,[7] Pride London, Oxford Pride, GAY-GLOS, LGBT Foundation and FFLAG.[8]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nMcKellen was born on 25 May 1939 in Burnley, Lancashire,[9][10] the son of Margery Lois (née Sutcliffe) and Denis Murray McKellen. He was their second child, with a sister, Jean, five years his senior.[11] Shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, his family moved to Wigan. They lived there until Ian was twelve years old, before relocating to Bolton in 1951 after his father had been promoted.[11][12] The experience of living through the war as a young child had a lasting impact on him, and he later said that \"only after peace resumed ... did I realise that war wasn't normal\".[12] When an interviewer remarked that he seemed quite calm in the aftermath of the 11 September attacks, McKellen said: \"Well, darling, you forget—I slept under a steel plate until I was four years old\".[13]\n\n\nMcKellen's father was a civil engineer[14] and lay preacher, and was of Protestant Irish and Scottish descent.[15] Both of McKellen's grandfathers were preachers, and his great-great-grandfather, James McKellen, was a \"strict, evangelical Protestant minister\" in Ballymena, County Antrim.[16] His home environment was strongly Christian, but non-orthodox. \"My upbringing was of low nonconformist Christians who felt that you led the Christian life in part by behaving in a Christian manner to everybody you met\".[17] When he was 12, his mother died of breast cancer; his father died when he was 25. After his coming out as gay to his stepmother, Gladys McKellen, who was a Quaker, he said, \"Not only was she not fazed, but as a member of a society which declared its indifference to people's sexuality years back, I think she was just glad for my sake that I wasn't lying any more\".[18] His great-great-grandfather Robert J. Lowes was an activist and campaigner in the ultimately successful campaign for a Saturday half-holiday in Manchester, the forerunner to the modern five-day work week, thus making Lowes a \"grandfather of the modern weekend\".[19]\n\n\nMcKellen attended Bolton School (Boys' Division),[20] of which he is still a supporter, attending regularly to talk to pupils. McKellen's acting career started at Bolton Little Theatre, of which he is now the patron.[21] An early fascination with the theatre was encouraged by his parents, who took him on a family outing to *Peter Pan* at the Opera House in Manchester when he was three.[11] When he was nine, his main Christmas present was a fold-away wood and bakelite Victorian theatre from Pollocks Toy Theatres, with cardboard scenery and wires to push on the cut-outs of Cinderella and of Laurence Olivier's reenactment of Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\".[11]\n\n\nHis sister took him to his first Shakespeare play, *Twelfth Night*,[22] by the amateurs of Wigan's Little Theatre, shortly followed by their *Macbeth* and Wigan High School for Girls' production of *A Midsummer Night's Dream*, with music by Mendelssohn, with the role of Bottom played by Jean McKellen, who continued to act, direct, and produce amateur theatre until her death.[23]\n\n\nIn 1958, McKellen, at the age of 18, won a scholarship to St Catharine's College, Cambridge, where he read English literature.[24] He has since been made an Honorary Fellow of the college. While at Cambridge, McKellen was a member of the Marlowe Society, where he appeared in 23 plays over the course of 3 years. At that young age he was already giving performances that have since become legendary such as his Justice Shallow in *Henry IV* alongside Trevor Nunn and Derek Jacobi (March 1959), *Cymbeline* (as Posthumus, opposite Margaret Drabble as Imogen) and *Doctor Faustus*.[25][26][27] During this period McKellen had already been directed by Peter Hall, John Barton and Dadie Rylands, all of whom would have a significant impact on McKellen's future career.[28]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 1965–1985: National Theatre acclaim[edit]\n\n\n![](image)McKellen (Antonio Salieri) alongside Jane Seymour (Constanze Mozart) in *Amadeus*, c. 1981\nMcKellen made his first professional appearance in 1961 at the Belgrade Theatre in Coventry, as Roper in *A Man for All Seasons*, although an audio recording of the Marlowe Society's *Cymbeline* had gone on commercial sale as part of the Argo Shakespeare series.[25][27] After four years in regional repertory theatres, McKellen made his first West End appearance, in *A Scent of Flowers*, regarded as a \"notable success\".[25] In 1965 he was a member of Laurence Olivier's National Theatre Company at the Old Vic, which led to roles at the Chichester Festival. With the Prospect Theatre Company, McKellen made his breakthrough performances of Shakespeare's *Richard II* (directed by Richard Cottrell) and Christopher Marlowe's *Edward II* (directed by Toby Robertson) at the Edinburgh Festival in 1969, the latter causing a storm of protest over the enactment of the homosexual Edward's lurid death.[29]\n\n\nOne of McKellen's first major roles on television was as the title character in the BBC's 1966 adaptation of *David Copperfield*, which achieved 12 million viewers on its initial airings. After some rebroadcasting in the late 60s, the master videotapes for the serial were wiped, and only four scattered episodes (3, 8, 9 and 11) survive as telerecordings, three of which feature McKellen as adult David. McKellen had taken film roles throughout his career—beginning in 1969 with his role of George Matthews in *A Touch of Love*, and his first leading role was in 1980 as D. H. Lawrence in *Priest of Love*,[30] but it was not until the 1990s that he became more widely recognised in this medium after several roles in blockbuster Hollywood films.[24] In 1969, McKellen starred in three films, Michael Hayes's *The Promise*, Clive Donner's epic film *Alfred the Great*, and Waris Hussein's *A Touch of Love* (1969).\n\n\nIn the 1970s, McKellen became a well-known figure in British theatre, performing frequently at the Royal Shakespeare Company and the Royal National Theatre, where he played several leading Shakespearean roles. From 1973 to 1974, McKellen toured the United Kingdom and Brooklyn Academy of Music portraying Lady Wishfort's Footman, Kruschov, and Edgar in the William Congreve comedy *The Way of the World*, Anton Chekov's comedic three-act play *The Wood Demon* and William Shakespeare tragedy *King Lear*. The following year, he starred in Shakespeare's *King John*, George Colman's *The Clandestine Marriage*, and George Bernard Shaw's *Too True to Be Good*. From 1976 to 1977 he portrayed Romeo in the Shakespeare romance *Romeo & Juliet* at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre. The following year he played King Leontes in *The Winter's Tale*.[31]\n\n\nIn 1976, McKellen played the title role in William Shakespeare's *Macbeth* at Stratford in a \"gripping ... out of the ordinary\" production, with Judi Dench, and Iago in *Othello*, in award-winning productions directed by Trevor Nunn.[25] Both of these productions were adapted into television films, also directed by Nunn. From 1978 to 1979 he toured in a double feature production of Shakespeare's *Twelfth Night*, and Anton Chekov's *Three Sisters* portraying Sir Toby Belch and Andrei, respectively.[32] In 1979, McKellen gained acclaim for his role as Antonio Salieri in the Broadway transfer production of Peter Shaffer's play *Amadeus*. It was an immensely popular play produced by the National Theatre originally starring Paul Scofield. The transfer starred McKellen, Tim Curry as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and Jane Seymour as Constanze Mozart. *The New York Times* theatre critic Frank Rich wrote of McKellen's performance \"In Mr. McKellen's superb performance, Salieri's descent into madness was portrayed in dark notes of almost bone-rattling terror\".[33] For his performance, McKellen received the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play.[34]\n\n\nIn 1981, McKellen portrayed writer and poet D. H. Lawrence in the Christopher Miles directed biographical film, *Priest of Love*. He followed up with Michael Mann's horror film *The Keep* (1983). In 1985, he starred in *Plenty*, the film adaptation of the David Hare play of the same name. The film was directed by Fred Schepisi and starred Meryl Streep, Charles Dance, John Gielgud, and Sting. The film spans nearly 20 years from the early 1940s to the 1960s, around an Englishwoman's experiences as a fighter for the French Resistance during World War II when she has a one-night stand with a British intelligence agent. The film received mixed reviews with Roger Ebert of *The Chicago Sun-Times* praising the film's ensemble cast writing, \"The performances in the movie supply one brilliant solo after another; most of the big moments come as characters dominate the scenes they are in\".[35]\n\n\n\n### 1986–2000: Established actor[edit]\n\n\nIn 1986, he returned to Broadway in the revival of Anton Chekhov's first play *Wild Honey* alongside Kim Cattrall and Kate Burton. The play concerned a local Russian schoolteacher who struggles to remain faithful to his wife, despite the attention of three other women. McKellen received mixed reviews from critics in particular Frank Rich of *The New York Times* who praised him for his \"bravura and athletically graceful technique that provides everything except, perhaps, the thing that matters most—sustained laughter\". He later wrote, \"Mr. McKellen finds himself in the peculiar predicament of the star who strains to carry a frail supporting cast\".[36] In 1989 he played Iago in production of *Othello* by the Royal Shakespeare Company.[37] McKellen starred in the British drama *Scandal* (1989) a fictionalised account of the Profumo affair that rocked the government of British prime minister Harold Macmillan. McKellen portrayed John Profumo. The film starred Joanne Whalley, and John Hurt. The film premiered at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival and competed for the Palme d'Or. When his friend and colleague, Patrick Stewart, decided to accept the role of Captain Jean-Luc Picard in the American television series, *Star Trek: The Next Generation*, McKellan strongly advised him not to throw away his respected theatrical career to work in television. However, McKellan later conceded that Stewart had been prudent in accepting the role, which made him a global star and later followed his example such as co-starring with Stewart in the *X-Men* superhero film series.[38]\n\n\nFrom 1990 to 1992, he acted in a world tour of a lauded revival of *Richard III*, playing the title character. The production played at the Brooklyn Academy of Music for two weeks before continuing its tour where Frank Rich of *New York Times* was able to review it. In his piece, he praised McKellen's performance writing, \"Mr McKellen's highly sophisticated sense of theatre and fun drives him to reveal the secrets of how he pulls his victims' strings whether he is addressing the audience in a soliloquy or not\".[39] For his performance he received the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor.[40]\n\n\nIn 1992, he acted in Pam Gems's revival of Chekov's *Uncle Vanya* at the Royal National Theatre alongside Antony Sher, and Janet McTeer. In 1993, he starred in the film *Six Degrees of Separation* based on the Pulitzer Prize and Tony Award nominated play of the same name. McKellen starred alongside Will Smith, Donald Sutherland and Stockard Channing. The film was a critical success. That same year, he also appeared in the western *The Ballad of Little Jo* opposite Bob Hoskins and the action comedy *Last Action Hero* starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. The following year, he appeared in the superhero film *The Shadow* with Alec Baldwin and the James L. Brooks directed comedy *I'll Do Anything* starring Nick Nolte. \n\n\nIn 1995, McKellen made his screenwriting debut with *Richard III*, an ambitious adaptation of William Shakespeare's play of the same name, directed by Richard Loncraine.[41][42] The film reimagines the play's story and characters to a setting based on 1930s Britain, with Richard depicted as a fascist plotting to usurp the throne. McKellen stars in the title role alongside an ensemble cast including Annette Bening, Robert Downey Jr., Jim Broadbent, Kristen Scott Thomas, Nigel Hawthorne and Dame Maggie Smith. As executive producer he returned his £50,000 fee to complete the filming of the final battle.[43] In his review of the film, *The Washington Post* film critic Hal Hinson called McKellen's performance a \"lethally flamboyant incarnation\" and said his \"florid mastery ... dominates everything\".[44] Film critic Roger Ebert of the *Chicago Sun-Times* praised McKellen's adaptation and his performance in his four star review writing, \"McKellen has a deep sympathy for the playwright ... Here he brings to Shakespeare's most tortured villain a malevolence we are moved to pity. No man should be so evil, and know it. Hitler and others were more evil, but denied out to themselves. There is no escape for Richard. He is one of the first self-aware characters in the theatre, and for that distinction he must pay the price\".[45] His performance in the title role garnered BAFTA and Golden Globe nominations for Best Actor and won the European Film Award for Best Actor. His screenplay was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. That same year, he appeared in the historical drama *Restoration* (1995) also starring Downey Jr., as well as Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant, and David Thewlis. He also appeared in the British romantic comedy *Jack and Sarah* (1995) starring Richard E. Grant, Samantha Mathis, and Judi Dench.\n\n\nIn 1993, he appeared in minor roles in the television miniseries *Tales of the City*, based on the novel by his friend Armistead Maupin. Later that year, McKellen appeared in the HBO television film *And the Band Played On* based on the acclaimed novel of the same name about the discovery of HIV. For his performance as gay rights activist Bill Kraus, McKellen received the CableACE Award for Supporting Actor in a Movie or Miniseries and was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie.[46] From 1993 to 1997 McKellen toured in a one-man show entitled, *A Knights Out*, about coming out as a gay man. Laurie Winer from *The Los Angeles Times* wrote, \"Even if he is preaching to the converted, McKellen makes us aware of the vast and powerful intolerance outside the comfortable walls of the theatre. Endowed with a rare technique, he is a natural storyteller, an admirable human being and a hands-on activist\".[47] From 1997 to 1998, he starred as Dr. Tomas Stockmann in a revival of Henrik Ibsen's *An Enemy of the People*.[48] Later that year he played Garry Essendine in the Noël Coward comedy *Present Laughter* at the West Yorkshire Playhouse.[49] In 1998, he appeared in the modestly acclaimed psychological thriller *Apt Pupil*, which was directed by Bryan Singer and based on a story by Stephen King.[50] McKellen portrayed a fugitive Nazi officer living under a false name in the US who is befriended by a curious teenager (Brad Renfro) who threatens to expose him unless he tells his story in detail. That same year, he played James Whale, the director of *Frankenstein* in the Bill Condon directed period drama *Gods and Monsters*, a role for which he was subsequently nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor, losing it to Roberto Benigni in *Life is Beautiful* (1998).[24]\n\n\nIn 1995, he appeared in the BBC television comedy film *Cold Comfort Farm* starring Kate Beckinsale, Rufus Sewell, and Stephen Fry. The following year he starred as Tsar Nicholas II in the HBO made-for-television movie *Rasputin: Dark Servant of Destiny* (1996) starring Alan Rickman as Rasputin. For his performance, McKellen earned a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie nomination and received a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film win. McKellen appeared as Mr Creakle in the BBC series *David Copperfield* (1999) based on the Charles Dickens classic novel. The miniseries starred a pre-*Harry Potter* Daniel Radcliffe, Bob Hoskins, and Dame Maggie Smith.\n\n\n\n### 2000–2011: International stardom[edit]\n\n\n![](image)McKellen at the world premiere of *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* in Wellington, 1 December 2003\nIn 1999, McKellen was cast, again under the direction of Bryan Singer, to play the comic book supervillain Magneto in the 2000 film *X-Men* and its sequels *X2: X-Men United* (2003) and *X-Men: The Last Stand* (2006).[24] He later reprised his role of Magneto in 2014's *X-Men: Days of Future Past*, sharing the role with Michael Fassbender, who played a younger version of the character in 2011's *X-Men: First Class*.[51]\n\n\nWhile filming the first *X-Men* film in 1999, McKellen was cast as the wizard Gandalf in Peter Jackson's film trilogy adaptation of *The Lord of the Rings* (consisting of *The Fellowship of the Ring*, *The Two Towers*, and *The Return of the King*), released between 2001 and 2003. He won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture for his work in *The Fellowship of the Ring* and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the same role. He provided the voice of Gandalf for several video game adaptations of the *Lord of the Rings* films.[52]\n\n\nMcKellen returned to the Broadway stage in 2001 in an August Strindberg play *The Dance of Death* alongside Helen Mirren, and David Strathairn at the Broadhurst Theatre. *The New York Times* Theatre critic Ben Brantley praised McKellen's performance writing, \"[McKellen] returns to Broadway to serve up an Elysian concoction we get to sample too little these days: a mixture of heroic stage presence, actorly intelligence, and rarefied theatrical technique\".[53] McKellen toured with the production at the Lyric Theatre in London's West End and to the Sydney Art's Festival in Australia. On 16 March 2002, he hosted *Saturday Night Live*. In 2003, McKellen made a guest appearance as himself on the American cartoon show *The Simpsons* in a special British-themed episode entitled \"The Regina Monologues\", along with the then UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and author J. K. Rowling. In April and May 2005, he played the role of Mel Hutchwright in Granada Television's long-running British soap opera, *Coronation Street*, fulfilling a lifelong ambition. He narrated Richard Bell's film *Eighteen* as a grandfather who leaves his World War II memoirs on audio-cassette for his teenage grandson.\n\n\n\n![](image)McKellen with Kate Winslet at the 60th British Academy Film Awards in 2007\nMcKellen has appeared in limited release films, such as *Emile* (which was shot in three weeks following the *X2* shoot),[54] *Neverwas* and *Asylum*. In 2006, he appeared as Sir Leigh Teabing in *The Da Vinci Code* opposite Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon. During a 17 May 2006 interview on *The Today Show* with the *Da Vinci Code* cast and director Ron Howard, Matt Lauer posed a question to the group about how they would have felt if the film had borne a prominent disclaimer that it is a work of fiction, as some religious groups wanted.[55] McKellen responded, \"I've often thought the Bible should have a disclaimer in the front saying 'This is fiction'. I mean, walking on water? It takes ... an act of faith. And I have faith in this movie—not that it's true, not that it's factual, but that it's a jolly good story\". He continued, \"And I think audiences are clever enough and bright enough to separate out fact and fiction, and discuss the thing when they've seen it\".[55]\n\n\nMcKellen appeared in the 2006 BBC series of Ricky Gervais's comedy series *Extras*, where he played himself directing Gervais's character Andy Millman in a play about gay lovers. McKellen received a 2007 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor – Comedy Series nomination for his performance. In 2007, McKellen narrated the romantic fantasy adventure film *Stardust* starring Charlie Cox and Claire Danes, which was a critical and financial success. That same year, he lent his voice to the armored bear Iorek Byrnison in the Chris Weitz-directed fantasy film *The Golden Compass* based on the acclaimed Philip Pullman novel *Northern Lights* and starred Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig. The film received mixed reviews but was a financial success.\n\n\n\n![](image)McKellen at the 2007 BAFTA Awards\nIn 2007, he returned to the Royal Shakespeare Company, in productions of *King Lear* and *The Seagull*, both directed by Trevor Nunn. In 2009 he portrayed Number Two in *The Prisoner*, a remake of the 1967 cult series *The Prisoner*.[56] In 2009, he appeared in a very popular revival of *Waiting for Godot* at London's Haymarket Theatre, directed by Sean Mathias, and playing opposite Patrick Stewart.[57][58] From 2013 to 2014, McKellen and Stewart starred in a double production of Samuel Beckett's *Waiting for Godot* and Harold Pinter's *No Man's Land* on Broadway at the Cort Theatre. *Variety* theatre critic Marilyn Stasio praised the dual production writing, \"McKellen and Stewart find plenty of consoling comedy in two masterpieces of existential despair\".[59] In both productions of Stasio claims, \"the two thespians play the parts they were meant to play\".[59] He is Patron of English Touring Theatre and also President and Patron of the Little Theatre Guild of Great Britain, an association of amateur theatre organisations throughout the UK.[60] In late August 2012, he took part in the opening ceremony of the London Paralympics, portraying Prospero from *The Tempest*.[61]\n\n\n\n### 2012–present: Career expansion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)McKellen with Billy Crudup and Patrick Stewart promoting *Waiting for Godot* and *No Man's Land* (2013)\nMcKellen reprised the role of Gandalf on screen in Peter Jackson's three-part film adaptation of *The Hobbit* starting with *The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey* (2012), followed by *The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug* (2013), and finally *The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies* (2014).[62] Despite the series receiving mixed reviews, it emerged as a financial success. McKellen also reprised his role as Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto in James Mangold's *The Wolverine* (2013), and Singer's *X-Men: Days of Future Past* (2014). In November 2013, McKellen appeared in the *Doctor Who* 50th anniversary comedy homage *The Five(ish) Doctors Reboot*.[63] From 2013 to 2016, McKellen co-starred in the ITV sitcom *Vicious* as Freddie Thornhill, alongside Derek Jacobi. The series revolves around an elderly gay couple who have been together for 50 years.[64][65] The show's original title was \"Vicious Old Queens\". There are ongoing jokes about McKellen's career as a relatively unsuccessful character actor who owns a tux because he stole it after doing a guest spot on \"Downton Abbey\" and that he holds the title of \"10th Most Popular ‘Doctor Who’ Villain\". Liz Shannon Miller of *IndieWire* noted while the concept seemed, \"weird as hell\", that \"Once you come to accept McKellen and Jacobi in a multi-camera format, there is a lot to respect about their performances; specifically, the way that those decades of classical training adapt themselves to the sitcom world. Much has been written before about how the tradition of the multi-cam, filmed in front of a studio audience, relates to theatre, and McKellen and Jacobi know how to play to a live crowd\".[66]\n\n\nIn 2015, McKellen reunited with director Bill Condon playing an elderly Sherlock Holmes in the mystery film *Mr. Holmes* alongside Laura Linney. In the film based on the novel *A Slight Trick of the Mind* (2005), Holmes now 93, struggles to recall the details of his final case because his mind is slowly deteriorating. The film premiered at the 65th Berlin International Film Festival with McKellen receiving acclaim for his performance. *Rolling Stone* film critic Peter Travers praised his performance writing, \"Don't think you can take another Hollywood version of Sherlock Holmes? Snap out of it. Apologies to Robert Downey Jr. and Benedict Cumberbatch, but what Ian McKellen does with Arthur Conan Doyle's fictional detective in Mr Holmes is nothing short of magnificent ... Director Bill Condon, who teamed superbly with McKellen on the Oscar-winning Gods and Monsters, brings us a riveting character study of a lion not going gentle into winter\".[67] In October 2015, McKellen appeared as Norman to Anthony Hopkins's Sir in a BBC Two production of Ronald Harwood's *The Dresser*, alongside Edward Fox, Vanessa Kirby, and Emily Watson.[68] Television critic Tim Goodman of *The Hollywood Reporter* praised the film and the central performances writing, \"there's no escaping that Hopkins and McKellen are the central figures here, giving wonderfully nuanced performances, onscreen together for their first time in their acclaimed careers\".[69] For his performance McKellen received a British Academy Television Award nomination for his performance.\n\n\n\n![](image)McKellen in 2019\nIn 2017, McKellen portrayed in a supporting role as Cogsworth (originally voiced by David Ogden Stiers in the 1991 animated film) in the live-action adaptation of Disney's *Beauty and the Beast*, directed by Bill Condon (which marked the third collaboration between Condon and McKellen, after *Gods and Monsters* and *Mr. Holmes*) and co-starred alongside Emma Watson and Dan Stevens.[70] The film was released to positive reviews and grossed $1.2 billion worldwide, making it the highest-grossing live-action musical film, the second highest-grossing film of 2017, and the 17th highest-grossing film of all time.[71][72][73] In 2017, McKellen appeared in the documentary *McKellen: Playing the Part*, directed by director Joe Stephenson. The documentary explores McKellen's life and career as an actor.\n\n\nIn October 2017, McKellen played King Lear at the Chichester Festival Theatre, a role which he said was likely to be his \"last big Shakespearean part\".[74] He performed the play at the Duke of York's Theatre in London's West End during the summer of 2018.[75][76] To celebrate his 80th birthday, in 2019 McKellen performed in a one-man stage show titled *Ian McKellen on Stage: With Tolkien, Shakespeare, Others and YOU* celebrating the various performances throughout his career. The show toured across the UK and Ireland (raising money for each venue and organisation's charity) before a West End run at the Harold Pinter Theatre and was performed for one night only on Broadway at the Hudson Theatre.[77]\n\n\nThe following year, he appeared in Kenneth Branagh's historical drama *All is True* (2018) portraying Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton, opposite Branagh and Judi Dench. In 2019, he reunited with Condon for a fourth time in the mystery thriller *The Good Liar* opposite Helen Mirren, who received praise for their onscreen chemistry.[78] That same year, he appeared as Gus the Theatre Cat in the movie musical adaptation of *Cats* directed by Tom Hooper. The film featured performances from Jennifer Hudson, James Corden, Rebel Wilson, Idris Elba, and Judi Dench. The film was widely panned for its poor visual effects, editing, performances, screenplay, and was a box office disaster.[79] In 2021, he played the title role in an age-blind production of *Hamlet* (having previously played the part in a UK and European tour in 1971), followed by the role of Firs in Chekov's *The Cherry Orchard* at the Theatre Royal, Windsor.[80][81]\n\n\nIn 2023 he is set to star in period thriller *The Critic* directed by Anand Tucker. The film is written by Patrick Marber adapted off the 2015 novel *Curtain Call* by Anthony Quinn. The film will premiere at the 2023 Toronto International Film Festival.[82]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nMcKellen and his first partner, Brian Taylor, a history teacher from Bolton, began their relationship in 1964.[83] Their relationship lasted for eight years, ending in 1972.[84] They lived in Earls Terrace, Kensington, London, where McKellen continued to pursue his career as an actor.[84] In 1978 he met his second partner, Sean Mathias, at the Edinburgh Festival. This relationship lasted until 1988, and according to Mathias, it was tempestuous, with conflicts over McKellen's success in acting versus Mathias's somewhat less-successful career. The two remained friends, with Mathias later directing McKellen in *Waiting for Godot* at the Theatre Royal Haymarket in 2009. The pair entered into a business partnership with Evgeny Lebedev, purchasing the lease of The Grapes public house in Narrow Street.[85] As of 2005, McKellen had been living in Narrow Street, Limehouse, for more than 25 years, more than a decade of which had been spent in a five-storey Victorian conversion.[86]\n\n\nMcKellen is an atheist.[87] In the late 1980s, he lost his appetite for every kind of meat but fish, and has since followed a mainly pescetarian diet.[88] In 2001, Ian McKellen received the Artist Citizen of the World Award (France).[89]\n\n\nMcKellen has a tattoo of the Elvish number nine, written using J. R. R. Tolkien's constructed script of Tengwar, on his shoulder in reference to his involvement in the *Lord of the Rings* and the fact that his character was one of the original nine companions of the Fellowship of the Ring. All but one of the other actors of \"The Fellowship\" (Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Orlando Bloom, Billy Boyd, Sean Bean, Dominic Monaghan and Viggo Mortensen) have the same tattoo (John Rhys-Davies did not get the tattoo, but his stunt double Brett Beattie did).[90][91]\n\n\nMcKellen was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2006.[92] In 2012, he stated on his blog that \"There is no cause for alarm. I am examined regularly and the cancer is contained. I've not needed any treatment\".[93]\n\n\nMcKellen became an ordained minister of the Universal Life Church in early 2013[94] in order to preside over the marriage of his friend and *X-Men* co-star Patrick Stewart to the singer Sunny Ozell.[95]\n\n\nMcKellen was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Letters by Cambridge University on 18 June 2014.[96] He was made a Freeman of the City of London on Thursday 30 October 2014. The ceremony took place at Guildhall in London. He was nominated by London's Lord Mayor Fiona Woolf, who said he was an \"exceptional actor\" and \"tireless campaigner for equality\".[97] He is also an Emeritus Fellow of St Catherine's College, Oxford.[98]\n\n\n\n## Activism[edit]\n\n\n### LGBT rights[edit]\n\n\n![](image)McKellen at Manchester Pride 2010\nWhile McKellen had made his sexual orientation known to fellow actors early on in his stage career, it was not until 1988 that he came out to the general public while appearing on the BBC Radio programme *Third Ear* hosted by conservative journalist Peregrine Worsthorne.[99] The context that prompted McKellen's decision, overriding any concerns about a possible negative effect on his career, was that the controversial Section 28 of the Local Government Bill, known simply as Section 28, was then under consideration in the British Parliament.[24] Section 28 proposed prohibiting local authorities from promoting homosexuality \"... as a kind of pretended family relationship\".[100][24][101] McKellen has stated that he was influenced in his decision by the advice and support of his friends, among them noted gay author Armistead Maupin.[24] In a 1998 interview that discusses the 29th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, McKellen commented, \n\n\n> I have many regrets about not having come out earlier, but one of them might be that I didn't engage myself in the politicking.[102]\n> \n> \n\n He has said of this period: \n\n\n> My own participating in that campaign was a focus for people [to] take comfort that if Ian McKellen was on board for this, perhaps it would be all right for other people to be as well, gay and straight.[17]\n> \n> \n\n Section 28 was, however, enacted and remained on the statute books until 2000 in Scotland and 2003 in England and Wales. Section 28 never applied in Northern Ireland.\n\n\nIn 2003, during an appearance on *Have I Got News For You*, McKellen claimed when he visited Michael Howard, then Environment Secretary (responsible for local government), in 1988 to lobby against Section 28, Howard refused to change his position but did ask him to leave an autograph for his children. McKellen agreed, but wrote, \"Fuck off, I'm gay\".[103][104] McKellen described Howard's junior ministers, Conservatives David Wilshire and Jill Knight, who were the architects of Section 28, as the 'ugly sisters' of a political pantomime.[105]\n\n\n\n![](image)McKellen at Europride 2003 in Manchester\nMcKellen has continued to be very active in LGBT rights efforts. In a statement on his website regarding his activism, the actor commented:\n\n\n\n\n> I have been reluctant to lobby on other issues I most care about—nuclear weapons (against), religion (atheist), capital punishment (anti), AIDS (fund-raiser) because I never want to be forever spouting, diluting the impact of addressing my most urgent concern; legal and social equality for gay people worldwide.[106]\n> \n> \n\n\nMcKellen is a co-founder of Stonewall, an LGBT rights lobby group in the United Kingdom, named after the Stonewall riots.[6] McKellen is also patron of LGBT History Month,[7] Pride London, Oxford Pride, GAY-GLOS, LGBT Foundation[8] and FFLAG where he appears in their video \"Parents Talking\".[107]\n\n\nIn 1994, at the closing ceremony of the Gay Games, he briefly took the stage to address the crowd, saying, \"I'm Sir Ian McKellen, but you can call me Serena\": This nickname, given to him by Stephen Fry, had been circulating within the gay community since McKellen's knighthood was conferred.[17] In 2002, he was the Celebrity Grand Marshal of the San Francisco Pride Parade[108] and he attended the Academy Awards with his then-boyfriend, New Zealander Nick Cuthell. In 2006, McKellen spoke at the pre-launch of the 2007 LGBT History Month in the UK, lending his support to the organisation and its founder, Sue Sanders.[7] In 2007, he became a patron of The Albert Kennedy Trust, an organisation that provides support to young, homeless and troubled LGBT people.[6]\n\n\n\nIn 2006, he became a patron of Oxford Pride, stating:\n\n\n> I send my love to all members of Oxford Pride, their sponsors and supporters, of which I am proud to be one ... Onlookers can be impressed by our confidence and determination to be ourselves and gay people, of whatever age, can be comforted by the occasion to take the first steps towards coming out and leaving the closet forever behind.[109]\n> \n> \n\n\nMcKellen has taken his activism internationally, and caused a major stir in Singapore, where he was invited to do an interview on a morning show and shocked the interviewer by asking if they could recommend him a gay bar; the programme immediately ended.[110] In December 2008, he was named in *Out*'s annual Out 100 list.[111]\n\n\nIn 2010, McKellen extended his support for Liverpool's Homotopia festival in which a group of gay and lesbian Merseyside teenagers helped to produce an anti-homophobia campaign pack for schools and youth centres across the city.[112] In May 2011, he called Sergey Sobyanin, Moscow's mayor, a \"coward\" for refusing to allow gay parades in the city.[113]\n\n\nIn 2014, he was named in the top 10 on the World Pride Power list.[114]\n\n\n\n### Charity work[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2010, along with actors Brian Cox and Eleanor Bron, McKellen appeared in a series of TV advertisements to support Age UK, the charity recently formed from the merger of Age Concern and Help the Aged. All three actors gave their time free of charge.[115]\n\n\nA cricket fan since childhood, McKellen umpired in March 2011 for a charity cricket match in New Zealand to support earthquake victims of the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake.[116][117]\n\n\nMcKellen is an honorary board member for the New York- and Washington, D.C.-based organization Only Make Believe.[118] Only Make Believe creates and performs interactive plays in children's hospitals and care facilities. He was honoured by the organisation in 2012[119] and hosted their annual Make Believe on Broadway Gala in November 2013.[120] He garnered publicity for the organisation by stripping down to his Lord of the Rings underwear on stage.\n\n\nMcKellen also has a history of supporting individual theatres. While in New Zealand filming *The Hobbit* in 2012, he announced a special New Zealand tour \"Shakespeare, Tolkien and You!\", with proceeds going to help save the Isaac Theatre Royal, which suffered extensive damage during the 2011 Christchurch earthquake. McKellen said he opted to help save the building as it was the last theatre he played in New Zealand (*Waiting for Godot* in 2010) and the locals' love for it made it a place worth supporting.[121] In July 2017, he performed a new one-man show for a week at Park Theatre (London), donating the proceeds to the theatre.[122]\n\n\nTogether with a number of his *Lord of the Rings* co-stars (plus writer Philippa Boyens and director Peter Jackson), on 1 June 2020 McKellen joined Josh Gad's YouTube series *Reunited Apart* which reunites the cast of popular movies through video-conferencing, and promotes donations to non-profit charities.[123]\n\n\n\n### Other work[edit]\n\n\nA friend of Ian Charleson and an admirer of his work, McKellen contributed an entire chapter to *For Ian Charleson: A Tribute*.[124] A recording of McKellen's voice is heard before performances at the Royal Festival Hall, reminding patrons to ensure their mobile phones and watch alarms are switched off and to keep coughing to a minimum.[125][126] He also took part in the 2012 Summer Paralympics opening ceremony in London as Prospero from Shakespeare's *The Tempest*.[61]\n\n\n\n## Acting credits[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ian McKellen on screen and stage\n\n## Accolades and honours[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of awards and nominations received by Ian McKellen\n\n![](image)The hands of McKellen on a 1999 *Gods and Monsters* plaque in London's Leicester Square\nMcKellen has received two Academy Award nominations for his performances in *Gods and Monsters* (1999), and *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring* (2001).

She began a modeling career at age 14 before making her film debut in *Silent Fall* (1994); she went on to achieve critical recognition with starring roles in *Heavy* and *Empire Records* (both 1995), as well as *That Thing You Do!* and *Stealing Beauty* (both 1996). She then appeared in films such as *Inventing the Abbotts* (1997), *Armageddon* (1998), *Cookie's Fortune* and *Onegin* (both 1999), *Dr. T & the Women* (2000), and *One Night at McCool's* (2001). She then played the elf Arwen Undómiel in the *Lord of the Rings* film trilogy (2001–2003), which became one of the highest-grossing film series in history.\n\n\nFollowing the success of *Lord of the Rings*, Tyler has appeared in a variety of roles, including the films *Jersey Girl* (2004), *Lonesome Jim* (2005), *Reign Over Me* (2007), *The Strangers*, *The Incredible Hulk* (both 2008), *Robot & Frank* (2012), *Space Station 76* (2014), *Wildling* (2018), and *Ad Astra* (2019). Outside of film, she starred in the HBO supernatural drama series *The Leftovers* (2014–2017), the BBC period drama series *Gunpowder* (2017), the ITV/Hulu period drama series *Harlots* (2018–2019) and the Fox procedural drama series *9-1-1: Lone Star* (2020).\n\n\nTyler is also a singer. Having sung with composer Howard Shore, she appeared as guest vocalist on The Lemonheads' album *Varshons* (2009) singing a cover of the Leonard Cohen song \"Hey, That's No Way to Say Goodbye\". She appeared on the 2017 bonus disk of Evan Dando's album *Baby I'm Bored* (2003) providing featured vocals for the song \"Shots Is Fired\". In 2011, she released her debut single, \"Need You Tonight\".\n\n\nTyler has served as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador for the United States since 2003, and as a spokesperson for Givenchy's line of perfume and cosmetics. She is the daughter of Steven Tyler and Bebe Buell, although she has a very close relationship with her adoptive father Todd Rundgren.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nTyler was born Liv Rundgren[2] on July 1, 1977, in New York City at Mount Sinai Hospital.[3] She is the only daughter of Bebe Buell, a model, singer, and former *Playboy* Playmate (Miss November 1974), and Steven Tyler, the lead singer of Aerosmith.[4] Her mother named her after Norwegian actress Liv Ullmann, after seeing Ullmann on the cover of the March 5, 1977, issue of *TV Guide*.[3][5]\n\n\nHer ancestry includes Italian (from her great-grandfather), Polish, German, English[6][7] and African-American (from her paternal great-great-great-great-grandfather).[8] Tyler has three half-siblings: Mia Tyler (born 1978),[9] Chelsea Anna Tyler Foster (née Tallarico; born 1989), and Taj Monroe Tallarico (born 1991).[10] Her maternal grandmother, Dorothea Johnson, founded the Protocol School of Washington.[11]\n\n\nFrom 1972 to 1979, Buell lived with rock musician Todd Rundgren. In 1976, Buell became pregnant from a brief relationship with Steven Tyler. She gave birth on July 1, 1977, naming the daughter Liv Rundgren and claiming that Todd Rundgren was the biological father because Tyler was in the middle of his well-documented drug excesses. Liv told *People Magazine* in 1992 that \"Todd's my spiritual father. I love him\".[2] By then Rundgren and Buell had ended their romantic relationship but Rundgren nevertheless signed the birth certificate and acted as a father figure to Liv, including paying for her education.[12]\n\n\nAt age 10 or 11, Liv met Steven Tyler and suspected he was her father when she observed the resemblance between him and herself.[5][13] When she asked her mother, the secret was revealed.[13] The truth about Tyler's paternity did not become public until 1991, when she changed her surname from Rundgren to Tyler,[4] but kept Rundgren as a middle name.[14] Buell's stated reason for claiming that Rundgren was Liv's father was that Steven Tyler was too heavily addicted to drugs at the time of Liv's birth.[4] Since learning the truth about her paternity, Liv and Steven have developed a close relationship. They also have worked together professionally, once when she appeared in Aerosmith's music video for \"Crazy\" in 1993, and again when Aerosmith performed songs in the film *Armageddon* (1998), in which Liv starred. Tyler maintains a close relationship with Rundgren. \"I'm so grateful to him, I have so much love for him. You know, when he holds me it feels like Daddy. And he's very protective and strong.\"[15]\n\n\nTyler attended the Congressional School of Virginia, Breakwater School, and Waynflete School in Portland, Maine,[16][17][18] before returning to New York City with her mother at age 12.[2][5] She went to York Preparatory in New York City for junior high and high school after her mother researched the school to accommodate Tyler's ADHD.[19] She also attended the Crossroads School for Arts & Sciences in Santa Monica, California.[20] She graduated from York in 1995 and left to continue her acting career.[2][5] When asked about her youth, Tyler said: \"For me, I didn't get much of a childhood in my teen years because I've been working since I was 14. But that also kept me out of trouble. When everybody was doing acid and partying like crazy, I was at work on a movie in Tuscany ... having my own fun, of course, but it was a different kind of thing. I have no regrets. I love the way my life has gone.\"[21]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 1991–1997: Early work[edit]\n\n\nTyler received her first modeling job at 14 with the assistance of Paulina Porizkova, who took pictures of her that ended up in *Interview* magazine.[2][5] She later starred in television commercials.[2][5] She became bored with her modeling career less than a year after it started and decided to go into acting, although[5] she never took acting lessons.[4] Tyler first became known to television audiences when she starred alongside Alicia Silverstone in the music video for Aerosmith's 1993 song \"Crazy\".[2]\n\n\nTyler made her feature film debut in *Silent Fall* in 1994, where she played the elder sister of a boy with autism.[22] In 1995, she starred in the comedy-drama *Empire Records*.[23] Tyler has described *Empire Records* as \"one of the best experiences\" she has ever had.[24] Soon after, she landed a supporting role in James Mangold's 1995 drama *Heavy* as Callie, a naive young waitress. The film received favorable reviews;[25] critic Janet Maslin noted: \"Ms. Tyler ... gives a charmingly ingenuous performance, betraying no self-consciousness about her lush good looks.\"[26]\n\n\nTyler's breakthrough role was in the arthouse film *Stealing Beauty* (1996), in which she played Lucy Harmon, an innocent, romantic teenager who travels to Tuscany, Italy, intent on losing her virginity. The film received generally mixed reviews,[27] but Tyler's performance was regarded favorably by critics. *Variety* wrote: \"Tyler is the perfect accomplice. At times sweetly awkward, at others composed and serene, the actress appears to respond effortlessly and intuitively to the camera, creating a rich sense of what Lucy is about that often is not explicit in the dialogue.\"[28] *Empire* noted, \"Liv Tyler (here radiantly resembling a ganglier young Ava Gardner) with a rare opportunity to enamour, a break she capitalizes on with composure.\"[29] The film was directed by Bernardo Bertolucci, who chose Tyler for the role after meeting with a number of young girls in Los Angeles, including Tyler's music video co-star Alicia Silverstone. Bertolucci said \"there was something missing in all of them\".[30] He later said that what he saw in Tyler was a *gravitas* he described as \"a New York aura\".[30] During promotion of the film, Tyler said she wanted to separate herself from the character during production: \"I tried my damnedest not to think of my own situation. But at one point, after a take, I just started to cry and cry. I remembered when I found out about my dad and how we just stared at each other from head to toe taking in every nook and cranny.\"[30]\n\n\nShe later appeared in *That Thing You Do!* (1996), a movie about a fictional one-hit wonder rock band called The Oneders (renamed The Wonders), following their whirlwind rise to the top of the pop charts and, just as quickly, their plunge back to obscurity.[31] The film was written and directed by Tom Hanks.[32] It grossed over $25 million worldwide,[33] and received favorable reviews.[34] In 1997, she appeared in *Inventing the Abbotts* as the daughter of Will Patton and Barbara Williams' characters.[35] The movie is based on a short story by Sue Miller.[36] *Entertainment Weekly* declared Tyler's performance as \"lovely and pliant\".[37] That same year, Tyler was chosen by *People* magazine as one of the 50 Most Beautiful People.[38]\n\n\n\n### 1998–2000: Mainstream exposure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tyler (center) with cast and crew at the premiere of *Armageddon*, at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, 1998\nTyler next appeared in *Armageddon* (1998), where she played the daughter of Bruce Willis' character and love interest of Ben Affleck's character. The film generated mixed reviews,[39] but it was a box office blockbuster, earning $553 million worldwide.[33] The movie included the songs \"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing\" and \"What Kind of Love Are You On\" by Aerosmith.[40] In a 2001 interview with *The Guardian*, she said that she initially turned down the role in *Armageddon:* \"I really didn't want to do it at first and I turned it down a couple of times, but the biggest reason I changed my mind was because I was scared of it. I wanted to try it for that very reason. I mean, I'm not really in this to do amazing things in my career – I just want it to be special when I make a movie.\"[17]\n\n\nShe was then cast in the drama *Onegin* (1999), a film based on the 19th century Russian novel of the same name by Alexander Pushkin, in which she portrayed Tatyana Larina and co-starred with Ralph Fiennes.[41] Tyler was required to master an English accent, though Stephen Holden of *The New York Times* felt that her approximation of an English accent was \"inert\".[42] The film was critically and financially unsuccessful.[33][43] That same year, she appeared in the historical comedy film *Plunkett & Macleane*.[44][45]\n\n\nShe later appeared in two films directed by Robert Altman, *Cookie's Fortune* (1999) and *Dr. T & the Women* (2000).[2][41] In *Cookie's Fortune*, she was part of an ensemble cast that included Glenn Close, Julianne Moore, Chris O'Donnell, and Patricia Neal.[46] Her performance was well received among critics; Salon.com wrote: \"This is the first time in which Tyler's acting is a match for her beauty (she's always been a bit forlorn). Altman helps her find some snap, but a relaxed, silly snap, as in the cartoon sound she makes when she takes a midday swig of bourbon. The lazy geniality of the movie is summed up by the way Emma [Tyler's character] saunters off to take a swim with her cowboy hat and pint of Wild Turkey.\"[47] *Entertainment Weekly* also wrote that Tyler was \"sweetly gruff as the tomboy troublemaker\".[48] In *Dr. T & the Women*, a romantic comedy, she played Marilyn, a gynecological patient of Richard Gere's character and the lesbian lover of his daughter, played by Kate Hudson.[49]\n\n\n\n### 2001–2007: *Lord of the Rings* and international success[edit]\n\n\nIn 2001, Tyler played the object of infatuation for three men (Matt Dillon, John Goodman, and Paul Reiser) in the comedy *One Night at McCool's*.[50] She said the role was \"definitely the first part where I had to be so physically aware and have people so aware of me physically. Maybe it's not hard for anybody else, but it is a bit for me. I mean I love my body and I feel very comfortable in my skin but this was tough.\"[51] Peter Travers of *Rolling Stone* wrote: \"Tyler, a true beauty, gives the role a valiant try, but her range is too limited to play this amalgam of female perfection.\"[52]\n\n\n\n![](image)Tyler at the premiere of *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* in 2003\nIn 2001, she starred in the feature film *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring*, directed by Peter Jackson. She played the Elf maiden Arwen Undómiel.[51][53] The film is based on the first volume of J. R. R. Tolkien's *The Lord of the Rings*. The filmmakers approached Tyler after seeing her performance in *Plunkett & Macleane*.[54] She learned to speak the Elvish language that was created by Tolkien.[55] Mick LaSalle of the *San Francisco Chronicle* said Tyler's performance was \"lovely and earnest\".[56]\n\n\nA year later, Tyler again starred as Arwen in *The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers*, the second installment of the series. The film received favorable reviews.[57] She spent months learning sword fighting for the concluding battle scenes in the film, but her scenes were removed after the script was changed.[58] The film was an enormous box office success, earning over $926 million worldwide[59] and out-grossing its predecessor, which earned over $871 million.[33] In 2003, Tyler featured in the third and last installment of the series, *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King*.[60]\n\n\nFollowing the success of *The Lord of the Rings*, she appeared opposite her *Armageddon* co-star Ben Affleck in writer-director Kevin Smith's romantic comedy *Jersey Girl* (2004), playing a woman who meets a widowed father, played by Affleck, and re-opens his heart to love.[61] In an interview with MTV News, Tyler confessed that she felt \"scared and vulnerable\" while filming *Jersey Girl*, adding \"I was so used to those other elements of the character [Arwen]. On *The Lord of the Rings*, a lot of things were done in post-production, whereas this was really just about me and Ben sitting there, just shooting off dialogue.\"[62]\n\n\nIn 2003, she became the spokesperson for Givenchy perfume and cosmetics,[63][64] and in 2005 the brand named a rose after her, which was used in one of its fragrances.[65] In 2009, she signed on for two more years as Givenchy spokesperson.[66] On December 8, 2011, Givenchy announced a collaboration between Givenchy perfumes and Sony Music.[67] In the video released on February 7, 2012, Tyler covered the INXS song \"Need You Tonight\".[68]\n\n\nIn 2005, she appeared in Steve Buscemi's independent drama *Lonesome Jim*, where she was cast alongside Casey Affleck as a single mother and nurse who reconnects with an old fling who has returned to their small Indiana town after a failed run as a novelist in New York.[62] The film was screened at a special presentation at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival where it was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize.[69] Her next appearance was in a supporting role as an insightful therapist who tries to help a once-successful dentist (Adam Sandler) cope with the loss of his family in the September 11 attacks in *Reign Over Me* (2007).[70][71]\n\n\n\n### 2008–present: Box office hits and *The Leftovers*[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tyler at the premiere for *The Incredible Hulk* in June 2008\n![](image)Tyler at the premiere of *Super*, 2010\nIn 2008, she starred in the home invasion horror film *The Strangers* with Scott Speedman, a film about a young couple who are terrorized one night by three masked assailants in their remote country house.[72][73] Although the film garnered a mixed reception among critics,[74] it was a major box office success, earning more than $80 million over its $9 million budget.[33] In an interview with *Entertainment Weekly*, she said *The Strangers* was the most challenging role of her career. \"It was as far as I could push myself in every way: physically, emotionally, mentally.\"[24]\n\n\nShe appeared in *The Incredible Hulk* (2008), in which she played Dr. Betty Ross, the love interest of the title character, played by Edward Norton.[75] Tyler was a fan of the television show,[76] and was attracted to the love story in the script. She said filming the part was \"very physical, which was fun\",[77] and compared her performance to \"a deer caught in the headlights\".[78] *The Incredible Hulk* was a moderate box office success, earning over $262 million worldwide against a $150 million budget.[33] *The Washington Post*, in review of the film, wrote: \"Tyler gives Betty an appropriately angelic nimbus of ethereal gentleness as the one Beauty who can tame the Beast ... during their most pivotal encounters.\"[79]\n\n\nTyler appeared in two films released in 2011: *Super* and *The Ledge*. In April 2011, publishing house Rodale announced that Tyler and her grandmother Dorothea Johnson, an etiquette expert, had written a book called *Modern Manners*. It was released October 29, 2013.[80]\n\n\nIn 2014, Tyler appeared in *Space Station 76*, a film directed by Jack Plotnick, also starring Matt Bomer and Patrick Wilson, as well as in the independent horror-drama film *Jamie Marks Is Dead*, directed by Carter Smith.[81]\n\n\nIn June 2014, Tyler began appearing as a regular in the HBO television series *The Leftovers*. The series ended after three seasons in 2017.[82]\n\n\nIn 2016, Tyler took on a role opposite Bel Powley in the fantasy/horror drama film *Wildling,* directed by Fritz Böhm. The film also marked her debut as a producer. It was released in 2018.[83]\n\n\nIn 2017, Tyler landed a role as Anne Vaux in the BBC/HBO miniseries *Gunpowder*, co-starring Kit Harington.[84] She later joined the second season of the ITV/Hulu period drama series *Harlots*, starring in the second and third series in a regular role as Lady Isabella Fitzwilliam.[85]\n\n\nIn 2019, Tyler co-starred opposite Brad Pitt in the science fiction drama film *Ad Astra*, which received positive reviews from critics. In 2020, she began a starring role as Michelle Blake in the Fox procedural drama series *9-1-1: Lone Star*, which is a spin-off of the drama series *9-1-1*. On June 1, 2020, Tyler – together with her *Lord of the Rings* costars Sean Astin, Sean Bean, Orlando Bloom, Billy Boyd, Ian McKellen, Dominic Monaghan, Viggo Mortensen, Miranda Otto, John Rhys-Davies, Andy Serkis, Karl Urban, and Elijah Wood, plus writer Philippa Boyens and director Peter Jackson – joined Josh Gad's YouTube series *Reunited Apart* which reunites the cast of popular movies through video-conferencing, and promotes donations to non-profit charities.[86][87]\n\n\nIt was announced in March 2023 that she is to return as Betty Ross in *Captain America: Brave New World*, 15 years after her first appearance in *The Incredible Hulk*.[88]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tyler in September 2016\nTyler dated her *Inventing the Abbotts* co-star Joaquin Phoenix from 1995 to 1998. During her relationship with Phoenix, she became a vegan; however, when the relationship ended, she went back to eating meat.[89] In 1998, she began dating British musician Royston Langdon of the band Spacehog.[2] They became engaged in February 2001,[90] and married in Barbados on March 25, 2003.[91] In December 2004, she gave birth to a son Milo William.[92][93] On May 8, 2008, they confirmed through representatives that they would be separating.[94]\n\n\nIn June 2010, Tyler stated she was \"far too sensitive\" for casual dates, adding \"I fall in love once in a blue moon.\"[95]\n\n\nIn 2014, Tyler met David Gardner, a British sports and entertainment manager. They became engaged in July 2015, but the couple ended their engagement in March 2021.[96] They have two children together: a son, Sailor Gene, born in February 2015,[97] and a daughter, Lula Rose, born in July 2016.[98] Tyler temporarily moved to London shortly after her daughter's birth.[84][99]\n\n\nTyler learned transcendental meditation in New York City.[100] In December 2012, she participated in a charity gala for the David Lynch Foundation to provide transcendental meditation to disadvantaged sections of society. At the event, she said, \"It helps me make better decisions and be a better mother, and just deal with the daily stress of the modern world that we live in. It helps with everything.\"[100]\n\n\nTyler bought a townhouse on West 11th Street in Greenwich Village, New York City for $2.53 million in 2001.[101] In 2019 she sold it for $17.45 million[102] in favour of London, where she has resided with her family since 2018.[103]\nShe also owns a house in Malibu, California.\n\n\nIn January 2021, Tyler said on Instagram that she had tested positive for COVID-19 on New Year's Eve, leaving her bedridden in isolation for 10 days.

He made his film debut in a small role in Peter Weir's 1985 thriller *Witness*. He appeared in several notable films, including *The Indian Runner* (1991), *Carlito's Way* (1993), *Crimson Tide* (1995), *Daylight* (1996), *The Portrait of a Lady* (1996), *G.I. Jane* (1997), *A Perfect Murder* (1998), *A Walk on the Moon* (1999), and *28 Days* (2000).\n\n\nMortensen gained international attention for playing Aragorn in the fantasy trilogy *The Lord of the Rings* (2001–2003). He gained acclaim for his collaborations with filmmaker David Cronenberg in the thrillers *A History of Violence* (2005), *Eastern Promises* (2007), for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor, and *A Dangerous Method* (2011).[4] He gained additional Academy Award nominations for his leading roles as an anarchist father in *Captain Fantastic* (2016) and as Tony Lip in *Green Book* (2018). Mortensen made his directorial debut with *Falling* (2020), in which he also starred.\n\n\nAside from acting, Mortensen has explored fine arts, photography, poetry, and music. In 2002, he founded the Perceval Press to publish both his works and the works of little-known artists and authors. Mortensen sang and composed for part of *The Lord of the Rings* soundtrack and has collaborated with guitarist Buckethead on several albums.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nMortensen was born in New York City on October 20, 1958,[3] the son of Grace Gamble (née Atkinson; July 8, 1928 – April 25, 2015) and Viggo Peter Mortensen Sr. (May 8, 1929 – March 2, 2017). His mother was American, while his father was Danish. They met in Norway.[5] His maternal grandfather was a Canadian from Nova Scotia. His paternal grandmother was from Trondheim, Norway.[6][7]\n\n\nThe family moved to Venezuela, then Denmark, and eventually settled in Argentina. They lived successively in the provinces of Córdoba, Chaco, and Buenos Aires. Mortensen attended primary school and acquired a fluent proficiency in Spanish while his father managed poultry farms and ranches.[8] He was baptized Lutheran, the tradition of his father.[9]\n\n\nWhen Mortensen was 11 and his brothers 8 and 6, their parents divorced. The three boys returned with their mother to the United States, where Viggo spent the rest of his childhood in New York State. He graduated from Watertown High School in 1976.[10][11] He attended St. Lawrence University in Canton, New York, earning a bachelor's degree in 1980 in Spanish studies and politics.[12]\n\n\nUpon graduating, Mortensen went to Europe, living for a time in the United Kingdom and Spain, before returning to Denmark. There he took various jobs such as driving trucks in Esbjerg and selling flowers in Copenhagen.[13][14] He eventually returned to the United States to pursue an acting career.[15]\n\n\n\n## Acting career[edit]\n\n\n### 1980s–1990s: First films[edit]\n\n\nMortensen's first film role was in *The Purple Rose of Cairo* (1985), but his scenes were deleted from the final cut.[16] His first onscreen appearance was playing an Amish farmer in Peter Weir's *Witness*. He was cast in *Witness* because the director thought he had the right face for the part of an Amish man. He had also been simultaneously cast for another role as a soldier in Shakespeare in the Park's production of *Henry V*, but he decided to choose acting in the film because he wanted to try something new. He credited that decision and the very positive experience on the film as the start of his film career.[17]\n\n\nAlso in 1985, he was cast in the role of Bragg on the TV series *Search for Tomorrow*. Mortensen's 1987 performance in *Bent* at the Coast Playhouse, Los Angeles, won him a Dramalogue Critics' Award. The play, about homosexual prisoners in a concentration camp, was known for the leading performance by Ian McKellen.[18] Mortensen later costarred with him in the film trilogy *The Lord of the Rings*. In 1987, Mortensen guest starred as a police detective on the hit TV series *Miami Vice.*[19]\n\n\nDuring the 1990s, Mortensen appeared in supporting roles in a variety of films, including Jane Campion's *The Portrait of a Lady*, *Young Guns II*, *Prison*, *Boiling Point*, *Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III*, Sean Penn's *The Indian Runner*, Danny Cannon's *The Young Americans*, Carl Colpaert's *The Crew*, which won the São Paulo Film Festival Audience Award, Brian de Palma's *Carlito's Way*, *Crimson Tide*, *G.I. Jane*, *Daylight*, *A Walk on the Moon*, *American Yakuza*, Charles Robert Carner's remake *Vanishing Point*, Philip Ridley's films *The Reflecting Skin* and *The Passion of Darkly Noon*, the remake films *A Perfect Murder* and Gus Van Sant's *Psycho* (the 1998 remakes of two Alfred Hitchcock's movies *Dial M for Murder* and *Psycho*), *28 Days*, and *The Prophecy*, with Christopher Walken. Of these roles, Mortensen was probably best known for playing Master Chief John Urgayle in *G.I. Jane*.[20]\n\n\n\n### 2000s: *The Lord of the Rings* and breakthrough[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mortensen at the premiere of *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King*, December 1, 2003\nAnother major mainstream breakthrough came in 1999, when Peter Jackson cast him as Aragorn in *The Lord of the Rings* film trilogy. According to the Special Extended Edition DVD of *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring*, Mortensen was a last-minute replacement for Stuart Townsend, and would not have taken the part of Aragorn had it not been for his son's enthusiasm for the J. R. R. Tolkien novel.[21] He received critical acclaim for his portrayal of Aragorn, and was ranked No. 15 on a 2015 survey of \"The 100 Greatest Movie Characters\" conducted by *Empire*.[22]\n\n\nIn *The Two Towers* DVD extras, the film's swordmaster, Bob Anderson, described Mortensen as \"the best swordsman I've ever trained.\" Mortensen often performed his own stunts, and even the injuries he sustained during several of them, including two broken toes, did not dampen his enthusiasm. At one point during shooting of *The Two Towers*, Mortensen, Orlando Bloom, and Brett Beattie (stunt double for John Rhys-Davies) all had painful injuries, and during a shoot of them, running in the mountains, Peter Jackson jokingly referred to the three as \"the walking wounded.\"[23] Also, according to the Special Extended Edition DVD of *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King*, Mortensen purchased the two horses, Uraeus and Kenny, whom he had ridden and bonded with over the duration of the films.[24]\n\n\nIn 2004, Mortensen starred as Frank Hopkins in *Hidalgo*, the story of an ex-army courier who travels to Arabia to compete with his horse, Hidalgo, in a dangerous desert race for a contest prize.[25]\n\n\n\nMortensen starred in David Cronenberg's 2005 film *A History of Violence* as a family man revealed to have had an unsavory previous career. He was nominated for a Satellite Award for Outstanding Actor in a Motion Picture for this role.[26] In the DVD extras for *A History of Violence*, Cronenberg related that Mortensen is the only actor he had come across who would come back from weekends with his family with items he had bought to use as props on the set.[27] \n\n![](image)Mortensen interviewed by eTalk Daily at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival, for *A History of Violence*\nIn 2006, he starred as Captain Diego Alatriste in the Spanish language film *Alatriste*, based on the series of novels *The Adventures of Captain Alatriste*, written by the Spanish writer Arturo Pérez-Reverte.[28]\n\n\nIn September 2007, the film *Eastern Promises*, directed by David Cronenberg, was released to critical acclaim for the film itself and for Mortensen's performance as a Russian gangster on the rise in London. His nude fight scene in a steam room was applauded by Roger Ebert: \"Years from now, it will be referred to as a benchmark.\"[29] Mortensen's performance in *Eastern Promises* resulted in his winning the Best Performance by an Actor in a British Independent Film award from the British Independent Film Awards.[30] He was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor.[31]\n\n\nMortensen appeared as himself in the 2009 film *Reclaiming The Blade*, in which he discussed his passion for the sword and his sword-work in films such as *The Lord of the Rings* and *Alatriste*. Mortensen also talked about his work with Bob Anderson, the swordmaster on *The Lord of the Rings*, *Alatriste*, *Pirates of the Caribbean* and many others.[32]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mortensen at the 32nd Genie Awards in March 2012\nIn 2009, Mortensen performed in *The People Speak*, a documentary feature film that uses dramatic and musical performances of the letters, diaries, and speeches of everyday Americans, based on historian Howard Zinn's *A People's History of the United States*. While it was reported in April 2009 that Mortensen had, at least temporarily, retired from film acting,[33] Mortensen said he was misquoted. In a 2012 interview, he denied that he ever said he was retiring, only that he didn't have \"plans to do another movie\" at the time and that he was \"taking a little break now. I don't have anything lined up.\"[34] In 2009 he joined the cast of *The Road*, a film adaptation of the Cormac McCarthy novel of the same name,[35] and collaborated with David Cronenberg for a third time on *A Dangerous Method*.[36]\n\n\n\n### 2010s–present: Critical acclaim[edit]\n\n\nAfter two years, Mortensen returned to theater in 2011, starring in Ariel Dorfman's *Purgatorio* (\"Purgatory\") in Madrid.[37] *Purgatorio* is Mortensen's first play in Spanish. The play is about a man and woman confined either a psychiatric hospital or prison together. During production, Mortensen's mother became ill and he pulled out of the initial premiere date, the first time he had ever done so for a project. The play premiered from November 4 to December 18.[38]\n\n\nDuring production for the 2012 film *The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey*, Mortensen was offered to reprise his role as Aragorn, but he declined because the character does not appear in the novel the film is based on.[39]\n\n\nMortensen starred in the 2016 film *Captain Fantastic*, for which he received his second Academy Award nomination.[40] Alonso Duralde of *TheWrap* praised Mortensen's performance, saying, \"The movie really belongs to Mortensen, who allows Ben to be exasperating, arrogant, and impatient but also warm, loving, and caring. He's a tough but adoring father, a grieving widower and a passionate defender of his wife's final wishes, and Mortensen plays all these notes, and more with subtlety and grace\".[41]\n\n\nIn 2018, he starred in the film *Green Book*. Mortensen portrayed Tony Lip, an Italian-American bouncer hired to drive and protect pianist Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) on a tour through the Jim Crow South from 1962 to 1963. Reflecting on the character, Mortensen stated, \"I was attracted to playing Tony in part because it was a different kind of character, but the main thing I liked about him was his heart\".[42] Mortensen received his third Academy Award nomination for his portrayal of Lip.[43]\n\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Mortensen together with Sean Astin, Sean Bean, Orlando Bloom, Billy Boyd, Ian McKellen, Dominic Monaghan, Miranda Otto, John Rhys-Davies, Andy Serkis, Liv Tyler, Karl Urban, and Elijah Wood, plus writer Philippa Boyens and director Peter Jackson from *The Lord of the Rings* in May 2020 joined actor Josh Gad's YouTube series *Reunited Apart*, which reunites the cast of popular movies through video-conferencing, and promotes donations to non-profit charities.[44]\n\n\nIn 2020 he released his directorial debut *Falling* which he also wrote, produced, composed the score for and starred in alongside Lance Henriksen.[45] Mortensen had based the story on his own family's history, including his parents suffering from dementia. The film is dedicated to his brothers, Charles and Walter Mortensen.[46]\n\n\nMortensen was cast as British cave diver Rick Stanton in the biographical film *Thirteen Lives* directed by Ron Howard which was released in July 2022.[47] Mortensen was taught cave diving by Stanton personally to prepare for the role.[48]\n\n\nHe reunited with David Cronenberg in the horror sci-fi film *Crimes of the Future* alongside Kristen Stewart with filming beginning in August 2021.[49] Mortensen will also reunite with Lisandro Alonso on the film *Eureka*.[50] Mortensen and Caleb Landry Jones will star together in the Vietnam War thriller *Two Wolves* which will be directed by documentary filmmaker Alex Gibney.[51]\n\n\nHe wrote, directed, and stars in a Western film titled *The Dead Don't Hurt*. It also stars Vicky Krieps and it was shot in Mexico.[52][53]\n\n\n\n## Literary and arts career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mortensen in 2010\n### Perceval Press[edit]\n\n\nWith part of his earnings from *The Lord of the Rings*, Mortensen founded the Perceval Press publishing house—named after the knight from the legend of King Arthur—to help other artists by publishing works that might not find a home in more traditional publishing venues.[54] *Perceval Press* is also the home of Mortensen's many personal artistic projects in the area of fine arts, photography, poetry, song, and literature.[55]\n\n\n\n### Bibliography[edit]\n\n\nMortensen is also an author, with various books of poetry, photography, and painting published. His poems are written in English, Danish, and Spanish. With anthropologists Federico Bossert and Diego Villar, he has written several works related to ethnography of natives in South America,[56] specifically in Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay.

His paintings are frequently abstract and often contain fragments of his poetry therein.[63] His paintings have been featured in galleries worldwide, and many of the paintings of the artist he portrayed in *A Perfect Murder* are his own.[64]\n\n\nMortensen experiments with his poetry and music by mixing the two art forms. He has collaborated with guitarist Buckethead on several albums, mostly released on his own label (Perceval Press) or TDRS Music. Viggo was first introduced to Buckethead's work while working on sounds for an educational CD on Greek mythology. The finished product included a guitar part by Buckethead, which caught Viggo's ear and led him to initiate contact with the guitarist. The collaboration grew from there.[65]\n\n\nMortensen's discography includes:[66]\n\n\n\n* 1994: *Don't Tell Me What to Do*\n* 1997: *One Less Thing to Worry About*\n* 1998: *Recent Forgeries*\n* 1999: *The Other Parade*\n* 1999: *One Man's Meat*\n* 1999: *Live at Beyond Baroque*\n* 2003: *Pandemoniumfromamerica*\n* 2004: *Live at Beyond Baroque II*\n* 2004: *Please Tomorrow*\n* 2004: *This, That, and the Other*\n* 2005: *Intelligence Failure*\n* 2006: *3 Fools 4 April*\n* 2007: *Time Waits for Everyone*\n* 2008: *At All*\n* 2010: *Canciones de Invierno*\n* 2011: *Reunion*\n* 2013: *Acá*\n* 2015: *Under the Weather*\n* 2016: *Seventeen Odd Songs*\n* 2017: *Preguntas Desde la Orilla*\n* 2018: *Godzilla Sleeps Alone*\n\nMortensen is featured on *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* soundtrack, singing \"Aragorn's Coronation\" (the name of the extended version of this song in the 3rd original sound track is \"The Return of the King\"), the words by Tolkien and the music composed by Mortensen.[67] In the extended DVD edition of the first *Lord of the Rings* movie, *The Fellowship of the Ring*, he sings the song \"The Lay of Beren and Lúthien\".[68]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### Family and relationships[edit]\n\n\nMortensen holds dual American and Danish citizenship.[1] He has stated that he was raised speaking English and Spanish, and sometimes feels that, when speaking Spanish, he \"can get to the heart of the matter better\".[69]\n\n\nMortensen met singer Exene Cervenka in 1986 on the set of the comedy *Salvation!* The couple married on July 8, 1987. On January 28, 1988, Cervenka gave birth to their son, who later played his on-screen son in the film *Crimson Tide* in 1995. His son graduated from Columbia University in 2010 with a B.A. in archaeology and has been working at Perceval Press, which was founded by his father.[70][71][72] Mortensen and Cervenka lived in Idaho for three years.[73] They separated in 1992 and divorced in 1997.[74] Since 2009, he has been in a relationship with Spanish actress Ariadna Gil. Though the couple reside in Madrid, Mortensen spends much of his time in the United States, and has stated, \"I am a citizen and longtime resident of the United States and am attached to its landscapes, history, and people.\"[75][76] He has owned property in Sandpoint, Idaho, and spends time there when not filming movies.[77]\n\n\nMortensen has talked about his family's struggles with dementia, seeing both of his parents, three of his four grandparents, aunts, uncles, and his stepfather battle the condition.[78] In 2016, Mortensen traveled to New York to take care of his father,[75] who died a year later.[78] Two years earlier, Mortensen's mother had also died from complications of the condition.[78]\n\n\nMortensen was a close friend of Icelandic painter Georg Guðni Hauksson until the latter's death in 2011. He had long been an admirer of Georg Guðni's work as a landscape artist, and the two published books together as well as maintaining a close friendship.[79]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nMortensen has expressed a liking for association football, ice hockey and baseball. His favorite teams include Argentine club San Lorenzo de Almagro,[80] English team Fulham,[81] Spanish team Real Madrid,[82] Turkish team Beşiktaş,[83] and both the Argentine and Danish national teams.[84] His favorite soccer players are Diego Maradona and Héctor \"Bambino\" Veira.[85] He is a fan of the Montreal Canadiens and wore a Canadiens shirt underneath his costume throughout the filming of the *Lord of the Rings* trilogy.[86] During the 100th anniversary celebrations of the Montreal Canadiens, Mortensen introduced one of his idols, Guy Lafleur, to the crowd at the Bell Centre in Montreal.[87] He is also a fan of the New York Mets and, in an interview promoting 2009 film *The Road*, was seen wearing apparel indicating his support for the Australian Football League's Collingwood Magpies.[88] While appearing on the *Late Show with David Letterman*, he held a sign supporting the New York Giants of the NFL.[89]\n\n\n\n### Political activities[edit]\n\n\nMortensen was one of the signers of the \"Toronto Declaration\" protesting against spotlighting Tel Aviv at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2009.[90][91]\n\n\nIn 2015 Mortensen donated $1,000 to Irish political party Sinn Fein.[92]\n\n\nMortensen endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders for U.S. president during the primaries for the 2016 election.[93] After Sanders failed to win the Democratic Party nomination, Mortensen endorsed Green Party candidate Jill Stein.[94] He wrote an open letter just before Election Day 2016 in which he listed the reasons he disagreed with Hillary Clinton’s policies and could not support her in the race against Donald Trump, though he thought that Clinton would be elected president.[95] He went on to narrate a documentary, *The Revolution Televised*, about the 2016 presidential election and the protests in the aftermath of the Democratic National Convention.[96]\n\n\nSince 2018 Mortensen has been a member of the Catalan NGO Òmnium Cultural, a pro-independence organization dedicated to promoting Catalan culture and language in the arts and the public sphere.[97] His longtime partner and her extended family were supporters of the 2017 Catalan independence referendum. In 2019, he publicly criticized the use of his character Aragorn by the far-right Spanish party Vox during the campaign for the 2019 Spanish general election.[98]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section of a biography of a living person **needs additional citations for verification**.

His acting roles include Mikey Walsh in *The Goonies* (1985), Billy Tepper in *Toy Soldiers* (1991), Daniel Ruettiger in *Rudy* (1993), Samwise Gamgee in *The Lord of the Rings* trilogy (2001–2003), Doug Whitmore in *50 First Dates* (2004), Bill in *Click* (2006), Lynn McGill in the fifth season of *24* (2006), Oso in *Special Agent Oso* (2009–2012), Raphael in *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles* (2012–2017), Bob Newby in the second season of Netflix's *Stranger Things* (2017),[1] and Ed in *No Good Nick* (2019).\n\n\nAstin is the son of actress Patty Duke and adopted by actor John Astin. He has received various recognitions including a Screen Actors Guild Award and two Young Artist Awards. Astin was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film in 1994 for the short film *Kangaroo Court*.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nAstin was born in Santa Monica, California, on February 25, 1971, as the son of actress Patty Duke (1946–2016) and Michael Tell (born 1950).[2][3][4] However, at the time, it was reported that entertainer Desi Arnaz Jr. was his biological father. During that time, Duke also had a personal relationship with Michael Tell, a writer, music promoter, and publisher of the newspaper *The Las Vegas Israelite*. When Duke became pregnant, she was unsure whether Arnaz or Tell was the father, so Tell offered to marry her as a way out of the scandal. The marriage lasted only 13 days in 1970, and ended before Astin was born.[5][6][7]\n\n\nOn August 5, 1972, Duke married actor John Astin, having been in a relationship with him for two years. When the wedding guests were invited to speak, 18-month-old Astin looked at John and cried, \"Daddy!\", to which the Episcopal priest performing the ceremony remarked, \"Well, that about does it!\"[8] John subsequently adopted Astin. In 1973, Duke gave birth to Astin's brother Mackenzie Astin, who also became an actor. Duke and John Astin divorced in 1985.[9] Duke married Mike Pearce in 1986,[5] and they adopted a son, Kevin, in 1989.[9]\n\n\nWhen Astin was 14, Duke told him that Arnaz was his father, and the two developed a relationship. However, in his mid-20s, Astin met a relative of Michael Tell who suggested they were related. Sean set out to find the truth about his biological father, and underwent genetic tests which showed Tell was his biological father.[10] Astin has maintained close relationships with all three, and saying: \"Desi Arnaz Jr. loves me, and I love him. We are so close ... Science tells me ... that he's not my biological father. Science tells me that Mike Tell is.\" Astin considers John his father, as John was the one who raised him. Astin is also close to his stepfather, Mike Pearce, saying, \"I can call any of them on the phone any time I want to. John, Desi, Mike, or Papa Mike ... my four dads.\"[5]\n\n\nAstin is of German and Irish ancestry through his mother and Austrian Jewish and Polish Jewish through his biological father.[11][12][13] Astin attended Catholic school and later became a Protestant.[14]\n\n\nAstin attended the Crossroads High School for the Arts and undertook master classes at the Stella Adler Conservatory in Los Angeles. He graduated cum laude from UCLA with a B.A. in History and English (American literature and culture). An alumnus of Los Angeles Valley College, Astin served on the school's board of directors of the Patrons Association and the Arts Council.[15]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### Early career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Astin in 1997\nAstin's first acting role was in a 1981 television film titled *Please Don't Hit Me, Mom*,[16] in which he played an 8-year-old child with an abusive mother (portrayed by his real-life mother Patty Duke). Astin made his film debut at the age of 13 as Mikey in *The Goonies* (1985).\n\n\nAfter *The Goonies*, Astin appeared in several more films, including the Disney television film *The B.R.A.T. Patrol*, opposite Nia Long, Tim Thomerson, and Brian Keith; *Like Father Like Son* (1987); *White Water Summer* with Kevin Bacon (1987), *The War of the Roses* (1989); the World War II film *Memphis Belle* (1990); *Toy Soldiers* (1991); *Encino Man* (1992); and the college football biopic *Rudy* (1993), about the life-changing struggles and rewards of the titular character, Daniel Ruettiger.\n\n\nIn 1994, Astin directed and co-produced (with his wife, Christine Astin) the short film *Kangaroo Court*, which received an Academy Award nomination for Best Live Action Short Film. Astin continued to appear in films throughout the 1990s, including the Showtime science fiction film *Harrison Bergeron* (1995), the Gulf War film *Courage Under Fire* (1996), and the Warren Beatty political satire *Bulworth* (1998).\n\n\n\n### *The Lord of the Rings*[edit]\n\n\nIn the early 2000s, Astin played Samwise Gamgee in Peter Jackson's *The Lord of the Rings* film trilogy, consisting of *The Fellowship of the Ring* (2001), *The Two Towers* (2002), and *The Return of the King* (2003). Many awards were bestowed upon the trilogy, particularly its final installment, which earned eleven Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Astin received seven award nominations for his own performance, and won five, including the Saturn Award, the Sierra Award, the Seattle Film Critics Award, and the Utah Film Critics Award (all for Best Supporting Actor), and the Visual Effects Society Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male or Female in an Effects Film.[17][*better source needed*] *The Return of the King* cast as an ensemble received awards from the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures, the Screen Actors Guild, the Broadcast Film Critics Association, and received a Gold Derby Award.[18][*better source needed*]\n\n\nThroughout the filming process, Astin became close friends with several cast members, and became particularly good friends with costar Elijah Wood. Astin's daughter, Alexandra, is in the closing scene of *The Return of the King*. She plays his onscreen daughter, Elanor Gamgee, who runs out to him as he returns from the Grey Havens.\n\n\nWhile working on *The Lord of the Rings*, Astin persuaded a number of fellow cast and crew members, including director Peter Jackson, to assist him in making his second short film, *The Long and Short of It*. The film, which takes place on a street in Wellington, New Zealand, premiered at the 2003 Sundance Film Festival and can be found on the DVD for *The Two Towers*, along with a \"making of\" video.\n\n\nIn 2004, Astin released *There and Back Again* (ISBN 0-312-33146-0), a memoir (co-written with Joe Layden) of his film career with emphasis on his experiences during production of *The Lord of the Rings* trilogy. The title is derived from the title of J. R. R. Tolkien's novel *The Hobbit*, as well as the fictional book written by Bilbo Baggins in *The Lord of the Rings*.\n\n\n\n### After *The Lord of the Rings*[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Astin at UIUC, 2009\nSince *The Lord of the Rings*, Astin has continued to work in film and television.

He narrated the American version of the Animal Planet series *Meerkat Manor*, and voices the title character in *Special Agent Oso* which aired on Playhouse Disney from 2009 to 2011 and Disney Junior from 2011 to early 2014.[21] Astin's other voice work includes *Balto III: Wings of Change*, in which he voiced Kodi, a teenage husky who is the son of the titular character, and the video game *Kingdom Hearts*, in the latter of which he provided the voice of Hercules, replacing actor Tate Donovan, who was unavailable but would return for *Kingdom Hearts II*. Astin also voiced Raphael in the *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles* animated series on Nickelodeon, which premiered on September 29, 2012, running for five seasons and 124 episodes, and ending on November 12, 2017.\n\n\nIn 2010, Astin joined the Stella Adler Los Angeles Theatre Collective acting company.[22] Also as of 2010, Astin and his wife, Christine, were making a film based on Lois Lowry's Newbery Medal-winning novel *Number the Stars*.[23][24] They bought the film rights in 2008 and wrote a screenplay adaptation, with plans to direct and produce it themselves.[25]\n\n\nIn March 2012, Astin played a cosmetic surgeon named Takin Mastuhmik in a fake trailer entitled *Boobathon* which appeared on Funny or Die.[26] In March 2014, Astin played a soldier in *Boys of Abu Ghraib*, a military thriller inspired by the events that made worldwide news in 2004.[27][*better source needed*] In June of that year, he began playing the role of Jim Kent on the FX drama *The Strain*.[28]\n\n\nIn October 2015, Astin played Hank Erwin in *Woodlawn*, a story about how a high school football team overcame racism and hate, and found unity and success through following Jesus.[29]\n\n\nIn 2017, Astin played the role of Bob Newby in season two of the Netflix series *Stranger Things*. In 2019, Astin reprised the role of Newby in flashback scenes during the series' third season, played the role of Dr. Greg Pemberton on several episodes of *The Big Bang Theory*, and had a guest appearance on the fifth season of *Supergirl*. In 2019, he was in the Netflix dramedy *No Good Nick* in which he played Ed. That same year, he appeared in the sixth season of *Brooklyn Nine-Nine*.\n\n\nIn May 2020, Astin joined Josh Gad's YouTube series *Reunited Apart*, which reunites the casts of popular films through video-conferencing and promotes donations to non-profit charities.

They have three daughters: Alexandra (born in November 1996), Elizabeth (born in August 2002), and Isabella (born in July 2005), all having the middle name Louise.[33] His wife held the Miss Indiana Teen USA title in 1984.[34] Alexandra had a small cameo role in *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* as Elanor Gamgee, Astin's character's daughter, and appears in *Bad Kids of Crestview Academy* as Ethel Balducci.\n\n\nAstin has a tattoo on his ankle of the word \"nine\" written with the Tengwar script, commemorating his *Lord of the Rings* involvement and his character's membership in the \"Fellowship of the Ring\". Seven of the eight other actors (Elijah Wood, Sean Bean, Billy Boyd, Ian McKellen, Dominic Monaghan, Viggo Mortensen and Orlando Bloom) all have the same tattoo. John Rhys-Davies' stunt double, Brett Beattie, has the tattoo as well.[35]\n\n\nIn an August 2013 interview, Astin said that he is a Lutheran Christian, having been \"baptized in my wife's Lutheran church\".[14]\n\n\nIn January 2015, Astin completed the Dopey Challenge at the Walt Disney World Resort which involves running a 5k, 10k, half-marathon and full marathon on four consecutive days.[36][37]\n\n\nOn October 10, 2015, Astin competed in the 2015 Ironman World Championship in Kailua Kona, Hawaii.

In 2018, she was ranked among the world's highest-paid actresses.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The National Institute of Dramatic Art in Kensington, New South Wales, where Blanchett studied\nCatherine Elise Blanchett was born on 14 May 1969 in the Ivanhoe suburb of Melbourne.[5][6] Her Australian mother, June (née Gamble),[7] was a property developer and teacher; and her American father, Robert DeWitt Blanchett Jr., a Texas native, was a United States Navy Chief Petty Officer who became an advertising executive.[8][9][10] They met when Robert's ship broke down in Melbourne.[11] When Blanchett was ten, her father died of a heart attack, leaving her mother to raise the family.[12][13] Blanchett is the second of three children, with an older brother and younger sister.[12] Her ancestry includes English, some Scottish, and remote French roots.[13][14][15]\n\n\nBlanchett has described herself as a \"part extrovert, part wallflower\" child.[12] During her teenage years she had a penchant for dressing in traditionally masculine clothing, and went through goth and punk phases, at one point shaving her head.[12] She attended primary school in Melbourne at Ivanhoe East Primary School; for her secondary education, she attended Ivanhoe Girls' Grammar School and then Methodist Ladies' College, where she explored her passion for the performing arts.[16] In her late teens and early twenties, she worked at a nursing home in Victoria.[17] After high school, she began a degree in economics and fine arts at the University of Melbourne but dropped out after one year to travel overseas. While in Egypt, Blanchett was asked to be an extra as an American cheerleader in the Egyptian boxing film *Kaboria* (1990); in need of money, she accepted the job.[12][18][19] On returning to Australia, she moved to Sydney and enrolled at the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA),[18] graduating in 1992 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts.[12]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 1992–2000: Early work and international breakthrough[edit]\n\n\nBlanchett's first stage role was opposite Geoffrey Rush, in the 1992 David Mamet play *Oleanna* for the Sydney Theatre Company. That year, she was also cast as Clytemnestra in a production of *Sophocles' Electra*. A couple of weeks after rehearsals, the actress playing the title role pulled out, and director Lindy Davies cast Blanchett in the role. Her performance as Electra became one of her most acclaimed at NIDA.[11] In 1993, Blanchett was awarded the Sydney Theatre Critics' Best Newcomer Award for her performance in Timothy Daly's *Kafka Dances* and won Best Actress for her performance in Mamet's *Oleanna*, making her the first actor to win both categories in the same year.[11] Blanchett played the role of Ophelia in an acclaimed 1994–1995 Company B production of *Hamlet* directed by Neil Armfield, starring Rush and Richard Roxburgh, and was nominated for a Green Room Award.[20] She appeared in the 1994 TV miniseries *Heartland* opposite Ernie Dingo, the miniseries *Bordertown* (1995) with Hugo Weaving, and in an episode of *Police Rescue* entitled \"The Loaded Boy\".[21][22] She also appeared in the 50-minute drama short *Parklands* (1996), which received an Australian Film Institute (AFI) nomination for Best Original Screenplay.[23][24]\n\n\nBlanchett made her feature film debut with a supporting role as an Australian nurse captured by the Japanese Army during World War II, in Bruce Beresford's film *Paradise Road* (1997), which co-starred Glenn Close and Frances McDormand.[13] The film made just over $2 million at the box office on a budget of $19 million and received mixed reviews from critics.[25][26] Her first leading role came later that year as eccentric heiress Lucinda Leplastrier in Gillian Armstrong's romantic drama *Oscar and Lucinda* (1997), opposite Ralph Fiennes.[13] Blanchett received wide acclaim for her performance,[18] with Emanuel Levy of *Variety* declaring, \"luminous newcomer Blanchett, in a role originally intended for Judy Davis, is bound to become a major star\".[27] She earned her first AFI Award nomination as Best Leading Actress for *Oscar and Lucinda*.[28] She won the AFI Best Actress Award in the same year for her starring role as Lizzie in the romantic comedy *Thank God He Met Lizzie* (1997), co-starring Richard Roxburgh and Frances O'Connor.[18]\n\n\n\n![](image)Shekhar Kapur directed Blanchett in *Elizabeth* (1998), for which she received her first Academy Award nomination.\nBlanchett's played a young Elizabeth I in the critically acclaimed historical drama *Elizabeth* (1998), directed by Shekhar Kapur. The film catapulted her to international prominence, earning her the Golden Globe Award and British Academy Award (BAFTA), and her first Screen Actors Guild (SAG) and Academy Award nomination for Best Actress.[11][20] In his review for *Variety*, critic David Rooney wrote of her performance, \"Blanchett conveys with grace, poise and intelligence that Elizabeth was a wily, decisive, advanced thinker, far too aware of her own exceptional nature to bow to any man. [She] builds the juicy character almost imperceptibly from a smart but wary young woman who may be in over her head into a powerful creature of her own invention.\"[29] Janet Maslin of *The New York Times* wrote that Blanchett's performance \"brings spirit, beauty and substance to what otherwise might have been turned into a vacuous role\",[30] and Alicia Potter writing for the *Boston Phoenix* stated that, \"In the end, Kapur's crown jewel is a tale of twin transformations, that of Elizabeth into one of history's most enigmatic and powerful women, and that of Blanchett into, well, a bona fide screen queen.\"[31]\n\n\nThe following year, Blanchett appeared in *Bangers* (1999), an Australian short film and part of *Stories of Lost Souls*, a compilation of thematically related short stories. The short was written and directed by her husband, Andrew Upton, and produced by Blanchett and Upton.[32][33] She also appeared in the Mike Newell comedy *Pushing Tin* (1999), with her performance singled out by critics,[18] and the critically acclaimed and financially successful film *The Talented Mr. Ripley* (1999), alongside Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jude Law, and Philip Seymour Hoffman. She received her second BAFTA nomination for her performance as Meredith Logue in *The Talented Mr. Ripley*.[13]\n\n\n\n### 2001–2007: *The Lord of the Rings* and established actor[edit]\n\n\nBlanchett appeared in Peter Jackson's blockbuster trilogy, *The Lord of the Rings*, playing the role of elf leader Galadriel in all three films.[13] The trilogy was a major critical and financial success, earning $2.981 billion at the box office worldwide,[34][35][36] and all three films were later ranked within the top 10 greatest fantasy movies of all time in a poll conducted by American magazine *Wired* in 2012.[37] In addition to *The Lord of the Rings*, 2001 also saw Blanchett diversify her portfolio with a range of roles in the dramas *Charlotte Gray* and *The Shipping News* and the American crime-comedy *Bandits*, for which she earned a second Golden Globe and SAG Award nomination.[38] *Bandits* marked Blanchett's first notable foray into the comedy genre, with Ben Falk of the BBC declaring her and co-star Billy Bob Thornton \"a real find as comedians\" and calling her performance as an unsatisfied housewife caught between two escaped convicts, \"unhinged, though undeniably sexy\".[39]\n\n\nIn 2002, Blanchett starred opposite Giovanni Ribisi in Tom Tykwer-directed *Heaven*, the first film in an unfinished trilogy by acclaimed writer-director Krzysztof Kieślowski.[20][40] Her performance in the film as a grieving woman who commits a desperate act of terrorism was highly praised, with Stephen Holden of *The New York Times* calling it, \"the most compelling screen performance of her career\" and going on to state, \"Although Ms. Blanchett's face has always registered emotion with a mercurial fluidity, the immediacy of feeling she conveys in \"Heaven\" is astonishing.\"[41] 2003 saw Blanchett again playing a wide range of roles: Galadriel in the third and final instalment of the *Lord of the Rings* trilogy (which won the Academy Award for Best Picture);[42] the Ron Howard-directed western thriller *The Missing*; Jim Jarmusch's *Coffee and Cigarettes*, playing two roles (both against herself), for which she received an Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Female nomination;[43] and the biographical *Veronica Guerin*, which earned her a Golden Globe Best Actress Drama nomination.[20] In 2004, Blanchett portrayed a pregnant journalist chronicling an underwater voyage by an eccentric oceanographer in Wes Anderson's *The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou*.\n\n\nBlanchett won her first Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress in 2005, for her highly acclaimed portrayal of Katharine Hepburn in Martin Scorsese's *The Aviator* (2004).[44] This made Blanchett the first actor in history to win an Academy Award for portraying another Academy Award-winning actor.[45] She lent her Oscar statuette to the Australian Centre for the Moving Image.[46] In his review for *Newsweek*, David Ansen wrote that Blanchett portrayed Hepburn with \"lip-smacking vivacity\",[47] and Roger Ebert lauded the performance, describing it as \"delightful and yet touching; mannered and tomboyish\".[48] During her preparation for the role, and at the request of Scorsese, Blanchett reviewed 35-millimeter prints of all of Hepburn's first 15 screen performances to study and memorise her poise, mannerisms and speech pattern.[49] Blanchett spoke of the responsibility of portraying such an iconic star, stating, \"Representing Kate in the same medium, film, in which she existed was very daunting. But because she was so private and few people really knew her, we basically know Hepburn through her films. So of course you have to give a nod to her screen persona when playing her.\"[49] That year, Blanchett also won the Australian Film Institute Best Actress Award for her performance as Tracy Heart, a former heroin addict, in the Australian film *Little Fish* (2005), co-produced by her and her husband's production company, Dirty Films.[32] Though lesser known globally than some of her other films, the sober and sensitive[50] *Little Fish* received great critical acclaim in Blanchett's native Australia and was nominated for 13 Australian Film Institute awards.[51][52]\n\n\n\n![](image)Blanchett attending an event for *The Good German* at the 2007 Berlin International Film Festival\nIn 2006, Blanchett portrayed Hedda Gabler at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in the Sydney Theatre Company production of *Hedda Gabler*, directed by Robyn Nevin.[53] She then starred opposite Brad Pitt in Alejandro González Iñárritu's multi-lingual, multi-narrative drama *Babel*, as one half of a grieving couple who get caught up in an international incident in Morocco. *Babel* received seven Academy Award nominations.[54] She also co-starred in the Steven Soderbergh-directed World War II-set drama *The Good German* with George Clooney, and the acclaimed psychological thriller *Notes on a Scandal* opposite Dame Judi Dench.[18][20] Blanchett received a third Academy Award nomination for her performance in the latter film,[55] where she portrays a lonely teacher who embarks on an affair with a 15-year-old student and becomes the object of obsession for an older woman played by Dench. Both Blanchett's and Dench's performances were highly acclaimed, with Peter Bradshaw writing in *The Guardian*, \"Director Richard Eyre, with unshowy authority, gets the best out of Dench and Blanchett and, with great shrewdness, elicits from these two actors all the little tensions and exasperations - as well as the genuine tenderness - in their tragically fraught relationship.\"[56]\n\n\nIn 2007, Blanchett was named one of *Time* magazine's 100 Most Influential People in the World,[57] and appeared on *Forbes*' Celebrity 100 list.[58] She made a cameo as Janine, forensic scientist and ex-girlfriend of Simon Pegg's character, in Edgar Wright's action comedy film *Hot Fuzz* (2007). The cameo was uncredited and she gave her fee to charity.[59] She reprised her role as Queen Elizabeth I in the 2007 sequel *Elizabeth: The Golden Age* directed by Shekhar Kapur, and portrayed Jude Quinn, one of six incarnations of Bob Dylan in Todd Haynes' experimental film *I'm Not There*. She won the Volpi Cup Best Actress Award at the Venice Film Festival, the Independent Spirit Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal of Jude Quinn.[60][61][62] At the 80th Academy Awards, Blanchett received two nominations – Best Actress for *Elizabeth: the Golden Age* and Best Supporting Actress for *I'm Not There* – becoming the first actress to receive a second nomination with the reprisal of a role.[63] Of her achievement that year, Roger Ebert said, \"That Blanchett could appear in the same Toronto International Film Festival playing Elizabeth and Bob Dylan, both splendidly, is a wonder of acting.\"[64]\n\n\n\n### 2008–2011: Directing the Sydney Theatre Company[edit]\n\n\nBlanchett next appeared in Steven Spielberg's *Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull* (2008), as the villainous KGB agent Col. Dr. Irina Spalko.[65] The film received mixed reviews from critics and audiences but was a major box office success, grossing over $790 million worldwide.[66] In David Fincher's Oscar-nominated *The Curious Case of Benjamin Button*, she co-starred with Brad Pitt for a second time, playing the title character's love interest, Daisy Fuller. In the same year, Blanchett voiced the character of Granmamare for the English language version of Hayao Miyazaki's *Ponyo*, released in July 2008.[67]\n\n\n\n![](image)Blanchett at the 2011 Sydney Film Festival\nAlso in 2008, Blanchett and her husband Andrew Upton became co-CEOs and artistic directors of the Sydney Theatre Company.[68][69] Blanchett returned to acting in the theatre in 2009 with the Sydney Theatre Company production of Tennessee Williams' *A Streetcar Named Desire*, directed by Liv Ullmann. She starred as Blanche DuBois alongside Joel Edgerton as Stanley Kowalski. Ullmann and Blanchett had been meaning to collaborate on a project since Ullman's intended film adaption of *A Doll's House* fell by the wayside. Blanchett proposed embarking on *Streetcar* to Ullmann, who jumped at the opportunity after initial discussion.[70][71]\n\n\n*A Streetcar Named Desire* production travelled from Sydney to the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York, and the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.[72][73] It was a critical and commercial success and Blanchett received acclaim for her performance as Blanche DuBois.[77] *The New York Times* critic Ben Brantley said, \"Ms. Ullmann and Ms. Blanchett have performed the play as if it had never been staged before, with the result that, as a friend of mine put it, 'you feel like you're hearing words you thought you knew pronounced correctly for the first time.'\"[78] John Lahr of *The New Yorker* wrote of her portrayal, \"with her alert mind, her informed heart, and her lithe, patrician silhouette, [Blanchett] gets it right from the first beat ... I don't expect to see a better performance of this role in my lifetime.\"[79] Jane Fonda, who attended a New York show, deemed it \"perhaps the greatest stage performance I have ever seen\",[80] and Meryl Streep declared, \"That performance was as naked, as raw and extraordinary and astonishing and surprising and scary as anything I've ever seen ... I thought I'd seen that play, I thought I knew all the lines by heart, because I've seen it so many times, but I'd never seen the play until I saw that performance.\"[81] Blanchett won the Sydney Theatre Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role.[82] The production and Blanchett received Helen Hayes Awards, for Outstanding Non-Resident Production and Outstanding Lead Actress in a Non-Resident Production award, respectively.[83]\n\n\nIn 2010, Blanchett starred as Lady Marion opposite Russell Crowe's titular hero in Ridley Scott's epic *Robin Hood*. The film received mixed reviews from critics[84] but was a financial success, earning $321 million at the worldwide box office.[85] In 2011, she played the antagonist CIA agent Marissa Wiegler in Joe Wright's action thriller film *Hanna*, co-starring with Saoirse Ronan and Eric Bana.\n\n\nIn 2011, Blanchett took part in two Sydney Theatre Company productions. She played Lotte Kotte in a new translation of Botho Strauß's 1978 play *Groß und klein* (*Big and Small*) from Martin Crimp, directed by Benedict Andrews.[86] After its Sydney run, the production travelled to London, Paris, the Vienna Festival and Ruhrfestspiele.[10] Blanchett and the production received wide acclaim.[92] Blanchett was nominated for the *Evening Standard* Theatre Awards for Best Actress,[93] and won the Sydney Theatre Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role[94] and the Helpmann Award for Best Actress.[95] She then played Yelena, opposite Hugo Weaving and Richard Roxburgh, in Andrew Upton's adaptation of Anton Chekhov's *Uncle Vanya*, which travelled to the Kennedy Center and the New York City Center as part of the Lincoln Center Festival.[96] The production and Blanchett received critical acclaim,[99] with *The New York Times*' Ben Brantley declaring, \"I consider the three hours I spent on Saturday night watching [the characters] complain about how bored they are among the happiest of my theatregoing life ... This Uncle Vanya gets under your skin like no other I have seen ... [Blanchett] confirms her status as one of the best and bravest actresses on the planet.\"[100] *The Washington Post*'s Peter Marks dubbed the production Washington, D.C.'s top theatrical event of 2011.[7] Blanchett received the Helen Hayes Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Non-Resident Production, and the Helpmann Award for Best Actress.[95][101]\n\n\n\n### 2012–2016: *Blue Jasmine* and resurgence in Hollywood[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Blanchett promoting *The Hobbit: The Battle of Five Armies* at the 2014 San Diego Comic-Con International\nBlanchett reprised her role as Galadriel in Peter Jackson's adaptations of *The Hobbit* (2012–2014), prequel to *The Lord of the Rings* series, filmed in New Zealand.[102] While less critically acclaimed than *The Lord of the Rings* trilogy, *The Hobbit* trilogy was nonetheless a major box office success, earning nearly $3 billion worldwide.[103][104][105] The character of Galadriel does not appear in J.R.R. Tolkien's original novel, but the story was amended by co-writer Guillermo del Toro and director Peter Jackson so that Blanchett could appear in the film trilogy.[106] She voiced the role of \"Penelope\" in the *Family Guy* episode \"Mr. and Mrs. Stewie\", which aired on 29 April 2012, and Queen Elizabeth II in the episode \"Family Guy Viewer Mail 2\".[107][108] Blanchett returned to Australian film with her appearance in *The Turning* (2013), an anthology film based on a collection of short stories by Tim Winton.[109] She was head of jury of the 2012 and 2013 Dubai International Film Festival.[110] The Sydney Theatre Company's 2013 season was Blanchett's final one as co-CEO and artistic director.[68][111]\n\n\nIn 2013, Blanchett played Jasmine Francis, the lead role in Woody Allen's *Blue Jasmine*, co-starring Alec Baldwin and Sally Hawkins. Her performance garnered widespread acclaim, with some critics considering it to be the finest of her career to that point (surpassing her acclaimed performance in *Elizabeth*).[112] In his review for *The Guardian*, Mark Kermode proclaimed, \"Blanchett takes on the challenge like a peak-fitness runner facing a marathon, ploughing her way through 26 miles of emotional road pounding, with all the ups and downs, strains and tears, stomach turns and heartburns that that entails, a feat that occasionally leaves her (and us) gasping for breath.\"[113] Peter Travers, reviewing the film for *Rolling Stone*, called Blanchett's performance, \"miraculous\", and went on to write, \"The sight of Jasmine – lost, alone and unable to conjure magic out of unyielding reality – is devastating. This is Blanchett triumphant, and not to be missed.\"[114] The performance won her more than 40 industry and critics' awards, including the LAFCA Award, NYFCC Award, NSFC Award, Critics' Choice Award, Santa Barbara International Film Festival Outstanding Performance of the Year Award, SAG Award, Golden Globe Award, BAFTA Award, Independent Film Spirit Award and the Academy Award for Best Actress.[115] Blanchett's win made her just the sixth actress to win an Oscar in both of the acting categories, the third to win Best Actress after Best Supporting Actress, and the first Australian to win more than one acting Oscar.[116][117][118]\n\n\nAllen's adopted daughter Dylan Farrow has since criticised Blanchett and other actresses for working with Allen.[119][120] Blanchett responded, \"It's obviously been a long and painful situation for the family and I hope they find some resolution and peace.\"[121] On the subject of the Me Too movement, Blanchett said she thinks that \"social media is fantastic about raising awareness about issues, but it's not the judge and jury\" and the cases \"need to go into court, so if these abuses have happened, the person is prosecuted, so someone, who is not in the shiny industry that I am, can use that legal precedent to protect themselves. Always, in my industry or any other industry, they're preyed upon because they're vulnerable.\"[122][123]\n\n\nIn 2014, Blanchett co-starred with Matt Damon and George Clooney in the latter's ensemble film, *The Monuments Men*, based on the true story of a crew of art historians and museum curators who recover renowned works of art stolen by Nazis.[124] The French heroine Rose Valland was an inspiration for Blanchett's character of Claire Simone.[125] *The Monuments Men* received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $155 million at the worldwide box office.[126] That year, Blanchett also voiced the part of Valka in the DreamWorks Animation film *How to Train Your Dragon 2*.[127] The film received critical acclaim and was a box office success.[128] It went on to win the Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film and receive a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.[129][130] Blanchett guest starred on the Australian show *Rake*, as the onscreen female version of Richard Roxburgh's rogue protagonist, Cleaver.[131] On 29 January 2015, she co-hosted the 4th AACTA Awards with Deborah Mailman.[132]\n\n\n\n![](image)Blanchett attending the premiere of *Carol* at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival\nIn 2015, Blanchett starred in five films. She portrayed Nancy in Terrence Malick's *Knight Of Cups*, which premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival.[133] *IndieWire* named Blanchett's performance in *Knight of Cups* one of the 15 best performances in Terrence Malick films.[134] She starred as the villainous Lady Tremaine in Disney's Kenneth Branagh-directed live-action adaptation of *Cinderella*, to critical acclaim.[135][136] Writing for *Time* magazine, Richard Corliss declared that \"Blanchett [earns top billing], radiating a hauteur that chills as it amuses; the performance is grand without skirting parody.\"[137] She then starred opposite Rooney Mara in *Carol*, the highly acclaimed film adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's *The Price of Salt*, reuniting her with director Todd Haynes. Blanchett, who also served as an executive producer of the film, drew rave reviews for her performance as the titular character, which was widely cited as one of the best of her career, alongside *Elizabeth* and *Blue Jasmine*. Justin Chang of *Variety* proclaimed, \"As a study in the way beautiful surfaces can simultaneously conceal and expose deeper meanings, [Blanchett's] performance represents an all-too-fitting centerpiece for this magnificently realized movie.\"[138][139] For *Carol*, Blanchett received again Oscar, Golden Globe, and BAFTA Award nominations.[140][141][142]\n\n\nBlanchett portrayed Mary Mapes opposite Robert Redford's Dan Rather in *Truth* (2015), a film about the Killian documents controversy. Blanchett's production company was a producing partner for the film.[143] She then starred in *Manifesto*, Julian Rosefeldt's multi-screen video installation, in which 12 artist manifestos are depicted by 13 different characters all played by Blanchett.[144] The project, and Blanchett, received critical acclaim,[145] with Roberta Smith of *The New York Times* stating: \"If the art world gave out Oscars, Cate Blanchett should win for her tour de force of starring roles in 'Manifesto'\".[146] In 2016, Blanchett narrated one of two versions of Terence Malick's documentary on Earth and the universe, *Voyage of Time*, which had its world premiere at the 73rd Venice Film Festival.[147][148][149]\n\n\n\n### 2017–2020: Broadway debut and television success[edit]\n\n\nBlanchett starred in the Sydney Theatre Company play *The Present*, Andrew Upton's adaption of Anton Chekhov's play *Platonov*, directed by John Crowley.[150] The production debuted in Sydney in 2015, to critical acclaim, and transferred to Broadway in 2017,[151][152] marking Blanchett's Broadway debut.[153] Blanchett's performance during the play's Broadway run received acclaim. Ben Brantley of *The New York Times* remarked that \"Blanchett knows how to hold a stage and, if necessary, hijack it ... Such commanding, try-anything charisma is useful if you're attempting to hold together a badly assembled party or, for that matter, play.\"[154][155] For her work, Blanchett received a Tony Award nomination for Best Actress in a Play,[156] a Drama Desk Award nomination,[157] and a Drama League Award nomination for the Distinguished Performance Award.[158] In 2017, Blanchett also appeared in Terrence Malick's *Song to Song*, shot back-to-back with *Knight of Cups* in 2012,[159] and portrayed the goddess of death Hela in the Marvel Studios film *Thor: Ragnarok*, directed by Taika Waititi.[160] *Thor: Ragnarok* was both a critical and financial success, earning $854 million at the worldwide box office.[161]\n\n\nIn 2018, Blanchett starred in *Ocean's 8*, the all-female spin-off of the *Ocean's Eleven* franchise, directed by Gary Ross, opposite Sandra Bullock, Anne Hathaway, Sarah Paulson, Mindy Kaling, Helena Bonham Carter, Rihanna and Awkwafina.[162][163][164] The film garnered mainly mixed reviews but was a box office success, earning over $297 million worldwide.[165] She also portrayed Florence Zimmerman in the film adaptation of *The House with a Clock in Its Walls* directed by Eli Roth[166] and narrated Shannon Ashlyn's award-winning Australian historical fantasy film *Sweet Tooth*.[167] Blanchett was appointed the president of the jury of the 71st Cannes Film Festival, which took place in May 2018.[168] That year, *Forbes* listed her as one of world's highest-paid actresses with annual earnings of $12.5 million.[169]\n\n\n\n![](image)Blanchett at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival, where she served as jury president\nBlanchett portrayed a female version of the python Kaa in Andy Serkis' adaptation of *The Jungle Book* titled *Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle* (2018). Serkis utilised a mixture of motion capture, CG animation and live-action in the film, and the role of Kaa was written to be much closer to the original character in the short stories by the author Rudyard Kipling, which is as a mentor-like figure for Mowgli.[170] The film was released on Netflix in 2019.[171] In the same year, Blanchett starred in *Where'd You Go, Bernadette*, an adaptation of the best-selling book of the same name, which was directed by Richard Linklater.[172] The film received mostly mixed reviews and made $10.4 million at the box office against a budget of $18 million,[173][174] but Blanchett's performance as the titular character received praise, with Pete Hammond writing in his review for *Deadline*, \"[The film] doesn't quite measure up to expectations, despite a game performance from the incandescent Cate Blanchett, who clearly is the best reason to see this movie.\"[175] She received her tenth Golden Globe nomination for her performance in the film.[176] Also that year, she reprised her role as Valka in *How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World*, which was nominated for Best Animated Feature at the 92nd Academy Awards.[177][178]\n\n\nIn 2020, Blanchett's Dirty Films production company was signed with New Republic Pictures for feature films and FX Networks for television.[179][180] Blanchett returned to television by starring in two miniseries.

Every time Blanchett's Schlafly glides perfectly into the frame, there is simply nowhere else to look.\"[188] At the 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards, she received nominations for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie and Outstanding Limited Series, as well as nominations for the Golden Globe Award, the Screen Actors Guild Award (both for her performance), and the Television Critics Association Award for Individual Achievement in Drama.[189][190][191][192] Blanchett also served as an executive producer on the Greek film *Apples* (2020), directed by Christos Nikou.[193] The film premiered at the Venice International Film Festival to critical praise,[194][195] and was selected to be the country's submission to the Academy Awards as their Best Foreign Language Film.[196][197]\n\n\n\n### 2021–present: *Tár* and further acclaim[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Blanchett at the 2023 Berlin International Film Festival\nIn 2021, Blanchett starred alongside Bradley Cooper in Guillermo del Toro's film adaptation of the novel *Nightmare Alley*, which was released to positive reviews[198][199] and nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.[200] She also appeared alongside Jennifer Lawrence and Leonardo DiCaprio in Adam McKay's *Don't Look Up*, an apocalyptic political satire black comedy film for Netflix,[201] which also received an Oscar nomination for Best Picture.[200] With *Nightmare Alley* and *Don't Look Up*'s Best Picture Oscar nominations, Blanchett broke the record held by actress Olivia de Havilland of being the female actor with the most credited roles in Best Picture nominees.[202]\n\n\nBlanchett then starred in the 2022 film *Tár*, directed by Todd Field.

She has been forever daring, uncompromising and perpetually, resolutely, herself.\"[228] Blanchett's performance in the film *Carol* was ranked as the 2nd best movie performance of the decade by IndieWire in 2019. Writing of her performance in the film, Christian Zilko states, \"The greatest performance in a career where almost every role feels like a legitimate contender, Cate Blanchett's take on Carol Aird is a veritable symphony of repressive silence.\"[235]\n\n\nBlanchett has been cited in the press as being a style icon and has frequently topped lists of the best dressed women in the world.[236][237][238] In 2004, Blanchett was named the third most naturally beautiful woman of all time by a panel of beauty and fashion editors, make-up artists, model agencies and photographers, behind Audrey Hepburn and Liv Tyler.[239] She was in *Empire*'s list of the \"100 Sexiest Movie Stars of All-Time\" in 2007 and 2013.[240][241] In 2022, she was named in *The Hollywood Reporter*'s listing of \"Women in Entertainment Power 100\".[242]\n\n\nIn 2006, a portrait of Blanchett and her family painted by McLean Edwards was a finalist for the Art Gallery of New South Wales' Archibald Prize.[243] Another portrait of Blanchett was a finalist for the Archibald Prize in 2014.[244] Blanchett appeared in a series of commemorative postage stamps called Australian Legends in 2009, in recognition of the outstanding contribution made to Australian entertainment and culture.[245] In 2015, Madame Tussauds Hollywood unveiled a wax statue of Blanchett draped in a recreation of the yellow Valentino dress she wore to the 77th Academy Awards in 2005.[246] In 2019, Blanchett was among the \"10 inspirational women honored with a larger-than-life bronze sculpture\" as part of the Statues for Equality project, which \"aims to balance gender representation in public art and honor women's contributions to society\". The bronze statues were unveiled on Women's Equality Day: 26 August 2019 on Avenue of the Americas in New York City. Blanchett's statue is \"a creation based on a single image from the 2003 photoshoot by Matt Jones for  *Movieline's Hollywood Life* magazine.\"[247][248]\n\n\n\n## Activism[edit]\n\n\n### Environmental[edit]\n\n\nBlanchett has been a long term proponent of individual and collective action on climate change and other environmental issues. In 2006, she joined former US Vice-president Al Gore's Climate Project.[249][250] In 2007, Blanchett became the ambassador for the Australian Conservation Foundation.[251][252] She was made an honorary life member of the Australian Conservation Foundation in 2012, in recognition of her support for environmental issues.[249] At the beginning of 2011, Blanchett lent her support for a carbon tax.[253] She received some criticism for this, particularly from conservatives.[254][255] Blanchett is a patron of the international development charity SolarAid, which works to create a sustainable market for solar lights in Africa.[256]\n\n\nFrom 2008 to 2011, the Sydney Theatre Company under the leadership of Blanchett and her husband Andrew Upton, initiated a comprehensive large scale environmental program called *Greening the Wharf*, which invested in solar energy, rainwater harvesting, energy efficiency measures and best practice waste management.[257] The program won a Green Globe Award which was accepted by Blanchett and Upton.[258]\n\n\nIn January 2014, Blanchett took part in the Green Carpet Challenge, an initiative to raise the public profile of sustainable fashion, founded by Livia Firth of Eco-Age.[259][260] In September 2020, as part of her role as Jury President of the 77th Venice International Film Festival, Blanchett vowed that during the festival she would only wear outfits that she had previously worn at public events in an effort to highlight the issue of sustainability in the fashion industry.[261] In October of the same year, Blanchett was appointed by Prince William as a council member for the Earthshot Prize, which provides 50 environmental pioneers with the funds needed to further their work in tackling major problems impacting the environment.[262] In 2022, Blanchett launched the *Climate of Change* podcast on Audible together with Danny Kennedy to discuss climate change and the importance of preserving the environment.[263][264]\n\n\n\n### Humanitarian[edit]\n\n\n> \n> Like you, I have heard the gut-wrenching accounts. Stories of grave torture, of women brutally violated, people who have had their loved ones killed before their eyes. Children who have seen their grandparents locked in houses that were set alight.\n> \n> \n> I am a mother, and I saw my children in the eyes of every single refugee child I met. I saw myself in every parent. How can any mother endure seeing her child thrown into a fire?\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n– Part of Blanchett's address to the United Nations Security Council about the Rohingya refugee crisis in August 2018.[265]\n\nBlanchett has been working with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) since 2015. In May 2016, the UNHCR announced her appointment as a global Goodwill Ambassador.[266] Blanchett, along with other celebrities, featured in a video from the UNHCR to help raise awareness to the global refugee crisis. The video, titled \"What They Took With Them\", has the actors reading a poem written by Jenifer Toksvig and inspired by primary accounts of refugees, and is part of UNHCR's \"WithRefugees\" campaign, which also includes a petition to governments to expand asylum to provide further shelter, integrating job opportunities, and education.[267][268]\n\n\nBlanchett has undertaken missions with the UNHCR to Jordan in 2015, Lebanon in 2016 and Bangladesh in 2018 to meet with and highlight the issues faced by both Syrian and Rohingya refugees in those areas.[269] In January 2018, she was awarded the Crystal Award at the World Economic Forum to honour her advocacy for refugees and displaced people around the world,[270] and in August 2018, she addressed the United Nations Security Council about the atrocities committed against the Rohingya people in Myanmar.[271]\n\n\nIn July 2020, the Australian miniseries *Stateless*, which was co-created and produced by Blanchett (and originally aired on the ABC network in Australia), premiered on Netflix. The series was inspired by Blanchett's work with the UNHCR and focuses on four strangers whose lives collide at an immigration detention centre in Australia. In Blanchett's words, the show's aim is to \"build empathy and understanding for refugees, particularly those who have been and still are in detention.\"[272]\n\n\n\nAs an esteemed member of the performing arts community that was seriously impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and a person concerned about environmental and humanitarian issues, Blanchett contributed an essay to *Upturn: A Better Normal After COVID-19*, a book published in 2020 about what could be done to improve society after the pandemic in her native Australia.[273][274] Blanchett said:\n\n\n> We engage with the performance of the gesture and the whole of it is greater than the sum of its parts. I think this need to gather is fundamental to who we are, and it has been stymied by Covid-19 but also underlined by it, and that need in us for community addresses the difficult lesson we have to learn: business is not government and government is not a business.[274]\n> \n> \n\n\nIn May 2020, Blanchett was among the celebrities who read an installment of Roald Dahl's children's fantasy novel *James and the Giant Peach* in aid of the global-non profit charity Partners In Health, co-founded by Dahl's daughter Ophelia, which had been fighting COVID-19 in vulnerable areas.[275]\n\n\nIn September 2020, Blanchett, Helen Mirren, Eddie Redmayne, Salman Rushdie and other figures of British cultural life support the protests of University for Theater and Film Arts (SZFE) students in Budapest against changes ushered Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s government that forced a transfer of control of the public institution to a private foundation and a new structure to guide key decisions at the storied SZFE.[276][277]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Blanchett at the Inaugural AACTA Awards in 2012\nBlanchett is married to playwright and screenwriter Andrew Upton. They met in Australia in the mid-1990s and married on 29 December 1997.[282] They have three sons,[283][284][285] and a daughter, who was adopted in 2015.[286][287] Blanchett said that she and her husband had wanted to adopt since the birth of their first son.[288]\n\n\nAfter making Brighton, England, their main family home for nearly 10 years, she and her husband returned to their native Australia in 2006.[289][290] In November 2006, Blanchett attributed the move to their desire to select a permanent home for her children, to be closer to her family, and to have a sense of belonging to the Australian theatrical community.[291] She and her family lived in the Sydney suburb of Hunters Hill,[292] extensively renovating their home in 2007 to be more eco-friendly.[293] Following its sale in 2015, she and Upton purchased a house in Crowborough, East Sussex, England, in early 2016.[294]\n\n\nBlanchett has spoken about feminism and politics, telling Sky News in 2013 that she was concerned that \"a wave of conservatism sweeping the globe\" was threatening women's role in society.[295] She has also commented on the pressures women in Hollywood face now: \"Honestly, I think about my appearance less than I did ten years ago. People talk about the golden age of Hollywood because of how women were lit then. You could be Joan Crawford and Bette Davis and work well into your 50s, because you were lit and made into a goddess. Now, with everything being sort of gritty, women have this sense of their use-by date.\"[296]\n\n\nBlanchett was the first ambassador and has been a patron of the Australian Film Institute and its academy, the Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts, since 2001.[297] She is also a patron of the Sydney Film Festival.[298] Blanchett is a patron of the new Australian Pavilion in the Venice Biennale, and spoke at its opening at the Venice Giardini in May 2015.[299] Blanchett spoke at former Prime Minister of Australia Gough Whitlam's state funeral in 2014, and at the Margaret Whitlam dinner and fundraiser event hosted by politician Tanya Plibersek in June 2015.[300]\n\n\nBlanchett became a spokeswoman for and the face of SK-II, the luxury skin care brand owned by Procter & Gamble, in 2005,[301][302] and brand ambassador for Giorgio Armani fragrances for women in 2013, being paid $10 million for the latter.[303] In 2018 Armani announced Blanchett would become the first beauty ambassador for the company, representing the company globally by absorbing responsibilities for skincare and make-up, in addition to her previous 2013 commitments to fragrances.[304][305] In 2022, Louis Vuitton announced Blanchett as its new house ambassador.[306]\n\n\n\n## Acting credits and awards[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Cate Blanchett on screen and stage and List of awards and nominations received by Cate Blanchett\n\n![](image)Blanchett's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame\nBlanchett has appeared in over 70 films and over 20 theatre productions.

His mother, Phyllis Jones, was a nurse, while his father, Rhys Davies, was a mechanical engineer and colonial officer.[2]\n\n\nDue to his father's work as a colonial police officer, he was raised in Tanganyika (today part of Tanzania) before his family moved to the Welsh town of Ammanford.[1] While in Tanganyika, his family lived in places such as Dar es Salaam, Kongwa, Moshi, and Mwanza. He was educated at independent Truro School in Cornwall and then at the University of East Anglia, where he was one of the first 105 students admitted and became a co-founder of its drama club. After a stint teaching at a secondary school in Watton, Norfolk, he won a place at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London.\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rhys-Davies (right) signing autographs in May 2005\nRhys-Davies appeared sporadically on UK television in the early 1970s, including his role as the gangster \"Laughing Spam Fritter\" opposite Adam Faith in *Budgie*. Later he played Praetorian officer Naevius Sutorius Macro in *I, Claudius*. He then began to appear more frequently, and not just in the UK, with roles as a Portuguese navigator Rodrigues in the 1980 television miniseries *Shogun*, based on the novel by James Clavell, and as Sallah in the 1981 film *Raiders of the Lost Ark*.[3] He reprised the role of Sallah in two subsequent *Indiana Jones* films.[4]\n\n\nIn 1989, he played Marvel Comics character Kingpin in *The Trial of the Incredible Hulk*.[5] Rhys-Davies also starred in another Clavell adaption, *Noble House*, set in Hong Kong, in which he plays Ian Dunross' corporate enemy, Quillan Gornt.[6] He has since appeared in numerous television shows and miniseries, including Agent Michael Malone in the 1993 remake of the 1950s television series *The Untouchables*[7] as well as a leading role in the television series *Sliders* as Professor Maximillian Arturo from 1995 to 1997.[8]\n\n\n\n![](image)John Rhys Davies at Galaxy Con Richmond in 2023\nHe also appeared in *Reilly, Ace of Spies* in 1983, made several appearances in *Star Trek: Voyager* as a holodeck version of Leonardo da Vinci,[9] starred as an ally of James Bond in *The Living Daylights*, and appeared in the film *One Night with the King*. Davies has played the character Porthos in two separate projects; a two-part episode of *The Secret Adventures of Jules Verne*, and the Hallmark Channel film *La Femme Musketeer*. He appears in the full motion video cut scenes of computer games including *Ripper* (as Vigo Haman) (1996), *Dune 2000* (as Noree Moneo) (1998), and the *Wing Commander* series (as James Taggart, doubling as the voice of Thrakhath nar Kiranka in the third game of the series).\n\n\nIn 2004, he narrated *The Privileged Planet*, a documentary that makes the case for intelligent design.[10] He also provided narration in the MTV series Wildboyz around this time. In 2013, he appeared in the family history programme *Coming Home*, in which he discovered information about his grandfather's life in the Carmarthenshire coal mines.[11]\n\n\nIn 2014, he joined the cast of the television show *Metal Hurlant Chronicles* to play Holgarth, an immortal alchemist.[12]\n\n\nIn 2015, he had a role in the single-player campaign of the PC game *Star Citizen* alongside Mark Hamill and Gary Oldman.[13] The work consisted of full body motion capture, including facial expressions and his voice; it was recorded primarily at the Imaginarium studios in the UK.[14]\n\n\n\n### *The Lord of the Rings* trilogy[edit]\n\n\nRhys-Davies appeared as the dwarf Gimli in *The Lord of the Rings* trilogy. The cinematography of the films was aided in that Rhys-Davies is tall – 6 ft 1 in (1.85 m), compared to the actors playing hobbits at around 5 ft 6 in (1.68 m).[15] Therefore, although his character was supposed to be short, he was properly in proportion compared to the hobbit actors. Had he been of more similar height, shots of the entire fellowship would have required three camera passes rather than two.[16]\n\n\nRhys-Davies is the only one of the nine Fellowship of the Ring actors who did not receive a tattoo of the word \"nine\" written in the Tengwar script; his stunt double, Brett Beattie, was offered the tattoo instead as Rhys-Davies was disinclined to get one himself and Beattie had spent so much time as his double that he almost received co-credit.[17]\n\n\nRhys-Davies suffered severe reactions to the prosthetics used during filming, and his eyes sometimes swelled shut. When asked whether he would consider returning to the role for the film version of *The Hobbit*, he said, \"I have already completely ruled it out. There's a sentimental part of me that would love to be involved again. Really I am not sure my face can take that sort of punishment any more.\" He added that this time around \"[t]hey've got a different set of problems ... because you've got 13 dwarves, a whole band of them ... You're trying to represent a whole race ... You're trying to do for dwarves what *The Lord of the Rings* did for hobbits.\"[18] He offered help as a dwarf advisor in 2011, but ruled out returning as Gimli in *The Hobbit* because of the punishing makeup required.[19]\n\n\n\n### Voice work[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rhys-Davies in September 2012\nIn addition to voicing the Ent Treebeard in *Lord of the Rings*, Rhys-Davies has lent his distinctive voice to many video games and animated television series, including the role of Hades in *Justice League*, the original voice of Man Ray in *SpongeBob SquarePants* (until both roles were recast to Bob Joles), and numerous times in *Gargoyles* (1994–1996), as the character Macbeth. He also lent his vocal talents to the games *Freelancer* (as Richard Winston Tobias) and *Lords of Everquest* (both in 2003) and the game *Quest for Glory IV: Shadows of Darkness*, which was released with his narration on a CD-ROM version in 1995. He also had a voice role on *Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance* as the character Jherek, and narrated a documentary called *The Glory of Macedonia*. Next Generation magazine gave its *Dune 2000* review 'an automatic one-star deduction for featuring John \"Multimedia Whore\" Rhys-Davies in the FMV.'[20]\n\n\nJohn Rhys-Davies' voice can be heard on the 2009 documentary *Reclaiming The Blade*.[21] In the narration, Rhys-Davies explores swords, historical European swordsmanship and fight choreography on film, a topic very familiar to him from his experiences in *The Lord of the Rings* trilogy, where his character wielded an axe in many scenes.\n\n\nIn 2004, he was the unknowing subject of an internet prank that spread false rumours in several mainstream media sources that he was scheduled to play the role of General Grievous in *Star Wars Episode III*.[22]\n\n\nRhys-Davies is the narrator of *The Truth & Life Dramatized audio New Testament Bible*, a 22-hour, celebrity-voiced, fully dramatised audiobook version of the New Testament which uses the Revised Standard Version-Catholic Edition translation. In 2011, he presented *KJB: The Book That Changed The World*, which features him reading diverse snippets from the King James Version.\n\n\nJohn Rhys-Davies’ voice work also includes voice-over work with *Breathe Bible*.[23]\n\n\nIn 2016, he provided spoken words for *Voices of Fire*, the sixth album by a cappella power metal band van Canto.[24]\n\n\nA resident of the Isle of Man since 1988, John Rhys-Davies provides the introductory voice-over to the Island's Castle Rushen, one of the best-preserved medieval fortresses in the British Isles. In 2018, he lent his voice to the Isle of Man's tourism commercial.\n\n\nRhys-Davies voice was recorded for some of the callouts in the 1993 Williams SuperPin *Indiana Jones: The Pinball Adventure*[25]\n\n\n  \n\nIn the 2023 game Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria, he reprises the role of voicing Gimli and can be heard narrating the opening scene.\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### Relationships[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rhys-Davies in April 2013\nRhys-Davies married Suzanne Wilkinson in December 1966, and they had two sons together. Although they legally separated in 1985, they remained married until her death from Alzheimer's disease in 2010. They remained friends, and he took care of her in her final years.[26]\n\n\nIn 2004, Rhys-Davies began dating Lisa Manning. They have a daughter together, and split their time between homes in the New Zealand region of Waikato[27] and on the Isle of Man.[28]\n\n\n\n### Religious views[edit]\n\n\nRhys-Davies is a self-described \"rationalist\" and \"sceptic\" when it comes to religion. However, he holds Christianity in high regard and has stated that \"Christian civilisation has made the world a better place than it ever was.\"\n\n\nIn February 2020, Rhys-Davies stated, \"All the things that we value, the right of free speech, the right of the individual conscience, these evolved in first and second century Roman Christendom, where the individual Christian said, 'I have a right to believe, what I believe and not what the Emperor tells me.' From that our whole idea of democracy and the equality that we have has developed. We owe Christianity the greatest debt of thanks that a generation can ever have, and to slight it and to dismiss it as being irrelevant is the detritus of rather ill-read minds, I think.\"[29][30]\n\n\n\n### Political views[edit]\n\n\nRhys-Davies is not a member of any political party. He was a radical leftist as a university student in the 1960s, but changed his views when he went to heckle Margaret Thatcher, who he said \"shot down the first two hecklers in such brilliant fashion that [he] decided [he] ought for once to shut up and listen\".[31]\n\n\nIn 2004, Rhys-Davies said in an interview with *World* magazine, \"There is a demographic catastrophe happening in Europe that nobody wants to talk about, that we daren't bring up because we are so cagey about not offending people racially. And rightly we should be. But there is a cultural thing as well. By 2020, 50% of the children in Holland under the age of 18 will be of Muslim descent.\"[32] In an interview with the conservative journal *National Review*, he said that he is opposed to Islamic extremism because he feels that it violates the \"Western values\" of equality, democracy, tolerance, and the abolition of slavery.[31]\n\n\nRhys-Davies was vocal about his support for Brexit.[33] On 25 April 2019, he appeared as a panelist on the BBC's *Question Time*, where he debated Donald Trump's victory in the 2016 U.S. presidential election with Green Party politician Caroline Lucas. After Lucas suggested Trump should not be afforded a state visit to the UK, due to having lost the popular vote, Rhys-Davies banged his hands on the table and shouted \"“Oh woman! Have you never read Kenneth Arrow and the Arrows theorem?\" His conduct was subsequently described as \"thuggish and sexist\" by some viewers.[34][35] Rhys-Davies has since commented on his response, saying \"I was annoyed. It’s impossible to gather your thoughts when you’ve got someone making faces and twittering. It’s like having a fly butting around your face.\"[36]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Film\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1973\n | *Penny Gold* | Rugby Player\n |  |\n| 1974\n | *The Black Windmill* | Fake Military Policeman\n | Uncredited\n |\n| 1975\n | *The Naked Civil Servant* | Barndoor\n |  |\n| 1979\n | *A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square* | Solicitor\n |  |\n| 1981\n | *Raiders of the Lost Ark* | Sallah |  |\n| 1982\n | *Best Revenge* | Mustapha\n |  |\n| *Victor/Victoria* | Andre Cassell\n |  |\n| *The Island of Adventure* | Smith\n |  |\n| 1983\n | *Sahara* | Rasoul\n |  |\n| *Sadat* | Gamal Abdel Nasser |  |\n| 1984\n | *Sword of the Valiant* | Baron Fortinbras\n |  |\n| *Kim* | Babu\n |  |\n| 1985\n | *King Solomon's Mines* | Dogati\n |  |\n| 1986\n | *Firewalker* | \"Corky\" Taylor\n |  |\n| 1987\n | *The Living Daylights* | General Leonid Pushkin |  |\n| 1988\n | *Waxwork* | Werewolf\n |  |\n| 1989\n | *Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade* | Sallah\n |  |\n| *Rising Storm* | Donwaldo\n |  |\n| 1992\n | *The Double 0 Kid* | Rudi Von Keseenbaum\n |  |\n| *The Lost World* | Professor Challenger |  |\n| *Return to the Lost World* | Professor Challenger\n |  |\n| 1993\n | *Sunset Grill* | Stockton\n |  |\n| *Cyborg Cop* | Kessel\n |  |\n| *The Seventh Coin* | Captain Galil\n |  |\n| *The Unnamable II: The Statement of Randolph Carter* | Professor Warren\n |  |\n| 1994\n | *The High Crusade* | Bruder Parvus\n |  |\n| *Robot in the Family* | Eli Taki / Rashmud / Sashri\n |  |\n| *Blood of the Innocent* | Captain Shmuda\n |  |\n| 1996\n | *The Great White Hype* | Johnny Windsor\n |  |\n| *Glory Daze* | Luther\n |  |\n| *Aladdin and the King of Thieves* | Cassim | Voice, direct-to-video[37] |\n| *Marquis de Sade* | Inspector Marais\n |  |\n| 1997\n | *Cats Don't Dance* | Woolie the Mammoth\n | Voice[37] |\n| *Bloodsport III* | Jacques Duvalier\n |  |\n| *The Protector* | Rasheed\n |  |\n| 1999\n | *Secret of the Andes* | Father Claver\n |  |\n| 2000\n | *Sinbad: Beyond the Veil of Mists* | King Akron, Baraka\n | Voice\n |\n| *Delta Force One: The Lost Patrol* | Ivan\n |  |\n| 2001\n | *Never Say Never Mind: The Swedish Bikini Team* | Hakim\n |  |\n| *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring* | Gimli |  |\n| 2002\n | *Sabretooth* | Anthony Bricklin\n |  |\n| *Endangered Species* | Lieutenant Wyznowski\n |  |\n| *Scorcher* | Matthew Sallin\n |  |\n| *The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers* | Gimli, Treebeard |  |\n| 2003\n | *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* |  |\n| *Coronado* | President Hugo Luis Ramos\n |  |\n| *The Jungle Book 2* | Ranjan's Father\n | Voice[37] |\n| *The Medallion* | Commander Hammerstock-Smythe\n |  |\n| 2004\n | *12 Days of Terror* | Captain\n |  |\n| *The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement* | Viscount Mabrey\n |  |\n| *La Femme Musketeer* | Porthos |  |\n| *The Lost Angel* | Father Kevin\n |  |\n| *The Privileged Planet* | The Narrator\n | Voice\n |\n| 2005\n | *The Game of Their Lives* | Bill Jeffrey\n |  |\n| *Chupacabra Terror* | Captain Randolph\n |  |\n| *The King Maker* | Phillippe\n |  |\n| 2006\n | *Shark Bait* | Thorton\n | Voice, English dub[37] |\n| *One Night with the King* | Mordecai |  |\n| *The Legend of Sasquatch* | Ranger Steve\n | Voice[37] |\n| 2007\n | *In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale* | Merick\n |  |\n| *The Ferryman* | The Greek\n |  |\n| *Catching Kringle* | Santa | Voice\n |\n| 2009\n | *Reclaiming the Blade* | The Narrator\n | Voice\n |\n| *31 North 62 East* | John Hammond\n |  |\n| 2010\n | *Tom and Jerry Meet Sherlock Holmes* | Dr. Watson | Voice, direct-to-video[37] |\n| 2011\n | *KJB: The Book That Changed the World* | Self / Presenter\n |  |\n| *Sophie and Sheba* | Alistair Winston\n |  |\n| *Treasure Hunters* | Nathan Pickett\n |  |\n| *Ferocious Planet* | Senator Jackson Crenshaw\n |  |\n| 2012\n | *Escape* | Malcolm Andrews\n |  |\n| 2013\n | *100 Degrees Below Zero* | Ralph Dillard\n |  |\n| *Scooby-Doo!

He is best known for playing Meriadoc \"Merry\" Brandybuck in Peter Jackson's film trilogy *The Lord of the Rings* (2001–2003), and Charlie Pace on the ABC television drama *Lost* (2004–2010).\n\n\nMonaghan first gained fame as Hetty Wainthropp's sidekick Geoffrey in *Hetty Wainthropp Investigates* (1996–1998). His first film role was as Sasha in the television film *Hostile Waters* (1997) based on the true story of a Soviet and a US submarine colliding in the Cold War. His other film roles include playing the young mutant Chris Bradley formerly known as Maverick in the superhero film *X-Men Origins: Wolverine* (2009) and playing Beaumont Kin in *Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker* (2019), reuniting with J.J. Abrams, the co-creator of *Lost.* He also has hosted the nature programme *Wild Things with Dominic Monaghan* (2012–2016).\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nMonaghan was born in West Berlin, West Germany, to British parents: Maureen, a nurse, and Austin Monaghan, who was of Irish descent, a science teacher.[3] Monaghan's family lived in Berlin, Düsseldorf, Stuttgart and Münster, moving about every four years. When he was about 11 years old, his family moved to Heaton Moor in Stockport, England.[4] In Stockport, he attended St Anne's Roman Catholic High School (where his uncle taught and later became head teacher) and Aquinas College, where he studied English literature, drama and geography.\n\n\n\n## Career and events[edit]\n\n\nAlthough Monaghan held many occupations when he was younger, he long wanted to be an actor. After his second year at St Anne's, Monaghan became a regular in school plays such as *Oliver Twist*, *A Christmas Carol* and *Bugsy Malone* before joining the Manchester Youth Theatre. There, he was scouted for *Hetty Wainthropp Investigates*, in which he starred alongside Patricia Routledge and Derek Benfield as Hetty's under-aged sidekick, Geoffrey Shawcross, for four series. Monaghan has since credited Routledge as \"an amazing teacher\" who taught him some \"very valuable lessons\" that have influenced his acting career.[5][6][*non-primary source needed*] He made his feature-film debut as Russian sailor Sasha in the TV film *Hostile Waters*.[7]\n\n\nMonaghan later starred in *The Lord of the Rings* film trilogy as Meriadoc Brandybuck, for which he achieved international acclaim and success. Monaghan narrated *Ringers: Lord of the Fans*, a documentary about *The Lord of the Rings* fandom. He also provided the narration for The Discovery Channel's documentary *Devil's Bible* in 2008. He also appeared in *Soldiers of Fortune* alongside Sean Bean and Christian Slater. \nHe was a regular cast member on the ABC series *Lost* from 2004 to 2007, playing English former rockstar and drug addict Charlie Pace. Monaghan originally auditioned for the role of Sawyer. The role of Charlie was then changed from an old, washed up rocker from the 1980s, to a young one-hit wonder to accommodate Monaghan's age. Monaghan returned to the series as a special guest star after departing from the main cast.\n\n\nIn 2009, Monaghan starred as Chris Bradley / Bolt in *X-Men Origins: Wolverine*. On 15 July 2009, it was confirmed that he would join the cast of ABC Studios' science-fiction television series *FlashForward* as the character Simon. The series premiered on 24 September 2009.[8] It was cancelled after its first season.[9]\n\n\nOn 18 March 2010, Monaghan was spotted at the Universal Sheraton filming a short titled *Gloria*. It was part of a programme titled REESES Puff's Extraordinary Cinema (where the teenagers replace the pros[*clarification needed*]). He played the part of Caleb Reese.[10][11]\n\n\nIn 2010, Monaghan and US actress Megan Fox made an appearance as a couple in an abusive relationship in the music video for Rihanna and Eminem's song \"Love the Way You Lie\". Scenes include the celebrities on top of a liquor store. Fox and Monaghan also filmed inside the store and \"at a seedy dive bar next door\" to the store.[12]\n\n\nIn November 2012, a new show on Channel 5 titled *Wild Things with Dominic Monaghan* started airing in the United Kingdom. The documentary shows Monaghan travelling to different locations such as Venezuela and Ecuador to film and interact with the exotic and often dangerous local wildlife.[13]\n\n\nDuring the summer of 2013, Monaghan appeared in various live-action teasers for 2K Marin's science-fiction video game *The Bureau: XCOM Declassified*.[14]\n\n\nMonaghan is a fan of *The Gaffer Tapes: Fantasy Football Podcast* and has appeared as a guest in both April-November 2016 and May 2018, as well as submitting several audio questions which are played on the podcast. While appearing as a guest, Monaghan said \"It's the best fantasy football podcast out there\".[15]\n\n\nMonaghan is a contributing writer for the music and culture magazine *Paste*, primarily writing articles about Premier League football.[16]\n\n\nMonaghan is the voice of Sightseeing Manchester's bus tour, recorded in March 2016.\n\n\nSince August 2018, he has been starring as a serial killer in Channel 9 Australia's murder-mystery/drama TV series *Bite Club*, which is filmed in and around Sydney.\n\n\nHe was named as part of the cast for the last film in the sequel trilogy which is *Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker*, reuniting with J.J. Abrams, the co-creator of *Lost*. He appeared as Beaumont.\n\n\nIn May 2020, Monaghan joined together with fellow *Lord of the Rings* castmates Sean Astin, Sean Bean, Orlando Bloom, Billy Boyd, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Miranda Otto, John Rhys-Davies, Andy Serkis, Liv Tyler, Karl Urban, and Elijah Wood, along with writer Philippa Boyens and director Peter Jackson, to appear on Josh Gad's YouTube series *Reunited Apart,* which reunites the cast of popular films through video-conferencing, and promotes donations to non-profit charities.[17] Monaghan and castmate Billy Boyd started the podcast *The Friendship Onion* where they talk about their time filming *The Lord of the Rings*.\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nMonaghan is a nature lover and has been active in the planting of trees and cacti. He bought a mango-tree forest in India.[18] Monaghan has a great love for insects and reptiles that he developed during his childhood, and has kept an exotic assortment of pets, including a leaf-mantis named Gizmo, a black widow spider named Witchitar and an albino snake named Blink.[19] The newly discovered species of spider *Ctenus monaghani* (de:Ctenus monaghani) is named after him.[20]\n\n\nAn avid outdoorsman, Monaghan enjoys activities such as surfing, kayaking, snowboarding, football, basketball and hiking. He has also explained that he likes hunting for insects and reptiles outdoors. He learned karate as a child, used to practise yoga and often goes to the gym for strength and weight training. He is a longtime fan of Manchester United since his childhood.[21]\n\n\nMonaghan loves to play all games and has hosted game nights for fellow cast members in the past, and is also fond of *The New York Times*' crossword puzzle. He enjoys playing *League of Legends* with fellow *Lord of the Rings* cast member Billy Boyd. He is fluent in English and German.[22]\n\n\nOn his right arm he has a tattoo of the English word \"nine\" written in the artificial script of Tengwar, a reference to his involvement in *The Lord of the Rings* and the fact that his character was one of the nine members of the Fellowship of the Ring. Seven other cast members and John Rhys-Davies' stunt double also got matching tattoos during the film's production, at Monaghan's instigation. Below that tattoo is another that reads, \"Life imitates art\", an Oscar Wilde quote. On his left arm is a tattoo, \"Living is easy with eyes closed\", a line from The Beatles' \"Strawberry Fields Forever\". He also has two stars tattooed on his left foot: one black, and one white.[23] In 2010, Monaghan got two more tattoos, one on the upper side of the back (\"Love you take is equal to the love you make\", taken from the song \"The End\" by The Beatles). The other, done by Kat Von D on the reality TV series *LA Ink*, is located on his lower right arm and reads \"Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter\", a quote from Yoda.\n\n\nHe resides in Los Angeles, California. In 2008, Monaghan held a photographic exhibition in Los Angeles in which he sold prints of his own works. A portion of the proceeds from the exhibition were given to an orangutan rescue organisation.\n\n\nMonaghan was in a relationship with his *Lost* co-star Evangeline Lilly from 2004 until 2007.[24]\n\n\nIn June 2008, Monaghan travelled to Argentina with Lilly to film the pilot of the US version of *CQC*.[25]\n\n\nMonaghan provided the inspiration for the naming of Billy Boyd's band Beecake after he sent his friend a picture of a cake covered in bees.[26]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n### Films[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2001\n | *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring* | Meriadoc Brandybuck | Phoenix Film Critics Society Award for Best CastNominated—Empire Award for Best NewcomerNominated—Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture |\n| 2002\n | *The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers* | Phoenix Film Critics Society Award for Best CastNominated—Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture |\n| 2003\n | *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* | Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Acting EnsembleNational Board of Review Award for Best CastOnline Film Critics Society Award for Best CastScreen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion PictureNominated—Phoenix Film Critics Society Award for Best Cast\n |\n| *An Insomniac's Nightmare* | Jack\n | Short film\n |\n| 2004\n | *Spivs* | Goat\n |  |\n| *The Purifiers* | Sol\n |  |\n| 2005\n | *Ringers: Lord of the Fans* | Narrator\n | Voice\n |\n| *Shooting Livien* | Owen Scott\n |  |\n| 2008\n | *I Sell the Dead* | Arthur Blake\n |  |\n| 2009\n | *X-Men Origins: Wolverine* | Chris Bradley | Nominated—People's Choice Award for Favorite On-Screen Team |\n| 2011\n | *The Day* | Rick\n |  |\n| 2012\n | *The Millionaire Tour* | Casper\n |  |\n| *Soldiers of Fortune* | Tommy Sin\n |  |\n| 2015\n | *Molly Moon and the Incredible Book of Hypnotism* | Nockman\n |  |\n| 2016\n | *Pet* | Seth\n |  |\n| 2017\n | *Atomica* | Robinson Scott\n |  |\n| 2018\n | *Mute* | Oswald\n |  |\n| *Waterlily Jaguar* | Bill\n |  |\n| 2019\n | *Radioflash* | Chris\n |  |\n| 2019\n | *Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker* | Beaumont Kin\n |  |\n| 2021\n | *Edge of the World* | Colonel Arthur Crookshank\n |  |\n| 2022\n | *Last Looks* | Warren Gomes\n |  |\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1996–98\n | *Hetty Wainthropp Investigates* | Geoffrey Shawcross\n | 27 episodes\n |\n| 1997\n | *Hostile Waters* | Sasha\n | Television film\n |\n| 2000\n | *This Is Personal: The Hunt for the Yorkshire Ripper* | Jimmy Furey\n |\n| *Monsignor Renard* | Etienne Pierre Rollinger\n | 3 episodes\n |\n| 2004\n | *I Love the '90s* | Himself\n | Commentator\n |\n| 2004–2010\n | *Lost* | Charlie Pace | 65 episodesScreen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama SeriesNominated—Monte-Carlo Television Festival Award for Outstanding Actor – Drama SeriesNominated—Prism Award for Performance in a Drama SeriesNominated—Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor on Television |\n| 2005\n | *I Love the '90s: Part Deux* | Himself\n | Commentator\n |\n| 2008\n | *MADtv* | Himself\n | 2 episodes\n |\n| *Caiga Quien Caiga* | Episode: \"#12.15\"\n |\n| 2009\n | *Chuck* | Tyler Martin\n | Episode: \"Chuck Versus the Third Dimension\"\n |\n| 2009–2010\n | *FlashForward* | Dr. Simon Campos\n | 15 episodes\n |\n| 2010\n | *Top Gear* | Himself\n | 2 episodes\n |\n| 2012\n | *The Unknown* | Mark Nickel\n | 6 episodes\n |\n| *Childrens Hospital* | Dr. Owen Maestro\n | \"British Hospital\"\n |\n| 2012–2016\n | *Wild Things with Dominic Monaghan* | Himself\n | 30 episodesNominated—Canadian Screen Award for Best Science or Nature Documentary Program/SeriesNominated—Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Reality SeriesNominated—OFTA Award for Best Host or Panelist in a Non-Fiction ProgramNominated—Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Unstructured Reality Program |\n| 2013\n | *Ridiculousness* | \"Dominic Monaghan\"\n |\n| *The Eric Andre Show* | \"Krysten Ritter/Dominic Monaghan\"\n |\n| 2015\n | *100 Code* | Tommy Conley\n | 12 episodes\n |\n| 2017\n | *Sofia the First* | Fig\n | Voice;

He made his breakthrough as the character Legolas in *The Lord of the Rings* film series. He reprised his role in *The Hobbit* film series. Considered by some to be the Errol Flynn of his time,[4][5][6] he gained further notice appearing in epic fantasy, historical, and adventure films, notably as Will Turner in the *Pirates of the Caribbean* film series, Paris in *Troy* (2004), Balian de Ibelin in *Kingdom of Heaven* (2005), and the Duke of Buckingham in *The Three Musketeers* (2011).\n\n\nBloom appeared in Hollywood films such as the war film *Black Hawk Down* (2001), the Australian Western *Ned Kelly* (2003), the romantic comedy *Elizabethtown* (2005), and *New York, I Love You* (2007). In 2020 he gained acclaim for the Afghanistan War drama film *The Outpost* (2020). He also starred in the Amazon Prime Video series *Carnival Row* (2019–2023).\n\n\nHe made his professional stage debut in *In Celebration* at the Duke of York's Theatre in the West End in 2007 and starred in a Broadway adaptation of William Shakespeare's *Romeo and Juliet* in 2013. He returned to the theatre in a West End revival of Tracy Letts' *Killer Joe* in 2018. In 2009, Bloom was named a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. In 2015 he received the BAFTA Britannia Humanitarian Award.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nBloom was born on 13 January 1977 in Canterbury, Kent, and was named after the 16th-century English composer Orlando Gibbons.[8][9] He has an older sister, Samantha Bloom.[10]\n\n\nBloom initially believed that his biological father was his mother's husband, the South African-born anti-apartheid novelist Harry Bloom (1913–1981), who died when Bloom was four years old. However, when he was thirteen, Bloom's mother revealed to him that his biological father was actually Colin Stone, his mother's partner and family friend.[11][12][13] Stone, the principal of the Concorde International language school,[14] became Orlando Bloom's legal guardian after Harry Bloom's death.[13]\n\n\nBloom's mother, Sonia Constance Josephine (*née* Copeland), was born in Kolkata, India, the daughter of British parents Francis John Copeland, a physician and surgeon, and Betty Constance Josephine (*née* Walker), who were from Kent. Through her, Bloom is a cousin of photographer Sebastian Copeland.[15][16] Bloom's mother's family lived in Tasmania (Australia), Japan, and India.[11]\n\n\nBloom was brought up in the Church of England.[17] He attended St Peter's Methodist Primary School,[18] then the junior school of The King's School before proceeding to St Edmund's School Canterbury. Bloom was discovered to be dyslexic,[13][19] and was encouraged by his mother to take art and drama classes.[13] After being spurred into action following his school prize submission to panto actor Richard Sieben in 1992, in 1993, he moved to London to follow a two-year A-Level course in Drama, Photography and Sculpture at Fine Arts College, Hampstead. He then joined the National Youth Theatre, spending two seasons there and earning a scholarship to train at the British American Drama Academy.[20] Bloom began acting professionally with television roles in episodes of *Casualty* and *Midsomer Murders*,[13] and subsequently made his film debut in *Wilde* (1997), opposite Stephen Fry, before entering the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London, where he studied acting.[21]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nBloom's first appearance on the screen was in a small role, as a rent boy, in the 1997 film *Wilde*. Two days after graduating from Guildhall in 1999,[22] he was cast in his first major role, playing Legolas in *The Lord of the Rings* film trilogy (2001–2003).[20] He had originally auditioned for the part of Faramir, who does not appear until the second movie, but the director, Peter Jackson, cast him as Legolas instead. While shooting a scene, he broke a rib after falling off a horse, but eventually recovered and continued shooting.[23] At the same time, Bloom also played a brief role in Ridley Scott's war film *Black Hawk Down* as PFC Todd Blackburn. In 2002, he was chosen as one of the *Teen People* \"25 Hottest Stars Under 25\", despite him having turned 25, and was named *People*'s hottest Hollywood bachelor in the magazine's 2004 list.[20] All members of the cast of the Rings films were nominated for Best Ensemble Acting at the Screen Actors Guild Awards for three years in a row, finally winning in 2003 for the third film, *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King*. Bloom has also won other awards, including European Film Awards, Hollywood Festival Award, Empire Awards and Teen Choice Awards, and has been nominated for many others. Most of Bloom's box office successes have been as part of an ensemble cast.[24]\n\n\n\n![](image)Bloom at the 2005 Venice Film Festival\nBloom next starred opposite Keira Knightley and Johnny Depp in *Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl*, which was a blockbuster hit during the summer of 2003. After the success of *Pirates*, Bloom next took to the screen as Paris, the man who effectively started the Trojan War, in the 2004 Spring blockbuster, *Troy* opposite Brad Pitt, Eric Bana and Peter O'Toole. He subsequently played the lead roles in Ridley Scott's *Kingdom of Heaven* and Cameron Crowe's *Elizabethtown* (both 2005). In 2006, Bloom starred in sequel *Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest* and in the independently made *Haven*, of which he was also executive producer. In the same year he was one of the guest stars in the sitcom *Extras*, in which he portrayed an exaggeratedly arrogant, narcissistic version of himself who had a great loathing for Johnny Depp (his co-star in *Pirates of the Caribbean*); Bloom pushed for *Extras* to go further by making his part unlikable, and contributed to the gag about him admiring Depp out of sheer jealousy, that Depp was far more talented than he was, not to mention rated higher than him on the 'top hottest' charts.[25] Also in 2006, Bloom was the most searched male on Google News.[13] As of May 2007, Bloom has appeared in four of the top 15 highest-grossing films of all time.[22]\n\n\nBloom then again portrayed Will Turner, in *Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End*, released on 24 May 2007. Bloom, who had intended to become a stage actor after graduating from the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, had stated that he would like to leave films for a time and instead appear in stage roles,[20] and is \"avidly looking for the right sort of material that [he] can do something with\"[26] and go \"back to basics.\"[27] During the summer of 2007, he appeared in a London revival of *In Celebration*, a play by David Storey.[27][28] His character was one of three brothers returning home for their parents' 40th wedding anniversary.[29] On 24 August 2007 he made his first ever TV commercial appearance on late-night Japanese TV, promoting the Uno brand of cosmetics maker Shiseido. A \"one night only\", 2-minute version of the Sci-Fi themed commercial kicked off the product's marketing campaign.[30] In 2008 he signed on to play a small role in the British film *An Education*[31] but dropped out to take the lead in Johnnie To's film *Red Circle*. Also in 2009, he was one of many stars to appear in *New York, I Love You*, which contained 12 short films in one.\n\n\n\n![](image)Bloom at the 2010 *Cinema for Peace* gala in Berlin, Germany\nBloom appeared in *The Three Musketeers* opposite Milla Jovovich, Logan Lerman, Matthew Macfadyen, Ray Stevenson, Luke Evans, Juno Temple and Christoph Waltz, released in 2011. Bloom reprised his role as Legolas in parts two and three of *The Hobbit*, Peter Jackson's three-part prequel to *The Lord of the Rings* trilogy.[32] He made his Broadway stage debut as Romeo in *Romeo and Juliet* in August 2013 at the Richard Rodgers Theatre.[33] *The New York Times* theatre critic Ben Brantley described Bloom's performance as \"a first-rate Broadway debut\" in the title role: \"For once, we have a Romeo who evolves substantively, from a posturing youth in love with love, to a man who discovers the startling revelation of real love, with a last-act descent into bilious, bitter anger that verges on madness.\"[34]\n\n\nIn October 2011, Bloom stated that he would like to return for a fifth *Pirates of the Caribbean* film. Bloom did reprise his character, Will Turner, in a supporting role in the fifth film, *Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales*, which was released in May 2017.[35]\n\n\nBloom starred in the Trafalgar Studios production of *Killer Joe* in 2018. Bloom is currently starring in the Amazon Prime TV show *Carnival Row*, which was filming its second season in Prague before temporarily postponing production due to COVID-19. Together with a number of his *Lord of the Rings* co-stars (plus writer Philippa Boyens and director Peter Jackson), on 1 June 2020 he joined Josh Gad's YouTube series *Reunited Apart* which reunites the cast of popular movies through video-conferencing, and promotes donations to non-profit charities.[36]\n\n\nIn July 2020, Bloom starred in the war film *The Outpost* in which he portrayed the character of captain Benjamin Keating. In 2023, he played Danny Moore, a Nissan marketing executive in the sports film *Gran Turismo* based on the true story of Jann Mardenborough.\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bloom at the 2015 British Fashion Awards\nBloom has said that he tries \"not to exclude himself from real life as much as possible.\"[13] During filming in Morocco for *Kingdom of Heaven*, Bloom rescued and adopted a dog, Sidi (a black Saluki mix with a white mark on his chest).[37][38]\n\n\nIn 2004, he became a full member of SGI-UK (the UK branch of Soka Gakkai International), a lay Buddhist association affiliated with the teachings of Nichiren.[39][40]\n\n\nBloom has also been a part of Global Green, an environmental company, since the early 2000s.[24] As part of his environmental involvement, he has renovated his London home to use solar panels, incorporate recycled materials, and has used energy efficient lightbulbs.[13][24] Bloom has been approached by UNICEF to act as an international ambassador.[24]\n\n\nInvolved in modelling work, in 2002 he starred opposite English actress Kate Beckinsale in a Gap television advertisement directed by Cameron Crowe.[41]\n\n\nBloom has a tattoo of the Elvish word \"nine\" on his right wrist, written in fictional Tengwar Elvish script, a reference to his involvement in *The Lord of the Rings* as one of the nine members of the Fellowship of the Ring. The other actors of \"The Fellowship\" (Sean Astin, Sean Bean, Billy Boyd, Ian McKellen, Dominic Monaghan, Viggo Mortensen, and Elijah Wood) got the same tattoo with the exception of John Rhys-Davies whose stunt double got the tattoo instead.[42][43][44][45] Bloom also has a tattoo of a sun on his lower left abdomen, which he got at age 15 before moving to London.\n\n\nOn 12 February 2009, Bloom actively participated in the 'Australia Unites' fundraiser to raise support for the victims of the Australian bushfires on 7 February 2009.[46]\n\n\n\n![](image)Appointed UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in 2009, Bloom speaking to a schoolboy in Ukraine in 2016\nOn 12 October 2009, Bloom was named a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. He has been involved in the organisation since 2007 and has visited schools and villages in Nepal in support of sanitation and education programmes.[47] Bloom also visited the city of Sloviansk in the east of Ukraine in April 2016 to raise awareness of the education crisis facing children during the Russo-Ukrainian war in 2014–2015.[48] In 2023, Bloom returned to Ukraine again as a Goodwill Ambassador. Bloom met children affected by the war at a children's centre in Kyiv and met Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy.[49]\n\n\nBloom has sustained several injuries: he broke his left arm and cracked his skull three times, broke his nose while playing rugby union, broke his right leg skiing in Switzerland, broke his left leg in a motorbike crash, and broke his right wrist while snowboarding.[22] He also broke his back when he slipped trying to reach a roof terrace of a friend's house and fell three floors.[50] He also broke some ribs while shooting *The Lord of the Rings*.[51]\n\n\nOn 13 July 2009, four hooded teenagers broke into the Hollywood Hills home of Bloom and stole nearly half a million dollars' worth of possessions. The burglars, dubbed the \"Bling Ring,\" targeted the homes of celebrities. Most of Bloom's stolen items were retrieved.[52]\n\n\n\n### Relationships[edit]\n\n\nBloom had an \"on-and-off relationship\"[53] with American actress Kate Bosworth, from 2003 until ending the relationship in September 2006.[54][55]\n\n\nIn late 2007, Bloom began dating Australian supermodel Miranda Kerr.[56] They announced their engagement in June 2010,[57] and were married the following month.[58] Kerr gave birth to their son on 6 January 2011 in Los Angeles.[59][60] On 25 October 2013, Bloom and Kerr announced that they had separated several months earlier, and intended to end their marriage. They were divorced by the end of 2013.[61][62][63]\n\n\nIn 2014, Bloom was in a relationship with French actress Nora Arnezeder.[64]\n\n\nBloom began dating American singer and songwriter Katy Perry in January 2016;[65] however, the couple confirmed in February 2017 that they had split. They resumed their relationship in February 2018,[66][67][68] and became engaged on 14 February 2019.[69][70] On 5 March 2020, it was revealed through the music video for Perry's song \"Never Worn White\" that the couple were expecting their first child together.[71] Perry gave birth to their daughter on 26 August 2020.[72][73][74]\n\n\n\n## Achievements[edit]\n\n\nBloom appeared in his home city of Canterbury on 13 July 2010 when he was presented with an honorary degree from the University of Kent at Canterbury Cathedral.[75] For contributions to the film industry, Bloom was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame on 2 April 2014.[76][77] His motion pictures walk of fame star is located at 6927 Hollywood Boulevard.[78]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1997\n | *Wilde* | Rentboy\n |  |\n| 2001\n | *Black Hawk Down* | PFC Todd Blackburn\n |  |\n| *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring* | Legolas |  |\n| 2002\n | *The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers* | Legolas\n |  |\n| 2003\n | *Ned Kelly* | Joseph Byrne |  |\n| *Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl* | Will Turner |  |\n| *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* | Legolas\n |  |\n| 2004\n | *The Calcium Kid* | Jimmy \"The Calcium Kid\" Connelly\n |  |\n| *Troy* | Paris |  |\n| *Haven* | Shy\n | Also co-producer\n |\n| 2005\n | *Kingdom of Heaven* | Balian de Ibelin |  |\n| *Elizabethtown* | Drew Baylor\n |  |\n| 2006\n | *Love and Other Disasters* | Hollywood Paolo\n | Cameo\n |\n| *The Armenian Genocide* | Auguste Berneau\n | Documentary\n |\n| *Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest* | Will Turner\n |  |\n| 2007\n | *Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End* | Will Turner\n |  |\n| *Everest: A Climb for Peace* | Narrator\n | Documentary\n |\n| 2009\n | *New York, I Love You* | David Cooler\n | Segment: \"Shunji Iwai\"\n |\n| 2010\n | *Sympathy for Delicious* | The Stain\n |  |\n| *Main Street* | Harris Parker\n |  |\n| 2011\n | *The Good Doctor* | Dr. Martin E.

His other film roles include Francisco Scaramanga in the James Bond film *The Man with the Golden Gun* (1974), Count Dooku in several *Star Wars* films (2002–2008), and Saruman in both the *Lord of the Rings* film trilogy (2001–2003) and the *Hobbit* film trilogy (2012–2014).\n\n\nLee was knighted for services to drama and charity in 2009, received the BAFTA Fellowship in 2011, and received the BFI Fellowship in 2013. He credited three films for making his name as an actor, *A Tale of Two Cities* (1958), in which he played the villainous marquis, and two horror films, *The Curse of Frankenstein* (1957), and *Dracula* (1958). He considered his best performance to be that of Pakistan's founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah in the biopic *Jinnah* (1998), and his best film to be the British cult film *The Wicker Man* (1973). He frequently appeared opposite his friend Peter Cushing in horror films, and late in his career had roles in five Tim Burton films.\n\n\nPrior to his acting career, Lee served in the Royal Air Force as an intelligence officer, attached to the No. 260 Squadron RAF as a liaison officer for the Special Operations Executive. Following his World War II service he retired from the RAF in 1946 with the rank of flight lieutenant.\n\n\nKnown as an actor with a deep, strong voice, Lee also sang, recorded opera and musical pieces between 1986 and 1998, and the symphonic metal album *Charlemagne: By the Sword and the Cross* in 2010, after having worked with several metal bands since 2005. The heavy metal follow-up *Charlemagne: The Omens of Death* was released in 2013 on Lee's 91st birthday. He was honoured with the \"Spirit of Hammer\" award at the 2010 Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards ceremony.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nLee was born on 27 May 1922 in Belgravia, London,[2] the son of Lieutenant Colonel Geoffrey Trollope Lee (1879–1941) of the 60th King's Royal Rifle Corps, and his wife, Countess Estelle Marie (*née* Carandini di Sarzano; 1889–1981).[3][4] Lee's father fought in the Boer War and First World War,[5] and his mother was an Edwardian beauty who was painted by Sir John Lavery, Oswald Birley, and Olive Snell, and sculpted by Clare Sheridan.[6][7] Lee's maternal great-grandfather, Jerome Carandini, the Marquis of Sarzano, was an Italian political refugee; his wife, Lee's great-grandmother, was English-born opera singer Marie Carandini (*née* Burgess). He had an elder sister, Xandra Carandini Lee (1917–2002).[8]\n\n\nLee's parents separated when he was four and divorced two years later.[9] During this time, his mother took his sister and him to Wengen in Switzerland.[10] After enrolling in Miss Fisher's Academy in Territet, he played his first role, as Rumpelstiltskin.[11] They then returned to London, where Lee attended Wagner's private school in Queen's Gate, and his mother married Harcourt George St-Croix Rose, a banker and uncle of Ian Fleming.[12] Fleming, author of the James Bond novels, thus became Lee's step-cousin. The family moved to Fulham, living next door to the actor Eric Maturin.[13] One night, he was introduced to Prince Yusupov and Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich, the assassins of Grigori Rasputin, whom Lee was to play many years later.[14]\n\n\nWhen Lee was nine, he was sent to Summer Fields School, a preparatory school in Oxford, some of whose pupils later attended Eton.[15] He continued acting in school plays, though \"the laurels deservedly went to Patrick Macnee.\"[16] Lee applied for a scholarship to Eton, where his interview was in the presence of the ghost story author M.R. James.[17] His poor maths skills meant that he was placed eleventh, and thus missed out on being a King's Scholar by one place. His step-father was not prepared to pay the higher fees that being an Oppidan Scholar meant,[17] so instead he attended Wellington College, where he won scholarships in the classics, studying Ancient Greek and Latin.[18] Aside from a \"tiny part\" in a school play, he did not act while at Wellington.[19] He was a \"passable\" racquets player and fencer and a competent cricketer but did not do well at the other sports played: hockey, football, rugby and boxing.[20] He disliked the parades and weapons training and would always \"play dead\" as soon as possible during mock battles.[21] Lee was frequently beaten at school, including once at Wellington for \"being beaten too often,\" though he accepted them as \"logical and therefore acceptable\" punishments for knowingly breaking the rules.[22] At age 17, and with one year left at Wellington, the summer term of 1939 was his last.[4] His step-father had gone bankrupt, owing £25,000 (equivalent to US$1,957,809 in 2023).[23]\n\n\nHis mother separated from Rose, and Lee had to get a job, his sister already working as a secretary for the Church of England Pensions Board.[24] With most employers on or preparing to go on summer holidays, there were no immediate opportunities for Lee, who was sent to the French Riviera, where his sister was on holiday with friends.[24] On his way there he stopped briefly in Paris, where he stayed with the journalist Webb Miller, a friend of Rose, and witnessed Eugen Weidmann's execution by guillotine – the last public execution performed in France.[25] Arriving in Menton, he stayed with the Russian Mazirov family, living among exiled princely families.[26] It was arranged that he should remain in Menton after his sister had returned home, but with Europe on the brink of war, he returned to London instead.[27] He worked as an office clerk for United States Lines, taking care of the mail and running errands.[28][29]\n\n\n\n## Military service[edit]\n\n\nWhen the Second World War broke out in 1939, Lee had enrolled in a military academy and volunteered to fight for the Finnish Army against the Soviet Union during the Winter War.[30] He and other British volunteers were kept away from the actual fighting, but they were issued with winter gear and were posted on guard duty a safe distance from the border. After two weeks in Finland, they returned home.[31][32] In a later interview, Lee stated that he knew how to shoot but not how to ski and that he probably would not be alive if he had been allowed to go to the front line.[31][33][34] Lee returned to work at United States Lines and found his work more satisfying, feeling that he was contributing. In early 1940, he joined Beecham's, at first as an office clerk, then as a switchboard operator.[35] When Beecham's moved out of London, he joined the Home Guard.[36] In the winter, his father fell ill with bilateral pneumonia and died on 12 March 1941. Realising that he had no inclination to follow his father into the Army, Lee decided to join up while he still had some choice of service, and volunteered for the Royal Air Force.[37]\n\n\nLee reported to RAF Uxbridge for training and was then posted to the Initial Training Wing at Paignton.[38] After he had passed his exams in Liverpool, the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan meant that he travelled on the *Reina del Pacifico* to South Africa, then to his posting at Hillside, at Bulawayo in Southern Rhodesia.[39] Training with de Havilland Tiger Moths, Lee was having his penultimate training session before his first solo flight, when he suffered from headaches and blurred vision. The medical officer hesitantly diagnosed a failure of his optic nerve, and he was told he would never be allowed to fly again.[40] Lee was devastated, and the death of a fellow trainee from his former school, Summer Fields, only made him more despondent. His appeals were fruitless, and he was left with nothing to do.[41] He was moved around to different flying stations before being posted to Southern Rhodesia's capital, Salisbury, in December 1941.[42] He then visited the Mazowe Dam, Marandellas, the Wankie Game Reserve and the ruins of Great Zimbabwe. Thinking he should \"do something constructive for my keep\", he applied to join RAF Intelligence. His superiors praised his initiative, and he was seconded into the British South Africa Police and was posted as a warder at Salisbury Prison.[43] He was then promoted to leading aircraftman. Leaving South Africa, he sailed from Durban to Suez on the *Nieuw Amsterdam*.[44]\n\n\nAfter \"killing time\" at RAF Kasfareet near the Great Bitter Lake in the Suez Canal Zone in 1942, he resumed intelligence work in the city of Ismaïlia.[45] He was then attached to No. 205 Group RAF before being commissioned at the end of January 1943,[46] and attached to No. 260 Squadron RAF as an intelligence officer.[47] As the North African Campaign progressed, the squadron \"leapfrogged\" between Egyptian airstrips, from RAF El Daba to Maaten Bagush and on to Mersa Matruh; they lent air support to the ground forces and bombed strategic targets. Lee, \"broadly speaking, was expected to know everything.\"[48] The Allied advance continued into Libya, through Tobruk and Benghazi to the Marble Arch and then through El Agheila, Khoms and Tripoli, with the squadron averaging five missions a day.[49] As the advance continued into Tunisia, with the Axis forces digging themselves in at the Mareth Line, Lee was almost killed when the squadron's airfield was bombed.[50] After breaking through the Mareth Line, the squadron made their final base in Kairouan;[51] following the Axis surrender in North Africa in May 1943, the squadron moved to Zuwarah in Libya in preparation for the Allied invasion of Sicily.[52] They then moved to Malta, and, after its capture by the British Eighth Army, the Sicilian town of Pachino, before making a permanent base in Agnone Bagni.[53] At the end of July 1943, Lee received his second promotion of the year, this time to flying officer.[54] After the Sicilian campaign was over, Lee came down with malaria for the sixth time in under a year, and was flown to a hospital in Carthage for treatment. When he returned, the squadron was restless, frustrated with a lack of news about the Eastern Front and the Soviet Union in general, and with no mail from home or alcohol. Unrest spread and threatened to turn into mutiny. Lee, by now an expert on Russia, talked them into resuming their duties, which much impressed his commanding officer.[55]\n\n\nAfter the Allied invasion of Italy, the squadron was based in Foggia and Termoli during the winter of 1943, where Lee was then seconded to the Army during an officers' swap scheme.[56] During most of the Battle of Monte Cassino he was attached to the Gurkhas of the 8th Indian Infantry Division.[57] While spending some time on leave in Naples, Lee climbed Mount Vesuvius, which erupted three days later.[58] During the final assault on Monte Cassino, the squadron was based in San Angelo, and Lee was nearly killed when one of the planes crashed on takeoff, and he tripped over one of its live bombs.[59] After the battle, the squadron moved to airfields just outside Rome, and Lee visited the city, where he met his mother's cousin, Nicolò Carandini, who had fought in the Italian resistance movement.[60] In November 1944, Lee was promoted to flight lieutenant and left the squadron in Iesi to take up a posting at Air Force HQ.[61] Lee took part in forward planning and liaison, in preparation for a potential assault into the rumoured German Alpine Fortress.[62] After the war ended, Lee was invited to go hunting near Vienna and was then billeted in Pörtschach am Wörthersee.[63] For the final few months of his service, Lee, who spoke fluent French, Italian and German, among other languages, was seconded to the Central Registry of War Criminals and Security Suspects.[64] Here, he was tasked with helping to track down Nazi war criminals.[65] Of his time with the organisation, Lee said: \"We were given dossiers of what they'd done and told to find them, interrogate them as much as we could and hand them over to the appropriate authority ...\".[65] He retired from the RAF in 1946 with the rank of flight lieutenant.[64]\n\n\nLee mentioned that during the war he was attached to special forces, but declined to give details.[66][67] Lee's stepfather served as a captain in the Intelligence Corps, but it is unlikely he had any influence over Lee's military career. Lee saw his stepfather for the last time on a bus in London in 1940, after he was divorced from Lee's mother, and Lee did not speak to him.[68]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 1947–1957: Career beginnings[edit]\n\n\nReturning to London in 1946, Lee was offered his old job back at Beecham's, with a significant raise, but he turned them down as \"I couldn't think myself back into the office frame of mind.\" The Armed Forces were sending veterans with an education in the Classics to teach at universities, but Lee felt his Latin was too rusty and didn't care for the strict curfews.[69] During lunch with his cousin Nicolò Carandini, now the Italian Ambassador to Britain, Lee was detailing his war wounds when Carandini said, \"Why don't you become an actor, Christopher?\"[70] Lee liked the idea, and after assuaging his mother's protests by pointing to the successful Carandini performers in Australia (which included his great-grandmother Marie Carandini, who had been a successful opera singer), he met Nicolò's friend Filippo Del Giudice, a lawyer-turned-film producer and head of Two Cities Films, part of the Rank Organisation. Lee recalled that Giudice \"looked me up and down... [and] concluded that I was just what the industry had been looking for.\" He was sent to see Josef Somlo for a contract:[71]\n\n\n\n\n> Initially, I was told [by Somlo] I was too tall to be an actor. That's a quite fatuous remark to make. It's like saying you're too short to play the piano. I thought, \"Right, I'll show you...\" At the beginning I didn't know anything about the technique of working in front of a camera, but during those 10 years, I did the one thing that's so vitally important today – I watched, I listened and I learned. So when the time came I was ready... Oddly enough, to play a character who said nothing [The Creature in *The Curse of Frankenstein*].[72]\n> \n> \n\n\nSomlo sent him to see Rank's David Henley and Olive Dodds, who signed him on a seven-year contract.[71] Like other students at Rank's \"Charm School,\" Lee had difficulty finding work.[73] He finally made his film début in 1947, in Terence Young's Gothic romance *Corridor of Mirrors*.[74] He played Charles; the director got around his height by placing him at a table in a nightclub alongside Lois Maxwell, Mavis Villiers, Hugh Latimer and John Penrose. Lee had a single line, \"a satirical shaft meant to qualify the lead's bravura.\"[73]\n\n\nIn this early period, he made an uncredited appearance in Laurence Olivier's film version of *Hamlet* (1948), as a spear carrier (his later co-star and close friend Peter Cushing played Osric). A few years later, he appeared in *Captain Horatio Hornblower R.N.* (1951) as a Spanish captain. He was cast when the director asked him if he could speak Spanish and fence, which he was able to do.[75] Lee appeared uncredited in the American epic *Quo Vadis* (1951), which was shot in Rome, playing a chariot driver and was injured when he was thrown from it at one point during the shoot.[72]\n\n\nHe recalled that his breakthrough came in 1952, when Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. began making films at the British National Studios. He said in 2006, \"I was cast in various roles in 16 of them and even appeared with Buster Keaton and it proved an excellent training ground.\"[75] The same year, he appeared in John Huston's Oscar-nominated *Moulin Rouge*.[74] Throughout the next decade, he made nearly 30 films, including *The Cockleshell Heroes*, playing mostly stock action characters.[76]\n\n\n\n### 1957–1976: Work with Hammer[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lee as the title character in *Dracula* (1958). Lee fixed the image of the fanged vampire in popular culture.[77]\nLee's first film for Hammer was *The Curse of Frankenstein* (1957), in which he played Frankenstein's monster, with Peter Cushing as Baron Victor Frankenstein.[74] It was the first film to co-star Lee and Cushing, who ultimately appeared together in over twenty films and became close friends.[72][76] When he arrived at a casting session for the film, \"they asked me if I wanted the part, I said yes and that was that.\"[75] A little later, Lee co-starred with Boris Karloff in the film *Corridors of Blood* (1958). Lee had previously appeared with Karloff in 1955 in the \"At Night, All Cats are Grey\" episode of the British television series *Colonel March of Scotland Yard*.[78] Karloff and Lee were London neighbours for a time in the mid-1960s.[79]\n\n\n\n> \n> Lee's Dracula is a force of nature: red-eyed, blood dripping from fangs, often in the grip of rage. He's hypnotic, physically powerful, well-spoken, but Lee also understood – crucially – that an important layer from Bram Stoker's novel had been missing from Lugosi's performance: sexuality. Lee's Dracula is a rampant sex fiend, using that stare to make buxom ladies everywhere come over a little faint.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n— *Empire* magazine's entry for Lee's portrayal of Dracula as the 7th Greatest Horror Movie Character of All Time.[80]\n\nLee's own appearance as Frankenstein's monster led to his first appearance as the Transylvanian vampire Count Dracula in the film *Dracula* (1958, known as *Horror of Dracula* in the US).[74] The film saw Lee's \"triumphant debut\" fix the image of the fanged vampire in popular culture, according to writer Kevin Jackson.[81] *Dracula* has been ranked among the best British films.[82] Lee introduced a dark, brooding sexuality to the character, with Tim Stanley stating, \"Lee's sensuality was subversive in that it hinted that women might quite like having their neck chewed on by a stud.\"[83] The film magazine *Empire* ranked Lee's portrayal as Dracula the 7th Greatest Horror Movie Character of All Time.[80] CNN listed the performance third in their top 10 British villains, noting his \"chilling, sonorous tone.\"[84] Lee accepted a similar role in an Italian-French horror picture called *Uncle Was a Vampire* (1959). The same year he starred as Kharis in the Hammer Horror film *The Mummy*.[85]\n\n\n\n![](image)Lee as Kharis in *The Mummy* (1959)\nLee returned to the role of Dracula in Hammer's *Dracula: Prince of Darkness* (1965).[74] Lee's role has no lines, he merely hisses his way through the film. Stories vary as to the reason for this: Lee states he refused to speak the poor dialogue he was given, but screenwriter Jimmy Sangster claims that the script did not contain any lines for the character. This film set the standard for most of the Dracula sequels in the sense that half the film's running time was spent on telling the story of Dracula's resurrection and the character's appearances were brief. Lee went on record to state that he was virtually \"blackmailed\" by Hammer into starring in the subsequent films; unable or unwilling to pay him his going rate, they would resort to reminding him of how many people he would put out of work if he did not take part:[86]\n\n\n\n\n> The process went like this: The telephone would ring and my agent would say, \"Jimmy Carreras [President of Hammer Films] has been on the phone, they've got another Dracula for you.\" And I would say, \"Forget it! I don't want to do another one.\" I'd get a call from Jimmy Carreras, in a state of hysteria. \"What's all this about?!\" \"Jim, I don't want to do it, and I don't have to do it.\" \"No, you have to do it!\" And I said, \"Why?\" He replied, \"Because I've already sold it to the American distributor with you playing the part. Think of all the people you know so well, that you will put out of work!\" Emotional blackmail. That's the only reason I did them.[86]\n> \n> \n\n\nHis roles in the films *Dracula Has Risen from the Grave* (1968), *Taste the Blood of Dracula* (1969), and *Scars of Dracula* (1970) all gave the Count very little to do. Lee said in an interview in 2005, \"all they do is write a story and try and fit the character in somewhere, which is very clear when you see the films. They gave me nothing to do! I pleaded with Hammer to let me use some of the lines that Bram Stoker had written. Occasionally, I sneaked one in.\"[72] He starred in two further Dracula films for Hammer in the early 1970s, both of which attempted to bring the character into the modern-day era. These were not commercially successful: *Dracula A.D. 1972* (1972) and *The Satanic Rites of Dracula* (1973). The latter film was tentatively titled *Dracula Is Dead... and Well and Living in London*, a parody of the stage and film musical revue *Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris*, but Lee was not amused. Speaking at a press conference in 1973 to announce the film, Lee said, \"I'm doing it under protest. I think it is fatuous. I can think of twenty adjectives – fatuous, pointless, absurd. It's not a comedy, but it's got a comic title. I don't see the point.\"[87] *The Satanic Rites of Dracula* was the last Dracula film in which Lee played the Dracula role, as he felt he had played the part too many times and that the films had deteriorated in quality.[88]\n\n\nIn all, Lee played Dracula ten times: seven films for Hammer Productions, once for Jesús Franco's *Count Dracula* (1970), uncredited in Jerry Lewis's *One More Time* (1970) and Édouard Molinaro's *Dracula and Son* (1976). Lee portrayed Rasputin in *Rasputin, the Mad Monk* (1966) and Sir Henry Baskerville (to Cushing's Sherlock Holmes) in *The Hound of the Baskervilles* (1959). Lee later played Holmes himself in 1962's *Sherlock Holmes and the Deadly Necklace*, and returned to Holmes films with Billy Wilder's British-made *The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes* (1970), in which he plays Sherlock's smarter brother, Mycroft. Lee considers this film to be the reason he stopped being typecast: \"I've never been typecast since. Sure, I've played plenty of heavies, but as Anthony Hopkins says, \"I don't play villains, I play people.\"\"[72] Lee played a leading role in the German film *The Puzzle of the Red Orchid* (1962), speaking German, which he had learned during his education in Switzerland. He auditioned for a part in the film *The Longest Day* (1962), but was turned down because he did not \"look like a military man.\" Some film books incorrectly credit him with a role in the film, something he had to correct for the rest of his life.[89]\n\n\nLee's friend the author Dennis Wheatley was responsible for bringing the occult to him.[90] The company made two films from Wheatley's novels, both starring Lee. *The New York Times* described Lee's performance in the first, *The Devil Rides Out* (1967), as \"suave dignity\".[91] However, the second film, *To the Devil a Daughter* (1976), was troubled by production difficulties and was disowned by its author. Although financially successful, it was Hammer's last horror film. Critic Leonard Maltin described it as \"well-made but lacking punch\".[92]\n\n\n\n### Other roles: *The Wicker Man* and *James Bond*[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lee and his close friend Peter Cushing in *Horror Express* (1972). They starred in twenty-two films together.[93]\nLike Cushing, Lee also appeared in horror films for other companies from 1957 to 1977. These included the Dr. Fu Manchu series of films made between 1965 and 1969 (beginning with *The Face of Fu Manchu*) in which he starred as the villain in yellowface make-up; *I, Monster* (1971), an adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's 1886 novella *Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde*, with the main characters' names changed to Dr. Charles Marlowe and Mr. Edward Blake; *The Creeping Flesh* (1972); and his personal favourite, which he considered his best film, *The Wicker Man* (1973), in which he played Lord Summerisle.[94][72] Lee wanted to break free of his image as Dracula and take on more interesting acting roles. He met with screenwriter Anthony Shaffer, and they agreed to work together. Film director Robin Hardy and British Lion head Peter Snell became involved in the project. Shaffer had a series of conversations with Hardy, and the two decided that it would be fun to make a horror film centring on \"old religion,\" in sharp contrast to the popular Hammer films of the day.[95] Shaffer read the David Pinner novel *Ritual*, in which a devout Christian policeman is called to investigate what appears to be the ritual murder of a young girl in a rural village, and decided that it would serve well as the source material for the project. Shaffer and Lee paid Pinner £15,000 (equivalent to US$267,804 in 2023) for the rights to the novel, and Schaffer set to work on the screenplay. However, he soon decided that a direct adaptation would not work well, and began to craft a new story, using only the novel's basic outline.[95][96] Lee was so keen to get the film made, and the budget was so small, that he gave his services for free.[97] He later called the film the best he had ever made.[72]\n\n\nLee appeared as the on-screen narrator in Jess Franco's *Eugenie* (1970) as a favour to producer Harry Alan Towers, unaware that it was softcore pornography, as the sex scenes were shot separately.\n\n\n\n\n> I had no idea that was what it was when I agreed to the role. I was told it was about the Marquis de Sade. I flew out to Spain for one day's work playing the part of a narrator. I had to wear a crimson dinner jacket. There were lots of people behind me. They all had their clothes on. There didn't seem to be anything peculiar or strange. A friend said: 'Do you know you are in a film in Old Compton Street?' In those days that was where the mackintosh brigade watched their films. 'Very funny,' I said. So I crept along there heavily disguised in dark glasses and scarf, and found the cinema and there was my name. I was furious! There was a huge row. When I had left Spain that day everyone behind me had taken their clothes off![67]\n> \n> \n\n\n![](image)Breaking free from the Dracula image:[95] Lee as Lord Summerisle in *The Wicker Man* (1973)\nIn addition to making films in the United Kingdom, Lee made films in mainland Europe: he appeared in two German films, *Count Dracula* (1970), where he again played the vampire count, and *The Torture Chamber of Dr. Sadism* (1967). Other films in Europe he made include *Castle of the Living Dead* (1964) and *Horror Express* (1972). Lee was a producer of the horror film *Nothing But the Night* (1972), in which he starred. It was the first and last film he produced, as he did not enjoy the process.[89]\n\n\nLee appeared as the Comte de Rochefort in Richard Lester's *The Three Musketeers* (1973). He injured his left knee during filming, something he still felt many years later.[72] After the mid-1970s, Lee eschewed horror roles almost entirely. Ian Fleming, author of the James Bond spy novels and Lee's step-cousin, had offered him the role of the titular antagonist in the first Eon-produced Bond film *Dr. No* (1962). Lee enthusiastically accepted, but by the time Fleming told the producers, they had already chosen Joseph Wiseman for the role.[72] Lee finally got to play a James Bond villain in *The Man with the Golden Gun* (1974), in which he was cast as the assassin Francisco Scaramanga. Lee said of his performance, \"In Fleming's novel he's just a West Indian thug, but in the film he's charming, elegant, amusing, lethal... I played him like the dark side of Bond.\"[72]\n\n\nBecause of his filming schedule in Bangkok, film director Ken Russell was unable to sign Lee to play the Specialist in *Tommy* (1975). That role was eventually given to Jack Nicholson. In an AMC documentary on *Halloween* (1978), John Carpenter states that he offered the role of Samuel Loomis to Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, before Donald Pleasence took the role. Years later, Lee told Carpenter that the biggest regret of his career was not taking the role of Dr. Loomis.[98]\n\n\n\n### 1977: Move to Hollywood[edit]\n\n\nIn 1977, Lee left the UK for the US, concerned at being typecast in horror films, as had happened to his close friends Peter Cushing and Vincent Price.[67] His first American appearance was in the disaster film *Airport '77* (1977). In 1978, Lee surprised many people with his willingness to go along with a joke, appearing as guest host on NBC's *Saturday Night Live*.[72] Steven Spielberg, who was in the audience for that show, cast him in *1941* (1979).[72] Meanwhile, Lee co-starred with Bette Davis in the Disney film *Return from Witch Mountain* (1978).[99] He turned down the role of Dr. Barry Rumack (finally played by Leslie Nielsen) in the disaster spoof *Airplane!* (1980), a decision he later called \"a big mistake.\"[72]\n\n\nLee played the mad scientist Dr. Catheter in *Gremlins 2: The New Batch* (1990). In a nod to his role as Dracula in Hammer Films, as the Bat Gremlin transforms, Dr. Catheter experiences deja-vu – the audience hears Dracula music.[100] Lee made his last appearances as Sherlock Holmes in the television films *Incident at Victoria Falls* (1991) and *Sherlock Holmes and the Leading Lady* (1992).[101]\n\n\nLee and Peter Cushing appeared together in more than a dozen feature films together for Hammer Films, Amicus Productions, and other companies, as well as in *Hamlet* (1948) and *Moulin Rouge* (1952), albeit in separate scenes. They featured, too, in separate instalments of the *Star Wars* films: Cushing as Grand Moff Tarkin in the original film, and Lee decades later as Count Dooku. The last project which united them in person was a documentary, *Flesh and Blood: The Hammer Heritage of Horror* (1994), which they jointly narrated, two months before Cushing's death.[102]\n\n\nLee considered his best performance to be in this period, when he played Pakistan's founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah in the biopic *Jinnah* (1998).[72][94]\n\n\n\n### 2000s: *Gormenghast*, *The Lord of the Rings* and the *Star Wars* prequel trilogy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lee at Forbidden Planet, New Oxford Street, London, signing *The Two Towers*\nLee had many television roles. These included the role Flay in the BBC television miniseries *Gormenghast* (2000) based on Mervyn Peake's novels. He also appeared as Lucas de Beaumanoir, the Grand Master of the Knights Templar, in the BBC/A&E co-production of Sir Walter Scott's *Ivanhoe* (1997).[103]\n\n\nLee played Saruman in Peter Jackson's *The Lord of the Rings* film trilogy. In the commentary, he stated that he had for decades dreamt of playing Gandalf. He conceded that he was now too old, and that his physical limitations prevented him from being considered. The role of Saruman, unlike that of Gandalf, required no horse riding and far less fighting. Lee had met J. R. R. Tolkien once, which made him the only person involved in the film trilogy to have done so.[104] He made a habit of reading the novels at least once a year.[105][106][107] In addition, he performed for The Tolkien Ensemble's album *At Dawn in Rivendell* in 2003.[108] Lee's appearance in the final film in the trilogy, *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King*, was cut from the theatrical release, but the scene was reinstated in the extended edition.[109] *The Lord of the Rings* marked the beginning of a major career revival that continued in *Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones* (2002) and *Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith* (2005), in which he played the villainous Count Dooku. He did most of the swordplay himself, though a stunt double was required for the long shots with more vigorous footwork.[72] In 2005 he played Dr. Wonka, father of Willy Wonka, in Tim Burton's film adaptation of the Roald Dahl children's classic *Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.*[110]\n\n\n\n![](image)Lee filming Marcus Warren's *The Heavy* in Westminster, London in 2007\nIn 2007, Lee collaborated with Tim Burton on *Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street*, playing the spirit of Sweeney Todd's victims, called the Gentleman Ghost, alongside Anthony Head, with both singing \"The Ballad of Sweeney Todd,\" its reprises and the Epilogue. These songs were recorded, but eventually cut since Burton felt that the songs were too theatrical for the film. Lee's appearance was completely cut from the film, but Head still had an uncredited one-line cameo.[111]\n\n\nIn late November 2009, Lee narrated the Science Fiction Festival in Trieste, Italy.[112] Also in 2009, Lee starred in Stephen Poliakoff's British period drama *Glorious 39*, Academy Award-nominated director Danis Tanović's war film *Triage*, and Duncan Ward's comedy *Boogie Woogie*.[113]\n\n\n\n### 2010s: Later roles[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lee at the Berlin International Film Festival in February 2012\nIn 2004, Lee lamented that Hollywood scripts were mainly spin-offs, as people were afraid of taking financial risks, commenting that he was mostly being offered spin-offs of *Lord of the Rings* or *Star Wars*.[94] In 2010, he marked his fourth collaboration with Tim Burton by voicing the Jabberwock in Burton's adaptation of Lewis Carroll's classic book *Alice in Wonderland*, alongside Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter and Anne Hathaway.[76][114] Lee respected Depp as \"a fellow survivor\",[115] describing him as \"inventive and [having] enormous versatility\".[115]\n\n\nIn 2010, Lee received the Steiger Award (Germany) and,[116] in February 2011, Lee was awarded the BAFTA Fellowship.[117]\n\n\nIn 2011, he appeared in a Hammer film, *The Resident*, for the first time in 35 years. The film was directed by Antti Jokinen, and Lee gave a \"superbly sinister\" performance alongside Hilary Swank and Jeffrey Dean Morgan.[118][119] While filming scenes for the film in New Mexico in early 2009, Lee injured his back when he tripped over power cables on set.[65] Lee appears as the unnamed \"Old Gentleman\" who acts as Lachlan's mentor in a flashback.[120] Also in 2011, Lee appeared in the critically acclaimed *Hugo*, directed by Martin Scorsese.[121]\n\n\n\n![](image)Lee played the evil wizard Saruman in Peter Jackson's *The Lord of the Rings* and *The Hobbit* film trilogies. The role has been described as \"one of the most powerful villains in cinema history\", relying on Lee's \"physical appearance\", in contrast to the Dark Lord Sauron.[122]\n> \n> Christopher is truly a force to be reckoned with. Doing a scene with him and having him peering down at you, screaming into your face, all you can think of is 'My God, that's Dracula!'\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nJohnny Depp who worked with Lee in five Tim Burton films, from *Sleepy Hollow* in 1999 to *Dark Shadows* in 2012.[123]\n\nLee reprised the role of Saruman for the prequel film *The Hobbit*.[124] He said he would have liked to have shown Saruman's corruption by Sauron,[125] but was too old to travel to New Zealand, so the production was adjusted to allow him to participate from London.[126]\n\n\nIn 2012, Lee marked his fifth and final collaboration with Tim Burton, by appearing in Burton's film adaptation of the gothic soap opera *Dark Shadows*, in the small role of a New England fishing captain.[127][128]\n\n\nIn an interview in August 2013, Lee said that he was \"saddened\" to hear his friend Johnny Depp was considering retiring from acting, observing that he himself had no intention of doing that:\n\n\n\n\n> There are frustrations – people who lie to you, people who don't know what they are doing, films that don't turn out the way you had wanted them to – so, yes, I do understand [why Depp would consider retiring]. I always ask myself, \"Well, what else could I do?\" Making films has never just been a job to me, it's my life. I have some interests outside of acting – I sing and I've written books, for instance – but acting is what keeps me going, it's what I do, it gives life purpose... I'm realistic about the amount of work I can get at my age, but I take what I can, even voice-overs and narration.[129]\n> \n> \n\n\nLee narrated the feature-length documentary *Necessary Evil: Super-Villains of DC Comics*, which was released on 25 October 2013.[130] In 2014, he appeared in an episode of the BBC documentary series *Timeshift* called *How to Be Sherlock Holmes: The Many Faces of a Master Detective*. Lee and others who had played Sherlock Holmes discussed the character and the various interpretations of him.[131] He appeared in a web exclusive, reading an excerpt from the Sherlock Holmes short story *The Final Problem*.[132]\n\n\nA month before his death, Lee had signed to star with an ensemble cast in the Danish film *The 11th*.[133] One of his final performances was the independent *Angels in Notting Hill* directed by Michael Pakleppa,[134] a fantasy film about an angel trapped in London who falls in love with a human being. Lee played The Boss / Mr. President and the film premiered in the Regent Street Cinema, London on 29 October 2016.[135]\n\n\n\n### Voice work[edit]\n\n\nLee provided voices for numerous films and video games.[114][136] He spoke fluent English, Italian, French, Spanish, and German, and was moderately proficient in Swedish, Russian, and Greek.[137] He was the original voice of Thor in the German dubs of the Danish 1986 animated film *Valhalla*, and of King Haggard in both the English and German dubs of the 1982 animated adaptation of *The Last Unicorn*.[114] He provided all the voices for the English dub of *Monsieur Hulot's Holiday* (1953).[138] He voiced Death in the animated versions of Terry Pratchett's *Soul Music*[114] and *Wyrd Sisters*,[114] and reprised the role in the Sky1 live action adaptation *The Colour of Magic*, taking over from the late Ian Richardson.[114] He provided the voice for the role of Ansem the Wise/DiZ in video games including *Kingdom Hearts II*.[114]\n\n\nLee reprised his role as Saruman in the video game *The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth*.[114] He narrated and sang for the Danish musical group The Tolkien Ensemble's 2003 studio album *At Dawn in Rivendell*, taking the role of Treebeard, King Théoden and others in the readings or singing of their respective poems or songs.[139] In 2007, he voiced the transcript of *The Children of Húrin* by J. R. R. Tolkien for the audiobook version of the novel.[140] In 2005, Lee provided the voice of Pastor Galswells in *The Corpse Bride*, co-directed by Tim Burton and Mike Johnson.[114] He served as the narrator on *The Nightmare Before Christmas* poem, also written by Tim Burton as well. Lee reprised his role as Count Dooku in the animated film *Star Wars: The Clone Wars* (2008).[114] Some thirty years after playing Francisco Scaramanga in *The Man with the Golden Gun*, Lee provided the voice of Scaramanga in the video game *GoldenEye: Rogue Agent*.[114][141] In 2013, Lee voiced The Earl of Earl's Court in the BBC Radio 4 radio play *Neverwhere* by Neil Gaiman.[142] Lee recorded special dialogue, in addition to serving as the Narrator, for the *Lego The Hobbit* video game released in April 2014; at 91 years and 316 days old he appears in the *Guinness Book of Records* as the oldest video game narrator.[143]\n\n\n\n### Music career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lee receiving the \"Spirit of Hammer\" award for his album *Charlemagne: By the Sword and the Cross* at the 2010 Metal Hammer Golden Gods ceremony in London\nWith his operatic[144] bass voice, Lee sang on *The Wicker Man* soundtrack, performing Paul Giovanni's composition, \"The Tinker of Rye.\"[145] He sang the closing credits song of the 1994 horror film *Funny Man*.[146] In 1977, he appeared on Peter Knight and Bob Johnson's (from Steeleye Span) concept album *The King of Elfland's Daughter*.[147]\n\n\nLee's first contact with heavy metal music came by singing a duet with Fabio Lione, lead vocalist of the Italian symphonic power metal band Rhapsody of Fire on the single \"The Magic of the Wizard's Dream\" from their album *Symphony of Enchanted Lands II – The Dark Secret*, although he only performs backing vocals on the album version. Later he appeared as a narrator and backing vocalist on the band's four albums *Symphony of Enchanted Lands II – The Dark Secret*, *Triumph or Agony*, *The Frozen Tears of Angels*, and *From Chaos to Eternity*, as well as on the EP *The Cold Embrace of Fear – A Dark Romantic Symphony*, portraying the Wizard King. He worked with Manowar while they were recording a new version of their first album, *Battle Hymns*. The original voice was Orson Welles's (long dead at the time of the re-recording).[148]\n\n\nWith the song \"Jingle Hell,\" Lee entered the *Billboard* Hot 100 chart at No. 22, thus becoming the second oldest living performer to ever enter the music charts, at 91 years and 6 months.[149][150] After media attention, the song rose to No. 18. as Lee became the oldest person to have a top 20 hit.[151]\n\n\nLee released a third EP of covers in May 2014, called *Metal Knight,* to celebrate his 92nd birthday; in addition to a cover of \"My Way,\" it contains \"The Toreador March,\" inspired by the opera *Carmen*, and the songs \"The Impossible Dream\" and \"I, Don Quixote\" from the Don Quixote musical *Man of La Mancha*. Lee was inspired to record the latter songs because, \"as far as I am concerned, Don Quixote is the most metal fictional character that I know.\"[152] His fourth EP and third annual Christmas release came in December 2014, as he put out \"Darkest Carols, Faithful Sing,\" a playful take on \"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing.\"[153] He explained: \"It's light-hearted, joyful and fun... At my age, the most important thing for me is to keep active by doing things that I truly enjoy. I do not know how long I am going to be around, so every day is a celebration, and I want to share it with my fans.\"[154]\n\n\nOn the self-titled debut album by Hollywood Vampires, a supergroup consisting of Johnny Depp, Alice Cooper and Joe Perry, Lee is featured as a narrator in the track \"The Last Vampire.\" Recorded shortly before his death, this marks Lee's final appearance on a musical record.[155] In 2019, Rhapsody of Fire included a posthumous narration on their new album, *The Eighth Mountain*, in which Lee narrated the concept story of the band's *Nephilim Empire Saga*.[156]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### Family and relationships[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lee with his wife, Birgit Krøncke, March 2009\nThe Carandinis, Lee's maternal ancestors, were given the right to bear the coat of arms of the Holy Roman Empire by the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa.[7][137] In the late 1950s, Lee was engaged to Countess Henriette Ewa Agnes von Rosen, whom he had met at a nightclub in Stockholm.[157] Her father, Count Fritz von Rosen, proved demanding, getting them to delay the wedding for a year, asking his London-based friends to interview Lee, hiring private detectives to investigate him, and asking Lee to provide him with references, which Lee obtained from Douglas Fairbanks Jr., John Boulting, and Joe Jackson.[158] Lee found the meeting of her extended family to be like something from a surrealist Luis Buñuel film, and thought they were \"killing me with cream.\"[159] Finally, Lee had to have the permission of the King of Sweden to marry. Lee had met him some years before while filming *Tales of Hans Anderson*, where he received his blessing.[159] However, shortly before the wedding, Lee ended the engagement. He was concerned that his financial insecurity in his chosen profession meant that she \"deserved better\" than being \"pitched into the dishevelled world of an actor.\" She understood, and they called the wedding off.[160]\n\n\nLee was introduced to Danish painter and former model Birgit \"Gitte\" Krøncke by a Danish friend in 1960.[161] They were engaged soon after, and married on 17 March 1961.[162] They had a daughter, Christina Erika Carandini Lee (b. 1963).[163] Lee was the uncle of the British actress Harriet Walter.[137] Both Lee and his daughter Christina provided spoken vocals on Rhapsody of Fire's album *From Chaos to Eternity*. Lee relocated to Los Angeles in the 1970s after becoming disillusioned with film roles he was being offered in Britain at the time and stated that in Hollywood \"I was no longer a *horror star.* I was an actor.\"[164] He subsequently moved back to England and lived with his family in Cadogan Square in west London until his death.[165]\n\n\n\n### Physical characteristics and beliefs[edit]\n\n\nLee was known for his imposing height:[166] he was 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m) tall.[67] On BBC Radio's *Test Match Special* \"View from the Boundary\" interview with Brian Johnston on 20 June 1987, Lee described himself as 6 ft 4 in tall.[167] Lee and his wife Birgit were listed among the fifty best-dressed over 50s by *The Guardian* in March 2013.[168]\n\n\nLee was an Anglo-Catholic Christian.[169] After the Second World War, he was a server at St Stephen's Church in South Kensington, London, during T. S. Eliot's period as a parishioner there.[170] Politically, Lee supported the Conservative Party. He described Michael Howard as \"the ideal person to lead the party\" in 2003,[171] and also supported Winston Churchill, Harold Macmillan, Alec Douglas-Home, Edward Heath, Margaret Thatcher, John Major, William Hague and David Cameron.[65] He was sympathetic to Islam, stating that Islamic terrorism \"is not the true Islam.\"[172]\n\n\nLee had an interest in the occult, to which he was introduced by Dennis Wheatley.[90] It was once erroneously reported Lee had a library of occult literature that amounted to 20,000 books. However, during a talk at University College Dublin Lee confirmed he did not have such a collection and said “Somebody wrote that I had 20,000 books. I don’t — I’d have to live in a bath!” He furthermore cautioned the audience against involving themselves in occult practices, claiming “I have met people who claim to be Satanists, who claim to be involved with black magic, who claimed that they not only knew a lot about it. But as I said, I certainly have not been involved and I warn all of you: never, never, never. You will not only lose your mind: you lose your soul.”[173][174]\n\n\n\n### Death[edit]\n\n\nLee died at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital on 7 June 2015 after being admitted for respiratory problems and heart failure, shortly after celebrating his 93rd birthday. His wife delayed the public announcement until 11 June, informing his family of the death before releasing the news to the press.[175][176][177]\n\n\nFollowing Lee's death, fans, friends, actors, directors and others involved in the film industry publicly gave their personal tributes.[178][179][180][181] Then-Prime Minister David Cameron praised Lee as a \"titan of the golden age of cinema.\"[177] He was honoured by the academy at the 88th Academy Awards on 28 February 2016 in the annual in Memoriam section.[182]\n\n\n\n## Honours and legacy[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Christopher Lee filmography § Awards and nominations\n\nLee was the subject of the BBC's *This Is Your Life* in 1974, where he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews.[183] In 1994, for his influence on the horror genre, he received the Bram Stoker Award for Lifetime Achievement.[184] In 1997, he was appointed a Commander of the Venerable Order of Saint John.[185] On 16 June 2001, as part of that year's Queen's Birthday Honours, Lee was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire \"for services to Drama.\"[186][187] He was made a Knight Bachelor \"For services to Drama and to Charity\" on 13 June as part of the Queen's Birthday Honours in 2009.[188] The French government made him a Commander of Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 2011.[189]\n\n\nLee was named 2005's 'most marketable star in the world' in a *USA Today* newspaper poll, after three of the films he appeared in grossed US$640 million.[190] In 2010, he was identified as the IMDb member with the greatest closeness centrality, implying he was the best-connected person in the business.[191]\n\n\nIn 2008, Lee in his role as Count Dracula featured on a commemorative UK postage stamp issued by the Royal Mail to mark 50 years since the release of *Dracula* (1958) by Hammer Films.[192] In 2010, Lee received the Spirit of Hammer award at the Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards, for his contribution to the metal genre.[193][194] In 2011, Lee was awarded a BAFTA Fellowship;[195] he received a BFI Fellowship in 2013.[196]\n\n\nIn 2011, accompanied by his wife Birgit, and on the 164th anniversary of the birth of Bram Stoker, Lee was honoured with a tribute by University College Dublin, and described his honorary life membership of the UCD Law Society as \"in some ways as special as the Oscars.\"[197] He was awarded the Bram Stoker Gold Medal by the Trinity College Philosophical Society, of which Stoker had been president, and a copy of *Collected Ghost Stories of MR James* by Trinity College's School of English.[198]\n\n\n\n## Works[edit]\n\n\n### Filmography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Christopher Lee filmography\n\n### Books[edit]\n\n\n* *Christopher Lee's X Certificate*, London: Star Books, 1975.

He is the recipient of six Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts Awards (AACTA) and has also been recognised as an Honorary Officer of the Order of Australia. Born in Colonial Nigeria to English parents, he has resided in Australia for the entirety of his career.\n\n\nWeaving landed his first major role as English cricket captain Douglas Jardine on the Australian television series *Bodyline* (1984). He rose to prominence with his appearances in the Australian films *Proof* (1991) and *The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert* (1994), winning his first AACTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for the former. By the turn of the millennium, Weaving achieved international recognition through roles in mainstream American productions. His most notable film roles include Agent Smith in the first three *The Matrix* films (1999–2003), Elrond in *The Lord of the Rings* (2001–2003) and *The Hobbit* (2012–2014) trilogies, the title character in *V for Vendetta* (2005), and Johann Schmidt / Red Skull in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film *Captain America: The First Avenger* (2011).\n\n\nIn addition to his live action appearances, Weaving has had several voice over roles, including in the films *Babe* (1995), *Happy Feet* (2006) and *Happy Feet Two* (2011), and the *Transformers* series as Megatron (2007–2011).

His family moved back to Australia in 1976, where he attended Knox Grammar School in Sydney.[5] He graduated from Sydney's National Institute of Dramatic Art in 1981.[6]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 1984–1998[edit]\n\n\nWeaving's first television role was in the 1984 Australian television series *Bodyline*, as the English cricket captain Douglas Jardine. Weaving appeared in the Australian miniseries *The Dirtwater Dynasty* in 1988 and as Geoffrey Chambers in the drama *Barlow and Chambers: A Long Way From Home*. He starred opposite Nicole Kidman in the 1989 TV mini-series *Bangkok Hilton*. In 1991, Weaving received the Australian Film Institute's \"Best Actor\" award for his performance in the low-budget *Proof* as the blind photographer. He appeared as Sir John in Yahoo Serious's 1993 comedy *Reckless Kelly*, a lampoon of Australian outlaw Ned Kelly.\n\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Weaving portrayed drag queen Anthony \"Tick\" Belrose/Mitzi Del Bra in the 1994 film *Priscilla, Queen of the Desert*, and provided the voice of Rex the sheepdog in the 1995 family film *Babe* and its 1998 sequel *Babe: Pig in the City*. In 1998, he received the \"Best Actor\" award from the Montreal World Film Festival for his performance as a suspected serial killer in *The Interview*.\n\n\n\n### 1999–2010[edit]\n\n\nWeaving played the enigmatic and evil-minded Agent Smith in the 1999 film *The Matrix*. He later reprised that role in the film's 2003 sequels, *The Matrix Reloaded* and *The Matrix Revolutions*. He was a voice actor in the cartoon film *The Magic Pudding*.[7]\n\n\n\n![](image)Weaving at *The Matrix Revolutions* premiere in 2003\nHe received additional acclaim in the role of half-elven lord Elrond in Peter Jackson's three-film adaptation of *The Lord of the Rings*, released between 2001 and 2003. Weaving was the main actor in Andrew Kotatko's award-winning film *Everything Goes* (2004). He starred as a heroin-addicted ex-rugby league player in the 2005 Australian indie film *Little Fish*, opposite Cate Blanchett. Weaving played the title role as V in the 2005 film *V for Vendetta*, in which he was reunited with the Wachowskis, creators of *The Matrix* trilogy, who wrote the adapted screenplay. Actor James Purefoy was originally signed to play the role, but was fired six weeks into filming over creative differences.[8][9][10] Weaving reshot most of Purefoy's scenes as V (even though his face is never seen) apart from a couple of minor dialogue-free scenes early in the film while stuntman David Leitch performed all of V's stunts.\n\n\nWeaving reprised his role as Elrond for the video game *The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-Earth II*. He regularly appears in productions by the Sydney Theatre Company (STC). In 2006, he worked with Cate Blanchett on a reprise of the STC production of *Hedda Gabler* in New York City. In a controversial move by director Michael Bay, Weaving was chosen as the Decepticon leader Megatron vocally in the 2007 live-action film *Transformers*, rather than using the original version of the character's voice created by the voice actor Frank Welker.\n\n\n\n![](image)Weaving at *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* premiere in 2003\nWeaving himself was unaware of the controversy and had accepted the role based on Michael Bay's personal request; in a November 2008 *Sun Herald* interview, he said he had never seen *Transformers*. Though Weaving reprised his role in two sequels, he does not have much personal investment in the *Transformers* films. In February 2010, Weaving revealed to *The Age*: \"Director Michael Bay talks to me on the phone. I've never met him. We were doing the voice for the second one and I still hadn't seen the first one. I still didn't really know who the characters were and I didn't know what anything was. It's a voice job, for sure, and people assume I've spent my life working on it, but I really know so little about it.\"[11] In 2012, Weaving said to *Collider*: \"It was one of the only things I've ever done where I had no knowledge of it, I didn't care about it, I didn't think about it. They wanted me to do it. In one way, I regret that bit. I don't regret doing it, but I very rarely do something if it's meaningless. It was meaningless to me, honestly. I don't mean that in any nasty way.\"\n\n\nWeaving played a supporting role in Joe Johnston's 2010 remake of the 1941 film *The Wolfman*, starring Benicio del Toro. Immediately after *Wolfman* wrapped in spring 2008, he returned home to Australia to film a lead role in the film *Last Ride*, directed by Glendyn Ivin. In early 2009, Guillermo del Toro, then director of *The Hobbit* films, prequels to *The Lord of the Rings*, confirmed his intent to again cast Weaving as Elrond of Rivendell in a BBC interview.[12] When asked about reprising the role, Weaving replied that he was game, but had not officially been approached. Del Toro eventually left the project; Peter Jackson decided to direct the films himself but Weaving was not officially confirmed in the cast until May 2011.\n\n\nWeaving spent the summer of 2009 starring in the Melbourne Theatre Company's production of *God of Carnage*, portraying the caustic lawyer Alain Reille. He returned to the stage in November 2010 in Sydney Theatre Company's *Uncle Vanya*, co-starring Cate Blanchett and Richard Roxburgh.[13] Weaving filmed a guest role on Roxburgh's Australian TV series *Rake* in May 2010.\n\n\nIn May 2009, Weaving accepted a co-starring role in the docudrama *Oranges and Sunshine*,[14] about the forced migration of thousands of British children to Australia in the 1950s. Filming began in autumn 2009 in Nottingham, England, and Adelaide, South Australia, and continued through January 2010. The film premiered at the Rome International Film Festival on 28 October 2010 and garnered positive reviews. 2010 also saw the release of *Legend of the Guardians* (formerly *The Guardians of Ga'Hoole*), in which Weaving has another high-profile voice role,[15] portraying two different owls named Noctus and Grimble in Zack Snyder's film adaptation of Kathryn Lasky's popular series of children's books.\n\n\nOn 4 May 2010, it was officially confirmed by Marvel Studios that Weaving would play the fictional Nazi Red Skull in the superhero film *Captain America: The First Avenger*.[16] Weaving completed filming his role on the project in September 2010 and returned to Sydney to prepare for *Uncle Vanya*. It is unlikely he will sign on for any further installments in the Marvel Cinematic Universe; in an August 2011 *Baltimore Sun* interview, the actor confided he is weary of typecasting and of \"blockbuster\" films in general: \"I think I've about had enough... I'm not sure how many more of them I'll make. It doesn't feel to me as though they've been the majority of my work, though that's probably the way it seems to most other people.\"[17]\n\n\n\n### 2011–present[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Weaving at Sydney Film Festival in 2013\nOn 13 March 2011, *The Key Man*, which Weaving filmed in 2006, finally debuted at the South By Southwest Festival in Austin, Texas.[18] The child migrant saga *Oranges and Sunshine* opened in the UK on 1 April, the culmination of months of success on the festival circuit in late 2010-early 2011.[19] In March, the Sydney Theatre Company and John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts announced that STC's 2010 production of Chekhov's Uncle Vanya would be reprised in Washington, D.C., during the month of August.[20] In April, months of speculation finally ended when Weaving appeared on *The Hobbit*'s New Zealand set, shortly before a production spokesman officially confirmed the actor's return as Elrond in Peter Jackson's prequel trilogy to *The Lord of the Rings*.[21] He was part of the cast of the Wachowskis' adaptation of David Mitchell's novel *Cloud Atlas*.[22] The project, co-starring Tom Hanks, Ben Whishaw, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, and Susan Sarandon, began filming in September 2011 and was released in October 2012.\n\n\n2012 also found Weaving re-focusing on his theatrical career, with a return to the Sydney Theatre Company to star in a new adaptation of Christopher Hampton's play *Les Liaisons Dangereuses* in March.[23] He portrayed the notorious Vicomte de Valmont, a character he first played onstage in 1987. His frequent stage foil Pamela Rabe costarred. Weaving and Cate Blanchett reprised their roles in STC's internationally lauded production of *Uncle Vanya* for a ten-day run at New York's Lincoln Center in July.[24]\n\n\nThe busy actor also joined the cast of three forthcoming Australian films in summer 2012. The Western-tinged police thriller *Mystery Road*, written and directed by Ivan Sen, began filming in June 2012.[25] Weaving appeared in the prison drama *Healing* for director Craig Monahan, with whom he previously made *The Interview* (1998) and *Peaches* (2005).[26] He appeared in a segment of the Australian anthology film *The Turning*, based on Tim Winton's collection of linked stories, entitled \"The Commission\", directed by David Wenham.[27] He ended 2013 co-starring with Richard Roxburgh and Philip Quast in Samuel Beckett's *Waiting For Godot*, for the Sydney Theatre Company.[28][29]\n\n\nIn the spring of 2013, Weaving reprised the Agent Smith role for a General Electric television commercial for their \"Brilliant Machines\" innovations in healthcare management technology, which was slated to air during a break from 13 April's edition of *Saturday Night Live*, and subsequently continued to receive multiple airings on major cable networks.[30]\n\n\nFrom 26 July to 27 September 2014, Weaving played the titular role of Sydney Theatre Company's production of *Macbeth*.[31] In an unusual treatment of the Shakespearian tragedy by young Sydney director Kip Williams, Weaving's performance was described by Peter Gotting of *The Guardian* as \"the role of his career\".[32]\n\n\nIn October 2015, Weaving joined the cast of the film adaption of Craig Silvey's novel *Jasper Jones*.[33][34]\n\n\nIn 2018, Weaving starred as Thaddeus Valentine in *Mortal Engines*. In the same year, he appeared alongside Benedict Cumberbatch in Patrick Melrose.\n\n\nIn 2020, Weaving starred as Alfred in Tony Kushner's adaptation of *The Visit*.[35]\n\n\nSince 2021, Weaving has starred as Glen Mathieson[36] in the Australian intergenerational drama series *Love Me*.\n\n\n\n## Other roles[edit]\n\n\nIn 2004, Weaving became an ambassador for Australian animal rights organisation Voiceless, the animal protection institute. He attends events, promotes Voiceless in interviews, and assists in their judging of annual grants recipients.[37]\n\n\nAs of 2022[update], Weaving is on the board of the Adelaide Film Festival.[38]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nWhen he was 13 years old, Weaving was diagnosed with epilepsy. Although the condition rarely affected him and stopped in his early 30s, he still chooses not to drive, given the risk of a seizure.[39] He has been in a relationship with Katrina Greenwood since 1984;[40] they live in Sydney and have two children together: Harry Greenwood, an actor, and Holly Greenwood, an artist.[41] Their children were given their mother's surname, which Weaving’s son described as the family's \"stand against the patriarchy.\"[42]\n\n\nWeaving also has a brother and a sister. He is the uncle of actress Samara Weaving, who also began her career in Australia before transitioning to American roles. Both appeared in the 2013 Australian film *Mystery Road*. His younger niece Morgan Weaving appeared on the Australian soap opera *Home and Away* alongside her sister.[43]\n\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\n* 1991 – Australian Film Institute Awards, Best Actor in a Lead Role: *Proof*\n* 1998 – Australian Film Institute Awards, Best Actor in a Lead Role: *The Interview*\n* 2005 – Australian Film Institute Awards, Best Actor in a Lead Role: *Little Fish*\n* 2007 – The Constellation Awards, Best Male Performance in a 2006 Science Fiction Film, TV Movie, or Miniseries: *V for Vendetta*\n* 2011 – Sydney Theatre Award, Best Supporting Actor:Sydney Theatre Company's Uncle Vanya\n* 2012 – Helen Hayes Award, Best Supporting Performer, Non-Resident Production: Sydney Theatre Company's Uncle Vanya\n* 2018 – Helpmann Award for Best Male Actor in a Play, for Arturo Ui in the Sydney Theatre Company's *The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui*[44]\n* 2018 – Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film: *Patrick Melrose*\n* 2020 – Honorary Officer of the Order of Australia[45]\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | It has been suggested that this article should be **split** into multiple articles.

After graduating from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, Bean made his professional debut in a theatre production of *Romeo and Juliet* in 1983. Retaining his Yorkshire accent, he first found mainstream success for his portrayal of Richard Sharpe in the ITV series *Sharpe*, which originally ran from 1993 to 1997.\n\n\nBean's film roles include *Patriot Games* (1992), *GoldenEye* (1995), *Ronin* (1998), *Don't Say a Word* (2001), *The Lord of the Rings* trilogy (2001–2003), *Equilibrium* (2002), *National Treasure* (2004), *Troy* (2004), *Flightplan* (2005), *North Country* (2005), *The Island* (2005), *Silent Hill* (2006), *Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief* (2010), *Black Death* (2010), *Jupiter Ascending* (2015), and *The Martian* (2015).\n\n\nHis television roles include the BBC anthology series *Accused*, *Broken*, *Game of Thrones,* and the ITV historical drama series *Henry VIII* and *Legends*. As a voice actor, Bean has been featured in the video games *The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion*, *Sid Meier's Civilization VI*, and the feature films *Wolfwalkers* and *Mummies* among others. Since 2002, Bean has been the main voice over for O2 adverts, with the most recent advert released in June 2023.\n\n\nIn 2022, Bean won the British Academy Television Award as Leading Actor in *Time*, a BBC One drama.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sheffield Legends plaque in Bean's home city of Sheffield, England\nShaun Mark Bean[3] was born on 17 April 1959 in Handsworth, a suburb of Sheffield, the son of Rita (née Tuckwood) and Brian K. Bean (born 1934).[4][5] He has a younger sister, Lorraine. His paternal grandfather, Harold Bean Jr. (1914–2001), served in the Royal Navy in the Second World War[6] and was a stud mill labourer who later became a pacifist.[5] His father owned a fabrication company that employed 50 people, including Bean's mother, who worked as a secretary. Despite becoming relatively wealthy, the family never moved away from the council estate as they preferred to remain close to friends and family.[7] As a child, Bean smashed a glass door during an argument, which left a piece of glass embedded in his leg that briefly impeded his walking, and left a large scar.[4] This prevented him from pursuing his ambition of playing football professionally.[8]\n\n\nBean first attended a local school, Handsworth Junior School, before going to Athelstan School until he was 12, when he went to study at Brook School.[9] In 1975, Bean left Brook Comprehensive School with O levels in Art and English.[10] After a job at a supermarket and another for the local council, he started work at his father's firm. Once a week, he attended Rotherham College of Arts and Technology to study welding.[11] While at college, he came upon an art class, and decided to pursue his interest in art. After attending courses at two other colleges, one for half a day and the other for less than a week, he returned to Rotherham College, where he enrolled in a drama course. After some college plays and one at Rotherham Civic Theatre, he won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), starting a seven-term course in January 1981.[4]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bean at the premiere of *North Country* at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section of a biography of a living person **needs additional citations for verification**.

As an actor, he adopted the Irish spelling of his first name. His first national exposure came in an advert for Barbican non-alcoholic lager.[12] In 1984, he starred in *David and Jonathan* by William Douglas-Home at the Redgrave Theatre in Farnham.[13] Between 1986 and 1988, he was a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company, appearing in productions of *Romeo and Juliet*, *The Fair Maid of the West*, and *A Midsummer Night's Dream*.[14][15] He appeared in his first film, Derek Jarman's *Caravaggio* (1986), opposite Tilda Swinton, playing Ranuccio Tomassoni, followed by the same director's *War Requiem* (1988). In 1989, he starred as the evil Dominic O'Brien in *The Fifteen Streets*, where he gained a dedicated following.\n\n\nDuring the late 1980s and early 1990s, Bean became an established actor on British television.[16] In 1990, Bean starred in Jim Sheridan's adaptation of the John B. Keane play *The Field*. Also in 1990, his role as the journalist Anton in *Windprints* examined the difficult problems of apartheid in South Africa. He appeared in the BBC productions *Clarissa* (1991) (with Saskia Wickham and Lynsey Baxter) and *Lady Chatterley* (1993) (with Joely Richardson).[17] In 1996, he combined his love of football with his career to finally achieve his childhood dream of playing for Sheffield United, starring as Jimmy Muir in the film *When Saturday Comes*.[18] Although the film was not critically acclaimed, Bean received credit for a good performance.[19] In August 1997, Bean appeared in what became a famous Sky Sports commercial for the upcoming 1997–98 Premier League season.[20] His football related work continued in 1998 when he narrated *La Coupe de la Gloire*, the official film of the 1998 FIFA World Cup held in France.[21]\n\n\nBean's critical successes in *Caravaggio* and *Lady Chatterley* contributed to his emerging image as a sex symbol, but he became most closely associated with the character of Richard Sharpe, the maverick Napoleonic Wars rifleman in the ITV television series *Sharpe*. The series was based on Bernard Cornwell's novels about the Peninsular War, and the fictional experiences of a band of soldiers in the famed 95th Rifles. Starting with *Sharpe's Rifles*, the series followed the fortunes and misfortunes of Richard Sharpe as he rose from the ranks as a Sergeant, promoted to Lieutenant in Portugal, to Lieutenant Colonel by the time of the Battle of Waterloo.\n\n\nBean was not the first actor to be chosen to play Sharpe. As Paul McGann was injured while playing football two days into filming, the producers initially tried to work around his injury, but it proved impossible and Bean replaced him. The series ran continuously from 1993 to 1997, with three episodes produced each year. It was filmed under challenging conditions, first in Ukraine and later in Portugal. After several years of rumours, more episodes were produced: *Sharpe's Challenge*, which aired in April 2006, and *Sharpe's Peril*, which aired in autumn 2008 and was later released on DVD.[22] Both of these were released as two cinema-length 90-minute episodes per series.[23] With a role as enigmatic Lord Richard Fenton in the TV miniseries *Scarlett*, Bean made the transition to Hollywood feature films. His first notable Hollywood appearance was that of an Irish republican terrorist in the 1992 film adaptation of *Patriot Games*. While filming his death scene, Harrison Ford hit him with a boat hook, giving him a permanent scar. Bean's rough-cut looks made him a patent choice for a villain, and his role in *Patriot Games* was the first of several villains that he would portray, all of whom die in gruesome ways.[24]\n\n\n\n![](image)Bean at a press conference for Ridley Scott's *The Martian*, 2015 Toronto Film Festival\nIn the 1995 film *GoldenEye*, Bean portrayed James Bond's nemesis Alec Trevelyan (MI6's 006).[25] He played the weak-stomached Spence in *Ronin* (1998), a wife-beating ex-con in *Essex Boys* (2000), and a malevolent kidnapper/jewel thief in *Don't Say a Word* (2001). He was also widely recognised as villainous treasure hunter Ian Howe in *National Treasure*, and played a villainous scientist in *The Island* (2005). In the independent film *Far North*, he plays a Russian mercenary who gets lost in the tundra and is rescued by an Inuit woman and her daughter, whom he later pits against one another.[26]\n\n\nBean's most prominent role was as Boromir in Peter Jackson's *The Lord of the Rings* trilogy. His major screen time occurs in the first instalment, *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring*. He appears briefly in flashbacks in *The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers* and *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King*, as well as in a scene from the extended edition of *The Two Towers*. Before casting finished, rumours circulated that Jackson had considered Bean for the role of Aragorn, but neither Bean nor Jackson confirmed this in subsequent interviews. Bean's fear of flying in helicopters caused him difficulties in mountainous New Zealand, where the trilogy was filmed. After a particularly rough ride, he vowed not to fly to a location again; in one instance, he chose to take a ski lift into the mountains while wearing his full costume (complete with shield, armour, and sword) and then hike the final few miles.[27][28]\n\n\nOther roles gave more scope for his acting abilities. In 1999's *Extremely Dangerous*, his character walked a fine line between villain and hero.[29] He became a repentant, poetry-reading Grammaton cleric who succumbs to his emotions in 2002's *Equilibrium*, a quirky alien cowboy in 2003's *The Big Empty*, and a sympathetic and cunning Odysseus in the 2004 film *Troy*. He appeared with other Hollywood stars in Moby's music video \"We Are All Made of Stars\" in February 2002.[30] In the same year, he returned to the stage in London performing in *Macbeth*.[31] Due to popular demand, the production ran until March 2003.\n\n\n\n![](image)Bean at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival\nBean has done voice-over work, mostly in the British advertising industry.[32] He has featured in television adverts for O2, Morrisons and Barnardos as well as for Acuvue and the Sci-Fi Channel in the United States. He also does the voice over for the National Blood Service's television and radio campaign. Bean has also filmed a TV ad for Yorkshire Tea, a United Kingdom brand of tea.[33] For the role playing video game, *The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion*, he voiced Martin Septim.[34] Bean's distinctive voice has also been used in the intro and outro segments of the BBC Formula 1 racing coverage for the 2011 and 2012 seasons.\n\n\nBean completed a one-hour pilot, *Faceless*, for US television. He has also appeared in *Outlaw*, an independent British production, and a remake of 1986 horror film, *The Hitcher* (released in January 2007); here he used an American accent again. In 2009, he appeared in the *Red Riding* trilogy as the malevolent John Dawson. He also appeared in *Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief* (2010), playing the role of Zeus, the king of Mount Olympus and god of the sky, thunder, and lightning. Also that year, Bean starred in *Cash*, playing the lead role of Pyke Kubic, a dangerous man determined to recover his wealth in a bad economy. *Cash* explored the role money plays in today's hard economic times. Bean also played the villain's twin brother, Reese. Bean starred in the first season of *Game of Thrones*, HBO's adaptation of the *A Song of Ice and Fire* novels by George R. R. Martin, playing the part of Lord Eddard \"Ned\" Stark.[35] Bean and Peter Dinklage were the two actors whose inclusion show runners David Benioff and D. B. Weiss considered necessary for the show to become a success, and for whose roles no other actors were considered. His portrayal won him critical praise; as *The A.V. Club*'s reviewer put it, he \"portrayed Ned as a man who knew he lived in the muck but hoped for better and assumed everyone else would come along for the ride.\"[36] HBO's promotional efforts focused on Bean as the show's leading man and best-known actor.\n\n\nIn August 2012, Bean appeared as cross-dressing teacher Simon in the opening episode of the second season of UK television series *Accused*, a role which would earn him a Royal Television Society best actor award.[37] He starred in *Soldiers of Fortune* and the 2012 film *Cleanskin*, in which he plays a secret service agent faced with the task of pursuing and eliminating a suicide bomber and his terrorist cell. In 2012 he also appeared in Tarsem Singh's Snow White film, *Mirror Mirror*, which was released in the U.S. in March. He also reprised his role as Christopher Da Silva in the *Silent Hill* film sequel *Silent Hill: Revelation*,[38] and co-starred in the ABC drama series *Missing*, which premiered in early 2012.[39]\n\n\nBean starred in the espionage television series *Legends* as Martin Odum, an FBI agent who takes on various fabricated identities to go undercover. The show was cancelled after its second season. An intensive viral marketing campaign was centred on the hashtag #DontKillSeanBean, focusing on the various deaths of his past characters and promising his character in *Legends* would not suffer the same fate.[40] The campaign culminated with a Funny or Die exclusive video featuring Bean filming a scene for the show where he's become so accustomed to dying on screen that he expects his character to die a bizarrely gruesome death despite the simplicity of the scene.[41]\n\n\nFrom 2015 to 2017, Bean starred in the ITV Encore drama series *The Frankenstein Chronicles*.[42] In that time, he also starred in multiple notable films including *Jupiter Ascending*, *Pixels*, and *The Martian*. In 2017, Bean starred in the BBC series *Broken* as the troubled priest Father Michael Kerrigan, which earned him a BAFTA award for Best Actor.[43] In 2019, Bean played a damaged veteran in the TV drama *World on Fire*, basing his interpretation on his late paternal grandfather.[44]\n\n\nOn 31 May 2020, Bean appeared on Josh Gad's YouTube series *Reunited Apart* which reunites the cast of popular movies through video-conferencing, and promotes donations to non-profit charities. The episode saw Bean reunited with fellow *Lord of the Rings* castmates Sean Astin, Orlando Bloom, Billy Boyd, Ian McKellen, Dominic Monaghan, Viggo Mortensen, Miranda Otto, John Rhys-Davies, Andy Serkis, Liv Tyler, Karl Urban, and Elijah Wood, plus composer Howard Shore, writer Philippa Boyens and director Peter Jackson.[45]\n\n\nIn 2021, the actor was reunited with Jimmy McGovern (author of *Broken* and *Accused*) and Stephen Graham (his co-star in *Tracie's Story*) for the 3-part BBC prison drama *Time*.[46]\n\n\nIn September 2021, it was announced that Stefan Golaszewski's new drama, *Marriage* would air in 2022 and would star Bean alongside Nicola Walker.[47][48] The series opened to mixed reviews from both critics and viewers.[49][50][51][52][53]\n\n\n\n## Public image[edit]\n\n\n### Personality[edit]\n\n\nBean is often described as \"down to earth\" and has retained his Yorkshire accent.[17] He says that he does not mind being considered as a \"bit of rough\" by women.[54] He has developed a reputation as a loner, a label that he considers unfair.[17] He has described himself instead as quiet, and interviewers confirm that he is a \"man of few words\",[55] with one interviewer calling him \"surprisingly shy\".[56] He admits that he can be a workaholic; he reads books or listens to music in his spare time, and is a skilled pianist. He is also a keen gardener, welder, and sketcher.[57] Popular in his home county, a 2018 poll for Yorkshire Day saw Bean ranked the second greatest Yorkshireman ever behind Monty Python comedian, and fellow Sheffielder, Michael Palin.[58]\n\n\n\n### Acting style[edit]\n\n\nDespite being professionally trained, Bean adopted an instinctive style of acting that some say makes him especially well-suited to portraying his characters' depths.[59] He has said that the most difficult part is at the start of filming when trying to understand the character.[60] After achieving this, he can snap in and out of character instantly. This ability to go from the quiet man on set to the warrior Boromir \"amazed\" Sean Astin during filming of *The Fellowship of the Ring*.[61] Other fans include directors Mike Figgis and Wolfgang Petersen, who described working with Bean as a \"beautiful thing\".[59]\n\n\n\n### Deaths of characters[edit]\n\n\nBean's characters tend to die on screen, a phenomenon that has gained notoriety on the internet and in *The Lord of The Rings*, *Game of Thrones* and James Bond fandoms. In September 2019, Bean revealed that he had been turning down roles that would have his character killed following *Game of Thrones*, so that his performances would not become predictable.[62][63] Bean's favourite on-screen death is Boromir in *The Fellowship of the Ring*: \"I thought his death was very heroic and triumphant and poignant. It had pathos.\"[64] A reputation for frequently portraying characters who are violently killed has earned Bean the status of an Internet meme.[65]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nBean has been married five times and divorced four times. He married his secondary school sweetheart Debra James on 11 April 1981, and they were divorced in 1988. He met actress Melanie Hill at RADA, and they were married on 27 February 1990. Their first daughter was born in October 1987, and their second was born in September 1991. Their marriage ended in divorce in August 1997. During the filming of *Sharpe*, Bean met actress Abigail Cruttenden, and they were married on 22 November 1997. Their daughter was born in November 1998. They were divorced in July 2000. In addition to his three children, Bean has four grandchildren.[66]\n\n\nBean began dating actress Georgina Sutcliffe in 2006. After cancelling their planned January 2008 wedding on the eve of the ceremony for \"personal reasons\", he married Sutcliffe at the Marylebone Town Hall in London on 19 February 2008.[67] During allegations that Bean physically abused Sutcliffe in 2009,[56] domestic disturbances resulted in the police being called to their home in Belsize Park on three occasions. Bean and Sutcliffe's separation was announced on 6 August 2010,[68] and a decree nisi was granted on 21 December 2010.[69] He married Ashley Moore on 30 June 2017.[70]\n\n\nBean has been a fan of Sheffield United (the \"Blades\") since he was eight years old, and has a tattoo on his left shoulder that reads \"100% Blade\".[71][72] He opened their Hall of Fame in 2001 and, after making a six-figure contribution to the club's finances, was on their board of directors between 2002 and 2007 to help raise the profile of the club. He stepped down in 2007 to \"go back to being an ordinary supporter\" where he feels at home.[73] During his time there, he had a dispute with Neil Warnock, former manager of Sheffield United, after Warnock claimed that Bean stormed into his office and shouted at him in front of his wife and daughter when the club had just been relegated from the Premier League. Bean denies it, calling Warnock \"bitter\" and \"hypocritical\".[74] He wrote the foreword and helped to promote a book of anecdotes called *Sheffield United: The Biography*.[75] He also follows Yorkshire County Cricket Club.[76]\n\n\nBean has a tattoo of the number nine on his shoulder, written using Tengwar, in reference to his involvement in the *Lord of the Rings* films and the fact that his character was one of the original nine companions of the Fellowship of the Ring. Seven of the other actors of \"The Fellowship\" (Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Orlando Bloom, Billy Boyd, Ian McKellen, Dominic Monaghan, and Viggo Mortensen) have the same tattoo. John Rhys-Davies, whose character was also one of the original nine companions, arranged for his stunt double to get the tattoo instead.[77]\n\n\nAligned with the British left, in 2015 Bean expressed support for Jeremy Corbyn and for \"old Labour\", the era before Tony Blair rebranded the party as New Labour; Bean also spoke of his admiration for Tony Benn.[78]\n\n\nBean is a Christian[79] and a keen gardener in his spare time.[80]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1984 | *Winter Flight* | Hooker |  |\n| 1986 | *Caravaggio* | Ranuccio |  |\n| 1988 | *Stormy Monday* | Brendan |  |\n| 1989 | *How to Get Ahead in Advertising* | Larry Frisk |  |\n| *The Fifteen Streets* | Dominic O'Brien |  |\n| *War Requiem* | German Soldier |  |\n| 1990 | *Windprints* | Anton |  |\n| *The Field* | Tadgh McCabe |  |\n| 1992 | *Patriot Games* | Sean Miller |  |\n| 1994 | *Shopping* | Venning |  |\n| *Black Beauty* | Farmer Grey |  |\n| 1995 | *GoldenEye* | Alec Trevelyan / Janus |  |\n| 1996 | *When Saturday Comes* | Jimmy Muir |  |\n| 1997 | *Anna Karenina* | Vronsky |  |\n| 1998 | *Ronin* | Spence |  |\n| *Airborn* | Dave Toombs |  |\n| 1999 | *Bravo Two Zero* | Andy McNab |  |\n| 2000 | *Essex Boys* | Jason Locke |  |\n| 2001 | *Don't Say a Word* | Patrick Koster |  |\n| *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring* | Boromir |  |\n| 2002 | *The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers* | Extended edition only\n |\n| *Equilibrium* | Errol Partridge |  |\n| *Tom and Thomas* | Paul Shepherd |  |\n| 2003 | *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* | Boromir |  |\n| *The Big Empty* | Cowboy |  |\n| 2004 | *National Treasure* | Ian Howe |  |\n| *Troy* | Odysseus |  |\n| 2005 | *North Country* | Kyle Dodge |  |\n| *Flightplan* | Captain Marcus Rich |  |\n| *The Island* | Dr. Merrick |  |\n| *The Dark* | James |  |\n| 2006 | *Silent Hill* | Chris Da Silva |  |\n| 2007 | *The Hitcher* | John Ryder |  |\n| *Outlaw* | Danny Bryant |  |\n| *Far North* | Loki |  |\n| 2010 | *Black Death* | Ulric |  |\n| *Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief* | Zeus |  |\n| *Cash* | Pyke Kubic / Reese Kubic |  |\n| *Death Race 2* | Markus Kane | Direct-to-DVD\n |\n| 2011 | *Age of Heroes* | Jones |  |\n| 2012 | *Cleanskin* | Ewan |  |\n| *Soldiers of Fortune* | Dimidov |  |\n| *Mirror Mirror* | The King, Snow White's father |  |\n| *Silent Hill: Revelation* | Christopher Da Silva / Harry Mason |  |\n| 2014 | *Wicked Blood* | Frank Stinson |  |\n| 2015 | *The Snow Queen 2: The Snow King* | Arrog | Voice\n |\n| *Any Day* | Vian |  |\n| *Jupiter Ascending* | Stinger Apini |  |\n| *Pixels* | Corporal Hill |  |\n| *The Martian* | Mitch Henderson |  |\n| 2016 | *The Young Messiah* | Severus |  |\n| *Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV* | King Regis | Voice[81] |\n| 2017 | *Drone* | Neil |  |\n| *Dark River* | Richard Bell |  |\n| *The Unconquered* | Narrator | Voice; short film[82] |\n| 2018 | *Taniel* | Narrator | Voice; short film\n |\n| 2020 | *Possessor* | John Parse |  |\n| *Wolfwalkers* | Bill Goodfellowe | Voice\n |\n| 2023 | *Mummies* | Pharaoh | Voice\n |\n| *Knights of the Zodiac* | Alman Kiddo (Mitsumasa Kido) | Lead role[83] |\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1984\n | *The Bill* | Horace Clark\n | Episode: \"Long Odds\"\n |\n| 1985\n | *Exploits at West Poley* | Scarred Man\n | Television film\n |\n| 1986\n | *The Practice* | Terry Donlan\n | 2 episodes\n |\n| 1988\n | *The Storyteller* | The Prince\n | Episode: \"The True Bride\"\n |\n| *Troubles* | Capt.

After beginning his career on the British stage as a leading member of the Royal Shakespeare Company, he became a successful and prolific performer on television and in films. He received numerous accolades including two BAFTA Awards and a Tony Award, along with nominations for an Academy Award and two Emmy Awards. He was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1989 by Queen Elizabeth II.[1][2]\n\n\nHolm won the 1967 Tony Award for Best Featured Actor for his performance as Lenny in the Harold Pinter play *The Homecoming*. He won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor for his performance in the title role in the 1998 West End production of *King Lear*. For his television roles he received two Primetime Emmy Award nominations for *King Lear* (1998), and the HBO film *The Last of the Blonde Bombshells* (2003).\n\n\nHe gained acclaim for his role in *The Bofors Gun* (1968) winning the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, and won a second BAFTA Award for his role as athletics trainer Sam Mussabini in *Chariots of Fire* (1981). Other notable films he appeared in include *Alien* (1979), *Brazil* (1985), *Henry V* (1989), *Naked Lunch* (1991), *The Madness of King George* (1994), *The Fifth Element* (1997), *The Sweet Hereafter* (1997), and *The Aviator* (2004). He gained wider appreciation for his role as the elderly Bilbo Baggins in Peter Jackson's *The Lord of the Rings* and *The Hobbit* trilogies. He also voiced Chef Skinner in the Pixar animated film *Ratatouille* (2007).\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nIan Holm Cuthbert was born on 12 September 1931 in Goodmayes, Essex, to Scottish parents, James Harvey Cuthbert and his wife Jean Wilson (née Holm).[3] His father was a psychiatrist who worked as the superintendent of the West Ham Corporation Mental Hospital and was one of the pioneers of electric shock therapy; his mother was a nurse.[4][5][6][7] He had an older brother, who died when Ian was 12 years old.[8] Holm was educated at the independent Chigwell School in Essex.[8][9] His parents retired to Mortehoe in Devon and then to Worthing, where he joined an amateur dramatic society.[10]\n\n\nA chance encounter with Henry Baynton, a well-known provincial Shakespearean actor, helped Holm train for admission to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, where he secured a place from 1950.[9][11] His studies were interrupted a year later when he was called up for National Service in the British Army,[11] during which he was posted to Klagenfurt, Austria, and attained the rank of Lance Corporal. They were interrupted a second time when he volunteered to go on an acting tour of the United States in 1952.[10] Holm graduated from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in 1953.[9]\n\n\nHe made his stage debut in 1954, at Stratford-upon-Avon, playing a spear-carrier in a staging of *Othello*.[12] Two years later, he made his London stage debut in *Love Affair*.[12]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nHolm was an established star of the Royal Shakespeare Company before gaining notice in television and film. In 1965, he played Richard III in the BBC serialisation of *The Wars of The Roses*, based on the RSC production of the plays. In 1969, he appeared in *Moonlight on the Highway*.[13] He appeared in minor roles in films such as *Oh! What a Lovely War* (1969),[14] *Nicholas and Alexandra* (1971),[15] *Mary, Queen of Scots* (1972)[16] and *Young Winston* (1972).[17]\n\n\nIn 1967 Holm won a Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play as Lenny in *The Homecoming* by Harold Pinter. In 1977, Holm appeared in the television mini-series *Jesus of Nazareth* as the Sadducee Zerah, and a villainous Moroccan in *March or Die*. The following year he played J. M. Barrie in the award-winning BBC mini-series *The Lost Boys*,[18] In 1981, he played Frodo Baggins in the BBC radio adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's *The Lord of the Rings*.[19]\n\n\nHolm's first film role to gain much notice was that of Ash, the \"calm, technocratic\" science officer – later revealed to be an android – in Ridley Scott's science-fiction film *Alien* (1979).[20] His portrayal of the running coach Sam Mussabini in *Chariots of Fire* (1981) earned him a special award at the Cannes Film Festival, a BAFTA award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, and an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.[20][21][22] In the 1980s, Holm had memorable roles in *Time Bandits* (1981), *Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes* (1984) and *Brazil* (1985). He played Lewis Carroll, the author of *Alice in Wonderland*, in *Dreamchild* (1985).[23][24]\n\n\nIn 1989, Holm was nominated for a BAFTA award for the television series *Game, Set and Match*. Based on the novels by Len Deighton, this tells the story of an intelligence officer (Holm) who learns that his own wife is an enemy spy. He also continued to perform Shakespeare in films. He appeared with Kenneth Branagh in *Henry V* (1989) and as Polonius to Mel Gibson's *Hamlet* (1990). Holm was reunited with Branagh in *Mary Shelley's Frankenstein* (1994), playing the father of Branagh's Victor Frankenstein.[25]\n\n\nHolm raised his profile in 1997 with two prominent roles, as the priest Vito Cornelius in Luc Besson's sci-fi *The Fifth Element* and lawyer Mitchell Stephens in *The Sweet Hereafter*. In 2001 he starred in *From Hell* as the physician Sir William Withey Gull. The same year, he appeared as Bilbo Baggins in the blockbuster film *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring*, having previously played Bilbo's nephew Frodo Baggins in the 1981 BBC Radio adaptation of *The Lord of the Rings*. He returned for *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* (2003), for which he shared a SAG award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. He later reprised his role as the elderly Bilbo Baggins in the movie *The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey* and *The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies*.[11] Martin Freeman portrayed the young Bilbo Baggins in those films.[26]\n\n\nHolm was nominated for an Emmy Award twice, for a PBS broadcast of a National Theatre production of *King Lear*, in 1999; and for a supporting role in the HBO film *The Last of the Blonde Bombshells* opposite Judi Dench, in 2001.[27] He appeared in two David Cronenberg films: *Naked Lunch* (1991) and *eXistenZ* (1999).[20] He was Harold Pinter's favourite actor: the playwright once said: \"He puts on my shoe, and it fits!\"[28] Holm played Lenny in both the London and New York City premieres of Pinter's *The Homecoming*.[22] He played Napoleon Bonaparte three times: in the television mini-series *Napoleon and Love* (1974), Terry Gilliam's *Time Bandits* (1981), and *The Emperor's New Clothes*.[18]\n\n\nHolm also received royal recognition for his contributions: He was made CBE in 1989 and knighted in 1998.[9]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nHolm was married four times:[29] to Lynn Mary Shaw in 1955 (divorced 1965); to Sophie Baker in 1982 (divorced 1986); to actress Penelope Wilton, in Wiltshire,[30] in 1991 (divorced 2002); and to the artist Sophie de Stempel in 2003. He had two daughters from his first marriage, a son from his second marriage, and a son and daughter from his 15-year relationship with photographer Bee Gilbert.[31]\n\n\nHolm and Wilton appeared together in the BBC miniseries *The Borrowers* (1993). His last wife, Sophie de Stempel, is a protégée and was a life model of Lucian Freud,[32] as well as an artist in her own right.\n\n\nHolm was treated for prostate cancer in 2001.[29]\n\n\n\n## Death[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Grave of Ian Holm in Highgate Cemetery\nHolm had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.[33][34][35] He died in hospital in London on 19 June 2020 at the age of 88.[36] His ashes are interred on the western side of Highgate Cemetery.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1968\n | *The Bofors Gun* | Flynn\n |  | [37] |\n| *The Fixer* | Grubeshov\n |  | [37] |\n| *A Midsummer Night's Dream* | Puck |  | [37] |\n| 1969\n | *Oh!

He studied visual arts and theatre as part of his degree at Lancaster University and graduated in 1985.[15] Serkis was a member of The County College and part of the student radio station Bailrigg FM.[16] He joined the Nuffield Studio, getting involved in designing and producing plays.[17]\n\n\nHaving agreed to act in a couple of productions towards the end of his first year, Serkis played the lead role in Barrie Keeffe's play *Gotcha* as a rebellious teenager holding a teacher hostage. As a result, he changed his major subject to acting, constructing his Independent Studies Degree around acting and set design, studying Konstantin Stanislavski and Bertolt Brecht, and including minor modules in art and visual graphics.[18] In his final year at Lancaster he adapted Raymond Briggs's graphic novel *The Tin-Pot Foreign General and the Old Iron Woman*, a satire about the Falklands War, as a one-man show, which he performed to acclaim.[19]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nIn his third year at university, Serkis joined the backstage team at the local Duke's Playhouse to earn his Equity card. On graduating, although advised to take a one-year post-graduate acting course, he joined Dukes as an actor. Under director Jonathan Petherbridge, who used workshops based on the methods of Augusto Boal, he spent 18 months acting in a broad range of productions from Brecht, Shakespeare and modern British playwrights.[20]\n\n\nAfter 16 months, and having gained his Equity card, Serkis joined a series of touring companies, including productions of: *Bouncers* opposite Hull Truck; Florizel in *The Winter's Tale*; and the fool in *King Lear* with director Max Stafford-Clark.[20] In the early 1990s he settled in London, and took a role in April De Angelis's *Hush* (Royal Court) as Dogboy. Also the Royal Court Theatre's production of *Mojo,* and Wilson Milam's production of *Hurlyburly* (1997) at the Queen's Theatre, Shaftesbury Avenue, with Rupert Graves and David Tennant.[21] Serkis also developed a career in television, appearing in small roles such as Greville in an episode of *The Darling Buds of May* (1992) and a criminal called Maxwell in an episode of *Pie in the Sky* (1994). Serkis joined director Mike Leigh's ensemble for two film productions, and appeared in the romantic comedy *Loop* (1997) alongside Susannah York. Serkis portrayed Victorian choreographer John D'Auban in *Topsy-Turvy*, a 1999 film about Gilbert and Sullivan's creation of *The Mikado*.[22] In 1999, Serkis played Bill Sikes in ITV's adaptation of *Oliver Twist*.[23] He appeared alongside Sacha Baron Cohen in *The Jolly Boys' Last Stand* in 2000.[24]\n\n\n\n![](image)Serkis at the world premiere of *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* in Wellington in 2003\nSerkis first came to wide public notice for his performance as Sméagol / Gollum, in *The Lord of the Rings* film trilogy (2001–2003), for which he provided motion-capture movements and voice for the CGI character. His work on *The Lord of the Rings* started a debate on the legitimacy of CGI-assisted acting. Some critics felt Serkis should have been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, since his voice, body language and facial expressions were used.[25]\n\n\nSerkis has performed motion-capture work in several other films, including the title character in the 2005 version of King Kong (in which he also played the ship's cook in live-action) and as Caesar in *Rise of the Planet of the Apes* (2011), *Dawn of the Planet of the Apes* (2014), and *War for the Planet of the Apes* (2017). He also worked with game developers Ninja Theory on the 2007 release *Heavenly Sword*, providing the motion capture and voice for King Bohan (the game's main villain).[26][27]\n\n\nIn 2006, Serkis starred as serial killer Ian Brady in the BAFTA-nominated *Longford*, co-starring Samantha Morton as Myra Hindley and Jim Broadbent as Lord Longford. That same year, Serkis appeared in the role of Mr. Grin in the film rendition of Anthony Horowitz's *Alex Rider* novel *Stormbreaker*.

In 2007, he appeared in *Sugarhouse*, a low-budget independently made film, playing local crime lord Hoodwink, who terrorises an east London housing estate. For the role, Serkis shaved his head and had sessions lasting 20 hours each to have temporary tattoos stencilled onto his body. The film premiered at the 2007 Edinburgh Festival and released in the UK on 24 August. Also that year, Serkis provided the voiceover for *Monkey Life*, on Five broadcast for three weeks from 13 to 31 August 2007. This series was about Monkey World, the popular ape and monkey sanctuary and zoo near Wool, Dorset.

He played Caesar in the 20th Century Fox science-fiction film *Rise of the Planet of the Apes*.[35] Serkis was acclaimed for his performance as Caesar in 2011, and in a high-profile campaign by 20th Century Fox for him to be honoured with a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination, his co-star James Franco stated: \"Andy Serkis is the undisputed master of the newest kind of acting called 'motion capture,' and it is time that Serkis gets credit for the innovative artist that he is.\"[26] In 2010, Serkis played Monkey, the lead character along with Lindsey Shaw in the videogame *Enslaved: Odyssey to the West*.[36][37]\n\n\n\n![](image)Serkis promoting *Dawn of the Planet of the Apes* at the 2014 San Diego Comic-Con\nIn January 2011, it was confirmed that Serkis would reprise the role of Gollum in *The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey* the first film in the three-part *The Hobbit* films.

Davis came in 3rd place at the 7th ceremony in 1935, while Muni came in 2nd place at the 8th ceremony in 1936; however, the Academy does not recognize either as official nominees for those years[9][10] though both actors remain listed as nominees in the Academy's database.[11][12]\n3. **^** George C.

Davis came in 3rd place at the 7th ceremony in 1935, while Muni came in 2nd place at the 8th ceremony in 1936; however, the Academy does not recognize either as official nominees for those years[9][10] though both actors remain listed as nominees in the Academy's database.[11][12]\n3. **^** George C.
