The competition is contested by UEFA members' senior men's national teams, determining the continental champion of Europe. It is the second-most watched football tournament in the world after the FIFA World Cup. The Euro 2012 final was watched by a global audience of around 300 million.[2] The competition has been held every four years since 1960, except for 2020, when it was postponed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, but kept the name Euro 2020. Scheduled to be in the even-numbered year between FIFA World Cup tournaments, it was originally called the **European Nations' Cup** before changing to its current name in 1968. Since 1996, the individual events have been branded as \"**UEFA Euro [year]**\".\n\n\nBefore entering the tournament, all teams other than the host nations (which qualify automatically) compete in a qualifying process. Until 2016, the championship winners could compete in the following year's FIFA Confederations Cup, but were not obliged to do so.[3] From the 2020 edition onwards, the winner competes in the CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions.\n\n\nThe sixteen European Championship tournaments have been won by ten national teams: Germany and Spain have each won three titles, Italy and France have won two titles, and the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, the Netherlands, Denmark, Greece and Portugal have won one title each. To date, Spain is the only team to have won consecutive titles, doing so in 2008 and 2012.\n\n\nThe most recent championship, held across Europe in 2021 (postponed from 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic), was won by Italy, who lifted their second European title after beating England in the final at Wembley Stadium in London on penalties.[4][5]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Beginnings[edit]\n\n\nRegional tournaments for national teams existed before the advent of a truly pan-European competition. Starting in 1883, the British Home Championship was an annual competition contested between the United Kingdom's four national teams, England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland. Until these national teams entered the FIFA World Cup in 1950, it was the most important international tournament these nations competed in. Similarly, from 1927 until 1960, the Central European International Cup was held six times. It brought together the national teams of Austria, Hungary, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, and Yugoslavia. The idea for a pan-European football tournament was first proposed by the French Football Federation's secretary-general Henri Delaunay in 1927, but it was not until 1958 that the tournament was started, three years after Delaunay's death.[6] In honour of Delaunay, the trophy awarded to the champions is named after him.[7] The 1960 tournament, held in France, had four teams competing in the finals out of 17 that entered the competition.[8] It was won by the Soviet Union, beating Yugoslavia 2–1 in a tense final in Paris.[9] Spain withdrew from its quarter-final match against the Soviet Union because of two political protests.[10] Of the 17 teams that entered the qualifying tournament, notable absentees were England, the Netherlands, West Germany and Italy.[11]\n\n\nSpain held the next tournament in 1964, which saw an increase in entries to the qualification tournament, with 29 entering;[12] West Germany was a notable absentee once again and Greece withdrew after being drawn against Albania, with whom they were still at war.[13] The hosts beat the title holders, the Soviet Union, 2–1 at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid.[14]\n\n\nThe tournament format stayed the same for the 1968 tournament, hosted and won by Italy.[15][16] For the first and only time, a match was decided on a coin toss (the semi-final between Italy and the Soviet Union)[17] and the final went to a replay, after the match against Yugoslavia finished 1–1.[18] Italy won the replay 2–0.[19] More teams entered this tournament (31), a testament to its burgeoning popularity.[20]\n\n\nBelgium hosted the 1972 tournament, which West Germany won, beating the Soviet Union 3–0 in the final, with goals coming from Gerd Müller (twice) and Herbert Wimmer at the Heysel Stadium in Brussels.[21] This tournament would provide a taste of things to come, as the German side contained many of the key members of the 1974 FIFA World Cup Champions.[22][23]\n\n\nThe 1976 tournament in Yugoslavia was the last in which only four teams took part in the final tournament, and the last in which the hosts had to qualify. Czechoslovakia beat West Germany in the newly introduced penalty shootout. After seven successful conversions, Uli Hoeneß missed, leaving Czechoslovakian Antonín Panenka with the opportunity to score and win the tournament. An \"audacious\" chipped shot,[24] described by UEFA as \"perhaps the most famous spot kick of all time\" secured the victory as Czechoslovakia won 5–3 on penalties.[25]\n\n\n\n### Expansion to 8 teams[edit]\n\n\nThe competition was expanded to eight teams in the 1980 tournament, again hosted by Italy. It involved a group stage, with the winners of the groups going on to contest the final, and the runners-up playing in the third place play-off.[26] West Germany won their second European title by beating Belgium 2–1, with two goals scored by Horst Hrubesch at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome.[27] Horst Hrubesch scored early in the first half before René Vandereycken equalised for Belgium with a penalty in the second half. With two minutes remaining, Hrubesch headed the winner for West Germany from a Karl-Heinz Rummenigge corner.[28]\n\n\nFrance won their first major title at home in the 1984 tournament, with their captain Michel Platini scoring 9 goals in just 5 games, including the opening goal in the final, in which they beat Spain 2–0.[29][30] The format also changed, with the top two teams in each group going through to a semi-final stage, instead of the winners of each group going straight into the final. The third place play-off was also abolished.[31]\n\n\n\n![](image)Ruud Gullit and the Netherlands team celebrating their victory in 1988\nWest Germany hosted UEFA Euro 1988, but lost 2–1 to the Netherlands, their traditional rivals, in the semi-finals, which sparked vigorous celebrations in the Netherlands.[32][33] The Netherlands went on to win the tournament in a rematch of their first game of the group stage, beating the Soviet Union 2–0 at the Olympia Stadion in Munich.[34] Marco van Basten scored the second goal, a volley over the keeper from the right wing which is often considered one of the best goals ever scored.[35]\n\n\nUEFA Euro 1992 was held in Sweden, and was won by Denmark, who were only in the finals after UN sanctions prevented Yugoslavia's participation as some of the states constituting the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia were at war with each other.[36][37] The Danes beat holders the Netherlands on penalties in the semi-finals,[38] then defeated world champion Germany 2–0.[39] This was the first tournament in which a unified Germany took part and also the first major tournament to have the players' names printed on their backs.\n\n\n\n### Expansion to 16 teams[edit]\n\n\nEngland hosted UEFA Euro 1996, the first tournament to use the nomenclature \"Euro [year]\" and would see the number of teams taking part double to 16.[40] The hosts, in a replay of the 1990 FIFA World Cup semi-final, were knocked out on penalties by Germany.[41] The surprise team of the tournament was the newly formed Czech Republic, participating on its first international competition following the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, which reached the final after beating Portugal and France in the knockout stage. Germany would go on to win the Final 2–1 thanks to the first golden goal ever in a major tournament, scored by Oliver Bierhoff five minutes into extra time.[42][43] This was Germany's first title as a unified nation.\n\n\nUEFA Euro 2000 was the first tournament to be held by two countries, in the Netherlands and Belgium.[44] France, the reigning World Cup champions, were favoured to win, and they lived up to expectations when they beat Italy 2–1 after extra time, having come from being 1–0 down: Sylvain Wiltord equalised in the last minute of regular time and David Trezeguet scored the winning golden goal in extra time.[45]\n\n\n\n![](image)The UEFA Euro 2004 opening ceremony in Portugal.\nUEFA Euro 2004, like 1992, produced an upset: Greece, who had only qualified for one World Cup (1994) and one European Championship (1980) before, beat hosts Portugal 1–0 in the final (after having also beaten them in the opening game) with a goal scored by Angelos Charisteas in the 57th minute to win a tournament that they had been given odds of 150–1 to win before it began[46] (being the second least likely team to have any success after Latvia)[*citation needed*]. On their way to the Final, they also beat holders France[47] as well as the Czech Republic with a silver goal,[48][49] a rule which replaced the previous golden goal in 2003, before being abolished itself shortly after this tournament.\n\n\nThe 2008 tournament, hosted by Austria and Switzerland, marked the second time that two nations co-hosted and the first edition where the new trophy was awarded.[50] It commenced on 7 June and finished on 29 June.[51] The Final between Germany and Spain was held at the Ernst Happel Stadion in Vienna.[52] Spain defeated Germany 1–0, with a goal scored by Fernando Torres in the 33rd minute, sparking much celebration across the country.[53] This was their first title since the 1964 tournament. Spain were the highest scoring team with 12 goals scored and David Villa finished as the top scorer with four goals. Xavi was awarded the player of the tournament, and nine Spanish players were picked for the team of the tournament.\n\n\nThe UEFA Euro 2012 tournament was co-hosted by Poland and Ukraine.[54] Spain defeated Italy 4–0 in the Final, thus becoming the first nation to defend a European Championship title, as well as the first European team to win three consecutive major tournaments.[55] In scoring the third goal of the final, Torres became the first player to score in two European Championship finals. He was equal top scorer for the tournament with three goals in total, along with Mario Balotelli, Alan Dzagoev, Mario Gómez, Mario Mandžukić, and Cristiano Ronaldo, despite only being used as a substitute player. The tournament was otherwise notable for having the most headed goals in a Euro tournament (26 out of 76 goals in total); a disallowed goal in the England versus Ukraine group game which replays showed had crossed the goal line, and which prompted President of FIFA Sepp Blatter to tweet, \"GLT (Goal-line technology) is no longer an alternative but a necessity\",[56] thus reversing his long-held reluctance to embrace such technology; and some crowd violence in group games.\n\n\n\n### Expansion to 24 teams[edit]\n\n\nIn 2007, the Football Association of Ireland and Scottish Football Association proposed the expansion of the tournament, which was later confirmed by the UEFA Executive Committee in September 2008.[57][58] Out of the 54 member associations of UEFA, only three, including England and Germany, opposed the expansion.[59] On 28 May 2010, UEFA announced that UEFA Euro 2016 would be hosted by France. France beat bids of Turkey (7–6 in voting in the second voting round) and Italy, which had the fewest votes in the first voting round.[60] Euro 2016 was the first to have 24 teams in the finals.[61] This was the third time France have hosted the competition. Portugal, which qualified for the knock-out phase despite finishing third in its group, went on to win the championship by defeating heavily favoured host team France 1–0 in the Final, thanks to a goal from Eder in the 109th minute. Cristiano Ronaldo, Portugal's world-renowned striker, came out of the game due to injury in the 25th minute. This was the first time Portugal won a major tournament.\n\n\nFor the 2020 tournament, three bids were proposed, including a bid from Turkey,[62] a joint bid from the Republic of Ireland, Scotland and Wales,[63] and a joint bid from Georgia and Azerbaijan.[64] In December 2012, however, UEFA announced that the 2020 tournament would be hosted in several cities in various countries across Europe, with the semi-finals and Final being played in London.[65][66] The venues were selected and announced by UEFA on 19 September 2014.[67] However, Brussels was removed as a host city on 7 December 2017 due to delays with the building of the Eurostadium.[68] On 17 March 2020, UEFA announced that Euro 2020 would be delayed by a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, and proposed it take place from 11 June to 11 July 2021. The competition was postponed in order to reduce pressure on the public services in affected countries and to provide space in the calendar for the completion of domestic leagues that had been suspended.[69] Before the Euro 2020, Dublin was also removed as one of the host cities due to its inability to guarantee spectators to the stadium, while Bilbao was replaced by Seville for the same reason.[70][71] In the Final, Italy defeated maiden finalists England 3–2 on penalties, after the game was tied 1–1 after extra time, to win their second European Championship.[72]\n\n\n\n## Trophy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The trophy on display in 2021\nThe Henri Delaunay Trophy, which is awarded to the winner of the European Championship, is named in honour of Henri Delaunay, the first General Secretary of UEFA, who came up with the idea of a European championship but died five years before the first tournament in 1960. His son Pierre was in charge of creating the trophy.[73] Since the first tournament it has been awarded to the winning team for them to keep for four years, until the next tournament. This trophy bore the words *Coupe d'Europe* (\"European Cup\"), *Coupe Henri Delaunay* (\"Henri Delaunay Cup\"), and *Championnat d'Europe* (\"European Championship\") on the front and a juggling boy on the back.\n\n\nFor the 2008 tournament, the Henri Delaunay Trophy was remodelled to make it larger, as the old trophy was overshadowed by UEFA's other trophies such as the new European Champion Clubs' Cup. The new trophy, which is made of sterling silver, now weighs 8 kilograms (18 lb) and is 60 centimetres (24 in) tall, being 2 kilograms (4.4 lb) heavier and 18 centimetres (7.1 in) longer than the old one. The marble plinth that was serving as base was removed. The new silver base of the trophy had to be enlarged to make it stable. The names of the winning countries that had appeared on the plaques glued to the plinth are now engraved on the back of the trophy,[74] under the word *Coupe Henri Delaunay* and are written in English rather than French its predecessor had. The 1972 and 1980 winning country, West Germany, is written as just *Germany*.[*citation needed*] Since 2016, the juggling boy was returned on the trophy's back.\n\n\nThe players and coaches of the winning team and the runner-up team are awarded gold and silver medals, respectively. Each association that competes in the final tournament receives a commemorative plaque. Each time the team losing semi-finalist, as well as each finalist, receive a dedicated plaque. Though there is no longer a third place play-off, UEFA decided in the 2008 edition to award the semi-final losers (Turkey and Russia) bronze medals for the first time,[75] and did the same in the 2012 edition when Germany and Portugal received bronze medals.[76] However, UEFA decided that losing semi-finalists would no longer receive medals from the 2016 edition onwards.[77] Bronze medals were previously awarded for winners of the third place play-off, the last of which was held in 1980.\n\n\n\n## Format[edit]\n\n\n### The competition[edit]\n\n\nBefore 1980, only four teams qualified for the final tournament. From 1980, eight teams competed. In 1996 the tournament expanded to 16 teams, since it was easier for European nations to qualify for the World Cup than their own continental championship; 14 of the 24 teams at the 1982, 1986 and 1990 World Cups had been European, whereas the European Championship finals still involved only eight teams.\n\n\nIn 2007, there was much discussion about an expansion of the tournament to 24 teams, started by Scotland and the Republic of Ireland, due to the increased number of football associations in Europe after the break-ups of Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, and the inclusion of Israel and Kazakhstan. The new president of UEFA, Michel Platini, was reported to be in favour of expansion which proved an accurate assumption. Whilst on 17 April 2007, UEFA's executive committee formally decided against expansion in 2012, Platini indicated in June 2008 that UEFA will increase participation from 16 to 24 teams in future tournaments, starting from 2016.[78] On 25 September, it was announced by Franz Beckenbauer that an agreement had been reached, and the expansion to 24 teams would be officially announced the next day.[79]\n\n\nThe competing teams are chosen by a series of qualifying games: in 1960 and 1964 through home and away play-offs; from 1968 through a combination of both qualifying groups and play-off games. The host country was selected from the four finalists after they were determined through qualifying.\n\n\nSince the expansion of the final tournament starting from 1980, the host country, or countries, have been chosen beforehand and qualify automatically.\n\n\nIn most tournaments, the tournament consists of a round-robin group stage followed by a single-elimination knockout stage.\n\n\n\n\n\n| No.\n | Year\n | Host\n | Teams\n | Matches\n | Round 1\n | Final stages\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 1960 | ![](image) France | 4\n | 4\n | knockout: 4 matches (not counting replays)\n |\n| 2\n | 1964 | ![](image) Spain |\n| 3\n | 1968 | ![](image) Italy | 5\n |\n| 4\n | 1972 | ![](image) Belgium | 4\n | knockout: 4 matches\n |\n| 5\n | 1976 | ![](image) Yugoslavia |\n| 6\n | 1980 | ![](image) Italy | 8\n | 14\n | 2 groups of 4 teams: 12 matches\n | final (round 1 group winners) and third-place match (round 1 group runners-up)\n |\n| 7\n | 1984 | ![](image) France | 15\n | knockout of 4 teams (round 1 group winners and runners-up): 3 matches\n |\n| 8\n | 1988 | ![](image) West Germany |\n| 9\n | 1992 | ![](image) Sweden |\n| 10\n | 1996 | ![](image) England | 16\n | 31\n | 4 groups of 4 teams: 24 matches\n | knockout of 8 teams (round 1 group winners and runners-up): 7 matches\n |\n| 11\n | 2000 | ![](image) Belgium![](image) Netherlands |\n| 12\n | 2004 | ![](image) Portugal |\n| 13\n | 2008 | ![](image) Austria![](image)  Switzerland |\n| 14\n | 2012 | ![](image) Poland![](image) Ukraine |\n| 15\n | 2016 | ![](image) France | 24\n | 51\n | 6 groups of 4 teams: 36 matches\n | knockout of 16 teams (round 1 group winners and runners-up, plus four best third-placed teams): 15 matches\n |\n| 16\n | 2020[s 1] | ![](image) Europe[s 2] |\n| *17* | *2024* | *![](image) Germany* |\n| *18* | *2028* | *![](image) England![](image) Northern Ireland![](image) Republic of Ireland![](image) Scotland![](image) Wales* |\n| *19* | *2032* | *![](image) Italy![](image) Turkey* |\n\n\n1. **^** Postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe\n2. **^** Pan–European edition hosted by eleven countries: Azerbaijan, Denmark, England, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Romania, Russia, Scotland and Spain\n\nUp to 1968 draws were to be broken via a coin toss in all matches but the final, draw in final match was resolved via a replay.\n\n\nNo third place play-off has been played since 1980.\n\n\n\n### Qualifying[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA European Championship qualifying\n\nTo qualify, a team must finish in one of the qualifying spots or win a play-off. After this, a team proceeds to the finals round in the host country, although hosts qualify for the tournament automatically. The qualifying phase begins in the autumn after the preceding FIFA World Cup, almost two years before the finals.\n\n\nThe groups for qualification are drawn by a UEFA committee using seeding. Seeded teams include reigning champions and other teams based on their performance in the preceding FIFA World Cup qualifying and the last European Championship qualifying. To obtain an accurate view of the teams' abilities, a ranking is produced. This is calculated by taking the total number of points won by a particular team and dividing it by the number of games played, i.e. points per game. In the case of a team having hosted one of the two previous competitions and therefore having qualified automatically, only the results from the single most recent qualifying competition are used. If two teams have equal points per game, the committee then bases their positions in the rankings on:\n\n\n\n1. Coefficient from the matches played in its most recent qualifying competition.\n2. Average goal difference.\n3. Average number of goals scored.\n4. Average number of away goals scored.\n5. Drawing of lots.\n\n\nThe qualifying phase is played in a group format, the composition of the groups is determined through means of a draw of teams from pre-defined seeded bowls. The draw takes place after the preceding World Cup's qualifying competition. For UEFA Euro 2020, the group qualifying phase consisted of ten groups; five of six teams and the remainder of five teams each.\n\n\nEach group is played in a league format with teams playing each other home and away. The top two teams then qualified for the final tournament, with remaining places decided by playoffs depending on their ranking in the UEFA Nations League. As with most leagues, the points are awarded as three for a win, one for a draw, and none for a loss. In the eventuality of one or more teams having equal points after all matches have been played, the following criteria are used to distinguish the sides:\n\n\n\n1. Higher number of points obtained in the group matches played among the teams in question.\n2. Superior goal difference from the group matches played among the teams in question.\n3. Higher number of goals scored in the group matches played among the teams in question.\n4. Higher number of goals scored away from home in the group matches played among the teams in question.\n5. Results of all group matches:\n\t1. Superior goal difference\n\t2. Higher number of goals scored\n\t3. Higher number of goals scored away from home\n\t4. Fair play conduct.\n6. Drawing of lots.\n\n\n### Final tournament[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of countries' best results. 10 countries have won, counting Germany and West Germany as one\nSixteen teams progressed to the final tournament for the 2012 tournament. They were joint hosts Poland and Ukraine, the winners and the highest ranked second-placed team from the nine qualifying groups as well as the winners of four play-off matches between the runners-up of the other groups. These sixteen teams were divided equally into four groups, A, B, C and D, each consisting of four teams. The groups were drawn up by the UEFA administration, again using seeding. The seeded teams being the host nations, the reigning champions, should they qualify, and those with the best points per game coefficients over the qualifying phase of the tournament and the previous World Cup qualifying. Other finalists were assigned to by means of a draw, using coefficients as a basis.\n\n\nFor the 2016 tournament, the expansion to 24 teams means that the teams will be drawn into six groups of four, with the six group winners, six group runners-up and the four best third-placed teams advancing to the round of 16 when it becomes a knockout competition.[77]\n\n\nThe groups are again played in a league format, where a team plays its opponents once each. The same points system is used (three points for a win, one point for a draw, no points for a defeat). A schedule for the group matches will be drawn up, but the last two matches in a group must kick off simultaneously. The winner and runner-up of each group progress to the next round, where a knockout system is used (the two teams play each other once, the winner progresses), this is used in all subsequent rounds as well. The winners of the quarter-finals matches progress to the semi-finals, where the winners play in the final. If in any of the knockout rounds, the scores are still equal after normal playing time, extra time and penalties are employed to separate the two teams. Unlike the FIFA World Cup, this tournament no longer has a third place playoff.\n\n\n\n## Results[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of UEFA European Championship finals\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Year\n | Host\n |  | Final\n |  | Third place playoff\n |  | Number of teams\n |\n| Winners\n | Score and venue\n | Runners-up\n | Third place\n | Score and venue\n | Fourth place\n |\n| 1960 | ![](image) France | **![](image)Soviet Union** | **2–1** (a.e.t.)Parc des Princes, Paris | ![](image)Yugoslavia | ![](image)Czechoslovakia | 2–0 Stade Vélodrome, Marseille | ![](image)France | 4\n |\n| 1964 | ![](image) Spain | **![](image)Spain** | **2–1**Santiago Bernabéu, Madrid | ![](image)Soviet Union | ![](image)Hungary | 3–1 (a.e.t.)Camp Nou, Barcelona | ![](image)Denmark | 4\n |\n| 1968 | ![](image) Italy | **![](image)Italy** | **1–1** (a.e.t.)**2–0** (replay)Stadio Olimpico, Rome | ![](image)Yugoslavia | ![](image)England | 2–0 Stadio Olimpico, Rome | ![](image)Soviet Union | 4\n |\n| 1972 | ![](image) Belgium | **![](image)West Germany** | **3–0**Heysel Stadium, Brussels | ![](image)Soviet Union | ![](image)Belgium | 2–1Stade Maurice Dufrasne, Liège | ![](image)Hungary | 4\n |\n| 1976 | ![](image) Yugoslavia | **![](image)Czechoslovakia** | **2–2** (a.e.t.)(5–3 p)Red Star Stadium, Belgrade | ![](image)West Germany | ![](image)Netherlands | 3–2 (a.e.t.)Stadion Maksimir, Zagreb | ![](image)Yugoslavia | 4\n |\n| 1980 | ![](image) Italy | **![](image)West Germany** | **2–1**Stadio Olimpico, Rome | ![](image)Belgium | ![](image)Czechoslovakia | 1–1 [a](9–8 p)Stadio San Paolo, Naples | ![](image)Italy | 8\n |\n| Losing semi-finalists[b] |\n| 1984 | ![](image) France | **![](image)France** | **2–0**Parc des Princes, Paris | ![](image)Spain | ![](image) Denmark and ![](image) Portugal | 8\n |\n| 1988 | ![](image) West Germany | **![](image)Netherlands** | **2–0**Olympiastadion, Munich | ![](image)Soviet Union | ![](image) Italy and ![](image) West Germany | 8\n |\n| 1992 | ![](image) Sweden | **![](image)Denmark** | **2–0**Ullevi, Gothenburg | ![](image)Germany | ![](image) Netherlands and ![](image) Sweden | 8\n |\n| 1996 | ![](image) England | **![](image)Germany** | **2–1** (g.g.)Wembley Stadium, London | ![](image)Czech Republic | ![](image) England and ![](image) France | 16\n |\n| 2000 | ![](image) Belgium![](image) Netherlands | **![](image)France** | **2–1** (g.g.)De Kuip, Rotterdam | ![](image)Italy | ![](image) Netherlands and ![](image) Portugal | 16\n |\n| 2004 | ![](image) Portugal | **![](image)Greece** | **1–0**Estádio da Luz, Lisbon | ![](image)Portugal | ![](image) Czech Republic and ![](image) Netherlands | 16\n |\n| 2008 | ![](image) Austria![](image)  Switzerland | **![](image)Spain** | **1–0**Ernst-Happel-Stadion, Vienna | ![](image)Germany | ![](image) Russia and ![](image) Turkey | 16\n |\n| 2012 | ![](image) Poland![](image) Ukraine | **![](image)Spain** | **4–0**Olimpiyskiy, Kyiv | ![](image)Italy | ![](image) Germany and ![](image) Portugal | 16\n |\n| 2016 | ![](image) France | **![](image)Portugal** | **1–0** (a.e.t.)

The competition is contested by UEFA members' senior men's national teams, determining the continental champion of Europe. It is the second-most watched football tournament in the world after the FIFA World Cup. The Euro 2012 final was watched by a global audience of around 300 million.[2] The competition has been held every four years since 1960, except for 2020, when it was postponed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, but kept the name Euro 2020. Scheduled to be in the even-numbered year between FIFA World Cup tournaments, it was originally called the **European Nations' Cup** before changing to its current name in 1968. Since 1996, the individual events have been branded as \"**UEFA Euro [year]**\".\n\n\nBefore entering the tournament, all teams other than the host nations (which qualify automatically) compete in a qualifying process. Until 2016, the championship winners could compete in the following year's FIFA Confederations Cup, but were not obliged to do so.[3] From the 2020 edition onwards, the winner competes in the CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions.\n\n\nThe sixteen European Championship tournaments have been won by ten national teams: Germany and Spain have each won three titles, Italy and France have won two titles, and the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, the Netherlands, Denmark, Greece and Portugal have won one title each. To date, Spain is the only team to have won consecutive titles, doing so in 2008 and 2012.\n\n\nThe most recent championship, held across Europe in 2021 (postponed from 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic), was won by Italy, who lifted their second European title after beating England in the final at Wembley Stadium in London on penalties.[4][5]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Beginnings[edit]\n\n\nRegional tournaments for national teams existed before the advent of a truly pan-European competition. Starting in 1883, the British Home Championship was an annual competition contested between the United Kingdom's four national teams, England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland. Until these national teams entered the FIFA World Cup in 1950, it was the most important international tournament these nations competed in. Similarly, from 1927 until 1960, the Central European International Cup was held six times. It brought together the national teams of Austria, Hungary, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, and Yugoslavia. The idea for a pan-European football tournament was first proposed by the French Football Federation's secretary-general Henri Delaunay in 1927, but it was not until 1958 that the tournament was started, three years after Delaunay's death.[6] In honour of Delaunay, the trophy awarded to the champions is named after him.[7] The 1960 tournament, held in France, had four teams competing in the finals out of 17 that entered the competition.[8] It was won by the Soviet Union, beating Yugoslavia 2–1 in a tense final in Paris.[9] Spain withdrew from its quarter-final match against the Soviet Union because of two political protests.[10] Of the 17 teams that entered the qualifying tournament, notable absentees were England, the Netherlands, West Germany and Italy.[11]\n\n\nSpain held the next tournament in 1964, which saw an increase in entries to the qualification tournament, with 29 entering;[12] West Germany was a notable absentee once again and Greece withdrew after being drawn against Albania, with whom they were still at war.[13] The hosts beat the title holders, the Soviet Union, 2–1 at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid.[14]\n\n\nThe tournament format stayed the same for the 1968 tournament, hosted and won by Italy.[15][16] For the first and only time, a match was decided on a coin toss (the semi-final between Italy and the Soviet Union)[17] and the final went to a replay, after the match against Yugoslavia finished 1–1.[18] Italy won the replay 2–0.[19] More teams entered this tournament (31), a testament to its burgeoning popularity.[20]\n\n\nBelgium hosted the 1972 tournament, which West Germany won, beating the Soviet Union 3–0 in the final, with goals coming from Gerd Müller (twice) and Herbert Wimmer at the Heysel Stadium in Brussels.[21] This tournament would provide a taste of things to come, as the German side contained many of the key members of the 1974 FIFA World Cup Champions.[22][23]\n\n\nThe 1976 tournament in Yugoslavia was the last in which only four teams took part in the final tournament, and the last in which the hosts had to qualify. Czechoslovakia beat West Germany in the newly introduced penalty shootout. After seven successful conversions, Uli Hoeneß missed, leaving Czechoslovakian Antonín Panenka with the opportunity to score and win the tournament. An \"audacious\" chipped shot,[24] described by UEFA as \"perhaps the most famous spot kick of all time\" secured the victory as Czechoslovakia won 5–3 on penalties.[25]\n\n\n\n### Expansion to 8 teams[edit]\n\n\nThe competition was expanded to eight teams in the 1980 tournament, again hosted by Italy. It involved a group stage, with the winners of the groups going on to contest the final, and the runners-up playing in the third place play-off.[26] West Germany won their second European title by beating Belgium 2–1, with two goals scored by Horst Hrubesch at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome.[27] Horst Hrubesch scored early in the first half before René Vandereycken equalised for Belgium with a penalty in the second half. With two minutes remaining, Hrubesch headed the winner for West Germany from a Karl-Heinz Rummenigge corner.[28]\n\n\nFrance won their first major title at home in the 1984 tournament, with their captain Michel Platini scoring 9 goals in just 5 games, including the opening goal in the final, in which they beat Spain 2–0.[29][30] The format also changed, with the top two teams in each group going through to a semi-final stage, instead of the winners of each group going straight into the final. The third place play-off was also abolished.[31]\n\n\n\n![](image)Ruud Gullit and the Netherlands team celebrating their victory in 1988\nWest Germany hosted UEFA Euro 1988, but lost 2–1 to the Netherlands, their traditional rivals, in the semi-finals, which sparked vigorous celebrations in the Netherlands.[32][33] The Netherlands went on to win the tournament in a rematch of their first game of the group stage, beating the Soviet Union 2–0 at the Olympia Stadion in Munich.[34] Marco van Basten scored the second goal, a volley over the keeper from the right wing which is often considered one of the best goals ever scored.[35]\n\n\nUEFA Euro 1992 was held in Sweden, and was won by Denmark, who were only in the finals after UN sanctions prevented Yugoslavia's participation as some of the states constituting the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia were at war with each other.[36][37] The Danes beat holders the Netherlands on penalties in the semi-finals,[38] then defeated world champion Germany 2–0.[39] This was the first tournament in which a unified Germany took part and also the first major tournament to have the players' names printed on their backs.\n\n\n\n### Expansion to 16 teams[edit]\n\n\nEngland hosted UEFA Euro 1996, the first tournament to use the nomenclature \"Euro [year]\" and would see the number of teams taking part double to 16.[40] The hosts, in a replay of the 1990 FIFA World Cup semi-final, were knocked out on penalties by Germany.[41] The surprise team of the tournament was the newly formed Czech Republic, participating on its first international competition following the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, which reached the final after beating Portugal and France in the knockout stage. Germany would go on to win the Final 2–1 thanks to the first golden goal ever in a major tournament, scored by Oliver Bierhoff five minutes into extra time.[42][43] This was Germany's first title as a unified nation.\n\n\nUEFA Euro 2000 was the first tournament to be held by two countries, in the Netherlands and Belgium.[44] France, the reigning World Cup champions, were favoured to win, and they lived up to expectations when they beat Italy 2–1 after extra time, having come from being 1–0 down: Sylvain Wiltord equalised in the last minute of regular time and David Trezeguet scored the winning golden goal in extra time.[45]\n\n\n\n![](image)The UEFA Euro 2004 opening ceremony in Portugal.\nUEFA Euro 2004, like 1992, produced an upset: Greece, who had only qualified for one World Cup (1994) and one European Championship (1980) before, beat hosts Portugal 1–0 in the final (after having also beaten them in the opening game) with a goal scored by Angelos Charisteas in the 57th minute to win a tournament that they had been given odds of 150–1 to win before it began[46] (being the second least likely team to have any success after Latvia)[*citation needed*]. On their way to the Final, they also beat holders France[47] as well as the Czech Republic with a silver goal,[48][49] a rule which replaced the previous golden goal in 2003, before being abolished itself shortly after this tournament.\n\n\nThe 2008 tournament, hosted by Austria and Switzerland, marked the second time that two nations co-hosted and the first edition where the new trophy was awarded.[50] It commenced on 7 June and finished on 29 June.[51] The Final between Germany and Spain was held at the Ernst Happel Stadion in Vienna.[52] Spain defeated Germany 1–0, with a goal scored by Fernando Torres in the 33rd minute, sparking much celebration across the country.[53] This was their first title since the 1964 tournament. Spain were the highest scoring team with 12 goals scored and David Villa finished as the top scorer with four goals. Xavi was awarded the player of the tournament, and nine Spanish players were picked for the team of the tournament.\n\n\nThe UEFA Euro 2012 tournament was co-hosted by Poland and Ukraine.[54] Spain defeated Italy 4–0 in the Final, thus becoming the first nation to defend a European Championship title, as well as the first European team to win three consecutive major tournaments.[55] In scoring the third goal of the final, Torres became the first player to score in two European Championship finals. He was equal top scorer for the tournament with three goals in total, along with Mario Balotelli, Alan Dzagoev, Mario Gómez, Mario Mandžukić, and Cristiano Ronaldo, despite only being used as a substitute player. The tournament was otherwise notable for having the most headed goals in a Euro tournament (26 out of 76 goals in total); a disallowed goal in the England versus Ukraine group game which replays showed had crossed the goal line, and which prompted President of FIFA Sepp Blatter to tweet, \"GLT (Goal-line technology) is no longer an alternative but a necessity\",[56] thus reversing his long-held reluctance to embrace such technology; and some crowd violence in group games.\n\n\n\n### Expansion to 24 teams[edit]\n\n\nIn 2007, the Football Association of Ireland and Scottish Football Association proposed the expansion of the tournament, which was later confirmed by the UEFA Executive Committee in September 2008.[57][58] Out of the 54 member associations of UEFA, only three, including England and Germany, opposed the expansion.[59] On 28 May 2010, UEFA announced that UEFA Euro 2016 would be hosted by France. France beat bids of Turkey (7–6 in voting in the second voting round) and Italy, which had the fewest votes in the first voting round.[60] Euro 2016 was the first to have 24 teams in the finals.[61] This was the third time France have hosted the competition. Portugal, which qualified for the knock-out phase despite finishing third in its group, went on to win the championship by defeating heavily favoured host team France 1–0 in the Final, thanks to a goal from Eder in the 109th minute. Cristiano Ronaldo, Portugal's world-renowned striker, came out of the game due to injury in the 25th minute. This was the first time Portugal won a major tournament.\n\n\nFor the 2020 tournament, three bids were proposed, including a bid from Turkey,[62] a joint bid from the Republic of Ireland, Scotland and Wales,[63] and a joint bid from Georgia and Azerbaijan.[64] In December 2012, however, UEFA announced that the 2020 tournament would be hosted in several cities in various countries across Europe, with the semi-finals and Final being played in London.[65][66] The venues were selected and announced by UEFA on 19 September 2014.[67] However, Brussels was removed as a host city on 7 December 2017 due to delays with the building of the Eurostadium.[68] On 17 March 2020, UEFA announced that Euro 2020 would be delayed by a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, and proposed it take place from 11 June to 11 July 2021. The competition was postponed in order to reduce pressure on the public services in affected countries and to provide space in the calendar for the completion of domestic leagues that had been suspended.[69] Before the Euro 2020, Dublin was also removed as one of the host cities due to its inability to guarantee spectators to the stadium, while Bilbao was replaced by Seville for the same reason.[70][71] In the Final, Italy defeated maiden finalists England 3–2 on penalties, after the game was tied 1–1 after extra time, to win their second European Championship.[72]\n\n\n\n## Trophy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The trophy on display in 2021\nThe Henri Delaunay Trophy, which is awarded to the winner of the European Championship, is named in honour of Henri Delaunay, the first General Secretary of UEFA, who came up with the idea of a European championship but died five years before the first tournament in 1960. His son Pierre was in charge of creating the trophy.[73] Since the first tournament it has been awarded to the winning team for them to keep for four years, until the next tournament. This trophy bore the words *Coupe d'Europe* (\"European Cup\"), *Coupe Henri Delaunay* (\"Henri Delaunay Cup\"), and *Championnat d'Europe* (\"European Championship\") on the front and a juggling boy on the back.\n\n\nFor the 2008 tournament, the Henri Delaunay Trophy was remodelled to make it larger, as the old trophy was overshadowed by UEFA's other trophies such as the new European Champion Clubs' Cup. The new trophy, which is made of sterling silver, now weighs 8 kilograms (18 lb) and is 60 centimetres (24 in) tall, being 2 kilograms (4.4 lb) heavier and 18 centimetres (7.1 in) longer than the old one. The marble plinth that was serving as base was removed. The new silver base of the trophy had to be enlarged to make it stable. The names of the winning countries that had appeared on the plaques glued to the plinth are now engraved on the back of the trophy,[74] under the word *Coupe Henri Delaunay* and are written in English rather than French its predecessor had. The 1972 and 1980 winning country, West Germany, is written as just *Germany*.[*citation needed*] Since 2016, the juggling boy was returned on the trophy's back.\n\n\nThe players and coaches of the winning team and the runner-up team are awarded gold and silver medals, respectively. Each association that competes in the final tournament receives a commemorative plaque. Each time the team losing semi-finalist, as well as each finalist, receive a dedicated plaque. Though there is no longer a third place play-off, UEFA decided in the 2008 edition to award the semi-final losers (Turkey and Russia) bronze medals for the first time,[75] and did the same in the 2012 edition when Germany and Portugal received bronze medals.[76] However, UEFA decided that losing semi-finalists would no longer receive medals from the 2016 edition onwards.[77] Bronze medals were previously awarded for winners of the third place play-off, the last of which was held in 1980.\n\n\n\n## Format[edit]\n\n\n### The competition[edit]\n\n\nBefore 1980, only four teams qualified for the final tournament. From 1980, eight teams competed. In 1996 the tournament expanded to 16 teams, since it was easier for European nations to qualify for the World Cup than their own continental championship; 14 of the 24 teams at the 1982, 1986 and 1990 World Cups had been European, whereas the European Championship finals still involved only eight teams.\n\n\nIn 2007, there was much discussion about an expansion of the tournament to 24 teams, started by Scotland and the Republic of Ireland, due to the increased number of football associations in Europe after the break-ups of Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, and the inclusion of Israel and Kazakhstan. The new president of UEFA, Michel Platini, was reported to be in favour of expansion which proved an accurate assumption. Whilst on 17 April 2007, UEFA's executive committee formally decided against expansion in 2012, Platini indicated in June 2008 that UEFA will increase participation from 16 to 24 teams in future tournaments, starting from 2016.[78] On 25 September, it was announced by Franz Beckenbauer that an agreement had been reached, and the expansion to 24 teams would be officially announced the next day.[79]\n\n\nThe competing teams are chosen by a series of qualifying games: in 1960 and 1964 through home and away play-offs; from 1968 through a combination of both qualifying groups and play-off games. The host country was selected from the four finalists after they were determined through qualifying.\n\n\nSince the expansion of the final tournament starting from 1980, the host country, or countries, have been chosen beforehand and qualify automatically.\n\n\nIn most tournaments, the tournament consists of a round-robin group stage followed by a single-elimination knockout stage.\n\n\n\n\n\n| No.\n | Year\n | Host\n | Teams\n | Matches\n | Round 1\n | Final stages\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 1960 | ![](image) France | 4\n | 4\n | knockout: 4 matches (not counting replays)\n |\n| 2\n | 1964 | ![](image) Spain |\n| 3\n | 1968 | ![](image) Italy | 5\n |\n| 4\n | 1972 | ![](image) Belgium | 4\n | knockout: 4 matches\n |\n| 5\n | 1976 | ![](image) Yugoslavia |\n| 6\n | 1980 | ![](image) Italy | 8\n | 14\n | 2 groups of 4 teams: 12 matches\n | final (round 1 group winners) and third-place match (round 1 group runners-up)\n |\n| 7\n | 1984 | ![](image) France | 15\n | knockout of 4 teams (round 1 group winners and runners-up): 3 matches\n |\n| 8\n | 1988 | ![](image) West Germany |\n| 9\n | 1992 | ![](image) Sweden |\n| 10\n | 1996 | ![](image) England | 16\n | 31\n | 4 groups of 4 teams: 24 matches\n | knockout of 8 teams (round 1 group winners and runners-up): 7 matches\n |\n| 11\n | 2000 | ![](image) Belgium![](image) Netherlands |\n| 12\n | 2004 | ![](image) Portugal |\n| 13\n | 2008 | ![](image) Austria![](image)  Switzerland |\n| 14\n | 2012 | ![](image) Poland![](image) Ukraine |\n| 15\n | 2016 | ![](image) France | 24\n | 51\n | 6 groups of 4 teams: 36 matches\n | knockout of 16 teams (round 1 group winners and runners-up, plus four best third-placed teams): 15 matches\n |\n| 16\n | 2020[s 1] | ![](image) Europe[s 2] |\n| *17* | *2024* | *![](image) Germany* |\n| *18* | *2028* | *![](image) England![](image) Northern Ireland![](image) Republic of Ireland![](image) Scotland![](image) Wales* |\n| *19* | *2032* | *![](image) Italy![](image) Turkey* |\n\n\n1. **^** Postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe\n2. **^** Pan–European edition hosted by eleven countries: Azerbaijan, Denmark, England, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Romania, Russia, Scotland and Spain\n\nUp to 1968 draws were to be broken via a coin toss in all matches but the final, draw in final match was resolved via a replay.\n\n\nNo third place play-off has been played since 1980.\n\n\n\n### Qualifying[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA European Championship qualifying\n\nTo qualify, a team must finish in one of the qualifying spots or win a play-off. After this, a team proceeds to the finals round in the host country, although hosts qualify for the tournament automatically. The qualifying phase begins in the autumn after the preceding FIFA World Cup, almost two years before the finals.\n\n\nThe groups for qualification are drawn by a UEFA committee using seeding. Seeded teams include reigning champions and other teams based on their performance in the preceding FIFA World Cup qualifying and the last European Championship qualifying. To obtain an accurate view of the teams' abilities, a ranking is produced. This is calculated by taking the total number of points won by a particular team and dividing it by the number of games played, i.e. points per game. In the case of a team having hosted one of the two previous competitions and therefore having qualified automatically, only the results from the single most recent qualifying competition are used. If two teams have equal points per game, the committee then bases their positions in the rankings on:\n\n\n\n1. Coefficient from the matches played in its most recent qualifying competition.\n2. Average goal difference.\n3. Average number of goals scored.\n4. Average number of away goals scored.\n5. Drawing of lots.\n\n\nThe qualifying phase is played in a group format, the composition of the groups is determined through means of a draw of teams from pre-defined seeded bowls. The draw takes place after the preceding World Cup's qualifying competition. For UEFA Euro 2020, the group qualifying phase consisted of ten groups; five of six teams and the remainder of five teams each.\n\n\nEach group is played in a league format with teams playing each other home and away. The top two teams then qualified for the final tournament, with remaining places decided by playoffs depending on their ranking in the UEFA Nations League. As with most leagues, the points are awarded as three for a win, one for a draw, and none for a loss. In the eventuality of one or more teams having equal points after all matches have been played, the following criteria are used to distinguish the sides:\n\n\n\n1. Higher number of points obtained in the group matches played among the teams in question.\n2. Superior goal difference from the group matches played among the teams in question.\n3. Higher number of goals scored in the group matches played among the teams in question.\n4. Higher number of goals scored away from home in the group matches played among the teams in question.\n5. Results of all group matches:\n\t1. Superior goal difference\n\t2. Higher number of goals scored\n\t3. Higher number of goals scored away from home\n\t4. Fair play conduct.\n6. Drawing of lots.\n\n\n### Final tournament[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of countries' best results. 10 countries have won, counting Germany and West Germany as one\nSixteen teams progressed to the final tournament for the 2012 tournament. They were joint hosts Poland and Ukraine, the winners and the highest ranked second-placed team from the nine qualifying groups as well as the winners of four play-off matches between the runners-up of the other groups. These sixteen teams were divided equally into four groups, A, B, C and D, each consisting of four teams. The groups were drawn up by the UEFA administration, again using seeding. The seeded teams being the host nations, the reigning champions, should they qualify, and those with the best points per game coefficients over the qualifying phase of the tournament and the previous World Cup qualifying. Other finalists were assigned to by means of a draw, using coefficients as a basis.\n\n\nFor the 2016 tournament, the expansion to 24 teams means that the teams will be drawn into six groups of four, with the six group winners, six group runners-up and the four best third-placed teams advancing to the round of 16 when it becomes a knockout competition.[77]\n\n\nThe groups are again played in a league format, where a team plays its opponents once each. The same points system is used (three points for a win, one point for a draw, no points for a defeat). A schedule for the group matches will be drawn up, but the last two matches in a group must kick off simultaneously. The winner and runner-up of each group progress to the next round, where a knockout system is used (the two teams play each other once, the winner progresses), this is used in all subsequent rounds as well. The winners of the quarter-finals matches progress to the semi-finals, where the winners play in the final. If in any of the knockout rounds, the scores are still equal after normal playing time, extra time and penalties are employed to separate the two teams. Unlike the FIFA World Cup, this tournament no longer has a third place playoff.\n\n\n\n## Results[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of UEFA European Championship finals\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Year\n | Host\n |  | Final\n |  | Third place playoff\n |  | Number of teams\n |\n| Winners\n | Score and venue\n | Runners-up\n | Third place\n | Score and venue\n | Fourth place\n |\n| 1960 | ![](image) France | **![](image)Soviet Union** | **2–1** (a.e.t.)Parc des Princes, Paris | ![](image)Yugoslavia | ![](image)Czechoslovakia | 2–0 Stade Vélodrome, Marseille | ![](image)France | 4\n |\n| 1964 | ![](image) Spain | **![](image)Spain** | **2–1**Santiago Bernabéu, Madrid | ![](image)Soviet Union | ![](image)Hungary | 3–1 (a.e.t.)Camp Nou, Barcelona | ![](image)Denmark | 4\n |\n| 1968 | ![](image) Italy | **![](image)Italy** | **1–1** (a.e.t.)**2–0** (replay)Stadio Olimpico, Rome | ![](image)Yugoslavia | ![](image)England | 2–0 Stadio Olimpico, Rome | ![](image)Soviet Union | 4\n |\n| 1972 | ![](image) Belgium | **![](image)West Germany** | **3–0**Heysel Stadium, Brussels | ![](image)Soviet Union | ![](image)Belgium | 2–1Stade Maurice Dufrasne, Liège | ![](image)Hungary | 4\n |\n| 1976 | ![](image) Yugoslavia | **![](image)Czechoslovakia** | **2–2** (a.e.t.)(5–3 p)Red Star Stadium, Belgrade | ![](image)West Germany | ![](image)Netherlands | 3–2 (a.e.t.)Stadion Maksimir, Zagreb | ![](image)Yugoslavia | 4\n |\n| 1980 | ![](image) Italy | **![](image)West Germany** | **2–1**Stadio Olimpico, Rome | ![](image)Belgium | ![](image)Czechoslovakia | 1–1 [a](9–8 p)Stadio San Paolo, Naples | ![](image)Italy | 8\n |\n| Losing semi-finalists[b] |\n| 1984 | ![](image) France | **![](image)France** | **2–0**Parc des Princes, Paris | ![](image)Spain | ![](image) Denmark and ![](image) Portugal | 8\n |\n| 1988 | ![](image) West Germany | **![](image)Netherlands** | **2–0**Olympiastadion, Munich | ![](image)Soviet Union | ![](image) Italy and ![](image) West Germany | 8\n |\n| 1992 | ![](image) Sweden | **![](image)Denmark** | **2–0**Ullevi, Gothenburg | ![](image)Germany | ![](image) Netherlands and ![](image) Sweden | 8\n |\n| 1996 | ![](image) England | **![](image)Germany** | **2–1** (g.g.)Wembley Stadium, London | ![](image)Czech Republic | ![](image) England and ![](image) France | 16\n |\n| 2000 | ![](image) Belgium![](image) Netherlands | **![](image)France** | **2–1** (g.g.)De Kuip, Rotterdam | ![](image)Italy | ![](image) Netherlands and ![](image) Portugal | 16\n |\n| 2004 | ![](image) Portugal | **![](image)Greece** | **1–0**Estádio da Luz, Lisbon | ![](image)Portugal | ![](image) Czech Republic and ![](image) Netherlands | 16\n |\n| 2008 | ![](image) Austria![](image)  Switzerland | **![](image)Spain** | **1–0**Ernst-Happel-Stadion, Vienna | ![](image)Germany | ![](image) Russia and ![](image) Turkey | 16\n |\n| 2012 | ![](image) Poland![](image) Ukraine | **![](image)Spain** | **4–0**Olimpiyskiy, Kyiv | ![](image)Italy | ![](image) Germany and ![](image) Portugal | 16\n |\n| 2016 | ![](image) France | **![](image)Portugal** | **1–0** (a.e.t.)

The latter two were absorbed along with their records;[13][14] the present team represents the reunified Federal Republic. The official name and code \"Germany FR (FRG)\" was shortened to \"Germany (GER)\" following reunification in 1990.\n\n\nGermany is one of the most successful national teams in international competitions, having won four World Cups (1954, 1974, 1990, 2014), tied with Italy, and only one less than the most successful team, Brazil. Having won three European Championships (1972, 1980, 1996) Germany is along with Spain the record holder in that international competition. Germany won also a Confederations Cup (2017).[11] They have also been runners-up at the European Championship three times, and four times at the World Cup, with a further four third-place finishes at the World Cup.[11] East Germany won Olympic Gold in 1976.[15] Germany is one of only two nations to have won both the FIFA World Cup and the FIFA Women's World Cup (the other being Spain).[16][17] By combined World Cups, Germany stands as the most successful football nation in history with six World Cups – four for the men's team and two for the women's. At the end of the 2014 World Cup, Germany earned the second highest Elo rating of any national football team in history, with 2,223 points.[18] Germany is also the only European nation that has won a FIFA World Cup in the Americas.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the Germany national football team\n\n### Early years (1899–1942)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Germany national team at its first official international match in 1908\nOn 18 April 1897, an early international game on German soil was played in Hamburg when a selection team from the Danish Football Association defeated a selection team from the Hamburg-Altona Football Association, 5–0.[19][20]\n\n\nBetween 1899 and 1901, prior to the formation of a national team, there were five international matches between Germany and English selection teams, which are today not recognised as official by either nation's football association (in part because England fielded their amateur side, which was an overflow or B team). All five matches ended in large defeats for the Germany teams, including a 12–0 loss at White Hart Lane in September 1901.[21] Eight years after the establishment of the German Football Association (DFB) in 1900, the first official match of the Germany national football team[d] was played on 5 April 1908, against Switzerland in Basel, with the Swiss winning 5–3.[7] A follow-up to the earlier series between England Amateurs and Germany occurred in March 1909 at Oxford's White House Ground[22] and resulted in Germany's largest official defeat to date: 9–0 (this time, the match was recognised and recorded as official by the DFB but not by the FA, again due to the amateur side being fielded).[21] These early confrontations formed the beginning of the rich rivalry between the two teams: one of the longest and most enduring international rivalries in football.[23]\n\n\nJulius Hirsch was the first Jewish player to represent the Germany national football team, which he joined in 1911.[24][25] Hirsch scored four goals for Germany against the Netherlands in 1912, becoming the first German to score four goals in a single match.[26][27]\n\n\n\n![](image)Gottfried Fuchs\nGottfried Fuchs scored a world record 10 goals for Germany in a 16–0 win against Russia at the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm on 1 July, becoming the top scorer of the tournament; his international record was not surpassed until 2001 when Australia's Archie Thompson scored 13 goals in a 31–0 defeat of American Samoa.[28] He was Jewish, and the German Football Association erased all references to him from their records between 1933 and 1945.[29][30] As of 2016, he was still the top German scorer for one match.[31]\n\n\nAt that time the players were selected by the DFB, as there was no dedicated coach. The first manager of the Germany national team was Otto Nerz, a school teacher from Mannheim, who served in the role from 1926 to 1936.[32] The German FA could not afford travel to Uruguay for the first World Cup staged in 1930 during the Great Depression, but finished third in the 1934 World Cup in their first appearance in the competition. After a poor showing at the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin, Sepp Herberger became coach. In 1937 he put together a squad which was soon nicknamed the *Breslau Elf* (the Breslau Eleven) in recognition of their 8–0 win over Denmark in the then German city of Breslau, Lower Silesia (now Wrocław, Poland).[33][34]\n\n\nAfter Austria became part of Germany in the *Anschluss* of March 1938, the Austrian national team – one of Europe's best sides at the time due to professionalism – was disbanded despite having already qualified for the 1938 World Cup. Nazi politicians ordered five or six ex-Austrian players, from the clubs Rapid Vienna, Austria Vienna, and First Vienna FC, to join the \"all-German\" team on short notice in a staged show of unity for political reasons. At the 1938 World Cup in France, this \"united\" Germany national team managed only a 1–1 draw against Switzerland and then lost the replay 2–4 in front of a hostile crowd in Paris. That early exit stands as Germany's worst World Cup result, and one of just three occasions the team failed to progress from the group stage – the next would not occur until the 2018 tournament, and it would be repeated in 2022.\n\n\nDuring World War II, the team played over 30 international games between September 1939 and November 1942. National team games were then suspended, as most players had to join the armed forces. Many of the national team players were gathered together under coach Herberger as *Rote Jäger* through the efforts of a sympathetic air force officer trying to protect the footballers from the most dangerous wartime service.\n\n\n\n### Three Germany national teams (1945–1990)[edit]\n\n\nAfter World War II, Germany was banned from competition in most sports until 1950. The DFB was not a full member of FIFA, and none of the three new German states – West Germany, East Germany, and Saarland – entered the 1950 World Cup qualifiers.\n\n\nThe Federal Republic of Germany, which was referred to as West Germany, continued the DFB. With recognition by FIFA and UEFA, the DFB maintained and continued the record of the pre-war team. Switzerland was the first team that played West Germany in 1950,[35] with the latter qualifying for the 1954 World Cup and the former hosting it.\n\n\nThe Saarland, a French protectorate between 1947 and 1956, did not join French organisations, and was barred from participating in pan-German ones. It sent their own team to the 1952 Summer Olympics and to the 1954 World Cup qualifiers. In 1957, Saarland acceded to the Federal Republic of Germany.\n\n\nIn 1949, the communist German Democratic Republic (East Germany) was founded. In 1952 the *Deutscher Fußball-Verband der DDR* (DFV) was established and the East Germany national football team took to the field. They were the only team to beat the 1974 FIFA World Cup winning West Germans in the only meeting of the two sides of the divided nation. East Germany won the gold medal at the 1976 Olympics. After German reunification in 1990, the eastern football competition was reintegrated into the DFB.\n\n\n\n### 1954 World Cup victory[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1954 FIFA World Cup final\n\n![](image)Helmut Rahn scored the winning goal in the 1954 FIFA World Cup final.\nWest Germany, captained by Fritz Walter, met in the 1954 World Cup against Turkey, Yugoslavia and Austria. When playing favourites Hungary in the group stage, West Germany lost 3–8, and faced the Hungarian \"Mighty Magyars\" again in the final. Hungary had gone unbeaten for 32 consecutive matches, and West Germany snapped the streak by winning 3–2, with Helmut Rahn scoring the winning goal.[36] The success is called \"The Miracle of Bern\" (*Das Wunder von Bern*).[37]\n\n\n\n### Memorable losses: Wembley goal and game of the century (1958–1970)[edit]\n\n\nAfter finishing fourth in the 1958 World Cup and reaching only the quarter-finals in the 1962 World Cup, the DFB made changes. Professionalism was introduced, and the best clubs from the various Regionalligas were assembled into the new Bundesliga. In 1964, Helmut Schön took over as coach, replacing Herberger who had been in office for 28 years.\n\n\nIn the 1966 World Cup, West Germany reached the final after beating the USSR in the semi-final, facing hosts England. In extra time, the first goal by Geoff Hurst was one of the most contentious goals in the history of the World Cup: the linesman signalled the ball had crossed the line for a goal, after bouncing down from the crossbar, when replays showed it did not appear to have fully crossed the line. Hurst then scored another goal giving England a 4–2 win.[38][39]\n\n\nWest Germany in the 1970 World Cup knocked England out in the quarter-finals 3–2, before they suffered a 4–3 extra-time loss in the semi-final against Italy. This match with five goals in extra time is one of the most dramatic in World Cup history, and is called the \"Game of the Century\" in both Italy and Germany.[40][41] West Germany claimed third by beating Uruguay 1–0. Gerd Müller finished as the tournament's top scorer with 10 goals.\n\n\n\n### 1974 World Cup title on home soil[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1974 FIFA World Cup\n\n![](image)The 1974 FIFA World Cup Final on 7 July, in Munich's Olympiastadion\nIn 1971, Franz Beckenbauer became captain of the national team, and he led West Germany to victory at the European Championship at Euro 1972, defeating the Soviet Union 3–0 in the final.[42][43]\n\n\nAs hosts of the 1974 World Cup, they won their second World Cup, defeating the Netherlands 2–1 in the final in Munich.[44]\nTwo matches in the 1974 World Cup stood out for West Germany. The first group stage saw a politically charged match as West Germany played a game against East Germany. The East Germans won 1–0 but it made a scant difference to West Germany as the West Germans advanced to the knockout stage.[45] The West Germans advanced to the final against the Johan Cruijff-led Dutch team and their brand of \"Total Football\". The Dutch took the lead from a penalty. However, West Germany tied the match on a penalty by Paul Breitner, and won it with Gerd Müller's fine finish soon after.[46][47]\n\n\n\n### Late 1970s and early 1980s[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gerd Müller in 1974\nWest Germany failed to defend their titles in the next two major international tournaments. They lost to Czechoslovakia in the UEFA Euro 1976 final in a penalty shootout 5–3,[48] their last penalty shootout loss in a major tournament as of 2022.[49]\n\n\nIn the 1978 World Cup, Germany was eliminated in the second group stage after losing 3–2 to Austria. Schön retired as coach afterward, and the post was taken over by his assistant, Jupp Derwall.\n\n\nWest Germany's first tournament under Derwall was successful, as they earned their second European title at Euro 1980 after defeating Belgium 2–1 in the final.[50] West Germany started the 1982 World Cup with a 1–2 upset by newcomers Algeria in their first match,[51] but advanced to the second round with a controversial 1–0 win over Austria. In the semi-final against France, they tied the match 3–3 and won the penalty shootout 5–4.[52][53] In the final, they were defeated by Italy 1–3.[54]\n\n\nDuring this period, West Germany's Gerd Müller racked up fourteen goals in two World Cups (1970 and 1974). His ten goals in 1970 are the third-most ever in a tournament. Müller's all-time World Cup record of 14 goals was broken by Ronaldo in 2006; this was then further broken by Miroslav Klose in 2014 with 16 goals.[55]\n\n\n\n### Beckenbauer's managing success (1984–1990)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Franz Beckenbauer in 1990\nAfter West Germany were eliminated in the first round of Euro 1984, Franz Beckenbauer returned to the national team to replace Derwall as manager.[56] At the 1986 World Cup in Mexico, West Germany finished as runners-up for the second consecutive tournament after beating France 2–0 in the semi-finals, but losing to the Diego Maradona-led Argentina in the final, 2–3.[57][58] In Euro 1988, after drawing Italy 1–1 and beating both Denmark and Spain 2–0 in the group stage,[59] West Germany's hopes of winning the tournament on home soil were spoiled by the Netherlands, as the Dutch beat them 2–1 in the semi-finals.[60][61]\n\n\nAt the 1990 World Cup in Italy, West Germany won their third World Cup title, in its unprecedented third consecutive final appearance.[62] Captained by Lothar Matthäus, they defeated Yugoslavia (4–1), UAE (5–1), the Netherlands (2–1), Czechoslovakia (1–0), and England (1–1, 4–3 on penalty kicks) on the way to a final rematch against Argentina in Rome.[63][64] West Germany won 1–0, with the only goal being a penalty scored in the 85th minute by Andreas Brehme.[62] Beckenbauer, who won the World Cup as the national team's captain in 1974, thus became the first person to win the World Cup as both captain and manager,[56] and the second to win as player and manager, after Mario Zagallo of Brazil.\n\n\n\n### Olympic football[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Germany Olympic football team\n\n\n\n| Medal record\n |\n| --- |\n| Summer Olympic Games |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) | 1976 Montreal | Team |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) | 1980 Moscow | Team |\n| ![Bronze medal – third place](image) | 1964 Tokyo | Team |\n| ![Bronze medal – third place](image) | 1972 Munich | Team |\n| ![Bronze medal – third place](image) | 1988 Seoul | Team |\n\n\nEast Germany did however achieve significantly greater success in Olympic football than the amateur teams fielded by the Western NOC of Germany due to using its elite players from the top domestic league. In 1956, 1960, and 1964 both states had sent a United Team of Germany. For 1964, the East German side had beaten their Western counterparts in order to be selected. They went on to win the bronze medal for Germany. As GDR, they won bronze in 1972 in Munich, gold in 1976 in Montreal, and silver in 1980 in Moscow.\n\n\nPrior to 1984, Olympic football was an amateur event, meaning that only non-professional players could participate.[e] Due to this, West Germany was never able to achieve the same degree of success at the Olympics as at the World Cup. The first medal coming in the 1988 Olympics, when they won the bronze medal after beating Italy 3–0 in the 3rd place match.[65] West Germany also reached the second round in both 1972 and 1984. On the other hand, due to having an ability to field its top-level players who were classified as amateurs on a technicality East Germany did better, winning a gold, a silver and two bronze medals (one representing the United Team of Germany).\n\n\n\n### Berti Vogts years (1990–1998)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Berti Vogts\nIn February 1990, months after the fall of the Berlin Wall, East Germany and West Germany were drawn together in UEFA Euro 1992 qualifying Group 5. In November 1990, the East German association Deutscher Fußball-Verband integrated into the DFB, by which time the East Germany team had ceased operations, playing its last match on 12 September 1990. The unified Germany national team completed the European Championship qualifying group. The East German 1990–91 league continued, with a restructuring of German leagues in 1991–92. The first game with a unified Germany national team was against Switzerland on 19 December.[66]\n\n\nAfter the 1990 World Cup, assistant Berti Vogts took over as the national team coach from the retiring Beckenbauer. In Euro 1992, Germany reached the final, but lost 0–2 to underdogs Denmark.[67]\nIn the 1994 World Cup, they were upset 1–2 in the quarterfinals by Bulgaria.[68][69]\n\n\nReunified Germany won its first major international title at Euro 1996, becoming European champions for the third time.[70] They defeated hosts England in the semi-finals,[71] and the Czech Republic 2–1 in the final on a golden goal in extra time.[72]\n\n\nHowever, in the 1998 World Cup, Germany were eliminated in the quarterfinals in a 0–3 defeat to Croatia, all goals being scored after defender Christian Wörns received a straight red card.[73] Vogts stepped down afterwards and was replaced by Erich Ribbeck.[74]\n\n\n\n### Erich Ribbeck and Rudi Völler years (2000–2004)[edit]\n\n\nIn Euro 2000, the team went out in the first round, drawing with Romania, then suffering a 1–0 defeat to England and were routed 3–0 by Portugal (which fielded their backup players, having already advanced).[75] Ribbeck resigned, and was replaced by Rudi Völler.[76]\n\n\nComing into the 2002 World Cup, expectations of Germany were low due to poor results in the qualifiers, and not directly qualifying for the finals for the first time. The team advanced through group play, and in the knockout stages they produced three consecutive 1–0 wins against Paraguay,[77] the United States,[78] and co-hosts South Korea. Oliver Neuville scored two minutes from time against Paraguay and Michael Ballack scored both goals in the US and South Korea games, although he picked up a second yellow card against South Korea for a tactical foul and was suspended for the subsequent match.[79] This set up a final against Brazil, the first World Cup meeting between the two. Germany lost 0–2 thanks to two Ronaldo goals.[80] Nevertheless, German captain and goalkeeper Oliver Kahn won the Golden Ball,[81] the first time in the World Cup that a goalkeeper was named the best player of the tournament.[82]\n\n\n\n![](image)Fans watching Germany play against Argentina in the 2006 World Cup match at the Donau Arena in Regensburg\nGermany again exited in the first round of Euro 2004, drawing their first two matches and losing the third to the Czech Republic (who had fielded a second-string team).[83] Völler resigned afterwards, and Jürgen Klinsmann was appointed head coach.[84][85]\n\n\n\n### Resurgence under Klinsmann (2004–2006)[edit]\n\n\nKlinsmann's main task was to lead the national team to a good showing at the 2006 World Cup in Germany. He relieved goalkeeper Kahn of the captaincy and announced that Kahn and longtime backup Jens Lehmann would be competing for the position of starting goaltender, a decision that angered Kahn and Lehmann eventually won that contest.[86] Expectations for the team were low, which was not helped by veteran defender Christian Wörns being dropped (after Wörns criticised Klinsmann for designating him only as a backup player on the squad), a choice roundly panned in Germany. Italy routed Germany 4–1 in a March 2006 exhibition game, and Klinsmann bore the brunt of the criticism as the team was ranked only 22nd in the world entering the 2006 World Cup.[87]\n\n\nAs World Cup hosts, Germany won all three group stage matches to finish top of their group. The team defeated Sweden 2–0 in the round of 16,[88]\nand Argentina in the quarter-finals in a penalty shootout.[89][90][91] The semi-final against Italy was scoreless until near the end of extra time when Germany conceded two goals.[92]\nIn the third place match, Germany defeated Portugal 3–1.[93]\nMiroslav Klose was awarded the Golden Boot for his tournament-leading five goals.[94]\n\n\n\n### Löw era (2006–2021)[edit]\n\n\n#### Euro 2008, 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: UEFA Euro 2008, 2010 FIFA World Cup, and UEFA Euro 2012\n\nGermany's entry into the Euro 2008 qualifying round was marked by the promotion of Joachim Löw to head coach, since Klinsmann resigned.[95]\nAt UEFA Euro 2008, Germany won two out of three matches in group play to advance to the knockout round.[96]\nThey defeated Portugal 3–2 in the quarterfinal,[97]\nand won their semi-final against Turkey.[98]\nGermany lost the final against Spain 0–1, finishing as the runners-up.[99]\n\n\nIn the 2010 World Cup, Germany won the group and advanced to the knockout stage. In the round of 16, Germany defeated England 4–1.[100] The game controversially had a valid goal by Frank Lampard disallowed.[101][102][103] In the quarter-finals, Germany defeated Argentina 4–0,[104] and Miroslav Klose tied German Gerd Müller's record of 14 World Cup goals.[105]\nIn the semi-final, Germany lost 1–0 to Spain.[106] Germany defeated Uruguay 3–2 to take third place (their second third place after 2006).[107] German Thomas Müller won the Golden Boot and the Best Young Player Award.[108][109]\n\n\n\n![](image)Germany during Euro 2012 qualifiers\nIn Euro 2012, Germany was placed in group B along with Portugal, Netherlands, and Denmark. Germany won all three group matches. Germany defeated Greece in the quarter-final and set a record of 15 consecutive wins in all competitive matches.[110] In the semi-finals, Germany lost to Italy, 1–2.\n\n\n\n#### 2014 World Cup victory[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 FIFA World Cup\n\n![](image)Germany lifting the World Cup trophy in 2014\nGermany were placed in Group G of the 2014 World Cup,[111] with Portugal, Ghana, and the United States. They first faced Portugal in a match billed by some as the \"team of all the talents against the team of The Talent (Cristiano Ronaldo)\", routing the Portuguese 4–0 thanks to a hat-trick by Thomas Müller.[112][113] In their match with Ghana, they led the game with Götze's second half goal, but then conceded two consecutive goals. Klose scored a goal to level Germany 2–2, his 15th World Cup goal to join former Brazil striker Ronaldo at the pinnacle of World Cup Finals scorers. They then went on to defeat the Klinsmann-led United States 1–0, securing them a spot in the round of sixteen against Algeria.\n\n\nThe round of sixteen knockout match against Algeria remained goalless after regulation time, resulting in extra time. In the 92nd minute, André Schürrle scored a goal from a Thomas Müller pass. Mesut Özil scored Germany's second goal in the 120th minute. Algeria managed to score one goal in injury time and the match ended 2–1. Germany secured a place in the quarter-final, where they would face France.\n\n\nIn the quarter-final match against France, Mats Hummels scored in the 13th minute. Germany won the game 1–0 to advance to a record fourth consecutive semi-finals.[114]\n\n\n\n![](image)Germany posing with Champions banner after 2014 FIFA World Cup Final\nThe 7–1 semi-final win against Brazil was one of the most memorable games in World Cup history; Germany scored four goals in just less than seven minutes and were 5–0 up by the 30th minute with goals from Thomas Müller, Miroslav Klose, Sami Khedira and two from Toni Kroos. Germany's 7–0 in the second half was the highest score against Brazil in a single game. Germany conceded a late goal to Brazil's Oscar. It was Brazil's worst ever World Cup defeat,[115] whilst Germany broke multiple World Cup records with the win, including the record broken by Klose, the first team to reach four consecutive World Cup semi-finals, the first team to score seven goals in a World Cup Finals knockout phase game, the fastest five consecutive goals in World Cup history (four of which in just 400 seconds), and the first team to score five goals in the first half in a World Cup semi-final.[116]\n\n\nThe World Cup final was held at the Maracana in Rio de Janeiro on 13 July, and billed as the world's best player (Lionel Messi) versus the world's best team (Germany).[117][118] Mario Götze's 113th-minute goal helped Germany beat Argentina 1–0, becoming the first-ever European team to win a FIFA World Cup in the Americas and the second European team to win the title outside Europe.[119][120]\n\n\n\n#### Euro 2016 to 2017 Confederations Cup[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: UEFA Euro 2016 and 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup\n\nAfter several players retired from the team following the 2014 World Cup win, including Philipp Lahm, Per Mertesacker and Miroslav Klose, the team had a disappointing start in the UEFA Euro 2016 qualifiers. They defeated Scotland 2–1 at home, then suffered a 2–0 loss at Poland (the first in their history), a 1–1 draw against the Republic of Ireland, and a 4–0 win over Gibraltar. The year ended with an away 1–0 friendly win against Spain.\n\n\nTroubles during qualifying for the 2016 European Championship continued, drawing at home, as well as losing away, to Ireland; the team also only narrowly defeated Scotland on two occasions, but handily won the return against Poland and both games against Gibraltar (who competed for the first time). They would eventually win their group and qualify for the tournament through a 2–1 victory against Georgia on 11 October 2015.\n\n\nOn 13 November 2015, Germany played a friendly against France in Paris when a series of terrorist attacks took place in the city, some in the direct vicinity of the Stade de France, where the game was held.[121] For security reasons, the team spent the night inside the stadium, accompanied by the French squad who stayed behind in an act of comradery.[122] Four days later, Germany was scheduled to face the Netherlands at Hanover's HDI-Arena, in another friendly. After initial security reservations, the DFB decided to play the match on 15 November.[123] After reports about a concrete threat to the stadium, the match was cancelled 90 minutes before kickoff.[124]\n\n\nGermany began their campaign for a fourth European title with a 2–0 win against Ukraine on 12 June 2016. Against Poland, Germany was held to a 0–0 draw but concluded Group C play with a 1–0 win against Northern Ireland. In the Round of 16, Germany faced Slovakia and earned a comfortable 3–0 win. Germany then faced off against rivals Italy in the quarter-finals. Mesut Özil opened the scoring in the 65th minute for Germany, before Leonardo Bonucci drew even after converting a penalty in the 78th minute. The score remained 1–1 after extra time, and Germany beat Italy 6–5 in a penalty shootout. It was the first time Germany had overcome Italy in a major tournament.[125][126] The Germans lost to hosts France 2–0 in the semi-finals, their first competitive win against Germany in 58 years.[127]\n\n\nGermany qualified for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup after winning the 2014 World Cup, and won the last version of the Confederations Cup after a 1–0 win against Chile in the final at the Krestovsky Stadium in Saint Petersburg, Russia.[128]\n\n\n\n#### Disappointment at the 2018 World Cup, 2018–19 UEFA Nations League and Euro 2020[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fans in Hamburg watching the match between Germany and South Korea\nMain articles: 2018 FIFA World Cup, 2018–19 UEFA Nations League, and UEFA Euro 2020\n\nAfter winning all their qualifying matches and the Confederations Cup the previous year, Germany started their 2018 World Cup campaign with a defeat to Mexico, their first loss in an opening match since the 1982 World Cup.[129] Germany defeated Sweden 2–1 in their second game via an injury-time winner from Toni Kroos, but was subsequently eliminated following a 2–0 loss to South Korea, their first exit in the first round since 1938 and first in the group stage since the format had been reintroduced in 1950. With this result Germany became the fifth defending champions to be eliminated in the group stages of the World Cup, following Brazil in 1966, France in 2002, Italy in 2010, and Spain in 2014.[130][131]\n\n\nFollowing the World Cup, Germany's struggles continued into the inaugural UEFA Nations League. After a 0–0 draw at home against France, they lost 3–0 against the Netherlands[132] and 1–2 in the rematch against France three days later; the latter result being their fourth loss in six competitive matches.[133] These results meant that Germany could not advance to the 2019 UEFA Nations League Finals and faced the prospect of possible relegation to League B in the next Nations League.[133]\n\n\nAfter the Netherlands' win against France, the relegation to League B was originally confirmed, but due to the overhaul of the format for the 2020–21 UEFA Nations League, Germany was spared from relegation to League B.[134]\n\n\nIn March 2021, the DFB announced that Löw would step down as Germany's manager after Euro 2021.[135] Later that month, Germany lost 1–2 at home to North Macedonia in the 2022 World Cup qualifiers, their first World Cup qualification defeat since losing 5–1 to England in the 2002 World Cup qualifiers and only their third in history.[136] On 25 May 2021, the DFB announced that former assistant manager Hansi Flick will replace Löw as head coach.[137]\n\n\nAt Euro 2020 (delayed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic), Germany were drawn with World Cup champions France (to whom they lost 1–0) and reigning European champions Portugal (whom they defeated 4–2, albeit with the help of two Portuguese own goals), with each group having only two guaranteed qualifiers for the next phase, plus a chance for the third-placed team. In the final group match, the Hungarians took the lead twice only to draw. Germany then lost 2–0 to England in the round of 16, their first round of 16 exit in a major tournament since the 1938 World Cup.[138]\n\n\n\n### New era (2021–2023)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)\n\nFollowing Germany's disappointment at Euro 2020, Hansi Flick, former Bayern Munich manager, took over as coach of the national team. Success only followed from there, as Germany went on to beat Liechtenstein, Armenia, Iceland, Romania and North Macedonia in a month's succession. On 11 October 2021, Germany beat North Macedonia 4–0 to become the first team (outside of the hosts) to qualify for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.[139]\n\n\nIn the 2022–23 Nations League, Germany recorded their first-ever competitive win against Italy as the Germans beat the visitors 5–2. This was Germany's fourth game and first win in the league, however the Germans finished third in the group.[140]\n\n\nIn the 2022 World Cup, Germany were drawn into Group E with Spain, Japan and Costa Rica. The campaign started with a shock 2–1 defeat to Japan.[141] Germany drew 1–1 with Spain,[142] and then were knocked out of the World Cup in the group stage for the second consecutive tournament, despite a 4–2 win over Costa Rica, missing out on a place in the knockout stages on goal difference.[143]\n\n\nAfter several poor performances following Germany's World Cup exit – including a 1–4 home loss to Japan – Flick was dismissed on 10 September 2023, while Rudi Völler took interim charge of the team, leading the team to a 2–1 victory over France.[144]\n\n\nOn 22 September 2023, Julian Nagelsmann was named the new head coach.[145]\n\n\n\n## Team image[edit]\n\n\n### Kits and crest[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Germany national football team kits.\n\n![](image)The 2006 World Cup saw a widespread public display of the German national flag.\nThe national team's home kit has been traditionally a white shirt, black shorts, and white socks. The colours are derived from the 19th-century flag of the North German State of Prussia.[146] Since 1988, many of the home kit's designs incorporate details patterned after the modern German flag. For the 2014 World Cup, Germany's kit was white shorts rather than the traditional black due to FIFA's kit clashing rule for the tournament.[147] The away shirt colour has changed several times. Historically, a green shirt with white shorts is the most often used alternative colour combination, derived from the DFB colours – though it is often erroneously reported that the choice is in recognition of the fact that Ireland, whose home shirts are green, were the first nation to play Germany in a friendly game after World War II. However, the first team to play Germany after WWII, as stated above, was actually Switzerland.[148] Other colours such as red, grey and black have also been used.\n\n\nA change from black to red came in 2005 on the request of Jürgen Klinsmann,[149] but Germany played every game at the 2006 World Cup in its home white colours. In 2010, the away colours then changed back to a black shirt and white shorts, but at the World Cup, the team dressed up in the black shorts from the home kit. The kit used by Germany returned to a green shirt on its away kit, but then changed again to red-and-black striped shirts with white stripes and letters and black shorts.\n\n\nAdidas AG is the longstanding kit provider to the national team, a sponsorship that began in 1954 and is contracted to continue until at least 2022.[150] In the 70s, Germany wore Erima kits (a German brand, formerly a subsidiary of Adidas).[151][26]\n\n\nAs a common practice, three stars were added above the crest in 1996, symbolising Germany's World Cup titles in 1954, 1974 and 1990. In 2014, a fourth star was added after Germany were crowned world champions for the fourth time.\n\n\n\n#### Kit suppliers[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Kit supplier\n | Period\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Leuzela\n | unknown–1954\n | Germany wore Leuzela kits during the 1954 FIFA World Cup[152] |\n| ![](image) Umbro | 1966–1970\n | Germany wore Umbro kits during the 1966 and 1970 FIFA World Cups[153] |\n| ![](image) Adidas | 1954–present\n | In the 1970s, Germany wore Erima kits(a German brand, formerly a subsidiary of Adidas).[154][26] |\n\n\n#### Kit deals[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | This list is incomplete; you can help by adding missing items. *(June 2018)*\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Kit supplier\n | Period\n | Contract\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Announcement\n | Duration\n |\n| ![](image) Adidas | 1954–present\n | 20 June 2016\n | 2019–2022 (4 years)[155] | Per year: €50 million ($56.7 million) Total: €250 million ($283.5 million)[156][157] |\n| 10 September 2018\n | 2023–2026 (4 years)\n | Undisclosed[158] |\n\n\n### Home stadium[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Olympic Stadium in Berlin\nGermany plays its home matches among various stadiums, in rotation, around the country. They have played home matches in 43 different cities so far, including venues that were German at the time of the match, such as Vienna, Austria, which staged three games between 1938 and 1942.\n\n\nNational team matches have been held most often in Berlin (46 matches), which was the venue of Germany's first home match (in 1908 against England). Other common host cities include Hamburg (34 matches), Stuttgart (32), Hanover (28) and Dortmund. Munich also hosted noteworthy matches including the 1974 World Cup final.\n\n\n\n### Media coverage[edit]\n\n\nGermany's qualifying and friendly matches are televised by privately owned RTL; Nations

statistics\n\n* 1930–1938 as ![](image) → ![](image) → ![](image) Germany\n* 1950–1990 as ![](image) West Germany\n* 1994–present as ![](image) Germany\n\n\n  **Champions**    **Runners-up**    Third place     Tournament played fully or partially on home soil  \n\n\nGermany has won the FIFA World Cup four times, behind only Brazil's five.[170] It has finished as runners-up four times.[170] In terms of semi-final appearances, Germany leads with 13, two more than Brazil's 11, who have participated in every single tournament.[170] From 1954 to 2014 (16 tournaments), Germany reached at least the stage of the last eight teams, before being eliminated in the group stage in 2018.[170] Germany has also qualified for every one of the 19 World Cups for which it has entered – it did not enter the inaugural competition in Uruguay in 1930 for economic reasons, and were banned from the 1950 World Cup as the DFB was reinstated as a FIFA member only two months after this tournament.\n\n\nGermany has also won the European Championship three times, the joint-most with Spain. France and Italy, with two titles each, are the only other multiple winners. Germany finished as runners-up three times.[171] The Germans have qualified for every European Championship tournament except for the first European Championship they entered in 1968.[171] For that tournament, Germany was in the only group of three teams and thus only played four qualifying games. The deciding game was a scoreless draw in Albania which gave Yugoslavia the edge, having won in their neighbour country. The team finished outside the top eight in only three occasions: group stage eliminations in 2000[172] and 2004[173] alongside a round of 16 exit in 2020. In the other editions Germany participated in they reached at least the semi-finals nine times, an unparalleled record in Europe.\n\n\n*See also East Germany and Saarland for the results of these separate Germany teams, and Austria for the team that was merged into the Germany national team from 1938 to 1945.*\n\n\n\n### FIFA World Cup[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Germany at the FIFA World

*DFB-Elf* (DFB eleven), *DFB-Auswahl* (DFB selection) or *Nationalelf* (National eleven). Whereas in foreign media, they are regularly described as *Die Mannschaft* (The Team).[1] As of June 2015, this was acknowledged by the DFB as official branding of the team.[2] In July 2022 the German Football Association abolished this branding as an official nickname,[3] due to rejection by many German fans.[4]\n2. **^** This match is not considered to be a full international by the English FA, and does not appear in the records of the England team.\n3. **^** By Germany national team, East Germany national team, United Team of Germany and Germany national under-23 team\n4. **^** In early times it was simply called *\"die 11 besten Spieler von Deutschland\"* or just *\"die Bundesauswahl\" (the Federation XI)*. Tags like *\"National team\"* or *\"National XI\"* weren't introduced until after World War I\n5. **^** Since 1992, Olympic football has been a tournament for the U23 national football teams\n6. **^** As 1990 FIFA World Cup champions\n7. **^** As UEFA Euro 1996 champions\n8. **^** As 2002 FIFA World Cup runners-up\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"The \"Mannschaft\" :: National Teams :: DFB – Deutscher Fußball-Bund e.V.\" *dfb.de*.

The latter two were absorbed along with their records;[13][14] the present team represents the reunified Federal Republic. The official name and code \"Germany FR (FRG)\" was shortened to \"Germany (GER)\" following reunification in 1990.\n\n\nGermany is one of the most successful national teams in international competitions, having won four World Cups (1954, 1974, 1990, 2014), tied with Italy, and only one less than the most successful team, Brazil. Having won three European Championships (1972, 1980, 1996) Germany is along with Spain the record holder in that international competition. Germany won also a Confederations Cup (2017).[11] They have also been runners-up at the European Championship three times, and four times at the World Cup, with a further four third-place finishes at the World Cup.[11] East Germany won Olympic Gold in 1976.[15] Germany is one of only two nations to have won both the FIFA World Cup and the FIFA Women's World Cup (the other being Spain).[16][17] By combined World Cups, Germany stands as the most successful football nation in history with six World Cups – four for the men's team and two for the women's. At the end of the 2014 World Cup, Germany earned the second highest Elo rating of any national football team in history, with 2,223 points.[18] Germany is also the only European nation that has won a FIFA World Cup in the Americas.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the Germany national football team\n\n### Early years (1899–1942)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Germany national team at its first official international match in 1908\nOn 18 April 1897, an early international game on German soil was played in Hamburg when a selection team from the Danish Football Association defeated a selection team from the Hamburg-Altona Football Association, 5–0.[19][20]\n\n\nBetween 1899 and 1901, prior to the formation of a national team, there were five international matches between Germany and English selection teams, which are today not recognised as official by either nation's football association (in part because England fielded their amateur side, which was an overflow or B team). All five matches ended in large defeats for the Germany teams, including a 12–0 loss at White Hart Lane in September 1901.[21] Eight years after the establishment of the German Football Association (DFB) in 1900, the first official match of the Germany national football team[d] was played on 5 April 1908, against Switzerland in Basel, with the Swiss winning 5–3.[7] A follow-up to the earlier series between England Amateurs and Germany occurred in March 1909 at Oxford's White House Ground[22] and resulted in Germany's largest official defeat to date: 9–0 (this time, the match was recognised and recorded as official by the DFB but not by the FA, again due to the amateur side being fielded).[21] These early confrontations formed the beginning of the rich rivalry between the two teams: one of the longest and most enduring international rivalries in football.[23]\n\n\nJulius Hirsch was the first Jewish player to represent the Germany national football team, which he joined in 1911.[24][25] Hirsch scored four goals for Germany against the Netherlands in 1912, becoming the first German to score four goals in a single match.[26][27]\n\n\n\n![](image)Gottfried Fuchs\nGottfried Fuchs scored a world record 10 goals for Germany in a 16–0 win against Russia at the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm on 1 July, becoming the top scorer of the tournament; his international record was not surpassed until 2001 when Australia's Archie Thompson scored 13 goals in a 31–0 defeat of American Samoa.[28] He was Jewish, and the German Football Association erased all references to him from their records between 1933 and 1945.[29][30] As of 2016, he was still the top German scorer for one match.[31]\n\n\nAt that time the players were selected by the DFB, as there was no dedicated coach. The first manager of the Germany national team was Otto Nerz, a school teacher from Mannheim, who served in the role from 1926 to 1936.[32] The German FA could not afford travel to Uruguay for the first World Cup staged in 1930 during the Great Depression, but finished third in the 1934 World Cup in their first appearance in the competition. After a poor showing at the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin, Sepp Herberger became coach. In 1937 he put together a squad which was soon nicknamed the *Breslau Elf* (the Breslau Eleven) in recognition of their 8–0 win over Denmark in the then German city of Breslau, Lower Silesia (now Wrocław, Poland).[33][34]\n\n\nAfter Austria became part of Germany in the *Anschluss* of March 1938, the Austrian national team – one of Europe's best sides at the time due to professionalism – was disbanded despite having already qualified for the 1938 World Cup. Nazi politicians ordered five or six ex-Austrian players, from the clubs Rapid Vienna, Austria Vienna, and First Vienna FC, to join the \"all-German\" team on short notice in a staged show of unity for political reasons. At the 1938 World Cup in France, this \"united\" Germany national team managed only a 1–1 draw against Switzerland and then lost the replay 2–4 in front of a hostile crowd in Paris. That early exit stands as Germany's worst World Cup result, and one of just three occasions the team failed to progress from the group stage – the next would not occur until the 2018 tournament, and it would be repeated in 2022.\n\n\nDuring World War II, the team played over 30 international games between September 1939 and November 1942. National team games were then suspended, as most players had to join the armed forces. Many of the national team players were gathered together under coach Herberger as *Rote Jäger* through the efforts of a sympathetic air force officer trying to protect the footballers from the most dangerous wartime service.\n\n\n\n### Three Germany national teams (1945–1990)[edit]\n\n\nAfter World War II, Germany was banned from competition in most sports until 1950. The DFB was not a full member of FIFA, and none of the three new German states – West Germany, East Germany, and Saarland – entered the 1950 World Cup qualifiers.\n\n\nThe Federal Republic of Germany, which was referred to as West Germany, continued the DFB. With recognition by FIFA and UEFA, the DFB maintained and continued the record of the pre-war team. Switzerland was the first team that played West Germany in 1950,[35] with the latter qualifying for the 1954 World Cup and the former hosting it.\n\n\nThe Saarland, a French protectorate between 1947 and 1956, did not join French organisations, and was barred from participating in pan-German ones. It sent their own team to the 1952 Summer Olympics and to the 1954 World Cup qualifiers. In 1957, Saarland acceded to the Federal Republic of Germany.\n\n\nIn 1949, the communist German Democratic Republic (East Germany) was founded. In 1952 the *Deutscher Fußball-Verband der DDR* (DFV) was established and the East Germany national football team took to the field. They were the only team to beat the 1974 FIFA World Cup winning West Germans in the only meeting of the two sides of the divided nation. East Germany won the gold medal at the 1976 Olympics. After German reunification in 1990, the eastern football competition was reintegrated into the DFB.\n\n\n\n### 1954 World Cup victory[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1954 FIFA World Cup final\n\n![](image)Helmut Rahn scored the winning goal in the 1954 FIFA World Cup final.\nWest Germany, captained by Fritz Walter, met in the 1954 World Cup against Turkey, Yugoslavia and Austria. When playing favourites Hungary in the group stage, West Germany lost 3–8, and faced the Hungarian \"Mighty Magyars\" again in the final. Hungary had gone unbeaten for 32 consecutive matches, and West Germany snapped the streak by winning 3–2, with Helmut Rahn scoring the winning goal.[36] The success is called \"The Miracle of Bern\" (*Das Wunder von Bern*).[37]\n\n\n\n### Memorable losses: Wembley goal and game of the century (1958–1970)[edit]\n\n\nAfter finishing fourth in the 1958 World Cup and reaching only the quarter-finals in the 1962 World Cup, the DFB made changes. Professionalism was introduced, and the best clubs from the various Regionalligas were assembled into the new Bundesliga. In 1964, Helmut Schön took over as coach, replacing Herberger who had been in office for 28 years.\n\n\nIn the 1966 World Cup, West Germany reached the final after beating the USSR in the semi-final, facing hosts England. In extra time, the first goal by Geoff Hurst was one of the most contentious goals in the history of the World Cup: the linesman signalled the ball had crossed the line for a goal, after bouncing down from the crossbar, when replays showed it did not appear to have fully crossed the line. Hurst then scored another goal giving England a 4–2 win.[38][39]\n\n\nWest Germany in the 1970 World Cup knocked England out in the quarter-finals 3–2, before they suffered a 4–3 extra-time loss in the semi-final against Italy. This match with five goals in extra time is one of the most dramatic in World Cup history, and is called the \"Game of the Century\" in both Italy and Germany.[40][41] West Germany claimed third by beating Uruguay 1–0. Gerd Müller finished as the tournament's top scorer with 10 goals.\n\n\n\n### 1974 World Cup title on home soil[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1974 FIFA World Cup\n\n![](image)The 1974 FIFA World Cup Final on 7 July, in Munich's Olympiastadion\nIn 1971, Franz Beckenbauer became captain of the national team, and he led West Germany to victory at the European Championship at Euro 1972, defeating the Soviet Union 3–0 in the final.[42][43]\n\n\nAs hosts of the 1974 World Cup, they won their second World Cup, defeating the Netherlands 2–1 in the final in Munich.[44]\nTwo matches in the 1974 World Cup stood out for West Germany. The first group stage saw a politically charged match as West Germany played a game against East Germany. The East Germans won 1–0 but it made a scant difference to West Germany as the West Germans advanced to the knockout stage.[45] The West Germans advanced to the final against the Johan Cruijff-led Dutch team and their brand of \"Total Football\". The Dutch took the lead from a penalty. However, West Germany tied the match on a penalty by Paul Breitner, and won it with Gerd Müller's fine finish soon after.[46][47]\n\n\n\n### Late 1970s and early 1980s[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gerd Müller in 1974\nWest Germany failed to defend their titles in the next two major international tournaments. They lost to Czechoslovakia in the UEFA Euro 1976 final in a penalty shootout 5–3,[48] their last penalty shootout loss in a major tournament as of 2022.[49]\n\n\nIn the 1978 World Cup, Germany was eliminated in the second group stage after losing 3–2 to Austria. Schön retired as coach afterward, and the post was taken over by his assistant, Jupp Derwall.\n\n\nWest Germany's first tournament under Derwall was successful, as they earned their second European title at Euro 1980 after defeating Belgium 2–1 in the final.[50] West Germany started the 1982 World Cup with a 1–2 upset by newcomers Algeria in their first match,[51] but advanced to the second round with a controversial 1–0 win over Austria. In the semi-final against France, they tied the match 3–3 and won the penalty shootout 5–4.[52][53] In the final, they were defeated by Italy 1–3.[54]\n\n\nDuring this period, West Germany's Gerd Müller racked up fourteen goals in two World Cups (1970 and 1974). His ten goals in 1970 are the third-most ever in a tournament. Müller's all-time World Cup record of 14 goals was broken by Ronaldo in 2006; this was then further broken by Miroslav Klose in 2014 with 16 goals.[55]\n\n\n\n### Beckenbauer's managing success (1984–1990)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Franz Beckenbauer in 1990\nAfter West Germany were eliminated in the first round of Euro 1984, Franz Beckenbauer returned to the national team to replace Derwall as manager.[56] At the 1986 World Cup in Mexico, West Germany finished as runners-up for the second consecutive tournament after beating France 2–0 in the semi-finals, but losing to the Diego Maradona-led Argentina in the final, 2–3.[57][58] In Euro 1988, after drawing Italy 1–1 and beating both Denmark and Spain 2–0 in the group stage,[59] West Germany's hopes of winning the tournament on home soil were spoiled by the Netherlands, as the Dutch beat them 2–1 in the semi-finals.[60][61]\n\n\nAt the 1990 World Cup in Italy, West Germany won their third World Cup title, in its unprecedented third consecutive final appearance.[62] Captained by Lothar Matthäus, they defeated Yugoslavia (4–1), UAE (5–1), the Netherlands (2–1), Czechoslovakia (1–0), and England (1–1, 4–3 on penalty kicks) on the way to a final rematch against Argentina in Rome.[63][64] West Germany won 1–0, with the only goal being a penalty scored in the 85th minute by Andreas Brehme.[62] Beckenbauer, who won the World Cup as the national team's captain in 1974, thus became the first person to win the World Cup as both captain and manager,[56] and the second to win as player and manager, after Mario Zagallo of Brazil.\n\n\n\n### Olympic football[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Germany Olympic football team\n\n\n\n| Medal record\n |\n| --- |\n| Summer Olympic Games |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) | 1976 Montreal | Team |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) | 1980 Moscow | Team |\n| ![Bronze medal – third place](image) | 1964 Tokyo | Team |\n| ![Bronze medal – third place](image) | 1972 Munich | Team |\n| ![Bronze medal – third place](image) | 1988 Seoul | Team |\n\n\nEast Germany did however achieve significantly greater success in Olympic football than the amateur teams fielded by the Western NOC of Germany due to using its elite players from the top domestic league. In 1956, 1960, and 1964 both states had sent a United Team of Germany. For 1964, the East German side had beaten their Western counterparts in order to be selected. They went on to win the bronze medal for Germany. As GDR, they won bronze in 1972 in Munich, gold in 1976 in Montreal, and silver in 1980 in Moscow.\n\n\nPrior to 1984, Olympic football was an amateur event, meaning that only non-professional players could participate.[e] Due to this, West Germany was never able to achieve the same degree of success at the Olympics as at the World Cup. The first medal coming in the 1988 Olympics, when they won the bronze medal after beating Italy 3–0 in the 3rd place match.[65] West Germany also reached the second round in both 1972 and 1984. On the other hand, due to having an ability to field its top-level players who were classified as amateurs on a technicality East Germany did better, winning a gold, a silver and two bronze medals (one representing the United Team of Germany).\n\n\n\n### Berti Vogts years (1990–1998)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Berti Vogts\nIn February 1990, months after the fall of the Berlin Wall, East Germany and West Germany were drawn together in UEFA Euro 1992 qualifying Group 5. In November 1990, the East German association Deutscher Fußball-Verband integrated into the DFB, by which time the East Germany team had ceased operations, playing its last match on 12 September 1990. The unified Germany national team completed the European Championship qualifying group. The East German 1990–91 league continued, with a restructuring of German leagues in 1991–92. The first game with a unified Germany national team was against Switzerland on 19 December.[66]\n\n\nAfter the 1990 World Cup, assistant Berti Vogts took over as the national team coach from the retiring Beckenbauer. In Euro 1992, Germany reached the final, but lost 0–2 to underdogs Denmark.[67]\nIn the 1994 World Cup, they were upset 1–2 in the quarterfinals by Bulgaria.[68][69]\n\n\nReunified Germany won its first major international title at Euro 1996, becoming European champions for the third time.[70] They defeated hosts England in the semi-finals,[71] and the Czech Republic 2–1 in the final on a golden goal in extra time.[72]\n\n\nHowever, in the 1998 World Cup, Germany were eliminated in the quarterfinals in a 0–3 defeat to Croatia, all goals being scored after defender Christian Wörns received a straight red card.[73] Vogts stepped down afterwards and was replaced by Erich Ribbeck.[74]\n\n\n\n### Erich Ribbeck and Rudi Völler years (2000–2004)[edit]\n\n\nIn Euro 2000, the team went out in the first round, drawing with Romania, then suffering a 1–0 defeat to England and were routed 3–0 by Portugal (which fielded their backup players, having already advanced).[75] Ribbeck resigned, and was replaced by Rudi Völler.[76]\n\n\nComing into the 2002 World Cup, expectations of Germany were low due to poor results in the qualifiers, and not directly qualifying for the finals for the first time. The team advanced through group play, and in the knockout stages they produced three consecutive 1–0 wins against Paraguay,[77] the United States,[78] and co-hosts South Korea. Oliver Neuville scored two minutes from time against Paraguay and Michael Ballack scored both goals in the US and South Korea games, although he picked up a second yellow card against South Korea for a tactical foul and was suspended for the subsequent match.[79] This set up a final against Brazil, the first World Cup meeting between the two. Germany lost 0–2 thanks to two Ronaldo goals.[80] Nevertheless, German captain and goalkeeper Oliver Kahn won the Golden Ball,[81] the first time in the World Cup that a goalkeeper was named the best player of the tournament.[82]\n\n\n\n![](image)Fans watching Germany play against Argentina in the 2006 World Cup match at the Donau Arena in Regensburg\nGermany again exited in the first round of Euro 2004, drawing their first two matches and losing the third to the Czech Republic (who had fielded a second-string team).[83] Völler resigned afterwards, and Jürgen Klinsmann was appointed head coach.[84][85]\n\n\n\n### Resurgence under Klinsmann (2004–2006)[edit]\n\n\nKlinsmann's main task was to lead the national team to a good showing at the 2006 World Cup in Germany. He relieved goalkeeper Kahn of the captaincy and announced that Kahn and longtime backup Jens Lehmann would be competing for the position of starting goaltender, a decision that angered Kahn and Lehmann eventually won that contest.[86] Expectations for the team were low, which was not helped by veteran defender Christian Wörns being dropped (after Wörns criticised Klinsmann for designating him only as a backup player on the squad), a choice roundly panned in Germany. Italy routed Germany 4–1 in a March 2006 exhibition game, and Klinsmann bore the brunt of the criticism as the team was ranked only 22nd in the world entering the 2006 World Cup.[87]\n\n\nAs World Cup hosts, Germany won all three group stage matches to finish top of their group. The team defeated Sweden 2–0 in the round of 16,[88]\nand Argentina in the quarter-finals in a penalty shootout.[89][90][91] The semi-final against Italy was scoreless until near the end of extra time when Germany conceded two goals.[92]\nIn the third place match, Germany defeated Portugal 3–1.[93]\nMiroslav Klose was awarded the Golden Boot for his tournament-leading five goals.[94]\n\n\n\n### Löw era (2006–2021)[edit]\n\n\n#### Euro 2008, 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: UEFA Euro 2008, 2010 FIFA World Cup, and UEFA Euro 2012\n\nGermany's entry into the Euro 2008 qualifying round was marked by the promotion of Joachim Löw to head coach, since Klinsmann resigned.[95]\nAt UEFA Euro 2008, Germany won two out of three matches in group play to advance to the knockout round.[96]\nThey defeated Portugal 3–2 in the quarterfinal,[97]\nand won their semi-final against Turkey.[98]\nGermany lost the final against Spain 0–1, finishing as the runners-up.[99]\n\n\nIn the 2010 World Cup, Germany won the group and advanced to the knockout stage. In the round of 16, Germany defeated England 4–1.[100] The game controversially had a valid goal by Frank Lampard disallowed.[101][102][103] In the quarter-finals, Germany defeated Argentina 4–0,[104] and Miroslav Klose tied German Gerd Müller's record of 14 World Cup goals.[105]\nIn the semi-final, Germany lost 1–0 to Spain.[106] Germany defeated Uruguay 3–2 to take third place (their second third place after 2006).[107] German Thomas Müller won the Golden Boot and the Best Young Player Award.[108][109]\n\n\n\n![](image)Germany during Euro 2012 qualifiers\nIn Euro 2012, Germany was placed in group B along with Portugal, Netherlands, and Denmark. Germany won all three group matches. Germany defeated Greece in the quarter-final and set a record of 15 consecutive wins in all competitive matches.[110] In the semi-finals, Germany lost to Italy, 1–2.\n\n\n\n#### 2014 World Cup victory[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 FIFA World Cup\n\n![](image)Germany lifting the World Cup trophy in 2014\nGermany were placed in Group G of the 2014 World Cup,[111] with Portugal, Ghana, and the United States. They first faced Portugal in a match billed by some as the \"team of all the talents against the team of The Talent (Cristiano Ronaldo)\", routing the Portuguese 4–0 thanks to a hat-trick by Thomas Müller.[112][113] In their match with Ghana, they led the game with Götze's second half goal, but then conceded two consecutive goals. Klose scored a goal to level Germany 2–2, his 15th World Cup goal to join former Brazil striker Ronaldo at the pinnacle of World Cup Finals scorers. They then went on to defeat the Klinsmann-led United States 1–0, securing them a spot in the round of sixteen against Algeria.\n\n\nThe round of sixteen knockout match against Algeria remained goalless after regulation time, resulting in extra time. In the 92nd minute, André Schürrle scored a goal from a Thomas Müller pass. Mesut Özil scored Germany's second goal in the 120th minute. Algeria managed to score one goal in injury time and the match ended 2–1. Germany secured a place in the quarter-final, where they would face France.\n\n\nIn the quarter-final match against France, Mats Hummels scored in the 13th minute. Germany won the game 1–0 to advance to a record fourth consecutive semi-finals.[114]\n\n\n\n![](image)Germany posing with Champions banner after 2014 FIFA World Cup Final\nThe 7–1 semi-final win against Brazil was one of the most memorable games in World Cup history; Germany scored four goals in just less than seven minutes and were 5–0 up by the 30th minute with goals from Thomas Müller, Miroslav Klose, Sami Khedira and two from Toni Kroos. Germany's 7–0 in the second half was the highest score against Brazil in a single game. Germany conceded a late goal to Brazil's Oscar. It was Brazil's worst ever World Cup defeat,[115] whilst Germany broke multiple World Cup records with the win, including the record broken by Klose, the first team to reach four consecutive World Cup semi-finals, the first team to score seven goals in a World Cup Finals knockout phase game, the fastest five consecutive goals in World Cup history (four of which in just 400 seconds), and the first team to score five goals in the first half in a World Cup semi-final.[116]\n\n\nThe World Cup final was held at the Maracana in Rio de Janeiro on 13 July, and billed as the world's best player (Lionel Messi) versus the world's best team (Germany).[117][118] Mario Götze's 113th-minute goal helped Germany beat Argentina 1–0, becoming the first-ever European team to win a FIFA World Cup in the Americas and the second European team to win the title outside Europe.[119][120]\n\n\n\n#### Euro 2016 to 2017 Confederations Cup[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: UEFA Euro 2016 and 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup\n\nAfter several players retired from the team following the 2014 World Cup win, including Philipp Lahm, Per Mertesacker and Miroslav Klose, the team had a disappointing start in the UEFA Euro 2016 qualifiers. They defeated Scotland 2–1 at home, then suffered a 2–0 loss at Poland (the first in their history), a 1–1 draw against the Republic of Ireland, and a 4–0 win over Gibraltar. The year ended with an away 1–0 friendly win against Spain.\n\n\nTroubles during qualifying for the 2016 European Championship continued, drawing at home, as well as losing away, to Ireland; the team also only narrowly defeated Scotland on two occasions, but handily won the return against Poland and both games against Gibraltar (who competed for the first time). They would eventually win their group and qualify for the tournament through a 2–1 victory against Georgia on 11 October 2015.\n\n\nOn 13 November 2015, Germany played a friendly against France in Paris when a series of terrorist attacks took place in the city, some in the direct vicinity of the Stade de France, where the game was held.[121] For security reasons, the team spent the night inside the stadium, accompanied by the French squad who stayed behind in an act of comradery.[122] Four days later, Germany was scheduled to face the Netherlands at Hanover's HDI-Arena, in another friendly. After initial security reservations, the DFB decided to play the match on 15 November.[123] After reports about a concrete threat to the stadium, the match was cancelled 90 minutes before kickoff.[124]\n\n\nGermany began their campaign for a fourth European title with a 2–0 win against Ukraine on 12 June 2016. Against Poland, Germany was held to a 0–0 draw but concluded Group C play with a 1–0 win against Northern Ireland. In the Round of 16, Germany faced Slovakia and earned a comfortable 3–0 win. Germany then faced off against rivals Italy in the quarter-finals. Mesut Özil opened the scoring in the 65th minute for Germany, before Leonardo Bonucci drew even after converting a penalty in the 78th minute. The score remained 1–1 after extra time, and Germany beat Italy 6–5 in a penalty shootout. It was the first time Germany had overcome Italy in a major tournament.[125][126] The Germans lost to hosts France 2–0 in the semi-finals, their first competitive win against Germany in 58 years.[127]\n\n\nGermany qualified for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup after winning the 2014 World Cup, and won the last version of the Confederations Cup after a 1–0 win against Chile in the final at the Krestovsky Stadium in Saint Petersburg, Russia.[128]\n\n\n\n#### Disappointment at the 2018 World Cup, 2018–19 UEFA Nations League and Euro 2020[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fans in Hamburg watching the match between Germany and South Korea\nMain articles: 2018 FIFA World Cup, 2018–19 UEFA Nations League, and UEFA Euro 2020\n\nAfter winning all their qualifying matches and the Confederations Cup the previous year, Germany started their 2018 World Cup campaign with a defeat to Mexico, their first loss in an opening match since the 1982 World Cup.[129] Germany defeated Sweden 2–1 in their second game via an injury-time winner from Toni Kroos, but was subsequently eliminated following a 2–0 loss to South Korea, their first exit in the first round since 1938 and first in the group stage since the format had been reintroduced in 1950. With this result Germany became the fifth defending champions to be eliminated in the group stages of the World Cup, following Brazil in 1966, France in 2002, Italy in 2010, and Spain in 2014.[130][131]\n\n\nFollowing the World Cup, Germany's struggles continued into the inaugural UEFA Nations League. After a 0–0 draw at home against France, they lost 3–0 against the Netherlands[132] and 1–2 in the rematch against France three days later; the latter result being their fourth loss in six competitive matches.[133] These results meant that Germany could not advance to the 2019 UEFA Nations League Finals and faced the prospect of possible relegation to League B in the next Nations League.[133]\n\n\nAfter the Netherlands' win against France, the relegation to League B was originally confirmed, but due to the overhaul of the format for the 2020–21 UEFA Nations League, Germany was spared from relegation to League B.[134]\n\n\nIn March 2021, the DFB announced that Löw would step down as Germany's manager after Euro 2021.[135] Later that month, Germany lost 1–2 at home to North Macedonia in the 2022 World Cup qualifiers, their first World Cup qualification defeat since losing 5–1 to England in the 2002 World Cup qualifiers and only their third in history.[136] On 25 May 2021, the DFB announced that former assistant manager Hansi Flick will replace Löw as head coach.[137]\n\n\nAt Euro 2020 (delayed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic), Germany were drawn with World Cup champions France (to whom they lost 1–0) and reigning European champions Portugal (whom they defeated 4–2, albeit with the help of two Portuguese own goals), with each group having only two guaranteed qualifiers for the next phase, plus a chance for the third-placed team. In the final group match, the Hungarians took the lead twice only to draw. Germany then lost 2–0 to England in the round of 16, their first round of 16 exit in a major tournament since the 1938 World Cup.[138]\n\n\n\n### New era (2021–2023)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)\n\nFollowing Germany's disappointment at Euro 2020, Hansi Flick, former Bayern Munich manager, took over as coach of the national team. Success only followed from there, as Germany went on to beat Liechtenstein, Armenia, Iceland, Romania and North Macedonia in a month's succession. On 11 October 2021, Germany beat North Macedonia 4–0 to become the first team (outside of the hosts) to qualify for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.[139]\n\n\nIn the 2022–23 Nations League, Germany recorded their first-ever competitive win against Italy as the Germans beat the visitors 5–2. This was Germany's fourth game and first win in the league, however the Germans finished third in the group.[140]\n\n\nIn the 2022 World Cup, Germany were drawn into Group E with Spain, Japan and Costa Rica. The campaign started with a shock 2–1 defeat to Japan.[141] Germany drew 1–1 with Spain,[142] and then were knocked out of the World Cup in the group stage for the second consecutive tournament, despite a 4–2 win over Costa Rica, missing out on a place in the knockout stages on goal difference.[143]\n\n\nAfter several poor performances following Germany's World Cup exit – including a 1–4 home loss to Japan – Flick was dismissed on 10 September 2023, while Rudi Völler took interim charge of the team, leading the team to a 2–1 victory over France.[144]\n\n\nOn 22 September 2023, Julian Nagelsmann was named the new head coach.[145]\n\n\n\n## Team image[edit]\n\n\n### Kits and crest[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Germany national football team kits.\n\n![](image)The 2006 World Cup saw a widespread public display of the German national flag.\nThe national team's home kit has been traditionally a white shirt, black shorts, and white socks. The colours are derived from the 19th-century flag of the North German State of Prussia.[146] Since 1988, many of the home kit's designs incorporate details patterned after the modern German flag. For the 2014 World Cup, Germany's kit was white shorts rather than the traditional black due to FIFA's kit clashing rule for the tournament.[147] The away shirt colour has changed several times. Historically, a green shirt with white shorts is the most often used alternative colour combination, derived from the DFB colours – though it is often erroneously reported that the choice is in recognition of the fact that Ireland, whose home shirts are green, were the first nation to play Germany in a friendly game after World War II. However, the first team to play Germany after WWII, as stated above, was actually Switzerland.[148] Other colours such as red, grey and black have also been used.\n\n\nA change from black to red came in 2005 on the request of Jürgen Klinsmann,[149] but Germany played every game at the 2006 World Cup in its home white colours. In 2010, the away colours then changed back to a black shirt and white shorts, but at the World Cup, the team dressed up in the black shorts from the home kit. The kit used by Germany returned to a green shirt on its away kit, but then changed again to red-and-black striped shirts with white stripes and letters and black shorts.\n\n\nAdidas AG is the longstanding kit provider to the national team, a sponsorship that began in 1954 and is contracted to continue until at least 2022.[150] In the 70s, Germany wore Erima kits (a German brand, formerly a subsidiary of Adidas).[151][26]\n\n\nAs a common practice, three stars were added above the crest in 1996, symbolising Germany's World Cup titles in 1954, 1974 and 1990. In 2014, a fourth star was added after Germany were crowned world champions for the fourth time.\n\n\n\n#### Kit suppliers[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Kit supplier\n | Period\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Leuzela\n | unknown–1954\n | Germany wore Leuzela kits during the 1954 FIFA World Cup[152] |\n| ![](image) Umbro | 1966–1970\n | Germany wore Umbro kits during the 1966 and 1970 FIFA World Cups[153] |\n| ![](image) Adidas | 1954–present\n | In the 1970s, Germany wore Erima kits(a German brand, formerly a subsidiary of Adidas).[154][26] |\n\n\n#### Kit deals[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | This list is incomplete; you can help by adding missing items. *(June 2018)*\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Kit supplier\n | Period\n | Contract\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Announcement\n | Duration\n |\n| ![](image) Adidas | 1954–present\n | 20 June 2016\n | 2019–2022 (4 years)[155] | Per year: €50 million ($56.7 million) Total: €250 million ($283.5 million)[156][157] |\n| 10 September 2018\n | 2023–2026 (4 years)\n | Undisclosed[158] |\n\n\n### Home stadium[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Olympic Stadium in Berlin\nGermany plays its home matches among various stadiums, in rotation, around the country. They have played home matches in 43 different cities so far, including venues that were German at the time of the match, such as Vienna, Austria, which staged three games between 1938 and 1942.\n\n\nNational team matches have been held most often in Berlin (46 matches), which was the venue of Germany's first home match (in 1908 against England). Other common host cities include Hamburg (34 matches), Stuttgart (32), Hanover (28) and Dortmund. Munich also hosted noteworthy matches including the 1974 World Cup final.\n\n\n\n### Media coverage[edit]\n\n\nGermany's qualifying and friendly matches are televised by privately owned RTL; Nations

statistics\n\n* 1930–1938 as ![](image) → ![](image) → ![](image) Germany\n* 1950–1990 as ![](image) West Germany\n* 1994–present as ![](image) Germany\n\n\n  **Champions**    **Runners-up**    Third place     Tournament played fully or partially on home soil  \n\n\nGermany has won the FIFA World Cup four times, behind only Brazil's five.[170] It has finished as runners-up four times.[170] In terms of semi-final appearances, Germany leads with 13, two more than Brazil's 11, who have participated in every single tournament.[170] From 1954 to 2014 (16 tournaments), Germany reached at least the stage of the last eight teams, before being eliminated in the group stage in 2018.[170] Germany has also qualified for every one of the 19 World Cups for which it has entered – it did not enter the inaugural competition in Uruguay in 1930 for economic reasons, and were banned from the 1950 World Cup as the DFB was reinstated as a FIFA member only two months after this tournament.\n\n\nGermany has also won the European Championship three times, the joint-most with Spain. France and Italy, with two titles each, are the only other multiple winners. Germany finished as runners-up three times.[171] The Germans have qualified for every European Championship tournament except for the first European Championship they entered in 1968.[171] For that tournament, Germany was in the only group of three teams and thus only played four qualifying games. The deciding game was a scoreless draw in Albania which gave Yugoslavia the edge, having won in their neighbour country. The team finished outside the top eight in only three occasions: group stage eliminations in 2000[172] and 2004[173] alongside a round of 16 exit in 2020. In the other editions Germany participated in they reached at least the semi-finals nine times, an unparalleled record in Europe.\n\n\n*See also East Germany and Saarland for the results of these separate Germany teams, and Austria for the team that was merged into the Germany national team from 1938 to 1945.*\n\n\n\n### FIFA World Cup[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Germany at the FIFA World

*DFB-Elf* (DFB eleven), *DFB-Auswahl* (DFB selection) or *Nationalelf* (National eleven). Whereas in foreign media, they are regularly described as *Die Mannschaft* (The Team).[1] As of June 2015, this was acknowledged by the DFB as official branding of the team.[2] In July 2022 the German Football Association abolished this branding as an official nickname,[3] due to rejection by many German fans.[4]\n2. **^** This match is not considered to be a full international by the English FA, and does not appear in the records of the England team.\n3. **^** By Germany national team, East Germany national team, United Team of Germany and Germany national under-23 team\n4. **^** In early times it was simply called *\"die 11 besten Spieler von Deutschland\"* or just *\"die Bundesauswahl\" (the Federation XI)*. Tags like *\"National team\"* or *\"National XI\"* weren't introduced until after World War I\n5. **^** Since 1992, Olympic football has been a tournament for the U23 national football teams\n6. **^** As 1990 FIFA World Cup champions\n7. **^** As UEFA Euro 1996 champions\n8. **^** As 2002 FIFA World Cup runners-up\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"The \"Mannschaft\" :: National Teams :: DFB – Deutscher Fußball-Bund e.V.\" *dfb.de*.

It is governed by the Royal Spanish Football Federation, the governing body for football in Spain.\n\n\nSpain is one of eight national teams to have been crowned world champions and have participated in a total of 16 of 22 FIFA World Cups, also qualifying consistently since 1978. Spain have won three continental titles during their appearances of 11 out of 16 UEFA European Championships. Spain currently competes in League A of the UEFA Nations League alongside the other top teams of Europe. Their best result was in the 2022–23 season where they reached the final, winning against Croatia.\n\n\nSpain's achievements from 2008–2012 have led many experts and commentators to consider this era's Spain squads one of the best ever teams in football history.[5][6][7][8][9] During this period, Spain became the only national team to win three consecutive major titles, including two back-to-back European Championships in 2008 and 2012, while becoming the first European team to win a World Cup held outside of Europe in 2010.[10] From 2008 to 2013, Spain won the FIFA Team of the Year, the second-most of any nation, behind only Brazil.[11] From the start of 2007 to the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup, Spain achieved 35 consecutive undefeated matches, a feat which they shared with Brazil, and a sport record at the time. Spain along with France are the only two European countries to have won the triplete (World Cup, Euro, Nations League).\nSpain is one of only two nations to have won both the FIFA World Cup and the FIFA Women's World Cup (the other being Germany).\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: History of the Spain national football team\n\n![](image)Spain national football team in the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp\nSpain has been a member of FIFA since its founding in 1904, even though the Spanish Football Federation was first established in 1909. The first Spain national football team was constituted in 1920, with the main objective of finding a team that would represent Spain at the 1920 Summer Olympics held in Belgium in that same year. Spain made their debut at the tournament on 28 August 1920 against Denmark, silver medalists at the last two Olympic tournaments. Spain managed to win that match by a scoreline of 1–0, eventually finishing with the silver medal.[12] Spain qualified for their first FIFA World Cup in 1934, defeating Brazil in their first game and losing in a replay to the hosts and eventual champions Italy in the quarter-finals.[13] The Spanish Civil War and World War II prevented Spain from playing any competitive matches between the 1934 World Cup and the 1950 edition's qualifiers. At the 1950 finals in Brazil, they topped their group to progress to the finals round, then finished in fourth place.[14] Until 2010, this had been Spain's highest finish in a FIFA World Cup finals.[15]\n\n\nSpain won its first major international title when it hosted the 1964 European Nations' Cup held in Spain, defeating the Soviet Union 2–1 in the finals at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium.[16] The victory would stand as Spain's lone major title for 44 years. Spain was selected as host of the 1982 FIFA World Cup, reaching the second round and four years later they reached the quarter-finals before a penalty shootout defeat to Belgium.[17] Also at UEFA Euro 1984, they lost the final against France.[18] Spain reached the quarter-finals of the 1994 World Cup. The match became controversial when Italian defender Mauro Tassotti struck Luis Enrique with his elbow inside Spain's penalty area, causing Luis Enrique to bleed profusely from his nose and mouth, but the foul was not noticed nor sanctioned by referee Sándor Puhl. Had the official acknowledged the foul, Spain would have merited a penalty kick.[19] In the 2002 World Cup, Spain won its three group play matches, then defeated the Republic of Ireland on penalties in the second round. They faced co-hosts South Korea in the quarter-finals, losing in a shootout after having two goals controversially called back for alleged infractions during regular and extra time.[20]\n\n\n\n![](image)World Cup champions parade, celebrate as they pass in front of the Air Force Headquarters in Madrid.\nAt UEFA Euro 2008, Spain won all their games in Group D. Italy were the opponents in the quarter-finals match, which Spain won 4–2 on penalties. They then met Russia again in the semi-finals, beating them 3–0.[21] In the final, Spain defeated Germany 1–0, with Fernando Torres scoring the only goal of the game.[22] This was Spain's first major title since the 1964 European Championship. Xavi was awarded the player of the tournament.[nb 1] The following year the side finished third at the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup breaking their 35-match unbeaten streak that began in November 2006 after a loss to the United States.[23] In the 2010 World Cup, Spain advanced to the final for the first time ever by defeating Germany 1–0. In the decisive match against the Netherlands, Andrés Iniesta scored the match's only goal, coming in extra time. Spain became the third team to win a World Cup outside their own continent, and the first European team to do so. Goalkeeper Iker Casillas won the golden glove for only conceding two goals during the tournament, while David Villa won the bronze ball and silver boot, tied for top scorer of the tournament. Spain qualified top of Group I in qualification for UEFA Euro 2012 with a perfect 100% record.[5] They became the first team to retain the European Championship, winning the final 4–0 against Italy, while Fernando Torres won the Golden Boot for top scorer of the tournament.[24]\n\n\nSpain advanced to the final of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, losing to hosts Brazil,[25] and the following year they were eliminated from the group stage of the 2014 World Cup.[26] At Euro 2016 and the 2018 World Cup, the side reached the last 16 in both tournaments, losing to Italy 2–0 and Russia 3–2 on penalties after a 1–1 draw.[27][28] In the UEFA Euro 2020, held in 2021 after COVID-19 pandemic caused delays, Spain made a breakthrough, reaching the last four of a major tournament for the first time since 2012, before losing to eventual champions Italy 4–2 on penalties after a 1–1 draw. The team finished the tournament with two wins and four draws (including two penalty shootouts).[29] The same year they managed to reach the 2021 UEFA Nations League Final, losing against France.[30] In the 2022 World Cup, Spain finished second in their group, then in the round of 16, they lost to Morocco 3–0 on penalties after a 0–0 draw, to be the third consecutive elimination from a major tournament in penalty shootouts.[31]\n\n\n\n## Team image[edit]\n\n\n### Nicknames[edit]\n\n\nSpain's team is commonly known by fans as \"*La Furia Roja*\", meaning *the Red Fury* in Spanish.[1] recalling the \"Sack of Antwerp\" – an episode in the military history of Spain.[32] However, there are another unofficial nicknames to refer to the national team of Spain.\n\n\nThe other most common nickname, known by fans, is \"*Los Toros*\" (*Fighting Bulls*), since Spanish Fighting Bull is one of Spain's famous national treasures and often used to define Spanish culture, and also often depicted by Spanish supporters alike.[33] The Spain football team is sometimes referred as the Bulls due to this cultural heritage.[34]\n\n\nThe Spanish team also received other nicknames, mostly \"*Toreros*\" or \"*Matador*\" (*Bullfighters* in Spanish), to describe its passionate and romantic style of football playing.[35]\n\n\n\n### Style of play[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tiki-taka\n\n![](image)Spain, UEFA Euro 2008 winners\n![](image)Spain's players celebrate winning the 2010 FIFA World Cup\n![](image)Spain, UEFA Euro 2012 winners\nBetween 2008 and 2012, the team played a style of football dubbed 'tiki-taka', a systems approach to football founded upon the ideal of team unity and a comprehensive understanding in the geometry of space on a football field.[36]\n\n\nTiki-taka has been variously described as \"a style of play based on making your way to the back of the net through short passing and movement\",[37] a \"short passing style in which the ball is worked carefully through various channels\",[38] and a \"nonsensical phrase that has come to mean short passing, patience and possession above all else\".[39] The style involves roaming movement and positional interchange amongst midfielders, moving the ball in intricate patterns,[40] and sharp, one or two-touch passing.[41] Tiki-taka is \"both defensive and offensive in equal measure\" – the team is always in possession, so doesn't need to switch between defending and attacking.[42] Commentators have contrasted tiki-taka with \"Route One physicality\"[37] and with the higher-tempo passing of Barcelona and Arsène Wenger's 2007–08 Arsenal side, which employed Cesc Fàbregas as the only channel between defence and attack.[38] Tiki-taka is associated with flair, creativity, and touch,[43] but can also be taken to a \"slow, directionless extreme\" that sacrifices effectiveness for aesthetics.[39]\n\n\nTiki-taka was successfully employed by Spain to win Euro 2008, the 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012. The 2008–12 teams are regarded as being among the greatest of international teams in football history.[7][5][6]\n\n\n\n\n> They have the Barcelona \"carousel\" of Xavi and Andrés Iniesta augmented by Real Madrid's Xabi Alonso in midfield.\n> \n> — Phil McNulty of the BBC on the midfield players at the heart of Spain's tiki-taka passing style of play.[5]\n> \n\n\nSid Lowe identifies Luis Aragonés' tempering of tiki-taka with pragmatism as a key factor in Spain's success in Euro 2008. Aragonés used tiki-taka to \"protect a defense that appeared suspect [...], maintain possession and dominate games\" without taking the style to \"evangelical extremes\". None of Spain's first six goals in the tournament came from tiki-taka: five came from direct breaks and one from a set play.[39] For Lowe, Spain's success in the 2010 World Cup was evidence of the meeting of two traditions in Spanish football: the \"powerful, aggressive, direct\" style that earned the silver medal-winning 1920 Antwerp Olympic team the nickname *La Furia Roja* (\"The Red Fury\") and the tiki-taka style of the contemporary Spain's team, which focused on a collective, short-passing, technical and possession-based game.[44]\n\n\nAnalyzing Spain's semi-final victory over Germany at the 2010 World Cup, Raphael Honigstein described Spain's tiki-taka style as \"the most difficult version of football possible: an uncompromising passing game, coupled with intense, high pressing\". For Honigstein, tiki-taka is \"a significant upgrade\" of the Netherlands' Total Football because it relies on ball movement rather than players switching position. Tiki-taka allowed Spain to \"control both the ball and the opponent\".[42]\n\n\n\n\n> We have the same idea as each other. Keep the ball, create movement around and off the ball, get in the spaces to cause danger.\n> \n> — Xabi Alonso (Spanish midfielder).[41]\n> \n\n\n### Kits and crest[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Spain national football team kits.\n\nSpain's kit is traditionally a red jersey with yellow trim, dark blue shorts and black socks, whilst their current away kit is all predominantly white. The colour of the socks altered throughout the 1990s from black to the same blue colour as the shorts, matching either the blue of the shorts or the red of the shirt until the mid-2010s when they returned to their traditional black. Spain's kits have been produced by manufacturers including Adidas (from 1981 until 1983), Le Coq Sportif (from 1983 until 1991) and Adidas once again (since 1991). Rather than displaying the logo of the Spanish football federation, Spain's jersey traditionally features the country's coat of arms over the left side. After winning the 2010 World Cup, the World Cup winners badge was added to the right side of the jersey and a golden star at the top of Spain's coat of arms.\n\n\n\n#### Kit suppliers[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Kit supplier\n | Period\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| *None* | 1920–1935\n |  |\n| ![Spain](image) Deportes Cóndor\n | 1935–1966\n |  |\n| ![England](image) Umbro | 1966\n |  |\n| ![Spain](image) Deportes Cóndor\n | 1967–1981\n |  |\n| ![West Germany](image) Adidas | 1981–1983\n |  |\n| ![France](image) Le Coq Sportif | 1984–1990\n |  |\n| ![Germany](image) Adidas | 1991–present\n | Current until 2030[45][46] |\n\n\n### Home stadium[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of stadiums in Spain\n\nSpain does not have a designated national stadium. The capital city of Madrid (Bernabéu and Metropolitano), Seville (Pizjuán, La Cartuja and Villamarín), Valencia (Mestalla and Orriols) and Barcelona (Camp Nou and Montjuïc), are the four Spanish cities that have hosted more than 15 national team matches, while also being home to the largest stadiums in the country.[47]\n\n\nOther friendly matches, as well as qualifying fixtures against smaller opponents, are played in provincial stadia. The 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign included matches at the Reino de León in León,[48] Los Cármenes in Granada,[49] El Molinón in Gijón,[50] and the Rico Pérez in Alicante.[51]\n\n\n\n### Media coverage[edit]\n\n\nSpain's UEFA European Qualifiers and UEFA Nations League matches, and all friendly games from 2018 until 2022, will be televised nationwide by La 1, flagship television channel of the public broadcaster TVE.[52]\n\n\n\n## Rivalries[edit]\n\n\nSpain has four main rivalries with other top footballing nations.\n\n\n\n* Their rivalry with **Italy**, sometimes referred to as the *Mediterranean Derby*,[53] contested since 1920. Although the two nations are not immediate geographical neighbours, their rivalry at international level is enhanced by the strong performances of the representative clubs in UEFA competitions, in which they are among the leading associations and have each enjoyed spells of dominance.[54][55] Since the quarter-finals match between the two countries at Euro 2008, the rivalry has renewed, with its most notable match between the two sides being in the UEFA Euro 2012 Final, which Spain won 4–0.[56][57]\n* Their rivalry with **Portugal**, also known as the *Iberian Derby*, is one of the oldest football rivalries at a national level. It began on 18 December 1921, when Portugal lost 3–1 to Spain at Madrid in their first ever international friendly game. Portugal lost their first matches, with their first draw (2–2) only coming in 1926. Portugal's first win came much later (4–1) in 1947. Both belong to the strongest football nations of the world, and have met a total of 39 times (of which 9 matches were competitive) which resulted in 16 victories for Spain, 17 draws and 6 victories for Portugal.\n* Their rivalry with **France**, also another major football force, is also one of the oldest at a national level. Spain and France have met a total of 36 times, began with a 4–0 triumph for Spain in a friendly in Bordeaux on 30 April 1922, though their first competitive meeting came in the UEFA Euro 1984 Final, which France won to take over its first major international honours.[58][59] Spain has the advantage in head-to-head competition with 16 wins, 13 losses and 7 draws, though France has gotten more international glories than Spain.\n* Their rivalry with **Germany**, is also one of the oldest at a national level. Germany and Spain have faced each other 26 times, started with a 2–1 friendly victory for Spain on 12 May 1935 in Cologne. However, Spain only met Germany for the first time in any competitive fixture in 1966, as part of the 1966 FIFA World Cup, where Germany (known as West Germany at the time) came back to win 2–1.[60] However, since the unification of Germany in 1991, Spain has remained undefeated in competitive fixtures against Germany, including the famous 6–0 rout in the 2020–21 UEFA Nations League A.[61] Total head-to-head result however is slightly favourable for Germany with 9 wins, 9 draws compared to 8 wins by Spain.\n\n\n## Results and fixtures[edit]\n\n\nFor all past match results of the national team, see single-season articles, and Spain national football team results.\n\nFurther information: 2022–23 in Spanish football and 2023–24 in Spanish football\n\nThe following is a list of match results in the last 12 months, as well as any future matches that have been scheduled.\n\n\n  Win\n  Draw\n  Loss\n  Fixture\n\n\n\n### 2022[edit]\n\n\nSpain ![](image) v ![](image) Costa Rica\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 23 November 2022 2022 FIFA World Cup Group E |  **Spain ![](image)**  | **7–0** |  **![](image) Costa Rica**  | Doha, Qatar |\n| 19:00 UTC+3 | * Olmo ![](image) 11'\n* Asensio ![](image) 21'\n* Torres ![](image) 31' (pen.), 54'\n* Gavi ![](image) 74'\n* Soler ![](image) 90'\n* Morata ![](image) 90+2'\n | Report |  | Stadium: Al Thumama StadiumAttendance: 40,013Referee: Mohammed Abdulla Hassan Mohamed (United Arab Emirates) |\n\nSpain ![](image) v ![](image) Germany\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 27 November 2022 2022 FIFA World Cup Group E |  **Spain ![](image)**  | **1–1** |  **![](image) Germany**  | Al Khor, Qatar |\n| 22:00 UTC+3 | * Morata ![](image) 62'\n | Report | * Füllkrug ![](image) 83'\n | Stadium: Al-Bayt StadiumAttendance: 68,895Referee: Danny Makkelie (Netherlands) |\n\nJapan ![](image) v ![](image) Spain\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 December 2022 2022 FIFA World Cup Group E |  **Japan ![](image)**  | **2–1** |  **![](image) Spain**  | Al Rayyan, Qatar |\n| 22:00 UTC+3 | * Dōan ![](image) 48'\n* Tanaka ![](image) 51'\n | Report | * Morata ![](image) 11'\n | Stadium: Khalifa International StadiumAttendance: 44,851Referee: Victor Gomes (South Africa) |\n\nMorocco ![](image) v ![](image) Spain\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 6 December 2022 2022 FIFA World Cup R16 |  **Morocco ![](image)**  | **0–0** (a.e.t.)

World Cup[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Spain at the FIFA World Cup\n\nAlthough often entering tournaments as one of the favorites, Spain have often underachieved at the World Cup.[*citation needed*] Spain's first World Cup was in 1934. At that World Cup, Spain started their campaign by defeating Brazil 3–1 to advance to the quarter-finals, where they lost to hosts Italy. Before Spain's success in 2010, their best result came in 1950, where they reached the last four. Spain were paired with the hosts Brazil, as well as Uruguay and Sweden. Spain managed a draw against Uruguay but defeats from Brazil and Sweden meant that Spain would end up in fourth place. At the 2010 FIFA World Cup held in South Africa, Spain became world champions for the first time after defeating the Netherlands 1–0 in the final, becoming the eight country to win the World Cup and the first European team to lift the trophy outside of their continent. \n\n\n  **Champions**    **Runners-up**    **Third place**     Tournament played fully or partially on home soil  \n\n\n\n\n\n| FIFA World Cup record\n |  | Qualification record\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Year\n | Round\n | Position\n | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA |\n| ![Uruguay](image) 1930 | *Did not enter* | *Did not enter* |\n| ![Italy](image) 1934 | Quarter-finals\n | 5th\n | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | 4\n | 3\n | 2\n | 2\n | 0\n | 0\n | 11\n | 1\n |\n| ![France](image) 1938 | *Withdrew* | *Withdrew* |\n| ![Brazil](image) 1950 | **Fourth place** | **4th** | **6** | **3** | **1** | **2** | **10** | **12** | 2\n | 1\n | 1\n | 0\n | 7\n | 3\n |\n| ![Switzerland](image) 1954 | *Did not qualify* | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | 6\n | 4\n |\n| ![Sweden](image) 1958 | 4\n | 2\n | 1\n | 1\n | 12\n | 8\n |\n| ![Chile](image) 1962 | Group stage\n | 13th\n | 3\n | 1\n | 0\n | 2\n | 2\n | 3\n | 4\n | 3\n | 1\n | 0\n | 7\n | 4\n |\n| ![England](image) 1966 | 10th\n | 3\n | 1\n | 0\n | 2\n | 4\n | 5\n | 3\n | 2\n | 0\n | 1\n | 5\n | 2\n |\n| ![Mexico](image) 1970 | *Did not qualify* | 6\n | 2\n | 2\n | 2\n | 10\n | 6\n |\n| ![West Germany](image) 1974 | 5\n | 2\n | 2\n | 1\n | 8\n | 6\n |\n| ![Argentina](image) 1978 | Group stage\n | 10th\n | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | 2\n | 2\n | 4\n | 3\n | 0\n | 1\n | 4\n | 1\n |\n| ![Spain](image) 1982 | Second group stage\n | 12th\n | 5\n | 1\n | 2\n | 2\n | 4\n | 5\n | *Qualified as host* |\n| ![Mexico](image) 1986 | Quarter-finals\n | 7th\n | 5\n | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 11\n | 4\n | 6\n | 4\n | 0\n | 2\n | 9\n | 8\n |\n| ![Italy](image) 1990 | Round of 16\n | 10th\n | 4\n | 2\n | 1\n | 1\n | 6\n | 4\n | 8\n | 6\n | 1\n | 1\n | 20\n | 3\n |\n| ![United States](image) 1994 | Quarter-finals\n | 8th\n | 5\n | 2\n | 2\n | 1\n | 10\n | 6\n | 12\n | 8\n | 3\n | 1\n | 27\n | 4\n |\n| ![France](image) 1998 | Group stage\n | 17th\n | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | 8\n | 4\n | 10\n | 8\n | 2\n | 0\n | 26\n | 6\n |\n| ![South Korea](image) ![Japan](image) 2002 | Quarter-finals\n | 5th\n | 5\n | 3\n | 2\n | 0\n | 10\n | 5\n | 8\n | 6\n | 2\n | 0\n | 21\n | 4\n |\n| ![Germany](image) 2006 | Round of 16\n | 9th\n | 4\n | 3\n | 0\n | 1\n | 9\n | 4\n | 12\n | 6\n | 6\n | 0\n | 25\n | 5\n |\n| ![South Africa](image) 2010 | **Champions** | **1st** | **7** | **6** | **0** | **1** | **8** | **2** | 10\n | 10\n | 0\n | 0\n | 28\n | 5\n |\n| ![Brazil](image) 2014 | Group stage\n | 23rd\n | 3\n | 1\n | 0\n | 2\n | 4\n | 7\n | 8\n | 6\n | 2\n | 0\n | 14\n | 3\n |\n| ![Russia](image) 2018 | Round of 16\n | 10th\n | 4\n | 1\n | 3\n | 0\n | 7\n | 6\n | 10\n | 9\n | 1\n | 0\n | 36\n | 3\n |\n| ![Qatar](image) 2022 | 13th\n | 4\n | 1\n | 2\n | 1\n | 9\n | 3\n | 8\n | 6\n | 1\n | 1\n | 15\n | 5\n |\n| ![Canada](image) ![Mexico](image) ![United States](image) 2026 | *To be determined* | *To be determined* |\n| ![Morocco](image) ![Portugal](image) ![Spain](image)\n![Argentina](image)\n![Paraguay](image)\n![Uruguay](image) 2030\n | *Qualified as co-hosts* | *Qualified as co-hosts* |\n| ![Saudi Arabia](image) 2034 | *To be determined* | *To be determined* |\n| Total\n | 1 Title\n | 16/22\n | 67\n | 31\n | 17\n | 19\n | 108\n | 75\n | 125\n | 87\n | 26\n | 12\n | 291\n | 81\n |\n\n\n\n\n| **Spain's World Cup record** |\n| --- |\n| First match\n | ![](image) Spain 3–1 Brazil ![](image)(27 May 1934; Genoa, Italy)\n |\n| Biggest win\n | ![](image) Spain 7–0 Costa Rica ![](image)(23 November 2022; Doha, Qatar)\n |\n| Biggest defeat\n | ![](image) Brazil 6–1 Spain ![](image)(13 July 1950; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil)\n |\n| Best result\n | **Champions** in 2010 |\n| Worst result\n | Group Stage in 1962, 1966, 1978, 1998, 2014 |\n\n\n### UEFA European Championship[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Spain at the UEFA European Championship\n\nSpain have won the joint most UEFA European Championships, along with Germany (3 titles). La Roja are the only nation to date to have won consecutive championships. They have hosted the tournament once, in 1964 (one city was used to host games at Euro 2020) and have appeared in a total of 11 tournaments. \n\n\nThe team won their first international trophy on home soil in 1964, defeating the Soviet Union 2–1. Spain would reach the final twenty years later in 1984, where they would lose the final to France. Spain would not reach the final again until 2008, where they would defeat Germany 1–0. Four years later, Spain earned back-to-back titles, comprehensively defeating Italy 4–0 in the final in Kiev.\n\n\n\n\n\n| UEFA European Championship record\n |  | Qualifying record\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Year\n | Round\n | Position\n | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA |\n| ![France](image) 1960 | *Withdrew* | 2\n | 2\n | 0\n | 0\n | 7\n | 2\n |\n| ![Spain](image) 1964 | **Champions** | **1st** | **2** | **2** | **0** | **0** | **4** | **2** | 6\n | 4\n | 1\n | 1\n | 16\n | 5\n |\n| ![Italy](image) 1968 | *Did not qualify* | 8\n | 3\n | 2\n | 3\n | 7\n | 5\n |\n| ![Belgium](image) 1972 | 6\n | 3\n | 2\n | 1\n | 14\n | 3\n |\n| ![Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia](image) 1976 | 8\n | 3\n | 4\n | 1\n | 11\n | 9\n |\n| ![Italy](image) 1980 | Group stage\n | 7th\n | 3\n | 0\n | 1\n | 2\n | 2\n | 4\n | 6\n | 4\n | 1\n | 1\n | 13\n | 5\n |\n| ![France](image) 1984 | **Runners-up** | **2nd** | **5** | **1** | **3** | **1** | **4** | **5** | 8\n | 6\n | 1\n | 1\n | 24\n | 8\n |\n| ![West Germany](image) 1988 | Group stage\n | 6th\n | 3\n | 1\n | 0\n | 2\n | 3\n | 5\n | 6\n | 5\n | 0\n | 1\n | 14\n | 6\n |\n| ![Sweden](image) 1992 | *Did not qualify* | 7\n | 3\n | 0\n | 4\n | 17\n | 12\n |\n| ![England](image) 1996 | Quarter-finals\n | 6th\n | 4\n | 1\n | 3\n | 0\n | 4\n | 3\n | 10\n | 8\n | 2\n | 0\n | 25\n | 4\n |\n| ![Belgium](image) ![Netherlands](image) 2000 | 5th\n | 4\n | 2\n | 0\n | 2\n | 7\n | 7\n | 8\n | 7\n | 0\n | 1\n | 42\n | 5\n |\n| ![Portugal](image) 2004 | Group stage\n | 10th\n | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | 2\n | 2\n | 10\n | 7\n | 2\n | 1\n | 21\n | 5\n |\n| ![Austria](image) ![Switzerland](image) 2008 | **Champions** | **1st** | **6** | **5** | **1** | **0** | **12** | **3** | 12\n | 9\n | 1\n | 2\n | 23\n | 8\n |\n| ![Poland](image) ![Ukraine](image) 2012 | **Champions** | **1st** | **6** | **4** | **2** | **0** | **12** | **1** | 8\n | 8\n | 0\n | 0\n | 26\n | 6\n |\n| ![France](image) 2016 | Round of 16\n | 10th\n | 4\n | 2\n | 0\n | 2\n | 5\n | 4\n | 10\n | 9\n | 0\n | 1\n | 23\n | 3\n |\n| ![Europe](image) 2020 | **Semi-finals** | **3rd** | **6** | **2** | **4** | **0** | **13** | **6** | 10\n | 8\n | 2\n | 0\n | 31\n | 5\n |\n| ![Germany](image) 2024 | *Qualified* | 8\n | 7\n | 0\n | 1\n | 25\n | 5\n |\n| ![United Kingdom](image) ![Republic of Ireland](image) 2028 | *To be determined* |\n| ![Italy](image) ![Turkey](image) 2032 |\n| Total\n | 3 Titles\n | 12/17\n | 46\n | 21\n | 15\n | 10\n | 68\n | 42\n | 128\n | 91\n | 18\n | 19\n | 320\n | 94\n |\n\n\n\n\n| **Spain's European Championship record** |\n| --- |\n| First match\n | ![](image) Spain 2–1 Hungary ![](image)(Madrid, Spain; 17 June 1964)\n |\n| Biggest win\n | ![](image) Spain 5–0 Slovakia ![](image)(Seville, Spain; 23 June 2021)\n |\n| Biggest defeat\n | ![](image) France 2–0 Spain ![](image)(Paris, France; 27 June 1984)![](image) West Germany 2–0 Spain ![](image)(Munich, West Germany; 17 June 1988)![](image) Italy 2–0 Spain ![](image) (Saint-Denis, France; 27 June 2016)\n |\n| Best result\n | **Champions** in 1964, 2008, 2012 |\n| Worst result\n | Group stage in 1980, 1988, 2004 |\n\n\n### UEFA Nations League[edit]\n\n\nSince the inaugural UEFA Nations League, La Roja have remained in League A and have reached the UEFA Nations League Finals on two occasions.

It is governed by the Royal Spanish Football Federation, the governing body for football in Spain.\n\n\nSpain is one of eight national teams to have been crowned world champions and have participated in a total of 16 of 22 FIFA World Cups, also qualifying consistently since 1978. Spain have won three continental titles during their appearances of 11 out of 16 UEFA European Championships. Spain currently competes in League A of the UEFA Nations League alongside the other top teams of Europe. Their best result was in the 2022–23 season where they reached the final, winning against Croatia.\n\n\nSpain's achievements from 2008–2012 have led many experts and commentators to consider this era's Spain squads one of the best ever teams in football history.[5][6][7][8][9] During this period, Spain became the only national team to win three consecutive major titles, including two back-to-back European Championships in 2008 and 2012, while becoming the first European team to win a World Cup held outside of Europe in 2010.[10] From 2008 to 2013, Spain won the FIFA Team of the Year, the second-most of any nation, behind only Brazil.[11] From the start of 2007 to the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup, Spain achieved 35 consecutive undefeated matches, a feat which they shared with Brazil, and a sport record at the time. Spain along with France are the only two European countries to have won the triplete (World Cup, Euro, Nations League).\nSpain is one of only two nations to have won both the FIFA World Cup and the FIFA Women's World Cup (the other being Germany).\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: History of the Spain national football team\n\n![](image)Spain national football team in the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp\nSpain has been a member of FIFA since its founding in 1904, even though the Spanish Football Federation was first established in 1909. The first Spain national football team was constituted in 1920, with the main objective of finding a team that would represent Spain at the 1920 Summer Olympics held in Belgium in that same year. Spain made their debut at the tournament on 28 August 1920 against Denmark, silver medalists at the last two Olympic tournaments. Spain managed to win that match by a scoreline of 1–0, eventually finishing with the silver medal.[12] Spain qualified for their first FIFA World Cup in 1934, defeating Brazil in their first game and losing in a replay to the hosts and eventual champions Italy in the quarter-finals.[13] The Spanish Civil War and World War II prevented Spain from playing any competitive matches between the 1934 World Cup and the 1950 edition's qualifiers. At the 1950 finals in Brazil, they topped their group to progress to the finals round, then finished in fourth place.[14] Until 2010, this had been Spain's highest finish in a FIFA World Cup finals.[15]\n\n\nSpain won its first major international title when it hosted the 1964 European Nations' Cup held in Spain, defeating the Soviet Union 2–1 in the finals at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium.[16] The victory would stand as Spain's lone major title for 44 years. Spain was selected as host of the 1982 FIFA World Cup, reaching the second round and four years later they reached the quarter-finals before a penalty shootout defeat to Belgium.[17] Also at UEFA Euro 1984, they lost the final against France.[18] Spain reached the quarter-finals of the 1994 World Cup. The match became controversial when Italian defender Mauro Tassotti struck Luis Enrique with his elbow inside Spain's penalty area, causing Luis Enrique to bleed profusely from his nose and mouth, but the foul was not noticed nor sanctioned by referee Sándor Puhl. Had the official acknowledged the foul, Spain would have merited a penalty kick.[19] In the 2002 World Cup, Spain won its three group play matches, then defeated the Republic of Ireland on penalties in the second round. They faced co-hosts South Korea in the quarter-finals, losing in a shootout after having two goals controversially called back for alleged infractions during regular and extra time.[20]\n\n\n\n![](image)World Cup champions parade, celebrate as they pass in front of the Air Force Headquarters in Madrid.\nAt UEFA Euro 2008, Spain won all their games in Group D. Italy were the opponents in the quarter-finals match, which Spain won 4–2 on penalties. They then met Russia again in the semi-finals, beating them 3–0.[21] In the final, Spain defeated Germany 1–0, with Fernando Torres scoring the only goal of the game.[22] This was Spain's first major title since the 1964 European Championship. Xavi was awarded the player of the tournament.[nb 1] The following year the side finished third at the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup breaking their 35-match unbeaten streak that began in November 2006 after a loss to the United States.[23] In the 2010 World Cup, Spain advanced to the final for the first time ever by defeating Germany 1–0. In the decisive match against the Netherlands, Andrés Iniesta scored the match's only goal, coming in extra time. Spain became the third team to win a World Cup outside their own continent, and the first European team to do so. Goalkeeper Iker Casillas won the golden glove for only conceding two goals during the tournament, while David Villa won the bronze ball and silver boot, tied for top scorer of the tournament. Spain qualified top of Group I in qualification for UEFA Euro 2012 with a perfect 100% record.[5] They became the first team to retain the European Championship, winning the final 4–0 against Italy, while Fernando Torres won the Golden Boot for top scorer of the tournament.[24]\n\n\nSpain advanced to the final of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, losing to hosts Brazil,[25] and the following year they were eliminated from the group stage of the 2014 World Cup.[26] At Euro 2016 and the 2018 World Cup, the side reached the last 16 in both tournaments, losing to Italy 2–0 and Russia 3–2 on penalties after a 1–1 draw.[27][28] In the UEFA Euro 2020, held in 2021 after COVID-19 pandemic caused delays, Spain made a breakthrough, reaching the last four of a major tournament for the first time since 2012, before losing to eventual champions Italy 4–2 on penalties after a 1–1 draw. The team finished the tournament with two wins and four draws (including two penalty shootouts).[29] The same year they managed to reach the 2021 UEFA Nations League Final, losing against France.[30] In the 2022 World Cup, Spain finished second in their group, then in the round of 16, they lost to Morocco 3–0 on penalties after a 0–0 draw, to be the third consecutive elimination from a major tournament in penalty shootouts.[31]\n\n\n\n## Team image[edit]\n\n\n### Nicknames[edit]\n\n\nSpain's team is commonly known by fans as \"*La Furia Roja*\", meaning *the Red Fury* in Spanish.[1] recalling the \"Sack of Antwerp\" – an episode in the military history of Spain.[32] However, there are another unofficial nicknames to refer to the national team of Spain.\n\n\nThe other most common nickname, known by fans, is \"*Los Toros*\" (*Fighting Bulls*), since Spanish Fighting Bull is one of Spain's famous national treasures and often used to define Spanish culture, and also often depicted by Spanish supporters alike.[33] The Spain football team is sometimes referred as the Bulls due to this cultural heritage.[34]\n\n\nThe Spanish team also received other nicknames, mostly \"*Toreros*\" or \"*Matador*\" (*Bullfighters* in Spanish), to describe its passionate and romantic style of football playing.[35]\n\n\n\n### Style of play[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tiki-taka\n\n![](image)Spain, UEFA Euro 2008 winners\n![](image)Spain's players celebrate winning the 2010 FIFA World Cup\n![](image)Spain, UEFA Euro 2012 winners\nBetween 2008 and 2012, the team played a style of football dubbed 'tiki-taka', a systems approach to football founded upon the ideal of team unity and a comprehensive understanding in the geometry of space on a football field.[36]\n\n\nTiki-taka has been variously described as \"a style of play based on making your way to the back of the net through short passing and movement\",[37] a \"short passing style in which the ball is worked carefully through various channels\",[38] and a \"nonsensical phrase that has come to mean short passing, patience and possession above all else\".[39] The style involves roaming movement and positional interchange amongst midfielders, moving the ball in intricate patterns,[40] and sharp, one or two-touch passing.[41] Tiki-taka is \"both defensive and offensive in equal measure\" – the team is always in possession, so doesn't need to switch between defending and attacking.[42] Commentators have contrasted tiki-taka with \"Route One physicality\"[37] and with the higher-tempo passing of Barcelona and Arsène Wenger's 2007–08 Arsenal side, which employed Cesc Fàbregas as the only channel between defence and attack.[38] Tiki-taka is associated with flair, creativity, and touch,[43] but can also be taken to a \"slow, directionless extreme\" that sacrifices effectiveness for aesthetics.[39]\n\n\nTiki-taka was successfully employed by Spain to win Euro 2008, the 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012. The 2008–12 teams are regarded as being among the greatest of international teams in football history.[7][5][6]\n\n\n\n\n> They have the Barcelona \"carousel\" of Xavi and Andrés Iniesta augmented by Real Madrid's Xabi Alonso in midfield.\n> \n> — Phil McNulty of the BBC on the midfield players at the heart of Spain's tiki-taka passing style of play.[5]\n> \n\n\nSid Lowe identifies Luis Aragonés' tempering of tiki-taka with pragmatism as a key factor in Spain's success in Euro 2008. Aragonés used tiki-taka to \"protect a defense that appeared suspect [...], maintain possession and dominate games\" without taking the style to \"evangelical extremes\". None of Spain's first six goals in the tournament came from tiki-taka: five came from direct breaks and one from a set play.[39] For Lowe, Spain's success in the 2010 World Cup was evidence of the meeting of two traditions in Spanish football: the \"powerful, aggressive, direct\" style that earned the silver medal-winning 1920 Antwerp Olympic team the nickname *La Furia Roja* (\"The Red Fury\") and the tiki-taka style of the contemporary Spain's team, which focused on a collective, short-passing, technical and possession-based game.[44]\n\n\nAnalyzing Spain's semi-final victory over Germany at the 2010 World Cup, Raphael Honigstein described Spain's tiki-taka style as \"the most difficult version of football possible: an uncompromising passing game, coupled with intense, high pressing\". For Honigstein, tiki-taka is \"a significant upgrade\" of the Netherlands' Total Football because it relies on ball movement rather than players switching position. Tiki-taka allowed Spain to \"control both the ball and the opponent\".[42]\n\n\n\n\n> We have the same idea as each other. Keep the ball, create movement around and off the ball, get in the spaces to cause danger.\n> \n> — Xabi Alonso (Spanish midfielder).[41]\n> \n\n\n### Kits and crest[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Spain national football team kits.\n\nSpain's kit is traditionally a red jersey with yellow trim, dark blue shorts and black socks, whilst their current away kit is all predominantly white. The colour of the socks altered throughout the 1990s from black to the same blue colour as the shorts, matching either the blue of the shorts or the red of the shirt until the mid-2010s when they returned to their traditional black. Spain's kits have been produced by manufacturers including Adidas (from 1981 until 1983), Le Coq Sportif (from 1983 until 1991) and Adidas once again (since 1991). Rather than displaying the logo of the Spanish football federation, Spain's jersey traditionally features the country's coat of arms over the left side. After winning the 2010 World Cup, the World Cup winners badge was added to the right side of the jersey and a golden star at the top of Spain's coat of arms.\n\n\n\n#### Kit suppliers[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Kit supplier\n | Period\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| *None* | 1920–1935\n |  |\n| ![Spain](image) Deportes Cóndor\n | 1935–1966\n |  |\n| ![England](image) Umbro | 1966\n |  |\n| ![Spain](image) Deportes Cóndor\n | 1967–1981\n |  |\n| ![West Germany](image) Adidas | 1981–1983\n |  |\n| ![France](image) Le Coq Sportif | 1984–1990\n |  |\n| ![Germany](image) Adidas | 1991–present\n | Current until 2030[45][46] |\n\n\n### Home stadium[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of stadiums in Spain\n\nSpain does not have a designated national stadium. The capital city of Madrid (Bernabéu and Metropolitano), Seville (Pizjuán, La Cartuja and Villamarín), Valencia (Mestalla and Orriols) and Barcelona (Camp Nou and Montjuïc), are the four Spanish cities that have hosted more than 15 national team matches, while also being home to the largest stadiums in the country.[47]\n\n\nOther friendly matches, as well as qualifying fixtures against smaller opponents, are played in provincial stadia. The 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign included matches at the Reino de León in León,[48] Los Cármenes in Granada,[49] El Molinón in Gijón,[50] and the Rico Pérez in Alicante.[51]\n\n\n\n### Media coverage[edit]\n\n\nSpain's UEFA European Qualifiers and UEFA Nations League matches, and all friendly games from 2018 until 2022, will be televised nationwide by La 1, flagship television channel of the public broadcaster TVE.[52]\n\n\n\n## Rivalries[edit]\n\n\nSpain has four main rivalries with other top footballing nations.\n\n\n\n* Their rivalry with **Italy**, sometimes referred to as the *Mediterranean Derby*,[53] contested since 1920. Although the two nations are not immediate geographical neighbours, their rivalry at international level is enhanced by the strong performances of the representative clubs in UEFA competitions, in which they are among the leading associations and have each enjoyed spells of dominance.[54][55] Since the quarter-finals match between the two countries at Euro 2008, the rivalry has renewed, with its most notable match between the two sides being in the UEFA Euro 2012 Final, which Spain won 4–0.[56][57]\n* Their rivalry with **Portugal**, also known as the *Iberian Derby*, is one of the oldest football rivalries at a national level. It began on 18 December 1921, when Portugal lost 3–1 to Spain at Madrid in their first ever international friendly game. Portugal lost their first matches, with their first draw (2–2) only coming in 1926. Portugal's first win came much later (4–1) in 1947. Both belong to the strongest football nations of the world, and have met a total of 39 times (of which 9 matches were competitive) which resulted in 16 victories for Spain, 17 draws and 6 victories for Portugal.\n* Their rivalry with **France**, also another major football force, is also one of the oldest at a national level. Spain and France have met a total of 36 times, began with a 4–0 triumph for Spain in a friendly in Bordeaux on 30 April 1922, though their first competitive meeting came in the UEFA Euro 1984 Final, which France won to take over its first major international honours.[58][59] Spain has the advantage in head-to-head competition with 16 wins, 13 losses and 7 draws, though France has gotten more international glories than Spain.\n* Their rivalry with **Germany**, is also one of the oldest at a national level. Germany and Spain have faced each other 26 times, started with a 2–1 friendly victory for Spain on 12 May 1935 in Cologne. However, Spain only met Germany for the first time in any competitive fixture in 1966, as part of the 1966 FIFA World Cup, where Germany (known as West Germany at the time) came back to win 2–1.[60] However, since the unification of Germany in 1991, Spain has remained undefeated in competitive fixtures against Germany, including the famous 6–0 rout in the 2020–21 UEFA Nations League A.[61] Total head-to-head result however is slightly favourable for Germany with 9 wins, 9 draws compared to 8 wins by Spain.\n\n\n## Results and fixtures[edit]\n\n\nFor all past match results of the national team, see single-season articles, and Spain national football team results.\n\nFurther information: 2022–23 in Spanish football and 2023–24 in Spanish football\n\nThe following is a list of match results in the last 12 months, as well as any future matches that have been scheduled.\n\n\n  Win\n  Draw\n  Loss\n  Fixture\n\n\n\n### 2022[edit]\n\n\nSpain ![](image) v ![](image) Costa Rica\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 23 November 2022 2022 FIFA World Cup Group E |  **Spain ![](image)**  | **7–0** |  **![](image) Costa Rica**  | Doha, Qatar |\n| 19:00 UTC+3 | * Olmo ![](image) 11'\n* Asensio ![](image) 21'\n* Torres ![](image) 31' (pen.), 54'\n* Gavi ![](image) 74'\n* Soler ![](image) 90'\n* Morata ![](image) 90+2'\n | Report |  | Stadium: Al Thumama StadiumAttendance: 40,013Referee: Mohammed Abdulla Hassan Mohamed (United Arab Emirates) |\n\nSpain ![](image) v ![](image) Germany\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 27 November 2022 2022 FIFA World Cup Group E |  **Spain ![](image)**  | **1–1** |  **![](image) Germany**  | Al Khor, Qatar |\n| 22:00 UTC+3 | * Morata ![](image) 62'\n | Report | * Füllkrug ![](image) 83'\n | Stadium: Al-Bayt StadiumAttendance: 68,895Referee: Danny Makkelie (Netherlands) |\n\nJapan ![](image) v ![](image) Spain\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 December 2022 2022 FIFA World Cup Group E |  **Japan ![](image)**  | **2–1** |  **![](image) Spain**  | Al Rayyan, Qatar |\n| 22:00 UTC+3 | * Dōan ![](image) 48'\n* Tanaka ![](image) 51'\n | Report | * Morata ![](image) 11'\n | Stadium: Khalifa International StadiumAttendance: 44,851Referee: Victor Gomes (South Africa) |\n\nMorocco ![](image) v ![](image) Spain\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 6 December 2022 2022 FIFA World Cup R16 |  **Morocco ![](image)**  | **0–0** (a.e.t.)

World Cup[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Spain at the FIFA World Cup\n\nAlthough often entering tournaments as one of the favorites, Spain have often underachieved at the World Cup.[*citation needed*] Spain's first World Cup was in 1934. At that World Cup, Spain started their campaign by defeating Brazil 3–1 to advance to the quarter-finals, where they lost to hosts Italy. Before Spain's success in 2010, their best result came in 1950, where they reached the last four. Spain were paired with the hosts Brazil, as well as Uruguay and Sweden. Spain managed a draw against Uruguay but defeats from Brazil and Sweden meant that Spain would end up in fourth place. At the 2010 FIFA World Cup held in South Africa, Spain became world champions for the first time after defeating the Netherlands 1–0 in the final, becoming the eight country to win the World Cup and the first European team to lift the trophy outside of their continent. \n\n\n  **Champions**    **Runners-up**    **Third place**     Tournament played fully or partially on home soil  \n\n\n\n\n\n| FIFA World Cup record\n |  | Qualification record\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Year\n | Round\n | Position\n | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA |\n| ![Uruguay](image) 1930 | *Did not enter* | *Did not enter* |\n| ![Italy](image) 1934 | Quarter-finals\n | 5th\n | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | 4\n | 3\n | 2\n | 2\n | 0\n | 0\n | 11\n | 1\n |\n| ![France](image) 1938 | *Withdrew* | *Withdrew* |\n| ![Brazil](image) 1950 | **Fourth place** | **4th** | **6** | **3** | **1** | **2** | **10** | **12** | 2\n | 1\n | 1\n | 0\n | 7\n | 3\n |\n| ![Switzerland](image) 1954 | *Did not qualify* | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | 6\n | 4\n |\n| ![Sweden](image) 1958 | 4\n | 2\n | 1\n | 1\n | 12\n | 8\n |\n| ![Chile](image) 1962 | Group stage\n | 13th\n | 3\n | 1\n | 0\n | 2\n | 2\n | 3\n | 4\n | 3\n | 1\n | 0\n | 7\n | 4\n |\n| ![England](image) 1966 | 10th\n | 3\n | 1\n | 0\n | 2\n | 4\n | 5\n | 3\n | 2\n | 0\n | 1\n | 5\n | 2\n |\n| ![Mexico](image) 1970 | *Did not qualify* | 6\n | 2\n | 2\n | 2\n | 10\n | 6\n |\n| ![West Germany](image) 1974 | 5\n | 2\n | 2\n | 1\n | 8\n | 6\n |\n| ![Argentina](image) 1978 | Group stage\n | 10th\n | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | 2\n | 2\n | 4\n | 3\n | 0\n | 1\n | 4\n | 1\n |\n| ![Spain](image) 1982 | Second group stage\n | 12th\n | 5\n | 1\n | 2\n | 2\n | 4\n | 5\n | *Qualified as host* |\n| ![Mexico](image) 1986 | Quarter-finals\n | 7th\n | 5\n | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 11\n | 4\n | 6\n | 4\n | 0\n | 2\n | 9\n | 8\n |\n| ![Italy](image) 1990 | Round of 16\n | 10th\n | 4\n | 2\n | 1\n | 1\n | 6\n | 4\n | 8\n | 6\n | 1\n | 1\n | 20\n | 3\n |\n| ![United States](image) 1994 | Quarter-finals\n | 8th\n | 5\n | 2\n | 2\n | 1\n | 10\n | 6\n | 12\n | 8\n | 3\n | 1\n | 27\n | 4\n |\n| ![France](image) 1998 | Group stage\n | 17th\n | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | 8\n | 4\n | 10\n | 8\n | 2\n | 0\n | 26\n | 6\n |\n| ![South Korea](image) ![Japan](image) 2002 | Quarter-finals\n | 5th\n | 5\n | 3\n | 2\n | 0\n | 10\n | 5\n | 8\n | 6\n | 2\n | 0\n | 21\n | 4\n |\n| ![Germany](image) 2006 | Round of 16\n | 9th\n | 4\n | 3\n | 0\n | 1\n | 9\n | 4\n | 12\n | 6\n | 6\n | 0\n | 25\n | 5\n |\n| ![South Africa](image) 2010 | **Champions** | **1st** | **7** | **6** | **0** | **1** | **8** | **2** | 10\n | 10\n | 0\n | 0\n | 28\n | 5\n |\n| ![Brazil](image) 2014 | Group stage\n | 23rd\n | 3\n | 1\n | 0\n | 2\n | 4\n | 7\n | 8\n | 6\n | 2\n | 0\n | 14\n | 3\n |\n| ![Russia](image) 2018 | Round of 16\n | 10th\n | 4\n | 1\n | 3\n | 0\n | 7\n | 6\n | 10\n | 9\n | 1\n | 0\n | 36\n | 3\n |\n| ![Qatar](image) 2022 | 13th\n | 4\n | 1\n | 2\n | 1\n | 9\n | 3\n | 8\n | 6\n | 1\n | 1\n | 15\n | 5\n |\n| ![Canada](image) ![Mexico](image) ![United States](image) 2026 | *To be determined* | *To be determined* |\n| ![Morocco](image) ![Portugal](image) ![Spain](image)\n![Argentina](image)\n![Paraguay](image)\n![Uruguay](image) 2030\n | *Qualified as co-hosts* | *Qualified as co-hosts* |\n| ![Saudi Arabia](image) 2034 | *To be determined* | *To be determined* |\n| Total\n | 1 Title\n | 16/22\n | 67\n | 31\n | 17\n | 19\n | 108\n | 75\n | 125\n | 87\n | 26\n | 12\n | 291\n | 81\n |\n\n\n\n\n| **Spain's World Cup record** |\n| --- |\n| First match\n | ![](image) Spain 3–1 Brazil ![](image)(27 May 1934; Genoa, Italy)\n |\n| Biggest win\n | ![](image) Spain 7–0 Costa Rica ![](image)(23 November 2022; Doha, Qatar)\n |\n| Biggest defeat\n | ![](image) Brazil 6–1 Spain ![](image)(13 July 1950; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil)\n |\n| Best result\n | **Champions** in 2010 |\n| Worst result\n | Group Stage in 1962, 1966, 1978, 1998, 2014 |\n\n\n### UEFA European Championship[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Spain at the UEFA European Championship\n\nSpain have won the joint most UEFA European Championships, along with Germany (3 titles). La Roja are the only nation to date to have won consecutive championships. They have hosted the tournament once, in 1964 (one city was used to host games at Euro 2020) and have appeared in a total of 11 tournaments. \n\n\nThe team won their first international trophy on home soil in 1964, defeating the Soviet Union 2–1. Spain would reach the final twenty years later in 1984, where they would lose the final to France. Spain would not reach the final again until 2008, where they would defeat Germany 1–0. Four years later, Spain earned back-to-back titles, comprehensively defeating Italy 4–0 in the final in Kiev.\n\n\n\n\n\n| UEFA European Championship record\n |  | Qualifying record\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Year\n | Round\n | Position\n | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA |\n| ![France](image) 1960 | *Withdrew* | 2\n | 2\n | 0\n | 0\n | 7\n | 2\n |\n| ![Spain](image) 1964 | **Champions** | **1st** | **2** | **2** | **0** | **0** | **4** | **2** | 6\n | 4\n | 1\n | 1\n | 16\n | 5\n |\n| ![Italy](image) 1968 | *Did not qualify* | 8\n | 3\n | 2\n | 3\n | 7\n | 5\n |\n| ![Belgium](image) 1972 | 6\n | 3\n | 2\n | 1\n | 14\n | 3\n |\n| ![Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia](image) 1976 | 8\n | 3\n | 4\n | 1\n | 11\n | 9\n |\n| ![Italy](image) 1980 | Group stage\n | 7th\n | 3\n | 0\n | 1\n | 2\n | 2\n | 4\n | 6\n | 4\n | 1\n | 1\n | 13\n | 5\n |\n| ![France](image) 1984 | **Runners-up** | **2nd** | **5** | **1** | **3** | **1** | **4** | **5** | 8\n | 6\n | 1\n | 1\n | 24\n | 8\n |\n| ![West Germany](image) 1988 | Group stage\n | 6th\n | 3\n | 1\n | 0\n | 2\n | 3\n | 5\n | 6\n | 5\n | 0\n | 1\n | 14\n | 6\n |\n| ![Sweden](image) 1992 | *Did not qualify* | 7\n | 3\n | 0\n | 4\n | 17\n | 12\n |\n| ![England](image) 1996 | Quarter-finals\n | 6th\n | 4\n | 1\n | 3\n | 0\n | 4\n | 3\n | 10\n | 8\n | 2\n | 0\n | 25\n | 4\n |\n| ![Belgium](image) ![Netherlands](image) 2000 | 5th\n | 4\n | 2\n | 0\n | 2\n | 7\n | 7\n | 8\n | 7\n | 0\n | 1\n | 42\n | 5\n |\n| ![Portugal](image) 2004 | Group stage\n | 10th\n | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | 2\n | 2\n | 10\n | 7\n | 2\n | 1\n | 21\n | 5\n |\n| ![Austria](image) ![Switzerland](image) 2008 | **Champions** | **1st** | **6** | **5** | **1** | **0** | **12** | **3** | 12\n | 9\n | 1\n | 2\n | 23\n | 8\n |\n| ![Poland](image) ![Ukraine](image) 2012 | **Champions** | **1st** | **6** | **4** | **2** | **0** | **12** | **1** | 8\n | 8\n | 0\n | 0\n | 26\n | 6\n |\n| ![France](image) 2016 | Round of 16\n | 10th\n | 4\n | 2\n | 0\n | 2\n | 5\n | 4\n | 10\n | 9\n | 0\n | 1\n | 23\n | 3\n |\n| ![Europe](image) 2020 | **Semi-finals** | **3rd** | **6** | **2** | **4** | **0** | **13** | **6** | 10\n | 8\n | 2\n | 0\n | 31\n | 5\n |\n| ![Germany](image) 2024 | *Qualified* | 8\n | 7\n | 0\n | 1\n | 25\n | 5\n |\n| ![United Kingdom](image) ![Republic of Ireland](image) 2028 | *To be determined* |\n| ![Italy](image) ![Turkey](image) 2032 |\n| Total\n | 3 Titles\n | 12/17\n | 46\n | 21\n | 15\n | 10\n | 68\n | 42\n | 128\n | 91\n | 18\n | 19\n | 320\n | 94\n |\n\n\n\n\n| **Spain's European Championship record** |\n| --- |\n| First match\n | ![](image) Spain 2–1 Hungary ![](image)(Madrid, Spain; 17 June 1964)\n |\n| Biggest win\n | ![](image) Spain 5–0 Slovakia ![](image)(Seville, Spain; 23 June 2021)\n |\n| Biggest defeat\n | ![](image) France 2–0 Spain ![](image)(Paris, France; 27 June 1984)![](image) West Germany 2–0 Spain ![](image)(Munich, West Germany; 17 June 1988)![](image) Italy 2–0 Spain ![](image) (Saint-Denis, France; 27 June 2016)\n |\n| Best result\n | **Champions** in 1964, 2008, 2012 |\n| Worst result\n | Group stage in 1980, 1988, 2004 |\n\n\n### UEFA Nations League[edit]\n\n\nSince the inaugural UEFA Nations League, La Roja have remained in League A and have reached the UEFA Nations League Finals on two occasions.
