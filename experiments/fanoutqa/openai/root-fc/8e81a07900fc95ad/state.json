It took place in Russia from 14 June to 15 July 2018, after the country was awarded the hosting rights in 2010. It was the eleventh time the championships had been held in Europe, and the first time they were held in Eastern Europe. At an estimated cost of over $14.2 billion, it was the most expensive World Cup ever held until it was surpassed by the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.[1][2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe tournament phase involved 32 teams, of which 31 came through qualifying competitions, while the host nation Russia qualified automatically. Of the 32, 20 had also appeared in the 2014 event, while Iceland and Panama each made their debut at the World Cup. 64 matches were played in 12 venues across 11 cities. Germany, the defending champions, were eliminated in the group stage for the first time since 1938. Host nation  Russia was eliminated in the quarter-finals. In the final, France played Croatia on 15 July at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow. France won the match 4\u20132, claiming their second World Cup and becoming the fourth consecutive title won by a European team, after Italy in 2006, Spain in 2010, and Germany in 2014.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNotable teams that failed to qualify included: four-time champions Italy (for the first time since 1958), who were knocked out in a qualification play-off by quarter-finalists Sweden and were the highest-ranked team to not qualify; and the Netherlands, who were three-time runners-up and had finished in third place in 2014, and had qualified for the last three World Cups. Four reigning continental champions: 2017 Africa Cup of Nations winners Cameroon; two-time Copa Am\u00e9rica champions and 2017 Confederations Cup runners-up Chile; 2016 OFC Nations Cup winners New Zealand; and 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup champions the United States (for the first time since 1986) also failed to qualify. The other notable qualifying streaks broken were for Ghana and Ivory Coast, both of which had qualified for the three previous tournaments.[61] The lowest-ranked team to qualify was the host nation, Russia.\n\n\nNote: Numbers in parentheses indicate positions in the FIFA World Rankings at the time of the tournament.[62]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOf the 32 nations qualified to play at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, 20 countries competed at the previous tournament in 2014. Both Iceland and Panama qualified for the first time, with the former becoming the smallest country in terms of population to reach the World Cup.[59] Other teams returning after absences of at least three tournaments included: Egypt, returning to the finals after their last appearance in 1990; Morocco, who last competed in 1998; Peru, who last appeared in 1982; and Senegal, competing for the second time after reaching the quarter-finals in 2002. It was the first time three Nordic countries (Denmark, Iceland and Sweden) and four Arab nations (Egypt, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia) qualified for the World Cup.[60]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Pot 1\n | Pot 2\n | Pot 3\n | Pot 4\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Russia (65) *(hosts)*![](image)\u00a0Germany (1)![](image)\u00a0Brazil (2)![](image)\u00a0Belgium (3)![](image)\u00a0Portugal (4)![](image)\u00a0Argentina (5)![](image)\u00a0Poland (6)![](image)\u00a0France (7)\n | ![](image)\u00a0Spain (8)![](image)\u00a0Peru (10)![](image)\u00a0\u00a0Switzerland (11)![](image)\u00a0England (12)![](image)\u00a0Colombia (13)![](image)\u00a0Mexico (16)![](image)\u00a0Uruguay (17)![](image)\u00a0Croatia (18)\n | ![](image)\u00a0Denmark (19)![](image)\u00a0Iceland (21)![](image)\u00a0Costa Rica (22)![](image)\u00a0Sweden (25)![](image)\u00a0Tunisia (28)![](image)\u00a0Egypt (30)![](image)\u00a0Senegal (32)![](image)\u00a0Iran (34)\n | ![](image)\u00a0Serbia (38)![](image)\u00a0Nigeria (41)![](image)\u00a0Australia (43)![](image)\u00a0Japan (44)![](image)\u00a0Morocco (48)![](image)\u00a0Panama (49)![](image)\u00a0South Korea (62)![](image)\u00a0Saudi Arabia (63)\n |\n\n\n### Squads[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 FIFA World Cup squads\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAllegations of corruption in the bidding processes and concerns over bribery on the part of the Russian team and corruption by FIFA members for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups led to threats from England's FA to boycott the tournament.[35] They claimed that four members of the executive committee had requested bribes to vote for England, and Sepp Blatter had said it had already been arranged before the vote that Russia would win.[36] FIFA appointed Michael J. Garcia, a US attorney, to investigate and produce a report on the corruption allegations. Although the report was never published, FIFA released a 42-page summary of its findings as determined by German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert. Eckert's summary cleared Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing, but was denounced by critics as a whitewash.[37] Because of the controversy, the FA refused to accept Eckert's absolving Russia from blame. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n | **UEFA** (14)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Belgium (3)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Croatia (20)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Denmark (joint 12)\n* ![](image)\u00a0England (joint 12)\n* ![](image)\u00a0France (7)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Germany (1)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Iceland (22)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Poland (8)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Portugal (4)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Russia (70) (hosts)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Serbia (34)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Spain (10)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Sweden (24)\n* ![](image)\u00a0\u00a0Switzerland (6)\n | ![](image)Qualified\n Did not qualify\n Disqualified\n Not a FIFA member\n\n\n |\n\n### Draw[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 FIFA World Cup seeding\n\n![](image)Italian World Cup winner Fabio Cannavaro in Moscow at the 2018 World Cup draw\nThe draw was held on 1 December 2017 at 18:00 MSK at the State Kremlin Palace in Moscow.[63][64] The 32 teams were drawn into eight groups of four, by selecting one team from each of the four ranked pots.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n281. **^** \"McDonald's looking ahead to 2018\". *FIFA.com*.

In preparation for this, the teams were organised into four pots with the seven highest-ranked teams joining host nation Brazil in the seeded pot.[19] As with the previous tournaments, FIFA aimed to create groups which maximised geographic separation and therefore the unseeded teams were arranged into pots based on geographic considerations.[20][21] The draw took place on 6 December 2013 at the Costa do Sau\u00edpe resort in Bahia, during which the teams were drawn by various past World Cup-winning players.[22][23] Under the draw procedure, one randomly drawn team \u2013 Italy \u2013 was firstly relocated from Pot 4 to Pot 2 to create four equal pots of eight teams.[24]\n\n\n\n### Officials[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 FIFA World Cup officials\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n2014 FIFA World Cup stadiums\n |\n| --- |\n| * Mineir\u00e3o (Belo Horizonte)\n* Est\u00e1dio Nacional Man\u00e9 Garrincha (Bras\u00edlia)\n* Arena Pantanal (Cuiab\u00e1)\n* Arena da Baixada (Curitiba)\n* Castel\u00e3o (Fortaleza)\n* Arena da Amaz\u00f4nia (Manaus)\n* Arena das Dunas (Natal)\n* Beira-Rio (Porto Alegre)\n* Arena Pernambuco (Recife)\n* Maracan\u00e3 (Rio de Janeiro)\n* Arena Fonte Nova (Salvador)\n* Arena Corinthians (S\u00e3o Paulo)\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nReferees at the 2014 FIFA World Cup\n |\n| --- |\n| AFC | * Ravshan Irmatov\n* Yuichi Nishimura\n* Nawaf Shukralla\n* Ben Williams\n |\n| CAF | * Noumandiez Dou\u00e9\n* Bakary Gassama\n* Djamel Haimoudi\n |\n| CONCACAF | * Joel Aguilar\n* Mark Geiger\n* Marco Antonio Rodr\u00edguez\n |\n| CONMEBOL | * Enrique Osses\n* N\u00e9stor Pitana\n* Wilmar Rold\u00e1n\n* Sandro Ricci\n* Carlos Vera\n |\n| OFC | * Peter O'Leary\n |\n| UEFA | * Felix Brych\n* C\u00fcneyt \u00c7ak\u0131r\n* Jonas Eriksson\n* Bj\u00f6rn Kuipers\n* Milorad Ma\u017ei\u0107\n* Pedro Proen\u00e7a\n* Nicola Rizzoli\n* Carlos Velasco Carballo\n* Howard Webb\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe **2014 FIFA World Cup** was the 20th FIFA World Cup, the quadrennial world championship for men's national football teams organised by FIFA. It took place in Brazil from 12 June to 13 July 2014, after the country was awarded the hosting rights in 2007. It was the second time that Brazil staged the competition, the first being in 1950, and the fifth time that it was held in South America.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the tournament, FIFA received significant criticism for the way head injuries are handled during matches. Two incidents in particular attracted the most attention. First, in a group stage match, after Uruguayan defender \u00c1lvaro Pereira received a blow to the head, he lay unconscious.[156] The Uruguayan doctor signaled for the player to be substituted, but he returned to the match. The incident drew criticism from the professional players' union FIFPro, and from Michel D'Hooghe, a member of the FIFA executive board and chairman of its medical committee.[157]\n\n\nSecond, in the Final, German midfielder Christoph Kramer received a blow to the head from a collision in the 14th minute, but returned to the match before collapsing in the 31st minute. During that time, Kramer was disoriented and confused, and asked the referee Nicola Rizzoli whether the match he was playing in was the World Cup Final.[158]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup\n* FIFA World Cup\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBase camps were used by the 32 national squads to stay and train before and during the World Cup tournament. On 31 January 2014, FIFA announced the base camps for each participating team,[32] having earlier circulated a brochure of 84 prospective locations.[35] Most teams opted to stay in the Southeast Region of Brazil, with only eight teams choosing other regions; five teams (Croatia, Germany, Ghana, Greece and Switzerland) opted to stay in the Northeast Region and three teams (Ecuador, South Korea and Spain) opted to stay in the South Region. None opted to stay in the North Region or the Central-West Region.[36] Campo Bahia, the base camp of the eventual champion Germany, attracted much interest.[37]\n\n\n\n\n\n| National squads' base camps\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** Passarinho, Nathalia; Matoso, Filipe (14 July 2014). \"Em balan\u00e7o da Copa, Dilma diz que Brasil derrotou progn\u00f3sticos 'terr\u00edveis'\". *G1* (in Portuguese).

Uruguay were eliminated in the round of 16, and France exited in the quarter-finals.

Prominent examples were the Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, which already held a Fan Fest in 2010, and S\u00e3o Paulo's Vale do Anhangaba\u00fa.[38][39] The first official event took place on Iracema Beach, in Fortaleza, on 8 June 2014.[40]\n\n\n\n## Innovations[edit]\n\n\n### Technologies[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe first drawn (and goalless) match did not occur until the 13th match of the tournament, between Iran and Nigeria: a drought longer than any World Cup since 1930.[67] The group stage produced a total of 136 goals (an average of 2.83 goals per match), nine fewer than were scored during the entire 2010 tournament.[68] This is the largest number of goals in the group stage since the 32-team system was implemented in 1998[69] and the largest average in a group stage since 1958.[70] World Cup holders Spain were eliminated after only two games, the quickest exit for the defending champions since Italy's from the 1950 tournament.[71] Spain also became the fourth nation to be eliminated in the first round while holding the World Cup crown, the first one being Italy in 1950 (and again in 2010), Brazil in 1966, and France in 2002.[72] For the first time, two teams from Africa advanced to the second round, a feat that would be repeated in the 2022 tournament.\n\n\n\n### Group A[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe marketing of the 2014 FIFA World Cup included sale of tickets, support from sponsors and promotion through events that utilise the symbols and songs of the tournament. Popular merchandise included items featuring the official mascot as well as an official video game that has been developed by EA Sports.[118] As a partner of the German Football Association, part of German major airline Lufthansa's fleet was branded \"Fanhansa\" for the time being. Branded planes flew the Germany national team, media representatives and football fans to Brazil.[119]\n\n\nThe Sony Xperia Z2 was dubbed the \"official smartphone of the 2014 FIFA World Cup\".[120]\n\n\n\n### Sponsorship[edit]\n\n\nThe sponsors of the 2014 World Cup are divided into three categories: FIFA Partners, FIFA World Cup Sponsors and National Supporters.[121]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n145. **^** Peck, Brooks (29 May 2013). \"Sepp Blatter, Brazil president Dilma booed at Confederations Cup opening ceremony\". *Sports.yahoo.com*.

The water-based spray, which disappears within minutes of application, can be used to mark a ten-yard line for the defending team during a free kick and also to draw where the ball is to be placed for a free kick.[45]\n\n\nThe Adidas Brazuca was the official match ball of the 2014 FIFA World Cup[46][47][48][49] and was supplied by Forward Sports of Sialkot, Pakistan.[46] Adidas created a new design of ball after criticisms of the Adidas Jabulani used in the previous World Cup. The number of panels was reduced to six, with the panels being thermally bonded. This created a ball with increased consistency and aerodynamics compared to its predecessor. Furthermore, Adidas underwent an extensive testing process lasting more than two years to produce a ball that would meet the approval of football professionals.\n\n\n\n### Cooling breaks[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n79. **^** Setterlund, Carl (28 June 2014). \"Colombia topples Uruguay to reach first World Cup quarterfinals\".

The least-used venues were in Cuiab\u00e1, Manaus, Natal, and Curitiba, which hosted four matches each; as the four smallest stadiums in use at the tournament, they did not host any knockout round matches.[34]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDue to the relatively high ambient temperatures in Brazil, particularly at the northern venues, cooling breaks for the players were introduced.[50] Breaks could take place at the referee's discretion after the 30th minute of each half if the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature exceeded 32\u00a0\u00b0C (90\u00a0\u00b0F); the breaks would last 3 minutes, with this time made up by an extended period of stoppage time at the end of the half.\n\n\nThe first cooling break in a World Cup play took place during the 32nd minute of the match between the Netherlands and Mexico in the round of 16.[51][52][53][54] At the start of the match, FIFA listed the temperature at 32\u00a0\u00b0C (90\u00a0\u00b0F) with 68% humidity.[55]\n\n\n\n### Anti-doping[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n46. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Howells, Richard (11 June 2014). \"World Cup 2014: Adidas \"Brazuca\" Ball Scores With Fans\". *Forbes*.

It took place in South Africa from 11 June to 11 July 2010. The bidding process for hosting the tournament finals was open only to African nations.

South Africa, which had narrowly failed to win the right to host the 2006 event, was thus awarded the right to host the tournament.[12] Campaigning for South Africa to be granted host status, Nelson Mandela had previously spoken of the importance of football in his life, stating that while incarcerated in Robben Island prison playing football \"made us feel alive and triumphant despite the situation we found ourselves in\".[13] With South Africa winning their bid, an emotional Mandela raised the FIFA World Cup Trophy.[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n62. **^** \"Theron, Beckham and Gebrselassie to star at the Final Draw on 4 December\". *FIFA.com*.

Five African nations placed bids to host the 2010 World Cup: Egypt, Morocco, South Africa and a joint bid from Libya and Tunisia.\n\n\nFollowing the decision of the FIFA Executive Committee not to allow co-hosted tournaments, Tunisia withdrew from the bidding process.

Teams were permitted to make late replacements in the event of serious injury, at any time up to 24 hours before their first game.[66]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSome controversies arose during the qualifications. In the second leg of the play-off between France and the Republic of Ireland, French captain Thierry Henry, unseen by the referee, handled the ball in the lead up to a late goal, which enabled France to qualify ahead of Ireland, sparking widespread comment and debate. FIFA rejected a request from the Football Association of Ireland to replay the match,[23] and Ireland later withdrew a request to be included as an unprecedented 33rd World Cup entrant.[24][25] As a result, FIFA announced a review into the use of technology or extra officials at the highest level, but decided against the widely expected fast-tracking of goal-line referee's assistants for the South African tournament.[26]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe FIFA Organising Committee approved the procedure for the final draw on 2 December 2009. The seeding was based on the October 2009 FIFA World Ranking and seven squads joined hosts South Africa as seeded teams for the final draw.

The English said thank you and accepted that you can win some and you lose some and the Mexicans bowed their head and accepted it.\"[85] Blatter also promised to re-open the discussion regarding devices which monitor possible goals and make that information immediately available to match officials, saying: \"We will naturally take on board the discussion on technology and have the first opportunity in July at the business meeting.\"[85] Blatter's call came less than four months after FIFA general secretary J\u00e9r\u00f4me Valcke said the door was closed on goal-line technology and video replays after a vote by the IFAB.[85]\n\n\n\n26 June 2010\n16:00\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n2010 FIFA World Cup| * isiZulu: *iNdebe Yomhlaba Ye-FIFA ka-2010*\n* Afrikaans: *FIFA Sokker-W\u00eareldbekertoernooi in 2010*\n* isiXhosa: *2010 FIFuRoni da Futboll*\n* Northern Sotho: *Mogopo wa Lefase wa FIFA wa 2010*\n* Sesotho: *Mohope wa lefatse wa FIFA 2010*\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)*Ke Nako* (Tswana and Sotho)*It's time.

It involved four bidding nations after Brazil had withdrawn three days earlier: Germany, South Africa, England and Morocco.[2] Three rounds of voting were required, each round eliminating the nation with the fewest votes. The first two rounds were held on 6 July 2000, and the final round was held on 7 July 2000, which Germany won over South Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Voting results[3] |\n| --- |\n| Country\n | Round 1\n | Round 2\n | Round 3\n |\n| Germany | **10** | **11** | **12** |\n| South Africa | 6 | **11** | 11\n |\n| England | 5 | 2 | \u2013\n |\n| Morocco | 3 | \u2013 | \u2013\n |\n\n\n### Bribery and corruption allegations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nItaly won the tournament, claiming their fourth World Cup title, defeating France 5\u20133 in a penalty shoot-out in the final after extra time had finished in a 1\u20131 draw. Germany defeated Portugal 3\u20131 to finish in third place. Angola, Ukraine, Ghana, the Ivory Coast, Trinidad and Tobago and Togo made their first appearances in the finals. It was also the only appearance of Serbia and Montenegro under that name; they had previously appeared in 1998 as Yugoslavia. In late May 2006, immediately prior to the tournament, Montenegro voted in a referendum to become an independent nation and dissolve the loose confederacy then existing between it and Serbia; Serbia recognised the results of the referendum in early June. Due to time constraints, FIFA had Serbia and Montenegro play in the World Cup tournament as one team, marking the first instance of multiple sovereign nations competing as one team in a major football tournament since UEFA Euro 1992.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"World Cup and Television\" (PDF).

No other player scored more than three goals. No player from the winning Italian squad scored more than two goals, though ten players had scored for the team, tying France's record in 1982 for the most goalscorers from any one team.\n\n\nFor the first time ever in the FIFA World Cup, the first and last goals of the tournament were scored by defenders. German left-back Philipp Lahm scored the opener against Costa Rica after only 5\u00a0minutes of the opening match. In the final, Italian centre-back Marco Materazzi out-jumped Patrick Vieira and headed in the last goal of the 2006 World Cup.

The team was chosen from a shortlist of over 50\u00a0players, and was selected based on performances from the second round onwards.[47][48]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccusations of bribery and corruption had marred the success of Germany's bid from the very beginning. On the very day of the vote, a hoax bribery affair was made public, leading to calls for a re-vote.[4] On the night before the vote, German satirical magazine *Titanic* sent letters to FIFA representatives, offering joke gifts like cuckoo clocks and Black Forest ham in exchange for their vote for Germany. Oceania delegate Charlie Dempsey, who had initially backed England, had then been instructed to support South Africa following England's elimination. He abstained, citing \"intolerable pressure\" on the eve of the vote.[5] Had Dempsey voted as originally instructed, the vote would have resulted with a 12\u201312 tie, and FIFA president Sepp Blatter, who favoured the South African bid,[6] would have had to cast the deciding vote.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Fans in celebratory motorcade\n![](image)Celebrating fans in Olympiapark in Munich during the opening match between Germany and Costa Rica\nFIFA president Sepp Blatter stated the organization of the tournament was the best in history and that Germany had a welcoming public.[102] Through the many fanfests and large-screen broadcasts the feeling of a four-week national festival developed, in which much of the population took part.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 22 March 2016, it was announced that the FIFA Ethics Committee was opening proceedings into the bid.[15][16][17]\n\n\n\n## Qualification[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification\n\n198 teams attempted to qualify for the 2006 World Cup.[18] Germany, the host nation, was granted automatic qualification, with the remaining 31 finals places divided among the continental confederations. Thirteen places were contested by UEFA teams (Europe), five by CAF teams (Africa), four by CONMEBOL teams (South America), four by AFC teams (Asia), and three by CONCACAF teams (North and Central America and Caribbean). The remaining two places were decided by playoffs between AFC and CONCACAF and between CONMEBOL and OFC (Oceania).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFIFA predetermined that, hosts, Germany would be placed in Group A, thus being assured of the venues of their group matches in advance of the draw. They also announced, in advance, that Brazil (the defending champion) would be allocated to Group F.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDespite early success by Australia, Ecuador and Ghana, the tournament marked a return to dominance of traditional football powers. Four years after the 2002 tournament, in which teams from North America (the United States), Africa (Senegal) and Asia (South Korea) made it deep into the knockout stages and Turkey finished third, all eight seeded teams progressed to the knockout stages and none of the quarter-finalists were from outside Europe or South America. Six former champions took part in the quarter-finals, with Ukraine and Euro 2004 runners-up Portugal as the only relative outsiders.[41] Argentina and Brazil were eliminated in the quarter-finals, leaving an all-European final four for only the fourth time (after the 1934, 1966 and 1982 tournaments).\n\n\n\n### Scoring[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFile:FIFA World Cup 2006 Opening Ceremony.jpg2006 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony in Munich\nThe finals tournament of the 2006 World Cup began on 9 June. The 32\u00a0teams were divided into eight groups of four teams each, within which the teams competed in a round-robin tournament to determine which two of those four teams would advance to the sixteen-team knock-out stage, which started on 24 June. In total, 64\u00a0games were played.\n\n\n\n### Hosting[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* 2006 FIFA World Cup:\n\t+ A time to make friends\n\t+ Broadcasting rights\n\t+ Controversies\n\t+ Disciplinary record\n\t+ Officials\n\t+ Organizing Committee\n\t+ Qualification\n\t+ Seeding\n\t+ Sponsorship\n\t+ Squads\n\t+ FIFA World Cup records\n* Leeuwenhosen controversy\n* *Strangers*, a 2007 film which takes place during the 2006 World Cup\n* *Deutschland.

No two teams from the same group qualified for the quarters, all eight teams were from different groups.\n\n\nEngland struggled against Ecuador but won 1\u20130 thanks to a David Beckham free kick. Brazil won 3\u20130 against Ghana, in a game which included Ronaldo's record 15th World Cup goal. *Der Spiegel* reported that the match may have been influenced by an Asian betting syndicate.[44] Portugal defeated the Netherlands 1\u20130. The only goal came courtesy of a Maniche strike in an acrimonious match, which marked a new World Cup record with 16\u00a0yellow cards (Portugal: 9, the Netherlands: 7) and 4\u00a0players being sent off for a second bookable offence. France came from behind to defeat Spain 3\u20131 thanks to goals from Franck Rib\u00e9ry, Patrick Vieira, and Zinedine Zidane.\n\n\n\n24 June 2006\n17:00\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** \"Voting procedure for 2006 FIFA World Cup decision\".

Czech Republic and Ukraine were making their first appearance as independent nations, but had previously been represented as part of Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union respectively; Serbia and Montenegro had competed as Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1998, as well as making up part of Yugoslav teams from 1930 to 1990. As of 2022, this was the last time Togo, Angola, Czech Republic, Ukraine and Trinidad and Tobago qualified for a FIFA World Cup finals, and the last time Uruguay failed to qualify.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the original version of the rules for the finals tournament, the ranking criteria were in a different order, with head-to-head results taking precedence over total goal difference. The rules were changed to the above in advance of the tournament, but older versions were still available on the FIFA and UEFA websites, causing some confusion among those trying to identify the correct criteria.[39]\nIn any event, the finals tournament saw only two pairs of teams level on points: Argentina and the Netherlands at 7 points in Group C; Tunisia and Saudi Arabia at 1 point in Group H. Both of these ties were resolved on total goal difference. Also, in both cases the teams had tied their match, so the order of ranking criteria made no difference.\n\n\n\n## Finals tournament[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPictures of football supporters celebrating in front of video walls became a typical illustration of atmosphere in the country, while \"Fanmeile\" was later picked up as the German Word of the Year.[60] In 2007, FIFA and the 12 host cities received the German Marketing Prize for Sports for the innovative nature and marketing concept of Fan Fests.[61] FIFA and the Host Cities succeeded in creating and comfortable environment for foreign fans as 95% of them surveyed at Fan Fests agreed that it was an unequivocal declaration of international nature of World Cup and not a mere event for Germans.[58] A thought-out implementation of public viewing at such a large-scale football event as the 2006 World Cup became set a precedent. Immediately after the World Cup, FIFA announced that it registered the trademark for Fan Fests, taking over the organisation and marketing and making Fan Fests an integral part of future World Cups.[62]\n\n\n\n### Locations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Teams listed by FIFA ranking as of May 2006[19] |\n| --- |\n|  | Country | Confederation | Rank\n |\n| 1 | ![](image)\u00a0Brazil | CONMEBOL | 1\n |\n| 2 | ![](image)\u00a0Czech Republic | UEFA | 2\n |\n| 3 | ![](image)\u00a0Netherlands | UEFA | 3\n |\n| 4 | ![](image)\u00a0Mexico | CONCACAF | 4\n |\n| 5 | ![](image)\u00a0United States | CONCACAF | 5\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Spain | UEFA | 5\n |\n| 7 | ![](image)\u00a0Portugal | UEFA | 7\n |\n| 8 | ![](image)\u00a0France | UEFA | 8\n |\n| 9 | ![](image)\u00a0Argentina | CONMEBOL | 9\n |\n| 10 | ![](image)\u00a0England | UEFA | 10\n |\n| 11 | ![](image)\u00a0Italy | UEFA | 13\n |\n| 12 | ![](image)\u00a0Sweden | UEFA | 16\n |\n| 13 | ![](image)\u00a0Japan | AFC | 18\n |\n| 14 | ![](image)\u00a0Germany | UEFA | 19\n |\n| 15 | ![](image)\u00a0Tunisia | CAF | 21\n |\n| 16 | ![](image)\u00a0Iran | AFC | 23\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Croatia | UEFA | 23\n |\n| 18 | ![](image)\u00a0Costa Rica | CONCACAF | 25\n |\n| 19 | ![](image)\u00a0South Korea | AFC | 29\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Poland | UEFA | 29\n |\n| 21 | ![](image)\u00a0Ivory Coast | CAF | 32\n |\n| 22 | ![](image)\u00a0Paraguay | CONMEBOL | 33\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn Gelsenkirchen, England faced Portugal in a repeat of their Euro 2004 quarter-final.

The team's trainer, J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann, in February 2007 was furthermore awarded the Bundesverdienstkreuz, not least for his reformed methods of modern training and playing methods, in which he persevered despite harsh criticism. Nevertheless, Klinsmann announced after the tournament that he would not extend his contract as trainer of the national team, since he felt completely burned-out and wished to spend more time with his family in California.

Players received a record-breaking 345\u00a0yellow cards and 28\u00a0red cards, with Russian referee Valentin Ivanov handing out 16\u00a0yellow and 4\u00a0red cards in the round of 16 match between Portugal and the Netherlands in a match known as the Battle of Nuremberg. Portugal had two players suspended for each of the quarter-final and semi-final matches respectively. FIFA President Sepp Blatter hinted that he may allow some rule changes for future tournaments so that earlier accumulated bookings will not force players to miss the final, should their teams make it that far. The tournament also saw English referee Graham Poll mistakenly hand out three yellow cards to Croatia's Josip \u0160imuni\u0107 in their match against Australia.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Pos | Team* v\n* t\n* e\n | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts | Qualification\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image)\u00a0Brazil | 3\n | 3\n | 0\n | 0\n | 7\n | 1\n | +6\n | 9\n | Advance to knockout stage |\n| 2\n | ![](image)\u00a0Australia | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | 5\n | 5\n | 0\n | 4\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image)\u00a0Croatia | 3\n | 0\n | 2\n | 1\n | 2\n | 3\n | \u22121\n | 2\n |  |\n| 4\n | ![](image)\u00a0Japan | 3\n | 0\n | 1\n | 2\n | 2\n | 7\n | \u22125\n | 1\n |\n\nSource: FIFA  \nRules for classification: Tie-breaking criteria\n\n12 June 2006\n15:00\n\n\n| Australia\u00a0![](image) | 3\u20131 | ![](image)\u00a0Japan |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Cahill ![](image) 84', 89'\n* Aloisi ![](image) 90+2'\n | Report | * Nakamura ![](image) 26'\n |\n\nFritz-Walter-Stadion, Kaiserslautern\nAttendance: 46,000\nReferee: Essam Abd El Fatah (Egypt)\n\n13 June 2006\n21:00\n\n\n| Brazil\u00a0![](image) | 1\u20130 | ![](image)\u00a0Croatia |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Kak\u00e1 ![](image) 44'\n | Report |  |\n\nOlympiastadion, Berlin\nAttendance: 72,000\nReferee: Benito Archundia (Mexico)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![Munich](image)\nMunich\n![Stuttgart](image)\nStuttgart\n![Gelsenkirchen](image)\nGelsenkirchen\n![Hamburg](image)\nHamburg\n![Frankfurt](image)\nFrankfurt\n![Cologne](image)\nCologne\n![Hanover](image)\nHanover\n![Leipzig](image)\nLeipzig\n![Kaiserslautern](image)\nKaiserslautern\n![Nuremberg](image)\nNuremberg\n2006 FIFA World Cup (Germany)\n | Hamburg |\n| Arena AufSchalke\u2020**(FIFA World Cup Stadium, Gelsenkirchen)** | AOL Arena**(FIFA World Cup Stadium, Hamburg)** |\n| 51\u00b033\u203216.21\u2033N 7\u00b04\u20323.32\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff51.5545028\u00b0N 7.0675889\u00b0E\ufeff / 51.5545028; 7.0675889\ufeff (Arena AufSchalke) | 53\u00b035\u203213.77\u2033N 9\u00b053\u203255.02\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff53.5871583\u00b0N 9.8986167\u00b0E\ufeff / 53.5871583; 9.8986167\ufeff (AOL Arena) |\n| Capacity: **52,000**[25] | Capacity: **50,000**[26] |\n|  | ![](image) |\n| Frankfurt, Hesse | Kaiserslautern, Rhineland-Palatinate |\n| Commerzbank-Arena\u2020**(FIFA World Cup Stadium, Frankfurt)** | Fritz-Walter-Stadion |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn 16 October 2015, German news magazine *Der Spiegel* alleged that a slush fund with money from then-Adidas CEO Robert Louis-Dreyfus was used to influence the vote of four Asian members of the FIFA executive committee.[10] The sum of \u20ac6.7\u00a0million was later demanded back by Dreyfus.

The experience of past World Cups and public viewing was conceptualized in 4-week-long events for football supporters to meet, board, interact, partake in cultural activities and watch all 64 matches on giant video walls. Since 2004, the details on costs, logistics, safety issues, marketing and broadcasting rights were jointly hammered out by FIFA and the host cities.[52] These public viewing events, known as \"Fan Fests\" (German: *Fanmeile*), served an idea to provide football supporters without tickets a legitimate opportunity to partake in the World Cup. Unlike the past tournaments where ticket-less fans were treated as security risks, the World Cup in Germany welcomed all supporters, thus generating positive atmosphere even before the tournament began. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n23. **^** \"Dortmund\". *FIFA (F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association)*.

Both teams had chances to score the winning goal in normal time: Luca Toni hit the crossbar in the 35th minute for Italy (he later had a header disallowed for offside), while France were not awarded a possible second penalty in the 53rd minute when Florent Malouda went down in the box after a tackle from Gianluca Zambrotta.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSquads for the 2006 World Cup consisted of 23\u00a0players, as in the previous tournament in 2002. Each participating national association had to confirm its 23-player squad by 15 May 2006.[35]\n\n\n\n## Groups[edit]\n\n\n### Seeds[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: 2006 FIFA World Cup seeding\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAustralia qualified for the first time since 1974. Among the teams who failed to qualify were 2002 third-placed team Turkey, quarter-finalists Senegal, Euro 2004 winners Greece and 2006 Africa Cup of Nations winners Egypt. Additionally, Belgium failed to qualify for the first time since 1978 and Cameroon failed to qualify for the first time since 1986. The other notable qualifying streaks broken were for Nigeria, who had made the previous three tournaments, and Denmark and South Africa, who had both qualified for the previous two. France had their first successful qualifying campaign since 1986, as they did not qualify for the 1990 and 1994 World Cups, in 1998 they were automatically qualified as hosts and in 2002 as defending champions.\n\n\nFor the first time since the 1982 World Cup, all six confederations were represented at the finals tournament.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n18 June 2006\n15:00\n\n\n| Japan\u00a0![](image) | 0\u20130 | ![](image)\u00a0Croatia |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report |  |\n\nFrankenstadion, Nuremberg\nAttendance: 41,000\nReferee: Frank De Bleeckere (Belgium)\n\n18 June 2006\n18:00\n\n\n| Brazil\u00a0![](image) | 2\u20130 | ![](image)\u00a0Australia |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Adriano ![](image) 49'\n* Fred ![](image) 90'\n | Report |  |\n\nFIFA World Cup Stadium, Munich\nAttendance: 66,000\nReferee: Markus Merk (Germany)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n22 June 2006\n21:00\n\n\n| Japan\u00a0![](image) | 1\u20134 | ![](image)\u00a0Brazil |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Tamada ![](image) 34'\n | Report | * Ronaldo ![](image) 45+1', 81'\n* Juninho ![](image) 53'\n* Gilberto ![](image) 59'\n |\n\nWestfalenstadion, Dortmund\nAttendance: 65,000\nReferee: \u00c9ric Poulat (France)\n\n22 June 2006\n21:00\n\n\n| Croatia\u00a0![](image) | 2\u20132 | ![](image)\u00a0Australia |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Srna ![](image) 2'\n* N.

Brazil became the only team since Argentina in 1986 to win the trophy without needing to win a penalty shoot-out at some stage during the knockout phase and the total number of penalty shoot-outs (2) was the lowest since the four-round knockout format was introduced in 1986. Brazil also became the first team to win every match at a World Cup since 1970 and set a new record for highest aggregate goal difference (+14) for a World Cup winner. Brazil's captain Cafu, who became the first player to appear in three successive World Cup finals, accepted the trophy on behalf of the team.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n40. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"The FIFA World Cup Final Draw history\" (PDF).

The only other countries to have been awarded a World Cup without previously having competed in a final tournament are Italy in 1934 and Qatar in 2022 (Uruguay hosted the first World Cup in 1930 so there was no prior tournament; they were defending Olympic champions from 1928).\n\n\nThe unusual choice of host proved an issue for football fans in Europe, used to watching international matches on or close to their time zone.[7] With games taking place in the European morning, some schools and businesses chose to open late on match days or set up communal watching events before the start of work.[8][9]\n\n\n\n## Qualification[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the third place play-off match against South Korea, Turkey won 3\u20132, taking third place in only their second ever FIFA World Cup, and scored the fastest goal in the FIFA World Cup history (10.8 seconds after kick-off).[2]\n\n\nThe 2002 World Cup was also the last one to use the golden goal rule and the last one to use the same ball for all matches. Starting in 2006 and continuing to the present, a ball with the same technical specifications but different colors has been used in the final.\n\n\n\n\n## Host selection[edit]\n\n\nMain article: FIFA World Cup hosts\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe tournament had several upsets and surprise results, which included the defending champions France being eliminated in the group stage after earning a single point without scoring a goal and second favourites Argentina also being eliminated in the group stage. South Korea managed to reach the semi-finals, beating Poland, Portugal, Italy and Spain en route. They became the first team from outside of the UEFA, CONMEBOL, and CONCACAF regions and one of the first Asian teams (along with Turkey in this World Cup) to reach the semi-finals of a World Cup.

The historic tradition to seed the hosts (Japan and South Korea) and holders (France) was upheld; while the remaining five seeds were granted to the other five of the top six teams, ranked by their results in the last three FIFA World Cups (ratio 3:2:1) and their FIFA World Ranking position in the last month of the past three years (equal ratio).[37]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe World Cup was originally going to be hosted either in Japan or in South Korea, but in the end both rivals had decided to share the hosting duties thus making this World Cup the first to have multiple host nations. However, there were concerns regarding the selection of hosts due to logistical issues caused by fans traveling across two separate sovereign nations as well as whether some of the 20 stadiums to be constructed for the World Cup would be ready in time for it or not. While political and infrastructural problems were eventually overcome, there still remained the issue of East Asia's wet season which could disrupt the play. The timing of the tournament thus had been altered to mitigate as much as possible against such issues, with the tournament kicking off on May 31 and due to run until June 30, the earliest date for a World Cup final since 1986.[83]\n\n\nThe time difference caused issues for fans worldwide especially in Europe, where people had to go to work when matches were played.[84]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe hosts became the first team in the Asian Football Confederation to reach the semi-finals of the World Cup, eclipsing the record of their North Korean counterparts who reached the quarter-finals in 1966. They also became the first World Cup semi-final team not from UEFA or CONMEBOL since the United States did it in the first World Cup in 1930. Turkey defeated Senegal 1\u20130 in Osaka, with a golden goal scored by \u0130lhan Mans\u0131z in the 94th minute.\n\n\n\n21 June 2002\n15:30\n\n\n| England\u00a0![](image) | 1\u20132 | ![](image)\u00a0Brazil |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Owen ![](image) 23' | Report | Rivaldo ![](image) 45+2'Ronaldinho ![](image) 50' |\n\nStadium Ecopa, Shizuoka\nAttendance: 47,436\nReferee: Felipe Ramos (Mexico)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n21 June 2002\n20:30\n\n\n| Germany\u00a0![](image) | 1\u20130 | ![](image)\u00a0United States |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Ballack ![](image) 39' | Report |  |\n\nMunsu Football Stadium, Ulsan\nAttendance: 37,337\nReferee: Hugh Dallas (Scotland)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n22 June 2002\n15:30\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Some say Bonn, which did not host a match for the 1974 FIFA World Cup, was only the de facto seat of government of host West Germany but *not* its official *de jure* capital, which was Berlin.

This format was identical with the tournament structure being used in 1998.

Sweden and Senegal faced off in \u014cita and finished 1\u20131 in regular time and it took a golden goal from Henri Camara in extra time to settle the game for Senegal 2\u20131, which lead to Senegal becoming only the second African team to reach the last eight (after Cameroon in 1990). Spain and the Republic of Ireland played in Suwon, where Spain led most of the match 1\u20130 until a late penalty kick scored by Robbie Keane made the match go to extra time, where Spain emerged victorious in a penalty shoot-out. The United States beat CONCACAF rivals Mexico 2\u20130 in Jeonju with Brian McBride and Landon Donovan scoring the goals. Brazil defeated Belgium 2\u20130 in Kobe, with an amazing volley by Rivaldo and a splendid counter-attack goal by Ronaldo. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1. Pot 1 was used to draw, in alphabetic group order, the remaining five top-seeded teams for the first position of groups B, C, E, F and G; while respecting the restriction that one of the two South American seeds (Brazil and Argentina) had to play in a group played in South Korea (B/C) and the other had to play in a group played in Japan (E/F/G).\n2. Pot 2 was used to draw one European team to each of the eight groups (drawing unrestricted in the alphabetic order from A to H).\n3. As per the FIFA rule of only allowing a maximum of two European teams in each group, the remaining three European teams from Pot 2, was subject to a second draw, to be put in either of the four groups containing a top-seeded South American team or Asian team. This was done by first drawing the European team from Pot 2, and then drawing which seeded opponent the European team should be paired with, from a special bowl with four blue balls containing the names of Brazil, Argentina, Japan and South Korea.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Mexico\u00a0![](image) | 0\u20132 | ![](image)\u00a0United States |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report | McBride ![](image) 8'Donovan ![](image) 65' |\n\nJeonju World Cup Stadium, Jeonju\nAttendance: 36,380\nReferee: V\u00edtor Melo Pereira (Portugal)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n17 June 2002\n20:30\n\n\n| Brazil\u00a0![](image) | 2\u20130 | ![](image)\u00a0Belgium |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Rivaldo ![](image) 67'Ronaldo ![](image) 87' | Report |  |\n\nKobe Wing Stadium, Kobe\nAttendance: 40,440\nReferee: Peter Prendergast (Jamaica)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n18 June 2002\n15:30\n\n\n| Japan\u00a0![](image) | 0\u20131 | ![](image)\u00a0Turkey |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report | \u00dcmit Davala ![](image) 12' |\n\nMiyagi Stadium, Rifu\nAttendance: 45,666\nReferee: Pierluigi Collina (Italy)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n18 June 2002\n20:30\n\n\n| South Korea\u00a0![](image) | 2\u20131 (a.e.t./g.g.) | ![](image)\u00a0Italy |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Seol Ki-Hyeon ![](image) 88'Ahn Jung-Hwan ![gold-colored soccer ball](image)\u00a0117'  | Report | Vieri ![](image) 18' |\n\nDaejeon World Cup Stadium, Daejeon\nAttendance: 38,588\nReferee: Byron Moreno (Ecuador)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| South Africa\u00a0![](image) | 2\u20133 | ![](image)\u00a0Spain |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| McCarthy ![](image) 31'Radebe ![](image) 53' | Report | Ra\u00fal ![](image) 4', 56'Mendieta ![](image) 45+1' |\n\nDaejeon World Cup Stadium, Daejeon\nAttendance: 31,024\nReferee: Saad Mane (Kuwait)\n\n12 June 2002\n20:30 KST (UTC+9)\n\n\n| Slovenia\u00a0![](image) | 1\u20133 | ![](image)\u00a0Paraguay |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| A\u010dimovi\u010d ![](image) 45+1' | Report | Cuevas ![](image) 65', 84'Campos ![](image) 73' |\n\nJeju World Cup Stadium, Seogwipo\nAttendance: 30,176\nReferee: Felipe Ramos (Mexico)\n\n### Group C[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2002 FIFA World Cup Group C\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nUEFA* Kim Milton Nielsen (Denmark)\n* Graham Poll (England)\n* Gilles Veissi\u00e8re (France)\n* Markus Merk (Germany)\n* Kyros Vassaras (Greece)\n* Pierluigi Collina (Italy)\n* Jan Wegereef (Netherlands)\n* Terje Hauge (Norway)\n* V\u00edtor Melo Pereira (Portugal)\n* Hugh Dallas (Scotland)\n* \u013dubo\u0161 Miche\u013e (Slovakia)\n* Antonio L\u00f3pez Nieto (Spain)\n* Anders Frisk (Sweden)\n* Urs Meier (Switzerland)\n\n\n | Assistant referees\nAFC* Komaleeswaran Sankar (India)\n* Awni Hassaouneh (Jordan)\n* Haidar Koleit (Lebanon)\n* Mat Lazim Awang Hamat (Malaysia)\n* Mohamed Saeed (Maldives)\n* Ali Al-Traifi (Saudi Arabia)\n* Visva Krishnan (Singapore)\n\nCAF* Wagih Farag (Egypt)\n* Dramane Dante (Mali)\n* Taoufik Adjengui (Tunisia)\n* Ali Tomusange (Uganda)\n* Brighton Mudzamiri (Zimbabwe)\n\nCONCACAF* Curtis Charles (Antigua and Barbuda)\n* H\u00e9ctor Vergara (Canada)\n* Vladimir Fern\u00e1ndez (El Salvador)\n* Michael Ragoonath (Trinidad and Tobago)\n\nCONMEBOL* Jorge Rattalino (Argentina)\n* Jorge Oliveira (Brazil)\n* Bomer Fierro (Ecuador)\n* Miguel Giacomuzzi (Paraguay)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n79. **^** \"2018 FIFA World Cup Russia Official Song 'Live It Up' to be performed by all-star line-up\".

He served as a member of the National Assembly from 2012 to 2017, representing the seventh constituency of Seine-Maritime. After being elected to the presidency on 7 May 2017, Macron appointed him Prime Minister of France. Philippe subsequently appointed his government on 17 May. He was succeeded by Jean Castex before his reelection to the mayorship in Le Havre.\n\n\nAs Prime minister, Philippe oversaw the passage of a package of labour law and taxation system reforms as part of Macron's self-proclaimed 'pro-business' agenda. During his time in office, he also led the controversial police response to the Yellow Vests crisis starting in late 2018, and later became a prominent figure in leading the French government's early response to the COVID-19 pandemic, implementing a 55-day national lockdown starting on 17 March 2020. \n\n\nIn 2021, a year after the end of his premiership, Philippe founded the centre-right Horizons party which then became part of the governing Ensemble coalition in the context of the 2022 legislative election.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\n\u00c9douard Philippe, the son of French teachers, was born in Rouen in 1970 and grew up in a left-wing household. He has one sibling, a sister.[3] He comes from a family of dockworkers, a profession in which members of his family are still employed.[4] He grew up in a suburban neighbourhood in Rouen. He was at first a pupil at the Michelet School in Rouen before moving to Grand-Quevilly where he attended Jean-Texier College and later attending Lyc\u00e9e les Bruy\u00e8res in Sotteville-l\u00e8s-Rouen.[5]\n\n\nHe obtained his baccalaur\u00e9at at the \u00c9cole de Gaulle-Adenauer in Bonn, and after a year in hypokh\u00e2gne, he studied at Sciences Po for three years and graduated in 1992, and later studied at the \u00c9cole nationale d'administration (\u00c9NA) from 1995 to 1997 (the \"Marc Bloch cohort\").[6][7]\n\n\nPhilippe served as an artillery officer during his national service in 1994. He continued to serve in the operational reserve for several years afterwards.[8]\n\n\nIn his years at Sciences Po, he supported Michel Rocard and was influenced by him, identifying with the Rocardian and social democratic wings of the Socialist Party. His brief flirtation with the Socialists ended after Rocard was toppled from the leadership of the Socialist Party. After leaving the \u00c9NA in 1997, he went on to work at the Council of State,[6][7] specialising in public procurement law.[9]\n\n\n\n## Political career[edit]\n\n\nIn 2001, Philippe joined Antoine Rufenacht as Deputy Mayor of Le Havre charged with legal affairs;[10] Rufenacht served as mayor of Le Havre from 1995 to 2010 and campaign director for Jacques Chirac in the 2002 presidential election.[7] Recognising the ideological proximity between Michel Rocard and Alain Jupp\u00e9, Philippe supported the latter at the time of the creation of the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) in 2002, marking the end of his left-wing activism;[7] the same year, he failed to win his constituency in the legislative elections.[9] He served under Jupp\u00e9 as director general of services of the UMP until 2004, when the mayor of Bordeaux was convicted as a result of the fictitious jobs case implicating the Rally for the Republic (RPR). He then took a job in the private sector, working with the American law firm Debevoise & Plimpton,[6][7] and was elected to the regional council of Upper Normandy the same year.[10]\n\n\nIn the wake of Nicolas Sarkozy's victory in the 2007 presidential election, Philippe briefly returned to political life working for Alain Jupp\u00e9, when Jupp\u00e9 served briefly as Minister of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy, before being appointed Director of Public Affairs at Areva, where he worked from 2007 to 2010.[7] He was also substitute to Jean-Yves Besselat, who served as the member of the National Assembly for Seine-Maritime's 7th constituency from 2007 to 2012.[6] In 2008, he was elected to the general council of Seine-Maritime in the canton of Le Havre-5,[11] and in 2010 was elected mayor of Le Havre after the resignation of Rufenacht,[7] his mentor,[6] and also became President of the Agglomeration community of Le Havre the same year.[10] After Besselat's death in 2012 following a long illness, Philippe took his seat,[12] successfully holding it in the subsequent legislative elections.[7] He was reelected as Mayor of Le Havre in the 2014 municipal elections in the first round, with an absolute majority of 52.04% of expressed votes.[11] Following his resignation on 20 May 2017 as Le Havre Mayor, he retained a seat in the municipal council.\n\n\n\n### 2017 presidential election[edit]\n\n\nHe worked for the campaign of Alain Jupp\u00e9 in the primary of the right and centre in 2016, serving as a spokesperson alongside Benoist Apparu.[13] Though Philippe and Apparu, as well as Christophe B\u00e9chu, later joined the campaign of Fran\u00e7ois Fillon for the 2017 presidential election after his victory in the primary, the three parliamentarians \u2013 close to Jupp\u00e9 \u2013 quit on 2 March 2017 after the candidate was summoned to appear before judges amidst the Fillon affair.[7][14] He said he would not seek to retain his seat in the legislative elections in June to avoid breaching the law limiting the accumulation of mandates. Following the victory of Emmanuel Macron in the presidential election, there was speculation that Philippe was a potential choice for Prime Minister, representing three essential aspects: political renewal (at the age of only 46), affiliation with the centre-right, and familiarity with the political terrain.[7]\n\n\n\n### Prime Minister[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. *(October 2018)*\n |\n\n\n![](image)Aggregated opinion polls (\"political barometers\") monitoring Philippe's approval\nOn 15 May 2017, Philippe was appointed as Prime Minister by Emmanuel Macron after speculation he was a contender for the office alongside former Ecology Minister Jean-Louis Borloo, MoDem Leader Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou and IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde.[15][16]\n\n\n\n![](image)Philippe (centre) with Senate President G\u00e9rard Larcher (left) and then-National Assembly President Fran\u00e7ois de Rugy (right) on Armistice Day, 11 November 2017\nIn the June 2017 legislative elections, Macron's party, renamed \"La R\u00e9publique En Marche!\", together with its ally the Democratic Movement (MoDem), secured a comfortable majority, winning 350 seats out of 577, with his party alone winning an outright majority of 308 seats. Philippe is a member of The Republicans though he campaigned for La R\u00e9publique En Marche! due to the party supporting his role as Prime Minister. He formed the Second Philippe government on 21 May 2017 following a series of resignations after scandal embroiled Ministers Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, Sylvie Goulard, Marielle de Sarnez and Richard Ferrand. This diminished Democratic Movement's representation in the government significantly.[17][18][19][20]\n\n\nPhilippe secured a vote of confidence and was allowed to govern with a majority government on 4 July 2017. He was confirmed with a vote of 370 against 67.[21] Following the vote, Philippe addressed the parliament, talking about plans to tackle France's debt by raising cigarette tax and cutting spending.[22] Philippe also talked about plans to reduce corporate tax from 33.3% to 25% by 2022.[23] Philippe announced the government's labour reform plan which will give companies more power when it comes to negotiating conditions directly with their employees.[24] Labour reform was one of Macron's biggest election promises and has been seen as the government's biggest economic reform.[25]\n\n\nOn 12 July 2017, Philippe announced a new immigration plan. The plan attempts to speed up asylum claims from fourteen months to six, provide housing for 7,500 refugees by the end of 2019, improve living conditions for minors and deport economic migrants.[26][27] The draft of the law will be introduced in September.[28]\n\n\nOn 3 July 2020, Philippe resigned as Prime Minister.[29] He ran successfully in the 2020 Le Havre mayoral election.[30]\n\n\nIn October 2020, Philippe was one of several current and former government officials whose home was searched by French authorities following complaints about the government's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic in France.[31]\n\n\nAhead of the 2022 presidential election, Philippe endorsed Macron for reelection.[32]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nPhilippe is married to \u00c9dith Chabre, the executive director of the School of Law at Sciences Po.[33][34] They have three children.[35][36]\n\n\nSince the middle of the 2010s, Philippe has sported a short beard. He is the first Prime Minister with facial hair since Henri Queuille (Prime Minister in 1951) and the first one with a full beard since Alexandre Ribot (Prime Minister last in 1917). Further, he is one of a few Prime Ministers in the last century (Henri Queuille, Raymond Barre, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, Jean-Marc Ayrault) to be older than the president he served under, by an unprecedented seven years.\n\n\nAs Prime Minister, he announced that he had vitiligo, a skin disease responsible for the noticeable white patch of hair on his beard.[37]\n\n\n\n## Honours[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Ribbon bar | Honour | Date and comment\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | Grand Cross of the National Order of Merit | 22 November 2017 \u2013 by right as Prime Minister\n |\n| ![](image) | Grand Officer of the Order of the Legion of Honour | 2020\n |\n\n\n### Foreign honours[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Ribbon bar | Country | Honour | Date\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | Australia | Honorary Officer of the Order of Australia | 11 November 2018\n |\n| ![](image) | Senegal | Grand Cross of the Order of Merit | 2019\n |\n\n\n## Published works[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\u00c9douard Philippe dedicating *Impressions and clear lines* in Fontainebleau, on 29 June 2021.\nPhilippe has co-authored two works of fiction:\n\n\n\n* With Gilles Boyer (2007). *L'Heure de v\u00e9rit\u00e9*.

Steinmeier subsequently appealed successfully to the SPD to change their hard stance against coalition with the CDU/CSU, and the SPD agreed to a third grand coalition with the CDU/CSU.[165] The negotiations leading up to this agreement were the longest in German post-war history, lasting almost six months.[166][167]\n\n\nA YouGov survey published in late December 2017 found that just 36% of all respondents wanted Merkel to stay at the helm until 2021, while half of those surveyed voters called for a change at the top before the end of the legislature.[168]\n\n\nThe Fourth Merkel cabinet

The deal also increased the tax burden on employers and their publicly insured employees.[92][93] The 2006 round of reforms introduced the \"health insurance duty\", which establishes that individuals must be insured either through the public insurance system or through private insurance firms and accordingly cannot be uninsured.[94] The reforms also targeted preventive healthcare as a priority, particularly with regards to eldercare.[94]\n\n\n\n#### Eurozone crisis[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: European debt crisis and 2007\u20132008 financial crisis\n\nSee also: Greek government-debt crisis \u00a7\u00a0Germany's\\_role\\_in\\_Greece\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n67. **^** Chase, Jefferson (4 December 2021). \"Bavaria's Christian Social Union: What you need to know\". *dw.com*.

The diplomatic visit took place to discuss how their governments could improve conditions which caused people to flee those countries and how illegal migration through and from these countries could be reduced.[151]\n\n\nThe migrant crisis spurred right-wing electoral preferences across Germany with the Alternative for Germany (AfD) gaining 12% of the vote in the 2017 German federal election. These developments prompted debates over the reasons for increased right-wing populism in Germany. Some researchers have argued that increased right-wing preferences are a result of the European migrant crisis, particularly the increasingly common perception that refugees constitute an ethnic and cultural threat to Germany.[152]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![](image) FDP\n |\n| --- |\n| **Speaker:** Wolfgang Gerhardt\n |\n| * **Members:**\n* Addicks\n* Bahr\n* Br\u00fcderle\n* Brunkhorst\n* Burgbacher\n* Daub\n* Eberl\n* Essen\n* Flach\n* Fricke\n* Friedrich\n* Funke\n* Gerhardt\n* Goldmann\n* G\u00fcnther\n* Guttmacher\n* Happach-Kasan\n* Hartmann\n* Haupt\n* Heinrich\n* Homburger\n* Hoyer\n* Kauch\n* Kolb\n* K\u00f6nigshaus\n* Kopp\n* Koppelin\n* Kubicki\n* Laurischk\n* Leibrecht\n* Lenke\n* Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger\n* L\u00f6ning\n* M\u00f6llemann\n* Niebel\n* Nolting\n* Otto\n* Otto\n* Parr\n* Pieper\n* Piltz\n* Pinkwart\n* Rexrodt\n* Sehn\n* Solms\n* Stadler\n* Stinner\n* Terwiesche\n* Thiele\n* Thomae\n* T\u00fcrk\n* Westerwelle\n* Winterstein\n* Wissing\n* Wolf\n |\n\n |\n| OTHER | \n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nIndependent\n |\n| --- |\n| * **Members:**\n* L\u00f6tzsch\n* Pau\n |\n\n |\n| * List of members of the 15th Bundestag\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![](image) ![](image) Members of the 16th Bundestag (2005\u20132009)\n |\n| --- |\n| **President: Norbert Lammert (CDU)**\n |\n| CDU/CSU | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nheld enough seats to form a majority in the Bundestag.[85] A grand coalition between the CDU/CSU and SPD would face the challenge of both parties demanding the chancellorship.[85][86] However, after three weeks of negotiations, the two parties reached a deal for a grand coalition whereby Merkel would become Chancellor and the SPD would hold 8 of the 16 seats in the cabinet.[86] The deal was approved by both parties at party conferences on 14 November 2005.[87]\n\n\nMerkel was elected Chancellor by the majority of delegates (397 to 217) in the newly assembled Bundestag on 22 November 2005, but 51 members of the governing coalition voted against her.[88] Reports at the time indicated that the grand coalition would pursue a mix of policies, some of which differed from Merkel's political platform as leader of the opposition and candidate for Chancellor. The coalition's intent was to cut public spending whilst increasing VAT (from 16 to 19%), social insurance contributions and the top rate of income tax.[89]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n331. **^** \"Angela Merkel \u00fcber Kanzlerschaft und Ruhestand: \u00bbJetzt bin ich frei\u00ab\". *Der Spiegel* (in German). 18 June 2022.

The People's Party, led in Galicia by Manuel Fraga Iribarne, obtained a new absolute majority. The Socialist party increased its number of seats from 15 to 17, but, after several years of opposition the results were also considered bad.[48] These two negative results seemed to confirm that Zapatero's approach was not working.\n\n\nOn 19 December 2001 Zapatero travelled to Morocco, after the Moroccan government expelled the Spanish ambassador sine die. Javier Arenas, then secretary general of the People's Party, accused him of not being loyal to Spanish interests. Zapatero denied it and claimed that one of his purposes was to help solve the crisis.[49]\n\n\nIn 2002, Zapatero was chosen as the Socialist candidate for the next general election.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Constituency | Madrid |\n| **In office**9 July 1986\u00a0\u2013 2 August 2004 |\n| Constituency | Le\u00f3n |\n|  |\n| Personal details |\n| Born |  (1960-08-04) 4 August 1960 (age\u00a063)Valladolid, Castile and Le\u00f3n, Spain |\n| Political party | PSOE (since 1979) |\n| Spouse | \nSonsoles Espinosa\n\n\u200b\n \u200b\n(m.\u00a01990)\u200b\n |\n| Children | 2 |\n| Alma mater | University of Le\u00f3n |\n| Signature | ![](image) |\n|  |\n\n\n**Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero** (Spanish: [xose\u02c8lwis ro\u02c8\u00f0\u027ei\u0263e\u03b8 \u03b8apa\u02c8te\u027eo] \u24d8;[1] born 4 August 1960) is a Spanish politician and member of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE). He was the Prime Minister of Spain being elected for two terms, in the 2004 and 2008 general elections.[2] On 2 April 2011 he announced he would not stand for re-election in the 2011 general election and left office on 21 December 2011.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe theory that the bombing affected the result is a counterfactual that cannot be verified. As elections in European states hinge on social and economic policies mainly, it is equally possible the terrorist events had no notable effect. In this regard, a majority of 74%[70] of the Spanish people were against Spanish involvement in the war.\n\n\nOn 13 June 2004 (three months after the General Election) the Election for the European Parliament took place. The Socialist Party tied with 25 seats vs 25 for the People's Party (out of 54), but narrowly won in popular vote. Although Jos\u00e9 Borrell was the official candidate, Zapatero played an important role in that campaign (as is usual in Spain).\n\n\n\n## Premiership[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Styles of**Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero** |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| Reference style | *Excelent\u00edsimo Se\u00f1or (Don)* |\n| Spoken style | *Se\u00f1or Presidente* |\n| Alternative style | *Se\u00f1or* Zapatero, *Don* Jos\u00e9 Luis |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n76. **^** \"Unos 12.000 millones de euros en ayudas para m\u00e1s de un mill\u00f3n de personas dependientes\". *20 Minutos*. 20 April 2006.

After signing the treaty in Rome together with other leaders, he decided to call for a referendum, which was held on 20 February 2005. It was the first referendum on the EU treaty, a fact highly publicized by Zapatero's government. A 'Yes' vote was supported by the Socialist Party and the People's Party and as a result almost 77% voted in favour of the European Constitution, but turnout was around 43%. However, this result came to nothing when a referendum in France voted to reject the European Constitution which meant that the EU could not ratify the treaty because support was not unanimous.\n\n\n\n#### Presidency of the Council of the European Union[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt end of 2003 and the beginning of 2004 the Spanish political parties started to prepare themselves for the general election of 2004.

For the first time, the opinion polls showed that most Spaniards believed that the then Spanish Prime Minister had been the winner (Zapatero had always been considered the winner since his first debate in 2001).\n\n\nLater, in October, a regional election took place in Catalonia, whose results were worse than expected for the Socialist Party. As most of the Autonomous communities of Spain hold the elections to their assemblies the same day, with the exception of Andalusia, Catalonia, Galicia and the Basque Country, coinciding with the municipal elections all over Spain, the results are hugely significant.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter becoming Secretary General, he was congratulated by the French PM Lionel Jospin, by the German Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der and by Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar.[36]\n\n\nHe moved to Madrid with his family that year. As a Congressman he had lived from Monday to Thursday in Madrid and the rest of the time in Le\u00f3n.[37]\n\n\n\n### Opposition leader[edit]\n\n\nThis was the period when Zapatero was appointed as Secretary General of the PSOE in 2000 until he became Prime Minister of Spain on 14 March 2004.\n\n\nZapatero has always claimed to base his political activity on his love of dialogue. When he was an opposition leader, he liked to contrast his behaviour with the \"arrogant\", \"authoritarian\" approach of the People's Party and, especially, that of its leader Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** In *Diccionario panhisp\u00e1nico de dudas*, acento, it is said explicitly that *Jos\u00e9 Luis* is pronounced [joselu\u00eds], i.e. IPA: [xose\u02c8lwis, -\u02c8lwiz].

Its mission was to help him to become prime minister. Among its members: Jos\u00e9 Bono (his ex-rival for the Secretaryship of the party and later appointed Minister of Defence), Juan Carlos Rodr\u00edguez Ibarra (president of the regional government of Extremadura and one of the most important socialist leaders), Miguel \u00c1ngel Moratinos (his minister of foreign affairs 2004\u20132010), Gregorio Peces-Barba (later appointed by him High Commissioner for the Victims of Terrorism, although he has already made public his resignation), Carmen Calvo (later appointed minister of culture), etc.[59]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 25 May 2003, the first local and regional elections since Zapatero's appointment as leader of the Socialist party were held. The Socialist Party received a larger popular vote (which prompted Zapatero to claim his party had been the winner) but the People's Party obtained more posts in councils and regional governments. In general, there were not many changes in the results compared to those of the previous Elections held in 1999. The Socialists lost the Balearic Islands but got enough votes in Madrid to govern through a coalition with the communists of the United Left. The \"victory\" was welcomed by Zapatero, as the winner in Madrid had always won the next general election. However, an unexpected scandal, the so-called Madrid Assembly Scandal, negatively affected the socialist expectations of a victory in 2004.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the meeting of the European Union Justice and Home Affairs Ministers held in Tampere on 22 September 2006, some of the European ministers reprimanded the Spanish authorities for the aforementioned massive regularisation of undocumented immigrants which was regarded as too loose and opposed to the policies of other State members (on 2 September and 3 alone, during the height of the last illegal immigration wave, 2,283 people arrived illegally in the Canary Islands having shipped from Senegal aboard 27 pirogues).[96][97]\n\n\n\n### Foreign policy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gaddafi with Spanish Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero at the third EU-Africa Summit in Tripoli in November 2010.\n#### Iraq[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs the demonstrations escalated, Mariano Rajoy himself appeared on national TV to denounce the illegal demonstrations. In reply, both Jos\u00e9 Blanco and Alfredo P\u00e9rez Rubalcaba broke the silence from the Socialist Party's side, in separate appearances. In the end both sides accused each other of breaking the electoral law on reflection day.\n\n\nIn this climate of social unrest and post-attack shock, the elections were held on 14 March 2004. Zapatero's Socialist Party won the elections, with 164 seats in the Cortes, while the People's Party obtained 148. It seems likely that the election result was influenced to a greater or lesser extent by the Spanish public's response to the attacks[68] and the informative coverage by the different media and political parties.

To safeguard dependents, a board was established that estimates for each person based on their disability what they are entitled to, as a right. Equally, people required to stay at home to look after the disabled are entitled to a dependency salary. In regards to migrants, 700,000 were granted amnesty in the first year of the Zapatero Government. Steps were also taken to address the vulnerability of people on temporary work contracts, making it more difficult for employers to fire at will and easier for workers to get mortgages.[79]\n\n\n\n### Economic problems[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Zapatero having a break during a parliamentary session with some fellow PSOE MPs in 1988.\nIn 1986, he was elected to represent the province of Le\u00f3n in the Cortes (Parliament), becoming its youngest member after the election held on 20 June. He was number two on the PSOE list for Le\u00f3n.[19] In the following elections (those held in 1989, 1993, 1996 and 2000) he was number one on the list. In the elections of 2004 he ran for Madrid as number one.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the 2007 Ibero\u2013American Summit, Ch\u00e1vez called Zapatero's predecessor Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar a fascist for allegedly supporting the 2002 coup attempt. Zapatero used his speaking time to defend Aznar, noting that he was \"democratically elected by the Spanish people.\" Ch\u00e1vez kept trying to interrupt Zapatero, even as summit organisers turned off his microphone. King Juan Carlos, who was seated beside Zapatero, attempted to rebuke Ch\u00e1vez, but was stopped by Zapatero who, displaying significant patience, told him to wait a moment. When Ch\u00e1vez continued to interrupt Zapatero, Juan Carlos, in a rare outburst of anger, asked Ch\u00e1vez \"\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no te callas?\" (Why don't you shut up?). The king left the hall shortly afterwards when the President of Nicaragua began to criticize the Spanish government as well. Zapatero continued to participate in the negotiations, later delivering, to loud applause, a speech demanding respect for the leaders of other countries.\n\n\n\n#### United States[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhile Zapatero complained about Gibraltar's celebrations for the tricentenary of British rule and rejected the Gibraltarians' requests for Spain to recognise their right to self-determination, at the end of 2004 his policy changed and he became the first Spanish prime minister to accept the participation of Gibraltar as a partner on the same level as Spain and the United Kingdom in discussions both countries hold regularly concerning the territory. The decision was criticized by many in Spain as a surrender of their claim to sovereignty over Gibraltar as well as an alleged disruption of the Treaty of Utrecht. Zapatero said it was a new way to solve a 300-year-old issue.\n\n\n\n### Israel[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: 2006 Franco\u2013Italian\u2013Spanish Middle East Peace Plan\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA regional election was held in the Basque Country on 13 May 2001. The socialists received 17.8% of the vote (against 17.6% in the previous 1998 elections) but lost one seat. Both, the Socialist Party and the People's Party had formed an alliance against the then ruling nationalist Basque political movements but the latter won again. The results were considered a failure.[45] Nicol\u00e1s Redondo Terreros, the Basque Socialist leader during the election who was strongly opposed to Basque nationalism and to ETA, resigned after some internal clashes, resigning his seat in the Basque parliament and in the Federal Executive. He was replaced by Patxi L\u00f3pez, elected on 24 March 2002.[46] L\u00f3pez had actively supported Zapatero during his campaign to become Secretary General.[47]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1996, after the General Election, Zapatero kept his seat at the Congress of Deputies. The following year, Zapatero was again elected Secretary General of Le\u00f3n and after the national conference held by the party that year he entered the National Executive (the party's governing body).[27]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTen days later, on 18 January 2004, Zapatero announced that he would only become prime minister if the Spanish Socialist Workers Party received a plurality, renouncing possible parliamentary alliances in advance if that situation did not happen after the election. Minority parties (especially United Left, a communist party) criticized the decision, for they considered it an attempt to attract their own voters, who would rather ensure a defeat of the People's Party even at the expense of voting for an unfavorable party.[60]\n\n\nZapatero's slogan became \"we deserve a better Spain\", which was coupled with \"Zapatero Presidente\", or \"(ZP)\", which became a popular nickname of the then Spanish Prime Minister.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n125. **^** \"Condecorados: Orden El Sol del Per\u00fa\" (PDF). *cde.gestion2.e3.pe*.

The Popular Party contended that Zapatero lacked a coherent economic plan and stated \"There is no tax increase capable of filling the hole that you have created\". On 23 June 2008 Zapatero announced 21 reforms designed to aid economic recovery in a speech pointedly avoiding popular terms of the period such as 'crisis'.[*citation needed*] Although government deficits were projected to increase to 10% of GDP, Zapatero promised to reduce it to 3% required by EU policy by 2012.[80]\n\n\nIn January 2011 Spain's Unemployment Rate had risen to 20.33% exceeding his target rate of 19.4%.[81]\n\n\n\n### LGBT rights[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the end of March 2005, Zapatero travelled to Venezuela to sign a deal to sell military ships and aircraft to Venezuela worth around US$1\u00a0billion. The US government attempted to intervene but failed, accusing Venezuela of being a \"dangerous country.\"\n\n\nAfter the election of Evo Morales in Bolivia, Spain was one of the countries the new president visited during his first international tour.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2002, the People's Party Government decided to reform the system of unemployment benefits, as it thought that there were too many workers who being able to find a job preferred to continue receiving public money. This led to a redefinition of those who were eligible for unemployment benefits. Left-wing parties and trade unions considered that redefinition an unacceptable reduction of rights. Zapatero became the political leader of the opposition against the reform (dubbed the *Decretazo*, because it was passed using a decree-law), which served him as his first important clash with Aznar's government.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Zapatero along with some of the Government, 2011.\nJust after he took office, Zapatero repealed the law reforming the Education System passed by the previous government and, in November 2005, introduced his own reform bill. The bill was opposed by the People's Party, the Catholic Church, the Muslim community, The Catholic Confederation of Parents' Associations and an important part of the educational community, often for disparate reasons. Complaints against the reform include the limits it imposes upon parents' freedom to choose a school, the decrease in academic status of voluntary religious education, the introduction of a compulsory course (\"Education for Citizenship\") and a perceived ineffectiveness of the reform in terms of combating poor educational results. The last complaint would be reinforced by the opinion that Spain has ranked poorly amongst the developed countries in the quality and results of its education.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 17 March 2005, Zapatero's government ordered the removal of the last remaining statue of former dictator Francisco Franco that remained in Madrid.[86]\n\n\nThe measures taken have been criticized as an over-correction by the opposition arguing that the Historical Memory Law of 2007 reopens old wounds and has been taken advantage of by certain groups to present a unilateral version of the war which focuses solely on the crimes of one side whilst widely ignoring those of the other.\n\n\n\n### Reform of the education system[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2001 one of the biggest points of friction between the government and the opposition were the proposed reforms affecting the education system. The People's Party first introduced the so-called LOU, a law to change the university system, and later the LOCE (*Organic Act for Education Quality*), which affected secondary education. Zapatero strongly opposed both. The People's Party used its absolute majority in the Cortes to pass its reforms.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nZapatero condemned the 2006 Lebanon War. Zapatero issued a statement saying that \"From my point of view, Israel is wrong. One thing is self defense, and the other is to launch a counter offensive consisting on a general attack in Lebanon and Gaza that is just going to further escalate violence in the area\".[109][110]\n\n\n\n### 2008 election[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Spanish general election, 2008\n\nOn 9 March 2008, Zapatero's Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) won the general election with 44% of the votes.[111] Two days earlier, on 7 March, Isa\u00edas Carrasco, a PSOE Basque politician was shot dead in what is believed to be an attack by ETA, and which resulted in the agreed canceling of the final days of the campaign.[112][113]\n\n\n\n## Post-Premiership[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* The attacks themselves might have changed the electoral winner. A sufficient number of voters suddenly decided to vote for the Socialist party because they thought that if it won, Islamist terrorism would be placated.[*citation needed*]\n* The handling of the attacks by the government, rather than the attacks themselves, might have changed the electoral winner. People who had the perception that the information about the attacks was being manipulated decided to vote the Socialist party as a response.[*citation needed*]\n* The attacks might have changed the result but not the winner. The Socialist Party was going to win but with fewer votes. (Despite this claim, most polls before the attacks gave a victory to Mariano Rajoy.)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 12 March 2000, the PSOE had lost its second successive election to Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar's People's Party. Zapatero held his seat, but the Socialist Party obtained only 125 seats, 16 fewer than in 1996. The defeat was especially bitter as the People's Party unexpectedly obtained an absolute majority for the first time and the socialist result was worse than in the previous election. Almunia announced his resignation on the very day the General Election took place.\n\n\nZapatero decided to run for the leadership of the Socialist Party in its 35th Conference to be held in June that year. Together with other socialist members, he founded a new faction within the party called *Nueva V\u00eda* (New Way) in April 2000, to serve him as a platform to become Secretary General. The name of *Nueva V\u00eda* was a mix of Tony Blair's *Third Way* (*tercera v\u00eda* in Spanish) and Gerhard Schr\u00f6der's *Neue Mitte* (*new center* or *nuevo centro* in Spanish).[30]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Regional wings | * Andalusia\n* Aragon\n* Asturias\n* Balearic Islands\n* Basque Country\n* Canary Islands\n* Cantabria\n* Castile and Le\u00f3n\n* Castilla\u2013La Mancha\n* Catalonia\n* Extremadura\n* Galicia\n* La Rioja\n* Madrid\n* Murcia\n* Navarre\n* Valencian Community\n |\n| Affiliated organisations | * Socialist Youth of Spain\n* IDEAS Foundation for progress\n* *El Socialista*\n* Socialist Left\n |\n| Former affiliated organisations | * Catalan Federation of the PSOE\n* Socialists of Catalonia\n* People's Socialist Party\n* Democratic Action Party\n* Democratic Party of the New Left\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter the Madrid election, the People's Party lacked two seats to obtain an absolute majority. This seemed to allow an alliance of Socialists and the United Left to seize power. But an unexpected event happened. Eduardo Tamayo and Mar\u00eda Teresa S\u00e1ez, two Socialist Assembly Members (AMs) angry at the distribution of power in the future regional government between the United Left and the Socialist Party, started a crisis that led to a re-run of the Election in Madrid in October 2003 with the subsequent victory of the People's Party.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA General Strike was announced for 20 June 2002 (the first since Aznar won the election in 1996). Although, according to official data (including the electrical power consumption and the number of working days calculated by the Social Security), the turnout was lower than 15%, the lowest since the restoration of democracy, neither the unions nor Zapatero believed the data and considered the strike a resounding success,[*citation needed*] with more than \"10 million\" workers having followed the strike. Whatever the result, both the People's Party government and the trade unions signed an agreement that satisfied both parties in November.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section of a biography of a living person **needs additional citations for verification**.

Zapatero played an important role in the improvement of the relationship between the Cuban government and the European Union.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nZapatero later told a *New York Times* reporter off the record that he had a \"certain consideration\" for Bush, because \"I recognise that my electoral success has been influenced by his governing style\", i.e., that Bush was so unpopular in Spain that he helped Zapatero win in 2004 and 2008.[104]\n\n\nIn March 2009, Spain announced that it would withdraw its forces from Kosovo. US State Department spokesman Robert Wood issued unusually strong criticism by stating that the United States was \"deeply disappointed\" by the decision. He said that Washington only learned of the move shortly before Spain announced it publicly. Spanish Defense Minister Carme Chacon made the announcement saying, \"The mission has been completed and it is time to return home.\" Asked if the United States shared that assessment, Wood said, \"Not at all.\"[105] Later on, Vice President Joe Biden stated that the American relationship with Spain goes beyond \"whatever disagreement we may have over Kosovo\".[106]\n\n\n\n#### Europe[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe National Conference (held after most of the representatives elected in the first Le\u00f3n Conference were Zapatero's supporters) was won by the *reformers*, at that time strongly opposed to the *Guerristas*. That was positive for Zapatero as the list of bogus party members was revised again. Their number grew from 577 to almost 900.[24]\n\n\nZapatero was finally reelected secretary general with 68% of the ballots in the 7th Regional Conference held in July 1994, following the removal of the false memberships.[25]\n\n\nIn 1995, new regional and local elections were held. The results were bad for the PSOE in Le\u00f3n as they lost four seats in the mayoralty of Le\u00f3n and two seats in the regional parliament of Castilla-Le\u00f3n. The results were influenced by the bad economic situation and the cases of corruption assailing the party. Zapatero had personally directed the electoral campaign.[26]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n91. **^** \"Zapatero: \"He ordenado suspender todas las iniciativas para desarrollar el di\u00e1logo con ETA\"\". *El Pa\u00eds*. 30 December 2006.

He pasted posters of both parties.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nZapatero's social-democratic project of *Nueva V\u00eda* (\"New Way\") was based to a substantial degree on the republicanism of Philip Pettit (\"freedom as non-domination\").[123] Branded domestically as *socialismo c\u00edvico*, his initial vision was underpinned by the extension of minority rights, the strengthening of the welfare state, a contrast between \"constitutional patriotism\" and \"nationalism\", the widening of spaces for deliberation and the defence of international organizations and multilateralism.[123]\n\n\n\n## Decorations[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | This list is incomplete; you can help by adding missing items. *(November 2019)*\n |\n\n\n* Honorary Doctorat of the Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse Capitole 1 (2015)[124]\n* Grand Cross of the Order of the Sun of Peru (2004)[125]\n* Grand Cross of the Order of Christ (2006)[126]\n* Grand Cross of the Order of the Liberator San Mart\u00edn (2009)[127]\n* Collar of the Order of Isabella the Catholic (2011)[128]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Viva Zapatero!\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nZapatero defined himself as a \"left-wing conservative\" at the time. He explained that he meant that, for sentimental reasons linked to his family, he came from the left that lost the Spanish Civil War and that what had happened between 1936 and 1939 (the duration of the war) and 1939\u20131975 (Franco's regime) had a very important significance for him. He further explained that the Spanish left needed to modernize and that \"we are finding it difficult to accept the need for the Socialist Party to change many of its ideological parameters and overcome our own conservatism\".[20]\n\n\nIn 1988 he became Secretary General in Le\u00f3n after a complex internal fight for power that ended a long period of division. In fact, before the provincial conference held that year, Ram\u00f3n Rubial, then national president of the PSOE, had asked the party in Le\u00f3n to foster unity. Zapatero was elected as Secretary General at that conference, leading to a period of stability.[21]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n69. **^** Matthews, Owen. \"International Periscope & Perspectives \u2013 Newsweek: International Editions\".

Josep Borrell also decided to support him.[33]\n\n\nZapatero ran against three other opponents (Jos\u00e9 Bono, Rosa D\u00edez and Matilde Fern\u00e1ndez).[34] Matilde Fern\u00e1ndez was the candidate of the *guerristas* while Jos\u00e9 Bono was the candidate of the *reformers*. Rosa D\u00edez was a Basque politician who was a kind of intermediate option at the time.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 26 May 2003 a Yakovlev Yak-42 plane carrying Spanish soldiers home from Afghanistan crashed in Turkey. The plane had been hired by an agency of NATO. Zapatero blamed Aznar and his government for neglecting aspects like the plane insurance or safety. Further, Aznar had rejected calls for a full inquiry into the crash.[54] After the 2004 March elections it was proven that there had been serious irregularities in the identification of the corpses resulting in a high number of mistakes.[54][55]\n\n\nConcerning the European Constitution, Zapatero criticized the People's Party Government for fighting to preserve the distribution of power agreed by the 2001 Treaty of Nice in the new Constitution. Zapatero thought that Spain should accept a lesser share of power.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBacked by UNASUR, Zapatero was promoted to a role as mediator in Venezuela in 2016.[120] As a results of the conversations he took part in, the so-called \"Acuerdo de Convivencia Democr\u00e1tica por Venezuela\" (endorsed by Zapatero and Danilo Medina) was proposed in February 2018 so it could be ratified by the parts in conflict. However, the document (tentatively trying to set a roadmap for legislative elections, respect for the rule of law, a plan to improve the economic situation and a reparatory truth commission) was accepted by the Venezuelan government but rejected by the opposition Democratic Unity Roundtable (MUD).[121]\n\n\nIn 2019, Zapatero joined the inaugural meeting of the so-called Puebla Group in Buenos Aires, a conference of left-leaning political leaders.[122]\n\n\n\n## Ideology[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMuch of Zapatero's work has been on social issues, including gender-motivated violence and discrimination,[73] divorce[74] and same-sex marriage.[75] The most recent social issue tackled has been the Dependency Law,[76] a plan to regulate help and resources for people in dire need of them, and who cannot provide for themselves and must rely on others on a daily basis. Zapatero has also made it clear that he values funding of research and development and higher education and believes them to be essential for Spain's economic competitiveness. At the same time, he increased the minimum wage and pursued other socialist policies. Scholarships were made available to all, and young adults received rent subsidies called \u201cemancipation\u201d money. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe campaign had ended abruptly two days before it was expected to convene as a result of the bombings. The day before the elections \u2013 in this case 13 March 2004 \u2013 is considered to be a \"Day of Reflection\" under Spanish electoral law, with candidates and their parties legally barred from political campaigning. Despite this prohibition, numerous demonstrations took place against the government of Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar in front of the premises of the People's Party all over Spain. There were some claims that most of these demonstrations were instigated or orchestrated by the Socialist Party, through the use of SMS text messaging from mobile phones belonging to the Socialist Party. The Socialist Party publicly denied these accusations.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n38. **^** Mart\u00ed, Jos\u00e9 Luis; Pettit, Philip (2010). \"The Spanish Context\" (PDF). *A Political Philosophy in Public Life: Civic Republicanism in Zapatero's Spain*.

Two days before, Zapatero had predicted a historic victory for the Socialists' Party of Catalonia and the beginning of the People's Party defeat. The Socialist Party won the election in popular vote but CiU obtained more MPs due to the electoral law. The final results were 46 seats for Convergence and Union (CiU) (ten fewer than in 1999, the year of the previous election), 42 for the Socialist Party (ten fewer), 15 for the People's Party (three more), 9 for Iniciativa per Catalunya-Verds and 23 (nine more) for the Republican Left of Catalonia. Zapatero attributed the bad results to the consequences of the crisis of Madrid. However, Maragall became the President of the Regional Government after a Pact with Republican Left of Catalonia and Iniciativa per Catalunya-Verds.[58]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAmong the main actions taken by the Zapatero administration were the withdrawal of Spanish troops from the Iraq war, the increase of Spanish troops in Afghanistan; the idea of an Alliance of Civilizations; the legalisation of same-sex marriage in Spain; reform of abortion law; a peace negotiation attempt with ETA; the end of ETA terrorism; increase of tobacco restrictions; and the reform of various autonomous statutes, particularly the Statute of Catalonia.\n\n\n\n\n## Biography[edit]\n\n\n### Family background and early life[edit]\n\n\nJos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero was born in Valladolid, Castile and Le\u00f3n, to Juan Rodr\u00edguez y Garc\u00eda-Lozano (born 1928), a lawyer, and Mar\u00eda de la Purificaci\u00f3n Zapatero Valero (Tordehumos, Valladolid, 1927 \u2013 Madrid, 30 October 2000).

This has been called the \"4 March theory\" (that is, if the election had been scheduled for 7 March, the attacks would have taken place on 4 March) by Aznar, among others. No definitive data exists in favour of that possibility but some facts have been used to support it. Thus, the first question Jamal Zougam (one of the first arrested suspects) made when he arrived at the Courthouse on 15 March 2004 was: 'Who won the election?'.[69]\n\n\nHow the bombing influenced the results is widely debated. The three schools of thought are:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe relations between Zapatero and former U.S. president George W. Bush were difficult, mostly as a result of Zapatero's opposition to the Iraq War.\n\n\nOn 12 October 2003, during the Fiesta Nacional de Espa\u00f1a military parade held in Madrid, then opposition leader and presidential candidate Zapatero remained seated as a U.S. Marine Corps honour guard carrying the American flag walked past Zapatero and other VIPs. Everybody else stood as with the rest of the foreign guest armies representations.[100] He declared afterwards that his action was a protest against the war and certainly not intended as an insult to the American people.\n\n\nLater on, during an official visit to Tunisia shortly after Zapatero was elected, he asked all of the countries with troops in Iraq to withdraw their soldiers. This declaration moved Bush to send a letter expressing discontent to the Spanish premier.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn May 1994 two papers, *El Pa\u00eds* and *Diario de Le\u00f3n*, published several articles that suggested irregularities in his appointment as a teaching assistant by the University of Le\u00f3n and in his keeping the job until 1991. The suspicions of political favoritism were due to his having been directly appointed without a prior selection process open to other candidates. On 20 May 1994, he held a press conference where he rejected these accusations. Zapatero attributed to \"ignorance\" or \"bad faith\" the content of the articles and linked them to the internal fight for the job of Secretary General of the Regional Chapter.[23]\n\n\nIn 1994, three regional conferences were held: All of them were finally won by Zapatero or his supporters.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn November 2002, the oil tanker *Prestige* suffered an accident in international waters[52] off the coast of Galicia causing a grave oil slick which mainly affected Galicia, but also, to a lesser degree all the northern coast of Spain, and even the coast of France. The *Prestige* finally split and sank.\n\n\nZapatero blamed the Government's handling of the events during and after the accident.[53]\n\n\nThe main point of friction between Aznar and Zapatero, however, was the war in Iraq. Opinion polls showed that a clear majority of Spanish voters (around 90%) were against the U.S.-led attack against Saddam Hussein's regime.[*citation needed*] Among them, Zapatero who considered any action against Saddam's regime to be illegal and was opposed to the very concept of preemptive war.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2007, Zapatero's government was also responsible for a Gender Identity Law that allows transgender persons the right to have their identity legally recognised, the criteria being one clinical evaluation and two years of treatment (generally hormone replacement therapy), and without demanding mandatory genital surgery or irreversible sterility. The law is, along with the legislation of some US states, one of the most simple and non-bureaucratic that currently exist in the world. Transgender persons also have the right to marry persons of the opposite or same sex they have transitioned into, and to biologically parent children either before or after transitioning.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Regional territorial tensions[edit]\n\n\nZapatero has often declared that his government will not be \"soft on terrorism\", and will not allow regional nationalists to endanger Spanish unity.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 11 March 2004 the most deadly peacetime attacks in Spanish history took place. Several commuter trains were bombed, causing 191 deaths and outrage all over Spain. The attacks took place three days before the General Election and all electoral activities were suspended. The common sorrow, instead of promoting unity among Spaniards, increased the already bitter tone of the campaign.[63]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHis style's defining word is *(buen) talante*, roughly \"pleasantness\", \"niceness\" or \"good disposition\", which is in brisk and carefully chosen contrast with the more confrontational and brusque premiership style of previous Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar. Similarly, Zapatero has been quoted to shy away from adopting unpopular measures, having a \"habit of showering public money on any problem\" and, in all, being \"averse to tough decisions\".[71]\n\n\n\n### Withdrawal from Iraq[edit]\n\n\nOne of the first measures he carried out as soon as he took office was to withdraw every Spanish soldier fighting in Iraq, calling the invasion of that country \"an error based on lies\".[72] In less than a month, his nation's 1,300 troops were withdrawn from Iraq. This drew criticism from the right, who held the view that he was ceding to the pressure of the terrorists who attacked Spain. However, it was a measure announced by him before the general elections and supported by the majority of Spanish population.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAmerican troops were subsequently instructed to not take part during the traditional military parade on the Spanish national holiday in 2004 and in 2005, something which they used to, as both the Spanish and American armies, being NATO allies, are part of joint humanitarian missions; American troops returned to the military parade in 2006; this time Zapatero, being the Spanish premier, stood.[101]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn May 2002, Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez declared in reference to the change in the Socialist Party that \"My state of mind tells me that a change has taken place, that perhaps a second Suresnes [*citation needed*] has happened, but it has yet to be proved that a new project with content and ideas really exists\", thus doubting Zapatero's leadership. That declaration was expressed in a public event also attended by Zapatero, who calmly expressed his disagreement. Gonz\u00e1lez ended his intervention by remembering that his candidate for Secretary General was Jos\u00e9 Bono, not Zapatero. Gonz\u00e1lez backtracked the next day, declaring that either his words had been incorrectly construed or he had expressed his ideas erroneously. Jos\u00e9 Bono himself confirmed his total support for Zapatero.[50] The incident seemed to confirm that Zapatero's strategy was not working.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nZapatero attended his first political rally, organized by the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) in Gij\u00f3n in 1976. Some political parties had been legal since 21 July 1976, but the PSOE was not legalized until February 1977. The speech of Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez, the PSOE leader and future Prime Minister of Spain, who took part in the rally, exerted an important influence on Zapatero. He said, among other things, that \"the Socialists' goal was the seizure of power by the working class to transform the ownership of the means of production\" and that \"the PSOE was a revolutionary party but not *revolutionarist* or *aventurist* [...], as it defended the use of elections to come to power\".[15]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 13 November 2003, in a rally in Barcelona during the election campaign that took Pasqual Maragall to power in the Generalitat, Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero gave a famous promise to approve the Statute of Catalonia:\n\n\n\n\n> I will support the reform of the Statute of Catalonia that the Parliament of Catalonia approves.[84]\n> \n> \n\n\nIn October 2005, a controversial[85] proposal to reform the Catalan statute arrived at the Spanish parliament after being passed in Catalonia. Zapatero, who had often expressed his support for a change of the statute (although he did not entirely support the draft passed by the Catalan Parliament), supported the reform.\n\n\n\n### Legacy of the Civil War and Francoism[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2004, Zapatero's government undertook the task of morally and legally rehabilitating those who were suppressed during and after the Spanish Civil War, by instituting a Memorial Commission chaired by Vice-Prime Minister Mar\u00eda Teresa Fern\u00e1ndez de la Vega.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCampaign promises\n* 180,000 new houses every year to buy or to rent\n* Preservation of a balanced budget with no deficit but with a more flexible approach than that of the People's Party\n* Bilingual education (English and Spanish, together with the official regional language in the areas where it existed)\n* A computer for every two students\n* A two-year maximum for legal processes or financial compensation\n* Further investment in research and development\n* Make the state-owned television company more independent from the government by making its director answerable to parliament, etc.[61]).[62]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 22 October 2002 Zapatero spoke in the name of the Socialist Party during the debate about the National Budget. Initially, Jordi Sevilla was to have been the Socialist spokesman but, at the last moment, he was replaced in a surprise move. When Jordi Sevilla, after being called by the speaker, had already descended to the floor of the Congress of Deputies, Zapatero said to him \"let me do it\" and climbed to the orator platform. Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar and other members of the People's Party had previously criticized him for not representing his party in the debate, suggesting a lack of the necessary political skills. Although the People's Party considered his action too theatrical, it seems it had quite a positive effect on his supporters.[51]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1993, the Socialist Federation of Le\u00f3n (FSL \u2013 Federaci\u00f3n Socialista de Le\u00f3n) suffered an important scandal. Some towns experienced unusually sharp increases in PSOE membership in a very short period of time. When some of the supposed new members were questioned by the press, they stated that they were unaware of their membership and that they did not live in the places where they were being registered by the party. It seems that some opponents of Zapatero in Le\u00f3n, perhaps with the support of powerful *Guerristas* at the top of the Spanish Socialist Party wanted to increase their influence within it by increasing the number of members in the towns of Le\u00f3n favorable to them. Their main aim would have been to take control of the Regional Socialist Section of Castilla y Le\u00f3n in the conference to be held in 1994. Zapatero's support for the then Regional Secretary General, Jes\u00fas Quijano transformed him into the enemy of the *Guerristas* in the region as the FSL is the most important Provincial Section.[22]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the PSOE consisted of two factions: the *Guerristas* (supporters of Alfonso Guerra, former vice-president under Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez) and the reformers (led by Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez). The first group had a stronger left-wing ideology whereas the second was more pragmatic. The division became wider after the General Election of 1993, the last election won by the PSOE before Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar's victory in 1996, when the bad results exacerbated the internal conflicts. Zapatero never formally joined either of those two groups.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Authority control databases ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n |\n| --- |\n| International | * FAST\n* ISNI\n* VIAF\n* WorldCat\n |\n| National | * Spain\n* France\n* BnF data\n* Catalonia\n* Germany\n* Italy\n* Israel\n* Belgium\n* United States\n* Czech Republic\n* Netherlands\n* Poland\n* Portugal\n |\n| People | * Deutsche Biographie\n |\n| Other | * IdRef\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOne of the most important points of friction was the absence of televised debates between the candidates. Zapatero was the first to propose a debate to Mariano Rajoy. Rajoy accepted on the condition that Zapatero could not be alone but accompanied at least by two of his potential allies after the election: Gaspar Llamazares (the leader of United Left) and Josep-Llu\u00eds Carod-Rovira (leader of Republican Left of Catalonia). Rajoy justified his decision on the grounds that, in his opinion, he was not running against the Socialist Party but against a \"coalition\" of forces opposed to the People's Party's policies. Zapatero never formally responded to this proposal and throughout the campaign he continued criticizing what he always defined as Rajoy's reluctance to defend his political program face-to-face. (Zapatero has promised to change electoral law to make televised debates compulsory.)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the campaign, Zapatero harshly criticized the People's Party for its management of the *Prestige* crisis, its attitude towards the invasion of Iraq and the high cost of housing. Mariano Rajoy, the new leader of the People's Party after Aznar's voluntary retirement, on his part, attacked Zapatero's foreseeable future alliances with parties like United Left or Republican Left of Catalonia (a pro-Independence Catalan party).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFollowing this, Zapatero gave orders to halt initiatives leading to negotiations with ETA.[91] Demonstrations across Spain followed the next day, most condemning the attack, others condemning the Government's policies and a minority even questioning the authorship of the Madrid bombings.[92]\n\n\nA massive rally in Madrid followed on 25 February 2007 promoted by the Victims of Terrorism Association (AVT in Spanish acronym), rejecting what are perceived to be concessions from the government to the separatists.[93]\n\n\nOn 10 March 2007, a new massive rally was held in Madrid, gathering - depending on the source's relationships to the government - between 342,000 and over two million people.[94] This demonstration was organized by the opposition party PP and backed by the AVT and several other associations of victims, to not allow I\u00f1aki de Juana Chaos out of prison and accusing Zapatero's government of surrendering to terrorism.[95]\n\n\n\n### Immigration[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Informational notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** In his speech, he stated what can be considered his declaration of principles:[32]\n\n\t1. To build a society that would accept all foreigners notwithstanding their color or cultural background.\n\t2. To give priority to education and to create good jobs for youngsters.\n\t3. To provide parents with more time to spend with their children and in taking care of their elders.\n\t4. To promote culture and its creators, making it possible for them to grab the spotlight from those aiming only at economic interests.\n\t5. To convert Spain into a country admired for helping those with more needs.\n\t6. To force the government to help those with initiative and enterprising qualities.\n\t7. To foster democracy, to lend distinction to politics and to promote values over temporary interests.\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nZapatero was a *dark horse* who had against him his inexperience and in favour his image of reform and being the only MP among the candidates. (All the Spanish opposition leaders had been MPs before winning the elections. A very important factor in Spanish politics where electoral campaigns last for only 15 days and to be widely known long before they begin is essential.) Bono was deeply disliked by the *guerristas*, who also favoured Zapatero.\n\n\nZapatero finally won by a relatively small margin (he obtained 414 votes out of 995 and Jos\u00e9 Bono obtained 405) on 22 July 2000.[35] The margin was relatively small because Bono had no likelihood of winning since the supporters of the other two candidates preferred Zapatero as their second choice. Zapatero accepted the cancellation of a run-off between himself and Bono because he was sure of his victory after only one ballot and he apparently did not want to humiliate his adversary.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe main criticisms of the scheme were the supposed damage to the environment and an argued real lack of sufficient water for all of the affected parties (the proponents of the scheme answered back that there was no risk of a serious environmental damage and that in 2003, 14 times more water reached the sea than what was needed annually).[*citation needed*] The scheme, finally approved by the Government, was canceled by Zapatero soon after becoming Prime Minister.\n\n\nZapatero was the main proponent of the \"Pacto de las Libertades contra el Terrorismo\" (\"Anti Terrorist Freedom pact) which was signed on 8 December 2000.\n\n\nAt the end of the year, the Mad Cow disease came back into the spotlight after its outbreak in 1996. Zapatero repeatedly criticized the Government's management of the crisis arguing that it was out of control.[44] As of March 2005, the disease had caused dozens of deaths all over Europe, though none in Spain.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Association of Parliamentary Journalists awarded to Zapatero the \"Diputado Revelaci\u00f3n\" prize (something like *Most promising MP of the year*) in December 1999 for his activities as a member of the Congress of Deputies. From 1996 until 2000, his most conspicuous contributions as an MP were his vigorous opposition to the electrical protocol proposed by the government (initially negative for the important coal sector of Le\u00f3n), being the PSOE spokesman in the Commission of Public Administration[28] and probably his most important success as an MP: the passing of an amendment to the national budget of 2000 in November 1999 that increased the pensions of the non-professional soldiers who fought for the Republic during the Spanish Civil War of 1936\u20131939. They were made equal to those of the professional military. The initiative was defended by him in the name of the Parliamentary Socialist Group, proponent of the amendment.[29]\n\n\n\n### Bid for PSOE leadership[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAnother point of friction came from the scheme to transfer water from the River Ebro to other areas, especially the irrigated areas in the South East of Spain, one of the richest agricultural regions in the world. The scheme had received support from, among others, 80% of the affected farmers and the Socialist regional governments of regions such as Extremadura, Andalusia or Castilla-La Mancha.[*citation needed*] Some Socialist politicians also supported it when they were members of the former Socialist government back in the 90s (e.g. Jos\u00e9 Borrell, the current leader of the European Spanish Socialist Group and former president of the European Parliament.[43] The scheme was mainly opposed by Zapatero, environmentalist groups, the Socialist regional government of Aragon and some of the citizens of the areas from which water was to be transferred. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n10. **^** \"Zapatero, a un diario israel\u00ed: 'Antisemitismo hab\u00eda con Franco'\". *El Mundo* (in Spanish).

As an MP he was finally exempted.[14]\n\n\n\n### Entering politics[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nLater, after an audiotape in Arabic was found in a van near a railway station where the perpetrators boarded one of the trains, Aznar declared that all of the possibilities were being investigated.[64] The government was accused of manipulating information about who was responsible for the attacks to avoid the consequences of public anger at a bombing motivated by its foreign policy \u2013 Aznar personally phoned the editors of the four national daily newspapers to tell them that ETA were responsible, whilst Minister of the Interior \u00c1ngel Acebes attacked those who believed that responsibility lay elsewhere, despite not offering any evidence for ETA's culpability,[65] and the state broadcaster TVE initially failed to report the protest outside the Popular Party's headquarters which ran through the night before the day of the election.[66]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThat alliance resulted in another setback for the Socialist Party when the Spanish newspaper *ABC* published an article stating that Josep-Llu\u00eds Carod-Rovira, leader of Republican Left of Catalonia, had met some ETA members secretly in January 2004. According to *ABC*, Carod-Rovira had promised to provide ETA with political support if the group did not act in Catalonia, which seemed to have been confirmed by the ETA announcement of a truce affecting only that region some months later, before the general election of 2004. Carod-Rovira resigned as vice president of the Catalan government, but continued to be the leader of his party. The scandal damaged Zapatero's image, as ETA and political violence are controversial issues in Spain and Carod-Rovira's party was seen as a possible ally if Zapatero won the election.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBefore being elected, Zapatero opposed the American policy in regard to Iraq pursued by Prime Minister Aznar. During the electoral campaign Zapatero promised to withdraw the troops if control in Iraq was not passed to the United Nations after 30 June (the ending date of the initial Spanish military agreement with the multinational coalition that had overthrown Saddam Hussein). Zapatero declared that he did not intend to withdraw the Spanish troops before that date after being questioned about the issue by the People's Party's leader Mariano Rajoy in his inauguration parliamentary debate as Prime Minister.\n\n\nOn 19 April 2004 Zapatero announced the withdrawal of the 1,300 Spanish troops in Iraq.[98]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section of a biography of a living person **needs additional citations for verification**.

Zapatero's supporters blame his opponents for that and the People's Party blames him stating facts such as the increase in the acts of violence committed against them, especially in the months before and during the war in Iraq.[39] As a result, a new term has become popular: *guerracivilismo*[40] (made up of a combination of the Spanish for Civil War and the *-ismo* suffix, equivalent to the English \"-ism\"), which would refer to the growing enmity of right and left-wing factions.\n\n\nZapatero's criticisms of the government were very active from the beginning, blaming the government for its inability to control the rise in the price of fossil fuel and asking for a reduction in the corresponding taxes.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter a major demonstration took place against this education reform, the government held a series of meetings with many of the organizations that opposed the reform, reaching agreements with some of them (especially parents' associations and teachers' unions). Some others, most prominently the People's Party and the Catholic Church remain staunchly opposed to it.\n\n\n\n### ETA[edit]\n\n\nMain article: ETA's 2006 ceasefire declaration\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nZapatero's team had entered into contact with Jos\u00e9 Luis Balb\u00e1s through Enrique Mart\u00ednez and Jes\u00fas Caldera (then Minister of Labor)[56] In April 2000, Zapatero, Caldera and Jos\u00e9 Blanco had had lunch with Eduardo Tamayo in a restaurant in Madrid. Tamayo would later become a representative of Zapatero in the 35th party national conference. At the end of the month \"Renovadores de la Base\" (the faction of Tamayo and Balb\u00e1s) decided to support Zapatero and the later agreed to be part of Zapatero's team.[57] He played an important role during Zapatero's promotion. For example, Balb\u00e1s together with Jos\u00e9 Blanco controlled the list of delegates.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nZapatero publicly stated his support for John Kerry as a candidate running in the U.S. Presidential election in 2004.[102] After the election took place, winner George W. Bush did not return Zapatero's congratulation phone call, though the White House firmly denied that Bush's intention was to snub the Spanish prime minister.[103] Meanwhile, Zapatero repeatedly insisted that Spain's relations with the United States were good. In spite of that, Zapatero acknowledged years after that the phone conversation held with President George W. Bush was \"unforgettable\" and that when told that the Spanish troops were leaving Iraq, the American president had told him \"I am very disappointed in you\" and that the conversation ended in a \"very cold\" manner.[104]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nZapatero did not accept the account of the Socialist AMs and tried to explain it as a conspiratorial plot caused by speculative interests of the house building industry that would have bribed the AMs to prevent a left-wing government.[*citation needed*] The People's Party, on the other hand, defended the theory that the anger of the two Socialist AMs was caused by Zapatero's broken promise about the referred distribution of power within the Madrid section of the Socialist Party. That promise would have been made some months before the crisis in exchange of support for one of his more immediate collaborators (Trinidad Jim\u00e9nez), who wanted to become the Socialist candidate for mayor of Madrid (the Spanish capital).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs a result, after being appointed Secretary General, he coined the term *Calm Opposition* (*Oposici\u00f3n Tranquila*) to refer to his opposition strategy. The *Calm Opposition* was supposedly based on an \"open to dialogue\", \"soft\", \"constructive\" attitude (*talante constructivo*, coined as *talante*) aimed not at damaging the government but at achieving the \"best\" for the people. (Zapatero has insisted on this point so many times that the term *talante* has become very popular in Spain.) Because of this supposed tactic, Zapatero received nicknames like *Bambi* or *Sosoman* (where *Soso*, meaning \"dull, insipid, bore\", replaces *Super* in *Superman*), especially in the first months after being appointed General Secretary.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHe eventually joined the PSOE on 23 February 1979. The impression Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez had caused on him in 1976 played a fundamental role in his decision to join the party. In 1979, during the Congreso Extraordinario del PSOE (1979), the PSOE had renounced Marxism as its ideological base. He said nothing about joining the party at home, because he was afraid his parents would discourage him, considering him too young to join a political party.\n\n\nIn 1982, Zapatero became head of the socialist youth organization in the province of Le\u00f3n. In July 1982, he met Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez at the summer school \"Jaime Vera\" and suggested that he make a \"left turn\" in the PSOE political program for the General Election of October 1982.[18] Gonz\u00e1lez answered advising him to abandon his conservative (traditional for PSOE [leftist]) viewpoint.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Member of the Congress of Deputies[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This biography of a living person **needs additional citations for verification**.

His performance as a student was above average before his pre-University year. According to his brother Juan: \"He didn't study much but it made no difference, he continued successfully\".[12]\n\n\nAfter graduating, Zapatero worked as a teaching assistant in constitutional law at the University of Le\u00f3n until 1986 (he continued working some hours a week without pay until 1991). It was subsequently found that he had been appointed by his department without the usual selection process involving interviews and competitive examinations, which if true, constitutes a case of political favouritism.[4] He has declared that the only activity that attracts him besides politics is teaching or, at most, academic research.[13]\n\n\nRodr\u00edguez Zapatero met Sonsoles Espinosa in Le\u00f3n in 1981. They married on 27 January 1990 and have two daughters named Laura (b. 1993) and Alba (b. 1995).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nZapatero himself has repeatedly accused the Popular Party of lying about those who were responsible for the attacks. On the other hand, the book *11-M. La venganza* by Casimiro Abadillo, a Spanish journalist who works for the newspaper *El Mundo*, claims that, before the General Election, Zapatero had told that newspaper's director, Pedro J. Ramirez, that two suicide bombers had been found among the victims (although the specialists that examined the bodies said they found no such evidence).[67] When he was asked in December 2004 about the issue by the Parliamentary Investigative Committee created to find the truth about the attacks, he declared that he did not remember what he had said.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter his election to the leadership of the PSOE, Zapatero spoke about the influence of the political philosophy of civic republicanism on him in general, and in particular the ideas of republican political philosopher Philip Pettit. In an interview with *El Mundo*, Zapatero linked civic republicanism's focus on civic virtue to tolerance of individual autonomy and expanding political participation.[38]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe People's Party government and Zapatero (who accused ETA in a radio statement broadcast at 8:50\u00a0am), initially claimed the attacks to be the work of ETA, an armed Basque nationalist separatist organization. \n</fragment>\n</document>",

He served twice as Prime Minister of Italy, first from 18 May 1996 to 21 October 1998, and then from 17 May 2006 to 8 May 2008.[1][2] Prodi is considered the founder of the Italian centre-left and one of the most prominent and iconic figures of the Second Republic. He is often nicknamed *Il Professore* (\"The Professor\") due to his academic career.[3]\n\n\nA former professor of economics and international advisor to Goldman Sachs, Prodi ran as lead candidate of The Olive Tree coalition, winning the 1996 Italian general election and serving as Prime Minister until 1998. Following the victory of his coalition The Union over the House of Freedoms led by Silvio Berlusconi in the 2006 Italian general election, Prodi took power again. On 24 January 2008, he lost a vote of confidence in the Senate and consequently tendered his resignation as Prime Minister to President Giorgio Napolitano; he continued in office for almost four months for routine business until early elections were held and a new government was formed. Prodi has been the first left-leaning candidate to ever come first at legislative elections since the 1921 Italian general election and to manage to form a government without the need of opponents' parliamentary support.\n\n\nOn 14 October 2007, Prodi became the first president of the Democratic Party upon foundation of the party. On 12 September 2008, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon selected Prodi as president of the African Union\u2013United Nations peacekeeping panel.[4] Since 2021, he is serving as the United Nations Special Envoy for the Sahel.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and family[edit]\n\n\nProdi was born in Scandiano, near Reggio Emilia, in 1939; he is the eighth of nine children. His father, Mario Prodi, was an engineer grown up in a peasant family, and his mother, Enrichetta, was an elementary school teacher. Most of the brothers are, or have been, university professors, among them Giovanni Prodi (professor of mathematical analysis), Vittorio Prodi (professor of physics and member of the European Parliament), Paolo Prodi (professor of modern history), Franco Prodi\u00a0[it] (professor of atmospheric physics), and Giorgio Prodi (professor of general pathology).[5]\n\n\nIn 1969, Prodi married Flavia Franzoni, at that time a student, who later became an economist and university professor. The couple was married by Camillo Ruini, now a well-known cardinal.[6][7] They have two sons, Giorgio and Antonio. His wife Flavia died on 13 June 2023, at the age of 76.[8]\n\n\n\n## Academic career[edit]\n\n\nAfter completing his secondary education at the *Liceo Ludovico Ariosto* in Reggio Emilia, Prodi graduated in law at Milan's Universit\u00e0 Cattolica in 1961 with a thesis on the role of protectionism in the development of Italian industry. He then carried out postgraduate studies at the London School of Economics.[9]\n\n\nProdi has received almost 20 honorary degrees from institutions in Italy, and from the rest of Europe, North America, Asia, and Africa.[10]\n\n\n\n## Early political career[edit]\n\n\n### Ministry of Industry and Aldo Moro's kidnapping[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Prodi with Sandro Pertini and Giulio Andreotti in 1978\nOn 25 November 1978, Prodi was appointed Minister of Industry, Commerce, and Crafts in the government of the Christian Democracy leader Giulio Andreotti. Even if he was a party member, Prodi was widely considered a technical minister. As minister, he promoted a law, known as Prodi law, which aimed a regulating of the extraordinary state administration procedure for the rescue of large enterprises in crisis.[11]\n\n\nOn 2 April 1978, Prodi and other teachers at the University of Bologna passed on a tip-off that revealed the whereabouts of the safe house where the kidnapped Aldo Moro, the former Prime Minister, was being held captive by the Red Brigades. Prodi stated that he had been given this tip-off by the founders of Christian Democracy, contacted from beyond the grave via a s\u00e9ance and a Ouija board. Whilst during this supposed s\u00e9ance Prodi thought *Gradoli* referred to a town on the outskirts of Rome, it probably referred to the Roman address of a Red Brigades safe house, located at no. 96, Via Gradoli.[12]\n\n\nThe information was trusted and a police group made an armed blitz in the town of Gradoli, 80\u00a0km from Rome, on the following day, 6 April,[12] although Moro was not found. The supernatural element was generally not overlooked during the investigations. For example, the Italian government had engaged a diviner, hoping that he would find Moro's location.[13] The police made another fruitless blitz in Viterbo after an abbess declared that, during a vision, she had seen him there.[14]\n\n\nProdi spoke to the Italian Parliament's commission about the case in 1981. In the notes of the Italian Parliament commission on terrorism, the s\u00e9ance is described as a fake, used to hide the true source of the information.[15] In 1997, Andreotti declared that the information came from the Bologna section of Autonomia Operaia, a far-left organization with some ties with the Red Brigades, and that Francesco Cossiga also knew the true source. Judge Ferdinando Imposimato considered Andreotti's theory as possible but accused him of having kept information that could have been valuable in a trial about Moro's murder.[16] Moro's widow later declared that she had repeatedly informed the police that a via Gradoli existed in Rome, but the investigators did not consider it; some replied to her that the street did not appear in Rome's maps. This is confirmed by other Moro relatives but strongly denied by Cossiga, who served as Interior Minister during Moro's kidnapping.[17]\n\n\n\n### Mitrokhin Commission[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1990s, the s\u00e9ance matter was reopened by the Italian Parliament's commission on terrorism. While Prodi (then Prime Minister) declared that he had no time for an interview, both Mario Baldassarri (senator and vice-minister in two Silvio Berlusconi cabinets) and Alberto Cl\u00f2 (Minister of Industry in Lamberto Dini's cabinet and owner of the house where the s\u00e9ance was performed) responded to the call; they confirmed the circumstances of the s\u00e9ance, and that *Gradoli* had appeared in several sessions, even if the participants had changed.[18] Later, other Italian members of the European Commission alleged that Prodi had invented this story to conceal the real source of the tip-off, which they believed to have originated somewhere among the far-left Italian political groups.[18]\n\n\nThis issue came back again in 2005, when Prodi was accused of being \"a KGB man\" by Mario Scaramella.[19] The allegations were rejected by Prodi. Former Federal Security Service (FSB) officer Alexander Litvinenko also said that FSB deputy chief Anatoly Trofimov \"did not exactly say that Prodi was a KGB agent, because the KGB avoids using that word.\"[20] The same accusation was raised in 2002 by the Mitrokhin Commission, which was closed in 2006 with a majority and a minority report, without reaching shared conclusions, and without any concrete evidence given to support the original allegations of KGB ties to Italian politicians contained in the Mitrokhin Archive. Led by the centre-right coalition majority, it was criticized as politically motivated, as it was focused mainly on allegations against opposition figures.[21] 2006 saw the publication of telephone interceptions between the chairman of the Mitrokhin Commission, Forza Italia senator Paolo Guzzanti, and Scaramella. In the wiretaps, Guzzanti made it clear that the true intent of the Mitrokhin Commission was to support the hypothesis that Prodi would have been an agent financed or in any case manipulated by Moscow and the KGB.[22][23] According to the opposition, which submitted its own minority report, this hypothesis was false, and the purpose of the commission was therefore to discredit him.[24] In the wiretaps, Scaramella had the task of collecting testimonies from some ex-agents of the Soviet secret service refugees in Europe to support these accusations; he was later charged for calumny.[25]\n\n\nIn November 2006, the new Italian Parliament with a centre-left coalition majority instituted a commission to investigate the Mitrokhin Commission for allegations that it was manipulated for political purposes.[26] In a December 2006 interview given to the television program *La storia siamo noi*,[27] colonel ex-KGB agent Oleg Gordievsky, whom Scaramella claimed as his source, confirmed the accusations made against Scaramella regarding the production of false material relating to Prodi and other Italian politicians,[28] and underlined their lack of reliability.[29] Despite this, those claims were further repeated by the UK Independence Party's Gerard Batten, the member of the European Parliament for London who stated that he was informed of this by Litvinenko, who was his constituent and former FSB operative. The 16 February 2018 indictment of Paul Manafort unsealed on 23 February,[30] as part of the Mueller special counsel investigation, alleges that foreign politicians hypothesized to be Prodi and Alfred Gusenbauer took payments exceeding $2 million from Manafort to promote the case of his client, Viktor Yanukovich; both denied this and said their work was focused to get closer European Union\u2013Ukraine relations.[31][32]\n\n\n\n## Business and administrative career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Prodi with Minister Luigi Granelli in 1985\nAfter leaving his position in 1989, Prodi ran the Bologna based consulting company *Analisi e Studi Economici*, which he jointly owned along with his wife.[33] Between 1990 and 1993 the company earned \u00a31.4 million, most of which was paid by the investment bank Goldman Sachs.[33]\n\n\n\n### Second term as IRI President[edit]\n\n\nIn 1993, Prodi was between the main candidates to become Prime Minister of Italy at the head of a technocratic government; instead, the Governor of the Bank of Italy, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, was chosen for this office by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro.[34]\n\n\nIn 1993\u20131994, Prodi was appointed again President of the IRI, by Ciampi, where he oversaw extensive privatization of public assets. For his activities in this period Prodi would later twice come under investigation \u2013 firstly for an alleged conflict of interest in relation to contracts awarded to his own economic research company in relation to the Italdel-Siemens merger, and secondly concerning the sale of the loss-making state-owned food conglomerate SME to the multinational Unilever, for which he had previously been a paid consultant.[33]\n\n\nProdi's former employer Goldman Sachs was involved in both of the deals.[33] In February 2007 the Italian Treasury Police raided the Milan office of Goldman Sachs, where they removed a file called \"MTononi/memo-Prodi02.doc\".[33] They also obtained a letter to Siemens from the Frankfurt office of Goldman Sachs regarding the Italdel deal, which revealed that Prodi was made the Senior Advisor of Goldman Sachs International in Italy in March 1990.[33] In November 1996, after Prodi had been elected Prime Minister, Rome prosecutor Guiseppa Geremia concluded that there was enough evidence to press charges against Prodi for conflict of interest in the Unilever deal. The case was however shut down within weeks by superiors, while Geremia was \"exiled to Sardinia\".[33]\n\n\n\n## First term as Prime Minister (1996\u20131998)[edit]\n\n\nOn 25 May 1994, Prodi went to Palazzo Chigi to announce his resignation as IRI President to the new Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi;[35] the resignation had been formalised on 31 May and became effective on 22 July.[36]\n\n\nOn 11 August, Prodi announced to the *Gazzetta di Reggio* of his intent to enter politics.[37] A few months earlier, Prodi had rejected a proposal from the Italian People's Party (PPI) to run for the 1994 European election.[38]\n\n\n\n### The Olive Tree and 1996 election[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 1996 Italian general election, The Olive Tree (Italy), and Prodi I Cabinet\n\n![](image)Prodi during the electoral campaign in 1996\nOn 13 February 1995 Prodi, along with his close friend Arturo Parisi, founded his political alliance The Olive Tree.[39] Prodi's aim was to build a centre-left coalition composed by centrist and leftist parties, opposed to the centre-right alliance led by Silvio Berlusconi, who resigned from the office of Prime Minister few weeks before, when Lega Nord withdrew his support to the government. The movement was immediately supported by Mariotto Segni, leader of the centrist Segni Pact; after few weeks the post-communist Democratic Party of the Left of Massimo D'Alema, the PPI and the Federation of the Greens also joined the Olive Tree coalition.\n\n\nOn 19 February 1996, the outgoing Prime Minister Lamberto Dini announced that he would run in the election with a new party called Italian Renewal, allied with Prodi's Olive Tree rather than Berlusconi's Pole for Freedoms. Shortly after Berlusconi claimed that Dini \"copied his electoral programme\".[40]\n\n\nOn election day, Prodi's Olive Tree coalition won over Berlusconi's Pole for Freedoms, becoming the first coalition composed of a post-communist party to win a general election since the Second World War. In the Senate, The Olive Tree obtained the majority; in the Chamber, it required the external support of Communist Refoundation Party. On 17 May 1996, Prodi received from President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro the task of forming a new government.[41] He ultimately formed a 23-member cabinet that included 16 PDS ministers (including Deputy Prime Minister Walter Veltroni) and 10 PDS junior ministers\u2013the first (former) Communists to take part in government in half a century.\n\n\n\n### Policies[edit]\n\n\nProdi's economic programme consisted in continuing the past governments' work of restoration of the country's economic health, in order to pursue the then seemingly unreachable goal of leading the country within the strict European Monetary System parameters in order to allow the country to join the Euro currency. He succeeded in this in little more than six months.\n\n\nDuring his first premiership, Prodi faced the Albanian civil war; his government proposed the so-called Operation Alba (\"Sunrise\"), a multinational peacekeeping force sent to Albania in 1997 and led by Italy. It was intended to help the Albanian government restore law and order in their troubled country after the 1997 rebellion in Albania.[42]\n\n\n\n![](image)Prodi with United States Secretary of Defence William Cohen\nFollowing the degenerating loss of administrative control by the Government in the first days of March 1997, culminating in the desertion of most Police and many Republican Guard and Army units, leaving their armouries open to the inevitable looting which soon followed, several Nations autonomously helped evacuate their Nationals in Operation Silver Wake and Operation Libelle.\n\n\nThe UN Security Council therefore agreed the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1101 as a stop-gap operation to manage this and buy time, laying the foundations for a planned reconstruction, which after six weeks of debate fell to the Western European Union, creating the Multinational Albanian Police Element around a command structure of Italian Carabinieri, which actually undertook the work of Judicial and Police reconstruction, extending into the elimination of the economic causes of the crisis.\n\n\nThe Italian 3rd Army Corps assumed responsibility for the stop-gap mission as Operation Alba, the first multinational Italian-led Mission since World War II. Eleven contributing European Nations[43] brought humanitarian aid to a country that was in a dramatic economic and political situation.[44] In 1997, Prodi declared that \"the problem of the safety of the country seems to be no longer one of external safety, but an internal one: the safety of citizens in their everyday life\".[45]\n\n\n\n### Resignation[edit]\n\n\nProdi's government fell in 1998 when the Communist Refoundation Party withdrew its external support. This led to the formation of a new government led by Massimo D'Alema as Prime Minister. There are those who claim that D'Alema, along with People's Party leader Franco Marini, deliberately engineered the collapse of the Prodi government to become Prime Minister himself.[46] As the result of a vote of no confidence in Prodi's government, D'Alema's nomination was passed by a single vote. This was the first occasion in the history of the Italian Republic on which a vote of no confidence had ever been called; the Republic's many previous governments had been brought down by a majority \"no\" vote on some crucially important piece of legislation (such as the budget).\n\n\n\n## President of the European Commission (1999\u20132004)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Prodi Commission\n\n![](image)Official portrait of Prodi as President of the European Commission, 1999\nIn September 1999 Prodi, a strong supporter of European Integration, became President of the European Commission, thanks to the support of both the conservative European People's Party, the social-democratic Party of European Socialists and the centrist Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party in the European Parliament.\n\n\nHis commission took office on 13 September 1999 following the scandal and subsequent resignation of the Santer Commission which had damaged the reputation of the institution. It took over from the interim Mar\u00edn Commission. The College consisted of 20 Commissioners which grew to 30 following the Enlargement of the European Union in 2004. It was the last commission to see two members allocated to the larger member states. This commission (the 10th) saw in increase in power and influence following Amsterdam Treaty. Some in the media described president Prodi as being the first \"Prime Minister of the European Union\".\n\n\n\n### Amsterdam Treaty[edit]\n\n\nIt was during Prodi's presidency, in 2002, that 11 EU member states ditched their national currencies and adopted the euro as their common currency. This commission (the 10th) saw an increase in power and influence following the Amsterdam Treaty.\n\n\nThe treaty was the result of long negotiations which began in Messina, Sicily, on 2 June 1995, nearly forty years after the signing of the Treaty of Rome, and reached completion in Amsterdam on 18 June 1997. Following the formal signing of the Treaty on 2 October 1997, the member states engaged in an equally long and complex ratification process. The European Parliament endorsed the treaty on 19 November 1997, and after two referendums and 13 decisions by parliaments, the member states finally concluded the procedure. Under this treaty the member states agreed to devolve certain powers from national governments to the European Parliament across diverse areas, including legislating on immigration, adopting civil and criminal laws, and enacting foreign and security policy (CFSP), as well as implementing institutional changes for expansion as new member nations join the EU.\n\n\nDue to this increased power of the Commission President, some media described President Prodi as being the first \"Prime Minister of the European Union\".[47][48]\n\n\n\n### Nice Treaty[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Prodi with Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2000\nAs well as the enlargement and Amsterdam Treaty, the Prodi Commission also saw the signing and enforcement of the Treaty of Nice as well as the conclusion and signing of the European Constitution: in which he introduced the \"Convention method\" of negotiation. The treaty was signed by European leaders on 26 February 2001 and came into force on 1 February 2003.\n\n\nIt amended the Maastricht Treaty (or the Treaty on European Union) and the Treaty of Rome (or the Treaty establishing the European Community which, before the Maastricht Treaty, was the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community). The Treaty of Nice reformed the institutional structure of the European Union to withstand eastward expansion, a task which was originally intended to have been done by the Amsterdam Treaty, but failed to be addressed at the time. The entry into force of the treaty was in doubt for a time, after its initial rejection by Irish voters in a referendum in June 2001. This referendum result was reversed in a subsequent referendum held a little over a year later.\n\n\n\n### 2004 enlargement and end of the mandate[edit]\n\n\nIn 2004, his last year as Commission President, the European Union was enlarged to admit several more member nations, most formerly part of the Soviet bloc. It was the largest single expansion of the European Union (EU), in terms of territory, number of states, and population to date; however, it was not the largest in terms of gross domestic product. It occurred on 1 May 2004.\n\n\nThe simultaneous accessions concerned the following countries (sometimes referred to as the \"A10\" countries[49][50]): Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia. Seven of these were part of the former Eastern Bloc (of which three were from the former Soviet Union and four were and still are members of the Central European alliance Visegr\u00e1d Group), one of the former Yugoslavia (together sometimes referred to as the \"A8\" countries), and the remaining two were Mediterranean islands and former British colonies.\n\n\nPart of the same wave was the 2007 enlargement of the European Union that saw accession of Bulgaria and Romania, who were unable to join in 2004, but, according to the Commission, constitute part of the fifth enlargement. The commission was due to leave office on 31 October 2004, but due to opposition from the European parliament to the proposed Barroso Commission which would succeed it, it was extended and finally left office on 21 November 2004. When his mandate expired, Prodi returned to domestic politics.\n\n\n\n## Return to Italian politics (2005\u20132006)[edit]\n\n\n### The Union primary election[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2005 Italian centre-left primary election\n\nShortly before the end of his term as President of the European Commission, Prodi returned to national Italian politics at the helm of the enlarged centre-left coalition, The Union.\n\n\n\n![](image)Prodi in Bari during the electoral campaign\nHaving no party of his own, in order to officially state his candidacy for the 2006 general election, Prodi came up with the idea of an apposite primary election, the first of such kind to be ever introduced in Europe and seen by its creator (Prodi himself) as a democratic move to bring the public and its opinion closer to the Italian politics.\n\n\nWhen the primary elections were first proposed, they were mostly meant as a plebiscite for Romano Prodi, since there were no other candidates for the leadership of the coalition. The secretary of the Communist Refoundation Party, Fausto Bertinotti, then announced he would run for the leadership, even if only to act as a symbolic candidate, to avoid a one-candidate election. After some time, more candidates were presented, like Union of Democrats for Europe leader Clemente Mastella, Italy of Values leader and former magistrate Antonio Di Pietro, Federation of the Greens leader Alfonso Pecoraro Scanio and others few minor candidates.[51]\n\n\nThe primary election may have been foreseen an easy win for Romano Prodi, with the other candidates running mostly to \"measure their strengths\" in the coalition, and they often talked about reaching a certain percentage rather than winning. However, there were rumours of supporters of the House of Freedoms trying to participate in the elections, and vote in favour of Mastella, reputed to be the least competent of the candidates and the least likely to win against Berlusconi, other than the most centrist; other rumours indicated such \"fake\" left-wing voters would vote for Bertinotti, because his leadership would likely lose any grip on the political centre.[52]\n\n\nThe election had been held nationwide on 16 October 2005, from 8 am to 10 pm. Poll stations were mainly managed on a voluntary basis; they were hosted mainly in squares, local party quarters, schools, and even restaurants, bars, campers and a hairdresser; some polling stations were also provided outside the country for Italians abroad. Most of the party leaders claimed a result of 1 million voters would be a good success for the election, but over four million people for the occasion went to cast a vote in the primary election.[53]\n\n\n\n## Second term as Prime Minister (2006\u20132008)[edit]\n\n\n### Italian 2006 general election[edit]\n\n\nAfter having won the centre-left primary election, Prodi led The Union coalition in the 2006 election. The Union was a heterogeneous alliance, which was formed by centrist parties like UDEUR and communists like PRC and Party of Italian Communists.\n\n\nProdi led his coalition to the electoral campaign preceding the election, eventually on 9 and 10 April won by a very narrow margin of 25,000 votes, and a final majority of two seats in the Senate. Initial exit polls suggested a victory for Prodi, but the results narrowed as the count progressed. On 11 April 2006, Prodi declared victory;[54] Berlusconi never conceded defeat explicitly but this is not required by the Italian law.\n\n\nPreliminary results showed The Union leading the House of Freedoms in the Chamber of Deputies, with 340 seats to 277, thanks to obtaining a majority bonus (actual votes were distributed 49.81% to 49.74%). One more seat is allied with The Union (Aosta Valley) and 7 more seats in the foreign constituency. The House of Freedoms had secured a slight majority of Senate seats elected within Italy (155 seats to 154), but The Union won 4 of the 6 seats allocated to voters outside Italy, giving them control of both chambers.[55]\n\n\nOn 19 April 2006, Italy's Supreme Court of Cassation ruled that Prodi had indeed won the election, winning control of the Chamber of Deputies by only 24,755 votes out of more than 38 million votes cast, and winning 158 seats in the Senate to 156 for Berlusconi's coalition. Even so, Berlusconi refused to concede defeat, claiming unproven fraud.\n\n\n\n### Government formation[edit]\n\n\nProdi's appointment was somewhat delayed, as the outgoing President of the Republic, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, ended his mandate in May, not having enough time for the usual procedure (consultations made by the President, appointment of a Prime Minister, the motion of confidence and oath of office). After the acrimonious election of Giorgio Napolitano to replace Ciampi, Prodi could proceed with his transition to government. On 16 May he was invited by Napolitano to form a government. The following day, 17 May 2006, Prodi and his second cabinet were sworn into office.\n\n\nProdi's new cabinet drew in politicians from across his centre-left winning coalition, in addition to Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, an unelected former official of the European Central Bank with no partisan membership. Romano Prodi obtained the support for his cabinet on 19 May at the Senate and on 23 May at the Chamber of Deputies.\n\n\nThe coalition led by Prodi, thanks to the electoral law which gave the winner a sixty-seat majority, can count on a good majority in the Chamber of Deputies but only on a very narrow majority in the Senate. The composition of the coalition was heterogeneous, combining parties of communist ideology, the Party of Italian Communists and Communist Refoundation Party, within the same government as parties of Catholic inspiration, Democracy is Freedom \u2013 The Daisy and UDEUR. The latter was led by Clemente Mastella, former chairman of Christian Democracy. Therefore, according to critics,[*by whom?*] it was difficult to have a single policy in different key areas, such as economics and foreign politics (for instance, Italian military presence in Afghanistan).\n\n\n\n### Foreign policy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Prodi at the Helligendamm G8 Summit, June 2007\nIn foreign policy, the Prodi II Cabinet continued the engagement in Afghanistan, under UN command, while withdrawing troops from post-invasion Iraq on 18 May 2006, when Prodi laid out some sense of his new foreign policy, pledging to withdraw Italian troops from Iraq and called the Iraq War a \"grave mistake that has not solved but increased the problem of security\".[56]\n\n\nThe major effort of foreign minister Massimo D'Alema concerned the aftermath of the 2006 Lebanon War, being the first to offer troops to the UN for the constitution of the UNIFIL force, and assuming its command in February 2007. In fact, Prodi had a key role in the creation of a multinational peacekeeping force in Lebanon following the Israel-Lebanon conflict.\n\n\nItaly led negotiations with the Israeli foreign minister Tzipi Livni and was proposed by Israel to head the multinational peacekeeping mission, although the dangers of the mission for Italian troops sparked warnings from the center-right opposition that it could prove a \"kamikaze\" mission, with the peacekeepers sandwiched between Israel and the well-armed Hezbollah.[57] Prodi and D'Alema pledged Italy's willingness to enforce the United Nations resolution on Lebanon and urged other European Union member states to do the same because the stability of the Middle East should be a chief concern for Europeans.[58]\n\n\n\n### Coalition's troubles[edit]\n\n\nProdi's government faced a crisis over policies in early 2007, after just nine months of government. Three ministers in Prodi's Cabinet boycotted a vote in January to continue funding for Italian troop deployments in Afghanistan. Lawmakers approved the expansion of the US military base Caserma Ederle at the end of January, but the victory was so narrow that Deputy Prime Minister Francesco Rutelli criticised members of the coalition who had not supported the government. At around the same time, Justice Minister Clemente Mastella, of the coalition member UDEUR, said he would rather see the government fall than support its unwed couples legislation.[59]\n\n\nTens of thousands of people marched in Vicenza against the expansion of Caserma Ederle, which saw the participation of some leading far-left members of the government.[60] Harsh debates followed in the Italian Senate on 20 February 2007. Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Affairs Minister Massimo D'Alema declared during an official visit in Ibiza, Spain that, without a majority on foreign policy affairs, the government would resign. The following day, D'Alema gave a speech at the Senate representing the government, clarifying his foreign policy and asking the Senate to vote for or against it. In spite of the fear of many senators that Prodi's defeat would return Silvio Berlusconi to power, the Senate did not approve a motion backing Prodi's government foreign policy, two votes shy of the required majority of 160.[61]\n\n\n\n![](image)Prodi with President Giorgio Napolitano\nAfter a Government meeting on 21 February, Romano Prodi tendered his resignation to the President Giorgio Napolitano, who cut short an official visit to Bologna in order to receive the Prime Minister. Prodi's spokesman indicated that he would only agree to form a new Government \"if, and only if, he is guaranteed the full support of all the parties in the majority from now on.\"[62] On 22 February, centre-left coalition party leaders backed a non-negotiable list of twelve political conditions given by Prodi as conditions of his remaining in office. President Napolitano held talks with political leaders on 23 February to decide whether to confirm Prodi's Government, ask Prodi to form a new government or call fresh elections.[63]\n\n\nFollowing these talks, on 24 February, President Napolitano asked Prodi to remain in office but to submit to a vote of confidence in both houses.[63][64] On 28 February, the Senate voted to grant confidence to Prodi's Government. Though facing strong opposition from the centre-right coalition, the vote resulted in a 162\u2013157 victory. Prodi then faced a vote of confidence in the lower house on 2 March, which he won as expected with a large majority of 342\u2013198.[65]\n\n\nOn 14 October 2007, Prodi oversaw the merger of two main parties of the Italian centre-left, Democrats of the Left and Democracy is Freedom \u2013 The Daisy, creating the Democratic Party. Prodi himself led the merger of the two parties, which had been planned over a twelve-year period, and became the first President of the party. He announced his resignation from that post on 16 April 2008, two days after the Democratic Party's defeat in the general election.\n\n\n\n### 2008 crisis and resignation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2008 Italian political crisis\n\nIn early January 2008, Justice Minister and Union of Democrats for Europe's leader Clemente Mastella resigned after his wife Sandra Lonardo was put under house arrest for corruption charges. With three Senators, UDEUR was instrumental to ensure a narrow centre-left majority in the Italian Senate.[66]\n\n\nAfter first promising to support the government, he later retracted this support, and his party followed, in part also due to pressure from the Vatican, for which the government's proposed laws in regards to registered partnerships of same-sex couples, and other liberal reforms were objectionable.[67] Mastella also cited lack of solidarity from the majority parties after the arrest of his wife, and declared that his party would vote against the government bills since then.\n\n\nThe decision of former Minister of Justice Mastella arrived a few days after the confirmation of the Constitutional Court which confirmed the referendum to modify the electoral system.[68] As stated many times by Minister Mastella, if the referendum had been confirmed, it would lead directly to the fall of the government[69][70]\nand it happened.  \n The fall of the government would disrupt a pending election-law referendum that if passed would make it harder for small parties like Mastella's to gain seats in parliament.[71]\n\n\nThe UDEUR defection forced caused Prodi to ask for a confidence vote in both Chambers: he won a clear majority in the Chamber of Deputies on 23 January,[72] but was defeated 156 to 161 (with 1 abstention)[73] in the Senate the next day. He therefore tendered his resignation as Prime Minister to President Giorgio Napolitano, who accepted it and appointed the President of the Senate, Franco Marini, with the task of evaluating possibilities for forming interim government to implement electoral reforms prior to holding elections. Marini, after consultation with all major political forces, acknowledged the impossibility of doing so on 5 February, forcing Napolitano to announce the end of the legislature.[74] Prodi said that he would not seek to lead a new government and snap election were called.[75] In the election that followed in April 2008, Berlusconi's centre-right The People of Freedom and allies defeated the Democratic Party.[76]\n\n\n\n## After the premiership (2008\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Prodi in 2010\nOn 19 March 2008, during the political campaign for the snap general election, Romano Prodi stated \"I called it a day with Italian politics and maybe with politics in general.\"[77]\n\n\nOn 12 September 2008, Prodi was named by the UN as head of a joint AU-UN panel aimed at enhancing peacekeeping operations in Africa.[78]\n\n\nOn 6 February 2009, he was appointed Professor-at-Large at the Watson Institute for International Studies of Brown University.[79] Since 2010 Romano Prodi is the chair for Sino-European dialogue at the China Europe International Business School (CEIBS \u2013 Shanghai&Beijing), China's leading business school.\n\n\nOn 9 October 2012, Romano Prodi was appointed by the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon as his Special Envoy for the Sahel. He served in that position until 31 January 2014.[80]\n\n\nProdi is also a member of the Club de Madrid, an international organization of former democratic statesmen, which works to strengthen democratic governance and leadership.[81] He is a former member of the Steering Committee of the Bilderberg Group.[82]\n\n\n\n### 2013 presidential candidate[edit]\n\n\nProdi was drafted by Democratic Party parliamentarians to be President of Italy during the 2013 presidential election after Democratic Party\u2013People of Freedom compromise candidate Franco Marini failed to receive sufficient votes on the first ballot.[*citation needed*] During the first three rounds of voting, few people cast ballots for Prodi (14 on the first ballot, 13 on the second and 22 on the third).[*citation needed*]\n\n\nOn 16 April 2013, just a few days prior to the fourth ballot, Prodi gave a *lectio magistralis* at the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas, *Angelicum* entitled \"I grandi cambiamenti della politica e dell'economia mondiale: c'\u00e8 un posto per l'Europa?\" (\"The Great Changes in Politics and the World Economy: Is there Room for Europe?). Prodi was sponsored by the *Angelicum* and the Universit\u00e0 degli Studi Guglielmo Marconi[83] on behalf of the Political Science program \"Scienze Politiche e del Buon Governo.\"[84]\n\n\nA few days later on 19 April, starting on the fourth ballot Prodi was looked at seriously as a possible candidate. However, Prodi announced he was pulling out of the race for President after more than 100 centre-left electors did not vote for him as he received only 395 (of 504 votes needed to be elected). After this vote, Pier Luigi Bersani, leader of centre-left Democratic Party, announced his resignation as party's secretary.[85] As of September 2020, he is a member of the Italian Aspen Institute.[86]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Election\n | House\n | Constituency\n | Party\n | Votes\n | Result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1996 | Chamber of Deputies | Bologna\u2013Mazzini |  | Ulivo | 55,830\n | ![check](image)Y **Elected** |\n| 2006 | Chamber of Deputies | Emilia-Romagna |  | Ulivo | \u2013[a] | ![check](image)Y **Elected** |\n\n\n1. **^** Elected in a closed list proportional representation system.\n\n### First-past-the-post elections[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 1996 general election (C): Bologna \u2014 Mazzini |\n| --- |\n| Candidate\n | Party\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n|  | **Romano Prodi** | The Olive Tree | 55,830\n | 60.8\n |\n|  | Filippo Berselli\n | Pole for Freedoms | 35,972\n | 39.2\n |\n| **Total** | **91,802** | **100.0** |\n\n\n## Honours and awards[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)\u00a0Albania: Received a copy of the Key of the City of Tirana on the occasion of his state visit to Albania.[87]\n* ![](image)\u00a0France: Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour (2013)[88]\n* ![](image)\u00a0Italy: Knight of Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic (2 June 1993)[89]\n* ![](image)\u00a0Japan: Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun (2012)[90]\n* ![](image)\u00a0KSA: Grand Cordon of the Order of Abdulaziz Al Saud (2007)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Latvia: First Class of the Order of the Three Stars (2007)[91]\n* ![](image)\u00a0Poland: Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland (1997)[91]\n* ![](image)\u00a0Romania: Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Star of Romania (2000)[91]\n* ![](image)\u00a0Slovakia: Grand Cordon of the Order of the White Double Cross (2022)[92]\n* ![](image)\u00a0Slovenia: First Class of the Order for Exceptional Merits (2005)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Spain: The Most Excellent Sir Grand Cross of the Royal Order of Isabella the Catholic (1998)[93]\n\n\n### Academic awards[edit]\n\n\n* Laurea in Giurisprudenza (110 e lode) Universit\u00e0 Cattolica Milano (1961)\n* Madras University (India, 1998)\n* Sofia University (Bulgaria, 1998)\n* Universitat Politecnica de Barcelona (Spain, 1998)\n* Brown University (United States, 1999)\n* University of Michigan (United States, 1999)\n* Bucharest Academy of Economic Studies (Romania, 2000)\n* Catholic University of Leuven (Belgium, 2000)\n* University of Malta (Malta, 2000)\n* University of Modena and Reggio Emilia (Italy, 2000)\n* University of Ottawa (Canada, 2000)\n* St. Gallen University (Switzerland, 2000)\n* Kyung Hee University, (South Korea, 2000)\n* Pisa University (Italy, 2001)\n* University of Tirana (Albania, 2001)\n* Carleton University (Canada, 2001)\n* Instituto de Empresa de Madrid (Spain, 2002)\n* University of Oxford, (United Kingdom, 2002)\n* Pavia University, (Italy, 2002)\n* Skopje University, (North Macedonia, 2003)\n* Tunis University, (Tunisia, 2003)\n* University of Calabria (Italy, 2003)\n* Torino University (Italy, 2004)\n* Lublin University (Poland, 2004)\n* Tongji University (P.R.China, 2006)\n* Catholic University of Milan (Italy, 2007)\n* Addis Abeba University (2007)\n* University of Calcutta (2007)\n* University of Freiburg (2008)\n* MIRBIS University Moscow (2009)\n* Chinese Academy of Governance (P.R.China, 2010)\n* University of Nova Gorica (2010)\n* Nankai University (P.R.China, 2010)\n* University of Halle-Wittenberg (Germany, 2011)\n\n## Publications[edit]\n\n\n* *Modello di sviluppo di un settore in rapida crescita: l'industria della ceramica per l'edilizia*, Milan, ed.

On Saturday, Romano Prodi, a former prime minister of Italy, said in an interview that he and an ex-chancellor of Austria, Alfred Gusenbauer, had worked to try to bring Ukraine and the European Union closer together. But Mr. Prodi said the funds he had been paid by Mr. Gusenbauer did not come, to his knowledge, from Mr. Manafort. The compensation from Mr. Gusenbauer was a result of the 'normal private relations I had with him,' Mr. Prodi said, but 'not any money from external sources.' He added: 'I tell you I have never been paid from any lobby group in America.' In a statement to the BBC, Mr. Gusenbauer, who led Austria from January 2007 to December 2008, denied any involvement in Mr. Manafort's work in Ukraine but acknowledged that he had met him twice and talked to European and American politicians about Ukraine, as Mr. Prodi had also done. ... Mr. Prodi said that Mr. Gusenbauer was the 'coordinator' of a group of like-minded liberal and center-left politicians on the issue. ... Mr. Prodi recalled meeting members of Congress interested in Ukraine, but said he had not heard of Mercury. Asked who scheduled the meetings in Washington, Mr. Prodi said, 'I imagine it was Gusenbauer.' ... Asked if the money Mr. Gusenbauer received came from Mr. Manafort, Mr. Prodi seemed skeptical but said that he didn't know. 'Go ask Gusenbauer,' he said, adding that he thought that it was more likely that the money came from European businessmen interested in keeping Europe and Ukraine close.\n32. **^** Meyer, Theodoric; Gerstein, Josh (23 February 2018). \"Former Austrian chancellor appears to have lobbied as part of Manafort scheme\". *Politico*. Retrieved 5 October 2021. Kutler also accompanied Romano Prodi, a former Italian prime minister, to meetings with Royce and a staffer for House Majority Whip Eric Cantor months beforehand. Gusenbauer and Prodi said their work was focused on bringing Ukraine and the European Union closer together and denied being paid by Yanukovych or Manafort. ... Prodi told The New York Times on Saturday that he'd been paid by Gusenbauer as part of the 'normal private relations I had with him' and they the money had not, to his knowledge, come from Manafort. He said he'd never heard of the Hapsburg Group. 'It was Gusenbauer heading the group; we did all our efforts to have peace in Ukraine,' Prodi said. The group, which consisted of 'experts and former politicians,' broke up when it became clear that 'a stronger relationship with the European Union was impossible,' he added.\n33. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** Evans-Pritchard, Ambrose (19 June 2007). \"Italians claim country run by Goldman Sachs\".

An accomplished scholar of dependency theory noted for his research on slavery and political theory, Cardoso has earned many honors including the Prince of Asturias Award for International Cooperation (2000)[3] and the Kluge Prize from the US Library of Congress (2012).[4]\n\n\nCardoso was the 10th president of the International Sociological Association (1982\u20131986).[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Personal and professional life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cardoso walking hand-in-hand with his father in the 1930s\nCardoso descends from wealthy Portuguese immigrants. Some were politicians during the Empire of Brazil.[6] He also has African ancestry, through a black great-great-grandmother and a mulatto great-grandmother.[7] Cardoso described himself as \"slightly mulatto\" and allegedly said he has \"*a foot in the kitchen*\" (a nod to historical Brazilian domestic slavery).[8][9]\n\n\nBorn in Rio de Janeiro, he lived in S\u00e3o Paulo for most of his life. Cardoso is a widower who was married to Ruth Vila\u00e7a Correia Leite Cardoso, an anthropologist, from 1953 until her death on 24 June 2008; they had three children.[10] Educated as a sociologist, he was a professor of political science and sociology at the Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo.[11] and president of the International Sociological Association (ISA), from 1982 to 1986.[5] He is a member of the Institute for Advanced Study (Princeton),[12] an honorary foreign member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and has written several books.\n\n\nCardoso was also associate director of Studies in the \u00c9cole des Hautes \u00c9tudes en Sciences Sociales in Paris, then visiting professor at the Coll\u00e8ge de France and later Paris-Nanterre University.[13] He later gave lectures at British and US universities including Cambridge University, Stanford University, Brown University and the University of California, Berkeley.[13] He is fluent in Portuguese, English, French, and Spanish, and can express himself in Italian and German.[13]\n\n\nAfter his presidency, he was appointed to a five-year term (2003\u20132008) as professor-at-large at Brown University's Watson Institute for International Studies, where he is now on the board of overseers. Cardoso is a founding member of the University of Southern California Center on Public Diplomacy's advisory board.[14] In February 2005, he gave the fourth annual Kissinger Lecture on Foreign Policy and International Relations at the Library of Congress, Washington DC on *\"Dependency and Development in Latin America*.[15]\n\n\nIn 2005, Cardoso was selected by the British magazine *Prospect* as being one of the world's top one hundred living public intellectuals.[16][17][18]\n\n\n\n## Academic career[edit]\n\n\nCardoso earned a bachelor's degree in Social Sciences from Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo in 1952, from where he also earned a Master's and a Doctorate in Sociology. His doctoral thesis, under the supervision of Florestan Fernandes, examined the institution of slavery in Southern Brazil, critiquing, from a Marxist perspective, the dominant approach of Gilberto Freyre to the topic. It has since become a classic on the subject. Cardoso has also received the Livre-Doc\u00eancia degree in 1963, the most senior level of academic recognition in Brazil, also from Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo. In 1968, he received the title of Cathedratic Professor, holding the chair of Political Science at Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo.[11]\n\n\nAs he continued his academic career abroad in Chile and France after the tightening of Brazilian military dictatorship, Cardoso published several books and papers on state bureaucracy, industrial elites and, particularly, dependency theory. His work on dependency would be his most acclaimed contribution to sociology and development studies, especially in the United States.[19] After presiding the International Sociological Association from 1982 to 1986 Cardoso was selected as a Fulbright Program 40th anniversary distinguished fellow and in that capacity was a visiting scholar and lectured at Columbia University on democracy in Brazil.[20] Cardoso currently gives speeches and classes abroad.[21] In June 2013 he was elected as a member of Academia Brasileira de Letras. He said his election was due to recognition for his academic achievements, rather than his political career.[22][23]\n\n\n\n## Elections[edit]\n\n\nAfter his return to Brazil, Fernando Henrique engaged with the burgeoning democratic opposition to the military-dominated regime both as an intellectual and as a political activist. He became Senator from S\u00e3o Paulo for the former Brazilian Democratic Movement (MDB) in 1982, replacing Franco Montoro, the newly elected governor of S\u00e3o Paulo. In 1985, he ran unsuccessfully for mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo against former President J\u00e2nio Quadros. Ahead in the polls, he let himself be photographed in the mayor's chair before the elections. Some attribute his loss to this episode.[24]\n\n\nElected to the Senate in 1986 for the Party of the Brazilian Democratic Movement (PMDB), which MDB became after re-democratization, he joined a group of PMDB parliamentarians who left that party to found the Brazilian Social Democratic Party (PSDB) after previously held PMDB positions shifted to the right when the party filled with politicians who had collaborated with the dictatorship. As senator, Cardoso took part in the 1987\u20131988 National Constituent Assembly that drafted and approved Brazil's current Constitution in the wake of the country's re-democratization. In the early stages of the Constituent Assembly's work (from February to March 1987), Cardoso led the committee that drafted the internal rules of procedure, including the procedural rules governing the drafting of the Constitution itself. These rules of procedure were adopted by the Assembly and published on 25 March 1987. Until 1992, Cardoso served as Leader of the PSDB in the Senate. From October 1992 to May 1993, he served as Minister of Foreign Affairs under President Itamar Franco (PMDB).[25]\n\n\nFrom May 1993 to April 1994, he was Minister of Finance and resigned in April 1994 to launch a presidential campaign. In the 3 October election, he won the presidency in the first round of voting with 54% of the vote, more than twice that of his nearest opponent, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva. This is still the largest margin of victory ever recorded in a free election in Brazilian history. After the constitution was amended to allow a president to succeed himself, he won a second term almost as easily in 1998, taking 53% to Lula's 31.7% to win in a single round. To date, he is the only president to win an outright majority of the popular vote, and the only one to win the presidency in a single round since the institution of the two-round system in 1989.\n\n\nCardoso was succeeded in 2003 by Lula da Silva, who ran for the fourth time and had come in second on prior attempts. Lula won in the runoff election against the Cardoso-supported candidate, Jos\u00e9 Serra. Lula's election has been interpreted as resulting from Cardoso's low approval ratings in his second term.[26]\n\n\n\n## Presidency (1995\u20132003)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cardoso with Nelson Mandela at the 2nd World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference in Geneva, Switzerland, 18 May 1998\n![](image)Cardoso meets with George W. Bush in the Oval Office in 2001\n![](image)Cardoso with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow in January 2002 Cardoso, often nicknamed \"FHC\", was elected with the support of a heterodox alliance of his own Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB) and two right-wing parties, the Liberal Front Party (PFL) and the Brazilian Labour Party (PTB). Brazil's largest party, the centrist Party of the Brazilian Democratic Movement (PMDB), joined Cardoso's governing coalition after the election, as did the right-wing Brazilian Progressive Party (PPB) in 1996.\n\n\nParty loyalty was not always strong, and coalition members did not always vote with the government. Cardoso had difficulty at times gaining support for some of his legislative priorities, even though his coalition held an overwhelming majority of the congressional seats. Nevertheless, many constitutional amendments were passed during his presidency.[*clarification needed*]\n\n\nCardoso's presidency saw institutional advancements in human rights, beginning with a national secretariat and a new government program, discussed with the civil society, to address the issue. On 8 January 1996, he issued the controversial Decree 1775, which created a framework for the clear demarcation of indigenous territories, but which, as part of the process, opened indigenous territories to counterclaims by adjacent landowners. In 2000, Cardoso demanded the disclosure of some classified military files concerning Operation Condor, a network of South American military dictatorships that kidnapped and assassinated political opponents.[27]\n\n\nFHC was the first Brazilian President to address the inequality and the enormous gap between rich and poor. He started the following programs: Bolsa Escola, the Aux\u00edlio G\u00e1s, the Bolsa Alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o, and the Cart\u00e3o Alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o.[28]\n\n\nHis wife, Ruth Cardoso, focused on unifying transfer programs aimed at helping people suffering from poverty and hunger.,[29][30][31] by means of a program based on the idea that educating the poor could help raise them out of poverty.[32]\n\n\nCardoso's administration deepened the privatization program launched by president Fernando Collor de Mello. During his first term, several government-owned enterprises in areas such as steel milling, telecommunications and mining, such as *Telebras* and *Companhia Vale do Rio Doce* were sold to the private sector, the deepest denationalisation in Brazilian history, amidst a polarized political debate between \"neoliberals\" and \"developmentalists\". Ironically, this time Cardoso was against the latter group, generating uproar among former academic colleagues and political allies who accused him of reneging his previous intellectual work. Economists still contend over its long-term effects; some research suggests that companies sold by the government achieved better profitability as a result of their disengagement from the state.[33]\n\n\n\n![](image)Outgoing president Cardoso, with his wife Ruth (right), at the inauguration of Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva on 1 January 2003\nDespite the sale of public assets, the years 1995 to 2002 saw a rise of the total public debt from 30% to 55.5% of GDP. Economists aligned with his government argued that this was due to external factors outside the control of the administration at the time, such as the devaluation of the Brazilian real and the growth of the share of the debt denominated in US dollars.[34] Nevertheless, devaluation of the currency was an instrument of monetary policy used right after his reelection, when the real pegged to the dollar led to a financial crisis that saw the country lose much of its foreign reserve fund and raise its interest rates on government bonds to very high levels as he tried to stabilize the currency under a new free-floating regime. With this economic shift, the greatest achievement of Cardoso \u2013 his landmark lowering of inflation \u2013 was maintained, but his popularity plummeted.\n\n\nGiven his previous experience as Minister of Foreign Affairs and his prestige as an internationally famous sociologist, he was respected on the world scene, building friendships with such leaders as Bill Clinton and Ernesto Zedillo. Although he was respected abroad, in Brazil he had problems gaining support in Congress for government priorities and among people in general. As a result, major reforms planned by the executive branch, such as changes in the tax system and to social security, were only partially approved and only after long discussion. Although claiming to still support social democracy, his economic policies led people on the left to identify him with neoliberalism and right-wing politics, terms that often carry a very negative connotation in Latin American political debate and academic circles.\n\n\n\n![](image)Foreign trips of Cardoso during his presidency\nHe also experienced personal problems with former ally Itamar Franco, his predecessor and later became Governor of Minas Gerais, a fierce opponent of his administrative reforms that saw the state lose its capacity to contract debt and forced a reduction of local government spending. Cardoso was also criticized for amending the constitution to his own benefit, allowing him to stay eight years in office. His popularity in his first four years, gained with the success of Plano Real, decreased during his last four years as the currency crisis was followed by lower economic growth and employment rates, greater public debt, growing political dissent, low levels of investment in appropriate infrastructure, and, finally, an energy crisis caused by an unexpected drought, as over 80% of Brazil's electricity is hydroelectric. He publicly admitted that he could have done more for public security and for the creation of new jobs, but defended his policies in areas such as health and education.\n\n\nCardoso's administration was accused of bribing congressmen to pass a constitutional amendment that secured FHC the right to seek a reelection, which he eventually won.[35]\n\n\n\n## Post-presidency[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Former presidents (from right), Sarney, Collor and Cardoso, April 2008\nAfter stepping down from office, he assumed a position as a senior leader of his party and leading public voice in the opposition to the incumbent Workers' Party, writing extensively on Brazilian politics for newspapers and giving lectures and interviews. Nevertheless, his relatively low popularity rates among the general population have made his legacy a mixed blessing to his political allies, who are somewhat reluctant to embrace it wholeheartedly during elections, especially on topics regarding privatization and social policy. In 2006, he helped the campaign of the PSDB candidate for the Presidency, Geraldo Alckmin, and has reiterated that he does not wish to run for office again. In the 2022 presidential election, Cardoso endorsed his former Workers' Party rival Lula over then-incumbent Jair Bolsonaro.[36]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cardoso speaks at the National Congress during a ceremony to mark the 15th anniversary of the Real Plan in July 2009\n![](image)Former President Cardoso and then-President of Argentina Cristina Kirchner in the Casa Rosada, Buenos Aires, 3 December 2009\n![](image)Cardoso during his induction ceremony at the Brazilian Academy of Letters, 10 September 2013\nHe dedicates his time to a personal institute which he founded in S\u00e3o Paulo, based on the model of bodies created by former presidents of the United States, has written two books about his experience as president of Brazil and advocates for relaxation of criminal laws relating to drugs, generating both criticism and praise. He lectures at Brown University about Brazilian economic policy, urban development, and deforestation and has taught as a guest lecturer at Sciences Po in Paris.[37] Also, in 2007 he became a member of the editorial board of the Latin American policy publication *Americas Quarterly*, for which he is an occasional contributor.[38][39]\n\n\nSince leaving the Brazilian presidency, Cardoso has been involved in a number of international organisations and initiatives. He is a member of the Club of Madrid and was its president from 2003 to 2006.[40] He has been a member of the Fondation Chirac's honour committee,[41] ever since the Foundation was launched in 2008 by former French president Jacques Chirac to promote world peace. Cardoso is a founding member of Washington D.C.-based think tank The Inter-American Dialogue as well as former chair of the organization's board. He is also a former director of World Resources Institute.[42][43]\n\n\nCardoso has a particular interest in drug policy. He served on the Latin American Commission on Drugs and Democracy and later chaired the Global Commission on Drug Policy.[44] He appeared as an interviewee in 2011 documentary Breaking the Taboo, which explores the conclusion reached by the Global Commission on Drug Policy in 2011 that drug liberalization is the best approach in dealing with drug policy.\n\n\nCardoso is also a member of The Elders, a group of independent global leaders who work together on peace and human rights issues.[45] In August 2009, he travelled to Israel and the West Bank as the head of an Elders delegation that also included Ela Bhatt, Gro Harlem Brundtland, Jimmy Carter, Mary Robinson and Desmond Tutu.[46]\n\n\nIn 2013 he became a member of the Brazilian Academy of Letters.\n\n\nIn 2017, Cardoso received the Distinguished Lifetime Achievement Award from the Inter-American Dialogue.\n\n\n\n## Honours[edit]\n\n\n### Foreign honours[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)\u00a0Argentina: Collar of the Order of the Liberator General San Mart\u00edn\n* ![](image)\u00a0Bolivia: Collar of the Order of the Condor of the Andes\n* ![](image)\u00a0Chile: Collar of the Order of Merit (Chile)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Colombia: Collar of the Order of Boyac\u00e1\n* ![](image)\u00a0Costa Rica: Gran Cross of the Order of Juan Mora Fern\u00e1ndez\n* ![](image)\u00a0Denmark: Knight of the Order of the Elephant[47]\n* ![](image)\u00a0Ecuador: Collar of the National Order of Merit (Ecuador)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Finland: Gran Cross with Collar of the Order of the White Rose of Finland\n* ![](image)\u00a0France:\n\t+ Gran Cross of the Legion of Honour\n\t+ Officier of the Ordre des Palmes acad\u00e9miques\n* ![](image)\u00a0Germany: Grand Cross Special Class of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany\n* ![](image)\u00a0Hungary: Grand Cross with Chain of the Hungarian Order of Merit\n* ![](image)\u00a0Italy: Collar of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic (1995)[48]\n* ![](image)\u00a0Japan: Grand Cordon of the Order of the Chrysanthemum\n* ![](image)\u00a0KSA: Collar of the Order of King Abdulaziz\n* ![](image)\u00a0Malaysia: Honorary Recipient of the Order of the Crown of the Realm (1995)[49]\n* ![](image)\u00a0Mexico: Collar of the Order of the Aztec Eagle\n* ![](image)\u00a0Panama: Gran Cross of the Order of Manuel Amador Guerrero\n* ![](image)\u00a0Paraguay: Gran Cross of the National Order of Merit (Paraguay)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Peru:\n\t+ Grand Cross with diamonds of the Order of the Sun of Peru\n\t+ Gran Cross of the National Order of Merit\n* ![](image)\u00a0Portugal:[50]\n\t+ Collar of the Order of Prince Henry (2000)\n\t+ Collar of the Order of Liberty (1995)\n\t+ Grand Cross of the Order of Merit (1987)\n\t+ Collar of the Military Order of Saint James of the Sword (1997)\n\t+ Grand Cross of the Order of the Tower and Sword (2002)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Poland:\n\t+ Order of the White Eagle (2002)[51]\n\t+ Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland (1995)[52]\n* ![](image)\u00a0Romania: Order of the Star of Romania\n* ![](image)\u00a0South Africa: Gran Cross of the Order of Good Hope\n* ![](image)\u00a0South Korea: Grand Order of Mugunghwa\n* ![](image)\u00a0Spain: Collar of the Order of Isabella the Catholic (1998)[53]\n* ![](image)\u00a0Slovakia: Grand Cross (or 1st Class) of the Order of the White Double Cross (2001)[54][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*]\n* ![](image)\u00a0Suriname: Grand Cross of the Honorary Order of the Yellow Star\n* ![](image)\u00a0Ukraine: First Class of the Order of Prince Yaroslav the Wise\n* ![](image)\u00a0Uruguay: Medal of the Oriental Republic of Uruguay (1995)[55]\n* ![](image)\u00a0United Kingdom: Honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (1997)[56]\n* ![](image)\u00a0United States: Kluge Prize, 2012[57][58]\n* ![](image)\u00a0Venezuela:\n\t+ Collar of the Order of the Liberator\n\t+ Gran Cross of the Order of Francisco de Miranda\n\n\n### Honorary doctorate[edit]\n\n\n* 1978 Honorary Doctor of Laws, Rutgers University\n* 2001 Honorary Doctor of Law, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel (awarded in S\u00e3o Paulo on 11/18)\n* 2012 Honorary Doctor of Sociology, ISCTE-IUL, Portugal\n* 2016, Honorary Doctor of Laws, Harvard University (awarded in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on 26 May 2016).\n\n\n## Selected works[edit]\n\n\n* Cardoso, Fernando Henrique (2006) *The Accidental President of Brazil*, PublicAffairs, ISBN\u00a01-58648-324-2\n* Cardoso, Fernando Henrique (2001) *Charting a New Course: The Politics of Globalization and Social Transformation*, Rowman & Littlefield, ISBN\u00a00-7425-0893-5\n* Goertzel, Ted G.
