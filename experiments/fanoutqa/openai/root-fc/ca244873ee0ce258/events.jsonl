His feature directorial debut was the neo-noir crime thriller *Following* (1998) which was made on a shoestring budget of $6,000.[1][note 1] Two years later, he directed the psychological thriller *Memento* (2000) which starred Guy Pearce as a man suffering from anterograde amnesia (short-term memory loss) searching for his wife's killers.[3] Similar to his debut feature it had a non-linear narrative structure, and was his breakthrough film.[4] It was acclaimed by critics and was a surprise commercial success.[5] For the film Nolan received his first nomination for the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing – Feature Film, and for writing its screenplay he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.[6][7] He next directed the mystery thriller remake *Insomnia* (2002) which starred Al Pacino, Robin Williams, and Hilary Swank.[8] It was his first film for Warner Bros., and was a critical and commercial success.[9][10]\n\n\nIn 2005, Nolan directed Warner Bros' superhero film *Batman Begins* which starred Christian Bale and told an origin story of the title character.[11] The following year, he directed psychological thriller *The Prestige* (2006) in which Bale and Hugh Jackman played rival 19th-century stage magicians.[12] His next film was the sequel to *Batman Begins*, *The Dark Knight*, in which Bale reprised his role as Batman opposite Heath Ledger as the Joker. The film grossed a worldwide total of over $1 billion, and was the highest grossing of 2008.[13] It received eight nominations at the 81st Academy Awards, and Nolan received his second nomination at the Directors Guild of America Awards.[14][15] In 2010, he directed the action film *Inception* starring Leonardo DiCaprio as a thief who leads a team who steal information by entering a person's subconscious.[16] It was nominated for Best Film at the Academy Awards, British Academy Film Awards, and Golden Globe Awards, and Nolan received his third nomination at the Directors Guild of America Awards.[17]\n\n\nTwo years later, he directed *The Dark Knight Rises* (2012), which grossed a worldwide total at the box office of over $1 billion.[18] He followed this by producing Zack Snyder's superhero film *Man of Steel* (2013) and directing the science fiction film *Interstellar* (2014), which starred Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, and Jessica Chastain. It won the Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film.[19] In 2017, Nolan directed the war film *Dunkirk*, for which he received his first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Director.[20] Three years later he directed the science fiction film *Tenet* (2020).[21] His next feature was *Oppenheimer* (2023), a biopic centered on J. Robert Oppenheimer, with Cillian Murphy starring as the titular character.[22]\n\n\n\n\n## Feature films[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Director | Writer | Producer | Notes\n | Ref(s) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1998\n | *Following* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | Also cinematographer and editor\n | [23] |\n| 2000\n | *Memento* | Yes\n | Yes\n | No\n |  | [23][24] |\n| 2002\n | *Insomnia* | Yes\n | No\n | No\n |  | [23][24] |\n| 2005\n | *Batman Begins* | Yes\n | Yes\n | No\n |  | [23][24] |\n| 2006\n | *The Prestige* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n |  | [23][24] |\n| 2008\n | *The Dark Knight* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n |  | [23][24] |\n| 2010\n | *Inception* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n |  | [23][24] |\n| 2012\n | *The Dark Knight Rises* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n |  | [23][24] |\n| 2013\n | *Man of Steel* | No\n | Story\n | Yes\n |  | [23] |\n| 2014\n | *Interstellar* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n |  | [23][24] |\n| 2017\n | *Dunkirk* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n |  | [23][24] |\n| 2020\n | *Tenet* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n |  | [9][25] |\n| 2023\n | *Oppenheimer* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n |  | [26] |\n\n\n**Executive producer**\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Notes\n | Ref(s) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2014\n | *Transcendence* |  | [23][24] |\n| 2016\n | *Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice* |  | [23][24] |\n| 2017\n | *Justice League* |  | [23][24] |\n| 2019\n | *The Doll's Breath* | Animated short film\n | [27] |\n| 2021\n | *Zack Snyder's Justice League* | Director's cut of 2017's *Justice League* | [28] |\n\n\n## Short films[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Director | Writer | Producer | Cinematographer | Editor | Notes\n | Ref(s) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1989\n | *Tarantella* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | No official release, available on Media Burn Independent Video ArchiveCo-directed with Roko Belic | [23][29] |\n| 1996\n | *Larceny* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | No official release\n | [23][24] |\n| 1997\n | *Doodlebug* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n |  | [23] |\n| 2015\n | *Quay* | Yes\n | No\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | Also composerDocumentary short\n | [23] |\n\n\n## Documentary appearances[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Ref(s) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2011\n | *These Amazing Shadows* | [24] |\n| 2012\n | *Side by Side* | [23][24] |\n| 2016\n | *Cinema Futures* | [30] |\n| 2018\n | *James Cameron's Story of Science Fiction* | [31] |\n| 2019\n | *Making Waves: The Art of Cinematic Sound* | [32] |\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n\n1. **^** Nolan directed a feature, *Larry Mahoney*, in the mid-1990s, but it was scrapped and never released.[2]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Sims, David (16 March 2016). \"How Memento Set the Framework for Christopher Nolan's Career\". *The Atlantic*.

Robert Oppenheimer, the American theoretical physicist credited with being the \"father of the atomic bomb\" for his role in the Manhattan Project—the World War II undertaking that developed the first nuclear weapons. Based on the 2005 biography *American Prometheus* by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, the film chronicles the career of Oppenheimer, with the story predominantly focusing on his studies, his direction of the Manhattan Project during World War II, and his eventual fall from grace due to his 1954 security hearing. The film also stars Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer's wife \"Kitty\", Matt Damon as head of the Manhattan Project Leslie Groves, Robert Downey Jr. as U.S. Atomic Energy Commission member Lewis Strauss, and Florence Pugh as Oppenheimer's communist lover Jean Tatlock. The ensemble supporting cast includes Josh Hartnett, Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, and Kenneth Branagh.\n\n\nThe film was announced in September 2021 after Universal Pictures won a bidding war for Nolan's screenplay, following Nolan's conflict with longtime distributor Warner Bros. Murphy was the first cast member to sign on the following month, with the rest of the cast joining between November 2021 and April 2022. Pre-production was under way by January 2022, and filming took place from February to May. *Oppenheimer* was filmed in a combination of IMAX 65 mm and 65 mm large-format film, including, for the first time, scenes in IMAX black-and-white film photography. Like his previous works, Nolan made extensive use of practical effects, with minimal computer-generated imagery used to perfect the former. Editing was handled by Jennifer Lame, and the score was composed by Ludwig Göransson. The film is Nolan's fourth to receive an R-rating in the United States, preceded by *Following* (1998), *Memento* (2000) and *Insomnia* (2002).\n\n\n*Oppenheimer* premiered at Le Grand Rex in Paris on July 11, 2023, and was theatrically released in the United States and the United Kingdom on July 21 by Universal. Its simultaneous release with Warner Bros.'s *Barbie* led to the Barbenheimer cultural phenomenon, which encouraged audiences to see both films as a double feature. The film received critical acclaim and grossed over $950 million worldwide, becoming the third-highest-grossing film of 2023, the highest-grossing World War II-related film, the highest-grossing biographical film, and the second-highest-grossing R-rated film.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn 1926, 22-year-old doctoral student J. Robert Oppenheimer grapples with anxiety and homesickness while studying under experimental physicist Patrick Blackett at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge. Upset with the demanding Blackett, Oppenheimer leaves him a poisoned apple but later retrieves it. Visiting scientist Niels Bohr recommends that Oppenheimer instead study theoretical physics at Göttingen. \n\n\nHe completes his PhD there and meets fellow scientist Isidor Isaac Rabi. They later meet theoretical physicist Werner Heisenberg in Switzerland. Wanting to expand quantum physics research in the United States, Oppenheimer begins teaching at the University of California, Berkeley, and the California Institute of Technology. He marries Katherine \"Kitty\" Puening, a biologist and ex-communist, and has an intermittent affair with Jean Tatlock, a troubled Communist Party USA member who later commits suicide.\n\n\nIn December 1938, nuclear fission is discovered, which Oppenheimer realizes could be weaponized. In 1942, during World War II, U.S. Army General Leslie Groves recruits Oppenheimer to lead the Manhattan Project to develop an atomic bomb. Oppenheimer, who is Jewish, is particularly driven by the Nazis' potentially completing their nuclear weapons program, headed by Heisenberg. \n\n\nHe assembles a scientific team including Rabi and Edward Teller in Los Alamos, New Mexico, and also collaborates with scientists Enrico Fermi, Leo Szilard and David L. Hill at the University of Chicago. Teller's calculations reveal an atomic detonation could possibly trigger a catastrophic chain reaction that ignites the atmosphere. After consulting with Albert Einstein, Oppenheimer concludes the chances are acceptably low. Teller's proposal to construct a hydrogen bomb is swiftly rejected. He attempts to leave the project, though Oppenheimer convinces him to stay.\n\n\nFollowing Adolf Hitler's death in 1945, some Project scientists question the bomb's relevance, while Oppenheimer believes it will end the ongoing war in the Pacific and save Allied lives. The Trinity test is successful, and President Harry S. Truman orders Hiroshima and Nagasaki to be bombed, forcing Japan's surrender. Though publicly praised, Oppenheimer is haunted by the mass destruction and fatalities, and urges restricting further nuclear weapons development, which Truman curtly dismisses. \n\n\nAs an advisor to the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), Oppenheimer's stance generates controversy, while Teller's hydrogen bomb receives renewed interest amidst the burgeoning Cold War. AEC Chairman Lewis Strauss resents Oppenheimer for having publicly humiliated him by dismissing his concerns about exporting radioisotopes, and for recommending negotiations with the Soviet Union after they successfully detonated their own bomb. He also believes that Oppenheimer denigrated him during a conversation Oppenheimer had with Einstein in 1947.\n\n\nIn 1954, wanting to eliminate Oppenheimer's political influence, Strauss secretly orchestrates a private hearing before a Personnel Security Board concerning Oppenheimer's Q clearance. However, it becomes clear that the hearing has a predetermined outcome. Oppenheimer's past communist ties are exploited, and Groves' and other associates' testimony is twisted against him. \n\n\nTeller testifies that he lacks confidence in Oppenheimer and recommends revocation. The board revokes Oppenheimer's clearance, damaging his public image and limiting his influence on nuclear policy. In 1959, during Strauss' Senate confirmation hearing for Secretary of Commerce, Hill testifies about Strauss' personal motives in engineering Oppenheimer's downfall, resulting in the Senate voting against his nomination.\n\n\nIn 1963, President Lyndon B. Johnson presents Oppenheimer with the Enrico Fermi Award as a gesture of political rehabilitation. A flashback reveals that Oppenheimer and Einstein's 1947 conversation never mentioned Strauss. Oppenheimer instead expressed his somber belief that he had started a chain reaction that might destroy the world.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n![Actor Cillian Murphy at a press conference for The Party at the 67th Berlin International Film Festival in 2017](image)\n![Portrait of J.

After that project failed to materialize, and the book was optioned by various filmmakers over the fifteen years following, the authors grew pessimistic about seeing their work adapted to the screen. At one point Oliver Stone was offered the opportunity to direct, but turned it down because he \"couldn't find my way to its essence\".[51] In 2015, J. David Wargo optioned the book, then commissioned and rejected several scripts. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Wargo flew to Hollywood to meet with actor James Woods, who set up a meeting with Charles Roven, a producer for various Christopher Nolan films, and in turn, Roven gave a copy of the book to Nolan. Both Wargo and Woods are executive producers of the film.[52]\n\n\nNolan had long desired to make a film about Oppenheimer, even prior to reading *American Prometheus*.[53] In 2019, towards the end of production on Nolan's science-fiction film *Tenet* (2020), star Robert Pattinson gave the director a book of Oppenheimer's speeches. According to Nolan, the speeches showed the physicist \"wrestling with the implications ... of what's happened and what [he's] done\". Nolan wanted to depict \"what it would have been like to be Oppenheimer in those moments\" in contrast to *Tenet*, which employs time travel to curb a potential weapon of mass destruction.[54][2]\n\n\nIn December 2020, Warner Bros. Pictures announced plans to give its 2021 films simultaneous releases in theaters and on HBO Max, citing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the film industry. Nolan, who had partnered with the studio on each one of his films starting with *Insomnia* (2002), was outraged with the decision as he had been a proponent of film theaters.[55] In January 2021, media reports mentioned the possibility that Nolan's next film could be the first not to be financed or distributed by Warner Bros.[56] By mid-2021, the filmmaker had left Warner Bros. and was meeting with other studios to develop his new project.[2] Nolan had previously supported the studio's decision to give *Wonder Woman 1984* (2020) a simultaneous release, stating that he perceived that situation to have been handled properly, but said he had been excluded from any discussions regarding the postponed release of *Tenet*.[57][58]\n\n\nIn September 2021, it was announced that Nolan would write and direct a biographical film set during World War II about Oppenheimer, with Cillian Murphy in negotiations to star.[59][60] Due to his strained relationship with Warner Bros., Nolan approached multiple studios for the project, including Sony, Universal, Paramount, and Apple.[61][62] According to insiders, Paramount was ruled out early in the process in relation to the replacement of CEO and chairman Jim Gianopulos with Brian Robbins, an advocate for increased streaming-service releases.[62]\n\n\nNolan ended up going to Universal because he had previously worked with Donna Langley, chairwoman and chief content officer of the NBCUniversal studio group, on an unsuccessful attempt to make a film version of the UK television series *The Prisoner*. He was unable to \"'crack' the adaptation\", but they stayed in touch.[63] Langley agreed with Nolan's strong stance in favor of traditional film exhibition in theaters. Therefore, Universal agreed to finance and distribute *Oppenheimer*, with production set to begin in the first quarter of 2022.[64] The studio also agreed to Nolan's terms, which included a production budget of $100 million, an equal marketing budget, an exclusive theatrical window ranging from 90 to 120 days, 20 percent of the film's first-dollar gross, and a three-week period both before and after the film's opening in which Universal could not release another new film.[62][2]\n\n\n\n### Writing[edit]\n\n\n![Christopher Nolan at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival.](image)Writer, director, and producer Christopher Nolan\n*Oppenheimer* is the first screenplay written by Nolan in the first person, as he wanted the narrative to be conveyed from Oppenheimer's perspective. He described the \"texture\" of the film being \"how the personal interacts with the historic and the geopolitical\" with the intention of making it a cautionary tale.[53][65][66] He began developing the script after he completed *Tenet* and wrote it in only a few months; he had already been thinking about making a film about Oppenheimer for over 20 years.[53] A major plot element is Oppenheimer's response to the long-term consequences of his actions. Nolan wished to explore the phenomenon of delayed reactions, as he felt people are not \"necessarily confronted with the strongest or worst elements of [their actions] in the moment\".[67] He also chose to alternate between scenes in color and black-and-white to convey the story from both subjective and objective perspectives, respectively,[68] with most of Oppenheimer's view shown via the former, while the latter depicts a \"more objective view of his story from a different character's point of view\".[69][67] Wanting to make the film as subjective as possible, the production team decided to include visions of Oppenheimer's conceptions of the quantum world and waves of energy.[70] Nolan noted that Oppenheimer never publicly apologized for his role in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but still desired to portray Oppenheimer as feeling genuine guilt for his actions, believing this to be accurate.[71]\n\n\n\n> \n> I think of any character I've dealt with, Oppenheimer is by far the most ambiguous and paradoxical. Which, given that I've made three Batman films, is saying a lot.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n— Christopher Nolan, *Total Film*[72]\n\nNolan began by trying to find the \"thread that connected the quantum realm, the vibration of energy, and Oppenheimer's own personal journey\" and sought to portray the difficulties in his life, particularly regarding his sex life.[54] As such, Nolan wanted to candidly portray his affair with Jean Tatlock. He also wanted to explore Tatlock's influence on Oppenheimer's life, since she was a Communist, which had \"enormous ramifications for [Oppenheimer's] later life and his ultimate fate\".[73] Nolan also sought to explore the relationship between Oppenheimer and Admiral Lewis Strauss, former chair of the Atomic Energy Commission, having been inspired by the relationship between Mozart and Antonio Salieri as depicted in *Amadeus* (1984).[67]\n\n\nAnother critical moment of the film was the meeting in which President Harry S. Truman called Oppenheimer a \"crybaby\". Nolan wanted to convey the scene from Oppenheimer's perspective and felt it was a \"massive moment of disillusion, a huge turning point [for Oppenheimer] in his approach to trying to deal with the consequences of what he'd been involved with\", while also underscoring that it is a \"huge shift in perception about the reality of Oppenheimer's perception\".[53] He wanted to execute a quick tonal shift after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, desiring to go from the \"highest triumphalism, the highest high, to the lowest low in the shortest amount of screen time possible\".[66] For the ending, Nolan chose to make it intentionally vague to be open to interpretation and refrained from being didactic or conveying specific messages in his work. However, he did have the intention to have a \"strong set of troubling reverberations at the end\".[71]\n\n\nNolan first became aware of Oppenheimer as a youth, after hearing the lyric \"How can I save my little boy from Oppenheimer's deadly toy?\" in the Sting song \"Russians\" (1985).[67] He was also inspired by his fears of nuclear holocaust throughout childhood, as he lived during the era of Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) and the anti-nuclear protests in RAF Greenham Common. He felt that \"while our relationship with that [nuclear] fear has ebbed and flowed with time, the threat itself never actually went away\", and felt the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine had caused a resurgence of nuclear anxiety.[54] Nolan had also penned a script for a biopic of Howard Hughes approximately during the time of production of Martin Scorsese's *The Aviator* (2004), which had given him insight on how to write a script regarding a person's life.[53] Emily Blunt described the *Oppenheimer* script as \"emotional\" and resembling that of a thriller, while also remarking that Nolan had \"Trojan-Horsed a biopic into a thriller\".[72]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\n*Oppenheimer* marks the sixth collaboration between Nolan and Murphy, and the first starring Murphy as the lead. To prepare for the role, the actor did what he summarized as \"an awful lot of reading\" on Oppenheimer's life and had also been inspired by David Bowie's appearance in the 1970s.[74][8][67] Nolan called Murphy one day to ask him to play the part, and Murphy enthusiastically accepted and was excited to play a lead role in a Nolan film. Afterward, Nolan flew to Dublin to meet with Murphy, who read the script in Nolan's hotel room.[75] Murphy lost an undisclosed amount of weight for the role in order to better match the real-life Oppenheimer's gaunt appearance.[76] Nolan also set up a phone call between Murphy and Nobel laureate Kip Thorne, who had previously worked with Nolan on *Interstellar* (2014).[53] As a graduate student, Thorne had attended some of Oppenheimer's seminars, and explained to Murphy his experience with Oppenheimer's gift for facilitating group discussions of difficult scientific concepts.[53]\n\n\nThe casting process was so secretive that some cast members did not know which role they would be playing until they signed on.[35] Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon, and Emily Blunt took pay cuts to work on the film, with each earning $4 million in lieu of their usual $10–20 million upfront salary.[77] Downey went to Nolan's house to read the script, which was printed in black on red paper.[78] Downey would later describe *Oppenheimer* as \"the best film\" in which he has appeared to date.[79] Blunt met Nolan in Los Angeles and, when she was offered the role of Katherine \"Kitty\" Oppenheimer, she enthusiastically accepted; she also contacted Murphy to get an expectation of what working with Nolan would be like.[78] Asked to play the part of Leslie Groves, Damon—who had appeared in Nolan's *Interstellar*—was taking a break from acting as a result of negotiations with his wife in couples therapy, but signed on to *Oppenheimer* as he had reserved one exception: if Nolan offered him a role in a film.[80] Nolan cast writer-director Benny Safdie as physicist Edward Teller after asking director Paul Thomas Anderson about his experience directing Safdie in *Licorice Pizza* (2021).[81] Safdie had worked alongside a nuclear physicist at Columbia University while in high school.[67]\n\n\nIt is Nolan's first film since *Batman Begins* (2005) to not feature Michael Caine. When asked about Caine's absence from the film, Nolan stated, \"He's with us in spirit, but not an actual actor. No, no. He wasn't able to join us for this one. But he's always with us in spirit, and I've had the most wonderful collaboration with him over the years.\"[82][83]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nFilming took place at the University of California, Berkeley in May 2022.\n\nPre-production had begun by January 2022 in New Mexico, where a two-day casting call took place in Santa Fe and Los Alamos for people to audition to play local residents, military personnel, and scientists.[84][85] Another casting call was held in February.[86]\n\n\nPrincipal photography began on February 28, 2022, at Ghost Ranch in New Mexico,[87] and lasted for 57 days with Hoyte van Hoytema serving as cinematographer.[76][22] The original shooting schedule had set aside approximately 85 days for principal photography.[88] During pre-production, it had become clear there was no way to shoot a feature film for $100 million over that many days on location all over the United States.[88] To free up money in the film's budget for location shooting in California and New Jersey and for construction of high-quality historically accurate sets in New Mexico, Nolan compressed the shooting schedule to 55 days.[88] Murphy, who appears in nearly every scene, described the pace as \"insane\".[88]\n\n\nGary Oldman said he would be on set for a day in May for \"one scene, a page and a half\".[50] Nolan filmed his eldest child, his daughter Flora, in a scene in which she played a young woman disintegrated in a nuclear explosion. It appears in the film as one of Oppenheimer's visions, in which Nolan intended to show \"that if you create the ultimate destructive power, it will also destroy those who are near and dear to you\".[54]\n\n\nThe film used a combination of IMAX 65 mm and 65 mm large-format film.[8] It is also the first film to shoot sections on IMAX black-and-white photographic film, which Kodak created and FotoKem developed specifically for the film.[89][90] Van Hoytema used 50 mm and 80 mm Hasselblad lenses when filming on the IMAX MKIV or IMAX MSM 9802 cameras, while scenes shot on the Panavision Panaflex System 65 Studio cameras were shot using Panavision Sphero 65 and Panavision System 65 lenses. Said Van Hoytema, \"When shooting our close-ups, we didn't want the camera to be six feet away from our subject. We wanted to be much tighter, so that you really feel the perspective and the intimacy. Also, I knew we would be filming in low-light situations and would need to shoot at T1.4 rather than a T4.\"[91] Additionally, the production had Panavision construct a custom probe lens to allow the filmmakers to use IMAX cameras for macro photography and microphotography to record the film's miniature effects.[92] In the second week of April, filming took place on location at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.[93] Filming also occurred in California,[49] primarily around the campus of the University of California, Berkeley.[94] Scenes set in the city of Berkeley itself were filmed in Pasadena.[95]\n\n\nDuring a 2021 research trip, Nolan discovered that Los Alamos had drastically changed from its 1940s appearance and could not be used for exterior shots of the town; for example, the town's equivalent of a Main Street has a Starbucks.[87] Instead, the production team constructed a version of 1940s-era Los Alamos on top of a similar plateau at Ghost Ranch.[87] It took three months to build the set, which was used for only six shooting days.[87] The general plan was to shoot only exterior shots on the set at Ghost Ranch, then shoot interior shots on location inside various historic buildings in the real town of Los Alamos.[95] Interior shooting in Los Alamos began on March 8, 2022.[87] Many scenes in the film take place in academic lecture halls; to save time and money, the production team decided against attempting to reconstruct those halls as sets at Ghost Ranch, and shot them inside a historic Women's Army Corps dormitory in Los Alamos.[87] Scenes were also filmed in Oppenheimer's original cabin in Los Alamos, which had been restored. Kai Bird visited the set and was impressed by Murphy's performance as Oppenheimer during filming.[96] The New York hotel scenes were shot in Albuquerque's Old Post Office building, while the Washington, D.C. scenes were shot in state government buildings in the state capital of Santa Fe.[95]\n\n\nFilming involved the use of real explosives to recreate the Trinity nuclear test, forgoing the use of computer-generated graphics.[97] When this news first broke online, many fans (aware of Nolan's famous preference for in-camera practical effects) thought it meant he had set off a real atomic bomb.[2] Nolan later remarked that it was both \"flattering\" and \"scary\" that his fans would think that of him.[2] The production team was able to obtain government permission to film at White Sands Missile Range, but only at highly inconvenient hours, and therefore chose to film the scene elsewhere in the New Mexico desert.[2][95] The production filmed the Trinity test scenes in Belen, New Mexico, with Murphy climbing a 100-foot steel tower, a replica of the original site used in the Manhattan Project, in rough weather.[2][95] A special set was built in which gasoline, propane, aluminum powder, and magnesium were used to create the explosive effect.[54] Although they used miniatures for the practical effect, the film's special effects supervisor Scott R. Fisher referred to them as \"big-atures\", since the special effects team had tried to build the models as physically large as possible. To make the models look closer to their intended real-life size, the team used forced perspective.[98][99] Visualizations of the interactions between atoms, molecules and energy waves, as well as the depiction of stars, black holes and supernovas, were also achieved through practical methods. Nolan claimed the film contains no computer-generated effects,[100] and used practical effects to achieve \"real-world imagery\".[101] Filming wrapped in May 2022.[102]\n\n\n\n### Post-production[edit]\n\n\nDuring post-production, editing was completed by Jennifer Lame, who had previously edited *Tenet*.[8] While inspecting the footage during editing, Nolan and Lame performed \"character passes\" to ensure all the characters were properly displayed on screen, due to the film having a faster pace than most traditional blockbusters.[67] Visual effects were handled by DNEG, which produced more than 100 VFX shots from more than 400 practically shot elements,[103] marking their eighth collaboration with Nolan. Andrew Jackson was the visual effects supervisor,[104] who stated that the film utilized mostly \"invisible\" visual effects through \"'in-camera' special effects created on set\".[105] Digital compositing was used for the Trinity scene to add multi-layers to the explosion which was shot in a multifaceted viewpoint.[106]\n\n\n\n## Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Oppenheimer (soundtrack)\n\nLudwig Göransson composed the score for the film, after doing so for Nolan's previous film, *Tenet*.[8] Göransson's score was featured in a trailer for the film on May 8, 2023.[107] It was also featured in the Universal Pictures exclusive five-minute Opening Look on July 13.[108][109] Nolan had advised him to use the violin for Oppenheimer's central theme in the film, with Göransson remarking that he had felt that it could go from \"the most romantic, beautiful tone in a split second to neurotic and heart wrenching, horror sounds\".[67]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Marketing[edit]\n\n\n*Oppenheimer*'s teaser trailer was released on July 28, 2022, featuring a live countdown to 5:29 a.m. (MDT) on July 16, 2023, the 78th anniversary of the first detonation of an atomic weapon; it premiered in screenings of *Nope* before being posted online on Universal's social media profiles.[110] *Empire* commented that it is exemplary of Nolan's style: \"heady, brooding stuff with a real sense of weight\".[111] In December 2022, two trailers for the film premiered in front of *Avatar: The Way of Water*, with one being exclusive to IMAX theaters and the other being shown in all other formats. The latter was eventually released online.[112][113] In May 2023, an official main trailer debuted during preview screenings of *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3*. It was subsequently released to the public on May 8, 2023, alongside a theatrical release poster.[114]\n\n\n\n### Theatrical release[edit]\n\n\n*Oppenheimer* had its world premiere at Le Grand Rex in Paris on July 11, 2023,[115] followed by the British premiere at Odeon Luxe Leicester Square in London on July 13,[116] and the American premiere at AMC Loews Lincoln Square in New York City on July 17.[117] Both the London and the New York premieres were affected by the SAG-AFTRA strike, as some actors left the London premiere early,[116] and Universal Pictures canceled the red carpet event for the New York premiere.[117] SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher later claimed the studios \"duped\" the guild into accepting a twelve-day-extension for negotiations to continue promoting summer films like *Oppenheimer*.[118] *Oppenheimer* was released theatrically on July 21, 2023, by Universal Pictures.[8][119] In addition to standard digital cinemas, it will be also released in various film formats including IMAX 70 mm (30 prints), standard 70 mm (113 prints) and 35 mm (around 80 prints).[120]\n\n\nThe film was released on the same day as *Barbie*, a fantasy comedy film directed by Greta Gerwig based on Mattel's Barbie fashion dolls and media franchise, and distributed by Warner Bros. Many speculated that the decision by Warner Bros. to release *Barbie* on the same day as *Oppenheimer* was made in order to deplete ticket sales of *Oppenheimer* as retaliation for Nolan releasing the film with Universal.[121] Due to the tonal and genre dissonance between the two films, many social media users created memes about how the two films appealed to different audiences,[122] and how they should be viewed as a double feature.[123] The trend was dubbed \"Barbenheimer\",[124] and was labeled as counterprogramming during a summer of \"entertainment industry meltdown\".[125] Cillian Murphy had endorsed the phenomenon, saying \"My advice would be for people to go see both, on the same day. If they are good films, then that's cinema's gain.\"[126]\n\n\nAs of March 2022, Universal Pictures halted the release of its titles in Russia, joining other major American film distributors in the boycott against the country following its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.[127] *Oppenheimer* had also been banned by Russia's Ministry of Culture, which had refused to license screenings of the film, stating that it did not meet their goals of \"preserving and strengthening traditional Russian spiritual values\".[128]\n\n\nIn Japan, the only country to have been attacked by nuclear bombs, the film is yet to have a release date. In late June 2023, a Universal Pictures spokesperson told *Variety* that \"plans have not been finalized in all markets\". *Variety* also pointed out that it is not uncommon for American films to be released in Japan months after the theatrical debut in the United States.[129]\n\n\n\n#### Classifications and censorship[edit]\n\n\nIn the United States, the film received an R-rating from the Motion Picture Association for \"some sexuality, nudity, and language\", meaning anyone under 17 needs to be accompanied by an adult guardian. It is Nolan's first film to receive that rating since *Insomnia* (2002).[130] In Australia, the film received an MA 15+ rating from the Australian Classification Board board for \"strong sex and a suicide scene\".[131] In the United Kingdom, the film received a 15 certificate from the British Board of Film Classification for \"strong language and sex\", meaning anyone under the age of 15 cannot be admitted to view the film.[132] In some countries, including those in the Middle East, South Asia and Southeast Asia, Universal distributed a version of the film with Florence Pugh's nude body covered by a computer-generated black dress.[133][134][135]\n\n\nIn India, *Oppenheimer* was released with all scenes depicting nudity, sex and cigarette smoking being censored, earning the U/A certificate from the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) while retaining the running time.[136] The audio of the scene in which Tatlock directs Oppenheimer to read a verse from the Hindu scripture Bhagavad Gita, \"I am become Death, destroyer of worlds\", while the two have intercourse, remained intact.[137] As NDTV reported, the Minister for Information and Broadcasting Anurag Thakur questioned how the CBFC certified the film with the verse heard during such circumstance in the first place, and asked the scene to be deleted.[138]\n\n\nThe Hindutva was angered by the scene and demanded its removal.[139] Among them was journalist Uday Mahurkar, who wrote an open letter to Nolan calling the scene a \"direct assault on religious beliefs of a billion tolerant Hindus\", and demanded its removal from all releases of *Oppenheimer* across the world.[137] On the other hand, actor Nitish Bharadwaj, told *The Times of India* that \"The use of this verse in the film should also be understood from Oppenheimer's emotional state of mind. A scientist thinks of his creation 24x7x365 days, irrespective of what he is doing. His mind space is consumed fully of his creation & the physical act is just a natural mechanical act.\"[140]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Oppenheimer* will be released on 4K Blu-ray, regular Blu-ray and DVD formats including digital on November 21, 2023.[141]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\nAs of November 14, 2023[update], *Oppenheimer* has grossed $325.3 million in the United States and Canada and $625.4 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $950.7 million.[3][4] It is the second-highest-grossing R-rated film of all-time, behind *Joker* (2019).[142][143] In September 2023, *Oppenheimer* became the highest-grossing biographical film of all time, surpassing *Bohemian Rhapsody* (2018).[144][145]\n\n\nBy August 2023, *Oppenheimer* had become the highest-grossing film ever to not reach the top spot at the domestic box office, though in its sixth weekend it topped the worldwide box office with a total of $38.12 million, surpassing *Barbie* for the first time.[146] It is also the highest grossing World War II-related film, surpassing *Dunkirk* (2017), also a Nolan film.[147][148][149][150] Additionally, *Oppenheimer* became one of the top five highest-grossing IMAX releases, earning $183 million[151] (approximately 20% of its total gross), over $17 million of which was earned from the 30 screens showing IMAX 70 mm prints.[152] The film was booked to be rereleased in IMAX theatres on November 3, including six IMAX 70mm prints, as these theatres reported selling out during the film’s initial release.[151]\n\n\n\n#### United States and Canada[edit]\n\n\nIn the United States and Canada, *Oppenheimer* was released alongside *Barbie*.[153] The week of their releases, AMC Theatres announced that over 40,000 AMC Stubs members had already pre-booked tickets to both films on the same day.[154] After grossing $33 million on its first day (including $10.5 million from Thursday night previews), it went on to debut to $82.5 million,[155] finishing second behind *Barbie* and marking one of the best opening weekends ever for an R-rated drama. 64% of the audience was male, with 33% being 18–34 years old. The Barbenheimer phenomenon was credited with boosting interest in the film, with a total of 79% of tickets sold over the weekend being for the two films (27% for *Oppenheimer*), a combined total of 18.5 million people.[156] The film's opening weekend was Nolan's best for an original film, being the highest of his filmography outside of the latter two films from *The Dark Knight* trilogy.[157] It achieved the third-highest opening weekend for a biopic film, behind *The Passion of the Christ* (2004) and *American Sniper* (2014).[158] The film made $46.2 million in its second weekend (a drop of 44%), remaining in second behind *Barbie*.[159][160] The film made $28.7 million in its third weekend, finishing third behind *Barbie* and newcomer *Meg 2: The Trench*.[161] On August 16, *Oppenheimer* surpassed *Sing* (2016) to become the highest-grossing film to never reach the number one spot at the box office.[162][163] During its fourth weekend, the film made $18.8 million (a drop of 35%) rising back up to second place.[164] In its fifth and sixth weekends, the film grossed $10.7 million and $9 million (a drop of 43% and 16% respectively), finishing in third and fourth place at the box office and passing $300 million domestically in its sixth weekend.[164]\n\n\n\n#### Other territories[edit]\n\n\nOutside the United States and Canada, the film grossed $98 million in its opening weekend.[165] The following weekend, *Oppenheimer* earned $77.1 million, dropping by just 21% to become Nolan's highest-grossing film in 30 countries, including India, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Turkey.[166] In its third weekend, *Oppenheimer* grossed $52.8 million (a drop of 31%)[167] and $32 million in its fourth weekend.[168] The film continued to hold well in the following weeks, making $32 million and $29.1 million in its fifth and sixth weekends.[169][170] As of September 10, 2023, the highest grossing territories were the United Kingdom ($72 million), Germany ($46.9 million), China ($46.8 million), France ($40.1 million) and Australia ($25.9 million).[171]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe performances of Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. were praised.\n\nThe film received critical acclaim.[a] Critics praised *Oppenheimer* primarily for its screenplay, the performances of the cast (particularly Murphy and Downey), and the visuals;[182][183][184][185] it was frequently cited as one of the best films of Nolan,[186][187][178] and of 2023, although some criticism was aimed towards the writing of the female characters.[182] *Hindustan Times* reported that the film was also hailed as one of the best films of the 21st century.[188] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 93% of 471 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.6/10. The website's consensus reads: \"*Oppenheimer* marks another engrossing achievement from Christopher Nolan that benefits from Murphy's tour-de-force performance and stunning visuals.\"[189] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 88 out of 100, based on 69 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[190] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled by PostTrak gave it a 93% overall positive score, with 74% saying they would definitely recommend the film.[156]\n\n\nRichard Roeper of the *Chicago Sun-Times* awarded *Oppenheimer* a perfect four out of four stars, describing it as \"magnificent\" and \"one of the best films of the 21st century\".[191] *The A.V. Club*'s Matthew Jackson deemed it a \"masterpiece\", adding that \"it's Christopher Nolan's best film so far, a step up to a new level for one of our finest filmmakers, and a movie that burns itself into your brain\".[192] *Empire*'s Dan Jolin labeled it a \"masterfully constructed character study\", taking particular note of Murphy's performance and van Hoytema's IMAX cinematography.[193] Peter Suderman writing for *Reason* magazine said that the film leaves the viewer with a sense of \"fear and foreboding about the horror of full-on nuclear conflict in the wake of the nuclear bomb. Humanity is both great *and* terrible. *Oppenheimer* isn't just a movie—it's a warning.\"[194]\n\n\nMatt Zoller Seitz, writing for *RogerEbert.com* gave *Oppenheimer* a full four stars rating. He lauded Nolan's storytelling, exploration of Oppenheimer's character, and the film's technical achievements, concluding: \"As a physical experience, *Oppenheimer* is something else entirely—it's hard to say exactly what, and that's what's so fascinating about it\".[195] Peter Travers described the film as a \"monumental achievement\" and \"one of the best films you'll see anywhere\".[196] Caryn James of BBC Culture similarly termed it \"boldly imaginative and [Nolan's] most mature work yet\", adding that it combined the \"explosive, commercially-enticing action of *The Dark Knight* trilogy\" with the \"cerebral underpinnings\" of *Memento*, *Inception* and *Tenet*.[197] *IGN* critic Siddhant Adlakha gave *Oppenheimer* 10/10, describing it as \"a three-hour biopic that plays like a jolting thriller\" and Nolan's most \"abstract\" work yet.[198]\n\n\nSaibal Chatterjee from NDTV rated the film 4.5 stars out of 5 and stated: \"*Oppenheimer*, a cinematic achievement of blinding brilliance, achieves a sublime combination of visual grandeur, technical flair, emotional intimacy and an examination of the limits of human endeavor and ambition\".[199] In August 2023, it ranked number 3 on *Collider*'s list of \"The 20 Best Drama Movies of the 2020s So Far,\" writing that Nolan \"explores the world's obsession with destructive nuclear weapons from the perspective of their creator; using the Greek myth of Dante [*sic*] as an inspiration, *Oppenheimer* makes it clear that once this type of power is unleashed, it is bound to be used again.\"[200]\n\n\nDespite praising the film's themes and performances, CNN's Brian Lowry believed that \"Nolan juggles a lot, in a way that somewhat works to the movie's detriment\".[201] While acknowledging the contribution of \"American scientists and American enterprise\", Brett Mason noted that the film omits the crucial contributions of non-Americans that ensured the work was able to commence as early as December 1941: \"Nolan completely ignores the crucial role that British science and Australian physicist Mark Oliphant played in jump-starting the quest.\"[202] Writing for the *Los Angeles Times*, Justin Chang staunchly defended Nolan's accurate depiction of how Oppenheimer could not see the true victims of his work. Chang wrote that instead of satisfying \"representational completists\" by detouring to Hiroshima and Nagasaki, \"Nolan treats them instead as a profound absence, an indictment by silence\".[203]\n\n\n\n#### Accuracy and omissions[edit]\n\n\nThe film was noted for its accuracy, with some scenes being taken word-for-word out of the book or real life events.[204] Many of the changes are small embellishments or changes from real life. For example, Oppenheimer was not as excited about his discovery of black holes as shown in the film, since he did not know how significant it would become; the study was indeed released on the same day Germany invaded Poland, as shown in the film. During the Trinity test, Donald Hornig had his hand on the kill switch for a faster reaction time, not near it as depicted in the film. Truman did call Oppenheimer a \"crybaby\", but in a letter to Dean Acheson one year later, not immediately after meeting Oppenheimer.[204][205]\n\n\nThe scene where Oppenheimer poisons his professor's apple is based on accounts that Oppenheimer gave of the incident, but it is unclear whether it occurred in real life.[206] In the film, Oppenheimer is depicted as putting potassium cyanide in the apple before having a change of heart the next day, and then narrowly preventing the apple from being eaten. There is no evidence that Niels Bohr nearly ate the apple, or had any involvement in the incident.[204] Oppenheimer and Einstein were friends,[207] but the specific conversations which the film revolves around never happened.[204] Oppenheimer took his concerns about an unstoppable chain reaction to Arthur Compton, not Einstein.[204]\n\n\nIn addition to their interpersonal conflicts, Strauss had another reason to undermine Oppenheimer's credibility by revoking his security clearance: Oppenheimer was opposed to further development of the hydrogen bomb by the United States. Scott Sagan describes the loss of Oppenheimer's influence to constrain the nuclear arms race between the U.S. and the Soviet Union as a \"broader tragedy\" less clearly depicted in the film than the scientist's personal tragedy, but he called the production highly accurate otherwise for a \"Hollywood movie\".[208] Many efforts undertaken at other Manhattan Project sites, such as Hanford, Washington and Oak Ridge, Tennessee were not shown.[205] Most of them, overseen by General Leslie Groves, focused on producing the nuclear explosives.[209] In addition to the team at Los Alamos, those working at other Project sites, particularly the University of Chicago's Metallurgical Laboratory, also expressed concerns about using the atomic bomb against Japan.[210]\n\n\n\n#### Influence[edit]\n\n\nThe renewed attention to the site and associated nuclear testing encouraged the United States Congress to revise the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (1990), which provided compensation programs for people affected by radiation and nuclear testing during the Cold War, known as \"Downwinders\" and primarily consisting of the Navajo Nation. The United States Senate approved amendments to accommodate additional services to people in New Mexico, but it has not passed US Congress as the House of Representatives had not yet debated its inclusion as part of the national defense bill for the 2024 Fiscal Year.[211]\n\n\n\n#### Accolades[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Award\n | Date of ceremony\n | Category\n | Nominee(s)\n | Result\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Golden Trailer Awards | June 29, 2023\n | Best Drama\n | \"Secrets\" (Trailer Park, Inc.)\n | Won\n | [212][213] |\n| Best Summer 2023 Blockbuster Trailer\n | Won\n |\n| Best Sound Editing\n | Won\n |\n| Best Thriller\n | \"Lightmaker\" (Inside Job)\n | Nominated\n |\n| Best Drama TV Spot (for a Feature FIlm)\n | \"Charge\" (Inside Job)\n | Nominated\n |\n| Best Thriller TV Spot (for a Feature Film)\n | Nominated\n |\n| Best Sound Editing in a TV Spot (for a Feature Film)\n | Nominated\n |\n| Hollywood Critics Association Midseason Film Awards | June 30, 2023 | Most Anticipated Film\n | *Oppenheimer* | Runner-up\n | [214] |\n| Hollywood Music in Media Awards | November 15, 2023 | Best Original Score — Feature Film | Ludwig Göransson | Nominated\n | [215] |\n| Grammy Awards | February 4, 2024 | Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media | Pending\n | [216] |\n| Best Arrangement, Instrumental or A Cappella | Ludwig Göransson (for \"Can You Hear the Music\") | Pending\n |\n| Best Instrumental Composition | Pending\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of films about nuclear issues\n* List of World War II films since 1990\n* *Oppenheimer*, a 1980 TV series about Oppenheimer, portrayed by Sam Waterston\n* *Fat Man and Little Boy*, a 1989 film about the Manhattan Project\n* *Doctor Atomic*, a 2005 opera about Oppenheimer, composed by John Adams\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[172][173][174][175][176][177][178][179][180][181]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"*Oppenheimer* (15)\".

A co-production between the United Kingdom and the United States, it stars John David Washington, Robert Pattinson, Elizabeth Debicki, Dimple Kapadia, Michael Caine, and Kenneth Branagh. The film follows a former CIA agent who is recruited into a secret organization, tasked with tracing the origin of objects that are traveling backwards through time and their connection to an attack from the future to the present. Nolan continued his relationship with Warner Bros. and his production company Syncopy for the film's production and distribution.\n\n\nNolan took over five years to write the screenplay after deliberating about *Tenet*'s central ideas for more than a decade. Pre-production began in late 2018, casting took place in March 2019, and principal photography lasted six months, from May to November, in Denmark, Estonia, India, Italy, Norway, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema shot on 65 mm film and IMAX. After being delayed three times because of the COVID-19 pandemic, *Tenet* was released in the United Kingdom on August 26, 2020, and in the United States on September 3, 2020, in IMAX, 35 mm, and 70 mm.\n\n\nIt was the first Hollywood tent-pole to open in theaters during the pandemic and grossed $365 million worldwide against a $200 million budget, making it the fifth-highest-grossing film of 2020 despite struggling to break-even. The film divided critics but was nominated in two categories at the 93rd Academy Awards, winning Best Visual Effects. *Tenet* also received other accolades including Best Special Visual Effects at the 74th British Academy Film Awards.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nOn a date referred to as \"the 14th\", the Protagonist leads a covert CIA extraction during a staged terrorist siege at an Opera House in Kyiv. He is saved from KORD forces by an unknown operative wearing a red trinket. The Protagonist retrieves an artifact but his team is captured and tortured. He swallows a suicide pill but wakes up to find it was a fake; a test that only he has passed. He is recruited by \"Tenet\", a secretive organization who briefs him on objects with \"inverted\" entropy that move backwards through time. With his handler Neil, he traces them to Priya Singh, an arms dealer in Mumbai.\n\n\nPriya reveals that she is also a member of Tenet and the man who inverted her bullets, Russian oligarch Andrei Sator, is communicating with the future. Sator's estranged wife Kat Barton is an art appraiser who authenticated a forged Goya by her friend Arepo, which Sator purchased to blackmail her. To get Kat's help, the Protagonist and Neil try to steal the Goya from Sator's freeport facility at Oslo Airport but are thwarted by two masked men who emerge from either side of a machine. In Mumbai, Priya explains it was a \"turnstile\", a device that inverts entropy – the two men were the same person, traveling in opposite directions in time. She reveals that Sator sabotaged his Kyiv CIA team but KORD got the artifact, which is plutonium-241.\n\n\nUnaware of his failure to steal the Goya, Kat introduces the Protagonist to Sator in Italy, who plans to kill him until he mentions Kyiv. When he saves Sator's life after Kat tries to drown him, they cooperate to intercept the plutonium. The Protagonist and Neil steal the artifact in Tallinn but are ambushed by an inverted Sator holding Kat hostage. The Protagonist hides the artifact and rescues Kat. However, they are recaptured and taken to another freeport in Tallinn, where the inverted Sator interrogates them for the location of the artifact, eventually shooting Kat with an inverted bullet. Tenet troops led by Commander Ives arrive, but Sator escapes via a turnstile. To save Kat's life, they all invert themselves. The inverted Protagonist drives back to the ambush to retrieve the artifact but encounters Sator, who takes it.\n\n\nTo un-invert, the Protagonist travels back in time to the freeport in Oslo, fights his past self, and enters the turnstile, followed by Neil and a healing Kat. In Oslo, Priya tells him Sator now has all nine pieces of the \"Algorithm\", a device that future antagonists need to invert the entropy of the world and destroy its past. She planned for Sator to get the artifact so as to reveal the other eight pieces in preparing his dead drop. Recalling an earlier conversation with Sir Michael Crosby, the Protagonist realizes it is a nuclear hypocenter detonated on \"the 14th\" in Sator's hometown of Stalsk-12.\n\n\nOn a Tenet ship traveling back to \"the 14th\", Kat reveals Sator has terminal cancer and is omnicidal. He will return to a happy moment on a family vacation in Vietnam that was also on \"the 14th\" and commit suicide, sending the dead drop coordinates to the future via a dead man's switch. Arriving at \"the 14th\", Kat poses as her past self in Vietnam to keep Sator alive until the Tenet forces in Stalsk-12 recover the Algorithm. They use a \"temporal pincer movement\", with both non-inverted and inverted troops making a diversionary attack so the Protagonist and Ives can steal the Algorithm before detonation. One of Sator's men, Volkov, traps them in the hypocenter. Calling from Vietnam, Sator explains the antagonists are trying to escape the effects of climate change.\n\n\nAn inverted soldier with a red trinket sacrifices himself, enabling the Protagonist and Ives to escape with the Algorithm just as the hypocenter detonates, and as Kat kills Sator. As they break up the Algorithm to hide it, the Protagonist sees the red trinket on Neil's bag. Neil reveals he was recruited in his past by a future Protagonist, and they have known each other for a long time. He must now return to the recent timeline in which an inverted Neil dies. Later, Priya plans to kill Kat, given her knowledge. Realizing that he created Tenet, the Protagonist kills Priya first, watching Kat leave with her son.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n* John David Washington as the \"Protagonist\", a CIA operative, later revealed as the founder of Tenet[3][4]\n* Robert Pattinson as Neil, the Protagonist's handler, later revealed as a long-term associate of the Protagonist.[4]\n* Elizabeth Debicki as Katherine \"Kat\" Barton, niece of Sir Fredrick Barton, art appraiser, and Sator's estranged wife[4][5]\n* Dimple Kapadia as Priya Singh,[4] an Indian arms trafficker, and also a member of Tenet.[6]\n* Michael Caine as Sir Michael Crosby, a British intelligence officer, and contact of Priya Singh, who saw a detonation in Stalsk-12 on the 14th[7]\n* Kenneth Branagh as Andrei Sator,[8] a British-domiciled Russian oligarch from the fictional Soviet-era closed city of Stalsk-12, who is communicating with the future[9][10]\n* Martin Donovan as Fay, the Protagonist's CIA boss[6]\n* Fiona Dourif as Wheeler, leader of the Tenet Blue Team[11]\n* Yuri Kolokolnikov as Volkov, Sator's bodyguard[12]\n* Himesh Patel as Mahir,[13] a fixer hired by Neil[11]\n* Clémence Poésy as Barbara,[14][15] a Tenet scientist[4]\n* Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Ives,[16] a Tenet military commander who rescues the Protagonist, Neil and Kat in Tallinn[17]\n\nAlso appearing are Jefferson Hall, the \"Well-Dressed Man\", who the Protagonist tries to rescue (with the artifact) at the fictional Kyiv opera house; Andrew Howard as [Kyiv] Driver, who sabotages the CIA's Kyiv operation and tortures the Protagonist; Wes Chatham as SWAT 3, a member of the Protagonist's covert CIA team in Kyiv; Denzil Smith as Sanjay Singh, Priya's husband;[18] Jeremy Theobald as the steward at Sir Michael Crosby's club; Laurie Shepherd as Max, Kat and Sator's only son; Jack Cutmore-Scott as Klaus, an employee at Sator's Rotas freeport in Oslo; and Sean Avery as the lead soldier on the Red Team.\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Writing and pre-production[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Writer, director and co-producer Christopher Nolan\nWriter and director Christopher Nolan conceived the ideas behind *Tenet* over the course of twenty years,[19] but began working on the script in 2014.[20] The title, as well as being a palindrome, is an allusion to the Sator Square.[21][22] Inspired by a feeling about how he imagined Sergio Leone made *Once Upon a Time in the West* (1968),[19] Nolan tried not to watch any spy movies that might influence him while making *Tenet*, instead relying on his memories of the films.[23]\n\n\nThe science-fiction aspect of the film revolves around the ability to reverse the entropy of things and people, resulting in time reversibility.[24] While the film does refer to real concepts from physics, among them annihilation,[25][26] the second law of thermodynamics, Maxwell's demon, the grandfather paradox, and Feynman and Wheeler's Absorber Theory, Nolan stated in the film's press notes that \"we're not going to make any case for this being scientifically accurate\".[24] Commenting on the scientific aspects of writing the script, he stated: \"I think the scientific method is the best tool we have for analyzing and understanding the world around us ... I've been very inspired by working with great scientists like Kip Thorne, who I worked with on *Interstellar*, who also helped me out with some early analysis of the ideas I wanted to explore to do with time and quantum physics on *Tenet*, although I promised him I wasn't going to bandy his name around as if there was some kind of scientific reality to *Tenet*. It's a very different kettle of fish to *Interstellar*.\"[27]\n\n\nFor both the production and the distribution of the film, which had an estimated budget of $200 million, Nolan continued his relationship with Warner Bros. and his production company Syncopy.[28] Nolan and production designer Nathan Crowley traveled to scout for locations in February and April 2019.[*citation needed*] Disappointed with the Royal Swedish Opera as a potential stand-in for the Kyiv Opera House,[*citation needed*] Crowley instead chose the Linnahall, which fit his affinity for Brutalist architecture.[29] The production decided to film at the National Liberal Club after management at Sotheby's refused to participate, at Cannon Hall after Thornhill Primary School in Islington and Channing School were deemed unsatisfactory, and at Shree Vardhan Tower after it was determined that security at the Antilia was too high to film there.[30]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe film's cast includes John David Washington, Robert Pattinson, Elizabeth Debicki, Dimple Kapadia, Michael Caine and Kenneth Branagh.\n\nWashington, Pattinson, and Debicki were cast in March 2019.[31][32] Each of them were only permitted to read the screenplay while locked in a room.[9][19][33] Nolan chose Washington based on his performance in *BlacKkKlansman* (2018).[34] Washington kept diaries in which he expanded the Protagonist's backstory.[35] Pattinson took some of Neil's mannerisms from political journalist and author Christopher Hitchens.[36] Kat was originally going to be an older woman, but Debicki's appearance in *Widows* (2018) convinced the filmmakers otherwise.[4]\n\n\nThe casting of Dimple Kapadia, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Clémence Poésy, Michael Caine, and Kenneth Branagh was announced as filming started.[37] Kapadia's screen test was put together by director Homi Adajania while working on his 2020 film *Angrezi Medium*.[38] Caine was only given the pages from the script that included what was filmed on his one day of work.[39] Branagh rescheduled production on his own directorial venture *Death on the Nile* (2022) to take his part, claiming to have studied the manuscript more times than any other in his career.[40] Himesh Patel joined the production in August.[41] Martin Donovan's inclusion was revealed in the first trailer for the film.[42]\n\n\n\n### Design and special effects[edit]\n\n\nSpecial effects supervisor Scott R. Fisher watched World War II films and documentaries to find reference points for the film that were based in reality.[43] Prop prototypes were often 3D printed. Costume designer Jeffrey Kurland and his team cut and stitched the clothing for the film in the United States, manufacturing it for the main cast and thousands of extras.[44] Production designer Nathan Crowley ordered around thirty military wristwatches from Hamilton Watch Company, each analog with a digital countdown.[45]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\nTallinn locations featured in the film\n![](image)\nLinnahall, the location for the fictional Kyiv Opera House\n![](image)\nThe Kumu museum, the location for the fictional Oslo freeport\n\nPrincipal photography, involving a crew that Pattinson estimated at 500 people,[36] began on May 22, 2019,[37][46] in a soundstage in Los Angeles,[47] and eventually incorporated seven countries[46]—Denmark, Estonia,[nb 1] India,[nb 2] Italy, Norway, the United Kingdom, and the United States.[50][nb 3] Filming in Estonia took place in June and July, with the Linnahall, Pärnu Highway (E67), and adjacent streets closed to facilitate the production.[51][52] Kumu Art Museum doubled as the fictional Oslo Freeport.[53] Barbara's office was built in a former law court, the Tallinn Freeport exterior was at the city docks, and a room at the Hilton Tallinn Park Hotel was also utilized.[54] Mayor of Tallinn Mihhail Kõlvart expressed concerns about potential disruptions, as the shooting schedule required that the arterial Laagna Road be closed for one month.[55] A compromise was eventually reached, involving temporary road closures and detours.[56][57]\n\n\nScenes were shot on the Amalfi Coast (Italy) and at Cannon Hall (United Kingdom) from July to August,[58][59] and on the roof of the Oslo Opera House, at The Thief hotel (Norway), and in Rødbyhavn at Nysted Wind Farm (Denmark) in early September.[53][60][61] A five-day shoot occurred later that month in Mumbai,[50] specifically at Breach Candy Hospital, Cafe Mondegar, Colaba Causeway, Colaba Market, Gateway of India, Grant Road, Royal Bombay Yacht Club, and the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel.[62][63][64][65] A restaurant named \"Chaand\" was erected near the hotel,[63] but was never used, serving only as an unneeded alternate location.[50] Forty boats were positioned at the Gateway of India, where the crew rescued a man who had attempted suicide.[66]\n\n\n\nEagle Mountain locations featured in the film as Stalsk-12\n![](image)\n![](image)\n\nProduction proceeded in Los Angeles, where Hawthorne Plaza Shopping Center functioned as the interior set of an icebreaker and a shipping container.[67] The Victorville Airport was disguised as Oslo, with more than ninety extras involved.[19] Instead of using miniatures and visual effects (VFX) for the plane crash sequence, Nolan determined that purchasing a Boeing 747 proved more cost-effective.[68] In October, filming moved to Eagle Mountain, where an abandoned town had been constructed and hundreds were clothed in military camouflage uniforms.[9] Over thirty buildings were prefabricated in Los Angeles and shipped to the site. Four Boeing CH-47 Chinooks were loaned out for four days.[*citation needed*] Outside shots of a tunnel were done in the desert, while the cavernous insides of the Hypocenter were fashioned on Warner Soundstage 16, their largest, with 32,130 square feet.[69] *Tenet* wrapped on November 12, after 96 days of shooting.[70]\n\n\nDirector of photography Hoyte van Hoytema employed a combination of 65 mm film[*citation needed*] and IMAX,[71] prioritizing Panavision lenses that would best accommodate lower light.[43] Segments of the film that concerned time inversion were captured in both backward- and forward-mobility and speech.[72][73] To ensure proficiency in handling firearms, Washington and Pattinson attended the Taran Tactical firing range in Simi Valley. They did some of their own stunts. Over one hundred watercraft were recruited for the film, including two F50 catamarans,[*citation needed*] the superyacht *Planet Nine* (onto which an Mi-8 helicopter landed), an icebreaker, a cargo tanker, fishing boats, and speedboats.[74] The windfarm vessel *Iceni Revenge* was utilized for the three months spent filming in Denmark, Estonia, and Italy.[75][9]\n\n\n\n### Post-production[edit]\n\n\nDuring filming, sound designer Richard King sent a team to Eagle Mountain to record the Chinooks and Mi-8, and to Southampton to record the F50 catamarans.[76] Others were hired to capture the aural atmosphere of Oslo, Mumbai, and Tallinn.[76] King got audio of both live and blank automatic weapon rounds at a gun range in San Francisquito Canyon and rented a runway to test how the vehicles in the film sound.[77]\n\n\nJennifer Lame replaced Nolan's long-time editor Lee Smith, who was occupied with 2019's *1917*.[78] Visual effects supervisor Andy Lockley said the film's VFX shots involved the participation of 300 employees at DNEG.[19][79]\n\n\n\n## Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tenet (soundtrack)\n\nLudwig Göransson was chosen to compose the film's music after Nolan's frequent collaborator and first choice, Hans Zimmer, turned down the offer in favor of the 2021 film *Dune*.[80][81]\n\n\nResearching retrograde composition led Göransson to generate melodies that would sound the same forward and backward. He experimented with distorted industrial noise and, to represent Sator's irradiated breathing, asked Nolan to tape his own breath in a studio. Göransson produced ten to fifteen minutes of music each week. The first scoring session was held in November 2019, and sessions continued into early 2020.[82]\n\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Göransson recorded musicians at their homes.[9] The *Tenet* soundtrack contains \"The Plan\", a song by Travis Scott,[83] which plays over the film's closing credits.[84]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2019, Warner Bros. debuted a forty-second teaser ahead of *Hobbs & Shaw* previews,[85] which was published online in December.[86] Yohana Desta of *Vanity Fair* called it an \"old-school surprise\" and praised Göransson's score,[87] while Jim Vejvoda of *IGN* described it as \"*Inception* with time travel\".[88] Both Vejvoda and *IndieWire*'s Zack Sharf noted the trailer's stylization of the film's title as *TENƎꓕ* to emphasize the palindromic nature.[88][89] The film's prolog also played in select IMAX theaters before screenings of *Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker*,[86] which Kyle Kizu of *The Hollywood Reporter* favorably compared to the prolog of Nolan's other films.[90] The film's logo was altered in May 2020 to remove the inverted stylization due to its similarity with that of a bicycle components manufacturer.[91] The final trailer was released in August and featured Scott's single.[92] A making-of video was released on August 26.[12]\n\n\nThe marketing and promotion of the film was significantly hampered due to postponements caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, with executives calculating that each postponement cost Warner Bros. between $200,000 and $400,000 in marketing fees.[93] Eventually, after briefly being held up indefinitely,[94] Glenn Whipp of the *Los Angeles Times* noted that Warner Bros. did not put *Tenet* on the Academy's streaming platform or send out screeners to awards voters.[95] Given the large investment in the film, part of its marketing campaign involved dual promotions with the watch manufacturer Hamilton and *Fortnite*, both of whom assisted in increasing public awareness of the forthcoming film. Hamilton featured Washington wearing the watch and endorsing it in multiple ad campaigns, while *Fortnite* developer Epic Games worked on the pre-release trailer for the film and created an interview with Washington which was featured on multiple video game websites.[96]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\nWarner Bros. originally scheduled *Tenet* for a July 17, 2020, release in IMAX, 35 mm, and 70 mm film.[97] Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was delayed to July 31,[98][99] and then August 12.[100] The studio finally arranged for the film to be released in seventy countries, with a run time of 150 minutes, on August 26,[101][102][103] following preview screenings in Australia and South Korea on August 22 and 23.[104][105] The film opened in select cities in the United States on September 3, gradually expanding in the ensuing weeks.[101] On September 4, it was released in China.[106] *Tenet* was the first Hollywood tent-pole to launch in theaters following their prolonged shutdown.[107] The lack of available movies afforded it more screens per multiplex than would otherwise have been possible.[108]\n\n\nOn March 2, 2021, Warner Bros. announced that, in light of the New York state government allowing film theaters in New York City to re-open on Friday, March 5, following a nearly year-long shutdown (causing theaters in the city to miss out on the film's initial theatrical run), they would be re-releasing *Tenet* at select theaters in the city.[109]\n\n\nIn the Philippines, the film was released on HBO Go streaming platform on June 12, 2021, following the year-long indefinite closure of theaters in the country in response of a potential COVID-19 surge, becoming the last major Asian country to do so.[110]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\nThe film was released on 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray, DVD, and digital download on December 15, 2020.[111] It was added to HBO Max on May 1, 2021.[112]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n*Tenet* grossed $58.5 million in the United States and Canada and $306.8 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $363.7 million.[2][1] With a production budget of $200 million,[113] it is Nolan's most expensive original project.[114] IndieWire speculated that marketing costs pushed the final sum to $300–350 million,[115] though some analysts predicted it would incur lower advertising costs than usual, owing to inexpensive live sports ads.[116] Box office analyst Jeff Bock estimated the film would need to make $400–500 million to break even.[117] In November 2020, rival studios expected the film to lose up to $100 million, but Warner Bros. insisted losses would not top $50 million.[118] Nolan reportedly received twenty percent of the film's first-dollar gross.[119]\n\n\nThe film was projected to make $25–30 million internationally over its first five days.[120] In South Korea, pre-sale IMAX tickets sold out, and weekend previews earned $717,000 from 590 venues.[105] Another four days in the country yielded $4.13 million from about 2,200 screens, bringing the cume to $5.1 million by the end of the week. *Tenet* debuted to $53 million in forty-one countries, grossing $7.1 million in the United Kingdom, $6.7 million in France, and $4.2 million in Germany.[28][121][122] It made $58.1 million its second weekend, with China ($30 million from first showings), the UK ($13.1 million), France ($10.7 million), Germany ($8.7 million), and South Korea ($8.2 million) as the largest markets.[123] It made $30.6 million its third weekend, earning $16.4 million in the UK, $13.2 million in France, $11.4 million in Germany, $10.3 million in South Korea, and $10.2 million in China.[124] The film earned $11.4 million in its first two weeks in Japan,[125] and, after opening in India on December 4, 2020,[126] made about $1.2 million in its first ten days in the country.[127] In Estonia, *Tenet* became the highest-grossing film of all time, with a total gross of $1.2 million.[128]\n\n\nIn the United States and Canada, with 65% of theaters operating at 25–40% capacity, the film earned $20.2 million from 2,810 theaters in its first eleven days of release: $12 million in the U.S., $2.5 million in Canada, and the rest from previews.[122][129] The second, third, and fourth weekends added $6.6 million, $4.6 million, and $3.3 million, respectively.[130][131][132] *Tenet* remained atop the American box office its fifth weekend with $2.7 million,[133] before ceding the number one spot to *The War with Grandpa* its sixth weekend.[134]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n*Tenet* divided critics, with *USA Today*'s Jenna Ryu and the *Los Angeles Times*'s Christi Carras respectively describing the reviews as \"mixed\" and \"all over the place\".[135][136] *The Independent*'s Clémence Michallon wrote that the film was perceived as \"both entertaining and 'cerebral' by some, but lacking and confusing by others\".[137] Ellise Shafer of *Variety* found that, while some were weary of the film's \"metaphysical babble\", reviews were \"largely positive\", with critics overall naming it \"a mind-blowing addition to Nolan's already-impressive arsenal\".[138] On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 69% of 375 critics gave *Tenet* a positive review, with an average rating of 6.9/10; the website's critical consensus reads: \"A visually dazzling puzzle for film lovers to unlock, *Tenet* serves up all the cerebral spectacle audiences expect from a Christopher Nolan production.\"[139] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 69 out of 100 based on 50 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[140] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale,[141] and PostTrak reported that 80% of those gave the film a positive score, with 65% saying they would recommend it.[142]\n\n\nGuy Lodge of *Variety* described *Tenet* as a \"grandly entertaining, time-slipping spectacle\".[4] *The Guardian* critic Peter Bradshaw felt it was both \"madly preposterous\" and \"amazing cinema\".[143] Kevin Maher of *The Times* awarded the film a full five stars, deeming it \"a delightfully convoluted masterpiece\".[144] Robbie Collin of *The Telegraph* likened it to Nolan's *Inception* and praised the \"depth, subtlety and wit of Pattinson and Debicki's performances\".[8] In his review for *Rolling Stone*, Peter Travers described the film as \"pure, ravishing cinema\" and called Washington a \"star-in-the-making\" who \"brings a natural athletic grace to the stunts and hand-to-hand combat\".[145] *The Dispatch*'s Alec Dent found *Tenet* to have \"a gloriously innovative storyline with incredible visuals to match\".[146] Mark Daniell of the *Toronto Sun* gave the film four out of four stars, deeming it \"the cinematic equivalent of a Rubik's Cube\".[147] Richard Roeper of the *Chicago Sun-Times* gave it three and a half out of four stars, praising Debicki's \"mesmerizing\" portrayal and concluding that \"it's the kind of film that reminds us of the magic of the moviegoing experience\", despite not reaching \"cinematic greatness\".[148] Keith Phillips of *The Ringer* wrote that *Tenet* has the makings of a cult film, with \"a failed release due to the pandemic, a muted critical reception, and a twisty narrative that demands multiple viewings\".[149] Director Denis Villeneuve called the film \"a masterpiece\" and \"an incredible cinematic achievement\".[150]\n\n\nJames Berardinelli noted that the film \"may be the most challenging of Nolan's films to date\" in terms of \"the concepts forming the narrative's foundation: backwards-moving entropy, non-linear thinking, temporal paradoxes\", but questioned whether its runtime \"might prove to be problematic\".[151] He named it the best film of 2020.[152] Leslie Felperin of *The Hollywood Reporter* felt that Washington was \"dashing but a little dull\" and that Debicki's performance \"adds a color to Nolan's palette, and [she] has persuasive chemistry with Branagh in their joint portrait of a violent, dysfunctional love-hate relationship\". She concluded that *Tenet* is \"rich in audacity and originality\", but lacks \"a certain humanity\".[15] Jessica Kiang of *The New York Times* described the film as Nolan's \"time-bending\" take on James Bond, praising the film's cinematography, score, editing, acting, and \"immaculately creaseless costumes\", while also deeming it a \"hugely expensive, blissfully empty spectacle\".[153] *LA Weekly*'s Asher Luberto also highlighted the similarities between *Tenet* and the James Bond films, but also felt it was \"a daring, surprising and entirely original piece of work, reverent in its spectacle and haunting in its mesmerizing, dreamlike form\".[154] Branagh's character was described by some critics as a stereotypical Russian villain.[155][156] Christina Newland of *Vulture.com* called Branagh \"silly-accented ... as a Bond-villain-esque Russian mastermind\".[157]\n\n\nMike McCahill of IndieWire gave the film a \"C−\" grade and called it \"a humorless disappointment\".[158] Michael Phillips of the *Chicago Tribune* awarded it two out of four stars, writing that he wished the film \"exploited its own ideas more dynamically\".[159] The *New York Post*'s Johnny Oleksinski also gave it two out of four stars, calling it Nolan's most \"confusing\" work so far, but acknowledged being \"swept up by Nolan's incomparable cinematic vision\".[160] Kathleen Sachs of the *Chicago Reader* gave the film one and a half out of four stars, concluding that Nolan \"doesn't show much growth in his most recent self-indulgent work\".[161] Brian Lloyd of *Entertainment.ie* said poor sound mixing \"often\" rendered dialog inaudible when viewed on 35 mm film, suggesting viewing the film on Digital Cinema Package files to reduce the problem.[162] The *San Francisco Chronicle*'s Mick LaSalle also found *Tenet* \"difficult to understand\", and continued that \"even worse, it inspires little desire to understand it\".[163]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by Tenet\n\n*Tenet* received nominations for Best Production Design and Best Visual Effects at the 93rd Academy Awards, winning the latter.[164] At the 74th British Academy Film Awards, the film won the Best Special Visual Effects award,[165] and also won an award in the same category at the 26th Critics' Choice Awards, out of its five nominations.[166][167] It received a nomination for Best Original Score at the 78th Golden Globe Awards.[168] Other nominations include five Satellite Awards (winning one),[169] nine Saturn Awards (winning one),[170] and one Hugo Award nomination.[171]\n\n\n\n## Themes and analysis[edit]\n\n\n*Tenet*'s complex plot and character timelines, ambiguities and hidden details have been analyzed, leading to various fan theories and interpretations.[172]\n\n\n\n### Palindromes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The first-century Latin Sator Square, which inspired the film's title, as well as two character names (Sator and Arepo, the Goya forger), the location of the opening sequence (Opera), and the name of Sator's security company (Rotas).\n\nPalindromes appear throughout the film in various guises. The five-letter words from the palindromic Sator Square appear as names and locations in the film: \"Sator\" (the Russian oligarch); \"Arepo\" (the art forger); \"Tenet\" (the name of the film and the Protagonist's organization); \"Opera\" (the opening scene takes place at the Kyiv Opera House); and \"Rotas\" (the name of the security company running Oslo Freeport).[173] There is a further nod to the word \"Tenet\" in the film's final battle in which the red and blue teams each have \"ten\" minutes to carry out their non-inverted (\"ten\") and inverted (\"net\") operations in Stalsk-12.[174] When the Protagonist is being tortured, trains pass by in opposite directions. Ludwig Göransson's score includes melodies that sound the same forward and backward. The film itself is a form of \"temporal palindrome\", as it ends at the same time as the events of the beginning of the film were taking place, \"the 14th\".[175]\n\n\n\n### Temporal paradoxes and free will[edit]\n\n\nSeveral characters have complex timelines in the film due to inverting and reverting, notably Neil, the Protagonist, Sator and Kat.[176][175][177] Inversion allows multiple versions of a character to exist simultaneously; for instance, there are five simultaneous Neils (that are known) in the world during the moments of the climactic scene inside the Stalsk-12 hypocenter where he dies (two inverted and one normal on the battlefield, one inverted at the opera siege and one more normal somewhere else in the world who will later meet the Protagonist in Neil's first appearance of the film),[177] and the implication is that an older future Protagonist is orchestrating the events of the film behind the scenes without ever being seen by the viewer or his past self, in an example of a temporal pincer movement.[178] Inversion also sets up bootstrap paradoxes, whereby events are caused by themselves in a \"chicken or the egg\" scenario.[179]\n\n\nFree will is a theme in *Tenet*.[179] There are suggestions that *Tenet*'s universe is deterministic, so what happens (including bootstrap paradoxes) will always happen, and consequently, there is arguably no free will.[179] One of the film's common refrains, \"ignorance is our ammunition\", could hint at the illusionist stance that free will does not exist but people should act as if they have free will.[179] However, the characters (especially Neil) express uncertainty as to whether history can be altered, and say several times during the film, \"what's happened, happened\".[179] Neil's attitude towards free will could be interpreted as compatibilist, whereby free will and determinism are seen as compatible.[179] Kat is seen as the character who most strongly embodies free will in *Tenet* by choosing to stray from the plan and shoot Sator, at which point she is free from his control.[180] Kat relays to the Protagonist that when she was returning with Max to Sator's yacht in Vietnam and saw a woman (her future self, unbeknownst to past Kat) diving gracefully off the yacht, she felt jealous of that woman's freedom.[176] Similarly, there is uncertainty in *Tenet* regarding the grandfather paradox and whether the use of the Algorithm in the future, wiping out the past (the time of the events in *Tenet*), would also wipe out the future.[181]\n\n\n*Tenet* has been interpreted as a war between past and future.[182][176]\n\n\n\n### Scientific accuracy[edit]\n\n\nThe plot revolves around reversing the entropy of things and people, resulting in time reversibility,[24] and the film references physics concepts including the second law of thermodynamics, Maxwell's demon, and Feynman and Wheeler's notion of a one-electron universe; nonetheless, Christopher Nolan stated in the film's press notes: \"we're not going to make any case for this being scientifically accurate\".[24]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Seven weeks of filming in Estonia came at a cost of €16.5 million;[9][48] Warner Bros. Pictures paid a rebate that was reimbursed at thirty percent.[48]\n2. **^** It took one week to secure the permission to shoot in Mumbai.[49] The planned schedule was completed in half the time.[50]\n3. **^** *Tenet* went under the working title *Merry Go Round*.[19][49]\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"*Tenet*\". *The Numbers*.

It stars Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Bill Irwin, Ellen Burstyn, Matt Damon, and Michael Caine. Set in a dystopian future where humanity is embroiled in a catastrophic blight and famine, the film follows a group of astronauts who travel through a wormhole near Saturn in search of a new home for humankind.\n\n\nBrothers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan wrote the screenplay, which had its origins in a script Jonathan developed in 2007 and was originally set to be directed by Steven Spielberg. Kip Thorne, a Caltech theoretical physicist and 2017 Nobel laureate in Physics,[4] was an executive producer, acted as a scientific consultant, and wrote a tie-in book, *The Science of Interstellar*. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema shot it on 35 mm movie film in the Panavision anamorphic format and IMAX 70 mm. Principal photography began in late 2013 and took place in Alberta, Iceland, and Los Angeles. *Interstellar* uses extensive practical and miniature effects, and the company Double Negative created additional digital effects.\n\n\n*Interstellar* premiered in Los Angeles on October 26, 2014. In the United States, it was first released on film stock, expanding to venues using digital projectors. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed over $681 million worldwide ($703 million after subsequent re-releases), making it the tenth-highest-grossing film of 2014. It has been praised by astronomers for its scientific accuracy and portrayal of theoretical astrophysics.[5][6][7] *Interstellar* was nominated for five awards at the 87th Academy Awards, winning Best Visual Effects, and received numerous other accolades.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn 2067, humanity is facing extinction following a global famine caused by ecocide.[8] As a result, ex-NASA pilot, Joseph Cooper, is forced to work as a farmer, with his son Tom, daughter Murph and father-in-law Donald.\n\n\nAfter odd occurrences in her room, Murph arrives at the conclusion that a ghost, trapped in her bookshelf, is trying to communicate the word 'stay' to her. Cooper seeks a scientific explanation for the gravitational anomaly and deduces a pattern that resolves into GPS coordinates. Following the address, he and Murph arrive at a secret NASA facility, headed by Professor Brand. NASA is distrusting of Cooper initially, but Brand enlists Cooper's help for their mission, believing him to have been led there by the same entity - a supernatural, extra-terrestrial \"them\" - who decades ago placed a mysterious wormhole, close to humanity's reach near the planet Saturn. NASA's objective is to follow up on earlier missions through the wormhole and find an exoplanet suited to support human life. Their \"Plan A\" is to eventually transport people off the dying Earth to the other planet (using a yet-to-be-solved gravity equation), failing which, \"Plan B\" would use embryos to start a new extra-terrestrial colony, letting Earth's original population perish. \n\n\nBelieving Plan A will save Murph's generation, Cooper bids farewell to his family and embarks on the mission aboard the spacecraft *Endurance*, along with a crew of three scientists: Romilly, Doyle, and Brand’s daughter Amelia, and two robot assistants TARS and CASE. After reaching their destination, the crew investigates three planets orbiting a supermassive black hole, Gargantua, each previously checked by a NASA scientist-explorer. Romilly remains in orbit to study Gargantua while the others take a Ranger craft to the first planet, an ocean world of shallow water assigned to explorer Laura Miller. Upon arriving at Miller's beacon and finding debris, they realize she was killed by colossal tidal waves generated by Gargantua's gravity. Doyle is swept away by a huge wave, and Cooper and Amelia narrowly escape the next. They return to the *Endurance* after only a couple of hours in their perspective, yet 23 years have passed aboard *Endurance* due to the time dilation caused by Gargantua's gravity. Back on Earth, Murph has become a scientist and begun working with the elder Brand.\n\n\nThe second planet's mission fails as well, as the crew realizes that the planet's explorer, Mann, whom they awaken from cryostasis, had been transmitting false signals about the ice world's habitability so that someone would rescue him. Mann turns on the crew, first attempting to kill Cooper, then hijacking a Ranger so that he can dock with the *Endurance* and take control. Romilly is killed by an explosion planted by Mann at the base, and Mann is himself killed after failing to properly dock in space. Cooper and Amelia approach the damaged *Endurance* in a Lander, and regain control of the spacecraft. On Earth, a dying Brand confesses to Murph that he lied about the viability of Plan A, dooming Earth's population knowingly. He believed that his gravity equation \nwas unsolvable, as it lacked vital information able to be obtained only from inside a black hole's singularity. Murph is distraught that her father left her to die, but resolves to find a solution to Brand's work.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Cooper devises a plan to initiate a slingshot maneuver around Gargantua, propelling the *Endurance* onwards to the third and final planet, assigned to Dr. Wolf Edmunds. To shed extra weight, he sacrifices himself and TARS by detaching from the spacecraft and falling into the black hole, setting up Amelia to safely reach Edmunds' planet. Falling past the event horizon, Cooper finds himself inside a four-dimensional tesseract where time is physically presented. Seeing past moments from Murph's childhood bedroom, he tries to contact her by manipulating items in the room with gravity. Cooper deduces this construct has been created by future humans able to interact with four dimensions - \"them\" - in order for him to send messages he received in the past, such as the word 'stay'. With TARS's help, Cooper relays the information Murph needs to solve the gravity equation in the form of Morse code on her watch. The tesseract closes, and he and TARS are returned to the orbit of Saturn. Cooper is rescued and brought to an O'Neill Cylinder, where he tearfully reunites with an elderly Murph, who has used the gravity equation to accomplish Plan A and enable humanity's exodus from Earth. Nearing death, she advises him to seek out Amelia. Cooper and TARS set off again to reunite with Amelia. On Edmunds' planet, Amelia buries the deceased Edmunds before removing her helmet to breathe.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n![Matthew McConaughey](image)\n![Anne Hathaway](image)\nMatthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway played the protagonists of *Interstellar*.\n\n* Matthew McConaughey as Joseph Cooper,[a] a widowed NASA pilot who, after the agency was closed by the government, became a farmer\n* Anne Hathaway as Dr. Amelia Brand, a NASA scientist, astronaut, and Professor John's daughter\n* Jessica Chastain as Murphy \"Murph\" Cooper, Joseph's daughter, who eventually becomes a NASA scientist\n\t+ Mackenzie Foy as young Murph\n\t+ Ellen Burstyn as elderly Murph\n* Bill Irwin as TARS (voice and puppetry) and CASE (puppetry)\n* Michael Caine as Professor John Brand, a high-ranking NASA scientist, ideator of Plan A, former mentor of Cooper, and father of Amelia\n* John Lithgow as Donald, Cooper's elderly father-in-law\n* David Gyasi as Professor Romilly, a high-ranking NASA member, and *Endurance* crew member\n* Wes Bentley as Doyle, another high-ranking NASA member, and *Endurance* crew member\n* Casey Affleck as Tom Cooper, Joseph's son, who eventually grows up to become a farmer\n\t+ Timothée Chalamet as young Tom\n* Matt Damon as Dr. Mann, a NASA astronaut sent to an icy planet during the Lazarus program\n* Josh Stewart as CASE (voice)\n* Topher Grace as Getty, Murph's colleague and love interest\n* Leah Cairns as Lois, Tom's wife\n* David Oyelowo as School Principal\n* Collette Wolfe as Ms. Hanley\n* William Devane as Williams, another NASA member\n* Elyes Gabel as Administrator\n* Jeff Hephner as Doctor\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Crew[edit]\n\n\n* Christopher Nolan – Director, producer, writer\n* Jonathan Nolan – Writer\n* Emma Thomas – Producer\n* Lynda Obst – Producer\n* Hoyte van Hoytema – Cinematographer\n* Nathan Crowley – Production designer\n* Mary Zophres – Costume designer\n* Lee Smith – Editor\n* Hans Zimmer – Music composer\n* Paul Franklin – Visual effects supervisor\n* Kip Thorne – Consultant, executive producer\n\n### Development and financing[edit]\n\n\nThe premise for *Interstellar* was conceived by the producer Lynda Obst and the theoretical physicist Kip Thorne, who collaborated on the film *Contact* (1997), and had known each other since Carl Sagan set them up on a blind date.[9][10] The two conceived a scenario, based on Thorne's work, about \"the most exotic events in the universe suddenly becoming accessible to humans\", and attracted Steven Spielberg's interest in directing.[11] The film began development in June 2006, when Spielberg and Paramount Pictures announced plans for a science-fiction film based on an eight-page treatment written by Obst and Thorne. Obst was attached to produce.[12][13] By March 2007, Jonathan Nolan was hired to write a screenplay.[14]\n\n\nAfter Spielberg moved his production studio, DreamWorks, from Paramount to Walt Disney Studios in 2009, Paramount needed a new director for *Interstellar*. Jonathan Nolan recommended his brother Christopher, who joined the project in 2012.[15] Christopher Nolan met with Thorne, then attached as executive producer, to discuss the use of spacetime in the story.[16] In January 2013, Paramount and Warner Bros. announced that Christopher Nolan was in negotiations to direct *Interstellar*.[17] Nolan said he wanted to encourage the goal of human spaceflight,[18] and intended to merge his brother's screenplay with his own.[19] By the following March, Nolan was confirmed to direct *Interstellar*, which would be produced under his label Syncopy and Lynda Obst Productions.[20] *The Hollywood Reporter* said Nolan would earn a salary of $20 million against 20% of the total gross.[21] To research for the film, Nolan visited NASA and the private space program at SpaceX.[16]\n\n\nWarner Bros. sought a stake in Nolan's production of *Interstellar* from Paramount, despite their traditional rivalry, and agreed to give Paramount its rights to co-finance the next film in the *Friday the 13th* horror franchise, with a stake in a future film based on the television series *South Park*. Warner Bros. also agreed to let Paramount co-finance an indeterminate \"A-list\" property.[22] In August 2013, Legendary Pictures finalized an agreement with Warner Bros. to finance approximately 25% of the film's production. Although it failed to renew its eight-year production partnership with Warner Bros., Legendary reportedly agreed to forgo financing *Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice* (2016) in exchange for the stake in *Interstellar*.[23]\n\n\n\n### Writing and casting[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Dust Bowl phenomenon of the 1930s, as documented by Ken Burns in *The Dust Bowl* (2012), served as inspiration for the blight.\nJonathan Nolan worked on the script for four years.[9] To learn the scientific aspects, he studied relativity at the California Institute of Technology.[24] He was pessimistic about the Space Shuttle program ending and how NASA lacked financing for a human mission to Mars, drawing inspiration from science-fiction films with apocalyptic themes, such as *WALL-E* (2008) and *Avatar* (2009). Jeff Jensen of *Entertainment Weekly* said: \"He set the story in a dystopian future ravaged by blight, but populated with hardy folk who refuse to bow to despair.\"[15] His brother Christopher had worked on other science fiction scripts but decided to take the *Interstellar* script and choose among the vast array of ideas presented by Jonathan and Thorne. He picked what he felt, as director, he could get \"across to the audience and hopefully not lose them,\" before he merged it with a script he had worked on for years on his own.[16][25] Christopher kept in place Jonathan's conception of the first hour, which is set on a resource depleted Earth in the near future. The setting was inspired by the Dust Bowl that took place in the United States during the Great Depression in the 1930s.[9] He revised the rest of the script, where a team travels into space, instead.[9] After watching the 2012 documentary *The Dust Bowl* for inspiration, Christopher contacted the director, Ken Burns, and the producer, Dayton Duncan. They granted him permission to use some of their featured interviews in *Interstellar*.[26]\n\n\nChristopher Nolan wanted an actor who could bring to life his vision of the main character as an everyman with whom \"the audience could experience the story.\"[27] He became interested in casting Matthew McConaughey after watching him in an early cut of the 2012 film *Mud*,[27] which he had seen as a friend of one of its producers, Aaron Ryder.[9] Nolan went to visit McConaughey while he was filming for the TV series *True Detective*.[28] Anne Hathaway was invited to Nolan's home, where she read the script for *Interstellar*.[29] In early 2013, both actors were cast in the starring roles.[30] Jessica Chastain was contacted while she was working on *Miss Julie* (2014) in Northern Ireland, and a script was delivered to her.[29] Originally, Irrfan Khan was offered the role of Dr. Mann but rejected it due to scheduling conflicts. Matt Damon was cast as Mann in late August 2013 and completed filming his scenes in Iceland.[31]\n\n\n\n### Principal photography[edit]\n\n\nNolan shot *Interstellar* on 35 mm film in the Panavision anamorphic format and IMAX 70 mm photography.[32] Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema was hired for *Interstellar*, as Wally Pfister, Nolan's cinematographer on all of his previous films, was making his directorial debut working on *Transcendence* (2014);[33] Pfister would later retire as a cinematographer for films.[34]\nMore IMAX cameras were used for *Interstellar* than for any of Nolan's previous films. To minimize the use of computer-generated imagery (CGI), Nolan had practical locations built, such as the interior of a space shuttle.[27] Van Hoytema retooled an IMAX camera to be hand-held for shooting interior scenes.[9] Some of the film's sequences were shot with an IMAX camera installed in the nose cone of a Learjet.[35]\nNolan, who is known for keeping details of his productions secret, strove to ensure secrecy for *Interstellar*. Writing for *The Wall Street Journal*, Ben Fritz stated, \"The famously secretive filmmaker has gone to extreme lengths to guard the script to ... *Interstellar*, just as he did with the blockbuster *Dark Knight* trilogy.\"[36] As one security measure, *Interstellar* was filmed under the name *Flora's Letter*,[37] Flora being one of Nolan's four children with producer Emma Thomas.[16]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Svínafellsjökull glacier in Iceland was used as a filming location for *Interstellar*, doubling for Mann's planet.\nThe film's principal photography was scheduled to last four months.[31] It began on August 6, 2013, in the province of Alberta, Canada.[23] Towns in Alberta where shooting took place included Nanton, Longview, Lethbridge, Fort Macleod, and Okotoks. In Okotoks, filming took place at the Seaman Stadium and the Olde Town Plaza.[37] For a cornfield scene, production designer Nathan Crowley planted 500 acres (200 ha) of corn that would be destroyed in an apocalyptic dust storm scene,[15] intended to be similar to storms experienced during the Dust Bowl in 1930s America.[16] Additional scenes involving the dust storm and McConaughey's character were also shot in Fort Macleod, where the giant dust clouds were created on location using large fans to blow cellulose-based synthetic dust through the air.[38] Filming in the province lasted until September 9, 2013, and involved hundreds of extras in addition to 130 crew members, most of whom were local.[37]\n\n\nShooting also took place in Iceland, where Nolan had previously filmed scenes for *Batman Begins* (2005).[39] It was chosen to represent two extraterrestrial planets: one covered in ice, and the other in water.[9] The crew transported mock spaceships weighing about 10,000 pounds (4,500 kg).[16] They spent two weeks shooting there,[31] during which a crew of about 350 people, including 130 locals, worked on the film. Locations included the Svínafellsjökull glacier and the town of Klaustur.[40][41] While filming a water scene in Iceland, Hathaway almost suffered hypothermia because her dry suit had not been properly secured.[16]\n\n\nAfter the schedule in Iceland was completed, the crew shot in Los Angeles for 54 days. Filming locations included the Westin Bonaventure Hotel and Suites, the Los Angeles Convention Center, a Sony Pictures soundstage in Culver City, and a private residence in Altadena, California.[42] Principal photography concluded in December 2013.[43] Production had a budget of $165 million, $10 million less than was allotted by Paramount, Warner Bros., and Legendary Pictures.[16]\n\n\n\n### Production design[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe *Endurance* spacecraft (*left*) is based on the International Space Station (*right*).\n\n*Interstellar* features three spacecraft— the *Endurance*, a ranger, and a lander. The *Endurance*, the crew's mother ship, is a circular structure consisting of 12 capsules, laid flat to mimic a clock: Four capsules with planetary settling equipment, four with engines, and four with the permanent functions of cockpit, medical labs, and habitation. Production designer Nathan Crowley said the *Endurance* was based on the International Space Station: \"It's a real mish-mash of different kinds of technology. You need analog stuff, as well as digital stuff, you need backup systems and tangible switches. It's really like a submarine in space. Every inch of space is used, everything has a purpose.\" The ranger's function is similar to the Space Shuttle's, being able to enter and exit planetary atmospheres. Lastly, the lander transports the capsules with settling equipment to planetary surfaces. Crowley compared it to \"a heavy Russian helicopter.\"[9]\n\n\nThe film features two robots, CASE and TARS, as well as a dismantled third robot, KIPP. Nolan wanted to avoid making the robots anthropomorphic and chose a 1.5 m (4.9 ft) quadrilateral design. He said: \"It has a very complicated design philosophy. It's based on mathematics. You've got four main blocks and they can be joined in three ways. So, you have three combinations you follow. But then within that, it subdivides into a further three joints. And all the places we see lines—those can subdivide further. So you can unfold a finger, essentially, but it's all proportional.\" Bill Irwin voiced and physically controlled both robots, with his image digitally removed, and Josh Stewart replaced his voicing for CASE.[9] The human space habitats resemble O'Neill cylinders, a theoretical space habitat model proposed by physicist Gerard K. O'Neill in 1976.[44]\n\n\n\n### Sound design[edit]\n\n\nGregg Landaker and Gary Rizzo were the film's audio engineers tasked with audio mixing, while sound editor Richard King supervised the process.[45] Christopher Nolan sought to mix the sound to take maximum advantage of theater equipment[46] and paid close attention to designing the sound mix, like focusing on the sound of buttons being pressed with astronaut suit gloves.[15] The studio's website stated that the film was \"mixed to maximize the power of the low-end frequencies in the main channels, as well as in the subwoofer channel.\"[47] Nolan deliberately intended some dialogue to seem drowned out by ambient noise or music, causing some theaters to post notices emphasizing that this effect was intentional and not a fault in their equipment.[48]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Interstellar (soundtrack)\n\nHans Zimmer, who scored Nolan's *The Dark Knight Trilogy* and *Inception* (2010), returned to score *Interstellar*. Nolan chose not to provide Zimmer with a script or any plot details but instead gave him a single page that told the story of a father leaving his child for work. It was through this connection that Zimmer created the early stages of the *Interstellar* soundtrack. Zimmer and Nolan later decided the 1926 four-manual Harrison & Harrison organ of the Temple Church, London, would be the primary instrument for the score.[49][50] Zimmer conducted 45 scoring sessions for *Interstellar*, three times more than for *Inception*. The soundtrack was released on November 18, 2014.[15]\n\n\n\n### Visual effects[edit]\n\n\nThe visual effects company Double Negative, which worked on *Inception*, was brought back for *Interstellar*.[51] According to visual effects supervisor Paul Franklin, the number of effects in the film was not much greater than in Nolan's *The Dark Knight Rises* (2012) or *Inception*. However, for *Interstellar*, they created the effects first, allowing digital projectors to display them behind the actors, rather than having the actors perform in front of green screens.[9] The film contained 850 visual-effect shots at a resolution of 5600 × 4000 lines: 150 shots that were created in-camera using digital projectors, and another 700 were created in post-production. Of those, 620 were presented in IMAX, while the rest were anamorphic.[52]\n\n\nThe ranger, *Endurance*, and lander spacecraft were created using miniature effects by Nathan Crowley in collaboration with effects company New Deal Studios, as opposed to using computer-generated imagery, as Nolan felt they offered the best way to give the ships a tangible presence in space. 3D-printed and hand-sculpted, the scale models earned the nickname \"maxatures\" by the crew due to their immense size; the 1/15th-scale miniature of the *Endurance* module spanned over 7.6 m (25 ft), while a pyrotechnic model of part of the craft was built at 1/5th scale. The Ranger and Lander miniatures spanned 14 m (46 ft) and over 15 m (49 ft), respectively, and were large enough for van Hoytema to mount IMAX cameras directly onto the spacecraft, thus mimicking the look of NASA IMAX documentaries. The models were then attached to a six-axis gimbal on a motion control system that allowed an operator to manipulate their movements, which were filmed against background plates of space using VistaVision cameras on a smaller motion control rig.[53] New Deal Studio's miniatures were used in 150 special effects shots.[52]\n\n\n\n## Influences[edit]\n\n\nNolan was influenced by what he called \"key touchstones\" of science fiction cinema, including *Metropolis* (1927), *2001: A Space Odyssey* (1968), *Blade Runner* (1982),[54] *Star Wars* (1977), and *Alien* (1979).[55] Andrei Tarkovsky's *The Mirror* (1975) influenced \"elemental things in the story to do with wind and dust and water\", according to Nolan,[56] who also compared *Interstellar* to *The Treasure of the Sierra Madre* (1948) as a film about human nature.[57] He sought to emulate films like Steven Spielberg's *Jaws* (1975) and *Close Encounters of the Third Kind* (1977) for being family-friendly but also \"as edgy and incisive and challenging as anything else on the blockbuster spectrum\". He screened *The Right Stuff* (1983) for the crew before production,[9] following in its example by capturing reflections on the *Interstellar* astronauts' visors. For further inspiration, Nolan invited former astronaut Marsha Ivins to the set.[16] Nolan and his crew studied the IMAX NASA documentaries of filmmaker Toni Myers for visual reference of spacefaring missions, and strove to imitate their use of IMAX cameras in the enclosed spaces of spacecraft interiors.[58] Clark Kent's upbringing in *Man of Steel* (2013) was the inspiration for the farm setting in the Midwest.[25] Apart from the films, Nolan drew inspiration from the architecture of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe.[16]\n\n\n\n## Scientific accuracy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kip Thorne, a theoretical physicist and Nobel Laureate, served as scientific consultant and executive producer.\nRegarding the concepts of wormholes and black holes, Kip Thorne said he \"worked on the equations that would enable tracing of light rays as they traveled through a wormhole or around a black hole—so what you see is based on Einstein's general relativity equations\".[59] Early in the process, Thorne laid down two guidelines: \"First, that nothing would violate established physical laws. Second, that all the wild speculations ... would spring from science and not from the fertile mind of a screenwriter.\" Nolan accepted these terms as long as they did not get in the way of making the film.[13] At one point, Thorne spent two weeks arguing Nolan out of having a character traveling faster than light before Nolan finally gave up.[60] According to Thorne, the element that has the highest degree of artistic freedom is the clouds of ice on one of the planets they visit, which are structures that would go beyond the material strength that ice could support.[13]\n\n\nThe astrobiologist David Grinspoon criticized the dire \"blight\" situation on Earth portrayed in the early scenes, pointing out that even with a voracious blight it would have taken millions of years to reduce the atmosphere's oxygen content. He also notes that gravity should have pulled down the ice clouds.[61] Neil deGrasse Tyson, an astrophysicist, explored the science behind the ending of *Interstellar*, concluding that it is theoretically possible to interact with the past, and that \"we don't really know what's in a black hole, so take it and run with it\".[62] The theoretical physicist Michio Kaku praised the film for its scientific accuracy and said *Interstellar* \"could set the gold standard for science fiction movies for years to come\". Timothy Reyes, a former NASA software engineer, said \"Thorne's and Nolan's accounting of black holes and wormholes and the use of gravity is excellent\".[63]\n\n\n\n### Wormholes and black holes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Miller's planet orbiting Gargantua\nTo create the visual effects for the wormhole and a rotating, supermassive black hole (possessing an ergosphere, as opposed to a non-rotating black hole), Thorne collaborated with Franklin and a team of 30 people at Double Negative, providing pages of deeply sourced theoretical equations to the engineers, who then wrote new CGI rendering software based on these equations to create accurate simulations of the gravitational lensing caused by these phenomena. Some individual frames took up to 100 hours to render, totaling 800 terabytes of data.[10] Thorne described the accretion disk of the black hole as \"anemic and at low temperature[64]—about the temperature of the surface of the sun,\" allowing it to emit appreciable light, but not enough gamma radiation and X-rays to threaten nearby astronauts and planets.[65] The resulting visual effects provided Thorne with new insight into the gravitational lensing and accretion disks surrounding black holes, resulting in the publication of three scientific papers.[66][67][68]\n\n\n\n![](image)The first image of the event horizon of a black hole, obtained by the Event Horizon Telescope. The asymmetric brightness of the accretion disk is well visible here.\nNolan was initially concerned that a scientifically accurate depiction of a black hole would not be visually comprehensible to an audience, and would require the effects team to unrealistically alter its appearance. The visual representation of the black hole in the film does not account for the Doppler effect which, when added by the visual effects team, resulted in an asymmetrically lit black and blue-black hole, the purpose of which Nolan thought the audience would not understand. As a result, it was omitted in the finished product.[69] Nolan found the finished effect to be understandable, as long as he maintained consistent camera perspectives.[70]\n\n\nAs a reference, the asymmetric brightness of the accretion disk is very well visible in the first image[71] of the event horizon of a black hole obtained by the Event Horizon Telescope team in 2019. *Futura-Sciences* praised the correct depiction of the Penrose process.[72]\n\n\nAccording to Space.com, the portrayal of what a wormhole would look like is scientifically correct. Rather than a two-dimensional hole in space, it is depicted as a sphere, showing a distorted view of the target galaxy.[73]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nThe teaser trailer for *Interstellar* debuted December 13, 2013, and featured clips related to space exploration, accompanied by a voiceover by Matthew McConaughey's character, Cooper.[74] The theatrical trailer debuted May 5, 2014, at the Lockheed Martin IMAX Theater in Washington, D.C., and was made available online later that month. For the week ending on May 19, it was the most-viewed film trailer, with over 19.5 million views on YouTube.[75]\n\n\nChristopher Nolan and McConaughey made their first appearances at San Diego Comic-Con in July 2014 to promote *Interstellar*. That same month, Paramount Pictures launched an interactive website, on which users uncovered a star chart related to the Apollo 11 Moon landing.[76]\n\n\nIn October 2014, Paramount partnered with Google to promote *Interstellar* across multiple platforms.[77] The film's website was relaunched as a digital hub hosted on a Google domain,[78] which collected feedback from film audiences, and linked to a mobile app.[78] It featured a game in which players could build Solar System models and use a flight simulator for space travel.[79] The Paramount–Google partnership also included a virtual time capsule compiled with user-generated content, made available in 2015.[80] The initiative Google for Education used the film as a basis for promoting math and science lesson plans in schools.[77][81]\n\n\nParamount provided a virtual reality walkthrough of the *Endurance* spacecraft using Oculus Rift technology. It hosted the walkthrough sequentially in New York City, Houston, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C., from October 6 through November 19, 2014.[82][83] The publisher Running Press released *Interstellar: Beyond Time and Space*, a book by Mark Cotta Vaz about the making of the film, on November 11.[84] W. W. Norton & Company released *The Science of Interstellar*, a book by Thorne;[85] Titan Books released the official novelization, written by Greg Keyes;[86] and *Wired* magazine released a tie-in online comic, *Absolute Zero*, written by Christopher Nolan and drawn by Sean Gordon Murphy. The comic is a prequel to the film, with Mann as the protagonist.[87]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\nBefore *Interstellar*'s public release, Paramount CEO Brad Grey hosted a private screening on October 19, 2014, at an IMAX theater in Lincoln Square, Manhattan.[88][89] Paramount then showed *Interstellar* to some of the industry's filmmakers and actors in a first-look screening at the California Science Center on October 22.[90] On the following day, the film was screened at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles, California for over 900 members of the Screen Actors Guild.[91] The film premiered on October 26 at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles,[92] and in Europe on October 29 at the Odeon Leicester Square in London. The film premiered on November 7 in Canada.[93][94]\n\n\n*Interstellar* was released early on November 4 in various 70 mm IMAX film, 70 mm film and 35 mm film theaters, and had a limited release in North America on November 5, with a wide release on November 7.[95] The film was released in Belgium, France, and Switzerland on November 5, the UK on November 7 and in additional territories in the following days.[96] For the limited North American release, *Interstellar* was projected from 70 mm and 35 mm film in 249 theaters that still supported those formats, including at least forty-one 70 mm IMAX theaters. A 70 mm IMAX projector was installed at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles to display the format. The film's wide release expanded to theaters that showed it digitally.[97] Paramount Pictures distributed the film in North America, and Warner Bros. distributed it in the remaining territories.[32] The film was released in over 770 IMAX screens worldwide, which was the largest global release in IMAX cinemas,[98][99] until surpassed by Universal Pictures' *Furious 7* (2015) with 810 IMAX theaters.[100]\n\n\n*Interstellar* was an exception to Paramount Pictures' goal to stop releasing films on film stock and to distribute them only in digital format.[101] According to Pamela McClintock of *The Hollywood Reporter*, the initiative to project *Interstellar* on film stock would help preserve an endangered format,[97] which was supported by Christopher Nolan, J. J. Abrams, Quentin Tarantino, Judd Apatow, Paul Thomas Anderson, and other filmmakers.[102] McClintock reported that theatre owners saw this as \"backward,\" as nearly all theatres in the US had been converted to digital projection.[103]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Interstellar* was released on home video on March 31, 2015, in both the United Kingdom and United States.[104] It topped the home video sales chart for a total of two weeks.[105][106] It was reported that *Interstellar* was the most pirated film of 2015, with an estimated 46.7 million downloads on BitTorrent.[107] It was released in the Ultra HD Blu-ray format on December 19, 2017.[108]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n*Interstellar* grossed $188 million in the US and Canada, and $493 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $681 million on original release, against a production budget of $165 million.[3] *Deadline Hollywood* calculated net profit to be $47 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs, with box office grosses, and ancillary revenues from home media, placing it 20th on their list of 2014's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".[109] It sold an estimated 22 million tickets domestically.[110]\n\n\nThe film set an IMAX opening record worldwide with $20.5 million from 574 IMAX theaters, surpassing the $17 million record held by *The Hunger Games: Catching Fire* (2013), and is the best opening for an IMAX 2D, non-sequel, and November IMAX release.[111] It had a worldwide opening of $133 million, which was the tenth-largest opening of 2014,[112] and became the tenth-highest-grossing film of 2014.[113] *Interstellar* is the fourth film to gross over $100 million worldwide from IMAX ticket sales.[114][115][116] It was released in the UK, Ireland and Malta on November 6, 2014, and debuted at number one earning £5.5 million ($8.6 million) in its opening weekend, which was lower than the openings of *The Dark Knight Rises* (£14.4 million), *Gravity* (£6.2 million), and *Inception* (£5.9 million).[117] The film was released in 35 markets on the same day, including major markets like Germany, Russia, Australia, and Brazil earning $8.7 million in total.[118] Through Sunday, it earned an opening weekend total of $83 million from 11.1 million admissions from over 14,800 screens in 62 markets.[119] It earned $7.3 million from 206 IMAX screens, at an average of 35,400 viewers per theater.[120] It went to number one in South Korea ($14.4 million),[121] Russia ($8.9 million), and France ($5.3 million). Other strong openings occurred in Germany ($4.6 million), India ($4.3 million), Italy ($3.7 million), Australia ($3.7 million), Spain ($2.7 million), Mexico ($3.1 million), and Brazil ($1.9 million).[122] *Interstellar* was released in China on November 12 and earned $5.4 million on its opening day on Wednesday, which is Nolan's biggest opening in China after surpassing the $4.61 million opening record of *The Dark Knight Rises*.[123][124] It went on to earn $41.7 million in its opening weekend, accounting for 55% of the market share.[125][126] It is Nolan's biggest opening in China, Warner Bros.' biggest 2D opening,[127] and the studio's third-biggest opening of all time, behind 2014's *The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies* ($49.5 million)[128] and 2013's *Pacific Rim* ($45 million).[129][130][*needs update?*]\n\n\nIt topped the box office outside North America for two consecutive weekends before being overtaken by *The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1* (2014) in its third weekend.[127] Just 31 days after its release, the film became the 13th-most-successful film and 3rd-most-successful foreign film in South Korea with 9.1 million admissions trailing only *Avatar* (13.3 million admissions), and 2013's *Frozen* (10.3 million admissions).[131] The film closed down its theatrical run in China on December 12, with total revenue of $122.6 million.[132][133] In total earnings, its largest markets outside North America and China were South Korea ($73.4 million), the UK, Ireland and Malta ($31.3 million), and Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) ($19 million).[134] *Interstellar* and *Big Hero 6* opened the same weekend (November 7–9, 2014) in the US and Canada. Both were forecast to earn between $55 million and $60 million.[135] In North America, the film is the seventh-highest-grossing film to not hit No. 1, with a top rank of No. 2 on its opening weekend.[136] *Interstellar* had an early limited release in the US and Canada in selected theaters on November 4 at 8:00 pm, coinciding with the 2014 US midterm elections.[137] It topped the box office the following day, earning $1.35 million from 249 theaters (42 of which were IMAX screens); IMAX accounted for 62% of its total gross.[138] Two hundred and forty of those theaters played in 35 mm, 70 mm, and IMAX 70 mm film formats.[139] It earned $3.6 million from late-night shows for a previews total of $4.9 million.[140][141][142] The film was widely released on November 7 and topped the box office on its opening day, earning $17 million ahead of *Big Hero 6* ($15.8 million).[143] On its opening weekend, the film earned $47.5 million[b] from 3,561 theaters, debuting in second place after a neck-and-neck competition with Disney's *Big Hero 6* ($56.2 million).[145] IMAX comprised $13.2 million (28%) of its opening weekend gross,[145] while other premium large-format screens comprised $5.3 million (10.5%) of the gross.[146][147] In its second weekend, the film fell to No. 3 behind *Big Hero 6* and newcomer *Dumb and Dumber To* (2014), and dropped 39% earning $29 million for a two-weekend total of $98 million.[148][149] It earned $7.4 million from IMAX theaters from 368 screens in its second weekend.[150][151] In its third week, the film earned $15 million and remained at No. 3, below newcomer *The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1* and *Big Hero 6*.[152]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 73% of 378 critic reviews are positive, with an average of 7.1/10. The site's critics consensus reads, \"*Interstellar* represents more of the thrilling, thought-provoking, and visually resplendent filmmaking moviegoers have come to expect from writer-director Christopher Nolan, even if its intellectual reach somewhat exceeds its grasp.\"[153] Metacritic assigned the film a score of 74 out of 100 based on 46 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[154] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave it an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.[155]\n\n\nScott Foundas, chief film critic at *Variety*, said that *Interstellar* is \"as visually and conceptually audacious as anything Nolan has yet done\" and considered the film \"more personal\" than Nolan's previous films.[156] Claudia Puig of *USA Today* praised the visual spectacle and powerful themes, while criticizing the \"dull\" dialogue and \"tedious patches inside the space vessel.\"[157] David Stratton of *At the Movies* rated the film four-and-a-half stars out of five, commending its ambition, effects, and 70 mm IMAX presentation, though criticizing the sound for \"being so loud\" as to make some of the dialogue \"inaudible\". Conversely, co-host Margaret Pomeranz rated the film three out of five, as she felt the human drama got lost among the film's scientific concepts.[158] Henry Barnes of *The Guardian* scored the film three out of five stars, calling it \"a glorious spectacle, but a slight drama, with few characters and too-rare flashes of humour.\"[159] James Berardinelli called *Interstellar* \"an amazing achievement\" and \"simultaneously a big-budget science fiction endeavor and a very simple tale of love and sacrifice. It is by turns edgy, breathtaking, hopeful, and heartbreaking.\"[160] He named it the best film of 2014,[161] and the second-best movie of the decade, deeming it a \"*real* science fiction rather than the crowd-pleasing, watered-down version Hollywood typically offers\".[162]\n\n\n\n> \n> \"It's been a while since somebody has come out with such a big vision to things ... Even the elements, the fact that dust is everywhere, and they're living in this dust bowl that is just completely enveloping this area of the world. That's almost something you expect from Tarkovsky or Malick, not a science fiction adventure movie.[163]\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—Quentin Tarantino on *Interstellar*.\n\nOliver Gettell of the *Los Angeles Times* reported that \"film critics largely agree that *Interstellar* is an entertaining, emotional, and thought-provoking sci-fi saga, even if it can also be clunky and sentimental at times.\"[164] James Dyer of *Empire* awarded the film a full five stars, describing it as \"brainy, barmy, and beautiful to behold ... a mind-bending opera of space and time with a soul wrapped up in all the science.\"[165] Dave Calhoun of *Time Out London* also granted the film a maximum score of five stars, stating that it is \"a bold, beautiful cosmic adventure story with a touch of the surreal and the dreamlike.\"[166] Richard Roeper of *Chicago Sun-Times* awarded the film a full four stars and wrote, \"This is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen—in terms of its visuals, and its overriding message about the powerful forces of the one thing we all know but can't measure in scientific terms. Love.\"[167]\n\n\nDescribing Nolan as a \"merchant of awe,\" Tim Robey of *The Telegraph* thought that *Interstellar* was \"agonisingly\" close to a masterpiece, highlighting the conceptual boldness and \"deep-digging intelligence\" of the film.[168] Todd McCarthy of *The Hollywood Reporter* wrote, \"This grandly conceived and executed epic tries to give equal weight to intimate human emotions and speculation about the cosmos, with mixed results, but is never less than engrossing, and sometimes more than that.\"[169] In his review for the Associated Press, Jake Coyle praised the film for its \"big-screen grandeur,\" while finding some of the dialogue \"clunky.\" He described it further as \"an absurd endeavor\" and \"one of the most sublime movies of the decade.\"[170] Scott Mendelson of *Forbes* listed *Interstellar* as one of the most disappointing films of 2014, stating that the film \"has a lack of flow, loss of momentum following the climax, clumsy sound mixing,\" and \"thin characters\" despite seeing the film twice in order to \"give it a second chance.\" He wrote that *Interstellar* \"ends up as a stripped-down and somewhat muted variation on any number of 'go into space to save the world' movies.\"[171] Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, saying that despite his usual quibbles regarding Nolan's excessive dialogue and its lack of a sense of composition, \"[*Interstellar*] is still an impressive, at times astonishing movie that overwhelmed me to the point where my usual objections to Nolan's work melted away ... At times, the movie's one-stop-shopping storytelling evokes the tough-tender spirit of a John Ford picture ... a movie that would rather try to be eight or nine things than just one.\"[172]\n\n\n*New York Times* columnist David Brooks concludes that *Interstellar* explores the relationships among \"science and faith and science and the humanities\" and \"illustrates the real symbiosis between these realms.\"[173] Mark Steyn commented on the technological future and the focus on the father-daughter relationship. [174] Wai Chee Dimock, in the *Los Angeles Review of Books*, wrote that Nolan's films are \"rotatable at 90, 180, and 360 degrees,\" and that \"although there is considerable magical thinking here, making it almost an anti-sci-fi film, holding out hope that the end of the planet is not the end of everything, it reverses itself, however, when that magic falls short when the poetic license is naked and plain for all to see.\"[175] Author George R. R. Martin called *Interstellar* \"the most ambitious and challenging science fiction film since Kubrick's *2001*.\"[176] In 2020, *Empire* magazine ranked it as one of the best films of the 21st century.[177]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by Interstellar\n\nAt the 87th Academy Awards, *Interstellar* received nominations for Best Original Score, Best Production Design, Best Sound Editing, and Best Sound Mixing, and won Best Visual Effects.[178]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Film portal\n* ![icon](image)Speculative fiction portal\n\n\n* Black holes in fiction\n* Blanet – planet orbiting a black hole\n* Causal loop\n* Interstellar travel\n* List of American films of 2014\n* List of British films of 2014\n* List of films featuring drones\n* List of films featuring space stations\n* List of time travel works of fiction\n* Starship\n* Wormholes in fiction\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Referred to only as \"Cooper\" or \"Coop\" in the film\n2. **^** In total the film earned $2.2 million from the two late-night showings which would bring its opening weekend gross to $49.7 million.[144]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Interstellar\".

His feature directorial debut was the neo-noir crime thriller *Following* (1998) which was made on a shoestring budget of $6,000.[1][note 1] Two years later, he directed the psychological thriller *Memento* (2000) which starred Guy Pearce as a man suffering from anterograde amnesia (short-term memory loss) searching for his wife's killers.[3] Similar to his debut feature it had a non-linear narrative structure, and was his breakthrough film.[4] It was acclaimed by critics and was a surprise commercial success.[5] For the film Nolan received his first nomination for the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing – Feature Film, and for writing its screenplay he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.[6][7] He next directed the mystery thriller remake *Insomnia* (2002) which starred Al Pacino, Robin Williams, and Hilary Swank.[8] It was his first film for Warner Bros., and was a critical and commercial success.[9][10]\n\n\nIn 2005, Nolan directed Warner Bros' superhero film *Batman Begins* which starred Christian Bale and told an origin story of the title character.[11] The following year, he directed psychological thriller *The Prestige* (2006) in which Bale and Hugh Jackman played rival 19th-century stage magicians.[12] His next film was the sequel to *Batman Begins*, *The Dark Knight*, in which Bale reprised his role as Batman opposite Heath Ledger as the Joker. The film grossed a worldwide total of over $1 billion, and was the highest grossing of 2008.[13] It received eight nominations at the 81st Academy Awards, and Nolan received his second nomination at the Directors Guild of America Awards.[14][15] In 2010, he directed the action film *Inception* starring Leonardo DiCaprio as a thief who leads a team who steal information by entering a person's subconscious.[16] It was nominated for Best Film at the Academy Awards, British Academy Film Awards, and Golden Globe Awards, and Nolan received his third nomination at the Directors Guild of America Awards.[17]\n\n\nTwo years later, he directed *The Dark Knight Rises* (2012), which grossed a worldwide total at the box office of over $1 billion.[18] He followed this by producing Zack Snyder's superhero film *Man of Steel* (2013) and directing the science fiction film *Interstellar* (2014), which starred Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, and Jessica Chastain. It won the Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film.[19] In 2017, Nolan directed the war film *Dunkirk*, for which he received his first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Director.[20] Three years later he directed the science fiction film *Tenet* (2020).[21] His next feature was *Oppenheimer* (2023), a biopic centered on J. Robert Oppenheimer, with Cillian Murphy starring as the titular character.[22]\n\n\n\n\n## Feature films[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Director | Writer | Producer | Notes\n | Ref(s) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1998\n | *Following* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | Also cinematographer and editor\n | [23] |\n| 2000\n | *Memento* | Yes\n | Yes\n | No\n |  | [23][24] |\n| 2002\n | *Insomnia* | Yes\n | No\n | No\n |  | [23][24] |\n| 2005\n | *Batman Begins* | Yes\n | Yes\n | No\n |  | [23][24] |\n| 2006\n | *The Prestige* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n |  | [23][24] |\n| 2008\n | *The Dark Knight* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n |  | [23][24] |\n| 2010\n | *Inception* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n |  | [23][24] |\n| 2012\n | *The Dark Knight Rises* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n |  | [23][24] |\n| 2013\n | *Man of Steel* | No\n | Story\n | Yes\n |  | [23] |\n| 2014\n | *Interstellar* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n |  | [23][24] |\n| 2017\n | *Dunkirk* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n |  | [23][24] |\n| 2020\n | *Tenet* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n |  | [9][25] |\n| 2023\n | *Oppenheimer* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n |  | [26] |\n\n\n**Executive producer**\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Notes\n | Ref(s) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2014\n | *Transcendence* |  | [23][24] |\n| 2016\n | *Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice* |  | [23][24] |\n| 2017\n | *Justice League* |  | [23][24] |\n| 2019\n | *The Doll's Breath* | Animated short film\n | [27] |\n| 2021\n | *Zack Snyder's Justice League* | Director's cut of 2017's *Justice League* | [28] |\n\n\n## Short films[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Director | Writer | Producer | Cinematographer | Editor | Notes\n | Ref(s) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1989\n | *Tarantella* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | No official release, available on Media Burn Independent Video ArchiveCo-directed with Roko Belic | [23][29] |\n| 1996\n | *Larceny* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | No official release\n | [23][24] |\n| 1997\n | *Doodlebug* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n |  | [23] |\n| 2015\n | *Quay* | Yes\n | No\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | Also composerDocumentary short\n | [23] |\n\n\n## Documentary appearances[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Ref(s) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2011\n | *These Amazing Shadows* | [24] |\n| 2012\n | *Side by Side* | [23][24] |\n| 2016\n | *Cinema Futures* | [30] |\n| 2018\n | *James Cameron's Story of Science Fiction* | [31] |\n| 2019\n | *Making Waves: The Art of Cinematic Sound* | [32] |\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n\n1. **^** Nolan directed a feature, *Larry Mahoney*, in the mid-1990s, but it was scrapped and never released.[2]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Sims, David (16 March 2016). \"How Memento Set the Framework for Christopher Nolan's Career\". *The Atlantic*.

His feature directorial debut was the neo-noir crime thriller *Following* (1998) which was made on a shoestring budget of $6,000.[1][note 1] Two years later, he directed the psychological thriller *Memento* (2000) which starred Guy Pearce as a man suffering from anterograde amnesia (short-term memory loss) searching for his wife's killers.[3] Similar to his debut feature it had a non-linear narrative structure, and was his breakthrough film.[4] It was acclaimed by critics and was a surprise commercial success.[5] For the film Nolan received his first nomination for the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing – Feature Film, and for writing its screenplay he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.[6][7] He next directed the mystery thriller remake *Insomnia* (2002) which starred Al Pacino, Robin Williams, and Hilary Swank.[8] It was his first film for Warner Bros., and was a critical and commercial success.[9][10]\n\n\nIn 2005, Nolan directed Warner Bros' superhero film *Batman Begins* which starred Christian Bale and told an origin story of the title character.[11] The following year, he directed psychological thriller *The Prestige* (2006) in which Bale and Hugh Jackman played rival 19th-century stage magicians.[12] His next film was the sequel to *Batman Begins*, *The Dark Knight*, in which Bale reprised his role as Batman opposite Heath Ledger as the Joker. The film grossed a worldwide total of over $1 billion, and was the highest grossing of 2008.[13] It received eight nominations at the 81st Academy Awards, and Nolan received his second nomination at the Directors Guild of America Awards.[14][15] In 2010, he directed the action film *Inception* starring Leonardo DiCaprio as a thief who leads a team who steal information by entering a person's subconscious.[16] It was nominated for Best Film at the Academy Awards, British Academy Film Awards, and Golden Globe Awards, and Nolan received his third nomination at the Directors Guild of America Awards.[17]\n\n\nTwo years later, he directed *The Dark Knight Rises* (2012), which grossed a worldwide total at the box office of over $1 billion.[18] He followed this by producing Zack Snyder's superhero film *Man of Steel* (2013) and directing the science fiction film *Interstellar* (2014), which starred Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, and Jessica Chastain. It won the Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film.[19] In 2017, Nolan directed the war film *Dunkirk*, for which he received his first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Director.[20] Three years later he directed the science fiction film *Tenet* (2020).[21] His next feature was *Oppenheimer* (2023), a biopic centered on J. Robert Oppenheimer, with Cillian Murphy starring as the titular character.[22]\n\n\n\n\n## Feature films[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Director | Writer | Producer | Notes\n | Ref(s) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1998\n | *Following* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | Also cinematographer and editor\n | [23] |\n| 2000\n | *Memento* | Yes\n | Yes\n | No\n |  | [23][24] |\n| 2002\n | *Insomnia* | Yes\n | No\n | No\n |  | [23][24] |\n| 2005\n | *Batman Begins* | Yes\n | Yes\n | No\n |  | [23][24] |\n| 2006\n | *The Prestige* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n |  | [23][24] |\n| 2008\n | *The Dark Knight* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n |  | [23][24] |\n| 2010\n | *Inception* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n |  | [23][24] |\n| 2012\n | *The Dark Knight Rises* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n |  | [23][24] |\n| 2013\n | *Man of Steel* | No\n | Story\n | Yes\n |  | [23] |\n| 2014\n | *Interstellar* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n |  | [23][24] |\n| 2017\n | *Dunkirk* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n |  | [23][24] |\n| 2020\n | *Tenet* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n |  | [9][25] |\n| 2023\n | *Oppenheimer* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n |  | [26] |\n\n\n**Executive producer**\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Notes\n | Ref(s) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2014\n | *Transcendence* |  | [23][24] |\n| 2016\n | *Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice* |  | [23][24] |\n| 2017\n | *Justice League* |  | [23][24] |\n| 2019\n | *The Doll's Breath* | Animated short film\n | [27] |\n| 2021\n | *Zack Snyder's Justice League* | Director's cut of 2017's *Justice League* | [28] |\n\n\n## Short films[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Director | Writer | Producer | Cinematographer | Editor | Notes\n | Ref(s) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1989\n | *Tarantella* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | No official release, available on Media Burn Independent Video ArchiveCo-directed with Roko Belic | [23][29] |\n| 1996\n | *Larceny* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | No official release\n | [23][24] |\n| 1997\n | *Doodlebug* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n |  | [23] |\n| 2015\n | *Quay* | Yes\n | No\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | Also composerDocumentary short\n | [23] |\n\n\n## Documentary appearances[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Ref(s) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2011\n | *These Amazing Shadows* | [24] |\n| 2012\n | *Side by Side* | [23][24] |\n| 2016\n | *Cinema Futures* | [30] |\n| 2018\n | *James Cameron's Story of Science Fiction* | [31] |\n| 2019\n | *Making Waves: The Art of Cinematic Sound* | [32] |\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n\n1. **^** Nolan directed a feature, *Larry Mahoney*, in the mid-1990s, but it was scrapped and never released.[2]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Sims, David (16 March 2016). \"How Memento Set the Framework for Christopher Nolan's Career\". *The Atlantic*.
