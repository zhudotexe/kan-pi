Besides the *Star Wars* and *Superman* franchises, *James Bond* and *Godzilla* films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then *Gone with the Wind*—which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years—is still the highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n## Highest-grossing films[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Gone with the Wind* is likewise represented twice on the chart: the 1940 entry includes earnings from its staggered 1939–1942 release (roadshow/​general release/​second-run)[86] along with all of its revenue up to the 1961 reissue prior to losing the record to *The Sound of Music* in 1966; its 1971 entry—after it took back the record—includes income from the 1967 and 1971 reissues but omitting later releases. *The Godfather* was re-released in 1973 after its success at the 45th Academy Awards, and *Jaws* was released again in 1976, and their grosses here most likely include earnings from those releases. *The Sound of Music*, *The Godfather*, *Jaws*, *Jurassic Park*, and *Titanic* increased their earnings with further releases in 1973, 1997, 1979, 2013, and 2012, respectively, but they are not included in the totals here because they had already conceded the record prior to being re-released.\n\n\n\n\n\nTimeline of the highest-grossing film record\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHighest-grossing films as of 2022[update] adjusted for inflation[35][Inf]\n| Rank\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross(2022 $)\n | Year\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | *Gone with the Wind* | $4,192,000,000\n | 1939\n |\n| 2\n | *Avatar* | A1$3,824,000,000\n | 2009\n |\n| 3\n | *Titanic* | $2,516,000,000T$3,485,000,000\n | 1997\n |\n| 4\n | *Star Wars* | $3,443,000,000\n | 1977\n |\n| 5\n | *Avengers: Endgame* | AE$3,165,000,000\n | 2019\n |\n| 6\n | *The Sound of Music* | $2,884,000,000\n | 1965\n |\n| 7\n | *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* | $2,815,000,000\n | 1982\n |\n| 8\n | *The Ten Commandments* | $2,665,000,000\n | 1956\n |\n| 9\n | *Doctor Zhivago* | $2,526,000,000\n | 1965\n |\n| 10\n | *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* | TFA$2,491,000,000\n | 2015\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHighest-grossing films[12]\n| Rank\n | Peak\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross\n | Year\n | Reference(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 1\n | *Avatar* | $2,923,706,026\n | 2009\n | [# 1][# 2] |\n| 2\n | 1\n | *Avengers: Endgame* | $2,797,501,328\n | 2019\n | [# 3][# 4] |\n| 3\n | 3\n | *Avatar: The Way of Water* | $2,320,250,281\n | 2022\n | [# 5][# 6] |\n| 4\n | 1\n | *Titanic* | T$2,257,844,554\n | 1997\n | [# 7][# 8] |\n| 5\n | 3\n | *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* | $2,068,223,624\n | 2015\n | [# 9][# 10] |\n| 6\n | 4\n | *Avengers: Infinity War* | $2,048,359,754\n | 2018\n | [# 11][# 12] |\n| 7\n | 6\n | *Spider-Man: No Way Home* | $1,921,847,111\n | 2021\n | [# 13][# 14] |\n| 8\n | 3\n | *Jurassic World* | $1,671,537,444\n | 2015\n | [# 15][# 16] |\n| 9\n | 7\n | *The Lion King* | $1,656,943,394\n | 2019\n | [# 17][# 4] |\n| 10\n | 3\n | *The Avengers* | $1,518,815,515\n | 2012\n | [# 18][# 19] |\n| 11\n | 4\n | *Furious 7* | $1,515,341,399\n | 2015\n | [# 20][# 21] |\n| 12\n | 11\n | *Top Gun: Maverick* | $1,495,696,292\n | 2022\n | [# 22][# 23] |\n| 13\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn this chart, films are ranked by the revenues from theatrical exhibition at their nominal value, along with the highest positions they attained.

However, theatrical box-office earnings are the primary metric for trade publications in assessing the success of a film, mostly because of the availability of the data compared to sales figures for home video and broadcast rights, but also because of historical practice. Included on the list are charts of the top box-office earners (ranked by both the nominal and real value of their revenue), a chart of high-grossing films by calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing film franchises and series. All charts are ranked by international theatrical box-office performance where possible, excluding income derived from home video, broadcasting rights, and merchandise.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTraditionally, war films, musicals, and historical dramas have been the most popular genres, but franchise films have been among the best performers of the 21st century. There is strong interest in the superhero genre, with ten films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe featuring among the nominal top-earners. The most successful superhero film, *Avengers: Endgame*, is also the second-highest-grossing film on the nominal earnings chart, and there are four films in total based on the *Avengers* comic books charting in the top twenty. Other Marvel Comics adaptations have also had success with the *Spider-Man* and *X-Men* properties, while films based on *Batman* and *Superman* from DC Comics have generally performed well. *Star Wars* is also represented in the nominal earnings chart with five films, while the *Jurassic Park* franchise features prominently. Although the nominal earnings chart is dominated by films adapted from pre-existing properties and sequels, it is headed by *Avatar*, which is an original work. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ \"X-Men – Worldwide (Unadjusted)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

Cecil B. DeMille (1932, 1947, 1949, 1952 and 1956) is in second place with five films and William Wyler (1942, 1946, 1959 and 1968) and James Cameron (1991, 1997, 2009 and 2022) are tied for third place with four films. D. W. Griffith (1915, 1916 and 1920), George Roy Hill (1966, 1969 and 1973) and the Russo brothers (2016, 2018 and 2019) all feature heavily with three films apiece. George Lucas directed two chart-toppers in 1977 and 1999, but also served in a strong creative capacity as a producer and writer in 1980, 1981, 1983, 1984 and 1989 as well. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThat figure seems far more feasible, as reports of earnings in the Griffith collection list gross receipts for 1915–1919 at slightly more than $5.2 million (including foreign distribution) and total earnings after deducting general office expenses, but not royalties, at about $2 million.\n66. **^** \"Biggest Money Pictures\". *Variety*.

Putting *The Birth of a Nation* in fifth place is open to question, since it is generally conceded to be the top-grossing film of all time. However, it has always been difficult to obtain reliable box-office figures for this film, and it may have been even more difficult in the mid-1930s. After listing it until the mid-1970s as *the* top-grosser, though finding it impossible to quote exact figures, *Variety*, the trade journal, suddenly repudiated the claim but without giving specific details or reasons. On the basis of the number of paid admissions, and *continuous* exhibition, its number one position seems justified.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n60. **^** \"The Dark Knight Rises (2012)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most.

The methodology is based on the concept that films associated with things audiences are already familiar with can be more effectively marketed to them, and as such are known as \"pre-sold\" films within the industry.[108]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 6\n | *Avengers* | $7,767,486,137\n | 4\n | $1,941,871,534\n | *Endgame* ($2,797,501,328)\n |\n| 1\n | *Endgame* (2019) | $2,797,501,328 |\n| 2\n | *Infinity War* (2018) | $2,048,359,754 |\n| 3\n | *The Avengers* (2012) | $1,518,815,515 |\n| 4\n | *Age of Ultron* (2015) | $1,402,809,540\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 7\n | *Fast & Furious* | $7,333,501,460\n | 11\n | $666,681,951\n | *Furious 7* ($1,515,341,399)\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| *20,000 Leagues Under the Sea* | $25,000,134\\*($6,800,000–8,000,000)\\*R | $4,500,000–9,000,000 | [# 191][# 192][# 154][# 193] |\n| 1955 | *Lady and the Tramp* | $187,000,000 ($6,500,000)\\*R | $4,000,000 | [# 194][# 154][# 195] |\n| *Cinerama Holiday* | $21,000,000CI | $2,000,000 | [# 196][# 197] |\n| *Mister Roberts* | $9,900,000R | $2,400,000 | [# 198] |\n| 1956 | *The Ten Commandments* | $90,066,230R($122,700,000/$55,200,000R)\n | $13,270,000 | [# 97][# 199][# 200] |\n| 1957 | *The Bridge on the River Kwai* | $30,600,000R | $2,840,000 | [# 200] |\n| 1958 | *South Pacific* | $30,000,000R | $5,610,000 | [# 201] |\n| 1959 | *Ben-Hur* | $90,000,000R($146,900,000/$66,100,000R)\n | $15,900,000 | [# 202][# 203] |\n| 1960 | *Swiss Family Robinson* | $30,000,000R | $4,000,000 | [# 204] |\n| *Spartacus* | $60,000,000 ($22,105,225)R | $10,284,014 | [# 205][# 206] |\n| *Psycho* | $50,000,000+ ($14,000,000)R | $800,000 | [# 207] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | The Fast Saga | $6,572,768,534\n | 10\n | $657,276,853\n | *Furious 7* ($1,515,341,399)\n |\n| 1\n | *Furious 7* (2015) | $1,515,341,399 |\n| 2\n | *The Fate of the Furious* (2017)*F8* | $1,238,764,765 |\n| 3\n | *Fast & Furious 6* (2013) | $788,680,968 |\n| 4\n | *F9* (2021) | $726,229,501 |\n| 5\n | *Fast X* (2023) | $714,414,576 |\n| 6\n | *Fast Five* (2011) | $626,137,675 |\n| 7\n | *Fast & Furious* (2009) | $360,366,870 |\n| 8\n | *2 Fast 2 Furious* (2003) | $236,350,661 |\n| 9\n | *The Fast and the Furious* (2001) | $207,517,509 |\n| 10\n | *Tokyo Drift* (2006) | $158,964,610\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *Hobbs & Shaw* (2019) | $760,732,926\n |  |\n\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 8\n | *Batman* | $6,843,842,452\n | 17\n | $402,578,968\n | *The Dark Knight Rises* ($1,081,169,825)\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![A portrait of a bespectacled middle aged man.](image)Films directed by Steven Spielberg have been the highest-grossing film of the year on six occasions, and on three occasions have been the highest-grossing film of all time.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n97. **^** Tartaglione, Nancy (March 13, 2021). \"'Avatar' Overtakes 'Avengers: Endgame' As All-Time Highest-Grossing Film At Global Box Office; China Reissue Growing\". *Deadline Hollywood*.

If it were the rental gross then that would have made it not only the highest-grossing film of the year, but one of the highest-grossing films of the silent era, and if that is the case it would be unusual for both *International Motion Picture Almanac* and *Variety* to omit it from their lists.\n\n\nSSIt is not clear if the figure for *Sunny Side Up* is for North America or worldwide.

Since the Cinerama corporation owned the theaters there were no rental fees for the films, meaning the studio received 100% of the box-office gross, unlike the case with most other films where the distributor typically receives less than half the gross. Since *Variety* at the time ranked films by their U.S. and Canadian rental, they constructed a hypothetical rental figure for the Cinerama films to provide a basis for comparison to other films in their chart: in the case of *This Is Cinerama*, the $50 million worldwide gross was reconfigured as a $12.5 million U.S. rental gross; this is exactly 25% of the amount reported by Cinerama, so *Variety*'s formula seemingly halved the gross to obtain an estimate for the U.S. share, and halved it again to simulate a rental fee.[62] All five Cinerama features collectively generated $120 million in worldwide box office receipts.[63]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* *Cleopatra*: \"Domestic Rentals: $0.5; Production Cost: $0.3 (Unadjusted $s in Millions of $s).\"\n88. **^** Birchard, Robert S.

The 1970s saw a shift in audience tastes to high concept films, with six such films made by either George Lucas or Steven Spielberg topping the chart during the 1980s. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 1980 | *The Empire Strikes Back* | $547,969,004 ($413,562,607)SW | $23,000,000–32,000,000 | [# 265][# 266] |\n| 1981 | *Raiders of the Lost Ark* | $389,925,971  ($321,866,000–353,988,025)\n | $18,000,000–22,800,000 | [# 267] |\n| 1982 | *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* | $797,103,542  ($619,000,000–664,000,000)\n | $10,500,000–12,200,000 | [# 268][# 269][# 257][# 270][# 271] |\n| 1983 | *Return of the Jedi* | $482,366,101 ($385,845,197)SW | $32,500,000–42,700,000 | [# 272][# 266] |\n| 1984 | *Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom* | $333,107,271 | $27,000,000–28,200,000 | [# 273][# 274][# 275] |\n| 1985 | *Back to the Future* | $389,225,789 ($381,109,762)\n | $19,000,000–22,000,000 | [# 276][# 277] |\n| 1986 | *Top Gun* | $357,288,178 ($345,000,000)\n | $14,000,000–19,000,000 | [# 278][# 279][# 274] |\n| 1987 | *Fatal Attraction* | $320,145,693 | $14,000,000 | [# 280][# 274] |\n| 1988 | *Rain Man* | $354,825,435 | $30,000,000 | [# 281][# 282] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *The Dark Knight *trilogy** | $2,462,179,755\n | 3\n | $820,726,585\n | *The Dark Knight Rises* ($1,081,169,825)\n |\n| 1\n | *The Dark Knight Rises* (2012) | $1,081,169,825 |\n| 2\n | *The Dark Knight* (2008) | $1,007,336,937 |\n| 3\n | *Batman Begins* (2005) | $373,672,993\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Burton/Schumacher series | $1,253,192,682\n | 4\n | $313,298,171\n | *Batman* ($411,556,825)\n |\n| 1\n | *Batman* (1989) | $411,556,825 |\n| 2\n | *Batman Forever* (1995) | $336,567,531 |\n| 3\n | *Batman Returns* (1992) | $266,832,411 |\n| 4\n | *Batman & Robin* (1997) | $238,235,915\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *Joker* (2019) | $1,074,458,282\n |  |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice* (2016) | $873,637,528\n |  |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *The Batman* (2022) | $772,245,583\n |  |\n\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nBox office\n |\n| --- |\n| Topics | * Box office territory\n* Box-office bomb\n\t+ list\n* Fastest-grossing films\n* Second weekend box office\n\t+ highest-grossing second weekends\n* Sequels\n* Lists of box office number-one films\n\t+ most weekends at number one in North America\n* Four-wall distribution\n |\n| Highest-grossing | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Daniel Craig series | $3,969,513,462\n | 5\n | $793,902,692\n | *Skyfall* ($1,108,569,499)\n |\n| 1\n | *Skyfall* (2012) | $1,108,569,499 |\n| 2\n | *Spectre* (2015) | $880,705,312 |\n| 3\n | *No Time to Die* (2021) | $774,153,007 |\n| 4\n | *Casino Royale* (2006) | $616,505,162 |\n| 5\n | *Quantum of Solace* (2008) | $589,580,482\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Pierce Brosnan series | $1,479,008,618\n | 4\n | $369,752,155\n | *Die Another Day* ($431,971,116)\n |\n| 1\n | *Die Another Day* (2002) | $431,971,116 |\n| 2\n | *The World Is Not Enough* (1999) | $361,832,400 |\n| 3\n | *GoldenEye* (1995) | $352,194,034 |\n| 4\n | *Tomorrow Never Dies* (1997) | $333,011,068\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 9\n | DC Extended Universe*S †* | $6,754,514,016\n | 14\n | $482,465,287\n | *Aquaman* ($1,148,528,393)\n |\n| 1\n | *Aquaman* (2018) | $1,148,528,393 |\n| 2\n | *Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice* (2016) | $873,637,528 |\n| 3\n | *Wonder Woman* (2017) | $822,854,286 |\n| 4\n | *Suicide Squad* (2016) | $746,846,894 |\n| 5\n | *Man of Steel* (2013) | $668,045,518 |\n| 6\n | *Justice League* (2017) | $657,926,987 |\n| 7\n | *Black Adam* (2022) | $393,252,111 |\n| 8\n | *Shazam!* (2019) | $365,971,656 |\n| 9\n | *The Flash* (2023) | $270,633,313 |\n| 10\n | *Birds of Prey* (2020) | $205,372,791 |\n| 11\n | *Wonder Woman 1984* (2020) | $169,601,036 |\n| 12\n | *The Suicide Squad* (2021) | $168,717,425 |\n| 13\n | *Shazam!

Disney films are usually co-directed and some directors have served on several winning teams: Wilfred Jackson, Hamilton Luske, Clyde Geronimi, David Hand, Ben Sharpsteen, Wolfgang Reitherman and Bill Roberts have all co-directed at least two films on the list. Only seven directors have topped the chart in consecutive years: McCarey (1944 and 1945), Nichols (1966 and 1967), Spielberg (1981 and 1982), Jackson (2002 and 2003), Verbinski (2006 and 2007) and the Russo brothers (2018 and 2019).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBecause of the long-term effects of inflation, notably the significant increase of movie theater ticket prices, the list unadjusted for inflation gives far more weight to later films.[22] The unadjusted list, while commonly found in the press, is therefore largely meaningless for comparing films widely separated in time, as many films from earlier eras will never appear on a modern unadjusted list, despite achieving higher commercial success when adjusted for price increases.[23] To compensate for the devaluation of the currency, some charts make adjustments for inflation, but not even this practice fully addresses the issue, since ticket prices and inflation do not necessarily parallel one another. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* \"Frozen (2013) – International Box Office Results: Germany\". *Box Office Mojo*.

With the advent of sound in 1927, the musical—the genre best placed to showcase the new technology—took over as the most popular type of film with audiences, with 1928 and 1929 both being topped by musical films. The genre continued to perform strongly in the 1930s, but the outbreak of World War II saw war-themed films dominate again during this period, starting with *Gone with the Wind* (American Civil War) in 1939, and finishing with *The Best Years of Our Lives* (World War II) in 1946. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* 2018 re-release: \"2001: A Space Odyssey (2018 re-release)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

Besides the *Star Wars* and *Superman* franchises, *James Bond* and *Godzilla* films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then *Gone with the Wind*—which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years—is still the highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n## Highest-grossing films[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Gone with the Wind* is likewise represented twice on the chart: the 1940 entry includes earnings from its staggered 1939–1942 release (roadshow/​general release/​second-run)[86] along with all of its revenue up to the 1961 reissue prior to losing the record to *The Sound of Music* in 1966; its 1971 entry—after it took back the record—includes income from the 1967 and 1971 reissues but omitting later releases. *The Godfather* was re-released in 1973 after its success at the 45th Academy Awards, and *Jaws* was released again in 1976, and their grosses here most likely include earnings from those releases. *The Sound of Music*, *The Godfather*, *Jaws*, *Jurassic Park*, and *Titanic* increased their earnings with further releases in 1973, 1997, 1979, 2013, and 2012, respectively, but they are not included in the totals here because they had already conceded the record prior to being re-released.\n\n\n\n\n\nTimeline of the highest-grossing film record\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHighest-grossing films as of 2022[update] adjusted for inflation[35][Inf]\n| Rank\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross(2022 $)\n | Year\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | *Gone with the Wind* | $4,192,000,000\n | 1939\n |\n| 2\n | *Avatar* | A1$3,824,000,000\n | 2009\n |\n| 3\n | *Titanic* | $2,516,000,000T$3,485,000,000\n | 1997\n |\n| 4\n | *Star Wars* | $3,443,000,000\n | 1977\n |\n| 5\n | *Avengers: Endgame* | AE$3,165,000,000\n | 2019\n |\n| 6\n | *The Sound of Music* | $2,884,000,000\n | 1965\n |\n| 7\n | *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* | $2,815,000,000\n | 1982\n |\n| 8\n | *The Ten Commandments* | $2,665,000,000\n | 1956\n |\n| 9\n | *Doctor Zhivago* | $2,526,000,000\n | 1965\n |\n| 10\n | *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* | TFA$2,491,000,000\n | 2015\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHighest-grossing films[12]\n| Rank\n | Peak\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross\n | Year\n | Reference(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 1\n | *Avatar* | $2,923,706,026\n | 2009\n | [# 1][# 2] |\n| 2\n | 1\n | *Avengers: Endgame* | $2,797,501,328\n | 2019\n | [# 3][# 4] |\n| 3\n | 3\n | *Avatar: The Way of Water* | $2,320,250,281\n | 2022\n | [# 5][# 6] |\n| 4\n | 1\n | *Titanic* | T$2,257,844,554\n | 1997\n | [# 7][# 8] |\n| 5\n | 3\n | *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* | $2,068,223,624\n | 2015\n | [# 9][# 10] |\n| 6\n | 4\n | *Avengers: Infinity War* | $2,048,359,754\n | 2018\n | [# 11][# 12] |\n| 7\n | 6\n | *Spider-Man: No Way Home* | $1,921,847,111\n | 2021\n | [# 13][# 14] |\n| 8\n | 3\n | *Jurassic World* | $1,671,537,444\n | 2015\n | [# 15][# 16] |\n| 9\n | 7\n | *The Lion King* | $1,656,943,394\n | 2019\n | [# 17][# 4] |\n| 10\n | 3\n | *The Avengers* | $1,518,815,515\n | 2012\n | [# 18][# 19] |\n| 11\n | 4\n | *Furious 7* | $1,515,341,399\n | 2015\n | [# 20][# 21] |\n| 12\n | 11\n | *Top Gun: Maverick* | $1,495,696,292\n | 2022\n | [# 22][# 23] |\n| 13\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn this chart, films are ranked by the revenues from theatrical exhibition at their nominal value, along with the highest positions they attained.

However, theatrical box-office earnings are the primary metric for trade publications in assessing the success of a film, mostly because of the availability of the data compared to sales figures for home video and broadcast rights, but also because of historical practice. Included on the list are charts of the top box-office earners (ranked by both the nominal and real value of their revenue), a chart of high-grossing films by calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing film franchises and series. All charts are ranked by international theatrical box-office performance where possible, excluding income derived from home video, broadcasting rights, and merchandise.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTraditionally, war films, musicals, and historical dramas have been the most popular genres, but franchise films have been among the best performers of the 21st century. There is strong interest in the superhero genre, with ten films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe featuring among the nominal top-earners. The most successful superhero film, *Avengers: Endgame*, is also the second-highest-grossing film on the nominal earnings chart, and there are four films in total based on the *Avengers* comic books charting in the top twenty. Other Marvel Comics adaptations have also had success with the *Spider-Man* and *X-Men* properties, while films based on *Batman* and *Superman* from DC Comics have generally performed well. *Star Wars* is also represented in the nominal earnings chart with five films, while the *Jurassic Park* franchise features prominently. Although the nominal earnings chart is dominated by films adapted from pre-existing properties and sequels, it is headed by *Avatar*, which is an original work. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ \"X-Men – Worldwide (Unadjusted)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

Cecil B. DeMille (1932, 1947, 1949, 1952 and 1956) is in second place with five films and William Wyler (1942, 1946, 1959 and 1968) and James Cameron (1991, 1997, 2009 and 2022) are tied for third place with four films. D. W. Griffith (1915, 1916 and 1920), George Roy Hill (1966, 1969 and 1973) and the Russo brothers (2016, 2018 and 2019) all feature heavily with three films apiece. George Lucas directed two chart-toppers in 1977 and 1999, but also served in a strong creative capacity as a producer and writer in 1980, 1981, 1983, 1984 and 1989 as well. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThat figure seems far more feasible, as reports of earnings in the Griffith collection list gross receipts for 1915–1919 at slightly more than $5.2 million (including foreign distribution) and total earnings after deducting general office expenses, but not royalties, at about $2 million.\n66. **^** \"Biggest Money Pictures\". *Variety*.

Putting *The Birth of a Nation* in fifth place is open to question, since it is generally conceded to be the top-grossing film of all time. However, it has always been difficult to obtain reliable box-office figures for this film, and it may have been even more difficult in the mid-1930s. After listing it until the mid-1970s as *the* top-grosser, though finding it impossible to quote exact figures, *Variety*, the trade journal, suddenly repudiated the claim but without giving specific details or reasons. On the basis of the number of paid admissions, and *continuous* exhibition, its number one position seems justified.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n60. **^** \"The Dark Knight Rises (2012)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 1961 | *One Hundred and One Dalmatians* | $303,000,000 | $3,600,000–4,000,000 | [# 194][# 208][# 146] |\n| *West Side Story* | $105,000,000 ($31,800,000)R | $7,000,000 | [# 209][# 210] |\n| 1962 | *Lawrence of Arabia* | $77,324,852 ($69,995,385)\n | $13,800,000 | [# 211][# 212] |\n| *How the West Was Won* | $35,000,000R | $14,483,000 | [# 213] |\n| *The Longest Day* | $33,200,000R | $8,600,000 | [# 210][# 212] |\n| 1963 | *Cleopatra* | $40,300,000R | $31,115,000 | [# 210][# 212] |\n| *From Russia with Love* | $78,900,000/$29,400,000R($12,500,000)R | $2,000,000 | [# 214][# 215][# 216] |\n| 1964 | *My Fair Lady* | $55,000,000R | $17,000,000 | [# 217] |\n| *Goldfinger* | $124,900,000 ($46,000,000)R | $3,000,000 | [# 214][# 216] |\n| *Mary Poppins* | $44,000,000–$50,000,000R | $5,200,000 | [# 218][# 217] |\n| 1965 | *The Sound of Music* | $286,214,076 ($114,600,000)R | $8,000,000 | [# 219][# 210] |\n| 1966 | *The Bible: In the Beginning* | $25,325,000R | $18,000,000 | [# 206][# 220] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 1972 | *The Godfather* | $246,120,974–287,000,000  ($127,600,000–142,000,000)R | $6,000,000–7,200,000 | [# 237][# 236][# 238][# 239] |\n| 1973 | *The Exorcist* | $441,422,808 ($112,300,000)R | $10,000,000 | [# 240][# 241][# 242][# 243] |\n| *The Sting* | $115,000,000R | $5,500,000 | [# 244][# 245] |\n| 1974 | *The Towering Inferno* | $203,336,412 ($104,838,000)R | $14,300,000 | [# 246][# 247][# 248][# 243][# 249] |\n| 1975 | *Jaws* | $476,512,065 ($193,700,000)R | $9,000,000 | [# 250][# 251][# 252] |\n| 1976 | *Rocky* | $225,000,000 ($77,100,000)R | $1,075,000 | [# 253][# 254][# 236][# 255] |\n| 1977 | *Star Wars* | $775,398,007  ($530,000,000SW/$268,500,000R)\n | $11,293,151 | [# 256][# 257][# 236][# 258] |\n| 1978 | *Grease* | $396,271,103 ($341,000,000)\n | $6,000,000 | [# 259][# 260][# 226] |\n| 1979 | *Moonraker* | $210,308,099 | $31,000,000 | [# 261][# 214][# 262] |\n| *Rocky II* | $200,182,160 | $7,000,000 | [# 263][# 264][# 262] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGS*Variety* put the worldwide rental for *The Greatest Show on Earth* at around $18.35 million (with $12.8 million coming from the United States[53]) a year after its release; however, Birchard puts its earnings at just over $15 million up to 1962.

The methodology is based on the concept that films associated with things audiences are already familiar with can be more effectively marketed to them, and as such are known as \"pre-sold\" films within the industry.[108]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 6\n | *Avengers* | $7,767,486,137\n | 4\n | $1,941,871,534\n | *Endgame* ($2,797,501,328)\n |\n| 1\n | *Endgame* (2019) | $2,797,501,328 |\n| 2\n | *Infinity War* (2018) | $2,048,359,754 |\n| 3\n | *The Avengers* (2012) | $1,518,815,515 |\n| 4\n | *Age of Ultron* (2015) | $1,402,809,540\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 7\n | *Fast & Furious* | $7,333,501,460\n | 11\n | $666,681,951\n | *Furious 7* ($1,515,341,399)\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| *20,000 Leagues Under the Sea* | $25,000,134\\*($6,800,000–8,000,000)\\*R | $4,500,000–9,000,000 | [# 191][# 192][# 154][# 193] |\n| 1955 | *Lady and the Tramp* | $187,000,000 ($6,500,000)\\*R | $4,000,000 | [# 194][# 154][# 195] |\n| *Cinerama Holiday* | $21,000,000CI | $2,000,000 | [# 196][# 197] |\n| *Mister Roberts* | $9,900,000R | $2,400,000 | [# 198] |\n| 1956 | *The Ten Commandments* | $90,066,230R($122,700,000/$55,200,000R)\n | $13,270,000 | [# 97][# 199][# 200] |\n| 1957 | *The Bridge on the River Kwai* | $30,600,000R | $2,840,000 | [# 200] |\n| 1958 | *South Pacific* | $30,000,000R | $5,610,000 | [# 201] |\n| 1959 | *Ben-Hur* | $90,000,000R($146,900,000/$66,100,000R)\n | $15,900,000 | [# 202][# 203] |\n| 1960 | *Swiss Family Robinson* | $30,000,000R | $4,000,000 | [# 204] |\n| *Spartacus* | $60,000,000 ($22,105,225)R | $10,284,014 | [# 205][# 206] |\n| *Psycho* | $50,000,000+ ($14,000,000)R | $800,000 | [# 207] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | The Fast Saga | $6,572,768,534\n | 10\n | $657,276,853\n | *Furious 7* ($1,515,341,399)\n |\n| 1\n | *Furious 7* (2015) | $1,515,341,399 |\n| 2\n | *The Fate of the Furious* (2017)*F8* | $1,238,764,765 |\n| 3\n | *Fast & Furious 6* (2013) | $788,680,968 |\n| 4\n | *F9* (2021) | $726,229,501 |\n| 5\n | *Fast X* (2023) | $714,414,576 |\n| 6\n | *Fast Five* (2011) | $626,137,675 |\n| 7\n | *Fast & Furious* (2009) | $360,366,870 |\n| 8\n | *2 Fast 2 Furious* (2003) | $236,350,661 |\n| 9\n | *The Fast and the Furious* (2001) | $207,517,509 |\n| 10\n | *Tokyo Drift* (2006) | $158,964,610\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *Hobbs & Shaw* (2019) | $760,732,926\n |  |\n\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 8\n | *Batman* | $6,843,842,452\n | 17\n | $402,578,968\n | *The Dark Knight Rises* ($1,081,169,825)\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![A portrait of a bespectacled middle aged man.](image)Films directed by Steven Spielberg have been the highest-grossing film of the year on six occasions, and on three occasions have been the highest-grossing film of all time.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n97. **^** Tartaglione, Nancy (March 13, 2021). \"'Avatar' Overtakes 'Avengers: Endgame' As All-Time Highest-Grossing Film At Global Box Office; China Reissue Growing\". *Deadline Hollywood*.

The total for *Avatar*'s first appearance on the chart includes revenue from the 2010 Special Edition, which represents all of its earnings up to the point it relinquished the record, whereas its second appearance also incorporates revenue from a 2020 re-release in the Asia-Pacific region as well as the 2021 re-release in China which helped it to reclaim the record. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n35. ^ ***a*** ***b*** *Guinness World Records*.

Once revenue from home entertainment is factored in, it is not immediately clear which film is the most successful. *Titanic* earned $1.2 billion from video and DVD sales and rentals,[1] in addition to the $2.2 billion it grossed in theatres. While complete sales data are not available for *Avatar*, it earned $345 million from the sale of sixteen million DVD and Blu-ray units in North America,[2] and ultimately sold a total of thirty million DVD and Blu-ray units worldwide.[3] After home video income is accounted for, both films have earned over $3 billion each. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n22. **^** \"Top Gun: Maverick (2022)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

If it were the rental gross then that would have made it not only the highest-grossing film of the year, but one of the highest-grossing films of the silent era, and if that is the case it would be unusual for both *International Motion Picture Almanac* and *Variety* to omit it from their lists.\n\n\nSSIt is not clear if the figure for *Sunny Side Up* is for North America or worldwide.

Since the Cinerama corporation owned the theaters there were no rental fees for the films, meaning the studio received 100% of the box-office gross, unlike the case with most other films where the distributor typically receives less than half the gross. Since *Variety* at the time ranked films by their U.S. and Canadian rental, they constructed a hypothetical rental figure for the Cinerama films to provide a basis for comparison to other films in their chart: in the case of *This Is Cinerama*, the $50 million worldwide gross was reconfigured as a $12.5 million U.S. rental gross; this is exactly 25% of the amount reported by Cinerama, so *Variety*'s formula seemingly halved the gross to obtain an estimate for the U.S. share, and halved it again to simulate a rental fee.[62] All five Cinerama features collectively generated $120 million in worldwide box office receipts.[63]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* *Cleopatra*: \"Domestic Rentals: $0.5; Production Cost: $0.3 (Unadjusted $s in Millions of $s).\"\n88. **^** Birchard, Robert S.

Disney films are usually co-directed and some directors have served on several winning teams: Wilfred Jackson, Hamilton Luske, Clyde Geronimi, David Hand, Ben Sharpsteen, Wolfgang Reitherman and Bill Roberts have all co-directed at least two films on the list. Only seven directors have topped the chart in consecutive years: McCarey (1944 and 1945), Nichols (1966 and 1967), Spielberg (1981 and 1982), Jackson (2002 and 2003), Verbinski (2006 and 2007) and the Russo brothers (2018 and 2019).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBecause of the long-term effects of inflation, notably the significant increase of movie theater ticket prices, the list unadjusted for inflation gives far more weight to later films.[22] The unadjusted list, while commonly found in the press, is therefore largely meaningless for comparing films widely separated in time, as many films from earlier eras will never appear on a modern unadjusted list, despite achieving higher commercial success when adjusted for price increases.[23] To compensate for the devaluation of the currency, some charts make adjustments for inflation, but not even this practice fully addresses the issue, since ticket prices and inflation do not necessarily parallel one another. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* \"Frozen (2013) – International Box Office Results: Germany\". *Box Office Mojo*.

During the silent era, films with war themes were popular with audiences, with *The Birth of a Nation* (American Civil War), *The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse*, *The Big Parade* and *Wings* (all World War I) becoming the most successful films in their respective years of release, with the trend coming to an end with *All Quiet on the Western Front* in 1930. With the advent of sound in 1927, the musical—the genre best placed to showcase the new technology—took over as the most popular type of film with audiences, with 1928 and 1929 both being topped by musical films. The genre continued to perform strongly in the 1930s, but the outbreak of World War II saw war-themed films dominate again during this period, starting with *Gone with the Wind* (American Civil War) in 1939, and finishing with *The Best Years of Our Lives* (World War II) in 1946. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* 2018 re-release: \"2001: A Space Odyssey (2018 re-release)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

One notable example of this phenomenon is *Avatar*, which was also released in 3D and IMAX: almost two-thirds of tickets for that film were for 3D showings with an average price of $10, and about one-sixth were for IMAX showings with an average price over $14.50, compared to a 2010 average price of $7.61 for 2D films.[25] Social and economic factors such as population change[26] and the growth of international markets[27][28][29] also have an effect on the number of people purchasing theater tickets, along with audience demographics where some films sell a much higher proportion of discounted children's tickets, or perform better in big cities where tickets cost more.[23]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMD*Mom and Dad* does not generally feature in 'high-gross' lists such as those published by *Variety* due to its independent distribution. Essentially belonging to the exploitation genre, it was marketed as an educational sex hygiene film in an effort to circumvent censorship laws. Falling foul of the Motion Picture Production Code, *Mom and Dad* was prevented from obtaining mainstream distribution and restricted to independent and drive-in theaters. It was the biggest hit of its kind, and remained in continual distribution until the 1970s when hardcore pornography eventually took over. At the end of 1947 it had earned $2 million, and by 1949, $8 million; by 1956 it had earned $22 million in rentals, representing a gross of $80 million, and would have easily placed in the top ten films in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Estimates of its total earnings are as high as $100 million.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* *Way Down East*: p. 52 Archived April 4, 2023, at the Wayback Machine. \"D.W. Griffith's *Way Down East* (1920) was projected to return rentals of $4,000,000 on an $800,000 negative. This figure was based on the amounts earned from its roadshow run, coupled with its playoff in the rest of the country's theaters. Griffith had originally placed the potential film rental at $3,000,000 but, because of the success of the various roadshows that were running the $4,000,000 total was expected. The film showed a profit of $615,736 after just 23 weeks of release on a gross of $2,179,613.\"\n\t* *What Price Glory?*: p. 112 Archived April 4, 2023, at the Wayback Machine. \"What Price Glory hit the jackpot with massive world rentals of $2,429,000, the highest figure in the history of the company.

The actual figure is hard to calculate because the film was distributed on a \"states' rights\" basis in which licenses to show the film were sold outright.

It was the most popular film of the year (from any studio) in both North America and Britain, and its foreign earnings were three times higher than those of any other MGM film released in the 1941–42 season. The production cost ($1,344,000) was one of the highest of the season, indicating the studio never thought of the film as a potential loss-maker.
