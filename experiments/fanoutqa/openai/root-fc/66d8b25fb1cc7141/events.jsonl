The 81st annual edition of the tournament began on March 19, 2019, and concluded with the championship game on April 8 at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, Minnesota, between the Texas Tech Red Raiders and the Virginia Cavaliers, with Virginia winning 85–77 in overtime.[1][2]\n\n\nTwo schools made their first appearances in the tournament: Big South champion Gardner–Webb and Southland champion Abilene Christian.\n\n\nFor the first time since 2001, no #8 seed survived the first round of the tournament. This was also the first time since the First Four was established in 2011 that no team in the First Four advanced past the first round of the tournament.[a] As of the conclusion of the 2023 tournament, this is the only Final Four since 2012 that did not include at least one team seeded #7 or higher. [3] [4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12]\n\n\nThis tournament marked the first time that the Auburn Tigers of the Southeastern Conference and the Texas Tech Red Raiders of the Big 12 Conference made the Final Four. This also marked the third Final Four appearance for the Virginia Cavaliers of the Atlantic Coast Conference, but their first since 1984.\n\n\nThe 2019 tournament was the first since 1979 to see two first-time Final Four participants, and the first since 2006 to have a first-time national champion.[13] As a result of a worldwide COVID-19 pandemic that started in late 2019 and subsequently forced the cancellation of the 2020 tournament, this would be the last tournament held until 2021, and this would be also the last tournament held across the United States until 2022.\n\n\nCarsen Edwards of Purdue was the leading scorer, with 139 points in only 4 games–producing an average of 34.8 points per game. Edwards also set the record for most made 3-point shots in a tournament, with 28. The previous record holder, Glen Rice of Michigan in 1989, made 27, but did so in 6 games.\n\n\nIn the previous year's tournament, Virginia had infamously become the first No. 1 seed to lose to a No. 16 seed. At the conclusion of this year's title game, CBS announcer Jim Nantz dubbed Virginia's win the \"all-time turnaround title.\"[14]\n\n\n\n\n## Tournament procedure[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship § Tournament format\n\nA total of 68 teams entered the 2019 tournament. 32 automatic bids were awarded to each program that won their conference's tournament. The remaining 36 bids were \"at-large\", with selections extended by the NCAA Selection Committee.\n\n\nEight teams (the four lowest-seeded automatic qualifiers and the four lowest-seeded at-large teams) played in the First Four (the successor to what had been popularly known as \"play-in games\" through the 2010 tournament). The winners of these games advanced to the main draw of the tournament.\n\n\nThe Selection Committee seeded the entire field from 1 to 68.\n\n\nThe selections and seedings were completed and revealed on Sunday, March 17.\n\n\n\n## Schedule and venues[edit]\n\n\n![2019 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament is located in the United States](image)![Dayton](image)\nDayton\n![Hartford](image)\nHartford\n![Salt Lake City](image)\nSalt Lake City\n![Des Moines](image)\nDes Moines\n![Jacksonville](image)\nJacksonville\n![Tulsa](image)\nTulsa\n![Columbus](image)\nColumbus\n![Columbia](image)\nColumbia\n![San Jose](image)\nSan Jose\nclass=notpageimage|\n2019 First Four (orange) and first and second rounds (green)\n\n![2019 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament is located in the United States](image)![Louisville](image)\nLouisville\n![Anaheim](image)\nAnaheim\n![Washington, D.C.](image)\nWashington, D.C.\n![Kansas City](image)\nKansas City\n![Minneapolis](image)\nMinneapolis\nclass=notpageimage|\n2019 Regionals (blue) and Final Four (red)\n\nThe following are the sites that were selected to host each round of the 2019 tournament:[15]\n\n\n**First Four**\n\n\n\n* March 19 and 20\n\t+ University of Dayton Arena, Dayton, Ohio (Host: University of Dayton)\n\n\n**First and Second Rounds (Subregionals)**\n\n\n\n* March 21 and 23\n\t+ **East and West Region**\n\t+ XL Center, Hartford, Connecticut (Host: University of Connecticut)\n\t+ Wells Fargo Arena, Des Moines, Iowa (Host: Drake University)\n\t+ VyStar Veterans Memorial Arena, Jacksonville, Florida (Host: Jacksonville University)\n\t+ Vivint Smart Home Arena, Salt Lake City, Utah (Host: University of Utah)\n* March 22 and 24\n\t+ **South and Midwest Region**\n\t+ Colonial Life Arena, Columbia, South Carolina (Host: University of South Carolina)\n\t+ Nationwide Arena, Columbus, Ohio (Host: Ohio State University)\n\t+ BOK Center, Tulsa, Oklahoma (Host: University of Tulsa)\n\t+ SAP Center, San Jose, California (Host: West Coast Conference)\n\n\n**Regional semifinals and finals** (Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight)\n\n\n\n* March 28 and 30\n\t+ **West Regional**, Honda Center, Anaheim, California (Host: Big West Conference)\n\t+ **South Regional**, KFC Yum!

CNN president Jeff Zucker, who had also become head of WarnerMedia's sports properties after a reorganization, explained that \"it's a sign of understanding when things don't necessarily go as well as you would hope you change it. So there's no shame in that. At the end of the day, you have to give the fans what they want.\"[24] The show attracted its highest viewership since 2014 and averaged a 4.0 share on Nielsen overnight ratings.[25]\n\n\n\n#### Television channels[edit]\n\n\n* First Four – truTV\n* First and Second rounds – CBS, TBS, TNT, and truTV\n* Regional semifinals and finals (Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight) – CBS and TBS\n* National semifinals (Final Four) and championship – CBS\n\n\n#### Studio hosts[edit]\n\n\n* Greg Gumbel (New York City and Minneapolis) – First round, second round, Regionals, Final Four and National Championship Game\n* Ernie Johnson (New York City, Atlanta, and Minneapolis) – First round, second round, Regional Semi-Finals, Final Four and National Championship Game\n* Casey Stern (Atlanta) – First Four, first round and Second Round\n* Adam Zucker (New York) – First round and second round (game breaks)\n\n\n#### Studio analysts[edit]\n\n\n* Charles Barkley (New York City and Minneapolis) – First round, second round, Regionals, Final Four and National Championship Game\n* Mike Brey (Atlanta) – Regional Semi-Finals\n* Jeff Capel (Atlanta) – First round\n* Seth Davis (Atlanta and Minneapolis) – First Four, first round, second round, Regional Semi-Finals, Final Four and National Championship Game\n* Brendan Haywood (Atlanta) – First Four, first round, second round and Regional Semi-Finals\n* Clark Kellogg (New York City and Minneapolis) – First round, second round, Regionals, Final Four and National Championship Game\n* Porter Moser (Atlanta) – Second Round\n* Candace Parker (Atlanta and Minneapolis) – First Four, first round, second round, Regional Semi-Finals and Final Four\n* Kenny Smith (New York City and Minneapolis) – First round, second round, Regionals, Final Four and National Championship Game\n* Gene Steratore (New York City and Minneapolis) (Rules Analyst) – First Four, first round, second round, Regionals, Final Four and National Championship Game\n* Wally Szczerbiak (New York City and Minneapolis) – Second Round and Final Four\n* Jay Wright (Minneapolis) – Final Four\n\n\n#### Commentary teams[edit]\n\n\n* Jim Nantz/Bill Raftery/Grant Hill/Tracy Wolfson – First and Second Rounds at Columbia, South Carolina; East Regional at Washington, D.C.; Final Four and National Championship at Minneapolis, Minnesota\n* Brian Anderson/Chris Webber/Allie LaForce – First and Second Rounds at Columbus, Ohio; South Regional at Louisville, Kentucky\n* Ian Eagle/Jim Spanarkel/Jamie Erdahl – First and Second Rounds at Jacksonville, Florida; Midwest Regional at Kansas City, Missouri\n* Kevin Harlan/Reggie Miller/Dan Bonner/Dana Jacobson – First Four at Dayton, Ohio (Tuesday); First and Second Rounds at Des Moines, Iowa; West Regional at Anaheim, California\n* Brad Nessler/Steve Lavin/Jim Jackson/Evan Washburn – First and Second Rounds at Tulsa, Oklahoma\n* Spero Dedes/Steve Smith/Len Elmore or Jim Jackson/Rosalyn Gold-Onwude – First Four at Dayton, Ohio (Wednesday); First and Second Rounds at San Jose, California\n\t+ Jackson called the First Four (Wednesday) with Elmore doing the First and Second Rounds with Dedes, Smith and Gold-Onwude.\n* Andrew Catalon/Steve Lappas/Lisa Byington – First and Second Rounds at Salt Lake City, Utah\n* Carter Blackburn/Debbie Antonelli/John Schriffen – First and Second Rounds at Hartford, Connecticut\n\n\nESPN International had international rights to the tournament.

The 81st annual edition of the tournament began on March 19, 2019, and concluded with the championship game on April 8 at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, Minnesota, between the Texas Tech Red Raiders and the Virginia Cavaliers, with Virginia winning 85–77 in overtime.[1][2]\n\n\nTwo schools made their first appearances in the tournament: Big South champion Gardner–Webb and Southland champion Abilene Christian.\n\n\nFor the first time since 2001, no #8 seed survived the first round of the tournament. This was also the first time since the First Four was established in 2011 that no team in the First Four advanced past the first round of the tournament.[a] As of the conclusion of the 2023 tournament, this is the only Final Four since 2012 that did not include at least one team seeded #7 or higher. [3] [4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12]\n\n\nThis tournament marked the first time that the Auburn Tigers of the Southeastern Conference and the Texas Tech Red Raiders of the Big 12 Conference made the Final Four. This also marked the third Final Four appearance for the Virginia Cavaliers of the Atlantic Coast Conference, but their first since 1984.\n\n\nThe 2019 tournament was the first since 1979 to see two first-time Final Four participants, and the first since 2006 to have a first-time national champion.[13] As a result of a worldwide COVID-19 pandemic that started in late 2019 and subsequently forced the cancellation of the 2020 tournament, this would be the last tournament held until 2021, and this would be also the last tournament held across the United States until 2022.\n\n\nCarsen Edwards of Purdue was the leading scorer, with 139 points in only 4 games–producing an average of 34.8 points per game. Edwards also set the record for most made 3-point shots in a tournament, with 28. The previous record holder, Glen Rice of Michigan in 1989, made 27, but did so in 6 games.\n\n\nIn the previous year's tournament, Virginia had infamously become the first No. 1 seed to lose to a No. 16 seed. At the conclusion of this year's title game, CBS announcer Jim Nantz dubbed Virginia's win the \"all-time turnaround title.\"[14]\n\n\n\n\n## Tournament procedure[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship § Tournament format\n\nA total of 68 teams entered the 2019 tournament. 32 automatic bids were awarded to each program that won their conference's tournament. The remaining 36 bids were \"at-large\", with selections extended by the NCAA Selection Committee.\n\n\nEight teams (the four lowest-seeded automatic qualifiers and the four lowest-seeded at-large teams) played in the First Four (the successor to what had been popularly known as \"play-in games\" through the 2010 tournament). The winners of these games advanced to the main draw of the tournament.\n\n\nThe Selection Committee seeded the entire field from 1 to 68.\n\n\nThe selections and seedings were completed and revealed on Sunday, March 17.\n\n\n\n## Schedule and venues[edit]\n\n\n![2019 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament is located in the United States](image)![Dayton](image)\nDayton\n![Hartford](image)\nHartford\n![Salt Lake City](image)\nSalt Lake City\n![Des Moines](image)\nDes Moines\n![Jacksonville](image)\nJacksonville\n![Tulsa](image)\nTulsa\n![Columbus](image)\nColumbus\n![Columbia](image)\nColumbia\n![San Jose](image)\nSan Jose\nclass=notpageimage|\n2019 First Four (orange) and first and second rounds (green)\n\n![2019 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament is located in the United States](image)![Louisville](image)\nLouisville\n![Anaheim](image)\nAnaheim\n![Washington, D.C.](image)\nWashington, D.C.\n![Kansas City](image)\nKansas City\n![Minneapolis](image)\nMinneapolis\nclass=notpageimage|\n2019 Regionals (blue) and Final Four (red)\n\nThe following are the sites that were selected to host each round of the 2019 tournament:[15]\n\n\n**First Four**\n\n\n\n* March 19 and 20\n\t+ University of Dayton Arena, Dayton, Ohio (Host: University of Dayton)\n\n\n**First and Second Rounds (Subregionals)**\n\n\n\n* March 21 and 23\n\t+ **East and West Region**\n\t+ XL Center, Hartford, Connecticut (Host: University of Connecticut)\n\t+ Wells Fargo Arena, Des Moines, Iowa (Host: Drake University)\n\t+ VyStar Veterans Memorial Arena, Jacksonville, Florida (Host: Jacksonville University)\n\t+ Vivint Smart Home Arena, Salt Lake City, Utah (Host: University of Utah)\n* March 22 and 24\n\t+ **South and Midwest Region**\n\t+ Colonial Life Arena, Columbia, South Carolina (Host: University of South Carolina)\n\t+ Nationwide Arena, Columbus, Ohio (Host: Ohio State University)\n\t+ BOK Center, Tulsa, Oklahoma (Host: University of Tulsa)\n\t+ SAP Center, San Jose, California (Host: West Coast Conference)\n\n\n**Regional semifinals and finals** (Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight)\n\n\n\n* March 28 and 30\n\t+ **West Regional**, Honda Center, Anaheim, California (Host: Big West Conference)\n\t+ **South Regional**, KFC Yum!

CNN president Jeff Zucker, who had also become head of WarnerMedia's sports properties after a reorganization, explained that \"it's a sign of understanding when things don't necessarily go as well as you would hope you change it. So there's no shame in that. At the end of the day, you have to give the fans what they want.\"[24] The show attracted its highest viewership since 2014 and averaged a 4.0 share on Nielsen overnight ratings.[25]\n\n\n\n#### Television channels[edit]\n\n\n* First Four – truTV\n* First and Second rounds – CBS, TBS, TNT, and truTV\n* Regional semifinals and finals (Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight) – CBS and TBS\n* National semifinals (Final Four) and championship – CBS\n\n\n#### Studio hosts[edit]\n\n\n* Greg Gumbel (New York City and Minneapolis) – First round, second round, Regionals, Final Four and National Championship Game\n* Ernie Johnson (New York City, Atlanta, and Minneapolis) – First round, second round, Regional Semi-Finals, Final Four and National Championship Game\n* Casey Stern (Atlanta) – First Four, first round and Second Round\n* Adam Zucker (New York) – First round and second round (game breaks)\n\n\n#### Studio analysts[edit]\n\n\n* Charles Barkley (New York City and Minneapolis) – First round, second round, Regionals, Final Four and National Championship Game\n* Mike Brey (Atlanta) – Regional Semi-Finals\n* Jeff Capel (Atlanta) – First round\n* Seth Davis (Atlanta and Minneapolis) – First Four, first round, second round, Regional Semi-Finals, Final Four and National Championship Game\n* Brendan Haywood (Atlanta) – First Four, first round, second round and Regional Semi-Finals\n* Clark Kellogg (New York City and Minneapolis) – First round, second round, Regionals, Final Four and National Championship Game\n* Porter Moser (Atlanta) – Second Round\n* Candace Parker (Atlanta and Minneapolis) – First Four, first round, second round, Regional Semi-Finals and Final Four\n* Kenny Smith (New York City and Minneapolis) – First round, second round, Regionals, Final Four and National Championship Game\n* Gene Steratore (New York City and Minneapolis) (Rules Analyst) – First Four, first round, second round, Regionals, Final Four and National Championship Game\n* Wally Szczerbiak (New York City and Minneapolis) – Second Round and Final Four\n* Jay Wright (Minneapolis) – Final Four\n\n\n#### Commentary teams[edit]\n\n\n* Jim Nantz/Bill Raftery/Grant Hill/Tracy Wolfson – First and Second Rounds at Columbia, South Carolina; East Regional at Washington, D.C.; Final Four and National Championship at Minneapolis, Minnesota\n* Brian Anderson/Chris Webber/Allie LaForce – First and Second Rounds at Columbus, Ohio; South Regional at Louisville, Kentucky\n* Ian Eagle/Jim Spanarkel/Jamie Erdahl – First and Second Rounds at Jacksonville, Florida; Midwest Regional at Kansas City, Missouri\n* Kevin Harlan/Reggie Miller/Dan Bonner/Dana Jacobson – First Four at Dayton, Ohio (Tuesday); First and Second Rounds at Des Moines, Iowa; West Regional at Anaheim, California\n* Brad Nessler/Steve Lavin/Jim Jackson/Evan Washburn – First and Second Rounds at Tulsa, Oklahoma\n* Spero Dedes/Steve Smith/Len Elmore or Jim Jackson/Rosalyn Gold-Onwude – First Four at Dayton, Ohio (Wednesday); First and Second Rounds at San Jose, California\n\t+ Jackson called the First Four (Wednesday) with Elmore doing the First and Second Rounds with Dedes, Smith and Gold-Onwude.\n* Andrew Catalon/Steve Lappas/Lisa Byington – First and Second Rounds at Salt Lake City, Utah\n* Carter Blackburn/Debbie Antonelli/John Schriffen – First and Second Rounds at Hartford, Connecticut\n\n\nESPN International had international rights to the tournament.

The 82nd edition of the tournament began play on March 18, 2021 in sites around the state of Indiana,[1] and concluded with the championship game at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis on April 5, with the Baylor Bears defeating the previously undefeated Gonzaga Bulldogs 86–70 to earn the team's first ever title.\n\n\nFor logistical considerations surrounding the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (which resulted in the cancellation of the previous year's tournament), the NCAA announced in January 2021 that all tournament games would be held in Indiana rather than at sites across the country. This was the only time in the history of the tournament that a single state has hosted it in its entirety.[2]\n\n\nThis marked the first time since 1976 that neither Duke nor Kentucky qualified for the tournament.[3] It was also the first time since 1995 that Duke failed to make the tournament, breaking a streak of 24 consecutive appearances. America East champion Hartford and WAC champion Grand Canyon made their NCAA Tournament debuts.\n\n\nThe tournament was marked by many upsets, with Yahoo Sports journalist Pete Thamel calling it \"one of the most dizzying NCAA men's tournaments in history\". With only half of the 16 second-round games having been played, there had been 11 upsets to that point, using the NCAA's definition of \"upset\" as a win by a team seeded five or more lines below its defeated opponent. This had already broken the record for most upsets prior to the round of 16; by the end of the second round, this number went up to 12. In addition, at least one 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15 seed won a first-round game for the fourth time ever, and the first time since 2016. Also, a record four teams seeded 13 or lower won first-round games.[4] Another notable mark set during the tournament was a record-breaking 14 upsets throughout the event, breaking the original record of 13 upsets from the 1985 and 2014 tournaments.\n\n\nThe Final Four game between UCLA and Gonzaga (the first semifinal game to go into overtime since 1998) saw a game-winning buzzer-beater by Jalen Suggs to take Gonzaga into the championship game, the first buzzer-beater in a national semifinal since 1977. By defeating Gonzaga in the championship game, the Baylor Bears became the second consecutive first-time NCAA champions, following the Virginia Cavaliers in 2019. The last time this happened was in 2002 and 2003, when the Maryland Terrapins and Syracuse Orange (then nicknamed Orangemen) won their first titles in their respective years. Baylor also joined Texas Western (now known as the University of Texas at El Paso) as the only two teams from the state of Texas to have won an NCAA Division I Basketball championship, the Miners having done so in 1966.\n\n\n\n\n## Tournament procedure[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament § Current tournament format\n\nA total of 68 teams entered the 2021 tournament, with 31 of them (down from 32, due to the Ivy League having canceled all winter semester sports due to COVID-19)[5] having received an automatic bid by winning their conference's tournament. The remaining 37 bids were \"at-large\", with selections extended by the NCAA Selection Committee. Teams met sport sponsorship requirements and were considered for NCAA championship selection if they played 13 games, which represented a 50 percent reduction of the current minimum. For NCAA championship consideration, all 13 games had to be against other Division I opponents. Teams could also play 12 regular-season games against Division I opponents and one conference tournament game to be eligible for tournament consideration.[6]\n\n\nThe Selection Committee seeded the entire field from 1 to 68. The four lowest-seeded automatic qualifiers and the four lowest-seeded at-large teams played in the First Four round: for the 2021 tournament, the games were played between the overall 65th and 66th seeds, the 67th and 68th seed, and the last four at-large seeds.[7]\n\n\nThe top four teams outside of the ranking (commonly known as the \"first four out\" in pre-tourney analyses) acted as standbys in the event a school was forced to withdraw from the tournament due to COVID-19 protocols.[8][9] However, if a team withdrew within 48 hours of the tournament's commencement, they would not be replaced; the bracket was not reseeded, and the affected team's opponent would automatically advance to the next round.The replacement teams are as follows, in order: \n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Four Out[10]\n| NET | School\n | Conference\n | Record\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 56\n | Louisville | ACC | 13–7\n |\n| 51\n | Colorado State | Mountain West | 18–6\n |\n| 43\n | Saint Louis | Atlantic 10 | 14–6\n |\n| 53\n | Ole Miss | SEC | 16–11\n |\n\n\n[11]\n\n\n\n## Schedule and venues[edit]\n\n\n![Map](image)2021 NCAA tournament venues\n\n![](image)Gonzaga vs. University of Southern California at Lucas Oil Stadium\nOn January 4, 2021, the NCAA announced that due to logistical considerations associated with the COVID-19 pandemic (which prompted the cancellation of the 2020 tournament), the entirety of the tournament would be conducted at sites within the Indianapolis metro area and central Indiana, rather than across the country.[12] Players stayed at hotels near the Indiana Convention Center, which served as the main practice facility.[13] Lucas Oil Stadium had two courts named \"Unity Court\" and \"Equality Court\" during the First Round, Second Round, and Elite Eight.\n\n\nOn February 19, it was announced that all venues would operate at a maximum of 25% capacity. As this capacity includes staff and players, the exact number of spectators varied by venue.[14][15] Artificial crowd noise was used at all venues to augment the limited in-person attendance.[16]\n\n\nThis tournament marked the first time ever that Indiana Farmers Coliseum was a tournament venue, the first time since 2017 that Bankers Life Fieldhouse was a tournament venue, the first time since 1940 that Hinkle Fieldhouse was a tournament venue, the first time since 1980 that Mackey Arena was a tournament venue, and the first time since 1981 that Assembly Hall was a

determined through the NCAA basketball tournament selection process.\n\n\nIn contrast to previous years, the S-Curve used to establish overall seeds will also be used as primary determinant of the tournament bracket; this was made possible by the relatively condensed locations of this year's tournament making geographic concerns irrelevant. However, rules that can modify pairings to avoid early rematches and to distribute top conference representatives to different regions will remain in effect.[18][19]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

The 82nd edition of the tournament began play on March 18, 2021 in sites around the state of Indiana,[1] and concluded with the championship game at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis on April 5, with the Baylor Bears defeating the previously undefeated Gonzaga Bulldogs 86–70 to earn the team's first ever title.\n\n\nFor logistical considerations surrounding the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (which resulted in the cancellation of the previous year's tournament), the NCAA announced in January 2021 that all tournament games would be held in Indiana rather than at sites across the country. This was the only time in the history of the tournament that a single state has hosted it in its entirety.[2]\n\n\nThis marked the first time since 1976 that neither Duke nor Kentucky qualified for the tournament.[3] It was also the first time since 1995 that Duke failed to make the tournament, breaking a streak of 24 consecutive appearances. America East champion Hartford and WAC champion Grand Canyon made their NCAA Tournament debuts.\n\n\nThe tournament was marked by many upsets, with Yahoo Sports journalist Pete Thamel calling it \"one of the most dizzying NCAA men's tournaments in history\". With only half of the 16 second-round games having been played, there had been 11 upsets to that point, using the NCAA's definition of \"upset\" as a win by a team seeded five or more lines below its defeated opponent. This had already broken the record for most upsets prior to the round of 16; by the end of the second round, this number went up to 12. In addition, at least one 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15 seed won a first-round game for the fourth time ever, and the first time since 2016. Also, a record four teams seeded 13 or lower won first-round games.[4] Another notable mark set during the tournament was a record-breaking 14 upsets throughout the event, breaking the original record of 13 upsets from the 1985 and 2014 tournaments.\n\n\nThe Final Four game between UCLA and Gonzaga (the first semifinal game to go into overtime since 1998) saw a game-winning buzzer-beater by Jalen Suggs to take Gonzaga into the championship game, the first buzzer-beater in a national semifinal since 1977. By defeating Gonzaga in the championship game, the Baylor Bears became the second consecutive first-time NCAA champions, following the Virginia Cavaliers in 2019. The last time this happened was in 2002 and 2003, when the Maryland Terrapins and Syracuse Orange (then nicknamed Orangemen) won their first titles in their respective years. Baylor also joined Texas Western (now known as the University of Texas at El Paso) as the only two teams from the state of Texas to have won an NCAA Division I Basketball championship, the Miners having done so in 1966.\n\n\n\n\n## Tournament procedure[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament § Current tournament format\n\nA total of 68 teams entered the 2021 tournament, with 31 of them (down from 32, due to the Ivy League having canceled all winter semester sports due to COVID-19)[5] having received an automatic bid by winning their conference's tournament. The remaining 37 bids were \"at-large\", with selections extended by the NCAA Selection Committee. Teams met sport sponsorship requirements and were considered for NCAA championship selection if they played 13 games, which represented a 50 percent reduction of the current minimum. For NCAA championship consideration, all 13 games had to be against other Division I opponents. Teams could also play 12 regular-season games against Division I opponents and one conference tournament game to be eligible for tournament consideration.[6]\n\n\nThe Selection Committee seeded the entire field from 1 to 68. The four lowest-seeded automatic qualifiers and the four lowest-seeded at-large teams played in the First Four round: for the 2021 tournament, the games were played between the overall 65th and 66th seeds, the 67th and 68th seed, and the last four at-large seeds.[7]\n\n\nThe top four teams outside of the ranking (commonly known as the \"first four out\" in pre-tourney analyses) acted as standbys in the event a school was forced to withdraw from the tournament due to COVID-19 protocols.[8][9] However, if a team withdrew within 48 hours of the tournament's commencement, they would not be replaced; the bracket was not reseeded, and the affected team's opponent would automatically advance to the next round.The replacement teams are as follows, in order: \n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Four Out[10]\n| NET | School\n | Conference\n | Record\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 56\n | Louisville | ACC | 13–7\n |\n| 51\n | Colorado State | Mountain West | 18–6\n |\n| 43\n | Saint Louis | Atlantic 10 | 14–6\n |\n| 53\n | Ole Miss | SEC | 16–11\n |\n\n\n[11]\n\n\n\n## Schedule and venues[edit]\n\n\n![Map](image)2021 NCAA tournament venues\n\n![](image)Gonzaga vs. University of Southern California at Lucas Oil Stadium\nOn January 4, 2021, the NCAA announced that due to logistical considerations associated with the COVID-19 pandemic (which prompted the cancellation of the 2020 tournament), the entirety of the tournament would be conducted at sites within the Indianapolis metro area and central Indiana, rather than across the country.[12] Players stayed at hotels near the Indiana Convention Center, which served as the main practice facility.[13] Lucas Oil Stadium had two courts named \"Unity Court\" and \"Equality Court\" during the First Round, Second Round, and Elite Eight.\n\n\nOn February 19, it was announced that all venues would operate at a maximum of 25% capacity. As this capacity includes staff and players, the exact number of spectators varied by venue.[14][15] Artificial crowd noise was used at all venues to augment the limited in-person attendance.[16]\n\n\nThis tournament marked the first time ever that Indiana Farmers Coliseum was a tournament venue, the first time since 2017 that Bankers Life Fieldhouse was a tournament venue, the first time since 1940 that Hinkle Fieldhouse was a tournament venue, the first time since 1980 that Mackey Arena was a tournament venue, and the first time since 1981 that Assembly Hall was a

determined through the NCAA basketball tournament selection process.\n\n\nIn contrast to previous years, the S-Curve used to establish overall seeds will also be used as primary determinant of the tournament bracket; this was made possible by the relatively condensed locations of this year's tournament making geographic concerns irrelevant. However, rules that can modify pairings to avoid early rematches and to distribute top conference representatives to different regions will remain in effect.[18][19]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

The 83rd annual edition of the tournament began on March 15, 2022, and concluded with the championship game on April 4 at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana, with the Kansas Jayhawks defeating the North Carolina Tar Heels, 72–69, overcoming a 16-point first-half deficit (the largest deficit overcome in championship game history), to claim the school’s fourth national title. \n\n\nBig South Conference champion Longwood and Northeast Conference (NEC) champion Bryant made their tournament debuts. Bryant was eliminated in the First Four by Wright State, and Longwood was eliminated by Tennessee in the first round.\n\n\nA major upset occurred on the first full day of the tournament, when 15-seed Saint Peter's upset 2-seed Kentucky, and subsequently became the third 15-seed to reach the Sweet 16 (the second consecutive year in which this occurred and third in the last nine years) and the first ever 15-seed to advance to the Elite Eight.[1] This was the tenth time a 15-seed defeated a 2-seed overall, but it was the sixth time since 2012 this occurred. The defending champions Baylor were defeated by North Carolina in the second round, ensuring the defending champion and at least one top seed was eliminated before the regional semifinals for the fifth consecutive tournament, and at least one double-digit seed (this year, four: 15-seed Saint Peter's, 11-seeds Michigan and Iowa State, and 10-seed Miami) made the Sweet 16 for the 15th straight tournament. Also, when Kansas defeated Providence in the Sweet 16, the Jayhawks passed Kentucky for the most all time wins by a Division I program, with 2,354.\n\n\n\n\n## Tournament procedure[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament § Current tournament format\n\nA total of 68 teams have been entered into the 2022 tournament. A total of 32 automatic bids were awarded to each program that won a conference tournament (with one exception, as the tournament winner in the ASUN Conference was ineligible, due to its transition from Division II). The remaining 36 bids were issued \"at-large\", with selections extended by the NCAA Selection Committee. The Selection Committee also seeded the entire field from 1 to 68.\n\n\nEight teams (the four lowest-seeded automatic qualifiers and the four lowest-seeded at-large teams) played in the First Four. The winners of these games advanced to the main bracket of the tournament.\n\n\nThe top four teams outside of the ranking (commonly known as the \"first four out\" in pre-tournament analyses) acted as standbys in the event a school is forced to withdraw before the start of the tournament due to COVID-19 protocols. Any recipient of an automatic bid would designate a replacement from within their own conference if they need to withdraw. Otherwise, the replacement teams were as follows, in order: \n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Four Out[2]\n| NET | School\n | Conference\n | Record\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 58\n | Dayton | Atlantic 10 |

not be replaced; the bracket will not be reseeded, and the affected team's opponent will automatically advance to the next round.\n\n\n\n## 2022 NCAA Tournament schedule and venues[edit]\n\n\n![2022

The 83rd annual edition of the tournament began on March 15, 2022, and concluded with the championship game on April 4 at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana, with the Kansas Jayhawks defeating the North Carolina Tar Heels, 72–69, overcoming a 16-point first-half deficit (the largest deficit overcome in championship game history), to claim the school’s fourth national title. \n\n\nBig South Conference champion Longwood and Northeast Conference (NEC) champion Bryant made their tournament debuts. Bryant was eliminated in the First Four by Wright State, and Longwood was eliminated by Tennessee in the first round.\n\n\nA major upset occurred on the first full day of the tournament, when 15-seed Saint Peter's upset 2-seed Kentucky, and subsequently became the third 15-seed to reach the Sweet 16 (the second consecutive year in which this occurred and third in the last nine years) and the first ever 15-seed to advance to the Elite Eight.[1] This was the tenth time a 15-seed defeated a 2-seed overall, but it was the sixth time since 2012 this occurred. The defending champions Baylor were defeated by North Carolina in the second round, ensuring the defending champion and at least one top seed was eliminated before the regional semifinals for the fifth consecutive tournament, and at least one double-digit seed (this year, four: 15-seed Saint Peter's, 11-seeds Michigan and Iowa State, and 10-seed Miami) made the Sweet 16 for the 15th straight tournament. Also, when Kansas defeated Providence in the Sweet 16, the Jayhawks passed Kentucky for the most all time wins by a Division I program, with 2,354.\n\n\n\n\n## Tournament procedure[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament § Current tournament format\n\nA total of 68 teams have been entered into the 2022 tournament. A total of 32 automatic bids were awarded to each program that won a conference tournament (with one exception, as the tournament winner in the ASUN Conference was ineligible, due to its transition from Division II). The remaining 36 bids were issued \"at-large\", with selections extended by the NCAA Selection Committee. The Selection Committee also seeded the entire field from 1 to 68.\n\n\nEight teams (the four lowest-seeded automatic qualifiers and the four lowest-seeded at-large teams) played in the First Four. The winners of these games advanced to the main bracket of the tournament.\n\n\nThe top four teams outside of the ranking (commonly known as the \"first four out\" in pre-tournament analyses) acted as standbys in the event a school is forced to withdraw before the start of the tournament due to COVID-19 protocols. Any recipient of an automatic bid would designate a replacement from within their own conference if they need to withdraw. Otherwise, the replacement teams were as follows, in order: \n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Four Out[2]\n| NET | School\n | Conference\n | Record\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 58\n | Dayton | Atlantic 10 | 23–10\n |\n| 40\n | Oklahoma | Big 12 | 18–15\n |\n| 44\n | SMU | American | 23–8\n |\n| 42\n | Texas A&M | SEC | 23–12\n |\n\n\nOnce the tournament starts, any team that is forced to withdraw will not be replaced; the bracket will not be reseeded, and the affected team's opponent will automatically advance to the next round.\n\n\n\n## 2022 NCAA Tournament schedule and venues[edit]\n\n\n![2022

The 84th annual edition of the tournament began on March 14, 2023, and concluded with the UConn Huskies defeating the San Diego State Aztecs, 76–59 in the championship game on April 3 at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas.[1]\n\n\nASUN champion Kennesaw State made its NCAA tournament debut, while Southern Conference champion Furman made its first NCAA appearance since 1980. Another school, Texas Southern, won the SWAC tournament to tie the Coppin State Eagles in 2008 and Liberty Flames in 2013 for most losses ever to make the tournament, with 20.[2]\n\n\nFor only the second time in history, a 16-seed defeated a 1-seed, when Fairleigh Dickinson upset Purdue in the first round 63–58 in Columbus.[3] Coincidentally, much like the previous time a top seed lost in Round 1, the regional final was contested between a mid-major (in this case Florida Atlantic) and Kansas State.\n\n\nFor the third consecutive year, and seventh time since 2012, a 15-seed defeated a 2-seed in the tournament. This time, 15-seed Princeton upset 2-seed Arizona 59–55 in Sacramento for the Tigers' first tournament win since 1998. Arizona became the first team to lose to a 15-seed team twice, with the first loss being against the Santa Clara Broncos in 1993.[4] For the third consecutive year as well, a 15-seed reached the Sweet 16 as Princeton subsequently defeated Missouri in the second round, and making it 16 consecutive tournaments since 2007 where a double-digit seed made the regional semifinals.[5] Missouri subsequently became the second team to lose to a 15-seed twice, albeit on different seed lines, as the Tigers were a 7-seed losing to Princeton and a 2-seed when they fell to Norfolk State in 2012.\n\n\nAdditionally, Virginia was knocked out in the first round as a top-four seed for the third time in five years, and second straight time as a 4-seed when they were upset by 13-seed Furman.[6]\n\n\nThe defending national champions Kansas Jayhawks were eliminated in the second round, against the Arkansas Razorbacks. It was the sixth straight tournament where the defending champion failed to make the Sweet Sixteen.[7]\n\n\nWith Alabama and Houston's eliminations in the Sweet Sixteen, this marks the first ever NCAA Tournament where all top seeds in the regions were knocked out prior to the Elite Eight.[8] This year had the fewest combined 1- and 2-seeds left in the Elite Eight in tournament history, with only 2-seed Texas remaining.[9]\n\n\nThree teams made their first Final Four appearance in this tournament for the first time since 1970. The Florida Atlantic Owls defeated 3-seed Kansas State to become just the second 9-seed to advance to the Final Four since the tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985, joining Wichita State in 2013.[10] FAU also became the first team since George Mason in 2006 to make the Final Four in the same season that it earned its first NCAA tournament win.[11] The 5-seed San Diego State Aztecs defeated 6-seed Creighton Bluejays and the 5-seed Miami Hurricanes defeated 2-seed Texas Longhorns to advance to their first Final Four in program history. This is also the third Final Four without any 1-seeds since the tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985, with the first two being in 2006 and 2011, the second time without any 1 or 2 seeds (2011), and the first time in Final Four history without any teams seeded 1–3. With FAU (Conference USA) and SDSU (Mountain West Conference), the Final Four had two mid-major teams for the first time since 2011's Butler and VCU. \n\n\nThe 2023 Final Four was also marked by its lack of highly touted high school prospects. For the first time since the NCAA began seeding the tournament in 1979, no former McDonald's All-American participated in the Final Four. Of the rotation players on the Final Four teams (those receiving regular playing time), the highest-ranked in the composite recruiting rankings of 247Sports was UConn's Jordan Hawkins, who was #51 in the 2021 class. Only eight rotation players in the Final Four were even ranked in the top 100; by contrast, 12 players were unranked in high school. Two teams, Florida Atlantic and San Diego State, had no top-100 players, with FAU's nine-man rotation featuring six unranked players and only one in the top 200.[12]\n\n\n\n\n## Procedures[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament § Tournament format\n\nA total of 68 teams participated in the tournament with 32 automatic bids being filled by each program that won its conference tournament. The remaining 36 bids were issued \"at-large\", with selections extended by the NCAA Selection Committee on Selection Sunday, March 12.[13] The Selection Committee also seeded the entire field from 1 to 68.\n\n\nEight teams (the four-lowest seeded automatic qualifiers and the four lowest-seeded at-large teams) played in the First Four. The winners of those games advanced to the main tournament bracket.\n\n\n\n## Schedule and venues[edit]\n\n\nThe following are the sites selected to host the each round of the 2023 tournament:[14]\n\n\n\n![2023 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament is located in the United States](image)![Dayton](image)\nDayton\n![Orlando](image)\nOrlando\n![Birmingham](image)\nBirmingham\n![Des Moines](image)\nDes Moines\n![Sacramento](image)\nSacramento\n![Albany](image)\nAlbany\n![Greensboro](image)\nGreensboro\n![Columbus](image)\nColumbus\n![Denver](image)\nDenver\nclass=notpageimage|\n2023 First Four (orange) and first and second rounds (green)\n\n![2023 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament is located in the United States](image)![New York](image)\nNew York\n![Las Vegas](image)\nLas Vegas\n![Louisville](image)\nLouisville\n![Kansas City](image)\nKansas City\n![Houston](image)\nHouston\nclass=notpageimage|\n2023 Regionals (blue) and **Final Four** (red)\n\n**First Four**\n\n\n\n* March 14 and 15\n\t+ University of Dayton Arena, Dayton, Ohio (Host: University of Dayton)\n\n\n**First and second rounds** (subregionals)\n\n\n\n* March 16 and 18\n\t+ Amway Center, Orlando, Florida (Host: University of Central Florida)\n\t+ Legacy Arena, Birmingham, Alabama (Host: Southeastern Conference)\n\t+ Wells Fargo Arena, Des Moines, Iowa (Host: Drake University)\n\t+ Golden 1 Center, Sacramento, California (Host: California State University, Sacramento)\n* March 17 and 19\n\t+ MVP Arena, Albany, New York (Hosts: Siena College, Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference)\n\t+ Greensboro Coliseum, Greensboro, North Carolina (Host: Atlantic Coast Conference)\n\t+ Nationwide Arena, Columbus, Ohio (Host: Ohio State University)\n\t+ Ball Arena, Denver, Colorado (Host: Mountain West Conference)\n\n\n**Regional semi-finals and finals (Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight)**\n\n\n\n* March 23 and 25\n\t+ **East regional**\n\t\t- Madison Square Garden, New York, New York (Hosts: Big East Conference, St. John's University)\n\t+ **West regional**\n\t\t- T-Mobile Arena, Las Vegas, Nevada (Host: University of Nevada, Las Vegas)\n* March 24 and 26\n\t+ **South regional**\n\t\t- KFC Yum!

The 84th annual edition of the tournament began on March 14, 2023, and concluded with the UConn Huskies defeating the San Diego State Aztecs, 76–59 in the championship game on April 3 at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas.[1]\n\n\nASUN champion Kennesaw State made its NCAA tournament debut, while Southern Conference champion Furman made its first NCAA appearance since 1980. Another school, Texas Southern, won the SWAC tournament to tie the Coppin State Eagles in 2008 and Liberty Flames in 2013 for most losses ever to make the tournament, with 20.[2]\n\n\nFor only the second time in history, a 16-seed defeated a 1-seed, when Fairleigh Dickinson upset Purdue in the first round 63–58 in Columbus.[3] Coincidentally, much like the previous time a top seed lost in Round 1, the regional final was contested between a mid-major (in this case Florida Atlantic) and Kansas State.\n\n\nFor the third consecutive year, and seventh time since 2012, a 15-seed defeated a 2-seed in the tournament. This time, 15-seed Princeton upset 2-seed Arizona 59–55 in Sacramento for the Tigers' first tournament win since 1998. Arizona became the first team to lose to a 15-seed team twice, with the first loss being against the Santa Clara Broncos in 1993.[4] For the third consecutive year as well, a 15-seed reached the Sweet 16 as Princeton subsequently defeated Missouri in the second round, and making it 16 consecutive tournaments since 2007 where a double-digit seed made the regional semifinals.[5] Missouri subsequently became the second team to lose to a 15-seed twice, albeit on different seed lines, as the Tigers were a 7-seed losing to Princeton and a 2-seed when they fell to Norfolk State in 2012.\n\n\nAdditionally, Virginia was knocked out in the first round as a top-four seed for the third time in five years, and second straight time as a 4-seed when they were upset by 13-seed Furman.[6]\n\n\nThe defending national champions Kansas Jayhawks were eliminated in the second round, against the Arkansas Razorbacks. It was the sixth straight tournament where the defending champion failed to make the Sweet Sixteen.[7]\n\n\nWith Alabama and Houston's eliminations in the Sweet Sixteen, this marks the first ever NCAA Tournament where all top seeds in the regions were knocked out prior to the Elite Eight.[8] This year had the fewest combined 1- and 2-seeds left in the Elite Eight in tournament history, with only 2-seed Texas remaining.[9]\n\n\nThree teams made their first Final Four appearance in this tournament for the first time since 1970. The Florida Atlantic Owls defeated 3-seed Kansas State to become just the second 9-seed to advance to the Final Four since the tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985, joining Wichita State in 2013.[10] FAU also became the first team since George Mason in 2006 to make the Final Four in the same season that it earned its first NCAA tournament win.[11] The 5-seed San Diego State Aztecs defeated 6-seed Creighton Bluejays and the 5-seed Miami Hurricanes defeated 2-seed Texas Longhorns to advance to their first Final Four in program history. This is also the third Final Four without any 1-seeds since the tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985, with the first two being in 2006 and 2011, the second time without any 1 or 2 seeds (2011), and the first time in Final Four history without any teams seeded 1–3. With FAU (Conference USA) and SDSU (Mountain West Conference), the Final Four had two mid-major teams for the first time since 2011's Butler and VCU. \n\n\nThe 2023 Final Four was also marked by its lack of highly touted high school prospects. For the first time since the NCAA began seeding the tournament in 1979, no former McDonald's All-American participated in the Final Four. Of the rotation players on the Final Four teams (those receiving regular playing time), the highest-ranked in the composite recruiting rankings of 247Sports was UConn's Jordan Hawkins, who was #51 in the 2021 class. Only eight rotation players in the Final Four were even ranked in the top 100; by contrast, 12 players were unranked in high school. Two teams, Florida Atlantic and San Diego State, had no top-100 players, with FAU's nine-man rotation featuring six unranked players and only one in the top 200.[12]\n\n\n\n\n## Procedures[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament § Tournament format\n\nA total of 68 teams participated in the tournament with 32 automatic bids being filled by each program that won its conference tournament. The remaining 36 bids were issued \"at-large\", with selections extended by the NCAA Selection Committee on Selection Sunday, March 12.[13] The Selection Committee also seeded the entire field from 1 to 68.\n\n\nEight teams (the four-lowest seeded automatic qualifiers and the four lowest-seeded at-large teams) played in the First Four. The winners of those games advanced to the main tournament bracket.\n\n\n\n## Schedule and venues[edit]\n\n\nThe following are the sites selected to host the each round of the 2023 tournament:[14]\n\n\n\n![2023 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament is located in the United States](image)![Dayton](image)\nDayton\n![Orlando](image)\nOrlando\n![Birmingham](image)\nBirmingham\n![Des Moines](image)\nDes Moines\n![Sacramento](image)\nSacramento\n![Albany](image)\nAlbany\n![Greensboro](image)\nGreensboro\n![Columbus](image)\nColumbus\n![Denver](image)\nDenver\nclass=notpageimage|\n2023 First Four (orange) and first and second rounds (green)\n\n![2023 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament is located in the United States](image)![New York](image)\nNew York\n![Las Vegas](image)\nLas Vegas\n![Louisville](image)\nLouisville\n![Kansas City](image)\nKansas City\n![Houston](image)\nHouston\nclass=notpageimage|\n2023 Regionals (blue) and **Final Four** (red)\n\n**First Four**\n\n\n\n* March 14 and 15\n\t+ University of Dayton Arena, Dayton, Ohio (Host: University of Dayton)\n\n\n**First and second rounds** (subregionals)\n\n\n\n* March 16 and 18\n\t+ Amway Center, Orlando, Florida (Host: University of Central Florida)\n\t+ Legacy Arena, Birmingham, Alabama (Host: Southeastern Conference)\n\t+ Wells Fargo Arena, Des Moines, Iowa (Host: Drake University)\n\t+ Golden 1 Center, Sacramento, California (Host: California State University, Sacramento)\n* March 17 and 19\n\t+ MVP Arena, Albany, New York (Hosts: Siena College, Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference)\n\t+ Greensboro Coliseum, Greensboro, North Carolina (Host: Atlantic Coast Conference)\n\t+ Nationwide Arena, Columbus, Ohio (Host: Ohio State University)\n\t+ Ball Arena, Denver, Colorado (Host: Mountain West Conference)\n\n\n**Regional semi-finals and finals (Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight)**\n\n\n\n* March 23 and 25\n\t+ **East regional**\n\t\t- Madison Square Garden, New York, New York (Hosts: Big East Conference, St. John's University)\n\t+ **West regional**\n\t\t- T-Mobile Arena, Las Vegas, Nevada (Host: University of Nevada, Las Vegas)\n* March 24 and 26\n\t+ **South regional**\n\t\t- KFC Yum!
