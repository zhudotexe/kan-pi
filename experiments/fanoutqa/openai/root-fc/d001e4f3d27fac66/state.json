It is organized around shared values of pluralism, liberal democracy, and representative government.[1][2][3] G7 members are the major IMF advanced economies.\n\n\nOriginating from an *ad hoc* gathering of finance ministers in 1973, the G7 has since become a formal, high-profile venue for discussing and coordinating solutions to major global issues, especially in the areas of trade, security, economics, and climate change.[4] Each member's head of government or state, along with the EU's Commission President and European Council President, meet annually at the G7 Summit; other high-ranking officials of the G7 and the EU meet throughout the year. Representatives of other states and international organizations are often invited as guests, with Russia having been a formal member (as part of the G8) from 1997 until its expulsion in 2014.\n\n\nThe G7 is not based on a treaty and has no permanent secretariat or office. It is organized through a presidency that rotates annually among the member states, with the presiding state setting the group's priorities and hosting the summit; Japan presides for 2023.[5] While lacking a legal or institutional basis, the G7 is widely considered to wield significant international influence;[6] it has catalyzed or spearheaded several major global initiatives, including efforts to combat the HIV/AIDS pandemic, provide financial aid to developing countries, and address climate change through the 2015 Paris Agreement.[6][1][7] However, the group has been criticized by observers for its allegedly outdated and limited membership, narrow global representation, and ineffectualness.[8][9][10]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Origins[edit]\n\n\nThe concept of a forum for the capitalist world's major industrialized countries emerged before the 1973 oil crisis. On 25 March 1973, the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, George Shultz, convened an informal gathering of finance ministers from West Germany (Helmut Schmidt), France (Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing), and the United Kingdom (Anthony Barber) before an upcoming meeting in Washington, D.C. U.S. President Richard Nixon offered the White House as a venue, and the meeting was subsequently held in its library on the ground floor;[11] the original group of four consequently became known as the \"Library Group\".[12] In mid-1973, at the Spring Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, Shultz proposed the addition of Japan, which all members accepted.[11] The informal gathering of senior financial officials from the U.S., U.K., West Germany, Japan, and France became known as the \"Group of Five\".[13]\n\n\nIn 1974, all five members endured sudden and often troubled changes in leadership. French President Georges Pompidou abruptly died, leading to a fresh presidential election that was closely won by Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing. West German Chancellor Willy Brandt, American President Richard Nixon, and Japanese Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka all resigned due to scandals. In the United Kingdom, a hung election led to a minority government whose subsequent instability prompted another election the same year. Consequently, Nixon's successor, Gerald Ford, proposed a retreat the following year for the group's new leaders to learn about one another.\n\n\n\n### First summit and expansion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)First G6 summit at the Chateau de Rambouillet in November 1975\nAt the initiative of Giscard d'Estaing and his German counterpart, Helmut Schmidt, France hosted a three-day summit in November 1975, inviting the Group of Five plus Italy, forming the \"Group of Six\" (G6).[14] Taking place at the Ch\u00e2teau de Rambouillet, the meeting focused on several major economic issues, including the oil crisis, the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, and the ongoing global recession.[15] The result was the 15-point \"Declaration of Rambouillet\", which, among other positions, announced the group's united commitment to promoting free trade, multilateralism, cooperation with the developing world, and rapprochement with the Eastern Bloc.[16] The members also established plans for future gatherings to take place regularly every year.\n\n\nIn 1976, British Prime Minister Harold Wilson, who had participated in the first G6 summit, resigned from office; Schmidt and Ford believed the group needed an English speaker with more political experience, and advocated for inviting Pierre Trudeau, who had been Prime Minister of Canada for eight years\u00a0\u2013 significantly longer than any G6 leader. Canada was also the next largest advanced economy after the G6 members.[17] The summit in Dorado, Puerto Rico later that year became the first of the current Group of Seven (G7).[15]\n\n\nIn 1977, the United Kingdom, which hosted that year's summit, invited the European Economic Community to join all G7 summits; beginning in 1981, it has attended every gathering through the president of the European Commission and the leader of the country holding the presidency of the Council of the European Union.[18] Since 2009, the then-newly established position of the President of the European Council, who serves as the Union's principal foreign representative, also regularly attends the summits.\n\n\n\n### Rising profile[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Flags of G7 members as seen on University Avenue, Toronto (September 2016)\nUntil the 1985 Plaza Accord, meetings between the seven governments' finance ministers were not public knowledge. The Accord, which involved only the original Group of Five, was announced the day before it was finalized, with a communiqu\u00e9 issued afterward.[19] The 1980s also marked the G7's expanded concerns beyond macroeconomic issues, namely with respect to international security and conflict; for example, it sought to address the ongoing conflicts between Iran and Iraq and between the Soviet Union and Afghanistan.\n\n\nFollowing the 1994 summit in Naples, Russian officials held separate meetings with leaders of the G7. This informal arrangement was dubbed the \"Political 8\" (P8), colloquially the G7+1. At the invitation of the G7 leaders, Russian President Boris Yeltsin was invited first as a guest observer, and later as a full participant. After the 1997 meeting, Russia was formally invited to the next meeting and formally joined the group in 1998, resulting in the Group of Eight (G8).[15] Russia was an outlier in the group, as it lacked the national wealth and financial weight of other members, had never been a major advanced economy, and was not yet an established liberal democracy.[20][21] Its invitation, made during a difficult transition to a post-communist economy, is believed to have been motivated by a desire to encourage its political and economic reforms and international engagement.\n\n\nRussia's membership was suspended in March 2014 in response to its annexation of Crimea.[22][23][24] Members stopped short of permanently ejecting the country,[25] and in subsequent years expressed an openness or express desire to reinstate Russian participation. In January 2017, Russia announced it would permanently leave the G8, which came into effect June 2018.[26][27] In 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump, backed by Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, advocated for Russia's return; all other members rejected the proposal, and Russia expressed no interest.[28]\n\n\n\n## Renewed calls for expanded membership[edit]\n\n\nThere have been various proposals to expand the G7. The U.S.-based Atlantic Council has held the D-10 Strategy Forum since 2014 with representatives from what it calls \"leading democracies\" which support a \"rules-based democratic order\", consisting of all members of the G7 (including the European Union) plus Australia and South Korea. Several democratic countries\u00a0\u2013 including India, Indonesia, Poland, and Spain\u00a0\u2013 participate as observers.[29] Centered around a similar mandate as the G7, the D-10 has been considered by some analysts to be an alternative to the group;[30] This is also favored by various think tanks and former British leader Boris Johnson.[29]\n\n\nIn 2019 under Putin, Russia had signaled support for the inclusion of China, India, and Turkey if the G7 had reinstated Russian membership.[31]\n\n\nIn 2020 under Trump, the U.S. had signaled support for the inclusion of Australia, Brazil, India, and South Korea, plus the reincorporation of Russia.[32][33] The leaders of the other six G7 members unanimously rejected this proposal.[34]\n\n\nAlso in November 2020, Jared Cohen and Richard Fontaine, writing in Foreign Affairs, suggested that the G7 might be expanded to a \"T-12\" of \"Techno Democracies\". Earlier, in June of that same year, the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI) was announced. Something of a spin-out of the G7, founded by members Canada and France, GPAI's initial membership was 15, including both the EU and India, as well as Australia, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore, Slovenia, and the Republic of Korea.\n\n\nBoris Johnson invited members of Australia and the Republic of Korea to the June 2021 G7 summit.[30] India was also invited to the 2021 summit, with an aim to \"deepen the expertise and experience around the table\" along with the other guests, according to a U.K. government statement.[35]\n\n\nIn 2021, French jurist and consultant Eric Garner de B\u00e9ville, a member of the *Cercle Montesquieu*, proposed Spain's membership to the G7.[36] American Charg\u00e9 d'Affaires in Spain, Conrad Tribble, stated that the United States \"enthusiastically supports\" a \"greater\" role of Spanish leadership at the international level.[37]\n\n\nIn 2022, Germany has confirmed it will be inviting India,[38] against rumours to the contrary.[39][40][*needs update*]\n\n\nIn 2023, Japan's prime minister Fumio Kishida invited South Korea, Australia, India, Indonesia, Brazil, Vietnam, Comoros (representing the African Union), the Cook Islands (representing the Pacific Islands Forum) and Ukraine to the 49th summit hosted in Hiroshima.[41][42][43][44][45][46]\n\n\n\n## Activities and initiatives[edit]\n\n\n![G7 is located in Europe](image)![1st](image)\n1st\n![3rd, 10th, 17th](image)\n3rd, 10th, 17th\n![4th, 11th](image)\n4th, 11th\n![6th, 13th](image)\n6th, 13th\n![8th](image)\n8th\n![15th](image)\n15th\n![18th](image)\n18th\n![20th](image)\n20th\n![22nd](image)\n22nd\n![24th](image)\n24th\n![25th](image)\n25th\n![27th](image)\n27th\n![29th](image)\n29th\n![31st](image)\n31st\n![32nd](image)\n32nd\n![33rd](image)\n33rd\n![35th](image)\n35th\n![37th](image)\n37th\n![39th](image)\n39th\n![40th](image)\n40th\n![41st](image)\n41st\n![43rd'](image)\n43rd'\n![45th](image)\n45th\n![47th](image)\n47th\nclass=notpageimage|\nHost venues of G7 summits in Europe\n\nThe G7 was founded primarily to facilitate shared macroeconomic initiatives in response to contemporary economic problems; the first gathering was centered around the Nixon shock, the 1970s energy crisis, and the ensuing global recession.[47] Since 1975, the group has met annually at summits organized and hosted by whichever country occupies the annually-rotating presidency;[48] since 1987, the G7 Finance Ministers have met at least semi-annually, and up to four times a year at stand-alone meetings.[49]\n\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, the G7 broadened its areas of concern to include issues of international security, human rights, and global security; for example, during this period, the G7 concerned itself with the ongoing Iran-Iraq War and Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.[48] In the 1990s, it launched a debt-relief program for the 42 heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC);[50] provided $300 million to help build the Shelter Structure over the damaged reactor at Chernobyl;[51] and established the Financial Stability Forum to help in \"managing the international monetary system\".[52]\n\n\n\n![G7 is located in North America](image)![2nd](image)\n2nd\n![7th](image)\n7th\n![9th](image)\n9th\n![14th](image)\n14th\n![16th](image)\n16th\n![21st](image)\n21st\n![23rd](image)\n23rd\n![28th](image)\n28th\n![30th](image)\n30th\n![36th](image)\n36th\n![38th](image)\n38th\n![44th](image)\n44th\nclass=notpageimage|\nHost venues of G7 summits in North America\n\nAt the turn of the 21st century, the G7 began emphasizing engagement with the developing world. At the 1999 summit, the group helped launch the G20, a similar forum made up of the G7 and the next 13 largest economies (including the European Union), in order to \"promote dialogue between major industrial and emerging market countries\";[52] the G20 has been touted by some of its members as a replacement for the G7.[53] Having previously announced a plan to cancel 90% of bilateral debt for the HIPC, totaling $100 billion, in 2005 the G7 announced debt reductions of \"up to 100%\" to be negotiated on a \"case by case\" basis.[54]\n\n\nFollowing the global financial crisis of 2007\u20132008, which was the worst of its kind since the 1970s,[55] the G7 met twice in Washington, D.C. in 2008 and in Rome, the following February.[56][57] News media reported that much of the world was looking to the group for leadership and solutions.[58] G7 finance ministers pledged to take \"all necessary steps\" to stem the crisis,[59] devising an \"aggressive action plan\" that included providing publicly funded capital infusions to banks in danger of failing.[60] Some analysts criticized the group for seemingly advocating that individual governments develop individual responses to the recession, rather than cohere around a united effort.[61]\n\n\nIn subsequent years, the G7 has faced several geopolitical challenges that have led some international analysts to question its credibility,[62] or propose its replacement by the G20.[63] On 2 March 2014, the G7 condemned the Russian Federation for its \"violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine\" through its military intervention.[64] The group also announced its commitment to \"mobilize rapid technical assistance to support Ukraine in addressing its macroeconomic, regulatory and anti-corruption challenges\", while adding that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was best suited to stabilizing the country's finances and economy.[64]\n\n\n\n![G7 is located in Japan](image)![5th, 12th, 19th](image)\n5th, 12th, 19th\n![26th](image)\n26th\n![34th](image)\n34th\n![42nd](image)\n42nd\n![49th](image)\n49th\nclass=notpageimage|\nHost venues of G7 summits in Japan\n\nIn response to Russia's subsequent annexation of Crimea, on 24 March the G7 convened an emergency meeting at the official residence of the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, the Catshuis in The Hague; this location was chosen because all G7 leaders were already present to attend the 2014 Nuclear Security Summit hosted by the Netherlands. This was the first G7 meeting neither taking place in a member state nor having the host leader participating in the meeting.[65] The upcoming G8 summit in Sochi, Russia was moved to Brussels, where the EU was the host. On 5 June 2014 the G7 condemned Moscow for its \"continuing violation\" of Ukraine's sovereignty and stated they were prepared to impose further sanctions on Russia.[66] This meeting was the first since Russia was suspended from the G8,[66] and subsequently it has not been involved in any G7 summit.\n\n\nThe G7 has continued to take a strong stance against Russia's \"destabilising behaviour and malign activities\" in Ukraine and elsewhere around the world, following the joint communique from the June 2021 summit in the U.K.[67] The group also called on Russia to address international cybercrime attacks launched from within its borders, and to investigate the use of chemical weapons on Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny.[67] The June 2021 summit also saw the G7 commit to helping the world recover from the global COVID-19 pandemic (including plans to help vaccinate the entire world); encourage further action against climate change and biodiversity loss; and promote \"shared values\" of pluralism and democracy.[35]\n\n\nIn 2022, G7 leaders were invited to attend an extraordinary summit of NATO called in response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[68][69]\n\n\n\n### Summit organization[edit]\n\n\nThe annual G7 summit is attended by each member's head of government.[70] The member country holding the G7 presidency is responsible for organizing and hosting the year's summit. The serial annual summits can be parsed chronologically in arguably distinct ways, including as the sequence of host countries for the summits has recurred over time and series.[71] Generally every country hosts the summit once every seven years.[72]\n\n\nBesides a main meeting in June or July, a number of other meetings may take place throughout the year; in 2021 for example, seven tracks existed for finance (4\u20135 June 2021), environmental (20 and 21 May 2021), health (3\u20134 June 2021), trade (27\u201328 May 2021), interior (7\u20139 September 2021) digital and technology (28\u201329 April 2021), development (3\u20135 May 2021) and foreign ministers.[73]\n\n\n\n\n## List of summits[edit]\n\n\n\n\nOverview of G7 summits\n| #\n | Date\n | Host\n | Host leader\n | Location held\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1st | 15\u201317 November 1975 | ![](image)\u00a0France | Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing | Ch\u00e2teau de Rambouillet, Yvelines | The first and last G6 summit.\n |\n| 2nd | 27\u201328 June 1976 | ![](image)\u00a0United States | Gerald R.

The People's Republic of China, according to its data, would be the second-largest with 17.90% of the world net wealth,[130] but is excluded because of its relatively low net wealth per adult and Human Development Index.[20] As of 2021, Cr\u00e9dit Suisse reports the G7 (without the European Union) represents around 53% of the global net wealth;[131] including the EU, the G7 accounts for over 60% of the global net wealth.[131]\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview of G7 members\n| Member\n | Trade mil.

About 300 of those reached the 3\u00a0m high and 7\u00a0km long security fence surrounding the summit location. The protesters questioned the legitimacy of the G7 to make decisions that could affect the whole world. Authorities had banned demonstrations in the area closest to the summit location and 20,000 police were on duty in Southern Bavaria to keep activists and protesters from interfering with the summit.[134][135]\n\n\n\n### 2018 Trump conflict over tariffs and Russia[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: 44th G7 summit and Russo-Ukrainian War\n\nThe 2018 meeting in Charlevoix, Canada, was marred by fractious negotiations concerning tariffs and Donald Trump's position that Russia should be reinstated to the G7. The Trump administration had just imposed steel and aluminium tariffs on many countries, including European countries that are fellow members of the G7, and Canada, the host country for the 2018 meeting. Trump expressed dismay at Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for holding a press conference in which Canada restated its position on tariffs (a public criticism of Trump's economic policy), and directed his representatives at the meeting not to sign the economic section of the joint communiqu\u00e9 that is typically issued at the conclusion of the meeting.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel described Trump's behaviour as a \"depressing withdrawal\", while French President Emmanuel Macron invited him \"to be serious\".[136] In the final statement signed by all members except the US, the G7 announced its intention to recall sanctions and to be ready to take further restrictive measures within the next months against the Russian Federation for its failure to completely implement the Minsk Agreement.[108]\n\n\nTrump repeated calls for Russia to be re-admitted to the group at the 2019 meeting in Biarritz, saying it should be included in discussions relating to Iran, Syria, and North Korea. The Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte supported Trump's proposal, Shinzo Abe of Japan was neutral, and the rest of the G7 pushed back against the suggestion, after which the atmosphere allegedly became \"tense\". [*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### 2019 Amazon rainforest fires and Brazil[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: 45th G7 summit and 2019 Brazil wildfires\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump's reiteration that Russia should be readmitted to the group (see above), the instigation of a trade war with China, increased tensions in Iran, Trump's alleged reluctance to attend the conference, and a number of international crises made the 2019 G7 meeting in Biarritz, France, the most divided since its inception. Following President Trump's previous revocation of his signature to a joint communiqu\u00e9 agreed to in 2018 due to an alleged slight from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (see above), French President Emmanuel Macron agreed that the group would not issue a joint communiqu\u00e9 at the Biarritz conference.\n\n\nThe G7 nations pledged US$20 million to help Brazil and other countries in South America fight the wildfires. This money was welcomed, although it was widely seen as a \"relatively small amount\" given the scale of the problem. Macron threatened to block a major trade deal between the European Union and Brazil (Mercosur) that would benefit the agricultural interests accused of driving deforestation.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Build Back Better World\n* Capitalism\n* D-10 Strategy Forum\n* Developed country\n* E7 (countries)\n* G4 (EU)\n* G6 (EU)\n* G8\n* G8+5\n* G10 currencies\n* G20\n* Great power\n* Group of Twelve (G12)\n* Junior 8\n* List of country groupings\n* List of G7 leaders\n* List of multilateral free trade agreements\n* OECD\n* Quint\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"What is the G7?\". *G7 UK Presidency 2021*.

Important documents, such as legislation, are translated into every official language and the European Parliament provides translation for documents and plenary sessions.[246][247] Most EU institutions use only a handful of working languages: the European Commission conducts its internal business in three *procedural languages*: English, French, and German;[248] the Court of Justice uses French as the working language,[249] and the European Central Bank conducts its business primarily in English.[250][251] Even though language policy is the responsibility of member states, EU institutions promote multilingualism among its citizens.[f][252]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of the European Union\n\nSee also: Translation Centre for the Bodies of the European Union\n\n\n\nOfficial languages by percentage of speakers, 2012[s][*failed verification*]\n| Language\n | Native speakers[t] | Total[u] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| German | 18%\n | 32%\n |\n| French | 13%\n | 26%\n |\n| Italian | 12%\n | 16%\n |\n| Spanish\n | 8%\n | 15%\n |\n| Polish | 8%\n | 9%\n |\n| Romanian | 5%\n | 5%\n |\n| Dutch | 4%\n | 5%\n |\n| Greek | 3%\n | 4%\n |\n| Hungarian | 3%\n | 3%\n |\n| Portuguese | 2%\n | 3%\n |\n| Czech | 2%\n | 3%\n |\n| Swedish | 2%\n | 3%\n |\n| Bulgarian | 2%\n | 2%\n |\n| English\n | 1%\n | 51%\n |\n| Slovak | 1%\n | 2%\n |\n| Danish | 1%\n | 1%\n |\n| Finnish | 1%\n | 1%\n |\n| Lithuanian | 1%\n | 1%\n |\n| Croatian | 1%\n | 1%\n |\n| Slovene | <1%\n | <1%\n |\n| Estonian | <1%\n | <1%\n |\n| Irish | <1%\n | <1%\n |\n| Latvian | <1%\n | <1%\n |\n| Maltese | <1%\n | <1%\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLuxembourgish (in Luxembourg) and Turkish (in Cyprus) are the only two national languages that are not official languages of the EU. Catalan, Galician and Basque are not recognised official languages of the EU but have official status in Spain. Therefore, official translations of the treaties are made into them and citizens have the right to correspond with the institutions in these languages.[256][257] There are about 150 regional and minority languages in the EU, spoken by up to 50\u00a0million people.[258] The European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages ratified by most EU states provides general guidelines that states can follow to protect their linguistic heritage. The European Day of Languages is held annually on 26 September and is aimed at encouraging language learning across Europe.[259]\n\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in the European Union\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Organisations | * Arab League\n* ASEAN\n* Council of Europe\n* ECHR\n* G7\n* ICC\n* IOC\n* Mercosur\n* NATO\n* UN\n |\n| Initiatives | * African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States\n* Asia\u2013Europe Meeting\n* CARIFORUM\n* Customs Union\n* Eastern Partnership\n* Energy Community\n* Euro-Latin American Parliamentary Assembly\n* European Common Aviation Area\n* European Economic Area\n* Euro-Mediterranean free trade area\n* Euro-Mediterranean Partnership\n* Euronest\n* Economic Partnership Agreements\n* EU CBRN Risk Mitigation CoE Initiative\n* Neighbourhood Policy\n* Northern Dimension\n* Mediterranean Union\n* Stabilisation and Association Process\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Administration and policies\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n255. **^** European Commission (2006). \"Special Eurobarometer 243: Europeans and their Languages (Executive Summary)\" (PDF).

Competence in scrutinising and amending legislation is shared between the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament, while executive tasks are performed by the European Commission and in a limited capacity by the European Council (not to be confused with the aforementioned Council of the European Union). The monetary policy of the eurozone is determined by the European Central Bank. The interpretation and the application of EU law and the treaties are ensured by the Court of Justice of the European Union. The EU budget is scrutinised by the European Court of Auditors.

They also signed another pact creating the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) for cooperation in developing nuclear power. Both treaties came into force in 1958.[35] Although the EEC and Euratom were created separately from the ECSC, they shared the same courts and the Common Assembly. The EEC was headed by Walter Hallstein (Hallstein Commission) and Euratom was headed by Louis Armand (Armand Commission) and then \u00c9tienne Hirsch (Hirsch Commission).[36][37] The OEEC was in turn reformed in 1961 into the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and its membership was extended to states outside of Europe, the United States and Canada. During the 1960s, tensions began to show, with France seeking to limit supranational power. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * History\n* Financial (and social) rankings\n* Free trade areas\n* Energy\n* Telecommunications\n* Transport\n |\n| Intergovernmental | * Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA)\n* Eurasian Customs Union (EACU)\n* Eurasian Economic Community (EAEC)\n* European Free Trade Association (EFTA)\n |\n| Sovereign states by | * Average wage\n* Budget revenues\n\t+ per capita\n* GDP (nominal)\n\t+ per capita\n* GDP (PPP)\n\t+ per capita\n* GNI (nominal) per capita\n* GNI (PPP) per capita\n* HDI\n* Internet users (%)\n* Minimum wage\n* Press Freedom Index\n* Unemployment rate (%)\n* Health expense per capita\n* Military spending (%)\n* Urban population (%)\n* Electricity use per capita\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| Society | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n**Competences of the European Union in relation to those of its member states**[77]* view\n* talk\n* edit\n\n| \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Exclusive competence\n |\n\n | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Shared competence\n |\n\n | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Supporting competence\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| *The Union has exclusive competence to make directives and conclude international agreements when provided for in a Union legislative act as to \u2026* |\n| * the customs union\n* the establishing of the competition rules necessary for the functioning of the internal market\n* monetary policy for the Member States whose currency is the euro\n* the conservation of marine biological resources under the common fisheries policy\n* Common Commercial Policy\n* conclusion of certain international agreements\n |\n\n | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAlso, three European microstates\u2014Monaco, San Marino, and the Vatican City\u2014maintain open borders for passenger traffic with their neighbours, and are therefore considered *de facto* members of the Schengen Area due to the practical impossibility of travelling to or from them without transiting through at least one Schengen member country.\n\n\n\n### Candidate countries[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Potential enlargement of the European Union\n\nThere are eight countries that are recognised as candidates for membership: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia, Turkey and Ukraine.[143][144][145] Norway, Switzerland and Iceland have submitted membership applications in the past, but subsequently frozen or withdrawn them.[146] Additionally, Georgia and Kosovo are officially recognised as potential candidates,[143][147] and have submitted membership applications.[148]\n\n\n\n### Former members[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTo become a member, a country must meet the Copenhagen criteria, defined at the 1993 meeting of the European Council in Copenhagen. These require a stable democracy that respects human rights and the rule of law; a functioning market economy; and the acceptance of the obligations of membership, including EU law. Evaluation of a country's fulfilment of the criteria is the responsibility of the European Council.[138]\n\n\nThe four countries forming the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) are not EU members, but have partly committed to the EU's economy and regulations: Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, which are a part of the single market through the European Economic Area, and Switzerland, which has similar ties through bilateral treaties.[139][140] The relationships of the European microstates, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, and Vatican City include the use of the euro and other areas of co-operation.[141]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Map showing the member states of the European Union (clickable)\nThrough successive enlargements, the European Union has grown from the six founding states (Belgium, France, West Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands) to 27 members. Countries accede to the union by becoming a party to the founding treaties, thereby subjecting themselves to the privileges and obligations of EU membership.

Being an element within the wider area of freedom, security and justice policy of the EU, it mostly functions as a single jurisdiction under a common visa policy for international travel purposes. The area is named after the 1985 Schengen Agreement and the 1990 Schengen Convention, both signed in Schengen, Luxembourg. Of the 27 EU member states, 23 participate in the Schengen Area. Of the four EU members that are not part of the Schengen Area, three\u2014Bulgaria, Cyprus, and Romania\u2014are legally obligated to join the area in the future; Ireland maintains an opt-out, and instead operates its own visa policy. The four European Free Trade Association (EFTA) member states, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland, are not members of the EU, but have signed agreements in association with the Schengen Agreement. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **External Action Service** | * Command structure on the civilian/military strategic and operational levels (Military Planning and Conduct Capability within the Military Staff, Civilian Planning and Conduct Capability, Joint Support Coordination Cell)\n* Intelligence and Situation Centre (Club de Berne)\n* Crisis Management and Planning Directorate\n* Security & Defence College\n |\n| **Agencies** | * Defence Agency\n* Institute for Security Studies\n* Satellite Centre\n |\n| **Council preparatory bodies** | * Committee of Permanent Representatives\n* Political and Security Committee\n* Politico-Military Group\n* Military Committee\n* Committee for Civilian Aspects of Crisis Management\n |\n| **European Commission bodies** | * Directorate-General for Defence Industry and Space\n |\n| **Funding** | * Defence Fund\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Budget\n* Currencies\n* Community preference\n* Government procurement\n* Eurozone\n\t+ Euro\n\t\t- International status and usage\n* Transport\n\t+ TRACECA\n* Minimum wage\n* Average wage\n* Unemployment rate\n* Health expense per person\n |\n\n |\n| Politics | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Eastern Partnership Summit 2017, Brussels\nThe European Union uses foreign relations instruments like the European Neighbourhood Policy which seeks to tie those countries to the east and south of the European territory of the EU to the union. These countries, primarily developing countries, include some who seek to one day become either a member state of the European Union, or more closely integrated with the European Union. The EU offers financial assistance to countries within the European Neighbourhood, so long as they meet the strict conditions of government reform, economic reform and other issues surrounding positive transformation. This process is normally underpinned by an Action Plan, as agreed by both Brussels and the target country.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n47. **^** Journal, This article was prepared by reporters Michael M.

(It does not have a formal constitution: its status is defined by the Treaty of European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union). It is more integrated than a traditional confederation of states because the general level of government widely employs qualified majority voting in some decision-making among the member states, rather than relying exclusively on unanimity.[99][100] It is less integrated than a federal state because it is not a state in its own right: sovereignty continues to flow 'from the bottom up', from the several peoples of the separate member states, rather than from a single undifferentiated whole. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n31. **^** Hansen, Peo; Jonsson, Stefan (2011). \"Bringing Africa as a 'Dowry to Europe'\". *Interventions*. **13** (3): 443\u2013463 (459). doi:10.1080/1369801X.2011.597600.

In the eurozone, trade is helped by not having any currency differences to deal with amongst most members.[183]\n\n\n\n\n### Competition and consumer protection[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: European Union competition law and European consumer law\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n101. **^** William Phelan, *Great Judgments of the European Court of Justice: Rethinking the Landmark Decisions of the Foundational Period* (Cambridge, 2019).\n102. **^** \"Sources of EU law\".

This was the first common political framework for space activities established by the EU. Each member state has pursued to some extent their own national space policy, though often co-ordinating through the ESA. G\u00fcnter Verheugen, the European Commissioner for Enterprise and Industry, has stated that even though the EU is \"a world leader in the technology, it is being put on the defensive by the United States and Russia and that it only has about a 10-year technological advantage on China and India, which are racing to catch up.\"\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe EU is independent from the Council of Europe, although they share purpose and ideas, especially on the rule of law, human rights and democracy. Furthermore, the European Convention on Human Rights and European Social Charter, as well as the source of law for the Charter of Fundamental Rights are created by the Council of Europe. The EU has also promoted human rights issues in the wider world. The EU opposes the death penalty and has proposed its worldwide abolition. Abolition of the death penalty is a condition for EU membership.[229] On 19 October 2020, the European Union revealed new plans to create a legal structure to act against human rights violations worldwide. The new plan was expected to provide the European Union with greater flexibility to target and sanction those responsible for serious human rights violations and abuses around the world.[230]\n\n\n\nExamples of identity, travel and health documents used in the EU\n* ![An EEA national identity card (German version pictured)](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Berend, Ivan T.

In other policy areas, the EU can only co-ordinate, support and supplement member state action but cannot enact legislation with the aim of harmonising national laws.[76] That a particular policy area falls into a certain category of competence is not necessarily indicative of what legislative procedure is used for enacting legislation within that policy area.

In 1979, the first direct elections to the European Parliament were held.[42] Greece joined in 1981. In 1985, Greenland left the Communities, following a dispute over fishing rights.

To prevent the joining states from getting into financial trouble or crisis after entering the monetary union, they were obliged in the Maastricht treaty to fulfil important financial obligations and procedures, especially to show budgetary discipline and a high degree of sustainable economic convergence, as well as to avoid excessive government deficits and limit the government debt to a sustainable level, as agreed in the European Fiscal Pact.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n81. **^** \"Legislative powers\". *European Parliament*.

The president and vice-presidents are elected by MEPs every two and a half years.[94]\n\n\n\n#### Judicial branch[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Court of Justice of the European Union\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe stated aims of the CFSP are to promote both the EU's own interests and those of the international community as a whole, including the furtherance of international co-operation, respect for human rights, democracy, and the rule of law.[107] The CFSP requires unanimity among the member states on the appropriate policy to follow on any particular issue. The unanimity and difficult issues treated under the CFSP sometimes lead to disagreements, such as those which occurred over the war in Iraq.[108]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nChristians in the EU include Catholics of both Roman and Eastern Rite, numerous Protestant denominations with Lutherans, Anglicans, and Reformed forming the majority of Protestant affiliations, and the Eastern Orthodox Church. In 2009, the EU had an estimated Muslim population of 13\u00a0million,[263] and an estimated Jewish population of over a million.[264] The other world religions of Buddhism, Hinduism, and Sikhism are also represented in the EU population.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex) is an agency of the EU aiming to detect and stop illegal immigration, human trafficking and terrorist infiltration.[135] The EU also operates the European Travel Information and Authorisation System, the Entry/Exit System, the Schengen Information System, the Visa Information System and the Common European Asylum System which provide common databases for police and immigration authorities. The impetus for the development of this co-operation was the advent of open borders in the Schengen Area and the associated cross-border crime.[17]\n\n\n\n\n## Member states[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Member state of the European Union\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRail transportation is organized under the TEN-T by the Trans-European Rail network, made up of the high-speed rail network and the conventional rail network. The Gare du Nord railway station is the busiest in the EU, located in and near the city of Paris, in France.[207][208] Rail transport in Europe is being synchronised with the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) with the goal of greatly enhancing safety, increase efficiency of train transports and enhance cross-border interoperability. This is done by replacing former national signalling equipment and operational procedures with a single new Europe-wide standard for train control and command systems. This system is conducted by the European Union Agency for Railways (ERA).\n\n\n\nTransport documents used in the European Union\n* ![European driving licence (Croatian version pictured)](image)\n\nEuropean driving licence (Croatian version pictured)\n* ![European vehicle registration plate (Slovak version pictured)](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe EU has also established agencies to co-ordinate police, prosecution and civil litigations across the member states: Europol for police co-operation, CEPOL for training of police forces[224] and the Eurojust for co-operation between prosecutors and courts.[225] It also operates the EUCARIS database of vehicles and drivers, the Eurodac, the European Criminal Records Information System, the European Cybercrime Centre, FADO, PRADO and others.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe judicial branch of the European Union is formally called the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) and consists of two courts: the Court of Justice and the General Court.[95] The Court of Justice is the supreme court of the European Union in matters of European Union law. As a part of the CJEU, it is tasked with interpreting EU law and ensuring its uniform application across all EU member states under Article 263 of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The Court was established in 1952, and is based in Luxembourg. It is composed of one judge per member state \u2013 currently 27 \u2013 although it normally hears cases in panels of three, five or fifteen judges. The Court has been led by president Koen Lenaerts since 2015. The CJEU is the highest court of the European Union in matters of Union law. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter the economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the EU leaders agreed for the first time to emit common debt to finance the European Recovery Program called Next Generation EU **(NGEU)**.[59]\n\n\nOn 24 February 2022, after massing on the borders of Ukraine, the Russian Armed Forces undertook an attempt for a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.[60][61] The European Union imposed heavy sanctions on Russia and agreed on a pooled military aid package to Ukraine for lethal weapons funded via the European Peace Facility off-budget instrument.[62]\n\n\nPreparing the Union for a new great enlargement is a political priority for the Union, with the goal of achieving over 35 member states by 2030. Institutional and budgetary reforms are being discussed in order to the Union to be ready for the new members.[63][64][65][66]\n\n\n\n### Timeline[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nArticle 50 of the Lisbon Treaty provides the basis for a member to leave the EU. Two territories have left the union: Greenland (an autonomous province of Denmark) withdrew in 1985;[149] the United Kingdom formally invoked Article 50 of the Consolidated Treaty on European Union in 2017, and became the only sovereign state to leave when it withdrew from the EU in 2020.\n\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of the European Union\n\n![](image)Topographic map of Europe (EU highlighted)\nThe EU's member states cover an area of 4,233,262 square kilometres (1,634,472\u00a0sq\u00a0mi),[l] and therefore a large part of the European continent. The EU's highest peak is Mont Blanc in the Graian Alps, 4,810.45 metres (15,782\u00a0ft) above sea level.[150] The lowest points in the EU are Lammefjorden, Denmark, and Zuidplaspolder, Netherlands, at 7\u00a0m (23\u00a0ft) below sea level.[151] The landscape, climate, and economy of the EU are influenced by its coastline, which is 65,993 kilometres (41,006\u00a0mi) long.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNevertheless, in 1965 an agreement was reached, and on 1 July 1967 the Merger Treaty created a single set of institutions for the three communities, which were collectively referred to as the *European Communities*.[38][39] Jean Rey presided over the first merged commission (Rey Commission).[40]\n\n\n\n\n### First enlargement, and European co-operation (1973\u200d\u2013\u200d1993)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the European Communities (1973\u20131993)\n\n![](image)Gerald Ford and the American delegation at the CSCE (1975)\n  \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 2007, EU countries as a whole imported 82 per cent of their oil, 57 per cent of their natural gas[197] and 97.48 per cent of their uranium[198] demands. The three largest suppliers of natural gas to the European Union are Russia, Norway and Algeria, that amounted for about three quarters of the imports in 2019.[199] There is a strong dependence on Russian energy that the EU has been attempting to reduce.[200] However, in May 2022, it was reported that the European Union is preparing another sanction against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. It is expected to target Russian oil, Russian and Belarusian banks, as well as individuals and companies. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n191. **^** \"The Commission prohibits GE's acquisition of Honeywell\".

In 1954 the Modified Brussels Treaty transformed the Western Union into the Western European Union (WEU). West Germany eventually joined 1955 both WEU and NATO, prompting the Soviet Union to form the Warsaw Pact in 1955 as an institutional framework for its military domination in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. Assessing the progress of European integration the Messina Conference was held in 1955, ordering the Spaak report, which in 1956 recommended the next significant steps of European integration.\n\n\n\n\n### Treaty of Rome (1958\u200d\u2013\u200d1972)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the European Communities (1958\u20131972)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n303. **^** \"2018 EU Media Survey\" (PDF).

The anthem of the EU is an instrumental version of the prelude to the *Ode to Joy*, the 4th movement of Ludwig van Beethoven's ninth symphony. The anthem was adopted by European Community leaders in 1985 and has since been played on official occasions.[293]\nBesides naming the continent, the Greek mythological figure of Europa has frequently been employed as a personification of Europe. Known from the myth in which Zeus seduces her in the guise of a white bull, Europa has also been referred to in relation to the present union. Statues of Europa and the bull decorate several of the EU's institutions and a portrait of her is seen on the 2013 series of euro banknotes. The bull is, for its part, depicted on all residence permit cards.[294]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Euro banknotes from the *Europa* series (since 2013)\nIn 1999, the currency union started to materialise through introducing a common accounting (virtual) currency in eleven of the member states. In 2002, it was turned into a fully-fledged conventible currency, when euro notes and coins were issued, while the phaseout of national currencies in the eurozone (consisting by then of 12 member states) was initiated. The eurozone (constituted by the EU member states which have adopted the euro) has since grown to 20 countries.[173][174]\n\n\nThe 20 EU member states known collectively as the eurozone have fully implemented the currency union by superseding their national currencies with the euro. The currency union represents 345\u00a0million EU citizens.[175] The euro is the second largest reserve currency as well as the second most traded currency in the world after the United States dollar.[176][177][178]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe main legal acts of the European Union come in three forms: regulations, directives, and decisions. Regulations become law in all member states the moment they come into force, without the requirement for any implementing measures,[h] and automatically override conflicting domestic provisions.[f] Directives require member states to achieve a certain result while leaving them discretion as to how to achieve the result. The details of how they are to be implemented are left to member states.[i] When the time limit for implementing directives passes, they may, under certain conditions, have direct effect in national law against member states. Decisions offer an alternative to the two above modes of legislation. They are legal acts which only apply to specified individuals, companies or a particular member state. They are most often used in competition law, or on rulings on State Aid, but are also frequently used for procedural or administrative matters within the institutions. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe EU has no formal connection to any religion. Article 17 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union[260] recognises the \"status under national law of churches and religious associations\" as well as that of \"philosophical and non-confessional organisations\".[261] The preamble to the Treaty on European Union mentions the \"cultural, religious and humanist inheritance of Europe\".[261] Discussion over the draft texts of the European Constitution and later the Treaty of Lisbon included proposals to mention Christianity or a god, or both, in the preamble of the text, but the idea faced opposition and was dropped.[262]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Rosamond, Ben (2000). *Theories of European Integration*.

There are some EU policies that have affected sport, such as the free movement of workers, which was at the core of the Bosman ruling that prohibited national football leagues from imposing quotas on foreign players with EU member state citizenship.[286]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe EU has five key points in its energy policy: increase competition in the internal market, encourage investment and boost interconnections between electricity grids; diversify energy resources with better systems to respond to a crisis; establish a new treaty framework for energy co-operation with Russia while improving relations with energy-rich states in Central Asia[196] and North Africa; use existing energy supplies more efficiently while increasing renewable energy commercialisation; and finally increase funding for new energy technologies.[195]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n113. **^** Bildt, Carl (2005). \"Europe must keep its 'soft power'\". *Financial Times on Centre for European Reform*.

Post-Maastricht there has been a rapidly developing corpus of ECJ judgements regarding this initially neglected freedom. The free movement of capital is unique insofar as it is granted equally to non-member states.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThis is reflected in the fact that the member states remain the 'masters of the Treaties', retaining control over the allocation of competences to the union through constitutional change (thus retaining so-called *Kompetenz-kompetenz*); in that they retain control of the use of armed force; they retain control of taxation; and in that they retain a right of unilateral withdrawal under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union.

In March 1948 the Treaty of Brussels was signed, establishing the Western Union (WU), followed by the International Authority for the Ruhr. Furthermore, the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (OEEC), the predecessor of the OECD, was also founded in 1948 to manage the Marshall Plan, triggering as a Soviet response formation of the Comecon. The ensuing Hague Congress of May 1948 was a pivotal moment in European integration, as it led to the creation of the European Movement International, the College of Europe[32] and most importantly to the foundation of the Council of Europe on 5 May 1949 (which is now Europe day). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### Background: World Wars and aftermath[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Ideas of European unity before 1948\n\nInternationalism and visions of European unity had been around since well before the 19th century, but gained particularly as a reaction to World War I and its aftermath. In this light first advances for the idea of European integration were made. In 1920 John Maynard Keynes proposed an European customs union for the struggling post-war European economies,[24] and in 1923 the oldest organization for European integration, the Paneuropean Union was founded, lead by Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi, who later would found in June 1947 the European Parliamentary Union (EPU). As French prime minister and follower of the Paneuropean Union Aristide Briand (Nobel Peace Prize laureate for the Locarno Treaties) delivered a widely recognized speech at the League of Nations in Geneva on 5 September 1929 for a federal Europe to secure Europe and settle the historic Franco-German\u00a0enmity.[25][26]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n282. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Bozoki, Andras. \"Cultural Policy and Politics in the European Union\" (PDF).

This required the lowering of administrative formalities and recognition of professional qualifications of other states.[212] The EU seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 6.7 per cent in September 2018.[213] The euro area unemployment rate was 8.1 per cent.[213] Among the member states, the lowest unemployment rates were recorded in the Czech Republic (2.3 per cent), Germany and Poland (both 3.4 per cent), and the highest in Spain (14.9 per cent) and Greece (19.0 in July 2018).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe predecessors of the European Union were not devised as a military alliance because NATO was largely seen as appropriate and sufficient for defence purposes.[122] 22 EU members are members of NATO[123] and Sweden is in the process of accession while the remaining member states follow policies of neutrality.[124] The Western European Union, a military alliance with a mutual defence clause, closed in 2011[125] as its role had been transferred to the EU.[126] Following the Kosovo War in 1999, the European Council agreed that \"the Union must have the capacity for autonomous action, backed by credible military forces, the means to decide to use them, and the readiness to do so, in order to respond to international crises without prejudice to actions by NATO\". To that end, a number of efforts were made to increase the EU's military capability, notably the Helsinki Headline Goal process. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUnder the principle of supremacy, national courts are required to enforce the treaties that their member states have ratified, even if doing so requires them to ignore conflicting national law, and (within limits) even constitutional provisions.[e] The direct effect and supremacy doctrines were not explicitly set out in the European Treaties but were developed by the Court of Justice itself over the 1960s, apparently under the influence of its then most influential judge, Frenchman Robert Lecourt.[101] The question whether the secondary law enacted by the EU has a comparable status in relation to national legislation, has been a matter of debate among legal scholars.\n\n\n\n#### Primary law[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Signing ceremony of the Treaty of Rome (1957), establishing the ECC\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  Largest population centres of the European Unionmetropolitan regions, Eurostat 2021[241]\n |\n| --- |\n| Rank | City name\n | State |  Pop. | Rank | City name\n | State |  Pop. |\n| 1 | **Paris** | France | 12,348,605 | 11 | **Amsterdam** | Netherlands | 3,316,712\n |\n| 2 | **Madrid** | Spain | 6,755,828 | 12 | **Marseille** | France | 3,146,578\n |\n| 3 | **Barcelona** | Spain | 5,639,523 | 13 | **Warsaw** | Poland | 3,095,025\n |\n| 4 | **Berlin** | Germany | 5,351,765 | 14 | **Budapest** | Hungary | 3,033,638\n |\n| 5 | **Ruhr** | Germany | 5,102,484 | 15 | **Naples** | Italy | 2,986,745\n |\n| 6 | **Milan** | Italy | 4,339,269 | 16 | **Munich** | Germany | 2,932,668\n |\n| 7 | **Rome** | Italy | 4,231,451 | 17 | **Vienna** | Austria | 2,890,577\n |\n| 8 | **Athens** | Greece | 3,547,391 | 18 | **Lisbon** | Portugal | 2,869,033\n |\n| 9 | **Hamburg** | Germany | 3,353,084 | 19 | **Stuttgart** | Germany | 2,787,858\n |\n| 10 | **Brussels** | Belgium | 3,333,757 | 20 | **Frankfurt** | Germany | 2,735,932\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n20. **^** Moravcsik, Andrew (2009). \"Europe: The quiet superpower\". *French Politics*. **7** (3\u20134): 403\u2013422. doi:10.1057/fp.2009.29.

The high representative heads up the European External Action Service (EEAS), a unique EU department[109] that has been officially implemented and operational since 1 December 2010 on the occasion of the first anniversary of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon.[110] The EEAS serves as a foreign ministry and diplomatic corps for the European Union.[111]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBodies combatting fraud have also been established, including the European Anti-fraud Office and the European Public Prosecutor's Office.

It is one of the world's most important central banks. The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy for the Eurozone and the European Union, administers the foreign exchange reserves of EU member states, engages in foreign exchange operations, and defines the intermediate monetary objectives and key interest rate of the EU. The ECB Executive Board enforces the policies and decisions of the Governing Council, and may direct the national central banks when doing so. The ECB has the exclusive right to authorise the issuance of euro banknotes. Member states can issue euro coins, but the volume must be approved by the ECB beforehand. The bank also operates the TARGET2 payments system. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)A K\u00f6ppen-Geiger climate classification map of Europe (including non-EU member states)\nThe climate of the European Union is of a temperate, continental nature, with a maritime climate prevailing on the western coasts and a mediterranean climate in the south. The climate is strongly conditioned by the Gulf Stream, which warms the western region to levels unattainable at similar latitudes on other continents. Western Europe is oceanic, while eastern Europe is continental and dry. Four seasons occur in western Europe, while southern Europe experiences a wet season and a dry season. Southern Europe is hot and dry during the summer months. The heaviest precipitation occurs downwind of water bodies due to the prevailing westerlies, with higher amounts also seen in the Alps.\n\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate change in Europe\n\nSee also: European Environment Agency\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Energy Community.\nThe total energy supply of the EU was 59 billion GJ in 2019, about 10.2 per cent of the world total. Approximately three fifths of the energy available in the EU came from imports (mostly of fossil fuels). Renewable energy contributed 18.1 per cent of the EU's total energy supply in 2019, and 11.1 per cent of the final energy consumption.[194]\n\n\nThe EU has had legislative power in the area of energy policy for most of its existence; this has its roots in the original European Coal and Steel Community. The introduction of a mandatory and comprehensive European energy policy was approved at the meeting of the European Council in October 2005, and the first draft policy was published in January 2007.[195]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n214. **^** \"EU Parliament approves Minimum Wage Directive\". 14 September 2022.\n215. **^** \"EU-wide effort on gender-based violence taking shape, but gaps remain\". 21 September 2022.\n216. **^** \"A first insight into the EU proposal for a Directive on countering violence against women and domestic violence\". 7 April 2022.\n217. **^** \"Questions and Answers: European Care Strategy\". *European Commission*. 7 September 2022.
