It is also a member of the BRICS, the G20, APEC, and the East Asia Summit. China ranks poorly in measures of democracy, transparency, and human rights, including for press freedom, religious freedom, and ethnic equality. Making up around one-fifth of the world economy, China is the world's largest economy by GDP at purchasing power parity, the second-largest economy by nominal GDP, and the second-wealthiest country. The country is one of the fastest-growing major economies and is the world's largest manufacturer and exporter, as well as the second-largest importer.

This discrepancy was deduced from comparing the CIA *World Factbook* and its previous iterations against the information for United States in *Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica*, particularly its footnote section.[13] In sum, according to older versions of the CIA *World Factbook* (from 1982 to 1996), the U.S. was listed as the world's fourth-largest country (after Russia, Canada, and China) with a total area of 9,372,610\u00a0km2 (3,618,780\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). However, in the 1997 edition, the U.S. added coastal waters to its total area (increasing it to 9,629,091\u00a0km2 (3,717,813\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)). And then again in 2007, U.S. added territorial water to its total area (increasing it to 9,833,517\u00a0km2 (3,796,742\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)). During this time, China's total area remained unchanged. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Internet penetration rates in China in the context of East Asia and Southeast Asia, 1995\u20132012\nChina is the largest telecom market in the world and currently has the largest number of active cellphones of any country in the world, with over 1.69 billion subscribers, as of February\u00a02023[update].[*citation needed*] It also has the world's largest number of internet and broadband users, with over 1.05 billion Internet users since 2021[update][433]\u2014equivalent to around 73.7% of its population\u2014and almost all of them being mobile as well.

They heard about it on the radio, from relations and friends, by reading newspapers and, later, through government pamphlets. Among a population of almost four hundred million, where the vast majority live in the countryside, ploughing the land as landless peasants or sharecroppers, it is hardly surprising that many thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, did not hear the news for many weeks afterwards. For some, the butchery and forced relocation of the summer months of 1947 may have been the first that they knew about the creation of the two new states rising from the fragmentary and terminally weakened British empire in India\n60. **^** (a) Copland 2001, pp.\u00a071\u201378;  \n(b) Metcalf & Metcalf 2006, p.\u00a0222.\n61. **^** Dyson 2018, pp.\u00a0219, 262\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n455. **^** \"Popular India Festivals\", *festivals.indobase.com*, archived from the original on 28 July 2011, retrieved 23 December 2007\n456. **^** Pathania, Rajni (January 2020). \"Literacy in India: Progress and Inequality\" (PDF). *bangladeshsociology.org*. **17** (1).

Many policy issues are decentralized at a state or local level, with widely differing laws by jurisdiction which may not conflict with the Constitution.[26][27] The U.S. ranks very highly in international measures of quality of life, income and wealth, economic competitiveness, human rights, innovation, and education; it has low levels of perceived corruption.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) identified 140 species of mammals as threatened and 15 as critically endangered, including the Bali myna,[116] Sumatran orangutan,[117] and Javan rhinoceros.[118] Some academics describe the deforestation and other environmental destruction in the country as an ecocide.[119][120][121]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIndonesia's size, tropical climate, and archipelagic geography support one of the world's highest levels of biodiversity, and it is among the 17 megadiverse countries identified by Conservation International. Its flora and fauna are a mixture of Asian and Australasian species.[98][99] The Sunda Shelf islands (Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and Bali) were once linked to mainland Asia and have a wealth of Asian fauna. Large species such as the Sumatran tiger, rhinoceros, orangutan, Asian elephant, and leopard were once abundant as far east as Bali, but numbers and distribution have dwindled drastically. Having been long separated from the continental landmasses, Sulawesi, Nusa Tenggara, and Maluku have developed their unique flora and fauna.[100][101] Papua was part of the Australian landmass and is home to a unique fauna and flora closely related to that of Australia, including over 600 bird species.[102]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n150. **^** \"Indonesia \u2013 Foreign Policy\".

Indonesia's first appearance at the AFC Asian Cup was in 1996 and successfully qualified for a total of five tournaments, although they never make the knockout phase.[348]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIndonesia is second only to Australia in terms of total endemic species, with 36% of its 1,531 species of bird and 39% of its 515 species of mammal being endemic.[103] Tropical seas surround Indonesia's 80,000 kilometres (50,000 miles) of coastline. The country has a range of sea and coastal ecosystems, including beaches, dunes, estuaries, mangroves, coral reefs, seagrass beds, coastal mudflats, tidal flats, algal beds, and small island ecosystems.[12] Indonesia is one of the Coral Triangle countries with the world's most enormous diversity of coral reef fish, with more than 1,650 species in eastern Indonesia only.[104]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)University of Indonesia is one of Indonesia's top universities\nEducation is compulsory for 12 years.[277] Parents can choose between state-run, non-sectarian schools or private or semi-private religious (usually Islamic) schools, supervised by the ministries of Education and Religion, respectively.[278] Private international schools that do not follow the national curriculum are also available. The enrolment rate is 93% for primary education, 79% for secondary education, and 36% for tertiary education (2018).[279] The literacy rate is 96% (2018), and the government spends about 3.6% of GDP (2015) on education.[279] In 2018, there were 4,670 higher educational institutions in Indonesia, with most (74%) located in Sumatra and Java.[280][281] According to the QS World University Rankings, Indonesia's top universities are the University of Indonesia, Gadjah Mada University and the Bandung Institute of Technology.[282]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIndonesia has been a member of the United Nations since 1950[c] and was a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).[153] Indonesia is a signatory to the ASEAN Free Trade Area agreement, the Cairns Group, the World Trade Organization (WTO), and a former member of OPEC.[154] Indonesia has been a humanitarian and development aid recipient since 1967,[155][156] and recently, the country established its first overseas aid programme in late 2019.[157]\n\n\n\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Indonesian National Armed Forces and Military history of Indonesia\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nIndonesian Armed Forces. **Clockwise from top**: Indonesian Army during training session; Sukhoi Su-30; Pindad Anoa; and Indonesian naval vessel Error: {{Ship}} invalid control parameter: 4 (help).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nAsia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)\n |\n| --- |\n| Nations | * Australia\n* Brunei\n* Canada\n* Chile\n* China\n* Hong Kong\u00b9\n* Indonesia\n* Japan\n* South Korea\n* Malaysia\n* Mexico\n* New Zealand\n* Papua New Guinea\n* Peru\n* Philippines\n* Russia\n* Singapore\n* Taiwan\n* Thailand\n* United States\n* Vietnam\n |\n| Summits | * 1989\n* 1990\n* 1991\n* 1992\n* 1993\n* 1994\n* 1995\n* 1996\n* 1997\n* 1998\n* 1999\n* 2000\n* 2001\n* 2002\n* 2003\n* 2004\n* 2005\n* 2006\n* 2007\n* 2008\n* 2009\n* 2010\n* 2011\n* 2012\n* 2013\n* 2014\n* 2015\n* 2016\n* 2017\n* 2018\n* 2019\n* 2020\n* 2021\n* 2022\n* 2023\n* *2024*\n |\n| Other | * APEC Business Travel Card\n* APEC blue\n* APEC Climate Center\n* APEC Sculpture Garden\n* APEC Youth Science Festival\n |\n| * 1.

LGBT people also regularly face challenges. Although LGBT issues have been relatively obscure, the 2010s (especially after 2016) has seen a rapid surge of anti-LGBT rhetoric, putting LGBT Indonesians into a frequent subject of intimidation, discrimination, and even violence.[293][294] In addition, Indonesia has been reported to have sizeable numbers of child and forced labourers, with the former being prevalent in the palm oil and tobacco industries, while the latter in the fishing industry.[295][296]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Indonesia\n See also: National Intangible Cultural Heritage of Indonesia and Public holidays in Indonesia\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIndonesia was the country hardest hit by the 1997 Asian financial crisis.[66] It brought out popular discontent with the New Order's corruption and suppression of political opposition and ultimately ended Suharto's presidency.[41][67][68][69] In 1999, East Timor seceded from Indonesia, following its 1975 invasion by Indonesia[70] and a 25-year occupation marked by international condemnation of human rights abuses.[71]\n\n\nSince 1998, democratic processes have been strengthened by enhancing regional autonomy and instituting the country's first direct presidential election in 2004.[72] Political, economic and social instability, corruption, and instances of terrorism remained problems in the 2000s; however, the economy has performed strongly since 2007. Although relations among the diverse population are mostly harmonious, acute sectarian discontent and violence remain problematic in some areas.[73] A political settlement to an armed separatist conflict in Aceh was achieved in 2005.[74]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe country's official language is Indonesian, a variant of Malay based on its prestige dialect, which had been the archipelago's *lingua franca* for centuries. It was promoted by nationalists in the 1920s and achieved official status in 1945 under the name *Bahasa Indonesia*.[232] Due to centuries-long contact with other languages, it is rich in local and foreign influences.[e] Nearly every Indonesian speaks the language due to its widespread use in education, academics, communications, business, politics, and mass media. Most Indonesians also speak at least one of more than 700 local languages,[1] often as their first language. Most belong to the Austronesian language family, while over 270 Papuan languages are spoken in eastern Indonesia.[1] Of these, Javanese is the most widely spoken[77] and has co-official status in the Special Region of Yogyakarta.[236]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Riots on the streets of Jakarta on 14 May 1998\nIn the economic sphere, there is a gap in wealth, unemployment rate, and health between densely populated islands and economic centres (such as Sumatra and Java) and sparsely populated, disadvantaged areas (such as Maluku and Papua).[288][289] This is created by a situation in which nearly 80% of Indonesia's population lives in the western parts of the archipelago[290] and yet grows slower than the rest of the country.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIndonesia was a significant battleground during the Cold War. Numerous attempts by the United States and the Soviet Union,[146][147] and China to some degree,[148] culminated in the 1965 coup attempt and subsequent upheaval that led to a reorientation of foreign policy.[149] Quiet alignment with the Western world while maintaining a non-aligned stance has characterised Indonesia's foreign policy since then.[150] Today, it maintains close relations with its neighbours and is a founding member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the East Asia Summit. In common with most of the Muslim world, Indonesia does not have diplomatic relations with Israel and has actively supported Palestine. However, observers have pointed out that Indonesia has ties with Israel, albeit discreetly.[151]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nCountries and dependencies of Asia\n |\n| --- |\n| Sovereign states | * Afghanistan\n* Armenia2\n* Azerbaijan1\n* Bahrain\n* Bangladesh\n* Bhutan\n* Brunei\n* Cambodia\n* China\n* Cyprus2\n* East Timor\n* Egypt1\n* Georgia1\n* India\n* Indonesia1\n* Iran\n* Iraq\n* Israel\n* Japan\n* Jordan\n* Kazakhstan1\n* North Korea\n* South Korea\n* Kuwait\n* Kyrgyzstan\n* Laos\n* Lebanon\n* Malaysia\n* Maldives\n* Mongolia\n* Myanmar\n* Nepal\n* Oman\n* Pakistan\n* Philippines\n* Qatar\n* Russia1\n* Saudi Arabia\n* Singapore\n* Sri Lanka\n* Syria\n* Tajikistan\n* Thailand\n* Turkey1\n* Turkmenistan\n* United Arab Emirates\n* Uzbekistan\n* Vietnam\n* Yemen\n | ![](image)\n |\n| States with limitedrecognition\n | * Abkhazia2\n* Northern Cyprus2\n* Palestine\n* South Ossetia2\n* Taiwan\n |\n| Dependentterritories\n | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Australia | * Christmas Island\n* Cocos (Keeling) Islands\n |\n| Greece | * Kastellorizo\n |\n| United Kingdom | * Akrotiri and Dhekelia2 (Sovereign Base Areas)\n* British Indian Ocean Territory (British Overseas Territory)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n113. **^** Austin, Kemen G; Schwantes, Amanda; Gu, Yaofeng; Kasibhatla, Prasad D (1 February 2019). \"What causes deforestation in Indonesia?\". *Environmental Research Letters*. **14** (2): 024007.

Also, the Dutch language never had a substantial number of speakers or official status despite the Dutch presence for almost 350 years.[238] The small minorities that can speak it or Dutch-based creole languages fluently are the aforementioned ethnic groups and descendants of Dutch colonisers. This reflected the Dutch colonial empire's primary purpose, which was commercial exchange as opposed to sovereignty over homogeneous landmasses.[239] Today, there is some degree of fluency by either educated members of the oldest generation or legal professionals,[240] as specific law codes are still only available in Dutch.[241]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Indonesia\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain articles: Geography of Indonesia and List of islands of Indonesia\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n296. **^** *Global Slavery Index 2018*.

Between 1998 and 2017, the average annual population growth rate stood at +2.40%.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDramatic social changes have led to urbanization and the emergence of two megacities: Karachi and Lahore. The country's urban population more than tripled between 1981 and 2017 (from 23.8\u00a0million to 75.7\u00a0million), as Pakistan's urbanisation rate rose from 28.2% to 36.4%. Even with this, the nation's urbanisation rate remains one of the lowest in the world, and in 2017, over 130 million Pakistanis (making up nearly 65% of the population) lived in rural areas.\n\n\nDue to a high fertility rate, which was estimated at 3.5 in 2022, Pakistan has one of the world's youngest populations. The 2017 census recorded that 40.3% of the country's population was under the age of 15, while only 3.7% of Pakistanis were aged 65 or more.[447] The median age of the country was 19,[447] while its sex ratio was recorded to be 105 males per 100 females.[443]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEnergy consumption by computers and usage has grown since the 1990s when PCs were introduced; Pakistan has about 82\u00a0million Internet users and is ranked as one of the top countries that have registered a high growth rate in Internet penetration as of 2020[update].[344] Key publications have been produced by Pakistan, and domestic software development has gained considerable international praise.[423]\n\n\nAs of May 2020, Pakistan has about 82\u00a0million internet users, making it the 9th-largest population of Internet users in the world.[344][345] Since the 2000s Pakistan has made a significant amount of progress in supercomputing, and various institutions offer research opportunities in parallel computing. The Pakistan government reportedly spends \u20a8 4.6\u00a0billion on information technology projects, with emphasis on e-government, human resources, and infrastructure development.[424]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHinduism is the second-largest religion in Pakistan after Islam and is followed by 2.14% of the population according to the 2017 census.[506][507] According to the 2010 Pew report, Pakistan had the fifth-largest Hindu population in the world.[508] In the 2017 census, the Hindu population was found to be 4,444,437.[509] Hindus are found in all provinces of Pakistan but are mostly concentrated in Sindh, where they account for 8.73% of the population.[506] Umerkot district (52.15%) is the only Hindu majority district in Pakistan. Tharparkar district has the highest population of Hindus in terms of absolute terms. Four districts in Sindh \u2013 Umerkot, Tharparkar, Mirpurkhas and Sanghar hosts more than half of the Hindu population in Pakistan.[500]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 10 | Quetta | Balochistan | 1,001,205 | 20 | Gujrat | Punjab | 390,533\n |\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Pakistan\n\n| Religions in Pakistan (2017 Census)[454][479][480][481][482] |\n| --- |\n| Religions |  | Percent |\n| Islam |  | 96.47% |\n| Hinduism |  | 2.14% |\n| Christianity |  | 1.27% |\n| others/non-religious |  | 0.11% |\n\nIslam is the state religion of Pakistan.[483] Freedom of religion is guaranteed by the constitution, which provides all its citizens the right to profess, practice and propagate their religion subject to law, public order, and morality.[484]\n\n\nThe majority of Pakistanis are Muslims (96.47%) followed by Hindus (2.14%) and Christians (1.27%).

There is a Roman Catholic community in Karachi that was established by Goan and Tamil migrants when Karachi's infrastructure was being developed by the British during the colonial administration between World War I and World War II.[500]\n\n\nAfter Christianity, the largest religion is the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith, which had a following of 30,000 in 2008, followed by Sikhism, Buddhism, and Zoroastrianism, each claiming roughly 20,000 adherents in 2008,[514] and a very small community of Jains.\n\n\nOne of percent of the population identified as atheist in 2005.

It is an ethnically and linguistically diverse country, with similarly diverse geography and wildlife. The country continues to face challenges, including poverty, illiteracy, corruption and terrorism.[32] Pakistan is a member of the United Nations, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, the Commonwealth of Nations, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, and the Islamic Military Counter-Terrorism Coalition, and is designated as a major non-NATO ally by the United States.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPakistan Super League is one of the largest cricket leagues of the world with a brand value of about Rs.\u00a032.26 billion (US$110\u00a0million).[567]\n\n\nAssociation football is the second-most played sports in Pakistan, and is organised and regulated by the Pakistan Football Federation.[568] Football in Pakistan is as old as the country itself.

Despite Urdu being Pakistan's lingua franca, estimates on how many languages are spoken in the country range from 75 to 85,[448][449] and in 2017, the country's three largest ethnolinguistic groups were the Punjabis (making up 38.8% of the total population), the Pashtuns (18.2%), and the Sindhis (14.6%).[450] Pakistan is also thought to have the world's fourth-largest refugee population, estimated at 1.4\u00a0million in mid-2021 by the UNHCR.[451]\n\n### Ethnicity and languages[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Languages of Pakistan and Ethnic groups in Pakistan\n\nSee also: Pakistanis\n\n![](image)Dominant Ethnolinguistic Group in each Pakistani District as of the 2017 Pakistan Census[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn recent years, after decades of social instability, as of 2013[update], serious deficiencies in macromanagement and unbalanced macroeconomics in basic services such as rail transportation and electrical energy generation have developed.[301] The economy is considered to be semi-industrialized, with centres of growth along the Indus River.[302][303][304] The diversified economies of Karachi and Punjab's urban centres coexist with less-developed areas in other parts of the country, particularly in Balochistan.[303] According to the Economic complexity index, Pakistan is the 67th-largest export economy in the world and the 106th-most complex economy.[305] During the fiscal year 2015\u201316, Pakistan's exports stood at US$20.81\u00a0billion and imports at US$44.76\u00a0billion, resulting in a negative trade balance of US$23.96\u00a0billion.[306]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | ![Increase](image) $6,773[11] (168th) |\n| GDP\u00a0(nominal) | 2023\u00a0estimate |\n| \u2022\u00a0Total\n | ![Decrease](image) $340.636 billion[11] (42nd) |\n| \u2022\u00a0Per capita\n | ![Decrease](image) $1,471[11] (177th) |\n| Gini\u00a0(2018) | ![Positive decrease](image)\u00a031.6[12]medium |\n| HDI\u00a0(2022) | ![Increase](image)\u00a00.544[13]low\u00a0(161st) |\n| Currency | Pakistani rupee (\u20a8) (PKR) |\n| Time zone | UTC+05:00 (PKT) |\n|  | *DST is not observed* |\n| Date format | * dd-mm-yyyy[c]\n |\n| Driving side | left[14] |\n| Calling code | +92 |\n| ISO 3166 code | PK |\n| Internet TLD | * .pk\n* \u067e\u0627\u06a9\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646.\n |\n\n\n![](image)\n\nYou may need rendering support to display the Urdu text in this article correctly.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCountry in South Asia\n\nThis article is about the country in South Asia.

Countries like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan have enough influence to not be considered small, but not enough to be major powers. Within the limits of their regions, they play a significant political role. Thus instinctively, they would qualify as middle powers. While it is not the objective here to question the characteristics of Jordan's definition of middle powers, we argue that Pakistan is in fact a middle power despite its being nuclear-armed. When looking at the numbers, for instance, it appears that Saudi Arabia and Pakistan can be classified as middle powers (see in this regard Ping, 2007).\n30. **^** Iqbal, Anwar (8 November 2015). \"Pakistan an emerging market economy: IMF\". *www.dawn.com*.
