He speculated that \"inflammable air\" was in fact identical to the hypothetical substance called \"phlogiston\"[80][81] and further finding in 1781 that the gas produces water when burned. He is usually given credit for the discovery of hydrogen as an element.[7][8] In 1783, Antoine Lavoisier gave the element the name hydrogen (from the Greek ὑδρο- *hydro* meaning \"water\" and -γενής *genes* meaning \"former\")[82] when he and Laplace reproduced Cavendish's finding that water is produced when hydrogen is burned.[8]\n\n\n\n![](image)Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier\nLavoisier produced hydrogen for his experiments on mass conservation by reacting a flux of steam with metallic iron through an incandescent iron tube heated in a fire.

Edward Daniel Clarke invented the hydrogen gas blowpipe in 1819. The Döbereiner's lamp and limelight were invented in 1823.[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Francium | Radium | Actinium | Thorium | Protactinium | Uranium | Neptunium | Plutonium | Americium | Curium | Berkelium | Californium | Einsteinium | Fermium | Mendelevium | Nobelium | Lawrencium | Rutherfordium | Dubnium | Seaborgium | Bohrium | Hassium | Meitnerium | Darmstadtium | Roentgenium | Copernicium | Nihonium | Flerovium | Moscovium | Livermorium | Tennessine | Oganesson |\n | –↑**H**↓Li |\n| (none) ← **hydrogen** → helium |\n\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n47. **^** Kirchheim, R.; Mutschele, T.; Kieninger, W.; Gleiter, H.; Birringer, R.; Koble, T.

Hydrogen is the most abundant chemical substance in the universe, constituting roughly 75% of all normal matter.[12][note 1] Stars such as the Sun are mainly composed of hydrogen in the plasma state. Most of the hydrogen on Earth exists in molecular forms such as water and organic compounds.

Hydrogen gas is very rare in the Earth's atmosphere (around 0.53 ppm on a molar basis[98]) because of its light weight, which enables it to escape from the atmosphere more rapidly than heavier gases. However, hydrogen is the third most abundant element on the Earth's surface,[99] mostly in the form of chemical compounds such as hydrocarbons and water.[53]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHydrogen is the most abundant element in the human body in terms of numbers of atoms of the element but the third most abundant element by mass. H2 occurs in the breath of humans due to the metabolic activity of hydrogenase-containing microorganisms in the large intestine and is a natural component of flatus. The concentration in the breath of fasting people at rest is typically less than 5 parts per million (ppm) but can be 50 ppm when people with intestinal disorders consume molecules they cannot absorb during diagnostic hydrogen breath tests.[157]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOne of the first quantum effects to be explicitly noticed (but not understood at the time) was a Maxwell observation involving hydrogen, half a century before full quantum mechanical theory arrived. Maxwell observed that the specific heat capacity of H2 unaccountably departs from that of a diatomic gas below room temperature and begins to increasingly resemble that of a monatomic gas at cryogenic temperatures. According to quantum theory, this behavior arises from the spacing of the (quantized) rotational energy levels, which are particularly wide-spaced in H2 because of its low mass. These widely spaced levels inhibit equal partition of heat energy into rotational motion in hydrogen at low temperatures. Diatomic gases composed of heavier atoms do not have such widely spaced levels and do not exhibit the same effect.[91]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n55. **^** Perdoncin, G.; Scorrano, G.

Many metals react with water to produce H2, but the rate of hydrogen evolution depends on the metal, the pH, and the presence of alloying agents. Most commonly, hydrogen evolution is induced by acids. The alkali and alkaline earth metals, aluminium, zinc, manganese, and iron react readily with aqueous acids. This reaction is the basis of the Kipp's apparatus, which once was used as a laboratory gas source:\n\n\n\nZn + 2 H+ → Zn2+ + H2\nIn the absence of acid, the evolution of H2 is slower. Because iron is widely used structural material, its anaerobic corrosion is of technological significance:\n\n\n\nFe + 2 H2O → Fe(OH)2 + H2\nMany metals, such as aluminium, are slow to react with water because they form passivated coatings of oxides. An alloy of aluminium and gallium, however, does react with water.[122] At high pH, aluminium can produce H2:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![A line spectrum showing black background with narrow lines superimposed on it: one violet, one blue, one cyan, and one red.](image)Hydrogen emission spectrum lines in the visible range.

However, the atomic electron and proton are held together by electromagnetic force, while planets and celestial objects are held by gravity.

The thermodynamic basis of this low reactivity is the very strong H–H bond, with a bond dissociation energy of 435.7 kJ/mol.[26] The kinetic basis of the low reactivity is the nonpolar nature of H2 and its weak polarizability. It spontaneously reacts with chlorine and fluorine to form hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride, respectively.[27] The reactivity of H2 is strongly affected by the presence of metal catalysts. Thus, while mixtures of H2 with O2 or air combust readily when heated to at least 500 °C by a spark or flame, they do not react at room temperature in the absence of a catalyst.\n\n\n\n### Electron energy levels[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hydrogen atom\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Hydrogen gas is colorless and transparent, here contained in a glass ampoule.\n![Phase diagram of hydrogen on logarithmic scales.

Hydrogen plays a particularly important role in acid–base reactions because these reactions usually involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules. In ionic compounds, hydrogen can take the form of a negative charge (i.e., anion) where it is known as a hydride, or as a positively charged (i.e., cation) species denoted by the symbol H+. The H+ cation is simply a proton (symbol **p**) but its behavior in aqueous solutions and in ionic compounds involves screening of its electric charge by nearby polar molecules or anions. Because hydrogen is the only neutral atom for which the Schrödinger equation can be solved analytically,[14] the study of its energetics and chemical bonding has played a key role in the development of quantum mechanics.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n98. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Rhys Grinter; Kropp, A.; Venugopal; et al.

This ion has also been observed in the upper atmosphere of the planet Jupiter. The ion is relatively stable in the environment of outer space due to the low temperature and density.

The term \"hydride\" suggests that the H atom has acquired a negative or anionic character, denoted H−, and is used when hydrogen forms a compound with a more electropositive element. The existence of the hydride anion, suggested by Gilbert N. Lewis in 1916 for group 1 and 2 salt-like hydrides, was demonstrated by Moers in 1920 by the electrolysis of molten lithium hydride (LiH), producing a stoichiometric quantity of hydrogen at the anode.[50] For hydrides other than group 1 and 2 metals, the term is quite misleading, considering the low electronegativity of hydrogen. An exception in group 2 hydrides is BeH2, which is polymeric. In lithium aluminium hydride, the [AlH4]− anion carries hydridic centers firmly attached to the Al(III).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAntihydrogen (  \nH  \n) is the antimatter counterpart to hydrogen.

Edward Daniel Clarke invented the hydrogen gas blowpipe in 1819. The Döbereiner's lamp and limelight were invented in 1823.[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Francium | Radium | Actinium | Thorium | Protactinium | Uranium | Neptunium | Plutonium | Americium | Curium | Berkelium | Californium | Einsteinium | Fermium | Mendelevium | Nobelium | Lawrencium | Rutherfordium | Dubnium | Seaborgium | Bohrium | Hassium | Meitnerium | Darmstadtium | Roentgenium | Copernicium | Nihonium | Flerovium | Moscovium | Livermorium | Tennessine | Oganesson |\n | –↑**H**↓Li |\n| (none) ← **hydrogen** → helium |\n\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n47. **^** Kirchheim, R.; Mutschele, T.; Kieninger, W.; Gleiter, H.; Birringer, R.; Koble, T.

Hydrogen gas is very rare in the Earth's atmosphere (around 0.53 ppm on a molar basis[98]) because of its light weight, which enables it to escape from the atmosphere more rapidly than heavier gases. However, hydrogen is the third most abundant element on the Earth's surface,[99] mostly in the form of chemical compounds such as hydrocarbons and water.[53]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHydrogen is the most abundant element in the human body in terms of numbers of atoms of the element but the third most abundant element by mass. H2 occurs in the breath of humans due to the metabolic activity of hydrogenase-containing microorganisms in the large intestine and is a natural component of flatus. The concentration in the breath of fasting people at rest is typically less than 5 parts per million (ppm) but can be 50 ppm when people with intestinal disorders consume molecules they cannot absorb during diagnostic hydrogen breath tests.[157]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOne of the first quantum effects to be explicitly noticed (but not understood at the time) was a Maxwell observation involving hydrogen, half a century before full quantum mechanical theory arrived. Maxwell observed that the specific heat capacity of H2 unaccountably departs from that of a diatomic gas below room temperature and begins to increasingly resemble that of a monatomic gas at cryogenic temperatures. According to quantum theory, this behavior arises from the spacing of the (quantized) rotational energy levels, which are particularly wide-spaced in H2 because of its low mass. These widely spaced levels inhibit equal partition of heat energy into rotational motion in hydrogen at low temperatures. Diatomic gases composed of heavier atoms do not have such widely spaced levels and do not exhibit the same effect.[91]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n55. **^** Perdoncin, G.; Scorrano, G.

Many metals react with water to produce H2, but the rate of hydrogen evolution depends on the metal, the pH, and the presence of alloying agents. Most commonly, hydrogen evolution is induced by acids. The alkali and alkaline earth metals, aluminium, zinc, manganese, and iron react readily with aqueous acids. This reaction is the basis of the Kipp's apparatus, which once was used as a laboratory gas source:\n\n\n\nZn + 2 H+ → Zn2+ + H2\nIn the absence of acid, the evolution of H2 is slower. Because iron is widely used structural material, its anaerobic corrosion is of technological significance:\n\n\n\nFe + 2 H2O → Fe(OH)2 + H2\nMany metals, such as aluminium, are slow to react with water because they form passivated coatings of oxides. An alloy of aluminium and gallium, however, does react with water.[122] At high pH, aluminium can produce H2:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![A line spectrum showing black background with narrow lines superimposed on it: one violet, one blue, one cyan, and one red.](image)Hydrogen emission spectrum lines in the visible range.

This function is particularly common in group 13 elements, especially in boranes (boron hydrides) and aluminium complexes, as well as in clustered carboranes.[53]\n\n\n\n#### Protons and acids[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Acid–base reaction\n\nOxidation of hydrogen removes its electron and gives H+, which contains no electrons and a nucleus which is usually composed of one proton. That is why H+ is often called a proton. This species is central to discussion of acids. Under the Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory, acids are proton donors, while bases are proton acceptors.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n33. **^** Green, Richard A.; et al.

The thermodynamic basis of this low reactivity is the very strong H–H bond, with a bond dissociation energy of 435.7 kJ/mol.[26] The kinetic basis of the low reactivity is the nonpolar nature of H2 and its weak polarizability. It spontaneously reacts with chlorine and fluorine to form hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride, respectively.[27] The reactivity of H2 is strongly affected by the presence of metal catalysts. Thus, while mixtures of H2 with O2 or air combust readily when heated to at least 500 °C by a spark or flame, they do not react at room temperature in the absence of a catalyst.\n\n\n\n### Electron energy levels[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hydrogen atom\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Hydrogen gas is colorless and transparent, here contained in a glass ampoule.\n![Phase diagram of hydrogen on logarithmic scales.

Hydrogen plays a particularly important role in acid–base reactions because these reactions usually involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules. In ionic compounds, hydrogen can take the form of a negative charge (i.e., anion) where it is known as a hydride, or as a positively charged (i.e., cation) species denoted by the symbol H+. The H+ cation is simply a proton (symbol **p**) but its behavior in aqueous solutions and in ionic compounds involves screening of its electric charge by nearby polar molecules or anions. Because hydrogen is the only neutral atom for which the Schrödinger equation can be solved analytically,[14] the study of its energetics and chemical bonding has played a key role in the development of quantum mechanics.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n98. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Rhys Grinter; Kropp, A.; Venugopal; et al.

The term \"hydride\" suggests that the H atom has acquired a negative or anionic character, denoted H−, and is used when hydrogen forms a compound with a more electropositive element. The existence of the hydride anion, suggested by Gilbert N. Lewis in 1916 for group 1 and 2 salt-like hydrides, was demonstrated by Moers in 1920 by the electrolysis of molten lithium hydride (LiH), producing a stoichiometric quantity of hydrogen at the anode.[50] For hydrides other than group 1 and 2 metals, the term is quite misleading, considering the low electronegativity of hydrogen. An exception in group 2 hydrides is BeH2, which is polymeric. In lithium aluminium hydride, the [AlH4]− anion carries hydridic centers firmly attached to the Al(III).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAntihydrogen (  \nH  \n) is the antimatter counterpart to hydrogen.

T. Haig,[14] Norman R. Pogson,[15] and Lieutenant John Herschel,[16] and was subsequently confirmed by French astronomer Jules Janssen.[17] Janssen is often jointly credited with detecting the element, along with Norman Lockyer. Janssen recorded the helium spectral line during the solar eclipse of 1868, while Lockyer observed it from Britain. Lockyer was the first to propose that the line was due to a new element, which he named after the Sun. The formal discovery of the element was made in 1895 by chemists Sir William Ramsay, Per Teodor Cleve, and Nils Abraham Langlet, who found helium emanating from the uranium ore cleveite, which is now not regarded as a separate mineral species, but as a variety of uraninite.[18][19] In 1903, large reserves of helium were found in natural gas fields in parts of the United States, by far the largest supplier of the gas today.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nPeriodic table\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | 1 | 2 |  | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 |\n| 1 | H |  | He |\n| 2 | Li | Be |  | B | C | N | O | F | Ne |\n| 3 | Na | Mg |  | Al | Si | P | S | Cl | Ar |\n| 4 | K | Ca |  | Sc | Ti | V | Cr | Mn | Fe | Co | Ni | Cu | Zn | Ga | Ge | As | Se | Br | Kr |\n| 5 | Rb | Sr |  | Y | Zr | Nb | Mo | Tc | Ru | Rh | Pd | Ag | Cd | In | Sn | Sb | Te | I | Xe |\n| 6 | Cs | Ba | La | Ce | Pr | Nd | Pm | Sm | Eu | Gd | Tb | Dy | Ho | Er | Tm | Yb | Lu | Hf | Ta | W | Re | Os | Ir | Pt | Au | Hg | Tl | Pb | Bi | Po | At | Rn |\n| 7 | Fr | Ra | Ac | Th | Pa | U | Np | Pu | Am | Cm | Bk | Cf | Es | Fm | Md | No | Lr | Rf | Db | Sg | Bh | Hs | Mt | Ds | Rg | Cn | Nh | Fl | Mc | Lv | Ts | Og |\n |\n| |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Potassium | Calcium |  | Scandium | Titanium | Vanadium | Chromium | Manganese | Iron | Cobalt | Nickel | Copper | Zinc | Gallium | Germanium | Arsenic | Selenium | Bromine | Krypton |\n| Rubidium | Strontium |  |  | Yttrium | Zirconium | Niobium | Molybdenum | Technetium | Ruthenium | Rhodium | Palladium | Silver | Cadmium | Indium | Tin | Antimony | Tellurium | Iodine | Xenon |\n| Caesium | Barium | Lanthanum | Cerium | Praseodymium | Neodymium | Promethium | Samarium | Europium | Gadolinium | Terbium | Dysprosium | Holmium | Erbium | Thulium | Ytterbium | Lutetium | Hafnium | Tantalum | Tungsten | Rhenium | Osmium | Iridium | Platinum | Gold | Mercury (element) | Thallium | Lead | Bismuth | Polonium | Astatine | Radon |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Kondev, F.

They do so on the grounds of helium's 1s2 electron configuration, which is analogous to the ns2 valence configurations of the alkaline earth metals, and furthermore point to some specific trends that are more regular with helium than beryllium.[7][8][9][10][11] However, the classification of helium with the other noble gases remains near-universal, as its extraordinary inertness is extremely close to that of the other light noble gases neon and argon.[12]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAll heavier elements (including those necessary for rocky planets like the Earth, and for carbon-based or other life) have thus been created since the Big Bang in stars which were hot enough to fuse helium itself.

Helium-4, by contrast, makes up about 23% of the universe's ordinary matter—nearly all the ordinary matter that is not hydrogen.\n\n\n\n### Gas and plasma phases[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe first evidence of helium was observed on August 18, 1868, as a bright yellow line with a wavelength of 587.49 nanometers in the spectrum of the chromosphere of the Sun. The line was detected by French astronomer Jules Janssen during a total solar eclipse in Guntur, India.[25][26] This line was initially assumed to be sodium. On October 20 of the same year, English astronomer, Norman Lockyer, observed a yellow line in the solar spectrum, which, he named the D3 because it was near the known D1 and D2 Fraunhofer lines of sodium.[27][28] He concluded that it was caused by an element in the Sun unknown on Earth. Lockyer and English chemist Edward Frankland named the element with the Greek word for the Sun, ἥλιος (*helios*).[29][30]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTheoretically, other true compounds may be possible, such as helium fluorohydride (HHeF), which would be analogous to HArF, discovered in 2000.[118] Calculations show that two new compounds containing a helium-oxygen bond could be stable.[119] Two new molecular species, predicted using theory, CsFHeO and N(CH3)4FHeO, are derivatives of a metastable FHeO− anion first theorized in 2005 by a group from Taiwan. If confirmed by experiment, the only remaining element with no known stable compounds would be neon.[120]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Sir William Ramsay, the discoverer of terrestrial helium\n![](image)The cleveite sample from which Ramsay first purified helium[32]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n60. **^** Fowler, A.

Owing to the relatively tight binding of helium-4 nuclei, its production consumed nearly all of the free neutrons in a few minutes, before they could beta-decay, and thus few neutrons were available to form heavier atoms such as lithium, beryllium, or boron. Helium-4 nuclear binding per nucleon is stronger than in any of these elements (see nucleogenesis and binding energy) and thus, once helium had been formed, no energetic drive was available to make elements 3, 4 and 5.[87] It is barely energetically favorable for helium to fuse into the next element with a lower energy per nucleon, carbon. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n69. **^** Emme, Eugene M. comp., ed.

It is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, inert, monatomic gas and the first in the noble gas group in the periodic table.[a] Its boiling point is the lowest among all the elements, and it does not have a melting point at standard pressure. It is the second-lightest and second most abundant element in the observable universe, after hydrogen. It is present at about 24% of the total elemental mass, which is more than 12 times the mass of all the heavier elements combined. Its abundance is similar to this in both the Sun and Jupiter, because of the very high nuclear binding energy (per nucleon) of helium-4, with respect to the next three elements after helium. This helium-4 binding energy also accounts for why it is a product of both nuclear fusion and radioactive decay. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n### Natural abundance[edit]\n\n\nAlthough it is rare on Earth, helium is the second most abundant element in the known Universe, constituting 23% of its baryonic mass. Only hydrogen is more abundant.[26] The vast majority of helium was formed by Big Bang nucleosynthesis one to three minutes after the Big Bang. As such, measurements of its abundance contribute to cosmological models. In stars, it is formed by the nuclear fusion of hydrogen in proton–proton chain reactions and the CNO cycle, part of stellar nucleosynthesis.[106]\n\n\nIn the Earth's atmosphere, the concentration of helium by volume is only 5.2 parts per million.[125][126] The concentration is low and fairly constant despite the continuous production of new helium because most helium in the Earth's atmosphere escapes into space by several processes.[127][128][129] In the Earth's heterosphere, a part of the upper atmosphere, helium and other lighter gases are the most abundant elements.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![Illuminated light red gas discharge tubes shaped as letters H and e](image)Helium discharge tube shaped into 'He', the element's symbol.\nHelium is the second least reactive noble gas after neon, and thus the second least reactive of all elements.[88] It is chemically inert and monatomic in all standard conditions. Because of helium's relatively low molar (atomic) mass, its thermal conductivity, specific heat, and sound speed in the gas phase are all greater than any other gas except hydrogen. For these reasons and the small size of helium monatomic molecules, helium diffuses through solids at a rate three times that of air and around 65% that of hydrogen.[28]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n71. **^** Williamson, John G.

Most terrestrial helium present today is created by the natural radioactive decay of heavy radioactive elements (thorium and uranium, although there are other examples), as the alpha particles emitted by such decays consist of helium-4 nuclei. This radiogenic helium is trapped with natural gas in concentrations as great as 7% by volume, from which it is extracted commercially by a low-temperature separation process called fractional distillation. Terrestrial helium is a non-renewable resource because once released into the atmosphere, it promptly escapes into space. Its supply is thought to be rapidly diminishing.[21][22] However, some studies suggest that helium produced deep in the Earth by radioactive decay can collect in natural gas reserves in larger-than-expected quantities,[23] in some cases having been released by volcanic activity.[24]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Scientific discoveries[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHowever, subsequently, in an unpublished letter of 19 December 1868 to Charles Sainte-Claire Deville, Janssen asked Deville to inform the French Academy of Sciences that : \"Several observers have claimed the bright D line as forming part of the spectrum of the prominences on 18 August.

In 1972, the same phenomenon was observed in helium-3, but at temperatures much closer to absolute zero, by American physicists Douglas D. Osheroff, David M. Lee, and Robert C. Richardson. The phenomenon in helium-3 is thought to be related to pairing of helium-3 fermions to make bosons, in analogy to Cooper pairs of electrons producing superconductivity.[63]\n\n\nIn 1961, Vignos and Fairbank reported the existence of a different phase of solid helium-4, designated the gamma-phase.

In the Earth's atmosphere, one atom is 3  \nHe for every million that are 4  \nHe.[26] Unlike most elements, helium's isotopic abundance varies greatly by origin, due to the different formation processes. The most common isotope, helium-4, is produced on Earth by alpha decay of heavier radioactive elements; the alpha particles that emerge are fully ionized helium-4 nuclei. Helium-4 is an unusually stable nucleus because its nucleons are arranged into complete shells. It was also formed in enormous quantities during Big Bang nucleosynthesis.[106]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n31. **^** Palmieri, Luigi (1881). \"La riga dell'Helium apparsa in una recente sublimazione vesuviana\" [The line of helium appeared in a recently sublimated material [from Mt.] Vesuvius.]. *Rendiconto dell'Accademia delle Scienze Fisiche e Matematiche (Naples, Italy)*. **20**: 223.

Some stable helium-3 (two protons and one neutron) is produced in fusion reactions from hydrogen, but it is a very small fraction compared to the highly favorable helium-4.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the perspective of quantum mechanics, helium is the second simplest atom to model, following the hydrogen atom. Helium is composed of two electrons in atomic orbitals surrounding a nucleus containing two protons and (usually) two neutrons. As in Newtonian mechanics, no system that consists of more than two particles can be solved with an exact analytical mathematical approach (see 3-body problem) and helium is no exception. Thus, numerical mathematical methods are required, even to solve the system of one nucleus and two electrons. Such computational chemistry methods have been used to create a quantum mechanical picture of helium electron binding which is accurate to within < 2% of the correct value, in a few computational steps.[86] Such models show that each electron in helium partly screens the nucleus from the other, so that the effective nuclear charge *Z*eff which each electron sees is about 1.69 units, not the 2 charges of a classic \"bare\" helium nucleus.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Phase diagram of helium-4.

The drop of liquid at the bottom of the glass represents helium spontaneously escaping from the container over the side, to empty out of the container. The energy to drive this process is supplied by the potential energy of the falling helium.\nHelium liquifies when cooled below 4.2 K at atmospheric pressure. Unlike any other element, however, helium remains liquid down to a temperature of absolute zero. This is a direct effect of quantum mechanics: specifically, the zero point energy of the system is too high to allow freezing. Pressures above about 25 atmospheres are required to freeze it. There are two liquid phases: Helium I is a conventional liquid, and Helium II, which occurs at a lower temperature, is a superfluid. \n\n\n\n#### Helium I[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Structure of the helium hydride ion, HHe+\n![](image)Structure of the suspected fluoroheliate anion, OHeF−\nHelium has a valence of zero and is chemically unreactive under all normal conditions.[101] It is an electrical insulator unless ionized. As with the other noble gases, helium has metastable energy levels that allow it to remain ionized in an electrical discharge with a voltage below its ionization potential.[28] Helium can form unstable compounds, known as excimers, with tungsten, iodine, fluorine, sulfur, and phosphorus when it is subjected to a glow discharge, to electron bombardment, or reduced to plasma by other means.

There was thus no time for significant carbon to be formed in the few minutes after the Big Bang, before the early expanding universe cooled to the temperature and pressure point where helium fusion to carbon was no longer possible. This left the early universe with a very similar ratio of hydrogen/helium as is observed today (3 parts hydrogen to 1 part helium-4 by mass), with nearly all the neutrons in the universe trapped in helium-4.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* Janssen (1868) \"Indication de quelques-uns des résultats obtenus à Cocanada, pendant l'éclipse du mois d'août dernier, et à la suite de cette éclipse\" (Information on some of the results obtained at Cocanada, during the eclipse of the month of last August, and following that eclipse), *Comptes rendus* ... , **67** : 838–839.\n\t* Wheeler M.

High-energy electron-scattering experiments show its charge to decrease exponentially from a maximum at a central point, exactly as does the charge density of helium's own electron cloud. This symmetry reflects similar underlying physics: the pair of neutrons and the pair of protons in helium's nucleus obey the same quantum mechanical rules as do helium's pair of electrons (although the nuclear particles are subject to a different nuclear binding potential), so that all these fermions fully occupy 1s orbitals in pairs, none of them possessing orbital angular momentum, and each cancelling the other's intrinsic spin. Adding another of any of these particles would require angular momentum and would release substantially less energy (in fact, no nucleus with five nucleons is stable). This arrangement is thus energetically extremely stable for all these particles, and this stability accounts for many crucial facts regarding helium in nature.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n have been created this way.[116] HeH+ is also stable in its ground state, but is extremely reactive—it is the strongest Brønsted acid known, and therefore can exist only in isolation, as it will protonate any molecule or counteranion it contacts.

Helium-7 and helium-8 are created in certain nuclear reactions.[28] Helium-6 and helium-8 are known to exhibit a nuclear halo.[28]\n\n\n\n### Properties[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Historical marker, denoting a massive helium find near Dexter, Kansas\nAfter an oil drilling operation in 1903 in Dexter, Kansas produced a gas geyser that would not burn, Kansas state geologist Erasmus Haworth collected samples of the escaping gas and took them back to the University of Kansas at Lawrence where, with the help of chemists Hamilton Cady and David McFarland, he discovered that the gas consisted of, by volume, 72% nitrogen, 15% methane (a combustible percentage only with sufficient oxygen), 1% hydrogen, and 12% an unidentifiable gas.[26][65] With further analysis, Cady and McFarland discovered that 1.84% of the gas sample was helium.[66][67] This showed that despite its overall rarity on Earth, helium was concentrated in large quantities under the American Great Plains, available for extraction as a byproduct of natural gas.[68]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n#### Related stability of the helium-4 nucleus and electron shell[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2013, Qatar started up the world's largest helium unit,[82] although the 2017 Qatar diplomatic crisis severely affected helium production there.[83] 2014 was widely acknowledged to be a year of over-supply in the helium business, following years of renowned shortages.[84] Nasdaq reported (2015) that for Air Products, an international corporation that sells gases for industrial use, helium volumes remain under economic pressure due to feedstock supply constraints.[85]\n\n\n\n## Characteristics[edit]\n\n\n### Atom[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Helium atom\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

The endohedral fullerene molecules formed are stable at high temperatures. When chemical derivatives of these fullerenes are formed, the helium stays inside.[121] If helium-3 is used, it can be readily observed by helium nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.[122] Many fullerenes containing helium-3 have been reported. Although the helium atoms are not attached by covalent or ionic bonds, these substances have distinct properties and a definite composition, like all stoichiometric chemical compounds.\n\n\nUnder high pressures helium can form compounds with various other elements. Helium-nitrogen clathrate (He(N2)11) crystals have been grown at room temperature at pressures ca. 10 GPa in a diamond anvil cell.[123] The insulating electride Na2He has been shown to be thermodynamically stable at pressures above 113 GPa.

T. Haig,[14] Norman R. Pogson,[15] and Lieutenant John Herschel,[16] and was subsequently confirmed by French astronomer Jules Janssen.[17] Janssen is often jointly credited with detecting the element, along with Norman Lockyer. Janssen recorded the helium spectral line during the solar eclipse of 1868, while Lockyer observed it from Britain. Lockyer was the first to propose that the line was due to a new element, which he named after the Sun. The formal discovery of the element was made in 1895 by chemists Sir William Ramsay, Per Teodor Cleve, and Nils Abraham Langlet, who found helium emanating from the uranium ore cleveite, which is now not regarded as a separate mineral species, but as a variety of uraninite.[18][19] In 1903, large reserves of helium were found in natural gas fields in parts of the United States, by far the largest supplier of the gas today.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nPeriodic table\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | 1 | 2 |  | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 |\n| 1 | H |  | He |\n| 2 | Li | Be |  | B | C | N | O | F | Ne |\n| 3 | Na | Mg |  | Al | Si | P | S | Cl | Ar |\n| 4 | K | Ca |  | Sc | Ti | V | Cr | Mn | Fe | Co | Ni | Cu | Zn | Ga | Ge | As | Se | Br | Kr |\n| 5 | Rb | Sr |  | Y | Zr | Nb | Mo | Tc | Ru | Rh | Pd | Ag | Cd | In | Sn | Sb | Te | I | Xe |\n| 6 | Cs | Ba | La | Ce | Pr | Nd | Pm | Sm | Eu | Gd | Tb | Dy | Ho | Er | Tm | Yb | Lu | Hf | Ta | W | Re | Os | Ir | Pt | Au | Hg | Tl | Pb | Bi | Po | At | Rn |\n| 7 | Fr | Ra | Ac | Th | Pa | U | Np | Pu | Am | Cm | Bk | Cf | Es | Fm | Md | No | Lr | Rf | Db | Sg | Bh | Hs | Mt | Ds | Rg | Cn | Nh | Fl | Mc | Lv | Ts | Og |\n |\n| |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Potassium | Calcium |  | Scandium | Titanium | Vanadium | Chromium | Manganese | Iron | Cobalt | Nickel | Copper | Zinc | Gallium | Germanium | Arsenic | Selenium | Bromine | Krypton |\n| Rubidium | Strontium |  |  | Yttrium | Zirconium | Niobium | Molybdenum | Technetium | Ruthenium | Rhodium | Palladium | Silver | Cadmium | Indium | Tin | Antimony | Tellurium | Iodine | Xenon |\n| Caesium | Barium | Lanthanum | Cerium | Praseodymium | Neodymium | Promethium | Samarium | Europium | Gadolinium | Terbium | Dysprosium | Holmium | Erbium | Thulium | Ytterbium | Lutetium | Hafnium | Tantalum | Tungsten | Rhenium | Osmium | Iridium | Platinum | Gold | Mercury (element) | Thallium | Lead | Bismuth | Polonium | Astatine | Radon |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Kondev, F.

They do so on the grounds of helium's 1s2 electron configuration, which is analogous to the ns2 valence configurations of the alkaline earth metals, and furthermore point to some specific trends that are more regular with helium than beryllium.[7][8][9][10][11] However, the classification of helium with the other noble gases remains near-universal, as its extraordinary inertness is extremely close to that of the other light noble gases neon and argon.[12]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAll heavier elements (including those necessary for rocky planets like the Earth, and for carbon-based or other life) have thus been created since the Big Bang in stars which were hot enough to fuse helium itself. All elements other than hydrogen and helium today account for only 2% of the mass of atomic matter in the universe. Helium-4, by contrast, makes up about 23% of the universe's ordinary matter—nearly all the ordinary matter that is not hydrogen.\n\n\n\n### Gas and plasma phases[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe first evidence of helium was observed on August 18, 1868, as a bright yellow line with a wavelength of 587.49 nanometers in the spectrum of the chromosphere of the Sun. The line was detected by French astronomer Jules Janssen during a total solar eclipse in Guntur, India.[25][26] This line was initially assumed to be sodium. On October 20 of the same year, English astronomer, Norman Lockyer, observed a yellow line in the solar spectrum, which, he named the D3 because it was near the known D1 and D2 Fraunhofer lines of sodium.[27][28] He concluded that it was caused by an element in the Sun unknown on Earth. Lockyer and English chemist Edward Frankland named the element with the Greek word for the Sun, ἥλιος (*helios*).[29][30]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTheoretically, other true compounds may be possible, such as helium fluorohydride (HHeF), which would be analogous to HArF, discovered in 2000.[118] Calculations show that two new compounds containing a helium-oxygen bond could be stable.[119] Two new molecular species, predicted using theory, CsFHeO and N(CH3)4FHeO, are derivatives of a metastable FHeO− anion first theorized in 2005 by a group from Taiwan. If confirmed by experiment, the only remaining element with no known stable compounds would be neon.[120]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Sir William Ramsay, the discoverer of terrestrial helium\n![](image)The cleveite sample from which Ramsay first purified helium[32]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n60. **^** Fowler, A.

JSTOR 3624645.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe unusual stability of the helium-4 nucleus is also important cosmologically: it explains the fact that in the first few minutes after the Big Bang, as the \"soup\" of free protons and neutrons which had initially been created in about 6:1 ratio cooled to the point that nuclear binding was possible, almost all first compound atomic nuclei to form were helium-4 nuclei. Owing to the relatively tight binding of helium-4 nuclei, its production consumed nearly all of the free neutrons in a few minutes, before they could beta-decay, and thus few neutrons were available to form heavier atoms such as lithium, beryllium, or boron. Helium-4 nuclear binding per nucleon is stronger than in any of these elements (see nucleogenesis and binding energy) and thus, once helium had been formed, no energetic drive was available to make elements 3, 4 and 5.[87] It is barely energetically favorable for helium to fuse into the next element with a lower energy per nucleon, carbon. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n69. **^** Emme, Eugene M. comp., ed.

It is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, inert, monatomic gas and the first in the noble gas group in the periodic table.[a] Its boiling point is the lowest among all the elements, and it does not have a melting point at standard pressure. It is the second-lightest and second most abundant element in the observable universe, after hydrogen. It is present at about 24% of the total elemental mass, which is more than 12 times the mass of all the heavier elements combined. Its abundance is similar to this in both the Sun and Jupiter, because of the very high nuclear binding energy (per nucleon) of helium-4, with respect to the next three elements after helium. This helium-4 binding energy also accounts for why it is a product of both nuclear fusion and radioactive decay. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n### Natural abundance[edit]\n\n\nAlthough it is rare on Earth, helium is the second most abundant element in the known Universe, constituting 23% of its baryonic mass. Only hydrogen is more abundant.[26] The vast majority of helium was formed by Big Bang nucleosynthesis one to three minutes after the Big Bang. As such, measurements of its abundance contribute to cosmological models. In stars, it is formed by the nuclear fusion of hydrogen in proton–proton chain reactions and the CNO cycle, part of stellar nucleosynthesis.[106]\n\n\nIn the Earth's atmosphere, the concentration of helium by volume is only 5.2 parts per million.[125][126] The concentration is low and fairly constant despite the continuous production of new helium because most helium in the Earth's atmosphere escapes into space by several processes.[127][128][129] In the Earth's heterosphere, a part of the upper atmosphere, helium and other lighter gases are the most abundant elements.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![Illuminated light red gas discharge tubes shaped as letters H and e](image)Helium discharge tube shaped into 'He', the element's symbol.\nHelium is the second least reactive noble gas after neon, and thus the second least reactive of all elements.[88] It is chemically inert and monatomic in all standard conditions. Because of helium's relatively low molar (atomic) mass, its thermal conductivity, specific heat, and sound speed in the gas phase are all greater than any other gas except hydrogen. For these reasons and the small size of helium monatomic molecules, helium diffuses through solids at a rate three times that of air and around 65% that of hydrogen.[28]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n71. **^** Williamson, John G.

Most terrestrial helium present today is created by the natural radioactive decay of heavy radioactive elements (thorium and uranium, although there are other examples), as the alpha particles emitted by such decays consist of helium-4 nuclei. This radiogenic helium is trapped with natural gas in concentrations as great as 7% by volume, from which it is extracted commercially by a low-temperature separation process called fractional distillation. Terrestrial helium is a non-renewable resource because once released into the atmosphere, it promptly escapes into space. Its supply is thought to be rapidly diminishing.[21][22] However, some studies suggest that helium produced deep in the Earth by radioactive decay can collect in natural gas reserves in larger-than-expected quantities,[23] in some cases having been released by volcanic activity.[24]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Scientific discoveries[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHowever, subsequently, in an unpublished letter of 19 December 1868 to Charles Sainte-Claire Deville, Janssen asked Deville to inform the French Academy of Sciences that : \"Several observers have claimed the bright D line as forming part of the spectrum of the prominences on 18 August.

In 1972, the same phenomenon was observed in helium-3, but at temperatures much closer to absolute zero, by American physicists Douglas D. Osheroff, David M. Lee, and Robert C. Richardson. The phenomenon in helium-3 is thought to be related to pairing of helium-3 fermions to make bosons, in analogy to Cooper pairs of electrons producing superconductivity.[63]\n\n\nIn 1961, Vignos and Fairbank reported the existence of a different phase of solid helium-4, designated the gamma-phase.

In the Earth's atmosphere, one atom is 3  \nHe for every million that are 4  \nHe.[26] Unlike most elements, helium's isotopic abundance varies greatly by origin, due to the different formation processes. The most common isotope, helium-4, is produced on Earth by alpha decay of heavier radioactive elements; the alpha particles that emerge are fully ionized helium-4 nuclei. Helium-4 is an unusually stable nucleus because its nucleons are arranged into complete shells. It was also formed in enormous quantities during Big Bang nucleosynthesis.[106]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n31. **^** Palmieri, Luigi (1881). \"La riga dell'Helium apparsa in una recente sublimazione vesuviana\" [The line of helium appeared in a recently sublimated material [from Mt.] Vesuvius.]. *Rendiconto dell'Accademia delle Scienze Fisiche e Matematiche (Naples, Italy)*. **20**: 223.

Some stable helium-3 (two protons and one neutron) is produced in fusion reactions from hydrogen, but it is a very small fraction compared to the highly favorable helium-4.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the perspective of quantum mechanics, helium is the second simplest atom to model, following the hydrogen atom. Helium is composed of two electrons in atomic orbitals surrounding a nucleus containing two protons and (usually) two neutrons. As in Newtonian mechanics, no system that consists of more than two particles can be solved with an exact analytical mathematical approach (see 3-body problem) and helium is no exception. Thus, numerical mathematical methods are required, even to solve the system of one nucleus and two electrons. Such computational chemistry methods have been used to create a quantum mechanical picture of helium electron binding which is accurate to within < 2% of the correct value, in a few computational steps.[86] Such models show that each electron in helium partly screens the nucleus from the other, so that the effective nuclear charge *Z*eff which each electron sees is about 1.69 units, not the 2 charges of a classic \"bare\" helium nucleus.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Phase diagram of helium-4.

The drop of liquid at the bottom of the glass represents helium spontaneously escaping from the container over the side, to empty out of the container. The energy to drive this process is supplied by the potential energy of the falling helium.\nHelium liquifies when cooled below 4.2 K at atmospheric pressure. Unlike any other element, however, helium remains liquid down to a temperature of absolute zero. This is a direct effect of quantum mechanics: specifically, the zero point energy of the system is too high to allow freezing. Pressures above about 25 atmospheres are required to freeze it. There are two liquid phases: Helium I is a conventional liquid, and Helium II, which occurs at a lower temperature, is a superfluid. \n\n\n\n#### Helium I[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Structure of the helium hydride ion, HHe+\n![](image)Structure of the suspected fluoroheliate anion, OHeF−\nHelium has a valence of zero and is chemically unreactive under all normal conditions.[101] It is an electrical insulator unless ionized. As with the other noble gases, helium has metastable energy levels that allow it to remain ionized in an electrical discharge with a voltage below its ionization potential.[28] Helium can form unstable compounds, known as excimers, with tungsten, iodine, fluorine, sulfur, and phosphorus when it is subjected to a glow discharge, to electron bombardment, or reduced to plasma by other means.

There was thus no time for significant carbon to be formed in the few minutes after the Big Bang, before the early expanding universe cooled to the temperature and pressure point where helium fusion to carbon was no longer possible. This left the early universe with a very similar ratio of hydrogen/helium as is observed today (3 parts hydrogen to 1 part helium-4 by mass), with nearly all the neutrons in the universe trapped in helium-4.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* Janssen (1868) \"Indication de quelques-uns des résultats obtenus à Cocanada, pendant l'éclipse du mois d'août dernier, et à la suite de cette éclipse\" (Information on some of the results obtained at Cocanada, during the eclipse of the month of last August, and following that eclipse), *Comptes rendus* ... , **67** : 838–839.\n\t* Wheeler M.

High-energy electron-scattering experiments show its charge to decrease exponentially from a maximum at a central point, exactly as does the charge density of helium's own electron cloud. This symmetry reflects similar underlying physics: the pair of neutrons and the pair of protons in helium's nucleus obey the same quantum mechanical rules as do helium's pair of electrons (although the nuclear particles are subject to a different nuclear binding potential), so that all these fermions fully occupy 1s orbitals in pairs, none of them possessing orbital angular momentum, and each cancelling the other's intrinsic spin. Adding another of any of these particles would require angular momentum and would release substantially less energy (in fact, no nucleus with five nucleons is stable). This arrangement is thus energetically extremely stable for all these particles, and this stability accounts for many crucial facts regarding helium in nature.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n have been created this way.[116] HeH+ is also stable in its ground state, but is extremely reactive—it is the strongest Brønsted acid known, and therefore can exist only in isolation, as it will protonate any molecule or counteranion it contacts. This technique has also produced the neutral molecule He2, which has a large number of band systems, and HgHe, which is apparently held together only by polarization forces.[28]\n\n\nVan der Waals compounds of helium can also be formed with cryogenic helium gas and atoms of some other substance, such as LiHe and He2.[117]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n77. **^** \"Helium End User Statistic\" (PDF).

Helium is found in large amounts in minerals of uranium and thorium, including uraninite and its varieties cleveite and pitchblende,[18][130] carnotite and monazite (a group name; \"monazite\" usually refers to monazite-(Ce)),[131][132] because they emit alpha particles (helium nuclei, He2+) to which electrons immediately combine as soon as the particle is stopped by the rock. In this way an estimated 3000 metric tons of helium are generated per year throughout the lithosphere.[133][134][135] In the Earth's crust, the concentration of helium is 8 parts per billion. In seawater, the concentration is only 4 parts per trillion. There are also small amounts in mineral springs, volcanic gas, and meteoric iron. Because helium is trapped in the subsurface under conditions that also trap natural gas, the greatest natural concentrations of helium on the planet are found in natural gas, from which most commercial helium is extracted. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. **^** Lieutenant John Herschel (1868) \"Account of the solar eclipse of 1868, as seen at Jamkandi in the Bombay Presidency,\" *Proceedings of the Royal Society of London*, **17** : 104–120.

Similar cooling of helium-3, which has a lower boiling point, can achieve about 0.2 kelvin in a helium-3 refrigerator. Equal mixtures of liquid 3  \nHe and 4  \nHe below 0.8 K separate into two immiscible phases due to their dissimilarity (they follow different quantum statistics: helium-4 atoms are bosons while helium-3 atoms are fermions).[28] Dilution refrigerators use this immiscibility to achieve temperatures of a few millikelvins.[113]\n\n\nIt is possible to produce exotic helium isotopes, which rapidly decay into other substances. The shortest-lived heavy helium isotope is the unbound helium-10 with a half-life of 2.6(4)×10−22 s.[6] Helium-6 decays by emitting a beta particle and has a half-life of 0.8 second. Helium-7 and helium-8 are created in certain nuclear reactions.[28] Helium-6 and helium-8 are known to exhibit a nuclear halo.[28]\n\n\n\n### Properties[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Historical marker, denoting a massive helium find near Dexter, Kansas\nAfter an oil drilling operation in 1903 in Dexter, Kansas produced a gas geyser that would not burn, Kansas state geologist Erasmus Haworth collected samples of the escaping gas and took them back to the University of Kansas at Lawrence where, with the help of chemists Hamilton Cady and David McFarland, he discovered that the gas consisted of, by volume, 72% nitrogen, 15% methane (a combustible percentage only with sufficient oxygen), 1% hydrogen, and 12% an unidentifiable gas.[26][65] With further analysis, Cady and McFarland discovered that 1.84% of the gas sample was helium.[66][67] This showed that despite its overall rarity on Earth, helium was concentrated in large quantities under the American Great Plains, available for extraction as a byproduct of natural gas.[68]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n#### Related stability of the helium-4 nucleus and electron shell[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2013, Qatar started up the world's largest helium unit,[82] although the 2017 Qatar diplomatic crisis severely affected helium production there.[83] 2014 was widely acknowledged to be a year of over-supply in the helium business, following years of renowned shortages.[84] Nasdaq reported (2015) that for Air Products, an international corporation that sells gases for industrial use, helium volumes remain under economic pressure due to feedstock supply constraints.[85]\n\n\n\n## Characteristics[edit]\n\n\n### Atom[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Helium atom\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

The endohedral fullerene molecules formed are stable at high temperatures. When chemical derivatives of these fullerenes are formed, the helium stays inside.[121] If helium-3 is used, it can be readily observed by helium nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.[122] Many fullerenes containing helium-3 have been reported. Although the helium atoms are not attached by covalent or ionic bonds, these substances have distinct properties and a definite composition, like all stoichiometric chemical compounds.\n\n\nUnder high pressures helium can form compounds with various other elements. Helium-nitrogen clathrate (He(N2)11) crystals have been grown at room temperature at pressures ca. 10 GPa in a diamond anvil cell.[123] The insulating electride Na2He has been shown to be thermodynamically stable at pressures above 113 GPa.

It is a soft, silvery-white alkali metal. Under standard conditions, it is the least dense metal and the least dense solid element. Like all alkali metals, lithium is highly reactive and flammable, and must be stored in vacuum, inert atmosphere, or inert liquid such as purified kerosene or mineral oil. It exhibits a metallic luster. It corrodes quickly in air to a dull silvery gray, then black tarnish. It does not occur freely in nature, but occurs mainly as pegmatitic minerals, which were once the main source of lithium. Due to its solubility as an ion, it is present in ocean water and is commonly obtained from brines. Lithium metal is isolated electrolytically from a mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to modern cosmological theory, lithium—in both stable isotopes (lithium-6 and lithium-7)—was one of the three elements synthesized in the Big Bang.[35] Though the amount of lithium generated in Big Bang nucleosynthesis is dependent upon the number of photons per baryon, for accepted values the lithium abundance can be calculated, and there is a \"cosmological lithium discrepancy\" in the universe: older stars seem to have less lithium than they should, and some younger stars have much more.[36] The lack of lithium in older stars is apparently caused by the \"mixing\" of lithium into the interior of stars, where it is destroyed,[37] while lithium is produced in younger stars. Although it transmutes into two atoms of helium due to collision with a proton at temperatures above 2.4 million degrees Celsius (most stars easily attain this temperature in their interiors), lithium is more abundant than computations would predict in later-generation stars.[38]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Atomic number (*Z*) | 3 |\n| Group | group 1: hydrogen and alkali metals |\n| Period | period 2 |\n| Block |   s-block |\n| Electron configuration | [He] 2s1 |\n| Electrons per shell | 2, 1 |\n| Physical properties |\n| Phase at STP | solid |\n| Melting point | 453.65 K ​(180.50 °C, ​356.90 °F)  |\n| Boiling point | 1603 K ​(1330 °C, ​2426 °F)  |\n| Density (at 20° C) | 0.5334 g/cm3[3] |\n| when liquid (at m.p.) | 0.512 g/cm3 |\n| Critical point | 3220 K, 67 MPa *(extrapolated)* |\n| Heat of fusion | 3.00 kJ/mol |\n| Heat of vaporization | 136 kJ/mol  |\n| Molar heat capacity | 24.860 J/(mol·K)  |\n| **Vapor pressure**| *P* (Pa) | 1\n | 10\n | 100\n | 1 k\n | 10 k\n | 100 k\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| at *T* (K) | 797\n | 885\n | 995\n | 1144\n | 1337\n | 1610\n |\n |\n| Atomic properties |\n| Oxidation states | 0[4], **+1** (a strongly basic oxide) |\n| Electronegativity | Pauling scale: 0.98  |\n| Ionization energies | * 1st: 520.2 kJ/mol\n* 2nd: 7298.1 kJ/mol\n* 3rd: 11815.0 kJ/mol\n*\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNaturally occurring lithium is composed of two stable isotopes, 6Li and 7Li, the latter being the more abundant (95.15% natural abundance).[22][23] Both natural isotopes have anomalously low nuclear binding energy per nucleon (compared to the neighboring elements on the periodic table, helium and beryllium); lithium is the only low numbered element that can produce net energy through nuclear fission. The two lithium nuclei have lower binding energies per nucleon than any other stable nuclides other than hydrogen-1, deuterium and helium-3.[24] As a result of this, though very light in atomic weight, lithium is less common in the Solar System than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements.[7] Seven radioisotopes have been characterized, the most stable being 8Li with a half-life of 838 ms and 9Li with a half-life of 178 ms. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are shorter than 8.6 ms. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n162. **^** Haupin, W.

Like the other alkali metals (which are sodium (Na), potassium (K), rubidium (Rb), caesium (Cs), and francium (Fr)), lithium has a single valence electron that, in the presence of solvents, is easily released to form Li+.[9] Because of this, lithium is a good conductor of heat and electricity as well as a highly reactive element, though it is the least reactive of the alkali metals. Lithium's low reactivity is due to the proximity of its valence electron to its nucleus (the remaining two electrons are in the 1s orbital, much lower in energy, and do not participate in chemical bonds).[9] Molten lithium is significantly more reactive than its solid form.[10][11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6Li + n → 4He + 3H.\nLithium is also used as a source for alpha particles, or helium nuclei. When 7Li is bombarded by accelerated protons 8Be is formed, which almost immediately undergoes fission to form two alpha particles. This feat, called \"splitting the atom\" at the time, was the first fully human-made nuclear reaction. It was produced by Cockroft and Walton in 1932.[188][189] Injection of lithium powders is used in fusion reactors to manipulate plasma-material interactions and dissipate energy in the hot thermo-nuclear fusion plasma boundary.[190][191]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nlarger quantities of lithium were produced through the electrolysis of lithium chloride by Robert Bunsen and Augustus Matthiessen.[72][86] The discovery of this procedure led to commercial production of lithium in 1923 by the German company Metallgesellschaft AG, which performed an electrolysis of a liquid mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.[72][87][88]\n\n\nAustralian psychiatrist John Cade is credited with reintroducing and popularizing the use of lithium to treat mania in 1949.[89] Shortly after, throughout the mid 20th century, lithium's mood stabilizing applicability for mania and depression took off in Europe and the United States.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n199. **^** Furr, A.

Because lithium is present in cooler, less-massive brown dwarfs, but is destroyed in hotter red dwarf stars, its presence in the stars' spectra can be used in the \"lithium test\" to differentiate the two, as both are smaller than the Sun.[38][40][41] Certain orange stars can also contain a high concentration of lithium. Those orange stars found to have a higher than usual concentration of lithium (such as Centaurus X-4) orbit massive objects—neutron stars or black holes—whose gravity evidently pulls heavier lithium to the surface of a hydrogen-helium star, causing more lithium to be observed.[38]\n\n\nOn 27 May 2020, astronomers reported that classical nova explosions are galactic producers of lithium-7.[42][43]\n\n\n\n### Terrestrial[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Lithium compounds and Lithium minerals\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Hydrogen |  | Helium |\n| Lithium | Beryllium |  | Boron | Carbon | Nitrogen | Oxygen | Fluorine | Neon |\n| Sodium | Magnesium |  | Aluminium | Silicon | Phosphorus | Sulfur | Chlorine | Argon |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNuclear weapons manufacture and other nuclear physics applications are a major source of artificial lithium fractionation, with the light isotope 6Li being retained by industry and military stockpiles to such an extent that it has caused slight but measurable change in the 6Li to 7Li ratios in natural sources, such as rivers.

Because of its relative nuclear instability, lithium is less common in the solar system than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements even though its nuclei are very light: it is an exception to the trend that heavier nuclei are less common.[7] For related reasons, lithium has important uses in nuclear physics. The transmutation of lithium atoms to helium in 1932 was the first fully human-made nuclear reaction, and lithium deuteride serves as a fusion fuel in staged thermonuclear weapons.[8]\n\n\nLithium and its compounds have several industrial applications, including heat-resistant glass and ceramics, lithium grease lubricants, flux additives for iron, steel and aluminium production, lithium metal batteries, and lithium-ion batteries.

Natural lithium contains about 7.5% lithium-6 from which large amounts of lithium-6 have been produced by isotope separation for use in nuclear weapons.[184] Lithium-7 gained interest for use in nuclear reactor coolants.[185]\n\n\n\n![](image)Lithium deuteride was used as fuel in the Castle Bravo nuclear device.\nLithium deuteride was the fusion fuel of choice in early versions of the hydrogen bomb. When bombarded by neutrons, both 6Li and 7Li produce tritium — this reaction, which was not fully understood when hydrogen bombs were first tested, was responsible for the runaway yield of the Castle Bravo nuclear test. Tritium fuses with deuterium in a fusion reaction that is relatively easy to achieve. Although details remain secret, lithium-6 deuteride apparently still plays a role in modern nuclear weapons as a fusion material.[186]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Scatter plots of lithium grade and tonnage for selected world deposits, as of 2017\nThe US Geological Survey (USGS) estimated worldwide identified lithium reserves in 2020 and 2021 to be 17 million and 21 million tonnes, respectively.[55][54] An accurate estimate of world lithium reserves is difficult.[107][108] One reason for this is that most lithium classification schemes are developed for solid ore deposits, whereas brine is a fluid that is problematic to treat with the same classification scheme due to varying concentrations and pumping effects.[109]\n\n\nIn 2019, world production of lithium from spodumene was around 80,000t per annum, primarily from the Greenbushes pegmatite and from some Chinese and Chilean sources. The Talison mine in Greenbushes is reported to be the largest and to have the highest grade of ore at 2.4% Li2O (2012 figures).[110]\n\n\n\n#### Lithium triangle and other brine sources[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 16 July 2018 2.5 million tonnes of high-grade lithium resources and 124 million pounds of uranium resources were found in the Falchani hard rock deposit in the region Puno, Peru.[117]\nIn 2020, Australia granted Major Project Status (MPS) to the Finniss Lithium Project for a strategically important lithium deposit: an estimated 3.45 million tonnes (Mt) of mineral resource at 1.4 percent lithium oxide.[118][119] Operational mining began in 2022.[120]\n\n\nA deposit discovered in 2013 in Wyoming's Rock Springs Uplift is estimated to contain 228,000 tons.[*clarification needed*] Additional deposits in the same formation were estimated to be as much as 18 million tons.[121] Similarly in Nevada, the McDermitt Caldera hosts lithium-bearing volcanic muds that consist of the largest known deposits of lithium within the United States.[122]\n\n\nThe Pampean Pegmatite Province in Argentina is known to have a total of at least 200,000 tons of spodumene with lithium oxide (Li2O) grades varying between 5 and 8 wt.%.[123]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLithium has been found effective in assisting the perfection of silicon nano-welds in electronic components for electric batteries and other devices.[166]\n\n\n\n![](image)Lithium use in flares and pyrotechnics is due to its rose-red flame.[167]\n### Pyrotechnics[edit]\n\n\nLithium compounds are used as pyrotechnic colorants and oxidizers in red fireworks and flares.[20][168]\n\n\n\n### Air purification[edit]\n\n\nLithium chloride and lithium bromide are hygroscopic and are used as desiccants for gas streams.[20] Lithium hydroxide and lithium peroxide are the salts most used in confined areas, such as aboard spacecraft and submarines, for carbon dioxide removal and air purification. Lithium hydroxide absorbs carbon dioxide from the air by forming lithium carbonate, and is preferred over other alkaline hydroxides for its low weight.\n\n\nLithium peroxide (Li2O2) in presence of moisture not only reacts with carbon dioxide to form lithium carbonate, but also releases oxygen.[169][170] The reaction is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAlthough lithium is widely distributed on Earth, it does not naturally occur in elemental form due to its high reactivity.[9] The total lithium content of seawater is very large and is estimated as 230 billion tonnes, where the element exists at a relatively constant concentration of 0.14 to 0.25 parts per million (ppm),[44][45] or 25 micromolar;[46] higher concentrations approaching 7 ppm are found near hydrothermal vents.[45]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n2 Li2O2 + 2 CO2 → 2 Li2CO3 + O2.\nSome of the aforementioned compounds, as well as lithium perchlorate, are used in oxygen candles that supply submarines with oxygen. These can also include small amounts of boron, magnesium, aluminium, silicon, titanium, manganese, and iron.[171]\n\n\n\n### Optics[edit]\n\n\nLithium fluoride, artificially grown as crystal, is clear and transparent and often used in specialist optics for IR, UV and VUV (vacuum UV) applications. It has one of the lowest refractive indexes and the furthest transmission range in the deep UV of most common materials.[172] Finely divided lithium fluoride powder has been used for thermoluminescent radiation dosimetry (TLD): when a sample of such is exposed to radiation, it accumulates crystal defects which, when heated, resolve via a release of bluish light whose intensity is proportional to the absorbed dose, thus allowing this to be quantified.[173] Lithium fluoride is sometimes used in focal lenses of telescopes.[20][174]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n182. **^** Hughes, T.G.; Smith, R.B. & Kiely, D.H.

However, it is important to note that in the absence of coordinating solvents or ligands, organolithium compounds form dimeric, tetrameric, and hexameric clusters (e.g., BuLi is actually [BuLi]6 and MeLi is actually [MeLi]4) which feature multi-center bonding and increase the coordination number around lithium. These clusters are broken down into smaller or monomeric units in the presence of solvents like dimethoxyethane (DME) or ligands like tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA).[102] As an exception to the duet rule, a two-coordinate lithate complex with four electrons around lithium, [Li(thf)4]+[((Me3Si)3C)2Li]–, has been characterized crystallographically.[103]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of countries by lithium production\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOrganolithium compounds are numerous and useful. They are defined by the presence of a bond between carbon and lithium. They serve as metal-stabilized carbanions, although their solution and solid-state structures are more complex than this simplistic view.[101] Thus, these are extremely powerful bases and nucleophiles. They have also been applied in asymmetric synthesis in the pharmaceutical industry. For laboratory organic synthesis, many organolithium reagents are commercially available in solution form. These reagents are highly reactive, and are sometimes pyrophoric.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe demand for lithium increased dramatically during the Cold War with the production of nuclear fusion weapons. Both lithium-6 and lithium-7 produce tritium when irradiated by neutrons, and are thus useful for the production of tritium by itself, as well as a form of solid fusion fuel used inside hydrogen bombs in the form of lithium deuteride. The US became the prime producer of lithium between the late 1950s and the mid-1980s. At the end, the stockpile of lithium was roughly 42,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide. The stockpiled lithium was depleted in lithium-6 by 75%, which was enough to affect the measured atomic weight of lithium in many standardized chemicals, and even the atomic weight of lithium in some \"natural sources\" of lithium ion which had been \"contaminated\" by lithium salts discharged from isotope separation facilities, which had found its way into ground water.[32][90]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLithium isotopes fractionate substantially during a wide variety of natural processes,[30] including mineral formation (chemical precipitation), metabolism, and ion exchange. Lithium ions substitute for magnesium and iron in octahedral sites in clay minerals, where 6Li is preferred to 7Li, resulting in enrichment of the light isotope in processes of hyperfiltration and rock alteration. The exotic 11Li is known to exhibit a neutron halo, with 2 neutrons orbiting around its nucleus of 3 protons and 6 neutrons. The process known as laser isotope separation can be used to separate lithium isotopes, in particular 7Li from 6Li.[31]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n158. **^** Rand, Salvatore J.

It is a soft, silvery-white alkali metal. Under standard conditions, it is the least dense metal and the least dense solid element. Like all alkali metals, lithium is highly reactive and flammable, and must be stored in vacuum, inert atmosphere, or inert liquid such as purified kerosene or mineral oil. It exhibits a metallic luster. It corrodes quickly in air to a dull silvery gray, then black tarnish. It does not occur freely in nature, but occurs mainly as pegmatitic minerals, which were once the main source of lithium. Due to its solubility as an ion, it is present in ocean water and is commonly obtained from brines. Lithium metal is isolated electrolytically from a mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to modern cosmological theory, lithium—in both stable isotopes (lithium-6 and lithium-7)—was one of the three elements synthesized in the Big Bang.[35] Though the amount of lithium generated in Big Bang nucleosynthesis is dependent upon the number of photons per baryon, for accepted values the lithium abundance can be calculated, and there is a \"cosmological lithium discrepancy\" in the universe: older stars seem to have less lithium than they should, and some younger stars have much more.[36] The lack of lithium in older stars is apparently caused by the \"mixing\" of lithium into the interior of stars, where it is destroyed,[37] while lithium is produced in younger stars. Although it transmutes into two atoms of helium due to collision with a proton at temperatures above 2.4 million degrees Celsius (most stars easily attain this temperature in their interiors), lithium is more abundant than computations would predict in later-generation stars.[38]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Atomic number (*Z*) | 3 |\n| Group | group 1: hydrogen and alkali metals |\n| Period | period 2 |\n| Block |   s-block |\n| Electron configuration | [He] 2s1 |\n| Electrons per shell | 2, 1 |\n| Physical properties |\n| Phase at STP | solid |\n| Melting point | 453.65 K ​(180.50 °C, ​356.90 °F)  |\n| Boiling point | 1603 K ​(1330 °C, ​2426 °F)  |\n| Density (at 20° C) | 0.5334 g/cm3[3] |\n| when liquid (at m.p.) | 0.512 g/cm3 |\n| Critical point | 3220 K, 67 MPa *(extrapolated)* |\n| Heat of fusion | 3.00 kJ/mol |\n| Heat of vaporization | 136 kJ/mol  |\n| Molar heat capacity | 24.860 J/(mol·K)  |\n| **Vapor pressure**| *P* (Pa) | 1\n | 10\n | 100\n | 1 k\n | 10 k\n | 100 k\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| at *T* (K) | 797\n | 885\n | 995\n | 1144\n | 1337\n | 1610\n |\n |\n| Atomic properties |\n| Oxidation states | 0[4], **+1** (a strongly basic oxide) |\n| Electronegativity | Pauling scale: 0.98  |\n| Ionization energies | * 1st: 520.2 kJ/mol\n* 2nd: 7298.1 kJ/mol\n* 3rd: 11815.0 kJ/mol\n*\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNaturally occurring lithium is composed of two stable isotopes, 6Li and 7Li, the latter being the more abundant (95.15% natural abundance).[22][23] Both natural isotopes have anomalously low nuclear binding energy per nucleon (compared to the neighboring elements on the periodic table, helium and beryllium); lithium is the only low numbered element that can produce net energy through nuclear fission. The two lithium nuclei have lower binding energies per nucleon than any other stable nuclides other than hydrogen-1, deuterium and helium-3.[24] As a result of this, though very light in atomic weight, lithium is less common in the Solar System than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements.[7] Seven radioisotopes have been characterized, the most stable being 8Li with a half-life of 838 ms and 9Li with a half-life of 178 ms.

Like the other alkali metals (which are sodium (Na), potassium (K), rubidium (Rb), caesium (Cs), and francium (Fr)), lithium has a single valence electron that, in the presence of solvents, is easily released to form Li+.[9] Because of this, lithium is a good conductor of heat and electricity as well as a highly reactive element, though it is the least reactive of the alkali metals. Lithium's low reactivity is due to the proximity of its valence electron to its nucleus (the remaining two electrons are in the 1s orbital, much lower in energy, and do not participate in chemical bonds).[9] Molten lithium is significantly more reactive than its solid form.[10][11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6Li + n → 4He + 3H.\nLithium is also used as a source for alpha particles, or helium nuclei. When 7Li is bombarded by accelerated protons 8Be is formed, which almost immediately undergoes fission to form two alpha particles. This feat, called \"splitting the atom\" at the time, was the first fully human-made nuclear reaction. It was produced by Cockroft and Walton in 1932.[188][189] Injection of lithium powders is used in fusion reactors to manipulate plasma-material interactions and dissipate energy in the hot thermo-nuclear fusion plasma boundary.[190][191]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nlarger quantities of lithium were produced through the electrolysis of lithium chloride by Robert Bunsen and Augustus Matthiessen.[72][86] The discovery of this procedure led to commercial production of lithium in 1923 by the German company Metallgesellschaft AG, which performed an electrolysis of a liquid mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.[72][87][88]\n\n\nAustralian psychiatrist John Cade is credited with reintroducing and popularizing the use of lithium to treat mania in 1949.[89] Shortly after, throughout the mid 20th century, lithium's mood stabilizing applicability for mania and depression took off in Europe and the United States.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n199. **^** Furr, A.

Because lithium is present in cooler, less-massive brown dwarfs, but is destroyed in hotter red dwarf stars, its presence in the stars' spectra can be used in the \"lithium test\" to differentiate the two, as both are smaller than the Sun.[38][40][41] Certain orange stars can also contain a high concentration of lithium. Those orange stars found to have a higher than usual concentration of lithium (such as Centaurus X-4) orbit massive objects—neutron stars or black holes—whose gravity evidently pulls heavier lithium to the surface of a hydrogen-helium star, causing more lithium to be observed.[38]\n\n\nOn 27 May 2020, astronomers reported that classical nova explosions are galactic producers of lithium-7.[42][43]\n\n\n\n### Terrestrial[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Lithium compounds and Lithium minerals\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Hydrogen |  | Helium |\n| Lithium | Beryllium |  | Boron | Carbon | Nitrogen | Oxygen | Fluorine | Neon |\n| Sodium | Magnesium |  | Aluminium | Silicon | Phosphorus | Sulfur | Chlorine | Argon |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNuclear weapons manufacture and other nuclear physics applications are a major source of artificial lithium fractionation, with the light isotope 6Li being retained by industry and military stockpiles to such an extent that it has caused slight but measurable change in the 6Li to 7Li ratios in natural sources, such as rivers.

Because of its relative nuclear instability, lithium is less common in the solar system than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements even though its nuclei are very light: it is an exception to the trend that heavier nuclei are less common.[7] For related reasons, lithium has important uses in nuclear physics. The transmutation of lithium atoms to helium in 1932 was the first fully human-made nuclear reaction, and lithium deuteride serves as a fusion fuel in staged thermonuclear weapons.[8]\n\n\nLithium and its compounds have several industrial applications, including heat-resistant glass and ceramics, lithium grease lubricants, flux additives for iron, steel and aluminium production, lithium metal batteries, and lithium-ion batteries.

At 4.2 K it has a rhombohedral crystal system (with a nine-layer repeat spacing); at higher temperatures it transforms to face-centered cubic and then body-centered cubic. At liquid-helium temperatures (4 K) the rhombohedral structure is prevalent.[18] Multiple allotropic forms have been identified for lithium at high pressures.[19]\n\n\nLithium has a mass specific heat capacity of 3.58 kilojoules per kilogram-kelvin, the highest of all solids.[20][21] Because of this, lithium metal is often used in coolants for heat transfer applications.[20]\n\n\n\n### Isotopes[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Isotopes of lithium\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to the *Handbook of Lithium and Natural Calcium*, \"Lithium is a comparatively rare element, although it is found in many rocks and some brines, but always in very low concentrations.

Natural lithium contains about 7.5% lithium-6 from which large amounts of lithium-6 have been produced by isotope separation for use in nuclear weapons.[184] Lithium-7 gained interest for use in nuclear reactor coolants.[185]\n\n\n\n![](image)Lithium deuteride was used as fuel in the Castle Bravo nuclear device.\nLithium deuteride was the fusion fuel of choice in early versions of the hydrogen bomb. When bombarded by neutrons, both 6Li and 7Li produce tritium — this reaction, which was not fully understood when hydrogen bombs were first tested, was responsible for the runaway yield of the Castle Bravo nuclear test. Tritium fuses with deuterium in a fusion reaction that is relatively easy to achieve. Although details remain secret, lithium-6 deuteride apparently still plays a role in modern nuclear weapons as a fusion material.[186]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Scatter plots of lithium grade and tonnage for selected world deposits, as of 2017\nThe US Geological Survey (USGS) estimated worldwide identified lithium reserves in 2020 and 2021 to be 17 million and 21 million tonnes, respectively.[55][54] An accurate estimate of world lithium reserves is difficult.[107][108] One reason for this is that most lithium classification schemes are developed for solid ore deposits, whereas brine is a fluid that is problematic to treat with the same classification scheme due to varying concentrations and pumping effects.[109]\n\n\nIn 2019, world production of lithium from spodumene was around 80,000t per annum, primarily from the Greenbushes pegmatite and from some Chinese and Chilean sources. The Talison mine in Greenbushes is reported to be the largest and to have the highest grade of ore at 2.4% Li2O (2012 figures).[110]\n\n\n\n#### Lithium triangle and other brine sources[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 16 July 2018 2.5 million tonnes of high-grade lithium resources and 124 million pounds of uranium resources were found in the Falchani hard rock deposit in the region Puno, Peru.[117]\nIn 2020, Australia granted Major Project Status (MPS) to the Finniss Lithium Project for a strategically important lithium deposit: an estimated 3.45 million tonnes (Mt) of mineral resource at 1.4 percent lithium oxide.[118][119] Operational mining began in 2022.[120]\n\n\nA deposit discovered in 2013 in Wyoming's Rock Springs Uplift is estimated to contain 228,000 tons.[*clarification needed*] Additional deposits in the same formation were estimated to be as much as 18 million tons.[121] Similarly in Nevada, the McDermitt Caldera hosts lithium-bearing volcanic muds that consist of the largest known deposits of lithium within the United States.[122]\n\n\nThe Pampean Pegmatite Province in Argentina is known to have a total of at least 200,000 tons of spodumene with lithium oxide (Li2O) grades varying between 5 and 8 wt.%.[123]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLithium has been found effective in assisting the perfection of silicon nano-welds in electronic components for electric batteries and other devices.[166]\n\n\n\n![](image)Lithium use in flares and pyrotechnics is due to its rose-red flame.[167]\n### Pyrotechnics[edit]\n\n\nLithium compounds are used as pyrotechnic colorants and oxidizers in red fireworks and flares.[20][168]\n\n\n\n### Air purification[edit]\n\n\nLithium chloride and lithium bromide are hygroscopic and are used as desiccants for gas streams.[20] Lithium hydroxide and lithium peroxide are the salts most used in confined areas, such as aboard spacecraft and submarines, for carbon dioxide removal and air purification. Lithium hydroxide absorbs carbon dioxide from the air by forming lithium carbonate, and is preferred over other alkaline hydroxides for its low weight.\n\n\nLithium peroxide (Li2O2) in presence of moisture not only reacts with carbon dioxide to form lithium carbonate, but also releases oxygen.[169][170] The reaction is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAlthough lithium is widely distributed on Earth, it does not naturally occur in elemental form due to its high reactivity.[9] The total lithium content of seawater is very large and is estimated as 230 billion tonnes, where the element exists at a relatively constant concentration of 0.14 to 0.25 parts per million (ppm),[44][45] or 25 micromolar;[46] higher concentrations approaching 7 ppm are found near hydrothermal vents.[45]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n2 Li2O2 + 2 CO2 → 2 Li2CO3 + O2.\nSome of the aforementioned compounds, as well as lithium perchlorate, are used in oxygen candles that supply submarines with oxygen. These can also include small amounts of boron, magnesium, aluminium, silicon, titanium, manganese, and iron.[171]\n\n\n\n### Optics[edit]\n\n\nLithium fluoride, artificially grown as crystal, is clear and transparent and often used in specialist optics for IR, UV and VUV (vacuum UV) applications. It has one of the lowest refractive indexes and the furthest transmission range in the deep UV of most common materials.[172] Finely divided lithium fluoride powder has been used for thermoluminescent radiation dosimetry (TLD): when a sample of such is exposed to radiation, it accumulates crystal defects which, when heated, resolve via a release of bluish light whose intensity is proportional to the absorbed dose, thus allowing this to be quantified.[173] Lithium fluoride is sometimes used in focal lenses of telescopes.[20][174]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n182. **^** Hughes, T.G.; Smith, R.B. & Kiely, D.H.

However, it is important to note that in the absence of coordinating solvents or ligands, organolithium compounds form dimeric, tetrameric, and hexameric clusters (e.g., BuLi is actually [BuLi]6 and MeLi is actually [MeLi]4) which feature multi-center bonding and increase the coordination number around lithium. These clusters are broken down into smaller or monomeric units in the presence of solvents like dimethoxyethane (DME) or ligands like tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA).[102] As an exception to the duet rule, a two-coordinate lithate complex with four electrons around lithium, [Li(thf)4]+[((Me3Si)3C)2Li]–, has been characterized crystallographically.[103]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of countries by lithium production\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOrganolithium compounds are numerous and useful. They are defined by the presence of a bond between carbon and lithium. They serve as metal-stabilized carbanions, although their solution and solid-state structures are more complex than this simplistic view.[101] Thus, these are extremely powerful bases and nucleophiles. They have also been applied in asymmetric synthesis in the pharmaceutical industry. For laboratory organic synthesis, many organolithium reagents are commercially available in solution form. These reagents are highly reactive, and are sometimes pyrophoric.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe demand for lithium increased dramatically during the Cold War with the production of nuclear fusion weapons. Both lithium-6 and lithium-7 produce tritium when irradiated by neutrons, and are thus useful for the production of tritium by itself, as well as a form of solid fusion fuel used inside hydrogen bombs in the form of lithium deuteride. The US became the prime producer of lithium between the late 1950s and the mid-1980s. At the end, the stockpile of lithium was roughly 42,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide. The stockpiled lithium was depleted in lithium-6 by 75%, which was enough to affect the measured atomic weight of lithium in many standardized chemicals, and even the atomic weight of lithium in some \"natural sources\" of lithium ion which had been \"contaminated\" by lithium salts discharged from isotope separation facilities, which had found its way into ground water.[32][90]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLithium isotopes fractionate substantially during a wide variety of natural processes,[30] including mineral formation (chemical precipitation), metabolism, and ion exchange. Lithium ions substitute for magnesium and iron in octahedral sites in clay minerals, where 6Li is preferred to 7Li, resulting in enrichment of the light isotope in processes of hyperfiltration and rock alteration. The exotic 11Li is known to exhibit a neutron halo, with 2 neutrons orbiting around its nucleus of 3 protons and 6 neutrons. The process known as laser isotope separation can be used to separate lithium isotopes, in particular 7Li from 6Li.[31]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n158. **^** Rand, Salvatore J.

The original industrial involvement included subsidiaries and scientists related to the Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation in Cleveland, Ohio, and Siemens & Halske AG in Berlin. In the US, the process was ruled by Hugh S. Cooper, director of The Kemet Laboratories Company. In Germany, the first commercially successful process for producing beryllium was developed in 1921 by Alfred Stock and Hans Goldschmidt.[70]\n\n\nA sample of beryllium was bombarded with alpha rays from the decay of radium in a 1932 experiment by James Chadwick that uncovered the existence of the neutron.[32] This same method is used in one class of radioisotope-based laboratory neutron sources that produce 30 neutrons for every million α particles.[25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n14. **^** \"About Beryllium\".

It is a steel-gray, strong, lightweight and brittle alkaline earth metal. It is a divalent element that occurs naturally only in combination with other elements to form minerals. Gemstones high in beryllium include beryl (aquamarine, emerald, red beryl) and chrysoberyl. It is a relatively rare element in the universe, usually occurring as a product of the spallation of larger atomic nuclei that have collided with cosmic rays. Within the cores of stars, beryllium is depleted as it is fused into heavier elements. Beryllium constitutes about 0.0004 percent by mass of Earth's crust. The world's annual beryllium production of 220 tons is usually manufactured by extraction from the mineral beryl, a difficult process because beryllium bonds strongly to oxygen.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n121. **^** \"Photograph of Chicago Pile One Scientists 1946\".

Most early fluorescent lamps used zinc orthosilicate with varying content of beryllium to emit greenish light. Small additions of magnesium tungstate improved the blue part of the spectrum to yield an acceptable white light. Halophosphate-based phosphors replaced beryllium-based phosphors after beryllium was found to be toxic.[71]\n\n\nElectrolysis of a mixture of beryllium fluoride and sodium fluoride was used to isolate beryllium during the 19th century. The metal's high melting point makes this process more energy-consuming than corresponding processes used for the alkali metals.

It is believed that most of the stable beryllium in the universe was originally created in the interstellar medium when cosmic rays induced fission in heavier elements found in interstellar gas and dust.[15] Primordial beryllium contains only one stable isotope, 9Be, and therefore beryllium is a monoisotopic and mononuclidic element.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPure beryllium metal did not become readily available until 1957, even though it had been used as an alloying metal to harden and toughen copper much earlier.[32] Beryllium could be produced by reducing beryllium compounds such as beryllium chloride with metallic potassium or sodium. Currently, most beryllium is produced by reducing beryllium fluoride with magnesium.[73] The price on the American market for vacuum-cast beryllium ingots was about $338 per pound ($745 per kilogram) in 2001.[74]\n\n\nBetween 1998 and 2008, the world's production of beryllium had decreased from 343 to about 200 tonnes. It then increased to 230 tonnes by 2018, of which 170 tonnes came from the United States.[75][76]\n\n\n\n### Etymology[edit]\n\n\nNamed after beryl, a semiprecious mineral, from which it was first isolated.[77][78][79]\n\n\n\n## Applications[edit]\n\n\n### Radiation windows[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n8Be has a very short half-life of about 8×10−17 s that contributes to its significant cosmological role, as elements heavier than beryllium could not have been produced by nuclear fusion in the Big Bang.[19] This is due to the lack of sufficient time during the Big Bang's nucleosynthesis phase to produce carbon by the fusion of 4He nuclei and the very low concentrations of available beryllium-8. British astronomer Sir Fred Hoyle first showed that the energy levels of 8Be and 12C allow carbon production by the so-called triple-alpha process in helium-fueled stars where more nucleosynthesis time is available. This process allows carbon to be produced in stars, but not in the Big Bang. Star-created carbon (the basis of carbon-based life) is thus a component in the elements in the gas and dust ejected by AGB stars and supernovae (see also Big Bang nucleosynthesis), as well as the creation of all other elements with atomic numbers larger than that of carbon.[20]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ATSDR Case Studies in Environmental Medicine: Beryllium Toxicity U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n* It's Elemental – Beryllium\n* MSDS: ESPI Metals\n* Beryllium at *The Periodic Table of Videos* (University of Nottingham)\n* National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health – Beryllium Page\n* National Supplemental Screening Program (Oak Ridge Associated Universities)\n* Historic Price of Beryllium in USA\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nBeryllium compounds\n |\n| --- |\n| Beryllium(I) | * BeH\n |\n| Beryllium(II) | * Be(BH4)2\n* BeBr2\n* BeCO3\n* BeCl2\n* BeF2\n* BeH2\n* BeI2\n* Be(N3)2\n* Be(NO3)2\n* Be4O(C2H3O2)6\n* BeC2O4\n* BeO\n* Be(OH)2\n* BeS\n* BeSO4\n* BeTe\n* Be2C\n* *BeCrO4*\n* Be3N2\n\n\n\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Beryllium ore with 1US¢ coin for scale\n![](image)Emerald is a naturally occurring compound of beryllium.\nThe Sun has a concentration of 0.1 parts per billion (ppb) of beryllium.[24] Beryllium has a concentration of 2 to 6 parts per million (ppm) in the Earth's crust.[25] It is most concentrated in the soils, 6 ppm.[26] Trace amounts of 9Be are found in the Earth's atmosphere.[26] The concentration of beryllium in sea water is 0.2–0.6 parts per trillion.[26][27] In stream water, however, beryllium is more abundant with a concentration of 0.1 ppb.[28]\n\n\nBeryllium is found in over 100 minerals,[29] but most are uncommon to rare. The more common beryllium containing minerals include: bertrandite (Be4Si2O7(OH)2), beryl (Al2Be3Si6O18), chrysoberyl (Al2BeO4) and phenakite (Be2SiO4). Precious forms of beryl are aquamarine, red beryl and emerald.[11][30][31] \nThe green color in gem-quality forms of beryl comes from varying amounts of chromium (about 2% for emerald).[32]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n109. **^** Breslin AJ (1966). \"Ch. 3.

Identification is now performed using safe modern diagnostics techniques.[9] A successful test for beryllium in air and on surfaces has been developed and published as an international voluntary consensus standard ASTM D7202. The procedure uses dilute ammonium bifluoride for dissolution and fluorescence detection with beryllium bound to sulfonated hydroxybenzoquinoline, allowing up to 100 times more sensitive detection than the recommended limit for beryllium concentration in the workplace. Fluorescence increases with increasing beryllium concentration. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![{\\displaystyle {\\ce {Na_4[Be_6(OCH_2(O)O)_6]}}}](image), was isolated long ago.[45][46] Aromatic hydroxy ligands (i.e. phenols) form relatively strong complexes. For example, log K1 and log K2 values of 12.2 and 9.3 have been reported for complexes with tiron.[45][47]\n\n\nBeryllium has generally a rather poor affinity for ammine ligands.[45][48] Ligands such as EDTA behave as dicarboxylic acids.[*citation needed*] There are many early reports of complexes with amino acids, but unfortunately they are not reliable as the concomitant hydrolysis reactions were not understood at the time of publication. Values for log β of ca. 6 to 7 have been reported. The degree of formation is small because of competition with hydrolysis reactions.[45][48]\n\n\n\n### Organic chemistry[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 2s electrons of beryllium may contribute to chemical bonding. Therefore, when 7Be decays by L-electron capture, it does so by taking electrons from its atomic orbitals that may be participating in bonding. This makes its decay rate dependent to a measurable degree upon its chemical surroundings – a rare occurrence in nuclear decay.[21]\n\n\nThe shortest-lived known isotope of beryllium is 16Be, which decays through neutron emission with a half-life of 6.5×10−22 s.[22] The exotic isotopes 11Be and 14Be are known to exhibit a nuclear halo.[23] This phenomenon can be understood as the nuclei of 11Be and 14Be have, respectively, 1 and 4 neutrons orbiting substantially outside the classical Fermi 'waterdrop' model of the nucleus.\n\n\n\n### Occurrence[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe two main ores of beryllium, beryl and bertrandite, are found in Argentina, Brazil, India, Madagascar, Russia and the United States.[32] Total world reserves of beryllium ore are greater than 400,000 tonnes.[32]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\nThe extraction of beryllium from its compounds is a difficult process due to its high affinity for oxygen at elevated temperatures, and its ability to reduce water when its oxide film is removed. Currently the United States, China and Kazakhstan are the only three countries involved in the industrial-scale extraction of beryllium.[33] Kazakhstan produces beryllium from a concentrate stockpiled before the breakup of the Soviet Union around 1991. This resource had become nearly depleted by mid-2010s.[34]\n\n\nProduction of beryllium in Russia was halted in 1997, and is planned to be resumed in the 2020s.[35][36]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9  \n4Be  \n + n → 2 4  \n2He  \n + 2 n\nNeutrons are liberated when beryllium nuclei are struck by energetic alpha particles[11] producing the nuclear reaction\n\n\n\n9  \n4Be  \n + 4  \n2He  \n → 12  \n6C  \n + n\nwhere 4  \n2He  \n is an alpha particle and 12  \n6C  \n is a carbon-12 nucleus.[12]\nBeryllium also releases neutrons under bombardment by gamma rays. Thus, natural beryllium bombarded either by alphas or gammas from a suitable radioisotope is a key component of most radioisotope-powered nuclear reaction neutron sources for the laboratory production of free neutrons.\n\n\nSmall amounts of tritium are liberated when 9  \n4Be  \n nuclei absorb low energy neutrons in the three-step nuclear reaction\n\n\n\n9  \n4Be  \n + n → 4  \n2He  \n + 6  \n2He  \n,    6  \n2He  \n → 6  \n3Li  \n + β−,    6  \n3Li  \n + n → 4  \n2He  \n + 3  \n1H  \n\n6  \n2He  \n has a half-life of only 0.8 seconds, β− is an electron, and 6  \n3Li  \n has a high neutron absorption cross section.

When the slag is formulated into an abrasive agent for blasting paint and rust from hard surfaces, the beryllium can become airborne and become a source of exposure.[122]\n\n\nAlthough the use of beryllium compounds in fluorescent lighting tubes was discontinued in 1949, potential for exposure to beryllium exists in the nuclear and aerospace industries and in the refining of beryllium metal and melting of beryllium-containing alloys, the manufacturing of electronic devices, and the handling of other beryllium-containing material.[123]\n\n\n\n### Detection[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n62. **^** Vauquelin, Louis-Nicolas (1798). \"De l'Aiguemarine, ou Béril; et découverie d'une terre nouvelle dans cette pierre\" [Aquamarine or beryl; and discovery of a new earth in this stone]. *Annales de Chimie*. **26**: 155–169.

The modulus of elasticity of beryllium is approximately 35% greater than that of steel. The combination of this modulus and a relatively low density results in an unusually fast sound conduction speed in beryllium – about 12.9 km/s at ambient conditions. Other significant properties are high specific heat (1925 J·kg−1·K−1) and thermal conductivity (216 W·m−1·K−1), which make beryllium the metal with the best heat dissipation characteristics per unit weight. In combination with the relatively low coefficient of linear thermal expansion (11.4×10−6 K−1), these characteristics result in a unique stability under conditions of thermal loading.[11]\n\n\n\n### Nuclear properties[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe metal oxidizes in bulk (beyond the passivation layer) when heated above 500 °C (932 °F), and burns brilliantly when heated to about 2,500 °C (4,530 °F).\n\n\nThe commercial use of beryllium requires the use of appropriate dust control equipment and industrial controls at all times because of the toxicity of inhaled beryllium-containing dusts that can cause a chronic life-threatening allergic disease in some people called berylliosis.[10] Berylliosis causes pneumonia and other associated respiratory illness.\n\n\n\n\n## Characteristics[edit]\n\n\n### Physical properties[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n104. **^** \"VUE Audio announces use of Be in Pro Audio loudspeakers\". *VUE Audiotechnik*.

Beryllium has a large scattering cross section for high-energy neutrons, about 6 barns for energies above approximately 10 keV. Therefore, it works as a neutron reflector and neutron moderator, effectively slowing the neutrons to the thermal energy range of below 0.03 eV, where the total cross section is at least an order of magnitude lower; the exact value strongly depends on the purity and size of the crystallites in the material.\n\n\nThe single primordial beryllium isotope 9Be also undergoes a (n,2n) neutron reaction with neutron energies over about 1.9 MeV, to produce 8Be, which almost immediately breaks into two alpha particles. Thus, for high-energy neutrons, beryllium is a neutron multiplier, releasing more neutrons than it absorbs.

NIOSH also conducts genetic research on sensitization and CBD, independently of this collaboration.[119]\n\n\nAcute beryllium disease in the form of chemical pneumonitis was first reported in Europe in 1933 and in the United States in 1943. A survey found that about 5% of workers in plants manufacturing fluorescent lamps in 1949 in the United States had beryllium-related lung diseases.[120] Chronic berylliosis resembles sarcoidosis in many respects, and the differential diagnosis is often difficult. It killed some early workers in nuclear weapons design, such as Herbert L. Anderson.[121]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)A hollow beryllium sphere used in a gyrocompass of the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress aircraft[93]\nBeryllium is non-magnetic. Therefore, tools fabricated out of beryllium-based materials are used by naval or military explosive ordnance disposal teams for work on or near naval mines, since these mines commonly have magnetic fuzes.[94] They are also found in maintenance and construction materials near magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines because of the high magnetic fields generated.[95] In the fields of radio communications and powerful (usually military) radars, hand tools made of beryllium are used to tune the highly magnetic klystrons, magnetrons, traveling wave tubes, etc., that are used for generating high levels of microwave power in the transmitters.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Nuclear applications[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBeryllium hydroxide created using either the sinter or melt method is then converted into beryllium fluoride or beryllium chloride. To form the fluoride, aqueous ammonium hydrogen fluoride is added to beryllium hydroxide to yield a precipitate of ammonium tetrafluoroberyllate, which is heated to 1,000 °C (1,830 °F) to form beryllium fluoride.[9] Heating the fluoride to 900 °C (1,650 °F) with magnesium forms finely divided beryllium, and additional heating to 1,300 °C (2,370 °F) creates the compact metal.[9] Heating beryllium hydroxide forms the oxide, which becomes beryllium chloride when combined with carbon and chlorine. Electrolysis of molten beryllium chloride is then used to obtain the metal.[9]\n\n\n\n## Chemical properties[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Beryllium compounds\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt room temperature, the surface of beryllium forms a 1−10 nm-thick oxide passivation layer that prevents further reactions with air, except for gradual thickening of the oxide up to about 25 nm. When heated above about 500 °C, oxidation into the bulk metal progresses along grain boundaries.[40] Once the metal is ignited in air by heating above the oxide melting point around 2500 °C, beryllium burns brilliantly, forming a mixture of beryllium oxide and beryllium nitride. Beryllium dissolves readily in non-oxidizing acids, such as HCl and diluted H2SO4, but not in nitric acid or water as this forms the oxide. This behavior is similar to that of aluminium metal. Beryllium also dissolves in alkali solutions.[9][41]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nRadioactive cosmogenic 10Be is produced in the atmosphere of the Earth by the cosmic ray spallation of oxygen.[16] 10Be accumulates at the soil surface, where its relatively long half-life (1.36 million years) permits a long residence time before decaying to boron-10. Thus, 10Be and its daughter products are used to examine natural soil erosion, soil formation and the development of lateritic soils, and as a proxy for measurement of the variations in solar activity and the age of ice cores.[17] The production of 10Be is inversely proportional to solar activity, because increased solar wind during periods of high solar activity decreases the flux of galactic cosmic rays that reach the Earth.[16] Nuclear explosions also form 10Be by the reaction of fast neutrons with 13C in the carbon dioxide in air. This is one of the indicators of past activity at nuclear weapon test sites.[18]\nThe isotope 7Be (half-life 53 days) is also cosmogenic, and shows an atmospheric abundance linked to sunspots, much like 10Be.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBeryllium is also used at the Joint European Torus nuclear-fusion research laboratory, and it will be used in the more advanced ITER to condition the components which face the plasma.[98] Beryllium has also been proposed as a cladding material for nuclear fuel rods, because of its good combination of mechanical, chemical, and nuclear properties.[11] Beryllium fluoride is one of the constituent salts of the eutectic salt mixture FLiBe, which is used as a solvent, moderator and coolant in many hypothetical molten salt reactor designs, including the liquid fluoride thorium reactor (LFTR).[99]\n\n\n\n### Acoustics[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBinary compounds of beryllium(II) are polymeric in the solid state. BeF2 has a silica-like structure with corner-shared BeF4 tetrahedra. BeCl2 and BeBr2 have chain structures with edge-shared tetrahedra. Beryllium oxide, BeO, is a white refractory solid, which has the wurtzite crystal structure and a thermal conductivity as high as some metals. BeO is amphoteric. Beryllium sulfide, selenide and telluride are known, all having the zincblende structure.[42] Beryllium nitride, Be3N2 is a high-melting-point compound which is readily hydrolyzed. Beryllium azide, BeN6 is known and beryllium phosphide, Be3P2 has a similar structure to Be3N2. A number of beryllium borides are known, such as Be5B, Be4B, Be2B, BeB2, BeB6 and BeB12. Beryllium carbide, Be2C, is a refractory brick-red compound that reacts with water to give methane.[42] No beryllium silicide has been identified.[41]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBeryllium is most commonly extracted from the mineral beryl, which is either sintered using an extraction agent or melted into a soluble mixture. The sintering process involves mixing beryl with sodium fluorosilicate and soda at 770 °C (1,420 °F) to form sodium fluoroberyllate, aluminium oxide and silicon dioxide.[9] Beryllium hydroxide is precipitated from a solution of sodium fluoroberyllate and sodium hydroxide in water. Extraction of beryllium using the melt method involves grinding beryl into a powder and heating it to 1,650 °C (3,000 °F).[9] The melt is quickly cooled with water and then reheated 250 to 300 °C (482 to 572 °F) in concentrated sulfuric acid, mostly yielding beryllium sulfate and aluminium sulfate.[9] Aqueous ammonia is then used to remove the aluminium and sulfur, leaving beryllium hydroxide.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Beryllium copper adjustable wrench\nThe high elastic stiffness of beryllium has led to its extensive use in precision instrumentation, e.g. in inertial guidance systems and in the support mechanisms for optical systems.[11] Beryllium-copper alloys were also applied as a hardening agent in \"Jason pistols\", which were used to strip the paint from the hulls of ships.[88]\n\n\nBeryllium was also used for cantilevers in high performance phonograph cartridge styli, where its extreme stiffness and low density allowed for tracking weights to be reduced to 1 gram, yet still track high frequency passages with minimal distortion.[89]\n\n\nAn earlier major application of beryllium was in brakes for military airplanes because of its hardness, high melting point, and exceptional ability to dissipate heat. Environmental considerations have led to substitution by other materials.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBeryllium is also commonly used in some neutron sources in laboratory devices in which relatively few neutrons are needed (rather than having to use a nuclear reactor, or a particle accelerator-powered neutron generator). For this purpose, a target of beryllium-9 is bombarded with energetic alpha particles from a radioisotope such as polonium-210, radium-226, plutonium-238, or americium-241. In the nuclear reaction that occurs, a beryllium nucleus is transmuted into carbon-12, and one free neutron is emitted, traveling in about the same direction as the alpha particle was heading. Such alpha decay driven beryllium neutron sources, named \"urchin\" neutron initiators, were used in some early atomic bombs.[96] Neutron sources in which beryllium is bombarded with gamma rays from a gamma decay radioisotope, are also used to produce laboratory neutrons.[97]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBecause of its low atomic number and very low absorption for X-rays, the oldest and still one of the most important applications of beryllium is in radiation windows for X-ray tubes.[32] Extreme demands are placed on purity and cleanliness of beryllium to avoid artifacts in the X-ray images. Thin beryllium foils are used as radiation windows for X-ray detectors, and the extremely low absorption minimizes the heating effects caused by high intensity, low energy X-rays typical of synchrotron radiation. Vacuum-tight windows and beam-tubes for radiation experiments on synchrotrons are manufactured exclusively from beryllium. In scientific setups for various X-ray emission studies (e.g., energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) the sample holder is usually made of beryllium because its emitted X-rays have much lower energies (≈100 eV) than X-rays from most studied materials.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBeryllium\n| Hazards\n |\n| --- |\n| **GHS** labelling:[112] |\n| Pictograms\n | ![GHS06: Toxic](image) ![GHS08: Health hazard](image) |\n| Signal word\n | **Danger** |\n| Hazard statements\n | H301, H315, H317, H319, H330, H335, H350i, H372 |\n| Precautionary statements\n | P201, P202, P280, P302, P304, P305+P351+P338, P310, P340, P352 |\n| **NFPA 704** (fire diamond)\n | ![NFPA 704 four-colored diamond](image)\n4\n3\n3\n |\n\nChemical compound\n\n### Biological effects[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLow atomic number also makes beryllium relatively transparent to energetic particles. Therefore, it is used to build the beam pipe around the collision region in particle physics setups, such as all four main detector experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (ALICE, ATLAS, CMS, LHCb),[80] the Tevatron and at SLAC. The low density of beryllium allows collision products to reach the surrounding detectors without significant interaction, its stiffness allows a powerful vacuum to be produced within the pipe to minimize interaction with gases, its thermal stability allows it to function correctly at temperatures of only a few degrees above absolute zero, and its diamagnetic nature keeps it from interfering with the complex multipole magnet systems used to steer and focus the particle beams.[81]\n\n\n\n### Mechanical applications[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBeryllium oxide is useful for many applications that require the combined properties of an electrical insulator and an excellent heat conductor, with high strength and hardness, and a very high melting point. Beryllium oxide is frequently used as an insulator base plate in high-power transistors in radio frequency transmitters for telecommunications. Beryllium oxide is also being studied for use in increasing the thermal conductivity of uranium dioxide nuclear fuel pellets.[108] Beryllium compounds were used in fluorescent lighting tubes, but this use was discontinued because of the disease berylliosis which developed in the workers who were making the tubes.[109]\n\n\n\n### Healthcare[edit]\n\n\nBeryllium is a component of several dental alloys.[110][111]\n\n\n\n## Toxicity and safety[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Acute beryllium poisoning and Berylliosis\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the US, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has designated a permissible exposure limit (PEL) for beryllium and beryllium compounds of 0.2 µg/m3 as an 8-hour time-weighted average (TWA) and 2.0 µg/m3 as a short-term exposure limit over a sampling period of 15 minutes. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) upper-bound threshold of 0.5 µg/m3. The IDLH (immediately dangerous to life and health) value is 4 mg/m3.[116] The toxicity of beryllium is on par with other toxic metalloids/metals, such as arsenic and mercury.[117][118]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe new procedure has been successfully tested on a variety of surfaces and is effective for the dissolution and detection of refractory beryllium oxide and siliceous beryllium in minute concentrations (ASTM D7458).[124][125] The NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods contains methods for measuring occupational exposures to beryllium.[126]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn structural applications, the combination of high flexural rigidity, thermal stability, thermal conductivity and low density (1.85 times that of water) make beryllium metal a desirable aerospace material for aircraft components, missiles, spacecraft, and satellites.[9] Because of its low density and atomic mass, beryllium is relatively transparent to X-rays and other forms of ionizing radiation; therefore, it is the most common window material for X-ray equipment and components of particle detectors.[9] When added as an alloying element to aluminium, copper (notably the alloy beryllium copper), iron, or nickel, beryllium improves many physical properties.[9] For example, tools and components made of beryllium copper alloys are strong and hard and do not create sparks when they strike a steel surface. In air, the surface of beryllium oxidizes readily at room temperature to form a passivation layer 1–10 nm thick that protects it from further oxidation and corrosion. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBeryllium(II) forms few complexes with monodentate ligands because the water molecules in the aquo-ion, [Be(H2O)4]2+ are bound very strongly to the beryllium ion.

Such compounds obey the octet rule. Other 4-coordinate complexes such as the aqua-ion [Be(H2O)4]2+ also obey the octet rule.\n\n\n\n### Aqueous solutions[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBecause of its stiffness, light weight and dimensional stability over a wide temperature range, beryllium metal is used for lightweight structural components in the defense and aerospace industries in high-speed aircraft, guided missiles, spacecraft, and satellites, including the James Webb Space Telescope. Several liquid-fuel rockets have used rocket nozzles made of pure beryllium.[82][83] Beryllium powder was itself studied as a rocket fuel, but this use has never materialized.[32] A small number of extreme high-end bicycle frames have been built with beryllium.[84] From 1998 to 2000, the McLaren Formula One team used Mercedes-Benz engines with beryllium-aluminium-alloy pistons.[85] The use of beryllium engine components was banned following a protest by Scuderia Ferrari.[86]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThin plates or foils of beryllium are sometimes used in nuclear weapon designs as the very outer layer of the plutonium pits in the primary stages of thermonuclear bombs, placed to surround the fissile material. These layers of beryllium are good \"pushers\" for the implosion of the plutonium-239, and they are good neutron reflectors, just as in beryllium-moderated nuclear reactors.[96]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nApproximately 35 micrograms of beryllium is found in the average human body, an amount not considered harmful.[113] Beryllium is chemically similar to magnesium and therefore can displace it from enzymes, which causes them to malfunction.[113] Because Be2+ is a highly charged and small ion, it can easily get into many tissues and cells, where it specifically targets cell nuclei, inhibiting many enzymes, including those used for synthesizing DNA. Its toxicity is exacerbated by the fact that the body has no means to control beryllium levels, and once inside the body, beryllium cannot be removed.[114]\n\n\n\n### Inhalation[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope has 18 hexagonal beryllium sections for its mirrors, each plated with a thin layer of gold.[90] Because JWST will face a temperature of 33 K, the mirror is made of gold-plated beryllium, capable of handling extreme cold better than glass. Beryllium contracts and deforms less than glass – and remains more uniform – in such temperatures.[91] For the same reason, the optics of the Spitzer Space Telescope are entirely built of beryllium metal.[92]\n\n\n\n### Magnetic applications[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Schematic structure of basic beryllium acetate\n![](image)Beryllium hydrolysis. Water molecules attached to Be are omitted in this diagram\n![](image)Structure of the trimeric hydrolysis product of beryllium(II)\nSolutions of beryllium salts, such as beryllium sulfate and beryllium nitrate, are acidic because of hydrolysis of the [Be(H2O)4]2+ ion. The concentration of the first hydrolysis product, [Be(H2O)3(OH)]+, is less than 1% of the beryllium concentration. The most stable hydrolysis product is the trimeric ion [Be3(OH)3(H2O)6]3+. Beryllium hydroxide, Be(OH)2, is insoluble in water at pH 5 or more. Consequently, beryllium compounds are generally insoluble at biological pH. Because of this, inhalation of beryllium metal dust by people leads to the development of the fatal condition of berylliosis. Be(OH)2 dissolves in strongly alkaline solutions.[43]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_3SYz8fvXq2KTRL7JXPfRnsyQ","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

The original industrial involvement included subsidiaries and scientists related to the Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation in Cleveland, Ohio, and Siemens & Halske AG in Berlin. In the US, the process was ruled by Hugh S. Cooper, director of The Kemet Laboratories Company. In Germany, the first commercially successful process for producing beryllium was developed in 1921 by Alfred Stock and Hans Goldschmidt.[70]\n\n\nA sample of beryllium was bombarded with alpha rays from the decay of radium in a 1932 experiment by James Chadwick that uncovered the existence of the neutron.[32] This same method is used in one class of radioisotope-based laboratory neutron sources that produce 30 neutrons for every million α particles.[25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n14. **^** \"About Beryllium\".

It is a steel-gray, strong, lightweight and brittle alkaline earth metal. It is a divalent element that occurs naturally only in combination with other elements to form minerals. Gemstones high in beryllium include beryl (aquamarine, emerald, red beryl) and chrysoberyl. It is a relatively rare element in the universe, usually occurring as a product of the spallation of larger atomic nuclei that have collided with cosmic rays. Within the cores of stars, beryllium is depleted as it is fused into heavier elements. Beryllium constitutes about 0.0004 percent by mass of Earth's crust. The world's annual beryllium production of 220 tons is usually manufactured by extraction from the mineral beryl, a difficult process because beryllium bonds strongly to oxygen.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n121. **^** \"Photograph of Chicago Pile One Scientists 1946\".

Most early fluorescent lamps used zinc orthosilicate with varying content of beryllium to emit greenish light. Small additions of magnesium tungstate improved the blue part of the spectrum to yield an acceptable white light. Halophosphate-based phosphors replaced beryllium-based phosphors after beryllium was found to be toxic.[71]\n\n\nElectrolysis of a mixture of beryllium fluoride and sodium fluoride was used to isolate beryllium during the 19th century. The metal's high melting point makes this process more energy-consuming than corresponding processes used for the alkali metals. Early in the 20th century, the production of beryllium by the thermal decomposition of beryllium iodide was investigated following the success of a similar process for the production of zirconium, but this process proved to be uneconomical for volume production.[72]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n57. **^** Ruhlandt-Senge, Karin; Bartlett, Ruth A.; Olmstead, Marilyn M.; Power, Philip P.

It is believed that most of the stable beryllium in the universe was originally created in the interstellar medium when cosmic rays induced fission in heavier elements found in interstellar gas and dust.[15] Primordial beryllium contains only one stable isotope, 9Be, and therefore beryllium is a monoisotopic and mononuclidic element.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPure beryllium metal did not become readily available until 1957, even though it had been used as an alloying metal to harden and toughen copper much earlier.[32] Beryllium could be produced by reducing beryllium compounds such as beryllium chloride with metallic potassium or sodium. Currently, most beryllium is produced by reducing beryllium fluoride with magnesium.[73] The price on the American market for vacuum-cast beryllium ingots was about $338 per pound ($745 per kilogram) in 2001.[74]\n\n\nBetween 1998 and 2008, the world's production of beryllium had decreased from 343 to about 200 tonnes. It then increased to 230 tonnes by 2018, of which 170 tonnes came from the United States.[75][76]\n\n\n\n### Etymology[edit]\n\n\nNamed after beryl, a semiprecious mineral, from which it was first isolated.[77][78][79]\n\n\n\n## Applications[edit]\n\n\n### Radiation windows[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n8Be has a very short half-life of about 8×10−17 s that contributes to its significant cosmological role, as elements heavier than beryllium could not have been produced by nuclear fusion in the Big Bang.[19] This is due to the lack of sufficient time during the Big Bang's nucleosynthesis phase to produce carbon by the fusion of 4He nuclei and the very low concentrations of available beryllium-8. British astronomer Sir Fred Hoyle first showed that the energy levels of 8Be and 12C allow carbon production by the so-called triple-alpha process in helium-fueled stars where more nucleosynthesis time is available. This process allows carbon to be produced in stars, but not in the Big Bang. Star-created carbon (the basis of carbon-based life) is thus a component in the elements in the gas and dust ejected by AGB stars and supernovae (see also Big Bang nucleosynthesis), as well as the creation of all other elements with atomic numbers larger than that of carbon.[20]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ATSDR Case Studies in Environmental Medicine: Beryllium Toxicity U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n* It's Elemental – Beryllium\n* MSDS: ESPI Metals\n* Beryllium at *The Periodic Table of Videos* (University of Nottingham)\n* National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health – Beryllium Page\n* National Supplemental Screening Program (Oak Ridge Associated Universities)\n* Historic Price of Beryllium in USA\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nBeryllium compounds\n |\n| --- |\n| Beryllium(I) | * BeH\n |\n| Beryllium(II) | * Be(BH4)2\n* BeBr2\n* BeCO3\n* BeCl2\n* BeF2\n* BeH2\n* BeI2\n* Be(N3)2\n* Be(NO3)2\n* Be4O(C2H3O2)6\n* BeC2O4\n* BeO\n* Be(OH)2\n* BeS\n* BeSO4\n* BeTe\n* Be2C\n* *BeCrO4*\n* Be3N2\n\n\n\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Beryllium ore with 1US¢ coin for scale\n![](image)Emerald is a naturally occurring compound of beryllium.\nThe Sun has a concentration of 0.1 parts per billion (ppb) of beryllium.[24] Beryllium has a concentration of 2 to 6 parts per million (ppm) in the Earth's crust.[25] It is most concentrated in the soils, 6 ppm.[26] Trace amounts of 9Be are found in the Earth's atmosphere.[26] The concentration of beryllium in sea water is 0.2–0.6 parts per trillion.[26][27] In stream water, however, beryllium is more abundant with a concentration of 0.1 ppb.[28]\n\n\nBeryllium is found in over 100 minerals,[29] but most are uncommon to rare. The more common beryllium containing minerals include: bertrandite (Be4Si2O7(OH)2), beryl (Al2Be3Si6O18), chrysoberyl (Al2BeO4) and phenakite (Be2SiO4). Precious forms of beryl are aquamarine, red beryl and emerald.[11][30][31] \nThe green color in gem-quality forms of beryl comes from varying amounts of chromium (about 2% for emerald).[32]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n109. **^** Breslin AJ (1966). \"Ch. 3.

This makes its decay rate dependent to a measurable degree upon its chemical surroundings – a rare occurrence in nuclear decay.[21]\n\n\nThe shortest-lived known isotope of beryllium is 16Be, which decays through neutron emission with a half-life of 6.5×10−22 s.[22] The exotic isotopes 11Be and 14Be are known to exhibit a nuclear halo.[23] This phenomenon can be understood as the nuclei of 11Be and 14Be have, respectively, 1 and 4 neutrons orbiting substantially outside the classical Fermi 'waterdrop' model of the nucleus.\n\n\n\n### Occurrence[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe two main ores of beryllium, beryl and bertrandite, are found in Argentina, Brazil, India, Madagascar, Russia and the United States.[32] Total world reserves of beryllium ore are greater than 400,000 tonnes.[32]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\nThe extraction of beryllium from its compounds is a difficult process due to its high affinity for oxygen at elevated temperatures, and its ability to reduce water when its oxide film is removed. Currently the United States, China and Kazakhstan are the only three countries involved in the industrial-scale extraction of beryllium.[33] Kazakhstan produces beryllium from a concentrate stockpiled before the breakup of the Soviet Union around 1991. This resource had become nearly depleted by mid-2010s.[34]\n\n\nProduction of beryllium in Russia was halted in 1997, and is planned to be resumed in the 2020s.[35][36]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9  \n4Be  \n + n → 2 4  \n2He  \n + 2 n\nNeutrons are liberated when beryllium nuclei are struck by energetic alpha particles[11] producing the nuclear reaction\n\n\n\n9  \n4Be  \n + 4  \n2He  \n → 12  \n6C  \n + n\nwhere 4  \n2He  \n is an alpha particle and 12  \n6C  \n is a carbon-12 nucleus.[12]\nBeryllium also releases neutrons under bombardment by gamma rays. Thus, natural beryllium bombarded either by alphas or gammas from a suitable radioisotope is a key component of most radioisotope-powered nuclear reaction neutron sources for the laboratory production of free neutrons.\n\n\nSmall amounts of tritium are liberated when 9  \n4Be  \n nuclei absorb low energy neutrons in the three-step nuclear reaction\n\n\n\n9  \n4Be  \n + n → 4  \n2He  \n + 6  \n2He  \n,    6  \n2He  \n → 6  \n3Li  \n + β−,    6  \n3Li  \n + n → 4  \n2He  \n + 3  \n1H  \n\n6  \n2He  \n has a half-life of only 0.8 seconds, β− is an electron, and 6  \n3Li  \n has a high neutron absorption cross section. Tritium is a radioisotope of concern in nuclear reactor waste streams.[13]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBeryllium may be found in coal slag. When the slag is formulated into an abrasive agent for blasting paint and rust from hard surfaces, the beryllium can become airborne and become a source of exposure.[122]\n\n\nAlthough the use of beryllium compounds in fluorescent lighting tubes was discontinued in 1949, potential for exposure to beryllium exists in the nuclear and aerospace industries and in the refining of beryllium metal and melting of beryllium-containing alloys, the manufacturing of electronic devices, and the handling of other beryllium-containing material.[123]\n\n\n\n### Detection[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n62. **^** Vauquelin, Louis-Nicolas (1798). \"De l'Aiguemarine, ou Béril; et découverie d'une terre nouvelle dans cette pierre\" [Aquamarine or beryl; and discovery of a new earth in this stone]. *Annales de Chimie*. **26**: 155–169.

The modulus of elasticity of beryllium is approximately 35% greater than that of steel. The combination of this modulus and a relatively low density results in an unusually fast sound conduction speed in beryllium – about 12.9 km/s at ambient conditions. Other significant properties are high specific heat (1925 J·kg−1·K−1) and thermal conductivity (216 W·m−1·K−1), which make beryllium the metal with the best heat dissipation characteristics per unit weight. In combination with the relatively low coefficient of linear thermal expansion (11.4×10−6 K−1), these characteristics result in a unique stability under conditions of thermal loading.[11]\n\n\n\n### Nuclear properties[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe metal oxidizes in bulk (beyond the passivation layer) when heated above 500 °C (932 °F), and burns brilliantly when heated to about 2,500 °C (4,530 °F).\n\n\nThe commercial use of beryllium requires the use of appropriate dust control equipment and industrial controls at all times because of the toxicity of inhaled beryllium-containing dusts that can cause a chronic life-threatening allergic disease in some people called berylliosis.[10] Berylliosis causes pneumonia and other associated respiratory illness.\n\n\n\n\n## Characteristics[edit]\n\n\n### Physical properties[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n104. **^** \"VUE Audio announces use of Be in Pro Audio loudspeakers\". *VUE Audiotechnik*.

Beryllium has a large scattering cross section for high-energy neutrons, about 6 barns for energies above approximately 10 keV. Therefore, it works as a neutron reflector and neutron moderator, effectively slowing the neutrons to the thermal energy range of below 0.03 eV, where the total cross section is at least an order of magnitude lower; the exact value strongly depends on the purity and size of the crystallites in the material.\n\n\nThe single primordial beryllium isotope 9Be also undergoes a (n,2n) neutron reaction with neutron energies over about 1.9 MeV, to produce 8Be, which almost immediately breaks into two alpha particles. Thus, for high-energy neutrons, beryllium is a neutron multiplier, releasing more neutrons than it absorbs.

NIOSH also conducts genetic research on sensitization and CBD, independently of this collaboration.[119]\n\n\nAcute beryllium disease in the form of chemical pneumonitis was first reported in Europe in 1933 and in the United States in 1943. A survey found that about 5% of workers in plants manufacturing fluorescent lamps in 1949 in the United States had beryllium-related lung diseases.[120] Chronic berylliosis resembles sarcoidosis in many respects, and the differential diagnosis is often difficult. It killed some early workers in nuclear weapons design, such as Herbert L. Anderson.[121]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)A hollow beryllium sphere used in a gyrocompass of the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress aircraft[93]\nBeryllium is non-magnetic. Therefore, tools fabricated out of beryllium-based materials are used by naval or military explosive ordnance disposal teams for work on or near naval mines, since these mines commonly have magnetic fuzes.[94] They are also found in maintenance and construction materials near magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines because of the high magnetic fields generated.[95] In the fields of radio communications and powerful (usually military) radars, hand tools made of beryllium are used to tune the highly magnetic klystrons, magnetrons, traveling wave tubes, etc., that are used for generating high levels of microwave power in the transmitters.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Nuclear applications[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBeryllium hydroxide created using either the sinter or melt method is then converted into beryllium fluoride or beryllium chloride. To form the fluoride, aqueous ammonium hydrogen fluoride is added to beryllium hydroxide to yield a precipitate of ammonium tetrafluoroberyllate, which is heated to 1,000 °C (1,830 °F) to form beryllium fluoride.[9] Heating the fluoride to 900 °C (1,650 °F) with magnesium forms finely divided beryllium, and additional heating to 1,300 °C (2,370 °F) creates the compact metal.[9] Heating beryllium hydroxide forms the oxide, which becomes beryllium chloride when combined with carbon and chlorine. Electrolysis of molten beryllium chloride is then used to obtain the metal.[9]\n\n\n\n## Chemical properties[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Beryllium compounds\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt room temperature, the surface of beryllium forms a 1−10 nm-thick oxide passivation layer that prevents further reactions with air, except for gradual thickening of the oxide up to about 25 nm. When heated above about 500 °C, oxidation into the bulk metal progresses along grain boundaries.[40] Once the metal is ignited in air by heating above the oxide melting point around 2500 °C, beryllium burns brilliantly, forming a mixture of beryllium oxide and beryllium nitride. Beryllium dissolves readily in non-oxidizing acids, such as HCl and diluted H2SO4, but not in nitric acid or water as this forms the oxide. This behavior is similar to that of aluminium metal. Beryllium also dissolves in alkali solutions.[9][41]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nRadioactive cosmogenic 10Be is produced in the atmosphere of the Earth by the cosmic ray spallation of oxygen.[16] 10Be accumulates at the soil surface, where its relatively long half-life (1.36 million years) permits a long residence time before decaying to boron-10. Thus, 10Be and its daughter products are used to examine natural soil erosion, soil formation and the development of lateritic soils, and as a proxy for measurement of the variations in solar activity and the age of ice cores.[17] The production of 10Be is inversely proportional to solar activity, because increased solar wind during periods of high solar activity decreases the flux of galactic cosmic rays that reach the Earth.[16] Nuclear explosions also form 10Be by the reaction of fast neutrons with 13C in the carbon dioxide in air. This is one of the indicators of past activity at nuclear weapon test sites.[18]\nThe isotope 7Be (half-life 53 days) is also cosmogenic, and shows an atmospheric abundance linked to sunspots, much like 10Be.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBeryllium is also used at the Joint European Torus nuclear-fusion research laboratory, and it will be used in the more advanced ITER to condition the components which face the plasma.[98] Beryllium has also been proposed as a cladding material for nuclear fuel rods, because of its good combination of mechanical, chemical, and nuclear properties.[11] Beryllium fluoride is one of the constituent salts of the eutectic salt mixture FLiBe, which is used as a solvent, moderator and coolant in many hypothetical molten salt reactor designs, including the liquid fluoride thorium reactor (LFTR).[99]\n\n\n\n### Acoustics[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBinary compounds of beryllium(II) are polymeric in the solid state. BeF2 has a silica-like structure with corner-shared BeF4 tetrahedra. BeCl2 and BeBr2 have chain structures with edge-shared tetrahedra. Beryllium oxide, BeO, is a white refractory solid, which has the wurtzite crystal structure and a thermal conductivity as high as some metals. BeO is amphoteric. Beryllium sulfide, selenide and telluride are known, all having the zincblende structure.[42] Beryllium nitride, Be3N2 is a high-melting-point compound which is readily hydrolyzed. Beryllium azide, BeN6 is known and beryllium phosphide, Be3P2 has a similar structure to Be3N2. A number of beryllium borides are known, such as Be5B, Be4B, Be2B, BeB2, BeB6 and BeB12. Beryllium carbide, Be2C, is a refractory brick-red compound that reacts with water to give methane.[42] No beryllium silicide has been identified.[41]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBeryllium is most commonly extracted from the mineral beryl, which is either sintered using an extraction agent or melted into a soluble mixture. The sintering process involves mixing beryl with sodium fluorosilicate and soda at 770 °C (1,420 °F) to form sodium fluoroberyllate, aluminium oxide and silicon dioxide.[9] Beryllium hydroxide is precipitated from a solution of sodium fluoroberyllate and sodium hydroxide in water. Extraction of beryllium using the melt method involves grinding beryl into a powder and heating it to 1,650 °C (3,000 °F).[9] The melt is quickly cooled with water and then reheated 250 to 300 °C (482 to 572 °F) in concentrated sulfuric acid, mostly yielding beryllium sulfate and aluminium sulfate.[9] Aqueous ammonia is then used to remove the aluminium and sulfur, leaving beryllium hydroxide.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Beryllium copper adjustable wrench\nThe high elastic stiffness of beryllium has led to its extensive use in precision instrumentation, e.g. in inertial guidance systems and in the support mechanisms for optical systems.[11] Beryllium-copper alloys were also applied as a hardening agent in \"Jason pistols\", which were used to strip the paint from the hulls of ships.[88]\n\n\nBeryllium was also used for cantilevers in high performance phonograph cartridge styli, where its extreme stiffness and low density allowed for tracking weights to be reduced to 1 gram, yet still track high frequency passages with minimal distortion.[89]\n\n\nAn earlier major application of beryllium was in brakes for military airplanes because of its hardness, high melting point, and exceptional ability to dissipate heat. Environmental considerations have led to substitution by other materials.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBeryllium is also commonly used in some neutron sources in laboratory devices in which relatively few neutrons are needed (rather than having to use a nuclear reactor, or a particle accelerator-powered neutron generator). For this purpose, a target of beryllium-9 is bombarded with energetic alpha particles from a radioisotope such as polonium-210, radium-226, plutonium-238, or americium-241. In the nuclear reaction that occurs, a beryllium nucleus is transmuted into carbon-12, and one free neutron is emitted, traveling in about the same direction as the alpha particle was heading. Such alpha decay driven beryllium neutron sources, named \"urchin\" neutron initiators, were used in some early atomic bombs.[96] Neutron sources in which beryllium is bombarded with gamma rays from a gamma decay radioisotope, are also used to produce laboratory neutrons.[97]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBecause of its low atomic number and very low absorption for X-rays, the oldest and still one of the most important applications of beryllium is in radiation windows for X-ray tubes.[32] Extreme demands are placed on purity and cleanliness of beryllium to avoid artifacts in the X-ray images. Thin beryllium foils are used as radiation windows for X-ray detectors, and the extremely low absorption minimizes the heating effects caused by high intensity, low energy X-rays typical of synchrotron radiation. Vacuum-tight windows and beam-tubes for radiation experiments on synchrotrons are manufactured exclusively from beryllium. In scientific setups for various X-ray emission studies (e.g., energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) the sample holder is usually made of beryllium because its emitted X-rays have much lower energies (≈100 eV) than X-rays from most studied materials.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBeryllium\n| Hazards\n |\n| --- |\n| **GHS** labelling:[112] |\n| Pictograms\n | ![GHS06: Toxic](image) ![GHS08: Health hazard](image) |\n| Signal word\n | **Danger** |\n| Hazard statements\n | H301, H315, H317, H319, H330, H335, H350i, H372 |\n| Precautionary statements\n | P201, P202, P280, P302, P304, P305+P351+P338, P310, P340, P352 |\n| **NFPA 704** (fire diamond)\n | ![NFPA 704 four-colored diamond](image)\n4\n3\n3\n |\n\nChemical compound\n\n### Biological effects[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLow atomic number also makes beryllium relatively transparent to energetic particles. Therefore, it is used to build the beam pipe around the collision region in particle physics setups, such as all four main detector experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (ALICE, ATLAS, CMS, LHCb),[80] the Tevatron and at SLAC. The low density of beryllium allows collision products to reach the surrounding detectors without significant interaction, its stiffness allows a powerful vacuum to be produced within the pipe to minimize interaction with gases, its thermal stability allows it to function correctly at temperatures of only a few degrees above absolute zero, and its diamagnetic nature keeps it from interfering with the complex multipole magnet systems used to steer and focus the particle beams.[81]\n\n\n\n### Mechanical applications[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBeryllium oxide is useful for many applications that require the combined properties of an electrical insulator and an excellent heat conductor, with high strength and hardness, and a very high melting point. Beryllium oxide is frequently used as an insulator base plate in high-power transistors in radio frequency transmitters for telecommunications. Beryllium oxide is also being studied for use in increasing the thermal conductivity of uranium dioxide nuclear fuel pellets.[108] Beryllium compounds were used in fluorescent lighting tubes, but this use was discontinued because of the disease berylliosis which developed in the workers who were making the tubes.[109]\n\n\n\n### Healthcare[edit]\n\n\nBeryllium is a component of several dental alloys.[110][111]\n\n\n\n## Toxicity and safety[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Acute beryllium poisoning and Berylliosis\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the US, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has designated a permissible exposure limit (PEL) for beryllium and beryllium compounds of 0.2 µg/m3 as an 8-hour time-weighted average (TWA) and 2.0 µg/m3 as a short-term exposure limit over a sampling period of 15 minutes. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) upper-bound threshold of 0.5 µg/m3. The IDLH (immediately dangerous to life and health) value is 4 mg/m3.[116] The toxicity of beryllium is on par with other toxic metalloids/metals, such as arsenic and mercury.[117][118]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe new procedure has been successfully tested on a variety of surfaces and is effective for the dissolution and detection of refractory beryllium oxide and siliceous beryllium in minute concentrations (ASTM D7458).[124][125] The NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods contains methods for measuring occupational exposures to beryllium.[126]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn structural applications, the combination of high flexural rigidity, thermal stability, thermal conductivity and low density (1.85 times that of water) make beryllium metal a desirable aerospace material for aircraft components, missiles, spacecraft, and satellites.[9] Because of its low density and atomic mass, beryllium is relatively transparent to X-rays and other forms of ionizing radiation; therefore, it is the most common window material for X-ray equipment and components of particle detectors.[9] When added as an alloying element to aluminium, copper (notably the alloy beryllium copper), iron, or nickel, beryllium improves many physical properties.[9] For example, tools and components made of beryllium copper alloys are strong and hard and do not create sparks when they strike a steel surface. In air, the surface of beryllium oxidizes readily at room temperature to form a passivation layer 1–10 nm thick that protects it from further oxidation and corrosion. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBeryllium(II) forms few complexes with monodentate ligands because the water molecules in the aquo-ion, [Be(H2O)4]2+ are bound very strongly to the beryllium ion.

Other 4-coordinate complexes such as the aqua-ion [Be(H2O)4]2+ also obey the octet rule.\n\n\n\n### Aqueous solutions[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBecause of its stiffness, light weight and dimensional stability over a wide temperature range, beryllium metal is used for lightweight structural components in the defense and aerospace industries in high-speed aircraft, guided missiles, spacecraft, and satellites, including the James Webb Space Telescope. Several liquid-fuel rockets have used rocket nozzles made of pure beryllium.[82][83] Beryllium powder was itself studied as a rocket fuel, but this use has never materialized.[32] A small number of extreme high-end bicycle frames have been built with beryllium.[84] From 1998 to 2000, the McLaren Formula One team used Mercedes-Benz engines with beryllium-aluminium-alloy pistons.[85] The use of beryllium engine components was banned following a protest by Scuderia Ferrari.[86]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThin plates or foils of beryllium are sometimes used in nuclear weapon designs as the very outer layer of the plutonium pits in the primary stages of thermonuclear bombs, placed to surround the fissile material. These layers of beryllium are good \"pushers\" for the implosion of the plutonium-239, and they are good neutron reflectors, just as in beryllium-moderated nuclear reactors.[96]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nApproximately 35 micrograms of beryllium is found in the average human body, an amount not considered harmful.[113] Beryllium is chemically similar to magnesium and therefore can displace it from enzymes, which causes them to malfunction.[113] Because Be2+ is a highly charged and small ion, it can easily get into many tissues and cells, where it specifically targets cell nuclei, inhibiting many enzymes, including those used for synthesizing DNA. Its toxicity is exacerbated by the fact that the body has no means to control beryllium levels, and once inside the body, beryllium cannot be removed.[114]\n\n\n\n### Inhalation[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope has 18 hexagonal beryllium sections for its mirrors, each plated with a thin layer of gold.[90] Because JWST will face a temperature of 33 K, the mirror is made of gold-plated beryllium, capable of handling extreme cold better than glass. Beryllium contracts and deforms less than glass – and remains more uniform – in such temperatures.[91] For the same reason, the optics of the Spitzer Space Telescope are entirely built of beryllium metal.[92]\n\n\n\n### Magnetic applications[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Schematic structure of basic beryllium acetate\n![](image)Beryllium hydrolysis. Water molecules attached to Be are omitted in this diagram\n![](image)Structure of the trimeric hydrolysis product of beryllium(II)\nSolutions of beryllium salts, such as beryllium sulfate and beryllium nitrate, are acidic because of hydrolysis of the [Be(H2O)4]2+ ion. The concentration of the first hydrolysis product, [Be(H2O)3(OH)]+, is less than 1% of the beryllium concentration. The most stable hydrolysis product is the trimeric ion [Be3(OH)3(H2O)6]3+. Beryllium hydroxide, Be(OH)2, is insoluble in water at pH 5 or more. Consequently, beryllium compounds are generally insoluble at biological pH. Because of this, inhalation of beryllium metal dust by people leads to the development of the fatal condition of berylliosis. Be(OH)2 dissolves in strongly alkaline solutions.[43]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_3SYz8fvXq2KTRL7JXPfRnsyQ","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

In his subsequent experiments, he used potassium to reduce boric acid instead of electrolysis. He produced enough boron to confirm a new element and named it *boracium*.[10] Gay-Lussac and Thénard used iron to reduce boric acid at high temperatures. By oxidizing boron with air, they showed that boric acid is its oxidation product.[9][17] Jöns Jacob Berzelius identified it as an element in 1824.[18] Pure boron was arguably first produced by the American chemist Ezekiel Weintraub in 1909.[19][20][21]\n\n\n\n## Preparation of elemental boron in the laboratory[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n10. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Davy H (1809). \"An account of some new analytical researches on the nature of certain bodies, particularly the alkalies, phosphorus, sulphur, carbonaceous matter, and the acids hitherto undecomposed: with some general observations on chemical theory\". *Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London*. **99**: 39–104. doi:10.1098/rstl.1809.0005.\n11. **^** \"Q & A: Where does the element Boron come from?\". *physics.illinois.edu*.

Unlike most other p-elements, it rarely obeys the octet rule and usually places only six electrons[43] (in three molecular orbitals) onto its valence shell. Boron is the prototype for the boron group (the IUPAC group 13), although the other members of this group are metals and more typical p-elements (only aluminium to some extent shares boron's aversion to the octet rule).\n\n\nBoron also has much lower electronegativity than subsequent period 2 elements. For the latter, lithium salts are common e.g. lithium fluoride, lithium hydroxide, lithium amide, and methyllithium, but lithium boryllides are extraordinarily rare.[44][45] Strong bases do not deprotonate a borohydride R2BH to the boryl anion R2B−, instead forming the octet-complete adduct R2HB-base.[46]\n\n\n\n#### Chemical compounds[edit]\n\n\nMain article: boron compounds\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Van der Waals radius | 192 pm  |\n| ![Color lines in a spectral range](image)**Spectral lines of boron** |\n| Other properties |\n| Natural occurrence | primordial |\n| Crystal structure |  ​rhombohedral![Rhombohedral crystal structure for boron](image)\n |\n| Thermal expansion | β form: 5–7 µm/(m⋅K) (at 25 °C)[7] |\n| Thermal conductivity | 27.4 W/(m⋅K)  |\n| Electrical resistivity | ~106 Ω⋅m (at 20 °C)  |\n| Magnetic ordering | diamagnetic[8] |\n| Molar magnetic susceptibility | −6.7×10−6 cm3/mol[8] |\n| Speed of sound thin rod | 16,200 m/s (at 20 °C)  |\n| Mohs hardness | ~9.5  |\n| CAS Number | 7440-42-8  |\n| History |\n| Discovery | Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Louis Jacques Thénard[9] (30 June 1808) |\n| First isolation | Humphry Davy[10] (9 July 1808) |\n| Isotopes of boron* v\n* e\n |\n|  |\n| \n\n| Main isotopes\n | Decay |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | abun­dance | half-life (*t*1/2) | mode | pro­duct |\n| 8B\n | synth | 771.9 ms\n | β+ | 8Be\n |\n| 10B\n | 19.6%\n | stable |\n| 11B\n | 80.3%\n | stable\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nElemental boron is a metalloid that is found in small amounts in meteoroids, but chemically uncombined boron is not otherwise found naturally on Earth. Industrially, the very pure element is produced with difficulty because of contamination by carbon or other elements that resist removal.[13] Several allotropes exist: amorphous boron is a brown powder; crystalline boron is silvery to black, extremely hard (about 9.5 on the Mohs scale), and a poor electrical conductor at room temperature. The primary use of the element itself is as boron filaments with applications similar to carbon fibers in some high-strength materials.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n98. **^** *Fabrication and Evaluation of Urania-Alumina Fuel Elements and Boron Carbide Burnable Poison Elements Archived 27 July 2020 at the Wayback Machine*, Wisnyi, L.

Most studies of \"boron\" involve samples that contain small amounts of carbon. The chemical behavior of boron resembles that of silicon more than aluminium. Crystalline boron is chemically inert and resistant to attack by boiling hydrofluoric or hydrochloric acid. When finely divided, it is attacked slowly by hot concentrated hydrogen peroxide, hot concentrated nitric acid, hot sulfuric acid or hot mixture of sulfuric and chromic acids.[20]\n\n\nThe rate of oxidation of boron depends on the crystallinity, particle size, purity and temperature. Boron does not react with air at room temperature, but at higher temperatures it burns to form boron trioxide:[42]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)A fragment of ulexite\n![](image)Borax crystals\nBoron is rare in the Universe and solar system due to trace formation in the Big Bang and in stars. It is formed in minor amounts in cosmic ray spallation nucleosynthesis and may be found uncombined in cosmic dust and meteoroid materials.\n\n\nIn the high oxygen environment of Earth, boron is always found fully oxidized to borate. Boron does not appear on Earth in elemental form. Extremely small traces of elemental boron were detected in Lunar regolith.[69][70]\n\n\nAlthough boron is a relatively rare element in the Earth's crust, representing only 0.001% of the crust mass, it can be highly concentrated by the action of water, in which many borates are soluble.\nIt is found naturally combined in compounds such as borax and boric acid (sometimes found in volcanic spring waters).

Georgius Agricola, in around 1600, reported the use of borax as a flux in metallurgy. In 1777, boric acid was recognized in the hot springs (soffioni) near Florence, Italy, at which point it became known as *sal sedativum*, with ostensible medical benefits. The mineral was named sassolite, after Sasso Pisano in Italy. Sasso was the main source of European borax from 1827 to 1872, when American sources replaced it.[14][15] Boron compounds were relatively rarely used until the late 1800s when Francis Marion Smith's Pacific Coast Borax Company first popularized and produced them in volume at low cost.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Van Setten et al. 2007, pp. 2460–1\n2. **^** \"Standard Atomic Weights: Boron\".

However, the product is almost always contaminated with borides of those metals.[*citation needed*] Pure boron can be prepared by reducing volatile boron halides with hydrogen at high temperatures. Ultrapure boron for use in the semiconductor industry is produced by the decomposition of diborane at high temperatures and then further purified by the zone melting or Czochralski processes.[22]\n\n\nThe production of boron compounds does not involve the formation of elemental boron, but exploits the convenient availability of borates.\n\n\n\n## Characteristics[edit]\n\n\n### Allotropes[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Allotropes of boron\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBoron is synthesized entirely by cosmic ray spallation and supernovae and not by stellar nucleosynthesis, so it is a low-abundance element in the Solar System and in the Earth's crust.[11] It constitutes about 0.001 percent by weight of Earth's crust.[12] It is concentrated on Earth by the water-solubility of its more common naturally occurring compounds, the borate minerals.

More than one hundred borate minerals contain boron in oxidation state +3. These minerals resemble silicates in some respect, although it is often found not only in a tetrahedral coordination with oxygen, but also in a trigonal planar configuration. Unlike silicates, boron minerals never contain it with coordination number greater than four. A typical motif is exemplified by the tetraborate anions of the common mineral borax, shown at left. The formal negative charge of the tetrahedral borate center is balanced by metal cations in the minerals, such as the sodium (Na+) in borax.[42] The tourmaline group of borate-silicates is also a very important boron-bearing mineral group, and a number of borosilicates are also known to exist naturally.[47]\n\n\n\n##### Boranes[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Boranes\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n37. **^** Talley, C.

The mass difference results in a wide range of δ11B values, which are defined as a fractional difference between the 11B and 10B and traditionally expressed in parts per thousand, in natural waters ranging from −16 to +59. There are 13 known isotopes of boron; the shortest-lived isotope is 7B which decays through proton emission and alpha decay with a half-life of 3.5×10−22 s. Isotopic fractionation of boron is controlled by the exchange reactions of the boron species B(OH)3 and [B(OH)4]−. Boron isotopes are also fractionated during mineral crystallization, during H2O phase changes in hydrothermal systems, and during hydrothermal alteration of rock. The latter effect results in preferential removal of the [10B(OH)4]− ion onto clays. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe intersection of boron with biology is very small. Consensus on it as essential for mammalian life is lacking. Borates have low toxicity in mammals (similar to table salt) but are more toxic to arthropods and are occasionally used as insecticides.

Even nominally disordered (amorphous) boron contains regular boron icosahedra which are bonded randomly to each other without long-range order.[23][24] Crystalline boron is a very hard, black material with a melting point of above 2000 °C. It forms four major allotropes: α-rhombohedral [25] and β-rhombohedral [26] (α-R and β-R), γ-orthorhombic [27] (γ) and β-tetragonal [28] (β-T). All four phases are stable at ambient conditions, and β-rhombohedral is the most common and stable. An α-tetragonal phase also exists (α-T), but is very difficult to produce without significant contamination. Most of the phases are based on B12 icosahedra, but the γ phase can be described as a rocksalt-type arrangement of the icosahedra and B2 atomic pairs.[29] It can be produced by compressing other boron phases to 12–20 GPa and heating to 1500–1800 °C; it remains stable after releasing the temperature and pressure. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCertain other metal borides find specialized applications as hard materials for cutting tools.[55] Often the boron in borides has fractional oxidation states, such as −1/3 in calcium hexaboride (CaB6).\n\n\nFrom the structural perspective, the most distinctive chemical compounds of boron are the hydrides. Included in this series are the cluster compounds dodecaborate (B  \n12H2−  \n12), decaborane (B10H14), and the carboranes such as C2B10H12. Characteristically such compounds contain boron with coordination numbers greater than four.[42]\n\n\n\n### Isotopes[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Isotopes of boron\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe average cost of crystalline elemental boron is US$5/g.[81] Elemental boron is chiefly used in making boron fibers, where it is deposited by chemical vapor deposition on a tungsten core (see below). Boron fibers are used in lightweight composite applications, such as high strength tapes. This use is a very small fraction of total boron use. Boron is introduced into semiconductors as boron compounds, by ion implantation.\n\n\nEstimated global consumption of boron (almost entirely as boron compounds) was about 4 million tonnes of B2O3 in 2012. As compounds such as borax and kernite its cost was US$377/tonne in 2019.[82] Boron mining and refining capacities are considered to be adequate to meet expected levels of growth through the next decade.\n\n\nThe form in which boron is consumed has changed in recent years. The use of ores like colemanite has declined following concerns over arsenic content. Consumers have moved toward the use of refined borates and boric acid that have a lower pollutant content.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMagnesium diboride is an important superconducting material with the transition temperature of 39 K. MgB2 wires are produced with the powder-in-tube process and applied in superconducting magnets.[138][139]\n\n\nAmorphous boron is used as a melting point depressant in nickel-chromium braze alloys.[140]\n\n\nHexagonal boron nitride forms atomically thin layers, which have been used to enhance the electron mobility in graphene devices.[141][142] It also forms nanotubular structures (BNNTs), which have high strength, high chemical stability, and high thermal conductivity, among its list of desirable properties.[143]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe boranes (boron hydrogen compounds) and similar gaseous compounds are quite poisonous. As usual, boron is not an element that is intrinsically poisonous, but the toxicity of these compounds depends on structure (for another example of this phenomenon, see phosphine).[14][15] The boranes are also highly flammable and require special care when handling, some combinations of boranes and other compounds are highly explosive. Sodium borohydride presents a fire hazard owing to its reducing nature and the liberation of hydrogen on contact with acid. Boron halides are corrosive.[169]\n\n\n\n![](image)Boron toxicity in rose leaves.\nBoron is necessary for plant growth, but an excess of boron is toxic to plants, and occurs particularly in acidic soil.[170][171] It presents as a yellowing from the tip inwards of the oldest leaves and black spots in barley leaves, but it can be confused with other stresses such as magnesium deficiency in other plants.[172]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n88. **^** [1] Archived 6 October 2014 at the Wayback Machine Discussion of various types of boron addition to glass fibers in fiberglass.

Note two borons are trigonally bonded sp2 with no formal charge, while the other two borons are tetrahedrally bonded sp3, each carrying a formal charge of −1.

This mixture of boron coordination numbers and formal charges is characteristic of natural boron minerals.\nBoron undergoes halogenation to give trihalides; for example,\n\n\n\n2 B + 3 Br2 → 2 BBr3\nThe trichloride in practice is usually made from the oxide.[42]\n\n\n\n#### Atomic structure[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn humans, boron is usually consumed with food that contains boron, such as fruits, leafy vegetables, and nuts.[153] Foods that are particularly rich in boron include avocados, dried fruits such as raisins, peanuts, pecans, prune juice, grape juice, wine and chocolate powder.[155][153] According to 2-day food records from the respondents to the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), adult dietary intake was recorded at 0.9 to 1.4 mg/day.[157]\n\n\nIn 2013, a hypothesis suggested it was possible that boron and molybdenum catalyzed the production of RNA on Mars with life being transported to Earth via a meteorite around 3 billion years ago.[158]\n\n\nThere exist several known boron-containing natural antibiotics.[159] The first one found was boromycin, isolated from streptomyces in the 1960s.[160][161] Others are tartrolons, a group of antibiotics discovered in the 1990s from culture broth of the myxobacterium *Sorangium cellulosum*.[162]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nElemental boron, boron oxide, boric acid, borates, and many organoboron compounds are relatively nontoxic to humans and animals (with toxicity similar to that of table salt). The LD50 (dose at which there is 50% mortality) for animals is about 6 g per kg of body weight. Substances with LD50 above 2 g/kg are considered nontoxic. An intake of 4 g/day of boric acid was reported without incident, but more than this is considered toxic in more than a few doses. Intakes of more than 0.5 grams per day for 50 days cause minor digestive and other problems suggestive of toxicity.[167] Dietary supplementation of boron may be helpful for bone growth, wound healing, and antioxidant activity,[168] and insufficient amount of boron in diet may result in boron deficiency.\n\n\nSingle medical doses of 20 g of boric acid for neutron capture therapy have been used without undue toxicity.\n\n\nBoric acid is more toxic to insects than to mammals, and is routinely used as an insecticide.[107]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Boron (III) trifluoride structure, showing \"empty\" boron p orbital in pi-type coordinate covalent bonds\nIn the most familiar compounds, boron has the formal oxidation state III. These include oxides, sulfides, nitrides, and halides.[42]\n\n\nThe trihalides adopt a planar trigonal structure. These compounds are Lewis acids in that they readily form adducts with electron-pair donors, which are called Lewis bases. For example, fluoride (F−) and boron trifluoride (BF3) combined to give the tetrafluoroborate anion, BF4−. Boron trifluoride is used in the petrochemical industry as a catalyst. The halides react with water to form boric acid.[42]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBinary metal-boron compounds, the metal borides, contain boron in negative oxidation states. Illustrative is magnesium diboride (MgB2). Each boron atom has a formal −1 charge and magnesium is assigned a formal charge of +2. In this material, the boron centers are trigonal planar with an extra double bond for each boron, forming sheets akin to the carbon in graphite. However, unlike hexagonal boron nitride, which lacks electrons in the plane of the covalent atoms, the delocalized electrons in magnesium diboride allow it to conduct electricity similar to isoelectronic graphite. In 2001, this material was found to be a high-temperature superconductor.[52][53] It is a superconductor under active development. A project at CERN to make MgB2 cables has resulted in superconducting test cables able to carry 20,000 amperes for extremely high current distribution applications, such as the contemplated high luminosity version of the Large Hadron Collider.[54]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBoron is a useful dopant for such semiconductors as silicon, germanium, and silicon carbide. Having one fewer valence electron than the host atom, it donates a hole resulting in p-type conductivity. Traditional method of introducing boron into semiconductors is via its atomic diffusion at high temperatures. This process uses either solid (B2O3), liquid (BBr3), or gaseous boron sources (B2H6 or BF3). However, after the 1970s, it was mostly replaced by ion implantation, which relies mostly on BF3 as a boron source.[108] Boron trichloride gas is also an important chemical in semiconductor industry, however, not for doping but rather for plasma etching of metals and their oxides.[109] Triethylborane is also injected into vapor deposition reactors as a boron source.[110] Examples are the plasma deposition of boron-containing hard carbon films, silicon nitride–boron nitride films, and for doping of diamond film with boron.[111]\n\n\n\n### Magnets[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n134. **^** Miyatake SI, Wanibuchi M, Hu N, Ono K (August 2020). \"Boron neutron capture therapy for malignant brain tumors\". *J Neurooncol*. **149** (1): 1–11. doi:10.1007/s11060-020-03586-6. hdl:2433/226821.

In his subsequent experiments, he used potassium to reduce boric acid instead of electrolysis. He produced enough boron to confirm a new element and named it *boracium*.[10] Gay-Lussac and Thénard used iron to reduce boric acid at high temperatures. By oxidizing boron with air, they showed that boric acid is its oxidation product.[9][17] Jöns Jacob Berzelius identified it as an element in 1824.[18] Pure boron was arguably first produced by the American chemist Ezekiel Weintraub in 1909.[19][20][21]\n\n\n\n## Preparation of elemental boron in the laboratory[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n10. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Davy H (1809). \"An account of some new analytical researches on the nature of certain bodies, particularly the alkalies, phosphorus, sulphur, carbonaceous matter, and the acids hitherto undecomposed: with some general observations on chemical theory\". *Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London*. **99**: 39–104. doi:10.1098/rstl.1809.0005.\n11. **^** \"Q & A: Where does the element Boron come from?\". *physics.illinois.edu*.

The primary use of the element itself is as boron filaments with applications similar to carbon fibers in some high-strength materials.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n98. **^** *Fabrication and Evaluation of Urania-Alumina Fuel Elements and Boron Carbide Burnable Poison Elements Archived 27 July 2020 at the Wayback Machine*, Wisnyi, L.

Most studies of \"boron\" involve samples that contain small amounts of carbon. The chemical behavior of boron resembles that of silicon more than aluminium. Crystalline boron is chemically inert and resistant to attack by boiling hydrofluoric or hydrochloric acid. When finely divided, it is attacked slowly by hot concentrated hydrogen peroxide, hot concentrated nitric acid, hot sulfuric acid or hot mixture of sulfuric and chromic acids.[20]\n\n\nThe rate of oxidation of boron depends on the crystallinity, particle size, purity and temperature. Boron does not react with air at room temperature, but at higher temperatures it burns to form boron trioxide:[42]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)A fragment of ulexite\n![](image)Borax crystals\nBoron is rare in the Universe and solar system due to trace formation in the Big Bang and in stars. It is formed in minor amounts in cosmic ray spallation nucleosynthesis and may be found uncombined in cosmic dust and meteoroid materials.\n\n\nIn the high oxygen environment of Earth, boron is always found fully oxidized to borate. Boron does not appear on Earth in elemental form. Extremely small traces of elemental boron were detected in Lunar regolith.[69][70]\n\n\nAlthough boron is a relatively rare element in the Earth's crust, representing only 0.001% of the crust mass, it can be highly concentrated by the action of water, in which many borates are soluble.\nIt is found naturally combined in compounds such as borax and boric acid (sometimes found in volcanic spring waters).

Some crude borax traveled westward, and was apparently mentioned by the alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan around 700 AD. Marco Polo brought some glazes back to Italy in the 13th century. Georgius Agricola, in around 1600, reported the use of borax as a flux in metallurgy. In 1777, boric acid was recognized in the hot springs (soffioni) near Florence, Italy, at which point it became known as *sal sedativum*, with ostensible medical benefits. The mineral was named sassolite, after Sasso Pisano in Italy. Sasso was the main source of European borax from 1827 to 1872, when American sources replaced it.[14][15] Boron compounds were relatively rarely used until the late 1800s when Francis Marion Smith's Pacific Coast Borax Company first popularized and produced them in volume at low cost.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Van Setten et al. 2007, pp. 2460–1\n2. **^** \"Standard Atomic Weights: Boron\".

Together these constitute 90% of mined boron-containing ore. The largest global borax deposits known, many still untapped, are in Central and Western Turkey, including the provinces of Eskişehir, Kütahya and Balıkesir.[73][74][75] Global proven boron mineral mining reserves exceed one billion metric tonnes, against a yearly production of about four million tonnes.[76]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n158. **^** \"Primordial broth of life was a dry Martian cup-a-soup\". *New Scientist*. 29 August 2013.

More than one hundred borate minerals contain boron in oxidation state +3. These minerals resemble silicates in some respect, although it is often found not only in a tetrahedral coordination with oxygen, but also in a trigonal planar configuration. Unlike silicates, boron minerals never contain it with coordination number greater than four. A typical motif is exemplified by the tetraborate anions of the common mineral borax, shown at left. The formal negative charge of the tetrahedral borate center is balanced by metal cations in the minerals, such as the sodium (Na+) in borax.[42] The tourmaline group of borate-silicates is also a very important boron-bearing mineral group, and a number of borosilicates are also known to exist naturally.[47]\n\n\n\n##### Boranes[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Boranes\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n37. **^** Talley, C.

The mass difference results in a wide range of δ11B values, which are defined as a fractional difference between the 11B and 10B and traditionally expressed in parts per thousand, in natural waters ranging from −16 to +59. There are 13 known isotopes of boron; the shortest-lived isotope is 7B which decays through proton emission and alpha decay with a half-life of 3.5×10−22 s. Isotopic fractionation of boron is controlled by the exchange reactions of the boron species B(OH)3 and [B(OH)4]−. Boron isotopes are also fractionated during mineral crystallization, during H2O phase changes in hydrothermal systems, and during hydrothermal alteration of rock. The latter effect results in preferential removal of the [10B(OH)4]− ion onto clays. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe intersection of boron with biology is very small.

Even nominally disordered (amorphous) boron contains regular boron icosahedra which are bonded randomly to each other without long-range order.[23][24] Crystalline boron is a very hard, black material with a melting point of above 2000 °C. It forms four major allotropes: α-rhombohedral [25] and β-rhombohedral [26] (α-R and β-R), γ-orthorhombic [27] (γ) and β-tetragonal [28] (β-T). All four phases are stable at ambient conditions, and β-rhombohedral is the most common and stable. An α-tetragonal phase also exists (α-T), but is very difficult to produce without significant contamination. Most of the phases are based on B12 icosahedra, but the γ phase can be described as a rocksalt-type arrangement of the icosahedra and B2 atomic pairs.[29] It can be produced by compressing other boron phases to 12–20 GPa and heating to 1500–1800 °C; it remains stable after releasing the temperature and pressure. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCertain other metal borides find specialized applications as hard materials for cutting tools.[55] Often the boron in borides has fractional oxidation states, such as −1/3 in calcium hexaboride (CaB6).\n\n\nFrom the structural perspective, the most distinctive chemical compounds of boron are the hydrides. Included in this series are the cluster compounds dodecaborate (B  \n12H2−  \n12), decaborane (B10H14), and the carboranes such as C2B10H12. Characteristically such compounds contain boron with coordination numbers greater than four.[42]\n\n\n\n### Isotopes[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Isotopes of boron\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe average cost of crystalline elemental boron is US$5/g.[81] Elemental boron is chiefly used in making boron fibers, where it is deposited by chemical vapor deposition on a tungsten core (see below). Boron fibers are used in lightweight composite applications, such as high strength tapes. This use is a very small fraction of total boron use. Boron is introduced into semiconductors as boron compounds, by ion implantation.\n\n\nEstimated global consumption of boron (almost entirely as boron compounds) was about 4 million tonnes of B2O3 in 2012. As compounds such as borax and kernite its cost was US$377/tonne in 2019.[82] Boron mining and refining capacities are considered to be adequate to meet expected levels of growth through the next decade.\n\n\nThe form in which boron is consumed has changed in recent years. The use of ores like colemanite has declined following concerns over arsenic content. Consumers have moved toward the use of refined borates and boric acid that have a lower pollutant content.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMagnesium diboride is an important superconducting material with the transition temperature of 39 K. MgB2 wires are produced with the powder-in-tube process and applied in superconducting magnets.[138][139]\n\n\nAmorphous boron is used as a melting point depressant in nickel-chromium braze alloys.[140]\n\n\nHexagonal boron nitride forms atomically thin layers, which have been used to enhance the electron mobility in graphene devices.[141][142] It also forms nanotubular structures (BNNTs), which have high strength, high chemical stability, and high thermal conductivity, among its list of desirable properties.[143]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe boranes (boron hydrogen compounds) and similar gaseous compounds are quite poisonous. As usual, boron is not an element that is intrinsically poisonous, but the toxicity of these compounds depends on structure (for another example of this phenomenon, see phosphine).[14][15] The boranes are also highly flammable and require special care when handling, some combinations of boranes and other compounds are highly explosive. Sodium borohydride presents a fire hazard owing to its reducing nature and the liberation of hydrogen on contact with acid. Boron halides are corrosive.[169]\n\n\n\n![](image)Boron toxicity in rose leaves.\nBoron is necessary for plant growth, but an excess of boron is toxic to plants, and occurs particularly in acidic soil.[170][171] It presents as a yellowing from the tip inwards of the oldest leaves and black spots in barley leaves, but it can be confused with other stresses such as magnesium deficiency in other plants.[172]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n88. **^** [1] Archived 6 October 2014 at the Wayback Machine Discussion of various types of boron addition to glass fibers in fiberglass.

The LD50 (dose at which there is 50% mortality) for animals is about 6 g per kg of body weight. Substances with LD50 above 2 g/kg are considered nontoxic. An intake of 4 g/day of boric acid was reported without incident, but more than this is considered toxic in more than a few doses. Intakes of more than 0.5 grams per day for 50 days cause minor digestive and other problems suggestive of toxicity.[167] Dietary supplementation of boron may be helpful for bone growth, wound healing, and antioxidant activity,[168] and insufficient amount of boron in diet may result in boron deficiency.\n\n\nSingle medical doses of 20 g of boric acid for neutron capture therapy have been used without undue toxicity.\n\n\nBoric acid is more toxic to insects than to mammals, and is routinely used as an insecticide.[107]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Boron (III) trifluoride structure, showing \"empty\" boron p orbital in pi-type coordinate covalent bonds\nIn the most familiar compounds, boron has the formal oxidation state III. These include oxides, sulfides, nitrides, and halides.[42]\n\n\nThe trihalides adopt a planar trigonal structure. These compounds are Lewis acids in that they readily form adducts with electron-pair donors, which are called Lewis bases. For example, fluoride (F−) and boron trifluoride (BF3) combined to give the tetrafluoroborate anion, BF4−. Boron trifluoride is used in the petrochemical industry as a catalyst. The halides react with water to form boric acid.[42]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBinary metal-boron compounds, the metal borides, contain boron in negative oxidation states. Illustrative is magnesium diboride (MgB2). Each boron atom has a formal −1 charge and magnesium is assigned a formal charge of +2. In this material, the boron centers are trigonal planar with an extra double bond for each boron, forming sheets akin to the carbon in graphite. However, unlike hexagonal boron nitride, which lacks electrons in the plane of the covalent atoms, the delocalized electrons in magnesium diboride allow it to conduct electricity similar to isoelectronic graphite. In 2001, this material was found to be a high-temperature superconductor.[52][53] It is a superconductor under active development. A project at CERN to make MgB2 cables has resulted in superconducting test cables able to carry 20,000 amperes for extremely high current distribution applications, such as the contemplated high luminosity version of the Large Hadron Collider.[54]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBoron is a useful dopant for such semiconductors as silicon, germanium, and silicon carbide. Having one fewer valence electron than the host atom, it donates a hole resulting in p-type conductivity. Traditional method of introducing boron into semiconductors is via its atomic diffusion at high temperatures. This process uses either solid (B2O3), liquid (BBr3), or gaseous boron sources (B2H6 or BF3). However, after the 1970s, it was mostly replaced by ion implantation, which relies mostly on BF3 as a boron source.[108] Boron trichloride gas is also an important chemical in semiconductor industry, however, not for doping but rather for plasma etching of metals and their oxides.[109] Triethylborane is also injected into vapor deposition reactors as a boron source.[110] Examples are the plasma deposition of boron-containing hard carbon films, silicon nitride–boron nitride films, and for doping of diamond film with boron.[111]\n\n\n\n### Magnets[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n134. **^** Miyatake SI, Wanibuchi M, Hu N, Ono K (August 2020). \"Boron neutron capture therapy for malignant brain tumors\". *J Neurooncol*. **149** (1): 1–11. doi:10.1007/s11060-020-03586-6. hdl:2433/226821.
