Listed by the GaWC as an alpha global city, São Paulo is the most populous city outside of Asia and the world's 4th largest city proper by population. Additionally, São Paulo is the largest Portuguese-speaking city in the world. It exerts strong international influences in commerce, finance, arts and entertainment.[8] The city's name honors the Apostle, Saint Paul of Tarsus. The city's metropolitan area, the Greater São Paulo, ranks as the most populous in Brazil and the 12th most populous on Earth. The process of conurbation between the metropolitan areas around the Greater São Paulo (Campinas, Santos, Jundiaí, Sorocaba and São José dos Campos) created the São Paulo Macrometropolis,[9] a megalopolis with more than 30 million inhabitants, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMost populous city in Brazil\n\nThis article is about the city.

With the First and Second World Wars and the Great Depression, coffee exports to the United States and Europe were heavily affected, forcing the rich coffee growers to invest in the industrial activities that would make São Paulo the largest industrial center in Brazil. The new job vacancies contributed to attract a significant number of immigrants (mainly from Italy)[171] and migrants, especially from the Northeastern states.[172] From a population of only 32.000 people in 1880, São Paulo now had 8.5 million inhabitants in 1980. The rapid population growth has brought many problems for the city.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe per capita income for the city was R$32,493 in 2008.[151] According to Mercer's 2011 city rankings of cost of living for expatriate employees, São Paulo is now among the ten most expensive cities in the world, ranking 10th in 2011, up from 21st in 2010 and ahead of London, Paris, Milan and New York City.[152][153]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe metropolis is also home to several of the tallest skyscrapers in Brazil, including the Mirante do Vale, Edifício Itália, Banespa, North Tower and many others. The city has cultural, economic and political influence nationally and internationally. It is home to monuments, parks and museums such as the Latin American Memorial, the Ibirapuera Park, Museum of Ipiranga, São Paulo Museum of Art, and the Museum of the Portuguese Language. The city holds events like the São Paulo Jazz Festival, São Paulo Art Biennial, the Brazilian Grand Prix, São Paulo Fashion Week, the ATP Brasil Open, the Brasil Game Show and the Comic Con Experience.

The legally defined *Região Metropolitana de São Paulo* consists of 39 municipalities in total and a population of 21.1 million[107] inhabitants (as of the 2014 National Census[update]).\n\n\nThe Metropolitan Region of São Paulo is known as the financial, economic, and cultural center of Brazil. Among the largest municipalities, Guarulhos, with a population of more than 1 million people is the biggest one. Several others count more than 100,000 inhabitants, such as São Bernardo do Campo (811,000 inh.) and Santo André (707,000 inh.) in the ABC Region. The ABC Region, comprising Santo André, São Bernardo do Campo and São Caetano do Sul in the south of Grande São Paulo, is an important location for industrial corporations, such as Volkswagen and Ford Motors.[108]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n29. **^** Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). \"São Paulo\".

This migration grew enormously in the 1930s and remained huge in the next decades. The concentration of land, modernization in rural areas, changes in work relationships and cycles of droughts stimulated migration. Northeastern migrants live mainly in hazardous and unhealthy areas of the city, in cortiços *(\"guettos\")*, in favelas *(\"slums\")* of the metropolis, because they offer cheaper housing. The largest concentration of northeastern migrants was found in the area of Sé/Brás (districts of Brás, Bom Retiro, Cambuci, Pari and Sé). In this area they composed 41% of the population.[106][*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Metropolitan area[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Greater São Paulo and São Paulo Macrometropolis\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* There were more than 30,000 homeless people in 2021 according to official data. It increased by 31% in two years, and doubled in 20 years.[115]\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Brazil\n\nThe primary language is Portuguese. The general language from São Paulo General, or Tupi Austral (Southern Tupi), was the Tupi-based trade language of what is now São Vicente, São Paulo, and the upper Tietê River. In the 17th century it was widely spoken in São Paulo and spread to neighboring regions while in Brazil. From 1750 on, following orders from Marquess of Pombal, Portuguese language was introduced through immigration and consequently taught to children in schools. The original Tupi Austral language subsequently lost ground to Portuguese, and eventually became extinct. Due to the large influx of Japanese, German, Spanish, Italian and Arab immigrants etc., the Portuguese idiom spoken in the metropolitan area of São Paulo reflects influences from those languages.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | **Jaçanã/Tremembé** | 64.1 km2 | 255 435\n |\n| 10\n | **Guaianases** | 17.8 km2 | 283 162\n | 26\n | **Santo Amaro** | 37.5 km2 | 217 280\n |\n| 11\n | **Ipiranga** | 37.5 km2 | 427 585\n | 27\n | **São Mateus** | 45.8 km2 | 422 199\n |\n| 12\n | **Itaim Paulista** | 21.7 km2 | 358 888\n | 28\n | **São Miguel Paulista** | 24.3 km2 | 377 540\n |\n| 13\n | **Itaquera** | 54.3 km2 | 488 327\n | 29\n | **Sapopemba** | 13.4 km2 | 296 042\n |\n| 14\n | **Jabaquara** | 14.1 km2 | 214 200\n | 30\n | **Vila Maria/Vila Guilherme** | 26.4 km2 | 302 899\n |\n| 15\n | **Lapa** | 40.1 km2 | 270 102\n | 31\n | **Vila Mariana** | 26.5 km2 | 311 019\n |\n| 16\n | **M'Boi Mirim** | 62.1 km2 | 523 138\n | 32\n | **Vila Prudente** | 33.3 km2 | 480 823\n |\n\n\n### International relations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of twin towns and sister cities in Brazil\n\nSão Paulo is twinned with:[136]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)University of São Paulo\nSão Paulo has public and private primary and secondary schools and vocational-technical schools.

This led wealthy coffee farmers to invest in industrial activities that turned São Paulo into Brazil's largest industrial hub.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSão Paulo has a myriad of urban fabrics. The original nuclei of the city are vertical, characterized by the presence of commercial buildings and services; And the peripheries are generally developed with two to four-story buildings – although such generalization certainly meets with exceptions in the fabric of the metropolis. Compared to other global cities (such as the island cities of New York City and Hong Kong), however, São Paulo is considered a \"low-rise building\" city. Its tallest buildings rarely reach forty stories, and the average residential building is twenty. Nevertheless, it is the fourth city in the world in quantity of buildings, according to the page specialized in research of data on buildings *Emporis Buildings*,[174] besides possessing what was considered until 2014 the tallest skyscraper of the country, the Mirante do Vale, also known as *Palácio Zarzur Kogan*, with 170 meters of height and 51 floors.[175]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSão Paulo is considered the most multicultural city in Brazil.

The city consumes an average of 221 liters of water/inhabitant/day while the UN recommends the consumption of 110 liters/day. The water loss is 30.8%. However, between 11 and 12.8% of households do not have a sewage system, depositing waste in pits and ditches. Sixty percent of the sewage collected is treated. According to data from IBGE and Eletropaulo, the electricity grid serves almost 100% of households. The fixed telephony network is still precarious, with coverage of 67.2%. Household garbage collection covers all regions of the municipality but is still insufficient, reaching around 94% of the demand in districts such as Parelheiros and Perus. About 80% of the garbage produced daily by Paulistas is exported to other cities, such as Caieiras and Guarulhos.[173] Recycling accounts for about 1% of the 15,000 metric tons of waste produced daily.[173]\n\n\n\n### Urban planning[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n197. **^** \"São Paulo – 2014 soccer world cup host city\".

Around the 1720s, gold was found by the pioneers in the regions near what are now Cuiabá and Goiânia. The Portuguese expanded their Brazilian territory beyond the Tordesillas Line to incorporate the gold regions. When the gold ran out in the late 18th century, São Paulo shifted to growing sugar cane. Cultivation of this commodity crop spread through the interior of the Captaincy. The sugar was exported through the Port of Santos. At that time, the first modern highway between São Paulo and the coast was constructed and named the Calçada do Lorena *(\"Lorena's settway\")*.

The process of conurbation between the metropolitan areas around the Greater São Paulo (Campinas, Santos, Jundiaí, Sorocaba and São José dos Campos) created the São Paulo Macrometropolis,[9] a megalopolis with more than 30 million inhabitants, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMost populous city in Brazil\n\nThis article is about the city.

With the First and Second World Wars and the Great Depression, coffee exports to the United States and Europe were heavily affected, forcing the rich coffee growers to invest in the industrial activities that would make São Paulo the largest industrial center in Brazil. The new job vacancies contributed to attract a significant number of immigrants (mainly from Italy)[171] and migrants, especially from the Northeastern states.[172] From a population of only 32.000 people in 1880, São Paulo now had 8.5 million inhabitants in 1980.

The city holds events like the São Paulo Jazz Festival, São Paulo Art Biennial, the Brazilian Grand Prix, São Paulo Fashion Week, the ATP Brasil Open, the Brasil Game Show and the Comic Con Experience.

This migration grew enormously in the 1930s and remained huge in the next decades. The concentration of land, modernization in rural areas, changes in work relationships and cycles of droughts stimulated migration. Northeastern migrants live mainly in hazardous and unhealthy areas of the city, in cortiços *(\"guettos\")*, in favelas *(\"slums\")* of the metropolis, because they offer cheaper housing. The largest concentration of northeastern migrants was found in the area of Sé/Brás (districts of Brás, Bom Retiro, Cambuci, Pari and Sé). In this area they composed 41% of the population.[106][*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Metropolitan area[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Greater São Paulo and São Paulo Macrometropolis\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* There were more than 30,000 homeless people in 2021 according to official data.

The general language from São Paulo General, or Tupi Austral (Southern Tupi), was the Tupi-based trade language of what is now São Vicente, São Paulo, and the upper Tietê River. In the 17th century it was widely spoken in São Paulo and spread to neighboring regions while in Brazil. From 1750 on, following orders from Marquess of Pombal, Portuguese language was introduced through immigration and consequently taught to children in schools. The original Tupi Austral language subsequently lost ground to Portuguese, and eventually became extinct. Due to the large influx of Japanese, German, Spanish, Italian and Arab immigrants etc., the Portuguese idiom spoken in the metropolitan area of São Paulo reflects influences from those languages.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | **Jaçanã/Tremembé** | 64.1 km2 | 255 435\n |\n| 10\n | **Guaianases** | 17.8 km2 | 283 162\n | 26\n | **Santo Amaro** | 37.5 km2 | 217 280\n |\n| 11\n | **Ipiranga** | 37.5 km2 | 427 585\n | 27\n | **São Mateus** | 45.8 km2 | 422 199\n |\n| 12\n | **Itaim Paulista** | 21.7 km2 | 358 888\n | 28\n | **São Miguel Paulista** | 24.3 km2 | 377 540\n |\n| 13\n | **Itaquera** | 54.3 km2 | 488 327\n | 29\n | **Sapopemba** | 13.4 km2 | 296 042\n |\n| 14\n | **Jabaquara** | 14.1 km2 | 214 200\n | 30\n | **Vila Maria/Vila Guilherme** | 26.4 km2 | 302 899\n |\n| 15\n | **Lapa** | 40.1 km2 | 270 102\n | 31\n | **Vila Mariana** | 26.5 km2 | 311 019\n |\n| 16\n | **M'Boi Mirim** | 62.1 km2 | 523 138\n | 32\n | **Vila Prudente** | 33.3 km2 | 480 823\n |\n\n\n### International relations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of twin towns and sister cities in Brazil\n\nSão Paulo is twinned with:[136]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)University of São Paulo\nSão Paulo has public and private primary and secondary schools and vocational-technical schools.

Favelas went back into the urban perimeter, occupying the small lots not yet occupied by urbanization – alongside polluted rivers, railways, or between bridges.[184] By 1993, 19.8% of São Paulo's population lived in favelas, compared to 5.2% in 1980.[185] Today, it is estimated that 2.1 million Paulistas live in favelas, which represents about 11% of the metropolitan area's population.[186]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nPanoramic view of Central Zone of São Paulo from Italy Building\n\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Transport in São Paulo and Transport in Brazil\n\n#### Roads[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nBandeirantes Highway/SP-348\n![](image)\nMario Covas Beltway\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nBrazil articles\n |\n| --- |\n| History | * Timeline\n* Indigenous peoples\n* Colonial Brazil (1500–1815)\n* United Kingdom (1815–1822)\n* Empire (1822–1889)\n* First (Old) Republic (1889–1930)\n* Vargas Era (1930–1946)\n* Fourth Republic (1946–1964)\n* Military dictatorship (1964–1985)\n* Sixth (New) Republic (1985–present)\n |\n| Geography | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Amazon basin\n* Brazilian Antarctica\n* Climate\n\t+ Climate change\n* Coastline\n* Environment\n\t+ Environmental issues\n* Extreme points\n* Geology\n* Islands\n* Largest cities\n* Mountains\n* Pantanal\n* Protected areas\n* Regions\n* Rivers\n* Time Zone\n* Water resources\n* Wildlife\n* World Heritage Sites\n |\n\n |\n| Politics | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Administrative divisions\n* Constitution\n* Elections\n* Foreign relations\n* Government\n* Human rights\n\t+ Freedom of speech\n\t+ LGBT\n\t+ Women's rights\n* Judiciary\n* Law\n* Law enforcement\n* Military\n* National Congress\n* Political parties\n* President of the Republic\n |\n\n |\n| Economy | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n95. **^** \"Programa Saúde da Família atende imigrantes\".

São Paulo grew strong in the national political scene, taking turns with the also rich state of Minas Gerais in electing Brazilian presidents, an alliance that became known as \"coffee and milk\", given that Minas Gerais was famous for its dairy production. During this period, São Paulo went from regional center to national metropolis, becoming industrialized and reaching its first million inhabitants in 1928. Its greatest growth in this period was relative in the 1890s when it doubled its population. The height of the coffee period is represented by the construction of the second Luz Station (the present building) at the end of the 19th century and by the Paulista Avenue in 1900, where they built many mansions.[25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to the International Congress & Convention Association, São Paulo ranks first among the cities that host international events in Americas and the 12th in the world, after Vienna, Paris, Barcelona, Singapore, Berlin, Budapest, Amsterdam, Stockholm, Seoul, Lisbon, and Copenhagen.[167] According to a study by MasterCard in 130 cities around the world, São Paulo was the third most visited destination in Latin America (behind Mexico City and Buenos Aires) with 2.4 million foreign travelers, who spent US$2.9 billion in 2013 (the highest among the cities in the region).

The original nuclei of the city are vertical, characterized by the presence of commercial buildings and services; And the peripheries are generally developed with two to four-story buildings – although such generalization certainly meets with exceptions in the fabric of the metropolis. Compared to other global cities (such as the island cities of New York City and Hong Kong), however, São Paulo is considered a \"low-rise building\" city. Its tallest buildings rarely reach forty stories, and the average residential building is twenty. Nevertheless, it is the fourth city in the world in quantity of buildings, according to the page specialized in research of data on buildings *Emporis Buildings*,[174] besides possessing what was considered until 2014 the tallest skyscraper of the country, the Mirante do Vale, also known as *Palácio Zarzur Kogan*, with 170 meters of height and 51 floors.[175]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSão Paulo is considered the most multicultural city in Brazil.

According to data from IBGE and Eletropaulo, the electricity grid serves almost 100% of households. The fixed telephony network is still precarious, with coverage of 67.2%. Household garbage collection covers all regions of the municipality but is still insufficient, reaching around 94% of the demand in districts such as Parelheiros and Perus. About 80% of the garbage produced daily by Paulistas is exported to other cities, such as Caieiras and Guarulhos.[173] Recycling accounts for about 1% of the 15,000 metric tons of waste produced daily.[173]\n\n\n\n### Urban planning[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n197. **^** \"São Paulo – 2014 soccer world cup host city\".

The Portuguese expanded their Brazilian territory beyond the Tordesillas Line to incorporate the gold regions. When the gold ran out in the late 18th century, São Paulo shifted to growing sugar cane. Cultivation of this commodity crop spread through the interior of the Captaincy. The sugar was exported through the Port of Santos. At that time, the first modern highway between São Paulo and the coast was constructed and named the Calçada do Lorena *(\"Lorena's settway\")*.

It receives the most visitors per year of any city in South America with 2.82 million international tourists a year.[194]\n\n\nThe city boasts world-class hotels, like Belmond Copacabana Palace, approximately 80 kilometers of beaches and the famous Corcovado, Sugarloaf mountains and Maracanã Stadium. While the city had in past had a thriving tourism sector, the industry entered a decline in the last quarter of the 20th century. Annual international airport arrivals dropped from 621,000 to 378,000 and average hotel occupancy dropped to 50% between 1985 and 1993.[195] The fact that Brasília replaced Rio de Janeiro as the Brazilian capital in 1960 and that São Paulo replaced Rio as the country's commercial, financial and main cultural center during the mid-20th century, has also been cited as a leading cause of the decline.[196]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n\n\n\nRio de Janeiro city (1890)\n| Group | Population | Percentage[88] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Portuguese immigrants | 106,461 | 20.4%\n |\n| Brazilians with at least one Portuguese parent | 161,203 | 30.8%\n |\n| Portuguese immigrants and their descendants | 267,664 | 51.2%\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe population of the city of Rio de Janeiro, occupying an area of 1,182.3 km2 (456.5 sq mi),[39] is about 6,000,000.[40] The population of the greater metropolitan area is estimated at 11–13.5 million.

Its securities market, although declining in significance relative to São Paulo, is still of major importance. Recent decades have seen a sharp transformation in its economic profile, which is becoming more and more one of a major national hub of services and businesses.[183] The city is the headquarters of large telecom companies, such as Intelig, Oi and Embratel. Major Brazilian entertainment and media organizations are based in Rio de Janeiro like Organizações Globo and also some of Brazil's major newspapers: *Jornal do Brasil*, *O Dia*, and *Business Rio*.\n\n\nTourism and entertainment are other key aspects of the city's economic life.

People of Portuguese ancestry predominate in most of the state. The Brazilian census of 1920 showed that 39.7% of the Portuguese who lived in Brazil lived in Rio de Janeiro. Including all of the Rio de Janeiro, the proportion raised to 46.3% of the Portuguese who lived in Brazil. The numerical presence of the Portuguese was extremely high, accounting for 72% of the foreigners who lived in the capital. Portuguese born people accounted for 20.4% of the population of Rio, and those with a Portuguese father or a Portuguese mother accounted for 30.8%. In other words, native born Portuguese and their children accounted for 51.2% of the inhabitants of Rio, or a total of 267,664 people in 1890.[87]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTo attract industry, the state government has designated certain areas on the outskirts of the city as industrial districts where infrastructure is provided and land sales are made under special conditions. Oil and natural gas from fields off the northern coast of Rio de Janeiro state are a major asset used for developing manufacturing activities in Rio's metropolitan area, enabling it to compete with other major cities for new investment in industry.[185]\n\n\nOwing to the proximity of Rio's port facilities, many of Brazil's export-import companies are headquartered in the city. In Greater Rio, which has one of the highest per capita incomes in Brazil, retail trade is substantial. Many of the most important retail stores are located in the center, but others are scattered throughout the commercial areas of the other districts, where shopping centers, supermarkets, and other retail businesses handle a large volume of consumer trade.[186]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nRio de Janeiro is one of the most visited cities in the Southern Hemisphere and is known for its natural settings, carnival, samba, bossa nova, and balneario beaches[12] such as Barra da Tijuca, Copacabana, Ipanema, and Leblon. In addition to the beaches, some of the most famous landmarks include the giant statue of *Christ the Redeemer* atop Corcovado mountain, named one of the New Seven Wonders of the World; Sugarloaf Mountain with its cable car; the *Sambódromo* (Sambadrome), a permanent grandstand-lined parade avenue which is used during Carnival; and Maracanã Stadium, one of the world's largest football stadiums. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs a result of the influx of immigrants to Brazil from the late 19th to the early 20th century, also found in Rio de Janeiro and its metropolitan area are communities of Levantine Arabs who are mostly Christian or Irreligious, Spaniards, Italians, Germans, Japanese,[89] Jews, and people from other parts of Brazil. The main waves of internal migration came from people of African, mixed or older Portuguese (as descendants of early settlers) descent from Minas Gerais and people of Eastern European, Swiss, Italian, German, Portuguese and older Portuguese-Brazilian heritage from Espírito Santo in the early and mid-20th century, together with people with origins in Northeastern Brazil, in the mid-to-late and late 20th century, as well some in the early 21st century (the latter more directed to peripheries than the city's core).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDespite the change in the federal capital, 59% of civil servants in the Executive Branch of federal agencies and public companies remained in the city. Rio de Janeiro is also the only Brazilian state where the number of federal employees exceeds the number of state employees. About a third of all federal public bodies and companies remain in the former capital, with 50 public offices, including agencies, autarchies, foundations and public companies, such as the National Library, the National Nuclear Energy Commission, Fiocruz, BNDES, Petrobras, Eletrobras, IBGE, Casa da Moeda, the National Archives, among others.[123]\n\n\n\n### Subdivisions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Municipality of Rio de Janeiro and its division into zones and neighborhoods \n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| West Zone\n | North Zone\n | South Zone\n | Central Zone\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe off-shore oil exploration in the Campos Basin began in 1968 and became the main site for oil production of Brazil. This caused many oil and gas companies to be based in Rio de Janeiro, such as the Brazilian branches of Shell, EBX and Esso.

Rio de Janeiro became an attractive place for companies to locate when it was the capital of Brazil, as important sectors of society and of the government were present in the city, even when their factories were located in other cities or states. The city was chosen as headquarters for state-owned companies such as Petrobras, Eletrobras, Caixa Econômica Federal, National Economic and Social Development Bank and Vale (which was privatized in the 1990s). The Rio de Janeiro Stock Exchange (BVRJ), which currently trades only government securities, was the first stock exchange founded in Brazil in 1845. Despite the transfer of the capital to Brasília in 1960, many of these headquarters remained within the Rio metropolitan area.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSubprefectures are officially grouped into four regions (or \"zones\"), taking into account geographic position and occupation history; however these do not have any administrative or political power over the municipality. The official political division of the municipality takes into account historical-cultural characteristics to divide the neighborhoods.[125] Most of its population is concentrated in the neighborhoods of Campo Grande, Santa Cruz, Bangu, Tijuca, Realengo, Jacarepaguá, Copacabana, Barra da Tijuca, Maré, Guaratiba and Taquara together, these eleven neighborhoods concentrate a population of 1.5 million inhabitants, according to the 2010 census.[126]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Maracanã Stadium\n![](image)Nilton Santos Olympic Stadium\nAs in the rest of Brazil, association football is the most popular sport. The city's major teams are Flamengo, Vasco da Gama, Fluminense and Botafogo. Madureira, Bangu, Portuguesa, America and Bonsucesso are small clubs. Famous players born in the city include Zico, Romário and Ronaldo.[254] Rio de Janeiro was one of the host cities of the 1950 and 2014 FIFA World Cups, for which on both occasions Brazil was the host nation. In 1950, the Maracanã Stadium hosted 8 matches, including all but one of the host team's matches. The Maracanã was also the location of the infamous tournament-deciding match between Uruguay and Brazil, where Brazil only needed a draw to win the final group stage and the whole tournament. Brazil ended up losing 2–1 in front of a home crowd of more than 199,000. In 2014, the Maracanã hosted seven matches, including the final, where Germany beat Argentina 1–0.[255]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n113. **^** Marly Silva da Motta (2001). \"O lugar da cidade do Rio de Janeiro na Federação brasileira:uma questão em três momentos\" (PDF) (in Brazilian Portuguese).

As there was no physical space or urban structure to accommodate hundreds of noblemen who arrived suddenly, many inhabitants were simply evicted from their homes.[21] In the first decade, several educational establishments were created, such as the Military Academy, the Royal School of Sciences, Arts and Crafts and the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts, as well as the National Library of Brazil – with the largest collection in Latin America[22] – and The Botanical Garden. The first printed newspaper in Brazil, the *Gazeta do Rio de Janeiro*, came into circulation during this period.[23] When Brazil was elevated to Kingdom in 1815, it became the capital of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves until the return of the Portuguese Royal Family to Lisbon in 1821, but remained as capital of the Kingdom of Brazil.[24]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n13. **^** \"BBC Sport, Rio to stage 2016 Olympic Games\". *BBC News*. 2 October 2009.

Its architecture embraces churches and buildings dating from the 16th to the 19th centuries, blending with the world-renowned designs of the 20th century. Rio was home to the Portuguese Imperial family and capital of the country for many years, and was influenced by Portuguese, English, and French architecture.[233]\n\n\nRio de Janeiro has inherited a strong cultural role from the past. In the late 19th century, there were sessions held of the first Brazilian film and since then, several production cycles have spread out, eventually placing Rio at the forefront of experimental and national cinema. The Rio de Janeiro International Film Festival[234] has been held annually since 1999.[235]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Santa Cruz Air Force Base\n* Santos Dumont Airport\n* Rio de Janeiro/Galeão International Airport\n* Jacarepaguá Airport\n |\n| Related | * Category:People from Rio de Janeiro (city)\n* Carioca\n* Demographics of Rio de Janeiro\n* Municipal Chamber of Rio de Janeiro\n* Project Morrinho\n* Category:Sport in Rio de Janeiro (city)\n |\n| * ![](image) Rio de Janeiro\n* ![](image) Category\n* ![](image) Outline\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![](image) Municipalities of Rio de Janeiro\n |\n| --- |\n| Capital: **Rio de Janeiro**\n |\n| Mesoregion  Baixadas | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Bacia de São João | * Casimiro de Abreu\n* Rio das Ostras\n* Silva Jardim\n |\n| Lagos | * Araruama\n* Armação dos Búzios\n* Arraial do Cabo\n* Cabo Frio\n* Iguaba Grande\n* São Pedro da Aldeia\n* Saquarema\n |\n\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Mesoregion  Centro Fluminense | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn Rio de Janeiro, the executive power is represented by the mayor and the cabinet of secretaries, in accordance with the model proposed by the Federal Constitution. The Organic Law of the Municipality and the current Master Plan, however, stipulate that the public administration must provide the population with effective tools for the exercise of participatory democracy. In this way, the city is divided into subprefectures, each of which is headed by a sub-mandatory appointed directly by the mayor.[113]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Portuguese immigrant in Rio de Janeiro, considered the largest \"Portuguese city\" outside Portugal[86]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe black community was formed by residents whose ancestors had been brought as slaves, mostly from Angola and Mozambique, as well by people of Angolan, Mozambican and West African descent who moved to Rio from other parts of Brazil. The samba (from Bahia with Angolan influence) and the famous local version of the carnival (from Europe) first appeared under the influence of the black community in the city. Today, nearly half of the city's population is by phenotype perceptibly black or part black.[81] A large majority has some recent sub-Saharan ancestor. White in Brazil is defined more by having a European-looking phenotype rather than ancestry, and two full siblings can be of different \"racial\" categories[82] in a skin color and phenotype continuum from *pálido* (*branco*) or fair-skinned, through *branco moreno* or swarthy Caucasian, *mestiço claro* or lighter skinned multiracial, *pardo* (mixed race) to *negro* or black. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn Brazil, most interstate transportation is done by road. A large terminal for long-distance buses is in the Santo Cristo neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro. There are also two port facilities for cargo and passenger ships (Rio de Janeiro and Sepetiba port). Rio has roads to all neighbor States. Some roads (like Via Dutra, to São Paulo, and a stretch of the BR-101 which covers the Rio-Niterói bridge) were chartered to private enterprises. The quality of the highways improved much, but was accompanied by a significant increase of the toll fees. From São Paulo: take the BR-116 (Presidente Dutra Federal Highway) or the BR-101 (Rio-Santos Federal Highway). From Belo Horizonte: BR-040. From Salvador: BR-101 or BR-324/BR-116/BR-393/BR-040.\n\n\n\n### Bicycles[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs a political center of the country, Rio concentrated the political-partisan life of the Empire. It was the main stage of the abolitionist and republican movements in the last half of the 19th century.[24] At that time the number of slaves was drastically reduced and the city was developed, with modern drains, animal trams, train stations crossing the city, gas and electric lighting, telephone and telegraph wiring, water and river plumbing.[24] Rio continued as the capital of Brazil after 1889, when the monarchy was replaced by a republic.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n123. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Por que o Rio deveria virar um segundo Distrito Federal, segundo este pesquisador\". *Nexo Jornal*.

Twenty years later, in 2012, the city hosted another conference on sustainable development, named United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development. The city hosted the World Youth Day in 2013, the second World Youth Day in South America and first in Brazil. In the sports field, Rio de Janeiro was the host of the 2007 Pan American Games and the 2014 FIFA World Cup Final. On 2 October 2009, the International Olympic Committee announced that Rio de Janeiro would host the 2016 Olympic Games and the 2016 Paralympic Games, beating competitors Chicago, Tokyo, and Madrid. The city became the first South American city to host the event and the second Latin American city (after Mexico City in 1968) to host the Games. Since the early 2010s, Rio de Janeiro has been inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its arts, urban culture and designed landscapes set around a natural environment.\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Rio-Niterói Bridge\nDriving in Rio de Janeiro, as in most large cities of Brazil, might not be the best choice because of the large car numbers. The city is served by a number of expressways, like Linha Vermelha, Linha Amarela, Avenida Brasil, Avenida das Américas and Avenida Infante Dom Henrique (Aterro do Flamengo); in spite of this, traffic jams are very common.[229] Because of the organization of the 2016 Olympics the city is installing four BRT systems to link Barra da Tijuca with other major neighborhoods: TransOlimpica (between Barra and Deodoro); TransBrasil (over the Avenida Brasil expressway); TransCarioca (between Barra and the Galeão International Airport); and TransOeste (between Barra and Santa Cruz, over Avenida das Américas).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFrom the colonial period until the first independent era, Rio de Janeiro was a city of slaves. There was a large influx of African slaves to Rio de Janeiro: in 1819, there were 145,000 slaves in the captaincy. In 1840, the number of slaves reached 220,000 people.[25] Between 1811 and 1831, 500,000 to a million slaves arrived in Rio de Janeiro through Valongo Wharf, which is now a World Heritage Site.[26] The Port of Rio de Janeiro was the largest port of slaves in America.[27]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nBotafogo Bay in 1869\n![](image)\nBotafogo Bay in 1889\n\n### Empire[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Jacarepaguá-Roberto Marinho Airport: used by general aviation and home to the Aeroclube do Brasil (Brasil Flying club). The airport is located in the district of Baixada de Jacarepaguá, within the municipality of Rio de Janeiro approximately 30 km (19 mi) from the city center.[202]\n\n\nMilitary airports include:\n\n\n\n* Galeão Air Force Base: A Brazilian Air Force airbase, sharing some facilities with Galeão - Antônio Carlos Jobim International Airport;\n* Santa Cruz Air Force Base: A Brazilian Air Force airbase. Formerly called Bartolomeu de Gusmão Airport, it was built by the Luftschiffbau Zeppelin. Today it is one of the most important Air Force Bases in Brazil;\n* Afonsos Air Force Base: One of the historical Brazilian Air Force airbases. It is also the location of the University of the Air Force (Universidade da Força Aérea),[203] the Museu Aeroespacial,[204] and where air shows take place.\n\n\n### Ports[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFounded in 1565 by the Portuguese, the city was initially the seat of the Captaincy of Rio de Janeiro, a domain of the Portuguese Empire. In 1763, it became the capital of the State of Brazil, a state of the Portuguese Empire. In 1808, when the Portuguese Royal Court moved to Brazil, Rio de Janeiro became the seat of the court of Queen Maria I of Portugal. She subsequently, under the leadership of her son the prince regent John VI of Portugal, raised Brazil to the dignity of a kingdom, within the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and Algarves. Rio remained as the capital of the pluricontinental monarchy until 1822, when the Brazilian War of Independence began. This is one of the few instances in history that the capital of a colonizing country officially shifted to a city in one of its colonies. Rio de Janeiro subsequently served as the capital of the independent monarchy, the Empire of Brazil, until 1889, and then the capital of a republican Brazil until 1960 when the capital was transferred to Brasília.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n48. **^** \"For rowers in Rio's Olympic water, it's all about avoiding the splash\". *Chicago Tribune*.

On 21 April of that year, the capital of Brazil was officially moved to Brasília. The territory of the former Federal District became its own state, Guanabara, after the bay that borders it to the east, encompassing just the city of Rio de Janeiro. After the 1964 coup d'état that installed a military dictatorship, the city-state was the only state left in Brazil to oppose the military. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe city is commonly divided into the historic center (Centro); the tourist-friendly wealthier South Zone (Zona Sul); the residential less wealthy North Zone (Zona Norte); peripheries in the West Zone (Zona Oeste), among them Santa Cruz, Campo Grande and the wealthy newer Barra da Tijuca district. Rio de Janeiro is administratively divided into 33 *distritos* (districts) named *Regiões Administrativas* (\"Administrative Regions\") and 164 *bairros* (neighborhoods).[124]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n38. **^** Rio de Janeiro – History.com Articles, Video, Pictures and Facts Archived 22 August 2011 at the Wayback Machine\n39. **^** \"Area Territorial Official\" (in Portuguese).

The Centro also houses the modern concrete Rio de Janeiro Cathedral. Around the Cinelândia square, there are several landmarks of the *Belle Époque* of Rio, such as the Municipal Theatre and the National Library building.

Pereira Passos, who was named mayor in 1902, imposed reforms to modernize the city, demolishing the cortiços where most of the poor population lived. These people, mostly descendants of slaves, then moved to live in the city's hills, creating the first favelas.[30] Inspired by the city of Paris, Passos built the Municipal Theatre, the National Museum of Fine Arts and the National Library in the city's center; brought electric power to Rio and created larger avenues to adapt the city to automobiles.[31] Passos also named Oswaldo Cruz as Director General of Public Health. Cruz's plans to clean the city of diseases included compulsory vaccination of the entire population and forced entry into houses to kill mosquitoes and rats. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Rio das Pedras\n* Rio Grande\n* Silvestre\n* Terreirão do Rio Bonito\n* Triagem\n* Usina\n* Vila Aliança\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![](image) Municipalities of Rio de Janeiro\n |\n| --- |\n| Capital: **Rio de Janeiro**\n |\n| Mesoregion  Baixadas | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Bacia de São João | * Casimiro de Abreu\n* Rio das Ostras\n* Silva Jardim\n |\n| Lagos | * Araruama\n* Armação dos Búzios\n* Arraial do Cabo\n* Cabo Frio\n* Iguaba Grande\n* São Pedro da Aldeia\n* Saquarema\n |\n\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Mesoregion  Centro Fluminense | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Cantagalo-Cordeiro | * Cantagalo\n* Carmo\n* Cordeiro\n* Macuco\n |\n| Nova Friburgo | * Bom Jardim\n* Duas Barras\n* Nova Friburgo\n* Sumidouro\n |\n| Santa Maria Madalena | * Santa Maria Madalena\n* São Sebastião do Alto\n* Trajano de Morais\n |\n| Três Rios | * Areal\n* Comendador Levy Gasparian\n* Paraíba do Sul\n* Sapucaia\n* Três Rios\n |\n\n |\n| Mesoregion  Metropolitana do  Rio de Janeiro | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe city has parks and ecological reserves such as the Tijuca National Park, the world's first urban forest and UNESCO Environmental Heritage and Biosphere Reserve; Pedra Branca State Park, which houses the highest point of Rio de Janeiro, the peak of Pedra Branca; the Quinta da Boa Vista complex; the Botanical Garden;[41] Rio's Zoo; Parque Lage; and the Passeio Público, the first public park in the Americas.[42] In addition the Flamengo Park is the largest landfill in the city, extending from the center to the south zone, and containing museums and monuments, in addition to much vegetation.\n\n\nSince 1961, the Tijuca National Park (Parque Nacional da Tijuca), the largest city-surrounded urban forest and the second largest urban forest in the world, has been a National Park.

There are also a small number of schools under federal administration, as is the case of Pedro II School, Colégio de Aplicação da UFRJ and the Centro Federal de Educação Tecnológica of Rio de Janeiro (CEFET-RJ). In addition, Rio has an ample offering of private schools that provide education at all levels. Rio is home to many colleges and universities. The literacy rate for cariocas aged 10 and older is nearly 95 percent, well above the national average.[106] In Rio, there were 1,033 primary schools with 25,594 teachers and 667,788 students in 1995. There are 370 secondary schools with 9,699 teachers and 227,892 students. There are 53 University-preparatory schools with 14,864 teachers and 154,447 students.

The Guanabara Palace (formerly known as Paço Isabel) is located in the Laranjeiras neighborhood, in the south zone, and is the official seat of the Rio de Janeiro executive power. Not to be confused with Palácio Laranjeiras, situated in the same neighborhood, which is the official residence of the governor of Rio de Janeiro.[118]\n\n\nThe Legislative Assembly of Rio de Janeiro (ALERJ) is the state legislative body[119] and is headquartered at Tiradentes Palace,[120] where the Chamber of Deputies of Brazil previously functioned.[121]\n\n\nThe Court of Justice of the State of Rio de Janeiro (TJRJ) is the highest body of the judiciary in the state. Its central court is located in downtown Rio de Janeiro, but, from 2013 to July 2018, some of the courts of this court were moved to Cidade Nova.[122]\n\n\n\n### Federal government[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the late 17th century, still during the Sugar Era, the Bandeirantes discovered gold and diamonds in the neighboring captaincy of Minas Gerais, thus Rio de Janeiro became a much more practical port for exporting wealth (gold, precious stones, besides the sugar) than Salvador, Bahia, much farther northeast. On 27 January 1763,[19] the colonial administration in Portuguese America was moved from Salvador to Rio de Janeiro. The city remained primarily a colonial capital until 1808, when the Portuguese royal family and most of the associated Lisbon nobles, fleeing from Napoleon's invasion of Portugal, moved to Rio de Janeiro.\n\n\n\n### Portuguese court[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Center for Human Science of the Federal University of the State of Rio de Janeiro\nThe Portuguese language is the official and national language, and thus the primary language taught in schools.

The Ministry of Education has certified approximately 99 upper-learning institutions in Rio.[100] The most prestigious university is the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.

Since August 2004, with the transfer of many flights from Santos-Dumont Airport, Rio de Janeiro International Airport has returned to being the main doorway to the city. Besides linking Rio to the rest of Brazil with domestic flights, Galeão has connections to 19 countries. It has a capacity to handle up to 30 million users a year in two passenger terminals. It is located 20 km (12 mi) from downtown Rio. The airport complex also has Brazil's longest runway at 4,000 m (13,123.36 ft), and one of South America's largest cargo logistics terminals. The airport is connected to the express bus service.[200]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Santos Dumont Airport: used mainly by the services to São Paulo, some short and medium-haul domestic flights, and general aviation. Located on Guanabara Bay just a few blocks from the heart of downtown Rio, during the 1990s Santos-Dumont began to outgrow its capacity, besides diverging from its specialization on short-hop flights, offering routes to other destinations in Brazil. For this reason, in late 2004 Santos-Dumont returned to its original condition of operating only shuttle flights to and from Congonhas Airport in São Paulo, along with regional aviation. The passenger terminal has undergone extensive renovation and expansion, which increased its capacity to 9,9 million users a year. The airport is connected to the city light rail system (Rio de Janeiro Light Rail), which connects several transport systems to downtown.[201]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Biblioteca Nacional (National Library of Brazil) ranks as one of the largest libraries in the world.

As with many of Rio de Janeiro's cultural monuments, the library was originally off-limits to the general public. The most valuable collections in the library include: 4,300 items donated by Barbosa Machado including a precious collection of rare brochures detailing the History of Portugal and Brazil; 2,365 items from the 17th and 18th centuries that were previously owned by Antônio de Araújo de Azevedo, the \"Count of Barca\", including the 125-volume set of prints \"Le Grand Théâtre de l'Univers;\" a collection of documents regarding the Jesuítica Province of Paraguay and the \"Region of Prata;\" and the Teresa Cristina Maria Collection, donated by Emperor Pedro II.

The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of São Sebastião do Rio de Janeiro is the second largest archdiocese in Brazil after São Paulo.[95] The Rio de Janeiro Cathedral was inaugurated in 1979, in the central region of the city. Its installations have a collection of great historical and religious value: the Archdiocesan Museum of Sacred Art and the Archdiocesan Archive.[96] In a Contemporary architecture, it has a conical shape, with 96 meters of internal diameter and capacity to receive up to 20 thousand faithful. The splendor of the building, with straight and sober lines, is due to the changing stained glass windows carved on the walls up to the dome. Its design and execution was coordinated by Monsignor Ivo Antônio Calliari (1918–2005).[96] Saint Sebastian is recognized as the city's patron saint, which is why it received the canonical name of \"Saint Sebastian of Rio de Janeiro.\"[97]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n195. **^** Flickr roger4336. \"Rio de Janeiro\". *TouristLink*.

While the city had in past had a thriving tourism sector, the industry entered a decline in the last quarter of the 20th century. Annual international airport arrivals dropped from 621,000 to 378,000 and average hotel occupancy dropped to 50% between 1985 and 1993.[195] The fact that Brasília replaced Rio de Janeiro as the Brazilian capital in 1960 and that São Paulo replaced Rio as the country's commercial, financial and main cultural center during the mid-20th century, has also been cited as a leading cause of the decline.[196]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n\n\n\nRio de Janeiro city (1890)\n| Group | Population | Percentage[88] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Portuguese immigrants | 106,461 | 20.4%\n |\n| Brazilians with at least one Portuguese parent | 161,203 | 30.8%\n |\n| Portuguese immigrants and their descendants | 267,664 | 51.2%\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe population of the city of Rio de Janeiro, occupying an area of 1,182.3 km2 (456.5 sq mi),[39] is about 6,000,000.[40] The population of the greater metropolitan area is estimated at 11–13.5 million.

Its securities market, although declining in significance relative to São Paulo, is still of major importance. Recent decades have seen a sharp transformation in its economic profile, which is becoming more and more one of a major national hub of services and businesses.[183] The city is the headquarters of large telecom companies, such as Intelig, Oi and Embratel. Major Brazilian entertainment and media organizations are based in Rio de Janeiro like Organizações Globo and also some of Brazil's major newspapers: *Jornal do Brasil*, *O Dia*, and *Business Rio*.\n\n\nTourism and entertainment are other key aspects of the city's economic life.

Industrial enterprises are being built in lower and lower middle class residential Santa Cruz, one of the largest and most populous of Rio de Janeiro's neighborhoods, most notably Ternium Brasil, a new steel mill with its own private docks on Sepetiba Bay, which is planned to be South America's largest steel works.[135] A tunnel called *Túnel da Grota Funda*, opened in 2012, creating a public transit facility between Barra da Tijuca and Santa Cruz, lessening travel time to the region from other areas of Rio de Janeiro.[136]\n\n\n\n## International relations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of twin towns and sister cities in Brazil\n\n### Twin towns – sister cities[edit]\n\n\nRio de Janeiro is twinned with:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Portuguese cultural influence is still seen in many parts of the city (and many other parts of the state of Rio de Janeiro), including architecture and language. Most Brazilians with some cultural contact with Rio know how to easily differentiate between the local dialect, *fluminense*, and other Brazilian dialects. People of Portuguese ancestry predominate in most of the state. The Brazilian census of 1920 showed that 39.7% of the Portuguese who lived in Brazil lived in Rio de Janeiro. Including all of the Rio de Janeiro, the proportion raised to 46.3% of the Portuguese who lived in Brazil. The numerical presence of the Portuguese was extremely high, accounting for 72% of the foreigners who lived in the capital. Portuguese born people accounted for 20.4% of the population of Rio, and those with a Portuguese father or a Portuguese mother accounted for 30.8%. In other words, native born Portuguese and their children accounted for 51.2% of the inhabitants of Rio, or a total of 267,664 people in 1890.[87]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTo attract industry, the state government has designated certain areas on the outskirts of the city as industrial districts where infrastructure is provided and land sales are made under special conditions. Oil and natural gas from fields off the northern coast of Rio de Janeiro state are a major asset used for developing manufacturing activities in Rio's metropolitan area, enabling it to compete with other major cities for new investment in industry.[185]\n\n\nOwing to the proximity of Rio's port facilities, many of Brazil's export-import companies are headquartered in the city. In Greater Rio, which has one of the highest per capita incomes in Brazil, retail trade is substantial. Many of the most important retail stores are located in the center, but others are scattered throughout the commercial areas of the other districts, where shopping centers, supermarkets, and other retail businesses handle a large volume of consumer trade.[186]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nRio de Janeiro is one of the most visited cities in the Southern Hemisphere and is known for its natural settings, carnival, samba, bossa nova, and balneario beaches[12] such as Barra da Tijuca, Copacabana, Ipanema, and Leblon. In addition to the beaches, some of the most famous landmarks include the giant statue of *Christ the Redeemer* atop Corcovado mountain, named one of the New Seven Wonders of the World; Sugarloaf Mountain with its cable car; the *Sambódromo* (Sambadrome), a permanent grandstand-lined parade avenue which is used during Carnival; and Maracanã Stadium, one of the world's largest football stadiums. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs a result of the influx of immigrants to Brazil from the late 19th to the early 20th century, also found in Rio de Janeiro and its metropolitan area are communities of Levantine Arabs who are mostly Christian or Irreligious, Spaniards, Italians, Germans, Japanese,[89] Jews, and people from other parts of Brazil. The main waves of internal migration came from people of African, mixed or older Portuguese (as descendants of early settlers) descent from Minas Gerais and people of Eastern European, Swiss, Italian, German, Portuguese and older Portuguese-Brazilian heritage from Espírito Santo in the early and mid-20th century, together with people with origins in Northeastern Brazil, in the mid-to-late and late 20th century, as well some in the early 21st century (the latter more directed to peripheries than the city's core).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDespite the change in the federal capital, 59% of civil servants in the Executive Branch of federal agencies and public companies remained in the city. Rio de Janeiro is also the only Brazilian state where the number of federal employees exceeds the number of state employees. About a third of all federal public bodies and companies remain in the former capital, with 50 public offices, including agencies, autarchies, foundations and public companies, such as the National Library, the National Nuclear Energy Commission, Fiocruz, BNDES, Petrobras, Eletrobras, IBGE, Casa da Moeda, the National Archives, among others.[123]\n\n\n\n### Subdivisions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Municipality of Rio de Janeiro and its division into zones and neighborhoods \n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| West Zone\n | North Zone\n | South Zone\n | Central Zone\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe off-shore oil exploration in the Campos Basin began in 1968 and became the main site for oil production of Brazil. This caused many oil and gas companies to be based in Rio de Janeiro, such as the Brazilian branches of Shell, EBX and Esso. For many years Rio was the second largest industrial hub of Brazil,[182] with oil refineries, shipbuilding industries, steel, metallurgy, petrochemicals, cement, pharmaceutical, textile, processed foods and furniture industries.\n\n\nMajor international pharmaceutical companies have their Brazilian headquarters in Rio such as: Merck, Roche, Arrow, Darrow, Baxter, Mayne, and Mappel. A newer electronics and computer sector has been added to the more-established industries. Construction, also an important activity, provides a significant source of employment for large numbers of unskilled workers and is buoyed by the number of seasonal residents who build second homes in the Greater Rio de Janeiro area.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMany Protestant creeds coexist in the city, Presbyterian, Congregational, Lutheran and Anglican Churches. In addition to evangelical churches such as the Baptist, Methodist, Seventh-day Adventist and Pentecostal churches, such as the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, Assembly of God, Christian Congregation in Brazil and The Foursquare Church.[94]\n\n\nAfro-Brazilian religions such as Umbanda and Candomblé find support in various social segments, although professed by less than 2% of the population, many Cariocas simultaneously observe those practices with Roman Catholicism.[94][98]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Rio de Janeiro schools, colleges, universities and research centers\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  • Metro density | 2,705.1/km2 (7,006/sq mi) |\n| Demonym | Carioca |\n| Time zone | UTC−3 (BRT) |\n| Postal Code | 20000-001 to 23799-999\n |\n| Area code | 21 |\n| **HDI** (2010) | 0.799 – high[3] |\n| Nominal 2018 | US$ 93.9 billion (2nd)[4] |\n| Per capita | US$14,046 (2nd) |\n| Website | prefeitura.rio |\n|  |\n| UNESCO World Heritage Site\n |\n| Official name | Rio de Janeiro: Carioca Landscapes between the Mountain and the Sea |\n| Type | Cultural |\n| Criteria | vi |\n| Designated | 2012 (36th session) |\n| Reference no. | 1100 |\n|  |\n|  |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n82. **^** Parra, FC; Amado, RC; Lambertucci, JR; Rocha, J; Antunes, CM; Pena, SD (January 2003). \"Color and genomic ancestry in Brazilians\". *Proc.

Rio de Janeiro became an attractive place for companies to locate when it was the capital of Brazil, as important sectors of society and of the government were present in the city, even when their factories were located in other cities or states. The city was chosen as headquarters for state-owned companies such as Petrobras, Eletrobras, Caixa Econômica Federal, National Economic and Social Development Bank and Vale (which was privatized in the 1990s). The Rio de Janeiro Stock Exchange (BVRJ), which currently trades only government securities, was the first stock exchange founded in Brazil in 1845. Despite the transfer of the capital to Brasília in 1960, many of these headquarters remained within the Rio metropolitan area.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSubprefectures are officially grouped into four regions (or \"zones\"), taking into account geographic position and occupation history; however these do not have any administrative or political power over the municipality. The official political division of the municipality takes into account historical-cultural characteristics to divide the neighborhoods.[125] Most of its population is concentrated in the neighborhoods of Campo Grande, Santa Cruz, Bangu, Tijuca, Realengo, Jacarepaguá, Copacabana, Barra da Tijuca, Maré, Guaratiba and Taquara together, these eleven neighborhoods concentrate a population of 1.5 million inhabitants, according to the 2010 census.[126]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Maracanã Stadium\n![](image)Nilton Santos Olympic Stadium\nAs in the rest of Brazil, association football is the most popular sport. The city's major teams are Flamengo, Vasco da Gama, Fluminense and Botafogo. Madureira, Bangu, Portuguesa, America and Bonsucesso are small clubs. Famous players born in the city include Zico, Romário and Ronaldo.[254] Rio de Janeiro was one of the host cities of the 1950 and 2014 FIFA World Cups, for which on both occasions Brazil was the host nation. In 1950, the Maracanã Stadium hosted 8 matches, including all but one of the host team's matches. The Maracanã was also the location of the infamous tournament-deciding match between Uruguay and Brazil, where Brazil only needed a draw to win the final group stage and the whole tournament. Brazil ended up losing 2–1 in front of a home crowd of more than 199,000. In 2014, the Maracanã hosted seven matches, including the final, where Germany beat Argentina 1–0.[255]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n113. **^** Marly Silva da Motta (2001). \"O lugar da cidade do Rio de Janeiro na Federação brasileira:uma questão em três momentos\" (PDF) (in Brazilian Portuguese).

As there was no physical space or urban structure to accommodate hundreds of noblemen who arrived suddenly, many inhabitants were simply evicted from their homes.[21] In the first decade, several educational establishments were created, such as the Military Academy, the Royal School of Sciences, Arts and Crafts and the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts, as well as the National Library of Brazil – with the largest collection in Latin America[22] – and The Botanical Garden. The first printed newspaper in Brazil, the *Gazeta do Rio de Janeiro*, came into circulation during this period.[23] When Brazil was elevated to Kingdom in 1815, it became the capital of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves until the return of the Portuguese Royal Family to Lisbon in 1821, but remained as capital of the Kingdom of Brazil.[24]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n13. **^** \"BBC Sport, Rio to stage 2016 Olympic Games\". *BBC News*. 2 October 2009.

Its architecture embraces churches and buildings dating from the 16th to the 19th centuries, blending with the world-renowned designs of the 20th century. Rio was home to the Portuguese Imperial family and capital of the country for many years, and was influenced by Portuguese, English, and French architecture.[233]\n\n\nRio de Janeiro has inherited a strong cultural role from the past. In the late 19th century, there were sessions held of the first Brazilian film and since then, several production cycles have spread out, eventually placing Rio at the forefront of experimental and national cinema. The Rio de Janeiro International Film Festival[234] has been held annually since 1999.[235]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Santa Cruz Air Force Base\n* Santos Dumont Airport\n* Rio de Janeiro/Galeão International Airport\n* Jacarepaguá Airport\n |\n| Related | * Category:People from Rio de Janeiro (city)\n* Carioca\n* Demographics of Rio de Janeiro\n* Municipal Chamber of Rio de Janeiro\n* Project Morrinho\n* Category:Sport in Rio de Janeiro (city)\n |\n| * ![](image) Rio de Janeiro\n* ![](image) Category\n* ![](image) Outline\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![](image) Municipalities of Rio de Janeiro\n |\n| --- |\n| Capital: **Rio de Janeiro**\n |\n| Mesoregion  Baixadas | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Bacia de São João | * Casimiro de Abreu\n* Rio das Ostras\n* Silva Jardim\n |\n| Lagos | * Araruama\n* Armação dos Búzios\n* Arraial do Cabo\n* Cabo Frio\n* Iguaba Grande\n* São Pedro da Aldeia\n* Saquarema\n |\n\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Mesoregion  Centro Fluminense | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn Rio de Janeiro, the executive power is represented by the mayor and the cabinet of secretaries, in accordance with the model proposed by the Federal Constitution. The Organic Law of the Municipality and the current Master Plan, however, stipulate that the public administration must provide the population with effective tools for the exercise of participatory democracy. In this way, the city is divided into subprefectures, each of which is headed by a sub-mandatory appointed directly by the mayor.[113]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Portuguese immigrant in Rio de Janeiro, considered the largest \"Portuguese city\" outside Portugal[86]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe black community was formed by residents whose ancestors had been brought as slaves, mostly from Angola and Mozambique, as well by people of Angolan, Mozambican and West African descent who moved to Rio from other parts of Brazil. The samba (from Bahia with Angolan influence) and the famous local version of the carnival (from Europe) first appeared under the influence of the black community in the city. Today, nearly half of the city's population is by phenotype perceptibly black or part black.[81] A large majority has some recent sub-Saharan ancestor. White in Brazil is defined more by having a European-looking phenotype rather than ancestry, and two full siblings can be of different \"racial\" categories[82] in a skin color and phenotype continuum from *pálido* (*branco*) or fair-skinned, through *branco moreno* or swarthy Caucasian, *mestiço claro* or lighter skinned multiracial, *pardo* (mixed race) to *negro* or black. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn Brazil, most interstate transportation is done by road. A large terminal for long-distance buses is in the Santo Cristo neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro. There are also two port facilities for cargo and passenger ships (Rio de Janeiro and Sepetiba port). Rio has roads to all neighbor States. Some roads (like Via Dutra, to São Paulo, and a stretch of the BR-101 which covers the Rio-Niterói bridge) were chartered to private enterprises. The quality of the highways improved much, but was accompanied by a significant increase of the toll fees. From São Paulo: take the BR-116 (Presidente Dutra Federal Highway) or the BR-101 (Rio-Santos Federal Highway). From Belo Horizonte: BR-040. From Salvador: BR-101 or BR-324/BR-116/BR-393/BR-040.\n\n\n\n### Bicycles[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs a political center of the country, Rio concentrated the political-partisan life of the Empire. It was the main stage of the abolitionist and republican movements in the last half of the 19th century.[24] At that time the number of slaves was drastically reduced and the city was developed, with modern drains, animal trams, train stations crossing the city, gas and electric lighting, telephone and telegraph wiring, water and river plumbing.[24] Rio continued as the capital of Brazil after 1889, when the monarchy was replaced by a republic.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n123. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Por que o Rio deveria virar um segundo Distrito Federal, segundo este pesquisador\". *Nexo Jornal*.

The city is served by a number of expressways, like Linha Vermelha, Linha Amarela, Avenida Brasil, Avenida das Américas and Avenida Infante Dom Henrique (Aterro do Flamengo); in spite of this, traffic jams are very common.[229] Because of the organization of the 2016 Olympics the city is installing four BRT systems to link Barra da Tijuca with other major neighborhoods: TransOlimpica (between Barra and Deodoro); TransBrasil (over the Avenida Brasil expressway); TransCarioca (between Barra and the Galeão International Airport); and TransOeste (between Barra and Santa Cruz, over Avenida das Américas).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFrom the colonial period until the first independent era, Rio de Janeiro was a city of slaves. There was a large influx of African slaves to Rio de Janeiro: in 1819, there were 145,000 slaves in the captaincy. In 1840, the number of slaves reached 220,000 people.[25] Between 1811 and 1831, 500,000 to a million slaves arrived in Rio de Janeiro through Valongo Wharf, which is now a World Heritage Site.[26] The Port of Rio de Janeiro was the largest port of slaves in America.[27]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nBotafogo Bay in 1869\n![](image)\nBotafogo Bay in 1889\n\n### Empire[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Jacarepaguá-Roberto Marinho Airport: used by general aviation and home to the Aeroclube do Brasil (Brasil Flying club).

Formerly called Bartolomeu de Gusmão Airport, it was built by the Luftschiffbau Zeppelin.

It is also the location of the University of the Air Force (Universidade da Força Aérea),[203] the Museu Aeroespacial,[204] and where air shows take place.\n\n\n### Ports[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFounded in 1565 by the Portuguese, the city was initially the seat of the Captaincy of Rio de Janeiro, a domain of the Portuguese Empire. In 1763, it became the capital of the State of Brazil, a state of the Portuguese Empire. In 1808, when the Portuguese Royal Court moved to Brazil, Rio de Janeiro became the seat of the court of Queen Maria I of Portugal. She subsequently, under the leadership of her son the prince regent John VI of Portugal, raised Brazil to the dignity of a kingdom, within the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and Algarves. Rio remained as the capital of the pluricontinental monarchy until 1822, when the Brazilian War of Independence began. This is one of the few instances in history that the capital of a colonizing country officially shifted to a city in one of its colonies. Rio de Janeiro subsequently served as the capital of the independent monarchy, the Empire of Brazil, until 1889, and then the capital of a republican Brazil until 1960 when the capital was transferred to Brasília.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n48. **^** \"For rowers in Rio's Olympic water, it's all about avoiding the splash\". *Chicago Tribune*.

On 21 April of that year, the capital of Brazil was officially moved to Brasília. The territory of the former Federal District became its own state, Guanabara, after the bay that borders it to the east, encompassing just the city of Rio de Janeiro. After the 1964 coup d'état that installed a military dictatorship, the city-state was the only state left in Brazil to oppose the military. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe city is commonly divided into the historic center (Centro); the tourist-friendly wealthier South Zone (Zona Sul); the residential less wealthy North Zone (Zona Norte); peripheries in the West Zone (Zona Oeste), among them Santa Cruz, Campo Grande and the wealthy newer Barra da Tijuca district.

These people, mostly descendants of slaves, then moved to live in the city's hills, creating the first favelas.[30] Inspired by the city of Paris, Passos built the Municipal Theatre, the National Museum of Fine Arts and the National Library in the city's center; brought electric power to Rio and created larger avenues to adapt the city to automobiles.[31] Passos also named Oswaldo Cruz as Director General of Public Health.

On 27 January 1763,[19] the colonial administration in Portuguese America was moved from Salvador to Rio de Janeiro.

Since August 2004, with the transfer of many flights from Santos-Dumont Airport, Rio de Janeiro International Airport has returned to being the main doorway to the city. Besides linking Rio to the rest of Brazil with domestic flights, Galeão has connections to 19 countries. It has a capacity to handle up to 30 million users a year in two passenger terminals. It is located 20 km (12 mi) from downtown Rio. The airport complex also has Brazil's longest runway at 4,000 m (13,123.36 ft), and one of South America's largest cargo logistics terminals. The airport is connected to the express bus service.[200]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Santos Dumont Airport: used mainly by the services to São Paulo, some short and medium-haul domestic flights, and general aviation. Located on Guanabara Bay just a few blocks from the heart of downtown Rio, during the 1990s Santos-Dumont began to outgrow its capacity, besides diverging from its specialization on short-hop flights, offering routes to other destinations in Brazil. For this reason, in late 2004 Santos-Dumont returned to its original condition of operating only shuttle flights to and from Congonhas Airport in São Paulo, along with regional aviation. The passenger terminal has undergone extensive renovation and expansion, which increased its capacity to 9,9 million users a year. The airport is connected to the city light rail system (Rio de Janeiro Light Rail), which connects several transport systems to downtown.[201]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Biblioteca Nacional (National Library of Brazil) ranks as one of the largest libraries in the world. It is also the largest library in all of Latin America.[241] Located in Cinelândia, the National Library was originally created by the King of Portugal, in 1810. As with many of Rio de Janeiro's cultural monuments, the library was originally off-limits to the general public. The most valuable collections in the library include: 4,300 items donated by Barbosa Machado including a precious collection of rare brochures detailing the History of Portugal and Brazil; 2,365 items from the 17th and 18th centuries that were previously owned by Antônio de Araújo de Azevedo, the \"Count of Barca\", including the 125-volume set of prints \"Le Grand Théâtre de l'Univers;\" a collection of documents regarding the Jesuítica Province of Paraguay and the \"Region of Prata;\" and the Teresa Cristina Maria Collection, donated by Emperor Pedro II. The collection contains 48,236 items. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n200. **^** \"International Airport of Rio de Janeiro\". Infraero. Archived from the original on 23 April 2008.

The Brazilian drought of 2014–2015, most severe in the Southeast Region and the worst in decades, affected the entire metropolitan region's water supply (a diversion from the Paraíba do Sul River to the Guandu River is a major source for the state's most populous mesoregion). There were plans to divert the Paraíba do Sul to the Sistema Cantareira (Cantareira system) during the water crisis of 2014 in order to help the critically drought-stricken Greater São Paulo area. However, availability of sufficient rainfall to supply tap water to both metropolitan areas in the future is merely speculative.[54][55][56]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSome of the best artists in the history of Brazilian popular music hail from Rio de Janeiro, including aforementioned Lobão, Tim Maia, Agepê, Emílio Santiago, Evandro Mesquita, Byafra, Erasmo Carlos, Elymar Santos, Kátia Cega, Ivan Lins, Marcos Valle, Jorge Ben Jor e Wilson Simonal.\n\n\n\nFurther information on the pop band: R2D3\n\n### Theater[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nRoughly in the same suburbs (Nova Iguaçu and surrounding areas, including parts of Campo Grande and Bangu) that correspond to the location of the March 2012, February–March 2013 and January 2015 pseudo-hail (*granizo*) falls, there was a tornado-like phenomenon in January 2011, for the first time in the region's recorded history, causing structural damage and long-lasting blackouts, but no fatalities.[57][58] The World Meteorological Organization has advised that Brazil, especially its southeastern region, must be prepared for increasingly severe weather occurrences in the near future, since events such as the catastrophic January 2011 Rio de Janeiro floods and mudslides are not an isolated phenomenon. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)*Christ the Redeemer*\nRio de Janeiro has had a rich and influential Catholic tradition. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of São Sebastião do Rio de Janeiro is the second largest archdiocese in Brazil after São Paulo.[95] The Rio de Janeiro Cathedral was inaugurated in 1979, in the central region of the city. Its installations have a collection of great historical and religious value: the Archdiocesan Museum of Sacred Art and the Archdiocesan Archive.[96] In a Contemporary architecture, it has a conical shape, with 96 meters of internal diameter and capacity to receive up to 20 thousand faithful. The splendor of the building, with straight and sober lines, is due to the changing stained glass windows carved on the walls up to the dome. Its design and execution was coordinated by Monsignor Ivo Antônio Calliari (1918–2005).[96] Saint Sebastian is recognized as the city's patron saint, which is why it received the canonical name of \"Saint Sebastian of Rio de Janeiro.\"[97]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n195. **^** Flickr roger4336. \"Rio de Janeiro\". *TouristLink*.

The city is located high in the Brazilian highlands in the country's Central-West region. It was founded by President Juscelino Kubitschek on 21 April 1960, to serve as the new national capital. Brasília is estimated to be Brazil's third-most populous city after São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.[1] Among major Latin American cities, it has the highest GDP per capita.[6]\n\n\nBrasília was a planned city developed by Lúcio Costa, Oscar Niemeyer and Joaquim Cardozo in 1956 in a scheme to move the capital from Rio de Janeiro to a more central location. The landscape architect was Roberto Burle Marx.[7][8] The city's design divides it into numbered blocks as well as sectors for specified activities, such as the Hotel Sector, the Banking Sector, and the Embassy Sector. Brasília was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987 due to its modernist architecture and uniquely artistic urban planning.[9] It was named \"City of Design\" by UNESCO in October 2017 and has been part of the Creative Cities Network since then.[10]\n\n\nBrasília is a planned city distinguished by its white, modern architecture, designed by Oscar Niemeyer. All three branches of Brazil's federal government are centered in the city: executive, legislative and judiciary. Brasília also hosts 124 foreign embassies.[11] The city's international airport connects it to all other major Brazilian cities and some international destinations, and it is the third-busiest airport in Brazil. It was one of the main host cities of the 2014 FIFA World Cup and hosted some of the football matches during the 2016 Summer Olympics; it also hosted the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup.\n\n\nLaid out in the shape of an airplane, its \"fuselage\" is the Monumental Axis, a pair of wide avenue flanking a large park. In the \"cockpit\" is Praça dos Três Poderes, named for the 3 branches of government surrounding it. Brasília has a unique legal status, as it is an administrative region rather than a municipality like other cities in Brazil. The name \"Brasília\" is often used as a synonym for the Federal District as a whole, which is divided into 33 administrative regions, one of which (Plano Piloto) includes the area of the originally planned city and its federal government buildings. The rest of the Federal District plus Plano Piloto are considered by IBGE to make up Brasília's city area.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: History of Brasília; Timeline of Brasília; History of Brazil; Planaltina, Federal District; Juscelino Kubitschek; Lúcio Costa; Oscar Niemeyer; Joaquim Cardozo; and Burle Marx\n\n### Background[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The foundation stone of Brasilia, Centennial Hill, erected in 1922 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Brazil's independence\nBrazil's first capital was Salvador; in 1763 Rio de Janeiro became Brazil's capital and remained so until 1960. During this period, resources tended to be centered in Brazil's southeastern region, and most of the country's population was concentrated near its Atlantic coast.[12] Brasilia's geographically central location fostered a more regionally neutral federal capital. An article of the country's first republican constitution, dated 1891, states that the capital should be moved from Rio de Janeiro to a place close to the country's center.\n\n\nThe plan was conceived in 1827 by José Bonifácio, an advisor to Emperor Pedro I. He presented a plan to the General Assembly of Brazil for a new city called Brasilia, with the idea of moving the capital westward from the heavily populated southeastern corridor. The bill was not enacted because Pedro I dissolved the Assembly.\n\n\nAccording to the legend, Italian saint Don Bosco in 1883 had a dream in which he described a futuristic city that roughly fitted Brasilia's location.[13] In Brasilia today, many references to Bosco, who founded the Salesian order, are found throughout the city and one church parish in the city bears his name.[14]\n\n\n\n### Costa plan[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Urban planner Lúcio Costa was the winner of the competition for the construction project of Brasília and played a key role in the city's landmarking.\n![](image)Plano Piloto\nJuscelino Kubitschek was elected President of Brazil in 1955. Upon taking office in January 1956, in fulfilment of his campaign pledge, he initiated the planning and construction of the new capital. The following year an international jury selected Lúcio Costa's plan to guide the construction of Brazil's new capital, Brasilia. Costa was a student of the famous modernist architect Le Corbusier, and some of modernism's architecture features can be found in his plan. Costa's plan was not as detailed as some of the plans presented by other architects and city planners. It did not include land use schedules, models, population charts or mechanical drawings; however, it was chosen by five out of six jurors because it had the features required to align the growth of a capital city.[15] Even though the initial plan was transformed over time, it oriented much of the construction and most of its features survived.\n\n\nBrasilia's accession as the new capital and its designation for the development of an extensive interior region inspired the symbolism of the plan. Costa used a cross-axial design indicating the possession and conquest of this new place with a cross,[16] often likened to a dragonfly, an airplane or a bird.[15] Costa's plan included two principal components, the Monumental Axis (east to west) and the Residential Axis (north to south). The Monumental Axis was assigned political and administrative activities, and is considered the body of the city with the style and simplicity of its buildings, oversized scales, and broad vistas and heights, producing the idea of Monumentality. This axis includes the various ministries, national congress, presidential palace, supreme court building and the television and radio tower.[16] The Residential Axis was intended to contain areas with intimate character and is considered the most important achievement of the plan; it was designed for housing and associated functions such as local commerce, schooling, recreation and churches, constituted of 96 superblocks [pt] limited to six-story buildings and 12 additional superblocks limited to three-story buildings;[15] Costa's intention with superblocks was to have small self-contained and self-sufficient neighborhoods and uniform buildings with apartments of two or three different categories, where he envisioned the integration of upper and middle classes sharing the same residential area.[16]\n\n\nThe urban design of the communal apartment blocks was based on Le Corbusier's Ville Radieuse of 1935, and the superblocks on the North American Radburn layout from 1929.[17] Visually, the blocks were intended to appear absorbed by the landscape because they were isolated by a belt of tall trees and lower vegetation. Costa attempted to introduce a Brazil that was more equitable, he also designed housing for the working classes that was separated from the upper- and middle-class housing and was visually different, with the intention of avoiding slums (*favelas*) in the urban periphery.[15][18] The *superquadra* has been accused of being a space where individuals are oppressed and alienated to a form of spatial segregation.[19]\n\n\nOne of the main objectives of the plan was to allow the free flow of automobile traffic, the plan included lanes of traffic in a north–south direction (seven for each direction) for the Monumental Axis and three arterials (the W3, the Eixo and the L2) for the residential Axis;[16] the cul-de-sac access roads of the superblocks were planned to be the end of the main flow of traffic. And the reason behind the heavy emphasis on automobile traffic is the architect's desire to establish the concept of modernity in every level.\n\n\n\n![](image)Brasília in 1958. Only Asa Sul is already leased, and Ministries Esplanade is also visible.\n![](image)Construction of the Ministries Esplanade in 1959\n![](image)Brasilia in 1964\nThough automobiles were invented prior to the 20th century, mass production of vehicles in the early 20th made them widely available; thus, they became a symbol of modernity. The two small axes around the Monumental axis provide loops and exits for cars to enter small roads. Some argue that his emphasis of the plan on automobiles caused the lengthening of distances between centers and it attended only the necessities of a small segment of the population who owned cars.[15] But one can not ignore the bus transportation system in the city. The buses routes inside the city operate heavily on W3 and L2. Almost anywhere, including satellite cities, can be reached just by taking the bus and most of the Plano Piloto can be reached without transferring to other buses.\n\n\nLater, as the population of the city increased, the transportation system also played an important role in mediating the relationship between the Pilot plan and the satellite cities. Due to the larger influx of vehicles, traffic lights were introduced to the Momument Axis, which violates the concept of modernity and advancement the architect first employed. Additionally, the metro system in Brasilia was mainly built for inhabitants of satellite cities. Though this growth has made Brasilia no longer a pure utopia with incomparable modernity, the later development of traffic management, bus routes to satellite cities, and the metro system all serve as a remedy to the dystopia, enabling the citizens to enjoy the kind of modernity that was not carefully planned.\n\n\nAt the intersection of the Monumental and Residential Axis Costa planned the city center with the transportation center (Rodoviaria), the banking sector and the hotel sector,[16] near to the city center, he proposed an amusement center with theaters, cinemas and restaurants. Costa's Plan is seen as a plan with a sectoral tendency, segregating all the banks, the office buildings, and the amusement center.[15]\n\n\nOne of the main features of Costa's plan was that he presented a new city with its future shape and patterns evident from the beginning. This meant that the original plan included paving streets that were not immediately put into use; the advantage of this was that the original plan is hard to undo because he provided for an entire street network, but on the other hand, is difficult to adapt and mold to other circumstances in the future.[15] In addition, there has been controversy with the monumental aspect of Lúcio Costa's Plan, because it appeared to some as 19th century city planning, not modern 20th century in urbanism.[20]\n\n\nAn interesting analysis can be made of Brasilia within the context of Cold War politics and the association of Lúcio Costa's plan to the symbolism of aviation. From an architectural perspective, the airplane-shaped plan was certainly an homage to Le Corbusier and his enchantment with the aircraft as an architectural masterpiece. However, Brasilia was constructed soon after the end of World War II. Despite Brazil's minor participation in the conflict, the airplane shape of the city was key in envisioning the country as part of the newly globalized world, together with the victorious Allies.[21] Furthermore, Brasilia is a unique example of modernism both as a guideline for architectural design but also as a principle for organizing society. Modernism in Brasilia is explored in James Holston's book, *The Modernist City*.[22]\n\n\n\n### Construction[edit]\n\n\nJuscelino Kubitschek, president of Brazil from 1956 to 1961, ordered Brasilia's construction, fulfilling the promise of the Constitution and his own political campaign promise. Building Brasilia was part of Juscelino's \"fifty years of prosperity in five\" plan. Already in 1892, the astronomer Louis Cruls, in the service of the Brazilian government, had investigated the site for the future capital. Lúcio Costa won a contest and was the main urban planner[23] in 1957, with 5550 people competing. Oscar Niemeyer was the chief architect of most public buildings, Joaquim Cardozo was the structural engineer, and Roberto Burle Marx was the landscape designer. Brasilia was built in 41 months, from 1956 to 21 April 1960, when it was officially inaugurated.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nAerial view of downtown Brasília (Pilot Plan) along the Monumental Axis, especially the new Mane Garrincha Stadium (left), the National Congress and the Three Powers Plaza (right). The entire residential area of North Wing (*Asa Norte*) is seen in the middle of the image.\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Brasilia from Hodoyoshi 1 satellite\n![](image)Map from OpenStreetMap, covering the Plano Piloto area of Brasília\nThe city sits at an elevation of 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) and more, high on the Brazilian Highlands in the country's center-western region. Paranoá Lake, a large artificial lake, was built to increase the amount of water available and to maintain the region's humidity. It has a marina, and hosts wakeboarders and windsurfers. Diving can also be practiced and one of the main attractions is Vila Amaury, an old village submerged in the lake. This is where the first construction workers of Brasilia used to live.[24]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nBrasilia has a tropical savanna climate (*Aw*, according to the Köppen climate classification), milder due to the elevation and with two distinct seasons: the rainy season, from October to April, and the dry season, from May to September.[25] The average temperature is 21.4 °C (70.5 °F).[26] September, at the end of the dry season, has the highest average maximum temperature, 29.1 °C (84.4 °F), and July has major and minor lower maximum average temperature, of 25.6 °C (78.1 °F) and 13.9 °C (57.0 °F), respectively.[27][28] Average temperatures from September through March are a consistent 22 °C (72 °F).[26] With 253.1 mm (10.0 in), November is the month with the highest rainfall of the year, while July is the lowest, with only 1.5 mm (0.1 in).[29] During the dry season, the city can have very low relative humidity levels, often below 30%.[30]\n\n\nAccording to the Brazilian National Institute of Meteorology (INMET), the record low temperature was 1.6 °C (34.9 °F) on 18 July 1975, and the record high was 36.4 °C (97.5 °F) on 18 October 2015[31] and 8 October 2020.[32][33] The highest accumulated rainfall in 24 hours was 132.8 mm (5.2 in) on 15 November 1963.[34]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Brasília (1991–2020, extremes 1961–present)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 32.6(90.7)\n | 32.0(89.6)\n | 32.1(89.8)\n | 31.6(88.9)\n | 31.6(88.9)\n | 31.6(88.9)\n | 30.8(87.4)\n | 33.0(91.4)\n | 35.7(96.3)\n | 36.4(97.5)\n | 34.5(94.1)\n | 33.7(92.7)\n | 36.4(97.5)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 26.9(80.4)\n | 27.2(81.0)\n | 27.0(80.6)\n | 26.8(80.2)\n | 26.0(78.8)\n | 25.3(77.5)\n | 25.6(78.1)\n | 27.4(81.3)\n | 29.1(84.4)\n | 29.0(84.2)\n | 27.0(80.6)\n | 26.8(80.2)\n | 27.0(80.6)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 21.9(71.4)\n | 21.9(71.4)\n | 21.8(71.2)\n | 21.6(70.9)\n | 20.3(68.5)\n | 19.3(66.7)\n | 19.3(66.7)\n | 21.0(69.8)\n | 22.8(73.0)\n | 23.1(73.6)\n | 21.7(71.1)\n | 21.7(71.1)\n | 21.4(70.5)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 18.3(64.9)\n | 18.2(64.8)\n | 18.2(64.8)\n | 17.7(63.9)\n | 15.6(60.1)\n | 14.2(57.6)\n | 13.9(57.0)\n | 15.3(59.5)\n | 17.6(63.7)\n | 18.5(65.3)\n | 18.1(64.6)\n | 18.3(64.9)\n | 17.0(62.6)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | 12.2(54.0)\n | 11.0(51.8)\n | 14.5(58.1)\n | 10.7(51.3)\n | 3.2(37.8)\n | 3.3(37.9)\n | 1.6(34.9)\n | 5.0(41.0)\n | 9.0(48.2)\n | 10.2(50.4)\n | 11.4(52.5)\n | 11.4(52.5)\n | 1.6(34.9)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 206.0(8.11)\n | 179.5(7.07)\n | 226.0(8.90)\n | 145.2(5.72)\n | 26.9(1.06)\n | 3.3(0.13)\n | 1.5(0.06)\n | 16.3(0.64)\n | 38.1(1.50)\n | 141.8(5.58)\n | 253.1(9.96)\n | 241.1(9.49)\n | 1,478.8(58.22)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 1.0 mm) | 16\n | 14\n | 15\n | 9\n | 3\n | 1\n | 0\n | 2\n | 4\n | 10\n | 17\n | 18\n | 109\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 74.7\n | 74.2\n | 76.1\n | 72.2\n | 65.4\n | 58.8\n | 51.0\n | 43.5\n | 46.4\n | 58.8\n | 74.5\n | 76.0\n | 64.3\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 159.6\n | 158.9\n | 168.7\n | 200.8\n | 237.9\n | 247.6\n | 268.3\n | 273.5\n | 225.7\n | 191.3\n | 138.3\n | 145.0\n | 2,415.6\n |\n| Source 1: Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia[27][26][28][29][35][36][37] |\n| Source 2: Meteo Climat (record highs and lows)[38] |\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Brazilians, Demographics of Brazil, and Immigration to Brazil\n\n![](image)Brasilia at night from ISS\n### Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\n| Race and ethnicity in Brasília |\n| --- |\n| Ethnicity |  | Percentage |\n| Pardo (Multiracial) |  | 48.2% |\n| White |  | 42.2% |\n| Black |  | 7.7% |\n| Asian |  | 1.6% |\n| Amerindian |  | 0.2% |\n\nAccording to the 2010 IBGE Census, 2,469,489 people resided in Brasilia and its metropolitan area,[39] of whom 1,239,882 were Pardo (Multiracial) (48.2%), 1,084,418 White (42.2%), 198,072 Black (7.7%), 41,522 Asian (1.6%), and 6,128 Amerindian (0.2%).[40]\n\n\nIn 2010, Brasilia was ranked the fourth-most populous city in Brazil after São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Salvador.[41] In 2010, the city had 474,871 opposite-sex couples and 1,241 same-sex couples. The population of Brasilia was 52.2% female and 47.8% male.[40]\n\n\nIn the 1960 census there were almost 140,000 residents in the new Federal district. By 1970 this figure had grown to 537,000. By 2010 the population of the Federal District had surpassed 2,5 million. The city of Brasilia proper, the plano piloto was planned for about 500,000 inhabitants, a figure the plano piloto never surpassed, with a current population of only 214,529,[42] but its metropolitan area within the Federal District has grown past this figure.[43]\n\n\nFrom the beginning, the growth of Brasilia was greater than original estimates. According to the original plans, Brasilia would be a city for government authorities and staff. However, during its construction, Brazilians from all over the country migrated to the satellite cities of Brasilia, seeking public and private employment.[44]\n\n\nAt the close of the 20th century, Brasilia was the largest city in the world which had not existed at the beginning of the century.[45] Brasilia has one of the highest population growth rates in Brazil, with annual growth of 2.82%, mostly due to internal migration.\n\n\nBrasilia's inhabitants include a foreign population of mostly embassy workers as well as large numbers of Brazilian internal migrants. Today, the city has important communities of immigrants and refugees. The city's Human Development Index was 0.936 in 2000 (developed level), and the city's literacy rate was around 95.65%.\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Religion in Brazil, Protestantism in Brazil, and Roman Catholic Church in Brazil\n\n![](image)The Cathedral of Brasilia\nChristianity is by far the most prevalent religion in Brasília, with Roman Catholicism being the largest denomination.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Religion\n | Percentage\n | Number\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Catholic | 56.62%\n | 1,455,134\n |\n| Protestant | 26.88%\n | 690,982\n |\n| No religion | 9.20%\n | 236,528\n |\n| Other\n | 3.72%\n | 95,605\n |\n| Spiritist | 3.50%\n | 89,836\n |\n| Jewish | 0.04%\n | 1,103\n |\n| Muslim | 0.04%\n | 972\n |\n| Total\n | 100.00%\n | 2,570,160\n |\n\n\n*Source: IBGE 2010.[46]* \n\n\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Constitution of Brazil\n\n![](image)Palácio Buriti, seat of government of the Federal District\nBrasília does not have a mayor or councillors, because article 32 of the Constitution of Brazil expressly prohibits the Federal District being divided into municipalities.\n\n\nThe Federal District is a legal entity of internal public law, which is part of the political-administrative structure of Brazil of a *sui generis* nature, because it is neither a state nor a municipality, but rather a special entity that incorporates the legislative powers reserved to the states and municipalities, as provided in Article 32, § 1º of the Constitution, which gives it a hybrid nature, both state and municipal.[47]\n\n\nThe executive power of the Federal District was represented by the mayor of the Federal District until 1969, when the position was transformed into governor of the Federal District.[48][49]\n\n\nThe legislative power of the Federal District is represented by the Legislative Chamber of the Federal District, whose nomenclature includes a mixture of legislative assembly (legislative power of the other units of the federation) and of municipal chamber (legislative of the municipalities). The Legislative Chamber is made up of 24 district deputies.[50]\n\n\n\n![](image)Legislative Chamber of the Federal District building\nThe judicial power which serves the Federal District also serves federal territories as it is constituted, but Brazil does not have any territories. Therefore, the Court of Justice of the Federal District and of the Territories only serves the Federal District.\n\n\nPart of the budget of the Federal District Government comes from the Constitutional Fund of the Federal District. In 2012, the fund totaled 9.6 billion reais.[51] By 2015, the forecast is 12.4 billion reais, of which more than half (6.4 billion) is spent on public security spending.[52]\n\n\n\n### International relations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of twin towns and sister cities in Brazil\n\nTwin towns and sister cities\nBrasilia is twinned with:[53]\n\n\n\n* ![](image) **Abuja**, Nigeria[53]\n* ![](image) **Asunción**, Paraguay[53]\n* ![](image) **Brussels**, Belgium[53]\n* ![](image) **Buenos Aires**, Argentina *(since 2002)*[53]\n* ![](image) **Gaza City**, Palestine[53]\n* ![](image) **Havana**, Cuba[53]\n* ![](image) **Khartoum**, Sudan[53]\n* ![](image) **Lisbon**, Portugal[54]\n* ![](image) **Luxor**, Egypt[53]\n* ![](image) **Montevideo**, Uruguay[53]\n* ![](image) **Pretoria**, South Africa[53]\n* ![](image) **Santiago**, Chile[53]\n* ![](image) **Tehran**, Iran[53]\n* ![](image) **Vienna**, Austria[53]\n* ![](image) **Washington, D.C.**, United States *(since 2013)*[55]\n* ![](image) **Xi'an**, China *(since 1997)*[53]\n* ![](image) **Guadalajara**, Mexico.[56]\n\nOf these, Abuja and Washington, D.C. were also cities specifically planned as the seat of government of their respective countries.\n\n\n\nBrasília Declarations\nBrasília is associated with several significant declarations in the international political and social field, including:\n\n\n\n* The Brasília Declaration of the IBSA Dialogue Forum (2003), signed by the foreign ministers of India, Brazil and South Africa (IBSA) regarding representation at the United Nations Security Council\n* Brasília Declaration on the Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons in the Americas (2010)[57]\n* Brasília Declaration on Child Labour (2013), issued by the Third Global Conference on Child Labour – hosted in Brasília by the Brazilian Government[58]\n* Brasília Declaration of Judges on Water Justice (2018), adopted in 2018 during the Conference of Judges and Prosecutors on Water Justice at the 8th World Water Forum, described as \"a landmark in [the] development of water justice jurisprudence\"[59]\n* The 15th Conference of Defense Ministers of the Americas, meeting in Brasília in 2022, issued a Declaration condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine.[60]\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Economy of Brazil\n\n![](image)South Banking Sector\n![](image)South Hotel Sector\n![](image)Brasília products treemap, 2020\nThe major roles of construction and of services (government, communications, banking and finance, food production, entertainment, and legal services) in Brasilia's economy reflect the city's status as a governmental rather than an industrial center.\n\n\nIndustries connected with construction, food processing, and furnishings are important, as are those associated with publishing, printing, and computer software. The gross domestic product (GDP) is divided in Public Administration 54.8%, Services 28.7%, Industry 10.2%, Commerce 6.1%, Agrobusiness 0.2%.[61]\n\n\nBesides being the political center, Brasilia is an important economic center. In 2018, it has the third highest GDP of cities in Brazil, R$254 billion reais,[62] representing 3.6% of the total Brazilian GDP. Most economic activity in the federal capital results from its administrative function.\n\n\nIts industrial planning is studied carefully by the Government of the Federal District. Being a city registered by UNESCO,[63] the government in Brasilia has opted to encourage the development of non-polluting industries such as software, film, video, and gemology among others, with emphasis on environmental preservation and maintaining ecological balance, preserving the city property.\n\n\nAccording to Mercer's city rankings of cost of living for expatriate employees, Brasilia ranks 45th among the most expensive cities in the world in 2012, up from the 70th position in 2010, ranking behind São Paulo (12th) and Rio de Janeiro (13th).\n\n\n\n### Industries[edit]\n\n\nIndustries in the city include construction (Paulo Octavio, Via Construções, and Irmãos Gravia among others); food processing (Perdigão, Sadia); furniture making; recycling (Novo Rio, Rexam, Latasa and others); pharmaceuticals (União Química); and graphic industries. The main agricultural products produced in the city are coffee, guavas, strawberries, oranges, lemons, papayas, soybeans, and mangoes. It has over 110,000 cows and it exports wood products worldwide.\n\n\nThe Federal District, where Brasilia is located, has a GDP of R$133,4 billion (about US$64.1 billion), about the same as Belarus according to The Economist. Its share of the total Brazilian GDP is about 3.8%.[64] The Federal District has the largest GDP per capita income of Brazil US$25,062, slightly higher than Belarus.[64]\n\n\nThe city's planned design included specific areas for almost everything, including accommodation, Hotels Sectors North and South. New hotel facilities are being developed elsewhere, such as the hotels and tourism Sector North, located on the shores of Lake Paranoá.\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Culture of Brazil\n\n![](image)Cultural Complex of the Republic\nAs a venue for political events, music performances and movie festivals, Brasilia is a cosmopolitan city, with around 124 embassies, a wide range of restaurants and a complete infrastructure ready to host any kind of event. Not surprisingly, the city stands out as an important business/tourism destination, which is an important part of the local economy, with dozens of hotels spread around the federal capital. Traditional parties take place throughout the year.\n\n\nIn June, large festivals known as \"festas juninas\" are held celebrating Catholic saints such as Saint Anthony of Padua, Saint John the Baptist, and Saint Peter. On 7 September, the traditional Independence Day parade is held on the Ministries Esplanade. Throughout the year, local, national, and international events are held throughout the city. Christmas is widely celebrated, and New Year's Eve usually hosts major events celebrated in the city.[65]\n\n\nThe city also hosts a varied assortment of art works from artists like Bruno Giorgi, Alfredo Ceschiatti, Athos Bulcão, Marianne Peretti, Alfredo Volpi, Di Cavalcanti, Dyllan Taxman, Victor Brecheret and Burle Marx, whose works have been integrated into the city's architecture, making it a unique landscape. The cuisine in the city is very diverse. Many of the best restaurants in the city can be found in the Asa Sul district.[66]\n\n\nThe city is the birthplace of Brazilian rock and place of origin of bands like: Legião Urbana, Capital Inicial, Aborto Elétrico, Plebe Rude and Raimundos. Brasilia has the Rock Basement Festival which brings new bands to the national scene. The festival is held in the parking Brasilia National Stadium Mané Garrincha.\n\n\n\n![](image)Cláudio Santoro National Theater\nSince 1965, the annual Brasilia Festival of Brazilian Cinema is one of the most traditional cinema festivals in Brazil, being compared only to the Brazilian Cinema Festival of Gramado, in Rio Grande do Sul. The difference between both is that the festival in Brasilia still preserves the tradition to only submit and reward Brazilian movies.\n\n\nThe International Dance Seminar in Brasilia has brought top-notch dance to the Federal Capital since 1991. International teachers, shows with choreographers and guest groups and scholarships abroad are some of the hallmarks of the event. The Seminar is the central axis of the DANCE BRAZIL program and is promoted by the DF State Department of Culture in partnership with the Cultural Association Claudio Santoro. [1]\n\n\nBrasilia has also been the focus of modern-day literature. Published in 2008, *The World In Grey: Dom Bosco's Prophecy*, by author Ryan J. Lucero, tells an apocalyptical story based on the famous prophecy from the late 19th century by the Italian saint Don Bosco.[67] According to Don Bosco's prophecy:[68] \"Between parallels 15 and 20, around a lake which shall be formed; A great civilization will thrive, and that will be the Promised Land\". Brasilia lies between the parallels 15° S and 20° S, where an artificial lake (Paranoá Lake) was formed. Don Bosco is Brasilia's patron saint.\n\n\n*American Flagg!*, the First Comics comic book series created by Howard Chaykin, portrays Brasilia as a cosmopolitan world capital of culture and exotic romance. In the series, it is a top vacation and party destination. The 2015 Rede Globo series *Felizes para Sempre?* was set in Brasilia.[69]\n\n\n\n### Architecture and urbanism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Brazilian Flag and the National Congress in spring\nAt the Square of Three Powers, Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer and Brazilian structural engineer Joaquim Cardozo made buildings in the style of modern Brazilian architecture.[70] The Congress also occupies various other surrounding buildings, some connected by tunnels.\n\n\nThe National Congress building is located in the middle of the Eixo Monumental, the city's main avenue. In front lies a large lawn and reflecting pool. The building faces the Praça dos Três Poderes where the Palácio do Planalto and the Supreme Federal Court are located. The Brazilian landscape architect Roberto Burle Marx designed landmark modernist gardens for some of the principal buildings. In residential areas, buildings were built that were inspired in French modernist and bauhaus design.[71]\n\n\nAlthough not fully accomplished, the \"Brasilia utopia\" has produced a city of relatively high quality of life, in which the citizens live in forested areas with sporting and leisure structure (the **superquadras**) surrounded by small commercial areas, bookstores and cafés; the city is famous for its cuisine and efficiency of transit.[72] Even these positive features have sparked controversy, expressed in the nickname \"ilha da fantasia\" (\"fantasy island\"), indicating the sharp contrast between the city and surrounding regions, marked by poverty and disorganization in the cities of the states of Goiás and Minas Gerais, around Brasilia.[72]\n\n\nCritics of Brasilia's grand scale have characterized it as a modernist bauhaus platonic fantasy about the future:\n\n\n\n![](image)The Monumental Axis\n![](image)Aerial view of South Wing (*Asa Sul*) district\n![](image)Monumental Axis and Brasilia TV Tower\n\n> Nothing dates faster than people's fantasies about the future. This is what you get when perfectly decent, intelligent, and talented men start thinking in terms of space rather than place; and single rather than multiple meanings. It's what you get when you design for political aspirations rather than real human needs. You get miles of jerry-built platonic nowhere infested with Volkswagens. This, one may fervently hope, is the last experiment of its kind. The utopian buck stops here.\n> \n> — Robert Hughes, *The Shock of the New*, Episode 4: \"Trouble in Utopia\", (1980)\n> \n\n\n#### Notable structures[edit]\n\n\nThe Cathedral of Brasilia in the capital of the Federative Republic of Brazil, is an expression of the atheist architect Oscar Niemeyer and the structural engineer Joaquim Cardozo. This concrete-framed hyperboloid structure, seems with its glass roof reaching up, open, to the heavens.\n\n\nThe cathedral's structure was finished on 31 May 1970, and only the 70 m (229.66 ft) diameter of the circular area were visible. Niemeyer's and Cardozo's project of Cathedral of Brasilia is based in the hyperboloid of revolution which sections are asymmetric. The hyperboloid structure itself is a result of 16 identical assembled concrete columns. There is controversy as to what these columns, having hyperbolic section and weighing 90 t, represent, some say they are two hands moving upwards to heaven, others associate it to the chalice Jesus used in the last supper and some claim it represent his crown of thorns. The cathedral was dedicated on 31 May 1970.\n\n\nAt the end of the *Eixo Monumental* (\"Monumental Axis\") lies the *Esplanada dos Ministérios* (\"Ministries Esplanade\"),[73] an open area in downtown Brasilia. The rectangular lawn is surrounded by two eight-lane avenues where many government buildings, monuments and memorials are located. On Sundays and holidays, the Eixo Monumental is closed to cars so that locals may use it as a place to walk, bike, and have picnics under the trees.\n\n\n*Praça dos Três Poderes* (Portuguese for *Square of the Three Powers*) is a plaza in Brasilia. The name is derived from the encounter of the three federal branches around the plaza: the Executive, represented by the Palácio do Planalto (presidential office); the Legislative, represented by the National Congress (Congresso Nacional); and the Judiciary branch, represented by the Supreme Federal Court (Supremo Tribunal Federal). It is a tourist attraction in Brasilia, designed by Lúcio Costa and Oscar Niemeyer as a place where the three branches would meet harmoniously.\n\n\n\n![](image)Praça dos Três Poderes (Three Powers Plaza)\n![](image)The Palácio da Alvorada\nThe Palácio da Alvorada is the official residence of the president of Brazil. The palace was designed, along with the rest of the city of Brasilia, by Oscar Niemeyer and inaugurated in 1958. One of the first structures built in the republic's new capital city, the \"Alvorada\" lies on a peninsula at the shore of Lake Paranoá.\n\n\nThe principles of simplicity and modernity that in the past characterized the great works of architecture motivated Niemeyer. The viewer has an impression of looking at a glass box, softly landing on the ground with the support of thin external columns. The building has an area of 7,000 m2 with three floors consisting of the basement, landing, and second floor.\n\n\nThe auditorium, kitchen, laundry, medical center, and administration offices are at basement level. The rooms used by the presidency for official receptions are on the landing. The second floor has four suites, two apartments, and various private rooms which make up the residential part of the palace. The building also has a library, a heated Olympic-sized swimming pool, a music room, two dining rooms and various meeting rooms. A chapel and heliport are in adjacent buildings.\n\n\nThe Palácio do Planalto is the official workplace of the president of Brazil. It is located at the Praça dos Três Poderes in Brasilia. As the seat of government, the term \"Planalto\" is often used as a metonym for the executive branch of government. The main working office of the President of the Republic is in the Palácio do Planalto.\n\n\nThe President and his or her family do not live in it, rather in the official residence, the Palácio da Alvorada. Besides the President, senior advisors also have offices in the \"Planalto\", including the Vice-President of Brazil and the Chief of Staff. The other Ministries are along the Esplanada dos Ministérios. The architect of the Palácio do Planalto was Oscar Niemeyer, creator of most of the important buildings in Brasilia. The idea was to project an image of simplicity and modernity using fine lines and waves to compose the columns and exterior structures. The Palace is four stories high, and has an area of 36,000 m2. Four other adjacent buildings are also part of the complex.\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)View of the University of Brasilia\nSee also: Education in Brazil\n\nThe city has six international schools: American School of Brasilia, Brasilia International School (BIS), Escola das Nações, Swiss International School (SIS), Lycée français François-Mitterrand (LfFM) and Maple Bear Canadian School.[74] August 2016 will see the opening of a new international school – the British School of Brasilia. Brasilia has two universities, three university centers, and many private colleges.\n\n\nThe main tertiary educational institutions are: Universidade de Brasilia – University of Brasilia (UnB) (public); Universidade Católica de Brasilia – Catholic University of Brasilia (UCB); Centro Universitário de Brasilia (UniCEUB); Centro Universitário Euroamaricano (Unieuro); Centro Universitário do Distrito Federal [pt] (UDF); Universidade Paulista [pt] (UNIP); and Instituto de Educação Superior de Brasilia (IESB).\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\nThe average commute time on public transit in Brasilia, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 96 min. 31% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 28 min, while 61% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 15.1 km (9.4 mi), while 50% travel for over 12 km (7.5 mi) in a single direction.[75]\n\n\n\n### Airport[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Brasília International Airport\n\n![](image)Brasilia International Airport (BSB)\n![](image)Aerial view of the airport\nBrasilia–Presidente Juscelino Kubitschek International Airport serves the metropolitan area with major domestic and international flights. It is the third busiest Brazilian airport based on passengers and aircraft movements.[76] Because of its strategic location it is a civil aviation hub for the rest of the country. This results in a large number of takeoffs and landings and it is not unusual for flights to be delayed in a holding pattern before landing. Following the airport's master plan, Infraero built a second runway, which was finished in 2006. In 2007, the airport handled 11,119,872 passengers.[76] The main building's third floor, with 12 thousand square meters, has a panoramic deck, a food court, shops, four movie theaters with total capacity of 500 people, and space for exhibitions. Brasilia Airport has 136 vendor spaces. The airport is located about 11 km (6.8 mi) from the central area of Brasilia, outside the metro system. The area outside the airport's main gate is lined with taxis as well as several bus line services that connect the airport to Brasilia's central district. The parking lot accommodates 1,200 cars.[77]\n\n\nThe airport is serviced by domestic and regional airlines (TAM, GOL, Azul, WebJET, Trip and Avianca), in addition to a number of international carriers. In 2012, Brasilia's International Airport was won by the InfraAmerica consortium, formed by the Brazilian engineering company ENGEVIX and the Argentine Corporacion America holding company, with a 50% stake each.[78] During the 25-year concession, the airport may be expanded to up to 40 million passengers a year.[79]\n\n\nIn 2014 the airport received 15 new boarding bridges, totaling 28 in all. This was the main requirement made by the federal government, which transferred the operation of the terminal to the Inframerica Group after an auction. The group invested R$750 million in the project. In the same year, the number of parking spaces doubled, reaching three thousand. The airport's entrance has a new rooftop cover and a new access road. Furthermore, a VIP room was created on Terminal 1's third floor. The investments resulted an increase the capacity of Brasilia's airport from approximately 15 million passengers per year to 21 million by 2014.[80] Brasília Air Force Base - ALA1, one of their most important bases of the Brazilian Air Force, is located in Brasília.\n\n\n\n### Road transport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Juscelino Kubitschek Bridge\nLike most Brazilian cities, Brasilia has a good network of taxi companies. Taxis from the airport are available outside the terminal, but at times there can be quite a queue of people. Although the airport is not far from the downtown area, taxi prices do seem to be higher than in other Brazilian cities. Booking in advance can be advantageous, particularly if time is limited, and local companies should be able to assist airport transfer or transport requirements.\n\n\nThe Juscelino Kubitschek bridge, also known as the 'President JK Bridge' or the 'JK Bridge', crosses Lake Paranoá in Brasilia. It is named after Juscelino Kubitschek, former president of Brazil. It was designed by architect Alexandre Chan and structural engineer Mário Vila Verde. Chan won the Gustav Lindenthal Medal[81] for this project at the 2003 International Bridge Conference in Pittsburgh due to \"...outstanding achievement demonstrating harmony with the environment, aesthetic merit and successful community participation\". It consists of three 60 m (200 ft) tall asymmetrical steel arches that crisscross diagonally. With a length of 1,200 m (0.75 miles), it was completed in 2002 at a cost of US$56.8 million. The bridge has a pedestrian walkway and is accessible to bicyclists and skaters.\n\n\n\n![](image)Central Bus Station\nThe main bus hub in Brasilia is the Central Bus Station, located in the crossing of the Eixo Monumental and the Eixão, about 2 km (1.2 mi) from the Three Powers Plaza. The original plan was to have a bus station as near as possible to every corner of Brasilia. Today, the bus station is the hub of urban buses only, some running within Brasilia and others connecting Brasilia to the satellite cities. In the original city plan, the interstate buses would also stop at the Central Station. Because of the growth of Brasilia (and corresponding growth in the bus fleet), today the interstate buses leave from the older interstate station (called Rodoferroviária) located at the western end of the Eixo Monumental. The Central Bus Station also contains a main metro station. A new bus station was opened in July 2010. It is on Saída Sul (South Exit) near Parkshopping Mall with its metro station, and is also an inter-state bus station, used only to leave the Federal District.\n\n\n\n### Metro[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Federal District Metro\nThere is no passenger rail service in Brasilia, but the Expresso Pequi rail line is planned to link Brasilia and Goiânia. A 22 km light rail line is planned, estimated to cost between 1 billion reais (US$258 million) and 1.5 billion reais with capacity to transport around 200,000 passengers per day.[82]\n\n\nThe Federal District Metro is Federal District's underground metro system. The system has 24 stations on two lines, the Orange and Green lines, along a total network of 43 km (27 mi), covering some of the Federal District. Both lines begin at the Central Station and run parallel until the Águas Claras Station. The Federal District Metro is not comprehensive so buses may provide better access to the center. The metro leaves the Rodoviária (bus station) and goes south, avoiding most of the political and tourist areas. The main purpose of the metro is to serve cities, such as Samambaia, Taguatinga and Ceilândia, as well as Guará and Águas Claras. The satellite cities served are more populated in total than the Plano Piloto itself (the census of 2000 indicated that Ceilândia had 344,039 inhabitants, Taguatinga had 243,575, and the Plano Piloto had approximately 400,000 inhabitants), and most residents of the satellite cities depend on public transportation.[83]\n\n\nA high-speed railway was planned between Brasilia and Goiânia, the capital of the state of Goias, but it will probably be turned into a regional service linking the capital cities and cities in between, like Anápolis and Alexânia.[84]\n\n\n\n## Sport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Estádio Nacional de Brasilia\nThe main stadiums are the Brasilia National Stadium Mané Garrincha (which was re-inaugurated on 18 May 2013), the Serejão Stadium (home for Brasiliense) and the Bezerrão Stadium (home for Gama).\n\n\nBrasilia was one of the host cities of the 2014 FIFA World Cup and 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, for which Brazil is the host nation. Brasilia hosted the opening of the Confederations Cup and hosted 7 World Cup games.[85] Brasilia also hosted the football tournaments during the 2016 Summer Olympics held in Rio de Janeiro.\n\n\n\n![](image)Nilson Nelson Gymnasium\nBrasilia is known as a departing point for the practice of unpowered air sports, sports that may be practiced with hang gliding or paragliding wings. Practitioners of such sports reveal that, because of the city's dry weather, the city offers strong thermal winds and great \"cloud-streets\", which is also the name for a maneuver quite appreciated by practitioners. In 2003, Brasilia hosted the 14th Hang Gliding World Championship, one of the categories of free flying. In August 2005, the city hosted the second stage of the Brazilian Hang Gliding Championship.\n\n\nBrasilia is the site of the Autódromo Internacional Nelson Piquet which hosted a non-championship round of the 1974 Formula One Grand Prix season. An IndyCar race was cancelled at the last minute in 2015. The track, which has been closed since 2015, is being renovated for the end of 2023.\n\n\nThe city is also home to Uniceub BRB, one of Brazil's best basketball clubs, who became NBB champion in 2010, 2011 and 2012. The club hosts some of its games at the 16,000 all-seat Nilson Nelson Gymnasium.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Brazil portal\n* ![map](image)Latin America portal\n* ![icon](image)Geography portal\n\n\n* List of purpose-built national capitals\n\n\n**Purpose-built Brazilian state capitals**\n\n\n\n* Aracaju\n* Belo Horizonte\n* Boa Vista\n* Palmas\n* Teresina\n\n\n## Explanatory notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The administrative region of Brasília recorded a population of 214,529 in a 2012 survey; IBGE demographic publications do not make this distinction and considers the entire population of the Federal District.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** IBGE: Brasília Archived 17 October 2013 at the Wayback Machine IBGE.

Brasília was not, in fact, planned in any meaningful way. The Brazilian architect and planner Lúcio Costa's entry for the design competition for the new city in 1956 was a series of sketches of ideal urban forms of communal apartment blocks loosely based on Le Corbusier's Ville Radieuse of 1935, and 'superblocks' of single-family houses based on the North American Radburn layout (1929). He subsequently elaborated these into the Plano Piloto (Pilot Plan), and added the satellite city of Taguatinga.\n18. **^** Peter William Kellett; Felipe Hernández; Lea Knudsen Allen, eds.

The city is located high in the Brazilian highlands in the country's Central-West region. It was founded by President Juscelino Kubitschek on 21 April 1960, to serve as the new national capital. Brasília is estimated to be Brazil's third-most populous city after São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.[1] Among major Latin American cities, it has the highest GDP per capita.[6]\n\n\nBrasília was a planned city developed by Lúcio Costa, Oscar Niemeyer and Joaquim Cardozo in 1956 in a scheme to move the capital from Rio de Janeiro to a more central location. The landscape architect was Roberto Burle Marx.[7][8] The city's design divides it into numbered blocks as well as sectors for specified activities, such as the Hotel Sector, the Banking Sector, and the Embassy Sector. Brasília was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987 due to its modernist architecture and uniquely artistic urban planning.[9] It was named \"City of Design\" by UNESCO in October 2017 and has been part of the Creative Cities Network since then.[10]\n\n\nBrasília is a planned city distinguished by its white, modern architecture, designed by Oscar Niemeyer. All three branches of Brazil's federal government are centered in the city: executive, legislative and judiciary. Brasília also hosts 124 foreign embassies.[11] The city's international airport connects it to all other major Brazilian cities and some international destinations, and it is the third-busiest airport in Brazil. It was one of the main host cities of the 2014 FIFA World Cup and hosted some of the football matches during the 2016 Summer Olympics; it also hosted the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup.\n\n\nLaid out in the shape of an airplane, its \"fuselage\" is the Monumental Axis, a pair of wide avenue flanking a large park. In the \"cockpit\" is Praça dos Três Poderes, named for the 3 branches of government surrounding it. Brasília has a unique legal status, as it is an administrative region rather than a municipality like other cities in Brazil. The name \"Brasília\" is often used as a synonym for the Federal District as a whole, which is divided into 33 administrative regions, one of which (Plano Piloto) includes the area of the originally planned city and its federal government buildings. The rest of the Federal District plus Plano Piloto are considered by IBGE to make up Brasília's city area.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: History of Brasília; Timeline of Brasília; History of Brazil; Planaltina, Federal District; Juscelino Kubitschek; Lúcio Costa; Oscar Niemeyer; Joaquim Cardozo; and Burle Marx\n\n### Background[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The foundation stone of Brasilia, Centennial Hill, erected in 1922 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Brazil's independence\nBrazil's first capital was Salvador; in 1763 Rio de Janeiro became Brazil's capital and remained so until 1960. During this period, resources tended to be centered in Brazil's southeastern region, and most of the country's population was concentrated near its Atlantic coast.[12] Brasilia's geographically central location fostered a more regionally neutral federal capital. An article of the country's first republican constitution, dated 1891, states that the capital should be moved from Rio de Janeiro to a place close to the country's center.\n\n\nThe plan was conceived in 1827 by José Bonifácio, an advisor to Emperor Pedro I. He presented a plan to the General Assembly of Brazil for a new city called Brasilia, with the idea of moving the capital westward from the heavily populated southeastern corridor. The bill was not enacted because Pedro I dissolved the Assembly.\n\n\nAccording to the legend, Italian saint Don Bosco in 1883 had a dream in which he described a futuristic city that roughly fitted Brasilia's location.[13] In Brasilia today, many references to Bosco, who founded the Salesian order, are found throughout the city and one church parish in the city bears his name.[14]\n\n\n\n### Costa plan[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Urban planner Lúcio Costa was the winner of the competition for the construction project of Brasília and played a key role in the city's landmarking.\n![](image)Plano Piloto\nJuscelino Kubitschek was elected President of Brazil in 1955. Upon taking office in January 1956, in fulfilment of his campaign pledge, he initiated the planning and construction of the new capital. The following year an international jury selected Lúcio Costa's plan to guide the construction of Brazil's new capital, Brasilia. Costa was a student of the famous modernist architect Le Corbusier, and some of modernism's architecture features can be found in his plan. Costa's plan was not as detailed as some of the plans presented by other architects and city planners. It did not include land use schedules, models, population charts or mechanical drawings; however, it was chosen by five out of six jurors because it had the features required to align the growth of a capital city.[15] Even though the initial plan was transformed over time, it oriented much of the construction and most of its features survived.\n\n\nBrasilia's accession as the new capital and its designation for the development of an extensive interior region inspired the symbolism of the plan. Costa used a cross-axial design indicating the possession and conquest of this new place with a cross,[16] often likened to a dragonfly, an airplane or a bird.[15] Costa's plan included two principal components, the Monumental Axis (east to west) and the Residential Axis (north to south). The Monumental Axis was assigned political and administrative activities, and is considered the body of the city with the style and simplicity of its buildings, oversized scales, and broad vistas and heights, producing the idea of Monumentality. This axis includes the various ministries, national congress, presidential palace, supreme court building and the television and radio tower.[16] The Residential Axis was intended to contain areas with intimate character and is considered the most important achievement of the plan; it was designed for housing and associated functions such as local commerce, schooling, recreation and churches, constituted of 96 superblocks [pt] limited to six-story buildings and 12 additional superblocks limited to three-story buildings;[15] Costa's intention with superblocks was to have small self-contained and self-sufficient neighborhoods and uniform buildings with apartments of two or three different categories, where he envisioned the integration of upper and middle classes sharing the same residential area.[16]\n\n\nThe urban design of the communal apartment blocks was based on Le Corbusier's Ville Radieuse of 1935, and the superblocks on the North American Radburn layout from 1929.[17] Visually, the blocks were intended to appear absorbed by the landscape because they were isolated by a belt of tall trees and lower vegetation. Costa attempted to introduce a Brazil that was more equitable, he also designed housing for the working classes that was separated from the upper- and middle-class housing and was visually different, with the intention of avoiding slums (*favelas*) in the urban periphery.[15][18] The *superquadra* has been accused of being a space where individuals are oppressed and alienated to a form of spatial segregation.[19]\n\n\nOne of the main objectives of the plan was to allow the free flow of automobile traffic, the plan included lanes of traffic in a north–south direction (seven for each direction) for the Monumental Axis and three arterials (the W3, the Eixo and the L2) for the residential Axis;[16] the cul-de-sac access roads of the superblocks were planned to be the end of the main flow of traffic. And the reason behind the heavy emphasis on automobile traffic is the architect's desire to establish the concept of modernity in every level.\n\n\n\n![](image)Brasília in 1958. Only Asa Sul is already leased, and Ministries Esplanade is also visible.\n![](image)Construction of the Ministries Esplanade in 1959\n![](image)Brasilia in 1964\nThough automobiles were invented prior to the 20th century, mass production of vehicles in the early 20th made them widely available; thus, they became a symbol of modernity. The two small axes around the Monumental axis provide loops and exits for cars to enter small roads. Some argue that his emphasis of the plan on automobiles caused the lengthening of distances between centers and it attended only the necessities of a small segment of the population who owned cars.[15] But one can not ignore the bus transportation system in the city. The buses routes inside the city operate heavily on W3 and L2. Almost anywhere, including satellite cities, can be reached just by taking the bus and most of the Plano Piloto can be reached without transferring to other buses.\n\n\nLater, as the population of the city increased, the transportation system also played an important role in mediating the relationship between the Pilot plan and the satellite cities. Due to the larger influx of vehicles, traffic lights were introduced to the Momument Axis, which violates the concept of modernity and advancement the architect first employed. Additionally, the metro system in Brasilia was mainly built for inhabitants of satellite cities. Though this growth has made Brasilia no longer a pure utopia with incomparable modernity, the later development of traffic management, bus routes to satellite cities, and the metro system all serve as a remedy to the dystopia, enabling the citizens to enjoy the kind of modernity that was not carefully planned.\n\n\nAt the intersection of the Monumental and Residential Axis Costa planned the city center with the transportation center (Rodoviaria), the banking sector and the hotel sector,[16] near to the city center, he proposed an amusement center with theaters, cinemas and restaurants. Costa's Plan is seen as a plan with a sectoral tendency, segregating all the banks, the office buildings, and the amusement center.[15]\n\n\nOne of the main features of Costa's plan was that he presented a new city with its future shape and patterns evident from the beginning. This meant that the original plan included paving streets that were not immediately put into use; the advantage of this was that the original plan is hard to undo because he provided for an entire street network, but on the other hand, is difficult to adapt and mold to other circumstances in the future.[15] In addition, there has been controversy with the monumental aspect of Lúcio Costa's Plan, because it appeared to some as 19th century city planning, not modern 20th century in urbanism.[20]\n\n\nAn interesting analysis can be made of Brasilia within the context of Cold War politics and the association of Lúcio Costa's plan to the symbolism of aviation. From an architectural perspective, the airplane-shaped plan was certainly an homage to Le Corbusier and his enchantment with the aircraft as an architectural masterpiece. However, Brasilia was constructed soon after the end of World War II. Despite Brazil's minor participation in the conflict, the airplane shape of the city was key in envisioning the country as part of the newly globalized world, together with the victorious Allies.[21] Furthermore, Brasilia is a unique example of modernism both as a guideline for architectural design but also as a principle for organizing society. Modernism in Brasilia is explored in James Holston's book, *The Modernist City*.[22]\n\n\n\n### Construction[edit]\n\n\nJuscelino Kubitschek, president of Brazil from 1956 to 1961, ordered Brasilia's construction, fulfilling the promise of the Constitution and his own political campaign promise. Building Brasilia was part of Juscelino's \"fifty years of prosperity in five\" plan. Already in 1892, the astronomer Louis Cruls, in the service of the Brazilian government, had investigated the site for the future capital. Lúcio Costa won a contest and was the main urban planner[23] in 1957, with 5550 people competing. Oscar Niemeyer was the chief architect of most public buildings, Joaquim Cardozo was the structural engineer, and Roberto Burle Marx was the landscape designer. Brasilia was built in 41 months, from 1956 to 21 April 1960, when it was officially inaugurated.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nAerial view of downtown Brasília (Pilot Plan) along the Monumental Axis, especially the new Mane Garrincha Stadium (left), the National Congress and the Three Powers Plaza (right).

Paranoá Lake, a large artificial lake, was built to increase the amount of water available and to maintain the region's humidity. It has a marina, and hosts wakeboarders and windsurfers. Diving can also be practiced and one of the main attractions is Vila Amaury, an old village submerged in the lake. This is where the first construction workers of Brasilia used to live.[24]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nBrasilia has a tropical savanna climate (*Aw*, according to the Köppen climate classification), milder due to the elevation and with two distinct seasons: the rainy season, from October to April, and the dry season, from May to September.[25] The average temperature is 21.4 °C (70.5 °F).[26] September, at the end of the dry season, has the highest average maximum temperature, 29.1 °C (84.4 °F), and July has major and minor lower maximum average temperature, of 25.6 °C (78.1 °F) and 13.9 °C (57.0 °F), respectively.[27][28] Average temperatures from September through March are a consistent 22 °C (72 °F).[26] With 253.1 mm (10.0 in), November is the month with the highest rainfall of the year, while July is the lowest, with only 1.5 mm (0.1 in).[29] During the dry season, the city can have very low relative humidity levels, often below 30%.[30]\n\n\nAccording to the Brazilian National Institute of Meteorology (INMET), the record low temperature was 1.6 °C (34.9 °F) on 18 July 1975, and the record high was 36.4 °C (97.5 °F) on 18 October 2015[31] and 8 October 2020.[32][33] The highest accumulated rainfall in 24 hours was 132.8 mm (5.2 in) on 15 November 1963.[34]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Brasília (1991–2020, extremes 1961–present)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 32.6(90.7)\n | 32.0(89.6)\n | 32.1(89.8)\n | 31.6(88.9)\n | 31.6(88.9)\n | 31.6(88.9)\n | 30.8(87.4)\n | 33.0(91.4)\n | 35.7(96.3)\n | 36.4(97.5)\n | 34.5(94.1)\n | 33.7(92.7)\n | 36.4(97.5)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 26.9(80.4)\n | 27.2(81.0)\n | 27.0(80.6)\n | 26.8(80.2)\n | 26.0(78.8)\n | 25.3(77.5)\n | 25.6(78.1)\n | 27.4(81.3)\n | 29.1(84.4)\n | 29.0(84.2)\n | 27.0(80.6)\n | 26.8(80.2)\n | 27.0(80.6)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 21.9(71.4)\n | 21.9(71.4)\n | 21.8(71.2)\n | 21.6(70.9)\n | 20.3(68.5)\n | 19.3(66.7)\n | 19.3(66.7)\n | 21.0(69.8)\n | 22.8(73.0)\n | 23.1(73.6)\n | 21.7(71.1)\n | 21.7(71.1)\n | 21.4(70.5)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 18.3(64.9)\n | 18.2(64.8)\n | 18.2(64.8)\n | 17.7(63.9)\n | 15.6(60.1)\n | 14.2(57.6)\n | 13.9(57.0)\n | 15.3(59.5)\n | 17.6(63.7)\n | 18.5(65.3)\n | 18.1(64.6)\n | 18.3(64.9)\n | 17.0(62.6)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | 12.2(54.0)\n | 11.0(51.8)\n | 14.5(58.1)\n | 10.7(51.3)\n | 3.2(37.8)\n | 3.3(37.9)\n | 1.6(34.9)\n | 5.0(41.0)\n | 9.0(48.2)\n | 10.2(50.4)\n | 11.4(52.5)\n | 11.4(52.5)\n | 1.6(34.9)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 206.0(8.11)\n | 179.5(7.07)\n | 226.0(8.90)\n | 145.2(5.72)\n | 26.9(1.06)\n | 3.3(0.13)\n | 1.5(0.06)\n | 16.3(0.64)\n | 38.1(1.50)\n | 141.8(5.58)\n | 253.1(9.96)\n | 241.1(9.49)\n | 1,478.8(58.22)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 1.0 mm) | 16\n | 14\n | 15\n | 9\n | 3\n | 1\n | 0\n | 2\n | 4\n | 10\n | 17\n | 18\n | 109\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 74.7\n | 74.2\n | 76.1\n | 72.2\n | 65.4\n | 58.8\n | 51.0\n | 43.5\n | 46.4\n | 58.8\n | 74.5\n | 76.0\n | 64.3\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 159.6\n | 158.9\n | 168.7\n | 200.8\n | 237.9\n | 247.6\n | 268.3\n | 273.5\n | 225.7\n | 191.3\n | 138.3\n | 145.0\n | 2,415.6\n |\n| Source 1: Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia[27][26][28][29][35][36][37] |\n| Source 2: Meteo Climat (record highs and lows)[38] |\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Brazilians, Demographics of Brazil, and Immigration to Brazil\n\n![](image)Brasilia at night from ISS\n### Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\n| Race and ethnicity in Brasília |\n| --- |\n| Ethnicity |  | Percentage |\n| Pardo (Multiracial) |  | 48.2% |\n| White |  | 42.2% |\n| Black |  | 7.7% |\n| Asian |  | 1.6% |\n| Amerindian |  | 0.2% |\n\nAccording to the 2010 IBGE Census, 2,469,489 people resided in Brasilia and its metropolitan area,[39] of whom 1,239,882 were Pardo (Multiracial) (48.2%), 1,084,418 White (42.2%), 198,072 Black (7.7%), 41,522 Asian (1.6%), and 6,128 Amerindian (0.2%).[40]\n\n\nIn 2010, Brasilia was ranked the fourth-most populous city in Brazil after São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Salvador.[41] In 2010, the city had 474,871 opposite-sex couples and 1,241 same-sex couples. The population of Brasilia was 52.2% female and 47.8% male.[40]\n\n\nIn the 1960 census there were almost 140,000 residents in the new Federal district. By 1970 this figure had grown to 537,000. By 2010 the population of the Federal District had surpassed 2,5 million. The city of Brasilia proper, the plano piloto was planned for about 500,000 inhabitants, a figure the plano piloto never surpassed, with a current population of only 214,529,[42] but its metropolitan area within the Federal District has grown past this figure.[43]\n\n\nFrom the beginning, the growth of Brasilia was greater than original estimates. According to the original plans, Brasilia would be a city for government authorities and staff. However, during its construction, Brazilians from all over the country migrated to the satellite cities of Brasilia, seeking public and private employment.[44]\n\n\nAt the close of the 20th century, Brasilia was the largest city in the world which had not existed at the beginning of the century.[45] Brasilia has one of the highest population growth rates in Brazil, with annual growth of 2.82%, mostly due to internal migration.\n\n\nBrasilia's inhabitants include a foreign population of mostly embassy workers as well as large numbers of Brazilian internal migrants. Today, the city has important communities of immigrants and refugees. The city's Human Development Index was 0.936 in 2000 (developed level), and the city's literacy rate was around 95.65%.\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Religion in Brazil, Protestantism in Brazil, and Roman Catholic Church in Brazil\n\n![](image)The Cathedral of Brasilia\nChristianity is by far the most prevalent religion in Brasília, with Roman Catholicism being the largest denomination.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Religion\n | Percentage\n | Number\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Catholic | 56.62%\n | 1,455,134\n |\n| Protestant | 26.88%\n | 690,982\n |\n| No religion | 9.20%\n | 236,528\n |\n| Other\n | 3.72%\n | 95,605\n |\n| Spiritist | 3.50%\n | 89,836\n |\n| Jewish | 0.04%\n | 1,103\n |\n| Muslim | 0.04%\n | 972\n |\n| Total\n | 100.00%\n | 2,570,160\n |\n\n\n*Source: IBGE 2010.[46]* \n\n\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Constitution of Brazil\n\n![](image)Palácio Buriti, seat of government of the Federal District\nBrasília does not have a mayor or councillors, because article 32 of the Constitution of Brazil expressly prohibits the Federal District being divided into municipalities.\n\n\nThe Federal District is a legal entity of internal public law, which is part of the political-administrative structure of Brazil of a *sui generis* nature, because it is neither a state nor a municipality, but rather a special entity that incorporates the legislative powers reserved to the states and municipalities, as provided in Article 32, § 1º of the Constitution, which gives it a hybrid nature, both state and municipal.[47]\n\n\nThe executive power of the Federal District was represented by the mayor of the Federal District until 1969, when the position was transformed into governor of the Federal District.[48][49]\n\n\nThe legislative power of the Federal District is represented by the Legislative Chamber of the Federal District, whose nomenclature includes a mixture of legislative assembly (legislative power of the other units of the federation) and of municipal chamber (legislative of the municipalities). The Legislative Chamber is made up of 24 district deputies.[50]\n\n\n\n![](image)Legislative Chamber of the Federal District building\nThe judicial power which serves the Federal District also serves federal territories as it is constituted, but Brazil does not have any territories. Therefore, the Court of Justice of the Federal District and of the Territories only serves the Federal District.\n\n\nPart of the budget of the Federal District Government comes from the Constitutional Fund of the Federal District. In 2012, the fund totaled 9.6 billion reais.[51] By 2015, the forecast is 12.4 billion reais, of which more than half (6.4 billion) is spent on public security spending.[52]\n\n\n\n### International relations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of twin towns and sister cities in Brazil\n\nTwin towns and sister cities\nBrasilia is twinned with:[53]\n\n\n\n* ![](image) **Abuja**, Nigeria[53]\n* ![](image) **Asunción**, Paraguay[53]\n* ![](image) **Brussels**, Belgium[53]\n* ![](image) **Buenos Aires**, Argentina *(since 2002)*[53]\n* ![](image) **Gaza City**, Palestine[53]\n* ![](image) **Havana**, Cuba[53]\n* ![](image) **Khartoum**, Sudan[53]\n* ![](image) **Lisbon**, Portugal[54]\n* ![](image) **Luxor**, Egypt[53]\n* ![](image) **Montevideo**, Uruguay[53]\n* ![](image) **Pretoria**, South Africa[53]\n* ![](image) **Santiago**, Chile[53]\n* ![](image) **Tehran**, Iran[53]\n* ![](image) **Vienna**, Austria[53]\n* ![](image) **Washington, D.C.**, United States *(since 2013)*[55]\n* ![](image) **Xi'an**, China *(since 1997)*[53]\n* ![](image) **Guadalajara**, Mexico.[56]\n\nOf these, Abuja and Washington, D.C. were also cities specifically planned as the seat of government of their respective countries.\n\n\n\nBrasília Declarations\nBrasília is associated with several significant declarations in the international political and social field, including:\n\n\n\n* The Brasília Declaration of the IBSA Dialogue Forum (2003), signed by the foreign ministers of India, Brazil and South Africa (IBSA) regarding representation at the United Nations Security Council\n* Brasília Declaration on the Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons in the Americas (2010)[57]\n* Brasília Declaration on Child Labour (2013), issued by the Third Global Conference on Child Labour – hosted in Brasília by the Brazilian Government[58]\n* Brasília Declaration of Judges on Water Justice (2018), adopted in 2018 during the Conference of Judges and Prosecutors on Water Justice at the 8th World Water Forum, described as \"a landmark in [the] development of water justice jurisprudence\"[59]\n* The 15th Conference of Defense Ministers of the Americas, meeting in Brasília in 2022, issued a Declaration condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine.[60]\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Economy of Brazil\n\n![](image)South Banking Sector\n![](image)South Hotel Sector\n![](image)Brasília products treemap, 2020\nThe major roles of construction and of services (government, communications, banking and finance, food production, entertainment, and legal services) in Brasilia's economy reflect the city's status as a governmental rather than an industrial center.\n\n\nIndustries connected with construction, food processing, and furnishings are important, as are those associated with publishing, printing, and computer software. The gross domestic product (GDP) is divided in Public Administration 54.8%, Services 28.7%, Industry 10.2%, Commerce 6.1%, Agrobusiness 0.2%.[61]\n\n\nBesides being the political center, Brasilia is an important economic center. In 2018, it has the third highest GDP of cities in Brazil, R$254 billion reais,[62] representing 3.6% of the total Brazilian GDP. Most economic activity in the federal capital results from its administrative function.\n\n\nIts industrial planning is studied carefully by the Government of the Federal District. Being a city registered by UNESCO,[63] the government in Brasilia has opted to encourage the development of non-polluting industries such as software, film, video, and gemology among others, with emphasis on environmental preservation and maintaining ecological balance, preserving the city property.\n\n\nAccording to Mercer's city rankings of cost of living for expatriate employees, Brasilia ranks 45th among the most expensive cities in the world in 2012, up from the 70th position in 2010, ranking behind São Paulo (12th) and Rio de Janeiro (13th).\n\n\n\n### Industries[edit]\n\n\nIndustries in the city include construction (Paulo Octavio, Via Construções, and Irmãos Gravia among others); food processing (Perdigão, Sadia); furniture making; recycling (Novo Rio, Rexam, Latasa and others); pharmaceuticals (União Química); and graphic industries. The main agricultural products produced in the city are coffee, guavas, strawberries, oranges, lemons, papayas, soybeans, and mangoes. It has over 110,000 cows and it exports wood products worldwide.\n\n\nThe Federal District, where Brasilia is located, has a GDP of R$133,4 billion (about US$64.1 billion), about the same as Belarus according to The Economist. Its share of the total Brazilian GDP is about 3.8%.[64] The Federal District has the largest GDP per capita income of Brazil US$25,062, slightly higher than Belarus.[64]\n\n\nThe city's planned design included specific areas for almost everything, including accommodation, Hotels Sectors North and South. New hotel facilities are being developed elsewhere, such as the hotels and tourism Sector North, located on the shores of Lake Paranoá.\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Culture of Brazil\n\n![](image)Cultural Complex of the Republic\nAs a venue for political events, music performances and movie festivals, Brasilia is a cosmopolitan city, with around 124 embassies, a wide range of restaurants and a complete infrastructure ready to host any kind of event. Not surprisingly, the city stands out as an important business/tourism destination, which is an important part of the local economy, with dozens of hotels spread around the federal capital. Traditional parties take place throughout the year.\n\n\nIn June, large festivals known as \"festas juninas\" are held celebrating Catholic saints such as Saint Anthony of Padua, Saint John the Baptist, and Saint Peter. On 7 September, the traditional Independence Day parade is held on the Ministries Esplanade. Throughout the year, local, national, and international events are held throughout the city. Christmas is widely celebrated, and New Year's Eve usually hosts major events celebrated in the city.[65]\n\n\nThe city also hosts a varied assortment of art works from artists like Bruno Giorgi, Alfredo Ceschiatti, Athos Bulcão, Marianne Peretti, Alfredo Volpi, Di Cavalcanti, Dyllan Taxman, Victor Brecheret and Burle Marx, whose works have been integrated into the city's architecture, making it a unique landscape. The cuisine in the city is very diverse. Many of the best restaurants in the city can be found in the Asa Sul district.[66]\n\n\nThe city is the birthplace of Brazilian rock and place of origin of bands like: Legião Urbana, Capital Inicial, Aborto Elétrico, Plebe Rude and Raimundos. Brasilia has the Rock Basement Festival which brings new bands to the national scene. The festival is held in the parking Brasilia National Stadium Mané Garrincha.\n\n\n\n![](image)Cláudio Santoro National Theater\nSince 1965, the annual Brasilia Festival of Brazilian Cinema is one of the most traditional cinema festivals in Brazil, being compared only to the Brazilian Cinema Festival of Gramado, in Rio Grande do Sul. The difference between both is that the festival in Brasilia still preserves the tradition to only submit and reward Brazilian movies.\n\n\nThe International Dance Seminar in Brasilia has brought top-notch dance to the Federal Capital since 1991. International teachers, shows with choreographers and guest groups and scholarships abroad are some of the hallmarks of the event. The Seminar is the central axis of the DANCE BRAZIL program and is promoted by the DF State Department of Culture in partnership with the Cultural Association Claudio Santoro. [1]\n\n\nBrasilia has also been the focus of modern-day literature. Published in 2008, *The World In Grey: Dom Bosco's Prophecy*, by author Ryan J. Lucero, tells an apocalyptical story based on the famous prophecy from the late 19th century by the Italian saint Don Bosco.[67] According to Don Bosco's prophecy:[68] \"Between parallels 15 and 20, around a lake which shall be formed; A great civilization will thrive, and that will be the Promised Land\". Brasilia lies between the parallels 15° S and 20° S, where an artificial lake (Paranoá Lake) was formed. Don Bosco is Brasilia's patron saint.\n\n\n*American Flagg!*, the First Comics comic book series created by Howard Chaykin, portrays Brasilia as a cosmopolitan world capital of culture and exotic romance. In the series, it is a top vacation and party destination. The 2015 Rede Globo series *Felizes para Sempre?* was set in Brasilia.[69]\n\n\n\n### Architecture and urbanism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Brazilian Flag and the National Congress in spring\nAt the Square of Three Powers, Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer and Brazilian structural engineer Joaquim Cardozo made buildings in the style of modern Brazilian architecture.[70] The Congress also occupies various other surrounding buildings, some connected by tunnels.\n\n\nThe National Congress building is located in the middle of the Eixo Monumental, the city's main avenue. In front lies a large lawn and reflecting pool. The building faces the Praça dos Três Poderes where the Palácio do Planalto and the Supreme Federal Court are located. The Brazilian landscape architect Roberto Burle Marx designed landmark modernist gardens for some of the principal buildings. In residential areas, buildings were built that were inspired in French modernist and bauhaus design.[71]\n\n\nAlthough not fully accomplished, the \"Brasilia utopia\" has produced a city of relatively high quality of life, in which the citizens live in forested areas with sporting and leisure structure (the **superquadras**) surrounded by small commercial areas, bookstores and cafés; the city is famous for its cuisine and efficiency of transit.[72] Even these positive features have sparked controversy, expressed in the nickname \"ilha da fantasia\" (\"fantasy island\"), indicating the sharp contrast between the city and surrounding regions, marked by poverty and disorganization in the cities of the states of Goiás and Minas Gerais, around Brasilia.[72]\n\n\nCritics of Brasilia's grand scale have characterized it as a modernist bauhaus platonic fantasy about the future:\n\n\n\n![](image)The Monumental Axis\n![](image)Aerial view of South Wing (*Asa Sul*) district\n![](image)Monumental Axis and Brasilia TV Tower\n\n> Nothing dates faster than people's fantasies about the future. This is what you get when perfectly decent, intelligent, and talented men start thinking in terms of space rather than place; and single rather than multiple meanings. It's what you get when you design for political aspirations rather than real human needs. You get miles of jerry-built platonic nowhere infested with Volkswagens. This, one may fervently hope, is the last experiment of its kind. The utopian buck stops here.\n> \n> — Robert Hughes, *The Shock of the New*, Episode 4: \"Trouble in Utopia\", (1980)\n> \n\n\n#### Notable structures[edit]\n\n\nThe Cathedral of Brasilia in the capital of the Federative Republic of Brazil, is an expression of the atheist architect Oscar Niemeyer and the structural engineer Joaquim Cardozo. This concrete-framed hyperboloid structure, seems with its glass roof reaching up, open, to the heavens.\n\n\nThe cathedral's structure was finished on 31 May 1970, and only the 70 m (229.66 ft) diameter of the circular area were visible. Niemeyer's and Cardozo's project of Cathedral of Brasilia is based in the hyperboloid of revolution which sections are asymmetric. The hyperboloid structure itself is a result of 16 identical assembled concrete columns. There is controversy as to what these columns, having hyperbolic section and weighing 90 t, represent, some say they are two hands moving upwards to heaven, others associate it to the chalice Jesus used in the last supper and some claim it represent his crown of thorns. The cathedral was dedicated on 31 May 1970.\n\n\nAt the end of the *Eixo Monumental* (\"Monumental Axis\") lies the *Esplanada dos Ministérios* (\"Ministries Esplanade\"),[73] an open area in downtown Brasilia. The rectangular lawn is surrounded by two eight-lane avenues where many government buildings, monuments and memorials are located. On Sundays and holidays, the Eixo Monumental is closed to cars so that locals may use it as a place to walk, bike, and have picnics under the trees.\n\n\n*Praça dos Três Poderes* (Portuguese for *Square of the Three Powers*) is a plaza in Brasilia. The name is derived from the encounter of the three federal branches around the plaza: the Executive, represented by the Palácio do Planalto (presidential office); the Legislative, represented by the National Congress (Congresso Nacional); and the Judiciary branch, represented by the Supreme Federal Court (Supremo Tribunal Federal). It is a tourist attraction in Brasilia, designed by Lúcio Costa and Oscar Niemeyer as a place where the three branches would meet harmoniously.\n\n\n\n![](image)Praça dos Três Poderes (Three Powers Plaza)\n![](image)The Palácio da Alvorada\nThe Palácio da Alvorada is the official residence of the president of Brazil. The palace was designed, along with the rest of the city of Brasilia, by Oscar Niemeyer and inaugurated in 1958. One of the first structures built in the republic's new capital city, the \"Alvorada\" lies on a peninsula at the shore of Lake Paranoá.\n\n\nThe principles of simplicity and modernity that in the past characterized the great works of architecture motivated Niemeyer. The viewer has an impression of looking at a glass box, softly landing on the ground with the support of thin external columns. The building has an area of 7,000 m2 with three floors consisting of the basement, landing, and second floor.\n\n\nThe auditorium, kitchen, laundry, medical center, and administration offices are at basement level. The rooms used by the presidency for official receptions are on the landing. The second floor has four suites, two apartments, and various private rooms which make up the residential part of the palace. The building also has a library, a heated Olympic-sized swimming pool, a music room, two dining rooms and various meeting rooms. A chapel and heliport are in adjacent buildings.\n\n\nThe Palácio do Planalto is the official workplace of the president of Brazil. It is located at the Praça dos Três Poderes in Brasilia. As the seat of government, the term \"Planalto\" is often used as a metonym for the executive branch of government. The main working office of the President of the Republic is in the Palácio do Planalto.\n\n\nThe President and his or her family do not live in it, rather in the official residence, the Palácio da Alvorada. Besides the President, senior advisors also have offices in the \"Planalto\", including the Vice-President of Brazil and the Chief of Staff. The other Ministries are along the Esplanada dos Ministérios. The architect of the Palácio do Planalto was Oscar Niemeyer, creator of most of the important buildings in Brasilia. The idea was to project an image of simplicity and modernity using fine lines and waves to compose the columns and exterior structures. The Palace is four stories high, and has an area of 36,000 m2. Four other adjacent buildings are also part of the complex.\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)View of the University of Brasilia\nSee also: Education in Brazil\n\nThe city has six international schools: American School of Brasilia, Brasilia International School (BIS), Escola das Nações, Swiss International School (SIS), Lycée français François-Mitterrand (LfFM) and Maple Bear Canadian School.[74] August 2016 will see the opening of a new international school – the British School of Brasilia. Brasilia has two universities, three university centers, and many private colleges.\n\n\nThe main tertiary educational institutions are: Universidade de Brasilia – University of Brasilia (UnB) (public); Universidade Católica de Brasilia – Catholic University of Brasilia (UCB); Centro Universitário de Brasilia (UniCEUB); Centro Universitário Euroamaricano (Unieuro); Centro Universitário do Distrito Federal [pt] (UDF); Universidade Paulista [pt] (UNIP); and Instituto de Educação Superior de Brasilia (IESB).\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\nThe average commute time on public transit in Brasilia, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 96 min. 31% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 28 min, while 61% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 15.1 km (9.4 mi), while 50% travel for over 12 km (7.5 mi) in a single direction.[75]\n\n\n\n### Airport[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Brasília International Airport\n\n![](image)Brasilia International Airport (BSB)\n![](image)Aerial view of the airport\nBrasilia–Presidente Juscelino Kubitschek International Airport serves the metropolitan area with major domestic and international flights. It is the third busiest Brazilian airport based on passengers and aircraft movements.[76] Because of its strategic location it is a civil aviation hub for the rest of the country. This results in a large number of takeoffs and landings and it is not unusual for flights to be delayed in a holding pattern before landing. Following the airport's master plan, Infraero built a second runway, which was finished in 2006. In 2007, the airport handled 11,119,872 passengers.[76] The main building's third floor, with 12 thousand square meters, has a panoramic deck, a food court, shops, four movie theaters with total capacity of 500 people, and space for exhibitions. Brasilia Airport has 136 vendor spaces. The airport is located about 11 km (6.8 mi) from the central area of Brasilia, outside the metro system. The area outside the airport's main gate is lined with taxis as well as several bus line services that connect the airport to Brasilia's central district. The parking lot accommodates 1,200 cars.[77]\n\n\nThe airport is serviced by domestic and regional airlines (TAM, GOL, Azul, WebJET, Trip and Avianca), in addition to a number of international carriers. In 2012, Brasilia's International Airport was won by the InfraAmerica consortium, formed by the Brazilian engineering company ENGEVIX and the Argentine Corporacion America holding company, with a 50% stake each.[78] During the 25-year concession, the airport may be expanded to up to 40 million passengers a year.[79]\n\n\nIn 2014 the airport received 15 new boarding bridges, totaling 28 in all. This was the main requirement made by the federal government, which transferred the operation of the terminal to the Inframerica Group after an auction. The group invested R$750 million in the project. In the same year, the number of parking spaces doubled, reaching three thousand. The airport's entrance has a new rooftop cover and a new access road. Furthermore, a VIP room was created on Terminal 1's third floor. The investments resulted an increase the capacity of Brasilia's airport from approximately 15 million passengers per year to 21 million by 2014.[80] Brasília Air Force Base - ALA1, one of their most important bases of the Brazilian Air Force, is located in Brasília.\n\n\n\n### Road transport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Juscelino Kubitschek Bridge\nLike most Brazilian cities, Brasilia has a good network of taxi companies. Taxis from the airport are available outside the terminal, but at times there can be quite a queue of people. Although the airport is not far from the downtown area, taxi prices do seem to be higher than in other Brazilian cities. Booking in advance can be advantageous, particularly if time is limited, and local companies should be able to assist airport transfer or transport requirements.\n\n\nThe Juscelino Kubitschek bridge, also known as the 'President JK Bridge' or the 'JK Bridge', crosses Lake Paranoá in Brasilia. It is named after Juscelino Kubitschek, former president of Brazil. It was designed by architect Alexandre Chan and structural engineer Mário Vila Verde. Chan won the Gustav Lindenthal Medal[81] for this project at the 2003 International Bridge Conference in Pittsburgh due to \"...outstanding achievement demonstrating harmony with the environment, aesthetic merit and successful community participation\". It consists of three 60 m (200 ft) tall asymmetrical steel arches that crisscross diagonally. With a length of 1,200 m (0.75 miles), it was completed in 2002 at a cost of US$56.8 million. The bridge has a pedestrian walkway and is accessible to bicyclists and skaters.\n\n\n\n![](image)Central Bus Station\nThe main bus hub in Brasilia is the Central Bus Station, located in the crossing of the Eixo Monumental and the Eixão, about 2 km (1.2 mi) from the Three Powers Plaza. The original plan was to have a bus station as near as possible to every corner of Brasilia. Today, the bus station is the hub of urban buses only, some running within Brasilia and others connecting Brasilia to the satellite cities. In the original city plan, the interstate buses would also stop at the Central Station. Because of the growth of Brasilia (and corresponding growth in the bus fleet), today the interstate buses leave from the older interstate station (called Rodoferroviária) located at the western end of the Eixo Monumental. The Central Bus Station also contains a main metro station. A new bus station was opened in July 2010. It is on Saída Sul (South Exit) near Parkshopping Mall with its metro station, and is also an inter-state bus station, used only to leave the Federal District.\n\n\n\n### Metro[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Federal District Metro\nThere is no passenger rail service in Brasilia, but the Expresso Pequi rail line is planned to link Brasilia and Goiânia. A 22 km light rail line is planned, estimated to cost between 1 billion reais (US$258 million) and 1.5 billion reais with capacity to transport around 200,000 passengers per day.[82]\n\n\nThe Federal District Metro is Federal District's underground metro system. The system has 24 stations on two lines, the Orange and Green lines, along a total network of 43 km (27 mi), covering some of the Federal District. Both lines begin at the Central Station and run parallel until the Águas Claras Station. The Federal District Metro is not comprehensive so buses may provide better access to the center. The metro leaves the Rodoviária (bus station) and goes south, avoiding most of the political and tourist areas. The main purpose of the metro is to serve cities, such as Samambaia, Taguatinga and Ceilândia, as well as Guará and Águas Claras. The satellite cities served are more populated in total than the Plano Piloto itself (the census of 2000 indicated that Ceilândia had 344,039 inhabitants, Taguatinga had 243,575, and the Plano Piloto had approximately 400,000 inhabitants), and most residents of the satellite cities depend on public transportation.[83]\n\n\nA high-speed railway was planned between Brasilia and Goiânia, the capital of the state of Goias, but it will probably be turned into a regional service linking the capital cities and cities in between, like Anápolis and Alexânia.[84]\n\n\n\n## Sport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Estádio Nacional de Brasilia\nThe main stadiums are the Brasilia National Stadium Mané Garrincha (which was re-inaugurated on 18 May 2013), the Serejão Stadium (home for Brasiliense) and the Bezerrão Stadium (home for Gama).\n\n\nBrasilia was one of the host cities of the 2014 FIFA World Cup and 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, for which Brazil is the host nation. Brasilia hosted the opening of the Confederations Cup and hosted 7 World Cup games.[85] Brasilia also hosted the football tournaments during the 2016 Summer Olympics held in Rio de Janeiro.\n\n\n\n![](image)Nilson Nelson Gymnasium\nBrasilia is known as a departing point for the practice of unpowered air sports, sports that may be practiced with hang gliding or paragliding wings. Practitioners of such sports reveal that, because of the city's dry weather, the city offers strong thermal winds and great \"cloud-streets\", which is also the name for a maneuver quite appreciated by practitioners. In 2003, Brasilia hosted the 14th Hang Gliding World Championship, one of the categories of free flying. In August 2005, the city hosted the second stage of the Brazilian Hang Gliding Championship.\n\n\nBrasilia is the site of the Autódromo Internacional Nelson Piquet which hosted a non-championship round of the 1974 Formula One Grand Prix season. An IndyCar race was cancelled at the last minute in 2015. The track, which has been closed since 2015, is being renovated for the end of 2023.\n\n\nThe city is also home to Uniceub BRB, one of Brazil's best basketball clubs, who became NBB champion in 2010, 2011 and 2012. The club hosts some of its games at the 16,000 all-seat Nilson Nelson Gymnasium.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Brazil portal\n* ![map](image)Latin America portal\n* ![icon](image)Geography portal\n\n\n* List of purpose-built national capitals\n\n\n**Purpose-built Brazilian state capitals**\n\n\n\n* Aracaju\n* Belo Horizonte\n* Boa Vista\n* Palmas\n* Teresina\n\n\n## Explanatory notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The administrative region of Brasília recorded a population of 214,529 in a 2012 survey; IBGE demographic publications do not make this distinction and considers the entire population of the Federal District.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** IBGE: Brasília Archived 17 October 2013 at the Wayback Machine IBGE.

Brasília was not, in fact, planned in any meaningful way. The Brazilian architect and planner Lúcio Costa's entry for the design competition for the new city in 1956 was a series of sketches of ideal urban forms of communal apartment blocks loosely based on Le Corbusier's Ville Radieuse of 1935, and 'superblocks' of single-family houses based on the North American Radburn layout (1929). He subsequently elaborated these into the Plano Piloto (Pilot Plan), and added the satellite city of Taguatinga.\n18. **^** Peter William Kellett; Felipe Hernández; Lea Knudsen Allen, eds.

It is Brazil's 4th largest city, the city has passed Salvador in 2023 census with a population of slightly over 2.7 million, and the 12th largest city by gross domestic product. It forms the core of the Fortaleza metropolitan area, which is home to over 4.1 million people. \n\n\nFortaleza is an important industrial and commercial center of Northeast Brazil. According to the Ministry of Tourism, it is the fourth most visited city and tourist destination in the country. The BR-116, the most important highway of the country, starts in Fortaleza. The municipality is part of the Mercosur common market, and vital trade port which is closest to mainland Europe, being 5,608 kilometres (3,485 mi) from Lisbon, Portugal.[3][4]\n\n\nTo the north of the city lies the Atlantic Ocean; to the south are the municipalities of Pacatuba, Eusébio, Maracanaú and Itaitinga; to the east is the municipality of Aquiraz and the Atlantic Ocean; and to the west is the municipality of Caucaia. Residents of the city are known as *Fortalezenses*. Fortaleza is one of the three leading cities in the Northeast region together with Recife and Salvador.[4][5]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Colonial period[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Timeline of Fortaleza and History of Brazil\n\n![](image)Plan of Fort Schoonenborch in 1649\nColonisation began in 1603 when Portugal was part of the Iberian Union, when the Portuguese Pero Coelho de Souza constructed the Fort of São Tiago and founded the settlement of *Nova Lisboa* (New Lisbon).[*citation needed*] After a victory over the French in 1612, Martins Soares Moreno expanded the Fort of São Tiago and changed its name to Forte de São Sebastião.[6]\n\n\nIn 1630 the Dutch invaded the Brazilian Northeast and in 1637 they took the Fort of São Sebastião and ruled over Ceará. In battles with the Portuguese and natives in 1644 the fort was destroyed.[6] Under captain Matthias Beck the Dutch West Indies Company built a new fortress by the banks of river Pajeú. Fort *Schoonenborch* (\"graceful stronghold\") officially opened on August 19, 1649. After the capitulation of Pernambuco in 1654, the Dutch handed over this fortress to the Portuguese, who renamed it *Fortaleza da Nossa Senhora de Assunção* (\"Fort of Our Lady of the Assumption\"), after which the city of Fortaleza takes its name.[7]\n\n\nFortaleza was officially founded as a village 1726, becoming the capital of Ceará state in 1799.[8]\n\n\n\n### Imperial period[edit]\n\n\nDuring the 19th century, Fortaleza was consolidated as an urban centre in Ceará, supported by the cotton industry. With the transformation of the city into a regional export center and with the increase of direct navigation to Europe, the customs building of Fortaleza was built in 1812. In 1824, the city was targeted by the revolutionaries of Confederation of the Equator.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Republican period[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ferreira Square in 1920\n![](image)Fortaleza in 1935\nThe city gained a number of new districts in the 1930s, including Messejana and Porangaba.[9]\nIn 1954, the first university in the city was created, the Universidade Federal do Ceará (UFC).[10]\n\n\nIn 1983 the city started to integrate the territory of the new city of Maracanaú, which, just some years ago, was made again part of the Greater Fortaleza (the city's Metropolitan area). In the 1980s, Fortaleza exceeded Recife in population terms, becoming the second most populous city in Northeastern Brazil, with 2,571,896 inhabitants.[11]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nFortaleza has a typical tropical climate, specifically a tropical wet and dry climate (Köppen climate classification: *Aw/As*), with high temperatures and relative humidity throughout the year. However, these conditions are usually relieved by pleasant winds blowing from the ocean. Average temperatures are not much different throughout the year. December is the warmest month, with a high of 31.7 °C (89.1 °F) and low of 24.9 °C (76.8 °F). The rainy season spans from January to July, with rainfall particularly prodigious in March and April. The average annual temperature is 27.0 °C (80.6 °F). The relative humidity in Fortaleza is 77.5%, with average annual rainfall of 1,584.0 millimetres (62.36 in). There is usually rain during the first seven months of the year from January to July. During this period, relative humidity is high. Fortaleza's climate is usually very dry from August to December, with very little rainfall.[12]\n\n\nRainfall is akin to all of Northeastern Brazil among the most variable in the world, comparable (for similar average annual rainfalls) to central Queensland cities such as Townsville and Mackay.[13] In the notorious drought year of 1877 as little as 468 millimetres or 18.43 inches fell, and in 1958 only 518 millimetres or 20.39 inches, but in the Nordeste's record wet year of 1985 Fortaleza received 2,841 millimetres or 111.85 inches.\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Fortaleza (1991–2020 normals, extremes 1931–present)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 35.2(95.4)\n | 35.2(95.4)\n | 34.8(94.6)\n | 34.9(94.8)\n | 33.6(92.5)\n | 33.8(92.8)\n | 33.9(93.0)\n | 34.4(93.9)\n | 34.6(94.3)\n | 34.8(94.6)\n | 34.8(94.6)\n | 35.2(95.4)\n | 35.2(95.4)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 31.2(88.2)\n | 31.1(88.0)\n | 30.8(87.4)\n | 30.6(87.1)\n | 30.8(87.4)\n | 30.5(86.9)\n | 30.6(87.1)\n | 31.1(88.0)\n | 31.4(88.5)\n | 31.6(88.9)\n | 31.7(89.1)\n | 31.7(89.1)\n | 31.1(88.0)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 27.4(81.3)\n | 27.3(81.1)\n | 27.0(80.6)\n | 26.8(80.2)\n | 26.8(80.2)\n | 26.4(79.5)\n | 26.2(79.2)\n | 26.6(79.9)\n | 27.0(80.6)\n | 27.4(81.3)\n | 27.7(81.9)\n | 27.8(82.0)\n | 27.0(80.6)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 24.5(76.1)\n | 24.3(75.7)\n | 23.9(75.0)\n | 23.8(74.8)\n | 23.8(74.8)\n | 23.2(73.8)\n | 22.8(73.0)\n | 22.9(73.2)\n | 23.6(74.5)\n | 24.3(75.7)\n | 24.7(76.5)\n | 24.9(76.8)\n | 23.9(75.0)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | 18.2(64.8)\n | 19(66)\n | 18(64)\n | 18.8(65.8)\n | 18.6(65.5)\n | 17.9(64.2)\n | 17.9(64.2)\n | 17.7(63.9)\n | 19.2(66.6)\n | 20.3(68.5)\n | 20(68)\n | 19.4(66.9)\n | 17.7(63.9)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 156.4(6.16)\n | 187.0(7.36)\n | 336.9(13.26)\n | 385.0(15.16)\n | 229.0(9.02)\n | 130.0(5.12)\n | 69.7(2.74)\n | 20.0(0.79)\n | 13.6(0.54)\n | 9.5(0.37)\n | 9.8(0.39)\n | 37.1(1.46)\n | 1,584(62.36)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 1.0 mm) | 13\n | 14\n | 20\n | 21\n | 16\n | 10\n | 7\n | 3\n | 3\n | 3\n | 3\n | 5\n | 118\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 78.4\n | 80.4\n | 83.0\n | 85.1\n | 82.6\n | 79.9\n | 76.9\n | 73.3\n | 71.7\n | 72.0\n | 72.7\n | 74.4\n | 77.5\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 220.4\n | 183.0\n | 172.7\n | 152.8\n | 211.9\n | 219.2\n | 254.2\n | 288.5\n | 287.1\n | 294.2\n | 287.7\n | 274.2\n | 2,845.9\n |\n| Source: Brazilian National Institute of Meteorology (INMET)[12][14][15] |\n\n### Vegetation[edit]\n\n\nIn Fortaleza there are some remaining areas of mangrove in preserved areas, including Cocó Park.[16][17]\nTen miles offshore is the Pedra da Risca do Meio Marine State Park, created in 1997 to protect the reefs.[18]\n\n\n\n### Ecology and environment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cocó Park, considered one of the largest urban parks in Latin America, is the most important green area of the city.\nThe vegetation of Fortaleza is typically coastal.

In battles with the Portuguese and natives in 1644 the fort was destroyed.[6] Under captain Matthias Beck the Dutch West Indies Company built a new fortress by the banks of river Pajeú. Fort *Schoonenborch* (\"graceful stronghold\") officially opened on August 19, 1649. After the capitulation of Pernambuco in 1654, the Dutch handed over this fortress to the Portuguese, who renamed it *Fortaleza da Nossa Senhora de Assunção* (\"Fort of Our Lady of the Assumption\"), after which the city of Fortaleza takes its name.[7]\n\n\nFortaleza was officially founded as a village 1726, becoming the capital of Ceará state in 1799.[8]\n\n\n\n### Imperial period[edit]\n\n\nDuring the 19th century, Fortaleza was consolidated as an urban centre in Ceará, supported by the cotton industry. With the transformation of the city into a regional export center and with the increase of direct navigation to Europe, the customs building of Fortaleza was built in 1812. In 1824, the city was targeted by the revolutionaries of Confederation of the Equator.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Republican period[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ferreira Square in 1920\n![](image)Fortaleza in 1935\nThe city gained a number of new districts in the 1930s, including Messejana and Porangaba.[9]\nIn 1954, the first university in the city was created, the Universidade Federal do Ceará (UFC).[10]\n\n\nIn 1983 the city started to integrate the territory of the new city of Maracanaú, which, just some years ago, was made again part of the Greater Fortaleza (the city's Metropolitan area). In the 1980s, Fortaleza exceeded Recife in population terms, becoming the second most populous city in Northeastern Brazil, with 2,571,896 inhabitants.[11]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nFortaleza has a typical tropical climate, specifically a tropical wet and dry climate (Köppen climate classification: *Aw/As*), with high temperatures and relative humidity throughout the year. However, these conditions are usually relieved by pleasant winds blowing from the ocean. Average temperatures are not much different throughout the year. December is the warmest month, with a high of 31.7 °C (89.1 °F) and low of 24.9 °C (76.8 °F). The rainy season spans from January to July, with rainfall particularly prodigious in March and April.
