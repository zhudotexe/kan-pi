It is one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council and a founding member of several multilateral and regional organizations such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the Silk Road Fund, the New Development Bank, and the RCEP. It is also a member of the BRICS, the G20, APEC, and the East Asia Summit. China ranks poorly in measures of democracy, transparency, and human rights, including for press freedom, religious freedom, and ethnic equality. Making up around one-fifth of the world economy, China is the world's largest economy by GDP at purchasing power parity, the second-largest economy by nominal GDP, and the second-wealthiest country. The country is one of the fastest-growing major economies and is the world's largest manufacturer and exporter, as well as the second-largest importer. China is a nuclear-weapon state with the world's largest standing army by military personnel and the second-largest defense budget.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Diplomatic relations of China\nThe PRC has diplomatic relations with 179 United Nation members states and maintains embassies in 174.

Meanwhile, the *CIA World Factbook* states that China's total area was greater than that of the United States until the coastal waters of the Great Lakes was added to the United States' total area in 1996. From 1989 through 1996, the total area of US was listed as 9,372,610\u00a0km2 (3,618,780\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) (land area plus inland water only). The listed total area changed to 9,629,091\u00a0km2 (3,717,813\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in 1997 (with the Great Lakes areas and the coastal waters added), to 9,631,418\u00a0km2 (3,718,711\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in 2004, to 9,631,420\u00a0km2 (3,718,710\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in 2006, and to 9,826,630\u00a0km2 (3,794,080\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in 2007 (territorial waters added).\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Map showing the territorial claims of the PRC\nThe People's Republic of China is the second-largest country in the world by land area after Russia,[u] and the third or fourth largest country in the world by total area.[v] China's total area is generally stated as being approximately 9,600,000\u00a0km2 (3,700,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[197] Specific area figures range from 9,572,900\u00a0km2 (3,696,100\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) according to the *Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica*,[198] to 9,596,961\u00a0km2 (3,705,407\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) according to the *UN Demographic Yearbook*,[3] and *The World Factbook*.[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n13. **^** The total area ranking relative to the United States depends on the measurement of the total areas of both countries. See List of countries and dependencies by area for more information.\n\nThe following two primary sources (non-mirrored) represent the range (min./max.) of estimates of China's and the United States' total areas.\n\nBoth sources (1) *exclude* Taiwan from the area of China; (2) *exclude* China's coastal and territorial waters.\n\nHowever, the CIA *World Factbook* *includes* the United States coastal and territorial waters, while Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica *excludes* the United States coastal and territorial waters.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn other words, *no* coastal or territorial water area was added to China's total area figure. The United States has a coastal water area of 109,362\u00a0km2 (42,225\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), and a territorial water area of 195,213\u00a0km2 (75,372\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), for a total of 304,575\u00a0km2 (117,597\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of additional water space. This is larger than entire countries like Italy, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Adding this figure to the U.S. will boost it over China in ranking since China's coastal and territorial water figures are currently unknown (no official publication) and thus cannot be added into China's total area figure.\n14. **^** The PRC claims the territories controlled by the ROC (Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu), which it does not control, as its disputed 23rd province, Taiwan Province. See \u00a7\u00a0Administrative divisions for more details.\n15. **^** \"...\u00a0Next into this, is found the great China, whose king is thought to be the greatest prince in the world, and is named Santoa Raia\".[17][18]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** The area given is the official United Nations figure for the mainland and excludes Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.[3] It also excludes the Trans-Karakoram Tract (5,180\u00a0km2 (2,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)), Aksai Chin (38,000\u00a0km2 (15,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)) and other territories in dispute with India.

The CIA *World Factbook* lists China as the fourth-largest country (after Russia, Canada and the United States) with a total area of 9,596,960 km2,[14] and the United States as the third-largest at 9,833,517 km2.[15]\n\nNotably, the *Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica* specifies the United States' area (excluding coastal and territorial waters) as 9,525,067 km2, which is less than either source's figure given for China's area.[13] Therefore, while it can be determined that China has a larger area excluding coastal and territorial waters, it is unclear which country has a larger area including coastal and territorial waters.\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nShanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)\n |\n| --- |\n| Summits | * Beijing 2012\n* Dushanbe 2014\n* Astana 2017\n* Samarkand 2022\n |\n| Member states | * ![](image)\u00a0China\n* ![](image)\u00a0India\n* ![](image)\u00a0Iran\n* ![](image)\u00a0Kazakhstan\n* ![](image)\u00a0Kyrgyzstan\n* ![](image)\u00a0Pakistan\n* ![](image)\u00a0Russia\n* ![](image)\u00a0Tajikistan\n* ![](image)\u00a0Uzbekistan\n |\n| Observer states | * ![](image)\u00a0Afghanistan (inactive)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Belarus\n* ![](image)\u00a0Mongolia\n |\n| Dialogue partners | * ![](image)\u00a0Armenia\n* ![](image)\u00a0Azerbaijan\n* ![](image)\u00a0Bahrain\n* ![](image)\u00a0Cambodia\n* ![](image)\u00a0Egypt\n* ![](image)\u00a0Kuwait\n* ![](image)\u00a0Maldives\n* ![](image)\u00a0Myanmar\n* ![](image)\u00a0Nepal\n* ![](image)\u00a0Qatar\n* ![](image)\u00a0Saudi Arabia\n* ![](image)\u00a0Sri Lanka\n* ![](image)\u00a0Turkey\n* ![](image)\u00a0United Arab Emirates\n |\n| Guests | * ASEAN\n* Commonwealth of Independent States\n* ![](image)\u00a0Turkmenistan\n* United Nations\n |\n| Applicants | * ![](image)\u00a0Algeria\n* ![](image)\u00a0Bangladesh\n* ![](image)\u00a0East Timor\n* ![](image)\u00a0Iraq\n* ![](image)\u00a0Israel\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFurther explanation of disputed ranking: The dispute about which is the world's third-largest country arose from the inclusion of coastal and territorial waters for the United States. This discrepancy was deduced from comparing the CIA *World Factbook* and its previous iterations against the information for United States in *Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica*, particularly its footnote section.[13] In sum, according to older versions of the CIA *World Factbook* (from 1982 to 1996), the U.S. was listed as the world's fourth-largest country (after Russia, Canada, and China) with a total area of 9,372,610\u00a0km2 (3,618,780\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). However, in the 1997 edition, the U.S. added coastal waters to its total area (increasing it to 9,629,091\u00a0km2 (3,717,813\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)). And then again in 2007, U.S. added territorial water to its total area (increasing it to 9,833,517\u00a0km2 (3,796,742\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)). During this time, China's total area remained unchanged. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n100. **^** David Ernest Apter, Tony Saich (1994) *Revolutionary Discourse in Mao's Republic* Harvard University Press ISBN\u00a00-674-76780-2 p.198\n101. **^** \"Nuclear Power: The End of the War Against Japan\".

In October 1971, the PRC replaced the Republic of China in the United Nations, and took its seat as a permanent member of the Security Council.[121] This UN action also created the problem of the political status of Taiwan and the Two Chinas issue.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe PRC officially maintains the one-China principle, which holds the view that there is only one sovereign state in the name of China, represented by the PRC, and that Taiwan is part of that China.[231] The unique status of Taiwan has led to countries recognizing the PRC to maintain unique \"one-China policies\" that differ from each other; some countries explicitly recognize the PRC's claim over Taiwan, while others, including the US and Japan, only *acknowledge* the claim.[231] Chinese officials have protested on numerous occasions when foreign countries have made diplomatic overtures to Taiwan,[232] especially in the matter of armament sales.[233] Most countries have switched recognition from the ROC to the PRC since the latter replaced the former in the United Nations in 1971 as the sole representative of China.[234]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nChina has over 160 cities with a population of over one million,[494] including the 17 megacities as of 2021[update][495][496] (cities with a population of over 10 million) of Chongqing, Shanghai, Beijing, Chengdu, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Tianjin, Xi'an, Suzhou, Zhengzhou, Wuhan, Hangzhou, Linyi, Shijiazhuang, Dongguan, Qingdao and Changsha.[497] Among them, the total permanent population of Chongqing, Shanghai, Beijing and Chengdu is above 20 million.[498] Shanghai is China's most populous urban area[499][500] while Chongqing is its largest city proper, the only city in China with the largest permanent population of over 30 million.[501] By 2025, it is estimated that the country will be home to 221 cities with over a million inhabitants.[502] The figures in the table below are from the 2017 census,[503] and are only estimates of the urban populations within administrative city limits; a different ranking exists when considering the total municipal populations (which includes suburban and rural populations). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nList of administrative divisions in the PRC\n| Provinces (\u7701) | * Anhui (\u5b89\u5fbd\u7701)\n* Fujian (\u798f\u5efa\u7701)\n* Gansu (\u7518\u8083\u7701)\n* Guangdong (\u5e7f\u4e1c\u7701)\n* Guizhou (\u8d35\u5dde\u7701)\n* Hainan (\u6d77\u5357\u7701)\n* Hebei (\u6cb3\u5317\u7701)\n* Heilongjiang (\u9ed1\u9f99\u6c5f\u7701)\n* Henan (\u6cb3\u5357\u7701)\n* Hubei (\u6e56\u5317\u7701)\n* Hunan (\u6e56\u5357\u7701)\n* Jiangsu (\u6c5f\u82cf\u7701)\n* Jiangxi (\u6c5f\u897f\u7701)\n* Jilin (\u5409\u6797\u7701)\n* Liaoning (\u8fbd\u5b81\u7701)\n* Qinghai (\u9752\u6d77\u7701)\n* Shaanxi (\u9655\u897f\u7701)\n* Shandong (\u5c71\u4e1c\u7701)\n* Shanxi (\u5c71\u897f\u7701)\n* Sichuan (\u56db\u5ddd\u7701)\n* Yunnan (\u4e91\u5357\u7701)\n* Zhejiang (\u6d59\u6c5f\u7701)\n |\n| *Claimed Province* | *Taiwan* (\u53f0\u6e7e\u7701), *governed by the Republic of China*\n |\n| Autonomous regions (\u81ea\u6cbb\u533a) | * Guangxi (\u5e7f\u897f\u58ee\u65cf\u81ea\u6cbb\u533a)\n* Inner Mongolia / *Nei Menggu* (\u5185\u8499\u53e4\u81ea\u6cbb\u533a)\n* Ningxia (\u5b81\u590f\u56de\u65cf\u81ea\u6cbb\u533a)\n* Tibet / *Xizang* (\u897f\u85cf\u81ea\u6cbb\u533a)\n* Xinjiang (\u65b0\u7586\u7ef4\u543e\u5c14\u81ea\u6cbb\u533a)\n |\n| Municipalities (\u76f4\u8f96\u5e02) | * Beijing (\u5317\u4eac\u5e02)\n* Chongqing (\u91cd\u5e86\u5e02)\n* Shanghai (\u4e0a\u6d77\u5e02)\n* Tianjin (\u5929\u6d25\u5e02)\n |\n| Special administrative regions (\u7279\u522b\u884c\u653f\u533a) | * Hong Kong / *Xianggang* (\u9999\u6e2f\u7279\u522b\u884c\u653f\u533a)\n* Macau / *Aomen* (\u6fb3\u95e8\u7279\u522b\u884c\u653f\u533a)\n |\n\n\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign relations of China\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Second Sino-Japanese War (1937\u20131945), a theater of World War II, forced an uneasy alliance between the Kuomintang and the Communists. Japanese forces committed numerous war atrocities against the civilian population; in all, as many as 20 million Chinese civilians died.[101] An estimated 40,000 to 300,000 Chinese were massacred in the city of Nanjing alone during the Japanese occupation.[102] During the war, China, along with the UK, the United States, and the Soviet Union, were referred to as \"trusteeship of the powerful\"[103] and were recognized as the Allied \"Big Four\" in the Declaration by United Nations.[104][105] Along with the other three great powers, China was one of the four major Allies of World War II, and was later considered one of the primary victors in the war.[106][107] After the surrender of Japan in 1945, Taiwan, including the Pescadores, was handed over to Chinese control. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe large \"floating populations\" of migrant workers make conducting censuses in urban areas difficult;[504] the figures below include only long-term residents.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPolitical concerns in China include the growing gap between rich and poor and government corruption.[295] Nonetheless, international surveys show a high level of the Chinese public's satisfaction with their government.[216]:\u200a137 These views are generally attributed to the material comforts and security available to large segments of the Chinese populace as well as the government's attentiveness and responsiveness.[216] :\u200a136According to the World Values Survey (2017\u20132020), 95% of Chinese respondents have significant confidence in their government.[216]:\u200a13 Confidence decreased to 91% in the survey's 2022 edition.[216]:\u200a13 A Harvard University survey published in July 2020 found that citizen satisfaction with the government had increased since 2003, also rating China's government as more effective and capable than ever before in the survey's history.[296]\n\n\n\n## Military[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: People's Liberation Army and Paramilitary forces of China\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nChina is also the world's leading investor in renewable energy and its commercialization, with $546\u00a0billion invested in 2022;[192] it is a major manufacturer of renewable energy technologies and invests heavily in local-scale renewable energy projects.[193][192] In 2022, 61.2% of China's electricity came from coal (largest producer in the world), 14.9% from hydroelectric power (largest), 9.3% from wind (largest), 4.7% from solar energy (largest), 4.7% from nuclear energy (second-largest), 3.1% from natural gas (fifth-largest), and 1.9% from bioenergy (largest); in total, 30.8% of China's energy came from renewable energy sources.[194] Despite its emphasis on renewables, China remains deeply connected to global oil markets and next to India, has been the largest importer of Russian crude oil in 2022.[195][196]\n\n\n\n### Political geography[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Borders of China, Coastline of China, and Territorial changes of the People's Republic of China\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2013, China initiated the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a large global infrastructure building initiative with funding on the order of $50\u2013100 billion per year.[263] BRI could be one of the largest development plans in modern history.[264] It has expanded significantly over the last six years and, as of April\u00a02020[update], includes 138 countries and 30 international organizations. In addition to intensifying foreign policy relations, the focus here is particularly on building efficient transport routes. The focus is particularly on the maritime Silk Road with its connections to East Africa and Europe and there are Chinese investments or related declarations of intent at numerous ports such as Gwadar, Kuantan, Hambantota, Piraeus and Trieste. However many of these loans made under the Belt and Road program are unsustainable and China has faced a number of calls for debt relief from debtor nations.[265][266]\n\n\n\n#### Territorial disputes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n159. **^** Chow, Gregory (2006) Are Chinese Official Statistics Reliable?

For a larger map, see here.\nEver since its establishment, the PRC has claimed the territories governed by the Republic of China (ROC), a separate political entity today commonly known as Taiwan, as a part of its territory. It regards the island of Taiwan as its Taiwan Province, Kinmen and Matsu as a part of Fujian Province and islands the ROC controls in the South China Sea as a part of Hainan Province and Guangdong Province. These claims are controversial because of the complicated Cross-Strait relations, with the PRC treating the one-China principle as one of its most important diplomatic principles in dealing with other countries.[231]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nProvincial-level divisions of China\n |\n| --- |\n| Provinces | * Anhui\n* Fujian\n* Gansu\n* Guangdong\n* Guizhou\n* Hainan\n* Hebei\n* Heilongjiang\n* Henan\n* Hubei\n* Hunan\n* Jiangsu\n* Jiangxi\n* Jilin\n* Liaoning\n* Qinghai\n* Shaanxi\n* Shandong\n* Shanxi\n* Sichuan\n* Yunnan\n* Zhejiang\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Autonomous regions | * Guangxi\n* Inner Mongolia\n* Ningxia\n* Tibet\n* Xinjiang\n |\n| Direct-administered municipalities | * Beijing\n* Chongqing\n* Shanghai\n* Tianjin\n |\n| Special administrative regions | * Hong Kong\n* Macau\n |\n| Disputed province | * *Taiwan1*\n |\n| 1 Taiwan is claimed by the People's Republic of China but administered by the Republic of China (see political status of Taiwan).\n |\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n147. **^** Che, Chang; Chien, Amy Chang; Stevenson, Alexandra (7 December 2022). \"What Has Changed About China's 'Zero Covid' Policy\". *The New York Times*.

Since the 1960s, France has developed close ties with reunified Germany to become the most influential driving force of the EU.[154] In the 1960s, France sought to exclude the British from the European unification process,[155] seeking to build its standing in continental Europe. However, since 1904, France has maintained an \"Entente cordiale\" with the United Kingdom, and there has been a strengthening of links between the countries, especially militarily.\n\n\nFrance is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), but under President de Gaulle excluded itself from the joint military command, in protest of the Special Relationship between the United States and Britain, and to preserve the independence of French foreign and security policies. Under Nicolas Sarkozy, France rejoined the NATO joint military command on 4 April 2009.[156][157][158]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n167. **^** \"Status of signature and ratification\".

Senators are chosen by an electoral college for six-year terms, with half the seats submitted to election every three years.[130] The Senate's legislative powers are limited; in the event of disagreement between the two chambers, the National Assembly has the final say.[131] The parliament is responsible for determining the rules and principles concerning most areas of law, political amnesty, and fiscal policy; however, the government may draft specific details concerning most laws.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n10. **^** The overseas regions and collectivities form part of the French telephone numbering plan, but have their own country calling codes: Guadeloupe +590; Martinique +596; French Guiana +594; R\u00e9union and Mayotte +262; Saint Pierre and Miquelon +508.

Corsica lies off the Mediterranean coast. France has an extensive river system consisting of the four major rivers Seine, the Loire, the Garonne, the Rh\u00f4ne and their tributaries, whose combined catchment includes over 62% of the metropolitan territory. The Rh\u00f4ne divides the Massif Central from the Alps and flows into the Mediterranean Sea at the Camargue. The Garonne meets the Dordogne just after Bordeaux, forming the Gironde estuary, the largest estuary in Western Europe which after approximately 100 kilometres (62\u00a0mi) empties into the Atlantic Ocean.[90] Other water courses drain towards the Meuse and Rhine along the northeastern borders.

Its land borders consist of Belgium and Luxembourg in the northeast, Germany and Switzerland in the east, Italy and Monaco in the southeast, and Andorra and Spain in the south and southwest. Except for the northeast, most of France's land borders are roughly delineated by natural boundaries and geographic features: to the south and southeast, the Pyrenees and the Alps and the Jura, respectively, and to the east, the Rhine river. Due to its shape, France is often referred to as **l'Hexagone** (\"The Hexagon\").

This rebellion was driven by the great feudal lords and sovereign courts as a reaction to the rise of royal absolute power in France. The monarchy reached its peak during the 17th century and the reign of Louis XIV. By turning powerful feudal lords into courtiers at the Palace of Versailles, his command of the military went unchallenged.

Eventually Joseph Stalin, the General Secretary of the Communist Party, managed to suppress all opposition factions and consolidate power in his hands to become the country's dictator by the 1930s.[121] Leon Trotsky, the main proponent of world revolution, was exiled from the Soviet Union in 1929,[122] and Stalin's idea of Socialism in One Country became the official line.[123] The continued internal struggle in the Bolshevik party culminated in the Great Purge.[124]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Russia\n\n![](image)Topographic map of Russia\nRussia's vast landmass stretches over the easternmost part of Europe and the northernmost part of Asia.[218] It spans the northernmost edge of Eurasia; and has the world's fourth-longest coastline, of over 37,653\u00a0km (23,396\u00a0mi).[e][220] Russia lies between latitudes 41\u00b0 and 82\u00b0 N, and longitudes 19\u00b0 E and 169\u00b0 W, extending some 9,000\u00a0km (5,600\u00a0mi) east to west, and 2,500 to 4,000\u00a0km (1,600 to 2,500\u00a0mi) north to south.[221] Russia, by landmass, is larger than three continents,[f] and has the same surface area as Pluto.[222]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRussia, as one of the world's only three countries bordering three oceans,[218] has links with a great number of seas.[g][227] Its major islands and archipelagos include Novaya Zemlya, Franz Josef Land, Severnaya Zemlya, the New Siberian Islands, Wrangel Island, the Kuril Islands (four of which are disputed with Japan), and Sakhalin.[228][229] The Diomede Islands, administered by Russia and the United States, are just 3.8\u00a0km (2.4\u00a0mi) apart;[230] and Kunashir Island of the Kuril Islands is merely 20\u00a0km (12.4\u00a0mi) from Hokkaido, Japan.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The Moscow International Business Centre in Moscow.

The large service sector accounts for 62% of total GDP, followed by the industrial sector (32%), while the agricultural sector is the smallest, making up only 5% of total GDP.[10] Russia has a low official unemployment rate of 4.1%.[351] Its foreign exchange reserves are the world's fifth-largest, worth $540 billion.[352] It has a labour force of roughly 70 million, which is the world's sixth-largest.[353]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 8 | Chelyabinsk | Chelyabinsk Oblast | 1,177,058 | 18 | Tyumen | Tyumen Oblast | 861,098\n |\n| 9 | Ufa | Bashkortostan | 1,163,304 | 19 | Tolyatti | Samara Oblast | 667,956\n |\n| 10 | Samara | Samara Oblast | 1,158,952 | 20 | Makhachkala | Dagestan | 622,091\n |\n\n### Language[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Russian language and Languages of Russia\n\nMinority languages across Russia\n![](image)\nAltaic and Uralic languages spoken across Russia\n![](image)\nThe North Caucasus is ethno-linguistically diverse.[467]\n\nRussian is the official and the predominantly spoken language in Russia.[3] It is the most spoken native language in Europe, the most geographically widespread language of Eurasia, as well as the world's most widely spoken Slavic language.[468] Russian is one of two official languages aboard the International Space Station,[469] as well as one of the six official languages of the United Nations.[468]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRussia is a multinational state with many subnational entities associated with different minorities.[459] There are over 193 ethnic groups nationwide.

In mid-2014 and mid-2015 net long-term international migration contributed more to population growth. In mid-2012 and mid-2013 natural change contributed the most to population growth.[312] Between 2001 and 2011 the population increased by an average annual rate of approximately 0.7 per cent.[311] The 2011 census also showed that, over the previous 100 years, the proportion of the population aged 0\u201314 fell from 31 per cent to 18 per cent, and the proportion of people aged 65 and over rose from 5 to 16 per cent.[311] In 2018 the median age of the UK population was 41.7 years.[313]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNotwithstanding substantial differences among the schemes, an important common factor is that the UK Parliament has not renounced legislative sovereignty in relation to the three nations concerned. For example, the Scottish Parliament is empowered to enact primary legislation on all matters, save those in relation to which competence is explicitly denied\u00a0... but this power to legislate on what may be termed \"devolved matters\" is concurrent with the Westminster Parliament's general power to legislate for Scotland on any matter at all, including devolved matters\u00a0... In theory, therefore, Westminster may legislate on Scottish devolved matters whenever it chooses...\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the decades-long process of European integration, the UK was a founding member of the Western European Union, established with the London and Paris Conferences in 1954. In 1960 the UK was one of the seven founding members of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), but in 1973 it left to join the European Communities (EC). In a 1975 referendum 67% voted to stay in it.[113] When the EC became the European Union (EU) in 1992, the UK was one of the 12 founding member states.\n\n\nFrom the late 1960s, Northern Ireland suffered communal and paramilitary violence (sometimes affecting other parts of the UK) conventionally known as the Troubles. It is usually considered to have ended with the 1998 Belfast \"Good Friday\" Agreement.[114]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy.[n][25] The capital and largest city of the United Kingdom (as well as the capital of England) is London. The cities of Edinburgh, Cardiff, and Belfast are respectively the national capitals of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Other major cities include Birmingham, Manchester, Glasgow, and Leeds.[26] The UK consists of three distinct legal jurisdictions: England and Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. This is due to these areas retaining their existing legal systems even after joining the UK.[27] Since 1998, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland also have their own devolved governments and legislatures, each with varying powers.[28]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Crown Dependencies are possessions of the Crown, as opposed to territories of the UK.[222] They comprise three independently administered jurisdictions: the Bailiwicks of Jersey and of Guernsey in the English Channel, and the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea. By mutual agreement, the British Government manages the islands' foreign affairs and defence and the UK Parliament has the authority to legislate on their behalf. Internationally, they are regarded as \"territories for which the United Kingdom is responsible\".[223] The power to pass legislation affecting the islands ultimately rests with their own respective legislative assemblies, with the assent of the Crown (Privy Council or, in the case of the Isle of Man, in certain circumstances the Lieutenant-Governor).[224] Since 2005, each Crown dependency has had a Chief Minister as its head of government.[225]\n\n\n\n### Law and criminal justice[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Law of the United Kingdom, Censorship in the United Kingdom, and Crime in the United Kingdom\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Links to related articles\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nCountries, territories and dependencies of the British Crown\n |\n| --- |\n| Constituent countries of the United Kingdom | * England\n* Northern Ireland\n* Scotland\n* Wales\n |\n| Crown Dependencies | * Bailiwick of Guernsey\n\t+ Alderney\n\t+ Guernsey\n\t+ Sark\n* Bailiwick of Jersey\n* Isle of Man\n |\n| Overseas territories | * Akrotiri and Dhekelia1\n* Anguilla\n* Bermuda\n* *British Antarctic Territory*2\n* British Indian Ocean Territory\n* British Virgin Islands\n* Cayman Islands\n* Falkland Islands\n* Gibraltar\n* Montserrat\n* Pitcairn, Henderson, Ducie and Oeno Islands\n* Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha\n\t+ Ascension Island\n\t+ Saint Helena\n\t+ Tristan da Cunha\n\t\t- Gough Island\n* South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands\n* Turks and Caicos Islands\n |\n| Former colonies | * List of countries that have gained independence from the United Kingdom\n |\n| 1 Sovereign Base Areas. 2 Partial suspension of sovereignty due to the Antarctic Treaty.\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAround the end of the 20th century, there were major changes to the governance of the UK with the establishment of devolved administrations for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.[117] The statutory incorporation followed acceptance of the European Convention on Human Rights.

The upper-tier subdivisions of England are the nine regions, now used primarily for statistical purposes.[188] One of the regions, Greater London, has had a directly elected assembly and mayor since 2000 following popular support for the proposal in a 1998 referendum.[189]\n\n\nLocal government in Scotland is divided into 32 council areas with a wide variation in size and population. The cities of Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee are separate council areas, as is the Highland Council, which includes a third of Scotland's area but only just over 200,000\u00a0people. Local councils are made up of elected councillors, of whom there are 1,223.[190]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSince 1999, Scotland has had a devolved national government and legislature called the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish Government and Parliament have wide-ranging powers over any matter that has not been specifically reserved to the UK Parliament, including education, healthcare, Scots law and local government.[194] Their power over economic issues is significantly constrained by an act of the UK parliament passed in 2020.[202] The current Scottish Government is a Scottish National Party and Scottish Greens coalition, led by First Minister Humza Yousaf, leader of the Scottish National Party. In 2014, the Scottish independence referendum was held, with 55.3% voting against independence from the United Kingdom and 44.7% voting in favour, resulting in Scotland staying within the United Kingdom.

The UK Internal Market Act gives ministers sweeping powers to enforce mutual recognition and non-discrimination across the four jurisdictions. Existing differences and some social and health matters are exempted but these are much less extensive than the exemptions permitted under the EU Internal Market provisions. Only after an amendment in the House of Lords, the Bill was amended to provide a weak and non-binding consent mechanism for amendments (equivalent to the Sewel Convention) to the list of exemptions. The result is that, while the devolved governments retain regulatory competences, these are undermined by the fact that goods and services originating in, or imported into, England can be marketed anywhere.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe United Kingdom has evolved from a series of annexations, unions and separations of constituent countries over several hundred years. The Treaty of Union between the Kingdom of England (which included Wales) and the Kingdom of Scotland in 1707 resulted in their unification to become the Kingdom of Great Britain. Its union in 1801 with the Kingdom of Ireland created the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Most of Ireland seceded from the UK in 1922, leaving the present United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which formally adopted its name in 1927.[m] The nearby Isle of Man, Guernsey and Jersey are not part of the UK, being Crown Dependencies, but the British government is responsible for their defence and international representation.[18]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Union Jack flags on The Mall, London\nThe flag of the United Kingdom is the Union Flag (also referred to as the Union Jack).[471] It was created in 1606 by the superimposition of the flag of England, representing Saint George, on the flag of Scotland, representing Saint Andrew, and was updated in 1801 with the addition of Saint Patrick's Flag.[472] Wales is not represented in the Union Flag, as Wales had been conquered and annexed to England prior to the formation of the United Kingdom. The possibility of redesigning the Union Flag to include representation of Wales has not been completely ruled out.[473] The national anthem of the United Kingdom is \"God Save the King\", with \"King\" replaced with \"Queen\" in the lyrics whenever the monarch is a woman.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs of 2022, the United Kingdom is ranked 2nd out of 180 countries in the Environmental Performance Index.[149] A law has been passed that UK greenhouse gas emissions will be net zero by 2050.[150]\n\n\n\n### Topography[edit]\n\n\nEngland accounts for 53 per cent of the UK, covering 50,350 square miles (130,395\u00a0km2).[151] Most of the country consists of lowland terrain,[152] with upland and mountainous terrain northwest of the Tees\u2013Exe line which roughly divides the UK into lowland and upland areas. Lowland areas include Cornwall, the New Forest, the South Downs and the Norfolk Broads. Upland areas include the Lake District, the Pennines, the Yorkshire Dales, Exmoor, and Dartmoor. The main rivers and estuaries are the Thames, Severn, and the Humber. England's highest mountain is Scafell Pike, at 978 metres (3,209\u00a0ft) in the Lake District; its largest island is the Isle of Wight.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2023, the UK had 9 nuclear reactors normally generating about 15 per cent of the UK's electricity.[301] Unlike Germany and Japan, there are two reactors under construction and more planned.[302][303] In the late 1990s, nuclear power plants contributed around 25 per cent of the total annual electricity generation in the UK, but this has gradually declined as old plants have been shut down. The UK government is investing in Small Modular Reactors and Advanced Modular Reactors research and development.\n\n\nIn 2021, the UK produced 935\u00a0thousand barrels per day (bbl/d) of oil (and other liquids) and consumed 1,258\u00a0thousand bbl/d.[296] Production is now in decline and the UK has been a net importer of oil since 2005.[304] In 2020[update], the UK had around 2\u00a0billion barrels of proven crude oil reserves.[304]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2021, the UK was the 21st-largest producer of natural gas in the world.[305] Production is now in decline and the UK has been a net importer of natural gas since 2004.[305] In 2020, the UK produced 1.8\u00a0million tonnes of coal falling 91% in 10 years.[301] In 2020 it had proven recoverable coal reserves of 26 million tonnes.[301] The UK Coal Authority has stated that there is a potential to produce between 7\u00a0billion tonnes and 16\u00a0billion tonnes of coal through underground coal gasification (UCG) or 'fracking',[306] and based on current UK coal consumption, such reserves could last between 200 and 400 years.[307]\n\n\n\n### Water supply and sanitation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Water supply and sanitation in the United Kingdom\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n17. **^** For instance, the monarch alone appoints the prime minister and confers state honours in the personal gift of the Crown.
