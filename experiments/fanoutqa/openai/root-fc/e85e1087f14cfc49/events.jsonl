the greatest benefit to Mankind.\" Additionally, the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel was established by Sveriges Riksbank in 1968 and awarded to a \"person or persons in the field of economic sciences who have produced work of outstanding importance.\"\n\n\nAs of 2023, 65 Nobel Prizes and the Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences have been awarded to 64 women.[1][3] Unique Nobel Prize laureates include 894 men, 60 women, and 27 organizations.[4]\n\n\nThe distribution of Nobel prizes awarded to women is as follows:\n\n\n\n* nineteen women have won the Nobel Peace Prize (16.3% of 110 awarded);[5]\n* seventeen have won the Nobel Prize in Literature (14.28% of 119 awarded);[6]\n* thirteen have won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (5.6% of 230 awarded);[7]\n* eight have won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry (4.1% of 191 awarded);[8]\n* five have won the Nobel Prize in Physics (1.8% of 224 awarded);[9]\n* and three (Elinor Ostrom, Esther Duflo and Claudia Goldin) have won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (2.17% of 92 awarded).[10]\n\n\nThe first woman to win a Nobel Prize was Marie Curie, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903 with her husband, Pierre Curie, and Henri Becquerel.[11][12] Curie is also the first person and the only woman to have won multiple Nobel Prizes; in 1911, she won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Curie's daughter, Irène Joliot-Curie, won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1935, making the two the only mother–daughter pair to have won Nobel Prizes.[11]\n\n\nThe most Nobel Prizes awarded to women in a single year was in 2009, when five women became laureates in four categories.\n\n\nThe most recent women to be awarded a Nobel Prize were Claudia Goldin in Economics, Narges Mohammadi for Peace, Anne L'Huillier in Physics and Katalin Karikó in Physiology or Medicine (2023), Annie Ernaux in Literature and Carolyn R. Bertozzi for Chemistry (2022), Maria Ressa for Peace (2021), Louise Glück in Literature, Andrea M. Ghez in Physics, Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer A. Doudna in Chemistry (2020), and Esther Duflo in Economics (2019).\n\n\n\n\n## Female laureates[edit]\n\n\n* Physiology or Medicine\n* Physics\n* Chemistry\n* Literature\n* Peace\n* Economic Sciences\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Physiology or Medicine** |\n| No.\n | Year\n | Laureate\n | Name\n | Born\n | Died\n | Rationale\n |\n| 1\n | 1947\n | ![](image) | Gerty Radnitz-Cori | 15 August 1896 Prague, ![](image) Austria-Hungary | 26 October 1957 Glendale, Missouri, ![](image) United States | \"\"for their discovery of the course of the catalytic conversion of glycogen.\"[13](shared with Carl Ferdinand Cori and Bernardo Houssay) |\n| 2\n | 1977\n | ![](image) | Rosalyn Yalow | 19 July 1921 New York City, New York, ![](image) United States | 30 May 2011 The Bronx, New York, ![](image) United States | \"for the development of radioimmunoassays of peptide hormones.\"[14](shared with Roger Guillemin and Andrew Schally) |\n| 3\n | 1983\n | ![](image) | Barbara McClintock | 16 June 1902 Hartford, Connecticut, ![](image) United States | 2 September 1992 Huntington, New York, ![](image) United States | \"for her discovery of mobile genetic elements.\"[15] |\n| 4\n | 1986\n | ![](image) | Rita Levi-Montalcini | 22 April 1909 Turin, ![](image) Italy | 30 December 2012 Rome, ![](image) Italy | \"for their discoveries of growth factors.\"[16](shared with Stanley Cohen) |\n| 5\n | 1988\n | ![](image) | Gertrude Belle Elion | 23 January 1918 New York City, New York, ![](image) United States | 21 February 1999 Chapel Hill, North Carolina, ![](image) United States | \"for their discoveries of important principles for drug treatment.\"[17](shared with James W.

the greatest benefit to Mankind.\" Additionally, the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel was established by Sveriges Riksbank in 1968 and awarded to a \"person or persons in the field of economic sciences who have produced work of outstanding importance.\"\n\n\nAs of 2023, 65 Nobel Prizes and the Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences have been awarded to 64 women.[1][3] Unique Nobel Prize laureates include 894 men, 60 women, and 27 organizations.[4]\n\n\nThe distribution of Nobel prizes awarded to women is as follows:\n\n\n\n* nineteen women have won the Nobel Peace Prize (16.3% of 110 awarded);[5]\n* seventeen have won the Nobel Prize in Literature (14.28% of 119 awarded);[6]\n* thirteen have won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (5.6% of 230 awarded);[7]\n* eight have won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry (4.1% of 191 awarded);[8]\n* five have won the Nobel Prize in Physics (1.8% of 224 awarded);[9]\n* and three (Elinor Ostrom, Esther Duflo and Claudia Goldin) have won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (2.17% of 92 awarded).[10]\n\n\nThe first woman to win a Nobel Prize was Marie Curie, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903 with her husband, Pierre Curie, and Henri Becquerel.[11][12] Curie is also the first person and the only woman to have won multiple Nobel Prizes; in 1911, she won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Curie's daughter, Irène Joliot-Curie, won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1935, making the two the only mother–daughter pair to have won Nobel Prizes.[11]\n\n\nThe most Nobel Prizes awarded to women in a single year was in 2009, when five women became laureates in four categories.\n\n\nThe most recent women to be awarded a Nobel Prize were Claudia Goldin in Economics, Narges Mohammadi for Peace, Anne L'Huillier in Physics and Katalin Karikó in Physiology or Medicine (2023), Annie Ernaux in Literature and Carolyn R. Bertozzi for Chemistry (2022), Maria Ressa for Peace (2021), Louise Glück in Literature, Andrea M. Ghez in Physics, Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer A. Doudna in Chemistry (2020), and Esther Duflo in Economics (2019).\n\n\n\n\n## Female laureates[edit]\n\n\n* Physiology or Medicine\n* Physics\n* Chemistry\n* Literature\n* Peace\n* Economic Sciences\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Physiology or Medicine** |\n| No.\n | Year\n | Laureate\n | Name\n | Born\n | Died\n | Rationale\n |\n| 1\n | 1947\n | ![](image) | Gerty Radnitz-Cori | 15 August 1896 Prague, ![](image) Austria-Hungary | 26 October 1957 Glendale, Missouri, ![](image) United States | \"\"for their discovery of the course of the catalytic conversion of glycogen.\"[13](shared with Carl Ferdinand Cori and Bernardo Houssay) |\n| 2\n | 1977\n | ![](image) | Rosalyn Yalow | 19 July 1921 New York City, New York, ![](image) United States | 30 May 2011 The Bronx, New York, ![](image) United States | \"for the development of radioimmunoassays of peptide hormones.\"[14](shared with Roger Guillemin and Andrew Schally) |\n| 3\n | 1983\n | ![](image) | Barbara McClintock | 16 June 1902 Hartford, Connecticut, ![](image) United States | 2 September 1992 Huntington, New York, ![](image) United States | \"for her discovery of mobile genetic elements.\"[15] |\n| 4\n | 1986\n | ![](image) | Rita Levi-Montalcini | 22 April 1909 Turin, ![](image) Italy | 30 December 2012 Rome, ![](image) Italy | \"for their discoveries of growth factors.\"[16](shared with Stanley Cohen) |\n| 5\n | 1988\n | ![](image) | Gertrude Belle Elion | 23 January 1918 New York City, New York, ![](image) United States | 21 February 1999 Chapel Hill, North Carolina, ![](image) United States | \"for their discoveries of important principles for drug treatment.\"[17](shared with James W.

It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel, who died in 1896. These prizes are awarded for outstanding contributions in chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine.[1] As dictated by Nobel's will, the award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.[2] The first Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded in 1901 to Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff, of the Netherlands. Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a monetary award prize that has varied throughout the years.[3] In 1901, van 't Hoff received 150,782 SEK, which is equal to 7,731,004 SEK in December 2007. The award is presented in Stockholm at an annual ceremony on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death.[4]\n\n\nAt least 25 laureates have received the Nobel Prize for contributions in the field of organic chemistry, more than any other field of chemistry.[5] Two Nobel Prize laureates in Chemistry, Germans Richard Kuhn (1938) and Adolf Butenandt (1939), were not allowed by their government to accept the prize. They would later receive a medal and diploma, but not the money. Frederick Sanger is one out of three laureates to be awarded the Nobel Prize twice in the same subject, in 1958 and 1980. John Bardeen, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1956 and 1972, and Karl Barry Sharpless, who won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 2001 and 2022, are the others. Two others have won Nobel Prizes twice, one in chemistry and one in another subject: Maria Skłodowska-Curie (physics in 1903, chemistry in 1911) and Linus Pauling (chemistry in 1954, peace in 1962).[6] As of 2022, the prize has been awarded to 189 individuals, including eight women (Maria Skłodowska-Curie being the first to be awarded in 1911).[7]\n\n\nThere have been eight years for which the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was not awarded (1916, 1917, 1919, 1924, 1933, 1940–42). There were also nine years for which the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was delayed for one year. The Prize was not awarded in 1914, as the Nobel Committee for Chemistry decided that none of that year's nominations met the necessary criteria, but was awarded to Theodore William Richards in 1915 and counted as the 1914 prize.[8] This precedent was followed for the 1918 prize awarded to Fritz Haber in 1919,[9] the 1920 prize awarded to Walther Nernst in 1921,[10] the 1921 prize awarded to Frederick Soddy in 1922,[11] the 1925 prize awarded to Richard Zsigmondy in 1926,[12] the 1927 prize awarded to Heinrich Otto Wieland in 1928,[13] the 1938 prize awarded to Richard Kuhn in 1939,[14] the 1943 prize awarded to George de Hevesy in 1944,[15] and the 1944 prize awarded to Otto Hahn in 1945.[16]\n\n\nIn 2020, Ioannidis et al. reported that half of the Nobel Prizes for science awarded between 1995 and 2017 were clustered in just a few disciplines within their broader fields. Atomic physics, particle physics, cell biology, and neuroscience dominated the two subjects outside chemistry, while molecular chemistry was the chief prize-winning discipline in its domain. Molecular chemists won 5.3% of all science Nobel Prizes during this period.[17]\n\n\n\n\n## Laureates[edit]\n\n\n* 1901\n* 1910\n* 1920\n* 1930\n* 1940\n* 1950\n* 1960\n* 1970\n* 1980\n* 1990\n*

It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel, who died in 1896. These prizes are awarded for outstanding contributions in chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine.[1] As dictated by Nobel's will, the award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.[2] The first Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded in 1901 to Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff, of the Netherlands. Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a monetary award prize that has varied throughout the years.[3] In 1901, van 't Hoff received 150,782 SEK, which is equal to 7,731,004 SEK in December 2007. The award is presented in Stockholm at an annual ceremony on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death.[4]\n\n\nAt least 25 laureates have received the Nobel Prize for contributions in the field of organic chemistry, more than any other field of chemistry.[5] Two Nobel Prize laureates in Chemistry, Germans Richard Kuhn (1938) and Adolf Butenandt (1939), were not allowed by their government to accept the prize. They would later receive a medal and diploma, but not the money. Frederick Sanger is one out of three laureates to be awarded the Nobel Prize twice in the same subject, in 1958 and 1980. John Bardeen, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1956 and 1972, and Karl Barry Sharpless, who won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 2001 and 2022, are the others. Two others have won Nobel Prizes twice, one in chemistry and one in another subject: Maria Skłodowska-Curie (physics in 1903, chemistry in 1911) and Linus Pauling (chemistry in 1954, peace in 1962).[6] As of 2022, the prize has been awarded to 189 individuals, including eight women (Maria Skłodowska-Curie being the first to be awarded in 1911).[7]\n\n\nThere have been eight years for which the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was not awarded (1916, 1917, 1919, 1924, 1933, 1940–42). There were also nine years for which the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was delayed for one year. The Prize was not awarded in 1914, as the Nobel Committee for Chemistry decided that none of that year's nominations met the necessary criteria, but was awarded to Theodore William Richards in 1915 and counted as the 1914 prize.[8] This precedent was followed for the 1918 prize awarded to Fritz Haber in 1919,[9] the 1920 prize awarded to Walther Nernst in 1921,[10] the 1921 prize awarded to Frederick Soddy in 1922,[11] the 1925 prize awarded to Richard Zsigmondy in 1926,[12] the 1927 prize awarded to Heinrich Otto Wieland in 1928,[13] the 1938 prize awarded to Richard Kuhn in 1939,[14] the 1943 prize awarded to George de Hevesy in 1944,[15] and the 1944 prize awarded to Otto Hahn in 1945.[16]\n\n\nIn 2020, Ioannidis et al. reported that half of the Nobel Prizes for science awarded between 1995 and 2017 were clustered in just a few disciplines within their broader fields. Atomic physics, particle physics, cell biology, and neuroscience dominated the two subjects outside chemistry, while molecular chemistry was the chief prize-winning discipline in its domain. Molecular chemists won 5.3% of all science Nobel Prizes during this period.[17]\n\n\n\n\n## Laureates[edit]\n\n\n* 1901\n* 1910\n* 1920\n* 1930\n* 1940\n* 1950\n* 1960\n* 1970\n* 1980\n* 1990\n*

Albert Cotton |\n|  |\n\n\n**Ada E. Yonath** (Hebrew: עדה יונת, pronounced [ˈada joˈnat]; born 22 June 1939)[1] is an Israeli chemist and Nobel laureate crystallographer best known for her pioneering work on the structure of ribosomes. She is the current director of the Helen and Milton A. Kimmelman Center for Biomolecular Structure and Assembly of the Weizmann Institute of Science.\n\n\nIn 2009, Yonath received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry along with Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas A. Steitz for her studies on the structure and function of the ribosome, becoming the first Israeli woman to win the Nobel Prize out of ten Israeli Nobel laureates,[2] the first woman from the Middle East to win a Nobel prize in the sciences,[3] and the first woman in 45 years to win the Nobel Prize for Chemistry.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## Biography[edit]\n\n\nAda Lifshitz (later Yonath)[5] was born in the Geula quarter of Jerusalem.[6] Her parents, Hillel and Esther Lifshitz, were Zionist Jews who immigrated to the British Mandate of Palestine (now Israel) from Zduńska Wola, Poland in 1933 before the establishment of Israel.[7] Her father was a rabbi and came from a rabbinical family. They settled in Jerusalem and ran a grocery, but found it difficult to make ends meet. They lived in cramped quarters with several other families, and Yonath remembers \"books\" being the only thing she had to keep her occupied.[8] Despite their poverty, her parents sent her to school in the upscale Beit HaKerem neighborhood to assure her a good education. When her father died at the age of 42, the family moved to Tel Aviv.[9]\n\n\nYonath was accepted to Tichon Hadash high school although her mother could not pay the tuition. She gave math lessons to students in return.[10] As a youngster, she says she was inspired by the Polish and naturalized-French scientist Marie Curie.[11] However, she stresses that Curie, whom she as a child was fascinated by after reading her biography, was not her \"role model\".[12] She returned to Jerusalem for college, graduating from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem with a bachelor's degree in chemistry in 1962, and a master's degree in biochemistry in 1964. In 1968, she obtained her PhD from the Weizmann Institute of Science for X-ray crystallographic studies on the structure of collagen, with Wolfie Traub as her PhD advisor.[13][14][15]\n\n\nShe has one daughter, Hagit Yonath, a doctor at Sheba Medical Center, and a granddaughter, Noa.[16] She is the cousin of anti-occupation activist Ruchama Marton.[17]\n\n\n\n## Scientific career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ada Yonath at the Weizmann Institute of Science\nYonath accepted postdoctoral positions at Carnegie Mellon University (1969) and MIT (1970). While a postdoc at MIT she spent some time in the lab of subsequent 1976 chemistry Nobel Prize winner William N. Lipscomb, Jr. of Harvard University where she was inspired to pursue very large structures.[18]\n\n\nIn 1970, she established what was for nearly a decade the only protein crystallography laboratory in Israel. Then, from 1979 to 1984 she was a group leader with Heinz-Günter Wittmann at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics in Berlin. She was visiting professor at the University of Chicago in 1977–78.[19] She headed a Max-Planck Institute Research Unit at DESY in Hamburg, Germany (1986–2004) in parallel to her research activities at the Weizmann Institute.\n\n\nYonath focuses on the mechanisms underlying protein biosynthesis, by ribosomal crystallography, a research line she pioneered over twenty years ago despite considerable skepticism of the international scientific community.[20] Ribosomes translate RNA into protein and because they have slightly different structures in microbes, when compared to eukaryotes, such as human cells, they are often a target for antibiotics. In 2000 and 2001, she determined the complete high-resolution structures of both ribosomal subunits and discovered within the otherwise asymmetric ribosome, the universal symmetrical region that provides the framework and navigates the process of polypeptide polymerization. Consequently, she showed that the ribosome is a ribozyme that places its substrates in stereochemistry suitable for peptide bond formation and for substrate-mediated catalysis. In 1993 she visualized the path taken by the nascent proteins, namely the ribosomal tunnel, and recently revealed the dynamics elements enabling its involvement in elongation arrest, gating, intra-cellular regulation and nascent chain trafficking into their folding space.\n\n\nAdditionally, Yonath elucidated the modes of action of over twenty different antibiotics targeting the ribosome, illuminated mechanisms of drug resistance and synergism, deciphered the structural basis for antibiotic selectivity and showed how it plays a key role in clinical usefulness and therapeutic effectiveness, thus paving the way for structure-based drug design.\n\n\nFor enabling ribosomal crystallography Yonath introduced a novel technique, cryo bio-crystallography, which became routine in structural biology and allowed intricate projects otherwise considered formidable.[21]\n\n\nAt the Weizmann Institute, Yonath is the incumbent of the Martin S. and Helen Kimmel Professorial Chair.\n\n\n\n## Political Views[edit]\n\n\nShe has called for the unconditional release of all Hamas prisoners, saying that \"holding Palestinians captive encourages and perpetuates their motivation to harm Israel and its citizens ... once we don't have any prisoners to release they will have no reason to kidnap soldiers\".[22]\n\n\n\n## Awards and recognition[edit]\n\n\nTelephone interview with Ada Yonath during the announcement of the Nobel Prize\nYonath is a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences; the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities; the European Academy of Sciences and Art and the European Molecular Biology Organization.

In 2018, she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for pioneering the use of directed evolution to engineer enzymes.[2]\n\n\nSince January 2021, she serves as an external co-chair of President Joe Biden's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST).[3][4]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nArnold is the daughter of Josephine Inman (née Routheau) and nuclear physicist William Howard Arnold, and the granddaughter of Lieutenant General William Howard Arnold.[5] She has an older brother, Bill and younger brothers, Edward, David and Thomas. She grew up in the Pittsburgh suburb of Edgewood, and the Pittsburgh neighborhoods of Shadyside and Squirrel Hill, graduating from the city's Taylor Allderdice High School in 1974.[6] As a high schooler, she hitchhiked to Washington, D.C., to protest the Vietnam War and lived on her own, working as a cocktail waitress at a local jazz club and a cab driver.[7]\n\n\nThe same independence that drove Arnold to move out of her childhood home as a teenager also led to a large volume of absences from school and low grades. In spite of this, she made near perfect scores on standardized tests and was determined to attend Princeton University, the alma mater of her father. She applied as a mechanical engineering major and was accepted.[8] Arnold's motivation behind studying engineering, as stated in her Nobel Prize interview, was that \"[mechanical engineering] was the easiest option and the easiest way to get into Princeton University at the time and I never left\".[9]\n\n\nArnold graduated in 1979 with a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in mechanical and aerospace engineering from Princeton University, where she focused on solar energy research.[10] In addition to the courses required for her major, she took classes in economics, Russian, and Italian, and envisioned herself as becoming a diplomat or CEO, even considering getting an advanced degree in international affairs.[11] She took a year off from Princeton after her second year to travel to Italy and work in a factory that made nuclear reactor parts, then returned to complete her studies.[12] Back at Princeton, she began studying at its Center for Energy and Environmental Studies – a group of scientists and engineers, at the time led by Robert Socolow, working to develop sustainable energy sources, a topic that would become a focus of her later work.[12]\n\n\nAfter graduating from Princeton in 1979, Arnold worked as an engineer in South Korea and Brazil and at Colorado's Solar Energy Research Institute.[12] At the Solar Energy Research Institute (now the National Renewable Energy Laboratory), she worked on designing solar energy facilities for remote locations and helped write United Nations (UN) position papers.[11]\n\n\nShe then enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, where she earned a PhD degree in chemical engineering in 1985[13] and became deeply interested in biochemistry.[14][12] Her thesis work, carried out in the lab of Harvey Warren Blanch, investigated affinity chromatography techniques.[13][15] Arnold had no chemistry background before pursuing a doctorate in chemical engineering. For the first year of her Ph.D. coursework, the graduate committee at UC Berkeley required that she take undergraduate chemistry courses.[8]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nAfter earning her Ph.D., Arnold completed postdoctoral research in biophysical chemistry at Berkeley.[16] In 1986, she joined the California Institute of Technology as a visiting associate. She was promoted to assistant professor in 1986, associate professor in 1992, and full professor in 1996. She was named the Dick and Barbara Dickinson Professor of Chemical Engineering, Bioengineering and Biochemistry in 2000 and, her current position, the Linus Pauling Professor of Chemical Engineering, Bioengineering and Biochemistry in 2017.[17] In 2013, she was appointed director of Caltech's Donna and Benjamin M. Rosen Bioengineering Center.[17]\n\n\nArnold served on the Science Board for the Santa Fe Institute from 1995 to 2000.[18] She was a member of the Advisory Board of the Joint BioEnergy Institute. Arnold chairs the Advisory Panel of the Packard Fellowships in Science and Engineering. She served on the President's Advisory Council of the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST). She served as a judge for The Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering and worked with the National Academy of Science's Science & Entertainment Exchange to help Hollywood screenwriters accurately portray science topics.[19]\n\n\nIn 2000 Arnold was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering for integration of fundamentals in molecular biology, genetics, and bioengineering to the benefit of life science and industry.\n\n\nShe is co-inventor on over 40 US patents.[14] She co-founded Gevo, Inc., a company to make fuels and chemicals from renewable resources in 2005.[14] In 2013, she and two of her former students, Peter Meinhold and Pedro Coelho, cofounded a company called Provivi to research alternatives to pesticides for crop protection.[14][20][21] She has been on the corporate board of the genomics company Illumina Inc. since 2016.[22][23]\n\n\nIn 2019 she was named to the board of Alphabet Inc., making Arnold the third female director of the Google parent company.[24]\n\n\nIn January 2021 she was named an external co-chair of President Joe Biden's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST). She is working with Biden's transition team to help identify scientists for roles in the administration. She says her main job now is to help choose PCAST's additional members and to get to work setting a scientific agenda for the group. She has stated: \"We have to reestablish the importance of science in policymaking, in decision making across the government. We need to reestablish the trust of the American people in science ... I think that PCAST can play a beneficial role in that.\"[25]\n\n\n\n### Research[edit]\n\n\nArnold is credited with pioneering the use of directed evolution to create enzymes (biochemical molecules—often proteins—that catalyze, or speed up, chemical reactions) with improved and/or novel functions.[26] The directed evolution strategy involves iterative rounds of mutagenesis and screening for proteins with improved functions and it has been used to create useful biological systems, including enzymes, metabolic pathways, genetic regulatory circuits, and organisms. In nature, evolution by natural selection can lead to proteins (including enzymes) well-suited to carry out biological tasks, but natural selection can only act on existing sequence variations (mutations) and typically occurs over long time periods.[27] Arnold speeds up the process by introducing mutations in the underlying sequences of proteins; she then tests these mutations' effects. If a mutation improves the proteins' function she can keep iterating the process to optimize it further. This strategy has broad implications because it can be used to design proteins for a wide variety of applications.[28] For example, she has used directed evolution to design enzymes that can be used to produce renewable fuels and pharmaceutical compounds with less harm to the environment.[26]\n\n\nOne advantage of directed evolution is that the mutations do not have to be completely random; instead, they can be random enough to discover unexplored potential, but not so random as to be inefficient. The number of possible mutation combinations is astronomical, but instead of just randomly trying to test as many as possible, she integrates her knowledge of biochemistry to narrow down the options, focusing on introducing mutations in areas of the protein that are likely to have the most positive effect on activity and avoiding areas in which mutations would likely be, at best, neutral and at worst, detrimental (such as disrupting proper protein folding).[26]\n\n\nArnold applied directed evolution to the optimization of enzymes (although not the first person to do so, see e.g. Barry Hall[29]). In[26] her seminal work, published in 1993, she used the method to engineer a version of subtilisin E that was active in the organic solvent DMF, a highly unnatural environment.[30] She carried out the work using four sequential rounds of mutagenesis of the enzyme's gene, expressed by bacteria, through error-prone PCR. After each round she screened the enzymes for their ability to hydrolyze the milk protein casein in the presence of DMF by growing the bacteria on agar plates containing casein and DMF. The bacteria secreted the enzyme and, if it were functional, it would hydrolyze the casein and produce a visible halo. She selected the bacteria that had the biggest halos and isolated their DNA for further rounds of mutagenesis.[26] Using this method, she designed an enzyme that had 256 times more activity in DMF than the original.[31]\n\n\nShe has further developed her methods and applied them under different selection criteria in order to optimize enzymes for different functions. She showed that, whereas naturally evolved enzymes tend to function well at a narrow temperature range, enzymes could be produced using directed evolution that could function at both high and low temperatures.[26] In addition to improving the existing functions of natural enzymes, Arnold has designed enzymes that perform functions for which no previous specific enzyme existed, such as when she evolved cytochrome P450 to carry out cyclopropanation[32] and carbene and nitrene transfer reactions.[26][33]\n\n\nIn addition to evolving individual molecules, she has used directed evolution to co-evolve enzymes in biosynthetic pathways, such as those involved in the production of carotenoids[34] and L-methionine[35] in *Escherichia coli* (which has the potential to be used as a whole-cell biocatalyst).[26] She has applied these methods to biofuel production. For example, she evolved bacteria to produce the biofuel isobutanol; it can be produced in *E. coli* bacteria, but the production pathway requires the cofactor NADPH, whereas E. coli makes the cofactor NADH. To circumvent this problem, she evolved the enzymes in the pathway to use NADH instead of NADPH, allowing for the production of isobutanol.[26][36]\n\n\nArnold has also used directed evolution to design highly specific and efficient enzymes that can be used as environmentally-friendly alternatives to some industrial chemical synthesis procedures.[26] She, and others using her methods, have engineered enzymes that can carry out synthesis reactions more quickly, with fewer by-products, and in some cases eliminating the need for hazardous heavy metals.[31]\n\n\nShe uses structure-guided protein recombination to combine parts of different proteins to form protein chimeras with unique functions. She developed computational methods, such as SCHEMA, to predict how the parts can be combined without disrupting their parental structure, so that the chimeras will fold properly, and then applies directed evolution to further mutate the chimeras to optimize their functions.[37][38]\n\n\nAt Caltech, Arnold runs a laboratory that continues to study directed evolution and its applications in environmentally-friendly chemical synthesis and green/alternative energy, including the development of highly active enzymes (cellulolytic and biosynthetic enzymes) and microorganisms to convert renewable biomass to fuels and chemicals. A paper published in Science in 2019, with Inha Cho and Zhi-Jun Jia, has been retracted on January 2, 2020, as the results were found to be not reproducible.[39]\n\n\nAs of 2021[update], Arnold has an h-index of 135 according to Google Scholar.[40]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nArnold lives in La Cañada Flintridge, California. She was married to James E. Bailey from 1987 to 1991, who died of cancer in 2001.[41][22] The couple had James Howard Bailey (born in 1990). Her stepson Sean Bailey is an American film and television producer. He has been the president of Walt Disney Studios Motion Picture Production since his appointment in 2010. .[42] Arnold was herself diagnosed with breast cancer in 2005 and underwent treatment for 18 months.[43]\n\n\nArnold was in a common-law marriage with Caltech astrophysicist Andrew E. Lange,[44] beginning in 1994, and they had two sons, William Andrew Lange (1995) and Joseph Inman Lange (1997).[45][42] Lange committed suicide in 2010 and one of their sons, William Lange-Arnold, died in an accident in 2016.[22] Her father, William Howard Arnold died in 2015. [46]\n\n\nHer hobbies include traveling, scuba diving, skiing, dirt-bike riding, and hiking.[43]\n\n\n\n## Honors and awards[edit]\n\n\nArnold's work has been recognized by many awards, including the 2018 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, the 2011 National Academy of Engineering (NAE) Draper Prize (the first woman to receive it), and a 2011 National Medal of Technology and Innovation.[17] She was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2011 and inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2014.[17] She was the first woman to be elected to all three National Academies in the United States – the National Academy of Engineering (2000), the National Academy of Medicine, formerly called the Institute of Medicine (2004), and the National Academy of Sciences (2008).[17]\n\n\nArnold is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Academy of Microbiology, the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering and an International Fellow of the UK's Royal Academy of Engineering in 2018.[47][48]\n\n\nIn 2016 she became the first woman to win the Millennium Technology Prize, which she won for pioneering directed evolution.[49] In 2017, Arnold was awarded the Raymond and Beverly Sackler Prize in Convergence Research by the National Academy of Sciences, which recognizes extraordinary contributions to convergence research.[50]\n\n\nIn 2018 she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her work in directed evolution, making her the fifth woman to receive the award in its 117 years of existence, and the first American woman.[51][52] She received a one-half share of the award, with the other half jointly awarded to George Smith and Gregory Winter \"for the phage display of peptides and antibodies.\"[26] She is the first female graduate of Princeton to be awarded a Nobel Prize and the first person who got their undergraduate degree from Princeton (male or female) to receive a Nobel Prize in one of the natural sciences categories (chemistry, physics, and physiology or medicine).[10] In November 2018, she was listed as one of BBC's 100 Women.[53] On October 24, 2019, Pope Francis named her a member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences.[54] In 2022 she was the guest in an episode of *The Life Scientific* on BBC Radio 4.[55]\n\n\n\n* Perkin Medal (2023)[56]\n* Foreign Member of the Royal Society (2020)[57]\n* Honorary doctorate, Technical University of Denmark (2019)[58]\n* Nobel Prize in Chemistry (2018)\n* Elected to the American Philosophical Society (2018)[59]\n* Elected an International Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering (2018)[60]\n* Raymond and Beverly Sackler Prize in Convergence Research (2017)\n* Spiegelman Lecture, University of Illinois (2017)[61]\n* Society of Women Engineers' 2017 Achievement Award[62]\n* Honorary Degree of Doctor of Science from Dartmouth College (2017)[63]\n* Honorary doctorate, University of Chicago (2016)[64]\n* Millennium Technology Prize (2016)[65]\n* Honorary degree of Doctor of Science from the ETH Zurich (2015)[66]\n* Elmer Gaden Award, Biotechnology and Bioengineering (2015)[64]\n* Inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame (2014)[67]\n* Golden Plate Award, American Academy of Achievement (2014)[64][68]\n* Emanuel Merck Lectureship (2013)[69]\n* ENI Prize in Renewable and Nonconventional Energy (2013)[70]\n* Honorary Degree of Doctor of Science from the Stockholm University (2013)[71]\n* Charles Stark Draper Prize (2011)[72]\n* National Medal of Technology and Innovation[73] (2011)\n* American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2011)[64]\n* Honorary Degree of Doctor of Science from Stockholm University (2013)[74]\n* Elected fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (2010)[64]\n* Elected fellow of the American Academy of Microbiology (2009)[64]\n* Elected to the National Academy of Sciences (2008)[64]\n* FASEB Excellence in Science Award (2007)[64]\n* Enzyme Engineering Award from Engineering Conferences International and Genencor (2007)[75]\n* Francis P.

In 2018, she founded an independent research institute, the Max Planck Unit for the Science of Pathogens.[3] In 2020, Charpentier and American biochemist Jennifer Doudna of the University of California, Berkeley, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry \"for the development of a method for genome editing\" (through CRISPR). This was the first science Nobel Prize ever won by two women only.[4][5][6]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nBorn in 1968 in Juvisy-sur-Orge in France, Charpentier studied biochemistry, microbiology, and genetics at the Pierre and Marie Curie University (which became the Faculty of Science of Sorbonne University) in Paris.[7] She was a graduate student at the Institut Pasteur from 1992 to 1995 and was awarded a research doctorate. Charpentier's PhD work investigated molecular mechanisms involved in antibiotic resistance.[8] Her paternal grandfather was an Armenian who escaped to France during the Armenian genocide and met his wife in Marseille.[9]\n\n\n\n## Career and research[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology in Berlin, Germany\nCharpentier worked as a university teaching assistant at Pierre and Marie Curie University from 1993 to 1995 and as a postdoctoral fellow at the Institut Pasteur from 1995 to 1996. She moved to the US and worked as a postdoctoral fellow at Rockefeller University in New York from 1996 to 1997. During this time, Charpentier worked in the lab of microbiologist Elaine Tuomanen.[10] Tuomanen's lab investigated how the pathogen *Streptococcus pneumoniae* utilizes mobile genetic elements to alter its genome. Charpentier also helped to demonstrate how *S. pneumoniae* develops vancomycin resistance.[11]\n\n\nCharpentier worked as an assistant research scientist at the New York University Medical Center from 1997 to 1999. There she worked in the lab of Pamela Cowin, a skin-cell biologist interested in mammalian gene manipulation. Charpentier published a paper exploring the regulation of hair growth in mice.[12] She held the position of Research Associate at the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and at the Skirball Institute of Biomolecular Medicine[13] in New York from 1999 to 2002.[7]\n\n\nAfter five years in the United States, Charpentier returned to Europe and became the lab head and a guest professor at the Institute of Microbiology and Genetics, University of Vienna, from 2002 to 2004. In 2004, Charpentier published her discovery of an RNA molecule involved in the regulation of virulence-factor synthesis in *Streptococcus pyogenes*.[14] From 2004 to 2006 she was lab head and an assistant professor at the Department of Microbiology and Immunobiology. In 2006 she became a privatdozentin (Microbiology) and received her habilitation at the Centre of Molecular Biology. From 2006 to 2009 she worked as lab head and associate professor at the Max F. Perutz Laboratories.[7]\n\n\nCharpentier moved to Sweden and became lab head and associate professor at the Laboratory for Molecular Infection Medicine Sweden (MIMS), at Umeå University. She held the position of group leader from 2008 to 2013 and was visiting professor from 2014 to 2017.[15] She moved to Germany to act as department head and W3 Professor at the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research[16] in Braunschweig and the Hannover Medical School from 2013 until 2015. In 2014 she became an Alexander von Humboldt Professor.[7]\n\n\nIn 2015 Charpentier accepted an offer from the German Max Planck Society to become a scientific member of the society and a director at the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology in Berlin. Since 2016, she has been an Honorary Professor at Humboldt University in Berlin; since 2018, she is the Founding and acting director of the Max Planck Unit for the Science of Pathogens.[7][17][18] Charpentier retained her position as visiting professor at Umeå University until the end of 2017 when a new donation from the Kempe Foundations and the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation allowed her to offer more young researchers positions within research groups of the MIMS Laboratory.[19]\n\n\n\n## CRISPR/Cas9[edit]\n\n\nCharpentier is best known for her Nobel-winning work of deciphering the molecular mechanisms of a bacterial immune system, called CRISPR/Cas9, and repurposing it into a tool for genome editing. In particular, she uncovered a novel mechanism for the maturation of a non-coding RNA which is pivotal in the function of CRISPR/Cas9. Specifically, Charpentier demonstrated that a small RNA called tracrRNA is essential for the maturation of crRNA.[20]\n\n\nIn 2011, Charpentier met Jennifer Doudna at a research conference in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and they began a collaboration.[10] Working with Doudna's laboratory, Charpentier's laboratory showed that Cas9 could be used to make cuts in any DNA sequence desired.[21][22] The method they developed involved the combination of Cas9 with easily created synthetic \"guide RNA\" molecules. Synthetic guide RNA is a chimera of crRNA and tracrRNA; therefore, this discovery demonstrated that the CRISPR-Cas9 technology could be used to edit the genome with relative ease.[22] Researchers worldwide have employed this method successfully to edit the DNA sequences of plants, animals, and laboratory cell lines. Since its discovery, CRISPR has revolutionized genetics by allowing scientists to edit genes to probe their role in health and disease and to develop genetic therapies with the hope that it will prove safer and more effective than the first generation of gene therapies.[6]\n\n\nIn 2013, Charpentier co-founded CRISPR Therapeutics and ERS Genomics along with Shaun Foy and Rodger Novak.[23]\n\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\n![Emmanuelle Charpentier in the Senate Chamber of York University in 2016, after giving her Gairdner Foundation International Award Lecture](image)Emmanuelle Charpentier in the Senate Chamber of York University in 2016, after giving her Gairdner Foundation International Award Lecture\nIn 2015, *Time* magazine designated Charpentier one of the *Time* 100 most influential people in the world (together with Jennifer Doudna).[24][25] Charpentier Awards are as follows:\n\n\nNobel Prize in Chemistry,[26] the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences, the Louis-Jeantet Prize for Medicine, the Gruber Foundation International Prize in Genetics, the Leibniz Prize, the Tang Prize, the Japan Prize, and the Kavli Prize in Nanoscience.

Doudna was one of the first women to share a Nobel in the sciences. She received the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, with Emmanuelle Charpentier, \"for the development of a method for genome editing.\"[3][4] She is the Li Ka Shing Chancellor's Chair Professor in the department of chemistry and the department of molecular and cell biology at the University of California, Berkeley. She has been an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute since 1997.[5]\n\n\n\nDoudna graduated from Pomona College in 1985 and earned a Ph.D. from Harvard Medical School in 1989. Apart from her professorship at Berkeley, she is also president and chair of the board of the Innovative Genomics Institute, a faculty scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, a senior investigator at the Gladstone Institutes, and an adjunct professor of cellular and molecular pharmacology at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF).[6][7][8][9] In 2012, Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier were the first to propose that CRISPR-Cas9 (enzymes from bacteria that control microbial immunity) could be used for programmable editing of genomes,[10][11] which has been called one of the most significant discoveries in the history of biology.[12] Since then, Doudna has been a leading figure in what is referred to as the \"CRISPR revolution\" for her fundamental work and leadership in developing CRISPR-mediated genome editing.[10] \n\n![](image)Dr Jennifer Doudna at the Innovative Genomics Institute\nHer many other awards and fellowships include the 2000 Alan T. Waterman Award for her research on the structure of a ribozyme, as determined by X-ray crystallography[13] and the 2015 Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences for CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technology, with Charpentier.[14] She has been a co-recipient of the Gruber Prize in Genetics (2015),[15] the Tang Prize (2016),[16] the Canada Gairdner International Award (2016),[17] and the Japan Prize (2017).[18] She was named one of the *Time* 100 most influential people in 2015.[19]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nJennifer Doudna was born February 19, 1964, in Washington, D.C., as the daughter of Dorothy Jane (Williams) and Martin Kirk Doudna.[2][20] Her father received his Ph.D. in English literature from the University of Michigan, and her mother, a stay-at-home parent, held a master's degree in education.[10][11] When Doudna was seven years old, the family moved to Hawaii so her father could accept a teaching position in American literature at the University of Hawaii at Hilo.[10][11] Doudna's mother earned a second master's degree in Asian history from the university and taught history at a local community college.[10][11]\n\n\nGrowing up in Hilo, Hawaii, Doudna was fascinated by the environmental beauty of the island and its flora and fauna. Nature built her sense of curiosity and her desire to understand the underlying biological mechanisms of life.[10][11] This was coupled with the atmosphere of intellectual pursuit that her parents encouraged at home. Her father enjoyed reading about science and filled the home with many books on popular science.[10][11] When Doudna was in the sixth grade, he gave her a copy of James Watson's 1968 book on the discovery of the structure of DNA, *The Double Helix,* which was a major inspiration.[21] Doudna also developed her interest in science and mathematics in school.[10][21] Even though Doudna was told that \"Women don't go into science,\" she knew that she wanted to be a scientist no matter what. Nothing said to her made her doubt it, Doudna said, \"When someone tells me I can't do something and I know that I can, it just makes me more resolved to do it.\"[22]\n\n\nWhile she attended Hilo High School, Doudna's interest in science was nurtured by her 10th-grade chemistry teacher, Ms. Jeanette Wong, whom she has routinely cited as a significant influence in sparking her nascent scientific curiosity.[21][23][24][25] A visiting lecturer on cancer cells further encouraged her pursuit of science as a career choice.[21] She spent a summer working in the University of Hawaii at Hilo lab of noted mycologist Don Hemmes and graduated from Hilo High School in 1981.[26]\n\n\nDoudna was an undergraduate student at Pomona College in Claremont, California, where she studied biochemistry.[10][11] During her freshman year, while taking a course in general chemistry, she questioned her own ability to pursue a career in science, and considered switching her major to French as a sophomore.[7][10] However, her French teacher suggested she stick with science.[10][7] Chemistry professors Fred Grieman and Corwin Hansch at Pomona had a major impact on her.[7] She started her first scientific research in the lab of professor Sharon Panasenko.[7] She earned her Bachelor of Arts degree in biochemistry in 1985.[7][27] She chose Harvard Medical School for her doctoral study and earned a PhD in Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology in 1989.[5][28] Her Ph.D. dissertation was on a system that increased the efficiency of a self-replicating catalytic RNA[14] and was supervised by Jack W. Szostak.[14]\n\n\n\n## Career and research[edit]\n\n\nAfter her PhD, she held research fellowships in molecular biology at the Massachusetts General Hospital and in genetics at Harvard Medical School.[5] From 1991 to 1994, she was Lucille P. Markey Postdoctoral Scholar in Biomedical Science at the University of Colorado Boulder, where she worked with Thomas Cech.[5] As of 2022[update], Doudna has an h-index of 141 according to Google Scholar[9] and of 111 according to Scopus.[29]\n\n\n\n### Research on ribozyme structure and function[edit]\n\n\nEarly in her scientific career, Doudna worked to uncover the structure and biological function of RNA enzymes or ribozymes.[7] While in the Szostak lab, Doudna re-engineered the self-splicing *Tetrahymena* Group I catalytic intron into a true catalytic ribozyme that copied RNA templates.[7] Her focus was on engineering ribozymes and understanding their underlying mechanisms; however, she came to realize that not being able to see the molecular mechanisms of ribozymes was a major problem. Doudna went to the lab of Thomas Cech at the University of Colorado Boulder to crystallize and determine the three-dimensional structure of a ribozyme for the first time, so ribozyme structure could be compared with that of Enzymes, the catalytic Proteins.[7] She started this project at the Cech lab in 1991 and finished it at Yale University in 1996.[14] Doudna joined Yale's Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry as an assistant professor in 1994.[5] \n\n![](image)Portrait of Dr Jennifer Doudna by Christopher Michel for the National Academies\n### X-ray diffraction-based structure of active site of a ribozyme at Yale[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Shape of a self-splicing intron with two exons (shown in red and blue). DS Goodsell, 2005, PDB\nAt Yale, Doudna's group was able to crystallize and solve the three-dimensional structure of the catalytic core of the *Tetrahymena* Group I ribozyme.[7] They showed that a core of five magnesium ions clustered in one region of the P4-P6 domain of the ribozyme, forming a hydrophobic core around which the rest of the structure could fold.[7] This is analogous, but chemically distinct from, the way proteins typically have a core of hydrophobic amino acids.[7] Her group has crystallized other ribozymes,[14] including the Hepatitis Delta Virus ribozyme.[7] This initial work to solve large RNA structures led to further structural studies on an internal ribosome entry site(IRES) and protein-RNA complexes such as the Signal Recognition Particle.[7]\n\n\nDoudna was promoted to the position of Henry Ford II Professor of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry at Yale in 2000. In 2000–2001, she was Robert Burns Woodward Visiting Professor of Chemistry at Harvard University.[5]\n\n\n\n### Move to Berkeley[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| External videos |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| ![video icon](image) \"CRISPR Biology and Biotechnology: The Future of Genome Editing\", Jennifer Doudna delivers the 29th annual Ullyot Public Affairs Lecture, Science History Institute |\n\n\nIn 2002, she joined her husband, Jamie Cate, at Berkeley, accepting a position as professor of biochemistry and molecular biology.[14] Doudna also gained access to the synchrotron at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory for her experiments with high powered x-ray diffraction.[14]\n\n\nIn 2009, she took a leave of absence from Berkeley to work at Genentech to lead discovery research.[30] She left Genentech after two months and returned to Berkeley with the help of colleague Michael Marletta,[31] cancelling all of her obligations to study CRISPR.[30]\n\n\nAs of 2020, Doudna was located at the University of California, Berkeley, where she directs the Innovative Genomics Institute, a collaboration between Berkeley and UCSF; holds the Li Ka Shing Chancellor's Professorship in Biomedicine and Health; and is the chair of the Chancellor's Advisor Committee on Biology.[5] Her lab now focuses on obtaining a mechanistic understanding of biological processes involving RNA.[14] This work is divided into three major areas: the CRISPR system, RNA interference, and translational control via MicroRNAs.[14]\n\n\n\n### CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing discovery[edit]\n\n\nDoudna was introduced to CRISPR by Jillian Banfield in 2006 who had found Doudna by way of a Google search, having typed \"RNAi and UC Berkeley\" into her browser, and Doudna's name came up at the top of the list.[32][33] In 2012, Doudna and her colleagues made a new discovery that reduces the time and work needed to edit genomic DNA.[34][35] Their discovery relies on a protein named Cas9 found in the *Streptococcus* bacterial \"CRISPR\" immune system that cooperates with guide RNA and works like scissors. The protein attacks its prey, the DNA of viruses, and slices it up, preventing it from infecting the bacterium.[11] This system was first discovered by Yoshizumi Ishino and colleagues in 1987[36] and later characterized by Francisco Mojica,[37] but Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier showed for the first time that they could use different RNAs to program it to cut and edit different DNAs.[11]\n\n\nAs CRISPR becomes increasingly used to edit multicellular organisms, Doudna continues to be called upon to serve as a thought-leader on the ethics of changing an organism's function using CRISPR technology.[38] Their discovery has since been further developed by many research groups[14] for applications ranging from fundamental cell biology, plant, and animal research to treatments for diseases including sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, Huntington's disease, and HIV.[10][34] Doudna and several other leading biologists called for a worldwide moratorium on any clinical application of gene editing using CRISPR.[39][40] Doudna supports the usage of CRISPR in somatic gene editing, gene alterations which do not get passed to the next generation, but not germline gene editing.[41]\n\n\n\n![](image)CRISPR-Cas9 complex\nThe CRISPR system created a new straightforward way to edit DNA and there was a rush to patent the technique.[10] Doudna and UC Berkeley collaborators applied for a patent and so did a group at the Broad Institute affiliated with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard.[42] Feng Zhang at the Broad Institute had shown that CRISPR-Cas9 could edit genes in cultured human cells a few months after Doudna and Charpentier published their method.[34] Before the UC Berkeley patent application was decided, a patent was granted to the Broad investigators and UC Berkeley filed a lawsuit against the decision.[42] In 2017, the court decided in favor of the Broad Institute, who claimed that they had initiated the research earliest and had first applied it to human cell engineering thus supporting editing in human cells with evidence but that the UC Berkeley group had only suggested this application.[42] UC Berkeley appealed on grounds that they had clearly discussed and spelled out how to do the application the Broad had pursued.[43] In September 2018, the appeals court decided in favor of the Broad Institute's patent.[44] Meanwhile, UC Berkeley and co-applicants' patent to cover the general technique was also granted.[45] To further cloud the issue, in Europe the claim of the Broad Institute, to have initiated the research first, was disallowed.[46] The rejection was due to a procedural flaw in the application involving a different set of personnel listed in the lawsuit and the patent application, leading to speculation that the UC Berkeley group would prevail in Europe.[46] Doudna cofounded Caribou Biosciences, a company to commercialize CRISPR technology, in 2011.[47] In September 2013, Doudna cofounded Editas Medicine with Zhang and others despite their legal battles, but she quit in June 2014; Charpentier then invited her to join CRISPR Therapeutics, but she declined following the \"divorce\"-like experience at Editas.[48] Doudna is also a cofounder of Caribou spin-off Intellia Therapeutics[49][50] and Scribe Therapeutics, which pioneered CasX, a more compact, next-generation Cas9 which can efficiently cut DNA.[51]\n\n\nIn 2017, she co-authored *A Crack in Creation: Gene Editing and the Unthinkable Power to Control Evolution*,[10] a rare case of the first-person account of a major scientific breakthrough, aimed at the general public.[52]\n\n\nIn addition to the CRISPR breakthrough, Doudna has discovered that the hepatitis C virus utilizes an unusual strategy to synthesize viral proteins.[53] This work could lead to new drugs to stop infections without causing harm to the tissues of the body.[53]\n\n\n\"I have so much optimism about what CRISPR can do to help cure unaddressed genetic diseases and improve sustainable agriculture, but I'm also concerned that the benefits of the technology might not reach those who need it most if we're not thoughtful and deliberate about how we develop the technology,\" Doudna said.[22]\n\n\n\n### Mammoth Biosciences[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, Doudna co-founded Mammoth Biosciences,[54] a San Francisco-based bioengineering tech startup. Initial funding raised $23 million,[55] with a series B round of funding in 2020 raising $45 million.[56] The business is focused on improving access to bio sensing tests which address \"challenges across healthcare, agriculture, environmental monitoring, biodefense, and more.\"[54]\n\n\n\n### COVID-19 response[edit]\n\n\nBeginning in March 2020, Doudna organized an effort to use CRISPR-based technologies to address the COVID-19 pandemic along with Dave Savage, Robert Tjian, and other colleagues at the Innovative Genomics Institute (IGI), where they created a testing center.[57] This center processes more than 1,000 patient samples per day.[58] Mammoth Biosciences announced a peer-reviewed validation of a rapid, CRISPR-based point of need COVID-19 diagnostic which is faster and less expensive than qRT-PCR based tests.[59]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nDoudna's first marriage was in 1988 to a fellow graduate student at Harvard named Tom Griffin, but his interests were more broad and less focused on research than hers and they divorced a few years later. Griffin wanted to move to Boulder, Colorado, where Doudna was also interested in working with Thomas Cech.[60] As a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Colorado, Doudna met Jamie Cate, then a graduate student. They worked together on the project to crystallize and determine the structure of the Tetrahymena Group I intron P4-P6 catalytic region. Doudna brought Cate with her to Yale, and they married in Hawaii in 2000. Cate later became a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Doudna followed him to Boston at Harvard, but in 2002 they both accepted faculty positions at Berkeley and moved there together; Cate preferred the less formal environment on the West Coast from his earlier experiences at the University of California, Santa Cruz and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and Doudna liked that Berkeley is a public university.[61] Cate is a Berkeley professor and works on gene-editing yeast to increase their cellulose fermentation for biofuel production. Doudna and Cate have a son born in 2002 who attends UC Berkeley, studying electrical engineering and computer science.[11]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of awards and honors received by Jennifer Doudna\n\nDoudna was a Searle Scholar and received the 1996 Beckman Young Investigators Award.[62][63][64] In 2000, she was awarded the Alan T.

Bertozzi Wins 2022 AAAS Lifetime Mentor Award\", AAAS, 10 February 2022 |\n\n\n**Carolyn Ruth Bertozzi** (born October 10, 1966) is an American chemist and Nobel laureate, known for her wide-ranging work spanning both chemistry and biology. She coined the term \"bioorthogonal chemistry\"[2] for chemical reactions compatible with living systems. Her recent efforts include synthesis of chemical tools to study cell surface sugars called glycans and how they affect diseases such as cancer, inflammation, and viral infections like COVID-19.[3] At Stanford University, she holds the Anne T. and Robert M. Bass Professorship in the School of Humanities and Sciences.[4] Bertozzi is also an Investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)[5] and is the former director of the Molecular Foundry, a nanoscience research center at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.[6]\n\n\nShe received the MacArthur \"genius\" award at age 33.[7] In 2010, she was the first woman to receive the prestigious Lemelson–MIT Prize faculty award. She is a member of the National Academy of Sciences (2005), the Institute of Medicine (2011), and the National Academy of Inventors (2013). In 2014, it was announced that Bertozzi would lead *ACS Central Science*, the American Chemical Society's first peer-reviewed open access journal, which offers all content free to the public.[8] Since 2021 she has been a member of the Accademia dei Lincei.[9]\nAs an open lesbian in academia and science, Bertozzi has been a role model for students and colleagues.[10][11]\n\n\nBertozzi was awarded the 2022 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, jointly with Morten P. Meldal and Karl Barry Sharpless, \"for the development of click chemistry and bioorthogonal chemistry\".[12]\n\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nCarolyn Bertozzi received her B.A. *summa cum laude* in chemistry from Harvard University, where she worked with Professor Joe Grabowski on the design and construction of a photoacoustic calorimeter.[13] Grabowski was impressed with her work and required Bertozzi to write a thesis on this project, which was submitted and Bertozzi won the Thomas T. Hoopes Undergraduate Thesis Prize with a large prize money.[14] While an undergraduate, she played in several bands, notably Bored of Education with future Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello.[15][16] After graduating from Harvard in 1988, she worked at Bell Labs with Chris Chidsey.[17]\n\n\nBertozzi completed her Ph.D. in chemistry at University of California, Berkeley in 1993 with Mark Bednarski, working on the chemical synthesis of oligosaccharide analogs.[18][19] While at Berkeley, she discovered that viruses can bind to sugars in the body.[20] The discovery led to her field of research, glycobiology. During Bertozzi's third year of graduate school, Bednarski was diagnosed with colon cancer, which resulted in him taking a leave of absence and changing his career path by enrolling in medical school. This left Bertozzi and the rest of the lab to complete their Ph.D. work with no direct supervision.[21][22]\n\n\n\n## Career and research[edit]\n\n\nAfter graduating from Berkeley with a Ph.D., Bertozzi was a postdoctoral fellow at University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) with Steven Rosen, where she studied the activity of endothelial oligosaccharides in promoting cell adhesion at inflammation sites.[23][24] While working with Rosen at UCSF, Bertozzi was able to modify the protein and sugar molecules in the walls of living cells so that the cells accept foreign materials such as implants.[25]\n\n\nIn 1996 Bertozzi became a faculty member in the UC Berkeley College of Chemistry[26] and a faculty scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, where she served as the director of the Molecular Foundry.[23][27] She has been an investigator with HHMI since 2000.[6] In 1999, while working with HHMI and at Berkeley, she founded the field of bioorthogonal chemistry and coined the term in 2003.[28][29][30] This new field and technique allows researchers to chemically modify molecules in living organisms and not interrupt the processes of the cell.[31] In 2015, Bertozzi moved to Stanford University to join the ChEM-H Institute.[32]\n\n\nBertozzi studies the glycobiology of underlying diseases such as cancer, inflammatory disorders such as arthritis, and infectious diseases such as tuberculosis. In particular, Bertozzi has advanced the understanding of cell surface oligosaccharides involved in cell recognition and inter-cellular communication. Bertozzi has applied the techniques of bioorthogonal chemistry to study glycocalyx, the sugars that surround the cell membrane. Her discoveries have advanced the field of biotherapeutics.[33] Her lab has also developed tools for research. One such development is creating chemical tools for studying glycans in living systems.[6] Her lab's development of nanotechnologies which probe biological systems lead to the development of a fast point-of-care tuberculosis test in 2018.[34][35] In 2017, due to her lab's discovery of linking the sugars on the surface of cancer cells and their ability to avoid the immune system defenses, she was invited to speak at Stanford's TED talk, giving a talk entitled \"What the sugar coating on your cells is trying to tell you\".[36]\n\n\n\n### Biotechnology startups[edit]\n\n\nIn 2001, Bertozzi and Steve Rosen co-founded **Thios Pharmaceuticals** in Emeryville, California, the first company to target sulfation pathways.[37] Thios Pharmaceuticals dissolved in 2005.[38]\n\n\nIn 2008, Bertozzi founded a startup of her own: **Redwood Bioscience** also in Emeryville, California.[39] Redwood Bioscience is a biotechnology company that uses SMARTag, a site-specific protein modification technology that allows small drugs to attach to sites on the proteins and can be used to help fight cancers.[20][40] Redwood Bioscience was acquired by Catalent Pharma Solutions in 2014. Bertozzi remains a part of the advisory board for the biologics sector of the company.[40]\n\n\nIn 2014, she co-founded **Enable Biosciences**[28] of South San Francisco, California.[41] It focuses on biotechnologies for at-home diagnoses for type 1 diabetes, HIV, and other diseases.[28][42]\n\n\nBertozzi became a co-founder of **Palleon Pharma** of Waltham, Massachusetts, in 2015.[43] Palleon Pharma focuses on investigating glycoimmune checkpoint inhibitors as a potential treatment for cancer.[44]\n\n\nIn 2017, Bertozzi helped found **InterVenn Biosciences**, which uses mass spectrometry and artificial intelligence to enhance glycoproteomics for target and biomarker discovery, ovarian cancer diagnostics, and predicting the successes and failures of clinical trials.[28][45]\n\n\nShe co-founded Grace Science Foundation in 2018. The foundation focuses on curing NGLY1 deficiency through developing therapeutics that are efficient and inexpensive.[46]\n\n\nIn 2019, she co-founded both OliLux Biosciences and Lycia Therapeutics. OliLux Biosciences develops new methods for tuberculosis detection.[28][47] The founding of Lycia Therapeutics occurred when Bertozzi's group discovered lysosome-targeting chimeras (LYTACs). The new molecule class may be able to degrade some cardiovascular disease and cancer targets.[48] Lycia Therapeutics focuses on developing technology which utilizes lysosome-targeting chimeras (LYTACs).[28]\n\n\nBertozzi also previously served on the research advisory board of several pharmaceutical companies including GlaxoSmithKline, and until 2021 Eli Lilly.[49]\n\n\n\n### Publications[edit]\n\n\nBertozzi has over 600 publications on Web of Science; the most cited are:\n\n\n\n* Sletten, EM; Bertozzi, CR (2009). \"Bioorthogonal Chemistry: Fishing for Selectivity in a Sea of Functionality\". *Angewandte Chemie International Edition in English*. **48** (38): 6974–98. doi:10.1002/anie.200900942.

Because their father was a physics professor, when asked what she and her sisters wanted to be when they grew up, the answer was unanimous: a nuclear physicist. The three girls would attend MIT camps, as their father dreamt that they would attend MIT due to a \"mixture of pride and the promise of free tuition.\" To William's dismay, Carolyn attended Harvard instead because the school offered strengths outside of just science.[23]\n\n\nBertozzi briefly considered a career in music. In high school, she won several awards for music compositions and musical accomplishments. Her talent on the keyboard earned her offers as a music major from several university rock bands, but she felt that she was \"always centered on the sciences\".[23] Bertozzi is a lesbian and has been out since the late 1980s.[91]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Prescher, Jennifer Ann (2006). *Probing Glycosylation in Living Animals with Bioorthogonal Chemistries* (PhD thesis).
