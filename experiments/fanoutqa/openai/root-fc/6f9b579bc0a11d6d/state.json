It lists the highest attendance of all English non-League, English Football League and Premier League clubs, for a home match above a highest attendance of 5,000. It is noticeable that a large proportion of records were set at matches in the FA Cup.\n\n\nGround capacities have declined for many clubs since all-seater stadia were introduced in the late 1980s, especially at older grounds, with many records set at the terraced stadia, with their high standing capacities, that were replaced. In several cases records were achieved at a former ground rather than the club's current location. For example, Wigan Athletic's record was set at Springfield Park, not their current home, the DW Stadium.\n\n\nThe record home attendance for five clubs occurred away from their usual home grounds. Manchester United's record home attendance was set at Maine Road, the home of neighbours Manchester City, during a period when United's Old Trafford was being rebuilt following bomb damage sustained during the Second World War.[1] During the 1998\u201399 season Arsenal played their UEFA Champions League home matches at Wembley,[2] with the 73,707 attendance against Lens exceeding the record for Highbury and Tottenham Hotspur also played their UEFA Champions League games at Wembley Stadium in the 2016\u201317 season.[3] Similarly, Accrington Stanley's record home attendance was set when the club played an FA Cup home tie at Blackburn's Ewood Park instead of their usual home (the Crown Ground) and Stevenage's record was set when the club played a \"home\" FA Cup tie against Birmingham City at Birmingham's St Andrew's ground.[4]\n\n\n\n## List[edit]\n\n\n*Records correct as of 23 March 2018. Italics denote attendance record set at ground not designated as usual home ground; **Bold** denote attendance record set at current ground.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank | Club | Attendance | Stadium |

However, this was changed in 1997 to allow the runners-up of the stronger leagues to compete as well, and again in 1999 when third and fourth-placed teams of the said leagues also became eligible.[3] In the Champions League era, the defending champions of the competition did not automatically qualify until the rules were changed in 2005 to allow title holders Liverpool to enter the competition.[4]\n\n\nTeams that have won the UEFA Champions League three consecutive times, or five times overall, receive a multiple-winner badge.[5] Six teams have earned this privilege: Real Madrid, Ajax, Bayern Munich, AC Milan, Liverpool, and Barcelona.[6] Until 2009, clubs that had earned that badge were allowed to keep the European Champion Clubs' Cup and a new one was commissioned;[7] since 2009, the winning team each year has received a full-size replica of the trophy, while the original is retained by UEFA.[8]\n\n\nA total of 23 clubs have won the Champions League/European Cup. Real Madrid hold the record for the most victories, having won the competition fourteen times, including the inaugural edition. They have also won the competition the most consecutive times, with five straight titles from 1956 to 1960. Juventus have been runners-up the most times, losing seven finals. Atl\u00e9tico Madrid is the only team to reach three finals without having won the trophy while Reims and Valencia have finished as runners-up twice without winning. Spain has provided the most champions, with nineteen wins from two clubs.[9] England have produced fifteen winners from a record six clubs and Italy have produced twelve winners from three clubs. English teams were banned from the competition for five years following the Heysel disaster in 1985.[10] The current champions are Manchester City, who beat Inter Milan 1\u20130 in the 2023 final.[11]\n\n\n\n\n## List of finals[edit]\n\n\n\n\nKey\n| \u2020\n | Match was won during extra time |\n| \\*\n | Match was won on a penalty shoot-out |\n| &\n | Match was won after a replay

After his appointment in November 2001, Ancelotti took Milan to the 2003 Champions League final, where they defeated Juventus on penalties to win the club's sixth European Cup.[38] The team then won the Scudetto in 2003\u201304 before reaching the 2005 Champions League final, where they were beaten by Liverpool on penalties despite leading 3\u20130 at half-time.[38] Two years later, the two teams met again in the 2007 Champions League final, with Milan winning 2\u20131 to lift the title for a seventh time.[38][39] The team then won its first FIFA Club World Cup in December 2007.[40] In 2009, after becoming Milan's second longest serving manager with 420 matches overseen,[40] Ancelotti left the club to take over as manager at Chelsea.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMilan's away kit has always been completely white, sometimes adorned with various types of decorations, the most common of which are one vertical or horizontal red and black stripe.[72] The white away kit is considered by both the fans and the club to be a lucky strip in Champions League finals, due to the fact that Milan has won six finals out of eight in an all white strip (losing only to Ajax in 1995 and Liverpool in 2005), and only won one out of three in the home strip. The third strip, which is rarely used, changes yearly, being mostly black with red trimmings.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| \"I can't think of many shirts out there that are as recognisable as Milan's. \u2013 Our kits go beyond just the sphere of football.\"\u2014\u200aIn an interview with SoccerBible, Milan player Gianluca Lapadula complimented the iconic design of *Rossoneri*.[73]\n |\n\n\n* ![First logo of the \"Milan Foot-Ball and Cricket Club\", used from 1899 to 1916](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nAC Milan seasons\n |\n| --- |\n| * 1899\u20131900\n |\n| * 1900\u201301\n* 1901\u201302\n* 1902\u201303\n* 1903\u201304\n* 1904\u201305\n* 1905\u201306\n* 1906\u201307\n* 1907\u201308\n* 1908\u201309\n* 1909\u201310\n |\n| * 1910\u201311\n* 1911\u201312\n* 1912\u201313\n* 1913\u201314\n* 1914\u201315\n* 1915\u201316\n* 1916\u201317\n* 1917\u201318\n* 1918\u201319\n* 1919\u201320\n |\n| * 1920\u201321\n* 1921\u201322\n* 1922\u201323\n* 1923\u201324\n* 1924\u201325\n* 1925\u201326\n* 1926\u201327\n* 1927\u201328\n* 1928\u201329\n* 1929\u201330\n |\n| * 1930\u201331\n* 1931\u201332\n* 1932\u201333\n* 1933\u201334\n* 1934\u201335\n* 1935\u201336\n* 1936\u201337\n* 1937\u201338\n* 1938\u201339\n* 1939\u201340\n |\n| * 1940\u201341\n* 1941\u201342\n* 1942\u201343\n* 1943\u201344\n* 1944\u201345\n* 1945\u201346\n* 1946\u201347\n* 1947\u201348\n* 1948\u201349\n* 1949\u201350\n |\n| * 1950\u201351\n* 1951\u201352\n* 1952\u201353\n* 1953\u201354\n* 1954\u201355\n* 1955\u201356\n* 1956\u201357\n* 1957\u201358\n* 1958\u201359\n* 1959\u201360\n |\n| * 1960\u201361\n* 1961\u201362\n* 1962\u201363\n* 1963\u201364\n* 1964\u201365\n* 1965\u201366\n* 1966\u201367\n* 1967\u201368\n* 1968\u201369\n* 1969\u201370\n |\n| * 1970\u201371\n* 1971\u201372\n* 1972\u201373\n* 1973\u201374\n* 1974\u201375\n* 1975\u201376\n* 1976\u201377\n* 1977\u201378\n* 1978\u201379\n* 1979\u201380\n |\n| * 1980\u201381\n* 1981\u201382\n* 1982\u201383\n* 1983\u201384\n* 1984\u201385\n* 1985\u201386\n* 1986\u201387\n* 1987\u201388\n* 1988\u201389\n* 1989\u201390\n |\n| * 001990\u201391\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n38. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"Teams of the Decade #14: Milan 2002\u201307\". *Zonal Marking*. 22 January 2010.

Both clubs meet in the widely anticipated Derby della Madonnina twice every Serie A season. The name of the derby refers to the Blessed Virgin Mary, whose statue atop the Milan Cathedral is one of the city's main attractions. The first match was held in the final of the Chiasso Cup of 1908, a football tournament played in Canton Ticino, Switzerland, on 18 October of that year; the Rossoneri won 2\u20131.[93] The rivalry reached its highest point in the 1960s, when the two clubs dominated the scene both domestically and internationally. In Italy they cumulatively won five Serie A titles, while internationally they collected four European cups. On the bench it showcased the clash of two different approaches to Catenaccio by the two managers: Nereo Rocco for Milan and Helenio Herrera for Inter. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn 19 December 2005, Milan vice-president and executive director Adriano Galliani announced that the club was seriously working towards a relocation.

As opposed to many other stadiums in Italy, Milan's new stadium would likely be used for football only, having no athletics track. On 11 December 2014, Barbara Berlusconi announced a proposal to build a property stadium of 42,000 seats in Portello, behind the new HQ of the Rossoneri, and the large square \"Piazza Gino Valle\". \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)AC Milan celebrating after winning the European Cup Winners' Cup final in 1968\nIn 1908, Milan experienced a split caused by internal disagreements over the signing of foreign players, which led to the forming of another Milan-based team, F.C. Internazionale.[25] Following these events, Milan did not manage to win a single domestic title until 1950\u201351,[10] with some exceptions represented by the 1915\u201316 *Coppa Federale*[26] and the 1917\u201318 *Coppa Mauro*,[27] two tournaments played during the First World War which, especially the former, received a lot of attention and proved to be highly competitive, despite them not being officially recognized by the Italian federation.\n\n\n\n### Return to victory and international affirmation (1950\u20131970)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe rivalry with Juventus F.C. is a rivalry between the two most titled teams in Italy. The challenge confronts also two of the clubs with the greater basin of supporters as well as those with the greatest turnover and stock market value in the country.[95] Milan and Juventus were often fighting for the top positions of the Serie A standings. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNote: Re-capitalization figures were obtained from item *versamenti soci in conto capitale e/o copertura perdite*, for 2006 to 2017 financial year\n\n\n\n## Superleague Formula[edit]\n\n\nMain article: AC Milan (Superleague Formula team)\n\nMilan took part in three editions of the Superleague Formula, from 2008 to 2010. This car competition involved the participation of professional racing teams sponsored by international football teams. The Rossoneri supported the Dutch team Scuderia Playteam in the first season, then Azerti Motorsport in 2009 and the Atech Grand Prix in 2010. The team took several victories and pole positions, and finished third in the final standings of the 2008 championship with Robert Doornbos, former Minardi and Red Bull driver in the Formula 1 World Championship, as main driver.[177] In the same year, Doornbos achieved his team's first victory at the N\u00fcrburgring circuit in Germany. Giorgio Pantano drove for Milan in the 2009 season and he has also won races for the team.[178]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the 1991\u201392 season, the club achieved the feature of being the first team to win the Serie A title without losing a single game. Previously, only Perugia had managed to go unbeaten over an entire Serie A season (1978\u201379), but finished second in the table. In total, Milan's unbeaten streak lasted 58 games, starting with a 0\u20130 draw against Parma on 26 May 1991 and coincidentally ending with a 1\u20130 home loss to Parma on 21 March 1993. This is a Serie A record as well as the third-longest unbeaten run in top flight European football, coming in behind Steaua Bucure\u0219ti's record of 104 unbeaten games and Celtic's 68 game unbeaten run.[103][104]\n\n\nSince 2007, along with Boca Juniors, Milan has won more FIFA recognised international club titles than any other club in the world with 18 titles.[105] They were overtaken by Al Ahly SC from Egypt after their 2014 CAF Confederation Cup win.[106]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nSerie A\n |\n| --- |\n| 2024\u201325 clubs | * Atalanta\n* Bologna\n* Cagliari\n* Como\n* Empoli\n* Fiorentina\n* Genoa\n* Hellas Verona\n* Inter Milan\n* Juventus\n* Lazio\n* Lecce\n* AC Milan\n* Monza\n* Napoli\n* Parma\n* Roma\n* Torino\n* Udinese\n* Venezia\n |\n| Former clubs | * Alessandria\n* Ancona\n* Ascoli\n* Avellino\n* Bari\n* Benevento\n* Brescia\n* Carpi\n* Casale\n* Catania\n* Catanzaro\n* Cesena\n* Chievo\n* Cremonese\n* Crotone\n* Foggia\n* Frosinone\n* Lecco\n* Legnano\n* Livorno\n* Lucchese\n* Mantova\n* Messina\n* Modena\n* Novara\n* Padova\n* Palermo\n* Perugia\n* Pescara\n* Piacenza\n* Pisa\n* Pistoiese\n* Pro Patria\n* Pro Vercelli\n* Reggiana\n* Reggina\n* Salernitana\n* Sampdoria\n* Sassuolo\n* Siena\n* SPAL\n* Spezia\n* Ternana\n* Treviso\n* Triestina\n* Varese\n* Vicenza\n |\n| Organisations | * Lega Serie ADefunct: Lega Calcio\n* Lega Alta Italia\n* Direttorio Superiore\n* Lega Nord\n |\n| Competition | * Teams\n\t+ winners\n* Players\n\t+ foreign\n* Managers\n* Stadia\n |\n| Statistics and awards | * Records\n* Serie A Awards\n* Coach of the Month\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n94. **^** \"Milan game ended by crowd trouble\".

An image of a red devil was used as Milan's logo at one point with a *Golden Star for Sport Excellence* located next to it.[69] As is customary in Italian football, the star above the logo was awarded to the club after winning 10 league titles, in 1979. The official Milan logos have always displayed the Flag of Milan, which was originally the flag of Saint Ambrose,[69] next to red and black stripes. The modern badge used today represents the club colours and the flag of the *Comune di Milano*, with the acronym *ACM* at the top and the foundation year (1899) at the bottom.[69] For what concerns the badge worn on match kits, from the origins to the mid 1940s it was simply the flag of Milan. For many decades no club logo was displayed, with the exception of the devil's logo in the early 1980s. The club badge made its definitive appearance on the match strips in the 1995\u201396, in a form that remained basically unchanged until present days.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe current shirts are supplied by Puma. Previously it was supplied by German sportswear manufacturer Adidas, whose deal was scheduled to run until 2023.[147] The deal made Adidas the official manufacturer of all kits, training equipment and replica outfits. However, an early termination of the deal was announced in October 2017,[148] effective on 30 June 2018. Prior to Adidas, the Italian sports company Lotto produced Milan's sportswear.\n\n\nAs a consequence of the aggregate 2.5-year financial result in the reporting periods ending at 31 December 2015, 31 December 2016 and 30 June 2017 (a FFP-adjusted net loss of \u20ac146\u00a0million, \u20ac121\u00a0million in excess of the acceptable deviation in the regulation[149]:\u200a9), Milan was initially banned from European competitions due to breach in UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations. However, the European ban was lifted by an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.[149] Milan was allowed to achieve the break even condition on or before 30 June 2021.[150]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring this period, the club was involved in the *Calciopoli* scandal, where five teams were accused of fixing matches by selecting favourable referees.[41] A police inquiry excluded any involvement of Milan managers;[42] the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) unilaterally decided that it had sufficient evidence to charge Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani. As a result, Milan was initially punished with a 15-point deduction and was banned from the 2006\u201307 UEFA Champions League. An appeal saw that penalty reduced to eight points,[43] which allowed the club to retain its Champions League participation.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn the pitch the stage was taken by some of the biggest stars the Italian Serie A could offer: players such as Gianni Rivera, Giovanni Trapattoni and Jos\u00e9 Altafini for Milan and Sandro Mazzola, Giacinto Facchetti and Luis Su\u00e1rez (footballer, born 1935) for Inter. The match usually creates a lively atmosphere, with numerous (often humorous or offensive) banners unfolded before the start of the game. Flares are commonly present and contribute to the spectacle but they have occasionally led to problems, including the abandonment of the second leg of the 2004\u201305 Champions League quarter-final match between Milan and Inter on 12 April 2005, after a flare thrown from the crowd by an Inter supporter struck Milan goalkeeper Dida on the shoulder.[94]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe only match played by the two teams in European competitions was the 2003 UEFA Champions League final, the first such final between two Italian clubs, won by Milan at the penalties, which granted Milan the sixth Champions League title of their history.[96]\n\n\nThe rivalry with Genoa started at the dawn of the 20th century, when the two clubs repeatedly faced each other for the Italian championship and other important trophies of the time. It then continued in the 1981-82 Serie A season, when Genoa avoided relegation in Naples just a few minutes from the final whistle of the last game of the season condemning the *Rossoneri* to the second Serie B season of their history. The rivalry worsened in 1995 after Genoa fan Vincenzo Spagnolo was stabbed to death by a Milan supporter.[97] Milan also have rivalries with Fiorentina, Atalanta and Napoli.\n\n\n\n## Popular culture[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nIntercontinental Cup winners\n |\n| --- |\n| 1960s | * **1960:** ![Spain](image) Real Madrid\n* **1961:** ![Uruguay](image) Pe\u00f1arol\n* **1962:** ![Brazil](image) Santos\n* **1963:** ![Brazil](image) Santos\n* **1964:** ![Italy](image) Inter Milan\n* **1965:** ![Italy](image) Inter Milan\n* **1966:** ![Uruguay](image) Pe\u00f1arol\n* **1967:** ![Argentina](image) Racing\n* **1968:** ![Argentina](image) Estudiantes de La Plata\n* **1969:** ![Italy](image) AC Milan\n |\n| 1970s | * **1970:** ![Netherlands](image) Feyenoord\n* **1971:** ![Uruguay](image) Nacional\n* **1972:** ![Netherlands](image) Ajax\n* **1973:** ![Argentina](image) Independiente\n* **1974:** ![Spain](image) Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\n* **1976:** ![West Germany](image) Bayern Munich\n* **1977:** ![Argentina](image) Boca Juniors\n* **1979:** ![Paraguay](image) Olimpia\n |\n| 1980s | * **1980:** ![Uruguay](image) Nacional\n* **1981:** ![Brazil](image) Flamengo\n* **1982:** ![Uruguay](image) Pe\u00f1arol\n* **1983:** ![Brazil](image) Gr\u00eamio\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Alfred Edwards, the first chairman of the club in 1899\u20131909\nMilan has had numerous chairmen[nb 4] over the course of its history.

It could not be defined as a stadium, as there were no dressing rooms, no stands and no other facilities. In 1903, Milan moved to the *Acquabella* pitch, where the stands consisted of a section of ground raised for the purpose. Milan played there until 1905. The following year the club moved to the *Porta Monforte* pitch, where they played until 1914. The stadium was furnished with a ticket office and wooden stands. In the following years Milan played at the *Velodromo Sempione* from 1914 to 1920, and at the *Viale Lombardia* stadium from 1920 to 1926. The latter was a modern structure, with a big main stand and which hosted several games of the Italy national football team.[81]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSince its foundation, the AC Milan home kit consisted of a red and black striped shirt, combined with white shorts and black socks; over the course of the decades, only cyclical changes dictated by the fashions of the time affected this pattern, which remained almost unchanged up to present days. In the first decade of the 20th century, the Rossoneri's first kit was a simple silk shirt characterized by thin stripes, with the badge of the city of Milan sewn at heart level. From the 1910s, the stripes were enlarged following a pattern that would remain unchanged until the late 1950s. The 1960s marked a return to the origins, with the use of thin stripes. This style would last until the 1985-86 season, with a small intermezzo from 1980 to 1982, when the stripes changed to a middle size again. A notable innovation occurred in this period. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFollowing the aftermath of Calciopoli, local rivals Internazionale dominated Serie A, winning four Scudetti. However, with the help a strong squad boasting players such as Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107, Robinho and Alexandre Pato joining many of the veterans of the club's mid-decade European successes, Milan recaptured the Scudetto in the 2010\u201311 Serie A season, their first since the 2003\u201304 season and 18th overall.[44][45]\n\n\n\n### Changes in ownership and decline (2012\u20132019)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jerseys of Paolo Maldini (number 3), Kak\u00e1 (number 22) and Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 (number 11) in the San Siro museum\nAfter their 18th Scudetto, the club declined in performance. Milan failed to qualify to European competitions for a few years, and the only trophy won was the 2016 Supercoppa Italiana, achieved under Vincenzo Montella's coaching after defeating Juventus in the penalty shoot-out.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 1950s saw the club return to the top of Italian football, headed by the famous Gre-No-Li Swedish trio Gunnar Gren, Gunnar Nordahl and Nils Liedholm. This was one of the club's most successful periods domestically, with the Scudetto going to Milan in 1951, 1955, 1957 and 1959.[10] This decade witnessed also the first European successes of Milan, with the triumphs in the 1951 and 1956 Latin Cup. Milan was also the first Italian club to take part to the newly born European Cup in the 1955\u201356 season, and reached the final two years later, when they were defeated by Real Madrid.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn honour of its English origins, the club has retained the English spelling of the city's name, as opposed to the Italian spelling Milano, which it was forced to bear under the fascist regime. Milan won its first Italian championship in 1901, interrupting a three-year hegemony of Genoa, and a further two in succession in 1906 and 1907.[7] The club proved successful in the first decade of its existence, with several important trophies won, including, among others, the *Medaglia del Re* three times,[22] the *Palla Dapples* 23 times[23] and the *FGNI tournament* five times, a competition organized by the Italian Gymnastics Federation but not officially recognized by the Italian Football Federation.[24]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n139. **^** \u5b98\u65b9\uff1a\u674e\u52c7\u9e3f\u6210\u4e3aAC\u7c73\u5170\u4ff1\u4e50\u90e8\u7b2c22\u4efb\u4e3b\u5e2d. *\u4f53\u575b+* (in Chinese (China)). 14 April 2017.

The metro area comprised a functional urban area consisting of a contiguous urban sprawl, labour pool, and commuter Travel to work areas. The analysis defined this metropolitan area as Liverpool itself, combined with the surrounding areas of Birkenhead, Wigan/Ashton, Warrington, Widnes/Runcorn, Chester, Southport, Ellesmere Port, Ormskirk and Skelmersdale.[216]\n\n\nLiverpool and Manchester are sometimes considered as one large polynuclear metropolitan area,[217][218][219] or megalopolis.\n\n\n\n### Ethnicity[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1.

The city is part of a broader metropolitan area that is the fifth largest in the United Kingdom, with a population of 2.24\u00a0million.[9] A historic port city, Liverpool lies on the eastern side of the Mersey Estuary adjacent to the Irish Sea. The city was an important part of the Industrial Revolution in Great Britain and a vital hub for trade. The city celebrated its 800th anniversary in 2007 and was named the 2008 European Capital of Culture.[10] Its selection was credited with kickstarting an economic renaissance in the region.[11] The city's modern economy has a significant influence on the knowledge sector, maritime industry, tourism, culture, hospitality, healthcare industry, life sciences, advanced manufacturing, the creative and digital sectors.[12][13][14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Goodison Park, home of Everton F.C. After leaving Anfield in 1892,  Everton moved to Goodison Park on the opposite side of Stanley Park. The ground was opened on 24 August 1892, by Lord Kinnaird and Frederick Wall of the FA but the first crowds to attend the ground saw a short athletics meeting followed by a selection of music and a fireworks display. Everton's first game there was on 2 September 1892 when they beat Bolton 4\u20132. It was one of the host venues during the 1966 FIFA World Cup. It now has the capacity for just under 40,000 spectators all-seated, but the last expansion took place in 1994 when a new Park End Stand gave the stadium an all-seater capacity. The Goodison Road Stand dates back to the 1970s, while the Gwladys Steet Stand and Bullens Road Stand are refurbished pre-Second World War structures.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNorth of the city centre is Stanley Dock, home to the Stanley Dock Tobacco Warehouse, which was at the time of its construction in 1901, the world's largest building in terms of area[329] and today stands as the world's largest brick-work building.[330]\n\n\nOne of the most famous locations in Liverpool is the Pier Head, renowned for the trio of buildings \u2013 the Royal Liver Building, the Cunard Building and the Port of Liverpool Building \u2013 which sit upon it. Collectively referred to as the *Three Graces*, these buildings stand as a testament to the great wealth in the city during the late 19th and early 20th century. Built in a variety of architectural styles, they are recognised as being the symbol of 'maritime Liverpool' and are regarded by many as contributing to one of the most impressive waterfronts in the world.[331][332][333][334]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWell established festivals in the city include Africa Oy\u00e9 and Brazilica which are the UK's largest free African and Brazilian music festivals respectively.[452][453] The dance music festival Creamfields was established by the Liverpool-based Cream clubbing brand which started life as a weekly event at Nation nightclub. There are numerous music venues located across the city, however, the Liverpool Arena is by far the largest. Opened in 2008, the 11,000-seat arena hosted the MTV Europe Music Awards the same year, and since then has played host to world-renowned acts such as Andrea Bocelli, Beyonc\u00e9, Elton John, Kanye West, Kasabian, The Killers, Lady Gaga, Oasis, Pink, Rihanna, and UB40.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Religion of Liverpool residents, 2021 |\n| --- |\n|  |  |  |\n| Christian |  | 57.3% |\n| No religion |  | 29.4% |\n| Religion not stated |  | 5.9% |\n| Muslim |  | 5.3% |\n| Hindu |  | 0.8% |\n| Buddhist |  | 0.4% |\n| Any other religion |  | 0.4% |\n| Jewish |  | 0.4% |\n| Sikh |  | 0.1% |\n| Source: 2021 census[239] |\n\n![](image)\nLiverpool Anglican Cathedral, one of the largest cathedrals in the world\n![](image)\nLiverpool Metropolitan Cathedral of Christ the King\n![](image)\nThe Al-Rahma Mosque in the Toxteth area of Liverpool\n![](image)\nPrinces Road Synagogue, Toxteth\n\nThe thousands of migrants and sailors passing through Liverpool resulted in a religious diversity that is still apparent today.

One of the oldest surviving buildings is Speke Hall, a Tudor manor house located in the south of the city, which was completed in 1598.[349] The building is one of the few remaining timber framed Tudor houses left in the north of England and is particularly noted for its Victorian interiors, which were added in the mid-19th century.[350] In addition to Speke Hall, many of the city's other oldest surviving buildings are also former manor houses including Croxteth Hall and Woolton Hall, which were completed in 1702 and 1704 respectively.[351]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n181. **^** \"The Draft Liverpool Local Plan September 2016\" (PDF). *liverpool.gov.uk*.

The great wealth this brought then allowed for the development of grand civic buildings, which were designed to allow the local administrators to 'run the city with pride'.[339]\n\n\nThe commercial district is centred on the Castle Street, Dale Street and Old Hall Street areas of the city, with many of the area's roads still following their medieval layout.

Influenced by American rhythm and blues and rock music, they also in turn strongly affected American music. The Beatles became internationally known in the early 1960s and performed around the world together; they were, and continue to be, the most commercially successful and musically influential band in popular history.

In 1974, it became a metropolitan borough in the newly created metropolitan county of Merseyside and  Lieutenancy of Merseyside. \n\n\nFollowing the Local Government Act 1985, The Merseyside County Council was abolished on 31 March 1986 and its functions were devolved to the five metropolitan borough councils of Merseyside and joint-boards. As a result, Liverpool is a unitary authority within the ceremonial county of Merseyside, which is served by the Lord Lieutenant of Merseyside.\n\n\nMost recently, it became a constituent local authority within the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority, in 2014.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy the 2020s, urban regeneration throughout the city continues.

This figure increased to 500,500 people by 2022, according to data from Liverpool City Council.\n\n\nTaking in to account how local government is organised within the cities and metropolitan areas of England, the city of Liverpool was the fifth largest of England's 'core cities' and had the second overall highest population density of those, by 2021.[196][197][198]\n\n\nThe population of the city has steadily risen since the 2001 Census.

Less well known is that the city industrialised early, taking off in 1833, when Catalonia's already sophisticated textile industry began to use steam power. It became the first and most important industrial city in the Mediterranean basin.

These networks and lines are run by a number of different operators but they are integrated into a coordinated fare system, administered by the Autoritat del Transport Metropolit\u00e0 (ATM). The system is divided into fare zones (1 to 6) and various Integrated Travel Cards are available.[151]\n\n\nThe Barcelona Metro network comprises twelve lines, identified by an \"L\" followed by the line number as well as by individual colours. The Metro largely runs underground; eight Metro lines are operated on dedicated track by the Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona (TMB), whilst four lines are operated by the Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya (FGC) and some of them share tracks with RENFE commuter lines.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBarcelona's cultural roots go back 2000 years. Since the arrival of democracy, the Catalan language (very much repressed during the dictatorship of Franco) has been promoted, both by recovering works from the past and by stimulating the creation of new works. Barcelona is designated as a world-class city by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network.[135] It has also been part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network as a City of Literature since 2015.[136]\n\n\n\n### Entertainment and performing arts[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of theatres and concert halls in Barcelona\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCity in Catalonia, Spain\n\nThis article is about the city in Spain.

The increased cost of housing has led to a slight decline (\u221216.6%) in the population over the last two decades of the 20th century as many families move out into the suburbs. This decline has been reversed since 2001, as a new wave of immigration (particularly from Latin America and from Morocco) has gathered pace.[59]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n102. **^** \"Top 100 Cities Destination Ranking\". blog.euromonitor.com. 21 January 2013.

Sunshine duration is 2,524\u00a0hours per year, from 138 (average 4.5\u00a0hours of sunshine a day) in December to 310 (average 10\u00a0hours of sunshine a day) in July.[72]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Airport | * Barcelona\u2013El Prat Airport\n* Sabadell Airport (*domestic flights*)\n |\n| Seaport | * Port of Barcelona\n |\n| Leisure | * Bicing\n* Bus (Tourist)\n* Montju\u00efc Cable Car\n* Montju\u00efc Funicular\n* Port Vell Aerial Tramway\n* Tibidabo Funicular\n* Vallvidrera Funicular\n |\n| * ![](image) Category\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMunicipalities of Barcelon\u00e8s\n |\n| --- |\n| * Badalona\n* Barcelona\n* L'Hospitalet de Llobregat\n* Sant Adri\u00e0 de Bes\u00f2s\n* Santa Coloma de Gramenet\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n168. **^** Parcs i Jardins, Institut Municipal. \"Parcs i Jardins> Els Parcs> Els Parcs de Barcelona\".

The urban parks alone cover 10% of the city (549.7\u00a0ha or 1,358.3 acres).[65] The total park surface grows about 10\u00a0ha (25 acres) per year,[169] with a proportion of 18.1\u00a0m2 (195\u00a0sq\u00a0ft) of park area per inhabitant.[170]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe province has the largest Muslim community in Spain, 322,698 people in Barcelona province are of Muslim religion.[89] A considerable number of Muslims live in Barcelona due to immigration (169\u00a0locations, mostly professed by Moroccans in Spain).[86] In 2014, 322,698 out of 5.5\u00a0million people in the province of Barcelona identified themselves as Muslim,[89] which makes 5.6% of the total population.\n\n\nThe city also has the largest Jewish community in Spain, with an estimated 3,500 Jews living in the city.[90] There are also a number of other groups, including Evangelical (71\u00a0locations, mostly professed by Roma), Jehovah's Witnesses (21\u00a0Kingdom Halls), Buddhists (13\u00a0locations),[91] and Eastern Orthodox.[92]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\n### General information[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBarcelona was the leading slave trade centre of the Crown of Aragon up until the 15th century, when it was eclipsed by Valencia.[42] It initially fed from eastern and Balkan slave stock later drawing from a Maghribian and, ultimately, Subsaharan pool of slaves.[43]\n\n\nThe Bank or Taula de canvi de Barcelona, often viewed as the oldest public bank in Europe, was established by the city magistrates in 1401.

Many of the buildings date from medieval times, some from as far back as the Roman settlement of Barcelona. Catalan *modernista* architecture (related to the movement known as Art Nouveau in the rest of Europe) developed between 1885 and 1950 and left an important legacy in Barcelona. Several of these buildings are World Heritage Sites. Especially remarkable is the work of architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed, which can be seen throughout the city. His best-known work is the immense but still unfinished church of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, which has been under construction since 1882 and is still financed by private donations. As of 2015[update], completion is planned for 2026.[160]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBarcelona is also home to numerous social centres and illegal squats that effectively form a shadow society mainly made up of the unemployed, immigrants, dropouts, anarchists, anti-authoritarians and autonomists.[143] Peter Gelderloos estimates that there around 200 squatted buildings and 40 social centres across the city with thousands of inhabitants, making it one of the largest squatter movements in the world. He notes that they pirate electricity, internet and water allowing them to live on less than one euro a day. He argues that these squats embrace an anarcho-communist and anti-work philosophy, often freely fixing up new houses, cleaning, patching roofs, installing windows, toilets, showers, lights and kitchens. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe city also has a thriving alternative music scene, with groups such as The Pinker Tones receiving international attention.[138] Barcelona is an international hub of highly active and diverse nightlife with bars, dance bars and nightclubs staying open well past midnight.[139]\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\n*El Peri\u00f3dico de Catalunya*, *La Vanguardia* and *Ara* are Barcelona's three major daily newspapers (the first two with Catalan and Spanish editions, *Ara* only in Catalan) while *Sport* and *El Mundo Deportivo* (both in Spanish) are the city's two major sports daily newspapers, published by the same companies. The city is also served by a number of smaller publications such as *Ara* and *El Punt Avui* (in Catalan), by nationwide newspapers with special Barcelona editions like *El Pa\u00eds* (in Spanish, with an online version in Catalan) and *El Mundo* (in Spanish), and by several free newspapers like *20 minutos* and *Qu\u00e8* (all bilingual).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Barcelona as seen by the European Space Agency's Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission\nBarcelona is located on the northeast coast of the Iberian Peninsula, facing the Mediterranean Sea, on a plain approximately 5\u00a0km (3\u00a0mi) wide limited by the mountain range of Collserola, the Llobregat river to the southwest and the Bes\u00f2s river to the north.[64] This plain covers an area of 170\u00a0km2 (66\u00a0sq\u00a0mi),[64] of which 101\u00a0km2 (39.0\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)[65] are occupied by the city itself. It is 120\u00a0km (75\u00a0mi) south of the Pyrenees and the Catalan border with France.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nToday, the headquarters and a large factory of SEAT (the largest Spanish automobile manufacturer) are in one of its suburbs. There is also a Nissan factory in the logistics and industrial area of the city.[120] The factory of Derbi, a large manufacturer of motorcycles, scooters and mopeds, also lies near the city.[121]\n\n\nAs in other modern cities, the manufacturing sector has long since been overtaken by the services sector, though it remains very important. The region's leading industries are textiles, chemical, pharmaceutical, motor, electronic, printing, logistics, publishing, in telecommunications industry and culture the notable Mobile World Congress, and information technology services.\n\n\n\n### Fashion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Brandery fashion show of 2011\nMain article: Fashion in Barcelona\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBarcelona has many venues for live music and theatre, including the world-renowned Gran Teatre del Liceu opera house, the Teatre Nacional de Catalunya, the Teatre Lliure and the Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana concert hall. Barcelona also is home to the Barcelona Symphony and Catalonia National Orchestra (Orquestra Simf\u00f2nica de Barcelona i Nacional de Catalunya, usually known as OBC), the largest symphonic orchestra in Catalonia. In 1999, the OBC inaugurated its new venue in the brand-new Auditorium (L'Auditori). It performs around 75 concerts per season and its current director is Eiji Oue.[137] It is home to the Barcelona Guitar Orchestra, directed by Sergi Vicente. The major thoroughfare of La Rambla is home to mime artists and street performers. Yearly, two major pop music festivals take place in the city, the S\u00f3nar Festival and the Primavera Sound Festival. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nImportant Roman vestiges are displayed in Pla\u00e7a del Rei underground, as a part of the Barcelona City History Museum (MUHBA); the typically Roman grid plan is still visible today in the layout of the historical centre, the *Barri G\u00f2tic* (Gothic Quarter). Some remaining fragments of the Roman walls have been incorporated into the cathedral.[34] The cathedral, Catedral Bas\u00edlica Metropolitana de Barcelona, is also sometimes called *La Seu*, which simply means cathedral (and see, among other things) in Catalan.[35][36] It is said to have been founded in 343.\n\n\n\n### Medieval Barcelona[edit]\n\n\nThe city was conquered by the Visigoths in the early 5th century, becoming for a few years the capital of all Hispania. After being conquered by the Umayyads in the early 8th century, it was conquered after a siege in 801 by Charlemagne's son Louis, who made Barcelona the seat of the Carolingian \"Hispanic March\" (*Marca Hispanica*), a buffer zone ruled by the Count of Barcelona.[37]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n45. **^** Payne, Stanley G.

The National Museum of Art of Catalonia possesses a well-known collection of Romanesque art, while the Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art focuses on post-1945 Catalan and Spanish art. The Fundaci\u00f3 Joan Mir\u00f3, Picasso Museum, and Fundaci\u00f3 Antoni T\u00e0pies hold important collections of these world-renowned artists, as well as the Can Framis Museum, focused on post-1960 Catalan Art owned by Fundaci\u00f3 Vila Casas. Several museums cover the fields of history and archaeology, like the Barcelona City History Museum (MUHBA), the Museum of the History of Catalonia, the Archeology Museum of Catalonia, the Maritime Museum of Barcelona, the Music Museum of Barcelona and the privately owned Egyptian Museum. The Erotic museum of Barcelona is among the most peculiar ones, while CosmoCaixa is a science museum that received the European Museum of the Year Award in 2006.[164]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Torre Gl\u00f2ries and the 22@Barcelona business and innovation district\nThe Barcelona metropolitan area comprises over 66% of the people of Catalonia, one of the richer regions in Europe and the fourth richest region per capita in Spain, with a GDP per capita amounting to \u20ac28,400 (16% more than the EU average).

Leaving the remaining 90% or slightly below 1.5\u00a0million inhabitants living on the remaining 52\u00a0km2 (20\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) at an average density close to 28,500 inhabitants per square kilometre.[79][*full citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* **Sarajevo**,\u00a0Bosnia and Herzegovina\n* **Skopje**,\u00a0North Macedonia\n* **Sofia**,\u00a0Bulgaria\n* **Stockholm**,\u00a0Sweden\n* **Tallinn**,\u00a0Estonia\n* **Tbilisi**,\u00a0Georgia3\n* **Tirana**,\u00a0Albania\n* **Vaduz**,\u00a0Liechtenstein\n* **Valletta**,\u00a0Malta\n* **Vatican City**5\n* **Vienna**,\u00a0Austria\n* **Vilnius**,\u00a0Lithuania\n* **Warsaw**,\u00a0Poland\n* **Yerevan**,\u00a0Armenia3\n* **Zagreb**,\u00a0Croatia\n |\n| States withlimited recognition | * ***North Nicosia**,\u00a0Northern Cyprus*3\n* ***Pristina**,\u00a0Kosovo*\n* ***Stepanakert**,\u00a0Republic of Artsakh*3\n* ***Sukhumi**,\u00a0Abkhazia*3\n* ***Tiraspol**,\u00a0Transnistria*\n* ***Tskhinvali**,\u00a0South Ossetia*3\n |\n| Dependencies | \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| United Kingdom | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe result was a large-scale immigration from poorer regions of Spain (particularly Andalusia, Murcia and Galicia), which in turn led to rapid urbanisation.\n\n\n\n### Late twentieth century[edit]\n\n\nIn 1992, Barcelona hosted the Summer Olympics. The after-effects of this are credited with driving major changes in what had, up until then, been a largely industrial city. As part of the preparation for the games, industrial buildings along the sea-front were demolished and 3\u00a0km (2\u00a0mi) of beach were created. New construction increased the road capacity of the city by 17%, the sewage handling capacity by 27% and the amount of new green areas and beaches by 78%. Between 1990 and 2004, the number of hotel rooms in the city doubled. Perhaps more importantly, the outside perception of the city was changed making, by 2012, Barcelona the 12th most popular city destination in the world and the 5th amongst European cities.[50][51][52][53][54]\n\n\n\n### Recent history[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* ![](image)\u00a0This article\u00a0incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain:\u00a0Smith, William, ed.

FGC operates the Funicular de Tibidabo up the hill of Tibidabo and the Funicular de Vallvidrera (FGC), while TMB runs the Funicular de Montju\u00efc up Montju\u00efc. The city has two aerial cable cars: the Montju\u00efc Cable Car, which serves Montju\u00efc castle, and the Port Vell Aerial Tramway that runs via Torre Jaume I and Torre Sant Sebasti\u00e0 over the port.\n\n\n\n### Bus[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n74. **^** \"Valores climatol\u00f3gicos normales.
