The city has 16 boroughs or *demarcaciones territoriales*, which are in turn divided into neighborhoods or *colonias*.\n\n\nThe 2020 population for the city proper was 9,209,944,[7] with a land area of 1,495 square kilometers (577 sq mi).[14] According to the most recent definition agreed upon by the federal and state governments, the population of Greater Mexico City is 21,804,515, which makes it the sixth-largest metropolitan area in the world, the second-largest urban agglomeration in the Western Hemisphere (behind São Paulo, Brazil), and the largest Spanish-speaking city (city proper) in the world.[15] Greater Mexico City has a GDP of $411 billion in 2011, which makes it one of the most productive urban areas in the world.[16] The city was responsible for generating 15.8% of Mexico's GDP, and the metropolitan area accounted for about 22% of the country's GDP.[17] If it were an independent country in 2013, Mexico City would be the fifth-largest economy in Latin America.[18]\n\n\nMexico's capital is both the oldest capital city in the Americas and one of two founded by Indigenous people.[b] The city was originally built on a group of islands in Lake Texcoco by the Mexica (Aztecs) around 1325, under the name Tenochtitlan. It was almost completely destroyed in the 1521 siege of Tenochtitlan and subsequently redesigned and rebuilt in accordance with the Spanish urban standards. In 1524, the municipality of Mexico City was established, known as *México Tenochtitlán*,[19] and as of 1585, it was officially known as *Ciudad de México* (Mexico City).[19] Mexico City was the political, administrative, and financial center of a major part of the Spanish colonial empire.[20] After independence from Spain was achieved, the federal district was created in 1824.\n\n\nAfter years of demanding greater political autonomy, residents were finally given the right to elect both a head of government and the representatives of the unicameral Legislative Assembly by election in 1997. Ever since, left-wing parties (first the Party of the Democratic Revolution and later the National Regeneration Movement) have controlled both of them.[21] The city has several progressive policies,[22][23] such as elective abortions,[24] a limited form of euthanasia,[25] no-fault divorce,[26] and same-sex marriage.[27] On 29 January 2016, it ceased to be the *Federal District* (Spanish: *Distrito Federal* or *D.F.*) and is now officially known as *Ciudad de México* (or *CDMX*), with a greater degree of autonomy.[28][29] A clause in the Constitution of Mexico, however, prevents it from becoming a state within the Mexican federation, as it is the seat of power in the country, unless the capital of the country were to be relocated elsewhere.[30]\n\n\n\n\n## Nicknames and mottos[edit]\n\n\nMexico City was traditionally known as *La Ciudad de los Palacios* (\"the City of the Palaces\"), a nickname attributed to Baron Alexander von Humboldt when visiting the city in the 19th century, who, sending a letter back to Germany, said Mexico City could rival any major city in Europe. But it was English politician Charles Latrobe who really penned the following: \"... look at their works: the moles, aqueducts, churches, roads—and the luxurious *City of Palaces* which has risen from the clay-builts ruins of Tenochtitlan...\", on page 84 of the Letter V of *The Rambler in Mexico*.[31]\n\n\nDuring the colonial period, the city's motto was \"Muy Noble e Insigne, Muy Leal e Imperial\" (Very Noble and Distinguished, Very Loyal and Imperial).[32][33] During Andrés Manuel López Obrador's administration a political slogan was introduced: *la Ciudad de la Esperanza* (\"The City of Hope\"). This motto was quickly adopted as a city nickname but has faded since the new motto, *Capital en Movimiento* (\"Capital in Movement\"), was adopted by the administration headed by Marcelo Ebrard, though the latter is not treated as often as a nickname in media. \nUp until 2013, it was common to refer to the city by the initialism \n\"DF\" from \"Distrito Federal de México\". Since 2013, the abbreviation \"CDMX\" (Ciudad de México) has been more common, particularly in relation to government campaigns.\n\n\nThe city is colloquially known as *Chilangolandia* after the locals' nickname *chilangos*.[34] Chilango is used pejoratively by people living outside Mexico City to \"connote a loud, arrogant, ill-mannered, loutish person\".[35] For their part those living in Mexico City designate insultingly those who live elsewhere as living in *la provincia* (\"the provinces\", the periphery) and many proudly embrace the term chilango.[36] Residents of Mexico City are more recently called *defeños* (deriving from the postal abbreviation of the Federal District in Spanish: D.F., which is read \"De-Efe\"). They are formally called *capitalinos* (in reference to the city being the capital of the country), but \"[p]erhaps because capitalino is the more polite, specific, and correct word, it is almost never utilized\".[37]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Mexico City\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Mexico City.\n\nThe oldest signs of human occupation in the area of Mexico City are those of the \"Peñón woman\" and others found in San Bartolo Atepehuacan (Gustavo A. Madero). They were believed to correspond to the lower Cenolithic period (9500–7000 BC).[38] However, a 2003 study placed the age of the Peñon woman at 12,700 years old (calendar age),[39] one of the oldest human remains discovered in the Americas. Studies of her mitochondrial DNA suggest she was either of Asian[40] or European[41] or Aboriginal Australian origin.[42]\n\n\nThe area was the destination of the migrations of the Teochichimecas during the 8th and 13th centuries, people that would give rise to the Toltec, and Mexica (Aztecs) cultures. The latter arrived around the 14th century to settle first on the shores of the lake.\n\n\n\n### Aztec period[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mexico-Tenochtitlan\n\nSee also: List of pre-columbian archaeological sites in Mexico City\n\n![](image)The city was the place of Mexico-Tenochtitlan, the Aztec capital.\nThe city of Mexico-Tenochtitlan was founded by the Mexica people in 1325 or 1327.[43] The old Mexica city that is now referred to as Tenochtitlan was built on an island in the center of the inland lake system of the Valley of Mexico, which is shared with a smaller city-state called Tlatelolco.[44] According to legend, the Mexicas' principal god, Huitzilopochtli, indicated the site where they were to build their home by presenting a golden eagle perched on a prickly pear devouring a rattlesnake.[45]\n\n\nBetween 1325 and 1521, Tenochtitlan grew in size and strength, eventually dominating the other city-states around Lake Texcoco and in the Valley of Mexico. When the Spaniards arrived, the Aztec Empire had reached much of Mesoamerica, touching both the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean.[45]\n\n\n\n### Spanish conquest[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Storming of the Teocalli by Cortez and his Troops* (1848) by Emanuel Leutze.\nAfter landing in Veracruz, Spanish explorer Hernán Cortés advanced upon Tenochtitlan with the aid of many of the other native peoples,[46]\narriving there on 8 November 1519.[47] Cortés and his men marched along the causeway leading into the city from Iztapalapa (Ixtapalapa), and the city's ruler, Moctezuma II, greeted the Spaniards; they exchanged gifts, but the camaraderie did not last long.[48] Cortés put Moctezuma under house arrest, hoping to rule through him.[49]\n\n\nTensions increased until, on the night of 30 June 1520 – during a struggle known as \"La Noche Triste\" – the Aztecs rose up against the Spanish intrusion and managed to capture or drive out the Europeans and their Tlaxcalan allies.[50] Cortés regrouped at Tlaxcala. The Aztecs thought the Spaniards were permanently gone, and they elected a new king, Cuitláhuac, but he soon died; the next king was Cuauhtémoc.[51] Cortés began a siege of Tenochtitlan in May 1521. For three months, the city suffered from the lack of food and water as well as the spread of smallpox brought by the Europeans.[46] Cortés and his allies landed their forces in the south of the island and slowly fought their way through the city.[52] Cuauhtémoc surrendered in August 1521.[46] The Spaniards practically razed Tenochtitlan during the final siege of the conquest.[47]\n\n\nCortés first settled in Coyoacán, but decided to rebuild the Aztec site to erase all traces of the old order.[47] He did not establish a territory under his own personal rule, but remained loyal to the Spanish crown. The first Spanish viceroy arrived in Mexico City fourteen years later. By that time, the city had again become a city-state, having power that extended far beyond its borders.[53] Although the Spanish preserved Tenochtitlan's basic layout, they built Catholic churches over the old Aztec temples and claimed the imperial palaces for themselves.[53] Tenochtitlan was renamed \"Mexico\" because the Spanish found the word easier to pronounce.[47]\n\n\n\n### Growth of colonial Mexico City[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of colonial churches in Mexico City and List of colonial non-religious buildings in Mexico City\n\n![](image)Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral's (1571–1813) 18th century painting. The cathedral was built by the Spaniards over the ruins of the main Aztec temple.\nThe city had been the capital of the Aztec Empire and in the colonial era, Mexico City became the capital of New Spain. The viceroy of Mexico or vice-king lived in the viceregal palace on the main square or Zócalo. The Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral, the seat of the Archbishopric of New Spain, was constructed on another side of the Zócalo, as was the archbishop's palace, and across from it the building housing the city council or *ayuntamiento* of the city. A late seventeenth-century painting of the Zócalo by Cristóbal de Villalpando depicts the main square, which had been the old Aztec ceremonial center. The existing central plaza of the Aztecs was effectively and permanently transformed to the ceremonial center and seat of power during the colonial period, and remains to this day in modern Mexico, the central plaza of the nation. The rebuilding of the city after the siege of Tenochtitlan was accomplished by the abundant indigenous labor in the surrounding area. Franciscan friar Toribio de Benavente Motolinia, one of the Twelve Apostles of Mexico who arrived in New Spain in 1524, described the rebuilding of the city as one of the afflictions or plagues of the early period:\n\n\n\n\n> The seventh plague was the construction of the great City of Mexico, which, during the early years used more people than in the construction of Jerusalem. The crowds of laborers were so numerous that one could hardly move in the streets and causeways, although they are very wide. Many died from being crushed by beams, or falling from high places, or in tearing down old buildings for new ones.[54]\n> \n> \n\n\n![](image)Mexico City in 1690. Atlas Van der Hagen.\nPreconquest Tenochtitlan was built in the center of the inland lake system, with the city reachable by canoe and by wide causeways to the mainland. The causeways were rebuilt under Spanish rule with indigenous labor. Colonial Spanish cities were constructed on a grid pattern, if no geographical obstacle prevented it. In Mexico City, the Zócalo (main square) was the central place from which the grid was then built outward. The Spanish lived in the area closest to the main square in what was known as the *traza*, in orderly, well laid-out streets. Indigenous residences were outside that exclusive zone and houses were haphazardly located.[55] Spaniards sought to keep indigenous people separate but since the Zócalo was a center of commerce for Amerindians, they were a constant presence in the central area, so strict segregation was never enforced.[56] At intervals Zócalo was where major celebrations took place as well as executions. It was also the site of two major riots in the seventeenth century, one in 1624, the other in 1692.[57]\n\n\nThe city grew as the population did, coming up against the lake's waters. As the depth of the lake water fluctuated, Mexico City was subject to periodic flooding. A major labor draft, the *desagüe*, compelled thousands of indigenous over the colonial period to work on infrastructure to prevent flooding. Floods were not only an inconvenience but also a health hazard, since during flood periods human waste polluted the city's streets. By draining the area, the mosquito population dropped as did the frequency of the diseases they spread. However, draining the wetlands also changed the habitat for fish and birds and the areas accessible for indigenous cultivation close to the capital.[58] The 16th century saw a proliferation of churches, many of which can still be seen today in the historic center.[53]\nEconomically, Mexico City prospered as a result of trade. Unlike Brazil or Peru, Mexico had easy contact with both the Atlantic and Pacific worlds. Although the Spanish crown tried to completely regulate all commerce in the city, it had only partial success.[59]\n\n\n\n![](image)Palacio de Minería, Mexico City. The elevation of silver mining as a profession and the ennoblement of silver miners was a development of the eighteenth-century Bourbon Reforms.\nThe concept of nobility flourished in New Spain in a way not seen in other parts of the Americas. Spaniards encountered a society in which the concept of nobility mirrored that of their own. Spaniards respected the indigenous order of nobility and added to it. In the ensuing centuries, possession of a noble title in Mexico did not mean one exercised great political power, for one's power was limited even if the accumulation of wealth was not.[60] The concept of nobility in Mexico was not political but rather a very conservative Spanish social one, based on proving the worthiness of the family. Most of these families proved their worth by making fortunes in New Spain outside of the city itself, then spending the revenues in the capital, building churches, supporting charities and building extravagant palatial homes. The craze to build the most opulent residence possible reached its height in the last half of the 18th century. Many of these palaces can still be seen today, leading to Mexico City's nickname of \"The city of palaces\" given by Alexander Von Humboldt.[47][53][60]\n\n\nThe Grito de Dolores (\"Cry of Dolores\"), also known as El Grito de la Independencia (\"Cry of Independence\"), marked the beginning of the Mexican War of Independence. The Battle of Guanajuato, the first major engagement of the insurgency, occurred four days later. After a decade of war, Mexico's independence from Spain was effectively declared in the Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire on 27 September 1821.[61] Agustín de Iturbide is proclaimed Emperor of the First Mexican Empire by Congress, crowned in the Cathedral of Mexico. Unrest followed for the next several decades, as different factions fought for control of Mexico.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe Mexican Federal District was established by the new government and by the signing of their new constitution, where the concept of a federal district was adapted from the United States Constitution.[62] Before this designation, Mexico City had served as the seat of government for both the State of Mexico and the nation as a whole. Texcoco de Mora and then Toluca became the capital of the State of Mexico.[63]\n\n\n\n### Battle of Mexico City in the U.S.–Mexican War of 1847[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*The American assault on the Chapultepec Castle*, 1847 by Nebel and Bayot\nDuring the 19th century, Mexico City was the center stage of all the political disputes of the country. It was the imperial capital on two occasions (1821–1823 and 1864–1867), and of two federalist states and two centralist states that followed innumerable coups d'états in the space of half a century before the triumph of the Liberals after the Reform War. It was also the objective of one of the two French invasions to Mexico (1861–1867), and occupied for a year by American troops in the framework of the Mexican–American War (1847–1848).\n\n\nThe Battle for Mexico City was the series of engagements from 8 to 15 September 1847, in the general vicinity of Mexico City during the U.S. Mexican War. Included are major actions at the battles of Molino del Rey and Chapultepec, culminating with the fall of Mexico City. The U.S. Army under Winfield Scott scored a major success that ended the war. The American invasion into the Federal District was first resisted during the Battle of Churubusco on 8 August, where the Saint Patrick's Battalion, which was composed primarily of Catholic Irish and German immigrants but also Canadians, English, French, Italians, Poles, Scots, Spaniards, Swiss, and Mexicans, fought for the Mexican cause, repelling the American attacks. After defeating the Saint Patrick's Battalion, the Mexican–American War came to a close after the United States deployed combat units deep into Mexico resulting in the capture of Mexico City and Veracruz by the U.S. Army's 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Divisions.[64] The invasion culminated with the storming of Chapultepec Castle in the city itself.[65]\n\n\nDuring this battle, on 13 September, the 4th Division, under John A. Quitman, spearheaded the attack against Chapultepec and carried the castle. Future Confederate generals George E. Pickett and James Longstreet participated in the attack. Serving in the Mexican defense were the cadets later immortalized as *Los Niños Héroes* (the \"Boy Heroes\"). The Mexican forces fell back from Chapultepec and retreated within the city. Attacks on the Belén and San Cosme Gates came afterwards. The treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed in what is now the far north of the city.[66]\n\n\n\n### Porfirian era (1876–1911)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mexican President and later dictator Porfirio Díaz (second from right) commissioned many of the ornate European style buildings constructed from the 1890–1910 and hoped for Mexico City to eventually rival European cities like Paris in opulence.\nEvents such as the Mexican–American War, the French Intervention and the Reform War left the city relatively untouched and it continued to grow, especially during the rule of President Porfirio Díaz. During this time the city developed a modern infrastructure, such as roads, schools, transportation systems and communication systems. However the regime concentrated resources and wealth into the city while the rest of the country languished in poverty.\n\n\nUnder the rule of Porfirio Díaz, Mexico City experienced a massive transformation. Díaz's goal was to create a city which could rival the great European cities. He and his government came to the conclusion that they would use Paris as a model, while still containing remnants of Amerindian and Hispanic elements. This style of Mexican-French fusion architecture became colloquially known as Porfirian architecture. Porfirian architecture became very influenced by Paris' Haussmannization.\n\n\nDuring this era of Porfirian rule, the city underwent an extensive modernization. Many Spanish Colonial style buildings were destroyed, replaced by new much larger Porfirian institutions and many outlying rural zones were transformed into urban or industrialized districts with most having electrical, gas and sewage utilities by 1908. While the initial focus was on developing modern hospitals, schools, factories and massive public works, perhaps the most long-lasting effects of the Porfirian modernization was the construction of the Reforma Avenue. \n\n\nDiaz's plans called for the entire city to eventually be modernized or rebuilt in the Porfirian/French style of the Colonia Roma; but the Mexican Revolution began soon afterward and the plans never came to fruition, with many projects being left half-completed. One of the best examples of this is the Monument to the Mexican Revolution. Originally the monument was to be the main dome of Diaz's new senate hall, but when the revolution erupted only the dome of the senate hall and its supporting pillars were completed, this was subsequently seen as a symbol by many Mexicans that the Porfirian era was over once and for all and as such, it was turned into a monument to victory over Diaz.\n\n\n\n### Mexican Revolution (1910–1920)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Corpses in front of the National Palace during the Ten Tragic Days. Photographer, Manuel Ramos.[67]\nThe capital escaped the worst of the violence of the ten-year conflict of the Mexican Revolution. The most significant episode of this period for the city was the Decena Trágica (\"Ten Tragic Days\") of February 1913, when forces counter to the elected government of Francisco I. Madero staged a successful coup. The center of the city was subjected to artillery attacks from the army stronghold of the *ciudadela* or citadel, with significant civilian casualties and the undermining of confidence in the Madero government. Victoriano Huerta, chief general of the Federal Army, saw a chance to take power, forcing Madero and Pino Suarez to sign resignations. The two were murdered later while on their way to Lecumberri prison.[68] Huerta's ouster in July 1914 saw the entry of the armies of Pancho Villa and Emiliano Zapata, but the city did not experience violence. Huerta had abandoned the capital and the conquering armies marched in. Venustiano Carranza's Constitutionalist faction ultimately prevailed in the revolutionary civil war and Carranza took up residence in the presidential palace.\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera house in San Ángel designed by Juan O'Gorman\nIn the 20th century the phenomenal growth of the city and its environmental and political consequences dominate. In 1900, the population of Mexico City was about 500,000.[69] The city began to grow rapidly westward in the early part of the 20th century.[53] In the 1920s the Caracas exile community was forcefully relocated from Havana to Mexico City. As a consequence, Mexico City became the epicenter of anti-imperialism.[70]\n\n\nThe rapid development of Mexico City as a center for modernist architecture was most fully manifested in the mid-1950s construction of the Ciudad Universitaria, Mexico City, the main campus of the National Autonomous University of Mexico. Designed by the most prestigious architects of the era, including Mario Pani, Eugenio Peschard, and Enrique del Moral, the buildings feature murals by artists Diego Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros, and José Chávez Morado. It has since been recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[71]\n\n\nIn the 1950s Mexico City began to grow upwards, with the Torre Latinoamericana becoming the city's first skyscraper.[46] The 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City are memorable because they triggered one of the earliest anti-Olympic protests.[72]\n\n\nIn 1969 the Mexico City Metro was inaugurated.[46] Explosive growth in the population of the city started in the 1960s, with the population overflowing the boundaries of the Federal District into the neighboring State of Mexico, especially to the north, northwest, and northeast. Between 1960 and 1980 the city's population more than doubled to nearly 9 million.[53]\n\n\nIn 1980 half of all the industrial jobs in Mexico were located in Mexico City. Under relentless growth, the Mexico City government could barely keep up with services. Villagers from the countryside who continued to pour into the city to escape poverty only compounded the city's problems. With no housing available, they took over lands surrounding the city, creating huge shantytowns that extended for many miles.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe inhabitants of Mexico City faced serious air pollution in Mexico City and water pollution problems, as well as groundwater-related subsidence.[73] Air and water pollution has been contained and improved in several areas due to government programs, the renovation of vehicles and the modernization of public transportation.\n\n\n\n![](image)Students in a burned bus during the Tlatelolco massacre 1968\nThe autocratic government that ruled Mexico City since the Revolution was tolerated, mostly because of the continued economic expansion since World War II. This was the case even though this government could not handle the population and pollution problems adequately. Nevertheless, discontent and protests began in the 1960s leading to the massacre of an unknown number of protesting students in Tlatelolco.[74]\n\n\nThree years later, a demonstration in the Maestros avenue, organized by former members of the 1968 student movement, was violently repressed by a paramilitary group called \"Los Halcones\", composed of gang members and teenagers from many sports clubs who received training in the U.S.\n\n\n\n![](image)First ladies Paloma Cordero of Mexico (left) and Nancy Reagan of the United States (right) with U.S. Ambassador to Mexico, John Gavin observing the damage done by the 1985 earthquake\nOn Thursday, 19 September 1985, at 7:19 am Central Standard Time (CST), Mexico City was struck by an 1985 Mexico City earthquake.[75] The earthquake proved to be a disaster politically for the one-party state government. The Mexican government was paralyzed by its own bureaucracy and corruption, forcing ordinary citizens to create and direct their own rescue efforts and to reconstruct much of the housing that was lost as well.[76]\n\n\nHowever, the last straw may have been the controversial elections of 1988. That year, the presidency was set between the P.R.I.'s candidate, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, and a coalition of left-wing parties led by Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas, son of the former president Lázaro Cárdenas. The counting system \"fell\" because coincidentally the power went out and suddenly, when it returned, the winning candidate was Salinas, even though Cárdenas had the upper hand.\n\n\nAs a result of the fraudulent election, Cárdenas became a member of the Party of the Democratic Revolution. Discontent over the election eventually led Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas to become the first elected mayor of Mexico City in 1997. Cárdenas promised a more democratic government, and his party claimed some victories against crime, pollution, and other major problems. He resigned in 1999 to run for the presidency.\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Satellite image of Mexico City\nMexico City is located in the Valley of Mexico, sometimes called the Basin of Mexico. This valley is located in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt in the high plateaus of south-central Mexico.[77][78]\n\n\nIt has a minimum altitude of 2,200 meters (7,200 feet) above sea level and is surrounded by mountains and volcanoes that reach elevations of over 5,000 meters (16,000 feet).[79] This valley has no natural drainage outlet for the waters that flow from the mountainsides, making the city vulnerable to flooding. Drainage was engineered through the use of canals and tunnels starting in the 17th century.[77][79]\n\n\nMexico City primarily rests on what was Lake Texcoco.[77] Seismic activity is frequent there.[80] Lake Texcoco was drained starting from the 17th century. Although none of the lake waters remain, the city rests on the lake bed's heavily saturated clay. This soft base is collapsing due to the over-extraction of groundwater, called *groundwater-related subsidence*.\n\n\nSince the beginning of the 20th century the city has sunk as much as nine meters (30 feet) in some areas. On average Mexico City sinks 20 inches (1 foot and 8 inches) or 50 centimetres (1/2 meters) every year.[81] This sinking is causing problems with runoff and wastewater management, leading to flooding problems, especially during the summer.[79][80][82] The entire lake bed is now paved over and most of the city's remaining forested areas lie in the southern boroughs of Milpa Alta, Tlalpan and Xochimilco.[80]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Mexico City geophysical maps\n |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Topography\n | Hydrology\n | Climate patterns\n |\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Water management in Greater Mexico City\n\n![](image)Trajineras in the canals of Xochimilco. Xochimilco and the historic center of Mexico City were declared a World Heritage Site in 1987.\nOriginally much of the valley lay beneath the waters of Lake Texcoco, a system of interconnected salt and freshwater lakes. The Aztecs built dikes to separate the fresh water used to raise crops in *chinampas* and to prevent recurrent floods. These dikes were destroyed during the siege of Tenochtitlan, and during colonial times the Spanish regularly drained the lake to prevent floods. Only a small section of the original lake remains, located outside Mexico City, in the municipality of Atenco, State of Mexico.\n\n\nArchitects Teodoro González de León and Alberto Kalach along with a group of Mexican urbanists, engineers and biologists have developed the project plan for *Recovering the City of Lakes*. If approved by the government the project will contribute to the supply of water from natural sources to the Valley of Mexico, the creation of new natural spaces, a great improvement in air quality, and greater population establishment planning.\n\n\n\n### Pollution[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Air pollution in Mexico City\n\n![](image)Air pollution over Mexico City. Air quality is poorest during the winter.\nBy the 1990s Mexico City had become infamous as one of the world's most polluted cities; however, the city has since become a model for drastically lowering pollution levels. By 2014 carbon monoxide pollution had dropped drastically, while sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide were at levels about a third of those in 1992. The levels of signature pollutants in Mexico City are similar to those of Los Angeles.[83] Despite the cleanup, the metropolitan area is still the most ozone-polluted part of the country, with ozone levels 2.5 times beyond WHO-defined safe limits.[84]\n\n\nTo clean up pollution, the federal and local governments implemented numerous plans including the constant monitoring and reporting of environmental conditions, such as ozone and nitrogen oxides.[85] When the levels of these two pollutants reached critical levels, contingency actions were implemented which included closing factories, changing school hours, and extending the *A day without a car* program to two days of the week.[85] The government also instituted industrial technology improvements, a strict biannual vehicle emission inspection and the reformulation of gasoline and diesel fuels.[85] The introduction of Metrobús bus rapid transit and the Ecobici bike-sharing were among efforts to encourage alternate, greener forms of transportation.[84]\n\n\n\n### Parks and recreation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Chapultepec was an important park during the Aztecs whose access had been limited to its nobility, was declared open to the public by a decree of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor in 1530,[86][87] it is one of the world's largest city parks.[86]\nChapultepec, the city's most iconic public park, has history back to the Aztec emperors who used the area as a retreat. It is south of Polanco district, and houses the Chapultepec Zoo the main city's zoo, several ponds and seven museums, including the National Museum of Anthropology. Other iconic city parks include the Alameda Central, it is recognized as the oldest public park in the Americas.[88][89] Parque México and Parque España in the hip Condesa district; Parque Hundido and *Parque de los Venados* in Colonia del Valle, and Parque Lincoln in Polanco.[90] There are many smaller parks throughout the city. Most are small \"squares\" occupying two or three square blocks amid residential or commercial districts. Several other larger parks such as the Bosque de Tlalpan and Viveros de Coyoacán, and in the east Alameda Oriente, offer many recreational activities. Northwest of the city is a large ecological reserve, the Bosque de Aragón. In the southeast is the Xochimilco Ecological Park and Plant Market, a World Heritage Site. West of Santa Fe district are the pine forests of the Desierto de los Leones National Park. Amusement parks include Six Flags México, in Ajusco neighborhood which is the largest in Latin America. There are numerous seasonal fairs present in the city.\n\n\nMexico City has three zoos. Chapultepec Zoo, the San Juan de Aragon Zoo and Los Coyotes Zoo. Chapultepec Zoo is located in the first section of Chapultepec Park in the Miguel Hidalgo. It was opened in 1924.[91] Visitors can see about 243 specimens of different species including kangaroos, giant panda, gorillas, caracal, hyena, hippos, jaguar, giraffe, lemur, lion, among others.[92] Zoo San Juan de Aragon is near the San Juan de Aragon Park in the Gustavo A. Madero. In this zoo, opened in 1964,[93] there are species that are in danger of extinction such as the jaguar and the Mexican wolf. Other guests are the golden eagle, pronghorn, bighorn sheep, caracara, zebras, African elephant, macaw, hippo, among others.[94] Zoo Los Coyotes is a 27.68-acre (11.2 ha) zoo located south of Mexico City in the Coyoacan. It was inaugurated on 2 February 1999.[95] It has more than 301 specimens of 51 species of wild native or endemic fauna from the area, featuring eagles, ajolotes, coyotes, macaws, bobcats, Mexican wolves, raccoons, mountain lions, teporingos, foxes, white-tailed deer.[96]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lightning in the background of the Torre Mayor\nMexico City has a subtropical highland climate (Köppen climate classification *Cwb*), due to its tropical location but high elevation. The lower region of the valley receives less rainfall than the upper regions of the south; the lower boroughs of Iztapalapa, Iztacalco, Venustiano Carranza and the east portion of Gustavo A. Madero are usually drier and warmer than the upper southern boroughs of Tlalpan and Milpa Alta, a mountainous region of pine and oak trees known as the range of Ajusco. The average annual temperature varies from 12 to 16 °C (54 to 61 °F), depending on the altitude of the borough. The temperature is rarely below 3 °C (37 °F) or above 30 °C (86 °F).[97] At the Tacubaya observatory, the lowest temperature ever registered was −4.4 °C (24 °F) on 13 February 1960, and the highest temperature on record was 33.9 °C (93 °F) on 9 May 1998.[98] Overall precipitation is heavily concentrated in the summer months, and includes dense hail.\n\n\nSnow falls in the city very rarely, although somewhat more often in nearby mountain tops. Throughout its history, the Central Valley of Mexico was accustomed to having several snowfalls per decade (including a period between 1878 and 1895 in which every single year—except 1880—recorded snowfalls[99]) mostly lake-effect snow. The effects of the draining of Lake Texcoco and global warming have greatly reduced snowfalls after the snow flurries of 12 February 1907.[100] Since 1908, snow has only fallen three times, snow on 14 February 1920;[101] snow flurries on 14 March 1940;[102] and on 12 January 1967, when 8 centimeters (3 in) of snow fell on the city, the most on record.[103] The 1967 snowstorm coincided with the operation of *Deep Drainage System* that resulted in the total draining of what was left of Lake Texcoco.[99][104] After the disappearance of Lake Texcoco, snow has never fallen again over Mexico City.[99] The region of the Valley of Mexico receives anti-cyclonic systems. The weak winds of these systems do not allow for the dispersion, outside the basin, of the air pollutants which are produced by the 50,000 industries and 4 million vehicles operating in and around the metropolitan area.[105]\n\n\nThe area receives about 820 millimeters (32 in) of annual rainfall, which is concentrated from May through October with little or no precipitation the remainder of the year.[79] The area has two main seasons. The wet humid summer runs from May to October when winds bring in tropical moisture from the sea, the wettest month being July. The cool sunny winter runs from November to April, when the air is relatively drier, the driest month being December. This season is subdivided into a cold winter period and a warm spring period. The cold period spans from November to February, when polar air masses push down from the north and keep the air fairly dry. The warm period extends from March to May when subtropical winds again dominate but do not yet carry enough moisture for rain to form.[106]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Mexico City (Tacubaya), 1991–2020 normals, extremes 1877–2018\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 28.2(82.8)\n | 33.5(92.3)\n | 32.9(91.2)\n | 33.7(92.7)\n | 33.9(93.0)\n | 33.5(92.3)\n | 29.6(85.3)\n | 29.4(84.9)\n | 28.6(83.5)\n | 29.2(84.6)\n | 31.5(88.7)\n | 29.4(84.9)\n | 33.9(93.0)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 22.3(72.1)\n | 24.2(75.6)\n | 26.0(78.8)\n | 27.3(81.1)\n | 27.1(80.8)\n | 25.7(78.3)\n | 24.4(75.9)\n | 24.5(76.1)\n | 23.6(74.5)\n | 23.3(73.9)\n | 22.7(72.9)\n | 22.3(72.1)\n | 24.5(76.1)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 15.7(60.3)\n | 17.1(62.8)\n | 18.9(66.0)\n | 20.4(68.7)\n | 20.9(69.6)\n | 19.9(67.8)\n | 18.8(65.8)\n | 19.1(66.4)\n | 18.6(65.5)\n | 18.0(64.4)\n | 16.4(61.5)\n | 15.5(59.9)\n | 18.3(64.9)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 8.4(47.1)\n | 9.4(48.9)\n | 11.1(52.0)\n | 13.0(55.4)\n | 13.7(56.7)\n | 13.8(56.8)\n | 13.0(55.4)\n | 13.1(55.6)\n | 13.1(55.6)\n | 11.8(53.2)\n | 9.8(49.6)\n | 8.4(47.1)\n | 11.5(52.7)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −4.2(24.4)\n | −4.4(24.1)\n | −4.0(24.8)\n | −0.6(30.9)\n | 3.7(38.7)\n | 0.0(32.0)\n | 1.0(33.8)\n | 1.0(33.8)\n | 1.0(33.8)\n | 0.0(32.0)\n | −3.0(26.6)\n | −3.0(26.6)\n | −4.4(24.1)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 12.5(0.49)\n | 5.9(0.23)\n | 11.7(0.46)\n | 24.9(0.98)\n | 62.5(2.46)\n | 137.1(5.40)\n | 177.1(6.97)\n | 175.1(6.89)\n | 160.2(6.31)\n | 71.2(2.80)\n | 17.6(0.69)\n | 5.0(0.20)\n | 860.8(33.89)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.1 mm) | 1.9\n | 1.2\n | 2.2\n | 4.3\n | 8.2\n | 13.1\n | 17.2\n | 16.9\n | 14.4\n | 7.2\n | 2.0\n | 0.6\n | 89.2\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 54.0\n | 48.0\n | 43.5\n | 45.2\n | 52.8\n | 63.7\n | 69.6\n | 69.2\n | 69.9\n | 64.0\n | 57.1\n | 55.3\n | 57.7\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 233.4\n | 232.5\n | 262.3\n | 238.6\n | 232.2\n | 180.9\n | 178.6\n | 176.9\n | 148.3\n | 190.9\n | 224.4\n | 226.9\n | 2,525.8\n |\n| Source 1: Servicio Meteorologico Nacional[107][108] |\n| Source 2: World Meteorological Organization (humidity and sun 1981–2010)[109] |\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1950 | 3,365,081 | —     |\n| 1960 | 5,479,184 | +62.8% |\n| 1970 | 8,830,947 | +61.2% |\n| 1980 | 13,027,620 | +47.5% |\n| 1990 | 15,642,318 | +20.1% |\n| 2000 | 18,457,027 | +18.0% |\n| 2010 | 20,136,681 | +9.1% |\n| 2019 | 21,671,908 | +7.6% |\n| for Mexico City Agglomeration:[110] |\n\n\nHistorically, and since Pre-Columbian times, the Valley of Anahuac has been one of the most densely populated areas in Mexico. When the Federal District was created in 1824, the urban area of Mexico City extended approximately to the area of today's Cuauhtémoc borough. At the beginning of the 20th century, the *elites* began migrating to the south and west and soon the small towns of Mixcoac and San Ángel were incorporated by the growing conurbation. According to the 1921 census, 54.78% of the city's population was considered Mestizo (Indigenous mixed with European), 22.79% considered European, and 18.74% considered Indigenous.[111] This was the last Mexican Census which asked people to self-identify with a heritage other than Amerindian. In 1921, Mexico City had less than one million inhabitants.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nUp to the 1990s, the Federal District was the most populous federal entity in Mexico, but since then, its population has remained stable at around 8.7 million. The growth of the city has extended beyond the limits of the city to 59 municipalities of the State of Mexico and 1 in the state of Hidalgo.[112] With a population of approximately 19.8 million inhabitants (2008),[113] it is one of the most populous conurbations in the world. Nonetheless, the annual rate of growth of the Metropolitan Area of Mexico City is much lower than that of other large urban agglomerations in Mexico,[114] a phenomenon most likely attributable to the environmental policy of decentralization. The net migration rate of Mexico City from 1995 to 2000 was negative.[115]\n\n\n\n### Metropolitan area[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Greater Mexico City\n\n![](image)Greater Mexico City and Mexico City\nThe metropolitan area, Greater Mexico City ('Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México' or 'ZMVM' in Spanish) consists of Mexico City itself plus 60 municipalities in the State of Mexico and one in Hidalgo state. With a population of 21,804,515 (2020 census), Greater Mexico City is both the biggest and the densest metropolitan area in the country. Of the ca. 21.8 million, 9.2 million live in Mexico City proper[7] and 12.4 million in the State of Mexico (ca. 75% of the state's population), including the municipalities of:[7]\n\n\n\n* Ecatepec de Morelos (pop. 1,645,352)\n* Nezahualcóyotl (pop. 1,077,208)\n* Naucalpan (pop. 834,434)\n* Chimalhuacán (pop. 705,193)\n* Tlalnepantla de Baz (pop. 672,202)\n\n\n#### Megalopolis[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Mexico City Megalopolis as defined prior to 2019. Since then Querétaro state is also included.\nGreater Mexico City, in turn, forms part of an even larger megalopolis officially termed the *Zona megalopolitana de la ZMVM* (Mexico City megalopolis), with a population of 33.4 million, more than one quarter of the country's population according to the 2020 census. The megalopolis as defined by the Environmental Commission of the Megalopolis (*CAMe*) covers Mexico City and the states of Mexico, Hidalgo, Puebla, Tlaxcala, Morelos, and since 2019, Querétaro,[116] thus encompassing the metropolitan areas of Mexico City, Puebla, Querétaro, Toluca, Cuernavaca, Pachuca, and others.[117]\n\n\n\n#### Growth[edit]\n\n\nGreater Mexico City was the fastest growing metropolitan area in the country until the late 1980s. Since then, government policies have supported decentralization with the aim of reducing pollution in Greater Mexico City. While still growing, the annual rate of growth has decreased and is lower than that of Greater Guadalajara and Greater Monterrey.[114]\n\n\nThe net migration rate of Mexico City proper from 1995 to 2000 was negative,[118] which implies that residents are moving to the suburbs of the metropolitan area, or to other states of Mexico. In addition, some inner suburbs are losing population to outer suburbs, indicating the continuing expansion of Greater Mexico City.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nPanorama of Mexico City from Torre Latinoamericana\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe in La Villa de Guadalupe, the main Catholic pilgrimage site in the Americas. It houses the original image of Our Lady of Guadalupe.\nThe majority (82%) of the residents in Mexico City are Catholic, slightly lower than the 2010 census national percentage of 87%, making it the largest Christian denomination, though it has been decreasing over the last decades.[119] Many other religions and philosophies are also practiced in the city: many different types of Protestant groups, different types of Jewish communities, Buddhist, Islamic and other spiritual and philosophical groups. There are also growing[120] numbers of irreligious people, whether agnostic or atheist.\nThe patron saint of Mexico City is Saint Philip of Jesus, a Mexican Catholic missionary who became one of the Twenty-six Martyrs of Japan.[121]\n\n\nThe Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mexico is the largest archdiocese in the world.[122] There are two Catholic cathedrals in the city, the Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral and the Iztapalapa Cathedral, and three former Catholic churches who are now the cathedrals of other rites, the San José de Gracia Cathedral (Anglican church), the Porta Coeli Cathedral (Melkite Greek Catholic church) and the Valvanera Cathedral (Maronite church).\n\n\n\n### Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nRepresenting around 18.74% of the city's population, indigenous peoples from different areas of Mexico have migrated to the capital in search of better economic opportunities. Nahuatl, Otomi, Mixtec, Zapotec and Mazahua are the indigenous languages with the greatest number of speakers in Mexico City.[123] According to the 2020 Census, 2.03% of Mexico City's population identified as Black, Afro-Mexican, or of African descent.[124]\n\n\nAdditionally, Mexico City is home to large communities of expatriates and immigrants from the rest of North America (U.S. and Canada), from South America (mainly from Argentina and Colombia, but also from Brazil, Chile, Uruguay and Venezuela), from Central America and the Caribbean (mainly from Cuba, Guatemala, El Salvador, Haiti and Honduras); from Europe (mainly from Spain, Germany and Switzerland, but also from Czech Republic, Hungary, France, Italy, Ireland, the Netherlands, Poland and Romania),[125][126] and from the Arab world (mostly from Lebanon, and other countries like Syria and Egypt).[127]\n\n\nMexico City is home to the largest population of Americans living outside the United States. Estimates are as high as 700,000 Americans living in Mexico City, while in 1999 the U.S. Bureau of Consular Affairs estimated over 440,000 Americans lived in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area.[128][129]\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The XXI Century National Medical Center, managed by the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS)\nMexico City is home to some of the best private hospitals in the country, including Hospital Ángeles, Hospital ABC and Médica Sur. The national public healthcare institution for private-sector employees, IMSS, has its largest facilities in Mexico City—including the National Medical Center and the La Raza Medical Center—and has an annual budget of over 6 billion pesos. The IMSS and other public health institutions, including the ISSSTE (Public Sector Employees' Social Security Institute) and the National Health Ministry (SSA) maintain large specialty facilities in the city. These include the National Institutes of Cardiology, Nutrition, Psychiatry, Oncology, Pediatrics, Rehabilitation, among others.\n\n\nThe World Bank has sponsored a project to curb air pollution through public transport improvements and the Mexican government has started shutting down polluting factories. They have phased out diesel buses and mandated new emission controls on new cars; since 1993 all new cars must be fitted with a catalytic converter, which reduces the emissions released. Trucks must use only liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Also construction of an underground rail system was begun in 1968 in order to help curb air pollution problems and alleviate traffic congestion. It has over 201 km (125 mi) of track and carries over 5 million people every day. Fees are kept low to encourage use of the system and during rush hours the crush is so great, that authorities have reserved a special carriage specifically for women. Due to these initiatives and others, the air quality in Mexico City has begun to improve; it is cleaner than it was in 1991, when the air quality was declared to be a public health risk for 355 days of the year.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)El Colegio de México\nUnlike those of Mexican states' schools, curricula of Mexico City's public schools is managed by the federal Secretary of Public Education. The whole funding is allocated by the government of Mexico City (in some specific cases, such as El Colegio de México, funding comes from both the city's government and other public and private national and international entities). The city's public high school system is the *Instituto de Educación Media Superior de la Ciudad de México* (IEMS-DF). A special case is that of El Colegio Nacional, created during the district's governmental period of Miguel Alemán Valdés to have, in Mexico, an institution similar to the College of France.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAmong its many public and private schools (K–13), the city offers multi-cultural, multi-lingual and international schools attended by Mexican and foreign students. Best known are the Colegio Alemán (German school with three main campuses), the Liceo Mexicano Japonés (Japanese), the Centro Cultural Coreano en México (Korean), the Lycée Franco-Mexicain (French), the American School, The Westhill Institute (American School), the Edron Academy and the Greengates School (British). Mexico City joined the UNESCO Global Network of Learning Cities in 2015.[130]\n\n\nIn the Plaza de las Tres Culturas is the Colegio de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco that is recognized for being the first and oldest European school of higher learning in the Americas[131] and the first major school of interpreters and translators in the New World.[132] Other, the now-defunct Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico is considered the father of the UNAM, and it was located in the city and was the third oldest university in the Americas.\n\n\n\n![](image)*The Conquest of Energy* by José Chávez Morado.\nThe National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), located in Mexico City, is the largest university on the continent, with more than 300,000 students from all backgrounds. Three Nobel laureates, several Mexican entrepreneurs and most of Mexico's modern-day presidents are among its former students. UNAM conducts 50% of Mexico's scientific research and has presence all across the country with satellite campuses, observatories and research centers. UNAM ranked 74th in the Top 200 World University Ranking published by Times Higher Education (then called Times Higher Education Supplement) in 2006,[133] making it the highest ranked Spanish-speaking university in the world. The sprawling main campus of the university, known as Ciudad Universitaria, was named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2007.[134]\n\n\nThe second largest higher-education institution is the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN), which includes among many other relevant centers the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav), where varied high-level scientific and technological research is done. Other major higher-education institutions in the city include the Metropolitan Autonomous University (UAM), the National School of Anthropology and History (ENAH), the Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México (ITAM), the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education (3 campuses), the Universidad Panamericana (UP), the Universidad La Salle, the Universidad Intercontinental (UIC), the Universidad del Valle de México (UVM), the Universidad Anáhuac, Simón Bolívar University (USB), the Universidad Intercontinental (UIC), the Alliant International University, the Universidad Iberoamericana, El Colegio de México (Colmex), Escuela Libre de Derecho and the Centro de Investigación y Docencia Económica, (CIDE).\nIn addition, the prestigious University of California maintains a campus known as \"Casa de California\" in the city.[135] The Universidad Tecnológica de México is also in Mexico City.\n\n\n\n## Politics[edit]\n\n\n### Political structure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The National Palace of Mexico\n![](image)Senate of the Republic\n![](image)Legislative Palace of San Lázaro\n![](image)Offices of the Secretariat of Foreign Affairs\n![](image)Mexico City's Legislative Assembly building\nThe Acta Constitutiva de la Federación of 31 January 1824, and the Federal Constitution of 4 October 1824,[136] fixed the political and administrative organization of the United Mexican States after the Mexican War of Independence. In addition, Section XXVIII of Article 50 gave the new Congress the right to choose where the federal government would be located. This location would then be appropriated as federal land, with the federal government acting as the local authority. The two main candidates to become the capital were Mexico City and Querétaro.[137]\n\n\nDue in large part to the persuasion of representative Servando Teresa de Mier, Mexico City was chosen because it was the center of the country's population and history, even though Querétaro was closer to the center geographically. The choice was official on 18 November 1824, and Congress delineated a surface area of two leagues square (8,800 acres) centered on the Zocalo. This area was then separated from the State of Mexico, forcing that state's government to move from the Palace of the Inquisition (now Museum of Mexican Medicine) in the city to Texcoco. This area did not include the population centers of the towns of Coyoacán, Xochimilco, Mexicaltzingo and Tlalpan, all of which remained as part of the State of Mexico.[138]\n\n\nIn 1854 president Antonio López de Santa Anna enlarged the area of Mexico City almost eightfold from the original 220 to 1,700 km2 (80 to 660 sq mi), annexing the rural and mountainous areas to secure the strategic mountain passes to the south and southwest to protect the city in event of a foreign invasion. (The Mexican–American War had just been fought.) The last changes to the limits of Mexico City were made between 1898 and 1902, reducing the area to the current 1,479 km2 (571 sq mi) by adjusting the southern border with the state of Morelos. By that time, the total number of municipalities within Mexico City was twenty-two. In 1941, the General Anaya borough was merged with the Central Department, which was then renamed \"Mexico City\" (thus reviving the name but not the autonomous municipality). From 1941 to 1970, the Federal District comprised twelve *delegaciones* and Mexico City. In 1970, Mexico City was split into four different *delegaciones*: Cuauhtémoc, Miguel Hidalgo, Venustiano Carranza and Benito Juárez, increasing the number of *delegaciones* to 16. Since then, the whole Federal District, whose *delegaciones* had by then almost formed a single urban area, began to be considered *de facto* a synonym of Mexico City.[139]\n\n\nThe lack of a *de jure* stipulation left a legal vacuum that led to a number of sterile discussions about whether one concept had engulfed the other or if the latter had ceased to exist altogether. In 1993, the situation was solved by an amendment to the 44th article of the Constitution of Mexico; Mexico City and the Federal District were stated to be the same entity. The amendment was later introduced into the second article of the Statute of Government of the Federal District.[139]\n\n\nOn 29 January 2016, Mexico City ceased to be the *Federal District* (Spanish: *Distrito Federal* or D.F.), and was officially renamed \"Ciudad de México\" (or \"CDMX\").[28] On that date, Mexico City began a transition to becoming the country's 32nd federal entity, giving it a level of autonomy comparable to that of a state. It will have its own constitution and its legislature, and its *delegaciones* will now be headed by mayors.[28] Because of a clause in the Mexican Constitution, however, as it is the seat of the powers of the federation, it can never become a state, or the capital of the country has to be relocated elsewhere.[30]\n\n\nIn response to the demands, Mexico City received a greater degree of autonomy, with the 1987 elaboration the first Statute of Government (*Estatuto de Gobierno*) and the creation of an assembly of representatives.[140]: 149–150 The city has a Statute of Government, and as of its ratification on 31 January 2017, a constitution,[141][142] similar to the states of the Union. As part of the recent changes in autonomy, the budget is administered locally; it is proposed by the head of government and approved by the Legislative Assembly. Nonetheless, it is the Congress of the Union that sets the ceiling to internal and external public debt issued by the city government.[143]\n\n\nThe politics pursued by the administrations of heads of government in Mexico City at the end of the 20th century have usually been more liberal than those of the rest of the country,[144][145] whether with the support of the federal government, as was the case with the approval of several comprehensive environmental laws in the 1980s, or by laws that were since approved by the Legislative Assembly. The Legislative Assembly expanded provisions on abortions, becoming the first federal entity to expand abortion in Mexico beyond cases of rape and economic reasons, to permit it at the choice of the mother before the 12th week of pregnancy.[146] In December 2009, the then Federal District became the first city in Latin America and one of very few in the world to legalize same-sex marriage.[147]\n\n\n\n### Boroughs and neighborhoods[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Boroughs of Mexico City and Neighborhoods in Mexico City\n\n![](image)The 16 boroughs of Mexico City\nAfter the political reforms in 2016, the city is divided for administrative purposes into 16 boroughs (*demarcaciones territoriales*, colloquially *alcaldías*), formerly called *delegaciones*. While they are not fully equivalent to municipalities, the boroughs have gained significant autonomy.[148] Formerly appointed by the Federal District's head of government, local authorities were first elected directly by plurality in 2000. From 2016, each borough is headed by a mayor, expanding their local government powers.[148]\n\n\nThe boroughs of Mexico City with their 2020 populations are:[149]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1. Álvaro Obregón (pop. 759,137)\n2. Azcapotzalco (pop. 432,205)\n3. Benito Juárez (pop. 434,153)\n4. Coyoacán (pop. 614,447)\n5. Cuajimalpa (pop. 217,686)\n6. Cuauhtémoc (pop. 545,884)\n7. Gustavo A. Madero (pop. 1,173,351)\n8. Iztacalco (pop. 404,695)\n | 9. Iztapalapa (pop. 1,835,486)\n10. La Magdalena Contreras (pop. 247,622)\n11. Miguel Hidalgo (pop. 414,470)\n12. Milpa Alta (pop. 152,685)\n13. Tláhuac (pop. 392,313)\n14. Tlalpan (pop. 699,928)\n15. Venustiano Carranza (pop. 443,704)\n16. Xochimilco (pop. 442,178)\n |\n\n\nThe Human Development Index report of 2005[150] shows that there were three boroughs with a very high Human Development Index, 12 with a high HDI value (9 above .85), and one with a medium HDI value (almost high). Benito Juárez borough had the highest HDI of the country (0.9510) followed by Miguel Hidalgo, which came up fourth nationally with an HDI of (0.9189), and Coyoacán was fifth nationally, with an HDI of (0.9169). Cuajimalpa (15th), Cuauhtémoc (23rd), and Azcapotzalco (25th) also had very high values of 0.8994, 0.8922, and 0.8915, respectively.[150]\n\n\nIn contrast, the boroughs of Xochimilco (172nd), Tláhuac (177th), and Iztapalapa (183rd) presented the lowest HDI values of Mexico City, with values of 0.8481, 0.8473, and 0.8464, respectively, which are still in the global high-HDI range. The only borough that did not have a high HDI was that of rural Milpa Alta, which had a \"medium\" HDI of 0.7984, far below those of all the other boroughs (627th nationally, the rest being in the top 200). Mexico City's HDI for the 2005 report was 0.9012 (very high), and its 2010 value of 0.9225 (very high), or (by newer methodology) 0.8307, was Mexico's highest.[150]\n\n\n\n### Law enforcement[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Law enforcement in Mexico City\n\n![](image)Federal Police headquarters in Mexico City\nThe Secretariat of Public Security of Mexico City (Secretaría de Seguridad Pública de la Ciudad de México – SSP) manages a combined force of over 90,000 officers in Mexico City. The SSP is charged with maintaining public order and safety in the heart of Mexico City. The historic district is also roamed by tourist police, aiming to orient and serve tourists. These horse-mounted agents dress in traditional uniforms. The investigative Judicial Police of Mexico City (Policía Judicial de la Ciudad de México – PJCDMX) is organized under the Office of the Attorney General of Mexico City (the Procuraduría General de Justicia de la Ciudad de México). The PGJCDMX maintains 16 precincts (delegaciones) with an estimated 3,500 judicial police, 1,100 investigating agents for prosecuting attorneys (agentes del ministerio público), and nearly 1,000 criminology experts or specialists (peritos).\n\n\nBetween 2000 and 2004 an average of 478 crimes were reported each day in Mexico City; however, the actual crime rate is thought to be much higher \"since most people are reluctant to report crime\".[151] Under policies enacted by Mayor Marcelo Ebrard between 2009 and 2011, Mexico City underwent a major security upgrade with violent and petty crime rates both falling significantly despite the rise in violent crime in other parts of the country. Some of the policies enacted included the installation of 11,000 security cameras around the city and a very large expansion of the police force. Mexico City has one of the world's highest police officer-to-resident ratios, with one uniformed officer per 100 citizens.[152] Since 1997 the prison population has increased by more than 500%.[153] Political scientist Markus-Michael Müller argues that mostly informal street vendors are hit by these measures. He sees punishment \"related to the growing politicization of security and crime issues and the resulting criminalization of the people living at the margins of urban society, in particular those who work in the city's informal economy\".[153]\n\n\nIn 2016, the incidence of femicides was 3.2 per 100 000 inhabitants, the national average being 4.2.[154] A 2015 city government report found that two of three women over the age of 15 in the capital suffered some form of violence.[155] In addition to street harassment, one of the places where women in Mexico City are subjected to violence is on and around public transport. Annually the Metro of Mexico City receives 300 complaints of sexual harassment.[156] While the violence against women in Mexico City is rising, there is still a large number of incidents of kidnappings and killings that go undetected and unreported due to the corruption in the police department.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### International relations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of twin towns and sister cities in Mexico\n\nMexico City is twinned with:[157][158]\n\n\n\n* ![Peru](image) Cusco, Peru, 1987\n* ![Germany](image) Berlin, Germany, 1993[159]\n* ![Cuba](image) Havana, Cuba, 1997\n* ![Ecuador](image) Quito, Ecuador, 1999\n* ![Honduras](image) Tegucigalpa, Honduras, 1999\n* ![Cuba](image) San Antonio de los Baños, Cuba, 1999\n* ![Cuba](image) Cerro (Havana), Cuba, 1999\n* ![Costa Rica](image) San José, Costa Rica, 2000\n* ![Argentina](image) Buenos Aires, Argentina, 2006\n* ![Japan](image) Nagoya, Japan, 2007\n* ![United States](image) Los Angeles, United States, 2007\n* ![Spain](image) Cádiz, Spain, 2009\n* ![China](image) Beijing, China, 2009\n* ![Turkey](image) Istanbul, Turkey, 2010\n* ![Kuwait](image) Kuwait City, Kuwait, 2011\n* ![United States](image) Chicago, United States[160]\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Paseo de la Reforma is a wide avenue designed by Ferdinand von Rosenzweig in the 1860s and was modeled after the Champs-Élysées in Paris.[161]\nMexico City is one of the most important economic hubs in Latin America. The city proper produces 15.8% of the country's gross domestic product.[162] In 2002, Mexico City had a Human Development Index score of 0.915,[163] identical to that of South Korea. In 2007, residents in the top twelve percent of GDP per capita holders in the city had a mean disposable income of US$98,517. The high spending power of Mexico City inhabitants makes the city attractive for companies offering prestige and luxury goods. According to a 2009 study conducted by PwC, Mexico City had a GDP of $390 billion, ranking it as the eighth richest city in the world and the richest in Latin America.[164] In 2009, Mexico City alone would rank as the 30th largest economy in the world.[165]\n\n\nMexico City is the greatest contributor to the country's industrial GDP (15.8%) and also the greatest contributor to the country's GDP in the service sector (25.3%). Due to the limited non-urbanized space at the south—most of which is protected through environmental laws—the contribution of Mexico City in agriculture is the smallest of all federal entities in the country.[162] The economic reforms of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari had a tremendous effect on the city, as a number of businesses, including banks and airlines, were privatized. He also signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). This led to decentralization[166] and a shift in Mexico City's economic base, from manufacturing to services, as most factories moved away to either the State of Mexico, or more commonly to the northern border. By contrast, corporate office buildings set their base in the city.\n\n\n\n![](image)Mexican Stock Exchange\nMexico City offers an immense and varied consumer retail market, ranging from basic foods to ultra high-end luxury goods. Consumers may buy in fixed indoor markets, in mobile markets (*tianguis*), from street vendors, from downtown shops in a street dedicated to a certain type of good, in convenience stores and traditional neighborhood stores, in modern supermarkets, in warehouse and membership stores and the shopping centers that they anchor, in department stores, in big-box stores, and in modern shopping malls. In addition, \"tianguis\" or mobile markets set up shop on streets in many neighborhoods, depending on day of week. Sundays see the largest number of these markets.\n\n\nThe city's main source of fresh produce is the Central de Abasto. This in itself is a self-contained mini-city in Iztapalapa borough covering an area equivalent to several dozen city blocks. The wholesale market supplies most of the city's \"mercados\", supermarkets and restaurants, as well as people who come to buy the produce for themselves. Tons of fresh produce are trucked in from all over Mexico every day. The principal fish market is known as La Nueva Viga, in the same complex as the Central de Abastos.[167] The world-renowned market of Tepito occupies 25 blocks, and sells a variety of products. A staple for consumers in the city is the omnipresent \"mercado\". Every major neighborhood in the city has its own borough-regulated market, often more than one. These are large well-established facilities offering most basic products, such as fresh produce and meat/poultry, dry goods, tortillerías, and many other services such as locksmiths, herbal medicine, hardware goods, sewing implements; and a multitude of stands offering freshly made, home-style cooking and drinks in the tradition of aguas frescas and atole.\n\n\nStreet vendors ply their trade from stalls in the *tianguis* as well as at non-officially controlled concentrations around metro stations and hospitals; at *plazas comerciales*, where vendors of a certain \"theme\" (e.g. stationery) are housed; originally these were organized to accommodate vendors formerly selling on the street; or simply from improvised stalls on a city sidewalk.[168] In addition, food and goods are sold from people walking with baskets, pushing carts, from bicycles or the backs of trucks, or simply from a tarp or cloth laid on the ground.[169] In the center of the city informal street vendors are increasingly targeted by laws and prosecution.[153] The weekly San Felipe de Jesús Tianguis is reported to be the largest in Latin America.[170]\n\n\nThe Historic Center of Mexico City is widely known for specialized, often low-cost retailers. Certain blocks or streets are dedicated to shops selling a certain type of merchandise, with areas dedicated to over 40 categories such as home appliances, lamps and electricals, closets and bathrooms, housewares, wedding dresses, jukeboxes, printing, office furniture and safes, books, photography, jewelry, and opticians.[171]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nSanta Fe is one of the centers of greatest economic activity in the city.[172]\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Barrios Mágicos of Mexico City\n\n![](image)The Turibus runs through many of the most important tourist attractions in the city.\nMexico City is a destination for many foreign tourists. The Historic center of Mexico City (*Centro Histórico*) and the \"floating gardens\" of Xochimilco in the southern borough have been declared World Heritage Sites by UNESCO. Landmarks in the Historic Center include the Plaza de la Constitución (Zócalo), the main central square with its epoch-contrasting Spanish-era Metropolitan Cathedral and National Palace, ancient Aztec temple ruins Templo Mayor (\"Major Temple\") and modern structures, all within a few steps of one another. (The Templo Mayor was discovered in 1978 while workers were digging to place underground electric cables).\n\n\nThe most recognizable icon of Mexico City is the golden Angel of Independence on the wide, elegant avenue Paseo de la Reforma, modeled by the order of the Emperor Maximilian of Mexico after the Champs-Élysées in Paris. This avenue was designed over the Americas' oldest known major roadway in the 19th century to connect the National Palace (seat of government) with the Castle of Chapultepec, the imperial residence. Today, this avenue is an important financial district in which the Mexican Stock Exchange and several corporate headquarters are located. Another important avenue is the Avenida de los Insurgentes, which extends 28.8 km (17.9 mi) and is one of the longest single avenues in the world.\n\n\nChapultepec Park houses the Chapultepec Castle, now a museum on a hill that overlooks the park and its numerous museums, monuments and the national zoo and the National Museum of Anthropology (which houses the Aztec Calendar Stone). \n\n\n\n![](image)The Aztec sun stone in the National Museum of Anthropology\nAnother piece of architecture is the Palacio de Bellas Artes, a white marble theater/museum whose weight is such that it has gradually been sinking into the soft ground below. Its construction began during the presidency of Porfirio Díaz and ended in 1934, after being interrupted by the Mexican Revolution in the 1920s.\n\n\nThe Plaza de las Tres Culturas, in this square are located the College of Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco, that is the first and oldest European school of higher learning in the Americas,[131] and the archeological site of the city-state of Tlatelolco, and the shrine and Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe are also important sites. There is a double-decker bus, known as the \"Turibus\", that circles most of these sites, and has timed audio describing the sites in multiple languages as they are passed.\n\n\nIn addition, according to the Secretariat of Tourism, the city has about 170 museums—is among the top ten of cities in the world with highest number of museums[173]—over 100 art galleries, and some 30 concert halls, all of which maintain a constant cultural activity during the whole year. Many areas (e.g. Palacio Nacional and the National Institute of Cardiology) have murals painted by Diego Rivera. He and his wife Frida Kahlo lived in Coyoacán, where several of their homes, studios, and art collections are open to the public. The house where Leon Trotsky was initially granted asylum and finally murdered in 1940 is also in Coyoacán. In addition, there are several *haciendas* that are now restaurants, such as the San Ángel Inn, the Hacienda de Tlalpan, Hacienda de Cortés and the Hacienda de los Morales.\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transportation in Mexico City\n\n### Airports[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mexico City International Airport\nMexico City International Airport is Mexico City's primary airport (IATA Airport Code: MEX), and serves as the hub of Aeroméxico (Skyteam). Felipe Ángeles International Airport (IATA Airport Code: NLU) is Mexico City's secondary airport, and was opened in 2022, rebuilt from the former Santa Lucía Air Force Base. It is located in Zumpango, State of Mexico, 48.8 kilometres (30 mi) north-northeast of the historic center of Mexico City by car.[174]\n\n\n\n### Sistema de Movilidad Integrada[edit]\n\n\nIn 2019, the graphic designer Lance Wyman was engaged to create an integrated map of the multimodal public transportation system; he presented a new logo for the Sistema de Movilidad Integrada, describing eight distinct modes of transportation. The head of the government, Claudia Sheinbaum, said the branding would be used for a new single payment card to streamline public transportation fare collection.[175]\n\n\n\n### Metro[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mexico City Metro\nMain article: Mexico City Metro\n\nMexico City is served by the Mexico City Metro, a 225.9 km (140 mi) metro system, which is the largest in Latin America. The first portions were opened in 1969 and it has expanded to 12 lines with 195 stations, transporting 4.4 million people every day.[176]\n\n\n\n### Tren Suburbano[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tren Suburbano\n\nA suburban rail system, the Tren Suburbano serves the metropolitan area, beyond the reach of the metro, with one line serving to municipalities such as Tlalnepantla and Cuautitlán Izcalli, but with future lines planned to serve e.g. Chalco and La Paz.\n\n\nElectric transport other than the metro also exists, in the form of several Mexico City trolleybus routes and the Xochimilco Light Rail line, both of which are operated by Servicio de Transportes Eléctricos. The central area's last streetcar line (tramway, or *tranvía*) closed in 1979.\n\n\n\n### Bus[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Mexico City Metrobús and Red de Transporte de Pasajeros\n\n![](image)Metrobús rapid transit bus stop station at Mina\nMexico City has an extensive bus network, consisting of public buses, bus rapid transit, and trolleybuses.\n\n\n\n### Roads[edit]\n\n\nMexico City has a large road network, and relatively high private car usage, estimated at more than 4.5 million in 2016.[177] There is an environmental program, called Hoy No Circula (\"Today Does Not Run\", or \"One Day without a Car\"), whereby vehicles that have not passed emissions testing are restricted from circulating on certain days according to the ending digit of their license plates, in an attempt to cut down on pollution and traffic congestion.[178][179][180]\n\n\n\n### Cycling[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ecobici (Mexico City)\n\n![](image)Bicycles available for rental in Zona Rosa\nThe Mexico City local government operates North America's second-largest bicycle sharing system, Ecobici. There are, as of September 2013, 276 stations with 4,000 bicycles across an area stretching from the Historic center to Polanco.[181][182][183]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n### Art[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mexican art\n\n![](image)Monument \"To the Meritorious Benito Juárez\", Mexico City\nHaving been capital of a vast pre-Hispanic empire, and also the capital of the richest viceroyalty within the Spanish Empire (ruling over a vast territory in the Americas and Spanish West Indies), and, finally, the capital of the United Mexican States, Mexico City has a rich history of artistic expression. Since the mesoamerican pre-Classical period the inhabitants of the settlements around Lake Texcoco produced many works of art and complex craftsmanship, some of which are today displayed at the world-renowned National Museum of Anthropology and the *Templo Mayor* museum. While many pieces of pottery and stone-engraving have survived, the great majority of the Amerindian iconography was destroyed during the conquest of the Aztec Empire.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nMuch of the early colonial art stemmed from the Aztec codices, aiming to recover and preserve some Aztec and other Amerindian iconography and history. From then, artistic expressions in Mexico were mostly religious in theme. The Metropolitan Cathedral still displays works by Juan de Rojas, Juan Correa and an oil painting whose authorship has been attributed to Murillo.[*citation needed*] Secular works of art of this period include the equestrian sculpture of Charles IV of Spain, locally known as *El Caballito* (\"The little horse\"). This piece, in bronze, was the work of Manuel Tolsá and it has been placed at the Plaza Tolsá, in front of the Palacio de Mineria (Mining Palace). Directly in front of this building is the Museo Nacional de Arte (Munal) (the National Museum of Art).\n\n\n\n![](image)Receptions Hall at the Museo Nacional de Arte\nDuring the 19th century, an important producer of art was the Academia de San Carlos (San Carlos Art Academy), founded during colonial times, and which later became the Escuela Nacional de Artes Plásticas (the National School of Arts) including painting, sculpture and graphic design, one of UNAM's art schools. Many of the works produced by the students and faculty of that time are now displayed in the Museo Nacional de San Carlos (National Museum of San Carlos). One of the students, José María Velasco, is considered one of the greatest Mexican landscape painters of the 19th century. Porfirio Díaz's regime sponsored arts, especially those that followed the French school. Popular arts in the form of cartoons and illustrations flourished, e.g. those of José Guadalupe Posada and Manuel Manilla. The permanent collection of the San Carlos Museum also includes paintings by European masters such as Rembrandt, Velázquez, Murillo, and Rubens.\n\n\nAfter the Mexican Revolution, an avant-garde artistic movement originated in Mexico City: muralism. Many of the works of muralists José Clemente Orozco, David Alfaro Siqueiros and Diego Rivera are displayed in numerous buildings in the city, most notably at the National Palace and the Palacio de Bellas Artes. Frida Kahlo, wife of Rivera, with a strong nationalist expression, was also one of the most renowned of Mexican painters. Her house has become a museum that displays many of her works.[184]\n\n\nThe former home of Rivera muse Dolores Olmedo houses the namesake museum. The facility is in Xochimilco borough in southern Mexico City and includes several buildings surrounded by sprawling manicured lawns. It houses a large collection of Rivera and Kahlo paintings and drawings, as well as living *Xoloizcuintles* (Mexican Hairless Dog). It also regularly hosts small but important temporary exhibits of classical and modern art (e.g. Venetian Masters and Contemporary New York artists).\n\n\nDuring the 20th century, many artists immigrated to Mexico City from different regions of Mexico, such as Leopoldo Méndez, an engraver from Veracruz, who supported the creation of the socialist Taller de la Gráfica Popular (Popular Graphics Workshop), designed to help blue-collar workers find a venue to express their art. Other painters came from abroad, such as Catalan painter Remedios Varo and other Spanish and Jewish exiles. It was in the second half of the 20th century that the artistic movement began to drift apart from the Revolutionary theme. José Luis Cuevas opted for a modernist style in contrast to the muralist movement associated with social politics.\n\n\n\n### Museums[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Reconstruction of the entrance to the Hochob temple in the National Museum of Anthropology\n![](image)Interior of the Museo Nacional de Arte\n  \n\nMexico City has numerous museums dedicated to art, including Mexican colonial, modern and contemporary art, and international art. The Museo Tamayo was opened in the mid-1980s to house the collection of international contemporary art donated by Mexican painter Rufino Tamayo. The collection includes pieces by Picasso, Klee, Kandinsky, Warhol and many others, though most of the collection is stored while visiting exhibits are shown. The Museo de Arte Moderno is a repository of Mexican artists from the 20th century, including Rivera, Orozco, Siqueiros, Kahlo, Gerzso, Carrington, Tamayo, and also regularly hosts temporary exhibits of international modern art. In southern Mexico City, the Carrillo Gil Museum showcases avant-garde artists, as does the Museo Universitario Arte Contemporáneo, designed by Mexican architect Teodoro González de León, inaugurated in late 2008.\n\n\nThe Museo Soumaya, named after the wife of Mexican magnate Carlos Slim, has the largest private collection of original Rodin sculptures outside of France.[185] It also has a large collection of Dalí sculptures, and recently began showing pieces in its masters collection including El Greco, Velázquez, Picasso and Canaletto. The museum inaugurated a new futuristic-design facility in 2011 just north of Polanco, while maintaining a smaller facility in Plaza Loreto in southern Mexico City. The Colección Júmex is a contemporary art museum located on the sprawling grounds of the Jumex juice company in the northern industrial suburb of Ecatepec. It has the largest private contemporary art collection in Latin America and hosts pieces from its permanent collection as well as traveling exhibits. The Museo de San Ildefonso, housed in the Antiguo Colegio de San Ildefonso in Mexico City's historic downtown district is a 17th-century colonnaded palace housing an art museum that regularly hosts world-class exhibits of Mexican and international art. The Museo Nacional de Arte is also located in a former palace in the historic center. It houses a large collection of pieces by all major Mexican artists of the last 400 years and also hosts visiting exhibits.\n\n\nJack Kerouac, the noted American author, spent extended periods of time in the city, and wrote his 1959 masterpiece volume of poetry *Mexico City Blues* here. Another American author, William S. Burroughs, also lived in Colonia Roma where he accidentally shot his wife. Most of Mexico City's museums can be visited from Tuesday to Sunday from 10am to 5pm, although some of them have extended schedules, such as the Museum of Anthropology and History, which is open to 7pm. In addition to this, entrance to most museums are free on Sunday. In some cases a modest fee may be charged.[186]\n\n\nThe Memory and Tolerance Museum, inaugurated in 2011, showcases historical events of discrimination and genocide. Permanent exhibits include those on the Holocaust and other large-scale atrocities. It also houses temporary exhibits; one on Tibet was inaugurated by the Dalai Lama in September 2011.[187]\n\n\n\n### Music, theater and entertainment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The City Theatre built in 1918\nFurther information: Music of Mexico and Regional styles of Mexican music\n\nMexico City is home to a number of orchestras offering season programs. These include the Mexico City Philharmonic,[188] which performs at the Sala Ollin Yoliztli; the National Symphony Orchestra, whose home base is the Palacio de Bellas Artes (Palace of the Fine Arts), a masterpiece of art nouveau and art decó styles; the Philharmonic Orchestra of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (OFUNAM),[189] and the Minería Symphony Orchestra,[190] both of which perform at the Sala Nezahualcóyotl, which was the first wrap-around concert hall in the western hemisphere when inaugurated in 1976. There are also many smaller ensembles that enrich the city's musical scene, including the Carlos Chávez Youth Symphony, the Cuarteto Latinoamericano, the New World Orchestra (Orquesta del Nuevo Mundo), the National Polytechnical Symphony and the Bellas Artes Chamber Orchestra (Orquesta de Cámara de Bellas Artes).\n\n\nThe city is also a leading center of popular culture and music. There are a multitude of venues hosting Spanish and foreign-language performers. These include the 10,000-seat National Auditorium that regularly schedules the Spanish and English-language pop and rock artists, as well as many of the world's leading performing arts ensembles, the auditorium also broadcasts grand opera performances from New York's Metropolitan Opera on giant, high definition screens. In 2007 National Auditorium was selected world's best venue by multiple genre media. Other sites for pop-artist performances include the 3,000-seat Teatro Metropolitan, the 15,000-seat Palacio de los Deportes, and the larger 50,000-seat Foro Sol Stadium, where popular international artists perform on a regular basis. The Cirque du Soleil has held several seasons at the Carpa Santa Fe, in the Santa Fe district in the western part of the city. There are numerous venues for smaller musical ensembles and solo performers. These include the Hard Rock Live, Bataclán, Foro Scotiabank, Lunario, Circo Volador and Voilá Acoustique. Recent additions include the 20,000-seat Arena Ciudad de México, the 3,000-seat Pepsi Center World Trade Center, and the 2,500-seat Auditorio Blackberry.\n\n\nThe Centro Nacional de las Artes (National Center for the Arts) has several venues for music, theater, dance. UNAM's main campus, also in the southern part of the city, is home to the Centro Cultural Universitario (the University Culture Center) (CCU). The CCU also houses the National Library, the interactive Universum, Museo de las Ciencias,[191] the Sala Nezahualcóyotl concert hall, several theaters and cinemas, and the new University Museum of Contemporary Art (MUAC).[192] A branch of the National University's CCU cultural center was inaugurated in 2007 in the facilities of the former Ministry of Foreign Affairs, known as Tlatelolco, in north-central Mexico City.\n\n\n\n![](image)Biblioteca Vasconcelos\nThe José Vasconcelos Library, a national library, is located on the grounds of the former Buenavista railroad station in the northern part of the city. The Papalote Museo del Niño (Kite Children's Museum), which houses the world's largest dome screen, is located in the wooded park of Chapultepec, near the Museo Tecnológico, and La Feria, a former amusement park. The theme park Six Flags México (the largest amusement park in Latin America) is located in the Ajusco neighborhood, in Tlalpan borough, southern Mexico City. During the winter, the main square of the Zócalo is transformed into a gigantic ice skating rink, which is said to be the largest in the world behind that of Moscow's Red Square.\n\n\nThe Cineteca Nacional [es] (Mexican Film Library), near the Coyoacán suburb, shows a variety of films, and stages many film festivals, including the annual International Showcase, and many smaller ones ranging from Scandinavian and Uruguayan cinema, to Jewish and LGBT-themed films. Cinépolis and Cinemex, the two biggest film business chains, also have several film festivals throughout the year, with both national and international movies. Mexico City has a number of IMAX theaters, providing residents and visitors access to films ranging from documentaries to blockbusters on these large screens.\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cuisine of Mexico City\n\n![](image)Tacos at a taco stand\nOnce considered plebeian fare, by the 19th century tacos had become a standard of Mexico City's cuisine. Furthermore, as authorities struggled to tax local taquerias, imposing licensing requirements and penalties, they recorded some details of the types of foods being served by these establishments. The most frequent reference was for *tacos de barbacoa*. Also mentioned are enchiladas, *tacos de minero* and *gorditas*, along with oyster shops and fried fish stands. There is evidence of some regional specialties being made available for recent migrants; at least two shops were known to serve *pozole*, a type of stew similar to hominy that is a staple of Guadalajara, Jalisco.[193] Mexico City is known for having some of the freshest fish and seafood in Mexico's interior. La Nueva Viga Market is the second largest seafood market in the world after the Tsukiji fish market in Japan.\n\n\nMexico City offers a variety of cuisines: restaurants specializing in the regional cuisines of Mexico's 31 states are available in the city, and the city also has several branches of internationally recognized restaurants. These include Paris' Au Pied de Cochon and Brasserie Lipp, Philippe (by Philippe Chow); Nobu, Quintonil, Morimoto; Pámpano, owned by Mexican-raised opera singer Plácido Domingo. There are branches of Japanese restaurant Suntory, Italian restaurant Alfredo, as well as New York steakhouses Morton's and The Palm, and Monte Carlo's BeefBar. Three of Lima's Haute restaurants, serving Peruvian cuisine, have locations in Mexico City: La Mar, Segundo Muelle and Astrid y Gastón.\n\n\nFor the 2019 list of World's 50 Best Restaurants as named by the British magazine *Restaurant*, Mexico City ranked 12th best with the Mexican avant-garde restaurant Pujol (owned by Mexican chef Enrique Olvera). Also notable is the Basque-Mexican fusion restaurant Biko (run and co-owned by Bruno Oteiza and Mikel Alonso), which placed outside the list at 59th, but in previous years has ranked within the top 50.[194] Other that has been placed on the list in 2019 is the restaurant Sud 777 at 58th place.[195] At the other end of the scale are working class pulque bars known as *pulquerías*, a challenge for tourists to locate and experience.\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Televisa headquarters in Mexico City\nMexico City is Mexico's most important hub for the printed media and book publishing industries. Dozens of daily newspapers are published, including *El Universal*, *Excélsior*, *Reforma* and *La Jornada*. Other major papers include *Milenio*, *Crónica*, *El Economista* and *El Financiero*.[196][197] Leading magazines include *Expansión*, *Proceso*, *Poder*, as well as dozens of entertainment publications such as *Vanidades*, *Quién*, *Chilango*, *TV Notas*, and local editions of *Vogue*, *GQ*, and *Architectural Digest*.\n\n\nIt is also a leading center of the advertising industry. Most international ad firms have offices in the city, including Grey, JWT, Leo Burnett, Euro RSCG, BBDO, Ogilvy, Saatchi & Saatchi, and McCann Erickson. Many local firms also compete in the sector, including Alazraki, Olabuenaga/Chemistri, Terán, Augusto Elías, and Clemente Cámara, among others. There are 60 radio stations operating in the city and many local community radio transmission networks.\n\n\nThe two largest media companies in the Spanish-speaking world, Televisa and TV Azteca, are headquartered in Mexico City. Televisa, it often presents itself as the largest producer of Spanish-language content.[198] Other local television channels include:\n\n\nXHDF 1 (Azteca Uno),[199]\nXEW 2 (Televisa W),[200]\nXHCTMX 3,\nXHTV 4,\nXHGC 5,\nXHTDMX 6,\nXHIMT 7,\nXEQ 9,\nXEIPN 11,\nXHUNAM 20,\nXHCDM 21,\nXEIMT 22,\nXHTRES 28,\nXHTVM 40 and\nXHHCU 45.\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mexico City Arena\nAssociation football is the country's most popular and most televised franchised sport. Its important venues in Mexico City include the Azteca Stadium, home to the Mexico national football team and giants América and Cruz Azul, which can seat 91,653 fans, making it the biggest stadium in Latin America. The Olympic Stadium in Ciudad Universitaria is home to the football club giants Universidad Nacional, with a seating capacity of over 52,000. The Sports City Stadium, which seats 33,042 fans, is near the World Trade Center Mexico City in the Nochebuena neighborhood, and is home to the historical Atlante. América, Cruz Azul and Universidad Nacional are based in Mexico City and play in the First Division; they are also part, with Guadalajara-based giants Club Deportivo Guadalajara, of Mexico's traditional \"Big Four\". The city's three derbies are the \"Clásico Joven\", played between América and Cruz Azul, the capital's two most popular and winningest teams; the \"Clásico Capitalino\", between América and Universidad Nacional, and the \"Clásico Metropolitano\", between Cruz Azul and Universidad Nacional.\n\n\nThe country hosted the FIFA World Cup in 1970 and 1986, and Azteca Stadium is the first stadium in World Cup history to host the final twice. The city will be one of the host cities for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.[201] Mexico City is the first Latin American city to host the Olympic Games, having held the Summer Olympics in 1968, winning bids against Buenos Aires, Lyon and Detroit. The city hosted the 1955 and 1975 Pan American Games, the latter after Santiago and São Paulo withdrew. The ICF Flatwater Racing World Championships were hosted here in 1974 and 1994. Lucha libre is a Mexican style of wrestling, and is one of the more popular sports throughout the country. The main venues in the city are Arena México and Arena Coliseo.\n\n\n\n![](image)Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez\nThe Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez is the main venue for motorsport, and hosts the Formula 1 Mexican Grand Prix since its return to the sport in 2015, the event being held in the past from 1962 to 1970, and again from 1986 to 1992. From 1980 to 1981 and again from 2002 to 2007, the circuit hosted the Champ Car World Series Gran Premio de México. Beginning in 2005, the NASCAR Nationwide Series ran the Telcel-Motorola México 200. 2005 also marked the first running of the Mexico City 250 by the Grand-Am Rolex Sports Car Series. Both races were removed from their series' schedules for 2009.\n\n\nBaseball is another sport played professionally in the city. Mexico City is home of the Mexico City Red Devils of the Mexican League, which is considered a Triple-A league by Major League Baseball. The Devils play their home games at Estadio Alfredo Harp Helú[202] designed by international Mexican-American architect FGP Atelier Founder Francisco Gonzalez Pulido in collaboration with local architect Taller ADG. Mexico City has some 10 Little Leagues for young baseball players. In 2005, Mexico City became the first city to host an NFL regular season game outside of the United States, at the Azteca Stadium. The crowd of 103,467 people attending this game was the largest ever for a regular season game in NFL history until 2009.[203]\n\n\nThe city has also hosted several NBA pre-season games and has hosted international basketball's FIBA Americas Championship, along with north-of-the-border Major League Baseball exhibition games at Foro Sol. In 2017, NBA commissioner Adam Silver expressed interest in placing an NBA G League expansion team in Mexico City as early as 2018. This came to fruition on 12 December 2019 when commissioner Silver announced at a press conference in Mexico City Arena that LNBP team, Capitanes de Ciudad de México will be joining the G League in the 2020–21 season on a five-year agreement.\n\n\nOther sports facilities in Mexico City are the Palacio de los Deportes indoor arena, Francisco Márquez Olympic Swimming Pool, the Hipódromo de Las Américas, the Agustin Melgar Olympic Velodrome, and venues for equestrianism and horse racing, ice hockey, rugby, American-style football, baseball, and basketball. Bullfighting takes place every Sunday during bullfighting season at the 50,000-seat Plaza México, the world's largest bullring. Mexico City's golf courses have hosted Women's LPGA action, and two Men's Golf World Cups. Courses throughout the city are available as private as well as public venues.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nAzteca Stadium\n![](image)\nUniversity Olympic Stadium\n![](image)\nSports City Stadium\n![](image)\nAlfredo Harp Helú Stadium\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Mexico portal\n* ![](image)Mesoamerica portal\n* ![map](image)Latin America portal\n* ![map](image)North America portal\n\n\n* List of pre-columbian archaeological sites in Mexico City\n* List of colonial churches in Mexico City\n* List of colonial non-religious buildings in Mexico City\n* Cuisine of Mexico City\n* Six Flags México\n* Gentrification of Mexico City\n* Greater Mexico City\n* Historic center of Mexico City\n* Barrios Mágicos of Mexico City\n* Mesoamerican Codices\n* Large Cities Climate Leadership Group\n* Largest cities in the Americas\n* Metropolitan areas of Mexico\n* Outline of Mexico\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** In Peninsular Spanish, the spelling variant *Méjico*, is also used alongside *México*.

The population of the city proper is the third largest in the world, with 24.89 million inhabitants in 2021, while the urban area is the most populous in China, with 39.3 million residents. As of 2018, the Greater Shanghai metropolitan area was estimated to produce a gross metropolitan product (nominal) of nearly 9.1 trillion RMB ($1.33 trillion). Shanghai is one of the world's major centers for finance, business and economics, research, science and technology, manufacturing, transportation, tourism, and culture, and the Port of Shanghai is the world's busiest container port.\n\n\nOriginally a fishing village and market town, Shanghai grew in importance in the 19th century due to both domestic and foreign trade and its favorable port location. The city was one of five treaty ports forced to open to European trade after the First Opium War. The Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession were subsequently established. The city then flourished, becoming a primary commercial and financial hub of Asia in the 1930s. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the city was the site of the major Battle of Shanghai. After the war, with the CCP takeover of the mainland in 1949, trade was limited to other socialist countries and the city's global influence declined.\n\n\nBy the 1990s, economic reforms introduced by Deng Xiaoping a decade earlier resulted in an intense redevelopment of the city, especially the Pudong New Area, aiding the return of finance and foreign investment. The city has since re-emerged as a hub for international trade and finance; it is the home of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, one of the largest stock exchanges in the world by market capitalization and the Shanghai Free-Trade Zone, the first free-trade zone in mainland China. Shanghai has been classified as an Alpha+ (global first-tier) city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. As of 2022, it is home to 12 companies of the *Fortune* Global 500 and is ranked 4th on the Global Financial Centres Index. The city is also a global major center for research and development and home to many highly ranked Double First-Class Universities. The Shanghai Metro, first opened in 1993, is the largest metro network in the world by route length. \n\n\nShanghai has been described as the \"showpiece\" of the booming economy of China. Featuring several architectural styles such as Art Deco and shikumen, the city is renowned for its Lujiazui skyline, museums and historic buildings including the City God Temple, Yu Garden, the China Pavilion and buildings along the Bund, which includes Oriental Pearl TV Tower. Shanghai is also known for its sugary cuisine, distinctive local language and vibrant international flair.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Shanghai |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| ![](image)\"Shanghai\" in regular Chinese characters\n |\n| Chinese | 上海 |\n|  |\n| Hanyu Pinyin | Shànghǎi |\n| Wu | Zaon22 he44ⓘ |\n|  |\n| Postal | Shanghai |\n| Literal meaning | \"Upon the Sea\" |\n| \n\n| Transcriptions |\n| --- |\n| Standard Mandarin |\n| Hanyu Pinyin | Shànghǎi |\n| Bopomofo | ㄕㄤˋ   ㄏㄞˇ |\n| Gwoyeu Romatzyh | Shanqhae |\n| Wade–Giles | Shang4-hai3 |\n| IPA | [ʂâŋ.xàɪ] ⓘ |\n| Wu |\n| Romanization | Zaon22 he44ⓘ |\n| ShanghaineseRomanization | Zånhae |\n| Hakka |\n| Romanization | Sông-hói |\n| Yue: Cantonese |\n| Yale Romanization | Seuhnghói |\n| Jyutping | Soeng6hoi2 |\n| IPA | [sœːŋ˨.hɔːi˧˥] |\n| Southern Min |\n| Hokkien POJ | Siōng-hái |\n| Eastern Min |\n| Fuzhou BUC | Siông-hāi |\n\n |\n|  |\n\nThe two Chinese characters in the city's name are 上 (*shàng*/*zan*, \"upon\") and 海 (*hǎi*/*hae*, \"sea\"), together meaning \"On the Sea\". The earliest occurrence of this name dates from the 11th-century Song dynasty, when there was already a river confluence and a town with this name in the area. How the name should be understood has been disputed, but Chinese historians have concluded that during the Tang dynasty, the area of modern-day Shanghai was under sea level, so the land appeared to be literally \"on the sea\".[20]\n\n\nShanghai is officially abbreviated 沪[b] (*Hù*/*Vu*2) in Chinese, a contraction of 沪渎[c] (*Hù Dú*/*Vu Doh*, \"Harpoon Ditch\"), a 4th- or 5th-century Jin name for the mouth of Suzhou Creek when it was the main conduit into the ocean.[23] This character appears on all motor vehicle license plates issued in the municipality today.[24]\n\n\n\n### Alternative names[edit]\n\n\n申 (*Shēn*) or 申城 (*Shēnchéng*, \"Shen City\") was an early name originating from Lord Chunshen, a 3rd-century BC nobleman and prime minister of the state of Chu, whose fief included modern Shanghai.[23] Shanghai-based sports teams and newspapers often use Shen in their names, such as Shanghai Shenhua and *Shen Bao*.\n\n\n华亭[d] (*Huátíng*) was another early name for Shanghai. In AD 751 during the mid-Tang dynasty, Huating County was established by Zhao Juzhen, the governor of Wu Commandery, at modern-day Songjiang, the first county-level administration within modern-day Shanghai. The first five-star hotel in the city was named after Huating.[25]\n\n\n魔都 (*Módū*, \"Magical City\"), a contemporary nickname for Shanghai, is widely known among the youth.[26] The name was first mentioned in Shōfu Muramatsu's 1924 novel *Mato*, which portrayed Shanghai as a dichotomic city where both light and darkness existed.[27]\n\n\nThe city has various nicknames in English, including \"Pearl of the Orient\" and \"Paris of the East\".[28][29] This is similar to Ho Chi Minh City (also known as Saigon), in Vietnam, which has also been nicknamed as \"Paris of the Orient\", due to Vietnam's historical French status.[30]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Shanghai\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Shanghai.\n\n### Antiquity[edit]\n\n\nThe western part of modern-day Shanghai was inhabited 6000 years ago.[31] During the Spring and Autumn period (approximately 771 to 476 BC), it belonged to the Kingdom of Wu, which was conquered by the Kingdom of Yue, which in turn was conquered by the Kingdom of Chu.[32] During the Warring States period (475 BC), Shanghai was part of the fief of Lord Chunshen of Chu, one of the Four Lords of the Warring States. He ordered the excavation of the Huangpu River. Its former or poetic name, the Chunshen River, gave Shanghai its nickname of \"Shēn\".[32] Fishermen living in the Shanghai area then created a fish tool called the *hù*, which lent its name to the outlet of Suzhou Creek north of the Old City and became a common nickname and abbreviation for the city.[33]\n\n\n\n### Imperial era[edit]\n\n\nDuring the Tang and Song dynasties, Qinglong Town (青龙镇[e]) in modern Qingpu District was a major trading port. Established in 746 (the fifth year of the Tang Tianbao era), it developed into what was historically called a \"giant town of the Southeast\", with thirteen temples and seven pagodas. Mi Fu, a scholar and artist of the Song dynasty, served as its mayor. The port experienced thriving trade with provinces along the Yangtze and the Chinese coast, as well as with foreign countries such as Japan and Silla.[2] By the end of the Song dynasty, the center of trading had moved downstream of the Wusong River to Shanghai.[34] It was upgraded in status from a village to a market town in 1074, and in 1172, a second sea wall was built to stabilize the ocean coastline, supplementing an earlier dike.[35] From the Yuan dynasty in 1292 until Shanghai officially became a municipality in 1927, central Shanghai was administered as a county under Songjiang Prefecture, which had its seat in the present-day Songjiang District.[36]\n\n\n\n![](image)Seventeenth century map of the Old City of Shanghai\nTwo important events helped promote Shanghai's developments in the Ming dynasty. A city wall was built for the first time in 1554 to protect the town from raids by Japanese pirates. It measured 10 m (33 ft) high and 5 km (3 mi) in circumference.[37] A City God Temple was built in 1602 during the Wanli reign. This honor was usually reserved for prefectural capitals and not normally given to a mere county seat such as Shanghai. Scholars have theorized that this likely reflected the town's economic importance, as opposed to its low political status.[37]\n\n\nDuring the Qing dynasty, Shanghai became one of the most important sea ports in the Yangtze Delta region as a result of two important central government policy changes: in 1684, the Kangxi Emperor reversed the Ming dynasty prohibition on oceangoing vessels—a ban that had been in force since 1525; and in 1732, the Qianlong Emperor moved the customs office for Jiangsu province (江海关;[f] see Customs House, Shanghai) from the prefectural capital of Songjiang to Shanghai, and gave Shanghai exclusive control over customs collections for Jiangsu's foreign trade. As a result of these two critical decisions, Shanghai became the major trade port for all of the lower Yangtze region by 1735, despite still being at the lowest administrative level in the political hierarchy.[38]\n\n\n\n* ![Songjiang Square Pagoda, built in the 11th century](image)\n\nSongjiang Square Pagoda, built in the 11th century\n* ![The Mahavira Hall at Zhenru Temple, built in 1320](image)\n\nThe Mahavira Hall at Zhenru Temple, built in 1320\n* ![The walled Old City of Shanghai in the 17th century](image)\n\nThe walled Old City of Shanghai in the 17th century\n\n\n### Rise and golden age[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A map of Shanghai in 1884; Chinese area are in yellow, French in red, British in blue, American in orange.\nIn the 19th century, international attention to Shanghai grew due to European recognition of its economic and trade potential at the Yangtze. During the First Opium War (1839–1842), British forces occupied the city.[39] The war ended in 1842 with the Treaty of Nanking, which opened Shanghai as one of the five treaty ports for international trade.[40] The Treaty of the Bogue, the Treaty of Wanghia, and the Treaty of Whampoa (signed in 1843, 1844, and 1844, respectively) forced Chinese concession to European and American desires for visitation and trade on Chinese soil. Britain, France, and the United States all established a presence outside the walled city of Shanghai, which remained under the direct administration of the Chinese.[41]\n\n\nThe Chinese-held Old City of Shanghai fell to rebels from the Small Swords Society in 1853, but was recovered by the Qing government in February 1855.[42] In 1854, the Shanghai Municipal Council was created to manage the foreign settlements. Between 1860 and 1862, the Taiping rebels twice attacked Shanghai and destroyed the city's eastern and southern suburbs, but failed to take the city.[43] In 1863, the British settlement to the south of Suzhou Creek (northern Huangpu District) and the American settlement to the north (southern Hongkou District) joined in order to form the Shanghai International Settlement. The French opted out of the Shanghai Municipal Council and maintained its own concession to the south and southwest.[44]\n\n\n\n![](image)The dismantlement of Old City walls, 1911\nThe First Sino-Japanese War concluded with the 1895 Treaty of Shimonoseki, which elevated Japan to become another foreign power in Shanghai. Japan built the first factories in Shanghai, which was soon copied by other foreign powers. All this international activity gave Shanghai the nickname \"the Great Athens of China\".[45] In 1914, the Old City walls were dismantled because they blocked the city's expansion. In July 1921, the Chinese Communist Party was founded in the French Concession.[41] On 30 May 1925, the May Thirtieth Movement broke out when a worker in a Japanese-owned cotton mill was shot and killed by a Japanese foreman.[46] Workers in the city then launched general strikes against imperialism, which became nationwide protests that gave rise to Chinese nationalism.[47]\n\n\nThe golden age of Shanghai began with its elevation to municipality after it was separated from Jiangsu on 7 July 1927.[41][48] This new Chinese municipality covered an area of 494.69 km2 (191.0 sq mi), including the modern-day districts of Baoshan, Yangpu, Zhabei, Nanshi, and Pudong, but excluded the foreign concessions territories.[48] Headed by a Chinese mayor and municipal council, the new city government's first task—the Greater Shanghai Plan—was to create a new city center in Jiangwan town of Yangpu district, outside the boundaries of the foreign concessions. The plan included a public museum, library, sports stadium, and city hall, which were partially constructed before being interrupted by the Japanese invasion.[49] In the 1920s, *shidaiqu* became a new form of entertainment and was popularised in Shanghai.[50]\n\n\nThe city flourished, becoming a primary commercial and financial hub of the Asia-Pacific region in the 1930s.[51] During the ensuing decades, citizens of many countries and all continents came to Shanghai to live and work; those who stayed for long periods⁠⁠—some for generations⁠—called themselves \"Shanghailanders\".[52] In the 1920s and 1930s, almost 20,000 White Russians fled the newly established Soviet Union to reside in Shanghai.[53] These Shanghai Russians constituted the second-largest foreign community. By 1932, Shanghai had become the world's fifth largest city and home to 70,000 foreigners.[54] In the 1930s, some 30,000 Jewish refugees from Europe arrived in the city.[55]\n\n\n\n* ![Skyline of Shanghai Pudong at night, September 2021](image)\n\nSkyline of Shanghai Pudong at night, September 2021\n* Shanghai, filmed in 1937\n* ![The Bund in the late 1920s seen from the French Concession](image)\n\nThe Bund in the late 1920s seen from the French Concession\n* ![Nanking Road (modern-day East Nanjing Road) in the 1930s](image)\n\nNanking Road (modern-day East Nanjing Road) in the 1930s\n* ![Shanghai Park Hotel was the tallest building in Asia for decades](image)\n\nShanghai Park Hotel was the tallest building in Asia for decades.\n* ![Former Shanghai Library](image)\n\nFormer Shanghai Library\n* ![The HSBC Building, built in 1923, and the Customs House, built in 1927](image)\n\nThe HSBC Building, built in 1923, and the Customs House, built in 1927\n\n\n### Japanese invasion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Zhabei District on fire, 1937\nOn 28 January 1932, Japanese forces invaded Shanghai while the Chinese resisted. More than 10,000 shops and hundreds of factories and public buildings[56] were destroyed, leaving Zhabei district ruined. About 18,000 civilians were either killed, injured, or declared missing.[41] A ceasefire was brokered on 5 May.[57] In 1937, the Battle of Shanghai resulted in the occupation of the Chinese-administered parts of Shanghai outside of the International Settlement and the French Concession. People who stayed in the occupied city suffered on a daily basis, experiencing hunger, oppression, or death.[58] The foreign concessions were ultimately occupied by the Japanese on 8 December 1941 and remained occupied until Japan's surrender in 1945; multiple war crimes were committed during that time.[59]\n\n\nA side-effect of the Japanese invasion of Shanghai was the Shanghai Ghetto. Japanese consul to Kaunas, Lithuania, Chiune Sugihara issued thousands of visas to Jewish refugees who were escaping the Nazi's Final Solution to the Jewish Question. They traveled from Keidan, Lithuania across Russia by railroad to the Vladivostok from where they traveled by ship to Kobe, Japan. Their stay in Kobe was short as the Japanese government transferred them to Shanghai by November 1941. Other Jewish refugees found haven in Shanghai, not through Sugihara, but came on ships from Italy. The refugees from Europe were interned into a cramped ghetto in the Hongkou District, and after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, even the Iraqi Jews who had been living in Shanghai from before the outbreak of WWII were interned. Among the refugees in the Shanghai Ghetto was the Mirrer Yeshiva, including its students and faculty. On 3 September 1945, the Chinese Army liberated the Ghetto and most of the Jews left over the next few years.[60]\n\n\nOn 27 May 1949, the People's Liberation Army took control of Shanghai through the Shanghai Campaign. Under the new People's Republic of China (PRC), Shanghai was one of only three municipalities not merged into neighboring provinces (the others being Beijing and Tianjin).[61] Most foreign firms moved their offices from Shanghai to Hong Kong, as part of a foreign divestment due to the PRC's victory.[62]\n\n\n\n### Modernity[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Nanjing Road, 1967, during the Cultural Revolution\nAfter the war, Shanghai's economy was restored—from 1949 to 1952, the city's agricultural and industrial output increased by 51.5% and 94.2%, respectively.[41] There were 20 urban districts and 10 suburbs at the time.[63] On 17 January 1958, Jiading, Baoshan, and Shanghai County in Jiangsu became part of Shanghai Municipality, which expanded to 863 km2 (333.2 sq mi). The following December, the land area of Shanghai was further expanded to 5,910 km2 (2,281.9 sq mi) after more surrounding suburban areas in Jiangsu were added: Chongming, Jinshan, Qingpu, Fengxian, Chuansha, and Nanhui.[64] In 1964, the city's administrative divisions were rearranged to 10 urban districts and 10 counties.[63]\n\n\nAs the industrial center of China with the most skilled industrial workers, Shanghai became a center for radical leftism during the 1950s and 1960s. The radical leftist Jiang Qing and her three allies, together the Gang of Four, were based in the city.[65] During the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), Shanghai's society was severely damaged. The majority of the workers in the Shanghai branch of the People's Bank of China were Red Guards and they formed a group called the Anti-Economy Liaison Headquarters within the branch.[66]: 38 The Anti-Economy Liaison Headquarters dismantled economic organizations in Shanghai, investigated bank withdrawals, and disrupted regular bank service in the city.[66]: 38The Shanghai People's Commune was established in the city during the January Storm of 1967. Despite the disruptions of the Cultural Revolutions, Shanghai maintained economic production with a positive annual growth rate.[41]\n\n\nDuring the Third Front campaign to develop basic industry and heavy industry in China's hinterlands in case of invasion by the Soviet Union or the United States, 354,900 Shanghainese were sent to work on Third Front projects.[67]: xvi The centerpiece of Shanghai's Small Third Front project was the \"rear base\" in Anhui rear base which served as \"a multi-function manufacturing base for anti-aircraft and anti-tank weaponry.[67]: xvi\n\n\nSince 1949, Shanghai has been a comparatively heavy contributor of tax revenue to the central government; in 1983, the city's contribution in tax revenue was greater than investment received in the past 33 years combined.[68] Its importance to the fiscal well-being of the central government also denied it from economic liberalizations begun in 1978. \n\n\nIn 1990, Deng Xiaoping permitted Shanghai to initiate economic reforms, which reintroduced foreign capital to the city and developed the Pudong district, resulting in the birth of Lujiazui.[69] That year, the China's central government designated Shanghai as the \"Dragon Head\" of economic reform.[70] As of 2020, Shanghai is classified as an Alpha+ city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network, making it one of the world's Top 10 major cities.[71]\n\n\nIn early 2022, Shanghai experienced a large outbreak of COVID-19 cases. After localized lockdowns failed to stem the rise in cases, the Chinese government locked down the entire city on 5 April. This resulted in widespread food shortages across the city emerged as food-supply chains were severely disrupted by the government's lockdown measures, which was not lifted until 1 June.[72]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Shanghai\n\n![](image)The urban area of Shanghai in 2016, along with its major islands. From northwest to southeast: Chongming, Changxing, Hengsha, and the Jiuduansha shoals off Pudong. The Yangtze's natural sediment discharge can be seen.\nShanghai is located on the Yangtze Estuary of China's east coast, with the Yangtze River to the north and Hangzhou Bay to the south, with the East China Sea to the east. The land is formed by the Yangtze's natural deposition and modern land reclamation projects. As such, it has sandy soil, and skyscrapers have to be built with deep concrete piles to avoid sinking into the soft ground.[73] The provincial-level Municipality of Shanghai administers both the estuary and many of its surrounding islands. It borders the provinces of Zhejiang to the south and Jiangsu to the west and north.[74] The municipality's northernmost point is on Chongming Island, which is the second-largest island in mainland China after its expansion during the 20th century.[75] It does not administratively include an exclave of Jiangsu on northern Chongming or the two islands forming Shanghai's Yangshan Port, which are parts of Zhejiang's Shengsi County.\n\n\nShanghai is located on an alluvial plain. As such, the vast majority of its 6,340.5 km2 (2,448.1 sq mi) land area is flat, with an average elevation of 4 m (13 ft).[8] Tidal flat ecosystems exist around the estuary, however, they have long been reclaimed for agricultural purposes.[76] The city's few hills, such as She Shan, lie to the southwest, and its highest point is the peak of Dajinshan Island (103 m or 338 ft) in Hangzhou Bay.[8] Shanghai has many rivers, canals, streams, and lakes, and it is known for its rich water resources as part of the Lake Tai drainage basin.[7]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  Shanghai\n |\n| --- |\n| Climate chart (explanation) |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 49\n\n\n\n8\n\n1\n | 59\n\n\n\n9\n\n2\n | 90\n\n\n\n13\n\n5\n | 97\n\n\n\n19\n\n11\n | 112\n\n\n\n24\n\n16\n | 169\n\n\n\n27\n\n21\n | 151\n\n\n\n32\n\n25\n | 146\n\n\n\n32\n\n25\n | 141\n\n\n\n28\n\n21\n | 57\n\n\n\n23\n\n15\n | 50\n\n\n\n17\n\n9\n | 38\n\n\n\n11\n\n3\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °C |\n| █ Precipitation totals in mm |\n| Source: The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Imperial conversion |\n| --- |\n| J | F | M | A | M | J | J | A | S | O | N | D |\n| 1.9\n\n\n\n46\n\n33\n | 2.3\n\n\n\n48\n\n36\n | 3.6\n\n\n\n55\n\n42\n | 3.8\n\n\n\n66\n\n51\n | 4.4\n\n\n\n75\n\n61\n | 6.6\n\n\n\n81\n\n69\n | 6\n\n\n\n90\n\n77\n | 5.8\n\n\n\n89\n\n77\n | 5.6\n\n\n\n82\n\n69\n | 2.3\n\n\n\n73\n\n59\n | 2\n\n\n\n63\n\n48\n | 1.5\n\n\n\n52\n\n37\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °F |\n| █ Precipitation totals in inches |\n\n |\n\n\nDowntown Shanghai is bisected by the Huangpu River, a man-made tributary of the Yangtze created by order of Lord Chunshen during the Warring States period.[32] The historic center of the city was located on the west bank of the Huangpu (Puxi), near the mouth of Suzhou Creek, connecting it with Lake Tai and the Grand Canal. The central financial district, Lujiazui, has been established on the east bank of the Huangpu (Pudong). Along Shanghai's eastern shore, the destruction of local wetlands due to the construction of Pudong International Airport has been partially offset by the protection and expansion of a nearby shoal, Jiuduansha, as a nature preserve.[77]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nShanghai has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa), with an average annual temperature of 15.8 °C (60.4 °F) for urban districts and 15.2–15.7 °C (59.4–60.3 °F) for suburbs.[73] The city experiences four distinct seasons. Winters are temperate to cold and damp—northwesterly winds from Siberia can cause nighttime temperatures to drop below freezing. Each year, there are an average of 6.2 days with snowfall and 2.8 days with snow cover.[73] Summers are hot and humid, and occasional downpours or freak thunderstorms can be expected. On average, 8.7 days exceed 35 °C (95 °F) annually. In summer and the beginning of autumn, the city is susceptible to typhoons.[78]\n\n\nThe most pleasant seasons are generally spring, although changeable and often rainy, and autumn, which is usually sunny and dry. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 28% in June to 47% in August, the city receives 1,763 hours of bright sunshine annually. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from −10.1 °C (14 °F) on 31 January 1977 (unofficial record of −12.1 °C (10 °F) was set on 19 January 1893) to 40.9 °C (106 °F) on 13 July 2022 at a weather station in Xujiahui.\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Shanghai (Minhang District), 1991–2020 normals, extremes 1951–present\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 22.1(71.8)\n | 27.0(80.6)\n | 29.6(85.3)\n | 34.3(93.7)\n | 36.4(97.5)\n | 37.5(99.5)\n | 40.9(105.6)\n | 39.9(103.8)\n | 38.2(100.8)\n | 36.0(96.8)\n | 28.7(83.7)\n | 24.0(75.2)\n | 40.9(105.6)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 8.7(47.7)\n | 10.7(51.3)\n | 14.8(58.6)\n | 20.6(69.1)\n | 25.5(77.9)\n | 28.3(82.9)\n | 32.8(91.0)\n | 32.3(90.1)\n | 28.5(83.3)\n | 23.6(74.5)\n | 17.9(64.2)\n | 11.5(52.7)\n | 21.3(70.3)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 4.9(40.8)\n | 6.6(43.9)\n | 10.4(50.7)\n | 15.8(60.4)\n | 20.9(69.6)\n | 24.4(75.9)\n | 28.8(83.8)\n | 28.5(83.3)\n | 24.7(76.5)\n | 19.5(67.1)\n | 13.7(56.7)\n | 7.3(45.1)\n | 17.1(62.8)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 1.9(35.4)\n | 3.3(37.9)\n | 6.8(44.2)\n | 11.9(53.4)\n | 17.2(63.0)\n | 21.5(70.7)\n | 25.8(78.4)\n | 25.7(78.3)\n | 21.6(70.9)\n | 15.9(60.6)\n | 10.1(50.2)\n | 3.9(39.0)\n | 13.8(56.8)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −10.1(13.8)\n | −7.9(17.8)\n | −5.4(22.3)\n | −0.5(31.1)\n | 6.9(44.4)\n | 12.3(54.1)\n | 16.3(61.3)\n | 18.8(65.8)\n | 10.8(51.4)\n | 1.7(35.1)\n | −4.2(24.4)\n | −8.5(16.7)\n | −10.1(13.8)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 70.4(2.77)\n | 65.4(2.57)\n | 95.4(3.76)\n | 82.5(3.25)\n | 93.2(3.67)\n | 207.3(8.16)\n | 148.0(5.83)\n | 187.1(7.37)\n | 118.1(4.65)\n | 68.4(2.69)\n | 59.4(2.34)\n | 50.3(1.98)\n | 1,245.5(49.04)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.1 mm) | 10.9\n | 10.2\n | 12.9\n | 11.3\n | 11.2\n | 14.5\n | 11.7\n | 12.4\n | 9.8\n | 7.4\n | 9.1\n | 8.3\n | 129.7\n |\n| Average snowy days\n | 1.8\n | 1.4\n | 0.4\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0.1\n | 0.7\n | 4.4\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 74\n | 73\n | 72\n | 71\n | 73\n | 80\n | 78\n | 78\n | 76\n | 73\n | 74\n | 72\n | 75\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 114.8\n | 117.9\n | 143.8\n | 168.1\n | 176.8\n | 131.2\n | 209.4\n | 202.3\n | 163.7\n | 162.1\n | 131.1\n | 129.7\n | 1,850.9\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 36\n | 37\n | 39\n | 43\n | 41\n | 31\n | 49\n | 50\n | 45\n | 46\n | 42\n | 41\n | 42\n |\n| Source: China Meteorological Administration[79][80] |\n\n## Cityscape[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nView of Lujiazui from The Bund during the day\n\n![](image)\nView of Pudong from Waibaidu Bridge\n\n![](image)\nNight view of Lujiazui in Pudong.\n\nThe Bund, located by the bank of the Huangpu River, is home to a row of early 20th-century architecture, ranging in style from the neoclassical HSBC Building to the Art Deco Sassoon House (now part of the Peace Hotel). Many areas in the former foreign concessions are also well-preserved, the most notable being the French Concession.[81] Shanghai is also home to many architecturally distinctive and even eccentric buildings, including the Shanghai Museum, the Shanghai Grand Theatre, the Shanghai Oriental Art Center, and the Oriental Pearl Tower. Despite rampant redevelopment, the Old City still retains some traditional architecture and designs, such as the Yu Garden, an elaborate Jiangnan style garden.[82]\n\n\nAs a result of its construction boom during the 1920s and 1930s, Shanghai has among the most Art Deco buildings in the world.[81] One of the most famous architects working in Shanghai was László Hudec, a Hungarian-Slovak who lived in the city between 1918 and 1947.[83] His most notable Art Deco buildings include the Park Hotel, the Grand Cinema, and the Paramount.[84] Other prominent architects who contributed to the Art Deco style are Clement Palmer and Arthur Turner, who together designed the Peace Hotel, the Metropole Hotel, and the Broadway Mansions;[85] and Austrian architect C.H. Gonda, who designed the Capitol Theatre. The Bund has been revitalized several times. The first was in 1986, with a new promenade by the Dutch architect Paulus Snoeren.[86] The second was before the 2010 Expo, which includes restoration of the century-old Waibaidu Bridge and reconfiguration of traffic flow.[87]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Bund\nOne distinctive cultural element is the shikumen (石库门, \"stone storage door\") residence, typically two- or three-story gray brick houses with the front yard protected by a heavy wooden door in a stylistic stone arch.[88] Each residence is connected and arranged in straight alleys, known as longtang[g] (弄堂). The house is similar to western-style terrace houses or townhouses, but distinguished by the tall, heavy brick wall and archway in front of each house.[90]\n\n\nThe shikumen is a cultural blend of elements found in Western architecture with traditional Jiangnan Chinese architecture and social behavior.[88] Like almost all traditional Chinese dwellings, it has a courtyard, which reduces outside noise. Vegetation can be grown in the courtyard, and it can also allow for sunlight and ventilation to the rooms.[91]\n\n\n\n![](image)Shanghai World Financial Center (left) and Jin Mao Tower (right)\nSome of Shanghai's buildings feature Soviet neoclassical architecture or Stalinist architecture, though the city has fewer such structures than Beijing. These buildings were mostly erected between the founding of the People's Republic in 1949 and the Sino-Soviet Split in the late 1960s. During this time period, large numbers of Soviet experts, including architects, poured into China to aid the country in the construction of a communist state. An example of Soviet neoclassical architecture in Shanghai is the modern-day Shanghai Exhibition Center.[92]\n\n\nShanghai—Lujiazui in particular—has numerous skyscrapers, making it the fifth city in the world with the most skyscrapers.[93] Among the most prominent examples are the 421 m (1,381 ft) high Jin Mao Tower, the 492 m (1,614 ft) high Shanghai World Financial Center, and the 632 m (2,073 ft) high Shanghai Tower, which is the tallest building in China and the third tallest in the world.[94] Completed in 2015, the tower takes the form of nine twisted sections stacked atop each other, totaling 128 floors.[95] It is featured in its double-skin facade design, which eliminates the need for either layer to be opaqued for reflectivity as the double-layer structure has already reduced the heat absorption.[96] The futuristic-looking Oriental Pearl Tower, at 468 m (1,535 ft), is located nearby at the northern tip of Lujiazui.[97] Skyscrapers outside of Lujiazui include the White Magnolia Plaza in Hongkou, the Shimao International Plaza in Huangpu, and the Shanghai Wheelock Square in Jing'an.\n\n\n\n* ![The Shanghai Museum](image)\n\nThe Shanghai Museum\n* ![The Shanghai Grand Theater](image)\n\nThe Shanghai Grand Theater\n* ![The Shanghai Exhibition Center, an example of Stalinist architecture](image)\n\nThe Shanghai Exhibition Center, an example of Stalinist architecture\n* ![The Oriental Pearl Tower at night](image)\n\nThe Oriental Pearl Tower at night\n* ![Shanghai Tower](image)\n\nShanghai Tower\n* ![Glass facades of two skyscrapers](image)\n\nGlass facades of two skyscrapers\n\n\n## Politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Politics of Shanghai and Shanghai Municipal People's Government\n\n### Structure[edit]\n\n\n\n\nCurrent leaders of the Shanghai Municipal Government\n|  | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Title\n | **CCP Committee Secretary** | **SMPC Chairman** | **Mayor** | **Shanghai CPPCC Chairman** |\n| Name\n | Chen Jining | Jiang Zhuoqing | Gong Zheng | Dong Yunhu\n |\n| Ancestral home | Lishu, Jilin | Cixi, Zhejiang | Suzhou, Jiangsu | Taizhou, Zhejiang |\n| Born\n | February 1964 (age 60) | August 1959 (age 64) | March 1960 (age 64) | November 1962 (age 61)\n |\n| Assumed office\n | October 2022[98] | January 2020[99] | March 2020[100] | January 2018[101] |\n\n\n![](image)Shanghai Municipal Government building\nLike all governing institutions in mainland China, Shanghai has a parallel party-government system,[102] in which the CCP Committee Secretary, officially termed the Chinese Communist Party Shanghai Municipal Committee Secretary, outranks the Mayor.[103] The CCP committee acts as the top policy-formulation body, and is typically composed of 12 members (including the secretary), and has control over the Shanghai Municipal People's Government.[104][105]\n\n\nPolitical power in Shanghai has frequently been a stepping stone to higher positions in the central government. Since Jiang Zemin became the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party in June 1989, all former Shanghai party secretaries but one were elevated to the Politburo Standing Committee, the *de facto* highest decision-making body in China,[102] including Jiang himself (Party General Secretary),[106] Zhu Rongji (Premier),[107] Wu Bangguo (NPC Chairman),[108] Huang Ju (Vice Premier),[109] Xi Jinping (current General Secretary),[110] Yu Zhengsheng (CPPCC Chairman),[111] Han Zheng (Vice Premier and Vice President),[112] and Li Qiang (Premier). Zeng Qinghong, a former deputy party secretary of Shanghai, also rose to the Politburo Standing Committee and became the Vice President and an influential power broker.[113] The only exception is Chen Liangyu, who was fired in 2006 and later convicted of corruption.[114]\n\n\nOfficials with ties to the Shanghai administration collectively form a powerful faction in the central government known as the Shanghai Clique, which has often been viewed to compete against the rival Youth League Faction over personnel appointments and policy decisions.[115] However, Xi Jinping, successor to Hu Jintao as General Secretary and President, was largely an independent leader and took anti-corruption campaigns on both factions.[116]\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of administrative divisions of Shanghai and List of township-level divisions of Shanghai\n\nShanghai is one of the four municipalities under the direct administration of the Government of the People's Republic of China,[117] and is divided into 16 county-level districts.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Administrative divisions of Shanghai\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)\n**Huangpu**\n\n**Xuhui**\n\n**Changning**\n\n**Jing'an**\n\n**Putuo**\n\n**Hongkou**\n\n**Yangpu**\n\n**Minhang**\n\n**Baoshan**\n\n**Jiading**\n\n**Pudong**\n\n**Jinshan**\n\n**Songjiang**\n\n**Qingpu**\n\n**Fengxian**\n\n**Chongming**\n |\n| Division code[118] | Division\n | Area (km2)[119] | Total population 2020[119] | Seat\n | Postal code\n |\n| 310000 | Shanghai\n | 6,340.50 | 24,870,895 | Huangpu | 200000\n |\n| 310101 | Huangpu | 20.46 | 662,030 | Waitan Subdistrict | 200001\n |\n| 310104 | Xuhui | 54.76 | 1,113,078 | Xujiahui Subdistrict | 200030\n |\n| 310105 | Changning | 38.30 | 693,051 | Jiangsu Road Subdistrict | 200050\n |\n| 310106 | Jing'an | 36.88 | 975,707 | Jiangning Road Subdistrict | 200040\n |\n| 310107 | Putuo | 54.83 | 1,239,800 | Zhenru Town Subdistrict | 200333\n |\n| 310109 | Hongkou | 23.46 | 757,498 | Jiaxing Road Subdistrict | 200080\n |\n| 310110 | Yangpu | 60.73 | 1,242,548 | Pingliang Road Subdistrict | 200082\n |\n| 310112 | Minhang | 370.75 | 2,653,489 | Xinzhuang town | 201100\n |\n| 310113 | Baoshan | 270.99 | 2,235,218 | Youyi Road Subdistrict | 201900\n |\n| 310114 | Jiading | 464.20 | 1,834,258 | Xincheng Road Subdistrict | 201800\n |\n| 310115 | Pudong | 1,210.41 | 5,681,512 | Huamu Subdistrict | 200135\n |\n| 310116 | Jinshan | 586.05 | 822,776 | Shanyang town | 201500\n |\n| 310117 | Songjiang | 605.64 | 1,909,713 | Fangsong Subdistrict | 201600\n |\n| 310118 | Qingpu | 670.14 | 1,271,424 | Xiayang Subdistrict | 201700\n |\n| 310120 | Fengxian | 687.39 | 1,140,872 | Nanqiao town | 201400\n |\n| 310151 | Chongming | 1,185.49 | 637,921 | Chengqiao town | 202100\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Divisions in Chinese and varieties of romanizations\n |\n| --- |\n| English\n | Chinese\n | Pinyin\n | Shanghainese Romanization\n |\n| Shanghai Municipality\n | 上海市 | Shànghǎi Shì\n | zaon he zy\n |\n| Huangpu District | 黄浦区 | Huángpǔ Qū\n | waon phu chiu\n |\n| Xuhui District | 徐汇区 | Xúhuì Qū\n | zi we chiu\n |\n| Changning District | 长宁区 | Chángníng Qū\n | zan nyin chiu\n |\n| Jing'an District | 静安区 | Jìng'ān Qū\n | zin oe chiu\n |\n| Putuo District | 普陀区 | Pǔtuó Qū\n | phu du chiu\n |\n| Hongkou District | 虹口区 | Hóngkǒu Qū\n | ghon kheu chiu\n |\n| Yangpu District | 杨浦区 | Yángpǔ Qū\n | yan phu chiu\n |\n| Minhang District | 闵行区 | Mǐnháng Qū\n | min ghaon chiu\n |\n| Baoshan District | 宝山区 | Bǎoshān Qū\n | pau sae chiu\n |\n| Jiading District | 嘉定区 | Jiādìng Qū\n | ka din chiu\n |\n| Pudong New Area | 浦东新区 | Pǔdōng Xīnqū\n | phu ton sin chiu\n |\n| Jinshan District | 金山区 | Jīnshān Qū\n | cin se chiu\n |\n| Songjiang District | 松江区 | Sōngjiāng Qū\n | son kaon chiu\n |\n| Qingpu District | 青浦区 | Qīngpǔ Qū\n | tsin phu chiu\n |\n| Fengxian District | 奉贤区 | Fèngxián Qū\n | von yi chiu\n |\n| Chongming District | 崇明区 | Chóngmíng Qū\n | dzon min chiu\n |\n\n\nAlthough every district has its own urban core, the city hall and major administrative units are located in Huangpu District, which also serves as a commercial area, including the famous Nanjing Road.

As of 2021, the city was ranked as the 2nd Fintech powerhouse in the world after New York City.[151]\n\n\nAs of 2019[update], the Shanghai Stock Exchange had a market capitalization of US$4.02 trillion, making it the largest stock exchange in China and the fourth-largest stock exchange in the world.[152] In 2009, the trading volume of six key commodities—including rubber, copper, and zinc—on the Shanghai Futures Exchange all ranked first globally.[153] By the end of 2017, Shanghai had 1,491 financial institutions, of which 251 were foreign-invested.[154]\n\n\nIn September 2013 with the backing of Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, the city launched the China (Shanghai) Pilot Free-Trade Zone—the first free-trade zone in mainland China. The zone introduced a number of pilot reforms designed to incentivize foreign investment. In April 2014, *The Banker* reported that Shanghai \"has attracted the highest volumes of financial sector foreign direct investment in the Asia-Pacific region in the 12 months to the end of January 2014\".[155] In August 2014, *fDi magazine* named Shanghai the \"Chinese Province of the Future 2014/15\" due to \"particularly impressive performances in the Business Friendliness and Connectivity categories, as well as placing second in the Economic Potential and Human Capital and Lifestyle categories\".[156]\n\n\n\n### Manufacturing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The F-22P frigate built by Hudong-Zhonghua for the Pakistan Navy\nAs one of the main industrial centers of China, Shanghai plays a key role in domestic manufacturing and heavy industry. Several industrial zones—including Shanghai Hongqiao Economic and Technological Development Zone, Jinqiao Export Economic Processing Zone, Minhang Economic and Technological Development Zone, and Shanghai Caohejing High-Tech Development Zone—are backbones of Shanghai's secondary sector. Shanghai is home to China's largest steelmaker Baosteel Group, China's largest shipbuilding base Hudong-Zhonghua Shipbuilding Group, and one of China's oldest shipbuilders, the Jiangnan Shipyard.[157][158] Auto manufacturing is another important industry. The Shanghai-based SAIC Motor is one of the three largest automotive corporations in China, and has strategic partnerships with Volkswagen and General Motors.[159]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of tourist attractions in Shanghai.\n\n![The Nanjing Pedestrian Street at night. This is a popular commercial center in Shanghai.](image)Nanjing Road near The Bund at night. This is a popular commercial center in Shanghai.\nTourism is a major industry of Shanghai. In 2017, the number of domestic tourists increased by 7.5% to 318 million, while the number of overseas tourists increased by 2.2% to 8.73 million.[154] In 2017, Shanghai was the highest earning tourist city in the world, which is expected to maintain until 2027.[160] As of 2019, Shanghai had 71 five-star hotels, 61 four star hotels, 1,758 travel agencies, 113 rated tourist attractions, and 34 red tourist attractions.[142]\n\n\nThe conference and meeting sector is also growing. According to the International Congress and Convention Association, Shanghai hosted 82 international meetings in 2018, a 34% increase from 61 in 2017.[161][162]\n\n\n\n### Free-trade zone[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Shanghai Free-Trade Zone\n\nShanghai is home to China (Shanghai) Pilot Free-Trade Zone, the first free-trade zone in mainland China.[163] As of October 2019[update], it is also the second largest free-trade zone in mainland China in terms of land area (behind Hainan Free Trade Zone [zh], which covers the whole Hainan province[164]) by covering an area of 240.22 km2 (92.75 sq mi) and integrating four existing bonded zones—Waigaoqiao Free Trade Zone, Waigaoqiao Free Trade Logistics Park, Yangshan Free Trade Port Area, and Pudong Airport Comprehensive Free Trade Zone.[165][166] The industrial chain of port logistics has shaped the future development direction of the free-trade zone in Shanghai. Currently, two port chain centers have been approved for construction in Waigaoqiao and Yangshan.[167] Several preferential policies have been implemented to attract foreign investment in various industries to the zone. Because the zone is not technically considered Chinese territory for tax purposes, commodities entering the zone are exempt from duty and customs clearance.[168]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Shanghai\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% p.a. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1954[169] | 6,204,400 | —     |\n| 1964[169] | 10,816,500 | +5.72% |\n| 1982[169] | 11,859,700 | +0.51% |\n| 1990[169] | 13,341,900 | +1.48% |\n| 2000[169] | 16,407,700 | +2.09% |\n| 2010[169] | 23,019,200 | +3.44% |\n| 2015[170] | 24,152,700 | +0.97% |\n| 2016[170] | 24,197,000 | +0.18% |\n| 2017[170] | 24,183,300 | −0.06% |\n| 2018[141] | 24,237,800 | +0.23% |\n| 2019[142] | 24,281,400 | +0.18% |\n| Population size may be affected by changes to administrative divisions. |\n\n\nAs of 2022[update], Shanghai had a total population of 24,758,900, including 14,693,630 (59.3%) hukou holders (registered locally).[142] As of 2021[update], 89.3% of Shanghai's population live in urban areas, and 10.7% live in rural areas.[11] Based on the population of its total administrative area, Shanghai is the second largest of the four municipalities of China, behind Chongqing, but is generally considered the largest Chinese city because the urban population of Chongqing is much smaller.[171] According to the OECD, Shanghai's metropolitan area has an estimated population of 34 million.[172]\n\n\nAccording to the Shanghai Municipal Statistics Bureau, about 157,900 residents in Shanghai are foreigners, including 28,900 Japanese, 21,900 Americans and 20,800 Koreans.[173] The actual number of foreign citizens in the city is probably much higher.[174] Shanghai is also a domestic immigration city—40.3% (9.8 million) of the city's residents are from other regions of China.[142]\n\n\nShanghai has a life expectancy of 83.18 years for the city's registered population,[175] the highest life expectancy of all cities in mainland China. This has also caused the city to experience population aging—in 2021, 17.4% (4.3 million) of the city's registered population was aged 65 or above.[142] In 2017, the Chinese government implemented population controls for Shanghai, resulting in a population decline of 10,000 people by the end of the year.[176]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article on Chinese Wikipedia: 上海宗教\n\nSee also: Religion in China\n\n![](image)Bird's-eye view of the golden pagoda of Jing'an Temple\nDue to its cosmopolitan history, Shanghai has a blend of religious heritage; religious buildings and institutions are scattered around the city. According to a 2012 survey, only 13.1% of the city's population belongs to organized religions, including Buddhists with 10.4%, Protestants with 1.9%, Catholics with 0.7%, and other faiths with 0.1% while the remaining 86.9% of the population could be either atheists or involved in worship of nature deities and ancestors or folk religious sects.[177]\n\n\n\n<div style=\"border:solid transparent;background-color:initial;position:absolute;width:100px;line-height:0;<div style=\"border:solid transparent;background-color:initial;position:absolute;width:100px;line-height:0;\n\nReligion in Shanghai (2012):\n\n\n\nChinese folk religion, or atheist (86.9%)\nBuddhism (10.4%)\nProtestantism (1.9%)\nCatholicism (0.7%)\nOther (0.1%)\n\nBuddhism, in its Chinese varieties, has had a presence in Shanghai since the Three Kingdoms period, during which the Longhua Temple—the largest temple in Shanghai—and the Jing'an Temple were founded.[178] Another significant temple is the Jade Buddha Temple, which was named after a large statue of Buddha carved out of jade in the temple.[179] As of 2014[update], Buddhism in Shanghai had 114 temples, 1,182 clergical staff, and 453,300 registered followers.[178] The religion also has its own college, the Shanghai Buddhist College [zh], and its own press, Shanghai Buddhological Press [zh].[180]\n\n\n\n![](image)The St. Ignatius Cathedral\nCatholicism was brought into Shanghai in 1608 by Italian missionary Lazzaro Cattaneo.[181] The Apostolic Vicariate of Shanghai was erected in 1933, and was further elevated to the Diocese of Shanghai in 1946.[182] Notable Catholic sites include the St. Ignatius Cathedral in Xujiahui—the largest Catholic church in the city,[183] the St. Francis Xavier Church, and the She Shan Basilica.[184] Other forms of Christianity in Shanghai include Eastern Orthodox minorities and, since 1996, registered Christian Protestant churches.\n\n\nAlthough currently making up a fraction of the religious population in Shanghai, Jewish people have played an influential role in the city's history. After the Treaty of Nanking ended the First Opium War in 1842, the city was opened up to western populations and merchants traveled to Shanghai for its rich business potential, including many prominent Jewish families. The Sassoons amassed great wealth in the opium and textile trades, cementing their status by funding many of the buildings that have become iconic in Shanghai's skyline, such as the Cathay Hotel in 1929.[185] The Hardoons were another prominent Baghdadi Jewish family that used their business success to define Shanghai in the 20th century. The head of the family, Silas Hardoon, one of the richest people in the world during the 1800s, financed Nanjing Road, which then housed departmental stores in the International Settlement, that is now one of the busiest shopping centers in the world.[185]\n\n\nDuring World War II, thousands of Jews emigrated to Shanghai in an effort to flee Nazi Germany. They lived in a designated area called the Shanghai Ghetto and formed a community centered on the Ohel Moishe Synagogue, which is now the Shanghai Jewish Refugees Museum.[186] In 1939, Horace Kadoorie, the head of the powerful philanthropic Sephardic Jewish family in Shanghai, founded the Shanghai Jewish Youth Association to support Jewish refugees through English education so they would be prepared to emigrate from Shanghai when the time came.[187]\n\n\nIslam came into Shanghai during the Yuan dynasty. The city's first mosque, Songjiang Mosque, was built during the Zhizheng (至正) era under Emperor Huizong (reigned 1333 – 1368). Shanghai's Muslim population increased in the 19th and early 20th centuries (when the city was a treaty port), during which time many mosques—including the Xiaotaoyuan Mosque, the Huxi Mosque, and the Pudong Mosque—were built. The Shanghai Islamic Association is located in the Xiaotaoyuan Mosque in Huangpu.[188]\n\n\nShanghai has several folk religious temples, including the City God Temple at the heart of the Old City, the Dajing Ge Pavilion dedicated to the Three Kingdoms general Guan Yu, the Confucian Temple of Shanghai, and a major Taoist center Shanghai White Cloud Temple [zh] where the Shanghai Taoist Association locates.[189]\n\n\n\n### Language[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Shanghainese\n\n| Ability to speak the following dialects/languages in Shanghai (2013)[190] |\n| --- |\n| Languages |  | % | Can Speak |\n| Mandarin |  | 97.0% |\n| Shanghainese |  | 81.4% |\n| English |  | 47.5% |\n| Other Chinese |  | 29.7% |\n| Other foreign languages |  | 7.8% |\n| Sampled among residents ≥ 13 years old. |\n\nThe vernacular language spoken in the city is Shanghainese, part of the Taihu Wu subgroup of the Wu Chinese language family. This is different from the national language, Mandarin, which is mutually unintelligible with Wu Chinese.[191] Modern Shanghainese derives from the indigenous Wu spoken in the former Songjiang prefecture but has been influenced by other dialects of Taihu Wu, most notably Suzhounese, and Ningbonese[192]\n\n\nPrior to its expansion, the language spoken in Shanghai was not as prominent as those spoken around Jiaxing and later Suzhou,[192] and was known as \"the local tongue\" (本地閑話), a name which is now used in suburbs only.[193] In the late 19th century, downtown Shanghainese (市區閑話 or simply 上海閑話) appeared, undergoing rapid changes and quickly replacing Suzhounese as the prestige dialect of the Yangtze River Delta region. At the time, most of the immigration into the city came from the two adjacent provinces, Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the local dialects of which had the greatest influence on Shanghainese. After 1949, Putonghua (Standard Mandarin) has also had a great impact on Shanghainese as a result of being rigorously promoted by the government.[192] Since the 1990s, many migrants outside of the Wu-speaking region have come to Shanghai for education and jobs. They often cannot speak the local language and therefore use Putonghua (Mandarin) as a lingua franca. Because Putonghua and English were more favored, Shanghainese began to decline, and fluency among young speakers weakened. In recent years, there have been movements within the city to promote the local language and protect it from fading out.[194][195]\n\n\n\n## Education and research[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Shanghai\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of universities and colleges in Shanghai.\n\n![](image)Shanghai Jiao Tong University Library\nShanghai is an international center of research and development and as of 2022, it was ranked third globally and second in the whole Asia & Oceania region (after Beijing) by scientific research outputs, as tracked by the Nature Index.[196] It is also a major center of higher education in China. As of 2022, Shanghai had 64 universities and colleges, ranking first in East China region as a city with most higher education institutions.[197]\n\n\nShanghai has many highly ranked educational institutions,[198][199] with 15 universities listed in 147 Double First-Class Universities ranking second nationwide among all cities in China (after Beijing). A number of China's most prestigious universities appearing in the global university rankings are based in Shanghai, including Fudan University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Tongji University, East China Normal University, Shanghai University, East China University of Science and Technology, Donghua University, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai International Studies University, University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, Shanghai University of Electric Power, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai Maritime University, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai Ocean University, Shanghai University of Engineering Science, Shanghai Institute of Technology, Shanghai Conservatory of Music, and Shanghai University of Sport.[199][200][201][202] Some of these universities were selected as \"985 universities\" or \"211 universities\" since the 90s by the Chinese government in order to build world-class universities.[203][204]\n\n\n\n![](image)Fudan University\nShanghai is a seat of two members (Fudan University and Shanghai Jiao Tong University) of the C9 League, an alliance of elite Chinese universities offering comprehensive and leading education,[205] and these two universities are ranked consistently in the Asia top 10, [206][207] and in the global top 100 research comprehensive universities according to the most influential university rankings in the world such as QS Rankings, Shanghai Rankings, Times Higher Education Rankings and *U.S. News & World Report* Best Global Universities Ranking.[201][208][209][199] Fudan University established a joint EMBA program with Washington University in St. Louis in 2002 which has since consistently been ranked as one of the best in the world.[210][211]\n\n\nThe other two members of the \"Project 985\", Tongji University and East China Normal University, are also based in Shanghai and internationally; they are regarded as one of the most reputable Chinese universities by the *Times Higher Education World Reputation Rankings* where they ranked 150–175th globally.[212] The city is also home to the Shanghai University of Sport, which consistently ranks the best in China among universities specialized in sports.[213] As of 2022, Shanghai University of Sport ranks #1 in Asia and #43 globally according to the \"Global Ranking of Sport Science Schools and Departments 2022\" released by Shanghai Ranking.[214]\n\n\nThe city has many Chinese–foreign joint education institutes [zh], such as the Shanghai University–University of Technology Sydney Business School since 1994, the University of Michigan–Shanghai Jiao Tong University Joint Institute since 2006, and New York University Shanghai—the first China–U.S. joint venture university—since 2012.[215][216] In 2013, the Shanghai Municipality and the Chinese Academy of Sciences founded the ShanghaiTech University in the Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Park in Pudong.[217] Shanghai is also home to the cadre school China Executive Leadership Academy in Pudong and the China Europe International Business School. The city government's education agency is the Shanghai Municipal Education Commission.\n\n\nThe city is also a seat of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, China's oldest think tank for the humanities and social sciences. It is the largest one outside the capital of Beijing after the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS).[218]\n\n\nBy the end of 2019, the city also had 929 secondary schools, 698 primary schools, and 31 special schools.[142] In Shanghai, the nine years of compulsory education—including five years of primary education and four years of junior secondary education—are free, with a gross enrollment ratio of over 99.9%.[142] The city's compulsory education system is among the best in the world: in 2009 and 2012, 15-year-old students from Shanghai ranked first in every subject (math, reading, and science) in the Program for International Student Assessment, a worldwide study of academic performance conducted by the OECD.[219][220] The consecutive three-year senior secondary education is priced and uses the Senior High School Entrance Examination (*Zhongkao*) as a selection process, with a gross enrollment ratio of 98%.[221] Among all senior high schools, the four with the best teaching quality—Shanghai High School, No. 2 High School Attached to East China Normal University, High School Affiliated to Fudan University, and High School Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University—are termed \"The Four Schools\" (“四校”) of Shanghai.[222] As of October 2019[update], the city's National College Entrance Examination (*Gaokao*) is structured under the \"3+3\" system, in which all general senior high school students study three compulsory subjects (Chinese, English, and math) and three subjects chosen from six options (physics, chemistry, biology, history, geography, and politics).[223]\n\n\n\n## Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Shanghai\n\n### Public[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Shanghai Metro is the longest metro system in the world.\n![](image)Shanghai Metro Network\nShanghai has an extensive public transportation system comprising metros, buses, ferries, and taxis, all of which can be accessed using a Shanghai Public Transport Card.[224]\n\n\nShanghai's rapid transit system, the Shanghai Metro, incorporates both subway and light metro lines and extends to every core urban district as well as neighboring suburban districts. As of 2021[update], there are 19 metro lines (excluding the Shanghai maglev train and Jinshan Railway), 515 stations, and 803 km (499 mi) of lines in operation, making it the longest network in the world.[142] On 8 March 2019, it set the city's daily metro ridership record with 13.3 million.[225] The average fare ranges from CN¥3 (US$0.48) to CN¥9 (US$1.28), depending on the travel distance.[226]\n\n\n\n![](image)A maglev train leaving Pudong International Airport\nOpened in 2004, the Shanghai maglev train is the first and the fastest commercial high-speed maglev in the world, with a maximum operation speed of 430 km/h (267 mph).[227] The train can complete the 30-kilometer (19 mi) journey between Longyang Road Station and Pudong International Airport in 7 minutes 20 seconds,[228] comparing to 32 minutes by Metro Line 2[229] and 30 minutes by car.[230] A one-way ticket costs CN¥50 (US$8), or CN¥40 (US$6.40) for those with airline tickets or public transportation cards. A round-trip ticket costs CN¥80 (US$12.80), and VIP tickets cost double the standard fare.[231]\n\n\nWith the first tram line been in service in 1908, trams were once popular in Shanghai in the early 20th century. By 1925, there were 328 tramcars and 14 routes operated by Chinese, French, and British companies collaboratively,[232] all of which were nationalized after the PRC's victory in 1949. Since the 1960s, many tram lines were either dismantled or replaced by trolleybus or motorbus lines;[233] the last tram line was demolished in 1975.[234] Shanghai reintroduced trams in 2010, as a modern rubber-tire Translohr system in Zhangjiang area of East Shanghai as Zhangjiang Tram.[235] In 2018, the steel wheeled Songjiang Tram started operating in Songjiang District.[236] Additional tram lines are under planning in Hongqiao Subdistrict and Jiading District as of 2019[update].[237]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Shanghai Trolleybus network is currently the oldest in the world.\nShanghai also has the world's most extensive bus network, including the world's oldest continuously operating trolleybus system, with 1,575 lines covering a total length of 8,997 km (5,590 mi) by 2019.[142] The system is operated by multiple companies.[238] Bus fares generally cost CN¥2 (US$0.32).[239] Shanghai also has three bus rapid transit systems, namely the Yan'an Road Medium Capacity Bus Transit System, Fengpu Express and Nantuan Express.\n\n\nAs of 2019[update], a total of 40,000 taxis were in operation in Shanghai.[142] The base fare for taxis is CN¥14 (US$2.24), which covers the first 3 km (2 mi) and includes a CN¥1 (US$0.14) fuel surcharge. The base fare is CN¥18 (US$2.55) between 11:00 pm and 5:00 am. Each additional kilometer costs CN¥2.7 (US$0.45), or CN¥4.05 (US$0.67) between 11:00 pm and 5:00 am.[240] Taxicabs and DiDi play major roles in urban transportation and DiDi is often cheaper than taxis.[241]\n\n\nAs of January 2021, Shanghai Metro has 459 stations and 772 km. The scale of operation is the first in the world. in 2017, the average daily passenger traffic of the Shanghai metro was 9.693 million, and the total passenger traffic reached 3.538 billion. It is one of the busiest metro cities in the world. The metro lines cover the central city densely and connect most districts and counties.[242]\n\n\n\n### Roads and expressways[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Expressways of Shanghai\n\n![](image)Interchange between Yan'an Elevated Road and North–South Elevated Road\nShanghai is a major hub of China's expressway network. Many national expressways (prefixed with the letter G) pass through or end in Shanghai, including Jinghu Expressway (overlaps with Hurong Expressway), Shenhai Expressway, Hushaan Expressway, Huyu Expressway, Hukun Expressway (overlaps with Hangzhou Bay Ring Expressway), and Shanghai Ring Expressway.[243] There are also numerous municipal expressways prefixed with the letter S.[243] As of 2019, Shanghai has a total of 12 bridges and 14 tunnels crossing the Huangpu River.[244][245] The Shanghai Yangtze River Bridge is the city's only bridge–tunnel complex across Yangtze River.\n\n\nThe expressway network within the city center consists of North–South Elevated Road, Yan'an Elevated Road, and Inner Ring Road. Other ring roads in Shanghai include Middle Ring Road, Outer Ring Expressway, and Shanghai Ring Expressway.\n\n\n\n![](image)Bicycle-sharing systems, such as ofo (yellow) and Mobike (orange), are common in Shanghai.\nBicycle lanes are common in Shanghai, separating non-motorized traffic from car traffic on most surface streets. However, on some main roads, including all expressways, bicycles and motorcycles are banned. In recent years, cycling has seen a resurgence in popularity due to the emergence of a large number of dockless app-based bicycle-sharing systems, such as Mobike, Bluegogo, and ofo.[246] As of December 2018[update], bicycle-sharing systems had an average of 1.15 million daily riders within the city.[247]\n\n\nPrivate car ownership in Shanghai is rapidly increasing: in 2019, there were 3.40 million private cars in the city, a 12.5% increase from 2018.[142] New private cars cannot be driven without a license plate, which are sold in monthly license plate auctions. Around 9,500 license plates are auctioned each month, and the average price is about CN¥89,600 (US$12,739) in 2019.[248] According to the city's vehicle regulations introduced in June 2016, only locally registered residents and those who have paid social insurance or individual income taxes for over three years are eligible to be in the auction. The purpose of this policy is to limit the growth of automobile traffic and alleviate congestion.[249]\n\n\n\n### Railways[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Shanghai railway station\nShanghai has four major railway stations: Shanghai railway station, Shanghai South railway station, Shanghai West railway station, and Shanghai Hongqiao railway station.[250] All are connected to the metro network and serve as hubs in the railway network of China. And now Shanghai has around twenty railway lines running under this city, which largely facilitate people's life in Shanghai.\n\n\nBuilt in 1876, the Woosung railway was the first railway in Shanghai and the first railway in operation in China[251] By 1909, Shanghai–Nanjing railway and Shanghai–Hangzhou railway were in service.[252][253] As of October 2019[update], the two railways have been integrated into two main railways in China: Beijing–Shanghai railway and Shanghai–Kunming railway, respectively.[254]\n\n\nShanghai has four high-speed railways (HSRs): Beijing–Shanghai HSR (overlaps with Shanghai–Wuhan–Chengdu passenger railway), Shanghai–Nanjing intercity railway, Shanghai–Kunming HSR, and Shanghai–Nantong railway. One HSR is under construction: Shanghai–Suzhou–Huzhou HSR.[255][256]\n\n\nShanghai also has four commuter railways: Pudong railway (passenger service is currently suspended) and Jinshan railway operated by China Railway, and Line 16 and Line 17 operated by Shanghai Metro.[257][258] As of January 2022[update], four additional lines—Chongming line, Jiamin line, Airport link line and Lianggang Express line—are under construction.[258][259]\n\n\n\n### Air and sea[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Port of Shanghai\n\n![](image)Inside Shanghai Pudong International Airport Terminal 1\n![](image)Due to Yangshan Port, Shanghai has become the world's busiest container port.\nShanghai is one of the largest air transportation hubs in Asia.[260] The city has two commercial airports: Shanghai Pudong International Airport and Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport.[261] Pudong International Airport is the primary international airport, while Hongqiao International Airport mainly operates domestic flights with limited short-haul international flights. In 2018, Pudong International Airport served 74.0 million passengers and handled 3.8 million tons of cargo, making it the ninth-busiest airport by passenger volume and third-busiest airport by cargo volume.[262][263] The same year, Hongqiao International Airport served 43.6 million passengers, making it the 19th-busiest airport by passenger volume.[262]\n\n\nSince its opening, the Port of Shanghai has rapidly grown to become the largest port in China.[264] Yangshan Port was built in 2005 because the river was unsuitable for docking large container ships. The port is connected with the mainland through the 32-kilometer (20 mi) long Donghai Bridge. Although the port is run by the Shanghai International Port Group under the government of Shanghai, it administratively belongs to Shengsi County, Zhejiang.[265]\n\n\nOvertaking the Port of Singapore in 2010,[266] the Port of Shanghai has become world's busiest container port with an annual TEU transportation of 42 million in 2018.[267] Besides cargo, the Port of Shanghai handled 259 cruises and 1.89 million passengers in 2019.[142]\n\n\nShanghai is part of the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road that runs from the Chinese coast to the south via the southern tip of India to Mombasa, from there to the Mediterranean, there to the Upper Adriatic region to the northern Italian hub of Trieste with its rail connections to Central and the Eastern Europe.[268][269][270][271][272]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Shanghai\n\n![](image)Shanghai Citi Bank Building operates a light show, shining the phrase \"I love Shanghai\".\nThe culture of Shanghai was formed by a combination of the nearby Wuyue culture and the \"East Meets West\" Haipai culture. Wuyue culture's influence is manifested in Shanghainese language—which comprises dialectal elements from nearby Jiaxing, Suzhou, and Ningbo—and Shanghai cuisine, which was influenced by Jiangsu cuisine and Zhejiang cuisine.[273] Haipai culture emerged after Shanghai became a prosperous port in the early 20th century, with numerous foreigners from Europe, America, Japan, and India moving into the city.[274] The culture fuses elements of Western cultures with the local Wuyue culture, and its influence extends to the city's literature, fashion, architecture, music, and cuisine.[275] The term Haipai—originally referring to a painting school in Shanghai—was coined by a group of Beijing writers in 1920 to criticize some Shanghai scholars for admiring capitalism and Western culture.[275][276] In the early 21st century, Shanghai has been recognized as a new influence and inspiration for cyberpunk culture.[277]\n\n\n\n### Museums[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of museums in China § Shanghai\n\n![](image)The China Art Museum, located in Pudong\nCultural curation in Shanghai has seen significant growth since 2013, with several new museums having been opened in the city.[278] This is in part due to the city's 2018 development plans, which aim to make Shanghai \"an excellent global city\".[279] As such, Shanghai has several museums of regional and national importance.[280][281] The Shanghai Museum has one of the largest collections of Chinese artifacts in the world, including a large collection of ancient Chinese bronzes and ceramics.[282] The China Art Museum, located in the former China Pavilion of Expo 2010, is one of the largest museums in Asia and displays an animated replica of the 12th century painting Along the River During the Qingming Festival.[283] The Shanghai Natural History Museum and the Shanghai Science and Technology Museum are notable natural history and science museums. In addition, there are numerous smaller, specialist museums housed in important archeological and historical sites, such as the Songze Museum,[284] the Museum of the First National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, the site of the former Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea,[285] the Shanghai Jewish Refugees Museum, and the Shanghai Post Office Museum (located in the General Post Office Building).[286]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Shanghainese cuisine\n\n![](image)Xiaolongbao in Shanghai\nBenbang cuisine (本帮菜)[287] is cooking style that originated in the 1600s, with influences from surrounding provinces. It emphasizes the use of condiments while retaining the original flavors of the raw ingredients. Sugar is an important ingredient in Benbang cuisine, especially when used in combination with soy sauce. Signature dishes of Benbang cuisine include Xiaolongbao, Red braised pork belly, and Shanghai hairy crab.[288] Haipai cuisine, on the other hand, is a Western-influenced cooking style that originated in Shanghai. It absorbed elements from French, British, Russian, German, and Italian cuisines and adapted them to suit the local taste according to the features of local ingredients.[289] Famous dishes of Haipai cuisine include Shanghai-style borscht (罗宋汤, \"Russian soup\"), crispy pork cutlets, and Shanghai salad derived from Olivier salad.[290] Both Benbang and Haipai cuisine make use of a variety of seafood, including freshwater fish, shrimps, and crabs.[291]\n\n\n\n### Arts[edit]\n\n\n![](image)十万图之四 (*No. 4 of a Hundred Thousand Scenes*) by Ren Xiong, a pioneer of the Shanghai School of Chinese art, c. 1850\nThe Songjiang School (淞江派), containing the Huating School (华亭派) founded by Gu Zhengyi,[292] was a small painting school in Shanghai during the Ming and Qing Dynasties.[293] It was represented by Dong Qichang.[294] The school was considered an expansion of the Wu School in Suzhou, the cultural center of the Jiangnan region at the time.[295] In the mid 19th century, the Shanghai School movement commenced, focusing less on the symbolism emphasized by the Literati style but more on the visual content of painting through the use of bright colors. Secular objects like flowers and birds were often selected as themes.[296] Western art was introduced to Shanghai in 1847 by Spanish missionary Joannes Ferrer (范廷佐), and the city's first Western atelier was established in 1864 inside the Tushanwan orphanage [zh; fr].[297] During the Republic of China, many famous artists including Zhang Daqian, Liu Haisu, Xu Beihong, Feng Zikai, and Yan Wenliang settled in Shanghai, allowing it to gradually become the art center of China. Various art forms—including photography, wood carving, sculpture, comics (Manhua), and Lianhuanhua—thrived. Sanmao was created to dramatize the chaos created by the Second Sino-Japanese War.[298] Today, the most comprehensive art and cultural facility in Shanghai is the China Art Museum. In addition, the Chinese Painting Academy features traditional Chinese painting,[299] while the Power Station of Art displays contemporary art.[300] The city also has many art galleries, many of which are located in the M50 Art District and Tianzifang. First held in 1996, the Shanghai Biennale has become an important place for Chinese and foreign arts to interact.[301]\n\n![](image)Mei Lanfang performing the Peking opera \"Resisting the Jin Army\" at Tianchan Theatre\nTraditional Chinese opera (Xiqu) became a popular source of public entertainment in the late 19th century. In the early 20th century, monologue and burlesque in Shanghainese appeared, absorbing elements from traditional dramas. The Great World opened in 1912 and was a significant stage at the time.[302] In the 1920s, Pingtan expanded from Suzhou to Shanghai.[303] Pingtan art developed rapidly to 103 programs every day by the 1930s because of the abundant commercial radio stations in the city. Around the same time, a Shanghai-style Beijing Opera was formed. Led by Zhou Xinfang and Gai Jiaotian [zh], it attracted many Xiqu masters, like Mei Lanfang, to the city.[304] A small troupe from Shengxian (now Shengzhou) also began to promote Yue opera on the Shanghainese stage.[305] A unique style of opera, Shanghai opera, was formed when local folksongs were fused with modern operas.[306] As of 2012, prominent troupes in Shanghai include Shanghai Jingju Theatre Company, Shanghai Kunqu Opera Troupe [zh], Shanghai Yue Opera House, and Shanghai Huju Opera House.[307]\n\n\nDrama appeared in missionary schools in Shanghai in the late 19th century. At the time, it was mainly performed in English. *Scandals in Officialdom* (官场丑史), staged in 1899, was one of the earliest-recorded plays.[308] In 1907, *Uncle Tom's Cabin; or, Life Among the Lowly* (黑奴吁天录) was performed at the Lyceum Theatre [zh].[309] After the New Culture Movement, drama became a popular way for students and intellectuals to express their views. The city has several major institutes of theater training, including the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, the Shanghai Dramatic Arts Centre, the Shanghai Opera House, and the Shanghai Theatre Academy. Notable theaters in Shanghai include the Shanghai Grand Theatre, the Oriental Art Center, and the People's Theatre.\n\n\n\n![](image)In this Shanghainese soap advertisement from the 1930s, two women are wearing Shanghai-styled *qipao* while playing golf.\nShanghai is considered to be the birthplace of Chinese cinema.[310] China's first short film, *The Difficult Couple* (1913), and the country's first fictional feature film, *An Orphan Rescues His Grandfather* (孤儿救祖记, 1923)[311] were both produced in Shanghai. Shanghai's film industry grew during the early 1930s, generating stars such as Hu Die, Ruan Lingyu, Zhou Xuan, Jin Yan, and Zhao Dan. Another film star, Jiang Qing, went on to become Madame Mao Zedong. The exile of Shanghainese filmmakers and actors as a result of the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Communist revolution contributed enormously to the development of the Hong Kong film industry.[312] The movie *In the Mood for Love* directed by Wong Kar-wai, a Shanghai native, depicts a slice of the displaced Shanghainese community in Hong Kong and the nostalgia for that era, featuring 1940s music by Zhou Xuan.[313]\n\n\nShanghai's cultural festivals include Shanghai International Television Festival, Shanghai International Film Festival, Shanghai International Art Festival, Shanghai International Tourism Festival, Shanghai Spring International Music Festival, etc. Shanghai TV Festival is the earliest international TV festival founded in China. It was founded in 1986. The Shanghai International Film Festival was founded in 1993 and is one of the nine major international film festivals in the A category. The highest award is the \"Golden Goblet Award\"[314]\n\n\n\n### Fashion[edit]\n\n\nSince 2001, Shanghai has held its own fashion week called Shanghai Fashion Week twice every year in April and October. The main venue is in Fuxing Park, and the opening and closing ceremonies are held in the Shanghai Fashion Center. The April session is also part of the one-month Shanghai International Fashion Culture Festival.[315] Shanghai Fashion Week is considered to be an event of national significance featuring both international and Chinese designers. The international presence has included many promising young British fashion designers.[316] The event is hosted by the Shanghai Municipal Government and supported by the People's Republic Ministry of Commerce.[317]\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\n![](image)F1 Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai\nShanghai is home to several football teams, including two in the Chinese Super League: Shanghai Shenhua[318] and Shanghai Port.[319] China's top-tier basketball team, the Shanghai Sharks of the Chinese Basketball Association, developed Yao Ming before he entered the NBA.[320][321] Shanghai's baseball team, the Shanghai Golden Eagles, plays in the China Baseball League.[322]\n\n\nThe Shanghai Cricket Club dates back to 1858 when the first recorded cricket match was played between a team of British Naval officers and a Shanghai 11. Following a 45-year dormancy after the founding of the PRC in 1949, the club was re-established in 1994 by expatriates living in the city and has since grown to over 300 members. The Shanghai cricket team played various international matches between 1866 and 1948. With cricket in the rest of China almost non-existent, for that period they were the de facto China national cricket team.[323]\n\n\n\n![](image)Yao Ming was born in Shanghai. He started his career with the Shanghai Sharks.\nShanghai is home to many prominent Chinese professional athletes, such as basketball player Yao Ming,[321] 110 metres hurdles Liu Xiang,[324] table tennis player Wang Liqin,[325] and badminton player Wang Yihan.[326]\n\n\n\n![](image)Shanghai Masters in Qizhong Forest Sports City Arena\nShanghai is the host of several international sports events. Since 2004, it has hosted the Chinese Grand Prix, a round of the Formula One World Championship. The race is staged annually at the Shanghai International Circuit.[327] It hosted the 1000th Formula One race on 14 April 2019. In 2010, Shanghai became the host city of Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters, which raced in a street circuit in Pudong. In 2012, Shanghai began hosting 4 Hours of Shanghai as one round from the inaugural season of the FIA World Endurance Championship. The city also hosts the Shanghai Masters tennis tournament, which is part of ATP World Tour Masters 1000, as well as golf tournaments including the BMW Masters and WGC-HSBC Champions.[328]\n\n\nOn 21 September 2017, Shanghai hosted a National Hockey League (NHL) ice hockey exhibition game in an effort to increase fan interest for the 2017–18 NHL season.[329]\n\n\n\n## Environment[edit]\n\n\n### Parks and resorts[edit]\n\n\nShanghai has an extensive public park system; by 2018, the city had 300 parks, of which 281 had free admission, and the per capita park area was 8.2 m2 (88 sq ft).[330] Some of the parks also have become popular tourist attractions due to their unique location, history, or architecture.\n\n\n\n![](image)People's Square\nThe People's Square park, located in the heart of downtown Shanghai, is especially well known for its proximity to other major landmarks in the city. Fuxing Park, located in the former French Concession, features formal French-style gardens and is surrounded by high-end bars and cafes.[331]\n\n\nZhongshan Park, in western central Shanghai, is famous for its monument of Chopin, the tallest statue dedicated to the composer in the world.[332] Built in 1914 as Jessfield Park, it once contained the campus of St. John's University, Shanghai's first international college; today, the park features sakura and peony gardens and a 150-year-old platanus,[333] and it also serves as an interchange hub in the metro system.[334]\n\n\nOne of Shanghai's newer parks is the Xujiahui Park, which was built in 1999, on the former grounds of the Great Chinese Rubber Works Factory and the EMI Recording Studio (now La Villa Rouge restaurant). The park has an artificial lake with a sky bridge running across the park.[335] Shanghai Botanical Garden is located 12 km (7 mi) southwest of the city center and was established in 1978. In 2011, the largest botanical garden in Shanghai—Shanghai Chen Shan Botanical Garden—opened in Songjiang District.[336]\n\n\n\n![](image)Enchanted Storybook Castle of Shanghai Disneyland\nOther notable parks in Shanghai include Lu Xun Park, Century Park, Gucun Park, Gongqing Forest Park, and Jing'an Park.\n\n\nThe Shanghai Disney Resort Project was approved by the government on 4 November 2009[337] and opened in 2016.[338]\nThe $4.4 billion theme park and resort in Pudong features a castle that is the biggest among Disney's resorts.[339] More than 11 million people visited the resort in its first year of operation.[340]\n\n\n\n### Air pollution[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Pollution in China § Air pollution\n\n![](image)Huangpu District during the 2013 Eastern China smog\nAir pollution in Shanghai is not as severe as in many other Chinese cities, but is still considered substantial by world standards.[341] During the December 2013 Eastern China smog, air pollution rates reached between 23 and 31 times the international standard.[342][343] On 6 December 2013, levels of PM2.5 particulate matter in Shanghai rose above 600 micrograms per cubic meter and in the surrounding area, above 700 micrograms per cubic meter.[343] Levels of PM2.5 in Putuo District reached 726 micrograms per cubic meter.[344][345] As a result, the Shanghai Municipal Education Commission received orders to suspend students' outdoor activities. Authorities pulled nearly one-third of government vehicles from the roads, while much construction work was halted. Most inbound flights were canceled, and more than 50 flights at Pudong International Airport were diverted.[346]\n\n\nOn 23 January 2014, Yang Xiong, the mayor of Shanghai, announced that three main measures would be taken to manage the air pollution in Shanghai, along with surrounding Anhui, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces.[347] The measures involved implementing the 2013 air-cleaning program, establishing a linkage mechanism with the three surrounding provinces, and improving the city's early-warning systems.[347] On 12 February 2014, China's cabinet announced that a CN¥10 billion (US$1.7 billion) fund will be set up to help companies meet the new environmental standards.[348] The effect of the policy was significant. From 2013 to 2018, more than 3,000 treatment facilities for industrial waste gases were installed, and the city's annual smoke, nitrogen oxide, and sulfur dioxide emission decreased by 65%, 54%, and 95%, respectively.[349][350]\n\n\n\n### Environmental protection[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A residual waste truck and a kitchen waste truck on Zhonghua Road\nPublic awareness of the environment is growing, and the city is investing in a number of environmental protection projects. A 16-year rehabilitation of Suzhou Creek, which runs through the city, was finished in 2012, clearing the creek of barges and factories and removing 1.3 million cubic meters of sludge.[351][352] Additionally, the government has moved almost all the factories within the city center to either the outskirts or other provinces,[353] and provided incentives for transportation companies to invest in LPG buses and taxis.\n\n\nOn 1 July 2019, Shanghai adopted a new garbage-classification system that sorts out waste into residual waste, kitchen waste, recyclable waste, and hazardous waste.[354] The wastes are collected by separate vehicles and sent to incineration plants, landfills, recycling centers, and hazardous-waste-disposal facilities, respectively.[355]\n\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\nMedia in Shanghai [zh] covers newspapers, publisher, broadcast, television, and Internet, with some media having influence over the country. In regard to foreign publications in Shanghai, Hartmut Walravens of the IFLA Newspapers Section said that when the Japanese controlled Shanghai in the 1940s \"it was very difficult to publish good papers – one either had to concentrate on emigration problems, or cooperate like the *Chronicle*\".[356]\n\n\nAs of March 2020[update], newspapers publishing in Shanghai include:\n\n\n\n* *Jiefang Daily*\n* *Oriental Sports Daily*\n* *Shanghai Review of Books*\n* *Shanghai Daily*\n* *Shanghai Star*\n* *Xinmin Evening News*\n* *Wen Hui Bao*\n* *Wenhui Book Review*\n\nNewspapers formerly

states. \n\n\n\n### Twin towns – sister cities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of twin towns and sister cities in China\n\nShanghai is twinned with:[361]\n\n\n\n* ![Japan](image) Yokohama, Japan (1973)\n*

Lying on both sides of the Yamuna river, but chiefly to the west, or beyond its right bank, Delhi shares borders with the state of Uttar Pradesh in the east and with the state of Haryana in the remaining directions. Delhi became a union territory on 1 November 1956 and the NCT in 1995.[15] The NCT covers an area of 1,484 square kilometres (573 sq mi).[5] According to the 2011 census, Delhi's city proper population was over 11 million,[6][16] while the NCT's population was about 16.8 million.[7]\n\n\nDelhi's urban agglomeration, which includes the satellite cities Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Gurgaon, Noida, Greater Noida, Meerut and YEIDA city in an area known as the National Capital Region (NCR), has an estimated population of over 28 million, making it the largest metropolitan area in India and the second-largest in the world (after Tokyo).[8]\n\n\nThe topography of the medieval fort Purana Qila on the banks of the river Yamuna matches the literary description of the citadel Indraprastha in the Sanskrit epic *Mahabharata*; however, excavations in the area have revealed no signs of an ancient built environment. From the early 13th century until the mid-19th century, Delhi was the capital of two major empires, the Delhi Sultanate and the Mughal Empire, which covered large parts of South Asia. All three UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the city, the Qutub Minar, Humayun's Tomb, and the Red Fort, belong to this period. Delhi was the early centre of Sufism and Qawwali music. The names of Nizamuddin Auliya and Amir Khusrau are prominently associated with it. The Khariboli dialect of Delhi was part of a linguistic development that gave rise to the literature of Urdu and later Modern Standard Hindi. Major Urdu poets from Delhi include Mir Taqi Mir and Mirza Ghalib. Delhi was a notable centre of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. In 1911, New Delhi, a southern region within Delhi, became the capital of the British Indian Empire. During the Partition of India in 1947, Delhi was transformed from a Mughal city to a Punjabi one, losing two-thirds of its Muslim residents, in part due to the pressure brought to bear by arriving Hindu and Sikh refugees from western Punjab.[17] After independence in 1947, New Delhi continued as the capital of the Dominion of India, and after 1950 of the Republic of India.\n\n\nDelhi ranks fifth among the Indian states and union territories in human development index,[18] and has the second-highest GDP per capita in India (after Goa).[19] Although a union territory, the political administration of the NCT of Delhi today more closely resembles that of a state of India, with its own legislature, high court and an executive council of ministers headed by a chief minister. New Delhi is jointly administered by the federal government of India and the local government of Delhi, and serves as the capital of the nation as well as the NCT of Delhi. Delhi is also the centre of the National Capital Region, which is an \"interstate regional planning\" area created in 1985.[20][21] Delhi hosted the inaugural 1951 Asian Games, the 1982 Asian Games, the 1983 Non-Aligned Movement summit, the 2010 Men's Hockey World Cup, the 2010 Commonwealth Games, and the 2012 BRICS summit and was one of the major host cities of the 2011 Cricket World Cup and 2023 Cricket World Cup\n\n\n\n\n## Toponym[edit]\n\n\nThere are a number of myths and legends associated with the origin of the name *Delhi*. One of them is derived from *Dhillu* or *Dilu*, a king who built a city at this location in 50 BCE and named it after himself.[22][23][24] Another legend holds that the name of the city is based on the Prakrit word *dhili* (*loose*) and that it was used by the Tomaras to refer to the city because the iron pillar of Delhi had a weak foundation and had to be moved.[24] According to Panjab Notes and Queries, the name of the city at the time of King Prithviraj was *dilpat*, and that *dilpat* and *dilli* are probably derived from the old Hindi word *dil* meaning \"eminence\". The former director of the Archaeological Survey of India, Alexander Cunningham, mentioned that *dilli* later became *dihli/dehli*.[25] Some suggest the coins in circulation in the region under the Tomaras were called *dehliwal*.[26] According to the Bhavishya Purana, King Prithiviraja of Indraprastha built a new fort in the modern-day Purana Qila area for the convenience of all four castes in his kingdom. He ordered the construction of a gateway to the fort and later named the fort *dehali*.[27] Some historians believe that *Dhilli* or *Dhillika* is the original name for the city while others believe the name could be a corruption of the Hindustani words *dehleez* or *dehali*—both terms meaning \"threshold\" or \"gateway\"—and symbolic of the city as a gateway to the Gangetic Plain.[28][29]\n\n\nThe people of Delhi are referred to as *Delhiites* or *Dilliwalas*.[30] The city is referenced in various idioms of the Northern Indo-Aryan languages. Examples include:\n\n\n\n* *Abhī Dillī dūr hai* (अभी दिल्ली दूर है / ابھی دلی دور ہے) or its Persian version, *Hanuz Dehli dur ast* (هنوز دهلی دور است), literally meaning \"Delhi is still far away\", which is generically said about a task or journey still far from completion.[31][32]\n* *Ās-pās barse, Dillī pānī tarse* (आस-पास बरसे, दिल्ली पानी तरसे / آس پاس برسے، دلی پانی ترسے), literally meaning \"It pours all around, while Delhi lies parched\". An allusion to the sometimes semi-arid climate of Delhi, it idiomatically refers to situations of deprivation when one is surrounded by plenty.[32]\n\n\nThe form *Delhi*, spelled in the Latin script with the *h* following the *l*, originated under colonial rule and is an alternation of the spelling based on the Urdu name of the city (دہلی, *Dehli*).[33]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of Delhi and Old Delhi\n\n### Ancient and Early Medieval Periods[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The walls of the 16th-century Purana Qila built on a mound matching ancient literary descriptions[34] Traditionally seven cities have been associated with the region of Delhi. The earliest, Indraprastha, is part of a literary description in the Sanskrit epic *Mahabharata* (composed c. 400 BCE to 200 CE but describing an earlier time) which situates a city on a knoll on the banks of the river Yamuna. According to art historian Catherine B. Asher, the topographical description of the *Mahabharata* matches the area of Purana Qila, a 14th-century CE fort of the Delhi sultanate, but the analogy does not go much further. Whereas the *Mahabharata* speaks of a beautifully decorated city with surrounding fortification, the excavations have yielded \"uneven findings of painted grey pottery characteristic of the eleventh century BCE; no signs of a built environment, much fewer fortifications, have been revealed.\"[34]\n\n\nThe earliest architectural relics date back to the Maurya period (c. 300 BCE); in 1966, an inscription of the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka (273–235 BCE) was discovered near Srinivaspuri. Remains of several major cities can be found in Delhi. The first of these was in the southern part of present-day Delhi. Tomara Rajput King Anang Pal built the Lal Kot and several temples in 1052 CE. The Chauhan Rajputs under Vigraharaja IV conquered Lal Kot in the mid-12th century and renamed it Qila Rai Pithora.\n\n\n\n### Late Medieval Period[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Delhi Sultanate\n\n![](image)The Qutub Minar, Delhi\nPrithviraj Chauhan was defeated in 1192 by Muhammad Ghori in the second battle of Tarain. Qutb-ud-din Aibak, was given the responsibility of governing the conquered territories of India after Ghori returned to his capital, Ghor. When Ghori died without an heir in 1206 CE, Qutb-ud-din assumed control of Ghori's Indian possessions and laid the foundation of the Delhi Sultanate and the Mamluk dynasty. He began construction of the Qutb Minar and Quwwat-al-Islam (Might of Islam) mosque, the earliest extant mosque in India. It was his successor, Iltutmish (1211–1236), who consolidated the Turkic conquest of northern India.[22][35] At 72.5 m (238 ft), the Qutb Minar, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Delhi,[36] was completed during the reign of Sultan Illtutmish in the 13th century. Although its style has some similarities with the Jarkurgan minaret, it is more closely related to the Ghaznavid and Ghurid minarets of Central Asia[37] Razia, daughter of Iltutmish, became the Sultana of Delhi upon the former's death.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nFor the next three hundred years, Delhi was ruled by a succession of Turkic and an Afghan, Lodi dynasty. They built several forts and townships that are part of the seven cities of Delhi.[38] Delhi was a major centre of Sufism during this period.[39] The Mamluk Sultanate (Delhi) was overthrown in 1290 by Jalal ud din Firuz Khalji (1290–1320). Under the second Khalji ruler, Ala-ud-din Khalji, the Delhi sultanate extended its control south of the Narmada River in the Deccan. The Delhi sultanate reached its greatest extent during the reign of Muhammad bin Tughluq (1325–1351). In an attempt to bring the whole of the Deccan under control, he moved his capital to Daulatabad, Maharashtra in central India. However, by moving away from Delhi he lost control of the north and was forced to return to Delhi to restore order. The southern provinces then broke away. In the years following the reign of Firoz Shah Tughlaq (1351–1388), the Delhi Sultanate rapidly began to lose its hold over its northern provinces. Delhi was captured and sacked by Timur in 1398,[40] who massacred 100,000 captive civilian.[41] Delhi's decline continued under the Sayyid dynasty (1414–1451), until the sultanate was reduced to Delhi and its hinterland. Under the Afghan Lodi dynasty (1451–1526), the sultanate recovered control of Punjab and the Gangetic plain to once again achieve domination over Northern India. However, the recovery was short-lived and the sultanate was destroyed in 1526 by Babur, founder of the Mughal dynasty.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Early Modern Period[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Mughal Empire\n\n![Red Fort with the Indian Flag at the centre](image)Red Fort, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, was the main residence of the Mughal emperors for nearly 200 years.\nIn 1526, Babur, a descendant of Genghis Khan and Timur from the Fergana Valley in modern-day Uzbekistan, invaded India and defeated the last Lodhi sultan in the First Battle of Panipat and founded the Mughal Empire that ruled from Delhi and Agra.[22] The Mughal dynasty ruled Delhi for more than three centuries, with a sixteen-year hiatus during the reigns of Sher Shah Suri and Hemu from 1540 to 1556.[42] Shah Jahan built the seventh city of Delhi that bears his name *Shahjahanabad*, which served as the capital of the Mughal Empire from 1638 and is today known as the *Old City* or *Old Delhi*.[43]\n\n\nAfter the death of Aurangzeb in 1707, the Mughal Empire's influence declined rapidly as the Hindu Maratha Empire from Deccan Plateau rose to prominence.[44] In 1737, Maratha forces led by Baji Rao I sacked Delhi following their victory against the Mughals in the First Battle of Delhi. In 1739, the Mughal Empire lost the huge Battle of Karnal in less than three hours against the numerically outnumbered but militarily superior Persian army led by Nader Shah of Persia. After his invasion, he completely sacked and looted Delhi, carrying away immense wealth including the Peacock Throne, the Daria-i-Noor, and Koh-i-Noor. The Mughals, severely further weakened, could never overcome this crushing defeat and humiliation which also left the way open for more invaders to come, including eventually the British.[45][46][47] Nader eventually agreed to leave the city and India after forcing the Mughal emperor Muhammad Shah I to beg him for mercy and granting him the keys of the city and the royal treasury.[48] A treaty signed in 1752 made Marathas the protectors of the Mughal throne in Delhi.[49] The city was sacked again in 1757 by the forces of Ahmad Shah Durrani, although it was not annexed by the Afghan Empire and being its vassal state under the Mughal emperor. Then the Marathas battled and won control of Delhi from the Mughals.[50] By the end of the century, Delhi had also come under control of the Bharatpur State and the Sikh Empire.\n\n\n\n### Colonial Period[edit]\n\n\nSee also: British Raj\n\n![](image)British India stamps, inauguration, New Delhi, February 1931\nIn 1803, during the Second Anglo-Maratha War, the forces of British East India Company defeated the Maratha forces in the Battle of Delhi.[51] During the Indian Rebellion of 1857, Delhi fell to the forces of East India Company after a bloody fight known as the Siege of Delhi. The city came under the direct control of the British Government in 1858. It was made a district province of the Punjab.[22] In 1911, it was announced that the capital of British-held territories in India was to be transferred from Calcutta to Delhi.[52] This formally transferred on 12 December 1911.[53]\n\n\nThe name \"New Delhi\" was given in 1927, and the new capital was inaugurated on 13 February 1931. New Delhi was officially declared as the capital of the Union of India after the country gained independence on 15 August 1947.[54] It has expanded since; the small part of it that was constructed during the British period has come to be informally known as *Lutyens' Delhi*.[55]\n\n\n\n### Partition and post-independence[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Khan Market in New Delhi, now a high-end shopping district, was established in 1951 to help refugees of the Partition of India, especially those from the North West Frontier Province (NWFP). It honours Khan Abdul Jabbar Khan, chief minister of NWFP during the Partition.[56][57]\nDuring the partition of India, around five hundred thousand Hindu and Sikh refugees, mainly from West Punjab fled to Delhi, while around three hundred thousand Muslim residents of the city migrated to Pakistan.[58][59] Ethnic Punjabis are believed to account for at least 40% of Delhi's total population and are predominantly Hindi-speaking Punjabi Hindus.[60][61][62] Migration to Delhi from the rest of India continues (as of 2013[update]), contributing more to the rise of Delhi's population than the birth rate, which is declining.[63]\n\n\nThe States Reorganisation Act, 1956 created the Union Territory of Delhi from its predecessor, the *Chief Commissioner's Province of Delhi*.[1][2] The Constitution (Sixty-ninth Amendment) Act, 1991 declared the Union Territory of Delhi to be formally known as the National Capital Territory of Delhi.[3] The Act gave Delhi its legislative assembly along Civil lines, though with limited powers.[3]\n\n\nDelhi was the primary site in the nationwide anti-Sikh pogroms of 1984, which resulted in the death of around 2,800 people in the city according to government figures, though independent estimates of the number of people killed tend to be higher. The riots were set off by the assassination of Indira Gandhi—the Prime Minister of India at the time—by her Sikh bodyguards.[64]\n\n\nIn 2001, the Parliament of India building in New Delhi was attacked by armed militants, killing six security personnel.[65] India suspected Pakistan-based Jihadist militant groups were behind the attack, which caused a major diplomatic crisis between the two countries.[66] There were further terrorist attacks in Delhi in 2005 and 2008, resulting in a total of 92 deaths.[67][68] In 2020, Delhi witnessed worst communal violence in decades. The riots, caused mainly by Hindu mobs attacking Muslims,[69][70] 53 people were killed, two-thirds were Muslims,[71][72][73] and the rest Hindus.[72]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Environment of Delhi\n\n![](image)Aerial view of Delhi in April 2016 with river Yamuna in top-right\nDelhi is located in Northern India, at 28°37′N 77°14′E﻿ / ﻿28.61°N 77.23°E﻿ / 28.61; 77.23. The city is bordered on its northern, western, and southern sides by the state of Haryana and to the east by that of Uttar Pradesh (UP). Two prominent features of the geography of Delhi are the Yamuna flood plains and the Delhi ridge. The Yamuna River was the historical boundary between Punjab and UP, and its flood plains provide fertile alluvial soil suitable for agriculture but are prone to recurrent floods. The Yamuna, a sacred river in Hinduism, is the only major river flowing through Delhi. The Hindon River separates Ghaziabad from the eastern part of Delhi. The Delhi ridge originates from the Aravalli Range in the south and encircles the west, northeast, and northwest parts of the city. It reaches a height of 318 m (1,043 ft) and is a dominant feature of the region.[74]\n\n\nIn addition to the wetlands formed by the Yamuna river, Delhi continues to retain over 500 ponds (wetlands < 5 ha (12 acres)), that in turn support considerable number of bird species.[75] Delhi's ponds, despite experiencing ecological deterioration due to garbage dumping and concretisation, supports the largest number of bird species known to be using ponds anywhere in the world.[76] Existing policy in Delhi prevents the conversion of wetlands and, quite inadvertently, has led to the city's ponds becoming invaluable refugia for birds.[75][76]\n\n\nThe National Capital Territory of Delhi covers an area of 1,483 km2 (573 sq mi), of which 783 km2 (302 sq mi) is designated rural, and 700 km2 (270 sq mi) urban therefore making it the largest city in terms of area in the country. It has a length of 51.9 km (32 mi) and a width of 48.48 km (30 mi).[*citation needed*] Delhi is included in India's seismic zone-IV, indicating its vulnerability to major earthquakes.[77]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Climate of Delhi\n\nDelhi features a dry winter humid subtropical climate (Köppen *Cwa*) bordering a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen *BSh*). The warm season lasts from 21 March to 15 June with an average daily high temperature above 39 °C (102 °F). The hottest day of the year is usually witnessed between 26 and 30 May, with an average high of 42 °C (108 °F) and low of 27 °C (81 °F).[78] The cold season lasts from 26 November to 9 February with an average daily high temperature below 20 °C (68 °F). The coldest day of the year is usually witnessed between 16 and 20 January, with an average low of 7 °C (45 °F) and high of 20 °C (68 °F).[78] In early March, the wind direction changes from north-westerly to south-westerly. From April to October the weather is hot. The monsoon arrives at the end of June, along with an increase in humidity.[*citation needed*] The brief, mild winter starts in late November, peaks in January and heavy fog often occurs.[79]\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nClimate data for New Delhi (Safdarjung) 1991–2020, extremes 1901–present\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 32.5(90.5)\n | 34.1(93.4)\n | 40.6(105.1)\n | 45.6(114.1)\n | 47.2(117.0)\n | 46.7(116.1)\n | 45.0(113.0)\n | 42.0(107.6)\n | 40.6(105.1)\n | 39.4(102.9)\n | 36.1(97.0)\n | 30.0(86.0)\n | 47.2(117.0)\n |\n| Mean maximum °C (°F)\n | 25.8(78.4)\n | 29.5(85.1)\n | 35.8(96.4)\n | 41.4(106.5)\n | 44.3(111.7)\n | 43.7(110.7)\n | 40.1(104.2)\n | 37.4(99.3)\n | 37.1(98.8)\n | 36.1(97.0)\n | 32.2(90.0)\n | 27.3(81.1)\n | 44.8(112.6)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 20.1(68.2)\n | 24.2(75.6)\n | 29.9(85.8)\n | 36.5(97.7)\n | 39.9(103.8)\n | 39.0(102.2)\n | 35.6(96.1)\n | 34.2(93.6)\n | 34.1(93.4)\n | 33.0(91.4)\n | 28.4(83.1)\n | 22.8(73.0)\n | 31.4(88.5)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 13.9(57.0)\n | 17.6(63.7)\n | 22.9(73.2)\n | 29.1(84.4)\n | 32.7(90.9)\n | 33.3(91.9)\n | 31.5(88.7)\n | 30.4(86.7)\n | 29.6(85.3)\n | 26.2(79.2)\n | 20.5(68.9)\n | 15.6(60.1)\n | 25.3(77.5)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 7.5(45.5)\n | 10.6(51.1)\n | 15.6(60.1)\n | 21.3(70.3)\n | 25.8(78.4)\n | 27.7(81.9)\n | 27.5(81.5)\n | 26.7(80.1)\n | 25.0(77.0)\n | 19.5(67.1)\n | 13.0(55.4)\n | 8.4(47.1)\n | 18.9(66.0)\n |\n| Mean minimum °C (°F)\n | 3.5(38.3)\n | 6.0(42.8)\n | 10.7(51.3)\n | 16.3(61.3)\n | 20.5(68.9)\n | 22.2(72.0)\n | 24.3(75.7)\n | 23.7(74.7)\n | 21.9(71.4)\n | 15.0(59.0)\n | 8.8(47.8)\n | 4.5(40.1)\n | 3.1(37.6)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −0.6(30.9)\n | 1.6(34.9)\n | 4.4(39.9)\n | 10.7(51.3)\n | 15.1(59.2)\n | 17.6(63.7)\n | 20.3(68.5)\n | 20.7(69.3)\n | 16.1(61.0)\n | 9.4(48.9)\n | 3.9(39.0)\n | 0.0(32.0)\n | −0.6(30.9)\n |\n| Average rainfall mm (inches)\n | 19.1(0.75)\n | 21.3(0.84)\n | 17.4(0.69)\n | 16.3(0.64)\n | 30.7(1.21)\n | 74.1(2.92)\n | 209.7(8.26)\n | 233.1(9.18)\n | 123.5(4.86)\n | 15.1(0.59)\n | 6.0(0.24)\n | 8.1(0.32)\n | 774.4(30.5)\n |\n| Average rainy days\n | 1.7\n | 1.5\n | 1.7\n | 1.0\n | 2.7\n | 4.8\n | 9.7\n | 10.2\n | 5.5\n | 0.8\n | 0.4\n | 0.6\n | 40.6\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%) (at 17:30 IST) | 57\n | 46\n | 37\n | 25\n | 28\n | 43\n | 63\n | 68\n | 60\n | 47\n | 52\n | 59\n | 49\n |\n| Average dew point °C (°F)\n | 8(46)\n | 11(52)\n | 14(57)\n | 14(57)\n | 18(64)\n | 22(72)\n | 26(79)\n | 25(77)\n | 23(73)\n | 18(64)\n | 14(57)\n | 10(50)\n | 17(62)\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 220.1\n | 223.2\n | 248.0\n | 276.0\n | 285.2\n | 219.0\n | 179.8\n | 176.7\n | 219.0\n | 260.4\n | 246.0\n | 220.1\n | 2,773.5\n |\n| Mean daily sunshine hours | 7.1\n | 7.9\n | 8.0\n | 9.2\n | 9.2\n | 7.3\n | 5.8\n | 5.7\n | 7.3\n | 8.4\n | 8.2\n | 7.1\n | 7.6\n |\n| Mean daily daylight hours | 10.6\n | 11.2\n | 12.0\n | 12.9\n | 13.6\n | 13.9\n | 13.8\n | 13.1\n | 12.3\n | 11.5\n | 10.7\n | 10.3\n | 12.2\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 67\n | 71\n | 67\n | 71\n | 68\n | 53\n | 42\n | 44\n | 59\n | 73\n | 77\n | 69\n | 63\n |\n| Average ultraviolet index | 3\n | 5\n | 6\n | 7\n | 9\n | 9\n | 8\n | 7\n | 6\n | 5\n | 4\n | 3\n | 6\n |\n| Source 1: India Meteorological Department (sun 1971–2000);[80][81][82][83][84][85][86][87][88][89][90][91][92][93] Time and Date (dewpoints, 2005–2015)[94] Revised Rainfall data[95] |\n| Source 2: Tokyo Climate Center (mean temperatures 1991–2020);[96] Weather Atlas (UV Index)[97](Daylight)[98] |\n\n### Air pollution[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Environmental issues in Delhi and Air pollution in Delhi\n\n![](image)A dense toxic smog in Delhi blocking out the sun, November 2017\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), Delhi was the most polluted[99] city in the world in 2014. In 2016, WHO downgraded Delhi to eleventh-worst in the urban air quality database.[100] According to one estimate, air pollution causes the death of about 10,500 people every year.[101][102][103] Air quality index is generally moderate (101–200) level between January and September, and then it drastically deteriorates to Very Poor (301–400), Severe (401–500) or Hazardous (500+) levels in three months between October and December,[104][105] due to various factors including stubble burning (a type of biomass burning), fire crackers burning during Diwali and cold weather.[106][107][108] During 2013–14, peak levels of fine particulate matter (PM) increased by about 44%, primarily due to high vehicular and industrial emissions, construction work and crop burning in adjoining states.[101][109][110][111] It has the highest level of the airborne particulate matter, PM2.5 considered most harmful to health, with 153 micrograms.[112]\n\n\nRising air pollution level has significantly increased lung-related ailments (especially asthma and lung cancer) among Delhi's children and women.[113][114] The dense smog and haze during winter results in major air and rail traffic disruptions every year.[115] According to Indian meteorologists, the average maximum temperature during winters has declined notably since 1998 due to rising air pollution.[116]\n\n\nIndia's Ministry of Earth Sciences published a research paper in October 2018 attributing almost 41% of PM2.5 air pollution in Delhi to vehicular emissions, 21.5% to dust/fire and 18% to industries.[117] The director of Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) alleged that the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) is lobbying \"against the report\" because it is \"inconvenient\" to the automobile industry.[118] Environmentalists have also criticised the Delhi government for not doing enough to curb air pollution and to inform people about air quality issues.[102] In 2014, an environmental panel appealed to India's Supreme Court to impose a 30% cess on diesel cars, but till date no action has been taken to penalise the automobile industry.[119]\n\n\nMost of Delhi's residents are unaware of alarming levels of air pollution in the city and the health risks associated with it.[110][111] In 2020, annual average PM2.5 in the city stood at 107.6 µg/m³, which is almost 21.5 times the WHO's PM2.5 Guideline (5 µg/m³; set in September 2021).[120] These pollution levels are estimated to reduce the life expectancy of an average person living in Delhi by almost 10.1 years.[120]\n\n\nHowever, as of 2015[update], awareness, particularly among the foreign diplomatic community and high-income Indians, was noticeably increasing.[121] Since the mid-1990s, Delhi has undertaken some measures to curb air pollution—it has the third-highest quantity of trees among Indian cities;[122] the Delhi Transport Corporation operates the world's largest fleet of environmentally friendly compressed natural gas (CNG) buses.[123] In 1996, the CSE started a public interest litigation in the Supreme Court of India that ordered the conversion of Delhi's fleet of buses and taxis to run on CNG and banned the use of leaded petrol in 1998. In 2003, Delhi won the United States Department of Energy's first 'Clean Cities International Partner of the Year' award for its \"bold efforts to curb air pollution and support alternative fuel initiatives\".[123] The Delhi Metro has also been credited for significantly reducing air pollutants in the city.[124]\n\n\nHowever, according to several authors, most of these gains have been lost, especially due to stubble burning, a rise in the market share of diesel cars and a considerable decline in bus ridership.[125][126] According to CSE and System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), burning of agricultural waste in nearby Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh regions results in severe intensification of smog over Delhi.[127][128]\n\n\n\n## Civic administration[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Districts of Delhi, Neighbourhoods of Delhi, and List of towns in National Capital Territory of Delhi\n\n![](image)Logo of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi\n![](image)Districts of Delhi\nCurrently, the NCT of Delhi is made up of one division, 11 districts, 33 subdivisions, 59 census towns, and 300 villages.[129]\n\n\n\n![](image)Municipalities of Delhi\nOn the other way, the NCT of Delhi is divided into three municipalities. The boundaries of municipalities may be different from district boundaries:\n\n\n\n1. Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD), which occupies an area of 1397.3 km2 and is sub-divided into 12 zones, that is, Centre, South, West, Najafgarh, Rohini, Civil Lines, Karol Bagh, SP-City, Keshavpuram, Narela, Shahdara North and Shahdara South.[130]\n2. New Delhi Municipality , which occupies an area of 42.7 km2\n3.

East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) had jurisdiction over areas such as Patparganj, Kondli, Laxmi Nagar, Seemapuri, Gonda, Karawal Nagar, Babarpur and Shahadra.[132]\n\n\nDelhi is home to the High Court of Delhi. The High Court of Delhi is the highest in the Delhi before Supreme Court. The High Court of Delhi just like the apex court and other High Courts in India is the Court of record. Delhi is also home to various District Court according to jurisdictions. Delhi have Currently seven District Courts namely Tis Hazari Court Complex, Karkardooma Court Complex, Patiala House Court Complex, Rohini Court Complex, Dwarka Courts Complex, Saket Court Complex, and Rouse Avenue Court \nApart from the District Courts Delhi also have Consumer Courts, CBI Courts, Labour Courts, Revenue Courts, Army tribunals, electricity tribunals, Railway Tribunals, and other various tribunals situated according to appropriate jurisdictions.[133][134]\n\n\nFor policing purposes Delhi is divided into fifteen police districts which are further subdivided into 95 local police station zones. Delhi currently has 180 police stations.[135][136]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Government of Delhi and Government of India\n\n![](image)\nArvind Kejriwal is the seventh and current Chief Minister of Delhi, first elected in February 2015.\n![](image)\nDelhi Legislative Assembly\n\nAs a first-level administrative division, the National Capital Territory of Delhi has its own Legislative Assembly, Lieutenant Governor, the council of ministers, and Chief Minister. Members of the legislative assembly are directly elected from territorial constituencies in the NCT. The legislative assembly was abolished in 1956, after which direct federal control was implemented until it was re-established in 1993. The Municipal corporation handles civic administration for the city as part of the Panchayati Raj Act. The Government of India and the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi jointly administer New Delhi, where both bodies are located. The Parliament of India, the Rashtrapati Bhavan (Presidential Palace), Cabinet Secretariat, and the Supreme Court of India are located in the municipal district of New Delhi. There are 70 assembly constituencies and seven Lok Sabha (Indian parliament's lower house) constituencies in Delhi.[137][138]\nThe Indian National Congress (Congress) formed all the governments in Delhi until the 1990s, when the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), led by Madan Lal Khurana, came to power.[139] In 1998, the Congress returned to power under the leadership of Sheila Dikshit, who was subsequently re-elected for 3 consecutive terms. But in 2013, the Congress was ousted from power by the newly formed Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) led by Arvind Kejriwal forming the government with outside support from the Congress.[140] However, that government was short-lived, collapsing only after 49 days.[141] Delhi was then under President's rule until February 2015.[142] On 10 February 2015, the Aam Aadmi Party returned to power after a landslide victory, winning 67 out of the 70 seats in the Delhi Legislative Assembly.[143]\nOn 8 February 2020, Aam Aadmi Party surged to power in Delhi for a third term, boosted by a massive mandate of 62 seats.[144]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Delhi\n\n![](image)\nThe Khari Baoli market in Old Delhi is one of the oldest and busiest in the city.\n![](image)\nConnaught Place in New Delhi is an important economic hub of the National Capital Region.\n\nDelhi is the largest commercial center in northern India. As of 2016[update] recent estimates of the economy of the Delhi urban area have ranged from $370 billion to $400 billion (PPP metro GDP) ranking it either the most or second-most productive metro area of India.[145] The nominal GSDP of the NCT of Delhi for 2016–17 was estimated at ₹6,224 billion (US$75 billion), 13% higher than in 2015–16.[146][147]\n\n\nAs per the Economic survey of Delhi (2005–2006), the tertiary sector contributes 70.95% of Delhi's gross SDP followed by secondary and primary sectors with 25.20% and 3.85% contributions, respectively.[148] Delhi's workforce constitutes 32.82% of the population, and increased by 52.52% between 1991 and 2001.[149] Delhi's unemployment rate decreased from 12.57% in 1999–2000 to 4.63% in 2003.[149] In December 2004, 636,000 people were registered with various employment exchange programmes in Delhi.[149]\n\n\nIn 2018 the total workforce in national and state governments and the quasi-government sector was 594,000, and the private sector employed 273,000.[150] Key service industries are information technology, telecommunications, hotels, banking, media and tourism.[151] Construction, power, health and community services and real estate are also important to the city's economy. Delhi has one of India's largest and fastest growing retail industries.[152] Manufacturing also grew considerably as consumer goods companies established manufacturing units and headquarters in the city. Delhi's large consumer market and the availability of skilled labour has also attracted foreign investment. In 2001, the manufacturing sector employed 1,440,000 workers and the city had 129,000 industrial units.[153]\n\n\n\n## Utility services[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Bhalswa landfill\n\nDelhi's municipal water supply is managed by the Delhi Jal Board (DJB). As of June 2005[update], it supplied 650 million gallons per day (MGD), whereas the estimated consumption requirement is 963 MGD.[154] The shortfall is met by private and public tube wells and hand pumps. At 240 MGD, the Bhakra storage is DJB's largest water source, followed by the Yamuna and Ganges rivers. Delhi's groundwater level is falling and its population density is increasing, so residents often encounter acute water shortage.[154] Research on Delhi suggests that up to half of the city's water use is unofficial groundwater.[155]  \nIn Delhi, daily domestic solid waste production is 8000 tonnes which is dumped at three landfill locations by MCD.[156] The daily domestic waste water production is 470 MGD and industrial waste water is 70 MGD.[157] A large portion of the sewage flows untreated into the Yamuna river.[157]\n\n\nThe city's electricity consumption is about 1,265 kWh per capita but the actual demand is higher.[158] In Delhi power distribution is managed by TPDDL and BSES Yamuna & BSES Rajdhani since 2002. The Delhi Fire Service runs 43 fire stations that attend about 15,000 fire and rescue calls per year.[159] The state-owned BSNL and private enterprises such as Airtel, Vi, Jio, and provide telephone and cell phone services to the city. Cellular coverage is available in GSM, CDMA, 3G, 4G and 4G+.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Delhi\n\n### Air[edit]\n\n\n![Shown here is the check-in counter at Terminal 3 of the airport.](image)Indira Gandhi International Airport's immigration counter in Terminal 3[160]\nIndira Gandhi International Airport, situated to the south-west of Delhi, is the main gateway for the city's domestic and international civilian air traffic. In 2015–16, the airport handled more than 48 million passengers,[161] making it the busiest airport in India and South Asia. Terminal 3, which cost ₹96.8 billion (US$1.2 billion) to construct between 2007 and 2010, handles an additional 37 million passengers annually.[162] In 2010, IGIA was conferred the 4th best airport award in the world in the 15–25 million category, by Airports Council International. The airport was rated as the *Best airport in the world* in the 25–40 million passengers category in 2015, by Airports Council International. Delhi Airport was awarded *The Best Airport in Central Asia* and *Best Airport Staff in Central Asia* at the Skytrax World Airport Awards 2015.[163][164] Hindon Domestic Airport in Ghaziabad was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as the second airport for the Delhi-NCR Region on 8 March 2019.[165] A second international airport open for commercial flights has been suggested either by expansion of Meerut Airport or construction of a new airport in Greater Noida.[166]\nThe Taj International Airport project in Jewar has been approved by the Uttar Pradesh government.[167]\n\n\nThe *Delhi Flying Club*, established in 1928 with two de Havilland Moth aircraft named *Delhi* and *Roshanara*, was based at Safdarjung Airport which started operations in 1929, when it was the Delhi's only airport and the second in India.[168] The airport functioned until 2001; however, in January 2002 the government closed the airport for flying activities because of security concerns following the New York attacks in September 2001. Since then, the club only carries out aircraft maintenance courses and is used for helicopter rides to Indira Gandhi International Airport for VIP including the president and the prime minister.[168][169]\n\n\n\n### Road[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nCompressed natural gas red- and green buses have low floors; orange has standard.[b]\n![](image)\nThe cycle rickshaw and the auto rickshaw are commonly used in Delhi for travelling short distances.\n\nDelhi has the highest road density of 2103 km/100 km2 in India.[171] It is connected to other parts of India by five National Highways: NH 1, NH 2, NH 8, NH 10 and NH 24. The Delhi–Mumbai and Delhi–Kolkata prongs of the Golden Quadrilateral start from the city. The majority of the city's roads which are 60 ft. wide or above are maintained by the Public Works Department (PWD)[172] which is under the jurisdiction of the Government of Delhi while some are maintained by Delhi Development Authority and New Delhi Municipal Council[173] which are under the jurisdiction of the Government of India. Roads and streets less than 60 ft wide are maintained by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi. Roads and streets in unauthorised colonies are maintained by the local Member of the Legislative Assembly.[174]\n\n\nBuses are the most popular means of road transport catering to about 60% of Delhi's total demand.[175] Delhi has one of India's largest bus transport systems. In 1998, the Supreme Court of India ruled that all public transport vehicles in Delhi must be fuelled by compressed natural gas (CNG) to tackle increasing vehicular pollution.[176] The state-owned Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) is a major bus service provider which operates the world's largest fleet of CNG-fuelled buses.[177][178] In addition, cluster scheme buses are operated by Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System (DIMTS) with the participation of private concessionaires and DTC.[179][180] In December 2017, the DTC and cluster buses carried over 4.19 million passengers per day.[181] Kashmiri Gate ISBT, Anand Vihar ISBT and Sarai Kale Khan ISBT are the main bus terminals for outstation buses plying to neighbouring states. Delhi's rapid rate of economic development and population growth has resulted in an increasing demand for transport, creating excessive pressure on the city's transport infrastructure. To meet the transport demand, the State and Union government constructed a mass rapid transit system, including the Delhi Metro.[182] Delhi Bus Rapid Transit System runs between Ambedkar Nagar and Delhi Gate.\n\n\nPersonal vehicles especially cars also form a major chunk of vehicles plying on Delhi roads. As of 2007[update], private vehicles account for 30% of the total demand for transport.[182] Delhi has the highest number of registered cars compared to any other metropolitan city in India.[183] Taxis, auto rickshaws, and cycle rickshaws also ply on Delhi roads in large numbers. As of 2008[update], the number of vehicles in the metropolitan region, Delhi NCR, was 11.2 million (11.2 million).[184] In 2008, there were 85 cars in Delhi for every 1,000 of its residents.[185] In 2017, the number of vehicles in Delhi city alone crossed the ten million mark with the transport department of Delhi Government putting the total number of registered vehicles at 10,567,712 until 25 May of the year.[186]\n\n\n\n### Railway[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A passenger train at the New Delhi railway station. Freight awaits pick up or transportation to other destinations.\nDelhi is a major junction in the Indian railway network and is the headquarters of the Northern Railway. The main railway stations are New Delhi, Old Delhi, Hazrat Nizamuddin, Anand Vihar, Delhi Sarai Rohilla and Delhi Cantt.[182] The Delhi Metro, a mass rapid transit system built and operated by Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), serves many parts of Delhi and the neighbouring cities Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Gurgaon and Noida.[187] As of December 2021[update], the metro consists of ten operational lines with a total length of 348.12 km (216.31 mi) and 254 stations, and several other lines are under construction.[188] The Phase-I was built at a cost of US$2.3 billion and the Phase-II was expected to cost an additional ₹216 billion (US$2.6 billion).[189] Phase-II has a total length of 128 km and was completed by 2010.[190] Delhi Metro completed 10 years of operation on 25 December 2012. It carries millions of passengers every day.[191] In addition to the Delhi Metro, a suburban railway, the Delhi Suburban Railway exists.[192]\n\n\n\n### Metro[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Delhi Metro is widely used in the NCR.\nThe Delhi Metro is a rapid transit system serving Delhi, Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Gurgaon and Noida in the National Capital Region of India. It is the world's tenth-largest metro system by length of lines. It was India's second modern public transportation system. The network consists of 10 colour-coded lines[193] serving 255 stations[c] with a total length of 348.12 kilometres (216.31 mi).[d] The system has a mix of underground, at-grade, and elevated stations using both broad-gauge and standard-gauge. All stations have escalators, lifts, and tactile tiles to guide the visually impaired from station entrances to trains. There are 18 designated parking sites at the Metro stations. In March 2010, DMRC partnered with Google India (through Google Transit) to provide train schedule and route information to mobile devices with Google Maps.\nIt has a combination of elevated, at-grade, and underground lines, and uses both broad gauge and standard gauge rolling stock. Four types of rolling stock are used: Mitsubishi–ROTEM Broad gauge, Bombardier MOVIA, Mitsubishi–ROTEM Standard gauge, and CAF Beasain Standard gauge. The Phase-I of Delhi Metro was built for US$2.3 billion and the Phase-II was expected to cost an additional ₹216 billion (US$2.6 billion).[189] Phase-II has a total length of 128 km and was completed by 2010.[190] Delhi Metro completed 10 years of operation on 25 December 2012. It carries millions of passengers every day.[191]\n\n\nAlthough the Delhi Metro was built and is operated by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Limited (DMRC), a state-owned company with equal equity participation of the governments of India and Delhi, it is under the administrative control of the Indian government's Ministry of Urban Development. Besides the construction and operation of the Delhi Metro, DMRC is also involved in the planning and implementation of metro rail, monorail, and high-speed rail projects in India and providing consultancy services to other metro projects in the country as well as abroad.\n\n\n\n### Regional Rapid Transit System[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Namo Bharat trainsets in Duhai\nDelhi is also going to be connected with India's first regional rail metro corridor. The first such system Delhi–Meerut Regional Rapid Transit System was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. This system has the capacity to run at 180KMph.[196]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Ethnic groups in Delhi\n\n![](image)NCT of Delhi population pyramid in 2011\nAccording to the 2011 census of India, the population of the NCT of Delhi is 16,753,235.[197] The corresponding population density was 11,297 persons per km2 with a sex ratio of 866 women per 1000 men, and a literacy rate of 86.34%. In 2004, the birth rate, death rate and infant mortality rate per 1000 population were 20.03, 5.59 and 13.08, respectively.[198] In 2001, the population of Delhi increased by 285,000 as a result of migration and by 215,000 as a result of natural population growth,[198] which made Delhi one of the fastest-growing cities in the world. Dwarka Sub City, Asia's largest planned residential area, is located within the National Capital Territory of Delhi.[199] Urban expansion has resulted in Delhi's urban area now being considered as extending beyond the NCT boundaries to incorporate the towns and cities of neighbouring states including Faridabad and Gurgaon in Haryana, and Ghaziabad and Noida in Uttar Pradesh, the total population of which is estimated by the United Nations to be over 28 million. According to the UN this makes Delhi urban area the world's second-largest urban area after Tokyo,[8] although Demographia declares the Jakarta urban area to be the second-largest.[200] The 2011 census provided two figures for urban area population: 16,314,838 within the NCT boundary,[201] and 21,753,486 for the *Extended Urban Area*.[202] The 2021 regional plan released by the Government of India renamed the *Extended Urban Area* from *Delhi Metropolitan Area (DMA)* as defined by the 2001 plan,[203] to *Central National Capital Region (CNCR)*.[203][204] Around 49% of the population of Delhi lives in slums and unauthorised colonies without any civic amenities.[205] The majority of these slums have inadequate provisions to the basic facilities and according to a DUSIB report, almost 22% of the people do open defecation.[206]\n\n\n\n* ![The Birla temple in Delhi with its towers.](image)\n\nThe Hindu Laxminarayan Mandir was inaugurated by Mahatma Gandhi in 1933.\n* ![The Jama Masjid was built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan between 1650 and 1656.](image)\n\nThe Jama Masjid was built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan between 1650 and 1656.\n* ![The prayer hall of Sikh Gurudwara Sis Ganj Sahib in Chandni Chowk, Old Delhi which dates to 1783](image)\n\nThe prayer hall of Sikh Gurudwara Sis Ganj Sahib in Chandni Chowk, Old Delhi which dates to 1783\n\n\nReligions in Delhi (2011)\n\n\n\nHinduism (81.68%)\nIslam (12.86%)\nSikhism (3.40%)\nJainism (0.99%)\nChristianity (0.87%)\nBuddhism (0.11%)\nOthers (0.09%)\n\nHinduism is Delhi's predominant religious faith, with 81.68% of Delhi's population, followed by Islam (12.86%), Sikhism (3.40%), Jainism (0.99%), Christianity (0.87%), and Buddhism (0.11%).[207] Other minority religions include Zoroastrianism, Baháʼísm and Judaism.[208]\n\n\n\n\n\nReligious groups in Delhi (1891−2011)[e]\n| Religiousgroup\n | 1891[211]: 68 | 1901[212]: 44 | 1911[209]: 20 | 1921[213]: 30 | 1931[214]: 119 | 1941[210]: 80 | 2011[207] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Pop. | % | Pop. | % | Pop. | % | Pop. | % | Pop. | % | Pop. | % | Pop. | % |\n| Hinduism ![](image) | 108,058\n | 56.11%\n | 114,417\n | 54.86%\n | 121,735\n | 52.28%\n | 325,551\n | 66.65%\n | 400,302[f] | 62.92%\n | 567,264[f] | 61.8%\n | 13,712,100\n | 81.68%\n |\n| Islam ![](image) | 79,238\n | 41.15%\n | 88,460\n | 42.41%\n | 102,476\n | 44.01%\n | 141,758\n | 29.02%\n | 206,960\n | 32.53%\n | 304,971\n | 33.22%\n | 2,158,684\n | 12.86%\n |\n| Jainism ![](image) | 3,256\n | 1.69%\n | 3,266\n | 1.57%\n | 3,531\n | 1.52%\n | 4,698\n | 0.96%\n | 5,345\n | 0.84%\n | 11,287\n | 1.23%\n | 166,231\n | 0.99%\n |\n| Christianity ![](image) | 1,700\n | 0.88%\n | 2,164\n | 1.04%\n | 3,075\n | 1.32%\n | 13,320\n | 2.73%\n | 16,989\n | 2.67%\n | 17,475\n | 1.9%\n | 146,093\n | 0.87%\n |\n| Sikhism ![](image) | 289\n | 0.15%\n | 229\n | 0.11%\n | 1,939\n | 0.83%\n | 2,764\n | 0.57%\n | 6,437\n | 1.01%\n | 16,157\n | 1.76%\n | 570,581\n | 3.4%\n |\n| Zoroastrianism ![](image) | 31\n | 0.02%\n | 35\n | 0.02%\n | 74\n | 0.03%\n | 72\n | 0.01%\n | 126\n | 0.02%\n | 284\n | 0.03%\n | —\n | —\n |\n| Judaism ![](image) | 6\n | 0%\n | —\n | —\n | 7\n | 0%\n | 17\n | 0%\n | 11\n | 0%\n | 55\n | 0.01%\n | —\n | —\n |\n| Buddhism ![](image) | 0\n | 0%\n | 0\n | 0%\n | 0\n | 0%\n | 6\n | 0%\n | 76\n | 0.01%\n | 150\n | 0.02%\n | 18,449\n | 0.11%\n |\n| Others\n | 1\n | 0%\n | 4\n | 0%\n | 0\n | 0%\n | 2\n | 0%\n | 0\n | 0%\n | 296\n | 0.03%\n | 15,803\n | 0.09%\n |\n| Total population\n | 192,579\n | 100%\n | 208,575\n | 100%\n | 232,837\n | 100%\n | 488,452\n | 100%\n | 636,246\n | 100%\n | 917,939\n | 100%\n | 16,787,941\n | 100%\n |\n\n\nAccording to the 50th report of the commissioner for linguistic minorities in India, which was submitted in 2014, Hindi is Delhi's most spoken language, with 80.94% speakers, followed by Punjabi (7.14%), Urdu (6.31%) and Bengali (1.50%). 4.11% of Delhites speak other languages.[215] Hindi is also the official language of Delhi while Urdu and Punjabi have been declared as additional official languages.[215]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Culture of India\n\n![](image)\nTraditional pottery on display in *Dilli Haat*\n![](image)\nPragati Maidan hosts the *World Book Fair* biennially.\n\nDelhi's culture has been influenced by its lengthy history and historic association as the capital of India. Although a strong Punjabi Influence can be seen in language, Dress and Cuisine brought by the large number of refugees who came following the partition in 1947 the recent migration from other parts of India has made it a melting pot. This is exemplified by many significant monuments in the city. The Archaeological Survey of India recognises 1,200 heritage buildings[216] and 175 monuments as national heritage sites.[217]\n\n\nIn the Old City, the Mughals and the Turkic rulers constructed several architecturally significant buildings, such as the Jama Masjid—India's largest mosque[218] built in 1656[219] and the Red Fort. Three World Heritage Sites—the Red Fort, Qutub Minar and Humayun's Tomb—are located in Delhi.[220] Other monuments include the India Gate, the Jantar Mantar—an 18th-century astronomical observatory—and the Purana Qila—a 16th-century fortress. The Laxminarayan Temple, Akshardham temple, Gurudwara Bangla Sahib, the Baháʼí Faith's Lotus Temple and the ISKCON temple are examples of modern architecture. Raj Ghat and associated memorials houses memorials of Mahatma Gandhi and other notable personalities. New Delhi houses several government buildings and official residences reminiscent of British colonial architecture, including the Rashtrapati Bhavan, the Secretariat, Rajpath, the Parliament of India and Vijay Chowk. Safdarjung's Tomb is an example of the Mughal gardens style. Some regal *havelis* (palatial residences) are in the Old City.[221] Lotus Temple is a Baháʼí House of Worship completed in 1986. Notable for its flowerlike shape, it serves as the Mother Temple of the Indian subcontinent and has become a prominent attraction in the city. The National Museum and National Gallery of Modern Art are some of the largest museums in the country. Other museums in Delhi include the National Museum of Natural History, National Rail Museum and National Philatelic Museum.\n\n\nChandni Chowk, a 17th-century market, is one of the most popular shopping areas in Delhi for jewellery and *Zari* saris.[222] Delhi's arts and crafts include, *Zardozi*[223]—an embroidery done with gold thread[224]—and *Meenakari*[225]—the art of enamelling.\n\n\n\n### Festivals[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nMore than a quarter of the immigrants in Delhi are from Bihar and neighbouring states. Chhath, a festival of rural Bihar is now popular in Delhi.[226]\n![](image)\nOn Basant Panchmi eve, qawwali singers wearing yellow headbands gather at the dargah of Sufi saint Nizamuddin Auliya to sing verses from Amir Khusrau.[227]\n\nDelhi's association and geographic proximity to the capital, New Delhi, has amplified the importance of national events and holidays like Republic Day, Independence Day (15 August) and *Gandhi Jayanti*. On Independence Day, the Prime Minister addresses the nation from the Red Fort. The Republic Day Parade is a large cultural and military parade showcasing India's cultural diversity and military strength.[228][229] Over the centuries, Delhi has become known for its composite culture, and a festival that symbolises this is the *Phool Walon Ki Sair*, which takes place in September. Flowers and *pankhe*—fans embroidered with flowers—are offered to the shrine of the 13th-century Sufi saint Khwaja Bakhtiyar Kaki and the Yogmaya Temple, both situated in Mehrauli.[230]\n\n\nReligious festivals include *Diwali* (the festival of lights), *Mahavir Jayanti*, Guru Nanak's Birthday, *Raksha Bandhan*, *Durga Puja*, *Holi*, *Lohri*, *Chauth*, *Krishna Janmastami*, *Maha Shivratri*, Eid ul-Fitr, *Moharram* and *Buddha Jayanti*.[229] The Qutub Festival is a cultural event during which performances of musicians and dancers from all over India are showcased at night, with the Qutub Minar as a backdrop.[231] Other events such as Kite Flying Festival, International Mango Festival and *Vasant Panchami* (the Spring Festival) are held every year in Delhi. The Auto Expo, Asia's largest auto show,[232] is held in Delhi biennially. The New Delhi World Book Fair, held biennially at the Pragati Maidan, is the second-largest exhibition of books in the world.[233] Delhi is often regarded as the \"Book Capital\" of India because of high readership.[234] India International Trade Fair (IITF), organised by ITPO is the biggest cultural and shopping fair of Delhi which takes place in November each year and is visited by more than 1.5 million people.[235]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indian cuisine\n\n![](image)Kitchen, Karim's, Old Delhi, a historic restaurant, estab. 1913[236]\nAs India's national capital and centuries old Mughal capital, Delhi influenced the food habits of its residents and is where Mughlai cuisine originated. Along with Indian cuisine, a variety of international cuisines are popular among the residents.[237] The dearth of food habits among the city's residents created a unique style of cooking which became popular throughout the world, with dishes such as *Kebab*, *biryani*, *tandoori*. The city's classic dishes include butter chicken, *dal makhani*, *shahi paneer*, *aloo chaat*, *chaat*, *dahi bhalla*, *kachori*, *gol gappe*, *samosa*, *chole bhature*, *chole kulche*, *gulab jamun*, *jalebi* and *lassi*.[237][238]: 40–50, 189–196\n\n\nThe fast living habits of Delhi's people has motivated the growth of street food outlets.[238]: 41 A trend of dining at local *dhabas* is popular among the residents. High-profile restaurants have gained popularity in recent years, among the popular restaurants are the Karim Hotel, the Punjab Grill and Bukhara.[239] The *Gali Paranthe Wali* (the street of fried bread) is a street in Chandni Chowk particularly for food eateries since the 1870s.

But each time they found the gates locked from the inside. For three days, no help came. ... Since the riots broke out in Delhi at the end of February, the worst religious conflict to engulf the capital in decades, questions have persisted about the role that the Delhi police played in enabling the violence, which was predominately Hindu mobs attacking Muslims. Of the 51 people who died, at least three-quarters were Muslim, and many Muslims are still missing.\n70. **^** Gettleman, Jeffrey; Abi-Habib, Maria (1 March 2020), \"In India, Modi's Policies Have Lit a Fuse\", *The New York Times*, archived from the original on 1 March 2020, retrieved 1 March 2020, This past week, as neighborhoods in India's capital burned and religiously driven bloodletting consumed more than 40 lives, most of them Muslim, India's government was quick to say that the violence was spontaneous ...

Listed by the GaWC as an alpha global city, São Paulo is the most populous city outside of Asia and the world's 4th largest city proper by population. Additionally, São Paulo is the largest Portuguese-speaking city in the world. It exerts strong international influences in commerce, finance, arts and entertainment.[8] The city's name honors the Apostle, Saint Paul of Tarsus. The city's metropolitan area, the Greater São Paulo, ranks as the most populous in Brazil and the 12th most populous on Earth. The process of conurbation between the metropolitan areas around the Greater São Paulo (Campinas, Santos, Jundiaí, Sorocaba and São José dos Campos) created the São Paulo Macrometropolis,[9] a megalopolis with more than 30 million inhabitants, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world.[10]\n\n\nHaving the largest economy by GDP in Latin America,[11] the city is home to the São Paulo Stock Exchange. Paulista Avenue is the economic core of São Paulo. The city has the 23rd largest GDP in the world,[12] representing 10.7% of all Brazilian GDP[13] and 36% of the production of goods and services in the state of São Paulo, being home to 63% of established multinationals in Brazil,[14] and was responsible for 28% of the national scientific production in 2005, as measured by the number of science papers published in journals.[15]\n\n\nThe metropolis is also home to several of the tallest skyscrapers in Brazil, including the Mirante do Vale, Edifício Itália, Banespa, North Tower and many others. The city has cultural, economic and political influence nationally and internationally. It is home to monuments, parks and museums such as the Latin American Memorial, the Ibirapuera Park, Museum of Ipiranga, São Paulo Museum of Art, and the Museum of the Portuguese Language. The city holds events like the São Paulo Jazz Festival, São Paulo Art Biennial, the Brazilian Grand Prix, São Paulo Fashion Week, the ATP Brasil Open, the Brasil Game Show and the Comic Con Experience. São Paulo's LGBT Pride parade ranks second only to the New York City Pride March as the largest LGBT pride parade in the world.[16][17]\n\n\nSão Paulo is a cosmopolitan, melting pot city, home to the largest Arab, Italian, and Japanese diasporas, with examples including ethnic neighborhoods of Bixiga, Bom Retiro, and Liberdade. In 2016, inhabitants of the city were native to over 200 countries.[18] People from the city are known as *paulistanos*, while *paulistas* designates anyone from the state, including the *paulistanos*. The city's Latin motto, which it has shared with the battleship and the aircraft carrier named after it, is *Non ducor, duco*, which translates as \"I am not led, I lead.\"[19] The city, which is also colloquially known as *Sampa*, *Selva de Pedra* (Jungle of Stone)[20] or *Terra da Garoa* (Land of Drizzle), is known for its unreliable weather, the size of its helicopter fleet, its architecture, gastronomy, severe traffic congestion and skyscrapers. São Paulo was one of the host cities of the 1950 and the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Additionally, the city hosted the IV Pan American Games, Miss Universe 2011, and the São Paulo Indy 300.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the city of São Paulo\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of São Paulo.\n\n### Pre-colonial period[edit]\n\n\nHistorical affiliations\n\n\n> \n> ![Portugal](image) Portuguese Empire 1554–1815  \n> ![](image) United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves 1815–1822  \n> ![](image) Empire of Brazil 1822–1889  \n> ![Brazil](image) Republic of Brazil 1889–present\n> \n> \n> \n>\n\nThe region of modern-day São Paulo, then known as Piratininga plains around the Tietê River, was inhabited by the Tupi people, such as the Tupiniquim, Guaianás, and Guarani. Other tribes also lived in areas that today form the metropolitan region.[21]\n\n\nThe region was divided in Caciquedoms (chiefdoms) at the time of encounter with the Europeans.[22] The most notable cacique was Tibiriçá, known for his support for the Portuguese and other European colonists. Among the many indigenous names of places, rivers, neighborhoods, etc., that survive today are Tietê, Ipiranga, Tamanduateí, Anhangabaú, Piratininga, Itaquaquecetuba, Cotia, Itapevi, Barueri, Embu-Guaçu, etc.\n\n\n\n### Colonial period[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Founding of São Paulo*, 1909 painting by Oscar Pereira da Silva\n![](image)Courtyard of the college, *Pátio do Colégio*, in the Historic Center of São Paulo. At this location, the city was founded in 1554. The current building is a reconstruction made in the late 20th century, based on the Jesuit college and church that were erected at the site in 1653.\nThe Portuguese village of São Paulo dos Campos de Piratininga was marked by the founding of the Colégio de São Paulo de Piratininga on 25 January 1554. The Jesuit college of twelve priests included Manuel da Nóbrega and Spanish priest José de Anchieta. They built a mission on top of a steep hill between the Anhangabaú and Tamanduateí rivers.[23]\n\n\nThey first had a small structure built of rammed earth, made by Native Indian workers in their traditional style. The priests wanted to evangelize these Indians who lived in the Plateau region of Piratininga and convert them to Christianity. The site was separated from the coast by the Serra do Mar mountain range, called \"Serra Paranapiacaba\" by the Indians.\n\n\nThe college was named for a Christian saint and its founding on the feast day of the celebration of the conversion of the Apostle Paul of Tarsus. Father José de Anchieta wrote this account in a letter to the Society of Jesus:\n\n\n\n\n> The settlement of the region's Courtyard of the College began in 1560. During the visit of Mem de Sá, Governor-General of Brazil, the Captaincy of São Vicente, he ordered the transfer of the population of the Village of São Bernardo do Campo to the vicinity of the college. It was then named \"College of St. Paul of the Piratininga\". The new location was on a steep hill adjacent to a large wetland, the Várzea do Carmo. It offered better protection from attacks by local Indian groups. It was renamed Vila de São Paulo, belonging to the Captaincy of São Vicente.\n> \n> \n\n\nFor the next two centuries, São Paulo developed as a poor and isolated village that survived largely through the cultivation of subsistence crops by the labor of natives. For a long time, São Paulo was the only village in Brazil's interior, as travel was too difficult for many to reach the area. Mem de Sá forbade colonists to use the Caminho do Piraquê *(Piraquê Path)* and today known as Piaçaguera, because of frequent Indian raids along it.\n\n\nOn 22 March 1681, Luís Álvares de Castro, the Second Marquis de Cascais and donee of the Captaincy of São Vicente, moved the capital to the village of São Paulo *(see Timeline of São Paulo)*, designating it the \"Head of the captaincy\". The new capital was established on 23 April 1683, with public celebrations.\n\n\n\n#### The Bandeirantes[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bandeirantes\n\n![](image)The Monument to the Bandeiras commemorates the 17th-century *bandeiras*.\nIn the 17th century, São Paulo was one of the poorest regions of the Portuguese colony. It was also the center of interior colonial development. Because they were extremely poor, the Paulistas could not afford to buy African slaves, as did other Portuguese colonists. The discovery of gold in the region of Minas Gerais, in the 1690s, brought attention and new settlers to São Paulo. The Captaincy of São Paulo and Minas de Ouro (see Captaincies of Brazil) was created on 3 November 1709, when the Portuguese crown purchased the Captaincies of São Paulo and Santo Amaro from the former grantees.[24]\n\n\nConveniently located in the country, up the steep *Serra do Mar* escarpment/mountain range when traveling from Santos, while also not too far from the coastline, São Paulo became a safe place to stay for tired travelers. The town became a center for the *bandeirantes*, intrepid invaders who marched into unknown lands in search for gold, diamonds, precious stones, and Indians to enslave. The *bandeirantes*, which could be translated as \"flag-bearers\" or \"flag-followers\", organized excursions into the land with the primary purpose of profit and the expansion of territory for the Portuguese crown. Trade grew from the local markets and from providing food and accommodation for explorers. The *bandeirantes* eventually became politically powerful as a group, and forced the expulsion of the Jesuits from the city of São Paulo in 1640. The two groups had frequently come into conflict because of the Jesuits' opposition to the domestic slave trade in Indians.\n\n\n\n![](image)East entrance of the city of São Paulo in 1821, by Arnaud Julien Pallière (1784–1862)\nOn 11 July 1711, the town of São Paulo was elevated to city status. Around the 1720s, gold was found by the pioneers in the regions near what are now Cuiabá and Goiânia. The Portuguese expanded their Brazilian territory beyond the Tordesillas Line to incorporate the gold regions. When the gold ran out in the late 18th century, São Paulo shifted to growing sugar cane. Cultivation of this commodity crop spread through the interior of the Captaincy. The sugar was exported through the Port of Santos. At that time, the first modern highway between São Paulo and the coast was constructed and named the Calçada do Lorena *(\"Lorena's settway\")*. Nowadays, the estate that is home to the Governor of the State of São Paulo, in the city of São Paulo, is called the *Palácio dos Bandeirantes* (Bandeirantes Palace), in the neighborhood of Morumbi.\n\n\n\n### Imperial period[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Empire of Brazil\n\n![](image)Monument to Independence in Independence Park, located at the place where then-Prince Pedro proclaimed the independence of Brazil\n![](image)Cathedral Square of São Paulo in 1880, during the reign of Emperor Pedro II by Marc Ferrez\nAfter Brazil became independent from Portugal in 1822, as declared by Emperor Pedro I where the Monument to the Independence of Brazil is located, he named São Paulo as an Imperial City. In 1827, a law school was founded at the Convent of São Francisco, today part of the University of São Paulo. The influx of students and teachers gave a new impetus to the city's growth, thanks to which the city became the *Imperial City and Borough of Students of St. Paul of Piratininga*.\n\n\nThe expansion of coffee production was a major factor in the growth of São Paulo, as it became the region's chief export crop and yielded good revenue. It was cultivated initially in the Paraíba Valley region in the East of the State of São Paulo, and later on in the regions of Campinas, Rio Claro, São Carlos and Ribeirão Preto.\n\n\nFrom 1869 onward, São Paulo was connected to the port of Santos by the Estrada de Ferro Santos-Jundiaí (Santos-Jundiaí Railroad), nicknamed *The Lady*. In the late 19th century, several other railroads connected the interior to the state capital. São Paulo became the point of convergence of all railroads from the interior of the state. Coffee was the economic engine for major economic and population growth in the State of São Paulo.\n\n\nIn 1888, the \"Golden Law\" (*Lei Áurea*) was sanctioned by Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil, abolishing the institution of slavery in Brazil. Slaves were the main source of labor in the coffee plantations until then. As a consequence of this law, and following governmental stimulus towards the increase of immigration, the province began to receive a large number of immigrants, largely Italians, Japanese and Portuguese peasants, many of whom settled in the capital. The region's first industries also began to emerge, providing jobs to the newcomers, especially those who had to learn Portuguese.\n\n\n\n### Old Republican period[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Luz Station in 1900\nBy the time Brazil became a republic on 15 November 1889, coffee exports were still an important part of São Paulo's economy. São Paulo grew strong in the national political scene, taking turns with the also rich state of Minas Gerais in electing Brazilian presidents, an alliance that became known as \"coffee and milk\", given that Minas Gerais was famous for its dairy production. During this period, São Paulo went from regional center to national metropolis, becoming industrialized and reaching its first million inhabitants in 1928. Its greatest growth in this period was relative in the 1890s when it doubled its population. The height of the coffee period is represented by the construction of the second Luz Station (the present building) at the end of the 19th century and by the Paulista Avenue in 1900, where they built many mansions.[25]\n\n\nIndustrialization was the economic cycle that followed the coffee plantation model. By the hands of some industrious families, including many immigrants of Italian and Jewish origin, factories began to arise and São Paulo became known for its smoky, foggy air. The cultural scene followed modernist and naturalist tendencies in fashion at the beginning of the 20th century. Some examples of notable modernist artists are poets Mário de Andrade and Oswald de Andrade, artists Anita Malfatti, Tarsila do Amaral and Lasar Segall, and sculptor Victor Brecheret. The Modern Art Week of 1922 that took place at the Theatro Municipal was an event marked by avant-garde ideas and works of art. In 1929, São Paulo won its first skyscraper, the Martinelli Building.[25]\n\n\nThe modifications made in the city by Antônio da Silva Prado, Baron of Duprat and Washington Luís, who governed from 1899 to 1919, contributed to the climate development of the city; some scholars consider that the entire city was demolished and rebuilt at that time. São Paulo's main economic activities derive from the services industry – factories are since long gone, and in came financial services institutions, law firms, consulting firms. Old factory buildings and warehouses still dot the landscape in neighborhoods such as Barra Funda and Brás. Some cities around São Paulo, such as Diadema, São Bernardo do Campo, Santo André, and Cubatão are still heavily industrialized to the present day, with factories producing from cosmetics to chemicals to automobiles.\n\n\nIn 1924 the city was the stage of the São Paulo Revolt, an armed conflict fought in working-class neighborhoods near the center of São Paulo that lasted 23 days, from 5 to 28 July, leaving hundreds dead and thousands injured. The confrontation between the federal troops of president Artur Bernardes against rebels of the Brazilian Army and the Public Force of São Paulo was classified by the federal government as a conspiracy, a mutiny and a \"revolt against the Fatherland, without foundation, headed by disorderly members of the Brazilian Army\".[26] To face the rebels, the federal government launched an indiscriminate artillery bombardment against the city, which affected mostly civilian targets; as a result of the bombing, a third of São Paulo's 700,000 inhabitants fled the city. The revolt has been described as \"the largest urban conflict in the history of Brazil\".[27]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nAnhangabaú Valley in Downtown São Paulo, 1925\n\n### Constitutionalist Revolution of 1932[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Constitutionalist Revolution\n\n![](image)Group of aviators from São Paulo at Campo de Marte Airport during the Constitutionalist Revolution\nThis revolution is considered by some historians as the last armed conflict to take place in Brazil's history. On 9 July 1932, the population of São Paulo town rose against a coup d'état by Getúlio Vargas to take the presidential office. The movement grew out of local resentment from the fact that Vargas ruled by decree, unbound by a constitution, in a provisional government. The 1930 coup also affected São Paulo by eroding the autonomy that states enjoyed during the term of the 1891 Constitution and preventing the inauguration of the governor of São Paulo Júlio Prestes in the Presidency of the Republic, while simultaneously overthrowing President Washington Luís, who was governor of São Paulo from 1920 to 1924. These events marked the end of the Old Republic.\n\n\nThe uprising commenced on 9 July 1932, after four protesting students were killed by federal government troops on 23 May 1932. On the wake of their deaths, a movement called MMDC (from the initials of the names of each of the four students killed, Martins, Miragaia, Dráusio and Camargo) started. A fifth victim, Alvarenga, was also shot that night, but died months later. In a few months, the state of São Paulo rebelled against the federal government. Counting on the solidarity of the political elites of two other powerful states, (Minas Gerais and Rio Grande do Sul), the politicians from São Paulo expected a quick war. However, that solidarity was never translated into actual support, and the São Paulo revolt was militarily crushed on 2 October 1932. In total, there were 87 days of fighting (9 July to 4 October 1932 – with the last two days after the surrender of São Paulo), with a balance of 934 official deaths, though non-official estimates report up to 2,200 dead, and many cities in the state of São Paulo suffered damage due to fighting. There is an obelisk in front of Ibirapuera Park that serves as a memorial to the young men that died for the MMDC. The University of São Paulo's Law School also pays homage to the students that died during this period with plaques hung on its arcades.\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jaraguá Peak is the highest point in the city, at 1,135 meters (3,724 ft).[28]\nSão Paulo is the capital of the most populous state in Brazil, São Paulo, located at latitude 23°33'01'' south and longitude 46°38'02'' west. The total area of the municipality is 1,521.11 square kilometres (587.30 sq mi), according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), being the ninth largest in the state in terms of territorial extension.[29] Of the entire area of the municipality, 949,611 square kilometres (366,647 sq mi) are urban areas (2015), being the largest urban area in the country.[30]\n\n\nThe city is on a plateau placed beyond the Serra do Mar (Portuguese for \"Sea Range\" or \"Coastal Range\"), itself a component of the vast region known as the Brazilian Highlands, with an average elevation of around 799 meters (2,621 ft) above sea level, although being at a distance of only about 70 kilometers (43 mi) from the Atlantic Ocean. The distance is covered by two highways, the Anchieta and the Imigrantes, (see \"Transportation\" below) that roll down the range, leading to the port city of Santos and the beach resort of Guarujá. Rolling terrain prevails within the urbanized areas of São Paulo except in its northern area, where the Serra da Cantareira Range reaches a higher elevation and a sizable remnant of the Atlantic Rain Forest. The region is seismically stable and no significant activity has ever been recorded.[31]\n\n\n\n### Hydrography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nTietê River, with the Marginal Tietê\n![](image)\nBillings Reservoir\n\nSee also: Water management in the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo\n\nThe Tietê River and its tributary, the Pinheiros River, were once important sources of fresh water and leisure for São Paulo. However, heavy industrial effluents and wastewater discharges in the later 20th century caused the rivers to become heavily polluted. A substantial clean-up program for both rivers is underway.[32][33] Neither river is navigable in the stretch that flows through the city, although water transportation becomes increasingly important on the Tietê river further downstream (near river Paraná), as the river is part of the River Plate basin.[34]\n\n\nNo large natural lakes exist in the region, but the Billings and Guarapiranga reservoirs in the city's southern outskirts are used for power generation, water storage and leisure activities, such as sailing. The original flora consisted mainly of broadleaf evergreens. Non-native species are common, as the mild climate and abundant rainfall permit a multitude of tropical, subtropical and temperate plants to be cultivated, especially the ubiquitous eucalyptus.[35]\n\n\nThe north of the municipality contains part of the 7,917 hectares (19,560 acres) Cantareira State Park, created in 1962, which protects a large part of the metropolitan São Paulo water supply.[36] In 2015, São Paulo experienced a major drought, which led several cities in the state to start a rationing system.[37]\n\n\n\n### Parks and biodiversity[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nCantareira State Park, part of the São Paulo Green Belt Biosphere Reserve\n![](image)\nSão Paulo Zoo in the Fontes do Ipiranga Biological Reserve\n\nSão Paulo is located in an ecotone area between 3 biomes: mixed ombrophilous forest, dense ombrophilous forest and cerrado; the latter had some plant species native to the pampas in the city. There were several species typical of both biomes, among them we can mention: araucarias, pitangueiras, cambucís, ipês, jabuticabeiras, queen palms, muricís-do-campo, etc.[38]\n\n\nIn 2010, São Paulo had 62 municipal and state parks,[39] such as the Cantareira State Park, part of the São Paulo Green Belt Biosphere Reserve and home to one of the largest urban forests on the planet with 7,900 hectares (20,000 acres) of extension,[40] the Fontes do Ipiranga State Park, the Ibirapuera Park, the Tietê Ecological Park, the Capivari-Monos Environmental Protection Area, the Serra do Mar State Park, Villa-Lobos State Park, People's Park, and the Jaraguá State Park, listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1994.[41]\n\n\nIn 2009, São Paulo had 2,300 hectares (5,700 acres) of green area, less than 1.5% of the city's area[42] and below the 12 square metres (130 sq ft) per inhabitant recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).[43] About 21% of the municipality's area is covered by green areas, including ecological reserves (2010 data).[44][45]\n\n\nIn the municipality it is possible to observe forest birds that usually appear in the spring, due to the belt of native forest that still surrounds the metropolitan region. Species such as the rufous-bellied thrush, golden-chevroned tanager, great kiskadee and hummingbird are the most common. Despite the intense pollution, the main rivers of the city, the Tietê and the Pinheiros, shelter several species of animals such as capybaras, hawks, southern lapwings, herons and nutrias. Other species found in the municipality are the gray brocket, howler monkey, green-billed toucan and the Amazonian umbrellabird.[46]\n\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nTietê River, one of the most polluted in the city\n![](image)\nSmog seen on the horizon of the Ibirapuera region\n\nAir pollution in some districts of the city exceeds local standards, mainly due to car traffic.[47] The World Health Organization (WHO) sets a limit of 20 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter of air as a safe annual average. In an assessment carried out by the WHO among over a thousand cities around the world in 2011, the city of São Paulo was ranked 268th among the most polluted, with an average rate of 38 micrograms per cubic meter, a rate well above the limit imposed by the organization, but lower than in other Brazilian cities, such as Rio de Janeiro (64 micrograms per cubic meter).[48] A 2013 study found that air pollution in the city causes more deaths than traffic accidents.[49][50]\n\n\nThe stretch of the Tietê River that runs through the city is the most polluted river in Brazil.[51] In 1992, the Tietê Project began, with the aim to clean up the river by 2005. 8.8 billion reais was spent on the failed project.[52] In 2019, the Novo Rio Pinheiros Project began, under the administration of João Doria, with the aim to reduce sewage discharged into the Tietê's tributary, the Pinheiros River.[53][54]\n\n\nThe problem of balanced water supply for the city - and for the metropolis, in general - is also a worrying issue: São Paulo has few sources of water in its own perimeter, having to seek it in distant hydrographic basins. The problem of water pollution is also aggravated by the irregular occupation of watershed areas, caused by urban expansion, driven by the difficulty of access to land and housing in central areas by the low-income population[55] and associated with real estate speculation and precariousness in new subdivisions. With this, there is also an overvaluation of individual transport over public transport – leading to the current rate of more than one vehicle for every two inhabitants and aggravating the problem of environmental pollution.[56]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Heavy rain and lightning in São Paulo, which has one of the largest number of lightning incidents amongst Brazilian state capitals[57]\nAccording to the Köppen classification, the city has a humid subtropical climate (*Cfa/Cwa*).[58][59] In summer (January through March), the mean low temperature is about 19 °C (66 °F) and the mean high temperatures is near 28 °C (82 °F). In winter, temperatures tend to range between 12 and 22 °C (54 and 72 °F). The record high temperature was 37.8 °C (100.0 °F) on 17 October 2014[60] and the lowest −3.2 °C (26.2 °F) on 25 June 1918.[61][62] The Tropic of Capricorn, at about 23°27' S, passes through north of São Paulo and roughly marks the boundary between the tropical and temperate areas of South America. Because of its elevation, however, São Paulo experiences a more temperate climate.[63] The city experiences four seasons. The summer is warm and rainy. Autumn and spring are transitional seasons. Winter is the coldest season, with cloudiness around town and frequently polar air masses. Frosts occur sporadically in regions further away from the center, in some winters throughout the city.[64]\n\n\nRainfall is abundant, annually averaging 1,454 millimeters (57.2 in).[65] It is especially common in the warmer months averaging 219 millimeters (8.6 in) and decreases in winter, averaging 47 millimeters (1.9 in). Neither São Paulo nor the nearby coast has ever been hit by a tropical cyclone and tornadic activity is uncommon. During late winter, especially August, the city experiences the phenomenon known as *\"veranico\"* or *\"verãozinho\"* (\"little summer\"), which consists of hot and dry weather, sometimes reaching temperatures well above 28 °C (82 °F). On the other hand, relatively cool days during summer are fairly common when persistent winds blow from the ocean. On such occasions daily high temperatures may not surpass 20 °C (68 °F), accompanied by lows often below 15 °C (59 °F), however, summer can be extremely hot when a heat wave hits the city followed by temperatures around 34 °C (93 °F), but in places with greater skyscraper density and less tree cover, the temperature can feel like 39 °C (102 °F), as on Paulista Avenue for example. In the summer of 2014, São Paulo was affected by a heat wave that lasted for almost 4 weeks with highs above 30 °C (86 °F), peaking on 36 °C (97 °F). Secondary to deforestation, groundwater pollution, and climate change, São Paulo is increasingly susceptible to drought and water shortages.[66]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for São Paulo (Mirante de Santana, 1991–2020, extremes 1887–present)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 37.0(98.6)\n | 35.9(96.6)\n | 34.3(93.7)\n | 33.4(92.1)\n | 31.7(89.1)\n | 28.8(83.8)\n | 30.2(86.4)\n | 33.0(91.4)\n | 35.7(96.3)\n | 35.9(96.6)\n | 35.3(95.5)\n | 35.6(96.1)\n | 37.0(98.6)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 28.6(83.5)\n | 29.0(84.2)\n | 28.0(82.4)\n | 26.6(79.9)\n | 23.4(74.1)\n | 22.9(73.2)\n | 22.9(73.2)\n | 24.5(76.1)\n | 25.2(77.4)\n | 26.5(79.7)\n | 26.9(80.4)\n | 28.3(82.9)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 23.1(73.6)\n | 23.5(74.3)\n | 22.5(72.5)\n | 21.2(70.2)\n | 18.4(65.1)\n | 17.5(63.5)\n | 17.2(63.0)\n | 18.1(64.6)\n | 19.1(66.4)\n | 20.5(68.9)\n | 21.2(70.2)\n | 22.6(72.7)\n | 20.4(68.7)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 19.4(66.9)\n | 19.6(67.3)\n | 18.9(66.0)\n | 17.5(63.5)\n | 14.7(58.5)\n | 13.5(56.3)\n | 12.8(55.0)\n | 13.3(55.9)\n | 14.9(58.8)\n | 16.5(61.7)\n | 17.3(63.1)\n | 18.7(65.7)\n | 16.4(61.5)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | 6.5(43.7)\n | 12.4(54.3)\n | 12.0(53.6)\n | 6.8(44.2)\n | 3.7(38.7)\n | 1.2(34.2)\n | 0.8(33.4)\n | 3.4(38.1)\n | 3.5(38.3)\n | 7.0(44.6)\n | 7.0(44.6)\n | 10.3(50.5)\n | 0.8(33.4)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 292.1(11.50)\n | 257.7(10.15)\n | 229.1(9.02)\n | 87.0(3.43)\n | 66.3(2.61)\n | 59.7(2.35)\n | 48.4(1.91)\n | 32.3(1.27)\n | 83.3(3.28)\n | 127.2(5.01)\n | 143.9(5.67)\n | 231.3(9.11)\n | 1,658.3(65.29)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 1.0 mm) | 17\n | 14\n | 13\n | 6\n | 6\n | 5\n | 4\n | 4\n | 7\n | 10\n | 11\n | 13\n | 110\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 76.9\n | 75.0\n | 76.6\n | 74.6\n | 75.0\n | 73.5\n | 70.8\n | 68.2\n | 71.3\n | 73.7\n | 73.7\n | 73.9\n | 73.6\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 139.1\n | 153.5\n | 161.6\n | 169.3\n | 167.6\n | 160.0\n | 169.0\n | 173.1\n | 144.5\n | 157.9\n | 152.8\n | 145.1\n | 1,893.5\n |\n| Source 1: Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia (sun 1981–2010)[67][68][69][70][71][72][73] |\n| Source 2: Meteo Climat (record highs and lows)[74] |\n\n| Climate data for São Paulo (Horto Florestal, 1961–1990)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 34.6(94.3)\n | 35.8(96.4)\n | 33.4(92.1)\n | 32.0(89.6)\n | 29.5(85.1)\n | 29.4(84.9)\n | 29.0(84.2)\n | 33.2(91.8)\n | 35.2(95.4)\n | 34.3(93.7)\n | 34.6(94.3)\n | 33.9(93.0)\n | 35.8(96.4)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 27.0(80.6)\n | 27.8(82.0)\n | 27.3(81.1)\n | 24.9(76.8)\n | 23.0(73.4)\n | 22.0(71.6)\n | 22.0(71.6)\n | 23.7(74.7)\n | 24.5(76.1)\n | 24.7(76.5)\n | 25.7(78.3)\n | 26.3(79.3)\n | 24.9(76.8)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 21.2(70.2)\n | 21.6(70.9)\n | 21.1(70.0)\n | 18.8(65.8)\n | 16.7(62.1)\n | 15.6(60.1)\n | 15.1(59.2)\n | 16.4(61.5)\n | 17.6(63.7)\n | 18.5(65.3)\n | 19.5(67.1)\n | 20.6(69.1)\n | 18.6(65.4)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 16.6(61.9)\n | 16.9(62.4)\n | 16.3(61.3)\n | 14.1(57.4)\n | 11.7(53.1)\n | 10.5(50.9)\n | 9.7(49.5)\n | 10.9(51.6)\n | 12.4(54.3)\n | 13.7(56.7)\n | 14.6(58.3)\n | 16.0(60.8)\n | 13.6(56.5)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | 10.3(50.5)\n | 11.1(52.0)\n | 9.6(49.3)\n | 3.5(38.3)\n | 0.2(32.4)\n | −1.8(28.8)\n | 0.2(32.4)\n | 0.4(32.7)\n | 3.0(37.4)\n | 5.7(42.3)\n | 7.0(44.6)\n | 9.2(48.6)\n | −1.8(28.8)\n |\n| Average rainfall mm (inches)\n | 245.6(9.67)\n | 243.8(9.60)\n | 159.2(6.27)\n | 76.0(2.99)\n | 59.7(2.35)\n | 58.7(2.31)\n | 53.1(2.09)\n | 39.9(1.57)\n | 76.2(3.00)\n | 162.7(6.41)\n | 195.7(7.70)\n | 220.6(8.69)\n | 1,591.3(62.65)\n |\n| Average rainy days (≥ 1 mm) | 16\n | 14\n | 11\n | 7\n | 6\n | 5\n | 5\n | 4\n | 7\n | 11\n | 12\n | 15\n | 113\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 81.0\n | 80.4\n | 80.3\n | 81.2\n | 80.5\n | 79.2\n | 77.4\n | 74.6\n | 76.2\n | 79.3\n | 79.4\n | 80.4\n | 79.2\n |\n| Source: Brazilian National Institute of Meteorology (INMET).[75][76][77][78][79][80][81][82][83] |\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Brazilians, Demographics of São Paulo, and Demographics of Brazil\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% p.a. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1872 | 31,385 | —     |\n| 1890 | 64,934 | +4.12% |\n| 1900 | 239,820 | +13.96% |\n| 1920 | 579,033 | +4.51% |\n| 1940 | 1,326,261 | +4.23% |\n| 1950 | 2,198,096 | +5.18% |\n| 1960 | 3,781,446 | +5.58% |\n| 1970 | 5,924,615 | +4.59% |\n| 1980 | 8,493,226 | +3.67% |\n| 1991 | 9,646,185 | +1.16% |\n| 2000 | 10,434,252 | +0.88% |\n| 2010 | 11,253,503 | +0.76% |\n| 2021 | 12,396,372 | +0.88% |\n| [84] |\n\n\nSão Paulo's population has grown rapidly. By 1960 it had surpassed that of Rio de Janeiro, making it Brazil's most populous city. By this time, the urbanized area of São Paulo had extended beyond the boundaries of the municipality proper into neighboring municipalities, making it a metropolitan area with a population of 4.6 million. Population growth has continued since 1960, although the rate of growth has slowed.[85]\n\n\nIn 2013, São Paulo was the most populous city in Brazil and in South America.[86] According to the 2010 IBGE Census, there were 11,244,369 people residing in the city of São Paulo.[87] Portuguese remains the most widely spoken language and São Paulo is the largest city in the Portuguese speaking world.[88]\n\n\nIn 2010, the city had 2,146,077 opposite-sex couples and 7,532 same-sex couples. The population of São Paulo was 52.6% female and 47.4% male.[89] The census found 6,824,668 White people (60.6%), 3,433,218 Pardo (multiracial) people (30.5%), 736,083 Black people (6.5%), 246,244 Asian people (2.2%) and 21,318 Amerindian people (0.2%).[89]\n\n\n\n### Immigration and migration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Immigration to Brazil\n\nSão Paulo is considered the most multicultural city in Brazil. From 1870 to 2010, approximately 2.3 million immigrants arrived in the state, from all parts of the world. The Italian community is one of the strongest, with a presence throughout the city. Of the 12 million inhabitants of São Paulo, 50% (6 million people) have full or partial Italian ancestry. São Paulo has more descendants of Italians than any Italian city (the largest city of Italy is Rome, with 2.8 million inhabitants).[90]\n\n\n\n| Race and ethnicity in São Paulo |\n| --- |\n| Ethnicity |  | Percentage |\n| White |  | 60.6% |\n| Pardo (Multiracial) |  | 30.5% |\n| Black |  | 6.5% |\n| Asian |  | 2.2% |\n| Amerindian |  | 0.2% |\n\nThe main groups, considering all the metropolitan area, are: 6 million people of Italian descent,[91] 3 million people of Portuguese descent,[92] 1.7 million people of African descent,[93] 1 million people of Arab descent,[94] 665,000 people of Japanese descent,[94] 400,000 people of German descent,[94] 250,000 people of French descent,[94] 150,000 people of Greek descent,[94] 120,000 people of Chinese descent,[94] 120,000–300,000 Bolivian immigrants,[95] 50,000 people of Korean descent,[96] and 80,000 Jews.[97]\n\n\nEven today, Italians are grouped in neighborhoods like Bixiga, Brás, and Mooca to promote celebrations and festivals. In the early twentieth century, Italian and its dialects were spoken almost as much as Portuguese in the city, which influenced the formation of the São Paulo dialect of today. Six thousand pizzerias are producing about a million pizzas a day. Brazil has the largest Italian population outside Italy, with São Paulo being the most populous city with Italian ancestry in the world.[98]\n\n\nThe Portuguese community is also large; it is estimated that three million paulistanos have some origin in Portugal. The Jewish colony is more than 80,000 people in São Paulo and is concentrated mainly in Higienópolis and Bom Retiro.[99]\n\n\n\n![](image)Italian immigrants in the Immigrant Inn, c. 1890\n![](image)The Liberdade district is a Japantown of São Paulo.\nFrom the nineteenth century through the first half of the twentieth century, São Paulo also received German immigrants (in the current neighborhood of Santo Amaro), Spanish and Lithuanian (in the neighborhood Vila Zelina).[99]\n\n\n\n\n> \"A French observer, travelling to São Paulo at the time, noted that there was a division of the capitalist class, by nationality (...) Germans, French and Italians shared the dry goods sector with Brazilians. Foodstuffs was generally the province of either Portuguese or Brazilians, except for bakery and pastry which was the domain of the French and Germans. Shoes and tinware were mostly controlled by Italians. However, the larger metallurgical plants were in the hands of the English and the Americans. (...) Italians outnumbered Brazilians two to one in São Paulo.\"\n> \n> — [100]\n> \n\n\nUntil 1920, 1,078,437 Italians entered in the State of São Paulo. Of the immigrants who arrived there between 1887 and 1902, 63.5% came from Italy. Between 1888 and 1919, 44.7% of the immigrants were Italians, 19.2% were Spaniards and 15.4% were Portuguese.[101] In 1920, nearly 80% of São Paulo city's population was composed of immigrants and their descendants and Italians made up over half of its male population.[101] At that time, the Governor of São Paulo said that \"if the owner of each house in São Paulo display the flag of the country of origin on the roof, from above São Paulo would look like an Italian city\". In 1900, a columnist who was absent from São Paulo for 20 years wrote \"then São Paulo used to be a genuine Paulista city, today it is an Italian city.\"[101]\n\n\nSão Paulo also is home of the largest Japanese community outside Japan.[102] In 1958 the census counted 120,000 Japanese in the city and by 1987, there were 326,000 with another 170,000 in the surrounding areas within São Paulo state.[103] As of 2007, the Paulistano Japanese population outnumbered their fellow diaspora in the entirety of Peru, and in all individual American cities.[103]\n\n\nResearch conducted by the University of São Paulo (USP) shows the city's high ethnic diversity: when asked if they are \"descendants of foreign immigrants\", 81% of the students reported \"yes\". The main reported ancestries were: Italian (30.5%), Portuguese (23%), Spanish (14%), Japanese (8%), German (6%), *Brazilian* (4%), African (3%), Arab (2%) and Jewish (1%).[104]\n\n\nThe city once attracted numerous immigrants from all over Brazil and even from foreign countries, due to a strong economy and for being the hub of most Brazilian companies.[105] São Paulo is also receiving waves of immigration from Haiti and from many countries of Africa and the Caribbean. Those immigrants are mainly concentrated in Praça da Sé, Glicério and Vale do Anhangabaú in the Central Zone of São Paulo.\n\n\nSince the 19th century people began migrating from northeastern Brazil into São Paulo. This migration grew enormously in the 1930s and remained huge in the next decades. The concentration of land, modernization in rural areas, changes in work relationships and cycles of droughts stimulated migration. Northeastern migrants live mainly in hazardous and unhealthy areas of the city, in cortiços *(\"guettos\")*, in favelas *(\"slums\")* of the metropolis, because they offer cheaper housing. The largest concentration of northeastern migrants was found in the area of Sé/Brás (districts of Brás, Bom Retiro, Cambuci, Pari and Sé). In this area they composed 41% of the population.[106][*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Metropolitan area[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Greater São Paulo and São Paulo Macrometropolis\n\n![](image)Satellite view of Greater São Paulo at night\nThe nonspecific term \"Grande São Paulo\" (\"*Greater São Paulo*\") covers multiple definitions. The legally defined *Região Metropolitana de São Paulo* consists of 39 municipalities in total and a population of 21.1 million[107] inhabitants (as of the 2014 National Census[update]).\n\n\nThe Metropolitan Region of São Paulo is known as the financial, economic, and cultural center of Brazil. Among the largest municipalities, Guarulhos, with a population of more than 1 million people is the biggest one. Several others count more than 100,000 inhabitants, such as São Bernardo do Campo (811,000 inh.) and Santo André (707,000 inh.) in the ABC Region. The ABC Region, comprising Santo André, São Bernardo do Campo and São Caetano do Sul in the south of Grande São Paulo, is an important location for industrial corporations, such as Volkswagen and Ford Motors.[108]\n\n\nBecause São Paulo has urban sprawl, it uses a different definition for its metropolitan area alternately called the Expanded Metropolitan Complex of São Paulo and the São Paulo Macrometropolis. Analogous to the BosWash definition, it is one of the largest urban agglomerations in the world, with 32 million inhabitants,[109] behind Tokyo, which includes four contiguous legally defined metropolitan regions and three micro-regions.\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\n| Religion in São Paulo (2010 Census)[110] |\n| --- |\n| Religion |  | Percent |\n| Roman Catholicism |  | 58.2% |\n| Protestantism |  | 22.1% |\n| No religion |  | 9.38% |\n| Spiritism |  | 4.73% |\n| Others |  | 4.25% |\n| Other Christians |  | 1.33% |\n\nSee also: Religion in Brazil, Protestantism in Brazil, and Roman Catholic Church in Brazil\n\n![](image)\nSão Paulo Metropolitan Cathedral\n![](image)\nOrthodox Cathedral of São Paulo\n![](image)\nTemple of Solomon of the UCKG\n![](image)\nBuddhist Lohan Temple, Liberdade\n![](image)\nBrás mosque\n![](image)\nBeth El Synagogue\n\nLike the cultural variety verifiable in São Paulo, there are several religious manifestations present in the city. Although it has developed on an eminently Catholic social matrix, both due to colonization and immigration – and even today most of the people of São Paulo declare themselves Roman Catholic – it is possible to find in the city dozens of different Protestant denominations, as well as the practice of Islam, Spiritism, among others. Buddhism and Eastern religions also have relevance among the beliefs most practiced by Paulistanos. It is estimated that there are more than one hundred thousand Buddhist followers and Hindu. Also considerable are Judaism, Mormonism and Afro-Brazilian religions.[110]\n\n\nAccording to data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), in 2010 the population of São Paulo was 6,549,775 Roman Catholics (58.2%), 2,887,810 Protestants (22.1%), 531,822 Spiritists (4.7%), 101,493 Jehovah's Witnesses (0.9%), 75,075 Buddhists (0.7%), 50,794 Umbandists (0.5%), 43,610 Jews (0.4%), 28,673 Catholic Apostolic Brazilians (0.3%), 25,583 eastern religious (0.2%), 18,058 Candomblecists (0.2%), 17,321 Mormons (0.2%), 14,894 Eastern Orthodox (0.1%), 9,119 spiritualists (0.1%), 8,277 Muslims (0.1%), 7,139 esoteric (0.1%), 1,829 practiced Indian traditions (<0.1%) and 1,008 were Hindu (<0.1%). Others 1,056 008 had no religion (9.4%), 149,628 followed other Christian religiosities (1.3%), 55,978 had an undetermined religion or multiple belonging (0.5%), 14,127 did not know (0.1%) And 1,896 reported following other religiosities (<0.1%).[110]\n\n\nThe Catholic Church divides the territory of the municipality of São Paulo into four ecclesiastical circumscriptions: the Archdiocese of São Paulo, and the adjacent Diocese of Santo Amaro, the Diocese of São Miguel Paulista and the Diocese of Campo Limpo, the last three suffragans of the first. The archive of the archdiocese, called the Metropolitan Archival Dom Duarte Leopoldo e Silva, in the Ipiranga neighborhood, holds one of the most important documentary heritage in Brazil. The archiepiscopal is the Metropolitan Cathedral of São Paulo (known as Sé Cathedral), in Praça da Sé, considered one of the five largest Gothic temples in the world. The Catholic Church recognizes as patron saints of the city Saint Paul of Tarsus and Our Lady of Penha of France.[111]\n\n\nThe city has the most diverse Protestant or Reformed creeds, such as the Evangelical Community of Our Land, Maranatha Christian Church, Lutheran Church, Presbyterian Church, Methodist Church, Anglican Episcopal Church, Baptist churches, Assembly Church of God, The Seventh-day Adventist Church, the World Church of God's Power, the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, the Christian Congregation in Brazil, among others, as well as Christians of various denominations.[111] \n\n\n\n### Public security[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Training of soldiers of the Military Police of São Paulo State at the Military Police Academy of Barro Branco\nAccording to the 2011 Global Homicide Survey released by the United Nations, in the period between 2004 and 2009 the homicide rate dropped from 20.8 to 10.8 murders per 100,000 inhabitants. The UN pointed to São Paulo as an example of how big cities can reduce crime. Crime rates, such as homicide, have been steadily declining for 8 years. The number of murders in 2007 was 63% lower than in 1999. Carandiru's 9th DP is considered one of the five best police stations in the world and the best in Latin America.\n\n\nIn 2008, the city of São Paulo ranked 493rd in the list of the most violent cities in Brazil. Among the capitals, it was the fourth least violent, registering, in 2006, homicide rates higher than those of Boa Vista, Palmas and Natal.\n\n\nIn a survey on the Adolescent Homicide Index (IHA), released in 2009, São Paulo ranked 151st among 267 cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants. In November 2009, the Ministry of Justice and the Brazilian Forum of Public Security published a survey that pointed to São Paulo as the safest Brazilian capital for young people. Between 2000 and 2010, the city of São Paulo reduced its homicide rate by 78%. According to data from the Map of Violence 2011, published by the Sangari Institute and the Ministry of Justice, the city of São Paulo has the lowest homicide rate per 100,000 inhabitants among all Brazilian capitals.\n\n\n\n### Social challenges[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Social issues in Brazil\n\n![](image)Paraisópolis, the largest slum (*favela*) in the city, with residential buildings in the background\n![](image)Public housing in Heliópolis\nSince the beginning of the 20th century, São Paulo has been a major economic center in Latin America. During two World Wars and the Great Depression, coffee exports (from other regions of the state) were critically affected. This led wealthy coffee farmers to invest in industrial activities that turned São Paulo into Brazil's largest industrial hub.\n\n\n\n* Crime rates consistently decreased in the 21st century. The citywide homicide rate was 6.56 in 2019, less than a fourth of the 27.38 national rate.[112]\n* Air quality[47] has steadily increased during the modern era.\n* The two major rivers crossing the city, Tietê and Pinheiros, are highly polluted. A major project to clean up these rivers is underway.[32][33]\n* The Clean City Law or antibillboard, approved in 2007, focused on two main targets: anti-publicity and anti-commerce. Advertisers estimate that they removed 15,000 billboards and that more than 1,600 signs and 1,300 towering metal panels were dismantled by authorities.[113]\n* São Paulo metropolitan region, adopted vehicle restrictions from 1996 to 1998 to reduce air pollution during wintertime. Since 1997, a similar project was implemented throughout the year in the central area of São Paulo to improve traffic.[114]\n* There were more than 30,000 homeless people in 2021 according to official data. It increased by 31% in two years, and doubled in 20 years.[115]\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Brazil\n\nThe primary language is Portuguese. The general language from São Paulo General, or Tupi Austral (Southern Tupi), was the Tupi-based trade language of what is now São Vicente, São Paulo, and the upper Tietê River. In the 17th century it was widely spoken in São Paulo and spread to neighboring regions while in Brazil. From 1750 on, following orders from Marquess of Pombal, Portuguese language was introduced through immigration and consequently taught to children in schools. The original Tupi Austral language subsequently lost ground to Portuguese, and eventually became extinct. Due to the large influx of Japanese, German, Spanish, Italian and Arab immigrants etc., the Portuguese idiom spoken in the metropolitan area of São Paulo reflects influences from those languages.\n\n\n\n![](image)Museum of the Portuguese Language\nThe Italian influence in São Paulo accents is evident in the Italian neighborhoods such as Bela Vista, Mooca, Brás and Lapa. Italian mingled with Portuguese and as an old influence, was assimilated or disappeared into spoken language. The local accent with Italian influences became notorious through the songs of Adoniran Barbosa, a Brazilian samba singer born to Italian parents who used to sing using the local accent.[116]\n\n\nOther languages spoken in the city are mainly among the Asian community: São Paulo is home to the largest Japanese population outside Japan. Although today most Japanese-Brazilians speak only Portuguese, some of them are still fluent in Japanese. Some people of Chinese and Korean descent are still able to speak their ancestral languages.[117] In some areas it is still possible to find descendants of immigrants who speak German[118] (especially in the area of Brooklin paulista) and Lithuanian or Russian or East European languages (especially in the area of Vila Zelina).[119][12] In the west zone of São Paulo, specially at Vila Anastácio and Lapa region, there is a Hungarian colony, with three churches (Calvinist, Baptist and Catholic), so on Sundays it is possible to see Hungarians talking to each other on sidewalks.\n\n\n\n### Sexual diversity[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: LGBT rights in Brazil, LGBT people in Brazil, LGBT history in Brazil, and Same-sex marriage in Brazil\n\n![](image)The 18th edition of the São Paulo Gay Pride Parade in 2014\nThe Greater São Paulo is home to a prominent self-identifying gay, bisexual and transgender community, with 9.6% of the male population and 7% of the female population declaring themselves to be non-heterosexual.[120] Same-sex civil unions have been legal in the whole country since 5 May 2011, while same-sex marriage in São Paulo was legalized on 18 December 2012. Since 1997, the city has hosted the annual São Paulo Gay Pride Parade, considered the biggest pride parade in the world by the Guinness Book of World Records with over 5 million participants, and typically rivalling the New York City Pride March for the record.[16]\n\n\nStrongly supported by the State and the City of São Paulo government authorities, in 2010, the city hall of São Paulo invested R$1 million reais in the parade and provided a solid security plan, with approximately 2,000 policemen, two mobile police stations for immediate reporting of occurrences, 30 equipped ambulances, 55 nurses, 46 medical physicians, three hospital camps with 80 beds. The parade, considered the city's second largest event after the Formula One, begins at the São Paulo Museum of Art, crosses Paulista Avenue, and follows Consolação Street to Praça Roosevelt in Downtown São Paulo. According to the LGBT app Grindr, the gay parade of the city was elected the best in the world.[121]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Education in Brazil and Brazilian science and technology\n\n![](image)University of São Paulo\nSão Paulo has public and private primary and secondary schools and vocational-technical schools. More than nine-tenths of the population are literate and roughly the same proportion of those age 7 to 14 are enrolled in school. There are 578 universities in the state of São Paulo.[122]\n\n\nThe city of São Paulo is also home to research and development facilities and attracts companies due to the presence of regionally renowned universities. Science, technology and innovation is leveraged by the allocation of funds from the state government, mainly carried out by means of the Foundation to Research Support in the State of São Paulo (Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo – FAPESP), one of the main agencies promoting scientific and technological research.[123]\n\n\n\n### Health care[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Health in Brazil\n\nSee also: Rede São Paulo Saudável\n\n![](image)Institute of Cancer of São Paulo, the largest oncology center in Latin America[124][125]\nSão Paulo is one of the largest health care hubs in Latin America. Among its hospitals are the Albert Einstein Israelites Hospital, ranked the best hospital in all Latin America[126] and the Hospital das Clínicas, the largest in the region, with a total area of 600,000 square meters and offers 2,400 beds, distributed among its eight specialized institutes and two assisting hospitals.[127]\n\n\nThe main hospitals in the city of São Paulo concentrate in the upper-income areas, the majority of the population of the city has a private health insurance. This can includes hospitals, private practices and pharmacies. The city of São Paulo has the largest number of foreigners comparing with any other Brazilian city and an intense health tourism. In Brazil, the city of São Paulo has the largest number of doctors who can speak more than one language, which in this case is Portuguese, with the secondary languages predominantly are English and Spanish.[128]\n\n\nThe private health care sector is very large and most of Brazil's best hospitals are in the city. As of September 2009, the city of São Paulo had: 32,553 ambulatory clinics, centers and professional offices (physicians, dentists and others); 217 hospitals, with 32,554 beds; 137,745 health care professionals, including 28,316 physicians.[129]\n\n\nThe municipal government operates public health facilities across the city's territory, with 770 primary health care units (UBS), ambulatory and emergency clinics and 17 hospitals. The Municipal Secretary of Health has 59,000 employees, including 8,000 physicians and 12,000 nurses. 6,000,000 citizens uses the facilities, which provide drugs at no cost and manage an extensive family health program (PSF – Programa de Saúde da Família).[130]\n\n\nThe Sistema Integrado de Gestão de Assistência à Saúde de São Paulo – SIGA Saúde (*Integrated Health Care Management System in São Paulo*) has been operating in the city of São Paulo since 2004. Today there are more than 22 million registered users, including the people of the Greater São Paulo, with a monthly average of 1.3 million appointments.[130]\n\n\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of mayors of São Paulo\n\n![](image)Matarazzo Building, the São Paulo city hall\n![](image)Municipal Chamber of São Paulo\n![](image)Bandeirantes Palace, the seat of state government\nAs the capital of the state of São Paulo, the city is home to the Bandeirantes Palace (state government) and the Legislative Assembly. The Executive Branch of the municipality of São Paulo is represented by the mayor and his cabinet of secretaries, following the model proposed by the Federal Constitution.[131] The organic law of the municipality and the Master Plan of the city, however, determine that the public administration must guarantee to the population effective tools of manifestation of participatory democracy, which causes that the city is divided in regional prefectures, each one led by a Regional Mayor appointed by the Mayor.[132]\n\n\nThe legislative power is represented by the Municipal Chamber, composed of 55 aldermen elected to four-year posts (in compliance with the provisions of Article 29 of the Constitution, which dictates a minimum number of 42 and a maximum of 55 for municipalities with more than five million inhabitants). It is up to the house to draft and vote fundamental laws for the administration and the Executive, especially the municipal budget (known as the Law of Budgetary Guidelines).[133] In addition to the legislative process and the work of the secretariats, there are also a number of municipal councils, each dealing with different topics, composed of representatives of the various sectors of organized civil society. The actual performance and representativeness of such councils, however, are sometimes questioned.\n\n\nThe following municipal councils are active: Municipal Council for Children and Adolescents (CMDCA); of Informatics (WCC); of the Physically Disabled (CMDP); of Education (CME); of Housing (CMH); of Environment (CADES); of Health (CMS); of Tourism (COMTUR); of Human Rights (CMDH); of Culture (CMC); and of Social Assistance (COMAS) and Drugs and Alcohol (COMUDA). The Prefecture also owns (or is the majority partner in their social capital) a series of companies responsible for various aspects of public services and the economy of São Paulo:\n\n\n\n* *São Paulo Turismo S/A* (SPTuris): company responsible for organizing large events and promoting the city's tourism.\n* *Companhia de Engenharia de Tráfego* (CET):[134] subordinated to the Municipal Transportation Department, is responsible for traffic supervision, fines (in cooperation with DETRAN) and maintenance of the city's road system.\n* *Companhia Metropolitana de Habitação de São Paulo* (COHAB): subordinate to the Department of Housing, is responsible for the implementation of public housing policies, especially the construction of housing developments.\n* *Empresa Municipal de Urbanização de São Paulo* (EMURB): subordinate to the Planning Department, is responsible for urban works and for the maintenance of public spaces and urban furniture.\n* *Companhia de Processamento de Dados de São Paulo* (PRODAM): responsible for the electronic infrastructure and information technology of the city hall.\n* *São Paulo Transportes Sociedade Anônima* (SPTrans): responsible for the operation of the public transport systems managed by the city hall, such as the municipal bus lines.\n\n\n### Subdivisions[edit]\n\n\nSão Paulo is divided into 32 subprefectures, each with an administration (\"subprefeitura\") divided into several districts (\"distritos\").[132] The city also has a radial division into nine zones for purpose of traffic control and bus lines, which do not fit into the administrative divisions. These zones are identified by colors in the street signs. The historical core of São Paulo, which includes the inner city and the area of Paulista Avenue, is in the Subprefecture of Sé. Most other economic and tourist facilities of the city are inside an area officially called *Centro Expandido* (Portuguese for \"Broad Center\", or \"Broad Downtown\"), which includes Sé and several other subprefectures, and areas immediately around it.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Subprefectures of São Paulo[135] |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Subprefecture\n | Area\n | Population\n |  |  | Subprefecture\n | Area\n | Population\n |\n| 1\n | **Aricanduva/Vila Formosa** | 21.5 km2 | 266 838\n | ![](image) | 17\n | **Mooca** | 35.2 km2 | 305 436\n |\n| 2\n | **Butantã** | 56.1 km2 | 345 943\n | 18\n | **Parelheiros** | 353.5 km2 | 110 909\n |\n| 3\n | **Campo Limpo** | 36.7 km2 | 508 607\n | 19\n | **Penha** | 42.8 km2 | 472 247\n |\n| 4\n | **Capela do Socorro** | 134.2 km2 | 561 071\n | 20\n | **Perus** | 57.2 km2 | 109 218\n |\n| 5\n | **Casa Verde/Cachoeirinha** | 26.7 km2 | 313 176\n | 21\n | **Pinheiros** | 31.7 km2 | 270 798\n |\n| 6\n | **Cidade Ademar** | 30.7 km2 | 370 759\n | 22\n | **Pirituba/Jaraguá** | 54.7 km2 | 390 083\n |\n| 7\n | **Cidade Tiradentes** | 15 km2 | 248 762\n | 23\n | **Sé** | 26.2 km2 | 373 160\n |\n| 8\n | **Ermelino Matarazzo** | 15.1 km2 | 204 315\n | 24\n | **Santana/Tucuruvi** | 34.7 km2 | 327 279\n |\n| 9\n | **Freguesia do Ó/Brasilândia** | 31.5 km2 | 391 403\n | 25\n | **Jaçanã/Tremembé** | 64.1 km2 | 255 435\n |\n| 10\n | **Guaianases** | 17.8 km2 | 283 162\n | 26\n | **Santo Amaro** | 37.5 km2 | 217 280\n |\n| 11\n | **Ipiranga** | 37.5 km2 | 427 585\n | 27\n | **São Mateus** | 45.8 km2 | 422 199\n |\n| 12\n | **Itaim Paulista** | 21.7 km2 | 358 888\n | 28\n | **São Miguel Paulista** | 24.3 km2 | 377 540\n |\n| 13\n | **Itaquera** | 54.3 km2 | 488 327\n | 29\n | **Sapopemba** | 13.4 km2 | 296 042\n |\n| 14\n | **Jabaquara** | 14.1 km2 | 214 200\n | 30\n | **Vila Maria/Vila Guilherme** | 26.4 km2 | 302 899\n |\n| 15\n | **Lapa** | 40.1 km2 | 270 102\n | 31\n | **Vila Mariana** | 26.5 km2 | 311 019\n |\n| 16\n | **M'Boi Mirim** | 62.1 km2 | 523 138\n | 32\n | **Vila Prudente** | 33.3 km2 | 480 823\n |\n\n\n### International relations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of twin towns and sister cities in Brazil\n\nSão Paulo is twinned with:[136]\n\n\n\n* ![Ivory Coast](image) Abidjan, Ivory Coast\n* ![Paraguay](image) Asunción, Paraguay\n* ![Spain](image) Barcelona, Spain\n* ![Portugal](image) Belmonte, Portugal\n* ![Romania](image) Cluj-Napoca, Romania\n* ![Cuba](image) Havana, Cuba\n* ![Turkey](image) İzmir, Turkey\n* ![Peru](image) Lima, Peru\n* ![Macau](image) Macau, China\n* ![United States](image) Miami-Dade County, United States\n* ![Italy](image) Milan, Italy\n* ![Japan](image) Osaka, Japan\n* ![Bolivia](image) La Paz, Bolivia\n* ![Spain](image) San Cristóbal de La Laguna, Spain\n* ![Chile](image) Santiago, Chile\n* ![Spain](image) Santiago de Compostela, Spain\n* ![South Korea](image) Seoul, South Korea\n* ![China](image) Shanghai, China\n* ![Armenia](image) Yerevan, Armenia\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Economy of São Paulo, Economy of the state of São Paulo, and Economy of Brazil\n\n![](image)\nB3, the largest stock exchange of Latin America by market capitalization\n![](image)\nPaulista Avenue, the headquarters of many financial and cultural institutions\n![](image)\nPeople's Park in Itaim Bibi, in the region of the Brigadeiro Faria Lima Avenue\n![](image)\nUnited Nations Business Center at Brooklin Novo\n![](image)\nOscar Freire St., one of the most luxurious streets in the world[137]\n\nSão Paulo is considered the \"financial capital of Brazil\", as it is the location for the headquarters of major corporations and of banks and financial institutions. São Paulo is Brazil's highest GDP city and one of the largest in the world,[138][139]\n\n\nAccording to data from the IBGE, its gross domestic product (GDP) in 2010 was R$450 billion,[140] approximately\nUS$220 billion, 12.26% of Brazilian GDP and 36% of all production of goods and services of the State of São Paulo.[141]\n\n\nAccording to PricewaterhouseCoopers average annual economic growth of the city is 4.2%.[142] São Paulo also has a large \"informal\" economy.[143] In 2005, the city of São Paulo collected R$90 billion in taxes and the city budget was R$15 billion. The city has 1,500 bank branches and 70 shopping malls.[144]\n\n\nAs of 2014[update], São Paulo is the third largest exporting municipality in Brazil after Parauapebas, PA and Rio de Janeiro, RJ. In that year São Paulo's exported goods totaled $7.32B (USD) or 3.02% of Brazil's total exports. The top five commodities exported by São Paulo are soybean (21%), raw sugar (19%), coffee (6.5%), sulfate chemical wood pulp (5.6%), and corn (4.4%).[145]\n\n\nThe São Paulo Stock Exchange (BM&F Bovespa) is Brazil's official stock and bond exchange. It is the largest stock exchange in Latin America, trading about R$6 billion (US$3.5 billion) every day.[146]\n\n\nSão Paulo's economy is going through a deep transformation. Once a city with a strong industrial character, São Paulo's economy has followed the global trend of shifting to the tertiary sector of the economy, focusing on services. The city is unique among Brazilian cities for its large number of foreign corporations.[147]\n\n\n63% of all the international companies with business in Brazil have their head offices in São Paulo. São Paulo has one of the largest concentrations of German businesses worldwide[148] and is the largest Swedish industrial hub alongside Gothenburg.[149]\n\n\nSão Paulo ranked second after New York in FDi magazine's bi-annual ranking of Cities of the Future 2013–14 in the Americas, and was named the Latin American City of the Future 2013–14, overtaking Santiago de Chile, the first city in the previous ranking. Santiago now ranks second, followed by Rio de Janeiro.[150]\n\n\nThe per capita income for the city was R$32,493 in 2008.[151] According to Mercer's 2011 city rankings of cost of living for expatriate employees, São Paulo is now among the ten most expensive cities in the world, ranking 10th in 2011, up from 21st in 2010 and ahead of London, Paris, Milan and New York City.[152][153]\n\n\nLuxury brands tend to concentrate their business in São Paulo. Because of the lack of department stores and multi-brand boutiques, shopping malls as well as the Jardins district attract most of the world's luxurious brands. Most of the international luxury brands can be found in the Iguatemi, Cidade Jardim or JK shopping malls or on the streets of Oscar Freire, Lorena or Haddock Lobo in the Jardins district. They are home of brands such as Cartier, Chanel, Dior, Giorgio Armani, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs, Tiffany & Co. Cidade Jardim was opened in São Paulo in 2008, it is a 45,000-square-meter (484,376-square-foot) mall, landscaped with trees and greenery scenario, with a focus on Brazilian brands but also home to international luxury brands such as Hermès, Jimmy Choo, Pucci and Carolina Herrera. Opened in 2012, JK shopping mall has brought to Brazil brands that were not present in the country before such as Goyard, Tory Burch, Llc., Prada, and Miu Miu.[154]\n\n\nThe Iguatemi Faria Lima, in Faria Lima Avenue, is Brazil's oldest mall, opened in 1966.[155] The Jardins neighborhood is regarded among the most sophisticated places in town, with upscale restaurants and hotels. The New York Times once compared Oscar Freire Street to Rodeo Drive.[156] In Jardins there are luxury car dealers. One of the world's best restaurants as elected by The World's 50 Best Restaurants Award, D.O.M.,[157] is there.\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tourism in the city of São Paulo\n\n![](image)\nIbirapuera Park, elected the best in South America by TripAdvisor[158]\n![](image)\nRoda Rico, the tallest observation wheel in Latin America[159]\n\nLarge hotel chains whose target audience is the corporate traveler are in the city. São Paulo is home to 75% of the country's leading business fairs. The city also promotes one of the most important fashion weeks in the world, São Paulo Fashion Week, established in 1996 under the name Morumbi Fashion Brasil, is the largest and most important fashion event in Latin America.[160] Besides, the São Paulo Gay Pride Parade, held since 1997 on Paulista Avenue is the event that attracts more tourists to the city.[161]\n\n\nThe annual March For Jesus is a large gathering of Christians from Protestant churches throughout Brazil, with São Paulo police reporting participation in the range of 350,000 in 2015.[162] In addition, São Paulo hosts the annual São Paulo Pancake Cook-Off in which chefs from across Brazil and the world participate in competitions based on the cooking of pancakes.[163]\n\n\nCultural tourism also has relevance to the city, especially when considering the international events in the metropolis, such as the São Paulo Art Biennial, that attracted almost 1 million people in 2004.\n\n\nThe city has a nightlife that is considered one of the best in the country, and is an international hub of highly active and diverse nightlife with bars, dance bars and nightclubs staying open well past midnight.[164] There are cinemas, theaters, museums, and cultural centers. The Rua Oscar Freire was named one of the eight most luxurious streets in the world, according to the Mystery Shopping International,[165] and São Paulo the 25th \"most expensive city\" of the planet.[166]\n\n\nAccording to the International Congress & Convention Association, São Paulo ranks first among the cities that host international events in Americas and the 12th in the world, after Vienna, Paris, Barcelona, Singapore, Berlin, Budapest, Amsterdam, Stockholm, Seoul, Lisbon, and Copenhagen.[167] According to a study by MasterCard in 130 cities around the world, São Paulo was the third most visited destination in Latin America (behind Mexico City and Buenos Aires) with 2.4 million foreign travelers, who spent US$2.9 billion in 2013 (the highest among the cities in the region). In 2014, CNN ranked nightlife São Paulo as the fourth best in the world, behind New York City, Berlin and Ibiza, in Spain.[168]\n\n\nThe cuisine of the region is a tourist attraction. The city has 62 cuisines across 12,000 restaurants.[169] During the 10th International Congress of Gastronomy, Hospitality and Tourism (Cihat) conducted in 1997, the city received the title of \"World Gastronomy Capital\" from a commission formed by 43 nations' representatives.[170]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nPanoramic view of the city at night from Ibirapuera Park\n\n## Urban infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Octávio Frias de Oliveira Bridge aside of *Centro Empresarial Nações Unidas*\nSince the beginning of the 20th century, São Paulo has been one of the main economic centers of Latin America. With the First and Second World Wars and the Great Depression, coffee exports to the United States and Europe were heavily affected, forcing the rich coffee growers to invest in the industrial activities that would make São Paulo the largest industrial center in Brazil. The new job vacancies contributed to attract a significant number of immigrants (mainly from Italy)[171] and migrants, especially from the Northeastern states.[172] From a population of only 32.000 people in 1880, São Paulo now had 8.5 million inhabitants in 1980. The rapid population growth has brought many problems for the city.\n\n\nSão Paulo is practically all served by the water supply network. The city consumes an average of 221 liters of water/inhabitant/day while the UN recommends the consumption of 110 liters/day. The water loss is 30.8%. However, between 11 and 12.8% of households do not have a sewage system, depositing waste in pits and ditches. Sixty percent of the sewage collected is treated. According to data from IBGE and Eletropaulo, the electricity grid serves almost 100% of households. The fixed telephony network is still precarious, with coverage of 67.2%. Household garbage collection covers all regions of the municipality but is still insufficient, reaching around 94% of the demand in districts such as Parelheiros and Perus. About 80% of the garbage produced daily by Paulistas is exported to other cities, such as Caieiras and Guarulhos.[173] Recycling accounts for about 1% of the 15,000 metric tons of waste produced daily.[173]\n\n\n\n### Urban planning[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Changes in urban fabrics in the region of Jardins: side by side, vertical areas and low houses\n![](image)Martinelli Building was the first skyscraper of Latin America and the tallest until 1947.\n![](image)The city view from Altino Arantes Building\n![](image)Pinheiros River in Santo Amaro district\nSão Paulo has a myriad of urban fabrics. The original nuclei of the city are vertical, characterized by the presence of commercial buildings and services; And the peripheries are generally developed with two to four-story buildings – although such generalization certainly meets with exceptions in the fabric of the metropolis. Compared to other global cities (such as the island cities of New York City and Hong Kong), however, São Paulo is considered a \"low-rise building\" city. Its tallest buildings rarely reach forty stories, and the average residential building is twenty. Nevertheless, it is the fourth city in the world in quantity of buildings, according to the page specialized in research of data on buildings *Emporis Buildings*,[174] besides possessing what was considered until 2014 the tallest skyscraper of the country, the Mirante do Vale, also known as *Palácio Zarzur Kogan*, with 170 meters of height and 51 floors.[175]\n\n\nSuch tissue heterogeneity, however, is not as predictable as the generic model can make us imagine. Some central regions of the city began to concentrate indigents, drug trafficking, street vending and prostitution, which encouraged the creation of new socio-economic centralities. The characterization of each region of the city also underwent several changes throughout the 20th century. With the relocation of industries to other cities or states, several areas that once housed factory sheds have become commercial or even residential areas.[176]\n\n\nSão Paulo has a history of actions, projects and plans related to urban planning that can be traced to the governments of Antonio da Silva Prado, Baron Duprat, Washington and Luis Francisco Prestes Maia. However, in general, the city was formed during the 20th century, growing from village to metropolis through a series of informal processes and irregular urban sprawl.[177]\n\n\nUrban growth in São Paulo has followed three patterns since the beginning of the 20th century, according to urban historians: since the late 19th century and until the 1940s, São Paulo was a condensed city in which different social groups lived in a small urban zone separated by type of housing; from the 1940s to the 1980s, São Paulo followed a model of center-periphery social segregation, in which the upper and middle-classes occupied central and modern areas while the poor moved towards precarious, self-built housing in the periphery; and from the 1980s onward, new transformations have brought the social classes closer together in spatial terms, but separated by walls and security technologies that seek to isolate the richer classes in the name of security.[178] Thus, São Paulo differs considerably from other Brazilian cities such as Belo Horizonte and Goiânia, whose initial expansion followed determinations by a plan, or a city like Brasília, whose master plan had been fully developed prior to construction.[179]\n\n\nThe effectiveness of these plans has been seen by some planners and historians as questionable. Some of these scholars argue that such plans were produced exclusively for the benefit of the wealthier strata of the population while the working classes would be relegated to the traditional informal processes. In São Paulo until the mid-1950s, the plans were based on the idea of \"demolish and rebuild\", including former Mayor Francisco Prestes Maia's road plan for São Paulo (known as the Avenues Plan) or Saturnino de Brito's plan for the Tietê River. The Plan of the Avenues was implemented during the 1920s and sought to build large avenues connecting the city center with the outskirts. This plan included renewing the commercial city center, leading to real estate speculation and gentrification of several downtown neighborhoods. The plan also led to the expansion of bus services, which would soon replace the trolley as the preliminary transportation system.[180] This contributed to the outwards expansion of São Paulo and the peripherization of poorer residents. Peripheral neighborhoods were usually unregulated and consisted mainly of self-built single-family houses.[178]\n\n\nIn 1968 the Urban Development Plan proposed the Basic Plan for Integrated Development of São Paulo, under the administration of Figueiredo Ferraz. The main result was zoning laws. It lasted until 2004 when the Basic Plan was replaced by the current Master Plan.[181] That zoning, adopted in 1972, designated \"Z1\" areas (residential areas designed for elites) and \"Z3\" (a \"mixed zone\" lacking clear definitions about their characteristics). Zoning encouraged the growth of suburbs with minimal control and major speculation.[182] After the 1970s peripheral lot regulation increased and infrastructure in the periphery improved, driving land prices up. The poorest and the newcomers now could not purchase their lot and build their house, and were forced to look for a housing alternative. As a result, favelas and precarious tenements (cortiços) appeared.[183] These housing types were often closer to the city's center: favelas could sprawl in any unused terrain (often dangerous or unsanitary) and decaying or abandoned buildings for tenements were abundant inside the city. Favelas went back into the urban perimeter, occupying the small lots not yet occupied by urbanization – alongside polluted rivers, railways, or between bridges.[184] By 1993, 19.8% of São Paulo's population lived in favelas, compared to 5.2% in 1980.[185] Today, it is estimated that 2.1 million Paulistas live in favelas, which represents about 11% of the metropolitan area's population.[186]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nPanoramic view of Central Zone of São Paulo from Italy Building\n\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Transport in São Paulo and Transport in Brazil\n\n#### Roads[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nBandeirantes Highway/SP-348\n![](image)\nMario Covas Beltway\n\nAutomobiles are the main means to get into the city. In March 2011, more than 7 million vehicles were registered.[187] Heavy traffic is common on the city's main avenues and traffic jams are relatively common on its highways.\n\n\nThe city is crossed by 10 major motorways: President Dutra Highway/BR-116 (connects São Paulo to the east and north-east of the country); Régis Bittencourt Highway/BR-116 (connects São Paulo to the south of the country); Fernão Dias Highway/BR-381 (connects São Paulo to the north of the country); Anchieta Highway/SP-150 (connects São Paulo to the ocean coast); Immigrants Highway/SP-150 (connects São Paulo to the ocean coast); President Castelo Branco Highway/SP-280 (connects São Paulo to the west and north-west of the country); Raposo Tavares Highway/SP-270 (connects São Paulo to the west of the country); Anhanguera Highway/SP-330 (connects São Paulo to the north-west of the country, including its capital city); Bandeirantes Highway/SP-348 (connects São Paulo to the north-west of the country); Ayrton Senna Highway/SP-70 (named after Brazilian legendary Formula One driver Ayrton Senna, the motorway connects São Paulo to east locations of the state, as well as the north coast of the state).\n\n\nThe Rodoanel Mário Covas (official designation SP-021) is the beltway of the Greater São Paulo. Upon its completion, it will have a length of 177 km (110 mi), with a radius of approximately 23 km (14 mi) from the geographical center of the city. It was named after Mário Covas, who was mayor of the city of São Paulo (1983–1985) and a state governor (1994-1998/1998-2001) until his death from cancer. It is a controlled access highway with a speed limit of 100 km/h (62 mph) under normal weather and traffic circumstances. The west, south and east parts are completed, and the north part, which will close the beltway, is due in 2022 and is being built by DERSA.[188]\n\n\n\n#### Airports[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nSão Paulo–Congonhas Airport\n![](image)\nSão Paulo/Guarulhos International Airport\n\nSão Paulo has two main airports, São Paulo/Guarulhos International Airport for international flights and national hub, and São Paulo–Congonhas Airport for domestic and regional flights. Another airport, the Campo de Marte Airport, serves private jets and light aircraft. The three airports together moved more than 58.000.000 passengers in 2015, making São Paulo one of the top 15 busiest in the world, by number of air passenger movements. The region of Greater São Paulo is also served by Viracopos International Airport, São José dos Campos Airport and Jundiaí Airport.\n\n\nCongonhas Airport operates flights mainly to Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre, Belo Horizonte and Brasília. Built in the 1930s, it was designed to handle the increasing demand for flights, in the fastest growing city in the world. Located in Campo Belo District, Congonhas Airport is close to the three main city's financial districts: Paulista Avenue, Brigadeiro Faria Lima Avenue and Engenheiro Luís Carlos Berrini Avenue.\n\n\nThe São Paulo–Guarulhos International, also known as \"Cumbica\", is 25 km (16 mi) north-east of the city center, in the neighboring city of Guarulhos. Every day nearly 110.000 people pass through the airport, which connects Brazil to 36 countries around the world. 370 companies operate there, generating more than 53.000 jobs. The international airport is connected to the metropolitan rail system, with Line 13 (CPTM).\n\n\nCampo de Marte is in Santana district, the northern zone of São Paulo. The airport handles private flights and air shuttles, including air taxi firms. Opened in 1935, Campo de Marte is the base for the largest helicopter fleet in Brazil and the world's, ahead of New York and Tokyo.[189] This airport is the home base of the State Civil Police Air Tactical Unit, the State Military Police Radio Patrol Unit and the São Paulo Flying Club.[190]\nFrom this airport, passengers can take advantage of some 350 remote helipads and heliports to bypass heavy road traffic.[191]\n\n\n\n#### Urban rail[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nMap of the 377 km (234 mi) urban rail network of the city (São Paulo Metro and CPTM)\n![](image)\nMonorail of the Line 15 (Silver) of the São Paulo Metro\n![](image)\nTrain of the Line 4 (Yellow) of the São Paulo Metro\n![](image)\nTrain of the CPTM at Luz Station\n\nMain articles: São Paulo Metro and Companhia Paulista de Trens Metropolitanos\n\nSão Paulo has an urban rail transit system (São Paulo Metro and CPTM) that serves 184 stations and has 377 km (234 mi) of track,[192] forming the largest metropolitan rail transport network of Latin America.[193] The underground and urban railway lines together carry some 7 million people on an average weekday.[194]\n\n\nThe São Paulo Metro operates 104 kilometers (65 mi) of rapid transit system, with six lines in operation, serving 91 stations.[195] In 2015, the metro reached the mark of 11.5 million passengers per mile of line, 15% higher than in 2008, when 10 million users were taken per mile. It is the largest concentration of people in a single transport system in the world, according to the company. In 2014, the São Paulo Metro was elected the best metro system in the Americas.[196]\n\n\nThe company ViaQuatro, a private concessionaire, operates the Line 4 of the metro system.[197] The Line 15 (Silver) is the first mass-transit monorail of the South America and the first system in the world to use the Bombardier Innovia Monorail 300. When fully completed will be the largest and highest capacity monorail system in the Americas and second worldwide, only behind to the Chongqing Monorail.[198]\n\n\nThe Companhia Paulista de Trens Metropolitanos (CPTM, or \"Paulista Company of Metropolitan Trains\") railway add 273.0 km (169.6 mi) of commuter rail, with seven lines and 94 stations. The system carries about 2.8 million passengers a day. On 8 June 2018, CPTM set a weekday ridership record with 3,096,035 trips.[199] The Line 13 (Jade) of the CPTM connects São Paulo to the São Paulo–Guarulhos International Airport, in the municipality of Guarulhos, the first major international airport in South America to be directly served by train.[200]\n\n\nCCR Group (through the ViaQuatro and ViaMobilidade concessionaires) operates subway lines 4–Yellow and 5–Lilac, in addition to managing (through the ViaMobilidade concessionaire) lines 8-Diamond and 9-Emerald of the metropolitan train system. Metro and metropolitan train networks transport an average of nearly 7 million people a day, while another 2 million passengers are transported by EMTU buses daily.[201]\n\n\nThe two major São Paulo railway stations are Luz and Júlio Prestes in the Luz/Campos Eliseos region. Julio Prestes Station connected Southwest São Paulo State and Northern Paraná State to São Paulo City. Agricultural products were transferred to Luz Station from which they headed to the Atlantic Ocean and overseas. Júlio Prestes stopped transporting passengers through the Sorocabana or FEPASA lines and now only has metro service. Due to its acoustics and interior beauty, surrounded by Greek revival columns, part of the rebuilt station was transformed into the São Paulo Hall.\n\n\nLuz Station was built in Britain and assembled in Brazil. It has an underground station and is still active with metro lines that link São Paulo to the Greater São Paulo region to the East and the Campinas Metropolitan region in Jundiaí in the western part of the State. Luz Station is surrounded by important cultural institutions such as the Pinacoteca do Estado, The Museu de Arte Sacra on Tiradentes Avenue and Jardim da Luz, among others. It is the seat of the Santos-Jundiaí line which historically transported international immigrants from the Port of Santos to São Paulo and the coffee plantation lands in the Western region of Campinas. São Paulo has no tram lines, although trams were common in the first half of the 20th century.[202]\n\n\n\n#### Buses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nSão Paulo has two independent trolleybus systems.[203]\n![](image)\nTietê Bus Terminal, the 2nd busiest bus terminal in the world, after PABT[204]\n\nMain articles: SPTrans, Empresa Metropolitana de Transportes Urbanos de São Paulo, and Trolleybuses in São Paulo\n\nBus transport (government and private) is composed of 17,000 buses (including about 290 trolley buses).[205] The traditional system of informal transport (dab vans) was later reorganized and legalized. The trolleybus systems provide a portion of the public transport service in Greater São Paulo with two independent netwoeks.[206][203] The SPTrans (São Paulo Transportes) system opened in 1949 and serves the city of São Paulo, while the Empresa Metropolitana de Transportes Urbanos de São Paulo (EMTU) system opened in 1988 and serves suburban areas to the southeast of the city proper. Worldwide, São Paulo is one of only two metropolitan areas possessing two independent trolleybus systems, the other being Naples, Italy.[203]\n\n\nSão Paulo Tietê Bus Terminal is the second largest bus terminal in the world, after PABT in New York.[204] It serves localities across the nation, with the exception of the states of Amazonas, Roraima and Amapá. Routes to 1,010 cities in five countries (Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay and Paraguay) are available. It connects to all regional airports and a ride sharing automobile service to Santos.[204]\n\n\nThe Palmeiras-Barra Funda Intermodal Terminal is much smaller and is connected to the Palmeiras-Barra Funda metro and Palmeiras-Barra Funda CPTM stations. It serves the southwestern cities of Sorocaba, Itapetininga, Itu, Botucatu, Bauru, Marília, Jaú, Avaré, Piraju, Santa Cruz do Rio Pardo, Ipaussu, Chavantes and Ourinhos (on the border with Paraná State). It also serves São José do Rio Preto, Araçatuba and other small towns on the northwest of São Paulo State.\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of Brazil\n\n![](image)Sala São Paulo, the home of the São Paulo State Symphony\nAdoniran Barbosa was a samba singer and composer who became successful during São Paulo's early radio era. Born in 1912 in the town of Valinhos, Barbosa was known as the \"composer to the masses\", particularly Italian immigrants living in the quarters of Bela Vista, also known as \"Bexiga\" and Brás, as well as those who lived in the city's many 'cortiços' or tenements. His songs drew from the life of urban workers, the unemployed and those who lived on the edge. His first big hit was \"Saudosa Maloca\" (\"Shanty of Fond Memories\" – 1951), wherein three homeless friends recall with nostalgia their improvised shanty home, which was torn down by the landowner to make room for a building. His 1964 Trem das Onze (\"The 11 pm Train\"), became one of the five best samba songs ever, the protagonist explains to his lover that he cannot stay any longer because he has to catch the last train to the Jaçanã suburb, for his mother will not sleep before he arrives home. Another important musician with a similar style is Paulo Vanzolini. Vanzolini is a PhD in biology and a part-time professional musician. He composed a song depicting a love murder scene in São Paulo called \"Ronda\".\n\n\n\n![](image)Ibirapuera Auditorium\n![](image)Titãs live at the Montevideo Rock 2018\nIn the late 1960s, a psychedelic rock band called Os Mutantes became popular. Their success is related to that of other tropicalia musicians. The group was known as very *paulistanos* in its behavior and clothing. Os Mutantes released five albums before lead singer Rita Lee departed in 1972 to join another group called Tutti Frutti. Although initially known only in Brazil, Os Mutantes became successful abroad after the 1990s. In 2000, *Tecnicolor*, an album recorded in the early 1970s in English by the band, was released with artwork designed by Sean Lennon.[207]\n\n\nIn the early 1980s, a band called *Ultraje a Rigor* (Elegant Outrage) emerged. They played a simple and irreverent style of rock. The lyrics depicted the changes in society and culture that Brazilian society was experiencing. A late punk and garage scene became strong in the 1980s, perhaps associated with the gloomy scenario of unemployment during an extended recession. Bands originating from this movement include Ira!, Titãs, Ratos de Porão and Inocentes. In the 1990s, drum and bass arose as another musical movement in São Paulo, with artists such as DJ Marky, DJ Patife, XRS, Drumagick and Fernanda Porto.[208] Many heavy metal bands also originated in São Paulo, such as Angra, Project46, Torture Squad, Korzus and Dr. Sin. Famous electro-pop band Cansei de Ser Sexy, or CSS (Portuguese for \"tired of being sexy\") also has its origins in the city.\n\n\nMany of the most important classical Brazilian living composers, such as Amaral Vieira, Osvaldo Lacerda and Edson Zampronha, were born and live in São Paulo. Local baritone Paulo Szot has won international acclaim performing for six consecutive seasons at The Metropolitan Opera, La Scala and Opera de Paris, among others; and The Tony Award for best actor in a musical for his performance in a 2008 revival of *South Pacific*. The São Paulo State Symphony is one of the world's outstanding orchestras; their artistic director beginning in 2012 is the noted American conductor Marin Alsop. In 1952, Heitor Villa-Lobos wrote his Symphony Number 10 ('Ameríndia') for the 400th anniversary of São Paulo: an allegorical, historical and religious account of the city told through the eyes of its founder José de Anchieta.[209]\n\n\nSão Paulo's opera houses are: São Paulo Municipal Theater, Theatro São Pedro and Alfa Theater, for the symphonic concerts there is the Sala São Paulo, the latter being the headquarters of OSESP, an orchestra. The city hosts several music halls. The main ones are: Citibank Hall, HSBC Music Hall, Olympia, Via Funchal, Villa Country, Arena Anhembi and Espaco das Américas. The Anhembi Sambadrome hosts musical presentations as well, in addition to the Carnival of São Paulo. Other facilities include the new Praça das Artes, with the Municipal Conservatory of Music Chamber Hall and others venues, like, Cultura Artistica, Teatro Sérgio Cardoso with a venue for only dance performances and Herzog & DeMeron's Centro Cultural Luz, for Ballet, Opera, theater and concerts, with three huge halls. The auditorium of the Latin-American Cultural Center, The Mozarteum, holds concerts through the year. Festivals as the Virada Cultural (Cultural Overnight) happen once a year and holds hundreds of attractions spread throughout the city.\n\n\n\n![](image)\n2007 Virada Cultural, in Downtown São Paulo\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Literature of Brazil\n\n![](image)Mário de Andrade Library\n![](image)Livraria Cultura\nSão Paulo was home to the first Jesuit missionaries in Brazil, in the early 16th century. They wrote reports to the Portuguese crown about the newly found land, the native peoples and composed poetry and music for the catechism, creating the first written works from the area. The literary priests included Manuel da Nóbrega and José de Anchieta, living in or near the colony then called *Piratininga*. They also helped to register the Old Tupi language, lexicon and its grammar.\nIn 1922, the Brazilian Modernist Movement, launched in São Paulo, began to achieve cultural independence. Brazil had gone through the same stages of development as the rest of Latin America, but its political and cultural independence came more gradually.[210]\n\n\nBrazilian elite culture was originally strongly tied to Portugal. Gradually writers developed a multi-ethnic body of work that was distinctively Brazilian. The presence of large numbers of former slaves added a distinctive African character to the culture. Subsequent infusions of immigrants of non-Portuguese origin broadened the range of influences.[211]\n\n\nMário de Andrade and Oswald de Andrade were the prototypical modernists. With the urban poems of \"Paulicéia Desvairada\" and \"Carefree Paulistan land\" (1922), Mário de Andrade established the movement in Brazil. His rhapsodic novel *Macunaíma* (1928), with its abundance of Brazilian folklore, represents the apex of modernism's nationalist prose through its creation of an offbeat native national hero. Oswald de Andrade's experimental poetry, avant-garde prose, particularly the novel Serafim Ponte Grande (1933) and provocative manifestos exemplify the movement's break with tradition.[211]\n\n\nModernist artists and writers chose the Municipal Theatre of São Paulo to launch their Modernist manifesto. The site happened to be a bastion of European culture with opera and classical music presentations from Germany, France, Austria and Italy. They defied the high society that frequented the venue and who insisted on speaking only foreign languages such as French, behaving as if Brazilian culture did not matter.[211]\n\n\n\n### Theaters[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Municipal Theatre of São Paulo\nMany historians believe that the first theatrical performance in Brazil was held in São Paulo. The Portuguese Jesuit missionary José de Anchieta (1534–1597) wrote short plays that were performed and watched by the Tupi–Guarani natives. In the second half of the 19th century a cultural, musical and theatrical life emerged. European ethnic groups began holding performances in some of the state's rural cities. The most important period for the art in São Paulo was the 1940s. São Paulo had had a professional company, Teatro Brasileiro de Comédia, (Brazilian Theater of Comedy), along with others.\n\n\nDuring the 1960s, major theater productions in São Paulo and Brazil were presented by two groups. Teatro de Arena began with a group of students from Escola de Arte Dramática (Drama Art School), founded by Alfredo Mesquita, in 1948. In 1958, the group excelled with the play \"Eles não usam black tie\" by Gianfrancesco Guarnieri which was the first in the history of the Brazilian drama to feature labor workers as protagonists.[212]\n\n\nAfter the military coup of 1964, plays started focusing on Brazilian history (Zumbi, Tiradentes). Teatro de Arena and Teatro Oficina supported the democratic resistance during the military dictatorship period, marked by its censorship. The Tropicalist movement began there. A number of plays represented historic moments, notably \"O Rei da Vela\", \"Galileu Galilei\" (1968), \"Na Selva das Cidades\" (1969) and \"Gracias Señor\" (1972).\n\n\nThe district of Bixiga concentrates the greatest number of theaters, around 40 including the theaters that are closed for refurbishing or for other reasons, and small alternatives companies venues. Some of the most important are Renault, Brigadeiro, Zaccaro, Bibi Ferreira, Maria della Costa, Ruth Escobar, Opera, TBC, Imprensa, Oficina, Àgora, Cacilda Becker, Sérgio Cardoso, do Bixiga, and Bandeirantes.\n\n\n\n### Museums[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nSão Paulo Museum of Art\n![](image)\nPinacotheca of the State of São Paulo\n![](image)\nIpiranga Museum\n![](image)\nLatin America Memorial\n![](image)\nSão Paulo Museum of Image and Sound\n![](image)\nFootball Museum at Pacaembu Stadium\n![](image)\nItaú Cultural\n\nSão Paulo has many neighborhoods and buildings of historical value.

Immigrant's Hostel was built in Brás to welcome the immigrants who arrived in Brazil through the Port of Santos, quarantining those who were sick and helping new arrivals to find work in coffee plantations in Western, Northern and Southwestern São Paulo State and Northern Paraná State. From 1882 to 1978, 2.5 million immigrants of more than 60 nationalities and ethnicities were guests there,[214] all of them duly registered in the museum's books and lists. The hostel hosted approximately 3,000 people on average, but occasionally reached 8,000. The hostel received the last immigrants in 1978.[215]\n\n\nIn 1998 the hostel became a museum, where it preserves the immigrants' documentation, memory and objects. Located in one of the few remaining centenarian buildings, the museum occupies part of the former hostel. The museum also restores wooden train wagons from the former São Paulo Railway. Two restored wagons inhabit the museum. One dates from 1914, while a second class passenger car dates from 1931. The museum records the names of all immigrants who were hosted there from 1888 to 1978.[216]\n\n\nMASP has one of world's most important collections of European art. The most important collections cover Italian and French painting schools. The museum was founded by Assis Chateaubriand and is directed by Pietro Maria Bardi. Its headquarters, opened in 1968, were designed by Lina Bo Bardi. MASP organizes temporary exhibitions in special areas. Brazilian and international exhibitions of contemporary arts, photography, design and architecture take turn during the whole year.[217]\n\n\nLocated next to the Luz metro station, the Pinacoteca do Estado de São Paulo was projected by architect Ramos de Azevedo in 1895. It was constructed to house an Arts Lyceum. In 1911, it became a museum, where it hosts a number of art exhibitions, such as bronze statues of French sculptor Auguste Rodin took place in 2001. There is also a permanent exhibition on the \"Resistance\" movement that took place during military dictatorship in the Republican period, including a reconstructed prison cell where political prisoners were kept.\n\n\nThe Oca (*oca* means thatched house in Native Brazilian Tupi-Guarani) is a white, spaceship-like building sitting in the greens of Ibirapuera Park. An exhibition place with more than 10 thousand square meters (0.11 million square feet). Modern art, Native Brazilian art, and photographie are some of the topics of past thematic exhibitions.\n\n\nMuseu da Imagem e do Som (*Image and Sound Museum*) preserves music, cinema, photography and graphical arts.

Tokyo serves as Japan's economic center and the seat of both the Japanese government and the Emperor of Japan.\n\n\nPrior to the 17th century, Tokyo was predominantly a fishing village and was named Edo. In 1603, however, the city ascended to political prominence after being named the seat of the Tokugawa shogunate. By the mid-18th century, Edo emerged as one of the world's most-populous cities with a population of over one million people. Following the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the imperial capital in Kyoto was moved to Edo, and the city was renamed Tokyo (lit. 'Eastern Capital'). In 1923, Tokyo was damaged substantially by the Great Kanttō earthquake and was later decimated by allied bombing raids during World War II in retailiation for Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. \n\n\nSince 1943, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government has administered the prefecture's special wards, including Tokyo City), various commuter towns and suburbs in its western area, and two outlying island chains known as the Tokyo Islands.\n\n\nBeginning in the mid-20th century, Tokyo underwent rapid reconstruction and expansion that contributed to the era's so-called Japanese economic miracle in which Japan's economy propelled to the second-largest in the world behind the United States.[10]\n\n\nTokyo, which is categorized as an Alpha+ city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network, is Japan's leading business hub and part of an industrial region that includes Yokohama, Kawasaki, and Chiba. As of 2023[update], the city is home to 29 of the world's largest 500 companies listed in the annual *Fortune* Global 500.[11]\n\n\nIn 2020, Tokyo ranked fourth on the Global Financial Centres Index behind New York City, London, and Shanghai.[12] The city is home to the world's tallest tower, Tokyo Skytree,[13] and the world's largest underground floodwater diversion facility, the Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel in Kasukabe, Saitama, a Tokyo suburb.[14] The Tokyo Metro Ginza Line, which opened in 1927, is the oldest underground metro line in East Asia.[15] Tokyo is recognized as one of the world's most livable cities; it was ranked fourth in the world in Global Livability Ranking, published in 2021.[16]\n\n\nIn the 20th and 21st centuries, Tokyo has hosted several major international events, including the 1964 Summer Olympics and 1964 Summer Paralympics, the 2020 Summer Olympics, and three G7 summits in 1979, 1986, and 1993. Tokyo is an international research and development hub and an academic center with several major universities, including the University of Tokyo. Tokyo Station is the central hub for the Shinkansen, Japan's high-speed railway network, and Shinjuku Station in Tokyo is the world's busiest train station. Notable special wards in Tokyo include Chiyoda, the site of the National Diet Building and the Tokyo Imperial Palace, Shinjuku, the city's administrative center, and Shibuya, a commercial, cultural, and business hub in the city.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Tokyo |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| ![](image)*Tōkyō* in *kanji*\n |\n| Japanese name |\n| Kanji | 東京 |\n| Hiragana | とうきょう |\n| Katakana | トウキョウ |\n| Kyūjitai | 東亰 |\n| \n\n| Transcriptions |\n| --- |\n| Romanization | Tōkyō |\n| Revised Hepburn | Toukyou |\n\n |\n|  |\n\n\n Tokyo was originally known as Edo (江戸), a kanji compound of 江 (*e*, \"cove, inlet\") and 戸 (*to*, \"entrance, gate, door\").[17] The name, which can be translated as \"estuary\", is a reference to the original settlement's location at the meeting of the Sumida River and Tokyo Bay. During the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the name of the city was changed to Tokyo (東京, from 東 *tō* \"east\", and 京 *kyō* \"capital\"), when it became the new imperial capital,[18] in line with the East Asian tradition of including the word capital (京) in the name of the capital city (for example, Kyoto (京都), Keijō (京城), Beijing (北京), Nanjing (南京), and Xijing (西京)).[17] During the early Meiji period, the city was sometimes called \"Tōkei\", an alternative pronunciation for the same characters representing \"Tokyo\", making it a kanji homograph. Some surviving official English documents use the spelling \"Tokei\";[19] however, this pronunciation is now obsolete.[20]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Tokyo\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Tokyo.\n\n### Pre-1869 (Edo period)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Edo\n\nSee also: Perry Expedition and Bakumatsu\n\nTokyo was originally a village called Edo, in what was formerly part of the old Musashi Province. Edo was first fortified by the Edo clan, in the late twelfth century. In 1457, Ōta Dōkan built Edo Castle. In 1590, Tokugawa Ieyasu moved from Mikawa Province (his lifelong base) to the Kantō region. When he became *shōgun* in 1603, Edo became the center of his ruling. During the subsequent Edo period, Edo grew into one of the largest cities in the world with a population topping one million by the 18th century.[21]\n\n\nEdo was still the home of the Tokugawa shogunate and not the capital of Japan (the Emperor himself lived in Kyoto almost continuously from 794 to 1868).[22] During the Edo era, the city enjoyed a prolonged period of peace known as the *Pax Tokugawa*, and in the presence of such peace, the shogunate adopted a stringent policy of seclusion, which helped to perpetuate the lack of any serious military threat to the city.[23] The absence of war-inflicted devastation allowed Edo to devote the majority of its resources to rebuilding in the wake of the consistent fires, earthquakes, and other devastating natural disasters that plagued the city.\n\n\nThis prolonged period of seclusion however came to an end with the arrival of American Commodore Matthew C. Perry in 1853. Commodore Perry forced the opening of the ports of Shimoda and Hakodate, leading to an increase in the demand for new foreign goods and subsequently a severe rise in inflation.[24] Social unrest mounted in the wake of these higher prices and culminated in widespread rebellions and demonstrations, especially in the form of the \"smashing\" of rice establishments.[25] Meanwhile, supporters of the Emperor leveraged the disruption that these widespread rebellious demonstrations were causing to further consolidate power by overthrowing the last Tokugawa *shōgun*, Yoshinobu, in 1867.[26] After 265 years, the *Pax Tokugawa* came to an end.\n\n\n\n* Gallery\n* ![Edo Castle, 17th century](image)\n\nEdo Castle, 17th century\n* ![Commodore Matthew Perry expedition and his first arrival in Japan in 1853](image)\n\nCommodore Matthew Perry expedition and his first arrival in Japan in 1853\n* ![Famous Edo Places.

The young Emperor Meiji visited once at the end of that year and eventually moved in in 1869. Tokyo was already the nation's political center,[27] and the emperor's residence made it a de facto imperial capital as well, with the former Edo Castle becoming the Imperial Palace. The city of Tokyo was officially established on May 1, 1889.\n\n\nThe Tokyo Metro Ginza Line portion between Ueno and Asakusa was the first subway line built in Japan and East Asia completed on December 30, 1927.[15] Central Tokyo, like Osaka, has been designed since about 1900 to be centered on major railway stations in a high-density fashion, so suburban railways were built relatively cheaply at street level and with their own right-of-way. Though expressways have been built in Tokyo, the basic design has not changed.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nTokyo went on to suffer two major catastrophes in the 20th century: the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, which left 140,000 dead or missing; and World War II.[28]\n\n\n\n* Gallery\n* ![An aerial view of the Sumida River with Taitō-ku (west) and Sumida-ku (east) in Tokyo, c. 1930](image)\n\nAn aerial view of the Sumida River with Taitō-ku (west) and Sumida-ku (east) in Tokyo, c. 1930\n* ![Nihonbashi after Great Kanto Earthquake, 1 September 1923](image)\n\nNihonbashi after Great Kanto Earthquake, 1 September 1923\n* ![The Ginza area in 1933](image)\n\nThe Ginza area in 1933\n* ![\"The first underground railway in the Orient\", Tokyo Underground, opened on 30 December 1927](image)\n\n\"The first underground railway in the Orient\", Tokyo Underground, opened on 30 December 1927\n\n\n### 1943–1945[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bombing of Tokyo\n\nIn 1943, the city of Tokyo merged with the prefecture of Tokyo to form the \"Metropolitan Prefecture\" of Tokyo. Since then, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government served as both the prefecture government for Tokyo, as well as administering the special wards of Tokyo, for what had previously been Tokyo City. World War II wreaked widespread destruction of most of the city due to the persistent Allied air raids on Japan and the use of incendiary bombs. The bombing of Tokyo in 1944 and 1945 is estimated to have killed between 75,000 and 200,000 civilians and left more than half of the city destroyed.[29]\n\n\nThe deadliest night of the war came on March 9-10, 1945, the night of the American \"Operation Meetinghouse\" raid;[30] as nearly 700,000 incendiary bombs rained on the eastern half of the city, mainly in heavily residential wards. Two-fifths of the city were completely burned, more than 276,000 buildings were demolished, 100,000 civilians were killed, and 110,000 more were injured.[31][32] Between 1940 and 1945, the population of Japan's capital city dwindled from 6,700,000 to less than 2,800,000, with the majority of those who lost their homes living in \"ramshackle, makeshift huts\".[33]\n\n\n\n* Gallery\n* ![The bombing of Tokyo in 1945](image)\n\nThe bombing of Tokyo in 1945\n* ![The aftermath of the bombing of Tokyo, March 1945](image)\n\nThe aftermath of the bombing of Tokyo, March 1945\n* ![Nihonbashi in 1946](image)\n\nNihonbashi in 1946\n\n\n### 1945–present[edit]\n\n\nAfter the war, Tokyo became the base from which the United States under Douglas MacArthur administered Japan for six years. Tokyo struggled to rebuild as occupation authorities stepped in and drastically cut back on Japanese government rebuilding programs, focusing instead on simply improving roads and transportation. Tokyo did not experience fast economic growth until the 1950s.[34]\n\n\nAfter the occupation of Japan ended in 1952, Tokyo was completely rebuilt and was showcased to the world during the 1964 Summer Olympics, such as the Yoyogi National Gymnasium and the 0 Series Shinkansen, the first bullet train of its class in the world. The 1970s and the 1980s brought new high-rise developments. In 1978, Sunshine 60 – the tallest skyscraper in Asia until 1985, and in Japan until 1991[35] – and Narita International Airport were constructed, and the population increased to about 11 million in the metropolitan area.[36] The Edo-Tokyo Open Air Architectural Museum has historic Japanese buildings that existed in the urban landscape of pre-war Tokyo.\n\n\nTokyo's subway and commuter rail network became one of the busiest in the world[37] as more and more people moved to the area. In the 1980s, real estate prices skyrocketed during a real estate and debt bubble. The bubble burst in the early 1990s, and many companies, banks, and individuals were caught with mortgage-backed debts while real estate was shrinking in value. A major recession followed, making the 1990s Japan's \"Lost Decade\",[38] from which it is now slowly recovering.\n\n\nTokyo still sees new urban developments on large lots of less profitable land. Recent projects include Ebisu Garden Place, Tennōzu Isle, Shiodome, Roppongi Hills, Shinagawa (Shinagawa Station, a major hub for Shinkansen), and the Marunouchi side of Tokyo Station. Buildings of significance have been demolished for more up-to-date shopping facilities such as Omotesando Hills.[39]\n\n\nLand reclamation projects in Tokyo have also been going on for centuries. The most prominent is the Odaiba area, now a major shopping and entertainment center. Various plans have been proposed[40] for transferring national government functions from Tokyo to secondary capitals in other regions of Japan, to slow down rapid development in Tokyo and revitalize economically lagging areas of the country. These plans have been controversial[41] within Japan and have yet to be realized.\n\n\nThe 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami that devastated much of the northeastern coast of Honshu was felt in Tokyo. However, due to Tokyo's earthquake-resistant infrastructure, damage in Tokyo was very minor compared to areas directly hit by the tsunami,[42] although activity in the city was largely halted.[43] The subsequent nuclear crisis caused by the tsunami has also largely left Tokyo unaffected, despite occasional spikes in radiation levels.[44][45]\n\n\nOn September 7, 2013, the IOC selected Tokyo to host the 2020 Summer Olympics. Tokyo thus became the first Asian city to host the Olympic Games twice.[46] However, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 Olympic Games took place from July 23, 2021, to August 8, 2021. It is also unclear how the city will deal with an increasing number of issues, urging scholars to offer possible alternatives approaches to tackle the most urgent problems.[47] Although, the COVID-19 pandemic in Tokyo has impeded the growth of many industries, the real estate market in Japan is yet to be negatively impacted. Japanese real estate has become one of the safest investments for foreign investors around the world.[48]\n\n\n\n* Gallery\n* ![Tokyo Tower, built in 1958](image)\n\nTokyo Tower, built in 1958\n* ![Yoyogi National Gymnasium, built for the 1964 Summer Olympics](image)\n\nYoyogi National Gymnasium, built for the 1964 Summer Olympics\n* ![Sunshine 60, at 239.7 m (786 ft), the tallest building in Asia until 1985, and in Japan until 1991](image)\n\nSunshine 60, at 239.7 m (786 ft), the tallest building in Asia until 1985, and in Japan until 1991\n\n\n## Geography and government[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tokyo Metropolitan Government\n\n![](image)A satellite photo of Tokyo in 2018 taken by ESA Sentinel-2\n![](image)The Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building\nThe mainland portion of Tokyo lies northwest of Tokyo Bay and measures about 90 km (56 mi) east to west and 25 km (16 mi) north to south. The average elevation in Tokyo is 40 m (131 ft).[49] Chiba Prefecture borders it to the east, Yamanashi to the west, Kanagawa to the south, and Saitama to the north. Mainland Tokyo is further subdivided into the special wards (occupying the eastern half) and the Tama area (多摩地域) stretching westwards. Tokyo has a latitude of 35.65 (near the 36th parallel north), which makes it more southern than Rome (41.90), Madrid (40.41), New York City (40.71) and Beijing (39.91).[50]\n\n\nWithin the administrative boundaries of Tokyo Metropolis are two island chains in the Pacific Ocean directly south: the Izu Islands, and the Ogasawara Islands, which stretch more than 1,000 km (620 mi) away from the mainland. Because of these islands and the mountainous regions to the west, Tokyo's overall population density figures far under-represent the real figures for the urban and suburban regions of Tokyo.[51]\n\n\nUnder Japanese law, the prefecture of Tokyo is designated as a *to* (都), translated as *metropolis*.[52] Tokyo Prefecture is the most populous prefecture and the densest, with 6,100 inhabitants per square kilometer (16,000/sq mi); by geographic area it is the third-smallest, above only Osaka and Kagawa. Its administrative structure is similar to that of Japan's other prefectures. The 23 special wards (特別区, *tokubetsu-ku*), which until 1943 constituted the city of Tokyo, are self-governing municipalities, each having a mayor, a council, and the status of a city.\n\n\nIn addition to these 23 special wards, Tokyo also includes 26 more cities (市 *-shi*), five towns (町 *-chō* or *machi*), and eight villages (村 *-son* or *-mura*), each of which has a local government. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government administers the whole metropolis including the 23 special wards and the cities and towns that constitute the prefecture. It is headed by a publicly elected governor and metropolitan assembly. Its headquarters is in Shinjuku Ward.\n\n\n\n![](image)\n### Municipalities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of cities in Tokyo Metropolis by population\n\n![](image)A map with Nishi-Tama District in green\n![](image)A map of the Izu Islands with black labels\n![](image)A map of the Ogasawara Islands with black labels\nSince 2001, Tokyo consists of 62 municipalities: 23 special wards, 26 cities, 5 towns and 8 villages. Any municipality of Japan has a directly elected mayor and a directly elected assembly, each elected on independent four-year cycles. 23 of Tokyo's municipalities cover the area that had been Tokyo City until WWII, 30 remain today in the Tama area (former North Tama, West Tama and South Tama districts), 9 on Tokyo's outlying islands.\n\n\n\n* The special wards (特別区, *tokubetsu-ku*) of Tokyo comprise the area formerly incorporated as Tokyo City. The special wards use the word \"city\" in their official English name (e.g. Chiyoda City). The wards differ from other cities in having a unique administrative relationship with the prefectural government. Certain municipal functions, such as waterworks, sewerage, and fire-fighting, are handled by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. To pay for the added administrative costs, the prefecture collects municipal taxes, which would usually be levied by the city.[53] The \"three central wards\" of Tokyo – Chiyoda, Chūō and Minato – are the business core of the city, with a daytime population more than seven times higher than their nighttime population.[54] Chiyoda Ward is unique in that it is in the very heart of the former Tokyo City, yet is one of the least populated wards. It is occupied by many major Japanese companies and is also the seat of the national government, and the Japanese emperor. It is often called the \"political center\" of the country.[55] Akihabara, known for being an otaku cultural center and a shopping district for computer goods, is also in Chiyoda.\n* To the west of the special wards, Tokyo Metropolis consists of cities, towns, and villages that enjoy the same legal status as those elsewhere in Japan. While serving as \"bed towns\" for those working in central Tokyo, some of them also have a local commercial and industrial base, such as Tachikawa. Collectively, these are often known as the Tama area or Western Tokyo. The far west of the Tama area is occupied by the district (*gun*) of Nishi-Tama. Much of this area is mountainous and unsuitable for urbanization. The highest mountain in Tokyo, Mount Kumotori, is 2,017 m (6,617 ft) high; other mountains in Tokyo include Takanosu (1,737 m (5,699 ft)), Odake (1,266 m (4,154 ft)), and Mitake (929 m (3,048 ft)). Lake Okutama, on the Tama River near Yamanashi Prefecture, is Tokyo's largest lake. The district is composed of three towns (Hinode, Mizuho and Okutama) and one village (Hinohara). The Tokyo Metropolitan Government has designated Hachiōji, Tachikawa, Machida, Ōme and Tama New Town as regional centers of the Tama area,[56] as part of its plans to relocate urban functions away from central Tokyo.\n* Tokyo has numerous outlying islands, which extend as far as 1,850 km (1,150 mi) from central Tokyo. Because of the islands' distance from the administrative headquarters of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government in Shinjuku, local subprefectural branch offices administer them. The Izu Islands are a group of volcanic islands and form part of the Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park. The islands in order from closest to Tokyo are Izu Ōshima, Toshima, Nii-jima, Shikine-jima, Kōzu-shima, Miyake-jima, Mikurajima, Hachijō-jima, and Aogashima. The Izu Islands are grouped into three subprefectures. Izu Ōshima and Hachijojima are towns. The remaining islands are six villages, with Niijima and Shikinejima forming one village. The Ogasawara Islands include, from north to south, Chichi-jima, Nishinoshima, Haha-jima, Kita Iwo Jima, Iwo Jima, and Minami Iwo Jima. Ogasawara also administers two tiny outlying islands: Minami Torishima, the easternmost point in Japan and at 1,850 km (1,150 mi) the most distant island from central Tokyo, and Okinotorishima, the southernmost point in Japan.[57] Japan's claim on an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) surrounding Okinotorishima is contested by China and South Korea as they regard Okinotorishima as uninhabitable rocks which have no EEZ.[58] The Iwo chain and the outlying islands have no permanent population, but hosts Japan Self-Defense Forces personnel. Local populations are only found on Chichi-Jima and Haha-Jima. The islands form both Ogasawara Subprefecture and the village of Ogasawara, Tokyo.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Flag, name w/o suffix | Full name\n | District orSubprefecture | Population\n | LPE code(w/o checksum)

Municipal mergers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of mergers in Tokyo\n\nWhen Tokyo reached its current extent except for smaller border changes in 1893, it consisted of over 170 municipalities, 1 (by definition: district-independent) city, nine districts with their towns and villages, plus the island communities that had never part of ritsuryō[*clarification needed*] districts. By 1953, the number of municipalities had dropped to 97. The current total of 62 was reached in 2001.\n\n\n\n### National parks[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ogasawara National Park, a UNESCO World Natural Heritage Site\nAs of March 31, 2008, 36% of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as Natural Parks (second only to Shiga Prefecture), namely the Chichibu Tama Kai, Fuji-Hakone-Izu, and Ogasawara National Parks (the last a UNESCO World Heritage Site); Meiji no Mori Takao Quasi-National Park; and Akikawa Kyūryō, Hamura Kusabana Kyūryō, Sayama, Takao Jinba, Takiyama, and Tama Kyūryō Prefectural Natural Parks.[60]\n\n\nA number of museums are located in Ueno Park: Tokyo National Museum, National Museum of Nature and Science, Shitamachi Museum and National Museum for Western Art, among others. There are also artworks and statues at several places in the park. There is also a zoo in the park, and the park is a popular destination to view cherry blossoms.\n\n\n\n### Earthquakes[edit]\n\n\n#### Minor quakes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A bilingual sign in Shibuya with instructions (in Japanese and English) in case of an earthquake\nTokyo is near the boundary of three plates, making it an extremely active region for smaller quakes and slippage which frequently affect the urban area with swaying as if in a boat, although epicenters within mainland Tokyo (excluding Tokyo's 2,000 km (1,243 mi)–long island jurisdiction) are quite rare. It is not uncommon in the metro area to have hundreds of these minor quakes (magnitudes 4–6) that can be felt in a single year, something local residents merely brush off but can be a source of anxiety not only for foreign visitors but for Japanese from elsewhere as well. They rarely cause much damage (sometimes a few injuries) as they are either too small or far away as quakes tend to dance around the region. Particularly active are offshore regions and to a lesser extent Chiba and Ibaraki.[61]\n\n\n\n#### Infrequent powerful quakes[edit]\n\n\nTokyo has been hit by powerful megathrust earthquakes in 1703, 1782, 1812, 1855, 1923, and much more indirectly (with some liquefaction in landfill zones) in 2011;[62][63] the frequency of direct and large quakes is a relative rarity. The 1923 earthquake, with an estimated magnitude of 8.3, killed 142,000 people, the last time the urban area was directly hit.\n\n\n\n### Volcanic eruptions[edit]\n\n\nMount Fuji is about 100 km (62 mi) southwest of Tokyo. There is a low risk of eruption. The last recorded was the Hōei eruption which started on December 16, 1707, and ended about January 1, 1708 (16 days).[64] During the Hōei eruption, the ash amount was 4 cm in southern Tokyo (bay area) and 2 cm to 0.5 cm in central Tokyo.[65] Kanagawa had 16 cm to 8 cm ash and Saitama 0.5 to 0 cm.[65] If the wind blows north-east it could send volcanic ash to Tokyo metropolis.[66] According to the government, less than a millimeter of the volcanic ash from a Mount Fuji eruption could cause power grid problems such as blackouts and stop trains in the Tokyo metropolitan area.[66] A mixture of ash with rain could stick to cellphone antennas, power lines and cause temporary power outages.[66] The affected areas would need to be evacuated.[66]\n\n\n\n### Water management[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The MAOUDC is the world's largest underground floodwater diversion facility.\nTokyo is located on the Kantō Plain with five river systems and dozens of rivers that expand during each season.[67] Important rivers are Edogawa, Nakagawa, Arakawa, Kandagawa, Megurogawa and Tamagawa.[68] In 1947, Typhoon Kathleen struck Tokyo, destroying 31,000 homes and killing 1,100 people.[67] In 1958, Typhoon Ida dropped 400 mm (16 in) of rain in a single week, causing streets to flood.[67] In the 1950s and 1960s, the government invested 6–7% of the national budget on disaster and risk reduction.[67] A huge system of dams, levees and tunnels was constructed.[67] The purpose is to manage heavy rain, typhonic rain, and river floods.[67]\n\n\nTokyo has currently the world's largest underground floodwater diversion facility called the Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel (MAOUDC).[14][67] It took 13 years to build and was completed in 2006. The MAOUDC is a 6.3 km (3.9 mi) long system of tunnels, 22 meters (72 ft) underground, with 70-meter (230 ft) tall cylindrical tanks, each tank being large enough to fit a space shuttle or the Statue of Liberty.[67] During floods, excess water is collected from rivers and drained to the Edo River.[68] Low-lying areas of Kōtō, Edogawa, Sumida, Katsushika, Taitō and Arakawa near the Arakawa River are most at risk of flooding.[68]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nThe former city of Tokyo and the majority of Tokyo prefecture lie in the humid subtropical climate zone (Köppen climate classification: *Cfa*),[69] with hot, humid summers and mild to cool winters with occasional cold spells. The region, like much of Japan, experiences a one-month seasonal lag. The warmest month is August, which averages 26.9 °C (80.4 °F). The coolest month is January, averaging 5.4 °C (41.7 °F). The record low temperature was −9.2 °C (15.4 °F) on January 13, 1876. The record high was 39.5 °C (103.1 °F) on July 20, 2004. \nThe record highest low temperature is 30.3 °C (86.5 °F), on August 12, 2013, making Tokyo one of only seven observation sites in Japan that have recorded a low temperature over 30 °C (86.0 °F).[70]\n\n\nAnnual rainfall averages nearly 1,600 millimeters (63.0 in), with a wetter summer and a drier winter. The growing season in Tokyo lasts for about 322 days from around mid-February to early January.[71] Snowfall is sporadic, and occurs almost annually.[72] Tokyo often sees typhoons every year, though few are strong. The wettest month since records began in 1876 was October 2004, with 780 millimeters (30 in) of rain,[73] including 270.5 mm (10.65 in) on the ninth of that month.[74] The most recent of four months on record to observe no precipitation is December 1995.[70] Annual precipitation has ranged from 879.5 mm (34.63 in) in 1984 to 2,229.6 mm (87.78 in) in 1938.[70]\n\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Kitanomaru Park, Chiyoda, Tokyo (1991–2020 normals, extremes 1875–present)[75][76] |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 22.6(72.7)\n | 24.9(76.8)\n | 25.3(77.5)\n | 29.2(84.6)\n | 32.6(90.7)\n | 36.4(97.5)\n | 39.5(103.1)\n | 39.1(102.4)\n | 38.1(100.6)\n | 32.6(90.7)\n | 27.5(81.5)\n | 24.8(76.6)\n | 39.5(103.1)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 9.8(49.6)\n | 10.9(51.6)\n | 14.2(57.6)\n | 19.4(66.9)\n | 23.6(74.5)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n | 29.9(85.8)\n | 31.3(88.3)\n | 27.5(81.5)\n | 22.0(71.6)\n | 16.7(62.1)\n | 12.0(53.6)\n | 20.3(68.5)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 5.4(41.7)\n | 6.1(43.0)\n | 9.4(48.9)\n | 14.3(57.7)\n | 18.8(65.8)\n | 21.9(71.4)\n | 25.7(78.3)\n | 26.9(80.4)\n | 23.3(73.9)\n | 18.0(64.4)\n | 12.5(54.5)\n | 7.7(45.9)\n | 15.8(60.4)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 1.2(34.2)\n | 2.1(35.8)\n | 5.0(41.0)\n | 9.8(49.6)\n | 14.6(58.3)\n | 18.5(65.3)\n | 22.4(72.3)\n | 23.5(74.3)\n | 20.3(68.5)\n | 14.8(58.6)\n | 8.8(47.8)\n | 3.8(38.8)\n | 12.1(53.8)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −9.2(15.4)\n | −7.9(17.8)\n | −5.6(21.9)\n | −3.1(26.4)\n | 2.2(36.0)\n | 8.5(47.3)\n | 13.0(55.4)\n | 15.4(59.7)\n | 10.5(50.9)\n | −0.5(31.1)\n | −3.1(26.4)\n | −6.8(19.8)\n | −9.2(15.4)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 59.7(2.35)\n | 56.5(2.22)\n | 116.0(4.57)\n | 133.7(5.26)\n | 139.7(5.50)\n | 167.8(6.61)\n | 156.2(6.15)\n | 154.7(6.09)\n | 224.9(8.85)\n | 234.8(9.24)\n | 96.3(3.79)\n | 57.9(2.28)\n | 1,598.2(62.92)\n |\n| Average snowfall cm (inches)\n | 4(1.6)\n | 4(1.6)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 8(3.1)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.5 mm) | 5.3\n | 6.1\n | 10.3\n | 10.9\n | 11.1\n | 12.8\n | 12.0\n | 9.4\n | 12.3\n | 11.8\n | 8.2\n | 5.8\n | 116.0\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 51\n | 52\n | 57\n | 62\n | 68\n | 75\n | 76\n | 74\n | 75\n | 71\n | 64\n | 56\n | 65\n |\n| Average dew point °C (°F)\n | −5(23)\n | −4(25)\n | 1(34)\n | 8(46)\n | 13(55)\n | 18(64)\n | 22(72)\n | 23(73)\n | 19(66)\n | 12(54)\n | 6(43)\n | −1(30)\n | 9(49)\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 192.6\n | 170.4\n | 175.3\n | 178.8\n | 179.6\n | 124.2\n | 151.4\n | 174.2\n | 126.7\n | 129.4\n | 149.8\n | 174.4\n | 1,926.7\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 61\n | 56\n | 47\n | 45\n | 41\n | 30\n | 34\n | 42\n | 34\n | 37\n | 48\n | 57\n | 44\n |\n| Average ultraviolet index | 2\n | 3\n | 5\n | 7\n | 9\n | 10\n | 10\n | 9\n | 7\n | 5\n | 3\n | 2\n | 6\n |\n| Source 1: Japan Meteorological Agency[77][78][70] |\n| Source 2: Weather Atlas (UV),[79] Time and Date (dewpoints, 1985–2015)[80] |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

Tokyo's Izu and Ogasawara islands are affected by an average of 5.4 typhoons a year, compared to 3.1 in mainland Kantō.[86]\n\n\n\n## Cityscape[edit]\n\n\nArchitecture in Tokyo has largely been shaped by Tokyo's history. Twice in recent history has the metropolis been left in ruins: first in the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake and later after extensive firebombing in World War II.[87] Because of this, Tokyo's urban landscape consists mainly of modern and contemporary architecture, and older buildings are scarce.[87] Tokyo features many internationally famous forms of modern architecture including Tokyo International Forum, Asahi Beer Hall, Mode Gakuen Cocoon Tower, NTT Docomo Yoyogi Building and Rainbow Bridge. Tokyo features two distinctive towers: Tokyo Tower and Tokyo Skytree, the latter of which is the tallest tower in both Japan and the world, and the second tallest structure in the world after the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.[13] Mori Building Co started work on Tokyo's new tallest building which was set to be finished in March 2023. The project will cost 580 billion yen ($5.5 billion).[88]\n\n\nTokyo contains numerous parks and gardens. There are four national parks in Tokyo Prefecture, including the Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park, which includes all of the Izu Islands.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nA panoramic view of Tokyo from the Tokyo Skytree\n\n## Environment[edit]\n\n\nTokyo has enacted a measure to cut greenhouse gases. Governor Shintaro Ishihara created Japan's first emissions cap system, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emission by a total of 25% by 2020 from the 2000 level.[89] Tokyo is an example of an urban heat island, and the phenomenon is especially serious in its special wards.[90][91] According to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government,[92] the annual mean temperature has increased by about 3 °C (5.4 °F) over the past 100 years. Tokyo has been cited as a \"convincing example of the relationship between urban growth and climate\".[90]\n\n\nIn 2006, Tokyo enacted the \"10 Year Project for Green Tokyo\" to be realized by 2016. It set a goal of increasing roadside trees in Tokyo to 1 million (from 480,000), and adding 1,000 ha (2,500 acres) of green space, 88 ha (220 acres) of which will be a new park named \"Umi no Mori\" (Sea Forest) which will be on a reclaimed island in Tokyo Bay which used to be a landfill.[93] From 2007 to 2010, 436 ha (1,080 acres) of the planned 1,000 ha of green space was created and 220,000 trees were planted, bringing the total to 700,000.

This effect is even more pronounced in the three central wards of Chiyoda, Chūō, and Minato, whose collective population as of the 2005 National Census was 326,000 at night, but 2.4 million during the day.[96]\n\n\nIn 1889, the Home Ministry recorded 1,375,937 people in Tokyo City and a total of 1,694,292 people in Tokyo-fu.[97] In the same year, a total of 779 foreign nationals were recorded as residing in Tokyo. The most common nationality was English (209 residents), followed by American (182) and Chinese nationals (137).[98]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)Tokyo historical population since 1920 | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Registered foreign nationals**[99] |\n| Nationality | Population (2018)\n |\n| China | 199,949\n |\n| South Korea | 90,438\n |\n| Vietnam | 32,334\n |\n| Philippines | 32,089\n |\n| Nepal | 26,157\n |\n| Taiwan | 18,568\n |\n| North America (United States and Canada) | 17,578\n |\n| India | 11,153\n |\n| Myanmar | 9,719\n |\n| Thailand | 7,958\n |\n| Others | 75,557\n |\n\n |\n| ![](image)This chart is growth rate of municipalities of Tokyo, Japan.

According to a study conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the Greater Tokyo Area (Tokyo–Yokohama, TYO) of 38 million people had a total GDP of $2 trillion in 2012 (at purchasing power parity), which topped that list.\n\n\nTokyo is a major international finance center;[100] it houses the headquarters of several of the world's largest investment banks and insurance companies, and serves as a hub for Japan's transportation, publishing, electronics and broadcasting industries. During the centralized growth of Japan's economy following World War II, many large firms moved their headquarters from cities such as Osaka (the historical commercial capital) to Tokyo, in an attempt to take advantage of better access to the government. This trend has begun to slow due to ongoing population growth in Tokyo and the high cost of living there.\n\n\nTokyo was rated by the Economist Intelligence Unit as the most expensive (highest cost-of-living) city in the world for 14 years in a row ending in 2006, when it was replaced by Oslo, and later Paris.[101][102]\n\n\nTokyo emerged as a leading international financial center (IFC) in the 1960s and has been described as one of the three \"command centers\" for the world economy, along with New York City and London.[103] In the 2020 Global Financial Centers Index, Tokyo was ranked as having the fourth most competitive financial center in the world (alongside cities such as New York City, London, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore, Beijing, San Francisco, Shenzhen and Zurich in the top 10), and second most competitive in Asia (after Shanghai).[12] The Japanese financial market opened up slowly in 1984 and accelerated its internationalization with the \"Japanese Big Bang\" in 1998.[104] Despite the emergence of Singapore and Hong Kong as competing financial centers, the Tokyo IFC manages to keep a prominent position in Asia. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is Japan's largest stock exchange, and third largest in the world by market capitalization and fourth largest by share turnover. In 1990 at the end of the Japanese asset price bubble, it accounted for more than 60% of the world stock market value.[105] Tokyo had 8,460 hectares (20,900 acres) of agricultural land as of 2003,[106] according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, placing it last among the nation's prefectures. The farmland is concentrated in Western Tokyo. Perishables such as vegetables, fruits, and flowers can be conveniently shipped to the markets in the eastern part of the prefecture. *Komatsuna* and spinach are the most important vegetables; as of 2000, Tokyo supplied 32.5% of the *komatsuna* sold at its central produce market.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nWith 36% of its area covered by forest, Tokyo has extensive growths of cryptomeria and Japanese cypress, especially in the mountainous western communities of Akiruno, Ōme, Okutama, Hachiōji, Hinode, and Hinohara. Decreases in the price of timber, increases in the cost of production, and advancing old age among the forestry population have resulted in a decline in Tokyo's output. In addition, pollen, especially from cryptomeria, is a major allergen for the nearby population centers. Tokyo Bay was once a major source of fish. Most of Tokyo's fish production comes from the outer islands, such as Izu Ōshima and Hachijō-Jima. Skipjack tuna, nori, and *aji* are among the ocean products.[107]\n\n\nTourism in Tokyo is also a contributor to the economy. In 2006, 4.81 million foreigners and 420 million Japanese visits to Tokyo were made; the economic value of these visits totaled 9.4 trillion yen according to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. Many tourists visit the various downtowns, stores, and entertainment districts throughout the neighborhoods of the special wards of Tokyo. Cultural offerings include both omnipresent Japanese pop culture and associated districts such as Shibuya and Harajuku, subcultural attractions such as Studio Ghibli anime center, as well as museums like the Tokyo National Museum, which houses 37% of the country's artwork national treasures (87/233).\n\n\nThe Toyosu Market in Tokyo is the largest wholesale fish and seafood market in the world since it opened on October 11, 2018.[108] It is also one of the largest wholesale food markets of any kind. It is located in the Toyosu area of Kōtō ward. The Toyosu Market holds strong to the traditions of its predecessor, the Tsukiji Fish Market and Nihonbashi fish market, and serves some 50,000 buyers and sellers every day. Retailers, whole-sellers, auctioneers, and public citizens alike frequent the market, creating a unique microcosm of organized chaos that still continues to fuel the city and its food supply after over four centuries.[109]\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transportation in Greater Tokyo\n\n![](image)Tokyo Station is the main intercity rail terminal in Tokyo.\n![](image)Haneda Airport\n![](image)Tokyo Metro and Toei Subway are two main subway operators in Tokyo.\n![](image)Hamazakibashi JCT in Shuto Expressway\nTokyo, which is the center of the Greater Tokyo Area, is Japan's largest domestic and international hub for rail and ground transportation. Public transportation within Tokyo is dominated by an extensive network of \"clean and efficient\"[110] trains and subways run by a variety of operators, with buses, monorails and trams playing a secondary feeder role. There are up to 62 electric train lines and more than 900 train stations in Tokyo.[111] Shibuya Crossing is the \"world's busiest pedestrian crossing\", with around 3,000 people crossing at a time.[112][113][114]\n\n\nNarita International Airport in Chiba Prefecture is the major gateway for international travelers to Japan. Japan's flag carrier Japan Airlines, as well as All Nippon Airways, have a hub at this airport. Haneda Airport on the reclaimed land at Ōta, offers domestic and international flights.\n\n\nVarious islands governed by Tokyo have their own airports. Hachijō-jima (Hachijojima Airport), Miyakejima (Miyakejima Airport), and Izu Ōshima (Oshima Airport) have services to Tokyo International and other airports.\n\n\nRail is the primary mode of transportation in Tokyo,[115] which has the most extensive urban railway network in the world and an equally extensive network of surface lines. JR East operates Tokyo's largest railway network, including the Yamanote Line loop that circles the center of downtown Tokyo. It operates rail lines in the entire metropolitan area of Tokyo and in the rest of the northeastern part of Honshu. JR East is also responsible for Shinkansen high-speed rail lines.\n\n\nTwo different organizations operate the subway network: the private Tokyo Metro and the governmental Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation. The Metropolitan Government and private carriers operate bus routes and one tram route. Local, regional, and national services are available, with major terminals at the giant railroad stations, including Tokyo, Shinagawa, and Shinjuku.\n\n\nExpressways link the capital to other points in the Greater Tokyo Area, the Kantō region, and the islands of Kyushu and Shikoku. To build them quickly before the 1964 Summer Olympics, most were constructed above existing roads.[116] Other transportation includes taxis operating in the special wards and the cities and towns. Also, long-distance ferries serve the islands of Tokyo and carry passengers and cargo to domestic and foreign ports.\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Tokyo\n\nSee also: List of universities in Tokyo\n\nTokyo has many universities, junior colleges, and vocational schools. Many of Japan's most prestigious universities are in Tokyo, including University of Tokyo, Hitotsubashi University, Meiji University, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Waseda University, Tokyo University of Science, Sophia University, and Keio University.[117] Some of the biggest national universities in Tokyo are:\n\n\n\n* Hitotsubashi University\n* National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies\n* Ochanomizu University\n* Tokyo Gakugei University\n* Tokyo Institute of Technology\n* Tokyo Medical and Dental University\n* Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology\n* Tokyo University of Foreign Studies\n* Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology\n* Tokyo University of the Arts\n* University of Electro-Communications\n* University of Tokyo\n\nThere is only one non-national public university: Tokyo Metropolitan University. There are also a few universities well known for classes conducted in English and for the teaching of the Japanese language, including the Globis University Graduate School of Management, International Christian University, Sophia University, and Waseda University\n\n\nTokyo is also the headquarters of the United Nations University.\n\n\nMost publicly run kindergartens, elementary schools (years 1 through 6), and junior high (lower secondary) schools (7 through 9) are operated by local wards or municipal offices. Most public senior high (upper secondary) schools in Tokyo are run by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Board of Education and are called \"Metropolitan High Schools\". Tokyo also has many private schools from kindergarten through high school:\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * ![Yasuda Auditorium at the University of Tokyo in Bunkyō](image)\n\nYasuda Auditorium at the University of Tokyo in Bunkyō\n* ![Okuma Auditorium at Waseda University in Shinjuku](image)\n\nOkuma Auditorium at Waseda University in Shinjuku\n* ![Hibiya High School in Chiyoda](image)\n\nHibiya High School in Chiyoda\n |\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation, also known as \"Miraikan\"\n![](image)Takeshita Street in Harajuku\nTokyo has many museums. In Ueno Park, there is the Tokyo National Museum, the country's largest museum and specializing in traditional Japanese art; the National Museum of Western Art and Ueno Zoo. Other museums include the National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation in Odaiba; the Edo-Tokyo Museum in Sumida, across the Sumida River from the center of Tokyo; the Nezu Museum in Aoyama; and the National Diet Library, National Archives, and the National Museum of Modern Art, which are near the Imperial Palace.\n\n\nTokyo has many theaters for performing arts. These include national and private theaters for traditional forms of Japanese drama. Noteworthy are the National Noh Theatre for noh and the Kabuki-za for Kabuki.[118] Symphony orchestras and other musical organizations perform modern and traditional music. The New National Theater Tokyo in Shibuya is the national center for the performing arts, including opera, ballet, contemporary dance and drama.[119] Tokyo also hosts modern Japanese and international pop, and rock music at venues ranging in size from intimate clubs to internationally known areas such as the Nippon Budokan.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Sanja Festival in Asakusa\nMany different festivals occur throughout Tokyo. Major events include the Sannō at Hie Shrine, the Sanja at Asakusa Shrine, and the biennial Kanda Festivals. The last features a parade with elaborately decorated floats and thousands of people. Annually on the last Saturday of July, an enormous fireworks display over the Sumida River attracts over a million viewers. Once cherry blossoms bloom in spring, many residents gather in Ueno Park, Inokashira Park, and the Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden for picnics under the blossoms.\n\n\nHarajuku, a neighborhood in Shibuya, is known internationally for its youth style, fashion[120] and cosplay.\n\n\nIn November 2007, Michelin released their first guide for fine dining in Tokyo, awarding 191 stars in total, or about twice as many as Tokyo's nearest competitor, Paris. As of 2017, 227 restaurants in Tokyo have been awarded (92 in Paris). Twelve establishments were awarded the maximum of three stars (Paris has 10), 54 received two stars, and 161 earned one star.[121]\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sports in Tokyo\n\n![](image)Japan National Stadium\n![](image)Ryōgoku Kokugikan sumo wrestling arena\nTokyo, with a diverse array of sports, is home to two professional baseball clubs, the Yomiuri Giants who play at the Tokyo Dome and Tokyo Yakult Swallows at Meiji-Jingu Stadium. The Japan Sumo Association is also headquartered in Tokyo at the Ryōgoku Kokugikan sumo arena where three official sumo tournaments are held annually (in January, May, and September). Soccer clubs in Tokyo include F.C. Tokyo and Tokyo Verdy 1969, both of which play at Ajinomoto Stadium in Chōfu, and FC Machida Zelvia at Nozuta Stadium in Machida. Rugby Union is also played in Tokyo, with multiple Japan Rugby League One clubs based in the city including: Black Rams Tokyo (Setagaya), Tokyo Sungoliath (Fuchū) and Toshiba Brave Lupus Tokyo (Fuchū).\n\n\nBasketball clubs include the Hitachi SunRockers, Toyota Alvark Tokyo and Tokyo Excellence.\n\n\nTokyo hosted the 1964 Summer Olympics, thus becoming the first Asian city to host the Summer Games. The National Stadium, also known as the Olympic Stadium, was host to a number of international sporting events. In 2016, it was to be replaced by the New National Stadium. With a number of world-class sports venues, Tokyo often hosts national and international sporting events such as basketball tournaments, women's volleyball tournaments, tennis tournaments, swim meets, marathons, rugby union and sevens rugby games, soccer exhibition games, judo, and karate. Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium, in Sendagaya, Shibuya, is a large sports complex that includes swimming pools, training rooms, and a large indoor arena. According to *Around the Rings*, the gymnasium has played host to the October 2011 artistic gymnastics world championships, despite the International Gymnastics Federation's initial doubt in Tokyo's ability to host the championships following the March 11 tsunami.[122] Tokyo was also selected to host a number of games for the 2019 Rugby World Cup, and to host the 2020 Summer Olympics and the Paralympics which had to be rescheduled to the summer of 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan.\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Akihabara is the most popular area for fans of anime, manga, and games.\n![](image)FCG Building, home of Fuji TV headquarters\nAs the largest population center in Japan and the site of the country's largest broadcasters and studios, Tokyo is frequently the setting for many Japanese movies, television shows, animated series' (anime), web comics, light novels, video games, and comic books (manga). In the *kaiju* (monster movie) genre, landmarks of Tokyo are usually destroyed by giant monsters such as Godzilla and Gamera.\n\n\nTokyo is also a popular foreign setting for non-Japanese media. Some Hollywood directors have turned to Tokyo as a backdrop for movies set in Japan. Postwar examples include *Tokyo Joe*, *My Geisha*, *Tokyo Story* and the James Bond film *You Only Live Twice*; recent examples include *Kill Bill*, *The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift*, *Lost in Translation*, *Babel*, *Inception*, *The Wolverine* and *Avengers: Endgame*.\n\n\nJapanese author Haruki Murakami has based some of his novels in Tokyo (including *Norwegian Wood*), and David Mitchell's first two novels (*number9dream* and *Ghostwritten*) featured the city. Contemporary British painter Carl Randall spent 10 years living in Tokyo as an artist, creating a body of work depicting the city's crowded streets and public spaces.[123][124][125][126][127]\n\n\n\n## International relations[edit]\n\n\nTokyo is the founding member of the Asian Network of Major Cities 21 and is a member of the Council of Local Authorities for International Relations. Tokyo was also a founding member of the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group.\n\n\n\n### Sister cities and states[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of twin towns and sister cities in Japan\n\nAs of 2022[update], Tokyo has twinning or friendship agreements with the following twelve cities and states:[128]\n\n\n\n* New York City, United States (since February 1960)\n* Beijing, China (since March 1979)\n* Paris, France (since July 1982)[129]\n* New South Wales, Australia (since May 1984)\n* Seoul, South Korea (since September 1988)\n* Jakarta, Indonesia (since October 1989)\n* São Paulo State, Brazil (since June 1990)\n* Cairo, Egypt (since October 1990)\n* Moscow, Russia (since July 1991)\n* Berlin, Germany (since May 1994)\n* Rome, Italy (since July 1996)\n* London, United Kingdom (since October 2015)\n\n### Friendship and cooperation agreements[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.
