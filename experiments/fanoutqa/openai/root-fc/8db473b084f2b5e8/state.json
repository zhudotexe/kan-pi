Founded in 1386 on instruction of Pope Urban VI, Heidelberg is Germany's oldest university and one of the world's oldest surviving universities; it was the third university established in the Holy Roman Empire after Vienna and Prague. Since 1899, it has been a coeducational institution. \n\n\nHeidelberg is one of the most prestigious universities in Germany.[6] It is a German Excellence University, part of the U15, as well as a founding member of the League of European Research Universities and the Coimbra Group. The university consists of twelve faculties and offers degree programmes at undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral levels in some 100 disciplines.[7] The language of instruction is usually German, while a considerable number of graduate degrees are offered in English as well as some in French.[8][9]\n\n\nAs of 2021,[update] 57 Nobel Prize winners have been affiliated with the city of Heidelberg and 33 with the university itself.[10] Modern scientific psychiatry, psychopharmacology, experimental psychology, psychiatric genetics, Mathematical statistics,[11] environmental physics,[12] and modern sociology[13] were introduced as scientific disciplines by Heidelberg students or faculty. Approximately 1,000 doctorates are completed every year, with more than one third of the doctoral students coming from abroad.[14][15] International students from some 130 countries account for more than 20 percent of the entire student body.[16]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Heidelberg University\n\n### Founding[edit]\n\n\n![](image)In 1386, Heidelberg University was founded by Rupert I on instruction of Pope Urban VI who demanded modelling it after the ancient University of Paris.\nThe Great Schism of 1378 made it possible for Heidelberg, a relatively small city and capital of the Electorate of the Palatinate, to gain its own university.[17] The Great Schism was initiated by the election of two popes after the death of Pope Gregory XI in the same year.[17] One successor resided in Avignon (elected by the French) and the other in Rome (elected by the Italian cardinals).[17] The German secular and spiritual leaders voiced their support for the successor in Rome, which had far-reaching consequences for the German students and teachers in Paris: they lost their stipends and had to leave.[18]\n\n\nRupert I recognized the opportunity and initiated talks with the Curia, which ultimately led to a papal bull for foundation of a university. After having received, on 23 October 1385, permission from pope Urban VI to create a school of general studies (Latin: *studium generale*), the final decision to found the university was taken on 26 June 1386 at the behest of Rupert I, Count Palatine of the Rhine.[19] As specified in the papal charter, the university was modelled after the University of Paris and included four faculties: philosophy, theology, jurisprudence, and medicine.[20]\n\n\nOn 18 October 1386 a special Pontifical High Mass in the *Heiliggeistkirche* was the ceremony that established the university.[19] On 19 October 1386 the first lecture was held,[19] making Heidelberg the oldest university in Germany.[21] In November 1386, Marsilius of Inghen was elected first rector of the university.[22] The rector seal motto was *semper apertus*\u2014i.e., \"the book of learning is always open.\"[23] The university grew quickly and in March 1390, 185 students were enrolled at the university.[24]\n\n\n\n![](image)A Solemn Mass was offered in the *Heiliggeistkirche* in 1386 to mark and bless the establishment of the university.\n### Late Middle Ages[edit]\n\n\nBetween 1414 and 1418, theology and jurisprudence professors of the university took part in the Council of Constance and acted as counselors for Louis III, who attended this council as representative of the emperor and chief magistrate of the realm. This resulted in establishing a good reputation for the university and its professors.[25]\n\n\nDue to the influence of Marsilius, the university initially taught the nominalism or *via moderna*. In 1412, both realism and the teachings of John Wycliffe were forbidden at the university but later, around 1454, the university decided that realism or *via antique* would also be taught, thus introducing two parallel ways (*ambae viae*).[26]\n\n\nThe transition from scholastic to humanistic culture was effected by the chancellor and bishop Johann von Dalberg in the late 15th century. Humanism was represented at Heidelberg University particularly by the founder of the older German Humanistic School Rudolph Agricola, Conrad Celtes, Jakob Wimpfeling, and Johann Reuchlin. \u00c6neas Silvius Piccolomini was chancellor of the university in his capacity as provost of Worms, and later always favored it with his friendship and good-will as Pope Pius II. In 1482, Pope Sixtus IV permitted laymen and married men to be appointed professors in the ordinary of medicine through a papal dispensation. In 1553, Pope Julius III sanctioned the allotment of ecclesiastical benefices to secular professors.[27]\n\n\n\n### Reformation and modern era[edit]\n\n\nMartin Luther's disputation at Heidelberg in April 1518 made a lasting impact, and his adherents among the masters and scholars soon became leading Reformationists in Southwest Germany. With the Electorate of the Palatinate turn to the Reformed faith, Otto Henry, Elector Palatine, converted the university into a calvinistic institution. In 1563, the Heidelberg Catechism was created under collaboration of members of the university's divinity school.\n\n\nAs the 16th century was passing, the late humanism stepped beside Calvinism as a predominant school of thought; and figures like Paul Schede, Jan Gruter, Martin Opitz, and Matth\u00e4us Merian taught at the university. It attracted scholars from all over the continent and developed into a cultural and academic center.[28] However, with the beginning of the Thirty Years' War in 1618, the intellectual and fiscal wealth of the university declined. In 1622, the then-world-famous Bibliotheca Palatina (the library of the university) was stolen from the University Cathedral and taken to Rome. The reconstruction efforts thereafter were defeated by the troops of King Louis XIV, who destroyed Heidelberg in 1693 almost completely.[29][30]\n\n\nAs a consequence of the late Counter-Reformation, the university lost its Protestant character, and was channeled by Jesuits. From 1712 to 1728, the Old University was constructed at University Square, then known as Domus Wilhelmina. Through the efforts of the Jesuits a preparatory seminary was established, the Seminarium ad Carolum Borrom\u00e6um, whose pupils were also registered in the university. After the suppression of the Jesuit Order, most of the schools they had conducted passed into the hands of the French Congregation of Lazarists in 1773. They deteriorated from that time forward.\n\n\nMeanwhile, the university itself continued to lose in prestige until the reign of the last elector Charles Theodore, Elector Palatine, who established new chairs for all the faculties, founded scientific institutes such as the Electoral Academy of Science, and transferred the school of political economy from Kaiserslautern to Heidelberg, where it was combined with the university as the faculty of political economy. He also founded an observatory in the neighboring city of Mannheim, where Jesuit Christian Mayer labored as director. In connection with the four hundredth anniversary of the university, the elector approved a revised statute book that several professors had been commissioned to prepare. The financial affairs of the university, its receipts and expenditures, were put in order. At that time, the number of students varied from 300 to 400; in the jubilee year, 133 matriculated.\n\n\nAs a consequence of the disturbances caused by the French Revolution, and particularly because of the Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville, the university lost all its property on the left bank of the Rhine, so that its complete dissolution was expected.[31]\n\n\n\n### 19th and early 20th century[edit]\n\n\nThis decline did not stop until 1803, when the university was reestablished as a state-owned institution by Karl Friedrich, Grand Duke of Baden, to whom the part of the Palatinate situated on the right bank of the Rhine was allotted. Since then, the university bears his name together with the name of Ruprecht I. Karl Friedrich divided the university into five faculties and placed himself at its head as rector, as did also his successors. During this decade, Romanticism found expression in Heidelberg through Clemens Brentano, Achim von Arnim, Ludwig Tieck, Joseph G\u00f6rres, and Joseph von Eichendorff, and there went forth a revival of the German Middle Ages in speech, poetry, and art.[28]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Old Assembly Hall or \"Great Hall\" was redesigned in 1886 in celebration of the university's quincentenary.\nThe German Students Association exerted great influence, which was at first patriotic and later political. After Romanticism had eventually died out, Heidelberg became a center of Liberalism and the movement in favor of German national unity.[28] The historians Friedrich Christoph Schlosser and Georg Gottfried Gervinus were the guides of the nation in political history. The modern scientific schools of medicine and natural science, particularly astronomy, were models in point of construction and equipment, and Heidelberg University was especially noted for its influential law school.[31] The university as a whole became the role model for the transformation of American liberal arts colleges into research universities, in particular for the then-newly established Johns Hopkins University.[32] Heidelberg's professors were important supporters of the Vorm\u00e4rz revolution and many of them were members of the first freely elected German parliament, the Frankfurt Parliament of 1848. During the late 19th century, the university housed a very liberal and open-minded spirit, which was deliberately fostered by Max Weber, Ernst Troeltsch and a circle of colleagues around them.\n\n\nIn February 1900, the Grand Duchy of Baden issued a decree that gave women the right to access universities in Baden. Thus, the universities of Freiburg and Heidelberg were the first ones to allow women to study.\n\n\nIn the Weimar Republic, the university was widely recognized as a center of democratic thinking, coined by professors like Karl Jaspers, Gustav Radbruch, Martin Dibelius and Alfred Weber.[28] Unfortunately, there were also dark forces working within the university: Nazi physicist Philipp Lenard was head of the physical institute during that time. Following the assassination of the liberal German-Jewish Foreign Minister Walther Rathenau, he refused to half mast the national flag on the institute, thereby provoking its storming by communist students.[29]\n\n\n\n![](image)The main entrance of the New University building in 1988, showing the bronze bust of Athena, the Greek goddess of wisdom\n### Nazi Germany[edit]\n\n\nSee also: University education in Nazi Germany\n\nAfter the establishment of Nazi Germany in 1933, the university supported Adolf Hitler and the Nazis like all other German universities at the time. It dismissed a large number of staff and students for political and racial reasons. Many dissident fellows had to emigrate and most Jewish and Communist professors who did not leave Germany were deported. At least two professors directly fell victim to Nazi terror.[33] On 17 May 1933, members of the university faculty and students took part in book burnings at *Universit\u00e4tsplatz* (\"University Square\")[34] and Heidelberg eventually became infamous as a NSDAP university. The inscription above the main entrance of the New University was changed from \"The Living Spirit\" to \"The German Spirit\",[35] and many professors paid homage to the new motto. The university was involved in Nazi eugenics: forced sterilizations were carried out at the women's clinic and the psychiatric clinic, then directed by Carl Schneider, was involved in Action T4 Euthanasia program.[36][37]\n\n\nThe heads of the university helped in the deportation of Jewish men, women and children directly to the gas chambers.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAfter the end of World War II, the university underwent an extensive denazification.\n\n\n\n### Federal Republic of Germany[edit]\n\n\nSince Heidelberg was spared from destruction during World War II, the reconstruction of the university was realized rather quickly. With the foundation of the Collegium Academicum, Heidelberg University became the home of Germany's first and, until today, only self-governed student hall. Newly laid statutes obliged the university to \"The Living Spirit of Truth, Justice and Humanity\".[29]\n\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, the university grew dramatically in size. At this time, it developed into one of the main scenes of the left-wing student protests in Germany.[38] In 1975, a massive police force arrested the entire student parliament AStA. Shortly thereafter, the building of the Collegium Academicum, a progressive college in immediate vicinity to the university's main grounds, was stormed by over 700 police officers and closed once and for all. On the outskirts of the city, in the Neuenheimer Feld area, a large campus for medicine and natural sciences was constructed.[29]\n\n\nToday, about 28,000 students are enrolled for studies at Heidelberg University.[39] There are 4,196 full-time faculty, including 476 university professors.[15] In 2007, and again in 2012, the university was appointed *University of Excellence* under an initiative started by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research and the German Research Foundation. This enhanced the German university system by establishing a small network of exceptionally well-funded universities, which are expected to generate strong international appeal.[40]\n\n\nIn 2022, a mass shooting occurred in the university, killing a woman and injuring three other people. The gunman then committed suicide.[41]\n\n\n\n## Campuses[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Heidelberg\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| \"I saw Heidelberg on a perfectly clear morning, with a pleasant air both cool and invigorating. The city, just so, with the totality of its ambiance is, one might say, something ideal.\"\n |\n| \u2014 Johann Wolfgang von Goethe[42] |\n\n\nHeidelberg is a city with approximately 140,000 inhabitants. It is situated in the Rhine Neckar Triangle, a European metropolitan area with approximately 2.4 million people living there, comprising the neighboring cities of Heidelberg, Mannheim, Ludwigshafen, and a number of smaller towns in the perimeter. Heidelberg is known as the cradle of Romanticism, and its old town and castle are among the most frequented tourist destinations in Germany. Its pedestrian zone is a shopping and night life magnet for the surrounding area and beyond. Heidelberg is about 40\u00a0minutes by train away from Frankfurt International Airport.[43]\nHeidelberg University's facilities are, generally speaking, separated in two parts. The faculties and institutes of humanities and social sciences are embedded in the Old Town Campus. The sciences faculties and the medical school, including three large university hospitals, are located on the New Campus in the Neuenheimer Feld on the outskirts of Heidelberg.[44]\n\n\n\n### Old Town Campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The New University of 1931 as seen from the Old University\nThe so-called New University is regarded as the center of the Old Town Campus. It is situated at the *Universit\u00e4tsplatz* (University Square) in the pedestrian zone, in direct vicinity to the University Library and to the main administration buildings. The New University was officially opened in 1931. Its erection was largely financed by donations of wealthy American families, in line with a fundraising campaign of Jacob Gould Schurman, an alumnus of Heidelberg University and former United States Ambassador to Germany.[45] It houses the new assembly hall, the largest lecture halls, and a number of smaller seminar rooms, mostly used by faculties of humanities and social sciences. Education in humanities and social sciences takes place to a great extent in buildings spread over the ancient part of town, though most are less than ten minutes walk from University Square. The faculties maintain their own extensive libraries and work spaces for students. Seminars and tutorials are usually held in the faculty buildings.[44]\n\n\n\n### Neuenheimer Feld \u2013 New Campus[edit]\n\n\nMain article: New Campus (Heidelberg University)\n\n  \n\nIn the 1960s the university started building a new campus near the city district Neuenheim, called the Neuenheimer Feld. It is today the largest part of the university, and the largest campus for natural sciences and life science in Germany.[15] Almost all science faculties and institutes, the medical school, University Hospital Heidelberg, and the science branch of the University Library are situated on the New Campus. Most of the dormitories and the athletic facilities of the university can be found there as well.\n\n\nSeveral independent research institutes, such as the German Cancer Research Center and two of the Max-Planck-Institutes have settled there. The New Campus is also the seat of several biomedical spin-off companies. The old part of town can be reached by tram and bus in about 10\u00a0minutes. The Neuenheimer Feld campus has extensive parking lots for faculty and student vehicles for long term and short term parking, as well as visitors and patients of the various university hospitals. The Faculty of Physics and Astronomy is not located on either campus, but on the Philosophers' Walk, separated from the Old Town by the River Neckar, and some 2\u00a0km (1.2\u00a0mi) away from the New Campus. It also maintains observatory facilities on the K\u00f6nigstuhl Mountain.[44]\n\n\nThe university maintains a botanical garden at Neuenheimer Feld.[46]\n\n\n\n### Bergheim Campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Bergheim Campus houses Economics and the Social Sciences.\nThe Bergheim Campus is located in the former Ludolf Krehl clinic (named after Ludolf von Krehl) in the inner-city suburb of Heidelberg-Bergheim. Since March 2009 it has housed the institutes economics, political science, and sociology (together the Heidelberg University Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences) that formerly resided at the Old Town campus. The Bergheim campus offers one lecture theatre, several seminar rooms, the most modern of the university libraries, and a cafe (rather than the full cafeteria present in the other campuses). Since 2019, the Bergheim Campus has also become the location of the Centre for Asian and Transcultural Studies of the Heidelberg University.\n\n\n\n### Libraries[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Heidelberg University Library\n\n![](image)The main building of the University Library, built in 1905\nThe University Library is the main library of the university. Together with the branch libraries, serving the faculties and institutes, it forms the integral university library system comprising approximately 6.2 million printed volumes. The University Library's holdings exceeded one million in 1934. Today, it comprises about 3.2 million books, about 500,000 other media such as microfilms and video tapes, as well as 6,000 printed scientific periodicals. Moreover, it has 6,900 manuscripts, 1,800 incunabula, 110,500 autographs, and a collection of old maps, paintings, and photographs. Furthermore, the 38 branch libraries add another 3.0 million printed books. In 2022, 43,600 active users accessed 746,000 books. Additionally, the University Library provides a wide array of online resources, among them 152,000 scientific e-journals.[47]\n\n\nThe origins of today's University Library date back to 1386, the year the university was founded. Surrounding the new university, the libraries of the faculty of the arts, the three higher faculties (theology, law, medicine) and the collegiate library grew. The acquisition of a box of records, which was housed in the Heiliggeistkirche, through the rector, Marsilius of Inghen, in 1388 contributed fundamentally to the development of the library. In the 16th century, Otto Henry, Elector Palatine, combined the miscellaneous book collections accrued since the foundation of the university with the princely library housed in Heidelberg Castle to form the Bibliotheca Palatina and made them publicly accessible in the galleries of the Heiliggeistkirche. Among these collections, inherited records of the Fuggers (Augsburg, Ulrich Fugger the Elder) wereof particular importance. The majority of the library holdings, which enjoyed great contemporary renown, was looted during the Thirty Years\u2019 War, transported to Rome and was gifted to Pope Gregory XV by the victorious Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria in 1622. After the secularization in 1804, the holdings of the monasteries of Salem and Petershausen formed the foundation of the reconstruction of the library collection in the 19th century. In 1816, 847 German-language manuscripts from the Bibliotheca Palatina returned to Heidelberg. As part of an exchange, the Codex Manesse, which had ended up in the Royal Library in Paris, followed in 1888. Karl Zangemeister (1837\u20131902) became the first full-time head of the university library in 1912. Based on the designs of architect Joseph Durum, a dedicated library building, a richly ornamented, four-winged red sandstone construction, was erected from 1901 to 1905. In 1978, a branch library opened in the Neuenheimer Feld, serving the institutes of natural sciences and medicine.\n\n\nSince 2021, all manuscripts of the Bibliotheca Palatina are accessible digitally online (848 German-language Palatina manuscripts, 2,030 Latin, 423 Greek, 267 Hebrew and 20 manuscripts in other languages).[48] Their digitization was achieved through the cooperation of Heidelberg University Library and the Vatican Library.\n\n\nThe university library expands its publication services: The Heidelberg document server heiDOK is an open access platform for members of the university. The university bibliography heiBIB lists all academic publications by university members. In 2015, Heidelberg University founded the publishing house Heidelberg University Publishing \u2013 heiUP, which is part of the university library. The publisher releases quality-controlled scientific publications in open access.\n\n\n\n### Facilities abroad[edit]\n\n\nHeidelberg University founded a Center for Latin America in Santiago, Chile in 2001.[49] It has the task of organizing, managing, and marketing the courses of study maintained either independently by Heidelberg University or in cooperation with the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile and the University of Chile. The center has responsibility for programs of postgraduate education. It also coordinates the activities of Heidelberg University in Latin America, and provides a platform for scientific cooperation.[49] Heidelberg University's South Asia Institute maintains branch offices in New Delhi (India)), Islamabad (Pakistan), Kathmandu (Nepal), and Colombo (Sri Lanka).[50]\n\n\nThe university is also represented by a liaison office in New York. Its main tasks include promoting existing collaborations, building up new networks, creating joint study programs, and maintaining and expanding academic contacts with American universities.[51]\n\n\n\n### Museum[edit]\n\n\nThe university has its own museum, in the main building of the old campus. Visitors are able to view the Great Hall (when not in use), and the former \"student jail\".[52]\n\n\n\n## Organization[edit]\n\n\n### Governance[edit]\n\n\nThe Rectorate is the 'executive body' of the university, headed by rector Bernhard Eitel. The rectorate consists of the chancellor, Holger Schroeter, who is the head of the central administration and responsible for the university's budgeting, and three pro-rectors, who are responsible for international relations, teaching and communication, and research and structure respectively.\n\n\nThe Senate is the 'legislative branch' of the university. The rector and the members of the rectorate are senators *ex officio*, as are also the deans of the faculties, as well as the medical and managing directors of the University Hospital, and the university's equal opportunities officer. Another 20 senators are elected for four-year terms, within the following quotas: eight university professors; four academic staff; four delegates of the student body; and four employees of the university administration.\n\n\nThe University Council is the advisory board to the aforementioned entities and encompasses, among others, the former Israeli Ambassador to Germany Avi Primor, as well as CEOs of German industries.[53]\n\n\n\n### Faculties[edit]\n\n\nAfter a 2003 structural reformation, the university consists of 13 faculties, which in turn comprise several disciplines, departments, and institutes. As a consequence of the Bologna process, most faculties now offer Bachelor's, Master's, and PhD degrees to comply with the new European degree standard. Notable exceptions are the undergraduate programs in law, medicine, dentistry and pharmacy, from which students still graduate with the State Examination, a central examination at Master's level held by the State of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg.\n\n\n\n* The Faculty of Behavioural Sciences and Empirical Cultural Sciences\n* The Faculty of Biosciences\n* The Faculty of Chemistry and Earth Sciences\n* The Faculty of Engineering[54]\n* The Faculty of Law\n* The Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science\n* The Faculty of Medicine\n* The Faculty of Medicine in Mannheim\n* The Faculty of Modern Languages\n* The Faculty of Philosophy and History\n* The Faculty of Physics and Astronomy\n* The Faculty of Theology\n* The Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences\n\n### Associated institutions[edit]\n\n\n* Network for Research on Ageing\n* Central Institute of Mental Health Mannheim\n* Heidelberg Center for American Studies\n* Heidelberg Institute for International Conflict Research,\n* Heidelberg State Observatory,[55]\n* University Hospital Heidelberg,\n* University Hospital Mannheim\n\n### Partnerships[edit]\n\n\nThe university has partnerships nationally and internationally. In particular, it maintains longstanding collaborations in research and education with the following independent research institutes located in and around Heidelberg:\n\n\n\n* Center for Jewish Studies Heidelberg\n* European Molecular Biology Laboratory\n* German Cancer Research Center (Helmholtz Association)\n* Heavy Ion Research Center Darmstadt (Helmholtz Association),\n* Heidelberg University of Education\n* Heidelberg Academy of Sciences\n* Karlsruhe Research Center (Helmholtz Association)\n* Max Planck Institute for Astronomy (Max Planck Society)\n* Max Planck Institute for Comparative Public Law and International Law (Max Planck Society)\n* Max Planck Institute for Medical Research (Max Planck Society)\n* Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics (Max Planck Society)\n\n## Academic profile[edit]\n\n\n### School statistics[edit]\n\n\nThe university employs more than 15,000 academic staff; most of them are physicians engaged in the University Hospital.[56] As of 2008, the faculty encompasses 4,196 full-time staff, excluding visiting professors as well as graduate research and teaching assistants. 673 faculty members have been drawn from abroad. Heidelberg University also attracts more than 500 international scholars as visiting professors each academic year. The university enrols a total of 26,741 students, including 5,118 international students. In addition there are 1,467 international exchange students at Heidelberg. 23,636 students pursue taught degrees, 4,114 of whom are international students, and 919 are international exchange students. 3,105 students pursue a doctoral degree, including 1,004 international doctoral students and 15 international exchange students. In 2007, the university awarded 994 PhD degrees.[39]\n\n\n\n### Rankings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| University rankings |\n| --- |\n| Overall \u2013 Global & National |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ***QS* World** 2024[57] | ![Fall](image)\u00a0=87 | ![Same position](image)\u00a03 |\n| ***THE* World** 2024[58] | ![Fall](image)\u00a047 | ![Same position](image)\u00a03 |\n| ***ARWU* World** 2023[59] | ![Rise](image)\u00a055 | ![Rise](image)\u00a01 |\n| ***QS* Europe**[*citation needed*] |  |  |\n| ***QS* Employability**[*citation needed*] |  |  |\n| ***THE* Employability**[*citation needed*] |  |  |\n\n |\n| By subject \u2013 Global & National |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ***QS* Natural Sciences** 2023[60] |  40 |  2 |\n| ***THE* Physical Sciences** 2023[61] |  =34 |  3 |\n| ***ARWU*** [*citation needed*] |  |  |\n| ***QS* Life Sciences and Medicine** 2023[60] |  39 |  1 |\n| ***THE* Life Sciences** 2024[61] |  32 |  1 |\n| ***ARWU* Clinical Medicine** 2023[62] |  17 |  1 |\n| ***QS*** [*citation needed*] |  |  |\n| ***THE*** [*citation needed*] |  |  |\n| ***ARWU*** [*citation needed*] |  |  |\n| ***QS*** [*citation needed*] |  |  |\n| ***THE*** [*citation needed*] |  |  |\n| ***ARWU*** [*citation needed*] |  |  |\n\n |\n\n\nThe University of Heidelberg has been consistently recognized in global and national university rankings. In the 2024 edition of the QS World University Rankings, Heidelberg ranked 87th globally and 3rd in Germany.[57] According to the 2024 Times Higher Education World University Rankings, the university was ranked 47th in the world and held the position as the 3rd best university in the country.[58] Moreover, in the 2023 ARWU World Rankings, Heidelberg secured the 55th position worldwide and was ranked first nationally.[59]\n\n\nAccording to the funding report of the German Research Foundation (DFG) of 2018, which breaks down the grants from 2014 to 2016, the Heidelberg University ranked 2nd among German universities in the overall ranking, 7th in humanities and social sciences and 4th among German universities in the life sciences and natural sciences. The approvals were normalised to the size of the university. In a competitive selection process, the DFG selects the best research projects from researchers at universities and research institutes and finances them. The ranking is thus regarded as an indicator of the quality of research.[63]\n\n\nIn the Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities (NTU ranking) 2019, which measures the research outputs of universities, Heidelberg University is ranked 1st in Germany and 5th in Continental Europe.[64]\n\n\nIn the CWTS Leiden Ranking 2019 Heidelberg University is ranked 1st in Germany and 13th in Continental Europe over all sciences according to the scientific impact (number of publications in core journals). According to the indicator \"Collaboration\", Heidelberg University is 1st in Germany and 10th in Europe.[65]\n\n\nRanked by the number of Nobel Laureates affiliated with the university at the time of Nobel Prize announcement, Heidelberg was placed 1st in Germany, 4th in Europe and 13th in the world by 2013.[66]\n\n\nAccording to the Third European Report on Science & Technology Indicators compiled by the European Commission, Heidelberg ranked 4th nationally and 9th in Europe.[67][68]\n\n\nThe German Center for Higher Education Development Excellence Ranking 2010, which measures academic performance of European graduate programs in biology, chemistry, economics, mathematics, physics, political sciences, and psychology, placed Heidelberg in the European excellence group for biology, chemistry, mathematics, physics, and psychology.[69]\n\n\nMeasured by the number of top managers in the German economy, Heidelberg University ranked 53rd in 2019.[70]\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

Organisation and length of courses[edit]\n\n\nThe academic year is divided into two semesters. The winter semester runs from 1 October to 31 March and the summer semester from 1 April to 30 September. Classes are held from mid-October to mid-February and mid-April to mid-July. Students can generally begin their studies either in the winter or the summer semester. However, there are several subjects students can begin only in the winter semester. The standard time required to finish a Bachelor's degree is principally six semesters, and a further four semesters for consecutive Master's degrees. The normal duration of PhD programmes for full-time students is 6 semesters. The overall period of study for an undergraduate degree is divided into two parts: a period of basic study, lasting at least four semesters, at the end of which students must sit a formal examination, and a period of advanced study, lasting at least two semesters, after which students take their final examinations.[71]\n\n\n\n### Admission[edit]\n\n\nIn the winter-semester 2006/2007, the university offered 3,926 places in undergraduate programs restricted by numerus clausus, with an overall acceptance rate of 16.3%.[72] Most selective are the undergraduate programs in clinical medicine, molecular biotechnology, political science, and law, with acceptance rates of 3.6%,[73] 3.8%,[72] 7.6%[74] and 9.1%[75] respectively. The selection is exercised by allocating the best qualified applicants to a given number of places available in the respective discipline, thus depending primarily on the chosen subjects and the grade point average of the Abitur or its equivalent. For some majors and minors in humanities\u2014particularly for conceptually non-vocational like classics and ancient history\u2014unrestricted admission is granted under certain criteria (e.g., relevant language proficiency), as applications regularly do not exceed the number of places available.\n\n\n\n![](image)The University Library's collection includes the Codex Manesse, an important German song manuscript of the Middle Ages.\nFor prospective international undergraduate students, a language test for German\u2014such as the DSH\u2014is required. Admission to consecutive Master's programs always requires at least an undergraduate degree equivalent to the German grade \"good\" (i.e., normally B+ in American, or 2:1 in British terms). Except for the Master's programs taught in English, a language test for German must be passed as well. PhD admission prerequisite is normally a strong Master's-level degree, but specific admission procedures vary and cannot be generalized.[76] International applicants usually make up considerably more than 20% of the applicant pool and are considered individually by the merits achieved in their respective country of origin.[77]\n\n\n\n### Finances[edit]\n\n\nThe German state heavily subsidizes university study to keep higher education affordable regardless of socio-economic background.[78]\nFrom 2007 to 2012, Heidelberg has charged tuition fees of approximately \u20ac1,200 p.a. for undergraduate, consecutive Master's, and doctoral programs, for both EU and non-EU citizens, and for any subject area. However, from spring term 2012 onwards, tuition fees have been abolished.[79] The usual housing costs for on-campus dormitories range from \u20ac2,200 to \u20ac3,000 p.a.[80]\n\n\nIn the fiscal year 2005, Heidelberg University had an overall operating budget of approximately \u20ac856\u00a0M, consisting of approximately \u20ac413\u00a0M government funds, approximately \u20ac311\u00a0M basic budget, and approximately \u20ac132\u00a0M from external grants. The university spent approximately \u20ac529\u00a0M in payroll costs and approximately \u20ac326\u00a0M in other expenditures.[81] Additionally, the university receives another \u20ac150\u00a0M in research grants, distributed over 5 years from 2012 onwards, due to the German Universities Excellence Initiative. In the fiscal year 2007, the university for the first time raised approximately \u20ac19\u00a0M through tuition fees, exclusively to further improve the conditions of study. Only approximately \u20ac9.5\u00a0M of these were spent at the end of the year and the rectorate had to urge the faculties to make use of their additional means.[82]\n\n\n\n### Research[edit]\n\n\nFile:Haus Buhl.jpgThe Center for Advanced Study Marsilius Kolleg, situated in House Buhl, was founded in 2007.\nAmong historical scientific achievements of Heidelberg researchers features prominently the invention of spectroscopy,[83] and of the Bunsen burner;[84] the discovery of chemical elements Caesium and Rubidium;[83] the identification of the absolute point of ebullition;[85] and the identification and isolation of nicotine as the main pharmacologically active component of tobacco.[86] Modern scientific psychiatry; psychopharmacology; psychiatric genetics;[11] environmental physics;[12] and modern sociology[13] were introduced as scientific disciplines by Heidelberg faculty. Almost 800 dwarf planets, the North America Nebula, and the return of Halley's Comet have been discovered and documented at institutes of the Heidelberg Center for Astronomy.[87] Moreover, Heidelberg researchers invented the process of plastination to preserve body tissue,[88] conducted the first successful transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells,[89] and recently developed a new strategy for a vaccination against certain forms of cancer, which earned Harald zur Hausen of the university the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2008.[90]\n\n\nToday, the university puts an emphasis on natural sciences and medicine, but it retains its traditions with highly ranked faculties of humanities and social sciences. The *Marsilius Kolleg*, named after Marsilius of Inghen, was established in 2007 as a Center for Advanced Study to promote interdisciplinary dialogue and research especially between the sciences and the humanities.[91] Other institutes such as the *Interdisciplinary Center for Scientific Computing*, the *Interdisciplinary Center for Neurosciences*, the *Heidelberg Center for American Studies*, and the *South Asia Institute* also build a bridge between faculties and thus emphasize the concept of a comprehensive university.\n\n\nNoted regular publications of the Center for Astronomy include the Gliese catalogue of nearby stars, the fundamental catalogues FK5 and FK6 and the annual published Apparent places, a high precision catalog with pre-calculated positions for over 3,000 stars for each day.[92] The Heidelberg Institute for International Conflict Research publishes the annual Conflict Barometer, which describes the recent trends in global conflict developments, escalations, de-escalations, and settlements.[93] Regular publications by the Max Planck Institute for International Law include the *Heidelberg Journal of International Law*, the *Max Planck Yearbook of United Nations Law*; the *Journal of the History of International Law*; the *Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law*; and the semi-annual bibliography *Public International Law*.[94]\n\n\nThe German Research Foundation (DFG) currently funds twelve long-term Collaborative Research Centers (SFB) with a duration of up to 12 years at Heidelberg,[95] four Priority Programs (SPP) with a duration of six years, two Research Units (FOR) with a duration of up to six years, as well as numerous individual projects at the university's faculties and institutes.[96] As a result of the German Universities Excellence Initiative, two Clusters of Excellence are funded with \u20ac6.5\u00a0M each\u2014\"*Cellular Networks: From Molecular Mechanisms to Quantitative Understanding of Complex Functions*\",[97] and \"Asia and Europe in a Global Context\".[98]\n\n\n\n### International cooperations[edit]\n\n\nHeidelberg is a founding member of the League of European Research Universities, the Coimbra Group, and the European University Association. The university forms part of the German-Japanese University Consortium HeKKSaGOn, and it participates in 7 European exchange schemes for researchers and students, such as ERASMUS. Furthermore, it is actively involved in the development of the German-speaking Andr\u00e1ssy University of Budapest, and co-runs the school of German law at the Jagiellonian University of Krak\u00f3w.[99] The city of Heidelberg being twinned with Cambridge, England, and Montpellier, France, there are close academic ties to the University of Cambridge and the Universit\u00e9 de Montpellier. Beyond Europe, the university and its faculties maintain specific agreements with 58 partner universities in Africa, the Americas, Asia, Australia and the Russian Federation. In total, the Higher Education Compass of the German Rector's Conference lists staff and student exchange agreements as well as research cooperations with 236 universities worldwide. Some of the most notable partner universities include Cornell University, Duke University, Georgetown University, Harvard University, Paris Institute of Political Studies (Sciences Po), Pantheon Sorbonne University, University of Cambridge, University of Oxford, Tsinghua University, and Yale University.[100]\n\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Students rowing on the Neckar river\nThe university offers a broad variety of athletics, such as teams in 16 different court sports from American football to volleyball, courses in 11 different martial arts, 26 courses in physical fitness and body building, 9 courses in health sports from aquapower to yoga, and groups in 12 different dance styles. Moreover, equestrian sports, sailing, rowing, skiing in the French Alps, track and field, swimming, fencing, cycling, acrobatics, gymnastics, and much more. Most of the sports are free of charge.[101] Heidelberg's competition teams are particularly successful in soccer, volleyball, equestrian sports, judo, karate, track and field, and basketball. The University Sports Club men's basketball team, USC Heidelberg, is the championship record holder, won 13 national championships, and is the only university team playing at a professional level in the second division of Germany's national league.[102]\n\n\n\n### Groups[edit]\n\n\nMoreover, the university supports a number of student groups in various fields of interest. Among them are four drama clubs, the university orchestra Collegium Musicum, four choirs, six student media groups, six groups of international students, nine groups of political parties and NGO's, several departments of European organizations of students in certain disciplines, four clubs dedicated to fostering international relations and cultural exchange, a chess club, a literature club, two debate societies (one focused on English debating, the other focused on German debating), one student consulting group, and four religious student groups. Student unions structure themselves as \"Studierendenrat\" (Student body council) as well as on department level.[103]\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nHeidelberg's student newspaper \"*ruprecht*\" is\u2014with editions of more than 10,000 copies\u2014one of Germany's largest student-run newspapers. It was recently distinguished by the MLP Pro Campus Press Award as Germany's best student newspaper. The jury of journalists from major newspapers commended its \"well balanced, though critical attitude\" and its \"simply great\" layout that \"suffices highest professional demands.\" The ruprecht is financed entirely by advertising revenues, thus retaining independence from university management. Some renowned journalists emerged from *ruprecht*'s editorial board.[104]\n\n\nHowever, the critical online student newspaper *UNiMUT*, which is run by the joint student council of the faculties, criticized the *ruprecht* often for being conformed, and exceedingly layout-oriented.[105]\n\n\nHeidelberg is also home of Germany's oldest student law review *Heidelberg Law Review*. The journal is published quarterly, at the beginning and end of each semester break, and is circulated throughout all of Germany.[106]\n\n\n\n### Studentenverbindung[edit]\n\n\nHeidelberg hosts 34 student corporations, which were largely founded in the 19th century. Corporations are to some extent comparable to the fraternities in the US. As traditional symbols (couleur) corporation members wear colored caps and ribbons at ceremonial occasions (*Kommers*) and some still practice the traditional academic fencing, a kind of duel, to \"shape their members for the challenges of life.\" In the 19th and early 20th century, corporations played an important role in Germany's student life. Today, however, corporations include only a relatively small number of students. Their self-declared mission is to keep academic traditions alive and to create friendships for life. The corporations' often representative 19th-century mansions are present throughout the Old Town.\n\n\n\n### Nightlife[edit]\n\n\nHeidelberg is not least famous for its student night life.[107] Besides the various parties regularly organized by the student councils of the faculties, the semester opening and closing parties of the university, the dormitory parties, and the soir\u00e9es of Heidelberg's 34 student fraternities, the city offers night life for any taste and budget.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Notable alumni[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Heidelberg University people\n\n* ![Pope Pius II](image)\n\nPope Pius II\n* ![Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel](image)\n\nGeorg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel\n* ![Robert Schumann](image)\n\nRobert Schumann\n* ![Dmitri Mendeleev](image)\n\nDmitri Mendeleev\n* ![Ludwig Feuerbach](image)\n\nLudwig Feuerbach\n* ![Max Weber](image)\n\nMax Weber\n* ![Hirata Tosuke](image)\n\nHirata Tosuke\n* ![Carl Spitteler](image)\n\nCarl Spitteler\n* ![Arnold J.

Somerset Maugham\n* ![Helmut Kohl](image)\n\nHelmut Kohl\n\n\nAlumni and faculty of the university include many founders and pioneers of academic disciplines, and a large number of internationally acclaimed philosophers, poets, jurisprudents, theologians, natural and social scientists. 33 Nobel Laureates, at least 18 Leibniz laureates, and two \"Oscar\" winners have been associated with Heidelberg University. Nine Nobel laureates received the award during their tenure at Heidelberg.[66]\n\n\nBesides several federal ministers of Germany and prime ministers of German states, five chancellors of Germany have attended the university, the latest being Helmut Kohl, the \"Chancellor of the Reunification\". Heads of state or government of Belgium, Bulgaria, Greece, Nicaragua, Serbia, Thailand, a British heir apparent, a secretary general of NATO and a director of the International Peace Bureau have also been educated at Heidelberg; among them Nobel Peace laureates Charles Albert Gobat and Auguste Beernaert. Former university affiliates in the field of religion include Pope Pius II, cardinals, bishops, and with Philipp Melanchthon and Zacharias Ursinus, two key leaders of the Protestant Reformation. Outstanding university affiliates in the legal profession include a president of the International Court of Justice, two presidents of the European Court of Human Rights, a president of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, a vice president of the International Criminal Court, an advocate general at the European Court of Justice, at least 16 justices of the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany, a president of the Federal Court of Justice, a president of the Federal Court of Finance, a president of the Federal Labor Court, two attorneys general of Germany, and a British law lord. In business, Heidelberg alumni and faculty notably founded, co-founded or presided over ABB; Astor corporate enterprises; BASF; BDA; Daimler AG; Deutsche Bank; EADS; Krupp AG; Siemens and Thyssen AG.\n\n\nAlumni in the field of arts include classical composer Robert Schumann, philosophers Ludwig Feuerbach and Edmund Montgomery, poet Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff and writers Christian Friedrich Hebbel, Gottfried Keller, Irene Frisch, Heinrich Hoffmann, Sir Muhammad Iqbal, National Hero of the Philippines Jos\u00e9 Rizal, W. Somerset Maugham, Jean Paul, Literature Nobel laureate Carl Spitteler, and novelist Jagoda Marini\u0107. Amongst Heidelberg alumni in other disciplines are the \"Father of Psychology\" Wilhelm Wundt, the \"Father of Physical Chemistry\" J. Willard Gibbs, the \"Father of American Anthropology\" Franz Boas, Dmitri Mendeleev, who created the periodic table of elements, inventor of the two-wheeler principle Karl Drais, Alfred Wegener, who discovered the continental drift, as well as political theorist Hannah Arendt, gender theorist Judith Butler, political scientist Carl Joachim Friedrich, and sociologists Karl Mannheim, Robert E. Park and Talcott Parsons.\n\n\nPhilosophers Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Karl Jaspers, Hans-Georg Gadamer, and J\u00fcrgen Habermas served as university professors, as did also the pioneering scientists Hermann von Helmholtz, Robert Wilhelm Bunsen, Gustav Robert Kirchhoff, Emil Kraepelin, the founder of scientific psychiatry, and outstanding social scientists such as Max Weber, the founding father of modern sociology.\n\n\nPresent faculty include Medicine Nobel Laureates Bert Sakmann (1991) and Harald zur Hausen (2008), Chemistry Nobel Laureate Stefan Hell (2014), seven Leibniz laureates, former justice of the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany Paul Kirchhof, and R\u00fcdiger Wolfrum, the former president of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea.\n\n\n\n## In fiction and popular culture[edit]\n\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\nIn 1880 Mark Twain humorously detailed his impressions of Heidelberg's student life in *A Tramp Abroad*. He painted a picture of the university as a school for aristocrats, where students pursued a dandy's lifestyle, and described the great influence the student corporations exerted on the whole of Heidelberg's student life.[108]\n\n\nIn William Somerset Maugham's 1915 masterpiece novel *Of Human Bondage*, he described the one-year stay of the protagonist Philip Carey at Heidelberg University, in a largely autobiographical way. Heidelberg also featured in the respective film versions of the novel, released in 1934 (starring Leslie Howard as Philip, and Bette Davis as Mildred), 1946 (with Paul Henreid and Eleanor Parker in the lead roles), and 1964 (with Laurence Harvey and Kim Novak in the lead roles).[109]\n\n\nE. C. Gordon, the hero of Robert Heinlein's 1964 novel *Glory Road*, mentions his desire for a degree from Heidelberg and the dueling scars to go with it.\n\n\nIn Bernhard Schlink's semi-autobiographical 1995 novel *The Reader*, Heidelberg University is one of the main scenes of Part II. Nearly a decade after his affair with an older woman came to a mysterious end, Michael Berg, a law student at the university, re-encounters his former lover as she defends herself in a war-crimes trial, which he observes as part of a seminar. The university is also featured in the Academy Award-winning 2008 film version The Reader, starring Kate Winslet, David Kross and Ralph Fiennes.[110][111]\n\n\n\n### Film and television[edit]\n\n\nThe 1927 silent film *The Student Prince in Old Heidelberg*, based on Wilhelm Meyer-F\u00f6rster's play *Alt Heidelberg* (1903), starring Ram\u00f3n Novarro and Norma Shearer, continued Mark Twain's image of Heidelberg, showing the story of a German prince who comes to Heidelberg to study there, but falls in love with his innkeeper's daughter. Having been very popular in the first half of the 20th century, it presents the typical student life of the 19th and early 20th century, and it is today considered a masterpiece of the late silent film era.[112] MGM's 1954 color remake *The Student Prince*, featuring the voice of Mario Lanza, is based on Sigmund Romberg's operetta version of the story.[113]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of medieval universities\n* Mannheim University of Applied Sciences for jointly run programs\n* Rhine Neckar Metropolitan Area\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Mission Statement\". *uni-heidelberg.de*.

Founded in 1419,[3][4][5] it is the third-oldest university in Germany. It is the oldest university in continental northern Europe and the Baltic Sea area,[5] and 8th oldest in Central Europe.[6] It was the 5th university established in the Holy Roman Empire.\n\n\nThe university has been associated with four Nobel laureates: Albrecht Kossel, Karl von Frisch, Otto Stern, and Walter H. Schottky. It is a member of the European University Association. According to a ranking published by *Times Higher Education* in 2018, it is the most beautiful university in Germany and the fourth most beautiful university in all of Europe.[7] The language of instruction is usually German and English for some postgraduate studies.\n\n\n\n![](image)Detail of the central building depicting the coat of arms of Mecklenburg-Schwerin\n![](image)Memorial stone to the foundation of Rostock University, quadrangle of Wittenberg University\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### 1419\u20131919[edit]\n\n\nThe university was founded in 1419 by confirmation of Pope Martin V and thus is one of the oldest universities in Northern Europe.\n\n\nIn Germany, there are only five universities that were founded earlier, while only Heidelberg and Leipzig operated continuously since then: Heidelberg (1386), Cologne (1388), Erfurt (1392/1994), W\u00fcrzburg (1402/1582) and Leipzig (1409).\nThat makes Rostock University the third oldest German university in continuous operation.\n\n\nThroughout the 15th and 16th centuries, the University of Rostock had about 400 to 500 students each year and was among the most important universities in Germany and Northern Europe at the time, with many of its students originating from the Low Countries, Scandinavia or other countries bordering the Baltic Sea.\n\n\nIn the course of political struggles and due to pressure from the church, the university moved to Greifswald in 1437 and remained there until 1443. From 1487 to 1488 teaching took place in L\u00fcbeck. A few years after the city of Rostock, the university became Protestant in 1542. Henceforth, Humanism and Lutheranism were defining characteristics of the university.\n\n\nIn the 16th century, Rostock was the first university to teach Copernicanism, which was introduced by Professor Duncan Liddel.[8] After the Thirty Years' War (1618\u20131648), however, for about two centuries the University of Rostock played only a regional role. After the \"ownership\" of the university had moved from the city to the state (Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin) in 1827, however, things changed for the better. The second half of the 19th century saw generous building activity in Rostock's *alma mater* and the university soon regained its old reputation amongst German universities.\n\n\n\n### 1919 to present[edit]\n\n\nOn the occasion of the 500th anniversary of the university, Albert Einstein and Max Planck received honorary doctorates on 12 November 1919. This made the University of Rostock the world's first institute of higher learning to award this honour to Einstein. The doctorate was not revoked during the Nazi rule in Germany (1933\u20131945), despite such orders by the Nazis. The reason for this remains unknown. Psychologist David Katz and professor of dentistry and dean of the medical faculty Hans Moral\u00a0[de] lost their posts in 1933 among others.\n\n\nThe end of the Second World War in 1945 brought many changes. The university, now finding itself in the Soviet Zone of Germany (the later German Democratic Republic), was re-opened on 24 February 1946. The Faculty of Law was closed in 1951, a Faculty of Agriculture was introduced in 1950 and in 1951 saw the opening of a Department of Shipbuilding (renamed Faculty of Technology in 1963). The University of Rostock was the first traditional university in Germany to open a technical faculty. In 1952, the Faculty of Aviation was opened, but eventually relocated to Dresden.\n\n\nIn 1976 the university was renamed Wilhelm-Pieck-Universit\u00e4t after Wilhelm Pieck, the first president of the German Democratic Republic. The renaming was annulled after the German reunification.\n\n\nExternal funding increased by 83\u00a0% between 2005 and 2010 alone and currently is above 47\u00a0million Euros per year. Over 500\u00a0million Euros have been invested in the university infrastructure since 1991, reaching 750\u00a0million Euros by 2015. The numbers of young people from Germany and of international students who choose Rostock as a place to study are increasing every year. As of today, students from at least 99 different countries have studied at Rostock. In 2007, the University of Rostock reorganized its research capacities into three profile lines: *Life, Light & Matter*, *Maritime Systems*, and *Aging of Individuals and Societies*. In 2010, a fourth profile was added, called *Knowledge \u2013 Culture \u2013 Transformation*.\n\n\n\n## Organization and structure[edit]\n\n\nLike many continental European universities, the University of Rostock is divided into academic faculties (German: *Fakult\u00e4t*). Those can be sub-divided into academic departments (German: *Institut*) and chairs (German: *Lehrstuhl*).\n\n\n\n### Faculties[edit]\n\n\nIt is divided into the following nine faculties:\n\n\n\n* **Faculty of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences**\n\t+ Plants and Soil\n\t+ Ecology and (Coastal)-Landscape\n\t+ Biomass, Aqua and Livestock Sciences\n* **Faculty of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering**\n\t+ Institute of Computer Science\n\t+ Institute for Visual and Analytic Computing\n\t+ Institute of Electrical Engineering\n\t+ Department of Computational Engineering\n* **Faculty of Law**\n\t+ Department of Law\n\t+ International Commercial Law\n\t+ International Business Administration\n* **Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Marine Technology**\n\t+ Mechanical Engineering\n\t+ Marine Technology\n\t+ Mechatronics\n\t+ Biomedical Technology\n* **Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences**\n\t+ Institute of Biology\n\t+ Institute of Chemistry\n\t+ Institute of Mathematics\n\t+ Institute of Physics\n* **Interdisciplinary Faculty**\n\t+ Department of Life, Light and Matter\n\t+ Department of Maritime Systems\n\t+ Department of Knowledge \u2013 Culture \u2013 Transformation\n\t+ Department of Ageing of Individuals and Society\n* **Faculty of Medicine**\n\t+ Albrecht Kossel Institute for Neuroregeneration\n\t+ General Medicine\n\t+ Dental Medicine\n\t+ Anatomy\n\t+ Medical Biotechnology\n\t+ Informatics in Medicine and Gerontology\n\t+ Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology\n\t+ Experimental Surgery\n\t+ History of Medicine\n\t+ Immunology\n\t+ Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine\n\t+ Medical Biochemistry and Molecular Biology\n\t+ Medical Biology\n\t+ Medical Genetics\n\t+ Medical Microbiology\n\t+ Medical Psychology and Sociology\n\t+ Pathology\n\t+ Pharmacology and Toxicology\n\t+ Physiology\n\t+ Proteome Center Rostock\n\t+ Forensic Medicine\n\t+ Transfusion Medicine\n\t+ Institute of Experimental Gene Therapy and Tumor Research\n\t+ Cell Biology\n* **Faculty of Theology**\n\t+ Institute of Image Theory\n\t+ Institute of Text and Culture\n* **Faculty of Humanities**\n\t+ Institute of General and Social Pedagogy\n\t+ Institute of Educational Psychology Rosa and David Katz\n\t+ Institute for School Pedagogy and Educational Research\n\t+ Institute for Elementary School Pedagogy\n\t+ Institute for Special Education Development and Rehabilitation\n\t+ Institute for Vocational Education\n\t+ Institute for English/American Studies\n\t+ Institute for German Studies\n\t+ Institute for Romance Studies\n\t+ Heinrich Schliemann Institute of Classical Studies\n\t+ Historical Institute\n\t+ Institute for Media Research\n\t+ Institute of Philosophy\n\t+ Institute of Sports Science\n\t+ Wossidlo Research Center for European Ethnology/Folklore\n\t+ Moritz Schlick Research Center\n\t+ Uwe Johnson Research Center\n\t+ Research and Documentation Center of the State of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania on the History of Dictatorships in Germany\n* **Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences**\n\t+ Institute of Business Administration\n\t+ Institute of Marketing and Services Research\n\t+ Institute of Sociology and Demography\n\t+ Institute of Political and Administrative Sciences\n\t+ Institute of Economics\n\n## Facilities[edit]\n\n\n### Rostock University Library[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Michaeliskloster, part of the Rostock University Library (Special Historical Library Collections)\nThe Rostock University Library consists of 3 divisional libraries and several specialized libraries provides scientific literature and information for research, education and study. The university statistics shows about 3 million physical volumes recorded in the catalogue. It provides access to electronic journals (EZB) and specialized databases (DBIS). The library possesses large special collections of culturally historical and scientifically historical old books.[9] In the Patents and Standards Centre (PNZ), all DIN norms and regulations as well as the VDI guidelines are provided.[10] Moreover, the library also contains the university archive and the art treasure collection.[11]\n\n\n\n### Rostock Student Services[edit]\n\n\nThe Rostock Student Services (German: *Studentenwerk Rostock*) provides accommodation for newly arrived international students who plan to study at the University of Rostock and the Rostock University of Music and Theatre. International students, who have not lived or studied in Germany, are considered for a Starter Package service. However, short-time students and students on a programme (ERASMUS; Sokrates) are given a low priority.[12]\n\n\n\n### Rostock University Hospital[edit]\n\n\nThe university operates a hospital, which has several teaching and research institutes.[13] Among those are the Albrecht Kossel Institute for Neuroregeneration.\n\n\n\n## Points of interest[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The *Rostocker Pfeilstorch*, on display at the Institute of Zoology\n* Botanischer Garten Universit\u00e4t Rostock, the university's botanical garden\n* Zoological Collection Rostock, founded in 1775 by Oluf Gerhard Tychsen.

Today it houses the rector's office and some parts of the university administration as well as a baroque assembly hall.\n![](image)Greifswald's red town hall, the seat of the lord mayor, is situated in the historic city centre. As Greifswald is a small, coastal student town, the relationship between the university and the town has mostly been close. For instance, it was Heinrich Rubenow, then lord mayor of the city, who pushed for the establishment of a university in his town, and who became the university's first rector in the year 1456.\nThe **University of Greifswald** (German pronunciation: [\u02c8\u0261\u0281a\u026afsvalt]; German: *Universit\u00e4t Greifswald*), formerly known as \"Ernst-Moritz-Arndt University of Greifswald\", is a public research university located in Greifswald, Germany, in the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.\n\n\nFounded in 1456 (teaching existed since 1436[2]), it is one of the oldest universities in Europe, with generations of notable alumni and staff having studied or worked in Greifswald. As the fourth oldest university in present Germany, it was temporarily also the oldest university of the Kingdoms of Sweden (1648\u20131815) and Prussia (1815\u20131945), respectively. Approximately two-thirds of the 10,179[4] students are from outside the state, including international students from 90 countries all over the world. Due to the small-town atmosphere, the pronounced architectural presence of the alma mater across town, and the young, academic flair in the streets, Greifswald is often described as a \"university with a town built around it\" rather than a town with a university. Being a vast research community, the university aims at expanding its academic connections globally.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### 1456\u20131600: Founding[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

This was possible due to the great commitment of Greifswald's lord mayor, Heinrich Rubenow, who was also to become the university's first rector, with the support of Duke Wartislaw IX of Pomerania and Bishop Henning Iven of the local St Nicolas' Cathedral. The founding took place in the local cathedral, which was later remodeled by Caspar David Friedrich and his brother and can still be visited today. The founding of the university was made possible by a decree that restricted teaching activity at the University of Rostock (founded 1419). Several professors left Rostock for Greifswald to continue their work there, where Heinrich Rubenow took the chance of establishing his own university. Originally, the university consisted of the four traditional divisions: Theology, Philosophy, Medicine and Law.\n\n\nIn the late Middle Ages the University of Greifswald was one of the most important centers of science in the Duchy of Pomerania. The rest of Pomeranian schools \u2013 including those in Szczecin and Stargard \u2013 did not have the university status in this time. Nowadays in Germany, there are only three older universities by count of the years of existence: the University of Heidelberg (established 1386), the University of Leipzig (1409), and the University of Rostock (1419).\n\n\nInternational co-operation with other institutions of higher education in northern Europe existed already in the earliest years, sparked and accelerated by the transnational trading network Hanse. From 1456 until 1526, 476 Scandinavians were enrolled at Greifswald University and 22 faculty members as well as six rectors came from Scandinavia. This was a relatively high percentage compared to the total number of students at the time. Sources suggest a relatively segregated life of Swedish students in the primarily German university though.\n\n\n\n![](image)Johannes Bugenhagen during a sermon (part of an altar triptych in Wittenberg's church)\nThe early sixteenth century saw significant co-operation of the university, the Lutheran church, the city and the Duchy of Pomerania. Professors of theology simultaneously served as pastors in the three cathedrals. Professors of medicine usually served as personal physicians of the duke. Professors of law were also working at the local courts while professors of the faculty of philosophy usually taught the sons and daughters of the ducal family. The landed nobility also funded university-related purposes such as scholarships and student bursaries.\n\n\nThe Reformation was introduced at the university in 1539. Johannes Bugenhagen, an alumnus of the university, was an important figure during the German and Scandinavian reformation as well as a good friend of Martin Luther. After the secularisation of the monastery at Eldena near Greifswald, Duke Philipp I of Pomerania gave all revenue created by the now secularised *Amt Eldena* to the university. His successor, Duke Ernst Ludwig, began the construction of a college building, which could only be completed after his death. Duke Philipp Julius presented the university a gown that was used by the rector on ceremonial occasions up until very recently.\n\n\n\n### 1600\u20131815: Sweden[edit]\n\n\nIn 1604, the Greifswald University Library became the first centralised university library in Germany. The university signed a contract with a book printer from Wittenberg, Germany, for the amount of 2,000 Gulden. This contract lasted nearly a century due to the disruption caused by the Thirty Years' War (1618\u20131648). Hence, the university now owns prestigious early prints of authors and printers such as Johannes Gutenberg or Thomas Thorild. The phrase *cuius regio, eius religio* as applied to the outcome of the Protestant Reformation is attributed to the early seventeenth century jurist Joachim Stephani (1544\u20131623) of the University of Greifswald.[6]\n\n\nThe Duke of Pomerania was in financial troubles and had not paid the professors. As a solution, he gave the Amt Eldena to the university \u2013 a total of 140 square kilometres of land.\n\n\nAfter the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 the western part of Pomerania, including Greifswald and its university, became a fief held by Sweden. From 1806 to 1815 it was formally a part of Sweden. Without entirely losing its character as a German university, it was heavily influenced by Swedish educational policies until 1815. Especially during the second half of the eighteenth century Greifswald was a cultural and scientific bridge between Germany and Sweden. More than 1,500 Swedes studied at Greifswald University.\n\n\nThe first university course in the English language in Germany was held in Greifswald in the year 1777.\n\n\nThe main administrative building \u2013 still in use today \u2013 was built during the \"good old Swedish years\" by Andreas Mayer, a mathematician by profession, in the style of North German Baroque.\n\n\n\n### 1815\u20131933: Prussia[7][edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

Prussia recognised the potential of science and universities, thus extensive building activity and growing financial support enabled the University of Greifswald to grow further both in size and reputation.\n\n\nIn 1856, on the occasion of the 400th anniversary of the university's founding, a monument was unveiled in the presence of King Frederick William IV of Prussia. The monument is still at its place, and was carefully restored for the 550th anniversary in 2006.\n\n\nThe Faculty of Law became *Faculty of Law and Economics* when an economic department was introduced in 1905. In 1912, Otto Jaekel, a professor of paleontology in Greifswald, founded the German Paleontological Society. The *Department of Modern Languages* was established in 1853. To commemorate the 400th anniversary of the university in 1856, the \"Rubenow-Denkmal\" (Rubenow Memorial) was built in front of the main building, which is still there at its historic place. The *Department of History* was founded in 1863 as the first in Prussia and the fourth in all of Germany. The painter Caspar David Friedrich was born in Greifswald and received his first painting instruction by one of the university's members. Today the *Department of Fine Art and Art History* is named after him. He later painted several oil paintings with motifs from the region, including the one on the left.\n\n\nThe spectrum of academic research and teaching was further expanded during the Weimar Republic. The Nordisches Institut (Scandinavian and Finno-Ugric studies) and several other research institutes, e.g. for biological research, Christian archeology, and Palestinian studies, were founded.\n\n\n\n### 1933\u20131945: Nazi Germany[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University education in Nazi Germany\n\nIn 1933 the university was named after Ernst Moritz Arndt, who was a student of theology in 1791 and later taught history at Greifswald. Here, he published his works \"*Versuch einer Geschichte der Leibeigenschaft in Pommern und R\u00fcgen*\", \"*Germanien und Europa*\" as well as the first part of \"*Geist der Zeit*\". The name was suggested by SA and Nazi Party member professor Walther Glawe.[8] The university was gleichgeschalted and reformed according to military needs of the Nazis.[9]\n\n\n\n### 1945\u20131990: GDR[edit]\n\n\n![](image)University of Greifswald, Old Campus\n![](image)The main building on 8 October 1956, a few days before the 500th anniversary celebrations of the university\nAll academic activities came to a halt towards the end of the Second World War, and the university was re-opened on 15 February 1946. The name of Ernst Moritz Arndt was initially removed but restored in 1954. Several organisational changes were made during the time of the GDR, most of which were revoked in the 1990s after the German Reunification.\n\n\n\n### 1990\u2013present: Germany[edit]\n\n\nFreedom of science as well as the autonomy and self-administration of the university were re-established. The Faculty of Law and Economics was re-opened from 1991 to 1993. Extensive renovation took place since 1990. The dinosaur Emausaurus was named after the acronym of the university (*E*rnst-*M*oritz-*A*rndt-*U*niversit\u00e4t Greifswald) in 1990.\n\n\nBeginning in 1999, the University of Greifswald was among the first in Germany to welcome and introduce the international Bachelor/Master degree system as proposed by the Bologna declaration. The new system has replaced all former 4\u00bd-year \"Magister\" degrees in the arts and humanities and is set to replace the 4\u00bd-year \"Diplom\" formerly awarded in the sciences and in business too.\n\n\nIn 2006, the university celebrated its 550th anniversary with a large variety of events. The central ceremony \u2013 involving the re-opening of the university's renovated administrative building by President Horst K\u00f6hler of Germany, Queen Silvia of Sweden, and Minister President Harald Ringstorff of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern \u2013 took place on 17 October 2006.[10]\n\n\nSince the end of the GDR the University of Greifswald has undergone major construction efforts. Between 1991 and 2007, more than 417 million euros were spent on the careful renovation of historic buildings, as well as on the construction of new sites. For instance, 19th century lecture hall (\"auditorium maximum\") has been carefully restored,[11][12] just like the university's main administrative building and many other buildings in the historic center of town. A new campus for natural sciences (physics,[13] chemistry, biochemistry), medicine, IT and mathematics is under construction in the eastern part of the city. The new domiciles of Greifswald University Library, the departments of physics, biology and biochemistry have already been completed. The university hospital, which is thought to be completed in 2009, will be the most up-to-date full-scale hospital in Germany, adding to the appeal of the Greifswald Medical School. As a consequence of the construction of the new Greifswald University Hospital building, all historic 19th and early 20th century buildings that were formerly used by the hospital will be transferred to house other disciplines, thus creating an old-town campus for such departments as law and economics, the humanities and social sciences, and improving research and teaching considerably. As one of only 17 out of a total of 52 proposed building projects of \"national significance\" across Germany, the national government has agreed to subsidise the construction of a new pharmacology research lab (in Germany, education is usually cared for by the German states and not by the national government, which only supports a few projects of national and international importance).[14]\n\n\nFounded in 2000, the Alfried-Krupp Kolleg promotes the Universities international relations by awarding fellowships to Junior and Senior Fellows.[15]\n\n\nFollowing debates about the appropriateness of having the university named after Ernst Moritz Arndt, in January 2017 the Senate voted to remove his name from the official name of the university.[16] Although the State of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern declared this decision void, a compromise was reached in which Arndt's name is removed from the official name, but can still be used under certain circumstances. As of June 2018 the name \"Ernst-Moritz-Arndt Universit\u00e4t Greifswald\" is no longer in use.[17]\n\n\n\n## Organisation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The *Universit\u00e4tshauptgeb\u00e4ude* (university main building) \u2013 the seat of the rector and the administration\n### Central governance[edit]\n\n\nThe Rectorate, consisting of the rector, three pro-rectors, and the registrar, represents the university as a whole, sets the main guidelines development, distributes the finances, opens and closes study programmes, and appoints professors.[18] The registrar is the head of the university administration, and manages the university's budget. The rector is elected by the Senate for a four-year term, the registrar for an eight-year term, and the three pro-rectors are elected to serve for two years.\n\n\nThe Senate is the second governing institution of the university.[19] The Senate elects the Rectorate, and is itself elected by the members of the university, i.e. by students and members of staff. Senators serve for two years, student senators for one year. The Senate consists of academic staff members (divided into professors and non-professors), students, and non-academic staff members (librarians, administration officials, etc.).\n\n\n\nMoreover, there is a University Council (*Universit\u00e4tsrat*), consisting of six prominent members of the public who are elected by the Senate to advise the university in various ways.[20]\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe old campus with its many ivy-covered historic buildings was mostly built during the Swedish and Prussian era, and the newly built Physics Dept is an example of the growing new science campus. As more and more departments and clinics of the medical faculty and the faculty of natural sciences and mathematics move to new science campus, many of the skillfully built historic buildings in the city centre are renovated and prepared for use by the other faculties. The construction and renovation activities are scheduled to be completed by 2014.\n\nThe Student's Union (AStA) and the Student Parliament (StuPa) represent the interests of the students.\n\n\n\n### Faculties[21][edit]\n\n\nThe buildings of the arts and humanities, law, business studies, and theology are scattered about the historic centre of the town of Greifswald. The newly built facilities for the natural sciences, mathematics, medicine, pharmacy, dentistry are situated to the east of the city centre, offering first-class research opportunities. Like many European universities, the University of Greifswald has five faculties (German: **Fakult\u00e4t**) which are structured into departments, institutes, and chairs.\n\n\n\n#### Arts and Humanities[22][edit]\n\n\nMain article: University of Greifswald Faculty of Arts\n\n* Sacred Music and Music\n* Fine Art\n* German\n* History\n* Modern Languages (including English, Baltic Languages, Scandinavian Languages and Slavic Languages)\n* Philosophy\n* Political and Communication Science\n* Education\n\n\n#### Law and Economics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University of Greifswald Faculty of Law and Economics\nDue to an education reform from 2013 in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Law can only be taught at the University of Greifswald. The Faculty of Law in Rostock had to be closed.[23]\nUndergraduate degree courses offered at the Faculty of Law and Economics include Business Administration, Law and Management and Law.[24] Master students can enroll for courses such as Health Care Management and Business Administration.[25]\n#### University Medicine[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: University of Greifswald Faculty of Medicine and Greifswald University Hospital\n\nThe Medical Faculty at the University of Greifswald is among the best-ranked in Germany and the admission requirements are among the highest in Germany. Courses are offered in Human Medicine and Dentistry.\n\n\n\n#### Mathematics and Natural Sciences[edit]\n\n\nCourses are offered in biology, chemistry, biochemistry, geography, geology, Mathematics, IT, pharmacy, psychology and physics.\n\n\nThe physics department of the University of Greifswald, together with the Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Plasmaphysik and the Leibniz Institute of Plasma Research and Technology, is a major international research hub in the field of plasma physics, attempting to solve future energy problems with the research reactor Wendelstein 7-X.\n\n\nSince 2007, the Department of Physics takes care of the construction of a space telescope called *MuSTAnG*[26] (Muon Spaceweather Telescope for Anisotropies at Greifswald), which will be part of a worldwide network of telescopes in Japan, Brazil, Australia and Germany. The telescope will enable physicists and astrononomers at Greifswald University to forecast solar activity and has been co-funded by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Deutsches Zentrum f\u00fcr Luft- und Raumfahrt. In addition to MuSTAnG, the university owns an observatory, which is taken care of by a private initiative and open to the public.\n\n\nGreifswald offers two multi-disciplinary approaches to environmental studies, called landscape ecology and environmental sciences bringing together different disciplines such as biology, geography, economics, law, and ethics.\n\n\nThe pharmacy department and the biotechnology department are also in the top group in Germany. The government-funded National Research Centre for Animal Disease on the Isle of Riems co-operates loosely with the university and is named *Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut* in honour of the university's former member of staff, Friedrich Loeffler.\n\n\nThe University of Greifswald owns a field station on the German island of Hiddensee.[27]\n\n\nScientists from the university names a species of freshwater snail, *Opacuincola gretathunbergae,* after the climate activist Greta Thunberg.[28]\n\n\n\n#### Theology[edit]\n\n\nThe faculty of theology was founded when the university was founded in 1456. Notable theologians have studied or worked here, for example Johannes Bugenhagen who was a close friend of Martin Luther.\n\n\n\n### Library[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The new library is one of the constituent buildings of Greifswald University Library.\nGreifswald University Library traces its roots back to the year 1456. In 1604, the first centralised university library in Germany was founded in Greifswald. Today, there are two main libraries, the Central University Library is situated on the Beitzplatz Campus and the Departmental Library can be found on the Loefflerstra\u00dfe Campus. In addition to the main libraries, several departments and institutes have their own libraries (German: *Fachbibliothek*).\n\n\n\n### Academic year[edit]\n\n\nAs is customary in Germany, the academic year is divided into two semesters. The \"winter term\" (*Wintersemester*) lasts from October to March, and the \"summer term\" (*Sommersemester*) from April to September.[29] During the winter term, teaching usually takes place from mid-October to the end of January \u2013 the remainder being reserved for exams and the writing of term papers. Teaching during the summer term lasts from mid-April to mid-July.[29]\n\n\n\n## Cooperation[edit]\n\n\nAside from teaching and research, one of major tasks of the university is cooperation with partners outside the actual university.\n\n\n\n### Research partners[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Alfried Krupp Institute of Advanced Study (left)\nThe university's research emphasis lies in the field of plasma physics, landscape ecology, medicine, biotechnology, the Middle Ages and the languages and cultures of countries bordering the Baltic Sea.\n\n\n\n* Alfried Krupp Institute of Advanced Study (Krupp-Kolleg)\n* Biotechnikum Greifswald\n* Friedrich Loeffler Institute (National Research Institute of Animal Diseases), Riems Island (FLI)\n* Leibniz Institute of Plasma Research and Technology (LIPT)\n* Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics\n* Nuclear fusion research reactor Wendelstein 7-X\n* Diabetes Research Centre, Karlsburg (near Greifswald)\n* Siemens Public Networks, Greifswald\n* Technology Centre Vorpommern\n* Technologiepark (under construction)\n\n\n### International cooperation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)International Office (blue), Departments of Baltic and Slavic studies (grey)\nThe University of Greifswald aims to extend and efficiently use its international contacts. The primary geographic focus of international collaboration is Northern Europe and Eastern Europe, which is due to the university's research focus in this area. Partnerships with foreign universities to foster exchange of people (staff and students alike) and ideas is conducted in two different ways. Firstly, through official partnership agreements with foreign universities, which involves the entire university and most or all of her disciplines. Secondly, through contacts of professors, departments, and schools, which usually involves only one or few disciplines.\n\n\nStudent exchange from and to Greifswald is co-ordinated by the university's international office (**Akademisches Auslandsamt**). The University of Greifswald has signed several official partnership agreements with other universities to foster international co-operation through faculty and student exchange and academic co-operation.[30] In Northern Europe, the university has signed partnership agreements with universities in Denmark (\u00c5rhus, Holb\u00e6k), Finland (Joensuu and Kuopio), and Sweden (Lund). In Eastern Europe, partnership agreements have been signed with universities in the Czech Republic (Brno), Estonia (Tartu), Latvia (Riga), Lithuania (Vilnius, Klaipeda), Poland (Poznan, Szczecin), and Russia (Kaliningrad, Saint Petersburg). Exceptions are the University of Aberdeen as one of the ancient universities of Scotland, and the University of Padua in Italy.[31] The university has also signed various cooperation agreements with universities outside of Europe, e.g. the University of South Australia, the University of Newcastle, Australia, Widener University in Pennsylvania, the University of Manitoba and the University of Saskatchewan (Canada), the National University of Singapore (humanities) or Berkeley (humanities) and the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign (United States).[32]\n\n\nIn addition to official partnership agreements (see above) on the university level, there also numerous other channels of international contact on the level of chairs, departments or academic faculties, which often also include student exchange through the ERASMUS programme. Co-operation of this kind takes place with numerous prestigious universities, including those in Barcelona, Bergen, Gothenburg, Graz, Copenhagen, Lancaster, Oslo, Prague, Reykjav\u00edk, Stockholm, Southampton, Uppsala or Utrecht.[31]\n\n\n\n### Public events[edit]\n\n\nThe university and its research partners regularly organise events for the general public, in the form of lecture series or public discussions. There is an annual \"children's university\" week as well as a family university, in which current trends in research are presented in a more popular form. Every semester, the student union organises a \"24-hour lecture\", in which university researchers, politicians, students and others present topics in short lectures starting at 6 pm on a Friday, and ending at 6 pm on the following Saturday.\n\n\n\n### Museums and university collections[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Croy tapestry\n![](image)A pond at Greifswald Botanic Garden and Arboretum\nUntil post-World War II communist land reforms, the University of Greifswald was a large scale land owner and one of the wealthiest universities in Germany. It owned over 140 square kilometres of arable land, the revenue of which was the basis for its financial independence and wealth. Parts of the land that the university previously possessed have been given back to the university since the German reunification, but some claims are still pending in court. Today, the university again manages some of the land previously owned, including a large forest near Eldena that is open to the public, but the revenue is low compared to other sources of funding. The university-owned forest is administered by university foresters.[33]\n\n\nThe former affluence of the university can still be seen in many historic buildings as well as a notable collection of art and other possessions. The university has some its artworks and possessions on display in museums across the country. Ernst Bogislaw von Cro\u00ff donated the Croy Tapestry, a tapestry depicting the Reformation from 1554. The university also owns one of only four remaining 36-line Gutenberg Bibles from the year 1458. The university owns various paintings and other artworks as well as a great number of historic books, some of which are lent for exhibition to independent public museums. The University of Greifswald runs Greifswald Botanic Garden.[34] It also has a few collections, some of which are open to visitors:\n\n\n\n* Anatomical Collection (*Anatomische Sammlung*)\n* Archeological Collection (*Arch\u00e4ologische Studiensammlung*); Christian Archeological Collection (*Christlich-arch\u00e4ologische Sammlung*)\n* Botanical Garden (*Botanischer Garten*)\n* Neonatological and Gynecological Collection (*Geburtshilflich-gyn\u00e4kologische Sammlung*)\n* State Geological Collection (*Geologische Landessammlung*)\n* Graphic Collection (*Graphische Sammlung*)\n* Gustav Dalman Collection (theology) (*Gustav-Dalman-Sammlung*)\n* Herbarium\n* Collection of Historic Maps (*Historische Kartensammlung*)\n* History of Medicine Collection (*Medizinhistorische Sammlung*)\n* Coin Collection (*M\u00fcnzsammlung*)\n* Pathological Collection (*Pathologische Sammlung*)\n* Collection of Physics Appliances (*Physikalische Ger\u00e4tesammlung*)\n* Computer Collection (*Rechentechnische Sammlung*)\n* Collection of Pre-historic Antiquities (*Sammlung vorgeschichtlicher Altert\u00fcmer*)\n* Zoological Museum (*Zoologisches Museum*)\n\n\n## Statistics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Scientists at the Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Plasmaphysik in Garching and Greifswald are researching fusion reactor technology and are constructing Wendelstein 7-X.\n### Admission[edit]\n\n\nA number of subjects at the University of Greifswald are among the most selective in Germany for undergraduate admissions (e.g. see here for the medical school). A number of other subjects such as the languages and cultures of Northern Europe and the Eastern Europe, philosophy, European history, physics, biochemistry, fine arts, church music have also continually achieved national and international recognition.\n\n\nMoreover, the University of Greifswald is frequently described as one of the most popular universities for undergraduate admission in Germany, which is due to a very good study environment as well as a co-operative spirit between the teaching staff and students.[35] Due to its small size, with only 10,179 students,[36] the university is comparable to other small universities such as St Andrews or Yale.\n\n\n\n### Rankings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| University rankings |\n| --- |\n| Overall \u2013 Global & National |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ***QS* World**[*citation needed*] |  |  |\n| ***THE* World** 2024[37] |  401-500 |  37-41 |\n| ***ARWU* World**[*citation needed*] |  |  |\n| ***QS* Europe**[*citation needed*] |  |  |\n| ***QS* Employability**[*citation needed*] |  |  |\n| ***THE* Employability**[*citation needed*] |  |  |\n\n |\n\n\nIn the Times Higher Education World University Rankings of 2024, the university is placed at 401-500th globally and 37-41st within the country.[37]\n\n\nToday, the continued efforts to regain academic leadership are mirrored in national top placements, e.g. in the 2009 *Die Zeit* university ranking,[38] in several subjects including for instance biology (2009[39]), medicine (2009[40]), geography, law (2008[41]) pharmacy, psychology, dentistry (2009[42]), and business administration (2008[43]).\n\n\n\n### Student body[edit]\n\n\nIn the autumn of 2009, there were 12,500 students enrolled in Greifswald, i.e. a quarter of the town's total population of 53,000 were students. According to a 2008 study, Greifswald is Germany's 'youngest city',[44] having the highest percentage of households by people under 30 years of age. In 2008, 59.4 percent of all students were female, the remaining male. Two-thirds of the enrolled students in 2009 came to Greifswald from outside the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, and 5.3 percent were foreign nationals.[45]\n\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\nGreifswald is situated in close proximity to the sea (near the islands R\u00fcgen and Usedom), about 200\u00a0km to the north of Germany's capital city, Berlin, and 100\u00a0km east of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern's largest city, Rostock. There are train connections, and high-speed autobahn links to Hamburg, Rostock, and Berlin.\n\n\nThe city of Greifswald has several museums, a theatre and a philharmonic orchestra as well as a breadth of sports clubs and societies. A medium-sized convention centre called *Stadthalle Greifswald* exists.\n\n\nAccording to a 2009 study, 44% of all people in Greifswald use their bicycle for daily transport, which is the highest such rate in Germany.[46]\n\n\n\n### Athletics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe Ryck river is a popular place for rowing, canoeing, and angling. Sailboats can reach the city centre via the Ryck. The path on the southern side of the river is good for walking, cycling, or jogging from the city centre to the seaside area, *Wieck*, and vice versa. A ship in the port of Greifswald \u2013 Greifswald is situated between the islands of Usedom and R\u00fcgen, one of the best sailing areas of Germany.\n\nThe university's *Hochschulsport*[47] (college sports) offers a wide range of opportunities to students who wish to do sports. Courses are available in nearly all disciplines, for instance aerobics, American football, football (soccer), dragon boat, fencing, handball, judo, karate, canoeing, lacrosse, rugby, surfing, diving, taekwondo, tennis, table tennis, volleyball or yoga. The regular local sports clubs are frequented by students, too.\n\n\nGreifswald is situated near the sea and the area between isles of R\u00fcgen and Usedom is among the most picturesque and best sailing and yachting regions in the whole of Germany. It is renowned for its steady winds.\n\n\nThere are a number of sailing and yachting clubs that are frequented by staff and students alike. There are two Sailing Clubs especially for students, the Studentischer Regattaverein, founded in 2007, which offers its Members a wide Range of Sailing Boats to take part in Regattas like Star, J/24, OK Dinghy, Europe, Vaurien, H Dinghy and a Nacra 5.0.[48] The other one, being the oldest Sailing Club in Greifswald, is the *Akademischer Seglerverein* (Academic Sailing Club).[49]\n\n\nThere is a golf club called *Hanseatischer Golfclub*[50] which is popular with university staff and students alike. It hosts the annual *Moritz Golf Cup*.\n\n\n\n### Activities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The old student cafeteria (*Mensa*) building, which also contains a not-for-profit student club\nThe student-run, not-for-profit clubs *Mensaclub*, *Geographenkeller*, *Geologenkeller*, *Club 9* and *Kiste* are very popular and provide an inexpensive way of going out and meeting other students. There are several movie clubs who regularly show movies in German, English or in other languages. Apart from the localities that are run by students, there is an abundance of different pubs, clubs and restaurants.\n\n\nFor those wishing to attend music events, there are a number of concerts (rock, pop, etc.) in local pubs and venues throughout the year, as well as the annual \"Bach Festival\" called *Greifswalder Bachwoche*[51] and the philharmonic concerts, open air operas and concerts, operas, theatre performances, and ballet are offered by the Theater Vorpommern.[52]\n\n\nPopular destinations for water- and beach-related activities during the summer are the nearby spa towns on the isles of R\u00fcgen and Usedom, e.g. Binz, Sellin, Heringsdorf. The coast of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is one of the most popular summer tourist destinations in Germany.\n\n\nThere is also a small beach in Greifswald-Eldena. The *Stadtpark* (city park) is situated to the northeast of the city centre next to a small zoo. The *Ryck* river crosses the city, and is only a 2-minute walk from the central market square. There are old boats, a pedestrian bridge and a few bars at the riverbank, which is full of students in the summer.\n\n\nPeople who enjoy being outdoors make use of the fact that three of Germany's 14 national parks \u2013 Jasmund, M\u00fcritz and Vorpommersche Boddenlandschaft \u2013 can be reached within one hour or less from Greifswald.\n\n\n\n### Housing[edit]\n\n\nAs is customary at German universities, students are generally required to arrange for their own housing. There are a few low-rate student dorms in the town, however a large majority of students share private flats with a couple of other students (German: *Wohngemeinschaft*, abbreviated *WG*), or live in single apartments. In recent years, it has become increasingly difficult for newly matriculated students to find appropriate flats in Greifswald, which is due to a growing number of students and a stagnating market. As landlords often prefer their prospective tenants to be fluent in German, this may cause disadvantages for international students wishing to rent their own place. However, the university usually arranges dorm rooms for international students.\n\n\n\n![The historic market square with its pubs, caf\u00e9s, and restaurants \u2013 the core of the city centre \u2013 is a popular place on a sunny day.](image)\nThe historic market square with its pubs, caf\u00e9s, and restaurants \u2013 the core of the city centre \u2013 is a popular place on a sunny day.\n\n### Societies[edit]\n\n\nAs in any other university town, there are groups and organisations of various colours, e.g. human rights groups, political or religious youth organisations, environmental protection groups, and the like. There is a local ESN chapter for international students. GrIStuF[53] \u2013 Greifswald International Students Festival \u2013 brings together students from all over the world each summer to discuss, party and compete with each other.\n\n\nThe AStA and the student parliament (*StuPa*) work to represent the interests of all students towards the university and society as a whole.\n\n\nThe following music groups are open to faculty and students, e.g.\n\n\n\n* chamber choir\n* cathedral choir\n* university big band[54]\n* university choir\n* university symphonic orchestra\n\n\nNordischer Klang[55] (*Nordic Sound*) \u2013 an international festival of Scandinavian and Nordic culture \u2013 takes place each year in Greifswald and is actively supported by students and members of staff. *Nordischer Klang* introduces the cultures of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden to the German public and is the largest festival of Nordic culture outside of the Nordic countries. It comprises lectures, movies, theatre performances, live jazz music, fine art and literature.\n\n\nPolenmARkT[56] (*PolandmARkeT*) is a German-polish festival taking place every November in the Hanseatic city Greifswald. It was created in 1997 to connect Germany and Poland \u2013 mainly in cultural aspects. It is organized by the PolenmARkT e.V. (an association) and a pool of volunteers. It was supported by the Embassy of Poland, the city Greifswald, the University of Greifswald and its students. Looking back at a 14-year-long period of growth it is one of the most important cultural events in the Hanseatic city. The organiserrs managed to establish the event sustainable into Greifswald's citizens interests.\n\n\nThere is a monthly student magazine called *moritz-Magazin*,[57] which read by the majority of students and publishes stories not only about university politics but also about culture in general. A popular *radio98eins*[58] local/regional radio station is operated mainly by students and presents independent music and local news. Students who wish to get experience in television may want to join *moritzTV* the student TV channel.\n\n\n\n### Fraternities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Academic fencing, ca. 1900\nGreifswald has a number of different student fraternities and sororities, which are called *Studentenverbindungen* (the singular is *Studentenverbindung*). *Studentenverbindungen* have a long tradition as most of them were founded in the 19th century, and they are to some extent comparable to the fraternities in the United States. As traditional symbols (couleur) corporation members wear coloured caps and ribbons at ceremonial occasions (Kommers) and some still practice the traditional academic fencing, a kind of duel, in order to \"shape their members for the challenges of life\". In the 19th and early 20th century, corporations played an important role in Germany's student life. Today, however, corporations include only a relatively small number of students. Their self-declared mission is to keep academic traditions alive and to create friendships for life. The political views of the fraternities are more or less conservative, but two of them (Rugia and Markomannia) have been linked to the far-right NPD.\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of University of Greifswald people, Category:University of Greifswald alumni, and Category:Academic staff of the University of Greifswald\n\n![](image)Prince Bernhard von B\u00fclow\u2014Chancellor of the German Empire from 1900 to 1909\u2014Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany, and Rudolf von Valentini (left to right) on board *SMY Hohenzollern* in 1908\n![](image)Johannes Bugenhagen (1485\u20131558) \u2013 religious reformer in North Germany, Denmark and Norway; friend of Martin Luther.\nThe University of Greifswald is associated with a number of notable people, including both former students and faculty. For instance, 17th century lawyer David Mevius,\ntwo Nobel prize laureates as well as two German chancellors have studied or worked in Greifswald.\n\n\nJohannes Stark (1874\u20131957) received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1919 (see Nobel Prize Website) \"for his discovery of the Doppler effect in canal rays and the splitting of spectral lines in electric fields\" during his time at the University of Greifswald. In 1939, Gerhard Domagk (1895\u20131964) received the Nobel Prize in Medicine (see Nobel Prize Website) \"for the discovery of the antibacterial effects of prontosil\". The university was named in honour of its former student and faculty member, the writer, politician and poet Ernst Moritz Arndt. Otto von Bismarck, chancellor of the German Empire from 1871 to 1890 and the \"engineer\" of the Unification of Germany in 1871, had a connection to Greifswald when he studied at the agricultural college, as well as one of his successors, Prince Bernhard von B\u00fclow, who was chancellor of the German Empire from 1900 to 1909.\n\n\nFranz Seldte, a chemist by profession, worked as German labour minister. Johannes Bugenhagen, who introduced the Reformation in much of Northern Germany and Scandinavia was a student at the University of Greifswald and Thomas Thorild, a Swedish poet spent parts of his life in Greifswald. Alfred Gomolka, Member of the European Parliament for the CDU, worked for the university as well as the mathematician Felix Hausdorff. Bernhard Windscheid is one of the fathers of present German civil law. Ferdinand Sauerbruch, Theodor Billroth, Johann Friedrich Dieffenbach and Friedrich Loeffler made important contributions to the field of medical science. Hermann L\u00f6ns became famous as a poet just like the discovers of Africa explorer Gustav Nachtigal became known around the world. Carl Schmitt, one of the most influential figures of 20th century political science was a member of staff. Mie scattering is named for Gustav Mie, a former professor of physics. Georg Friedrich Sch\u00f6mann, Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff were noted classical philologists. Ernst W. Mayr, one of the 20th century's most influential evolutional biologists, studied at the University of Greifswald.\n\n\nA number of public figures received honorary doctorates of the University of Greifswald, including Jacques Delors (former president of the European Commission) and Hannelore Kohl (wife of former German chancellor Helmut Kohl).\n\n\nThe University of Greifswald and her research partners have also been visited by a number of heads of states, including then-chancellor of Germany Gerhard Schr\u00f6der (2000,[59] 2001[60]), chancellor Angela Merkel (2010[61] and 2013[62]), presidents of Germany Roman Herzog (1997[63]), Horst K\u00f6hler (2006[64]), Joachim Gauck (2013[65]), and Queen Silvia of Sweden (2006[66]).\n\n\n\n## Quotes[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| *\"The University of Greifswald is one of those frequently mentioned 'flagships of science' in our country.\"*\n |\n| \u2013 The President of Germany, Horst K\u00f6hler, at the 550th anniversary celebrations in 2006[67] |\n\n\n* *If I look at the development of some of the universities [in the former eastern part] \u2013 for instance Greifswald, Dresden, and Jena \u2013 then we have achieved quite a lot.* (*German*: Wenn ich mir die Entwicklung einiger Universit\u00e4ten anschaue \u2013 etwa Greifswald, Dresden und Jena \u2013 dann sind wir da schon ein ganzes St\u00fcck weiter.)   \n \u2013 Bundespr\u00e4sident Johannes Rau on the development and education in the former GDR, 2004[68]\n* *Strong and self-confident universities are fountains of fortitude for a whole region, a whole country even, just as everyone can see it happen here in Greifswald.* (*German*: Starke, selbstbewusste Hochschulen sind Kraftquellen f\u00fcr eine ganze Region, ein ganzes Land.

The university was founded in 1457 by the Habsburg dynasty as the second university in Austrian-Habsburg territory after the University of Vienna. Today, Freiburg is the fifth-oldest university in Germany, with a long tradition of teaching the humanities, social sciences and natural sciences and technology and enjoys a high academic reputation both nationally and internationally. The university is made up of 11 faculties and attracts students from across Germany as well as from over 120 other countries. Foreign students constitute about 18.2% of total student numbers.[2]\n\n\nThe University of Freiburg has been associated with figures such as Hannah Arendt, Rudolf Carnap, David Daube, Johann Eck, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Friedrich Hayek, Martin Heidegger, Edmund Husserl, Herbert Marcuse, Friedrich Meinecke, Edith Stein, Paul Uhlenhuth, Max Weber and Ernst Zermelo. As of October 2020, 22 Nobel laureates are affiliated with the University of Freiburg as alumni, faculty or researchers, and 15 academics have been honored with the highest German research prize, the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize, while working at the university.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Foundation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Portrait of Archduke Albert VI of Austria, founder of the university\nOriginally Albrechts University, the university started with four faculties (theology, philosophy, medicine, and law). Its establishment belongs to the second wave of university foundings in the German-speaking world in the late Middle Ages, like the University of T\u00fcbingen and the University of Basel (Switzerland). Established by papal privilege (papal bull), the university in Freiburg actually was \u2013 like all or most universities in the Middle Ages \u2013 a corporation of the church body and therefore belonged to the Roman Catholic Church and its hierarchy. The bishop of Basel consequently was its provost or chancellor (*Kanzler*), the bishop of Constance was its patron, and the real founder of the university was the sovereign, Archduke Albert VI of Austria, being the brother of Frederick III, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation. At its founding, the university was named after Albert VI of Austria. He provided the university with land and endowments, as well as its own jurisdiction. Also he declared Albrechts University as the \"county university\" (German *Landesuniversit\u00e4t*) for his territory until it was handed over to the Austrian House of Habsburg in 1490.\n\n\nThe university soon attracted many students, such as the humanists Geiler von Kaysersberg, Johann Reuchlin, and Jakob Wimpfeling. When Ulrich Zasius was teaching law (until 1536), Freiburg became a centre of humanist jurisprudence. From 1529 to 1535, Erasmus of Rotterdam after having left Basel, lived and taught in Freiburg, however, never at the university.[3] From around 1559 on, the university was housed at the *Altes Collegium* (\"Old College\"), today called the \"new town-hall\". The importance of the university decreased during the time of the Counter-Reformation. To counter reformatory tendencies, the administration of two faculties was handed over to the Roman Catholic order of the Jesuits in 1620. From 1682 on, the Jesuits built their college, as well as the Jesuit church (nowadays the \"University Church\" or *Universit\u00e4tskirche*).\n\n\n\n### Studium Gallicum[edit]\n\n\nIn 1679, Freiburg temporarily became French territory, along with the southern parts of the upper Rhine. French King Louis XIV disliked the Austrian system and gave the Jesuits a free hand to operate the university. On 6 November 1684, a bilingual educational program was initiated. From 1686 to 1698, the faculty fled to Konstanz.\n\n\n\n### Austrian reforms[edit]\n\n\nAfter Freiburg was re-conquered and appointed as capital of Further Austria, a new time began for the university by the reforms of Empress Maria Theresa of Austria. The requirements for admission were changed for all faculties in 1767 (before that time only Roman Catholics were allowed to study) and Natural Sciences were added as well as Public Administration. Also in 1767, the university became a governmental institution despite the Church's protests. The Church finally lost its predominant influence on the university when the Jesuits were suppressed following a decree signed by Pope Clement XIV in 1773. Consequently, Johann Georg Jacobi (brother of the more famous philosopher Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi) in 1784 was the first Protestant professor teaching at the university in Freiburg.\n\n\nWhen Freiburg became a part of the newly established Grand Duchy of Baden (in German \"*Gro\u00dfherzogtum Baden*\") in 1805 (after Napoleon occupied the area of the formerly Further Austria), a crisis began for the university in Freiburg. Indeed, there were considerations by Karl Friedrich, Grand Duke of Baden and Karl, Grand Duke of Baden to close down the university in Freiburg while both of them thought that the Grand Duchy could not afford to run two universities at the same time (the Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg had existed since 1386).\n\n\n\n### University of Freiburg[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Freiburg around 1900\nThe university had enough endowments and earnings to survive until the beginning of the regency of Ludwig I, Grand Duke of Baden in 1818. Finally in 1820, he saved the university with an annual contribution. Since then, the university has been named Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg (*Albert-Ludwigs-Universit\u00e4t Freiburg*) as an acknowledgement of gratitude by the university and the citizens of Freiburg.\n\n\nIn the 1880s, the population of the student body and faculty started to grow quickly. The scientific reputation of Albert Ludwigs University attracted several researchers such as economist Adolph Wagner, historians Georg von Below and Friedrich Meinecke, and jurists Karl von Amira and Paul Lenel.\n\n\nIn 1900, Freiburg became the first German university to accept female students. Before there had been no women at German universities.\n\n\nIn the beginning of the 20th century, several new university buildings were built in the centre of Freiburg, such as the new main building in 1911. The university counted 3,000 students just before World War I. After World War I, the philosophers Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger (since 1928) taught at Albert Ludwigs University, as well as Edith Stein. In the field of social sciences, Walter Eucken developed the idea of ordoliberalism, which subsequently is known as the \"Freiburg School\".\n\n\n\n### Nazi Era[edit]\n\n\nSee also: University education in Nazi Germany\n\n![](image)Hermann Staudinger\nDuring the time of the Nazi dictatorship, the university went through the process of \"political alignment\" (*Gleichschaltung*) like the rest of the German universities. Under the rector Martin Heidegger, all Jewish faculty members were forced to leave the university in accordance with the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service. He also informed the Gestapo of the pacifist leanings of a distinguished Faculty member, Hermann Staudinger. The Nazi geneticist Eugen Fischer promoted racist views while a member of the university, ideas which were used to support the notorious Nuremberg laws passed by the Nazis.\n\n\n\n### Postwar years[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The University of Freiburg in 1961\nAfter World War II, the university was reopened. New buildings for natural sciences were erected in the *Institutsviertel* (\"institute quarter\").\nIn the postwar years, the ideas of ordoliberalism, developed earlier by economists of the Freiburg School, such as Walter Eucken, Franz B\u00f6hm, Hans Grossmann-Doerth, and Leonhard Miksch, drove the creation of the German social market economy and its attendant *Wirtschaftswunder*. Nobel Prize winner and former professor at the University of Freiburg, Friedrich Hayek, is also associated with this theory. He directed the Walter Eucken Institut, an economic think tank in Freiburg cooperating with the university. Arnold Bergstraesser, considered a founding father or German political science after World War II, was also a professor at the University of Freiburg. His research group later formed what is now the Arnold Bergstraesser Institute for sociocultural research at the university.\n\n\nIn the late 20th century, the university was part of a mass education campaign and expanded rapidly. The student body grew to 10,000 by the 1960s, and doubled to 20,000 students by 1980. In the 1970s, the faculty structure was changed to 14 departments, with the Faculty of Engineering becoming the 15th faculty in 1994. In 2002, the number of faculties was reduced to 11. The university opened a memorial dedicated to the victims of National Socialism among the students, staff, and faculty in 2003.[4]\n\n\nIn 2006, the University of Freiburg joined the League of European Research Universities (LERU). One year later, the university was chosen as one of nine German Universities of Excellence. However, it did not receive the third line of funding in 2012.\n\n\n\n### University seal[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The university seal is set into the floor at the entrance of the largest lecture hall \u2013 *auditorium maximum*.\nThe seal of the University of Freiburg depicts Christ seated on a gothic throne holding the gospel in his right hand with the temple curtain in the background. Christ offers the teachings of the gospel to the Jewish scholars who are crouched at his feet. To the left and right of Christ are structures resembling towers, most likely symbolic of the Temple of Jerusalem. Located to the right of Christ is the coat of arms of the Austrian duchies, a banner with five eagles. The shield on the opposite side symbolizes the coat of arms used by the Habsburgs in conjunction with their territories. The coat of arms of the city of Freiburg is located at the bottom of the seal, displaying St George's Cross. The Latin inscription on the seal reads *Sigillum universitatis studii friburgensis brisgaudie*. The seal was slightly modified in 1913, but has otherwise been in continuous use since it was adopted in 1462.[5]\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Kollegiengeb\u00e4ude I*, erected in 1913 as the main building of the university\nHaving grown with the city since the 15th century, the university's buildings are deeply intertwined with the city. The three large campuses are the university center next to the historical city center, the institutes quarter, and the engineering campus, but other buildings can be found scattered throughout Freiburg.\n\n\nThe university complex in the historical center of Freiburg contains such picturesque buildings as the Jugendstil *Kollegiengeb\u00e4ude I*, built in 1911 by Hermann Billing, and the gothic revival old university library. The current University Library is also located in the historical center; it is a monumental building erected in the 1970s, and was to be renovated and redesigned beginning in September 2008.[6] It is one of the largest in Germany and placed fourth in an October 2007, German national ranking of university libraries.[7]\n\n\nThe University Church, located across from *Kollegiengeb\u00e4ude II*, was built in 1683 by the Jesuit order. The church and the Jesuit college were handed over to the university after the Jesuit order was suppressed in 1773. The church was destroyed in the 27 November 1944, bombing raid on Freiburg, and reconstructed in 1956.[8]\n\n\nThe \"institute quarter\" (*Institutsviertel*) is home to the science faculties. This campus was destroyed almost completely in the Freiburg bombing raid in 1944. After World War II, the reconstruction of the institutes began. Today, the quarter houses the physics buildings, the tall main chemistry building, visible from afar, the famous Institute for Macromolecular Chemistry at the Hermann-Staudinger-Haus, various other science buildings, and the renowned preclinical institutes of the Faculty of Medicine.\n\n\nThe engineering campus is located next to the small Freiburg airfield to the northwest of the city center, close to the University Medical Center. The campus is home to the *Institut f\u00fcr Mikrosystemtechnik* ( Department of Microsystems Engineering) and the Department of Computer Science. With the addition of the Faculty of Engineering, the University of Freiburg became the first classical university to combine traditional disciplines with microsystems technologies.\n\n\nThe University Medical Center (*Universit\u00e4tsklinikum Freiburg*) is one of Germany's largest medical centers. It boasts 1,600 beds and handles 55,000 in-patients a year, with another 357,000 being treated as out-patients. It consists of 13 specialized clinics, five clinical institutes, and five centers (e.g. Center for Transplantation Medicine). The University Medical Center achieved many technical advances, such as the first implantation of an artificial heart *Jarvik 2000* in 2002.\n\n\nMost recently, the University of Freiburg purchased a large historic villa in the district of Herdern, which will house part of the literature and linguistics, as well as history departments of the Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies.\n\n\nIn 2015, the University of Freiburg opened its new library, housed in a modern building with a large glass and chrome facade. The library features a section for quiet work and the permanent collection as well as space for group work, where collaboration is encouraged. The building also includes a student cafe and an outdoor plaza with modern sculpture.\n\n\n\n* ![Aristotle, in front of Kollegiengeb\u00e4ude I](image)\n\nAristotle, in front of *Kollegiengeb\u00e4ude I*\n* ![Homer](image)\n\nHomer\n* ![Kollegiengeb\u00e4ude II and central university square](image)\n\n*Kollegiengeb\u00e4ude II* and central university square\n* ![University Church](image)\n\nUniversity Church\n* ![Kollegiengeb\u00e4ude IV, Humanities Faculty (former University Library)](image)\n\n*Kollegiengeb\u00e4ude IV*, Humanities Faculty (former University Library)\n* ![The University Library in Freiburg](image)\n\nThe University Library in Freiburg\n* ![The Department of Surgery at the University Medical Center](image)\n\nThe Department of Surgery at the University Medical Center\n* ![The Institute for Medical Ethics and History of Medicine and the Institute for Biostatistics and Medical Informatics at the Faculty of Medicine](image)\n\nThe Institute for Medical Ethics and History of Medicine and the Institute for Biostatistics and Medical Informatics at the Faculty of Medicine\n\n\n## Students and admission[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The green at the central *mensa* (cafeteria) on Rempartstra\u00dfe\nThe university has a combined undergraduate and graduate student population of around 21,600.[2] About 16% of these students are foreigners, from about 120 countries. Admission largely depends on the faculty and program applied for and is strictly merit based, with the average score of final secondary-school examinations (German *Abitur*) or A-levels playing an important role. Overall, in the fall of 2010, roughly 4,000 of around 26,000 applicants were admitted: this means that the university's acceptance rate that year was equal to 15.38%.[9]\n\n\nThe University of Freiburg offers a large variety of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral degree programs at its 11 faculties in 150 fields of study.[10]\n\n\nAs common among German universities, the academic year consists of summer and winter terms (semesters). The winter term runs from 1 October to 31 March, while the summer term runs from 1 April to 30 September. However, lectures and classes usually do not run for the full duration of these periods and allow for breaks in spring and fall.\n\n\nAs a German university, tuition is mostly free. The University of Freiburg currently has a semester fee of 155 EUR for all undergraduate and most graduate and doctoral programs, regardless of the EU or non-EU citizenship of students. Additionally, since autumn 2017, non-EU students are charged 1500 EUR tuition fee per semester.[11]\n\n\n\n### Student life[edit]\n\n\nNumerous student clubs and organizations are active, among them a campus radio station, echo-fm,[12] and a student television station, alma\\*,[13] which is also available as a podcast. Because of the nearby French and Swiss borders and the adjacent Black Forest, where the university owns a retreat on Schauinsland Mountain, fine opportunities exist for leisure and outdoor activities. Students come from Central and Eastern Europe for language studies, the majority demographic category is females in age range 18\u201325 (58%).\n\n\nThe university provides student housing in its various dormitories, run by the *Studentenwerk*. Additionally, further dormitories in Freiburg are operated by other institutions, such as the Catholic Archdiocese. Due to the affordable rent and limited spots, rooms in the various dormitories are very popular. Many students find private living arrangements, such as *Wohngemeinschaften* (shared apartments). However, the popularity of Freiburg for prospective students can make finding an apartment or room quite time-consuming, especially before the start of the academic terms.\n\n\nThe university has its own career center, singled out as one of the best in Germany by the *Stifterverband f\u00fcr die Deutsche Wissenschaft*.[14]\n\n\n\n## Academic profile[edit]\n\n\n### Excellence initiative[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\"*Die Wahrheit wird euch frei machen*\" (The truth will set you free)\nThe university scored well with its submissions to the German Universities Excellence Initiative. The university received funding in all three categories. In the first category, funding for a new graduate school, the Spemann Graduate School of Biology and Medicine, was granted; in the second, funding was granted for the excellence cluster Centre for Biological Signalling Studies (*bioss*); and in the third category, Institutional Strategy Line of Funding, open only to institutions with submissions qualified in the first two categories, the university is receiving funding for \"Windows for Research\", which aims to promote a high level of interdisciplinarity between research fields and attract scientists from all over the world. To that end, the university founded the Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies (FRIAS). Being selected for the third category ranks Freiburg as one of nine \"excellence universities\" in Germany. The university is to receive over EUR 130 million in additional funds over five years (from 2007) from this third category of funding.[15][16]\nIn 2009, the university was also successful in a nationwide competition for excellence in teaching, held by the *Stifterverband der deutschen Wissenschaft*. The University of Freiburg, with its plans for future innovative teaching concepts, was selected as one of 10 winners from a field of over 100 higher education institutions.[17]\n\n\nIn 2012, in the third round of the Excellence Initiative, the university was able to successfully extend funding for the Spemann Graduate School of Biology and Medicine, as well as *bioss*, while also gaining funding for a new cluster called BrainLinks-Brain Tools, an interdisciplinary neurotechnology project. Citing insufficient evidence of integration of the FRIAS concept into the university's framework, the committee did not extend funding for the FRIAS and the institutional strategy line of funding, despite acknowledging the impressive research and advances achieved at FRIAS in the past years.[18]\n\n\n\n### Rankings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| University rankings |\n| --- |\n| Overall \u2013 Global & National |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ***QS* World** 2024[19] |  192 |  9 |\n| ***THE* World** 2024[20] |  128 |  11 |\n| ***ARWU* World** 2023[21] |  101\u2013150 |  5 |\n| ***QS* Europe**[*citation needed*] |  |  |\n| ***QS* Employability**[*citation needed*] |  |  |\n| ***THE* Employability**[*citation needed*] |  |  |\n\n |\n\n\nThe University of Freiburg is recognized in several university ranking systems. In the QS World University Rankings 2024, it holds the 192nd position globally and the 9th position nationally.[19] The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2024 placed it 128th in the world and 11th in Germany.[20] The Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) 2023 ranks it between 101st and 150th globally, and 5th nationally.[21]\n\n\nIn university rankings published in 2007 and 2008 by German magazines and periodicals (*Der Spiegel, Die Zeit, Focus*, etc.[22][23]) the University of Freiburg has established itself as one of Germany's top universities.[24] The faculties for law, medicine, economics, history, English studies, German studies, biology, dentistry, and pharmacology achieve especially high scores.[25][26][27] In regards to the natural sciences, the University of Freiburg ranked sixth in Europe and second in Germany[28] in a ranking from 2003 of the European Commission of the universities according to their overall impact on scientific research. The Centre for Higher Education Development, a German higher education think tank, periodically publishes comprehensive rankings of European Master's and PhD programs. In 2016, Freiburg garnered five spots in the top Excellence Group among seven subject fields examined.[29] In a recent survey by the Nature Publishing Group, the *Nature Publishing Index \u2013 2012 Global Top 100*, the University of Freiburg was the highest-ranked German university and ranked 66th worldwide and 18th in Europe.[30] A recent study, \"Benchmarking China and Germany: An Analysis of Patent Portfolios of Universities and Research Organizations\", was published in May 2013 and sought to evaluate leading universities and research institutions in Germany and China in regards to their patent applications. The study placed the University of Freiburg as the third-most innovative university in Germany in terms of total patent applications.[31]\n\n\n\n#### By subject[edit]\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

academic competitions with considerable success. The moot court team of the Faculty of Law has been the most successful team in the history of the competition Willem C. Vis International Commercial Arbitration Moot. The humanoid robot team of the Faculty of Engineering regularly competes with distinction in international tournaments.[35] The University of Freiburg team has also repeatedly scored highly at the International Genetically Engineered Machine undergraduate synthetic biology competition held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.[36] The team was supported by numerous university institutions, among them the recently established *bioss* cluster of excellence. The University of Freiburg also participates in the National Model United Nations held annually in New York City.\n\n\nThe genetically engineered golden rice was developed by the University of Freiburg (Peter Beyer) and the ETH Zurich (Ingo Potrykus) from 1992 to 2000. It was considered a breakthrough in biotechnology at the time of publication and now can help to provide vitamin A to people lacking access to it in their diets.\n\n\nWhen previous rector J\u00e4ger retired in 2008, law professor Andreas Vo\u00dfkuhle was chosen as his successor. However, shortly after the start of his term, the Social Democratic Party of Germany nominated Vo\u00dfkuhle as vice-president of the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany. Vo\u00dfkuhle accepted the nomination, was confirmed, and took his seat on the court in May 2008. In July 2008, then vice-rector Hans-Jochen Schiewer was elected as successor to Vo\u00dfkuhle. Schiewer has assumed the position of rector with the start of the winter term 2008/2009.\n\n\nThe University of Freiburg offers educational audio and video contents on the iTunes U software platform since January 2008.\n\n\nThe University of Freiburg Institute of Physics is actively involved with research at the Large Hadron Collider and has contributed significantly to the ATLAS experiment, resulting in the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012.\n\n\n\n## Organization and faculties[edit]\n\n\nToday, about 430 professors, 3,695 academic employees, and 8,644 non-academic employees at the university are working for the Albert Ludwigs University, making it Freiburg's and the region's biggest employer. The university attracts many academics from abroad and was awarded excellent positions in the 2005 and 2009 *Humboldt Ranking*.[37][38]\n\n\n\n### Faculties[edit]\n\n\nThe university is headed by a rector and divided into 11 faculties:\n\n\n\n* Faculty of Theology\n* Faculty of Law\n* Faculty of Medicine\n* Faculty of Economics and Behavioural Sciences\n* Faculty of Philology\n* Faculty of Philosophy (history, sociology, etc.)\n* Faculty of Mathematics and Physics\n* Faculty of Chemistry, Pharmacy, and Geosciences\n* Faculty of Biology\n* Faculty of Forest and Environmental Sciences\n* Faculty of Engineering\n\n\n### University College Freiburg[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Logo at the entrance of University College Freiburg\nUniversity College Freiburg (UCF) is the university's central facility for promoting and administering international, interdisciplinary teaching activities. It was established in 2012 and is situated in the historical buildings of the old university, the historical site of the *artes liberales*. UCF serves as a lab for innovative teaching approaches and instructional design at the University of Freiburg and works in close co-operation with the faculties and the Rectorate's departments for Instructional Development and International Relations. It is accredited by the University of Freiburg, which draws its authority from the Central Evaluation and Accreditation Agency.[39]\n\n\nThe four-year, English-taught Bachelor program in Liberal Arts and Sciences (LAS) is UCF's major offering, the first of its kind in Germany. It emphasizes a broad interdisciplinary education, while at the same time providing for individualized academic concentrations on a high academic level. Students have to complete 240 ECTS credits and are able to major in life sciences, environmental and sustainability sciences, culture and history and governance. Electives can be taken at UCF, in the greater University of Freiburg, during studies abroad or in the form of internships and self-directed practical projects.[40]\n\n\nIn order to provide a framework and didactic guidance for interdisciplinary higher education, the University of Freiburg has established two chairs at UCF: Epistemology and Theory of Science (Prof. Dr. Frieder Vogelmann, who is also the Dean of Studies)[41] and Science and Technology Studies (Prof. Dr. Veronika Lipphardt).[42] The College and the program are directed by Managing Director Paul Sterzel and the Academic Coordinator Thorsten Leiendecker.\n\n\nUCF is a member of the European Colleges of Liberal Arts and Sciences and of EPICUR,[43] a group of eight universities in six countries that explore a modern and internationally connected university experience Students are able to participate in a double degree program with the University College Maastricht.\n\n\nStudents at UCF organize a number of interest groups, for instance a magazine publishing group, a 3D printing group, an arts collective, and a Model United Nations team.[44] They represented by an elected board of twelve student office holders.[45] Alumni are a part of a subgroup within the greater University of Freiburg alumni association.[46]\n\n\n\n### Graduate schools[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Freiburg has a variety of graduate education and research opportunities. In an evaluation of European graduate programs, Freiburg was ranked among the leading universities in several subject fields examined.[47][48]\n\n\nOne of the notable graduate opportunities is the Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies, a project funded by the German Excellence Initiative.\n\n\nApart from the many graduate programs of its faculties, Freiburg has set up additional specialized graduate schools and graduate research centers, coordinated by the newly founded International Graduate Academy (IGA) Freiburg. The IGA coordinates five graduate schools: the Spemann Graduate School of Biology and Medicine; the European Cultures and Intercultural Interweaving school; the Theology and Religious Studies school; the Hermann Paul School of Language Sciences, and the Environment, Society and Global Change graduate school of the Faculty of Forest and Environmental Sciences.\n\n\nThe IGA also coordinates 12 Graduate Research Centers (Graduiertenkolleg): Biochemistry of Enzymes; Friends, Patrons, Clients; Formation and Development of Present-Day Landscapes; Mathematical Logics and Applications; Mechanisms of Neuronal Signal Transduction; Catalysts and Catalytic Reactions for Organic Synthesis (in cooperation with the University of Basel); Hadron Collider Physics; Embedded Microsystems; From Cells to Organs: Molecular Mechanisms of Organogenesis; Signal Systems in Model Organisms of Plant Origin; Micro Energy Harvesting; and PhD program Computational Neuroscience at the Bernstein Center Freiburg for Computational Neuroscience and Neurotechnology.\n\n\nFinally, the university operates three joint graduate schools with the Max Planck Society: the International Max Planck Research School for Molecular and Cellular Biology; the International Max Planck Research School on Retaliation, Mediation and Punishment; and the International Max Planck Research School for Comparative Criminal Law.\n\n\nTogether with the EUCOR universities of Basel and Strasbourg and the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, the University of Freiburg also runs the shared graduate school \u00c9cole sup\u00e9rieure de biotechnologie Strasbourg, enabling the students to obtain an international degree in biotechnology and a trilingual education, as classes are taught in English, German, and French.\n\n\n\n### International language courses[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Freiburg has offered German language courses for foreign students since 1911. The courses take place at the university's Language Teaching Centre ('Sprachlehrinstitut') during the semester breaks and attract students from over 50 nations.. The intensive language lessons are bolstered by a supplementary program with lectures and seminars on German culture, politics, philosophy, and art, as well as excursions to the Black Forest, the Alsace region in France, Basel (Switzerland) or Lake Constance. In addition to classes for all language levels, professional German courses (e.g. business German) are also offered.\n\n\n\n## Sustainability[edit]\n\n\nThe city of Freiburg is known for its environmentally friendly policies and focus on renewable energy and sustainability, attracting solar industry and research to the city. This environmentally conscious attitude also extends to the University of Freiburg which has founded the work group \"Nachhaltige Universit\u00e4t Freiburg\" (Sustainable University of Freiburg) and has drawn up environmental guidelines to be implemented in university practice.\n\n\nThe university has also founded the initiative Solar-Uni Freiburg in 2007, with the aim of further expanding its capabilities in sustainability and environmental research. Solar panels were installed on the roofs of university buildings. To bundle renewable energy research and teaching at the university, the Center for Renewable Energy (ZEE, Zentrum f\u00fcr Erneuerbare Energien), an interdisciplinary and cross-faculty facility, was founded. Aside from research in the fields of solar energy, biomass, geothermal energy, energy efficiency and new energies, an international Master of Science degree in Renewable Energy Management is being offered.\n\n\nIn addition to its own expertise, the Center for Renewable Energy can draw upon the support of the renewable energy industrial sector in Freiburg, as well as the university's cooperation with other research institutes in the area, such as the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE, the \u00d6ko-Institut \u2013 Institute for Applied Ecology, or the University of Applied Sciences Offenburg.\n\n\n\n## University cooperation[edit]\n\n\n### Local partner institutions[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Freiburg cooperates closely with external research institutions located in Freiburg, several of which are connected with chairs at the university.[49]\n\n\nCollaborating institutions include:\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| * the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Scientific Community Kiepenheuer-Institut f\u00fcr Sonnenphysik\n* the Bernstein Center Freiburg\n* the Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics\n* the Max Planck Institute for the Study of Crime, Security and Law (formerly known as Max Planck Institute for Foreign and International Criminal Law)\n* the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, Fire Ecology Research Group\n* the Arnold Bergstraesser Institute for Socio-Cultural Research (ABI)\n | * the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Solid-State Physics\n* the Fraunhofer Institute for High-Speed Dynamics (Ernst-Mach-Institut)\n* the Fraunhofer Institute for Physical Measurement Techniques\n* the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems\n* the Fraunhofer Institute for Mechanics of Materials\n* the Confucius Institute\n* the Walter Eucken Institut\n |\n\n\n### International cooperation[edit]\n\n\nThe university is part of the regional EUCOR federation together with the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, the universities of Basel, Mulhouse, and, marked by particularly close ties, Strasbourg.[50] Freiburg is further a member of the League of European Research Universities; the European University Association; ASEA-Uninet; AC21; and the International Forum of Public Universities (IFPU). The university also has exchange agreements and cooperative efforts with renowned universities on almost every continent.\n\n\nThe University of Freiburg initiated an English language international master's program in social sciences, the Global Studies Programme (GSP) in 2001. The aim of the program is to enable students to study social sciences in different regions and cultures. Combining various disciplines such as sociology, political sciences, anthropology and geography, students approach globalization with a unique perspective. The program is conducted jointly by the University of Freiburg with the University of Cape Town in Cape Town, South Africa, the Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, India, the Latin American Social Sciences Institute in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and the Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, Thailand. Students in the GSP master's program study on three different continents during the two-year degree program. Since 2008, the GSP also offers a PhD program in Global Studies. The Global Studies Program has received many awards, among them the BMW Group Award for Intercultural Learning in 2004 as well as being listed a Top Ten International master's degree Course in Germany by the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) in 2006.[51]\n\n\nIn 1995, the University of Freiburg helped the Aromanian professor Vasile Barba\u00a0[bg] found the European Center of Aromanian Studies (Aromanian: *Tsentrul European ti Studii Arm\u00e3neshti*; German: *Europ\u00e4isches Zentrum f\u00fcr Aromunische Studien*), specialized on Aromanian studies.[52]\n\n\nThe university also supports the Institute for Russian-German Literature and Cultural Relations at the Russian State University for the Humanities as well as the Vladimir Admoni School for Doctoral Studies at the University of Latvia.\n\n\nApproximately 1/6th of its students are international students. Many students at this university participate in the ERASMUS exchange program.\n\n\n\n## Notable alumni and professors[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of University of Freiburg people\n\nPerhaps best known amongst the alumni of the university are Joseph Goebbels, Martin Heidegger, Edmund Husserl, Hannah Arendt, Paul Ehrlich, Hans Krebs, Hans Spemann, Ethel Dench Puffer Howes, and Friedrich Hayek.\n\n\nAmong the affiliates are numerous Nobel laureates and Leibniz Prize winners.\n\n\n\n* ![Konrad Adenauer](image)\n\nKonrad Adenauer\n* ![Johann Eck](image)\n\nJohann Eck\n* ![Walter Eucken](image)\n\nWalter Eucken\n* ![Harald zur Hausen](image)\n\nHarald zur Hausen\n* ![Friedrich Hayek](image)\n\nFriedrich Hayek\n* ![George de Hevesy](image)\n\nGeorge de Hevesy\n* ![Edmund Husserl](image)\n\nEdmund Husserl\n* ![Hans Krebs](image)\n\nHans Krebs\n* ![Herbert Marcuse](image)\n\nHerbert Marcuse\n* ![Heinrich Rickert](image)\n\nHeinrich Rickert\n* ![Rudolph Sohm](image)\n\nRudolph Sohm\n* ![Max Weber](image)\n\nMax Weber\n* ![August Weismann](image)\n\nAugust Weismann\n* ![Adolf Otto Reinhold Windaus](image)\n\nAdolf Otto Reinhold Windaus\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* University Medical Center Freiburg\n* Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies\n* University Church, Freiburg\n* Freiburg School of Economic Thought\n* IMTEK\n* List of Jesuit sites\n* List of medieval universities\n* University of Freiburg Faculty of Biology\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"Universit\u00e4t in Zahlen\". *University of Freiburg* (in German).
