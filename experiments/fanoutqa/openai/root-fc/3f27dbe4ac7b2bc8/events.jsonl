Beatles' influence and enjoyed chart success with covers of their songs.[436] On radio, their arrival marked the beginning of a new era; in 1968 the programme director of New York's WABC radio station forbade his DJs from playing any \"pre-Beatles\" music, marking the defining line of what would be considered oldies on American radio.[437] They helped to redefine the album as something more than just a few hits padded out with \"filler\",[438] and they were primary innovators of the modern music video.[439] The Shea Stadium show with which they opened their 1965 North American tour attracted an estimated 55,600 people,[145] then the largest audience in concert history; Spitz describes the event as a \"major breakthrough ... \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOne national paper's headlines in the following days coined the term \"Beatlemania\" to describe the riotous enthusiasm by screaming fans who greeted the band – and it stuck.[67][68] Although not billed as tour leaders, the Beatles overshadowed American acts Tommy Roe and Chris Montez during the February engagements and assumed top billing \"by audience demand\", something no British act had previously accomplished while touring with artists from the US.[69] A similar situation arose during their May–June tour with Roy Orbison.[70]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 2010s | * 2010: \"Love the Way You Lie\" – Eminem featuring

They are regarded as the most influential band of all time[1] and were integral to the development of 1960s counterculture and the recognition of popular music as an art form.[2] Rooted in skiffle, beat, and 1950s rock 'n' roll, their sound incorporated elements of classical music and traditional pop in innovative ways. The band also explored music styles ranging from folk and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock. As pioneers in recording, songwriting, and artistic presentation, the Beatles revolutionised many aspects of the music industry and were often publicised as leaders of the era's youth and sociocultural movements.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nBrit Award for British Group\n |\n| --- |\n| * The Beatles (1977)\n* The Police (1982)\n* Dire Straits (1983)\n* Culture Club (1984)\n* Wham!

Their initial impact would have been enough to establish the Beatles as one of their era's most influential cultural forces, but they didn't stop there. Although their initial style was a highly original, irresistibly catchy synthesis of early American rock and roll and R&B, the Beatles spent the rest of the 1960s expanding rock's stylistic frontiers, consistently staking out new musical territory on each release. The band's increasingly sophisticated experimentation encompassed a variety of genres, including folk-rock, country, psychedelia, and baroque pop, without sacrificing the effortless mass appeal of their early work.[385]\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. **^** Epstein had been in a fragile emotional state, stressed by personal troubles.

The core trio of Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison, together since 1958, went through a succession of drummers, including Pete Best, before inviting Starr to join them in 1962. Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act, and producer George Martin guided and developed their recordings, greatly expanding their domestic success after they signed with EMI Records and achieved their first hit, \"Love Me Do\", in late 1962. As their popularity grew into the intense fan frenzy dubbed \"Beatlemania\", the band acquired the nickname \"the Fab Four\". Epstein, Martin or another member of the band's entourage was sometimes informally referred to as a \"fifth Beatle\".\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBiographer Jonathan Gould writes that, according to the Nielsen rating service, it was \"the largest audience that had ever been recorded for an American television program\".[97] The next morning, the Beatles awoke to a largely negative critical consensus in the US,[98] but a day later at their first US concert, Beatlemania erupted at the Washington Coliseum.[99] Back in New York the following day, the Beatles met with another strong reception during two shows at Carnegie Hall.[96] The band flew to Florida, where they appeared on *The Ed Sullivan Show* a second time, again before 70 million viewers, before returning to the UK on 22 February.[100]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n93. **^** Davies 1968, p. 218.\n94. **^** Spitz 2005, p. 457.\n95. **^** Spitz 2005, p. 459.\n96. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Lewisohn 1992, p. 137.\n97. **^** Gould 2007, p. 3.\n98. **^** Spitz 2005, pp. 473–474.\n99. **^** Harry 2000a, pp. 1134–1135.\n100. **^** Lewisohn 1992, pp. 137, 146–147.\n101. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Gilmore, Mikal (23 August 1990). \"Bob Dylan, the Beatles, and the Rock of the Sixties\". *Rolling Stone*.

From what began as the Beatlemania fad, the group's popularity grew into what was seen as an embodiment of sociocultural movements of the decade. As icons of the 1960s counterculture, Gould continues, they became a catalyst for bohemianism and activism in various social and political arenas, fuelling movements such as women's liberation, gay liberation and environmentalism.[441] According to Peter Lavezzoli, after the \"more popular than Jesus\" controversy in 1966, the Beatles felt considerable pressure to say the right things and \"began a concerted effort to spread a message of wisdom and higher consciousness\".[169]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n378. **^** \"'The Beatles: Get Back-the Rooftop Performance'\". *www.thebeatles.com*.

However, they were growing tired of the monotony of numerous appearances at the same clubs night after night.[34] In November 1961, during one of the group's frequent performances at the Cavern Club, they encountered Brian Epstein, a local record-store owner and music columnist.[35] He later recalled: \"I immediately liked what I heard. They were fresh, and they were honest, and they had what I thought was a sort of presence ...

Concurrent negotiations with the independent US label Vee-Jay led to the release of some, but not all, of the songs in 1963.[85] Vee-Jay finished preparation for the album *Introducing... The Beatles*, comprising most of the songs of Parlophone's *Please Please Me*, but a management shake-up led to the album not being released.[nb 3] After it emerged that the label did not report royalties on their sales, the licence that Vee-Jay had signed with EMI was voided.[87] A new licence was granted to the Swan label for the single \"She Loves You\". The record received some airplay in the Tidewater area of Virginia from Gene Loving of radio station WGH and was featured on the \"Rate-a-Record\" segment of *American Bandstand*, but it failed to catch on nationally.[88]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOwing to a long-running royalty disagreement, the Beatles were among the last major artists to sign deals with online music services.[357] Residual disagreement emanating from Apple Corps' dispute with Apple, Inc., iTunes' owners, over the use of the name \"Apple\" was also partly responsible for the delay, although in 2008, McCartney stated that the main obstacle to making the Beatles' catalogue available online was that EMI \"want[s] something we're not prepared to give them\".[358] In 2010, the official canon of thirteen Beatles studio albums, *Past Masters*, and the \"Red\" and \"Blue\" greatest-hits albums were made available on iTunes.[359]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring a tour of the Philippines the month after the *Yesterday and Today* furore, the Beatles unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady, Imelda Marcos, who had expected them to attend a breakfast reception at the Presidential Palace.[170] When presented with the invitation, Epstein politely declined on the band members' behalf, as it had never been his policy to accept such official invitations.[171] They soon found that the Marcos regime was unaccustomed to taking no for an answer. The resulting riots endangered the group and they escaped the country with difficulty.[172] Immediately afterwards, the band members visited India for the first time.[173]\n\n\n\n> \n> We're more popular than Jesus now; I don't know which will go first – rock 'n' roll or Christianity.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n– John Lennon, 1966[174]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n302. **^** Unterberger, Richie. \"*Let It Be* – The Beatles\".

A week later, *Sgt.

The acquisition gave him control over the publishing rights to more than 200 Beatles songs, as well as 40,000 other copyrights.[479] In 1995, in a deal that earned him a reported $110 million, Jackson merged his music publishing business with Sony, creating a new company, Sony/ATV Music Publishing, in which he held a 50% stake. The merger made the new company, then valued at over half a billion dollars, the third-largest music publisher in the world.[480] In 2016, Sony acquired Jackson's share of Sony/ATV from the Jackson estate for $750 million.[481]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nLennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr all released solo albums in 1970. Their solo records sometimes involved one or more of the other members;[306] Starr's *Ringo* (1973) was the only album to include compositions and performances by all four ex-Beatles, albeit on separate songs. With Starr's participation, Harrison staged the Concert for Bangladesh in New York City in August 1971.[307] Other than an unreleased jam session in 1974, later bootlegged as *A Toot and a Snore in '74*, Lennon and McCartney never recorded together again.[308]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEpstein brought a demo copy of \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" to Capitol's Brown Meggs, who signed the band and arranged for a $40,000 US marketing campaign. American chart success began after disc jockey Carroll James of AM radio station WWDC, in Washington, DC, obtained a copy of the British single \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" in mid-December 1963 and began playing it on-air.[89] Taped copies of the song soon circulated among other radio stations throughout the US. This caused an increase in demand, leading Capitol to bring forward the release of \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" by three weeks.[90] Issued on 26 December, with the band's previously scheduled debut there just weeks away, \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" sold a million copies, becoming a number-one hit in the US by mid-January.[91] In its wake Vee-Jay released *Introducing... The Beatles*[92] along with Capitol's debut album, *Meet the Beatles!*, while Swan reactivated production of \"She Loves You\".[93]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n359. **^** Aswad, Jem (16 November 2010). \"Beatles End Digital Boycott, Catalog Now on iTunes\". *Rolling Stone*.

such as the Dave Clark Five, the Animals, Petula Clark, the Kinks, and the Rolling Stones to achieve success in America.[105] During the week of 4 April 1964, the Beatles held twelve positions on the

Beatles' influence and enjoyed chart success with covers of their songs.[436] On radio, their arrival marked the beginning of a new era; in 1968 the programme director of New York's WABC radio station forbade his DJs from playing any \"pre-Beatles\" music, marking the defining line of what would be considered oldies on American radio.[437] They helped to redefine the album as something more than just a few hits padded out with \"filler\",[438] and they were primary innovators of the modern music video.[439] The Shea Stadium show with which they opened their 1965 North American tour attracted an estimated 55,600 people,[145] then the largest audience in concert history; Spitz describes the event as a \"major breakthrough ... \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOne national paper's headlines in the following days coined the term \"Beatlemania\" to describe the riotous enthusiasm by screaming fans who greeted the band – and it stuck.[67][68] Although not billed as tour leaders, the Beatles overshadowed American acts Tommy Roe and Chris Montez during the February engagements and assumed top billing \"by audience demand\", something no British act had previously accomplished while touring with artists from the US.[69] A similar situation arose during their May–June tour with Roy Orbison.[70]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 2010s | * 2010: \"Love the Way You Lie\" – Eminem featuring

They are regarded as the most influential band of all time[1] and were integral to the development of 1960s counterculture and the recognition of popular music as an art form.[2] Rooted in skiffle, beat, and 1950s rock 'n' roll, their sound incorporated elements of classical music and traditional pop in innovative ways. The band also explored music styles ranging from folk and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock. As pioneers in recording, songwriting, and artistic presentation, the Beatles revolutionised many aspects of the music industry and were often publicised as leaders of the era's youth and sociocultural movements.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nBrit Award for British Group\n |\n| --- |\n| * The Beatles (1977)\n* The Police (1982)\n* Dire Straits (1983)\n* Culture Club (1984)\n* Wham!

Their initial impact would have been enough to establish the Beatles as one of their era's most influential cultural forces, but they didn't stop there. Although their initial style was a highly original, irresistibly catchy synthesis of early American rock and roll and R&B, the Beatles spent the rest of the 1960s expanding rock's stylistic frontiers, consistently staking out new musical territory on each release. The band's increasingly sophisticated experimentation encompassed a variety of genres, including folk-rock, country, psychedelia, and baroque pop, without sacrificing the effortless mass appeal of their early work.[385]\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. **^** Epstein had been in a fragile emotional state, stressed by personal troubles.

The core trio of Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison, together since 1958, went through a succession of drummers, including Pete Best, before inviting Starr to join them in 1962. Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act, and producer George Martin guided and developed their recordings, greatly expanding their domestic success after they signed with EMI Records and achieved their first hit, \"Love Me Do\", in late 1962. As their popularity grew into the intense fan frenzy dubbed \"Beatlemania\", the band acquired the nickname \"the Fab Four\". Epstein, Martin or another member of the band's entourage was sometimes informally referred to as a \"fifth Beatle\".\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBiographer Jonathan Gould writes that, according to the Nielsen rating service, it was \"the largest audience that had ever been recorded for an American television program\".[97] The next morning, the Beatles awoke to a largely negative critical consensus in the US,[98] but a day later at their first US concert, Beatlemania erupted at the Washington Coliseum.[99] Back in New York the following day, the Beatles met with another strong reception during two shows at Carnegie Hall.[96] The band flew to Florida, where they appeared on *The Ed Sullivan Show* a second time, again before 70 million viewers, before returning to the UK on 22 February.[100]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n93. **^** Davies 1968, p. 218.\n94. **^** Spitz 2005, p. 457.\n95. **^** Spitz 2005, p. 459.\n96. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Lewisohn 1992, p. 137.\n97. **^** Gould 2007, p. 3.\n98. **^** Spitz 2005, pp. 473–474.\n99. **^** Harry 2000a, pp. 1134–1135.\n100. **^** Lewisohn 1992, pp. 137, 146–147.\n101. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Gilmore, Mikal (23 August 1990). \"Bob Dylan, the Beatles, and the Rock of the Sixties\". *Rolling Stone*.

From what began as the Beatlemania fad, the group's popularity grew into what was seen as an embodiment of sociocultural movements of the decade. As icons of the 1960s counterculture, Gould continues, they became a catalyst for bohemianism and activism in various social and political arenas, fuelling movements such as women's liberation, gay liberation and environmentalism.[441] According to Peter Lavezzoli, after the \"more popular than Jesus\" controversy in 1966, the Beatles felt considerable pressure to say the right things and \"began a concerted effort to spread a message of wisdom and higher consciousness\".[169]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n378. **^** \"'The Beatles: Get Back-the Rooftop Performance'\". *www.thebeatles.com*.

However, they were growing tired of the monotony of numerous appearances at the same clubs night after night.[34] In November 1961, during one of the group's frequent performances at the Cavern Club, they encountered Brian Epstein, a local record-store owner and music columnist.[35] He later recalled: \"I immediately liked what I heard.

Concurrent negotiations with the independent US label Vee-Jay led to the release of some, but not all, of the songs in 1963.[85] Vee-Jay finished preparation for the album *Introducing... The Beatles*, comprising most of the songs of Parlophone's *Please Please Me*, but a management shake-up led to the album not being released.[nb 3] After it emerged that the label did not report royalties on their sales, the licence that Vee-Jay had signed with EMI was voided.[87] A new licence was granted to the Swan label for the single \"She Loves You\". The record received some airplay in the Tidewater area of Virginia from Gene Loving of radio station WGH and was featured on the \"Rate-a-Record\" segment of *American Bandstand*, but it failed to catch on nationally.[88]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOwing to a long-running royalty disagreement, the Beatles were among the last major artists to sign deals with online music services.[357] Residual disagreement emanating from Apple Corps' dispute with Apple, Inc., iTunes' owners, over the use of the name \"Apple\" was also partly responsible for the delay, although in 2008, McCartney stated that the main obstacle to making the Beatles' catalogue available online was that EMI \"want[s] something we're not prepared to give them\".[358] In 2010, the official canon of thirteen Beatles studio albums, *Past Masters*, and the \"Red\" and \"Blue\" greatest-hits albums were made available on iTunes.[359]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring a tour of the Philippines the month after the *Yesterday and Today* furore, the Beatles unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady, Imelda Marcos, who had expected them to attend a breakfast reception at the Presidential Palace.[170] When presented with the invitation, Epstein politely declined on the band members' behalf, as it had never been his policy to accept such official invitations.[171] They soon found that the Marcos regime was unaccustomed to taking no for an answer. The resulting riots endangered the group and they escaped the country with difficulty.[172] Immediately afterwards, the band members visited India for the first time.[173]\n\n\n\n> \n> We're more popular than Jesus now; I don't know which will go first – rock 'n' roll or Christianity.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n– John Lennon, 1966[174]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n302. **^** Unterberger, Richie. \"*Let It Be* – The Beatles\".

The acquisition gave him control over the publishing rights to more than 200 Beatles songs, as well as 40,000 other copyrights.[479] In 1995, in a deal that earned him a reported $110 million, Jackson merged his music publishing business with Sony, creating a new company, Sony/ATV Music Publishing, in which he held a 50% stake. The merger made the new company, then valued at over half a billion dollars, the third-largest music publisher in the world.[480] In 2016, Sony acquired Jackson's share of Sony/ATV from the Jackson estate for $750 million.[481]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nLennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr all released solo albums in 1970. Their solo records sometimes involved one or more of the other members;[306] Starr's *Ringo* (1973) was the only album to include compositions and performances by all four ex-Beatles, albeit on separate songs. With Starr's participation, Harrison staged the Concert for Bangladesh in New York City in August 1971.[307] Other than an unreleased jam session in 1974, later bootlegged as *A Toot and a Snore in '74*, Lennon and McCartney never recorded together again.[308]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEpstein brought a demo copy of \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" to Capitol's Brown Meggs, who signed the band and arranged for a $40,000 US marketing campaign. American chart success began after disc jockey Carroll James of AM radio station WWDC, in Washington, DC, obtained a copy of the British single \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" in mid-December 1963 and began playing it on-air.[89] Taped copies of the song soon circulated among other radio stations throughout the US. This caused an increase in demand, leading Capitol to bring forward the release of \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" by three weeks.[90] Issued on 26 December, with the band's previously scheduled debut there just weeks away, \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" sold a million copies, becoming a number-one hit in the US by mid-January.[91] In its wake Vee-Jay released *Introducing...

statistician Joel Whitburn,[401][402] 139 according to Presley historian Adam Victor.[400][401] Presley's rankings for top ten and number-one hits vary depending on how the double-sided \"Hound Dog/Don't Be Cruel\" and \"Don't/I Beg of You\" singles, which precede the inception of *Billboard*'s unified Hot 100 chart, are analyzed.[e] According to Whitburn's analysis, Presley holds the record with 38, tying with Madonna;[399] per *Billboard*'s current assessment, he ranks second with 36.[403] Whitburn and *Billboard* concur that the Beatles hold the record for most number-one hits with 20, and that Mariah Carey is second with 19.[404] Whitburn has Presley with 18:[399] *Billboard* has him third with 17.[405] According to *Billboard*,  Presley has 79 cumulative weeks at number one: alone

He tallies each side of the former single as a number-one (*Billboard*'s sales chart had \"Don't Be Cruel\" at number one for five weeks, then \"Hound Dog\" for six) and reckons \"I Beg of You\" as a top ten, as it reached number eight on the old Top 100 chart. *Billboard* now considers both singles as unified items, ignoring the historical sales split of the former and its old Top 100 chart entirely. Whitburn thus analyzes the four songs as yielding three number ones and a total of four top tens. *Billboard* now states that they yielded just two number ones and a total of two top tens, voiding the separate chart appearances of \"Hound Dog\" and \"I Beg of You\".\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPresley's rise to national attention in 1956 transformed the field of popular music and had a huge effect on the broader scope of popular culture.[364] As the catalyst for the cultural revolution that was rock and roll, he was central not only to defining it as a musical genre but in making it a touchstone of youth culture and rebellious attitude.[365] With its racially mixed origins—repeatedly affirmed by Presley—rock and roll's occupation of a central position in mainstream American culture facilitated a new acceptance and appreciation of black culture.[366]\n\n\nIn this regard, Little Richard said of Presley, \"He was an integrator. Elvis was a blessing. They wouldn't let black music through. He opened the door for black music.\"[367] Al Green agreed: \"He broke the ice for all of us.\"[368]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nBest-selling singles by year in the United Kingdom\n |\n| --- |\n| 1950s | * 1952: \"Here in My Heart\" – Al Martino\n* 1953: \"I Believe\" – Frankie Laine\n* 1954: \"Secret Love\" – Doris Day\n* 1955: \"Rose Marie\" – Slim Whitman\n* 1956: \"I'll Be Home\" – Pat Boone\n* 1957: \"Diana\" – Paul Anka\n* 1958: \"Jailhouse Rock\" – Elvis Presley\n* 1959: \"Living Doll\" – Cliff Richard (UK)\n |\n| 1960s | * 1960: \"It's Now or Never\" – Elvis Presley\n* 1961: \"Wooden Heart\" – Elvis Presley\n* 1962: \"I Remember You\" – Frank Ifield (UK)\n* 1963: \"She Loves You\" – The Beatles (UK)\n* 1964: \"Can't Buy Me Love\" – The Beatles (UK)\n* 1965: \"Tears\" – Ken Dodd (UK)\n* 1966: \"Green, Green Grass of Home\" – Tom Jones (UK)\n* 1967: \"Release Me\" – Engelbert Humperdinck (UK)\n* 1968: \"Hey Jude\" – The Beatles (UK)\n* 1969: \"Sugar, Sugar\" – The Archies\n |\n| 1970s | * 1970: \"The Wonder of You\" – Elvis Presley / \"In the Summertime\" – Mungo Jerry (UK)\n* 1971: \"My Sweet Lord\" – George Harrison (UK)\n* 1972: \"Amazing Grace\" – Royal Scots Dragoon Guards (UK)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* \"Elvis Presley\".

The cultural range of his music has expanded to the point where it includes not only the hits of the day, but also patriotic recitals, pure country gospel, and really dirty blues. ... Elvis has emerged as a great *artist*, a great *rocker*, a great *purveyor of schlock*, a great *heart throb*, a great *bore*, a great *symbol of potency*, a great *ham*, a great *nice person*, and, yes, a great American.[397]\n> \n> \n\n\n## Achievements[edit]\n\n\nHaving sold about 500 million records worldwide, Presley is one of the best-selling music artists of all time.[398]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe persistence of such attitudes was fueled by resentment over the fact that Presley, whose musical and visual performance idiom owed much to African-American sources, achieved the cultural acknowledgement and commercial success largely denied his black peers.[347] Into the 21st century, the notion that Presley had \"stolen\" black music still found adherents.[*example needed*][349][350] Notable among African-American entertainers expressly rejecting this view was Jackie Wilson, who argued, \"A lot of people have accused Elvis of stealing the black man's music, when in fact, almost every black solo entertainer copied his stage mannerisms from Elvis.\"[351] Moreover, Presley acknowledged his debt to African-American musicians throughout his career. Addressing his '68 Comeback Special audience, he said, \"Rock 'n' roll music is basically gospel or rhythm and blues, or it sprang from that. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHowever, years of prescription drug abuse and unhealthy eating habits severely compromised his health, and Presley died suddenly in 1977 at his Graceland estate at the age of 42.\n\n\nHaving sold roughly 500 million records worldwide, Presley is one of the best-selling music artists of all time. He was commercially successful in many genres, including pop, country, rhythm & blues, adult contemporary, and gospel. He won three Grammy Awards, received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36, and has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame. He also holds several records, including the most RIAA-certified gold and platinum albums, the most albums charted on the *Billboard* 200, the most number-one albums by a solo artist on the UK Albums Chart, and the most number-one singles by any act on the UK Singles Chart.

His music career began there in 1954, at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience. Presley, on guitar and accompanied by lead guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage him for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single, \"Heartbreak Hotel\", was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. Within a year, RCA would sell ten million Presley singles. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Whitburn, Joel (2006). *The Billboard Book of Top 40 Country Hits* (2nd ed.). Billboard Books.

The same year, Presley became the first rock and roll singer to be awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award (then known as the Bing Crosby Award).[220][221] Three new, non-film Presley studio albums were released in 1971. Best received by critics was *Elvis Country*, a concept record that focused on genre standards.[222] The biggest seller was *Elvis Sings The Wonderful World of Christmas*. According to Greil Marcus, \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n### Influences[edit]\n\n\nPresley's earliest musical influence came from gospel. His mother recalled that from the age of two, at the Assembly of God church in Tupelo attended by the family, \"he would slide down off my lap, run into the aisle and scramble up to the platform. There he would stand looking at the choir and trying to sing with them.\"[306] In Memphis, Presley frequently attended all-night gospel singings at the Ellis Auditorium, where groups such as the Statesmen Quartet led the music in a style that, Guralnick suggests, sowed the seeds of Presley's future stage act:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs of 2023[update], the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) credits Presley with 146.5 million certified album sales in the US, third all time behind the Beatles and Garth Brooks.[413] He holds the records for most gold albums (101, nearly double second-place Barbra Streisand's 51),[414] and most platinum albums (57).[415] His 25 multi-platinum albums is second behind the Beatles' 26.[416] His total of 197 album certification awards (including one diamond award), far outpaces the Beatles' second-best 122.[417] He has the 9th-most gold singles (54, tied with Justin Bieber),[418] and the 16th-most platinum singles (27).[419]\n\n\nIn 2012, the spider *Paradonea presleyi* was named in his honor.[420] In 2018, President Donald Trump awarded Presley the Presidential Medal of Freedom posthumously.[421]\n\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Elvis Presley albums discography, Elvis Presley singles discography, and List of songs recorded by Elvis Presley\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n407. **^** RRHF 2010.\n408. **^** Trust 2023.\n409. **^** Myers 2022.\n410. **^** Myers 2021.\n411. **^** Trust 2015.\n412. **^** Sexton 2016.\n413. **^** RIAA 2020a.\n414. **^** RIAA 2020b.\n415. **^** RIAA 2020c.\n416. **^** RIAA 2020d.\n417. **^** Lewis 2017.\n418. **^** RIAA 2020e.\n419. **^** RIAA 2020f.\n420. **^** Miller et al. 2012.\n421. **^** BBC News 2018.\n\n### General sources[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy August, Sun had released ten sides credited to \"Elvis Presley, Scotty and Bill\"; the latest recordings included a drummer. Some of the songs, like \"That's All Right\", were in what one Memphis journalist described as the \"R&B idiom of negro field jazz\"; others, like \"Blue Moon of Kentucky\", were \"more in the country field\", \"but there was a curious blending of the two different musics in both\".[65] This blend of styles made it difficult for Presley's music to find radio airplay. According to Neal, many country-music disc jockeys would not play it because Presley sounded too much like a black artist and none of the R&B stations would touch him because \"he sounded too much like a hillbilly.\"[66] The blend came to be known as \"rockabilly\". At the time, Presley was billed as \"The King of Western Bop\", \"The Hillbilly Cat\", and \"The Memphis Flash\".[67]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBetween 1977 and 1981, six of Presley's posthumously released singles were top-ten country hits.[277] Graceland was opened to the public in 1982. Attracting over half a million visitors annually, it became the second-most-visited home in the United States, after the White House.[285] The residence was declared a National Historic Landmark in 2006.[286]\n\n\nPresley has been inducted into five music halls of fame: the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1986), the Country Music Hall of Fame (1998), the Gospel Music Hall of Fame (2001), the Rockabilly Hall of Fame (2007), and the Memphis Music Hall of Fame (2012). In 1984, he received the W. C. Handy Award from the Blues Foundation and the Academy of Country Music's first Golden Hat Award.

In 1957, his first gospel record was released, the four-song EP *Peace in the Valley*.

It included a reimagined duet with Lisa Marie, on the album's title track.[303]\n\n\nIn 2022, Baz Luhrmann's film *Elvis*, a biographical film about Presley's life, was released.

As of August 2022, the film had grossed $261.8 million worldwide on a $85 million budget, becoming the second-highest-grossing music biopic of all-time behind *Bohemian Rhapsody* (2018), and the fifth-highest-grossing Australian-produced film. For his portrayal of Elvis, Butler won the Golden Globe and was nominated for the Oscar for Best Actor.[304] In January 2023, his 1962 Lockheed 1329 JetStar sold at an auction for $260,000.[305]\n\n\n\n## Artistry[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Miller, James (2000). *Flowers in the Dustbin: The Rise of Rock and Roll, 1947–1977*.

However, the commercial returns steadily diminished. From 1964 through 1968, Presley had only one top-ten hit: \"Crying in the Chapel\" (1965), a gospel number recorded in 1960. As for non-film albums, between the June 1962 release of *Pot Luck* and the November 1968 release of the soundtrack to the television special that signaled his comeback, only one LP of new material by Presley was issued: the gospel album *How Great Thou Art* (1967). It won him his first Grammy Award, for Best Sacred Performance. As Marsh described, Presley was \"arguably the greatest white gospel singer of his time [and] really the last rock & roll artist to make gospel as vital a component of his musical personality as his secular songs\".[181]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Elvis Aaron Presley**[a] (January 8, 1935 – August 16, 1977), also known simply as **Elvis**, was an American singer and actor. Known as the \"King of Rock and Roll\", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century. Presley's energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, brought both great success and initial controversy.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe knew all of Hank Snow's songs,[28] and he loved records by other country singers such as Roy Acuff, Ernest Tubb, Ted Daffan, Jimmie Rodgers, Jimmie Davis, and Bob Wills.[29] The Southern gospel singer Jake Hess, one of his favorite performers, was a significant influence on his ballad-singing style.[30][31] Presley was a regular audience member at the monthly All-Night Singings downtown, where many of the white gospel groups that performed reflected the influence of African American spirituals.[32] Presley listened to regional radio stations, such as WDIA, that played what were then called \"race records\": spirituals, blues, and the modern, backbeat-heavy rhythm and blues.[33] Like some of his peers, he may have attended blues venues only on nights designated for exclusively white audiences.[34] Many of his future recordings were inspired by local African-American musicians such as Arthur Crudup and Rufus Thomas.[35][36] B.B. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n> were the most revealing of all. Unlike many white artists ... who watered down the gritty edges of the original R&B versions of songs in the '50s, Presley reshaped them. He not only injected the tunes with his own vocal character but also made guitar, not piano, the lead instrument in all three cases.[83]\n> \n> \n\n It became the first rock and roll album to top the *Billboard* chart, a position it held for ten weeks.[79] While Presley was not an innovative guitarist like Moore or contemporary African American rockers Bo Diddley and Chuck Berry, cultural historian Gilbert B. Rodman argued that the album's cover image, \"of Elvis having the time of his life on stage *with a guitar in his hands* played a crucial role in positioning the guitar ... as the instrument that best captured the style and spirit of this new music.\"[84]\n\n\n#### *Milton Berle Show* and \"Hound Dog\"[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThough the camerawork was relatively discreet during his debut, with leg-concealing closeups when he danced, the studio audience reacted with screams.[110][111] Presley's performance of his forthcoming single, the ballad \"Love Me Tender\", prompted a record-shattering million advance orders.[112] More than any other single event, it was this first appearance on *The Ed Sullivan Show* that made Presley a national celebrity.[97]\n\n\n\nAccompanying Presley's rise to fame, a cultural shift was taking place that he both helped inspire and came to symbolize. The historian Marty Jezer wrote that Presley began the \"biggest pop craze\" since Glenn Miller and Frank Sinatra  and brought rock and roll to mainstream culture: \n\n\n> As Presley set the artistic pace, other artists followed. ... Presley, more than anyone else, gave the young a belief in themselves as a distinct and somehow unified generation—the first in America ever to feel the power of an integrated youth culture.[113]\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n97. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** Marcus 2006.\n98. **^** Marsh 1982, p. 100.\n99. **^** Austen 2005, p. 13.\n100. **^** Allen 1992, p. 270.\n101. **^** Rock 'N Roll Stars 1956, p. 5.\n102. **^** Keogh 2004, p. 73.\n103. **^** Jorgensen 1998, p. 51.\n104. **^** Guralnick & Jorgensen 1999, pp. 80–81.\n105. **^** Whitburn 1993, p. 5.\n106. **^** Jorgensen 1998, pp. 60–65.\n107. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Austen 2005, p. 16.\n108. **^** Edgerton 2007, p. 187.\n109. **^** Brown & Broeske 1997, p. 93.\n110. **^** Guralnick 1994, p. 338.\n111. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Gibson 2005.\n112. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Victor 2008, p. 439.\n113. **^** Jezer 1982, p. 281.\n114. **^** Moore & Dickerson 1997, p. 175.\n115. **^** Guralnick 1994, p. 343.\n116. **^** Guralnick 1994, p. 335.\n117. **^** Marsh 1980, p. 395.\n118. **^** O'Malley 2016.\n119. **^** Jorgensen 1998, p. 71.\n120. **^** Palladino 1996, p. 131.\n121. **^** Stanley & Coffey 1998, p. 37.\n122. **^** Clayton & Heard 2003, pp. 117–118.\n123. **^** Keogh 2004, p. 90.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhile Presley performed several of his classic ballads for the *'68 Comeback Special*, the sound of the show was dominated by aggressive rock and roll. He recorded few new straight rock and roll songs thereafter; as he explained, they had become \"hard to find\".[331] A significant exception was \"Burning Love\", his last major hit on the pop charts. Like his work of the 1950s, Presley's subsequent recordings reworked pop and country songs, but in markedly different permutations. His stylistic range now began to embrace a more contemporary rock sound as well as soul and funk. Much of *Elvis in Memphis*, as well as \"Suspicious Minds\", cut at the same sessions, reflected this new rock and soul fusion. In the mid-1970s, many of his singles found a home on country radio, the field where he first became a star.[332]\n\n\n\n### Vocal style and range[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn December 4, Presley dropped into Sun Records, where Carl Perkins and Jerry Lee Lewis were recording, and had an impromptu jam session along with Johnny Cash. Though Phillips no longer had the right to release any Presley material, he made sure that the session was captured on tape. The results, none officially released for twenty-five years, became known as the \"Million Dollar Quartet\" recordings.[119] The year ended with a front-page story in *The Wall Street Journal* reporting that Presley merchandise had brought in $22 million on top of his record sales,[120] and *Billboard*'s declaration that he had placed more songs in the top 100 than any other artist since records were first charted.[121] In his first full year at RCA Victor, then the record industry's largest company, Presley had accounted for over fifty percent of the label's singles sales.[112]\n\n\n\n#### Leiber and Stoller collaboration and draft notice[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Burke, Ken; Griffin, Dan (2006). *The Blue Moon Boys: The Story of Elvis Presley's Band*.

On the set of *Jailhouse Rock*, Presley granted Robinson an interview, though he was no longer dealing with the mainstream press. He denied making such a statement: \n\n\n> I never said anything like that, and people who know me know that I wouldn't have said it. ... A lot of people seem to think I started this business.

His first LP of sacred material, *His Hand in Mine*, followed two months later; it reached number 13 on the U.S. pop chart and number 3 in the United Kingdom, remarkable figures for a gospel album. In February 1961, Presley performed two shows in Memphis, for a benefit for twenty-four local charities. During a luncheon preceding the event, RCA presented him with a plaque certifying worldwide sales of over 75 million records.[169] A twelve-hour Nashville session in mid-March yielded nearly all of Presley's next studio album, *Something for Everybody*.[170] According to John Robertson, it exemplifies the Nashville sound, the restrained, cosmopolitan style that would define country music in the 1960s. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPresley undertook three brief tours during the year, continuing to generate a crazed audience response.[130] A Detroit newspaper suggested that \"the trouble with going to see Elvis Presley is that you're liable to get killed\".[131] Villanova students pelted the singer with eggs in Philadelphia,[131] and in Vancouver the crowd rioted after the show ended, destroying the stage.[132] Frank Sinatra, who had inspired the swooning and screaming of teenage girls in the 1940s, decried rock and roll as \"brutal, ugly, degenerate, vicious. ... It fosters almost totally negative and destructive reactions in young people. It smells phoney and false. It is sung, played and written, for the most part, by cretinous goons. ... This rancid-smelling aphrodisiac I deplore.\"[133] Asked for a response, Presley said, \"I admire the man. He has a right to say what he wants to say.

Songwriters were obliged to forgo one-third of their customary royalties in exchange for having Presley perform their compositions.[75][c] By December, RCA had begun to heavily promote its new singer, and before month's end had reissued many of his Sun recordings.[78]\n\n\n\n### 1956–1958: commercial breakout and controversy[edit]\n\n\n#### First national TV appearances and debut album[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\"No,\" Presley said, \"that's the real king of rock and roll.\"[201] The next day, Parker's negotiations with the hotel resulted in a five-year contract for Presley to play each February and August, at an annual salary of $1 million.[202] *Newsweek* commented, \"There are several unbelievable things about Elvis, but the most incredible is his staying power in a world where meteoric careers fade like shooting stars.\"[203] *Rolling Stone* called Presley \"supernatural, his own resurrection.\"[204] In November, Presley's final non-concert film, *Change of Habit*, opened. The double album *From Memphis to Vegas/From Vegas to Memphis* came out the same month; the first LP consisted of live performances from the International, the second of more cuts from the American Sound sessions. \"Suspicious Minds\" reached the top of the charts—Presley's first U.S. pop number-one in over seven years, and his last.[205]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n> \n> I know he invented rock and roll, in a manner of speaking, but ... that's not why he's worshiped as a god today.

It topped the charts in over twenty countries and was included in a compilation of Presley's number-one hits, *ELV1S*, which was also an international success. The album returned Presley to the top of the *Billboard* chart for the first time in almost three decades.[288]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBuoyed by the experience of the *Comeback Special*, Presley engaged in a prolific series of recording sessions at American Sound Studio, which led to the acclaimed *From Elvis in Memphis*. Released in June 1969, it was his first secular, non-soundtrack album from a dedicated period in the studio in eight years. As described by Marsh, it is \"a masterpiece in which Presley immediately catches up with pop music trends that had seemed to pass him by during the movie years. He sings country songs, soul songs and rockers with real conviction, a stunning achievement.\"[194] The album featured the hit single \"In the Ghetto\", issued in April, which reached number three on the pop chart—Presley's first non-gospel top ten hit since \"Bossa Nova Baby\" in 1963. Further hit singles were culled from the American Sound sessions: \"Suspicious Minds\", \"Don't Cry Daddy\", and \"Kentucky Rain\".[195]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Jorgensen, Ernst (1998). *Elvis Presley – A Life in Music: The Complete Recording Sessions*.

Already an international star, he was attracting fans even where his music was not officially released: *The New York Times* reported that pressings of his music on discarded X-ray plates were commanding high prices in Leningrad.[125] Presley purchased his 18-room mansion, Graceland, on March 19, 1957.[126] Before the purchase, Elvis recorded *Loving You*—the soundtrack to his second film, which was released in July. It was his third straight number-one album. The title track was written by Leiber and Stoller, who were then retained to write four of the six songs recorded at the sessions for *Jailhouse Rock*, Presley's next film. The songwriting team effectively produced the *Jailhouse* sessions and developed a close working relationship with Presley, who came to regard them as his \"good-luck charm\".[127] \"He was fast,\" said Leiber. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAn R&B hit for Roy Hamilton in 1955 and a pop hit for blue-eyed soul singer Timi Yuro in 1961, Presley's deep soul version was picked up by country radio in 1976.[258]\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file?

with 38, tying with Madonna;[399] per *Billboard*'s current assessment, he ranks second with 36.[403] Whitburn and *Billboard* concur that the Beatles hold the record for most number-one hits with 20,

He tallies each side of the former single as a number-one (*Billboard*'s sales chart had \"Don't Be Cruel\" at number one for five weeks, then \"Hound Dog\" for six) and reckons \"I Beg of You\" as a top ten, as it reached number eight on the old Top 100 chart. *Billboard* now considers both singles as unified items, ignoring the historical sales split of the former and its old Top 100 chart entirely.

Elvis was a blessing. They wouldn't let black music through. He opened the door for black music.\"[367] Al Green agreed: \"He broke the ice for all of us.\"[368]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nBest-selling singles by year in the United Kingdom\n |\n| --- |\n| 1950s | * 1952: \"Here in My Heart\" – Al Martino\n* 1953: \"I Believe\" – Frankie Laine\n* 1954: \"Secret Love\" – Doris Day\n* 1955: \"Rose Marie\" – Slim Whitman\n* 1956: \"I'll Be Home\" – Pat Boone\n* 1957: \"Diana\" – Paul Anka\n* 1958: \"Jailhouse Rock\" – Elvis Presley\n* 1959: \"Living Doll\" – Cliff Richard (UK)\n |\n| 1960s | * 1960: \"It's Now or Never\" – Elvis Presley\n* 1961: \"Wooden Heart\" – Elvis Presley\n* 1962: \"I Remember You\" – Frank Ifield (UK)\n* 1963: \"She Loves You\" – The Beatles (UK)\n* 1964: \"Can't Buy Me Love\" – The Beatles (UK)\n* 1965: \"Tears\" – Ken Dodd (UK)\n* 1966: \"Green, Green Grass of Home\" – Tom Jones (UK)\n* 1967: \"Release Me\" – Engelbert Humperdinck (UK)\n* 1968: \"Hey Jude\" – The Beatles (UK)\n* 1969: \"Sugar, Sugar\" – The Archies\n |\n| 1970s | * 1970: \"The Wonder of You\" – Elvis Presley / \"In the Summertime\" – Mungo Jerry (UK)\n* 1971: \"My Sweet Lord\" – George Harrison (UK)\n* 1972: \"Amazing Grace\" – Royal Scots Dragoon Guards (UK)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* \"Elvis Presley\".

The cultural range of his music has expanded to the point where it includes not only the hits of the day, but also patriotic recitals, pure country gospel, and really dirty blues. ... Elvis has emerged as a great *artist*, a great *rocker*, a great *purveyor of schlock*, a great *heart throb*, a great *bore*, a great *symbol of potency*, a great *ham*, a great *nice person*, and, yes, a great American.[397]\n> \n> \n\n\n## Achievements[edit]\n\n\nHaving sold about 500 million records worldwide, Presley is one of the best-selling music artists of all time.[398]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe persistence of such attitudes was fueled by resentment over the fact that Presley, whose musical and visual performance idiom owed much to African-American sources, achieved the cultural acknowledgement and commercial success largely denied his black peers.[347] Into the 21st century, the notion that Presley had \"stolen\" black music still found adherents.[*example needed*][349][350] Notable among African-American entertainers expressly rejecting this view was Jackie Wilson, who argued, \"A lot of people have accused Elvis of stealing the black man's music, when in fact, almost every black solo entertainer copied his stage mannerisms from Elvis.\"[351] Moreover, Presley acknowledged his debt to African-American musicians throughout his career. Addressing his '68 Comeback Special audience, he said, \"Rock 'n' roll music is basically gospel or rhythm and blues, or it sprang from that. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHowever, years of prescription drug abuse and unhealthy eating habits severely compromised his health, and Presley died suddenly in 1977 at his Graceland estate at the age of 42.\n\n\nHaving sold roughly 500 million records worldwide, Presley is one of the best-selling music artists of all time. He was commercially successful in many genres, including pop, country, rhythm & blues, adult contemporary, and gospel. He won three Grammy Awards, received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36, and has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame. He also holds several records, including the most RIAA-certified gold and platinum albums, the most albums charted on the *Billboard* 200, the most number-one albums by a solo artist on the UK Albums Chart, and the most number-one singles by any act on the UK Singles Chart. In 2018, Presley was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\n\n\n\n## Life and career[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Early life of Elvis Presley\n\n### 1935–1953: early years[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWith a series of successful television appearances and chart-topping records, Presley became the leading figure of the newly popular rock and roll; though his performative style and promotion of the then-marginalized sound of African Americans[6] led to him being widely considered a threat to the moral well-being of white American youth.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Friedlander, Paul (1996). *Rock and Roll: A Social History*.

His music career began there in 1954, at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience. Presley, on guitar and accompanied by lead guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage him for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single, \"Heartbreak Hotel\", was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. Within a year, RCA would sell ten million Presley singles. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Whitburn, Joel (2006). *The Billboard Book of Top 40 Country Hits* (2nd ed.). Billboard Books.

The same year, Presley became the first rock and roll singer to be awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award (then known as the Bing Crosby Award).[220][221] Three new, non-film Presley studio albums were released in 1971.

According to Greil Marcus, \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n### Influences[edit]\n\n\nPresley's earliest musical influence came from gospel. His mother recalled that from the age of two, at the Assembly of God church in Tupelo attended by the family, \"he would slide down off my lap, run into the aisle and scramble up to the platform. There he would stand looking at the choir and trying to sing with them.\"[306] In Memphis, Presley frequently attended all-night gospel singings at the Ellis Auditorium, where groups such as the Statesmen Quartet led the music in a style that, Guralnick suggests, sowed the seeds of Presley's future stage act:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs of 2023[update], the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) credits Presley with 146.5 million certified album sales in the US, third all time behind the Beatles and Garth Brooks.[413] He holds the records for most gold albums (101, nearly double second-place Barbra Streisand's 51),[414] and most platinum albums (57).[415] His 25 multi-platinum albums is second behind the Beatles' 26.[416] His total of 197 album certification awards (including one diamond award), far outpaces the Beatles' second-best 122.[417] He has the 9th-most gold singles (54, tied with Justin Bieber),[418] and the 16th-most platinum singles (27).[419]\n\n\nIn 2012, the spider *Paradonea presleyi* was named in his honor.[420] In 2018, President Donald Trump awarded Presley the Presidential Medal of Freedom posthumously.[421]\n\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Elvis Presley albums discography, Elvis Presley singles discography, and List of songs recorded by Elvis Presley\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n407. **^** RRHF 2010.\n408. **^** Trust 2023.\n409. **^** Myers 2022.\n410. **^** Myers 2021.\n411. **^** Trust 2015.\n412. **^** Sexton 2016.\n413. **^** RIAA 2020a.\n414. **^** RIAA 2020b.\n415. **^** RIAA 2020c.\n416. **^** RIAA 2020d.\n417. **^** Lewis 2017.\n418. **^** RIAA 2020e.\n419. **^** RIAA 2020f.\n420. **^** Miller et al. 2012.\n421. **^** BBC News 2018.\n\n### General sources[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy August, Sun had released ten sides credited to \"Elvis Presley, Scotty and Bill\"; the latest recordings included a drummer. Some of the songs, like \"That's All Right\", were in what one Memphis journalist described as the \"R&B idiom of negro field jazz\"; others, like \"Blue Moon of Kentucky\", were \"more in the country field\", \"but there was a curious blending of the two different musics in both\".[65] This blend of styles made it difficult for Presley's music to find radio airplay. According to Neal, many country-music disc jockeys would not play it because Presley sounded too much like a black artist and none of the R&B stations would touch him because \"he sounded too much like a hillbilly.\"[66] The blend came to be known as \"rockabilly\". At the time, Presley was billed as \"The King of Western Bop\", \"The Hillbilly Cat\", and \"The Memphis Flash\".[67]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBetween 1977 and 1981, six of Presley's posthumously released singles were top-ten country hits.[277] Graceland was opened to the public in 1982.

In 1957, his first gospel record was released, the four-song EP *Peace in the Valley*.

However, the commercial returns steadily diminished. From 1964 through 1968, Presley had only one top-ten hit: \"Crying in the Chapel\" (1965), a gospel number recorded in 1960. As for non-film albums, between the June 1962 release of *Pot Luck* and the November 1968 release of the soundtrack to the television special that signaled his comeback, only one LP of new material by Presley was issued: the gospel album *How Great Thou Art* (1967). It won him his first Grammy Award, for Best Sacred Performance. As Marsh described, Presley was \"arguably the greatest white gospel singer of his time [and] really the last rock & roll artist to make gospel as vital a component of his musical personality as his secular songs\".[181]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Elvis Aaron Presley**[a] (January 8, 1935 – August 16, 1977), also known simply as **Elvis**, was an American singer and actor. Known as the \"King of Rock and Roll\", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century. Presley's energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, brought both great success and initial controversy.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe knew all of Hank Snow's songs,[28] and he loved records by other country singers such as Roy Acuff, Ernest Tubb, Ted Daffan, Jimmie Rodgers, Jimmie Davis, and Bob Wills.[29] The Southern gospel singer Jake Hess, one of his favorite performers, was a significant influence on his ballad-singing style.[30][31] Presley was a regular audience member at the monthly All-Night Singings downtown, where many of the white gospel groups that performed reflected the influence of African American spirituals.[32] Presley listened to regional radio stations, such as WDIA, that played what were then called \"race records\": spirituals, blues, and the modern, backbeat-heavy rhythm and blues.[33] Like some of his peers, he may have attended blues venues only on nights designated for exclusively white audiences.[34] Many of his future recordings were inspired by local African-American musicians such as Arthur Crudup and Rufus Thomas.[35][36] B.B. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n> were the most revealing of all. Unlike many white artists ... who watered down the gritty edges of the original R&B versions of songs in the '50s, Presley reshaped them. He not only injected the tunes with his own vocal character but also made guitar, not piano, the lead instrument in all three cases.[83]\n> \n> \n\n It became the first rock and roll album to top the *Billboard* chart, a position it held for ten weeks.[79] While Presley was not an innovative guitarist like Moore or contemporary African American rockers Bo Diddley and Chuck Berry, cultural historian Gilbert B. Rodman argued that the album's cover image, \"of Elvis having the time of his life on stage *with a guitar in his hands* played a crucial role in positioning the guitar ... as the instrument that best captured the style and spirit of this new music.\"[84]\n\n\n#### *Milton Berle Show* and \"Hound Dog\"[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThough the camerawork was relatively discreet during his debut, with leg-concealing closeups when he danced, the studio audience reacted with screams.[110][111] Presley's performance of his forthcoming single, the ballad \"Love Me Tender\", prompted a record-shattering million advance orders.[112] More than any other single event, it was this first appearance on *The Ed Sullivan Show* that made Presley a national celebrity.[97]\n\n\n\nAccompanying Presley's rise to fame, a cultural shift was taking place that he both helped inspire and came to symbolize. The historian Marty Jezer wrote that Presley began the \"biggest pop craze\" since Glenn Miller and Frank Sinatra  and brought rock and roll to mainstream culture: \n\n\n> As Presley set the artistic pace, other artists followed. ... Presley, more than anyone else, gave the young a belief in themselves as a distinct and somehow unified generation—the first in America ever to feel the power of an integrated youth culture.[113]\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n97. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** Marcus 2006.\n98. **^** Marsh 1982, p. 100.\n99. **^** Austen 2005, p. 13.\n100. **^** Allen 1992, p. 270.\n101. **^** Rock 'N Roll Stars 1956, p. 5.\n102. **^** Keogh 2004, p. 73.\n103. **^** Jorgensen 1998, p. 51.\n104. **^** Guralnick & Jorgensen 1999, pp. 80–81.\n105. **^** Whitburn 1993, p. 5.\n106. **^** Jorgensen 1998, pp. 60–65.\n107. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Austen 2005, p. 16.\n108. **^** Edgerton 2007, p. 187.\n109. **^** Brown & Broeske 1997, p. 93.\n110. **^** Guralnick 1994, p. 338.\n111. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Gibson 2005.\n112. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Victor 2008, p. 439.\n113. **^** Jezer 1982, p. 281.\n114. **^** Moore & Dickerson 1997, p. 175.\n115. **^** Guralnick 1994, p. 343.\n116. **^** Guralnick 1994, p. 335.\n117. **^** Marsh 1980, p. 395.\n118. **^** O'Malley 2016.\n119. **^** Jorgensen 1998, p. 71.\n120. **^** Palladino 1996, p. 131.\n121. **^** Stanley & Coffey 1998, p. 37.\n122. **^** Clayton & Heard 2003, pp. 117–118.\n123. **^** Keogh 2004, p. 90.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhile Presley performed several of his classic ballads for the *'68 Comeback Special*, the sound of the show was dominated by aggressive rock and roll. He recorded few new straight rock and roll songs thereafter; as he explained, they had become \"hard to find\".[331] A significant exception was \"Burning Love\", his last major hit on the pop charts. Like his work of the 1950s, Presley's subsequent recordings reworked pop and country songs, but in markedly different permutations. His stylistic range now began to embrace a more contemporary rock sound as well as soul and funk. Much of *Elvis in Memphis*, as well as \"Suspicious Minds\", cut at the same sessions, reflected this new rock and soul fusion. In the mid-1970s, many of his singles found a home on country radio, the field where he first became a star.[332]\n\n\n\n### Vocal style and range[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn December 4, Presley dropped into Sun Records, where Carl Perkins and Jerry Lee Lewis were recording, and had an impromptu jam session along with Johnny Cash. Though Phillips no longer had the right to release any Presley material, he made sure that the session was captured on tape. The results, none officially released for twenty-five years, became known as the \"Million Dollar Quartet\" recordings.[119] The year ended with a front-page story in *The Wall Street Journal* reporting that Presley merchandise had brought in $22 million on top of his record sales,[120] and *Billboard*'s declaration that he had placed more songs in the top 100 than any other artist since records were first charted.[121] In his first full year at RCA Victor, then the record industry's largest company, Presley had accounted for over fifty percent of the label's singles sales.[112]\n\n\n\n#### Leiber and Stoller collaboration and draft notice[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Burke, Ken; Griffin, Dan (2006). *The Blue Moon Boys: The Story of Elvis Presley's Band*.

On the set of *Jailhouse Rock*, Presley granted Robinson an interview, though he was no longer dealing with the mainstream press. He denied making such a statement: \n\n\n> I never said anything like that, and people who know me know that I wouldn't have said it. ... A lot of people seem to think I started this business.

In February 1961, Presley performed two shows in Memphis, for a benefit for twenty-four local charities. During a luncheon preceding the event, RCA presented him with a plaque certifying worldwide sales of over 75 million records.[169] A twelve-hour Nashville session in mid-March yielded nearly all of Presley's next studio album, *Something for Everybody*.[170] According to John Robertson, it exemplifies the Nashville sound, the restrained, cosmopolitan style that would define country music in the 1960s. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPresley undertook three brief tours during the year, continuing to generate a crazed audience response.[130] A Detroit newspaper suggested that \"the trouble with going to see Elvis Presley is that you're liable to get killed\".[131] Villanova students pelted the singer with eggs in Philadelphia,[131] and in Vancouver the crowd rioted after the show ended, destroying the stage.[132] Frank Sinatra, who had inspired the swooning and screaming of teenage girls in the 1940s, decried rock and roll as \"brutal, ugly, degenerate, vicious. ... It fosters almost totally negative and destructive reactions in young people. It smells phoney and false. It is sung, played and written, for the most part, by cretinous goons. ... This rancid-smelling aphrodisiac I deplore.\"[133] Asked for a response, Presley said, \"I admire the man. He has a right to say what he wants to say.

Songwriters were obliged to forgo one-third of their customary royalties in exchange for having Presley perform their compositions.[75][c] By December, RCA had begun to heavily promote its new singer, and before month's end had reissued many of his Sun recordings.[78]\n\n\n\n### 1956–1958: commercial breakout and controversy[edit]\n\n\n#### First national TV appearances and debut album[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\"No,\" Presley said, \"that's the real king of rock and roll.\"[201] The next day, Parker's negotiations with the hotel resulted in a five-year contract for Presley to play each February and August, at an annual salary of $1 million.[202] *Newsweek* commented, \"There are several unbelievable things about Elvis, but the most incredible is his staying power in a world where meteoric careers fade like shooting stars.\"[203] *Rolling Stone* called Presley \"supernatural, his own resurrection.\"[204] In November, Presley's final non-concert film, *Change of Habit*, opened. The double album *From Memphis to Vegas/From Vegas to Memphis* came out the same month; the first LP consisted of live performances from the International, the second of more cuts from the American Sound sessions. \"Suspicious Minds\" reached the top of the charts—Presley's first U.S. pop number-one in over seven years, and his last.[205]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n> \n> I know he invented rock and roll, in a manner of speaking, but ... that's not why he's worshiped as a god today.

Released in June 1969, it was his first secular, non-soundtrack album from a dedicated period in the studio in eight years. As described by Marsh, it is \"a masterpiece in which Presley immediately catches up with pop music trends that had seemed to pass him by during the movie years. He sings country songs, soul songs and rockers with real conviction, a stunning achievement.\"[194] The album featured the hit single \"In the Ghetto\", issued in April, which reached number three on the pop chart—Presley's first non-gospel top ten hit since \"Bossa Nova Baby\" in 1963.

The Jackson 5 also performed at clubs and cocktail lounges, where striptease shows were featured, and at local auditoriums and high school dances.[32][33] In August 1967, while touring the East Coast, they won a weekly amateur night concert at the Apollo Theater in Harlem.[34]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Michael Jackson (center) as a member of the Jackson 5 in 1972.

Taylor produced some of their early Motown recordings, including a version of \"Who's Lovin' You\".[37] After signing with Motown, the Jackson family relocated to Los Angeles.[38] In 1969, Motown executives decided Diana Ross should introduce the Jackson 5 to the public — partly to bolster her career in television — sending off what was considered Motown's last product of its \"production line\".[39] The Jackson 5 made their first television appearance in 1969 in the Miss Black America pageant, performing a cover of \"It's Your Thing\".[40] *Rolling Stone* later described the young Michael as \"a prodigy\" with \"overwhelming musical gifts\" who \"quickly emerged as the main draw and lead singer\".[41]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nRock and Roll Hall of Fame –

The Jackson 5 also performed at clubs and cocktail lounges, where striptease shows were featured, and at local auditoriums and high school dances.[32][33] In August 1967, while touring the East Coast, they won a weekly amateur night concert at the Apollo Theater in Harlem.[34]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Michael Jackson (center) as a member of the Jackson 5 in 1972.

solo performer and helped him move from the bubblegum pop of his youth to more complex sounds.[44] It produced four top 10 entries in the US: \"Off the Wall\", \"She's Out of My Life\", and the chart-topping singles \"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough\" and \"Rock with You\".[59] The album reached number three on the US *Billboard* 200 and sold over 20 million copies worldwide.[60] In 1980, Jackson won three American Music Awards for his solo work: Favorite Soul/R&B Album, Favorite Soul/R&B Male Artist, and Favorite Soul/R&B Single for \"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough\".[61][62] He also won a Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance for 1979 with \"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough\".[63] In 1981, Jackson was the American Music Awards winner for Favorite Soul/R&B Album and Favorite Soul/R&B Male Artist.[64] Jackson felt *Off the Wall* should have made a bigger impact, and was determined to exceed expectations with his next release.[65] In 1980,

A one-man rescue team for the music business. A songwriter who sets the beat for a decade. A dancer with the fanciest feet on the street. A singer who cuts across all boundaries of taste and style, and color too.\"[91] In 2003, *The Daily Telegraph* writer Tom Utley described Jackson as \"extremely important\" and a \"genius\".[430] At Jackson's memorial service on July 7, 2009, Motown founder Berry Gordy called Jackson \"the greatest entertainer that ever lived\".[431][432] In a June 28, 2009 *Baltimore Sun* article, Jill Rosen wrote that Jackson's legacy influenced fields including sound, dance, fashion, music videos and celebrity.[433]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFollowing the surge in sales, in March 2010, Sony Music signed a $250 million deal (equivalent to $350 million in 2023) with the Jackson estate to extend their distribution rights to Jackson's back catalog until at least 2017; it had been due to expire in 2015. It was the most expensive music contract for a single artist in history.[347][348] They agreed to release ten albums of previously unreleased material and new collections of released work.[347][349] The deal was extended in 2017.[350] That July, a Los Angeles court awarded Quincy Jones $9.4 million of disputed royalty payments for *Off the Wall*, *Thriller*, and *Bad*.[56] In July 2018, Sony/ATV bought the estate's stake in EMI for $287.5 million.[351]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n170. **^** Gray, Chris; Shah, Saeed (October 3, 2002). \"Robbie swings historic record deal with EMI\". *The Independent*.

For much of Jackson's career, he had an unparalleled worldwide influence over the younger generation.[415] His influence extended beyond the music industry; he impacted dance, led fashion trends, and raised awareness for global affairs.[416] Jackson's music and videos fostered racial diversity in MTV's roster and steered its focus from rock to pop music and R&B, shaping the channel into a form that proved enduring.[44]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nGrammy Award for Album of the Year\n |\n| --- |\n| 1950s | * *The Music from Peter Gunn* – Henry Mancini (1958)\n* *Come Dance with Me!* – Frank Sinatra (1959)\n |\n| 1960s | * *The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart* – Bob Newhart (1960)\n* *Judy at Carnegie Hall* – Judy Garland (1961)\n* *The First Family* – Vaughn Meader (1962)\n* *The Barbra Streisand Album* – Barbra Streisand (1963)\n* *Getz/Gilberto* – Stan Getz & João Gilberto (1964)\n* *September of My Years* – Frank Sinatra (1965)\n* *A Man and His Music* – Frank Sinatra (1966)\n* *Sgt.

A one-man rescue team for the music business. A songwriter who sets the beat for a decade. A dancer with the fanciest feet on the street. A singer who cuts across all boundaries of taste and style and color too.\"[91] *The New York Times* wrote \"in the world of pop music, there is Michael Jackson and there is everybody else\".[92]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n253. **^** Marikar, Sheila; Friedman, Emily (June 29, 2009). \"Michael Jackson, King of Pop, Dead at 50\". *ABC News*.

It became the then most-watched Super Bowl halftime show in history with 114 million viewers, higher than the game itself.[269] During the event, she performed \"Give Me All Your Luvin'\", the lead single from her twelfth studio album, *MDNA*. It became her record-extending 38th top-ten single on the *Billboard* Hot 100.[270]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n178. **^** \"Top 100 47: American Pie\". BBC Radio 2.

[r]ather than try to croon and dance up a storm at the same time.\"[437] To allow for greater movement while dancing and singing, Madonna was one of the earliest adopters of hands-free radio-frequency headset microphones, with the headset fastened over the ears or the top of the head, and the microphone capsule on a boom arm that extended to the mouth. \n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_DEb6r5JyEOllvmjwhGgYyWFA","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

It caused the Russian Orthodox Church and the Federation of Jewish Communities of Russia to urge all their members to boycott her concert.[220] At the same time, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) announced officially that Madonna had sold over 200 million copies of her albums alone worldwide.[221]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMadonna has built a legacy that transcends music and has been studied by sociologists, historians, and other scholars, contributing to the rise of Madonna studies, a subfield of American cultural studies.[441][442][443] According to Rodrigo Fresán, \"saying that Madonna is just a pop star is as inappropriate as saying that Coca-Cola is just a soda.

These effects came at the expense of live singing.\"[436] Thor Christensen of *The Dallas Morning News* commented that while Madonna earned a reputation for lip-syncing during her 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour, she has subsequently reorganized her performances by \"stay[ing] mostly still during her toughest singing parts and [leaves] the dance routines to her backup troupe ... [r]ather than try to croon and dance up a storm at the same time.\"[437] To allow for greater movement while dancing and singing, Madonna was one of the earliest adopters of hands-free radio-frequency headset microphones, with the headset fastened over the ears or the top of the head, and the microphone capsule on a boom arm that extended to the mouth. \n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_DEb6r5JyEOllvmjwhGgYyWFA","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

I didn't ever want to be anything else. I'm more of a Little Richard stylist than a Jerry Lee Lewis, I think.

To celebrate five years since he had first appeared at the venue, in 1975, John played a two-night, four-show stand at the Troubadour. With seating limited to under 500 per show, the chance to purchase tickets was determined by a postcard lottery, with each winner allowed two tickets. Everyone who attended the performances received a hardbound \"yearbook\" of the band's history. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJohn has said he remembers being immediately hooked on rock and roll when his mother brought home records by Elvis Presley and Bill Haley & His Comets in 1956.[37][38] He also stated of when he was growing up: \"I heard Little Richard and Jerry Lee Lewis, and that was it. I didn't ever want to be anything else. I'm more of a Little Richard stylist than a Jerry Lee Lewis, I think. Jerry Lee is a very intricate piano player and very skillful, but Little Richard is more of a pounder.\"[322] John has also cited Ray Charles, the Beatles, the Band, Leon Russell, Aretha Franklin, Joni Mitchell and Freddie Mercury as influences.[323]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n342. **^** \"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road no. 91\". *Rolling Stone*.
