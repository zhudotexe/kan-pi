          "content": "<document>\n<title>Largest and heaviest animals</title>\n<content>\nThe **largest animal** currently alive is the blue whale. The maximum recorded weight was 190 tonnes for a specimen measuring 27.6 metres (91\u00a0ft), whereas longer ones, up to 33.6 metres (110\u00a0ft), have been recorded but not weighed.[1][2][3] It is estimated, this individual could have a mass of 250 tonnes.[4][5] The longest non-colonial animal is the lion's mane jellyfish (36.6m / 120\u00a0ft).[6]\n\n\nIn 2023, paleontologists estimated that the extinct whale *Perucetus*, discovered in Peru, may have outweighed the blue whale, with a mass of 85-340 t (84-335 long tons; 94-375 short tonnes.)[7] While controversial, estimates for the weight of the sauropod *Bruhathkayosaurus* suggest it was around 110-170 tons, with the highest estimate being 240 tons, if scaled with *Patagotitan*, although actual fossil remains no longer exist, and that estimation is based on described dimensions in 1987.[8] The upper estimates of weight for these two prehistoric animals would have easily rivaled or exceeded the blue whale. \n\n\nThe African bush elephant (*Loxodonta africana*) is the largest living land animal. A native of various open habitats in sub-Saharan Africa, males weigh about 6.0 tonnes (13,200\u00a0lb) on average.[9] The largest elephant ever recorded was shot in Angola in 1974. It was a male measuring 10.67 metres (35.0\u00a0ft) from trunk to tail and 4.17 metres (13.7\u00a0ft) lying on its side in a projected line from the highest point of the shoulder, to the base of the forefoot, indicating a standing shoulder height of 3.96 metres (13.0\u00a0ft). This male had a computed weight of 10.4 tonnes.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## Heaviest living animals[edit]\n\n\nThe heaviest living animals are all whales. Since no scale can accommodate the whole body of a large whale, most have been weighed by parts.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Animal\n | Average mass[tonnes]\n | Maximum mass[tonnes]\n | Average total length[m (ft)]\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Blue whale | 110[10] | 190[1] | 24 (79)[11] |\n| 2 | North Pacific right whale | 60[12] | 120[1] | 15.5 (51)[10] |\n| 3 | Southern right whale | 58[10] | 110[13] | 15.25 (50)[10] |\n| 4 | Fin whale | 57[10] | 120[13] | 19.5 (64)[10] |\n| 5 | Bowhead whale | 54.5[10][14] | 120[1] | 15 (49)[10] |\n| 6 | North Atlantic right whale | 54[10][15] | 110[13][16] | 15 (49)[10][16] |\n| 7 | Sperm whale | 31.25[10][17] | 80[1] | 13.25 (43.5)[10][17] |\n| 8 | Humpback whale | 29[10][18] | 48[19] | 13.5 (44)[10] |\n| 9 | Sei whale | 22.5[10] | 45[20] | 14.8 (49)[10] |\n| 10 | Gray whale | 19.5[10] | 45[21] | 13.5 (44)[10] |\n\n\n![](image)Infographic showing the size of marine megafauna.\n![](image)The blue whale is the heaviest living animal.\n## Heaviest terrestrial animals[edit]\n\n\nThe heaviest land animals are all mammals.

At the highest estimates, this would make *Perucetus* the heaviest known animal in history.[7]\n\n\nThe largest land mammal extant today is the African bush elephant. The largest extinct land mammal known was long considered to be *Paraceratherium orgosensis*, a rhinoceros relative thought to have stood up to 4.8\u00a0m (15.7\u00a0ft) tall, measured over 7.4\u00a0m (24.3\u00a0ft) long and may have weighed about 17 tonnes.[55][56] In 2015, a study suggested that one example of the proboscidean *Palaeoloxodon namadicus* may have been the largest land mammal ever, based on extensive research of fragmentary leg bone fossils from one individual, with a maximum estimated size of 22 tonnes.[57][55]\n\n\n\n### Stem-mammals (Synapsida)[edit]\n\n\nThe Late Triassic *Lisowicia bojani*, from what is now southern Poland, probably was the largest of all non-mammalian synapsids (most of which became extinct 250 million years ago), at 4.5\u00a0m (15\u00a0ft) in length, 2.6\u00a0m (8.5\u00a0ft) in height and 9\u00a0t (20,000\u00a0lb) in weight.[58] However, one study suggested a more conservative weight of 4.87 tonnes to 7.02 tonnes for the adult taxon, with an average body mass of 5.88 tonnes.[59] The largest carnivorous synapsid was *Anteosaurus* at 5\u20136\u00a0m (16\u201320\u00a0ft) and 500\u2013600\u00a0kg (1,100\u20131,300\u00a0lb).[60]\n\n\n\nCaseasaurs (Caseasauria)\nThe herbivorous *Alierasaurus* was the largest caseid and the largest amniote to have lived at the time, with an estimated length around 6\u20137\u00a0m (20\u201323\u00a0ft).[61] Another huge caseasaur is *Cotylorhynchus hancocki*, with an estimated length and weight of at least 6\u00a0m (20\u00a0ft)[62] and more than 500\u00a0kg (1,100\u00a0lb).[63]\nSphenacodontids (Sphenacodontidae)\nThe biggest carnivorous synapsid of Early Permian was *Dimetrodon*, which could reach 4.6\u00a0m (15\u00a0ft) and 250\u00a0kg (550\u00a0lb).[64] The largest members of the genus *Dimetrodon* were also the world's first fully terrestrial apex predators.[65]\nTappenosaurids (Tappenosauridae)\nThe Middle Permian *Tappenosaurus* was estimated at 5.5\u00a0m (18\u00a0ft) in length which is comparable in size with the largest dinocephalians.[66]\nTherapsids (Therapsida)\nThe plant-eating dicynodont *Lisowicia bojani* is the largest-known of all non-mammalian synapsids, at 4.5\u00a0m (15\u00a0ft) and 9,000\u00a0kg (20,000\u00a0lb).[58][67][68] The largest carnivorous therapsid was the aforementioned *Anteosaurus* from what is now South Africa during Middle Permian epoch. It reached 5\u20136\u00a0m (16\u201320\u00a0ft) long, and about 500\u2013600\u00a0kg (1,100\u20131,300\u00a0lb) in weight.[60]\n### Reptiles (Reptilia)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of largest reptiles\n\n![](image)The saltwater crocodile is the largest living reptile.\nThe largest living reptile, a representative of the order Crocodilia, is the saltwater crocodile (*Crocodylus porosus*) of Southern Asia and Australia, with adult males being typically 3.9\u20135.5\u00a0m (13\u201318\u00a0ft) long. The largest confirmed saltwater crocodile on record was 6.32\u00a0m (20.7\u00a0ft) long, and weighed about 1,360\u00a0kg (3,000\u00a0lb).[1] Unconfirmed reports of much larger crocodiles exist, but examinations of incomplete remains have never suggested a length greater than 7\u00a0m (23\u00a0ft).[69] Also, a living specimen estimated at 7\u00a0m (23\u00a0ft) and 2,000\u00a0kg (4,400\u00a0lb) has been accepted by the Guinness Book of World Records.[70] However, due to the difficulty of trapping and measuring a very large living crocodile, the accuracy of these dimensions has yet to be verified. A specimen named Lolong caught alive in the Philippines in 2011 (died February 2013) was found to have measured 6.17\u00a0m (20.2\u00a0ft) in length.[71][72][73][74][75]\n\n\nThe Komodo dragon (*Varanus komodoensis*), also known as the \"Komodo monitor\", is a large species of lizard found in the Indonesian islands of Komodo, Rinca, Flores, Gili Motang, Nusa kode and Padar. A member of the monitor lizard family (Varanidae), it is the largest living species of lizard, growing to a maximum length of more than 3 metres (9.8 feet) in rare cases and weighing up to approximately 166 kilograms (366 pounds).[76]\n\n\n\n#### Largest living reptiles[edit]\n\n\nThe following is a list of the largest living reptile species ranked by average weight, which is dominated by the crocodilians.

The tallest and heaviest sauropod known from a complete skeleton is a specimen of an immature *Giraffatitan* discovered in Tanzania between 1907 and 1912, now mounted in the Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde of Berlin. It is 12\u201313.27\u00a0m (39.4\u201343.5\u00a0ft) tall and weighed 23.3\u201339.5 tonnes.[110][111][112][113][114][115] The longest is a 25\u00a0m (82\u00a0ft) long specimen of *Diplodocus* discovered in Wyoming, and mounted in Pittsburgh's Carnegie Natural History Museum in 1907. A *Patagotitan* specimen found in Argentina in 2014 is estimated to have been 37\u201340\u00a0m (121\u2013131\u00a0ft) long and 20\u00a0m (66\u00a0ft) tall, with a weight of 69\u201377 tonnes.[116][117]\nThere were larger sauropods, but they are known only from a few bones. The current record-holders include *Argentinosaurus*, which may have weighed 100 tonnes; *Supersaurus* which might have reached 34\u00a0m (112\u00a0ft) in length and *Sauroposeidon* which might have been 18\u00a0m (59\u00a0ft) tall. Some abnormal specimens such as specimen BYU 9024 of the *Barosaurus* genus could reach an astounding 45-48 meters long, with mass varying from the 'modest' 60-66 tons to the more immense 92-120 tons.[118][119][120] Two other such sauropods include *Bruhathkayosaurus* and *Maraapunisaurus*. Both are known only from fragments that are no longer exist. *Bruhathkayosaurus* might have been between 40\u201344\u00a0m (131\u2013144\u00a0ft) in length and 175\u2013220 tonnes in weight according to some estimates, with recent estimates being place between 110-170 tons.[121][8] *Maraapunisaurus* might have been approximately 35\u201340\u00a0m long and 80\u2013120 tonnes or more.[122] Each of these two 'super-sauropods' would have easily rivalled the largest blue whale in size.[8]\n\n\n| Rank\n | Animal\n | Average mass[tonnes]\n | Maximum mass[tonnes]\n | Average total length[m (ft)]\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Bruhathkayosaurus matleyi | 110-170[8] | 240[8] | 44.1 (144.6)[123][124] |\n| 2 | Maraapunisaurus fragillimus | 80-120[125] | 150[126] | 35-40 (115-131)[125] |\n| 3 | Barosaurus lentus BYU 9024 | 60-66[118][119][127][128] | 92-120[120] | 45-48 (148-157)[128] |\n| 4 | Argentinosaurus huinculensis | 75-80[113] | 100[113][129] | 35\u201339.7 (115\u2013130)[113][130] |\n| 5 | Mamenchisaurus | 50-80[131] | 80[131] | 26\u201335 (85\u2013115)[131] |\n| 6 | Notocolossus gonzalezparejasi | 44.9\u201375.9[129] | 75.9[129] | 28 (92)[129] |\n| 7 | Patagotitan mayorum | 55-69[132] | 77[132] | 33\u201337 (108\u2013121)[132] |\n| 8 | Puertasaurus reuili | 50-60[133] | 60 | 27-30 (89-98)[134][135][136] |\n| 9 | Sauroposeidon proteles | 40-60[137] | 60[137] | 27\u201334 (89\u2013112)[137][133][138] |\n| 10 | Dreadnoughtus schrani | 22.1\u201359.3[139] | 59.3[139] | 26 (85)[129][139] |\n\n\nTheropods (Theropoda)\nThe largest theropod known from a nearly complete skeleton is the most complete *Tyrannosaurus* *rex* specimen, nicknamed \"Sue\", which was discovered in South Dakota in 1990 and now mounted in the Field Museum of Chicago at a total length of 12.3\u00a0m (40\u00a0ft). Body mass estimates have reached over 9,500\u00a0kg,[140] though other figures, such as Hartman's 2013 estimate of 8,400\u00a0kg,[141] have been lower.\nAnother giant theropod is *Spinosaurus aegyptiacus* from the mid-Cretaceous of North Africa. Size estimates have been fluctuating far more over the years, with length estimates ranging from 12.6 to 18 m and mass estimates from 7 to 20.9 t.[142][143] Recent findings favor a length exceeding 15 m [144] and a body mass of 7.5 tons.[145]\nOther contenders known from partial skeletons include *Giganotosaurus carolinii* (est. 12.2\u201313.2 m and 6-13.8 tonnes) and *Carcharodontosaurus saharicus* (est. 12-13.3 m and 6.2-15.1 tonnes).[143][146][147][148][149][118]\nThe largest extant theropod is the common ostrich (see birds, below).\nArmored dinosaurs (Thyreophora)\nThe largest thyreophorans were *Ankylosaurus* and *Stegosaurus*, from the Late Cretaceous and Late Jurassic periods (respectively) of what is now North America, both measuring up to 9\u00a0m (30\u00a0ft) in length and estimated to weigh up to 6 tonnes.[150][151]\nOrnithopods (Ornithopoda)\nThe largest ornithopods were the hadrosaurids *Shantungosaurus*, a late Cretaceous dinosaur found in the Shandong Peninsula of China, and *Magnapaulia* from the late Cretaceous of North America. Both species are known from fragmentary remains but are estimated to have reached over 15\u00a0m (49\u00a0ft) in length[152][153] and were likely the heaviest non-sauropod dinosaurs, estimated at over 23\u00a0tonnes.[153]\nCeratopsians (Ceratopsia)\nThe largest ceratopsians were *Triceratops* and its ancestor *Eotriceratops* from the late Cretaceous of North America. Both estimated to have reached about 9\u00a0m (30\u00a0ft) in length[154] and weighed 12\u00a0tonnes.[155][156]\n#### Birds (Aves)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of largest birds\n\n![](image)The common ostrich is the largest living bird.\nThe largest living bird, a member of the Struthioniformes, is the common ostrich (*Struthio camelus*), from the plains of Africa. A large male ostrich can reach a height of 2.8\u00a0m (9.2\u00a0ft) and weigh over 156\u00a0kg (344\u00a0lb).[157] A mass of 200\u00a0kg (440\u00a0lb) has been cited for the common ostrich but no wild ostriches of this weight have been verified.[158] Eggs laid by the ostrich can weigh 1.4\u00a0kg (3.1\u00a0lb) and are the largest eggs in the world today.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe largest bird in the fossil record may be the extinct elephant birds (Aepyornithidae) of Madagascar, which were related to the kiwis. *Aepyornis* exceeded 3\u00a0m (9.8\u00a0ft) in height and 500\u00a0kg (1,100\u00a0lb), while *Vorombe* could reach a similar height and a mass of 732\u00a0kg (1,614\u00a0lb).[159] The last of the elephant birds became extinct about 300 years ago. Of almost exactly the same upper proportions as the largest elephant birds was *Dromornis stirtoni* of Australia, part of a 26,000-year-old group called mihirungs of the family Dromornithidae.[160] The largest carnivorous bird was *Brontornis*, an extinct flightless bird from South America which reached a weight of 350 to 400\u00a0kg (770 to 880\u00a0lb) and a height of about 2.8\u00a0m (9\u00a0ft 2\u00a0in).[161] The tallest carnivorous bird was *Kelenken*, which could reach 3 to 3.2 meters in height and 220 to 250 kilograms. The tallest bird ever was the giant moa (*Dinornis maximus*), part of the moa family of New Zealand that went extinct around 1500 AD. This particular species of moa stood up to 3.7\u00a0m (12\u00a0ft) tall,[157] but weighed about half as much as a large elephant bird or mihirung due to its comparatively slender frame.[1]\n\n\nThe heaviest bird ever capable of flight was *Argentavis magnificens*, the largest member of the now extinct family Teratornithidae, found in Miocene-aged fossil beds of Argentina, with a wingspan up to 5.5\u00a0m (18\u00a0ft), a length of up to 1.25\u00a0m (4.1\u00a0ft), a height on the ground of up to 1.75\u00a0m (5.7\u00a0ft) and a body weight of at least 71\u00a0kg (157\u00a0lb).[1][162][163] *Pelagornis sandersi* is thought to have had an even larger wingspan of about 6.1\u20137.4\u00a0m (20\u201324\u00a0ft), but is only about 22\u201340\u00a0kg (49\u201388\u00a0lb), half the mass of the former.[164][163]\n\n\n\n##### Heaviest living bird species[edit]\n\n\nThe following is a list of the heaviest living bird species based on maximum reported or reliable mass, but average weight is also given for comparison. These species are almost all flightless, which allows for these particular birds to have denser bones and heavier bodies. Flightless birds comprise less than 2% of all living bird species.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Animal\n | Binomial Name\n | Average mass[kg (lb)]\n | Maximum mass[kg (lb)]\n | Average total length[cm (ft)]\n | Flighted |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Common ostrich | *Struthio camelus* | 104 (230)[165] | 156.8 (346)[165] | 210 (6.9)[166] | No\n |\n| 2 | Somali ostrich | *Struthio molybdophanes* | 90 (200)[165] | 130 (287)[*citation needed*] | 200 (6.6)[165] | No\n |\n| 3 | Southern cassowary | *Casuarius casuarius* | 45 (99)[165] | 85 (190)[167] | 155 (5.1)[165] | No\n |\n| 4 | Northern cassowary | *Casuarius unappendiculatus* | 44 (97)[165] | 75 (170)[165] | 149 (4.9)[166] | No\n |\n| 5 | Emu | *Dromaius novaehollandiae* | 33 (73)[165][168] | 70 (150)[*citation needed*] | 153 (5)[165] | No\n |\n| 6 | Emperor penguin | *Aptenodytes forsteri* | 31.5 (69)[166][169] | 46 (100)[166] | 114 (3.7)[166] | No\n |\n| 7 | Greater rhea | *Rhea americana* | 23 (51)[168] | 40 (88)[166] | 134 (4.4)[165] | No\n |\n| 8 | Domestic turkey/wild turkey | *Meleagris gallopavo* | 13.5 (29.8) [170] | 39 (86)[171] | 100 - 124.9 (3.3 \u2013 4.1)[*citation needed*] | Yes\n |\n| 9 | Dwarf cassowary | *Casuarius bennetti* | 19.7 (43)[165] | 34 (75)[165] | 105 (3.4)[*citation needed*] | No\n |\n| 10 | Lesser rhea | *Rhea pennata* | 19.6 (43)[165] | 28.6 (63)[165] | 96 (3.2)[166] | No\n |\n| 11 | Mute swan | *Cygnus olor* | 11.87 (26.2) | 23 (51) | 100-130 (3.3 - 4.3)[172] | Yes\n |\n| 12 | Great bustard | *Otis tarda* | 10.6 (23.4)[*citation needed*] | 21 (46)[1] | 115 (3.8)[*citation needed*] | Yes\n |\n| 13 | King penguin | *Aptenodytes patagonicus* | 13.6 (30)[166][169] | 20 (44)[173] | 92 (3)[*citation needed*] | No\n |\n| 14 | Kori bustard | *Ardeotis kori* | 11.4 (25.1)[166] | 20 (44.1)[*citation needed*] | 150 (5)[166] | Yes\n |\n| 15 | Trumpeter swan | *Cygnus buccinator* | 11.6 (25.1) | 17.2 (38) | 138 - 165 (4.5 - 5.4) | Yes\n |\n| 16 | Wandering albatross | *Diomedea exulans* | 11.9 (24) | 16.1 (38)[174] | 107 - 135 (3.5 - 4.4) | Yes\n |\n| 17 | Whooper swan | *Cygnus cygnus* | 11.4 (25) | 15.5 (32) | 140 - 165 (4.5 - 5.4) | Yes\n |\n| 18 | Dalmatian Pelican | *Pelecanus crispus* | 11.5 (25) | 15 (33.1)[*citation needed*] | 183 (6)[*citation needed*] | Yes\n |\n| 19 | Andean condor | *Vultur gryphus* | 11.3 (25)[172] | 14.9 (33)[172] | 100 - 130 (3.3 - 4.3)[172] | Yes\n |\n\n\n### Amphibians (Amphibia)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A giant salamander, the largest living amphibian.\nThe largest living amphibian is the South China giant salamander (*Andrias sligoi*).

The largest known was the crocodile-like *Prionosuchus*, which reached a length of 9\u00a0m (30\u00a0ft).[175]\n\n\n\nFrogs (Anura)\n![](image)The massive and destructive cane toad ranks as the largest toad in the world.\nThe largest member of the largest order of amphibians is the African goliath frog (*Conraua goliath*). The maximum size this species is verified to attain is a weight of 3.8\u00a0kg (8.4\u00a0lb) and a snout-to-vent length of 39\u00a0cm (15\u00a0in).[1] The largest of the toads, the cane toad (*Rhinella marina*), is also the second largest member of the frog order. This infamous, often invasive species can grow to maximum mass of 2.65\u00a0kg (5.8\u00a0lb) and measure a maximum of 33\u00a0cm (13\u00a0in) from snout-to-vent.[1] Rivaling the previous two species, the African bullfrog (*Pyxicephalus adspersus*) can range up to a weight of 2\u00a0kg (4.4\u00a0lb) and 25.5\u00a0cm (10.0\u00a0in) from snout to vent.[176] Another large frog is the largest frog in North America, the American bullfrog, which can reach weights of up to 0.8\u00a0kg (1.8\u00a0lb) and snout-to-vent-length (SVL) of 20\u00a0cm (7.9\u00a0in). However, the toad *Beelzebufo ampinga*, found in fossil from the Cretaceous era in what is now Madagascar, was estimated to grow to 41\u00a0cm (16\u00a0in) long and weigh up to 4.5\u00a0kg (9.9\u00a0lb), making it the largest frog ever known.[177] But in more recent studies, animals of this species have been estimated to have grown to at least 23.2\u00a0cm (9.1\u00a0in) (snout-vent length), which is around the size a modern African bullfrog can reach.[178] The largest tree frog is the Australasian white-lipped tree frog (*Litoria infrafrenata*), the females of which can reach a length of 14\u00a0cm (5.5\u00a0in) from snout to vent and can weigh up to 115\u00a0g (4.1\u00a0oz).[179] The family Leptodactylidae, one of the most diverse anuran families, also has some very large members. The largest is the Surinam horned frog (*Ceratophrys cornuta*), which can reach 20\u00a0cm (7.9\u00a0in) in length from snout to vent and weigh up to 0.48\u00a0kg (1.1\u00a0lb).[180] While not quite as large as *Ceratophrys cornuta*, *Leptodactylus pentadactylus* is often heavier; it can reach 18.5\u00a0cm (7.3\u00a0in) long and weigh 0.60 kilograms (1.3 pounds). The largest dendrobatid is the Colombian golden poison frog (*Phyllobates terribilis*), which can attain a length of 6\u00a0cm (2.4\u00a0in) and nearly 28.3\u00a0g (1.00\u00a0oz).[181] Most frogs are classified under the suborder Neobatrachia, although nearly 200 species are part of the suborder Mesobatrachia, or ancient frogs. The largest of these are the little-known *Brachytarsophrys* or Karin Hills frogs, of South Asia, which can grow to a maximum snout-to-vent length of 17\u00a0cm (6.7\u00a0in) and a maximum weight of 0.54\u00a0kg (1.2\u00a0lb).[182]\nCaecilians (Gymnophiona)\nThe largest of the worm-like caecilians is the Colombian Thompson's caecilian (*Caecilia thompsoni*), which reaches a length of 1.5\u00a0m (4.9\u00a0ft), a width of about 4.6\u00a0cm (1.8\u00a0in) and can weigh up to about 1\u00a0kg (2.2\u00a0lb).[1]\nSalamanders (Urodela)\nBesides the previously mentioned Chinese and South China giant salamanders, the closely related Japanese giant salamander (*Andrias japonicus*) is also sometimes cited as the largest living amphibian, but salamanders of a greater size than 1.53\u00a0m (5.0\u00a0ft) and 36\u00a0kg (79\u00a0lb) have never been verified for this species. Another giant of the amphibian world is the North American hellbender (*Cryptobranchus alleganiensis*), which can measure up to 0.76\u00a0m (2.5\u00a0ft). The recently described reticulated siren of the southeastern United States rivals the hellbender in size, although it is more lean in build.[183] The largest of the newts is the Iberian ribbed newt (*Pleurodeles waltl*), which can grow up to 30\u00a0cm (12\u00a0in) in length.[184]\n### Fish[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of largest fish\n\n## Invertebrate chordates[edit]\n\n\n### Tunicates (Tunicata)[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Tunicata\n\nThe largest tunicates are *Synoicum pulmonaria*, found at depths of 20 and 40 metres (66 and 131\u00a0ft), and are up to 14 centimetres (6\u00a0in) in diameter. It is also present in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean, around the coasts of Greenland and Newfoundland, but is less common here than in the east, and occurs only at depths between 10 and 13 metres (33 and 43\u00a0ft).[185]\n\n\n\nEntergonas (Enterogona)\nThe largest entergonas *Synoicum pulmonaria* it is usually found at depths between about 20 and 40 metres (66 and 131\u00a0ft) and can grow to over a metre (yard) in length. It is also present in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean, around the coasts of Greenland and Newfoundland, but is less common here than in the east, and occurs only at depths between 10 and 13 metres (33 and 43\u00a0ft).[185]\nPleurogonas (Pleurogona)\nThe largest pleurogonas: *Pyura pachydermatina* .[186] In colour it is off-white or a garish shade of reddish-purple. The stalk is two thirds to three quarters the length of the whole animal which helps distinguish it from certain invasive tunicates not native to New Zealand such as *Styela clava* and *Pyura stolonifera*.[187] It is one of the largest species of tunicates and can grow to over a metre (yard) in length.[188]\nAspiraculates (Aspiraculata)\nThe largest aspiraculates: *Oligotrema* large and surrounded by six large lobes; the cloacal syphon is small. They live exclusively in deep water and range in size from less than one inch (2 cm) to 2.4 inches (6 cm).\n#### Thaliacea[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The *Pyrosoma atlanticum* is the largest thaliacean.\nThe largest thaliacean, *Pyrosoma atlanticum*, is cylindrical and can grow up to 60\u00a0cm (2\u00a0ft) long and 4\u20136\u00a0cm wide. The constituent zooids form a rigid tube, which may be pale pink, yellowish, or bluish. One end of the tube is narrower and is closed, while the other is open and has a strong diaphragm. The outer surface or test is gelatinised and dimpled with backward-pointing, blunt processes. The individual zooids are up to 8.5\u00a0mm (0.33\u00a0in) long and have a broad, rounded branchial sac with gill slits. Along the side of the branchial sac runs the endostyle, which produces mucus filters. Water is moved through the gill slits into the centre of the cylinder by cilia pulsating rhythmically. Plankton and other food particles are caught in mucus filters in the processes as the colony is propelled through the water. *P. atlanticum* is bioluminescent and can generate a brilliant blue-green light when stimulated.[189][190]\n\n\n\nDoliolida (Doliolida)\nThe largest doliolida: *Doliolida* [191] The doliolid body is small, typically 1\u20132\u00a0cm long, and barrel-shaped; it features two wide siphons, one at the front and the other at the back end, and eight or nine circular muscle strands reminiscent of barrel bands. Like all tunicates, they are filter feeders. They are free-floating; the same forced flow of water through their bodies with which they gather plankton is used for propulsion - not unlike a tiny ramjet engine. Doliolids are capable of quick movement. They have a complicated lifecycle consisting of sexual and asexual generations. They are nearly exclusively tropical animals, although a few species are found as far north as northern California.[*citation needed*]\nSalps (Salpida)\nThe largest salps: *Cyclosalpa bakeri* 15cm (6ins) long. There are openings at the anterior and posterior ends of the cylinder which can be opened or closed as needed. The bodies have seven transverse bands of muscle interspersed by white, translucent patches. A stolon grows from near the endostyle (an elongated glandular structure producing mucus for trapping food particles). The stolon is a ribbon-like organ on which a batch of aggregate forms of the animal are produced by budding. The aggregate is the second, colonial form of the salp and is also gelatinous, transparent and flabby. It takes the shape of a radial whorl of individuals up to about 20cm (4in) in diameter. It is formed of approximately 12 zooids linked side by side in a shape that resembles a crown.[189][192] are largest thetyses: *Thetys vagina* Individuals can reach up to 30\u00a0cm (12\u00a0in) long.[*citation needed*]\nLarvaceans (Larvacea)\nThe largest larvaceans: *Appendicularia* 1\u00a0cm (0.39\u00a0in) in body length (excluding the tail).[*citation needed*]\n### Cephalochordates (Leptocardii)[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Leptocardii\n\nThe largest lancelet is the European lancelet (*Branchiostoma lanceolatum*) \"primitive fish\". It can grow up to 6\u00a0cm (2.5\u00a0in) long.[193]\n\n\n\n## Invertebrate non-chordates[edit]\n\n\n### Echinoderms (Echinodermata)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)At up to 3\u00a0m (9.8\u00a0ft) long, the sea cucumber *Synapta maculata* is the longest known echinoderm.\nThe largest species of echinoderm in terms of bulk is probably the starfish species *Thromidia gigas*, of the class Asteroidea, which reaches a weight of over 6\u00a0kg (13\u00a0lb),[194] but it might be beaten by some giant sea cucumbers such as *Thelenota anax*. However, at a maximum span of 63\u00a0cm (25\u00a0in), *Thromidia gigas* is quite a bit shorter than some other echinoderms.[1] The longest echinoderm known is the conspicuous sea cucumber *Synapta maculata*, with a slender body that can extend up to 3\u00a0m (9.8\u00a0ft). In comparison, the biggest sea star is the brisingid sea star *Midgardia xandaros*, reaching a span of 1.4\u00a0m (4.6\u00a0ft), despite being quite slender.[1] *Evasterias echinosoma* is another giant echinoderm and can measure up to 1\u00a0m (3.3\u00a0ft) across and weigh 5.1\u00a0kg (11\u00a0lb).[1]\n\n\n\nCrinoids (Crinoidea)\nThe largest species of crinoid is the unstalked feather-star *Heliometra glacialis*, reaching a total width of 78\u00a0cm (31\u00a0in) and an individual arm length of 35\u00a0cm (14\u00a0in). A width of 91.4\u00a0cm (36.0\u00a0in) was claimed for one unstalked feather-star but is not confirmed.[1] The genus *Metacrinus* has a stalk span of 61\u00a0cm (24\u00a0in) but, due to its bulk and multiple arms, it is heavier than *Heliometra*.[1] In the past, crinoids grew much larger, and stalk lengths up to 40\u00a0m (130\u00a0ft) have been found in the fossil record.[195]\nSea urchins and allies (Echinoidea)\nThe largest sea urchin is the species *Sperosoma giganteum* from the deep northwest Pacific Ocean, which can reach a shell width of about 30\u00a0cm (12\u00a0in).[196] Another deep sea species *Hygrosoma hoplacantha* is only slightly smaller.[196] The largest species found along the North America coast is the Pacific red sea urchin (*Mesocentrotus franciscanus*) where the shell can reach 19\u00a0cm (7.5\u00a0in).[197] If the spines enter into count, the biggest species may be a Diadematidae like *Diadema setosum*, with a test up to 10\u00a0cm (3.9\u00a0in) only, but its spines can reach up to 30\u00a0cm (12\u00a0in) in length.[198]\nSea cucumbers (Holothuroidea)\nThe bulkiest species of sea cucumber are *Stichopus variegatus* and *Thelenota anax*, weighing several pounds, being about 21\u00a0cm (8.3\u00a0in) in diameter, and reaching a length of 1\u00a0m (3.3\u00a0ft) when fully extended. *Synapta maculata* can reach an extended length of 3\u00a0m (9.8\u00a0ft), but is extremely slender (3-5cm) and weigh much less than Stichopodids.[1]\nBrittle stars (Ophiuroidea)\nThe largest known specimen of brittle star is the basket star *Astrotoma agassizii*. This species can grow to have a span of 1\u00a0m (3.3\u00a0ft).[1] Sometimes, *Gorgonocephalus stimpsoni* is considered the largest but the maximum this species is can measure 70\u00a0cm (28\u00a0in) and a disk diameter of about 14.3\u00a0cm (5.6\u00a0in). Outside from euryalids, the biggest ophiurid brittle star may be *Ophiopsammus maculata* (6\u20137 inches).[199]\nSea stars (Asteroidea)\nThe heaviest sea star is *Thromidia gigas* from the Indo-Pacific, which can surpass 6\u00a0kg (13\u00a0lb) in weight, but only has a diameter of about 65\u00a0cm (2.13\u00a0ft).[194][196] Despite its relatively small disk and weight, the long slender arms of *Midgardia xandaros* from the Gulf of California makes it the sea star with the largest diameter at about 1.4\u00a0m (4.5\u00a0ft).[196] *Mithrodia clavigera* may also become wider than 1\u00a0m (39\u00a0in) in some cases, with stout arms.[*citation needed*]\n### Flatworms (Platyhelminthes)[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Platyhelminthes\n\nMonogenean flatworms (Monogenea)\nThe largest known members of this group of very small parasites are among the genus of capsalids, *Listrocephalos*, reaching a length of 2\u00a0cm (0.79\u00a0in).[200]\nFlukes (Trematoda)\nThe largest known species of fluke is *Fasciolopsis buski*, which most often attacks humans and livestock. One of these flukes can be up to 7.5\u00a0cm (3.0\u00a0in) long and 2\u00a0cm (0.79\u00a0in) thick.[201]\nTapeworms (Cestoda)\nThe largest known species of tapeworm is the whale tapeworm, *Polygonoporus giganticus*, which can grow to over 30\u00a0m (98\u00a0ft).[202][203]\n### Segmented worms (Annelida)[edit]\n\n\nThe largest of the segmented worms (including earthworms, leeches, and polychaetes) is the African giant earthworm (*Microchaetus rappi*). Although it averages about 1.36\u00a0m (4.5\u00a0ft) in length, this huge worm can reach a length of as much as 6.7\u00a0m (22\u00a0ft) and can weigh over 1.5\u00a0kg (3.3\u00a0lb).[204] Only the giant Gippsland earthworm, *Megascolides australis*, and a few giant polychaetes, including the notorious *Eunice aphroditois*, reach nearly comparable sizes, reaching 4 and 3.6\u00a0m (13 and 12\u00a0ft), respectively.[1]\n\n\n\n### Ribbon worms (Nemertea)[edit]\n\n\nThe largest nemertean is the bootlace worm, *Lineus longissimus*. A specimen found washed ashore on a beach in St. Andrews, Scotland in 1864 was recorded at a length of 55\u00a0m (180\u00a0ft).[205]\n\n\n\n### Mollusks (Mollusca)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A 7\u00a0m (23\u00a0ft) giant squid, the second largest of all invertebrates, encased in ice in the Melbourne Aquarium.\nBoth the largest mollusks and the largest of all invertebrates (in terms of mass) are the largest squids. The colossal squid (*Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni*) is projected to be the largest invertebrate.[206] Current estimates put its maximum size at 12 to 14\u00a0m (39 to 46\u00a0ft) long and 750\u00a0kg (1,650\u00a0lb),[207] based on analysis of smaller specimens. In 2007, authorities in New Zealand announced the capture of the largest known colossal squid specimen. It was initially thought to be 10\u00a0m (33\u00a0ft) and 450\u00a0kg (990\u00a0lb). It was later measured at 4.2\u00a0m (14\u00a0ft) long and 495\u00a0kg (1,091\u00a0lb) in weight. The mantle was 2.5\u00a0m (8.2\u00a0ft) long when measured.[208][209]\n\n\nThe giant squid (*Architeuthis dux*) was previously thought to be the largest squid, and while it is less massive and has a smaller mantle than the colossal squid, it may exceed the colossal squid in overall length including tentacles. One giant squid specimen that washed ashore in 1878 in Newfoundland reportedly measured 16.8\u00a0m (55\u00a0ft) in total length (from the tip of the mantle to the end of the long tentacles), head and body length 6.1\u00a0m (20\u00a0ft), 4.6\u00a0m (15\u00a0ft) in circumference at the thickest part of mantle, and weighed about 900\u00a0kg (2,000\u00a0lb). This specimen is still often cited as the largest invertebrate that has ever been examined.[1][210][211] However, no animals approaching this size have been scientifically documented and, according to giant squid expert Steve O'Shea, such lengths were likely achieved by greatly stretching the two tentacles like elastic bands.[212]\n\n\n\nAplacophorans (Aplacophora)\nThe largest known of these worm-like, shell-less mollusks are represented in the genus *Epimenia*, which can reach 30\u00a0cm (12\u00a0in) long. Most aplacophorans are less than 5\u00a0cm (2.0\u00a0in) long.[213]\nChitons (Polyplacophora)\nThe largest of the chitons is the gumboot chiton, *Cryptochiton stelleri*, which can reach a length of 33\u00a0cm (13\u00a0in) and weigh over 2\u00a0kg (4.4\u00a0lb).[214]\n![](image)The mouth of a mostly hidden giant clam, the largest bivalve\nBivalves (Bivalvia)\nThe largest of the bivalve mollusks is the giant clam, *Tridacna gigas*. Although even larger sizes have been reported for this passive animal, the top verified size was for a specimen from the Great Barrier Reef. This creature weighed 270\u00a0kg (600\u00a0lb), had an axial length of 1.14\u00a0m (3.7\u00a0ft) and depth of 0.75\u00a0m (2.5\u00a0ft).[1] The largest bivalve ever was *Platyceramus platinus*, a Cretaceous giant that reached an axial length of up to 3\u00a0m (nearly 10\u00a0ft).[215]\nGastropods (Gastropoda)\nThe \"largest\" of this most diverse and successful mollusk class of slugs and snails can be defined in various ways.\nThe living gastropod species that has the largest (longest) shell is *Syrinx aruanus* with a maximum shell length of 0.91\u00a0m (3.0\u00a0ft), a weight of 18\u00a0kg (40\u00a0lb) and a width of 96\u00a0cm (38\u00a0in).[216][217] Another giant species is *Melo amphora*, which in a 1974 specimen from Western Australia, measured 0.71\u00a0m (2.3\u00a0ft) long, had a maximum girth of 0.97\u00a0m (3.2\u00a0ft) and weighed 16\u00a0kg (35\u00a0lb).[1]\nThe largest shell-less gastropod is the giant black sea hare (*Aplysia vaccaria*) at 0.99\u00a0m (3.2\u00a0ft) in length and almost 14\u00a0kg (31\u00a0lb) in weight.\nThe largest of the land snails is the giant African snail (*Achatina achatina*) at up to 1\u00a0kg (2.2\u00a0lb) and 35\u00a0cm (14\u00a0in) long.\nCephalopods (Cephalopoda)\n(See Cephalopod size.) While generally much smaller than the giant *Architeuthis* and *Mesonychoteuthis*, the largest of the octopuses, the giant Pacific octopus (*Enteroctopus dofleini*), can grow to be very large. The largest confirmed weight of a giant octopus is 74\u00a0kg (163\u00a0lb),[218] with a 7\u00a0m (23\u00a0ft) arm span (with the tentacles fully extended) and a head-to-tentacle-tip length of 3.9\u00a0m (13\u00a0ft).[219] Specimens have been reported up to 125\u00a0kg (276\u00a0lb) but are unverified. A weight of 10 - 50kg is a much more common size.[1]\n### Roundworms (Nematoda)[edit]\n\n\nThe largest roundworm, *Placentonema gigantissima*,[220] is a parasite found in the placentas of sperm whales which can reach up to 9\u00a0m (30\u00a0ft) in length.[221]\n\n\n\n### Velvet worms (Onychophora)[edit]\n\n\nThe largest velvet worm known is Sol\u00f3rzano's velvet worm (*Peripatus solorzanoi*). An adult female was recorded to have a body length of 22\u00a0cm (approximately 8.7 in).[222]\n\n\n\n### Arthropods (Arthropoda)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Japanese spider crab.\nThe largest arthropod known to have existed is the eurypterid (sea scorpion) *Jaekelopterus*, reaching up to 2.5\u00a0m (8.2\u00a0ft) in body length, followed by the millipede relative *Arthropleura* at around 2.1\u00a0m (6.9\u00a0ft) in length.[223] Among living arthropods, the Japanese spider crab (*Macrocheira kaempferi*) is the largest in overall size, the record specimen, caught in 1921, had an extended arm span of 3.8\u00a0m (12\u00a0ft) and weighed about 19\u00a0kg (42\u00a0lb).[1] The heaviest is the American lobster (*Homarus americanus*), the largest verified specimen, caught in 1977 off of Nova Scotia weighed 20\u00a0kg (44\u00a0lb) and its body length was 1.1\u00a0m (3.6\u00a0ft).[1] The largest land arthropod and the largest land invertebrate is the coconut crab (*Birgus latro*), up to 40\u00a0cm (1.3\u00a0ft) long and weighing up to 4\u00a0kg (8.8\u00a0lb) on average. Its legs may span 1\u00a0m (3.3\u00a0ft).[1]\n\n\n\n#### Arachnids (Arachnida)[edit]\n\n\nBoth spiders and scorpions include contenders for the largest arachnids.\n\n\n\n![](image)Giant huntsman spider\nSpiders (Araneae)\nThe largest species of arachnid by length is probably the giant huntsman spider (*Heteropoda maxima*) of Laos, which in 2008 replaced the Goliath birdeater (*Theraphosa blondi*) of northern South America as the largest known spider by leg-span.[224] However the most massive arachnids, of comparable dimensions and possibly even greater mass, are the Chaco golden knee (*Grammostola pulchripes*), and the Brazilian salmon pink (*Lasiodora parahybana*). The huntsman spider may span up to 29\u00a0cm (11\u00a0in) across the legs, while in the New World tarantulas like *Theraphosa* can range up to 26\u00a0cm (10\u00a0in).[1] In *Grammostola*, *Theraphosa* and *Lasiodora*, the weight is projected to be up to at least 150\u00a0g (5.3\u00a0oz) and body length is up to 10\u00a0cm (3.9\u00a0in).[225]\nScorpions (Scorpiones)\nThe largest of the scorpions is the species *Heterometrus swammerdami* of the Indian subcontinent, which have a maximum length of 29.2\u00a0cm (11.5\u00a0in) and weigh around 60\u00a0g (2.1\u00a0oz). Another extremely large scorpion is the African emperor scorpion (*Pandinus imperator*), which can weigh 57\u00a0g (2.0\u00a0oz) but is not known to exceed a length of 23\u00a0cm (9.1\u00a0in).[1] However, they were dwarfed by *Pulmonoscorpius kirktonensis*, a giant extinct species of scorpion from Scotland, at an estimated length of 0.7\u00a0m (2.3\u00a0ft),[226] and the aquatic *Brontoscorpio*, at up to 94\u00a0cm (3.08\u00a0ft) which is only known from a free finger.[227]\nPseudoscorpions (Pseudoscorpiones)\nThe largest pseudoscorpion is *Garypus titanius*, from Ascension island, which can be 12\u00a0mm (0.47\u00a0in) long.[228]\n#### Crustaceans (Crustacea)[edit]\n\n\nThe largest crustacean is the Tasmanian giant crab (*Pseudocarcinus gigas*), with a weight of 13 kilograms (29\u00a0lb) and a carapace width of up to 46 centimetres (18\u00a0in). It is the only species in the genus ***Pseudocarcinus***.[229] Males reach more than twice the size of females.[230] At a length of up to 40 centimetres (16\u00a0in), *Lysiosquillina maculata* is the largest mantis shrimp in the world.[231] Tasmanian giant freshwater crayfish (*Astacopsis gouldi*) 5 kilograms (11\u00a0lb) in weight and over 80 centimetres (31\u00a0in) long have been known in the past, but now, even individuals over 2 kilograms (4.4\u00a0lb) are rare.[232] The species is only found in Tasmanian rivers flowing north into the Bass Strait below 400 metres (1,300\u00a0ft) above sea level, and is listed as an endangered species on the IUCN Red List.[233]\n\n\n\nBranchiopods (Branchiopoda)\nThe largest of these primarily freshwater crustaceans is probably *Branchinecta gigas*, which can reach a length 10\u00a0cm (3.9\u00a0in).[234]\nBarnacles and allies (Maxillopoda)\nThe largest species is *Pennella balaenopterae*, a copepod and ectoparasite specialising in parasitising marine mammals. The maximum size attained is 32\u00a0cm (about 13\u00a0in).[235] The largest of the barnacles is the giant acorn barnacle, *Balanus nubilis*, reaching 7\u00a0cm (2.8\u00a0in) in diameter and 12.7\u00a0cm (5.0\u00a0in) high.[236]\nOstracods (Ostracoda)\nThe largest living representative of these small and little-known but numerous crustaceans is the species *Gigantocypris australis* females of which reaching a maximum length of 3\u00a0cm (1.2\u00a0in).\nAmphipods, isopods, and allies (Peracarida)![](image)Giant isopod\nThe largest species is the giant isopod (*Bathynomus pergiganteus*), which can reach a length of 45\u00a0cm (18\u00a0inches) and a weight of 1.7\u00a0kg (3.7\u00a0lb).[237]\nRemipedes (Remipedia)\nThe largest of these cave-dwelling crustaceans is the species *Godzillius robustus*, at up to 4.5\u00a0cm (1.8\u00a0in).[238]\n#### Horseshoe crabs (Xiphosura)[edit]\n\n\nThe four modern horseshoe crabs are of roughly the same sizes, with females measuring up to 60\u00a0cm (2.0\u00a0ft) in length and 5\u00a0kg (11\u00a0lb) in weight.[239]\n\n\n\n#### Sea spiders (Pycnogonida)[edit]\n\n\nThe largest of the sea spiders is the deep-sea species *Colossendeis colossea*, attaining a leg span of nearly 60\u00a0cm (2.0\u00a0ft).[240]\n\n\n\n#### Trilobites (Trilobita)[edit]\n\n\nSome of these extinct marine arthropods exceeded 60\u00a0cm (24\u00a0in) in length. A nearly complete specimen of *Isotelus rex* from Manitoba attained a length over 70\u00a0cm (28\u00a0in), and an *Ogyginus forteyi* from Portugal was almost as long. Fragments of trilobites suggest even larger record sizes. An isolated pygidium of *Hungioides bohemicus* implies that the full animal was 90\u00a0cm (35\u00a0in) long.[241][242]\n\n\n\n#### Myriapods (Myriapoda)[edit]\n\n\nCentipedes (Chilopoda)\n![](image)*Scolopendra gigantea*\nThe biggest of the centipedes is *Scolopendra gigantea* of the neotropics, reaching a length of 33\u00a0cm (13\u00a0in).[243]\nMillipedes (Diplopoda)\nTwo species of millipede both reach a very large size: *Archispirostreptus gigas* of East Africa and *Scaphistostreptus seychellarum*, endemic to the Seychelles islands. Both of these species can slightly exceed a length of 28\u00a0cm (11\u00a0in) and measure over 2\u00a0cm (0.79\u00a0in) in diameter.[1] The largest ever known was the *Arthropleura*, a gigantic prehistoric specimen that reached nearly 189\u00a0cm (74\u00a0in).\nSymphylans (Symphyla)\nThe largest known symphylan is *Hanseniella magna*, originating in Tasmanian caves, which can reach lengths from 25\u00a0mm (0.98\u00a0in) up to 30\u00a0mm (1.2\u00a0in).[244]\n#### Insects (Insecta)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Goliath beetle\nInsects, a class of Arthropoda, are easily the most numerous class of organisms, with over one million identified species, and probably many undescribed species. The heaviest insect is almost certainly a species of beetle, which incidentally is the most species-rich order of organisms. Although heavyweight giant wetas (*Deinacrida heteracantha*) are known, the elephant beetles of Central and South America, (*Megasoma elephas*) and (*M. actaeon*), the Titan beetle (*Titanus giganteus*) of the neotropical rainforest or the Goliath beetles, (*Goliathus goliatus*) and (*G. regius*), of Africa's rainforest are thought to reach a higher weight.[245] The most frequently crowned are the Goliath beetles, the top known size of which is at least 100\u00a0g (3.5\u00a0oz) and 11.5\u00a0cm (4.5\u00a0in).[1] The elephant beetles and titan beetle can reach greater lengths than the Goliath, at up to 13.1 and 15.2\u00a0cm (5.2 and 6.0\u00a0in), respectively, but this is in part thanks to their rather large horns. The Goliath beetle's wingspan can range up to 25\u00a0cm (9.8\u00a0in).[1]\n\n\nSome moths and butterflies have much larger areas than the heaviest beetles, but weigh a fraction as much.\n\n\nThe longest insects are the stick insects, see below.\n\n\nRepresentatives of the extinct dragonfly-like order Meganisoptera, such as the Carboniferous *Meganeura monyi* of what is now France and the Permian *Meganeuropsis permiana* of what is now North America, are the largest insect species known to have existed. These creatures had a wingspan of some 75\u00a0cm (30\u00a0in) and a mass of over 1 pound (450\u00a0g), making them about the size of a crow.[1]\n\n\n\nCockroaches and termites (Blattodea)\n![](image)Giant burrowing cockroach\nThe largest cockroach by body mass is the Australian giant burrowing cockroach (*Macropanesthia rhinoceros*), also known as the rhinoceros cockroach. This species can attain a length of 8.3\u00a0cm (3.3\u00a0in) and a weight of 36\u00a0g (1.3\u00a0oz). It does not have wings.[246] The Brazilian giant cockroach (*Blaberus giganteus*) of the neotropics reaches greater sizes of up to 10 cm in length and 15 cm in wingspan, although it is not as massive and heavy as the burrowing species. The termites, traditionally classified in their own order (Isoptera), have recently been re-considered to belong in Blattodea. The largest of the termites is the African species *Macrotermes bellicosus*. The queen of this species can attain a length of 14\u00a0cm (5.5\u00a0in) and breadth of 5.5\u00a0cm (2.2\u00a0in) across the abdomen; other adults, on the other hand, are about a third of the size.[1]\nBeetles (Coleoptera)\nThe beetles are the largest order of organisms on earth, with about 400,000 species so far identified. The most massive species are the *Goliathus*, *Megasoma* and *Titanus* beetles already mentioned. Another fairly large species is the Hercules beetle (*Dynastes hercules*) of the neotropic rainforest with a maximum overall length of at least 19\u00a0cm (7.5\u00a0in) including the extremely long pronotal horn. The weight in this species does not exceed 16.5\u00a0g (0.58\u00a0oz).[1] The longest overall beetle is a species of longhorn beetle, *Batocera wallacei*, from New Guinea, which can attain a length of 26.6\u00a0cm (10.5\u00a0in), about 19\u00a0cm (7.5\u00a0in) of which is comprised by the long antennae.[1]\nEarwigs (Dermaptera)\nSince 1798, the largest of the earwigs has been the Saint Helena giant earwig (*Labidura herculeana*), endemic to the island of its name, measuring up to 8\u00a0cm (3.1\u00a0in) in length.[247] As of 2014, with the declaring of the organism extinct by the IUCN,[248] this may no longer be the case, although some believe a small number individuals are still extant.[249]\nTrue flies (Diptera)\n![](image)*Gauromydas heros*, the largest fly\nThe largest species of this order, which includes the common housefly, is the neotropical species *Gauromydas heros*, which can reach a length of 6\u00a0cm (2+3\u20448\u00a0in) and a wingspan of 10\u00a0cm (3.9\u00a0in).[1] Species of crane fly, the largest of which is *Holorusia brobdignagius*, can attain a length of 23\u00a0cm (9.1\u00a0in) but are extremely slender and much lighter in weight than *Gauromydas*.\nMayflies (Ephemeroptera)\nThe largest mayflies are members of the genus *Proboscidoplocia* from Madagascar. These insects can reach a length of 7\u00a0cm (2.8\u00a0in).[250]\nTrue bugs (Hemiptera)\n![](image)Giant water bug walking over land\nThe largest species of this diverse order is usually listed as the giant water bug in the genus *Lethocerus*, with *L. maximus* from the Neotropics being the absolutely largest.[251] They can surpass 12\u00a0cm (4.7\u00a0in) in length,[252] with some suggesting that the maximum size is 15\u00a0cm (5.9\u00a0in).[253] It is more slender and less heavy than most other insects of this size (principally the huge beetles). The largest cicada is *Megapomponia imperatoria*, which has a head-body length of about 7\u00a0cm (2.8\u00a0in) and a wingspan of 18\u201320\u00a0cm (7\u20138\u00a0in).[254][255] The cicadas of the genus *Tacua* can also grow to comparably large sizes. The largest type of aphid is the giant oak aphid (*Stomaphis quercus*), which can reach an overall length of 2\u00a0cm (0.79\u00a0in).[256] The biggest species of leafhopper is *Ledromorpha planirostris*, which can reach a length of 2.8\u00a0cm (1.1\u00a0in).[257]![](image)*Megachile pluto*, the largest bee.\nAnts and allies (Hymenoptera)\nThe largest of the ants, and the heaviest species of the order, are the females of the African *Dorylus helvolus*, reaching a length of 5.1\u00a0cm (2.0\u00a0in) and a weight of 8.5\u00a0g (0.30\u00a0oz).[1] The ant that averages the largest for the mean size within the whole colony is a ponerine ant, *Dinoponera gigantea*, from South America, averaging up to 3.3\u00a0cm (1.3\u00a0in) from the mandibles to the end of abdomen.[1] Workers of the bulldog ant (*Myrmecia brevinoda*) of Australia are up to 3.7\u00a0cm (1.5\u00a0in) in total length, although much of this is from their extremely large mandibles.[1] The largest of the bee species, also in the order Hymenoptera, is *Megachile pluto* of Indonesia, the females of which can be 3.8\u00a0cm (1.5\u00a0in) long, with a 6.3\u00a0cm (2.5\u00a0in) wingspan. Nearly as large, the carpenter bees can range up to 2.53\u00a0cm (1.00\u00a0in).[1] The largest wasp is probably the so-called tarantula hawk species *Pepsis pulszkyi* of South America, at up to 6.8\u00a0cm (2.7\u00a0in) long and 11.6\u00a0cm (4.6\u00a0in) wingspan, although many other *Pepsis* approach a similar size. The giant scarab-hunting wasp *Megascolia procer* may rival the largest tarantula hawks in weight and wingspan, though its body is not as long.[1]\nMoths and allies (Lepidoptera)![](image)Queen Alexandra's birdwing.\nThe Hercules moth (*Coscinocera hercules*), in the family Saturniidae, is endemic to New Guinea and northern Australia, and its wings have the largest documented surface area (300 square centimeters) of any living insect,[258][259] and a maximum wingspan which is confirmed to 28\u00a0cm (11\u00a0in) while unconfirmed specimens have spanned up to 35.5\u00a0cm (14.0\u00a0in). The largest species overall is often claimed to be either the Queen Alexandra's birdwing (*Ornithoptera alexandrae*), a butterfly from Papua New Guinea, or the Atlas moth (*Attacus atlas*), a moth from Southeast Asia. Both of these species can reach a length of 8\u00a0cm (3.1\u00a0in), a wingspan of 28\u00a0cm (11\u00a0in) and a weight of 12\u00a0g (0.42\u00a0oz). One Atlas moth allegedly had a wingspan of 30\u00a0cm (12\u00a0in) but this measurement was not verified.[1] The larvae in the previous species can weigh up to 58 and 54\u00a0g (2.0 and 1.9\u00a0oz), respectively. However, there are no reported measurements of surface area that would exceed the Hercules moth, and the white witch (*Thysania agrippina*) of Central and South America, has the largest recorded wingspan of the order, and indeed of any living insect, though the white witch is exceeded in surface area by the Hercules moth. The verified record-sized *Thysania* spanned 30.8\u00a0cm (12.1\u00a0in) across the wings, although specimens have been reported to 36\u00a0cm (14\u00a0in).[1] The heaviest mature moths have been cited in the giant carpenter moth (*Xyleutes boisduvali*) of Australia, which has weighed up to 20\u00a0g (0.71\u00a0oz) although the species does not surpass 25.5\u00a0cm (10.0\u00a0in) in wingspan.[1]\nMantises (Mantodea)\nThe largest species of this order is *Toxodera denticulata* from Java, which has been measured up to 20\u00a0cm (7.9\u00a0in) in overall length.[260] However, an undescribed species from the Cameroon jungle is allegedly much larger than any other mantis and may rival the larger stick insects for the longest living insect.[261] Among widespread mantis species, the largest is the Chinese mantis (*Tenodera aridifolia*). The females of this species can attain a length of up to 10.6\u00a0cm (4.2\u00a0in).\nScorpionflies (Mecoptera)\nThe largest scorpionfly, the common scorpionfly (*Panorpa communis*), can reach a body length of about 30 millimetres (1.2\u00a0in).[262]\nAlderflies and allies (Megaloptera)\nThis relatively small insect order includes some rather large species, many of which are noticeable for their elongated, imposing mandibles. The dobsonflies reach the greatest sizes of the order and can range up to 12.5\u00a0cm (4.9\u00a0in) in length.[263]\nNet-winged insects (Neuroptera)\n![](image)Blue eyes lacewing\nThese flying insects reach their largest size in *Palparellus voeltzkowi*, which can have a wingspan over 16\u00a0cm (6.3\u00a0in).[264] The largest lacewing is the \"blue eyes lacewing\" (*Nymphes myrmeleonides*) of Australia, which can measure up to 4\u00a0cm (1.6\u00a0in) in length and span 11\u00a0cm (4.3\u00a0in) across the wings.[265] Some forms of this ancient order could grow extremely large during the Jurassic period and may have ranked among the largest insects ever.[266] Found in the Early Cretaceous sedimentary rocks, *Makarkinia adamsi* had wings nearly 140\u2013160\u00a0mm (5.5\u20136.3\u00a0in) in length.[267]\nDragonflies (Odonata)\nThe largest species of dragonfly is *Megaloprepus caerulatus* of the neotropics, attaining a size of as much as 19\u00a0cm (7.5\u00a0in) across the wings and a body length of over 12\u00a0cm (4.7\u00a0in).[1] Spanning up to 17.6\u00a0cm (6.9\u00a0in) and measuring up to 11.8\u00a0cm (4.6\u00a0in) long, *Tetracanthagyna plagiata* of Southeast Asia is bulkier and heavier than *Megaloprepus* at up to 7\u00a0g (0.25\u00a0oz).[1]\nGrasshoppers and allies (Orthoptera)\n![](image)Giant weta\nThe largest of this widespread, varied complex of insects are the giant wetas of New Zealand, which is now split among 12 species. The largest of these is the Little Barrier Island giant weta (*Deinacrida heteracantha*), the largest specimen was weighed at 71.3\u00a0g (2.52\u00a0oz), one of the largest insects weights ever known. These heavyweight insects can be over 9\u00a0cm (3.5\u00a0in) long.[1] The largest grasshopper species is often considered to be the Australian giant grasshopper (*Valanga irregularis*), which ranges up to 9\u00a0cm (3.5\u00a0in) in length.[268] The American eastern lubber grasshopper (*Romalea guttata*) can allegedly range up to 10\u00a0cm (3.9\u00a0in) in length.[269] However, the greatest grasshopper sizes known, to 12\u00a0cm (4.7\u00a0in), have been cited in the South American giant grasshopper (*Tropidacris violaceus*). The longest members of this order (although much lighter than the giant wetas) is the katydid *Macrolyristes corporalis* of Southeast Asia which can range up to 21.5\u00a0cm (8.5\u00a0in) with its long legs extended and can have a wingspan of 20\u00a0cm (7.9\u00a0in).[270]\nStick insects (Phasmatodea)\nThe longest known stick insects are also the longest known insects, notably species in the tribe Pharnaciini, but they are generally relatively lightweight because of their slender shape. The longest is an unnamed species of *Phryganistria* discovered in China in 2016, where a specimen held at the Insect Museum of West China in Chengdu has a total length of 62.4\u00a0cm (24.6\u00a0in).[271] The second-longest species is the Australian *Ctenomorpha gargantua*, females of which have been measured at over 60\u00a0cm (24\u00a0in) in total length.[272] Other very large species, formerly believed to be longest but now considered third longest is *Sadyattes chani*; a specimen held in the Natural History Museum in London has a total length of 56.7\u00a0cm (22.3\u00a0in).[273][274] These measurements are, however, with the front legs fully extended; it has a body length measuring 35.7\u00a0cm (14.1\u00a0in).[275] Another very large species is *Phobaeticus kirbyi* where the total length (including extended legs) is up to 54.6\u00a0cm (21.5\u00a0in) and the body alone up to 32.8\u00a0cm (12.9\u00a0in).[276] Another of the longest insect in terms of total length is *Phobaeticus serratipes* of Malaysia and Singapore, measuring up to 55.5\u00a0cm (21.9\u00a0in).[277] Another extremely long stick insect is *Pharnacia maxima*, which measured 51\u00a0cm (20\u00a0in) with its legs extended.[1] The spiny stick insect (*Heteropteryx dilatata*) of Malaysia does not reach the extreme lengths of its cousins, the body reaching up to 16\u00a0cm (6.3\u00a0in) long, but it is much bulkier. The largest *Heteropteryx* weighed about 65\u00a0g (2.3\u00a0oz) and was 3.5\u00a0cm (1.4\u00a0in) wide across the thickest part of the body.[1]\nLice (Phthiraptera)\nThese insects, which live parasitically on other animals, are as a rule quite small. The largest known species is the hog louse, *Haematopinus suis*, a sucking louse that lives on large livestock like pigs and cattle. It can range up to 6\u00a0mm (0.24\u00a0in) in length.[278]\nStoneflies (Plecoptera)![](image)*Pteronarcys californica*\nThe largest species of stonefly is *Pteronarcys californica* of western North America, a species favored by fishermen as lures. This species can attain a length of 5\u00a0cm (2.0\u00a0in) and a wingspan of over 9.5\u00a0cm (3.7\u00a0in).[279]\nBooklice (Psocoptera)\nThe largest of this order of very small insects are the barklice of the genus *Psocus*, the top size of which is about 1 cm.[280]\nFleas (Siphonaptera)\nThe largest species of flea is *Hystrichopsylla schefferi*. This parasite is known exclusively from the fur of the mountain beaver (*Aplodontia rufa*) and can reach a length of 1.2\u00a0cm (0.47\u00a0in).[1]\nSilverfishes and allies (Thysanura)\nThese strange-looking insects, known to feed on human household objects, can range up to 4.3\u00a0cm (1.7\u00a0in) in length. A 350 million year old form was known to grow quite large, at up to 6\u00a0cm (2.4\u00a0in).[*citation needed*]\nThrips (Thysanoptera)\nMembers of the genus *Phasmothrips* are the largest kinds of thrips. The maximum size these species attain is approximately 1.3\u00a0cm (0.51\u00a0in) in length.[281]\nCaddisflies (Trichoptera)\nThe largest of the small, moth-like caddisflies is *Eubasilissa maclachlani*. This species can range up to 7\u00a0cm (2.8\u00a0in) across the wings.[282]\nAngel insects (Zoraptera)\nThe largest angel insect species, Hubbard's angel insect (*Zorotypus hubbardi*), grows up to 3\u00a0mm (0.12\u00a0in) in length.[283][284]\n### Cnidarians (Cnidaria)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The lion's mane jellyfish, one of the longest extant animals\nThe lion's mane jellyfish (*Cyanea capillata*) is the largest cnidarian species, of the class Scyphozoa. The largest known specimen of this giant, found washed up on the shore of Massachusetts Bay in 1870,[285][286] had a bell diameter of 2.5\u00a0m (8.2\u00a0ft), a weight of 150\u00a0kg (330\u00a0lb). The tentacles of this specimens were as long as 37\u00a0m (121\u00a0ft) and were projected to have a tentacular spread of about 75\u00a0m (246\u00a0ft) making it one of the longest extant animals.[1]\n\n\n\nCorals and sea anemones (Anthozoa)\nThe largest individual species are the sea-anemones of the genus *Discoma*, which can attain a mouth disc diameter of 60\u00a0cm (2.0\u00a0ft).[287] Longer, but much less massive overall, are the anemones of the genus *Ceriantharia*, at up to 2\u00a0m (6.6\u00a0ft) tall.[288] Communities of coral can be truly massive, a single colony of the genus *Porites* can be over 10\u00a0m (33\u00a0ft), but the actual individual organisms are quite small.\nHydrozoans (Hydrozoa)\nThe colonial siphonophore *Praya dubia* can attain lengths of 40\u201350\u00a0m (130\u2013160\u00a0ft).[289] The Portuguese man o' war's (*Physalia physalis*) tentacles can attain a length of up to 50\u00a0m (160\u00a0ft).[290] On 6 April 2020 the Schmidt Ocean Institute announced the discovery of a giant *Apolemia* siphonophore in submarine canyons near Ningaloo Coast, measuring 15\u00a0m (49\u00a0ft) diameter with a ring approximately 47\u00a0m (154\u00a0ft) long, claiming it was possibly the largest siphonophore ever recorded.[291][292]\n### Sponges (Porifera)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Despite its inert appearance, the heavyweight *Xestospongia muta* is indeed an animal\nThe largest known species of sea sponge is the giant barrel sponge, *Xestospongia muta*. These massively built sponges can reach 2.4\u00a0m (8\u00a0ft) in height and can be about the same thickness at the thickest part of the \"body\".[293] Some of these creatures have been estimated to be over 2,400 years of age.[294]\n\n\n\nCalcareous sponges (Calcarea)\nThe largest known of these small, inconspicuous sponges is probably the species *Pericharax heteroraphis*, attaining a height of 30\u00a0cm (0.98\u00a0ft).

Reaching a maximum confirmed length of 29.9 meters (98\u00a0ft) and weighing up to 199 tonnes (196 long tons; 219 short tons), it is the largest animal known ever to have existed.[a] The blue whale's long and slender body can be of various shades of greyish-blue dorsally and somewhat lighter underneath. Four subspecies are recognized: *B. m. musculus* in the North Atlantic and North Pacific, *B. m. intermedia* in the Southern Ocean, *B. m. brevicauda* (the pygmy blue whale) in the Indian Ocean and South Pacific Ocean, *B. m. indica* in the Northern Indian Ocean. There is also a population in the waters off Chile that may constitute a fifth subspecies.\n\n\nIn general, blue whale populations migrate between their summer feeding areas near the poles and their winter breeding grounds near the tropics. There is also evidence of year-round residencies, and partial or age/sex-based migration. Blue whales are filter feeders; their diet consists almost exclusively of krill. They are generally solitary or gather in small groups, and have no well-defined social structure other than mother-calf bonds. The fundamental frequency for blue whale vocalizations ranges from 8 to 25\u00a0Hz and the production of vocalizations may vary by region, season, behavior, and time of day. Orcas are their only natural predators.\n\n\nThe blue whale was once abundant in nearly all the Earth's oceans until the end of the 19th\u00a0century. It was hunted almost to the point of extinction by whalers until the International Whaling Commission banned all blue whale hunting in 1966. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed blue whales as Endangered as of 2018. It continues to face numerous man-made threats such as ship strikes, pollution, ocean noise, and climate change.\n\n\n\n\n## Taxonomy[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Evolution of cetaceans\n\n### Nomenclature[edit]\n\n\nThe genus name, *Balaenoptera*, means *winged whale*[5] while the species name, *musculus*, could mean \"muscle\" or a diminutive form of \"mouse,\" possibly a pun by Carl Linnaeus[6][5] when he named the species in *Systema Naturae*.[7] One of the first published descriptions of a blue whale comes from Robert Sibbald's *Phalainologia Nova*,[8] after Sibbald found a stranded whale in the estuary of the Firth of Forth, Scotland, in 1692. The name \"blue whale\" was derived from the Norwegian *bl\u00e5hval*, coined by Svend Foyn shortly after he had perfected the harpoon gun. The Norwegian scientist G. O. Sars adopted it as the common name in 1874.[9]\n\n\nBlue whales were referred to as \"Sibbald's rorqual,\" after Robert Sibbald, who first described the species.[8] Herman Melville called the blue whale \"sulphur bottom\" in his novel *Moby Dick*[10] because of the accumulation of diatoms creating a yellowish appearance on their pale underside.[6][11]\n\n\n\n### Evolution[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Balaenopteridae | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Minke whale\n |\n|  |\n|  | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | ***B. musculus*** (**blue whale**)\n |\n|  |\n|  | *B. borealis* (sei whale)\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n|  | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | *Eschrichtius robustus* (gray whale)\n |\n|  |\n|  | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | *B. physalus* (fin whale)\n |\n|  |\n|  | *Megaptera novaeangliae* (humpback whale)\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n| A phylogenetic tree of six baleen whale species[12] |\n\n\nBlue whales are rorquals in the family Balaenopteridae. A 2018 analysis estimates that the Balaenopteridae family diverged from other families in between 10.48 and 4.98\u00a0million years ago during the late Miocene.[12] The earliest discovered anatomically modern blue whale is a partial skull fossil found in southern Italy, dating to the Early Pleistocene, roughly 1.5\u20131.25\u00a0million years ago.[13] The Australian pygmy blue whale diverged during the Last Glacial Maximum. Their more recent divergence has resulted in the subspecies having a relatively low genetic diversity,[14] and New Zealand blue whales have an even lower genetic diversity.[15]\n\n\nWhole genome sequencing suggests that blue whales are most closely related to sei whales with gray whales as a sister group. This study also found significant gene flow between minke whales and the ancestors of the blue and sei whale. Blue whales also displayed high genetic diversity.[12]\n\n\n\n#### Hybridization[edit]\n\n\nBlue whales are known to interbreed with fin whales. The earliest description of a possible hybrid between a blue and fin whale was a 20-meter (65\u00a0ft) anomalous female whale with the features of both the blue and the fin whales taken in the North Pacific.[16] A whale captured off northwestern Spain in 1984, was found to have been the product of a blue whale mother and a fin whale father.[17]\n\n\nTwo live blue-fin whale hybrids have since been documented in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, (Canada), and in the Azores, (Portugal).[18] DNA tests done in Iceland on a blue whale killed in July 2018 by the Icelandic whaling company Hvalur hf, found that the whale was the offspring of a male fin whale and female blue whale;[19] however, the results are pending independent testing and verification of the samples. Because the International Whaling Commission classified blue whales as a \"Protection Stock,\" trading their meat is illegal, and the kill is an infraction that must be reported.[20] Blue-fin hybrids have been detected from genetic analysis of whale meat samples taken from Japanese markets.[21] Blue-fin whale hybrids are capable of being fertile. Molecular tests on a 21-meter (70\u00a0ft) pregnant female whale caught off Iceland in 1986 found that it had a blue whale mother and a fin whale father, while its fetus was sired by a blue whale.[22]\n\n\nThere is reference to a humpback-blue whale hybrid in the South Pacific, attributed to marine biologist Michael Poole.[5][23]\n\n\n\n### Subspecies and stocks[edit]\n\n\nAt least four subspecies of blue whale are recognized, some of which are divided into population stocks or \"management units.\"[24][25] They have a worldwide distribution, but are mostly absent from the Arctic Ocean and the Mediterranean, Okhotsk, and Bering Sea.[24]\n\n\n\n![Aerial photograph of an adult blue whale showing its length](image)Aerial view of adult blue whale\n* Northern subspecies (*B. m. musculus*)\n\t+ North Atlantic population \u2013 This population is mainly documented from New England along eastern Canada to Greenland, particularly in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, during summer though some individuals may remain there all year. They also aggregate near Iceland and have increased their presence in the Norwegian Sea. They are reported to migrate south to the West Indies, the Azores and northwest Africa.[24]\n\t+ Eastern North Pacific population \u2013 Whales in this region mostly feed off California from summer to fall and then Oregon, Washington State, the Alaska Gyre and Aleutian Islands later in the fall. During winter and spring, blue whales migrate south to the waters of Mexico, mostly the Gulf of California, and the Costa Rica Dome, where they both feed and breed.[24]\n\t+ Central/Western Pacific population \u2013 This stock is documented around the Kamchatka Peninsula during the summer; some individuals may remain there year-round. They have been recorded wintering in Hawaiian waters, though some can be found in the Gulf of Alaska during fall and early winter.[24]\n* Northern Indian Ocean subspecies (*B. m. indica*) \u2013 This subspecies can be found year-round in the northwestern Indian Ocean, though some individuals have recorded travelling to the Crozet Islands during between summer and fall.[24]\n* Pygmy blue whale (*B. m. brevicauda*)\n\t+ Madagascar population \u2013 This population migrates between the Seychelles and Amirante Islands in the north and the Crozet Islands and Prince Edward Islands in the south were they feed, passing through the Mozambique Channel.[24]\n\t+ Australia/Indonesia population \u2013 Whales in this region appear to winter off Indonesia and migrate to their summer feeding grounds off the coast of Western Australia, with major concentrations at Perth Canyon and an area stretching from the Great Australian Bight and Bass Strait.[24]\n\t+ Eastern Australia/New Zealand population \u2013 This stock may reside in the Tasman Sea and the Lau Basin in winter and feed mostly in the South Taranaki Bight and off the coast of eastern North Island. Blue whales have been detected around New Zealand throughout the year.[24]\n* Antarctic subspecies (*B. m. intermedia*) \u2013 This subspecies includes all populations found around the Antarctic. They have been recorded to travel as far north as eastern tropical Pacific, the central Indian Ocean, and the waters of southwestern Australia and northern New Zealand.[24]\n\n\nBlue whales off the Chilean coast may be a separate subspecies based on geographic separation, genetics, and unique song types.[26][27][28] Chilean blue whales may overlap in the Eastern Tropical Pacific with Antarctica blue whales and Eastern North Pacific blue whales. Chilean blue whales are genetically differentiated from Antarctica blue whales and are unlikely to be interbreeding. However, the genetic distinction is less with the Eastern North Pacific blue whale and there may be gene flow between hemispheres.[29]\n\n\n\n## Description[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A blue whale with its bow wave, showing the blowhole\nThe blue whale is a slender-bodied cetacean with a broad U-shaped head; thin, elongated flippers; a small 33 centimeters (13\u00a0in) sickle-shaped dorsal fin located close to the tail and a large tail stock at the root of the wide and thin flukes. The upper jaw is lined with 70\u2013395 black baleen plates. The throat region has 60\u201388 grooves which allows the skin to expand during feeding.[5][6][11][30][31] It has two blowholes that can squirt 9.1\u201312.2 meters (30\u201340\u00a0ft) up in the air.[5][11][30] The skin has a mottled grayish-blue coloration, appearing blue underwater.[6][11][30] The mottling patterns near the dorsal fin vary between individuals.[32][33][34] The underbelly has lighter pigmentation and can appear yellowish due to diatoms in the water,[6][11][30] which historically earned them the nickname \"sulphur bottom.\"[10][35] The male blue whale has the largest penis in the animal kingdom, at around 3\u00a0m (9.8\u00a0ft) long and 12\u00a0in (30\u00a0cm) wide.[36]\n\n\n\n### Size[edit]\n\n\n![Photograph of a blue whale skull](image)A blue whale skull measuring 5.8 meters (19\u00a0ft)\nThe blue whale is the largest animal known ever to have existed.[37][38][39] Some studies have estimated that certain shastasaurid ichthyosaurs and the ancient whale *Perucetus* could have rivalled the blue whale in size, with *Perucetus* also being heavier than the blue whale with a mean weight of 180 tons; however, these estimates are based on fragmentary remains, as well as being subject to change as the latter was a very recently-described species.[40][3] Likewise, other studies estimate that on land, large sauropods like *Bruhathkayosaurus* (mean weight: 110\u2013170 tons) and *Maraapunisaurus* (mean weight: 80\u2013120 tons) would have easily rivalled the blue whale, with the former even exceeding the blue whale based on its most liberal estimations (240 tons); however, these estimates are based on even more fragmentary specimens that had disintegrated by the time those estimates were made.[4]\n\n\nThe International Whaling Commission (IWC) whaling database reports 88 individuals longer than 30 meters (98\u00a0ft), including one of 33 meters (108\u00a0ft), but problems with how the measurements were taken suggest that any longer than 30.5 meters (100\u00a0ft) are suspect.[41] The Discovery Committee reported lengths up to 31 meters (102\u00a0ft);[42] however, the longest scientifically measured individual blue whale was 30 meters (98\u00a0ft) from rostrum tip to tail notch.[43] Female blue whales are larger than males.[11][44] Hydrodynamic models suggest a blue whale could not exceed 108\u00a0ft (33\u00a0m) because of metabolic and energy constraints.[45]\n\n\nThe average length of sexually mature female blue whales is 22.0 meters (72.1\u00a0ft) for Eastern North Pacific blue whales, 24 meters (79\u00a0ft) for central and western North Pacific blue whales, 21\u201324 meters (68\u201378\u00a0ft) for North Atlantic blue whales, 25.4\u201326.3 meters (83.4\u201386.3\u00a0ft) for Antarctic blue whales, 23.5 meters (77.1\u00a0ft) for Chilean blue whales, and 21.3 meters (69.9\u00a0ft) for pygmy blue whales.[41][46][47]\n\n\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, males weigh an average 100 metric tons (220,000\u00a0lb) and females 112 metric tons (247,000\u00a0lb). Eastern North Pacific blue whale males average 88.5 tonnes (195,000\u00a0lb) and females 100 tonnes (220,000\u00a0lb). Antarctic males average 112 tonnes (247,000\u00a0lb) and females 130 tonnes (290,000\u00a0lb). Pygmy blue whale males average 83.5 tonnes (184,000\u00a0lb) to 99 tonnes (218,000\u00a0lb).[48] The weight measured of the heart from a stranded North Atlantic blue whale was 180\u00a0kg (400\u00a0lb), the largest known in any animal.[49]\n\n\nThe record-holder blue whale was recorded at 173 tonnes (190 short tons),[50] with estimates of up to 199 tonnes (220 short tons).[51]\n\n\n\n### Life span[edit]\n\n\nBlue whales live around 80\u201390 years or more.[11][52] Scientists look at a blue whale's earwax or ear plug to estimate its age. Each year, a light and dark layer of wax is laid corresponding with fasting during migration and feeding time. Each set is thus an indicator of age.[53][54][55] The oldest blue whale determined using this method was 110 years old.[52][56] The maximum age of a pygmy blue whale determined this way is 73 years.[57] In addition, female blue whales develop scars or corpora albicantia on their ovaries every time they ovulate.[58] In a female pygmy blue whale, one corpus albicans is formed on average every 2.6 years.[57]\n\n\n\n## Behaviour and ecology[edit]\n\n\n![Photograph of a whale blowing](image)The blow of a blue whale\nThe blue whale is usually solitary, but can be found in pairs. When productivity is high enough, blue whales can be seen in gatherings of more than 50 individuals.[11] Populations may go on long migrations, traveling to their summer feeding grounds towards the poles and then heading to their winter breeding grounds in more equatorial waters.[59] The animals appear to use memory to locate the best feeding areas.[60] There is evidence of alternative strategies, such as year-round residency, and partial (where only some individuals migrate) or age/sex-based migration. Some whales have been recorded feeding in breeding grounds.[61] The traveling speed for blue whales ranges 5\u201330 kilometers per hour (3.1\u201318.6\u00a0mph).[11] Their massive size limits their ability to breach.[62]\n\n\nThe greatest dive depth reported from tagged blue whales was 315 meters (1,033\u00a0ft).[63] Their theoretical aerobic dive limit was estimated at 31.2 minutes,[64] however, the longest dive measured was 15.2 minutes.[63] The deepest confirmed dive from a pygmy blue whale was 506 meters (1,660\u00a0ft).[65] A blue whale's heart rate can drop to 2 beats per minute (bpm) at deep depths, but upon surfacing, can rise to 37 bpm, which is close to its peak heart rate.[66]\n\n\n\n### Diet and feeding[edit]\n\n\n![Photograph of the blue whale's small dorsal fin](image)The small dorsal fin of this blue whale is just visible on the far left.\nThe blue whale's diet consists almost exclusively of krill.[11] Blue whales capture krill through lunge feeding, they swim towards them at high speeds as they open their mouths up to 80\u00b0[11][63] They may engulf 220 metric tons (220 long tons; 240 short tons) of water at one time.[67] They squeeze the water out through their baleen plates with pressure from the throat pouch and tongue, and swallow the remaining krill.[11][63] Blue whales have been recorded making 180\u00b0 rolls during lunge-feeding, possibly allowing them to search the prey field and find the densest patches.[68]\n\n\nWhile pursuing krill patches, blue whales maximize their calorie intake by increasing the number of lunges while selecting the thickest patches. This provides them enough energy for everyday activities while storing additional energy necessary for migration and reproduction. Blue whales have to engulf densities greater than 100 krill/m3 to maintain the cost of lunge feeding.[63][69] They can consume 34,776\u20131,912,680 kilojoules (8,312\u2013457,141\u00a0kcal) from one mouthful of krill, which can provide up to 240 times more energy than used in a single lunge.[63] It is estimated that an average-sized blue whale must consume 1,120\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0359 kilograms (2,469\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0791\u00a0lb) of krill a day.[70][71]\n\n\nBlue whales appear to avoid directly competing with other baleen whales.[72][73][74] Different whale species select different feeding spaces and times as well as different prey species.[67][75][76] In the Southern Ocean, baleen whales appear to feed on Antarctic krill of different sizes, which may lessen competition between them.[77]\n\n\n\n### Reproduction and birth[edit]\n\n\n![Photograph of a blue whale calf and its mother](image)A blue whale calf with its mother\nBlue whales generally reach sexual maturity at 8\u201310 years. In the Northern Hemisphere, the length at which they reach maturity is 21\u201323 meters (69\u201375\u00a0ft) for females and 20\u201321 meters (66\u201369\u00a0ft) for males. In the Southern Hemisphere, the length of maturity is 23\u201324 meters (75\u201379\u00a0ft) and 22 meters (72\u00a0ft) for females and males respectively.[78] Male pygmy blue whales average 18.7 meters (61.4\u00a0ft) at sexual maturity.[79][80] Female pygmy blue whales are 21.0\u201321.7 meters (68.9\u201371.2\u00a0ft) in length[46] and roughly 10 years old at the age of sexual maturity.[46][47][81] Little is known about mating behavior, or breeding and birthing areas.[39][78] Blue whales appear to be polygynous, with males competing for females.[78][82] A male blue whale typically trails a female and will fight off potential rivals.[83] The species mates from fall to winter.[39][78]\n\n\nPregnant females eat roughly four percent of their body weight daily,[84] amounting to 60% of their overall body weight throughout summer foraging periods.[78][85] Gestation may last 10\u201312 months with calves being 6\u20137 meters (20\u201323\u00a0ft) long and weighing 2\u20133 metric tons (2.0\u20133.0 long tons; 2.2\u20133.3 short tons) at birth.[78] Estimates suggest that because calves require 2\u20134 kilograms (4.4\u20138.8\u00a0lb) milk per kg of mass gain, blue whales likely produce 220 kilograms (490\u00a0lb) of milk per day (ranging from 110 to 320 kilograms (240 to 710\u00a0lb) of milk per day).[86] The first video of a calf thought to be nursing was filmed in New Zealand in 2016.[87] Calves may be weaned when they reach 6\u20138 months old at a length of 16 meters (53\u00a0ft).[78] They gain roughly 37,500 pounds (17,000\u00a0kg) during the weaning period.[38] Interbirth periods last two to three years;[78] they average 2.6 years in pygmy blue whales.[57]\n\n\n\n### Vocalizations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nA blue whale song\n\n\nRecorded in the Atlantic (1)\n\n\n---\n\nA blue whale song\n\n\nRecorded in the Atlantic (2)\n\n\n---\n\nA blue whale song\n\n\nRecorded in North Eastern Pacific\n\n\n---\n\nA blue whale song\n\n\nRecorded in the South Pacific\n\n\n---\n\nA blue whale song\n\n\nRecorded in the West Pacific\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing these files? See media help.*\n\nBlue whales produce some of the loudest and lowest frequency vocalizations in the animal kingdom,[24] and their inner ears appear well adapted for detecting low-frequency sounds.[88] The fundamental frequency for blue whale vocalizations ranges from 8 to 25\u00a0Hz.[89] Blue whale songs vary between populations.[90]\n\n\nVocalizations produced by the Eastern North Pacific population have been well studied. This population produces pulsed calls (\"A\") and tonal calls (\"B\"), upswept tones that precede type B calls (\"C\") and separate downswept tones (\"D\").[91][92] A and B calls are often produced in repeated co-occurring sequences and sung only by males, suggesting a reproductive function.[92][93] D calls may have multiple functions. They are produced by both sexes during social interactions while feeding.[93][94] and by males when competing for mates.[83]\n\n\nBlue whale calls recorded off Sri Lanka have a three\u2010unit phrase. The first unit is a 19.8 to 43.5\u00a0Hz pulsive call, and is normally 17.9 \u00b1 5.2 seconds long. The second unit is a 55.9 to 72.4\u00a0Hz FM upsweep that is 13.8 \u00b1 1.1 seconds long. The final unit is 28.5 \u00b1 1.6 seconds long with a tone of 108 to 104.7\u00a0Hz.[95] A blue whale call recorded off Madagascar, a two\u2010unit phrase,[96] consists of 5\u20137 pulses with a center frequency of 35.1 \u00b1 0.7\u00a0Hz lasting 4.4 \u00b1 0.5 seconds proceeding a 35 \u00b1 0\u00a0Hz tone that is 10.9 \u00b1 1.1 seconds long.[95] In the Southern Ocean, blue whales produce 18-second vocals which start with a 9-second-long, 27\u00a0Hz tone, and then a 1-second downsweep to 19\u00a0Hz, followed by a downsweep further to 18\u00a0Hz.[97][98] Other vocalizations include 1\u20134 second long, frequency-modulated calls with a frequency of 80 and 38\u00a0Hz.[98][99]\n\n\nThere is evidence that some blue whale songs have temporally declined in tonal frequency.[100][101][102] The vocalization of blue whales in the Eastern North Pacific decreased in tonal frequency by 31% from the early 1960s to the early 21st century.[100][101] The frequency of pygmy blue whales in the Antarctic has decreased by a few tenths of a hertz every year starting in 2002.[102] It is possible that as blue whale populations recover from whaling, there is increasing sexual selection pressure (i.e., a lower frequency indicates a larger body size).[101]\n\n\n\n### Predators and parasites[edit]\n\n\nThe only known natural predator to blue whales is the orca, although the rate of fatal attacks by orcas is unknown. Photograph-identification studies of blue whales have estimated that a high proportion of the individuals in the Gulf of California have rake-like scars, indicative of encounters with orcas.[103] Off southeastern Australia, 3.7% of blue whales photographed had rake marks and 42.1% of photographed pygmy blue whales off Western Australia had rake marks.[104] Documented predation by orcas has been rare. A blue whale mother and calf were first observed being chased at high speeds by orcas off southeastern Australia.[105] The first documented attack occurred in 1977 off southwestern Baja California, Mexico, but the injured whale escaped after five hours.[106] Four more blue whales were documented as being chased by a group of orcas between 1982 and 2003.[107] The first documented predation event by orcas occurred in September 2003, when a group of orcas in the Eastern Tropical Pacific was encountered feeding on a recently killed blue whale calf.[108] In March 2014, a commercial whale watch boat operator recorded an incident involving a group of orcas harassing a blue whale in Monterey Bay. The blue whale defended itself by slapping its tail.[109] A similar incident was recorded by a drone in Monterey Bay in May 2017.[110] The first direct observations of orca predation occurred off the south coast of Western Australia, two in 2019 and one more in 2021. The first victim was estimated to be 18\u201322 meters (59\u201372\u00a0ft).[111]\n\n\nIn Antarctic waters, blue whales accumulate diatoms of the species *Cocconeis ceticola* and the genera *Navicola*, which are normally removed when the whales enter warmer waters. Other external parasites include barnacles such as *Coronula diadema*, *Coronula reginae*, and *Cryptolepas rhachianecti*, which latch on their skin deep enough to leave behind a pit if removed. Whale lice species make their home in cracks of the skin and are relatively harmless. The copepod species *Pennella balaenopterae* digs in and attaches itself to the blubber to feed on. Intestinal parasites include the trematode genera *Ogmogaster* and *Lecithodesmus*; the tapeworm genera *Priapocephalus*, *Phyllobotrium*, *Tetrabothrius*, *Diphyllobotrium*, and *Diplogonoporus*; and the thorny-headed worm genus *Bolbosoma*. In the North Atlantic, blue whales also contain the protozoans *Entamoeba*, *Giardia* and *Balantidium*.[112]\n\n\n\n## Conservation[edit]\n\n\nThe global blue whale population is estimated to be 5,000\u201315,000 mature individuals and 10,000\u201325,000 total as of 2018. By comparison, there were at least 140,000 mature whales in 1926. There are an estimated total of 1,000\u20133,000 whales in the North Atlantic, 3,000\u20135,000 in the North Pacific, and 5,000\u20138,000 in the Antarctic. There are possibly 1,000\u20133,000 whales in the eastern South Pacific while the pygmy blue whale may number 2,000\u20135,000 individuals.[1] Blue whales have been protected in areas of the Southern Hemisphere since 1939. In 1955, they were given complete protection in the North Atlantic under the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling; this protection was extended to the Antarctic in 1965 and the North Pacific in 1966.[113][114] The protected status of North Atlantic blue whales was not recognized by Iceland until 1960.[115] In the U.S., the species is protected under the Endangered Species Act.[59]\n\n\nBlue whales are formally classified as endangered under both the U.S. Endangered Species Act[116] and the IUCN Red List.[1] They are also listed on Appendix\u00a0I under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES)[117] and the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals.[118] Although, for some populations, there is not enough information on current abundance trends (e.g., pygmy blue whales), others are critically endangered (e.g., Antarctic blue whales).[119][120]\n\n\n\n### Threats[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Dead blue whale on flensing platform\nBlue whales were initially difficult to hunt because of their size and speed.[24] This began to change in the mid-19th century with the development of harpoons that can be shot as projectiles.[121] Blue whale whaling peaked between 1930 and 1931 with 30,000 animals taken. Harvesting of the species was particularly high in the Antarctic, with 350,000\u2013360,000 whales taken in the first half of the 20th century. In addition, 11,000 North Atlantic whales (mostly around Iceland) and 9,500 North Pacific whales were killed during the same period.[78] The International Whaling Commission banned all hunting of blue whales in 1966 and gave them worldwide protection.[122] However, the Soviet Union continued to illegally hunt blue whales and other species up until the 1970s.[123]\n\n\n\n![](image)Researchers examine a dead blue whale killed by collision with a ship\nShip strikes are a significant mortality factor for blue whales, especially off the U.S. West Coast,[124] A total of 17 blue whales were killed or suspected to have been killed by ships between 1998 and 2019 off the US West Coast.[24] Five deaths in 2007 off California were considered an unusual mortality event, as defined under the Marine Mammal Protection Act.[124][125] Lethal ship strikes are also a problem in Sri Lankan waters, where their habitat intersects with one of the world's most active shipping routes.[126] Here, strikes caused the deaths of eleven blue whales in 2010 and 2012,[127] and at least two in 2014.[128] Ship strike mortality claimed the lives of two blue whales off southern Chile in the 2010s.[129][130] Possible measures for reducing future ship strikes include better predictive models of whale distribution, changes in shipping lanes, vessel speed reductions, and seasonal and dynamic management of shipping lanes.[131][132] Few cases of blue whale entanglement in commercial fishing gear have been documented. The first report in the U.S. occurred off California in 2015, reportedly some type of deep-water trap/pot fishery.[133] Three more entanglement cases were reported in 2016.[134] In Sri Lanka, a blue whale was documented with a net wrapped through its mouth, along the sides of its body, and wound around its tail.[135]\n\n\nIncreasing man-made underwater noise impacts blue whales.[136][137] They may be exposed to noise from commercial shipping[138][139] and seismic surveys as a part of oil and gas exploration.[140][141] Blue whales in the Southern California Bight decreased calling in the presence of mid-frequency active (MFA) sonar.[142] Exposure to simulated MFA sonar was found to interrupt blue whale deep-dive feeding but no changes in behavior were observed in individuals feeding at shallower depths. The responses also depended on the animal's behavioral state, its (horizontal) distance from the sound source and the availability of prey.[143]\n\n\nThe potential impacts of pollutants on blue whales is unknown. However, because blue whales feed low on the food chain, there is a lesser chance for bioaccumulation of organic chemical contaminants.[144] Analysis of the earwax of a male blue whale killed by a collision with a ship off the coast of California showed contaminants like pesticides, flame retardants, and mercury. Reconstructed persistent organic pollutant (POP) profiles suggested that a substantial maternal transfer occurred during gestation and/or lactation.[145] Male blue whales in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Canada, were found to have higher concentrations of PCBs, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), metabolites, and several other organochlorine compounds relative to females, reflecting maternal transfer of these persistent contaminants from females into young.[146]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Cetaceans portal\n* ![icon](image)Mammals portal\n* ![](image)Marine life portal\n\n\n* Largest organisms\n* List of cetaceans\n* List of largest mammals\n* List of whale vocalizations\n\n\n## Note[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The extinct whale species Perucetus collossus (described in 2023) may have rivalled or exceeded the blue whale in size, with an estimated mass of 80 to 340 tons, and its average estimate of 180 tons surpassing the average blue whale's mass of 100 to 130 tons (but not the largest individual blue whale ever found).[3] Several extinct dinosaurs may also have reached a similar mass to the blue whale.[4]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Reilly, S.

A western population that summers near the Commander Islands, the coast of Kamchatka, along the Kuril Islands and in the Sea of Okhotsk is thought to number in the low hundreds. Before commercial whaling in the North Pacific (i.e. pre-1835) there were probably over 20,000 right whales in the region. The taking of right whales in commercial whaling has been prohibited by one or more international treaties since 1935. Nevertheless, between 1962 and 1968, illegal Soviet whaling killed at least 529 right whales in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska as well as at least 132 right whales in the Sea of Okhotsk,[5] plus an additional 104 North Pacific right whales from unspecified areas.[6]\n\n\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature categorizes the species as \"Endangered\", and categorizes the Northeast Pacific population as \"Critically Endangered\".[7] The Center for Biological Diversity argues that the North Pacific right whale is the most endangered whale on Earth.[8]\n\n\n\n\n## Taxonomy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Eubalaena\n\nSince 2000, scientists have considered the right whales in the North Pacific and nearby seas to be a separate species, *Eubalaena japonica*, the North Pacific right whale. Genetic differences between *E. japonica* and *E. australis* are much smaller than other baleen whales represent among different ocean basins.[9]\n\n\nBefore 2000, right whales in the North Pacific were considered conspecific with right whales in the North Atlantic and Southern Hemisphere and all described as *Eubalaena glacialis* in the scientific literature. All these animals resemble each other in outward appearance very closely. The differences that separate them into separate species are genetic and discussed in the article on Balaenidae. The recognition of the different populations of *Eubalaena* whales as distinct species is supported by the Society for Marine Mammalogy,[10] the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service, and the International Whaling Commission.[11]\n\n\nThe North Pacific, North Atlantic and Southern right whales are all members of the family Balaenidae. The bowhead whale found in the Arctic is also a balaenid whale, but sufficiently different to warrant its own genus *Balaena*.\n\n\nThe cladogram is a tool for visualizing and comparing the evolutionary relationships between taxa. The point where a node branches off is analogous to an evolutionary branching \u2013 the diagram can be read left-to-right, much like a timeline. The following cladogram of the family Balaenidae serves to illustrate the current scientific consensus as to the relationships between the North Pacific right whale and the other members of its family.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Family Balaenidae[12] |\n| |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \u00a0Family\u00a0Balaenidae | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| *Eubalaena*\u00a0(right\u00a0whales)\u00a0\u00a0\n | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | \u00a0*E. glacialis* North Atlantic right whale\n |\n|  |\n|  | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | \u00a0*E. japonica* North Pacific right whale\n |\n|  |\n|  | \u00a0*E. australis* Southern right whale\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n| *Balaena*\u00a0(bowhead\u00a0whales)\u00a0\n | \u00a0*B. mysticetus* bowhead whale\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n\n\n\n## Description[edit]\n\n\n![](image)North Pacific right whale by John Durban, NOAA\n*E. japonica* is a very large, thickset baleen whale. It very closely resembles the North Atlantic right whale (*E. glacialis*) the southern right whale (*E. australis*), so much so they were long thought to be just one species. Indeed, without knowing which ocean an individual came from, the physical similarities are so extensive that individuals can only be identified to species by genetic analysis. Relative to the other right whale species, *E. japonica* may be slightly larger. Like other baleen whales, female North Pacific right whales are larger than males. Also, North Pacific brindle-colored individuals are less common than they are among southern right whales.\n\n\n*E. japonica* is easily distinguished from other North Pacific whale species by several fieldmarks: lack of dorsal fin or bump, very broad, black back, cyamid-covered callosities on the head and lips, a very arched jaw line, a very narrow rostrum, and often a V-shaped spout. North Pacific right whales can reach 15 to 18.3\u00a0m (49 to 60\u00a0ft) in length as adults, larger than the North Atlantic right whale.[13] Typical body mass is from 50,000\u201380,000\u00a0kg (110,000\u2013180,000\u00a0lb),[14] or to 100,000\u00a0kg (220,000\u00a0lb) which weighs twice as of typical humpback whales.[15] There is one record of a 19.8\u00a0m (65\u00a0ft) whale captured during illegal Soviet operations,[16] while reliability of larger measurements of 20.7\u00a0m (68\u00a0ft) with 135,000\u00a0kg (298,000\u00a0lb)[17] and 2 cases of 21.3\u00a0m (70\u00a0ft)[18][19] one each from eastern and western pacific sides are uncertain. They are much larger than gray or humpback whales and also being very stout, particularly when compared to the other large baleen whales such as blue and fin whales. For 10 North Pacific right whales taken in the 1960s, their girth in front of the flippers was 0.73 of the total length of the whale.[20] There have been claims that pectoral fins of pacific right whale are larger in portion than the other right whales and more pointed, and there may exist shape differences of tail by individuals or sex.[19] Additionally, differences of coloration and shape (minor) of baleen plates between pacific and Atlantic have been noted.\n\n\n\n![](image)North Pacific right whale, Half Moon Bay, California, March 20, 1982, photo by Jim Scarff\nRight whales are also unique in that they all have callosities\u2014roughened patches of epidermis covered with thousands of small light-colored cyamids. The callosities appear in patches on its head immediately behind the blowholes, along the rostrum to the tip, which often has a large callosity, referred to by whalers as the \"bonnet\".[20] The functional purpose of the callosities has not been determined.\n\n\nThe closely related bowhead whale differs from the right whale by lacking any callosities, having a more arched jaw and longer baleen. The seasonal ranges of the two species do not overlap. The bowhead whale is found at the edge of the pack ice in more Arctic waters in the Chukchi Sea and Beaufort Sea, and occurs in the Bering Sea only during winter. The bowhead whale is not found in the North Pacific.\n\n\nAlthough more than 15,000 right whales were killed by whalers in the North Pacific,[21] there are remarkably few detailed descriptions of these whales. Most of our information about the anatomy and morphology of *E. japonica* comes from 13 whales killed by Japanese whalers in the 1960s[22] and 10 whales killed by Russian whalers in the 1950s.[23] Basic information about right whale lengths and sex are also available from coastal whaling operations in the early part of the 20th century.[13]\n\n\n\n## Ecology and behavior[edit]\n\n\n### Feeding[edit]\n\n\nLike right whales in other oceans, North Pacific right whales feed primarily on copepods, mainly the species *Calanus marshallae*.[24] They also have been reported off Japan and in the Gulf of Alaska, feeding on copepods of the genus *Neocalanus* with a small quantity of euphausiid larvae, *Euphausia pacifica*.[11]\n\n\nLike other right whale species, the North Pacific right whale feeds by skimming water continuously while swimming; this is in contrast to balaenopterid whales, such as the blue and humpback whales, which engulf prey in rapid lunges, surging upward rapidly from the depths. Right whales do not have pleated throats. Instead, they have very large heads and mouths that allow them to swim with their mouths open (similar to the basking and whale sharks); the water with the copepods flows in, then flows sideways through the right whale's very long, very fine baleen trapping the copepods, and then out over their large lower lips. The mouth is then closed tightly to expel the excess water, with the prey being effectively trapped in the whale's mouth, behind the baleen.\n\n\nIt takes millions of the tiny copepods to provide the energy a right whale needs. Thus, right whales must find copepods at very high concentrations, greater than 3,000 per cubic meter to feed efficiently. National Marine Fisheries Service researchers mapped the southeast Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska for areas with sufficient productivity to support such concentrations, and analyzed the roles of bathymetry and various gyres in concentrating copepods to such densities.[24]\n\n\n\n### Behavior[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Cetacean surfacing behaviour\n\n![](image)Breaching right whale, Half Moon Bay, California, March 20, 1982, photo by Jim Scarff\nThere have been very few, short visual observations of right whale behavior in the North Pacific. The mid-19th century whaling onslaught occurred before there was much scientific interest in whale behavior, and included no scientific observation. By the time scientific interest in this species developed, very few whales remained and nowhere in the eastern North Pacific or Bering Sea could observers reliably find them. Based on limited observations in the 19th century, it was noted that the more extensively whaling was conducted, the more aggressive and harder to approach the whales became.[18] These traits correspond with some of recent observations in which whales seemed to be very sensitive to vessels and easily swim away with by submerging longer to avoid ships enough for onlookers and observers to lose sights.[25][26] Pre-World War I whaling logs from Japan also describe right whales as being among the most sensitive of targeted baleen or toothed species to the impacts of whaling, as they immediately fled from locations where whaling took place, possibly abandoning their habitat for good.[27]\n\n\nAs of 2006, scientists had minimal success satellite tagging North Pacific right whales.[28] Observations total probably less than 50 hours over the last 50 years. What little is known about North Pacific right whale behavior suggests that it is similar to the behavior of right whales in other oceans, except in its choice of wintering grounds. The individual which was observed during a whale-watching tour off the Kii Peninsula, Japan breached six times in a row in 2006.[29] The same whale watching operator had two sightings in 2006 and again had a very close encounter with a right whale in 2011. This animal was very curious and active; it swam around the vessel for more than 2 hours, breaching, spyhopping, tail-slapping, and pec-slapping close to the boat. The ship had to cruise away from the whale because it kept following them. Another curious and playful individual was encountered during a whale-watching trip off Bonin Islands in March 2014.[30]\n\n\nLike the other *Eubalaena* species, North Pacific right whales are known to interact with other cetacean species. Several observations of North Pacific right whales to interact with groups or solitary humpback whales have been recorded in both Eastern and Western North Pacific. A record of a pair of gray whales were seen showing signs of aggression towards a right whale and chasing it off California, 1998,[31] while a sub-adult right whale was seen swimming in a group of critically endangered Western gray whales with social behaviors demonstrated in inshore water (Piltun Bay region) of Sakhalin's northeast coast in 2012.[32][33]\n\n\n\n#### Vocalizations[edit]\n\n\nRight whales in the Southern Hemisphere and the North Atlantic make a variety of vocalizations that have been researched extensively in the last decade. Because the numbers of right whales in the North Pacific are so small, and the whales are located in more remote areas, the study of North Pacific right whale vocalizations has had more challenges and there are fewer recordings. All of the sounds recorded for North Pacific right whales have been recorded on the northern portion of their range\u2014in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska. It is unknown whether they made additional or different vocalization on their wintering grounds or on the western part of their range. From these relatively few samples it appears that right whales in the North Pacific make calls similar to those of other right whale species (*Eubalaena* spp.), although the calls may differ in some details and in the relatively frequency of usage of different calls.\n\n\nThese calls are all low frequency sounds that appear to have social communication functions, but what exactly those functions are is not yet known. There is no evidence that right whales' sounds are used for echolocation as is seen in dolphins and toothed whales.\n\n\n\n![](image)Spectrogram of a right whale \"upcall\" recorded in the SE Bering Sea, Sue Moore, NMFS National Marine Mammal Laboratory (help in interpreting spectrograms)\nBetween 2000 and 2006 NOAA researchers deployed passive acoustic listening devices in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska and recorded at least 3,600 North Pacific right whale calls . Nearly all of these calls came from the shallow shelf waters at approximately 70\u00a0m (230\u00a0ft) of the southeastern Bering Sea in what is now designated Critical Habitat for this species. 80% were frequency-modulated \"up-calls\" at an average 90\u2013150\u00a0Hz and 0.7 second duration. \"Down-up\" calls constituted about 5% of the calls, and swept down for 10\u201320\u00a0Hz before becoming a typical \"up-call\". Other call types, *e.g.* downsweeps and constant-tonal \"moans\" constituted less than 10% of total calls. The calls were clumped temporally\u2014apparently involving some level of social interaction, as has been found in the calls of right whales in other oceans. The calls came more at night than during the day.[34][35]\n\n\nThe upcalls of right whales are sufficiently distinct from the calls of other whale species that they can be used to identify the presence of right whales in the area by the calls alone, if care is taken in the review of those calls. Humpback whales also occur in much of the range of the North Pacific right whale, including in the Bering Sea, and parts of the highly variable and complex humpback calls can be similar to right whale calls, similar enough that confirmation that a call is in fact from a right whale usually requires a human to review the entire context of the call rather than simply relying on an algorithm to identify the call as is possible for other species.\n\n\nRight whales in other oceans have been recorded making a percussive vocalization labeled a \"gunshot call\" or gunshot. The role and purpose of this call is uncertain. However, until 2017, it had never been proven than it was right whales in the North Pacific that were the whales making this type of call, so detection of gunshots was not considered a reliable indicator of the presence of right whales.\n\n\nUntil recently it was thought that the most common call used by North Pacific right whales was the \"upcall\". This call is relatively stereotypic among all right whale individuals and populations. The next most common call has been labeled the \"downcall\" and this is also fairly stereotypic. Right whales also make a variety of other frequency-variable calls of different durations. However, these are so varied, they have not been categorized by researchers.\n\n\nUntil recently it was not proven that North Pacific right whales made a percussive call made by right whales in other oceans called a \n\"gunshot\"\u2014that sounds like a shotgun being fired. Gunshot calls appear to be made by males and may be associated with some aspect of mating. Here is a link to audio recordings of these types of calls from a North Atlantic right whale.\n\n\nIn 2017, sophisticated and painstaking research by NOAA scientist Jessica L. Crance and other NOAA scientists was able to definitively attribute gunshots to North Pacific right whales, and found that among the animals sampled gunshots were heard ~50 times more frequently than upcalls.[36] Because gunshots to be used much more and are less likely to be mistaken for a humpback call, this should improve the detectability of right whales in the North Pacific using passive acoustic monitoring, and improve the ability to locate individual whales from ships as well.[36]\n\n\n\n### Habitat preferences[edit]\n\n\nRight whales' habitat preferences vary depending on the time of year. In spring, summer and fall, the right whales are seeking concentrations of food. In winter, in the North Atlantic and Southern Hemisphere, pregnant females and their calves generally seek out shallow, protected bays in which to give birth and raise their calves. In the North Pacific, the pattern of right whales seeking out areas of high food is the same, but female right whales and calves in the North Pacific do not show the clear pattern of concentrating in nearshore aggregations. The distribution of North Pacific right whales in winter remains a major mystery.\n\n\nSince there are so few right whales to observe in the North Pacific, and they are generally feeding far from shore, alternative analyses of habitat preferences are required. Gregr used maps of historic whaling catches and added oceanographic data from other sources to identify preferred habitats. His analysis suggest that on the scale of ocean basins, North Pacific right whales seek out regions of cold water with low inter-annual variability and high within-season variability (i.e. areas where high frontal activity occurred predictably from year to year).[37] However, and a more localized regional scale these correlations weakened.\n\n\nIn winter, North Pacific right whales can occur from the Bering Sea as far south as the Bonin Islands. It is the whales that go south that are frequently seen close to shore. Right whales have historically been found closer to shore in very shallow waters than other large baleen whales, but they are by no means limited to near-shore habitats. There is a record of a female North Atlantic right whale giving birth 63\u00a0km off the shores of Jacksonville, Florida.[38]\n\n\nMany of the very near shore sightings of North Pacific right whales have occurred in Russia, Japan, and South Korea.[39] They have been seen to enter into ports,[40] staying just next to piers or wharfs,[41][42] and there have been regular records of whales being entangled in set nets along Japanese and South Korean coasts[39] in recent years.\n\n\nThere has been a record of rather aggressive interspecies interactions between a right whale and a pod of grey whales off California, making it the only record of possible interspecies aggression among baleen whales,[31] but there have been an observation of social behaviors between the two species on Sakhalin.[33] Furthermore, there is no decent population of grey whales existing outside of North Pacific as of 2014, therefore extents of interspecies competitions, if they've ever happened, or peaceful habitat sharing between these coastal species, before whaling, are unknown. A theory of humpback whales to invade and become a dominant species over Hawaiian islands, former wintering ground for right whales, in the past few centuries, corresponding with the timing of right whale hunts across the Pacific Ocean, had been claimed as well.[43]\n\n\nSummering congregations were known to occur among various areas based on whaling records. Following locations were with larger numbers of catch records: Korf in Olyutorsky,[44] and Kambalny Bay.[45][46] Of these, at least Kambalny Bay still hosts several whales at times; 5 whales were observed from shores in December, 2012.[47]\n\n\n\n## Historic and current population[edit]\n\n\n### Historic population[edit]\n\n\nBefore the arrival of the pelagic whaling fleet after 1835 into the range of the North Pacific right whale, the whale's population size, at least in the eastern part of its range, was probably at its original population size\u2014in the range of 20,000\u201330,000 whales. The part of the whale population in the west around Japan may have been reduced from its original size as a result of the historic net whaling.\n\n\nThere was essentially no aboriginal hunting for right whales along the west coast of North America by Native Americans in the 19th century or before. There was a small hunt for whales in the Aleutian Island by Aleuts but this was almost certainly so small that it did not reduce the original whale population size.[18] Accordingly, one can consider 1835 as a good year to use as a baseline for the historic population, at least in the eastern North Pacific, and the northern parts of the western North Pacific.\n\n\nThere were no attempts to objectively estimate the population in the 1800s, so deriving a population estimate from the number of animals caught in the whale fishery is the only way attempted to date to determine the historic population size. In the single decade of 1840\u201349, between 21,000 and 30,000 right whales were killed in the North Pacific, Sea of Okhotsk and Bering Sea.[21] To support this level of take by whalers in a decade, the population of this slow reproducing species of Okhotsk and nearby waters would have had to be in the range of 20,000\u201330,000 animals at a minimum. For comparison, a population of 20,000 or more animals is comparable to the current and presumably early 19th century population of Gray whales in the North Pacific\n\n\nOn the west side of the North Pacific, the situation was different because the Japanese had a tradition of hunting right whales from shore in Japan with the use of nets which had started centuries before the arrival of American whalers. In Japanese shore-based net whaling, right whales were the prime target, and the whale fisheries were devastating to the stocks[48] as catch quantities declined greatly in relatively short periods,[49] and the effect of the industries were more notable on the whale populations than the later American whaling,[50] resulting not only in financial solvencies of many whaling groups but also in disputes between feudal domains in western Japan that required the shogunate itself to settle.[51] Among this, it has been revealed that Japanese people have been trying to shift responsibility of whale declines to the later American whalers to control public opinions since at the end of the Edo period.[52]\n\n\n\n### Current population[edit]\n\n\nThe current population of North Pacific right whales is estimated at 30\u201335 whales in the eastern North Pacific and 300+ whales in the western portion of its range.[*citation needed*] Even if one considers the combined population size estimate of both apparent stocks of this species, this is the smallest known population of any whale species aside from the North Atlantic right whale (est. 200\u2013250), and probably only 2 percent of its population in 1835 when pelagic whaling first reached the North Pacific. Accordingly, the species is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List and the eastern population is categorized as Extremely Endangered.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe International Whaling Commission and the United States National Marine Fisheries Service consider North Pacific right whales found in these two areas to exist as two somewhat discrete populations and manage them as separate stocks. The extent of independence of these two apparent populations of whales both geographically and genetically is very poorly understood due to lack of data, but discussing them separately is convenient for describing recent sightings and population estimates.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n#### Bering Sea and North East Pacific[edit]\n\n\nMost recent sightings and acoustic records of right whales in the eastern part of their range have come from a relatively small area in the southeastern Bering Sea. Most of these records are within, or near, the U.S. designated Critical Habitat for the North Pacific Right whale. A much smaller number of sightings has come from the Gulf of Alaska and the coasts of British Columbia and further south. The very small number of North Pacific right whale calls detected during the NMFS acoustic research\u2014hundreds per year contrast with the vastly greater number (hundreds of thousands) of bowhead whale calls during migration in the western Arctic and blue whale calls off California\u2014further reinforces the conclusion that the population size of North Pacific right whales in the Bering Sea is very small.[34]\n\n\nA 2015 review of the status of all the baleen whales concluded that genetic and photo-ID mark-recapture analyses each suggest there are only about 30 animals left in the eastern subpopulation, mainly observed in the southeastern Bering Sea and with a male bias to the population.[6] The 2015 reviewers had found no new information that increased the population estimate above that made in 2010 when National Marine Fisheries Service scientists estimated that the population of North Pacific right whales that summer in the southeastern Bering Sea was about 30 animals.\n\n\nPrior estimates of larger current right whale population numbers in the eastern North Pacific were highly speculative. A comprehensive review of sighting data and population estimates in 2001 concluded that \"none of the published estimates of abundance relating to North Pacific right whales can be regarded as reliable\u00a0... [most] estimates appear to be little more than conjecture\u00a0... [and] no quantitative data exist to confirm any of these estimates.\"[11][53]\n\n\nThe 2010 article was the first to present an objective quantitative rationale for its low estimates. The scientists' mark-recapture photographic studies suggested a population of 31 whales (95% confidence level = 23\u201354); and their genotyping study suggested a population of 28 whales (95% confidence level = 24\u201342). The scientists estimated the population contains eight females (95% confidence level = 7\u201318) and 20 males (95% confidence level = 17\u201337). They concluded that \"Although these estimates may relate to a Bering Sea subpopulation, other data suggest that the total eastern North Pacific population is unlikely to be much larger.[54] In 2004, at least two calves were seen.[28]\n\n\nIn the Gulf of Alaska, there have been opportunistic sightings (1998, 2004) and acoustic records (2000) of individual right whales near Kodiak Island.[55]\n\n\nAdditionally, there have been two sightings of individual right whales off British Columbia in 2013.[56] A third sighting was recorded in 2018.[57][58]\n\n\n\n#### Sea of Okhotsk and Western North Pacific[edit]\n\n\nThe 2015 review of whale status concluded that there are more right whales in the western North Pacific than in the eastern region, but even estimates of that population still places it among the world's smallest populations of marine mammal.\n\n\nIn the west, most recent sightings of right whales occur along the Kamchatka Peninsula, in the Kurile Islands, in the Sea of Okhotsk, and the Commander Islands, along the coasts of Japan. A map of this area includes Russian territorial waters (12 miles from shore), Russian Exclusive Economic Zone out to 200 miles from shore, Japanese territorial and EEZ waters, and some international waters, even in the center of the Sea of Okhotsk. As a result, surveys for whales and fisheries have generally not been able to comprehensively survey the region, particularly close to shore, as has been possible to do in the eastern North Pacific.\n\n\n\n##### The Sea of Okhotsk[edit]\n\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, observers on Japanese research vessels reported 28 sightings of right whales in the Sea of Okhotsk. From this sample, the Japanese scientists estimated a population of 900 right whales in the Sea of Okhotsk, albeit with wide confidence intervals (90% CI = 400\u20132,100).[59] Data obtained during Japanese sighting surveys for minke whales in 1989, 1990, and 1992 led Japanese scientists to estimate a population of 922 right whales in the Sea of Okhotsk (95% CI: 404\u20132,108) (Miyashita and Kato 1998, IWC 2001:26). However, the reviewers who prepared the IUCN Red List documentation concluded that given the very wide confidence intervals surrounding the Japanese estimate and the lack of clear evidence of any recent increase in numbers, the lower end of the range of that abundance estimate (i.e., about 400) should be used for assessment (Reilly et al. 2008k). Other scientists also wrote that the Japanese estimate was based on faulty methodology and the population was likely to be only half as large or smaller.[53]\n\n\nAfter a gap of 14 years, Japanese researchers were able to resurvey this area in 2005 and apparently saw similar numbers of right whales in the same area.\n\n\n\n##### Kuril Islands[edit]\n\n\nA team of *National Geographic* and tourism companies encountered three whales at Paramushir and Shumshu, succeeded in swimming and taken underwater images, and aerial footage using a drone in 2017.[60][61][62]\n\n\n\n##### Japan[edit]\n\n\nMore recently, surveys for large whales in offshore waters east of Hokkaido (Japan) and the Kuril Islands from 1994 to 2013 resulted in 55 sightings of right whales (77 individuals) including ten female/calf pairs (Matsuoka et al. 2014).\n\n\n\n##### Kamchatka[edit]\n\n\nThere were 19 sightings of 31 whales in the Russian EEZ (mainly around the northern Kuril Islands, the southern Kamchatka Peninsula and the Commander Islands) between 2003 and 2014 A 2015 review of sightings of right whales seen in Russian waters between 2003 and 2014.[47]\n\n\nAnother 10 sightings of right whales in five groups were reported in 2012 surveys southeast of the Kamchatka Peninsula and off the Kuril Islands (Sekiguchi et al. 2014) and(Ovsyanikova et al. 2015). The 2015 reviewers concluded that all data collected since 1992 in the western North Pacific, especially the Sea of Okhotsk, need to be analyzed for a new abundance estimate so that an assessment can be completed for this subpopulation.[6]\n\n\n\n## Historic and current distribution[edit]\n\n\n### Historic distribution[edit]\n\n\nBefore 1840, the range of the North Pacific right whale was extensive and had probably remained the same for at least hundreds of years. It could be found from the Sea of Okhotsk in the west to the coast of Canada.\n\n\nOur knowledge of the historic distribution of this whale comes almost entirely from the logbooks of the pelagic whalers (and the records of the shore-based whaling in Japan.) The first such effort were a series of charts known subsequently as the Maury \"Whale Charts\".\n\n\nIn the late 1830s, the U.S. Navy sought wind and current information for areas of the oceans outside the trade routes regularly traveled by merchant ships. The principal mariners who ventured away from the main trade routes were whalers. One of the U.S.'s first oceanographers, Naval Captain Matthew Fontaine Maury, entered into an agreement with deal with the American pelagic whalers. If they provided him with their logbooks, from which he could extract wind and current information, he would in return prepare maps for them showing where whales were most concentrated. Between 1840 and 1843, Maury and his staff processed over 2,000 whaling logbooks and produced not only the famous Wind and Current Charts used by mariners for over a century, but also a series of Whale Charts. The most detailed showed by month and 5\u00b0 of latitude and longitude: (a) the number of days on which whaling ships were in that sector; (b) the number of days on which they saw right whales; and (c) the number of days on which the saw sperm whales. In the North Pacific, these charts summarize more than 8,000 days on which the whalers encountered right whales and the searching effort by month and sector. The maps thus provide a crude measure of the relative abundance of right whales by geographic sector and month, controlled for the very non-random searching effort of the whalers.\n\n\nIn 1935, Charles Townsend from the New York Zoological Society (now the Wildlife Conservation Society) reviewed an overlapping set 2,000 whaling logbooks and mapped the locations of whale taken by species. His Chart C[63] shows catch locations around the world, including the location by month of most of the 2,118 right whales taken in the North Pacific between 1839 and 1909, using data copied from 249 logbooks. His charts do not adjust for the nonrandom distribution of whalers. Chart C shows three main concentrations of right whales\u2014one in the Gulf of Alaska; one along Kamchatka and the Sea of Okhotsk; and another in the Sea of Japan.[64][65]\n\n\nMaury's detailed whale charts in this series languished largely forgotten in a few libraries until the 1980s. when they began to be studied more rigorously. The Maury charts have an advantage over the Townsend chart in that the number of whales seen/killed in a given area could be adjusted for the amount of searching effort that had occurred, giving a more accurate indication of the species abundance in that area in that month. The Maury charts also quantify the searching effort by region and month, whereas in the Townsend charts searching effort is dealt with only qualitatively.\n\n\nNorth Pacific whalers hunted mainly in the summer, and that is reflected in the Maury Whale Charts. There were almost no winter sightings and very few south of 20\u00b0N. The densest concentrations occurred along both coasts of Kamchatka and in the Gulf of Alaska.[64]\n\n\nThese initial studies of the historic records were reviewed more rigorously and combined with more recent information in 2004.[48]\n\n\nThe Maury charts were based on tables transcribed by two assistants. More recent examination of the logbooks directly revealed that one of the assistants made numerous errors in the transcription of the logbooks.[66]\n\n\nRecently, the data from the data sheets behind the Maury and Townsend charts and other logbook data has been combined rigorously to provide the best maps yet of distribution of North Pacific right whales in the 19th century.[67]\n\n\nOf particular interest are the questions of how many \"stocks\" of right whales exist in the North Pacific. Was there just a single population across the North Pacific? Was there an eastern population that summered in the Gulf of Alaska and a second population in the western North Pacific? Was the population in the Sea of Okhotsk a third population distinct from the whales found in the Pacific east of Kamchatka?\n\n\nRecently, researchers reanalyzed this early whaling data, along with more recent, but much sparser, sighting data. They conclude that there are probably at least two stocks of right whales in the western and eastern North Pacific, but that it is still unclear whether the Okhotsk population is a separate stock.[24]\nThough the North Pacific right whale's distribution is usually more temperate than that of the more polar Bowhead whale, there are several records of the two species inhabiting the northeastern Sea of Okhotsk at the same time.[68] *E. japonica*'s summer distribution extends north into the southeastern part of the Bering Sea. In summer, the Bowhead migrates north through the Bering Straits and is in the Chukchi Sea and Beaufort Sea. In winter, the ice-loving Bowhead moves south into the Bering Sea, but the right whales have migrated further south of the Aleutian Islands into the North Pacific.\n\n\nCatch records suggest that historical ranges were much broader than that of current status, and was strongly overlapping with ranges of bowhead whales. In Bering Sea, feeding/summering grounds could have reached further north up to the Kusilvak Census Area such as at Kokechik and Scammon Bays in east, north of St. Matthew Island and Nunivak Island[44] to south of the St. Lawrence Island in the central, in Litke Strait and the Karaginsky Island and Karaginsky Gulf in the west.[23]\n\n\n\n### Modern distribution[edit]\n\n\n#### Summer distribution[edit]\n\n\n##### Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of sightings of right whales in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska 1973\u20132007 and designated critical habitat\nDespite many aircraft and ship-based searches,[69] as well as analysis of listening device records, only a few small areas report recent sightings in the eastern North Pacific. The southeastern Bering Sea produced the most, followed by the Gulf of Alaska, and then California. In 2000, 71 calls were recorded by a deep-water passive acoustic site at 53\u00b0N 157\u00b0W\ufeff / \ufeff53\u00b0N 157\u00b0W\ufeff / 53; -157. An additional 10 were recorded near Kodiak Island in the Gulf of Alaska at 57\u00b0N 152\u00b0W\ufeff / \ufeff57\u00b0N 152\u00b0W\ufeff / 57; -152,[70] another whale which is thought to be a sub-adult animal was observed in Uganik Bay in December 2011, being the first modern record of the species on the western side of Kodiak Island.[71][72] This was one of the few sightings that has occurred in inshore waters in the area. One right whale was seen resting in Pasagshak Bay in May 2010.[73][74][75] Other records along Gulf of Alaska include off Yakutat Bay in 1979, outer bank of Fairweather Ground at 100\u00a0km southwest of Cape Fairweather, and so on.\n\n\nOn August 10, 2004, a group of two were seen in the Bering Sea. Another sighting of 17 including two calves was noted in September, and one in the Gulf of Alaska.[28] In 2005, 12 right whales were seen in October just north of Unimak Pass.[11]\n\n\nIn August 2015, NOAA Fisheries conducted a three-week dedicated ship survey for North Pacific right whales in the Gulf of Alaska southeast of Kodiak Island [2] covering 2,500 nautical miles with both visual observers and acoustic detection devices (sonobuoys). On March 10 and March 16 they heard calls from a single right whale in the area of Barnabas Trough southeast of Kodiak Island in the general area of the designated Critical Habitat. Despite intensive searching, they were unable to spot the animals visually.[76]\n\n\nReview of more than 3,600 North Pacific right whale calls detected by passive listening devices between 2000 and 2006 strongly suggests that the whales migrate into the southeast Bering Sea in late spring and remain until late fall. The earliest were in late May and the latest in December. The peak calling period was July through October. Most were detected from shallow shelf sites within the designated Critical Habitat area. From October through December 2005, several calls were detected at the northwestern middle-shelf and the deeper shelf sites, suggesting that they may appear at different seasons and during migration.[34]\n\n\n\n![](image)North Pacific right whale in the Bering Sea, summer 2004, photo by Bob Pitman, NOAA\nA proposed oil and gas lease of North Aleutian Basin in the SE Bering Sea caused the Minerals Management Service (MMS) of the Department of the Interior to fund at an annual cost of about $1 million a cooperative series of annual surveys with the National Marine Fisheries Service and the North Pacific Research Board (NPRB), with a focus on located right whales and gathering further information about them.\n\n\nAn Argos PTT satellite transmitter was deployed in one and the whale was monitored for 58 days, a period in which it remained in a relatively small area within the middle shelf of the Eastern Bering Sea, just to the north of the North Aleutian Basin.[77]\n\n\nA right whale was observed between Alaska Peninsula and Kilokak Rocks in July, 2017 which makes it the first confirmation of the species in the vicinity in the past half century.[78]\n\n\n\n##### Northwestern Pacific[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of the Sea of Okhotsk\nThere are very few reports of right whales in the western North Pacific. A remnant population of right whales persists in the Sea of Okhotsk at least in the summer, along with remnant populations of the western populations of gray and bowhead whales.\n\n\nThe distribution of these three species is quite different. In summer bowheads inhabit the northwestern corner of the Sea of Okhotsk around Academy and Ulban Bays to the Shantar Islands, while gray whales stay close to Sakhalin Island, near massive new energy developments. In contrast, the right whales inhabit the southern Sea of Okhotsk around the Kuril Islands and east of Sakhalin Island.[79][80][81] Some recent sighting records are available.[82]\n\n\nRecent occurrences of right whales near the Kuril islands are largely unknown due to lack of observation effort; however, recent sightings indicate that the areas adjacent to Paramushir Island and surrounding, and west of the southern tip of the Kamchatka Peninsula are seemingly one of the most populated locations for this species today.[23][53][83][84][85][86][87][88]\n\n\nEven though the eastern coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula is considered as a feeding ground for right whales, only a few records exist from the eastern side including sightings in 1978[89] and in 2009.[90][91][92]\n\n\nRight whales were historically hunted in the Commander Islands heavily where only a handful of sightings are made in recent years,[93] however, encounters with this species around the Commander Islands and off eastern Kamchatka seems to occur on a more regular basis compared to the last several decades.[94]\n\n\nThis area's remoteness makes observation very difficult and expensive. Based on survey records from \"JARPN\" and \"JARPN II\" conducted by Institute of Cetacean Research, the 40 right whales seen were distributed mainly in offshore waters from 1994 to 2007.[95]\n\n\nPelagic whalers in the 19th century hunted large numbers of right whales along the coasts of Kamchatka and in the Sea of Okhotsk. The latter area is a large sea, ice covered most of the year, entirely in Russian waters. Due to Russian restrictions on access, little was known about whales in this sea. Soviet scientists indicated that historically two groups of right whales existed within western North Pacific that migrate along different side of Japanese Archipelago and each group had unique characteristics in distribution patterns due to geographical factors; the Okhotsk group which was distributed in more coastal waters with higher densities of congregations, and the Pacific group which have been distributed on far broader ranges and more was more oceanic (offshore).[23] Of these, the Okhotsk group were regarded to be wiped out much earlier than the Pacific group because of geographical and distribution characteristics that eased whalers to hunt the targets, and this indication corresponds with the extreme rarity or virtual extinction of right whales in Sea of Japan or East China and South China Sea today.\n\n\nSurvey records from \"JARPN\" and \"JARPN II\" conducted from 1994 to 2007 by the Institute of Cetacean Research detected 28 groups of right whales totaling 40 individuals with 6 cow-calf pairs distributed mainly in offshore waters.[95]\n\n\nIn summer 2009, a co-operative cetacean sighting survey was conducted in the Sea of Okhotsk by the Japanese National Research Institute of Far Seas Fisheries and the Russian (VNIRO) institute.[83] During this survey, 17 groups of 29 right whales were recorded and photographed. Analysis of the photographs revealed no matches among the individuals resulting in a minimum record of 29 whales encountered during the survey.\n\n\nBesides offshore waters, three major hot spots for right whales where with good increases in sighting numbers have been confirmed in coastal Russian waters have been detected:[96] the Commander Islands, the First Kurilskiy Strait (between Cape Lopatka and Paramushir Island),[97] and the east coast of Sakhalin including Piltun Bay, the only congregating area known for endangered western gray whales.\n\n\nPelagic waters off southeastern Kamchatka Peninsula is the location possibly with the highest sighting frequency in recent years even though this area is far offshore and it is unclear where these whales migrate southward.[82]\n\n\n\n#### Migration[edit]\n\n\nPast thinking about North Pacific right whale migration presumed a paradigm of migratory behavior similar to that of other baleen whales in the North Pacific. Perhaps the extreme example of North Pacific whale migration is that of Gray whale. Nearly all the Gray whales that summer in the Bering Sea migrate to wintering grounds off Baja California. In summer and winter, nearly all the gray whales are either at the northern or southern ends of their range. Initially scientists assumed that North Pacific right whales had similar migratory pattern.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAnalysis of 19th century pelagic whaling suggest that North Pacific right whales do migrate south in winter, but the whaling data did not indicate any specific migratory routes as seen in gray whales. The 19th century whalers travelled north in spring and south in fall. To some extent the apparent North Pacific right whale migration shown in the whaling data is an artifact of bias in the whaling effort.\n\n\nMore recent studies of right whales in North Atlantic and the North Pacific suggest a migratory pattern that is quite different than the gray whale example. In the North Atlantic, many right whales remain in the northern part of their range throughout winter.[*citation needed*] It appears that while some right whales migrate far south to warmer waters, a substantial percentage of the population either does not migrate as far south or may not migrate at all.\n\n\nThe collection of acoustic records of North Pacific right whales has revealed that portions of the North Pacific right whale population remains in the Bering Sea at least as late as December and as early as January. The acoustic research done in the Unimak Pass has shown right whales passing through this pass.[98]\n\n\nNo coastal or other wintering ground has been found for North Pacific right whales.[48][64] Which factors cause right whales not to favor inshore waters is unknown. Off the west coast of the United States, Point Conception is a turning location in terms of sighting records in the 19th and 20th centuries,[99] and this may contribute to support the once-abandoned idea; existence of historical breeding grounds in coastal waters including along North American continent.[100] Ryukyu Islands had been suggested as a wintering ground for the western population, but little evidence supports this.[101] According to Maury's chart, in winter, some concentrations could be seen at several areas such as the southern Sea of Japan, around southern coasts of Korean Peninsula (such as around today's Dadohaehaesang National Park on southwestern Korean Peninsula[102]) and Jeju Island,[103] areas off Shanghai and the Zhoushan archipelago, Taiwan Strait (e.g. Fujian coasts like Pingtan Island, Penghu Islands, west coast of Taiwan), the northwestern Hawaiian Islands.[23] (with smaller areas scattered among southern Korean and Japanese waters). In Asia, southernmost of areas with higher catch densities were the pelagic waters between continental China (latitudes equal to Shanghai and Zhoushan Islands) and west of Kyushu in south to southern coasts of Korean Peninsula during the summer.[102] Some whales were caught off Hainan Island and this area is possibly the southernmost location of known range for the western population. The whales are also known to occur around the northern Mariana Islands.[104][105] A map had been academically created which forecasts potential wintering habitats for right whales in north Pacific according to environmental factors corresponding to that of north Atlantic species, including further south to Hainan, Leizhou Peninsula, and northern Gulf of Tonkin.[106] Historical occurrences of vagrancy around Borneo have been considered as well,[107] while possibilities of migrations to or through Philippines are unclear.\n\n\nThe population (s) historically migrated through the Sea of Japan to the Yellow and Bohai Seas was likely driven to functional extinction. No right whales have been recorded in China and in South Korea since the catches in October 1974 for Korea[39][108] and 1977 for China, and there have been only two confirmed records of a stranded and a by-caught individuals since in 1901 in Japanese waters of the Sea of Japan.[109]\n\n\nConstant appearances in both sides of Pacific were recorded until 1998 and all the southernmost records at four locations of almost same latitude were made in both sides around 1996\u201397; Amami \u014cshima, Bonin Islands, Hawaii, Cabo San Lucas.[75][110] Last records off west coast were in 1998 off Cape San Martin and Monterey. Afterwards, any records ceased until 2014. In Bonin Islands and off Oregon and California, constant occurrences were confirmed in the 1990s. What factors caused sudden rise in sighting trends in the 2010s and disappearance in the 2000s in many of former range especially for mid-lower latitudes are unknown. The Bonin Islands are the only location where sighting interval of constance was confirmed and succeed underwater filming in modern times. Off Japan, sudden rises in number were confirmed in 2003, 2006, 2008, and in 2011 where an exceptionally large number was recorded in 2011; at least 3 or more sightings, 1 entanglement, 1 stranding of 18\u00a0m animal. Fragments of a lower jaw, measuring 4.6 m in length and likely to be artificially sliced off, was discovered on a beach in Akkeshi in June 2014.[111]\n\n\n\n#### Western North Pacific[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Wildlife of China\n\n##### Japan[edit]\n\n\nThe occurrence of North Pacific right whales in Japanese waters appears to show several patterns. Historic and modern sightings appear to occur more frequently in three areas: (1) the north, particularly north of Hokkaido, (2) along the coasts of central Japan, and (3) among Japan's southern islands, particularly the Bonin Islands.\n\n\nThe waters around and north of Hokkaido historically where regions where 19th century pelagic whalers hunted for right whales during summer and fall. This region and north through the Kuril Islands, the southern Sea of Okhotsk and Kamchatka were feeding grounds for the right whales. Some of the recent sightings of right whales off Japan are consistent with this pattern.\n\n\nRight whales were formerly abundant off the coast of northeastern Japan where there have been a few sightings in recent years including observations from ICR research surveys (single animals confirmed off Kushiro, Hokkaido, in September 2002[112] and off the Pacific coast of Honshu in April 2003).[113] Local fishermen have regularly seen a few animals per year in the area (personal contact). There is one unconfirmed sighting off the Shiretoko Peninsula in 2008.[114]\n\n\nA breaching right whale was observed during a sightseeing cruise off the Shiretoko Peninsula in July 2013 making it the first confirmed sighting in the area for several decades and the first recorded in Hokkaido.[25][115] A right whale, most likely the same individual, was seen in the area for the following two weeks until a pod of local killer whales came back to Shari coasts. The observer noted many of local tour-operating boats cruising at high speeds did not seem to detect the whale resting on water surface and forced the right whale to submerge quickly to avoid collisions. In 2018 and 2019, additional sightings have been made from the west coast of the peninsula. 2018 sighting and one of two sightings in 2019 have been made by the same tour operator, Doutou Kanko Kaihatsu (Corporation) (jp:\u9053\u6771\u89b3\u5149\u958b\u767a).[116][117]\n\n\nThe occurrence of right whales along the coasts of central Japan appears to reflect the migration of right whales past these points. There are some locations along the Pacific side of Honshu where sightings are particularly more common; from south of Tokyo Bay to all around the Izu Peninsula, from the Izu Islands to the Bonin Islands, the Kii Peninsula, Cape Muroto and adjacent waters. In the first area, there was one entanglement freed alive in April 2000 off Tateyama, and two strandings at Izu \u014cshima in 2002 and 2005.\n\n\nSome right whales still migrate south along Japan's coasts particularly the Pacific side of the archipelago, but what portion of the southward migration passes Japan is unknown.\n\n\nThe occurrence of right whales among the southern Japanese islands suggest that a wintering ground may occur around there.\n\n\nAn 18\u00a0m (59\u00a0ft) right whale was entangled off Kamogawa coast in May,[118] but escaped while another 15\u201318\u00a0m (49\u201359\u00a0ft) carcass was seen floating off Cape Nozaki.[119] A right whale of 10\u00a0m (33\u00a0ft) was sighted on January 28, 2014, making it the first record in the East China Sea in the 21st century.[120] One whale about the same size entered the port of Ushibuka, Kumamoto on March 28, 2014.[121][122]\n\n\nIn addition, possibly two different animals were seen off Bonin Islands on 12th[123] and 25th[124] March 2014. Later one was larger, and was curious towards whale-watching vessels.[30] The whale was observed interacting with a Humpback whale. Izu and Bonin Islands are regions with highest confirmed sightings and strandings rates among tropical regions in the past century. In 1993,[125] Yasuhiro Morita of Ogasawara Diving Center succeeded in encountering right whales on four occasions near the Bonin Islands.\n\n\nMost of recent sightings have occurred along the Japanese coast. Historically, right whales may have wintered in the East China Sea from the Ryukyu Islands to south of China including Taiwan though there is little scientific evidence supporting this idea. Modern sightings in the East and South China Seas, or Yellow and Bohai Seas are very rare, and the number of records is small.[126][127] Only a few confirmed sightings in the area have occurred, and all the 5 records in the East China Sea in the last 110 years were recorded only on Amami \u014cshima island and with Sukomobanare Island.[26][118][128][129][130] Additionally, all of the modern records of right whales on mainland coasts of China were concentrated on the island of Haiyang in northern Yellow Sea.[131]\n\n\nRight whales may have wintered in the Bonin Islands, but few sightings in recent decades support this idea.[101] The Ogasawara Whale-watching Association reported seeing 3 groups of 4 different right whales in the Bonin Islands in the 1990s (two animals from different groups were photographed and recorded on underwater video);[132][133] A pair of possible right whales were seen migrating south outside the port of Aogashima in December 2007.[134] Another group of 2 or 3 animals appeared just off Mikura island in March 2008.[135] One animal was sighted very close to shore in Niijima, 2011 (later described). A small right whale was seen nearby Manazuru Peninsula on April 3, and one or two right whales were sighted off Miyake Island on April 21, 2016.[136]\n\n\nOff the Kii peninsula, there was one sighting in June 1999, one mortal entanglement in April 2003, and three records of two animals in the spring-summer 2006 (both from many whale watching vessels).[137][138][139][140][141][142][143] One of these whales was very active. A right whale escaped alive from a fishing net near Taiji Town in January 2009,[144][145][146][147] a very close observation during whale watching tour (later described) in April 2011. An individual was sighted off Kushimoto within a pod of rough-toothed dolphins in February, 2016.[148] Off Cape Muroto, two entanglements (both escaped safely) were reported in February 1971[149][150][151] and February 2008.[152] Two adults stranded in the northern and southern Ibaraki Prefecture in 2003[153] and 2009.[154]\n\n\nModern sightings in the Japan Sea are very seldom made. Some strandings were reported from the 1970s to late 2000s, but none of the possible sightings of right whales were published or confirmed. Whaling of right whales continued until 1978 in the Sea of Japan.[155] A photo of a Right whale being hunted in 1922 in the Sea of Japan is available.[156]\n\n\nUnusually high numbers of right whales were recorded off Japan from February to mid-April 2011. One mature female of 18\u00a0m (59\u00a0ft) body length was stranded on the Shimoda coast on the southern Izu Peninsula.[157] Carcass of this individual was not covered by barnacles.[158] It had been previously sighted off Inatori, and another animal was sighted very close to shore off Inatori again. A photo and a video are available.[159][160] Another possible right whale was observed just outside a port in Manaduru in May (no photo was taken).[161]\n\n\nIn the Izu Islands, one whale was observed very close to shore, tail-slapping for an extended period of time.[41][42][162][163] No photo of its head was taken.\n\n\nOff Kii Peninsula, in April 2011, the same whale-watching operator who had encountered two right whales in 2006 had a very close encounter with a right whale. This whale was very curious and active; it swam around a vessel for more than 2 hours, displayed all the aerial actions several times (breaching, spyhopping, tail-slapping, pec-slapping) alongside the vessel, and the vessel had to cruise away from the whale because it kept following the vessel. Many professional whale photographers were on this tour, some of them were also on the board when this tour operator during the 2006 sightings.[164][165][166][167]\n\n\nSome whale watching or touring companies have encountered with several right whales or on several occasions such as several companies associated with Ogasawara Whale Watching Association (four animals in the 1990s), Nanki Marine Leisure Service (three animals in 2006 and 2011), Mikura Island Tourism Association (two whales in 2008), Godzilla-rock cruise (*Gojira-iwa kank\u014d*) and its subsidiary, Shiretoko Fox Cruise since the 2000s (more than three times at least), Heritage Expeditions (at least three whales in the 2010s).\n\n\nA young right whale was killed when it entangled itself in a net off \u014cita Prefecture in March 2011.[168] In fact, this was reported by a biologist who saw a right whale's meat being sold at a local market, later reported to a local aquarium.\n\n\nA sailor on a yacht had a very close encounter with a cow-calf pair breaching off Miura Peninsula in the earlier 2000s. This sighting was later confirmed by a local marine biologist working at an aquarium.[169]\n\n\n\n### Wintering/calving grounds[edit]\n\n\nNo coastal or other wintering ground has been found for North Pacific right whales.[48][64] Which factors cause right whales not to favor inshore waters is unknown.\n\n\nMost recent sightings of *E. japonica* occurred near the coasts;[170] however, as of 2014, none of studies to detect the wintering/calving grounds for *E. japonica* have been successful though there is an ongoing project by North Pacific Research Board to locate those areas with a hypothetical situation that *E. japonica* historically preferred coastal waters along east coasts of North American continent.[171]\n\n\nReviewing of other *Eubalaena* species' biology, as the population of *E. australis* in New Zealand primarily use subantarctic Auckland and Campbell Islands as wintering/calving grounds, and the majority of non-calving adults of *E. glacialis* winter in pelagic waters of Bay of Fundy with recent records of new-born calves present in the region. These areas are known to be feasible for feeding/summering; hence, it is possible that it is not always necessarily for right whales in North Pacific to migrate to warmer waters for wintering/calving, and historical wintering ranges could have been much broader than previously considered. Large portions of southern rights also wintered in pelagic waters in the past, from sub-polar to nearby Equator regions.[172]\n\n\nIn winter, the whales' distribution is particularly mysterious. There have been a few sightings close to shores in California and even Baja, particularly in the 1990s along locations like La Jolla, Point Sur, Big Sur coasts, Piedras Blancas,[173] San Simeon, Point Montara, and in Santa Barbara Channel.[174] They have been rare, of short duration and none since 1998.[175] Largest numbers of whales sighted at one times in eastern Pacific outside of SE Bering Sea since after the late 20th century were of 8 animals off Destruction Island in 1959, sightings off Cape Flattery of 3 whales in and 1967 and 6 or 7 whales in 1973,[64] 4 whales at the mouth of Yakutat Bay in March 1979, a pod of 2 or 3 whales at Three Arch Rocks in Oregon in 1994,[176] and likely a pair seen off southwest of San Miguel Island in February 2015.[177] In the western Pacific, the latest of recent records were of a close encounter by a yachter with a cow-calf pair off Sajima Island in Sagami Bay in the early 2000s[169] and a pod appeared close to the pier on Mikura Island in 2008.\n\n\n\n#### Eastern North Pacific[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A right whale off Anacapa Island in May 2017.\nOff the west coast of the United States, Point Conception is a turning location in terms of sighting records in the 19th and 20th centuries,[99] and this may contribute to support the once-abandoned idea; existence of historical breeding grounds in coastal waters including along North American continent.[100]\n\n\nUntil recently, most researchers thought that right whales in the eastern North Pacific wintered off the west coast of North America, particularly along the coasts of Washington, Oregon and California. There have been few winter sightings in all these areas, particularly in California. A more detailed study argues that these single individuals were merely stragglers. Notwithstanding 7 days/week whale-watching operations in several parts of this range, there have been only 17 sightings between Baja and Washington state.[75] The absence of calves from historic California stranding data suggests that this area was never an important calving or wintering ground.[18] When a right whale was observed along the coast of La Jolla in 2017, the animal was initially misidentified as a gray whale.[178]\n\n\n\n#### Western North Pacific[edit]\n\n\nModern observation of right whales in southern Japan and in Izu and Bonin Islands, and in Amami \u014cshima, didn't show any signs of whales spending long periods there (although being relaxed, resorting activities[*clarification needed*] have been confirmed[30]) and mostly whales left in a few days, thus where these individuals spent most time in those winters are largely unclear. Only record of longer staying was of Shiretoko sighting in 2013 as possibly the same individual stayed along western coasts of the peninsula for two weeks, and this case was in summer.[115] It is unclear whether the two sightings from the same area on June 25 and July 19, 2019, belong to the same individual (see above).\n\n\nThere are remote (hence less pressures from impacts of human activities) and unstudied areas still possessing less \u2013 damaged environments where right whales were historically distributed, scattering among North Pacific and adjacent waters. These include northern proportions of Sea of Japan within Russian, North Korean, and Japanese EEZ such as along Primorsky Krai like Rudnaya Bay and Peter the Great Bay, northern Korean Peninsula and adjacent islands such as at East Korea Bay, Ulleungdo, Oki Islands, pacific islands, atolls, seamounts, and guyots in lower latitude such as Ladd Seamount,[106] north of Northern Mariana Islands, north of Babuyan Islands, small, outer islands and atolls of Taiwan and those in South China Sea such as Pengjia Islet, Green Island, Lanyu, adjacent to Kenting and Dapeng Bay like Xiaoliuqiu, Dongsha Atoll, and vicinity to Marshall Islands,[104] and Midway Islands. According to other *Eubalaena* species' seasonal distribution, some proportions of Pacific right whales could winter in colder waters, and congregation areas could also be restricted into particular harbors or straits of particular oceanic islands.[179] It could be also said that wintering distributions of *E. japonica* could have extended further south to regions near the Equator line, according to the historical distributions of right whales in South Pacific that a population existed to winter on pelagic waters on lower latitude which is comparable to latitudes of Diego Garcia, Egmont Islands, and Great Chagos Bank,[172] or even crossing the line on occasions where *E. australis* have been known to reach Kiribati,[180] Gabon,[181] and *E. glacialis* likely migrated south to Mauritania to Senegal in the past.[182]\n\n\n\n### Korea[edit]\n\n\nThe first record of a living animal since after the whaling in the Sea of Japan occurred at Namhae near Busan in February 2015, 41 years after the last record in the Korean EEZ.[39][183]\n\n\n\n### China[edit]\n\n\nThere was a sighting off Shenzhen in 2015 although this was broadcast a humpback whale,[184] and the first stranding of the species was recorded on Shandong Province between 2000 and 2006.[185]\n\n\n\n## Whale watching[edit]\n\n\nThere have been several locations where right whales have been observed regularly close to shore among western north Pacific in recent years, but to observe right whales purposely in commercial operations is a different story. Expedition tours targeting Sea of Okhotsk, Kamchatka, and Commander islands region allows the highest possibilities to observe these whales, however, to encounter with North Pacific right whales during whale watching tours are extremely low, only a handful of operators around the world have had. One extraordinary case occurred in Japan. \"Nanki Marine Leisure Service\", a whale-watching operator working off Kumano-nada sea had 2 encounters of different animals in 2006, and another one in 2011.[186] For sighting in 2011, it could be one of the most well-recorded observations ever in the history as some of aerial behaviors was observed for the first time such as keep following vessels over several hours, continuously displaying almost all-known surface behaviours of the species in a row. Several cameramen were on board both in 2006 and 2011, and Kenji Oda, a professional whale cameraman had two encounters in 2006 and later.[187] The Bonin islands is the location with the second-highest sighting rates during commercial tours,[30] followed by the Izu Islands.\n\n\n\n## Threats[edit]\n\n\nIn adopting a Recovery Plan for the North Pacific right whale, the United States government (NOAA) described its evaluation of the various threats to the continued survival of the species.[188]\n\n\n\n### Unsustainably small population[edit]\n\n\nWhen populations of wild animals get very small, the population becomes much more vulnerable to certain risks than larger populations. One of these risks is inbreeding depression.[11]\n\n\nA second risk of very small populations is their vulnerability to adverse events. In its 2006 Status Review, NMFS stated *E. japonica*'s low reproductive rates, delayed sexual maturity, and reliance on high juvenile survivorship combined with its specialized feeding requirements of dense schools of copepods \"make it extremely vulnerable to environmental variation and demographic stochasticity at such low numbers\".[11] For example, a localized food shortage for one or more years may reduce the population below a minimum size. As the NMFS Status Review notes: \"Zooplankton abundance and density in the Bering Sea has been shown to be highly variable, affected by climate, weather, and ocean processes and in particular ice extent.\"[11]\n\n\nA third risk is an inability to find mating partners. With so few whales in such a large area, simply finding a mate is difficult. Right whales generally travel alone or in very small groups. In other oceans, breeding females attract mates by calling. The success of this strategy depends upon having males within hearing range. As expanding shipping traffic increases the ocean's background noise, the audible range for such mating calls has decreased.\n\n\n\n### Oil exploration, extraction, transport and spills[edit]\n\n\nOil and gas exploration and production in the right whale's range could threaten the species' survival as a result of oil spills, other pollution, ship collisions and noise. In its 2006 Status Review, NMFS notes that the development of the Russian oil fields off the Sakhalin Islands in the Sea of Okhotsk \"is occurring within the habitat\" of the western population of North Pacific right whales.[11]\n\n\nThere have been recent oil spills in the Bering Sea. In 2005, the wreck of the M/V *Selendang Ayu* near Unalaska released approximately 321,000 US gallons (7,400\u00a0imp\u00a0bbl) of fuel oil and 15,000 US gallons (350\u00a0imp\u00a0bbl) of diesel into the Bering Sea.\n\n\nThe exploration phase of oil development is characterized by numerous ships engaged in seismic testing to map undersea geological formations. Testing involves blasts of noise which echo off the undersea rock formations. These explosions have been banned in the Beaufort Sea during the time of year that bowheads are present. In its 2006 Status Review, NMFS concludes: \"In general, the impact of noise from shipping or industrial activities on the communication, behavior and distribution of right whales remains unknown.\"[11]\n\n\nOn April 8, 2008, a NMFS review found that there had been no recent Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas activities in or adjacent to the areas designated as critical habitat for *E. japonica*.[189] On the same day, the U.S. Minerals Management Service (MMS) published a notice of a proposed Oil and Gas Lease Sale 214 for 5,600,000 acres (23,000\u00a0km2) in the North Aleutian Basin. In January 2009, the MMS reported in a Scoping Report for the Environmental Impact Statement for the Lease Sale that \"Many commentators expressed concern about impacts resulting from industrial activity and noise to the North Pacific right whales.\"[190] More than half of the proposed Oil and Gas Lease Sale 214 in the Bering Sea is within the designated critical habitat of the North Pacific right whale.[191]\n\n\nOn March 31, 2010, President Obama issued a memorandum for the Secretary of the Interior withdrawing Sale 214 from disposition by leasing through June 30, 2017, the Bristol Bay area of the North Aleutian Basin in Alaska.[192] Right whales were not mentioned specifically in the reasons for this withdrawal.[193]\n\n\n\n### Environmental changes[edit]\n\n\nThe habitat of *E. japonica* is changing in ways that threaten its survival. Two environmental effects of particular concern are global warming and pollution.\n\n\nThe high densities of copepods that right whales require for normal feeding are the result of high phytoplankton productivity and currents which aggregate the copepods. Satellite studies of right whales show them traveling considerable distances to find these localized copepod concentrations.[194]\n\n\nGlobal warming can affect both copepod population levels and the oceanographic conditions which concentrate them. This ecological relationship has been studied intensively in the western North Atlantic.\n\n\n\n### Hybridization with bowhead whales[edit]\n\n\nRecently, scientists have begun to notice that the warming Arctic Ocean and land is resulting in changed distribution of species with the result of breaking down climate barriers that have prevented hybridization between closely related species. The most reported examples have been the three confirmed grizzly\u2013polar bear hybrids. In 2010, a team led by National Marine Mammal Laboratory ecologist Brendan Kelly counted 34 possible hybridizations between distinct populations or species of Arctic marine mammals, many of which are endangered or threatened. These observed hybridizations included in 2009, a cross between a bowhead whale and a North Pacific right whale in the Bering Sea. Kelly stated that \"The breedings between the North Pacific right whale, whose numbers have fallen below 200, and the more numerous bowhead whale, could push the former to extinction. (Over time, the hybrids would begin to outnumber the sparse right whales.)\" Co-author Andrew Whitely wrote: \"Breedings between these marine mammals near the North Pole are likely to result in fertile offspring, because many of these animals have the same number of chromosomes...[and] Over the short term the hybrid offspring from these Arctic animal matings will likely be strong and healthy, because unlike inbreeding, which magnifies deleterious genes, so-called outbreeding can mask these genes\u00a0... But over time, as the hybrids mate randomly, those harmful genes will come out of hiding and make the offspring less fit and less capable of surviving.\"[195][196]\n\n\nIn Sea of Okhotsk, habitat sharing with an endangered population of bowhead whales have been confirmed at northern parts of the sea especially within the region contains Akademii and Ul'bansky Bays as well as critically endangered western gray whales.[197] Whales may appear into northeastern part as well such as Shelikhov Gulf.[198] Extent of effect to both species by habitat sharing is unknown.\n\n\n\n### Entanglement in fishing gear and interaction with marine debris[edit]\n\n\nIn its 2013 evaluation of the threats to survival of the North Pacific right whale, NOAA examined the possible impacts of entanglement in fishing gear and ingestion of marine debris. Entanglement in fishing gear is a major threat to the survival of the North Atlantic right whale. Marine debris includes, among other items, abandoned or lost fishing gear and small plastic items that could be ingested.[188]\n\n\nThere is year around commercial fishing in the range of the North Pacific right whale in both the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska. and also in the western part of its range around Kamchatka, the sea of Okhotsk, and the Japan. Entanglement in fishing gear can both result in the death of the whale relatively quickly, or result in long-term stress that reduces the whale's health leading to less reproduction or death.\n\n\nAs more attention has been paid to the issue of whale entanglement with fishing gear, more records of entanglements are discovered. Here is a list of entanglements of North Pacific right whales in fishing gear:\n\n\n\n* February 2015 \u2013 a young right whale became entangled in the ropes of a musselaquaculture operation in Korea. (The whale was eventually released.)[39][199][200][201]\n\n\nIn the eastern Bering Sea gear is deployed in nearshore waters, areas \"not associated and generally not overlapping with known North Pacific right whale distribution.\" Pot fisheries occur in offshore waters, but are often deployed in winter when right whales are not known to be present.[11]\n\n\n\n* October 2016 \u2013 Japan, a 9.5m whale was killed in entanglement in the Volcano Bay, Hokkaido. The body was processed to products on sale.[202]\n* June 2013 \u2013 British Columbia, Canada. One of the two right whales seen had serious injuries to its rostrum that appear to have been caused by entanglement in fishing gear.[203]\n* 2011 \u2013 Japan a young right whale was killed by being entangled in net in \u014cita Prefecture.[168] This death was reported by a biologist who saw a right whale's meat being sold at a local market, later reported[*citation needed*] to a local aquarium.\n\n\nIn the Sea of Okhotsk entanglement in fishing gear, like deep-water crab traps and Japanese pelagic driftnet gear for salmon may be a significant problem.\n\n\nAll the modern records of entanglement have involved Japanese fisheries including cases in the Russian Far East in which about 60% of all cetacean (medium to larger species) entanglements recorded in the Sea of Okhotsk were caused by Japanese fisheries.[204]\n\n\n\n* August 3, 2003 \u2013 in the Sea of Okhotsk at 47\u00b004'580\"N 146\u00b0-06-566\"E two right whales sighted in 3,200\u00a0m water depth. One of the whales had a big scar anterior to the blowhole caused by fishing gear such as the mainline from crab nets (photos).[205]\n* December 25, 1996 \u2013 in the Sea of Okhotsk, one right whale found alive but entangled in crab net gear. The whale was released from the gear, but escaped carrying 5\u00a0m of mainline still attached.[205]\n* September 1, 1995 \u2013 in the Sea of Okhotsk, one whale dead from entanglement in unspecified gear at 50\u00b030'N 150\u00b039'E[205]\n* August 1992 \u2013 Sea of Okhotsk one whale found alive with fishing gear wrapped on the tail flukes[205]\n* 1994 \u2013 Japan (October) dead from entanglement in Japanese drift net[53]\n\n\n### Ship collisions[edit]\n\n\nCollisions with commercial ships are the greatest threat to North Atlantic right whales. Both summer feeding ranges and winter calving grounds are located in busy shipping channels.[11] *E. japonica* does not frequent shipping channels. In the North Pacific, this threat is probably smaller, but it still exists.\n\n\nAll larger cetaceans passing through under threats of being struck by vessels on various sea-lanes in Asian nations,[206] especially in the Tsushima Strait. Japanese Coast Guard has started to collect sighting records of large whales in the area, but majorities of species identities of each records are unspecified in their log, hence it is unknown if any right whales have ever been actually sighted.[207]\n\n\n\n### Ship noise[edit]\n\n\nIn its 2013 Recovery Plan, NOAA reviewed the scientific evidence on the effects of ship noise on right whales at length. No studies have been done on North Pacific right whales due to the difficulty of even finding them. Several studies have been done on North Atlantic right whales which are reviewed. Ship noise in the oceans has increased dramatically due to both the amount of shipping and the exploration for oil and gas. The increased noise may make right whales more vulnerable to being struck by ships. It may also impose a sublethal level of stress on them that might impact their health. (citation).[208]\n\n\nNOAA concluded that \"the severity of ship noise to North Pacific right whales is unknown and uncertainty of the threat is high. Therefore, the relative impact to recovery is ranked as **unknown**.\"\n\n\n\n### Predation[edit]\n\n\nThe 2013 U.S. Recovery Plan noted that there is \"currently no evidence\" of predation on North Pacific right whale by killer whales, and that none of the photos of North Pacific right whales showed no images of tooth rake marks typical of killer whale attacks, but \"this is not to suggest\u00a0... this predation does not occur, only that it has not been observed\".\n\n\nThere are records of sharks attacking North Atlantic right whales on their calving grounds.[209] In the Canadian Arctic 17 Inuit reported having seen killer whales attack bowhead whales.[210][211]\n\n\nThe U.S. Recovery Plan concludes that any predation would likely have a larger impact on calf and subadult age classes, and that the relative impact to recovery from predation is ranked as low severity and medium uncertainty.\n\n\n\n### Whaling[edit]\n\n\nHistoric whaling is the reason North Pacific right whales are so endangered today. The two critical periods of whaling were 1839 to 1849 (pelagic whaling, 90% American ships) and 1963 to 1968 (illegal Soviet whaling). The illegal Soviet whaling in the 1960s killed 514 right whales in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska to plus 136 right whales in the Sea Okhotsk and the Kuril Islands.[212]\n\n\nAlthough whaling was the principal threat to North Pacific right whales, there is no record of whalers targeting this species since the 1980s. Accordingly, this threat appears minor at this time.[53]\n\n\n\n### Lack of funding for management, research and conservation[edit]\n\n\nTrying to research and manage human interactions with whale populations that are spread out geographically in remote areas and hard to locate is expensive. With governments around the North Pacific facing reductions in budgets, funding for such efforts are becoming increasingly difficult to obtain. Most of the research on the right whales in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska was funded as part of proposed leases for oil and gas exploration that recently have been deferred and that funding ended. The U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service reports \"currently there is no funding at all for North Pacific right whale research despite the critically endangered nature of this population.\"[16]\n\n\nIn Japan, the only system of collecting reports of large whales along the Japanese coast is the ICR Strandings Record \u2013 this applies only to stranded individuals, hence the limited knowledge about the biology of free-swimming right whales in Japan. There were more unpublished or unreported sightings of right whales confirmed by locals in recent years in which some important observations such as a cow-calf pairs observation close to shore are included (personal contact). For example, a sailor on a yacht had a very close encounter with a cow-calf pair breaching off Miura Peninsula in earlier 2000s. This sighting was later confirmed by a local marine biologist working at an aquarium.[169]\n\n\n\n## Conservation[edit]\n\n\n### The challenge of finding right whales[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Distinctive V-shaped blow of a right whale in the Bristol Bay feeding ground Alaska (Identification of a whale as a right whale requires more than just a photo of the blow shape because some gray whales can also produce V-shaped blows.)\nA threshold problem for conserving this species is locating them. Other right whale species can reliably be found on their feeding grounds (North Atlantic right whale), or on their wintering grounds (both North Atlantic and Southern right whale).[213] In contrast, there are no reliable places where researchers can find North Pacific right whales. In the eastern portion of their range, there are so few whales that researchers have described it looking for a needle in a haystack. In the western portion of their range, the ability of researchers to find right whales in the Sea of Okhotsk and Kuril Islands is greatly hindered by the difficulty and expense of getting access to these areas which are in Russian territorial waters and EEZ, and by the fog that makes visibility minimal.\n\n\nUntil recently nearly all the records of North Pacific right whales have been visual observations from ships or from shore. However, on their summer grounds in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska, the sea conditions are frequently so rough, windy and/or foggy that detection of right whales known to be present is problematic. In 2015, a NOAA research cruise in the Bering Sea off Kodiak focused on finding right whales detected acoustic signals on two occasions from a right whale, but in neither case were the researchers able to visually locate the whales.[214] Previous NOAA dedicated ship surveys in the southeast Bering Sea also have had only sporadic success in visibly locating right whales. A month-long NOAA dedicated research cruises in August 2007 in the southeast Bering Sea sighted no right whales.[215]\n\n\nMore recently, scientists have increasingly been using a new technology to acoustically detect right whales. As described above, right whales make calls that can be distinguished from the calls of other species so that researchers have concluded they such detections constitute reliable records based solely on the acoustic recordings.\nThe technology is able to detect submerged animals, independent of water clarity.[216][217]\n\n\nAcoustic searching for North Pacific right whales has been done with two types of listening devices. Directional and ranging sonobuoy are floating devices that are deployed from ships are monitored for short periods of time (hours) from ships. Alternate listening devices are permanently moored acoustic recorders that acoustically sample over long periods (months) until the acoustic is retrieved by a ship.\n\n\nAcoustic detection and visual searches are often used in conjunction. Right whales are detected acoustically then are located visually by shipboard observers. In August 2004, NOAA listening devices in the southeastern Bering Sea detected right whale vocalizations. The researchers then deployed directional and ranging sonobuoys to locate the calling whales. This information allowed researchers to find visually the whales and photograph, biopsy dart (to collect genetic samples) and tag two whales.[28]\n\n\nResearchers have also developed increasingly sophisticated and durable satellite tags that can be attached to whales, including right whales. These tags can collect information for months about the long-distance travels of whales, and have produced information on movements of right whales in the North Atlantic and Southern Hemisphere.[*citation needed*] satellite-monitored radio tags. These are non-lethal, and applied with a crossbow, can beam the whales' location, movements, dives and other information to researchers. However, the only occasion on which researchers have visually detected a right whale and been able to attach a satellite tag was on the 2006 NOAA research in the Bering Sea. However, of the \\_\\_\\_ tags deployed, \\_\\_\\_ failed within \\_\\_ days.\nOnly one tag worked, and it failed after 40 days, just as the whale was expected to start its southern migration. During that period the whale moved throughout a large part of the shelf, including areas of the outer shelf where right whales have not been seen in decades.[28]\n\n\n[218] and 1997\u20132004.[69][219]\n\n\nThere may be locations in the Sea of Okhotsk where right whales can reliably be found in summer. In the Sea of Okhotsk, the right whales are currently distributed far from shore in the southern part of the sea. The Sea is mainly Russian territorial waters, so Russian cooperation is required for any surveys. The remoteness of the location and the enormous demand for ships and aircraft associated with oil and gas exploration near Sakhalin Island, make any ship or aerial surveys difficult and expensive.\n\n\n\n### International law[edit]\n\n\nAfter World War I, the major whaling nations of the time (Norway, Great Britain, United States) became increasingly concerned the depletion of blue whales and other whale species, and entered into first international whaling treaty in 1931, the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling which became effective in 1935 after ratification by the member nations. The treaty banned the hunting of all right whales. However, Japan and the Soviet Union did not ratify the treaty, and thus were not bound by it. Attempts to bring the other major whaling nations under an international regime stalled until after World War II.[220]\n\n\nIn 1946 the major whaling countries signed the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling which established the International Whaling Commission (IWC) whose regulations first took effect in 1949. Since its inception, the IWC has banned the commercial hunting of right whales. Currently, the IWC classifies *E. japonica* a \"Protection Stock\" which bars commercial whaling.[221]\n\n\nHowever, the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling explicitly allows member countries to issue permits to their own citizens kills whales for scientific research, even if that species is otherwise protected from commercial hunts.[222] In 1955, the Soviet Union granted it whalers permits to kill 10 North Pacific right whales, and in 1956 and 1958 the Japanese granted permits to its whalers to kill 13 North Pacific right whales. The member nation issuing the scientific permit must report these permits to the International Whaling Commission. The 23 North Pacific right whales taken pursuant to these permits provide much of published morphology and reproductive biology data for this species. No further scientific whaling permits have been issued by any country to take North Pacific right whales.[220]\n\n\nDuring the 1960s, the IWC did not place observers on whaling ships. Whaling nations were expected to monitor their own whalers. The Soviet Union abused this process, directing its whalers to capture thousands of protected blue whales, humpback whales and right whales around the world. The Soviet Union's massive illegal whaling of North Pacific right whales is described in the discussion on historic whaling. The IWC did not require the Soviet Union (and other member nations) to have foreign observers on their ships until 1972, at which time the Soviet Union entered into agreement with Japan for Japanese observers on Soviet whaling ships.[223]\n\n\nUnder the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) all right whales (*Eubalaena* spp.) are listed in Appendix I[224] which bans all international commercial trade of parts or products of right whale species.\n\n\nUnder the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) the North Pacific right whale is listed on Appendix I[225] (CMS) as this species has been categorized as being in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant proportion of their range and CMS Parties strive towards strictly protecting these animals, conserving or restoring the places where they live, mitigating obstacles to migration and controlling other factors that might endanger them.\n\n\n\n### United States laws and regulations[edit]\n\n\nActions involving the North Pacific right whale are subject to three separate laws. First, the Whaling Convention Act of 1949[226] authorizes the federal government to adopt regulations that mirror the regulations (the \"Schedule\") adopted by the International Whaling Commission, including the IWC's ban on the commercial take of any right whales.\n\n\nSecond, the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) gives jurisdiction for management of all whale species to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the Department of Commerce. NOAA determined that the North Pacific right whale is currently \"depleted\" as that term is used in the act in 1973. Such classification affords the species various protections under the MMPA.\n\n\nThird, under the Endangered Species Act, NOAA has listed the North Pacific right whale as \"endangered\".[227] This law provides the species with additional protections which overlap those of the MMPA, but generally are more protective.\n\n\n\n#### Critical habitat[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Critical habitat for *E. japonica*\nThe Endangered Species Act directs the managing agencies, in this case NOAA, to designate portions of oceans as \"Critical Habitat\" which triggers specific protective measures.\nOn October 4, 2000, the Center for Biological Diversity (CBD) petitioned NMFS to designate the southeast Bering Sea shelf from 55 to 60\u00b0N as critical habitat for *E. japonica*. On February 20, 2002, NMFS declined (67 FR 7660) at that time, arguing that available information was insufficient for such a finding. CBD challenged NMFS in court, and in June 2005, a federal judge directed the agency to make a designation. In 2006, NMFS complied, designating one in the Gulf of Alaska south of Kodiak Island and one in the southeast Bering Sea (71 FR 38277, July 6, 2006). Later, NMFS split the \"northern right whale\" into *E. glacialis* and *E. japonica*, and reissued its rule.[228][229]\n\n\nCritical habitats must contain one or more \"primary constituent elements\" (PCEs) that are essential to the conservation of the species.[230] NMFS identified as PCEs: species of large zooplankton in right whale feeding areas, in particular the copepods *Calanus marshallae*, *Neocalanus cristatus*, and *Thysanoessa raschii* whose high lipid content and occurrence make them preferred prey items.,[231] and physical concentrating mechanisms, physical and biological features that aggregate prey into densities high enough to support efficient feeding.[232]\n\n\nNMFS simply used repeated right whale sightings in the same small area in spring and summer as a proxy for the presumed PCEs.\n\n\nThese areas support extensive and multi-species commercial fisheries for pollock, flatfish, cod, various crabs and other resources (but not salmon). NMFS ruled that these fisheries do not threaten PCE availability. NMFS also ruled that the zooplankton PCE was vulnerable to oil spills and discharges, which may require measures such as conditioning federal permits or authorizations with special operational constraints.[232]\n\n\nOnce a critical habitat has been designated, federal agencies must consult with NOAA to ensure that any action they authorize, fund or carry out is unlikely to destroy or adversely modify it.\n\n\nOn March 10, 2022, the Center for Biological Diversity filed with the NMFS a \"Petition to Revise the Critical Habitat Designation for the North Pacific Right Whale (*Eubalaena japonica*) Under the Endangered Species Act\", urged expansion of the critical habitat designation to \"a migratory corridor through the Fox Islands in the Aleutian chain, including Unimak Pass, and feeding grounds near Kodiak Island.[233]\n\n\n\n#### Recovery Plan[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2013, NOAA issued a formal \"Recovery Plan for the North Pacific Right Whale\" pursuant to the Endangered Species Act.[188] The Recovery Plan describes the current state of scientific knowledge of the species and the threats to its continued survival. The Plan also contains proposed conservation measures, which mainly consist of various research proposals including passive acoustic monitoring, satellite tagging, and review of historic whaling logbooks.\n\n\n\n### Canadian regulation[edit]\n\n\nIn Canada, some right whales had been caught in the early 20th century from whaling stations off northern Vancouver Island. There had been no sightings of right whales in Canadian waters since the large illegal Soviet kill in the 1960s with two exceptions of a pair confirmed off Haida Gwaii at 50\u00b000\u2032N 130\u00b00\u2032W\ufeff / \ufeff50.000\u00b0N 130.000\u00b0W\ufeff / 50.000; -130.000 \u2013 55\u00b000\u2032N 140\u00b00\u2032W\ufeff / \ufeff55.000\u00b0N 140.000\u00b0W\ufeff / 55.000; -140.000 in 1970[234] and two large whales seen on Swiftsure Bank off Strait of Juan de Fuca in 1983 though their species was unconfirmed.[170] There were no officially-confirmed records until the sighting of a single right whale on June 9 and 13, 2013, south of Langara Island at the north end of the Queen Charlotte Islands (Haida Gwaii), in British Columbia (~ 54\u00b0N, 132\u00b0W)[235][236] followed by the second sighting of a different individual at the mouth of the Strait of Juan de Fuca four months later.[237][238] Furthermore, a possible right whale was observed by a naturalist at the milepost 8 nearby Kydaka Point in October, 2014.[239]\n\n\nIn 2003, Fisheries and Oceans Canada issued a National Recovery Strategy for *E. japonica* in Pacific Canadian Waters.[240] In 2012, Fisheries and Oceans Canada issued an analysis of critical habitat for North Pacific right whales, and blue, fin and sei whales in British Columbia.[241] In 2013, Fisheries and Oceans Canada issued a \"Draft Partial Action Plan for Blue, Fin, Sei and North Pacific Right Whales (*Balaenoptera musculus*, *B. physalus*, *B. borealis*, and *Eubalaena japonica*) in Pacific Canadian Waters\".[242]\n\n\n\n## History of whaling[edit]\n\n\n### Whaling before 1835[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A portrait illustrating typical net-whaling industry of Taiji in Japan\nIn Japan, hunting for right whales dates back at least to the 16th century, although stranded whales had been used for centuries before then. In 1675, Yoriharu Wada invented a new method of whaling, entangling the animals in nets before harpooning them. Initially the nets were made of straw, later replaced by the stronger hemp. A hunting group consisted of 15\u201320 *Seko-bune* or \"beater\" boats, 6 *Ami-bune* or netting boats and 4 *Mosso-bune* or tug boats, for a total of 30\u201335 boats with crews totaling about 400. In addition to right whales, they took gray whales and humpback whales.[101]\n\n\n\n![](image)Miyamoto Musashi plunges his sword into a giant whale, from a 19th-century print by Utagawa Kuniyoshi. Its markings clearly identify it as a North Pacific right whale.\nHunts took place in two regions: the south coast (modern Mie, Wakayama and K\u014dchi Prefectures) on the east coasts, and the waters north of the prefectures from Kyoto to Yamaguchi and to the west of Ky\u016bsh\u016b which hunted in the Sea of Japan. Off the south coast of Japan, hunting lasted from winter to spring. Catches in K\u014dchi Prefecture between 1800 and 1835 totaled 259 whales. Catches at Ine on the Sea of Japan during the period 1700\u20131850 averaged less than 1 per year. Catches at Kawaijiri also on the Sea of Japan averaged 2 per year from 1699 to 1818.[101]\n\n\nA few Native American tribes hunted in the North Pacific. Their catches were much lower than the Japanese. The Inuit along the western and northwestern coasts of Alaska have hunted whales for centuries. They prefer the bowhead whale, and occasionally the gray whale. They hunted at or beyond the northern limits of the right whale's range.\n\n\nAleuts hunted *E. japonica* and Gray whales along the Aleutian Islands and the Alaska peninsula, using poisoned harpoons. The catch was not recorded, but is unlikely to have been more than a few per year.[18][243]\n\n\nThe Nootka, Makah, Quilleute and Auinault tribes of Vancouver Island and the coast of Washington were also skilled whalers of the gray and humpback whales. Right whales were rare in their catches.[18]\n\n\nThe North Pacific was the furthest whaling ground from New England and Europe markets. During the open-boat whaling era, the mainly American ships hunted in the nearest ranges first. As the fleet grew, boats spread to the eastern North Atlantic and, by the 1770s, the South Atlantic. Following the lead of the British, American vessels first sailed the South Pacific in 1791, and by the end of the decade had reached the eastern North Pacific. By the 1820s, the whalers had started to use Lahaina, Hawaii, as a base for hunting sperm whales.\n\n\n\n### Pelagic: 1835\u20131850[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Whalers retrieving the baleen (\"whalebone\") from a right whale (NOAA photo library)\nIn 1835, the French whaleship *Gange* ventured north of 50\u00b0N and became the first pelagic whaling ship to catch a North Pacific right whale. News of this find spread quickly. Whaleships north of 50\u00b0 increased from 2 in 1839 to 108 in 1843 and to 292 in 1846. Approximately 90% of the whaleships were American, the remainder primarily French.[64][244]\n\n\nThe focus of the North Pacific whaling fleet on right whales ended soon after 1848, when a whaler ventured through the Bering Straits and discovered unexploited populations of bowhead whales. Being more abundant, easier to capture, and yielding far more baleen, the majority of whalers rapidly switched to hunting bowheads. Since bowheads range further north than right whales, hunting pressure on right whales declined rapidly.[244]\n\n\nThe estimated total catch in the fishery in the Gulf of Alaska, Bering Sea, North Pacific and Sea of Okhotsk was 26,500\u201337,000 right whales between 1839 and 1909. Eighty percent of this catch was concentrated in the single decade of 1840\u201349.[21]\n\n\n\n### Industrial: 1850\u20131930s[edit]\n\n\nIn the decade between 1850 and 1859, the catch dropped to 3,000\u20134,000 animals, one-sixth the previous level. Between 1860 and 1870, it dropped to 1,000 animals. By the end of the 19th century, pelagic whalers averaged less than 10 right whales per year.[21]\n\n\nIn the late 19th century, steam propulsion and the explosive harpoon opened up new whaling opportunities. Species previously too swift to hunt commercially could now be caught\u2014blue and fin whales. Small coastal whaling operations opened in California, Oregon, and Washington, British Columbia, and in the Aleutian Islands and in southeast Alaska, and in the Kuril Islands in the west. Whalers hunted by day, towing their catch to shore for flensing, operating in a fairly small area around the whaling stations. Although they weren't the primary targets, a few right whales were recorded in catches from these stations.[13][18][53][244] A close-up photo of a North Pacific right whale taken at the Kyuquot whaling station, British Columbia in 1918 can be seen here.[245]\n\n\n\n### After the official protection[edit]\n\n\nThe later \"factory ships\" that processed carcasses while at sea further transformed pelagic whaling. Right whales continued to be taken, although uncommonly due to their rarity. Japan continued hunting right whales through the beginning of World War II. Afterward, General Douglas MacArthur, head of Allied occupation forces, encouraged the Japanese to resume whaling to feed their hungry population. Japan then joined the International Whaling Commission which barred the hunting of right whales. Except for 13 killed under \"scientific permits\", in accordance with IWC rules, Japanese whalers have honored this prohibition.\n\n\n\n![](image)Skeleton of the Kumomi specimen\nPossibly, several hundred whales (mostly unreported or unrecorded) were taken by Japanese until the late-1970s, including mass captures off southeastern Hokkaido and off Akkeshi.[53] In 1977, one of a pair firstly sighted at beaches in Numadu was driven into port of Kumomi next day and was killed[246] (although majority of medias even the museum itself claim that people tried their best to save the whale who stranded him/herself). A local museum (\u96f2\u898b\u304f\u3058\u3089\u9928) was later built specially for displaying the animal's carcass.[247][248] In the late 1970s, at least two cow-calf pairs were confirmed during cetacean surveys by Institute of Cetacean Research in very nearby area of Suruga Bay and off Bentenjima Island in Enshunada Sea, and another whale was observed in exactly the same area (Kumomi) in 1996 as well.[246]\n\n\nIn the 1970s, four right whales were taken by Chinese (or actually by Japanese)[249] and Korean whalers.[250][251][252] At least two whales were taken off Haiyang in the Yellow Sea in by Japanese whalers in 1944, and another pair was also taken by Japanese whalers in north of the island in January 1973 where both of these were later made to be specimen where smaller specimen became the only specimen (with skins and baleens) of the species in the world at the Dalian Natural History Museum,[253] and the larger individual is now on the Zhejiang Museum of Natural History.[254] reaching around 16\u201317.1m, and were later made to be specimens for exhibition at several locations.[255] Last record of the species in the nation was of a single whale being killed in the south of Haiyang Island in December 1977.[256] There have been none of confirmed records along Chinese coasts targeting right whales since after the last catch (or a sighting) in 1977.[53] For the catches in the Yellow Sea, P Wang, the same researcher who reported the catch in December 1977 off Haiyang Island in the Yellow Sea mentioned that it was possibly the same record as one in 1944 by Japanese whalers.[64] Many of these captured individuals were rather large individuals as reaching around 16\u00a0m (52.5\u00a0ft), and were later made to be specimens for exhibition at several locations.[257] There have also been an unknown number of modern catches off Taiwan as well.[131]\n\n\nWorld's last catch records of the species were claimed to be two catches by Japanese whalers in the Yellow Sea in 1994.[131]\n\n\n\n### Illegal Soviet whaling: 1962\u20131968[edit]\n\n\nHistorically, compliance with fisheries regulations regarding species caught and amount of the catch could be monitored when the fishing vessel returned to port, but with whaling factory ships, the whales were processed at sea, and the resulting products from all the baleen whales (whale oil, meat) were combined into a single commodity by the time the whaling ship reached port. As a consequence, a whaling operation that caught a protected right whale could cover up this infraction by combining the meat and oil with that from legal catches and misreporting it as a legal catch of a fin or several minke whales which would yield the same amount of product. Before DNA analysis of meat products became available very recently, such infractions could not be detected when the factory ship returned to port.\n\n\nAt the time, the only way to monitor compliance was by having whaling \"inspectors\" on the factory ships themselves to record the species and size of whales caught. When the International Whaling Commission (IWC) was established in 1946, monitoring of compliance with and enforcement of the IWC's regulations was the responsibility of each member nation with respect to its nationals' whaling operations. Each nation employed its own whaling inspectors at whaling stations and aboard whaling factory ships. Each member nation of the IWC was required to report to the IWC annually on compliance, describing the specifics of any infractions (e.g. number of illegal whales caught of which species), and what actions the member nation had taken regarding these infractions. The IWC itself has no legal authority to monitor whaling operations or impose sanctions on whaling operations for infractions. This policing of the whaling fleets by their own governments persisted until 1972 when the IWC established a system of international observers on whaling ships.[220]\n\n\nIn the 1960s, Soviet whalers had no international observers on board, and no conservation groups following them at sea. By 1962, humpback, blue and fin whales were getting harder to find in the North Pacific, and the Soviet whalers, under great pressure from their own government to meet production targets, deliberately chose to hunt right whales, apparently killing every right whale they could over the next eight years, in the North Pacific and also the southern oceans.[258] The Soviet government then filed fraudulent reports with the Bureau of International Whaling Statistics and the International Whaling Commission, admitting killing during this period only one right whale, by accident.\n\n\nThese Soviet infractions remained a state secret for four decades. In many instances, the Russian biologists who had been on the whaling ships were prohibited from examining the carcasses or taking any biological measurements of these whales. Nevertheless, several biologists kept their own records of what the whalers caught, then kept these records secret. After the collapse of the Soviet government, the new Russian government released at least part of the data on the true catch data.[53]\n\n\nIn 2006, former Soviet whale biologist Nikolai Doroshenko published records of 372 right whales caught by the Soviet whaling fleets *Vladivostok* and *Dalnij Vostok* in the Bering Sea and eastern North Pacific between 1963 and 1968. He also documented an additional 126 right whales killed in the Sea of Okhotsk between 1963 and 1968 and another 10 in the Kuril Islands in 1971.[212]\n\n\nDoroshenko did not have information regarding catches by a third Soviet whaling fleet, the *Sovetskaya Rossiya*, operating in the Gulf of Alaska in 1962\u20131963 that caught 142 right whales that were additional to the 372 previously revealed. Of the whales killed by the *Sovetskaya Rossiya* fleet, 112 were killed in June 1963 in the central and northern Gulf of Alaska.[16]\n\n\nIn 2012, newly discovered documents revealed that the total illegal catch was even larger. The accounting based on that information showed that the Soviet whaling fleets caught 529 right whales from 1962 to 1968 in the eastern North Pacific, plus 152 more right whales in the Sea of Okhotsk in 1967 and 1968, for a total of 661 right whales. Catches were distributed in the Bering Sea (115), eastern Aleutian Islands (28), Gulf of Alaska (366), Sea of Okhotsk (132), and other areas (20). Detailed information on catches of 112 right whales taken in May/June 1963 shows a broad distribution in offshore waters of the Gulf of Alaska, consistent with 19th century historical whaling records. Other major areas in which right whales were caught include south of Kodiak Island, western Bristol Bay (southeastern Bering Sea), and the central Sea of Okhotsk off eastern Sakhalin Island. The catches primarily involved large mature animals, thus greatly inhibiting recovery of right whales in these regions.[5]\n\n\nSince that 2012 accounting for illegally caught whales was published, the principle analyst for that study has increased her estimate of the total North Pacific right whales caught by the Soviet whalers in the North Pacific and Sea of Okhotsk from 661 whales to a new total of 765 whales, but details of the distribution of those additional whales is not yet published.[6]\n\n\nIt was also revealed that Japan was in fact 'helping' this destructive hunt in terms of neglecting and disregarding monitoring obligations and there were agreements between Japan and Soviet to keep their illegal mass whaling activities in foreign/international protected waters in confidentiality.[259]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Cetaceans portal\n* ![icon](image)Mammals portal\n* ![](image)Marine life portal\n\n\n* List of cetaceans\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Mead, J.

Southern right whales inhabit oceans south of the Equator, between the latitudes of 20\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 south.[5] In 2009 the global population was estimated to be approximately 13,600.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## Taxonomy[edit]\n\n\nRight whales were first classified in the genus *Balaena* in 1758 by Carl Linnaeus, who at the time considered all right whales (including the bowhead) to be a single species. In the 19th and 20th centuries the family Balaenidae was the subject of great taxonometric debate. Authorities have repeatedly recategorised the three populations of right whale plus the bowhead whale, as one, two, three or four species, either in a single genus or in two separate genera. In the early whaling days, they were all thought to be a single species, *Balaena mysticetus*.[7]\n\n\nThe southern right whale was initially described as *Balaena australis* by Desmoulins in 1822. Eventually, it was recognised that bowheads and right whales were different, and John Edward Gray proposed the genus *Eubalaena* for the right whale in 1864. Later, morphological factors such as differences in the skull shape of northern and southern right whales indicated at least two species of right whale\u2014one in the Northern Hemisphere, the other in the Southern Ocean.[7] As recently as 1998, Rice, in his comprehensive and otherwise authoritative classification, *Marine mammals of the world: systematics and distribution*, listed just two species: *Balaena glacialis* (all of the right whales) and *Balaena mysticetus* (the bowheads).[8]\n\n\nIn 2000, Rosenbaum et al. disagreed, based on data from their genetic study of DNA samples from each of the whale populations. Genetic evidence now shows that the northern and southern populations of right whale have not interbred for between 3\u00a0million and 12\u00a0million years, confirming the southern right whale as a distinct species. The northern Pacific and Atlantic populations are also distinct, with the North Pacific right whale being more closely related to the southern right whale than to the North Atlantic right whale.[9] Genetic differences between *E. japonica* (North Pacific) and *E. australis* (South Pacific) are much smaller than other baleen whales represent among different ocean basins.[10]\n\n\nIt is believed that the right whale populations first split because of the joining of North and South America. The rising temperatures at the equator then created a second split, into the northern and southern groups, preventing them from interbreeding.[11]\n\n\nIn 2002, the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) accepted Rosenbaum's findings, and recommended that the *Eubalaena* nomenclature be retained for this genus.[12]\n\n\nThe cladogram is a tool for visualising and comparing the evolutionary relationships between taxa. The point where a node branches off is analogous to an evolutionary branching \u2013 the diagram can be read left-to-right, much like a timeline. The following cladogram of the family Balaenidae serves to illustrate the current scientific consensus as to the relationships between the southern right whale and the other members of its family.\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Family Balaenidae\n |\n| |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \u00a0Family\u00a0Balaenidae | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| *Eubalaena*\u00a0(right\u00a0whales)\u00a0\u00a0\n | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | \u00a0*E. glacialis* North Atlantic right whale\n |\n|  |\n|  | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | \u00a0*E. japonica* North Pacific right whale\n |\n|  |\n|  | \u00a0***E. australis* southern right whale**\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n| *Balaena*\u00a0(bowhead\u00a0whales)\u00a0\n | \u00a0*B. mysticetus* bowhead whale\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n| The right whale family, Balaenidae[9] |\n\n\nOther junior synonyms for *E. australis* have included *B. antarctica* (Lesson, 1828), *B. antipodarum* (Gray, 1843), *Hunterus temminckii* (Gray, 1864), and *E. glacialis australis* (Tomilin, 1962) (see side panel for more synonyms).[1][4]\n\n\n\n## Description[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Two distinctive colouration patterns\nLike other right whales, the southern right whale is readily distinguished from others by the callosities on its head, a broad back without a dorsal fin, and a long arching mouth that begins above the eye. Its skin is very dark grey or black, occasionally with some white patches on the belly. The right whale's callosities appear white due to large colonies of cyamids (whale lice). It is almost indistinguishable from the closely related North Atlantic and the North Pacific right whales, displaying only minor skull differences. It may have fewer callosities on its head than North Atlantic and more on its lower lips than the two northern species.[7][13] The biological functions of callosities are unclear, although protection against predators has been put forward as the primal role.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAn adult female is 15\u00a0m (49\u00a0ft)[14] and can weigh up to 47 tonnes (46 long tons; 52 short tons),[14] with the larger records of 17.5\u201318\u00a0m (57\u201359\u00a0ft)[15][16] in length and 80 tonnes (79 long tons; 88 short tons)[17] or up to 90 tonnes (89 long tons; 99 short tons) in weight,[18] making them slightly smaller than other right whales in the Northern Hemisphere.[19] The testicles of right whales are likely to be the largest of any animal, each weighing around 500\u00a0kg (1,100\u00a0lb). This suggests that sperm competition is important in the mating process.[20]\n\n\nThe proportion and numbers of molten-coloured individuals are notable in this species compared with the other species in the Northern Hemisphere. Some whales remain white even after growing up.[21]\n\n\nLife span is not clear although whales seem to reach over 100 years old.[22]\n\n\n\n## Behaviour[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Whale surfacing behaviour\n\n![](image)Surfacing behaviour ![](image)\"Sailing\"\nLike other right whales, they are rather active on the water surface and curious towards human vessels. Southern rights appear to be more active and tend to interact with humans more than the other two northern species.[*citation needed*] One behaviour unique to the southern right whale, known as *tail sailing*, is that of using their elevated flukes to catch the wind, remaining in the same position for a considerable amount of time. It appears to be a form of play and is most commonly seen off the coast of Argentina and South Africa.[13] Some other species such as humpback whales are also known to display. Right whales are often seen interacting with other cetaceans, especially humpback whales[23] and dolphins. There have been records of southern rights and humpbacks thought to be involved in mating activities off Mozambique,[24] and along Bahia, Brazil.[25]\n\n\nOn several occasions, calving mothers have been recorded to nurse non-offspring calves along with their own calves.[26] Additionally, a female was seen to accompany a lone humpback whale calf although the actual relationship of this pair is unclear.[27]\n\n\n\n### Reproduction[edit]\n\n\nSouthern right whales display strong maternal fidelity to their calving grounds.[28][29] Calving females are known to return to calving grounds at 3-year intervals.[30] The most commonly observed calving interval is 3 years, but intervals can range from 2 to 21 years.[31][32] Calving takes place between June and November[33] in calving grounds between 20 and 30\u00b0 S.[34]\n\n\nIn Australia, southern right whales have shown a preference for calving grounds along coastlines with high wave energy, such as the Head of the Bight. Here, the sound of breaking waves may mask the sound of the whales' presence, and so protect infants and calving cows from predators such as killer whales. Deep waters alongside shallower calving grounds may serve as training grounds for calves to build up their stamina ahead of migration.[35]\n\n\nFemales give birth to their first calf when they are between eight and ten years old.[36] A single calf is born after a gestation period of one year, about 1 short ton (0.91\u00a0t) in weight and 4\u20136\u00a0m (13\u201320\u00a0ft) in length.[37] The calf usually remains with its mother during the first year of its life, during which time it will double in length.[5]\n\n\nThis species has been recognized to nurse unrelated orphans on occasions.[38]\n\n\n\n### Feeding[edit]\n\n\nLike right whales in other oceans, southern right whales feed almost exclusively on zooplankton, particularly krill.[5] They feed just beneath the water's surface, holding their mouths partly open and skimming water continuously while swimming. They strain the water out through their long baleen plates to capture their prey. A southern right whale's baleen can measure up to 2.8\u00a0m (9\u00a0ft 2\u00a0in) long, and is made up of 220-260 baleen plates.[33]\n\n\n\n## Population and distribution[edit]\n\n\nThe global population of southern right whales was estimated at 13,611 in 2009.[6] An estimate published by National Geographic in October 2008 put the southern whale population at 10,000. An estimate of 7,000 followed a March 1998 IWC workshop. Researchers used data about adult female populations from three surveys (one in each of Argentina, South Africa and Australia, collected during the 1990s) and extrapolated to include unsurveyed areas, number of males and calves using available male:female and adult:calf ratios to give an estimated 1999 figure of 7,500 animals.[39] Recovery of the overall population size of the species is predicted to be at less than 50% of its pre-whaling state by 2100 due to heavier impacts of whaling and slower recovery rates.[40] Since hunting ceased, the population is estimated to have grown by 7% a year.\n\n\nThe southern right whale spends summer in the far Southern Ocean feeding, probably close to Antarctica. If the opportunity arises, feeding can occur even in temperate waters such as along Buenos Aires.[41][42] It migrates north in winter for breeding and can be seen by the coasts of Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, Namibia, Mozambique, Peru, Tristan de Cunha, Uruguay, Madagascar, New Zealand and South Africa; whales have also been known to winter in sub-Antarctic regions.[43][44] It appears that the South American, South African and Australasian groups intermix very little if at all, because maternal fidelity to feeding and calving habitats is very strong. The mother also passes these choices to her calves.[45]\n\n\nRight whales do not normally cross the warm equatorial waters to connect with the other species and (inter)breed: their thick layers of insulating blubber make it difficult for them to dissipate their internal body heat in tropical waters. Based on historical records and unconfirmed sightings in modern periods, *E. australis* transits may sometimes occur through equatorial waters.[46]\n\n\nWhaling records for the hemisphere include a whaling ground in the central northern Indian Ocean[47] and recent sightings among near-equatorial regions. If the sighting off Kiribati was truly of *E. australis*, this species may have crossed the Equator on irregular occasions and their original distributions might have been much broader and more northerly distributed than is currently believed.[46][48] A stranding of a 21.3 m (71 feet) right whale at Gajana, northwestern India in November 1944 was reported, but the true identity of this animal is unclear.[49][50]\n\n\nAside from impacts on whales and environments caused by mankind, their distributions and residences could be largely affected by presences of natural predators or enemies,[43] and similar trends are also probable for other subspecies.[51]\n\n\nMany locations throughout the Southern Hemisphere were named after current or former presences of southern rights, including Walvis Bay, Punta Ballena, Right Whale Bay, Otago Harbour, Whangarei Harbour, Foveaux Strait,[52] South Taranaki Bight, Moutohora Island and Wineglass Bay.\n\n\n\n### Africa[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Breaching in the De Hoop Nature Reserve\nA mating group in Hermanus Bay: one female and two males\n#### South Africa[edit]\n\n\nHermanus in South Africa has become known as a centre for whale watching. During the Southern Hemisphere winter months (June \u2013 October) the southern right whales migrate to the coastal waters of South Africa, with more than 100 whales known to visit the Hermanus area. Whilst in the area, the whales can be seen with their young as they come to Walker Bay to calve and mate. Many behaviours such as breaching, sailing, lobtailing, or spyhopping can be witnessed. In False Bay whales can be seen from the shore from July to October while both Plettenberg Bay and Algoa Bay are also home to the southern right whales from July to December. They can be viewed from land as well as by boat with licensed operators conducting ocean safaris throughout the year.\n\n\n\n![](image)Mother and calf in Hermanus\nRecent increases in numbers of whales visiting the north-eastern part of South Africa, the so-called Dolphin Coast such as around Ballito[53] and off Umdloti Beach,[54] indicates the whales' normal ranges are expanding and that re-colonising historical habitats will likely continue as more whales migrate further north.\n\n\n\n#### Western Africa[edit]\n\n\nIn Namibia, the majority of confirmed whales are restricted to the south of Luderitz, on the southwestern coast. Only a handful of animals venture further north to historical breeding grounds such as at Walvis Bay, but their numbers are slowly increasing. Until illegal hunting ceased, whales were rare along Namibian shores, with no sighting recorded north of Orange River until 1971.[55] Calving activities were first confirmed as recently as the 1980s.[56]\n\n\nHistorical records suggest that this whale's regular range could have once reached further northwards up the coasts of Cape Fria (northern Namibia)[57] and Angola as far as Baia dos Tigres (Tiger Bay).[58][57]\n\n\nWhaling is known to have been carried out off the coast of Gabon,[46] for example at Cape Lopez, and there have been a few confirmed and unconfirmed sightings including one by Jim Darling, a renowned whale researcher.[59][60][61]\n\n\n\n#### Eastern Africa[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rare appearance along Madagascar at \u00cele Sainte-Marie\nSouthern right whales have been spotted in very small numbers off Mozambique[62] and Madagascar.[63] Whales were historically seen in large numbers at various locations such as off the coast of Durban, in Delagoa/Maputo Bay,[64] Inhaca Island, Ponta do Ouro, and around the Bazaruto Archipelago.[24] The first sighting off Mozambique since the end of whaling was in 1997.[65] In recent years, more whales seem to migrate further north to calve, such as at \u00cele Sainte-Marie,[66][67][68][69] Antongil Bay,[60] Fort Dauphin[70] Toliara,[71] Anakao, Andavadoaka, and Antsiranana Bay,[72][73][74] at Madagascar's northern tip. Infrequent sightings have been confirmed off the island of Mayotte.[75] Whales were historically taken off the coast of Tanzania, and may still be present occasionally around Zanzibar.[76]\n\n\n\n#### Mid\u2013South Atlantic[edit]\n\n\nDue to illegal whaling by the USSR, the recovery of many stocks including the population off Tristan da Cunha[77] and adjacent areas such as Gough Island has been severely hindered, resulting in relatively few numbers of visiting animals.\n\n\nBased on catch records and recent observations, right whales may be seen as far north as the islands of Saint Helena and Ascension Island.[48][78]\n\n\n\n### South America[edit]\n\n\n#### Brazil[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cow \u2013 calf pair at Abrolhos\nIn Brazil, more than 300 individuals have been cataloged through photo identification (using head callosities) by the Brazilian Right Whale Project, maintained jointly by Petrobras (the Brazilian state-owned oil company), and the conservation group, the International Wildlife Coalition. The State of Santa Catarina hosts a concentration of breeding and calving right whales from June to November, and females from this population also calve off Argentinian Patagonia and Uruguay. In recent years, possibly due to changing habitat environments by human activities and conflicts with local fisheries, the number of whales visiting the coasts is decreasing.[79] Sighting in locations other than Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul[80] remain sporadic, such as along Cidreira,[81] Rio de Janeiro coasts like Sepetiba Bay (pt),[82] Cabo Frio,[83][84] Maca\u00e9,[85] Prado, Bahia,[86][87] Castelhanos Bay in Ilha Bela,[88][89][90] S\u00e3o Paulo coasts[91] such as within Ilha Anchieta State Park,[92] Honey Island,[93][94][95] and bays and estuaries of Paranagu\u00e1 and Superagui National Park,[96] Paran\u00e1,[97][98][99] and even entering into the lagoon of Lagoa dos Patos.[100][101] Recent studies[102] also show a decrease in the number of sightings along the southeastern Brazilian coast, which includes the highly urbanized States of S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.\n\n\nFurther north, small numbers of whales migrate every year to winter or calve in Bahia,[25] in particular at the Abrolhos Archipelago. Here, certain individuals are recorded returning at intervals of 3 or 4 years.[103] Whaling records including those prior to Maury and Townsend indicate that right whales were once more frequent visitors further north, for example at Salvador, Bahia.[46][48]\n\n\n\n#### Argentina[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Submerges off Valdes Peninsula\nArgentina hosts the world's largest breeding population of southern right whales at Pen\u00ednsula Vald\u00e9s, Chubut province, with over 2000 estimated individuals gathering on the gulfs of the peninsula during breeding season. The whales are considered a \"natural monument\" and protected under Argentine law, and there is a developed whale-watching tourism around them.\n\n\nDuring the 2012 annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission's Scientific Committee, data was presented regarding the continued phenomenon of southern right whale strandings and high rate of mortality at Pen\u00ednsula Vald\u00e9s. Between 2003 and 2011, a total of 482 dead right whales were recorded at Pen\u00ednsula Vald\u00e9s. There were at least 55 whale deaths in 2010, and 61 in 2011. As in previous years, the vast majority of strandings were calves of the season.[104]\nThere have been increasing sightings in various other locations in recent years, such as on Golfo San Jorge,[105] Tierra del Fuego,[106][107] Puerto Deseado,[108][109] Mar del Plata,[110][111] Miramar, Buenos Aires,[112][113] and Bah\u00eda Blanca.[114]\n\n\n\n#### Uruguay[edit]\n\n\nIn Uruguay, coastal areas such as Punta del Este host congregating sites for whales in breeding seasons, but these are not likely to be calving grounds.[115] In 2013 the Uruguayan parliament approved the creation of a whale sanctuary off Latin America[116] to aid the recovery of the population. The creation of this protected area had been prevented for nearly a decade by pro-whaling nations such as Japan.\n\n\n\n#### Chile and Peru[edit]\n\n\nFor the critically endangered Chile/Peru population, the Cetacean Conservation Center (CCC) has been working on a separate programme for right whales. This population, containing no more than 50 individuals, is under threat from an increase in shipping lanes and the fishing industries.[117] 124 sightings in total were recorded during the period 1964\u20132008.[118] Aside from vagrants' records, Peru's coastlines possibly host one of the northernmost confirmed range of the species along with Gabon,[46] Senegal, Tanzania, Brazilian coasts, Madagascar, Indian Ocean, western Australia, Kermadec Islands, and tropical waters including South Pacific Islands.[46] The Alfaguara project targeting cetaceans in Chiloe[119][120] may possibly target this species as well in the future since calving activities have been confirmed in Chilo\u00e9 Archipelago.[121] Foraging grounds of this population is currently undetected, but possibly Chilo\u00e9 and down south of Caleta Zorra to southern fiords such as from Penas Gulf to Beagle Channel although numbers of confirmations are small in the Beagle Channel.[122] Hopes are arising for the establishment of a new tourism industry on the eastern side of the Strait of Magellan,[123] especially near Cape Virgenes[124] and Punta Dungeness, as the number of sightings increases.[125][126][127] It is unknown whether these increases are due to re-colonisation by whales from the Patagonian population.\n\n\nOccurrences of brindle individuals have been confirmed from this population as well.[128][129]\n\n\n\n### Oceania[edit]\n\n\nHistorically, populations of southern right whales in Oceanian regions were robust.[48] Early settlers of Wellington, New Zealand, and the River Derwent in Tasmania complained that sounds of cavorting whales kept them awake at night.[130] In July 1804, clergyman Robert Knopwood claimed that in crossing the River Derwent, \"we passed so many whales that it was dangerous for the boat to go up the river unless you kept very near the shore\".[131] \nBy the 1890s southern right whales had been brought to the brink of extinction, with over 25,000 whales killed in Australia and New Zealand.[132]\n\n\nStudies of population structure and mating systems have shown that the southwest Australian and New Zealand populations are genetically differentiated.[133] The results of satellite tracking suggest that there are at least some interactions between populations in Australia and New Zealand,[134][135] but the extent of this is unknown. The two groups may share migratory corridors and calving grounds.[133] The return of southern right whales to the Derwent River and other parts of Australia in recent decades is a sign that they are slowly recovering from their earlier exploitation to near extinction.[132]\n\n\n\n#### Australia[edit]\n\n\n![](image)In Lipson Cove, Spencer Gulf\nSouthern right whales in Australian waters show higher rate of recoveries, as they have increased from 2,100 whales in 2008[136] to 3,500 in 2010.[30] Two genetically distinct groups inhabit Australian waters: the southwestern population of 2,900 whales - in 2012 currently holding the majority of the overall Australian population - and the critically endangered southeastern group, counting only dozens to 300 individuals.\n\n\n\n##### South Australia[edit]\n\n\nRight whales can be found in many parts of southern Australia, where the largest population is found at the Head of the Bight in South Australia, a sparsely populated area south of the middle of the Nullarbor Plain. Over 100[137] individuals are seen there annually from June to October. Visitors can view the whales from cliff-top boardwalks and lookouts, with whales swimming almost directly below, or by taking a scenic flight over the marine park. A more accessible South Australian location for viewing whales is Encounter Bay where the whales can be seen just off the beaches of the Fleurieu Peninsula, centred around the surfing town of Middleton. The whales have established a newer nursery-ground near Eyre Peninsula, especially at Fowlers Bay. Numbers are much smaller at these locations compared to those in the Bight, with an average of a couple of whales per day, but as of 2009[update] there were regular sightings of more than ten whales at a time off Basham Beach, near Middleton.[138] The South Australian Whale Centre at Victor Harbor has information on the history of whaling and whale-watching in the area, and maintains an on-line database of whale sightings.[139]\nIn June 2021 a female gave birth off Christies Beach, a southern suburb of Adelaide, and remained in the shallows off the beach for some time, attracting large crowds.[140]\n\n\n\n##### Victoria and Tasmania[edit]\n\n\nWhale numbers are scarcer in Victoria, where the only established breeding ground which whales use each year, in very small numbers, is at Warrnambool. However, as the whales do seem to be increasing in number generally, but not showing any dramatic increases at Warrnambool, they may be extending their wintering habitats into other areas of Victoria, where the numbers of sightings are slowly increasing. These areas include around Melbourne, such as in Port Phillip Bay, along Waratah Bay, at Ocean Grove, Warrnambool, on Mornington Peninsula, in Apollo Bay, and on Gippsland coasts and at Wilsons Promontory.[141]\n\n\nWhale numbers in Tasmania are relatively small, however sightings have increased in recent years. Some whales migrate through Tasmanian waters while some others remain throughout wintering seasons.[142]\n\n\n\n##### Other states and territories[edit]\n\n\n![](image)In Waychinicup National Park\nWaters off the coasts of Western Australia, New South Wales, and Queensland coasts have all historically been inhabited by whales. Their historical range was much wider than it is today, and reached around the southern coast of the continent, extending up to Australian Abrolhos Island,[143] Exmouth and Shark Bay on the west coast, and on the east coast as far north as Hervey Bay, Moreton Bay[144] and Great Barrier Reef.[145] Today, the east-coast population remains endangered and very small (in the low-tens),[146] contributing to small numbers and limited re-colonization, but increases have been confirmed in many areas such as Port Jackson, Port Stephens, Twofold Bay, Jervis Bay, Broulee,[147] Moruya River,[148][149] Narooma,[150] and Byron Bay.[151] 12 foraging areas have been officially announced by the Australian government.[152]\n\n\nIn sub-Antarctic regions, numbers of whales visiting long-used habitats differ drastically by location. The population is recovering well at the New Zealand Subantarctic Islands, while whale numbers are less successful at Macquarie Island.[153]\n\n\nIt is not known whether Australian populations will re-colonise historical oceanic habitats such as Norfolk Island and Lord Howe Island with Lord Howe Seamount Chain (historically known as the \"Middle Ground\" for whalers[154][*need quotation to verify*][155])\nin the future.\n\n\n\n#### New Zealand[edit]\n\n\nThe current population of right whales in New Zealand waters is difficult to establish. However, studies by the Department of Conservation and sightings reported by locals have helped to build up a better picture.[156] The pre-exploitation size of the New Zealand group is estimated at between 28,800 and 47,100 whales. 35,000 \u2013 41,000 catches were made between 1827 and 1980. The number of whales surviving commercial and illegal whaling operations is estimated to have decreased to just 110 whales (around 30 of which were females) in 1915.[133][157] As a result of such a steep decline in numbers, the population of southern right whales in this region has experienced a population bottleneck and suffers from low genetic diversity.[158]\n\n\n\n![](image)In Port Ross, Auckland Islands\nThe population at the sub-Antarctic Auckland Islands is showing a remarkable recovery but continues to have some of the lowest genetic diversities in the world.[158] In the Campbell Islands, recovery is slower.[44] Here, the population is estimated to have dropped to as low as 20 individuals post WWII.[134] There had been no confirmed sightings or strandings of right whales for 36 years until 1963 when four separate sightings including a cow-calf pair were made over a wide area. Remnants of sub-Antarctic populations were reported in the 1980s and re-discovered in the 1990s.[134]\n\n\nToday, the majority of right whales congregate at the Auckland and Campbell Islands, where they form exceptionally dense and limited congregations including mating adults and calving females. In the waters around Port Ross[159] up to 200 whales may winter at the same time.[160] It is notable that whales of all age groups[161] are present in this small area annually, not only using them as feeding and summering[162] grounds but also for wintering, breeding, and calving during harsh, cold periods. Low genetic diversity as a result of population decline has caused changes in skin coloration amongst this group.[158]\nScientists used to believe there was a very small remnant population of southern right whales inhabiting New Zealand's main islands (North and South Island), estimated to contain 11 reproductive females.[163] In winter, whales migrate north to New Zealand waters and large concentrations occasionally visit the southern coasts of South Island. Bay areas along Foveaux Strait from Fiordland region to northern Otago are important breeding habitats for right whales, especially Preservation,[164] Chalky Inlets,[165] Te Waewae Bay,[166] and Otago Peninsula.[167][168] Calving activities are observed all around New Zealand, but with more regularity around North Island shores from the Taranaki coast in the west to Hawke's Bay, Bay of Plenty in the east, and areas in Hauraki Gulf such as Firth of Thames or Bay of Islands in the north.\n\n\nThere are various parts of the nation where large numbers of whales were seen historically, but sightings are less common nowadays. These areas include the Marlborough Region, especially from Clifford Bay and Cloudy Bay to Port Underwood,[169] Golden Bay, Awaroa Bay, and coastlines on West Coast and Hokianga Harbour in Northland. Other than a handful of confirmed observations, very little information is available for modern migrations to historical oceanic habitats of Kermadec Islands[170][171] and Chatham Islands.[172] The northernmost sighting recorded historically was at 27\u00b0S.[173]\n\n\nA 2009 study revealed that the right whale populations from New Zealand's main islands and the sub-Antarctic islands interbreed, though it is still unknown whether the two stock originally came from a single population.[174] Feeding areas in pelagic waters are unclear while congregations have been confirmed along the southern edge of the Chatham Rise.[175]\n\n\nSome Australian ranges are located close to the ranges of New Zealand groups (Norfolk Island, Macquarie Island). It is unclear whether whales historically or currently from these Australian ranges once originated in New Zealand groups.\n\n\n\n### Other[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fluking off South Georgia near a gentoo penguin\nIn oceanic islands and offshore waters other than the above-mentioned areas, very little about the presence and recovery status of southern right whales is known. Right whales' historical ranges were much greater than today; during the whaling era of the 19th century whales were known to occur in lower latitude areas such as around the Pacific Islands, off the Gilbert Islands (nowadays Kiribati),[176] and also to frequent lower latitudes of the central Indian Ocean.\n\n\nIt is unclear whether right whales have been historically or currently distributed among parts of hemisphere lacking great land masses and reached far more pelagic islands such as Alejandro Selkirk and Robinson Crusoe Islands, Hanga Roa, Pitcairn, Galapagos Islands, and the Easter Island.\n\n\nPopulations among sub-Antarctic islands in the Scotia Sea[80] such as South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands and Falkland Islands were severely damaged and show slower recoveries today. Antarctic distributions are difficult to establish due to low levels of sightings around oceanic islands in these areas, including Elephant Island.[a]\n\n\n\n#### Indian Ocean[edit]\n\n\nHistorically, there were known to be populations which summered in the Crozet Islands and the Kerguelen Islands, and migrated to La Roche Godon and \u00cele Saint-Paul, \u00cele Amsterdam, and the Central Indian Ocean. They may be distinct from the population of whales seen on Mozambique coasts.[177] Repopulation of whales among these areas of the Indian Ocean is likely to be happening at even lower rates than in other areas. Sightings have been fewer in modern periods among Crozet,[178][179] R\u00e9union,[180][64][181][182] Mauritius, Marion Islands,[43] \u00cele Amsterdam, and Kerguelen.[183]\n\n\nKillings of these whales have been recorded on central Indian Ocean near the equator, especially around the area between Diego Garcia, Egmont Islands, and the Great Chagos Bank in the west, and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands in the east. The range of whales in the Indian Ocean is comparable to the range of some other populations around South America, Africa, and the South Pacific islands including Kiribati, the northernmost reach of all the populations known today.[47]\n\n\n\n## Whaling[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sculpture of southern right whale at Cockle Creek on Recherche Bay, Tasmania, where bay whaling was performed extensively during the 1840s and 1850s\nMain article: History of whaling\n\nBy 1750 the North Atlantic right whale was as good as extinct for commercial purposes, and the American whalers moved into the South Atlantic before the end of the 18th century. The most southerly Brazilian whaling station was established in 1796, in Imbituba. Over the next hundred years, American whaling spread into the Southern and Pacific Oceans, where the American fleet was joined by fleets from several European nations.\n\n\nThe southern right whale had been coming to Australian and New Zealand waters in large numbers before the 19th century, but was extensively hunted from 1800 to 1850. Hunting gradually declined with the whale population and then all but ended in coastal waters in Australasia.[184] The beginning of the 20th century brought industrial whaling, and the catch grew rapidly. By 1937, according to whalers' records, 38,000 were harpooned in the South Atlantic, 39,000 in the South Pacific, and 1,300 in the Indian Ocean. Given the incompleteness of these records, the total take was somewhat higher.[185]\n\n\nAs it became clear that the population was nearly depleted, the harpooning of right whales was banned in 1937. The ban was largely successful, although some illegal whaling continued for several decades. Madeira took its last two right whales in 1968. Illegal whaling continued off the coast of Brazil for years, and the Imbituba station processed right whales until 1973. The USSR admitted to taking illegally over 3,300 during the 1950s and 1960s,[186] although it only reported taking 4.[187]\n\n\nIllegal operations continued even in the 1970s, such as the case in Brazil until 1973.[15] It was also revealed that Japan was supporting these destructive hunts by neglecting and disregarding its monitoring obligations. There were agreements between Japan and the Soviet Union to keep their illegal mass whaling activities in foreign/international protected waters secret.[188]\n\n\nRight whales began to be seen again in Australian and New Zealand waters from the early 1960s.[184] It is possible that if the Soviet hunts had never happened, the New Zealand population would be three or four times larger than its current size.[189]\n\n\n\n## Conservation[edit]\n\n\nThe southern right whale, listed as \"endangered\" by CITES, is protected by all countries with known breeding populations (Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, New Zealand, South Africa and Uruguay). In Argentina, it is considered a \"Natural Monument\" under national law N\u00ba 23094, with all whales sighted on Argentine waters under legal protection. In Brazil, a federal Environmental Protection Area encompassing some 1,560\u00a0km2 (600\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) and 130\u00a0km (81\u00a0mi) of coastline in Santa Catarina State was established in 2000 to protect the species' main breeding grounds in Brazil and promote regulated whale watching.[190] The southern right whale is listed on Appendix I[191] of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) as this species has been categorized as being in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant proportion of their range. This species is also covered by the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (Pacific Cetaceans MoU).[192] In 2017, the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species listed the species' status as Least Concern with a population trend listed as \"unknown\".[193]\n\n\nIn Australia, Southern right whales are listed for protection variously under state and federal legislation, as reflected in the table below:\n\n\n\n\n\nThreatened species listing status in Australia by jurisdiction\n| Jurisdiction\n | Status\n | Legislation\n | Year of last revision\n | Reference\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Australia\n | Endangered\n | EPBC Act 1999 | 2000\n | [194] |\n| Western Australia\n | Vulnerable\n | Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016\n |  | [195] |\n| South Australia\n | Vulnerable\n | National Parks & Wildlife Act 1972 |  | [196] |\n| Victoria\n | Threatened\n | Flora & Fauna Guarantee Act 1988\n |  | [197] |\n| Tasmania\n | Endangered\n | Threatened Species Protection Act 1995 |  | [198] |\n\n\nA two-year, \u00a3740,000 project, led by the British Antarctic Survey began in 2016, to discover why almost 500 young have been washed up on the Valdes Peninsula over the last ten years. The project is funded by the UK's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the EU. Possible reasons are a lack of krill in the whale feeding grounds at South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, exposure to toxic algae and attacks by kelp gulls (*Larus dominicanus*).[199]\n\n\n\n![](image)A white calf attacked by a gull off Pen\u00ednsula Vald\u00e9s\n### Gull attacks[edit]\n\n\nOne possibly significant contributor to the calf mortality rate has alarmed scientists \u2013 since at least 1996, kelp gulls off the coast of Patagonia have been observed attacking and feeding on live right whales.[200] The kelp gull uses its powerful beak to peck down several centimetres into the skin and blubber, often leaving the whales with large open sores \u2013 some of which have been observed to be half a metre in diameter. This predatory behaviour, primarily targeted towards mother/calf pairs, has been continually documented in Argentinian waters, and continues today. Observers note that the whales are spending up to a third of their time and energy performing evasive manoeuvres \u2013 therefore, mothers spend less time nursing, and the calves are thinner and weaker as a result. Researchers speculate that many years ago, waste from fish processing plants allowed the gull populations to soar. Their resulting overpopulation, combined with reduced waste output, caused the gulls to seek out this alternative food source.[201] Scientists fear that the gulls' learned behaviour could proliferate, and the IWC Scientific Committee has urged Brazil to consider taking immediate action if and when similar gull behaviour is observed in their waters. Such action may include the removal of attacking gulls, following Argentina's lead in attempting to reverse the trend.[104]\n\n\n\n### Threats[edit]\n\n\nSouthern right whales are threatened by entanglement in commercial fishing gear and ship strikes.[5] Entanglement in fishing gear can cut through a whale's skin, causing infection, amputation and death. Underwater noise from human activities such as drilling and dredging can interfere with whales' communication, and deter them from their usual habitats and breeding grounds.[202]\n\n\n\n## Whale watching[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Whale watching\n\n### Africa[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Addo Elephant National Park\n\n![](image)Whale breaching off George, Western Cape with a tanker behind\nThe southern right whale has made Hermanus, South Africa, one of the world centres for whale watching. During the winter months (June to October), southern right whales come so close to the shoreline that visitors can watch them from the shore as well as from strategically placed hotels. The town employs a \"whale crier\" (cf. town crier) to walk through the town announcing where whales have been seen.[203] Hermanus also has two boat\u2013based whale watching operators. Southern right whales can also be watched at False Bay from the shore or from the boats of operators in Simon's Town. Plettenberg Bay along the Garden Route of South Africa is also known for whale watching including both land and boat based watching, not only for southern rights (July to December) but throughout the year.[204] Southern right whales can also be seen off the coast of Port Elizabeth with marine eco tours running from the Port Elizabeth harbour, as some southern right whales make Algoa Bay their home for the winter months.[205]\n\n\nAlthough southern right whales have been seen in neighboring countries including Namibia, Mozambique, and Madagascar, they are not the targeted species for whale watching tours in these countries.\n\n\n\n### South America[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Southern right whale approaches close to whale watchers near Pen\u00ednsula Vald\u00e9s in Patagonia\nIn Brazil, Imbituba in Santa Catarina has been recognised as the National Right Whale Capital and holds annual Right Whale Week celebrations in September, when mothers and calves are more often seen. The old whaling station there is now a museum that documents the history of right whales in Brazil. In Argentina, Pen\u00ednsula Vald\u00e9s in Patagonia hosts (in winter) the largest breeding population, with more than 2,000 catalogued by the Whale Conservation Institute and Ocean Alliance.[206] As in the south of Argentina, the whales come within 200\u00a0m (660\u00a0ft) of the main beach in the city of Puerto Madryn and form a part of the large ecotourism industry. Uruguay's Parliament on 4 September 2013, has become the first country in the world to make all of its territorial waters a haven for whales and dolphins. Every year, dozens of whales are sighted, especially in the departments of Maldonado and Rocha during winter.[207] Swimming activities for commercial objectives had been banned in the area in 1985,[208] but were legalised in Gulf of San Mat\u00edas, the only place in the world where humans are formally allowed to swim with the species.[209] Land-based watching and occasional kayaking with whales activities are seen at other locations not renowned for whale-watching as much as Puerto Madryn and with less restrictions on approaching whales, such as at Puerto Deseado,[210][211][212] Mar del Plata,[213][214] and Miramar in Buenos Aires.[215][216][217][218]\n\n\nThough their numbers are dangerously small, land-based sightings of whales are on the increase in recent years off Chile and Peru, with some hope of creating new tourism industries,[219] especially in the Strait of Magellan, most notably around Cape Virgenes.[126]\n\n\n\n### Oceania[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Whales cavort next to surfers on Manly Beach.\nIn Australia's winter and spring, southern right whales can be seen migrating along the Great Australian Bight in South Australia. Viewing locations include the Bunda Cliffs and Twin Rocks, the Head of the Bight (where a visitor centre and cliff-top viewing boardwalks exist) and at Fowler's Bay where accommodation and charter boat tours are offered.[13] Another popular South Australian locality for Southern right whale watching is Encounter Bay, where the South Australian Whale Centre supports local whale-watchers and tourists. In Warrnambool, Victoria, a right whale nursery is also a popular tourist attraction. The whales' migratory range is extending as the species continues to recover and re-colonize other areas of the continent, including the coastal waters of New South Wales and Tasmania. In Tasmania, the first birth since the 19th century was recorded in 2010 in the River Derwent.\n\n\nSimilarly, southern right whales may provide chances for the public to observe whales from shore on New Zealand's coasts with greater regularity than in the past, especially in southern Fiordland, Southland through to the Otago coast,[220] and on the North Island coast, especially in Northland and other locations such as the Bay of Plenty and the South Taranaki Bight. Births of calves could have always been occurring on the main islands' coasts, but were confirmed with two cow-calf pairs in 2012.[221][222]\n\n\n\n### Subantarctic[edit]\n\n\nIn the Subantarctic Islands and in the vicinity of Antarctica,[223] where few regulations exist or are enforced, whales can be observed on expedition tours with increasing probability. The Auckland Islands are a specially designated sanctuary for right whales, where whale-watching tourism is prohibited without authorisation.[224]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Cetaceans portal\n* ![icon](image)Mammals portal\n* ![](image)Marine life portal\n\n\n* List of cetaceans\n* List of marine mammal species\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Not to be confused with Elephanta Island, Elephant Jason Island, or Elephantine Island\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Mead, J.

It is the second-longest species of cetacean on Earth after the blue whale.[8] The largest reportedly grow to 27.3\u00a0m (89.6\u00a0ft) long[9] with a maximum confirmed length of 25.9\u00a0m (85\u00a0ft),[10] a maximum recorded weight of nearly 74 tonnes (73 long tons; 82 short tons),[11] and a maximum estimated weight of around 114 tonnes (112 long tons; 126 short tons). American naturalist Roy Chapman Andrews called the fin whale \"the greyhound of the sea ... for its beautiful, slender body is built like a racing yacht and the animal can surpass the speed of the fastest ocean steamship.\"[12]\n\n\nThe fin whale's body is long and slender, coloured brownish-grey with a paler underside. At least two recognized subspecies exist, in the North Atlantic and the Southern Hemisphere. It is found in all the major oceans, from polar to tropical waters. It is absent only from waters close to the pack ice at the poles and relatively small areas of water away from the open ocean. The highest population density occurs in temperate and cool waters.[13] Its food consists of small schooling fish, squid, and crustaceans including copepods and krill.\n\n\nLike all other large whales, the fin whale was heavily hunted during the 20th century. As a result, it is an endangered species. Over 725,000 fin whales were reportedly taken from the Southern Hemisphere between 1905 and 1976; as of 1997 only 38,000 survived.[2] Recovery of the overall population size of southern subspecies is predicted to be at less than 50% of its pre-whaling state by 2100 due to heavier impacts of whaling and slower recovery rates.[14]\n\n\nThe International Whaling Commission (IWC) issued a moratorium on commercial hunting of this whale,[15] although Iceland and Japan have resumed hunting. The species is also hunted by Greenlanders under the IWC's Aboriginal Subsistence Whaling provisions. Global population estimates range from less than 100,000 to roughly 119,000.[2][16]\nThe fin whale is estimated to be the most common wild mammal species by total biomass, at about 8 million tons (only surpassed by humans and several domestic mammal species).[17][18]\n\n\n\n\n## Taxonomy[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Evolution of cetaceans\n\n![Taxonomy diagram](image)A cladogram of animals related to the fin whale\nThe fin whale was first described by Friderich Martens in 1675 and by Paul Dudley in 1725. The former description was used as the primary basis of the species *Balaena physalus* by Carl Linnaeus in 1758.[19] In 1804, Bernard Germain de Lac\u00e9p\u00e8de reclassified the species as *Balaenoptera rorqual*, based on a specimen that had stranded on \u00cele Sainte-Marguerite (Cannes, France) in 1798. In 1830, Louis Companyo described a specimen that had stranded near Saint-Cyprien, southern France, in 1828 as *Balaena musculus*. Most later authors followed him in using the specific name *musculus*, until Frederick W. True (1898) showed that it referred to the blue whale. In 1846, British taxonomist John Edward Gray described a 16.7\u00a0m (55\u00a0ft) specimen from the Falkland Islands as *Balaenoptera australis*. In 1865, German naturalist Hermann Burmeister described a roughly 15\u00a0m (49\u00a0ft) specimen found near Buenos Aires about 30 years earlier as *Balaenoptera patachonicus*. In 1903, Romanian scientist Emil Racovi\u021b\u0103 placed all these designations into *Balaenoptera physalus*.[20][21] The word *physalus* comes from the Greek word *physa*, meaning \"blows\", referring to the prominent blow of the species.[22]\n\n\nFin whales are rorquals, members of the family Balaenopteridae, which also includes the humpback whale, the blue whale, Bryde's whale, the sei whale, and the minke whales. The family diverged from the other baleen whales in the suborder Mysticeti as long ago as the middle Miocene.[23]\n\n\nRecent DNA evidence indicates the fin whale may be more closely related to the humpback whale (*Megaptera novaeangliae*) and in at least one study the gray whale (*Eschrichtius robustus*), two whales in different genera, than it is to members of its own genus, such as the minke whales.[24][25][26][27] \nAs of 2023, four subspecies are named, each with distinct physical features and vocalizations. The **northern fin whale**, *B. p. physalus* (Linnaeus 1758) inhabits the North Atlantic and the **southern fin whale**, *B. p. quoyi* (Fischer 1829) occupies the Southern Hemisphere.[28] Most experts consider the fin whales of the North Pacific to be a third subspecies\u2014this was supported by a 2013 study, which found that the Northern Hemisphere *B. p. physalus* was not composed of a single subspecies.[29] A 2019 genetic study concluded that the North Pacific fin whales should be considered a subspecies, suggesting the name *B. p. velifera* (Scammon 1869). The three groups mix at most rarely.[30]\n\n\nClarke (2004) proposed a \"pygmy\" subspecies (*B. p. patachonica*, Burmeister, 1865) that is purportedly darker in colour and has black baleen. He based this on a single physically mature 19.8\u00a0m (65\u00a0ft) female caught in the Antarctic in 1947\u201348, the smaller average size (a few feet) of sexually and physically mature fin whales caught by the Japanese around 50\u00b0S, and smaller, darker sexually immature fin whales caught in the Antarctic which he believed were a \"migratory phase\" of his proposed subspecies.[31] The subspecies has not been genetically established,[30] and is not recognized by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.[32]\n\n\n\n### Hybrids[edit]\n\n\nThe genetic distance between blue and fin whales has been compared to that between a gorilla and human[33] (3.5 million years on the evolutionary tree.[34]) Nevertheless, hybrid individuals between blue and fin whales with characteristics of both are known to occur with relative frequency in both the North Atlantic and North Pacific.[35][36]\n\n\nThe DNA profile of a sampling of whale meat in the Japanese market found evidence of blue/fin hybrids.[37][38]\n\n\n\n## Anatomy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fin whale skeleton\n![](image)Fin whales often travel in pairs.\n![](image)A fin whale in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, showing characteristic backswept dorsal fin\n![](image)Fin whale arching for a deep dive\n### Size[edit]\n\n\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, the average size of adult males and females is about 18.5 and 20 metres (61 and 66\u00a0ft), respectively, averaging 38.5 and 50.5 tonnes (42.5 and 55.5 tons),[11] while in the Southern Hemisphere, it is 20.5 and 22\u00a0m (67 and 72\u00a0ft),[39] weighing 52.5 and 63 tonnes (58 and 69.5 tons).[11]\n\n\nIn the North Atlantic, the longest reported were a 24.4\u00a0m (80\u00a0ft) male caught off Shetland in 1905 and a 25\u00a0m (82\u00a0ft) female caught off Scotland sometime between 1908 and 1914,[40][41] while the longest reliably measured were three 20.7\u00a0m (68\u00a0ft) males caught off Iceland in 1973\u201374 and a 22.5\u00a0m (74\u00a0ft) female also caught off Iceland in 1975.[42][43] Mediterranean population are generally smaller, reaching just above 20\u00a0m (65.5\u00a0ft) at maximum, or possibly up to 21\u201323\u00a0m (68.9\u201375.5\u00a0ft).[44]\n\n\nIn the North Pacific, the longest reported were three 22.9\u00a0m (75\u00a0ft) males, two caught off California between 1919 and 1926 and the other caught off Alaska in 1925, and a 24.7\u00a0m (81\u00a0ft) female also caught off California, while the longest reliably measured were a 21\u00a0m (69\u00a0ft) male caught off British Columbia in 1959 and a 22.9\u00a0m (75\u00a0ft) female caught off central California between 1959 and 1970.[45][46][47]\n\n\nIn the Southern Hemisphere, the longest reported were a 25\u00a0m (82\u00a0ft) male and a 27.3\u00a0m (89.6\u00a0ft) female, while the longest measured by Mackintosh and Wheeler (1929) were a 22.65\u00a0m (74.3\u00a0ft) male and a 24.53\u00a0m (80.5\u00a0ft) female.[9] Major F. A. Spencer, while whaling inspector of the factory ship *Southern Princess* (1936\u201338), confirmed the length of a 25.9\u00a0m (85\u00a0ft) female caught in the Antarctic, south of the Indian Ocean;[10] scientist David Edward Gaskin also measured a 25.9\u00a0m female as whaling inspector of the British factory ship *Southern Venturer* in the Southern Ocean in the 1961\u201362 season.[48] Terence Wise, who worked as a winch operator aboard the British factory ship *Balaena*, claimed that \"the biggest fin [he] ever saw\" was a 25.6\u00a0m (84\u00a0ft) specimen caught near Bouvet Island in January 1958.[49] The largest fin whale ever weighed (piecemeal) was a 22.7\u00a0m (74\u00a0ft) pregnant female caught by Japanese whalers in the Antarctic in 1948 which weighed 69.5 tonnes (68.4 long tons), not including 6% for loss of fluids during the flensing process.[11] An individual at the maximum confirmed size of 25.9 m is estimated to weigh around 95 tonnes (104.5 tons),[11] varying from about 76 tonnes (84 tons) to 114 tonnes (125.5 tons) depending on fat condition which varies by about 50% during the year.[50]\n\n\nA newborn fin whale measures about 6.0\u20136.5\u00a0m (19.7\u201321.3\u00a0ft) in length and weighs about 1,800 kilograms (4,000\u00a0lb).[51]\n\n\n\n### Colouration and markings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)At Porcupine Seabight, South West Ireland\n![](image)Fin whale showing colouring on right side\n![](image)At Porcupine Seabight, South West Ireland, showing chevron between its flippers\n![](image)Aerial view of a fin whale, showing V-shaped chevron\nThe fin whale is brownish to dark or light gray dorsally and white ventrally. The left side of the head is dark gray, while the right side exhibits a complex pattern of contrasting light and dark markings. On the right lower jaw is a white or light gray \"right mandible patch\", which sometimes extends out as a light \"blaze\" laterally and dorsally unto the upper jaw and back to just behind the blowholes. Two narrow dark stripes originate from the eye and ear, the former widening into a large dark area on the shoulder\u2014these are separated by a light area called the \"interstripe wash\". These markings are more prominent on individuals in the North Atlantic than in the North Pacific, where they can appear indistinct. The left side exhibits similar but much fainter markings. Dark, oval-shaped areas of pigment called \"flipper shadows\" extend below and posterior to the pectoral fins. This type of asymmetry is seen in Omura's whale and occasionally in minke whales. It was thought to have evolved because the whale swims on its right side when surface lunging and it sometimes circles to the right while at the surface above a prey patch. However, the whales just as often circle to the left. No accepted hypothesis explains the asymmetry.[52]\nIt has paired blowholes and a broad, flat, V-shaped rostrum. A light V-shaped marking, the chevron, begins behind the blowholes and extends back and then forward again.[8]\n\n\nThe whale has a series of 56\u2013100 pleats or grooves along the bottom of the body that run from the tip of the chin to the navel that allow the throat area to expand greatly during feeding. It has a curved, prominent dorsal fin that ranges in height from 26\u201375\u00a0cm (10\u201330\u00a0in) (usually 45\u201360\u00a0cm\u00a0[18\u201324\u00a0in]) and averages about 51\u00a0cm (20\u00a0in), lying about three quarters of the way along the back.[9] Its flippers are small and tapered and its tail is wide, pointed at the tip, and notched in the centre.[16]\n\n\nWhen the whale surfaces, the dorsal fin is visible soon after the spout. The spout is vertical and narrow and can reach heights of 6\u00a0m (20\u00a0ft) or more.[16]\n\n\n\n### Nervous system[edit]\n\n\nThe oral cavity of the fin whale has a very stretchy or extensible nerve system which aids them in feeding.[53]\n\n\n\n## Life history[edit]\n\n\nMating occurs in temperate, low-latitude seas during the winter, followed by an 11- to 12-month gestation period. A newborn weans from its mother at 6 or 7 months of age when it is 11 to 12\u00a0m (36 to 39\u00a0ft) in length, and the calf accompanies the mother to the summer feeding ground. Females reproduce every 2 or 3 years, with as many as six fetuses being reported, but single births are far more common. Females reach sexual maturity between 6 and 12 years of age at lengths of 17.7\u201319\u00a0m (58\u201362\u00a0ft) in the Northern Hemisphere and 20\u00a0m (66\u00a0ft) in the Southern Hemisphere.[39] Calves remain with their mothers for about one year.[54]\n\n\nFull physical maturity is attained between 25 and 30 years. Fin whales have a maximum life span of at least 94 years of age,[55] although specimens have been found aged at an estimated 135\u2013140 years.[56]\n\n\nThe fin whale is one of the fastest cetaceans and can sustain speeds between 37\u00a0km/h (23\u00a0mph)[51] and 41\u00a0km/h (25\u00a0mph) and bursts up to 46\u00a0km/h (29\u00a0mph) have been recorded, earning the fin whale the nickname \"the greyhound of the sea\".[57]\n\n\nFin whales are more gregarious than other rorquals, and often live in groups of 6\u201310, although feeding groups may reach up to 100 animals.[55]\n\n\n\n### Vocalizations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Whale sound and List of whale vocalizations\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Multimedia relating to the fin whale***The whale calls have been sped up 10x from their original speed.*\n |\n| ![](image)\n\nA fin whale song\n\n\nRecorded in the Atlantic\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file? See media help.*\n |\n\n\nLike other whales, males make long, loud, low-frequency sounds.[51] The vocalizations of blue and fin whales are the lowest-frequency sounds made by any animal.[58] Most sounds are frequency-modulated (FM) down-swept infrasonic pulses from 16 to 40\u00a0hertz frequency (the range of sounds that most humans can hear falls between 20\u00a0hertz and 20\u00a0kilohertz). Each sound lasts one to two seconds, and various sound combinations occur in patterned sequences lasting 7 to 15 minutes each. The whale then repeats the sequences in bouts lasting up to many days.[59] The vocal sequences have source levels of up to 184\u2013186\u00a0decibels relative to 1\u00a0micropascal at a reference distance of one metre and can be detected hundreds of miles from their source.[60]\n\n\nWhen fin whale sounds were first recorded by US biologists, they did not realize that these unusually loud, long, pure and regular sounds were being made by whales. They first investigated the possibilities that the sounds were due to equipment malfunction, geophysical phenomena, or even part of a Soviet Union scheme for detecting enemy submarines. Eventually, biologists demonstrated that the sounds were the vocalizations of fin whales.[58]\n\n\nDirect association of these vocalizations with the reproductive season for the species and that only males make the sounds point to these vocalizations as possible reproductive displays.[61][62] Over the past 100 years, the dramatic increase in ocean noise from shipping and naval activity may have slowed the recovery of the fin whale population, by impeding communications between males and receptive females.[63]\n\n\nFin whale songs can penetrate over 2,500\u00a0m (8,200\u00a0ft) below the sea floor and seismologists can use those song waves to assist in underwater surveys.[64]\n\n\n\n### Breathing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Surfacing in the Kenai Fjords, Alaska\nWhen feeding, they blow five to seven times in quick succession, but while traveling or resting will blow once every minute or two. On their terminal (last) dive they arch their back high out of the water, but rarely raise their flukes out of the water. They then dive to depths of up to 470\u00a0m (1,540\u00a0ft) when feeding or a few hundred feet when resting or traveling. The average feeding dive off California and Baja lasts 6 minutes, with a maximum of 17 minutes; when traveling or resting they usually dive for only a few minutes at a time.[65]\n\n\n\n## Ecology[edit]\n\n\n### Range and habitat[edit]\n\n\nLike many large rorquals, the fin whale is a cosmopolitan species. It is found in all the world's major oceans and in waters ranging from the polar to the tropical. It is absent only from waters close to the ice pack at both the north and south extremities and relatively small areas of water away from the large oceans, such as the Red Sea, although they can reach into the Baltic Sea, a marginal sea of such conditions.[66][67][68][69] The highest population density occurs in temperate and cool waters. It is less densely populated in the warmest, equatorial regions.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe North Atlantic fin whale has an extensive distribution, occurring from the Gulf of Mexico and Mediterranean Sea, northward to Baffin Bay and Spitsbergen. In general, fin whales are more common north of approximately 30\u00b0N latitude, but considerable confusion arises about their occurrence south of 30\u00b0N latitude because of the difficulty in distinguishing fin whales from Bryde's whales.[70] Extensive ship surveys have led researchers to conclude that the summer feeding range of fin whales in the western North Atlantic is mainly between 41\u00b020'N and 51\u00b000'N, from shore seaward to the 1,000 fathoms (1,800\u00a0m) contour.[71]\n\n\nSummer distribution of fin whales in the North Pacific is the immediate offshore waters from central Baja California to Japan and as far north as the Chukchi Sea bordering the Arctic Ocean.[72] They occur in high densities in the northern Gulf of Alaska and southeastern Bering Sea between May and October, with some movement through the Aleutian passes into and out of the Bering Sea.[73] Several whales tagged between November and January off southern California were killed in the summer off central California, Oregon, British Columbia, and in the Gulf of Alaska.[72] Fin whales have been observed feeding 250 miles south of Hawaii in mid-May, and several winter sightings have been made there.[74] Some researchers have suggested that the whales migrate into Hawaiian waters primarily in the autumn and winter.[75]\n\n\nAlthough fin whales are certainly migratory, moving seasonally in and out of high-latitude feeding areas, the overall migration pattern is not well understood. Acoustic readings from passive-listening hydrophone arrays indicate a southward migration of the North Atlantic fin whale occurs in the autumn from the Labrador-Newfoundland region, south past Bermuda, and into the West Indies.[76] One or more populations of fin whales are thought to remain year-round in high latitudes, moving offshore, but not southward in late autumn.[76] A study based on resightings of identified fin whales in Massachusetts Bay indicates that calves often learn migratory routes from their mothers and return to their mother's feeding area in subsequent years.[54]\n\n\nIn the Pacific, migration patterns are poorly characterized. Although some fin whales are apparently present year-round in the Gulf of California, there is a significant increase in their numbers in the winter and spring.[77] Southern fin whales migrate seasonally from relatively high-latitude Antarctic feeding grounds in the summer to low-latitude breeding and calving areas in the winter. The location of winter breeding areas is still unknown, since these whales tend to migrate in the open ocean.[13]\n\n\n\n### Population and trends[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A frontal view of a fin whale, showing asymmetrical colouration\n#### North Atlantic[edit]\n\n\n![Photo of stamp displaying diving whale with bent tail with Faroyar printed across the top and Nebbafiskur and Baelaenoptera physalus in successively smaller print at bottom](image)Drawing of a fin whale on a Faroese stamp, issued 17 September 2001\nNorth Atlantic fin whales are defined by the International Whaling Commission to exist in one of seven discrete population zones: Nova Scotia-New England, Newfoundland-Labrador, western Greenland, eastern Greenland-Iceland, North Norway, West Norway-Faroe Islands, and Ireland-Spain-United Kingdom-Portugal. Results of mark-and-recapture surveys have indicated that some movement occurs across the boundaries of these zones, suggesting that they are not entirely discrete and that some immigration and emigration does occur.[71] Sigurj\u00f3nsson estimated in 1995 that total pre-exploitation population size in the entire North Atlantic ranged between 50,000 and 100,000 animals,[78] but his research is criticized for lack of supporting data and an explanation of his reasoning.[13] In 1977, D.E. Sergeant suggested a \"primeval\" aggregate total of 30,000 to 50,000 throughout the North Atlantic.[79] Of that number, 8,000 to 9,000 would have resided in the Newfoundland and Nova Scotia areas, with whales summering in U.S. waters south of Nova Scotia presumably omitted.[13][80] J. M. Breiwick estimated that the \"exploitable\" (above the legal size limit of 50\u00a0feet) component of the Nova Scotia population was 1,500 to 1,600 animals in 1964, reduced to only about 325 in 1973.[81] Two aerial surveys in Canadian waters since the early 1970s gave numbers of 79 to 926 whales on the eastern Newfoundland-Labrador shelf in August 1980,[82] and a few hundred in the northern and central Gulf of Saint Lawrence in August 1995 \u2013 1996.[83] Summer estimates in the waters off western Greenland range between 500 and 2,000,[84] and in 1974, Jonsgard considered the fin whales off Western Norway and the Faroe Islands to \"have been considerably depleted in postwar years, probably by overexploitation\".[85] The population around Iceland appears to have fared much better, and in 1981, appeared to have undergone only a minor decline since the early 1960s.[86] Surveys during the summers of 1987 and 1989 estimated of 10,000 to 11,000 between eastern Greenland and Norway.[87] This shows a substantial recovery when compared to a survey in 1976 showing an estimate of 6,900, which was considered to be a \"slight\" decline since 1948.[88] A Spanish NASS survey in 1989 of the France-Portugal-Spain sub-area estimated a summer population range at 17,355.[89] A formal population assessment has not been conducted since 2016 for the North Atlantic, when the population was estimated to include 70,000 individuals, but population models published by IUCN in 2018 suggest that the number of individuals in the wild is increasing.[90]\n\n\nA possible resident group was in waters off the Cape Verde Islands in 2000 and 2001.[91]\n\n\n\n#### Mediterranean Sea[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fin whale and a boat in the Strait of Gibraltar\nSatellite tracking revealed that those found in Pelagos Sanctuary migrate southward to off Tunisia, Malta,[92][93][94] Pantelleria,[95] and Sicily,[96] and also possibly winter off coastal southern Italy, Sardinia,[97] within the Strait of Messina, Aeolian Islands, and off Catalonia,[98][99] Cabrera Archipelago,[100][101] Libya, Kerkennah Islands, Tuscan Archipelago,[102][103] Ischia and adjacent gulfs (e.g. Naples and Pozzuoli[104]), winter feeding ground of Lampedusa,[105][106][107] and whales may recolonize out of the Ligurian Sea to other areas such as in Ionian and in Adriatic Sea. Biology of the species along southern and southeastern parts of the basin such as off Libya, Algeria, and northern Egypt, is unclear due to lacks of scientific approaches although whales have been confirmed off the furthermost of the basin such as along in shore waters of Levantine Sea including Israel,[108] Lebanon,[109] and Cyprus.[110][111] Documented records within Turkish waters have been in very small numbers; one sighting off Antalya in 1994[112] and five documented strandings as of 2016.[113] and a recent sighting on 9 February 2021 by fishermen off the coast of Adana has been documented with images.[114]\n\n\nIt has been shown that populations of Fin whales within the mediterranean have preferred feeding locations that partially overlap with high concentrations of plastic pollution and microplastic debris. High concentrations of microplastics most likely overlap with Fin whales preferred feeding grounds because both microplastic and the whale's food sources are near high trophic upwelling areas.[115]\n\n\n\n#### North Pacific[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Finback Whale Skull, San Diego Natural History Museum\nThe total historical North Pacific population was estimated at 42,000 to 45,000 before the start of whaling. Of this, the population in the eastern portion of the North Pacific was estimated to be 25,000 to 27,000.[116] By 1975, the estimate had declined to between 8,000 and 16,000.[72][117] Surveys conducted in 1991, 1993, 1996, and 2001 produced estimates between 1,600 and 3,200 off California and 280 and 380 off Oregon and Washington.[118] The minimum estimate for the California-Oregon-Washington population, as defined in the *U.S. Pacific Marine Mammal Stock Assessments: 2005*, is about 2,500.[119] Surveys in coastal waters of British Columbia in summers 2004 and 2005 produced abundance estimates of approximately 500 animals.[120] Surveys near the Pribilof Islands in the Bering Sea indicated a substantial increase in the local abundance of fin whales between 1975\u20131978 and 1987\u20131989.[121] In 1984, the entire population was estimated to be less than 38% of its historic carrying capacity.[122] Fin whales might have started returning to the coastal waters off British Columbia (a sighting occurred in Johnstone Strait in 2011[123]) and Kodiak Island. Size of the local population migrating to Hawaiian Archipelago is unknown.[124] Historically, several other wintering grounds were scattered in the North Pacific in the past, such as off the Northern Mariana Islands, Bonin Islands, and Ryukyu Islands. There was a sighting of 3 animals nearby Borneo and Palawan in 1999.[125]\n\n\nFor Asian stocks, resident groups may exist in the Yellow Sea and East China Sea, and the Sea of Japan (though these populations are critically endangered and the population off China, Korea, and Japan are either near extinction or in very small numbers). Very small increases in sightings have been confirmed off Shiretoko Peninsula, Abashiri, Kushiro,[126] Tsushima, Sado Island[127] and off Maizuru[128]\n\n\nStudies of historical catches suggest several resident groups once existed in the North Pacific\u2014the Baja California group and the Yellow Sea\u2013East China Sea (including Ryukyu Islands and western Kyusyu) group.[129] Additionally, respective groups in northern Sea of Japan and the group along Pacific coasts of Japan from Hokkaido to Sanriku might have been resident or less migratory, as well. The only modern record among Ryukyu Islands was of a rotten carcass beached on Ishigaki Island in 2005.[130] Regarding Yellow Sea, a juvenile was accidentally killed along Boryeong in 2014.[131]\n\n\nThere had been congregation areas among Sea of Japan to Yellow Sea such as in East Korea Bay, along eastern coasts of Korean Peninsula, and Ulleungdo.[132]\n\n\nModern sightings around the Commander Islands have been annual but not in great numbers, and whales likely to migrate through the areas rather than summering, and possible mixing of western and eastern populations are expected to occur in these waters.[133]\n\n\n\n#### South Pacific[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Alfaguara project\n\nVery little information has been revealed about the ecology of current migration from Antarctic waters are unknown, but small increases in sighting rates are confirmed off New Zealand, such as off Kaik\u014dura, and wintering grounds may exist in further north such as in Papua New Guinea, Fiji,[134] and off East Timor. Confirmations in Rarotonga have been increased recently[135] where interactions with humpback whales occur on occasions.[136] Finbacks are also relatively abundant along the coast of Peru and Chile (in Chile, most notably off Los Lagos region such as Gulf of Corcovado[137] in Chilo\u00e9 National Park, Punta de Choros[es],[138][139] port of Mejillones,[140][141] and Caleta Zorra. Year-round confirmations indicate possible residents off pelagic north eastern to central Chile such as around coastal Caleta Cha\u00f1aral and Ping\u00fcino de Humboldt National Reserve, east of Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands, and northeast of Easter Island and possible wintering ground exist for eastern south Pacific population.[142]\n\n\n\n#### Other[edit]\n\n\nAmong Northern Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal, such as along Sri Lanka, India, and Malaysia, sightings and older records of fin whales exist.[143][144][145]\n\n\n\n#### Antarctica[edit]\n\n\nRelatively little is known about the historical and current population levels of the southern fin whale. The IWC officially estimates that the Southern Hemisphere pre-whaling population was 400,000 whales and that the population in 1979 (at the cessation of Antarctic large scale whaling) was 85,200.[146] Both the current and historical estimates should be considered as poor estimates because the methodology and data used in the study are known to be flawed.[13] Other estimates cite current size to be between 15,000 (1983) and 38,000 (1997).[2] As of 2006, there is no scientifically accepted estimate of current population or trends in abundance.[13]\n\n\n\n### Predation[edit]\n\n\nThe only known predator of the fin whale is the killer whale, with at least 20 eyewitness and second-hand accounts of attack or harassment. They usually flee and offer little resistance to attack. Only a few confirmed fatalities have occurred. In October 2005, 16 killer whales attacked and killed a fin whale in the Canal de Ballenas, Gulf of California, after chasing it for about an hour. They fed on its sinking carcass for about 15 minutes before leaving the area. In June 2012, a pod of killer whales was seen in La Paz Bay, in the Gulf of California, chasing a fin whale for over an hour before finally killing it and feeding on its carcass. The whale bore numerous tooth rakes over its back and dorsal fin; several killer whales flanked it on either side, with one individual visible under water biting at its right lower jaw.[147] In July 1908, a whaler reportedly saw two killer whales attack and kill a fin whale off western Greenland. In January 1984, seven were seen from the air circling, holding the flippers, and ramming a fin whale in the Gulf of California, but the observation ended at nightfall.[148][149]\n\n\n\n### Feeding[edit]\n\n\n![Photo of whale at surface](image)Overhead view of a fin whale feeding\n![](image)Fin whale lunge feeding at the surface\n![](image)Fin whale being flensed at the Hvalfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur whaling station in Iceland, showing the baleen bristles used to filter prey organisms\n![](image)The whaling historian Sigurd Risting sitting on the baleen bristles of a fin whale landed at a whaling station in the Shetland Islands (1912)\nThe fin whale is a filter-feeder, feeding on small schooling fish, squid and crustaceans including copepods and krill. In the North Pacific, they feed on krill in the genera *Euphausia*, *Thysanoessa*, and *Nyctiphanes*, large copepods in the genus *Neocalanus*, small schooling fish (e.g. the genera *Engraulis*, *Mallotus*, *Clupea*, and *Theragra*), and squid. Based on stomach content analysis of over 19,500 fin whales caught by the Japanese whaling fleet in the North Pacific from 1952 to 1971, 64.1% contained only krill, 25.5% copepods, 5.0% fish, 3.4% krill and copepods and 1.7% squid.[150] Nemoto (1959) analyzed the stomach contents of about 7500 fin whales caught in the northern North Pacific and Bering Sea from 1952 to 1958, found that they mainly preyed on euphausiids around the Aleutian Islands and in the Gulf of Alaska and schooling fish in the northern Bering Sea and off Kamchatka. In the northern Bering Sea (north of 58\u00b0N), their main prey species were capelin (*Mallotus villosus*), Alaska pollock (*Theragra chalcogramma*) and Pacific herring (*Clupea pallasii*); they also consumed saffron cod (*Eleginus gracilis*). Arctic krill (*Thysanoessa raschii*) was the only species of euphausiid found in the stomachs of fin whales in the northern Bering Sea. Off Kamchatka, they appeared to primarily feed on herring. They also took large quantities of the copepod *Neocalanus cristatus* around the Aleutian Islands and in Olyutor Bay off northeast Kamchatka, areas where the species was abundant. Five species of euphausiid (*Euphausia pacifica*, *Thysanoessa spinifera*, *T. inermis*, *T. raschii*, and *T. longipes*) were the predominant prey around the Aleutian Islands and in the Gulf of Alaska. Prey varied by region in the Kuril Islands area, with euphausiids (*T. longipes*, *T. inermis*, and *T. raschii*) and copepods (*Neocalanus plumchrus* and *N. cristatus*) being the main prey in the northern area and Japanese flying squid (*Todarodes pacificus pacificus*) and small schooling fish (e.g. Pacific saury, *Cololabis saira*; and Japanese anchovy, *Engraulis japonicus*) dominating the diet in the southern area.[151]\n\n\nOf the fin whale stomachs sampled off British Columbia between 1963 and 1967, euphausiids dominated the diet for four of the five years (82.3 to 100% of the diet), while copepods only formed a major portion of the diet in 1965 (35.7%). Miscellaneous fish, squid, and octopus played only a very minor part of the diet in two of the five years (3.6 to 4.8%).[152] Fin whales caught off California between 1959 and 1970 fed on the pelagic euphausiid *Euphausia pacifica* (86% of sampled individuals), the more neritic euphausiid *Thysanoessa spinifera* (9%), and the northern anchovy (*Engraulis mordax*) (7%); only trace amounts (<0.5% each) were found of Pacific saury (*C. saira*) and juvenile rockfish (*Sebastes jordani*).[153] In the Gulf of California, they have been observed feeding on swarms of the euphausiid *Nyctiphanes simplex*.\n\n\nIn the North Atlantic, they prey on euphausiids in the genera *Meganyctiphanes*, *Thysanoessa* and *Nyctiphanes* and small schooling fish (e.g. the genera *Clupea*, *Mallotus*, and *Ammodytes*). Of the 1,609 fin whale stomachs examined at the Hvalfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur whaling station in southwestern Iceland from 1967 to 1989 (caught between June and September), 96% contained only krill, 2.5% krill and fish, 0.8% some fish remains, 0.7% capelin (*M. villosus*), and 0.1% sandeel (family Ammodytidae); a small proportion of (mainly juvenile) blue whiting (*Micromesistius poutassou*) were also found. Of the krill sampled between 1979 and 1989, the vast majority (over 99%) was northern krill (*Meganyctiphanes norvegica*); only one stomach contained *Thysanoessa longicaudata*.[154] Off West Greenland, 75% of the fin whales caught between July and October had consumed krill (family Euphausiidae), 17% capelin (*Mallotus*) and 8% sand lance (*Ammodytes sp.*). Off eastern Newfoundland, they chiefly feed on capelin, but also take small quantities of euphausiids (mostly *T. raschii* and *T. inermis*).[79] In the Ligurian-Corsican-Proven\u00e7al Basin in the Mediterranean Sea they make dives as deep as 470\u00a0m (1,540\u00a0ft) to feed on the euphausiid *Meganyctiphanes norvegica*, while off the island of Lampedusa, between Tunisia and Sicily, they have been observed in mid-winter feeding on surface swarms of the small euphausiid *Nyctiphanes couchi*.[155]\n\n\nIn the Southern Hemisphere, they feed almost exclusively on euphausiids (mainly the genera *Euphausia* and *Thysanoessa*), as well as taking small amounts of amphipods (e.g. *Themisto gaudichaudii*) and various species of fish. Of the more than 16,000 fin whales caught by the Japanese whaling fleet in the Southern Hemisphere between 1961 and 1965 that contained food in their stomachs, 99.4% fed on euphausiids, 0.5% on fish, and 0.1% on amphipods.[150] In the Southern Ocean they mainly consume *E. superba*.[156][157][158]\n\n\nThe animal feeds by opening its jaws while swimming at some 11\u00a0km/h (6.8\u00a0mph) in one study,[159] which causes it to engulf up to 70 cubic metres (18,000\u00a0US\u00a0gal; 15,000\u00a0imp\u00a0gal) of water in one gulp. It then closes its jaws and pushes the water back out of its mouth through its baleen, which allows the water to leave while trapping the prey. An adult has between 262 and 473 baleen plates on each side of the mouth. Each plate is made of keratin that frays out into fine hairs on the ends inside the mouth near the tongue. Each plate can measure up to 76\u00a0cm (30\u00a0in) in length and 30\u00a0cm (12\u00a0in) in width.[8]\n\n\nThe whale routinely dives to depths of more than 200\u00a0m (660\u00a0ft) where it executes an average of four \"lunges\", to accumulate krill. Each gulp provides the whale with approximately 10\u00a0kg (22\u00a0lb) of food.[159] One whale can consume up to 1,800\u00a0kg (4,000\u00a0lb) of food a day,[8] leading scientists to conclude that the whale spends about three hours a day feeding to meet its energy requirements, roughly the same as humans. If prey *patches* are not sufficiently dense, or are located too deep in the water, the whale has to spend a larger portion of its day searching for food.[159] One hunting technique is to circle schools of fish at high speed, frightening the fish into a tight ball, then turning on its side before engulfing the massed prey.[8]\n\n\n\n### Parasites, epibiotics, and pathology[edit]\n\n\nFin whales suffer from a number of pathological conditions. The parasitic copepod *Pennella balaenopterae*\u2014usually found on the flank of fin whales\u2014burrows into their blubber to feed on their blood,[160] while the pseudo-stalked barnacle *Xenobalanus globicipitis* is generally found more often on the dorsal fin, pectoral fins, and flukes.[161]\n\n\nOther barnacles found on fin whales include the acorn barnacle *Coronula reginae* and the stalked barnacle *Conchoderma auritum*, which attaches to *Coronula* or the baleen. The harpacticid copepod *Balaenophilus unisetus* (heavy infestations of which have been found in fin whales caught off northwestern Spain) and the ciliate *Haematophagus* also infest the baleen, the former feeding on the baleen itself and the latter on red blood cells.[10]\n\n\nThe remora *Remora australis* and occasionally the amphipod *Cyamus balaenopterae* can also be found on fin whales, both feeding on the skin. Infestations of the giant nematode *Crassicauda boopis* can cause inflammation of the renal arteries and potential kidney failure, while the smaller *C. crassicauda* infects the lower urinary tract.[122] Out of 87 whales taken and necropsied from the North Atlantic, infection from *Crassicauda* *boopis* was found to be very prevalent and invasive, indicating high probability that it was responsible for causing death in these whales.[162] *C. boopis* was found in 94% of the whales examined. The worms were usually enveloped by \"exuberant tissue reactions which in some whales obstructed multiple renal veins\". The parasite was most likely by environmental contamination, involving shedding of larvae in urine. Major inflammatory lesions in the mesenteric arteries suggested that the worm larvae were ingested and migrated to the kidney.[162]\n\n\nThese observations suggest that infection from *C. boopis* can be \"lethal by inducing congestive renal failure\". Injury to the vascular system is also a result of moderate infections. Therefore, the implication can be made that the feeding migration of fin whales every year in circumpolar waters can be associated with pathologic risk.[162]\n\n\nAn emaciated 13\u00a0m (43\u00a0ft) female fin whale, which stranded along the Belgian coast in 1997, was found to be infected with lesions of *Morbillivirus*.[163] In January 2011, a 16.7\u00a0m (55\u00a0ft) emaciated adult male fin whale stranded dead on the Tyrrhenian coastline of Italy was found to be infected with *Morbillivirus* and the protozoa *Toxoplasma gondii*, as well as carrying heavy loads of organochlorine pollutants.[164]\n\n\n\n## Human interaction[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**.

However, the later introduction of steam-powered boats and harpoons that exploded on impact made it possible to kill and secure them along with blue and sei whales on an industrial scale. As other whale species became overhunted, the whaling industry turned to the still-abundant fin whale as a substitute.[165] It was primarily hunted for its blubber, oil, and baleen. Around 704,000 fin whales were caught in Antarctic whaling operations alone between 1904 and 1975.[166]\n\n\nThe introduction of factory ships with stern slipways in 1925 substantially increased the number of whales taken per year. In 1937\u201338 alone, over 29,000 fin whales were taken. From 1953\u201354 to 1961\u201362, the catch averaged over 30,000 per year. By 1962\u201363, sei whale catches began to increase as fin whales became scarce. By 1975\u201376, fewer than 1,000 fin whales were being caught each year. In the North Pacific, over 74,000 fin whales were caught between 1910 and 1975.[167] Between 1910 and 1989, over 55,000 were caught in the North Atlantic.[168] Coastal groups in northeast Asian waters, along with many other baleen species, were likely driven into serious perils or functional extinctions by industrial catches by Japan covering wide ranges of China and Korean EEZ within a very short period in the 20th century.[169] Migrations of the species into Japanese EEZ and in East China Sea were likely to be exterminated relatively earlier, as the last catch records on Amami \u014cshima was between the 1910s and 1930s.[170] After the cease of exploiting Asian stocks, Japan kept mass commercial and illegal hunts until 1975. Several thousand individuals were hunted from various stations mainly along coasts of Hokkaido, Sanriku, and the Got\u014d Islands.[171]\n\n\nThe IWC prohibited hunting in the Southern Hemisphere in 1976.[166] The Soviet Union engaged in the illegal killing of protected whale species in the North Pacific and Southern Hemisphere, over-reporting fin whale catches to cover up illegal takes of other species. In the North Pacific, they reported taking over 10,000 fin whales between 1961 and 1979, while the true catch was less than 9,000. In the Southern Hemisphere, they reported taking nearly 53,000 between 1948 and 1973, when the true total was a little over 41,000.[172][173][174] The fin whale was given full protection from commercial whaling by the IWC in the North Pacific in 1976, and in the North Atlantic in 1987, with small exceptions for aboriginal catches and catches for research purposes.[51] All populations worldwide remain listed as endangered species by the US National Marine Fisheries Service and the International Conservation Union Red List. The fin whale is on Appendix 1 of CITES.[2][175][176]\n\n\nThe IWC has set a quota of 19 fin whales per year for Greenland. Meat and other products from whales killed in these hunts are widely marketed within Greenland, but export is illegal. Iceland and Norway are not bound by the IWC's moratorium on commercial whaling because both countries filed objections to it.[13]\n\n\nIn October 2006, Iceland's fisheries ministry authorized the hunting of 9 fin whales through August 2007.[177] In 2009 and 2010, Iceland caught 125 and 148 fin whales, respectively.[178] An Icelandic company, Hvalur, caught over a hundred fin whales in 2014, and exported a record quantity of 2071 tonnes in a single shipment in 2014. Since 2006, Hvalur has caught more than 500 fin whales and exported more than 5000 tonnes of whale meat to Japan.[179] The International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) estimates that 991 fin whales have been killed by Icelandic whaling company Hvalur since their return to hunting fin whales in 2009.[180] Icelandic Minister of Fisheries and Agriculture Svand\u00eds Svavarsd\u00f3ttir instituted a ban on Icelandic whaling from mid-June to August 31, 2023; however, whaling has since resumed following the expiration of the temporary ban.[181] The resumption of whaling in Iceland has been met with local and international outcry, including True North, an Icelandic film company. The production company filed an injunction against Hvalur following a statement signed by 67 actors, directors, authors from the international film community, condemning the practice and pledging to boycott Icelandic projects if the whaling continues.[182]\n\n\nIn the Southern Hemisphere, Japan permitted annual takes of 10 fin whales under its Antarctic Special Permit whaling program for the 2005\u20132006 and 2006\u20132007 seasons.[183] The proposal for 2007\u20132008 and the subsequent 12 seasons allowed takes of 50 per year.[13] While 10 fin whales were caught in the 2005\u201306 season and three in the 2006\u201307 season, none were caught in the 2007\u20132008 season. A single fin whale was caught in both the 2008\u201309 and 2009\u201310 seasons, two were taken in the 2010\u201311 season, and one was taken in the 2011\u201312 season.[184] In 2019, Japan left the International Whaling Commission (IWC) and resumed commercial whaling. Japan reported a catch of 212 total whales in both 2020 and 2021; however, no fin whale catches have yet been reported.[185]\n\n\nFin whales have been targets of illegal captures using harpoons for dolphin hunts or intentionally drive whales into nets.[38]\n\n\n\n### Ship interaction[edit]\n\n\nCollisions with ships are a major cause of mortality. In some areas, they cause a substantial portion of large whale strandings. Most serious injuries are caused by large, fast-moving ships over or near continental shelves.[186]\n\n\nA 60-foot-long fin whale was found stuck on the bow of a container ship in New York harbour on 12 April 2014.[187]\n\n\nTwo dead fin whales, one 65 feet and one 25 feet, were discovered stuck to the Australian destroyer HMAS\u00a0*Sydney* in May 2021 when the ship arrived in Naval Base San Diego.[188]\n\n\nShip collisions frequently occur in Tsushima Strait and result in damage done to whales, passengers, and vessels. In response the Japanese Coast Guard has started a surveillance program to monitor large cetacean activity in Tsushima Strait to inform operating vessels in the area.[189]\n\n\n\n### Museums[edit]\n\n\nSeveral fin whale skeletons are exhibited in North America. The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County in Los Angeles, California has an exhibit entitled the \"Fin Whale Passage\", which displays a 19.2\u00a0m (63\u00a0ft) fin whale skeleton collected by former museum osteologist Eugene Fischer and field collector Howard Hill in 1926 from the Trinidad whaling station (1920\u20131926) in Humboldt County, northern California. A steel armature supports the skeleton, which is accompanied by sculpted flukes.[190] Science North, a science museum in Greater Sudbury, Ontario, Canada, has a 20\u00a0m (66\u00a0ft) fin whale skeleton collected from Anticosti Island hanging from the fourth floor of its main building.[191] A 55\u00a0ft (17\u00a0m) skeleton hangs in the atrium (renovated in 2019\u20132020) of the science-mathematics building at Knox College (Illinois) in Galesburg, Illinois.[192] Perhaps the largest fin whale skeleton exhibited is at The Grand Rapids Public Museum in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where a 76\u00a0ft (23.2\u00a0m) skeleton in the Galleria section hangs from the ceiling.[193] Several fin whale skeletons are also exhibited in Europe. The Natural History Museum of Slovenia in Ljubljana, Slovenia, houses a 13\u00a0m (43\u00a0ft) female fin whale skeleton\u2014the specimen had been found floating in the Gulf of Piran in the spring of 2003.[194] The Hungarian Natural History Museum in Budapest, Hungary, displays a fin whale skeleton hanging near its main entrance which had been caught in the Atlantic Ocean in 1896 and purchased from Vienna in 1900.[195] The Cambridge University Museum of Zoology, in Cambridge, United Kingdom, exhibits a nearly 21\u00a0m (69\u00a0ft) male fin whale skeleton, which had stranded at Pevensey, East Sussex, in November 1865.[196]\n\n\nThe Otago Museum, in Dunedin, New Zealand, displays a 16.76\u00a0m (55.0\u00a0ft) fin whale skeleton, which had stranded on the beach at Nelson at the entrance of the Waimea River in 1882.[197]\n\n\nA 20\u00a0m fin whale skeleton is exhibited at Van Thuy Tu Temple in Phan Thi\u1ebft, Vietnam, where some local fishermen worship whales as near-divine beings who offer protection from storms.[198][199]\n\n\n\n* ![An 18.8\u00a0m (62\u00a0ft) fin whale skeleton at the Oceanographic Museum in Monaco](image)\n\nAn 18.8\u00a0m (62\u00a0ft) fin whale skeleton at the Oceanographic Museum in Monaco\n* Fin whale skeleton, Museum of Zoology Cambridge\n* ![Fin whale skeleton at the Van Thuy Tu Temple](image)\n\nFin whale skeleton at the Van Thuy Tu Temple\n\n\n### Whale watching[edit]\n\n\n![](image)People in a zodiac watching several fin whales off Tadoussac\nFin whales are regularly encountered on whale-watching excursions worldwide. In Monterey Bay and the Southern California Bight, fin whales are encountered year-round, with the best sightings between November and March. They can even be seen from land (for example, from Point Vicente, Palos Verdes, where they can be seen lunge feeding at the surface only a half mile to a few miles offshore). They are regularly sighted in the summer and fall in the Gulf of St. Lawrence,[200] the Gulf of Maine, the Bay of Fundy, the Bay of Biscay, Strait of Gibraltar, and the Mediterranean. In southern Ireland, they are seen inshore from June to February, with peak sightings in November and December.[201]\n\n\n\n## Conservation[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**. You can help by adding to it. *(March 2022)*\n |\n\n\n![](image)An immature fin whale in distress off national park of Caesarea Maritima\nThe fin whale is listed on both Appendix I and Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS).[202]\n\n\nIn addition, the fin whale is covered by the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area (ACCOBAMS) and the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (Pacific Cetaceans MOU).[203]\n\n\nWhaling poses a significant threat to population abundance. In the mid-20th century, whaling caused a massive decline in fin whale numbers. They are also threatened by vessel collisions, particularly in the Mediterranean Sea where collisions comprise a large part of fin whale mortalities. In the Mediterranean Sea, fin whales and other macro marine fauna are protected and observed under the Fixed Line Transect Mediterranean monitoring Network (FLT Med Net), an international monitoring program that tracks species movements in comparison to maritime traffic and marine litter to manage potential threats.[204] Fin whales occasionally get killed from entanglement and sometimes fishing gear.[*citation needed*] Military sonar can be problematic for fin whales and the way they communicate during the breeding season, possibly causing a decrease in birth rates.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe International Whaling Commission has set a zero limit for fin whale catches in the North Pacific and southern hemisphere since 1976.[205]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Baleen whale\n* Endangered species\n* List of cetaceans\n\n\nPortals:* ![](image) Cetaceans\n* ![icon](image) Mammals\n* ![](image) Marine life\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Mead, J.

It is the only baleen whale endemic to the Arctic and subarctic waters, and is named after its characteristic massive triangular skull, which it uses to break through Arctic ice. Other common names of the species included the **Greenland right whale**, **Arctic whale**, **steeple-top**, and **polar whale**.[5]\n\n\nBowheads have the largest mouth of any animal[6] representing almost one-third of the length of the body, the longest baleen plates with a maximum length of 4 metres (13 feet)[7] and may be the longest-lived mammals, with the ability to reach an age of more than 200 years.[8]\n\n\nThe bowhead was an early whaling target. Their population was severely reduced before a 1966 moratorium was passed to protect the species. Of the five stocks of bowhead populations, three are listed as \"endangered\", one as \"vulnerable\", and one as \"lower risk, conservation dependent\" according to the IUCN Red List. The global population is assessed as of least concern.[3][9]\n\n\n\n\n## Taxonomy[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Evolution of cetaceans\n\nCarl Linnaeus named this species in the tenth edition of his *Systema Naturae* (1758).[10] It was seemingly identical to its relatives in the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and Southern Oceans, and as such they were all thought to be a single species, collectively known as the \"right whale\", and given the binomial name *Balaena mysticetus*.\n\n\nToday, the bowhead whale occupies a monotypic genus, separate from the right whales, as proposed by the work of John Edward Gray in 1821.[11]\nFor the next 180\u00a0years, the family Balaenidae was the subject of great taxonometric debate. Authorities have repeatedly recategorized the three populations of right whale plus the bowhead whale, as one, two, three or four species, either in a single genus or in two separate genera. Eventually, it was recognized that bowheads and right whales were different, but there was still no strong consensus as to whether they shared a single genus or two. As recently as 1998, Dale Rice listed just two species \u2013 *B.\u00a0glacialis* (the right whales) and *B.\u00a0mysticetus* (the bowheads) \u2013 in his comprehensive and otherwise authoritative classification.[12]\n\n\nStudies in the 2000s finally provided clear evidence that the three living right whale species comprise a phylogenetic lineage, distinct from the bowhead, and that the bowhead and the right whales are rightly classified into two separate genera.[13]\nThe right whales were thus confirmed to be in a separate genus, *Eubalaena*. The relationship is shown in the cladogram below:\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Family Balaenidae\n |\n| |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Balaenidae | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| *Eubalaena* | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | \u00a0*E. glacialis* \u00a0 (North Atlantic right whale)\n |\n|  |\n|  | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | \u00a0*E. japonica* \u00a0 (North Pacific right whale)\n |\n|  |\n|  | \u00a0*E. australis* \u00a0 (Southern right whale)\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n| \u00a0\u00a0(right\u00a0whales)\u00a0\u00a0\n |\n| ***Balaena***\n | \u00a0***B. mysticetus* \u00a0 (bowhead whale)**\n |\n| (bowhead whales)\n |\n |\n|  |\n |\n| The bowhead whale, genus *Balaena*, in the family Balaenidae (extant taxa only)[14] |\n\n\n\nThe earlier fossil record shows no related cetacean after *Morenocetus*, found in a South American deposit dating back 23\u00a0million years.\n\n\nAn unknown species of right whale, the so-called \"Swedenborg whale\", which was proposed by Emanuel Swedenborg in the 18th\u00a0century, was once thought to be a North Atlantic right whale. Based on later DNA analysis, those fossil bones claimed to be from Swedenborg whales were confirmed to be from bowhead whales.[15]\n\n\n\n## Description[edit]\n\n\n![Drawing of long backbone, 13 ribs (two vestigial) large, curved upper and lower jawbones that occupy a third of the body, four multijointed \"fingers\" inside pectoral fin and connecting bone, enclosed in body outline](image)Skeleton of a bowhead whale\n![](image)Stamp showing drawing of mother and calf from Faroe Islands\nThe bowhead whale has a large, robust, dark-coloured body and a white chin. It has a massive triangular skull, which it uses to break through the Arctic ice to breathe. Inuit hunters have reported bowheads surfacing through 60\u00a0cm (24\u00a0in) of ice.[16] It also possesses a strongly bowed lower jaw and a narrow upper jaw. Its baleen is the longest of that of any whale, at 3\u00a0m (10\u00a0ft), and is used to strain tiny prey from the water. The bowhead whale has paired blowholes at the highest point of the head, which can spout a blow 6.1\u00a0m (20\u00a0ft 0\u00a0in) high. The bowhead's blubber is the thickest of any animal's, with a maximum of 43\u201350\u00a0cm (17\u201319+1\u20442\u00a0in).[17] Unlike most cetaceans, the bowhead does not have a dorsal fin\u2014an adaptation for spending much time under sea-surface ice.[18] Like the sperm whale and other cetaceans, the bowhead whale has a vestigial pelvis that is not connected to the spine.\n\n\nBowhead whales are comparable in size to the three species of right whales. According to whaling captain William Scoresby Jr., the longest bowhead he measured was 17.7\u00a0m (58\u00a0ft 1\u00a0in) long, while the longest measurement he had ever heard of was of a 20.4\u00a0m (66\u00a0ft 11\u00a0in) whale caught at Godhavn, Greenland, in early 1813. He also spoke of one, caught near Spitsbergen around 1800, that was allegedly nearly 21.3\u00a0m (69\u00a0ft 11\u00a0in) long.[19] In 1850, an American vessel claimed to have caught a 24.54\u00a0m (80\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in) individual in the Western Arctic.[20] Whether these lengths were actually measured is questionable. The longest reliably measured were a male of 16.2\u00a0m (53\u00a0ft 2\u00a0in) and a female of 18\u00a0m (59\u00a0ft), both landed in Alaska.[21] On average, female bowheads are larger than males. The adults would have likely measured 19 metres (62\u00a0ft) in length and 80 metric tons (88 short tons) in body mass, but larger individuals (like the one claimed in 1850) may weigh up to 100 metric tons (110 short tons).[22]\n\n\nAnalysis of hundreds of DNA samples from living whales and from baleen used in vessels, toys, and housing material has shown that Arctic bowhead whales have lost a significant portion of their genetic diversity in the past 500 years. Bowheads originally crossed ice-covered inlets and straits to exchange genes between Atlantic and Pacific populations. This conclusion was derived from analyzing maternal lineage using mitochondrial DNA. Whaling and climatic cooling during the Little Ice Age, from the 16th century to the 19th, is supposed to have reduced the whales' summer habitats, which explains the loss of genetic diversity.[23]\n\n\nA 2013 discovery has clarified the function of the bowhead's large palatal retial organ. The bulbous ridge of highly vascularized tissue, the corpus cavernosum maxillaris, extends along the centre of the hard plate, forming two large lobes at the rostral palate. The tissue is histologically similar to that of the corpus cavernosum of the mammalian penis. This organ is thought to provide a mechanism of cooling for the whale (which is normally protected from the cold Arctic waters by 40\u00a0cm or 16\u00a0in or more of fat). During physical exertion, the whale must cool itself to prevent hyperthermia (and ultimately brain damage). This organ becomes engorged with blood, and as the whale opens its mouth cold seawater flows over the organ, thus cooling the blood.[24]\n\n\n\n## Behaviour[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Resting on water surface in Foxe Basin\n![](image)Breaching off Alaskan coast\n### Swimming[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Whale surfacing behaviour\n\nThe bowhead whale is not a social animal, typically travelling alone or in small pods of up to six. It is able to dive and remain submerged under water for up to an hour. The time spent under water in a single dive is usually limited to 9\u201318 minutes.[16] The bowhead is not thought to be a deep diver, but can reach a depth down to 150\u00a0m (500\u00a0ft). It is a slow swimmer, normally travelling around 2\u20135\u00a0km/h (1\u20133\u00a0mph) [0.55\u20131.39\u00a0m/s].[25] When fleeing from danger, it can travel at a speed of 10\u00a0km/h (6.2\u00a0mph) [2.78\u00a0m/s (9\u00a0ft/s)]. During periods of feeding, the average swim speed is increased to 1.1\u20132.5\u00a0m/s (4.0\u20139.0\u00a0km/h).[26]\n\n\n\n### Feeding[edit]\n\n\nThe head of the bowhead whale comprises a third of its body length, creating an enormous feeding apparatus.[26] The bowhead whale is a filter feeder, and feeds by swimming forward with its mouth wide open.[16] It has hundreds of overlapping baleen plates consisting of keratin hanging from each side of the upper jaw. The mouth has a large, upturning lip on the lower jaw that helps to reinforce and hold the baleen plates within the mouth. This also prevents buckling or breakage of the plates from the pressure of the water passing through them as the whale advances. To feed, water is filtered through the fine hairs of keratin of the baleen plates, trapping the prey inside near the tongue where it is then swallowed.[27] The diet consists of mostly zooplankton, which includes krill, copepods, mysids, amphipods, and many other crustaceans.[26][28] About 1.8 tonnes (2 short tons) of food are consumed each day.[27] While foraging, bowheads are solitary or occur in groups of two to 10 or more.[17]\n\n\n\n### Vocalization[edit]\n\n\nBowhead whales are highly vocal[29] and use low frequency (<1000\u00a0Hz) sounds to communicate while travelling, feeding, and socialising. Intense calls for communication and navigation are produced especially during migration season. During breeding season, bowheads make long, complex, variable songs for mating calls.[25] From 2010 through to 2014, near Greenland, 184 distinct songs were recorded from a population of around 300 animals.[30]\n\n\n\n### Reproduction[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Whale reproduction\n\nSexual activity occurs between pairs and in boisterous groups of several males and one or two females. Breeding season is observed from March through August; conception is believed to occur primarily in March when song activity is at its highest.[25] Reproduction can begin when a whale is 10 to 15 years old. The gestation period is 13\u201314 months with females producing a calf once every three to four years.[21] Lactation typically lasts about a year. To survive in the cold water immediately after birth, calves are born with a thick layer of blubber. Within 30 minutes of birth, bowhead calves are able to swim on their own. A newborn calf is typically 4\u20134.5\u00a0m (13\u201315\u00a0ft) long, weighs roughly 1,000\u00a0kg (2,200\u00a0lb), and grows to 8.2\u00a0m (26\u00a0ft 11\u00a0in) within the first year.[21]\n\n\n\n## Health[edit]\n\n\n### Lifespan[edit]\n\n\nBowhead whales are considered to be the longest-living mammals, living for over 200 years.[31] In May 2007, a 15\u00a0m (49\u00a0ft) specimen caught off the Alaskan coast was discovered with the 90\u00a0mm (3.5\u00a0in) head of an explosive bomb lance of a model manufactured between 1879 and 1885, so the whale was probably bomb lanced sometime between those years, and its age at the time of death was estimated at between 115 and 130 years.[32] Spurred by this discovery, scientists measured the ages of other bowhead whales; one specimen was estimated to be 211 years old.[33] Other bowhead whales were estimated to be between 135 and 172 years old. This discovery showed the longevity of the bowhead whale is much greater than originally thought.[34] Researchers at CSIRO, Australia's national science agency, estimated that bowhead whales' maximum natural lifespan is 268 years based on genetic analysis.[35]\n\n\n\n### Genetic benefits[edit]\n\n\nA greater number of cells present in an organism was once believed to result in greater chances of mutations that cause age-related diseases and cancer.[36] Although the bowhead whale has thousands of times more cells than other mammals, it has a much higher resistance to cancer and aging. In 2015, scientists from the US and UK were able to successfully map the whale's genome.[37] Through comparative analysis, two alleles that could be responsible for the whale's longevity were identified. These two specific gene mutations linked to the bowhead whale's ability to live longer are the *ERCC1* gene and the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (*PCNA*) gene. *ERCC1* is linked to DNA repair and increased cancer resistance. *PCNA* is also important in DNA repair. These mutations enable bowhead whales to better repair DNA damage, allowing for greater resistance to cancer.[36] The whale's genome may also reveal physiological adaptations such as having low metabolic rates compared to other mammals.[38] Changes in the gene *UCP1*, a gene involved in thermoregulation, can explain differences in the metabolic rates in cells.\n\n\n\n## Ecology[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Drawing of an adult in 1884\n### Range and habitat[edit]\n\n\nThe bowhead whale is the only baleen whale to spend its entire life in the Arctic and subarctic waters.[39] The Alaskan population spends the winter months in the southwestern Bering Sea. The group migrates northward in the spring, following openings in the ice, into the Chukchi and Beaufort seas.[40] The whale's range varies depending on climate changes and on the forming/melting of ice.[41]\n\n\nHistorically, bowhead whales' range may have been broader and more southerly than currently thought. Bowheads were abundant around Labrador, Newfoundland (Strait of Belle Isle) and the northern Gulf of St Lawrence until at least the 16th and 17th centuries. It is unclear whether this was due to the colder climate during these periods.[42] Distributions of *Balaena* spp. during the Pleistocene were far more southerly as fossils have been excavated from Italy and North Carolina, thus could have overlapped between those of *Eubalaena* based on those locations.[43]\n\n\n\n### Population[edit]\n\n\nGenerally, five stocks of bowhead whales are recognized: 1) the Western Arctic stock in the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort Seas, 2) the Hudson Bay and Foxe Basin stock, 3) the Baffin Bay and Davis Strait stock, 4) the Sea of Okhotsk stock, and 5) the Svalbard-Barents Sea stock. However, recent evidence suggests that the Hudson Bay and Foxe Basin stock and the Baffin Bay and Davis Strait stock should be considered one stock based on genetics and movements of tagged whales.[44]\n\n\n\n#### Western Arctic[edit]\n\n\nThe Western Arctic bowhead population, also known as the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort population, has recovered since the commercial harvest of this stock ceased in the early 1900s. A 2019 study estimated that the Western Arctic population was 12,505; although it was lower than the 2011 value of 16,820, the surveyors believed there was no significant decline in 2011-2019 due to the unusual conditions of whale migration and observation in 2019.[45] The yearly growth rate of the Western Arctic bowhead population was 3.7% from 1978 to 2011. These data suggest that the Western Arctic bowhead stock may be near its precommercial whaling level.[44] Migration patterns of this population are being affected by climate change.[46]\n\n\nAlaskan Natives continue to hunt small numbers of bowhead whales for subsistence purposes. The Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission co-manages the bowhead subsistence harvest with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The Alaskan villages that participate in the bowhead subsistence harvest include Barrow, Point Hope, Point Lay, Wainwright, Nuiqsut, Kaktovik, Gambell, Savoonga, Kivalina, Wales, and Little Diomede.[47] The annual subsistence harvest of the Western Arctic stock has ranged from 14 to 72, amounting to an estimated 0.1-0.5% of the population.[44]\n\n\n\n#### Baffin Bay and Davis Strait[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2008, Canada's Department of Fisheries and Oceans stated the previous estimates in the eastern Arctic had undercounted, with a new estimate of 14,400 animals (range 4,800\u201343,000).[48] These larger numbers correspond to prewhaling estimates, indicating the population has fully recovered. However, if climate change substantially shrinks sea ice, these whales could be threatened by increased shipping traffic.[49]\n\n\nThe status of other populations is less well known. About 1,200 were off West Greenland in 2006, while the Svalbard population may only number in the tens. However, the numbers have been increasing in recent years.[50]\n\n\n\n#### Hudson Bay and Foxe Basin[edit]\n\n\nThe Hudson Bay \u2013 Foxe Basin population is distinct from the Baffin Bay\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Davis Strait group.[51] The original population size of this local group is unclear, but possibly about 500 to 600 whales annually summered in the northwestern part of the bay in the 1860s.[52] It is likely that the number of whales that actually inhabit Hudson Bay is much smaller than the total population size of this group,[53] but reports from local indigenous people indicate that this population is increasing over decades.[54] Larger portions of the bay are used for summering, while wintering is on a smaller scale. Some animals winter in Hudson Strait, most notably north of Igloolik Island and north eastern Hudson Bay. Distribution patterns in these regions are affected by the presence of killer whales, and bowheads can disappear from normal ranges in the presence of atypical numbers of orcas. Increased mortality caused by killer whale attack is a possible outcome of climate change, as reduced ice coverage is expected to result in fewer areas that the bowheads can use for shelter from attack.[54] Whaling grounds in the 19th century stretched from Marble Island to Roes Welcome Sound and to\nLyon Inlet and Fisher Strait, and whales still migrate through most of these areas.\n\n\nDistribution within Hudson Bay is mostly restricted to the northwestern part[51] along with Wager Bay,[55] Repulse Bay,[56] Southampton Island (one of two main know summering areas),[56][57] Frozen Strait, northern Foxe\nBasin, and north of Igloolik in summer.[54] Satellite tracking[58] indicates that some portions of the group within the bay do not venture further south than Whale Cove[56] and areas south of Coats and Mansel Islands.[*citation needed*] Cow \u2013 calf pairs and juveniles up to 13.5\u00a0m (44\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in) in length make up the majority of summering aggregation in the northern Foxe Basin, while matured males and noncalving females may use the northwestern part of Hudson Bay.[54] Fewer whales also migrate to the west coast of Hudson Bay and Mansel and Ottawa Islands.[54] Bowhead ranges within Hudson Bay are usually considered not to cover southern parts,[53][59] but at least some whales migrate to locations further south such as Sanikiluaq[*citation needed*] and Churchill river mouth.[60][61][62]\n\n\nCongregation within Foxe Basin occurs in a well-defined area of 3,700\u00a0km2 (1,100\u00a0sq\u00a0nmi) north of Igloolik Island to Fury and Hecla Strait and Kapuiviit and Gifford Fiord, and into Gulf of Boothia and Prince Regent Inlet. Northward migrating along western Foxe Basin to eastern side of the basin also occurs in spring.[54]\n\n\n\n![](image)Whale spyhops in Ulbansky Bay, northwestern Okhotsk Sea[63]\n#### Sea of Okhotsk[edit]\n\n\nNot much is known about the endangered Sea of Okhotsk population. To learn more about the population, these mammals have been regularly observed near the Shantar Islands, very close to the shore, such as at Ongachan Bay.[64][65] Several companies provide whale-watching services, which are mostly land-based. According to Russian scientists, this total population likely does not exceed 400 animals.[63] Scientific research on this population was seldom done before 2009, when researchers studying belugas noticed concentrations of bowheads in the study area. Thus, bowheads in the Sea of Okhotsk were once called \"forgotten whales\" by researchers. The WWF welcomed the creation of a nature sanctuary in the region[66]\n\n\nPossibly, vagrants from this population occasionally reach into Asian nations such as off Japan or the Korean Peninsula (although this record might be of a right whale[67]). The first documented report of the species in Japanese waters was of a strayed infant (7\u00a0m or 23\u00a0ft) caught in Osaka Bay on 23 June 1969,[68] and the first living sighting was of a 10\u00a0m (33\u00a0ft) juvenile around Shiretoko Peninsula (the southernmost of ice floe range in the Northern Hemisphere) on 21 to 23 June 2015.[69] Fossils have been excavated on Hokkaido,[70] but it is unclear whether the northern coasts of Japan were once included in seasonal or occasional migration ranges.\n\n\nGenetic studies suggest Okhotsk population share common ancestry with whales in Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Seas, and repeated mixings had occurred between whales in the two seas.[71]\n\n\n\n#### Svalbard-Barents Sea[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Russian Arctic National Park\n\nThe most endangered but historically largest of all bowhead populations is the Svalbard/Spitsbergen population.[72] Occurring normally in Fram Strait,[73] Barents Sea and Severnaya Zemlya along Kara Sea[50] to Laptev Sea and East Siberian Sea regions, these whales were seen in entire coastal regions in European and Russian Arctic, even reaching to Icelandic and Scandinavian coasts and Jan Mayen in Greenland Sea, and west of Cape Farewell and western Greenland coasts.[74] Also, bowheads in this stock were possibly once abundant in areas adjacent to the White Sea region, where few or no animals currently migrate, such as the Kola and Kanin Peninsula. Today, the number of sightings elsewhere is very small,[75] but with increasing regularities[76] with whales having strong regional connections.[77] Whales have also started approaching townships and inhabited areas such as around Longyearbyen.[78] The waters around the marine mammal sanctuary[79] of Franz Josef Land is possibly functioning as the most important habitat for this population.[80][81]\n\n\nIt is unclear whether this population is a remnant of the historic Svalbard group, recolonized individuals from other stocks, or if a mixing of these two or more stocks has taken place. In 2015, discoveries of the refuge along eastern Greenland where whaling ships could not reach due to ice floes[82] and largest numbers of whales (80\u2013100 individuals) ever sighted between Spitsbergen and Greenland[83] indicate that more whales than previously considered survived whaling periods, and flows from the other populations are possible.\n\n\n\n#### Possible moulting area off Baffin Island[edit]\n\n\nDuring expeditions by a tour operator 'Arctic Kingdom', a large group of bowheads seemingly involved in courtship activities was discovered in very shallow bays south of Qikiqtarjuaq in 2012.[84] Floating skins and rubbing behaviours at sea bottom indicated possible moulting had taken place. Moulting behaviours had never or seldom been documented for this species before. This area is an important habitat for whales that were observed to be relatively active and to interact with humans positively, or to rest on sea floors. These whales belong to Davis Strait stock.\n\n\nIsabella Bay in Niginganiq National Wildlife Area is the first wildlife sanctuary in the world to be designed specially for bowhead whales. However, moultings have not been recorded in this area due to environmental factors.[85]\n\n\n\n### Predation[edit]\n\n\nIn 1978 the International Whaling Commission (IWC) introduced a hunting strike quota for the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Sea (BCB) bowhead.[86] The quota has remained at 67 strikes per year since 1998 and represents about 0.5 percent of BCB population.[86] The population of bowheads in West Greenland and Canada is estimated to be 6,000 and rising, and hunts in this are minimal (<0.001 percent).[86] Both stocks are rising, and the indigenous hunts seem to be self-sustaining.[86]\n\n\nKiller whales are also known predators.[87] There is no consensus on the number of deaths by killer whales.[86] Bowheads seek the ice and shallow waters' safety when threatened by killer whales.[25] The Inuit have a traditional word for this behavior to give historical context that this is not a new phenomenon.[86] Global warming is increasing the frequency that killer whales are observed in the far north. A once-rare event, killer whales are now seen more frequently.[86]\n\n\nThere are no reports of attacks on bowheads by sharks.[86]\n\n\n\n## Whaling[edit]\n\n\n![Two whaleboats beached in foreground, five rowed and four sailing whaleboats chasing/attacking five whales, two larger whaling ships nearby, and sun peeking around snow-covered mountain in background](image)Eighteenth-century engraving showing Dutch whalers hunting bowhead whales in the Arctic\nThe bowhead whale has been hunted for blubber, meat, oil, bones, and baleen. Like the right whale, it swims slowly, and floats after death, making it ideal for whaling.[88] Before commercial whaling, they were estimated to number 50,000.[89] Paleo-Eskimo sites indicate bowhead whales were eaten in sites from perhaps 4000 BC. Inuit people near the Pacific developed specific hunting tools, with the whales providing food and fuel.[90]\n\n\nCommercial bowhead whaling began in the 16th century when the Basques killed them as they migrated south through the Strait of Belle Isle in the fall and early winter. In 1611, the first whaling expedition sailed to Spitsbergen. The whaling settlement Smeerenburg was founded on Spitsbergen in 1619. By midcentury, the population(s) there had practically been wiped out, forcing whalers to voyage into the \"West Ice\"\u2014the pack ice off Greenland's east coast. By 1719, they had reached the Davis Strait, and by the first quarter of the 19th century, Baffin Bay.[91]\n\n\n\n![](image)*The Chase of the Bowhead Whale* (1909) by Clifford Warren Ashley.\nIn the North Pacific, the first bowheads were taken off the eastern coast of Kamchatka by the Danish whaleship *Neptun*, Captain Thomas Sodring, in 1845.[20] In 1847, the first bowheads were caught in the Sea of Okhotsk, and the following year, Captain Thomas Welcome Roys, in the bark *Superior*, of Sag Harbor, caught the first bowheads in the Bering Strait region. By 1849, 50 ships were hunting bowheads in each area; in the Bering Strait, 500 whales were killed that year, and that number jumped to more than 2000 in 1850.[92] By 1852, 220 ships were cruising around the Bering Strait region, which killed over 2,600 whales. Between 1854 and 1857, the fleet shifted to the Sea of Okhotsk, where 100\u2013160 ships cruised annually. During 1858\u20131860, the ships shifted back to the Bering Strait region, where the majority of the fleet cruised during the summer until the early 20th century.[93] An estimated 18,600 bowheads were killed in the Bering Strait region between 1848 and 1914, with 60% of the total being reached within the first two decades. An estimated 18,000 bowheads were killed in the Sea of Okhotsk during 1847\u20131867, 80% in the first decade.[94]\n\n\nBowheads were first taken along the pack ice in the northeastern Sea of Okhotsk, then in Tausk Bay and Northeast Gulf (Shelikhov Gulf). Soon, ships expanded to the west, catching them around Iony Island and then around the Shantar Islands. In the Western Arctic, they mainly caught them in the Anadyr Gulf, the Bering Strait, and around St. Lawrence Island. They later spread to the western Beaufort Sea (1854) and the Mackenzie River delta (1889).[93]\n\n\n\n![](image)Inuit woman and child standing on bowhead whale after a 2002 subsistence hunt\nCommercial whaling, the principal cause of the population decline, is over. Bowhead whales are now hunted on a subsistence level by native peoples of North America.[95]\n\n\n\n### Alaskan subsistence[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Subsistence hunting of the bowhead whale\n\nSee also: Aboriginal whaling\n\nSome Alaska Natives continue by tradition to hunt bowhead and beluga whales on a subsistence level, with low annual bowhead total quotas set by the International Whaling Commission in conjunction with individual village limits set by the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission.[96]\n\n\nBowhead hunting is limited to whaling crews who are:[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n* I\u00f1upiat\n* St Lawrence Island Siberian Yupik\n\n\nThis bowhead subsistence hunting occurs during the northward spring migrations based from the ice and from small boats during the returning fall migrations.[97]\n\n\n\n## Conservation[edit]\n\n\nThe bowhead is listed in Appendix I by CITES. While the global population is thought to be secure, thus assigned \"least concern\" status,[3] some populations are listed by the National Marine Fisheries Service as \"endangered\" under the auspices of the United States' Endangered Species Act. The IUCN Red List data are:[88]\n\n\n\n* Svalbard population \u2013 critically endangered\n* Sea of Okhotsk subpopulation \u2013 endangered\n* Baffin Bay-Davis Strait stock \u2013 endangered\n* Hudson Bay-Foxe Basin stock \u2013 vulnerable (estimated to be 1,026 individuals in 2005 by DFO)[98]\n* Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort stock \u2013 lower risk \u2013 conservation dependent\n\n\nThe Alaska Department of Fish and Game and the USA government list the bowhead whale as federally endangered.[99]\n\n\nThe bowhead whale is listed in Appendix I[100] of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS), as this species has been categorized as being in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant proportion of its range. CMS Parties strive towards strictly protecting these animals, conserving or restoring the places where they live, mitigating obstacles to migration, and controlling other factors that might endanger them.[88]\n\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![Whales swimming in the Lindholm Strait of the Shantar Islands, in the northwestern Sea of Okhotsk[101]](image)\n\nWhales swimming in the Lindholm Strait of the Shantar Islands, in the northwestern Sea of Okhotsk[101]\n* ![Cavorting whale in northwestern part of Sea of Okhotsk[63]](image)\n\nCavorting whale in northwestern part of Sea of Okhotsk[63]\n* ![Blowholes](image)\n\nBlowholes\n* ![Resting in Foxe Basin](image)\n\nResting in Foxe Basin\n* ![Fluke up before diving](image)\n\nFluke up before diving\n* ![Whale showing one of pectoral fins](image)\n\nWhale showing one of pectoral fins\n* ![Tip of whitish chin visible](image)\n\nTip of whitish chin visible\n* ![Map of the bowhead whale ranges centered over the North Pole](image)\n\nMap of the bowhead whale ranges centered over the North Pole\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Cetaceans portal\n* ![icon](image)Mammals portal\n* ![](image)Marine life portal\n\n\n* List of cetaceans\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Mead, J.

          "content": "<document>\n<title>Largest and heaviest animals</title>\n<content>\nThe **largest animal** currently alive is the blue whale. The maximum recorded weight was 190 tonnes for a specimen measuring 27.6 metres (91\u00a0ft), whereas longer ones, up to 33.6 metres (110\u00a0ft), have been recorded but not weighed.[1][2][3] It is estimated, this individual could have a mass of 250 tonnes.[4][5] The longest non-colonial animal is the lion's mane jellyfish (36.6m / 120\u00a0ft).[6]\n\n\nIn 2023, paleontologists estimated that the extinct whale *Perucetus*, discovered in Peru, may have outweighed the blue whale, with a mass of 85-340 t (84-335 long tons; 94-375 short tonnes.)[7] While controversial, estimates for the weight of the sauropod *Bruhathkayosaurus* suggest it was around 110-170 tons, with the highest estimate being 240 tons, if scaled with *Patagotitan*, although actual fossil remains no longer exist, and that estimation is based on described dimensions in 1987.[8] The upper estimates of weight for these two prehistoric animals would have easily rivaled or exceeded the blue whale. \n\n\nThe African bush elephant (*Loxodonta africana*) is the largest living land animal. A native of various open habitats in sub-Saharan Africa, males weigh about 6.0 tonnes (13,200\u00a0lb) on average.[9] The largest elephant ever recorded was shot in Angola in 1974. It was a male measuring 10.67 metres (35.0\u00a0ft) from trunk to tail and 4.17 metres (13.7\u00a0ft) lying on its side in a projected line from the highest point of the shoulder, to the base of the forefoot, indicating a standing shoulder height of 3.96 metres (13.0\u00a0ft). This male had a computed weight of 10.4 tonnes.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## Heaviest living animals[edit]\n\n\nThe heaviest living animals are all whales.

At the highest estimates, this would make *Perucetus* the heaviest known animal in history.[7]\n\n\nThe largest land mammal extant today is the African bush elephant. The largest extinct land mammal known was long considered to be *Paraceratherium orgosensis*, a rhinoceros relative thought to have stood up to 4.8\u00a0m (15.7\u00a0ft) tall, measured over 7.4\u00a0m (24.3\u00a0ft) long and may have weighed about 17 tonnes.[55][56] In 2015, a study suggested that one example of the proboscidean *Palaeoloxodon namadicus* may have been the largest land mammal ever, based on extensive research of fragmentary leg bone fossils from one individual, with a maximum estimated size of 22 tonnes.[57][55]\n\n\n\n### Stem-mammals (Synapsida)[edit]\n\n\nThe Late Triassic *Lisowicia bojani*, from what is now southern Poland, probably was the largest of all non-mammalian synapsids (most of which became extinct 250 million years ago), at 4.5\u00a0m (15\u00a0ft) in length, 2.6\u00a0m (8.5\u00a0ft) in height and 9\u00a0t (20,000\u00a0lb) in weight.[58] However, one study suggested a more conservative weight of 4.87 tonnes to 7.02 tonnes for the adult taxon, with an average body mass of 5.88 tonnes.[59] The largest carnivorous synapsid was *Anteosaurus* at 5\u20136\u00a0m (16\u201320\u00a0ft) and 500\u2013600\u00a0kg (1,100\u20131,300\u00a0lb).[60]\n\n\n\nCaseasaurs (Caseasauria)\nThe herbivorous *Alierasaurus* was the largest caseid and the largest amniote to have lived at the time, with an estimated length around 6\u20137\u00a0m (20\u201323\u00a0ft).[61] Another huge caseasaur is *Cotylorhynchus hancocki*, with an estimated length and weight of at least 6\u00a0m (20\u00a0ft)[62] and more than 500\u00a0kg (1,100\u00a0lb).[63]\nSphenacodontids (Sphenacodontidae)\nThe biggest carnivorous synapsid of Early Permian was *Dimetrodon*, which could reach 4.6\u00a0m (15\u00a0ft) and 250\u00a0kg (550\u00a0lb).[64] The largest members of the genus *Dimetrodon* were also the world's first fully terrestrial apex predators.[65]\nTappenosaurids (Tappenosauridae)\nThe Middle Permian *Tappenosaurus* was estimated at 5.5\u00a0m (18\u00a0ft) in length which is comparable in size with the largest dinocephalians.[66]\nTherapsids (Therapsida)\nThe plant-eating dicynodont *Lisowicia bojani* is the largest-known of all non-mammalian synapsids, at 4.5\u00a0m (15\u00a0ft) and 9,000\u00a0kg (20,000\u00a0lb).[58][67][68] The largest carnivorous therapsid was the aforementioned *Anteosaurus* from what is now South Africa during Middle Permian epoch. It reached 5\u20136\u00a0m (16\u201320\u00a0ft) long, and about 500\u2013600\u00a0kg (1,100\u20131,300\u00a0lb) in weight.[60]\n### Reptiles (Reptilia)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of largest reptiles\n\n![](image)The saltwater crocodile is the largest living reptile.\nThe largest living reptile, a representative of the order Crocodilia, is the saltwater crocodile (*Crocodylus porosus*) of Southern Asia and Australia, with adult males being typically 3.9\u20135.5\u00a0m (13\u201318\u00a0ft) long. The largest confirmed saltwater crocodile on record was 6.32\u00a0m (20.7\u00a0ft) long, and weighed about 1,360\u00a0kg (3,000\u00a0lb).[1] Unconfirmed reports of much larger crocodiles exist, but examinations of incomplete remains have never suggested a length greater than 7\u00a0m (23\u00a0ft).[69] Also, a living specimen estimated at 7\u00a0m (23\u00a0ft) and 2,000\u00a0kg (4,400\u00a0lb) has been accepted by the Guinness Book of World Records.[70] However, due to the difficulty of trapping and measuring a very large living crocodile, the accuracy of these dimensions has yet to be verified. A specimen named Lolong caught alive in the Philippines in 2011 (died February 2013) was found to have measured 6.17\u00a0m (20.2\u00a0ft) in length.[71][72][73][74][75]\n\n\nThe Komodo dragon (*Varanus komodoensis*), also known as the \"Komodo monitor\", is a large species of lizard found in the Indonesian islands of Komodo, Rinca, Flores, Gili Motang, Nusa kode and Padar. A member of the monitor lizard family (Varanidae), it is the largest living species of lizard, growing to a maximum length of more than 3 metres (9.8 feet) in rare cases and weighing up to approximately 166 kilograms (366 pounds).[76]\n\n\n\n#### Largest living reptiles[edit]\n\n\nThe following is a list of the largest living reptile species ranked by average weight, which is dominated by the crocodilians. Unlike mammals, birds, or fish, the mass of large reptiles is frequently poorly documented and many are subject to conjecture and estimation.[1]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Animal\n | Average mass[kg (lb)]\n | Maximum mass[kg (lb)]\n | Average total length[m (ft)]\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Saltwater crocodile | 450 (1,000)[77][78] | 2,000 (4,400)[79][80] | 4.5 (14.8)[77][81] |\n| 2 | Nile crocodile | 410 (900)[82] | 1,090 (2,400)[1] | 4.2 (13.8)[82] |\n| 3 | Orinoco crocodile | 380 (840)[*citation needed*] | 1,100 (2,400)[*citation needed*] | 4.1 (13.5)[83][84] |\n| 4 | Leatherback sea turtle | 364 (800)[85][86] | 932 (2,050)[1] | 2.0 (6.6)[1] |\n| 5 | American crocodile | 336 (740)[87] | 1,000 (2,200)[88] | 4.0 (13.1)[89][90] |\n| 6 | Black caiman | 300 (661)[*citation needed*] | 1,000 (2,200)[*citation needed*] | 3.9 (12.8)[91][92][93][94] |\n| 7 | Gharial | 250 (550)[95] | 1,000 (2,200)[96] | 4.5 (14.8)[95] |\n| 8 | American alligator | 240 (530)[97][98] | 1,000 (2,200)[1] | 3.4 (11.2)[98] |\n| 9 | Mugger crocodile | 225 (495)[97] | 700 (1,500)[99] | 3.3 (10.8)[98] |\n| 10 | False gharial | 210 (460)[100] | 590 (1,300)[101] | 4.0 (13.1)[102] |\n| 11 | Aldabra giant tortoise | 205 (450)[103] | 360 (790)[1] | 1.4 (4.6)[104] |\n| 12 | Loggerhead sea turtle | 200 (441)[*citation needed*] | 545 (1,202)[*citation needed*] | 0.95 (3.2)[104] |\n| 13 | Green sea turtle | 190 (418.9)[105] | 395 (870.8)[82] | 1.12 (3.67)[82] |\n| 14 | Slender-snouted crocodile | 180 (400)[106] | 325 (720)[106] | 3.3 (10.8)[106] |\n| 15 | Galapagos tortoise | 175 (390)[107] | 417 (919)[108] | 1.5 (4.9)[109] |\n\n\n### Dinosaurs (Dinosauria)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dinosaur size\n\nSee also: Largest prehistoric animals\n\n![](image)*Bruhathkayosaurus matleyi*, potentially the largest animal to have walked the earth.\n![](image)A human and the longest known dinosaurs of the five major clades.

The tallest and heaviest sauropod known from a complete skeleton is a specimen of an immature *Giraffatitan* discovered in Tanzania between 1907 and 1912, now mounted in the Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde of Berlin. It is 12\u201313.27\u00a0m (39.4\u201343.5\u00a0ft) tall and weighed 23.3\u201339.5 tonnes.[110][111][112][113][114][115] The longest is a 25\u00a0m (82\u00a0ft) long specimen of *Diplodocus* discovered in Wyoming, and mounted in Pittsburgh's Carnegie Natural History Museum in 1907. A *Patagotitan* specimen found in Argentina in 2014 is estimated to have been 37\u201340\u00a0m (121\u2013131\u00a0ft) long and 20\u00a0m (66\u00a0ft) tall, with a weight of 69\u201377 tonnes.[116][117]\nThere were larger sauropods, but they are known only from a few bones. The current record-holders include *Argentinosaurus*, which may have weighed 100 tonnes; *Supersaurus* which might have reached 34\u00a0m (112\u00a0ft) in length and *Sauroposeidon* which might have been 18\u00a0m (59\u00a0ft) tall. Some abnormal specimens such as specimen BYU 9024 of the *Barosaurus* genus could reach an astounding 45-48 meters long, with mass varying from the 'modest' 60-66 tons to the more immense 92-120 tons.[118][119][120] Two other such sauropods include *Bruhathkayosaurus* and *Maraapunisaurus*. Both are known only from fragments that are no longer exist. *Bruhathkayosaurus* might have been between 40\u201344\u00a0m (131\u2013144\u00a0ft) in length and 175\u2013220 tonnes in weight according to some estimates, with recent estimates being place between 110-170 tons.[121][8] *Maraapunisaurus* might have been approximately 35\u201340\u00a0m long and 80\u2013120 tonnes or more.[122] Each of these two 'super-sauropods' would have easily rivalled the largest blue whale in size.[8]\n\n\n| Rank\n | Animal\n | Average mass[tonnes]\n | Maximum mass[tonnes]\n | Average total length[m (ft)]\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Bruhathkayosaurus matleyi | 110-170[8] | 240[8] | 44.1 (144.6)[123][124] |\n| 2 | Maraapunisaurus fragillimus | 80-120[125] | 150[126] | 35-40 (115-131)[125] |\n| 3 | Barosaurus lentus BYU 9024 | 60-66[118][119][127][128] | 92-120[120] | 45-48 (148-157)[128] |\n| 4 | Argentinosaurus huinculensis | 75-80[113] | 100[113][129] | 35\u201339.7 (115\u2013130)[113][130] |\n| 5 | Mamenchisaurus | 50-80[131] | 80[131] | 26\u201335 (85\u2013115)[131] |\n| 6 | Notocolossus gonzalezparejasi | 44.9\u201375.9[129] | 75.9[129] | 28 (92)[129] |\n| 7 | Patagotitan mayorum | 55-69[132] | 77[132] | 33\u201337 (108\u2013121)[132] |\n| 8 | Puertasaurus reuili | 50-60[133] | 60 | 27-30 (89-98)[134][135][136] |\n| 9 | Sauroposeidon proteles | 40-60[137] | 60[137] | 27\u201334 (89\u2013112)[137][133][138] |\n| 10 | Dreadnoughtus schrani | 22.1\u201359.3[139] | 59.3[139] | 26 (85)[129][139] |\n\n\nTheropods (Theropoda)\nThe largest theropod known from a nearly complete skeleton is the most complete *Tyrannosaurus* *rex* specimen, nicknamed \"Sue\", which was discovered in South Dakota in 1990 and now mounted in the Field Museum of Chicago at a total length of 12.3\u00a0m (40\u00a0ft). Body mass estimates have reached over 9,500\u00a0kg,[140] though other figures, such as Hartman's 2013 estimate of 8,400\u00a0kg,[141] have been lower.\nAnother giant theropod is *Spinosaurus aegyptiacus* from the mid-Cretaceous of North Africa. Size estimates have been fluctuating far more over the years, with length estimates ranging from 12.6 to 18 m and mass estimates from 7 to 20.9 t.[142][143] Recent findings favor a length exceeding 15 m [144] and a body mass of 7.5 tons.[145]\nOther contenders known from partial skeletons include *Giganotosaurus carolinii* (est. 12.2\u201313.2 m and 6-13.8 tonnes) and *Carcharodontosaurus saharicus* (est. 12-13.3 m and 6.2-15.1 tonnes).[143][146][147][148][149][118]\nThe largest extant theropod is the common ostrich (see birds, below).\nArmored dinosaurs (Thyreophora)\nThe largest thyreophorans were *Ankylosaurus* and *Stegosaurus*, from the Late Cretaceous and Late Jurassic periods (respectively) of what is now North America, both measuring up to 9\u00a0m (30\u00a0ft) in length and estimated to weigh up to 6 tonnes.[150][151]\nOrnithopods (Ornithopoda)\nThe largest ornithopods were the hadrosaurids *Shantungosaurus*, a late Cretaceous dinosaur found in the Shandong Peninsula of China, and *Magnapaulia* from the late Cretaceous of North America. Both species are known from fragmentary remains but are estimated to have reached over 15\u00a0m (49\u00a0ft) in length[152][153] and were likely the heaviest non-sauropod dinosaurs, estimated at over 23\u00a0tonnes.[153]\nCeratopsians (Ceratopsia)\nThe largest ceratopsians were *Triceratops* and its ancestor *Eotriceratops* from the late Cretaceous of North America. Both estimated to have reached about 9\u00a0m (30\u00a0ft) in length[154] and weighed 12\u00a0tonnes.[155][156]\n#### Birds (Aves)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of largest birds\n\n![](image)The common ostrich is the largest living bird.\nThe largest living bird, a member of the Struthioniformes, is the common ostrich (*Struthio camelus*), from the plains of Africa. A large male ostrich can reach a height of 2.8\u00a0m (9.2\u00a0ft) and weigh over 156\u00a0kg (344\u00a0lb).[157] A mass of 200\u00a0kg (440\u00a0lb) has been cited for the common ostrich but no wild ostriches of this weight have been verified.[158] Eggs laid by the ostrich can weigh 1.4\u00a0kg (3.1\u00a0lb) and are the largest eggs in the world today.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe largest bird in the fossil record may be the extinct elephant birds (Aepyornithidae) of Madagascar, which were related to the kiwis. *Aepyornis* exceeded 3\u00a0m (9.8\u00a0ft) in height and 500\u00a0kg (1,100\u00a0lb), while *Vorombe* could reach a similar height and a mass of 732\u00a0kg (1,614\u00a0lb).[159] The last of the elephant birds became extinct about 300 years ago. Of almost exactly the same upper proportions as the largest elephant birds was *Dromornis stirtoni* of Australia, part of a 26,000-year-old group called mihirungs of the family Dromornithidae.[160] The largest carnivorous bird was *Brontornis*, an extinct flightless bird from South America which reached a weight of 350 to 400\u00a0kg (770 to 880\u00a0lb) and a height of about 2.8\u00a0m (9\u00a0ft 2\u00a0in).[161] The tallest carnivorous bird was *Kelenken*, which could reach 3 to 3.2 meters in height and 220 to 250 kilograms. The tallest bird ever was the giant moa (*Dinornis maximus*), part of the moa family of New Zealand that went extinct around 1500 AD. This particular species of moa stood up to 3.7\u00a0m (12\u00a0ft) tall,[157] but weighed about half as much as a large elephant bird or mihirung due to its comparatively slender frame.[1]\n\n\nThe heaviest bird ever capable of flight was *Argentavis magnificens*, the largest member of the now extinct family Teratornithidae, found in Miocene-aged fossil beds of Argentina, with a wingspan up to 5.5\u00a0m (18\u00a0ft), a length of up to 1.25\u00a0m (4.1\u00a0ft), a height on the ground of up to 1.75\u00a0m (5.7\u00a0ft) and a body weight of at least 71\u00a0kg (157\u00a0lb).[1][162][163] *Pelagornis sandersi* is thought to have had an even larger wingspan of about 6.1\u20137.4\u00a0m (20\u201324\u00a0ft), but is only about 22\u201340\u00a0kg (49\u201388\u00a0lb), half the mass of the former.[164][163]\n\n\n\n##### Heaviest living bird species[edit]\n\n\nThe following is a list of the heaviest living bird species based on maximum reported or reliable mass, but average weight is also given for comparison. These species are almost all flightless, which allows for these particular birds to have denser bones and heavier bodies. Flightless birds comprise less than 2% of all living bird species.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Animal\n | Binomial Name\n | Average mass[kg (lb)]\n | Maximum mass[kg (lb)]\n | Average total length[cm (ft)]\n | Flighted |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Common ostrich | *Struthio camelus* | 104 (230)[165] | 156.8 (346)[165] | 210 (6.9)[166] | No\n |\n| 2 | Somali ostrich | *Struthio molybdophanes* | 90 (200)[165] | 130 (287)[*citation needed*] | 200 (6.6)[165] | No\n |\n| 3 | Southern cassowary | *Casuarius casuarius* | 45 (99)[165] | 85 (190)[167] | 155 (5.1)[165] | No\n |\n| 4 | Northern cassowary | *Casuarius unappendiculatus* | 44 (97)[165] | 75 (170)[165] | 149 (4.9)[166] | No\n |\n| 5 | Emu | *Dromaius novaehollandiae* | 33 (73)[165][168] | 70 (150)[*citation needed*] | 153 (5)[165] | No\n |\n| 6 | Emperor penguin | *Aptenodytes forsteri* | 31.5 (69)[166][169] | 46 (100)[166] | 114 (3.7)[166] | No\n |\n| 7 | Greater rhea | *Rhea americana* | 23 (51)[168] | 40 (88)[166] | 134 (4.4)[165] | No\n |\n| 8 | Domestic turkey/wild turkey | *Meleagris gallopavo* | 13.5 (29.8) [170] | 39 (86)[171] | 100 - 124.9 (3.3 \u2013 4.1)[*citation needed*] | Yes\n |\n| 9 | Dwarf cassowary | *Casuarius bennetti* | 19.7 (43)[165] | 34 (75)[165] | 105 (3.4)[*citation needed*] | No\n |\n| 10 | Lesser rhea | *Rhea pennata* | 19.6 (43)[165] | 28.6 (63)[165] | 96 (3.2)[166] | No\n |\n| 11 | Mute swan | *Cygnus olor* | 11.87 (26.2) | 23 (51) | 100-130 (3.3 - 4.3)[172] | Yes\n |\n| 12 | Great bustard | *Otis tarda* | 10.6 (23.4)[*citation needed*] | 21 (46)[1] | 115 (3.8)[*citation needed*] | Yes\n |\n| 13 | King penguin | *Aptenodytes patagonicus* | 13.6 (30)[166][169] | 20 (44)[173] | 92 (3)[*citation needed*] | No\n |\n| 14 | Kori bustard | *Ardeotis kori* | 11.4 (25.1)[166] | 20 (44.1)[*citation needed*] | 150 (5)[166] | Yes\n |\n| 15 | Trumpeter swan | *Cygnus buccinator* | 11.6 (25.1) | 17.2 (38) | 138 - 165 (4.5 - 5.4) | Yes\n |\n| 16 | Wandering albatross | *Diomedea exulans* | 11.9 (24) | 16.1 (38)[174] | 107 - 135 (3.5 - 4.4) | Yes\n |\n| 17 | Whooper swan | *Cygnus cygnus* | 11.4 (25) | 15.5 (32) | 140 - 165 (4.5 - 5.4) | Yes\n |\n| 18 | Dalmatian Pelican | *Pelecanus crispus* | 11.5 (25) | 15 (33.1)[*citation needed*] | 183 (6)[*citation needed*] | Yes\n |\n| 19 | Andean condor | *Vultur gryphus* | 11.3 (25)[172] | 14.9 (33)[172] | 100 - 130 (3.3 - 4.3)[172] | Yes\n |\n\n\n### Amphibians (Amphibia)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A giant salamander, the largest living amphibian.\nThe largest living amphibian is the South China giant salamander (*Andrias sligoi*). Formerly considered conspecific with the Chinese giant salamander (*A. davidianus*), the maximum size of this nearly human-sized river-dweller is 64\u00a0kg (141\u00a0lb) and almost 1.83\u00a0m (6.0\u00a0ft).[1] Before amniotes became the dominant tetrapods, several giant amphibian proto-tetrapods existed and were certainly the dominant animals in their ecosystems. The largest known was the crocodile-like *Prionosuchus*, which reached a length of 9\u00a0m (30\u00a0ft).[175]\n\n\n\nFrogs (Anura)\n![](image)The massive and destructive cane toad ranks as the largest toad in the world.\nThe largest member of the largest order of amphibians is the African goliath frog (*Conraua goliath*). The maximum size this species is verified to attain is a weight of 3.8\u00a0kg (8.4\u00a0lb) and a snout-to-vent length of 39\u00a0cm (15\u00a0in).[1] The largest of the toads, the cane toad (*Rhinella marina*), is also the second largest member of the frog order. This infamous, often invasive species can grow to maximum mass of 2.65\u00a0kg (5.8\u00a0lb) and measure a maximum of 33\u00a0cm (13\u00a0in) from snout-to-vent.[1] Rivaling the previous two species, the African bullfrog (*Pyxicephalus adspersus*) can range up to a weight of 2\u00a0kg (4.4\u00a0lb) and 25.5\u00a0cm (10.0\u00a0in) from snout to vent.[176] Another large frog is the largest frog in North America, the American bullfrog, which can reach weights of up to 0.8\u00a0kg (1.8\u00a0lb) and snout-to-vent-length (SVL) of 20\u00a0cm (7.9\u00a0in). However, the toad *Beelzebufo ampinga*, found in fossil from the Cretaceous era in what is now Madagascar, was estimated to grow to 41\u00a0cm (16\u00a0in) long and weigh up to 4.5\u00a0kg (9.9\u00a0lb), making it the largest frog ever known.[177] But in more recent studies, animals of this species have been estimated to have grown to at least 23.2\u00a0cm (9.1\u00a0in) (snout-vent length), which is around the size a modern African bullfrog can reach.[178] The largest tree frog is the Australasian white-lipped tree frog (*Litoria infrafrenata*), the females of which can reach a length of 14\u00a0cm (5.5\u00a0in) from snout to vent and can weigh up to 115\u00a0g (4.1\u00a0oz).[179] The family Leptodactylidae, one of the most diverse anuran families, also has some very large members. The largest is the Surinam horned frog (*Ceratophrys cornuta*), which can reach 20\u00a0cm (7.9\u00a0in) in length from snout to vent and weigh up to 0.48\u00a0kg (1.1\u00a0lb).[180] While not quite as large as *Ceratophrys cornuta*, *Leptodactylus pentadactylus* is often heavier; it can reach 18.5\u00a0cm (7.3\u00a0in) long and weigh 0.60 kilograms (1.3 pounds). The largest dendrobatid is the Colombian golden poison frog (*Phyllobates terribilis*), which can attain a length of 6\u00a0cm (2.4\u00a0in) and nearly 28.3\u00a0g (1.00\u00a0oz).[181] Most frogs are classified under the suborder Neobatrachia, although nearly 200 species are part of the suborder Mesobatrachia, or ancient frogs. The largest of these are the little-known *Brachytarsophrys* or Karin Hills frogs, of South Asia, which can grow to a maximum snout-to-vent length of 17\u00a0cm (6.7\u00a0in) and a maximum weight of 0.54\u00a0kg (1.2\u00a0lb).[182]\nCaecilians (Gymnophiona)\nThe largest of the worm-like caecilians is the Colombian Thompson's caecilian (*Caecilia thompsoni*), which reaches a length of 1.5\u00a0m (4.9\u00a0ft), a width of about 4.6\u00a0cm (1.8\u00a0in) and can weigh up to about 1\u00a0kg (2.2\u00a0lb).[1]\nSalamanders (Urodela)\nBesides the previously mentioned Chinese and South China giant salamanders, the closely related Japanese giant salamander (*Andrias japonicus*) is also sometimes cited as the largest living amphibian, but salamanders of a greater size than 1.53\u00a0m (5.0\u00a0ft) and 36\u00a0kg (79\u00a0lb) have never been verified for this species. Another giant of the amphibian world is the North American hellbender (*Cryptobranchus alleganiensis*), which can measure up to 0.76\u00a0m (2.5\u00a0ft). The recently described reticulated siren of the southeastern United States rivals the hellbender in size, although it is more lean in build.[183] The largest of the newts is the Iberian ribbed newt (*Pleurodeles waltl*), which can grow up to 30\u00a0cm (12\u00a0in) in length.[184]\n### Fish[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of largest fish\n\n## Invertebrate chordates[edit]\n\n\n### Tunicates (Tunicata)[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Tunicata\n\nThe largest tunicates are *Synoicum pulmonaria*, found at depths of 20 and 40 metres (66 and 131\u00a0ft), and are up to 14 centimetres (6\u00a0in) in diameter. It is also present in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean, around the coasts of Greenland and Newfoundland, but is less common here than in the east, and occurs only at depths between 10 and 13 metres (33 and 43\u00a0ft).[185]\n\n\n\nEntergonas (Enterogona)\nThe largest entergonas *Synoicum pulmonaria* it is usually found at depths between about 20 and 40 metres (66 and 131\u00a0ft) and can grow to over a metre (yard) in length. It is also present in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean, around the coasts of Greenland and Newfoundland, but is less common here than in the east, and occurs only at depths between 10 and 13 metres (33 and 43\u00a0ft).[185]\nPleurogonas (Pleurogona)\nThe largest pleurogonas: *Pyura pachydermatina* .[186] In colour it is off-white or a garish shade of reddish-purple. The stalk is two thirds to three quarters the length of the whole animal which helps distinguish it from certain invasive tunicates not native to New Zealand such as *Styela clava* and *Pyura stolonifera*.[187] It is one of the largest species of tunicates and can grow to over a metre (yard) in length.[188]\nAspiraculates (Aspiraculata)\nThe largest aspiraculates: *Oligotrema* large and surrounded by six large lobes; the cloacal syphon is small. They live exclusively in deep water and range in size from less than one inch (2 cm) to 2.4 inches (6 cm).\n#### Thaliacea[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The *Pyrosoma atlanticum* is the largest thaliacean.\nThe largest thaliacean, *Pyrosoma atlanticum*, is cylindrical and can grow up to 60\u00a0cm (2\u00a0ft) long and 4\u20136\u00a0cm wide. The constituent zooids form a rigid tube, which may be pale pink, yellowish, or bluish. One end of the tube is narrower and is closed, while the other is open and has a strong diaphragm. The outer surface or test is gelatinised and dimpled with backward-pointing, blunt processes. The individual zooids are up to 8.5\u00a0mm (0.33\u00a0in) long and have a broad, rounded branchial sac with gill slits. Along the side of the branchial sac runs the endostyle, which produces mucus filters. Water is moved through the gill slits into the centre of the cylinder by cilia pulsating rhythmically. Plankton and other food particles are caught in mucus filters in the processes as the colony is propelled through the water. *P. atlanticum* is bioluminescent and can generate a brilliant blue-green light when stimulated.[189][190]\n\n\n\nDoliolida (Doliolida)\nThe largest doliolida: *Doliolida* [191] The doliolid body is small, typically 1\u20132\u00a0cm long, and barrel-shaped; it features two wide siphons, one at the front and the other at the back end, and eight or nine circular muscle strands reminiscent of barrel bands. Like all tunicates, they are filter feeders. They are free-floating; the same forced flow of water through their bodies with which they gather plankton is used for propulsion - not unlike a tiny ramjet engine. Doliolids are capable of quick movement. They have a complicated lifecycle consisting of sexual and asexual generations. They are nearly exclusively tropical animals, although a few species are found as far north as northern California.[*citation needed*]\nSalps (Salpida)\nThe largest salps: *Cyclosalpa bakeri* 15cm (6ins) long. There are openings at the anterior and posterior ends of the cylinder which can be opened or closed as needed. The bodies have seven transverse bands of muscle interspersed by white, translucent patches. A stolon grows from near the endostyle (an elongated glandular structure producing mucus for trapping food particles). The stolon is a ribbon-like organ on which a batch of aggregate forms of the animal are produced by budding. The aggregate is the second, colonial form of the salp and is also gelatinous, transparent and flabby. It takes the shape of a radial whorl of individuals up to about 20cm (4in) in diameter. It is formed of approximately 12 zooids linked side by side in a shape that resembles a crown.[189][192] are largest thetyses: *Thetys vagina* Individuals can reach up to 30\u00a0cm (12\u00a0in) long.[*citation needed*]\nLarvaceans (Larvacea)\nThe largest larvaceans: *Appendicularia* 1\u00a0cm (0.39\u00a0in) in body length (excluding the tail).[*citation needed*]\n### Cephalochordates (Leptocardii)[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Leptocardii\n\nThe largest lancelet is the European lancelet (*Branchiostoma lanceolatum*) \"primitive fish\". It can grow up to 6\u00a0cm (2.5\u00a0in) long.[193]\n\n\n\n## Invertebrate non-chordates[edit]\n\n\n### Echinoderms (Echinodermata)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)At up to 3\u00a0m (9.8\u00a0ft) long, the sea cucumber *Synapta maculata* is the longest known echinoderm.\nThe largest species of echinoderm in terms of bulk is probably the starfish species *Thromidia gigas*, of the class Asteroidea, which reaches a weight of over 6\u00a0kg (13\u00a0lb),[194] but it might be beaten by some giant sea cucumbers such as *Thelenota anax*. However, at a maximum span of 63\u00a0cm (25\u00a0in), *Thromidia gigas* is quite a bit shorter than some other echinoderms.[1] The longest echinoderm known is the conspicuous sea cucumber *Synapta maculata*, with a slender body that can extend up to 3\u00a0m (9.8\u00a0ft). In comparison, the biggest sea star is the brisingid sea star *Midgardia xandaros*, reaching a span of 1.4\u00a0m (4.6\u00a0ft), despite being quite slender.[1] *Evasterias echinosoma* is another giant echinoderm and can measure up to 1\u00a0m (3.3\u00a0ft) across and weigh 5.1\u00a0kg (11\u00a0lb).[1]\n\n\n\nCrinoids (Crinoidea)\nThe largest species of crinoid is the unstalked feather-star *Heliometra glacialis*, reaching a total width of 78\u00a0cm (31\u00a0in) and an individual arm length of 35\u00a0cm (14\u00a0in). A width of 91.4\u00a0cm (36.0\u00a0in) was claimed for one unstalked feather-star but is not confirmed.[1] The genus *Metacrinus* has a stalk span of 61\u00a0cm (24\u00a0in) but, due to its bulk and multiple arms, it is heavier than *Heliometra*.[1] In the past, crinoids grew much larger, and stalk lengths up to 40\u00a0m (130\u00a0ft) have been found in the fossil record.[195]\nSea urchins and allies (Echinoidea)\nThe largest sea urchin is the species *Sperosoma giganteum* from the deep northwest Pacific Ocean, which can reach a shell width of about 30\u00a0cm (12\u00a0in).[196] Another deep sea species *Hygrosoma hoplacantha* is only slightly smaller.[196] The largest species found along the North America coast is the Pacific red sea urchin (*Mesocentrotus franciscanus*) where the shell can reach 19\u00a0cm (7.5\u00a0in).[197] If the spines enter into count, the biggest species may be a Diadematidae like *Diadema setosum*, with a test up to 10\u00a0cm (3.9\u00a0in) only, but its spines can reach up to 30\u00a0cm (12\u00a0in) in length.[198]\nSea cucumbers (Holothuroidea)\nThe bulkiest species of sea cucumber are *Stichopus variegatus* and *Thelenota anax*, weighing several pounds, being about 21\u00a0cm (8.3\u00a0in) in diameter, and reaching a length of 1\u00a0m (3.3\u00a0ft) when fully extended. *Synapta maculata* can reach an extended length of 3\u00a0m (9.8\u00a0ft), but is extremely slender (3-5cm) and weigh much less than Stichopodids.[1]\nBrittle stars (Ophiuroidea)\nThe largest known specimen of brittle star is the basket star *Astrotoma agassizii*. This species can grow to have a span of 1\u00a0m (3.3\u00a0ft).[1] Sometimes, *Gorgonocephalus stimpsoni* is considered the largest but the maximum this species is can measure 70\u00a0cm (28\u00a0in) and a disk diameter of about 14.3\u00a0cm (5.6\u00a0in). Outside from euryalids, the biggest ophiurid brittle star may be *Ophiopsammus maculata* (6\u20137 inches).[199]\nSea stars (Asteroidea)\nThe heaviest sea star is *Thromidia gigas* from the Indo-Pacific, which can surpass 6\u00a0kg (13\u00a0lb) in weight, but only has a diameter of about 65\u00a0cm (2.13\u00a0ft).[194][196] Despite its relatively small disk and weight, the long slender arms of *Midgardia xandaros* from the Gulf of California makes it the sea star with the largest diameter at about 1.4\u00a0m (4.5\u00a0ft).[196] *Mithrodia clavigera* may also become wider than 1\u00a0m (39\u00a0in) in some cases, with stout arms.[*citation needed*]\n### Flatworms (Platyhelminthes)[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Platyhelminthes\n\nMonogenean flatworms (Monogenea)\nThe largest known members of this group of very small parasites are among the genus of capsalids, *Listrocephalos*, reaching a length of 2\u00a0cm (0.79\u00a0in).[200]\nFlukes (Trematoda)\nThe largest known species of fluke is *Fasciolopsis buski*, which most often attacks humans and livestock. One of these flukes can be up to 7.5\u00a0cm (3.0\u00a0in) long and 2\u00a0cm (0.79\u00a0in) thick.[201]\nTapeworms (Cestoda)\nThe largest known species of tapeworm is the whale tapeworm, *Polygonoporus giganticus*, which can grow to over 30\u00a0m (98\u00a0ft).[202][203]\n### Segmented worms (Annelida)[edit]\n\n\nThe largest of the segmented worms (including earthworms, leeches, and polychaetes) is the African giant earthworm (*Microchaetus rappi*). Although it averages about 1.36\u00a0m (4.5\u00a0ft) in length, this huge worm can reach a length of as much as 6.7\u00a0m (22\u00a0ft) and can weigh over 1.5\u00a0kg (3.3\u00a0lb).[204] Only the giant Gippsland earthworm, *Megascolides australis*, and a few giant polychaetes, including the notorious *Eunice aphroditois*, reach nearly comparable sizes, reaching 4 and 3.6\u00a0m (13 and 12\u00a0ft), respectively.[1]\n\n\n\n### Ribbon worms (Nemertea)[edit]\n\n\nThe largest nemertean is the bootlace worm, *Lineus longissimus*. A specimen found washed ashore on a beach in St. Andrews, Scotland in 1864 was recorded at a length of 55\u00a0m (180\u00a0ft).[205]\n\n\n\n### Mollusks (Mollusca)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A 7\u00a0m (23\u00a0ft) giant squid, the second largest of all invertebrates, encased in ice in the Melbourne Aquarium.\nBoth the largest mollusks and the largest of all invertebrates (in terms of mass) are the largest squids. The colossal squid (*Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni*) is projected to be the largest invertebrate.[206] Current estimates put its maximum size at 12 to 14\u00a0m (39 to 46\u00a0ft) long and 750\u00a0kg (1,650\u00a0lb),[207] based on analysis of smaller specimens. In 2007, authorities in New Zealand announced the capture of the largest known colossal squid specimen. It was initially thought to be 10\u00a0m (33\u00a0ft) and 450\u00a0kg (990\u00a0lb). It was later measured at 4.2\u00a0m (14\u00a0ft) long and 495\u00a0kg (1,091\u00a0lb) in weight. The mantle was 2.5\u00a0m (8.2\u00a0ft) long when measured.[208][209]\n\n\nThe giant squid (*Architeuthis dux*) was previously thought to be the largest squid, and while it is less massive and has a smaller mantle than the colossal squid, it may exceed the colossal squid in overall length including tentacles. One giant squid specimen that washed ashore in 1878 in Newfoundland reportedly measured 16.8\u00a0m (55\u00a0ft) in total length (from the tip of the mantle to the end of the long tentacles), head and body length 6.1\u00a0m (20\u00a0ft), 4.6\u00a0m (15\u00a0ft) in circumference at the thickest part of mantle, and weighed about 900\u00a0kg (2,000\u00a0lb). This specimen is still often cited as the largest invertebrate that has ever been examined.[1][210][211] However, no animals approaching this size have been scientifically documented and, according to giant squid expert Steve O'Shea, such lengths were likely achieved by greatly stretching the two tentacles like elastic bands.[212]\n\n\n\nAplacophorans (Aplacophora)\nThe largest known of these worm-like, shell-less mollusks are represented in the genus *Epimenia*, which can reach 30\u00a0cm (12\u00a0in) long. Most aplacophorans are less than 5\u00a0cm (2.0\u00a0in) long.[213]\nChitons (Polyplacophora)\nThe largest of the chitons is the gumboot chiton, *Cryptochiton stelleri*, which can reach a length of 33\u00a0cm (13\u00a0in) and weigh over 2\u00a0kg (4.4\u00a0lb).[214]\n![](image)The mouth of a mostly hidden giant clam, the largest bivalve\nBivalves (Bivalvia)\nThe largest of the bivalve mollusks is the giant clam, *Tridacna gigas*. Although even larger sizes have been reported for this passive animal, the top verified size was for a specimen from the Great Barrier Reef. This creature weighed 270\u00a0kg (600\u00a0lb), had an axial length of 1.14\u00a0m (3.7\u00a0ft) and depth of 0.75\u00a0m (2.5\u00a0ft).[1] The largest bivalve ever was *Platyceramus platinus*, a Cretaceous giant that reached an axial length of up to 3\u00a0m (nearly 10\u00a0ft).[215]\nGastropods (Gastropoda)\nThe \"largest\" of this most diverse and successful mollusk class of slugs and snails can be defined in various ways.\nThe living gastropod species that has the largest (longest) shell is *Syrinx aruanus* with a maximum shell length of 0.91\u00a0m (3.0\u00a0ft), a weight of 18\u00a0kg (40\u00a0lb) and a width of 96\u00a0cm (38\u00a0in).[216][217] Another giant species is *Melo amphora*, which in a 1974 specimen from Western Australia, measured 0.71\u00a0m (2.3\u00a0ft) long, had a maximum girth of 0.97\u00a0m (3.2\u00a0ft) and weighed 16\u00a0kg (35\u00a0lb).[1]\nThe largest shell-less gastropod is the giant black sea hare (*Aplysia vaccaria*) at 0.99\u00a0m (3.2\u00a0ft) in length and almost 14\u00a0kg (31\u00a0lb) in weight.\nThe largest of the land snails is the giant African snail (*Achatina achatina*) at up to 1\u00a0kg (2.2\u00a0lb) and 35\u00a0cm (14\u00a0in) long.\nCephalopods (Cephalopoda)\n(See Cephalopod size.) While generally much smaller than the giant *Architeuthis* and *Mesonychoteuthis*, the largest of the octopuses, the giant Pacific octopus (*Enteroctopus dofleini*), can grow to be very large. The largest confirmed weight of a giant octopus is 74\u00a0kg (163\u00a0lb),[218] with a 7\u00a0m (23\u00a0ft) arm span (with the tentacles fully extended) and a head-to-tentacle-tip length of 3.9\u00a0m (13\u00a0ft).[219] Specimens have been reported up to 125\u00a0kg (276\u00a0lb) but are unverified. A weight of 10 - 50kg is a much more common size.[1]\n### Roundworms (Nematoda)[edit]\n\n\nThe largest roundworm, *Placentonema gigantissima*,[220] is a parasite found in the placentas of sperm whales which can reach up to 9\u00a0m (30\u00a0ft) in length.[221]\n\n\n\n### Velvet worms (Onychophora)[edit]\n\n\nThe largest velvet worm known is Sol\u00f3rzano's velvet worm (*Peripatus solorzanoi*). An adult female was recorded to have a body length of 22\u00a0cm (approximately 8.7 in).[222]\n\n\n\n### Arthropods (Arthropoda)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Japanese spider crab.\nThe largest arthropod known to have existed is the eurypterid (sea scorpion) *Jaekelopterus*, reaching up to 2.5\u00a0m (8.2\u00a0ft) in body length, followed by the millipede relative *Arthropleura* at around 2.1\u00a0m (6.9\u00a0ft) in length.[223] Among living arthropods, the Japanese spider crab (*Macrocheira kaempferi*) is the largest in overall size, the record specimen, caught in 1921, had an extended arm span of 3.8\u00a0m (12\u00a0ft) and weighed about 19\u00a0kg (42\u00a0lb).[1] The heaviest is the American lobster (*Homarus americanus*), the largest verified specimen, caught in 1977 off of Nova Scotia weighed 20\u00a0kg (44\u00a0lb) and its body length was 1.1\u00a0m (3.6\u00a0ft).[1] The largest land arthropod and the largest land invertebrate is the coconut crab (*Birgus latro*), up to 40\u00a0cm (1.3\u00a0ft) long and weighing up to 4\u00a0kg (8.8\u00a0lb) on average. Its legs may span 1\u00a0m (3.3\u00a0ft).[1]\n\n\n\n#### Arachnids (Arachnida)[edit]\n\n\nBoth spiders and scorpions include contenders for the largest arachnids.\n\n\n\n![](image)Giant huntsman spider\nSpiders (Araneae)\nThe largest species of arachnid by length is probably the giant huntsman spider (*Heteropoda maxima*) of Laos, which in 2008 replaced the Goliath birdeater (*Theraphosa blondi*) of northern South America as the largest known spider by leg-span.[224] However the most massive arachnids, of comparable dimensions and possibly even greater mass, are the Chaco golden knee (*Grammostola pulchripes*), and the Brazilian salmon pink (*Lasiodora parahybana*). The huntsman spider may span up to 29\u00a0cm (11\u00a0in) across the legs, while in the New World tarantulas like *Theraphosa* can range up to 26\u00a0cm (10\u00a0in).[1] In *Grammostola*, *Theraphosa* and *Lasiodora*, the weight is projected to be up to at least 150\u00a0g (5.3\u00a0oz) and body length is up to 10\u00a0cm (3.9\u00a0in).[225]\nScorpions (Scorpiones)\nThe largest of the scorpions is the species *Heterometrus swammerdami* of the Indian subcontinent, which have a maximum length of 29.2\u00a0cm (11.5\u00a0in) and weigh around 60\u00a0g (2.1\u00a0oz). Another extremely large scorpion is the African emperor scorpion (*Pandinus imperator*), which can weigh 57\u00a0g (2.0\u00a0oz) but is not known to exceed a length of 23\u00a0cm (9.1\u00a0in).[1] However, they were dwarfed by *Pulmonoscorpius kirktonensis*, a giant extinct species of scorpion from Scotland, at an estimated length of 0.7\u00a0m (2.3\u00a0ft),[226] and the aquatic *Brontoscorpio*, at up to 94\u00a0cm (3.08\u00a0ft) which is only known from a free finger.[227]\nPseudoscorpions (Pseudoscorpiones)\nThe largest pseudoscorpion is *Garypus titanius*, from Ascension island, which can be 12\u00a0mm (0.47\u00a0in) long.[228]\n#### Crustaceans (Crustacea)[edit]\n\n\nThe largest crustacean is the Tasmanian giant crab (*Pseudocarcinus gigas*), with a weight of 13 kilograms (29\u00a0lb) and a carapace width of up to 46 centimetres (18\u00a0in). It is the only species in the genus ***Pseudocarcinus***.[229] Males reach more than twice the size of females.[230] At a length of up to 40 centimetres (16\u00a0in), *Lysiosquillina maculata* is the largest mantis shrimp in the world.[231] Tasmanian giant freshwater crayfish (*Astacopsis gouldi*) 5 kilograms (11\u00a0lb) in weight and over 80 centimetres (31\u00a0in) long have been known in the past, but now, even individuals over 2 kilograms (4.4\u00a0lb) are rare.[232] The species is only found in Tasmanian rivers flowing north into the Bass Strait below 400 metres (1,300\u00a0ft) above sea level, and is listed as an endangered species on the IUCN Red List.[233]\n\n\n\nBranchiopods (Branchiopoda)\nThe largest of these primarily freshwater crustaceans is probably *Branchinecta gigas*, which can reach a length 10\u00a0cm (3.9\u00a0in).[234]\nBarnacles and allies (Maxillopoda)\nThe largest species is *Pennella balaenopterae*, a copepod and ectoparasite specialising in parasitising marine mammals. The maximum size attained is 32\u00a0cm (about 13\u00a0in).[235] The largest of the barnacles is the giant acorn barnacle, *Balanus nubilis*, reaching 7\u00a0cm (2.8\u00a0in) in diameter and 12.7\u00a0cm (5.0\u00a0in) high.[236]\nOstracods (Ostracoda)\nThe largest living representative of these small and little-known but numerous crustaceans is the species *Gigantocypris australis* females of which reaching a maximum length of 3\u00a0cm (1.2\u00a0in).\nAmphipods, isopods, and allies (Peracarida)![](image)Giant isopod\nThe largest species is the giant isopod (*Bathynomus pergiganteus*), which can reach a length of 45\u00a0cm (18\u00a0inches) and a weight of 1.7\u00a0kg (3.7\u00a0lb).[237]\nRemipedes (Remipedia)\nThe largest of these cave-dwelling crustaceans is the species *Godzillius robustus*, at up to 4.5\u00a0cm (1.8\u00a0in).[238]\n#### Horseshoe crabs (Xiphosura)[edit]\n\n\nThe four modern horseshoe crabs are of roughly the same sizes, with females measuring up to 60\u00a0cm (2.0\u00a0ft) in length and 5\u00a0kg (11\u00a0lb) in weight.[239]\n\n\n\n#### Sea spiders (Pycnogonida)[edit]\n\n\nThe largest of the sea spiders is the deep-sea species *Colossendeis colossea*, attaining a leg span of nearly 60\u00a0cm (2.0\u00a0ft).[240]\n\n\n\n#### Trilobites (Trilobita)[edit]\n\n\nSome of these extinct marine arthropods exceeded 60\u00a0cm (24\u00a0in) in length. A nearly complete specimen of *Isotelus rex* from Manitoba attained a length over 70\u00a0cm (28\u00a0in), and an *Ogyginus forteyi* from Portugal was almost as long. Fragments of trilobites suggest even larger record sizes. An isolated pygidium of *Hungioides bohemicus* implies that the full animal was 90\u00a0cm (35\u00a0in) long.[241][242]\n\n\n\n#### Myriapods (Myriapoda)[edit]\n\n\nCentipedes (Chilopoda)\n![](image)*Scolopendra gigantea*\nThe biggest of the centipedes is *Scolopendra gigantea* of the neotropics, reaching a length of 33\u00a0cm (13\u00a0in).[243]\nMillipedes (Diplopoda)\nTwo species of millipede both reach a very large size: *Archispirostreptus gigas* of East Africa and *Scaphistostreptus seychellarum*, endemic to the Seychelles islands. Both of these species can slightly exceed a length of 28\u00a0cm (11\u00a0in) and measure over 2\u00a0cm (0.79\u00a0in) in diameter.[1] The largest ever known was the *Arthropleura*, a gigantic prehistoric specimen that reached nearly 189\u00a0cm (74\u00a0in).\nSymphylans (Symphyla)\nThe largest known symphylan is *Hanseniella magna*, originating in Tasmanian caves, which can reach lengths from 25\u00a0mm (0.98\u00a0in) up to 30\u00a0mm (1.2\u00a0in).[244]\n#### Insects (Insecta)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Goliath beetle\nInsects, a class of Arthropoda, are easily the most numerous class of organisms, with over one million identified species, and probably many undescribed species. The heaviest insect is almost certainly a species of beetle, which incidentally is the most species-rich order of organisms. Although heavyweight giant wetas (*Deinacrida heteracantha*) are known, the elephant beetles of Central and South America, (*Megasoma elephas*) and (*M. actaeon*), the Titan beetle (*Titanus giganteus*) of the neotropical rainforest or the Goliath beetles, (*Goliathus goliatus*) and (*G. regius*), of Africa's rainforest are thought to reach a higher weight.[245] The most frequently crowned are the Goliath beetles, the top known size of which is at least 100\u00a0g (3.5\u00a0oz) and 11.5\u00a0cm (4.5\u00a0in).[1] The elephant beetles and titan beetle can reach greater lengths than the Goliath, at up to 13.1 and 15.2\u00a0cm (5.2 and 6.0\u00a0in), respectively, but this is in part thanks to their rather large horns. The Goliath beetle's wingspan can range up to 25\u00a0cm (9.8\u00a0in).[1]\n\n\nSome moths and butterflies have much larger areas than the heaviest beetles, but weigh a fraction as much.\n\n\nThe longest insects are the stick insects, see below.\n\n\nRepresentatives of the extinct dragonfly-like order Meganisoptera, such as the Carboniferous *Meganeura monyi* of what is now France and the Permian *Meganeuropsis permiana* of what is now North America, are the largest insect species known to have existed. These creatures had a wingspan of some 75\u00a0cm (30\u00a0in) and a mass of over 1 pound (450\u00a0g), making them about the size of a crow.[1]\n\n\n\nCockroaches and termites (Blattodea)\n![](image)Giant burrowing cockroach\nThe largest cockroach by body mass is the Australian giant burrowing cockroach (*Macropanesthia rhinoceros*), also known as the rhinoceros cockroach. This species can attain a length of 8.3\u00a0cm (3.3\u00a0in) and a weight of 36\u00a0g (1.3\u00a0oz). It does not have wings.[246] The Brazilian giant cockroach (*Blaberus giganteus*) of the neotropics reaches greater sizes of up to 10 cm in length and 15 cm in wingspan, although it is not as massive and heavy as the burrowing species. The termites, traditionally classified in their own order (Isoptera), have recently been re-considered to belong in Blattodea. The largest of the termites is the African species *Macrotermes bellicosus*. The queen of this species can attain a length of 14\u00a0cm (5.5\u00a0in) and breadth of 5.5\u00a0cm (2.2\u00a0in) across the abdomen; other adults, on the other hand, are about a third of the size.[1]\nBeetles (Coleoptera)\nThe beetles are the largest order of organisms on earth, with about 400,000 species so far identified. The most massive species are the *Goliathus*, *Megasoma* and *Titanus* beetles already mentioned. Another fairly large species is the Hercules beetle (*Dynastes hercules*) of the neotropic rainforest with a maximum overall length of at least 19\u00a0cm (7.5\u00a0in) including the extremely long pronotal horn. The weight in this species does not exceed 16.5\u00a0g (0.58\u00a0oz).[1] The longest overall beetle is a species of longhorn beetle, *Batocera wallacei*, from New Guinea, which can attain a length of 26.6\u00a0cm (10.5\u00a0in), about 19\u00a0cm (7.5\u00a0in) of which is comprised by the long antennae.[1]\nEarwigs (Dermaptera)\nSince 1798, the largest of the earwigs has been the Saint Helena giant earwig (*Labidura herculeana*), endemic to the island of its name, measuring up to 8\u00a0cm (3.1\u00a0in) in length.[247] As of 2014, with the declaring of the organism extinct by the IUCN,[248] this may no longer be the case, although some believe a small number individuals are still extant.[249]\nTrue flies (Diptera)\n![](image)*Gauromydas heros*, the largest fly\nThe largest species of this order, which includes the common housefly, is the neotropical species *Gauromydas heros*, which can reach a length of 6\u00a0cm (2+3\u20448\u00a0in) and a wingspan of 10\u00a0cm (3.9\u00a0in).[1] Species of crane fly, the largest of which is *Holorusia brobdignagius*, can attain a length of 23\u00a0cm (9.1\u00a0in) but are extremely slender and much lighter in weight than *Gauromydas*.\nMayflies (Ephemeroptera)\nThe largest mayflies are members of the genus *Proboscidoplocia* from Madagascar. These insects can reach a length of 7\u00a0cm (2.8\u00a0in).[250]\nTrue bugs (Hemiptera)\n![](image)Giant water bug walking over land\nThe largest species of this diverse order is usually listed as the giant water bug in the genus *Lethocerus*, with *L. maximus* from the Neotropics being the absolutely largest.[251] They can surpass 12\u00a0cm (4.7\u00a0in) in length,[252] with some suggesting that the maximum size is 15\u00a0cm (5.9\u00a0in).[253] It is more slender and less heavy than most other insects of this size (principally the huge beetles). The largest cicada is *Megapomponia imperatoria*, which has a head-body length of about 7\u00a0cm (2.8\u00a0in) and a wingspan of 18\u201320\u00a0cm (7\u20138\u00a0in).[254][255] The cicadas of the genus *Tacua* can also grow to comparably large sizes. The largest type of aphid is the giant oak aphid (*Stomaphis quercus*), which can reach an overall length of 2\u00a0cm (0.79\u00a0in).[256] The biggest species of leafhopper is *Ledromorpha planirostris*, which can reach a length of 2.8\u00a0cm (1.1\u00a0in).[257]![](image)*Megachile pluto*, the largest bee.\nAnts and allies (Hymenoptera)\nThe largest of the ants, and the heaviest species of the order, are the females of the African *Dorylus helvolus*, reaching a length of 5.1\u00a0cm (2.0\u00a0in) and a weight of 8.5\u00a0g (0.30\u00a0oz).[1] The ant that averages the largest for the mean size within the whole colony is a ponerine ant, *Dinoponera gigantea*, from South America, averaging up to 3.3\u00a0cm (1.3\u00a0in) from the mandibles to the end of abdomen.[1] Workers of the bulldog ant (*Myrmecia brevinoda*) of Australia are up to 3.7\u00a0cm (1.5\u00a0in) in total length, although much of this is from their extremely large mandibles.[1] The largest of the bee species, also in the order Hymenoptera, is *Megachile pluto* of Indonesia, the females of which can be 3.8\u00a0cm (1.5\u00a0in) long, with a 6.3\u00a0cm (2.5\u00a0in) wingspan. Nearly as large, the carpenter bees can range up to 2.53\u00a0cm (1.00\u00a0in).[1] The largest wasp is probably the so-called tarantula hawk species *Pepsis pulszkyi* of South America, at up to 6.8\u00a0cm (2.7\u00a0in) long and 11.6\u00a0cm (4.6\u00a0in) wingspan, although many other *Pepsis* approach a similar size. The giant scarab-hunting wasp *Megascolia procer* may rival the largest tarantula hawks in weight and wingspan, though its body is not as long.[1]\nMoths and allies (Lepidoptera)![](image)Queen Alexandra's birdwing.\nThe Hercules moth (*Coscinocera hercules*), in the family Saturniidae, is endemic to New Guinea and northern Australia, and its wings have the largest documented surface area (300 square centimeters) of any living insect,[258][259] and a maximum wingspan which is confirmed to 28\u00a0cm (11\u00a0in) while unconfirmed specimens have spanned up to 35.5\u00a0cm (14.0\u00a0in). The largest species overall is often claimed to be either the Queen Alexandra's birdwing (*Ornithoptera alexandrae*), a butterfly from Papua New Guinea, or the Atlas moth (*Attacus atlas*), a moth from Southeast Asia. Both of these species can reach a length of 8\u00a0cm (3.1\u00a0in), a wingspan of 28\u00a0cm (11\u00a0in) and a weight of 12\u00a0g (0.42\u00a0oz). One Atlas moth allegedly had a wingspan of 30\u00a0cm (12\u00a0in) but this measurement was not verified.[1] The larvae in the previous species can weigh up to 58 and 54\u00a0g (2.0 and 1.9\u00a0oz), respectively. However, there are no reported measurements of surface area that would exceed the Hercules moth, and the white witch (*Thysania agrippina*) of Central and South America, has the largest recorded wingspan of the order, and indeed of any living insect, though the white witch is exceeded in surface area by the Hercules moth. The verified record-sized *Thysania* spanned 30.8\u00a0cm (12.1\u00a0in) across the wings, although specimens have been reported to 36\u00a0cm (14\u00a0in).[1] The heaviest mature moths have been cited in the giant carpenter moth (*Xyleutes boisduvali*) of Australia, which has weighed up to 20\u00a0g (0.71\u00a0oz) although the species does not surpass 25.5\u00a0cm (10.0\u00a0in) in wingspan.[1]\nMantises (Mantodea)\nThe largest species of this order is *Toxodera denticulata* from Java, which has been measured up to 20\u00a0cm (7.9\u00a0in) in overall length.[260] However, an undescribed species from the Cameroon jungle is allegedly much larger than any other mantis and may rival the larger stick insects for the longest living insect.[261] Among widespread mantis species, the largest is the Chinese mantis (*Tenodera aridifolia*). The females of this species can attain a length of up to 10.6\u00a0cm (4.2\u00a0in).\nScorpionflies (Mecoptera)\nThe largest scorpionfly, the common scorpionfly (*Panorpa communis*), can reach a body length of about 30 millimetres (1.2\u00a0in).[262]\nAlderflies and allies (Megaloptera)\nThis relatively small insect order includes some rather large species, many of which are noticeable for their elongated, imposing mandibles. The dobsonflies reach the greatest sizes of the order and can range up to 12.5\u00a0cm (4.9\u00a0in) in length.[263]\nNet-winged insects (Neuroptera)\n![](image)Blue eyes lacewing\nThese flying insects reach their largest size in *Palparellus voeltzkowi*, which can have a wingspan over 16\u00a0cm (6.3\u00a0in).[264] The largest lacewing is the \"blue eyes lacewing\" (*Nymphes myrmeleonides*) of Australia, which can measure up to 4\u00a0cm (1.6\u00a0in) in length and span 11\u00a0cm (4.3\u00a0in) across the wings.[265] Some forms of this ancient order could grow extremely large during the Jurassic period and may have ranked among the largest insects ever.[266] Found in the Early Cretaceous sedimentary rocks, *Makarkinia adamsi* had wings nearly 140\u2013160\u00a0mm (5.5\u20136.3\u00a0in) in length.[267]\nDragonflies (Odonata)\nThe largest species of dragonfly is *Megaloprepus caerulatus* of the neotropics, attaining a size of as much as 19\u00a0cm (7.5\u00a0in) across the wings and a body length of over 12\u00a0cm (4.7\u00a0in).[1] Spanning up to 17.6\u00a0cm (6.9\u00a0in) and measuring up to 11.8\u00a0cm (4.6\u00a0in) long, *Tetracanthagyna plagiata* of Southeast Asia is bulkier and heavier than *Megaloprepus* at up to 7\u00a0g (0.25\u00a0oz).[1]\nGrasshoppers and allies (Orthoptera)\n![](image)Giant weta\nThe largest of this widespread, varied complex of insects are the giant wetas of New Zealand, which is now split among 12 species. The largest of these is the Little Barrier Island giant weta (*Deinacrida heteracantha*), the largest specimen was weighed at 71.3\u00a0g (2.52\u00a0oz), one of the largest insects weights ever known. These heavyweight insects can be over 9\u00a0cm (3.5\u00a0in) long.[1] The largest grasshopper species is often considered to be the Australian giant grasshopper (*Valanga irregularis*), which ranges up to 9\u00a0cm (3.5\u00a0in) in length.[268] The American eastern lubber grasshopper (*Romalea guttata*) can allegedly range up to 10\u00a0cm (3.9\u00a0in) in length.[269] However, the greatest grasshopper sizes known, to 12\u00a0cm (4.7\u00a0in), have been cited in the South American giant grasshopper (*Tropidacris violaceus*). The longest members of this order (although much lighter than the giant wetas) is the katydid *Macrolyristes corporalis* of Southeast Asia which can range up to 21.5\u00a0cm (8.5\u00a0in) with its long legs extended and can have a wingspan of 20\u00a0cm (7.9\u00a0in).[270]\nStick insects (Phasmatodea)\nThe longest known stick insects are also the longest known insects, notably species in the tribe Pharnaciini, but they are generally relatively lightweight because of their slender shape. The longest is an unnamed species of *Phryganistria* discovered in China in 2016, where a specimen held at the Insect Museum of West China in Chengdu has a total length of 62.4\u00a0cm (24.6\u00a0in).[271] The second-longest species is the Australian *Ctenomorpha gargantua*, females of which have been measured at over 60\u00a0cm (24\u00a0in) in total length.[272] Other very large species, formerly believed to be longest but now considered third longest is *Sadyattes chani*; a specimen held in the Natural History Museum in London has a total length of 56.7\u00a0cm (22.3\u00a0in).[273][274] These measurements are, however, with the front legs fully extended; it has a body length measuring 35.7\u00a0cm (14.1\u00a0in).[275] Another very large species is *Phobaeticus kirbyi* where the total length (including extended legs) is up to 54.6\u00a0cm (21.5\u00a0in) and the body alone up to 32.8\u00a0cm (12.9\u00a0in).[276] Another of the longest insect in terms of total length is *Phobaeticus serratipes* of Malaysia and Singapore, measuring up to 55.5\u00a0cm (21.9\u00a0in).[277] Another extremely long stick insect is *Pharnacia maxima*, which measured 51\u00a0cm (20\u00a0in) with its legs extended.[1] The spiny stick insect (*Heteropteryx dilatata*) of Malaysia does not reach the extreme lengths of its cousins, the body reaching up to 16\u00a0cm (6.3\u00a0in) long, but it is much bulkier. The largest *Heteropteryx* weighed about 65\u00a0g (2.3\u00a0oz) and was 3.5\u00a0cm (1.4\u00a0in) wide across the thickest part of the body.[1]\nLice (Phthiraptera)\nThese insects, which live parasitically on other animals, are as a rule quite small. The largest known species is the hog louse, *Haematopinus suis*, a sucking louse that lives on large livestock like pigs and cattle. It can range up to 6\u00a0mm (0.24\u00a0in) in length.[278]\nStoneflies (Plecoptera)![](image)*Pteronarcys californica*\nThe largest species of stonefly is *Pteronarcys californica* of western North America, a species favored by fishermen as lures. This species can attain a length of 5\u00a0cm (2.0\u00a0in) and a wingspan of over 9.5\u00a0cm (3.7\u00a0in).[279]\nBooklice (Psocoptera)\nThe largest of this order of very small insects are the barklice of the genus *Psocus*, the top size of which is about 1 cm.[280]\nFleas (Siphonaptera)\nThe largest species of flea is *Hystrichopsylla schefferi*. This parasite is known exclusively from the fur of the mountain beaver (*Aplodontia rufa*) and can reach a length of 1.2\u00a0cm (0.47\u00a0in).[1]\nSilverfishes and allies (Thysanura)\nThese strange-looking insects, known to feed on human household objects, can range up to 4.3\u00a0cm (1.7\u00a0in) in length. A 350 million year old form was known to grow quite large, at up to 6\u00a0cm (2.4\u00a0in).[*citation needed*]\nThrips (Thysanoptera)\nMembers of the genus *Phasmothrips* are the largest kinds of thrips. The maximum size these species attain is approximately 1.3\u00a0cm (0.51\u00a0in) in length.[281]\nCaddisflies (Trichoptera)\nThe largest of the small, moth-like caddisflies is *Eubasilissa maclachlani*. This species can range up to 7\u00a0cm (2.8\u00a0in) across the wings.[282]\nAngel insects (Zoraptera)\nThe largest angel insect species, Hubbard's angel insect (*Zorotypus hubbardi*), grows up to 3\u00a0mm (0.12\u00a0in) in length.[283][284]\n### Cnidarians (Cnidaria)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The lion's mane jellyfish, one of the longest extant animals\nThe lion's mane jellyfish (*Cyanea capillata*) is the largest cnidarian species, of the class Scyphozoa. The largest known specimen of this giant, found washed up on the shore of Massachusetts Bay in 1870,[285][286] had a bell diameter of 2.5\u00a0m (8.2\u00a0ft), a weight of 150\u00a0kg (330\u00a0lb). The tentacles of this specimens were as long as 37\u00a0m (121\u00a0ft) and were projected to have a tentacular spread of about 75\u00a0m (246\u00a0ft) making it one of the longest extant animals.[1]\n\n\n\nCorals and sea anemones (Anthozoa)\nThe largest individual species are the sea-anemones of the genus *Discoma*, which can attain a mouth disc diameter of 60\u00a0cm (2.0\u00a0ft).[287] Longer, but much less massive overall, are the anemones of the genus *Ceriantharia*, at up to 2\u00a0m (6.6\u00a0ft) tall.[288] Communities of coral can be truly massive, a single colony of the genus *Porites* can be over 10\u00a0m (33\u00a0ft), but the actual individual organisms are quite small.\nHydrozoans (Hydrozoa)\nThe colonial siphonophore *Praya dubia* can attain lengths of 40\u201350\u00a0m (130\u2013160\u00a0ft).[289] The Portuguese man o' war's (*Physalia physalis*) tentacles can attain a length of up to 50\u00a0m (160\u00a0ft).[290] On 6 April 2020 the Schmidt Ocean Institute announced the discovery of a giant *Apolemia* siphonophore in submarine canyons near Ningaloo Coast, measuring 15\u00a0m (49\u00a0ft) diameter with a ring approximately 47\u00a0m (154\u00a0ft) long, claiming it was possibly the largest siphonophore ever recorded.[291][292]\n### Sponges (Porifera)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Despite its inert appearance, the heavyweight *Xestospongia muta* is indeed an animal\nThe largest known species of sea sponge is the giant barrel sponge, *Xestospongia muta*. These massively built sponges can reach 2.4\u00a0m (8\u00a0ft) in height and can be about the same thickness at the thickest part of the \"body\".[293] Some of these creatures have been estimated to be over 2,400 years of age.[294]\n\n\n\nCalcareous sponges (Calcarea)\nThe largest known of these small, inconspicuous sponges is probably the species *Pericharax heteroraphis*, attaining a height of 30\u00a0cm (0.98\u00a0ft). Most calcareous sponges do not exceed 10\u00a0cm (3.9\u00a0in) tall.[*citation needed*]\nHexactinellid sponges (Hexactinellida)\nA relatively common species, *Rhabdocalyptus dawsoni*, can reach a height of 1\u00a0m (3.3\u00a0ft) once they are of a very old age.[295] This is the maximum size recorded for a hexactinellid sponge.[*citation needed*]\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Largest prehistoric animals\n* Megafauna\n* Largest organisms\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** ***n*** ***o*** ***p*** ***q*** ***r*** ***s*** ***t*** ***u*** ***v*** ***w*** ***x*** ***y*** ***z*** ***aa*** ***ab*** ***ac*** ***ad*** ***ae*** ***af*** ***ag*** ***ah*** ***ai*** ***aj*** ***ak*** ***al*** ***am*** ***an*** ***ao*** ***ap*** ***aq*** ***ar*** ***as*** ***at*** ***au*** ***av*** ***aw*** ***ax*** ***ay*** ***az*** ***ba*** ***bb*** ***bc*** ***bd*** ***be*** ***bf*** ***bg*** ***bh*** ***bi*** ***bj*** ***bk*** Wood, Gerald *The Guinness Book of Animal Facts and Feats* (1983) ISBN\u00a0978-0-85112-235-9\n2. **^** Davies, Ella (20 April 2016). \"The longest animal alive may be one you never thought of\". *BBC Earth*.

It measures 10\u201313\u00a0ft at the shoulder and consumes around 230\u00a0kg (500\u00a0lb) of vegetation a day. Its tusks have been known to reach 2.7\u00a0m (9\u00a0ft) in length, although in modern populations they are most commonly recorded at a length of 0.6\u20130.9\u00a0m (2\u00a0ft 0\u00a0in\u00a0\u2013 2\u00a0ft 11\u00a0in).[1] The average walking speed of an elephant is 7.2\u00a0km/h (4.5\u00a0mph), but they can run at recorded speeds of up to 24\u00a0km/h (15\u00a0mph).[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Heaviest
