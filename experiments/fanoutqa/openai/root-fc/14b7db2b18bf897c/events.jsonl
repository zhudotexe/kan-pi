The China–Nepal border runs across its summit point.[2] Its elevation (snow height) of 8,848.86 m (29,031 ft 8+1⁄2 in) was most recently established in 2020 by the Chinese and Nepali authorities.[3][4]\n\n\nMount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal (known as the \"standard route\") and the other from the north in Tibet. While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route, Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness, weather, and wind, as well as hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall. As of November 2022, 310 people have died on Everest. Over 200 bodies remain on the mountain and have not been removed due to the dangerous conditions.[5][6]\n\n\nThe first recorded efforts to reach Everest's summit were made by British mountaineers. As Nepal did not allow foreigners to enter the country at the time, the British made several attempts on the north ridge route from the Tibetan side. After the first reconnaissance expedition by the British in 1921 reached 7,000 m (22,970 ft) on the North Col, the 1922 expedition pushed the north ridge route up to 8,320 m (27,300 ft), marking the first time a human had climbed above 8,000 m (26,247 ft). The 1924 expedition resulted in one of the greatest mysteries on Everest to this day: George Mallory and Andrew Irvine made a final summit attempt on 8 June but never returned, sparking debate as to whether they were the first to reach the top. Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary made the first documented ascent of Everest in 1953, using the southeast ridge route. Norgay had reached 8,595 m (28,199 ft) the previous year as a member of the 1952 Swiss expedition. The Chinese mountaineering team of Wang Fuzhou, Gonpo, and Qu Yinhua made the first reported ascent of the peak from the north ridge on 25 May 1960.[7]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The name \"Mount Everest\" was first proposed in this 1856 speech, later published in 1857, in which the mountain was first confirmed as the world's highest.\nThe Tibetan name for Everest is *Qomolangma* (ཇོ་མོ་གླང་མ, lit. \"Holy Mother\"). The name was first recorded with a Chinese transcription on the 1721 Kangxi Atlas during the reign of Emperor Kangxi of Qing China, and then appeared as *Tchoumour Lancma* on a 1733 map published in Paris by the French geographer D'Anville based on the former map.[8] The Tibetan name is also popularly romanised as *Chomolungma* and (in Wylie) as *Jo-mo-glang-ma*.[13]\n\n\nThe official Chinese transcription is 珠穆朗玛峰 (t 珠穆朗瑪峰), whose pinyin form is *Zhūmùlǎngmǎ Fēng*. While other Chinese names were used, including *Shèngmǔ Fēng* (t 聖母峰, s 圣母峰, lit. \"Holy Mother Peak\"), these names were largely phased out when the Ministry of Internal Affairs of China issued a decree to adopt a sole name in May 1952.[14]\n\n\nOther documented local names include \"Deodungha\" (\"Holy Mountain\"), but it is unclear whether it is commonly used.[15]\n\n\nIn 1849, the British survey wanted to preserve local names if possible (e.g., Kangchenjunga and Dhaulagiri), and Andrew Waugh, the British Surveyor General of India, argued that he could not find any commonly used local name, as his search for a local name was hampered by Nepal's and Tibet's exclusion of foreigners. Waugh argued that because there were many local names, it would be difficult to favour one name over all others; he decided that Peak XV should be named after British surveyor Sir George Everest, his predecessor as Surveyor General of India.[16][17][18] Everest himself opposed the name suggested by Waugh and told the Royal Geographical Society in 1857 that \"Everest\" could not be written in Hindi nor pronounced by \"the native of India\". Waugh's proposed name prevailed despite the objections, and in 1865, the Royal Geographical Society officially adopted Mount Everest as the name for the highest mountain in the world.[16][19] The modern pronunciation of Everest (/ˈɛvərɪst/)[20] is different from Sir George's pronunciation of his surname (/ˈiːvrɪst/ *EEV-rist*).[21][*verification needed*] In the late 19th century, many European cartographers incorrectly believed that a native name for the mountain was Gaurishankar, a mountain between Kathmandu and Everest.[22]\n\n\nIn the early 1960s, the Nepali government coined the Nepali name *Sagarmāthā* (IAST transcription) or *Sagar-Matha*[23] (सगर-माथा, [sʌɡʌrmatʰa], lit. \"goddess of the sky\"[24]),[25] which means \"the Head in the Great Blue Sky\", being derived from सगर (sagar), meaning \"sky\", and माथा (māthā), meaning \"head\".\n\n\n\n### Other names[edit]\n\n\n![](image)1890 graphic with the Himalayas, including Gaurisankar (Mount Everest) in the distance\n* Peak XV (British Empire's Survey)[16][17][18]\n* Old Darjeeling name: \"Deodungha\"[26]\n* \"Gauri Shankar\" or \"Gaurisankar\"; in modern times the name is used for a different peak about 30 miles (48 kilometres) away, but it was used occasionally until about 1900.[27]\n\n\n## Surveys[edit]\n\n\n### 19th-century surveys[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mount Everest relief map\nIn 1802, the British began the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India to fix the locations, heights, and names of the world's highest mountains. Starting in southern India, the survey teams moved northward using giant theodolites, each weighing 500 kg (1,100 lb) and requiring 12 men to carry, to measure heights as accurately as possible. They reached the Himalayan foothills by the 1830s, but Nepal was unwilling to allow the British to enter the country due to suspicions of their intentions. Several requests by the surveyors to enter Nepal were denied.[16]\n\n\nThe British were forced to continue their observations from Terai, a region south of Nepal which is parallel to the Himalayas. Conditions in Terai were difficult because of torrential rains and malaria. Three survey officers died from malaria while two others had to retire because of failing health.[16]\n\n\nNonetheless, in 1847, the British continued the survey and began detailed observations of the Himalayan peaks from observation stations up to 240 km (150 mi) distant. Weather restricted work to the last three months of the year. In November 1847, Andrew Scott Waugh, the British Surveyor General of India, made several observations from the Sawajpore station at the east end of the Himalayas. Kangchenjunga was then considered the highest peak in the world, and with interest, he noted a peak beyond it, about 230 km (140 mi) away. John Armstrong, one of Waugh's subordinates, also saw the peak from a site farther west and called it peak \"b\". Waugh would later write that the observations indicated that peak \"b\" was higher than Kangchenjunga, but given the great distance of the observations, closer observations were required for verification. The following year, Waugh sent a survey official back to Terai to make closer observations of peak \"b\", but clouds thwarted his attempts.[16]\n\n\nIn 1849, Waugh dispatched James Nicolson to the area, who made two observations from Jirol, 190 km (120 mi) away. Nicolson then took the largest theodolite and headed east, obtaining over 30 observations from five different locations, with the closest being 174 km (108 mi) from the peak.[16]\n\n\nNicolson retreated to Patna on the Ganges to perform the necessary calculations based on his observations. His raw data gave an average height of 9,200 m (30,200 ft) for peak \"b\", but this did not consider light refraction, which distorts heights. However, the number clearly indicated that peak \"b\" was higher than Kangchenjunga. Nicolson contracted malaria and was forced to return home without finishing his calculations. Michael Hennessy, one of Waugh's assistants, had begun designating peaks based on Roman numerals, with Kangchenjunga named Peak IX. Peak \"b\" now became known as Peak XV.[16]\n\n\nIn 1852, stationed at the survey headquarters in Dehradun, Radhanath Sikdar, an Indian mathematician and surveyor from Bengal was the first to identify Everest as the world's highest peak, using trigonometric calculations based on Nicolson's measurements.[28] An official announcement that Peak XV was the highest was delayed for several years as the calculations were repeatedly verified. Waugh began work on Nicolson's data in 1854, and along with his staff spent almost two years working on the numbers, having to deal with the problems of light refraction, barometric pressure, and temperature over the vast distances of the observations. Finally, in March 1856 he announced his findings in a letter to his deputy in Calcutta. Kangchenjunga was declared to be 8,582 m (28,156 ft), while Peak XV was given the height of 8,840 m (29,002 ft). Waugh concluded that Peak XV was \"most probably the highest in the world\".[16] Peak XV (measured in feet) was calculated to be exactly 29,000 ft (8,839.2 m) high, but was publicly declared to be 29,002 ft (8,839.8 m) in order to avoid the impression that an exact height of 29,000 feet (8,839.2 m) was nothing more than a rounded estimate.[29] Waugh is sometimes playfully credited with being \"the first person to put two feet on top of Mount Everest\".[30]\n\n\n\n### 20th-century surveys[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Published by the Survey of Nepal, this is Map 50 of the 57 map set at 1:50,000 scale \"attached to the main text on the First Joint Inspection Survey, 1979–80, Nepal-China border.\" At the top centre, a boundary line, identified as separating \"China\" and \"Nepal\", passes through the summit contour. The boundary here and for much of the China–Nepal border follows the main Himalayan watershed divide.\n![](image)Kangshung Face (the east face) as seen from orbit\nIn 1856, Andrew Waugh announced Everest (then known as Peak XV) as 8,840 m (29,002 ft) high, after several years of calculations based on observations made by the Great Trigonometrical Survey.[31] \nFrom 1952 to 1954, the Survey of India, using triangulation methods, determined that the height of Everest was 8,847.73 m (29,028 ft).[32] In 1975 it was subsequently reaffirmed by a Chinese measurement of 8,848.13 m (29,029.30 ft).[33] In both cases the snow cap, not the rock head, was measured.\nThe 8,848 m (29,029 ft) height given was officially recognised by Nepal and China.[34] Nepal planned a new survey in 2019 to determine if the April 2015 Nepal earthquake affected the height of the mountain.[35]\n\n\nIn May 1999, an American Everest expedition directed by Bradford Washburn anchored a GPS unit into the highest bedrock. A rock head elevation of 8,850 m (29,035 ft), and a snow/ice elevation 1 m (3 ft) higher, were obtained via this device.[36] Although as of 2001, it has not been officially recognised by Nepal,[37] this figure is widely quoted. Geoid uncertainty casts doubt upon the accuracy claimed by both the 1999 and 2005 (see § 21st-century surveys) surveys.[38]\n\n\nIn 1955, a detailed photogrammetric map (at a scale of 1:50,000) of the Khumbu region, including the south side of Mount Everest, was made by Erwin Schneider as part of the 1955 International Himalayan Expedition, which also attempted Lhotse.\n\n\nIn the late 1980s, an even more detailed topographic map of the Everest area was made under the direction of Bradford Washburn, using extensive aerial photography.[39]\n\n\n\n### 21st-century surveys[edit]\n\n\nOn 9 October 2005, after several months of measurement and calculation, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping announced the height of Everest as 8,844.43 m (29,017.16 ft) with accuracy of ±0.21 m (8.3 in), claiming it was the most accurate and precise measurement to date.[40] This height is based on the highest point of rock and not the snow and ice covering it. The Chinese team measured a snow-ice depth of 3.5 m (11 ft),[33] which is in agreement with a net elevation of 8,848 m (29,029 ft). An argument arose between China and Nepal as to whether the official height should be the rock height (8,844 m, China) or the snow height (8,848 m, Nepal). In 2010, both sides agreed that the height of Everest is 8,848 m, and Nepal recognises China's claim that the rock height of Everest is 8,844 m.[41] On 8 December 2020, it was jointly announced by the two countries that the new official height is 8,848.86 metres (29,031.7 ft).[42][43]\n\n\nIt is thought that the plate tectonics of the area are adding to the height and moving the summit northeastwards. Two accounts suggest the rates of change are 4 mm (0.16 in) per year vertically and 3 to 6 mm (0.12 to 0.24 in) per year horizontally,[36][44] but another account mentions more lateral movement (27 mm or 1.1 in),[45] and even shrinkage has been suggested.[46]\n\n\n\n### Comparisons[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of highest mountains on Earth.\n\nThe summit of Everest is the point at which Earth's surface reaches the greatest distance above sea level. Several other mountains are sometimes claimed to be the \"tallest mountains on Earth\". Mauna Kea in Hawaii is tallest when measured from its base;[note 5] it rises over 10,200 m (33,464.6 ft) when measured from its base on the mid-ocean floor, but only attains 4,205 m (13,796 ft) above sea level.\n\n\nBy the same measure of base to summit, Denali, in Alaska, formerly known as Mount McKinley, is taller than Everest as well.[note 5] Despite its height above sea level of only 6,190 m (20,308 ft), Denali sits atop a sloping plain with elevations from 300 to 900 m (980 to 2,950 ft), yielding a height above base in the range of 5,300 to 5,900 m (17,400 to 19,400 ft); a commonly quoted figure is 5,600 m (18,400 ft).[47][48] By comparison, reasonable base elevations for Everest range from 4,200 m (13,800 ft) on the south side to 5,200 m (17,100 ft) on the Tibetan Plateau, yielding a height above base in the range of 3,650 to 4,650 m (11,980 to 15,260 ft).[39]\n\n\nThe summit of Chimborazo in Ecuador is 2,168 m (7,113 ft) farther from Earth's centre (6,384.4 km, 3,967.1 mi) than that of Everest (6,382.3 km, 3,965.8 mi), because the Earth bulges at the equator.[49] This is despite Chimborazo having a peak 6,268 m (20,564.3 ft) above sea level versus Mount Everest's 8,848 m (29,028.9 ft).\n\n\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mount Everest with snow melted, showing upper geologic layers in bands\nGeologists have subdivided the rocks comprising Mount Everest into three units called formations.[50][51] Each formation is separated from the other by low-angle faults, called detachments, along which they have been thrust southward over each other. From the summit of Mount Everest to its base these rock units are the Qomolangma Formation, the North Col Formation, and the Rongbuk Formation.\n\n\nThe Qomolangma Formation, also known as the Jolmo Lungama Formation,[52] runs from the summit to the top of the Yellow Band, about 8,600 m (28,200 ft) above sea level. It consists of greyish to dark grey or white, parallel laminated and bedded, Ordovician limestone interlayered with subordinate beds of recrystallised dolomite with argillaceous laminae and siltstone. Gansser first reported finding microscopic fragments of crinoids in this limestone.[53][54] Later petrographic analysis of samples of the limestone from near the summit revealed them to be composed of carbonate pellets and finely fragmented remains of trilobites, crinoids, and ostracods. Other samples were so badly sheared and recrystallised that their original constituents could not be determined. A thick, white-weathering thrombolite bed that is 60 m (200 ft) thick comprises the foot of the \"Third Step\", and base of the summit pyramid of Everest. This bed, which crops out starting about 70 m (230 ft) below the summit of Mount Everest, consists of sediments trapped, bound, and cemented by the biofilms of micro-organisms, especially cyanobacteria, in shallow marine waters. The Qomolangma Formation is broken up by several high-angle faults that terminate at the low angle normal fault, the Qomolangma Detachment. This detachment separates it from the underlying Yellow Band. The lower five metres of the Qomolangma Formation overlying this detachment are very highly deformed.[50][51][55]\n\n\nThe bulk of Mount Everest, between 7,000 and 8,600 m (23,000 and 28,200 ft), consists of the North Col Formation, of which the Yellow Band forms the upper part between 8,200 to 8,600 m (26,900 to 28,200 ft). The Yellow Band consists of intercalated beds of Middle Cambrian diopside-epidote-bearing marble, which weathers a distinctive yellowish brown, and muscovite-biotite phyllite and semischist. Petrographic analysis of marble collected from about 8,300 m (27,200 ft) found it to consist as much as five per cent of the ghosts of recrystallised crinoid ossicles. The upper five metres of the Yellow Band lying adjacent to the Qomolangma Detachment is badly deformed. A 5–40 cm (2.0–15.7 in) thick fault breccia separates it from the overlying Qomolangma Formation.[50][51][55]\n\n\nThe remainder of the North Col Formation, exposed between 7,000 to 8,200 m (23,000 to 26,900 ft) on Mount Everest, consists of interlayered and deformed schist, phyllite, and minor marble. Between 7,600 and 8,200 m (24,900 and 26,900 ft), the North Col Formation consists chiefly of biotite-quartz phyllite and chlorite-biotite phyllite intercalated with minor amounts of biotite-sericite-quartz schist. Between 7,000 and 7,600 m (23,000 and 24,900 ft), the lower part of the North Col Formation consists of biotite-quartz schist intercalated with epidote-quartz schist, biotite-calcite-quartz schist, and thin layers of quartzose marble. These metamorphic rocks appear to be the result of the metamorphism of Middle to Early Cambrian deep sea flysch composed of interbedded, mudstone, shale, clayey sandstone, calcareous sandstone, graywacke, and sandy limestone. The base of the North Col Formation is a regional low-angle normal fault called the \"Lhotse detachment\".[50][51][55]\n\n\nBelow 7,000 m (23,000 ft), the Rongbuk Formation underlies the North Col Formation and forms the base of Mount Everest. It consists of sillimanite-K-feldspar grade schist and gneiss intruded by numerous sills and dikes of leucogranite ranging in thickness from 1 cm to 1,500 m (0.4 in to 4,900 ft).[51][56] These leucogranites are part of a belt of Late Oligocene–Miocene intrusive rocks known as the Higher Himalayan leucogranite. They formed as the result of partial melting of Paleoproterozoic to Ordovician high-grade metasedimentary rocks of the Higher Himalayan Sequence about 20 to 24 million years ago during the subduction of the Indian Plate.[57]\n\n\nMount Everest consists of sedimentary and metamorphic rocks that have been faulted southward over continental crust composed of Archean granulites of the Indian Plate during the Cenozoic collision of India with Asia.[58][59][60] Current interpretations argue that the Qomolangma and North Col formations consist of marine sediments that accumulated within the continental shelf of the northern passive continental margin of India before it collided with Asia. The Cenozoic collision of India with Asia subsequently deformed and metamorphosed these strata as it thrust them southward and upward.[61][62] The Rongbuk Formation consists of a sequence of high-grade metamorphic and granitic rocks that were derived from the alteration of high-grade metasedimentary rocks. During the collision of India with Asia, these rocks were thrust downward and to the north as they were overridden by other strata; heated, metamorphosed, and partially melted at depths of over 15 to 20 kilometres (9.3 to 12.4 mi) below sea level; and then forced upward to surface by thrusting towards the south between two major detachments.[63] The Himalayas are rising by about 5 mm per year.\n\n\n\n### IUGS geological heritage site[edit]\n\n\nIn respect of the recognition of the \"highest rocks on the planet\" as fossiliferous, marine limestone, the Ordovician Rocks of Mount Everest were included by the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) in its assemblage of 100 geological heritage sites around the world in a listing published in October 2022. The organisation defines an IUGS Geological Heritage Site as \"a key place with geological elements and/or processes of international scientific relevance, used as a reference, and/or with a substantial contribution to the development of geological sciences through history.\"[64]\n\n\n\n## Flora and fauna[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A yak at around 4,790 m (15,720 ft)\nThere is very little native flora or fauna on Everest. A type of moss grows at 6,480 metres (21,260 ft) on Mount Everest and it may be the highest altitude plant species.[65] An alpine cushion plant called *Arenaria* is known to grow below 5,500 metres (18,000 ft) in the region.[66] According to the study based on satellite data from 1993 to 2018, vegetation is expanding in the Everest region. Researchers have found plants in areas that were previously deemed bare.[67]\n\n\nA minute black jumping spider of the genus *Euophrys* has been found at elevations as high as 6,700 metres (22,000 ft),[68] possibly making it the highest confirmed non-microscopic permanent resident on Earth. Another Euophrys species, *E. everestensis*, has been found at 5,030 metres (16,500 ft), and may feed on insects that have been blown there by the wind.[68] There is a high likelihood of microscopic life at even higher altitudes.\n\n\nThe bar-headed goose migrates over the Himalayas and have been seen flying at the higher altitudes of the mountain.[69] In 1953, George Lowe (part of the expedition of Tenzing and Hillary) said that he saw bar-headed geese flying over Everest's summit.[70] Another bird species, the chough, have been spotted as high as the South Col at 7,920 metres (25,980 ft)[71] and yellow-billed choughs have been seen as high as 7,900 metres (26,000 ft).[69]\n\n\nYaks are often used to haul gear for Mount Everest climbs. They can haul around 100 kg (220 pounds), have thick fur and large lungs.[66] Other animals in the region include the Himalayan tahr, which is sometimes the prey of the snow leopard.[72] The Himalayan black bear can be found up to about 4,300 metres (14,000 ft) and the red panda is also present in the region.[73] One expedition found a surprising range of species in the region including a pika and ten new species of ants.[74]\n\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\nMount Everest has an ice cap climate (Köppen *EF*) with all months averaging well below freezing.[note 6]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Mount Everest\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Mean minimum °C (°F)\n | −36(−33)\n | −35(−31)\n | −32(−26)\n | −31(−24)\n | −25(−13)\n | −20(−4)\n | −18(0)\n | −18(0)\n | −21(−6)\n | −27(−17)\n | −30(−22)\n | −34(−29)\n | −36(−33)\n |\n| Source: [75] |\n\n### Climate change[edit]\n\n\nThe base camp for Everest expeditions based out of Nepal is located by Khumbu Glacier, which is rapidly thinning and destabilizing due to climate change, making it unsafe for climbers. As recommended by the committee formed by Nepal's government to facilitate and monitor mountaineering in the Everest region, Taranath Adhikari—the director general of Nepal's tourism department—said they have plans to move the base camp to a lower altitude. This would mean a longer distance for climbers between the base camp and Camp 1. However, the present base camp is still useful and could still serve its purpose for three to four years. The move may happen by 2024, per officials.[76]\n\n\n\n### Meteorology[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Atmospheric pressure comparison\n | Pressure\n | Reference\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| kilopascal | psi |\n| Olympus Mons summit\n | 0.03\n | 0.0044\n | –\n |\n| Mars average\n | 0.6\n | 0.087\n | –\n |\n| Hellas Planitia bottom\n | 1.16\n | 0.168\n | –\n |\n| Armstrong limit | 6.25\n | 0.906\n | –\n |\n| Mount Everest summit\n | 33.7\n | 4.89\n | [77] |\n| Earth sea level | 101.3\n | 14.69\n | –\n |\n| Dead Sea level\n | 106.7\n | 15.48\n | [78] |\n| Surface of Venus | 9,200\n | 1,330\n | [79] |\n\n\nIn 2008, a new weather station at about 8,000 m (26,000 ft) elevation went online.[80] The station's first data in May 2008 were air temperature −17 °C (1 °F), relative humidity 41.3 per cent, atmospheric pressure 382.1 hPa (38.21 kPa), wind direction 262.8°, wind speed 12.8 m/s (28.6 mph, 46.1 km/h), global solar radiation 711.9 watts/m2, solar UVA radiation 30.4 W/m2.[80] The project was orchestrated by Stations at High Altitude for Research on the Environment (SHARE), which also placed the Mount Everest webcam in 2011.[80][81] The solar-powered weather station is on the South Col.[82]\n\n\nMount Everest extends into the upper troposphere and penetrates the stratosphere.[83] The air pressure at the summit is generally about one-third what it is at sea level. The altitude can expose the summit to the fast and freezing winds of the jet stream.[84] Winds commonly attain 160 km/h (100 mph);[85] in February 2004, a wind speed of 280 km/h (175 mph) was recorded at the summit.\n\n\nThese winds can hamper or endanger climbers, by blowing them into chasms[85] or (by Bernoulli's principle) by lowering the air pressure further, reducing available oxygen by up to 14 per cent.[84][86] To avoid the harshest winds, climbers typically aim for a 7- to 10-day window in the spring and fall when the Asian monsoon season is starting up or ending.\n\n\n\n## Expeditions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **appears to be slanted towards recent events.** Please try to keep recent events in historical perspective and add more content related to non-recent events. *(July 2022)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*\n |\n\n\n![](image)Climbers below the Geneva Spur\n![](image)Reunion of the 1953 British team\nSee also: List of people who died climbing Mount Everest\n\nBecause Mount Everest is the highest mountain in the world, it has attracted considerable attention and climbing attempts. Whether the mountain was climbed in ancient times is unknown. It may have been climbed in 1924, although this has never been confirmed, as neither of the men making the attempt returned. Several climbing routes have been established over several decades of climbing expeditions to the mountain.[87][88][*better source needed*]\n\n\n\n### Overview[edit]\n\n\nEverest's summit is first known to have been reached by a human in 1953, and interest from climbers increased thereafter.[89] Despite the effort and attention poured into expeditions, only about 200 people had summited by 1987.[89] Everest remained a difficult climb for decades, even for serious attempts by professional climbers and large national expeditions, which were the norm until the commercial era began in the 1990s.[90]\n\n\nBy March 2012, Everest had been climbed 5,656 times with 223 deaths.[91] Although lower mountains have longer or steeper climbs, Everest is so high the jet stream can hit it. Climbers can be faced with winds beyond 320 km/h (200 mph) when the weather shifts.[92] At certain times of the year the jet stream shifts north, providing periods of relative calm at the mountain.[93] Other dangers include blizzards and avalanches.[93]\n\n\nBy 2013, The Himalayan Database recorded 6,871 summits by 4,042 different people.[94]\n\n\n\n### Early attempts[edit]\n\n\nIn 1885, Clinton Thomas Dent, president of the Alpine Club, suggested that climbing Mount Everest was possible in his book *Above the Snow Line*.[95]\n\n\nThe northern approach to the mountain was discovered by George Mallory and Guy Bullock on the initial 1921 British Reconnaissance Expedition. It was an exploratory expedition not equipped for a serious attempt to climb the mountain. With Mallory leading (and thus becoming the first European to set foot on Everest's flanks) they climbed the North Col to an altitude of 7,005 metres (22,982 ft). From there, Mallory espied a route to the top, but the party was unprepared to climb any further and descended.\n\n\nThe British returned for a 1922 expedition. George Finch climbed using oxygen for the first time. He ascended at a remarkable speed—290 metres (951 ft) per hour—and reached an altitude of 8,320 m (27,300 ft), the first time a human reported to climb higher than 8,000 m. Mallory and Col. Felix Norton made a second unsuccessful attempt.\n\n\nThe next expedition was in 1924. The initial attempt by Mallory and Geoffrey Bruce was aborted when weather conditions prevented the establishment of Camp VI. The next attempt was that of Norton and Somervell, who climbed without oxygen and in perfect weather, traversing the North Face into the Great Couloir. Norton managed to reach 8,550 m (28,050 ft), though he ascended only 30 m (98 ft) or so in the last hour. Mallory rustled up oxygen equipment for a last-ditch effort. He chose young Andrew Irvine as his partner.[96]\n\n\n\n![](image)1952 documentary\nOn 8 June 1924, George Mallory and Andrew Irvine made an attempt on the summit via the North Col-North Ridge-Northeast Ridge route from which they never returned. On 1 May 1999, the Mallory and Irvine Research Expedition found Mallory's body on the North Face in a snow basin below and to the west of the traditional site of Camp VI. Controversy has raged in the mountaineering community whether one or both of them reached the summit 29 years before the confirmed ascent and safe descent of Everest by Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953.\n\n\nIn 1933, Lady Houston, a British millionairess, funded the Houston Everest Flight of 1933, which saw a formation of two aeroplanes led by the Marquess of Clydesdale fly over the Everest summit.[97][98][99][100]\n\n\nEarly expeditions—such as Charles Bruce's in the 1920s and Hugh Ruttledge's two unsuccessful attempts in 1933 and 1936—tried to ascend the mountain from Tibet, via the North Face. Access was closed from the north to Western expeditions in 1950 after China took control of Tibet. In 1950, Bill Tilman and a small party which included Charles Houston, Oscar Houston, and Betsy Cowles undertook an exploratory expedition to Everest through Nepal along the route which has now become the standard approach to Everest from the south.[101]\n\n\nThe 1952 Swiss Mount Everest Expedition, led by Edouard Wyss-Dunant, was granted permission to attempt a climb from Nepal. It established a route through the Khumbu icefall and ascended to the South Col at an elevation of 7,986 m (26,201 ft). Raymond Lambert and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay were able to reach an elevation of about 8,595 m (28,199 ft) on the southeast ridge, setting a new climbing altitude record. Tenzing's experience was useful when he was hired to be part of the British expedition in 1953.[102] The Swiss decided to make another post-monsoon attempt in the autumn; they made it to the South Col but were driven back by winter winds and severe cold.[103][104]\n\n\n\n### First successful ascent by Tenzing and Hillary, 1953[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1953 British Mount Everest expedition\n\n![](image)Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay\nIn 1953, a ninth British expedition, led by John Hunt, returned to Nepal. Hunt selected two climbing pairs to attempt to reach the summit. The first pair, Tom Bourdillon and Charles Evans, came within 100 m (330 ft) of the summit on 26 May 1953, but turned back after running into oxygen problems. As planned, their work in route finding and breaking trail and their oxygen caches were of great aid to the following pair. Two days later, the expedition made its second assault on the summit with the second climbing pair: the New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay, a Nepali Sherpa climber. They reached the summit at 11:30 am local time on 29 May 1953 via the South Col route. At the time, both acknowledged it as a team effort by the whole expedition, but Tenzing revealed a few years later that Hillary had put his foot on the summit first.[105] They paused at the summit to take photographs and buried a few sweets and a small cross in the snow before descending.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nNews of the expedition's success reached London on the morning of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation, 2 June. A few days later, the Queen gave orders that Hunt (a Briton) and Hillary (a New Zealander) were to be knighted in the Order of the British Empire for the ascent.[106] Tenzing, a Nepali Sherpa who was a citizen of India, was granted the George Medal by the UK. Hunt was ultimately made a life peer in Britain, while Hillary became a founding member of the Order of New Zealand.[107] Hillary and Tenzing have also been recognised in Nepal. In 2009, statues were raised in their honour, and in 2014, Hillary Peak and Tenzing Peak were named for them.[108][109]\n\n\n\n### 1950s–1960s[edit]\n\n\nOn 23 May 1956, Ernst Schmied and Juerg Marmet ascended.[110] This was followed by Dölf Reist and Hans-Rudolf von Gunten on 24 May 1957.[110] Wang Fuzhou, Gonpo and Qu Yinhua of China made the first reported ascent of the peak from the North Ridge on 25 May 1960.[7] The first American to climb Everest, Jim Whittaker, joined by Nawang Gombu, reached the summit on 1 May 1963.[111][112]\n\n\n\n### 1970s[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 1970 Mount Everest disaster\n\nIn 1970, Japanese mountaineers conducted a major expedition. The centrepiece was a large \"siege\"-style expedition led by Saburo Matsukata, working on finding a new route up the southwest face.[113] Another element of the expedition was an attempt to ski Mount Everest.[90] Despite a staff of over one hundred people and a decade of planning work, the expedition suffered eight deaths and failed to summit via the planned routes.[90] However, Japanese expeditions did enjoy some successes. For example, Yuichiro Miura became the first man to ski down Everest from the South Col—he descended nearly 1,300 vertical metres (4,200 ft) from the South Col before falling with extreme injuries. Another success was an expedition that put four on the summit via the South Col route.[90][114][115] Miura's exploits became the subject of film, and he went on to become the oldest person to summit Mount Everest in 2003 at age 70 and again in 2013 at the age of 80.[116]\n\n\n\nIn 1975, Junko Tabei, a Japanese woman, became the first woman to summit Mount Everest.[90]\n\n\nThe 1975 British Mount Everest Southwest Face expedition led and organised by Chris Bonington made the first ascent of the south west face of Everest from the western cwm. \n\n\nThe 1976 British and Nepalese Army Expedition to Everest led by Tony Streather put Bronco Lane and Brummy Stokes on the summit by the normal route.\n\n\nIn 1978, Reinhold Messner and Peter Habeler made the first ascent of Everest without supplemental oxygen.\n\n\n\n### 1979/1980: Winter Himalaism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Confirmation of the summit obtained by Nepal's Ministry of Tourism\nThe Polish climber Andrzej Zawada headed the first winter ascent of Mount Everest, the first winter ascent of an eight-thousander. The team of 20 Polish climbers and 4 Sherpas established a base camp on Khumbu Glacier in early January 1980. On 15 January, the team managed to set up Camp III at 7150 metres above sea level, but further action was stopped by hurricane-force winds. The weather improved after 11 February, when Leszek Cichy, Walenty Fiut and Krzysztof Wielicki set up camp IV on South Col (7906 m). Cichy and Wielicki started the final ascent at 6:50 am on 17 February. At 2:40 pm Andrzej Zawada at base camp heard the climbers' voices over the radio – \"We are on the summit! The strong wind blows all the time. It is unimaginably cold.\"[117][118][119][120] The successful winter ascent of Mount Everest started a new decade of Winter Himalaism, which became a Polish specialisation. After 1980 Poles did ten first winter ascents on 8000 metre peaks, which earned Polish climbers a reputation of \"Ice Warriors\".[121][118][122][123]\n\n\n\n### Lho La tragedy, 1989[edit]\n\n\nIn May 1989, Polish climbers under the leadership of Eugeniusz Chrobak organised an international expedition to Mount Everest on a difficult western ridge. Ten Poles and nine foreigners participated, but ultimately only the Poles remained in the attempt for the summit. On 24 May, Chrobak and Andrzej Marciniak, starting from camp V at 8,200 m, overcame the ridge and reached the summit. But on 27 May, during an avalanche from the side of Khumbutse near the Lho La pass, four Polish climbers were killed: Mirosław Dąsal, Mirosław Gardzielewski, Zygmunt Andrzej Heinrich and Wacław Otręba. The following day, due to his injuries, Chrobak also died. Marciniak, who was also injured, was saved by a rescue expedition in which Artur Hajzer and New Zealanders Gary Ball and Rob Hall took part. In the organisation of the rescue expedition they took part, inter alia Reinhold Messner, Elizabeth Hawley, Carlos Carsolio and the US consul.[124]\n\n\n\n### 1996 disaster[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1996 Mount Everest disaster\n\nOn 10 and 11 May 1996, eight climbers died after several guided expeditions were caught in a blizzard high up on the mountain during a summit attempt on 10 May. During the 1996 season, 15 people died while climbing on Mount Everest. These were the highest death tolls for a single weather event, and for a single season, until the sixteen deaths in the 2014 Mount Everest avalanche. The guiding disaster gained wide publicity and raised questions about the commercialisation of climbing and the safety of guiding clients on Mount Everest.\n\n\nJournalist Jon Krakauer, on assignment from *Outside* magazine, was in one of the affected guided parties, and afterward published the bestseller *Into Thin Air*, which related his experience. Krakauer was critical of guide Anatoli Boukreev in his recollection of the expedition.[125][126] A year later, Boukreev co-authored *The Climb*, in part as a rebuttal of Krakauer's portrayal.[127] The dispute sparked a debate within the climbing community. Boukreev was later awarded The American Alpine Club's David Sowles Award for his rescue efforts on the expedition.[126]\n\n\nIn May 2004, physicist Kent Moore and surgeon John L. Semple, both researchers from the University of Toronto, told *New Scientist* magazine that an analysis of weather conditions on 11 May suggested that weather caused oxygen levels to plunge about 14 per cent.[128][129]\n\n\nOne of the survivors was Beck Weathers, an American client of New Zealand–based guide service Adventure Consultants. Weathers was left for dead about 275 metres (900 feet) from Camp 4 at 7,950 metres (26,085 feet). After spending a night on the mountain, Weathers managed to make it back to Camp 4 with massive frostbite and vision impaired due to snow blindness.[130] When he arrived at Camp 4, fellow climbers considered his condition terminal and left him in a tent to die overnight.[131]\n\n\nWeathers' condition had not improved and an immediate descent to a lower elevation was deemed essential.[131] A helicopter rescue was out of the question: Camp 4 was higher than the rated ceiling of any available helicopter. Weathers was lowered to Camp 2. Eventually, a helicopter rescue was organised thanks to the Nepali Army.[130][131]\n\n\nThe storm's impact on climbers on the North Ridge of Everest, where several climbers also died, was detailed in a first-hand account by British filmmaker and writer Matt Dickinson in his book *The Other Side of Everest*. Sixteen-year-old Mark Pfetzer was on the climb and wrote about it in his account, *Within Reach: My Everest Story*.\n\n\nThe 2015 feature film *Everest*, directed by Baltasar Kormákur, is based on the events of this guiding disaster.[132]\n\n\n\n### 2006 mountaineering season[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2006 fatalities\n |\n| --- |\n| Deaths[133] | Nation[134] |\n| Tuk Bahadur Thapa Masa\n | ![](image)   Nepal |\n| Igor Plyushkin\n | ![](image) Russia |\n| Vitor Negrete | ![](image) Brazil |\n| David Sharp | ![](image) United Kingdom |\n| Thomas Weber\n | ![](image) Germany |\n| Tomas Olsson | ![](image) Sweden |\n| Jacques-Hugues Letrange\n | ![](image) France |\n| Ang Phinjo\n | ![](image)   Nepal |\n| \\*Pavel Kalny | ![](image) Czech Republic |\n| Lhakpa Tseri[135] | ![](image)   Nepal |\n| Dawa Temba[135] | ![](image)   Nepal |\n| Sri Kishan[134] | ![](image) India |\n| *\\*Lhotse face fatality* |\n\n\n![](image)Small avalanche on Everest, 2006\nIn 2006, 12 people died. One death in particular (see below) triggered an international debate and years of discussion about climbing ethics.[136] The season was also remembered for the rescue of Lincoln Hall who had been left by his climbing team and declared dead, but was later discovered alive and survived being helped off the mountain.\n\n\n\n#### David Sharp ethics controversy, 2006[edit]\n\n\nThere was an international controversy about the death of a solo British climber David Sharp, who attempted to climb Mount Everest in 2006 but died in his attempt. The story broke out of the mountaineering community into popular media, with a series of interviews, allegations, and critiques. The question was whether climbers that season had left a man to die and whether he could have been saved. He was said to have attempted to summit Mount Everest by himself with no Sherpa or guide and fewer oxygen bottles than considered normal.[137] He went with a low-budget Nepali guide firm that only provides support up to Base Camp, after which climbers go as a \"loose group\", offering a high degree of independence. The manager at Sharp's guide support said Sharp did not take enough oxygen for his summit attempt and did not have a Sherpa guide.[138] It is less clear who knew Sharp was in trouble, and if they did know, whether they were qualified or capable of helping him.[137]\n\n\nDouble-amputee climber Mark Inglis said in an interview with the press on 23 May 2006, that his climbing party, and many others, had passed Sharp, on 15 May, sheltering under a rock overhang 450 metres (1,480 ft) below the summit, without attempting a rescue.[139] Inglis said 40 people had passed by Sharp, but he might have been overlooked as climbers assumed Sharp was the corpse nicknamed \"Green Boots\",[140] but Inglis was not aware that Turkish climbers had tried to help Sharp despite being in the process of helping an injured woman down (a Turkish woman, Burçak Poçan). There has also been some discussion about Himex in the commentary on Inglis and Sharp. In regards to Inglis's initial comments, he later revised certain details because he had been interviewed while he was \"...physically and mentally exhausted, and in a lot of pain. He had suffered severe frostbite – he later had five fingertips amputated.\" When they went through Sharp's possessions they found a receipt for US$7,490, believed to be the whole financial cost.[141] Comparatively, most expeditions are between $35,000 to US$100,000 plus an additional $20,000 in other expenses that range from gear to bonuses.[142] It was estimated on 14 May that Sharp summited Mount Everest and began his descent down, but 15 May he was in trouble but being passed by climbers on their way up and down.[143] On 15 May 2006 it is believed he was suffering from hypoxia and was about 300 m (1,000 ft) from the summit on the North Side route.[143]\n\n\n\n\n> Dawa from Arun Treks also gave oxygen to David and tried to help him move, repeatedly, for perhaps an hour. But he could not get David to stand alone or even stand to rest on his shoulders, and crying, Dawa had to leave him too. Even with two Sherpas, it was not going to be possible to get David down the tricky sections below.\n> \n> — Jamie McGuiness[144]\n> \n\n\nBeck Weathers of the 1996 Mount Everest disaster said that those who are dying are often left behind and that he himself had been left for dead twice but was able to keep walking.[145] *The Tribune* of Chandigarh, India quoted someone who described what happened to Sharp as \"the most shameful act in the history of mountaineering\".[146] In addition to Sharp's death, at least nine other climbers perished that year, including multiple Sherpas working for various guiding companies.[147]\n\n\n\n\n> You are never on your own. There are climbers everywhere.\n> \n> — David Sharp[148]\n> \n\n\nMuch of this controversy was captured by the *Discovery Channel* while filming the television program *Everest: Beyond the Limit*. A crucial decision affecting the fate of Sharp is shown in the program, where an early returning climber, Lebanese adventurer Maxim Chaya, is descending from the summit and radios to his base camp manager (Russell Brice) that he has found a frostbitten and unconscious climber in distress. Chaya is unable to identify Sharp, who had chosen to climb solo without any support and so did not identify himself to other climbers. The base camp manager assumes that Sharp is part of a group that has already calculated that they must abandon him, and informs his lone climber that there is no chance of him being able to help Sharp by himself. As Sharp's condition deteriorates through the day and other descending climbers pass him, his opportunities for rescue diminish: his legs and feet curl from frostbite, preventing him from walking; the later descending climbers are lower on oxygen and lack the strength to offer aid; time runs out for any Sherpas to return and rescue him.\n\n\nDavid Sharp's body remained just below the summit on the Chinese side next to \"Green Boots\"; they shared a space in a small rock cave that was an ad hoc tomb for them.[143] Sharp's body was removed from the cave in 2007, according to the BBC,[149] and since 2014, Green Boots has been missing, presumably removed or buried.[6]\n\n\n\n#### Lincoln Hall rescue, 2006[edit]\n\n\nAs the Sharp debate kicked off on 26 May 2006, Australian climber Lincoln Hall was found alive after being left for dead the day before.[150] He was found by a party of four climbers (Dan Mazur, Andrew Brash, Myles Osborne and Jangbu Sherpa) who, giving up their own summit attempt, stayed with Hall and descended with him and a party of 11 Sherpas sent up to carry him down. Hall later fully recovered. His team assumed he had died from cerebral edema, and they were instructed to cover him with rocks.[150] There were no rocks around to do this and he was abandoned.[151] The erroneous information of his death was passed on to his family. The next day he was discovered alive by another party.[151]\n\n\n\n\n> I was shocked to see a guy without gloves, hat, oxygen bottles or sleeping bag at sunrise at 28,200 feet [8,600 m] height, just sitting up there.\n> \n> — Dan Mazur[151]\n> \n\n\nLincoln greeted his fellow mountaineers with this:[151]\n\n\n\n\n> I imagine you are surprised to see me here.\n> \n> — Lincoln Hall[151]\n> \n\n\nLincoln Hall went on to live for several more years, often giving talks about his near-death experience and rescue, before dying from unrelated medical issues in 2012 at the age of 56 (born in 1955).[151]\n\n\n\n### 2007[edit]\n\n\nOn 21 May 2007, Canadian climber Meagan McGrath initiated the successful high-altitude rescue of Nepali Usha Bista. Recognising this rescue, Major McGrath was selected as a 2011 recipient of the Sir Edmund Hillary Foundation of Canada Humanitarian Award, which recognises a Canadian who has personally or administratively contributed a significant service or act in the Himalayan Region of Nepal.[152]\n\n\n\n### Ascent statistics up to 2010 season[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ascents of Mount Everest by year through 2010\n![](image)The sun rising on Everest in 2011\nBy the end of the 2010 climbing season, there had been 5,104 ascents to the summit by about 3,142 individuals, with 77 per cent of these ascents being accomplished since 2000.[153] The summit was achieved in 7 of the 22 years from 1953 to 1974 and was not missed between 1975 and 2014.[153] In 2007, the record number of 633 ascents was recorded, by 350 climbers and 253 sherpas.[153]\n\n\nAn illustration of the explosion of popularity of Everest is provided by the numbers of daily ascents. Analysis of the 1996 Mount Everest disaster shows that part of the blame was on the bottleneck caused by a large number of climbers (33 to 36) attempting to summit on the same day; this was considered unusually high at the time. By comparison, on 23 May 2010, the summit of Mount Everest was reached by 169 climbers – more summits in a single day than in the cumulative 31 years from the first successful summit in 1953 through 1983.[153]\n\n\nThere have been 219 fatalities recorded on Mount Everest from the 1922 British Mount Everest Expedition through the end of 2010, a rate of 4.3 fatalities for every 100 summits (this is a general rate, and includes fatalities amongst support climbers, those who turned back before the peak, those who died en route to the peak and those who died while descending from the peak). Of the 219 fatalities, 58 (26.5 per cent) were climbers who had summited but did not complete their descent.[153] Though the rate of fatalities has decreased since the year 2000 (1.4 fatalities for every 100 summits, with 3938 summits since 2000), the significant increase in the total number of climbers still means 54 fatalities since 2000: 33 on the northeast ridge, 17 on the southeast ridge, 2 on the southwest face, and 2 on the north face.[153]\n\n\nNearly all attempts at the summit are done using one of the two main routes. The traffic seen by each route varies from year to year. In 2005–07, more than half of all climbers elected to use the more challenging, but cheaper northeast route. In 2008, the northeast route was closed by the Chinese government for the entire climbing season, and the only people able to reach the summit from the north that year were athletes responsible for carrying the Olympic torch for the 2008 Summer Olympics.[154] The route was closed to foreigners once again in 2009 in the run-up to the 50th anniversary of the Dalai Lama's exile.[155] These closures led to declining interest in the north route, and, in 2010, two-thirds of the climbers reached the summit from the south.[153]\n\n\n\n### 2010s[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Mount Everest in 2012 and Mount Everest in 2013\n\n![](image)Selfie on the summit, 2012\nThe 2010s were a time of new highs and lows for the mountain, with back-to-back disasters in 2013 and 2014 causing record deaths. In 2015 there were no summits for the first time in decades. However, other years set records for numbers of summits – 2013's record number of summiters, around 667, was surpassed in 2018 with around 800 summiting the peak,[156] and a subsequent record was set in 2019 with over 890 summiters.[157]\n\n\n\n\n\nYears in review summary\n| Year\n | Summiters\n | References\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2010\n | 543\n | [157] |\n| 2011\n | 538\n | [157] |\n| 2012 | 547\n | [158] |\n| 2013 | 658–670\n | [159][157] |\n| 2014\n | 106\n | [160] |\n| 2015\n | 0\n | [161][157] |\n| 2016 | 641\n | [162] |\n| 2017 | 648\n | [163] |\n| 2018 | 807\n | [156][164] |\n| 2019\n | approx. 891\n | [157] |\n\n\n\n### 2014 avalanche and season[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 Mount Everest avalanche\n\n![](image)Mount Everest, 2014\nOn 18 April 2014, an avalanche hit the area just below Base Camp 2 at around 01:00 UTC (06:30 local time) and at an elevation of about 5,900 metres (19,400 ft).[165] Sixteen people were killed in the avalanche (all Nepali guides) and nine more were injured.[166]\n\n\nDuring the season, a 13-year-old girl, Malavath Purna, reached the summit, becoming the youngest female climber to do so.[167] Additionally, one team used a helicopter to fly from South base camp to Camp 2 to avoid the Khumbu Icefall, then reached the Everest summit. This team had to use the south side because the Chinese had denied them a permit to climb. A team member (Jing Wang) donated US$30,000 to a local hospital.[168] She was named the Nepali \"International Mountaineer of the Year\".[168]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![](image)The location of the fatal ice avalanche on the 2014 route, and the revised 2015 route through the Khumbu\n\nOver 100 people summited Everest from China (Tibet region), and six from Nepal in the 2014 season.[169] This included 72-year-old Bill Burke, the Indian teenage girl, and a Chinese woman Jing Wang.[170] Another teen girl summiter was Ming Kipa Sherpa who summited with her elder sister Lhakpa Sherpa in 2003, and who had achieved the most times for woman to the summit of Mount Everest at that time.[171] (see also Santosh Yadav)\n\n\n\n### 2015 avalanche, earthquake, season[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2015 Mount Everest avalanches\n\n![](image)Everest, April 2015\n2015 was set to be a record-breaking season of climbs, with hundreds of permits issued in Nepal and many additional permits in Tibet (China). However, on 25 April 2015, an earthquake measuring 7.8 Mw triggered an avalanche that hit Everest Base Camp,[172] effectively shutting down the Everest climbing season.[173] 18 bodies were recovered from Mount Everest by the Indian Army mountaineering team.[174] The avalanche began on Pumori,[175] moved through the Khumbu Icefall on the southwest side of Mount Everest, and slammed into the South Base Camp.[176] 2015 was the first time since 1974 with no spring summits, as all climbing teams pulled out after the quakes and avalanche.[177][178] One of the reasons for this was the high probability of aftershocks (over 50 per cent according to the United States Geological Survey).[179] Just weeks after the first quake, the region was rattled again by a 7.3 magnitude quake and there were also many considerable aftershocks.[180]\n\n\nThe quakes trapped hundreds of climbers above the Khumbu icefall, and they had to be evacuated by helicopter as they ran low on supplies.[181] The quake shifted the route through the ice fall, making it essentially impassable to climbers.[181] Bad weather also made helicopter evacuation difficult.[181] The Everest tragedy was small compared to the impact overall on Nepal, with almost nine thousand dead[182][183] and about 22,000 injured.[182] In Tibet, by 28 April at least 25 had died, and 117 were injured.[184] By 29 April 2015, the Tibet Mountaineering Association (North/Chinese side) closed Everest and other peaks to climbing, stranding 25 teams and about 300 people on the north side of Everest.[185] On the south side, helicopters evacuated 180 people trapped at Camps 1 and 2.[186]\n\n\n\n#### Mountain re-opens in August 2015[edit]\n\n\nOn 24 August 2015, Nepal re-opened Everest to tourism including mountain climbers.[187] The only climber permit for the autumn season was awarded to Japanese climber Nobukazu Kuriki, who had tried four times previously to summit Everest without success. He made his fifth attempt in October, but had to give up just 700 m (2,300 ft) from the summit due to \"strong winds and deep snow\".[188][189] Kuriki noted the dangers of climbing Everest, having himself survived being stuck in a freezing snow hole for two days near the top, which came at the cost of all his fingertips and his thumb, lost to frostbite, which added further difficulty to his climb.[190]\n\n\nSome sections of the trail from Lukla to Everest Base Camp (Nepal) were damaged in the earthquakes earlier in the year and needed repairs to handle trekkers.[191]\n\n\n\n### 2016 season[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mount Everest in 2016\n\nHawley's database records 641 made it to the summit in early 2016.[192]\n\n\n\n### 2017 season[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mount Everest in 2017\n\n2017 was the biggest season yet, permit-wise, yielding hundreds of summiters and a handful of deaths.[193] On 27 May 2017, Kami Rita made his 21st climb to the summit with the Alpine Ascents Everest Expedition, one of three people in the World along with Apa Sherpa and Phurba Tashi Sherpa to make it to the summit of Mount Everest 21 times.[194][195] The season had a tragic start with the death of Ueli Steck of Switzerland, who died from a fall during a warm-up climb.[196] There was a continued discussion about the nature of possible changes to the Hillary Step.[197] Total summiters for 2017 was tallied up to be 648.[163] 449 summited via Nepal (from the South) and 120 from Chinese Tibet (North side).[198]\n\n\n\n### 2018[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mount Everest in 2018\n\n![](image)Mount Everest in the upper left (March 2018)\n807 climbers summited Mount Everest in 2018,[199] including 563 on the Nepal side and 240 from the Chinese Tibet side.[156] This broke the previous record for total summits in year from which was 667 in 2013, and one factor that aided in this was an especially long and clear weather window of 11 days during the critical spring climbing season.[156][200][164] Various records were broken, including a summit by double-amputee Xia Boyu, who undertook his climb after winning a court case in the Nepali Supreme Court.[156] There were no major disasters, but seven climbers died in various situations including several sherpas as well as international climbers.[156] Although record numbers of climbers reached the summit, old-time summiters that made expeditions in the 1980s lamented the crowding, feces, and cost.[200]\n\n\nHimalayan record keeper Elizabeth Hawley died in late January 2018.[201]\n\n\nFigures for the number of permits issued by Nepal range from 347[202] to 375.[203]\n\n\n\n### 2019[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2019 fatalities[204] |\n| --- |\n| Fatalities | Nationality\n |\n| Chris Daly\n | ![](image) United States |\n| Donald Cash\n | ![](image) United States |\n| Robin Fisher\n | ![](image) United Kingdom |\n| Druba Bista\n | ![](image)   Nepal |\n| Kevin Hynes\n | ![](image) Ireland |\n| Kalpana Dash\n | ![](image) India |\n| Anjali S.

Everest from the North side during April–May 2020, becoming the only climbers to summit the world's highest peak during the pandemic, at least through May. The team was there to re-measure the height of Mount Everest.[225]\n\n\nOn 12 May 2022, the first all-Black team summited Mt. Everest. Seven men and two women climbers from the U.S. and Kenya, guided by eight sherpas, comprised the expedition.[226]\n\n\n\n### 2023[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sunset view of Everest\nOn 18 May the second deaf person, Malaysian national Muhammad Hawari Hashim reached the top of Mount Everest.

He faced, among other penalties, a $22,000 fine and a possible four years in jail. In the end, he was allowed to return home but banned from mountaineering in Nepal for 10 years.[231]\n\n\nThe number of permits issued each year by Nepal is:[230][232]\n\n\n\n* 2008: 160\n* 2009: 220\n* 2010: 209\n* 2011: 225\n* 2012: 208\n* 2013: 316\n* 2014: 326 (extended for use through 2019)\n* 2015: 356 (extended for use through 2017)\n* 2016: 289\n* 2017: 366 to 373\n* 2018: 346\n* 2019: 381\n* 2020: 0 (no permits issued during the pandemic)\n* 2021: 408 (current record)[233][234]\n\n\nThe Chinese side in Tibet is also managed with permits for summiting Everest.[235] They did not issue permits in 2008, due to the Olympic torch relay being taken to the summit of Mount Everest.[236]\n\n\nIn March 2020, the governments of China and Nepal cancelled all climbing permits for Mount Everest due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[237][238] In April 2020, a group of Chinese mountaineers began an expedition from the Chinese side. The mountain remained closed on the Chinese side to all foreign climbers.[239] On 10 May 2021, a separation line was announced by Chinese authorities to prevent the spread of coronavirus from climbers ascending Nepal's side of the mountain.[240]\n\n\n\n### Routes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Overview South Col route and North Col/Ridge route\nMount Everest has two main climbing routes, the southeast ridge from Nepal and the north ridge from Tibet, as well as many other less frequently climbed routes.[241] Of the two main routes, the southeast ridge is technically easier and more frequently used. It was the route used by Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953 and the first recognised of 15 routes to the top by 1996.[241] This was, however, a route decision dictated more by politics than by design, as the Chinese border was closed to the western world in the 1950s, after the People's Republic of China invaded Tibet.[242]\n\n\nMost attempts are made during May, before the summer monsoon season. As the monsoon season approaches, the jet stream shifts northward, thereby reducing the average wind speeds high on the mountain.[243][244] While attempts are sometimes made in September and October, after the monsoons, when the jet stream is again temporarily pushed northward, the additional snow deposited by the monsoons and the less stable weather patterns at the monsoons' tail end makes climbing extremely difficult.\n\n\n\n#### Southeast ridge[edit]\n\n\nThe ascent via the southeast ridge begins with a trek to Base Camp at 5,380 m (17,700 ft) on the south side of Everest, in Nepal. Expeditions usually fly into Lukla (2,860 m) from Kathmandu and pass through Namche Bazaar. Climbers then hike to Base Camp, which usually takes six to eight days, allowing for proper altitude acclimatisation in order to prevent altitude sickness.[245] Climbing equipment and supplies are carried by yaks, dzopkyos (yak-cow hybrids), and human porters to Base Camp on the Khumbu Glacier. When Hillary and Tenzing climbed Everest in 1953, the British expedition they were part of (comprising over 400 climbers, porters, and Sherpas at that point) started from the Kathmandu Valley, as there were no roads further east at that time.\n\n\nClimbers spend a couple of weeks in Base Camp, acclimatising to the altitude. During that time, Sherpas and some expedition climbers set up ropes and ladders in the treacherous Khumbu Icefall.\n\n\nSeracs, crevasses, and shifting blocks of ice make the icefall one of the most dangerous sections of the route. Many climbers and Sherpas have been killed in this section. To reduce the hazard, climbers usually begin their ascent well before dawn, when the freezing temperatures glue ice blocks in place.\n\n\nAbove the icefall is Camp I at 6,065 metres (19,900 ft).\n\n\n\n![](image)Climber traversing Khumbu Icefall\nFrom Camp I, climbers make their way up the Western Cwm to the base of the Lhotse face, where Camp II or Advanced Base Camp (ABC) is established at 6,500 m (21,300 ft). The Western Cwm is a flat, gently rising glacial valley, marked by huge lateral crevasses in the centre, which prevent direct access to the upper reaches of the Cwm. Climbers are forced to cross on the far right, near the base of Nuptse, to a small passageway known as the \"Nuptse corner\". The Western Cwm is also called the \"Valley of Silence\" as the topography of the area generally cuts off wind from the climbing route. The high altitude and a clear, windless day can make the Western Cwm unbearably hot for climbers.[246]\n\n\nFrom Advanced Base Camp, climbers ascend the Lhotse face on fixed ropes, up to Camp III, located on a small ledge at 7,470 m (24,500 ft). From there, it is another 500 metres to Camp IV on the South Col at 7,920 m (26,000 ft).\n\n\nFrom Camp III to Camp IV, climbers are faced with two additional challenges: the Geneva Spur and the Yellow Band. The Geneva Spur is an anvil-shaped rib of black rock named by the 1952 Swiss expedition. Fixed ropes assist climbers in scrambling over this snow-covered rock band. The Yellow Band is a section of interlayered marble, phyllite, and semischist, which also requires about 100 metres of rope for traversing it.[246]\n\n\nOn the South Col, climbers enter the death zone. Climbers making summit bids typically can endure no more than two or three days at this altitude. If the weather is not clear with low winds during these short few days, climbers are forced to descend, many all the way back down to Base Camp.\n\n\nFrom Camp IV, climbers begin their summit push around midnight, with hopes of reaching the summit (still another 1,000 metres above) within 10 to 12 hours. Climbers first reach \"The Balcony\" at 8,400 m (27,600 ft), a small platform where they can rest and gaze at peaks to the south and east in the early light of dawn. Continuing up the ridge, climbers are then faced with a series of imposing rock steps which usually forces them to the east into the waist-deep snow, a serious avalanche hazard. At 8,750 m (28,700 ft), a small table-sized dome of ice and snow marks the South Summit.[246]\n\n\nFrom the South Summit, climbers follow the knife-edge southeast ridge along what is known as the \"Cornice traverse\", where snow clings to intermittent rock. This is the most exposed section of the climb, and a misstep to the left would send one 2,400 m (7,900 ft) down the southwest face, while to the immediate right is the 3,050 m (10,010 ft) Kangshung Face. At the end of this traverse is an imposing 12 m (39 ft) rock wall, the Hillary Step, at 8,790 m (28,840 ft).[247]\n\n\nHillary and Tenzing were the first climbers to ascend this step, and they did so using primitive ice climbing equipment and ropes. Nowadays, climbers ascend this step using fixed ropes previously set up by Sherpas. Once above the step, it is a comparatively easy climb to the top on moderately angled snow slopes—though the exposure on the ridge is extreme, especially while traversing large cornices of snow. With increasing numbers of people climbing the mountain in recent[*when?*] years, the Step has frequently become a bottleneck, with climbers forced to wait significant amounts of time for their turn on the ropes, leading to problems in getting climbers efficiently up and down the mountain.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAfter the Hillary Step, climbers also must traverse a loose and rocky section that has a large entanglement of fixed ropes that can be troublesome in bad weather. Climbers typically spend less than half an hour at the summit to allow time to descend to Camp IV before darkness sets in, to avoid serious problems with afternoon weather, or because supplemental oxygen tanks run out.\n\n\n\n#### North ridge route[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Three Steps\n\n![](image)Mount Everest north face from Rongbuk in Tibet\nThe north ridge route begins from the north side of Everest, in Tibet. Expeditions trek to the Rongbuk Glacier, setting up base camp at 5,180 m (16,990 ft) on a gravel plain just below the glacier. To reach Camp II, climbers ascend the medial moraine of the east Rongbuk Glacier up to the base of Changtse, at around 6,100 m (20,000 ft). Camp III (ABC – Advanced Base Camp) is situated below the North Col at 6,500 m (21,300 ft). To reach Camp IV on the North Col, climbers ascend the glacier to the foot of the col where fixed ropes are used to reach the North Col at 7,010 m (23,000 ft). From the North Col, climbers ascend the rocky north ridge to set up Camp V at around 7,775 m (25,500 ft). The route crosses the North Face in a diagonal climb to the base of the Yellow Band, reaching the site of Camp VI at 8,230 m (27,000 ft). From Camp VI, climbers make their final summit push.\n\n\nClimbers face a treacherous traverse from the base of the First Step: ascending from 8,501 to 8,534 m (27,890 to 28,000 ft), to the crux of the climb, the Second Step, ascending from 8,577 to 8,626 m (28,140 to 28,300 ft). (The Second Step includes a climbing aid called the \"Chinese ladder\", a metal ladder placed semi-permanently in 1975 by a party of Chinese climbers.[248] It has been almost continuously in place since, and ladders have been used by virtually all climbers on the route.) Once above the Second Step the inconsequential Third Step is clambered over, ascending from 8,690 to 8,800 m (28,510 to 28,870 ft). Once above these steps, the summit pyramid is climbed by a snow slope of 50 degrees, to the final summit ridge along which the top is reached.[249]\n\n\n\n### Summit[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A view from the summit of Mount Everest in May 2013\nThe summit of Everest has been described as \"the size of a dining room table\".[250] The summit is capped with snow over ice over rock, and the layer of snow varies from year to year.[251] The rock summit is made of Ordovician limestone and is a low-grade metamorphic rock.[252] (see the Surveys section for more on its height and about the Everest rock summit)\n\n\nBelow the summit, there is an area known as \"rainbow valley\", filled with dead bodies still wearing brightly coloured winter gear. Down to about 8,000 m (26,000 ft) is an area commonly called the \"death zone\", due to the high danger and low oxygen because of the low pressure.[83]\n\n\nBelow the summit the mountain slopes downward to the three main sides, or faces, of Mount Everest: the North Face, the South-West Face, and the East/Kangshung Face.[253][*better source needed*]\n\n\n\n### Death zone[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Effects of high altitude on humans\n\n![](image)The summit of Mount Everest from the North side\n![](image)From Kala Patthar, Nepal\nAt the higher regions of Mount Everest, climbers seeking the summit typically spend substantial time within the death zone (altitudes higher than 8,000 metres (26,000 ft)), and face significant challenges to survival. Temperatures can dip to very low levels, resulting in frostbite of any body part exposed to the air. Since temperatures are so low, snow is well-frozen in certain areas and death or injury by slipping and falling can occur. High winds at these altitudes on Everest are also a potential threat to climbers.\n\n\nAnother significant threat to climbers is low atmospheric pressure. The atmospheric pressure at the top of Everest is about a third of sea level pressure or 0.333 standard atmospheres (337 mbar), resulting in the availability of only about a third as much oxygen to breathe.[254]\n\n\nDebilitating effects of the death zone are so great that it takes most climbers up to 12 hours to walk the distance of 1.72 kilometres (1.07 mi) from South Col to the summit.[255] Achieving even this level of performance requires prolonged altitude acclimatisation, which takes 40–60 days for a typical expedition. A sea-level dweller exposed to the atmospheric conditions at the altitude above 8,500 m (27,900 ft) without acclimatisation would likely lose consciousness within 2 to 3 minutes.[256]\n\n\nIn May 2007, the Caudwell Xtreme Everest undertook a medical study of oxygen levels in human blood at extreme altitude. Over 200 volunteers climbed to Everest Base Camp where various medical tests were performed to examine blood oxygen levels. A small team also performed tests on the way to the summit.[257] Even at base camp, the low partial pressure of oxygen had direct effect on blood oxygen saturation levels. At sea level, blood oxygen saturation is generally 98 to 99 per cent. At base camp, blood saturation fell to between 85 and 87 per cent. Blood samples taken at the summit indicated very low oxygen levels in the blood. A side effect of low blood oxygen is a greatly increased breathing rate, often 80–90 breaths per minute as opposed to a more typical 20–30. Exhaustion can occur merely by attempting to breathe.[258]\n\n\nLack of oxygen, exhaustion, extreme cold, and climbing hazards all contribute to the death toll. An injured person who cannot walk is in serious trouble, since rescue by helicopter is generally impractical and carrying the person off the mountain is very risky. People who die during the climb are typically left behind. As of 2015, over 200 bodies remain on the mountain. It is not uncommon to find corpses near the standard climbing routes.[6]\n\n\n\n\n> Debilitating symptoms consistent with high altitude cerebral oedema commonly present during descent from the summit of Mount Everest. Profound fatigue and late times in reaching the summit are early features associated with subsequent death.\n> \n> — Mortality on Mount Everest, 1921–2006: descriptive study[259]\n> \n\n\nA 2008 study noted that the \"death zone\" is indeed where most Everest deaths occur, but also noted that most deaths occur during descent from the summit.[260] A 2014 article in *The Atlantic* about deaths on Everest noted that while falling is one of the greatest dangers the death zone presents for all 8000ers, avalanches are a more common cause of death at lower altitudes.[261] However, Everest climbing is more deadly than BASE jumping, although some have combined extreme sports and Everest, including a Russian who base-jumped off Everest in a wingsuit (though he did survive).[262]\n\n\nDespite this, Everest is safer for climbers than a number of peaks by some measurements, but it depends on the period.[263] Some examples are Kangchenjunga, K2, Annapurna, Nanga Parbat, and the Eiger (especially the *nordwand*).[263] Some factors that affect total mountain lethality include the level of popularity of the mountain, the skill of those climbing, and the difficulty of the climb.[264]\n\n\nAnother health hazard is retinal haemorrhages, which can damage eyesight and cause blindness.[265] Up to a quarter of Everest climbers can experience retinal haemorrhages, and although they usually heal within weeks of returning to lower altitudes, in 2010 a climber went blind and ended up dying in the death zone.[265]\n\n\n\n\n> At one o'clock in the afternoon, the British climber Peter Kinloch was on the roof of the world, in bright sunlight, taking photographs of the Himalayas below, \"elated, cheery and bubbly\". But Mount Everest is now his grave, because only minutes later, he suddenly went blind and had to be abandoned to die from the cold.\n> \n> — A. McSmith[265]\n> \n\n\nThe team made a huge effort for the next 12 hours to try to get him down the mountain, but to no avail, as they were unsuccessful in getting him through the difficult sections.[266] Even for the able, the Everest North-East ridge is recognised as a challenge. It is hard to rescue someone who has become incapacitated and it can be beyond the ability of rescuers to save *anyone* in such a difficult spot.[266] One way around this situation was pioneered by two Nepali men in 2011, who had intended to paraglide off the summit. They had no choice and were forced to go through with their plan anyway, because they had run out of bottled oxygen and supplies.[267] They successfully launched off the summit and para-glided down to Namche Bazaar in just 42 minutes, without having to climb down the mountain.[267]\n\n\n\n### Supplemental oxygen[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Climber at the summit wearing an oxygen mask\n![](image)Available oxygen at Everest\nMost expeditions use oxygen masks and tanks above 8,000 m (26,000 ft).[268] Everest can be climbed without supplementary oxygen, but only by the most accomplished mountaineers and at increased risk. Humans' ability to think clearly is hindered with low oxygen, and the combination of extreme weather, low temperatures, and steep slopes often requires quick, accurate decisions. While about 95 per cent of climbers who reach the summit use bottled oxygen in order to reach the top, about five per cent of climbers have summited Everest without supplemental oxygen. The death rate is double for those who attempt to reach the summit without supplemental oxygen.[269] Travelling above 2,400 m (8,000 ft) altitude is a factor in cerebral hypoxia.[270] One study found that Mount Everest may be the highest an acclimatised human could go, but also found that climbers may suffer permanent neurological damage despite returning to lower altitudes.[270]\n\n\nThe use of bottled oxygen to ascend Mount Everest has been controversial. It was first used on the 1922 British Mount Everest Expedition by George Finch and Geoffrey Bruce who climbed up to 7,800 m (25,600 ft) at a spectacular speed of 300 vertical metres (1,000 ft) per hour. Pinned down by a fierce storm, they escaped death by breathing oxygen from a jury-rigged set-up during the night. The next day they climbed to 8,100 m (26,600 ft) at 270 m/h (900 ft/h) – nearly three times as fast as non-oxygen users. Yet the use of oxygen was considered so unsportsmanlike that none of the rest of the Alpine world recognised this high ascent rate.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nGeorge Mallory described the use of such oxygen as unsportsmanlike, but he later concluded that it would be impossible for him to summit without it and consequently used it on his final attempt in 1924.[271] When Tenzing and Hillary made the first successful summit in 1953, they also used open-circuit bottled oxygen sets, with the expedition's physiologist Griffith Pugh referring to the oxygen debate as a \"futile controversy\", noting that oxygen \"greatly increases subjective appreciation of the surroundings, which after all is one of the chief reasons for climbing.\"[272] For the next twenty-five years, bottled oxygen was considered standard for any successful summit.\n\n\n\n\n> ...although an acclimatised lowlander can survive for a time on the summit of Everest without supplemental oxygen, one is so close to the limit that even a modicum of excess exertion may impair brain function.\n> \n> — Thomas F. Hornbein in *The high-altitude brain*[270]\n> \n\n\nReinhold Messner was the first climber to break the bottled oxygen tradition and in 1978, with Peter Habeler, made the first successful climb without it. In 1980, Messner summited the mountain solo, without supplemental oxygen or any porters or climbing partners, on the more difficult northwest route. Once the climbing community was satisfied that the mountain could be climbed without supplemental oxygen, many purists then took the next logical step of insisting that is how it *should* be climbed.[24]: 154\n\n\nThe aftermath of the 1996 disaster further intensified the debate. Jon Krakauer's *Into Thin Air* (1997) expressed the author's personal criticisms of the use of bottled oxygen. Krakauer wrote that the use of bottled oxygen allowed otherwise unqualified climbers to attempt to summit, leading to dangerous situations and more deaths. The disaster was partially caused by the sheer number of climbers (34 on that day) attempting to ascend, causing bottlenecks at the Hillary Step and delaying many climbers, most of whom summited after the usual 14:00 turnaround time. He proposed banning bottled oxygen except for emergency cases, arguing that this would both decrease the growing pollution on Everest—many bottles have accumulated on its slopes—and keep marginally qualified climbers off the mountain.\n\n\nThe 1996 disaster also introduced the issue of the guide's role in using bottled oxygen.[273]\n\n\nGuide Anatoli Boukreev's decision not to use bottled oxygen was sharply criticised by Jon Krakauer. Boukreev's supporters (who include G. Weston DeWalt, who co-wrote *The Climb*) state that using bottled oxygen gives a false sense of security.[274] Krakauer and his supporters point out that, without bottled oxygen, Boukreev could not directly help his clients descend.[275] They state that Boukreev said that he was going down with client Martin Adams,[275] but just below the south summit, Boukreev determined that Adams was doing fine on the descent and so descended at a faster pace, leaving Adams behind. Adams states in *The Climb*, \"For me, it was business as usual, Anatoli's going by, and I had no problems with that.\"[276]\n\n\nThe low oxygen can cause a mental fog-like impairment of cognitive abilities described as \"delayed and lethargic thought process, clinically defined as bradypsychia\" even after returning to lower altitudes.[277] In severe cases, climbers can experience hallucinations. Some studies have found that high-altitude climbers, including Everest climbers, experience altered brain structure.[277] The effects of high altitude on the brain, particularly if it can cause permanent brain damage, continue to be studied.[277]\n\n\n\n### Autumn climbing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Everest in September 2006\nAlthough generally less popular than spring, Mount Everest has also been climbed in the autumn (also called the \"post-monsoon season\").[66][278] For example, in 2010 Eric Larsen and five Nepali guides summited Everest in the autumn for the first time in ten years.[278] The autumn season, when the monsoon ends, is regarded as more dangerous because there is typically a lot of new snow which can be unstable.[279] However, this increased snow can make it more popular with certain winter sports like skiing and snowboarding.[66] Two Japanese climbers also summited in October 1973.[280]\n\n\nChris Chandler and Bob Cormack summited Everest in October 1976 as part of the American Bicentennial Everest Expedition that year, the first Americans to make an autumn ascent of Mount Everest according to the *Los Angeles Times*.[281] By the 21st century, summer and autumn can be more popular with skiing and snowboard attempts on Mount Everest.[282] During the 1980s, climbing in autumn was actually more popular than in spring.[283] U.S. astronaut Karl Gordon Henize died in October 1993 on an autumn expedition, conducting an experiment on radiation. The amount of background radiation increases with higher altitudes.[284]\n\n\nThe mountain has also been climbed in the winter, but that is not popular because of the combination of cold high winds and shorter days.[285] By January the peak is typically battered by 170 mph (270 km/h) winds and the average temperature of the summit is around −33 °F (−36 °C).[66]\n\n\n\n### Selected climbing records[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Timeline of climbing Mount Everest\n\n![](image)The Khumbu Icefall in 2005\n![](image)The Western Cwm (\"Coom\"), with Everest on the left and Lhotse to the right\nBy the end of the 2010 climbing season, there had been 5,104 ascents to the summit by about 3,142 individuals.[153] Some notable \"firsts\" by climbers include:\n\n\n\n* **1922**: First climb to 8,000 metres (26,247 ft), by George Finch and Captain Geoffrey Bruce\n* **1952**: First climb to South Col by 1952 Swiss Mount Everest expedition\n* **1953**: First ascent, by Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary on 1953 British Mount Everest expedition\n* **1960**: First reported ascent from the North Ridge by Wang Fuzhou, Gonpo and Qu Yinhua of China.[7]\n* **1975**: First female ascent, by Junko Tabei (16 May).[153][286]\n* **1975**: First female ascent from the North Ridge, by Phanthog, deputy head of the second Chinese Everest expedition that sent nine climbers to the summit (27 May).[287][288][289]\n* **1978**: First ascent without supplemental oxygen by Reinhold Messner and Peter Habeler[290]\n* **1978**: First solo ascent, by Franz Oppurg[291]\n* **1980**: First winter ascent, by Polish National Expedition Winter 1979/1980 (Leszek Cichy and Krzysztof Wielicki[292][293])\n* **1980**: Second solo ascent, and the first without supplemental oxygen, by Reinhold Messner[290]\n* **1981**: Third solo ascent, by Peter Hackett[294]\n* **1988**: First \"cross-over\" climb by Chinese, Japanese and Nepali teams which ascended the peak simultaneously from both the North and South sides of the mountain and descended down the other side.[286] The cross-over climb was also the first to be recorded on live broadcast television.\n* **1988**: First descent by paraglider, by Jean-Marc Boivin[295]\n* **1988**: First female ascent without supplemental oxygen by Lydia Bradey[296]\n* **1998**: Fastest to reach the summit via the southeast ridge (South Col), without supplemental oxygen, by Kazi Sherpa, in 20 hours and 24 minutes.[297][298][299]\n* **2000**: First descent by ski by Davo Karničar[300]\n* **2001**: First ascent by a blind climber, Erik Weihenmayer[301]\n* **2001**: Lhakpa Sherpa becomes first Nepali woman to summit Everest and survive.[302]\n* **2004**: Fastest to reach the summit via the southeast ridge (South Col), with supplemental oxygen, by Pemba Dorje, in 8 hours and 10 minutes.[303]\n* **2006**: Lhakpa Sherpa summits for the 6th time, breaking her own record for most successful female Everest climber.[304]\n* **2007**: Fastest to reach the summit via the northeast ridge, without supplemental oxygen, by Christian Stangl, in 16 hours, 42 minutes.[305][306]\n* **2010**: Youngest male to reach the summit, by Jordan Romero (13 years and 10 months old)[307]\n* **2011**: Most times to reach the summit, Apa Sherpa (21 times; 10 May 1990 – 11 May 2011)[308]\n* **2013**: Apa Sherpa tied for most times to reach the summit by Phurba Tashi (21 times; 1999–2013)\n* **2013**: Melissa Arnot, American, summits for the fifth time, breaking her own record for most successful summits by any non-Sherpa woman.[309]\n* **2014**: Youngest female to reach the summit, by Malavath Purna (13 years and 11 months old)\n* **2017**: Kami Rita Sherpa of Alpine Ascents reaches 21 ascents to the summit.[310][311]\n* **2019**: Kami Rita Sherpa reaches 24 ascents to the summit.[312]\n* **2021**: Kami Rita Sherpa reaches 25 ascents to the summit.[313][314]\n* **2022**: Kami Rita Sherpa reaches 26 ascents to the summit,[315] and Pasang Dawa Sherpa reaches 25 ascents to the summit.[316][317]\n* **2023**: Kami Rita Sherpa reaches 28 ascents to the summit.[318]\n\n\n### Summiting with disabilities[edit]\n\n\nSummiting Everest with disabilities such as amputations and diseases has become popular in the 21st century, with stories like that of Sudarshan Gautam, a man with no arms who made it to the top in 2013.[319] A teenager with Down's syndrome made it to Base camp, which has become a substitute for more extreme record-breaking because it carries many of the same thrills including the trip to the Himalayas and rustic scenery.[320] Danger lurks even at base camp though, which was the site where dozens were killed in the 2015 Mount Everest avalanches. Others that have climbed Everest with amputations include Mark Inglis (no legs), Hari Budha Magar (no legs), Paul Hockey (one arm only), and Arunima Sinha (one leg only).\n\n\nIn 2001, Erik Weihenmayer became the first person to reach the summit of Mount Everest while blind.[301]\n\n\n\n### Fake ascents[edit]\n\n\nIn 2021, Nepal banned three Indians for faking an ascent of Mount Everest in 2016.[321][322] In 2017, two Indian police officers, supposedly the first Indian couple to ascend Mount Everest, were sacked once it was found they had faked their ascent.[321]\n\n\n\n## Aviation[edit]\n\n\n### 1933: Flight over Everest[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Houston–Mount Everest flight expedition\n\nLucy, Lady Houston, a British millionaire former showgirl, funded the Houston Everest Flight of 1933. A formation of airplanes led by the Marquess of Clydesdale flew over the summit in an effort to photograph the unknown terrain.[323]\n\n\n\n### 1988: First climb and glide[edit]\n\n\nOn 26 September 1988, having climbed the mountain via the south-east ridge, Jean-Marc Boivin made the first paraglider descent of Everest,[295] in the process creating the record for the fastest descent of the mountain and the highest paraglider flight. Boivin said: \"I was tired when I reached the top because I had broken much of the trail, and to run at this altitude was quite hard.\"[324] Boivin ran 18 m (60 ft) from below the summit on 40-degree slopes to launch his paraglider, reaching Camp II at 5,900 m (19,400 ft) in 12 minutes (some sources say 11 minutes).[324][325] Boivin would not repeat this feat, as he was killed two years later in 1990, BASE-jumping off Venezuela's Angel Falls.[326]\n\n\n\n### 1991: Hot air balloon flyover[edit]\n\n\nIn 1991, four men in two balloons achieved the first hot-air balloon flight over Mount Everest.[327] In one balloon was Andy Elson and Eric Jones (cameraman), and in the other balloon Chris Dewhirst and Leo Dickinson (cameraman).[328] Dickinson went on to write a book about the adventure called *Ballooning Over Everest*.[328] The hot-air balloons were modified to function at up to 12,000 m (40,000 ft) altitude.[328] Reinhold Messner called one of Dickinson's panoramic views of Everest, captured on the now discontinued Kodak Kodachrome film, the \"best snap on Earth\", according to UK newspaper *The Telegraph*.[329] Dewhirst has offered to take passengers on a repeat of this feat for US$2.6 million per passenger.[327]\n\n\n\n### 2005: Pilot summits with helicopter[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Photo of a Eurocopter AS350 B3 \"Squirrel\"\nIn May 2005, pilot Didier Delsalle of France landed a Eurocopter AS350 B3 helicopter on the summit of Mount Everest.[330] He needed to land for two minutes to set the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI) official record, but he stayed for about four minutes, twice.[330] In this type of landing the rotors stay engaged, which avoids relying on the snow to fully support the aircraft. The flight set rotorcraft world records, for highest of both landing and take-off.[331]\n\n\nSome press reports suggested that the report of the summit landing was a misunderstanding of a South Col landing, but he had also landed on South Col two days earlier,[332] with this landing and the Everest records confirmed by the FAI.[331] Delsalle also rescued two Japanese climbers at 4,880 m (16,000 ft) while he was there. One climber noted that the new record meant a better chance of rescue.[330]\n\n\n\n### 2011: Paraglide off summit[edit]\n\n\nOn 21 May 2011, Nepalis Lakpa Tsheri Sherpa and Sano Bapu Sunuwar paraglided from Everest's summit to Namche Bazaar in 42 minutes.[267][333] After the flight they hiked, biked, and kayaked to the Indian Ocean, reaching the Bay of Bengal by 27 June 2011, thereby becoming the first persons to complete a continuous summit-to-sea descent from Everest.[334] They accomplished the ground-breaking feat despite Bapu having never previously climbed, and Lakpa having never kayaked and not even knowing how to swim.[334] The duo subsequently won National Geographic Adventurers of the Year for 2012 for their exploits.[334] In 2013 footage of the flight was shown on the television news program *Nightline*.[335]\n\n\n\n### 2014: Helicopter-assisted ascent[edit]\n\n\nIn 2014, a team financed and led by mountaineer Wang Jing used a helicopter to fly from South base camp to Camp 2 to avoid the Khumbu Icefall, and thence climbed to the Everest summit.[336] This climb immediately sparked outrage and controversy in much of the mountaineering world over the legitimacy and propriety of her climb.[168][337] Nepal ended up investigating Wang, who initially denied the claim that she had flown to Camp 2, admitting only that some support crew were flown to that higher camp, over the Khumbu Icefall.[338] In August 2014, however, she stated that she had flown to Camp 2 because the icefall was impassable. \"If you don't fly to Camp II, you just go home\", she said in an interview. In that same interview, she also insisted that she had never tried to hide this fact.[168]\n\n\nHer team had had to use the south side because the Chinese had denied them a permit to climb. Ultimately, the Chinese refusal may have been beneficial to Nepal's interests, allowing the government to showcase improved local hospitals and providing the opportunity for a new hybrid aviation/mountaineering style, triggering discussions about helicopter use in the mountaineering world.[168] National Geographic noted that a village festooned Wang with honours after she donated US$30,000 to the town's hospital. Wang won the International Mountaineer of the Year Award from the Nepal government in June 2014.[336]\n\n\n\n### 2016: Helicopter business increases[edit]\n\n\nIn 2016 the increased use of helicopters was noted for increased efficiency and for hauling material over the deadly Khumbu icefall.[339] In particular it was noted that flights saved icefall porters 80 trips but still increased commercial activity at Everest.[339] After many Nepalis died in the icefall in 2014, the government had wanted helicopters to handle more transportation to Camp 1 but this was not possible because of the 2015 earthquake closing the mountain, so this was then implemented in 2016 (helicopters did prove instrumental in rescuing many people in 2015 though).[339] That summer Bell tested the 412EPI, which conducted a series of tests including hovering at 5,500 m (18,000 ft) and flying as high as 6,100 m (20,000 ft) altitude near Mount Everest.[340]\n\n\n\n## Commercial climbing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Top down view showing the location of the summit, and its three main faces/sides\n![](image)Everest Base Camp\n![](image)Gorak Shep is about a three-hour walk to South EBC (Everest Base Camp).[341]\nAccording to Jon Krakauer, the era of commercialisation of Everest started in 1985, when the summit was reached by a guided expedition led by David Breashears that included Richard Bass, a wealthy 55-year-old businessman and an amateur mountain climber with only four years of climbing experience.[342] By the early-1990s, several companies were offering guided tours to the mountain. Rob Hall, one of the mountaineers who died in the 1996 disaster, had successfully guided 39 clients to the summit before that incident.[24]: 24, 42\n\n\nBy 2016, most guiding services cost between US$35,000 and US$200,000.[343] Going with a \"celebrity guide\", usually a well-known mountaineer typically with decades of climbing experience and perhaps several Everest summits, can cost over £100,000 as of 2015.[344] However, the services offered vary widely and it is \"buyer beware\" when doing deals in Nepal, one of the poorest and least developed countries in the world.[343][345] Tourism contributed 7.9 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019[346] in a country with high unemployment,[347] but Everest is special in that an Everest porter can make nearly double the nation's average wage in a region in which other sources of income are lacking.[348]\n\n\nCosts beyond the guiding service can vary widely. It is technically possible to reach the summit with minimal additional expenses, and there are \"budget\" travel agencies that offer logistical support for such trips. A limited support service, offering only some meals at base camp and bureaucratic overhead like a permit, can cost as little as US$7,000 as of 2007.[141] However, this is considered difficult and dangerous (as illustrated by the case of David Sharp).\n\n\nClimbing gear required to reach the summit may cost in excess of US$8,000, and most climbers also use bottled oxygen, which adds around US$3,000.[349] The permit to enter the Everest area from the south via Nepal costs US$10,000 to US$30,000 per person, depending on the size of the team.[349] The ascent typically starts at one of the two base camps near the mountain, both of which are approximately 100 kilometres (60 mi) from Kathmandu and 300 kilometres (190 mi) from Lhasa (the two nearest cities with major airports). Transferring one's equipment from the airport to the base camp may add as much as US$2,000.[349]\n\n\nMany climbers hire \"full service\" guide companies, which provide a wide spectrum of services, including the acquisition of permits, transportation to/from base camp, food, tents, fixed ropes,[350] medical assistance while on the mountain, an experienced mountaineer guide, and even personal porters to carry one's backpack and cook one's meals. The cost of such a guide service may range from US$40,000 to $80,000 per person.[351] Since most equipment is moved by Sherpas, clients of full-service guide companies can often keep their backpack weights under 10 kilograms (22 lb), or hire a Sherpa to carry their backpack for them. By contrast, climbers attempting less commercialised peaks, like Denali, are often expected to carry backpacks over 30 kilograms (66 lb) and, occasionally, to tow a sled with 35 kilograms (77 lb) of gear and food.[352]\n\n\nThe degree of commercialisation of Mount Everest is a frequent subject of criticism.[158] Jamling Tenzing Norgay, the son of Tenzing Norgay, said in a 2003 interview that his late father would have been shocked to discover that rich thrill-seekers with no climbing experience were now routinely reaching the summit, \"You still have to climb this mountain yourself with your feet. But the spirit of adventure is not there any more. It is lost. There are people going up there who have no idea how to put on crampons. They are climbing because they have paid someone $65,000. It is very selfish. It endangers the lives of others.\"[353]\n\n\nOne example of this is Shriya Shah-Klorfine, who had to be taught how to put on crampons during her summit attempt in 2012.[354] She paid at least US$40,000 to a new guiding company for the trip, and died when she ran out of oxygen during the descent after climbing for 27 hours straight.[355]\n\n\nReinhold Messner concurred in 2004, \"You could die in each climb and that meant you were responsible for yourself. We were real mountaineers: careful, aware and even afraid. By climbing mountains we were not learning how big we were. We were finding out how breakable, how weak and how full of fear we are. You can only get this if you expose yourself to high danger. I have always said that a mountain without danger is not a mountain....High altitude alpinism has become tourism and show. These commercial trips to Everest, they are still dangerous. But the guides and organisers tell clients, 'Don't worry, it's all organised.' The route is prepared by hundreds of Sherpas. Extra oxygen is available in all camps, right up to the summit. People will cook for you and lay out your beds. Clients feel safe and don't care about the risks.\"[356]\n\n\nBy 2015, Nepal was considering requiring that climbers have some experience, hoping this would both make the mountain safer and increase revenue.[357] One barrier to this is that low-budget firms make money *not* taking inexperienced climbers to the summit.[343] Those turned away by Western firms can often find another firm willing to take them for a price—that they return home soon after arriving after base camp, or part way up the mountain.[343] Whereas a Western firm will convince those they deem incapable to turn back, other firms simply give people the freedom to choose.[343]\n\n\nHowever, not all opinions on the subject among prominent mountaineers have been strictly negative. For example, Edmund Hillary stated in 2003 that while \"Having people pay $65,000 and then be led up the mountain by a couple of experienced guides...isn't really mountaineering at all\",[358] he was pleased by the changes brought to Everest area by Westerners, \"I don't have any regrets because I worked very hard indeed to improve the condition for the local people. When we first went in there they didn't have any schools, they didn't have any medical facilities, all over the years we have established 27 schools, we have two hospitals and a dozen medical clinics and then we've built bridges over wild mountain rivers and put in fresh water pipelines so in cooperation with the Sherpas we've done a lot to benefit them.\"[359]\n\n\nOne of the early guided summiters, Richard Bass (of Seven Summits fame) stated in 2003 that \"Climbers should have high altitude experience before they attempt the really big mountains. People don't realise the difference between a 20,000-foot [6,100 m] mountain and 29,000-foot [8,800 m]. It's not just arithmetic. The reduction of oxygen in the air is proportionate to the altitude alright, but the effect on the human body is disproportionate—an exponential curve. People climb Denali [6,190 m or 20,320 ft] or Aconcagua [6,960 m or 22,834 ft] and think, 'Heck, I feel great up here, I'm going to try Everest.' But it's not like that.\"[360]\n\n\n\n### Thefts and crime[edit]\n\n\nSome climbers have reported life-threatening thefts from supply caches. In May 2006, Vitor Negrete, the first Brazilian to climb Everest without oxygen and part of David Sharp's party, died during his descent, and theft of gear and food from his high-altitude camp may have contributed.[361][362]\n\n\n\"Several members were bullied, gear was stolen, and threats were made against me and my climbing partner, Michael Kodas, making an already stressful situation even more dire\", said one climber.[363]\n\n\nIn addition to theft, Michael Kodas describes in his book, *High Crimes: The Fate of Everest in an Age of Greed* (2008):[364] unethical guides and Sherpas, prostitution and gambling at the Tibet Base Camp, fraud related to the sale of oxygen bottles, and climbers collecting donations under the pretense of removing trash from the mountain.[365][366]\n\n\nThe Chinese side of Everest in Tibet was described as \"out of control\" in 2007 after one Canadian had all his gear stolen and was abandoned by his Sherpa.[367] Another Sherpa helped the victim get off the mountain safely and gave him some spare gear. Other climbers have also reported missing oxygen bottles, which can be worth hundreds of dollars each. Hundreds of climbers pass by people's tents, making it hard to safeguard against theft.[367] In the late 2010s, the reports of theft of oxygen bottles from camps became more common.[368]\n\n\n\n## 2014 Sherpa strike[edit]\n\n\nOn 18 April 2014, in one of the worst disasters to ever hit the Everest climbing community up to that time, 16 Sherpas died in Nepal due to the avalanche that swept them off Mount Everest. In response to the tragedy, numerous Sherpa climbing guides walked off the job and most climbing companies pulled out in respect for the Sherpa people mourning the loss.[369][370] Some still wanted to climb but there was too much controversy to continue that year.[369] One of the issues that triggered the work action by Sherpas was unreasonable client demands during climbs.[369]\n\n\n\n## Extreme sports at Mount Everest[edit]\n\n\nMount Everest has been host to other winter sports and adventuring besides mountaineering, including snowboarding, skiing, paragliding, and BASE jumping.\n\n\nYuichiro Miura became the first man to ski down Everest in the 1970s. He descended nearly 1,300 vertical metres (4,200 ft) from the South Col before falling with extreme injuries.[90] Stefan Gatt and Marco Siffredi snowboarded Mount Everest in 2001.[371] Other Everest skiers include Davo Karničar of Slovenia, who completed a top to south base camp descent in 2000, Hans Kammerlander of Italy in 1996 on the north side,[372] and Kit DesLauriers of the United States in 2006.[373] In 2006 Swede Tomas Olsson and Norwegian Tormod Granheim skied together down the north face. Olsson's anchor broke while they were rappelling down a cliff in the Norton couloir at about 8,500 metres, resulting in his death from a two and a half-kilometre fall. Granheim skied down to camp III.[374] Also, Marco Siffredi died in 2002 on his second snow-boarding expedition.[371]\n\n\nVarious types of gliding descents have slowly become more popular, and are noted for their rapid descents to lower camps. In 1986 Steve McKinney led an expedition to Mount Everest,[375] during which he became the first person to fly a hang-glider off the mountain.[325] Frenchman Jean-Marc Boivin made the first paraglider descent of Everest in September 1988, descending in minutes from the south-east ridge to a lower camp.[295] In 2011, two Nepalis made a gliding descent from the Everest summit down 5,000 metres (16,400 ft) in 45 minutes.[376] On 5 May 2013, the beverage company Red Bull sponsored Valery Rozov, who successfully BASE jumped off of the mountain while wearing a wingsuit, setting a record for world's highest BASE jump in the process.[262][377]\n\n\n\n## Everest and religion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Rongphu Monastery, with Mount Everest in the background\nThe southern part of Mount Everest is regarded as one of several \"hidden valleys\" of refuge designated by Padmasambhava, a ninth-century \"lotus-born\" Buddhist saint.[378]\n\n\nNear the base of the north side of Everest lies Rongbuk Monastery, which has been called the \"sacred threshold to Mount Everest, with the most dramatic views of the world.\"[379] For Sherpas living on the slopes of Everest in the Khumbu region of Nepal, Rongbuk Monastery is an important pilgrimage site, accessed in a few days of travel across the Himalayas through Nangpa La.[105]\n\n\nMiyolangsangma, a Tibetan Buddhist \"*Goddess of Inexhaustible Giving*\", is believed to have lived at the top of Mount Everest. According to Sherpa Buddhist monks, Mount Everest is Miyolangsangma's palace and playground, and all climbers are only partially welcome guests, having arrived without invitation.[378]\n\n\nThe Sherpa people also believe that Mount Everest and its flanks are blessed with spiritual energy, and one should show reverence when passing through this sacred landscape. Here, the karmic effects of one's actions are magnified, and impure thoughts are best avoided.[378]\n\n\n\n## Waste management[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Impacts of tourism § Mount Everest\n\nIn 2015, the president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association warned that pollution, especially human waste, has reached critical levels. As much as 12,000 kg (26,500 lb) of human excrement each season is left behind on the mountain.[380] Human waste is strewn across the verges of the route to the summit, making the four sleeping areas on the route up Everest's south side minefields of human excrement. Climbers above Base Camp—for the 62-year history of climbing on the mountain—have most commonly either buried their excrement in holes they dug by hand in the snow, or slung it into crevasses, or simply defecated wherever convenient, often within metres of their tents. The only place where climbers can defecate without worrying about contaminating the mountain is Base Camp. At approximately 5,500 m (18,000 ft), Base Camp sees the most activity of all camps on Everest because climbers acclimate and rest there. In the late-1990s, expeditions began using toilets that they fashioned from blue plastic 190-litre (50-US-gallon) barrels fitted with a toilet seat and enclosed.[381]\n\n\nThe problem of human waste is compounded by the presence of more anodyne waste: spent oxygen tanks, abandoned tents, empty cans and bottles. The Nepali government now requires each climber to pack out eight kilograms of waste when descending the mountain.[382]\n\n\nIn February 2019, due to the mounting waste problem, China closed the base camp on its side of Everest to visitors without climbing permits. Tourists are allowed to go as far as the Rongbuk Monastery.[383]\n\n\nIn April 2019, the Solukhumbu district's Khumbu Pasanglhamu Rural Municipality launched a campaign to collect nearly 10,000 kg of garbage from Everest.[384]\n\n\n\n## Context and maps[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n3D rendering of Mount Everest and surrounding terrain\n\nNearby peaks include Lhotse, 8,516 m (27,940 ft); Nuptse, 7,855 m (25,771 ft), and Changtse, 7,580 m (24,870 ft) among others. Another nearby peak is Khumbutse, and many of the highest mountains in the world are near Mount Everest. On the southwest side, a major feature in the lower areas is the Khumbu icefall and glacier, an obstacle to climbers on those routes but also to the base camps.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nSouthern and northern climbing routes as seen from the International Space Station.

For more details, see *1924 British Mount Everest expedition*.\n5. ^ ***a*** ***b*** The \"base\" of a mountain is a problematic notion in general with no universally accepted definition. However, for a peak rising out of relatively flat terrain, such as Mauna Kea or Denali, an \"approximate\" height above \"base\" can be calculated. Everest is more complicated since it only rises above relatively flat terrain on its north (Tibetan Plateau) side. Hence the concept of \"base\" has even less meaning for Everest than for Mauna Kea or Denali, and the range of numbers for \"height above base\" is wider. In general, comparisons based on \"height above base\" are somewhat suspect.\n6. **^** In the table below, the temperature given is the average lowest temperature recorded in that month. So, in an average year, the lowest recorded July temperature will be -18 degrees Celsius, and the lowest recorded January temperature will be -36 degrees Celsius.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** *Geography of Nepal: Physical, Economic, Cultural and Regional* by Netra Bahadur Thapa, D.P.

In the foreground are Thamserku, Kangtega, and Ama Dablam.\n**Mount Everest** (Nepali: सगरमाथा, romanized: *Sagarmāthā*; Tibetan: *Chomolungma* ཇོ་མོ་གླང་མ; Chinese: 珠穆朗玛峰; pinyin: *Zhūmùlǎngmǎ Fēng*) is Earth's highest mountain above sea level, located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas. The China–Nepal border runs across its summit point.[2] Its elevation (snow height) of 8,848.86 m (29,031 ft 8+1⁄2 in) was most recently established in 2020 by the Chinese and Nepali authorities.[3][4]\n\n\nMount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal (known as the \"standard route\") and the other from the north in Tibet. While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route, Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness, weather, and wind, as well as hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall. As of November 2022, 310 people have died on Everest. Over 200 bodies remain on the mountain and have not been removed due to the dangerous conditions.[5][6]\n\n\nThe first recorded efforts to reach Everest's summit were made by British mountaineers. As Nepal did not allow foreigners to enter the country at the time, the British made several attempts on the north ridge route from the Tibetan side. After the first reconnaissance expedition by the British in 1921 reached 7,000 m (22,970 ft) on the North Col, the 1922 expedition pushed the north ridge route up to 8,320 m (27,300 ft), marking the first time a human had climbed above 8,000 m (26,247 ft). The 1924 expedition resulted in one of the greatest mysteries on Everest to this day: George Mallory and Andrew Irvine made a final summit attempt on 8 June but never returned, sparking debate as to whether they were the first to reach the top. Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary made the first documented ascent of Everest in 1953, using the southeast ridge route. Norgay had reached 8,595 m (28,199 ft) the previous year as a member of the 1952 Swiss expedition. The Chinese mountaineering team of Wang Fuzhou, Gonpo, and Qu Yinhua made the first reported ascent of the peak from the north ridge on 25 May 1960.[7]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The name \"Mount Everest\" was first proposed in this 1856 speech, later published in 1857, in which the mountain was first confirmed as the world's highest.\nThe Tibetan name for Everest is *Qomolangma* (ཇོ་མོ་གླང་མ, lit. \"Holy Mother\"). The name was first recorded with a Chinese transcription on the 1721 Kangxi Atlas during the reign of Emperor Kangxi of Qing China, and then appeared as *Tchoumour Lancma* on a 1733 map published in Paris by the French geographer D'Anville based on the former map.[8] The Tibetan name is also popularly romanised as *Chomolungma* and (in Wylie) as *Jo-mo-glang-ma*.[13]\n\n\nThe official Chinese transcription is 珠穆朗玛峰 (t 珠穆朗瑪峰), whose pinyin form is *Zhūmùlǎngmǎ Fēng*. While other Chinese names were used, including *Shèngmǔ Fēng* (t 聖母峰, s 圣母峰, lit. \"Holy Mother Peak\"), these names were largely phased out when the Ministry of Internal Affairs of China issued a decree to adopt a sole name in May 1952.[14]\n\n\nOther documented local names include \"Deodungha\" (\"Holy Mountain\"), but it is unclear whether it is commonly used.[15]\n\n\nIn 1849, the British survey wanted to preserve local names if possible (e.g., Kangchenjunga and Dhaulagiri), and Andrew Waugh, the British Surveyor General of India, argued that he could not find any commonly used local name, as his search for a local name was hampered by Nepal's and Tibet's exclusion of foreigners. Waugh argued that because there were many local names, it would be difficult to favour one name over all others; he decided that Peak XV should be named after British surveyor Sir George Everest, his predecessor as Surveyor General of India.[16][17][18] Everest himself opposed the name suggested by Waugh and told the Royal Geographical Society in 1857 that \"Everest\" could not be written in Hindi nor pronounced by \"the native of India\". Waugh's proposed name prevailed despite the objections, and in 1865, the Royal Geographical Society officially adopted Mount Everest as the name for the highest mountain in the world.[16][19] The modern pronunciation of Everest (/ˈɛvərɪst/)[20] is different from Sir George's pronunciation of his surname (/ˈiːvrɪst/ *EEV-rist*).[21][*verification needed*] In the late 19th century, many European cartographers incorrectly believed that a native name for the mountain was Gaurishankar, a mountain between Kathmandu and Everest.[22]\n\n\nIn the early 1960s, the Nepali government coined the Nepali name *Sagarmāthā* (IAST transcription) or *Sagar-Matha*[23] (सगर-माथा, [sʌɡʌrmatʰa], lit. \"goddess of the sky\"[24]),[25] which means \"the Head in the Great Blue Sky\", being derived from सगर (sagar), meaning \"sky\", and माथा (māthā), meaning \"head\".\n\n\n\n### Other names[edit]\n\n\n![](image)1890 graphic with the Himalayas, including Gaurisankar (Mount Everest) in the distance\n* Peak XV (British Empire's Survey)[16][17][18]\n* Old Darjeeling name: \"Deodungha\"[26]\n* \"Gauri Shankar\" or \"Gaurisankar\"; in modern times the name is used for a different peak about 30 miles (48 kilometres) away, but it was used occasionally until about 1900.[27]\n\n\n## Surveys[edit]\n\n\n### 19th-century surveys[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mount Everest relief map\nIn 1802, the British began the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India to fix the locations, heights, and names of the world's highest mountains. Starting in southern India, the survey teams moved northward using giant theodolites, each weighing 500 kg (1,100 lb) and requiring 12 men to carry, to measure heights as accurately as possible. They reached the Himalayan foothills by the 1830s, but Nepal was unwilling to allow the British to enter the country due to suspicions of their intentions. Several requests by the surveyors to enter Nepal were denied.[16]\n\n\nThe British were forced to continue their observations from Terai, a region south of Nepal which is parallel to the Himalayas. Conditions in Terai were difficult because of torrential rains and malaria. Three survey officers died from malaria while two others had to retire because of failing health.[16]\n\n\nNonetheless, in 1847, the British continued the survey and began detailed observations of the Himalayan peaks from observation stations up to 240 km (150 mi) distant. Weather restricted work to the last three months of the year. In November 1847, Andrew Scott Waugh, the British Surveyor General of India, made several observations from the Sawajpore station at the east end of the Himalayas. Kangchenjunga was then considered the highest peak in the world, and with interest, he noted a peak beyond it, about 230 km (140 mi) away. John Armstrong, one of Waugh's subordinates, also saw the peak from a site farther west and called it peak \"b\". Waugh would later write that the observations indicated that peak \"b\" was higher than Kangchenjunga, but given the great distance of the observations, closer observations were required for verification. The following year, Waugh sent a survey official back to Terai to make closer observations of peak \"b\", but clouds thwarted his attempts.[16]\n\n\nIn 1849, Waugh dispatched James Nicolson to the area, who made two observations from Jirol, 190 km (120 mi) away. Nicolson then took the largest theodolite and headed east, obtaining over 30 observations from five different locations, with the closest being 174 km (108 mi) from the peak.[16]\n\n\nNicolson retreated to Patna on the Ganges to perform the necessary calculations based on his observations. His raw data gave an average height of 9,200 m (30,200 ft) for peak \"b\", but this did not consider light refraction, which distorts heights. However, the number clearly indicated that peak \"b\" was higher than Kangchenjunga. Nicolson contracted malaria and was forced to return home without finishing his calculations. Michael Hennessy, one of Waugh's assistants, had begun designating peaks based on Roman numerals, with Kangchenjunga named Peak IX. Peak \"b\" now became known as Peak XV.[16]\n\n\nIn 1852, stationed at the survey headquarters in Dehradun, Radhanath Sikdar, an Indian mathematician and surveyor from Bengal was the first to identify Everest as the world's highest peak, using trigonometric calculations based on Nicolson's measurements.[28] An official announcement that Peak XV was the highest was delayed for several years as the calculations were repeatedly verified. Waugh began work on Nicolson's data in 1854, and along with his staff spent almost two years working on the numbers, having to deal with the problems of light refraction, barometric pressure, and temperature over the vast distances of the observations. Finally, in March 1856 he announced his findings in a letter to his deputy in Calcutta. Kangchenjunga was declared to be 8,582 m (28,156 ft), while Peak XV was given the height of 8,840 m (29,002 ft). Waugh concluded that Peak XV was \"most probably the highest in the world\".[16] Peak XV (measured in feet) was calculated to be exactly 29,000 ft (8,839.2 m) high, but was publicly declared to be 29,002 ft (8,839.8 m) in order to avoid the impression that an exact height of 29,000 feet (8,839.2 m) was nothing more than a rounded estimate.[29] Waugh is sometimes playfully credited with being \"the first person to put two feet on top of Mount Everest\".[30]\n\n\n\n### 20th-century surveys[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Published by the Survey of Nepal, this is Map 50 of the 57 map set at 1:50,000 scale \"attached to the main text on the First Joint Inspection Survey, 1979–80, Nepal-China border.\" At the top centre, a boundary line, identified as separating \"China\" and \"Nepal\", passes through the summit contour. The boundary here and for much of the China–Nepal border follows the main Himalayan watershed divide.\n![](image)Kangshung Face (the east face) as seen from orbit\nIn 1856, Andrew Waugh announced Everest (then known as Peak XV) as 8,840 m (29,002 ft) high, after several years of calculations based on observations made by the Great Trigonometrical Survey.[31] \nFrom 1952 to 1954, the Survey of India, using triangulation methods, determined that the height of Everest was 8,847.73 m (29,028 ft).[32] In 1975 it was subsequently reaffirmed by a Chinese measurement of 8,848.13 m (29,029.30 ft).[33] In both cases the snow cap, not the rock head, was measured.\nThe 8,848 m (29,029 ft) height given was officially recognised by Nepal and China.[34] Nepal planned a new survey in 2019 to determine if the April 2015 Nepal earthquake affected the height of the mountain.[35]\n\n\nIn May 1999, an American Everest expedition directed by Bradford Washburn anchored a GPS unit into the highest bedrock. A rock head elevation of 8,850 m (29,035 ft), and a snow/ice elevation 1 m (3 ft) higher, were obtained via this device.[36] Although as of 2001, it has not been officially recognised by Nepal,[37] this figure is widely quoted. Geoid uncertainty casts doubt upon the accuracy claimed by both the 1999 and 2005 (see § 21st-century surveys) surveys.[38]\n\n\nIn 1955, a detailed photogrammetric map (at a scale of 1:50,000) of the Khumbu region, including the south side of Mount Everest, was made by Erwin Schneider as part of the 1955 International Himalayan Expedition, which also attempted Lhotse.\n\n\nIn the late 1980s, an even more detailed topographic map of the Everest area was made under the direction of Bradford Washburn, using extensive aerial photography.[39]\n\n\n\n### 21st-century surveys[edit]\n\n\nOn 9 October 2005, after several months of measurement and calculation, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping announced the height of Everest as 8,844.43 m (29,017.16 ft) with accuracy of ±0.21 m (8.3 in), claiming it was the most accurate and precise measurement to date.[40] This height is based on the highest point of rock and not the snow and ice covering it. The Chinese team measured a snow-ice depth of 3.5 m (11 ft),[33] which is in agreement with a net elevation of 8,848 m (29,029 ft). An argument arose between China and Nepal as to whether the official height should be the rock height (8,844 m, China) or the snow height (8,848 m, Nepal). In 2010, both sides agreed that the height of Everest is 8,848 m, and Nepal recognises China's claim that the rock height of Everest is 8,844 m.[41] On 8 December 2020, it was jointly announced by the two countries that the new official height is 8,848.86 metres (29,031.7 ft).[42][43]\n\n\nIt is thought that the plate tectonics of the area are adding to the height and moving the summit northeastwards. Two accounts suggest the rates of change are 4 mm (0.16 in) per year vertically and 3 to 6 mm (0.12 to 0.24 in) per year horizontally,[36][44] but another account mentions more lateral movement (27 mm or 1.1 in),[45] and even shrinkage has been suggested.[46]\n\n\n\n### Comparisons[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of highest mountains on Earth.\n\nThe summit of Everest is the point at which Earth's surface reaches the greatest distance above sea level. Several other mountains are sometimes claimed to be the \"tallest mountains on Earth\". Mauna Kea in Hawaii is tallest when measured from its base;[note 5] it rises over 10,200 m (33,464.6 ft) when measured from its base on the mid-ocean floor, but only attains 4,205 m (13,796 ft) above sea level.\n\n\nBy the same measure of base to summit, Denali, in Alaska, formerly known as Mount McKinley, is taller than Everest as well.[note 5] Despite its height above sea level of only 6,190 m (20,308 ft), Denali sits atop a sloping plain with elevations from 300 to 900 m (980 to 2,950 ft), yielding a height above base in the range of 5,300 to 5,900 m (17,400 to 19,400 ft); a commonly quoted figure is 5,600 m (18,400 ft).[47][48] By comparison, reasonable base elevations for Everest range from 4,200 m (13,800 ft) on the south side to 5,200 m (17,100 ft) on the Tibetan Plateau, yielding a height above base in the range of 3,650 to 4,650 m (11,980 to 15,260 ft).[39]\n\n\nThe summit of Chimborazo in Ecuador is 2,168 m (7,113 ft) farther from Earth's centre (6,384.4 km, 3,967.1 mi) than that of Everest (6,382.3 km, 3,965.8 mi), because the Earth bulges at the equator.[49] This is despite Chimborazo having a peak 6,268 m (20,564.3 ft) above sea level versus Mount Everest's 8,848 m (29,028.9 ft).\n\n\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mount Everest with snow melted, showing upper geologic layers in bands\nGeologists have subdivided the rocks comprising Mount Everest into three units called formations.[50][51] Each formation is separated from the other by low-angle faults, called detachments, along which they have been thrust southward over each other. From the summit of Mount Everest to its base these rock units are the Qomolangma Formation, the North Col Formation, and the Rongbuk Formation.\n\n\nThe Qomolangma Formation, also known as the Jolmo Lungama Formation,[52] runs from the summit to the top of the Yellow Band, about 8,600 m (28,200 ft) above sea level. It consists of greyish to dark grey or white, parallel laminated and bedded, Ordovician limestone interlayered with subordinate beds of recrystallised dolomite with argillaceous laminae and siltstone. Gansser first reported finding microscopic fragments of crinoids in this limestone.[53][54] Later petrographic analysis of samples of the limestone from near the summit revealed them to be composed of carbonate pellets and finely fragmented remains of trilobites, crinoids, and ostracods. Other samples were so badly sheared and recrystallised that their original constituents could not be determined. A thick, white-weathering thrombolite bed that is 60 m (200 ft) thick comprises the foot of the \"Third Step\", and base of the summit pyramid of Everest. This bed, which crops out starting about 70 m (230 ft) below the summit of Mount Everest, consists of sediments trapped, bound, and cemented by the biofilms of micro-organisms, especially cyanobacteria, in shallow marine waters. The Qomolangma Formation is broken up by several high-angle faults that terminate at the low angle normal fault, the Qomolangma Detachment. This detachment separates it from the underlying Yellow Band. The lower five metres of the Qomolangma Formation overlying this detachment are very highly deformed.[50][51][55]\n\n\nThe bulk of Mount Everest, between 7,000 and 8,600 m (23,000 and 28,200 ft), consists of the North Col Formation, of which the Yellow Band forms the upper part between 8,200 to 8,600 m (26,900 to 28,200 ft). The Yellow Band consists of intercalated beds of Middle Cambrian diopside-epidote-bearing marble, which weathers a distinctive yellowish brown, and muscovite-biotite phyllite and semischist. Petrographic analysis of marble collected from about 8,300 m (27,200 ft) found it to consist as much as five per cent of the ghosts of recrystallised crinoid ossicles. The upper five metres of the Yellow Band lying adjacent to the Qomolangma Detachment is badly deformed. A 5–40 cm (2.0–15.7 in) thick fault breccia separates it from the overlying Qomolangma Formation.[50][51][55]\n\n\nThe remainder of the North Col Formation, exposed between 7,000 to 8,200 m (23,000 to 26,900 ft) on Mount Everest, consists of interlayered and deformed schist, phyllite, and minor marble. Between 7,600 and 8,200 m (24,900 and 26,900 ft), the North Col Formation consists chiefly of biotite-quartz phyllite and chlorite-biotite phyllite intercalated with minor amounts of biotite-sericite-quartz schist. Between 7,000 and 7,600 m (23,000 and 24,900 ft), the lower part of the North Col Formation consists of biotite-quartz schist intercalated with epidote-quartz schist, biotite-calcite-quartz schist, and thin layers of quartzose marble. These metamorphic rocks appear to be the result of the metamorphism of Middle to Early Cambrian deep sea flysch composed of interbedded, mudstone, shale, clayey sandstone, calcareous sandstone, graywacke, and sandy limestone. The base of the North Col Formation is a regional low-angle normal fault called the \"Lhotse detachment\".[50][51][55]\n\n\nBelow 7,000 m (23,000 ft), the Rongbuk Formation underlies the North Col Formation and forms the base of Mount Everest. It consists of sillimanite-K-feldspar grade schist and gneiss intruded by numerous sills and dikes of leucogranite ranging in thickness from 1 cm to 1,500 m (0.4 in to 4,900 ft).[51][56] These leucogranites are part of a belt of Late Oligocene–Miocene intrusive rocks known as the Higher Himalayan leucogranite. They formed as the result of partial melting of Paleoproterozoic to Ordovician high-grade metasedimentary rocks of the Higher Himalayan Sequence about 20 to 24 million years ago during the subduction of the Indian Plate.[57]\n\n\nMount Everest consists of sedimentary and metamorphic rocks that have been faulted southward over continental crust composed of Archean granulites of the Indian Plate during the Cenozoic collision of India with Asia.[58][59][60] Current interpretations argue that the Qomolangma and North Col formations consist of marine sediments that accumulated within the continental shelf of the northern passive continental margin of India before it collided with Asia. The Cenozoic collision of India with Asia subsequently deformed and metamorphosed these strata as it thrust them southward and upward.[61][62] The Rongbuk Formation consists of a sequence of high-grade metamorphic and granitic rocks that were derived from the alteration of high-grade metasedimentary rocks. During the collision of India with Asia, these rocks were thrust downward and to the north as they were overridden by other strata; heated, metamorphosed, and partially melted at depths of over 15 to 20 kilometres (9.3 to 12.4 mi) below sea level; and then forced upward to surface by thrusting towards the south between two major detachments.[63] The Himalayas are rising by about 5 mm per year.\n\n\n\n### IUGS geological heritage site[edit]\n\n\nIn respect of the recognition of the \"highest rocks on the planet\" as fossiliferous, marine limestone, the Ordovician Rocks of Mount Everest were included by the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) in its assemblage of 100 geological heritage sites around the world in a listing published in October 2022. The organisation defines an IUGS Geological Heritage Site as \"a key place with geological elements and/or processes of international scientific relevance, used as a reference, and/or with a substantial contribution to the development of geological sciences through history.\"[64]\n\n\n\n## Flora and fauna[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A yak at around 4,790 m (15,720 ft)\nThere is very little native flora or fauna on Everest. A type of moss grows at 6,480 metres (21,260 ft) on Mount Everest and it may be the highest altitude plant species.[65] An alpine cushion plant called *Arenaria* is known to grow below 5,500 metres (18,000 ft) in the region.[66] According to the study based on satellite data from 1993 to 2018, vegetation is expanding in the Everest region. Researchers have found plants in areas that were previously deemed bare.[67]\n\n\nA minute black jumping spider of the genus *Euophrys* has been found at elevations as high as 6,700 metres (22,000 ft),[68] possibly making it the highest confirmed non-microscopic permanent resident on Earth. Another Euophrys species, *E. everestensis*, has been found at 5,030 metres (16,500 ft), and may feed on insects that have been blown there by the wind.[68] There is a high likelihood of microscopic life at even higher altitudes.\n\n\nThe bar-headed goose migrates over the Himalayas and have been seen flying at the higher altitudes of the mountain.[69] In 1953, George Lowe (part of the expedition of Tenzing and Hillary) said that he saw bar-headed geese flying over Everest's summit.[70] Another bird species, the chough, have been spotted as high as the South Col at 7,920 metres (25,980 ft)[71] and yellow-billed choughs have been seen as high as 7,900 metres (26,000 ft).[69]\n\n\nYaks are often used to haul gear for Mount Everest climbs. They can haul around 100 kg (220 pounds), have thick fur and large lungs.[66] Other animals in the region include the Himalayan tahr, which is sometimes the prey of the snow leopard.[72] The Himalayan black bear can be found up to about 4,300 metres (14,000 ft) and the red panda is also present in the region.[73] One expedition found a surprising range of species in the region including a pika and ten new species of ants.[74]\n\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\nMount Everest has an ice cap climate (Köppen *EF*) with all months averaging well below freezing.[note 6]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Mount Everest\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Mean minimum °C (°F)\n | −36(−33)\n | −35(−31)\n | −32(−26)\n | −31(−24)\n | −25(−13)\n | −20(−4)\n | −18(0)\n | −18(0)\n | −21(−6)\n | −27(−17)\n | −30(−22)\n | −34(−29)\n | −36(−33)\n |\n| Source: [75] |\n\n### Climate change[edit]\n\n\nThe base camp for Everest expeditions based out of Nepal is located by Khumbu Glacier, which is rapidly thinning and destabilizing due to climate change, making it unsafe for climbers. As recommended by the committee formed by Nepal's government to facilitate and monitor mountaineering in the Everest region, Taranath Adhikari—the director general of Nepal's tourism department—said they have plans to move the base camp to a lower altitude. This would mean a longer distance for climbers between the base camp and Camp 1. However, the present base camp is still useful and could still serve its purpose for three to four years. The move may happen by 2024, per officials.[76]\n\n\n\n### Meteorology[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Atmospheric pressure comparison\n | Pressure\n | Reference\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| kilopascal | psi |\n| Olympus Mons summit\n | 0.03\n | 0.0044\n | –\n |\n| Mars average\n | 0.6\n | 0.087\n | –\n |\n| Hellas Planitia bottom\n | 1.16\n | 0.168\n | –\n |\n| Armstrong limit | 6.25\n | 0.906\n | –\n |\n| Mount Everest summit\n | 33.7\n | 4.89\n | [77] |\n| Earth sea level | 101.3\n | 14.69\n | –\n |\n| Dead Sea level\n | 106.7\n | 15.48\n | [78] |\n| Surface of Venus | 9,200\n | 1,330\n | [79] |\n\n\nIn 2008, a new weather station at about 8,000 m (26,000 ft) elevation went online.[80] The station's first data in May 2008 were air temperature −17 °C (1 °F), relative humidity 41.3 per cent, atmospheric pressure 382.1 hPa (38.21 kPa), wind direction 262.8°, wind speed 12.8 m/s (28.6 mph, 46.1 km/h), global solar radiation 711.9 watts/m2, solar UVA radiation 30.4 W/m2.[80] The project was orchestrated by Stations at High Altitude for Research on the Environment (SHARE), which also placed the Mount Everest webcam in 2011.[80][81] The solar-powered weather station is on the South Col.[82]\n\n\nMount Everest extends into the upper troposphere and penetrates the stratosphere.[83] The air pressure at the summit is generally about one-third what it is at sea level. The altitude can expose the summit to the fast and freezing winds of the jet stream.[84] Winds commonly attain 160 km/h (100 mph);[85] in February 2004, a wind speed of 280 km/h (175 mph) was recorded at the summit.\n\n\nThese winds can hamper or endanger climbers, by blowing them into chasms[85] or (by Bernoulli's principle) by lowering the air pressure further, reducing available oxygen by up to 14 per cent.[84][86] To avoid the harshest winds, climbers typically aim for a 7- to 10-day window in the spring and fall when the Asian monsoon season is starting up or ending.\n\n\n\n## Expeditions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **appears to be slanted towards recent events.** Please try to keep recent events in historical perspective and add more content related to non-recent events. *(July 2022)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*\n |\n\n\n![](image)Climbers below the Geneva Spur\n![](image)Reunion of the 1953 British team\nSee also: List of people who died climbing Mount Everest\n\nBecause Mount Everest is the highest mountain in the world, it has attracted considerable attention and climbing attempts. Whether the mountain was climbed in ancient times is unknown. It may have been climbed in 1924, although this has never been confirmed, as neither of the men making the attempt returned. Several climbing routes have been established over several decades of climbing expeditions to the mountain.[87][88][*better source needed*]\n\n\n\n### Overview[edit]\n\n\nEverest's summit is first known to have been reached by a human in 1953, and interest from climbers increased thereafter.[89] Despite the effort and attention poured into expeditions, only about 200 people had summited by 1987.[89] Everest remained a difficult climb for decades, even for serious attempts by professional climbers and large national expeditions, which were the norm until the commercial era began in the 1990s.[90]\n\n\nBy March 2012, Everest had been climbed 5,656 times with 223 deaths.[91] Although lower mountains have longer or steeper climbs, Everest is so high the jet stream can hit it. Climbers can be faced with winds beyond 320 km/h (200 mph) when the weather shifts.[92] At certain times of the year the jet stream shifts north, providing periods of relative calm at the mountain.[93] Other dangers include blizzards and avalanches.[93]\n\n\nBy 2013, The Himalayan Database recorded 6,871 summits by 4,042 different people.[94]\n\n\n\n### Early attempts[edit]\n\n\nIn 1885, Clinton Thomas Dent, president of the Alpine Club, suggested that climbing Mount Everest was possible in his book *Above the Snow Line*.[95]\n\n\nThe northern approach to the mountain was discovered by George Mallory and Guy Bullock on the initial 1921 British Reconnaissance Expedition. It was an exploratory expedition not equipped for a serious attempt to climb the mountain. With Mallory leading (and thus becoming the first European to set foot on Everest's flanks) they climbed the North Col to an altitude of 7,005 metres (22,982 ft). From there, Mallory espied a route to the top, but the party was unprepared to climb any further and descended.\n\n\nThe British returned for a 1922 expedition. George Finch climbed using oxygen for the first time. He ascended at a remarkable speed—290 metres (951 ft) per hour—and reached an altitude of 8,320 m (27,300 ft), the first time a human reported to climb higher than 8,000 m. Mallory and Col. Felix Norton made a second unsuccessful attempt.\n\n\nThe next expedition was in 1924. The initial attempt by Mallory and Geoffrey Bruce was aborted when weather conditions prevented the establishment of Camp VI. The next attempt was that of Norton and Somervell, who climbed without oxygen and in perfect weather, traversing the North Face into the Great Couloir. Norton managed to reach 8,550 m (28,050 ft), though he ascended only 30 m (98 ft) or so in the last hour. Mallory rustled up oxygen equipment for a last-ditch effort. He chose young Andrew Irvine as his partner.[96]\n\n\n\n![](image)1952 documentary\nOn 8 June 1924, George Mallory and Andrew Irvine made an attempt on the summit via the North Col-North Ridge-Northeast Ridge route from which they never returned. On 1 May 1999, the Mallory and Irvine Research Expedition found Mallory's body on the North Face in a snow basin below and to the west of the traditional site of Camp VI. Controversy has raged in the mountaineering community whether one or both of them reached the summit 29 years before the confirmed ascent and safe descent of Everest by Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953.\n\n\nIn 1933, Lady Houston, a British millionairess, funded the Houston Everest Flight of 1933, which saw a formation of two aeroplanes led by the Marquess of Clydesdale fly over the Everest summit.[97][98][99][100]\n\n\nEarly expeditions—such as Charles Bruce's in the 1920s and Hugh Ruttledge's two unsuccessful attempts in 1933 and 1936—tried to ascend the mountain from Tibet, via the North Face. Access was closed from the north to Western expeditions in 1950 after China took control of Tibet. In 1950, Bill Tilman and a small party which included Charles Houston, Oscar Houston, and Betsy Cowles undertook an exploratory expedition to Everest through Nepal along the route which has now become the standard approach to Everest from the south.[101]\n\n\nThe 1952 Swiss Mount Everest Expedition, led by Edouard Wyss-Dunant, was granted permission to attempt a climb from Nepal. It established a route through the Khumbu icefall and ascended to the South Col at an elevation of 7,986 m (26,201 ft). Raymond Lambert and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay were able to reach an elevation of about 8,595 m (28,199 ft) on the southeast ridge, setting a new climbing altitude record. Tenzing's experience was useful when he was hired to be part of the British expedition in 1953.[102] The Swiss decided to make another post-monsoon attempt in the autumn; they made it to the South Col but were driven back by winter winds and severe cold.[103][104]\n\n\n\n### First successful ascent by Tenzing and Hillary, 1953[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1953 British Mount Everest expedition\n\n![](image)Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay\nIn 1953, a ninth British expedition, led by John Hunt, returned to Nepal. Hunt selected two climbing pairs to attempt to reach the summit. The first pair, Tom Bourdillon and Charles Evans, came within 100 m (330 ft) of the summit on 26 May 1953, but turned back after running into oxygen problems. As planned, their work in route finding and breaking trail and their oxygen caches were of great aid to the following pair. Two days later, the expedition made its second assault on the summit with the second climbing pair: the New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay, a Nepali Sherpa climber. They reached the summit at 11:30 am local time on 29 May 1953 via the South Col route. At the time, both acknowledged it as a team effort by the whole expedition, but Tenzing revealed a few years later that Hillary had put his foot on the summit first.[105] They paused at the summit to take photographs and buried a few sweets and a small cross in the snow before descending.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nNews of the expedition's success reached London on the morning of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation, 2 June. A few days later, the Queen gave orders that Hunt (a Briton) and Hillary (a New Zealander) were to be knighted in the Order of the British Empire for the ascent.[106] Tenzing, a Nepali Sherpa who was a citizen of India, was granted the George Medal by the UK. Hunt was ultimately made a life peer in Britain, while Hillary became a founding member of the Order of New Zealand.[107] Hillary and Tenzing have also been recognised in Nepal. In 2009, statues were raised in their honour, and in 2014, Hillary Peak and Tenzing Peak were named for them.[108][109]\n\n\n\n### 1950s–1960s[edit]\n\n\nOn 23 May 1956, Ernst Schmied and Juerg Marmet ascended.[110] This was followed by Dölf Reist and Hans-Rudolf von Gunten on 24 May 1957.[110] Wang Fuzhou, Gonpo and Qu Yinhua of China made the first reported ascent of the peak from the North Ridge on 25 May 1960.[7] The first American to climb Everest, Jim Whittaker, joined by Nawang Gombu, reached the summit on 1 May 1963.[111][112]\n\n\n\n### 1970s[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 1970 Mount Everest disaster\n\nIn 1970, Japanese mountaineers conducted a major expedition. The centrepiece was a large \"siege\"-style expedition led by Saburo Matsukata, working on finding a new route up the southwest face.[113] Another element of the expedition was an attempt to ski Mount Everest.[90] Despite a staff of over one hundred people and a decade of planning work, the expedition suffered eight deaths and failed to summit via the planned routes.[90] However, Japanese expeditions did enjoy some successes. For example, Yuichiro Miura became the first man to ski down Everest from the South Col—he descended nearly 1,300 vertical metres (4,200 ft) from the South Col before falling with extreme injuries. Another success was an expedition that put four on the summit via the South Col route.[90][114][115] Miura's exploits became the subject of film, and he went on to become the oldest person to summit Mount Everest in 2003 at age 70 and again in 2013 at the age of 80.[116]\n\n\n\nIn 1975, Junko Tabei, a Japanese woman, became the first woman to summit Mount Everest.[90]\n\n\nThe 1975 British Mount Everest Southwest Face expedition led and organised by Chris Bonington made the first ascent of the south west face of Everest from the western cwm. \n\n\nThe 1976 British and Nepalese Army Expedition to Everest led by Tony Streather put Bronco Lane and Brummy Stokes on the summit by the normal route.\n\n\nIn 1978, Reinhold Messner and Peter Habeler made the first ascent of Everest without supplemental oxygen.\n\n\n\n### 1979/1980: Winter Himalaism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Confirmation of the summit obtained by Nepal's Ministry of Tourism\nThe Polish climber Andrzej Zawada headed the first winter ascent of Mount Everest, the first winter ascent of an eight-thousander. The team of 20 Polish climbers and 4 Sherpas established a base camp on Khumbu Glacier in early January 1980. On 15 January, the team managed to set up Camp III at 7150 metres above sea level, but further action was stopped by hurricane-force winds. The weather improved after 11 February, when Leszek Cichy, Walenty Fiut and Krzysztof Wielicki set up camp IV on South Col (7906 m). Cichy and Wielicki started the final ascent at 6:50 am on 17 February. At 2:40 pm Andrzej Zawada at base camp heard the climbers' voices over the radio – \"We are on the summit! The strong wind blows all the time. It is unimaginably cold.\"[117][118][119][120] The successful winter ascent of Mount Everest started a new decade of Winter Himalaism, which became a Polish specialisation. After 1980 Poles did ten first winter ascents on 8000 metre peaks, which earned Polish climbers a reputation of \"Ice Warriors\".[121][118][122][123]\n\n\n\n### Lho La tragedy, 1989[edit]\n\n\nIn May 1989, Polish climbers under the leadership of Eugeniusz Chrobak organised an international expedition to Mount Everest on a difficult western ridge. Ten Poles and nine foreigners participated, but ultimately only the Poles remained in the attempt for the summit. On 24 May, Chrobak and Andrzej Marciniak, starting from camp V at 8,200 m, overcame the ridge and reached the summit. But on 27 May, during an avalanche from the side of Khumbutse near the Lho La pass, four Polish climbers were killed: Mirosław Dąsal, Mirosław Gardzielewski, Zygmunt Andrzej Heinrich and Wacław Otręba. The following day, due to his injuries, Chrobak also died. Marciniak, who was also injured, was saved by a rescue expedition in which Artur Hajzer and New Zealanders Gary Ball and Rob Hall took part. In the organisation of the rescue expedition they took part, inter alia Reinhold Messner, Elizabeth Hawley, Carlos Carsolio and the US consul.[124]\n\n\n\n### 1996 disaster[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1996 Mount Everest disaster\n\nOn 10 and 11 May 1996, eight climbers died after several guided expeditions were caught in a blizzard high up on the mountain during a summit attempt on 10 May. During the 1996 season, 15 people died while climbing on Mount Everest. These were the highest death tolls for a single weather event, and for a single season, until the sixteen deaths in the 2014 Mount Everest avalanche. The guiding disaster gained wide publicity and raised questions about the commercialisation of climbing and the safety of guiding clients on Mount Everest.\n\n\nJournalist Jon Krakauer, on assignment from *Outside* magazine, was in one of the affected guided parties, and afterward published the bestseller *Into Thin Air*, which related his experience. Krakauer was critical of guide Anatoli Boukreev in his recollection of the expedition.[125][126] A year later, Boukreev co-authored *The Climb*, in part as a rebuttal of Krakauer's portrayal.[127] The dispute sparked a debate within the climbing community. Boukreev was later awarded The American Alpine Club's David Sowles Award for his rescue efforts on the expedition.[126]\n\n\nIn May 2004, physicist Kent Moore and surgeon John L. Semple, both researchers from the University of Toronto, told *New Scientist* magazine that an analysis of weather conditions on 11 May suggested that weather caused oxygen levels to plunge about 14 per cent.[128][129]\n\n\nOne of the survivors was Beck Weathers, an American client of New Zealand–based guide service Adventure Consultants. Weathers was left for dead about 275 metres (900 feet) from Camp 4 at 7,950 metres (26,085 feet). After spending a night on the mountain, Weathers managed to make it back to Camp 4 with massive frostbite and vision impaired due to snow blindness.[130] When he arrived at Camp 4, fellow climbers considered his condition terminal and left him in a tent to die overnight.[131]\n\n\nWeathers' condition had not improved and an immediate descent to a lower elevation was deemed essential.[131] A helicopter rescue was out of the question: Camp 4 was higher than the rated ceiling of any available helicopter. Weathers was lowered to Camp 2. Eventually, a helicopter rescue was organised thanks to the Nepali Army.[130][131]\n\n\nThe storm's impact on climbers on the North Ridge of Everest, where several climbers also died, was detailed in a first-hand account by British filmmaker and writer Matt Dickinson in his book *The Other Side of Everest*. Sixteen-year-old Mark Pfetzer was on the climb and wrote about it in his account, *Within Reach: My Everest Story*.\n\n\nThe 2015 feature film *Everest*, directed by Baltasar Kormákur, is based on the events of this guiding disaster.[132]\n\n\n\n### 2006 mountaineering season[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2006 fatalities\n |\n| --- |\n| Deaths[133] | Nation[134] |\n| Tuk Bahadur Thapa Masa\n | ![](image)   Nepal |\n| Igor Plyushkin\n | ![](image) Russia |\n| Vitor Negrete | ![](image) Brazil |\n| David Sharp | ![](image) United Kingdom |\n| Thomas Weber\n | ![](image) Germany |\n| Tomas Olsson | ![](image) Sweden |\n| Jacques-Hugues Letrange\n | ![](image) France |\n| Ang Phinjo\n | ![](image)   Nepal |\n| \\*Pavel Kalny | ![](image) Czech Republic |\n| Lhakpa Tseri[135] | ![](image)   Nepal |\n| Dawa Temba[135] | ![](image)   Nepal |\n| Sri Kishan[134] | ![](image) India |\n| *\\*Lhotse face fatality* |\n\n\n![](image)Small avalanche on Everest, 2006\nIn 2006, 12 people died. One death in particular (see below) triggered an international debate and years of discussion about climbing ethics.[136] The season was also remembered for the rescue of Lincoln Hall who had been left by his climbing team and declared dead, but was later discovered alive and survived being helped off the mountain.\n\n\n\n#### David Sharp ethics controversy, 2006[edit]\n\n\nThere was an international controversy about the death of a solo British climber David Sharp, who attempted to climb Mount Everest in 2006 but died in his attempt. The story broke out of the mountaineering community into popular media, with a series of interviews, allegations, and critiques. The question was whether climbers that season had left a man to die and whether he could have been saved. He was said to have attempted to summit Mount Everest by himself with no Sherpa or guide and fewer oxygen bottles than considered normal.[137] He went with a low-budget Nepali guide firm that only provides support up to Base Camp, after which climbers go as a \"loose group\", offering a high degree of independence. The manager at Sharp's guide support said Sharp did not take enough oxygen for his summit attempt and did not have a Sherpa guide.[138] It is less clear who knew Sharp was in trouble, and if they did know, whether they were qualified or capable of helping him.[137]\n\n\nDouble-amputee climber Mark Inglis said in an interview with the press on 23 May 2006, that his climbing party, and many others, had passed Sharp, on 15 May, sheltering under a rock overhang 450 metres (1,480 ft) below the summit, without attempting a rescue.[139] Inglis said 40 people had passed by Sharp, but he might have been overlooked as climbers assumed Sharp was the corpse nicknamed \"Green Boots\",[140] but Inglis was not aware that Turkish climbers had tried to help Sharp despite being in the process of helping an injured woman down (a Turkish woman, Burçak Poçan). There has also been some discussion about Himex in the commentary on Inglis and Sharp. In regards to Inglis's initial comments, he later revised certain details because he had been interviewed while he was \"...physically and mentally exhausted, and in a lot of pain. He had suffered severe frostbite – he later had five fingertips amputated.\" When they went through Sharp's possessions they found a receipt for US$7,490, believed to be the whole financial cost.[141] Comparatively, most expeditions are between $35,000 to US$100,000 plus an additional $20,000 in other expenses that range from gear to bonuses.[142] It was estimated on 14 May that Sharp summited Mount Everest and began his descent down, but 15 May he was in trouble but being passed by climbers on their way up and down.[143] On 15 May 2006 it is believed he was suffering from hypoxia and was about 300 m (1,000 ft) from the summit on the North Side route.[143]\n\n\n\n\n> Dawa from Arun Treks also gave oxygen to David and tried to help him move, repeatedly, for perhaps an hour. But he could not get David to stand alone or even stand to rest on his shoulders, and crying, Dawa had to leave him too. Even with two Sherpas, it was not going to be possible to get David down the tricky sections below.\n> \n> — Jamie McGuiness[144]\n> \n\n\nBeck Weathers of the 1996 Mount Everest disaster said that those who are dying are often left behind and that he himself had been left for dead twice but was able to keep walking.[145] *The Tribune* of Chandigarh, India quoted someone who described what happened to Sharp as \"the most shameful act in the history of mountaineering\".[146] In addition to Sharp's death, at least nine other climbers perished that year, including multiple Sherpas working for various guiding companies.[147]\n\n\n\n\n> You are never on your own. There are climbers everywhere.\n> \n> — David Sharp[148]\n> \n\n\nMuch of this controversy was captured by the *Discovery Channel* while filming the television program *Everest: Beyond the Limit*. A crucial decision affecting the fate of Sharp is shown in the program, where an early returning climber, Lebanese adventurer Maxim Chaya, is descending from the summit and radios to his base camp manager (Russell Brice) that he has found a frostbitten and unconscious climber in distress. Chaya is unable to identify Sharp, who had chosen to climb solo without any support and so did not identify himself to other climbers. The base camp manager assumes that Sharp is part of a group that has already calculated that they must abandon him, and informs his lone climber that there is no chance of him being able to help Sharp by himself. As Sharp's condition deteriorates through the day and other descending climbers pass him, his opportunities for rescue diminish: his legs and feet curl from frostbite, preventing him from walking; the later descending climbers are lower on oxygen and lack the strength to offer aid; time runs out for any Sherpas to return and rescue him.\n\n\nDavid Sharp's body remained just below the summit on the Chinese side next to \"Green Boots\"; they shared a space in a small rock cave that was an ad hoc tomb for them.[143] Sharp's body was removed from the cave in 2007, according to the BBC,[149] and since 2014, Green Boots has been missing, presumably removed or buried.[6]\n\n\n\n#### Lincoln Hall rescue, 2006[edit]\n\n\nAs the Sharp debate kicked off on 26 May 2006, Australian climber Lincoln Hall was found alive after being left for dead the day before.[150] He was found by a party of four climbers (Dan Mazur, Andrew Brash, Myles Osborne and Jangbu Sherpa) who, giving up their own summit attempt, stayed with Hall and descended with him and a party of 11 Sherpas sent up to carry him down. Hall later fully recovered. His team assumed he had died from cerebral edema, and they were instructed to cover him with rocks.[150] There were no rocks around to do this and he was abandoned.[151] The erroneous information of his death was passed on to his family. The next day he was discovered alive by another party.[151]\n\n\n\n\n> I was shocked to see a guy without gloves, hat, oxygen bottles or sleeping bag at sunrise at 28,200 feet [8,600 m] height, just sitting up there.\n> \n> — Dan Mazur[151]\n> \n\n\nLincoln greeted his fellow mountaineers with this:[151]\n\n\n\n\n> I imagine you are surprised to see me here.\n> \n> — Lincoln Hall[151]\n> \n\n\nLincoln Hall went on to live for several more years, often giving talks about his near-death experience and rescue, before dying from unrelated medical issues in 2012 at the age of 56 (born in 1955).[151]\n\n\n\n### 2007[edit]\n\n\nOn 21 May 2007, Canadian climber Meagan McGrath initiated the successful high-altitude rescue of Nepali Usha Bista. Recognising this rescue, Major McGrath was selected as a 2011 recipient of the Sir Edmund Hillary Foundation of Canada Humanitarian Award, which recognises a Canadian who has personally or administratively contributed a significant service or act in the Himalayan Region of Nepal.[152]\n\n\n\n### Ascent statistics up to 2010 season[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ascents of Mount Everest by year through 2010\n![](image)The sun rising on Everest in 2011\nBy the end of the 2010 climbing season, there had been 5,104 ascents to the summit by about 3,142 individuals, with 77 per cent of these ascents being accomplished since 2000.[153] The summit was achieved in 7 of the 22 years from 1953 to 1974 and was not missed between 1975 and 2014.[153] In 2007, the record number of 633 ascents was recorded, by 350 climbers and 253 sherpas.[153]\n\n\nAn illustration of the explosion of popularity of Everest is provided by the numbers of daily ascents. Analysis of the 1996 Mount Everest disaster shows that part of the blame was on the bottleneck caused by a large number of climbers (33 to 36) attempting to summit on the same day; this was considered unusually high at the time. By comparison, on 23 May 2010, the summit of Mount Everest was reached by 169 climbers – more summits in a single day than in the cumulative 31 years from the first successful summit in 1953 through 1983.[153]\n\n\nThere have been 219 fatalities recorded on Mount Everest from the 1922 British Mount Everest Expedition through the end of 2010, a rate of 4.3 fatalities for every 100 summits (this is a general rate, and includes fatalities amongst support climbers, those who turned back before the peak, those who died en route to the peak and those who died while descending from the peak). Of the 219 fatalities, 58 (26.5 per cent) were climbers who had summited but did not complete their descent.[153] Though the rate of fatalities has decreased since the year 2000 (1.4 fatalities for every 100 summits, with 3938 summits since 2000), the significant increase in the total number of climbers still means 54 fatalities since 2000: 33 on the northeast ridge, 17 on the southeast ridge, 2 on the southwest face, and 2 on the north face.[153]\n\n\nNearly all attempts at the summit are done using one of the two main routes. The traffic seen by each route varies from year to year. In 2005–07, more than half of all climbers elected to use the more challenging, but cheaper northeast route. In 2008, the northeast route was closed by the Chinese government for the entire climbing season, and the only people able to reach the summit from the north that year were athletes responsible for carrying the Olympic torch for the 2008 Summer Olympics.[154] The route was closed to foreigners once again in 2009 in the run-up to the 50th anniversary of the Dalai Lama's exile.[155] These closures led to declining interest in the north route, and, in 2010, two-thirds of the climbers reached the summit from the south.[153]\n\n\n\n### 2010s[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Mount Everest in 2012 and Mount Everest in 2013\n\n![](image)Selfie on the summit, 2012\nThe 2010s were a time of new highs and lows for the mountain, with back-to-back disasters in 2013 and 2014 causing record deaths. In 2015 there were no summits for the first time in decades. However, other years set records for numbers of summits – 2013's record number of summiters, around 667, was surpassed in 2018 with around 800 summiting the peak,[156] and a subsequent record was set in 2019 with over 890 summiters.[157]\n\n\n\n\n\nYears in review summary\n| Year\n | Summiters\n | References\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2010\n | 543\n | [157] |\n| 2011\n | 538\n | [157] |\n| 2012 | 547\n | [158] |\n| 2013 | 658–670\n | [159][157] |\n| 2014\n | 106\n | [160] |\n| 2015\n | 0\n | [161][157] |\n| 2016 | 641\n | [162] |\n| 2017 | 648\n | [163] |\n| 2018 | 807\n | [156][164] |\n| 2019\n | approx. 891\n | [157] |\n\n\n\n### 2014 avalanche and season[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 Mount Everest avalanche\n\n![](image)Mount Everest, 2014\nOn 18 April 2014, an avalanche hit the area just below Base Camp 2 at around 01:00 UTC (06:30 local time) and at an elevation of about 5,900 metres (19,400 ft).[165] Sixteen people were killed in the avalanche (all Nepali guides) and nine more were injured.[166]\n\n\nDuring the season, a 13-year-old girl, Malavath Purna, reached the summit, becoming the youngest female climber to do so.[167] Additionally, one team used a helicopter to fly from South base camp to Camp 2 to avoid the Khumbu Icefall, then reached the Everest summit. This team had to use the south side because the Chinese had denied them a permit to climb. A team member (Jing Wang) donated US$30,000 to a local hospital.[168] She was named the Nepali \"International Mountaineer of the Year\".[168]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![](image)The location of the fatal ice avalanche on the 2014 route, and the revised 2015 route through the Khumbu\n\nOver 100 people summited Everest from China (Tibet region), and six from Nepal in the 2014 season.[169] This included 72-year-old Bill Burke, the Indian teenage girl, and a Chinese woman Jing Wang.[170] Another teen girl summiter was Ming Kipa Sherpa who summited with her elder sister Lhakpa Sherpa in 2003, and who had achieved the most times for woman to the summit of Mount Everest at that time.[171] (see also Santosh Yadav)\n\n\n\n### 2015 avalanche, earthquake, season[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2015 Mount Everest avalanches\n\n![](image)Everest, April 2015\n2015 was set to be a record-breaking season of climbs, with hundreds of permits issued in Nepal and many additional permits in Tibet (China). However, on 25 April 2015, an earthquake measuring 7.8 Mw triggered an avalanche that hit Everest Base Camp,[172] effectively shutting down the Everest climbing season.[173] 18 bodies were recovered from Mount Everest by the Indian Army mountaineering team.[174] The avalanche began on Pumori,[175] moved through the Khumbu Icefall on the southwest side of Mount Everest, and slammed into the South Base Camp.[176] 2015 was the first time since 1974 with no spring summits, as all climbing teams pulled out after the quakes and avalanche.[177][178] One of the reasons for this was the high probability of aftershocks (over 50 per cent according to the United States Geological Survey).[179] Just weeks after the first quake, the region was rattled again by a 7.3 magnitude quake and there were also many considerable aftershocks.[180]\n\n\nThe quakes trapped hundreds of climbers above the Khumbu icefall, and they had to be evacuated by helicopter as they ran low on supplies.[181] The quake shifted the route through the ice fall, making it essentially impassable to climbers.[181] Bad weather also made helicopter evacuation difficult.[181] The Everest tragedy was small compared to the impact overall on Nepal, with almost nine thousand dead[182][183] and about 22,000 injured.[182] In Tibet, by 28 April at least 25 had died, and 117 were injured.[184] By 29 April 2015, the Tibet Mountaineering Association (North/Chinese side) closed Everest and other peaks to climbing, stranding 25 teams and about 300 people on the north side of Everest.[185] On the south side, helicopters evacuated 180 people trapped at Camps 1 and 2.[186]\n\n\n\n#### Mountain re-opens in August 2015[edit]\n\n\nOn 24 August 2015, Nepal re-opened Everest to tourism including mountain climbers.[187] The only climber permit for the autumn season was awarded to Japanese climber Nobukazu Kuriki, who had tried four times previously to summit Everest without success. He made his fifth attempt in October, but had to give up just 700 m (2,300 ft) from the summit due to \"strong winds and deep snow\".[188][189] Kuriki noted the dangers of climbing Everest, having himself survived being stuck in a freezing snow hole for two days near the top, which came at the cost of all his fingertips and his thumb, lost to frostbite, which added further difficulty to his climb.[190]\n\n\nSome sections of the trail from Lukla to Everest Base Camp (Nepal) were damaged in the earthquakes earlier in the year and needed repairs to handle trekkers.[191]\n\n\n\n### 2016 season[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mount Everest in 2016\n\nHawley's database records 641 made it to the summit in early 2016.[192]\n\n\n\n### 2017 season[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mount Everest in 2017\n\n2017 was the biggest season yet, permit-wise, yielding hundreds of summiters and a handful of deaths.[193] On 27 May 2017, Kami Rita made his 21st climb to the summit with the Alpine Ascents Everest Expedition, one of three people in the World along with Apa Sherpa and Phurba Tashi Sherpa to make it to the summit of Mount Everest 21 times.[194][195] The season had a tragic start with the death of Ueli Steck of Switzerland, who died from a fall during a warm-up climb.[196] There was a continued discussion about the nature of possible changes to the Hillary Step.[197] Total summiters for 2017 was tallied up to be 648.[163] 449 summited via Nepal (from the South) and 120 from Chinese Tibet (North side).[198]\n\n\n\n### 2018[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mount Everest in 2018\n\n![](image)Mount Everest in the upper left (March 2018)\n807 climbers summited Mount Everest in 2018,[199] including 563 on the Nepal side and 240 from the Chinese Tibet side.[156] This broke the previous record for total summits in year from which was 667 in 2013, and one factor that aided in this was an especially long and clear weather window of 11 days during the critical spring climbing season.[156][200][164] Various records were broken, including a summit by double-amputee Xia Boyu, who undertook his climb after winning a court case in the Nepali Supreme Court.[156] There were no major disasters, but seven climbers died in various situations including several sherpas as well as international climbers.[156] Although record numbers of climbers reached the summit, old-time summiters that made expeditions in the 1980s lamented the crowding, feces, and cost.[200]\n\n\nHimalayan record keeper Elizabeth Hawley died in late January 2018.[201]\n\n\nFigures for the number of permits issued by Nepal range from 347[202] to 375.[203]\n\n\n\n### 2019[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2019 fatalities[204] |\n| --- |\n| Fatalities | Nationality\n |\n| Chris Daly\n | ![](image) United States |\n| Donald Cash\n | ![](image) United States |\n| Robin Fisher\n | ![](image) United Kingdom |\n| Druba Bista\n | ![](image)   Nepal |\n| Kevin Hynes\n | ![](image) Ireland |\n| Kalpana Dash\n | ![](image) India |\n| Anjali S.

Everest from the North side during April–May 2020, becoming the only climbers to summit the world's highest peak during the pandemic, at least through May. The team was there to re-measure the height of Mount Everest.[225]\n\n\nOn 12 May 2022, the first all-Black team summited Mt. Everest. Seven men and two women climbers from the U.S. and Kenya, guided by eight sherpas, comprised the expedition.[226]\n\n\n\n### 2023[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sunset view of Everest\nOn 18 May the second deaf person, Malaysian national Muhammad Hawari Hashim reached the top of Mount Everest.

He faced, among other penalties, a $22,000 fine and a possible four years in jail. In the end, he was allowed to return home but banned from mountaineering in Nepal for 10 years.[231]\n\n\nThe number of permits issued each year by Nepal is:[230][232]\n\n\n\n* 2008: 160\n* 2009: 220\n* 2010: 209\n* 2011: 225\n* 2012: 208\n* 2013: 316\n* 2014: 326 (extended for use through 2019)\n* 2015: 356 (extended for use through 2017)\n* 2016: 289\n* 2017: 366 to 373\n* 2018: 346\n* 2019: 381\n* 2020: 0 (no permits issued during the pandemic)\n* 2021: 408 (current record)[233][234]\n\n\nThe Chinese side in Tibet is also managed with permits for summiting Everest.[235] They did not issue permits in 2008, due to the Olympic torch relay being taken to the summit of Mount Everest.[236]\n\n\nIn March 2020, the governments of China and Nepal cancelled all climbing permits for Mount Everest due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[237][238] In April 2020, a group of Chinese mountaineers began an expedition from the Chinese side. The mountain remained closed on the Chinese side to all foreign climbers.[239] On 10 May 2021, a separation line was announced by Chinese authorities to prevent the spread of coronavirus from climbers ascending Nepal's side of the mountain.[240]\n\n\n\n### Routes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Overview South Col route and North Col/Ridge route\nMount Everest has two main climbing routes, the southeast ridge from Nepal and the north ridge from Tibet, as well as many other less frequently climbed routes.[241] Of the two main routes, the southeast ridge is technically easier and more frequently used. It was the route used by Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953 and the first recognised of 15 routes to the top by 1996.[241] This was, however, a route decision dictated more by politics than by design, as the Chinese border was closed to the western world in the 1950s, after the People's Republic of China invaded Tibet.[242]\n\n\nMost attempts are made during May, before the summer monsoon season. As the monsoon season approaches, the jet stream shifts northward, thereby reducing the average wind speeds high on the mountain.[243][244] While attempts are sometimes made in September and October, after the monsoons, when the jet stream is again temporarily pushed northward, the additional snow deposited by the monsoons and the less stable weather patterns at the monsoons' tail end makes climbing extremely difficult.\n\n\n\n#### Southeast ridge[edit]\n\n\nThe ascent via the southeast ridge begins with a trek to Base Camp at 5,380 m (17,700 ft) on the south side of Everest, in Nepal. Expeditions usually fly into Lukla (2,860 m) from Kathmandu and pass through Namche Bazaar. Climbers then hike to Base Camp, which usually takes six to eight days, allowing for proper altitude acclimatisation in order to prevent altitude sickness.[245] Climbing equipment and supplies are carried by yaks, dzopkyos (yak-cow hybrids), and human porters to Base Camp on the Khumbu Glacier. When Hillary and Tenzing climbed Everest in 1953, the British expedition they were part of (comprising over 400 climbers, porters, and Sherpas at that point) started from the Kathmandu Valley, as there were no roads further east at that time.\n\n\nClimbers spend a couple of weeks in Base Camp, acclimatising to the altitude. During that time, Sherpas and some expedition climbers set up ropes and ladders in the treacherous Khumbu Icefall.\n\n\nSeracs, crevasses, and shifting blocks of ice make the icefall one of the most dangerous sections of the route. Many climbers and Sherpas have been killed in this section. To reduce the hazard, climbers usually begin their ascent well before dawn, when the freezing temperatures glue ice blocks in place.\n\n\nAbove the icefall is Camp I at 6,065 metres (19,900 ft).\n\n\n\n![](image)Climber traversing Khumbu Icefall\nFrom Camp I, climbers make their way up the Western Cwm to the base of the Lhotse face, where Camp II or Advanced Base Camp (ABC) is established at 6,500 m (21,300 ft). The Western Cwm is a flat, gently rising glacial valley, marked by huge lateral crevasses in the centre, which prevent direct access to the upper reaches of the Cwm. Climbers are forced to cross on the far right, near the base of Nuptse, to a small passageway known as the \"Nuptse corner\". The Western Cwm is also called the \"Valley of Silence\" as the topography of the area generally cuts off wind from the climbing route. The high altitude and a clear, windless day can make the Western Cwm unbearably hot for climbers.[246]\n\n\nFrom Advanced Base Camp, climbers ascend the Lhotse face on fixed ropes, up to Camp III, located on a small ledge at 7,470 m (24,500 ft). From there, it is another 500 metres to Camp IV on the South Col at 7,920 m (26,000 ft).\n\n\nFrom Camp III to Camp IV, climbers are faced with two additional challenges: the Geneva Spur and the Yellow Band. The Geneva Spur is an anvil-shaped rib of black rock named by the 1952 Swiss expedition. Fixed ropes assist climbers in scrambling over this snow-covered rock band. The Yellow Band is a section of interlayered marble, phyllite, and semischist, which also requires about 100 metres of rope for traversing it.[246]\n\n\nOn the South Col, climbers enter the death zone. Climbers making summit bids typically can endure no more than two or three days at this altitude. If the weather is not clear with low winds during these short few days, climbers are forced to descend, many all the way back down to Base Camp.\n\n\nFrom Camp IV, climbers begin their summit push around midnight, with hopes of reaching the summit (still another 1,000 metres above) within 10 to 12 hours. Climbers first reach \"The Balcony\" at 8,400 m (27,600 ft), a small platform where they can rest and gaze at peaks to the south and east in the early light of dawn. Continuing up the ridge, climbers are then faced with a series of imposing rock steps which usually forces them to the east into the waist-deep snow, a serious avalanche hazard. At 8,750 m (28,700 ft), a small table-sized dome of ice and snow marks the South Summit.[246]\n\n\nFrom the South Summit, climbers follow the knife-edge southeast ridge along what is known as the \"Cornice traverse\", where snow clings to intermittent rock. This is the most exposed section of the climb, and a misstep to the left would send one 2,400 m (7,900 ft) down the southwest face, while to the immediate right is the 3,050 m (10,010 ft) Kangshung Face. At the end of this traverse is an imposing 12 m (39 ft) rock wall, the Hillary Step, at 8,790 m (28,840 ft).[247]\n\n\nHillary and Tenzing were the first climbers to ascend this step, and they did so using primitive ice climbing equipment and ropes. Nowadays, climbers ascend this step using fixed ropes previously set up by Sherpas. Once above the step, it is a comparatively easy climb to the top on moderately angled snow slopes—though the exposure on the ridge is extreme, especially while traversing large cornices of snow. With increasing numbers of people climbing the mountain in recent[*when?*] years, the Step has frequently become a bottleneck, with climbers forced to wait significant amounts of time for their turn on the ropes, leading to problems in getting climbers efficiently up and down the mountain.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAfter the Hillary Step, climbers also must traverse a loose and rocky section that has a large entanglement of fixed ropes that can be troublesome in bad weather. Climbers typically spend less than half an hour at the summit to allow time to descend to Camp IV before darkness sets in, to avoid serious problems with afternoon weather, or because supplemental oxygen tanks run out.\n\n\n\n#### North ridge route[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Three Steps\n\n![](image)Mount Everest north face from Rongbuk in Tibet\nThe north ridge route begins from the north side of Everest, in Tibet. Expeditions trek to the Rongbuk Glacier, setting up base camp at 5,180 m (16,990 ft) on a gravel plain just below the glacier. To reach Camp II, climbers ascend the medial moraine of the east Rongbuk Glacier up to the base of Changtse, at around 6,100 m (20,000 ft). Camp III (ABC – Advanced Base Camp) is situated below the North Col at 6,500 m (21,300 ft). To reach Camp IV on the North Col, climbers ascend the glacier to the foot of the col where fixed ropes are used to reach the North Col at 7,010 m (23,000 ft). From the North Col, climbers ascend the rocky north ridge to set up Camp V at around 7,775 m (25,500 ft). The route crosses the North Face in a diagonal climb to the base of the Yellow Band, reaching the site of Camp VI at 8,230 m (27,000 ft). From Camp VI, climbers make their final summit push.\n\n\nClimbers face a treacherous traverse from the base of the First Step: ascending from 8,501 to 8,534 m (27,890 to 28,000 ft), to the crux of the climb, the Second Step, ascending from 8,577 to 8,626 m (28,140 to 28,300 ft). (The Second Step includes a climbing aid called the \"Chinese ladder\", a metal ladder placed semi-permanently in 1975 by a party of Chinese climbers.[248] It has been almost continuously in place since, and ladders have been used by virtually all climbers on the route.) Once above the Second Step the inconsequential Third Step is clambered over, ascending from 8,690 to 8,800 m (28,510 to 28,870 ft). Once above these steps, the summit pyramid is climbed by a snow slope of 50 degrees, to the final summit ridge along which the top is reached.[249]\n\n\n\n### Summit[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A view from the summit of Mount Everest in May 2013\nThe summit of Everest has been described as \"the size of a dining room table\".[250] The summit is capped with snow over ice over rock, and the layer of snow varies from year to year.[251] The rock summit is made of Ordovician limestone and is a low-grade metamorphic rock.[252] (see the Surveys section for more on its height and about the Everest rock summit)\n\n\nBelow the summit, there is an area known as \"rainbow valley\", filled with dead bodies still wearing brightly coloured winter gear. Down to about 8,000 m (26,000 ft) is an area commonly called the \"death zone\", due to the high danger and low oxygen because of the low pressure.[83]\n\n\nBelow the summit the mountain slopes downward to the three main sides, or faces, of Mount Everest: the North Face, the South-West Face, and the East/Kangshung Face.[253][*better source needed*]\n\n\n\n### Death zone[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Effects of high altitude on humans\n\n![](image)The summit of Mount Everest from the North side\n![](image)From Kala Patthar, Nepal\nAt the higher regions of Mount Everest, climbers seeking the summit typically spend substantial time within the death zone (altitudes higher than 8,000 metres (26,000 ft)), and face significant challenges to survival. Temperatures can dip to very low levels, resulting in frostbite of any body part exposed to the air. Since temperatures are so low, snow is well-frozen in certain areas and death or injury by slipping and falling can occur. High winds at these altitudes on Everest are also a potential threat to climbers.\n\n\nAnother significant threat to climbers is low atmospheric pressure. The atmospheric pressure at the top of Everest is about a third of sea level pressure or 0.333 standard atmospheres (337 mbar), resulting in the availability of only about a third as much oxygen to breathe.[254]\n\n\nDebilitating effects of the death zone are so great that it takes most climbers up to 12 hours to walk the distance of 1.72 kilometres (1.07 mi) from South Col to the summit.[255] Achieving even this level of performance requires prolonged altitude acclimatisation, which takes 40–60 days for a typical expedition. A sea-level dweller exposed to the atmospheric conditions at the altitude above 8,500 m (27,900 ft) without acclimatisation would likely lose consciousness within 2 to 3 minutes.[256]\n\n\nIn May 2007, the Caudwell Xtreme Everest undertook a medical study of oxygen levels in human blood at extreme altitude. Over 200 volunteers climbed to Everest Base Camp where various medical tests were performed to examine blood oxygen levels. A small team also performed tests on the way to the summit.[257] Even at base camp, the low partial pressure of oxygen had direct effect on blood oxygen saturation levels. At sea level, blood oxygen saturation is generally 98 to 99 per cent. At base camp, blood saturation fell to between 85 and 87 per cent. Blood samples taken at the summit indicated very low oxygen levels in the blood. A side effect of low blood oxygen is a greatly increased breathing rate, often 80–90 breaths per minute as opposed to a more typical 20–30. Exhaustion can occur merely by attempting to breathe.[258]\n\n\nLack of oxygen, exhaustion, extreme cold, and climbing hazards all contribute to the death toll. An injured person who cannot walk is in serious trouble, since rescue by helicopter is generally impractical and carrying the person off the mountain is very risky. People who die during the climb are typically left behind. As of 2015, over 200 bodies remain on the mountain. It is not uncommon to find corpses near the standard climbing routes.[6]\n\n\n\n\n> Debilitating symptoms consistent with high altitude cerebral oedema commonly present during descent from the summit of Mount Everest. Profound fatigue and late times in reaching the summit are early features associated with subsequent death.\n> \n> — Mortality on Mount Everest, 1921–2006: descriptive study[259]\n> \n\n\nA 2008 study noted that the \"death zone\" is indeed where most Everest deaths occur, but also noted that most deaths occur during descent from the summit.[260] A 2014 article in *The Atlantic* about deaths on Everest noted that while falling is one of the greatest dangers the death zone presents for all 8000ers, avalanches are a more common cause of death at lower altitudes.[261] However, Everest climbing is more deadly than BASE jumping, although some have combined extreme sports and Everest, including a Russian who base-jumped off Everest in a wingsuit (though he did survive).[262]\n\n\nDespite this, Everest is safer for climbers than a number of peaks by some measurements, but it depends on the period.[263] Some examples are Kangchenjunga, K2, Annapurna, Nanga Parbat, and the Eiger (especially the *nordwand*).[263] Some factors that affect total mountain lethality include the level of popularity of the mountain, the skill of those climbing, and the difficulty of the climb.[264]\n\n\nAnother health hazard is retinal haemorrhages, which can damage eyesight and cause blindness.[265] Up to a quarter of Everest climbers can experience retinal haemorrhages, and although they usually heal within weeks of returning to lower altitudes, in 2010 a climber went blind and ended up dying in the death zone.[265]\n\n\n\n\n> At one o'clock in the afternoon, the British climber Peter Kinloch was on the roof of the world, in bright sunlight, taking photographs of the Himalayas below, \"elated, cheery and bubbly\". But Mount Everest is now his grave, because only minutes later, he suddenly went blind and had to be abandoned to die from the cold.\n> \n> — A. McSmith[265]\n> \n\n\nThe team made a huge effort for the next 12 hours to try to get him down the mountain, but to no avail, as they were unsuccessful in getting him through the difficult sections.[266] Even for the able, the Everest North-East ridge is recognised as a challenge. It is hard to rescue someone who has become incapacitated and it can be beyond the ability of rescuers to save *anyone* in such a difficult spot.[266] One way around this situation was pioneered by two Nepali men in 2011, who had intended to paraglide off the summit. They had no choice and were forced to go through with their plan anyway, because they had run out of bottled oxygen and supplies.[267] They successfully launched off the summit and para-glided down to Namche Bazaar in just 42 minutes, without having to climb down the mountain.[267]\n\n\n\n### Supplemental oxygen[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Climber at the summit wearing an oxygen mask\n![](image)Available oxygen at Everest\nMost expeditions use oxygen masks and tanks above 8,000 m (26,000 ft).[268] Everest can be climbed without supplementary oxygen, but only by the most accomplished mountaineers and at increased risk. Humans' ability to think clearly is hindered with low oxygen, and the combination of extreme weather, low temperatures, and steep slopes often requires quick, accurate decisions. While about 95 per cent of climbers who reach the summit use bottled oxygen in order to reach the top, about five per cent of climbers have summited Everest without supplemental oxygen. The death rate is double for those who attempt to reach the summit without supplemental oxygen.[269] Travelling above 2,400 m (8,000 ft) altitude is a factor in cerebral hypoxia.[270] One study found that Mount Everest may be the highest an acclimatised human could go, but also found that climbers may suffer permanent neurological damage despite returning to lower altitudes.[270]\n\n\nThe use of bottled oxygen to ascend Mount Everest has been controversial. It was first used on the 1922 British Mount Everest Expedition by George Finch and Geoffrey Bruce who climbed up to 7,800 m (25,600 ft) at a spectacular speed of 300 vertical metres (1,000 ft) per hour. Pinned down by a fierce storm, they escaped death by breathing oxygen from a jury-rigged set-up during the night. The next day they climbed to 8,100 m (26,600 ft) at 270 m/h (900 ft/h) – nearly three times as fast as non-oxygen users. Yet the use of oxygen was considered so unsportsmanlike that none of the rest of the Alpine world recognised this high ascent rate.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nGeorge Mallory described the use of such oxygen as unsportsmanlike, but he later concluded that it would be impossible for him to summit without it and consequently used it on his final attempt in 1924.[271] When Tenzing and Hillary made the first successful summit in 1953, they also used open-circuit bottled oxygen sets, with the expedition's physiologist Griffith Pugh referring to the oxygen debate as a \"futile controversy\", noting that oxygen \"greatly increases subjective appreciation of the surroundings, which after all is one of the chief reasons for climbing.\"[272] For the next twenty-five years, bottled oxygen was considered standard for any successful summit.\n\n\n\n\n> ...although an acclimatised lowlander can survive for a time on the summit of Everest without supplemental oxygen, one is so close to the limit that even a modicum of excess exertion may impair brain function.\n> \n> — Thomas F. Hornbein in *The high-altitude brain*[270]\n> \n\n\nReinhold Messner was the first climber to break the bottled oxygen tradition and in 1978, with Peter Habeler, made the first successful climb without it. In 1980, Messner summited the mountain solo, without supplemental oxygen or any porters or climbing partners, on the more difficult northwest route. Once the climbing community was satisfied that the mountain could be climbed without supplemental oxygen, many purists then took the next logical step of insisting that is how it *should* be climbed.[24]: 154\n\n\nThe aftermath of the 1996 disaster further intensified the debate. Jon Krakauer's *Into Thin Air* (1997) expressed the author's personal criticisms of the use of bottled oxygen. Krakauer wrote that the use of bottled oxygen allowed otherwise unqualified climbers to attempt to summit, leading to dangerous situations and more deaths. The disaster was partially caused by the sheer number of climbers (34 on that day) attempting to ascend, causing bottlenecks at the Hillary Step and delaying many climbers, most of whom summited after the usual 14:00 turnaround time. He proposed banning bottled oxygen except for emergency cases, arguing that this would both decrease the growing pollution on Everest—many bottles have accumulated on its slopes—and keep marginally qualified climbers off the mountain.\n\n\nThe 1996 disaster also introduced the issue of the guide's role in using bottled oxygen.[273]\n\n\nGuide Anatoli Boukreev's decision not to use bottled oxygen was sharply criticised by Jon Krakauer. Boukreev's supporters (who include G. Weston DeWalt, who co-wrote *The Climb*) state that using bottled oxygen gives a false sense of security.[274] Krakauer and his supporters point out that, without bottled oxygen, Boukreev could not directly help his clients descend.[275] They state that Boukreev said that he was going down with client Martin Adams,[275] but just below the south summit, Boukreev determined that Adams was doing fine on the descent and so descended at a faster pace, leaving Adams behind. Adams states in *The Climb*, \"For me, it was business as usual, Anatoli's going by, and I had no problems with that.\"[276]\n\n\nThe low oxygen can cause a mental fog-like impairment of cognitive abilities described as \"delayed and lethargic thought process, clinically defined as bradypsychia\" even after returning to lower altitudes.[277] In severe cases, climbers can experience hallucinations. Some studies have found that high-altitude climbers, including Everest climbers, experience altered brain structure.[277] The effects of high altitude on the brain, particularly if it can cause permanent brain damage, continue to be studied.[277]\n\n\n\n### Autumn climbing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Everest in September 2006\nAlthough generally less popular than spring, Mount Everest has also been climbed in the autumn (also called the \"post-monsoon season\").[66][278] For example, in 2010 Eric Larsen and five Nepali guides summited Everest in the autumn for the first time in ten years.[278] The autumn season, when the monsoon ends, is regarded as more dangerous because there is typically a lot of new snow which can be unstable.[279] However, this increased snow can make it more popular with certain winter sports like skiing and snowboarding.[66] Two Japanese climbers also summited in October 1973.[280]\n\n\nChris Chandler and Bob Cormack summited Everest in October 1976 as part of the American Bicentennial Everest Expedition that year, the first Americans to make an autumn ascent of Mount Everest according to the *Los Angeles Times*.[281] By the 21st century, summer and autumn can be more popular with skiing and snowboard attempts on Mount Everest.[282] During the 1980s, climbing in autumn was actually more popular than in spring.[283] U.S. astronaut Karl Gordon Henize died in October 1993 on an autumn expedition, conducting an experiment on radiation. The amount of background radiation increases with higher altitudes.[284]\n\n\nThe mountain has also been climbed in the winter, but that is not popular because of the combination of cold high winds and shorter days.[285] By January the peak is typically battered by 170 mph (270 km/h) winds and the average temperature of the summit is around −33 °F (−36 °C).[66]\n\n\n\n### Selected climbing records[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Timeline of climbing Mount Everest\n\n![](image)The Khumbu Icefall in 2005\n![](image)The Western Cwm (\"Coom\"), with Everest on the left and Lhotse to the right\nBy the end of the 2010 climbing season, there had been 5,104 ascents to the summit by about 3,142 individuals.[153] Some notable \"firsts\" by climbers include:\n\n\n\n* **1922**: First climb to 8,000 metres (26,247 ft), by George Finch and Captain Geoffrey Bruce\n* **1952**: First climb to South Col by 1952 Swiss Mount Everest expedition\n* **1953**: First ascent, by Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary on 1953 British Mount Everest expedition\n* **1960**: First reported ascent from the North Ridge by Wang Fuzhou, Gonpo and Qu Yinhua of China.[7]\n* **1975**: First female ascent, by Junko Tabei (16 May).[153][286]\n* **1975**: First female ascent from the North Ridge, by Phanthog, deputy head of the second Chinese Everest expedition that sent nine climbers to the summit (27 May).[287][288][289]\n* **1978**: First ascent without supplemental oxygen by Reinhold Messner and Peter Habeler[290]\n* **1978**: First solo ascent, by Franz Oppurg[291]\n* **1980**: First winter ascent, by Polish National Expedition Winter 1979/1980 (Leszek Cichy and Krzysztof Wielicki[292][293])\n* **1980**: Second solo ascent, and the first without supplemental oxygen, by Reinhold Messner[290]\n* **1981**: Third solo ascent, by Peter Hackett[294]\n* **1988**: First \"cross-over\" climb by Chinese, Japanese and Nepali teams which ascended the peak simultaneously from both the North and South sides of the mountain and descended down the other side.[286] The cross-over climb was also the first to be recorded on live broadcast television.\n* **1988**: First descent by paraglider, by Jean-Marc Boivin[295]\n* **1988**: First female ascent without supplemental oxygen by Lydia Bradey[296]\n* **1998**: Fastest to reach the summit via the southeast ridge (South Col), without supplemental oxygen, by Kazi Sherpa, in 20 hours and 24 minutes.[297][298][299]\n* **2000**: First descent by ski by Davo Karničar[300]\n* **2001**: First ascent by a blind climber, Erik Weihenmayer[301]\n* **2001**: Lhakpa Sherpa becomes first Nepali woman to summit Everest and survive.[302]\n* **2004**: Fastest to reach the summit via the southeast ridge (South Col), with supplemental oxygen, by Pemba Dorje, in 8 hours and 10 minutes.[303]\n* **2006**: Lhakpa Sherpa summits for the 6th time, breaking her own record for most successful female Everest climber.[304]\n* **2007**: Fastest to reach the summit via the northeast ridge, without supplemental oxygen, by Christian Stangl, in 16 hours, 42 minutes.[305][306]\n* **2010**: Youngest male to reach the summit, by Jordan Romero (13 years and 10 months old)[307]\n* **2011**: Most times to reach the summit, Apa Sherpa (21 times; 10 May 1990 – 11 May 2011)[308]\n* **2013**: Apa Sherpa tied for most times to reach the summit by Phurba Tashi (21 times; 1999–2013)\n* **2013**: Melissa Arnot, American, summits for the fifth time, breaking her own record for most successful summits by any non-Sherpa woman.[309]\n* **2014**: Youngest female to reach the summit, by Malavath Purna (13 years and 11 months old)\n* **2017**: Kami Rita Sherpa of Alpine Ascents reaches 21 ascents to the summit.[310][311]\n* **2019**: Kami Rita Sherpa reaches 24 ascents to the summit.[312]\n* **2021**: Kami Rita Sherpa reaches 25 ascents to the summit.[313][314]\n* **2022**: Kami Rita Sherpa reaches 26 ascents to the summit,[315] and Pasang Dawa Sherpa reaches 25 ascents to the summit.[316][317]\n* **2023**: Kami Rita Sherpa reaches 28 ascents to the summit.[318]\n\n\n### Summiting with disabilities[edit]\n\n\nSummiting Everest with disabilities such as amputations and diseases has become popular in the 21st century, with stories like that of Sudarshan Gautam, a man with no arms who made it to the top in 2013.[319] A teenager with Down's syndrome made it to Base camp, which has become a substitute for more extreme record-breaking because it carries many of the same thrills including the trip to the Himalayas and rustic scenery.[320] Danger lurks even at base camp though, which was the site where dozens were killed in the 2015 Mount Everest avalanches. Others that have climbed Everest with amputations include Mark Inglis (no legs), Hari Budha Magar (no legs), Paul Hockey (one arm only), and Arunima Sinha (one leg only).\n\n\nIn 2001, Erik Weihenmayer became the first person to reach the summit of Mount Everest while blind.[301]\n\n\n\n### Fake ascents[edit]\n\n\nIn 2021, Nepal banned three Indians for faking an ascent of Mount Everest in 2016.[321][322] In 2017, two Indian police officers, supposedly the first Indian couple to ascend Mount Everest, were sacked once it was found they had faked their ascent.[321]\n\n\n\n## Aviation[edit]\n\n\n### 1933: Flight over Everest[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Houston–Mount Everest flight expedition\n\nLucy, Lady Houston, a British millionaire former showgirl, funded the Houston Everest Flight of 1933.

Boivin said: \"I was tired when I reached the top because I had broken much of the trail, and to run at this altitude was quite hard.\"[324] Boivin ran 18 m (60 ft) from below the summit on 40-degree slopes to launch his paraglider, reaching Camp II at 5,900 m (19,400 ft) in 12 minutes (some sources say 11 minutes).[324][325] Boivin would not repeat this feat, as he was killed two years later in 1990, BASE-jumping off Venezuela's Angel Falls.[326]\n\n\n\n### 1991: Hot air balloon flyover[edit]\n\n\nIn 1991, four men in two balloons achieved the first hot-air balloon flight over Mount Everest.[327] In one balloon was Andy Elson and Eric Jones (cameraman), and in the other balloon Chris Dewhirst and Leo Dickinson (cameraman).[328] Dickinson went on to write a book about the adventure called *Ballooning Over Everest*.[328] The hot-air balloons were modified to function at up to 12,000 m (40,000 ft) altitude.[328] Reinhold Messner called one of Dickinson's panoramic views of Everest, captured on the now discontinued Kodak Kodachrome film, the \"best snap on Earth\", according to UK newspaper *The Telegraph*.[329] Dewhirst has offered to take passengers on a repeat of this feat for US$2.6 million per passenger.[327]\n\n\n\n### 2005: Pilot summits with helicopter[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Photo of a Eurocopter AS350 B3 \"Squirrel\"\nIn May 2005, pilot Didier Delsalle of France landed a Eurocopter AS350 B3 helicopter on the summit of Mount Everest.[330] He needed to land for two minutes to set the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI) official record, but he stayed for about four minutes, twice.[330] In this type of landing the rotors stay engaged, which avoids relying on the snow to fully support the aircraft. The flight set rotorcraft world records, for highest of both landing and take-off.[331]\n\n\nSome press reports suggested that the report of the summit landing was a misunderstanding of a South Col landing, but he had also landed on South Col two days earlier,[332] with this landing and the Everest records confirmed by the FAI.[331] Delsalle also rescued two Japanese climbers at 4,880 m (16,000 ft) while he was there. One climber noted that the new record meant a better chance of rescue.[330]\n\n\n\n### 2011: Paraglide off summit[edit]\n\n\nOn 21 May 2011, Nepalis Lakpa Tsheri Sherpa and Sano Bapu Sunuwar paraglided from Everest's summit to Namche Bazaar in 42 minutes.[267][333] After the flight they hiked, biked, and kayaked to the Indian Ocean, reaching the Bay of Bengal by 27 June 2011, thereby becoming the first persons to complete a continuous summit-to-sea descent from Everest.[334] They accomplished the ground-breaking feat despite Bapu having never previously climbed, and Lakpa having never kayaked and not even knowing how to swim.[334] The duo subsequently won National Geographic Adventurers of the Year for 2012 for their exploits.[334] In 2013 footage of the flight was shown on the television news program *Nightline*.[335]\n\n\n\n### 2014: Helicopter-assisted ascent[edit]\n\n\nIn 2014, a team financed and led by mountaineer Wang Jing used a helicopter to fly from South base camp to Camp 2 to avoid the Khumbu Icefall, and thence climbed to the Everest summit.[336] This climb immediately sparked outrage and controversy in much of the mountaineering world over the legitimacy and propriety of her climb.[168][337] Nepal ended up investigating Wang, who initially denied the claim that she had flown to Camp 2, admitting only that some support crew were flown to that higher camp, over the Khumbu Icefall.[338] In August 2014, however, she stated that she had flown to Camp 2 because the icefall was impassable. \"If you don't fly to Camp II, you just go home\", she said in an interview. In that same interview, she also insisted that she had never tried to hide this fact.[168]\n\n\nHer team had had to use the south side because the Chinese had denied them a permit to climb. Ultimately, the Chinese refusal may have been beneficial to Nepal's interests, allowing the government to showcase improved local hospitals and providing the opportunity for a new hybrid aviation/mountaineering style, triggering discussions about helicopter use in the mountaineering world.[168] National Geographic noted that a village festooned Wang with honours after she donated US$30,000 to the town's hospital. Wang won the International Mountaineer of the Year Award from the Nepal government in June 2014.[336]\n\n\n\n### 2016: Helicopter business increases[edit]\n\n\nIn 2016 the increased use of helicopters was noted for increased efficiency and for hauling material over the deadly Khumbu icefall.[339] In particular it was noted that flights saved icefall porters 80 trips but still increased commercial activity at Everest.[339] After many Nepalis died in the icefall in 2014, the government had wanted helicopters to handle more transportation to Camp 1 but this was not possible because of the 2015 earthquake closing the mountain, so this was then implemented in 2016 (helicopters did prove instrumental in rescuing many people in 2015 though).[339] That summer Bell tested the 412EPI, which conducted a series of tests including hovering at 5,500 m (18,000 ft) and flying as high as 6,100 m (20,000 ft) altitude near Mount Everest.[340]\n\n\n\n## Commercial climbing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Top down view showing the location of the summit, and its three main faces/sides\n![](image)Everest Base Camp\n![](image)Gorak Shep is about a three-hour walk to South EBC (Everest Base Camp).[341]\nAccording to Jon Krakauer, the era of commercialisation of Everest started in 1985, when the summit was reached by a guided expedition led by David Breashears that included Richard Bass, a wealthy 55-year-old businessman and an amateur mountain climber with only four years of climbing experience.[342] By the early-1990s, several companies were offering guided tours to the mountain. Rob Hall, one of the mountaineers who died in the 1996 disaster, had successfully guided 39 clients to the summit before that incident.[24]: 24, 42\n\n\nBy 2016, most guiding services cost between US$35,000 and US$200,000.[343] Going with a \"celebrity guide\", usually a well-known mountaineer typically with decades of climbing experience and perhaps several Everest summits, can cost over £100,000 as of 2015.[344] However, the services offered vary widely and it is \"buyer beware\" when doing deals in Nepal, one of the poorest and least developed countries in the world.[343][345] Tourism contributed 7.9 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019[346] in a country with high unemployment,[347] but Everest is special in that an Everest porter can make nearly double the nation's average wage in a region in which other sources of income are lacking.[348]\n\n\nCosts beyond the guiding service can vary widely. It is technically possible to reach the summit with minimal additional expenses, and there are \"budget\" travel agencies that offer logistical support for such trips. A limited support service, offering only some meals at base camp and bureaucratic overhead like a permit, can cost as little as US$7,000 as of 2007.[141] However, this is considered difficult and dangerous (as illustrated by the case of David Sharp).\n\n\nClimbing gear required to reach the summit may cost in excess of US$8,000, and most climbers also use bottled oxygen, which adds around US$3,000.[349] The permit to enter the Everest area from the south via Nepal costs US$10,000 to US$30,000 per person, depending on the size of the team.[349] The ascent typically starts at one of the two base camps near the mountain, both of which are approximately 100 kilometres (60 mi) from Kathmandu and 300 kilometres (190 mi) from Lhasa (the two nearest cities with major airports). Transferring one's equipment from the airport to the base camp may add as much as US$2,000.[349]\n\n\nMany climbers hire \"full service\" guide companies, which provide a wide spectrum of services, including the acquisition of permits, transportation to/from base camp, food, tents, fixed ropes,[350] medical assistance while on the mountain, an experienced mountaineer guide, and even personal porters to carry one's backpack and cook one's meals. The cost of such a guide service may range from US$40,000 to $80,000 per person.[351] Since most equipment is moved by Sherpas, clients of full-service guide companies can often keep their backpack weights under 10 kilograms (22 lb), or hire a Sherpa to carry their backpack for them. By contrast, climbers attempting less commercialised peaks, like Denali, are often expected to carry backpacks over 30 kilograms (66 lb) and, occasionally, to tow a sled with 35 kilograms (77 lb) of gear and food.[352]\n\n\nThe degree of commercialisation of Mount Everest is a frequent subject of criticism.[158] Jamling Tenzing Norgay, the son of Tenzing Norgay, said in a 2003 interview that his late father would have been shocked to discover that rich thrill-seekers with no climbing experience were now routinely reaching the summit, \"You still have to climb this mountain yourself with your feet. But the spirit of adventure is not there any more. It is lost. There are people going up there who have no idea how to put on crampons. They are climbing because they have paid someone $65,000. It is very selfish. It endangers the lives of others.\"[353]\n\n\nOne example of this is Shriya Shah-Klorfine, who had to be taught how to put on crampons during her summit attempt in 2012.[354] She paid at least US$40,000 to a new guiding company for the trip, and died when she ran out of oxygen during the descent after climbing for 27 hours straight.[355]\n\n\nReinhold Messner concurred in 2004, \"You could die in each climb and that meant you were responsible for yourself. We were real mountaineers: careful, aware and even afraid. By climbing mountains we were not learning how big we were. We were finding out how breakable, how weak and how full of fear we are. You can only get this if you expose yourself to high danger. I have always said that a mountain without danger is not a mountain....High altitude alpinism has become tourism and show. These commercial trips to Everest, they are still dangerous. But the guides and organisers tell clients, 'Don't worry, it's all organised.' The route is prepared by hundreds of Sherpas. Extra oxygen is available in all camps, right up to the summit. People will cook for you and lay out your beds. Clients feel safe and don't care about the risks.\"[356]\n\n\nBy 2015, Nepal was considering requiring that climbers have some experience, hoping this would both make the mountain safer and increase revenue.[357] One barrier to this is that low-budget firms make money *not* taking inexperienced climbers to the summit.[343] Those turned away by Western firms can often find another firm willing to take them for a price—that they return home soon after arriving after base camp, or part way up the mountain.[343] Whereas a Western firm will convince those they deem incapable to turn back, other firms simply give people the freedom to choose.[343]\n\n\nHowever, not all opinions on the subject among prominent mountaineers have been strictly negative. For example, Edmund Hillary stated in 2003 that while \"Having people pay $65,000 and then be led up the mountain by a couple of experienced guides...isn't really mountaineering at all\",[358] he was pleased by the changes brought to Everest area by Westerners, \"I don't have any regrets because I worked very hard indeed to improve the condition for the local people. When we first went in there they didn't have any schools, they didn't have any medical facilities, all over the years we have established 27 schools, we have two hospitals and a dozen medical clinics and then we've built bridges over wild mountain rivers and put in fresh water pipelines so in cooperation with the Sherpas we've done a lot to benefit them.\"[359]\n\n\nOne of the early guided summiters, Richard Bass (of Seven Summits fame) stated in 2003 that \"Climbers should have high altitude experience before they attempt the really big mountains. People don't realise the difference between a 20,000-foot [6,100 m] mountain and 29,000-foot [8,800 m]. It's not just arithmetic. The reduction of oxygen in the air is proportionate to the altitude alright, but the effect on the human body is disproportionate—an exponential curve. People climb Denali [6,190 m or 20,320 ft] or Aconcagua [6,960 m or 22,834 ft] and think, 'Heck, I feel great up here, I'm going to try Everest.' But it's not like that.\"[360]\n\n\n\n### Thefts and crime[edit]\n\n\nSome climbers have reported life-threatening thefts from supply caches. In May 2006, Vitor Negrete, the first Brazilian to climb Everest without oxygen and part of David Sharp's party, died during his descent, and theft of gear and food from his high-altitude camp may have contributed.[361][362]\n\n\n\"Several members were bullied, gear was stolen, and threats were made against me and my climbing partner, Michael Kodas, making an already stressful situation even more dire\", said one climber.[363]\n\n\nIn addition to theft, Michael Kodas describes in his book, *High Crimes: The Fate of Everest in an Age of Greed* (2008):[364] unethical guides and Sherpas, prostitution and gambling at the Tibet Base Camp, fraud related to the sale of oxygen bottles, and climbers collecting donations under the pretense of removing trash from the mountain.[365][366]\n\n\nThe Chinese side of Everest in Tibet was described as \"out of control\" in 2007 after one Canadian had all his gear stolen and was abandoned by his Sherpa.[367] Another Sherpa helped the victim get off the mountain safely and gave him some spare gear. Other climbers have also reported missing oxygen bottles, which can be worth hundreds of dollars each. Hundreds of climbers pass by people's tents, making it hard to safeguard against theft.[367] In the late 2010s, the reports of theft of oxygen bottles from camps became more common.[368]\n\n\n\n## 2014 Sherpa strike[edit]\n\n\nOn 18 April 2014, in one of the worst disasters to ever hit the Everest climbing community up to that time, 16 Sherpas died in Nepal due to the avalanche that swept them off Mount Everest. In response to the tragedy, numerous Sherpa climbing guides walked off the job and most climbing companies pulled out in respect for the Sherpa people mourning the loss.[369][370] Some still wanted to climb but there was too much controversy to continue that year.[369] One of the issues that triggered the work action by Sherpas was unreasonable client demands during climbs.[369]\n\n\n\n## Extreme sports at Mount Everest[edit]\n\n\nMount Everest has been host to other winter sports and adventuring besides mountaineering, including snowboarding, skiing, paragliding, and BASE jumping.\n\n\nYuichiro Miura became the first man to ski down Everest in the 1970s. He descended nearly 1,300 vertical metres (4,200 ft) from the South Col before falling with extreme injuries.[90] Stefan Gatt and Marco Siffredi snowboarded Mount Everest in 2001.[371] Other Everest skiers include Davo Karničar of Slovenia, who completed a top to south base camp descent in 2000, Hans Kammerlander of Italy in 1996 on the north side,[372] and Kit DesLauriers of the United States in 2006.[373] In 2006 Swede Tomas Olsson and Norwegian Tormod Granheim skied together down the north face. Olsson's anchor broke while they were rappelling down a cliff in the Norton couloir at about 8,500 metres, resulting in his death from a two and a half-kilometre fall. Granheim skied down to camp III.[374] Also, Marco Siffredi died in 2002 on his second snow-boarding expedition.[371]\n\n\nVarious types of gliding descents have slowly become more popular, and are noted for their rapid descents to lower camps. In 1986 Steve McKinney led an expedition to Mount Everest,[375] during which he became the first person to fly a hang-glider off the mountain.[325] Frenchman Jean-Marc Boivin made the first paraglider descent of Everest in September 1988, descending in minutes from the south-east ridge to a lower camp.[295] In 2011, two Nepalis made a gliding descent from the Everest summit down 5,000 metres (16,400 ft) in 45 minutes.[376] On 5 May 2013, the beverage company Red Bull sponsored Valery Rozov, who successfully BASE jumped off of the mountain while wearing a wingsuit, setting a record for world's highest BASE jump in the process.[262][377]\n\n\n\n## Everest and religion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Rongphu Monastery, with Mount Everest in the background\nThe southern part of Mount Everest is regarded as one of several \"hidden valleys\" of refuge designated by Padmasambhava, a ninth-century \"lotus-born\" Buddhist saint.[378]\n\n\nNear the base of the north side of Everest lies Rongbuk Monastery, which has been called the \"sacred threshold to Mount Everest, with the most dramatic views of the world.\"[379] For Sherpas living on the slopes of Everest in the Khumbu region of Nepal, Rongbuk Monastery is an important pilgrimage site, accessed in a few days of travel across the Himalayas through Nangpa La.[105]\n\n\nMiyolangsangma, a Tibetan Buddhist \"*Goddess of Inexhaustible Giving*\", is believed to have lived at the top of Mount Everest. According to Sherpa Buddhist monks, Mount Everest is Miyolangsangma's palace and playground, and all climbers are only partially welcome guests, having arrived without invitation.[378]\n\n\nThe Sherpa people also believe that Mount Everest and its flanks are blessed with spiritual energy, and one should show reverence when passing through this sacred landscape. Here, the karmic effects of one's actions are magnified, and impure thoughts are best avoided.[378]\n\n\n\n## Waste management[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Impacts of tourism § Mount Everest\n\nIn 2015, the president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association warned that pollution, especially human waste, has reached critical levels. As much as 12,000 kg (26,500 lb) of human excrement each season is left behind on the mountain.[380] Human waste is strewn across the verges of the route to the summit, making the four sleeping areas on the route up Everest's south side minefields of human excrement. Climbers above Base Camp—for the 62-year history of climbing on the mountain—have most commonly either buried their excrement in holes they dug by hand in the snow, or slung it into crevasses, or simply defecated wherever convenient, often within metres of their tents. The only place where climbers can defecate without worrying about contaminating the mountain is Base Camp. At approximately 5,500 m (18,000 ft), Base Camp sees the most activity of all camps on Everest because climbers acclimate and rest there. In the late-1990s, expeditions began using toilets that they fashioned from blue plastic 190-litre (50-US-gallon) barrels fitted with a toilet seat and enclosed.[381]\n\n\nThe problem of human waste is compounded by the presence of more anodyne waste: spent oxygen tanks, abandoned tents, empty cans and bottles. The Nepali government now requires each climber to pack out eight kilograms of waste when descending the mountain.[382]\n\n\nIn February 2019, due to the mounting waste problem, China closed the base camp on its side of Everest to visitors without climbing permits. Tourists are allowed to go as far as the Rongbuk Monastery.[383]\n\n\nIn April 2019, the Solukhumbu district's Khumbu Pasanglhamu Rural Municipality launched a campaign to collect nearly 10,000 kg of garbage from Everest.[384]\n\n\n\n## Context and maps[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n3D rendering of Mount Everest and surrounding terrain\n\nNearby peaks include Lhotse, 8,516 m (27,940 ft); Nuptse, 7,855 m (25,771 ft), and Changtse, 7,580 m (24,870 ft) among others. Another nearby peak is Khumbutse, and many of the highest mountains in the world are near Mount Everest. On the southwest side, a major feature in the lower areas is the Khumbu icefall and glacier, an obstacle to climbers on those routes but also to the base camps.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nSouthern and northern climbing routes as seen from the International Space Station.

However, for a peak rising out of relatively flat terrain, such as Mauna Kea or Denali, an \"approximate\" height above \"base\" can be calculated. Everest is more complicated since it only rises above relatively flat terrain on its north (Tibetan Plateau) side. Hence the concept of \"base\" has even less meaning for Everest than for Mauna Kea or Denali, and the range of numbers for \"height above base\" is wider. In general, comparisons based on \"height above base\" are somewhat suspect.\n6. **^** In the table below, the temperature given is the average lowest temperature recorded in that month.

Air at that altitude already contains only one third as much oxygen as sea-level air.\n130. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Beck Weathers\". *Badass of the Week*.\n131. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Weathers, Beck (May 2000). \"My Journey Home From Everest\". *D Magazine*.

As of February 2021[update], only 377 people have summited K2.[13] There have been 91 deaths during attempted climbs.\n\n\nMost ascents are made during July and August, typically the warmest times of the year.[14] But in January 2021, K2 became the final eight-thousander to be summited in the winter; the mountaineering feat was accomplished by a team of Nepalese climbers, led by Nirmal Purja and Mingma Gyalje Sherpa.[15][16]\n\n\nK2 has now been climbed by almost all of its ridges, but unlike other eight-thousanders, never from its eastern face.[17]\n\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Montgomerie's original sketch from 1856 in which he applied the notation *K2*\nThe name *K2* is derived from the notation used by the Great Trigonometrical Survey of British India. Thomas Montgomerie made the first survey of the Karakoram from Mount Haramukh, some 210 km (130 mi) to the south, and sketched the two most prominent peaks, labelling them *K1* and *K2*, where the *K* stands for *Karakoram*.[18]\n\n\nThe policy of the Great Trigonometrical Survey was to use local names for mountains wherever possible[b] and K1 was found to be known locally as Masherbrum. K2, however, appeared not to have acquired a local name, possibly due to its remoteness. The mountain is not visible from Askole, one of the highest settlements on the way to the mountain, nor from the nearest habitation to the north. K2 is only fleetingly glimpsed from the end of the Baltoro Glacier, beyond which few local people would have ventured.[19] The name *Chogori*, derived from two Balti words, *chhogo* ཆོ་གྷའོ་ (\"big\") and *ri* རི (\"mountain\") (چھوغوری)[20] has been suggested as a local name,[21] but evidence for its widespread use is scant. It may have been a compound name invented by Western explorers[22] or simply a bemused reply to the question \"What's that called?\"[19] It does, however, form the basis for the name *Qogir* (simplified Chinese: 乔戈里峰; traditional Chinese: 喬戈里峰; pinyin: *Qiáogēlǐ Fēng*) by which Chinese authorities officially refer to the peak. Other local names have been suggested including *Lamba Pahar* (\"Tall Mountain\" in Urdu) and *Dapsang*, but these are not widely used.[19]\n\n\nWith the mountain lacking a local name, the name *Mount Godwin-Austen* was suggested, in honour of Henry Godwin-Austen, an early explorer of the area. While the name was rejected by the Royal Geographical Society,[19] it was used on several maps and continues to be used occasionally.[23][24]\n\n\nThe surveyor's mark, K2, therefore continues to be the name by which the mountain is commonly known. It is now also used in the Balti language, rendered as *Kechu* or *Ketu*[22][25] (Balti: کے چو Urdu: کے ٹو). The Italian climber Fosco Maraini argued in his account of the ascent of Gasherbrum IV that while the name of K2 owes its origin to chance, its clipped, impersonal nature is highly appropriate for so remote and challenging a mountain. He concluded that it was:\n\n\n\n\n> ... just the bare bones of a name, all rock and ice and storm and abyss. It makes no attempt to sound human. It is atoms and stars. It has the nakedness of the world before the first man—or of the cindered planet after the last.[26]\n> \n> \n\n\nAndré Weil named K3 surfaces in mathematics partly after the beauty of the mountain K2.[27]\n\n\n\n## Geographical setting[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map including K2 (labelled as *K2 (MOUNT GODWIN AUSTEN)* in upper left corner of map) (AMS, 1953)\nVirtual flight around K2\nK2 lies in the northwestern Karakoram Range. It is located in the Baltistan region of Gilgit–Baltistan, Pakistan, and the Taxkorgan Tajik Autonomous County of Xinjiang, China.[a] The Tarim sedimentary basin borders the range on the north and the Lesser Himalayas on the south. Melt waters from glaciers, such as those south and east of K2, feed agriculture in the valleys and contribute significantly to the regional fresh-water supply.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nK2 is ranked 22nd by topographic prominence, a measure of a mountain's independent stature. It is a part of the same extended area of uplift (including the Karakoram, the Tibetan Plateau, and the Himalayas) as Mount Everest, and it is possible to follow a path from K2 to Everest that goes no lower than 4,594 metres (15,072 ft), at the Kora La on the Nepal/China border in the Mustang Lo. Many other peaks far lower than K2 are more independent in this sense. It is, however, the most prominent peak within the Karakoram range.[2]\n\n\nK2 is notable for its local relief as well as its total height. It stands over 3,000 metres (9,840 ft) above much of the glacial valley bottoms at its base. It is a consistently steep pyramid, dropping quickly in almost all directions. The north side is the steepest: there it rises over 3,200 metres (10,500 ft) above the K2 (Qogir) Glacier in only 3,000 metres (9,800 ft) of horizontal distance. In most directions, it achieves over 2,800 metres (9,200 ft) of vertical relief in less than 4,000 metres (13,000 ft).[28]\n\n\nA 1986 expedition led by George Wallerstein made an inaccurate measurement showing that K2 was taller than Mount Everest, and therefore the tallest mountain in the world.[29] A corrected measurement was made in 1987, but by then the claim that K2 was the tallest mountain in the world had already made it into many news reports and reference works.[30]\n\n\n\n## Height[edit]\n\n\nK2's height given on maps and encyclopedias is 8,611 metres (28,251 ft). In the summer of 2014, a Pakistani-Italian expedition to K2, named \"K2 60 Years Later\", was organized to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the first ascent of K2. One of the goals of the expedition was to accurately measure the height of the mountain using satellite navigation. The height of K2 measured during this expedition was 8,609.02 metres (28,244.8 ft).[31][32]\n\n\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\nThe mountains of K2 and Broad Peak, and the area westward to the lower reaches of Sarpo Laggo glacier, consist of metamorphic rocks, known as the *K2 Gneiss,* and part of the Karakoram Metamorphic Complex.[33][34] The K2 Gneiss consists of a mixture of orthogneiss and biotite-rich paragneiss. On the south and southeast face of K2, the orthogneiss consists of a mixture of a strongly foliated plagioclase-hornblende gneiss and a biotite-hornblende-K-feldspar orthogneiss, which has been intruded by garnet-mica leucogranitic dikes. In places, the paragneisses include clinopyroxene-hornblende-bearing psammites, garnet (grossular)-diopside marbles, and biotite-graphite phyllites. Near the memorial to the climbers who have died on K2, above Base Camp on the south spur, thin impure marbles with quartzites and mica schists, called the *Gilkey-Puchoz sequence*, are interbanded within the orthogneisses. On the west face of Broad Peak and the south spur of K2, lamprophyre dikes, which consist of clinopyroxene and biotite-porphyritic vogesites and minettes, have intruded the K2 gneiss. The K2 Gneiss is separated from the surrounding sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks of the surrounding Karakoram Metamorphic Complex by normal faults. For example, a fault separates the K2 gneiss of the east face of K2 from limestones and slates comprising nearby Skyang Kangri.[33][35]\n\n\n40Ar/39Ar ages of 115 to 120 million years ago obtained from and geochemical analyses of the K2 Gneiss demonstrate that it is a metamorphosed, older, Cretaceous, pre-collisional granite. The granitic precursor (protolith) to the K2 Gneiss originated as the result of the production of large bodies of magma by a northward-dipping subduction zone along what was the continental margin of Asia at that time and their intrusion as batholiths into its lower continental crust. During the initial collision of the Asia and Indian plates, this granitic batholith was buried to depths of about 20 kilometres (12 mi) or more, highly metamorphosed, highly deformed, and partially remelted during the Eocene Period to form gneiss. Later, the K2 Gneiss was then intruded by leucogranite dikes and finally exhumed and uplifted along major breakback thrust faults during post-Miocene time. The K2 Gneiss was exposed as the entire K2-Broad Peak-Gasherbrum range experienced rapid uplift with which erosion rates have been unable to keep pace.[33][36]\n\n\n\n## Climbing history[edit]\n\n\n### Early attempts[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The west face of K2 taken from the Savoia Glacier, on the 1909 expedition\nThe mountain was first surveyed by a British team in 1856. Team member Thomas Montgomerie designated the mountain \"K2\" for being the second peak of the Karakoram range. The other peaks were originally named K1, K3, K4, and K5, but were eventually renamed Masherbrum, Gasherbrum IV, Gasherbrum II, and Gasherbrum I, respectively.[37] In 1892, Martin Conway led a British expedition that reached \"Concordia\" on the Baltoro Glacier.[38]\n\n\nThe first serious attempt to climb K2 was undertaken in 1902 by Oscar Eckenstein, Aleister Crowley, Jules Jacot-Guillarmod, Heinrich Pfannl, Victor Wessely, and Guy Knowles via the Northeast Ridge. In the early 1900s, modern transportation did not exist in the region: it took \"fourteen days just to reach the foot of the mountain\".[39]\nAfter five serious and costly attempts, the team reached 6,525 metres (21,407 ft)[40]—although considering the difficulty of the challenge, and the lack of modern climbing equipment or weatherproof fabrics, Crowley's statement that \"neither man nor beast was injured\" highlights the relative skill of the ascent. The failures were also attributed to sickness (Crowley was suffering the residual effects of malaria), a combination of questionable physical training, personality conflicts, and poor weather conditions—of 68 days spent on K2 (at the time, the record for the longest time spent at such an altitude) only eight provided clear weather.[41]\n\n\nThe next expedition to K2, in 1909, led by Prince Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi, reached an elevation of around 6,250 metres (20,510 ft) on the South East Spur, now known as the *Abruzzi Spur* (or Abruzzi Ridge). This would eventually become part of the standard route, but was abandoned at the time due to its steepness and difficulty. After trying and failing to find a feasible alternative route on the West Ridge or the North East Ridge, the Duke declared that K2 would never be climbed, and the team switched its attention to Chogolisa, where the Duke came within 150 metres (490 ft) of the summit before being driven back by a storm.[42]\n\n\n\n![](image)K2 from the east, photographed during the 1909 expedition\nThe next attempt on K2 was not made until 1938, when the First American Karakoram expedition led by Charles Houston made a reconnaissance of the mountain. They concluded that the Abruzzi Spur was the most practical route and reached a height of around 8,000 meters (26,000 ft) before turning back due to diminishing supplies and the threat of bad weather.[43][44]\n\n\nThe following year, the 1939 American expedition led by Fritz Wiessner came within 200 metres (660 ft) of the summit but ended in disaster when Dudley Wolfe, Pasang Kikuli, Pasang Kitar, and Pintso disappeared high on the mountain.[45][46]\n\n\nCharles Houston returned to K2 to lead the 1953 American expedition. The attempt failed after a storm pinned down the team for 10 days at 7,800 metres (25,590 ft), during which time climber Art Gilkey became critically ill. A desperate retreat followed, during which Pete Schoening saved almost the entire team during a mass fall (known simply as The Belay), and Gilkey was killed, either in an avalanche or in a deliberate attempt to avoid burdening his companions. Despite the retreat and tragic end, the expedition has been given iconic status in mountaineering history.[47][48][49] The Gilkey Memorial was built in his memory at the mountain's foot.[50]\n\n\n\n### Success and repeats[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Achille Compagnoni on K2's summit on the first ascent (31 July 1954)\nThe 1954 Italian expedition finally succeeded in ascending to the summit of K2 via the Abruzzi Spur on 31 July 1954. The expedition was led by Ardito Desio, and the two climbers who reached the summit were Lino Lacedelli and Achille Compagnoni. The team included a Pakistani member, Colonel Muhammad Ata-ullah, who had been a part of the 1953 American expedition. Also on the expedition were Walter Bonatti and Pakistani Hunza porter Amir Mehdi, who both proved vital to the expedition's success in that they carried oxygen tanks to 8,100 metres (26,600 ft) for Lacedelli and Compagnoni. The ascent is controversial because Lacedelli and Compagnoni established their camp at a higher elevation than originally agreed with Mehdi and Bonatti. It being too dark to ascend or descend, Mehdi and Bonatti were forced to overnight without shelter above 8,000 metres (26,000 ft) leaving the oxygen tanks behind as requested when they descended. Bonatti and Mehdi survived, but Mehdi was hospitalised for months and had to have his toes amputated because of frostbite. Efforts in the 1950s to suppress these facts to protect Lacedelli and Compagnoni's reputations as Italian national heroes were later brought to light. It was also revealed that the moving of the camp was deliberate, a move apparently made because Compagnoni feared being outshone by the younger Bonatti. Bonatti was given the blame for Mehdi's hospitalisation.[51]\n\n\nOn 9 August 1977, 23 years after the Italian expedition, Ichiro Yoshizawa led the second successful ascent, with Ashraf Aman as the first native Pakistani climber. The Japanese expedition took the Abruzzi Spur and used more than 1,500 porters.[52]\n\n\nThe third ascent of K2 was in 1978, via a new route, the long and corniced Northeast Ridge. The top of the route traversed left across the East Face to avoid a vertical headwall and joined the uppermost part of the Abruzzi route. This ascent was made by an American team, led by James Whittaker; the summit party was Louis Reichardt, Jim Wickwire, John Roskelley, and Rick Ridgeway. Wickwire endured an overnight bivouac about 150 metres (490 ft) below the summit, one of the highest bivouacs in history. This ascent was emotional for the American team, as they saw themselves as completing a task that had been begun by the 1938 team forty years earlier.[53]\n\n\nAnother notable Japanese ascent was that of the difficult North Ridge on the Chinese side of the peak in 1982. A team from the Japan Mountaineering Association [ja] led by Isao Shinkai and Masatsugo Konishi [ja] put three members, Naoe Sakashita, Hiroshi Yoshino, and Yukihiro Yanagisawa, on the summit on 14 August. However Yanagisawa fell and died on the descent. Four other members of the team achieved the summit the next day.[54]\n\n\nThe first climber to reach the summit of K2 twice was Czech climber Josef Rakoncaj. Rakoncaj was a member of the 1983 Italian expedition led by Francesco Santon, which made the second successful ascent of the North Ridge (31 July 1983). Three years later, on 5 July 1986, he reached the summit via the Abruzzi Spur (double with Broad Peak West Face solo) as a member of Agostino da Polenza's international expedition.[55]\n\n\nThe first woman to summit K2 was Polish climber Wanda Rutkiewicz on 23 June 1986. Liliane and Maurice Barrard who had summited later that day, fell during the descent; Liliane Barrard's body was found on 19 July 1986 at the foot of the south face.[56]\n\n\nIn 1986, two Polish expeditions summited via two new routes, the Magic Line[57] and the Polish Line (Jerzy Kukuczka and Tadeusz Piotrowski). Piotrowski fell to his death as the two were descending. \n\n\nThirteen climbers from several expeditions died in the 1986 K2 disaster. Another six mountaineers died in the 1995 K2 disaster, while eleven climbers died in the 2008 K2 disaster.[58][59][*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Recent attempts[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of deaths on eight-thousanders § K2\n\n2004\nIn 2004, the Spanish climber Carlos Soria Fontán became the oldest person ever to summit K2, at the age of 65.[60]\n2008\nOn 1 August 2008, a group of climbers went missing after a large piece of ice fell during an avalanche, taking out the fixed ropes on part of the route; four climbers were rescued, but 11, including Meherban Karim from Pakistan[61] and Ger McDonnell, the first Irish person to reach the summit, were confirmed dead.[62]\n2009\nDespite several attempts, nobody reached the summit.[*citation needed*]\n2010\nOn 6 August 2010, Fredrik Ericsson, who intended to ski from the summit, joined Gerlinde Kaltenbrunner on the way to the summit of K2. Ericsson fell 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) and was killed. Kaltenbrunner aborted her summit attempt.[63]\nDespite several attempts, nobody reached the summit.[*citation needed*]\n2011\nOn 23 August 2011, a team of four climbers reached the summit of K2 from the North side. Gerlinde Kaltenbrunner became the first woman to complete all 14 eight-thousanders without supplemental oxygen.[64] Kazakhs Maxut Zhumayev and Vassiliy Pivtsov completed their eight-thousanders quest. The fourth team member was Dariusz Załuski from Poland.[65]\n2012\nThe year started with a Russian team aiming for a first winter ascent. The expedition ended with the death of Vitaly Gorelik due to frostbite and pneumonia. The Russian team cancelled the ascent.[66] In the summer season, K2 saw a record crowd standing on its summit—28 climbers in a single day—bringing the total for the year to 30.[67]\n2013\nOn 28 July 2013, two New Zealanders, Marty Schmidt and his son Denali, died after an avalanche destroyed their camp. A guide had reached their camp, but said they were nowhere to be seen and the campsite tent showed signs of having been hit by an avalanche. British climber Adrian Hayes, who was with the group, later posted on his Facebook page that the campsite had been wiped out.[68]\n2014\nOn 26 July 2014, the first team of Pakistani climbers scaled K2. There were six Pakistani and three Italian climbers in the expedition, called K2 60 Years Later, according to BBC. Previously, K2 had only been summited by individual Pakistanis as part of international expeditions.[69] Another team, consisting of Pasang Lhamu Sherpa Akita, Maya Sherpa, and Dawa Yangzum Sherpa, became the first Nepali women to climb K2.[70]\nOn 27 July 2014, Garrett Madison led a team of three American climbers and six Sherpas to summit K2.[71][72]\nOn 31 July 2014, Boyan Petrov completed the first Bulgarian ascent, just 8 days after climbing Broad Peak. Boyan is among the very few climbers with diabetes to climb above 7,000 metres (23,000 ft) without the use of supplemental oxygen.[73]\n2017\nOn 28 July 2017, Vanessa O'Brien led an international team of 12 with Mingma Gyalje Sherpa of Dreamers Destination to the summit of K2 and became the first British and American woman to summit K2, and the eldest woman to summit K2 at the age of 52 years old.[74] She paid tribute to Julie Tullis and Alison Hargreaves, two British women who summited K2, in 1986 and 1995 respectively, but died during their descents. Other notable summits included John Snorri Sigurjónsson and Dawa Gyalje Sherpa who joined his sister (Dawa Yangzum Sherpa), becoming the second set of siblings to summit K2.[75] Both Mingma Gyalje Sherpa and Fazal Ali recorded their second K2 summits.[*citation needed*]\n2018\nOn 22 July 2018, Garrett Madison became the first American climber to reach the summit of K2 more than once when he led an international team of eight climbers, nine Nepali Sherpas, four Pakistani high-altitude porters, and two other Madison Mountaineering guides to the summit.[76][77]\nOn 22 July 2018, Polish mountaineer and mountain runner Andrzej Bargiel became the first person to ski down from summit to base camp.[78]\n2019\nOn 25 July 2019, Anja Blacha became the first German woman to summit K2. She climbed without the use of supplemental oxygen.[79]\n2022\nOn 22 July 2022 more than 100 summits on K2 in a single day were recorded. This is the highest number of summits in a single day ever on K2.[80]\n### Winter expeditions[edit]\n\n\n* 1987/1988 — Polish-Canadian-British expedition led by Andrzej Zawada from the Pakistani side, consisting of 13 Poles, 7 Canadians and 4 Brits. 2 March Krzysztof Wielicki and Leszek Cichy established camp III at 7,300 metres (24,000 ft) above sea, followed by Roger Mear and Jean-Francois Gagnon few days later. Hurricane winds and frostbite forced the team to retreat.[81]\n* 2002/2003 — Netia K2 Polish Winter Expedition. The team of fourteen climbers was led by Krzysztof Wielicki, and included four members from Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Georgia. They intended to climb North Ridge. Marcin Kaczkan, Piotr Morawski and Denis Urubko established camp IV at 7,650 metres (25,100 ft) above sea level. The final ascent started by Kaczkan and Urubko failed due to the destruction of the tent by harsh weather in camp IV and Kaczkan's cerebral edema.[81]\n* 2011/2012 — Russian expedition. Nine Russian climbers attempted K2's Abruzzi Spur route. They managed to reach 7,200 metres (23,600 ft) above sea level (Vitaly Gorelik, Valery Shamalo and Nicholas Totmyanin), but had to retreat due to hurricane-force winds as well as frostbite on both of Gorelik's hands. After their descent to base camp and an unsuccessful call for Gorelik's evacuation (helicopter could not reach them through the worsening weather), the climber died of pneumonia and cardiac arrest. Following the incident, the expedition was called off.[81][82]\n* 2017/2018 — Polish National Winter Expedition led by Krzysztof Wielicki, consisting of 13 climbers, started in the end of December 2017. The team initially attempted to summit via the south-southeastern spur (Cesen route), switching to the Abruzzi Spur after an injury on the previous route.[83][84][85][86] Via the Cesen/Basque route they reached up to 6,300 metres (20,700 ft), while on the Abruzzi Spur route they reached up to 7,400 metres (24,300 ft). However, Denis Urubko reported that during his solo attempt he probably reached up to 7,600 metres (24,900 ft).[87]\n* 2021 — Ten climbers from an international expedition made the first winter summit on 16 January 2021. The group all summited together, and consisted of Mingma Gyalje Sherpa, Nirmal Purja, Gelje Sherpa, Mingma David Sherpa, Mingma Tenzi Sherpa, Dawa Temba Sherpa, Pem Chhiri Sherpa, Kilu Pemba Sherpa, Dawa Tenjing Sherpa, and Sona Sherpa. The summiting group consisted entirely of indigenous climbers from Nepal. Nirmal Purja was the only one who reached the summit without the use of supplemental oxygen. The summit temperature was −40 °C (−40 °F). On the same day Spanish team member Sergi Mingote died on the descent from Camp III; he fell somewhere between Camp I and Advanced Base Camp.[16][15][88][89][90][91][92][93][94] Other famous climbers who died on the same expedition include Atanas Skatov,[95][96][97] Ali Sadpara, John Snorri, and Juan Pablo Mohr Prieto.[98][99]\n\n\n## Climbing routes and difficulties[edit]\n\n\nThere are a number of routes on K2, of somewhat different character, but they all share some key difficulties, the first being the extremely high altitude and resulting lack of oxygen: there is only one-third as much oxygen available to a climber on the summit of K2 as there is at sea level.[100] The second is the propensity of the mountain to experience extreme storms of several days duration, which have resulted in many of the deaths on the peak. The third is the steep, exposed, and committing nature of all routes on the mountain, which makes retreat more difficult, especially during a storm. Despite many attempts the first successful winter ascents occurred only in 2021. All major climbing routes lie on the Pakistani side.[*citation needed*] The base camp is also located on the Pakistani side.[101]\n\n\n\n### Abruzzi Spur[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The south side of K2 with the Abruzzi Spur route\nThe standard route of ascent, used by 75% of all climbers, is the Abruzzi Spur,[102][103] located on the Pakistani side, first attempted by Prince Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi in 1909. This is the peak's southeast ridge, rising above the Godwin-Austen Glacier. The spur proper begins at an altitude of 5,400 metres (17,700 ft), where Advanced Base Camp is usually placed. The route follows an alternating series of rock ribs, snow/ice fields, and some technical rock climbing on two famous features, \"House's Chimney\" and the \"Black Pyramid.\" Above the Black Pyramid, dangerously exposed and difficult-to-navigate slopes lead to the easily visible \"Shoulder\", and thence to the summit. The last major obstacle is a narrow couloir known as the \"Bottleneck\", which places climbers dangerously close to a wall of seracs that form an ice cliff to the east of the summit. It was partly due to the collapse of one of these seracs around 2001 that no climbers reached the summit in 2002 and 2003.[104]\n\n\nBetween 1 - 2 August 2008, 11 climbers from several expeditions died during a series of accidents, including several ice falls in the Bottleneck.[62][105]\n\n\n\n### North Ridge[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The north side of K2. The North Ridge is in the centre of the picture.\nAlmost opposite the Abruzzi Spur is the North Ridge,[102][103] which ascends the Chinese side of the peak. It is rarely climbed, partly due to very difficult access, involving crossing the Shaksgam River, which is a hazardous undertaking.[106] In contrast to the crowds of climbers and trekkers at the Abruzzi basecamp, usually at most two teams are encamped below the North Ridge. This route, more technically difficult than the Abruzzi,[*citation needed*] ascends a long, steep, primarily rock ridge to high on the mountain—Camp IV, the \"Eagle's Nest\" at 7,900 metres (25,900 ft)—and then crosses a dangerously slide-prone hanging glacier by a leftward climbing traverse, to reach a snow couloir which accesses the summit.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nBesides the original Japanese ascent, a notable ascent of the North Ridge was the one in 1990 by Greg Child, Greg Mortimer, and Steve Swenson, which was done alpine style above Camp 2, though using some fixed ropes already put in place by a Japanese team.[106]\n\n\n\n### Other routes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The routes climbed on the Northwest of the mountain. A: West Ridge; B: West Face; C: Northwest Ridge; D: North Ridge; E: Northeast Ridge.\nBecause 75% of people who climb K2 use the Abruzzi Spur, these listed routes are rarely climbed. No one has climbed the East Face of the mountain due to the instability of the snow and ice formations on that side.[107] Besides the East Face, the North Face has not yet been climbed either. In 2007 Denis Urubko and Serguey Samoilov intended to climb the K2's North Face but they were stymied by increasingly deteriorating conditions. After finding their intended route menaced by growing avalanche danger, they traversed onto the normal North Ridge route and summited on 2 October 2007, making the latest summer season ascent of the peak in history.[108]\n\n\n\nNortheast Ridge\nLong and corniced, finishes on uppermost part of Abruzzi route. Ridge first crossed by a Polish expedition led by Janusz Kurczab in 1976. The team was not able to summit due to poor weather.[109] First climbed by Louis Reichardt and James Wickwire on 6 September 1978.[110]\nWest Ridge\nFirst climbed in 1981 by a Japanese team.[111] This route starts on the distant Negrotto Glacier and goes through unpredictable bands of rock and snowfields.[*citation needed*]\nSouthwest Pillar or \"Magic Line\"\nVery technical, and the second most demanding. First climbed in 1986 by the Polish-Slovak trio Piasecki-Wróż-Božik. Since then Jordi Corominas from Spain has been the only successful climber on this route (he summited in 2004),[112] despite many other attempts.[*citation needed*]\nSouth Face or \"Polish Line\" or \"Central Rib\"\nExtremely exposed, demanding, and dangerous. In July 1986, Jerzy Kukuczka and Tadeusz Piotrowski summited on this route. Piotrowski was killed while descending on the Abruzzi Spur. The route starts off the first part of the Southwest Pillar, and then deviates into a totally exposed, snow-covered cliff area, then through a gully known as \"The Hockey Stick\", and then goes up to yet another exposed cliff-face, and the route continues through yet another extremely exposed section all the way up to the point where the route joins with the Abruzzi Spur about 300 m (1,000 ft) before the summit. Reinhold Messner called it a suicidal route and so far, no one has repeated Kukuczka and Piotrowski's achievement. \"The route is so avalanche-prone, that no one else has ever considered a new attempt.\"[113][114]\nNorthwest Face\nFirst ascent via this route was in 1990 by a Japanese team; this route is located on the Chinese side of the mountain. This route is known for its chaotic rock and snowfields all the way up to the summit.[112]\nNorthwest Ridge\nFirst climbed in 1991 by a French team: Pierre Beghin and Christophe Profit. Finishes on North Ridge. The second attempt in 1995 by an American team, they reached 8100 metres the 2 August before turning back in deteriorating weather.[115]\nSouth-southeast spur or \"Cesen route\" or \"Basque route\"\nIt runs the pillar between the Abruzzi Spur and the Polish Route. It connects with the Abruzzi Spur on the Shoulder, above the Black Pyramid and below the Bottleneck; since it avoids the Black Pyramid, it is considered safer. In 1986, Tomo Česen ascended to 8,000 m (26,000 ft) via this route. The first summit via this route was by a Basque team in 1994.[112]\nWest Face\nTechnical difficulty at high altitude, first climbed by a Russian team in 2007.[116] This route is almost entirely made up of rock crevasses and snow-covered couloirs.[112]\n### Use of supplemental oxygen[edit]\n\n\nFor most of its climbing history, K2 was not usually climbed with supplemental oxygen, and small, relatively lightweight teams were the norm.[102][103] However, the 2004 season saw a great increase in the use of oxygen: 28 of 47 summiteers used oxygen in that year.[104]\n\n\nAcclimatisation is essential when climbing without oxygen to avoid some degree of altitude sickness.[117]\nK2's summit is well above the altitude at which high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE), or high altitude cerebral edema (HACE) can occur.[118] In mountaineering, when ascending above an altitude of 8,000 metres (26,000 ft), the climber enters what is known as the *death zone*.[119]\n\n\n\n## Films[edit]\n\n\n* *K2* (1991), an adventure drama film adaption of Patrick Meyers' original stage play, directed by Franc Roddam and loosely based on the story of Jim Wickwire and Louis Reichardt, the first Americans to summit K2\n* *Vertical Limit* (2000), an American survival thriller film directed by Martin Campbell\n* *K2: Siren of the Himalayas* (2012), an American documentary film directed by Dave Ohlson, that follows a group of climbers during their 2009 attempt to summit K2 on the 100-year anniversary of the Duke of Abruzzi’s landmark K2 expedition in 1909\n* *The Summit* (2012), a documentary film about the 2008 K2 disaster, directed by Nick Ryan\n* *K2: The Impossible Descent* (2020), a documentary film about Polish ski mountaineer Andrzej Bargiel's 2018 K2 climb and descent on skis, directed by Sławomir Batyra and Steven Robillard\n\n\n## Disasters[edit]\n\n\n* 1986 K2 disaster\n* 1995 K2 disaster\n* 2008 K2 disaster\n\n\n## Passes[edit]\n\n\n**Windy Gap** is a 6,111-meter (20,049 ft)-high mountain pass 35°52′23″N 76°34′37″E﻿ / ﻿35.87318°N 76.57692°E﻿ / 35.87318; 76.57692 at east of K2, north of Broad Peak, and south of Skyang Kangri.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of books about K2\n* Concordia\n* Gilgit–Baltistan\n* The Himalayan Database\n* Kangchenjunga (3rd highest after Everest and K2)\n* List of deaths on eight-thousanders\n* List of highest mountains\n* List of Mount Everest death statistics\n* List of mountains in Pakistan\n* List of peaks by prominence\n* List of people who died climbing Mount Everest\n* List of tallest mountains in the Solar System\n* Mount Hood climbing accidents\n* Trans-Karakoram Tract\n\n* ![icon](image)Mountains portal\n* ![flag](image)Pakistan portal\n* ![flag](image)China portal\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b***  K2 is located in Gilgit–Baltistan, a region, which along with Azad Kashmir, forms Pakistan administered Kashmir.

As of February 2021[update], only 377 people have summited K2.[13] There have been 91 deaths during attempted climbs.\n\n\nMost ascents are made during July and August, typically the warmest times of the year.[14] But in January 2021, K2 became the final eight-thousander to be summited in the winter; the mountaineering feat was accomplished by a team of Nepalese climbers, led by Nirmal Purja and Mingma Gyalje Sherpa.[15][16]\n\n\nK2 has now been climbed by almost all of its ridges, but unlike other eight-thousanders, never from its eastern face.[17]\n\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Montgomerie's original sketch from 1856 in which he applied the notation *K2*\nThe name *K2* is derived from the notation used by the Great Trigonometrical Survey of British India. Thomas Montgomerie made the first survey of the Karakoram from Mount Haramukh, some 210 km (130 mi) to the south, and sketched the two most prominent peaks, labelling them *K1* and *K2*, where the *K* stands for *Karakoram*.[18]\n\n\nThe policy of the Great Trigonometrical Survey was to use local names for mountains wherever possible[b] and K1 was found to be known locally as Masherbrum. K2, however, appeared not to have acquired a local name, possibly due to its remoteness. The mountain is not visible from Askole, one of the highest settlements on the way to the mountain, nor from the nearest habitation to the north. K2 is only fleetingly glimpsed from the end of the Baltoro Glacier, beyond which few local people would have ventured.[19] The name *Chogori*, derived from two Balti words, *chhogo* ཆོ་གྷའོ་ (\"big\") and *ri* རི (\"mountain\") (چھوغوری)[20] has been suggested as a local name,[21] but evidence for its widespread use is scant. It may have been a compound name invented by Western explorers[22] or simply a bemused reply to the question \"What's that called?\"[19] It does, however, form the basis for the name *Qogir* (simplified Chinese: 乔戈里峰; traditional Chinese: 喬戈里峰; pinyin: *Qiáogēlǐ Fēng*) by which Chinese authorities officially refer to the peak. Other local names have been suggested including *Lamba Pahar* (\"Tall Mountain\" in Urdu) and *Dapsang*, but these are not widely used.[19]\n\n\nWith the mountain lacking a local name, the name *Mount Godwin-Austen* was suggested, in honour of Henry Godwin-Austen, an early explorer of the area. While the name was rejected by the Royal Geographical Society,[19] it was used on several maps and continues to be used occasionally.[23][24]\n\n\nThe surveyor's mark, K2, therefore continues to be the name by which the mountain is commonly known. It is now also used in the Balti language, rendered as *Kechu* or *Ketu*[22][25] (Balti: کے چو Urdu: کے ٹو). The Italian climber Fosco Maraini argued in his account of the ascent of Gasherbrum IV that while the name of K2 owes its origin to chance, its clipped, impersonal nature is highly appropriate for so remote and challenging a mountain. He concluded that it was:\n\n\n\n\n> ... just the bare bones of a name, all rock and ice and storm and abyss. It makes no attempt to sound human. It is atoms and stars. It has the nakedness of the world before the first man—or of the cindered planet after the last.[26]\n> \n> \n\n\nAndré Weil named K3 surfaces in mathematics partly after the beauty of the mountain K2.[27]\n\n\n\n## Geographical setting[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map including K2 (labelled as *K2 (MOUNT GODWIN AUSTEN)* in upper left corner of map) (AMS, 1953)\nVirtual flight around K2\nK2 lies in the northwestern Karakoram Range. It is located in the Baltistan region of Gilgit–Baltistan, Pakistan, and the Taxkorgan Tajik Autonomous County of Xinjiang, China.[a] The Tarim sedimentary basin borders the range on the north and the Lesser Himalayas on the south. Melt waters from glaciers, such as those south and east of K2, feed agriculture in the valleys and contribute significantly to the regional fresh-water supply.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nK2 is ranked 22nd by topographic prominence, a measure of a mountain's independent stature. It is a part of the same extended area of uplift (including the Karakoram, the Tibetan Plateau, and the Himalayas) as Mount Everest, and it is possible to follow a path from K2 to Everest that goes no lower than 4,594 metres (15,072 ft), at the Kora La on the Nepal/China border in the Mustang Lo. Many other peaks far lower than K2 are more independent in this sense. It is, however, the most prominent peak within the Karakoram range.[2]\n\n\nK2 is notable for its local relief as well as its total height. It stands over 3,000 metres (9,840 ft) above much of the glacial valley bottoms at its base. It is a consistently steep pyramid, dropping quickly in almost all directions. The north side is the steepest: there it rises over 3,200 metres (10,500 ft) above the K2 (Qogir) Glacier in only 3,000 metres (9,800 ft) of horizontal distance. In most directions, it achieves over 2,800 metres (9,200 ft) of vertical relief in less than 4,000 metres (13,000 ft).[28]\n\n\nA 1986 expedition led by George Wallerstein made an inaccurate measurement showing that K2 was taller than Mount Everest, and therefore the tallest mountain in the world.[29] A corrected measurement was made in 1987, but by then the claim that K2 was the tallest mountain in the world had already made it into many news reports and reference works.[30]\n\n\n\n## Height[edit]\n\n\nK2's height given on maps and encyclopedias is 8,611 metres (28,251 ft). In the summer of 2014, a Pakistani-Italian expedition to K2, named \"K2 60 Years Later\", was organized to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the first ascent of K2. One of the goals of the expedition was to accurately measure the height of the mountain using satellite navigation. The height of K2 measured during this expedition was 8,609.02 metres (28,244.8 ft).[31][32]\n\n\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\nThe mountains of K2 and Broad Peak, and the area westward to the lower reaches of Sarpo Laggo glacier, consist of metamorphic rocks, known as the *K2 Gneiss,* and part of the Karakoram Metamorphic Complex.[33][34] The K2 Gneiss consists of a mixture of orthogneiss and biotite-rich paragneiss. On the south and southeast face of K2, the orthogneiss consists of a mixture of a strongly foliated plagioclase-hornblende gneiss and a biotite-hornblende-K-feldspar orthogneiss, which has been intruded by garnet-mica leucogranitic dikes. In places, the paragneisses include clinopyroxene-hornblende-bearing psammites, garnet (grossular)-diopside marbles, and biotite-graphite phyllites. Near the memorial to the climbers who have died on K2, above Base Camp on the south spur, thin impure marbles with quartzites and mica schists, called the *Gilkey-Puchoz sequence*, are interbanded within the orthogneisses. On the west face of Broad Peak and the south spur of K2, lamprophyre dikes, which consist of clinopyroxene and biotite-porphyritic vogesites and minettes, have intruded the K2 gneiss. The K2 Gneiss is separated from the surrounding sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks of the surrounding Karakoram Metamorphic Complex by normal faults. For example, a fault separates the K2 gneiss of the east face of K2 from limestones and slates comprising nearby Skyang Kangri.[33][35]\n\n\n40Ar/39Ar ages of 115 to 120 million years ago obtained from and geochemical analyses of the K2 Gneiss demonstrate that it is a metamorphosed, older, Cretaceous, pre-collisional granite. The granitic precursor (protolith) to the K2 Gneiss originated as the result of the production of large bodies of magma by a northward-dipping subduction zone along what was the continental margin of Asia at that time and their intrusion as batholiths into its lower continental crust. During the initial collision of the Asia and Indian plates, this granitic batholith was buried to depths of about 20 kilometres (12 mi) or more, highly metamorphosed, highly deformed, and partially remelted during the Eocene Period to form gneiss. Later, the K2 Gneiss was then intruded by leucogranite dikes and finally exhumed and uplifted along major breakback thrust faults during post-Miocene time. The K2 Gneiss was exposed as the entire K2-Broad Peak-Gasherbrum range experienced rapid uplift with which erosion rates have been unable to keep pace.[33][36]\n\n\n\n## Climbing history[edit]\n\n\n### Early attempts[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The west face of K2 taken from the Savoia Glacier, on the 1909 expedition\nThe mountain was first surveyed by a British team in 1856. Team member Thomas Montgomerie designated the mountain \"K2\" for being the second peak of the Karakoram range. The other peaks were originally named K1, K3, K4, and K5, but were eventually renamed Masherbrum, Gasherbrum IV, Gasherbrum II, and Gasherbrum I, respectively.[37] In 1892, Martin Conway led a British expedition that reached \"Concordia\" on the Baltoro Glacier.[38]\n\n\nThe first serious attempt to climb K2 was undertaken in 1902 by Oscar Eckenstein, Aleister Crowley, Jules Jacot-Guillarmod, Heinrich Pfannl, Victor Wessely, and Guy Knowles via the Northeast Ridge. In the early 1900s, modern transportation did not exist in the region: it took \"fourteen days just to reach the foot of the mountain\".[39]\nAfter five serious and costly attempts, the team reached 6,525 metres (21,407 ft)[40]—although considering the difficulty of the challenge, and the lack of modern climbing equipment or weatherproof fabrics, Crowley's statement that \"neither man nor beast was injured\" highlights the relative skill of the ascent. The failures were also attributed to sickness (Crowley was suffering the residual effects of malaria), a combination of questionable physical training, personality conflicts, and poor weather conditions—of 68 days spent on K2 (at the time, the record for the longest time spent at such an altitude) only eight provided clear weather.[41]\n\n\nThe next expedition to K2, in 1909, led by Prince Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi, reached an elevation of around 6,250 metres (20,510 ft) on the South East Spur, now known as the *Abruzzi Spur* (or Abruzzi Ridge). This would eventually become part of the standard route, but was abandoned at the time due to its steepness and difficulty. After trying and failing to find a feasible alternative route on the West Ridge or the North East Ridge, the Duke declared that K2 would never be climbed, and the team switched its attention to Chogolisa, where the Duke came within 150 metres (490 ft) of the summit before being driven back by a storm.[42]\n\n\n\n![](image)K2 from the east, photographed during the 1909 expedition\nThe next attempt on K2 was not made until 1938, when the First American Karakoram expedition led by Charles Houston made a reconnaissance of the mountain. They concluded that the Abruzzi Spur was the most practical route and reached a height of around 8,000 meters (26,000 ft) before turning back due to diminishing supplies and the threat of bad weather.[43][44]\n\n\nThe following year, the 1939 American expedition led by Fritz Wiessner came within 200 metres (660 ft) of the summit but ended in disaster when Dudley Wolfe, Pasang Kikuli, Pasang Kitar, and Pintso disappeared high on the mountain.[45][46]\n\n\nCharles Houston returned to K2 to lead the 1953 American expedition. The attempt failed after a storm pinned down the team for 10 days at 7,800 metres (25,590 ft), during which time climber Art Gilkey became critically ill. A desperate retreat followed, during which Pete Schoening saved almost the entire team during a mass fall (known simply as The Belay), and Gilkey was killed, either in an avalanche or in a deliberate attempt to avoid burdening his companions. Despite the retreat and tragic end, the expedition has been given iconic status in mountaineering history.[47][48][49] The Gilkey Memorial was built in his memory at the mountain's foot.[50]\n\n\n\n### Success and repeats[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Achille Compagnoni on K2's summit on the first ascent (31 July 1954)\nThe 1954 Italian expedition finally succeeded in ascending to the summit of K2 via the Abruzzi Spur on 31 July 1954. The expedition was led by Ardito Desio, and the two climbers who reached the summit were Lino Lacedelli and Achille Compagnoni. The team included a Pakistani member, Colonel Muhammad Ata-ullah, who had been a part of the 1953 American expedition. Also on the expedition were Walter Bonatti and Pakistani Hunza porter Amir Mehdi, who both proved vital to the expedition's success in that they carried oxygen tanks to 8,100 metres (26,600 ft) for Lacedelli and Compagnoni. The ascent is controversial because Lacedelli and Compagnoni established their camp at a higher elevation than originally agreed with Mehdi and Bonatti. It being too dark to ascend or descend, Mehdi and Bonatti were forced to overnight without shelter above 8,000 metres (26,000 ft) leaving the oxygen tanks behind as requested when they descended. Bonatti and Mehdi survived, but Mehdi was hospitalised for months and had to have his toes amputated because of frostbite. Efforts in the 1950s to suppress these facts to protect Lacedelli and Compagnoni's reputations as Italian national heroes were later brought to light. It was also revealed that the moving of the camp was deliberate, a move apparently made because Compagnoni feared being outshone by the younger Bonatti. Bonatti was given the blame for Mehdi's hospitalisation.[51]\n\n\nOn 9 August 1977, 23 years after the Italian expedition, Ichiro Yoshizawa led the second successful ascent, with Ashraf Aman as the first native Pakistani climber. The Japanese expedition took the Abruzzi Spur and used more than 1,500 porters.[52]\n\n\nThe third ascent of K2 was in 1978, via a new route, the long and corniced Northeast Ridge. The top of the route traversed left across the East Face to avoid a vertical headwall and joined the uppermost part of the Abruzzi route. This ascent was made by an American team, led by James Whittaker; the summit party was Louis Reichardt, Jim Wickwire, John Roskelley, and Rick Ridgeway. Wickwire endured an overnight bivouac about 150 metres (490 ft) below the summit, one of the highest bivouacs in history. This ascent was emotional for the American team, as they saw themselves as completing a task that had been begun by the 1938 team forty years earlier.[53]\n\n\nAnother notable Japanese ascent was that of the difficult North Ridge on the Chinese side of the peak in 1982. A team from the Japan Mountaineering Association [ja] led by Isao Shinkai and Masatsugo Konishi [ja] put three members, Naoe Sakashita, Hiroshi Yoshino, and Yukihiro Yanagisawa, on the summit on 14 August. However Yanagisawa fell and died on the descent. Four other members of the team achieved the summit the next day.[54]\n\n\nThe first climber to reach the summit of K2 twice was Czech climber Josef Rakoncaj. Rakoncaj was a member of the 1983 Italian expedition led by Francesco Santon, which made the second successful ascent of the North Ridge (31 July 1983). Three years later, on 5 July 1986, he reached the summit via the Abruzzi Spur (double with Broad Peak West Face solo) as a member of Agostino da Polenza's international expedition.[55]\n\n\nThe first woman to summit K2 was Polish climber Wanda Rutkiewicz on 23 June 1986. Liliane and Maurice Barrard who had summited later that day, fell during the descent; Liliane Barrard's body was found on 19 July 1986 at the foot of the south face.[56]\n\n\nIn 1986, two Polish expeditions summited via two new routes, the Magic Line[57] and the Polish Line (Jerzy Kukuczka and Tadeusz Piotrowski). Piotrowski fell to his death as the two were descending. \n\n\nThirteen climbers from several expeditions died in the 1986 K2 disaster. Another six mountaineers died in the 1995 K2 disaster, while eleven climbers died in the 2008 K2 disaster.[58][59][*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Recent attempts[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of deaths on eight-thousanders § K2\n\n2004\nIn 2004, the Spanish climber Carlos Soria Fontán became the oldest person ever to summit K2, at the age of 65.[60]\n2008\nOn 1 August 2008, a group of climbers went missing after a large piece of ice fell during an avalanche, taking out the fixed ropes on part of the route; four climbers were rescued, but 11, including Meherban Karim from Pakistan[61] and Ger McDonnell, the first Irish person to reach the summit, were confirmed dead.[62]\n2009\nDespite several attempts, nobody reached the summit.[*citation needed*]\n2010\nOn 6 August 2010, Fredrik Ericsson, who intended to ski from the summit, joined Gerlinde Kaltenbrunner on the way to the summit of K2. Ericsson fell 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) and was killed. Kaltenbrunner aborted her summit attempt.[63]\nDespite several attempts, nobody reached the summit.[*citation needed*]\n2011\nOn 23 August 2011, a team of four climbers reached the summit of K2 from the North side. Gerlinde Kaltenbrunner became the first woman to complete all 14 eight-thousanders without supplemental oxygen.[64] Kazakhs Maxut Zhumayev and Vassiliy Pivtsov completed their eight-thousanders quest. The fourth team member was Dariusz Załuski from Poland.[65]\n2012\nThe year started with a Russian team aiming for a first winter ascent. The expedition ended with the death of Vitaly Gorelik due to frostbite and pneumonia. The Russian team cancelled the ascent.[66] In the summer season, K2 saw a record crowd standing on its summit—28 climbers in a single day—bringing the total for the year to 30.[67]\n2013\nOn 28 July 2013, two New Zealanders, Marty Schmidt and his son Denali, died after an avalanche destroyed their camp. A guide had reached their camp, but said they were nowhere to be seen and the campsite tent showed signs of having been hit by an avalanche. British climber Adrian Hayes, who was with the group, later posted on his Facebook page that the campsite had been wiped out.[68]\n2014\nOn 26 July 2014, the first team of Pakistani climbers scaled K2. There were six Pakistani and three Italian climbers in the expedition, called K2 60 Years Later, according to BBC. Previously, K2 had only been summited by individual Pakistanis as part of international expeditions.[69] Another team, consisting of Pasang Lhamu Sherpa Akita, Maya Sherpa, and Dawa Yangzum Sherpa, became the first Nepali women to climb K2.[70]\nOn 27 July 2014, Garrett Madison led a team of three American climbers and six Sherpas to summit K2.[71][72]\nOn 31 July 2014, Boyan Petrov completed the first Bulgarian ascent, just 8 days after climbing Broad Peak. Boyan is among the very few climbers with diabetes to climb above 7,000 metres (23,000 ft) without the use of supplemental oxygen.[73]\n2017\nOn 28 July 2017, Vanessa O'Brien led an international team of 12 with Mingma Gyalje Sherpa of Dreamers Destination to the summit of K2 and became the first British and American woman to summit K2, and the eldest woman to summit K2 at the age of 52 years old.[74] She paid tribute to Julie Tullis and Alison Hargreaves, two British women who summited K2, in 1986 and 1995 respectively, but died during their descents. Other notable summits included John Snorri Sigurjónsson and Dawa Gyalje Sherpa who joined his sister (Dawa Yangzum Sherpa), becoming the second set of siblings to summit K2.[75] Both Mingma Gyalje Sherpa and Fazal Ali recorded their second K2 summits.[*citation needed*]\n2018\nOn 22 July 2018, Garrett Madison became the first American climber to reach the summit of K2 more than once when he led an international team of eight climbers, nine Nepali Sherpas, four Pakistani high-altitude porters, and two other Madison Mountaineering guides to the summit.[76][77]\nOn 22 July 2018, Polish mountaineer and mountain runner Andrzej Bargiel became the first person to ski down from summit to base camp.[78]\n2019\nOn 25 July 2019, Anja Blacha became the first German woman to summit K2. She climbed without the use of supplemental oxygen.[79]\n2022\nOn 22 July 2022 more than 100 summits on K2 in a single day were recorded. This is the highest number of summits in a single day ever on K2.[80]\n### Winter expeditions[edit]\n\n\n* 1987/1988 — Polish-Canadian-British expedition led by Andrzej Zawada from the Pakistani side, consisting of 13 Poles, 7 Canadians and 4 Brits. 2 March Krzysztof Wielicki and Leszek Cichy established camp III at 7,300 metres (24,000 ft) above sea, followed by Roger Mear and Jean-Francois Gagnon few days later. Hurricane winds and frostbite forced the team to retreat.[81]\n* 2002/2003 — Netia K2 Polish Winter Expedition. The team of fourteen climbers was led by Krzysztof Wielicki, and included four members from Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Georgia. They intended to climb North Ridge. Marcin Kaczkan, Piotr Morawski and Denis Urubko established camp IV at 7,650 metres (25,100 ft) above sea level. The final ascent started by Kaczkan and Urubko failed due to the destruction of the tent by harsh weather in camp IV and Kaczkan's cerebral edema.[81]\n* 2011/2012 — Russian expedition. Nine Russian climbers attempted K2's Abruzzi Spur route. They managed to reach 7,200 metres (23,600 ft) above sea level (Vitaly Gorelik, Valery Shamalo and Nicholas Totmyanin), but had to retreat due to hurricane-force winds as well as frostbite on both of Gorelik's hands. After their descent to base camp and an unsuccessful call for Gorelik's evacuation (helicopter could not reach them through the worsening weather), the climber died of pneumonia and cardiac arrest. Following the incident, the expedition was called off.[81][82]\n* 2017/2018 — Polish National Winter Expedition led by Krzysztof Wielicki, consisting of 13 climbers, started in the end of December 2017. The team initially attempted to summit via the south-southeastern spur (Cesen route), switching to the Abruzzi Spur after an injury on the previous route.[83][84][85][86] Via the Cesen/Basque route they reached up to 6,300 metres (20,700 ft), while on the Abruzzi Spur route they reached up to 7,400 metres (24,300 ft). However, Denis Urubko reported that during his solo attempt he probably reached up to 7,600 metres (24,900 ft).[87]\n* 2021 — Ten climbers from an international expedition made the first winter summit on 16 January 2021. The group all summited together, and consisted of Mingma Gyalje Sherpa, Nirmal Purja, Gelje Sherpa, Mingma David Sherpa, Mingma Tenzi Sherpa, Dawa Temba Sherpa, Pem Chhiri Sherpa, Kilu Pemba Sherpa, Dawa Tenjing Sherpa, and Sona Sherpa. The summiting group consisted entirely of indigenous climbers from Nepal. Nirmal Purja was the only one who reached the summit without the use of supplemental oxygen. The summit temperature was −40 °C (−40 °F). On the same day Spanish team member Sergi Mingote died on the descent from Camp III; he fell somewhere between Camp I and Advanced Base Camp.[16][15][88][89][90][91][92][93][94] Other famous climbers who died on the same expedition include Atanas Skatov,[95][96][97] Ali Sadpara, John Snorri, and Juan Pablo Mohr Prieto.[98][99]\n\n\n## Climbing routes and difficulties[edit]\n\n\nThere are a number of routes on K2, of somewhat different character, but they all share some key difficulties, the first being the extremely high altitude and resulting lack of oxygen: there is only one-third as much oxygen available to a climber on the summit of K2 as there is at sea level.[100] The second is the propensity of the mountain to experience extreme storms of several days duration, which have resulted in many of the deaths on the peak. The third is the steep, exposed, and committing nature of all routes on the mountain, which makes retreat more difficult, especially during a storm. Despite many attempts the first successful winter ascents occurred only in 2021. All major climbing routes lie on the Pakistani side.[*citation needed*] The base camp is also located on the Pakistani side.[101]\n\n\n\n### Abruzzi Spur[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The south side of K2 with the Abruzzi Spur route\nThe standard route of ascent, used by 75% of all climbers, is the Abruzzi Spur,[102][103] located on the Pakistani side, first attempted by Prince Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi in 1909. This is the peak's southeast ridge, rising above the Godwin-Austen Glacier. The spur proper begins at an altitude of 5,400 metres (17,700 ft), where Advanced Base Camp is usually placed. The route follows an alternating series of rock ribs, snow/ice fields, and some technical rock climbing on two famous features, \"House's Chimney\" and the \"Black Pyramid.\" Above the Black Pyramid, dangerously exposed and difficult-to-navigate slopes lead to the easily visible \"Shoulder\", and thence to the summit. The last major obstacle is a narrow couloir known as the \"Bottleneck\", which places climbers dangerously close to a wall of seracs that form an ice cliff to the east of the summit. It was partly due to the collapse of one of these seracs around 2001 that no climbers reached the summit in 2002 and 2003.[104]\n\n\nBetween 1 - 2 August 2008, 11 climbers from several expeditions died during a series of accidents, including several ice falls in the Bottleneck.[62][105]\n\n\n\n### North Ridge[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The north side of K2. The North Ridge is in the centre of the picture.\nAlmost opposite the Abruzzi Spur is the North Ridge,[102][103] which ascends the Chinese side of the peak. It is rarely climbed, partly due to very difficult access, involving crossing the Shaksgam River, which is a hazardous undertaking.[106] In contrast to the crowds of climbers and trekkers at the Abruzzi basecamp, usually at most two teams are encamped below the North Ridge. This route, more technically difficult than the Abruzzi,[*citation needed*] ascends a long, steep, primarily rock ridge to high on the mountain—Camp IV, the \"Eagle's Nest\" at 7,900 metres (25,900 ft)—and then crosses a dangerously slide-prone hanging glacier by a leftward climbing traverse, to reach a snow couloir which accesses the summit.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nBesides the original Japanese ascent, a notable ascent of the North Ridge was the one in 1990 by Greg Child, Greg Mortimer, and Steve Swenson, which was done alpine style above Camp 2, though using some fixed ropes already put in place by a Japanese team.[106]\n\n\n\n### Other routes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The routes climbed on the Northwest of the mountain. A: West Ridge; B: West Face; C: Northwest Ridge; D: North Ridge; E: Northeast Ridge.\nBecause 75% of people who climb K2 use the Abruzzi Spur, these listed routes are rarely climbed. No one has climbed the East Face of the mountain due to the instability of the snow and ice formations on that side.[107] Besides the East Face, the North Face has not yet been climbed either. In 2007 Denis Urubko and Serguey Samoilov intended to climb the K2's North Face but they were stymied by increasingly deteriorating conditions. After finding their intended route menaced by growing avalanche danger, they traversed onto the normal North Ridge route and summited on 2 October 2007, making the latest summer season ascent of the peak in history.[108]\n\n\n\nNortheast Ridge\nLong and corniced, finishes on uppermost part of Abruzzi route. Ridge first crossed by a Polish expedition led by Janusz Kurczab in 1976. The team was not able to summit due to poor weather.[109] First climbed by Louis Reichardt and James Wickwire on 6 September 1978.[110]\nWest Ridge\nFirst climbed in 1981 by a Japanese team.[111] This route starts on the distant Negrotto Glacier and goes through unpredictable bands of rock and snowfields.[*citation needed*]\nSouthwest Pillar or \"Magic Line\"\nVery technical, and the second most demanding. First climbed in 1986 by the Polish-Slovak trio Piasecki-Wróż-Božik. Since then Jordi Corominas from Spain has been the only successful climber on this route (he summited in 2004),[112] despite many other attempts.[*citation needed*]\nSouth Face or \"Polish Line\" or \"Central Rib\"\nExtremely exposed, demanding, and dangerous. In July 1986, Jerzy Kukuczka and Tadeusz Piotrowski summited on this route. Piotrowski was killed while descending on the Abruzzi Spur. The route starts off the first part of the Southwest Pillar, and then deviates into a totally exposed, snow-covered cliff area, then through a gully known as \"The Hockey Stick\", and then goes up to yet another exposed cliff-face, and the route continues through yet another extremely exposed section all the way up to the point where the route joins with the Abruzzi Spur about 300 m (1,000 ft) before the summit. Reinhold Messner called it a suicidal route and so far, no one has repeated Kukuczka and Piotrowski's achievement. \"The route is so avalanche-prone, that no one else has ever considered a new attempt.\"[113][114]\nNorthwest Face\nFirst ascent via this route was in 1990 by a Japanese team; this route is located on the Chinese side of the mountain. This route is known for its chaotic rock and snowfields all the way up to the summit.[112]\nNorthwest Ridge\nFirst climbed in 1991 by a French team: Pierre Beghin and Christophe Profit. Finishes on North Ridge. The second attempt in 1995 by an American team, they reached 8100 metres the 2 August before turning back in deteriorating weather.[115]\nSouth-southeast spur or \"Cesen route\" or \"Basque route\"\nIt runs the pillar between the Abruzzi Spur and the Polish Route. It connects with the Abruzzi Spur on the Shoulder, above the Black Pyramid and below the Bottleneck; since it avoids the Black Pyramid, it is considered safer. In 1986, Tomo Česen ascended to 8,000 m (26,000 ft) via this route. The first summit via this route was by a Basque team in 1994.[112]\nWest Face\nTechnical difficulty at high altitude, first climbed by a Russian team in 2007.[116] This route is almost entirely made up of rock crevasses and snow-covered couloirs.[112]\n### Use of supplemental oxygen[edit]\n\n\nFor most of its climbing history, K2 was not usually climbed with supplemental oxygen, and small, relatively lightweight teams were the norm.[102][103] However, the 2004 season saw a great increase in the use of oxygen: 28 of 47 summiteers used oxygen in that year.[104]\n\n\nAcclimatisation is essential when climbing without oxygen to avoid some degree of altitude sickness.[117]\nK2's summit is well above the altitude at which high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE), or high altitude cerebral edema (HACE) can occur.[118] In mountaineering, when ascending above an altitude of 8,000 metres (26,000 ft), the climber enters what is known as the *death zone*.[119]\n\n\n\n## Films[edit]\n\n\n* *K2* (1991), an adventure drama film adaption of Patrick Meyers' original stage play, directed by Franc Roddam and loosely based on the story of Jim Wickwire and Louis Reichardt, the first Americans to summit K2\n* *Vertical Limit* (2000), an American survival thriller film directed by Martin Campbell\n* *K2: Siren of the Himalayas* (2012), an American documentary film directed by Dave Ohlson, that follows a group of climbers during their 2009 attempt to summit K2 on the 100-year anniversary of the Duke of Abruzzi’s landmark K2 expedition in 1909\n* *The Summit* (2012), a documentary film about the 2008 K2 disaster, directed by Nick Ryan\n* *K2: The Impossible Descent* (2020), a documentary film about Polish ski mountaineer Andrzej Bargiel's 2018 K2 climb and descent on skis, directed by Sławomir Batyra and Steven Robillard\n\n\n## Disasters[edit]\n\n\n* 1986 K2 disaster\n* 1995 K2 disaster\n* 2008 K2 disaster\n\n\n## Passes[edit]\n\n\n**Windy Gap** is a 6,111-meter (20,049 ft)-high mountain pass 35°52′23″N 76°34′37″E﻿ / ﻿35.87318°N 76.57692°E﻿ / 35.87318; 76.57692 at east of K2, north of Broad Peak, and south of Skyang Kangri.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of books about K2\n* Concordia\n* Gilgit–Baltistan\n* The Himalayan Database\n* Kangchenjunga (3rd highest after Everest and K2)\n* List of deaths on eight-thousanders\n* List of highest mountains\n* List of Mount Everest death statistics\n* List of mountains in Pakistan\n* List of peaks by prominence\n* List of people who died climbing Mount Everest\n* List of tallest mountains in the Solar System\n* Mount Hood climbing accidents\n* Trans-Karakoram Tract\n\n* ![icon](image)Mountains portal\n* ![flag](image)Pakistan portal\n* ![flag](image)China portal\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b***  K2 is located in Gilgit–Baltistan, a region, which along with Azad Kashmir, forms Pakistan administered Kashmir.

Its summit lies at 8,586 m (28,169 ft) in a section of the Himalayas, the *Kangchenjunga Himal*, which is bounded in the west by the Tamur River, in the north by the Lhonak River and Jongsang La, and in the east by the Teesta River.[1][3] It lies in the border region between Nepal and Sikkim state of India, with three of the five peaks, namely Main, Central and South, directly on the border,[4] and the peaks West and Kangbachen in Nepal's Taplejung District.[5]\n\n\nUntil 1852, Kangchenjunga was assumed to be the highest mountain in the world, but calculations and measurements by the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India in 1849 showed that Mount Everest, known as Peak XV at the time, is actually higher. After allowing for further verification of all calculations, it was officially announced in 1856 that Kangchenjunga was the third-highest mountain.[6]\n\n\nThe Kangchenjunga is a sacred mountain in Nepal and Sikkim and was first climbed on 25 May 1955 by Joe Brown and George Band, who were part of the 1955 British Kangchenjunga expedition. They stopped just short of the true summit, keeping a promise given to Tashi Namgyal, the Chogyal of Sikkim, that the top of the mountain would remain inviolate.[7] The Indian side of the mountain is off-limits to climbers. In 2016, the adjoining Khangchendzonga National Park was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\n*Kangchenjunga* is the official spelling adopted by Douglas Freshfield, Alexander Mitchell Kellas and the Royal Geographical Society that gives the best indication of the Tibetan pronunciation. Freshfield referred to the spelling used by the Indian Government since the late 19th century.[3] Alternative spellings include Kanchenjunga, Khangchendzonga and Kangchendzönga.[8][9][10]\n\n\nThe brothers Hermann, Adolf and Robert Schlagintweit explained the local name 'Kanchinjínga' meaning “The five treasures of the high snow” as originating from the Tibetan word \"gangs\" pronounced [kaŋ] meaning snow, ice; \"chen\" pronounced [tɕen] meaning great; \"mzod\" meaning treasure; \"lnga\" meaning five.[11]\nLocal Lhopo people believe that the treasures are hidden but reveal themselves to the devout when the world is in peril; the treasures comprise salt, gold, turquoise and precious stones, sacred scriptures, invincible armor or ammunition, grain and medicine.[12]\n\n\n\n## Protected areas[edit]\n\n\nThe Kangchenjunga landscape is a complex of three distinct ecoregions: the eastern Himalayan broad-leaved and coniferous forests, the Eastern Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows and the Terai-Duar savanna and grasslands.[13]\nThe Kangchenjunga transboundary landscape is shared by Nepal, India, Bhutan and China, and comprises 14 protected areas with a total of 6,032 km2 (2,329 sq mi):[14]\n\n\n\n* Nepal: Kanchenjunga Conservation Area\n* Sikkim, India: Khangchendzonga National Park, Varsey Rhododendron Sanctuary, Fambong Lho Wildlife Sanctuary, Kyongnosla Alpine Sanctuary, Maenam Wildlife Sanctuary, Shingba Rhododendron Sanctuary and Pangolakha Wildlife Sanctuary\n* Darjeeling, India: Jore Pokhri Wildlife Sanctuary, Singalila National Park, Senchal Wildlife Sanctuary, Mahananda Wildlife Sanctuary and Neora Valley National Park\n* Bhutan: Torsa Strict Nature Reserve\n\n\nThese protected areas are habitats for many globally significant plant species such as rhododendrons and orchids and many endangered flagship species such as snow leopard (*Panthera uncia*), Asian black bear (*Ursus thibetanus*), red panda (*Ailurus fulgens*), white-bellied musk deer (*Moschus leucogaster*), blood pheasant (*Ithaginis cruentus*) and chestnut-breasted partridge (*Arborophila mandellii*).[14]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nPanorama of the Kangchenjunga massif from Tiger Hill, Darjeeling\n\nThe *Kangchenjunga Himal* section of the Himalayas lies both in Nepal and India and encompasses 16 peaks over 7,000 m (23,000 ft). In the north, it is limited by the Lhonak Chu, Goma Chu and Jongsang La, and in the east by the Teesta River. The western limit runs from the Jongsang La down the Gingsang and Kangchenjunga glaciers and the rivers of Ghunsa and Tamur.[1] Kanchenjunga rises about 20 km (12 mi) south of the general alignment of the Great Himalayan range about 125 km (78 mi) east-southeast of Mount Everest as the crow flies. South of the southern face of Kanchenjunga runs the 3,000–3,500-metre-high (9,800–11,500 ft) Singalila Ridge that separates Sikkim from Nepal and northern West Bengal.[15]\n\n\nKangchenjunga and its satellite peaks form a huge mountain massif.[16] The massif's five highest peaks are listed in the following table.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Name of peak\n | Height (m)\n | Height (ft)\n | Location\n | Prominence (m)\n | Prominence (ft)\n | Nearest Higher Neighbor\n | Location (political)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Kangchenjunga Main[2] | 8,586\n | 28,169\n | 27°42′11″N 88°08′52″E﻿ / ﻿27.70306°N 88.14778°E﻿ / 27.70306; 88.14778 | 3,922\n | 12,867\n | Mount Everest – South Summit\n | Mangan district, Sikkim, India / Taplejung, Koshi Province, Nepal\n |\n| Kangchenjunga West (Yalung Kang)[17] | 8,505\n | 27,904\n | 27°42′18″N 88°08′12″E﻿ / ﻿27.70500°N 88.13667°E﻿ / 27.70500; 88.13667 | 135\n | 443\n | Kangchenjunga\n | Taplejung, Koshi Province, Nepal\n |\n| Kangchenjunga Central[18] | 8,482\n | 27,828\n | 27°41′46″N 88°09′04″E﻿ / ﻿27.69611°N 88.15111°E﻿ / 27.69611; 88.15111 | 32\n | 105\n | Kangchenjunga South\n | Mangan district, Sikkim, India / Taplejung, Koshi Province, Nepal\n |\n| Kangchenjunga South[19] | 8,494\n | 27,867\n | 27°41′30″N 88°09′15″E﻿ / ﻿27.69167°N 88.15417°E﻿ / 27.69167; 88.15417 | 119\n | 390\n | Kangchenjunga\n | Mangan district, Sikkim, India / Taplejung, Koshi Province, Nepal\n |\n| Kangbachen[20] | 7,903\n | 25,928\n | 27°42′42″N 88°06′30″E﻿ / ﻿27.71167°N 88.10833°E﻿ / 27.71167; 88.10833 | 103\n | 337\n | Kangchenjunga West\n | Taplejung, Koshi Province, Nepal\n |\n\n\n![](image)Kangchenjunga map by Garwood, 1903[3]\n![](image)Southwest (Yalung) face of Kangchenjunga seen from Nepal\nThe main ridge of the massif runs from north-northeast to south-southwest and forms a watershed to several rivers.[16] Together with ridges running roughly from east to west they form a giant cross.[3] These ridges contain a host of peaks between 6,000 and 8,586 m (19,685 and 28,169 ft). The northern section includes Yalung Kang, Kangchenjunga Central and South, Kangbachen, Kirat Chuli and Gimmigela Chuli, and runs up to the Jongsang La. The eastern ridge in Sikkim includes Siniolchu. The southern section runs along the Nepal–Sikkim border and includes Kabru I to III.[1] This ridge extends southwards to the Singalila Ridge.[21] The western ridge culminates in the Kumbhakarna, also known as Jannu.[1]\n\n\nFour main glaciers radiate from the peak, pointing roughly to the northeast, southeast, northwest and southwest. The *Zemu* glacier in the northeast and the *Talung* glacier in the southeast drain to the Teesta River; the *Yalung* glacier in the southwest and the *Kangchen* glacier in the northwest drain to the Arun and Kosi rivers.[22]\nThe glaciers spread over the area above approximately 5,000 m (16,000 ft), and the glacialized area covers about 314 km2 (121 sq mi) in total.[23] There are 120 glaciers in the Kanchenjunga Himal, of which 17 are debris-covered. Between 1958 and 1992, more than half of 57 examined glaciers had retreated, possibly due to rising of air temperature.[24]\n\n\nKangchenjunga Main is the highest elevation of the Brahmaputra River basin, which forms part of the southeast Asian monsoon regime and is among the globally largest river basins.[25]\nKangchenjunga is one of six peaks above 8,000 m (26,000 ft) located in the basin of the Kosi River, which is among the largest tributaries of the Ganges.[26]\nThe Kangchenjunga massif forms also part of the Ganges Basin.[27]\n\n\nAlthough it is the third highest peak in the world, Kangchenjunga is only ranked 29th by topographic prominence, a measure of a mountain's independent stature. The key col for Kangchenjunga lies at a height of 4,664 metres (15,302 ft), along the watershed boundary between Arun and Brahmaputra rivers in Tibet.[28] It is, however, the fourth-most-prominent peak in the Himalayas, after Everest, and the western and eastern anchors of the Himalaya, Nanga Parbat and Namcha Barwa, respectively.[29]\n\n\n\n## Climbing routes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kanchenjunga-north from base camp in Nepal\nThere are four climbing routes to reach the summit of Kangchenjunga, three of which are in Nepal from the southwest, northwest, and northeast, and one from northeastern Sikkim in India. To date, the northeastern route from Sikkim has been successfully used only three times. The Indian government has banned expeditions to Kanchenjunga; therefore, this route has been closed since 2000.[30]\n\n\n\n## Climbing history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Painting of *Kanchinjínga* as seen from the Singalila Ridge by Hermann Schlagintweit, 1855[31]\n![](image)Sunset on Kangchenjunga, 1905[32]\n![](image)South face of Kangchenjunga seen from Goecha La, Sikkim at 4,940 m (16,210 ft)\n![](image)Kangchenjunga seen from Darjeeling War Memorial\n![](image)Kangchenjunga and surrounding peaks at sunset from ISS, December 2019\n### Early reconnaissances and attempts[edit]\n\n\n* Between April 1848 and February 1849, Joseph Dalton Hooker explored parts of northern Sikkim and eastern Nepal, mainly to collect plants and study the distribution of Himalayan flora. He was based in Darjeeling, and made repeated excursions in the river valleys and into the foothills of Kangchenjunga up to an altitude of 15,620 ft (4,760 m).[33]\n* In spring 1855, the German explorer Hermann Schlagintweit travelled to Darjeeling but was not allowed to proceed further north due to the Third Nepal–Tibet War. In May, he explored the Singalila Ridge up to the peak of Tonglo for a meteorological survey.[31]\n* In 1879, Sarat Chandra Das and Lama Ugyen-gyatso crossed into Tibet west of \"Kanchanjinga\" via eastern Nepal and the Tashilhunpo Monastery en route to Lhasa. They returned along the same route in 1881.[34]\n* In 1883, a party of William Woodman Graham together with two Swiss mountaineers climbed in the area of Kangchenjunga. They were the first who ascended Kabru within 30–40 ft (9.1–12.2 m) below the summit. They crossed the Kang La pass and climbed a peak of nearly 19,000 ft (5,800 m) from which they examined Jannu. They concluded it was too late in the year for an attempt and returned once again to Darjeeling.[35]\n* Between October 1885 and January 1886, Rinzin Namgyal surveyed the unexplored north and west sides of Kangchenjunga. He was the first native surveyor to map the circuit of Kangchenjunga and provided sketches of each side of the peak and the adjoining valleys. He also defined the frontiers of Nepal, Tibet and Sikkim in this area.[36]\n* In 1899, British mountaineer Douglas Freshfield set out with his party comprising the Italian photographer Vittorio Sella. They were the first mountaineers to examine the lower and upper ramparts, and the great western face of Kangchenjunga, rising from the Kangchenjunga Glacier.[3]\n* In 1905, a party headed by Aleister Crowley made the first attempt at climbing the mountain. Aleister Crowley had been part of the team attempting the 1902 ascent of K2. The team reached an estimated altitude of 6,500 m (21,300 ft) on the southwest side of the mountain before turning back. The exact height reached is somewhat unclear; Crowley stated that on 31 August, \"We were certainly over 21,000 ft (6,400 m) and possibly over 22,000 ft (6,700 m)\", when the team was forced to retreat to Camp 5 by the risk of avalanche. On 1 September, they evidently went further; some members of the team, Reymond, Pache and Salama, \"got over the bad patch\" that had forced them to return to Camp 5 the day before, and progressed \"out of sight and hearing\" before returning to Crowley and the men with packs, who could not cross the dangerous section unassisted with their burdens. It is not clear how far Reymond, Pache and Salama had ascended—but in summarizing, Crowley ventured \"We had reached a height of approximately 25,000 ft (7,600 m).\" Attempting a \"mutinous\" late-in-the-day descent from Camp 5 to Camp 3, climber Alexis Pache (who earlier that day had been one of three to ascend possibly higher than any before), and three local porters, were killed in an avalanche.[37] Despite the insistence of one of the men that \"the demon of Kangchenjunga was propitiated with the sacrifice\", Crowley decided the accident and its ramifications made it impossible to continue the expedition.[32]\n* In 1907, two Norwegians set about climbing *Jongri* via the Kabru glacier to the south, an approach apparently rejected by Graham's party. Progress was very slow, partly because of problems with supplies and porters, and presumably also lack of fitness and acclimatisation. However, from a high camp at about 22,600 ft (6,900 m) they were eventually able to reach a point 50 or 60 ft (15 or 18 m) below the summit before they were turned back by strong winds.[35]\n* In 1929, the German Paul Bauer led an expedition team that reached 7,400 m (24,300 ft) on the northeast spur before being turned back by a five-day storm.[38]\n* In May 1929, the American E. F. Farmer left Darjeeling with native porters, crossed the Kang La into Nepal and climbed up towards the *Talung Saddle*. When his porters refused to go any further, he climbed alone further upwards through drifting mists but did not return.[16]\n* In 1930, Günter Dyhrenfurth led an international expedition comprising the German Uli Wieland, Austrian Erwin Schneider and Englishman Frank Smythe who attempted to climb Kangchenjunga. They failed because of poor weather and snow conditions.[16]\n* In 1931, Paul Bauer led a second German expedition team who attempted the northeast spur before being turned back by bad weather, illnesses and deaths. The team, including Peter Aufschnaiter, retreated after climbing 300 m higher than the 1929 attempt.[38]\n* In 1954, John Kempe led a party comprising J. W. Tucker, S. R. Jackson, G. C. Lewis, T. H. Braham and medical officer D. S. Mathews. They explored the upper Yalung glacier with the intention to discover a practicable route to the great ice-shelf that runs across the southwest face of Kangchenjunga.[39] This reconnaissance led to the route used by the successful 1955 expedition.[40]\n\n\n### First ascent[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1955 British Kangchenjunga expedition\n\n![](image)A sign board on the last traversable road to Kangchenjunga\n![](image)First ascent reunion of 1990– front (left to right): Neil Mather, John Angelo Jackson, Charles Evans and Joe Brown, and rear (left to right): Tony Streather, Norman Hardie, George Band and Professor John Clegg\nIn 1955, Joe Brown and George Band made the first ascent on 25 May, followed by Norman Hardie and Tony Streather on 26 May. The full team also included John Clegg (team doctor), Charles Evans (team leader), John Angelo Jackson, Neil Mather and Tom Mackinnon.[8]\nThe ascent proved that Aleister Crowley's 1905 route (also investigated by the 1954 reconnaissance) was viable. The route starts on the Yalung Glacier to the southwest of the peak, and climbs the Yalung Face, which is 3,000 metres (10,000 ft) high. The main feature of this face is the \"Great Shelf\", a large sloping plateau at around 7,500 metres (24,600 ft), covered by a hanging glacier. The route is almost entirely on snow, glacier and one icefall; the summit ridge itself can involve a small amount of travel on rock. The first ascent expedition made six camps above their base camp, two below the Shelf, two on it, and two above it. They started on 18 April, and everyone was back to base camp by 28 May.[41] Other members of this expedition included John Angelo Jackson and Tom Mackinnon.[42]\n\n\n\n### Other notable ascents[edit]\n\n\nKangchenjunga 3D animation\n* 1973 Yutaka Ageta and Takeo Matsuda of the Japanese expedition summited Kangchenjunga West, also called Yalung Kang, by climbing the southwestern ridge. Matsuda never returned to camp and his body was never found. The expedition concluded that he had fallen during descent when he was separated from Ageta.[43]\n* 1977 The second ascent of Kangchenjunga, by an Indian Army team led by Colonel Narendra Kumar. They completed the northeast spur, the difficult ridge that defeated German expeditions in 1929 and 1931.[44]\n* 1978 Polish teams made the first successful ascents of the summits Kangchenjunga South (Wojciech Wróż and Eugeniusz Chrobak, 19 May) and Kangchenjunga Central (Wojciech Brański, Zygmunt Andrzej Heinrich, Kazimierz Olech, 22 May).[45]\n* 1979 The third ascent, on 16 May, and the first without oxygen, by Doug Scott, Peter Boardman and Joe Tasker, establishing a new route on the North Ridge.[46]\n* 1992 Carlos Carsolio made the only summit that year. It was in a solo climb without supplementary oxygen.[47]\n* 1995 Benoît Chamoux, Pierre Royer and their Sherpa guide Riku disappeared on 6 October near the summit.[48]\n* 1998 Ginette Harrison was the first woman to climb Kangchenjunga's North Face.[49]\n* 2009 Edurne Pasaban, a Spanish mountaineer, reached the summit, becoming the first woman to summit twelve eight-thousanders.[50]\n* In May 2009, Kinga Baranowska was the first Polish woman to reach the summit of Kangchenjunga.[51]\n* In 2011, Tunç Fındık became the first Turkish man to reach the peak of Kangchenjunga, his seventh eight thousander, with Swiss partner Guntis Brandts via the British 1955 SW Face route.[52][53]\n* In May 2011, Indian mountaineers Basanta Singha Roy and Debasish Biswas successfully scaled Kangchenjunga Main.[54]\n* In May 2013, five climbers including Hungarian Zsolt Erőss and Péter Kiss reached the summit, but disappeared during the descent.[55]\n* In May 2014, Bulgarian Boyan Petrov reached the peak without the use of supplemental oxygen.[56]\n* In May 2014, Chhanda Gayen was the first Indian woman to summit. She was killed by an avalanche on the descent.[57]\n* In May 2022, Indian Narayanan Iyer died during a summit push on the mountain.[58]\n\n\nDespite improved climbing gear the fatality rate of climbers attempting to summit Kanchenjunga is high. Since the 1990s, more than 20% of people died while climbing Kanchenjunga's main peak.[59]\n\n\n\n## Tourism[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Tourism in North East India\n\n![](image)Kanchenjunga as seen from Gangtok, Sikkim\nBecause of its remote location in Nepal and the difficulty involved in accessing it from India, the Kangchenjunga region is not much explored by trekkers. It has, therefore, retained much of its pristine beauty. In Sikkim too, trekking into the Kangchenjunga region has just recently been permitted. The Goecha La trek is gaining popularity amongst tourists. It goes to the Goecha La Pass, located right in front of the huge southeast face of Kangchenjunga. Another trek to Green Lake Basin has recently[*when?*] been opened for trekking. This trek goes to the Northeast side of Kangchenjunga along the famous Zemu Glacier. The film Singalila in the Himalaya is a journey around Kangchenjunga.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Kangchenjunga sunrise from Jalpaiguri\n## In myth[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Five Treasures of Snow\nThe area around Kangchenjunga is said to be home to a mountain deity, called *Dzö-nga*[60] or \"Kangchenjunga Demon\", a type of yeti or rakshasa. A British geological expedition in 1925 spotted a bipedal creature which they asked the locals about, who referred to it as the \"Kangchenjunga Demon\".[61]\n\n\nFor generations, there have been legends recounted by the inhabitants of the areas surrounding Kanchenjunga, both in Sikkim and in Nepal, that there is a valley of immortality hidden on its slopes. These stories are well known to both the original inhabitants of the area, the Lepcha people and Limbu people, and those of the Tibetan Buddhist cultural tradition. In Tibetan, this valley is known as Beyul Demoshong. In 1962, a Tibetan Lama by the name of Tulshuk Lingpa led over 300 followers into the high snow slopes of Kanchenjunga, to ‘open the way’ to Beyul Demoshong. The story of this expedition is recounted in the 2011 book *A Step Away from Paradise*.[62]\n\n\n\n![](image)Kangchenjunga seen from Tetulia, Panchagarh, Northern Bangladesh\n## In literature[edit]\n\n\n![](image)East face of Kangchenjunga, from near the Zemu Glacier, Sikkim\n* In the *Swallows and Amazons* series of books by Arthur Ransome, a high mountain (unnamed in the books) is given the name \"Kanchenjunga\" by the children when they climb it in 1931.\n* In *The Epic of Mount Everest*, first published in 1926, Sir Francis Younghusband: \" For natural beauty Darjiling (Darjeeling) is surely unsurpassed in the world. From all countries travellers come there to see the famous view of Kangchenjunga, 28,150 feet (8,580 m) in height, and only 40 miles (64 km) distant. Darjiling (Darjeeling) itself is 7,000 feet (2,100 m) above sea-level and is set in a forest of oaks, magnolia, rhododendrons, laurels and sycamores. And through these forests, the observer looks down the steep mountain-sides to the Rangeet River only 1,000 feet (300 m) above sea-level, and then up and up through tier after tier of forest-clad ranges, each bathed in a haze of deeper and deeper purple, till the line of snow is reached; and then still up to the summit of Kangchenjunga, now so pure and ethereal we can scarcely believe it is part of the solid earth on which we stand; and so high it seems part of the very sky itself.\"\n* In 1999, official James Bond author Raymond Benson published *High Time to Kill*. In this story, a microdot containing a secret formula for aviation technology is stolen by a society called the Union. During their escape, their plane crashes on the slopes of Kangchenjunga. James Bond becomes part of a climbing expedition in order to retrieve the formula.\n* *The Inheritance of Loss* by Kiran Desai, which won the 2006 Man Booker Prize, is set partly in Kalimpong, a hill station situated near Kangchenjunga.\n* In *Legend of the Galactic Heroes* by Yoshiki Tanaka, which won the Seiun Award for \"Best Novel of the Year\" in 1988 and was adapted into an anime series by Kitty Films, the capital and holiest temple of the Terraist Cult is on Earth beneath the rubble of Kangchenjunga.\n* Michelle Paver's 2016 ghost story *Thin Air* concerns a fictional expedition to climb Kangchenjunga in 1935, and an earlier (also fictional) expedition in 1906.\n* The book *Round Kangchenjunga – A Narrative of Mountain Travel and Exploration* by Douglas Freshfield gives a complete account of his travel around Kangchenjunga.\n* Susan Jagannath's book *Chasing Himalayan Dreams: A trek in the shadow of Kanchenjunga and Everest* details her 61km, 6-day trek up and around Kangchenjunga.\n* Kate Bush's song \"Wild Man\"-\"Well, the first verse of the song is just quickly going through some of the terms that the Yeti is known by and one of those names is the Kangchenjunga Demon. He’s also known as Wild Man and Abominable Snowman. (...) I don’t refer to the Yeti as a man in the song. But it is meant to be an empathetic view of a creature of great mystery really. And I suppose it’s the idea really that mankind wants to grab hold of something [like the Yeti] and stick it in a cage or a box and make money out of it. And to go back to your question, I think we’re very arrogant in our separation from the animal kingdom and generally as a species we are enormously arrogant and aggressive. Look at the way we treat the planet and animals and it’s pretty terrible isn’t it? (John Doran, 'A Demon In The Drift: Kate Bush Interviewed'.

Its summit lies at 8,586 m (28,169 ft) in a section of the Himalayas, the *Kangchenjunga Himal*, which is bounded in the west by the Tamur River, in the north by the Lhonak River and Jongsang La, and in the east by the Teesta River.[1][3] It lies in the border region between Nepal and Sikkim state of India, with three of the five peaks, namely Main, Central and South, directly on the border,[4] and the peaks West and Kangbachen in Nepal's Taplejung District.[5]\n\n\nUntil 1852, Kangchenjunga was assumed to be the highest mountain in the world, but calculations and measurements by the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India in 1849 showed that Mount Everest, known as Peak XV at the time, is actually higher. After allowing for further verification of all calculations, it was officially announced in 1856 that Kangchenjunga was the third-highest mountain.[6]\n\n\nThe Kangchenjunga is a sacred mountain in Nepal and Sikkim and was first climbed on 25 May 1955 by Joe Brown and George Band, who were part of the 1955 British Kangchenjunga expedition. They stopped just short of the true summit, keeping a promise given to Tashi Namgyal, the Chogyal of Sikkim, that the top of the mountain would remain inviolate.[7] The Indian side of the mountain is off-limits to climbers. In 2016, the adjoining Khangchendzonga National Park was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\n*Kangchenjunga* is the official spelling adopted by Douglas Freshfield, Alexander Mitchell Kellas and the Royal Geographical Society that gives the best indication of the Tibetan pronunciation. Freshfield referred to the spelling used by the Indian Government since the late 19th century.[3] Alternative spellings include Kanchenjunga, Khangchendzonga and Kangchendzönga.[8][9][10]\n\n\nThe brothers Hermann, Adolf and Robert Schlagintweit explained the local name 'Kanchinjínga' meaning “The five treasures of the high snow” as originating from the Tibetan word \"gangs\" pronounced [kaŋ] meaning snow, ice; \"chen\" pronounced [tɕen] meaning great; \"mzod\" meaning treasure; \"lnga\" meaning five.[11]\nLocal Lhopo people believe that the treasures are hidden but reveal themselves to the devout when the world is in peril; the treasures comprise salt, gold, turquoise and precious stones, sacred scriptures, invincible armor or ammunition, grain and medicine.[12]\n\n\n\n## Protected areas[edit]\n\n\nThe Kangchenjunga landscape is a complex of three distinct ecoregions: the eastern Himalayan broad-leaved and coniferous forests, the Eastern Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows and the Terai-Duar savanna and grasslands.[13]\nThe Kangchenjunga transboundary landscape is shared by Nepal, India, Bhutan and China, and comprises 14 protected areas with a total of 6,032 km2 (2,329 sq mi):[14]\n\n\n\n* Nepal: Kanchenjunga Conservation Area\n* Sikkim, India: Khangchendzonga National Park, Varsey Rhododendron Sanctuary, Fambong Lho Wildlife Sanctuary, Kyongnosla Alpine Sanctuary, Maenam Wildlife Sanctuary, Shingba Rhododendron Sanctuary and Pangolakha Wildlife Sanctuary\n* Darjeeling, India: Jore Pokhri Wildlife Sanctuary, Singalila National Park, Senchal Wildlife Sanctuary, Mahananda Wildlife Sanctuary and Neora Valley National Park\n* Bhutan: Torsa Strict Nature Reserve\n\n\nThese protected areas are habitats for many globally significant plant species such as rhododendrons and orchids and many endangered flagship species such as snow leopard (*Panthera uncia*), Asian black bear (*Ursus thibetanus*), red panda (*Ailurus fulgens*), white-bellied musk deer (*Moschus leucogaster*), blood pheasant (*Ithaginis cruentus*) and chestnut-breasted partridge (*Arborophila mandellii*).[14]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nPanorama of the Kangchenjunga massif from Tiger Hill, Darjeeling\n\nThe *Kangchenjunga Himal* section of the Himalayas lies both in Nepal and India and encompasses 16 peaks over 7,000 m (23,000 ft). In the north, it is limited by the Lhonak Chu, Goma Chu and Jongsang La, and in the east by the Teesta River. The western limit runs from the Jongsang La down the Gingsang and Kangchenjunga glaciers and the rivers of Ghunsa and Tamur.[1] Kanchenjunga rises about 20 km (12 mi) south of the general alignment of the Great Himalayan range about 125 km (78 mi) east-southeast of Mount Everest as the crow flies. South of the southern face of Kanchenjunga runs the 3,000–3,500-metre-high (9,800–11,500 ft) Singalila Ridge that separates Sikkim from Nepal and northern West Bengal.[15]\n\n\nKangchenjunga and its satellite peaks form a huge mountain massif.[16] The massif's five highest peaks are listed in the following table.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Name of peak\n | Height (m)\n | Height (ft)\n | Location\n | Prominence (m)\n | Prominence (ft)\n | Nearest Higher Neighbor\n | Location (political)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Kangchenjunga Main[2] | 8,586\n | 28,169\n | 27°42′11″N 88°08′52″E﻿ / ﻿27.70306°N 88.14778°E﻿ / 27.70306; 88.14778 | 3,922\n | 12,867\n | Mount Everest – South Summit\n | Mangan district, Sikkim, India / Taplejung, Koshi Province, Nepal\n |\n| Kangchenjunga West (Yalung Kang)[17] | 8,505\n | 27,904\n | 27°42′18″N 88°08′12″E﻿ / ﻿27.70500°N 88.13667°E﻿ / 27.70500; 88.13667 | 135\n | 443\n | Kangchenjunga\n | Taplejung, Koshi Province, Nepal\n |\n| Kangchenjunga Central[18] | 8,482\n | 27,828\n | 27°41′46″N 88°09′04″E﻿ / ﻿27.69611°N 88.15111°E﻿ / 27.69611; 88.15111 | 32\n | 105\n | Kangchenjunga South\n | Mangan district, Sikkim, India / Taplejung, Koshi Province, Nepal\n |\n| Kangchenjunga South[19] | 8,494\n | 27,867\n | 27°41′30″N 88°09′15″E﻿ / ﻿27.69167°N 88.15417°E﻿ / 27.69167; 88.15417 | 119\n | 390\n | Kangchenjunga\n | Mangan district, Sikkim, India / Taplejung, Koshi Province, Nepal\n |\n| Kangbachen[20] | 7,903\n | 25,928\n | 27°42′42″N 88°06′30″E﻿ / ﻿27.71167°N 88.10833°E﻿ / 27.71167; 88.10833 | 103\n | 337\n | Kangchenjunga West\n | Taplejung, Koshi Province, Nepal\n |\n\n\n![](image)Kangchenjunga map by Garwood, 1903[3]\n![](image)Southwest (Yalung) face of Kangchenjunga seen from Nepal\nThe main ridge of the massif runs from north-northeast to south-southwest and forms a watershed to several rivers.[16] Together with ridges running roughly from east to west they form a giant cross.[3] These ridges contain a host of peaks between 6,000 and 8,586 m (19,685 and 28,169 ft). The northern section includes Yalung Kang, Kangchenjunga Central and South, Kangbachen, Kirat Chuli and Gimmigela Chuli, and runs up to the Jongsang La. The eastern ridge in Sikkim includes Siniolchu. The southern section runs along the Nepal–Sikkim border and includes Kabru I to III.[1] This ridge extends southwards to the Singalila Ridge.[21] The western ridge culminates in the Kumbhakarna, also known as Jannu.[1]\n\n\nFour main glaciers radiate from the peak, pointing roughly to the northeast, southeast, northwest and southwest. The *Zemu* glacier in the northeast and the *Talung* glacier in the southeast drain to the Teesta River; the *Yalung* glacier in the southwest and the *Kangchen* glacier in the northwest drain to the Arun and Kosi rivers.[22]\nThe glaciers spread over the area above approximately 5,000 m (16,000 ft), and the glacialized area covers about 314 km2 (121 sq mi) in total.[23] There are 120 glaciers in the Kanchenjunga Himal, of which 17 are debris-covered. Between 1958 and 1992, more than half of 57 examined glaciers had retreated, possibly due to rising of air temperature.[24]\n\n\nKangchenjunga Main is the highest elevation of the Brahmaputra River basin, which forms part of the southeast Asian monsoon regime and is among the globally largest river basins.[25]\nKangchenjunga is one of six peaks above 8,000 m (26,000 ft) located in the basin of the Kosi River, which is among the largest tributaries of the Ganges.[26]\nThe Kangchenjunga massif forms also part of the Ganges Basin.[27]\n\n\nAlthough it is the third highest peak in the world, Kangchenjunga is only ranked 29th by topographic prominence, a measure of a mountain's independent stature. The key col for Kangchenjunga lies at a height of 4,664 metres (15,302 ft), along the watershed boundary between Arun and Brahmaputra rivers in Tibet.[28] It is, however, the fourth-most-prominent peak in the Himalayas, after Everest, and the western and eastern anchors of the Himalaya, Nanga Parbat and Namcha Barwa, respectively.[29]\n\n\n\n## Climbing routes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kanchenjunga-north from base camp in Nepal\nThere are four climbing routes to reach the summit of Kangchenjunga, three of which are in Nepal from the southwest, northwest, and northeast, and one from northeastern Sikkim in India. To date, the northeastern route from Sikkim has been successfully used only three times. The Indian government has banned expeditions to Kanchenjunga; therefore, this route has been closed since 2000.[30]\n\n\n\n## Climbing history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Painting of *Kanchinjínga* as seen from the Singalila Ridge by Hermann Schlagintweit, 1855[31]\n![](image)Sunset on Kangchenjunga, 1905[32]\n![](image)South face of Kangchenjunga seen from Goecha La, Sikkim at 4,940 m (16,210 ft)\n![](image)Kangchenjunga seen from Darjeeling War Memorial\n![](image)Kangchenjunga and surrounding peaks at sunset from ISS, December 2019\n### Early reconnaissances and attempts[edit]\n\n\n* Between April 1848 and February 1849, Joseph Dalton Hooker explored parts of northern Sikkim and eastern Nepal, mainly to collect plants and study the distribution of Himalayan flora. He was based in Darjeeling, and made repeated excursions in the river valleys and into the foothills of Kangchenjunga up to an altitude of 15,620 ft (4,760 m).[33]\n* In spring 1855, the German explorer Hermann Schlagintweit travelled to Darjeeling but was not allowed to proceed further north due to the Third Nepal–Tibet War. In May, he explored the Singalila Ridge up to the peak of Tonglo for a meteorological survey.[31]\n* In 1879, Sarat Chandra Das and Lama Ugyen-gyatso crossed into Tibet west of \"Kanchanjinga\" via eastern Nepal and the Tashilhunpo Monastery en route to Lhasa. They returned along the same route in 1881.[34]\n* In 1883, a party of William Woodman Graham together with two Swiss mountaineers climbed in the area of Kangchenjunga. They were the first who ascended Kabru within 30–40 ft (9.1–12.2 m) below the summit. They crossed the Kang La pass and climbed a peak of nearly 19,000 ft (5,800 m) from which they examined Jannu. They concluded it was too late in the year for an attempt and returned once again to Darjeeling.[35]\n* Between October 1885 and January 1886, Rinzin Namgyal surveyed the unexplored north and west sides of Kangchenjunga. He was the first native surveyor to map the circuit of Kangchenjunga and provided sketches of each side of the peak and the adjoining valleys. He also defined the frontiers of Nepal, Tibet and Sikkim in this area.[36]\n* In 1899, British mountaineer Douglas Freshfield set out with his party comprising the Italian photographer Vittorio Sella. They were the first mountaineers to examine the lower and upper ramparts, and the great western face of Kangchenjunga, rising from the Kangchenjunga Glacier.[3]\n* In 1905, a party headed by Aleister Crowley made the first attempt at climbing the mountain. Aleister Crowley had been part of the team attempting the 1902 ascent of K2. The team reached an estimated altitude of 6,500 m (21,300 ft) on the southwest side of the mountain before turning back. The exact height reached is somewhat unclear; Crowley stated that on 31 August, \"We were certainly over 21,000 ft (6,400 m) and possibly over 22,000 ft (6,700 m)\", when the team was forced to retreat to Camp 5 by the risk of avalanche. On 1 September, they evidently went further; some members of the team, Reymond, Pache and Salama, \"got over the bad patch\" that had forced them to return to Camp 5 the day before, and progressed \"out of sight and hearing\" before returning to Crowley and the men with packs, who could not cross the dangerous section unassisted with their burdens. It is not clear how far Reymond, Pache and Salama had ascended—but in summarizing, Crowley ventured \"We had reached a height of approximately 25,000 ft (7,600 m).\" Attempting a \"mutinous\" late-in-the-day descent from Camp 5 to Camp 3, climber Alexis Pache (who earlier that day had been one of three to ascend possibly higher than any before), and three local porters, were killed in an avalanche.[37] Despite the insistence of one of the men that \"the demon of Kangchenjunga was propitiated with the sacrifice\", Crowley decided the accident and its ramifications made it impossible to continue the expedition.[32]\n* In 1907, two Norwegians set about climbing *Jongri* via the Kabru glacier to the south, an approach apparently rejected by Graham's party. Progress was very slow, partly because of problems with supplies and porters, and presumably also lack of fitness and acclimatisation. However, from a high camp at about 22,600 ft (6,900 m) they were eventually able to reach a point 50 or 60 ft (15 or 18 m) below the summit before they were turned back by strong winds.[35]\n* In 1929, the German Paul Bauer led an expedition team that reached 7,400 m (24,300 ft) on the northeast spur before being turned back by a five-day storm.[38]\n* In May 1929, the American E. F. Farmer left Darjeeling with native porters, crossed the Kang La into Nepal and climbed up towards the *Talung Saddle*. When his porters refused to go any further, he climbed alone further upwards through drifting mists but did not return.[16]\n* In 1930, Günter Dyhrenfurth led an international expedition comprising the German Uli Wieland, Austrian Erwin Schneider and Englishman Frank Smythe who attempted to climb Kangchenjunga. They failed because of poor weather and snow conditions.[16]\n* In 1931, Paul Bauer led a second German expedition team who attempted the northeast spur before being turned back by bad weather, illnesses and deaths. The team, including Peter Aufschnaiter, retreated after climbing 300 m higher than the 1929 attempt.[38]\n* In 1954, John Kempe led a party comprising J. W. Tucker, S. R. Jackson, G. C. Lewis, T. H. Braham and medical officer D. S. Mathews. They explored the upper Yalung glacier with the intention to discover a practicable route to the great ice-shelf that runs across the southwest face of Kangchenjunga.[39] This reconnaissance led to the route used by the successful 1955 expedition.[40]\n\n\n### First ascent[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1955 British Kangchenjunga expedition\n\n![](image)A sign board on the last traversable road to Kangchenjunga\n![](image)First ascent reunion of 1990– front (left to right): Neil Mather, John Angelo Jackson, Charles Evans and Joe Brown, and rear (left to right): Tony Streather, Norman Hardie, George Band and Professor John Clegg\nIn 1955, Joe Brown and George Band made the first ascent on 25 May, followed by Norman Hardie and Tony Streather on 26 May. The full team also included John Clegg (team doctor), Charles Evans (team leader), John Angelo Jackson, Neil Mather and Tom Mackinnon.[8]\nThe ascent proved that Aleister Crowley's 1905 route (also investigated by the 1954 reconnaissance) was viable. The route starts on the Yalung Glacier to the southwest of the peak, and climbs the Yalung Face, which is 3,000 metres (10,000 ft) high. The main feature of this face is the \"Great Shelf\", a large sloping plateau at around 7,500 metres (24,600 ft), covered by a hanging glacier. The route is almost entirely on snow, glacier and one icefall; the summit ridge itself can involve a small amount of travel on rock. The first ascent expedition made six camps above their base camp, two below the Shelf, two on it, and two above it. They started on 18 April, and everyone was back to base camp by 28 May.[41] Other members of this expedition included John Angelo Jackson and Tom Mackinnon.[42]\n\n\n\n### Other notable ascents[edit]\n\n\nKangchenjunga 3D animation\n* 1973 Yutaka Ageta and Takeo Matsuda of the Japanese expedition summited Kangchenjunga West, also called Yalung Kang, by climbing the southwestern ridge. Matsuda never returned to camp and his body was never found. The expedition concluded that he had fallen during descent when he was separated from Ageta.[43]\n* 1977 The second ascent of Kangchenjunga, by an Indian Army team led by Colonel Narendra Kumar. They completed the northeast spur, the difficult ridge that defeated German expeditions in 1929 and 1931.[44]\n* 1978 Polish teams made the first successful ascents of the summits Kangchenjunga South (Wojciech Wróż and Eugeniusz Chrobak, 19 May) and Kangchenjunga Central (Wojciech Brański, Zygmunt Andrzej Heinrich, Kazimierz Olech, 22 May).[45]\n* 1979 The third ascent, on 16 May, and the first without oxygen, by Doug Scott, Peter Boardman and Joe Tasker, establishing a new route on the North Ridge.[46]\n* 1992 Carlos Carsolio made the only summit that year. It was in a solo climb without supplementary oxygen.[47]\n* 1995 Benoît Chamoux, Pierre Royer and their Sherpa guide Riku disappeared on 6 October near the summit.[48]\n* 1998 Ginette Harrison was the first woman to climb Kangchenjunga's North Face.[49]\n* 2009 Edurne Pasaban, a Spanish mountaineer, reached the summit, becoming the first woman to summit twelve eight-thousanders.[50]\n* In May 2009, Kinga Baranowska was the first Polish woman to reach the summit of Kangchenjunga.[51]\n* In 2011, Tunç Fındık became the first Turkish man to reach the peak of Kangchenjunga, his seventh eight thousander, with Swiss partner Guntis Brandts via the British 1955 SW Face route.[52][53]\n* In May 2011, Indian mountaineers Basanta Singha Roy and Debasish Biswas successfully scaled Kangchenjunga Main.[54]\n* In May 2013, five climbers including Hungarian Zsolt Erőss and Péter Kiss reached the summit, but disappeared during the descent.[55]\n* In May 2014, Bulgarian Boyan Petrov reached the peak without the use of supplemental oxygen.[56]\n* In May 2014, Chhanda Gayen was the first Indian woman to summit. She was killed by an avalanche on the descent.[57]\n* In May 2022, Indian Narayanan Iyer died during a summit push on the mountain.[58]\n\n\nDespite improved climbing gear the fatality rate of climbers attempting to summit Kanchenjunga is high. Since the 1990s, more than 20% of people died while climbing Kanchenjunga's main peak.[59]\n\n\n\n## Tourism[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Tourism in North East India\n\n![](image)Kanchenjunga as seen from Gangtok, Sikkim\nBecause of its remote location in Nepal and the difficulty involved in accessing it from India, the Kangchenjunga region is not much explored by trekkers. It has, therefore, retained much of its pristine beauty. In Sikkim too, trekking into the Kangchenjunga region has just recently been permitted. The Goecha La trek is gaining popularity amongst tourists. It goes to the Goecha La Pass, located right in front of the huge southeast face of Kangchenjunga. Another trek to Green Lake Basin has recently[*when?*] been opened for trekking. This trek goes to the Northeast side of Kangchenjunga along the famous Zemu Glacier. The film Singalila in the Himalaya is a journey around Kangchenjunga.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Kangchenjunga sunrise from Jalpaiguri\n## In myth[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Five Treasures of Snow\nThe area around Kangchenjunga is said to be home to a mountain deity, called *Dzö-nga*[60] or \"Kangchenjunga Demon\", a type of yeti or rakshasa. A British geological expedition in 1925 spotted a bipedal creature which they asked the locals about, who referred to it as the \"Kangchenjunga Demon\".[61]\n\n\nFor generations, there have been legends recounted by the inhabitants of the areas surrounding Kanchenjunga, both in Sikkim and in Nepal, that there is a valley of immortality hidden on its slopes. These stories are well known to both the original inhabitants of the area, the Lepcha people and Limbu people, and those of the Tibetan Buddhist cultural tradition. In Tibetan, this valley is known as Beyul Demoshong. In 1962, a Tibetan Lama by the name of Tulshuk Lingpa led over 300 followers into the high snow slopes of Kanchenjunga, to ‘open the way’ to Beyul Demoshong. The story of this expedition is recounted in the 2011 book *A Step Away from Paradise*.[62]\n\n\n\n![](image)Kangchenjunga seen from Tetulia, Panchagarh, Northern Bangladesh\n## In literature[edit]\n\n\n![](image)East face of Kangchenjunga, from near the Zemu Glacier, Sikkim\n* In the *Swallows and Amazons* series of books by Arthur Ransome, a high mountain (unnamed in the books) is given the name \"Kanchenjunga\" by the children when they climb it in 1931.\n* In *The Epic of Mount Everest*, first published in 1926, Sir Francis Younghusband: \" For natural beauty Darjiling (Darjeeling) is surely unsurpassed in the world. From all countries travellers come there to see the famous view of Kangchenjunga, 28,150 feet (8,580 m) in height, and only 40 miles (64 km) distant. Darjiling (Darjeeling) itself is 7,000 feet (2,100 m) above sea-level and is set in a forest of oaks, magnolia, rhododendrons, laurels and sycamores. And through these forests, the observer looks down the steep mountain-sides to the Rangeet River only 1,000 feet (300 m) above sea-level, and then up and up through tier after tier of forest-clad ranges, each bathed in a haze of deeper and deeper purple, till the line of snow is reached; and then still up to the summit of Kangchenjunga, now so pure and ethereal we can scarcely believe it is part of the solid earth on which we stand; and so high it seems part of the very sky itself.\"\n* In 1999, official James Bond author Raymond Benson published *High Time to Kill*. In this story, a microdot containing a secret formula for aviation technology is stolen by a society called the Union. During their escape, their plane crashes on the slopes of Kangchenjunga. James Bond becomes part of a climbing expedition in order to retrieve the formula.\n* *The Inheritance of Loss* by Kiran Desai, which won the 2006 Man Booker Prize, is set partly in Kalimpong, a hill station situated near Kangchenjunga.\n* In *Legend of the Galactic Heroes* by Yoshiki Tanaka, which won the Seiun Award for \"Best Novel of the Year\" in 1988 and was adapted into an anime series by Kitty Films, the capital and holiest temple of the Terraist Cult is on Earth beneath the rubble of Kangchenjunga.\n* Michelle Paver's 2016 ghost story *Thin Air* concerns a fictional expedition to climb Kangchenjunga in 1935, and an earlier (also fictional) expedition in 1906.\n* The book *Round Kangchenjunga – A Narrative of Mountain Travel and Exploration* by Douglas Freshfield gives a complete account of his travel around Kangchenjunga.\n* Susan Jagannath's book *Chasing Himalayan Dreams: A trek in the shadow of Kanchenjunga and Everest* details her 61km, 6-day trek up and around Kangchenjunga.\n* Kate Bush's song \"Wild Man\"-\"Well, the first verse of the song is just quickly going through some of the terms that the Yeti is known by and one of those names is the Kangchenjunga Demon. He’s also known as Wild Man and Abominable Snowman. (...) I don’t refer to the Yeti as a man in the song. But it is meant to be an empathetic view of a creature of great mystery really. And I suppose it’s the idea really that mankind wants to grab hold of something [like the Yeti] and stick it in a cage or a box and make money out of it. And to go back to your question, I think we’re very arrogant in our separation from the animal kingdom and generally as a species we are enormously arrogant and aggressive. Look at the way we treat the planet and animals and it’s pretty terrible isn’t it? (John Doran, 'A Demon In The Drift: Kate Bush Interviewed'.

The main summit is on the border between Tibet Autonomous Region of China and the Khumbu region of Nepal.\n\n\nWith Everest to the north and Nuptse to the west, Lhotse forms the apex of the massive horseshoe-shaped arc of the Everest massif. Despite the tremendous vertical relief of its South and Northeast Faces, it is the least prominent of the eight-thousanders due to the great height of the South Col between it and Everest. Lhotse's Western Face, recessed behind the head of the Khumbu Glacier in the Western Cwm, plays an integral part in the standard routes of ascent for both peaks; the name Lhotse, which means \"South Peak\" in Tibetan, further emphasizes the close relationship between the two.\n\n\nThe main ridge of the mountain features four distinct summits: Lhotse Main at 8,516 metres (27,940 ft) above sea level, Lhotse Middle (also known as Lhotse Central I or Lhotse East) at 8,414 m (27,605 ft), Lhotse Central II at 8,372 m (27,467 ft) and Lhotse Shar at 8,383 m (27,503 ft). Though Lhotse Main is considered to be an intermediately difficult eight-thousander when ascended from the standard Reiss Couloir route, its secondary summits and extremely steep South Face are regarded as some of the most difficult and dangerous climbs in the world.[2][3]Its icy North East Face remains unclimbed.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## Climbing[edit]\n\n\nAn early attempt on Lhotse was made by the 1955 International Himalayan Expedition, headed by Norman Dyhrenfurth. It also included two Austrians (cartographers Erwin Schneider and Ernst Senn) and two Swiss (Bruno Spirig and Arthur Spöhel), and was the first expedition in the Everest area to include Americans (Fred Beckey, George Bell, and Richard McGowan). The Nepalese liaison officer was Gaya Nanda Vaidya. They were accompanied by 200 local porters and several climbing Sherpas. After a brief look at the dangerous southern approaches of Lhotse Shar, they turned their attention, during September and October, to the Western Cwm and the northwest face of Lhotse, on which they achieved an altitude of about 8,100 metres (26,600 ft). They were beaten back by unexpectedly strong wind and low temperatures. Under Schneider's direction, they completed the first map of the Everest area (1:50,000 photogrammetric). The expedition also made several short films covering local cultural topics and made a number of first ascents of smaller peaks in the Khumbu region.[5]\n\n\nThe main summit of Lhotse was first climbed on 18 May 1956, by the Swiss team of Ernst Reiss and Fritz Luchsinger, members of the Swiss Mount Everest/Lhotse Expedition.[6][7]\n\n\nOn 12 May 1970, Sepp Mayerl and Rolf Walter of Austria made the first ascent of Lhotse Shar.[8]\n\n\nOn 12 May 1999, Czech climber Soňa Vomáčková reached the main summit and thus became the first woman to reach it without supplemental oxygen.\n[9]\n\n\nLhotse Middle remained, for a long time, the highest unclimbed named point on Earth; its first ascent was made on 23 May 2001 by Eugeny Vinogradsky, Sergei Timofeev, Alexei Bolotov and Petr Kuznetsov of a Russian expedition.[10]\n\n\nThe Lhotse standard climbing route follows the same path as Everest's South Col route up to the Yellow Band beyond Camp 3.

The Lhotse Face (centre right) is connected to Mount Everest (centre left) by the South Col (centre, lowest point on horizon).\n### Lhotse Face[edit]\n\n\nThe western flank of Lhotse is known as the *Lhotse Face*. Any climber bound for the South Col on Everest must climb this 1,125 m (3,690 ft) wall of glacial blue ice. This face rises at 40 and 50-degree pitches with the occasional 80-degree bulges. High-altitude climbing Sherpas and the lead climbers will set fixed ropes up this wall of ice. Climbers and porters need to establish a good rhythm of foot placement and pull themselves up the ropes using their jumars. Two rocky sections called the Yellow Band and the Geneva Spur interrupt the icy ascent on the upper part of the face.\n\n\nOn 19 May 2016, a high-altitude mountain worker, Ang Furba Sherpa, died when he slipped and fell down the Lhotse face.[32]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nSouthern and northern climbing routes as seen from the International Space Station.

The main summit is on the border between Tibet Autonomous Region of China and the Khumbu region of Nepal.\n\n\nWith Everest to the north and Nuptse to the west, Lhotse forms the apex of the massive horseshoe-shaped arc of the Everest massif. Despite the tremendous vertical relief of its South and Northeast Faces, it is the least prominent of the eight-thousanders due to the great height of the South Col between it and Everest. Lhotse's Western Face, recessed behind the head of the Khumbu Glacier in the Western Cwm, plays an integral part in the standard routes of ascent for both peaks; the name Lhotse, which means \"South Peak\" in Tibetan, further emphasizes the close relationship between the two.\n\n\nThe main ridge of the mountain features four distinct summits: Lhotse Main at 8,516 metres (27,940 ft) above sea level, Lhotse Middle (also known as Lhotse Central I or Lhotse East) at 8,414 m (27,605 ft), Lhotse Central II at 8,372 m (27,467 ft) and Lhotse Shar at 8,383 m (27,503 ft). Though Lhotse Main is considered to be an intermediately difficult eight-thousander when ascended from the standard Reiss Couloir route, its secondary summits and extremely steep South Face are regarded as some of the most difficult and dangerous climbs in the world.[2][3]Its icy North East Face remains unclimbed.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## Climbing[edit]\n\n\nAn early attempt on Lhotse was made by the 1955 International Himalayan Expedition, headed by Norman Dyhrenfurth. It also included two Austrians (cartographers Erwin Schneider and Ernst Senn) and two Swiss (Bruno Spirig and Arthur Spöhel), and was the first expedition in the Everest area to include Americans (Fred Beckey, George Bell, and Richard McGowan). The Nepalese liaison officer was Gaya Nanda Vaidya. They were accompanied by 200 local porters and several climbing Sherpas. After a brief look at the dangerous southern approaches of Lhotse Shar, they turned their attention, during September and October, to the Western Cwm and the northwest face of Lhotse, on which they achieved an altitude of about 8,100 metres (26,600 ft). They were beaten back by unexpectedly strong wind and low temperatures. Under Schneider's direction, they completed the first map of the Everest area (1:50,000 photogrammetric). The expedition also made several short films covering local cultural topics and made a number of first ascents of smaller peaks in the Khumbu region.[5]\n\n\nThe main summit of Lhotse was first climbed on 18 May 1956, by the Swiss team of Ernst Reiss and Fritz Luchsinger, members of the Swiss Mount Everest/Lhotse Expedition.[6][7]\n\n\nOn 12 May 1970, Sepp Mayerl and Rolf Walter of Austria made the first ascent of Lhotse Shar.[8]\n\n\nOn 12 May 1999, Czech climber Soňa Vomáčková reached the main summit and thus became the first woman to reach it without supplemental oxygen.\n[9]\n\n\nLhotse Middle remained, for a long time, the highest unclimbed named point on Earth; its first ascent was made on 23 May 2001 by Eugeny Vinogradsky, Sergei Timofeev, Alexei Bolotov and Petr Kuznetsov of a Russian expedition.[10]\n\n\nThe Lhotse standard climbing route follows the same path as Everest's South Col route up to the Yellow Band beyond Camp 3. After the Yellow Band, the routes diverge with climbers bound for Everest taking a left over the Geneva Spur up to the South Col, while Lhotse climbers take a right further up the Lhotse face. The last part to the summit leads through the narrow \"Reiss couloir\" until the Lhotse main peak is reached.\n\n\nBy December 2008, 371 climbers had summited Lhotse while 20 had died during their attempt.[11] Lhotse was not summited in 2014, 2015, or 2016 due to a series of incidents. It was next summited in May 2017.[12]\n\n\n\n![](image)Nuptse Ridge, Everest, Lhotse, and Lhotse Shar peaks\n### Timeline[edit]\n\n\n* 1955 Attempt by the International Himalayan Expedition.[5]\n* 1956 May 18 First ascent of the main summit: Fritz Luchsinger and Ernst Reiss.[6]\n* 1965 First attempt on Lhotse Shar by a Japanese expedition – reached 8,100 m (26,570 ft).[13]\n* 1970 May 12 First ascent of Lhotse Shar by an Austrian expedition, Sepp Mayerl, Rolf Walter.\n* 1973 First attempt on the South Face by a Japanese expedition led by Ryohei Uchida.\n* 1974 December 25 First attempt of an 8,000-meter peak in winter.

The Lhotse Face (centre right) is connected to Mount Everest (centre left) by the South Col (centre, lowest point on horizon).\n### Lhotse Face[edit]\n\n\nThe western flank of Lhotse is known as the *Lhotse Face*. Any climber bound for the South Col on Everest must climb this 1,125 m (3,690 ft) wall of glacial blue ice. This face rises at 40 and 50-degree pitches with the occasional 80-degree bulges. High-altitude climbing Sherpas and the lead climbers will set fixed ropes up this wall of ice. Climbers and porters need to establish a good rhythm of foot placement and pull themselves up the ropes using their jumars. Two rocky sections called the Yellow Band and the Geneva Spur interrupt the icy ascent on the upper part of the face.\n\n\nOn 19 May 2016, a high-altitude mountain worker, Ang Furba Sherpa, died when he slipped and fell down the Lhotse face.[32]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nSouthern and northern climbing routes as seen from the International Space Station.

It is located in the Mahalangur Himalayas 19 km (12 mi) southeast of Mount Everest, on the China–Nepal border. One of the eight-thousanders, Makalu is an isolated peak in the shape of a four-sided pyramid.\n\n\nMakalu has two notable subsidiary peaks. Kangchungtse, or Makalu II (7,678 m) lies about three kilometres (two miles) north-northwest of the main summit. Rising about 5 km (3 mi) north-northeast of the main summit across a broad plateau, and connected to Kangchungtse by a narrow, 7,200 m saddle, is Chomo Lonzo (7,804 m).\n\n\n\n\n## Climbing history[edit]\n\n\nThe first climb on Makalu was made by an American team led by Riley Keegan in the spring of 1954. The expedition was composed of Sierra Club members including Bill Long and Allen Steck, and was called the California Himalayan Expedition to Makalu.[3]\nThey attempted the southeast ridge but were turned back at 7,100 metres (23,300 ft) by a constant barrage of storms. A New Zealand team including Sir Edmund Hillary was also active in the spring, but did not get very high due to injury and illness. In the fall of 1954, a French reconnaissance expedition made the first ascents of the subsidiary summits Kangchungtse (October 22: Jean Franco, Lionel Terray, sirdar Gyalzen Norbu Sherpa and Pa Norbu) and Chomo Lonzo (October 30?: Jean Couzy and Terray).[4]\n\n\n\n### First ascent[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1955 French Makalu expedition\n\nMakalu was first summited on May 15, 1955, by Lionel Terray and Jean Couzy of a French expedition led by Jean Franco. Franco, Guido Magnone and Gyalzen Norbu Sherpa summitted the next day, followed by Jean Bouvier, Serge Coupé, Pierre Leroux and André Vialatte on the 17th. This was an amazing achievement at the time, to have the vast majority of expedition members summit, especially on such a difficult peak. Prior to this time, summits were reached by one to two expedition members at most, with the rest of teams providing logistical support before turning around and heading home. The French team climbed Makalu by the north face and northeast ridge, via the saddle between Makalu and Kangchungtse (the Makalu-La), establishing the standard route.[4]\n\n\nAn ascent without oxygen was attempted by the 1960-61 Silver Hut expedition but two attempts did not succeed.\n\n\n\n### Notable ascents[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Glacier on Makalu\n![](image)Makalu\n![](image)Makalu 3D\n* 1955 *North Face to Northeast Ridge* FA by Lionel Terray and Jean Couzy of France.[4]\n* 1970: *Southeast Ridge* FA of ridge attempted by the Americans in 1954,[5] was made by Y. Ozaki and A. Tanaka from Japan on May 23.[6]\n* 1971: The very technical *West Pillar* route was climbed in May by Frenchmen B. Mellet and Y. Seigneur.[4]\n* 1975: *South Face* – an expedition led by Aleš Kunaver reached the top of Makalu up its steep southern side, becoming the first Slovenes to summit an eight-thousander. The first amongst them was Stane Belak. This was the third ascent of an eight-thousand meter peak by a great mountain face and the highest peak successfully summitted without supplementary oxygen (Marjan Manfreda).[7]\n* 1976 – South pillar route completed by Czechoslovak expedition (first attempt in 1973 ended shortly before Makalu South at 8010m due to the fatal fall of Jan Kounický). Route goes via south buttress to Makalu South and then via southeast ridge. Makalu South was climbed by 11 expedition members. Two of them – Karel Schubert and Milan Kriššák summited main summit together with Jorge Camprubi from Spanish expedition which climbed southeast ridge. Karel Schubert died after bivouac near the summit.[*citation needed*]\n* 1980: The second ascent of the *West Pillar* was completed in May by John Roskelley (summit), Chris Kopczynski, James States and Kim Momb, without Sherpa support and without bottled oxygen.[8]\n* 1981: On 15 October renowned Polish climber Jerzy Kukuczka ascended Makalu via a new route up the north-western side and north crest. Kukuczka climbed solo, in Alpine style, without supplemental oxygen.[9]\n* 1982 : On 10 October Polish climber Andrzej Czok ascended Makalu via West face till 8000m and north-western ridge. Camp IV was reached by two more climbers, Janusz Skorek and Andrzej Machnik, but when their first summit attempt failed, Czok decided to try one more time solo.[10]\n* 1988: Frenchman Marc Batard climbed in one day (after camps were set up) to the summit via the *West Buttress* on April 27.[11]\n* 1989: *Direct South Face*, solo new start by Frenchman Pierre Beghin to 1975 Yugoslav route.[12]\n* 1990: First female ascent, Kitty Calhoun via the West Pillar route.[13]\n* 1994: On May 15, the anniversary of the first summit, Anatoli Boukreev made a speed ascent in 46 hours.[*citation needed*]\n* 1997: After seven failed attempts between 1977 and 1996, the West face was finally ascended. A Russian expedition led by Sergey Efimov brought Alexei Bolotov, Yuri Ermachek, Dmitri Pavlenko, Igor Bugachevski and Nikolai Jiline to the summit.[14] This ascent won the 1998 Piolet d'Or.\n* 2006: On or about January 27 the French mountaineer Jean-Christophe Lafaille disappeared on Makalu while trying to make the first winter ascent.[15]\n* 2009: Makalu was first climbed in winter on February 9, 2009, by Italian Simone Moro and Kazakh Denis Urubko.[16][17] It was the final Nepali eight-thousander to be climbed in winter conditions. Moro had previously made the first winter ascent of Shishapangma in winter 2005 with Pole Piotr Morawski.\n* 2022: Ecuadorian Karl Egloff set a new speed record by ascending in 17 hours 18 minutes on May 8, 2022. He climbed without sherpa support and without bottled oxygen. [18]\n* 2022: Adrian Ballinger made the first ski descent, skiing from 15m below the summit to the foot of the glacier.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n![](image)\n2004 photo mosaic: the Himalayas with Makalu and Mount Everest from the International Space Station, Expedition 8.\n\n## Makalu-Barun Valley[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Makalu-Barun Valley – A glacier valley starting from the foot of the Makalu.\nMain article: Barun Valley\n\nMakalu-Barun Valley is a Himalayan glacier valley situated at the base of Makalu in the Sankhuwasabha district of Nepal.

It is located in the Mahalangur Himalayas 19 km (12 mi) southeast of Mount Everest, on the China–Nepal border. One of the eight-thousanders, Makalu is an isolated peak in the shape of a four-sided pyramid.\n\n\nMakalu has two notable subsidiary peaks. Kangchungtse, or Makalu II (7,678 m) lies about three kilometres (two miles) north-northwest of the main summit. Rising about 5 km (3 mi) north-northeast of the main summit across a broad plateau, and connected to Kangchungtse by a narrow, 7,200 m saddle, is Chomo Lonzo (7,804 m).\n\n\n\n\n## Climbing history[edit]\n\n\nThe first climb on Makalu was made by an American team led by Riley Keegan in the spring of 1954. The expedition was composed of Sierra Club members including Bill Long and Allen Steck, and was called the California Himalayan Expedition to Makalu.[3]\nThey attempted the southeast ridge but were turned back at 7,100 metres (23,300 ft) by a constant barrage of storms. A New Zealand team including Sir Edmund Hillary was also active in the spring, but did not get very high due to injury and illness. In the fall of 1954, a French reconnaissance expedition made the first ascents of the subsidiary summits Kangchungtse (October 22: Jean Franco, Lionel Terray, sirdar Gyalzen Norbu Sherpa and Pa Norbu) and Chomo Lonzo (October 30?: Jean Couzy and Terray).[4]\n\n\n\n### First ascent[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1955 French Makalu expedition\n\nMakalu was first summited on May 15, 1955, by Lionel Terray and Jean Couzy of a French expedition led by Jean Franco. Franco, Guido Magnone and Gyalzen Norbu Sherpa summitted the next day, followed by Jean Bouvier, Serge Coupé, Pierre Leroux and André Vialatte on the 17th. This was an amazing achievement at the time, to have the vast majority of expedition members summit, especially on such a difficult peak. Prior to this time, summits were reached by one to two expedition members at most, with the rest of teams providing logistical support before turning around and heading home. The French team climbed Makalu by the north face and northeast ridge, via the saddle between Makalu and Kangchungtse (the Makalu-La), establishing the standard route.[4]\n\n\nAn ascent without oxygen was attempted by the 1960-61 Silver Hut expedition but two attempts did not succeed.\n\n\n\n### Notable ascents[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Glacier on Makalu\n![](image)Makalu\n![](image)Makalu 3D\n* 1955 *North Face to Northeast Ridge* FA by Lionel Terray and Jean Couzy of France.[4]\n* 1970: *Southeast Ridge* FA of ridge attempted by the Americans in 1954,[5] was made by Y. Ozaki and A. Tanaka from Japan on May 23.[6]\n* 1971: The very technical *West Pillar* route was climbed in May by Frenchmen B. Mellet and Y. Seigneur.[4]\n* 1975: *South Face* – an expedition led by Aleš Kunaver reached the top of Makalu up its steep southern side, becoming the first Slovenes to summit an eight-thousander. The first amongst them was Stane Belak. This was the third ascent of an eight-thousand meter peak by a great mountain face and the highest peak successfully summitted without supplementary oxygen (Marjan Manfreda).[7]\n* 1976 – South pillar route completed by Czechoslovak expedition (first attempt in 1973 ended shortly before Makalu South at 8010m due to the fatal fall of Jan Kounický). Route goes via south buttress to Makalu South and then via southeast ridge. Makalu South was climbed by 11 expedition members. Two of them – Karel Schubert and Milan Kriššák summited main summit together with Jorge Camprubi from Spanish expedition which climbed southeast ridge. Karel Schubert died after bivouac near the summit.[*citation needed*]\n* 1980: The second ascent of the *West Pillar* was completed in May by John Roskelley (summit), Chris Kopczynski, James States and Kim Momb, without Sherpa support and without bottled oxygen.[8]\n* 1981: On 15 October renowned Polish climber Jerzy Kukuczka ascended Makalu via a new route up the north-western side and north crest. Kukuczka climbed solo, in Alpine style, without supplemental oxygen.[9]\n* 1982 : On 10 October Polish climber Andrzej Czok ascended Makalu via West face till 8000m and north-western ridge. Camp IV was reached by two more climbers, Janusz Skorek and Andrzej Machnik, but when their first summit attempt failed, Czok decided to try one more time solo.[10]\n* 1988: Frenchman Marc Batard climbed in one day (after camps were set up) to the summit via the *West Buttress* on April 27.[11]\n* 1989: *Direct South Face*, solo new start by Frenchman Pierre Beghin to 1975 Yugoslav route.[12]\n* 1990: First female ascent, Kitty Calhoun via the West Pillar route.[13]\n* 1994: On May 15, the anniversary of the first summit, Anatoli Boukreev made a speed ascent in 46 hours.[*citation needed*]\n* 1997: After seven failed attempts between 1977 and 1996, the West face was finally ascended. A Russian expedition led by Sergey Efimov brought Alexei Bolotov, Yuri Ermachek, Dmitri Pavlenko, Igor Bugachevski and Nikolai Jiline to the summit.[14] This ascent won the 1998 Piolet d'Or.\n* 2006: On or about January 27 the French mountaineer Jean-Christophe Lafaille disappeared on Makalu while trying to make the first winter ascent.[15]\n* 2009: Makalu was first climbed in winter on February 9, 2009, by Italian Simone Moro and Kazakh Denis Urubko.[16][17] It was the final Nepali eight-thousander to be climbed in winter conditions. Moro had previously made the first winter ascent of Shishapangma in winter 2005 with Pole Piotr Morawski.\n* 2022: Ecuadorian Karl Egloff set a new speed record by ascending in 17 hours 18 minutes on May 8, 2022. He climbed without sherpa support and without bottled oxygen. [18]\n* 2022: Adrian Ballinger made the first ski descent, skiing from 15m below the summit to the foot of the glacier.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n![](image)\n2004 photo mosaic: the Himalayas with Makalu and Mount Everest from the International Space Station, Expedition 8.\n\n## Makalu-Barun Valley[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Makalu-Barun Valley – A glacier valley starting from the foot of the Makalu.\nMain article: Barun Valley\n\nMakalu-Barun Valley is a Himalayan glacier valley situated at the base of Makalu in the Sankhuwasabha district of Nepal.
