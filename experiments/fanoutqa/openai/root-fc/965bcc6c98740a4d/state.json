The combined population of both China and India are estimated to be over 2.8 billion people as of 2022[update].\nAsia's population is projected to grow to 5.25 billion by 2055, or about 54% of projected world population at that time.[1] Population growth in Asia was close to 0.55% p.a. as of 2022[update], with highly disparate rates. Many Western Asian and South Asian countries have growth rates above world average, notably Pakistan at 2% p.a., while China had a small decrease of -0.06% and India had a 0.6% increase in 2022. \n\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Asian countries by population and List of Asian countries by life expectancy\n\n![](image)Asia population pyramid in 2023 based on the United Nations geoscheme for Asia\n### History[edit]\n\n\n#### Population of Asia, 1\u20131820 C.E.

The total fertility rate (births per woman) for Africa is 4.7 as of 2018, the highest in the world according to the World Bank.[4] The most populous African country is Nigeria with over 206 million inhabitants as of 2020 and a growth rate of 2.6% p.a.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\n### Genetics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Genetic history of Africa\n\n### History[edit]\n\n\n#### Alternative Estimates of African Population, 0\u20132018 AD (in thousands)[edit]\n\n\nSource: Maddison and others.

[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAs of 2019, the total population of Africa is estimated at 1.3 billion, representing 16 percent of the world's population.[12] According to UN estimates, the population of Africa may reach 2.49 billion by 2050 (about 26% of the world's total) and 4.28 billion by 2100 (about 39% of the world's total).[12] The number of babies born in Africa compared to the rest of the world is expected to reach approximately 37% in the year 2050.[13]\n\n\nThe population of Africa first surpassed one billion in 2009, with a doubling time of 27 years (growth rate 2.6% p.a.).[14]\n\n\nPopulation growth has continued at almost the same pace, and total population is expected to surpass 2 billion by 2038 (doubling time 29 years, 2.4% p.a.).[5]\n\n\nSub-Saharan Africa are expected to make more than half of the global population increase projected through 2050.[15]\n\n\nThe reason for the uncontrolled population growth since the mid 20th century is the decrease of infant mortality and general increase of life expectancy without a corresponding reduction in fertility rate, due to a very limited use of contraceptives. Further factors generally associated with decreased fertility include wealth, education, and female labor participation.[16] Uncontrolled population growth threatens to overwhelm infrastructure development and to cripple economic development.[17] Kenya and Zambia are pursuing programs to promote family planning in an attempt to curb growth rates.[18]\n\n\nThe extreme population growth in Africa is driven by East Africa, Middle Africa and West Africa, which regions are projected to more than quintuple their populations over the 21st century. The most extreme of these is Middle Africa, with an estimated population increase by 681%, from less than 100 million in 2000 to more than 750 million in 2100 (almost half of this figure is driven by the Democratic Republic of the Congo, projected to increase from 47 million in 2000 to 362 million in 2100). Projected population growth is less extreme in Southern Africa and North Africa, which are expected, respectively, to not quite double and triple their populations over the same period.[12]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 84.00\u201385.99\n 82.00\u201383.99\n 80.00\u201381.99\n 78.00\u201379.99\n 76.00\u201377.99\n 74.00\u201375.99\n | 72.00\u201373.99\n 70.00\u201371.99\n 68.00\u201369.99\n 66.00\u201367.99\n 64.00\u201365.99\n 62.00\u201363.99\n | 60.00\u201361.99\n 58.00\u201359.99\n 56.00\u201357.99\n 54.00\u201355.99\n 52.00\u201353.99\n no data\n |\n\n Life expectancy by region in 2021[19]\nPopulation estimates by region (in billions):\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | 2000 | 2050 | 2100\n |\n| East Africa | 0.26 | 0.85 (+227%, +1.8% p.a.) | 1.45 (+458%, +0.6% p.a.) |\n| Central Africa | 0.096 | 0.38 (+296%, +2.1% p.a.)  | 0.75 (+681%, +0.8% p.a.)  |\n| North Africa | 0.17 | 0.37 (+118%, +1.1% p.a.)  | 0.50 (+194%, +0.3% p.a.)  |\n| Southern Africa | 0.051 | 0.087 (+70%, +0.6% p.a.)  | 0.094 (+82%, -0.1% p.a.)  |\n| West Africa | 0.23 | 0.80 (+248%, +2.0% p.a.)  | 1.48 (+543%, +0.7% p.a.)  |\n| **Africa** | 0.81 | 2.49 (+207%, +1.7% p.a.)  | 4.28 (+428%, +0.6% p.a.)  |\n| **World** | 6.14 | 9.73 (+58%, +0.5% p.a.)  | 10.88 (+77%, +0.0% p.a.)  |\n\n\n## Births[edit]\n\n\nAll countries in Africa had TFRs above replacement level in 2019 and accounted for 27.1% of global livebirths.[20]\n\n\n\n## Health[edit]\n\n\n![](image)World map indicating infant mortality rates per 1000 births in 2006.[21]\nFurther information: List of African countries by life expectancy and HIV/AIDS in Africa\n\n### History of health care development in sub-Saharan Africa[edit]\n\n\nIn September 1987, UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Committee announced the launching of the Bamako Initiative\u2014 chartered in response to financial issues occurring in the region during the 1980s, and with the aim of increasing access to vital medications through community involvement in revolving drug funds.[22][23] The 1987 Bamako Initiative conference, organized by the WHO was held in Bamako, the capital of Mali, and helped reshape the health policy of sub-Saharan Africa.[24] The meeting was attended by African Ministers of Health who advocated for improvement of healthcare access through the revitalization of primary healthcare.[22][23] The new strategy substantially increased accessibility through community-based healthcare reform, resulting in more efficient and equitable provision of services. The public health community within the region raised issues in response to the initiative, of which included: equity, access, affordability, integration issues, relative importance given to medications, management, dependency, logistics, and sustainability.[22] As a result of these critiques, the Initiative later transformed to address the increase of accessibility of health services, the enhancement of quality of health services, and the overall improvement of health system management.[22] A comprehensive approach strategy was extended to all areas of health care, with subsequent improvement in the health care indicators and improvement in health care efficiency and cost.[25][26]\n\n\n\n### Major health challenges[edit]\n\n\nThe Eastern African, Central African, Western African and Southern African regions experience disproportionate rates of infectious and chronic diseases in comparison to other global regions.[27]\n\n\n\n#### Diabetes[edit]\n\n\nType 2 diabetes persists as an epidemic in the region posing a public health and socioeconomic crisis for Sub-Saharan Africa. Scarcity of data for pathogenesis and subtypes for diabetes in Sub-Saharan African communities has led to gaps in documenting epidemiology for the disease. High rates of undiagnosed diabetes in many countries leaves individuals at a high risk of chronic health complications, thus, posing a high risk of diabetes-related morbidity and mortality in the region.[28]\n\n\n\n#### HIV/AIDS[edit]\n\n\nIn 2011, Africa was home to 69% of all people living with HIV/AIDS worldwide.[29] In response, a number of initiatives have been launched to educate the public on HIV/AIDS. Among these are combination prevention programmes, considered to be the most effective initiative, the abstinence, be faithful, use a condom campaign, and the Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation's outreach programs.[30] According to a 2013 special report issued by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), the number of HIV positive people in Africa receiving anti-retroviral treatment in 2012 was over seven times the number receiving treatment in 2005, with an almost 1 million added in the last year alone.[31][32] The number of AIDS-related deaths in Sub-Saharan Africa in 2011 was 33 percent less than the number in 2005.[33] The number of new HIV infections in sub-Saharan Africa in 2011 was 25 percent less than the number in 2001.[33]\n\n\n\n#### Malaria[edit]\n\n\nMalaria is an endemic illness in Sub-Saharan Africa, where the majority of malaria cases and deaths worldwide occur.[34]\n\n\n\n#### Maternal and infant mortality[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of countries by fertility rate (2020), according to the Population Reference Bureau\nStudies show that more than half of the world's maternal deaths occur in Sub-Saharan Africa.[35][36] However progress has been made in this area, as maternal mortality rates have decreased for multiple countries in the region by about half since 1990.[36] Additionally, the African Union ratified the Maputo Protocol in July 2003, which pledges to prohibit female genital mutilation.[37]\n\n\nThe Sub-Saharan African region alone accounts for about 45% of global infant and child mortalities. Studies have shown a relationship between infant survival and the education of mothers, as years of education positively correlate with infant survival rates. Geographic location is also a factor, as child mortality rates are higher in rural areas in comparison to urban regions.[38]\n\n\n\n#### Measles[edit]\n\n\nRoutine immunization has been introduced to countries within Sub-Saharan Africa in order to prevent measles outbreaks within the region.[39]\n\n\n\n#### Neglected tropical diseases[edit]\n\n\nNeglected tropical diseases such as hookworm infection encompass some of the most common health conditions which affect an estimated 500 million individuals in the sub-Saharan African region.[40]\n\n\n\n#### Non-communicable diseases[edit]\n\n\nResults of Global Burden of Disease studies reveal that the age-standardized death rates of non-communicable diseases in at least four Sub-Saharan countries including South Africa, Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria, and Ethiopia supersede that of identified high-income countries.[27] Improvement in statistics systems and increase in epidemiological studies with in-depth analysis of disease risk factors could improve the understanding of non-communicable diseases (i.e.: diabetes, hypertension, cancer, cardiovascular disease, obesity, etc.) in sub-Saharan Africa as well as better inform decisions surrounding healthcare policy in the region.[27]\n\n\n\n#### Onchocerciasis[edit]\n\n\nOnchocerciasis (\"river blindness\"), a common cause of blindness, is also endemic to parts of the region. More than 99% of people affected by the illness worldwide live in 31 countries therein.[41] In response, the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC) was launched in 1995 with the aim of controlling the disease.[41]\n\n\n\n#### Tuberculosis[edit]\n\n\nTuberculosis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality on a global scale, especially in high HIV-prevalent populations in the sub-Saharan African region, with a high case fatality rate.[42]\n\n\n\n### National healthcare systems[edit]\n\n\nNational health systems vary between countries. In Ghana, most health care is provided by the government and largely administered by the Ministry of Health and Ghana Health Services. The healthcare system has five levels of providers: health posts which are first level primary care for rural areas, health centers and clinics, district hospitals, regional hospitals and tertiary hospitals. These programs are funded by the government of Ghana, financial credits, Internally Generated Fund (IGF), and Donors-pooled Health Fund.[43]\n\n\nA shortage of health professionals compounded by migration of health workers from sub-Saharan Africa to other parts of the world (namely English-speaking nations such as the United States and the United Kingdom) has negatively impacted productivity and efficacy of the region's health systems.[44]\n\n\n\nMore than 85% of individuals in Africa use traditional medicine as an alternative to often expensive allopathic medical health care and costly pharmaceutical products. The Organization of African Unity (OAU) Heads of State and Government declared the 2000s decade as the African Decade on African Traditional Medicine in an effort to promote The WHO African Region\u2019s adopted resolution for institutionalizing traditional medicine in health care systems across the continent.[45] Public policy makers in the region are challenged with consideration of the importance of traditional/indigenous health systems and whether their coexistence with the modern medical and health sub-sector would improve the equitability and accessibility of health care distribution, the health status of populations, and the social-economic development of nations within sub-Saharan Africa.[46] \n\n* ![Map of Africa colored according to the percentage of the adult (ages 15\u201349) population with HIV/AIDS (Map of 2002).[47]](image)\n\nMap of Africa colored according to the percentage of the adult (ages 15\u201349) population with HIV/AIDS (Map of 2002).[47]\n* ![Life expectancy has fallen drastically in Southern Africa a result of HIV/AIDS.[48]](image)\n\nLife expectancy has fallen drastically in Southern Africa a result of HIV/AIDS.[48]\n\n\n## Ethnicity[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of ethnic groups of Africa\n\nFurther information: Languages of Africa\n![](image)Yoruba drummers in Kwara State, Nigeria (2004).\n![](image)Beja nomads from Northeast AfricaSpeakers of Bantu languages (part of the Niger\u2013Congo family) predominate in southern, central and southeast Africa. The Bantu farmers from West Africa's inland savanna progressively expanded over most of Africa.[49] But there are also several Nilotic groups in South Sudan and East Africa, the mixed Swahili people on the Swahili Coast, and a few remaining indigenous Khoisan (San and Khoikhoi) and Pygmy peoples in southern and central Africa, respectively. Native Bantu-speaking Africans also predominate in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea, and are found in parts of southern Cameroon. In the Kalahari Desert of Southern Africa, the distinct people known as the \"San\" have long been present. Together with the Khoikhoi, they form the Khoisan. The San are the pre-Bantu indigenous people of southern Africa, while Pygmies are the pre-Bantu indigenous African peoples of Central Africa.[50]\n\n\nThe peoples of West Africa primarily speak Niger\u2013Congo languages belonging mostly, though not exclusively, to its non-Bantu branches, though some Nilo-Saharan and Afroasiatic-speaking groups are also found. The Niger\u2013Congo-speaking Yoruba, Igbo, Fulani, Akan and Wolof ethnic groups are the largest and most influential. In the central Sahara, Mandinka or Mande groups are most significant. Chadic-speaking groups, including the Hausa, are found in the more northerly parts of the region nearest to the Sahara and Nilo-Saharan communities such as the Kanuri,[51][52] Zarma[52] and Songhai[52][53] are present in eastern parts of West Africa bordering Central Africa.\n\n\n\nThe peoples of North Africa comprise three main groups: Berbers in the northwest, Egyptians and Libyans in northeast, and Nilo-Saharan-speaking peoples in the east. The non-native Muslim settlers who arrived in the 7th century introduced the Arabic language and Islam to the region, initiating a process of linguistic Arabization of the region's inhabitants. The Semitic Phoenicians (who founded Carthage) and Hyksos, the Indo-Iranian Alans, the Indo-European Greeks, Romans and Vandals settled in North Africa as well.\n\nFile:Xhosa.jpgXhosa people from South AfricaBerber-speaking populations still make significant communities within Morocco and Algeria and are still also present in smaller numbers in Tunisia and Libya.[54] The Berber-speaking Tuareg and other often-nomadic peoples are the principal inhabitants of the Saharan interior of North Africa. In Mauritania, there is a small Berber community and Niger\u2013Congo-speaking peoples in the South, though in both regions Arabic and Arab culture predominates. In Sudan, although Arabic and Arab culture predominates, it is also inhabited by originally Nilo-Saharan-speaking groups such as the Nubians, Fur, Masalit and Zaghawa[55] who over the centuries have variously intermixed with migrants from the Arabian peninsula. Small communities of Afro-Asiatic-speaking Beja nomads can also be found in Egypt and Sudan.\n\n![](image)Mongo family in the Province of \u00c9quateur, DRCIn the Horn of Africa, Afro-Asiatic-speaking groups predominate. Ethiopian and Eritrean groups like the Amhara and Tigrayans (collectively known as Habesha) speak languages from the Semitic branch of Afro-Asiatic language family, while the Oromo and Somali speak languages from the Cushitic branch of Afro-Asiatic. In southern Ethiopia and Eritrea, Nilotic peoples related to those in South Sudan are also found, while Bantu and Khoisan ethnic minorities inhabit parts of southern Somalia near the Kenyan border.\n\n![](image)San man from Botswana.Prior to the decolonization movements of the post-World War II era, Europeans were represented in every part of Africa.[56] Decolonisation during the 1960s and 1970s often resulted in the mass emigration of European-descended settlers out of Africa\u00a0\u2013 especially from Algeria and Morocco (1.6 million *pieds-noirs* in North Africa),[57] Kenya, Congo,[58] Rhodesia, Mozambique and Angola.[59] By the end of 1977, more than one million Portuguese were thought to have returned from Africa.[60] Nevertheless, European Africans remain a minority in many African states, particularly South Africa, Zimbabwe, Namibia and R\u00e9union.[61] The African country with the largest native European African population is South Africa.[62] The Boers or Afrikaners, the British diaspora and the Coloureds (multiracial) are the largest European-descended groups in Africa today.\n\n\n![](image)Afrikaner children in Namibia\n![](image)Narendra Modi greeting members of the Indian community in Nairobi, Kenya\n![](image)A Coloured family in Cape Town, South Africa\nEuropean colonization also brought sizable groups of Asians, particularly people from the Indian subcontinent, to British colonies. Large Indian communities are found in South Africa, and smaller ones are present in Kenya, Tanzania, and some other southern and East African countries. The large Indian community in Uganda was expelled by the dictator Idi Amin in 1972, though many have since returned. The islands in the Indian Ocean are also populated primarily by people of Asian origin, often mixed with Africans and Europeans. The Malagasy people of Madagascar are Austronesian people and native African people, but those along the coast are generally mixed with Bantu, Arab, Indian and European origins. Malay and Indian ancestries are also important components in the group of people known in South Africa as Cape Coloureds (people with origins in two or more races and continents). Beginning with the 21st century many Hispanics, primarily Mexicans, Central Americans, Chileans, Peruvians, and Colombians, have immigrated to Africa. Around 500,000 Hispanics have immigrated to Africa, most of whom live in South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria, Uganda, and Ghana. During the 20th century, small but economically important communities of Lebanese and Chinese[63] have also developed in the larger coastal cities of West and East Africa, respectively.[64]\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n## Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Africa\n\n![Ethnic groups in Africa](image)1996 map of the major ethnolinguistic groups of Africa, by the Library of Congress Geography and Map Division (substantially based on G.P.

The Afroasiatic homeland may be either in Western Asia or in Africa.\n\n\nMore recently introduced to Africa are Austronesian languages spoken in Madagascar, as well as Indo-European languages spoken in South Africa and Namibia (Afrikaans, English, German), which were used as lingua francas in former European colonies.\n\n\nThe total number of languages natively spoken in Africa is variously estimated (depending on the delineation of language vs. dialect) at between 1,250 and 2,100,[65] and by some counts at \"over 3,000\",[66] Nigeria alone has over 500 languages (according to the count of SIL Ethnologue),[67]\n\n\nAround a hundred languages are widely used for inter-ethnic communication. Arabic, Somali, Berber, Amharic, Oromo, Igbo, Swahili, Hausa, Manding, Fulani and Yoruba are spoken by tens of millions of people. Twelve dialect clusters (which may group up to a hundred linguistic varieties) are spoken by 75 percent, and fifteen by 85 percent, of Africans as a first or additional language.[68]\n\n\nNiger\u2013Congo is the largest phylum of African languages, with more than 500 million speakers (2017); it is dominated by the Bantu branch, spread throughout sub-Saharan Africa in the Bantu expansion, Bantu speakers accounting for about half of Niger\u2013Congo speakers. Arabic is the most widely spoken single language in Africa by far, with a population of Arab Africa of the order of 330 million (2017). Other Afroasiatic languages are spoken by of the order of 100 million speakers in Africa (2017). Nilo-Saharan are spoken by of the order of 100 million speakers (2017). Khoisan groups a number of mostly endangered click languages, the largest being Khoekhoe with of the order of 300,000 speakers (2016).\n\n\nFormer colonial languages, such as English, French and Portuguese, are used as official languages in many African nations, and are spoken by a fifth of Africans.[69][70][71][a]\n\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Religion in Africa, Traditional African religions, Islam in Africa, and Christianity in Africa\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![map](image)Africa portal\n\n\n* List of ethnic groups of Africa\n* Africa\n* Demographics of the world\n* Capoid\n* Congoid\n* Linguistic demographics of Africa\n* List of countries by fertility rate\n* Child marriage in Africa\n* Poverty in Africa\n* World population\n* Youth in Africa\n* Culture of Africa\n* Religion in Africa\n* Demographics of the Middle East and North Africa\n* Genetic history of Africa\n* Genetic history of North Africa\n* History of Africa\n\n\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n* African cities total fertility rate\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The previous three references show that there a total of 130 million English speakers, 120 million French speakers, and over 30 million Portuguese speakers in Africa, making them about 20% of Africa's 2022 population of 1.4 billion people.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Zinkina J., Korotayev A.

Precipitous declines in fertility in Asia and Latin America, from five children per woman in the 1970s to around 2.5 today, led many to believe Africa would follow a similar course. [...] Unfortunately, since the early 1990s, family planning programmes in Africa have not had the same attention [as in other parts of the world], resulting in slow, sometimes negligible, fertility declines. In a handful of countries, previous declines have stalled altogether and are reversing. [...] A few heroic efforts, such as Family Planning 2020, are attempting to stimulate family planning programmes across the continent, and there are some signs of success. Recent figures from Kenya and Zambia show substantial strengthening of contraceptive use among married women. In Kenya, 58% of married women now use modern contraception, and in Zambia this measure has risen from 33% to 45% in the last three years. In both cases, the catalysts for improvements were government commitment and commensurate budget financing. The virtuous circle may not be completely out of reach, but many more African governments must make haste and make substantial investments in contraceptive information and access for their people.\"\n19. **^** \"Life expectancy at birth, total\".

In 2018, Europe had a total population of over 751 million people.[1][2] Russia is the most populous country in Europe, with a population of 146 million. (The population of Siberia and the Asian part of Turkey are not counted.)\n\n\nEurope's population growth is low, and its median age high. Most of Europe is in a mode of sub-replacement fertility, which means that each new(-born) generation is less populous than the one before.[3] Nonetheless, most West European countries still have growing populations, mainly due to immigration within Europe and from outside Europe and some due to increases in life expectancy and population momentum. Some current and past factors in European demography have included emigration, ethnic relations, economic immigration, a declining birth rate and an ageing population.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: World population estimates \u00a7\u00a0By world region\n\nSee also: Medieval demography\n\nAccording to Volker Heyd, an archaeologist at the University of Helsinki, up to 7 million people lived in Europe in 3000 BC.[4]\n\n\nEstimates for historical population sizes of Europe (including Central Asia, listed under \"former USSR\") based on Maddison (2007),[5] in millions, with estimated percentage of world population:\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation of Europe, in millions, by year[*citation needed*]\n| Year\n | Population(% of world total)\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| AD 1\n | 34 (15%)\n |\n| 1000\n | 40 (15%)\n |\n| 1500\n | 78 (18%)\n |\n| 1600\n | 112 (20%)\n |\n| 1700\n | 127 (21%)\n |\n| 1820\n | 224 (21%)\n |\n| 1913\n | 498 (28%)\n |\n| 2000\n | 742 (13%)\n |\n\n\n### Historical population of Europe and former USSR within modern state boundaries, AD 1\u20132020[edit]\n\n\nSource: Maddison and others (University of Groningen)[6]\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation by year (in thousands)\n| Country/region\n | 1\n | 1000\n | 1500\n | 1600\n | 1700\n | 1820\n | 1870\n | 1913\n | 1950\n | 1973\n | 1998[6] | 2020\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Austria | 500 | 700 | 2000 | 2500 | 2500 | 3369 | 4520 | 6767 | 6935 | 7586 | 8078 | 8901 |\n| Belgium | 300 | 400 | 1400 | 1600 | 2000 | 3424 | 5096 | 7666 | 8640 | 9738 | 10197 | 11493 |\n| Denmark | 180 | 360 | 600 | 650 | 700 | 1155 | 1888 | 2983 | 4269 | 5022 | 5303 | 5823 |\n| Finland | 20 | 40 | 300 | 400 | 400 | 1169 | 1754 | 3027 | 4009 | 4666 | 5153 | 5536 |\n| France | 5000 | 6500 | 15000 | 18500 | 21471 | 31246 | 38440 | 41463 | 41836 | 52118 | 58805 | 67287 |\n| Germany | 3000 | 3500 | 12000 | 16000 | 15000 | 24905 | 39231 | 65058 | 68371 | 78956 | 82029 | 83191 |\n| Italy | 7000 | 5000 | 10500 | 13100 | 13300 | 20176 | 27888 | 37248 | 47105 | 54751 | 57592 | 59258 |\n| Netherlands | 200 | 300 | 950 | 1500 | 1900 | 2355 | 3615 | 6164 | 10114 | 13438 | 15700 | 17425 |\n| Norway | 100 | 200 | 300 | 400 | 500 | 970 | 1735 | 2447 | 3265 | 3961 | 4432 | 5368 |\n| Sweden | 200 | 400 | 550 | 760 | 1260 | 2585 | 4164 | 5621 | 7015 | 8137 | 8851 | 10379 |\n| Switzerland | 300 | 300 | 650 | 1000 | 1200 | 1829 | 2664 | 3864 | 4694 | 6441 | 7130 | 8667 |\n| United Kingdom | 800 | 2000 | 3942 | 6170 | 8565 | 21226 | 31393 | 45649 | 50363 | 56223 | 59237 | 67886 |\n| Portugal | 500 | 600 | 1000 | 1100 | 2000 | 3297 | 4353 | 6004 | 8512 | 8634 | 9968 | 10305 |\n| Spain | 4500 | 4000 | 6800 | 8240 | 8770 | 12203 | 16201 | 20263 | 27868 | 34810 | 39371 | 47431 |\n| Greece | 2000 | 1000 | 1000 | 1500 | 1500 | 2312 |  |  | 7554 | 8929 | 10835 | 10689 |\n| 13 small countries\n | 100 | 113 | 276 | 358 | 394 | 657 |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Total Western Europe\n | 24700 | 25413 | 57268 | 73778 | 81460 | 132888 | 187532 | 261007 | 305060 | 358390 | 388399 | 419639 |\n| Albania | 200 | 200 | 200 | 200 | 300 | 437 |  |  | 1215 | 2296 | 3108 | 2878 |\n| Bulgaria | 500 | 800 | 800 | 1250 | 1250 | 2187 |  | 4200 | 7251 | 8621 | 8257 | 6917 |\n| Czechoslovakia | 1000 | 1250 | 3000 | 4500 | 4500 | 7190 |  |  | 12393 | 14563 | 15686 | 16366 |\n| -

The precise figure depends on the exact definition of the geographic extent of Europe. The population of the European Union (EU) was 509 million as of 2015.[10] Non-EU countries situated in Europe in their entirety[11] account for another 90 million. Five transcontinental countries[12] have a total of 247 million people, of which about half reside in Europe proper.\n\n\nAs it stands now, around 10% of the world's people live in Europe. If demographic trends keep their pace, its share may fall to around 7% in 2050, but still amounting to 716 million people in absolute numbers, according to the United Nations estimate.[9] (The decline in the percentage is partly due to high fertility rates in Africa and South America.) The sub-replacement fertility and high life expectancy in most European states mean a declining and aging population. High immigration and emigration levels within and from outside the continent are taking place and quickly changing countries, specifically in Western Europe, from a single ethnic group to a multicultural society. These trends change societies' economies as well as their political and social institutions.

expectancy, European countries tend to have older populations overall.

The EU countries with the highest rates were France (1.83 live births per woman), Romania (1.80) and Czechia (1.71). The lowest rates were found in Malta (1.13), Spain (1.19) and Italy (1.24).[16]\n\n\nThe reasons that Italian citizens give for not having children are economic costs, fear of losing their jobs, and lack of services for families.[17]\n\n\nEurostat says that the proportion of children born to foreign mothers, including both from other EU member states and from non-EU countries, has been increasing in the EU since 2013 and stood at 21% in 2020.[16]\n\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Europe\n\nFurther information: Christianity in Europe and Islam in Europe\n\nOver the last several centuries, religious practice has been on the decline in a process of secularization. Several European countries have experienced a decline in church attendance as well as a decline in the number of people professing a religious belief. The 2010 Eurobarometer survey found that, on average, 51% of the citizens of the European Union that they believe there is a God, 26% believe there is some sort of spirit or life force and 20% don't believe there is any sort of spirit, God or life force. 3% declined to answer.[18] The Eurobarometer survey must be taken with caution, however, as there are discrepancies between it and national census results. For example, in the United Kingdom, the 2001 census revealed that over 70% of the population regarded themselves as \"Christians\" with only 15% professing to have no religion, though the wording of the question has been criticized as \"misleading\" by the British Humanist Association.[19] The 2011 census showed a dramatic reduction to less than 60% of the population regarding themselves as \"Christians\".[20]\n\n\nDespite its decline, Christianity is still the largest religion in Europe. According to a survey published in 2010, 76.2% of Europeans identified themselves as Christians.[21][22] Catholics were the largest Christian group in Europe, accounting for more than 48% of European Christians.[23] The second-largest Christian group in Europe was the Orthodox, who made up 32% of European Christians.[23] And about 19% of European Christians were part of the Protestant tradition. Europe constitutes in absolute terms the world's largest Christian population.[24] According to Scholars, in 2017, Europe's population was 77.8% Christian (up from 74.9% 1970),[25][26] these changes were largely result of the collapse of Communism and switching to Christianity in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries.[25]\n\n\nAccording to a 2003 study,[27] 47% of French people declared themselves as agnostics in 2003. This situation is often called \"Post-Christian Europe\". A decrease in religiousness and church attendance in western Europe (especially in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Norway, the Netherlands and Sweden) has been noted. According to a survey published in 2012, atheists and agnostics make up about 18.2% of the European population.[28] According to the same survey the religiously unaffiliated make up the majority of the population only in two European countries: Czech Republic (75%) and Estonia (60%).[28]\n\n\nAccording to another survey about Religiosity in the European Union from 2012 by Eurobarometer, Christianity was the largest religion in the Union (accounting for 72% of the total population), Catholics were with 48% the largest Christian group in the Union, Protestants made up 12%, Eastern Orthodox made up 8% and other Christians accounted for 4% of the total population.[29] non-believers/agnostics accounted for 16%, atheists accounted for 7% and Muslims accounted for 2%.[30]\n\n\n\n## Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ethnic groups in Europe\n\nFurther information: White people and Immigration to Europe\n\nPan and Pfeil (2004) count 87 distinct \"**peoples of Europe**\", of which 33 form the majority population in at least one sovereign state, while the remaining 54 constitute ethnic minorities. The total number of national minority populations in Europe is estimated at 105 million people, or 14% of 770 million Europeans. (including Europeans in Siberia)[31]\n\n\nThe largest ethnic groups are the Russians, with 117 million, and the Germans, with 72 million. In some countries such as the United Kingdom, France and Spain, the designation of nationality may controversially take on ethnic aspects, subsuming smaller ethnic groups such as Scots, Welsh, Cornish, Northern Irish, Bretons, Catalans, and Basques, making it difficult to quantify a \"British\" or \"French\" ethnicity, for example.\n\n\nApproximately 20 million non-Europeans live in the EU, 4% of the overall population.[32] There are an estimated 10 million Romani people in Europe.[33]\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nOverview map of the peoples of Europe\n |\n| --- |\n| Size and geographic distribution of the 87 peoples of Europe, according to Pan & Pfeil (2003).[34]\nFont size reflects population size (groups smaller than 2 million not to scale)\nGroups not shown due to lack of geographic concentration: Romani (3.8 million), Jews (1.3 million), Karaim (4,600).

This family is divided into a number of branches, including Romance, Germanic, Baltic, Slavic, Albanian, Celtic, Armenian and Greek. The Uralic languages, which include Hungarian, Finnish, Estonian, Udmurt, Mordvin and Sami also have a significant presence in Europe. The Turkic family also has several European members, while the North Caucasian and Kartvelian families which include Georgian, Circassian, Chechen and Abkhaz anong others are important in the southeastern extremity of geographical Europe. The Basque language of the western Pyrenees is an isolate unrelated to any other group, while Maltese is the only Semitic language in Europe with national language status, although Arabic, Hebrew and Assyrian Neo-Aramaic/Syriac are spoken by migrant populations. The Kalmyk language, is an Mongolic language, spoken in Kalmykia, located directly north of the North Caucasus in Eastern Europe. The most spoken language of Europe is Russian, which belongs to the group of Slavic languages.\n\n\nLanguages that are not official state languages are protected in many European countries by the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. These can include languages spoken by relatively many people, such as Catalan and Basque in Spain, Frisian in the Netherlands, as well as languages spoken by relatively few such as Cornish Manx and Scottish Gaelic in the United Kingdom, and Romansch in Switzerland.\n\n\n\n## Genetic origins[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Genetic history of Europe\n\nSee also: Caucasian race\n\n![](image)Bronze Age spread of Yamnaya Steppe pastoralist ancestry. The Yamnaya culture is identified with the late Proto-Indo-Europeans.\n*Homo sapiens* appeared in Europe roughly 40,000 years ago, with the settlement of the Cro-Magnons, followed by European hunter-gatherers and Early European Farmers (EEF). Over the prehistoric period there was continuous settlement in Europe, notably by the immediate descendants of the Proto-Indo-Europeans who migrated west after the advent of the Neolithic revolution.[35]\n\n\n\n### Mitochondrial DNA and Y-chromosome DNA[edit]\n\n\nStudies of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have suggested substantial genetic homogeneity of European populations,[36] with only a few geographic or linguistic isolates appearing to be genetic isolates as well.[37] On the other hand, analyses of the Y chromosome[38][39] and of autosomal diversity[40] have shown a general gradient of genetic similarity running from the southeast to the northwest of the continent.\n\n\n\n### Autosomal DNA[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Population genomic PCA map, showing Europeans (CEU) among other sampled Eurasian populations[41]\nAccording to geneticist David Reich, based on ancient human genomes that his laboratory sequenced in 2016, Europeans formed from four West-Eurasian ancestral components in varying degrees: Western Hunter-Gatherers (WHG), Eastern Hunter-Gatherers (EHG), Neolithic Levant farmers and Neolithic Iranian farmers respectively.[42]\n\n\n\n### Population structure[edit]\n\n\nA study in May 2009[43] that examined 19 populations from Europe using 270,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) highlighted the genetic diversity of European populations corresponding to the northwest to southeast gradient and distinguished \"several distinct regions\" within Europe:\n\n\n\n* Finland\n* the Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania), western Russia and Poland\n* Central and Western Europe\n* Italy, South-Eastern Europe, Southern Russia\n\n\nIn this study, Fst (fixation index) was found to correlate considerably with geographic distances ranging from \u22640.0010 for neighbouring populations to 0.0230 for Southern Italy and Finland. For comparisons, pair-wise Fst of non-European samples were as follows: Europeans \u2013 Yoruba (West Africans) 0.1530; Europeans \u2013 Chinese 0.1100; Yoruba (West Africans) \u2013 Chinese 0.1900.[43]:\u200aTable S2\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Area and population of European countries\n* Classical demography\n* Demographics of the European Union\n* Ethnic groups in Europe\n* European diasporas\n* European Union statistics\n* Migration from Latin America to Europe\n* List of cities in the European Union by population within city limits\n* List of urban areas of the European Union\n* List of European countries by population growth rate\n* List of European countries by population\n* List of metropolitan areas in Europe\n* Medieval demography\n* Demographics of the world\n* List of countries by fertility rate\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n**^**\u00a0**a:**\u00a0Continental regions as per UN categorisations/map.

There are also large cities in the Caribbean. The largest cities in North America, by far, are Mexico City and New York City. These cities are the only cities on the continent to exceed eight million, and two of three in the Americas. Next in size are Los Angeles, Toronto,[125] Chicago, Havana, Santo Domingo, and Montreal. Cities in the Sun Belt regions of the U.S., such as those in Southern California and Houston, Phoenix, Miami, Atlanta, and Las Vegas, are experiencing rapid growth. These causes included warm temperatures, retirement of Baby Boomers, large industry, and the influx of immigrants.

For example, small Caribbean island-nations, such as Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago, and Antigua and Barbuda, have a higher GDP (PPP) per capita than Mexico due to their smaller populations. Panama and Costa Rica have a significantly higher Human Development Index and GDP than the rest of the Central American nations.[91] Additionally, despite Greenland's vast resources in oil and minerals, much of them remain untapped, and the island is economically dependent on fishing, tourism, and subsidies from Denmark. Nevertheless, the island is highly developed.[92]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n110. **^** \"America's Changing Religious Landscape\". The Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life. 12 May 2015.

Greenland, a self-governing Danish island, and the world's largest, is on the same tectonic plate (the North American Plate) and is part of North America geographically. In a geologic sense, Bermuda is not part of the Americas, but an oceanic island that was formed on the fissure of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge over 100 million years ago (mya).

Economic regions include several regions formalized in 20th and 21st century trade agreements, including NAFTA between Canada, Mexico, and the United States, and CAFTA between Central America, the Dominican Republic, and the United States.\n\n\nNorth America is divided linguistically and culturally into two primary regions, Anglo-America and Latin America.

Danish is prevalent in Greenland alongside Greenlandic, and Dutch is spoken side by side local languages in the Dutch Caribbean. The term Anglo-America is used to refer to the anglophone countries of the Americas: namely Canada (where English and French are co-official) and the U.S., but also sometimes Belize and parts of the tropics, especially the Commonwealth Caribbean. Latin America refers to the other areas of the Americas (generally south of the U.S.) where the Romance languages, derived from Latin, of Spanish and Portuguese, (but French-speaking countries are not usually included) predominate: the other republics of Central America (but not always Belize), part of the Caribbean (not the Dutch-, English-, or French-speaking areas), Mexico, and most of South America (except Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana [France], and the Falkland Islands [UK]).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe continent can be divided into four great regions (each of which contains many subregions): the Great Plains stretching from the Gulf of Mexico to the Canadian Arctic; the geologically young, mountainous west, including the Rocky Mountains, the Great Basin, California and Alaska; the raised but relatively flat plateau of the Canadian Shield in the northeast; and the varied eastern region, which includes the Appalachian Mountains, the coastal plain along the Atlantic seaboard, and the Florida peninsula. Mexico, with its long plateaus and cordilleras, falls largely in the western region, although the eastern coastal plain does extend south along the Gulf.\n\n\nThe western mountains are split in the middle into the main range of the Rockies and the coast ranges in California, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia, with the Great Basin\u2014a lower area containing smaller ranges and low-lying deserts\u2014in between. The highest peak is Denali in Alaska.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe southern portion of North America includes Central America and non-English speaking Caribbean nations.[26][27] The north of the continent maintains recognized regions as well. In contrast to the common definition of North America, which encompasses the whole North American continent, the term \"North America\" is sometimes used more narrowly to refer only to four nations, Canada, Greenland, Mexico, and the U.S.[28][29][30][31][32]\n\n\nThe term Northern America refers to the northernmost countries and territories of North America: the U.S., Bermuda, Canada, Greenland, and St. Pierre and Miquelon.[33][34] Although the term does not refer to a unified region,[35] Middle America includes Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean.[36]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* North America web resources provided by GovPubs at the University of Colorado Boulder Libraries\n* North America at the *Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica*\n* North America: Human Geography at the National Geographic Society\n* European Colonization of North America at the National Geographic Society\n* North America at Curlie\n* \"North America\"\u00a0. *Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica*.

Upon Europeans' arrival in the \"New World\", indigenous peoples had a variety of reactions, including curiosity, trading, cooperation, resignation, and resistance. The indigenous population declined substantially following European arrival, primarily due to the introduction of Eurasian diseases, such as smallpox, to which the indigenous peoples lacked immunity, and because of violent conflicts with Europeans.[88] Indigenous culture changed significantly and their affiliation with political and cultural groups also changed. Several linguistic groups died out, and others changed quite quickly.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n59. **^** \"Digging for Diamonds 24/7 Under Frozen Snap Lake\". *Wired*.

In 1507, Waldseem\u00fcller published a world map, and placed the word \"America\" on the continent of present-day South America.[12] The continent north of present-day Mexico was then referred to as Parias.[13] On a 1553 world map published by Petrus Apianus,[14] North America was called \"Baccalearum\", meaning \"realm of the Cod fish\", in reference to the abundance of cod fish on the East Coast.[15]\n\n\nWaldseem\u00fcller used the Latin version of Vespucci's name, Americus Vespucius, in its feminine form of \"America\", following the examples of \"Europa\", \"Asia\", and \"Africa\".

Trade volume has steadily increased annually and in 2010, surface trade between the three NAFTA nations reached an all-time historical increase of 24.3% or US$791 billion.[149] The NAFTA trade bloc GDP (PPP) is the world's largest with US$17.617 trillion.[150] This is in part attributed to the fact that the economy of the U.S. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIts magnetic anomalies are very similar to the Sudbury Basin, and so it could be a second metal-rich impact crater.[60] The Shield is also covered by vast boreal forests that support an important logging industry.\n\n\n\n#### United States[edit]\n\n\nMain article: United States\n\nThe lower 48 U.S. states can be divided into roughly five physiographic provinces:\n\n\n\n1.

From the Late Paleozoic to Early Mesozoic eras, North America was joined with the other modern-day continents as part of the supercontinent Pangaea, with Eurasia to its east. One of the results of the formation of Pangaea was the Appalachian Mountains, which formed some 480 mya, making it among the oldest mountain ranges in the world. When Pangaea began to rift around 200 mya, North America became part of Laurasia, before it separated from Eurasia as its own continent during the mid-Cretaceous period.[54] The Rockies and other western mountain ranges began forming around this time from a period of mountain building called the Laramide orogeny, between 80 and 55 mya. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n142. **^** \"World Economic Outlook Database, October 2010\".

After decades of work, the Panama Canal was completed, which connected the Atlantic and Pacific oceans in 1913 and greatly facilitated global shipping navigation.\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of North American countries by population and List of North American countries by life expectancy\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGreenland has experienced many immigration waves from Northern Canada, e.g. the Thule people.

In 1976 Guatemala was hit by a major earthquake, killing 23,000 people; Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, was devastated by earthquakes in 1931 and 1972, the last one killing about 5,000 people; three earthquakes devastated El Salvador, one in 1986 and two in 2001; one earthquake devastated northern and central Costa Rica in 2009, killing at least 34 people; in Honduras a powerful earthquake killed seven people in 2009.\n\n\nVolcanic eruptions are common in the region. In 1968 the Arenal Volcano, in Costa Rica, erupted and killed 87 people. Fertile soils from weathered volcanic lavas have made it possible to sustain dense populations in agriculturally productive highland areas.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLatino culture is strong in the southwest of the U.S., as well as Florida, which draws Latin Americans from many countries in the hemisphere. Northern Mexico, particularly in the cities of Monterrey, Tijuana, Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, and Mexicali, is strongly influenced by the culture and way of life of the U.S. Monterrey, a modern city with a significant industrial group, has been regarded as the most Americanized city in Mexico.[159] Northern Mexico, the Western U.S. and Alberta, Canada share a cowboy culture.\n\n\nThe Anglophone Caribbean states have witnessed and participated in the decline of the British Empire and its influence on the region, and its replacement by the economic influence of Northern America in the Anglophone Caribbean. This is partly due to the relatively small populations of the English-speaking Caribbean countries, and also because many of them now have more people living abroad than those remaining at home.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPrior to the arrival of European explorers and colonists in North America, the natives of North America were divided into many different polities, ranging from small bands of a few families to large empires. They lived in several culture areas, which roughly correspond to geographic and biological zones that defined the representative cultures and lifestyles of the indigenous people who lived there, including the bison hunters of the Great Plains and the farmers of Mesoamerica. Native groups also are classified by their language families, which included Athapascan and Uto-Aztecan languages. Indigenous peoples with similar languages did not always share the same material culture, however, and were not necessarily always allies. Anthropologists speculate that the Inuit of the high Arctic arrived in North America much later than other native groups, evidenced by the disappearance of Dorset culture artifacts from the archaeological record and their replacement by the Thule people.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA shared telephone system known as the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) is an integrated telephone numbering plan of 24 countries and territories: the U.S. and its territories, Canada, Bermuda, and 17 Caribbean nations.\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nYet as cities grow in these warmer regions of North America, they are increasingly forced to deal with the major issue of water shortages.[126]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Its population as of 2021[update] has been estimated at more than 434 million.[1][2] South America ranks fourth in area (after Asia, Africa, and North America) and fifth in population (after Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America). Brazil is by far the most populous South American country, with almost half of the continent's population, followed by Colombia, Argentina, Venezuela and Peru.

They are distributed as to form a \"hollow continent\" with most of the population concentrated around the margins of the continent.[70] On one hand, there are several sparsely populated areas such as tropical forests, the Atacama Desert and the icy portions of Patagonia. On the other hand, the continent presents regions of high population density, such as the great urban centers. The population is formed by descendants of Europeans (mainly Spaniards, Portuguese and Italians), Africans and Amerindians. There is a high percentage of Mestizos that vary greatly in composition by place. There is also a minor population of Asians,[*further explanation needed*] especially in Brazil, Peru, and Argentina. The two main languages are by far Spanish and Portuguese, followed by English, French and Dutch in smaller numbers.\n\n\n\n### Language[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of South America\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | * **Submerged continent/lands and microcontinents**Beringia\n* Cathaysia\n* Doggerland\n* Great Australian Bight\n* Jan Mayen\n* Kerguelen Plateau\n* Madagascar\n* Mauritia\n* Sahul\n* Seychelles\n* Sunda\n* Zealandia\n | * **Possible future supercontinents**Amasia\n* Aurica\n* Novopangaea\n* Pangaea Proxima\n | * **Mythical, lost, and hypothesised continents**Atlantis\n* Hyperborea\n* Kumari Kandam\n* Lemuria\n* Meropis\n* Mu\n* *Terra Australis*\n | * **Subcontinents**Alaska\n* Arabia\n* Central America\n* Eastern Africa\n* Eastern Siberia\n* Greenland\n* Indian Subcontinent\n |\n |\n\n |\n| * See also: **![](image) World portal**\n* Regions of the world\n* Continental fragment\n* ![](image) Category\n* Chronology of continents\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nCountries and dependencies of South America\n |\n| --- |\n| Sovereignstates | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFive of the top ten metropolitan areas are in Brazil. These metropolitan areas all have a population of above 4 million and include the S\u00e3o Paulo metropolitan area, Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area, and Belo Horizonte metropolitan area. Whilst the majority of the largest metropolitan areas are within Brazil, Argentina is host to the second largest metropolitan area by population in South America: the Buenos Aires metropolitan region is above 13 million inhabitants.\n\n\nSouth America has also been witness to the growth of megapolitan areas. In Brazil four megaregions exist including the Expanded Metropolitan Complex of S\u00e3o Paulo with more than 32 million inhabitants. The others are the Greater Rio, Greater Belo Horizonte and Greater Porto Alegre. Colombia also has four megaregions which comprise 72% of its population, followed by Venezuela, Argentina and Peru which are also homes of megaregions.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"World Population Prospects 2022\".

Most of the continent lies in the tropics, except for a large part of the Southern Cone located in the middle latitudes.\n\n\nThe continent's cultural and ethnic outlook has its origin with the interaction of indigenous peoples with European conquerors and immigrants and, more locally, with African slaves. Given a long history of colonialism, the overwhelming majority of South Americans speak Spanish or Portuguese, and societies and states are rich in Western traditions. Relative to Europe, Asia and Africa, post-1900 South America has been a peaceful continent with few wars.[10][11][k]\n\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of South America\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn chicken meat production, Argentina ranks among the 15 largest producers in the world, and Peru and Colombia among the 20 biggest producers.

These countries alone account for more than 75 percent of the region's economy and add up to a GDP of more than US$3.0 trillion. Industries in South America began to take on the economies of the region from the 1930s when the Great Depression in the United States and other countries of the world boosted industrial production in the continent. From that period the region left the agricultural side behind and began to achieve high rates of economic growth that remained until the early 1990s when they slowed due to political instabilities, economic crises and neoliberal policies.[101]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"The Global Religious Landscape\" (PDF).

Argentina has ports such as Port of Buenos Aires and Port of Rosario. Chile has important ports in Valpara\u00edso, Caldera, Mejillones, Antofagasta, Iquique, Arica and Puerto Montt. Colombia has important ports such as Buenaventura, Cartagena Container Terminal and Puerto Bolivar. Peru has important ports in Callao, Ilo and Matarani. The 15 busiest ports in South America are: Port of Santos (Brazil), Port of Bahia de Cartagena (Colombia), Callao (Peru), Guayaquil (Ecuador), Buenos Aires (Argentina), San Antonio (Chile), Buenaventura (Colombia), Itaja\u00ed (Brazil), Valpara\u00edso (Chile), Montevideo (Uruguay), Paranagu\u00e1 (Brazil), Rio Grande (Brazil), S\u00e3o Francisco do Sul (Brazil), Manaus (Brazil) and Coronel (Chile).[235]\n\n\n\n#### Rail[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe main public transport in major cities is the bus. Many cities also have a diverse system of metro and subway trains, the first of which was the Buenos Aires subte, opened 1913.[238] The Santiago subway[239] is the largest network in South America, with 103\u00a0km, while the S\u00e3o Paulo subway is the most heavily used, with more than 4.6 million passengers per day[240] and was voted the best in the Americas. Rio de Janeiro installed the first railroad of the continent in 1854. Today the city has a vast and diversified system of metropolitan trains, integrated with buses and subway. Recently it was also inaugurated in the city a Light Rail System called VLT, a small electrical trams at low speed, while S\u00e3o Paulo inaugurated its monorail, the first of South America.[*citation needed*] In Brazil, an express bus system called Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), which operates in several cities, has also been developed. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the production of oil, Brazil was the 10th largest oil producer in the world in 2019, with 2.8 million barrels / day. Venezuela was the 21st largest, with 877 thousand barrels / day, Colombia in 22nd with 886 thousand barrels / day, Ecuador in 28th with 531 thousand barrels / day and Argentina 29th with 507 thousand barrels / day. As Venezuela and Ecuador consume little oil and export most of their production, they are part of OPEC. Venezuela had a big drop in production after 2015 (where it produced 2.5 million barrels / day), falling in 2016 to 2.2 million, in 2017 to 2 million, in 2018 to 1.4 million and in 2019 to 877 thousand, due to lack of investments.[181]\n\n\nIn the production of natural gas, in 2018, Argentina produced 1524 bcf (billion cubic feet), Venezuela 946, Brazil 877, Bolivia 617, Peru 451, Colombia 379.[182]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSouth America shares with Europe supremacy over the sport of football as all winners in FIFA World Cup history and all winning teams in the FIFA Club World Cup have come from these two continents. Brazil holds the record for most times winning the FIFA World Cup with five titles.[201] Argentina has three titles and Uruguay two. So far five South American nations have hosted the tournament including the first edition in Uruguay (1930). Two were from Brazil (1950, 2014), Chile (1962), and Argentina (1978).\n\n\nSouth America is home to the longest-running international football tournament, the Copa Am\u00e9rica, which has been contested since 1916. Argentina and Uruguay have won the Copa Am\u00e9rica 15 times each, the most among all countries.\n\n\nAlso, in South America, a multi-sport event, the South American Games, are held every four years. The first edition was held in La Paz in 1978 and the most recent took place in Santiago in 2014.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince the end of the economic crisis in Brazil and Argentina that occurred in the period from 1998 to 2002, which has led to economic recession, rising unemployment and falling population income, the industrial and service sectors have been recovering rapidly. Chile, Argentina and Brazil have recovered fastest, growing at an average of 5% per year. All of South America after this period has been recovering and showing good signs of economic stability, with controlled inflation and exchange rates, continuous growth, a decrease in social inequality and unemployment\u00a0\u2013 factors that favor industry.[101]\n\n\nThe main industries are: electronics, textiles, food, automotive, metallurgy, aviation, naval, clothing, beverage, steel, tobacco, timber, chemical, among others. Exports reach almost US$400 billion annually, with Brazil accounting for half of this.[101]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Rafael Correa, Evo Morales, N\u00e9stor Kirchner, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Nicanor Duarte, and Hugo Ch\u00e1vez signed the founding charter of the Bank of the South.\n![](image)Trading panel of the S\u00e3o Paulo Stock Exchange is the second biggest in the Americas and 13th in the world.\n![](image)Financial center of Santiago, Chile\n![](image)Launch at the Kourou Space Centre in French Guiana\n![](image)Refinery of Brazilian state-owned Petrobras in Cochabamba, Bolivia\n![](image)Chuquicamata is the largest open pit mine in the world, near the city of Calama in Chile.\n![](image)KC-390 is the largest military transport aircraft produced in South America by the Brazilian company Embraer.\n![](image)Vineyard in Luj\u00e1n de Cuyo, province of Mendoza, Argentina\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n113. **^** Formigoni, Ivan (30 May 2019). \"Maiores exportadores de carne de frango entre 2015 e 2019\".

It came to have about 100,000\u00a0km of rails, but the lifting of tracks and the emphasis placed on motor transport gradually reduced it. It has four different trails and international connections with Paraguay, Bolivia, Chile, Brazil and Uruguay. The Brazilian railway network has an extension of about 30,000 kilometers. It's basically used for transporting ores.[236] Chile has almost 7,000\u00a0km of railways, with connections to Argentina, Bolivia and Peru. Colombia has about 3,500\u00a0km of railways.[237]\n\n\n\n#### Waterways[edit]\n\n\nSouth America has one of the largest bays of navigable inland waterways in the world, represented mainly by the Amazon basin, the Platine basin, the S\u00e3o Francisco and the Orinoco basins, Brazil having about 54,000\u00a0km navigable, while Argentina has 6,500\u00a0km and Venezuela, 1,200\u00a0km.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
