Becoming Me traces Obama's early life growing up on the South Side of Chicago with her parents - Fraser and Marian Robinson - in an upstairs apartment where she got her first piano lessons and learnt to be an independent girl under the nurturing care of her parents. There, Obama shared a bedroom with her brother Craig.[10] The book continues through her education at Princeton University and Harvard Law School, to her early career as a lawyer at the law firm Sidley Austin, where she met Barack Obama. While this section talks considerably at length about Obama's Princeton experience and Sidley Austin, Harvard Law school's experiences are mentioned marginally by comparison.[11]\n\n\nBecoming Us departs from the beginning of the Obamas' romantic relationship and follows their marriage, and the beginning of his political career in the Illinois State Senate. This section also notes Obama's career \"swerve\" from corporate law to the non-profit realm as she continued to work while raising her daughters and speaking at political events, becoming gradually more involved in her husband's campaign. The book shares Obama's balance between her position as the first African American First Lady of the United States of America, her motherly duties, and marital commitments.[10] The section ends with election night in 2008 when Barack Obama was elected President of the United States.\n\n\nBecoming More takes the readers through Barack Obama's presidency, Michelle Obama's focus on her Let's Move campaign, and her role of \"head mom in chief\" to her two daughters - Malia and Sasha Obama, along with the other aspects of the Obama's life as first family.[12] The Epilogue talks about the last day of Obamas in the White House which was also Donald Trump's inauguration ceremony and Michelle Obama's reflection on Optimism. She also expresses her lack of desire to ever run for office.[5]\n\n\n\n## Book sales[edit]\n\n\nTotal book sales, including hardcover, audio and e-books editions, sold around 725,000 copies in the United States and Canada during its first day, making it the second best-selling debut for any book in 2018.[13][14] Bob Woodward's *Fear: Trump in the White House* holds the record after selling around 900,000 copies during its first day.[13][14][15] However, Barnes and Noble reported that *Becoming* surpassed *Fear* in first-week sales and had more first-week sales of any adult book since *Go Set a Watchman* in 2015.[16] The book sold 1.4 million copies in its first week.[17] After 15 days, the book became the best-selling book in the US for the year 2018.[5]\n\n\nBy March 26, 2019, *Becoming* had sold 10 million copies.[18] According to *The New York Times*, as of November 2020 the book has \"sold 14 million copies worldwide, including more than 8 million in the U.S. and Canada\".[19]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\nThe review aggregator website Book Marks reported that 18% of critics gave the book a \"rave\" review, while 73% of the critics expressed \"positive\" impressions, based on a sample of 22 reviews.[20] It was an Oprah's Book Club 2.0 selection.[21] The book was given over 42,000 ratings and over 41,000 reviews on Goodreads and received 4.55 out of 5 stars.[22] Hannah Giogris, a writer from *The Atlantic*, used the words \"refreshing\" and \"striking\" to describe the book.[23]\n\n\nIn 2020, the audiobook edition won the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album[24] and was named one of the top ten Amazing Audiobooks for Young Adults by the American Library Association.[25]\n\n\n\n## Soundtrack[edit]\n\n\nAmerican musician Questlove curated a soundtrack for the book, called *The Michelle Obama Musiaqualogy*.[26]\n\n\n\n## Tour[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2018, Michelle Obama went on a national book tour conducted in arenas, often to sold-out crowds starting in Chicago at the United Center.[27] Obama previewed the book and tour on Chicago's Windy City Live daytime television show at her alma mater Whitney M. Young Magnet High School on Chicago's Near West Side.[28]\n\n\nThe initial tour included 12 venues in 10 cities,[29] but expanded with its popularity; as of February 2019, another 21 cities had been added, including six in Europe and four in Canada.[30]\n\n\n\n## Film[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Becoming (2020 documentary film)\n\nIn May 2020, a documentary film based on the book was released on Netflix, following Obama through her book tour.[31] The documentary features footage of Obama's travels behind-the-scenes of the tour and clips of her interviews onstage with moderators including Oprah Winfrey and Stephen Colbert.[32]\n\n\n\n## Translations[edit]\n\n\n* Arabic: ‫وأصبحتُ‬, translated by M.

Published on November 17, 2020, it is the first of a planned two-volume series. Remaining focused on his political career, the presidential memoir documents Obama's life from his early years through to the events surrounding the killing of Osama bin Laden in May 2011. The book is 768 pages long and available in digital, paperback, and hardcover formats and has been translated into two dozen languages. There is also a 29-hour audiobook edition that is read by Obama himself.\n\n\nThe book has received many reviews and was put on end-of-year best-of lists by *The New York Times*, *The Washington Post*, and *The Guardian*. Commercially, it has been extremely successful and, as of the February 7, 2021 issue, the book has been the *New York Times* best-seller in non-fiction for ten consecutive weeks.[1][2][3] The book was highly anticipated and, two months before its release, *The New York Times* remarked that it was \"virtually guaranteed\" to be the year's top seller, despite its mid-November release date.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nBarack Obama had previously published two bestselling books. The memoir *Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance* was published in 1995 by Times Books and the political book *The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream* was published worldwide in 2006 by Crown Publishing Group .[5]\n\n\n*A Promised Land* follows two years behind First Lady Michelle Obama's bestselling memoir *Becoming*, which was also published by Crown and was released on November 13, 2018.[6][7] It is the first of a planned two-volume series.[8] Each President since Harry S. Truman (save John F. Kennedy, due to his untimely death, and George H. W. Bush) has released a full-length memoir; at over 3 years, Obama's took longer to write than any of them.[9] The previous president with the longest time between leaving office and publishing their memoir was Richard Nixon. Obama admitted that he originally intended to \"write a 500-page memoir and be done in a year\" compared to the 700-page memoir after three years that *A Promised Land*[9] became.\n\n\n\n## Content[edit]\n\n\nObama said in a tweet following the announcement of the publication of the book that he aimed to \"provide an honest accounting of my presidency, the forces we grapple with as a nation, and how we can heal our divisions and make democracy work for everybody\".[10][11]\n\n\n\n### Summary[edit]\n\n\nThe memoir, remaining focused on Obama's political life, begins with his early life, details his first campaigns, and stretches through most of his first term as president.[8] The book concludes with the events surrounding the killing of Osama bin Laden in May 2011,[12][13] ending with a meeting between Obama and the Navy SEALs who conducted the raid.[8] While the book remains focused on politics, the first 200 pages of the book, approximately, are devoted to Obama's life and career up through his time in Chicago.[14]\n\n\n\n### Highlights[edit]\n\n\n#### College[edit]\n\n\nObama, when describing his days attending college in the 1980s, admitted that he would read Karl Marx, Michel Foucault, and Herbert Marcuse in order to impress potential love interests. Obama reminisced that \"it's embarrassing to recognize the degree to which my intellectual curiosity those first two years of college paralleled the interests of various women I was attempting to get to know.\"[15] Obama evaluated his college reading as \"a strategy for picking up girls, my pseudo-intellectualism proved mostly worthless.\"[16]\n\n\n\n#### Descriptions of other politicians[edit]\n\n\nObama gives favourable descriptions to many of the staffers and other politicians that he encounters throughout his early life and presidency.[8][17] In her review for the New York Times, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie noted that Obama's \"affection for his first-term inner circle\" was \"moving\" and that in his descriptions of others, he \"makes heroes of people\".[8] The memoir praises Claire McCaskill, who served as a U.S. Senator from Missouri from 2007-2019, for \"voting her conscience\" on The Dream Act, Tim Geithner for his handling of the financial crisis of 2007–2008, and many others.[8]\n\n\nObama is also critical in his description of some other world leaders, such as by writing that Vladimir Putin's \"satirical image of masculine vigor\" has the quality of \"the fastidiousness of a teenager on Instagram.\"[17] Prime Minister of the United Kingdom David Cameron is described by Obama as someone with “the easy confidence of someone who’d never been pressed too hard by life”.[18]\n\n\n\n#### Nobel Prize[edit]\n\n\nSome reviewers commented on Obama's reaction to winning the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize, writing in the book that his simple response was \"for what?\".[8][17] Obama elaborated when arriving in Oslo for the Nobel ceremony: \"The idea that I, or any one person, could bring order to such chaos seemed laughable... On some level, the crowds below were cheering an illusion.\"[17] Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie and Eli Stokols, in their respective reviews, described the reaction as \"incredulous\".[8][17] Obama also recalled telling the First Lady the news after an early morning phone call and receiving the reply \"that's wonderful honey\", before she went back to sleep.[19] In analyzing the response, Adichie noted that Obama \"considers his public image overinflated; he pushes pins into his own hype balloons.\"[8]\n\n\n\n#### United Nations[edit]\n\n\nObama notes in the book, \"In the middle of the Cold War, the chances of reaching any consensus had been slim, which is why the U.N. had stood idle as Soviet tanks rolled into Hungary or U.S. planes dropped napalm on the Vietnamese countryside. Even after the Cold War, divisions within the Security Council continued to hamstring the U.N.'s ability to tackle problems. Its member states lacked either the means or the collective will to reconstruct failing states like Somalia, or prevent ethnic slaughter in places like Sri Lanka.\"[20][21]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\nAccording to book review aggregator website Book Marks, *A Promised Land* received favourable reviews. From the 33 reviews collected, 12 were classified as \"rave\", 16 as \"positive\" and 5 as \"mixed\".[22]\n\n\n\n### Praise[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Nigerian writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie praised Obama's prose and detail in the book for justifying its length.\nIn the opening of one review, published as the front page of *The New York Times Book Review* on November 29, 2020, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie wrote that Obama \"is as fine a writer as they come\" and argued that it is \"not merely that this book avoids being ponderous, as might be expected, even forgiven, of a hefty memoir, but that it is nearly always pleasurable to read, sentence by sentence, the prose gorgeous in places, the detail granular and vivid.\"[8] *Publishers Weekly* posted a review stating that Obama \"delivers a remarkably introspective chronicle of his rise to the White House and his first two-and-a-half years in office\", before closing with: \"This sterling account rises above the crowded field of presidential postmortems.\"[23] The book's entry in *Kirkus Reviews* includes the tag line: \"A top-notch political memoir and serious exercise in practical politics for every reader.\"[24] Walter Clemens wrote a review of the book in the *New York Journal of Books* that opened with \"[e]very sentence in this book deserves to be treasured and relished\" and closed by stating \"anyone who wishes to understand America in the early 21st century should read this book—or listen to it in an audio version narrated by the former president\".[25] The book was also reviewed by Eric Foner in *The Times Literary Supplement*, who wrote that the book is \"elegantly written\" and is \"certainly among the most impressive contributions to this minor genre\", noting: \"A gifted writer, he maintains the reader's interest for over 700 pages\".[26]\n\n\nAmong magazine reviews, Laura Miller, in *Slate Magazine*, wrote that the book \"is a pleasure to read for the intelligence, equanimity, and warmth of its author—from his unfeigned delight in his fabulously wholesome family to his manifest fondness for the people who worked for and with him, especially early on\".[27] *Time* published a review that stated \"Obama knows how to tell a good story\" and that \"[h]is insight into his mindset during his biggest presidential moments is a reminder of his thoughtfulness\".[28] The review continued by stating that \"from cover to cover, A Promised Land is a reminder of the narrative that Obama has spent his career enunciating\".[28] Other reviews were published in *The Wall Street Journal*,[29] *The Financial Times*,[30] *Entertainment Weekly*,[31] *Esquire*,[32] and *Oprah Magazine*.[33]\n\n\nAmong newspaper reviews, Eli Stokols wrote a review of the book that was published in both the *Los Angeles Times*,[17] and *The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette*.[34] Stokols wrote that the book is \"deeply introspective and at times elegiac\" and has \"elegant prose\".[17][34] Stokols went on to write that the book \"often reads like a conversation Obama is having with himself\", as he would express self-doubt over his various actions and inactions while in office.[17][34] Jeffrey Goldberg wrote in *The Atlantic* that the book is \"an unusual presidential memoir in many ways: unusually interior, unusually self-critical, unusually modern..., and unusually well written.\"[35] Peter Bergen wrote a review for CNN stating that the book is \"moving\" and \"beautifully written\" and finishes the review by stating the second volume \"will surely be another very compelling book\".[36]\n\n\nIn a review in *The Guardian*, Gary Younge wrote: \"As a work of political literature A Promised Land is impressive\" and that \"Obama is a gifted writer\".[19] In a second review published by *The Guardian*, Julian Borger describes the book as \"701 pages of elegantly written narrative, contemplation and introspection, in which he frequently burrows down into his own motivations\" and that it \"delivers amply on the basic expectations of political autobiographies, providing a granular view from the driving seat of power.\"[18] In a third review in *The Guardian*, Peter Conrad wrote: \"Like the best autobiographers, Barack Obama writes about himself in the hope of discovering who or even what he is.\"[37]\n\n\nThe book was also reviewed by Carlos Lozada in *The Washington Post*,[38] and Nate Marshall in the *Chicago Tribune*.[39] The book also received a second review in *The New York Times* that described it as \"700 pages that are as deliberative, measured and methodical as the author himself\". The review states that, while the book comes during \"a time of grandiose mythologizing\", Obama \"marshals his considerable storytelling skills to demythologize himself\".[14] The review then argues that, while it is addressed to \"young people who seek to 'remake the world'\", the book \"is less about unbridled possibility and more about the forces that inhibit it\".[14] Several British newspapers, including *The Times*,[40] *The Observer*,[41] and *The Independent*,[42] have published reviews of the book as well. Among other news agencies, it was also reviewed by *The Boston Globe*[43] and NPR.[44]\n\n\n\n### Critique[edit]\n\n\nIn her review, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie criticized Obama for his incessant \"reluctance to glory\", writing: \"It brings an urge to say, in response, 'Look, take some credit already!'\".[8] Adichie also noted that Obama had a tendency to be overly self-critical, in a manner she described as \"darker than self-awareness but not as dark as self-loathing\".[8] She also notes that the extreme self-awareness may have contributed to his \"wholesome humanity\" and \"deep generosity\", including his praises of those around him.[8] Adichie continued by writing: \"And yet for all his ruthless self-assessment, there is very little of what the best memoirs bring: true self-revelation.\"[8] Adichie blamed this on Obama's detached style, saying that \"[i]t is as if, because he is leery of exaggerated emotion, emotion itself is tamped down.\"[8] She later stated that the best parts of the memoir are the surprising \"gossipy\" bits.[8]\n\n\nIn her *Slate Magazine* article on November 20, 2020, Laura Miller summarized the book's initial reviews by stating it is \"admirable but, depending on their viewpoints, insufficiently intimate, lacking racial indignation, or just a bit glum.\"[27] Miller also noted that many of the book's critics complained about the book's length, and that despite its length, it is the first of multiple volumes.[27] Miller notes that the book has a tendency to provide \"what some consider an excess of background information\" when describing situations and protocols.[27] The review goes on to note that many of the explanations can seem \"remedial\" for \"a practiced observer of the executive branch\", that Miller acknowledges is \"often the sort of person who gets asked to weigh in on such a book\".[27]\n\n\nPhilip Terzian wrote in *The Wall Street Journal* that \"[a]s a matter of substance\", the book \"tells us little that a newspaper reader wouldn't already know\" and that it \"can get monotonous at times\", going on to write that the \"chapters unfold in a formulaic, curiously uniform, fashion\".[29] In another review, Edward Luce wrote in *The Financial Times* that the book's main \"deficiency\" is that Obama \"is too reasonable, almost to the point of detachment.\"[30]\n\n\nTshilidzi Marwala in *Cape Argus*, *The Star* (South Africa) and voices 360 wrote that Obama like light has a dual nature, one the phenomenon and another the politician. Obama the politician achieved many things under hostile environment while Obama the phenomenon was inspirational and won the Nobel prize for no other reason than the fact that he was a phenomenon. He concluded that Obama the politician triumphed over Obama the phenomenon.[45][46]\n\n\nDinesh D'Souza, an ardent detractor of Obama, tweeted criticism for the repeated usage of the first person pronoun *I* across the memoir's 700+ pages, calling Obama \"the greatest egotist of all time — at least outside of lunatic asylums\". D'Souza himself was lampooned for taking issue with an autobiography being written in the first person.[47][48]\n\n\n\n### Awards[edit]\n\n\nAmong other acclamations, the book won the 2020 Goodreads Choice Awards for Best Memoir and Autobiography.[49] It was named one of \"The 10 Best Books of 2020\" by *The New York Times Book Review*,[50] one of \"50 notable works of nonfiction in 2020\" by *The Washington Post*,[51] one of the \"Best politics books of 2020\" by *The Guardian*,[52] and one of the \"Best Political Books of 2020\" by *Marie Claire*.[53]\n\n\n\n## Publication[edit]\n\n\nThe book was released on November 17, 2020, soon after the national elections, in hardcover, digital and audiobook formats.[5] The bestselling memoir was published by Crown Publishing Group in the United States and Canada while Viking Press served as publisher in other English speaking countries. Penguin, the parent company of both Viking and Crown, has also translated the book into over twenty languages.\n\n\n\n### Sales[edit]\n\n\nThe book was the *New York Times* best-seller for the weeks of December 6, 2020,[3] December 13, 2020,[2] and December 20, 2020,[1] and has been the *Publishers Weekly* Number One Best Seller Overall for three consecutive weeks.[54] The book's first printing was set for a run of 3.4 million copies in the U.S. and Canada.[13] There will be 2.5 million copies printed for international readers.[55] *The New York Times* described the book as being \"virtually guaranteed\" to be the year's top seller.[4] On November 18, Penguin Books reported that the book sold 887,000 copies in the United States and Canada its first day, surpassing the previous record held by his wife Michelle's 2018 book *Becoming*, which sold 725,000 in its first day.[56][57] By November 24, 2020, the book had sold over 1.7 million copies in North America, breaking the record for first week sales of a presidential memoir. The initial 3.4 million copy run was increased to 4.3 million due to high demand.[58] The first 3.3 million units of the book were sold within its first month and ABC News commented that it \"is well on its way to becoming the best-selling presidential memoir in modern times\" on December 16, 2020.[59]\n\n\n\n### Release details (English)[edit]\n\n\nIn English, the book has been released in paperback, hardcover, eBook, and audio versions. The book was published by Crown Publishing Group in the United States and Canada and by Viking Press in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, India, and South Africa.[60] The unabridged audiobook version of the book, which runs for 28 hours and 10 minutes and is read by Obama himself, is also available on Audible.[61] It is the third presidential memoir read by its author, following *White House Diary* by Jimmy Carter and *Decision Points* by George W. Bush.[61]\n\n\n\n* Paperback:\n\t+ Obama, Barack (December 8, 2020). *A Promised Land*. Vol. 1. New York: Crown. ISBN 978-0-525-63376-1.

It also discusses some personal aspects of her life and career, including her feelings towards President Barack Obama following her 2008 presidential campaign loss to him. It is generally supportive of decisions made by the Obama administration.\n\n\nThe book was promoted partly in light of the possibility of a Clinton bid in the 2016 presidential election (in which, two years after the release of the book, she would go on to win the Democratic nomination and then lose to Donald Trump in the general election). Excerpts from the book were released in advance of its publication. Clinton staged an extensive promotional tour for the book, which had the air of a political campaign with groups both for and against her appearing at book-signing events. *Hard Choices* reached #1 on the *New York Times* Best Seller List, but sold considerably less than her 2003 memoir, *Living History*. Interpreting what sales of the book meant for her possible political future became a subject for discussion among interested parties.\n\n\n\n\n## Conception and development[edit]\n\n\nClinton's last day as Secretary of State was February 1, 2013. As she departed from office, she indicated she was unsure of her future plans but that they did include writing another memoir to follow *Living History*.[1]\n\n\nOn April 4, 2013, Simon & Schuster, her previous publisher, announced that Clinton had signed with them for this new work, with a target publication date of June 2014.[2] Lawyer Robert Barnett handled the negotiations from Clinton's side; the financial terms of any advance or royalties were not publicly disclosed.[2] The *New York Post* reported \"industry speculation\" as saying that her advance could be as high as $14 million.[3] Although not confirmed, that figure has been repeated by some other news sources.[4][5] From the beginning, the book was partly seen in the light of a possible Clinton bid for the 2016 presidential election.[2]\n\n\nClinton was assisted in writing the book by three aides credited in the Acknowledgements section as her \"book team\",[6] two former State Department assistants, speechwriter Dan Schwerin and researcher Ethan Gelber, and Ted Widmer, a speechwriter in the Bill Clinton administration.[7] The first draft of the manuscript was three times its final length.[8] Clinton later said that the writing process had been \"terrific\" overall, but that \"some days were off-the-charts wonderful and some days were not-even-on-the-charts terrible.\"[8]\n\n\nDuring April 2014, the official publication date of the book was announced as June 10, 2014,[9] and the title of the book was revealed as *Hard Choices* about a week later.[10]\n\n\n\n## Themes of the book[edit]\n\n\nThe book contained 635 pages of numbered text, accompanied by three sections of plates containing a total of 100 colored photographs.\n\n\nIn the book, Clinton frames the foreign policy situations encountered during her tenure as a series of hard choices, especially those involving the Middle East and the Arab Spring, Afghanistan and Pakistan, and Russia.[11] Special attention is given to the Egyptian Revolution of 2011 and her relations with Egyptian President and longtime personal friend Hosni Mubarak.[12]\n\n\nClinton sometimes delves into disagreements within the Obama administration and where she stood, such as her losing the argument to arm moderate elements of the Syrian opposition.[13][14] In many other cases, however, she does not, saying such discussions \"will remain private to honor the code of confidentiality that should exist between a president and his Secretary of State, especially while he is still in office.\"[11]\n\n\nA chapter of the book dealing with the 2012 Benghazi attack – in which the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, was attacked, resulting in the deaths of the U.S. ambassador to that country, J. Christopher Stevens, and three other Americans – was leaked to *Politico*.[15] It reiterates the explanations for what happened that Clinton and her supporters had previously made.[14]\n\n\nClinton also delves into some personal aspects of her life and career, including getting past any hard feelings towards Obama from her 2008 presidential campaign, events in her family including her daughter Chelsea Clinton's wedding, and glimpses of personal interaction with citizens of other countries during her travels as secretary.[13] The book also addresses the disappointment of her 2008 loss, and for the first time fully recants her 2002 vote on the Iraq War Resolution that cost her in that campaign, writing that \"I thought I had acted in good faith and made the best decision I could with the information I had. And I wasn't alone in getting it wrong. But I still got it wrong. Plain and simple.\"[12][16]\n\n\nThe book concludes with some general thoughts about her visions for America going forward,[12] but it shed no light on whether she would run for president in 2016, saying only, \"[t]he time for another hard choice will come soon.\"[13]\n\n\n\n## Promotional efforts[edit]\n\n\nExcerpts of the books came out early. The first was in early May 2014, when *Vogue* published an excerpt in celebration of Mother's Day that was about and dedicated to Clinton's mother Dorothy Rodham, who had died during Clinton's time as secretary.[15] Simon & Schuster released an Author's Note explaining some of Clinton's perspectives on the book.[15] A video appeared on the book's Facebook page the following day.[17] A cover appearance on *People* magazine was also made to promote the book.[18]\n\n\nLater, the chapter of the book dealing with the Benghazi attack was leaked to *Politico*.[15] Observers suspected this was done to get news about it out of the way early so it would not dominate later coverage of the book as a whole.[15][18] Shortly before the book's publication date, a passage that dealt with the now-repatriated soldier Bowe Bergdahl was made public as well.[15] The promotional book roll-out was staffed by veterans of political campaigns and political communications efforts, rather than the publicists who usually conduct such efforts.[15]\n\n\nThere was competition among top news anchors and interviewers to get the first interviews with Clinton about the book.[19] In the end, Clinton sat down with several of them;[17] the first went to ABC News' Diane Sawyer and aired on June 9.[20] The interviews themselves sometimes made news on topics unrelated to those covered by the book, such as Clinton's description to Sawyer of her and Bill's financial state as they left the White House (\"dead broke\") and an exchange with NPR's Terry Gross on Clinton's evolving views on same-sex marriage.[8][21] A later, unannounced appearance on *The Colbert Report* earned her some positive notices for a comic touch in her mock exchanges with host Stephen Colbert.[22]\n\n\nA promotional book tour in the United States and Canada began on June 10 with a book signing at a Barnes & Noble store in New York that attracted over a thousand people.[23] Other events, sometimes multiple per day,[8] included a public discussion forum in Chicago with Mayor Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton administration aide.[24] When signing books, she just wrote \"Hillary\";[25] no signing of personal items or extra messages were allowed.[26] Clinton's longtime aide Huma Abedin was in charge of managing each event.[21]\n\n\nThe tour events had the air of campaign stops.[8][26][27] Each brought considerable local media attention.[27] The independent SuperPAC known as Ready for Hillary parked a \"Hillary Bus\" nearby and handed out stickers and posters and signed up volunteers.[24][26][28] She herself has never gone on the bus; *The Washington Post* described it as \"a campaign bus before there is even a campaign\".[28]\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Republican National Committee had an intern go around greeting attendees in a large orange squirrel suit.[8] It wore a shirt with the message \"Another Clinton in the White House is Nuts\" and was accompanied by other staffers handing out sheets with anti-Clinton talking points.[27] During one promotional appearance in Washington, D.C., Clinton went up to the orange figure and said, \"Hello, Mr. Squirrel, how are you? I wanted you to get you a copy of my book,\" adding, \"you bring a smile to a lot of people's faces.\" The copy she gave the squirrel was inscribed, \"Squirrel – Please make a hard choice and read my book! Hillary\".[29]\n\n\nIn early July, Clinton went to Europe to stage promotional appearances for the book, visiting England, Germany, and France.[30] Book signings back in the U.S. continued for the rest of that month.[30] The length of the promotional tour recalled her heavy travel schedule as Secretary of State,[30] and largely put to rest questions about her health that had circulated among some since her concussion and blood clot treatment in late 2012.[31] While the appearances and the news coverage of some of her statements during the tour exposed some of Clinton's strengths and weaknesses as a public figure, they did not change Clinton's poll approval numbers.[31]\n\n\n\n## Critical and commercial reception[edit]\n\n\nInitial reviews for *Hard Choices* were generally mixed to favorable.[8][32][33]\n\n\nWriting for *The New York Times*, longtime book critic Michiko Kakutani said that the volume is better than Clinton's previous memoir and that *Hard Choices* \"turns out to be a subtle, finely calibrated work that provides a portrait of the former secretary of state and former first lady as a heavy-duty policy wonk.\"[18] David Ignatius, writing in *The Washington Post*, said the memoir \"begins and ends in the empty voice of a campaign speech. But in between, it contains a clear and at times riveting account of Hillary Rodham Clinton's four years as secretary of state.\"[34] Robin Abcarian of the *Los Angeles Times* assessed it as \"a richly detailed and compelling chronicle of Clinton's role in the foreign initiatives and crises that defined the first term of the Obama administration ... told from the point of view of a policy wonk.\"[35]\n\n\nJohn Dickerson of *Slate* magazine characterized it as \"a risk-free telling of Clinton's world travels\" and compared it unfavorably to *Duty: Memoirs of a Secretary at War*, the recent account by Robert Gates, Clinton's cabinet colleague as Secretary of Defense.[14] Dickerson added, \"Clinton's account is the low-salt, low-fat, low-calorie offering with vanilla pudding as the dessert. She goes on at great length, but not great depth.\"[14] Michael Scherer of *Time* magazine declared, \"This is a campaign book, written by a candidate (via her speechwriters), processed through a political machine, and delivered to the public with the contradictory goals of depicting the author as a decisive leader and not betraying any evidence of leadership that would turn a voter off.\"[36] Ed Pilkington of *The Guardian* wrote that it was a less overt campaign manifesto than Barack Obama's *The Audacity of Hope* had been in 2006, but \"still manages to adroitly position Clinton for a 2016 presidential bid.\"[12] Peter Baker of the *New York Times Book Review* compared it somewhat unfavorably with former State Secretary Dean Acheson's 1969 memoir, *Present at the Creation: My Years in the State Department*, concluding his review by alluding to Clinton's possible presidential aspirations by saying that \"Acheson won a Pulitzer Prize for his memoir. Clinton seems to have a bigger prize in mind.\"[37]\n\n\nBy the time of the book's publication, it was said to have already received one million pre-orders.[17] In actuality, Simon & Schuster said that it during its first week on sale, it sold over 100,000 copies,[38] a figure supported by extrapolation of the underlying Nielsen BookScan data.[39] It debuted at first on the *New York Times* Best Seller list for hardcover nonfiction.[38] During its second and third weeks of availability, sales of *Hard Choices* declined markedly, but were still enough to keep it atop the *Times* Best Sellers list.[40][41] In the fourth week, sales declined again and the book surrendered the top spot on the *Times* Best Sellers list to Edward Klein's *Blood Feud: The Clintons vs. the Obamas*, a lurid and lightly sourced account of purported rivalries between the two couples and within each marriage.[42] By this point, *Hard Choices* had sold some 177,000 physical copies.[42] By the end of July, the book had sold about 250,000 copies overall, including an estimate for e-book sales.[43] In all, it spent twelve weeks on the *New York Times* Best Seller list, nine of them in the top five.[44]\n\n\nWhether sales for the book were living up to expectations, or indicated a lack of public interest in hearing from Clinton, became an immediate subject for public relations and political spin from interested parties.[4][39][42] Its sales were better than those of memoirs by other former members of the Obama administration, but were considerably less than they had been in the comparable period for Clinton's first memoir *Living History*.[40] The publisher explained this as partly due to the differing contents of the two memoirs and partly due to the declining market for physical, nonfiction books over the decade between the two.[38] In any case, Simon & Schuster was unlikely to make back Clinton's advance or to sell all the copies it had shipped.[42] *Politico* termed the book's sales \"a solid figure in a depleted publishing industry but far from the juggernaut her backers hoped for.\"[43]\n\n\nThe book continued to accumulate sales into the year following its publication. By March 2015, Nielsen BookScan had it selling 264,000 copies,[45] and figure that rose to 280,000 copies by July 2015[46] and 292,200 copies by March 2016.[47] By mid-2015, Clinton had earned more than $5 million in royalties from the book.[48] Compared to recent books published by the many 2016 Republican presidential candidates, her sales were well short of Ben Carson's *One Nation: What We Can All Do To Save America's Future*, but were well ahead of those of any of the others,[45][49] with only the combined sales of a pair of books by Donald Trump coming close.[47] By late November 2015, counting both print and e-books, *Time* magazine said *Hard Choices* had sold a little over 340,000 units.[50]\n\n\n\n## Foreign editions and translations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Italian language edition, *Scelte difficili*, on sale at a bookstore in Florence\nSimon & Schuster viewed international and foreign language sales as key to the book's potential for success.[40] On its initial release date of June 10, it was published in Canada, Great Britain, Australia, India, Germany, the Netherlands, and France.[40] A Spanish language translation, *Decisiones difíciles*, was released on June 24 in the U.S.[51] Altogether, foreign rights to the book were sold in sixteen countries.[52]\n\n\nWhile also available in Hong Kong and Taiwan, *Hard Choices* was effectively banned in mainland China as publishers there declined to purchase either the translation or English-language distribution rights for the book.[52][53][54] Although Chinese publishers did not offer a specific reason for declining to buy the book, Simon & Schuster asserted that the ban was politically motivated as import agencies and publishers were fearful of retaliation by the Chinese government for printing material that was too politically sensitive, such as the chapter-length coverage of Chinese dissident Chen Guangcheng and Clinton's generally critical comments about the Chinese government.[52][53][55]\n\n\n\n## Paperback version[edit]\n\n\nThe paperback version of *Hard Choices* followed the hardcover and was released on April 28, 2015, two weeks after the announcement of her 2016 presidential campaign. The new epilogue from the paperback edition, titled \"A New Chapter\", was initially published by *The Huffington Post* by Clinton on April 10.[56] The paperback version also has a new cover, in color, in which Clinton is angled away from the camera, turning her head and smiling slightly, while dressed in a blue, collared shirt and wearing bold silver earrings.[57]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Kim, Eun Kyung (January 29, 2013). \"Hillary Clinton to write second memoir\". *Today*.

K. Rowling. The book was published worldwide by the Little, Brown Book Group on 27 September 2012. A paperback edition was released on 23 July 2013. It was Rowling's first publication since the *Harry Potter* series, her first apart from that series, and her first novel for adult readership.[1]\n\n\nThe novel is set in a suburban West Country town called Pagford and begins with the death of beloved parish councillor Barry Fairbrother. Consequently, a seat on the council is vacant and a conflict ensues before the election for his successor takes place. Factions develop, particularly concerning whether to dissociate with a local council estate, 'the Fields', with which Barry supported an alliance. However, those running for a place soon find their darkest secrets revealed on the Parish Council online forum, ruining their campaign and leaving the election in turmoil.\n\n\nMajor themes in the novel are class, politics, and social issues such as drugs, prostitution and rape. The novel was the fastest-selling in the United Kingdom in three years,[2] and had the second best-selling opening week for an adult novel there since Dan Brown's *The Lost Symbol*. It became the 15th best-selling book of 2012 during its first week of release. Within the first three weeks the book's total sales topped one million copies in English in all formats across all territories, including the US and the UK.[3] The book also set a Goodreads record for the all-time biggest 'started reading' day,[4] later winning the Best Fiction category in the Goodreads Choice Awards 2012.\n\n\nThe book was adapted into a television drama broadcast in 2015.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Contents[edit]\n\n\nThe book is dedicated to Rowling's husband, Neil Murray.[6] This was the third time Murray has received a dedication from his wife, after she shared a dedication in the fifth *Harry Potter* book, *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix* and the seventh *Harry Potter* book, *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*.\n\n\nThe book is split into seven parts, and features varying narratives. Each section is headed by a definition from Charles Arnold-Baker's book *Local Council Administration*.\n\n\n\n### Plot summary[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fictional town Pagford is located in the West Country, much like Rowling's birthplace Yate, Gloucestershire\nThe novel is split into seven parts, the first depicting the death of local Pagford Parish Councillor, Barry Fairbrother, who suffers a burst aneurysm in the car park of a local golf course. The inhabitants of the town share the news with their friends and relatives and chaos ensues. The problem arises in deciding whether local council estate 'The Fields' should join the local city of Yarvil, or remain as part of Pagford as Fairbrother favoured; his death is seen by many as an opportunity to end the debate once and for all. The fate of the methadone rehabilitation clinic, Bellchapel, is also a key controversy in the parish.\n\n\nAfter the date for the election of Fairbrother's replacement is announced, the children of some of the councillors and candidates decide to make damaging, yet often accurate, posts on the Parish Council online forum. Andrew Price is the first to do so, by means of an SQL injection which he learned how to perform in school, operating under the name 'The\\_Ghost\\_Of\\_Barry\\_Fairbrother' and informing everyone that his father, Simon, had obtained a stolen computer. Sukhvinder follows, posting that her mother, Dr. Parminder Jawanda, was in love with Barry. Thirdly, Fats Wall posts, claiming his adoptive father Cubby (a Deputy Headteacher) suffers from obsessive fear of having molested a child without any memory of the fact. Finally, in a desperate attempt to relieve the guilt weighing on him for costing his father his job, Andrew confides in Simon and posts that Council leader Howard Mollison is having an affair with his business partner Maureen. Howard's son, Miles Mollison, is the winning candidate, much to the displeasure of his wife, Samantha, who confesses she did not know if she still loves him, only to eventually reconcile.\n\n\nAnother focus of the novel is the traumatic life of Krystal Weedon. Sixteen-year-old Krystal lives in The Fields with her four-year-old brother Robbie and their heroin-addicted prostitute mother Terri. Social worker Kay is determined for Terri to stop her drug use and take responsibility for the care of Robbie; however, Terri relapses and her drug dealer Obbo rapes Krystal. Spurred on to start a family elsewhere, Krystal has unprotected sex with Fats in an attempt to become pregnant. It is during one of these instances that Robbie runs away from the pair in a park, eventually falling and drowning in a river, despite Sukhvinder's attempts to save him. Krystal is so distraught she commits suicide by taking a heroin overdose, the novel culminating with the siblings' funeral.\n\n\n\n### Characters[edit]\n\n\n(*The Telegraph* published a guide to all 34 characters.[7])\n\n\n\n* Barry Fairbrother, a member of the Parish Council who was born and raised in The Fields. Eloquent and fairminded, he is the leader of the faction of the Parish council wishing to keep The Fields in Pagford, in the hope the people can improve themselves as he did. He coached the girls' rowing team and was particularly fond of Krystal Weedon. It is his death that rocks the community.\n* Mary Fairbrother, widow of Barry Fairbrother. Due to the fact that Barry was about to publish an article about The Fields prior to his demise, she blames The Fields for occupying his mind, and therefore causing his death.\n* Howard Mollison, leader of the Parish Council and of those who seek to put the Fields under Yarvil control to safeguard the community. He is the owner of a delicatessen and married to Shirley. He is morbidly obese and suffers a heart attack after Andrew's anonymous accusations that he has had an affair with business partner Maureen.\n* Shirley Mollison, wife of Howard Mollison and mother of Miles. She is devoted to Howard and all of his endeavours, until she learns of his affair with his business partner Maureen.\n* Patricia 'Pat' Mollison, daughter of Howard and Shirley and sister to Miles, who lives in London and only comes to Pagford for her father's birthday party. Her relationship with her mother is strained due to her being gay. When she comes to Howard's birthday party, she drunkenly tells Fats and Andrew of the love affair between her father and Maureen.\n* Miles Mollison, a lawyer who works with Gavin; he is the son of Howard and Shirley, brother of Pat and husband of Samantha. Miles runs for and eventually wins the council election.\n* Samantha Mollison, wife of Miles and manager of a failing bra shop. Samantha hates her life in Pagford, and has lost interest in Miles. She fancies Vikram Jawanda, and 'Jake', a member of her daughter's favourite boyband, and ends up kissing sixteen-year-old Andrew Price. She despises her mother-in-law Shirley, and appears to have an alcohol problem.\n* Krystal Weedon, a resident of 'The Fields' who dates Fats Wall. She suffers a traumatic childhood, raised by her heroin-addicted mother, frequently acting as sole caregiver to younger brother Robbie, and suffering rape at the hands of her mother's drug dealer. She commits suicide following Robbie's death.\n* Terri Weedon, a heroin addict and prostitute, mother of Krystal and Robbie and resident of 'The Fields'. She has been ostracised by her family for her addiction. She attempts to rehabilitate through the Bellchapel clinic, but fails and ultimately relapses.\n* Colin 'Cubby' Wall, Deputy Headteacher of the local comprehensive. He considers himself to be a close friend of Barry's and stands for election. This is later marred by anonymous accusations made by his adoptive son, 'Fats', that he is afraid of being accused of molesting a child. This considerably worsens his obsessive compulsive disorder; he often has nightmares about such acts.\n* Tessa Wall, wife of Cubby and adoptive mother of Fats. She is the school's guidance counsellor and has regular meetings with Krystal Weedon, although she later disapproves of her relationship with her son. Also a diabetic.\n* Stuart 'Fats' Wall, adopted son of Colin and Tessa, Andrew's best friend and popular at school due to his witty humour. He bullies Sukhvinder and begins a sexual relationship with Krystal Weedon. His strained relationship with his adoptive parents leaves him debating his morality and what his real parents are like. His only post as 'The\\_Ghost\\_of\\_Barry\\_Fairbrother' reveals his father's fears. When he partially causes Robbie Weedon's death, Tessa explains his birth mother had him when she was fourteen, possibly being the product of incest, and he was taken in despite Colin's poor health. He shoulders the blame for all the postings on the council website.\n* Andrew Price, son of Simon and Ruth and Fats' best friend. He develops a romantic interest in Gaia Bawden, securing a weekend job in Howard's delicatessen to be around her. He secretly hates his father Simon for his domineering and abusive behaviour, and resents his mother for putting up with it. He creates the username of 'The\\_Ghost\\_of\\_Barry\\_Fairbrother' to accuse his father of selling stolen goods, to destroy his chances of running for election.\n* Simon Price, husband of Ruth Price and Andrew and Paul's father, who is regularly involved in criminal activity. He physically and verbally abuses his children and wife, and decides to stand for election so he can receive bribes.\n* Kay Bawden, a social worker from London and mother of Gaia. She moves to Pagford to be with her boyfriend Gavin, and becomes Krystal and Terri's social worker temporarily. She has the most success with Terri but is then forced to give up the family's case when her co-worker returns from sick leave. She eventually breaks up with Gavin.\n* Gavin Hughes, a lawyer and Kay's boyfriend, although he is shown to resent her throughout the novel. He claims he was Barry's best friend and eventually confesses his love for Barry's widow, Mary, though she rejects his advances.\n* Gaia Bawden, Kay's attractive daughter, fancied by Andrew. She befriends Sukhvinder and detests Pagford, knowing Gavin is not interested in her mother; she wants to move to Reading to be with her father. She eventually kisses Fats Wall, much to the disappointment of Andrew and Sukhvinder, but later regrets it and reconnects with both friends at Krystal's funeral.\n* Parminder Jawanda, doctor and mother of Sukhvinder, whom she pressures to be upstanding like Parminder's other children. She is a member of the Parish Council and supporter of keeping \"The Fields\", although her motive may be her love of Barry, as posted by Sukhvinder posing as \"The\\_Ghost\\_of\\_Barry\\_Fairbrother\".\n* Sukhvinder Jawanda, daughter of Parminder, is bullied by Fats, pressured by her mother to be great, and self-harms. She was a member of the rowing team alongside Krystal Weedon, but when Krystal's great-grandmother died while under Parminder's care, Krystal threatens to hurt Sukhvinder in revenge. Sukhvinder eventually risks her life in an attempt to save Krystal's brother, Robbie.\n* Vikram Jawanda, handsome husband of Parminder Jawanda and father of Sukhvinder and her siblings. He is the heart surgeon who performed Howard's triple heart bypass.\n* The Ghost of Barry Fairbrother, the secret identity of three Pagford teens who use Barry Fairbrother's old account on the Pagford council's forum to reveal secrets of council members. Andrew Price created the identity to attack his father, Sukhvinder uses it to discredit her mother, and Fats later uses it to smear his adoptive father. Andrew again uses it with his father against Howard Mollison to assuage his guilt. Fats eventually confesses and takes full responsibility following Robbie Weedon's death.\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\n### Conception[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*The Casual Vacancy* is Rowling's first novel after the *Harry Potter* series, the best-selling book series in historyRowling first had the idea on an aeroplane to the United States, whilst on tour for *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*. Referring to the original conception of the *Harry Potter* series on a train from Manchester to London, Rowling said \"Obviously I need to be in some form of vehicle to have a decent idea. This time I was on a plane. And I thought: local election! And I just knew. I had that totally physical response you get to an idea that you know will work. It's a rush of adrenaline, it's chemical. I had it with Harry Potter and I had it with this. So that's how I know.\"[8]\n\n\nRowling's movement from children's literature to adult literature arose from being \"ready to change genre\".[9] Referring to the *Harry Potter* series Rowling commented, \"The thing about fantasy—there are certain things you just don't do in fantasy. You don't have sex near unicorns. It's an ironclad rule. It's tacky.\"[9] Critics questioned whether younger *Harry Potter* fans might be drawn into wanting to read the book, Rowling responded saying, \"There is no part of me that feels that I represented myself as your children's babysitter or their teacher. I was always, I think, completely honest. I'm a writer, and I will write what I want to write.\"[9]\n\n\nRowling rejected Little, Brown's claims that the book was a \"black comedy\", saying in an interview with *The New Yorker*, \"It's been billed, slightly, as a black comedy, but to me it's more of a comic tragedy.\" If the novel had precedents, \"it would be sort of nineteenth-century: the anatomy and the analysis of a very small and closed society.\"[9]\n\n\n\n### Choice of title[edit]\n\n\nFor two years, the working title of the novel was *Responsible*, until Rowling picked up Charles Arnold-Baker's work on local government, *Local Council Administration*,\nwhilst looking something up and came across the term \"casual vacancy.\"[9] *The New Yorker* questioned Rowling's original choice of title, and she remarked \"This is a book about responsibility. In the minor sense—how responsible we are for our own personal happiness, and where we find ourselves in life—but in the macro sense also, of course: how responsible we are for the poor, the disadvantaged, other people’s misery.\"[9]\n\n\n\n## Themes[edit]\n\n\n### Social issues[edit]\n\n\n*The Casual Vacancy* features a range of social issues, including rape, racism, heroin and marijuana use, pornography, domestic abuse, child abuse, self-harm and suicide.[10]\n\n\nSukhvinder Jawanda is often berated by her mother, Parminder, and will resort to self-harm. Andrew Price, along with his brother Paul, suffers child abuse from their father Simon Price throughout the novel. *The New Yorker* questioned Rowling whether this represented her difficult childhood and relationship with her father; Rowling replied, \"Andrew's romantic idea that he'll go and live among the graffiti and broken windows of London—that was me. I thought, I have to get away from this place. So all of my energies went into that\", although she added, \"I did not have an easy relationship with my father, but no one in *The Casual Vacancy* is a portrait of any living person.\"[9]\n\n\n\n### Politics and poverty[edit]\n\n\nOne of the novel's major themes is politics. *The Guardian* referred to *The Casual Vacancy* as a \"parable of national politics\", with Rowling saying, \"I'm interested in that drive, that rush to judgment, that is so prevalent in our society, We all know that pleasurable rush that comes from condemning, and in the short term it's quite a satisfying thing to do, isn't it?\"[8] Rowling was also critical of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat Coalition that had led since the general election in 2010 saying, \"There has been a horribly familiar change of atmosphere [since the 2010 election], it feels to me a lot like it did in the early 90s, where there's been a bit of redistribution of benefits and suddenly lone-parent families are that little bit worse off. But it's not a 'little bit' when you're in that situation. Even a tenner a week can make such a vast, vast difference. So, yeah, it does feel familiar. Though I started writing this five years ago when we didn't have a coalition government, so it's become maybe more relevant as I've written.\"[8] Rowling went on to say that Britain held a \"phenomenally snobby society\", and described the middle class as \"pretentious\" and \"funny\".[8]\n\n\nRowling has commented on her economic situation before the success of *Harry Potter* as being \"poor as it is possible to be in modern Britain, without being homeless\"[9][11] and said that this was why she was drawn to writing about poverty.[12]\n\n\n\n\n> How many of us are able to expand our minds beyond our own personal experience? So many people, certainly people who sit around the cabinet table, say, 'Well, it worked for me' or, 'This is how my father managed it' – these trite catchphrases – and the idea that other people might have had such a different life experience that their choices and beliefs and behaviours would be completely different from your own seems to escape a lot of otherwise intelligent people. The poor are discussed as this homogeneous mash, like porridge. The idea that they might be individuals, and be where they are for very different, diverse reasons, again seems to escape some people.  \n>  – J. K. Rowling, *The Guardian*, \"The worst that can happen is everyone says, That's shockingly bad\", 2012.[11]\n> \n> \n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n*The Casual Vacancy* received mixed reviews. Lev Grossman for *Time* wrote in a positive review, \"It's a big, ambitious, brilliant, profane, funny, deeply upsetting and magnificently eloquent novel of contemporary England, rich with literary intelligence and entirely bereft of bullshit.\"[13] The *Wall Street Journal* wrote \"Once you get your Mileses and Simonses straight and events begin to unfurl, it becomes a positively propulsive read. 'The Casual Vacancy' may not be George Eliot, but it's J.K. Rowling; and that's pretty good.\"[14] *The Guardian* wrote, \"The Casual Vacancy is no masterpiece, but it's not bad at all: intelligent, workmanlike, and often funny.\"[15] *The Economist* opined, \"This is a novel of insight and skill, deftly drawn and, at the end, cleverly pulled together. It plays to her strengths as a storyteller.\"[16] David Robinson of *The Scotsman* praised the novel, saying, \"It is far grittier, bleaker (and, occasionally, funnier) than I had expected, and—the acid test—I suspect it would do well even if its author's name weren't J.K. Rowling.\"[17] *The Telegraph* lauded the novel as well, writing, \"One marvels at the skill with which Rowling weaves such vivid characters in and out of each other's lives, rendering them so complex and viscerally believable that one finds oneself caring for the worst of them.\"[18] Further positive reviews have come from reviewers for the Associated Press, *Express.co.uk*, *The Daily Mirror*, *The Kansas City Star*, *The New Zealand Herald* and the *Daily Beast*, the latter remarked that the book was a \"page turner.\"[19][20][21][22][23][24]\n\n\n*The New York Times'* Michiko Kakutani panned the novel, comparing it unfavourably to Rowling's *Harry Potter* series and saying, \"We do not come away feeling that we know the back stories of the 'Vacancy' characters in intimate detail the way we did with Harry and his friends and enemies, nor do we finish the novel with a visceral knowledge of how their pasts—and their families' pasts—have informed their present lives.\"[25] The *Los Angeles Times* criticised the book, stating that it \"fails to conjure Harry Potter's magic.\"[26] *The Daily Telegraph* maintained the novel was humorous but said \"The novel pretty much explodes towards the end, losing shape in its fury at the dirty, unfair England that we Muggles have made for ourselves. It's like *The Archers* on amyl nitrate.\"[27] *The Times* said \"The difficulty, in this fat novel, is the difference between the reader's level of interest in a wholly invented world, such as Harry Potter's, and the world we're stuck with. Rowling has a sharp eye for vivid details, and there are passages of very good writing in this book... But her fictions have little shadow in them.\"[28]\n\n\n\n### Sales, awards and honours[edit]\n\n\nWithin hours of the book's release, it had reached Number 1 position on the Amazon Book Chart in the United States. It was the second biggest adult opening of all time in the United Kingdom, falling short of Dan Brown's 2009 novel, *The Lost Symbol*, which sold 550,946 copies. It also fell short of Rowling's last release, *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*, that sold 2.6 million copies and became the fastest-selling book in history.[29] It became the 15th best-selling book of 2012 during its first week of release.[2] Little, Brown and Company has announced that within the first three weeks the book's total sales had topped one million copies in English in all formats across all territories, including the US and the UK.[30]\n\n\nThe book won the Best Fiction category in the Goodreads Choice Awards 2012.\n\n\n\n### Portrayal of Sikhism[edit]\n\n\nA Sikh family plays an important part in the novel, and the description of the character Sukhvinder sparked some controversy amongst followers of the Sikh faith. Avtar Singh Makkar, the head of India's Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee, commented that Rowling's book would be examined by the scrutiny board of SGPC for anything objectionable.[31] Rowling stated that she admires the Sikh religion and had done a vast amount of research on Sikhism.[32] Other members of the Sikh community appreciated the fact that Rowling portrayed Sikhs and Sikhism in a favourable light and actually draws attention to discriminations faced by Sikhs.[33]\n\n\n\n## Adaptation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: The Casual Vacancy (miniseries)\n\nOn 3 December 2012, BBC One and BBC Drama commissioned an adaptation of *The Casual Vacancy*. It was a joint production with US channel HBO. Filming began in August 2014.[34] In 2015, the adaptation was broadcast on BBC One, as 3 one-hour segments. Warner Bros. is serving as the worldwide TV distributor of the series, except in the United Kingdom.[35]\n\n\nSome aspects of the story were modified for the TV adaptation. For example, the controversial decision to be made by the parish council was changed from closing a methadone clinic, to closing a country house bequeathed to the village as a public amenity by a rich philanthropist, and replacing it with a spa. Most significantly, Krystal Weedon is portrayed as drowning trying to save her brother Robbie, rather than committing suicide by overdose after failing to save him.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"JK Rowling announces title of first adult novel\".
