It is given in honor of a film director who has exhibited outstanding directing while working in the film industry.\nThe award is traditionally presented by the previous year's Best Director winner.\n\n\nThe 1st Academy Awards ceremony was held in 1929 with the award being split into \"Dramatic\" and \"Comedy\" categories; Frank Borzage and Lewis Milestone won for *7th Heaven* and *Two Arabian Knights*, respectively.[1] However, these categories were merged for all subsequent ceremonies.[2] Nominees are determined by single transferable vote within the directors branch of AMPAS; winners are selected by a plurality vote from the entire eligible voting members of the academy.[3][4][5]\n\n\nFor the first eleven years of the Academy Awards, directors were allowed to be nominated for multiple films in the same year. However, after the nomination of Michael Curtiz for two films, *Angels with Dirty Faces* and *Four Daughters*, at the 11th Academy Awards, the rules were revised so that an individual could only be nominated for one film at each ceremony.[6] That rule has since been amended, although the only director who has received multiple nominations in the same year was Steven Soderbergh for *Erin Brockovich* and *Traffic* in 2000, winning the award for the latter. The Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture have been very closely linked throughout their history. Of the 89 films that won Best Picture and were also nominated for Best Director, 68 won the award.[7][8]\n\n\nSince its inception, the award has been given to 74 directors or directing teams. As of the 2023 ceremony, American filmmaking duo Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert are the most recent winner in this category for their work on *Everything Everywhere All at Once* and the third duo to win after Robert Wise & Jerome Robbins (*West Side Story*) and the Coen brothers (*No Country for Old Men*).\n\n\n\n\n## Winners and nominees[edit]\n\n\nIn the following table, the years are listed as per Academy convention, and generally correspond to the year of film release in Los Angeles County, California; the ceremonies are always held the following year.[9] For the first five ceremonies, the eligibility period spanned twelve months from August 1 to July 31.[10] For the 6th ceremony held in 1934, the eligibility period lasted from August 1, 1932, to December 31, 1933.[10] Since the 7th ceremony held in 1935, the period of eligibility became the full previous calendar year from January 1 to December 31.[10]\n\n\n\n![](image)Frank Borzage won twice: \"Dramatic director\" at the first ceremony, for *7th Heaven* (1927); & later, *Bad Girl* (1931).\n![](image)Lewis Milestone won twice: \"Comedy director\" at the first ceremony, for *Two Arabian Knights* (1927); & later, *All Quiet on the Western Front* (1930).\n![](image)Frank Lloyd won twice, for *The Divine Lady* (1929) & *Cavalcade* (1933).\n![](image)Frank Capra won thrice, for *It Happened One Night* (1934), *Mr. Deeds Goes to Town* (1936), & *You Can't Take It with You* (1938).\n![](image)John Ford won a record four times, for: *The Informer* (1935), *The Grapes of Wrath* (1940), *How Green Was My Valley* (1941), & *The Quiet Man* (1952).\n![](image)Leo McCarey won twice, for *The Awful Truth* (1937) & *Going My Way* (1944).\n![](image)Victor Fleming won for *Gone with the Wind* (1939).\n![](image)William Wyler, with a record twelve nominations, won thrice, for: *Mrs. Miniver* (1942), *The Best Years of Our Lives* (1946), & *Ben-Hur* (1959).\n![](image)Michael Curtiz won for *Casablanca* (1942).\n![](image)Billy Wilder (*right*, with Gloria Swanson) won twice, for *The Lost Weekend* (1945) & *The Apartment* (1960).\n![](image)Elia Kazan won twice, for *Gentleman's Agreement* (1947) & *On the Waterfront* (1954).\n![](image)John Huston won for *The Treasure of the Sierra Madre* (1948).\n![](image)Joseph L.

Subsequent research by AMPAS has resulted in a list of unofficial or *de facto* nominees, based on records of which films were evaluated by the judges.\n3. **^** Michael Curtiz was not on the original ballot of nominees. However, after the year prior with Bette Davis's omission for *Of Human Bondage*, the resulting furor led to a write-in campaign determined to secure her a nomination. Thus, the Academy relaxed their rules and allowed her performance to be amongst the competition. They permitted this once more, prompting further submissions: Curtiz; Paul Muni for *Black Fury*; and several other categories, including Hal Mohr for *A Midsummer Night's Dream*. Ultimately, Mohr became the only person to win an Oscar as a result of this process. The Academy discontinued this option from the next ceremony forward to prevent any recurrence.\n4. **^** The eligibility period for the 93rd ceremony was extended through to February 28, 2021, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* BAFTA Award for Best Direction\n* Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Director\n* Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing – Feature Film\n* Golden Globe Award for Best Director\n* Independent Spirit Award for Best Director\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Dirks, Tim. \"1927–28 Academy Awards Winners\".

The film also stars Stephanie Hsu, Ke Huy Quan, Jamie Lee Curtis, Jenny Slate, Harry Shum Jr., and James Hong in supporting roles.\n\n\nKwan and Scheinert began work on the project in 2010. Production was announced in 2018, and principal photography ran from January to March 2020. The filmmakers initially sought Jackie Chan for the lead role before the script was revised to feature a female protagonist as part of a wife-husband duo.[8] The works of Hong Kong film director Wong Kar-wai, as well as the children's book *Sylvester and the Magic Pebble* and the video game *Everything,* served as inspiration for several scenes. The soundtrack features compositions by Son Lux, including collaborations with Mitski, David Byrne, André 3000, John Hampson, and Randy Newman. The film explores philosophical themes such as existentialism, nihilism, surrealism, and absurdism, as well as themes such as neurodivergence, depression, generational trauma, and Asian American identity.\n\n\n*Everything Everywhere All at Once* premiered at South by Southwest on March 11, 2022, and began a limited theatrical release in the United States on March 25, 2022, before a wide release by A24 on April 8. The film grossed over $141 million worldwide, becoming A24's highest-grossing film. It garnered widespread critical acclaim and was a success at the 95th Academy Awards, winning a leading seven awards out of eleven nominations: Best Picture, Best Actress for Yeoh, Best Supporting Actor for Quan, Best Supporting Actress for Curtis, Best Director and Best Original Screenplay for Kwan and Scheinert, and Best Film Editing.[9][10][11][12] It also won two Golden Globe Awards, five Critics' Choice Awards (including Best Picture), a BAFTA Award, a record four SAG Awards (including Best Ensemble), a record seven Independent Spirit Awards (including Best Feature),[13][14] and swept the four major guild awards (DGA, PGA, SAG, and WGA).[15] With 266 awards out of 405 nominations, *Everything Everywhere All at Once* is currently estimated to be the most awarded film of all time.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nEvelyn Quan Wang is a middle-aged Chinese American immigrant who runs a laundromat with her husband, Waymond; two decades earlier, they eloped to the United States and had a daughter, Joy. In the present day, the laundromat is being audited by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Waymond is trying to serve Evelyn divorce papers in an attempt to get her attention so they can talk about their marriage, Evelyn's stern and demanding father (referred to as *Gong Gong*, Cantonese for \"grandfather\"[16]) is visiting for her Chinese New Year party, and Joy is dealing with depression[17] and has a strained relationship with her mother, which also includes Evelyn's reluctance to accept Joy's lesbian relationship with her non-Chinese girlfriend Becky.\n\n\nAt a tense meeting with IRS inspector Deirdre Beaubeirdre, Waymond's body is taken over by Alpha-Waymond, a version of Waymond from the \"Alphaverse.\" Alpha-Waymond explains to Evelyn that many parallel universes exist because every life choice creates a new alternative universe. In the Alphaverse, the late Alpha-Evelyn developed \"verse-jumping\" technology, which enables people to access the skills, memories, and bodies of their parallel selves by performing bizarre actions that are statistically unlikely. The multiverse is threatened by Jobu Tupaki (Alpha-Joy), whose mind was splintered after Alpha-Evelyn pushed her to verse-jump beyond her endurance; Jobu experiences all universes at once and can verse-jump and manipulate matter at will. She has created a black hole-like \"Everything Bagel\" topped with *everything*,[18] which appears as a toroid singularity[19] that could destroy the multiverse.\n\n\nEvelyn is given verse-jumping technology to fight Jobu's minions, who converge on the IRS building. She discovers other universes in which she made different choices and flourished, such as becoming a kung fu master and film star; she also learns of Waymond's plans with the divorce papers. Alpha-Waymond believes that Evelyn, as the greatest \"failure\" of all Evelyns in the multiverse, has the untapped potential to defeat Jobu. Gong Gong is taken over by Alpha-Gong Gong, who instructs Evelyn to kill Joy to stop Jobu from using her to enter Evelyn's universe. Evelyn refuses and decides to face Jobu by gaining powers through repeated verse-jumping. Alpha-Gong Gong, convinced that Evelyn's mind has been compromised like Jobu's, sends soldiers after Evelyn. While they fight, Jobu locates and kills Alpha-Waymond in the Alphaverse. As Jobu confronts Evelyn in her universe, Evelyn's mind splinters, and she collapses.\n\n\nEvelyn uncontrollably verse-jumps alongside Jobu across bizarre and diverse universes. Jobu reveals she does not want to fight at all, but that instead, she has been searching for an Evelyn who can see, as she does, that nothing matters, while killing the Evelyns that do not agree with her. She brings Evelyn to the Everything Bagel, explaining that she wants to use it to allow herself and Evelyn to truly die. Upon looking into the Bagel, Evelyn is initially persuaded, and behaves cruelly and nihilistically in her other universes, hurting those around her.\n\n\nAs Evelyn is about to enter the Bagel with Jobu, she pauses to listen to Waymond's pleas in her universe for everybody to stop fighting and to instead be kind, even when life does not make sense. Evelyn has an existentialist epiphany and decides to follow Waymond's absurdist[20] and humanist[21] advice, using her multiverse powers to fight with empathy[22] and bring happiness to those around her; in doing so, she repairs her damage in the other universes and neutralizes Alpha-Gong Gong and Jobu's fighters. In her home universe, Evelyn reconciles with Waymond, accepts Joy and Becky's relationship and tells Gong Gong of it, and talks with Deirdre after Waymond convinces Deirdre to let them redo their taxes. Jobu decides to enter the Bagel alone while, simultaneously in Evelyn's universe, Joy begs Evelyn to let her go. Evelyn tells Joy that even when nothing makes sense and even though she could be anywhere else in the multiverse, she would always want to be with Joy. Evelyn and the others save Jobu from the Bagel, and Evelyn and Joy embrace.\n\n\nSome time later, with the family's relationships improved, they return to the IRS building to refile their taxes. As Deirdre talks, Evelyn's attention is momentarily drawn to her alternative selves, before she grounds herself back in her home universe.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n(Clockwise) *Everything Everywhere All at Once* stars Michelle Yeoh, Ke Huy Quan, Stephanie Hsu, Jamie Lee Curtis, and James Hong\n\n* Michelle Yeoh as Evelyn Quan Wang, a dissatisfied and overwhelmed laundromat owner; and as several other versions of Evelyn in alternate universes.\n* Stephanie Hsu as Joy Wang, Evelyn's daughter; and Jobu Tupaki, Alpha-Evelyn's omnicidal daughter whose growing nihilism is a threat to the entire multiverse.\n* Ke Huy Quan as Waymond Wang, Evelyn's meek and goofy husband whose humanist existentialism is the antidote to Jobu's nihilism; and as Alpha-Waymond, from the Alphaverse; and other versions of Waymond in alternate universes.\n* Jenny Slate as Debbie the Dog Mom, a laundromat customer. Her original name of Big Nose was changed for the film's digital release because of its association with Jewish stereotypes.[23]\n* James Hong as Gong Gong (Cantonese for \"grandfather\"[16]), Evelyn's demanding father; and Alpha-Gong Gong, Alpha-Evelyn's father in the Alphaverse who wants Evelyn to sacrifice Joy to impede Jobu.\n* Jamie Lee Curtis as Deirdre Beaubeirdre, an IRS inspector; and as other versions of Deirdre in alternate universes.\n\n\nTallie Medel appears as Becky Sregor, Joy's girlfriend; Biff Wiff appears as Rick, a laundromat customer; Sunita Mani and Aaron Lazar appear as actors in a musical film Evelyn watches; Audrey Wasilewski and Peter Banifaz appear as Alpha RV Officers; Andy Le and Brian Le appear as Alpha Trophy Jumpers; Li Jing appears as Evelyn's kung-fu teacher,[24] and Michiko Nishiwaki appears as Evelyn's kung-fu opponent and co-star. Harry Shum Jr. plays Chad, a *teppanyaki* chef working alongside an alternative Evelyn in another universe.\n\n\nRandy Newman, who has scored nine Disney–Pixar films, appears as the voice of Raccacoonie, a reference to the Pixar-animated film *Ratatouille* (2007); he is credited as a featured artist on the soundtrack \"Now We're Cookin'\".[25] Cameos include Scheinert as District Manager, and Kwan uncredited as a man sucked into the bagel and as a mugger.[26]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Writer-directors Daniel Scheinert and Daniel Kwan\nCo-directors Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, known as the Daniels, began researching the concept of the multiverse as early as 2010, after being exposed to the concept of modal realism in the Ross McElwee documentary *Sherman's March* (1986).[19] Kwan described the release of the animated film *Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse* (2018), which also deals with a multiversal concept, as \"a little upsetting because we were like, 'Oh shit, everyone's going to beat us to this thing we've been working on.'\"[19] He also stated \"Watching the second season of *Rick and Morty* (2013-present) was really painful. I was like, 'They've already done all the ideas we thought were original!' It was a really frustrating experience. So I stopped watching *Rick and Morty* while we were writing this project\".[19]\n\n\nIn early drafts of the screenplay, the directors planned for the main character to be a professor and have undiagnosed attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); through his research for the project, Kwan learned that he had undiagnosed ADHD.[27]\n\n\nScenes in which Evelyn trains in martial arts and becomes an action film star were visually and contextually inspired by the films of Wong Kar-wai. Chris Lee of *Vulture* writes that they \"conjur[e] a mood of exquisite romantic yearning that will be instantly recognizable ... as touchstones\" of Wong's works. The universe in which Evelyn and Joy are rocks was influenced by the children's book *Sylvester and the Magic Pebble* (1969) and the video game *Everything* (2017).[19]\n\n\nKwan has said the idea of the everything bagel \"started as just a throwaway joke\", a play on a type of American bagel called an \"everything bagel\", which is baked with a large variety of toppings. Scheinert said they spent time attempting to develop the religion of bagel followers, but encountered complications: \"Jobu Tupaki's a nihilist; should there be dogma? Should there be a book? What should their practices be as a religion? The bagel stuck because it became such a useful, simple symbol that we could point to as filmmakers. And you don't have to explain it much beyond the joke.\"[19][18]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ke Huy Quan, pictured in 2018, retired from acting in 2002 and returned shortly before being cast in this film.\nThe script was written for Jackie Chan until Kwan and Scheinert reconceived the protagonist as a woman, feeling it would make the husband–wife dynamic in the story more relatable.[28]\n\n\nThe new script's lead character was initially named Michelle Wang, after the film's lead actress Michelle Yeoh, who said, \"If you ask the Daniels, when they started on this draft, they focused on, 'Well, we are doing this for Michelle Yeoh.'\"[29] The character's name was eventually changed to Evelyn. With her resemblance to the version of Evelyn as a martial artist and film star,[30] Yeoh opposed naming the character Michelle. \"Evelyn deserves her own story to be told. This is a very ordinary mother [and] housewife who is trying her best to be a good mother to her daughter, a good daughter to her father, a wife that's trying to keep the family together [...] I don't like to integrate me, Michelle Yeoh, into the characters that I play, because they all deserve their own journey and their stories to be told\".[30]\n\n\nIt was announced in August 2018 that Yeoh and Awkwafina had been cast to star in what was described as an \"interdimensional action film\" from Kwan and Scheinert, with Anthony and Joe Russo attached to produce.[31] Awkwafina left the project in January 2020 due to scheduling conflicts, and was replaced with Stephanie Hsu. James Hong, Ke Huy Quan, and Jamie Lee Curtis joined the cast. It marked Quan's return to film acting, from which he had retired after *Second Time Around* (2002) due to a lack of casting opportunities.[32][33] Kwan and Scheinert were inspired to cast Quan after seeing a meme of former New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang being shown as a grown-up version of Short Round, Quan's character from *Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom* (1984). They were curious to learn what Quan had been doing, and learned that he was the right age to portray Waymond. Coincidentally, Quan had returned to acting, inspired by the success of *Crazy Rich Asians* (2018), soon before he was approached for the role.[34] This is a result of a domino effect where the director Jon M. Chu was inspired to create *Crazy Rich Asians* because of #StarringJohnCho, a movement about Asian representation in leading roles in Hollywood.[35] Jeff Cohen, Quan's former co-star from *The Goonies* (1985), was his attorney to negotiate his contract.[36]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\nPrincipal photography began in January 2020, with A24 announcing that it would finance and distribute the film.[33] Around this time, Kwan and Schneirt were invited by Marvel Studios to discuss the possibility of them developing the first season of the Disney+ series *Loki*, which also deals with a storyline involving the multiverse, but the duo, already not really interested in the project, declined as they were about to start shooting their own movie about the same concept.[37] Shooting took 38 days,[38] mostly in Simi Valley, California.[39] Much of the film was shot overcranked at a very high frame rate to accommodate extensive time remapping in post production.[40] The Daniels said the kung-fu fight scenes were shot unusually quickly; for example, the fanny-pack fight was shot in a day and a half.[41] Filming wrapped in early March 2020, during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.[42] The first cut ran around 170 minutes.[40]\n\n\n\n### Visual effects[edit]\n\n\nVisual effects post-production for the film was done in-house, after the Daniels' negative experience with a dedicated post-production studio for their previous film *Swiss Army Man*.[43] Instead, the filmmakers assembled a small team of five artists headed by Zak Stoltz, who produced all visual effects using Adobe After Effects, Adobe Premiere Pro, and used Resilio Sync to share the large amounts of data once the pandemic hit.[43]\n\n\nFor Deirdre's appearance, Kwan discovered a picture of a real IRS agent he found online, which Curtis liked and wanted to emulate. Curtis wanted the character to be as \"real\" as possible and used her real belly for the film, as opposed to a prosthetic.[44]\n\n\n\n## Themes[edit]\n\n\n*Everything Everywhere All at Once* incorporates elements from a number of genres and film mediums, including surreal comedy, science fiction, fantasy, martial arts films and animation.[5][6][7] A. O. Scott of *The New York Times* described the film as a \"swirl of genre anarchy\", explaining that \"while the hectic action sequences and flights of science-fiction mumbo-jumbo are a big part of the fun (and the marketing), they aren't really the point. [It is] a bittersweet domestic drama, a marital comedy, a story of immigrant striving and a hurt-filled ballad of mother-daughter love\".[7] Laura Zornosa from *The New York Times* elaborates its addressing of intergenerational trauma through healing relationships. Additionally, Emily St. James wrote on Vox that the film is part of a rising subgenre of \"millennial parental apology fantasy\", imagining worlds in which parents and children reconcile.[45]\n\n\nAccording to Charles Bramesco of *The Guardian*, \"The bagel of doom and its tightening grip on Evelyn's daughter lend themselves to the climactic declaration that there's nothing worse than submitting to the nihilism so trendy with the next generation. Our lone hope of recourse is to embrace all the love and beauty surrounding us, if only we're present enough to see it.\"[46] This nihilism is also incorporated into the film's exploration of Asian American identity. Anne Anlin Cheng wrote in *The Washington Post,* \"It's not only that the multiverse acts as a metaphor for the immigrant Asian experience, or a convenient parable for the dislocations and personality splits suffered by hyphenated (that is, 'Asian-American') citizens, including LGBT culture. It also becomes a rather heady vehicle for confronting and negotiating Asian-pessimism\", a term she uses in reference to Afro-pessimism.[47]\n\n\n*Consequence*'s Clint Worthington wrote that \"for all its dadaist absurdism and blink-if-you-miss-it pace, Daniels weaves the chaotic possibilities into the multiverse into a cohesive story about the travails of the road not traveled, and the need to carve out your own meaning in a meaningless universe.\"[48] Describing Jobu Tupaki's modus operandi, Worthington notes \"the living contradiction that is the everything bagel: if you put everything on a bagel, what more is left? And if you've experienced everything that the multiverse can offer, what's the point of any of it?\"[48] Kwan said that the everything bagel concept \"did two things. It allowed us to talk about nihilism without being too eye roll-y. And it creates a MacGuffin: a doomsday device. If, in the first half of the movie, people think that the bagel is here to destroy the world, and in the second half you realize it's a depressed person trying to destroy themselves, it just takes everything about action movies and turns it into something more personal.\"[19] The writer George Gillett argues that the movie is \"a coming-of-age film for the internet generation\", with the multiverse resembling virtual environments which viewers increasingly exist within.[49]\n\n\nThe film engages textually and metatextually with the \"real world\" of the viewer.[50][51] Critics have noted that one version of Evelyn—a famous martial arts movie star—is a portrayal of Yeoh,[51][52][53] that Ke Huy Quan's experience as a stunt coordinator is used diegetically in Waymond's fight scenes,[54] and that James Hong's transformation into \"a more sinister, English-fluent, Machiavellian strategist\" parallels his character Lo Pan in *Big Trouble in Little China* (1986).[50][55]\n\n\n\n## Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Everything Everywhere All at Once* (soundtrack)\n\n![](image)Experimental band Son Lux composed the score.\nThe musical score was composed by Son Lux, whose members are Ryan Lott, Ian Chang, and Rafiq Bhatia.[56] Daniels asked them to approach the score individually, and not as a band. Lott said, \"I think that the complete picture of not only who we are as a band, but also who we are as individuals and what we have accomplished and the places we've gone creatively individually, meant for them that there was a possibility that many of these universes of sound could be within reach with this particular trio.\"[57]\n\n\nSon Lux took two to three years to compose the score, which includes more than a hundred musical cues.[58] The soundtrack album consists of 49 tracks and runs for more than two hours. It features several prominent musicians,[59] including Mitski, David Byrne, a flute-playing André 3000, Randy Newman, Moses Sumney, Hajnal Pivnick, and yMusic.[25][60][61] Two songs—\"This Is a Life\" featuring Mitski and Byrne[62] and \"Fence\" featuring Sumney—were released as singles on March 4 and 14, 2022.[63] The album was released on March 25 to positive critical response.[64][65]\n\n\nThe film features several instances, both in audio and in dialogue, of the 2000 Nine Days song \"Absolutely (Story of a Girl)\". When Daniels contacted Nine Days vocalist John Hampson about using the song, Hampson enthusiastically agreed to record three alternate versions of the song for use in the film.[66][67]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\nThe world premiere was at the South by Southwest film festival on March 11, 2022.[68] Its limited release in theaters was on March 25, 2022,[69] and its nationwide release was on April 8, in the United States by A24.[70] On March 30, 2022, the film was released in select IMAX theaters in the U.S. for one night only. Due to its popularity, the film returned to select IMAX theaters for one week starting on April 29, 2022.[71][72] The film was not released in most parts of the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, due to censorship of LGBT issues in those countries.[73] The film was released in the United Kingdom on May 13, 2022.[74] The film was re-released in U.S. theaters on July 29, 2022, unchanged but adding an introduction by Daniels and eight minutes of outtakes after the credits.[75][76] It was re-released again in U.S. theaters on January 27, 2023, on 1,400 screens to celebrate its Oscar nominations.[77][78]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\nThe film was released on digital streaming platforms on June 7, 2022, and was released on Blu-ray, DVD, and Ultra HD Blu-ray on July 5, 2022, by Lionsgate Home Entertainment.[79][80]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n*Everything Everywhere All at Once* grossed $77.2 million in the United States and Canada and $64 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $141.2 million.[4] *Deadline Hollywood* calculated the net profit of the film to be $32 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues.[81]\n\n\nIn the United States and Canada, the film earned $509,600 from ten venues in its opening weekend. Its debut had a theater average of $50,965, the second-best since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic for a platform release (behind *Licorice Pizza*) and the then-best opening theater average in 2022.[82] In its second weekend, the film grossed $1.1 million from 38 theaters, finishing ninth at the box office.[83] It received a wide expansion in its third weekend, going from 38 to 1,250 theaters.[84][85] It made $6.1 million, finishing sixth at the box office.[86][87] Playing in 2,220 theaters the following weekend, it earned $6.2 million, finishing fourth.[88] In its sixth weekend, it added $5.5 million, part of which was attributed to a wider IMAX release following its successful box office run until then.[5] It added $3.5 million in its seventh weekend,[89] and another $3.3 million in its eighth.[90] By May 21, it had made over $51 million, surpassing *Uncut Gems* ($50 million) as A24's highest-grossing film domestically.[91] By June 9, it had made over $80 million, surpassing *Hereditary* ($79 million) as A24's highest-grossing film of all time.[92] It remained in the box office top ten until its sixteenth weekend, which ended on July 10.[93] The film crossed the $100 million mark worldwide on July 31, making it the first independent film released during the pandemic (and in A24's history) to achieve this distinction.[2]\n\n\nOutside of the United States, other top-earning territories as of July 31 were the United Kingdom ($6.2 million), Canada ($5.1 million), Australia ($4.5 million), Russia ($2.4 million), Taiwan ($2.3 million), Mexico ($2 million), Hong Kong ($1.7 million), Germany ($1.5 million), and the Netherlands ($1.1 million).[2]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Michelle Yeoh won the Academy Award for Best Actress, with some reviewers calling her performance the best of her career.\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 94% of 405 critic reviews are positive for the film and the average rating is 8.5/10. The website's consensus reads, \"Led by an outstanding Michelle Yeoh, *Everything Everywhere All at Once* lives up to its title with an expertly calibrated assault on the senses.\"[94] Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 81 out of 100, based on 55 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[95] Audiences polled by PostTrak gave it an 89% positive score, with 77% saying that they would definitely recommend it.[86]\n\n\nDavid Ehrlich of IndieWire called the film an \"orgiastic work of slaphappy genius\", praising the direction and performances, particularly Yeoh's, calling it the \"greatest performance that Michelle Yeoh has ever given\".[96] *The Hollywood Reporter'*s David Rooney called it a \"frenetically plotted serve of stoner heaven [that] is insanely imaginative and often a lot of fun\", complimenting the cast and score but found the handling of the story's underlying theme underwhelming.[97] In her review for *RogerEbert.com*, Marya E. Gates lauded Yeoh's performance, writing, \"Yeoh is the anchor of the film, given a role that showcases her wide range of talents, from her fine martial art skills to her superb comic timing to her ability to excavate endless depths of rich human emotion, often just from a glance or a reaction.\"[98] Bramesco praised the Daniels for constructing a \"large, elaborate, polished, and detailed expression of a vision,\"[46] Amy Nicholson of *The Wall Street Journal* wrote, \"Over its nearly two-and-a-half-hour running time, the movie's ambitions double, and double again, as though it's a petri dish teeming with Mr. Kwan and Mr. Scheinert's wildest ideas.\"[18]\n\n\nSome reviewers called Yeoh's performance as the best of her career.[99][100][101] In her review for *Vanity Fair*, Maureen Ryan highlighted it, writing, \"Yeoh imbues Evelyn with moving shades of melancholy, regret, resolve, and growing curiosity\" and adding that she \"makes her embrace of lead-character energy positively gripping.\"[102] Adam Nayman of *The Ringer* referred to the film as \"a love letter to Yeoh [and] extremely poignant, giving its 59-year-old star a chance to flex unexpected acting muscles while revisiting the high-flying fight choreography that made her a global icon back in the 1990s\".[103] In his review for the *Chicago Sun-Times*, Jake Coyle wrote that although it \"can verge on overload, it's this liberating sense of limitless possibility that the movie leaves you filled with, both in its freewheeling anything-goes playfulness and in its surprisingly tender portrait of existential despair\".[104] Tasha Robinson of *Polygon* named the scene of Evelyn and Joy Wang as rocks with their dialogue appearing as on-screen subtitles, all while trying to find common ground, as one of the best movie scenes of 2022, saying \"...it's a perfect moment. Like so many *EEAAO* sequences, it turns between emotions on a dime. But the quiet of the moment is essential. Out of context, it's just an odd moment between rocks. But within the context of the film, it's a breather the audience and characters both desperately need, and the emotions are so heightened that just the sight of rock-Joy and rock-Evelyn sharing a companionable laugh is remarkably heartening and hilarious.\"[105]\n\n\nDissenting reviews include that of Richard Brody for *The New Yorker*, who dismissed it as a \"sickly cynical feature-length directorial pitch reel for a Marvel movie\",[106] and that of Peter Bradshaw for *The Guardian* who described it as \"a formless splurge of Nothing Nowhere Over a Long Period of Time\".[107]\n\n\nArmond White of *National Review* wrote: \"Unschooled Marvel addicts who never heard of Kafka, Buñuel, or Chuck Jones easily fall for the entropy farce. The Daniels refuse narrative convention in order to represent our culture's gradual decline into disorder.... The film's ultimate message: \"Be Kind,\" spoken by two rocks. It's a childish palliative.... Yeoh brings adult stability to the blackout-skit chaos and cast of \"stupid human\" clowns. But the Daniels reduce life to \"just a statistical inevitability, it's nothing special.\"\"[108]\n\n\n*The New York Times* named the character Jobu Tupaki, played by Hsu, one of the 93 Most Stylish \"People\" of 2022.[109]\n\n\n\n### Legacy[edit]\n\n\nIn 2023, *Screen Rant* ranked it as the \"Best Movie of the 2020s (So Far),\" calling it the \"best, most exciting movie\" on the subject matter of the multiverse and a \"turning point after the box-office-slumping COVID-19 pandemic and superhero-centric 2010s.\"[110] The site also included it on its list of films from the decade that are \"Destined To Become Classics,\" calling it \"both a massively entertaining sci-fi actioner and a deeply affecting family drama.\"[111] It also ranked number 2 on *MovieWeb*'s list of the \"Best LGBTQ+ Movies of the 2020s (So Far)\" and number 13 on the its list of \"20 Movies That Require Your Full Attention From Start to Finish.\" For the latter list, Taryn Flaherty wrote, \"...there is not a second of this 139-minute eccentric film that does not demand your dedicated attention. With the multiverse driving the story's narrative forward, it should come as no surprise that every detail of this film will require its viewer to remain focused.\"[112][113] *IndieWire* ranked it at number 8 on its list of the \"50 Best Action Movies of the 21st Century\" and number 5 on its list of the \"55 Best Science Fiction Films of the 21st Century.\"[114][115] It also ranked number 33 on *Comic Book Resources*' list of \"The Best Movies of All Time.\"[116]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by *Everything Everywhere All at Once*\n\nPrior to the 95th Academy Awards, *IGN* reported that *Everything Everywhere All at Once* had already surpassed *The Lord of The Rings: The Return of the King* (2003) as \"the most awarded film of all time\".[9][117]\n\n\nIt won seven of its 11 Academy Award nominations: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress (Yeoh), Best Supporting Actor (Quan), Best Supporting Actress (Curtis), Best Original Screenplay and Best Film Editing.[118][119] The film received 10 BAFTA nominations (winning one),[120] 13 Critics' Choice Movie Awards nominations (winning five),[121] eight Independent Spirit Awards nominations (winning a record-breaking seven),[122] and six Golden Globe Awards nominations (winning two).[123] It was named one of the top 10 films of 2022 by the National Board of Review and the American Film Institute.[124][125] The film also won top prizes from the Directors Guild of America Awards, Producers Guild of America Awards, Writers Guild of America Awards, and Screen Actors Guild Awards (the last of which it won a record-breaking four awards);[126] the film became the 5th film to sweep all four top prizes from the major guilds (DGA, PGA, WGA, SAG), after *American Beauty*, *No Country for Old Men*, *Slumdog Millionaire*, and *Argo* (all 5 films ended up winning Best Picture at their respective Academy Awards).[127]\n\n\n*Everything Everywhere All at Once* made Academy Awards history in several categories. Yeoh was the first woman of Chinese ethnicity to win Best Actress, the second woman of color after Halle Berry in 2002, and the first Malaysian to win any Academy Award. Stephanie Hsu's nomination in the Best Supporting Actress category, alongside Hong Chau's nomination for *The Whale*, marked the first time two actresses of Asian ethnicity were nominated in that category in the same year. Ke Huy Quan is the first Vietnam-born actor to win an Academy Award. It is also the first science-fiction film to win Best Picture,[128] and the first science-fiction film to win five of the top six Academy Awards. While no film has ever won in all four acting categories, it was the third to win three out of four, after *A Streetcar Named Desire* (1951) and *Network* (1976),[129] and the first to also win Best Picture.[130]\n\n\nThe reaction to the film's Best Picture win was not without criticism, with Justin Chang of the *Los Angeles Times* feeling that the Academy \"chose the wrong best picture\" and believed that now, as a result, \"films that enter the race reeking too obviously of traditional Oscar quality — a group that includes not only *The Fabelmans* but also two earlier Spielberg pictures, *The Post* and *West Side Story* — run the risk of falling by the wayside,\" and compared its win to that of *CODA* at the previous ceremony.[131] Cannes Film Festival president Thierry Frémaux was also happy with the result but felt mixed, saying: \"I thought the ceremony was very good and I was happy to see Michelle Yeoh rewarded. And disappointed that Steven Spielberg wasn't, because his film is a love letter to cinema.\"[132]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Asian Americans in arts and entertainment\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\". *British Board of Film Classification*.

Based on the 2017 nonfiction book *Nomadland: Surviving America in the Twenty-First Century* by Jessica Bruder, it stars Frances McDormand as a widow who leaves to travel around the United States in her van as a nomad. David Strathairn also stars in a supporting role. A number of real-life nomads appear as fictionalized versions of themselves, including Linda May, Swankie and Bob Wells.\n\n\n*Nomadland* premiered on September 11, 2020, at the Venice Film Festival, where it won the Golden Lion. It also won the People's Choice Award at the Toronto International Film Festival. It had a one-week streaming limited release on December 4, 2020, and was distributed by Searchlight Pictures in selected IMAX theaters in the United States on January 29, 2021, and simultaneously in theaters, and streaming digitally on Hulu, on February 19, 2021. The film was a box office success, grossing $39 million worldwide against its $5 million budget and received widespread critical acclaim for its direction, editing, screenplay and cinematography, as well as the performances of McDormand and Strathairn. It was the third-highest rated film of 2020 on Metacritic,[7] which found it to be the most frequently ranked by critics and publications as one of the best films of the year.\n\n\nAt the 93rd Academy Awards, it won Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actress for McDormand, from a total of six nominations.[8] Zhao became the first Asian woman and the second woman ever to win Best Director; McDormand became the first woman and fourth person to win Academy Awards for both acting and producing, and the first person ever to win Academy Awards as producer and performer for the same film.[9] It is also the first Searchlight release to win Best Picture since the studio's ownership under Walt Disney Studios, following Disney's acquisition of the 21st Century Fox assets. It also won Best Motion Picture – Drama and Best Director at the 78th Golden Globe Awards,[10] four awards including Best Film at the 74th British Academy Film Awards,[11] and four awards including Best Film at the 36th Independent Spirit Awards.[12] It has since been cited as one of the best films of the 21st century.[13][14][15]\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn 2011, Fern loses her job after the US Gypsum plant in Empire, Nevada, shuts down; she had worked there for years along with her husband, who recently died. Fern sells most of her belongings and purchases a van to live in and travel the country searching for work. She takes a seasonal job at an Amazon fulfillment center through the winter.\n\n\nLinda, a friend and co-worker, invites Fern to visit a desert rendezvous in Arizona organized by Bob Wells, which provides a support system and community for fellow nomads. Fern initially declines, but changes her mind as the weather turns cold and she struggles to find work in the area. There, Fern meets fellow nomads and learns basic survival and self-sufficiency skills for the road.\n\n\nWhen Fern's van blows a tire, she visits the van of a nearby nomad, Swankie, to ask for a ride into town to buy a spare. Swankie chastises Fern for not being prepared and invites her to learn road survival skills; they become friends. Swankie tells Fern about her cancer diagnosis and shortened life expectancy and her plan to make good memories on the road rather than waste away in a hospital. They eventually part ways.\n\n\nFern takes a job as a camp host at the Cedar Pass Campgrounds in Badlands National Park in South Dakota. Also working there is Dave, another nomad she met and danced with at the desert community. When he falls ill with diverticulitis, Fern visits him at the hospital where he has had emergency surgery. They take restaurant jobs at Wall Drug in South Dakota. One night, Dave's son visits the restaurant looking for him, telling him that his wife is pregnant and asking him to meet his grandchild. He is hesitant, but Fern encourages him to go. Dave suggests that she come with him, but she declines.\n\n\nFern takes a new job at a sugar beet processing plant, but her van breaks down, and she cannot afford the repairs. Unable to borrow money, she visits her sister's family at their home in California. Fern's sister lends her the money to get the van fixed. She questions why Fern was never around in their lives and why Fern stayed in Empire after her husband died, but she tells Fern that she is brave to be so independent. Fern later visits Dave and his son's family in Point Arena, California, learning that Dave has decided to stay with them long-term. He admits to having feelings for her and invites her to stay with him permanently in a guest house, but she decides to leave after only a few days, heading to the ocean.\n\n\nFern returns to her seasonal Amazon job and later revisits the Arizona rendezvous. There, she learns that Swankie has died, and she and the other nomads pay tribute to her life by tossing stones into the campfire. Fern opens up to Bob about her loving relationship with her late husband, and he shares the story of his son's suicide. Bob espouses the view that goodbyes are not final in the nomad community as its members always promise to see each other again \"down the road\".\n\n\nFern returns to the nearly abandoned town of Empire to dispose of the belongings she has been keeping in a storage unit. She visits the factory and the home she shared with her husband before returning to the road.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n* Frances McDormand as Fern\n* David Strathairn as Dave\n* Linda May as Linda\n* Charlene Swankie as Swankie\n* Bob Wells as Bob Wells\n* Peter Spears as Peter\n* Derek Endres as Derek\n* Tay Strathairn as James\n* Gay DeForest as Gay\n* Patricia Grier as Patty\n* Angela Reyes as Angela\n* Carl R.

McDormand, Spears, Mollye Asher, Dan Janvey, and Zhao produced the film.[19]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\nSearchlight Pictures acquired the worldwide distribution rights for *Nomadland* in February 2019.[20] The film had its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival on September 11, 2020, and screened at the Toronto International Film Festival on the same day.[21] At Venice, the film won several awards, including the festival's top honor, the Golden Lion.[22][23] At Toronto, the film won the People's Choice Award.[24] It is the first film to win the top prize at both Venice and Toronto.[25]\n\n\nIn association with Searchlight, Film at Lincoln Center held exclusive virtual screenings of the film for one week only beginning on December 4, 2020, the film's initial release date before Searchlight delayed it to February 19, 2021, due to concerns of the COVID-19 pandemic.[26][27] It was released in IMAX theaters on January 29, 2021, with a wide theatrical and drive-in release in the United States on February 19, and streaming on Hulu the same day.[28] A two-week preview season in certain regions of Australia and New Zealand began on December 26, 2020, before a wider release on March 4, 2021.[29]\n\n\nInternationally, the film is also available on Disney+ and Disney+ Hotstar. The release date on Disney+ was April 9, 2021 in Canada, and April 30, 2021, in most other countries.[30][31][32] Although originally scheduled for a limited release in China starting on April 23, 2021,[33] the film has still not been shown in any theaters there.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n*Nomadland* was released on Blu-ray and digital streaming services on April 27, 2021, by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment.[34]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n*Nomadland* grossed $3.7 million in the United States and Canada, and $35.4 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $39.1 million.[5][6]\n\n\nAlthough Searchlight did not publicly release *Nomadland'*s grosses, it was released in North America the same day as *The Little Things*, and sources estimated a gross of $170,000 from its two-week IMAX run, then $503,000 from 1,175 theaters in its wide opening weekend on February 19, for a total of $673,000. Social media monitor RelishMix noted online response was \"mixed-to-leaning-positive\" among audiences.[35] In its second wide release weekend, it earned an estimated $330,000 from 1,200 theaters, for a four-week running total of $1.1 million.[36]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Frances McDormand's performance received critical acclaim and won her the Academy Award for Best Actress.\nReview aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 93% of 436 critic reviews were positive, with an average rating of 8.8/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"A poetic character study on the forgotten and downtrodden, *Nomadland* beautifully captures the restlessness left in the wake of the Great Recession.\"[37] According to Metacritic, which assigned it a weighted average score of 89 out of 100 based on 55 critics, the film received \"universal acclaim\".[38]\n\n\nWriting for *The Hollywood Reporter*, David Rooney called the film a \"powerful character study\", and added, \"Like Zhao's earlier work, *Nomadland* is an unassuming film, its aptly meandering, unhurried non-narrative layering impressions rather than building a story with the standard markers. But the cumulative effect of its many quiet, seemingly inconsequential encounters and moments of solitary contemplation is a unique portrait of outsider existence.\"[1] Adrian Horton of *The Guardian* gave the film a positive review, stating, \"*Nomadland* has garnered industry praise as a likely frontrunner for the best picture Oscar ... The word of mouth is warranted.\"[39] A.O. Scott of *The New York Times* similarly gave a positive review, writing \"It's like discovering a new country, one you may want to visit more than once.\"[40] Eric Kohn of IndieWire gave the film an \"A−\" and said, \"director Chloé Zhao works magic with McDormand's face and the real world around it, delivering a profound rumination on the impulse to leave society in the dust.\"[41] Some reviewers felt the film idealized financial despair. Critic Tim Brayton called it \"108 minutes of poverty tourism\",[42] while WBUR's Sean Burns wrote \"Zhao has made *The Grapes of Wrath* without the wrath\".[43]\n\n\nIndieWire's poll of 231 critics included *Nomadland* in its Best Movies of 2020.[44] According to Metacritic, the film was ranked the best of 2020 by critics more often than any other.[45] In 2021, it was included on *Forbes*'s list of \"The Top 150 Greatest Films Of The 21st Century.\"[14] In 2022, it ranked number 10 on *Time Out*'s list of \"The 100 Best Movies of the 21st century So Far,\" saying that the film \"expertly stitches together realism, moments of sheer transcendence and a lightly-worn radicalism in a way that feels nothing but unpatronizing and empathetic.\"[13] In August 2023, *Collider* ranked the film at number 13 on its list of \"The 20 Best Drama Movies of the 2020s So Far,\" calling it \"a moving portrayal of the American nomadic lifestyle\" and praised the lead character of Fern as \"endearing ... because of her self-confidence, but it never feels like she’s attempting to impose her choice of lifestyle on anyone else.\"[15]\n\n\n\n### Reaction in China[edit]\n\n\nZhao and the film's success prior to and leading up to the Golden Globes and the Oscars were initially praised on Chinese social media outlets, as well as official state-controlled news media.[46][47][48]\n\n\nAfter the Golden Globes, Zhao was scrutinized by Chinese netizens over her remarks in a 2013 interview for *Filmmaker* magazine, in which she described China as \"a place where there are lies everywhere\". In response to the controversy, *Nomadland* was pulled from theatrical release by Disney China, and the 93rd Academy Awards were censored by Chinese media outlets along with all mention of Zhao or the film on social media.[49][50]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by Nomadland\n\n*Nomadland* won the Golden Lion upon premiering at the Venice Film Festival, and also won the People's Choice Award at the Toronto International Film Festival.[51][52][53] It received four nominations at the 78th Golden Globe Awards, winning Best Motion Picture – Drama and Best Director; in winning the latter award, Zhao became the second woman and the first East Asian woman to do so.[10][54] It received five nominations at the 36th Independent Spirit Awards and six nominations at the 26th Critics' Choice Awards, winning four awards including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay.[55][56] At the 27th Screen Actors Guild Awards, McDormand received a nomination for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role.[57]\nThe film won the BAFTA Award for Best Film in 2021.[58][59] The film received six nominations at the 93rd Academy Awards, winning Best Director[60] (with Zhao becoming the second woman and first non-white woman to do so),[61] Best Picture,[62] and Best Actress awards in 2021.[63] Both the National Board of Review and the American Film Institute named *Nomadland* as one of the top 10 films of 2020.[64][65]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Empire, Nevada\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Rooney, David (September 11, 2020). \"'Nomadland': Film Review Venice 2020\". *The Hollywood Reporter*.

The film, starring Song Kang-ho, Lee Sun-kyun, Cho Yeo-jeong, Choi Woo-shik, Park So-dam, Jang Hye-jin, Park Myung-hoon and Lee Jung-eun, follows a poor family who scheme to become employed by a wealthy family, infiltrating their household by posing as unrelated, highly qualified individuals.\n\n\nThe script is based on Bong's source material from a play written in 2013. He later adapted it into a 15-page film draft, and it was split into three different drafts by Han. Bong stated that he was inspired by the 1960 Korean film *The Housemaid*, and by the Christine and Léa Papin incident in the 1930s. Filming began in May 2018 and finished that September. The project included cinematographer Hong Kyung-pyo, film editor Yang Jin-mo, and composer Jung Jae-il. Darcy Paquet, an American film critic and author, provided English translations for the film's international release.\n\n\n*Parasite* premiered at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival on 21 May 2019, where it became the first Korean film to win its top prize, the Palme d'Or. It was released in South Korea by CJ Entertainment on 30 May, and was praised for Bong's direction and screenplay, and also for its editing and production design. It grossed over $263 million worldwide on a $15.5 million budget. \n\n\nAmong its numerous accolades, *Parasite* won the leading four Academy Awards at the 92nd Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best International Feature Film, becoming the first non English-language film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture.[note 1] It is the first South Korean film to receive any Academy Award recognition, and one of only three films overall to win both the Palme d'Or and the Academy Award for Best Picture, the first such achievement in over 60 years.[note 2] It won the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film and the BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language, and became the first non English-language film to win the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. It has since been cited as among the best films of the 2010s, the 21st century, and of all time.[10][11] A television series based on it is in early development.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nThe Kim family lives in a semi-basement flat (*banjiha*) in Seoul, have low-income jobs, and struggle for money. Min-hyuk, a university student, gives the family a scholar's rock meant to promise wealth. Leaving to study abroad, he suggests that the Kims' son, Ki-woo, pose as a university student to take over his job as an English language tutor for Da-hye, the daughter of the rich Park family. After his sister Ki-jung helps create a false certificate for him in Photoshop, Ki-woo, posing as a Yonsei University student, is subsequently hired by the Park family.\n\n\nThe Kim family schemes to get each member a job with the Park family. Ki-woo recommends \"Jessica\", actually his sister Ki-jung, as an art therapist for the Parks' young son, Da-song, who has been traumatised after seeing a \"ghost\" in their kitchen. Ki-jung frames Yoon, Mr Park's chauffeur, by making it appear he had a sexual encounter in the car, then recommends her relatives' chauffeur, in actuality her father, Ki-taek, to take his place. The Kims exploit the peach allergy of the Parks' long-time housekeeper, Moon-gwang, to convince Mrs Park that she has tuberculosis, and the Kim matriarch, Chung-sook, is hired as her replacement. Ki-woo begins a secret romantic relationship with Da-hye.\n\n\nWhen the Parks leave on a camping trip, the Kims revel in the luxuries of the house. Moon-gwang appears at the door, telling Chung-sook she left something in the basement. She goes through a hidden entrance to an underground bunker created by the architect and previous homeowner (who was too embarrassed to inform the Park family of its existence). There, Moon-gwang's husband Geun-sae is revealed to be living in the bunker while hiding from loan sharks; he is also revealed to be the \"ghost\", whom Da-song saw attempting to come out of the bunker to steal groceries from the Parks' refrigerator. Chung-sook refuses Moon-gwang's pleas to allow Geun-sae remain in the bunker in exchange for regular payments, but the three other eavesdropping Kims accidentally reveal themselves to be related. Moon-gwang videotapes them on her phone inadvertently revealing their deception and threatens to expose them to the Park family.\n\n\nThe Parks call to say that they are returning early due to a severe rainstorm. The Kims subdue Moon-gwang and Geun-sae, tying them up and hiding them in the bunker. Ki-jung, Ki-taek and Ki-woo hide under a table, and overhear Mr Park's comments about Ki-taek's odour, one he associates with lower-class people. The Kims eventually escape, but the torrential rain floods their flat with sewer water, forcing them to take shelter in a gymnasium with other, similarly displaced people.\n\n\nThe next day, Mrs Park hosts a house party for Da-song's birthday with the elder Kims' assistance; the younger Kims are invited as guests. Ki-woo enters the bunker with his scholar's rock to kill Geun-sae and Moon-gwang. Moon-gwang is already dead from a concussion she received during yesterday's brawl, but Ki-woo is attacked by Geun-sae, who uses the rock to knock Ki-woo out, leaving him lying in a pool of blood in the basement. Geun-sae then stabs Ki-jung with a kitchen knife in front of the horrified guests. Da-song suffers another seizure upon seeing Geun-sae again. Geun-sae and Chung-sook grapple with each other; she fatally impales him with a barbecue skewer. While Ki-taek tends to Ki-jung, Mr Park orders Ki-taek to drive Da-song to the hospital. In the chaos, Ki-taek, upon seeing Mr Park's disgusted reaction to Geun-sae's odour, angrily kills him with the knife, then flees.\n\n\nWeeks later, Ki-woo is recovering from a brain operation. He and Chung-sook are convicted of fraud and put on probation. Ki-jung has died from her injury, while Ki-taek cannot be found. Geun-sae is assumed to have been an insane homeless man, and neither his nor Ki-taek's motive for the murders are known. Ki-woo spies on the Parks' former home, now owned by a German family, and sees a message in Morse code from a kitchen light. Ki-taek, hiding in the bunker, has buried Moon-gwang in the garden and sends the message every day, hoping Ki-woo will see it. Still living in their basement flat with his mother, Ki-woo writes a letter to Ki-taek, vowing to earn enough money to buy the house and free him.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n* Song Kang-ho as Kim Ki-taek (Mr Kim; 김기택; *Gim Gitaek*), the Kim family father who is hired as Park Dong-ik's chauffeur\n* Lee Sun-kyun as Park Dong-ik (Nathan; 박동익; *Bak Dongik*), the Park family father\n* Cho Yeo-jeong as Choi Yeon-gyo (Madame; 최연교; *Choe Yeongyo*), the Park mother\n* Choi Woo-shik as Kim Ki-woo (Kevin; 김기우; *Gim Giu*), the Kims' son who is hired as Da-hye's English tutor (Choi stated that the character is \"intelligent but does not have the vigour needed to succeed in examinations\")[12]\n* Park So-dam as Kim Ki-jung (Jessica; 김기정; *Gim Gijeong*), the Kims' daughter who is hired as Da-song's art therapist\n* Jang Hye-jin as Chung-sook (박충숙; *Bak Chungsuk*), the Kim family mother who is hired as the Parks' housekeeper\n* Lee Jung-eun as Gook Moon-gwang (국문광; *Guk Mungwang*), the Parks' housekeeper, who also worked for the house's architect and previous owner of the house (Bong Joon-ho said her relationship with the architect and parts of her story \"that happen in between the sequences in the film\" will be explored in the spin-off TV series)[13]\n* Park Myung-hoon as Oh Geun-sae (오근세; *O Geunse*), Moon-gwang's husband\n* Jung Ji-so as Park Da-hye (박다혜; *Bak Dahye*), the Parks' daughter\n* Jung Hyeon-jun as Park Da-song (박다송; *Bak Dasong*), the Parks' son\n* Park Keun-rok as Yoon (윤; *Yun*), Park Dong-ik's chauffeur\n* Park Seo-joon as Min-hyuk (민혁; *Minhyeok*), Ki-woo's friend[14]\n* Jung Yi-seo as a pizza parlour owner\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\nThe idea for *Parasite* originated in 2013. While working on *Snowpiercer*, Bong was encouraged by a theatre actor friend to write a play. He had been a tutor for the son of a wealthy family in Seoul in his early 20s and considered turning his experience into a stage production.[15] The film's title, *Parasite*, was selected by Bong as it served a double meaning, which he had to convince the film's marketing group to use. Bong said \"Because the story is about the poor family infiltrating and creeping into the rich house, it seems very obvious that *Parasite* refers to the poor family, and I think that's why the marketing team was a little hesitant. But if you look at it the other way, you can say that rich family, they're also parasites in terms of labor. They can't even wash dishes, they can't drive themselves, so they leech off the poor family's labor. So both are parasites.\"[16]\n\n\n\n### Writing[edit]\n\n\nAfter completing *Snowpiercer*, Bong wrote a 15-page film treatment for the first half of *Parasite*, which his production assistant on *Snowpiercer*, Han Jin-won, turned into three different drafts of the screenplay.[15] After finishing *Okja*, Bong returned to the project and finished the script. Han Jin-won received credit as a co-writer.[15]\n\n\nBong said the film was influenced by the 1960 Korean \"domestic Gothic\" film *The Housemaid* in which a middle-class family's stability is threatened by the arrival of a disruptive interloper in the form of household help.[17] The incident of Christine and Léa Papin—two live-in maids who murdered their employers in 1930s France—also inspired him.[18] Bong also considered his own past, where he had tutored for a rich family. Bong said \"I got this feeling that I was infiltrating the private lives of complete strangers. Every week I would go into their house, and I thought how fun it would be if I could get all my friends to infiltrate the house one by one.\"[19] Additionally, Moon-gwang's allergy to peaches was inspired by one of Bong's university friends having this allergy.[20]\n\n\nDarcy Paquet, an American residing in South Korea, translated the English subtitles, writing directly with Bong.[21] Paquet rendered Jjapaguri or Chapaguri, a dish cooked by a character in the film, as *ram-don*, meaning ramen-udon. It is a mix of Chapagetti and Neoguri produced by Nongshim.[22] The English version of the film shows packages labelled in English \"ramyeon\" and \"udon\" to highlight to English speakers how the name was created. Paquet believed the word *ram-don* did not previously exist as he found no results on Google.[23] On one occasion, Paquet used Oxford University as a reference instead of Seoul National University, and in another, used WhatsApp as the messaging application instead of KakaoTalk.[21] Paquet chose Oxford over Harvard because of Bong's affinity for the United Kingdom, and because Paquet believed using Harvard would be \"too obvious a choice\".[23] Paquet wrote, \"In order for humor to work, people need to understand it immediately. With an unfamiliar word, the humor is lost.\"[23]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Parasite filming location at Jahamun Tunnel in Seoul.\nPrincipal photography for *Parasite* began on 18 May 2018,[24][25] and ended on 19 September 2018.[26] Filming took place around Seoul and in Jeonju.[27] The director of photography was Hong Kyung-pyo, a well-known South Korean cinematographer who had worked with other well-known directors.[28]\n\n\n\n#### The Parks' house[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The house was constructed on a set and everything above the first floor was added in post-production.\nThe Parks' house was a specially constructed set. The ground floor and the garden were constructed on an empty outdoor lot, while the basement and first floor were constructed on set.[29] \"We built the main floor of the house in a backlot and for the second floor it was all green screen outside\", explained editor Yang Jin-mo. \"When we shot toward the outside from inside, everything beyond the garden was all VFX.\"[30]\n\n\nBong, as part of the scripting, also designed the home's basic layout. \"It's like its own universe inside this film. Each character and each team has spaces that they take over, that they can infiltrate, and also secret spaces that they don't know.\"[31] A fictional architect, Namgoong Hyeonja, was created as the home's designer and previous owner before the Parks, and production designer Lee Ha-jun considered the house's form and function based on how Namgoong would design it.[29] It was designed and constructed to be not only beautiful, but \"a stage that served the precise needs of his camera, compositions, and characters, while embodying his film's rich themes\".[32]\n\n\nLee said, \"Since Mr Park's house is built by an architect in the story, it wasn't easy finding the right approach to designing the house...I'm not an architect, and I think there's a difference in how an architect envisions a space and how a production designer does. We prioritize blocking and camera angles while architects build spaces for people to actually live in and thus design around people. So I think the approach is very different.\"[31] For example, Ha-jun established that Namgoong would have used the first floor's living room to appreciate the garden, so it was built with a single wide window and only spartan seating options for this function.[29] Some of the interior artwork in the house sets were by South Korea artist Seung-mo Park, including existing artwork of hers and some explicitly created for the film.[29] The team designed the home and interiors to make the set amenable for filming at the 2.35:1 aspect ratio, favouring wide and deeper rooms rather than height.[31]\n\n\nLee said the sun was an important factor when building the outdoor set. \"The sun's direction was a crucial point of consideration while we were searching for outdoor lots\", explained Lee. \"We had to remember the sun's position during our desired time frame and determine the positions and sizes of the windows accordingly. In terms of practical lighting, the DP [Hong Kyung-pyo] had specific requests regarding the colour. He wanted sophisticated indirect lighting and the warmth from tungsten light sources. Before building the set, the DP and I visited the lot several times to check the sun's movement each time, and we decided on the set's location together\".[31]\n\n\n\n#### The Kims' flat[edit]\n\n\nThe Kims' semi-basement flat and its street were also built on set, partially out of necessity for filming the flooding scenes.[31] Lee Ha-jun visited and photographed several abandoned villages and towns in South Korea scheduled to be torn down to help inform the set design. He also created stories for the Kims' neighbours and added details of those residents along the street to improve the authenticity of the street's appearance.[29]\n\n\n\n### Editing[edit]\n\n\nAccording to editor Yang Jin-mo, Bong Joon-ho chose to shoot the film without traditional coverage. To give them more editing options with limited shots, they sometimes stitched together different takes of the same shot.[33] Yang edited the film using Final Cut Pro 7, a program not updated since 2011.[34]\n\n\nThe film was produced for release in colour. A black and white version was produced prior to the world premiere in Cannes and debuted on 26 January 2020 at the International Film Festival Rotterdam, and was re-screened from 29 to 31 January. It also received a limited release in some countries.[35][36]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Parasite (soundtrack)\n\nThe score, by South Korean composer Jung Jae-il, consisted of \"minimalist piano pieces, punctuated with light percussion\", setting the film's \"tense atmosphere\".[37] It also had a baroque texture with excerpts from Handel's opera *Rodelinda* and the 1964 Italian song \"In ginocchio da te\" by Gianni Morandi.[37][38] It was recorded mostly through computer sounds.[39]\n\n\nThe soundtrack was published and released in Korea, in digital and physical formats, by Genie Music and Stone Music Entertainment on 30 May 2019.[40] Internationally, it was released on 11 October 2019 by Milan Records.[41] It was released in English titles,[42] however, the names and nouns are different from the English subtitles as translated by Darcy Paquet.[43] On 14 February 2020, it was released in double-vinyl by Sacred Bones Records (a division of American film production company Neon) and Waxwork Records, in multicolour variants.[44]\n\n\nAn original song, \"Soju han jan\" (Korean: 소주 한 잔, lit. 'A glass of soju'), written by Joon-ho and performed by Choi Woo-shik, who also played the main character Ki-woo, is heard during the film's end credits.[45] For marketing the soundtrack's international digital releases, the song was displayed in English as \"Soju One Glass\" [*sic*]; it was later changed to a grammatically correct title to be shortlisted for the Best Original Song category at the 92nd Academy Awards.[45][46]\n\n\n\n## Themes and interpretations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Economic inequality in South Korea\n\nThe main themes of *Parasite* are class conflict, social inequality and wealth disparity.[47][48][49] Film critics and Bong Joon-ho himself have considered the film as a reflection of late-stage capitalism,[50][51] and some have associated it with the term \"Hell Joseon\" (Korean: 헬조선), a satirical phrase which posits that living in hell would be akin to living in modern South Korea. This term came about due to high rates of youth unemployment, the intense demands of pursuing higher education, the crisis of home affordability, and the increasing socio-economic gap between the wealthy and poor.[52][53][54] In *Coronavirus Capitalism Goes to the Cinema*, Nulman writes that the etymology of the word 'parasite' originally refers to \"person who eats at the table of another\", which is presented in one of the scenes of the film.[49] Nulman also notes the connection between parasites and the Karl Marx quote: \n\n\n> The capitalist… is only capital personified. His soul is the soul of capital. But capital has one sole driving force, the drive to valorize itself, to create surplus-value, to make its constant part, the means of production, absorb the greatest possible amount of surplus labor. Capital is dead labor which, vampire-like, lives only by sucking living labor, and lives the more, the more labor it sucks.[49] \n> \n> \n\nThe film also analyses the use of connections and qualifications to get ahead, for rich and poor families alike.[55] Some argue that the film's discussion of class relates to Pierre Bourdieu's concept of habitus.[49]\n\n\nBong has referred to *Parasite* as an upstairs/downstairs or \"stairway movie\",[18] in which staircases are used as a motif to represent the positions of the families in the homes of the Kims and the Parks, as well as the basement bunker.[56] The semi-basement apartment that the Kims live in is common for poorer Seoul residents due to its lower rent, despite having issues such as mould and increased risk of disease.[47] Monsoon floods such as the one depicted in the film commonly damage these types of residences the most.[55] The film presents class in spatial terms that speak to hierarchy, according to Nulman.[49][57]\n\n\nAccording to Bong, the ending implies that Ki-woo will not be able to earn the funds needed to buy the house, as the final shot shows Ki-woo still in the basement flat and recalls the first scene; he described this shot as a \"surefire kill\" (확인사살), referring to a coup de grace to ensure death.[18] The ending song refers to Ki-woo working to make money to get the house. Choi Woo-shik estimated that it would take approximately 564 years for Ki-woo to earn enough money to purchase the house. Nevertheless, he was optimistic: \"I'm pretty sure Ki-woo is one of those bright kids. He'll come up with some idea, and he would just go into the German family's house, and I think he will rescue his father\".[12] However, according to many interpretations, this dream subscribes to a bootstrapping mentality and is unlikely to be achieved;[18][50][12] furthermore, \"it does not address the fundamental problem at hand. Even in this fantasy scenario, Ki-taek would still be contained in the house by a legal system that would seek his prosecution and imprisonment. The forces that created and upheld the Kim family's separation would not be undone, merely adapted to\".[58]\n\n\nCritics have also considered the themes of colonialism and imperialism. According to Ju-Hyun Park, the film plays out within \"the capitalist economic order inaugurated and upheld in Korea by colonial occupation\", and the use of English language in the film denotes prestige within that economic system.[58] The Park family's son, Da-song, is obsessed with \"Indians\" and owns Native American-themed toys and inauthentic replicas.[59][60][49] Eugene Nulman makes the link between the 'native' Park family and the invaders - the Kims who bring with them deadly parasites for which the natives have no immunity. Nulman points to the miasma theory of scent carrying disease where it was thought that the natives could catch disease just by smelling the noxious air carried by colonising Spaniards. This connects to the film's theme around the class distinction of smell.[49] Bong has noted that: \"I wouldn't go so far as to say it's a commentary on what happened in the United States, but it's related in the sense that this family starts infiltrating the house and they already find a family living there. So you could say it's a joke in that context. But at the same time, the Native Americans have a very complicated and long, deep history. But in this family, that story is reduced to a young boy's hobby and decoration. The boy's mother mentions the tent as a U.S. imported good, and I think it's like the Che Guevara T-shirts that people wear. They don't know the life of the revolutionary figure, they just think it's a cool T-shirt. That's what happens in our current time: The context and meaning behind these actual things only exists as a surface-level thing\".[61]\n\n\nSome critics note the importance of working class solidarity as presented in the film. The problems the Kims find themselves in were a result of a lack of class solidarity with the other poor family, Geun-sae and Moon-gwang. At the climax of the film, Mr Kim becomes aware of his class identity when Mr Park is disgusted with Geun-sae's smell.[49] Others said *Parasite* revealed the misfortunes of poor, powerless victims of an indifferent world who are transformed into liberation through the comical effect of mass slaughter.[62]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Director and stars at an April 2019 press event.\nNeon acquired the US and Canadian rights to the film at the 2018 American Film Market.[63][64] The film's rights were also pre-sold to German-speaking territories (Koch Films), French-speaking territories (The Jokers) and Japan (Bitters End).[65] The film had its world premiere at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival on 21 May.[66] It was released in South Korea on 30 May 2019.[4][26]\n\n\nIt was released in Australia and New Zealand by Madman Films on 27 June 2019[67] (becoming both the highest-ever-grossing Korean film in the region[68] and the distributor's highest-ever-grossing non-English-language film in Australia),[69]. It was screened at the Toronto International Film Festival in Toronto, Canada in September 2019[70] and released generally in the United States and Canada on 11 October 2019.[71] The film was originally scheduled to be screened as a closing film at FIRST International Film Festival Xining in China on 28 July 2019, but on 27 July, the film festival organisers announced that the screening was cancelled for \"technical reasons\".[72]\n\n\nIt was licensed for the United Kingdom and Ireland by Curzon Artificial Eye at Cannes, and had preview screenings in cinemas nationwide with an interview with Bong Joon-ho shared live by satellite on 3 February 2020, followed by the film's general release on 7 February.[73]\n\n\nNeon expanded the number of North American theatres showing the film from 1,060 to 2,001 starting the weekend of 14 February 2020, following the film's recognition at the Academy Awards,[74] despite the film having already been released on home video in the region.[75] A special IMAX remaster was shown at limited North American theatres during the week of 21 February 2020.[76]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\nBy December 2019, the film had earned a net revenue of $90 million from home entertainment, television and foreign sales.[6]\n\n\nOn 28 January 2020, *Parasite* was released on Blu-ray and DVD by Neon, with distribution by Universal Pictures Home Entertainment, and on 2 June it was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray.[77] On 13 February 2020, it was announced that the film will be released on home media by The Criterion Collection.[78][79] On 15 July 2020, The Criterion Collection announced the release date of 27 October 2020, featuring the long-awaited black and white version.[80]\n\n\nOn 24 February 2020, the subscription-based streaming service Hulu announced that it had secured exclusive rights to stream the film in the United States, starting on 8 April 2020.[81] Additionally, Amazon Prime Video began streaming the film outside of the United States on 28 March 2020.[82]\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, it was 2020's best-selling foreign language film on physical home video formats.[83]\n\n\n\n### Black and white edition[edit]\n\n\nA special monochrome version of the film, *Parasite: Black-and-White Edition*, had its world premiere at the International Film Festival Rotterdam in January 2020 and was released in cinemas in some cities in the United States in the same month.[84]\n\n\nIt was released on 24 July 2020 in the United Kingdom and Ireland by Curzon Artificial Eye in cinemas and on-demand simultaneously,[85] and was released on 27 October 2020, in the United States and Canada by The Criterion Collection on DVD and Blu-ray Disc, as part of their special edition rerelease.[86] The black and white transfer of the film was overseen by director Bong Joon-ho and cinematographer Hong Kyung-pyo.[84]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n*Parasite* grossed $71.4 million in South Korea, $53.4 million in the United States and Canada, and $133.9 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $258.7 million.[7][87] It set a new record for Bong, becoming the first of his films to gross over $100 million worldwide.[88] *Deadline Hollywood* calculated the film's net profit as $46.2 million.[6]\n\n\nIn its native South Korea, *Parasite* grossed US$20.7 million on its opening weekend.[87] It would close its box office run with US$72.2 million and more than 10 million admissions, roughly one-fifth of the country's population and ranking first among the year's top five films.[89][90]\n\n\nIn the film's United States opening weekend, it grossed $376,264 from three theatres. Its per-venue average of $125,421 was the best since *La La Land*'s in 2016, and the best ever for an international film.[91] It expanded to 33 theatres in its second weekend, making $1.24 million,[92] and then made $1.8 million from 129 theatres in its third.[93] The film made $2.5 million in its fourth weekend and $2.6 million in its fifth.[94] The film's initial theatre count peaked in its sixth weekend at 620, when it made $1.9 million.[95] It continued to hold well over the following weekends, making $1.3 million and $1 million.[96][97]\n\n\nIn its tenth week of release the film crossed the $20 million mark (rare for an international film), making $632,500 from 306 theatres.[98] During the weekend of the Oscars, the film made $1.5 million from 1,060 theatres for a running total of $35.5 million.[99] After Neon's doubling of theatre showings in the week following the Academy Awards, the film made $5.5 million in revenue from the United States and Canada, making it one of the biggest Best Picture bumps since *Slumdog Millionaire* in 2009 and the biggest in ten years.[100]\n\n\nOn 5 February, *Parasite* became the first Korean film in nearly 15 years that surpassed one million moviegoers in Japan.[101] In the UK, it broke the record for the opening weekend of a non-English-language film, making £1.4 million ($1.8 million) including previews over its debut weekend, from 135 screens,[102] and in Australia it took in over $1.9 million.[103] In the weekend following its Oscars wins, the film made $12.8 million from 43 countries, bringing its international total to $161 million, and its global running gross over the $200 million mark.[104]\n\n\nFollowing its Academy Awards success, *Parasite* received significant rescreening, generating significant further revenue. The Associated Press reported the biggest \"Oscar effect\" since 2001 after *Gladiator* won the Oscar for Best Picture. *Parasite*'s box office revenue increased by more than 230% compared to the prior week, grossing $2.15 million in a single day. It also ranked No. 1 in Japan, the first Korean film to do so in 15 years.[105] The Motion Picture Distributors Association of Australia announced that $749K worth of cinema tickets were sold in a single weekend, with the film re-entering the top 10 at the local box office more than six months after it debuted in Australian cinemas. *Parasite* also surged back to fourth place in South Korea's box office by attracting more than 80,000 viewers.[106][107]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, *Parasite* has an approval rating of 99% based on 483 reviews, with an average rating of 9.4/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \"An urgent, brilliantly layered look at timely social themes, *Parasite* finds writer-director Bong Joon Ho in near-total command of his craft.\"[108] On Metacritic, 52 compiled reviews from critics were identified as positive, giving the film a weighted average score of 96 out of 100, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[109] On the same site, *Parasite* was rated as the best film of 2019[110][111] and was ranked 7th among the films with the highest scores of the decade.[112] As of 20 November 2021, it is the 48th highest-rated film of all time on the website.[113]\n\n\nWriting for *The New York Times*, A. O. Scott described the film as \"wildly entertaining, the kind of smart, generous, aesthetically energized movie that obliterates the tired distinctions between art films and popcorn movies\".[114] Bilge Ebiri of *Vulture* magazine wrote that *Parasite* is \"a work that is itself in a state of constant, agitated transformation—a nerve-racking masterpiece whose spell lingers long after its haunting final image\".[115] In his five-star review, Dave Calhoun of *Time Out* praised the social commentary in the film, calling the overall work \"surprising and fully gripping from beginning to end, full of big bangs and small wonders\".[116] *Variety*'s Jessica Kiang described the film as \"a wild, wild ride\", writing that \"Bong is back and on brilliant form, but he is unmistakably, roaringly furious, and it registers because the target is so deserving, so enormous, so 2019: *Parasite* is a tick fat with the bitter blood of class rage\".[117] Joshua Rivera from *GQ* gave a glowing review and declared *Parasite* to possibly be one of the best films from 2019.[118]\n\n\nMichael Wood writing for the *London Review of Books* found its following a theme of class consciousness to be consistent with the director's previous *Snowpiercer* stating, \"The theme of social ascent, or social difference as a landscape, could hardly be more obvious, but we are beginning to get the movie's idea: not to avoid stereotypes but to keep crashing into them\".[119] UK film website TheShiznit awarded an A, noting \"it makes you wonder what the inflection point for such behaviour is in a culture where manners and servitude are drilled into those who can't afford not to have them\".[120] *The A.V. Club*'s A. A. Dowd awarded the film an A− grade, praising the fun and surprising twists.[121]\n\n\n*Parasite* ranked first in a survey by IndieWire of over 300 critics, in the Best Film, Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Foreign Film categories.[122] It also appeared on over 240 critics' year-end top-ten lists, including 77 who ranked it first.[110]\n\n\n\n## Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by *Parasite*\n\n![](image)Bong Joon-ho was awarded the Academy Award for Best Director in 2020.\n*Parasite* won the Palme d'Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival. It became the first South Korean film to do so, as well as the first film to win with a unanimous vote since *Blue Is the Warmest Colour* at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival.[123][124] At the 77th Golden Globe Awards, the film was nominated for three awards, including Best Director and Best Screenplay, and won Best Foreign Language Film, becoming the first South Korean film to achieve that feat.[125][126]\n\n\nIt became the second international film to ever be nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture since *Life Is Beautiful* (1997), and ultimately won the category, making it the first international film to win the prize.[127][128] *Parasite* was also nominated for four awards at the 73rd British Academy Film Awards—Best Film, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Film Not in the English Language, being the first South Korean film to receive nominations other than for Best Film Not in the English Language, and went on to win Best Original Screenplay and Best Film Not in the English Language.[129][130]\n\n\n*Parasite* was submitted as the South Korean entry for Best International Feature Film for the 92nd Academy Awards, making the December shortlist.[131][132][133] It went on to win four awards—Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best International Feature Film. *Parasite* became the first non-English language film in Academy Awards history to win Best Picture. *Parasite* also became the first South Korean film to be nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards and the second East Asian film to receive a nomination for Best Picture since *Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon* (2000),[134] and Bong Joon-ho became the fourth Asian to receive an Academy Award nomination for Best Director, becoming the second to win, after Ang Lee. It also received nominations for Best Film Editing and Best Production Design.[135][136][137] The film is also the second film to win both the Academy Award for Best Picture and the Palme d'Or at Cannes under the latter's name in sixty-five years since *Marty*,[138] being the third film to win both grand prizes after the former and *The Lost Weekend*.[139]\n\n\nAt the 56th Grand Bell Awards, Parasite earned a leading 11 nominations, with five wins (the most for the show): Best Film, Best Director (for Bong Joon-ho), Best Supporting Actress (for Lee Jung-eun), Best Screenplay (for Bong Joon Ho and Han Jin-Won), and Best Music (for Jung Jae-il).[140]\n\n\n\n> \n> \"When I was young and studying cinema, there was a saying that I carved deep into my heart, which is that, 'The most personal is the most creative.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n– Bong Joon-ho in an acceptance speech for winning Best Director at the 92nd Academy Awards, as he attributed to Martin Scorsese.[141]\n\nDuring Bong Joon-ho's acceptance speech at the Oscars, he paused to thank Martin Scorsese, a co-nominated director, whom Bong recognised as having historical importance to the history of filmmaking, which resulted in spontaneous applause from the audience. The following day, Scorsese sent the director a personal congratulatory letter, which Bong reported while on a speaking engagement at the Film at Lincoln Center, though Bong stated that he could not share the full letter due to its personal nature. He did, however, share the conclusion of the letter by stating that Scorsese told him that \"You've done well. Now rest. But don't rest for too long.\" Bong then added that Scorsese ended his letter by stating \"how he and other directors were waiting for my (Bong's) next movie\".[142]\n\n\nThe Associated Press commented that although the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) had previously failed to adequately recognise women filmmakers in the Academy Award nominations, this time it acknowledged diversity. *The Wall Street Journal* also stated that the film seemed to promise a \"more inclusive Oscars\" demanded by those who have previously criticised AMPAS.[143] The AP noted that the film's victory, because of its being an Oscar-winning foreign film in a regular Academy category, opens the door for Hollywood to undergo a radical change and a different kind of advancement, as a sceptic worried that if \"Parasite won the Oscar for best international film, it probably wouldn't win any other major awards\".[144] \"The academy gave best picture to the actual best picture\", wrote Justin Chang of the *Los Angeles Times*, who continued that the film awards body was \"startled ... into recognizing that no country's cinema has a monopoly on greatness\".[145] In 2021, the Writers Guild of America ranked *Parasite's* screenplay the fourth greatest of the 21st century so far.[146]\n\n\nOn 28 March 2023, Cannes Film Festival president Thierry Frémaux revealed that after *Everything Everywhere All at Once*, a 2022 science fiction comedy-drama also featuring a predominantly Asian cast, won the Best Picture Oscar at the 95th Academy Awards, he began to question whether the Best Picture win for *Parasite* was worthy enough, saying \"How can a non-American film win the Oscar for best film since it's a ceremony in honor of American cinema? *Parasite* won, it's great, but it's a Korean film.\"[147]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n### Spin-off television series[edit]\n\n\nA six-hour HBO limited series based on the film, with Bong and Adam McKay as executive producers, was announced to be in early development in January 2020.[148] Bong has stated that this will also be entitled *Parasite*, and will explore stories \"that happen in between the sequences in the film\".[149][13] In February 2020, Mark Ruffalo was rumoured to star whilst Tilda Swinton was confirmed as being cast in a lead role.[150][151][152] However, in October 2022, Tilda Swinton announced she was no longer involved with the series.[153]\n\n\n\n### Plans for tourist set[edit]\n\n\nA South Korean local government (Goyang City) plans to restore the Goyang Aqua Special Shooting Studio set, where the film *Parasite* was produced, and use it as a *Parasite* movie experience tourism facility. In addition, Goyang City has announced that it will invest $150 million in the development of the Goyang Film Culture Complex by 2026 to accommodate film experience tourism facilities, additional indoor studios, outdoor set production facilities, inter-Korean video content centres, image research and development companies.[154][155][156] However, criticisms have been made about the commercialisation of areas known for poverty in South Korea as tourist destinations without concrete steps being taken to address the issues at hand.[157][158]\n\n\n\n### City tourism and food[edit]\n\n\nThe Seoul Tourism Organization (STO) has been criticised by South Korea's opposition party and residents of Seoul for introducing a tour route featuring filming locations and stories from the film. The Justice Party claims that it became famous due to the universal recognition of global inequality.[159] However, it sees the development of a tourist attraction based on the film in Seoul as amounting to the further exploitation of poverty.[160] Residents living in *Parasite*'s filming locations have reportedly complained of a sense of embarrassment and discomfort due to an increase in tourists visiting their neighbourhoods and taking photos of their surroundings, making them feel like \"monkeys in a zoo\".[161] In response, the local government of Seoul has announced that government funding will prioritise the estimated 1,500 low-income families living in the semi-basement type accommodations featured in the film.[162]\n\n\nPeople began posting videos on how to make jjapaguri (called \"ram-don\" in the film's English subtitles) on YouTube after the film was distributed.[22] Nongshim, the manufacturer of Chapagetti and Neoguri, also began distributing a singular \"Chapaguri\" product due to the combination's popularity from the film.[163]\n\n\n\n## Bibliography[edit]\n\n\n* Botz-Bornstein, Thorsten; Stamatellos, Giannis (2022). *Parasite: A Philosophical Exploration*.

The French-produced film was largely silent with French intertitles and contained a few spoken lines in English.[8] The Academy dictates foreign language as the main qualification for international film, hence *The Artist* did not qualify.[9] Further, while prior winners *The Last Emperor* and *Slumdog Millionaire* include significant amounts of non-English dialogue, they were considered domestic productions.[8]\n2. **^** The previous two films to win both awards were *The Lost Weekend* (1945) and *Marty* (1955).\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"*Parasite* international press kit\" (PDF).

It stars Sally Hawkins, Michael Shannon, Richard Jenkins, Doug Jones, Michael Stuhlbarg, and Octavia Spencer. Set in 1962 Baltimore, Maryland, the film follows a mute custodian at a high-security government laboratory who falls in love with a captured humanoid amphibian creature, and decides to help him escape from death at the hands of an evil colonel. Filming took place on location in Ontario, Canada, from August to November 2016.\n\n\n*The Shape of Water* was screened as part of the main competition in the 74th Venice International Film Festival, where it premiered on August 31, 2017, and was awarded the Golden Lion. It was also screened at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival. It began a limited release in two theaters in New York City on December 1, 2017, before expanding wide on December 22, 2017, and grossed $195 million worldwide.\n\n\n*The Shape of Water* was acclaimed by critics, who lauded its acting, screenplay, direction, visuals, production design, cinematography, and musical score. The American Film Institute selected it as one of the top ten films of 2017. The film was nominated for a leading thirteen awards at the 90th Academy Awards, winning four, including Best Picture and Best Director for del Toro, and received numerous other accolades. It was the second fantasy film to win Best Picture, after *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* (2003). A novelization by del Toro and Daniel Kraus was published on March 6, 2018.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nElisa Esposito, who was found abandoned by the side of a river as an infant with scars on her neck, is mute and communicates through sign language. In 1962, during the Cold War, Elisa works as a custodian at a secret government laboratory in Baltimore, Maryland, and lives a very routine life in an apartment above a movie theater. Her only friends are her closeted gay next-door neighbor Giles, a struggling middle-aged advertising illustrator, and her co-worker Zelda Fuller. \n\n\nColonel Richard Strickland has just captured a mysterious creature from a South American river and has taken it to the Baltimore facility for further study. Curious, Elisa discovers it is a humanoid amphibian. She begins visiting him in secret, and they form a close bond. \n\n\nSeeking to exploit the Amphibian Man for a US advantage in the Space Race, General Frank Hoyt is eventually persuaded by Strickland to vivisect it. Dr. Robert Hoffstetler, a scientist who is secretly a Russian spy named Dimitri Mosenkov, pleads unsuccessfully to Strickland to keep him alive for further study, while simultaneously ordered by his Soviet handlers to kill the creature. \n\n\nWhen Elisa overhears the Americans' plans for the Amphibian Man, she attempts to persuade Giles to help her liberate him. He refuses at first, scared of the consequences and ethics. After failing to get his job back, Giles is rejected by a pie restaurant worker, who he discovers is a racist and homophobe. Subsequently, he has a change of heart. \n\n\nHoffstetler stumbles upon Elisa's plot in progress and chooses to assist her. Though initially reluctant, Zelda also becomes involved in making the escape successful. Elisa plans to release the Amphibian Man into a nearby canal when heavy rain will allow access to the ocean. In the meantime, she keeps him in her bathtub. Strickland interrogates Elisa and Zelda, among others, but he learns nothing. \n\n\nThe Amphibian Man encounters one of Giles's cats, who reacts expectedly. Giles discovers the Amphibian Man devouring the cat. When he tries to stop him, he gets startled, slashes Giles's arm and rushes out of the apartment. He gets as far as the cinema downstairs before Elisa finds him and returns him to her apartment. \n\n\nThe creature touches Giles on his balding head and wounded arm. The next morning, Giles discovers hair has begun growing back on his previously bald head, while the wounds on his arm have healed. Elisa continues to develop her romantic relationship with the Amphibian Man, culminating in sexual intercourse.\n\n\nGeneral Hoyt unexpectedly arrives and tells Strickland he has 36 hours to recover the Amphibian Man, or his career and life will be over. Meanwhile, Hoffstetler is told by his handlers that he will be extracted from the US in two days. Although the planned release date approaches, the Amphibian Man's health begins to deteriorate. \n\n\nHoffstetler goes to meet his handlers, and Strickland follows him. At the rendezvous, Hoffstetler is shot by one of them and Strickland intervenes, shooting both handlers. Realizing that Hoffstetler is a spy, Strickland tortures the dying man into revealing the Amphibian Man's whereabouts. He is surprised to learn that Elisa and Zelda are involved. \n\n\nStrickland threatens Zelda in her home unsuccessfully, until her husband Brewster, reveals that Elisa has the Amphibian Man. She immediately telephones her, warning her to release the creature. An enraged Strickland ransacks Elisa's empty apartment until he finds evidence in the bathtub and a calendar note revealing where she plans to release the Amphibian Man.\n\n\nAt the canal, Elisa and Giles are bidding farewell to the creature when Strickland arrives, knocks Giles down, and shoots both the Amphibian Man and Elisa. The Amphibian Man heals himself, and kills Strickland by slashing his throat. As the police arrive on the scene with Zelda, the Amphibian Man takes Elisa and jumps into the canal, swimming around her lifeless body. He applies his healing powers/ability to the scars on Elisa's neck, which open to reveal gills like his.\n\n\nElisa jolts back to life and they embrace and kiss. In a closing voice-over narration, Giles conveys his belief that Elisa lived happily ever after and remained in love with the Amphibian Man.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n* Sally Hawkins as Elisa Esposito\n* Michael Shannon as Richard Strickland\n* Richard Jenkins as Giles\n* Doug Jones as \"The Amphibian Man\"\n* Michael Stuhlbarg as Robert Hoffstetler / Dimitri Mosenkov\n* Octavia Spencer as Zelda Delilah Fuller\n* Nick Searcy as General of the Air Force Frank Hoyt\n* David Hewlett as Fleming\n* Nigel Bennett as Mihalkov\n* Stewart Arnott as Bernard\n* Lauren Lee Smith as Elaine Strickland\n* Martin Roach as Brewster Fuller\n* John Kapelos as Mr. Arzoumanian\n* Morgan Kelly as Pie Guy\n* Wendy Lyon as Sally\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Gill-man from *Creature from the Black Lagoon* was the inspiration for del Toro's concept.\nIt was co-produced between the United States and Mexico. The film was directed by Guillermo del Toro from a screenplay he co-wrote with Vanessa Taylor.[1] Del Toro formed the idea for *The Shape of Water* over breakfast in December 2011 with Daniel Kraus, his future collaborator on the novel *Trollhunters*.[6] It was primarily inspired by del Toro's childhood memories of seeing *Creature from the Black Lagoon* (1954) and wanting to see the Gill-man and Kay Lawrence (played by Julie Adams) succeed in their romance.[7]\n\n\nWhen del Toro was in talks with Universal to direct a remake of *Creature from the Black Lagoon*, he tried pitching a version focused more on the creature's perspective, where the Creature ended up together with the female lead, but the studio executives rejected the concept.[8] Additionally, the film also shows similarities to the 2015 short film *The Space Between Us*.[9]\n\n\nIn placing the film in the 1960s, del Toro said \"the movie is a movie about our problems today and about demonizing the other and about fearing or hating the other, and how that is a much more destructive position than learning to love and understand [...] if I say once upon a time in 1962, it becomes a fairy tale for troubled times. People can lower their guard a little bit more and listen to the story and listen to the characters and talk about the issues, rather than the circumstances of the issues.\"[10]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\nA fan of her performances in *Fingersmith* (2005) and *Happy-Go-Lucky* (2008), del Toro wrote the script with Sally Hawkins in mind for the female lead and pitched the idea to her while he was intoxicated at the 2014 Golden Globes.[11] Hawkins prepared for the role by watching films of silent comedians Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, and Stan Laurel from Laurel and Hardy, the last of whom Del Toro told her to watch because he thought Laurel could \"do a state of grace without conveying it verbally\".[12]\n\n\nDoug Jones was chosen to portray the Amphibian Man in *The Shape of Water*, having collaborated with del Toro on *Mimic* (1997), *Hellboy* (2004), *Pan's Labyrinth* (2006), *Hellboy II: The Golden Army* (2008), and *Crimson Peak* (2015). In an interview with NPR, Jones said his initial reaction to learning the creature would also be a romantic lead was \"utter terror\" but trusted the director to expand the character's development. As Jones wanted to portray a creature distinct from others in monster films, he practiced a variety of movements in a dance studio. After del Toro told him to make the character \"animalistic, but royal and regal\", Jones decided to also portray the character as a Matador.[13]\n\n\nThe part of Giles was originally written with Ian McKellen in mind, and del Toro was inspired to do so by his performance in *Gods and Monsters* as the real-life closeted gay filmmaker James Whale, the director of *Frankenstein* (1931), *The Invisible Man* (1933), and *Bride of Frankenstein* (1935), who found himself unemployable in his later years. When McKellen proved unavailable, del Toro sent an e-mail to Richard Jenkins, who accepted the part.[14]\n\n\nMichael Shannon was cast as Richard Strickland, the villain of the film. Shannon and del Toro had early conversations about the notion that Strickland would have been the hero of the film if it had been made in the 1950s, something that fascinated the actor.[15] Octavia Spencer, who played the role of Elisa's co-worker, friend, and interpreter Zelda, found it funny that the people del Toro used to speak for the mute main character were people who represent very disenfranchised groups.[16]\n\n\n\n### Filming and visuals[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Elgin Theatre, Toronto, the Orpheum cinema of the film\nPrincipal photography began on August 15, 2016, in Toronto and Hamilton, Ontario,[17][18][19] and wrapped on November 6, 2016.[20] The interior of the Orpheum (the movie theater seen in the film), is that of the Elgin and Winter Garden Theatres in Toronto, while the exterior of the building is the façade of the Victorian Massey Hall, a performing arts theatre not far from the other one. Elisa and Giles's old flats, which in the film are just above the Orpheum, were actually a set built at Cinespace Studios, West Toronto.[21]\n\n\nDel Toro was torn between making the film in color or in black and white, and was at one point leaning toward the latter. Fox Searchlight Pictures offered del Toro either a $20 million budget to make the film in color or a $17 million budget to shoot it in black and white. Del Toro admitted he was in \"a battle I was expecting to lose. I was of two minds. On one hand I thought black and white would look luscious, but on the other hand I thought it would look postmodern, like I was being reflective rather than immersed.\" As a result, he chose to shoot it in color.[22][23] In an interview with *IndieWire* about the film, del Toro said the project was a \"healing movie for me\", as it allowed him to explore and \"speak about trust, otherness, sex, love, where we're going. These are not concerns that I had when I was nine or seven.\"[24]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *The Shape of Water* (soundtrack)\n\nThree years before *The Shape of Water* was released, del Toro met with composer Alexandre Desplat to talk about the film's premise. In January 2017, Desplat was shown a rough cut of the finished film, and finding it similar to a musical, he agreed to compose a score. As a result, Desplat tried to capture the sound of water extensively to have audiences experience a \"warm feeling\" that is also caused by love. In an interview, he said the melody from the opening scene was \"actually made of waves. I did not do that on purpose, but by being completely immersed in this love and these water elements, I wrote a melody that plays arpeggios like waves.\"[25]\n\n\nWriting the film score took six weeks; it was purposely composed to create the sense of immersion and to give the \"sense that you, yourself, are floating\". The two melodies, one titled \"Elisa's Theme\", are heard at the beginning of the film and later merge into a single piece of music by the end of it. To emphasize this effect and its final result, Desplat changed the sounds of the accompanying flutes, accordions, and whistles to \"something blurred\". On composing the score overall, he said that it was \"a matter of sculpting the music and making it take the shape of the storyline.\" As a result, Desplat opted out of giving Shannon's character a melody.[25]\n\n\nThe music for *The Shape of Water* was released on December 1, 2017, by Decca Records. At the 90th Academy Awards, it received the Academy Award for Best Original Score.[26] Desplat noted that \"when the movie's that beautiful—and I actually think this movie is a masterpiece—it makes your life much easier. You just have to put your hands on it and it takes you anywhere you want.\"[25]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n*The Shape of Water* premiered on August 31, 2017, at the 74th Venice International Film Festival, where it was awarded the Golden Lion for best film.[27][28] It also screened at Telluride Film Festival,[29] the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival,[30] and BFI London Film Festival, among others.[31] The film was released in two theaters in New York City on December 1, 2017, and then expanded to several other cities the following week. It had its official wide release in the United States on December 8, 2017.[32]\n\n\nOn March 13, 2018, the film was released on Blu-ray, DVD, and digital download.[33] Special features on the Ultra HD Blu-ray includes a making-of documentary, two featurettes, a MasterClass Q & A with Guillermo del Toro, an interview with artist James Jean, and three theatrical trailers.[34]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n*The Shape of Water* grossed $63.9 million in the United States and Canada, and $131.4 million in other countries, for a total of $195.2 million.[5]\n\n\nAfter grossing $4.6 million over a three-week limited release, the film began its wide release on December 22, 2017, alongside the openings of *Downsizing*, *Pitch Perfect 3* and *Father Figures*, and the wide expansion of *Darkest Hour*, and grossed $3 million from 726 theaters over the weekend, and $4.4 million over the four-day Christmas frame.[35] The following weekend, the film made $3.5 million.[36] The weekend of January 27, 2018, following the announcement of the film's 13 Oscar nominations, the film was added to over 1,000 theaters (for a total of 1,854) and made $5.9 million (an increase of 171% over the previous week's $2.2 million), finishing 8th.[37] The weekend of March 9–11, following its four Oscar wins, the film made an additional $2.4 million. It marked a 64% increase from the previous week's $1.5 million and was similar to the $2.5 million made by the previous year's Best Picture winner, *Moonlight*.[38]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nSally Hawkins, Octavia Spencer, and Richard Jenkins's performances garnered Academy Award nominations for Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress, and Best Supporting Actor respectively.\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 92% based on 465 reviews, with an average rating of 8.3/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"*The Shape of Water* finds Guillermo del Toro at his visually distinctive best—and matched by an emotionally absorbing story brought to life by a stellar Sally Hawkins performance.\"[39] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 87 out of 100, based on 53 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[40] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave it positive reviews; audience members under the age of 40 gave the film an average grade of either \"A+\" or \"A\", while those over 40 gave it an \"A\" to \"A−\", on an A+ to F scale;[41] PostTrak reported that filmgoers gave the film an overall positive score of 80%.[42]\n\n\nBen Croll of *IndieWire* gave the film an 'A' rating and called it \"one of del Toro's most stunningly successful works... also a powerful vision of a creative master feeling totally, joyously free.\"[43] Writing for *Rolling Stone*, Peter Travers gave the film three and a half out of four stars, praising Hawkins's performance, the cinematography and del Toro's direction, and saying: \"Even as the film plunges into torment and tragedy, the core relationship between these two unlikely lovers holds us in thrall. Del Toro is a world-class film artist. There's no sense trying to analyze how he does it.\"[44] For the *Minnesota Daily*, Haley Bennett reacted positively, writing, \"*The Shape of Water* has tenderness uncommon to del Toro films. ... While *The Shape of Water* isn't groundbreaking, it is elegant and mesmerizing.\"[10]\n\n\nRex Reed of the *New York Observer* gave the film one out of four stars, calling it \"a loopy, lunkheaded load of drivel\" and that \"the whole movie is off the wall\". Reed's review was criticized for referring to Hawkins's mute character as \"mentally handicapped\" and for falsely crediting actor Benicio del Toro (spelled Benecio) as the film's director. Reed also stated Benicio was Spanish, whereas he is Puerto Rican; Guillermo del Toro hails from Mexico.[45]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of accolades received by *The Shape of Water*\n\n*The Shape of Water* received 13 nominations at the 90th Academy Awards, the most of any film in the 2018 race. It won in four categories: Best Production Design, Best Original Score, Best Director, and Best Picture. It was the second fantasy film to win Best Picture, after *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* (2003).[46][47][48] *The Shape of Water* was acclaimed by critics, who lauded its acting, screenplay, direction, visuals, production design, and musical score. The American Film Institute selected it as one of the top 10 films of the year.[49] At the 75th Golden Globe Awards, the film earned seven nominations, winning for Best Director and Best Original Score.[50] It received twelve nominations at the 71st British Academy Film Awards, winning three awards including Best Director, and fourteen at the 23rd Critics' Choice Awards, winning four awards.[51]\n\n\nThe film also sparked some debate about whether it should have been eligible for a Canadian Screen Awards nomination, as it was filmed in Canada with a predominantly Canadian crew and many Canadian actors in supporting roles. Under Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television rules, to qualify for CSA nominations under the rules for international coproductions, at least 15 percent of a film's funding must come from a Canadian film studio. Even the film's Canadian co-producer, J. Miles Dale, stated that he supports the rules and does not believe the film should have been eligible.[52] *The Shape of Water* also appeared on many critics' year-end top-ten lists, of which 25 critics chose it as their favorite film of that year.[53] A novelization by del Toro and Kraus was published on March 6, 2018.[54]\n\n\n\n## Plagiarism accusations[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2018, the estate of Paul Zindel initiated a lawsuit in United States District Court for the Central District of California against director Guillermo del Toro and associate producer Daniel Kraus, alleging that *The Shape of Water* \"brazenly copies the story, elements, characters, and themes\" of Zindel's 1969 work *Let Me Hear You Whisper*, which depicts a cleaning lady bonding with a dolphin and attempting to rescue it from a secret research laboratory's nefarious uses.[55] The complaint spends more than a dozen pages detailing alleged \"overwhelming similarities\" between the works.[56] Del Toro denied the claim of the Zindel estate, saying that \"I have never read nor seen the play. I'd never heard of this play before making *The Shape of Water*, and none of my collaborators ever mentioned the play.\" Distributor Fox Searchlight also denied the claim and said that it would \"vigorously defend\" itself in court.[57]\n\n\nIn July 2018, Judge Percy Anderson dismissed the suit and stated that del Toro and Fox Searchlight were entitled to recover their legal costs.[58] On April 5, 2021, the following statement by plaintiff was released: \"David Zindel, the son of Paul Zindel, author of *Let Me Hear You Whisper*, acknowledges, based on confidential information obtained during the litigation process, that his claims of plagiarism are unfounded. He acknowledges Guillermo del Toro as the true creator of *The Shape of Water*. Any similarity between the two works is coincidental.\"[59]\n\n\nThere have also been accusations that *The Shape of Water* plagiarised *Amphibian Man*, a 1962 Soviet film based on a 1928 novel of the same name by Alexander Belyaev.[60][61] *Indie Cinema Magazine* noted that both have a similar plot, the use of the name \"Amphibian Man\" in both films, the Soviet connection in both stories, and the 1962 setting.[60] *Amphibian Man* was one of the highest-grossing Soviet films of all time, with up to 100 million box office admissions in the Soviet Union.[62]\n\n\nThe film also received accusations of plagiarism by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, the French director of the romantic comedy *Amélie* and the cult classic *Delicatessen*,[63] who claimed that del Toro plagiarized some of the scenes within his works *Amelie*, *Delicatessen*, and *The City of Lost Children*.[64] Other observers vehemently disagree with Jeunet's assertion.[65] Jeunet pointed out some of the similarities in the saturation of the colours, overall art direction and the use of anthropomorphic objects, as well as the music, which is reminiscent of Yann Tiersen's soundtrack on the former. Responding to Jeunet's accusations of plagiarism, del Toro cited the influences of Terry Gilliam's works as the inspiration for *The Shape of Water*.[64] Both composer Alexandre Desplat and del Toro have cited French composer Georges Delerue,[66] whose work predates Tiersen's by decades, as the inspiration for the musical score. Desplat has also emphasized the importance of water as essential to both the score and to the themes of the film itself.[67]\n\n\nWhile covering the plagiarism accusations from Jeunet and Zindel, comparisons were also drawn between *The Shape of Water* and the 2015 short film \"The Space Between Us\", the latter of which was created as a student project at the Netherlands Film Academy.[68][69] Outlets reported that both films held a similar premise, that of a janitorial worker falling in love with an amphibious man held captive at a research facility, as well as other similarities such as the time period as well as \"scenes in which the woman feeds the creature and dances to records in front of it; and rescue missions, both involving laundry carts, devised after plans to kill and dissect the creatures come to light.\"[70][71] After screening a copy of *The Shape of Water*, the Netherlands Film Academy and students issued a statement acknowledging the films as uniquely different and that \"They have separate timelines of development and are not in any conceivable way interlinked or related.\"[72]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"The Shape of Water\".

It is given in honor of a film director who has exhibited outstanding directing while working in the film industry.\nThe award is traditionally presented by the previous year's Best Director winner.\n\n\nThe 1st Academy Awards ceremony was held in 1929 with the award being split into \"Dramatic\" and \"Comedy\" categories; Frank Borzage and Lewis Milestone won for *7th Heaven* and *Two Arabian Knights*, respectively.[1] However, these categories were merged for all subsequent ceremonies.[2] Nominees are determined by single transferable vote within the directors branch of AMPAS; winners are selected by a plurality vote from the entire eligible voting members of the academy.[3][4][5]\n\n\nFor the first eleven years of the Academy Awards, directors were allowed to be nominated for multiple films in the same year. However, after the nomination of Michael Curtiz for two films, *Angels with Dirty Faces* and *Four Daughters*, at the 11th Academy Awards, the rules were revised so that an individual could only be nominated for one film at each ceremony.[6] That rule has since been amended, although the only director who has received multiple nominations in the same year was Steven Soderbergh for *Erin Brockovich* and *Traffic* in 2000, winning the award for the latter. The Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture have been very closely linked throughout their history. Of the 89 films that won Best Picture and were also nominated for Best Director, 68 won the award.[7][8]\n\n\nSince its inception, the award has been given to 74 directors or directing teams. As of the 2023 ceremony, American filmmaking duo Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert are the most recent winner in this category for their work on *Everything Everywhere All at Once* and the third duo to win after Robert Wise & Jerome Robbins (*West Side Story*) and the Coen brothers (*No Country for Old Men*).\n\n\n\n\n## Winners and nominees[edit]\n\n\nIn the following table, the years are listed as per Academy convention, and generally correspond to the year of film release in Los Angeles County, California; the ceremonies are always held the following year.[9] For the first five ceremonies, the eligibility period spanned twelve months from August 1 to July 31.[10] For the 6th ceremony held in 1934, the eligibility period lasted from August 1, 1932, to December 31, 1933.[10] Since the 7th ceremony held in 1935, the period of eligibility became the full previous calendar year from January 1 to December 31.[10]\n\n\n\n![](image)Frank Borzage won twice: \"Dramatic director\" at the first ceremony, for *7th Heaven* (1927); & later, *Bad Girl* (1931).\n![](image)Lewis Milestone won twice: \"Comedy director\" at the first ceremony, for *Two Arabian Knights* (1927); & later, *All Quiet on the Western Front* (1930).\n![](image)Frank Lloyd won twice, for *The Divine Lady* (1929) & *Cavalcade* (1933).\n![](image)Frank Capra won thrice, for *It Happened One Night* (1934), *Mr. Deeds Goes to Town* (1936), & *You Can't Take It with You* (1938).\n![](image)John Ford won a record four times, for: *The Informer* (1935), *The Grapes of Wrath* (1940), *How Green Was My Valley* (1941), & *The Quiet Man* (1952).\n![](image)Leo McCarey won twice, for *The Awful Truth* (1937) & *Going My Way* (1944).\n![](image)Victor Fleming won for *Gone with the Wind* (1939).\n![](image)William Wyler, with a record twelve nominations, won thrice, for: *Mrs. Miniver* (1942), *The Best Years of Our Lives* (1946), & *Ben-Hur* (1959).\n![](image)Michael Curtiz won for *Casablanca* (1942).\n![](image)Billy Wilder (*right*, with Gloria Swanson) won twice, for *The Lost Weekend* (1945) & *The Apartment* (1960).\n![](image)Elia Kazan won twice, for *Gentleman's Agreement* (1947) & *On the Waterfront* (1954).\n![](image)John Huston won for *The Treasure of the Sierra Madre* (1948).\n![](image)Joseph L.

However, the Academy subsequently decided to remove Chaplin's name from the competitive award categories and instead to confer upon him a Special Award \"for acting, writing, directing and producing *The Circus*\". Chilton, Martin (May 16, 2016). \"The first Oscars: what happened in 1929\". *The Daily Telegraph*. Archived from the original on May 19, 2016. Retrieved February 25, 2021.\n2. **^** The 2nd Academy Awards is unique in being the only occasion where there were no official nominees. Subsequent research by AMPAS has resulted in a list of unofficial or *de facto* nominees, based on records of which films were evaluated by the judges.\n3. **^** Michael Curtiz was not on the original ballot of nominees. However, after the year prior with Bette Davis's omission for *Of Human Bondage*, the resulting furor led to a write-in campaign determined to secure her a nomination. Thus, the Academy relaxed their rules and allowed her performance to be amongst the competition. They permitted this once more, prompting further submissions: Curtiz; Paul Muni for *Black Fury*; and several other categories, including Hal Mohr for *A Midsummer Night's Dream*. Ultimately, Mohr became the only person to win an Oscar as a result of this process. The Academy discontinued this option from the next ceremony forward to prevent any recurrence.\n4. **^** The eligibility period for the 93rd ceremony was extended through to February 28, 2021, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* BAFTA Award for Best Direction\n* Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Director\n* Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing – Feature Film\n* Golden Globe Award for Best Director\n* Independent Spirit Award for Best Director\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Dirks, Tim. \"1927–28 Academy Awards Winners\".

It is given in honor of a film director who has exhibited outstanding directing while working in the film industry.\nThe award is traditionally presented by the previous year's Best Director winner.\n\n\nThe 1st Academy Awards ceremony was held in 1929 with the award being split into \"Dramatic\" and \"Comedy\" categories; Frank Borzage and Lewis Milestone won for *7th Heaven* and *Two Arabian Knights*, respectively.[1] However, these categories were merged for all subsequent ceremonies.[2] Nominees are determined by single transferable vote within the directors branch of AMPAS; winners are selected by a plurality vote from the entire eligible voting members of the academy.[3][4][5]\n\n\nFor the first eleven years of the Academy Awards, directors were allowed to be nominated for multiple films in the same year. However, after the nomination of Michael Curtiz for two films, *Angels with Dirty Faces* and *Four Daughters*, at the 11th Academy Awards, the rules were revised so that an individual could only be nominated for one film at each ceremony.[6] That rule has since been amended, although the only director who has received multiple nominations in the same year was Steven Soderbergh for *Erin Brockovich* and *Traffic* in 2000, winning the award for the latter. The Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture have been very closely linked throughout their history. Of the 89 films that won Best Picture and were also nominated for Best Director, 68 won the award.[7][8]\n\n\nSince its inception, the award has been given to 74 directors or directing teams. As of the 2023 ceremony, American filmmaking duo Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert are the most recent winner in this category for their work on *Everything Everywhere All at Once* and the third duo to win after Robert Wise & Jerome Robbins (*West Side Story*) and the Coen brothers (*No Country for Old Men*).\n\n\n\n\n## Winners and nominees[edit]\n\n\nIn the following table, the years are listed as per Academy convention, and generally correspond to the year of film release in Los Angeles County, California; the ceremonies are always held the following year.[9] For the first five ceremonies, the eligibility period spanned twelve months from August 1 to July 31.[10] For the 6th ceremony held in 1934, the eligibility period lasted from August 1, 1932, to December 31, 1933.[10] Since the 7th ceremony held in 1935, the period of eligibility became the full previous calendar year from January 1 to December 31.[10]\n\n\n\n![](image)Frank Borzage won twice: \"Dramatic director\" at the first ceremony, for *7th Heaven* (1927); & later, *Bad Girl* (1931).\n![](image)Lewis Milestone won twice: \"Comedy director\" at the first ceremony, for *Two Arabian Knights* (1927); & later, *All Quiet on the Western Front* (1930).\n![](image)Frank Lloyd won twice, for *The Divine Lady* (1929) & *Cavalcade* (1933).\n![](image)Frank Capra won thrice, for *It Happened One Night* (1934), *Mr. Deeds Goes to Town* (1936), & *You Can't Take It with You* (1938).\n![](image)John Ford won a record four times, for: *The Informer* (1935), *The Grapes of Wrath* (1940), *How Green Was My Valley* (1941), & *The Quiet Man* (1952).\n![](image)Leo McCarey won twice, for *The Awful Truth* (1937) & *Going My Way* (1944).\n![](image)Victor Fleming won for *Gone with the Wind* (1939).\n![](image)William Wyler, with a record twelve nominations, won thrice, for: *Mrs. Miniver* (1942), *The Best Years of Our Lives* (1946), & *Ben-Hur* (1959).\n![](image)Michael Curtiz won for *Casablanca* (1942).\n![](image)Billy Wilder (*right*, with Gloria Swanson) won twice, for *The Lost Weekend* (1945) & *The Apartment* (1960).\n![](image)Elia Kazan won twice, for *Gentleman's Agreement* (1947) & *On the Waterfront* (1954).\n![](image)John Huston won for *The Treasure of the Sierra Madre* (1948).\n![](image)Joseph L.

Subsequent research by AMPAS has resulted in a list of unofficial or *de facto* nominees, based on records of which films were evaluated by the judges.\n3. **^** Michael Curtiz was not on the original ballot of nominees. However, after the year prior with Bette Davis's omission for *Of Human Bondage*, the resulting furor led to a write-in campaign determined to secure her a nomination. Thus, the Academy relaxed their rules and allowed her performance to be amongst the competition. They permitted this once more, prompting further submissions: Curtiz; Paul Muni for *Black Fury*; and several other categories, including Hal Mohr for *A Midsummer Night's Dream*. Ultimately, Mohr became the only person to win an Oscar as a result of this process. The Academy discontinued this option from the next ceremony forward to prevent any recurrence.\n4. **^** The eligibility period for the 93rd ceremony was extended through to February 28, 2021, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* BAFTA Award for Best Direction\n* Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Director\n* Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing – Feature Film\n* Golden Globe Award for Best Director\n* Independent Spirit Award for Best Director\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Dirks, Tim. \"1927–28 Academy Awards Winners\".
