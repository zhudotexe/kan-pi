It has been serialized in Shueisha's *shōnen* manga magazine *Weekly Shōnen Jump* since March 2018, with its chapters collected and published in 24 *tankōbon* volumes as of October 2023[update]. The story follows high school student Yuji Itadori as he joins a secret organization of Jujutsu Sorcerers to eliminate a powerful Curse named Ryomen Sukuna, of whom Yuji becomes the host. *Jujutsu Kaisen* is a sequel to Akutami's *Tokyo Metropolitan Curse Technical School*, serialized in Shueisha's *Jump Giga* from April to July 2017, later collected in a *tankōbon* volume, retroactively titled as *Jujutsu Kaisen 0*, in December 2018.\n\n\n*Jujutsu Kaisen* is licensed for English-language release in North America by Viz Media, which has published the manga in print since December 2019. Shueisha publishes the series in English on the *Manga Plus* online platform. Two novels, written by Ballad Kitaguni, were published in May 2019 and January 2020, respectively. A 24-episode anime television series adaptation produced by MAPPA, aired on MBS from October 2020 to March 2021; a second season premiered in July 2023. The anime is licensed by Crunchyroll for streaming outside of Asia, which premiered an English dub in November 2020. The anime's original soundtrack was released in April 2021.\n\n\nBy July 2023, the *Jujutsu Kaisen* manga had over 80 million copies in circulation, including related novels, digital versions and *Jujutsu Kaisen 0*, making it one of the best-selling manga series of all time.\n\n\n\n\n## Synopsis[edit]\n\n\n### Setting[edit]\n\n\nIn *Jujutsu Kaisen*, all living beings emanate energy called Cursed Energy (呪力, *Juryoku*), which arises from negative emotions that naturally flow throughout the body. Ordinary people cannot control this flow in their bodies. As a result, they continually lose Cursed Energy, resulting in the birth of Curses (呪い, *Noroi*), a race of spiritual beings whose primary desire is to bring harm to humanity. These Curses are shown as gruesome monsters, ghosts, and *yōkai*.\n\n\nJujutsu Sorcerers (呪術師, *Jujutsushi*, lit. \"Cursed Technique Masters\" or \"Shamans\") are people who control the flow of Cursed Energy in their bodies, allowing them to use it as they please and also to reduce its release. High-ranking Sorcerers and Curses can refine this energy and use it to perform Cursed Techniques (呪術式, *Jujutsushiki*), which tend to be unique to the user or their family. An advanced form of Cursed Technique is Domain Expansion (領域展開, *Ryōiki Tenkai*), which the users build a pocket dimension of variable size. Inside the domain, all of their attacks will always connect and grow in strength.\n\n\n\n### Plot[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of *Jujutsu Kaisen* characters\n\nYuji Itadori is an unnaturally fit high school student living in Sendai. On his deathbed, his grandfather instils two powerful messages within Yuji: \"always help others\" and \"die surrounded by people.\" Yuji's friends at the Occult Club attract Curses to their school when they unseal a rotten finger talisman. Yuji swallows the finger to protect Jujutsu Sorcerer Megumi Fushiguro, becoming host to a powerful Curse named Ryomen Sukuna. Due to Sukuna's evil nature, all sorcerers are required to exorcise him (and, by extension, Yuji) immediately. However upon seeing Yuji retaining control over his body, Megumi's teacher Satoru Gojo brings him to the Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School with a proposal to his superiors: postpone Yuji's death sentence and train under Gojo until he consumes all 20 of Sukuna's fingers so the Curse can be eliminated. At the same time, a group of Cursed Spirits plot a multi-layered attack on the world of Jujutsu sorcery, including the Cursed Spirit Mahito and a corrupted sorcerer named Suguru Geto, who was executed by Gojo a year prior. \n\n\nGojo partners Yuji and Megumi with fellow first-year Tokyo student Nobara Kugisaki training them to become sorcerers, but during a mission gone wrong, Sukuna gains full control of Yuji's body, so Yuji allows the both of them to die. Despite this, Sukuna brings Yuji back to life, having grown an interest in Megumi. Aware the Jujutsu high-ups intend to kill Yuji, Gojo keeps his resurrection a secret to continue training him. Yuji meets fellow student Junpei Yoshino, who falls victim to Mahito's manipulations, leading Yuji to swear vengeance.\n\n\nGojo reveals Yuji being alive during the exchange event between the Tokyo and Kyoto Jujutsu schools. The Kyoto school's principal wants Yuji dead immediately so schemes to get it done, while the Tokyo students help Yuji. During the event, Cursed Spirits attack the schools, but are fought off by Yuji, Gojo, and third-year Kyoto student Aoi Todo, though Mahito steals three \"Death Paintings\" (half-human half-Curses), and summons them.\n\n\nAfter a mission in which Yuji is able to consume several of Sukuna's fingers and kill two of the Death Paintings with Nobara's help, the disfigured second-year Kyoto student Kokichi Muta, who controls the Cursed Corpse Mechamaru, is revealed to be a mole working with Geto and Mahito. Muta betrays them to protect his friends, only to be killed by Mahito. On Halloween, the Cursed Spirits unleash their ultimate plan by releasing several barriers over Shibuya, leading many sorcerers to react. Gojo fights and exorcises various Cursed Spirits, but is sealed away by Geto in a special artifact, the Prison Realm. The events also reveal that the current Geto is not the original but rather Geto's corpse possessed by an ancient sorcerer named Kenjaku.\n\n\nYuji and his allies face Kenjaku's forces in order to rescue Gojo from the Prison Realm. During the chaos, Yuji faces Choso, the third Death Painting sibling, and is defeated, only to be spared due to Choso receiving a vision revealing they are brothers. The Cursed Spirit Jogo force feeds Yuji ten fingers, re-awakening Sukuna, who goes on a rampage that destroys a large portion of Shibuya. Yuji then faces off against Mahito, who mortally wounds Nobara, but with the help of Todo, is able to successfully defeat him for good. However, Kenjaku absorbs Mahito, and using his Cursed Technique, re-awakens thousands of new sorcerers throughout Japan which Kenjaku had been planting for thousands of years, as well as unleashing a slew of Curses on Japan, to usher in chaos and a world of Cursed Spirits reminiscent of the Heian period, the prime period of Jujutsu Sorcerers.\n\n\nIn the aftermath, Yuji and Megumi team up with second-year student Yuta Okkotsu and experienced sorcerer Yuki Tsukumo, with both being special grade Jujutsu Sorcerers, along with Choso and second-year student Maki Zen'in to meet with Master Tengen, an immortal, part-Curse part-human Jujutsu Sorcerer. Tengen reveals Kenjaku's plan to merge the former's consciousness with Japan's human population. The Culling Game, Kenjaku's all-out war between the sorcerers and Curse users of Japan, then begins. Maki goes to the Zen'in compound to collect Cursed Tools she needs, but is forced to kill her entire clan when they lay a trap for her. Meanwhile, Yuji, Yuta, Megumi, second-year student Panda, and third-year student Kinji Hakari, seek out a mysterious woman named \"Angel\" who can free Gojo from the Prison Realm, as well as also find a way to rescue Megumi's step-sister, Tsumiki, from participating in the Games.\n\n\nThe group are able to discover Angel, however during this time, the Culling Game serves its purpose in acquiring a surplus of cursed energy for Kenjaku's plans, while he also succeeds in killing Yuki and capturing Tengen. When the group attempt to save Tsumiki, they learn she has become a host for a reincarnated sorcerer. Sukuna uses this opportunity to execute his ultimate plan, taking control of Megumi's body. He succeeds in doing so, killing Tsumiki and regrouping with Kenjaku, however the reunited main group are able to use Angel's power to free Gojo from the Prison Realm. Gojo, now unsealed, agrees with Sukuna and Kenjaku to fight on December 24. The main group makes plans and gets ready for the ultimate showdown on the day, where Gojo faces off against Sukuna and Megumi's Ten Shadows, eventually managing to beat them. However, Sukuna manages to survive and slices Gojo in half, killing him. Reincarnated sorcerer Hajime Kashimo arrives to face a wounded Sukuna, but as they fight, Sukuna revives into his true form. Sukuna hits Kashimo with the same move he used to kill Gojo, fatally wounding him, but Yuji, implied to have consumed the rest of the Death Paintings with Choso's approval, arrives with Culling Game participant Hiromi Higuruma to fight Sukuna. Elsewhere in the Culling Games, Hazenoki, another reincarnated sorcerer, faces off against Kenjaku before being defeated. Takaba, a modern sorcerer and failed comedian with the power to do anything he finds funny then arrives, and he begins to fight Kenjaku after Kenjaku launches an ineffective attack against Takaba.\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, Gege Akutami published *Tokyo Metropolitan Curse Technical School*, a 4-chapter series that ran in *Jump Giga* from April 28 to July 28.[4][5] This series would serve later as a prequel to *Jujutsu Kaisen*, being retroactively titled as *Jujutsu Kaisen 0*.[6] According to Hiroyuki Nakano, the chief editor of *Weekly Shōnen Jump*, *Jujutsu Kaisen* received unanimous approval in the serialization committee.[7] It debuted in *Weekly Shōnen Jump* on March 5, 2018.[8]\n\n\nAkutami stated that *Neon Genesis Evangelion* influenced the mythological aspects of the series,[9] being also influenced by horror and found footage films.[10] Akutami is particularly a fan of Yoshihiro Togashi, author of *YuYu Hakusho* and *Hunter × Hunter*,[10][11] expressing intentions to have an art style as close as possible to his.[9] The author is also a fan of Tite Kubo, author of *Bleach*, and discussed in an interview with him the similarities between their works.[12][13] Other manga artists who influenced Akutami include Masashi Kishimoto (*Naruto*) and Yusuke Murata (*Eyeshield 21* and *One-Punch Man* illustrator).[9] The magic system of *Jujutsu Kaisen* is largely based on *Hunter × Hunter*, whose fights, in Akutami's words, \"rejects emotional arguments\", stating, however, that like Daisuke Ashihara [ja], *World Trigger*'s author, whose magic system is also similar to Togashi's series, Akutami is trying to find and develop their own style.[10] In particular, Akutami believes the first chapter was a mix of *Bleach* and *Naruto*. Akutami regrets some elements of the first chapter, due to the short appearance of Yuji's grandfather within the story.[14]\n\n\nIn October 2020, Akutami stated that the story's ending and main stages are planned, but that the path between the two remains \"fairly free.\"[9] In February 2021, Akutami stated that the series would probably be finished within two years, declaring, however, no confidence in that statement. Akutami knows how the story for Megumi Fushiguro will end, but not for Sukuna.[15] On June 9, 2021, it was announced that the manga would enter on hiatus due to the author's health issues;[16][17] it resumed publication on August 2 of the same year.[18][19] In December 2022, Akutami hinted that the manga would end within a year, stating during the Jump Festa '23 event: \"If you accompany me for up to one more year (probably), I will be very happy.\"[20]\n\n\n\n## Publication[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of *Jujutsu Kaisen* chapters\n\n*Jujutsu Kaisen* is written and illustrated by Gege Akutami.

sold.[129] In January 2021, *Jujutsu Kaisen*'s first fifteen volumes at the time (including volume 0) took 15 of top 16 spots of Oricon's weekly manga ranking (week of January 11–17), being only surpassed by *Attack on Titan*'s 33rd volume, which topped the list.[130] *Jujutsu Kaisen* was the second best-selling manga series in the first half of 2021 (period between November 2020 and May 2021), behind *Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba*, with over 23 million copies sold,[131] while its 16 volumes at the time (including volume 0), were among the 25 best-selling manga volumes.[132] It was the best-selling manga series in 2021, with over 30 million copies sold;[133][134] its eighteen volumes at the time (including volume 0) were among the top 25 best-selling volumes.[135] It was the

NPD BookScan's monthly top 20 adult graphic novels list since January 2021.[140] They were also ranked on *The New York Times*' Graphic Books and Manga bestseller monthly list since February 2021.[141] According to *ICv2*, *Jujutsu Kaisen* was the seventh best-selling manga franchise for fall 2021 (September–December) in the United States, and it was also the sixth \"most efficient manga franchise\" for retailer bookshelves, based on the website's calculations of which manga franchises had the highest sales per volume.[142]\n\n\n\n#### Critical reception[edit]\n\n\nLeroy Douresseaux of *Comic Book Bin* gave the first volume a score of 8.5/10. Douresseaux praised the series for its characters, plots, settings, and internal mythology, and described it as a \"combination battle manga and horror comic book\".[143] Shawn Hacaga of *The Fandom Post*, in his review of the first volume, compared the series to early *Bleach* and praised it for its world, lore, characters and artwork, concluding that it is a \"solid first volume\".[144] Hannah Collins of CBR found parallels between Yuji and Sukuna and Marvel Comics characters Eddie Brock and Venom. She also noted similarities to *Bleach*, *Blue Exorcist* and *Tokyo Ghoul*. Collins commended the manga and, regarding its then recently announced anime adaptation, concluded that *Jujutsu Kaisen* is a \"darkly enjoyable action series that's sure to be one to watch out for in 2020\".[145] Rebecca Silverman of *Anime News Network* ranked the first volume as a C. Silverman praised the series' use of Japanese folklore and *yōkai* elements, comparing this and Akutami's art style to Shigeru Mizuki's *GeGeGe no Kitarō*, but criticized the story for being \"very generic\". She concluded, \"It has the potential to be more as Akutami gets more comfortable with the serialization process and figures out precisely where the story is going, so it may be worth a second book to be certain. But as of this one, it's just okay, making it the kind of series that gets damned with faint praise\".[146] Azusa Takahashi of *Real Sound* praised its storytelling, setting and \"surprising\" story development, also noting similarities to other works like *Bleach*, *Ushio & Tora* or *Neon Genesis Evangelion*, stating, however, that the series is not only a homage to popular works centered on the battle development, but that it has a \"clever composition that sublimates into originality, so you have to be absorbed in it.\"[147]\n\n\n\n### Anime[edit]\n\n\nThe *Jujutsu Kaisen* anime was awarded \"Anime of the Year\" at the 5th Crunchyroll Anime Awards, while Ryomen Sukuna won the \"Best Antagonist\" category and \"Lost in Paradise feat. AKLO\" by ALI won the \"Best Ending Sequence\" category.[148][149] In January 2021, it was revealed that the anime series was the second most-watched anime series on Crunchyroll in 2020, only second to *Black Clover*, being watched in 71 countries and territories, including North America, South and Central America, Europe, Middle East and North Africa, Africa, Asia and Oceania.[150] The official music video of the series' first opening, \"Kaikai Kitan\" by Eve, reached 100 million views on YouTube in April 2021, being one of the fastest anime openings to hit such number of views.[151]\n\n\nIn 2021, *Jujutsu Kaisen* ranked second in the anime category of the Yahoo! Japan Search Awards, based on the number of searches for a particular term compared to the year before.[152] During the same year, the series became the second most discussed TV show worldwide on Twitter, surpassing *Squid Game*.[153] The series placed nineteenth on the annual Twitter Japan's Trend Awards in 2021, based on the social network's top trending topics of the year.[154] It also won the Best TV Anime award at the 2021 Newtype Anime Awards, while Hiroshi Seko won Best Screenplay for his work on the series.[155] In 2022, the series won the Tokyo Anime Award for Animation of the Year in the television category.[156]\n\n\n\n#### Critical reception[edit]\n\n\nMicah Peters of *The Ringer* said that while the series' \"focused execution\" of *shōnen* tropes makes it \"infinitely watchable\", is its \"specificity, its personality, its ultra-slick stylishness\" what make the show special. He added: \"Like with Park's previous work, there is a sumptuous amount of splashy, expensive, mo-cap-enabled animation, delivering on the action promised by the comics\".[157] Paul Thomas Chapman of *Otaku USA* called it a \"prime example of average material elevated by excellent execution\", adding that it is similar to *Bleach* and *YuYu Hakusho*. Chapman commented that Sunghoo Park \"puts the \"beatdown\" in narrative beats\", being able to \"segue from goofy comedy to chilling horror in an instant\", and that he and the crew at MAPPA \"make this narrative mutability seem effortless\".[158] Ana Diaz of *Polygon* highlighted the 17th episode, praising the series' treatment of its female characters, different to other *shōnen* series. Diaz wrote: \"*Jujutsu Kaisen* goes a step further than avoiding gender tropes by presenting a variety of female perspectives. It's not like there's any right way for these young women to deal with the unique pressures they face. The story lets them disagree, and fight for their perspectives and their place\". She concluded: \"The show's widespread success signals that audiences aren't just ready for change, they're actively craving it. Now, every other creator has the green light to write all kinds of women into their shows\".[159]\n\n\n\n#### Awards and nominations[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Award\n | Category\n | Recipient\n | Result\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2021\n | 11th Newtype Anime Awards | Best TV Anime\n | *Jujutsu Kaisen* | Won\n | [155] |\n| Screenplay Award\n | Hiroshi Seko | Won\n |\n| 5th Crunchyroll Anime Awards | Anime of the Year\n | *Jujutsu Kaisen* | Won\n | [148][149] |\n| Best Protagonist\n | Yuji Itadori | Nominated\n |\n| Best Antagonist\n | Ryomen Sukuna | Won\n |\n| Best Boy\n | Satoru Gojo | Nominated\n |\n| Best Opening Sequence\n | \"Kaikai Kitan\" by Eve | Nominated\n |\n| Best Ending Sequence\n | \"LOST IN PARADISE\" by ALI feat.

It has been serialized in Shueisha's *shōnen* manga magazine *Weekly Shōnen Jump* since March 2018, with its chapters collected and published in 24 *tankōbon* volumes as of October 2023[update]. The story follows high school student Yuji Itadori as he joins a secret organization of Jujutsu Sorcerers to eliminate a powerful Curse named Ryomen Sukuna, of whom Yuji becomes the host. *Jujutsu Kaisen* is a sequel to Akutami's *Tokyo Metropolitan Curse Technical School*, serialized in Shueisha's *Jump Giga* from April to July 2017, later collected in a *tankōbon* volume, retroactively titled as *Jujutsu Kaisen 0*, in December 2018.\n\n\n*Jujutsu Kaisen* is licensed for English-language release in North America by Viz Media, which has published the manga in print since December 2019. Shueisha publishes the series in English on the *Manga Plus* online platform. Two novels, written by Ballad Kitaguni, were published in May 2019 and January 2020, respectively. A 24-episode anime television series adaptation produced by MAPPA, aired on MBS from October 2020 to March 2021; a second season premiered in July 2023. The anime is licensed by Crunchyroll for streaming outside of Asia, which premiered an English dub in November 2020. The anime's original soundtrack was released in April 2021.\n\n\nBy July 2023, the *Jujutsu Kaisen* manga had over 80 million copies in circulation, including related novels, digital versions and *Jujutsu Kaisen 0*, making it one of the best-selling manga series of all time.\n\n\n\n\n## Synopsis[edit]\n\n\n### Setting[edit]\n\n\nIn *Jujutsu Kaisen*, all living beings emanate energy called Cursed Energy (呪力, *Juryoku*), which arises from negative emotions that naturally flow throughout the body. Ordinary people cannot control this flow in their bodies. As a result, they continually lose Cursed Energy, resulting in the birth of Curses (呪い, *Noroi*), a race of spiritual beings whose primary desire is to bring harm to humanity. These Curses are shown as gruesome monsters, ghosts, and *yōkai*.\n\n\nJujutsu Sorcerers (呪術師, *Jujutsushi*, lit. \"Cursed Technique Masters\" or \"Shamans\") are people who control the flow of Cursed Energy in their bodies, allowing them to use it as they please and also to reduce its release. High-ranking Sorcerers and Curses can refine this energy and use it to perform Cursed Techniques (呪術式, *Jujutsushiki*), which tend to be unique to the user or their family. An advanced form of Cursed Technique is Domain Expansion (領域展開, *Ryōiki Tenkai*), which the users build a pocket dimension of variable size. Inside the domain, all of their attacks will always connect and grow in strength.\n\n\n\n### Plot[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of *Jujutsu Kaisen* characters\n\nYuji Itadori is an unnaturally fit high school student living in Sendai. On his deathbed, his grandfather instils two powerful messages within Yuji: \"always help others\" and \"die surrounded by people.\" Yuji's friends at the Occult Club attract Curses to their school when they unseal a rotten finger talisman. Yuji swallows the finger to protect Jujutsu Sorcerer Megumi Fushiguro, becoming host to a powerful Curse named Ryomen Sukuna. Due to Sukuna's evil nature, all sorcerers are required to exorcise him (and, by extension, Yuji) immediately. However upon seeing Yuji retaining control over his body, Megumi's teacher Satoru Gojo brings him to the Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School with a proposal to his superiors: postpone Yuji's death sentence and train under Gojo until he consumes all 20 of Sukuna's fingers so the Curse can be eliminated. At the same time, a group of Cursed Spirits plot a multi-layered attack on the world of Jujutsu sorcery, including the Cursed Spirit Mahito and a corrupted sorcerer named Suguru Geto, who was executed by Gojo a year prior. \n\n\nGojo partners Yuji and Megumi with fellow first-year Tokyo student Nobara Kugisaki training them to become sorcerers, but during a mission gone wrong, Sukuna gains full control of Yuji's body, so Yuji allows the both of them to die. Despite this, Sukuna brings Yuji back to life, having grown an interest in Megumi. Aware the Jujutsu high-ups intend to kill Yuji, Gojo keeps his resurrection a secret to continue training him. Yuji meets fellow student Junpei Yoshino, who falls victim to Mahito's manipulations, leading Yuji to swear vengeance.\n\n\nGojo reveals Yuji being alive during the exchange event between the Tokyo and Kyoto Jujutsu schools. The Kyoto school's principal wants Yuji dead immediately so schemes to get it done, while the Tokyo students help Yuji. During the event, Cursed Spirits attack the schools, but are fought off by Yuji, Gojo, and third-year Kyoto student Aoi Todo, though Mahito steals three \"Death Paintings\" (half-human half-Curses), and summons them.\n\n\nAfter a mission in which Yuji is able to consume several of Sukuna's fingers and kill two of the Death Paintings with Nobara's help, the disfigured second-year Kyoto student Kokichi Muta, who controls the Cursed Corpse Mechamaru, is revealed to be a mole working with Geto and Mahito. Muta betrays them to protect his friends, only to be killed by Mahito. On Halloween, the Cursed Spirits unleash their ultimate plan by releasing several barriers over Shibuya, leading many sorcerers to react. Gojo fights and exorcises various Cursed Spirits, but is sealed away by Geto in a special artifact, the Prison Realm. The events also reveal that the current Geto is not the original but rather Geto's corpse possessed by an ancient sorcerer named Kenjaku.\n\n\nYuji and his allies face Kenjaku's forces in order to rescue Gojo from the Prison Realm. During the chaos, Yuji faces Choso, the third Death Painting sibling, and is defeated, only to be spared due to Choso receiving a vision revealing they are brothers. The Cursed Spirit Jogo force feeds Yuji ten fingers, re-awakening Sukuna, who goes on a rampage that destroys a large portion of Shibuya. Yuji then faces off against Mahito, who mortally wounds Nobara, but with the help of Todo, is able to successfully defeat him for good. However, Kenjaku absorbs Mahito, and using his Cursed Technique, re-awakens thousands of new sorcerers throughout Japan which Kenjaku had been planting for thousands of years, as well as unleashing a slew of Curses on Japan, to usher in chaos and a world of Cursed Spirits reminiscent of the Heian period, the prime period of Jujutsu Sorcerers.\n\n\nIn the aftermath, Yuji and Megumi team up with second-year student Yuta Okkotsu and experienced sorcerer Yuki Tsukumo, with both being special grade Jujutsu Sorcerers, along with Choso and second-year student Maki Zen'in to meet with Master Tengen, an immortal, part-Curse part-human Jujutsu Sorcerer. Tengen reveals Kenjaku's plan to merge the former's consciousness with Japan's human population. The Culling Game, Kenjaku's all-out war between the sorcerers and Curse users of Japan, then begins. Maki goes to the Zen'in compound to collect Cursed Tools she needs, but is forced to kill her entire clan when they lay a trap for her. Meanwhile, Yuji, Yuta, Megumi, second-year student Panda, and third-year student Kinji Hakari, seek out a mysterious woman named \"Angel\" who can free Gojo from the Prison Realm, as well as also find a way to rescue Megumi's step-sister, Tsumiki, from participating in the Games.\n\n\nThe group are able to discover Angel, however during this time, the Culling Game serves its purpose in acquiring a surplus of cursed energy for Kenjaku's plans, while he also succeeds in killing Yuki and capturing Tengen. When the group attempt to save Tsumiki, they learn she has become a host for a reincarnated sorcerer. Sukuna uses this opportunity to execute his ultimate plan, taking control of Megumi's body. He succeeds in doing so, killing Tsumiki and regrouping with Kenjaku, however the reunited main group are able to use Angel's power to free Gojo from the Prison Realm. Gojo, now unsealed, agrees with Sukuna and Kenjaku to fight on December 24. The main group makes plans and gets ready for the ultimate showdown on the day, where Gojo faces off against Sukuna and Megumi's Ten Shadows, eventually managing to beat them. However, Sukuna manages to survive and slices Gojo in half, killing him. Reincarnated sorcerer Hajime Kashimo arrives to face a wounded Sukuna, but as they fight, Sukuna revives into his true form. Sukuna hits Kashimo with the same move he used to kill Gojo, fatally wounding him, but Yuji, implied to have consumed the rest of the Death Paintings with Choso's approval, arrives with Culling Game participant Hiromi Higuruma to fight Sukuna. Elsewhere in the Culling Games, Hazenoki, another reincarnated sorcerer, faces off against Kenjaku before being defeated. Takaba, a modern sorcerer and failed comedian with the power to do anything he finds funny then arrives, and he begins to fight Kenjaku after Kenjaku launches an ineffective attack against Takaba.\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, Gege Akutami published *Tokyo Metropolitan Curse Technical School*, a 4-chapter series that ran in *Jump Giga* from April 28 to July 28.[4][5] This series would serve later as a prequel to *Jujutsu Kaisen*, being retroactively titled as *Jujutsu Kaisen 0*.[6] According to Hiroyuki Nakano, the chief editor of *Weekly Shōnen Jump*, *Jujutsu Kaisen* received unanimous approval in the serialization committee.[7] It debuted in *Weekly Shōnen Jump* on March 5, 2018.[8]\n\n\nAkutami stated that *Neon Genesis Evangelion* influenced the mythological aspects of the series,[9] being also influenced by horror and found footage films.[10] Akutami is particularly a fan of Yoshihiro Togashi, author of *YuYu Hakusho* and *Hunter × Hunter*,[10][11] expressing intentions to have an art style as close as possible to his.[9] The author is also a fan of Tite Kubo, author of *Bleach*, and discussed in an interview with him the similarities between their works.[12][13] Other manga artists who influenced Akutami include Masashi Kishimoto (*Naruto*) and Yusuke Murata (*Eyeshield 21* and *One-Punch Man* illustrator).[9] The magic system of *Jujutsu Kaisen* is largely based on *Hunter × Hunter*, whose fights, in Akutami's words, \"rejects emotional arguments\", stating, however, that like Daisuke Ashihara [ja], *World Trigger*'s author, whose magic system is also similar to Togashi's series, Akutami is trying to find and develop their own style.[10] In particular, Akutami believes the first chapter was a mix of *Bleach* and *Naruto*. Akutami regrets some elements of the first chapter, due to the short appearance of Yuji's grandfather within the story.[14]\n\n\nIn October 2020, Akutami stated that the story's ending and main stages are planned, but that the path between the two remains \"fairly free.\"[9] In February 2021, Akutami stated that the series would probably be finished within two years, declaring, however, no confidence in that statement. Akutami knows how the story for Megumi Fushiguro will end, but not for Sukuna.[15] On June 9, 2021, it was announced that the manga would enter on hiatus due to the author's health issues;[16][17] it resumed publication on August 2 of the same year.[18][19] In December 2022, Akutami hinted that the manga would end within a year, stating during the Jump Festa '23 event: \"If you accompany me for up to one more year (probably), I will be very happy.\"[20]\n\n\n\n## Publication[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of *Jujutsu Kaisen* chapters\n\n*Jujutsu Kaisen* is written and illustrated by Gege Akutami.

sold.[129] In January 2021, *Jujutsu Kaisen*'s first fifteen volumes at the time (including volume 0) took 15 of top 16 spots of Oricon's weekly manga ranking (week of January 11–17), being only

franchise\" for retailer bookshelves, based on the website's calculations of which manga franchises had the highest sales per volume.[142]\n\n\n\n#### Critical reception[edit]\n\n\nLeroy Douresseaux of *Comic Book Bin* gave the first volume a score of 8.5/10. Douresseaux praised the series for its characters, plots, settings, and internal mythology, and described it as a \"combination battle manga and horror comic book\".[143] Shawn Hacaga of *The Fandom Post*, in his review of the first volume, compared the series to early *Bleach* and praised it for its world, lore, characters and artwork, concluding that it is a \"solid first volume\".[144] Hannah Collins of CBR found parallels between Yuji and Sukuna and Marvel Comics characters Eddie Brock and Venom. She also noted similarities to *Bleach*, *Blue Exorcist* and *Tokyo Ghoul*. Collins commended the manga and, regarding its then recently announced anime adaptation, concluded that *Jujutsu Kaisen* is a \"darkly enjoyable action series that's sure to be one to watch out for in 2020\".[145] Rebecca Silverman of *Anime News Network* ranked the first volume as a C. Silverman praised the series' use of Japanese folklore and *yōkai* elements, comparing this and Akutami's art style to Shigeru Mizuki's *GeGeGe no Kitarō*, but criticized the story for being \"very generic\". She concluded, \"It has the potential to be more as Akutami gets more comfortable with the serialization process and figures out precisely where the story is going, so it may be worth a second book to be certain. But as of this one, it's just okay, making it the kind of series that gets damned with faint praise\".[146] Azusa Takahashi of *Real Sound* praised its storytelling, setting and \"surprising\" story development, also noting similarities to other works like *Bleach*, *Ushio & Tora* or *Neon Genesis Evangelion*, stating, however, that the series is not only a homage to popular works centered on the battle development, but that it has a \"clever composition that sublimates into originality, so you have to be absorbed in it.\"[147]\n\n\n\n### Anime[edit]\n\n\nThe *Jujutsu Kaisen* anime was awarded \"Anime of the Year\" at the 5th Crunchyroll Anime Awards, while Ryomen Sukuna won the \"Best Antagonist\" category and \"Lost in Paradise feat. AKLO\" by ALI won the \"Best Ending Sequence\" category.[148][149] In January 2021, it was revealed that the anime series was the second most-watched anime series on Crunchyroll in 2020, only second to *Black Clover*, being watched in 71 countries and territories, including North America, South and Central America, Europe, Middle East and North Africa, Africa, Asia and Oceania.[150] The official music video of the series' first opening, \"Kaikai Kitan\" by Eve, reached 100 million views on YouTube in April 2021, being one of the fastest anime openings to hit such number of views.[151]\n\n\nIn 2021, *Jujutsu Kaisen* ranked second in the anime category of the Yahoo! Japan Search Awards, based on the number of searches for a particular term compared to the year before.[152] During the same year, the series became the second most discussed TV show worldwide on Twitter, surpassing *Squid Game*.[153] The series placed nineteenth on the annual Twitter Japan's Trend Awards in 2021, based on the social network's top trending topics of the year.[154] It also won the Best TV Anime award at the 2021 Newtype Anime Awards, while Hiroshi Seko won Best Screenplay for his work on the series.[155] In 2022, the series won the Tokyo Anime Award for Animation of the Year in the television category.[156]\n\n\n\n#### Critical reception[edit]\n\n\nMicah Peters of *The Ringer* said that while the series' \"focused execution\" of *shōnen* tropes makes it \"infinitely watchable\", is its \"specificity, its personality, its ultra-slick stylishness\" what make the show special. He added: \"Like with Park's previous work, there is a sumptuous amount of splashy, expensive, mo-cap-enabled animation, delivering on the action promised by the comics\".[157] Paul Thomas Chapman of *Otaku USA* called it a \"prime example of average material elevated by excellent execution\", adding that it is similar to *Bleach* and *YuYu Hakusho*. Chapman commented that Sunghoo Park \"puts the \"beatdown\" in narrative beats\", being able to \"segue from goofy comedy to chilling horror in an instant\", and that he and the crew at MAPPA \"make this narrative mutability seem effortless\".[158] Ana Diaz of *Polygon* highlighted the 17th episode, praising the series' treatment of its female characters, different to other *shōnen* series. Diaz wrote: \"*Jujutsu Kaisen* goes a step further than avoiding gender tropes by presenting a variety of female perspectives. It's not like there's any right way for these young women to deal with the unique pressures they face. The story lets them disagree, and fight for their perspectives and their place\". She concluded: \"The show's widespread success signals that audiences aren't just ready for change, they're actively craving it. Now, every other creator has the green light to write all kinds of women into their shows\".[159]\n\n\n\n#### Awards and nominations[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Award\n | Category\n | Recipient\n | Result\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2021\n | 11th Newtype Anime Awards | Best TV Anime\n | *Jujutsu Kaisen* | Won\n | [155] |\n| Screenplay Award\n | Hiroshi Seko | Won\n |\n| 5th Crunchyroll Anime Awards | Anime of the Year\n | *Jujutsu Kaisen* | Won\n | [148][149] |\n| Best Protagonist\n | Yuji Itadori | Nominated\n |\n| Best Antagonist\n | Ryomen Sukuna | Won\n |\n| Best Boy\n | Satoru Gojo | Nominated\n |\n| Best Opening Sequence\n | \"Kaikai Kitan\" by Eve | Nominated\n |\n| Best Ending Sequence\n | \"LOST IN PARADISE\" by ALI feat.
