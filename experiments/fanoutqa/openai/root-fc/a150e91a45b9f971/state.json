It rose to dominate the personal computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by Windows. The company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO) and subsequent rise in its share price created three billionaires and an estimated 12,000\u00a0millionaires among Microsoft employees. Since the 1990s, it has increasingly diversified from the operating system market and has made several corporate acquisitions, the largest being the acquisition of Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion in October 2023,[3] followed by its acquisition of LinkedIn for $26.2\u00a0billion in December 2016,[4] and its acquisition of Skype Technologies for $8.5\u00a0billion in May 2011.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Microsoft Corporation** is an American multinational technology corporation headquartered in Redmond, Washington. Microsoft's best-known software products are the Windows line of operating systems, the Microsoft 365 suite of productivity applications, and the Edge web browser.

Consequently, in February 2011 Microsoft released a corporate bond amounting to $2.25\u00a0billion with relatively low borrowing rates compared to government bonds.[174] For the first time in 20 years Apple Inc. surpassed Microsoft in Q1 2011 quarterly profits and revenues due to a slowdown in PC sales and continuing huge losses in Microsoft's Online Services Division (which contains its search engine Bing). Microsoft profits were $5.2\u00a0billion, while Apple Inc. profits were $6\u00a0billion, on revenues of $14.5\u00a0billion and $24.7\u00a0billion respectively.[175] Microsoft's Online Services Division has been continuously loss-making since 2006 and in Q1 2011 it lost $726\u00a0million. This follows a loss of $2.5\u00a0billion for the year 2010.[176]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n150. **^** Lundun, Ingrid (September 10, 2021). \"Microsoft acquires TakeLessons, an online and in-person tutoring platform, to ramp up its edtech play\". *TechCrunch*.

Saudi Aramco has partnered with Hyundai to develop a fuel for gas-electric vehicles which will run on petroleum.[128]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Saudi Arabia portal\n* ![icon](image)Energy portal\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nShamoon is capable of wiping files and rendering several computers on a network unusable.\"[42] Richard Clarke suggests the attack was part of Iran's retaliation for the US involvement in Stuxnet.[45] Security researcher Chris Kubecka, who helped the company establish security after the attack, detailed the level of sophistication in her Black Hat USA 2015 presentation[46][47] and episode 30 of Darknet Diaries.[48]\n\n\n\n### 2019 drone attack[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Abqaiq\u2013Khurais attack\n\nOn 14 September 2019, there was a drone attack on two Saudi Aramco plants:[49] the Abqaiq oil processing facility and Khurais oil field.[50] Houthi rebels[51] claimed responsibility for the attack.[52][53] The attack cut 5.7 million barrels per day (bpd) of Saudi crude output, over 5% of the world's supply.[54] There were discussions by Saudi Arabian officials on postponing Aramco's IPO, because the attacks \"sidelined more than half of the kingdom's output\" of oil.[55]\n\n\n\n### 2019 Initial public offering (IPO)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Exploration | * Core sampling\n* Geophysics\n* Integrated asset modelling\n* Petroleum engineering\n\t+ Reservoir simulation\n\t+ Seismic to simulation\n* Petroleum geology\n* Petrophysics\n* Reflection seismology\n\t+ Seismic inversion\n* Seismic source\n |\n| Drilling | * Blowout\n* Completion\n\t+ Squeeze job\n* Differential sticking\n* Directional drilling\n\t+ Geosteering\n* Drill stem test\n* Drilling engineering\n* Drilling fluid\n\t+ invasion\n* Lost circulation\n* Measurement\n* Shale oil extraction\n\t+ Ljungstr\u00f6m method\n* Tracers\n* Underbalanced drilling\n* Well logging\n |\n| Production | * Petroleum fiscal regime\n\t+ Concessions\n\t+ Production sharing agreements\n* Artificial lift\n\t+ Gas lift\n\t+ Pumpjack\n\t+ Submersible pump (ESP)\n* Downstream\n* Enhanced oil recovery (EOR)\n\t+ Gas reinjection\n\t+ Steam injection\n* Midstream\n* Petroleum product\n* Pipeline\n* Refining\n* Upstream\n* Water injection\n* Well intervention\n* XT\n |\n| History | * 1967 Oil Embargo\n* 1973 oil crisis\n* 1979 oil crisis\n* 1980s oil glut\n* 1990 oil price shock\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)*Dammam No. 7* struck oil in 1938, becoming the first commercial oil well in Saudi Arabia.\nSaudi Aramco's origins trace to the oil shortages of World War\u00a0I and the exclusion of American companies from Mesopotamia by the United Kingdom and France under the San Remo Petroleum Agreement of 1920.[16] The US administration had popular support for an \"Open Door policy\", which Herbert Hoover, secretary of commerce, initiated in 1921. Standard Oil of California (SoCal) was among those US companies seeking new sources of oil from abroad.[17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn September 1990, after the start of the Persian Gulf War, Aramco was expected to replace much of the oil production removed from the global market due to the embargo of Iraq and occupied Kuwait. This amounted to producing an extra 4.8 million barrels per day (Mbpd) to keep the global oil market stable. In addition, Aramco was expected to provide all of the coalition aviation and diesel needs. Aramco recommissioned 146 Harmaliyah, Khurais, and Ghawar oil wells with associated gas oil separation plants, and saltwater treatment pipeline, that had been mothballed during the 1980s oil price collapse. Daily production increased from 5.4 Mbpd in July to 8.5 Mbpd in December 1990 after a three-month de-mothball effort.[27]:\u200a125,\u200a135,\u200a148\u2013149,\u200a155\u2013156\n\n\nStarting in 1990, Aramco embarked on an expansion of crude oil sales in the Asian market. Agreements with South Korea, the Philippines, and China resulted.

Originally, Saudi Aramco used Cray Supercomputers (CRAY-1M) in its EXPEC Advanced Research Center (ECC)[95] to assist in processing the colossal quantity of data obtained during exploration and in 2001, ECC decided to use Linux clusters as a replacement for the decommissioned Cray systems. ECC installed a new supercomputing system in late 2009 with a disk storage capacity of 1,050 terabytes (i.e, exceeding one petabyte), the largest storage installation in Saudi Aramco's history to support its exploration in the frontier areas and the Red Sea.[96]\n\n\n\n### Refining and chemicals[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n46. **^** \"Black Hat 2015: Rebuilding IT security after a cyber disaster\". *SearchSecurity*. 10 February 2016.

Aramco continued to operate and manage the former Aramco assets, including its concessionary interest in certain Saudi Arab oil fields, on behalf of the Saudi Arab Government until 1988. In November 1988, a royal decree created a new Saudi Arab company, the Saudi Arabian Oil Company, to take control of the former Aramco assets (or Saudi Aramco)[28] and took the management and operations control of Saudi Arabia's oil and gas fields from Aramco and its partners.

It was created through a restructuring of Google on October 2, 2015,[2] and became the parent company of Google and several former Google subsidiaries.[3][4][5] Alphabet is the world's third-largest technology company by revenue and one of the world's most valuable companies.[6][7] It is considered one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft.\n\n\nThe establishment of Alphabet Inc. was prompted by a desire to make the core Google business \"cleaner and more accountable\" while allowing greater autonomy to group companies that operate in businesses other than Internet services.[4][8] Founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin announced their resignation from their executive posts in December 2019, with the CEO role to be filled by Sundar Pichai, also the CEO of Google. Page and Brin remain employees, board members, and controlling shareholders of Alphabet Inc.[9]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nOn August 10, 2015, Google announced plans to create a new public holding company, Alphabet Inc. Google co-founder and CEO Larry Page made this announcement in a blog post on Google's official blog.[10] Alphabet was created to restructure Google by moving subsidiaries from Google to Alphabet, thus narrowing Google's scope. The new holding company would consist of Google as well as other businesses including X Development, Calico, Nest, Verily, Fiber, Makani, CapitalG, and GV.[11][12][13] Sundar Pichai, the company's Product Chief, became the new chief executive officer of Google, replacing Page, who transitioned to the role of running Alphabet, along with co-founder Sergey Brin.[14][15]\n\n\nIn his announcement, Page stated that the planned holding company would allow for \"more management scale, as we can run things independently that aren't very related\" to Google. He clarified that, as a result of the new holding company, Google would be \"a bit slimmed down, with the companies that are pretty far afield of our main internet products contained in Alphabet instead\".[16] He further stated that the motivation behind the reorganization is to make Google \"cleaner and more accountable and better\" and that that he wanted to improve \"the transparency and oversight of what we're doing\".[4][8]\n\n\nFormer executive Eric Schmidt (now Technical Advisor) revealed in the conference in 2017 the inspiration for this structure came from Warren Buffett and his management structure of Berkshire Hathaway a decade ago.[17] Schmidt said he encouraged Page and Brin to meet with Buffett in Omaha to see how Berkshire Hathaway was a holding company made of subsidiaries with strong CEOs who were trusted to run their businesses.[17]\n\n\nBefore it became a subsidiary of Alphabet, Google Inc. was first structured as the owner of Alphabet. The roles were reversed after a placeholder subsidiary was created for the ownership of Alphabet, at which point the newly formed subsidiary was merged with Google. Google's stock was then converted to Alphabet's stock. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law (where Alphabet is incorporated), a holding company reorganization such as this can be done without a vote of shareholders, as this reorganization was.[18] The restructuring process was completed on October 2, 2015.[2] Alphabet retains Google Inc.'s stock price history and continues to trade under Google Inc.'s former ticker symbols \"GOOG\" and \"GOOGL\"; both classes of stock are components of major stock market indices such as the S&P 500 and NASDAQ-100.[19]\n\n\nOn December 3, 2019, Page and Brin jointly announced that they would step down from their respective roles, remaining as employees and still the majority vote on the board of directors. Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google, assumed the CEO role at Alphabet while retaining the same at Google.[20]\n\n\nThe firm completed a stock split in mid-2022.[21]\n\n\nOn January 20, 2023, Pichai wrote a letter to all employees announcing that the company would be laying off about 12,000 jobs, or 6% of its global workforce. In the letter, Pichai wrote, \"Over the past two years we\u2019ve seen periods of dramatic growth. To match and fuel that growth, we hired for a different economic reality than the one we face today.\"[22]\n\n\n\n## Structure[edit]\n\n\nAlphabet Inc. is the parent of a diverse set of subsidiaries:[23][24][25]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Subsidiary\n | Business\n | Executive Leader\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Calico | Human health (by overcoming aging)\n | Arthur D.

At the same time, it was announced that Google would be reorganized as a limited liability company, Google LLC.[28][29]\n\n\nEric Schmidt said at an Internet Association event in 2015 that there may eventually be more than 26 Alphabet subsidiaries. He also said that he was currently meeting with the CEOs of the current and proposed Alphabet subsidiaries. He said, \"You'll see a lot coming.\"[30]\n\n\nWhile many companies or divisions formerly a part of Google became subsidiaries of Alphabet, Google remains the umbrella company for Alphabet's Internet-related businesses. These include widely used products and services long associated with Google, such as the Android mobile operating system, YouTube, and Google Search, which remain direct components of Google.[11][31]\n\n\nFormer subsidiaries include Nest Labs, which was merged into Google in February 2018[32] and Chronicle which was merged with Google Cloud in June 2019.[33] Sidewalk Labs was absorbed into Google in 2021 following CEO Daniel L. Doctoroff's departure from the company due to a suspected ALS diagnosis.[34]\n\n\nIn January 2021, Loon LLC CEO Alastair Westgarth mentioned in a blog post[35] that the company would be shutting down, citing lack of a scalable and sustainable business model. In July 2021, Alphabet announced Intrinsic, a new robotics software company spun out of X.[36] In November 2021, Alphabet announced a new company named Isomorphic Labs, using artificial intelligence for drug discovery and headed by DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis.[37]\n\n\n\n## Senior leadership[edit]\n\n\n* *Chair:* John L.

Larry Page (2015\u20132018)\n\n\n## Corporate identity[edit]\n\n\nPage explained the origin of the company's name:[16]\n\n\n\n\n> We liked the name Alphabet because it means a collection of letters that represent language, one of humanity's most important innovations, and is the core of how we index with Google search! We also like that it means alpha\u2011bet (Alpha is investment return above benchmark), which we strive for!\n> \n> \n\n\nIn a 2018 talk, Schmidt disclosed that the original inspiration for the name came from the location of the then Google Hamburg office's street address: ABC-Stra\u00dfe.[39]\n\n\nAlphabet has chosen the domain abc.xyz with the .xyz top-level domain (TLD), which was introduced in 2014. It does not own the domain alphabet.com, which is owned by a fleet management division of BMW. Following the announcement, BMW said it would be \"necessary to examine the legal trademark implications\" of the proposals. Additionally, it does not own the domain abc.com, which is the domain of the Disney-owned American Broadcasting Company.[40][41]\n\n\n\n## Finances[edit]\n\n\nFor the fiscal (and calendar) year 2021, Alphabet reported a net income of $76.033 billion. The annual revenue was $257.6 billion, an increase of 41% over the previous fiscal year.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Revenue(mil. USD)\n | Net income(mil. USD)\n | Total assets(mil. USD)\n | Employees\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2016[42] | 90,272\n | 19,478\n | 167,497\n | 72,053\n |\n| 2017[43] | 110,855\n | 12,662\n | 197,295\n | 80,110\n |\n| 2018[44] | 136,819\n | 30,736\n | 232,792\n | 98,771\n |\n| 2019[45] | 161,857\n | 34,343\n | 275,909\n | 118,899\n |\n| 2020[46] | 182,527\n | 40,269\n | 319,616\n | 135,301\n |\n| 2021[47] | 257,637\n | 76,033\n | 359,268\n | 156,500\n |\n| 2022[1] | 282,836\n | 59,972\n | 365,264\n | 190,234\n |\n\n\nAs per its 2017 annual report, 86% of Alphabet's revenues came from performance advertising (through user clicks using AdSense and Google Ads) and brand advertising.[48] Of these, 53% came from its international operations. This translated to a total revenue of US$110,855\u00a0million in 2017 and a net income of US$12,662\u00a0million.\n\n\nOn February 1, 2016, Alphabet Inc. surpassed Apple to become the world's most valuable publicly traded company until February 3, 2016, when Apple surged back over Alphabet to retake the position. Experts cited Apple's lack of innovation as well as increasing Chinese competition as reasons for the poor performance.[49][50]\n\n\nAs of 2019[update], Alphabet is ranked No. 15 on the *Fortune* 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.[51]\n\n\nOn January 16, 2020, Alphabet became the fourth US company to reach a $1 trillion market value[52] entering the trillion dollar companies club for the first time.\n\n\nIn October 2022, Alphabet recorded the weakest quarterly growth, with fewer sales in nearly a decade. The possible global recession, the strong US dollar, and the pandemics all contributed to the slowed economy.[53]\n\n\n\n## Investments and acquisitions[edit]\n\n\n### Investments[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2017, Alphabet Inc. led a Series A round of $71\u00a0million along with Andreessen Horowitz and 20th Century Fox in music startup UnitedMasters, founded by Steve Stoute.[54]\n\n\nIn addition to funding startups, Alphabet also invests in more mature companies, including publicly traded companies like Uber and privately held companies like Medium.[55]\n\n\n\n### Acquisitions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of mergers and acquisitions by Alphabet\n\nAn analysis of the company's investments in 2017 suggested that it was the most active investor in that period, outdoing the capital arm of Intel and also its own best customer. Alphabet, Inc. acquired seven of its own capital-backed startups in the 2017 financial year, with Cisco second having acquired six of the company's previous investments.[56]\n\n\n\n## Lawsuits and controversies[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Criticism of Google, Google litigation, European Union vs. Google, Censorship by Google, and Privacy concerns regarding Google\n\nIn 2017, Alphabet Inc. sued Uber over technology similar to Alphabet's proprietary self-driving car technology. Alphabet's autonomous vehicle technology had been under development for a decade by Alphabet's Waymo (self-driving vehicle division). The proprietary technology is related to 14,000 documents believed to have been downloaded and stolen by a former Waymo engineer, subsequently employed by Uber.[57][58] The lawsuit was settled in February 2018, with Uber agreeing not to use the self-driving technology in dispute and also agreed to provide Waymo with an equity stake of 0.34%, equating to around $245\u00a0million at the firm's early 2018 value.[59]\n\n\nIn October 2018, a class action lawsuit was filed against Google and Alphabet due to \"non-public\" Google+ account data being exposed as a result of a privacy bug that allowed app developers to gain access to the private information of users. The litigation was settled in July 2020 for $7.5 million with a payout to claimants of at least $5 each, with a maximum of $12 each.[60][61][62]\n\n\nIn October 2020, the United States Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit against Alphabet, alleging anti-competitive practices.[63]\n\n\nOn 2 December 2020, the National Labor Relations Board filed a complaint that claimed Alphabet Inc conducted unlawful monitoring and questioning of several workers at Google. The employees in question were fired for unionization attempts and protesting company policies. The board also alleges that Google unlawfully placed employees on administrative leave in retribution. Alphabet Inc has denied any wrongdoing and said it acted legally.[64]\n\n\nOn 7 June 2021, Alphabet Inc., parent company to Google, announced it had settled an antitrust suit with the French *Autorit\u00e9 de la concurrence* with a payment of $270 million. The settlement amounted to less than 0.7% of Alphabet Inc.'s yearly earnings.[65]\n\n\nOn 12 June 2021, it was announced that Japan would launch an antitrust probe into Alphabet Inc. and Apple Inc. to determine whether their dealings with Japanese smartphone makers violate current antitrust measures or could necessitate new ones.[66]\n\n\nIn May 2022, Russian authorities seized Google's Russian bank account,[67] forcing them to file for bankruptcy one month late due to the inability to pay vendors and staff. However, free services such as Google Search, YouTube, Gmail, Maps, Android and Play were to remain available.[68]\n\n\nIn 2023, the company was criticized for conducting mass lay-offs without informing employees before they arrived to work, including many long-tenured and recently promoted employees. According to various posts on social media, several Google employees discovered they had been terminated after they were unable to access their accounts and confirming it through news articles discussing the mass layoffs.[69][70][71]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Google LLC\n* ![](image) San Francisco Bay Area portal\n* ![icon](image) Internet portal\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Alphabet Inc. 2022 Annual Form 10-K Report\".

Since 2007 sales increased from 14.835\u00a0billion to 469.822\u00a0billion, due to continued business expansion.[153]\n\n\nAmazon's market capitalization went over US$1\u00a0trillion again in early February 2020 after the announcement of the fourth quarter 2019 results.[154]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n152. **^** \"Fortune 500 Companies 2018: Who Made the List\". *Fortune*.

Zuckerberg also accredited the decline to increasing competition from TikTok.[81][82][83] On October 27, 2022, Meta's market value dropped to $268 billion, a loss of around $700 billion compared to 2021, and its shares fell by 24%. It lost its spot among the top 20 US companies by market cap, despite reaching the top 5 in the previous year.[84]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n\"Meta\" had been registered as a trademark in the United States in 2018 (after an initial filing in 2015) for marketing, advertising, and computer services, by a Canadian company that provided big data analysis of scientific literature.[64] This company was acquired in 2017 by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), a foundation established by Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan, and became one of their projects.[65] Following the rebranding announcement, CZI announced that it had already decided to deprioritize the earlier Meta project, that it would be transferring its rights to the name to Meta Platforms, and that the project would end in 2022.[66]\n\n\n\n### 2022\u2013present: Declining profits and mass layoffs[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSee also: Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland \u00a7\u00a0Multinational tax schemes, and Double Irish arrangement \u00a7\u00a0Effect of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\n\nThe US IRS challenged the valuation Facebook used when it transferred IP from the US to Facebook Ireland (now Meta Platforms Ireland) in 2010 (which Facebook Ireland then revalued higher before charging out), as it was building its double Irish tax structure.[156][157] The case is ongoing and Meta faces a potential fine of $3\u20135bn.[158]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEx-Facebook employee Frances Haugen and whistleblower behind the Facebook Papers responded to the rebranding efforts by expressing doubts about the company's ability to improve while led by Mark Zuckerberg, and urged the chief executive officer to resign.[177]\n\n\nIn November 2021, a video published by Inspired by Iceland went viral, in which a Zuckerberg look-alike promoted the Icelandverse, a place of \"enhanced actual reality without silly looking headsets\".[178]\n\n\nIn a December 2021 interview, SpaceX and Tesla chief executive officer Elon Musk said he could not see a compelling use-case for the VR-driven metaverse, adding: \"I don't see someone strapping a frigging screen to their face all day.\"[179]\n\n\nIn January 2022, Louise Eccles of *The Sunday Times* logged into the metaverse with the intention of making a video guide.

FTC alleges that Facebook holds monopolistic power in the US social networking market and seeks to force the company to divest from Instagram and WhatsApp to break up the conglomerate.[114] William Kovacic, a former chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, argued the case will be difficult to win as it would require the government to create a counterfactual argument of an internet where the Facebook-WhatsApp-Instagram entity did not exist, and prove that harmed competition or consumers.[115]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn May 2019, Facebook founded Libra Networks, reportedly to develop their own stablecoin cryptocurrency.[53] Later, it was reported that Libra was being supported by financial companies such as Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and Uber.

It measures only the equity component of a company's capital structure, and does not reflect management's decision as to how much debt (or leverage) is used to finance the firm. A more comprehensive measure of a firm's size is enterprise value (EV), which gives effect to outstanding debt, preferred stock, and other factors. For insurance firms, a value called the embedded value (EV) has been used.\n\n\nIt is also used in ranking the relative size of stock exchanges, being a measure of the sum of the market capitalizations of all companies listed on each stock exchange. The total capitalization of stock markets or economic regions may be compared with other economic indicators (e.g. the Buffett indicator). The total market capitalization of all publicly traded companies in 2020 was approximately US$93 trillion.[6]\n\n\n\n### Historical estimates of world market cap[edit]\n\n\nTotal market capitalization of all publicly traded companies in the world from 1975 to 2020.[6]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | World market cap(in **mil.** US$)\n | World market cap(% of GDP)\n | Number of listedcompanies\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1975\n | 1,149,245\n | 27.2\n | 14,577\n |\n| 1980\n | 2,525,736\n | 29.6\n | 17,273\n |\n| 1985\n | 4,684,978\n | 47.0\n | 20,555\n |\n| 1990\n | 9,519,107\n | 50.8\n | 23,732\n |\n| 1991\n | 11,340,785\n | 56.8\n | 24,666\n |\n| 1992\n | 10,819,256\n | 50.2\n | 24,947\n |\n| 1993\n | 13,897,390\n | 61.7\n | 28,300\n |\n| 1994\n | 14,639,924\n | 60.9\n | 30,290\n |\n| 1995\n | 17,263,728\n | 64.0\n | 33,379\n |\n| 1996\n | 19,806,691\n | 72.3\n | 35,617\n |\n| 1997\n | 22,029,761\n | 80.7\n | 36,946\n |\n| 1998\n | 24,555,201\n | 89.6\n | 37,928\n |\n| 1999\n | 33,181,159\n | 115.1\n | 38,414\n |\n| 2000\n | 30,925,434\n | 101.1\n | 39,892\n |\n| 2001\n | 26,792,162\n | 88.4\n | 40,157\n |\n| 2002\n | 22,802,792\n | 72.7\n | 38,894\n |\n| 2003\n | 31,107,425\n | 84.9\n | 41,051\n |\n| 2004\n | 36,540,980\n | 89.2\n | 38,724\n |\n| 2005\n | 40,512,446\n | 92.6\n | 39,096\n |\n| 2006\n | 50,074,966\n | 106.1\n | 43,104\n |\n| 2007\n | 60,456,082\n | 114.0\n | 44,034\n |\n| 2008\n | 32,418,516\n | 56.2\n | 43,949\n |\n| 2009\n | 47,471,293\n | 83.8\n | 42,669\n |\n| 2010\n | 54,259,518\n | 87.3\n | 43,427\n |\n| 2011\n | 47,521,341\n | 68.8\n | 44,323\n |\n| 2012\n | 54,503,237\n | 78.4\n | 43,772\n |\n| 2013\n | 64,367,842\n | 89.0\n | 44,853\n |\n| 2014\n | 67,177,254\n | 90.3\n | 45,743\n |\n| 2015\n | 62,268,184\n | 94.5\n | 43,983\n |\n| 2016\n | 65,117,714\n | 97.1\n | 43,806\n |\n| 2017\n | 79,501,948\n | 111.1\n | 43,440\n |\n| 2018\n | 68,893,044\n | 91.9\n | 43,554\n |\n| 2019\n | 78,825,583\n | 108.4\n | 43,248\n |\n| 2020\n | 93,686,226\n | 134.7\n |  |\n\n\n## Calculation[edit]\n\n\nMarket cap is given by the formula \n\n\n\n\nMC\n\n=\nN\n\u00d7\nP\n\n\n{\\textstyle {\\text{MC}}=N\\times P}\n\n![{\\textstyle {\\text{MC}}=N\\times P}](image), where *MC* is the market capitalization, *N* is the number of common shares outstanding, and *P* is the market price per common share.[7]\n\n\nFor example, if a company has 4 million common shares outstanding and the closing price per share is $20, its market capitalization is then $80 million. If the closing price per share rises to $21, the market cap becomes $84 million. If it drops to $19 per share, the market cap falls to $76 million. This is in contrast to mercantile pricing where purchase price, average price and sale price may differ due to transaction costs.\n\n\nNot all of the outstanding shares trade on the open market. The number of shares trading on the open market is called the float. It is equal to or less than *N* because *N* includes shares that are restricted from trading. The free-float market cap uses just the floating number of shares in the calculation, generally resulting in a smaller number.\n\n\n\n## Market cap terms[edit]\n\n\nTraditionally, companies were divided into large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap.[8][4] The terms mega-cap and micro-cap have since come into common use,[9][10] and **nano-cap** is sometimes heard. Different numbers are used by different indexes;[11] there is no official definition of, or full consensus agreement about, the exact cutoff values. The cutoffs may be defined as percentiles rather than in nominal dollars. The definitions expressed in nominal dollars need to be adjusted over decades due to inflation, population change, and overall market valuation (for example, $1 billion was a large market cap in 1950, but it is not very large now), and market caps are likely to be different country to country.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Authorised capital\n* List of countries by stock market capitalization\n* List of public corporations by market capitalization\n* Market price\n* Treasury stock\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Market highlights for first half-year 2010\" (PDF).
