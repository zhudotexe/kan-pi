UEFA decided that the opening match would feature Italy if they qualified.[9][112]\n\n\nOf the eleven selected cities and countries, seven cities and six countries had never hosted a European Championship finals match before. Seville was not a venue when Spain hosted the 1964 European Nations' Cup, and none of Azerbaijan, Denmark, Hungary, Romania, Russia or Scotland had hosted the tournament previously. Of the eleven selected stadiums, only two had hosted a European Championship match before: the Stadio Olimpico (1968 and 1980) and the Johan Cruyff Arena (2000). The original Wembley stadium hosted games and the final in UEFA Euro 1996, but although it stood on the same site, this was classified as a different stadium to the current Wembley Stadium.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nInitially, there were 13 venues chosen for the tournament but two were later dropped. Brussels was dropped in December 2017 after the city's Eurostadium was abandoned,[9] while Dublin was dropped in April 2021 because there was no guarantee that spectators could attend. Spain originally intended to use Bilbao as a host venue but later changed it to Seville to allow for spectators at matches.[10] UEFA chose Stadio Olimpico in Rome to host the opening match between Italy and Turkey, while Wembley Stadium in London was selected as a semi-final and final venue for the second time,[11] following the 1996 tournament at the original stadium of the same name.\n\n\nThe tournament was well received by fans and commentators, with the most goals per game in a European Championship since the introduction of the group stage, and only two goalless games. The refereeing style was also praised, with a conservative use of VAR and quick decisions made on the pitch.\n\n\n\n\n## Bid process[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2020 bids\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 13 original venues were selected and announced by UEFA on 19 September 2014.[111] However, the UEFA Executive Committee removed Brussels as a host city on 7 December 2017 due to delays with the building of Eurostadium. The four matches (three group stage, one round of 16) initially scheduled to be held in Brussels were reallocated to Wembley Stadium in London.[9] On 23 April 2021, UEFA announced that due to a lack of guarantees regarding spectators caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Aviva Stadium in Dublin was removed as a tournament host. Their four matches were reallocated to Krestovsky Stadium in Saint Petersburg for the three group stage matches, and Wembley Stadium in London for the round of 16 fixture. Similarly, UEFA reassigned the four matches in Spain elsewhere in the country, with La Cartuja in Seville replacing San Mamés in Bilbao.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 6 December 2012, UEFA announced the tournament would be held in multiple cities across Europe to mark the 60th anniversary of the tournament.[21][22] The selection of the host cities did not guarantee an automatic qualifying berth to the national team of that country. UEFA reasoned that the pan-European staging of the tournament was the logical decision at a time of financial difficulty, such as the European debt crisis.[23][24] Reaction to UEFA's plan was mixed across Europe.[25] Critics cited the expanded format (from 31 matches featuring 16 nations to 51 featuring 24) and its associated additional costs as the decisive factor for only one nation (Turkey) having put forward a serious bid.[26]\n\n\n\n### Bidding venues[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe **2020 UEFA European Football Championship**, commonly referred to as **UEFA Euro 2020** (stylised as **UEFA EURO 2020**) or simply **Euro 2020**, was the 16th UEFA European Championship, the quadrennial international men's football championship of Europe organised by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA).[1] To celebrate the 60th anniversary of the European Championship competition, UEFA president Michel Platini declared that the tournament would be hosted in several nations as a \"romantic\" one-off event, with 11 cities in 11 UEFA countries each providing venues for the tournament, making it the second tournament in the history after the 2007 AFC Asian Cup to have more than two nations co-hosting it.[2] Defending champions Portugal, who won UEFA Euro 2016 in France, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWhile some countries such as Belgium,[12] Bulgaria and Romania,[13] Germany,[14][15] Hungary and Romania,[16] Ireland, Scotland, and Wales,[17] the Netherlands,[18] and Turkey[19] had already expressed an interest in bidding to host the tournament, then-UEFA president Michel Platini suggested at a press conference on 30 June 2012, a day before the UEFA Euro 2012 Final, that instead of having one host country, or joint hosting by multiple countries, the tournament could be spread over \"12 or 13 cities\" across the continent, as was done for the UEFA European Under-17 Championship's elite round, where each of the seven groups was hosted by a different country.[20]\n\n\n\n### European format decision[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe final list of bids was published by UEFA on 26 April 2014, with a decision on the hosts being made by the UEFA Executive Committee on 19 September 2014. There were two bids for the Finals Package (of which one was successful, marked with dark green for semi-finals and final) and 19 bids for the Standard Package (of which 12 were initially successful, marked with light green for quarter-finals and group stage, and yellow for round of 16 and group stage); Brussels, marked with red, were initially selected but removed from the list of venues by UEFA on 7 December 2017.[27][11][28] Dublin, marked in red, was initially selected but removed from the list of venues by UEFA on 23 April 2021. On the same day, UEFA also announced the matches in Spain would be moved from Bilbao to Seville.[10]\n\n\n\nSuccessful bid for group stage and round of 16\n\nSuccessful bid for group stage and quarter-finals\n\nSuccessful bid for semi-finals and final.

The logo depicted the Henri Delaunay Trophy surrounded by celebrating fans on a bridge, which, according to UEFA, represented how football connects and unifies people.[223][224]\n\n\nEach individual host city also had their own unique logo. The rectangular logos featured the text *UEFA EURO 2020* on the top, the city name above the text *host city* on the bottom (all in uppercase), the main tournament logo on the left and a local bridge on the right. Each logo existed in English, along with variations in the local language when applicable.

Every host must guarantee there will be fans at their games.\" UEFA subsequently stated that no host city would be automatically dropped should they decide to play matches behind closed doors. However, UEFA would need to consider whether it would make sense to play matches without spectators, or if these matches should be reallocated to other venues.[56] That same month, British prime minister Boris Johnson offered UEFA to host additional tournament matches in England should any venues need to be reassigned.[57]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n36. **^** \"Executive Committee approves guidelines on eligibility for participation in UEFA competitions\". *UEFA.com*.

UEFA asked each host to devise a spectator plan in conjunction with their local/national government and health authorities. The hosts were given a deadline of 7 April 2021 to communicate their plans with UEFA. On 9 April, UEFA announced that eight of the tournament hosts had confirmed their stadium capacities, ranging from 25% to 100%. The remaining four hosts (Bilbao, Dublin, Munich and Rome) were given an extension until 23 April to submit their venue capacities.[58] On 14 April, UEFA announced that Rome had also confirmed its venue capacity.[59] On 23 April, the venue capacity for Munich was also confirmed, while Bilbao was replaced by Seville, which could guarantee spectators. In addition, Dublin was removed as a host, as it was unable to ensure spectators could attend.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n219. **^** \"Booking List before Final tournament Matchday 3\" (PDF). *UEFA.com*.

It included the official kits and player likenesses for all 55 officially licensed UEFA teams. The update also included five out of eleven venues of the tournament, as well as the official match ball.[245][246]\n\n\n\n### Sponsorship[edit]\n\n\nUEFA had the following sponsorship partners:[247]\n\n\n\n* \"National Team Football Official Sponsors\": Alibaba Group (Alipay brand),[248] Booking Holdings,[249] FedEx,[250] Gazprom,[251] Hisense,[252] and Volkswagen.[253]\n* \"Euro 2020 Official Sponsors\": Coca-Cola,[254] Heineken,[255] Qatar Airways,[256] Takeaway.com,[257] TikTok,[258] and Vivo Mobile.[259]\n* \"Euro 2020 Official Licensees\": Adidas, Hublot, IMG, Konami, and Panini.\n\n\n## Broadcasting[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2020 broadcasting rights\n\nThe International Broadcast Centre (IBC) was located at the Expo Haarlemmermeer in Vijfhuizen, Netherlands.[260]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nUEFA announced the original tournament schedule on 24 May 2018, which only included kick-off times for the opening match and quarter-finals onward.[150][151] The kick-off times of the remaining group stage and round of 16 matches were announced on 30 November 2019 following the final draw.[152] On 17 June 2020, UEFA announced the revised match schedule for the tournament in 2021.[153][154] All match dates, kick-off times and venues remained identical, but shifted one day earlier so matches would remain on the same day of the week (i.e. from 12 to 11 June for the opening match to remain on a Friday). On 23 April 2021, UEFA revised the venue assignments of the match schedule after one stadium was removed from the tournament and another was replaced.[155]\n\n\nGroup winners, runners-up, and the best four third-placed teams advanced to the round of 16.\n\n\n*Times are CEST (UTC+2), as listed by UEFA. If the venue was located in a different time zone, the local time is also given.*\n\n\n\n### Tiebreakers[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe draw for the final tournament was held on 30 November 2019, 18:00 CET (19:00 local time, EET) at Romexpo in Bucharest, Romania.[134][135][136][106] The 24 teams were drawn into six groups of four. The identity of the four play-off teams were not known at the time of the draw and were identified as play-off winners A to D.[137] Should there have been groups that could not be finalised at the time of the final tournament draw, another draw would have been held after the play-offs on 1 April 2020,[1] but UEFA confirmed the additional draw was not necessary after the identity of the 20 directly qualified teams and the 16 play-offs teams was known.[115]\n\n\nThe teams were seeded in accordance with the European Qualifiers overall ranking based on their results in UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying.

UEFA decided that the opening match would feature Italy if they qualified.[9][112]\n\n\nOf the eleven selected cities and countries, seven cities and six countries had never hosted a European Championship finals match before. Seville was not a venue when Spain hosted the 1964 European Nations' Cup, and none of Azerbaijan, Denmark, Hungary, Romania, Russia or Scotland had hosted the tournament previously. Of the eleven selected stadiums, only two had hosted a European Championship match before: the Stadio Olimpico (1968 and 1980) and the Johan Cruyff Arena (2000). The original Wembley stadium hosted games and the final in UEFA Euro 1996, but although it stood on the same site, this was classified as a different stadium to the current Wembley Stadium.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nInitially, there were 13 venues chosen for the tournament but two were later dropped. Brussels was dropped in December 2017 after the city's Eurostadium was abandoned,[9] while Dublin was dropped in April 2021 because there was no guarantee that spectators could attend. Spain originally intended to use Bilbao as a host venue but later changed it to Seville to allow for spectators at matches.[10] UEFA chose Stadio Olimpico in Rome to host the opening match between Italy and Turkey, while Wembley Stadium in London was selected as a semi-final and final venue for the second time,[11] following the 1996 tournament at the original stadium of the same name.\n\n\nThe tournament was well received by fans and commentators, with the most goals per game in a European Championship since the introduction of the group stage, and only two goalless games. The refereeing style was also praised, with a conservative use of VAR and quick decisions made on the pitch.\n\n\n\n\n## Bid process[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2020 bids\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 13 original venues were selected and announced by UEFA on 19 September 2014.[111] However, the UEFA Executive Committee removed Brussels as a host city on 7 December 2017 due to delays with the building of Eurostadium. The four matches (three group stage, one round of 16) initially scheduled to be held in Brussels were reallocated to Wembley Stadium in London.[9] On 23 April 2021, UEFA announced that due to a lack of guarantees regarding spectators caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Aviva Stadium in Dublin was removed as a tournament host. Their four matches were reallocated to Krestovsky Stadium in Saint Petersburg for the three group stage matches, and Wembley Stadium in London for the round of 16 fixture. Similarly, UEFA reassigned the four matches in Spain elsewhere in the country, with La Cartuja in Seville replacing San Mamés in Bilbao.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 6 December 2012, UEFA announced the tournament would be held in multiple cities across Europe to mark the 60th anniversary of the tournament.[21][22] The selection of the host cities did not guarantee an automatic qualifying berth to the national team of that country. UEFA reasoned that the pan-European staging of the tournament was the logical decision at a time of financial difficulty, such as the European debt crisis.[23][24] Reaction to UEFA's plan was mixed across Europe.[25] Critics cited the expanded format (from 31 matches featuring 16 nations to 51 featuring 24) and its associated additional costs as the decisive factor for only one nation (Turkey) having put forward a serious bid.[26]\n\n\n\n### Bidding venues[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe **2020 UEFA European Football Championship**, commonly referred to as **UEFA Euro 2020** (stylised as **UEFA EURO 2020**) or simply **Euro 2020**, was the 16th UEFA European Championship, the quadrennial international men's football championship of Europe organised by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA).[1] To celebrate the 60th anniversary of the European Championship competition, UEFA president Michel Platini declared that the tournament would be hosted in several nations as a \"romantic\" one-off event, with 11 cities in 11 UEFA countries each providing venues for the tournament, making it the second tournament in the history after the 2007 AFC Asian Cup to have more than two nations co-hosting it.[2] Defending champions Portugal, who won UEFA Euro 2016 in France, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWhile some countries such as Belgium,[12] Bulgaria and Romania,[13] Germany,[14][15] Hungary and Romania,[16] Ireland, Scotland, and Wales,[17] the Netherlands,[18] and Turkey[19] had already expressed an interest in bidding to host the tournament, then-UEFA president Michel Platini suggested at a press conference on 30 June 2012, a day before the UEFA Euro 2012 Final, that instead of having one host country, or joint hosting by multiple countries, the tournament could be spread over \"12 or 13 cities\" across the continent, as was done for the UEFA European Under-17 Championship's elite round, where each of the seven groups was hosted by a different country.[20]\n\n\n\n### European format decision[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe final list of bids was published by UEFA on 26 April 2014, with a decision on the hosts being made by the UEFA Executive Committee on 19 September 2014. There were two bids for the Finals Package (of which one was successful, marked with dark green for semi-finals and final) and 19 bids for the Standard Package (of which 12 were initially successful, marked with light green for quarter-finals and group stage, and yellow for round of 16 and group stage); Brussels, marked with red, were initially selected but removed from the list of venues by UEFA on 7 December 2017.[27][11][28] Dublin, marked in red, was initially selected but removed from the list of venues by UEFA on 23 April 2021. On the same day, UEFA also announced the matches in Spain would be moved from Bilbao to Seville.[10]\n\n\n\nSuccessful bid for group stage and round of 16\n\nSuccessful bid for group stage and quarter-finals\n\nSuccessful bid for semi-finals and final.

On 23 April 2021, UEFA revised the venue assignments of the match schedule after one stadium was removed from the tournament and another was replaced.[155]\n\n\nGroup winners, runners-up, and the best four third-placed teams advanced to the round of 16.\n\n\n*Times are CEST (UTC+2), as listed by UEFA.

The identity of the four play-off teams were not known at the time of the draw and were identified as play-off winners A to D.[137] Should there have been groups that could not be finalised at the time of the final tournament draw, another draw would have been held after the play-offs on 1 April 2020,[1] but UEFA confirmed the additional draw was not necessary after the identity of the 20 directly qualified teams and the 16 play-offs teams was known.[115]\n\n\nThe teams were seeded in accordance with the European Qualifiers overall ranking based on their results in UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying.

These venues were to be whittled down to nine by the end of May 2011, but it was suggested in June 2011 that eleven venues might be used.[33][34] The French Football Federation had to choose which nine would actually be used.\n\n\nThe choice for the first seven was undisputed – the national Stade de France, four newly constructed ones in Lille Metropole (Villeneuve-d'Ascq), Décines-Charpieu (Lyon Metropolis), Nice and Bordeaux, and two stadiums in the two largest cities, Paris and Marseille. After Strasbourg opted out for financial reasons following relegation,[35] two more venues were selected to be Lens and Nancy, leaving Saint-Étienne and Toulouse as reserve options.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRomania, Turkey, Austria and Switzerland all returned after missing out in 2012, with the Austrians qualifying for just their second final Euro tournament, after having co-hosted Euro 2008.[22] Returning to the final tournament after long absences were Belgium for the first time since co-hosting Euro 2000, and Hungary for the first time in 44 years, having last appeared at Euro 1972, and 30 years since appearing in a major tournament, their previous one being the 1986 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\nFive teams secured their first qualification to a UEFA European Championship final tournament: Albania, Iceland, Northern Ireland, Slovakia and Wales.[22] Northern Ireland, Slovakia and Wales had each previously competed in the FIFA World Cup, while Albania and Iceland had never participated in a major tournament.[22] Similarly, both Austria and Ukraine completed successful qualification campaigns for the first time, having only previously qualified as hosts (of 2008 and 2012 respectively).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n23. **^** Eccleshare, Charlie (12 October 2015). \"Euro 2016: How will England, Wales, Northern Ireland and possibly Republic of Ireland fare in France?\". *The Daily Telegraph*.

Portugal won the tournament for the first time, following a 1–0 victory after extra time over the host team, France, in the final played at the Stade de France.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nGroup A\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| A1 | ![](image) France |\n| A2 | ![](image) Romania |\n| A3 | ![](image) Albania |\n| A4 | ![](image)  Switzerland |\n\n | \n\nGroup B\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| B1 | ![](image) England |\n| B2 | ![](image) Russia |\n| B3 | ![](image) Wales |\n| B4 | ![](image) Slovakia |\n\n | \n\nGroup C\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| C1 | ![](image) Germany |\n| C2 | ![](image) Ukraine |\n| C3 | ![](image) Poland |\n| C4 | ![](image) Northern Ireland |\n\n | \n\nGroup D\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| D1 | ![](image) Spain |\n| D2 | ![](image) Czech Republic |\n| D3 | ![](image) Turkey |\n| D4 | ![](image) Croatia |\n\n | \n\nGroup E\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| E1 | ![](image) Belgium |\n| E2 | ![](image) Italy |\n| E3 | ![](image) Republic of Ireland |\n| E4 | ![](image) Sweden |\n\n | \n\nGroup F\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| F1 | ![](image) Portugal |\n| F2 | ![](image) Iceland |\n| F3 | ![](image) Austria |\n| F4 | ![](image) Hungary |\n\n |\n\n\n## Venues[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe pitch at Lille received particular attention with players slipping continuously and with groundsmen forced at halftime to try to repair the cut up pitch.[132] Despite UEFA applying numerous methods to rectify the problems, such as a ban on pre-match training on the pitch, use of fertilisers, seeding, mowing, light therapy, drying and playing with the roof closed to avoid rain, it was decided that the pitch at Lille had to be entirely replaced following the Italy–Republic of Ireland group match on 22 June.[133] The new pitch was replaced with Dutch grass and was ready before the last sixteen match between Germany and Slovakia on 26 June.[134][135][136] UEFA also stated that repair work was also required at the St Denis and Marseille pitches.[137] This was the second time that a Euro championship pitch needed to be re-laid mid-tournament. The first time was the St. Jakob-Park in Basel during Euro 2008.[138]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n53 teams competed for 23 places in the final tournament to join France, who automatically qualified as hosts. Gibraltar competed in a European Championship qualifying for the first time since their affiliation to UEFA in 2013. The seeding pots were formed on the basis of the UEFA national team coefficients, with the Euro 2012 champions Spain and hosts France automatically top seeded.\n\n\nThe 53 national sides were drawn into eight groups of six teams and one group of five teams. The group winners, runners-up, and the best third-placed team (with the results against the sixth-placed team discarded) qualify directly for the final tournament. The remaining eight third-placed teams contested two-legged play-offs to determine the last four qualifiers.[14][15][16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n141. **^** \"UEFA orders Euro 2016 stadium pitch relaid\". *New Vision*.

The remaining teams were seeded into four pots of five (Pot 1) or six teams (Pots 2, 3 and 4). As the title holders, Spain were seeded in Pot 1, while the other 22 teams were seeded according to the UEFA national team coefficients updated after the completion of the qualifying group stage (excluding the play-offs), which were released by UEFA on 14 October 2015.[29][30][31][32]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFor the first time, the European Championship final tournament was contested by 24 teams, having been expanded from the 16-team format used since 1996.[6] Under the new format, the finalists contested a group stage consisting of six groups of four teams, followed by a knockout phase including three rounds and the final. Nineteen teams – the top two from each of the nine qualifying groups and the best third-placed team – joined France in the final tournament, who qualified automatically as host; a series of two-legged play-off ties between the remaining third-placed teams in November 2015 decided the last four finalist spots.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 2012\n* 2016\n* 2020\n* 2024\n |\n| Overall records | * Team appearances\n* Player appearances\n* Goalscorers\n\t+ Hat-tricks\n\t+ Own goals\n* Penalty shoot-outs\n* Red cards\n* Winning players\n* Winning managers\n |\n| Miscellaneous | * Awards\n* Music\n* Mascots\n* Balls\n* Video games\n |\n| * † *Postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe*\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* ![](image) Category\n* ![](image) Commons\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* France\n* Georgia\n* Germany\n* Gibraltar\n* Greece\n* Hungary\n* Iceland '15 '16\n* Israel\n* Italy\n* Kazakhstan '15 '16\n* Kosovo\n* Latvia\n* Liechtenstein\n* Lithuania '15–'16 '16\n* Luxembourg\n* Macedonia\n* Malta\n* Moldova\n* Montenegro\n* Netherlands\n* Northern Ireland\n* Norway '15 '16\n* Poland\n* Portugal\n* Republic of Ireland '15 '16\n* Romania\n* Russia\n* San Marino\n* Scotland\n* Serbia\n* Slovakia\n* Slovenia\n* Spain\n* Sweden\n* Switzerland\n* Turkey\n* Ukraine\n* Wales\n |\n| League cups | * England\n* Finland '15 '16\n* France\n* Iceland '15 '16\n* Israel\n* Latvia\n* Northern Ireland\n* Portugal\n* Republic of Ireland '15 '16\n* Romania\n* Scotland\n* Wales\n |\n| Supercups | * Albania\n* Andorra\n* Armenia\n* Azerbaijan\n* Belarus\n* Belgium\n* Bulgaria\n* Cyprus\n* Czech Republic\n* England\n* Estonia '15 '16\n* Faroe Islands\n* France\n* Georgia\n* Germany\n* Gibraltar\n* Hungary\n* Iceland\n* Israel\n* Italy\n* Kazakhstan\n* Lithuania\n* Macedonia\n* Malta\n* Moldova\n* Netherlands\n* Northern Ireland\n* Poland\n* Portugal\n* Republic of Ireland '15 '16\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n53. **^** \"Euro 2016 opening ceremony: can-can girls, giant dancing lips, ballet and... lollipops?\". *www.telegraph.co.uk*.

UEFA's general secretary Gianni Infantino previously described the format as \"not ideal\" due to the need for third-ranked teams in the group stage advancing, leading to difficulty in preventing situations where teams might be able to know in advance what results they needed to progress out of the group; this led to the risk of a lack of suspense for fans, or even the prospect of mutually beneficial collusion between teams.[17]\n\n\n\n## Squads[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2016 squads\n\nEach national team had to submit a squad of 23 players, three of whom had to be goalkeepers, at least ten days before the opening match of the tournament.[42] If a player became injured or ill severely enough to prevent his participation in the tournament before his team's first match, he could be replaced by another player.[16]\n\n\n\n## Match officials[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n149. **^** \"UEFA EURO 2016 logo unveiled\".

Then, in December 2011, Nancy announced its withdrawal from the tournament, after plans for the stadium's renovation were cancelled,[38] finalising the list of host venues at ten.\n\n\nTwo other possible options, the Stade de la Beaujoire in Nantes and the Stade de la Mosson in Montpellier (venues which were used for the 1998 World Cup) were not chosen.

It was the third time that France hosted the finals, after the inaugural tournament in 1960 and the 1984 finals.\n\n\nAs the winners, Portugal earned the right to compete at the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup in Russia.[9]\n\n\n\n\n## Bid process[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2016 bids\n\nFour bids came before the deadline on 9 March 2009.

Initially, twelve stadiums were presented for the French bid, chosen on 28 May 2010. These venues were to be whittled down to nine by the end of May 2011, but it was suggested in June 2011 that eleven venues might be used.[33][34] The French Football Federation had to choose which nine would actually be used.\n\n\nThe choice for the first seven was undisputed – the national Stade de France, four newly constructed ones in Lille Metropole (Villeneuve-d'Ascq), Décines-Charpieu (Lyon Metropolis), Nice and Bordeaux, and two stadiums in the two largest cities, Paris and Marseille. After Strasbourg opted out for financial reasons following relegation,[35] two more venues were selected to be Lens and Nancy, leaving Saint-Étienne and Toulouse as reserve options.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRomania, Turkey, Austria and Switzerland all returned after missing out in 2012, with the Austrians qualifying for just their second final Euro tournament, after having co-hosted Euro 2008.[22] Returning to the final tournament after long absences were Belgium for the first time since co-hosting Euro 2000, and Hungary for the first time in 44 years, having last appeared at Euro 1972, and 30 years since appearing in a major tournament, their previous one being the 1986 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\nFive teams secured their first qualification to a UEFA European Championship final tournament: Albania, Iceland, Northern Ireland, Slovakia and Wales.[22] Northern Ireland, Slovakia and Wales had each previously competed in the FIFA World Cup, while Albania and Iceland had never participated in a major tournament.[22] Similarly, both Austria and Ukraine completed successful qualification campaigns for the first time, having only previously qualified as hosts (of 2008 and 2012 respectively).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n23. **^** Eccleshare, Charlie (12 October 2015). \"Euro 2016: How will England, Wales, Northern Ireland and possibly Republic of Ireland fare in France?\". *The Daily Telegraph*.

It was held in France from 10 June to 10 July 2016.[4][5] Spain were the two-time defending champions, having won the 2008 and 2012 tournaments, but were eliminated in the round of 16 by Italy. Portugal won the tournament for the first time, following a 1–0 victory after extra time over the host team, France, in the final played at the Stade de France.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nGroup A\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| A1 | ![](image) France |\n| A2 | ![](image) Romania |\n| A3 | ![](image) Albania |\n| A4 | ![](image)  Switzerland |\n\n | \n\nGroup B\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| B1 | ![](image) England |\n| B2 | ![](image) Russia |\n| B3 | ![](image) Wales |\n| B4 | ![](image) Slovakia |\n\n | \n\nGroup C\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| C1 | ![](image) Germany |\n| C2 | ![](image) Ukraine |\n| C3 | ![](image) Poland |\n| C4 | ![](image) Northern Ireland |\n\n | \n\nGroup D\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| D1 | ![](image) Spain |\n| D2 | ![](image) Czech Republic |\n| D3 | ![](image) Turkey |\n| D4 | ![](image) Croatia |\n\n | \n\nGroup E\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| E1 | ![](image) Belgium |\n| E2 | ![](image) Italy |\n| E3 | ![](image) Republic of Ireland |\n| E4 | ![](image) Sweden |\n\n | \n\nGroup F\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| F1 | ![](image) Portugal |\n| F2 | ![](image) Iceland |\n| F3 | ![](image) Austria |\n| F4 | ![](image) Hungary |\n\n |\n\n\n## Venues[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe pitch at Lille received particular attention with players slipping continuously and with groundsmen forced at halftime to try to repair the cut up pitch.[132] Despite UEFA applying numerous methods to rectify the problems, such as a ban on pre-match training on the pitch, use of fertilisers, seeding, mowing, light therapy, drying and playing with the roof closed to avoid rain, it was decided that the pitch at Lille had to be entirely replaced following the Italy–Republic of Ireland group match on 22 June.[133] The new pitch was replaced with Dutch grass and was ready before the last sixteen match between Germany and Slovakia on 26 June.[134][135][136] UEFA also stated that repair work was also required at the St Denis and Marseille pitches.[137] This was the second time that a Euro championship pitch needed to be re-laid mid-tournament. The first time was the St. Jakob-Park in Basel during Euro 2008.[138]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n53 teams competed for 23 places in the final tournament to join France, who automatically qualified as hosts. Gibraltar competed in a European Championship qualifying for the first time since their affiliation to UEFA in 2013. The seeding pots were formed on the basis of the UEFA national team coefficients, with the Euro 2012 champions Spain and hosts France automatically top seeded.\n\n\nThe 53 national sides were drawn into eight groups of six teams and one group of five teams. The group winners, runners-up, and the best third-placed team (with the results against the sixth-placed team discarded) qualify directly for the final tournament. The remaining eight third-placed teams contested two-legged play-offs to determine the last four qualifiers.[14][15][16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n141. **^** \"UEFA orders Euro 2016 stadium pitch relaid\". *New Vision*.

The remaining teams were seeded into four pots of five (Pot 1) or six teams (Pots 2, 3 and 4). As the title holders, Spain were seeded in Pot 1, while the other 22 teams were seeded according to the UEFA national team coefficients updated after the completion of the qualifying group stage (excluding the play-offs), which were released by UEFA on 14 October 2015.[29][30][31][32]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFor the first time, the European Championship final tournament was contested by 24 teams, having been expanded from the 16-team format used since 1996.[6] Under the new format, the finalists contested a group stage consisting of six groups of four teams, followed by a knockout phase including three rounds and the final. Nineteen teams – the top two from each of the nine qualifying groups and the best third-placed team – joined France in the final tournament, who qualified automatically as host; a series of two-legged play-off ties between the remaining third-placed teams in November 2015 decided the last four finalist spots.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 2012\n* 2016\n* 2020\n* 2024\n |\n| Overall records | * Team appearances\n* Player appearances\n* Goalscorers\n\t+ Hat-tricks\n\t+ Own goals\n* Penalty shoot-outs\n* Red cards\n* Winning players\n* Winning managers\n |\n| Miscellaneous | * Awards\n* Music\n* Mascots\n* Balls\n* Video games\n |\n| * † *Postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe*\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* ![](image) Category\n* ![](image) Commons\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* France\n* Georgia\n* Germany\n* Gibraltar\n* Greece\n* Hungary\n* Iceland '15 '16\n* Israel\n* Italy\n* Kazakhstan '15 '16\n* Kosovo\n* Latvia\n* Liechtenstein\n* Lithuania '15–'16 '16\n* Luxembourg\n* Macedonia\n* Malta\n* Moldova\n* Montenegro\n* Netherlands\n* Northern Ireland\n* Norway '15 '16\n* Poland\n* Portugal\n* Republic of Ireland '15 '16\n* Romania\n* Russia\n* San Marino\n* Scotland\n* Serbia\n* Slovakia\n* Slovenia\n* Spain\n* Sweden\n* Switzerland\n* Turkey\n* Ukraine\n* Wales\n |\n| League cups | * England\n* Finland '15 '16\n* France\n* Iceland '15 '16\n* Israel\n* Latvia\n* Northern Ireland\n* Portugal\n* Republic of Ireland '15 '16\n* Romania\n* Scotland\n* Wales\n |\n| Supercups | * Albania\n* Andorra\n* Armenia\n* Azerbaijan\n* Belarus\n* Belgium\n* Bulgaria\n* Cyprus\n* Czech Republic\n* England\n* Estonia '15 '16\n* Faroe Islands\n* France\n* Georgia\n* Germany\n* Gibraltar\n* Hungary\n* Iceland\n* Israel\n* Italy\n* Kazakhstan\n* Lithuania\n* Macedonia\n* Malta\n* Moldova\n* Netherlands\n* Northern Ireland\n* Poland\n* Portugal\n* Republic of Ireland '15 '16\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n53. **^** \"Euro 2016 opening ceremony: can-can girls, giant dancing lips, ballet and... lollipops?\". *www.telegraph.co.uk*.

UEFA's general secretary Gianni Infantino previously described the format as \"not ideal\" due to the need for third-ranked teams in the group stage advancing, leading to difficulty in preventing situations where teams might be able to know in advance what results they needed to progress out of the group; this led to the risk of a lack of suspense for fans, or even the prospect of mutually beneficial collusion between teams.[17]\n\n\n\n## Squads[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2016 squads\n\nEach national team had to submit a squad of 23 players, three of whom had to be goalkeepers, at least ten days before the opening match of the tournament.[42] If a player became injured or ill severely enough to prevent his participation in the tournament before his team's first match, he could be replaced by another player.[16]\n\n\n\n## Match officials[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n149. **^** \"UEFA EURO 2016 logo unveiled\".

In a return to the format used at Euro 1992, Euro 1996 and Euro 2008, each of the four groups' matches were played in two stadiums. Host cities Warsaw, Gdańsk, Wrocław, Poznań, Kyiv, and Lviv are all popular tourist destinations, unlike Donetsk and Kharkiv, the latter of which replaced Dnipropetrovsk as a host city in 2009.[26]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUEFA Euro 2012 stadiums\n |\n| --- |\n| Poland | * National Stadium (Warsaw)\n* Gdańsk Stadium (Gdańsk)\n* Wrocław Stadium (Wrocław)\n* Poznań Stadium (Poznań)\n |\n| Ukraine | * NSC Olimpiyskiy (Kyiv)\n* Donbass Arena (Donetsk)\n* Metalist Stadium (Kharkiv)\n* Arena Lviv (Lviv)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn order to meet UEFA's requirement for football infrastructure improvements, five new stadiums were built and opened in advance of the tournament. The remaining three stadiums (in Kyiv, Poznań and Kharkiv) underwent major renovations in order to meet UEFA's infrastructure standards.[27][28] Three of the stadiums are categorised as UEFA's highest category stadiums. The transport infrastructure in Poland and Ukraine was also extensively modified on the request of UEFA to cope with the large influx of football fans.[29]\n\n\nUEFA organised fan zones in the eight host cities. They were located in the centre of each city, with all 31 matches shown live on a total of 24 giant screens. The zones enabled supporters to come together in a secure and controlled environment. The Warsaw Fan Zone occupied 120,000 square meters and accommodated 100,000 visitors. In all, the fans zones had a 20% increase in capacity compared to Euro 2008.[30]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEuro 2012 was played at eight venues, four in each host country. Five new stadiums were built for the tournament, and the hosts invested heavily in improving infrastructure such as railways and roads at UEFA's request. Euro 2012 set attendance records for the 16-team format, for the highest aggregate attendance (1,440,896) and average per game (46,481).\n\n\nSpain became the first team to win two consecutive European Championships, and also three straight major tournaments (Euro 2008, 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012).[3] Spain had already gained entry to the 2013 Confederations Cup by winning the World Cup, so runners-up Italy qualified instead. As at Euro 2008 in Austria and Switzerland, both 2012 host nations were eliminated in the group stage.\n\n\nThere were several players ending on a total of 3 goals but because Fernando Torres made an assist and played the fewest minutes of the players who scored three goals, he was named as the Golden Boot winner for the tournament.\n\n\n\n\n## Bid process[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPoland–Ukraine became the third successful joint bid for the European Championship, after those of Belgium–Netherlands (2000) and Austria–Switzerland (2008). Their bid received an absolute majority of votes, and was therefore announced the winner, without requiring a second round. Italy, which received the remaining votes,[2] had been considered favourites to win the hosting, but incidents of fan violence and a match-fixing scandal were widely cited as factors behind their failure.[9][10][11]\n\n\nThere were some later alterations from the initial bid plan, regarding the venues, before UEFA confirmed the eight host cities in 2009.[12][13] During the preparation process in Poland and Ukraine, UEFA repeatedly expressed concern about their preparation to host the event, with different candidates reported as being alternative hosts if they did not improve;[14][15] however, in the end, UEFA affirmed their selection.[16]\n\n\n\n## Qualification[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Spain overpower Italy to win UEFA EURO 2012\".

One of the co-hosts, Ukraine, made their debut as an independent nation (before 1992 Ukraine participated as part of the Soviet Union). With the exception of Serbia – according to UEFA's ranking at the end of the qualifying stage – Europe's sixteen highest-ranked teams all qualified for the tournament.\n\n\nRomania and Turkey were the only teams failing to qualify for the final tournament after qualifying to UEFA Euro 2008.

The final tournament, held between 8 June and 1 July 2012, was co-hosted by Poland and Ukraine (both first time hosts), and was won by Spain, who beat Italy in the final at the Olympic Stadium, Kyiv, Ukraine.[1]\n\n\nPoland and Ukraine's bid was chosen by the UEFA Executive Committee on 18 April 2007.[2] The two host teams qualified automatically while the remaining 14 finalists were decided through a qualifying competition, featuring 51 teams, from August 2010 to November 2011. This was the last European Championship to employ the 16-team finals format in use since 1996; from Euro 2016 onward, it was expanded to 24 finalists.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n17. **^** Chaplin, Mark (30 January 2009). \"UEFA lays out priorities for 2009\". *UEFA.com*.

Applications had to be made during March 2011 for the 1.4 million tickets available for the 31 tournament matches.[31] Over 20,000 were forecast to cross the Poland–Ukraine border each day during the tournament.[32] Over 12 million applications were received, which represented a 17% increase on the 2008 finals, and an all-time record for the UEFA European Championship.[33] Owing to this over-subscription for the matches, lotteries were carried out to allocate tickets. Prices varied from €30 (£25) (for a seat behind the goals at a group match) to €600 (£513) (for a seat in the main stand at the final). In addition to individual match tickets, fans could buy packages to see either all matches played by one team, or all matches at one specific venue.[34]\n\n\n\n### Team base camps[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe draw for the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying competition took place in Warsaw on 7 February 2010.[17] Fifty-one teams entered to compete for the fourteen remaining places in the finals, alongside co-hosts Poland and Ukraine. The teams were divided into nine groups, with the draw using the new UEFA national team coefficient for the first time in order to determine the seedings. As defending champions, Spain was automatically top-seeded. The qualifying process began in August 2010 and concluded in November 2011. At the conclusion of the qualifying group stage in October 2011, the nine group winners qualified automatically, along with the highest ranked second placed team. The remaining eight-second placed teams contested two-legged play-offs, and the four winners qualified for the finals.[18]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOlympic Stadium, Kyiv\nAttendance: 64,640[69]\nReferee: Damir Skomina (Slovenia)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n19 June 2012 (2012-06-19)\n21:45 EEST\n\n\n| England ![](image) | 1–0 | ![](image) Ukraine |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Rooney ![](image) 48'\n | Report |  |\n\nDonbass Arena, Donetsk\nAttendance: 48,700[70]\nReferee: Viktor Kassai (Hungary)\n\n19 June 2012 (2012-06-19)\n21:45 EEST\n\n\n| Sweden ![](image) | 2–0 | ![](image) France |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Ibrahimović ![](image) 54'\n* Larsson ![](image) 90+1'\n | Report |  |\n\nOlympic Stadium, Kyiv\nAttendance: 63,010[71]\nReferee: Pedro Proença (Portugal)\n\n## Knockout stage[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2012 knockout stage\n\n![](image)Spain players holding the *Henri Delaunay Trophy*.\nIn the knockout phase, extra time and a penalty shoot-out were used to decide the winner if necessary.\n\n\nAs with every tournament since UEFA Euro 1984, there was no third place play-off.\n\n\n\n### Bracket[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEach team had a \"team base camp\" for its stay between the matches. From an initial list of thirty-eight potential locations (twenty-one in Poland, seventeen in Ukraine),[35] the national associations chose their locations in 2011.

This was required due to the fact that the matches were broadcast in HD quality.[127] The multilateral production utilised 31 cameras to cover the action on and around the pitch at every match, with additional cameras following activities around the game, such as team arrivals at the stadiums, interviews, and media conferences.[128] The official Euro 2012 broadcasting centre was located at the Expo XXI International Centre in Warsaw.[127] The tournament was broadcast live by around 100 TV channels covering the whole world.[129] 150,000,000 people were expected to watch the matches each day.[130]\n\n\n\n## Concerns and controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Concerns and controversies related to UEFA Euro 2012\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ![Republic of Ireland](image) Sean St Ledger\n* ![Russia](image) Roman Pavlyuchenko\n* ![Russia](image) Roman Shirokov\n* ![Spain](image) Jordi Alba\n* ![Spain](image) Juan Mata\n* ![Spain](image) Jesús Navas\n* ![Sweden](image) Sebastian Larsson\n* ![Sweden](image) Olof Mellberg\n\n**1 own goal**\n\n\n\n* ![England](image) Glen Johnson (against Sweden)\nSource: UEFA[79]\n\n\n### Awards[edit]\n\n\nSee also: UEFA European Championship awards\n\nUEFA Team of the Tournament\nThe UEFA Technical Team was charged with naming a squad composed of the 23 best players over the course of the tournament.[80] The group of eleven analysts watched every game at the tournament before making their decision after the final.

Variations of the ball have been used in other contemporary competitions including the Africa Cup of Nations and the Summer Olympics. It is designed to be easier to dribble and control than the reportedly unpredictable Adidas Jabulani used at the 2010 FIFA World Cup.[38]\n\n\n\n## Squads[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2012 squads\n\nEach national team had to submit a squad of 23 players, three of whom must be goalkeepers, at least ten days before the opening match of the tournament.

In a return to the format used at Euro 1992, Euro 1996 and Euro 2008, each of the four groups' matches were played in two stadiums. Host cities Warsaw, Gdańsk, Wrocław, Poznań, Kyiv, and Lviv are all popular tourist destinations, unlike Donetsk and Kharkiv, the latter of which replaced Dnipropetrovsk as a host city in 2009.[26]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUEFA Euro 2012 stadiums\n |\n| --- |\n| Poland | * National Stadium (Warsaw)\n* Gdańsk Stadium (Gdańsk)\n* Wrocław Stadium (Wrocław)\n* Poznań Stadium (Poznań)\n |\n| Ukraine | * NSC Olimpiyskiy (Kyiv)\n* Donbass Arena (Donetsk)\n* Metalist Stadium (Kharkiv)\n* Arena Lviv (Lviv)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn order to meet UEFA's requirement for football infrastructure improvements, five new stadiums were built and opened in advance of the tournament. The remaining three stadiums (in Kyiv, Poznań and Kharkiv) underwent major renovations in order to meet UEFA's infrastructure standards.[27][28] Three of the stadiums are categorised as UEFA's highest category stadiums. The transport infrastructure in Poland and Ukraine was also extensively modified on the request of UEFA to cope with the large influx of football fans.[29]\n\n\nUEFA organised fan zones in the eight host cities. They were located in the centre of each city, with all 31 matches shown live on a total of 24 giant screens. The zones enabled supporters to come together in a secure and controlled environment. The Warsaw Fan Zone occupied 120,000 square meters and accommodated 100,000 visitors. In all, the fans zones had a 20% increase in capacity compared to Euro 2008.[30]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEuro 2012 was played at eight venues, four in each host country. Five new stadiums were built for the tournament, and the hosts invested heavily in improving infrastructure such as railways and roads at UEFA's request. Euro 2012 set attendance records for the 16-team format, for the highest aggregate attendance (1,440,896) and average per game (46,481).\n\n\nSpain became the first team to win two consecutive European Championships, and also three straight major tournaments (Euro 2008, 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012).[3] Spain had already gained entry to the 2013 Confederations Cup by winning the World Cup, so runners-up Italy qualified instead. As at Euro 2008 in Austria and Switzerland, both 2012 host nations were eliminated in the group stage.\n\n\nThere were several players ending on a total of 3 goals but because Fernando Torres made an assist and played the fewest minutes of the players who scored three goals, he was named as the Golden Boot winner for the tournament.\n\n\n\n\n## Bid process[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPoland–Ukraine became the third successful joint bid for the European Championship, after those of Belgium–Netherlands (2000) and Austria–Switzerland (2008). Their bid received an absolute majority of votes, and was therefore announced the winner, without requiring a second round. Italy, which received the remaining votes,[2] had been considered favourites to win the hosting, but incidents of fan violence and a match-fixing scandal were widely cited as factors behind their failure.[9][10][11]\n\n\nThere were some later alterations from the initial bid plan, regarding the venues, before UEFA confirmed the eight host cities in 2009.[12][13] During the preparation process in Poland and Ukraine, UEFA repeatedly expressed concern about their preparation to host the event, with different candidates reported as being alternative hosts if they did not improve;[14][15] however, in the end, UEFA affirmed their selection.[16]\n\n\n\n## Qualification[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Spain overpower Italy to win UEFA EURO 2012\".

One of the co-hosts, Ukraine, made their debut as an independent nation (before 1992 Ukraine participated as part of the Soviet Union). With the exception of Serbia – according to UEFA's ranking at the end of the qualifying stage – Europe's sixteen highest-ranked teams all qualified for the tournament.\n\n\nRomania and Turkey were the only teams failing to qualify for the final tournament after qualifying to UEFA Euro 2008. (Austria and Switzerland also failed to qualify, but, as hosts of the previous tournament, they didn't took part in the qualifications.)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nInternational football competition\n\nThe **2012 UEFA European Football Championship**, commonly referred to as **UEFA Euro 2012** or simply **Euro 2012**, was the 14th European Championship for men's national football teams organised by UEFA. The final tournament, held between 8 June and 1 July 2012, was co-hosted by Poland and Ukraine (both first time hosts), and was won by Spain, who beat Italy in the final at the Olympic Stadium, Kyiv, Ukraine.[1]\n\n\nPoland and Ukraine's bid was chosen by the UEFA Executive Committee on 18 April 2007.[2] The two host teams qualified automatically while the remaining 14 finalists were decided through a qualifying competition, featuring 51 teams, from August 2010 to November 2011. This was the last European Championship to employ the 16-team finals format in use since 1996; from Euro 2016 onward, it was expanded to 24 finalists.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n17. **^** Chaplin, Mark (30 January 2009). \"UEFA lays out priorities for 2009\". *UEFA.com*.

Applications had to be made during March 2011 for the 1.4 million tickets available for the 31 tournament matches.[31] Over 20,000 were forecast to cross the Poland–Ukraine border each day during the tournament.[32] Over 12 million applications were received, which represented a 17% increase on the 2008 finals, and an all-time record for the UEFA European Championship.[33] Owing to this over-subscription for the matches, lotteries were carried out to allocate tickets. Prices varied from €30 (£25) (for a seat behind the goals at a group match) to €600 (£513) (for a seat in the main stand at the final). In addition to individual match tickets, fans could buy packages to see either all matches played by one team, or all matches at one specific venue.[34]\n\n\n\n### Team base camps[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe draw for the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying competition took place in Warsaw on 7 February 2010.[17] Fifty-one teams entered to compete for the fourteen remaining places in the finals, alongside co-hosts Poland and Ukraine. The teams were divided into nine groups, with the draw using the new UEFA national team coefficient for the first time in order to determine the seedings. As defending champions, Spain was automatically top-seeded. The qualifying process began in August 2010 and concluded in November 2011. At the conclusion of the qualifying group stage in October 2011, the nine group winners qualified automatically, along with the highest ranked second placed team. The remaining eight-second placed teams contested two-legged play-offs, and the four winners qualified for the finals.[18]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOlympic Stadium, Kyiv\nAttendance: 64,640[69]\nReferee: Damir Skomina (Slovenia)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n19 June 2012 (2012-06-19)\n21:45 EEST\n\n\n| England ![](image) | 1–0 | ![](image) Ukraine |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Rooney ![](image) 48'\n | Report |  |\n\nDonbass Arena, Donetsk\nAttendance: 48,700[70]\nReferee: Viktor Kassai (Hungary)\n\n19 June 2012 (2012-06-19)\n21:45 EEST\n\n\n| Sweden ![](image) | 2–0 | ![](image) France |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Ibrahimović ![](image) 54'\n* Larsson ![](image) 90+1'\n | Report |  |\n\nOlympic Stadium, Kyiv\nAttendance: 63,010[71]\nReferee: Pedro Proença (Portugal)\n\n## Knockout stage[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2012 knockout stage\n\n![](image)Spain players holding the *Henri Delaunay Trophy*.\nIn the knockout phase, extra time and a penalty shoot-out were used to decide the winner if necessary.\n\n\nAs with every tournament since UEFA Euro 1984, there was no third place play-off.\n\n\n\n### Bracket[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEach team had a \"team base camp\" for its stay between the matches. From an initial list of thirty-eight potential locations (twenty-one in Poland, seventeen in Ukraine),[35] the national associations chose their locations in 2011.

Teams in groups A and B were separated from teams in groups C and D until the final. This meant that two teams who meet in the same group would meet again in the semi-finals instead of the final if they got this far. Also, in another major change, for the first time in a European Championship, only two venues (St. Jakob-Park, Basel and Ernst-Happel-Stadion, Vienna—the two largest of the eight stadiums used) were used for the seven matches in the knockout phase of the tournament.[47]\n\n\nAs with every tournament since UEFA Euro 1984, there was no third place play-off.\n\n\n*All times are local, CEST (UTC+2).*\n\n\n\n### Bracket[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2004, the Zürich venue became a problem for the organisers. Originally, the Hardturm stadium was to be renovated and used as the city's venue, but legal challenges delayed the plan to a point that would not have allowed the ground to be used in 2008. This created a problem, as the agreement between UEFA and the organisers stipulated that four venues would be used in each country. The problem was solved when the organisers proposed renovating Letzigrund instead;[16] UEFA approved the revised plan in January 2005. The Letzigrund stadium hosted its first football match on 23 September 2007.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUEFA Euro 2008\n |\n| --- |\n| Stages | * Qualification\n* Group stage\n\t+ Group A\n\t+ Group B\n\t+ Group C\n\t+ Group D\n* Knockout phase\n* Final\n |\n| General information | * Bids\n\t+ Scotland–Ireland\n* Broadcasting\n* Squads\n* Statistics\n |\n| Official symbols | * Europass (ball)\n* Trix and Flix (mascot)\n* *UEFA Euro 2008* (video game)\n* \"Can You Hear Me\" (song)\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUEFA Euro 2008 finalists\n |\n| --- |\n| Champions | **Spain**\n |\n| Runners-up | Germany\n |\n| Eliminated in the semi-finals | * Russia\n* Turkey\n |\n| Eliminated in the quarter-finals | * Croatia\n* Italy\n* Netherlands\n* Portugal\n |\n| Eliminated in the group stage | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Group A | * Czech Republic\n* Switzerland\n |\n| Group B | * Austria\n* Poland\n |\n| Group C | * France\n* Romania\n |\n| Group D | * Greece\n* Sweden\n |\n\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n12 out of 16 teams who qualified for previous tournament also qualified, but the hosts, Austria, and Poland made their debuts at the European Championship.

It took place in Austria and Switzerland (both hosting the tournament for the first time) from 7 to 29 June 2008.\n\n\nThe tournament was won by Spain, who defeated Germany 1–0 in the final. Spain were only the second nation to win all their group stage fixtures and then the European Championship itself, matching France's achievement from 1984. Spain were also the first team since Germany in 1996 to win the tournament undefeated.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** \"UEFA National Team Ranking 2007\".

The names of the winning countries that had appeared on the plinth have now been engraved on the back of the trophy, which is made of sterling silver, weighs 8 kilograms (17.6 lb) and is 60 centimetres (24 in) tall.\n\n\n\n### Match ball[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A large model of the *adidas Europass* prior to the final between Germany and Spain\nThe match ball for the finals was unveiled at the draw ceremony.

Austria and Switzerland automatically qualified for the tournament finals as host nations.\n\n\nThe qualifying format was changed compared to previous tournaments. The winners and runners-up from seven groups automatically qualified for the Championship, with the hosts filling the other two slots in the 16-team tournament. The change means there were no play-offs between teams finishing in second place in the groups – they qualified directly for the finals. Teams that finished outside the top two positions in their groups failed to qualify. Group A contained eight teams, and the others contained seven.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n73. **^** Dean, Will (18 June 2012). \"Trending: The Euro 2012 chant that a Seven Nation Army couldn't hold back\". *The Independent*.

The qualifying tournament was contested by national teams from each of UEFA's member associations except Austria and Switzerland, who had automatically qualified for the final tournament as hosts, and Montenegro, who came into existence too late to be admitted to UEFA. England was the only seeded team not to qualify for the tournament proper, whereas Russia was the only unseeded one to qualify. The tournament also marked the debuts of Austria and Poland.\n\n\nThe draw for the final tournament took place on 2 December 2007, and saw Group C immediately labelled as the \"group of death\", with Italy, France, Romania and the Netherlands competing for the two qualifying places. In contrast, Germany and Portugal were deemed to have an easy draw, as the tournament structure meant they could not meet Italy, France, the Netherlands or Spain until the final.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSt. Jakob-Park, Basel\nAttendance: 39,730[27]\nReferee: Konrad Plautz (Austria)\n\n15 June 2008 (2008-06-15)\n20:45\n\n\n| Turkey ![](image) | 3–2 | ![](image) Czech Republic |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Turan ![](image) 75'\n* Nihat ![](image) 87', 89'\n | Report | * Koller ![](image) 34'\n* Plašil ![](image) 62'\n |\n\nStade de Genève, Geneva\nAttendance: 29,016[28]\nReferee: Peter Fröjdfeldt (Sweden)\n\n### Group B[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2008 Group B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Pos | Team* v\n* t\n* e\n | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts | Qualification\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image) Croatia | 3\n | 3\n | 0\n | 0\n | 4\n | 1\n | +3\n | 9\n | Advance to knockout phase |\n| 2\n | ![](image) Germany | 3\n | 2\n | 0\n | 1\n | 4\n | 2\n | +2\n | 6\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image) Austria (H) | 3\n | 0\n | 1\n | 2\n | 1\n | 3\n | −2\n | 1[a] |  |\n| 4\n | ![](image) Poland | 3\n | 0\n | 1\n | 2\n | 1\n | 4\n | −3\n | 1[a] |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSource: UEFA  \n(H) Hosts  \nNotes:\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Tied on head-to-head result (Austria 1–1 Poland).

In a return to the format used at Euro 1992 and Euro 1996 the games in each group were held at just two stadia, with the seeded team playing all three matches in the same city.

Teams in groups A and B were separated from teams in groups C and D until the final. This meant that two teams who meet in the same group would meet again in the semi-finals instead of the final if they got this far. Also, in another major change, for the first time in a European Championship, only two venues (St. Jakob-Park, Basel and Ernst-Happel-Stadion, Vienna—the two largest of the eight stadiums used) were used for the seven matches in the knockout phase of the tournament.[47]\n\n\nAs with every tournament since UEFA Euro 1984, there was no third place play-off.\n\n\n*All times are local, CEST (UTC+2).*\n\n\n\n### Bracket[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2004, the Zürich venue became a problem for the organisers. Originally, the Hardturm stadium was to be renovated and used as the city's venue, but legal challenges delayed the plan to a point that would not have allowed the ground to be used in 2008. This created a problem, as the agreement between UEFA and the organisers stipulated that four venues would be used in each country. The problem was solved when the organisers proposed renovating Letzigrund instead;[16] UEFA approved the revised plan in January 2005. The Letzigrund stadium hosted its first football match on 23 September 2007.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUEFA Euro 2008\n |\n| --- |\n| Stages | * Qualification\n* Group stage\n\t+ Group A\n\t+ Group B\n\t+ Group C\n\t+ Group D\n* Knockout phase\n* Final\n |\n| General information | * Bids\n\t+ Scotland–Ireland\n* Broadcasting\n* Squads\n* Statistics\n |\n| Official symbols | * Europass (ball)\n* Trix and Flix (mascot)\n* *UEFA Euro 2008* (video game)\n* \"Can You Hear Me\" (song)\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUEFA Euro 2008 finalists\n |\n| --- |\n| Champions | **Spain**\n |\n| Runners-up | Germany\n |\n| Eliminated in the semi-finals | * Russia\n* Turkey\n |\n| Eliminated in the quarter-finals | * Croatia\n* Italy\n* Netherlands\n* Portugal\n |\n| Eliminated in the group stage | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Group A | * Czech Republic\n* Switzerland\n |\n| Group B | * Austria\n* Poland\n |\n| Group C | * France\n* Romania\n |\n| Group D | * Greece\n* Sweden\n |\n\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n12 out of 16 teams who qualified for previous tournament also qualified, but the hosts, Austria, and Poland made their debuts at the European Championship.

It took place in Austria and Switzerland (both hosting the tournament for the first time) from 7 to 29 June 2008.\n\n\nThe tournament was won by Spain, who defeated Germany 1–0 in the final. Spain were only the second nation to win all their group stage fixtures and then the European Championship itself, matching France's achievement from 1984. Spain were also the first team since Germany in 1996 to win the tournament undefeated.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** \"UEFA National Team Ranking 2007\".

Each venue had a capacity of at least 30,000 for the tournament; the largest stadium was Ernst-Happel-Stadion in Vienna with a capacity of 53,295.[15] It was for this reason that Ernst-Happel-Stadion hosted the final. Switzerland played all three group stage matches at St. Jakob Park in Basel, which also hosted the opening match of the tournament as a compromise for the final being held in Vienna. Austria played all of their group stage matches at Ernst-Happel-Stadion.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 2012\n* 2016\n* 2020\n* 2024\n |\n| Overall records | * Team appearances\n* Player appearances\n* Goalscorers\n\t+ Hat-tricks\n\t+ Own goals\n* Penalty shoot-outs\n* Red cards\n* Winning players\n* Winning managers\n |\n| Miscellaneous | * Awards\n* Music\n* Mascots\n* Balls\n* Video games\n |\n| * † *Postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe*\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* ![](image) Category\n* ![](image) Commons\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying\n\nThe draw for the qualifying round took place in Montreux, Switzerland on 27 January 2006 at 12:00 CET.\n\n\nThe qualifying process commenced a month after the 2006 World Cup. Austria and Switzerland automatically qualified for the tournament finals as host nations.\n\n\nThe qualifying format was changed compared to previous tournaments. The winners and runners-up from seven groups automatically qualified for the Championship, with the hosts filling the other two slots in the 16-team tournament. The change means there were no play-offs between teams finishing in second place in the groups – they qualified directly for the finals. Teams that finished outside the top two positions in their groups failed to qualify. Group A contained eight teams, and the others contained seven.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n73. **^** Dean, Will (18 June 2012). \"Trending: The Euro 2012 chant that a Seven Nation Army couldn't hold back\". *The Independent*.

The qualifying tournament was contested by national teams from each of UEFA's member associations except Austria and Switzerland, who had automatically qualified for the final tournament as hosts, and Montenegro, who came into existence too late to be admitted to UEFA. England was the only seeded team not to qualify for the tournament proper, whereas Russia was the only unseeded one to qualify. The tournament also marked the debuts of Austria and Poland.\n\n\nThe draw for the final tournament took place on 2 December 2007, and saw Group C immediately labelled as the \"group of death\", with Italy, France, Romania and the Netherlands competing for the two qualifying places. In contrast, Germany and Portugal were deemed to have an easy draw, as the tournament structure meant they could not meet Italy, France, the Netherlands or Spain until the final.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSt. Jakob-Park, Basel\nAttendance: 39,730[27]\nReferee: Konrad Plautz (Austria)\n\n15 June 2008 (2008-06-15)\n20:45\n\n\n| Turkey ![](image) | 3–2 | ![](image) Czech Republic |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Turan ![](image) 75'\n* Nihat ![](image) 87', 89'\n | Report | * Koller ![](image) 34'\n* Plašil ![](image) 62'\n |\n\nStade de Genève, Geneva\nAttendance: 29,016[28]\nReferee: Peter Fröjdfeldt (Sweden)\n\n### Group B[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2008 Group B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Pos | Team* v\n* t\n* e\n | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts | Qualification\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image) Croatia | 3\n | 3\n | 0\n | 0\n | 4\n | 1\n | +3\n | 9\n | Advance to knockout phase |\n| 2\n | ![](image) Germany | 3\n | 2\n | 0\n | 1\n | 4\n | 2\n | +2\n | 6\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image) Austria (H) | 3\n | 0\n | 1\n | 2\n | 1\n | 3\n | −2\n | 1[a] |  |\n| 4\n | ![](image) Poland | 3\n | 0\n | 1\n | 2\n | 1\n | 4\n | −3\n | 1[a] |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSource: UEFA  \n(H) Hosts  \nNotes:\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Tied on head-to-head result (Austria 1–1 Poland).

The pot allocations were based on the 2003-edition of the UEFA national team coefficient ranking, which measured performance of teams in the 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifying and UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying. The coefficient was calculated by dividing the number of all points scored (three points for a win, one for a draw) by the number of all matches played. Results from the final tournaments, play-off matches and friendly games were all ignored.[38] As host country, Portugal were automatically placed in position A1, and would hereby play the opening match of the final tournament. The remaining 15 teams were split into four pots, with title-holders France seeded alongside Sweden and the Czech Republic in the first pot.[39][40]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEstádio Algarve, Faro/Loulé\nAttendance: 27,762\nReferee: Ľuboš Micheľ (Slovakia)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n27 June 2004 (2004-06-27)\n19:45\n\n\n| Czech Republic ![](image) | 3–0 | ![](image) Denmark |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Koller ![](image) 49'\n* Baroš ![](image) 63', 65'\n | Report |  |\n\nEstádio do Dragão, Porto\nAttendance: 41,092\nReferee: Valentin Ivanov (Russia)\n\n### Semi-finals[edit]\n\n\n30 June 2004 (2004-06-30)\n19:45\n\n\n| Portugal ![](image) | 2–1 | ![](image) Netherlands |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Ronaldo ![](image) 26'\n* Maniche ![](image) 58'\n | Report | * Andrade ![](image) 63' (o.g.)\n |\n\nEstádio José Alvalade, Lisbon\nAttendance: 46,679\nReferee: Anders Frisk (Sweden)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n1 July 2004 (2004-07-01)\n19:45\n\n\n| Greece ![](image) | 1–0 (a.e.t./s.g.) | ![](image) Czech Republic |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Dellas ![silver-colored soccer ball](image) 105+1'\n | Report |  |\n\nEstádio do Dragão, Porto\nAttendance: 42,449\nReferee: Pierluigi Collina (Italy)\n\n### Final[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2004 final\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFor the first time in an international football tournament, the silver goal system was applied, whereby the team that led the game at the half-time break during the extra time period would be declared the winner.[70] If the scores were still level after the initial 15 minutes of extra time, play would continue for a further 15 minutes.

Portugal recovered from an opening defeat against Greece to reach the final, eliminating England and the Netherlands along the way. For the first time in a major European football tournament, the last match featured the same teams as the opening match.[3] Portugal were again defeated by Greece with a goal from Angelos Charisteas.[4] Greece's triumph was unexpected, considering that they had only qualified for two other major tournaments: UEFA Euro 1980, at which they managed just one point, and the 1994 FIFA World Cup, where they lost all three matches. As winners, Greece earned the right to represent Europe at the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEuro 2004 marked the introduction of the penalty shoot-out as a tiebreaker between two teams in the group stage, although no match required the use of this procedure.

The pot allocations were based on the 2003-edition of the UEFA national team coefficient ranking, which measured performance of teams in the 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifying and UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying. The coefficient was calculated by dividing the number of all points scored (three points for a win, one for a draw) by the number of all matches played. Results from the final tournaments, play-off matches and friendly games were all ignored.[38] As host country, Portugal were automatically placed in position A1, and would hereby play the opening match of the final tournament. The remaining 15 teams were split into four pots, with title-holders France seeded alongside Sweden and the Czech Republic in the first pot.[39][40]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEstádio Algarve, Faro/Loulé\nAttendance: 27,762\nReferee: Ľuboš Micheľ (Slovakia)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n27 June 2004 (2004-06-27)\n19:45\n\n\n| Czech Republic ![](image) | 3–0 | ![](image) Denmark |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Koller ![](image) 49'\n* Baroš ![](image) 63', 65'\n | Report |  |\n\nEstádio do Dragão, Porto\nAttendance: 41,092\nReferee: Valentin Ivanov (Russia)\n\n### Semi-finals[edit]\n\n\n30 June 2004 (2004-06-30)\n19:45\n\n\n| Portugal ![](image) | 2–1 | ![](image) Netherlands |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Ronaldo ![](image) 26'\n* Maniche ![](image) 58'\n | Report | * Andrade ![](image) 63' (o.g.)\n |\n\nEstádio José Alvalade, Lisbon\nAttendance: 46,679\nReferee: Anders Frisk (Sweden)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n1 July 2004 (2004-07-01)\n19:45\n\n\n| Greece ![](image) | 1–0 (a.e.t./s.g.) | ![](image) Czech Republic |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Dellas ![silver-colored soccer ball](image) 105+1'\n | Report |  |\n\nEstádio do Dragão, Porto\nAttendance: 42,449\nReferee: Pierluigi Collina (Italy)\n\n### Final[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2004 final\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFor the first time in an international football tournament, the silver goal system was applied, whereby the team that led the game at the half-time break during the extra time period would be declared the winner.[70] If the scores were still level after the initial 15 minutes of extra time, play would continue for a further 15 minutes. If the teams could still not be separated after the extra time, there would be a penalty shoot-out (at least five penalties each) to determine which team progressed to the next round.[70] The silver goal replaced the golden goal from the previous two championships and was used in the semi-final between Greece and the Czech Republic.\n\n\nAs with every tournament since UEFA Euro 1984, there was no third place play-off.\n\n\n*All times are local, WEST (UTC+1).*\n\n\n\n### Bracket[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Team\n | Qualified as\n | Qualified on\n | Previous appearances in tournament[A] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Portugal | Host | 12 October 1999 | 3 (1984, 1996, 2000)\n |\n| ![](image) France | Group 1 winner | 10 September 2003 | 5 (*1960*, ***1984***, 1992, 1996, **2000**)\n |\n| ![](image) Czech Republic[B] | Group 3 winner | 10 September 2003 | 5 (1960, **1976**, 1980, 1996, 2000)\n |\n| ![](image) Sweden | Group 4 winner | 10 September 2003 | 2 (*1992*, 2000)\n |\n| ![](image) Bulgaria | Group 8 winner | 10 September 2003 | 1 (1996)\n |\n| ![](image) Denmark | Group 2 winner | 11 October 2003 | 6 (1964, 1984, 1988, **1992**, 1996, 2000)\n |\n| ![](image) Germany[C] | Group 5 winner | 11 October 2003 | 8 (**1972**, 1976, **1980**, 1984, *1988*, 1992, **1996**, 2000)\n |\n| ![](image) Greece | Group 6 winner | 11 October 2003 | 1 (1980)\n |\n| ![](image) England | Group 7 winner | 11 October 2003 | 6 (1968, 1980, 1988, 1992, *1996*, 2000)\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the two months ahead of the tournament, the Henri Delaunay Trophy travelled across Portugal to promote the European Championship finals in the host country.

Portugal recovered from an opening defeat against Greece to reach the final, eliminating England and the Netherlands along the way. For the first time in a major European football tournament, the last match featured the same teams as the opening match.[3] Portugal were again defeated by Greece with a goal from Angelos Charisteas.[4] Greece's triumph was unexpected, considering that they had only qualified for two other major tournaments: UEFA Euro 1980, at which they managed just one point, and the 1994 FIFA World Cup, where they lost all three matches. As winners, Greece earned the right to represent Europe at the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEuro 2004 marked the introduction of the penalty shoot-out as a tiebreaker between two teams in the group stage, although no match required the use of this procedure.

There were concerns that hooliganism would overshadow the finals. Many instances of violence occurred, including several football riots in Rotterdam between 1995 and 1999, which would host the Euro 2000 final. One of the most infamous incidents was the Battle of Beverwijk in 1997. Although the violence is normally associated with domestic clubs, there were concerns that it could attach to the Dutch national team.[10][11]\n\n\nViolence did eventually occur during the Euro 2000 finals, albeit not involving the Dutch team. On 17 June 174 England fans were arrested in Brussels, Belgium, following violence with Germans ahead of an England v Germany match.[12]\n\n\n\n## Summary[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_IsuG56ijH3FHRhInmdhwZTLe","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

There were concerns that hooliganism would overshadow the finals. Many instances of violence occurred, including several football riots in Rotterdam between 1995 and 1999, which would host the Euro 2000 final. One of the most infamous incidents was the Battle of Beverwijk in 1997. Although the violence is normally associated with domestic clubs, there were concerns that it could attach to the Dutch national team.[10][11]\n\n\nViolence did eventually occur during the Euro 2000 finals, albeit not involving the Dutch team. On 17 June 174 England fans were arrested in Brussels, Belgium, following violence with Germans ahead of an England v Germany match.[12]\n\n\n\n## Summary[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_IsuG56ijH3FHRhInmdhwZTLe","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

It was the first European Championship to feature 16 finalists, following UEFA's decision to expand the tournament from eight teams.\n\n\nMatches were staged in eight cities and, although not all games were sold out, the tournament holds the European Championship's second-highest aggregate attendance (1,276,000) and average per game (41,158) for the 16-team format,[1] surpassed only in 2012.[2]\n\n\nThe tournament was the first European Championship where three points were awarded for a win during the qualification and finals group stages, as opposed to the old system of two points for a win, reflecting the growing use of this system in domestic leagues throughout the world during the previous decade.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![UEFA Euro 1996 is located in England](image)![London](image)\nLondon\n![Manchester](image)\nManchester\n![Liverpool](image)\nLiverpool\n![Birmingham](image)\nBirmingham\n![Leeds](image)\nLeeds\n![Sheffield](image)\nSheffield\n![Nottingham](image)\nNottingham\n![Newcastle](image)\nNewcastle\n | London | Manchester |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Wembley Stadium | Old Trafford |\n| Capacity: **76,567** | Capacity: **55,000** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Liverpool | Birmingham |\n| Anfield | Villa Park |\n| Capacity: **42,730** | Capacity: **40,310** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Leeds | Sheffield | Nottingham | Newcastle |\n| Elland Road | Hillsborough | City Ground | St James' Park |\n| Capacity: **40,204** | Capacity: **39,859** | Capacity: **30,539** | Capacity: **36,649** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n\n\n## Squads[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 1996 squads\n\nEach national team had to submit a squad of 22 players, three of whom must be goalkeepers.\n\n\n\n## Finals format[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nGroup A\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| A1 | ![](image) England |\n| A2 | ![](image)  Switzerland |\n| A3 | ![](image) Netherlands |\n| A4 | ![](image) Scotland |\n| Wembley and Villa Park\n |\n\n | \n\nGroup B\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| B1 | ![](image) Spain |\n| B2 | ![](image) Bulgaria |\n| B3 | ![](image) Romania |\n| B4 | ![](image) France |\n| Elland Road and St James Park\n |\n\n | \n\nGroup C\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| C1 | ![](image) Germany |\n| C2 | ![](image) Czech Republic |\n| C3 | ![](image) Italy |\n| C4 | ![](image) Russia |\n| Old Trafford and Anfield\n |\n\n | \n\nGroup D\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| D1 | ![](image) Denmark |\n| D2 | ![](image) Portugal |\n| D3 | ![](image) Turkey |\n| D4 | ![](image) Croatia |\n| Hillsborough and City Ground\n |\n\n |\n\n\n## Venues[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Germany\n* Greece\n* Hungary\n* Iceland '95 '96\n* Israel\n* Italy\n* Latvia '95 '96\n* Liechtenstein\n* Lithuania\n* Luxembourg\n* Macedonia\n* Malta\n* Moldova\n* Netherlands\n* Northern Ireland\n* Norway '95 '96\n* Poland\n* Portugal\n* Republic of Ireland\n* Romania\n* Russia\n* San Marino\n* Scotland\n* Slovakia\n* Slovenia\n* Spain\n* Sweden\n* Switzerland\n* Turkey\n* Ukraine\n* Wales\n* FR Yugoslavia\n |\n| League cups | * England\n* Finland '95 '96\n* France\n* Iceland\n* Israel\n* Northern Ireland\n* Republic of Ireland\n* Scotland\n* Wales\n |\n| Supercups | * England\n* Germany\n |\n| UEFA competitions | * Champions League (Qualifying, group stage, knockout stage, Final)\n* Cup Winners' Cup (Final)\n* UEFA Cup (Final)\n* Intertoto Cup\n* Super Cup\n |\n\n| Authority control databases ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n |\n| --- |\n| International | * VIAF\n |\n| National | * Germany\n* Czech Republic\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### Qualified teams[edit]\n\n\nWith the extended format, three teams were able to qualify for their first European Championship: Bulgaria, Switzerland and Turkey. Croatia, the Czech Republic and Russia competed for the first time in their own right since the dissolution of Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union (though the Russian team is considered by FIFA to be the direct descendant of the Soviet Union and CIS teams that had appeared in six past tournaments and the Czech team is the descendant of the Czechoslovakia team). Seven of the eight participants at the previous tournament in 1992 were again present, with only Sweden – despite also having finished third in the World Cup two years earlier – missing out. Italy qualified after missing out Euro 1992 and Romania and Portugal after 12 years.\n\n\nAs of 2020, this was the last time that Sweden failed to qualify for the European Championship finals.\n\n\nThe following sixteen teams qualified for the finals:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n48. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"England fans riot after defeat\". *The Times*.

The qualifying process began in April 1994 and concluded in December 1995. At the conclusion of the qualifying group stage in November 1995, the eight group winners qualified automatically, along with the six highest-ranked second-placed teams. The remaining two second-placed teams, the Netherlands and the Republic of Ireland, contested a one-off play-off match in England to decide the final qualifier.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 2012\n* 2016\n* 2020\n* 2024\n |\n| Overall records | * Team appearances\n* Player appearances\n* Goalscorers\n\t+ Hat-tricks\n\t+ Own goals\n* Penalty shoot-outs\n* Red cards\n* Winning players\n* Winning managers\n |\n| Miscellaneous | * Awards\n* Music\n* Mascots\n* Balls\n* Video games\n |\n| * † *Postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe*\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* ![](image) Category\n* ![](image) Commons\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe hosting of the event was contested by five bids: Austria, England, Greece, the Netherlands and Portugal. The English bid was selected by the UEFA Executive Committee at a meeting in Lisbon on 5 May 1992.[5] In the year preceding the decision, the English FA had dropped plans to also bid for the 1998 World Cup in order to gain the support of other UEFA members who were planning to bid for that event.[5]\n\n\n\n## Summary[edit]\n\n\n### Group matches[edit]\n\n\nThe hosts, England, drew 1–1 with Switzerland in the opening match of Group A when Alan Shearer's 23rd-minute goal was cancelled out by a late Kubilay Türkyilmaz penalty kick.[6] England defeated rivals Scotland 2–0 in their next game, and then produced one of their finest performances ever with a 4–1 win over the Netherlands.[7] Patrick Kluivert's late goal for the Netherlands secured his team second place in the group and ensured that Scotland would exit another major competition on tie-breaking criteria.[8]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n31. **^** \"Lot Oranje last voor fans\" [Oranje draw burden for fans]. *De Stem* (in Dutch).

The large number of empty seats in most of the games not involving England was blamed on a number of factors: a lack of travelling fans from most of the other nations concerned, a lack of interest among locals for games not involving England, kick-offs before 5:00 pm that made it hard for children at school and adults at work to attend, steep ticket prices, and UEFA's policy of only selling tickets in blocks (where each block consisted of a set from each of three price bands).[47]\n\n\n\n### Disorder[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7.

The four groups (A to D) still contained four teams each, with the top two from each group still going through to the knockout phase. 8 teams then went into the new quarter-finals, ahead of the usual semi-finals and final, with 8 teams going out at the group stage. The format is exactly the one which was applied to the 1958, 1962, 1966 and 1970 World Cups, except for the absence of a third place play-off.\n\n\n\n## Match ball[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Adidas Questra\n\nA custom version of the Adidas Questra, the *Questra Europa*, was the official match ball of the championships. The design of the ball included a reworking of the England badge, and was the first coloured ball in a major football tournament.[32]\n\n\n\n## Match officials[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGermany won the tournament, beating the Czech Republic 2–1 in the final with a golden goal from Oliver Bierhoff during extra time; this was the first major competition to be decided using this method. This was also Germany's first major title won as a unified nation, adding to the two European Championship titles won by West Germany prior to reunification.\n\n\n\n\n## Bid process[edit]\n\n\nAt the time of the bidding process, it had not yet been confirmed that 16 teams would be participating. Instead, the bids were largely prepared as if hosting an eight-team tournament, meaning only four venues were due to be required.[3] All candidates had to submit their plans by 10 December 1991.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n1995–96 in European football (UEFA)\n |\n| --- |\n| Domestic leagues | * Albania\n* Andorra\n* Armenia\n* Austria\n* Azerbaijan\n* Belarus '95 '96\n* Belgium\n* Bosnia and Herzegovina (Herzeg-Bosnia, Republika Srpska)\n* Bulgaria\n* Croatia\n* Cyprus\n* Czech Republic\n* Denmark\n* England\n* Estonia\n* Faroe Islands '95 '96\n* Finland '95 '96\n* France\n* Georgia\n* Germany\n* Greece\n* Hungary\n* Iceland '95 '96\n* Israel\n* Italy\n* Kazakhstan '95 '96\n* Latvia '95 '96\n* Lithuania\n* Luxembourg\n* Macedonia\n* Malta\n* Moldova\n* Netherlands\n* Northern Ireland\n* Norway '95 '96\n* Poland\n* Portugal\n* Republic of Ireland\n* Romania\n* Russia '95 '96\n* San Marino\n* Scotland\n* Slovakia\n* Slovenia\n* Spain\n* Sweden '95 '96\n* Switzerland\n* Turkey\n* Ukraine\n* Wales\n* FR Yugoslavia\n |\n| Domestic cups | * Albania\n* Andorra\n* Armenia\n* Austria\n* Azerbaijan\n* Belarus\n* Belgium\n* Bosnia and Herzegovina\n* Bulgaria\n* Croatia\n* Cyprus\n* Czech Republic\n* Denmark\n* England\n* Estonia\n* Faroe Islands '95 '96\n* Finland '95 '96\n* France\n* Georgia\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| France ![](image) | 0–0 (a.e.t.) | ![](image) Netherlands |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report |  |\n| Penalties |\n| * Zidane ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Djorkaeff ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Lizarazu ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Guérin ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Blanc ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n | 5–4 | * ![soccer ball with check mark](image) De Kock\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) De Boer\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Kluivert\n* ![soccer ball with red X](image) Seedorf\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Blind\n |\n\nAnfield, Liverpool\nAttendance: 37,465[19]\nReferee: Antonio López Nieto (Spain)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n23 June 1996 (1996-06-23)\n15:00\n\n\n| Germany ![](image) | 2–1 | ![](image) Croatia |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Klinsmann ![](image) 20' (pen.)\n* Sammer ![](image) 59'\n | Report | * Šuker ![](image) 51'\n |\n\nOld Trafford, Manchester\nAttendance: 43,412[20]\nReferee: Leif Sundell (Sweden)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n23 June 1996 (1996-06-23)\n18:30\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA terrorist attack took place in Manchester on 15 June, one day before the group stage match between Germany and Russia was due to take place in the same city.[45] The detonation of a van bomb in the city centre injured 212 people and caused an estimated £700 million worth of damage. Four days after the blast, the Provisional Irish Republican Army issued a statement in which it claimed responsibility, but regretted causing injury to civilians.[46]\n\n\nThe Manchester bombing was the first and so far only major terrorist attack in the host city of an ongoing UEFA European Championship. The scheduled match at Old Trafford on the day following the bombing went ahead as planned after the stadium had been heavily guarded overnight and carefully searched; the game, in which Germany defeated Russia 3–0, was watched by a near capacity crowd of 50,700.\n\n\n\n### Empty seats[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter England's defeat to Germany in the semi-finals, a large-scale riot took place in Trafalgar Square and the surrounding area. Further outbreaks of trouble occurred in the streets of several other towns. The police and German-made cars were targeted, with damage also caused to various other properties.[48] A Russian student was stabbed in Brighton after attackers mistook him for being German.[49]\n\n\nDespite this outbreak, the tournament overall was free of hooliganism, helping rehabilitate England's reputation after their fans' conduct during the previous decades.[48] UEFA's awarding of the tournament to England was in itself a further step in bringing the country back fully into the international fold, coming soon after their decision in 1990 to re-admit English clubs back into UEFA competitions after the indefinite ban issued to them following the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985.[50][51]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. **^** Shaw, Phil (17 June 1996). \"Euro '96: Suker sinks Denmark\". *The Independent*.

Croatia, the Czech Republic and Russia competed for the first time in their own right since the dissolution of Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union (though the Russian team is considered by FIFA to be the direct descendant of the Soviet Union and CIS teams that had appeared in six past tournaments and the Czech team is the descendant of the Czechoslovakia team). Seven of the eight participants at the previous tournament in 1992 were again present, with only Sweden – despite also having finished third in the World Cup two years earlier – missing out. Italy qualified after missing out Euro 1992 and Romania and Portugal after 12 years.\n\n\nAs of 2020, this was the last time that Sweden failed to qualify for the European Championship finals.\n\n\nThe following sixteen teams qualified for the finals:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n48. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"England fans riot after defeat\". *The Times*.

The qualifying process began in April 1994 and concluded in December 1995. At the conclusion of the qualifying group stage in November 1995, the eight group winners qualified automatically, along with the six highest-ranked second-placed teams. The remaining two second-placed teams, the Netherlands and the Republic of Ireland, contested a one-off play-off match in England to decide the final qualifier.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 2012\n* 2016\n* 2020\n* 2024\n |\n| Overall records | * Team appearances\n* Player appearances\n* Goalscorers\n\t+ Hat-tricks\n\t+ Own goals\n* Penalty shoot-outs\n* Red cards\n* Winning players\n* Winning managers\n |\n| Miscellaneous | * Awards\n* Music\n* Mascots\n* Balls\n* Video games\n |\n| * † *Postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe*\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* ![](image) Category\n* ![](image) Commons\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe hosting of the event was contested by five bids: Austria, England, Greece, the Netherlands and Portugal. The English bid was selected by the UEFA Executive Committee at a meeting in Lisbon on 5 May 1992.[5] In the year preceding the decision, the English FA had dropped plans to also bid for the 1998 World Cup in order to gain the support of other UEFA members who were planning to bid for that event.[5]\n\n\n\n## Summary[edit]\n\n\n### Group matches[edit]\n\n\nThe hosts, England, drew 1–1 with Switzerland in the opening match of Group A when Alan Shearer's 23rd-minute goal was cancelled out by a late Kubilay Türkyilmaz penalty kick.[6] England defeated rivals Scotland 2–0 in their next game, and then produced one of their finest performances ever with a 4–1 win over the Netherlands.[7] Patrick Kluivert's late goal for the Netherlands secured his team second place in the group and ensured that Scotland would exit another major competition on tie-breaking criteria.[8]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n31. **^** \"Lot Oranje last voor fans\" [Oranje draw burden for fans]. *De Stem* (in Dutch).

The large number of empty seats in most of the games not involving England was blamed on a number of factors: a lack of travelling fans from most of the other nations concerned, a lack of interest among locals for games not involving England, kick-offs before 5:00 pm that made it hard for children at school and adults at work to attend, steep ticket prices, and UEFA's policy of only selling tickets in blocks (where each block consisted of a set from each of three price bands).[47]\n\n\n\n### Disorder[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7.

The four groups (A to D) still contained four teams each, with the top two from each group still going through to the knockout phase. 8 teams then went into the new quarter-finals, ahead of the usual semi-finals and final, with 8 teams going out at the group stage. The format is exactly the one which was applied to the 1958, 1962, 1966 and 1970 World Cups, except for the absence of a third place play-off.\n\n\n\n## Match ball[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Adidas Questra\n\nA custom version of the Adidas Questra, the *Questra Europa*, was the official match ball of the championships. The design of the ball included a reworking of the England badge, and was the first coloured ball in a major football tournament.[32]\n\n\n\n## Match officials[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGermany won the tournament, beating the Czech Republic 2–1 in the final with a golden goal from Oliver Bierhoff during extra time; this was the first major competition to be decided using this method. This was also Germany's first major title won as a unified nation, adding to the two European Championship titles won by West Germany prior to reunification.\n\n\n\n\n## Bid process[edit]\n\n\nAt the time of the bidding process, it had not yet been confirmed that 16 teams would be participating. Instead, the bids were largely prepared as if hosting an eight-team tournament, meaning only four venues were due to be required.[3] All candidates had to submit their plans by 10 December 1991.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n1995–96 in European football (UEFA)\n |\n| --- |\n| Domestic leagues | * Albania\n* Andorra\n* Armenia\n* Austria\n* Azerbaijan\n* Belarus '95 '96\n* Belgium\n* Bosnia and Herzegovina (Herzeg-Bosnia, Republika Srpska)\n* Bulgaria\n* Croatia\n* Cyprus\n* Czech Republic\n* Denmark\n* England\n* Estonia\n* Faroe Islands '95 '96\n* Finland '95 '96\n* France\n* Georgia\n* Germany\n* Greece\n* Hungary\n* Iceland '95 '96\n* Israel\n* Italy\n* Kazakhstan '95 '96\n* Latvia '95 '96\n* Lithuania\n* Luxembourg\n* Macedonia\n* Malta\n* Moldova\n* Netherlands\n* Northern Ireland\n* Norway '95 '96\n* Poland\n* Portugal\n* Republic of Ireland\n* Romania\n* Russia '95 '96\n* San Marino\n* Scotland\n* Slovakia\n* Slovenia\n* Spain\n* Sweden '95 '96\n* Switzerland\n* Turkey\n* Ukraine\n* Wales\n* FR Yugoslavia\n |\n| Domestic cups | * Albania\n* Andorra\n* Armenia\n* Austria\n* Azerbaijan\n* Belarus\n* Belgium\n* Bosnia and Herzegovina\n* Bulgaria\n* Croatia\n* Cyprus\n* Czech Republic\n* Denmark\n* England\n* Estonia\n* Faroe Islands '95 '96\n* Finland '95 '96\n* France\n* Georgia\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| France ![](image) | 0–0 (a.e.t.) | ![](image) Netherlands |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report |  |\n| Penalties |\n| * Zidane ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Djorkaeff ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Lizarazu ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Guérin ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Blanc ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n | 5–4 | * ![soccer ball with check mark](image) De Kock\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) De Boer\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Kluivert\n* ![soccer ball with red X](image) Seedorf\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Blind\n |\n\nAnfield, Liverpool\nAttendance: 37,465[19]\nReferee: Antonio López Nieto (Spain)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n23 June 1996 (1996-06-23)\n15:00\n\n\n| Germany ![](image) | 2–1 | ![](image) Croatia |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Klinsmann ![](image) 20' (pen.)\n* Sammer ![](image) 59'\n | Report | * Šuker ![](image) 51'\n |\n\nOld Trafford, Manchester\nAttendance: 43,412[20]\nReferee: Leif Sundell (Sweden)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n23 June 1996 (1996-06-23)\n18:30\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA terrorist attack took place in Manchester on 15 June, one day before the group stage match between Germany and Russia was due to take place in the same city.[45] The detonation of a van bomb in the city centre injured 212 people and caused an estimated £700 million worth of damage. Four days after the blast, the Provisional Irish Republican Army issued a statement in which it claimed responsibility, but regretted causing injury to civilians.[46]\n\n\nThe Manchester bombing was the first and so far only major terrorist attack in the host city of an ongoing UEFA European Championship. The scheduled match at Old Trafford on the day following the bombing went ahead as planned after the stadium had been heavily guarded overnight and carefully searched; the game, in which Germany defeated Russia 3–0, was watched by a near capacity crowd of 50,700.\n\n\n\n### Empty seats[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter England's defeat to Germany in the semi-finals, a large-scale riot took place in Trafalgar Square and the surrounding area. Further outbreaks of trouble occurred in the streets of several other towns. The police and German-made cars were targeted, with damage also caused to various other properties.[48] A Russian student was stabbed in Brighton after attackers mistook him for being German.[49]\n\n\nDespite this outbreak, the tournament overall was free of hooliganism, helping rehabilitate England's reputation after their fans' conduct during the previous decades.[48] UEFA's awarding of the tournament to England was in itself a further step in bringing the country back fully into the international fold, coming soon after their decision in 1990 to re-admit English clubs back into UEFA competitions after the indefinite ban issued to them following the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985.[50][51]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. **^** Shaw, Phil (17 June 1996). \"Euro '96: Suker sinks Denmark\". *The Independent*.

It was also the first major tournament in which the reunified Germany (who were beaten 2–0 by Denmark in the final) had competed.\n\n\nIt was the last tournament with only eight participants, to award the winner of a match with only two points, and before the introduction of the back-pass rule, the latter of which was brought in immediately after the tournament was completed. When the next competition was held in 1996, 16 teams were involved and were awarded three points for a win.\n\n\n\n\n## Bid process[edit]\n\n\nOn 16 December 1988, following a decision made by the UEFA Executive Committee, Sweden was chosen over Spain to host the event.[2] Spain was at a disadvantage as they had already been chosen to host the EXPO 1992 in Seville and the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona.[2][3]\n\n\n\n## Summary[edit]\n\n\nSeven of the eight teams had to qualify for the final stage; Sweden qualified automatically as hosts of the event.[4] The Soviet Union qualified for the final tournament shortly before the break-up of the country, and took part in the tournament under the banner of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS),[5] before the former Soviet republics formed their own national teams after the competition. The CIS team represented the following former Soviet nations: Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Moldova, and Tajikistan. Four out of 15 ex-republics were not members of the CIS: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania did not send their players; Georgia was not a member of the CIS at the time, but Georgian Kakhaber Tskhadadze was a part of the squad.\n\n\nOriginally, Yugoslavia qualified for the final stage and were about to participate as FR Yugoslavia, but due to the Yugoslav Wars, the team was disqualified and Denmark, as the runners-up from Yugoslavia's qualifying group, was invited to take part instead.[6] After a draw with England and a loss to host nation Sweden, Denmark beat France in their final group match to qualify for the semi-finals, where they would face the reigning European champions, the Netherlands. Denmark led 2–1 going into the last five minutes, but a Frank Rijkaard equaliser meant the game went to a penalty shoot-out; Danish goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel saved Marco van Basten's kick, giving Denmark a 5–4 win on penalties and a place in the final against reigning world champions Germany.[7] Denmark won the final 2–0 with goals from John Jensen and Kim Vilfort in either half to claim their first European title.[8]\n\n\n\n## Qualification[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 1992 qualifying\n\nScotland and the hosts Sweden made their respective debuts despite having already made many appearances at the World Cup. France qualified for the first Euro in which they were not the hosts. They played after missing the previous tournament.\n\n\nAs of 2020, this was the last time the Czech Republic (then Czechoslovakia), Italy, Portugal and Spain failed to qualify for the European Championship finals.\n\n\n\n### Qualified teams[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Team\n | Qualified as\n | Qualified on\n | Previous appearances in tournament[A] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Sweden | Host | 16 December 1988 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) France | Group 1 winner | 12 October 1991 | 2 (*1960*, ***1984***)\n |\n| ![](image) England | Group 7 winner | 13 November 1991 | 3 (1968, 1980, 1988)\n |\n| ![](image) CIS[B] | Group 3 winner[C] | 13 November 1991 | 5 (**1960**, 1964, 1968, 1972, 1988)\n |\n| ![](image) Scotland | Group 2 winner | 13 November 1991 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) Germany[D] | Group 5 winner | 20 November 1991 | 5 (**1972**, 1976, **1980**, 1984, *1988*)\n |\n| ![](image) Netherlands | Group 6 winner | 4 December 1991 | 3 (1976, 1980, **1988**)\n |\n| ![](image) Denmark | Group 4 runner-up[E] | 31 May 1992 | 3 (1964, 1984, 1988)\n |\n\n\n1. **^** **Bold** indicates champion for that year. *Italic* indicates host for that year.\n2. **^** From 1960 to 1988, CIS competed as the Soviet Union.\n3. **^** Replaced the Soviet Union.\n4. **^** From 1972 to 1988, Germany competed as West Germany.\n5. **^** Replaced FR Yugoslavia (after qualifying as Yugoslavia), who were subject to sanctions under UN Security Council Resolution 757 and thus banned from appearing.[9]\n\n### Final draw[edit]\n\n\nThe draw for the final tournament took place on 17 January 1992 in Gothenburg. Only two teams were seeded: Sweden (as hosts) and the Netherlands (as holders).[10][11] The remaining six teams were all unseeded and could be drawn in any group. Months after the draw, Yugoslavia was banned from participating and replaced by Denmark, which had come second in the qualifying group.\n\n\nIn the draw procedure, the unseeded teams were drawn one by one. The first two were placed in position 4 of each group, the next two in position 3, and the last 2 in position 2. The two seeded teams were then drawn and placed consecutively into position 1 of the groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Pot 1: Seeded teams\n | Pot 2: Unseeded teams\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| * ![](image) Sweden (hosts)[a]\n* ![](image) Netherlands (holders)[b]\n | * ![](image) CIS\n* ![](image) England\n | * ![](image) France\n* ![](image) Germany\n | * ![](image) Scotland\n* ~~![](image) Yugoslavia~~[c]\n |\n\n\n1. **^** Hosts Sweden were automatically assigned to position A1.\n2. **^** Defending champions the Netherlands were automatically assigned to position B1.\n3. **^** Yugoslavia were to participate in the final tournament as FR Yugoslavia. However, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was placed under sanctions on 30 May 1992 by the United Nations Security Council Resolution 757 after the outbreak of Yugoslav Wars.[9] FIFA and UEFA therefore suspended FR Yugoslavia from competitive football on 31 May 1992, meaning they could not participate in the final tournament. Denmark instead took the spot at the final tournament.\n\nThe draw resulted in the following groups:[12]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\nGroup A\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| A1 | ![](image) Sweden |\n| A2 | ![](image) France |\n| A3 | ~~![](image) Yugoslavia~~ → ![](image) Denmark |\n| A4 | ![](image) England |\n\n | \n\nGroup B\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| B1 | ![](image) Netherlands |\n| B2 | ![](image) Scotland |\n| B3 | ![](image) CIS |\n| B4 | ![](image) Germany |\n\n |\n\n\n## Venues[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Gothenburg | ![UEFA Euro 1992 is located in Sweden](image)![Gothenburg](image)\nGothenburg\n![Stockholm](image)\nStockholm\n![Malmö](image)\nMalmö\n![Norrköping](image)\nNorrköping\n | Stockholm |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Ullevi | Råsunda Stadium |\n| Capacity: **44,000** | Capacity: **40,000** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Malmö | Norrköping |\n| Malmö Stadion | Idrottsparken |\n| Capacity: **30,000** | Capacity: **23,000** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) |\n\n\n## Squads[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 1992 squads\n\nEach national team had to submit a squad of 20 players.\n\n\n\n## Match ball[edit]\n\n\nAdidas Etrusco Unico was used as the official match ball of the tournament.

It was the ninth UEFA European Championship, which is held every four years and supported by UEFA.\n\n\nDenmark won the 1992 championship, having qualified only after Yugoslavia was disqualified as a result of the breakup of the country and the ensuing warfare there. Eight national teams contested the final tournament.[1]\n\n\nThe CIS national football team (Commonwealth of Independent States), representing the recently dissolved Soviet Union, whose national team had qualified for the tournament, were present at the tournament. It was also the first major tournament in which the reunified Germany (who were beaten 2–0 by Denmark in the final) had competed.\n\n\nIt was the last tournament with only eight participants, to award the winner of a match with only two points, and before the introduction of the back-pass rule, the latter of which was brought in immediately after the tournament was completed. When the next competition was held in 1996, 16 teams were involved and were awarded three points for a win.\n\n\n\n\n## Bid process[edit]\n\n\nOn 16 December 1988, following a decision made by the UEFA Executive Committee, Sweden was chosen over Spain to host the event.[2] Spain was at a disadvantage as they had already been chosen to host the EXPO 1992 in Seville and the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona.[2][3]\n\n\n\n## Summary[edit]\n\n\nSeven of the eight teams had to qualify for the final stage; Sweden qualified automatically as hosts of the event.[4] The Soviet Union qualified for the final tournament shortly before the break-up of the country, and took part in the tournament under the banner of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS),[5] before the former Soviet republics formed their own national teams after the competition. The CIS team represented the following former Soviet nations: Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Moldova, and Tajikistan. Four out of 15 ex-republics were not members of the CIS: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania did not send their players; Georgia was not a member of the CIS at the time, but Georgian Kakhaber Tskhadadze was a part of the squad.\n\n\nOriginally, Yugoslavia qualified for the final stage and were about to participate as FR Yugoslavia, but due to the Yugoslav Wars, the team was disqualified and Denmark, as the runners-up from Yugoslavia's qualifying group, was invited to take part instead.[6] After a draw with England and a loss to host nation Sweden, Denmark beat France in their final group match to qualify for the semi-finals, where they would face the reigning European champions, the Netherlands. Denmark led 2–1 going into the last five minutes, but a Frank Rijkaard equaliser meant the game went to a penalty shoot-out; Danish goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel saved Marco van Basten's kick, giving Denmark a 5–4 win on penalties and a place in the final against reigning world champions Germany.[7] Denmark won the final 2–0 with goals from John Jensen and Kim Vilfort in either half to claim their first European title.[8]\n\n\n\n## Qualification[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 1992 qualifying\n\nScotland and the hosts Sweden made their respective debuts despite having already made many appearances at the World Cup. France qualified for the first Euro in which they were not the hosts. They played after missing the previous tournament.\n\n\nAs of 2020, this was the last time the Czech Republic (then Czechoslovakia), Italy, Portugal and Spain failed to qualify for the European Championship finals.\n\n\n\n### Qualified teams[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Team\n | Qualified as\n | Qualified on\n | Previous appearances in tournament[A] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Sweden | Host | 16 December 1988 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) France | Group 1 winner | 12 October 1991 | 2 (*1960*, ***1984***)\n |\n| ![](image) England | Group 7 winner | 13 November 1991 | 3 (1968, 1980, 1988)\n |\n| ![](image) CIS[B] | Group 3 winner[C] | 13 November 1991 | 5 (**1960**, 1964, 1968, 1972, 1988)\n |\n| ![](image) Scotland | Group 2 winner | 13 November 1991 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) Germany[D] | Group 5 winner | 20 November 1991 | 5 (**1972**, 1976, **1980**, 1984, *1988*)\n |\n| ![](image) Netherlands | Group 6 winner | 4 December 1991 | 3 (1976, 1980, **1988**)\n |\n| ![](image) Denmark | Group 4 runner-up[E] | 31 May 1992 | 3 (1964, 1984, 1988)\n |\n\n\n1. **^** **Bold** indicates champion for that year. *Italic* indicates host for that year.\n2. **^** From 1960 to 1988, CIS competed as the Soviet Union.\n3. **^** Replaced the Soviet Union.\n4. **^** From 1972 to 1988, Germany competed as West Germany.\n5. **^** Replaced FR Yugoslavia (after qualifying as Yugoslavia), who were subject to sanctions under UN Security Council Resolution 757 and thus banned from appearing.[9]\n\n### Final draw[edit]\n\n\nThe draw for the final tournament took place on 17 January 1992 in Gothenburg. Only two teams were seeded: Sweden (as hosts) and the Netherlands (as holders).[10][11] The remaining six teams were all unseeded and could be drawn in any group. Months after the draw, Yugoslavia was banned from participating and replaced by Denmark, which had come second in the qualifying group.\n\n\nIn the draw procedure, the unseeded teams were drawn one by one. The first two were placed in position 4 of each group, the next two in position 3, and the last 2 in position 2. The two seeded teams were then drawn and placed consecutively into position 1 of the groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Pot 1: Seeded teams\n | Pot 2: Unseeded teams\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| * ![](image) Sweden (hosts)[a]\n* ![](image) Netherlands (holders)[b]\n | * ![](image) CIS\n* ![](image) England\n | * ![](image) France\n* ![](image) Germany\n | * ![](image) Scotland\n* ~~![](image) Yugoslavia~~[c]\n |\n\n\n1. **^** Hosts Sweden were automatically assigned to position A1.\n2. **^** Defending champions the Netherlands were automatically assigned to position B1.\n3. **^** Yugoslavia were to participate in the final tournament as FR Yugoslavia. However, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was placed under sanctions on 30 May 1992 by the United Nations Security Council Resolution 757 after the outbreak of Yugoslav Wars.[9] FIFA and UEFA therefore suspended FR Yugoslavia from competitive football on 31 May 1992, meaning they could not participate in the final tournament. Denmark instead took the spot at the final tournament.\n\nThe draw resulted in the following groups:[12]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\nGroup A\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| A1 | ![](image) Sweden |\n| A2 | ![](image) France |\n| A3 | ~~![](image) Yugoslavia~~ → ![](image) Denmark |\n| A4 | ![](image) England |\n\n | \n\nGroup B\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| B1 | ![](image) Netherlands |\n| B2 | ![](image) Scotland |\n| B3 | ![](image) CIS |\n| B4 | ![](image) Germany |\n\n |\n\n\n## Venues[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Gothenburg | ![UEFA Euro 1992 is located in Sweden](image)![Gothenburg](image)\nGothenburg\n![Stockholm](image)\nStockholm\n![Malmö](image)\nMalmö\n![Norrköping](image)\nNorrköping\n | Stockholm |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Ullevi | Råsunda Stadium |\n| Capacity: **44,000** | Capacity: **40,000** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Malmö | Norrköping |\n| Malmö Stadion | Idrottsparken |\n| Capacity: **30,000** | Capacity: **23,000** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) |\n\n\n## Squads[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 1992 squads\n\nEach national team had to submit a squad of 20 players.\n\n\n\n## Match ball[edit]\n\n\nAdidas Etrusco Unico was used as the official match ball of the tournament.

It was the eighth UEFA European Championship, which is held every four years and supported by UEFA.\n\n\nFrance were the defending champions, but failed to qualify. \n\n\nThe tournament crowned the Netherlands as European champions for the first time. Euro 88 was a rare instance of a major football tournament ending without a single sending-off or goalless draw, nor any knockout matches going to extra time or penalties. Euro 1988 was the final European Championship to see teams from West Germany and the Soviet Union, as the West and East Germans reunified to become Germany in 1990, and the Soviet Union disintegrated into 15 separate countries in 1991.\n\n\n\n\n## Bid process[edit]\n\n\nWest Germany won the right to host the tournament with five votes ahead of a joint bid from Norway, Sweden and Denmark, which earned one vote, and a bid from England.[1]\n\n\nBecause the Eastern Bloc disagreed that West Berlin was part of the Federal Republic of Germany, the German Football Association ruled out playing Championship matches in West Berlin. This secured the participation of Eastern European members of UEFA.[*citation needed*] In the 1974 FIFA World Cup, however, West Berlin had hosted three games.\n\n\nAs a compromise, Berlin Olympic Stadium did host a Four Nations Tournament in 1988, with West Germany playing against the Soviet Union, Argentina and Sweden.[2]\n\n\n\n## Overview[edit]\n\n\n### Group matches[edit]\n\n\nThe first group pitted two pre-tournament favourites West Germany and Italy together, along with Spain and Denmark. The West German team had won the 1980 European Championship and were the runners-up in each of the last two World Cups in 1982 and 1986, although in 1984 they failed to qualify from their group. With such results and additionally as the host they were commonly considered the main favourite of the tournament.\n\n\nThe Italians had not played at Euro 1984, though they had finished fourth in the 1980 tournament, for which they were the hosts; they had also won the 1982 World Cup, albeit followed by a middling performance in 1986. Spain and Denmark contested the second semi-final of the 1984 edition, in which Spain prevailed on penalty-kicks, but then lost the final to hosts, France (who failed to qualify in 1988). Both Spain and Denmark played in the 1986 World Cup, and met there again, in a Round of 16 match of the knockout stage which Spain won 5–1.\n\n\nThe Germans and Italians played out the opening game. This game was tightly contested. Roberto Mancini capitalised on a defensive error on the left-hand side of the German goal and the striker squeezed in a shot from a tight angle low to the left corner. Just three minutes later, Italy's goalkeeper, Walter Zenga was penalised for taking more than four steps with the ball and Andreas Brehme scored the resulting free-kick from the edge of the penalty area with a low shot to the right corner. Both teams settled for a 1–1 draw.\n\n\nSpain defeated Denmark again, this time 3–2. Míchel opened the scoring after five minutes with a shot to the left corner from inside the penalty area and Michael Laudrup equalised 20 minutes later with a left foot shot from the edge of the penalty area to the left corner. Spain dominated the next hour and Emilio Butragueño scored with a low shot through the goalkeepers legs and then Rafael Gordillo putting the Spanish 3–1 to the good with a free-kick which deceived the goalkeeper. A late surge saw Flemming Povlsen reduce the scoreline with a header in off the left post, but was not enough for the Danes, who now needed to win both their remaining games to be certain of a place in the semi-finals.\n\n\nIn the remaining games the West Germans swept aside the Danes and Spanish. Jürgen Klinsmann and Olaf Thon scored to dispatch the former 2–0 while two goals from Rudi Völler were enough to beat Spain 2–0. The second goal was particularly notable. Lothar Matthäus ran 40 yards into the Spanish penalty box before back-heeling the ball for the oncoming Völler, following up his run, to strike the ball with the outside of his foot and into the corner of the goal.\n\n\nThe Italians won a difficult match against the Spanish 1–0, courtesy of a goal from Gianluca Vialli, a low cross-shot to the net on 73 minutes. In the last game, against an already eliminated Denmark, the Italians prevailed 2–0.\n\n\nThe second group witnessed a surprising set of results. In the opening game, one of the pre-tournament favourites England lost 1–0 to Ireland. Ray Houghton scored a looping header after six minutes after the English defence failed to clear a cross. The English applied strong pressure as the game wore on. Gary Lineker was unusually sluggish, missing a series of chances and hitting the crossbar – he was later diagnosed with hepatitis B.[3] In the other opening game, the Soviet Union defeated the Netherlands 1–0 through a Vasyl Rats goal, despite the Dutch dominating for long periods.\n\n\nEngland met the Netherlands in Düsseldorf; both needed to win. England started strongly with Lineker hitting a post and Glenn Hoddle striking the post with a free-kick. The English defence, weakened by the absence of Terry Butcher, conceded the first of three goals to Marco van Basten on 44 minutes. Van Basten turned Butcher's replacement Tony Adams and beat Peter Shilton – playing his 100th game for England – to give his side a 1–0 lead. England rallied after the break. Lineker and Bryan Robson exchanged a kick one-two pass allowing Robson to burst into the box and lift the ball over Hans van Breukelen after 53 minutes. The score remained until Van Basten turned Tony Adams inside out to finish from 18 yards on 71 minutes. The striker pounced from close-range after a corner to seal a 3–1 win four minutes later.\n\n\nThe Irish and Soviets led the group after two games through a 1–1 draw in Hanover. Ronnie Whelan scored a spectacular left-foot volley from 18 yards to put the Irish into the lead. Oleh Protasov equalised with a low shot as the Soviets exerted late pressure.\n\n\nNeeding to defeat the Irish to progress, the Dutch won the game 1–0 through a late Wim Kieft goal. The ball deflected into his path and he delivered a looping header which spun into the right corner of the Irish net with nine minutes remaining just after Paul McGrath hit a Dutch post with a header. In the other game, the Soviets soundly thrashed England. A mistake from Hoddle allowed Sergei Aleinikov to score after three minutes. Adams equalised and England had chances to go ahead, but a goal before half-time and late in the game assured the Soviet Union would finish in first place in the group.[4]\n\n\n\n### Semi-finals and final[edit]\n\n\nThe first semi-final was significant as rivals West Germany played the Netherlands. It was only the third time the two sides had faced each other since the 1974 FIFA World Cup Final; the West Germans winning a first round match in the 1980 European Championship, and a 2–2 draw in a 1978 FIFA World Cup second round group match. The game was tight, and the West Germans broke the deadlock on 55 minutes with a Matthäus penalty after a foul on Klinsmann. The lead was held for 20 minutes until Jürgen Kohler brought down Van Basten. Ronald Koeman converted the spot-kick to level the match. With the match headed for extra time, a through ball caught the Germans out and Van Basten finished clinically with a shot as he slid along the floor, beating the goalkeeper and Kohler to the ball in the 88th minute for a 2–1 win. It gave the Dutch their first competitive victory against the Germans and the first appearance in the competition's final. The victory was marred by the reaction of Dutch defender Koeman who wiped the shirt of Olaf Thon, given to him after the match, on his backside in front of the German fans. The player apologised afterwards.\n\n\nThe other semi-final was another unpredictable result. Italy were strong favourites to reach the final and had beaten the Soviets 4–1 in a friendly just two months earlier. Despite controlling the play and having the majority of the chances, the Italians were undone by poor finishing and a strong, tough opposition who sought to stop their more skilful opponents from playing through hard tackles and a defensive strategy. The hard work-rate of the Soviets paid off and in just four second-half minutes, counter-attacks saw two goals from Hennadiy Lytovchenko and Oleg Protasov. The first one from Lytovchenko was initially blocked, but with quick reactions he beat Franco Baresi to the ball to fire the second shot into the far corner. The second from Protasov was a looping shot that floated over Zenga for a 2–0 victory. It would be the Soviet Union's fourth appearance in a European Championship final.\n\n\nThe final was played on 25 June between the Soviet Union, in what would turn out to be the nation's last European Championship match, and the Netherlands at the Olympiastadion in Munich. The Dutch won the match 2–0, with goals by captain Ruud Gullit and tournament top scorer Marco van Basten. Hans van Breukelen blocked a low penalty shot of Igor Belanov. Van Basten's goal, a sharply hit volley across the goal off an incoming looping pass, would later be described as one of the greatest goals in the history of the European Championships.[5][6]\n\n\n\n## Qualification[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 1988 qualifying\n\n### Qualified teams[edit]\n\n\nSeven countries had to qualify for the final stage. West Germany qualified automatically as hosts of the event. The Republic of Ireland qualified for the first time for any major tournament. The holders, France, failed to qualify despite finishing third in the 1986 World Cup. As of 2024, this is the last time that France failed to qualify for the European Championship finals, and since the conversion to a group stage in the finals tournament, this remains the only time the previous tournament winners failed to qualify for the next competition.[7] Other notable absentees were Belgium (the 1980 runners-up and 1986 FIFA World Cup semi-finalists) and Portugal (semi-finalists of Euro 1984). The following eight teams qualified for the final tournament:\n\n\n\n\n\n| Team\n | Qualified as\n | Qualified on\n | Previous appearances  in tournament[A] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) West Germany | Host | 14 March 1985 | 4 (**1972**, 1976, **1980**, 1984)\n |\n| ![](image) Denmark | Group 6 winner | 14 October 1987 | 2 (1964, 1984)\n |\n| ![](image) Soviet Union | Group 3 winner | 28 October 1987 | 4 (**1960**, 1964, 1968, 1972)\n |\n| ![](image) England | Group 4 winner | 11 November 1987 | 2 (1968, 1980)\n |\n| ![](image) Republic of Ireland | Group 7 winner | 11 November 1987 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) Italy | Group 2 winner | 14 November 1987 | 2 (***1968***, *1980*)\n |\n| ![](image) Spain | Group 1 winner | 18 November 1987 | 3 (***1964***, 1980, 1984)\n |\n| ![](image) Netherlands | Group 5 winner | 9 December 1987 | 2 (1976, 1980)\n |\n\n\n1. **^** **Bold** indicates champion for that year. *Italic* indicates host for that year.\n\n## Venues[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| ![UEFA Euro 1988 is located in FRG and West Berlin](image)![Munich](image)\nMunich\n![Gelsenkirchen](image)\nGelsenkirchen\n![Hamburg](image)\nHamburg\n![Frankfurt](image)\nFrankfurt\n![Düsseldorf](image)\nDüsseldorf\n![Hanover](image)\nHanover\n![Stuttgart](image)\nStuttgart\n![Cologne](image)\nCologne\n | Munich | Gelsenkirchen |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Olympiastadion | Parkstadion |\n| Capacity: **69,256** | Capacity: **70,748** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Hamburg | Frankfurt |\n| Volksparkstadion | Waldstadion |\n| Capacity: **61,330** | Capacity: **61,056** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Düsseldorf | Hanover | Stuttgart | Cologne |\n| Rheinstadion | Niedersachsenstadion | Neckarstadion | Müngersdorfer Stadion |\n| Capacity: **68,400** | Capacity: **60,366** | Capacity: **70,705** | Capacity: **60,584** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n\n\n## Squads[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 1988 squads\n\nEach national team had to submit a squad of 20 players.\n\n\n\n## Match officials[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Special stamp issued by Deutsche Bundespost for the tournament\n\n\n| Country\n | Referee\n | Linesmen\n | Matches refereed\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Austria | Horst Brummeier | Heinz Holzmann | Helmut Kohl | Republic of Ireland–Netherlands (group 2) |\n| ![](image) Belgium | Alexis Ponnet | Frans Van Den Wijngaert | Jean-François Crucke | Soviet Union–Italy (semi-finals) |\n| ![](image) East Germany | Siegfried Kirschen | Klaus Peschel | Manfred Roßner | England–Republic of Ireland (group 2) |\n| ![](image) England | Keith Hackett | Neil Midgley | Brian Hill | West Germany–Italy (group 1) |\n| ![](image) France | Michel Vautrot | Gérard Biguet | Rémi Harrel | West Germany–Spain (group 1)Soviet Union–Netherlands (final) |\n| ![](image) Italy | Paolo Casarin | Carlo Longhi | Pierluigi Magni | England–Netherlands (group 2) |\n| ![](image) Netherlands | Bep Thomas | John Blankenstein | Jacob van der Niet | Denmark–Spain (group 1) |\n| ![](image) Portugal | José Rosa dos Santos | José Francisco Conceição Silva | Fortunato Alves de Azevedo | England–Soviet Union (group 2) |\n| ![](image) Romania | Ioan Igna | Ștefan Dan Petrescu | Ion Crăciunescu | West Germany–Netherlands (semi-finals) |\n| ![](image) Scotland | Bob Valentine | Kenny Hope | Andrew Waddell | West Germany–Denmark (group 1) |\n| ![](image) Spain | Emilio Soriano Aladrén | José Donato Pes Pérez | José Mauro Socorro González | Republic of Ireland–Soviet Union (group 2) |\n| ![](image) Sweden | Erik Fredriksson | Bo Karlsson | Christer Drottz | Italy–Spain (group 1) |\n| ![](image) Switzerland | Bruno Galler | Renzo Peduzzi | Philippe Mercier | Italy–Denmark (group 1) |\n| ![](image) West Germany | Dieter Pauly | Karl-Heinz Tritschler | Aron Schmidhuber | Netherlands–Soviet Union (group 2) |\n\n\n**Fourth officials**\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | This list is incomplete; you can help by adding missing items. *(December 2019)*\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Country\n | Fourth officials\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Poland | Michał Listkiewicz |\n| ![](image) West Germany | Karl-Josef Assenmacher |\n| ![](image) West Germany | Werner Föckler |\n| ![](image) West Germany | Wolf-Günter Wiesel |\n\n\n## Group stage[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Results for UEFA Euro 1988 finalists\nThe teams finishing in the top two of each group progressed to the semi-finals.\n\n\n*All times are local, CEST (UTC+2).*\n\n\n\n### Tiebreakers[edit]\n\n\nIf two or more teams finished level on points after completion of the group matches, the following tie-breakers were used to determine the final ranking:\n\n\n\n1.

It was the eighth UEFA European Championship, which is held every four years and supported by UEFA.\n\n\nFrance were the defending champions, but failed to qualify. \n\n\nThe tournament crowned the Netherlands as European champions for the first time. Euro 88 was a rare instance of a major football tournament ending without a single sending-off or goalless draw, nor any knockout matches going to extra time or penalties. Euro 1988 was the final European Championship to see teams from West Germany and the Soviet Union, as the West and East Germans reunified to become Germany in 1990, and the Soviet Union disintegrated into 15 separate countries in 1991.\n\n\n\n\n## Bid process[edit]\n\n\nWest Germany won the right to host the tournament with five votes ahead of a joint bid from Norway, Sweden and Denmark, which earned one vote, and a bid from England.[1]\n\n\nBecause the Eastern Bloc disagreed that West Berlin was part of the Federal Republic of Germany, the German Football Association ruled out playing Championship matches in West Berlin. This secured the participation of Eastern European members of UEFA.[*citation needed*] In the 1974 FIFA World Cup, however, West Berlin had hosted three games.\n\n\nAs a compromise, Berlin Olympic Stadium did host a Four Nations Tournament in 1988, with West Germany playing against the Soviet Union, Argentina and Sweden.[2]\n\n\n\n## Overview[edit]\n\n\n### Group matches[edit]\n\n\nThe first group pitted two pre-tournament favourites West Germany and Italy together, along with Spain and Denmark. The West German team had won the 1980 European Championship and were the runners-up in each of the last two World Cups in 1982 and 1986, although in 1984 they failed to qualify from their group. With such results and additionally as the host they were commonly considered the main favourite of the tournament.\n\n\nThe Italians had not played at Euro 1984, though they had finished fourth in the 1980 tournament, for which they were the hosts; they had also won the 1982 World Cup, albeit followed by a middling performance in 1986. Spain and Denmark contested the second semi-final of the 1984 edition, in which Spain prevailed on penalty-kicks, but then lost the final to hosts, France (who failed to qualify in 1988). Both Spain and Denmark played in the 1986 World Cup, and met there again, in a Round of 16 match of the knockout stage which Spain won 5–1.\n\n\nThe Germans and Italians played out the opening game. This game was tightly contested. Roberto Mancini capitalised on a defensive error on the left-hand side of the German goal and the striker squeezed in a shot from a tight angle low to the left corner. Just three minutes later, Italy's goalkeeper, Walter Zenga was penalised for taking more than four steps with the ball and Andreas Brehme scored the resulting free-kick from the edge of the penalty area with a low shot to the right corner. Both teams settled for a 1–1 draw.\n\n\nSpain defeated Denmark again, this time 3–2. Míchel opened the scoring after five minutes with a shot to the left corner from inside the penalty area and Michael Laudrup equalised 20 minutes later with a left foot shot from the edge of the penalty area to the left corner. Spain dominated the next hour and Emilio Butragueño scored with a low shot through the goalkeepers legs and then Rafael Gordillo putting the Spanish 3–1 to the good with a free-kick which deceived the goalkeeper. A late surge saw Flemming Povlsen reduce the scoreline with a header in off the left post, but was not enough for the Danes, who now needed to win both their remaining games to be certain of a place in the semi-finals.\n\n\nIn the remaining games the West Germans swept aside the Danes and Spanish. Jürgen Klinsmann and Olaf Thon scored to dispatch the former 2–0 while two goals from Rudi Völler were enough to beat Spain 2–0. The second goal was particularly notable. Lothar Matthäus ran 40 yards into the Spanish penalty box before back-heeling the ball for the oncoming Völler, following up his run, to strike the ball with the outside of his foot and into the corner of the goal.\n\n\nThe Italians won a difficult match against the Spanish 1–0, courtesy of a goal from Gianluca Vialli, a low cross-shot to the net on 73 minutes. In the last game, against an already eliminated Denmark, the Italians prevailed 2–0.\n\n\nThe second group witnessed a surprising set of results. In the opening game, one of the pre-tournament favourites England lost 1–0 to Ireland. Ray Houghton scored a looping header after six minutes after the English defence failed to clear a cross. The English applied strong pressure as the game wore on. Gary Lineker was unusually sluggish, missing a series of chances and hitting the crossbar – he was later diagnosed with hepatitis B.[3] In the other opening game, the Soviet Union defeated the Netherlands 1–0 through a Vasyl Rats goal, despite the Dutch dominating for long periods.\n\n\nEngland met the Netherlands in Düsseldorf; both needed to win. England started strongly with Lineker hitting a post and Glenn Hoddle striking the post with a free-kick. The English defence, weakened by the absence of Terry Butcher, conceded the first of three goals to Marco van Basten on 44 minutes. Van Basten turned Butcher's replacement Tony Adams and beat Peter Shilton – playing his 100th game for England – to give his side a 1–0 lead. England rallied after the break. Lineker and Bryan Robson exchanged a kick one-two pass allowing Robson to burst into the box and lift the ball over Hans van Breukelen after 53 minutes. The score remained until Van Basten turned Tony Adams inside out to finish from 18 yards on 71 minutes. The striker pounced from close-range after a corner to seal a 3–1 win four minutes later.\n\n\nThe Irish and Soviets led the group after two games through a 1–1 draw in Hanover. Ronnie Whelan scored a spectacular left-foot volley from 18 yards to put the Irish into the lead. Oleh Protasov equalised with a low shot as the Soviets exerted late pressure.\n\n\nNeeding to defeat the Irish to progress, the Dutch won the game 1–0 through a late Wim Kieft goal. The ball deflected into his path and he delivered a looping header which spun into the right corner of the Irish net with nine minutes remaining just after Paul McGrath hit a Dutch post with a header. In the other game, the Soviets soundly thrashed England. A mistake from Hoddle allowed Sergei Aleinikov to score after three minutes. Adams equalised and England had chances to go ahead, but a goal before half-time and late in the game assured the Soviet Union would finish in first place in the group.[4]\n\n\n\n### Semi-finals and final[edit]\n\n\nThe first semi-final was significant as rivals West Germany played the Netherlands. It was only the third time the two sides had faced each other since the 1974 FIFA World Cup Final; the West Germans winning a first round match in the 1980 European Championship, and a 2–2 draw in a 1978 FIFA World Cup second round group match. The game was tight, and the West Germans broke the deadlock on 55 minutes with a Matthäus penalty after a foul on Klinsmann. The lead was held for 20 minutes until Jürgen Kohler brought down Van Basten. Ronald Koeman converted the spot-kick to level the match. With the match headed for extra time, a through ball caught the Germans out and Van Basten finished clinically with a shot as he slid along the floor, beating the goalkeeper and Kohler to the ball in the 88th minute for a 2–1 win. It gave the Dutch their first competitive victory against the Germans and the first appearance in the competition's final. The victory was marred by the reaction of Dutch defender Koeman who wiped the shirt of Olaf Thon, given to him after the match, on his backside in front of the German fans. The player apologised afterwards.\n\n\nThe other semi-final was another unpredictable result. Italy were strong favourites to reach the final and had beaten the Soviets 4–1 in a friendly just two months earlier. Despite controlling the play and having the majority of the chances, the Italians were undone by poor finishing and a strong, tough opposition who sought to stop their more skilful opponents from playing through hard tackles and a defensive strategy. The hard work-rate of the Soviets paid off and in just four second-half minutes, counter-attacks saw two goals from Hennadiy Lytovchenko and Oleg Protasov. The first one from Lytovchenko was initially blocked, but with quick reactions he beat Franco Baresi to the ball to fire the second shot into the far corner. The second from Protasov was a looping shot that floated over Zenga for a 2–0 victory. It would be the Soviet Union's fourth appearance in a European Championship final.\n\n\nThe final was played on 25 June between the Soviet Union, in what would turn out to be the nation's last European Championship match, and the Netherlands at the Olympiastadion in Munich. The Dutch won the match 2–0, with goals by captain Ruud Gullit and tournament top scorer Marco van Basten. Hans van Breukelen blocked a low penalty shot of Igor Belanov. Van Basten's goal, a sharply hit volley across the goal off an incoming looping pass, would later be described as one of the greatest goals in the history of the European Championships.[5][6]\n\n\n\n## Qualification[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 1988 qualifying\n\n### Qualified teams[edit]\n\n\nSeven countries had to qualify for the final stage. West Germany qualified automatically as hosts of the event. The Republic of Ireland qualified for the first time for any major tournament. The holders, France, failed to qualify despite finishing third in the 1986 World Cup. As of 2024, this is the last time that France failed to qualify for the European Championship finals, and since the conversion to a group stage in the finals tournament, this remains the only time the previous tournament winners failed to qualify for the next competition.[7] Other notable absentees were Belgium (the 1980 runners-up and 1986 FIFA World Cup semi-finalists) and Portugal (semi-finalists of Euro 1984).

It was the seventh UEFA European Championship, a competition held every four years and endorsed by UEFA.\n\n\nAt the time, only eight countries took part in the final stage of the tournament, seven of which had to come through the qualifying stage. France qualified automatically as hosts of the event; in the tournament led by Michel Platini, who scored nine goals in France's five matches, *Les Bleus* won the championship – their first major international title.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## Bid process[edit]\n\n\nThe hosting of the event was contested by bids from France and West Germany. The French bid was unanimously selected by the UEFA Executive Committee at a meeting on 10 December 1981.[2]\n\n\n\n## Tournament summary[edit]\n\n\n### Group matches[edit]\n\n\nThe opening game of tournament featured France and Denmark. The sides played out a very close encounter until Michel Platini's goal on 78 minutes gave the hosts a 1–0 victory. The opening game also saw a premature end to the tournament for Danish midfielder Allan Simonsen, who suffered a broken leg. Platini then scored hat-tricks against both Belgium and Yugoslavia as the French recorded maximum points in Group 1. Denmark took second place in the group with victories over Belgium and Yugoslavia, while Belgium finished third with two points. Yugoslavia, despite going out with no points, gave the hosts a fright in their last group game when they took a 1–0 lead into half-time and then reduced France's 3–1 lead to one goal six minutes from time. The games in Group 1 were unusually high-scoring, and featured 23 goals over the six matches.\n\n\nGroup 2 provided fewer goals, but produced a huge surprise as West Germany failed to qualify for the semi-finals after a 1–0 defeat in their last match to Spain with a late goal by Antonio Maceda, and a late Portugal win against Romania that sent the holders out.\n\n\n\n### Semi-finals and final[edit]\n\n\nThe first semi-final between France and Portugal is often considered one of the best matches in the history of the European Championship.[3] Jean-François Domergue opened the scoring for France but Portugal equalised through Rui Jordão on 74 minutes. The game went to extra time and Jordão scored again in the 98th minute to give the Portuguese a shock lead, but the French rallied and Domergue equalised with six minutes left. Then, in the dying moments of the match and with a penalty shoot-out looming, Platini scored his eighth goal of the championship to give France a memorable 3–2 victory.\n\n\nThe other semi-final between Spain and Denmark saw two evenly matched sides draw 1–1 after extra time, as Søren Lerby's goal after only seven minutes was cancelled out by Maceda’s strike an hour later. The match went to a penalty shoot-out, and Spain converted all five of their penalties to win 5–4 and reach the final for the first time since 1964.\n\n\nThe final was played to a capacity crowd at the Parc des Princes in Paris. Just before the hour mark, Platini scored from a free-kick to put France ahead following a mistake by Spanish goalkeeper Luis Arconada. France were reduced to ten players when Yvon Le Roux was sent off, but Spain were unable to equalise, and Bruno Bellone's goal in injury time made the final score 2–0. France had won their first major championship in world football.\n\n\n\n## Qualification[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 1984 qualifying\n\nPortugal and Romania made their debuts in the European Championship. France, the hosts and eventual winners, qualified for the first time since inaugural tournament in 1960, which they also hosted. Denmark qualified for the first time since 1964. Yugoslavia qualified after missing the 1980 tournament. Notable absentees were the 1982 FIFA World Cup winners and Euro 1980 hosts Italy, as well as 1966 World Cup winners England, Czechoslovakia, the Netherlands (who failed to qualify for the last time until 2016) and Hungary. \n\n\n\n### Qualified teams[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Team\n | Qualified as\n | Qualified on\n | Previous appearances in tournament[A] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) France | Host | 10 December 1981 | 1 (*1960*)\n |\n| ![](image) Belgium | Group 1 winner | 12 October 1983 | 2 (*1972*, 1980)\n |\n| ![](image) Portugal | Group 2 winner | 1 November 1983 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) Denmark | Group 3 winner | 16 November 1983 | 1 (1964)\n |\n| ![](image) West Germany | Group 6 winner | 20 November 1983 | 3 (**1972**, 1976, **1980**)\n |\n| ![](image) Romania | Group 5 winner | 30 November 1983 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) Yugoslavia | Group 4 winner | 21 December 1983 | 3 (1960, 1968, *1976*)\n |\n| ![](image) Spain | Group 7 winner | 21 December 1983 | 2 (***1964***, 1980)\n |\n\n\n1. **^** **Bold** indicates champion for that year. *Italic* indicates host for that year.\n\n## Organisation[edit]\n\n\n### Tournament format[edit]\n\n\nAfter trying out several formats, UEFA finally developed for the 1984 tournament the format that would serve for all subsequent eight-team European Championships.[4] The eight qualified teams were split into two groups of four that played a round-robin schedule. The top two teams of each group advanced to semi-finals (reintroduced after being absent from the 1980 tournament) and the winners advanced to the final. The third place play-off, widely perceived as an unnecessary chore, was dropped. As usual at the time, a win was credited with two points only, teams on equal points were ranked by goal difference instead of head-to-head results, and the sudden-death rule in extra time did not apply.\n\n\nFixtures were scheduled according to an innovative rotation schedule in which each team played its three first-round matches in three different stadia. Host France, for instance, played in Paris, Nantes, and Saint-Étienne. This formula had the advantage of exposing residents of a given city to more teams but implied multiple and sometimes costly trips from town to town for fans who wanted to follow their side. In subsequent championships, the organisers reverted to conventional schedules in which teams played in one or two cities only.\n\n\n\n### Overall impressions[edit]\n\n\nVery few hooligan-related incidents were recorded throughout the tournament. Only one minor instance of fan trouble was recorded, in Strasbourg around the West Germany vs. Portugal match. The small group of German hooligans responsible for the incidents was arrested and deported back to West Germany on the same day using a new law specially passed by the French Parliament ahead of the Euro. Overall, the organisation was flawless,[*citation needed*] a feat that established France's credentials as a host nation and eventually helped it win the right to stage the 1998 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\nThe entire competition was marked by exceptionally fine weather which, along with the high quality of play throughout the tournament (a welcome change from the 1980 European Championship) and the absence of hooligans, contributed to a very positive and enjoyable experience for teams and fans alike.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Mascot[edit]\n\n\nThe official mascot of this European Championship was **Peno**, a rooster, representing the emblem of the host nation, France. It has the number 84 on the left side of its chest and its outfit is the same as the France national team, blue shirt, white shorts and red socks.\n\n\n\n## Venues[edit]\n\n\nFrance's winning bid to host the Euro was based on seven stadia. The 48,000-seat Parc des Princes in Paris was the venue for the opening match and the final. Built in 1972, it was still state-of-the-art in 1984 and needed minor improvements only. Marseille's Stade Vélodrome was expanded to 55,000 seats to host one semi-final and some group matches, becoming France's largest stadium on the occasion. Stade de Gerland in Lyon, the venue for the other semi-final and some group matches as well, was thoroughly renovated and expanded to 40,000. Stade Geoffroy-Guichard in Saint-Étienne and Stade Félix-Bollaert in Lens were the other existing stadia that hosted group matches and were expanded to 53,000 and 49,000, respectively. Lastly, two all-new stadia were built to host group matches (and subsequently provided worthy home grounds for the traditionally strong local club teams): Stade de la Beaujoire in Nantes (53,000) was built on an entirely new site while Stade de la Meinau in Strasbourg was rebuilt from the ground up on the site of the old stadium into a modern 40,000-seat arena.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Paris | Marseille | Lyon |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Parc des Princes | Stade Vélodrome | Stade de Gerland |\n| Capacity: **48,360** | Capacity: **55,000** | Capacity: **51,860** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| ![UEFA Euro 1984 is located in France](image)![Paris](image)\nParis\n![Marseille](image)\nMarseille\n![Lyon](image)\nLyon\n![Saint-Étienne](image)\nSaint-Étienne\n![Lens](image)\nLens\n![Nantes](image)\nNantes\n![Strasbourg](image)\nStrasbourg\n | Saint-Étienne |\n| Stade Geoffroy-Guichard |\n| Capacity: **48,274** |\n| ![](image) |\n| Lens | Nantes | Strasbourg |\n| Stade Félix-Bollaert | Stade de la Beaujoire | Stade de la Meinau |\n| Capacity: **49,000** | Capacity: **52,923** | Capacity: **42,756** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n\n\n## Match officials[edit]\n\n\n* ![Austria](image) Heinz Fahnler\n* ![Belgium](image) Alexis Ponnet\n* ![Czechoslovakia](image) Vojtech Christov\n* ![East Germany](image) Adolf Prokop\n* ![England](image) George Courtney\n* ![France](image) Michel Vautrot\n* ![Italy](image) Paolo Bergamo\n* ![Netherlands](image) Jan Keizer\n* ![Scotland](image) Bob Valentine\n* ![Spain](image) Augusto Lamo Castillo\n* ![Soviet Union](image) Romualdas Juška\n* ![Sweden](image) Erik Fredriksson\n* ![Switzerland](image) André Daina\n* ![West Germany](image) Volker Roth\n\n## Squads[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 1984 squads\n\nEach national team had to submit a squad of 20 players.\n\n\n\n## Group stage[edit]\n\n\n![](image)1984 UEFA European Championship finalists.\nThe teams finishing in the top two positions in each of the two groups progress to the semi-finals, while the bottom two teams in each group were eliminated from the tournament.\n\n\n*All times are local, CEST (UTC+2).*\n\n\n\n### Tiebreakers[edit]\n\n\nIf two or more teams finished level on points after completion of the group matches, the following tie-breakers were used to determine the final ranking:\n\n\n\n1.

It was the seventh UEFA European Championship, a competition held every four years and endorsed by UEFA.\n\n\nAt the time, only eight countries took part in the final stage of the tournament, seven of which had to come through the qualifying stage. France qualified automatically as hosts of the event; in the tournament led by Michel Platini, who scored nine goals in France's five matches, *Les Bleus* won the championship – their first major international title.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## Bid process[edit]\n\n\nThe hosting of the event was contested by bids from France and West Germany. The French bid was unanimously selected by the UEFA Executive Committee at a meeting on 10 December 1981.[2]\n\n\n\n## Tournament summary[edit]\n\n\n### Group matches[edit]\n\n\nThe opening game of tournament featured France and Denmark. The sides played out a very close encounter until Michel Platini's goal on 78 minutes gave the hosts a 1–0 victory. The opening game also saw a premature end to the tournament for Danish midfielder Allan Simonsen, who suffered a broken leg. Platini then scored hat-tricks against both Belgium and Yugoslavia as the French recorded maximum points in Group 1. Denmark took second place in the group with victories over Belgium and Yugoslavia, while Belgium finished third with two points. Yugoslavia, despite going out with no points, gave the hosts a fright in their last group game when they took a 1–0 lead into half-time and then reduced France's 3–1 lead to one goal six minutes from time. The games in Group 1 were unusually high-scoring, and featured 23 goals over the six matches.\n\n\nGroup 2 provided fewer goals, but produced a huge surprise as West Germany failed to qualify for the semi-finals after a 1–0 defeat in their last match to Spain with a late goal by Antonio Maceda, and a late Portugal win against Romania that sent the holders out.\n\n\n\n### Semi-finals and final[edit]\n\n\nThe first semi-final between France and Portugal is often considered one of the best matches in the history of the European Championship.[3] Jean-François Domergue opened the scoring for France but Portugal equalised through Rui Jordão on 74 minutes. The game went to extra time and Jordão scored again in the 98th minute to give the Portuguese a shock lead, but the French rallied and Domergue equalised with six minutes left. Then, in the dying moments of the match and with a penalty shoot-out looming, Platini scored his eighth goal of the championship to give France a memorable 3–2 victory.\n\n\nThe other semi-final between Spain and Denmark saw two evenly matched sides draw 1–1 after extra time, as Søren Lerby's goal after only seven minutes was cancelled out by Maceda’s strike an hour later. The match went to a penalty shoot-out, and Spain converted all five of their penalties to win 5–4 and reach the final for the first time since 1964.\n\n\nThe final was played to a capacity crowd at the Parc des Princes in Paris. Just before the hour mark, Platini scored from a free-kick to put France ahead following a mistake by Spanish goalkeeper Luis Arconada. France were reduced to ten players when Yvon Le Roux was sent off, but Spain were unable to equalise, and Bruno Bellone's goal in injury time made the final score 2–0. France had won their first major championship in world football.\n\n\n\n## Qualification[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 1984 qualifying\n\nPortugal and Romania made their debuts in the European Championship. France, the hosts and eventual winners, qualified for the first time since inaugural tournament in 1960, which they also hosted. Denmark qualified for the first time since 1964. Yugoslavia qualified after missing the 1980 tournament. Notable absentees were the 1982 FIFA World Cup winners and Euro 1980 hosts Italy, as well as 1966 World Cup winners England, Czechoslovakia, the Netherlands (who failed to qualify for the last time until 2016) and Hungary. \n\n\n\n### Qualified teams[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Team\n | Qualified as\n | Qualified on\n | Previous appearances in tournament[A] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) France | Host | 10 December 1981 | 1 (*1960*)\n |\n| ![](image) Belgium | Group 1 winner | 12 October 1983 | 2 (*1972*, 1980)\n |\n| ![](image) Portugal | Group 2 winner | 1 November 1983 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) Denmark | Group 3 winner | 16 November 1983 | 1 (1964)\n |\n| ![](image) West Germany | Group 6 winner | 20 November 1983 | 3 (**1972**, 1976, **1980**)\n |\n| ![](image) Romania | Group 5 winner | 30 November 1983 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) Yugoslavia | Group 4 winner | 21 December 1983 | 3 (1960, 1968, *1976*)\n |\n| ![](image) Spain | Group 7 winner | 21 December 1983 | 2 (***1964***, 1980)\n |\n\n\n1. **^** **Bold** indicates champion for that year. *Italic* indicates host for that year.\n\n## Organisation[edit]\n\n\n### Tournament format[edit]\n\n\nAfter trying out several formats, UEFA finally developed for the 1984 tournament the format that would serve for all subsequent eight-team European Championships.[4] The eight qualified teams were split into two groups of four that played a round-robin schedule. The top two teams of each group advanced to semi-finals (reintroduced after being absent from the 1980 tournament) and the winners advanced to the final. The third place play-off, widely perceived as an unnecessary chore, was dropped. As usual at the time, a win was credited with two points only, teams on equal points were ranked by goal difference instead of head-to-head results, and the sudden-death rule in extra time did not apply.\n\n\nFixtures were scheduled according to an innovative rotation schedule in which each team played its three first-round matches in three different stadia. Host France, for instance, played in Paris, Nantes, and Saint-Étienne. This formula had the advantage of exposing residents of a given city to more teams but implied multiple and sometimes costly trips from town to town for fans who wanted to follow their side. In subsequent championships, the organisers reverted to conventional schedules in which teams played in one or two cities only.\n\n\n\n### Overall impressions[edit]\n\n\nVery few hooligan-related incidents were recorded throughout the tournament. Only one minor instance of fan trouble was recorded, in Strasbourg around the West Germany vs. Portugal match. The small group of German hooligans responsible for the incidents was arrested and deported back to West Germany on the same day using a new law specially passed by the French Parliament ahead of the Euro. Overall, the organisation was flawless,[*citation needed*] a feat that established France's credentials as a host nation and eventually helped it win the right to stage the 1998 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\nThe entire competition was marked by exceptionally fine weather which, along with the high quality of play throughout the tournament (a welcome change from the 1980 European Championship) and the absence of hooligans, contributed to a very positive and enjoyable experience for teams and fans alike.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Mascot[edit]\n\n\nThe official mascot of this European Championship was **Peno**, a rooster, representing the emblem of the host nation, France. It has the number 84 on the left side of its chest and its outfit is the same as the France national team, blue shirt, white shorts and red socks.\n\n\n\n## Venues[edit]\n\n\nFrance's winning bid to host the Euro was based on seven stadia. The 48,000-seat Parc des Princes in Paris was the venue for the opening match and the final. Built in 1972, it was still state-of-the-art in 1984 and needed minor improvements only. Marseille's Stade Vélodrome was expanded to 55,000 seats to host one semi-final and some group matches, becoming France's largest stadium on the occasion. Stade de Gerland in Lyon, the venue for the other semi-final and some group matches as well, was thoroughly renovated and expanded to 40,000. Stade Geoffroy-Guichard in Saint-Étienne and Stade Félix-Bollaert in Lens were the other existing stadia that hosted group matches and were expanded to 53,000 and 49,000, respectively. Lastly, two all-new stadia were built to host group matches (and subsequently provided worthy home grounds for the traditionally strong local club teams): Stade de la Beaujoire in Nantes (53,000) was built on an entirely new site while Stade de la Meinau in Strasbourg was rebuilt from the ground up on the site of the old stadium into a modern 40,000-seat arena.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Paris | Marseille | Lyon |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Parc des Princes | Stade Vélodrome | Stade de Gerland |\n| Capacity: **48,360** | Capacity: **55,000** | Capacity: **51,860** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| ![UEFA Euro 1984 is located in France](image)![Paris](image)\nParis\n![Marseille](image)\nMarseille\n![Lyon](image)\nLyon\n![Saint-Étienne](image)\nSaint-Étienne\n![Lens](image)\nLens\n![Nantes](image)\nNantes\n![Strasbourg](image)\nStrasbourg\n | Saint-Étienne |\n| Stade Geoffroy-Guichard |\n| Capacity: **48,274** |\n| ![](image) |\n| Lens | Nantes | Strasbourg |\n| Stade Félix-Bollaert | Stade de la Beaujoire | Stade de la Meinau |\n| Capacity: **49,000** | Capacity: **52,923** | Capacity: **42,756** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n\n\n## Match officials[edit]\n\n\n* ![Austria](image) Heinz Fahnler\n* ![Belgium](image) Alexis Ponnet\n* ![Czechoslovakia](image) Vojtech Christov\n* ![East Germany](image) Adolf Prokop\n* ![England](image) George Courtney\n* ![France](image) Michel Vautrot\n* ![Italy](image) Paolo Bergamo\n* ![Netherlands](image) Jan Keizer\n* ![Scotland](image) Bob Valentine\n* ![Spain](image) Augusto Lamo Castillo\n* ![Soviet Union](image) Romualdas Juška\n* ![Sweden](image) Erik Fredriksson\n* ![Switzerland](image) André Daina\n* ![West Germany](image) Volker Roth\n\n## Squads[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 1984 squads\n\nEach national team had to submit a squad of 20 players.\n\n\n\n## Group stage[edit]\n\n\n![](image)1984 UEFA European Championship finalists.\nThe teams finishing in the top two positions in each of the two groups progress to the semi-finals, while the bottom two teams in each group were eliminated from the tournament.\n\n\n*All times are local, CEST (UTC+2).*\n\n\n\n### Tiebreakers[edit]\n\n\nIf two or more teams finished level on points after completion of the group matches, the following tie-breakers were used to determine the final ranking:\n\n\n\n1.

It is governed by the Royal Spanish Football Federation, the governing body for football in Spain.\n\n\nSpain is one of eight national teams to have been crowned world champions and have participated in a total of 16 of 22 FIFA World Cups, also qualifying consistently since 1978. Spain have won three continental titles during their appearances of 11 out of 16 UEFA European Championships. Spain currently competes in League A of the UEFA Nations League alongside the other top teams of Europe. Their best result was in the 2022–23 season where they reached the final, winning against Croatia.\n\n\nSpain's achievements from 2008–2012 have led many experts and commentators to consider this era's Spain squads one of the best ever teams in football history.[5][6][7][8][9] During this period, Spain became the only national team to win three consecutive major titles, including two back-to-back European Championships in 2008 and 2012, while becoming the first European team to win a World Cup held outside of Europe in 2010.[10] From 2008 to 2013, Spain won the FIFA Team of the Year, the second-most of any nation, behind only Brazil.[11] From the start of 2007 to the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup, Spain achieved 35 consecutive undefeated matches, a feat which they shared with Brazil, and a sport record at the time. Spain along with France are the only two European countries to have won the triplete (World Cup, Euro, Nations League).\nSpain is one of only two nations to have won both the FIFA World Cup and the FIFA Women's World Cup (the other being Germany).\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: History of the Spain national football team\n\n![](image)Spain national football team in the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp\nSpain has been a member of FIFA since its founding in 1904, even though the Spanish Football Federation was first established in 1909. The first Spain national football team was constituted in 1920, with the main objective of finding a team that would represent Spain at the 1920 Summer Olympics held in Belgium in that same year. Spain made their debut at the tournament on 28 August 1920 against Denmark, silver medalists at the last two Olympic tournaments. Spain managed to win that match by a scoreline of 1–0, eventually finishing with the silver medal.[12] Spain qualified for their first FIFA World Cup in 1934, defeating Brazil in their first game and losing in a replay to the hosts and eventual champions Italy in the quarter-finals.[13] The Spanish Civil War and World War II prevented Spain from playing any competitive matches between the 1934 World Cup and the 1950 edition's qualifiers. At the 1950 finals in Brazil, they topped their group to progress to the finals round, then finished in fourth place.[14] Until 2010, this had been Spain's highest finish in a FIFA World Cup finals.[15]\n\n\nSpain won its first major international title when it hosted the 1964 European Nations' Cup held in Spain, defeating the Soviet Union 2–1 in the finals at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium.[16] The victory would stand as Spain's lone major title for 44 years. Spain was selected as host of the 1982 FIFA World Cup, reaching the second round and four years later they reached the quarter-finals before a penalty shootout defeat to Belgium.[17] Also at UEFA Euro 1984, they lost the final against France.[18] Spain reached the quarter-finals of the 1994 World Cup. The match became controversial when Italian defender Mauro Tassotti struck Luis Enrique with his elbow inside Spain's penalty area, causing Luis Enrique to bleed profusely from his nose and mouth, but the foul was not noticed nor sanctioned by referee Sándor Puhl. Had the official acknowledged the foul, Spain would have merited a penalty kick.[19] In the 2002 World Cup, Spain won its three group play matches, then defeated the Republic of Ireland on penalties in the second round. They faced co-hosts South Korea in the quarter-finals, losing in a shootout after having two goals controversially called back for alleged infractions during regular and extra time.[20]\n\n\n\n![](image)World Cup champions parade, celebrate as they pass in front of the Air Force Headquarters in Madrid.\nAt UEFA Euro 2008, Spain won all their games in Group D. Italy were the opponents in the quarter-finals match, which Spain won 4–2 on penalties. They then met Russia again in the semi-finals, beating them 3–0.[21] In the final, Spain defeated Germany 1–0, with Fernando Torres scoring the only goal of the game.[22] This was Spain's first major title since the 1964 European Championship. Xavi was awarded the player of the tournament.[nb 1] The following year the side finished third at the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup breaking their 35-match unbeaten streak that began in November 2006 after a loss to the United States.[23] In the 2010 World Cup, Spain advanced to the final for the first time ever by defeating Germany 1–0. In the decisive match against the Netherlands, Andrés Iniesta scored the match's only goal, coming in extra time. Spain became the third team to win a World Cup outside their own continent, and the first European team to do so. Goalkeeper Iker Casillas won the golden glove for only conceding two goals during the tournament, while David Villa won the bronze ball and silver boot, tied for top scorer of the tournament. Spain qualified top of Group I in qualification for UEFA Euro 2012 with a perfect 100% record.[5] They became the first team to retain the European Championship, winning the final 4–0 against Italy, while Fernando Torres won the Golden Boot for top scorer of the tournament.[24]\n\n\nSpain advanced to the final of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, losing to hosts Brazil,[25] and the following year they were eliminated from the group stage of the 2014 World Cup.[26] At Euro 2016 and the 2018 World Cup, the side reached the last 16 in both tournaments, losing to Italy 2–0 and Russia 3–2 on penalties after a 1–1 draw.[27][28] In the UEFA Euro 2020, held in 2021 after COVID-19 pandemic caused delays, Spain made a breakthrough, reaching the last four of a major tournament for the first time since 2012, before losing to eventual champions Italy 4–2 on penalties after a 1–1 draw. The team finished the tournament with two wins and four draws (including two penalty shootouts).[29] The same year they managed to reach the 2021 UEFA Nations League Final, losing against France.[30] In the 2022 World Cup, Spain finished second in their group, then in the round of 16, they lost to Morocco 3–0 on penalties after a 0–0 draw, to be the third consecutive elimination from a major tournament in penalty shootouts.[31]\n\n\n\n## Team image[edit]\n\n\n### Nicknames[edit]\n\n\nSpain's team is commonly known by fans as \"*La Furia Roja*\", meaning *the Red Fury* in Spanish.[1] recalling the \"Sack of Antwerp\" – an episode in the military history of Spain.[32] However, there are another unofficial nicknames to refer to the national team of Spain.\n\n\nThe other most common nickname, known by fans, is \"*Los Toros*\" (*Fighting Bulls*), since Spanish Fighting Bull is one of Spain's famous national treasures and often used to define Spanish culture, and also often depicted by Spanish supporters alike.[33] The Spain football team is sometimes referred as the Bulls due to this cultural heritage.[34]\n\n\nThe Spanish team also received other nicknames, mostly \"*Toreros*\" or \"*Matador*\" (*Bullfighters* in Spanish), to describe its passionate and romantic style of football playing.[35]\n\n\n\n### Style of play[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tiki-taka\n\n![](image)Spain, UEFA Euro 2008 winners\n![](image)Spain's players celebrate winning the 2010 FIFA World Cup\n![](image)Spain, UEFA Euro 2012 winners\nBetween 2008 and 2012, the team played a style of football dubbed 'tiki-taka', a systems approach to football founded upon the ideal of team unity and a comprehensive understanding in the geometry of space on a football field.[36]\n\n\nTiki-taka has been variously described as \"a style of play based on making your way to the back of the net through short passing and movement\",[37] a \"short passing style in which the ball is worked carefully through various channels\",[38] and a \"nonsensical phrase that has come to mean short passing, patience and possession above all else\".[39] The style involves roaming movement and positional interchange amongst midfielders, moving the ball in intricate patterns,[40] and sharp, one or two-touch passing.[41] Tiki-taka is \"both defensive and offensive in equal measure\" – the team is always in possession, so doesn't need to switch between defending and attacking.[42] Commentators have contrasted tiki-taka with \"Route One physicality\"[37] and with the higher-tempo passing of Barcelona and Arsène Wenger's 2007–08 Arsenal side, which employed Cesc Fàbregas as the only channel between defence and attack.[38] Tiki-taka is associated with flair, creativity, and touch,[43] but can also be taken to a \"slow, directionless extreme\" that sacrifices effectiveness for aesthetics.[39]\n\n\nTiki-taka was successfully employed by Spain to win Euro 2008, the 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012. The 2008–12 teams are regarded as being among the greatest of international teams in football history.[7][5][6]\n\n\n\n\n> They have the Barcelona \"carousel\" of Xavi and Andrés Iniesta augmented by Real Madrid's Xabi Alonso in midfield.\n> \n> — Phil McNulty of the BBC on the midfield players at the heart of Spain's tiki-taka passing style of play.[5]\n> \n\n\nSid Lowe identifies Luis Aragonés' tempering of tiki-taka with pragmatism as a key factor in Spain's success in Euro 2008. Aragonés used tiki-taka to \"protect a defense that appeared suspect [...], maintain possession and dominate games\" without taking the style to \"evangelical extremes\". None of Spain's first six goals in the tournament came from tiki-taka: five came from direct breaks and one from a set play.[39] For Lowe, Spain's success in the 2010 World Cup was evidence of the meeting of two traditions in Spanish football: the \"powerful, aggressive, direct\" style that earned the silver medal-winning 1920 Antwerp Olympic team the nickname *La Furia Roja* (\"The Red Fury\") and the tiki-taka style of the contemporary Spain's team, which focused on a collective, short-passing, technical and possession-based game.[44]\n\n\nAnalyzing Spain's semi-final victory over Germany at the 2010 World Cup, Raphael Honigstein described Spain's tiki-taka style as \"the most difficult version of football possible: an uncompromising passing game, coupled with intense, high pressing\". For Honigstein, tiki-taka is \"a significant upgrade\" of the Netherlands' Total Football because it relies on ball movement rather than players switching position. Tiki-taka allowed Spain to \"control both the ball and the opponent\".[42]\n\n\n\n\n> We have the same idea as each other. Keep the ball, create movement around and off the ball, get in the spaces to cause danger.\n> \n> — Xabi Alonso (Spanish midfielder).[41]\n> \n\n\n### Kits and crest[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Spain national football team kits.\n\nSpain's kit is traditionally a red jersey with yellow trim, dark blue shorts and black socks, whilst their current away kit is all predominantly white. The colour of the socks altered throughout the 1990s from black to the same blue colour as the shorts, matching either the blue of the shorts or the red of the shirt until the mid-2010s when they returned to their traditional black. Spain's kits have been produced by manufacturers including Adidas (from 1981 until 1983), Le Coq Sportif (from 1983 until 1991) and Adidas once again (since 1991). Rather than displaying the logo of the Spanish football federation, Spain's jersey traditionally features the country's coat of arms over the left side. After winning the 2010 World Cup, the World Cup winners badge was added to the right side of the jersey and a golden star at the top of Spain's coat of arms.\n\n\n\n#### Kit suppliers[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Kit supplier\n | Period\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| *None* | 1920–1935\n |  |\n| ![Spain](image) Deportes Cóndor\n | 1935–1966\n |  |\n| ![England](image) Umbro | 1966\n |  |\n| ![Spain](image) Deportes Cóndor\n | 1967–1981\n |  |\n| ![West Germany](image) Adidas | 1981–1983\n |  |\n| ![France](image) Le Coq Sportif | 1984–1990\n |  |\n| ![Germany](image) Adidas | 1991–present\n | Current until 2030[45][46] |\n\n\n### Home stadium[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of stadiums in Spain\n\nSpain does not have a designated national stadium. The capital city of Madrid (Bernabéu and Metropolitano), Seville (Pizjuán, La Cartuja and Villamarín), Valencia (Mestalla and Orriols) and Barcelona (Camp Nou and Montjuïc), are the four Spanish cities that have hosted more than 15 national team matches, while also being home to the largest stadiums in the country.[47]\n\n\nOther friendly matches, as well as qualifying fixtures against smaller opponents, are played in provincial stadia. The 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign included matches at the Reino de León in León,[48] Los Cármenes in Granada,[49] El Molinón in Gijón,[50] and the Rico Pérez in Alicante.[51]\n\n\n\n### Media coverage[edit]\n\n\nSpain's UEFA European Qualifiers and UEFA Nations League matches, and all friendly games from 2018 until 2022, will be televised nationwide by La 1, flagship television channel of the public broadcaster TVE.[52]\n\n\n\n## Rivalries[edit]\n\n\nSpain has four main rivalries with other top footballing nations.\n\n\n\n* Their rivalry with **Italy**, sometimes referred to as the *Mediterranean Derby*,[53] contested since 1920. Although the two nations are not immediate geographical neighbours, their rivalry at international level is enhanced by the strong performances of the representative clubs in UEFA competitions, in which they are among the leading associations and have each enjoyed spells of dominance.[54][55] Since the quarter-finals match between the two countries at Euro 2008, the rivalry has renewed, with its most notable match between the two sides being in the UEFA Euro 2012 Final, which Spain won 4–0.[56][57]\n* Their rivalry with **Portugal**, also known as the *Iberian Derby*, is one of the oldest football rivalries at a national level. It began on 18 December 1921, when Portugal lost 3–1 to Spain at Madrid in their first ever international friendly game. Portugal lost their first matches, with their first draw (2–2) only coming in 1926. Portugal's first win came much later (4–1) in 1947. Both belong to the strongest football nations of the world, and have met a total of 39 times (of which 9 matches were competitive) which resulted in 16 victories for Spain, 17 draws and 6 victories for Portugal.\n* Their rivalry with **France**, also another major football force, is also one of the oldest at a national level. Spain and France have met a total of 36 times, began with a 4–0 triumph for Spain in a friendly in Bordeaux on 30 April 1922, though their first competitive meeting came in the UEFA Euro 1984 Final, which France won to take over its first major international honours.[58][59] Spain has the advantage in head-to-head competition with 16 wins, 13 losses and 7 draws, though France has gotten more international glories than Spain.\n* Their rivalry with **Germany**, is also one of the oldest at a national level. Germany and Spain have faced each other 26 times, started with a 2–1 friendly victory for Spain on 12 May 1935 in Cologne. However, Spain only met Germany for the first time in any competitive fixture in 1966, as part of the 1966 FIFA World Cup, where Germany (known as West Germany at the time) came back to win 2–1.[60] However, since the unification of Germany in 1991, Spain has remained undefeated in competitive fixtures against Germany, including the famous 6–0 rout in the 2020–21 UEFA Nations League A.[61] Total head-to-head result however is slightly favourable for Germany with 9 wins, 9 draws compared to 8 wins by Spain.\n\n\n## Results and fixtures[edit]\n\n\nFor all past match results of the national team, see single-season articles, and Spain national football team results.\n\nFurther information: 2022–23 in Spanish football and 2023–24 in Spanish football\n\nThe following is a list of match results in the last 12 months, as well as any future matches that have been scheduled.\n\n\n  Win\n  Draw\n  Loss\n  Fixture\n\n\n\n### 2022[edit]\n\n\nSpain ![](image) v ![](image) Costa Rica\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 23 November 2022 2022 FIFA World Cup Group E |  **Spain ![](image)**  | **7–0** |  **![](image) Costa Rica**  | Doha, Qatar |\n| 19:00 UTC+3 | * Olmo ![](image) 11'\n* Asensio ![](image) 21'\n* Torres ![](image) 31' (pen.), 54'\n* Gavi ![](image) 74'\n* Soler ![](image) 90'\n* Morata ![](image) 90+2'\n | Report |  | Stadium: Al Thumama StadiumAttendance: 40,013Referee: Mohammed Abdulla Hassan Mohamed (United Arab Emirates) |\n\nSpain ![](image) v ![](image) Germany\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 27 November 2022 2022 FIFA World Cup Group E |  **Spain ![](image)**  | **1–1** |  **![](image) Germany**  | Al Khor, Qatar |\n| 22:00 UTC+3 | * Morata ![](image) 62'\n | Report | * Füllkrug ![](image) 83'\n | Stadium: Al-Bayt StadiumAttendance: 68,895Referee: Danny Makkelie (Netherlands) |\n\nJapan ![](image) v ![](image) Spain\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 December 2022 2022 FIFA World Cup Group E |  **Japan ![](image)**  | **2–1** |  **![](image) Spain**  | Al Rayyan, Qatar |\n| 22:00 UTC+3 | * Dōan ![](image) 48'\n* Tanaka ![](image) 51'\n | Report | * Morata ![](image) 11'\n | Stadium: Khalifa International StadiumAttendance: 44,851Referee: Victor Gomes (South Africa) |\n\nMorocco ![](image) v ![](image) Spain\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 6 December 2022 2022 FIFA World Cup R16 |  **Morocco ![](image)**  | **0–0** (a.e.t.)

World Cup[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Spain at the FIFA World Cup\n\nAlthough often entering tournaments as one of the favorites, Spain have often underachieved at the World Cup.[*citation needed*] Spain's first World Cup was in 1934. At that World Cup, Spain started their campaign by defeating Brazil 3–1 to advance to the quarter-finals, where they lost to hosts Italy. Before Spain's success in 2010, their best result came in 1950, where they reached the last four. Spain were paired with the hosts Brazil, as well as Uruguay and Sweden. Spain managed a draw against Uruguay but defeats from Brazil and Sweden meant that Spain would end up in fourth place. At the 2010 FIFA World Cup held in South Africa, Spain became world champions for the first time after defeating the Netherlands 1–0 in the final, becoming the eight country to win the World Cup and the first European team to lift the trophy outside of their continent. \n\n\n  **Champions**    **Runners-up**    **Third place**     Tournament played fully or partially on home soil  \n\n\n\n\n\n| FIFA World Cup record\n |  | Qualification record\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Year\n | Round\n | Position\n | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA |\n| ![Uruguay](image) 1930 | *Did not enter* | *Did not enter* |\n| ![Italy](image) 1934 | Quarter-finals\n | 5th\n | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | 4\n | 3\n | 2\n | 2\n | 0\n | 0\n | 11\n | 1\n |\n| ![France](image) 1938 | *Withdrew* | *Withdrew* |\n| ![Brazil](image) 1950 | **Fourth place** | **4th** | **6** | **3** | **1** | **2** | **10** | **12** | 2\n | 1\n | 1\n | 0\n | 7\n | 3\n |\n| ![Switzerland](image) 1954 | *Did not qualify* | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | 6\n | 4\n |\n| ![Sweden](image) 1958 | 4\n | 2\n | 1\n | 1\n | 12\n | 8\n |\n| ![Chile](image) 1962 | Group stage\n | 13th\n | 3\n | 1\n | 0\n | 2\n | 2\n | 3\n | 4\n | 3\n | 1\n | 0\n | 7\n | 4\n |\n| ![England](image) 1966 | 10th\n | 3\n | 1\n | 0\n | 2\n | 4\n | 5\n | 3\n | 2\n | 0\n | 1\n | 5\n | 2\n |\n| ![Mexico](image) 1970 | *Did not qualify* | 6\n | 2\n | 2\n | 2\n | 10\n | 6\n |\n| ![West Germany](image) 1974 | 5\n | 2\n | 2\n | 1\n | 8\n | 6\n |\n| ![Argentina](image) 1978 | Group stage\n | 10th\n | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | 2\n | 2\n | 4\n | 3\n | 0\n | 1\n | 4\n | 1\n |\n| ![Spain](image) 1982 | Second group stage\n | 12th\n | 5\n | 1\n | 2\n | 2\n | 4\n | 5\n | *Qualified as host* |\n| ![Mexico](image) 1986 | Quarter-finals\n | 7th\n | 5\n | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 11\n | 4\n | 6\n | 4\n | 0\n | 2\n | 9\n | 8\n |\n| ![Italy](image) 1990 | Round of 16\n | 10th\n | 4\n | 2\n | 1\n | 1\n | 6\n | 4\n | 8\n | 6\n | 1\n | 1\n | 20\n | 3\n |\n| ![United States](image) 1994 | Quarter-finals\n | 8th\n | 5\n | 2\n | 2\n | 1\n | 10\n | 6\n | 12\n | 8\n | 3\n | 1\n | 27\n | 4\n |\n| ![France](image) 1998 | Group stage\n | 17th\n | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | 8\n | 4\n | 10\n | 8\n | 2\n | 0\n | 26\n | 6\n |\n| ![South Korea](image) ![Japan](image) 2002 | Quarter-finals\n | 5th\n | 5\n | 3\n | 2\n | 0\n | 10\n | 5\n | 8\n | 6\n | 2\n | 0\n | 21\n | 4\n |\n| ![Germany](image) 2006 | Round of 16\n | 9th\n | 4\n | 3\n | 0\n | 1\n | 9\n | 4\n | 12\n | 6\n | 6\n | 0\n | 25\n | 5\n |\n| ![South Africa](image) 2010 | **Champions** | **1st** | **7** | **6** | **0** | **1** | **8** | **2** | 10\n | 10\n | 0\n | 0\n | 28\n | 5\n |\n| ![Brazil](image) 2014 | Group stage\n | 23rd\n | 3\n | 1\n | 0\n | 2\n | 4\n | 7\n | 8\n | 6\n | 2\n | 0\n | 14\n | 3\n |\n| ![Russia](image) 2018 | Round of 16\n | 10th\n | 4\n | 1\n | 3\n | 0\n | 7\n | 6\n | 10\n | 9\n | 1\n | 0\n | 36\n | 3\n |\n| ![Qatar](image) 2022 | 13th\n | 4\n | 1\n | 2\n | 1\n | 9\n | 3\n | 8\n | 6\n | 1\n | 1\n | 15\n | 5\n |\n| ![Canada](image) ![Mexico](image) ![United States](image) 2026 | *To be determined* | *To be determined* |\n| ![Morocco](image) ![Portugal](image) ![Spain](image)\n![Argentina](image)\n![Paraguay](image)\n![Uruguay](image) 2030\n | *Qualified as co-hosts* | *Qualified as co-hosts* |\n| ![Saudi Arabia](image) 2034 | *To be determined* | *To be determined* |\n| Total\n | 1 Title\n | 16/22\n | 67\n | 31\n | 17\n | 19\n | 108\n | 75\n | 125\n | 87\n | 26\n | 12\n | 291\n | 81\n |\n\n\n\n\n| **Spain's World Cup record** |\n| --- |\n| First match\n | ![](image) Spain 3–1 Brazil ![](image)(27 May 1934; Genoa, Italy)\n |\n| Biggest win\n | ![](image) Spain 7–0 Costa Rica ![](image)(23 November 2022; Doha, Qatar)\n |\n| Biggest defeat\n | ![](image) Brazil 6–1 Spain ![](image)(13 July 1950; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil)\n |\n| Best result\n | **Champions** in 2010 |\n| Worst result\n | Group Stage in 1962, 1966, 1978, 1998, 2014 |\n\n\n### UEFA European Championship[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Spain at the UEFA European Championship\n\nSpain have won the joint most UEFA European Championships, along with Germany (3 titles). La Roja are the only nation to date to have won consecutive championships. They have hosted the tournament once, in 1964 (one city was used to host games at Euro 2020) and have appeared in a total of 11 tournaments. \n\n\nThe team won their first international trophy on home soil in 1964, defeating the Soviet Union 2–1. Spain would reach the final twenty years later in 1984, where they would lose the final to France. Spain would not reach the final again until 2008, where they would defeat Germany 1–0. Four years later, Spain earned back-to-back titles, comprehensively defeating Italy 4–0 in the final in Kiev.\n\n\n\n\n\n| UEFA European Championship record\n |  | Qualifying record\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Year\n | Round\n | Position\n | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA |\n| ![France](image) 1960 | *Withdrew* | 2\n | 2\n | 0\n | 0\n | 7\n | 2\n |\n| ![Spain](image) 1964 | **Champions** | **1st** | **2** | **2** | **0** | **0** | **4** | **2** | 6\n | 4\n | 1\n | 1\n | 16\n | 5\n |\n| ![Italy](image) 1968 | *Did not qualify* | 8\n | 3\n | 2\n | 3\n | 7\n | 5\n |\n| ![Belgium](image) 1972 | 6\n | 3\n | 2\n | 1\n | 14\n | 3\n |\n| ![Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia](image) 1976 | 8\n | 3\n | 4\n | 1\n | 11\n | 9\n |\n| ![Italy](image) 1980 | Group stage\n | 7th\n | 3\n | 0\n | 1\n | 2\n | 2\n | 4\n | 6\n | 4\n | 1\n | 1\n | 13\n | 5\n |\n| ![France](image) 1984 | **Runners-up** | **2nd** | **5** | **1** | **3** | **1** | **4** | **5** | 8\n | 6\n | 1\n | 1\n | 24\n | 8\n |\n| ![West Germany](image) 1988 | Group stage\n | 6th\n | 3\n | 1\n | 0\n | 2\n | 3\n | 5\n | 6\n | 5\n | 0\n | 1\n | 14\n | 6\n |\n| ![Sweden](image) 1992 | *Did not qualify* | 7\n | 3\n | 0\n | 4\n | 17\n | 12\n |\n| ![England](image) 1996 | Quarter-finals\n | 6th\n | 4\n | 1\n | 3\n | 0\n | 4\n | 3\n | 10\n | 8\n | 2\n | 0\n | 25\n | 4\n |\n| ![Belgium](image) ![Netherlands](image) 2000 | 5th\n | 4\n | 2\n | 0\n | 2\n | 7\n | 7\n | 8\n | 7\n | 0\n | 1\n | 42\n | 5\n |\n| ![Portugal](image) 2004 | Group stage\n | 10th\n | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | 2\n | 2\n | 10\n | 7\n | 2\n | 1\n | 21\n | 5\n |\n| ![Austria](image) ![Switzerland](image) 2008 | **Champions** | **1st** | **6** | **5** | **1** | **0** | **12** | **3** | 12\n | 9\n | 1\n | 2\n | 23\n | 8\n |\n| ![Poland](image) ![Ukraine](image) 2012 | **Champions** | **1st** | **6** | **4** | **2** | **0** | **12** | **1** | 8\n | 8\n | 0\n | 0\n | 26\n | 6\n |\n| ![France](image) 2016 | Round of 16\n | 10th\n | 4\n | 2\n | 0\n | 2\n | 5\n | 4\n | 10\n | 9\n | 0\n | 1\n | 23\n | 3\n |\n| ![Europe](image) 2020 | **Semi-finals** | **3rd** | **6** | **2** | **4** | **0** | **13** | **6** | 10\n | 8\n | 2\n | 0\n | 31\n | 5\n |\n| ![Germany](image) 2024 | *Qualified* | 8\n | 7\n | 0\n | 1\n | 25\n | 5\n |\n| ![United Kingdom](image) ![Republic of Ireland](image) 2028 | *To be determined* |\n| ![Italy](image) ![Turkey](image) 2032 |\n| Total\n | 3 Titles\n | 12/17\n | 46\n | 21\n | 15\n | 10\n | 68\n | 42\n | 128\n | 91\n | 18\n | 19\n | 320\n | 94\n |\n\n\n\n\n| **Spain's European Championship record** |\n| --- |\n| First match\n | ![](image) Spain 2–1 Hungary ![](image)(Madrid, Spain; 17 June 1964)\n |\n| Biggest win\n | ![](image) Spain 5–0 Slovakia ![](image)(Seville, Spain; 23 June 2021)\n |\n| Biggest defeat\n | ![](image) France 2–0 Spain ![](image)(Paris, France; 27 June 1984)![](image) West Germany 2–0 Spain ![](image)(Munich, West Germany; 17 June 1988)![](image) Italy 2–0 Spain ![](image) (Saint-Denis, France; 27 June 2016)\n |\n| Best result\n | **Champions** in 1964, 2008, 2012 |\n| Worst result\n | Group stage in 1980, 1988, 2004 |\n\n\n### UEFA Nations League[edit]\n\n\nSince the inaugural UEFA Nations League, La Roja have remained in League A and have reached the UEFA Nations League Finals on two occasions.

The men's national team is controlled by the Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB), the governing body for football in the Netherlands, which is a part of UEFA, under the jurisdiction of FIFA. They were sometimes regarded as the greatest national team of the respective generations.[6][7][8][9] Most of the Netherlands home matches are played at the Johan Cruyff Arena, De Kuip, Philips Stadion and De Grolsch Veste.\n\n\nThe team is colloquially referred to as *Het Nederlands Elftal* (The Dutch Eleven) or *Oranje*, after the House of Orange-Nassau and their distinctive orange jerseys. Informally the team, like the country itself, was referred to as ***Holland***. The fan club is known as *Het Oranje Legioen* (The Orange Legion).[10]\n\n\nThe Netherlands has competed in eleven FIFA World Cups, appearing in the final three times (in 1974, 1978 and 2010). They finished runners-up on all three occasions. They have also appeared in ten UEFA European Championships, winning the 1988 tournament in West Germany. Additionally, the team won a bronze medal at the Olympic football tournament in 1908, 1912 and 1920. The Netherlands has long-standing football rivalries with neighbours Belgium and Germany.\n\n\nThey are often regarded as the best team to never win the World Cup.[11][12][13][14][15]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the Netherlands national football team\n\n### Beginnings: 1905–1969[edit]\n\n\n![](image)1905 Netherlands team\nThe Netherlands played their first international match in Antwerp against Belgium on 30 April 1905, with the players selected by a five-member commission from the Dutch Football Association. After 90 minutes, the score was 1–1. As the match was for the Coupe van den Abeele, it went into extra-time, during which Eddy de Neve scored three times, making the score 4–1 for the Netherlands.[16] Some historians attribute one of the goals scored to Willem Hesselink.[17]\n\n\nIn 1908, the Netherlands competed in their first official tournament appearance at the Summer Olympic in London. They received a bronze medal after losing to Great Britain in the semi-finals, before defeating Sweden in the bronze medal match 2–0.[18] At the Olympic Games in 1912 and 1920, the Netherlands finished with the bronze medal as they lost to Denmark and Belgium in the respective tournament.[19][20]\n\n\n\n![](image)Netherlands make their way out to face Switzerland at the 1934 FIFA World Cup.\nThe Netherlands reached the semi-finals at the 1924 Summer Olympic in Paris after winning against Romania and Ireland. In the semi-finals, they gave up a one-goal lead, scored by Kees Pijl, to lose 2–1 versus Uruguay and were relegated to the third place playoff for the fourth time,[21] losing to Sweden in a replay.[22]\n\n\nAfter being eliminated in the first round at the 1928 Summer Olympic on home turf,[23] they skipped the first World Cup in 1930 due to the cost of travel from Europe to South America.[24] The team made their first appearance at a FIFA World Cup in 1934 where they took on Switzerland. Kick Smit was the first goalscorer for the Netherlands in a World Cup. The team was eliminated in the opening round by Switzerland 3–2.[25] A second appearance at the 1938 World Cup resulted in a first-round elimination against Czechoslovakia.[26]\n\n\nAfter the Second World War, the Netherlands qualified for only two international tournament before the 1970s: the 1948 Summer Olympic in Great Britain and the 1952 Summer Olympic in Finland. They suffered early elimination, losing to the hosts in 1948[27] and Brazil in 1952.[28]\n\n\n\n### Total football in the 1970s and first golden generation[edit]\n\n\nDuring the 1970s, total football (Dutch: *Totaalvoetbal*) was invented, pioneered by Ajax and led by playmaker Johan Cruyff and national team head coach Rinus Michels. The Netherlands made significant strides, qualifying for two World Cup finals in the decade. Carlos Alberto, captain of the Brazilian team that won the 1970 FIFA World Cup said, \"The only team I've seen that did things differently was Holland at the 1974 World Cup in West Germany. Since then everything looks more or less the same to me ... Their 'carousel' style of play was amazing to watch and marvelous for the game.\"[29]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Netherlands team before their 1–2 loss against West Germany in the finals of the 1974 World Cup\nIn 1974, the Netherlands beat both Brazil and Argentina in the second group stage, reaching the finals for the first time in their history. However, they lost to West Germany in the finals in Munich, despite having gone up 1–0 through Johan Neeskens' early penalty kick before a German had even touched the ball. However, a converted penalty by Paul Breitner and the winner from Gerd Müller, led to a victory for the German.[30]\n\n\nThe 1976 European Championship saw the Netherlands make their first European Championship. Czechoslovakia kept Cruyff and Van Hanegem within arms-length and defeated the Netherlands in extra time.[31] The Netherlands finished in third place after defeating the hosts (Yugoslavia) in extra time.[32]\n\n\nIn 1978, the Netherlands qualified for the World Cup in Argentina. The team was missing Johan Cruyff due to a kidnapping attempt,[33] and Willem van Hanegem. But the squad still had players like Jan Jongbloed, Wim Suurbier and Ruud Krol from the previous World Cup.[34] After finishing runners-up in Group 4 behind Peru, they recorded wins against Austria and Italy to set up a finals with Argentina. After a controversial start, with Argentina questioning the plaster cast on René van de Kerkhof's wrist, the match headed to extra time where the Netherlands lost 3–1 after two extra time goals from Mario Kempes and Daniel Bertoni.[35]\n\n\n\n### 1980s: Decline before European champions[edit]\n\n\nEuro '80 was the last tournament for which the Total Football team qualified. Despite the tournament format being expanded that year they did not advance past the group stage as they finished behind Czechoslovakia by goal difference.[36]\n\n\nVeterans such as Krol and Rensenbrink retired soon afterwards and the Netherlands hit a low point in their history: they missed the 1982 World Cup in Spain, Euro 1984 in France, and the 1986 World Cup in Mexico; they missed the French tournament by virtue of goals scored when Spain scored twelve in the final game against Malta. While both teams had the same goal difference (+16), Spain qualified having scored two more goals than the Netherlands.[37] During the qualification stage for the 1986 World Cup the Netherlands finished in second place and advanced to the playoffs against neighbours Belgium. After losing the first leg 1–0 in Brussels, they held a 2–0 lead at Rotterdam with a few minutes remaining. Georges Grün's header in the 84th minute resulted in the Netherlands' elimination as Belgium advanced to the World Cup on away goals.[38][39]\n\n\n\n![](image)The 1988 trophy on display in Amsterdam\n![](image)Rinus Michels\nRinus Michels returned, with his technical assistant Nol de Ruiter, to coach the team for Euro 1988 in West Germany. After losing the first group match against the Soviet Union 1–0, the Netherlands qualified for the semi-finals by defeating England 3–1 (with a hat-trick by Marco van Basten), and the Republic of Ireland 1–0. Van Basten scored against the hosts in the 89th minute to sink the German side, revenge for the 1974 World Cup.[40] The Netherlands won the finals with a victory over the USSR with a header by Ruud Gullit and a volley by Van Basten. This was the national team's first major tournament win.[41]\n\n\nThe Netherlands was one of the favourites for the 1990 World Cup tournament in Italy,[42] but they scored only two goals in the group stage which featured England, Egypt and the Republic of Ireland. After finishing the group stage with identical records, the Netherlands and the Republic of Ireland drew lots to determine which team would finish second. The Netherlands had the tougher draw against West Germany, while the Republic of Ireland faced Romania.[43] The match against West Germany is mostly remembered for the spitting incident involving Frank Rijkaard and Rudi Völler as the Netherlands were defeated 2–1.[40]\n\n\nThe team reached the semi-finals in the Euro 1992 in Sweden, known for the emergence of Dennis Bergkamp. They were eliminated by eventual champions Denmark when Peter Schmeichel saved Van Basten's kick in the penalty shootout.[44] This was Van Basten's last major tournament as he suffered a serious ankle injury shortly after, and eventually retired at age 30 in 1995. It was also the last hurrah for Rinus Michels, who returned for one finals spell in charge of the team before retiring for good after the tournament ended.\n\n\nDick Advocaat took over from Michels on the understanding that he would be replaced by Johan Cruyff the following year.[45] But after talks between Cruyff and the KNVB broke down, Advocaat remained in charge of the national team for the World Cup.[46] In the 1994 World Cup in the United States, Van Basten and striker Ruud Gullit were injured;[47] Dennis Bergkamp led the team with three goals and the Netherlands advanced to the quarter-finals, where they lost 3–2 to eventual champions Brazil.[48]\n\n\n\n### Second golden generation: 1996–2014[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Netherlands at Euro 96 match against Scotland at Villa Park stadium in Birmingham, England\nAfter finishing second in their Euro 1996 group, they played France in the quarter-finals. With the score 0-0, the match went to penalties. Clarence Seedorf's shot in the fourth round was stopped by French goalkeeper Bernard Lama, but the goal by Laurent Blanc eliminated the Netherlands.[49] After they finished top of the qualifying group, they were drawn in Group E of the 1998 World Cup. With the Netherlands team featuring Dennis Bergkamp, Marc Overmars, Phillip Cocu, Edgar Davids, Frank de Boer, Ronald de Boer and Patrick Kluivert, they reached the semi-finals where they again lost on penalties, this time to Brazil. They then lost the third place playoff to Croatia.[50][51] Soon afterwards, manager Guus Hiddink resigned to be replaced by Frank Rijkaard. The Netherlands co-hosted Euro 2000 with Belgium and won all three games in the group stage and then defeated FR Yugoslavia 6–1 in the quarter-finals. In the semi-finals, Italian goalkeeper Francesco Toldo made two penalty shootout saves to eliminate the Netherlands. The team failed to qualify for the 2002 World Cup after crucial losses to Portugal and the Republic of Ireland, prompting manager Louis van Gaal to resign.[52]\n\n\n\n![](image)Netherlands at the 2006 World Cup\nDick Advocaat became the national coach of the Netherlands for the second time in January 2002.[53] His first match was a 1–1 draw against England in Rotterdam.[54] The national team finished second place in their qualifying group for the 2004 Euro. Having to play in the playoffs after losing to the Czech Republic,[55] they knocked out Scotland with a 6–0 win in the second leg to qualify for the 2004 tournament.[56] The tournament saw the Netherlands make it to the semi-finals where they lost to the hosts in Portugal.[57] Heavy criticism of his handling of the national team lead Advocaat to quit.[58]\n\n\nThe Netherlands qualified for the 2006 World Cup under new manager Marco van Basten. They were eliminated in the second round after losing 1–0 to Portugal. The match produced 16 yellow cards, matching the World Cup record for most cautions in one game set in 2002, and set a new World Cup record of four red cards, two per side;[59] it was nicknamed \"the Battle of Nuremberg\" by the press.[60] Despite criticism surrounding his selection policy and the lack of attacking football from his team, Van Basten was offered a two-year extension to his contract by the KNVB. This allowed him to serve as national coach during Euro 2008 and the 2010 World Cup.[61] The Netherlands qualified for Euro 2008, where they were drawn in the \"Group of Death\", together with France, Italy and Romania.[62] They began with a 3–0 win over world champions Italy in Bern, their first victory over the Italians since 1978. They then beat France by 4–1 to qualify for the second round, and went on winning the group on nine points after beating Romania 2–0 with (mainly) their reserve players. However, they then lost in the quarter-finals to Guus Hiddink's Russia 3–1, with Ruud van Nistelrooy scoring an 86th-minute equaliser to force extra time, where the Russian scored twice. Following the tournament, Van Basten resigned having accepted the role at Ajax.[63]\n\n\n\n![](image)Netherlands – France at Euro 2008\n![](image)Netherlands – Denmark at the 2010 World Cup\nUnder new coach Bert van Marwijk, the Netherlands went on to secure a 100% record in their World Cup 2010 qualification campaign, winning all their eight games to qualify for the World Cup. After they had comfortably qualified with maximum points in Group E[64] and Slovakia[65] in the round of 16, they took on Brazil in the quarter-finals. After trailing 1–0 at half-time, Wesley Sneijder scored two goals in the second half to advance the team to the semis where they beat Uruguay 3–2.[66] They advanced to their first World Cup finals since 1978 but fell to Spain 1–0 after midfielder Andrés Iniesta scored in extra time.[67] From August to September 2011, the team was ranked number one in the FIFA World Ranking,[68] becoming the second national football team, after Spain, to top the ranking without previously winning a World Cup.\n\n\nFor Euro 2012, the Netherlands were placed in Group B with Germany, Portugal and Denmark, dubbed the tournament \"Group of Death\".[69] The Netherlands lost all three of their group matches in a tournament for the first time in their history. Netherlands football legend Johan Cruyff criticised the team's star players for poor build up play and sloppy execution of the easy passes.[70][71] Manager Bert van Marwijk resigned after the disappointment.[72]\n\n\nLouis van Gaal became the manager for the second time. In the 2014 World Cup UEFA qualifying round, the Netherlands won nine games and drew one, topping the group and earning automatic qualification. They were drawn into Group B, alongside Spain, Chile and Australia. The team avenged their 2010 defeat by defeating title holders Spain 5–1 in their opening match, with Robin van Persie scoring an impressive header to equalize in the 44th minute. Van Persie scored another, Arjen Robben scored a brace and Stefan de Vrij scored one.[73]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Netherlands team leaves the field after losing to Argentina at the 2014 World Cup.\nAfter finishing top of Group B, the Netherlands defeated Mexico 2–1 in the round of 16, with Wesley Sneijder equalising late in the match and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scoring a controversial penalty after a foul on Arjen Robben in stoppage time.[74] In the quarter-finals, where they faced Costa Rica, the Netherlands had many shots on goal but could not score; the match finished in a 0–0 draw after extra time. The Netherlands won the ensuing penalty shootout 4–3. This was due in large part to backup goalkeeper Tim Krul who was brought on just before the end of extra time and made two saves. This marked the first time in World Cup history a goalkeeper was brought onto the field solely to participate in a shootout.[75]\n\n\nThe semi-finals against Argentina saw the Netherlands having a decent chance to score from Arjen Robben while containing Lionel Messi as it remained scoreless after extra time. However, in penalty kicks, the Netherlands were eliminated 4–2, with Ron Vlaar and Wesley Sneijder having their spot kicks saved by Sergio Romero.[76] The Netherlands won the third place match against hosts Brazil. Van Gaal, who successfully motivated the team after their semi-finals elimination,[77] received praise for getting more out of the young and inexperienced Netherlands squad than many expected.[78][79]\n\n\n\n### Decline and recovery: 2014–present[edit]\n\n\nGuus Hiddink followed Van Gaal as manager for the Euro 2016 qualifying campaign. On 29 June 2015, Hiddink resigned and was succeeded by assistant Danny Blind. The Netherlands finished fourth in their group failing to qualify for the European Championship for the first time since 1984, and missing a major tournament for the first time since the 2002 World Cup.[80] The team's poor form continued into the 2018 World Cup qualifiers, eventually resulting in Blind being dismissed after a 2–0 defeat to Bulgaria in March 2017. After the return of Dick Advocaat as coach, the Netherlands failed to qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, finishing third in Group A behind France and Sweden.[81]\n\n\nIn February 2018, Advocaat was replaced by Ronald Koeman, on a contract until the summer of 2022.[82] The Netherlands qualified for League A in the UEFA Nations League which they would win to qualify for the final four after drawing with Germany on the last match day, beating France on the head-to-head record.[83] The Netherlands beat England in the semi-finals of the Nations League, but lost 1–0 in the final against Portugal.[84]\n\n\nThe Netherlands qualified for the UEFA Euro 2020 Championship on 16 November 2019 after drawing with Northern Ireland,[85] marking their tenth participation in the UEFA Euro championship. Following the qualification, Ronald Koeman resigned from the team to coach FC Barcelona, eventually to be succeeded by Frank de Boer.\n\n\nWithout Ronald Koeman in charge, the Netherlands struggled in the new Nations League season, where they joined Poland, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Italy. The Netherlands won 1–0 at home by courtesy of Steven Bergwijn after a difficult game where Poland played very defensive against the Netherlands.[86] However, also at the home ground, the Netherlands fell by the same score to Italy and lost their leading position to the Italians as well.[87] Eventually, the Netherlands improved, and obtained important wins over Bosnia at home and Poland away, but a disappointing away draw to Bosnia proved crucial. Despite a strong display in their last group match against Italy, the match in Bergamo resulted in yet another draw. The Netherlands came within a point of progressing but eventually failed to acquire the ticket for the 2021 UEFA Nations League Finals.[88][89][90][91]\n\n\nWith the coronavirus postponing Euro 2020 to 2021, the Netherlands played their group matches at home at the Johan Cruijff Arena in Amsterdam, beating Ukraine 3–2, Austria 2–0 and North Macedonia 3–0. However, the tournament ended in disappointment for the Netherlands once more, as they were beaten 2–0 by the Czech Republic in their Round of 16 tie in Budapest, after a Matthijs de Ligt red card. Two days later, De Boer left his position.[92] He was replaced by Louis van Gaal, who came out of retirement to return for a third spell in charge of the side.[93] On 16 November 2021, the Netherlands qualified for the 2022 World Cup after beating Norway 2–0 and topping their qualification group on the final day. In the 2022 World Cup, the Netherlands topped their group with 7 points. They progressed to the quarterfinals where they eventually lost to Argentina on penalties.[94]\n\n\n\n## Team image[edit]\n\n\n### Kits and crest[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Netherlands national football team kits.\n\n![](image)Dutch fans wearing the traditional orange colours at a 2006 World Cup match in Stuttgart\nThe Netherlands national football team famously plays in bright orange shirts. Orange is the historic national colour of the Netherlands, originating from one of the many title of the ruling head of state, Prince of Orange. The current Netherlands away shirt is blue. The lion on the crest is the Netherlands' national and royal animal and has been on the crest since 1907 when they won 3–1 over Belgium.[95]\n\n\nNike is the national team's kit provider, a sponsorship that began in 1996 and is contracted to continue until at least 2026.[96] Before that the team was supplied by Adidas and Lotto.[97]\n\n\n\n### Kit suppliers[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Kit supplier\n | Period\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![England](image) Umbro | 1966–1974\n |  |\n| ![Germany](image) Adidas | 1974–1990\n |  |\n| ![Italy](image) Lotto | 1991–1996\n |  |\n| ![United States](image) Nike | 1996–present\n |  |\n\n\n### Rivalries[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Germany–Netherlands football rivalry and Low Countries derby\n\nDeeply rooted in anti-German sentiment due to the occupation of the Netherlands by Germany during World War II, the Netherlands' long-time football rival is Germany. Beginning in 1974, when the Netherlands lost the 1974 World Cup to West Germany in the finals, the rivalry between the two nations has become one of the best-known in international football.[98][99]\n\n\nTo a lesser extent, the Netherlands maintains a rivalry with their other neighbour, Belgium; a Belgium–Netherlands fixture is referred to as a Low Countries derby. They have played in 126 matches as of May 2018[update] with the two competing against each other regularly between 1905 and 1964. This has diminished due to the rise of semi-professional football.[100]\n\n\nIn recent years, the Netherlands has also developed a intercontinental rivalry with Argentina.\n\n\n\n### Media coverage[edit]\n\n\nThe Netherlands national football team matches have broadcast on Nederlandse Omroep Stichting which includes all friendlies, Nations League and World Cup qualifiers. The newest contract is a seven-year deal until 2027.[101]\n\n\n\n## Home stadium[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Netherlands play most of their matches at Johan Cruyff Arena.\nThe Netherlands national team does not have a national stadium but plays mostly at the Johan Cruyff Arena in Amsterdam. It played host to its first Netherlands international game back in 1997, a 1998 World Cup qualification match against San Marino which the Netherlands won 4–0.[102] It was formally called the Amsterdam Arena until 2018 when it was renamed in memory of Johan Cruyff.[103]\n\n\nOver the last few years, De Kuip in Rotterdam has hosted matches more regularly. Occasionally, matches take place at Philips Stadion in Eindhoven and the De Grolsch Veste in Enschede.[104]\n\n\n\n## Results and fixtures[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Netherlands national football team results\n\nThe following is a list of match results in the last 12 months, as well as any future matches that have been scheduled.\n\n\n  Win\n  Draw\n  Loss\n  Fixture\n\n\n\n### 2022[edit]\n\n\nSenegal ![](image) v ![](image) Netherlands\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 21 November 2022 2022 FIFA World Cup Group A |  **Senegal ![](image)**  | **0–2** |  **![](image) Netherlands**  | Doha, Qatar |\n| 19:00 AST (UTC+3) |  | Report | * Gakpo ![](image) 84'\n* Klaassen ![](image) 90+9'\n | Stadium: Al Thumama StadiumAttendance: 41,721Referee: Wilton Sampaio (Brazil) |\n\nNetherlands ![](image) v ![](image) Ecuador\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 25 November 2022 2022 FIFA World Cup Group A |  **Netherlands ![](image)**  | **1–1** |  **![](image) Ecuador**  | Al Rayyan, Qatar |\n| 19:00 AST (UTC+3) | Gakpo ![](image) 6' | Report | Valencia ![](image) 49' | Stadium: Khalifa International StadiumAttendance: 44,833Referee: Mustapha Ghorbal (Algeria) |\n\nNetherlands ![](image) v ![](image) Qatar\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 29 November 2022 2022 FIFA World Cup Group A |  **Netherlands ![](image)**  | **2–0** |  **![](image) Qatar**  | Al Khor, Qatar |\n| 18:00 AST (UTC+3) | * Gakpo ![](image) 26'\n* F. de Jong ![](image) 49'\n | Report |  | Stadium: Al Bayt StadiumAttendance: 66,784Referee: Bakary Gassama (Gambia) |\n\nNetherlands ![](image) v ![](image) United States\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 3 December 2022 2022 FIFA World Cup R16 |  **Netherlands ![](image)**  | **3–1** |  **![](image) United States**  | Al Rayyan, Qatar |\n| 18:00 AST (UTC+3) | * Depay ![](image) 10'\n* Blind ![](image) 45+1'\n* Dumfries ![](image) 81'\n | Report | * Wright ![](image) 76'\n | Stadium: Khalifa International StadiumAttendance: 44,846Referee: Wilton Sampaio (Brazil) |\n\nNetherlands ![](image) v ![](image) Argentina\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 9 December 2022 2022 FIFA World Cup QF |  **Netherlands ![](image)**  | **2–2** (a.e.t.)

them lose their first round matches to Switzerland (1934) and Czechoslovakia (1938).[111][112]\n\n\nAfter not qualifying for the next six World Cups, they qualified for the 1974 FIFA World Cup in West Germany. There, with the use of Total Football tactics, they recorded their first win in World Cup competition against Uruguay. They qualified through to the second round where a win on the finals match day secured the Netherlands a spot in the finals. They lost to West Germany 2–1 with Gerd Müller scoring the winning goal for the Germany.[30] The Netherlands once again made the 1978 FIFA World Cup finals with the team finishing second in the group behind Peru. After finishing top of the all-European group in the second round, they met Argentina in the finals. Argentina protested René van de Kerkhof's forearm plaster cast. After that protest, the game went to extra time where Argentina won 3–1 after scoring two goals in extra time.[35]\n\n\nThe 1990 edition saw the Netherlands not win a single game throughout the tournament, scoring only two goals in the group stage. After finishing with an identical record with the Republic of Ireland, they were split by drawing of lots. The Netherlands took on West Germany losing 2–1 in Milan.[43][113] 1994 saw the Netherlands knocked out in the quarter-finals stage as they lost to eventual champions Brazil with Branco's brutal free-kick sending them out.[48] After qualifying from their group with five points, the Netherlands made the semi-finals of the 1998 edition where they once again lost to the Brazilians. This time it was by penalties; Phillip Cocu and Ronald de Boer's shots missed the goal to give Brazil a spot in the finals. The Netherlands went on to finish in fourth place after losing to Croatia in the third place playoff.[114]\n\n\nIn 2006, the Netherlands made it to the round of 16 where, in what was called the \"Battle of Nuremberg\" they lost by a single goal to Portugal. The Netherlands were given seven yellow cards.[60] The following edition, in 2010, saw the team qualify to the knockout stage by finishing atop Group E. After defeating Slovakia 2–1 in the round of 16, they came back from an early goal by Robinho to defeat Brazil 2–1 in the quarter-finals as Wesley Sneijder scored a double.[65][66] In the semi-finals, they defeated Uruguay in a tough game for the Netherlands, making their first World Cup finals since 1978.[115] In the finals, they took on Spain. During normal time, the Netherlands had chances to win the game, the closest being in the 62nd minute when Sneijder shot wide. Spain's winning goal came off a play in the 116th minute after the Netherlands went down to ten men.[116][67]\n\n\nIn 2014, the Netherlands finish atop Group B with wins over Spain, Australia and Chile.[117] In the round of 16 match against Mexico, the Netherlands came back from a goal down to manage a 2–1 win in stoppage time with Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scoring a controversial penalty.[74] In the quarter-finals, they defeated Costa Rica on penalties however they lost to Argentina on penalties in the semi-finals. The Netherlands took bronze in the tournament after defeating hosts nations Brazil 3–0 in the third place playoff.[75][118]\n\n\n  **Champions**    **Runners-up**    **Third place**    Fourth

In the Netherlands, however, professional football was not introduced until 1954. Before then, players who left the Netherlands to turn pro in another country were banned from the national team.\n2. **^** Match will be played at Estádio Algarve, Faro/Loulé, Portugal, due to the redevelopment of Victoria Stadium, Gibraltar.[105]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Holland's media-friendly football pros\".

The latter two were absorbed along with their records;[13][14] the present team represents the reunified Federal Republic. The official name and code \"Germany FR (FRG)\" was shortened to \"Germany (GER)\" following reunification in 1990.\n\n\nGermany is one of the most successful national teams in international competitions, having won four World Cups (1954, 1974, 1990, 2014), tied with Italy, and only one less than the most successful team, Brazil. Having won three European Championships (1972, 1980, 1996) Germany is along with Spain the record holder in that international competition. Germany won also a Confederations Cup (2017).[11] They have also been runners-up at the European Championship three times, and four times at the World Cup, with a further four third-place finishes at the World Cup.[11] East Germany won Olympic Gold in 1976.[15] Germany is one of only two nations to have won both the FIFA World Cup and the FIFA Women's World Cup (the other being Spain).[16][17] By combined World Cups, Germany stands as the most successful football nation in history with six World Cups – four for the men's team and two for the women's. At the end of the 2014 World Cup, Germany earned the second highest Elo rating of any national football team in history, with 2,223 points.[18] Germany is also the only European nation that has won a FIFA World Cup in the Americas.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the Germany national football team\n\n### Early years (1899–1942)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Germany national team at its first official international match in 1908\nOn 18 April 1897, an early international game on German soil was played in Hamburg when a selection team from the Danish Football Association defeated a selection team from the Hamburg-Altona Football Association, 5–0.[19][20]\n\n\nBetween 1899 and 1901, prior to the formation of a national team, there were five international matches between Germany and English selection teams, which are today not recognised as official by either nation's football association (in part because England fielded their amateur side, which was an overflow or B team). All five matches ended in large defeats for the Germany teams, including a 12–0 loss at White Hart Lane in September 1901.[21] Eight years after the establishment of the German Football Association (DFB) in 1900, the first official match of the Germany national football team[d] was played on 5 April 1908, against Switzerland in Basel, with the Swiss winning 5–3.[7] A follow-up to the earlier series between England Amateurs and Germany occurred in March 1909 at Oxford's White House Ground[22] and resulted in Germany's largest official defeat to date: 9–0 (this time, the match was recognised and recorded as official by the DFB but not by the FA, again due to the amateur side being fielded).[21] These early confrontations formed the beginning of the rich rivalry between the two teams: one of the longest and most enduring international rivalries in football.[23]\n\n\nJulius Hirsch was the first Jewish player to represent the Germany national football team, which he joined in 1911.[24][25] Hirsch scored four goals for Germany against the Netherlands in 1912, becoming the first German to score four goals in a single match.[26][27]\n\n\n\n![](image)Gottfried Fuchs\nGottfried Fuchs scored a world record 10 goals for Germany in a 16–0 win against Russia at the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm on 1 July, becoming the top scorer of the tournament; his international record was not surpassed until 2001 when Australia's Archie Thompson scored 13 goals in a 31–0 defeat of American Samoa.[28] He was Jewish, and the German Football Association erased all references to him from their records between 1933 and 1945.[29][30] As of 2016, he was still the top German scorer for one match.[31]\n\n\nAt that time the players were selected by the DFB, as there was no dedicated coach. The first manager of the Germany national team was Otto Nerz, a school teacher from Mannheim, who served in the role from 1926 to 1936.[32] The German FA could not afford travel to Uruguay for the first World Cup staged in 1930 during the Great Depression, but finished third in the 1934 World Cup in their first appearance in the competition. After a poor showing at the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin, Sepp Herberger became coach. In 1937 he put together a squad which was soon nicknamed the *Breslau Elf* (the Breslau Eleven) in recognition of their 8–0 win over Denmark in the then German city of Breslau, Lower Silesia (now Wrocław, Poland).[33][34]\n\n\nAfter Austria became part of Germany in the *Anschluss* of March 1938, the Austrian national team – one of Europe's best sides at the time due to professionalism – was disbanded despite having already qualified for the 1938 World Cup. Nazi politicians ordered five or six ex-Austrian players, from the clubs Rapid Vienna, Austria Vienna, and First Vienna FC, to join the \"all-German\" team on short notice in a staged show of unity for political reasons. At the 1938 World Cup in France, this \"united\" Germany national team managed only a 1–1 draw against Switzerland and then lost the replay 2–4 in front of a hostile crowd in Paris. That early exit stands as Germany's worst World Cup result, and one of just three occasions the team failed to progress from the group stage – the next would not occur until the 2018 tournament, and it would be repeated in 2022.\n\n\nDuring World War II, the team played over 30 international games between September 1939 and November 1942. National team games were then suspended, as most players had to join the armed forces. Many of the national team players were gathered together under coach Herberger as *Rote Jäger* through the efforts of a sympathetic air force officer trying to protect the footballers from the most dangerous wartime service.\n\n\n\n### Three Germany national teams (1945–1990)[edit]\n\n\nAfter World War II, Germany was banned from competition in most sports until 1950. The DFB was not a full member of FIFA, and none of the three new German states – West Germany, East Germany, and Saarland – entered the 1950 World Cup qualifiers.\n\n\nThe Federal Republic of Germany, which was referred to as West Germany, continued the DFB. With recognition by FIFA and UEFA, the DFB maintained and continued the record of the pre-war team. Switzerland was the first team that played West Germany in 1950,[35] with the latter qualifying for the 1954 World Cup and the former hosting it.\n\n\nThe Saarland, a French protectorate between 1947 and 1956, did not join French organisations, and was barred from participating in pan-German ones. It sent their own team to the 1952 Summer Olympics and to the 1954 World Cup qualifiers. In 1957, Saarland acceded to the Federal Republic of Germany.\n\n\nIn 1949, the communist German Democratic Republic (East Germany) was founded. In 1952 the *Deutscher Fußball-Verband der DDR* (DFV) was established and the East Germany national football team took to the field. They were the only team to beat the 1974 FIFA World Cup winning West Germans in the only meeting of the two sides of the divided nation. East Germany won the gold medal at the 1976 Olympics. After German reunification in 1990, the eastern football competition was reintegrated into the DFB.\n\n\n\n### 1954 World Cup victory[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1954 FIFA World Cup final\n\n![](image)Helmut Rahn scored the winning goal in the 1954 FIFA World Cup final.\nWest Germany, captained by Fritz Walter, met in the 1954 World Cup against Turkey, Yugoslavia and Austria. When playing favourites Hungary in the group stage, West Germany lost 3–8, and faced the Hungarian \"Mighty Magyars\" again in the final. Hungary had gone unbeaten for 32 consecutive matches, and West Germany snapped the streak by winning 3–2, with Helmut Rahn scoring the winning goal.[36] The success is called \"The Miracle of Bern\" (*Das Wunder von Bern*).[37]\n\n\n\n### Memorable losses: Wembley goal and game of the century (1958–1970)[edit]\n\n\nAfter finishing fourth in the 1958 World Cup and reaching only the quarter-finals in the 1962 World Cup, the DFB made changes. Professionalism was introduced, and the best clubs from the various Regionalligas were assembled into the new Bundesliga. In 1964, Helmut Schön took over as coach, replacing Herberger who had been in office for 28 years.\n\n\nIn the 1966 World Cup, West Germany reached the final after beating the USSR in the semi-final, facing hosts England. In extra time, the first goal by Geoff Hurst was one of the most contentious goals in the history of the World Cup: the linesman signalled the ball had crossed the line for a goal, after bouncing down from the crossbar, when replays showed it did not appear to have fully crossed the line. Hurst then scored another goal giving England a 4–2 win.[38][39]\n\n\nWest Germany in the 1970 World Cup knocked England out in the quarter-finals 3–2, before they suffered a 4–3 extra-time loss in the semi-final against Italy. This match with five goals in extra time is one of the most dramatic in World Cup history, and is called the \"Game of the Century\" in both Italy and Germany.[40][41] West Germany claimed third by beating Uruguay 1–0. Gerd Müller finished as the tournament's top scorer with 10 goals.\n\n\n\n### 1974 World Cup title on home soil[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1974 FIFA World Cup\n\n![](image)The 1974 FIFA World Cup Final on 7 July, in Munich's Olympiastadion\nIn 1971, Franz Beckenbauer became captain of the national team, and he led West Germany to victory at the European Championship at Euro 1972, defeating the Soviet Union 3–0 in the final.[42][43]\n\n\nAs hosts of the 1974 World Cup, they won their second World Cup, defeating the Netherlands 2–1 in the final in Munich.[44]\nTwo matches in the 1974 World Cup stood out for West Germany. The first group stage saw a politically charged match as West Germany played a game against East Germany. The East Germans won 1–0 but it made a scant difference to West Germany as the West Germans advanced to the knockout stage.[45] The West Germans advanced to the final against the Johan Cruijff-led Dutch team and their brand of \"Total Football\". The Dutch took the lead from a penalty. However, West Germany tied the match on a penalty by Paul Breitner, and won it with Gerd Müller's fine finish soon after.[46][47]\n\n\n\n### Late 1970s and early 1980s[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gerd Müller in 1974\nWest Germany failed to defend their titles in the next two major international tournaments. They lost to Czechoslovakia in the UEFA Euro 1976 final in a penalty shootout 5–3,[48] their last penalty shootout loss in a major tournament as of 2022.[49]\n\n\nIn the 1978 World Cup, Germany was eliminated in the second group stage after losing 3–2 to Austria. Schön retired as coach afterward, and the post was taken over by his assistant, Jupp Derwall.\n\n\nWest Germany's first tournament under Derwall was successful, as they earned their second European title at Euro 1980 after defeating Belgium 2–1 in the final.[50] West Germany started the 1982 World Cup with a 1–2 upset by newcomers Algeria in their first match,[51] but advanced to the second round with a controversial 1–0 win over Austria. In the semi-final against France, they tied the match 3–3 and won the penalty shootout 5–4.[52][53] In the final, they were defeated by Italy 1–3.[54]\n\n\nDuring this period, West Germany's Gerd Müller racked up fourteen goals in two World Cups (1970 and 1974). His ten goals in 1970 are the third-most ever in a tournament. Müller's all-time World Cup record of 14 goals was broken by Ronaldo in 2006; this was then further broken by Miroslav Klose in 2014 with 16 goals.[55]\n\n\n\n### Beckenbauer's managing success (1984–1990)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Franz Beckenbauer in 1990\nAfter West Germany were eliminated in the first round of Euro 1984, Franz Beckenbauer returned to the national team to replace Derwall as manager.[56] At the 1986 World Cup in Mexico, West Germany finished as runners-up for the second consecutive tournament after beating France 2–0 in the semi-finals, but losing to the Diego Maradona-led Argentina in the final, 2–3.[57][58] In Euro 1988, after drawing Italy 1–1 and beating both Denmark and Spain 2–0 in the group stage,[59] West Germany's hopes of winning the tournament on home soil were spoiled by the Netherlands, as the Dutch beat them 2–1 in the semi-finals.[60][61]\n\n\nAt the 1990 World Cup in Italy, West Germany won their third World Cup title, in its unprecedented third consecutive final appearance.[62] Captained by Lothar Matthäus, they defeated Yugoslavia (4–1), UAE (5–1), the Netherlands (2–1), Czechoslovakia (1–0), and England (1–1, 4–3 on penalty kicks) on the way to a final rematch against Argentina in Rome.[63][64] West Germany won 1–0, with the only goal being a penalty scored in the 85th minute by Andreas Brehme.[62] Beckenbauer, who won the World Cup as the national team's captain in 1974, thus became the first person to win the World Cup as both captain and manager,[56] and the second to win as player and manager, after Mario Zagallo of Brazil.\n\n\n\n### Olympic football[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Germany Olympic football team\n\n\n\n| Medal record\n |\n| --- |\n| Summer Olympic Games |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) | 1976 Montreal | Team |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) | 1980 Moscow | Team |\n| ![Bronze medal – third place](image) | 1964 Tokyo | Team |\n| ![Bronze medal – third place](image) | 1972 Munich | Team |\n| ![Bronze medal – third place](image) | 1988 Seoul | Team |\n\n\nEast Germany did however achieve significantly greater success in Olympic football than the amateur teams fielded by the Western NOC of Germany due to using its elite players from the top domestic league. In 1956, 1960, and 1964 both states had sent a United Team of Germany. For 1964, the East German side had beaten their Western counterparts in order to be selected. They went on to win the bronze medal for Germany. As GDR, they won bronze in 1972 in Munich, gold in 1976 in Montreal, and silver in 1980 in Moscow.\n\n\nPrior to 1984, Olympic football was an amateur event, meaning that only non-professional players could participate.[e] Due to this, West Germany was never able to achieve the same degree of success at the Olympics as at the World Cup. The first medal coming in the 1988 Olympics, when they won the bronze medal after beating Italy 3–0 in the 3rd place match.[65] West Germany also reached the second round in both 1972 and 1984. On the other hand, due to having an ability to field its top-level players who were classified as amateurs on a technicality East Germany did better, winning a gold, a silver and two bronze medals (one representing the United Team of Germany).\n\n\n\n### Berti Vogts years (1990–1998)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Berti Vogts\nIn February 1990, months after the fall of the Berlin Wall, East Germany and West Germany were drawn together in UEFA Euro 1992 qualifying Group 5. In November 1990, the East German association Deutscher Fußball-Verband integrated into the DFB, by which time the East Germany team had ceased operations, playing its last match on 12 September 1990. The unified Germany national team completed the European Championship qualifying group. The East German 1990–91 league continued, with a restructuring of German leagues in 1991–92. The first game with a unified Germany national team was against Switzerland on 19 December.[66]\n\n\nAfter the 1990 World Cup, assistant Berti Vogts took over as the national team coach from the retiring Beckenbauer. In Euro 1992, Germany reached the final, but lost 0–2 to underdogs Denmark.[67]\nIn the 1994 World Cup, they were upset 1–2 in the quarterfinals by Bulgaria.[68][69]\n\n\nReunified Germany won its first major international title at Euro 1996, becoming European champions for the third time.[70] They defeated hosts England in the semi-finals,[71] and the Czech Republic 2–1 in the final on a golden goal in extra time.[72]\n\n\nHowever, in the 1998 World Cup, Germany were eliminated in the quarterfinals in a 0–3 defeat to Croatia, all goals being scored after defender Christian Wörns received a straight red card.[73] Vogts stepped down afterwards and was replaced by Erich Ribbeck.[74]\n\n\n\n### Erich Ribbeck and Rudi Völler years (2000–2004)[edit]\n\n\nIn Euro 2000, the team went out in the first round, drawing with Romania, then suffering a 1–0 defeat to England and were routed 3–0 by Portugal (which fielded their backup players, having already advanced).[75] Ribbeck resigned, and was replaced by Rudi Völler.[76]\n\n\nComing into the 2002 World Cup, expectations of Germany were low due to poor results in the qualifiers, and not directly qualifying for the finals for the first time. The team advanced through group play, and in the knockout stages they produced three consecutive 1–0 wins against Paraguay,[77] the United States,[78] and co-hosts South Korea. Oliver Neuville scored two minutes from time against Paraguay and Michael Ballack scored both goals in the US and South Korea games, although he picked up a second yellow card against South Korea for a tactical foul and was suspended for the subsequent match.[79] This set up a final against Brazil, the first World Cup meeting between the two. Germany lost 0–2 thanks to two Ronaldo goals.[80] Nevertheless, German captain and goalkeeper Oliver Kahn won the Golden Ball,[81] the first time in the World Cup that a goalkeeper was named the best player of the tournament.[82]\n\n\n\n![](image)Fans watching Germany play against Argentina in the 2006 World Cup match at the Donau Arena in Regensburg\nGermany again exited in the first round of Euro 2004, drawing their first two matches and losing the third to the Czech Republic (who had fielded a second-string team).[83] Völler resigned afterwards, and Jürgen Klinsmann was appointed head coach.[84][85]\n\n\n\n### Resurgence under Klinsmann (2004–2006)[edit]\n\n\nKlinsmann's main task was to lead the national team to a good showing at the 2006 World Cup in Germany. He relieved goalkeeper Kahn of the captaincy and announced that Kahn and longtime backup Jens Lehmann would be competing for the position of starting goaltender, a decision that angered Kahn and Lehmann eventually won that contest.[86] Expectations for the team were low, which was not helped by veteran defender Christian Wörns being dropped (after Wörns criticised Klinsmann for designating him only as a backup player on the squad), a choice roundly panned in Germany. Italy routed Germany 4–1 in a March 2006 exhibition game, and Klinsmann bore the brunt of the criticism as the team was ranked only 22nd in the world entering the 2006 World Cup.[87]\n\n\nAs World Cup hosts, Germany won all three group stage matches to finish top of their group. The team defeated Sweden 2–0 in the round of 16,[88]\nand Argentina in the quarter-finals in a penalty shootout.[89][90][91] The semi-final against Italy was scoreless until near the end of extra time when Germany conceded two goals.[92]\nIn the third place match, Germany defeated Portugal 3–1.[93]\nMiroslav Klose was awarded the Golden Boot for his tournament-leading five goals.[94]\n\n\n\n### Löw era (2006–2021)[edit]\n\n\n#### Euro 2008, 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: UEFA Euro 2008, 2010 FIFA World Cup, and UEFA Euro 2012\n\nGermany's entry into the Euro 2008 qualifying round was marked by the promotion of Joachim Löw to head coach, since Klinsmann resigned.[95]\nAt UEFA Euro 2008, Germany won two out of three matches in group play to advance to the knockout round.[96]\nThey defeated Portugal 3–2 in the quarterfinal,[97]\nand won their semi-final against Turkey.[98]\nGermany lost the final against Spain 0–1, finishing as the runners-up.[99]\n\n\nIn the 2010 World Cup, Germany won the group and advanced to the knockout stage. In the round of 16, Germany defeated England 4–1.[100] The game controversially had a valid goal by Frank Lampard disallowed.[101][102][103] In the quarter-finals, Germany defeated Argentina 4–0,[104] and Miroslav Klose tied German Gerd Müller's record of 14 World Cup goals.[105]\nIn the semi-final, Germany lost 1–0 to Spain.[106] Germany defeated Uruguay 3–2 to take third place (their second third place after 2006).[107] German Thomas Müller won the Golden Boot and the Best Young Player Award.[108][109]\n\n\n\n![](image)Germany during Euro 2012 qualifiers\nIn Euro 2012, Germany was placed in group B along with Portugal, Netherlands, and Denmark. Germany won all three group matches. Germany defeated Greece in the quarter-final and set a record of 15 consecutive wins in all competitive matches.[110] In the semi-finals, Germany lost to Italy, 1–2.\n\n\n\n#### 2014 World Cup victory[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 FIFA World Cup\n\n![](image)Germany lifting the World Cup trophy in 2014\nGermany were placed in Group G of the 2014 World Cup,[111] with Portugal, Ghana, and the United States. They first faced Portugal in a match billed by some as the \"team of all the talents against the team of The Talent (Cristiano Ronaldo)\", routing the Portuguese 4–0 thanks to a hat-trick by Thomas Müller.[112][113] In their match with Ghana, they led the game with Götze's second half goal, but then conceded two consecutive goals. Klose scored a goal to level Germany 2–2, his 15th World Cup goal to join former Brazil striker Ronaldo at the pinnacle of World Cup Finals scorers. They then went on to defeat the Klinsmann-led United States 1–0, securing them a spot in the round of sixteen against Algeria.\n\n\nThe round of sixteen knockout match against Algeria remained goalless after regulation time, resulting in extra time. In the 92nd minute, André Schürrle scored a goal from a Thomas Müller pass. Mesut Özil scored Germany's second goal in the 120th minute. Algeria managed to score one goal in injury time and the match ended 2–1. Germany secured a place in the quarter-final, where they would face France.\n\n\nIn the quarter-final match against France, Mats Hummels scored in the 13th minute. Germany won the game 1–0 to advance to a record fourth consecutive semi-finals.[114]\n\n\n\n![](image)Germany posing with Champions banner after 2014 FIFA World Cup Final\nThe 7–1 semi-final win against Brazil was one of the most memorable games in World Cup history; Germany scored four goals in just less than seven minutes and were 5–0 up by the 30th minute with goals from Thomas Müller, Miroslav Klose, Sami Khedira and two from Toni Kroos. Germany's 7–0 in the second half was the highest score against Brazil in a single game. Germany conceded a late goal to Brazil's Oscar. It was Brazil's worst ever World Cup defeat,[115] whilst Germany broke multiple World Cup records with the win, including the record broken by Klose, the first team to reach four consecutive World Cup semi-finals, the first team to score seven goals in a World Cup Finals knockout phase game, the fastest five consecutive goals in World Cup history (four of which in just 400 seconds), and the first team to score five goals in the first half in a World Cup semi-final.[116]\n\n\nThe World Cup final was held at the Maracana in Rio de Janeiro on 13 July, and billed as the world's best player (Lionel Messi) versus the world's best team (Germany).[117][118] Mario Götze's 113th-minute goal helped Germany beat Argentina 1–0, becoming the first-ever European team to win a FIFA World Cup in the Americas and the second European team to win the title outside Europe.[119][120]\n\n\n\n#### Euro 2016 to 2017 Confederations Cup[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: UEFA Euro 2016 and 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup\n\nAfter several players retired from the team following the 2014 World Cup win, including Philipp Lahm, Per Mertesacker and Miroslav Klose, the team had a disappointing start in the UEFA Euro 2016 qualifiers. They defeated Scotland 2–1 at home, then suffered a 2–0 loss at Poland (the first in their history), a 1–1 draw against the Republic of Ireland, and a 4–0 win over Gibraltar. The year ended with an away 1–0 friendly win against Spain.\n\n\nTroubles during qualifying for the 2016 European Championship continued, drawing at home, as well as losing away, to Ireland; the team also only narrowly defeated Scotland on two occasions, but handily won the return against Poland and both games against Gibraltar (who competed for the first time). They would eventually win their group and qualify for the tournament through a 2–1 victory against Georgia on 11 October 2015.\n\n\nOn 13 November 2015, Germany played a friendly against France in Paris when a series of terrorist attacks took place in the city, some in the direct vicinity of the Stade de France, where the game was held.[121] For security reasons, the team spent the night inside the stadium, accompanied by the French squad who stayed behind in an act of comradery.[122] Four days later, Germany was scheduled to face the Netherlands at Hanover's HDI-Arena, in another friendly. After initial security reservations, the DFB decided to play the match on 15 November.[123] After reports about a concrete threat to the stadium, the match was cancelled 90 minutes before kickoff.[124]\n\n\nGermany began their campaign for a fourth European title with a 2–0 win against Ukraine on 12 June 2016. Against Poland, Germany was held to a 0–0 draw but concluded Group C play with a 1–0 win against Northern Ireland. In the Round of 16, Germany faced Slovakia and earned a comfortable 3–0 win. Germany then faced off against rivals Italy in the quarter-finals. Mesut Özil opened the scoring in the 65th minute for Germany, before Leonardo Bonucci drew even after converting a penalty in the 78th minute. The score remained 1–1 after extra time, and Germany beat Italy 6–5 in a penalty shootout. It was the first time Germany had overcome Italy in a major tournament.[125][126] The Germans lost to hosts France 2–0 in the semi-finals, their first competitive win against Germany in 58 years.[127]\n\n\nGermany qualified for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup after winning the 2014 World Cup, and won the last version of the Confederations Cup after a 1–0 win against Chile in the final at the Krestovsky Stadium in Saint Petersburg, Russia.[128]\n\n\n\n#### Disappointment at the 2018 World Cup, 2018–19 UEFA Nations League and Euro 2020[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fans in Hamburg watching the match between Germany and South Korea\nMain articles: 2018 FIFA World Cup, 2018–19 UEFA Nations League, and UEFA Euro 2020\n\nAfter winning all their qualifying matches and the Confederations Cup the previous year, Germany started their 2018 World Cup campaign with a defeat to Mexico, their first loss in an opening match since the 1982 World Cup.[129] Germany defeated Sweden 2–1 in their second game via an injury-time winner from Toni Kroos, but was subsequently eliminated following a 2–0 loss to South Korea, their first exit in the first round since 1938 and first in the group stage since the format had been reintroduced in 1950. With this result Germany became the fifth defending champions to be eliminated in the group stages of the World Cup, following Brazil in 1966, France in 2002, Italy in 2010, and Spain in 2014.[130][131]\n\n\nFollowing the World Cup, Germany's struggles continued into the inaugural UEFA Nations League. After a 0–0 draw at home against France, they lost 3–0 against the Netherlands[132] and 1–2 in the rematch against France three days later; the latter result being their fourth loss in six competitive matches.[133] These results meant that Germany could not advance to the 2019 UEFA Nations League Finals and faced the prospect of possible relegation to League B in the next Nations League.[133]\n\n\nAfter the Netherlands' win against France, the relegation to League B was originally confirmed, but due to the overhaul of the format for the 2020–21 UEFA Nations League, Germany was spared from relegation to League B.[134]\n\n\nIn March 2021, the DFB announced that Löw would step down as Germany's manager after Euro 2021.[135] Later that month, Germany lost 1–2 at home to North Macedonia in the 2022 World Cup qualifiers, their first World Cup qualification defeat since losing 5–1 to England in the 2002 World Cup qualifiers and only their third in history.[136] On 25 May 2021, the DFB announced that former assistant manager Hansi Flick will replace Löw as head coach.[137]\n\n\nAt Euro 2020 (delayed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic), Germany were drawn with World Cup champions France (to whom they lost 1–0) and reigning European champions Portugal (whom they defeated 4–2, albeit with the help of two Portuguese own goals), with each group having only two guaranteed qualifiers for the next phase, plus a chance for the third-placed team. In the final group match, the Hungarians took the lead twice only to draw. Germany then lost 2–0 to England in the round of 16, their first round of 16 exit in a major tournament since the 1938 World Cup.[138]\n\n\n\n### New era (2021–2023)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)\n\nFollowing Germany's disappointment at Euro 2020, Hansi Flick, former Bayern Munich manager, took over as coach of the national team. Success only followed from there, as Germany went on to beat Liechtenstein, Armenia, Iceland, Romania and North Macedonia in a month's succession. On 11 October 2021, Germany beat North Macedonia 4–0 to become the first team (outside of the hosts) to qualify for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.[139]\n\n\nIn the 2022–23 Nations League, Germany recorded their first-ever competitive win against Italy as the Germans beat the visitors 5–2. This was Germany's fourth game and first win in the league, however the Germans finished third in the group.[140]\n\n\nIn the 2022 World Cup, Germany were drawn into Group E with Spain, Japan and Costa Rica. The campaign started with a shock 2–1 defeat to Japan.[141] Germany drew 1–1 with Spain,[142] and then were knocked out of the World Cup in the group stage for the second consecutive tournament, despite a 4–2 win over Costa Rica, missing out on a place in the knockout stages on goal difference.[143]\n\n\nAfter several poor performances following Germany's World Cup exit – including a 1–4 home loss to Japan – Flick was dismissed on 10 September 2023, while Rudi Völler took interim charge of the team, leading the team to a 2–1 victory over France.[144]\n\n\nOn 22 September 2023, Julian Nagelsmann was named the new head coach.[145]\n\n\n\n## Team image[edit]\n\n\n### Kits and crest[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Germany national football team kits.\n\n![](image)The 2006 World Cup saw a widespread public display of the German national flag.\nThe national team's home kit has been traditionally a white shirt, black shorts, and white socks. The colours are derived from the 19th-century flag of the North German State of Prussia.[146] Since 1988, many of the home kit's designs incorporate details patterned after the modern German flag. For the 2014 World Cup, Germany's kit was white shorts rather than the traditional black due to FIFA's kit clashing rule for the tournament.[147] The away shirt colour has changed several times. Historically, a green shirt with white shorts is the most often used alternative colour combination, derived from the DFB colours – though it is often erroneously reported that the choice is in recognition of the fact that Ireland, whose home shirts are green, were the first nation to play Germany in a friendly game after World War II. However, the first team to play Germany after WWII, as stated above, was actually Switzerland.[148] Other colours such as red, grey and black have also been used.\n\n\nA change from black to red came in 2005 on the request of Jürgen Klinsmann,[149] but Germany played every game at the 2006 World Cup in its home white colours. In 2010, the away colours then changed back to a black shirt and white shorts, but at the World Cup, the team dressed up in the black shorts from the home kit. The kit used by Germany returned to a green shirt on its away kit, but then changed again to red-and-black striped shirts with white stripes and letters and black shorts.\n\n\nAdidas AG is the longstanding kit provider to the national team, a sponsorship that began in 1954 and is contracted to continue until at least 2022.[150] In the 70s, Germany wore Erima kits (a German brand, formerly a subsidiary of Adidas).[151][26]\n\n\nAs a common practice, three stars were added above the crest in 1996, symbolising Germany's World Cup titles in 1954, 1974 and 1990. In 2014, a fourth star was added after Germany were crowned world champions for the fourth time.\n\n\n\n#### Kit suppliers[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Kit supplier\n | Period\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Leuzela\n | unknown–1954\n | Germany wore Leuzela kits during the 1954 FIFA World Cup[152] |\n| ![](image) Umbro | 1966–1970\n | Germany wore Umbro kits during the 1966 and 1970 FIFA World Cups[153] |\n| ![](image) Adidas | 1954–present\n | In the 1970s, Germany wore Erima kits(a German brand, formerly a subsidiary of Adidas).[154][26] |\n\n\n#### Kit deals[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | This list is incomplete; you can help by adding missing items. *(June 2018)*\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Kit supplier\n | Period\n | Contract\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Announcement\n | Duration\n |\n| ![](image) Adidas | 1954–present\n | 20 June 2016\n | 2019–2022 (4 years)[155] | Per year: €50 million ($56.7 million) Total: €250 million ($283.5 million)[156][157] |\n| 10 September 2018\n | 2023–2026 (4 years)\n | Undisclosed[158] |\n\n\n### Home stadium[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Olympic Stadium in Berlin\nGermany plays its home matches among various stadiums, in rotation, around the country. They have played home matches in 43 different cities so far, including venues that were German at the time of the match, such as Vienna, Austria, which staged three games between 1938 and 1942.\n\n\nNational team matches have been held most often in Berlin (46 matches), which was the venue of Germany's first home match (in 1908 against England). Other common host cities include Hamburg (34 matches), Stuttgart (32), Hanover (28) and Dortmund. Munich also hosted noteworthy matches including the 1974 World Cup final.\n\n\n\n### Media coverage[edit]\n\n\nGermany's qualifying and friendly matches are televised by privately owned RTL; Nations

statistics\n\n* 1930–1938 as ![](image) → ![](image) → ![](image) Germany\n* 1950–1990 as ![](image) West Germany\n* 1994–present as ![](image) Germany\n\n\n  **Champions**    **Runners-up**    Third place     Tournament played fully or partially on home soil  \n\n\nGermany has won the FIFA World Cup four times, behind only Brazil's five.[170] It has finished as runners-up four times.[170] In terms of semi-final appearances, Germany leads with 13, two more than Brazil's 11, who have participated in every single tournament.[170] From 1954 to 2014 (16 tournaments), Germany reached at least the stage of the last eight teams, before being eliminated in the group stage in 2018.[170] Germany has also qualified for every one of the 19 World Cups for which it has entered – it did not enter the inaugural competition in Uruguay in 1930 for economic reasons, and were banned from the 1950 World Cup as the DFB was reinstated as a FIFA member only two months after this tournament.\n\n\nGermany has also won the European Championship three times, the joint-most with Spain. France and Italy, with two titles each, are the only other multiple winners. Germany finished as runners-up three times.[171] The Germans have qualified for every European Championship tournament except for the first European Championship they entered in 1968.[171] For that tournament, Germany was in the only group of three teams and thus only played four qualifying games. The deciding game was a scoreless draw in Albania which gave Yugoslavia the edge, having won in their neighbour country. The team finished outside the top eight in only three occasions: group stage eliminations in 2000[172] and 2004[173] alongside a round of 16 exit in 2020. In the other editions Germany participated in they reached at least the semi-finals nine times, an unparalleled record in Europe.\n\n\n*See also East Germany and Saarland for the results of these separate Germany teams, and Austria for the team that was merged into the Germany national team from 1938 to 1945.*\n\n\n\n### FIFA World Cup[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Germany at the FIFA World

The national team is controlled by the Portuguese Football Federation (FPF), the governing body for football in Portugal. Portugal's home matches are played at various stadiums throughout Portugal, and its primary training ground and technical headquarters, Cidade do Futebol, is located in Oeiras. The head coach of the team is Roberto Martínez,[4] and the captain is Cristiano Ronaldo, who also holds the team records for most caps and most goals.\n\n\nPortugal's first participation in a major tournament finals was at the 1966 World Cup, which saw a team featuring Ballon d'Or winner Eusébio finish in third place. Portugal also made it to the semi-finals of the UEFA Euro 1984, losing to hosts and eventual winners France. Under the team's first golden generation in the 1990s, Portugal began consistently featuring in the European Championship and World Cup; they made the semi-finals of the 2006 World Cup, finishing in fourth place, along with placing as runners-up at Euro 2004 as hosts, and reaching the semi-finals of Euro 2000 and Euro 2012. This was in great part due to the production of several players, such as Luís Figo, Rui Costa, Ricardo Carvalho, and Cristiano Ronaldo, who is regarded as one of the greatest players of all time.[5][6]\n\n\nIn 2016, Portugal won its first-ever major trophy, Euro 2016, defeating hosts France in the final. With the win, Portugal qualified and made its only appearance in the FIFA Confederations Cup held in Russia, where they finished in third place. Portugal qualified for and hosted the brand new 2019 Nations League finals where they triumphed, defeating the Netherlands and earning their second major tournament victory in three finals.\n\n\nPortugal is colloquially referred to as the *Seleção das Quinas* (a synecdoche based on the flag of the country) and has notable rivalries with Brazil, due to shared cultural traits and heritage,[7] France, due to several important meetings between the two teams at Euro and World Cup, and Spain, known as *A Guerra Ibérica* in Portuguese or *The Iberian War* in English, with the rivalry between two countries going back to 1581.[8]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the Portugal national football team\n\n### Early World Cup attempts[edit]\n\n\nPortugal were not invited to the 1930 World Cup, which only featured a finals stage and no qualification round. The team took part in the 1934 FIFA World Cup qualification, but failed to eliminate their Spanish opponents, aggregating two defeats in the two-legged round, with a 9–0 loss in Madrid and 2–1 loss in Lisbon for an aggregate score of 11–1.[9][10]\n\n\nIn the 1938 FIFA World Cup qualification, the *Seleção* played one game against Switzerland held in neutral ground in Milan. They lost 2–1 and failed to qualify for the finals.[11] The Second World War delayed the World Cup until 1950 and subsequently, the national team rarely played.[12] A 10–0 home friendly loss against England, two years after the war, still stands as their biggest ever defeat.[13]\n\n\n\n### 1950s and early 1960s[edit]\n\n\nSimilar to 1934, Portugal were to play a two-legged round against Spain. After a 5–1 defeat in Madrid, they managed to draw the second game 2–2. With a 7–3 aggregate score, they did not qualify on the pitch, however they would later be invited to replace Turkey, which had withdrawn from participating. Portugal refused to participate.[14][15]\n\n\nIn 1954 FIFA World Cup qualification, the team would play Austria; the Austrians won the first game with a 9–1 result.[16] The best the Portuguese could do was hold the Austrians to a goalless draw in Lisbon, resulting in a 9–1 aggregate defeat.[17] Four years later, Portugal won a qualifying match for the first time, a 3–0 home victory over Italy. Nevertheless, they finished last in a group that also featured Northern Ireland; only the first-placed team, Northern Ireland, would qualify.[18]\n\n\n1960 was the year that UEFA created the European Championship. The first edition was a knock-out tournament with the last four teams participating in the finals stage that only featured one leg while the earlier stages had two legs. In the first round, the *Seleção das Quinas* won 2–0 at East Germany and then 3–2 in Porto, advancing with a 5–2 two-legged win.[19][20] Portugal faced Yugoslavia in the quarter-finals, losing 6–3 on aggregate.[21]\n\n\nPortugal faced England and Luxembourg in 1962 FIFA World Cup qualification and ended up second in the group, behind England, who would be the only team in Group 6 to qualify.[22] In the 1964 European Championship, Portugal played against Bulgaria in the qualifying rounds. The Portuguese lost in Sofia and won in Lisbon. With the round tied 4–4, a replay was needed in a neutral country.[23] In the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, Portugal lost 1–0 thanks to a late strike from Georgi Asparuhov.[23]\n\n\n\n### Third place at the 1966 World Cup[edit]\n\n\nPortugal were drawn with Czechoslovakia, Romania and Turkey for 1966 World Cup qualification.[24] They topped the group with only one draw and one defeat in six games and finally qualified for a FIFA World Cup, with a 1–0 away win against Czechoslovakia and Turkey and a 5–1 home win against the Turks being notable results.[24]\n\n\nAt the World Cup, the team started out with three wins in the group stage after they beat Hungary 3–1,[25] Bulgaria 3–0, and two-time defending champions Brazil 3–1.[26] Secondly, they beat quarter-finalists North Korea 5–3, with Eusébio getting four markers to overturn a 3–0 deficit.[27] Later, they reached the semi-finals where they were beaten by hosts England 2–1; in this game, Portugal would have played in Liverpool, but as England were the hosts, FIFA decided that the game would be played in London.[28] Portugal then defeated the Soviet Union 2–1 in the third place match for their best World Cup finish to date.[29] Eusébio was the top scorer of the World Cup with nine goals. Portugal would not qualify for another World Cup for 20 years.\n\n\n\n### 1980s[edit]\n\n\nPortugal won their Euro 1984 qualifying group that contained Finland, Poland and the Soviet Union with a win over the latter,[30][31] allowing them to qualify and be placed in Group B alongside Spain, West Germany and Romania in the finals.[32] In the first two matches, they drew 0–0 and 1–1 against West Germany and Spain, respectively.[32] A 1–0 win over Romania resulted in a second place finish in group play. Portugal were paired against hosts France in the semi-finals.[32] After a draw in regular time, Portugal initially led 2–1 in extra-time, but the hosts scored in the 114th and 119th minutes to eliminate the Portuguese 3–2 and go through to the final.[32]\n\n\nFor 1986 World Cup qualification, the *Seleção* played against Czechoslovakia, Malta, Sweden and West Germany for the two spots that would guarantee them a ticket to Mexico.[33] Needing a win in the last game against West Germany in Stuttgart, Portugal won the game to become the first team to beat West Germany at their home ground in an official match. The team exited early in the group stages after a win and two losses.[34] They started with a 1–0 win against England,[35] but later were beaten by Poland and Morocco 1–0 and 3–1 respectively.[36][37] Their staying in Mexico was marked by the Saltillo Affair, where players refused to train in order to win more prizes from the Portuguese Football Federation. Mexico marked their last World Cup appearance until 2002.\n\n\n\n### 1995–2006: The golden generation[edit]\n\n\nAt UEFA Euro 1996, Portugal finished first in Group D, and in the quarter-finals, they lost 1–0 to the Czech Republic.\n\n\n\n![](image)Portugal lost the Euro 2004 final 0–1 to Greece with a header from Angelos Charisteas (pictured).\nPortugal failed to qualify for the 1998 FIFA World Cup. In Euro 2000 qualifying, Portugal finished second in their group, one point short of first-placed Romania. However, after finishing as the top runner-up nation in qualifying, Portugal nonetheless secured a spot in the finals. They then defeated England 3–2, Romania 1–0 and Germany 3–0 to finish first in Group A, then defeated Turkey in the quarter-finals. In the semi-finals against France, Portugal were eliminated in extra time when Zinedine Zidane converted a penalty. Referee Günter Benkö awarded the spot kick for a handball after Abel Xavier blocked a shot. Xavier, Nuno Gomes and Paulo Bento were all given lengthy suspensions for subsequently shoving the referee.[38] The final eventually finished 2–1.\n\n\nDuring 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifying, Portugal won the group.[39] Several problems and poor judgement decisions occurred during the preparation and tournament itself – shopping sprees by players were widely reported in the Portuguese press.[39] Questionable managing choices and some amateurism, including the same lack of agreement on prizes.[39] Portugal entered the tournament as favourites to win Group D.[39] However, they were upset 3–2 by the United States.[39] They then rebounded with a 4–0 smashing of Poland.[39] Needing a draw to advance, they lost the last group game to hosts South Korea.[40] Portugal underachieved and ended third in its group stage, subsequently eliminated. Manager António Oliveira was fired after the World Cup.\n\n\n\n![](image)Ronaldo, pictured playing against Germany at Euro 2012, assumed the captaincy in the wake of Euro 2008.\nThe next major competition, the UEFA Euro 2004, was held in Portugal. For preparation, the Football Federation made a contract with Luiz Felipe Scolari to manage the team until the tournament ended.[41] Being a favourite to win it,[*citation needed*] the host nation lost the first game against Greece 1–2.[42] They achieved their first win against Russia 2–0 and also beat Spain 1–0.[43][44] They went on to play against England, in a 2–2 draw that went into penalties, with Portugal winning.[45] Portugal beat the Netherlands 2–1 in the semi-finals,[46] and suffered a second defeat from Greece, 1–0, in the final.[47]\n\n\nAfter the tournament ended, a lot of players belonging to the *Geração de Ouro* (Golden Generation), abandoned their international footballing careers, with only Luís Figo remaining in the team, despite a temporary retirement.[48][49] The silver lining for Portugal was the emergence of Cristiano Ronaldo, who was selected in the UEFA Euro All-Star team.[50] While Portugal were playing in the competition, Scolari agreed in a new two-year deal with the Federation.\n\n\nPortugal finished first in the qualifying round for the 2006 World Cup,[51] and topped Group D in the World Cup, with victories over Angola (1–0), Iran (2–0) and Mexico (2–1).[52][53]\nPortugal defeated the Netherlands 1–0 in the Round of 16 in Nuremberg in an acrimonious match marked by 16 yellow cards, with four players sent off.[54] Portugal drew 0–0 after extra-time with England, but won 3–1 on penalties to reach their first World Cup semi-final since 1966.[55][56] They then lost 1–0 against France,[57] and faced hosts Germany in the third place play-off match in a 3–1 defeat.[58]\n\n\n\n### 2006–2014: Post-golden generation and mixed results[edit]\n\n\nFor Euro 2008 Portugal finished second in qualification behind Poland,[59] and won their first two group games against Turkey and the Czech Republic, although a loss to co-hosts Switzerland set up a quarter-final matchup with Germany which the team lost 3–2.[60] After the tournament, Scolari left to take over at Chelsea.[61] Afterwards, Carlos Queiroz was appointed as the head coach of the Portugal national team.[62][63][64][65]\n\n\nPortugal came second in the qualifying stages for the 2010 FIFA World Cup under Queiroz, then beat Bosnia and Herzegovina in a play-off, thereby reaching every tournament in the decade.[66][67][68] A 19-match undefeated streak, in which the team conceded only three goals, ended with a loss to eventual champions Spain in the round of 16, 1–0.[69] Queiroz was later criticised for setting up his team in an overly cautious way.[70] After the World Cup, squad regulars Simão, Paulo Ferreira, Miguel and Tiago all retired from international football.[71][72][73] Queiroz was banned from coaching the national team for one month after he tried to block a doping test to the team while preparing for the World Cup, as well as directing insulting words to the testers.[74] In consequence, he received a further six-month suspension. Several media outbursts from Queiroz[75] against the heads of the Portuguese Football Federation followed, which partly prompted his dismissal. Paulo Bento was appointed as his replacement at head coach.[76]\n\n\nBento's team qualified for Euro 2012; they were drawn with Germany, Denmark, and the Netherlands in a widely speculated \"group of death\".[77][78][79][80] They lost their first game 0–1 to Germany, then beat Denmark 3–2.[81][82] The final group stage match was against the Netherlands. After Van der Vaart had given the Dutch a 1–0 lead, Ronaldo netted twice to ensure a 2–1 victory.[83][84][85] Portugal finished second in the group and qualified for the knockout phase. Portugal defeated the Czech Republic 1–0 in the quarter-finals with a header from Ronaldo.[86] The semi-final match was against Spain, who defeated Portugal 4–2 on penalties after a goalless draw.[87]\n\n\nIn 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifying, Portugal won 4–2 on aggregate in a play-off against Sweden with all four goals being scored by Ronaldo, and were drawn into Group G with the United States, Germany and Ghana. Their first match against the Germans was their worst-ever defeat in a World Cup, a 4–0 loss.[88] They went on to draw 2–2 against the United States and won 2–1 against Ghana.[89][90] However, the team were eliminated due to inferior goal difference to the Americans.[91]\n\n\n\n### 2016–present: Euro 2016 and first international glories[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\n\n**Patrício**\n**Pepe**\n**Fonte**\n**Cédric**\n**Guerreiro**\n**William**\n**Adrien**\n**Sanches**\n**João Mário**\n**Nani**\n**Ronaldo (C)**\nPortugal's starting lineup for the Euro 2016 Final\n\nPortugal began the Euro 2016 qualifiers with a 0–1 home defeat against Albania, which resulted in Bento being dismissed from his managerial post to be replaced by Fernando Santos in September 2014.[92] Under Santos, the team qualified as group winners and were drawn in Group F alongside newcomers Iceland, Austria and Hungary; the Portuguese advanced into the knockout stage as the third-best third place team following three straight draws. Portugal beat Croatia 1–0 in the Round of 16 after a goal from Ricardo Quaresma in extra time[93] and then defeated Poland 5–3 on penalties to reach the semi-finals,[94] where they defeated Wales 2–0 in regulation time with goals from Ronaldo and Nani to reach the final at the Stade de France against hosts France.[95] The early stages of the final saw Ronaldo limp off the pitch injured; in extra time, substitute Eder turned hero when he scored the match's only goal in the 109th minute, defying all odds.[96][97] Ronaldo won the Silver Boot, scoring three goals and providing three assists.[98][99]\n\n\nFollowing their Euro 2016 victory, Portugal participated in the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup. Portugal faced Mexico on 17 June in their opening match, which ended in a 2–2 draw.[100] Three days later, Portugal faced hosts Russia defeating them 1–0, with the only goal of the match being scored by Cristiano Ronaldo.[101] On 24 June, Portugal defeated New Zealand 4–0 to top their group and advance to the semi-finals of the competition.[102][103] Ronaldo was also man of the match in all three of Portugal's group stage matches.[104] Portugal lost to Chile on penalties after a goalless draw in the semi-finals,[105] but rebounded in the third place game, defeating Mexico 2–1 after extra time.[106]\n\n\n\n![](image)Portugal lining up before a match at the 2018 FIFA World Cup\nIn the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifying draw, Portugal were placed in Group B along with Switzerland, Hungary, Faroe Islands, Andorra and Latvia. Portugal would only lose one match against Switzerland 2–0. However, Portugal got their revenge on their last group stage match defeating Switzerland 2–0, to top their group and qualify for the 2018 World Cup.\n\n\nIn the 2018 World Cup, Portugal were drawn into Group B with Spain, Morocco and Iran. In their opening match on 15 June, Portugal were against Spain, which ended in a 3–3 draw, with Cristiano Ronaldo scoring a hat-trick.[107] Ronaldo scored the only goal in a 1–0 victory against Morocco, breaking Puskás' record.[108] Portugal faced Iran on 25 June, in their last group match, which ended in a 1–1 draw, leading Portugal to progress to the knockout round as group runners-up behind Spain.[109] On 30 June, Portugal were eliminated following a 2–1 defeat to Uruguay in the round of 16.[110]\n\n\n\n![](image)Gonçalo Guedes, who scored the winning goal against the Netherlands in the 2019 UEFA Nations League Final\nFollowing the World Cup, Portugal were part of the inaugural UEFA Nations League, were the *Seleção* were placed in league A and were drawn into Group 3 with Italy and Poland. On 9 March 2018, UEFA announced that Portugal had expressed interest in bidding for the Nations League finals, which was later announced that the group winners would be appointed as the host.[111] Portugal started the league defeating Italy in a home 1–0 victory, with André Silva scoring the match's only goal.[112] In their second match, Portugal defeated Poland in a 3–2 away victory.[113][114] In the two remaining matches, Portugal faced Italy and Poland in a 0–0 away draw and Poland 1–1 home, respectively, to advance to the Nations League finals, thereby automatically winning hosting rights, which were confirmed by the UEFA Executive Committee on 3 December 2018.[115] In the semi-finals on 5 June 2019, Cristiano Ronaldo made his return to the team scoring a hat-trick against Switzerland to secure the hosts a spot in the final.[116] Four days later, in the finals at the Estádio do Dragão in Porto, Portugal defeated the Netherlands 1–0, with the only being scored by Gonçalo Guedes in the 60th minute.[117][118]\n\n\nPortugal were drawn in Group B for the UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying with Lithuania, Luxembourg, Ukraine, and Serbia. Portugal won five games, drew two and lost one to qualify for the final tournament from the second place. In the process, Fernando Santos overtook Luiz Felipe Scolari's record as Portugal's coach with the most victories overall. Santos' team was drawn with France, Germany and Hungary in a widely speculated \"group of death\". Portugal advanced to the next round by defeating Hungary, drawing with France and losing to Germany. There, they faced Belgium and lost 0–1, finishing 13th overall, which is Portugal's lowest placement in Euros history.\n\n\nPortugal were placed into Group A of the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers with Azerbaijan, Luxembourg, Republic of Ireland, and Serbia. After losing to Serbia at home on the last matchday, Portugal finished second and advanced to the play-off as opposed to qualifying directly.[119] On 24 March 2022, Portugal beat Turkey 3–1 in the playoff semi-final,[120] and five days later they defeated North Macedonia 2–0 in the play-off final to secure a berth in the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.[121]\n\n\nAt the 2022 World Cup, Portugal defeated Ghana 3–2 in their first group game[122] and then beat Uruguay 2–0 [123] to qualify for the knockout stages.[124] In the last group game, Portugal lost 2–1 to South Korea, but still managed to top their group.[125] The match was marked by a controversy between national team captain Cristiano Ronaldo and national team coach Fernando Santos, with Ronaldo receiving criticism from his own coach for his reaction at being substituted.[126] He was dropped from the starting line-up for Portugal's last 16 match against Switzerland, marking the first time since Euro 2008 that he had not started a game for Portugal in a major international tournament,[127] and the first time Portugal had started a knockout game without Ronaldo in the starting line-up at an international tournament since Euro 2000.[128] The Portuguese would eventually demolish Switzerland 6–1, their highest tally in a World Cup knockout game since the 1966 World Cup, with Ronaldo's replacement Gonçalo Ramos scoring a hat-trick.[129][130] Tipped as favourites, Portugal employed the same strategy in the quarter-finals against Morocco but lost 1–0, making the Atlas Lions the first African semi-finalists at the World Cup.[131] Following a disappointing World Cup campaign, which was marked by criticism over Santos defensive tactics and style of play, including the inability to utilise Portugal's attacking talent and the fracturing of his relationship Ronaldo, he was dismissed on 15 December.[132]\n\n\nOn 9 January 2023, Roberto Martinez was announced as the head coach of Portugal, replacing Fernando Santos.[133] Portugal were drawn in Group J for UEFA Euro 2024 qualifying with Bosnia and Herzegovina, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg and Slovakia. On 11 September 2023, Portugal recorded their biggest win in international history by defeating Luxembourg 9–0.[134]\n\n\nAfter having Nike as its kit manufacturer since 1997, in 2023, the team chose to replace it by Puma SE, starting in 2025.[135][136][137]\n\n\n\n## Team image[edit]\n\n\n### Kits[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Portugal national football team kits.\n\nPortugal's traditional home kit is mainly red with a green trim, reflecting the colors of the nation's flag. Over the years, the particular shade of red has alternated between a darker burgundy and a lighter scarlet. Both green and red shorts have been used to complete the strip.\n\n\nThe team's away kits, on the other hand, have varied more considerably.

The national team is controlled by the Italian Football Federation (FIGC), the governing body for football in Italy, which is a co-founder and member of UEFA. Italy's home matches are played at various stadiums throughout Italy, and its primary training ground and technical headquarters, Centro Tecnico Federale di Coverciano, is located in Florence. Italy are the reigning European champions, having won UEFA Euro 2020.\n\n\nItaly is one of the most successful national teams in the history of football and the World Cup, having won four titles (1934, 1938, 1982, 2006), appearing in two other finals (1970, 1994), and reaching also a third (1990) and a fourth (1978) place. Italy also won two European Championships (1968, 2020), and appeared in two other finals of the tournament (2000, 2012). Italy's team also achieved a second place at the CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions in 2022, and a third place at the FIFA Confederations Cup in 2013 and at the UEFA Nations League in 2021 and 2023.\n\n\nThe team is known as *gli Azzurri* (the Blues), because Savoy blue is the common colour of the national teams representing Italy, as it is the traditional paint of the royal House of Savoy, which reigned over the Kingdom of Italy. In 1938, Italy became the first team to defend its World Cup title, and due to the outbreak of World War II, retained the title for a further 12 years. Italy had also previously won two Central European International Cups (1927–30, 1933–35). Between its first two World Cup victories, Italy won the Olympic football tournament (1936). After the majority of the team was killed in a plane crash in 1949, Italy obtained poor results in the 1950s, even failing to qualify for the 1958 World Cup. Failure to qualify for the World Cup did not happen again until the consecutive editions of 2018 and 2022. However, the team was unbeaten from October 2018 to October 2021, and holds the world record for most consecutive matches without defeat (37).\n\n\nItaly has notable rivalries with other footballing nations, such as Brazil, France, Germany and Spain. In the FIFA World Rankings, in force since August 1993, Italy has occupied the first place several times, in November 1993 and during 2007 (February, April–June, September), with its worst placement in August 2018 in 21st place.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the Italy national football team\n\n### Origins and first two World Cups in 1934 and 1938[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The squad celebrating its first FIFA World Cup in 1934\nAn early attempt to create an Italian national team occurred on 30 April 1899, when an Italian selection played a Swiss eleven, losing 0–2 in Torino.[4] The team's first official match was held in Milan on 15 May 1910. Italy defeated France by a score of 6–2, with Italy's first goal scored by Pietro Lana.[5][6][7] The Italian team played with a (2–3–5) system and consisted of: De Simoni; Varisco, Calì; Trerè, Fossati, Capello; Debernardi, Rizzi, Cevenini I, Lana, Boiocchi. The first captain of the team was Francesco Calì.[8]\n\n\nThe first success in an official tournament came with the bronze medal in 1928 Summer Olympics, held in Amsterdam. After losing the semi-final against Uruguay, an 11–3 victory against Egypt secured third place in the competition. In the 1927–30 and 1933–35 Central European International Cup, Italy achieved the first place out of five Central European teams, topping the group with 11 points in both editions of the tournament.[9][10] Italy would also later win the gold medal at the 1936 Summer Olympics with a 2–1 victory in extra time in the gold medal match over Austria on 15 August 1936.[11]\n\n\nAfter declining to participate in the inaugural World Cup (1930, in Uruguay) the Italy national team won two consecutive editions of the tournament in 1934 and 1938, under the direction of coach Vittorio Pozzo and the performance of Giuseppe Meazza, who is considered one of the best Italian football players of all time by some.[12][13] Italy hosted the 1934 World Cup, and played their first ever World Cup match in a 7–1 win over the United States in Rome. Italy defeated Czechoslovakia 2–1 in extra time in the final in Rome, with goals by Raimundo Orsi and Angelo Schiavio to achieve their first World cup title in 1934. They achieved their second title in 1938 in a 4–2 defeat of Hungary, with two goals by Gino Colaussi and two goals by Silvio Piola in the World Cup that followed. Rumour has it, before the 1938 finals fascist Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini was to have sent a telegram to the team, saying \"Vincere o morire!\" (literally translated as \"Win or die!\"). However, no record remains of such a telegram, and World Cup player Pietro Rava said when interviewed: \"No, no, no, that's not true. He sent a telegram wishing us well, but no never 'win or die.'\"[14]\n\n\n\n### 1946–1966: post-World War II[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Italy national team in 1965\nIn 1949, 10 of the 11 players in the team's initial line-up were killed in a plane crash that affected Torino, winners of the previous five Serie A titles. Italy did not advance further than the first round of the 1950 World Cup, as they were weakened severely due to the air disaster. The team had travelled by boat rather than by plane, fearing another accident.[15]\n\n\nIn the World Cup finals of 1954 and 1962, Italy failed to progress past the first round, and did not qualify for the 1958 World Cup due to a 2–1 defeat to Northern Ireland in the last match of the qualifying round. Italy did not take part in the first edition of the European Championship in 1960 (then known as the European Nations Cup), and was knocked out by the Soviet Union in the first round of the 1964 European Nations' Cup qualifying.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nTheir participation in the 1966 World Cup was ended by a 0–1 defeat at the hands of North Korea. Despite being the tournament favourites, the *Azzurri*, whose 1966 squad included Gianni Rivera and Giacomo Bulgarelli, were eliminated in the first round by the semi-professional North Koreans. The Italian team was bitterly condemned upon their return home, while North Korean scorer Pak Doo-ik was celebrated as the David who killed Goliath. Upon Italy's return home, furious fans threw fruit and rotten tomatoes at their transport bus at the airport.[16][17]\n\n\n\n### 1968–1974: European champions and World Cup runners-up[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Captain Giacinto Facchetti celebrates Italy's UEFA Euro 1968 victory\nIn 1968, Italy participated in their first European Championship, hosting the European Championship and winning their first major competition since the 1938 World Cup, beating Yugoslavia in Rome for the title. The match is the only European Championship or World Cup final to go to a replay.[18] After extra time the final ended in a 1–1 draw, and in the days before penalty shootouts, the rules required the match to be replayed a few days later. Italy won the replay 2–0 (with goals from Gigi Riva and Pietro Anastasi) to take the trophy. The semi-final was won on a coin toss.\n\n\nIn the 1970 World Cup, exploiting the performances of European champions' players like Giacinto Facchetti, Gianni Rivera and Gigi Riva and with a new centre-forward Roberto Boninsegna, the team were able to come back to a World Cup final match after 32 years. They reached this result after one of the most famous matches in football history—the \"Game of the Century\", the 1970 World Cup semifinal between Italy and West Germany that Italy won 4–3 in extra time, with five of the seven goals coming in extra time.[19] They were later defeated by Brazil in the final 4–1.\n\n\nThe cycle of international successes ended at the 1974 World Cup, where the team was eliminated in the group stage after a 2–1 loss against Poland in the last match of the group.\n\n\n\n### 1978–1986: Third World Cup generation[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1978 FIFA World Cup in Argentina, a new generation of Italian players, the most famous being Paolo Rossi, came to the international stage. Italy was the only team in the tournament to beat the eventual champions and host team Argentina. Second-round games against West Germany (0–0), Austria (1–0) and Netherlands (1–2) led Italy to the third-place final, where the team was defeated by Brazil 2–1. In the match that eliminated Italy from the tournament against the Netherlands, Italian goalkeeper Dino Zoff was beaten by a long-distance shot from Arie Haan, and Zoff was criticized for the defeat.[20] Italy hosted the 1980 UEFA European Football Championship, the first edition to be held between eight teams instead of four,[21] automatically qualifying for the finals as hosts. After two draws with Spain and Belgium and a narrow 1–0 win over England, Italy were beaten by Czechoslovakia in the third-place match on penalties 9–8 after Fulvio Collovati missed his kick.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Italy's starting line-up, before the match against Argentina in a group stage game at the 1982 FIFA World Cup\n![](image)One of the widely remembered pictures of the 1982 FIFA World Cup, Italian President Sandro Pertini playing scopone with Dino Zoff, Franco Causio and coach Bearzot.\nAfter a scandal in Serie A where some National team players such as Paolo Rossi[22] were prosecuted and suspended for match fixing and illegal betting, the *Azzurri* qualified for the second round of the 1982 World Cup after three uninspiring draws against Poland, Peru and Cameroon. Having been loudly criticized, the Italian team decided on a press black-out from then on, with only coach Enzo Bearzot and captain Dino Zoff appointed to speak to the press. Italy's regrouped in the second round group, a group of death with Argentina and Brazil. In the opener, Italy prevailed 2–1 over Argentina, with Italy's goals, both left-footed strikes, were scored by Marco Tardelli and Antonio Cabrini. After Brazil defeated Argentina 3–1, Italy needed to win in order to advance to the semi-finals. Twice Italy went in the lead with Paolo Rossi's goals, and twice Brazil came back. When Falcão scored to make it 2–2, Brazil would have been through on goal difference, but in the 74th minute Rossi scored the winning goal, for a hat-trick, in a crowded penalty area to send Italy to the semifinals after one of the greatest games in World Cup history.[23][24][25]\n\n\nItaly then progressed to the semi-final where they defeated Poland with two goals from Rossi. In the final, Italy met West Germany, who had advanced by a penalty shootout victory against France. The first half ended scoreless, after Antonio Cabrini missed a penalty awarded for a Hans-Peter Briegel foul on Bruno Conti. In the second half Paolo Rossi again scored the first goal, and while the Germans were pushing forward in search of an equaliser, Marco Tardelli and substitute Alessandro Altobelli finalised two *contropiede* counterattacks to make it 3–0. Paul Breitner scored home West Germany's consolation goal seven minutes from the end.[26]\n\n\nTardelli's cry \"Gol! Gol!\" was one of the defining images of Italy's 1982 World Cup triumph.[27] Paolo Rossi won the Golden Boot with six goals as well as the Golden Ball Award for the best player of the tournament,[28] and 40-year-old captain-goalkeeper Dino Zoff became the oldest player to win the World Cup.[29] However, Italy failed to qualify for the 1984 European Championship.[30][31] Italy then entered as reigning champions in the 1986 World Cup[32][33][34] but were eliminated by reigning European Champions, France, in the round of 16.[35]\n\n\n\n### 1986–1994: World Cup runners-up[edit]\n\n\nIn 1986, Azeglio Vicini was appointed as new head coach, replacing Bearzot.[36] New coach conceded a chance to young players, such as Ciro Ferrara and Gianluca Vialli:[37] Sampdoria striker scored goals that gave Italy 1988 European Championship pass.[38] He was also shown like Altobelli's possibly successor, having his same goal attitude.[39] Both forwards stroke the target in Germany, where Soviet Union defeated the *Azzurri* in semi-finals.[40]\n\n\n\n![](image)Roberto Baggio in 1990\nItaly hosted the World Cup for the second time in 1990. The Italian attack featured talented forwards Salvatore Schillaci and a young Roberto Baggio. Italy played nearly all of their matches in Rome and did not concede a single goal in their first five matches; however, they lost the semi-final in Naples to defending champion Argentina. Argentinian player Maradona, who played for Napoli, made comments prior to the game pertaining to the North–South inequality in Italy and the *risorgimento*, asking Neapolitans to root for Argentina in the game.[41] Italy lost 4–3 on penalty kicks following a 1–1 draw after extra time. Schillaci's first-half opener was equalised in the second half by Claudio Caniggia's header for Argentina. Aldo Serena missed the final penalty kick with Roberto Donadoni also having his penalty saved by goalkeeper Sergio Goycochea. Italy went on to defeat England 2–1 in the third-place match in Bari, with Schillaci scoring the winning goal on a penalty to become the tournament's top scorer with six goals. Italy then failed to qualify for the 1992 European Championship. In November 1993, FIFA ranked Italy first in the FIFA World Rankings for their first time since the ranking system was introduced in December 1992.[42]\n\n\nAt the 1994 World Cup in the United States, Italy lost the opening match against Ireland 0–1 at the Giants Stadium near New York City. After a 1–0 win against Norway in New York City and a 1–1 draw with Mexico at the RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C., Italy advanced from Group E based on goals scored among the four teams tied on points. During their round of 16 match at the Foxboro Stadium near Boston, Italy was down 0–1 late against Nigeria, but Baggio rescued Italy with an equaliser in the 88th minute and a penalty in extra time to take the win.[43] Baggio scored another late goal against Spain at their quarter-final match in Boston to seal a 2–1 win and two goals against Bulgaria in their semi-final match in New York City for another 2–1 win.[44][45]\n\n\nIn the final, which took place in Los Angeles's Rose Bowl stadium 2,700 miles (4,320 km) and three time zones away from the Atlantic Northeast part of the United States where they had played all their previous matches, Italy, who had 24 hours less rest than Brazil, played 120 minutes of scoreless football, taking the match to a penalty shootout, the first time a World Cup final was settled in a penalty shootout.[46] Italy lost the subsequent shootout 3–2 after Baggio, who had been playing with the aid of a pain-killer injection[47] and a heavily bandaged hamstring,[48][49] missed the final penalty kick of the match, shooting over the crossbar.[50][51]\n\n\n\n### 1996–2000: European Championship runners-up[edit]\n\n\nAfter qualifying for Euro 1996 on level points with Croatia, Italy did not progress beyond the group stage at the final tournament. Having defeated Russia 2–1 but losing to the Czech Republic by the same score, Italy required a victory in their final group match to progress to the quarter-finals. Gianfranco Zola failed to convert a decisive penalty in a 0–0 draw against Germany, who eventually won the tournament.[52]\n\n\nRelegated to second place behind England in the qualification campaign for the 1998 World Cup, Italy booked a place at the final tournament after defeating Russia in a play-off, with Pierluigi Casiraghi scoring the winning goal in a 2–1 aggregate victory on 15 November 1997.[53] After finishing first in their group and overcoming Norway in the second round, Italy faced a penalty shootout in the quarterfinals, for the third World Cup in a row.[54] The Italian side, where Alessandro Del Piero and Baggio renewed the controversial *staffetta* (\"relay\") between Mazzola and Rivera from 1970, held the eventual World Champions and host team, France, to a 0–0 draw after extra time, but lost 4–3 in the shootout. With two goals scored in this tournament, Baggio remains the only Italian player to have scored in three different FIFA World Cup editions.[55]\n\n\n\n![](image)Italy (right) lineup ahead of the UEFA Euro 2000 Final against France Two years later, Italy faced another penalty shootout Euro 2000 but emerged victorious over the co-hosts, the Netherlands in the semifinal.[56] Italian goalkeeper Francesco Toldo saving one penalty during the match and two in the shootout, while the Dutch players missed one other penalty during the match and one during the shootout with a rate of one penalty scored out of six attempts. Striker Francesco Totti scored his penalty with a *cucchiaio* (\"spoon\") chip.[57] Italy finished the tournament as runners-up, losing the final 2–1 against France (to a golden goal in extra time) after conceding an equalising goal just 30 seconds before the expected end of injury time.[58] After the defeat, coach Dino Zoff resigned in protest after being criticized by AC Milan club president and politician Silvio Berlusconi.[59]\n\n\n### 2000–2010: early 21st century[edit]\n\n\nGiovanni Trapattoni took charge of the team in July 2000 following the resignation of Dino Zoff.[60] Playing in Group 8 of the 2002 FIFA World Cup qualification process, Italy finished undefeated after facing Romania, Georgia, Hungary and Lithuania. In the final tournament, a 2–0 victory against Ecuador with a double from Christian Vieri was followed by a series of controversial matches. During the match against Croatia, English referee Graham Poll disallowed two goals resulting in a 2–1 defeat for Italy.[61] Despite two goals being ruled for offsides, a late headed goal from Alessandro Del Piero helped Italy to a 1–1 draw with Mexico, proving enough to advance to the knockout stages.[62]\n\n\nCo-host country South Korea eliminated Italy in the round of 16 by a score of 2–1. The match proved controversial with members of the Italian team, most notably striker Francesco Totti and coach Giovanni Trapattoni, suggesting a conspiracy to eliminate Italy from the competition.[63] Trapattoni even obliquely accused FIFA of ordering the official to ensure a Korean victory so that one of the two host nations would remain in the tournament.[64] The most contentious decisions by the game referee Byron Moreno were an early penalty awarded to South Korea (saved by Buffon), a golden goal by Damiano Tommasi ruled offside, and the sending off of Totti after being presented with a second yellow card for an alleged dive in the penalty area.[65] FIFA President Sepp Blatter stated that the linesmen had been a \"disaster\" and admitted that Italy suffered from bad offside calls during the group matches, but he denied conspiracy allegations. While questioning Totti's sending off by Moreno, Blatter refused to blame Italy's loss entirely on the referees, stating: \"Italy's elimination is not only down to referees and linesmen who made human not premeditated errors. Italy made mistakes both in defense and in attack.\"[66]\n\n\nTrapattoni stayed on to coach Italy for UEFA Euro 2004 in Portugal. He guided the team to a first-place finish in Group 9 overcoming Wales, Serbia and Montenegro, Finland and Azerbaijan. With draws against Denmark and Sweden along with a victory over Bulgaria in Group C, Italy were eliminated following a three-way five point tie based on the number of goals scored in matches among the tied teams.[67] Goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon and then Italian football federation president Franco Carraro accused the Swedish and Danish teams of fixing the result.[68] Despite calls, then-UEFA spokesperson Robert Faulkner said the organization would not investigate the result.[69]\n\n\nAfter initially refusing to resign following Italy's elimination from the tournament, the Italian Football Federation replaced Trapattoni with Marcello Lippi.[70][71]\n\n\n\n#### Fourth World Cup title[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Within the crowd in the Circus Maximus in Rome, after the Italian team scored against France\n![](image)Italian President Giorgio Napolitano congratulates coach Lippi and captain Cannavaro after the final match against France\nWith controversy plaguing the domestic league, Italy entered the final tournament as one of the eight seeded teams.[72][73][74][75] Italy finished first in Group E with wins against Ghana and the Czech Republic and a draw with the United States.[76][77]\n\n\nIn the round of 16, Italy secured a 1–0 victory over Australia with Francesco Totti scoring a penalty.[78] Italy overcame Ukraine, 3–0, after taking an early lead through Gianluca Zambrotta and additional goals coming from Luca Toni.[79] In the semi-finals, Italy beat hosts Germany 2–0 with goals Fabio Grosso and Alessandro Del Piero in the last minutes of extra time.[80]\n\n\nThe *Azzurri* won their fourth World Cup title after defeating France in the final. French captain Zinedine Zidane opened the scoring from the penalty spot in the seventh minute before Materazzi scored from a corner kick, twelve minutes later. The score remained level and though extra-time and Zidane was sent off for headbutting Materazzi.[81] Italy went on to win the penalty shootout 5–3, with all Italian players scoring their kicks.[82]\n\n\nFIFA named seven Italian players — Gianluigi Buffon, Fabio Cannavaro, Gianluca Zambrotta, Andrea Pirlo, Gennaro Gattuso, Francesco Totti and Luca Toni — to the 23-man tournament All Star Team.[83] Buffon also won the Lev Yashin Award, given to the best goalkeeper of the tournament; he conceded only two goals in the tournament's seven matches, the first an own goal by Zaccardo and the second from Zidane's penalty kick in the final, and remained unbeaten for 460 consecutive minutes.[84]\nIn honour of Italy winning a fourth FIFA World Cup, members of the squad were awarded the Italian Order of Merit of *Cavaliere*.[85][86]\n\n\n\n#### 2006–2010: post-World Cup decline[edit]\n\n\nMarcello Lippi, who had announced his resignation three days after the World Cup triumph, was replaced by Roberto Donadoni.[87] Italy qualified from their Euro 2008 qualifying group ahead of France. On 14 February 2007, Italy climbed to first in the FIFA World Rankings for only the second time.[42]\n\n\nAt Euro 2008, the *Azzurri* lost 3–0 to the Netherlands in the opening match of the group stage. The following game against Romania ended 1–1 thanks to a penalty save from Gianluigi Buffon.[88] Italy would win their final group game against France 2–0, a rematch of the 2006 World Cup final. The Azzurri were eliminated in the quarter-finals on penalties to eventual champions Spain. Within a week of the game, Roberto Donadoni's contract was terminated and Marcello Lippi was rehired as coach.[89]\n\n\nItaly qualified for their first ever FIFA Confederations Cup held in South Africa in June 2009 by virtue of winning the 2006 World Cup. They won their opening match of the tournament against the United States, but subsequent defeats to Egypt and Brazil meant that they finished third in the group on goals scored, and were eliminated.[90]\n\n\nAt the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, reigning champions Italy were unexpectedly eliminated in the first round, finishing last place in their group. After being held to 1–1 draws with Paraguay and New Zealand, they suffered a 3–2 loss to Slovakia.[91] It was the first time Italy failed to win a single game at a World Cup finals tournament, and in doing so became only the third nation to be eliminated in the first round while being reigning World Cup champions.[92]\n\n\n\n### 2010–2016: Cesare Prandelli and Antonio Conte[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The national football team of Italy before the UEFA Euro 2012 final, Olympic Stadium, Kyiv, 1 July 2012\nMarcello Lippi stepped down after Italy's World Cup campaign and was replaced by Cesare Prandelli, although Lippi's successor had already been announced before the tournament.[93]\n\n\nAt UEFA Euro 2012, Italy finished second in their group behind Spain, which earned them a quarter-final tie against England. After a mostly one-sided affair in which Italy failed to take their chances, they managed to beat England on penalties.[94][95] In the semi-final against Germany, two first-half goals by Mario Balotelli saw the Italians through to the final. In the final, Italy fell to a 4–0 defeat to Spain.[96]\n\n\nDuring the 2013 Confederations Cup in Brazil, Italy reached the semi-finals, losing 7–6 on penalties to Spain.[97] Italy did manage to beat Uruguay in the third place play-off. At the 2014 FIFA World Cup, Italy managed to defeat England 2–1 in their first match before succumbing to underdogs Costa Rica 1–0 in the second group stage match.[98][99] In Italy's last group match, they were knocked out by Uruguay 1–0, in a controversial match.[100][101] Shortly after this loss, coach Cesare Prandelli resigned.[102]\n\n\nFormer Juventus manager Antonio Conte was selected to replace Cesare Prandelli as coach after the 2014 World Cup. On 10 October 2015, Italy qualified for Euro 2016, courtesy of a 3–1 win over Azerbaijan;[103] the result meant that Italy had gone 50 games unbeaten in European qualifiers.[104]\n\n\nOn 4 April 2016, it was announced that Antonio Conte would step down as Italy coach after Euro 2016 to become head coach of Chelsea.[105] The 23-man squad was initially criticised by many fans and members of the media for its lack of quality,[106] which saw notable absences such as Andrea Pirlo and Sebastian Giovinco being controversially left out.[107] Italy opened Euro 2016 with a 2–0 victory over Belgium and qualified thanks to a win against Sweden in the second match.[108][109] Italy subsequently defeated reigning European champions Spain 2–0 in the round of 16.[110] However, Italy were defeated by reigning World champions Germany, in the quarter-finals on penalties.[111][112]\n\n\n\n### Failure to qualify for the 2018 World Cup[edit]\n\n\nAfter Conte's planned departure following Euro 2016, Gian Piero Ventura took over as manager for the team.[113] During qualification for the 2018 World Cup, Italy finished second in Group G, five points behind Spain.[114][115] Italy would have to compete in the play-off round against Sweden. However, Italy would lose 1–0 on aggregate to Sweden and were therefore eliminated; the first time that Italy had failed to qualify for the World Cup since 1958.[116] Following the match, veterans Andrea Barzagli, Daniele De Rossi and captain Gianluigi Buffon all declared their retirement from the national team.[117] On 15 November 2017, Ventura was dismissed as head coach,[118] and on 20 November 2017, Carlo Tavecchio resigned as president of the Italian Football Federation.[119]\n\n\n\n### 2018–2023: Mancini era[edit]\n\n\n#### Resurgence and second European title[edit]\n\n\nOn 14 May 2018, Roberto Mancini was announced as the new manager.[120] On 16 August 2018, in the FIFA World Ranking that followed the 2018 World Cup, Italy dropped to their lowest ever ranking of 21st.[121]\n\n\nOn 18 November, Italy finished Group J with ten wins in all ten matches, qualifying for the final tournament and becoming only the sixth national side to qualify for a European Championship with a perfect record.[122] On 17 March 2020, UEFA confirmed that Euro 2020 would be postponed by one year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[123]\n\n\n\n![](image)President of Italy Sergio Mattarella (*right*) congratulates captain Chiellini in Rome, the day after Italy's triumph at UEFA Euro 2020\nAt the delayed Euro 2020, Italy finished top of Group A, ahead of Turkey, Switzerland, and Wales. Being one of the host nations, Italy played all three group games at home at Rome's Stadio Olimpico. Italy became the first team in European Championship history to win each group stage match without conceding.[124] In the round of 16, Italy defeated Austria at Wembley Stadium after extra time.[125] In the quarter-finals, Italy overcame Belgium before beating Spain on penalties in the semi-finals.[126][127]\n\n\nOn 11 July 2021, Italy won the European Championships on penalties, their first European Championship title since 1968. Italy defeated hosts England at Wembley Stadium on penalties after a 1–1 draw.[128] On 16 July, all members of the European Championship-winning squad were awarded the Italian Order of Merit of *Cavaliere*.[129]\n\n\n\n#### Failure to qualify for 2022 World Cup and resignal[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2021, Italy participated in the UEFA Nations League Finals as hosts. However, Italy lost the semi-final against Spain, 2–1 at the San Siro.[130] This match meant the end of the record 37 game unbeaten run and the first defeat for Italy in more than 3 years. Four days later, Italy won the third-place play-off, 2–1 against Belgium.[131] On 15 November 2021, Italy drew 0–0 with Northern Ireland in their final 2022 World Cup qualifying Group C match and finished in second place, two points behind Switzerland.[132] On 24 March 2022, Italy lost 1–0 in the semi-final of the play-offs against North Macedonia, therefore, failing to qualify for the World Cup for a second consecutive time.[133][134]\n\n\nOn 1 June 2022, Italy took part in the CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions match, rebranded as the 2022 Finalissima, losing 3–0 against Argentina.[135] On 26 September, Italy qualified to the 2023 UEFA Nations League Finals after beating Hungary 2–0 in Budapest.[136] On 15 June 2023, Italy played the semi-final against Spain, losing 2–1.[137] Three days later, Italy won the third-place final 3–2 against the Netherlands.[138] Mancini's stay on Italy's bench ended a few months later following his resignation, with Luciano Spalletti being chosen in his place.[139][140]\n\n\n\n## Rivalries[edit]\n\n\n* **Italy vs. Brazil**: Matches between the nations are known as the World Derby (Portuguese: *Clássico Mundial* in Portuguese).[141] The most successful football nations in the world, they have achieved nine World Cups between one another. Since their first match at the 1938 World Cup, they have played against each other a total of five times in the World Cup, most notably in the 1970 World Cup Final and the 1994 World Cup final in which Brazil won 4–1 and 3–2 on penalties after a goalless draw respectively.[142]\n\n\n* **Italy vs. France**: Matches between the two nations officially began on 15 May 1910, Italy's first recorded match ending in a 6–2 victory.[143][144] Notable matches in the World Cup and the European Football Championship include the 2006 World Cup Final, when the Italians defeated the French 5–3 in the penalty shoot-out, after a 1–1 draw, and the 2000 European Championship, won by France with an extra-time golden goal by David Trezeguet.[145]\n\n\n* **Italy vs. Germany**: Matches between the two nations have cumulated in five matches in the World Cup, notably in the \"Game of the Century\", the 1970 World Cup semifinal between the two countries that Italy won 4–3 in extra time, with five of the seven goals coming in extra time.[146] Germany has also won three European Championships while Italy has won it twice. The two countries have faced each other four times in the European championship, with three draws (one German penalty shoot-out victory) and one Italian victory.[147] Germany had never defeated Italy in a major tournament match until their victory in the Euro 2016 quarterfinals, on penalties (though statistically considered a draw), with all Germany's other wins over Italy being in friendly competitions.[112]\n\n\n* **Italy vs. Spain**: This surely is a less heated and less heart-felt rivalry for the italians, especially when compared to those with Germany and France. Matches between the nations are known as the Mediterranean Derby (Spanish: *Rivalidad futbolística Italia-España)*, named after the Mediterranean Sea that separates the two nations.[148] Two nations have been contested since 1920, and, although the two nations are not immediate geographical neighbours, their rivalry at international level is enhanced by the strong performances of the representative clubs in UEFA competitions, in which they are among the leading associations and have each enjoyed spells of dominance.[149][150] Since the quarterfinal match between the two countries at Euro 2008, the rivalry has renewed, with its most notable match between the two sides being in the UEFA Euro 2012 Final, which Spain won 4–0.[151][152]\n\n\n## Team image[edit]\n\n\n### Kits and crest[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Italy national football team kits.\n\n![](image)Italy in 1910, wearing the original white jersey. They would switch to the traditional blue shirt a year later.\n![Giuseppe Meazza in the early 1930s wearing Italy's blue shirt with the cross of the House of Savoy badge.](image)\nThe blue shirt had a House of Savoy badge during the early 1930s.\n![Giacinto Facchetti wearing the classic Italian uniform in 1968: blue shirt, white shorts and blue socks and the tricolour badge.](image)\nItaly's classic kit, worn by Giacinto Facchetti in 1968.\n\nThe first shirt worn by the Italy national team, in its debut against France on 15 May 1910, was white. The choice of colour was due to the fact that a decision about the appearance of the kit had not yet been made, so it was decided not to have a colour, which was why white was chosen.[153] After two games, for a friendly against Hungary in Milan on 6 January 1911, the white shirt was replaced by a blue jersey (specifically savoy azure) — blue being the border colour of the royal House of Savoy crest used on the flag of the Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946); the shirt was accompanied by white shorts and black socks (which later became blue).[153] The team later became known as *gli Azzurri* (the Blues).[153][154][155][156]\n\n\nIn the 1930s, Italy wore a black kit, ordered by the fascist regime of Benito Mussolini. The black kit debuted on 17 February 1935 in a friendly against France at the Stadio Nazionale PNF in Rome.[157] A blue shirt, white shorts and black socks were worn at the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin the following year. At the 1938 FIFA World Cup in France, the all-black kit was worn once in the match against France.[158]\n\n\nAfter World War II, the fascist regime fell and the monarchy was abolished in 1946. The same year saw the birth of the Italian Republic, and the blue-and-white kit was reinstated. The cross of the former Royal House of Savoy was removed from the flag of Italy, and consequently from the national team's badge, now consisting solely of the *Tricolore*. For the 1954 FIFA World Cup, the country's name in Italian, *ITALIA*, was placed above the tricolour shield, and for the 1982 FIFA World Cup, *FIGC*, the abbreviation of the Italian Football Federation, was incorporated into the badge.[153]\n\n\nIn 1983, to celebrate the victory at the World Cup of the previous year, three gold stars replaced *ITALIA* above the tricolour, representing their three World Cup victories until that point. In 1984, a round emblem was launched, featuring the three stars, the inscriptions *ITALIA* and *FIGC*, and the tricolour.[153]\n\n\nThe first known kit manufacturer was Adidas in 1974. From 2003 to 2022, the kit was made by Puma.[153] Since the 2000s, an all-blue uniform including blue shorts has occasionally been used, particularity in international tournaments.[153] After Italy's 2006 World Cup victory, a fourth star was added to the tricolour badge. In March 2022, after almost 20 years with Puma, it was announced that Adidas will be Italy's kit manufacturer from 2023.[159]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Kit supplier\n | Period\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| *No supplier* | 1910–1974\n |\n| ![West Germany](image) Adidas | 1974–1979\n |\n| ![France](image) Le Coq Sportif | 1980–1986\n |\n| ![Italy](image) Diadora | 1986–1995\n |\n| ![United States](image) Nike | 1996–1999\n |\n| ![Italy](image) Kappa | 2000–2002\n |\n| ![Germany](image) Puma | 2003–2022\n |\n| ![Germany](image) Adidas\n | 2023–present\n |\n\n\n## Coaching staff[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Italy national football team managers\n\n![](image)Luciano Spalletti, the current head coach of Italy national football team.\nDuring the earliest days of Italian nation football, it was common for a Technical Commission to be appointed. The Commission took the role that a standard coach would currently play. Ever since 1967, the national team has been controlled only by the coach. For this reason, the coach of the Italy national team is still called *Technical Commissioner* (*Italian: *Commissario tecnico**) or *CT.* The use of this title has since then expanded into other team

Starting in 2023, Greece play their home matches in Nea Filadelfeia, a suburb of Athens, at the newly built Agia Sophia Stadium. Greece is one of only ten national teams to have been crowned UEFA European Champions.\n\n\nGreece had a small presence in international football. From the 1980s they have experienced the first taste, but not a banquet, of football achievement. Their first appearance in a major tournament was at UEFA Euro 1980 where they were knocked out in the group stage. Their qualification to the then eight-team UEFA European Championship gave them a position in the top eight European football nations that year. Greece did not qualify for another major tournament until the 1994 FIFA World Cup and after an undefeated qualifying campaign, they produced a poor performance in the finals, losing all three group matches without scoring.\n\n\nUEFA Euro 2004 marked the highest point in Greece's football history when they won the tournament in only their second participation. Dismissed as rank outsiders before the tournament, Greece defeated some of the favourites in the competition including defending European champions France and hosts Portugal. During the tournament, Greece defeated the hosts in both the opening game of the tournaments and again in the final. Their triumph earned them a place in the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup.\n\n\nIn the decade after the 2004 victory, Greece qualified for the finals tournaments of all but one major competition entered, reaching the quarter-finals at the UEFA Euro 2012 and the round of 16 at the 2014 FIFA World Cup. During that period, they occupied a place in the top 20 of the FIFA World Rankings for all but four months, and reached an all-time high of eighth in the world from April to June 2008, as well as in October 2011.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Football in Greece\n\n![](image)The national team for the Inter-Allied Games in Paris, 1919.\n![](image)Greece squad for the 1920 Olympics.\n### First years[edit]\n\n\nOn 12 April 1896, a Greek XI represented by Podilatikos Syllogos Athinon lost to a Denmark XI by either 9–0 or 15–0, at the Neo Phaliron Velodrome in Athens in a demonstration game during the 1896 Olympic Games.[4]\n\n\nThe first three editions of the Olympic football event (1900–06) had an unofficial status, as the event was not yet open for national football teams to compete, and only had limited participation of three or four club teams from a few nations. Greece had no club team invited in the 1900 Olympics and the 1904 Olympics, but then hosted the 1906 Olympics, competing against a Danish club team again (DBU Copenhagen) and two club teams from the Ottoman Empire (Smyrna and Thessaloniki). The team to represent Greece compiled of players from Athens, hence the **Athens City** selection, and in the final they conceded 9 goals from the Denmark XI in the first half alone, and thereby they withdrew from the final at half time, and were then invited to a play-off in a match to decide the second place, but Athens declined and were promptly ejected from the tournament.[5]\n\n\nGreece had to wait 13 years for their next (unofficial) appearance when they participated in the Inter-Allied Games in Paris in 1919, following the end of World War I, and once again it was a disaster as the team conceded twenty goals without reply in their first two games, although this time with a silver lining since Greece managed to beat Romania in their third and final match with a dramatic 3–2 win.[6] In the following year, Greece participated in the 1920 Summer Games of Antwerp, being knocked out in the first round by Sweden with yet another heavy defeat (9–0). This match is recognized as their first official match by FIFA.[7] Notable figures during these years was Giorgos Kalafatis, player and later manager of the team, and Giannis Andrianopoulos.\n\n\nThe Greece national team's first official match came on 7 April 1929 in a 1–4 loss to Italy B, with Alvertos Nahmias being the author of the nation's first-ever official goal.[8]\n\n\n\n### 1930s Balkan Cups[edit]\n\n\nBetween 1929 and 1936, Greece participated in six Balkan Cups, with their best campaign coming in the 1934–35 Balkan Cup when they finished second just one point short of Yugoslavia. A notable figure during these years was Kostas Choumis, who scored a total of 7 goals in the Balkan Cup, being among the all-time top goal scorers in the competition's history.[9]\n\n\n\n### 1950s Mediterranean Cups[edit]\n\n\nBetween 1949 and 1958, Greece participated in three Mediterranean Cups, with their best campaign coming in the 1950–53 Mediterranean Cup when they finished second just one point short of Italy B. A notable figure during these years was Georgios Darivas, who was the top goal scorer of the 1950-53 edition with 4 goals, a tally that includes a hat-trick against Turkey.[10]\n\n\nIn 1951, Greece also won the 1st edition of the Mediterranean Games men's football tournament, held in Alexandria, Egypt, defeating both Syria and the hosts Egypt on their way to the title.[11] The star of the Greece team was Nikos Lekatsas, who was the top goal scorer with 4 goals, a tally that includes a hat-trick against Syria.\n\n\n\n### 1970s World Cups near misses[edit]\n\n\nDuring the following decades, Greece had passion but little international success in the sport, as the nation's economical and social situations after World War II did not allow for successful development of a national team.\n\n\nAt its best, Greece narrowly missed qualifying for two FIFA World Cup competitions: 1970 (despite a quality team, including some of its greatest-ever players, such as Mimis Domazos, Giorgos Sideris, Giorgos Koudas and Mimis Papaioannou), and 1978.\n\n\n\n### Euro 1980[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Alketas Panagoulias led Greece to the Euro 1980 and 1994 FIFA World Cup.\nGreece, under the guidance of Alketas Panagoulias, made its first appearance in a major tournament at the Euro 1980 in Italy, after qualifying top of a group that included the Soviet Union and Hungary, both world football powers.[12] In the final tournament, Greece was drawn into group A with West Germany, the Netherlands, and Czechoslovakia. In their first game, Greece held the Dutch until the only goal of the game was scored with a penalty kick by Kist, in the 65th minute. Three days later Greece played Czechoslovakia in Rome. After holding the Czechoslovakians 1–1 at the end the first half, Greece eventually lost 3–1. In their last game, Greece earned a 0–0 draw against eventual winners West Germany, concluding what was considered a decent overall performance in the team's maiden presence in a final phase of any football competition.\n\n\n\n### Wilderness before 1994[edit]\n\n\nGreece failed to qualify for six competitive tournaments: three World Cups and three Euros, during which the Greeks largely produced poor performance. Despite this, Greece did have some surprisingly good results, such as a shock away draw to Italy in the 1982 FIFA World Cup qualification; a 3–2 win away over Hungary and a goalless draw away to England for the UEFA Euro 1984 qualifying; a goalless home draw to Belgium in the 1986 FIFA World Cup qualification; a surprise 1–0 home victory over Poland in the UEFA Euro 1988 qualifying; a 1–0 shock home win over Bulgaria and a 1–1 draw to Denmark in the 1990 FIFA World Cup qualification; and a heroic 3–2 comeback victory over Portugal. However, Greece suffered from shortage of quality strikers and its defence was largely disorganized at best, resulting in Greece botching important games and thus failed to qualify.\n\n\n\n### 1994 World Cup[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **possibly contains original research**.

Statements consisting only of original research should be removed. *(May 2023)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*\n |\n\n\nThe team's success in qualifying for the 1994 FIFA World Cup in the United States, marked the first time they had made it to the FIFA World Cup finals.[13] Greece finished first and undefeated in their qualifying group, surpassing Russia in the final game. In the final tournament Greece were drawn into Group D with Nigeria, Bulgaria, and Argentina. After the successful qualifying campaign, expectations back in Greece were high as no one could imagine the oncoming astounding failure.[14] Most notable reason for this complete failure was the fact that Alketas Panagoulias opted to take a squad full of those players – though most of them aging and out of form – that helped the team in the qualifying instead of new emerging talents seeing it as a reward for their unprecedented success. Furthermore, they had the disadvantage of being drawn into a \"group of death\", with runners-up at the 1990 FIFA World Cup Argentina, later semifinalists Bulgaria, and Nigeria, one of the strongest African teams. It is worth mentioning that all players of the squad, including the three goalkeepers, took part in those three games, something very rare. This tournament was humiliating for the Greece squad, though it was understandable (if not say predictable) given its maiden appearance and the vast disparity of quality of opponents. In their first game against Argentina at Foxboro Stadium just outside Boston, they lost 4–0. Four days later Greece suffered another 4–0 blow from Bulgaria at Soldier Field in Chicago, and then, in what would be their final game, they lost to Nigeria 2–0 at Foxboro Stadium again. In the end, Greece were eliminated in the first round by losing all three games, scoring no goals and conceding ten.\n\n\n\n### Near misses[edit]\n\n\nGreece failed to qualify for the Euro 1996 finishing third in the group behind Russia and Scotland. In their 1998 World Cup qualifying tournament the team finished only one point shy of second-placed Croatia after a 0–0 draw by the eventual Group winners, the Danish. Croatia and Denmark would make the Semi-Finals and Quarter-Finals respectively, of that World Cup. In their Euro 2000 qualifying group, Greece finished again in third place, two points behind second-placed Slovenia in a highly disappointing campaign that saw the team lose at home to Latvia. In the 2002 World Cup qualifying Greece finished a disappointing fourth in their group behind England, Germany and Finland, which led to the sacking of coach Vasilis Daniil,[15] replaced by Otto Rehhagel. Highlights of the campaign included a 5–1 defeat in Finland and the 2–2 draw that followed in England, the first of two games the Greece national team would be under the reins of the German coach.\n\n\n\n### European Champions: Euro 2004 triumph[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Greece line-up in Euro 2004\n![](image)Vasilis Tsiartas\n![](image)Thodoris Zagorakis, captain of the national team and \"player of the tournament\" in Euro 2004.\n#### Qualification[edit]\n\n\nGreece started the UEFA Euro 2004 qualification campaign with defeats at home to Spain and away to Ukraine, both with a 2–0 scoreline. The team went on to win their remaining six games, including a 1–0 away win over Spain in Zaragoza, securing first place in the group and an appearance in the European Championship finals for the first time in 24 years.\n\n\n\n#### Before the tournament[edit]\n\n\nGreece were the second-least favorite in the competition to win, with Latvia being the least favorite. Greece were also considered as outsiders and underdogs and were given odds of 150–1 of winning before the tournament.[16] They were drawn in Group A, ending up with Portugal, Spain and Russia, a \"group of death\"; Portugal, hosts and favourites to win, Spain, former European champions, and Russia, who won the first-ever Euro as the Soviet Union. Very few people expected Greece to proceed to the quarter-finals, let alone win the tournament.\n\n\n\n#### Group stage[edit]\n\n\nIn the opening match against hosts Portugal, Greece achieved a surprise 2–1 victory,[17] receiving the nickname \"pirate ship\" (Το Πειρατικό) used by Greek sportscasters in reference to the floating ship used in the tournament's opening ceremony. Greece won with a 25-yard strike by Giorgos Karagounis and a penalty by Angelos Basinas. Four days later, Greece stunned Spain in front of a largely Spanish crowd with a 1–1 draw after being down 1–0 at half time.[18] Greece fell behind from a defensive lapse, which allowed Fernando Morientes to score. However a sublime diagonal pass by playmaker Vasilis Tsiartas allowed Angelos Charisteas to score an equaliser in the second half, giving Greece hope of qualifying. In the final group match Greece fell behind 2–0 to Russia (who were already eliminated) within the first ten minutes of the game but managed to pull one back through Zisis Vryzas and thus progressed to the next round, at the expense of Spain, on goals scored. Dmitri Kirichenko had the chance to eliminate Greece in the final minutes of this match, but his stretched effort squeezed just wide.\n\n\n\n#### Quarter-finals[edit]\n\n\nIn the quarter-finals Greece faced off with the undefeated and reigning champions France. At 65 minutes Greece took the lead. Angelos Basinas played a perfect pass to captain Thodoris Zagorakis, who flicked the ball high in the air, past veteran French defender Bixente Lizarazu, and sent a perfect cross to Angelos Charisteas for the header and goal. Greece held on to win despite a late French onslaught, with close efforts by Thierry Henry, thus knocking France out of Euro 2004 and becoming the first team ever to defeat both the hosts and defending champions in the same tournament.[19]\n\n\n\n#### Semi-finals[edit]\n\n\nGreece reached the semi-finals to face the Czech Republic, who were the only team to defeat all of their opponents to that point. The Czech record included a convincing 3–2 win over the Netherlands, a 2–1 win over Germany, and a 3–0 win over Denmark in the quarter-finals. At this stage in the tournament the Czechs were favourites to take the trophy. The game began nervously for Greece, as the Czech Republic applied much pressure. Tomáš Rosický hit the bar in the opening minutes, and Jan Koller had several efforts saved by Antonis Nikopolidis. The Czechs chances were dealt a blow when influential midfielder Pavel Nedvěd left the pitch injured in the first half. After 90 minutes the game ended 0–0, despite the Czechs having most of the game's missed chances. In the final minute of the first half of extra time, a close range silver goal header by Traianos Dellas from a Vasilis Tsiartas corner ended the Czech campaign, putting Greece into the final of Euro 2004 and sending their fans into euphoria.[20][21][22]\n\n\n\n#### Final[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2004 Final\n\n![](image)Angelos Charisteas scoring Greece's winning goal in the Euro 2004 final.\n![](image)\n\n\n\n**Nikopolidis**\n**Kapsis**\n**Dellas**\n**Seitaridis**\n**Fyssas**\n**Katsouranis**\n**Zagorakis (C)**\n**Basinas**\n**Charisteas**\n**Giannakopoulos**\n**Vryzas**\nGreece starting line-up against Portugal at the UEFA Euro 2004 Final.\n\nFor the first time in history the final was a repeat of the opening match, with Greece and hosts Portugal facing off in a rematch. In the 57th minute Charisteas gave Greece the lead with a header from a corner by Angelos Basinas.[23] Portugal had much of the possession, but the Greece defence was solid and dealt with most attacks. Cristiano Ronaldo had a good chance to equalise in the dying moments, but could not apply a finish. Greece held on to win 1–0, winning the tournament, an achievement considered by many to be one of the greatest football upsets in history, if not the greatest.[24][25][26] Greece captain Zagorakis was named the player of the tournament, having led Greece and made the most tackles in the entire tournament.[27]\n\n\n\n#### Recognition[edit]\n\n\nGreece's victory shot them up in the FIFA World Rankings from 35th in June 2004 to 14th in July 2004. This is one of the largest upward moves in a single month in the top echelon of the rankings. The triumph of Greece at Euro 2004 is the biggest sporting achievement in the country's history for a team sport, along with the successes of the Greece national basketball team in the European Championships of 1987, 2005 and 2006 FIBA World Championship and the World Championship title of Greece women's national water polo team in 2011. The team has appeared on stamps and received medals from Konstantinos Stephanopoulos (the President of Greece), Archbishop Christodoulos of Athens, and an ecstatic ovation from the country's population which came out to see the team drive with the trophy from the Athens airport to the Panathenaic Stadium where the Greek political and religious leadership was awaiting them.[28][29][30][31] The Euro 2004 winners were selected as \"World Team of the Year\" at the 2005 Laureus World Sports Award for Team of the Year.[32]\n\n\n\n### 2005 Confederations Cup[edit]\n\n\nAs European champions, Greece qualified for the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup in Germany and were drawn into Group B along with 2002 FIFA World Cup champions Brazil, 2004 AFC Asian Cup champions Japan, and 2003 CONCACAF Gold Cup champions Mexico. Greece lost their first two matches 3–0 to Brazil and 1–0 to Japan before drawing 0–0 with Mexico to finish at the bottom of the group. The squad included players such as Stathis Tavlaridis, Loukas Vyntra, Michalis Sifakis, Giannis Amanatidis and Fanis Gekas, all of whom earned their first call ups or maiden caps in the national squad.\n\n\n\n### 2006 World Cup qualifying[edit]\n\n\nAfter winning the Euro 2004, Greece faced Ukraine, Turkey, Denmark, Albania, Georgia and Kazakhstan in Group 2 of the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification tournament. Greece opened their campaign with a 2–1 loss to Albania in Tirana before draws with Turkey (0–0) and Ukraine (1–1) followed by a 3–1 victory over Kazakhstan.\n\n\nIn 2005, Greece resumed their campaign with three victories, defeating Denmark 2–1; Georgia 3–1; and Albania 2–0; before earning a goalless away draw with Turkey. Just prior to the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup, Greece lost 1–0 at home to Ukraine after a late goal from Andriy Husin.[33] Following a 2–1 away win against Kazakhstan, the team experienced a setback after a 1–0 defeat to Denmark in Copenhagen diminished their chances of qualification.\n\n\nIn their last game, Greece defeated Georgia, finishing in fourth place, four points behind first-placed Ukraine, two behind Turkey, and a point behind Denmark. Throughout the match, fans in the Karaiskakis Stadium chanted the name of Otto Rehhagel in their utmost support and he said afterwards *\"Even if 10 years pass, part of my heart will be Greek\"*.[34]\n\n\n\n### Euro 2008[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Greece vs Spain in Red Bull Arena during UEFA Euro 2008.\nGreece was the highest-ranked seed for the UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying tournament and was drawn with Turkey, Norway, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Hungary, Moldova and Malta.\n\n\nThey began their Euro 2008 qualification campaign with victories over Moldova, Norway and Bosnia and Herzegovina before suffering a 4–1 home loss against Turkey in Athens. Greece went on to win away to Malta, with the only goal coming in the 66th minute from an Angelos Basinas penalty, beat Hungary and Moldova at home and drew 2–2 away to Norway despite having hit the goalpost three times in this match. The draw in Oslo was followed by a 3–2 home win against Bosnia-Herzegovina and a 1–0 away win to Turkey, securing its presence to the Euro 2008 finals at their old rival's home ground.[35] In the last two matches, Greece overcame Malta 5–0 in Athens and defeated Hungary with an away 2–1 win, finishing first in their group with a total of 31 points, the most points gained among any team in qualifying.\n\n\nAs defending European champions, Greece were top seed for the final tournament and were drawn with Sweden, Spain, and Russia in Group D.\n\n\nIn the tournament, Greece team lost all three games and scored only one goal. Greece underperformed in the opening match against Sweden and lost 2–0 before losing 1–0 to Russia. Having already been eliminated, Angelos Charisteas opened the scoring for Greece against Spain, but lost 2–1, becoming the first defending champion not to earn a single point in the next European Championship.\n\n\n\n### 2010 World Cup[edit]\n\n\nDespite the scoring prowess of Europe's top 2010 World Cup qualifying goal-scorer Fanis Gekas—who produced 10 goals in as many games—Greece took second place to Switzerland in Group 2 of UEFA qualification, thus advancing to a home-and-away playoff round, where they faced Ukraine. After a scoreless draw at home in the first match, the second leg in Donetsk saw Greece triumph with a 1–0 win, sending the Greece to the 2010 FIFA World Cup.[36] At the 2010 World Cup draw in Cape Town, South Africa on 4 December 2009, Greece found itself grouped with two familiar opponents from its first World Cup appearance in 1994. Argentina and Nigeria were yet again drawn into group stage play alongside Greece, this time into Group B with South Korea replacing Greece's third 1994 opponent, Bulgaria.[37]\n\n\nIn its World Cup opener, Greece lost 2–0 to South Korea after a dismal performance characterized by excessive long-ball attacks and a lack of offensive creativity. In the second fixture against Nigeria, Greece won 2–1,[38] coming from behind after conceding an early goal. Dimitris Salpingidis scored Greece's first-ever goal in the World Cup finals in the 44th minute of the first half to tie the match at 1–1.[39] Vasilis Torosidis scored the winning goal in the 71st minute, securing the first points and first victory for Greece in tournament history. In the third match against heavily favoured Argentina, Greece needed a combination of results to advance to the next round. As expected, in what would be his final game as Greece's national team head coach, Otto Rehhagel conjured up a very defensive-minded strategy, leaving Georgios Samaras with nearly all offensive responsibilities as the lone striker. The strategy nearly paid off in the second half with the score still locked at 0–0 when Samaras beat the last Argentine defender on a quick long-ball counter-attack but curled a rushed shot just wide of the far post. Greece held Argentina scoreless until the 77th minute but ultimately lost 2–0, finishing third in Group B.\n\n\nGreece moved from 13th to 12th in the FIFA World Rankings following the tournament. Russia, Croatia and France dropped lower than Greece while Uruguay and Chile jumped ahead of\n\n\n\n![](image)Fernando Santos\nTwenty-four hours removed from Greece's World Cup loss to Argentina, Otto Rehhagel stepped away from his post as Greece national team manager.[40] Eight days later a new era in Greece football was ushered in as the Hellenic Football Federation named former AEK Athens and PAOK boss Fernando Santos the new manager.[41] Under Santos the Greece immediately went to work on an unprecedented streak of success, setting a senior-club record by going unbeaten in Santos' first seventeen matches as manager. While Greece's proficiency in stifling opposition attacks seemed to wane toward the end of Rehhagel's tenure, the emergence of Santos seemed to galvanize Greece defending once more. Through seven international friendlies and ten Euro 2012 qualifiers, Greece kept nine clean sheets and conceded just one goal in each of the remaining eight contests. From start to end of their unbeaten run, Santos' national side moved from No. 12 to No. 8 in FIFA's world rankings, equaling the highest mark in history credited by FIFA to Greece. Only one match from their streak featured a team (other than Greece) that appeared at the 2010 World Cup, a 1–0 defeat of Serbia in Belgrade.\n\n\n\n### Euro 2012[edit]\n\n\n#### Qualifying[edit]\n\n\nWith its late-game comeback victory over Georgia in October 2011, Greece padded its historic football tournament résumé, most importantly by sealing an automatic berth into UEFA's 2012 European Football Championship tournament. For the second time in team history the national side won its qualifying group for a major football tournament without a single loss incurred, as Greece also went undefeated in 1994 World Cup qualifiers. Adding to its 1980, 2004 and 2008 Euro qualifying campaigns, the Georgia triumph marked the fifth time overall that Greece has won its qualification group for a major tournament. Although their tendency to produce positive results remained steady throughout qualifying, so too did the Greece proclivity to start games slowly and concede early goals. This habit would plague Greece through qualifying and eventually tarnish their Euro 2012 performances.\n\n\nOver two qualifying contests, Greece trailed Georgia on the scoreboard for 130 of 180 minutes and still managed to grab four of six possible points in the standings by way of three late strikes. Goals scored in the dying minutes of games, often coming from defenders, became somewhat of a Greek signature on Group F's table. In fact Greece was able to take and keep a first-half lead just once in ten games, the 3–1 home defeat of Malta which was ranked 50th of 53 teams in Europe. In Malta, a last-second tie-breaking strike from defender Vasilis Torosidis pocketed a crucial extra two points in the standings for Greece, the same number of points it held over Croatia at the end of qualifying. Despite allowing weaker teams in the group to bring the game to them, Greece admirably held powerful Croatia scoreless through two meetings and deservedly won Group F four days after a decisive 2–0 home win versus the second-place Croats. Fanis Gekas, who retired from national team service in 2010 after Fernando Santos' third game as manager, came out of retirement in time to contribute a goal to the result. Gekas was eventually included in Santos's 23-man Euro 2012 roster, leaving out Euro 2004 hero Angelos Charisteas who scored the group-clinching goal in the aforementioned Greece qualifying victory in Georgia.\n\n\n\n#### Group stage in Poland[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Greece players singing the Greece national anthem in Euro 2012 opening match against the hosts Poland (1–1).\n\"Shades of 2004\" was a commonly perceived theme regarding the buildup to Euro 2012 for Greece and their progression through the tournament. As in 2004 Greece was drawn into the same group as the host nation, Poland on this occasion, and also had the pressure of playing in the tournament's opening match. Two familiar foes from its 2004 championship run, Russia and Czech Republic, joined Greece and Poland in Group A on 2 December 2011 at the tournament's final draw in Kiev. Upon drawing the lowest-ranked teams from Pots 1 and 2 as well as the second-lowest from Pot 4, Greece's prospects of passing the group stage at Euro 2012 were given a boost.\n\n\nIdeas of steering \"To Piratiko\" to a dream start in host-nation territory as Greece did in Portugal eight years before, rapidly turned sour during the opening match's first half. From the outset Greece appeared uncomfortable holding the ball for long spells and seemed content to allow hosts Poland to push numbers forward with the ball, hoping to score through counter-attacks. However, Poland made the most of its early possession, as top scorer Robert Lewandowski converted a header from a goal line cross past a scurrying Kostas Chalkias. Hope and momentum continued to tip in favor of Poland when Sokratis Papastathopoulos received his second yellow card of the game in just the 44th minute from Spanish referee Carlos Velasco Carballo. Greece began to boss the game after halftime while playing down a man. Dimitris Salpingidis made the greatest impact on the game for Greece as a second-half substitute, making brilliant penetrating runs behind the Polish defense, eventually bringing the game level 1–1 on a mistake by Poland keeper Wojciech Szczęsny. Salpingidis was then responsible for levelling up the numbers for Greece when Szczęsny made a red-card foul on Salpingidis' breakaway attempt on goal in the 68th minute. But Greece captain Giorgos Karagounis' subsequent penalty kick was turned away by substitute keeper Przemysław Tytoń. A second goal by Salpingidis was disallowed as he was assisted by an offside Kostas Fortounis, denying Greece's best opportunity to take three points from what ended as an improbable 1–1 draw.\n\n\nThe Czech Republic exploited Greece's weakness at the left-defender position early in the second group stage match, notching two goals in the first six minutes. Just as Poland had, the Czechs repeatedly penetrated Greece back line behind left-side defender José Cholevas, scoring on a through-ball and a cross from Cholevas' side. Petr Čech's gaffe on a Georgios Samaras cross in the second half turned into a gift goal for Fanis Gekas. The Czechs then eased off on their early pressure, opting to sit back and guard their lead for much of the second half, but Gekas' goal was too little too late. Greece lost the match 2–1, placing them at the foot of Group A in need of a victory over the attack-minded Russians to advance to the knockout rounds.\n\n\nAfter thrashing the Czech Republic 4–1 and displaying more offensive potency in a 1–1 draw with Poland, the Russians were favored to earn the one point they needed to advance against the Greeks, especially since defeating the team in both of the previous two European Championships. However, Greece delivered a trademark 1–0 defensive victory and advanced to the Euro 2012 quarterfinals.[42] Greece scored when Russia defender Sergei Ignashevich errantly headed a Greece throw-in behind the Russian defense for Giorgos Karagounis to pounce on. Greece's captain sprinted in on goal and struck the ball at the back post under keeper Vyacheslav Malafeev in first-half stoppage time to send the Russians reeling into the locker rooms. Ignashevich appeared to have conceded an additional golden scoring opportunity for Greece upon tripping Karagounis in the Russian penalty area early in the second half, but referee Jonas Eriksson instead booked Karagounis for what he believed to be simulation. This being Karagounis' second yellow card of the tournament, Greece was to be without its suspended captain in the next round. With that victory, Greece qualified to the quarterfinals for a second time after their successful Euro 2004 campaign.\n\n\n\n#### Quarter-finals[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Greece played against Germany for a place in the semi-finals of Euro 2012 but they were eliminated after a 4–2 loss in the quarter-final match.\nIn the quarter-finals, Greece met with a Germany side that won all three of its group matches against Portugal, Denmark and the Netherlands. Greece applied very little pressure in the midfield in the opening period, slowing the tempo of the game and affording Germany the majority of possession. Young Sotiris Ninis switched off momentarily in defence, allowing German captain Philipp Lahm to cut infield and open the scoring with a long-distance strike. Greece remained calm as in Georgios Samaras they carried a constant threat. On the counter-attack, they pulled level early in the second half; regaining possession in their defensive third, Giorgos Fotakis found Dimitris Salpingidis streaking 40 yards deep into German territory. Salpingidis delivered a ball five yards in front of goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, which Samaras was able to meet and power underneath Neuer for the equalizer. Twenty minutes later, however, the Germans led 4–1. Greece scored an 89th-minute penalty kick by Salpingidis, but the match ended 4–2 to the Germans, ending Greece's Euro 2012 campaign.\n\n\n\n### 2014 World Cup[edit]\n\n\n#### Qualifying[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Greece national team in 2013\nTo reach the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, Greece had to contend with a team on the rise in Bosnia and Herzegovina and a dangerous Slovakian side seemingly in decline since its memorable 2010 World Cup qualifying and finals performances. Latvia, a familiar qualification foe for Greece in its previous two major tournaments (2010 World Cup, Euro 2012), joined the fray as well. Ahead of those aforesaid tournaments, Bosnia twice narrowly missed out on its first major international tournament appearance due to consecutive playoff defeats at the hands of Portugal. No playoff would be necessary for Bosnia in 2013, as it won its qualifying group over Greece on goal difference. The decisive match was in Bosnia on 22 March, when Greece succumbed to three set-piece goals (two free-kick headers and one penalty miss rebound) in a 3–1 defeat. Greece's defense proved rigid throughout qualifying, conceding zero goals in open play. Four goals were allowed by Greece in ten games, the first of which was a penalty by Latvia, and yet four goals were too many for a relatively unproductive Grece attack to overcome. Though Greece was shut out just once, the team only managed to score 12 goals, an output Bosnia reached in its second game.\n\n\nFollowing group play Romania, which claimed second place over Hungary and Turkey in a group dominated by the Dutch, awaited Greece in a two-legged playoff. The last time the two sides met in late 2011, Romania came into Greece and dealt Fernando Santos his first defeat as Greece manager in his 18th game at the helm. Greece reversed the prior 3–1 result in their favour this time, scoring each goal through skillful one-touch passing and finishing. Kostas Mitroglou accounted for three of Greece's four goals in a 4–2 aggregate playoff victory, though none were actual game-winners. Dimitris Salpingidis notched the game winner in Athens, while the second leg finished 1–1 in Bucharest.[43]\n\n\n\n#### Finals[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Arena das Dunas before the Japan vs Greece match.\nAracaju was chosen as the team's base camp for the tournament in Brazil.[44][45][46] Greece was drawn into Group C with Colombia, Côte d'Ivoire and Japan and ultimately created an extraordinarily similar tournament experience as it did two years prior at Euro 2012. Greece conceded an early goal in their first game against Colombia, but Panagiotis Kone narrowly missed equalizing just one minute after Colombia's fifth-minute goal. Trailing 2–0 in the 63rd minute, Fanis Gekas' header from six yards struck the crossbar for Greece's best chance of the match. The Colombians proved to be the more clinical finishers, prevailing 3–0 despite an even number of shots for both teams and a slight possession advantage in Greece's favor.[47] To stave off the threat of elimination, the Greece needed to earn at least a point in their second match with Japan, who sat alongside them at the bottom of Group C. The task grew more difficult once captain Kostas Katsouranis received two yellow cards, reducing Greece to ten men in the 38th minute. Greece held out for a 0–0 draw and remained tied with Japan on points. The draw made it necessary for Greece to defeat Ivory Coast in their final group match in order to reach the round of 16 for the first time in their history. An early injury to midfielder Panagiotis Kone brought on young Olympiacos midfielder Andreas Samaris, who would score his first international goal after intercepting a poor back-pass by an Ivorian defender. Swansea City striker Wilfried Bony equalized for Ivory Coast in the 73rd minute. In the first minute of stoppage time, Ivory Coast striker Giovanni Sio obstructed a Samaras shot by clipping him from behind in the Ivorian penalty area, resulting in a Greece penalty kick which Samaras converted with 30 seconds remaining in the game, prompting wild celebrations in Greece.[48]\n\n\nAs Group C runners-up Greece was paired in the round of 16 with Group D shock winners Costa Rica, who won their first-ever World Cup group stage ahead of former world champions Uruguay, Italy and England. Trailing 1–0 but handed an advantage by the dismissal of Costa Rican Óscar Duarte, Greece forced extra time through a Sokratis Papastathopoulos equalizer ten seconds into stoppage time. This was the only goal that Costa Rica goalkeeper Keylor Navas conceded in open play throughout the tournament. Navas thwarted several opportunities for Greece throughout the 30 minutes of extra time and saved Fanis Gekas' penalty in the game's concluding penalty shootout. Costa Rica claimed its first World Cup knockout stage victory and denied Greece its first by defeating Greece 5–3 on penalties.\n\n\n\n### Post Brazil 2014[edit]\n\n\n#### Euro 2016 qualifying: Reorganization and decline[edit]\n\n\nThe team appointed Claudio Ranieri as head coach in July 2014. He was sacked in November of the same year after a shocking home defeat to the Faroe Islands.[49] Sergio Markarián was appointed in his place, but he too has come under fire, after the team's terrible performances in the remaining UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying. The team's form after September 2014 proved to be abysmal, with no wins in over a year. Greece finished in bottom place in their Euro Qualifying group, earning just one victory against Hungary in the final round, and failing to qualify for the tournament. Greece, along with the Netherlands and Bosnia and Herzegovina were the only nations from Pot 1 not to qualify for the finals. Those three had taken part in the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Incidentally, the three teams would also fail to qualify for the World Cup in 2018.\n\n\n\n#### 2018 World Cup qualifying: Resurgence[edit]\n\n\nIn attempting to qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Greece would suffer a second successive failure to reach a major tournament, despite improvements and some positive results. They finished second in Group H of the European qualifying stages, nine points behind runaway leaders Belgium and two points clear of third placed Bosnia and Herzegovina. Greece were subsequently drawn against Croatia in the play-off round, where they were knocked out over two legs; a 4–1 away defeat set the tone for Greece's campaign, and in the second leg they drew a blank in a 0–0 stalemate against the Croats to signify the end of their World Cup hopes.[50]\n\n\n\n#### 2018–19 Nations League and Euro 2020 qualifying: Inconsistency, fall and promising finish[edit]\n\n\nGreece had to start their UEFA Nations League in League C due to previously poor performance. Greece won and lost three games each to these opponents altogether, and only finished third in the Nations League and was unable to promote to League B when the UEFA revised the format.\n\n\nGreece's qualification campaign for UEFA Euro 2020 commenced with the team being placed in Group J. Due to disappointing results, John van 't Schip decided not to call-up some of the leading members of the squad, such as Sokratis Papastathopoulos and Kostas Manolas for their final matches. A more youthful Greek showed a massive improvement in their attacking and pressing style of play. In the final three games Greece achieved successive victories. Greece finished third in the final table but this was still not enough to earn a play-off spot.\n\n\n\n#### 2020–21 Nations League and 2022 World Cup Qualifying[edit]\n\n\nHaving been forced to remain in League C due to poor performance, Greece had to start its campaign on their quest to be promoted. Greece needed a win in the last game against Slovenia at home to achieve promotion to League B. The match ended on 0-0, with Greece failing to promote a second consecutive time, despite being unbeaten and having conceded just one goal.\n\n\nGreece was put in Group B for the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers. The campaign started with an upset away 1–1 draw against group favourites Spain, but was followed by two 1-1 draws to Georgia at home and Kosovo away. A 2–1 home win over Sweden kept the hopes for qualification alive, and was followed by a 2–0 away win against Georgia. At the crucial away match in Stockholm, Greece made a good performance in the first half but eventually lost 2–0 to Sweden. Another loss, 1–0 at home to group winners Spain ratified Greece's elimination from the finals, with Greece failing to qualify for a World Cup for the second consecutive time.\n\n\n\n### 2022–23 UEFA Nations League[edit]\n\n\nUnder the instructions of manager Gus Poyet, Greece had a successful run in the Group C2 of the 2022–23 competition. The *Galanolefki* secured promotion to League B by topping the group ahead of Kosovo, Northern Ireland and Cyprus.\n\n\n\n## Home stadium[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Karaiskakis Stadium in Piraeus, the home ground of Greece from 2004 until 2017.\nTraditionally, Greece have spent most of their history playing their home matches in different stadiums primarily in or near Athens, but also in a number of other cities around the country. The home ground of the national team was the Karaiskakis Stadium in Piraeus, since its reconstruction in 2004 until 2017.[51]\n\n\nSince their first international fixture in 1929 and for the next 33 years, Greece regularly used Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium as their home ground. Their first home match away from it was played at the Nikos Goumas Stadium in 1962, while the Karaiskakis Stadium was used for the first time in 1964, when it was renovated. In 1966, Kaftanzoglio Stadium in Thessaloniki became the first stadium outside of the Athens area to be used. Since then all of these stadiums were alternately used until the early 1980s, while a few other stadiums were inaugurated by the national team as well such as Thessaloniki's Toumba Stadium and Harilaou Stadium in 1975 and 1977 respectively. Greece also held matches at other home grounds outside of the two major cities in 1976, such as Panachaiki Stadium in Patras and Kavala Stadium in Kavala. In 1982, Georgios Kamaras Stadium was added to the list of home grounds for the national team, the first in Athens out of the three major stadiums.\n\n\nOn 16 November 1983, the newly built Athens Olympic Stadium, to date the largest stadium in the country, housed the national team for the first time in a qualifier for UEFA Euro 1984 against Denmark. It served as the primary home ground for the team for the rest of the 1980s and the 1990s, until 2001 when it was closed for renovations. Meanwhile, a large number of matches were held in various stadiums including old choices and some new in provincial cities all over the country, something that did not change until the early 2000s, when the Athens Olympic Stadium was almost abandoned. From the start of the 2000 until the qualifiers games of Euro 2004, the Greek National Team uses Leoforos Stadium as its home. Since 2004 Greece has mainly used Karaiskakis Stadium, with very few of Greece's matches being played in other stadiums. They returned to OAKA in 2018 for a friendly against Switzerland and announced they would play their home matches for the new UEFA Nations League there, as well.[52] For the UEFA Euro 2020 qualifiers, they were slated to split time between OAKA in Athens, and the Pankritio Stadium in Heraklion on the island of Crete, but with the latter requiring upgrades to be fit for FIFA standards, the entire campaign was held in Athens. They remained at OAKA until 2021, before making a temporary move to the Georgios Kamaras Stadium in late 2021 for the UEFA Nations League campaign, also hosting two matches in Volos.\n\n\nOn 7 March 2023, it was announced that the new Agia Sophia Stadium in the Nea Filadelfeia section of Athens would become the new home of the Ethniki.\n\n\n\n## Team image[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Greece national football team kits.\n\nGreece's traditional colours are blue and white, originating from the Greece flag. Although blue was used as the home kit since the team's inception, white became the primary home color following UEFA Euro 2004. In recent decades, Greece wear either a set of white jerseys, shorts and socks, or an all-blue combination. Formerly, the kit consisted of a combination of blue jerseys and white shorts and vice versa. Meanwhile, Greece's kit has occasionally featured stripes, crosses or other designs, as well as various values of blue.\n\n\nOn 10 April 2013, the Hellenic Football Federation announced a partnership with American manufacturer Nike, which is Greece's current official supplier, with their first kit debuting on 7 June 2013 in the away match to Lithuania.[53][54] On 4 March 2014, Greece unveiled their latest kit also worn at the 2014 FIFA World Cup.[55]\n\n\nThe crest (*εθνόσημο* means \"national sign\"),[56] which is used in the kit, is the official emblem of the national team.[57]\n\n\n\n### Kit sponsorship[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Supplier\n | Period\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![Japan](image) Asics | 1980–1981\n |\n| ![West Germany](image) Puma | 1982–1987\n |\n| ![West Germany](image) Adidas | 1988–1989\n |\n| ![Japan](image) Asics | 1989–1991\n |\n| ![Italy](image) Diadora | 1991–1998\n |\n| ![Italy](image) Lotto | 1998–2001\n |\n| ![France](image) Le Coq Sportif | 2001–2003\n |\n| ![Germany](image) Adidas | 2003–2012\n |\n| ![United States](image) Nike | 2013–present\n |\n\n\n### Nicknames[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Flag of Greece held by fans\nTraditionally, Greece is referred to by the media and the Greeks in general simply as *Ethniki* (Εθνική) in Greek, which literally means 'National'. The team is often called *Galanolefki* (Sky blue-white) due to the use of the colours of the Greece flag as kit colours. Both nicknames are used for the country's national teams in other sports as well.\n\n\nDuring the opening ceremony at the UEFA Euro 2004, which took place right before the inaugural game of the tournament between Greece and hosts Portugal, a replica of a 16th-century ship was used referring to the expeditions of the Portuguese explorers of that time. Greek radio sports journalist Georgios Helakis, while broadcasting the opening match, commented that *\"since the Portuguese team appeared in such a ship, it's time for us to become pirates and steal the victory\"*. Eventually, Greece beat the hosts and the team was described as *Piratiko*, meaning the 'Pirate ship', which emerged as the new nickname of the team repeated at every win during the tournament. Especially after Greece won in the final to Portugal, the new nickname was established to commemorate the coronation of Greece as European champions.\n\n\n\n### Rivalries[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Greece–Turkey football rivalry\n\nGreece has a historical rivalry with Turkey; having played them a total of 13 matches, winning three, drawing three and losing seven games.[58] Both countries have been described as \"punching above their weight\"; with Greece winning Euro 2004 despite being classified as underdogs prior to the competition, and Turkey followed-up their World Cup semi-final appearance in 2002 by advancing to the semi-finals of Euro 2008, where they were knocked out by Germany. The relationship with Turkey is very intense overall. It is fueled by a dispute between the two countries, the dispute over Cyprus, and several incidents occurring during matches between Turkish and Greece clubs, it has been described as one of the international football rivalries.[59]\n\n\nGreece has also a football rivalry with Romania, because it is the team that has been met the most times in their history (36 times). Greece has won 8 matches and Romania has won 18 matches (10 matches between them ended in draw).\n\n\n\n### Media coverage[edit]\n\n\nGreece's qualifying matches and friendlies are currently televised by Nova Sports and Alpha TV, a trademark of Digea.\n\n\n\n## Results and fixtures[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Greece national football team results (2020–present)\n\nThe following is a list of match results in the last 12 months, as well as any future matches that have been scheduled.\n\n\n  Win\n  Draw\n  Loss\n  Fixture\n\n\n\n### 2022[edit]\n\n\nHungary ![](image) v ![](image) Greece\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 20 November 2022 Friendly |  **Hungary ![](image)**  | **2–1** |  **![](image) Greece**  | Budapest, Hungary |\n| 18:00 UTC+01:00 | ![](image) 15' Sallai  ![](image) 90+3' Kalmár | Report | ![](image) 81' (pen.)

It is controlled by the Danish Football Association (DBU), the governing body for the football clubs which are organised under DBU. Denmark's home stadium is Parken Stadium in the Østerbro district of Copenhagen; their head coach is Kasper Hjulmand.\n\n\nDenmark were the winners of the 1906 Intercalated Games football competition and silver medalists at the 1908 and 1912 Olympics. However, as amateurs who prohibited their internationals from becoming professionals at foreign clubs, Denmark did not qualify for the FIFA World Cup until 1986, although they won another Olympic silver in 1960.\n\n\nSince the 1980s and the \"Danish Dynamite\" team, Denmark has remained competitive in international tournaments. Triumph in the 1992 European Championship in Sweden marked the team's most prominent victory, defeating defending champions the Netherlands in the semi-final and world champions Germany in the final. They also won the 1995 King Fahd Cup, defeating Argentina in the final. Their best World Cup result was achieved in 1998, where they narrowly lost 3–2 in a quarter-final against Brazil. Denmark also made the round of 16 in 1986, 2002 and 2018. Most prominent result in recent history was at the UEFA Euro 2020 where the team lost in the semi-final against England after extra time.\n\n\n\n\n## Teams[edit]\n\n\nApart from the men's senior A-level team, Denmark competes with a women's national team, and has teams at various youth levels for both men and women, most prominently the under-21 national team. Historically, the A-level team competed in the Olympics until and including the 1988 tournament, whereafter Olympic games count as under-21 national games. In addition to the A-level team and youth teams, Denmark also has a special league national team named Ligalandsholdet, with the best Danish footballers from the Nordic leagues. Ligalandsholdet was created in January 1983, and has played unofficial games for the national team during the winter break of the Nordic leagues every year since, save for 2005 and 2011. Sometimes the media also refer to Ligalandsholdet as Denmark's B-team, as the best Danish footballers selected for the A-team often play in leagues outside of the Nordic countries. As such, the national team coach has on several occasions outlined the purpose of having unofficial matches played by Ligalandsholdet as an opportunity of testing new potential upcoming Danish players for the A-team.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Amateur years[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Danish team that won their first silver medal at the 1908 Summer Olympics.\n![](image)Danish team, winning the silver medals at the 1912 Olympics.\nOn 12 April 1896, Denmark XI defeated Podilatikos Syllogos Athinon, either 9–0 or 15–0, at the Neo Phaliron Velodrome in Athens in a demonstration game during the 1896 Olympic Games.[3]\n\n\nOn 18 April 1897, a game was played in Hamburg when a selection team from the Danish Football Association defeated a selection team from the Hamburg-Altona Football Association, 5–0 in the presence of 5,000 spectators.[4][5][6]\n\n\nThe first three editions of the Olympic football event in 1900–1906 had an unofficial status, as the event was not yet open for national football teams to compete, and only had limited participation of three or four club teams from a few nations. Denmark had no club team invited in the 1900 Olympics and the 1904 Olympics, but then received a special invitation for the 1906 Olympics, to compete against one Greek club team (Athens) and two club teams from the Ottoman Empire (Smyrna and Thessaloniki). The team to represent Denmark was compiled of players from the Copenhagen Football Association (KBU), and they won the event, and thereby an unofficial gold medal. Two years later, in the first official football tournament at the 1908 Olympics, Denmark won a silver medal. At the next Olympics, in 1912, the team again won a silver medal, which was followed by a golden era from July 1912 until August 1920, with Denmark ranked most of the time as number one in the world by the Elo ranking. The first official national football match was played on 19 October 1908 during the Olympic Games in London. Denmark beat France's second team 9–0 in the tournament's quarterfinals.\n\n\nAlthough Denmark figured fairly prominently in the pre-FIFA World Cup era, international success would elude them for years from the first World Cup in 1930 and forward. Despite the country's ability to produce outstanding football talents, the Danish Football Union (DBU) only had the ambition (or economy) to send the national team to play friendly matches and in the regional tournament, the Nordic Championship, from October 1920 until June 1948. When DBU opted to set their sights higher, they allowed the national team to start contesting the Olympics again, promptly resulting in a bronze medal at the 1948 Olympics. After, the team only reached the quarter-final at the 1952 Olympics, with the DBU choosing not to contest the next 1956 Olympics. As football remained an amateur past-time, most of the best Danish footballers moved abroad to make a living,[7] and due to DBU enforcing the rule to bar all professionals from the national team, it started to become difficult to assemble a highly competitive team.\n\n\nDenmark experienced their next revival at the 1960 Olympics with a third set of Olympic silver medals. This was followed by another notable performance at the 1964 European Nations' Cup, where Denmark impressively finished in fourth place. However, this finish was considered by many as being more the result of a comparatively easy draw rather than a result of a well-playing team. In order for Denmark to qualify for the semi-final, they only had to defeat Malta, Albania and Luxembourg. In the semi-final, Denmark fell 3–0 to the Soviet Union, then lost the third-place match to Hungary.\n\n\nThe strict rule of only allowing amateurism at the national team was finally abolished by the DBU in May 1971, as they had acknowledged this change was needed in order to build a highly competitive team. In February 1978, when the DBU also decided to allow professional football to be introduced in the Danish leagues, the way was at the same time paved for the national team to sign its first sponsorship with the well-known Danish brewery Carlsberg. The new sponsorship enabled the DBU to hire the German Sepp Piontek in July 1979 as the first full-time professional coach of the national team. The full transition of the national team from amateurism to professionalism had now been accomplished, and indeed, this would soon lead to a vast improvement in the performances of the team.[7]\n\n\nAccording to Rob Smyth and Lars Eriksen, authors of a book on the \"Danish Dynamite\" team that would soon emerge:\n\n\n\n\n> That process [the transition to professionalism] was accelerated by the fact that so many of the national team were playing abroad, and values learned there were slowly seeping in. ... Denmark got a headstart on football globalisation, benefiting from the enlightenment and experience that comes with playing abroad. At Euro 84, their 20-man squad contained 14 overseas-based players; the other seven teams had only five between them. At Mexico 86, their squad included players from the champions of Italy, West Germany, England, Holland and Belgium, but not Denmark.[8]\n> \n> \n\n\n### Danish Dynamite (1980–1990)[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1982 FIFA World Cup qualification, Denmark finished with eight points from eight matches, including a 3–1 win against the eventual World Cup champions Italy, but Denmark failed to qualify for the final tournament despite the impressive result. Qualification for UEFA Euro 1984 saw Denmark defeat England at Wembley Stadium when Allan Simonsen converted a penalty kick for a 1–0 win. Denmark qualified for their first international tournament since 1964, and the team was dubbed \"Danish Dynamite\" in a competition for the official Danish Euro 1984 song.[7] Denmark's participation ended in the semi-final when the team lost on penalties to Spain, most remembered for Preben Elkjær's penalty miss, his shorts torn apart. Following the strong performance at the finals, the name \"Danish Dynamite\" became a mainstay for the following decade of the Danish national team under head coach Sepp Piontek.[9]\n\n\nDenmark made their first World Cup appearance in the 1986 World Cup, and with the attacking duo of Michael Laudrup and Preben Elkjær, thrashed Uruguay 6–1. In the second round, Denmark once again faced Spain and once more lost, 5–1, including four goals by Emilio Butragueño. The first Spanish goal was caused by a miss-timed backpass by Jesper Olsen to Butragueño, an unfortunate action subsequently coined as \"a real Jesper Olsen\" (\"*en rigtig Jesper Olsen*\"). The phrase would live on for 13 years, and was repeated by the Danish TV commentators in 1999, when an identical backpass was carried out by Jesper Grønkjær to Filippo Inzaghi in Grønkjær's debut for the national team.[10]\n\n\nDenmark qualified for Euro 1988, and nearly made the 1988 Olympics. Richard Møller Nielsen guided Denmark to a secured spot for the final tournament – ahead of West Germany, but following the discovery that Dane Per Frimann was not eligible for the team's 2–0 win over Poland, Denmark was penalised, and subsequently failed to qualify. At Euro 1988, Denmark's participation ended in early defeat after Denmark lost all the group games to Spain 3-2, West Germany 2-0 and Italy 2-0. They then failed to qualify for the 1990 World Cup; Sepp Piontek resigned as head coach of the national team in April 1990, where he was replaced by Richard Møller Nielsen.\n\n\n\n### The Møller Nielsen fairytale: 1992 European Championship[edit]\n\n\nDenmark began Euro 1992 qualification with a secure home victory against the Faroe Islands, but the following results in the qualification were an away draw against Northern Ireland and a 2–0 home loss against Yugoslavia. Danes Michael Laudrup and Brian Laudrup opted to quit the national team in November 1990. When Nielsen subsequently decided to dismiss quality players such as Jan Mølby and Jan Heintze from the squad, due to disciplinary problems, several newspapers began demanding that Nielsen step down as head coach. Despite this, Denmark won the rest of their five matches in the qualification group, including a 2–1 away win against Yugoslavia. This was not enough to qualify, as the team still had to settle with a second place in the group, behind Yugoslavia.\n\n\nDue to international sanctions resulting from the Yugoslav wars, UEFA announced on 31 May 1992 – only ten days prior to the competition – that Yugoslavia was to be excluded from the competition and their place given to Denmark, who finished as the second-placed team in its qualifying group.[11]\n\n\nContrary to popular belief,[7] the team did not enter the tournament completely unprepared, after having rallied home from seaside vacations. The majority of players were already assembled to play a friendly match against the CIS when Denmark officially received Yugoslavia's spot.[12] Relying heavily on goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel and his defence, as well as creative spark Brian Laudrup – having decided to make a comeback for the national team in April 1992 – the Danish team created one of the biggest surprises in the event's history, as they went on to win the European Championship trophy under head coach Nielsen's defensive playing style. Advancing from the group stage ahead of England and France, Denmark defeated the Netherlands – the defending Euro 1988 champions – on penalties in the semi-final. Then, in the final, Denmark won 2–0 win against reigning World Cup champions Germany, ensuring Denmark its first international trophy.\n\n\n\n### Decline and revival (1993–2000)[edit]\n\n\nIn August 1993, Michael Laudrup decided to settle his ongoing dispute with Richard Møller Nielsen about the team tactics and made a comeback to the national team. However, the following years Denmark saw mixed results, as they first failed to qualify for the 1994 World Cup, but then won the 1995 Confederations Cup, beating Copa América champions Argentina 2–0 in the final. As defending champions at Euro 1996, Denmark disappointed with a lackluster performance after an early elimination in the group stage. The team had achieved a respectable win against Turkey, a draw against Portugal and only a defeat to Croatia.\n\n\nNielsen's replacement was Swede Bo \"Bosse\" Johansson, who gave the team a more offensive strategy, and the 1998 World Cup saw the revival of the Danish team, starring both Laudrup brothers in their last international campaign. After defeating Saudi Arabia 1–0, drawing with South Africa and losing 2–1 to eventual champions France, Denmark defeated Nigeria 4–1 in the round of 16. They exited in the quarterfinals with a 3–2 loss to Brazil.\n\n\nWithout the Laudrup brothers, Denmark qualified for Euro 2000, only to lose all three matches in the group stage.\n\n\n\n### The Olsen Gang (2000–2015)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)FIFA World Rankings for Denmark, August 1993 – July 2009\nMorten Olsen was named the new manager for Denmark in 2000 and the team was quickly dubbed the \"Olsen Gang\", a reference to the series of Danish movies based around the main character Egon Olsen and his genius (criminal) plans. The nickname was also used for the Danish team as an alternative to the more commonly used \"Danish Dynamite\", already in those days when Olsen played as a captain. Denmark's tactics shifted from the preferred 4–4–2 formation practised by Bo Johansson to an even more attacking style with an emphasis on the wingers available at the time, namely Jesper Grønkjær and Dennis Rommedahl.[13] Accordingly, the Olsen's preferred formation has been either a 4–3–3 or a 4–2–3–1.[14][15] Olsen even possessed an outspoken opposition to the 4–4–2 system, as he threatened to leave his position as head coach in the event he was asked to deploy Denmark in that formation.[16] To support the development of players for the new tactical 4–3–3 system, all national youth teams also changed their formation.[17] Another change Olsen brought to the national team was to stress the importance of only using fit players who had been granted regular playing time at their club. However, at times he was forced to compromise from this principle, as the pool of players available in the relatively small nation did not always provide him viable substitute options.\n\n\nDenmark qualified both for the 2002 World Cup and Euro 2004, but despite impressive results in the group stage in both tournaments, especially the 2–0 win against reigning World Cup winners France in 2002, Denmark failed to advance any further. At the 2002 World Cup, Denmark was defeated by England in the round of 16, and at Euro 2004, they were eliminated in the quarter-finals against the Czech Republic.\n\n\nFor the 2006 World Cup qualification, Denmark was paired with 2002 third place Turkey and eventual Euro 2004 champions Greece. Following a poor start to qualification, Denmark was trailing both Turkey and Ukraine. After failing to qualify for the 2006 World Cup, Morten Olsen considered leaving the job, having received several offers from club teams, but decided to stay and extended his contract until after the 2010 World Cup.[18]\n\n\nWhen Denmark's attempt to qualify for the Euro 2008 also failed, the team was heavily criticised. Despite this, Denmark qualified for the 2010 World Cup by winning the group, earning two wins against Sweden and four points against Portugal. Olsen's contract was extended for two further years, until Euro 2012.[19]\n\n\nAt the 2010 World Cup, Denmark was grouped with Japan, Cameroon and the Netherlands. Denmark lost the first match 2–0 to the Netherlands, but then scored a 2–1 victory against Cameroon. The game against Japan, however ended with a 3–1 defeat.\n\n\nIn qualification for Euro 2012, Denmark was once again grouped with Portugal; Denmark secured first place in the group, qualifying directly for the final tournament. Out of eight qualifying matches, Denmark won six, drew one and lost one, resulting Olsen's contract to be extended until after the 2014 World Cup.\n\n\nAt Euro 2012, Denmark were drawn in the proclaimed \"group of death\", Group B, alongside Germany, the Netherlands and Portugal. After defeating the Netherlands 1–0, they lost 3–2 to Portugal, requiring a win against Germany to advance in the tournament. Despite Michael Krohn-Dehli's equaliser, Denmark lost 2–1 to Germany, and with Portugal defeating the Netherlands 2–1, Denmark was eliminated from the tournament after finishing third in Group B.\n\n\nDenmark failed to qualify for the next two tournaments under Olsen. They finished second in their 2014 World Cup qualifying group but failed to achieve a play-off berth as they were the \"worst\" of the UEFA group runners-up (after excluding results against the bottom teams). In UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying they finished third in their group, behind Albania and eventual winners Portugal, but lost to Sweden in the play-offs.\n\n\nWhen measuring the performance of the national team by winning share and earned points, Olsen's reign of the Danish national team from July 2000 until January 2012 has so far been the second-most successful in the era of full-time professional coaches, which began in July 1979. As of January 2012, Olsen had a winning share of 52.8%, and with three points for a victory and one for a draw, an average of 1.84 points per match.[20] In comparison, Richard Møller Nielsen still has the best record among the professional coaches of the national team, with a 54.8% winning share and an average of 1.89 points per game.[21]\n\n\n\n### Hareide era: 2016–2020[edit]\n\n\nNew coach Åge Hareide presided over the Danish campaign during the qualification stages.[22] Denmark, ranked number 24 in the FIFA World Rankings at the time of the draw, were drawn into Group E, alongside Poland, Montenegro, Romania, Armenia, and Kazakhstan.[23]\nDespite suffering early defeats to Poland and Montenegro,[24][25] the Danes rallied, and secured second place in the group, and a berth in the play-offs, with a 1–0 away to Montenegro.[26] Denmark were rewarded for their second-place finish with a play-off against the Republic of Ireland.[27] Denmark secured qualification with a 5–1 win at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin, which included a hat-trick by Christian Eriksen, who added to his tally of eight goals in qualification.[28]\n\n\nDenmark were allocated into Pot 3 in advance of the draw for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.[29] They were drawn into Group C, alongside Australia, Peru, and France.[30] Their campaign in Russia began in the Mordovia Arena, Saransk, against Peru. A Yussuf Poulsen goal in the second half secured three points for the Danes.[31] However, they struggled against Australia in their second tie, as Christian Eriksen's early goal was cancelled out by a VAR-awarded penalty, converted by Mile Jedinak, in a game that ended 1–1.[32] Denmark secured qualification in their final group game, playing out the only goalless draw in the entire tournament,[33]\nin the Luzhniki Stadium against France; a result which saw both teams progress.[34]\n\n\nDenmark faced Croatia in the round of 16, with the Croats topping Group D with three wins.[35] Mathias Jørgensen scored within the first minute of the game to give Denmark the lead, but Mario Mandzukic equalised only three minutes later, leaving the teams equally perched at one goal apiece.[36] The match remained at 1–1 after ninety minutes, necessitating thirty minutes of extra-time, which still failed to separate the teams, as Luka Modrić saw his late penalty saved by goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel.[36] As such, the tie was to be decided with a penalty shoot-out, with Schmeichel and his Croatian counterpart, Danijel Subašić, positioning themselves on the line to face five penalties each.[37] Croatia advanced, as Subašić saved three shots from Eriksen, Lasse Schöne and Nicolai Jørgensen respectively. Ivan Rakitić scored the decisive penalty to eliminate the Danes,[37] putting an end to their best World Cup campaign since 2002.[38]\n\n\nFollowing the World Cup, Denmark prepared for participation in the inaugural iteration of the UEFA Nations League, having been drawn in League B against Wales and the Republic of Ireland.[39] The tournament offers an alternative route of qualification for the European Championship,[40] and increases the number of competitive games for international sides, replacing friendlies.[41]\n\n\n\nMain article: 2018 Slovakia v Denmark football match\n\nOwing to a dispute with the players' union regarding the commercial rights of the players,[42] the Danish Football Union named an entirely uncapped squad, consisting of a mixture of futsal players and players from the Danish 2nd Division and the Denmark Series (the third and fourth tier of Danish football respectively), in lieu of the regular side, to face Slovakia in a pre-Nations League friendly, and it was feared that the same squad would be used for the competitive fixture against Wales.[43][44] The dispute arose due to the image rights of the players,[45] with Hummel having the exclusive right to the manufacture and marketing of Danish kits.[46] The DBU wanted to use individual players, without explicit permissions, in their advertising.[47][48] Hareide would similarly not be involved, with the side instead falling under the temporary management of John Jensen, with Hasse Kuhn serving as the assistant manager.[42] The Danish FA are currently under a four-year probationary period with UEFA for having forfeited a Women's World Cup qualification game against Sweden in 2017 due to a similar dispute with the women's team,[49] and a further violation could have resulted in Denmark being prohibited from participation in either the 2018–19 UEFA Nations League or the 2020 European Championship.[50] After a temporary agreement enabled the return of the regular players, the Danes won their first Nations League fixture 2–0.[51]\n\n\nHareide managed Denmark during UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying and won four matches, drawing four more. This meant Denmark qualified for the tournament, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic the tournament was postponed to 2021, and Hareide's contract expired on 30 June 2020. He was replaced by Kasper Hjulmand.\n\n\n\n### Hjulmand era: 2020–present[edit]\n\n\nAt UEFA Euro 2020, Denmark lost their first group stage match against Finland; Eriksen suffered a cardiac arrest in the 43rd minute, causing the match to be halted. They reached the semi-finals despite finishing the group stage with only one win, in which they lost 2–1 in extra-time against England.[52] In the 2022–23 UEFA Nations League A, they finished second in their group, only one point behind Croatia and winning twice against world champions France.[53][54] Denmark also qualified for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, topping Group F in the qualification campaign ahead of Scotland, with nine victories. Only one defeat occurred in the final fixture against the Scots in a game which Denmark were already guaranteed a direct place in Qatar.[55]\n\n\nIn the 2022 World Cup, Denmark were drawn again with old foe France, together with African powerhouse Tunisia and Asian underdogs Australia in group D.[56] Due to their impressive Euro 2020 performance and World Cup qualifying and Nations League displays, expectations for Denmark to make a historic breakthrough were high and the Danes were even seen as the biggest dark horses in the World Cup, with predictions going as far as winning it.[57] Denmark were reinforced with the return of captain Christian Eriksen, who recovered from the Euro 2020 stroke.[58] They began their World Cup quest in Qatar with a goalless draw to Tunisia in a game where the Danes controlled possession.[59] In the second game, Denmark played France in the Nations League rematch. This time Les Bleus prevailed over the Danes 2–1, with a brace from Kylian Mbappé after an equaliser from Andreas Christensen.[60] Denmark were forced to beat Australia, who previously downed Tunisia; however, Denmark demonstrated a rather poor performance against the Aussies, unable to break the deadlock and conceding a goal by Mathew Leckie to lose 1–0.[61] Denmark finished last in their group with only one point and one goal scored.[62][63] Moreover, the elimination by Australia meant Denmark were eliminated by an Asian representative for the second time in its history, having been eliminated by Japan back in 2010.\n\n\n\n## Team image[edit]\n\n\n### Supporters[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Roligan\n\nApart from the national team, Denmark is equally famous for its traveling fans, known as *roligans*. The movement emerged during the 1980s as the declared opposition to hooliganism. The goal of the roligan movement is calm, yet cheerful, support during the matches, as \"*rolig*\" means \"calm\" in the Danish language. The *roligans* have since developed an image of easy-going nature and rabid support, and are often considered amongst the world's best national team fans, along with the Tartan Army of Scotland. They were collectively given the FIFA FairPlay Award at the 1984 European Championships.[64] Just before the 1986 World Cup, the roligan movement was organized in order to support the national team at the tournament.\n\n\nThe reputation of the Danish supporters was sullied by an attack from a fan which occurred in June 2007 in the Euro 2008 qualifying match against Sweden, when an enraged Danish supporter invaded the pitch and tried to attack the referee, following his decision to hand out a red card for Christian Poulsen and a penalty kick to Sweden in the last minute of the match. The attacking fan was stopped by some of the Danish football players on the field before he reached the referee, but due to the episode, the match was immediately cancelled by the referee, with UEFA subsequently deciding to award a 0–3 default defeat to Denmark as punishment.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Rivalry[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Denmark–Sweden football rivalry\n\nDenmark's main rival is Sweden. The countries have played against each other 107 times, of which Denmark have won 40, drawn 20 and lost 47. The first match between the teams was an 8–0 Denmark win in May 1913. Denmark won their first five matches against Sweden before their first defeat in October 1916, 4–0.\n\n\nThe first competitive match between the countries was a 1–0 loss for Denmark in the group stage of UEFA Euro 1992. Both teams advanced from the group stage and Denmark went on to win the tournament. In UEFA Euro 2004 the teams drew 2–2 in the last group match, ensuring that both teams advanced at the expense of Italy. In Denmark's home match against Sweden in the qualification for UEFA Euro 2008, the visitors were awarded a 3–0 win after a Danish fan invaded the pitch and attacked the referee. The reverse fixture ended in a goalless draw and Denmark failed to qualify for the final tournament.\n\n\nIn the qualification for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, Denmark won both matches against Sweden 1–0 and qualified for the World Cup. In the play-off round of the qualification for UEFA Euro 2016, Denmark lost to Sweden 4–3 on aggregate and failed to qualify for the finals. The most recent match between the countries was a 2–0 win for Denmark in November 2020.[65]\n\n\n\n### Kit[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Denmark national football team kits.\n\nThe team kit is produced by Danish company Hummel. It is all-red with white details to reflect the colours of the Danish national flag. Prior to the period of Adidas sponsorship, the kit provider was also Hummel from 1979 to 2004.[66]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Kit provider\n | Period\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![Denmark](image) Hummel | 1979–2004\n |\n| ![Germany](image) Adidas | 2004–2016\n |\n| ![Denmark](image) Hummel\n | 2016–present\n |\n\n\n### Media coverage[edit]\n\n\nDenmark's home and away matches are broadcast by TV2 on television, and DR on the radio.\n\n\n\n## Home stadium[edit]\n\n\nFor stadium history, see Parken Stadium.\n\n![](image)Parken Stadium, with a capacity of 38,065 spectators, located in Copenhagen, and used as official home stadium by the Denmark national football team.\nThe first home match for the Denmark national team was a 2–1 friendly win over England on 25 May 1910, taking place with 12,000 spectators at the stadium \"KBs baner\" (located in the area \"Granen\", where the Forum Copenhagen later was built).[67] As the facilities were considered too small, a new stadium in Copenhagen was built with the name **Idrætsparken**, that since its opening 25 May 1911 hosted all the home matches of the football club KB and most of the home matches of the national team. During the first 82 years of the national team, from October 1908 until November 1990, Denmark played a total number of 254 A-level home matches, of which 232 were played in Idrætsparken. Among all the played home matches in Idrætsparken, Denmark achieved 125 victories (54%), 41 draws (18%) and 66 defeats (28%). The stadium reached a record of 51,600 spectators for the 1–2 game against Sweden in June 1957.[68]\n\n\nIn regards of the first era from 1908 to 1990, only 22 home matches were played at other stadiums than Idrætsparken, of which 11 took place at Aarhus Idrætspark (then known as Atletion) in Aarhus, followed by Aalborg Stadion in Aalborg with six games, and the remaining five matches hosted by four other stadiums. Whenever another stadium than Idrætsparken was used for a home match, it was only for some of the less important friendly games or Olympic qualifiers. While only Idrætsparken was used to host the matches related to big important tournaments, like the Nordic championship, the UEFA European Championship and FIFA World Cup. When a major rebuild of Idrætsparken began in December 1990, the subsequent two official Euro 1992 qualification matches were moved to Odense Stadium in Odense.\n\n\nOn 9 September 1992, the rebuilt Idrætsparken, now called **Parken** and later renamed **Telia Parken** for sponsorship reasons, became the biggest venue in Denmark with a capacity of 42,358 spectators, and was opened with a friendly 1–2 defeat against Germany. This first match in Parken was viewed by 40,500 spectators,[69] while the current stadium record of 42,099 spectators was set on 8 October 2005 for a World Cup qualifying match against Greece.[70]\n\n\nThe capacity of the stadium was later reduced to 38,009 seats after the upper part of the D-side was converted from 4,000 extra seats into office and VIP areas in June 2009.[71][72] Despite this decrease in capacity, the stadium is today still the biggest venue in Denmark by far; the next largest venue, Brøndby Stadium, only has a capacity of 26,000 seats. From September 1992 to May 2006, Parken was the sole stadium of all the men's senior national team matches. However, meagre spectator support at some of the friendly matches at Parken, which from 2000 to 2005 attracted an acceptable average of 23,862 per match – but down to 9,598 for the friendly 3–1 win over Israel in April 2002[73] – prompted the DBU to start hosting many of the friendly matches to other stadiums around Denmark. These other stadiums had less spectator capacity than Parken, but just about enough to cover the Danes' somewhat lesser interest for friendly matches.\n\n\nOn 27 May 2006, Parken's 13-year monopoly on national team matches was broken for the first time when Denmark played a friendly match at the Aarhus Idrætspark against upcoming 2006 World Cup participants Paraguay. Tickets to this match were sold out quickly, with almost 19,000 of the 20,227 tickets sold within the first hour of sale,[74] and was support-wise a big success with a total audience of 20,047 spectators.[75] When the two next friendly matches were played at some other new venues, 16 August at Fionia Park in Odense against Poland, and on 1 September at Brøndby Stadium against Portugal, the number of spectators dropped to a disappointing level. The Poland match attracted only 11,088 spectators,[76] while the Portugal match only 13,186 spectators.[77] In particular, the Portugal match was deemed as a support-wise failure because it featured a higher-ranked opponent, which spectators normally would have a high interest to watch. The main reasons why Brøndby Stadium failed to attract a high number of spectators were generally thought to be a combination of the poor rainy weather and the fact the stadium is located on the outskirts of Copenhagen, and as such does not attract a new demographic audience compared to Parken, due to the travel distances being more or less the same for the majority of the population.\n\n\nCurrently, while most of the friendly matches continue to be played at some of the smaller stadiums in Denmark, it has been decided to continue playing all of the qualifying matches for the European Championships and World Cup only at Parken Stadium.[78] Those friendly matches, which are believed to create a high interest from spectators, will also continue to be played at Parken. For example, the friendly against Germany in August 2010 was played at Parken Stadium due to the high expectation of spectators desiring to watch the match. However, after Denmark's performance at the 2010 World Cup, the friendly only drew 19,071 spectators.[79] From September 1992 to January 2012, Denmark played a total of 77 A-level matches at Parken Stadium, of which 49 were won, 16 were drawn and 12 lost.[80]\n\n\n\n## Results and fixtures[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Denmark national football team results (2020–present)\n\nThe following is a list of match results in the last 12 months, as well as any future matches that have been scheduled.\n\n\n  Win\n  Draw\n  Loss\n  Fixture\n\n\n\n### 2022[edit]\n\n\nDenmark ![](image) v ![](image) Tunisia\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 22 November 2022 2022 FIFA World Cup |  **Denmark ![](image)**  | **0–0** |  **![](image) Tunisia**  | Al Rayyan, Qatar |\n| 16:00 AST |  | Report |  | Stadium: Education City StadiumAttendance: 42,925Referee: César Ramos (Mexico) |\n\nFrance ![](image) v ![](image) Denmark\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 26 November 2022 2022 FIFA World Cup |  **France ![](image)**  | **2–1** |  **![](image) Denmark**  | Doha, Qatar |\n| 19:00 AST | * Mbappé ![](image) 61', 86'\n | Report | * A.

description for the manager of the Denmark national football team, has changed throughout the history. From 1908 to 1918, the DBU preferred to assign a manager with the overall responsibility. This was followed by a long era from 1919 to 1956 where either no manager or only a caretaker manager was assigned. When the DBU assigned Arne Sørensen (November 1956 – December 1961) and Poul Petersen (January 1962 –December 1966) as managers for a rolling period of several years, they were given the responsibility to coach the physical training and decide the team tactics before and during each match, but had no influence upon the selection of players for the national squad, which was a job for the specially-appointed selection committee, the *UdtagelsesKomitéen*.[81]\n\n\nFrom 1967 to 1969, the management of the team more or less became a sole responsibility for the *UdtagelsesKomitéen*, following a new approach. In this new approach, the job to select players continued to be the responsibility for the *UdtagelsesKomitéen*, but the chairman of the committee was now also appointed to be the \"tactical manager\" of the national team, as the DBU realized the need of having a special tactical manager assigned to get influence upon both the selection of players and the related tactics before and during the game. However, the appointed tactical manager did not have the responsibility to train the squad, as a special physical coach was instead selected for that job. In 1970, the approach with two managers assigned was again abandoned when the DBU realized the need to assign only one manager with the sole responsibility for the squad.[81]\n\n\nFrom 1970 to 1979, the job to select players was not yet a sole responsibility of the manager alone, but only a shared responsibility, as this continued to be a matter for the *UdtagelsesKomitéen* to decide. When a selection of players had to be made, it was decided by a vote in the committee, with the appointed manager being granted an influence of three votes and the four members of the committee being granted one vote each. This special selection procedure continued until July 1979, where it was decided to award the sole responsibility of all manager-related areas to the manager himself, with the assignment of Sepp Piontek as the first full-time professional manager of the national team.[81]\n\n\n\n#### Manager history[edit]\n\n\nA complete overview of every national team manager since the first official game in October 1908.

They are normally assembled from their respective club teams at the Hotel Marienlyst in Elsinore for a week-long training camp preluding the upcoming match. Friendly matches are typically played on a Wednesday evening. World Cup qualifiers are played on both Saturday and Wednesday evenings, while Euro qualifiers now take place on both a Friday and Tuesday evening when playing two matches in a row, or on a Friday/Saturday/Tuesday at rounds with only one match scheduled.[86][87]\n\n\n\n### Best players of all time[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2006, the DBU nominated eight Danish national team footballers for the \"Best Danish Footballer of All Time\" award. The nominated players were Morten Olsen, Henning Jensen, Allan Simonsen, Preben Elkjær, Michael Laudrup, Brian Laudrup, Peter Schmeichel and Jon Dahl Tomasson. The winner of the award was decided by a public vote arranged by the broadcasting channel TV2, which ended with Michael Laudrup as a clear winner, with 58% of the votes.[88]\n\n\n\n### Hall of Fame[edit]\n\n\nDenmark's Hall of Fame was established in October 2008, as a special award to celebrate the best footballers, teams and coaches; throughout the history of the national team. A jury with 6 people (representing the newspapers, authors of football books, active players of the national team, TV2, the DBU, and a Hall of Fame member), each year have the job to award one or two new members for the Hall of Fame. The award will be handed out at the official Danish Football Awards, which is a yearly television broadcast event – organized by the DBU in November throughout 2008 to 2013 and subsequently moved to a later date in February. Beside of receiving the award, all Hall of Fame members are also invited to leave a footprint in bronze, to decorate the entrance hall at \"Fodboldens hus\" -the DBU headquarters in Brøndby.[89] When the DBU celebrated its 125-year anniversary in May 2014, it decided to make an extraordinary award of nine additional Hall of Fame Members, all playing during the first half of the DBU national team's existence, from 1908 to 1964.[90] Because of financial restraints, the DBU cancelled the planned televised broadcast of the Football Award in February 2015, and for the same reason opted not to award any new Hall of Fame members in this specific year. The DBU expected to return awarding new Hall of Fame members again, when the next broadcast Football Award event is organized in February 2016.[91]\n\n\n\n#### Hall of Fame members[edit]\n\n\nSorted by last year appearing at the national football team.\n\n\n\n1. **Sophus Krølben Nielsen** (1908–1919)[90]\n2. **Nils Middelboe** (1908–1920)[90]\n3. **Sophus Målmand Hansen** (1911–1920)[90]\n4. **Carl Skomar Hansen** (1918–1921)[90]\n5. **Poul \"Tist\" Nielsen** (1910–1925)[90]\n6. **Pauli Jørgensen** (1925–1939)[90]\n7. **Carl Aage Præst** (1945–1949)[92]\n8. **Eigil Nielsen** (1940–1951)[90]\n9. **Knud Lundberg** (1943–1956)[90]\n10. **Aage Rou Jensen** (1945–1957)[93]\n11. **Harald Nielsen** (1959–1960)[94]\n12. **Henry From** (1957–1961)[93]\n13. **Poul Pedersen** (1953–1964)[90]\n14. **Henning Enoksen** (1958–1966)[95]\n15. **Per Røntved** (1970–1982)[96]\n16. **Allan Simonsen** (1972–1986)[92]\n17. **Frank Arnesen** (1977–1987)[97]\n18. **Preben Elkjær** (1977–1988)[98]\n19. **Søren Lerby** (1978–1989)[97]\n20. **Danish Dynamite team** (1980–1989)[a]\n21. **Sepp Piontek** (coach, 1979–1990)[99]\n22. **Euro 1992 team** (June 1992)[b]\n23. **Lars Høgh** (1983–1995)[100]\n24. **Richard Møller Nielsen** (coach, 1990–1996)[101]\n25. **Michael Laudrup** (1982–1998)[89]\n26. **Brian Laudrup** (1987–1998)[102]\n27. **Peter Schmeichel** (1987–2001)[103]\n28. **Morten Olsen** (1970–1989, coach 2000–2015)[104]\n\n### Payment[edit]\n\n\nEach national team player receives a set amount of money per match, including bonuses for a win and qualification for European Championship and World Cup tournaments. Throughout the years, the prize money has gone from around €1,340 for a match win in 1987 and around €26,800 for the Euro 1988 participation alone, to around €67,000 for the 1998 World Cup, and up to €107,000 for the 2002 World Cup participations, per player.[105]\n\n\nCurrently, the payments for participation in games outside the big tournaments are regulated by a collective agreement – to be renegotiated after a certain number of years – while all payments for participation of players in a final tournament squad are regulated by the \"1998 agreement\" between the DBU and *Spillerforeningen*. The \"1998 agreement\" stipulates that whenever the national team qualifies for a World Cup or European Championship tournament, the selected players for the final tournament shall receive 50% of the DBU's revenues from the event, and 65% of the DBU's revenues from the sale of merchandise and license agreements. Additionally, the sponsors of the national team also pay a relatively high \"qualification bonus\" each time the team qualifies for a final tournament. This bonus is shared between the group of players being selected for the final 18-man squad, to one or several of the qualification matches played, with the exact distribution normally decided according to the number of times the player was selected.[106]\n\n\nEach of the 23 selected players for the 2002 World Cup received DKK 498,000 (equal to €66,800) from the event revenues,[106] plus DKK 122,900 (equal to €16,500) from the sale of merchandise and license agreements, plus an unknown qualification bonus from the sponsors, plus the standard payment from the DBU each time they were selected for the final 18-man squad to a qualification match.[107] In comparison, each of the 23 selected players for the 2010 World Cup received DKK 635,000 (equal to €85,100) from the event revenues, plus DKK 98,900 (equal to €13,200) from the sale of merchandise and license agreements, plus a qualification bonus from the sponsors at DKK 2,800,000 (equal to €375,000) to be shared between the players – corresponding to an amount of €2,080 per time the player was selected for the final 18-man squad to a qualification match. In addition to the qualification bonus, the players also received this standard payment from the DBU each time they were selected for the 18-man squad to a qualification match:[107]\n\n\n\n* **Starting fee:** home games = DKK 1,2 per spectator, away games = DKK 8,290\n* **Bonus for a draw:** home games = DKK 0, away games = DKK 9,475\n* **Bonus for a win:** home games = DKK 17,765, away games = DKK 29,600\n\n\nBased on Denmark's results and number of spectators at home matches,[20] the standard qualification match payment to a player selected for all Denmark's qualification matches equals a total amount of DKK 235,898 (or €31,600) for the six qualification matches in the 2008–09 season, and a total amount of DKK 170,788 (or €22,900) for the four qualification matches in the 2009–10 season. Finally, the players could also add a seasonal payment named \"regular bonus\" from the sponsors, with a total of DKK 4,350,000 (equal to €583,100) to be shared each season by the squad of 18 players selected for a match, meaning a player who was selected for all national team matches from 1 August to 31 July would receive an additional DKK 241,700 (equal to €32,400) payment in both the 2008–09 and 2009–10 seasons.[107]\n\n\nThe last amount of a players income generated by the national team is the standard payment received for each friendly match:[108]\n\n\n\n* **Starting fee:** home games = DKK 1,0 per spectator, away games = DKK 5,000\n* **Bonus for a draw:** home games = DKK 0, away games = DKK 0\n* **Bonus for a win:** home games = DKK 10,000, away games = DKK 10,000\n\n\nBased on Denmark's results and number of spectators at home matches,[20] the standard payment to a player selected for all Denmark's friendly matches equals a total amount of DKK 41,426 (or €5,500) for the three friendly matches in the 2008–09 season, and a total amount of DKK 88,773 (or €11,900) for the seven friendly matches in the 2009–10 season.\n\n\nWhen all these payments are added together for a player, under the assumption a player was selected for all matches in each season as well as the final 2010 World Cup squad, he would have received a total payment from the DBU of €69,500 in the 2008–09 season and a total payment from the DBU of €186,300 in the 2009–10 season.\n\n\n\n## Player records[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Denmark national football team records and statistics\n\n*As of 17

Copenhagen (1992–present) |\n\n\n**Parken Stadium**, also known simply as **Parken** and as Telia Parken (2014–2020),[2] is a football stadium in the Indre Østerbro (*Inner Østerbro*) district of Copenhagen, Denmark, built from 1990 to 1992. The stadium, which features a retractable roof, currently has a capacity of 38,065 for football games, and is the home of FC Copenhagen and the Denmark national football team. The capacity for concerts exceeds the capacity for matches – the stadium can hold as many as 50,000 people with an end-stage setup and 55,000 with a centre-stage setup.\n\n\nParken was announced as one of 12 host venues of the UEFA Euro 2020 and it hosted three group stage matches, as well as a round of 16 match.[3]\n\n\nGeranium, a three Michelin star restaurant, is located on the eighth floor of the stadium.[4]\n\n\nOn 10 November 2021, the stadium entered into a long-term partnership with the telecommunications company 3. Parken will continue to be called Parken, while the stadium partnership is entitled \"Parken - Connected by 3.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Parken field in August 2011\nParken was built on the site of former Denmark national stadium, Idrætsparken, from 1990 to 1992. The last national team match in Idrætsparken was a 0–2 Euro 1992 qualification loss to Yugoslavia on 14 November 1990, and on 9 September 1992, Parken was opened with a 1–2 defeat in a friendly game against Germany.\n\n\nThe stadium was rebuilt by investors Baltica Finans A/S in turn of the guarantee from the Danish Football Association, that all national matches would be played at Parken for 15 years. The re-construction, tore down and re-built three of the original four stands, cost 640 million Danish kroner.\n\n\nIn 1998, Baltica Finans sold the stadium to F.C. Copenhagen for 138 million DKK, and the club now owns both the stadium and the adjacent office buildings in the company of Parken Sport & Entertainment.\n\n\nParken was included in UEFA's list of 4-star stadiums in the autumn of 1993, making Parken eligible for hosting the finals of the Europa League (then named UEFA Cup) as well as the now defunct Cup Winners' Cup. Being a 4-star stadium, Parken can not apply for the biggest European club game, the UEFA Champions League final, as that demands 50,000 seats.\n\n\nOn 2 June 2007, Parken was the venue for the UEFA Euro 2008 qualifier fan attack.\n\n\nOn 1 May 2014 a new stadium covering Wi-Fi solution, powered by Telia was published. The deal provides free high speed Wi-Fi for all spectators at any event at the stadium.[6] The agreement includes a 7 year long naming sponsorship, and on 17 July 2014, the stadium name was changed to Telia Parken.[7]\n\n\nOn 26 August 2020, it was announced that the stadiums name would be reverted to the original name, Parken, five days later on 31 August.\n\n\n\n## Notable matches[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Date\n | Team #1\n | Result\n | Team #2\n | Competition\n | Attendance\n | Remarks\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 9 September 1992 | ![](image) Denmark | 1–2 | ![](image) Germany | Friendly match | 40,500 | Opening match\n |\n| 4 May 1994 | ![England](image) Arsenal | 1–0 | ![Italy](image) Parma | 1994 European Cup Winners' Cup Final | 33,765 |  |\n| 17 May 2000 | ![Turkey](image) Galatasaray | 0–0(4–1 p) | ![England](image) Arsenal | 2000 UEFA Cup Final | 38,919 |  |\n| 8 October 2005 | ![](image) Denmark | 1–0 | ![](image) Greece | 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifying Group 2 | 42,099 | Stadium attendance record\n |\n| 6 April 2006 | ![Denmark](image) F.C.

As a direct consequence of this, and to make Parken a more useful venue in general, a retractable roof was applied to the existing structure in 2000 and 2001.\n\n\nMusicians such as AC/DC, Beyoncé, Justin Bieber, The Black Eyed Peas, Bon Jovi, David Bowie, Eric Clapton, Coldplay, Depeche Mode, Celine Dion, Guns N' Roses, Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, Jay-Z, Elton John, Kashmir, Lady Gaga, Madonna, Paul McCartney, Metallica, Mew, George Michael, Muse, One Direction, Pet Shop Boys, Pharrell, Pink, Pink Floyd, Red Hot Chili Peppers, R.E.M., The Rolling Stones, Britney Spears, Bruce Springsteen, Take That, Tiësto, Tina Turner, U2, Roger Waters, and Robbie Williams have performed at Parken. In 2017, Volbeat became the first Danish band to sell out the venue; their *Let's Boogie* DVD is of this concert.\n\n\nThe biggest concert ever held in Parken was a performance by Michael Jackson on 14 August 1997, during his *HIStory* tour, with 60,000 tickets sold; a second show was held on the 29th, in which Jackson was thrown a surprise birthday party after the performance of \"You Are Not Alone\".\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Association football portal\n* ![flag](image)Denmark portal\n\n\n* Speedway Grand Prix of Denmark\n* List of football stadiums in Denmark\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** https://www.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Download/FirstDiv/uefaorg/Publications/01/67/03/93/1670393\\_DOWNLOAD.pdf [*bare URL PDF*]\n2. **^** [1], fck.dk\n3. **^** Wembley to stage UEFA EURO 2020 final, UEFA.com\n4. **^** Geranium (The World's 50 Best Restaurants)\n5. **^** \"PARKEN AND 3 ENTER INTO STADIUM SPONSORSHIP AGREEMENT\".

Its seating capacity of 80,698 makes it the largest stadium in France. The stadium is used by the French national football and rugby union teams for international competitions. It is the largest in Europe for track and field events, seating 78,338 in that configuration. During other events, the stadium's running track is mostly hidden under the football pitch. \n\n\nOriginally built for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, the stadium's name was recommended by Michel Platini, head of the organising committee. On 12 July 1998, France beat Brazil 3–0 in the 1998 FIFA World Cup Final contested at the stadium. It will host the athletics events at the 2024 Summer Olympics. It will also host matches for the 2023 Rugby World Cup. After the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the 2022 UEFA Champions League Final was moved from the Gazprom Arena to the Stade de France. \n\n\nThe Stade de France, listed as a Category 4 stadium by UEFA, hosted matches at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, the UEFA Champions League finals in 2000, 2006 and 2022. As well as the 1999 and 2007 Rugby World Cup, making it one of only two stadia in the world to have hosted both a Football World Cup final and a rugby union World Cup final (along with Nissan Stadium in Yokohama). It also hosted seven matches at UEFA Euro 2016, including the final, where France lost to Portugal 1–0 after extra-time. The facility also hosted the Race of Champions auto race in 2004, 2005, and 2006. The stadium hosted the 2003 World Championships in Athletics and from 1999 to 2016 it hosted the annual Meeting Areva athletics meet.\n\n\nDomestically, the Stade de France serves as a secondary home facility of Parisian rugby clubs Stade Français and Racing 92, hosting a few of their regular-season fixtures. The stadium also hosts the main French domestic cup finals, which include the Coupe de France (both football and rugby), Coupe de la Ligue, Challenge de France, and the Coupe Gambardella, as well as the Top 14 rugby union championship match.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Stade de France visible from central Paris behind the basilica of Sacré-Cœur.\nThe discussion of a national stadium in France came about as a result of the country's selection to host the 1998 FIFA World Cup on 2 July 1992.[*citation needed*] As a result of the selection, the country and the French Football Federation made a commitment to construct an 80,000+ capacity all-seater stadium with every seat in the facility being covered. It was the first time in over 70 years since the construction of the Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir that a stadium in France was being constructed for a specific event. Due to the magnitude and importance of the facility, the Council of State was allowed first hand approach to how the stadium would be constructed and paid for. The Council sought for the stadium to be built as close as possible to the capital of France, Paris, and that the constructor and operator of the facility would receive significant financial contribution for a period of 30 months following the completion of the stadium. The stadium's design was handled by the team of architects composed of Michel Macary, Aymeric Zublena, Michel Regembal, and Claude Constantini who were associated with CR SCAU Architecture.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe stadium was officially ready for construction following the government's selection of manufacturers, Bouygues, Dumez, and SGE, and the signing of building permits on 30 April 1995.[3][4] With only 31 months to complete the stadium, construction commenced on 2 May 1995. The laying of the first cornerstone took place five months later on 6 September. After over a year of construction, over 800,000 m² of earthworks had been created and as much as 180,000 m³ of concrete had been poured. The installation of the roof, which cost €45 million, and the mobile platform also took more than a year to complete.\n\n\nDuring the developmental phase, the stadium was referred to in French as the *Grand Stade* (\"large stadium\" or \"great stadium\"). On 4 December 1995, the Ministry of Sport launched a design competition to decide on a name for the stadium. The stadium was officially named the Stade de France after the Ministry heard a proposal from French football legend Michel Platini, who recommended the name. The total cost of the stadium was €364 million.[5][6]\n\n\nThe stadium was inaugurated on 28 January 1998 as it hosted a football match between France and Spain. The match was played in front of 78,368 spectators, which included President Jacques Chirac, with France winning the match 1–0 with Zinedine Zidane scoring the lone goal, and the first-ever in the Stade de France, in the 20th minute.[7] Six months later, France returned to the stadium and defeated Brazil in the 1998 FIFA World Cup Final to earn their first World Cup title. Stade de France has hosted group, quarter-final, semi-final and the final match of 1998 FIFA World Cup.[8] The national rugby team's first match in the facility was contested five days after its opening, on 2 February, with France earning a 24–17 win over England in front of 77,567 spectators.[9] Philippe Bernat-Salles converted the first ever try at the stadium scoring it in the 11th minute of play.[10]\n\n\nOn 24 May 2000, the Stade de France hosted the 2000 UEFA Champions League Final. In the match, which saw 78,759 spectators attend, Spanish club Real Madrid defeated fellow Spanish club Valencia 3–0. In 2003, the Stade de France was the primary site of the 2003 World Championships in Athletics. Three years later, the facility hosted another UEFA Champions League final with another Spanish club Barcelona defeating England's Arsenal 2–1. On 9 May 2009, the Stade de France set the national attendance record for a sporting match played in France with 80,832 showing up to watch Guingamp upset Brittany rivals Rennes 2–1 in the 2009 Coupe de France Final. On 22 May 2010, the Stade de France hosted the 2010 Heineken Cup Final.[11] On 11 February 2012, a Six Nations international rugby game between France and Ireland had to be cancelled just before kick-off due to the pitch freezing as the stadium lacks under-soil heating.[12]\n\n\nOn 13 November 2015, in one of a series of coordinated shootings and bombings across Paris, the Stade de France was targeted. Two explosions occurred outside the stadium during an international friendly between France and Germany, with French President François Hollande in attendance. The terrorist, however, was unable to enter the stadium.[13] The explosion was heard inside the stadium, and many thought it was a firework going off inside the stadium. The attacker wanted to infiltrate the stadium, but was scared away when he saw security and was forced to detonate outside the park. The authorities, aware of what had occurred outside the stadium, chose to continue the match out of concerns that cancelling it would have caused a panic. The stadium has since improved its counter-attack training and strengthened its security.[14] There have since been new guidelines issued by the French police, with mixed reactions.[15]\n\n\n\n![](image)The opening ceremony of the 2016 European Football Championship\nIn 2016, the Stade de France was used as the central stadium for the 2016 Euros hosting seven matches.[16] The stadium was used for the opening ceremony of the tournament which saw French DJ David Guetta perform at the stadium. At the end of his set, Guetta invited Swedish singer Zara Larsson on stage to perform the tournament's official song \"This One's for You\".[17][18] Following the ceremony the stadium was used for the tournament's opening game which saw France beat Romania 2–1.[19] Across the next month, the stadium was used for six other tournament matches including the UEFA Euro 2016 Final between France and Portugal. The match followed the closing ceremony which again saw David Guetta perform.[20] Portugal defeated France, 1–0 in extra time, winning the tournament for the first time.[21]\n\n\nThe 2022 UEFA Champions League Final, between Liverpool F.C. and Real Madrid CF, was delayed because of difficulties admitting fans, some of them having bogus tickets. Gérald Darmanin, the French interior minister, blamed only Liverpool fans for the delay and difficulties, claiming that Liverpool fans were out of control and trying to enter the stadium.[22] French police used tear gas and pepper spray to try to break up crowds. Several cases of aggressions and robberies of fans attempting to leave the stadium occurred.[23] Several supporters, journalists, and political figures have disputed French authorities' claims.\n\n\n\n## Architecture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Stade de France with uncovered athletics track during the 2003 World Championships\nThe Stade de France has a movable stand which can be retracted to uncover part of the athletics track.[24] The stadium was notably designed with the assistance of a software simulation of crowd in order to get an accurate observation of how it would look fully developed. The facility was also intended to draw interest in and develop the area of the Plaine Saint-Denis, which straddle the communes of Saint-Denis, Aubervilliers, and Saint-Ouen. The primary goal was to renovate the area by building new residential and tertiary sites.\n\n\nThe stadium was built without any undersoil heating as noted when Ireland were due to play France in the Six Nations Tournament rugby union match of 2012, in which the game had to be canceled.\n\n\nIn 2002, the International Association for Bridge and Structural Engineering (IABSE) awarded a prize recognizing the unique structure of the Stade de France commenting that the Stade de France exhibited \"a construction of an attractive open architecture of the city, with an elegance and natural lightness\".\n\n\n\n### Roof[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The last part of the metallic construction of the roof, 1997\nConstruction of the Stade de France's roof cost over €45 million. Its elliptical shape symbolizes the universality of sport in France. Its area of six hectares and weight, 13,000 tons, is considered a technical marvel by many. It was designed to easily protect the 80,000 spectators without covering the playing field. All lighting and sound, which include 550 lights and 36 blocks of 5 speakers, are housed inside to avoid obstructing visibility. The tinted glass in the center reduces the contrast and distributes natural light. It filters out red and infrared radiation, however, it allows blue and green lights, due to their necessity involving the health of the turf.\n\n\n\n## Interior[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Visitors' changing room\n### Stands[edit]\n\n\nThe Stade de France is the biggest modular stadium in the world with three galleries.\n\n\nThe forum is a low mobile platform of 25,000 seats. It is reached by level 1. It may fall 15 feet to reveal all of the running track and jumping pits. It then retains 22,000 seats. The movement lasts 80 hours, 40 people 20h/24h mobilized, and carried by ten distinct elements of 700 tons each.\n\n\nAccess to the gallery is through with 22 bridges and can be found at level 3 with a concentration of restaurants, entertainment areas, shops and central station security.\n\n\n18 staircases lead viewers to the upper gallery located at Level 6.\n\n\nThe evacuation of 80,000 spectators on the porch out can occur in less than 15 minutes.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Field[edit]\n\n\nLocated at 11 meters below the court, the playing area measures 9,000 square meters (120 meters long and 75 meters wide) to a grassed area of 11,000 square meters. Nearly one billion seeds were sown to produce the first pitch in 1997. Today, the grass comes in rolls of 1.20 m x 8 m. Changing the pitch calls for three days of preparation and five days of installation. The change takes place several times a year, depending on the programming stage.\nUnlike many other stadiums, the Stade de France was built without under pitch heating, as the stadium was constructed on the site of an old gasworks,[25] and there were concerns[*by whom?*] it could cause an explosion.\n\n\n\n### Giant screens[edit]\n\n\nAs part of its policy of renewing its infrastructure, the Stade de France added two new big screens in September 2006. The new displays have a surface 58% greater than the previous screens installed in 1998. The newer giant screens are each composed of 4,423,680 light emitting diodes. They have faster response time and are brighter than the previous screens.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Major sports matches[edit]\n\n\nSporting events held at the Stade de France include matches (preliminary contests as well as finals) of the 1998 FIFA World Cup, 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup, 2007 Rugby World Cup and UEFA Euro 2016. The 2023 Rugby World Cup, including the final, and the MLB World Tour in 2025 is also planned for the venue. It also hosted the 2022 UEFA Champions League Final after being moved from the Gazprom Arena in Russia due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[26]\n\n\n\n## Concerts[edit]\n\n\nThe stadium is also used for music concerts. Global acts such as The Rolling Stones, Beyoncé, Coldplay, Depeche Mode, Muse, Metallica, Prince, U2, Mylène Farmer, Guns N' Roses, Rihanna, AC/DC, Justin Timberlake, Céline Dion, Bruno Mars, The Black Eyed Peas, Tina Turner, Jay Z, Red Hot Chili Peppers, One Direction, Eminem, Lady Gaga, Paul McCartney, Madonna, The Police, BTS and Blackpink have performed here.

Repeated attempts to persuade a professional football or rugby team to move there have failed so far. Upon the construction of the stadium, Paris Saint-Germain declined to move there, choosing to remain at the Parc des Princes under pressure from its then-owner (pay-TV network Canal Plus) and the Paris city government.\n\n\nHowever, the Paris rugby club Stade Français have now established themselves as a semi-regular tenant. They began by scheduling their Top 14 home fixture on 15 October 2005 against Toulouse at Stade de France. Stade Français's president, Max Guazzini, publicly said that the club would have to sell 25,000 to 30,000 tickets to break even. Three weeks before the match, 61,000 tickets had been sold, setting a French record for tickets sold to a league match for any sport, including football. The final attendance was 79,454, smashing the national attendance record for a league match in any sport by more than 20,000. Five minutes before the end of the Toulouse match, Guazzini announced to the crowd that Stade Français's scheduled home fixture against Biarritz in March 2006 would also be held at Stade de France.[42] The Stade-Biarritz match broke the attendance record from earlier in the season, with 79,604 present.\n\n\nGuazzini then booked the Stade de France for the same two league fixtures in 2006–07. The Biarritz match on 16 October 2006 drew 79,619, making this the third consecutive Stade Français fixture at the Stade de France to set an all-time French attendance record. The record was broken yet again at a match against Toulouse on 27 January 2007, with 79,741 filling the stands. Stade Français went on to schedule three home matches at Stade de France in the 2007–08 season. For the 2008–09 season, they booked Stade de France for three home league matches and a Heineken Cup pool match. The number of Stade Français home matches at Stade de France increased again for 2009–10, with five Top 14 fixtures already announced for the stadium.\n\n\nEven with the lack of a regular league tenant, the stadium's revenue increased greatly in 2007, as it was used extensively during the 2007 Rugby World Cup in France, where it hosted numerous pool matches, a quarterfinal match, both of the semi-finals and the final.\n\n\nThe Lille OSC football team played all its \"home\" games in European competition during the 2005–06 season, both in the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Cup, at the Stade de France because its own stadium was then under renovation, and the only nearer alternative on French soil, Stade Félix-Bollaert, was not available as that ground's occupant, Lille's local rival Lens, was also participating in the UEFA Cup. The Stade de France has hosted the Champions League final on three occasions: 2000 (Real Madrid 3 Valencia 0), 2006 (Barcelona 2 Arsenal 1), and 2022 (Real Madrid 1 Liverpool 0),\n\n\n\n### Future developments[edit]\n\n\nFrance's governing body for rugby union, the French Rugby Federation (FFR), announced in November 2010 that it would not renew its deal to use Stade de France for international rugby matches when it expires in 2013. FFR also stated that it planned to build a new stadium of its own in the Paris region.[43]\n\n\nReportedly, the FFR had become increasingly frustrated with several aspects of the deal. According to rugby journalist Ian Moriarty, \"The deal with the Stade de France has been a disaster for the FFR financially over the years, forcing France's powerbrokers to look across the English channel at the RFU's Twickenham cash cow with ever increasing envy.\"[44] Reports vary widely as to how much the FFR must spend to rent out the stadium, but estimates range from €3 million[44] to €5 million[45] per match. Although the Stade de France and Twickenham are roughly the same size, the rental expense means that the FFR reportedly makes about one-third as much from a Stade de France sellout as does the RFU from a sellout at Twickenham.[45] In addition, the national rugby team does not enjoy primacy at the Stade de France; the national football team and major concerts take priority. FFR had to move two of its 2010–11 home Tests to Montpellier and Nantes due to fixture clashes with the national football team.[44] Also, former FFR president Serge Blanco claimed that the 2009 Top 14 final had to be moved from May to June because of a conflict with a Johnny Hallyday rock concert.[43]\n\n\nIn June 2012, FFR announced that it had selected the site for its new ground, tentatively known as Grand Stade FFR.[46] The 82,000-seat stadium, featuring a retractable roof and slide-out pitch, was to be built on a former horse racing track in Évry, about 25 km (16 mi) south of Paris. The new stadium, estimated to cost €600 million, was originally scheduled to open in 2017,[44] but completion was later pushed back to the 2021/2022 time frame.[47] FFR officially abandoned the stadium project in December 2016.[48]\n\n\n\n## Access[edit]\n\n\nAlthough located at the crossroads of auto-routes A1 and A86, it is not advisable to go there by car unless one has reserved parking. The stadium was built with a very limited number of parking spaces, which is why public transportation is considered the primary means of getting to the stadium. River shuttles are provided by the Canal Saint-Denis.\n\n\nAs part of the Grand Paris Express project and 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games, a new station at Saint-Denis Pleyel is under construction, connected by a bridge to the Stade de France–Saint-Denis station. Initially served by Line 14 in time for the Games, the station will eventually serve 4 different Métro lines.[49][50]\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic transport stations serving Stade de France\n| Station\n | Line\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| La Plaine – Stade de France | RER B |\n| Stade de France – Saint-Denis | RER D |\n| Saint-Denis – Porte de Paris | Paris Métro Line 13 and Tramway Line 8 |\n| La Plaine – Stade de France\n | RATP 139, 153, 173, 239, 253\n |\n| Saint-Denis – Porte de Paris | RATP 153, 154, 168, 170, 239, 253, 254, 255, 256, 268\n |\n| Delaunay-Rimet\n | RATP 239, 253\n |\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"Zublena Macary Architects\". *e-Architect*. 3 March 2010.
