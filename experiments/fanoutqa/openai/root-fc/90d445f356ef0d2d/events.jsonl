Other main characters include Dahmer's father Lionel (Richard Jenkins), his stepmother Shari (Molly Ringwald), suspicious neighbor Glenda (Niecy Nash), and grandmother Catherine (Michael Learned).\n\n\n*Dahmer* received mixed reviews, but was ultimately a commercial success, reaching the number-one spot on Netflix in the first week of its release. It became Netflix's second most-watched English-language series of all time within 28 days,[4] and the third Netflix series to pass 1 billion views in 60 days.[5] The series reached number one on the Nielsen Top 10 streaming chart in the first week of its release, and placed No. 7 on Nielsen's all-time list for single-week viewership in its second week.\n\n\nThe series received four nominations at the 80th Golden Globe Awards, including for the Best Limited or Anthology Series or Television Film, with Peters winning for Best Actor – Miniseries or Television Film.

His murders were executed in Bath Township, Ohio, West Allis, Wisconsin, and Milwaukee, Wisconsin between 1978 and 1991. The series dramatizes instances where Dahmer was nearly apprehended until his ultimate conviction and death. It also explores how police incompetence and apathy contributed to enabling his crimes.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n### Main[edit]\n\n\n* Evan Peters as Jeffrey Dahmer, the titular serial killer[6][7][8]\n\t+ Nick A.

Dahmer courts his next potential victim, Tracy Edwards, in a bar and takes him home, but Tracy manages to escape and flag down police. Dahmer is arrested and gruesome discoveries are made in his apartment.\n |\n| 2 | 2 | \"Please Don't Go\" | Clement Virgo | Ryan Murphy & Ian Brennan | September 21, 2022 (2022-09-21) |\n| Dahmer's life as a pre-teen and adolescent, living with Joyce, a drug-addicted mother and Lionel, an oft-absentee father, is explored. The youngster starts to exhibit great interest in dissecting dead animals, with encouragement from his father. In 1991, an adult Dahmer buys alcohol for 14-year old Konerak Sinthasomphone and brings him to his apartment under the guise of paying the teen for lewd photographs. Dahmer drugs the teen, then experiments by using a power drill to drill into the boy's skull. While Dahmer goes out to buy more alcohol, a woozy Konerak awakes and tries to escape but only makes it to the stairwell where Glenda and her daughter find him. Glenda is concerned about the boy's age, and calls police, but the police take Dahmer's word that the boy is an adult who is Dahmer's boyfriend and simply drank too much. The police escort Konerak back inside, and Dahmer kills him after they leave. A real 1991 recording between Glenda and one of the Milwaukee police officers (discussing Konerak) is played over the ending credits.\n |\n| 3 | 3 | \"Doin' A Dahmer\" | Clement Virgo | Ryan Murphy & Ian Brennan | September 21, 2022 (2022-09-21) |\n| As a high school senior in 1977–78, Dahmer continues to show interest in animal dissection while also becoming fully aware of his sexual preference for men. After his father and mother divorce, Lionel moves in with his new girlfriend Shari and soon after Joyce moves away with Jeffrey's younger brother David. Jeffrey is left alone in the house to fend for himself. He begins drinking heavily, lifting weights, and fantasizing about having a male companion in the house. He later picks up a hitchhiker named Steven Hicks and invites him to drink beer and work out. When Steven rejects Dahmer's sexual advance and uses a gay slur, Dahmer hits him with a barbell and then strangles him to death. Two police officers stop him when they see his car swerving, but let him off with a warning despite seeing several garbage bags in the car's back seat. Dahmer destroys Hicks' bones and scatters the ashes on the family property.\n |\n| 4 | 4 | \"The Good Boy Box\" | Jennifer Lynch | Ryan Murphy & Ian Brennan | September 21, 2022 (2022-09-21) |\n| Lionel and Shari return to the Dahmer residence after three months, surprised to hear Joyce moved out, and discovers Jeff's drinking. Jeff attempts to talk to his father about his homicidal thoughts, but is interrupted by Lionel planning to send him to Ohio State University. At OSU, Dahmer is expelled for attendance issues, causing his father to enlist him in the Army in another attempt to get his son's life on track. In 1981, Dahmer is honorably discharged due to alcohol abuse. Lionel sends him to live with his grandmother, Catherine. At her suggestion, Dahmer goes to a state fair, where he gets drunk and is arrested for indecent exposure. He takes a job as a phlebotomist, where he steals blood bags and drinks from them. Dahmer later begins going to a gay bathhouse, but is soon banned for spiking drinks. In 1987, Dahmer accidentally drugs himself in a hotel room with another man, then wakes up the next morning to discover he had murdered him. He takes the body back to Catherine's house to dismember it in the basement. He seals the man's head in a bag and places it in a lock box Catherine gave him.\n |\n| 5 | 5 | \"Blood On Their Hands\" | Jennifer Lynch | Ian Brennan | September 21, 2022 (2022-09-21) |\n| In 1987, Dahmer takes a job at a chocolate factory. He begins to seek out victims with the conscious intention of killing, beginning a cycle of bringing men to Catherine's house, drugging them, strangling them to death, and dismembering them in the cellar. The smells coming from the cellar prompt a confrontation with Catherine and Lionel. When Dahmer tells them that it is caused by his taxidermy hobby, Lionel excoriates him for not cleaning up after it adequately, leading Dahmer to reassure them that he will cease that activity. Dahmer invites Ronald Flowers Jr., a man struggling with his car, to Catherine's house in an attempt to drug and kill him. After Flowers falls unconscious in her living room, Catherine finds him and forces Jeffrey to put him on a bus. After Flowers reports this to the police, they question Dahmer and Catherine, but find no evidence to arrest him. Dahmer is later arrested after another victim, Somsack Sinthasomphone, Konerak's older brother, escapes from him. Dahmer is found guilty of sexual assault and sent to prison. Lionel writes a letter to the judge, asking him to put Jeffrey in a treatment program for alcohol abuse, but the letter is ignored and he is released from custody a year later.\n |\n| 6 | 6 | \"Silenced\" | Paris Barclay | David McMillan & Janet Mock | September 21, 2022 (2022-09-21) |\n| In 1991, Tony Hughes makes a life for himself despite his deafness. He lands a job in Madison, but returns to spend time with his family in Milwaukee on weekends. One weekend evening, he dances at a bar and catches Dahmer's eye. Dahmer thinks about spiking Tony's drink at the bar, but reconsiders. Tony and Dahmer say they like each other, and they meet again the following weekend. Dahmer invites Tony into his apartment, where he again considers drugging him but resists. The two sleep together, and the following morning Tony says he has to leave for work. Dahmer gets a hammer, but lets Tony go. However, when Tony returns for his keys, Dahmer kills him with the hammer. Tony's mother, Shirley contacts police when her son has not checked in and missed work. They seemingly do nothing, so she posts \"Missing Person\" signs all over Milwaukee. As she does, she notices many other such signs near the gay bars. After killing Tony, Dahmer prepares a piece of meat, likely human flesh, cooks it and eats it.\n |\n| 7 | 7 | \"Cassandra\" | Jennifer Lynch | Ian Brennan & Janet Mock & David McMillan | September 21, 2022 (2022-09-21) |\n| After Dahmer is arrested and news of his victims becomes public, there is widespread outrage with police among the victims' families, and particularly with Glenda Cleveland. She is most upset over the murder of Konerak (whom she tried to help before police returned him to Dahmer's apartment) and has been severely traumatized by listening to the noises (screams and power tools) coming from Dahmer's apartment. Dahmer's building is considered hazardous due to the chemicals he used to dissolve body parts. The tenants are evacuated, forcing Glenda to get a motel room. Jesse Jackson takes an interest in the case due to the large number of black and brown victims, and he meets with Glenda, who tells him of the horrors she witnessed, including a time when an angry Dahmer served her a sandwich made with possible human remains. Disgusted, Jackson vows to hold the Milwaukee Police accountable for their oversights.\n |\n| 8 | 8 | \"Lionel\" | Gregg Araki | Ian Brennan & David McMillan | September 21, 2022 (2022-09-21) |\n| Lionel is horrified by Dahmer and what he has done. With his wife, he deals with his demons, alternately blaming himself and Joyce. Jesse Jackson continues working on behalf of the victims' families. The two officers who were suspended over Konerak's case are reinstated. Dahmer goes to trial after his insanity plea is denied. After he is sentenced to 15 life terms and victim statements are heard, Dahmer is given a chance to speak. He says he knows he is mentally ill, and apologizes to the families. Lionel finds writing a book about being Jeffrey's father to be therapeutic.\n |\n| 9 | 9 | \"The Bogeyman\" | Jennifer Lynch | Ian Brennan & David McMillan & Reilly Smith | September 21, 2022 (2022-09-21) |\n| Family members of Dahmer's victims deal with grief, fear, sleeplessness and nightmares. After convincing Shirley to sue Lionel Dahmer over the profits of his book, lawyer Joe Zilber brings a $14 million lawsuit against the City of Milwaukee on behalf of the victims' families. Lionel learns that any profits from his book will be paid to victims' families. In prison, Dahmer begins receiving \"fan mail\", with several people sending him money in exchange for autographed items. He obliges and sends them back.\n |\n| 10 | 10 | \"God of Forgiveness, God of Vengeance\" | Paris Barclay | Ian Brennan & David McMillan & Reilly Smith & Todd Kubrak | September 21, 2022 (2022-09-21) |\n| After attending a church service in prison, Dahmer asks to be baptized, near the same time as John Wayne Gacy's execution. The $14 million lawsuit is settled out of court for less than $900,000. Joe Zilber, angered that people plan to profit by selling items removed from Dahmer's home, offers the dealers double their asking price. He then gives every victim's family a share of what he paid, saying all the items will be destroyed. An inmate named Christopher Scarver kills Dahmer and another inmate, Jesse Anderson, with a metal bar, saying that God told him to commit the murder. Per Dahmer's wishes, his body is cremated, and no funeral is held, but his brain is kept for scientific research. Lionel insists that the brain also be destroyed, while Joyce wants it to be studied. Lionel explains that he and the victims' families just want closure, which would be made more difficult by retaining the brain. A judge sides with Lionel, and the brain is cremated. As Milwaukee residents watch, the Oxford Apartments are destroyed. Glenda meets with a city official to advocate for the site of the apartments to be turned into a memorial for the victims, but is warned that it will be a lengthy process. The photos and names of Dahmer's victims are displayed in the closing titles, which also state that no memorial has yet been built.\n |\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Audience viewership[edit]\n\n\nThe series rose to the number one spot on Netflix in the first week of its release.[13] In the second week of its release, Netflix announced that *Dahmer* was its ninth most popular English-language TV show of all time, with 56 million households having viewed all 10 episodes.[14][15][16] The series remained number-one for weeks and became Netflix’s second most-viewed English Netflix series of all time, and the fourth highest across any language with 701.37 million hours viewed in 21 days.[4] The series amassed more than 865 million hours viewed in the first 28 days of its release.[17] In 60 days it became the third Netflix series to pass 1 billion views.[18]\n\n\n*Dahmer* debuted at number-one on the Nielsen Top 10 streaming chart by garnering more than 3.6 billion minutes of viewing for the week of September 19–25, placing it 10th on the all-time list for single-week viewership.[19] The following week, it jumped to No. 7 on the all-time list with 4.4 billion minutes viewed.[16] The series topped Nielsen's streaming chart for the third consecutive week with 2.3 billion viewing minutes.[20]\n\n\nJermey Dick of *MovieWeb* stated that on \"October 3rd through the 9th the views of the Dahmer series made up to 205 million hours streamed\" into watching the show for that period, overall making it up to \"701 million hours watched globally\".[21]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 57% approval rating with an average rating of 6.3/10, based on 30 critic reviews. The website's critics consensus says: \"While *Monster* is seemingly self-aware of the peril in glorifying Jeffrey Dahmer, creator Ryan Murphy's salacious style nevertheless tilts this horror story into the realm of queasy exploitation.\"[22] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 46 out of 100 based on 9 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[23]\n\n\nKayla Cobb at *Decider* said the show \"isn't just well directed, written, and acted. It's rewriting what a crime drama can look like if we stop glorifying murderers and start focusing more on systematic failures.\"[24] Caroline Framke of *Variety* argues that the show \"simply can't rise to its own ambition of explaining both the man and the societal inequities his crimes exploited without becoming exploitative in and of itself.\"[25] Malik Peay of the *Los Angeles Times* stated that people felt like the show was for the \"entertainment industry's commercialization of tragedy\".[26] Dan Fienberg of *The Hollywood Reporter* praises episode 6 (\"Silenced\") as \"easily the best episode of the series, an uncomfortably sweet and sad hour of TV that probably should have been the template for the entire show [and]...in placing a Black, deaf, gay character at the center of the narrative, the series is giving voice to somebody whose voice has too frequently been excluded from gawking serial killer portraits.\"[27][28]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\n\n\nAccolades received by

Eric Perry, a relative of victim Errol Lindsey, stated \"I want people to understand this is not just a story or historical fact, these are real people’s lives. [Lindsey] was someone’s son, someone’s brother, someone’s father, someone’s friend that was ripped from [our] lives\".[26]\n\n\nProduction assistant Kim Alsup alleged mistreatment while on set. She stated she was one of two Black crew members below the line on *Dahmer*, adding that \"I was always being called someone else’s name, the only other Black girl who looked nothing like me, and I learned the names for 300 background extras\". Alsup also alleged an \"exhausting\" and \"unsupportive environment,\" stating there were no therapists on set. A spokesperson for Netflix countered this allegation, stating that everyone on set had access to free health and wellness sources, including access to a therapist.[26]\n\n\nShirley Hughes, the mother of Tony Hughes, whose story is told in the sixth episode, spoke out against the series' depiction of events. \"It didn't happen like that,\" Hughes told *The Guardian*.[47]\n\n\n\n## Future[edit]\n\n\nHaving initially ordered the program in 2020 as a limited series,[1] Netflix announced on November 7, 2022, that it had renewed *Monster* as an anthology series, with two further editions based on the lives of \"other monstrous figures\" to be announced.[48]\n\n\nOn May 1, 2023, Netflix announced the second season of the series titled *Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menéndez Story* (2024), which is based on the murder case of the Menéndez brothers.[49] On June 29, 2023, *Deadline Hollywood* reported that Cooper Koch and Nicholas Chavez were cast as Lyle and Erik Menéndez respectively.[3]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** With some dialogue in Lao and American Sign Language\n2. **^** Originally announced under the title ***Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story***,[1] with ***Dahmer*** (stylized in all caps) later added as the main title; on Netflix, *Dahmer* is treated as the main series title with its single \"season\" using the original name.[2] *Monster* subsequently became the overall title for the anthology series.[3]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Andreeva, Nellie (October 2, 2020). \"Netflix Greenlights 'Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story' Limited Series From Ryan Murphy & Ian Brennan; Richard Jenkins Co-Stars, Carl Franklin & Janet Mock EP\". *Deadline Hollywood*.

Its cast includes Lee Jung-jae, Park Hae-soo, Wi Ha-joon, HoYeon Jung, O Yeong-su, Heo Sung-tae, Anupam Tripathi and Kim Joo-ryoung.\n\n\nThe series revolves around a secret contest where 456 players, all of whom are in deep financial hardship, risk their lives to play a series of deadly children's games for the chance to win a ₩45.6 billion prize. The series' title draws from a similarly named Korean children's game. Hwang conceived the idea based on his own economic struggles, as well as the class disparity in South Korea and capitalism. Though he wrote the story in 2009, Hwang couldn't find a production company to fund the idea until Netflix took an interest around 2019 as part of a drive to expand their foreign programming offerings.\n\n\n*Squid Game* was released worldwide on September 17, 2021 to critical acclaim and international attention. It became Netflix's most-watched series and the most-watched program in 94 countries, attracting more than 142 million member households and 1.65 billion viewing hours in its first four weeks, surpassing *Bridgerton* as the service's most-watched show. It has received numerous accolades, including the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film for O Yeong-su, and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series and Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series for Lee Jung-jae and HoYeon Jung, respectively; all three were also the first Korean actors to win in those categories. The first season received 14 Primetime Emmy Award nominations, including for Outstanding Drama Series, making it the first non-English-language work to be nominated in this category; Lee won the Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama series, the first time an Asian actor won the award for a non-English part.\n\n\nA second season was officially announced in June 2022, along with a reality competition series titled *Squid Game: The Challenge*. Filming for the second season began in July 2023.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nSeong Gi-hun, a divorced father and indebted gambler who lives with his elderly mother, is invited to play a series of children's games for a chance at a large cash prize. Accepting the offer, he is taken to an unknown location where he finds himself among 455 other players who are all in deep financial trouble. The players are made to wear green tracksuits and are kept under watch at all times by masked guards in pink jumpsuits, with the games overseen by the Front Man, who wears a black mask and black uniform. The players soon discover that losing a game results in their deaths, with each death contributing ₩100 million to the potential ₩45.6 billion grand prize.[a][b] Gi-hun allies with other players, including his childhood friend Cho Sang-woo and North Korean defector Kang Sae-byeok, to try to survive the games' physical and psychological twists.[5][6]\n\n\n\n## Cast and characters[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of *Squid Game* characters\n\n### Main cast[edit]\n\n\nCast\n![Lee Jung-Jae 2021](image)\nLee Jung-Jae (Seong Gi-hun, Player 456)\n![](image)\nPark Hae-soo (Cho Sang-woo, Player 218)\n![](image)\nWi Ha-joon (Police Officer Hwang Jun-ho)\n![](image)\nJung Ho-yeon (Kang Sae-byeok, Player 067)\n\nNumbers in parentheses denote the character's assigned player number in the *Squid Game* universe.\n\n\n\n* Lee Jung-jae as Seong Gi-hun (성기훈, [sʌŋ gi hun] ⓘ, 456),[7] a divorced chauffeur and gambling addict.

In a subway, a well-dressed man asks him to play a game of *ddakji* for money, and offers an opportunity to play more games with much higher stakes.

The games are overseen by the Front Man, who is masked and dressed in black. Gi-hun befriends Player 001, an elderly man suffering from a brain tumor.

The first game is Red Light, Green Light, where anyone caught moving is shot dead on the spot, revealing the sadistic nature of the games. Half the contestants panic and attempt to flee upon realizing this, turning the game into a massacre. With help from Sang-woo and Player 199, Gi-hun finishes the game alive.\n |\n| 2 | \"Hell\"Transliteration: \"Jiok\" (Korean: 지옥) | Hwang Dong-hyuk | Hwang Dong-hyuk | September 17, 2021 (2021-09-17) |\n| With over half of the players killed in the first game, many survivors demand to be released. Using the game's third clause, they narrowly vote to cancel the game and send everyone home, but without any prize money. Back in Seoul, Gi-hun goes to the police, but no one believes him except Detective Hwang Jun-ho, whose brother received the same invitation card and has recently disappeared. The players are invited to re-enter the game, and many return out of desperation. This includes Gi-hun, whose mother needs surgery; Sang-woo, who is about to be arrested for financial fraud; Player 001, who does not wish to die in the outside world; Player 067, who wishes to rescue her parents from North Korea and get her little brother out of an orphanage; Player 199, a Pakistani migrant worker who attacked and gravely injured his boss for withholding his wages; and Player 101, named Jang Deok-su, a gangster on the run from gambling debts and his ex-bosses. Jun-ho secretly follows Gi-hun when he is picked up by the guards.\n |\n| 3 | \"The Man with the Umbrella\"Transliteration: \"Usan-eul Sseun Namja\" (Korean: 우산을 쓴 남자) | Hwang Dong-hyuk | Hwang Dong-hyuk | September 17, 2021 (2021-09-17) |\n| Jun-ho successfully infiltrates the games by disguising himself as a masked worker, and it is revealed that the location is a remote island. The players are now more prepared and start forming alliances. Gi-hun, Sang-woo, Player 001, and Player 199 team up. Player 067 explores an air vent and witnesses workers melting pots of sugar. The second game is revealed to be *Ppopgi*, where each player must perfectly extract a stamped shape from a *dalgona* (honeycomb candy) under a 10-minute time limit. Sang-woo learns of Player 067's discovery and recognizes the game beforehand, but does not warn his teammates and chooses the simplest shape for himself. Gi-hun ends up picking the most difficult shape, an umbrella, but is able to complete the game by licking the back of the honeycomb to melt it. Player 212, a rowdy and manipulative woman, helps Deok-su complete the game with a smuggled lighter. A player about to be executed takes a guard hostage and forces him to unmask. Shocked that the staff member is a young man, the player shoots himself, and the guard is killed by the Front Man for revealing his identity.\n |\n| 4 | \"Stick to the Team\"Transliteration: \"Jjollyeodo Pyeonmeokgi\" (Korean: 쫄려도 편먹기) | Hwang Dong-hyuk | Hwang Dong-hyuk | September 17, 2021 (2021-09-17) |\n| Player 111, a disgraced doctor, secretly works with a handful of guards to harvest organs from dead players to sell on the black market, in return for information on upcoming games. When Deok-su kills a player accusing him of taking extra food, the guards do nothing to stop him, and the prize money's value is increased. Realizing they could freely kill other players to increase the prize money, Deok-su and his gang start a massive riot after lights out, resulting in players attacking each other. Gi-hun's group survives and exchange names to build trust: Player 199 is Ali Abdul, and Player 067 is Kang Sae-byeok. Player 001, because of his brain tumor, has trouble remembering his name. Player 212, named Han Mi-nyeo, has sex with Deok-su. In the third game, players are told to form groups of ten. For Gi-hun's team, Sae-byeok recruits Player 240, a girl close to her age. The game is revealed to be tug of war on two raised platforms, where a team wins by dragging the opposing team off the other platform to their deaths. Deok-su, having learned of the game from Player 111 beforehand, picks only strong men and rejects Mi-nyeo, who joins Gi-hun's team. After Deok-su's team wins their match handily, Gi-hun's team struggles against another all-male team.\n |\n| 5 | \"A Fair World\"Transliteration: \"Pyeongdeung-han Sesang\" (Korean: 평등한 세상) | Hwang Dong-hyuk | Hwang Dong-hyuk | September 17, 2021 (2021-09-17) |\n| Gi-hun's team wins their tug-of-war match with Player 001's strategy and Sang-woo's quick thinking. Anticipating another riot, they build a barricade and spend the night taking turns on guard, but Deok-su's team does not attack. Gi-hun reminisces on a similar situation from ten years ago, when he and many other workers from an automobile factory protested a mass lay-off, which caused the failed trajectory of Gi-hun's life. Player 240 attempts to befriend Sae-Byeok, but she does not reciprocate. Jun-ho witnesses the organ harvesting racket, as the guard whose identity he stole took part in it. Player 111 turns on the racketeers when the guards are unable to tell him what the next game is. Except Jun-ho, everyone involved in the racket is eventually killed, including Player 111. The Front Man begins a facility-wide manhunt for Jun-ho, who breaks into the Front Man's office. Jun-ho learns that the game has been running for over 30 years, and that his elder brother Hwang In-ho was the winner in 2015.\n |\n| 6 | \"Gganbu\"Transliteration: \"Kkanbu\" (Korean: 깐부) | Hwang Dong-hyuk | Hwang Dong-hyuk | September 17, 2021 (2021-09-17) |\n| The players see the bodies of Player 111 and his co-conspirators strung up for cheating, and are assured that the games are designed to give every player a fair chance without discrimination. For the fourth game, players are told to pair up, but discover that instead of working as a team, they will have to play against their partner in a marble game of their choice. Whoever gets all their partner's marbles within 30 minutes will win and survive. Sae-byeok and Player 240, named Ji-yeong, share their life stories; Ji-yeong sees Sae-byeok has more to live for and sacrifices herself. Sang-woo tricks Ali into giving up his marbles and wins. Deok-su wins against his partner and henchman, Player 278. Gi-hun exploits Player 001's dementia to defeat him, only to discover that the old man was aware of the deception the entire time. Player 001, who remembers his name to be Oh Il-nam, allows Gi-hun to win anyway, as he is his *gganbu* (trusted friend). Gi-hun and Sae-byeok are traumatized by the deaths of their friends.\n |\n| 7 | \"VIPS\" | Hwang Dong-hyuk | Hwang Dong-hyuk | September 17, 2021 (2021-09-17) |\n| The players return to find Mi-nyeo, who did not have a partner for the marbles game, still alive. Foreign VIPs, who had been wagering on the games remotely, arrive to watch and wager on the next rounds live. Jun-ho, posing as one of the masked servants, is sexually propositioned by one of them. In a private room, he attacks the VIP, records his confession, and escapes the island. Meanwhile, the fifth game has players crossing a two-panel wide bridge, where the panels are each made of either tempered or regular glass, the latter of which cannot support their weight. The players at the front of the line fall to their deaths as they progressively test the panels. Deok-su refuses to move despite the clock ticking, daring others to pass him. Mi-nyeo grabs him and, as revenge for betraying her, pulls him down with her to their deaths. Player 017, a seasoned glass worker, is able to determine which panels are safe until the Front Man turns off the lights, removing his advantage. With time running out, Sang-woo pushes Player 017 to his death, revealing the last trick panel. Only Gi-hun, Sang-woo, and Sae-byeok complete the game; at its conclusion, explosions shatter the remaining panels and injure the three players.\n |\n| 8 | \"Front Man\"Transliteration: \"Peuronteumaen\" (Korean: 프론트맨) | Hwang Dong-hyuk | Hwang Dong-hyuk | September 17, 2021 (2021-09-17) |\n| As finalists, Gi-hun, Sang-woo, and Sae-byeok are given a change of outfit to formal clothes. Sae-byeok hides a severe stab wound she received from the glass bridge explosion. After eating dinner, each player is left with a steak knife. Gi-hun suggests to Sae-byeok that they should ally against Sang-woo, realizing he will do anything to win. Sae-byeok instead begs Gi-hun to promise that whoever wins the game will look after the other's loved ones. Gi-hun goes to kill Sang-woo when he falls asleep, but Sae-byeok stops him, telling him he is not a murderer. Sae-byeok's injury worsens, prompting Gi-hun to call for help. When Gi-hun is away, Sang-woo kills Sae-byeok and the guards arrive only to collect her corpse. Furious and heartbroken, Gi-hun tries to attack Sang-woo but is prevented by the guards. Meanwhile, Jun-ho makes it to another island but is quickly tracked down by the Front Man and the guards. To Jun-ho's shock, the Front Man reveals himself to be his brother, In-ho, who tries to recruit him. When he refuses, In-ho shoots Jun-ho in the shoulder, causing him to fall back over a cliff edge and into the sea.\n |\n| 9 | \"One Lucky Day\"Transliteration: \"Unsu Joeun Nal\" (Korean: 운수 좋은 날)[e] | Hwang Dong-hyuk | Hwang Dong-hyuk | September 17, 2021 (2021-09-17) |\n| In the final eponymous Squid game, Gi-hun defeats Sang-woo after a brutal fight but refuses to kill him; he begs Sang-Woo to stop the game using the third clause. Sang-woo instead stabs himself in the neck, and asks Gi-hun to take care of his mother before dying. Gi-hun is returned to Seoul with a bank card to access the prize money, but discovers his own mother has died. A year later, Gi-hun remains traumatized and has not touched his prize money out of guilt. He receives an invitation card from his *gganbu*, and finds Oh Il-nam on his deathbed. Il-nam reveals he created the game to entertain bored wealthy people like himself. He chose games he played as a child, and participated in Gi-hun's group out of nostalgia. As they talk, Il-nam wagers with Gi-hun on whether an unconscious man lying on a street corner will be helped before midnight. The man is saved, and Il-nam dies shortly after. Gi-hun retrieves Sae-byeok's brother and has him looked after by Sang-woo's mother, and gives them a share of the prize money. As Gi-hun travels to the airport to reconnect with his daughter in Los Angeles, he sees the same game recruiter playing ddakji with another desperate player, but manages only to get that player's invitation card. He calls the card's number before boarding his plane, demanding to know who is running the games. The person behind the phone number curtly orders him to get on the plane, but Gi-hun ends the call and returns to the terminal.\n |\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\n#### Season 1[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Series creator and director Hwang Dong-hyuk.\nAround 2008, Hwang Dong-hyuk had tried unsuccessfully to get investment for a different movie script that he had written, and he, his mother, and his grandmother had to take out loans to stay afloat, but still struggled amid the debt crisis within the country.[31][32][f] He spent his free time in a Manhwabang (South Korean manga cafe) reading Japanese survival manga such as *Battle Royale*, *Liar Game* and *Gambling Apocalypse: Kaiji*.[34][35][36][37] Hwang compared the characters' situation in these works to his own current situation and considered the idea of being able to join such a survival game to win money to get him out of debt, leading him to write a film script on that concept throughout 2009.[37] Hwang stated, \"I wanted to write a story that was an allegory or fable about modern capitalist society, something that depicts an extreme competition, somewhat like the extreme competition of life. But I wanted it to use the kind of characters we've all met in real life.\"[38] Hwang feared the storyline was \"too difficult to understand and bizarre\" at the time.[34] Hwang tried to sell his story to various Korean production groups and actors, but had been told it was too grotesque and unrealistic.[39] Hwang put this script aside without any takers, and over the next ten years successfully completed three other films, including the crime drama film *Silenced* (2011) and the historical drama film *The Fortress* (2017).[37]\n\n\nIn the 2010s, Netflix had seen a large growth in viewership outside of North America, and started investing in productions in other regions, including Korea.[40] Ted Sarandos, co-CEO of Netflix, stated in 2018 that they were looking for more successes from overseas productions: \"The exciting thing for me would be if the next *Stranger Things* came from outside America. Right now, historically, nothing of that scale has ever come from anywhere but Hollywood.\"[41] Netflix had opened up a division in Asia in 2018, and while they were still operating out of temporary leased office space in Seoul, Hwang brought his script to their attention. Kim Minyoung, one of Netflix's content officers for the Asian regions, recognized Hwang's talent from *The Fortress* and his other films, and upon seeing his script for *Squid Game*, knew they needed it for the service. Kim said \"[W]e were looking for shows that were different from what's traditionally 'made it,' and Squid Game was exactly it\".[42] Netflix formally announced in September 2019 they would produce Hwang's work as an original series.[39][43] Netflix's Bela Bajaria, head of global television operations, said that of their interest in Hwang's work, \"we knew it was going to be big in Korea because it had a well-regarded director with a bold vision\", and that \"K-Dramas also travel well across Asia\".[40] Regarding his return to the project, Hwang commented, \"It's a sad story. But the reason why I returned to the project is because the world 10 years from then has transformed to a place where these unbelievable survival stories are so fitting, and I found that this is the time when people will call these stories intriguing and realistic.\"[34] Hwang further believed that the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the economic disparity between classes in South Korea, and said that \"All of these points made the story very realistic for people compared to a decade ago\".[39]\n\n\nWith the Netflix order, the film concept was expanded out to a nine-episode series. Kim stated that there was \"so much more than what was written in the 120-minute format. So we worked together to turn it into a series.\"[42] Hwang said he was able to expand the script so that it \"could focus on the relationships between people [and] the stories that each of the people had\".[44] Initially, Netflix had named the series *Round Six*, rather than *Squid Game* as Hwang had suggested; according to Netflix's vice president for content in Asia Kim Minyoung, while they knew that the name \"squid game\" would be familiar to Korean viewers from the children's game, it \"wouldn't resonate because not many people would get it\", and opted to use *Round Six* as it self-described the nature of the competition. As production continued, Hwang pushed on the service to use *Squid Game* instead; its cryptic name and unique visuals helped to draw in curious viewers, according to Kim.[43][45] At the time that Hwang wrote the series, his goal was for having the series reach the most-watched show in Netflix in the United States for at least one day.[31] Hwang had initially written the series as eight episodes, which was comparable to other Netflix shows, but found that the material for the last episode was longer than he planned, so it was split into two.[46]\n\n\n\n#### Season 2[edit]\n\n\nIn late October 2021, Hwang stated he was in discussions with Netflix regarding a second season.[31] He further stated in December 2021 that he was also discussing a third season with Netflix.[47] Hwang wanted to produce another film first, as well as secure a contract with Netflix to release additional films he may create alongside further *Squid Game* seasons, so as to avoid becoming known only for *Squid Game*.[31] Hwang confirmed that he had begun conceptualization work on a second season during a press event in November 2021, with plans to bring back Lee Jung-jae to reprise his role of Gi-hun.[48] Netflix stated in response to Hwang's comments that they had not yet officially greenlit a second season, but were in discussions with Hwang towards one.[49] During an earnings call in January 2022, Netflix's Sarandos said when asked about a second season \"Absolutely...the *Squid Game* universe has just begun.\"[50][51][52] Hwang said in April 2022 that he presently was working on *Killing Old People Club*, an adaption of a work called \"Pape Satan Aleppe: Chronicles of a Liquid Society\" by Umberto Eco (Korean: 미친 세상을 이해하는 척하는 방법; \"The way to pretend to understand the crazy world\"), and anticipated that the second season of *Squid Game* would be completed and broadcast by 2024.[53] Netflix confirmed that the second season was greenlit in June 2022.[54][55]\n\n\n\n### Writing[edit]\n\n\n#### Season 1[edit]\n\n\nHwang described the work as \"a story about losers\".[56] The names of the characters – Seong Gi-hun, Cho Sang-woo, and Il-nam – were all based on Hwang's childhood friends, as well as the character name Hwang Jun-ho, who was also a childhood friend in real life with an older brother named Hwang In-ho.[37] The two main characters Gi-hun and Sang-woo were based on Hwang's own personal experiences and represented \"two sides\" of himself; Gi-hun shared the same aspects of being raised by an economically disadvantaged single mother in the Ssangmun district of Seoul, while Sang-woo reflected on Hwang having attended Seoul National University with high expectations from his family and neighborhood.[37][56] Further, Gi-hun's background was inspired by the organizers of the SsangYong Motor labor strike of 2009 against mass layoffs.[57]\n\n\n\n![](image)Shapes punched into *dalgona*, a Korean sugar candy treat, based on the shapes used in the second game of the show. Within the show, players had to extract the inner shapes intact.\nHwang based the narrative on Korean games of his childhood to show the irony of a childhood game where competition was not important becoming an extreme competition with people's lives at stake.[35] Additionally, as his initial script was intended for film, he opted to use children's games with simple rules that were easy to explain in contrast to other survival-type films using games with complex rules.[44] The central game he selected, the squid game, was a popular Korean children's game from the 1970s and 1980s.[43][58] Hwang recalled the squid game as \"the most physically aggressive childhood game I played in neighborhood alleys as a kid, which is why I also loved it the most\", and because of this \"it's the most symbolic game that reflects today's competitive society, so I picked it out as the show's title\".[59] The colors of the ddakjis in the initial game, which are blue and red, were inspired from the Korean and Japanese urban legend \"blue paper, red paper\".[60][g] The \"Red light, Green light\" game was selected because of its potential to make a lot of losers in one go. Regarding the selection, Hwang said, \"The game was selected because the scene filled with so many people randomly moving and stopping could be viewed as a ridiculous but a sad group dance.\"[35] Hwang joked that the dalgona candy game they chose may influence sales of dalgona, similar to how sales of Korean *gats* (traditional hats) bloomed after\nthe broadcast of Netflix's series *Kingdom*.[61] Licking the candy to free the shape was something that Hwang said that he had done as a child and brought it into the script.[59] Hwang had considered other Korean children's games such as *Gonggi*, *Dong, Dong, Dongdaemun*, and *Why did you come to my house?* (우리 집에 왜 왔니?, a Korean variant of the Hana Ichi Monme).[35]\n\n\nHwang wrote all of the series himself, taking nearly six months to write the first two episodes alone, after which he turned to friends to get input on moving forward.[38] Hwang also addressed the challenges of preparing for the show which was physically and mentally exhausting, saying that he had forgone dental health while making Season 1 and had to have six teeth pulled by his dentist after production was complete.[34][46] As such, Hwang was initially unsure about a sequel after completing these episodes,[38] though he wrote the ending to keep a potential hook for a sequel in mind.[31] Hwang had considered an alternate ending where Gi-hun would have boarded the plane after concluding his call with the game organizers to see his daughter, but Hwang said of that ending, \"Is that the right way for us to really propose the question or the message that we wanted to convey through the series?\"[62]\n\n\n\n#### Season 2[edit]\n\n\nDue to the stress of writing and producing the first series of nine episodes himself, Hwang initially had no immediate plans to write a second season to *Squid Game*. He did not have well-developed plans for a follow-up story and said that if he were to write one, he would likely need a staff of writers and directors to help him.[38] With the immense popularity of the show, Hwang later opined about the possibility of a second season, telling CNN, \"There's nothing confirmed at the moment, but so many people are enthusiastic that I'm really contemplating it.\"[56] Hwang said in an interview with *The Times* that a second season may focus more on the story of the Front Man as well as incorporating more about the police. Hwang said, \"I think the issue with police officers is not just an issue in Korea. I see it on the global news that the police force can be very late in acting on things—there are more victims or a situation gets worse because of them not acting fast enough. This was an issue that I wanted to raise.\"[63] He added he also wanted to explore the relationship between the cryptic Front Man and his policeman brother Hwang Jun-ho, as well as the background of the salesman character (portrayed by Gong Yoo).[64]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\n#### Season 1[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nDirector Hwang requested that actors Gong Yoo (left) and Lee Byung Hun (right), with whom he had previously worked, appear as the recruiter and the Front Man, respectively, in *Squid Game*.\n\nHwang said he chose to cast Lee Jung-jae as Gi-hun as to \"destroy his charismatic image portrayed in his previous roles\".[65] HoYeon Jung was requested by her new management company to send a video to audition for the series while she was finishing a shoot in Mexico and preparing for New York Fashion Week. Although this was her first audition as an actor and her expectations were low, Hwang said, \"The moment I saw her audition tape from New York, I immediately thought to myself, 'this is the girl we want.' My first impression of her was that she is wild and free like an untamed horse\".[66][67][68] On casting Anupam Tripathi as Ali Abdul, Hwang said, \"It was hard to find good foreign actors in Korea.\" He chose Anupam Tripathi because of his emotional acting capabilities and fluency in Korean.[69] Both Gong Yoo and Lee Byung Hun had worked with Hwang during his previous films, *Silenced* and *The Fortress* respectively, and Hwang had asked both to appear in small roles within *Squid Game*.[66] The VIPs were selected from non-Korean actors living in Asia; in the case of Geoffrey Giuliano, who played the VIP that interacted with Jun-ho, his prior role from *Train to Busan Presents: Peninsula* led to his casting for *Squid Game*.[24]\n\n\nCasting for the series was confirmed on June 17, 2020.[70]\n\n\n\n#### Season 2[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2022, Hwang confirmed that the characters of Gi-hun and the Front Man will return for the second season, and will introduce Cheol-su, Young-hee's boyfriend.[71][54] Hwang said that he would like to bring back some of the dead characters, such as Ji-young, and expressed regret that he had killed off several beloved characters since he did not have any plans for a second season at that time.[72]\n\n\nDuring Netflix's Tudum: A Global Fan Event in June 2023, Lee Jung-jae was confirmed to reprise his role alongside Lee Byung-hun, Gong Yoo and Wi Ha-joon. On June 29, Netflix released more info on the new season's cast, which includes Kang Ha-neul, Park Sung-hoon, Im Si-wan, Yang Dong-geun, Park Gyu-young, Lee Jin-wook, Won Ji-an, Jo Yu-ri, Kang Ae-shim, Lee David, and Roh Jae-won.[73][27][26] Controversy arose when it was revealed that T.O.P, a former member of the band BigBang with a drug-related conviction during military service in 2016, was cast in the second season.[74]\n\n\n\n### Costume, set design, and filming[edit]\n\n\n#### Season 1[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| External videos |\n| --- |\n| ![video icon](image) Squid Game – Behind the Scenes, from Netflix |\n\n\nProduction and filming of the series ran from June to October 2020, including a mandatory month-long break due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[75] City scenes were filmed in Daejeon,[76] while the island set pieces were filmed on Seongapdo located in Ongjin.[77] \n\n![](image)The shapes of *Ojingo* (Squid) played heavily in the graphic design of the show.As Netflix was targeting the work for a global audience, the visuals were emphasized and some of the rules of the children's games were simplified to avoid potential issues with the language barrier.[39] The colorful sets and costumes were designed to look like a fantasy world. The players and soldiers each wear a distinctive color, to reduce the sense of individuality and emphasize the difference between the two groups.[35] The green tracksuits worn by the players were inspired by 1970s athletic wear, known as *trainingbok* (Korean: 트레이닝복).[78] The maze-like corridors and stairs drew inspiration from the 4-dimensional stair drawings of M. C. Escher including *Relativity*. Production designer Chae Kyoung-sun said these seemingly infinite stairways represented \"a form of bondage for the contestants\".[79] The complex network of tunnels between the arena, the dorm, and the administrative office was inspired by ant colonies.[35]\n\n\nChae was also inspired by the Saemaul Undong political initiative of the 1970s aimed to modernize rural Korean villages.[80] The mint green and pink color theme throughout the show were a common theme from Korean schools in the 1970s and 1980s. Green-suited characters develop associations of fear with pink through its use in guard outfits and the stairway room.[81][79]\n\n\nThe players' dormitory was envisioned with the concept of \"people who are abandoned on the road\" according to Chae; this was also used in the tug-of-war game.[81] The room was designed using white tiles and the curved opening like a vehicular tunnel. The bed and stairs initially were laid out to look like warehouse shelves, but as the episodes progressed and these furnishing used as makeshift defenses, they took the appearance of broken ladders and stairs, implying the way these players were trapped with no way out, according to Chae.[81] The dinner scene that took place in the eighth episode was inspired by the art installation *The Dinner Party* by Judy Chicago.[79] Walls of many of the areas where the games took place were painted in skies inspired by *The Empire of Light* series by René Magritte.[79]\n\n\nThe crew spent the most time crafting the set for the Marbles game, creating a mix of realism and fakeness as to mirror the life and death nature of the games themselves.[82] Chae stated that this set was designed as a combination of small theatrical stages, each stage representing parts of Player 001's memories.[81] The VIP room was one of the last pieces to be designed, and Chae said that they decided on an animal-based theme for both the costumes and room for this; \"The VIPs are the kind of people who take other people's lives for entertainment and treat them like game pieces on a chessboard, so I wanted to create a powerful and instinctive look for the room.\"[81]\n\n\nMost sets were a combination of practical sets and chroma key backgrounds. For example, in the Glass Stepping Stones scenes, the set, designed as if in a circus tent for the players performing for the VIPs, was only 1.5 metres (4.9 ft) off the ground, using chroma key screens to simulate the height in post-production. In filming, this was far enough from the ground to make the actors nervous, which contributed to the scene.[82][81] The tug-of-war set was actually set more than 10 metres (33 ft) off the ground, which further created anxiety for some of the actors with fears of heights.[81]\n\n\nThe robot doll in the first episode, \"Red Light, Green Light\", was inspired by Younghee, a character who appeared on the covers of Korean textbooks *Chul-soo and Young-hee* in the 1970s and 1980s,[79] and her hairstyle was inspired by Hwang's daughter's.[78][81] The doll singsongs, in Korean, \"Mugunghwa flower has blossomed\", referring to the *hibiscus syriacus*, the national flower of South Korea.[59] The use of this familiar character was meant to juxtapose memories of childhood and unsettling fear in the players, according to Chae.[81] Similarly, the set for the dalgona game, using giant pieces of playground equipment, were to evoke players' memories of their childhood, and was a common place where Korean children would have played dalgona with friends.[81] The dalgona used in \"The Man with the Umbrella\" were made by a street vendor from Daehangno.[83]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe Korean and English language title logos incorporated the circle, triangle and square shapes into their design.\n\nThroughout the series, the trio of circle, triangle, and square shapes appear frequently on the cards given to recruit players, on the guards' masks, and inside the show's title. These are shapes associated with the playing field for the children's game of Squid (*Ojing-eo*). They are also used to represent the hierarchy of the guards within the complex. Following from the comparison with an ant colony, the guards with circles are considered the workers, triangles as the soldiers, and squares as the managers (see also: Korean honorifics). Further, in the Korean alphabet, Hangul, the circle represents the romanized letter \"O\", the triangle represents part of the letter \"J\", and the square represents the letter \"M\"; together, \"OJM\" are the romanized initials of *Ojing-eo Geim*, the Korean translation of *Squid Game*.[84]\n\n\n\n#### Season 2[edit]\n\n\nPrincipal photography for the second season was scheduled to start in July 2023 and was expected to last for \"at least 10 months\".[85] On July 10, staff members of the production faced a controversy involving allegations of mistreatment towards citizens during filming at Incheon Airport. The production company issued an official apology on the matter.[86] Filming was reportedly underway in August 2023.[87]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nSee also: *Squid Game* (soundtrack)\n\n![](image)Jung Jae-il composed the score for the series.\nJung Jae-il, who previously composed the soundtrack for *Parasite*, composed and directed *Squid Game*'s score.[88] To prevent it from becoming boring, he asked the help of composers Park Min-ju, and Kim Sung-soo, a music director for musicals who uses the stage name \"23\" as a composer.[89]\n\n\nTwo classical music pieces are also used throughout the show as part of the players' routine: the third movement of Joseph Haydn's \"Trumpet Concerto\" is used to wake the players, and Johann Strauss II's \"The Blue Danube\" is used to indicate the start of a new game.[88] Ludwig van Beethoven's \"Fifth Symphony\" is also heard in the VIP lounge.[88] A cover of \"Fly Me to the Moon\",[h] arranged by Jung and sung by Korean artist Joo Won Shin, was used over the \"Red Light, Green Light\" game of the first episode; according to Joo, Hwang wanted a contrast between the brutal killing of the players and the \"romantic and beautiful lyrics and melody\" of the song, such that the scene \"embodies the increasingly polarized capitalist society that we live in today in a very compressed and cynical way\".[90]\n\n\nFor the song \"Way Back Then\" that accompanies children playing Squid Game, Jung wanted to use instruments that he practiced in elementary school, such as recorders and castanets.[89] The rhythm of the song is based on a 3-3-7 clapping rhythm that is commonly used in South Korea to cheer someone on.[89] The recorder, played by Jung himself, had a slight \"beep\", which was unintentional.[91] The song \"Round VI\" was played by the Budapest Scoring Orchestra.[92]\n\n\nThe soundtrack was released on September 17, 2021.[93]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A promotional event for *Squid Game* in Shibuya, Tokyo\nIn the Philippines, a replica of the doll used in the episode one of the series was exhibited on Ortigas Avenue in Quezon City in September 2021.[94]\n\n\nA *Squid Game* doll was installed in Olympic Park, Seoul on October 25, 2021.[95] A replica of *Squid Game*'s set was exhibited at the Itaewon station in Seoul since September 5, 2021.[96][97] However, the exhibit was prematurely closed due to COVID-19 concerns.[98]\n\n\nA *Squid Game* pop-up store opened in Paris on October 2 and 3, 2021,[99] and a person could win a free one-month Netflix subscription if they managed to get the right shape from the dalgona in one minute and 30 seconds.[100][101]\n\n\nIn the Netherlands, Netflix hosted its own Squid Game where people were able to play the game *Red Light, Green Light* in both Maastricht and Rotterdam. A replica of the doll was exhibited and staff were dressed as guards. Winners were awarded with Squid Game memorabilia. The event attracted hundreds of people.[102][103][104] Similar events featuring replicas of the doll have occurred across the world, including Sydney[105] and the United Kingdom.[106]\n\n\nIn October 2021, the *Hollywood Reporter* interviewed Netflix Asia's executive Kim Minyoung, who said that the company was looking into a possible video game adaptation of the series.[45]\n\n\nNetflix has licensed *Squid Game* for merchandising. A Young-hee vinyl figure was released in January 2022.[107] Funko released a set of *Squid Game* themed Funko Pop! figurines in May 2022.[108]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Critical reception[edit]\n\n\nThe show received critical acclaim.[109] On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the series has an approval rating of 95% based on 76 reviews, with an average rating of 8.1/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \"*Squid Game*'s unflinching brutality is not for the faint of heart, but sharp social commentary and a surprisingly tender core will keep viewers glued to the screen – even if it's while watching between their fingers.\"[110] On Metacritic, the series has a weighted average score of 69 out of 100 based on 13 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[111]\n\n\nJoel Keller of *Decider* opined that the concept of the show was creative. When writing about the narrative, he described it as \"a tight narrative and a story that has the potential to be tense and exciting\". Keller concluded, \"STREAM IT. *Squid Game* takes a fresh idea and spins it into a thrilling drama; we hope it continues to build the tension we saw in the last 20 minutes throughout the season.\"[112] Pierce Conran of the *South China Morning Post* rated the series with 4.5 out of 5 stars and wrote, \"Overall, this is still a savagely entertaining slam dunk from Netflix Korea, which is likely to be embraced around the world as its predecessors were.\"[113] Hidzir Junaini of *NME* rated the series with 4 out of 5 stars and opined, \"Thematic intelligence aside, *Squid Game* is also a white-knuckle watch, thanks to its visceral competition element.\"[114] John Doyle of *The Globe and Mail* described the series as \"a brave, dark, ambitious tale, at times moving and at times terrifying\" and added, \"Its power is in its understanding that money is survival. This is not some dystopian fantasy like *Hunger Games*. This is present-day life in all its complex awfulness.\"[115]\n\n\nKarl Quinn of *The Age* described the series as \"enormously derivative\", but wrote: \"there are two tensions that elevate *Squid Game*. One is within the narrative, where the primacy of the individual is in direct combat with the notion of community, and where the illusion of \"choice\" justifies all manner of exploitation.\"[116] S. Poorvaja of *The Hindu* wrote that \"the nine episodes manage to leave its viewers horrified, yet invested in the show, thanks to the razor-sharp writing and compelling performances by its ensemble cast\".[117] Abha Shah of the *Evening Standard* wrote that the series was \"tightly written, each episode packed with enough pace to make it truly binge worthy\", and praised its themes as being \"universally engaging\".[118] Hugo Rifkind of *The Times* described parts of the series as being \"glacially slow\", but stated that it was \"definitely interesting\", and wrote: \"Behind it all, there's an almost Lovecraftian sense of horror, to do with normal lives being unliveable, and huge, unknowable powers in the background that will smirk while you die.\"[119]\n\n\nWriting for *The New York Times*, TV critic Mike Hale found *Squid Game* to be an \"utterly traditional, and thoroughly predictable ... melodrama\" with \"eye-catching\" but \"not especially interesting ... production design and costuming\". He also thought the series' \"pretense of contemporary social relevance\" failed to justify its \"more than mildly sickening\" violence, and thought its characters were \"shallow assemblages of family and typical battlefield\".[120] Daniel D'Addario of *Variety* wrote: \"Like *Joker*, there's a having-it-both-ways insistence that a culture that could create violence is inherently sick and deranged, while playing out a wildly overstated version of sick derangement in a manner designed to be maximally tense and amusing.\"[121]\n\n\nDue to the popularity of *Squid Game*, Singapore's national newspaper *The Straits Times* named the show's director Hwang as *The Straits Times Asian of the Year* in December 2021.[122]\n\n\n\n### Viewership[edit]\n\n\nThe series became the first Korean drama to top Netflix's top ten weekly most-watched TV show charts globally. It reached number one in 94 countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom.[123] Netflix estimated that *Squid Game* had drawn over 111 million member households worldwide after 17 days of availability,[124][i] and over 142 million member households after 28 days,[125] surpassing the 82 million that *Bridgerton* had received in its first 28 days in December 2020, and becoming the service's most-watched series at its launch.[126] After Netflix revamped its published metrics of viewership in November 2021 based on total hours watched of the series, *Squid Game* remained the most-watched show on the service, with over 1.65 billion hours within its first 28 days compared to *Bridgerton*'s 625 million hours.[127] Although Netflix is not available in mainland China, pirated versions of *Squid Game* have been widely circulated on the Chinese Internet, making the show a popular topic on Chinese social networking sites.[128] As of July 2022, *Squid Game* remained the most-watched show on Netflix based on the first 28 days of viewing, ahead of *Stranger Things 4*.[129][130]\n\n\nOutside of Asian regions, the show's popularity was driven primarily through word of mouth and viral spread on social media. *Vulture* also claimed that the show's widespread localization, with subtitles in 37 languages and dubbed versions in 34 languages, helped to capture an international audience.[41] Hwang believed that the show's popularity was due to \"the irony that hopeless grownups risk their lives to win a kids' game\", as well as the familiarity and simplicity of the games that allowed the show to focus on characterization.[131] The diversity of the characters that play the Squid Game, drawing from different walks of lower- and middle-class life, also helps draw audiences to watch as many could find sympathy in one or more of the characters.[131]\n\n\n*Squid Game* had not broken into the Nielsen ratings for streaming media on its first week of availability, but for the week of September 20 through 26, 2021, it was the most-viewed show on streaming services in the United States, with over 1.9 billion minutes watched.[132] It remained the top-viewed program on streaming media from September 27 to October 3, 2021, reaching over 3.26 billion minutes watched in the U.S. These ratings made it the most-viewed streaming program to date in 2021, and the sixth such program to reach over 3 billion minutes watched in a single week since the introduction of Nielsen's streaming media ratings.[133][j] This is the only record achieved in a single season without COVID-19 lockdowns.[134] *Squid Game* remained the most-watched show according to Nielsen for the weeks starting October 4 and 11, 2021,[135][136] but was ousted by *You* in the following week.[137] For four consecutive weeks, *Squid Game* remained as the most watched series on TV tracking service *TV Time*, where it also became the most followed Korean series to date.[138] On YouTube, *Squid Game* related content generated 17 billion views within eight weeks, the highest for a television show, surpassing the viewership generated by *Game of Thrones* related content in ten years.[139] Nielsen reported that *Squid Game* was the second-most watched original series in the United States on streaming services for all of 2021 behind *Lucifer*.[140]\n\n\nAccording to *Bloomberg News*, by October 2021, Netflix estimated that *Squid Game* had generated nearly US$900 million in value based on extended viewer data;[141] it cost $21.4 million to produce.[142] Due to *Squid Game*'s surprising success for Netflix, operators of other streaming services with original content, such as Disney+, Paramount+ and Apple TV+, have begun looking to follow Netflix's model of discovering regional content beyond Hollywood and finding similarly successful works for their platforms, with one executive calling this an area of \"unlimited potential\".[143] Besides bringing new ideas and veering from common themes of typical Hollywood productions, such foreign productions are typically less expensive to make, with tax breaks or incentives by the host country for filming and production.[144] Several producers of non-US TV series, who had little luck in pitching their shows to US-based streaming services in the past, were hopeful that these services would now seriously consider their works as a result of *Squid Game*'s success.[143]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of awards and nominations received by *Squid Game*\n\nO Yeong-su's Golden Globe win made him the first Korean-born actor to win the award. The show's four SAG Award nominations also made history in it becoming the first non-English series and first Korean series to be nominated for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series. Individually, Lee Jung-jae became the first male actor from Asia and Korea to receive an individual SAG Award nomination and HoYeon Jung became the second actress of Asian as well as Korean descent to do the same.[145] With both performers winning, the show made history in becoming the first non-English language television series to win at the SAG Awards. The show also received 14 nominations for the Primetime Emmy Awards, including for Best Drama, making it the first non-English show to be nominated in this category.[146]\n\n\n\n### Public response and impact[edit]\n\n\n![](image)People cosplaying as guards from the series.\n*Squid Game* was considered one of the latest examples of the Korean wave, the growing trend of popular South Korean media to gain international attention since the late 2010s, similar to popular Korean pop acts like BTS and Korean dramas and films like *Parasite*. Such works had drawn more attention due to streaming services like Netflix and YouTube making South Korean content, traditionally controlled by the country's national broadcasters, available across the globe. Further, according to Choe Sang-Hun of *The New York Times*, South Korean creators have a way of taking ideas from foreign works and applying their own cultural spin on it that draws in more audiences.[147]\n\n\nWhile all of the actors saw increases in followers on their social media accounts in the weeks after *Squid Game* premiered, HoYeon Jung saw one of the largest increases, going from about 400,000 to over 13 million followers in three weeks after *Squid Game* premiered,[148] and reaching over 23.5 million by November 2021.[149] In October 2021, the fashion brand Louis Vuitton announced Jung as their new global ambassador for fashion, watches, and jewelry; creative director Nicolas Ghesquière said he \"immediately fell in love with Jung's great talent and fantastic personality\" from her performance on *Squid Game*.[150] O Yeong-su, who had a modest career in Korean theater and film prior to *Squid Game*, was surprised by his newfound fame following the show, making him feel like he was \"floating on air\". Lacking a casting agent, he had to turn to help from his daughter to handle the volume of calls asking him to appear in various roles.[151] Several major talent agencies sought to sign Hwang and the lead actors of *Squid Game* in the months after its debut, with Jung being the first to sign on with Creative Artists Agency by mid-November 2021.[149]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cosplay of Squid Game players for Halloween in Tokyo, 2021\nIn South Korea, the popularity of *Squid Game* led to a surge of network traffic which caused SK Broadband to file a lawsuit against Netflix, seeking monetary damages to pay for increased broadband usage and maintenance costs associated with the program.[152] By September 2023, both SK Broadband and Netflix agreed to drop the lawsuit and instead opted to become partners, with SK Broadband packaging Netflix as part of its services.[153] One of the phone numbers used in the show belonged to a private resident who reported receiving up to 4,000 calls each day from people, several of whom desired to play a real-life version of the game;[154] Netflix stated they would edit the show to remove the number.[155]\n\n\nVendors of dalgona, the honeycomb candy featured in the second game, both within Korea and internationally found a significant increase in sales after the show's release.[156][157] Everyday clothing items matching those worn in the show saw large growths in sales in the weeks after the show's initial broadcast, such as Vans slip-on shoes which spiked by 7,800%. *Variety* attributed this sales increase in part to preparation for Halloween costumes inspired by the show.[158][159][160] Vendors of other costume props that mirrored those in the show, such as the guards' masks, also saw sales spikes in advance of Halloween following the show's premiere.[161] The garment industry in South Korea saw a brief resurgence as demand for green tracksuits based on the show grew.[162]\n\n\nNetflix claimed that *Squid Game* had \"pierced the cultural zeitgeist\" and became a popular Internet meme, with over 42 billion views of videos related to *Squid Game* in the first month after broadcast.[125] Analytics firm Vobile stated that by November 2021, *Squid Game*-related videos on YouTube totaled over 17 billion views, surpassing *Game of Thrones* in the same metric.[163] On October 16, 2021, an episode of the American late-night live television sketch comedy and variety show *Saturday Night Live*, featuring guest host Rami Malek and cast member Pete Davidson, parodied *Squid Game* by singing a country song about the series. As of November 5, 2021, the song has over 9.6 million views on *Saturday Night Live*'s YouTube channel.[164][165] In November 2021, American YouTuber Jimmy Donaldson aka MrBeast recreated *Squid Game* in real life with 456 people competing in similar but non-lethal games as the show for a $456,000 cash prize.[166] The video drew more than 303.5 million views as of November 15, 2022, making it one of the most-watched YouTube videos of 2021.[167] Series creator Hwang has reacted positively to the recreations and parodies.[168] Google reported that *Squid Game* was the most-searched television show on search engine in 2021,[169] while Twitter said that *Squid Game* was the most-tweeted about television show of 2021.[170]\n\n\nShortly after the show's release, users of social media adapted some of the games featured in *Squid Game* as Internet challenges, including the first \"Red Light, Green Light\" game and the second honeycomb cookie game.[171] Users of video games supporting user-created content, such as *Roblox*, *Fortnite Creative*, and *Grand Theft Auto Online*, created numerous games within these systems that were based on one or more of the *Squid Game* challenges.[172][173][174] A video game named *Crab Game* was also created in response to *Squid Game*'s popularity.[175] Some groups also worked to organize safe, mock *Squid Game* events for fans of the show.[176][177] Concerns have been raised about children's exposure to *Squid Game* from either watching it or through its viral popularity, as it is considered to have a high level of violence for that age group.[178] A number of schools around the United Kingdom observed that despite the show being aimed at mature audiences, young children were emulating some of the games from *Squid Game* during school recess, and warned parents about these activities.[179] Parents and school boards in Quebec, Canada and in the Fayetteville-Manlius Central School District of New York have also observed young children emulating games from *Squid Game* and taken steps such as warning parents and banning such activities from school grounds.[180][181]\n\n\nChinese online video platform Youku announced plans in October 2021 to launch the show *Squid Victory* (鱿鱼的胜利, *Yóuyú de Shènglì*) in 2022. The upcoming show, initially named *Victory of Squid*, was heavily criticized by Chinese netizens after it was discovered that it had plagiarized the plot and themes of *Squid Game*. After facing criticism, the company apologized and stated that the show's poster and the title were abandoned. Youku later shared a new poster and announced that the show's name has been changed to *Game's Victory*.[182][183][184]\n\n\n*Squid Game* has been accused of plagiarizing the 2014 Japanese movie *As the Gods Will*, as both involve children's games where the penalty for losing is death. However, writer-director Hwang Dong-hyuk claimed he wrote *Squid Game*'s script in 2009 (5 years before *As the Gods Will* was released), saying \"the similarities that were pointed out are purely coincidental and there is no copying from either party\".[185]\n\n\n\nThe show was used as the basis for an unaffiliated short-lived cryptocurrency scam named SQUID, which had started trading in late October 2021. The currency was poised to be used eventually to back a site for online games where player would buy tokens to play in games inspired by *Squid Game*, with those buying the currency helping to support the investment of the site, with the currency's value to increase as more players used the site. The currency had drawn enough buyers to increase in value by over 2,300% within a day of trading, but news organizations like the BBC identified that the scheme appears to be a \"rug pull\" scam due to several red flags in the proposition.[186] By November 1, 2021, the backers of the currency completely pulled out, crashing the currency and effectively making off with $2.1 million.[187]\n\n\nYouTuber and member of the Yogscast network Lydia Ellery, who had used the handles \"Squid Game\" and \"SquidGaming\" for 11 years, was refused work because of her handle's perceived association with the show. She has also been subject to harassment by fans of *Squid Game* who \"thought [she] took the account from the show\", with some fans attempting to hack into her accounts.[188]\n\n\n\n## Themes and analysis[edit]\n\n\n### Capitalism and economic disparity[edit]\n\n\nHwang wrote *Squid Game* based on his own personal experiences and observations of capitalism and economic class struggles within South Korea.[38] Hwang also considered that his script was targeted towards global issues regarding capitalism, stating, \"I wanted to create something that would resonate not just for Korean people but globally. This was my dream.\" He added, \"I do believe that the overall global economic order is unequal and that around 90% of the people believe that it's unfair. During the pandemic, poorer countries can't get their people vaccinated. They're contracting viruses on the streets and even dying. So I did try to convey a message about modern capitalism. As I said, it's not profound.\"[31]\n\n\nCommentators agreed that these themes applied to capitalism across the globe today.[115][189][190][191][192] *The Guardian*'s Nemo Kim and Justin McCurry describe that the situation that many of the players in *Squid Game* leading to their debt reflects the reality of the South Korean personal debt crisis, which had exceeded 100% of the country's gross domestic product at the time the show first broadcast. Rising debt had led to the government placing restrictions on borrowing practices to try to prevent people from falling further in debt, but this itself had the impact of making other borrowers finding themselves unable to pay back loans without taking out higher-interest loans, creating a rapid cascading effect.[193] Many Koreans in these situations, often named as the \"dirt spoon\" class, turn to risky propositions, such as high-risk investments, cryptocurrency, or gambling, anticipating a big payoff but end up further in debt and exacerbating the problem, according to The Associated Press's Kim Tong-Hyung.[194][195] The use of *trainingbok* outfits for the players was said to allude to their connotation with *baeksu*, roughly translated as \"white hands\", people that have not been able to gain financial independence and discriminated by society as they often spend their days idle and doing no work, according to Indiana University professor Jooyoung Shin.[80]\n\n\nBrian Lowry of CNN wrote that the series \"presents a visually arresting variation on themes seen plenty of times before, which include tapping into the class divide – and the rich essentially preying on the poor and destitute – at a moment when the audience might be more receptive to that message\".[196] Henry Wong of *The Guardian* compared the show favorably to the 2019 South Korean film *Parasite*, and said that the show used the \"present-day, very real wealth inequality\" in South Korea as a backdrop to keep the viewer interested in its characters.[197] Caitlyn Clark of American socialist magazine *Jacobin* also compared the series favorably to *Parasite* and said that it \"shreds the capitalist myth that hard work guarantees prosperity\".[198] Melanie McFarland of the American liberal website *Salon.com* described the series as \"an excellent distillation of how predatory capitalism works\".[199] E. Tammy Kim of American progressive magazine *The Nation* wrote: \"*Squid Game* is not a subtle show, either in its politics or plot. Capitalism is bloody and mean and relentless; it yells.\"[189] Morgan Ome of *The Atlantic* wrote that the series \"fits into a category of South Korean works that grapple with economic anxieties and class struggles, which are rooted in the country's concerns but resonate globally\", adding that it \"indicts the rich for propagating a false sense of upward mobility and the poor for buying into it\".[200]\n\n\nZach Weissmueller of *Reason* magazine argued against an anti-capitalist interpretation of the series, saying that \"*Squid Game* isn't really about capitalism, properly understood. It's about developing strategies for undermining and resisting authoritarian control and retaining your humanity under a system designed to strip it all away.\"[201]\n\n\nAs the series was introduced ahead of the 2022 South Korean presidential election, several of the candidates began using some of the *Squid Game* imagery in their political ads and challenging opponents to similar games,[39] as well as using the themes of the series related to economic disparity as part of their political platform.[202] The Korean Confederation of Trade Unions used outfits and imagery based on *Squid Game* as part of its messaging and demonstrations against the current economic disparity in South Korea.[203] Closer to the election, the campaign had become drowned in more mudslinging, with the various candidates calling out others through insulting names and asserting that those that lost would be sent to jail, and as a result, the campaign period became known as the \"Squid Game Campaign\".[204] A North Korean state-run website, 'Arirang Meari', used *Squid Game* to critically mock the economic situation in South Korea, saying that it exposes the \"beastly\" nature of the \"South Korean capitalist society where mankind is annihilated by extreme competition\", and describes South Korea as a country where \"corruption and immoral scoundrels are commonplace\".[205][206] A diplomatic cable of the United States Department of State said, \"At the heart of the show's dark story is the frustration felt by the average Korean, and particularly Korean youth, who struggle to find employment, marriage, or upward mobility—proving that grim economic prospects are indeed at the center of Korean society's woes.\"[207]\n\n\n\n### Other commentary[edit]\n\n\nSeveral journalists observed that *Squid Game* effectively used foreshadowing in alluding to the deaths of the major characters and other elements of the series.[208] For example, Ali (Player 199) is shown in the second episode to be tricked by his employer out of his wages, while his death comes after he is tricked into giving Sang-woo his marbles in the sixth episode. Similarly, the gangster Deok-su (Player 101) evades a set-up by his underlings in the second episode by diving off a bridge, while his death in the game comes from the seventh episode Stepping Stones game when pulled to his death from the glass bridge by Mi-nyeo.[209] Sae-byeok has a scar on her neck and holds a knife to the neck of the man who swindled her out of her money; later her throat is slit by Sang-woo.[210] Several additional scenes in early episodes also were said to have hinted towards Il-nam (Player 001) being special and not just a normal player of the game, including being the only old person among the players, having the \"001\" player identification, and keen awareness of all the games since they were of his design.[211]\n\n\nThe series drew some criticism for its similarity to the 2014 Japanese film *As the Gods Will*. Like the manga upon which the film was based, *Squid Game* features dangerous versions of children's games such as Daruma-san ga koronda, the Japanese version of Red Light, Green Light. Responding to allegations of plagiarism, director Hwang Dong-hyuk stated that he had been working on the script since at least 2008 and that similarities between the two films, of which he had been made aware during the process of filming, were coincidental.[212][213] He acknowledged that he had been inspired by Japanese comics and animation, including *Battle Royale* and *Liar Game*.[38]\n\n\nSome bilingual viewers have debated the quality of Netflix's translations, observing that the English closed captioning, which was based on the English dub, changed the meaning of some dialogue when compared to the original Korean. Bilingual performers for the English dub acknowledged that there were some translation issues, and noted that this type of work is challenging due to limitations on how captioning can be presented to viewers.[214] Jinhyun Cho, a senior lecturer in translation at Macquarie University, stated that particularly in the Korean language, there are words that are \"untranslatable\" such as *aegyo*, as well as honorifics used in Korean culture. Because on-screen translations are limited to a small space, there is no room for translators to provide the necessary context for these words, and thus they are often left out or overly simplified, frequently so in the case of *Squid Game*. Cho gave the example of Sang-woo asking Ali to call him *hyung*, a Korean honorific term used to refer to one as an older brother or an older trusted friend, rather than the more formal *sajang-nim* (company president) that Ali had been using since they first met. However, due to the complexities of the meaning of *hyung*, the English translation simplified \"Call me *hyung*\" to just \"call me Sang-woo\", losing the implication of this request.[215] The quality of the subtitles of *Squid Game* opened debate about Netflix, and other services looking to expand their libraries with international works, to give more effort to the subtitles and closed captioning quality in order to better capture meaning of the original language.[216]\n\n\nThe show received some criticism for its portrayal of women.[217][218] Haeil, a feminist organisation in Korea, said that the show was \"neither a representation nor a criticism of the reality of anti-feminism in Korea\" and that it demonstrated an \"exclusively male gaze\".[219] The show was also found to highlight how migrant workers from other Asian countries (in the case of Ali's character being from Pakistan) are treated and at times exploited as second-class citizens within South Korea, though some found Ali's character to be too naïve to the realities of the situation and a caricature of such migrant workers within the country.[220][221]\n\n\n\n## Related works[edit]\n\n\n### Mockumentary[edit]\n\n\nHwang had also worked with Netflix to create a mockumentary inspired by *Squid Game*'s success, titled *The Best Show on the Planet*. Hwang said the comedy was based on his own personal experience of being pushed into the spotlight due to the rapid success of *Squid Game*.[222]\n\n\n\n### *Squid Game: The Challenge*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Squid Game: The Challenge\n\nNetflix announced a reality competition series, *Squid Game: The Challenge*, in June 2022 along with an open casting call. The ten-episode series will see 456 players competing for a US$4.56 million cash prize, with challenges based on those in the show.[223] Production is a joint work of Studio Lambert and The Garden. The filming started in early 2023 at Cardington Studios in Bedfordshire.[224]\n\n\nIn January 2023, reports emerged that ambulances had been called to treat real life injuries sustained while filming the show. Netflix denied the severity of the reports stating that the injuries were mild medical conditions and that they care about the health and safety of the cast and crew. The local ambulance service also stated that it had not been called out to the studios recently.[225][226] Britain's Health and Safety Executive evaluated the production after these complaints and found no actionable issues, though cautioned the production to be prepared for any future risks.[227]\n\n\nThe show is scheduled to premiere in November 2023.[228]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Battle royal\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** At the time of broadcast, ₩45.6 billion was approximately US$38 million or €33 million.\n2. **^** In an interview with *Vanity Fair*, Hwang revealed the original number of participants for the game in the original script was around 1000, but he later reduced the numbers due to budget issues. The amount of total prize money for the show was set similar to the largest amount of prize money ever given for lotteries in South Korea. Gi-hun was allocated the last number, 456, to reflect his social status in the show.[4]\n3. **^** Hwang Dong-Hyuk said the number was actually a pun using the fact that \"two-eighteen\" in Korean is *i-sibpal* (이십팔), similar to the Korean swear word *ssibal* (씨발, \"fucker\").[4]\n4. **^** *lit.* The day hibiscus bloomed. The English title references the game Red Light, Green Light. The Korean title references the Korean version of the game.\n5. **^** The title is a reference to the 1924 Korean novel with the same name that tells the story of a rickshaw man initially being happy earning a lot of money from having a lot of customers on a rainy day, and thrilled to buy his wife some soup, only to find his wife dead in her house.[30]\n6. **^** Following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 and as part of the financial crisis of 2007–2008, banks in South Korea had tried to help provide external investments to stabilize foreign currency rates. As the crisis worsened into 2009, these stabilization attempts had failed, causing a reversing of money from the country, and forcing banks to drastically increase interest rates and seek high-risk short-term loans made to citizens to try to recover.[33]\n7. **^** \"Blue paper, red paper\", also known by its Japanese name \"Akai-Kami-Aoi-Kami\", is an urban legend that started from japan that was later spread to South Korea. The legend is about a ghost that haunts the toilets and is known to ask the question, \"Do you want blue toilet paper or red toilet paper?\". Either option will result in the death of the person. Unlike the Korean versions, the ghost of the Japanese story has a name called \"Aka Manto\".\n8. **^** Hwang revealed that the music figures used for the project were the ones in the gas station where he wrote the script, and that they were playing \"Fly Me to the Moon\", and this is why he used the music for the show.[4]\n9. **^** One \"viewer\" is defined by Netflix as a subscriber having viewed any portion of a work longer than two minutes.[124]\n10. **^** The other five programs that had reached 3 billion minutes viewed in a week are *You*, *Tiger King*, *Ozark*, *The Umbrella Academy* and *The Crown*, all Netflix series.[133]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Squid Game: the smash-hit South Korean horror is a perfect fit for our dystopian mood\". *the Guardian*.

The first set of seven episodes was released on May 27, 2022, while the second set of two episodes was released on July 1, 2022. The season was produced by the show's creators the Duffer Brothers, along with Shawn Levy, Dan Cohen, Iain Paterson and Curtis Gwinn. \n\n\nReturning as series regulars are Winona Ryder, David Harbour, Millie Bobby Brown, Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin, Noah Schnapp, Sadie Sink, Natalia Dyer, Charlie Heaton, Joe Keery, Maya Hawke, Priah Ferguson, Matthew Modine and Paul Reiser, while Brett Gelman was promoted to series regular after recurring in the previous two seasons. Jamie Campbell Bower, Joseph Quinn, Eduardo Franco and Cara Buono also star. Tom Wlaschiha, Nikola Đuričko, Mason Dye, and Sherman Augustus appear in recurring roles. \n\n\n\nThe season was met with positive reviews, with critics praising the performances, the visuals, action sequences, realistic themes, soundtrack, emotional weight, and the darker, more mature tone, though some criticized it for being overstuffed due to the lengthier episode runtimes.[1][2][3] The first volume of the season received 13 nominations for the 74th Primetime Emmy Awards, including Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series, winning five.[4][5] \n\n\n## Premise[edit]\n\n\nSet in March 1986, eight months after the events of the third season, the fourth season is split between different plotlines. \n\n\nThe first plotline takes place in Hawkins, where a series of mysterious teenage murders begin haunting the town. Eddie Munson, leader of the Hellfire Club, Hawkins High School's Dungeons & Dragons group, becomes a prime suspect in the murders after senior cheerleading captain Chrissy Cunningham dies in his trailer. Dustin Henderson, Lucas and Erica Sinclair, Max Mayfield, Steve Harrington, Nancy Wheeler, and Robin Buckley begin investigating to clear Eddie's name. They discover that the true perpetrator is a powerful being who resides in the Upside Down, whom they later dub \"Vecna\".\n\n\nThe second plotline involves Mike Wheeler visiting Eleven, Will and Jonathan Byers at their new home in California. Due to the events in Hawkins and the imminent danger to her friends, Eleven goes with Dr. Sam Owens to a secret facility in Nevada to regain her powers, where she is reunited with Dr. Martin Brenner and forced to confront her past in Hawkins National Laboratory with the aid of an isolation tank. With the military searching for Eleven, Mike, Will, Jonathan, and new friend Argyle try to track her down first.\n\n\nThe third plotline follows Joyce Byers and Murray Bauman as they venture to Russia upon learning that Jim Hopper may still be alive. Meanwhile, Hopper is held in a Soviet prison camp in Kamchatka, where he and the other inmates are forced to battle a Demogorgon that the Russians have captured.\n\n\n\n## Cast and characters[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of *Stranger Things* characters\n\n### Main[edit]\n\n\n* Winona Ryder as Joyce Byers\n* David Harbour as Jim Hopper[6]\n* Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven / Jane Hopper\n\t+ Martie Blair as Young Eleven\n* Finn Wolfhard as Mike Wheeler\n* Gaten Matarazzo as Dustin Henderson\n* Caleb McLaughlin as Lucas Sinclair\n* Noah Schnapp as Will Byers\n* Sadie Sink as Max Mayfield\n\t+ Belle Henry as Young Max\n* Natalia Dyer as Nancy Wheeler\n* Charlie Heaton as Jonathan Byers\n* Joe Keery as Steve Harrington\n* Maya Hawke as Robin Buckley[7]\n* Brett Gelman as Murray Bauman[8]\n* Priah Ferguson as Erica Sinclair[9]\n* Matthew Modine as Martin Brenner[10]\n* Paul Reiser as Sam Owens[11]\n\n\n### Also starring[edit]\n\n\n* Jamie Campbell Bower as Vecna / Henry Creel / One\n\t+ Raphael Luce as Young Henry Creel\n* Cara Buono as Karen Wheeler\n* Eduardo Franco as Argyle\n* Joseph Quinn as Eddie Munson\n### Recurring[edit]\n\n\n* Joe Chrest as Ted Wheeler\n* Mason Dye as Jason Carver[12]\n* Tom Wlaschiha as Dmitri \"Enzo\" Antonov[*citation needed*]\n* Nikola Đuričko as Yuri Ismaylov[13]\n* Rob Morgan as Sheriff Powell\n* John Reynolds as Officer Callahan\n* Sherman Augustus as Lt.

In an interview with *Entertainment Weekly* that ran shortly after the third season's release, series creators Matt and Ross Duffer revealed the series' creative team had already met on several occasions to discuss the show's future.[16] On September 30, 2019, Netflix announced it had signed the Duffer Brothers for a new multi-year television and film deal that was reportedly worth nine figures.[17][18][19][20][21] To coincide with the production deal announcement, Netflix also announced the renewal of *Stranger Things* for a fourth season by releasing a brief, minute-long teaser on YouTube.[18][20][21][22]\n\n\n\n### Writing[edit]\n\n\nCommenting on the previous season's ending, Ross Duffer divulged the process of connecting story arcs between seasons:\n\n\n\n\n> We don't want to write ourselves in a corner so we try to have these early discussions with the writers just to make sure that we're setting ourselves up to go in the right direction. We don't know a lot, but we do know a lot of the big broad strokes. At the end of season two, we knew about Billy. We knew that the Russians were going to come in. We didn't know the mall and stuff, but again, we know these big broad strokes. That's sort of where we are in season four. We have the big broad strokes. It's just now about filling in those lines in the details. We're pretty excited about where it's potentially going to go. Again, like we said, it's going to feel very different than this season. But I think that's the right thing to do and I think it'll be exciting.[16]\n> \n> \n\n\nMatt Duffer indicated one of the plot's \"broad strokes\" is the main center of action being moved out of Hawkins, Indiana, for the majority of the season, a series first.[16] He also indicated the several loose ends left by the ending of season three, such as Hopper's perceived death and Eleven being adopted by Joyce Byers and relocating with her new family out of state, will all be explored sometime during the fourth season.[16] The Duffers later expanded on their previous comments, saying that \"epic\" triptych structure of the fourth season was one of the main contributing factors to its exaggerated length.[23] They likened it to the HBO series *Game of Thrones* in terms of its sheer scale, runtime, and newer, more mature tonal shift, as well as having split their characters across multiple distant locations.[23][24]\n\n\nAnother contributing factor to the show's newfound extended length was the expressed goal of the Duffers to finally provide answers to uncertainties regarding the series' long-simmering mythology, which they have been slowly revealing like \"layers of [an] onion\" over the past three seasons. Halfway through writing the fourth season, Matthew and Ross realized they were going to need a ninth episode to include all of their desired plot points, which Netflix in turn \"quickly approved\".[23] During production on the first season, the duo prepared a twenty-page document for Netflix that explained the show's universe, including what the Upside Down is, in clear detail. In turn, material from the document dictated certain plots while writing the season.[23] The Duffers wanted to spend more time within the Upside Down in this season, as the narrative of the third season gave them little opportunity to explore it further.[24]\n\n\nSince the fourth season is the longest-running season produced so far, the Duffers and Netflix opted for a two-volume release plan. In a letter from the Duffer Brothers posted by Netflix, the duo revealed they wrote nine scripts spanning over 800 pages, and that the fourth season is nearly double the length of any of the previously released seasons.[25]\n\n\nIn an interview on the Netflix podcast *Present Company with Krista Smith*, Ross Duffer discussed season four's much more mature tone, which he indicated will be at least partially achieved by \"[leaning] into\" the horror genre:\n\n\n\n\n> When we pitched it to Netflix all those years ago, we pitched it as the kids are... *The Goonies* in *E.T.* That's their storyline. And the adults are in *Jaws* and *Close Encounters* [sic] and then the teens are in *Nightmare on Elm Street* or *Halloween*. But, this year, we don't have the kids. We can't do *The Goonies* anymore. And so, suddenly, we're leaning much harder into that horror movie territory that we love. It was fun to make that change.[26]\n> \n> \n\n\nIn a May 2022 interview with *Entertainment Weekly* on their *Around the Table* series, Finn Wolfhard stated that this season feels like \"five movies into one\", comparing it to \"Scooby-Doo-meets-Zodiac-killer\" while also being a \"stoner action-comedy\" and a \"Russian prison movie\".[27]\n\n\nThe character of Eddie Munson is based on Damien Echols, one of the West Memphis Three who was wrongly convicted in 1994 of the deaths of three boys due to his appearance, which residents tied to being part of a satanic cult. The writers drew from *Paradise Lost*, a documentary covering Echols, for Eddie's story.[28]\n\n\nAs they had done with the Demogorgon from the first season, the Duffers opted to use the *Dungeons & Dragons* character of Vecna as the basis of this season's antagonist, something that the child characters would recognize and understand the dangers due to their familiarity through the role-playing game. While Vecna was not fully introduced in *Dungeons & Dragons* materials until 1990 through the module *Vecna Lives!*, and only had been alluded to in the lore prior to that, the Duffers believed that Eddie was an advanced gamemaster that was able to extrapolate how Vecna would behave for purposes of the show.[29]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\nBy November 1, 2019, casting had begun to add four new male characters to the fourth season's lineup, with three of the roles being teenagers and one of them being an adult.[30][31] The teenaged roles were characterized as ranging \"from a metalhead to an entitled jock to a character that sounds an awful lot like the twin of *Fast Times at Ridgemont High* stoner Jeff Spicoli\", while the adult character was tied to the Russian storyline introduced during the third season.[30]\n\n\nOn December 3, 2019, it was confirmed by the show's writers' room that Maya Hawke's character Robin would be returning for the fourth season.[7] On February 14, 2020, Netflix confirmed David Harbour would return as Jim Hopper and that Tom Wlaschiha had been cast as a Russian malefactor.[6][32] Priah Ferguson's return to the series was confirmed in February 2020.[9] That March, Brett Gelman's promotion to series regular was also confirmed.[8] On October 27, 2020, it was reported that Maya Hawke's brother, Levon Thurman-Hawke, was cast in an undisclosed role.[33]\n\n\nOn November 20, 2020, Jamie Campbell Bower, Eduardo Franco, and Joseph Quinn were cast as series regulars while Sherman Augustus, Mason Dye, Nikola Đuričko, and Robert Englund joined the cast in recurring roles for the fourth season;[12] Englund, best known for portraying Freddy Krueger in the *Nightmare on Elm Street* films, had approached the Duffers for a role in *Stranger Things*, which fit well with the direction they wanted to take this season.[24] On June 9, 2021, Amybeth McNulty, Myles Truitt, Regina Ting Chen, and Grace Van Dien joined the cast in recurring roles for the fourth season.[34]\n\n\nIn the case of Bower, he was initially announced as \"Peter Ballard\", and credits for his role in the first six episodes were listed as \"Friendly Orderly\". This was to hide the reveal that his character was the grown-up Henry Creel, who was the first test subject for Dr. Brenner and thus named \"One\", and that he would become Vecna following his battle with Eleven.[35][36]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Claremont House in Rome, Georgia was used for exterior shots of the Creel House.\nIn February 2020, it was announced in a joint statement from the Duffer Brothers and Netflix that production had officially begun on the fourth season[6] in Vilnius, Lithuania, at the recently decommissioned Lukiškės Prison[37][38] as well as Kyviskes airfield.[39]\nAfter production wrapped in Lithuania, filming resumed in the United States in and around the Atlanta metro area, the primary production location of previous seasons.[40][41] However, after two weeks of filming, all Netflix productions, including *Stranger Things*, were halted on March 16, 2020, due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.[42] A significant portion of filming occurred at Albuquerque Studios in New Mexico, which Netflix acquired in 2018.[43]\n\n\nAfter several delays, filming resumed on September 28, 2020, in Georgia.[44] On October 1, 2020, Natalia Dyer, Sadie Sink, and Gaten Matarazzo were all spotted filming scenes at the Hawkins Middle School and Hawkins High School sets.[45] The three were also spotted filming scenes at the set for Dustin's house the following day.[46] Filming took place in late 2020 around Rome, Georgia, including exterior shots of the Claremont House, which was used as the Creel House in the show.[47]\n\n\nOn January 27, 2021, Matthew Modine was spotted filming scenes in Atlanta.[48] On March 15, 2021, set photos were leaked of a trailer park in Griffin, Georgia that was dressed with tendrils from the Upside Down.[49] In June 2021, David Harbour said filming was set to wrap in August.[50] The same month, Joe Keery, Sadie Sink, Natalia Dyer, Maya Hawke, Priah Ferguson, and Caleb McLaughlin were spotted filming a scene that involved buying weapons from a store.[51] In August 2021, a fire with no injuries near one of the filming sets was reported.[52] In September 2021, Noah Schnapp stated that filming had wrapped.[53]\n\n\nTo visually distinguish between the season's three storylines, costume designer Amy Parris revealed that each of the plot's locations will have their own distinct color palette: \"It's so fun because [the production team gets] to kind of capture California versus Hawkins through color. So, Hawkins still looks very saturated. We don't have as much as the dusty, rusty brown of Seasons 1 or 2 ... And in California, we get to incorporate baby pinks, and fun teals and purples. It's way more sun-soaked and saturated as opposed to the richer colors of Hawkins.\"[54] American shoe company Converse designed three different styles of shoes using the Hawkins High School colors to be worn onscreen during a scene depicting a pep rally.[54]\n\n\nAccording to Bower, for the key scenes of the massacre at the Hawkins lab, Brown herself helped to direct Martie Blair, who played the younger version of Eleven, so that the multiple filmings of Eleven's interactions with Henry in the lab, some with Brown and some with Blair, were consistent in Eleven's mannerisms.[35]\n\n\n\n### Post-production[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2022, *The Wall Street Journal* reported in an article scrutinizing Netflix's recent production expenditures that the total cost to produce season four of *Stranger Things* was around $270 million, which amounts to roughly $30 million per episode.[55]\n\n\n\n### Visual effects[edit]\n\n\nDue to the season's considerable length, thousands of visual effect shots were commissioned and rendered during the two-year production and post-production processes.[25] However, the Duffers wanted to rely more on practical effects than computer-generated ones, similar to how the first season was produced. For example, the season's major threat from the Upside Down, a humanoid creature called Vecna, was \"90% practical\", which the Duffers found created a better presence on the set for the actors to respond to rather than a prop for later computer-generated effects.[24]\n\n\nBarrie Gower, a make-up artist that had worked previously on *Game of Thrones* and *Chernobyl*,[56] provided the look for Vecna and other creatures.[24] Vecna was loosely based on the *Dungeons & Dragons* villain of the same name, though the character in the universe of the show is a human \"who mutated into a monster from overexposure to the Upside Down ... he's been subjected to all the environments and all the surroundings of the Upside Down basically for 20 odd years.\"[57] Jamie Campbell Bower, who plays the human character that is turned into Vecna, also played the role of Vecna with the use of planned prosthetics.[35] Once the outfit was prepared, it took about seven hours of work to fit Bower into it.[35]\n\n\nGower designed Bower's Vecna costume with \"anemic\" skin whose integration with the toxic environment of the Upside Down was apparent through the inclusion of \"lot of roots and vines and very organic shapes and fibrous muscle tissue.\"[57] To achieve this look using mostly practical effects, Gower disclosed that he and his team took a full body cast of Bower, to later sculpt to meet their design needs:\n\n\n\n\n> We started off with his life cast, and to make sure everything was going to be super skin-tight, we reduced the life cast by a certain percentage all over, so once we had a plaster form of his entire body, our guys here started modeling the body in all shapes and forms in the Plasticine, which took several weeks to do that. From that, we split the body up into various sections... I think it was about 18 pieces in total, and they all went on to their own respective formers made out of either fiberglass or epoxy resin. And then we made molds of all the separate Plasticine pieces and then once we had these molds, we were able to create prosthetic appliances, and we've done them in a mixture of materials.[54]\n> \n> \n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nBefore and after comparison of visual effects work done by Rodeo FX.\n\nAs with season three, Montreal-based Rodeo FX was contracted to provide a number of visual effects for the fourth season. One of the most complicated shots they worked on tracked a demobat as it glided through the air towards the Creel house in the Upside Down. Due to its various complexities, the company reports the shot took two years to animate to completion.[58] To animate the death scenes of Vecna's cursed victims, personnel at Rodeo FX conducted \"extensive research on broken bones and accidents\" so they could properly manipulate the actor's CGI doubles to make their death look convincingly gruesome. The company also animated the demogorgon and demodogs seen in the Kamchatka prison, and updated their designs to better compliment the brighter lighting of the setting that was not present in seasons one and two.[58]\n\n\nThe season was released while the visual effects team were still perfecting the special effects, due to challenges encountered during the COVID-19 pandemic. Production went eight weeks over schedule for the season, without a change to the release date. The amount of visual effects work required for the season during a limited time period led Netflix to bring over some visual effects editors working on other shows they produced to devote more resources to this season.[59] The Duffer brothers said that they updated certain visual effects shots in the season's first volume during its initial release weekend, a practice Netflix has not allowed for any of its past releases.[60] Similarly with volume two, a number of visual effects shots had finished rendering the morning of June 30, a day before the release. The season finale was originally uploaded with an estimated 20 unfinished visual effects shots to meet the release deadline.[61] In all, season four's two-and-a-half hour finale had more visual effects shots than the entirety of season three.[62] Three weeks after the season's release, the visual effects team was still updating visual effects shots at the request of the Duffer brothers.[59]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: *Stranger Things 4* (soundtrack) and *Stranger Things: Music from the Netflix Original Series, Season 4*\n\nBoth volumes of the original soundtrack album for the fourth season, titled *Stranger Things 4*, were released digitally on July 1, 2022, via Lakeshore and Invada Records.[63][64] Like the previous three seasons, the soundtrack was composed by Kyle Dixon and Michael Stein of the electronic band Survive. Both volumes were also released on physical formats such as CD and vinyl.[63][64]\n\n\nThe non-original soundtrack companion album for the season, titled *Stranger Things: Music from the Netflix Original Series, Season 4*, was released digitally in two volumes by Legacy Recordings on May 27 and July 1, respectively.[65]\n\n\nKate Bush's \"Running Up That Hill\" is featured multiple times during the season, including as part of the key scene in episode 4 with Max escaping from Vecna. The Duffers had envisioned a powerful emotional song for Max and had tasked music supervisor Nora Felder to determine which song would be used. Felder came upon \"Running Up That Hill\", which the Duffers agreed was a great fit for both the music itself and the theme of dealing with God. Winona Ryder also mentioned in an interview that she had been dropping hints to include the singer since the first season, arriving on sets in her Kate Bush T-shirts. Felder knew that Bush had been cautious on music licensing before, but after contacting her, Felder learned Bush was a fan of the show, and after reviewing the script pages where the song would be used, Bush agreed to clear licensing rights to the song for the show.[66][67] The song saw a resurgence of popularity with an increase of over 8,700% on streaming charts, reaching the second-most heard song on Spotify playlists in the United States and the fourth-most song for worldwide charts.[68] Metallica's \"Master of Puppets\" was prominently featured in the season finale when Eddie played its guitar riffs and solo as music to lure and distract demobats in the Upside Down. The song also got a significant boost peaking at number one on streaming platforms,[69] and made listings on music charts in both the U.S. and UK for the first time since the song's original release in 1986.[70]\n\n\nOther songs featured in the season, such as Dead or Alive's \"You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)\", Musical Youth's \"Pass the Dutchie\", and Falco's \"Rock Me Amadeus\", also saw increased streaming playbacks of around 1,784 percent.[68] The final two episodes of the season featured period music and classic rock songs such as Siouxsie and the Banshees' \"Spellbound\", James Taylor‘s \"Fire and Rain\", Rick Derringer’s \"Rock and Roll, Hoochie Koo\" and Journey's \"Separate Ways (Worlds Apart)\".[71]\n\n\n\n### Marketing[edit]\n\n\nThe season's official announcement showed a ticking grandfather clock in the Upside Down and ended with the tagline \"We're not in Hawkins anymore,\" which led many news outlets to speculate the show's setting would be relocated to Russia.[18][20][21][22] A teaser was released on February 14, 2020, showing that Hopper was still alive.[6] On October 2, 2020, the show's various social media accounts posted two photographs from different sets: A poster for a pep rally hanging in a hallway at Hawkins High, and a clapperboard in front of a grandfather clock in the Upside Down, a scene that was first depicted in the season's initial teaser trailer.[72] A second teaser was released on May 6, 2021.[73]\n\n\nOn August 6, 2021, a sneak peek was released featuring most of the core cast and announcing that the show would return in 2022.[74] On September 25, 2021, a third teaser was released, showcasing the house that was previously owned by the Creel family.[75] The final teaser was released on November 6, 2021, and showed inside Will's and Eleven's lives in California, with the episode titles for the season being revealed on that same day.[76]\n\n\nOn February 17, 2022, the social media accounts associated with *Stranger Things* released four teaser posters, one to coincide with the four teasers that were previously released, and a fifth poster, announcing the release date of both volumes.[77] On March 23, 2022, Netflix released various stills from the upcoming fourth season.[78] On April 12, 2022, the first official trailer was released online.[79] On May 20, 2022, the first eight minutes of the season's first episode were released online.[80][81]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\nThe fourth season was released on the streaming platform Netflix in two volumes, the first volume with seven episodes was released on May 27, 2022, while the second volume with two episodes was released five weeks later on July 1, 2022.[82]\n\n\nThe season's release occurred three days after a mass school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, where a gunman fatally shot 21 people. In the aftermath of the tragedy, and considering that the first episode's cold open — a scene that had been released as an online tease one week before the premiere[83] — features graphic images of dead bodies including those of children's, Netflix added a warning card before the prior season recap that automatically plays before the episode. The card, which is shown only to viewers in the United States, reads as follows:\n\n\n\n\n> \"We filmed this season of *Stranger Things* a year ago. But given the recent tragic shooting at a school in Texas, viewers may find the opening scene of episode 1 distressing. We are deeply saddened by this unspeakable violence, and our hearts go out to every family mourning a loved one.”[84]\n> \n> \n\n\nShortly after the season's release, viewers reported that Will's friends did not acknowledge his birthday in an episode of the season that took place on that day. The Duffers said in an interview that they could rectify the matter by changing its month, which they called \"George Lucas-ing the situation\", in reference to the canon changes that George Lucas had made to the original *Star Wars* trilogy to match what the prequel trilogy had added.[60][85] Some viewers took this to imply that scenes from earlier seasons were also being edited, including one scene where Jonathan takes discreet pictures of a pool party that Steve, Nancy, and Barbara are holding. The writers stated that \"no scenes from previous seasons have ever been cut or re-edited\", including this scene.[85]\n\n\nOn July 1, 2022, after the second volume of the season was released, Netflix's website reportedly crashed due to server overload as vast numbers of users logged on to stream the new episodes, overwhelming the service.[86][87][88][89]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Viewership[edit]\n\n\nNetflix reported that by May 30, 2022, *Stranger Things 4* had been viewed more than 287 million hours, surpassing the previous first-week viewership record from season two of *Bridgerton*, which had 193 million hours in its first week. Earlier seasons of *Stranger Things* also broke into the top 10 viewed programs in the same week as *Stranger Things 4*'s release.[90] With its fourth season, *Stranger Things* became the second Netflix title to reach more than one billion hours viewed within its first 28 days of release, following *Squid Game*. It reached 1.352 billion hours of viewership in the first 28 days, making it the second-most viewed program after *Squid Game*, and the most viewed English-language series ever.[91][92][93]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the fourth season holds an approval rating of 88% based on 193 reviews with an average rating of 7.9/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Darker and denser than its predecessors, *Stranger Things*' fourth chapter sets the stage for the show's final season in typically binge-worthy fashion.[94] On Metacritic, the fourth season's first volume has a score of 69 out of 100, based on 29 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\";[95] the second volume has a score of 74 out of 100, based on 18 reviews, also indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[96]\n\n\nReviewing for *The A.V. Club*, Saloni Gajjar gave the season a \"B+\" and said, \"*Stranger Things* still injects an enthralling backstory into its well-established universe. It’s an indication that the final two episodes of Volume 2 (dropping on July 1), despite its movie length, will only elevate season four.\"[97] *The Guardian*'s Jack Seale gave it a 4 out of 5 stars and summarized it by saying, \"*Stranger Things* is bigger, older, somewhat sadder – and as lovable as ever.\"[1] Tilly Pearce of *Digital Spy* also rated it a 4 out of 5 stars and said \"*Stranger Things* continues to be the beautifully addictive nostalgic thrill ride we know and love. Season four is without a doubt the strongest offering to date and by far the most ambitious.\"[98]\n\n\nTara Bennett from *Paste* gave it a score of 8.1 out of 10 and wrote, \"There’s a lot to love about *Stranger Things* Season 4, especially when it comes to some of the character progression and the change in vibe which fully embraces the tropes of the best of ‘80s horror.\"[99] In a mixed review, Mae Trumata of *The Upcoming* gave it a 3/5 stars and said \"Overall, this is a fun continuation to *Stranger Things*. For anyone who’s well acquainted and attached to the series and the characters, this is an addition that will either be appreciated or tired of, as it offers nothing significantly new.\"[100] Author Stephen King reviewed the season as \"as good or better than the previous three\", pointing out a \"*Carrie* riff\". However, King opined that the decision to split the season into two parts is \"kind of lame\".[101] Sophie Gilbert of *The Atlantic* was more critical, calling the season \"a 13-hour-plus behemoth that added Wes Craven to its mood board but otherwise ended with undeveloped characters and obvious but superficial allusions to contemporary crises.\"[102]\n\n\nCritics praised Jamie Campbell Bower's performance as the season's villain. Patrick Caoile of *Collider* said \"For the first time, *Stranger Things* gives us a villain with layers. Through Vecna, Bower explores a compelling, more complicated villain than the monsters that came before. From his traumatic childhood as Henry Creel to the abusive experiments he went through as One and finally to his role as the Mind Flayer’s top general, Vecna is the perfect villain to pit against Eleven.[103] Another *Collider* writer Robert Brian Taylor stated, \"He's a compelling presence from the moment he first appears. [...] From there his performance continues to shape-shift -- from intriguing to imposing to menacing,\" and called his monologue scene in episode seven as \"hypnotizing\" and further deemed the scene as \"*Stranger Things* at its best.\"[104] *Vulture'*s Devon Ivie wrote, \"[Bower] has the distinction of embodying three characters, each more unsettling than the last, as the episodes unfurl: a friendly Hawkins Laboratory orderly; Henry Creel, aka \"One\"; and the most significant villain of the series thus far, Vecna.\"[105]\n\n\n*TVLine* named Joseph Quinn the \"Performer of the Week\" on May 28, 2022, for his performance in the episode \"Chapter One: The Hellfire Club\", writing: \"Quinn took the teenager in short order from curious to concerned, then from panicked to so utterly horrified that he let out the kind of shriek that other shrieks hear and go, “Whoa.” All in all, Quinn’s debut was as auspicious as they come.\"[106] Caleb McLaughlin was also named the \"Performer of the Week\" on July 9, 2022 for his performance in the season's final episode \"Chapter Nine: The Piggyback\". The site wrote: \"...after Vecna’s brutal assault of Max, McLaughlin unleashed Lucas' pain with a rawness and urgency that still haunts us. McLaughlin had just shown us what an empowered young man his alter ego had become.\"[107]\n\n\n*TVLine* gave Sadie Sink an honorable mention on June 4, 2022 for her performance in the episode \"Chapter Four: Dear Billy\", writing: \"Sink not only nailed the tasks [of Max trying to put on a brave face for her friends despite being anxious and afraid] while still maintaining the edge that her character had received upon enrollment in the school of hard knocks, she also played Max's bittersweet monologue to her late stepbrother with a mixture of sincerity and regret that all but defined the word 'heartbreaking'.\"[108] Millie Bobby Brown was also an honorable mention on July 2, 2022 for her performance in the penultimate episode \"Chapter Eight: Papa\". The site wrote: \"Brown unleashed a pain and fury that was every bit as impressive as her character's powers. Later, when 'Jane' was offered a chance to rewrite history, in a manner of speaking, Brown beautifully, wordlessly played the emotions that were roiling inside of her alter ego. The scene was complex, deep and tricky to navigate, especially without any dialogue on her part. Yet Brown led us through it as surely as a lantern through a dark night.\"[109]\n\n\nThe season was listed as one of the best TV shows of 2022, with *BuddyTV* and *PopBuzz* placing it at number one.[110][111] *Entertainment.ie* ranked it at number five,[112] *NME* at number eight,[113] *ScreenCrush* at number 10,[114] and *Empire* at number 11.[115] In addition, *Nerdist* included it in its unranked list.[116]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of awards and nominations received by *Stranger Things*\n\n#### Awards and nominations[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Award\n | Category\n | Nominee(s)\n | Result\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2022\n | Hollywood Critics Association TV Awards | Best Streaming Series, Drama\n | *Stranger Things* | Nominated\n | [117] |\n| Best Actress in a Streaming Series, Drama\n | Winona Ryder | Nominated\n |\n| Best Supporting Actor in a Streaming Series, Drama\n | Joe Keery | Nominated\n |\n| Best Supporting Actress in a Streaming Series, Drama\n | Millie Bobby Brown | Nominated\n |\n| Maya Hawke | Nominated\n |\n| Sadie Sink | Won\n |\n| Best Directing in a Streaming Series, Drama\n | The Duffer Brothers (for \"Chapter Seven: The Massacre At Hawkins Lab\") | Nominated\n |\n| Shawn Levy (for \"Chapter Four: Dear Billy\") | Nominated\n |\n| Best Writing in a Streaming Series, Drama\n | The Duffer Brothers (for \"Chapter Seven: The Massacre At Hawkins Lab\") | Nominated\n |\n| Location Managers Guild Awards | Outstanding Locations in Period Television\n | Tony Holley, Kyle A.

Created by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, it stars Jenna Ortega as the titular character, with Gwendoline Christie, Riki Lindhome, Jamie McShane, Hunter Doohan, Percy Hynes White, Emma Myers, Joy Sunday, Georgie Farmer, Naomi J. Ogawa, Christina Ricci, and Moosa Mostafa appearing in supporting roles. Four out of the eight episodes of the first season were directed by Tim Burton, who also serves as executive producer. It revolves around Wednesday Addams, who attempts to solve a murder mystery at her new school.[2]\n\n\nBurton was previously approached to direct the 1991 film *The Addams Family* and was involved with a cancelled stop-motion animated *The Addams Family* film. In October 2020, he was reported to be helming a television series, which was later given a series order by Netflix. Ortega was cast in part to represent the character's Latina heritage. Ricci, who had played the titular character in the 1991 film and its 1993 sequel *Addams Family Values*, was asked by Burton to join the series in a supporting role. Filming took place in Romania between September 2021 and March 2022.\n\n\n*Wednesday* premiered on November 16, 2022, and was released on Netflix on November 23 to predominantly positive reviews from critics, who praised Ortega's performance.[3] Within three weeks of release, it became the second-most watched English-language Netflix series. It received two Golden Globe nominations: Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy and Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy for Ortega. It also received Primetime Emmy nominations for Outstanding Comedy Series and Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series. In January 2023, the series was renewed for a second season.\n\n\n\n\n## Premise[edit]\n\n\nWednesday Addams is expelled from her school after dumping live piranhas into the school's pool in retaliation for the boys' water polo team bullying her brother Pugsley. Consequently, her parents Gomez and Morticia Addams enroll her at their high school alma mater Nevermore Academy, a private school for monstrous outcasts, in the town of Jericho, Vermont. Wednesday's cold, emotionless personality and her defiant nature make it difficult for her to connect with her schoolmates and cause her to run afoul of the school's principal Larissa Weems. However, she discovers she has inherited her mother's psychic abilities, which allow her to solve a local murder mystery.\n\n\n\n## Cast and characters[edit]\n\n\n### Main[edit]\n\n\n* Jenna Ortega as Wednesday Addams, a teenager who possesses psychic powers.

She sees a psychic vision of his bullies, whom she then attempts to kill, resulting in her expulsion. Her parents, Morticia and Gomez, decide to enroll her in Nevermore Academy, their alma mater and a school for outcasts in Jericho, Vermont. Meanwhile, a hiker is killed by an unknown creature near Nevermore. Wednesday's parents release Thing, a sentient disembodied hand, to watch over her. She meets her roommate Enid, her complete opposite, and duels with Bianca, the popular girl, after Bianca bullies a boy named Rowan. Later, Wednesday is nearly killed by a falling gargoyle but is saved by Bianca's ex-boyfriend, Xavier. After escaping her court-ordered therapy session, Wednesday meets Tyler, a coffee barista who agrees to help her escape from Nevermore. However, she is apprehended by Principal Larissa Weems and taken back to the school. Later, Tyler and Wednesday meet at the local carnival, and Wednesday has a vision of Rowan's death. Rowan attempts to kill her but is murdered by the monster.\n |\n| 2 | 2 | \"Woe Is the Loneliest Number\" | Tim Burton | Alfred Gough & Miles Millar | November 23, 2022 (2022-11-23) |\n| Wednesday convinces a skeptical Sheriff Galpin that the perpetrator of the murders is in fact a monster. Suddenly, Rowan reappears unharmed. Wednesday doubts her sanity and decides to investigate the murders herself. She roams the campus inquiring about Rowan and is told that he has been expelled. Meanwhile, Weems grows worried about Wednesday's visions, keeping close tabs on her. Wednesday confronts a defensive Rowan as he leaves the school and sends Thing to follow him. Thing loses him and Rowan is revealed to be Principal Weems, who has shapeshifted into him. Wednesday has visions of a book belonging to an old students' society. In her search for the book, she overhears Bianca planning to rig the upcoming student tournament. Wednesday joins Enid to defeat Bianca and win the tournament. Later, Wednesday discovers a hidden library within the school, where she is captured.\n |\n| 3 | 3 | \"Friend or Woe\" | Tim Burton | Kayla Alpert | November 23, 2022 (2022-11-23) |\n| Wednesday finds herself tied up and surrounded by members of an elite students' society, including Bianca and Xavier. Wednesday frees herself and leaves the library, taking one of the books with her. Weems orders Wednesday to play in the school's band at an upcoming town ceremony run by Mayor Noble Walker. A drawing in the book leads her to an exhibition at a local fair, where she notices the painting of a girl she had seen in her visions. In the forest, Wednesday envisions the girl—believed to be an ancestor of hers—ready to be executed by Joseph Crackstone, the town's founder who is intent on killing all outcasts, but the girl is able to escape. Wednesday is ambushed by the monster, which she discovers to be human. Back in town, Wednesday crashes the ceremony by having Thing destroy a commemorative statue of Joseph Crackstone and is scolded by Principal Weems. While investigating a crime scene in the forest, police find a camera that captured photographs of the monster.\n |\n| 4 | 4 | \"Woe What a Night\" | Tim Burton | Kayla Alpert | November 23, 2022 (2022-11-23) |\n| Wednesday and Thing break into the coroner's office to copy the files of the monster's victims. In trying to identify a pattern, she finds that each victim has had body parts surgically removed. Wednesday becomes suspicious of Xavier and follows him into his art studio, where she discovers several drawings of the monster, which lead her to the monster's lair. There, she retrieves one of its claws and gives it to Sheriff Galpin for DNA matching. Wednesday and Tyler attend a school dance together. Meanwhile, classmate Eugene, who is privy to Wednesday's investigative work, witnesses a cloaked figure blow up the monster's cave. The dance is interrupted by Mayor Walker's son, Lucas, who triggers the building's fire sprinklers in revenge for Wednesday's disruption of the town ceremony. Wednesday senses that Eugene is in danger and heads into the forest, only to find him gravely injured by the monster.\n |\n| 5 | 5 | \"You Reap What You Woe\" | Gandja Monteiro | April Blair | November 23, 2022 (2022-11-23) |\n| 32 years earlier, Gomez Addams was arrested at Nevermore on suspicion of killing Garrett Gates, a descendant of Joseph Crackstone. In present time, the Addamses visit Wednesday on Parents' Weekend at Nevermore. A family therapy session is cut short when Wednesday confronts her parents about the suspected murder. Meanwhile, Sheriff Galpin learns that the coroner committed suicide after admitting to fabricating Gates's autopsy report. Galpin concludes that Gomez is guilty and arrests him. In prison, Gomez reveals to Wednesday that he was covering for Morticia, who actually killed Gates. Wednesday and Morticia dig up Gates's grave to find that he had been lethally poisoned before he was killed, but are caught by police and arrested for the night. Later, they confront Mayor Walker, who reveals that Garrett intended to poison the entire school due to his father's hate for outcasts. Mayor Walker agrees to release Gomez after admitting to covering up Gates's motive. Back at Nevermore, Principal Weems reluctantly admits to covering up Rowan's death by means of shapeshifting in an effort to evade controversy at the school.\n |\n| 6 | 6 | \"Quid Pro Woe\" | Gandja Monteiro | April Blair | November 23, 2022 (2022-11-23) |\n| Wednesday attempts to summon Goody, an ancestor and fellow psychic who killed Crackstone. During a surprise birthday party, Wednesday has a vision of Goody, who instructs her to seek out the Gates mansion. There, she witnesses Mayor Walker as he is leaving the building and sneaks into his car. After arriving back in town, Mayor Walker is hit by a car and severely injured. Principal Weems locks down the school and forbids Wednesday to leave campus. With Tyler and Enid's help, she escapes and returns to the Gates mansion. There, they discover that Laurel Gates, Garrett's younger sister, long believed to be dead, might still be alive. They find the severed body parts of the monster's victims in a cellar, but are forced to flee after being ambushed by the monster. Wednesday leads Galpin to the cellar, only to find it empty. At Nevermore, Wednesday convinces Weems not to expel her in order to further pursue her investigation. At the hospital, an unknown figure kills Mayor Walker.\n |\n| 7 | 7 | \"If You Don't Woe Me by Now\" | James Marshall | Alfred Gough & Miles Millar and Matt Lambert | November 23, 2022 (2022-11-23) |\n| At Mayor Walker's funeral, Wednesday notices a lurking figure and chases it into the forest. The figure is revealed to be Uncle Fester, who explains to Wednesday that the monster she has been investigating is a Hyde. Together, they retrieve a diary from the hidden library which reveals that a Hyde must always have a master. Later, they track and follow Xavier, who they witness meeting up with Dr. Kinbott, Wednesday's therapist, in the forest. After returning from a date with Tyler, Wednesday finds her dorm room vandalized, the diary stolen, and Thing gravely injured. Research into Laurel Gates reveals that she is both alive and the master of the Hyde. Wednesday initially suspects Dr. Kinbott, but Kinbott is killed by the Hyde. Police arrive to arrest Xavier, who Wednesday believes to be the Hyde. Wednesday meets with Tyler and kisses him but suddenly has a vision of him being the Hyde and runs off.\n |\n| 8 | 8 | \"A Murder of Woes\" | James Marshall | Alfred Gough & Miles Millar | November 23, 2022 (2022-11-23) |\n| Wednesday and her classmates kidnap Tyler, and Wednesday tortures him to try to make him confess. Disagreeing with her methods, her classmates alert Principal Weems, and Wednesday is arrested. At the police station, Tyler secretly confesses to Wednesday that he is the monster. Fed up with Wednesday's behavior, Weems expels her from Nevermore. Wednesday visits Eugene at the hospital, whose description of the figure he saw at the monster's cave matches Ms. Thornhill, a teacher at Nevermore. Weems, disguised as Tyler, and Wednesday get Thornhill to confess that she is Laurel Gates and manipulated Tyler into killing the victims as part of her scheme to resurrect Joseph Crackstone and wipe out all outcasts. However, Gates kills Weems and subdues Wednesday. Using Wednesday's blood, Gates resurrects Crackstone and leaves Wednesday to die, but Goody appears and heals her. Enid, having transformed into her werewolf form, defeats Tyler in his Hyde form while Crackstone breaches Nevermore. With help from Bianca, Wednesday destroys Crackstone, and Eugene helps defeat Gates. Xavier is released from prison, Tyler is detained, and Wednesday departs Nevermore, which is closing for the remainder of the semester.\n |\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\nDuring pre-production on *The Addams Family* (1991), Tim Burton was approached to direct, but ended up passing on it due to scheduling conflicts with *Batman* and *Batman Returns*, resulting in Barry Sonnenfeld taking the job.[6][7] In March 2010, it was announced that Illumination Entertainment had acquired the underlying rights to the Addams Family drawings.[8] The film was planned to be a stop-motion animated film based on Charles Addams's original drawings. Burton was set to co-write, co-produce, and possibly direct the film.[9] In July 2013, it was reported that the film was cancelled,[10] which, according to Burton, was due to the studio favoring a computer-animated approach over the stop-motion technique.[11]\n\n\nShowrunners Miles Millar and Alfred Gough started developing story ideas in 2019. They subsequently acquired the rights to the intellectual property before writing a pilot script, which they sent to Burton.[12] To their surprise, Burton immediately became interested upon receiving the script.[13] Commenting about his decision to join the project, Burton stated that he could relate to the titular character's worldview and that the script \"spoke to me about how I felt in school and how you feel about your parents, how you feel as a person. It gave the Addams Family a different kind of reality. It was an interesting combination.\"[11] Millar stated that it was \"very important\" to the creative team not to emulate the prior films and 1964 television series.[13] Millar and Gough decided to make the juxtaposition of \"outcasts\" and \"normies\", as well as criticism of colonial Americans, major themes in the series.[14]\n\n\nIn October 2020, *Wednesday* was initially announced as an unnamed *Addams Family* project being helmed by Burton. The series's production would be handled by Amazon MGM Television, with Burton as director. Gough and Millar would serve as showrunners, while Gough, Millar, and Burton would also be executive producers alongside Gail Berman, Jon Glickman, and Andrew Mittman.[15] In February 2021, Netflix gave the production a series order consisting of eight episodes.[16] In August 2021, Kayla Alpert was added as an executive producer and 1.21, Tee and Charles Addams Foundation, and Glickmania were also producing the series.[17] Deemed his \"first real foray into television\", Burton directed four out of the eight episodes,[13] with Gandja Monteiro and James Marshall directing the remaining episodes.[18] Burton brought on regular collaborator Colleen Atwood as costume designer.[13]\n\n\nOn possible future seasons, Gough and Millar commented in an interview with *Variety*, \"when we sit down to create a show, it's looking at multiple seasons, ideally. That's never expected, but that's the anticipation that hopefully the show is successful.\" They further stated that they had \"a pretty clear runway\" of how future seasons could unfold.[19] In an interview with *The Hollywood Reporter*, Gough and Millar stated that the second season would expand upon the friendship between Wednesday and Enid while also evolving Wednesday's relationship with her mother, Morticia.[20] Ortega stated that the season would \"lean into the horror aspect\" while \"ditching any romantic love interest for Wednesday\".[21] Preparations for a second season commenced in December 2022, following Amazon's acquisition of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.[22] In January 2023, the series was renewed for a second season,[23] with Ortega now also serving as producer.[24]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\n![Christina Ricci](image)\n![Jenna Ortega](image)\nChristina Ricci (left) appears in the series as a nod to her previous portrayal of the titular character, this time played by Jenna Ortega (right).[25]\n\nThe creative team sought a Latina to play the role of Wednesday Addams in order to align with character Gomez Addams's heritage, an aspect of the character that was already worked into the series' script.[26] In May 2021, Jenna Ortega, who is of Mexican and Puerto Rican descent,[26] was cast in the role.[27] Millar stated that, upon their first Zoom call together, the creative team knew that \"nobody else on this planet\" was better suited to portray the character.[28] Ortega said that she was initially hesitant about joining the project due to her past work in teen-oriented Disney Channel shows[29] and her plans to prioritize film over television work, but decided to join in after meeting Burton through Zoom.[30] In the beginning of August of that year, Luis Guzmán was cast to guest-star as Gomez Addams,[17] and Catherine Zeta-Jones was cast as Morticia Addams in an undisclosed capacity.[31] Later that month, Thora Birch, Riki Lindhome, Jamie McShane, Hunter Doohan, Georgie Farmer, Moosa Mostafa, Emma Myers, Naomi J. Ogawa, Joy Sunday, and Percy Hynes White were announced to be cast as series regulars.[32] Myers initially auditioned for the titular role before she was cast as Wednesday's roommate Enid.[33]\n\n\nIn September, Gwendoline Christie and Victor Dorobantu were added to the cast in starring roles while Isaac Ordonez, George Burcea, Tommie Earl Jenkins, Iman Marson, William Houston, Luyanda Unati Lewis-Nyawo, Oliver Watson, Calum Ross, and Johnna Dias Watson were cast in recurring roles.[34] In December 2021, Birch left the series, leaving the status of her character, dorm mother Tamara Novak, unclear.[35] In March 2022, it was announced that Christina Ricci, who played Wednesday Addams in the film *The Addams Family* and its 1993 sequel *Addams Family Values*, was cast as a series regular, replacing Birch in a similar role.[36] Commenting on her casting, Ricci stated, \"I was really flattered to be asked and to be asked by Tim [Burton]\",[25] with whom she had previously collaborated on the 1999 film *Sleepy Hollow*.[37] Ricci was almost unable to accept the role due to possible scheduling conflicts with Showtime series *Yellowjackets*.[26] In October, a trailer revealed Fred Armisen to be portraying Uncle Fester, and Ricci's role was confirmed as Marilyn Thornhill.[38]\n\n\nTo prepare for her role, Ortega learned to play cello and took canoeing, fencing, archery, and German lessons.[28] According to actress Joy Sunday, the canoeing lessons were especially strenuous, involving the entire cast and some dozen stuntmen racing each other for an hour daily, with days starting as early as 5:30 am.[39] Ortega avoided talking to Ricci about playing the character during filming in order to achieve her own unique rendition of the role.[40] She choreographed her dance to the Cramps' \"Goo Goo Muck\" herself, taking inspiration from Siouxsie Sioux, Bob Fosse, and goth dance club footage from the 1980s.[41][42] Ortega sought to make Wednesday's characterization consistent, down to changing lines that she felt were unfitting of the character, and with more depth. She stated \"you can't lead a story and have no emotional arc because then it's boring and nobody likes you.\"[43][30] Scenes featuring Thing, played by Romanian magician Victor Dorobantu, were achieved using a mixture of practical and special effects; Dorobantu wore a blue chroma-key bodysuit that would be edited out in post-production, leaving only his hand exposed. To create the illusion of a severed hand, a prosthetic stump was applied to Dorobantu's hand.[44]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The entrance to the Cantacuzino Castle as of April 2023 has been marketed as the shooting location of *Nevermore Academy*\nFilming of Series 1 took place between September 2021 and March 2022 in the Southern Carpathian town of Bușteni, Romania.[45][46] Filming locations included Cantacuzino Castle, serving as the setting for the fictional Nevermore Academy, Politehnica University of Bucharest, Sinaia railway station, the Bucharest Botanical Garden, Monteoru House, and the historic Olga Greceanu Mansion in Dâmbovița County, standing in for the Gates mansion.[47] Exterior shots of Cantacuzino Castle were supplemented with computer-generated imagery.[48] Other settings, including the entire town of Jericho, were constructed at Buftea Studios.[47][49] Production designer Mark Scruton based his set design primarily on Charles Addams's original cartoons and drew inspiration from Burton-directed films such as *Beetlejuice* and *Charlie and the Chocolate Factory*.[50] Ortega called her work on the series \"very stressful and confusing\" and \"the most overwhelming job I've ever had\" due to the production's fast-tracked shooting schedule.[30][51]\n\n\nSeries 2 will be filmed in Ireland, with filming scheduled to begin in April 2024.[52][53][54][55]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2021, it was reported that longtime Burton collaborator Danny Elfman joined the series to compose the original theme[56] and co-compose its score with Chris Bacon.[18] The score features a selection of the series's original score composed by Elfman and Bacon as well as several pop songs, including cello renditions of \"Paint It Black\"[57] by the Rolling Stones, \"Nothing Else Matters\" by Metallica, and \"Physical\" by Dua Lipa.[58][59] The score also incorporates a number of classical works, including *The Four Seasons* by Antonio Vivaldi, Edward Elgar's Cello Concerto, *The Carnival of the Animals* by Camille Saint-Saëns, *Gnossienne* No. 1 by Erik Satie, and \"Flight of the Bumblebee\" by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov.[60]\n\n\nLed by two singles,[61] *Wednesday*'s 48-track soundtrack was released by Lakeshore Records on November 23, 2022,[58] and a four-track extended play featuring covers of classical and pop songs was released on November 30.[60] In his review of the series, Tony Sokol of *Den of Geek* called the score \"a major character, not only thematically, but as an emotional delivery system\", making \"the chills creepier, the jokes funnier, and the tingles tangible\".[62] Linda Codega of *Gizmodo* called the cello segments \"memorable\" and the score \"occasionally-magnificent\".[63] Writing for *IGN*, Amelia Emberwing described the combination of Elfman's score with Burton's material as \"[going] together like peanut butter and jelly\" and the score overall as \"a stunner\".[64]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jenna Ortega and Luis Guzmán promoting the show at the 2022 New York Comic Con.\nA first teaser trailer for *Wednesday* was released on August 17, 2022,[65] followed by a full trailer on October 9[66] and the unveiling of the series' opening sequence on November 8.[67] *Wednesday* premiered on November 16, 2022, at Hollywood Legion Theater in Los Angeles.[68][69] Its eight episodes were released on Netflix on November 23, 2022.[70] In December 2022, Netflix released a promotional video to its Twitter account depicting Thing, a sentient disembodied hand appearing in the series, roaming the streets of New York City and capturing the reactions of passersby.[71]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Audience viewership[edit]\n\n\nAccording to data from users of TV Time collected by Whip Media, *Wednesday* had the second-most pre-release followers of any Netflix original series on the platform, behind only *The Witcher*;[72] it ultimately debuted at number one on Netflix in 83 countries.[73] The series holds the record of most hours viewed in a week for an English-language Netflix series with a total 341 million hours watched in its first week of release, amounting to more than 50 million households, and passing prior record holder *Stranger Things 4*'s 335 million hours.[74] Nielsen Media Research reported a combined watch time of 6 billion minutes within its first week of release, making it the second-biggest streaming week ever recorded by the firm.[75] Three weeks after its release, it became the second-most watched English-language Netflix series in the history of the platform, reaching an estimated 150 million households and totaling 1 billion viewing hours.[76] Jacob Stolworthy of *The Independent* called the series's popularity \"unprecedented\" and suggested that it could jumpstart development of several other spin-off television series.[77]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 71% approval rating and an average rating of 6.8/10, based on 98 reviews. The website's critics consensus reads, \"*Wednesday* isn't exactly full of woe for viewers, but without Jenna Ortega in the lead, this *Addams Family*-adjacent series might as well be another CW drama.\"[78] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 66 out of 100 based on 26 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[79]\n\n\nEd Power of *The Daily Telegraph* gave *Wednesday* four out of five stars and called it \"an addictively rococo romp that unfolds like a cross between *Euphoria* and *Hotel Transylvania*\".[80] John Anderson of *The Wall Street Journal* commended Ortega's \"charismatic performance\" and called the series \"often delightful, despite its deliberate darkness\".[81] In his \"B\"-review for *The Detroit News*, Tom Long deemed the series visually appealing and described Ortega's deadpan as \"just as elastic as it needed to be\" and her performance overall as \"consistently [pushing] outside the caricature enough to keep things lively\".[82] Writing for *RogerEbert.com*, Cristina Escobar similarly praised Ortega's deadpan humor and commended the series' \"satisfactory\" ending.[83] While finding that the series would not be \"what real fans of Charles Addams and his characters are looking for\", Mike Hale of *The New York Times* called the series \"tolerable\" despite \"satisfying only on the level of formulaic teenage romance and mystery\" and compared it to the *Harry Potter* franchise.[84] Commenting on its tone, Jesse Hassenger of *TheWrap* described the four episodes directed by Burton as feeling more like *Veronica Mars* than *Sleepy Hollow*.[85] Nick Hilton of *The Independent* gave the series two out of five stars and criticized the series's tone as \"relentlessly quippy Gen Z\" and its performances as \"more two-dimensional than the *New Yorker* comic strip in which the characters first appeared\".[86]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\n\n\nAccolades received by *Wednesday*\n| Award\n | Year\n | Category\n | Recipient(s)\n | Result\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| AACTA International Awards | 2023 | Best Comedy Series\n | *Wednesday* | Nominated\n | [87][88] |\n| Art Directors Guild Awards | 2023 | Excellence in Production Design for a One-Hour Period or Fantasy Single-Camera Series | Mark Scruton (for \"Woe is the Loneliest Number\") | Nominated\n | [89] |\n| British Academy Television Awards | 2023 | Best International Programme | *Wednesday* | Nominated\n | [90] |\n| British Academy Television Craft Awards | 2023 | Best Make Up and Hair Design | Tara McDonald\n | Nominated\n | [91][92] |\n| Critics' Choice Super Awards | 2023 | Best Horror Series | *Wednesday* | Won\n | [93] |\n| Best Actress in a Horror Series\n | Jenna Ortega | Won\n |\n| Christina Ricci | Nominated\n |\n| Costume Designers Guild Awards | 2023 | Excellence in Contemporary Television | Colleen Atwood and Mark Sutherland (for \"Wednesday's Child is Full of Woe\") | Won\n | [94] |\n| Directors Guild of America Awards | 2023 | Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Comedy Series | Tim Burton (for \"Wednesday's Child is Full of Woe\") | Nominated\n | [95] |\n| Golden Globe Awards | 2023 | Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy | *Wednesday* | Nominated\n | [96] |\n| Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy | Jenna Ortega\n | Nominated\n |\n| Golden Reel Awards | 2023 | Outstanding Achievement in Music Editing – Broadcast Long Form | Michael T.

According to *Billboard*, on-demand streams of the song in the United States increased from 2,500 to over 134,000,[118] and Spotify streams increased by 9,500 percent since the series was released.[119] Janelle Zara of *The Guardian* stated that the viral dance trend \"may have single-handedly revived Gothic subculture for Gen Z\".[120]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Andreeva, Nellie (February 17, 2021). \"Wednesday Addams Live-Action Series From Tim Burton Ordered By Netflix; Al Gough & Miles Millar To Showrun\". *Deadline Hollywood*.

The series traces two long-prepared heists led by the Professor (Álvaro Morte), one on the Royal Mint of Spain, and one on the Bank of Spain, told from the perspective of one of the robbers, Tokyo (Úrsula Corberó). The narrative is told in a real-time-like fashion and relies on flashbacks, time-jumps, hidden character motivations, and an unreliable narrator for complexity.\n\n\nThe series was initially intended as a limited series to be told in two parts. It had its original run of 15 episodes on Spanish network Antena 3 from 2 May 2017 through 23 November 2017. Netflix acquired global streaming rights in late 2017. It re-cut the series into 22 shorter episodes and released them worldwide, beginning with the first part on 20 December 2017, followed by the second part on 6 April 2018. In April 2018, Netflix renewed the series with a significantly increased budget for 16 new episodes total. Part 3, with eight episodes, was released on 19 July 2019. Part 4, also with eight episodes, was released on 3 April 2020. A documentary involving the producers and the cast premiered on Netflix the same day, titled *Money Heist: The Phenomenon* (Spanish: *La casa de papel: El Fenómeno*). In July 2020, Netflix renewed the show for a fifth and final part, which was released in two five-episode volumes on 3 September and 3 December 2021, respectively.\n\n\nSimilar to *Money Heist: The Phenomenon*, a two-part documentary involving the producers and cast premiered on Netflix the same day, titled *Money Heist: From Tokyo to Berlin*. The series was filmed in Madrid, Spain. Significant portions were also filmed in Panama, Thailand, Italy (Florence), Denmark and in Portugal (Lisbon). A South Korean remake set in an alternate universe, *Money Heist: Korea – Joint Economic Area*, was released on 24 June 2022, while a direct spin-off, *Berlin*, with Pedro Alonso reprising his role, is in active development, forming a shared universe.[2]\n\n\nThe series received several awards including the International Emmy Award for Best Drama Series at the 46th International Emmy Awards, as well as critical acclaim for its sophisticated plot, interpersonal dramas, direction, and for trying to innovate Spanish television. The Italian anti-fascist song \"Bella ciao\", which plays multiple times throughout the series, became a summer hit across Europe in 2018. By 2018, the series was the most-watched non-English-language series and one of the most-watched series overall on Netflix,[3] having particular resonance with viewers from Mediterranean Europe and the Latin American regions.\n\n\n\n\n## Premise[edit]\n\n\nSet in Madrid, a mysterious man known as the \"Professor\" recruits a group of eight people, who choose city names as their aliases, to carry out an ambitious plan that involves entering the Royal Mint of Spain, and escaping with €984 million. After taking 67 people hostage inside the Mint, the team plans to remain inside for 11 days to print the money as they deal with elite police forces. In the events following the initial heist, the group's members are forced out of hiding and prepare for a second heist, with some additional members, this time aiming to escape with gold from the Bank of Spain, as they again deal with hostages and police forces.\n\n\n\n## Cast and characters[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Money Heist cast members\n\n### Main[edit]\n\n\n* Úrsula Corberó as Silene Oliveira (Tokyo): a runaway turned robber who is scouted by the Professor, then joins his group and participates in his plans.

we wanted to cross lines we couldn't cross in previous projects, in terms of narrative and structure without any intermediaries.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—Writer Esther Martinez Lobato, October 2018[10]\n\nThe series was conceived by screenwriter Álex Pina and director Jesús Colmenar during their years of collaboration since 2008.[11] After finishing their work on the Spanish prison drama *Locked Up* (*Vis a vis*), they left Globomedia to set up their own production company, named Vancouver Media, in 2016.[11][12] For their first project, they considered either filming a comedy or developing a heist story for television,[11] with the latter having never been attempted before on Spanish television.[13] Along with former *Locked Up* colleagues,[d] they developed *Money Heist* as a passion project to try new things without outside interference.[10] Pina was firm about making it a limited series, feeling that dilution had become a problem for his previous productions.[14]\n\n\nInitially entitled *Los Desahuciados* (*The Evicted*) in the conception phase,[14] the series was developed to subvert heist conventions and combine elements of the action genre, thrillers and surrealism, while still being credible.[11] Pina saw an advantage over typical heist films in that character development could span a considerably longer narrative arc.[15] Characters were to be shown from multiple sides to break the viewers' preconceptions of villainy and retain their interest throughout the show.[15] Key aspects of the planned storyline were written down at the beginning,[16] while the finer story beats were developed incrementally to not overwhelm the writers.[17] Writer Javier Gómez Santander compared the writing process to the Professor's way of thinking, \"going around, writing down options, consulting engineers whom you cannot tell why you ask them that,\" but noted that fiction allowed the police to be written dumber when necessary.[17]\n\n\nThe beginning of filming was set for January 2017,[13] allowing for five months of pre-production.[18] The narrative was split into two parts for financial considerations.[18] The robbers' city-based code names, which Spanish newspaper *ABC* compared to the colour-based code names in Quentin Tarantino's 1992 heist film *Reservoir Dogs*,[19] were chosen at random in the first part,[20] although places with high viewership resonance were also taken into account for the new robbers' code names in part 3.[21] The first five lines of the pilot script took a month to write,[18] as the writers were unable to make the Professor or Moscow work as narrator.[14] Ultimately, Tokyo was chosen as an unreliable narrator. Flashbacks and time-jumps increased the narrative complexity[15] and made the story more fluid for the audience.[18] The pilot episode required over 50 script versions until the producers were satisfied.[22][23] Later scripts would be finished once per week to keep up with filming.[18]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\nCasting took place late in February 2016, spanning more than two months.[24] The characters were not fully fleshed out at the beginning of this process, and took shape based on the actors' performances.[25] Casting directors Eva Leira and Yolanda Serrano were looking for actors with the ability to play empathetic robbers with believable love and family connections.[26] Antena 3 announced the ensemble cast in March 2017[27] and released audition excerpts of most cast actors in the series' aftershow *Tercer Grado* and on their website.[25]\n\n\nThe Professor was designed as a charismatic yet shy villain who could convince the robbers to follow him and make the audience sympathetic to the robbers' resistance against the powerful banks.[28] However, developing the Professor's role proved difficult, as the character did not follow archetypal conventions[24] and the producers were uncertain about his degree of brilliance.[14] While the producers found his Salva personality early on,[14] they were originally looking for a 50-year-old Harvard professor type with the looks of Spanish actor José Coronado.[14][29] The role was proposed to Javier Gutiérrez, but he was already committed to starring in the film *Campeones*.[30] Meanwhile, the casting directors advocated for Álvaro Morte, whom they knew from their collaboration on the long-running Spanish soap opera *El secreto de Puente Viejo*, even though his prime-time television experience was limited at that point.[29] Going through the full casting process and approaching the role through external analysis rather than personal experience, Morte described the professor as \"a tremendous box of surprises\" that \"end up shaping this character because he never ceases to generate uncertainty,\" making it unclear for the audience if the character is good or bad.[24] The producers also found that his appearance of a primary school teacher gave the character more credibility.[14]\n\n\nPedro Alonso was cast to play Berlin, whom *La Voz de Galicia* would later characterize as a \"cold, hypnotic, sophisticated and disturbing character, an inveterate macho with serious empathy problems, a white-collar thief who despises his colleagues and considers them inferior.\"[31] The actor's portrayal of the character was inspired by a chance encounter Alonso had the day before receiving his audition script, with \"an intelligent person\" who was \"provocative or even manipulative\" to him.[32] Alonso saw high observation skills and an unusual understanding of his surroundings in Berlin, resulting in unconventional and unpredictable character behaviour.[31] Similarities between Berlin and Najwa Nimri's character Zulema in Pina's TV series *Locked Up* were unintentional.[33] The family connection between the Professor and Berlin was not in the original script, but was built into the characters' backstory at the end of part 1 after Morte and Alonso had repeatedly proposed to do so.[34]\n\n\nThe producers found the protagonist and narrator, Tokyo, among the hardest characters to develop,[18] as they were originally looking for an older actress to play the character who had nothing to lose before meeting the Professor.[25] Úrsula Corberó eventually landed the role for bringing a playful energy to the table; her voice was heavily factored in during casting, as she was the first voice the audience hears in the show.[25] Jaime Lorente developed Denver's hallmark laughter during the casting process.[25] Two cast actors had appeared in previous TV series by Álex Pina: Paco Tous (Moscow) had starred in the 2005 TV series *Los hombres de Paco*, and Alba Flores (Nairobi) had starred in *Locked Up*. Flores was asked to play Nairobi without audition when Pina realised late in the conception phase that the show needed another female gang member.[14] For the role opposite to the robbers, Itziar Ituño was cast to play Inspector Raquel Murillo, whom Ituño described as a \"strong and powerful woman in a world of men, but also sensitive in her private life\".[35] She took inspiration from *The Silence of the Lambs* character Clarice Starling, an FBI student with a messy family life who develops sympathies for a criminal.[36]\n\n\nThe actors learned of the show's renewal by Netflix before the producers contacted them to return.[37] In October 2018, Netflix announced the cast of part 3; the returning main cast included Pedro Alonso, raising speculation about his role in part 3.[38] Among the new cast members were Argentine actor Rodrigo de la Serna, who saw a possible connection between his character's name and the Argentine football legend Martín Palermo,[39] and *Locked Up* star Najwa Nimri. Cameo scenes of Brazilian football star, and fan of the series, Neymar, as a monk were filmed for part 3, but were excluded from the stream without repercussions to the narrative until judicial charges against him had been dropped in late August 2019.[40][17] A small appearance by Spanish actress Belén Cuesta in two episodes of part 3 raised fan and media speculation about her role in part 4.[41]\n\n\n\n### Design[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Spanish Surrealist painter Salvador Dalí was chosen as the heist team's mask design.\nThe show's look and atmosphere were developed by creator Álex Pina, director Jesús Colmenar, and director of photography Migue Amoedo, according to *La Vanguardia* \"the most prolific television trio in recent years\".[42] Abdón Alcañiz served as art director.[43] Their collaboration projects usually take a primary colour as a basis;[43] *Money Heist* had red as \"one of the distinguishing features of the series\"[44] that stood over the gray sets.[45] Blue, green and yellow were marked as a forbidden colour in production design.[45] To achieve \"absolute film quality\", red tones were tested with different types of fabrics, textures and lighting.[46] The iconography of the robbers' red jumpsuits mirrored the yellow prison dress code in *Locked Up*.[44] For part 3, the Italian retail clothing company Diesel modified the red jumpsuits to better fit the body and launched a clothing line inspired by the series.[45] Salvador Dalí was chosen as the robbers' mask design because of Dalí's recognisable visage that also serves as an iconic cultural reference to Spain; Don Quixote as an alternative mask design was discarded.[47] This choice sparked criticism by the Gala-Salvador Dalí Foundation for not requesting the necessary permissions.[26]\n\n\nTo make the plot more realistic, the producers requested and received advice from the national police, civil guard, and the Spanish Ministry of Interior.[48][49] The robbers' banknotes were printed with permission of the Bank of Spain and had an increased size as an anti-counterfeit measure.[48] The greater financial backing of Netflix for part 3 allowed for the build of over 50 sets across five basic filming locations world-wide.[50] Preparing a remote and uninhabited island in Panama to represent a robber hide-out proved difficult, as it needed to be cleaned, secured and built on, and involved hours-long travelling with material transportation.[46] The real Bank of Spain was unavailable for visiting and filming for security reasons, so the producers recreated the Bank on a two-level stage by their own imagining, taking inspiration from Spanish architecture of the Francisco Franco era.[46] Publicly available information was used to make the Bank's main hall set similar to the real location. The other interior sets were inspired by different periods and artificially aged to accentuate the building's history.[50] Bronze and granite sculptures and motifs from the Valle de los Caídos were recreated for the interior,[46] and over 50 paintings were painted for the Bank to emulate the Ateneo de Madrid.[50]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Spanish National Research Council headquarters, the principal filming location of part 1 and 2 of *Money Heist*\n![](image)The Nuevos Ministerios, the principal filming location of part 3 of *Money Heist*\nParts 1 and 2 were filmed back-to-back in the greater Madrid region from January until August 2017.[22][24][51] The pilot episode was recorded in 26 days,[48] while all other episodes had around 14 filming days.[15] Production was split into two units to save time, with one unit shooting scenes involving the Professor and the police, and the other filming scenes with the robbers.[18] The main storyline is set in the Royal Mint of Spain in Madrid, but the exterior scenes were filmed at the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) headquarters for its passing resemblance to the Mint,[48] and on the roof of the Higher Technical School of Aeronautical Engineers, part of the Technical University of Madrid.[51] The hunting estate where the robbers plan their coup was filmed at the Finca El Gasco farm estate in Torrelodones.[51] Interior filming took place at the former *Locked Up* sets in Colmenar Viejo[12] and at the Spanish national daily newspaper *ABC* in Torrejón de Ardoz for printing press scenes.[22] As the show was designed as a limited series, all sets were destroyed once production of part 2 had finished.[18]\n\n\nParts 3 and 4 were also filmed back-to-back,[52] with 21 to 23 filming days per episode.[15] Netflix announced the start of filming on 25 October 2018,[28] and filming of part 4 ended in August 2019.[53] In 2018, Netflix had opened their first European production hub in Tres Cantos near Madrid for new and existing Netflix productions;[54] main filming moved there onto a set three times the size of the set used for parts 1 and 2.[55] The main storyline is set in the Bank of Spain in Madrid, but the exterior was filmed at the Ministry of Development complex Nuevos Ministerios.[55] A scene where money is dropped from the sky was filmed at Callao Square.[51] Ermita de San Frutos in Carrascal del Río served as the exterior of the Italian monastery where the robbers plan the heist.[45] The motorhome scenes of the Professor and Lisbon were filmed at the deserted Las Salinas beaches in Almería to make the audience feel that the characters are safe from the police although their exact location is undisclosed at first.[56] Underwater scenes inside the vault were filmed at Pinewood Studios in the United Kingdom.[21][57] The beginning of part 3 was also filmed in Thailand, on the Guna Yala islands in Panama, and in Florence, Italy,[46] which helped to counter the claustrophobic feeling of the first two parts,[15] but was also an expression of the plot's global repercussions.[58] Filming for the fifth and final season concluded on 14 May 2021.[59]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Money Heist (soundtrack)\n\nThe series' theme song, \"My Life Is Going On,\" was composed by Manel Santisteban, who also served as composer on *Locked Up*. Santisteban approached Spanish singer, Cecilia Krull, to write and perform the lyrics, which are about having confidence in one's abilities and the future.[60] The theme song is played behind a title sequence featuring paper models of major settings from the series.[60] Krull's main source of inspiration was the character Tokyo in the first episode of the series, when the Professor offers her a way out of a desperate moment.[61] The lyrics are in English as the language that came naturally to Krull at the time of writing.[61]\n\n\nThe Italian anti-fascist song \"Bella ciao\" plays multiple times throughout the series and accompanies two emblematic key scenes: at the end of the first part the Professor and Berlin sing it in preparation for the heist, embracing themselves as resistance against the establishment,[62] and in the second part it plays during the thieves' escape from the Mint, as a metaphor for freedom.[63] Regarding the use of the song, Tokyo recounts in one of her narrations, \"The life of the Professor revolved around a single idea: Resistance. His grandfather, who had fought against the fascists in Italy, taught him the song, and he taught us.\"[63] The song was brought to the show by writer Javier Gómez Santander. He had listened to \"Bella ciao\" at home to cheer him up, as he had grown frustrated for not finding a suitable song for the middle of part 1.[17] He was aware of the song's meaning and history and felt it represented positive values.[17] \"Bella ciao\" became a summer hit in Europe in 2018, mostly due to the popularity of the series and not the song's grave themes.[62]\n\n\n\n## Episodes[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Money Heist episodes\n\nOverview of *Money Heist* seasons| Part[a] | Season[a] | Episodes | Originally released |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| First released | Last released | Network |\n| 1 | 1 | 9[e] | 2 May 2017 (2017-05-02) | 27 June 2017 (2017-06-27) | Antena 3 |\n| 2 | 6[e] | 16 October 2017 (2017-10-16) | 23 November 2017 (2017-11-23) |\n| 3 | 2 | 8 | 19 July 2019 (2019-07-19) | Netflix |\n| 4 | 8 | 3 April 2020 (2020-04-03) |\n| 5 | 3 | 10 | 5 | 3 September 2021 (2021-09-03) |\n| 5 | 3 December 2021 (2021-12-03) |\n\n### Season 1: Parts 1 and 2 (2017)[edit]\n\n\nPart 1 begins with the aftermath of a failed bank robbery by a woman using the alias \"Tokyo\" as a man called the \"Professor\" saves her from being caught by the police. He proposes to include her in a heist of massive proportions. After a brief outline of the plan, the story jumps to the beginning of a multi-day assault on the Royal Mint of Spain in Madrid. The eight robbers are code-named for cities: Tokyo, Moscow, Berlin, Nairobi, Rio, Denver, Helsinki, and Oslo. Dressed in red jumpsuits and masks depicting artist Salvador Dalí, the robbers take 67 hostages as part of their plan to print and escape with €2.4 billion through a self-built escape tunnel. The Professor heads the heist from an external location. Flashbacks throughout the series show the five months of preparation at an abandoned hunting estate in the Toledo countryside; the robbers are not to share personal information nor engage in personal relationships, and are warned that there will be casualties.\n\n\nThroughout parts 1 and 2, the robbers inside the Mint have difficulties sticking to their roles and face uncooperative hostages, violence, isolation, and mutiny. Tokyo narrates events through voice-overs. While Denver pursues a love affair with hostage Mónica Gaztambide, inspector Raquel Murillo of the National Police Corps negotiates with the Professor on the outside and begins an intimate relationship with his alter ego \"Salva.\" The Professor's identity is repeatedly close to being uncovered and Raquel eventually realizes Salva is the Professor, but she is emotionally unable to hand him over to the police. At the end of part 2, after 128 hours, the robbers escape from the Mint with €984 million, but Oslo, Moscow and Berlin are killed. One year after the heist, Raquel finds a series of postcards left by the Professor, who wrote the coordinates for a location in Palawan in the Philippines, where she reunites with him.\n\n\n\n### Season 2: Parts 3 and 4 (2019–2020)[edit]\n\n\nPart 3 begins three years after the heist on the Royal Mint of Spain, showing the robbers enjoying their lives paired-up in diverse locations. However, when Europol captures Rio with an intercepted phone, the Professor picks up Berlin's old plans to assault the Bank of Spain to force Europol to hand over Rio to prevent his torture. He and Raquel (going by \"Lisbon\") get the gang, including Mónica (going by \"Stockholm\"), back together, and enlist three new members: Palermo, Bogotá and Marseille, with Palermo in charge. Flashbacks to the Professor and Berlin outline the planned new heist and their different approaches to love. The disguised robbers sneak into the heavily guarded bank, take hostages and eventually gain access to the gold and state secrets. At the same time, the Professor and Lisbon travel in an RV and then an ambulance while communicating with the robbers and the police. The robbers thwart a police breach of the bank, forcing the police, led by Colonel Luis Tamayo and pregnant inspector Alicia Sierra, to release Rio to the robbers. Nairobi is injured by a police sniper's shot to the chest. With another police assault on the bank coming, and believing Lisbon has been executed by the police, the Professor radios Palermo and declares DEFCON 2. The robbers respond by firing a rocket at the armored police vehicle that is advancing on the bank, turning the robbers from folk heroes to killers in the eyes of the public. Part 3 concludes by showing Lisbon alive and in custody, and Tokyo narrating that the Professor had fallen for a trap. She concludes that because of the Professor's miscalculation, \"the war had begun.\"\n\n\nPart 4 begins with the robbers rushing to save Nairobi's life. While Tokyo stages a coup d'état and takes over command from Palermo, the Professor and Marseille deduce that Lisbon must still be alive and being interrogated by Sierra in the police command post tent outside the bank. They persuade Tamayo's assistant, Antoñanzas, to help them so the Professor can establish a 48-hour truce with the police. As the group manages to save Nairobi's life, the restrained Palermo attempts to reassert command by colluding with Gandía, the restrained chief of security for the Bank of Spain. Gandía escapes, begins communications with the police from within a panic room inside the bank, and participates in a violent cat-and-mouse game with the gang. Palermo reverses course, regains the trust of the group, and rejoins them. Gandía shoots Nairobi in the head, killing her instantly, but the gang later recapture him. As the police prepare another assault on the bank, the Professor exposes to the public the unlawful torture of Rio and Lisbon's detention and interrogation. Sierra is fired and begins pursuing the Professor on her own. The Professor enlists external help to free Lisbon after she is transferred from the command post tent to the Supreme Court building. Part 4 concludes with Lisbon rejoining the gang inside the bank, and with Sierra finding the Professor's hideout, then holding him at gunpoint.\n\n\n\n### Season 3: Part 5 Volumes 1 and 2 (2021)[edit]\n\n\nPart 5 Volume 1 begins with Sierra finding the Professor and knocking him out, then tying him up and interrogating him. After Lisbon enters the bank, the gang prepares for an attack by troops of the Spanish army. The gang captures Gandia, then frees him rather than killing him. Gandia wants to exact revenge on the gang, so Tamayo has him join the assault by the soldiers. After finding out the Professor has been caught but that Sierra has not notified the police, Lisbon tells the gang they will not give up. Benjamin and Marseille find the Professor, and Sierra knocks them out and ties them up. When Sierra struggles to deliver her baby, she frees the Professor, Marseille, and Benjamin so they can help. Sierra gives birth to a daughter, whom she names Victoria. Arturo Roman, a hostage in both the Royal Mint and the Bank of Spain, had an affair with Stockholm before the first heist, and Arturo's reminders anger Denver. When Arturo, the governor of the bank, and other hostages start a rebellion, Stockholm shoots Arturo, who is released so he can receive medical care. In a flashback, Berlin convinces his son Rafael to help him steal 12 kilograms of gold with Tatiana, Bogota, and Marseille. In the present, the gang starts fighting the soldiers, with Helsinki sustaining a severe injury. Stockholm feels guilt over shooting Arturo, who is her son's birth father, and takes morphine while nursing Helsinki, which leaves her unable to aid in the gang's defense against the attacking soldiers. Part 5 Volume 1 concludes with Tokyo sacrificing herself to defeat Gandia and the soldiers.\n\n\nIn Part 5 Volume 2, Sierra runs away and the Professor and Marseille chase after her. Initially enemies, the Professor and Sierra soon become allies as they face their common enemy – the police. When they go back to the stormwater tank, they see the gold has already been delivered to them by the gang. However, the police find the stormwater tank and arrests the Professor, Sierra, Benjamin and Marseille. They escape, but find the gold missing. It is revealed that the gold is stolen by Rafael and Tatiana because she broke up with Berlin in the past to be with Rafael. In the present, Tatiana and Rafael bury the gold. Palermo and the Professor discover that it is their doing, but at this time, the army captured the gang. The Professor gives Sierra a note for Rafael, and convinces her to find the gold as that is their only hope while he drives to the bank. When he enters the bank, Tamayo taunts him and interrogates each gang member separately. Denver goes first, but does not reveal anything and is escorted to the police tent. The gang reveals to the public the gold has already been removed from the bank, leading to public panic and an economic meltdown, putting Spain in danger of bankruptcy. Sierra is able to locate the stolen gold. Outside the bank, the gold has arrived in trucks, but the Professor says it is gold-coated brass. The gang members are killed on Tamayo's orders, shocking Denver in the tent. They are taken out of the bank in body bags, and it is revealed they are alive as the Professor convinced Tamayo to stop the chase; the return of the \"gold\" has stabilized the country's economy. 24 hours after the heist, the gang reunite at an air base. Everyone receives new passports as Rafael and Tatiana return the gold to the gang with a promise that they will receive a share. The gang leaves the air base, having successfully robbed the Bank of Spain.\n\n\n\n## Themes and analysis[edit]\n\n\nThe series was noted for its subversions of the heist genre. While heist films are usually told with a rational male Anglo-centric focus, the series reframes the heist story by giving it a strong Spanish identity and telling it from a female perspective through Tokyo.[66] The producers regarded the cultural identity as an important part of the personality of the series, as it made the story more relatable for viewers.[21] They also avoided adapting the series to international tastes,[21] which helped to set it apart from the usual American TV series[67] and raised international awareness of Spanish sensibilities.[21] Emotional dynamics like the passion and impulsivity of friendship and love offset the perfect strategic crime for increased tension.[52][66] Nearly all main characters, including the relationship-opposing Professor, eventually succumb to love,[58] for which the series received comparisons to telenovelas.[3][68] Comedic elements, which were compared to *Back to the Future*[24] and black comedy,[55] also offset the heist tension.[69] The heist film formula is subverted by the heist starting straight after the opening credits instead of lingering on how the gang is brought together.[70]\n\n\nWith the series being set after the financial crisis of 2007–2008, which resulted in severe austerity measures in Spain,[68] critics argued that the series was an explicit allegory of rebellion against capitalism,[3][71] including *The Globe and Mail*, who saw the series as \"subversive in that it's about a heist for the people. It's revenge against a government.\"[68] According to *Le Monde*, the Professor's teaching scenes in the Toledo hunting estate, in particular, highlighted how people should seek to develop their own solutions for the fallible capitalist system.[71] The show's Robin Hood analogy of robbing the rich and giving to the poor received various interpretations. *El Español* argued that the analogy made it easier for viewers to connect with the show, as modern society tended to be tired of banks and politics already,[67] and the *New Statesman* said the rich were no longer stolen from but undermined at their roots.[3] On the other hand, *Esquire*'s Mireia Mullor saw the Robin Hood analogy as a mere distraction strategy for the robbers, as they initially did not plan to use the money from their first heist to improve the quality of life of regular people; for this reason, Mullor also argues that the large following for the robbers in part 3 was not understandable even though they represented a channel for the discontent of those bearing economic and political injustices.[72]\n\n\nThe characters were designed as multi-dimensional and complementary antagonists and antiheroes whose moralities are ever-changing.[18] Examples include Berlin, who shifts from a robber mistreating hostages, to one of the series' most beloved characters.[18] There is also the hostage Mónica Gaztambide, as well as inspector Raquel Murillo, who eventually join the cause of the robbers.[18] Gonzálvez of *The Huffington Post* finds that an audience may think of the robbers as evil at first for committing a crime, but as the series progresses it marks the financial system as the true evil and suggests the robbers have ethical and empathetic justification for stealing from an overpowered thief.[73] Najwa Nimri, playing inspector Sierra in part 3, said that \"the complex thing about a villain is giving him humanity. That's where everyone gets alarmed when you have to prove that a villain also has a heart\". She added that the amount of information and technology that surrounds us is allowing us to verify that \"everyone has a dark side.\"[73] The series leaves it to the audience to decide who is good or bad, as characters are \"relatable and immoral\" at various points in the story.[18] Pina argued that it was this ability to change the view that made the series addictive and marked its success.[18]\n\n\nWith the relative number of female main characters in TV shows generally on the rise,[18] the series gives female characters the same attention as men, which the BBC regarded as an innovation for Spanish television.[74] While many plot lines in the heist series still relate to males,[18] the female characters become increasingly aware of gender-related issues, such as Mónica arguing in part 3 that women, just like men, could be robbers and a good parent.[75] Critics further examined feminist themes and a rejection of machismo[75] in the series through Nairobi and her phrase \"The matriarchy begins\" in part 2,[76] and a comparative scene in part 3, where Palermo claims a patriarchy in a moment that, according to CNET, is played for laughs.[77] *La Vanguardia* challenged any female-empowering claims in the series, as Úrsula Corberó (Tokyo) was often shown scantily clad,[78] and *Esquire* criticized how characters' relationship problems in part 3 were often portrayed to be the women's fault.[72] Alba Flores (Nairobi) saw no inherent feminist plot in the series, as women only take control when it suits the story,[76] whilst Esther Acebo (Mónica) described any feminist subtext in the show as not being vindicative.[79]\n\n\n\n## Broadcast and release [edit]\n\n\n### Original broadcast[edit]\n\n\n**Viewers per episode (millions)**\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

Netflix put it in that pile of series that it has, which is like the sock drawer that you never look in and from which only the algorithm can rescue you, and we didn't think it was a big deal.\"\n> \n> *Sin promoción ni nada. Netflix la metió en ese montón de series que tiene, que es como el cajón de los calcetines que nunca miras y de donde sólo te puede rescatar el algoritmo, y no le dimos ninguna importancia.*\n> \n> \n\n\n—Writer Javier Gómez Santander, September 2019[17]\n\nWithout a dedicated Netflix marketing campaign,[47] the series became the most-watched non-English language series on Netflix in early 2018, within four months of being added to the platform, to the creators' surprise.[3][89] This prompted Netflix to sign a global exclusive overall deal with Pina shortly afterwards.[90] Diego Ávalos, director of original content for Netflix in Europe, noted that the series was atypical in being watched across many different profile groups.[91] Common explanations for the drastic differences in viewership between Antena 3 and Netflix were changed consumption habits of series viewers[17][84] and the binge-watching potential of streaming.[42][84] Some people in Spain also only became aware of the series from Netflix, unaware of its original Antena 3 broadcast.[84] Pina and Sonia Martínez of Antena 3 would also later say that the series, with its high demand of viewer attention, unknowingly followed the video-on-demand format from the beginning.[84]\n\n\n\n### Renewal[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2017, Álex Pina said that part 2 had remote but intentional spin-off possibilities, and that his team was open to continue the robbers' story in the form of movies or a Netflix renewal.[92] Following the show's success on the streaming platform, Netflix approached Pina and Atresmedia to produce new chapters for the originally self-contained story. The writers withdrew themselves for more than two months to decide on a direction,[46] creating a bible with central ideas for new episodes in the process.[28] The crucial factors in accepting Netflix's deal were the creators recognising that characters still had things to say, and having the opportunity to deviate from the perfectly orchestrated heist of the first two parts.[52] Adamant that the story should be set in Spain again,[55] the producers wanted to make it a sequel rather than a direct continuation, and expand on the familiarity and affection between the characters instead of the former group of strangers.[11] Rio's capture was chosen as the catalyst to get the gang back together because he as the narrator's boyfriend represented the necessary emotional factor for the renewal not to be \"suicide.\"[93]\n\n\nNetflix officially renewed the series for the third part with a considerably increased budget on 18 April 2018,[20] which might make part 3 the most expensive series per episode in Spanish television history, according to *Variety*.[15] As writing was in progress, Pina stated in July 2018 that he appreciated Netflix's decision to make the episodes 45 to 50 minutes of length, as the narrative could be more compressed and international viewers would have more freedom to consume the story in smaller parts.[47] With Netflix's new push to improve the quality and appeal of its English-language versions of foreign shows, and over 70 percent of viewers in the United States choosing dubs over subtitles for the series, Netflix hired a new dubbing crew for part 3 and re-dubbed the first two parts accordingly.[1] Part 3, consisting of eight episodes, was released on 19 July 2019;[52] the first two episodes of part 3 also had a limited theatrical release in Spain one day before.[15]\n\n\nIn August 2019, Netflix announced that part 3 was streamed by 34 million household accounts within its first week of release, of which 24 million finished the series within this period,[69] thereby making it one of the most-watched productions on Netflix of all time, regardless of language.[94] The viewership of part 3 increased, when Netflix reported that part 3 was viewed 44 million households during its first month and became the most popular show on Netflix during the third quarter.[95] Netflix had an estimated 148 million subscribers world-wide in mid-2019.[96] In October 2019, Netflix ranked *Money Heist* as their third-most-watched TV series for the past twelve months,[97] and named it as the most-watched series across several European markets in 2019, including France, Spain and Italy, though not the UK.[98] Twitter ranked the show fourth in its \"Top TV shows worldwide\" of 2019.[99]\n\n\nFilming of an initially unannounced fourth part of eight episodes ended in August 2019.[52][53] Álex Pina and writer Javier Gómez Santander stated that unlike part 3, where the intention was to re-attract the audience with high-energy drama after the move to Netflix, the story of part 4 would unfold slower and be more character-driven.[100] At another occasion, Pina and executive producer Esther Martínez Lobato teased part 4 as the \"most traumatic [part] of all\" because \"this much tension has to explode somewhere\".[101] Alba Flores (Nairobi) said the scriptwriters had previously made many concessions to fans in part 3, but would go against audience wishes in part 4 and that \"anyone who loves Nairobi will suffer\".[102] According to Pedro Alonso (Berlin), the focus of part 4 would be on saving Nairobi's life and standing by each other to survive.[102] Part 4 was released on 3 April 2020;[103] a documentary involving the producers and the cast premiered on Netflix the same day, titled *Money Heist: The Phenomenon*.[104] Part 4 broke numerous viewership records for a non-English Netflix series, attracting 65 million of households during its first four weeks, and went to become the most watched non-English series at the time.[105][106]\n\n\nIn October 2019, the online editions of Spanish newspaper's *ABC* and *La Vanguardia* re-reported claims by the Spanish website formulatv.com that Netflix had renewed the series for a fifth part, and that pre-production had already begun.[107][108][109] In November 2019, *La Vanguardia* quoted director Jesús Colmenar's statement \"That there is going to be a fifth [part] can be said\", and that the new part would be filmed after Vancouver Media's new project *Sky Rojo*.[56] Colmenar also stated that there have been discussions with Netflix about creating a spin-off of the series,[56] as well as Pina.[110] In an interview in December 2019, Pina and Martínez Lobato would not discuss the possibility of a fifth part because of confidentiality contracts, and only said that \"Someone knows there will be [a part 5], but we don't.\"[101] On 31 July 2020, Netflix renewed the show for a fifth and final part.[111] On 24 May 2021, it was announced that the fifth part of the show would be released in two five-episode volumes on 3 September and 3 December, respectively.[112] Similar to *Money Heist: The Phenomenon*, a two-part documentary involving the producers and cast premiered on Netflix the same day, titled *Money Heist: From Tokyo to Berlin*.[113]\n\n\n\n## Adaptation and spin-off[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Money Heist (franchise)\n\n### South Korean adaptation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Money Heist: Korea – Joint Economic Area\n\nIn November 2020, Netflix announced that it would create a South Korean adaptation of the show. The 12-part production, titled *Money Heist: Korea - Joint Economic Area*, would be a collaboration between BH Entertainment and Contents Zium, with Kim Hong-sun set to direct.[114][115][116][117] Production of the adaptation had been delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea.[118]\n\n\nOn 29 April 2022, Netflix revealed that *Money Heist: Korea – Joint Economic Area: Part 1* would be released on 24 June 2022 and *Part 2* would be released on 9 December 2022.[2]\n\n\n\n### Spin-off series[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2021, Netflix announced that it will create a spin-off series titled *Berlin*, which is set to be released in December 29, 2023.[119][120] The series is created by Álex Pina and Esther Martínez Lobato, who \"loved the idea of introducing a new gang around Berlin in a completely different emotional state\".[121] The first season will consist of eight episodes, to be written by Pina, Lobato, David Oliva and David Berrocal.[121] Albert Pintó, Barrocal and Geoffrey Cowper will serve as directors.[121] Filming began in Paris on 3 October 2022 and will continue for several weeks in Madrid.[121]\n\n\nThe announced cast includes:[121]\n\n\n\n* Pedro Alonso as Andrés de Fonollosa (Berlin), reprising his *Money Heist* role of a hedonistic, intelligent jewel thief\n* Michelle Jenner as Keila, an electronics specialist\n* Tristán Ulloa as Damián, a philanthropic professor and Berlin’s confidant\n* Begoña Vargas as Cameron\n* Julio Peña Fernández as Roi\n* Joel Sánchez as Bruce, a relentless man of action\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Public response[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cosplay in Patras, Greece, in 2019.\n![](image)Nairobi mural in Ehrenfeld, Cologne.\nAfter the move to Netflix, the series remained the most-followed series on Netflix for six consecutive weeks and became one of the most popular series on IMDb.[84] It regularly trended on Twitter world-wide, largely because celebrities commented on it, such as football players Neymar and Marc Bartra, American singer Romeo Santos,[22] and author Stephen King.[77] While users flooded social networks with media of themselves wearing the robbers' outfit,[22] the robbers' costumes were worn at the Rio Carnival, and Dalí icons were shown on huge banners in Saudi Arabia football stadiums.[84] Real footage of these events would later be shown in part 3 as a tribute to the show's international success.[122] The Musée Grévin in Paris added statues of the robbers to its wax museum in summer 2018.[3] The show's iconography was used prominently by third parties for advertising,[123] sports presentations,[124] and in porn.[125]\n\n\nAlthough the show's first two parts were popular, the domestic market in Spain failed to convince Antena 3 to continue the series and it was shelved until international response escalated to the point where the cast and crew were called back for another two seasons.[126]\n\n\nThere have also been negative responses to the influence of the show. In numerous incidents, real heist men wore the show's red costumes and Dalì masks in their attacks or copied the fictional robbers' infiltration plans.[3][22][127] The robbers' costumes were banned at the 2019 Limassol Carnival Festival as a security measure as a result.[128] The series was used in an attack on YouTube, when hackers removed the most-played song in the platform's history, \"Despacito\", and left an image of the show instead.[129] In unrelated reports, a journalist from Turkish TV channel AkitTV and an Ankaran politician have both warned against the show for supposedly encouraging terrorism and being \"a dangerous symbol of rebellion\".[3]\n\n\nSpanish newspaper *El Mundo* saw the public response as a reflection of the \"climate of global disenchantment\" where the robbers represent the \"perfect antiheroes\",[16] and the *New Statesman* explained the show's resonance with international audiences as coming from the \"social and economic tensions it depicts, and because of the utopian escape it offers.\"[3] Viewer response was especially high in Mediterranean Europe and the Latin world, in particular Spain, Italy, France, Portugal, Brazil, Chile and Argentina,[52] so Spanish as a common language did not appear to be a unifying reason for the show's success.[17] Writer Javier Gómez Santander and actor Pedro Alonso (Berlin) rather argued that the Latin world used to feel at the periphery of global importance, but a new sentiment was coming that Spain could compete with the global players in terms of media production levels and give the rest of the world a voice.[17][69]\n\n\nNetflix partnered with *Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege* for an in-game event, where hostages on the Bank map, wore Money Heist outfits. Outfits for 2 in-game characters were purchasable and the music in the background during the heist, was Bella Ciao.[130]\n\n\nThe series is one of two Spanish-language TV series to be featured in *TV Time'*s top 50 most followed TV shows ever, currently being the fifth most followed series on the platform.[131]\n\n\n\n### Critical reception[edit]\n\n\nThe series' beginning on Antena 3 was received well by Spanish media.[86] Nayín Costas of *El Confidencial* named the premiere a promising start that captivated viewers with \"adrenaline, well-dosed touches of humor and a lot of tension,\" but considered it a challenge to maintain the dramatic tension for the remainder of the series.[132] While considering the pilot's voice-over narration unnecessary and the sound editing and dialogs lacking, Natalia Marcos of *El País* enjoyed the show's ensemble cast and the ambition, saying \"It is daring, brazen and entertaining, at least when it starts. Now we want more, which is not little.\"[44] Reviewing the full first part, Marcos lauded the series for its outstanding direction, the musical selection and for trying to innovate Spanish television, but criticized the length and ebbing tension.[87] At the end of the series' original run, Nayín Costas of *El Confidencial* commended the series for its \"high quality closure\" that may make the finale \"one of the best episodes of the Spanish season\", but regretted that it aimed to satisfy viewers with a predictable happy ending rather than risk to \"do something different, original, ambitious\", and that the show was unable to follow in the footsteps of Pina's *Locked Up*.[133]\n\n\nAfter the show's move to Netflix for its international release, Adrian Hennigan of the Israeli *Haaretz* said the series was \"more of a twisty thriller than soapy telenovela, driven by its ingenious plot, engaging characters, tense flash points, pulsating score and occasional moments of humor\", but taunted the English title \"Money Heist\" as bland.[70] In a scathing review, Pauline Bock of the British magazine *New Statesman* questioned the global hype of the series, saying that it was \"full of plot holes, clichéd slow-motions, corny love stories and gratuitous sex scenes\", before continuing to add that \"the music is pompous, the voice-over irritating, and it's terribly edited\".[3] John Doyle of *The Globe and Mail* praised parts 1 and 2 for the heist genre subversions; he also said that the series could be \"deliciously melodramatic at times\" with \"outrageous twists and much passion\" like a telenovela.[68] Jennifer Keishin Armstrong of the BBC saw the series' true appeal in the interpersonal dramas emerging through the heist between \"the beautiful robbers, their beautiful hostages, and the beautiful authorities trying to negotiate with them.\"[74] David Hugendick of *Die Zeit* found the series \"sometimes a bit sentimental, a little cartoonesque,\" and the drama sometimes too telenovela-like, but \"all with a good sense for timing and spectacle.\"[134]\n\n\nReview aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gave part 3 an approval rating of 100% based on 12 reviews, with an average rating of 7/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"An audacious plan told in a non-linear fashion keeps the third installment moving as *Money Heist* refocuses on the relations between its beloved characters.\"[135] While lauding the technical achievements, Javier Zurro of *El Español* described the third part as \"first-class entertainment\" that was unable to transcend its roots and lacked novelty. He felt unaffected by the internal drama between the characters and specifically, disliked Tokyo's narration for its hollowness.[67] Alex Jiménez of Spanish newspaper *ABC* found part 3 mostly succeeding in its attempts to reinvent the show and stay fresh.[122] Euan Ferguson of *The Guardian* recommended watching part 3, as \"it's still a glorious *Peaky Blinders*, just with tapas and subtitles,\"[136] while Pere Solà Gimferrer of *La Vanguardia* found that the number of plot holes in part 3 could only be endured with constant suspension of disbelief.[78] Though entertained, Alfonso Rivadeneyra García of Peruvian newspaper *El Comercio* said the show does \"what it does best: pretend to be the most intelligent boy in class when, in fact, it is only the cleverest.\"[137]\n\n\n\n## Awards and nominations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of awards and nominations received by Money Heist\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Award\n | Category\n | Nominees\n | Result\n | Ref.
