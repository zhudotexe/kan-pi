It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel (who died in 1896), awarded for outstanding contributions in physics.[1] As dictated by Nobel's will, the award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.[2] The award is presented in Stockholm at an annual ceremony on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death.[3] Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a monetary award prize that has varied throughout the years.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## Statistics[edit]\n\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded to 224 individuals as of 2023.[5] The first prize in physics was awarded in 1901 to Wilhelm Conrad R\u00f6ntgen, of Germany, who received 150,782 SEK. John Bardeen is the only laureate to win the prize twice\u2014in 1956 and 1972.\n\n\nWilliam Lawrence Bragg was the youngest Nobel laureate in physics; he won the prize in 1915 at the age of 25. He was also the youngest laureate for any Nobel prize until 2014 (when Malala Yousafzai won the Nobel Peace Prize at age 17).[6] The oldest Nobel Prize laureate in physics was Arthur Ashkin who was 96 years old when he was awarded the prize in 2018.[7]\n\n\nOnly five women have won the prize: Marie Curie (1903), Maria Goeppert-Mayer (1963), Donna Strickland (2018), Andrea Ghez (2020), and Anne L'Huillier (2023).[8] Before L'Huillier, each woman only ever received a quarter share of the prize, although Marie Curie did receive an unshared Nobel prize in chemistry in 1911. In 2023 L'Huillier received a one-third share.\n\n\nThere have been six years for which the Nobel Prize in Physics was not awarded (1916, 1931, 1934, 1940\u20131942). There were also nine years for which the Nobel Prize in Physics was delayed for one year:\n\n\n\n* The 1914 prize awarded to Max von Laue was announced only in November 1915.[9]\n* The Prize was not awarded in 1917, as the Nobel Committee for Physics decided that none of that year's nominations met the necessary criteria, but was awarded to Charles Glover Barkla in 1918 and counted as the 1917 prize.[10]\n* This precedent was followed for the 1918 prize awarded to Max Planck in 1919,[11]\n* the 1921 prize awarded to Albert Einstein in 1922,[12]\n* the 1924 prize awarded to Manne Siegbahn in 1925,[13]\n* the 1925 prize awarded to James Franck and Gustav Hertz in 1926,[14]\n* the 1928 prize awarded to Owen Richardson in 1929,[15]\n* the 1932 prize awarded to Werner Heisenberg in 1933,[16] and\n* the 1943 prize awarded to Otto Stern in 1944.[17]\n\n\nIoannidis *et al.* reported that half of the Nobel Prize for science awarded between 1995 and 2017 are clustered in few disciplines. Particle physics (14%), atomic physics (10.9%), and 3 non-physics disciplines are dominating the prize in recent decades. And then semiconductor physics and magnetics are the next most honoured physics disciplines.[18]\n\n\n\n## Laureates[edit]\n\n\n* 1901\n* 1910\n* 1920\n* 1930\n* 1940\n* 1950\n* 1960\n* 1970\n*

Geim had also been awarded an Ig Nobel Prize earlier in 2000 for levitating a frog using its intrinsic magnetism. He is the first and only individual, as of 2023, to have received both Nobel and Ig Nobel prizes, for which he holds the Guinness World Record.\n\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nAndre Geim was born to Konstantin Alekseyevich Geim and Nina Nikolayevna Bayer in Sochi, Russia, on 21 October 1958. Both his parents were engineers of German origin.[23][24] His grandfather Nikolay N. Bayer (Mykola Baier in Ukrainian) was a notable public figure in Ukraine of the early 20th century, one of its first nature conservationists and the founder/first rector of Kaminiets-Podilskyi University.[25][26]\n\n\nIn 1965, the family moved to Nalchik,[27] where he studied at a high school.[27] After graduation, he applied to the Moscow Engineering Physics Institute.[28] He took the entrance exams twice, but attributes his failure to qualify to discrimination on account of his German ethnicity.[23] He then applied to the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT), where he was accepted.\n\n\nHe said that at the time he would not have chosen to study solid-state physics, preferring particle physics or astrophysics, but is now happy with his choice.[29] He received a diplom (MSc degree equivalent) from MIPT in 1982 and a Candidate of Sciences (PhD equivalent) degree in metal physics in 1987 from the Institute of Solid State Physics (ISSP) at the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS) in Chernogolovka.[29][30]\n\n\n\n## Academic career[edit]\n\n\nAfter earning his PhD with Victor Petrashov,[4] Geim worked as a research scientist at the Institute for Microelectronics Technology (IMT) at RAS, and from 1990 as a post-doctoral fellow at the universities of Nottingham (twice), Bath, and Copenhagen. He said that while at Nottingham he could spend his time on research rather than \"swimming through Soviet treacle,\"[23] and determined to leave the Soviet Union.[31]\n\n\nHe obtained his first tenured position in 1994, when he was appointed associate professor at Radboud University Nijmegen, where he worked on mesoscopic superconductivity.[32] He later gained Dutch citizenship. One of his doctoral students at Nijmegen was Konstantin Novoselov, who went on to become his main research partner. However, Geim has said that he had an unpleasant time during his academic career in the Netherlands.\n\n\nHe was offered professorships at Nijmegen and Eindhoven, but turned them down as he found the Dutch academic system too hierarchical and full of petty politicking. \"This can be pretty unpleasant at times,\" he says. \"It's not like the British system where every staff member is an equal quantity.\"[31] On the other hand, Geim writes in his Nobel lecture that \"the situation was a bit surreal because outside the university walls I received a warm-hearted welcome from everyone around, including Jan Kees and other academics.\"[33] (Prof. Jan Kees Maan was the research boss of Geim during his time at Radboud University Nijmegen.)\n\n\nIn 2001 he became a professor of physics at the University of Manchester, and was appointed director of the Manchester Centre for Mesoscience and Nanotechnology in 2002. Geim's wife and long-standing co-author, Irina Grigorieva, also moved to Manchester as a lecturer in 2001. The same year, they were joined by Novoselov who moved to Manchester from Nijmegen, which awarded him a PhD in 2004. Geim served as Langworthy Professor between 2007 and 2013, leaving this endowed professorship to Novoselov in 2012.[30] Also, between 2007 and 2010 Geim was an EPSRC Senior Research Fellow before becoming one of Royal Society Research Professors.[30][34]\n\n\nGeim holds many honorary professorships including those from Tsinghua University (China), Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (Russia), and Radboud University Nijmegen (Netherlands).[35]\n\n\n\n## Research[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Graphene is an atomic-scale honeycomb lattice made of carbon atoms.\nGeim's achievements include the discovery of a simple method for isolating single atomic layers of graphite, known as graphene, in collaboration with researchers at the University of Manchester[36] and IMT. The team published their findings in October 2004 in *Science*.[37][38][39]\n\n\nGraphene consists of one-atom-thick layers of carbon atoms arranged in two-dimensional hexagons,[40][41] and is the thinnest material in the world, as well as one of the strongest and hardest.[42] The material has many potential applications.\n\n\nGeim said one of the first applications of graphene could be in the development of flexible touchscreens, and that he has not patented the material because he would need a specific application and an industrial partner.[43]\n\n\n\n![](image)\"Spider-Man test\" of gecko tape[17]\nGeim also developed a biomimetic adhesive which became known as gecko tape[17]\u2014so called because it works on the same principle as adhesion of gecko feet\u2014research of which is still in the early stages.[44] It is hoped that the development will eventually allow humans to scale ceilings, like Spider-Man.[45]\n\n\nGeim's research in 1997 into the possible effects of magnetism on water scaling led to the famous discovery of direct diamagnetic levitation of water, and led to a frog being levitated.[46] For this experiment, he and Michael Berry received the 2000 Ig Nobel Prize.[16] \"We were asked first whether we dared to accept this prize, and I take pride in our sense of humor and self-deprecation that we did\".[23]\n\n\nGeim has also carried out research on mesoscopic physics and superconductivity.[31][47]\n\n\nHe said of the range of subjects he has studied: \"Many people choose a subject for their PhD and then continue the same subject until they retire. I despise this approach. I have changed my subject five times before I got my first tenured position and that helped me to learn different subjects.\"[29] \"When one dares to try, rewards are not guaranteed but at least it is an adventure.\"[23]\n\n\nExpanding the scope of his research adventures, Geim started studying low-dimensional water in 2012, after his Nobel-prize achievements. A part of this work was acknowledged by the 2018 International Creativity Prize for Water.[48]\n\n\nHe named his favourite hamster, H.A.M.S. ter Tisha, co-author in a 2001 research paper.[37][49]\n\n\n\n## Honours and awards[edit]\n\n\nIn 2006 he appeared on the *Scientific American* 50.[50] The Institute of Physics awarded him the 2007 Mott Medal and Prize \"for his discovery of a new class of materials\u2014free-standing two-dimensional crystals\u2014in particular graphene\".[51] Geim was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2007.[52] His certificate of election reads: \n\n\n> Geim's research is notable for its internationally-recognised quality, originality and breadth. He has recently discovered a conceptually new class of materials strictly two-dimensional atomic crystals, including graphene. This has opened up a prolific research area including a new paradigm of \"relativistic-like condensed matter\", where relativistic quantum physics can be studied in a bench-top experiment. Previously, Geim pioneered ballistic Hall micromagnetometry and discovered a paramagnetic Meissner effect and new vortex physics in superconductors. He has also realised a microfabricated adhesive, based on the gecko's climbing mechanism, now being exploited by DuPont, BAe and TESA. His experiments at Nijmegen on magnetic levitation attracted worldwide media attention and stimulated international research in this field. His earlier research on mesoscopic physics included studies of non-local and interaction phenomena, and of the quantum motion of electrons in periodic and random magnetic fields. He disseminates science to the public and schoolchildren through broadcasts and \"roadshow\" lectures.[52]\n> \n> \n\n\nHe shared the 2008 EPS Europhysics Prize with Novoselov \"for discovering and isolating a single free-standing atomic layer of carbon (graphene) and elucidating its remarkable electronic properties\".[53] In 2009 he received the K\u00f6rber European Science Award.[54] The US National Academy of Sciences honoured him with the 2010 John J. Carty Award for the Advancement of Science \"for his experimental realisation and investigation of graphene, the two-dimensional form of carbon\".[55]\n\n\nHe was awarded one of six Royal Society 2010 Anniversary Research Professorships.[56] The Royal Society added its 2010 Hughes Medal \"for his revolutionary discovery of graphene and elucidation of its remarkable properties\".[57] He was awarded honorary doctorates from Delft University of Technology,[58] ETH Z\u00fcrich,[35] the University of Antwerp[59] and the University of Manchester. In 2010, Geim was appointed as Knight Commander of the Order of the Netherlands Lion for his contribution to Dutch Science.[2]\n\n\nIn 2011, Geim became a corresponding member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.[60] He is Honorary Professor of Moscow Phys-Tech, Honorary Professor of the University of Nijmegen, Honorary Fellow of the Institute of Physics (HonFInstP), Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry (HonFRSC), Honorary Fellow of Singapore Institute of Physics, Honorary Professor of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.[61] Geim was furthermore made a Knight Bachelor in the 2012 New Year Honours for services to science.[62][63] He was elected a foreign associate of the US National Academy of Sciences in May 2012.[64] He was awarded the Copley Medal in 2013 and the Carbon Medal in 2016. Geim received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 2017.[65] In addition to this he also won the 2018 Fray International Sustainability Award given to him by FLOGEN Star Outreach at SIPS 2018 [66]\n\n\n\n### Ig Nobel Prize in Physics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Magnetically levitating a live frog, an experiment that earned Geim and Michael Berry the 2000 Ig Nobel Prize\nGeim shared the 2000 Ig Nobel Prize in Physics with Sir Michael Berry for the frog experiment. The experiment involved magnetic properties of water scaling to levitate a small frog with magnets,[67] which he and Berry reported in the *European Journal of Physics* in 1997.[68]\n\n\nBy 2022, his Ig Nobel Prize-winning work on the magnetic levitation of a frog was reportedly part of the inspiration for China's lunar gravity research facility.[69][70]\n\n\n\n### Nobel Prize in Physics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Peter Diamond, Dale T. Mortensen, Christopher A. Pissarides, Konstantin Novoselov, Andre Geim, Akira Suzuki, Ei-ichi Negishi, and Richard Heck, Nobel Prize Laureates 2010, at a press conference at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm.\nOn 5 October 2010, Geim was awarded the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics jointly with Novoselov \"for groundbreaking experiments regarding the two-dimensional material graphene\".[71] Upon hearing of the award he said, \"I'm fine, I slept well. I didn't expect the Nobel Prize this year\", and that his plans for the day would not change.[72] The lecture for the award took place on 8 December 2010 at Stockholm University.[73] He said he hopes that graphene and other two-dimensional crystals will change everyday life as plastics did for humanity, although we need to wait for a few decades to see the results.[74]\n\n\nMark Miodownik said that his Ig Nobel Prize shows that people can still win a Nobel by \"mucking about in a lab\".[75] The awards made him the first person to win, as an individual, both a Nobel Prize and an Ig Nobel Prize.[76] On winning both the prizes, he has stated that\n\n\n\n\n> \"Frankly, I value both my Ig Nobel prize and Nobel prize at the same level and for me Ig Nobel prize was the manifestation that I can take jokes, a little bit of self-deprecation always helps.\"[4]\n> \n> \n\n\n2010, Geim was inducted into the Guinness World Records as the \"First individual to win both a Nobel and Ig Nobel prize\".[77]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### View and opinions[edit]\n\n\nGeim was one of 38 Nobel laureates who signed a declaration in 2010 issued by Scholars for Peace in the Middle East protesting an international initiative to boycott Israeli academics, institutions, and research centers.[78]\n\n\nAt the *Nobel Minds* symposium in December 2010, Geim said the Nobel Peace Prize committee's choice of Chinese dissident, the imprisoned Liu Xiaobo, as winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, was patronising, saying \n\n\n\n\n> \"Look at the people who give this Nobel prize. They are retired Norwegian politicians who have spent all their careers in a safe environment, in an oil-rich modern country. They try to extend their views of the world, how the world should work and how democracy works in another country. It's very, very patronising\u2014 they have not lived in these countries. In the past 10 years, China has developed not only economically, but even the strongest human rights supporter would agree also human rights have improved. Why do we need to distort this?\"[79][80]\n> \n> \n\n\nGeim has written several opinion pieces for *The Financial Times*, examples of which can be found on his university webpage.[81]\n\n\nIn 2014, Geim's interview for *Desert Island Discs*, a popular BBC radio programme, revealed details of his personal life and taste in music.[82]\n\n\nA quote from Geim was deliberately doctored by the campaign group Vote Leave in the run-up to the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum. An open letter about science, signed by 13 Conservative MPs including Boris Johnson, attempted to paint European science funding as unnecessarily bureaucratic and deliberately misrepresented Geim's views on Europe:\n\n\n\n\n> As the Nobel Prize winner Andre Geim said: 'I can offer no nice words for the EU framework programmes [for research] which ... can be praised only by Europhobes for discrediting the whole idea of an effectively working Europe.'\n> \n> \n\n\nThe ellipsis (...) present in the quotation from Geim's Nobel lecture removed the words \"except for the European Research Council\".[83]\n\n\n\n### Identity[edit]\n\n\nGeim has a complex ancestry which is described in detail in his Nobel Prize autobiography.[23] There, Geim stated that most of his family are ethnic Germans, his father descended from Volga Germans and his mother mostly an ethnic German as well. Both his father and paternal grandfather had spent many years of their lives as prisoners in Siberia in Stalin's Gulags, and \"some of the family had been prisoners in German concentration camps\". He also states that he \"suffered from anti-Semitism in Russia because my name sounds Jewish\".[84]\n\n\nGeim summarises his identity as follows. \"To the best of my knowledge, the only Jew in the family was my great-grandmother, with the rest on both sides being German. Having lived and worked in several European countries, I consider myself European and do not believe that any further taxonomy is necessary, especially in such a fluid world as the world of science.\"[23][85]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"The Nobel Prize in Physics 2010\".

He studied vortex structures in mesoscopic superconductors, observed atomic-scale movements of ferromagnetic walls, monitored heartbeats of individual bacteria and mimicked gecko's adhesion mechanism. His breakthrough moment was the discovery of graphene. Novoselov is now widely recognised to be one of the pioneers in this field (as a number of international awards prove) and, together with Prof Geim FRS, leads research on various applications of this new material ranging from electronics, photonics, composite materials, chemistry, etc. Prof. Novoselov is strongly committed to disseminating science through public lectures and media interviews.[1]\n> \n> \n\n\n![](image)Novoselov while painting at the residence of Chinese Consul General Li in Manchester.\n## National Graphene Institute[edit]\n\n\nNovoselov led the academic team which overviewed the design, construction and launching of the National Graphene Institute.[55] He contributed with a number of unique architectural and technical solutions.[56] The veil of the National Graphene Institute depicts formulae from his and Prof. A. Geim early works on graphene.[57] Also, Novoselov confirms that among the formulae several scientific jokes are hidden, though he has never revealed them.[58]\n\n\nHe co-authored a book on the architecture of the National Graphene Institute.[59]\n\n\n\n## Other projects[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, in a project of exploration of the archives of the Jodrell Bank Observatory, Prof. Novoselov helped Prof. Tim O'Brian to transcribe radio transmission (most possibly simulated instrument reading) from the Soviet Zond 6 received by radio telescope at Jodrell Bank Observatory in November 1968.[60],[61]\n\n\n\n## Art involvement[edit]\n\n\nNovoselov is known for his interest in art.[62] He practices in Chinese traditional drawing[63] and has been involved in several projects on modern art.[64] \nThus, in February 2015 he combined forces with Cornelia Parker to create a display for the opening of the Whitworth Art Gallery. Cornelia Parker's meteorite shower firework (pieces of meteorites loaded in firework) was launched by Novoselov breathing on graphene gas sensor (which changed the resistance of graphene due to doping by water vapour). Graphene was obtained through exfoliation of graphite which was extracted from a drawing of William Blake. Novoselov suggested that he also exfoliated graphite obtained from the drawings of other prominent artists: John Constable, Pablo Picasso, J. M. W. Turner, Thomas Girtin. He said that only microscopic amounts (flake size less than 100 micrometres) was extracted from each of the drawings.[64] In 2015 he participated in \"in conversation\" session with Douglas Gordon during Interdependence session at Manchester International Festival.[65]\n\n\nHe also participates in discussions on the relation between art and science. Novoselov believes that artists and scientists both rely on curiosity, willingness to learn and imagination:\n\n\n\n\n> Artists and scientists both think outside the box. They've got to come with genius experiments or ideas to expose the most interesting phenomena. Later, they've got to diverge a little bit because scientists will start to look at the common elements between many of the phenomena to describe the most general law, and artists will probably try to study individuals rather than the crowd as a whole. But we're just two sides of the same medal.[64]\n> \n> \n\n\nNovoselov is fond of Chinese calligraphy and drawing.[63] He learned it from a prominent Chinese artist Zheng Shenglong. Nine ink paintings by Prof. Novoselov were shown at the exhibition \"Britain Through the Eyes of a Chinese Diplomat\" at the University of Leeds.[66]\nOne of his paintings is now in the collection of President of China Xi Jinping.[67]\n\n\nNovoselov participated in Viennacontemporary in 2017,[68] where 5 of his works have been presented by RDI.Creative gallery. The paintings presented a range of topics, from the very traditional Chinese paintings to landscapes to contemporary subjects. It is claimed that graphene ink has been used in at least some of those paintings.[68]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nNovoselov holds both Russian and British citizenship.[69] He is married and has two daughters.[3] He is an agnostic.[70]\n\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2022, he signed an open letter by Russian scientists condemning the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[71]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** \"Certificate of Election EC/2011/34: Kostya Novoselov\".

Muller[1] |\n|  |\n\n\n**Saul Perlmutter** (born September 22, 1959) is a U.S. astrophysicist, a professor of physics at the University of California, Berkeley, where he holds the Franklin W. and Karen Weber Dabby Chair, and head of the International Supernova Cosmology Project at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. He is a member of both the American Academy of Arts & Sciences and the American Philosophical Society,[2] and was elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2003. He is also a member of the National Academy of Sciences. Perlmutter shared the 2006 Shaw Prize in Astronomy, the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics, and the 2015 Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics with Brian P. Schmidt and Adam Riess for providing evidence that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. Since 2021, he has been a member of the President\u2019s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST).[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nSaul Perlmutter was born one of three children in the Ashkenazi Jewish family of Daniel D. Perlmutter, professor emeritus of chemical and biomolecular engineering at University of Pennsylvania, and Felice (Feige) D. Perlmutter (n\u00e9e Davidson), professor emerita of Temple University\u2019s School of Social Administration.[4][5] His maternal grandfather, the Yiddish teacher Samuel Davidson (1903\u20131989), emigrated to Canada (and then with his wife Chaika Newman to New York) from the Bessarabian town of Flore\u015fti in 1919.[6]\n\n\nPerlmutter spent his childhood in the Mount Airy neighborhood of Philadelphia. He went to school in nearby Germantown; first Greene Street Friends School for the elementary grades, followed by Germantown Friends School for grades 7 through 12.[7] He graduated with an AB in physics from Harvard *magna cum laude* in 1981 and received his PhD in physics from Berkeley in 1986. Perlmutter's PhD thesis, titled \"An Astrometric Search for a Stellar Companion to the Sun\" and supervised by Richard A. Muller,[8] described the development and use of an automated telescope to search for Nemesis candidates.[1] At the same time, he was using this telescope to search for Nemesis and supernovae, which would lead him to his award-winning work in cosmology.[9] Perlmutter attributes the idea for an automated supernova search to Luis Alvarez, a 1968 Nobel laureate, who shared his idea with Perlmutter's research adviser.[9]\n\n\n\n## Work[edit]\n\n\nPerlmutter heads the Supernova Cosmology Project at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. It was this team along with the competing High-z Supernova Search Team led by Riess and Schmidt, which found evidence of the accelerating expansion of the universe based on observing Type Ia supernova in the distant universe. Type Ia supernova occurs whenever a white dwarf star gains enough additional mass to pass above the Chandrasekhar limit, usually by stealing additional mass from a companion star. Since all Type Ia supernovae are believed to occur in essentially the same way, they form a standard candle whose intrinsic luminosity can be assumed to be approximately the same in all cases. By measuring the apparent luminosity of the explosion from Earth, researchers can then infer the distance to supernova. Comparing this inferred distance to the apparent redshift of the explosion allows the observer to measure both the distance and relative velocity of the supernova.\n\n\nThe Supernova Cosmology Project concluded that these distant supernovae were receding more quickly than would be expected due to the Hubble expansion alone, and, by inference, the expansion of the universe must have been accelerated over the billions of years since the supernovae occurred. The High-z Team also came to a similar conclusion. The two teams' reports were published within weeks of each other, and their conclusions were readily accepted by the scientific community due to corroborating theories.[10] This conclusion has subsequently been supported by other lines of evidence. These findings reinvigorated research into the nature of the universe, and especially into the role of dark energy.[10] For this work Perlmutter was awarded the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics, shared jointly with Riess and Schmidt.[10]\n\n\nPerlmutter is also a lead investigator in the Supernova/Acceleration Probe project, which aims to build a satellite dedicated to finding and studying more supernovae in the distant universe. The goal is to more precisely determine the rate at which the universe has been accelerating. He is also a participant in the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature project, which aims to increase our understanding of recent global warming through improved analyses of climate data.\n\n\nPerlmutter is a professor and currently teaches at UC Berkeley.\n\n\n\n## Awards and recognition[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Perlmutter, Adam Riess, and Brian P. Schmidt being awarded the 2006 Shaw Prize in Astronomy. The trio would later be awarded the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics.\n![](image)Perlmutter presenting his Nobel lecture at Aula Magna\nIn 2002, Perlmutter won the Department of Energy's E. O. Lawrence Award in Physics. In 2003, he was awarded the California Scientist of the Year Award, and, in 2005, he won the John Scott Award and the Padua Prize. In 2006, he shared the Shaw Prize in Astronomy with Adam Riess and Brian P. Schmidt.[11] The same year, Perlmutter won the Antonio Feltrinelli International Prize.\n\n\nPerlmutter and his team shared the 2007 Gruber Cosmology Prize (a $500,000 award) with Schmidt and the High-Z Team for discovering the accelerating expansion of the universe. In 2010, Perlmutter was named a Miller Senior Fellow of the Miller Institute at the University of California Berkeley. In 2011, Perlmutter and Riess were named co-recipients of the Albert Einstein Medal.\n\n\nPerlmutter shared the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics with Riess and Schmidt.[11] The Nobel Prize includes a SEK 10 million cash award (approximately US$1.5 million). Perlmutter received one-half of the cash prize, while Riess and Schmidt shared the other half.[11]\n\n\nIn 2014, Perlmutter received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.[12]\n\n\nPerlmutter, Schmidt, Riess and their teams shared the 2015 Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics with $3 million to be split among them.[13]\n\n\nA United States Department of Energy 2020 supercomputer is named Perlmutter in his honor.[14]\n\n\n\n## Family[edit]\n\n\nSaul Perlmutter has two sisters: Shira Perlmutter (b. 1956), a lawyer, and Tova Perlmutter (b. 1967), a nonprofit executive. He is married to Laura Nelson, an anthropologist at University of California, Berkeley, and has one daughter, Noa.[15]\n\n\n\n## Popular culture[edit]\n\n\nReference to Saul Perlmutter was made on the CBS television comedy series *The Big Bang Theory* during the 2011 episode \"The Speckerman Recurrence\". In the episode, the character Sheldon Cooper watches the Nobel award ceremony on his laptop, and jealously berates Perlmutter: \"Look at Dr. Saul Perlmutter up there, clutching that Nobel prize. What's the matter Saul, you afraid somebody's going to steal it? Like you stole Einstein's cosmological constant?\" Then later: \"Oh, now Perlmutter's shaking the King's hand. Yeah, check for your watch, Gustaf, he might have lifted it.\"\n\n\nPerlmutter was also referenced in the 2011 episode of *The Big Bang Theory*, \"The Rhinitis Revelation\". In a conversation with his mother, Sheldon says, \"I\u2019ve got a treat for us tomorrow, Mom. I\u2019m taking you to see Saul Perlmutter give a lecture about his Nobel Prize-winning work in cosmology. And the best part is, at the Q and A afterward, I\u2019ve worked up a couple of Q\u2019s that will stump his sorry A.\" Later in the episode, Sheldon criticises the lecture and questions the decision to award Perlmutter a Nobel Prize.\n\n\n\n## Technical reports and conference/event proceedings[edit]\n\n\n* Perlmutter, S., *et al.* \"Progress Report on the Berkeley/Anglo-Australian Observatory High-redshift Supernova Search\", Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, (November 1990).\n* Perlmutter, S., *et al.* \"Discovery of the Most Distant Supernovae and the Quest for {Omega}\", Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, (May 1994).\n* Perlmutter, S., *et al.* \"Discovery of a Supernova Explosion at Half the Age of the Universe and its Cosmological Implications\", Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, (December 16, 1997).\n* Perlmutter, S., *et al.* \"The Distant Type Ia Supernova Rate\", Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, (May 28, 2002).\n* Perlmutter, S., *et al.* \"The Supernova Legacy Survey: Measurement of Omega\\_M, Omega\\_Lambda, and w from the First Year Data Set\", Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, (October 14, 2005).\n* Perlmutter, S. \"Supernovae, Dark Energy and the Accelerating Universe: How DOE Helped to Win (yet another) Nobel Prize\", Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, (January 13, 2012).\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Jewish Nobel laureates\n* Cosmological constant\n* Dark energy\n* Dark matter\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Goldhaber, Gerson (2009). *The Acceleration of the Expansion of the Universe: A Brief Early History of the Supernova Cosmology Project (SCP)*.

Wineland for \"ground-breaking experimental methods that enable measuring and manipulation of individual quantum systems\", a study of the particle of light, the photon.[2][3][4] This and his other works developed laser spectroscopy. Since 2001, Haroche is a professor at the Coll\u00e8ge de France and holds the chair of quantum physics.\n\n\nIn 1971 he defended his doctoral thesis in physics at the University of Paris VI: his research had been conducted under the direction of Claude Cohen-Tannoudji.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nHaroche was born in Casablanca, Morocco, to Albert Haroche (1920\u20131998), from a Moroccan Jewish family, and Valentine Haroche, born Roubleva (1921\u20131998), a teacher who was born in Odessa to a Jewish family of physicians who relocated to Morocco in the early 1920s. His father, a lawyer trained in Rabat, was one of seven children born to a family of teachers, Isaac and Esther Haroche, who worked at the *\u00c9cole de l\u2019Alliance isra\u00e9lite* (AIU).[6][7][8][9][10][11][12]\n\n\nBoth paternal grandparents of Serge Haroche had been AIU students in their respective hometowns of Marrakesh and T\u00e9touan (the school which Esther Azerad attended in T\u00e9touan had been founded in 1862; it was the first school of the AIU network).[13]\n\n\nHaroche left Morocco and settled in France in 1956, at the end of the French protectorate treaty.\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nHaroche worked in the Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS) as a research scientist from 1967 to 1975, and spent a year (1972\u20131973) as a visiting post-doc in Stanford University, in Arthur Leonard Schawlow's team. In 1975 he moved to a professor position at Paris VI University. At the same time he taught in other institutions, in particular at the \u00c9cole polytechnique (1973\u20131984), MIT (1980)[1], Harvard University (1981), Yale University (1984\u20131993) and Conservatoire national des arts et m\u00e9tiers (2000). He was head of the Physics department at the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure from 1994 to 2000.\n\n\nSince 2001, Haroche has been a professor at the Coll\u00e8ge de France and holds the chair of quantum physics.\nHe is a member of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise de Physique, the European Physical society and a fellow and member of the American Physical Society.\n\n\nIn September 2012, Serge Haroche was elected by his peers to the position of administrator of the Coll\u00e8ge de France.\n\n\nOn 9 October 2012 Haroche was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, together with the American physicist David Wineland, for their work regarding measurement and manipulation of individual quantum systems.\n\n\nIn 2020, Haroche was appointed by European Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth Mariya Gabriel to serve on an independent search committee for the next president of the European Research Council (ERC), chaired by Helga Nowotny.[14]\n\n\n\n## Research[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Serge Haroche (who won Nobel Prize in Physics in 2012) visited Stockholm, June 2016, as a member of the Wallenberg Foundation Scientific Advisory Board.\nHaroche works primarily in atomic physics and quantum optics.[15][16][17][18][19][20][21] He is principally known for showing quantum decoherence by experimental observation, while working with colleagues at the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure in Paris in 1996.\n\n\nAfter a PhD dissertation on dressed atoms under the supervision of Claude Cohen-Tannoudji (himself a Nobel Prize recipient) from 1967 to 1971, he developed new methods for laser spectroscopy, based on the study of quantum beats and superradiance. He then moved on to Rydberg atoms, giant atomic states particularly sensitive to microwaves, which makes them well adapted for studying the interactions between light and matter. He showed that such atoms, coupled to a superconducting cavity containing a few photons, are well-suited to the testing of quantum decoherence and to the realization of quantum logic operations necessary for the treatment of quantum information.\n\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\nSerge Haroche after his Nobel Lecture\n* Commander of the French Legion of Honour\n* 1988 Einstein Prize for Laser Science (awarded at *Lasers* '88).\n* 1990 Fellow of the American Physical Society[22]\n* 1992 The Humboldt Prize\n* 1993 Albert A.

His work has included advances in optics, specifically laser-cooling trapped ions and using ions for quantum-computing operations. He was awarded the 2012 Nobel Prize in Physics, jointly with Serge Haroche, for \"ground-breaking experimental methods that enable measuring and manipulation of individual quantum systems\".[3][4]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and career[edit]\n\n\nWineland was born in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin. He lived in Denver until he was three years old, at which time his family moved to Sacramento, California.[5] Wineland graduated from Encina High School in Sacramento in 1961.[1] In Sept. 1961 - Dec. 1963, he studied at University of California, Davis. He received his bachelor's degree in physics from the University of California, Berkeley in 1965 and his master's and doctoral degrees in physics from Harvard University.[5] He completed his PhD in 1970, supervised by Norman Foster Ramsey, Jr.[6] His doctoral dissertation is titled \"The Atomic Deuterium Maser\". He then performed postdoctoral research in Hans Dehmelt's group at the University of Washington where he investigated electrons in ion traps. In 1975, he joined the National Bureau of Standards (now called NIST), where he started the ion storage group and is on the physics faculty of the University of Colorado at Boulder. In January 2018, Wineland moved to the Department of Physics University of Oregon as a Knight Research Professor,[7] while still being engaged with the Ion Storage Group at NIST in a consulting role.\n\n\nWineland was the first to laser-cool ions in 1978. His NIST group uses trapped ions in many experiments on fundamental physics, and quantum state control. They have demonstrated optical techniques to prepare ground, superposition and entangled states. This work has led to advances in spectroscopy, atomic clocks and quantum information. In 1995 he created the first single atom quantum logic gate and was the first to quantum teleport information in massive particles in 2004.[8] Wineland implemented the most precise atomic clock using quantum logic on a single aluminum ion in 2005.[9]\n\n\nWineland is a fellow of the American Physical Society and[10] the American Optical Society, and was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1992.[11] He shared the 2012 Nobel Prize in Physics with French physicist Serge Haroche \"for ground-breaking experimental methods that enable measuring and manipulation of individual quantum systems.\"[3]\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n## Family[edit]\n\n\nWineland is married to Sedna Quimby-Wineland, and they have two sons.[12]\n\n\nSedna Helen Quimby is the daughter of George I. Quimby (1913-2003), an archaeologist and anthropologist, who was Professor of Anthropology at the University of Washington and Director of the Thomas Burke Memorial Washington State Museum, and his wife Helen Ziehm Quimby.[13]\n\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\n* 1990 Davisson-Germer Prize in Atomic or Surface Physics\n* 1990 William F. Meggers Award of the  Optical Society of America\n* 1996 Einstein Prize for Laser Science of the Society of Optical and Quantum Electronics (awarded at *Lasers* '96)\n* 1998 Rabi Award from the IEEE Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control Society[14]\n* 2001 Arthur L.

He is also a Sackler Professor by Special Appointment in the School of Physics and Astronomy at Tel Aviv University and a member of the Institute for Quantum Studies at Chapman University in California. He was awarded the 2010 J.\u00a0J.\u00a0Sakurai Prize for Theoretical Particle Physics (with Gerry Guralnik, C.\u00a0R.\u00a0Hagen, Tom Kibble, Peter Higgs, and Robert Brout), the Wolf Prize in Physics in 2004 (with Brout and Higgs) and the High Energy and Particle Prize of the European Physical Society (with Brout and Higgs) in 1997 for the mechanism which unifies short and long range interactions by generating massive gauge vector bosons.\n\n\nEnglert has made contributions in statistical physics, quantum field theory, cosmology, string theory and supergravity.[4] He is the recipient of the 2013 Prince of Asturias Award in technical and scientific research, together with Peter Higgs and the CERN.\n\n\nEnglert was awarded the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physics, together with Peter Higgs for the discovery of the Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nFran\u00e7ois Englert is a Holocaust survivor.[6] He was born in a Belgian Jewish family. During the German occupation of Belgium in World War II, he had to conceal his Jewish identity and live in orphanages and children's homes in the towns of Dinant, Lustin, Stoumont and, finally, Annevoie-Rouillon. These towns were eventually liberated by the US Army.\n\n\n\n## Academic career[edit]\n\n\nHe graduated as an electromechanical engineer in 1955 from the Free University of Brussels (ULB) where he received his PhD in physical sciences in 1959. From 1959 until 1961, he worked at Cornell University, first as a research associate of Robert Brout and then as assistant professor. He then returned to the ULB, where he became a university professor and was joined there by Robert Brout who, in 1980, with Englert coheaded the theoretical physics group. In 1998 Englert became professor emeritus. In 1984 Englert was first appointed as a Sackler Professor by Special Appointment in the School of Physics and Astronomy at Tel-Aviv University. Englert joined Chapman University's Institute for Quantum Studies in 2011, where he serves as a distinguished visiting professor.\n\n\n\n## The Brout\u2013Englert\u2013Higgs\u2013Guralnik\u2013Hagen\u2013Kibble mechanism[edit]\n\n\n[7]\nBrout and Englert showed in 1964[8] that gauge vector fields, abelian and non-abelian, could acquire mass if empty space were endowed with a particular type of structure that one encounters in material systems. Focusing on the failure of the Goldstone theorem for gauge fields,[9] Higgs reached essentially the same result.[10] A third paper on the subject was written later in the same year by Gerald Guralnik, C. R. Hagen, and Tom Kibble.[11] The three papers written on this boson discovery by Higgs, Englert and Brout, and Guralnik, Hagen, Kibble were each recognized as milestone papers for this discovery by Physical Review Letters 50th anniversary celebration.[12] While each of these famous papers took similar approaches, the contributions and differences between the 1964 PRL symmetry breaking papers is noteworthy.\n\n\nTo illustrate the structure, consider a ferromagnet which is composed of atoms each equipped with a tiny magnet. When these magnets are lined up, the inside of the ferromagnet bears a strong analogy to the way empty space can be structured. Gauge vector fields that are sensitive to this structure of empty space can only propagate over a finite distance. Thus, they mediate short range interactions and acquire mass. Those fields that are not sensitive to the structure propagate unhindered. They remain massless and are responsible for the long range interactions. In this way, the mechanism accommodates within a single unified theory both short and long-range interactions.\n\n\nBrout and Englert, Higgs, and Gerald Guralnik, C. R. Hagen, and Tom Kibble introduced as agent of the vacuum structure a scalar field (most often called the Higgs field) which many physicists view as the agent responsible for the masses of fundamental particles. Brout and Englert also showed that the mechanism may remain valid if the scalar field is replaced by a more structured agent such as a fermion condensate. Their approach led them to conjecture that the theory is renormalizable.[13] The eventual proof of renormalizability, a major achievement of twentieth century physics, is due to Gerardus 't Hooft and Martinus Veltman who were awarded the 1999 Nobel Prize for this work. The Brout\u2013Englert\u2013Higgs\u2013Guralnik\u2013Hagen\u2013Kibble mechanism is the building stone of the electroweak theory of elementary particles and laid the foundation of a unified view of the basic laws of nature.\n\n\n\n## Major awards[edit]\n\n\n* 1978 First Prize in the International Gravity Contest (with R. Brout and E. Gunzig), awarded by the Gravity Research Foundation for the essay \"The Causal Universe\".[14]\n* 1982 Francqui Prize, awarded by the Francqui Foundation once every four years in exact sciences \"For his contribution to the theoretical understanding of spontaneous symmetry breaking in the physics of fundamental interactions, where, with Robert Brout, he was the first to show that spontaneous symmetry breaking in gauge theories gives mass to the gauge particles, for his extensive contributions in other domains, such as solid state physics, statistical mechanics, quantum field theory, general relativity and cosmology, for the originality and the fundamental importance of these achievements\".\n* 1997 High Energy and Particle Physics Prize (with R. Brout and P.W. Higgs), awarded by the European Physical Society \"For formulating for the first time a self-consistent theory of charged massive vector bosons which became the foundation of the electroweak theory of elementary particles\".[15]\n* 2004 Wolf Prize in Physics (with R.

This so-called Higgs mechanism, which was proposed by several physicists besides Higgs at about the same time, predicts the existence of a new particle, the Higgs boson, the detection of which became one of the great goals of physics.[10][11] On 4 July 2012, CERN announced the discovery of the boson at the Large Hadron Collider.[12] The Higgs mechanism is generally accepted as an important ingredient in the Standard Model of particle physics, without which certain particles would have no mass.[13]\n\n\nHiggs has been honoured with a number of awards in recognition of his work, including the 1981 Hughes Medal from the Royal Society; the 1984 Rutherford Medal from the Institute of Physics; the 1997 Dirac Medal and Prize for outstanding contributions to theoretical physics from the Institute of Physics; the 1997 High Energy and Particle Physics Prize by the European Physical Society; the 2004 Wolf Prize in Physics; the 2009 Oskar Klein Memorial Lecture medal from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences; the 2010 American Physical Society J. J. Sakurai Prize for Theoretical Particle Physics; and a unique Higgs Medal from the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 2012.[14] The discovery of the Higgs boson prompted fellow physicist Stephen Hawking to note that he thought that Higgs should receive the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work,[15][16] which he finally did, shared with Fran\u00e7ois Englert in 2013.[17] Higgs was appointed to the Order of the Companions of Honour in the 2013 New Year Honours[18][19] and in 2015 the Royal Society awarded him the Copley Medal, the world's oldest scientific prize.[20]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nHiggs was born in the Elswick district of Newcastle upon Tyne, England, to Thomas Ware Higgs (1898\u20131962) and his wife Gertrude Maude n\u00e9e Coghill (1895\u20131969).[14][21][22][23][24] His father worked as a sound engineer for the BBC, and as a result of childhood asthma, together with the family moving around because of his father's job and later World War II, Higgs missed some early schooling and was taught at home. When his father relocated to Bedford, Higgs stayed behind in Bristol with his mother, and was largely raised there. He attended Cotham Grammar School in Bristol from 1941\u201346,[14][25] where he was inspired by the work of one of the school's alumni, Paul Dirac, a founder of the field of quantum mechanics.[23]\n\n\nIn 1946, at the age of 17, Higgs moved to City of London School, where he specialised in mathematics, then in 1947 to King's College London where he graduated with a first class honours degree in Physics in 1950 and achieved a master's degree in 1952. He was awarded an 1851 Research Fellowship from the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851,[26] and performed his doctoral research in molecular physics under the supervision of Charles Coulson and Christopher Longuet-Higgins.[1] He was awarded a PhD degree in 1954 with a thesis entitled *Some problems in the theory of molecular vibrations* from King's College London.[1][14][27]\n\n\n\n## Career and research[edit]\n\n\nAfter finishing his doctorate, Higgs was appointed a Senior Research Fellow at the University of Edinburgh (1954\u201356). He then held various posts at Imperial College London, and University College London (where he also became a temporary lecturer in Mathematics). He returned to the University of Edinburgh in 1960 to take up the post of Lecturer at the Tait Institute of Mathematical Physics, allowing him to settle in the city he had enjoyed while hitchhiking to the Western Highlands as a student in 1949.[28][29] He was promoted to Reader, became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (FRSE) in 1974 and was promoted to a Personal Chair of Theoretical Physics in 1980. He retired in 1996 and became Emeritus professor at the University of Edinburgh.[6]\n\n\nHiggs was elected Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1983 and Fellow of the Institute of Physics (FInstP) in 1991. He was awarded the Rutherford Medal and Prize in 1984. He received an honorary degree from the University of Bristol in 1997. In 2008 he received an Honorary Fellowship from Swansea University for his work in particle physics.[30]\n\n\nAt Edinburgh Higgs first became interested in mass, developing the idea that particles \u2013 massless when the universe began \u2013 acquired mass a fraction of a second later as a result of interacting with a theoretical field (which became known as the Higgs field). Higgs postulated that this field permeates space, giving mass to all elementary subatomic particles that interact with it.[23][31]\n\n\nThe Higgs mechanism postulates the existence of the Higgs field which confers mass on quarks and leptons.[32] However this causes only a tiny portion of the masses of other subatomic particles, such as protons and neutrons. In these, gluons that bind quarks together confer most of the particle mass.\n\n\nThe original basis of Higgs' work came from the Japanese-born theorist and Nobel Prize laureate Yoichiro Nambu from the University of Chicago. Professor Nambu had proposed a theory known as spontaneous symmetry breaking based on what was known to happen in superconductivity in condensed matter; however, the theory predicted massless particles (the Goldstone's theorem), a clearly incorrect prediction.[6]\n\n\nHiggs is reported to have developed the fundamentals of his theory after returning to his Edinburgh New Town apartment from a failed weekend camping trip to the Highlands.[33][34][35] He stated that there was no \"eureka moment\" in the development of the theory.[36] He wrote a short paper exploiting a loophole in Goldstone's theorem (massless Goldstone particles need not occur when local symmetry is spontaneously broken in a relativistic theory[37]) and published it in *Physics Letters*, a European physics journal edited at CERN, in Switzerland, in 1964.[38]\n\n\nHiggs wrote a second paper describing a theoretical model (now called the Higgs mechanism), but the paper was rejected (the editors of *Physics Letters* judged it \"of no obvious relevance to physics\").[23] Higgs wrote an extra paragraph and sent his paper to *Physical Review Letters*, another leading physics journal, which published it later in 1964. This paper predicted a new massive spin-zero boson (now known as the Higgs boson).[37][39]\nOther physicists, Robert Brout and Fran\u00e7ois Englert[40] and Gerald Guralnik, C. R. Hagen and Tom Kibble[41]\nhad reached similar conclusions about the same time. In the published version Higgs quotes Brout and Englert and the third paper quotes the previous ones. The three papers written on this boson discovery by Higgs, Guralnik, Hagen, Kibble, Brout, and Englert were each recognised as milestone papers by *Physical Review Letters* 50th anniversary celebration.[42] While each of these famous papers took similar approaches, the contributions and differences between the 1964 PRL symmetry breaking papers are noteworthy. The mechanism had been proposed in 1962 by Philip Anderson although he did not include a crucial relativistic model.[37][43]\n\n\nOn 4 July 2012, CERN announced the ATLAS and Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiments had seen strong indications for the presence of a new particle, which could be the Higgs boson, in the mass region around 126 gigaelectronvolts (GeV).[44]\nSpeaking at the seminar in Geneva, Higgs commented \"It's really an incredible thing that it's happened in my lifetime.\"[12] Ironically, this probable confirmation of the Higgs boson was made at the same place where the editor of *Physics Letters* rejected Higgs' paper.[6]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honours[edit]\n\n\nHiggs has received numerous accolades including:\n\n\n\n### Civic awards[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Edinburgh Award handprints\nHiggs was the recipient of the Edinburgh Award for 2011. He is the fifth person to receive the Award, which was established in 2007 by the City of Edinburgh Council to honour an outstanding individual who has made a positive impact on the city and gained national and international recognition for Edinburgh.[45]\n\n\nHiggs was presented with an engraved loving cup by the Rt Hon George Grubb, Lord Provost of Edinburgh, in a ceremony held at the City Chambers on Friday 24 February 2012. The event also marked the unveiling of his handprints in the City Chambers quadrangle, where they had been engraved in Caithness stone alongside those of previous Edinburgh Award recipients.[46][47][48]\n\n\nHiggs was awarded with the Freedom of the City of Bristol in July 2013.[49] In April 2014, he was also awarded the Freedom of the City of Newcastle upon Tyne. He was also honoured with a brass plaque installed on the Newcastle Quayside as part of the Newcastle Gateshead Initiative Local Heroes Walk of Fame.\n\n\n\n### Higgs Centre for Theoretical Physics[edit]\n\n\nOn 6 July 2012, Edinburgh University announced a new centre named after Professor Higgs to support future research in theoretical physics. The Higgs Centre for Theoretical Physics brings together scientists from around the world to seek \"a deeper understanding of how the universe works\".[50] The centre is currently based within the James Clerk Maxwell Building, home of the University's School of Physics and Astronomy and the iGEM 2015 team (ClassAfiED). The university has also established a chair of theoretical physics in the name of Peter Higgs.[51][52]\n\n\n\n### Nobel Prize in Physics[edit]\n\n\nOn 8 October 2013, it was announced that Higgs and Fran\u00e7ois Englert would share the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for the theoretical discovery of a mechanism that contributes to our understanding of the origin of mass of subatomic particles\", and which recently was confirmed through the discovery of the predicted fundamental particle, by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at CERN\u2019s Large Hadron Collider\".[53] Higgs admits he had gone out to avoid the media attention[54] so he was informed he had been awarded the prize by an ex-neighbour on his way home, since he did not have a mobile phone.[55][56]\n\n\n\n### Companion of Honour[edit]\n\n\nHiggs turned down a knighthood in 1999, but in 2012 he accepted membership of The Order of the Companion of Honour.[57][58] He later said that he only accepted the order because he was wrongly assured that the award was the gift of the Queen alone. He also expressed cynicism towards the honours system, and the way the system \"is used for political purposes by the government in power\". The order confers no title or precedence, but recipients of the order are entitled to use the post-nominal letters CH*.* In the same interview he also stated that when people ask what the CH after his name stands for, he replies \"it means I'm an honorary Swiss.\"[59] He received the order from the Queen at an investiture at Holyrood House on 1 July 2014.[60]\n\n\n\n### Honorary Degrees[edit]\n\n\nHiggs has been awarded honorary degrees from the following institutions:\n\n\n\n* DSc University of Bristol 1997[61]\n* DSc University of Edinburgh 1998[61]\n* DSc University of Glasgow 2002[61]\n* DSc Swansea University 2008[61]\n* DSc King's College London 2009[61]\n* DSc University College London 2010[61]\n* DSc University of Cambridge 2012[61]\n* DSc Heriot-Watt University 2012[61]\n* PhD SISSA, Trieste 2013[61]\n* DSc University of Durham 2013[61]\n* DSc University of Manchester 2013[61]\n* DSc University of St Andrews 2014[61]\n* DSc Free University of Brussels (ULB) 2014[61]\n* DSc University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill 2015[61]\n* DSc Queen's University Belfast 2015[61]\n* ScD Trinity College Dublin 2016[61]\n\nA portrait of Higgs was painted by Ken Currie in 2008.[62] Commissioned by the University of Edinburgh,[63] it was unveiled on 3 April 2009[64] and hangs in the entrance of the James Clerk Maxwell Building of the School of Physics and Astronomy and the School of Mathematics.[62] A large portrait by Lucinda Mackay is in the collection of the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh. Another portrait of Higgs by the same artist hangs in the birthplace of James Clerk Maxwell in Edinburgh, Higgs is the Honorary Patron of the James Clerk Maxwell Foundation. A portrait by Victoria Crowe was commissioned by the Royal Society of Edinburgh and unveiled in 2013.[65]\n\n\n\n## Personal life and political views[edit]\n\n\nHiggs married Jody Williamson, a fellow activist with the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) in 1963. Their first son was born in August 1965.[66] Higgs's family includes two sons: Chris, a computer scientist, and Jonny, a jazz musician.[67] He has two grandchildren. The entire family lives in Edinburgh.[47]\n\n\nHiggs was an activist in the CND while in London and later in Edinburgh, but resigned his membership when the group extended its remit from campaigning against nuclear weapons to campaigning against nuclear power too.[23][68] He was a Greenpeace member until the group opposed genetically modified organisms.[68]\n\n\nHiggs was awarded the 2004 Wolf Prize in Physics (sharing it with Robert Brout and Fran\u00e7ois Englert), but he refused to fly to Jerusalem to receive the award because it was a state occasion attended by the then president of Israel, Moshe Katsav, and Higgs was opposed to Israel's actions in Palestine.[69]\n\n\nHiggs was actively involved in the Edinburgh University branch of the Association of University Teachers, through which he agitated for greater staff involvement in the management of the physics department.[59]\n\n\nHiggs is an atheist.[70] He has described Richard Dawkins as having adopted a \"fundamentalist\" view of non-atheists.[71] Higgs has expressed displeasure with the nickname the \"God particle\".[72] Although it has been reported that he believes the term \"might offend people who are religious\",[67] Higgs has stated that this is not the case, lamenting the letters he has received which claim the God particle was predicted in the Torah, the Qur'an and Buddhist scriptures. In a 2013 interview with Decca Aitkenhead, Higgs was quoted as saying:[73]\n\n\n\n\n> I'm not a believer. Some people get confused between the science and the theology. They claim that what happened at Cern proves the existence of God. The church in Spain has also been guilty of using that name as evidence for what they want to prove. [It] reinforces confused thinking in the heads of people who are already thinking in a confused way. If they believe that story about creation in seven days, are they being intelligent?\n> \n> \u2014\u200aThe Guardian, 6 Dec 2013\n> \n\n\nUsually this nickname for the Higgs boson is attributed to Leon Lederman, the author of the book *The God Particle: If the Universe Is the Answer, What Is the Question?*, but the name is the result of the suggestion of Lederman's publisher: Lederman had originally intended to refer to it as the \"goddamn particle\".[74]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Higgs, Peter Ware (1954). *Some problems in the theory of molecular vibrations*. *ethos.bl.uk* (PhD thesis).

In 2021, Akasaki, along with Shuji Nakamura, Nick Holonyak, M. George Craford and Russell D. Dupuis were awarded the Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering \"for the creation and development of LED lighting, which forms the basis of all solid state lighting technology\".[9]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nHe was born in Chiran, Kagoshima Prefecture and raised in Kagoshima City.[10][11] His elder brother is Masanori Akazaki\u00a0[ja] who was an electronic engineering researcher and a Professor Emeritus at Kyushu University.[11] (Their surname \"\u8d64\ufa11\" is also pronounced Akazaki.[12][13])\n\n\nIsamu graduated from Kagoshima Prefectural Daini-Kagoshima Middle School (now Kagoshima Prefectural Konan High School) in 1946, from Seventh Higher School Zoshikan (now Kagoshima University) in 1949[11] and from Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Kyoto University in 1952.[10] During his university years, he visited shrines and temples that local residents rarely visit, walked around the mountains of Shinshu during the summer vacation, enjoyed classes and enjoyed a fulfilling student era.[10] After he became a researcher, he obtained the degree of Doctor of Engineering from Nagoya University in 1964.[14]\n\n\n\n## Research[edit]\n\n\nAkasaki started working on GaN-based blue LEDs in the late 1960s. Step by step, he improved the quality of GaN crystals and device structures[15] at Matsushita Research Institute Tokyo, Inc. (MRIT), where he decided to adopt metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) as the preferred growth method for GaN.\n\n\nIn 1981 he started afresh the growth of GaN by MOVPE at Nagoya University, and in 1985 he and his group succeeded in growing high-quality GaN on sapphire substrate by pioneering the low-temperature (LT) buffer layer technology.[16][17]\n\n\nThis high-quality GaN enabled them to discover p-type GaN by doping with magnesium (Mg) and subsequent activation by electron irradiation (1989), to produce the first GaN p-n junction blue/UV LED (1989), and to achieve conductivity control of n-type GaN (1990)[18] and related alloys (1991)[19] by doping with silicon (Si), enabling the use of hetero structures and multiple quantum wells in the design and structure of more efficient p-n junction light emitting structures.\n\n\nThey achieved stimulated emission from the GaN firstly at room temperature in 1990,[20] and developed in 1995 the stimulated emission at 388\u00a0nm with pulsed current injection from high-quality AlGaN/GaN/GaInN quantum well device.[21] They verified quantum size effect (1991)[22] and quantum confined Stark effect (1997)[23] in nitride system, and in 2000 showed theoretically the orientation dependence of piezoelectric field and the existence of non-/semi-polar GaN crystals,[24] which have triggered today's worldwide efforts to grow those crystals for application to more efficient light emitters.\n\n\n\n## Nagoya University Akasaki Institute[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Later in 1964, he was the Head of Basic Research Laboratory at Matsushita Research Institute Tokyo, Inc. until 1974 to later become a General Manager of Semiconductor Department (in the same institute until 1981).[*citation needed*] In 1981 he became a professor in the Department of Electronics at Nagoya University until 1992.[26]\n\n\nFrom 1987 to 1990 he was a Project Leader of \"Research and Development of GaN-based Blue Light\u2013Emitting Diode\" sponsored by Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST). He then led the \"Research and Development of GaN-based \nShort-Wavelength Semiconductor Laser Diode\" product sponsored by JST from 1993 to 1999. While he led this project, he was also a visiting professor at the Research Center for Interface Quantum Electronics at Hokkaido University, from 1995 to 1996. In 1996 he was a Project Leader of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science's for the \"Future program\" up to 2001. From 1996 he started as a Project Leader of \"High-Tech Research Center for Nitride Semiconductors\" at Meijo University, sponsored by MEXT until 2004. From 2003 up to 2006 he was the Chairman of \"R&D Strategic Committee on the Wireless Devices Based on Nitride Semiconductors\" sponsored by METI.\n\n\nHe continued working as a Professor Emeritus of Nagoya University, Professor of Meijo University from 1992.[26] He was also the Director of the Research Center for Nitride Semiconductors at Meijo University since 2004. He also worked as a Research Fellow at Akasaki Research Center of Nagoya University from 2001.\n\n\n\n## Death[edit]\n\n\nAkasaki died of pneumonia, on April 1, 2021, aged 92.[27]\n\n\n\n## Honors and awards[edit]\n\n\n### Scientific and academic[edit]\n\n\n![](image)With Shuji Nakamura and Hiroshi Amano (at the Grand H\u00f4tel on December 8, 2014)\n* 1989 \u2013 Japanese Association for Crystal Growth (JACG) Award\n* 1991 \u2013 Chu-Nichi Culture Award[28]\n* 1994 \u2013 Technological Contribution Award, Japanese Association for Crystal Growth in commemoration of its 20th anniversary\n* 1995 \u2013 Heinrich Welker Gold Medal, the International Symposium on Compound Semiconductors\n* 1996 \u2013 Engineering Achievement Award, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers / Lasers Electro-Optics Society\n* 1998 \u2013 Inoue Harushige Award, Japan Science and Technology Agency\n* 1998 \u2013 C&C Prize, the Nippon Electric Company Corporation[29]\n* 1998 \u2013 Laudise Prize, the International Organization for Crystal Growth[30]\n* 1998 \u2013 Jack A.

For his work he was awarded the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physics together with Isamu Akasaki and Shuji Nakamura for \"the invention of efficient blue light-emitting diodes which has enabled bright and energy-saving white light sources\".[2]\n\n\nAmano was elected as a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 2016 for the development of p-type gallium nitride (GaN) doping, enabling blue semiconductor LEDs.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nAmano was born in Hamamatsu, Japan, on September 11, 1960. He received his BE, ME and DE degree in 1983, 1985 and 1989, respectively, from Nagoya University.\n\n\nDuring elementary school days, he played soccer as a goalkeeper and softball as a catcher. He was also passionate about amateur radio and despite hating studying, he was good at mathematics. Upon entering high school, he began taking his studies seriously and became a top student by studying every day late into the night.\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Blue light-emitting diodes\nFrom 1988 to 1992, he was a research associate at Nagoya University. In 1992, he moved to Meijo University, where he was an assistant professor. From 1998 to 2002, He was an associate professor. In 2002, he became a professor. In 2010, he moved to the Graduate School of Engineering, Nagoya University, where he is currently a professor.\n\n\nHe joined Professor Isamu Akasaki's group in 1982 as an undergraduate student. Since then, he has been doing research on the growth, characterization and device applications of group III nitride semiconductors, which are well known as materials used in blue light-emitting diodes today. In 1985, he developed low-temperature deposited buffer layers for the growth of group III nitride semiconductor films on a sapphire substrate, which led to the realization of group-III-nitride semiconductor based light-emitting diodes and laser diodes. In 1989, he succeeded in growing p-type GaN and fabricating a p-n-junction-type GaN-based UV/blue light-emitting diode for the first time in the world.\n\n\nKnown to be keen on research, Amano's laboratory was always lit late at night, such as weekdays, holidays, New Year's Day, and was called \"no night castle\".[3] According to his students in the laboratory, Amano has an optimistic and temperate personality, and is never angry.[4][5]\n\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\n![](image)with Shuji Nakamura and Isamu Akasaki (at the Grand H\u00f4tel on December 8, 2014)\n* 1994 \u2013 Fifth Optoelectronics Conference A Special Award\n* 1996 \u2013 IEEE/LEOS Engineering Achievement Award\n* 1998 \u2013 Japanese Journal of Applied Physics Award for the best review paper\n* 1998 \u2013 British Rank Prize\n* 2001 \u2013 Marubun Academic Award\n* 2002 \u2013 Takeda Award\n* 2003 \u2013 SSDM Award\n* 2004 \u2013 TITech\u7cbe\u5bc6\u5de5\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u6240\u7b2c1\u56deP\uff06I\u30d1\u30c6\u30f3\u30c8\u30fb\u30aa\u30d6\u30fb\u30b6\u30fb\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\n* 2008 \u2013 \u65e5\u672c\u7d50\u6676\u6210\u9577\u5b66\u4f1a\u8ad6\u6587\u8cde\n* 2014 \u2013 APEX/JJAP Editorial Contribution Award der Japan Society of Applied Physics\n* 2014 \u2013 Nobel Prize in Physics\n* 2015 \u2013 Chu-Nichi Culture Award\n* 2015 \u2013 Special Achievement Award, Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers\n* 2015 \u2013 Prizes for Science and Technology (Research Category) by the Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology\n* 2015 \u2013 \u7523\u5b66\u5b98\u9023\u643a\u529f\u52b4\u8005\u8868\u5f70\u65e5\u672c\u5b66\u8853\u4f1a\u8b70\u4f1a\u9577\u8cde\n* 2015 \u2013 Asia Game Changer Award[6]\n\n## Honors[edit]\n\n\n![](image)with Shinz\u014d Abe (at the Prime Minister's Official Residence on October 22, 2014)\n* 2009 \u2013 Fellow, Japan Society of Applied Physics\n* 2009 \u2013 Nistep (National Institute of Science and Technology Policy) Researcher from the Ministry of Education of Japan\n* 2011 \u2013 Fellow, Institute of Physics\n* 2014 \u2013 Person of Cultural Merit, the Japanese Government\n* 2014 \u2013 Order of Culture, the Japanese Emperor\n* 2015 \u2013 Honorary citizenship of Shizuoka prefecture\n* 2015 \u2013 Honorary citizenship of Hamamatsu City\n* 2015 \u2013 Aichi Prefecture Academic Honors\n* 2015 \u2013 Nagoya City Academic Honors\n* 2015 \u2013 Honorary Fellow, Japan Sweden Society\n* 2015 \u2013 Honorary citizenship of Aichi prefecture\n* 2015 \u2013 \u4e38\u516b\u4f1a\u9855\u5f70\n* 2016 \u2013 Foreign Member of the National Academy of Engineering[7]\n* 2019 - Foreign members of the Chinese Academy of Engineering\n* 2022 - Members of the Japan Academy[8]\n\n\n## Family[edit]\n\n\nAmano's wife is a Japanese lecturer at Comenius University in Bratislava, Slovakia.[9]\n\n\n\n## Selected publications[edit]\n\n\n* Amano, H.; Sawaki, N.; Akasaki, I.; Toyoda, Y.

In 2015, his input into commercialization and development of energy-efficient white LED lighting technology was recognized by the Global Energy Prize. In 2021, Nakamura, along with Akasaki, Nick Holonyak, M. George Craford and Russell D. Dupuis were awarded the Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering \"for the creation and development of LED lighting, which forms the basis of all solid state lighting technology\".[7]\n\n\n\n\n## Careers[edit]\n\n\nNakamura graduated from the University of Tokushima in 1977 with a B.Eng. degree in electronic engineering, and obtained an M.Eng. degree in the same subject two years later, after which he joined the Nichia Corporation, also based in Tokushima. It was while working for Nichia that Nakamura invented the method for producing the first commercial high brightness gallium nitride (GaN) LED whose brilliant blue light, when partially converted to yellow by a phosphor coating, is the key to white LED lighting, which went into production in 1993.\n\n\nPreviously, J.\u00a0I. Pankove and co-workers at RCA put in considerable effort, but did not manage to make a marketable GaN LED in the 1960s. The principal problem was the difficulty of making strongly p-type GaN.[8] Nakamura drew on the work of another Japanese group led by Professor Isamu Akasaki, who published their method to make strongly p-type GaN by electron-beam irradiation of magnesium-doped GaN; however, this method was not suitable for mass production. Nakamura managed to develop a thermal annealing method which was much more suitable for mass production.[9] In addition, he and his co-workers worked out the physics and pointed out the culprit was hydrogen, which passivated acceptors in GaN.[10]\n\n\nAt the time, many considered creating a GaN LED too difficult to produce; therefore Nakamura was fortunate that the founder of Nichia, Nobuo Ogawa\u00a0[ja](1912\u20132002), was willing to support and fund his GaN project.[11][12] However, the senior Ogawa ceded the presidency to his son-in-law Eiji Ogawa (in 1989), and the company under Eiji's direction ordered him to suspend work on GaN, claiming it was consuming too much time and money.[13][14] Nakamura continued to develop the blue LED on his own and in 1993 succeeded in making the device.[15][14]\n\n\nDespite these circumstances, once Nakamura succeeded in creating a commercially viable prototype, 3 orders of magnitude (1000 times) brighter than previously successful blue LEDs, Nichia pursued developing the marketable product.[11][16] The company's gross receipt surged from just over \u00a520 billion yen(\u2248US$200 million) in 1993 to \u00a580 billion(\u2248US$800 million) by 2001, 60 percent of which was accounted for by sales of blue LED products.[14] The company's workforce doubled between 1994 and 1999 from 640 to 1300 employees.[17]\n\n\nNakamura was awarded a D.Eng. degree from the University of Tokushima in 1994. He left Nichia Corporation in 1999 and took a position as a professor of engineering at the University of California, Santa Barbara.\n\n\nIn 2001, Nakamura sued his former employer Nichia over his bonus for the discovery as a part of a series of lawsuits between Nichia and Nakamura with Nichia's US competitor Cree Inc.; they agreed in 2000 to jointly sue Nichia at the expense of Cree and Nakamura received stock options from Cree. Nakamura claimed that he received only \u00a520,000 (\u2248US$180) for his discovery of \"404 patent,\" though Nichia's president Eiji Ogawa's side of the story was that he was shocked beyond belief that the court would award Nakamura \u00a520 billion, and downplaying the significance of the \"404 patent,\" opined that the company had adequately compensated him for the innovation through promotions and bonuses amounting to \u00a562 million over 11 years and annual salary which was raised to \u00a520 million by the time Nakamura quit Nichia.[18]\n\n\nNakamura sued for \u00a52 billion (<US$20 million) as his fair share for the invention, and the district court awarded him ten times the amount, \u00a520 billion (<US$200 million). However, Nichia appealed the award and the parties settled in 2005 for \u00a5840 million (\u2248US$8.1 million, less than 5% of the award amount), which was still the largest payment ever paid by a Japanese company to an employee for an invention;[19][20] an amount only enough to cover legal expenses incurred by Nakamura.[21]\n\n\nNakamura has also worked on green LEDs, and is responsible for creating the white LED and blue laser diodes used in Blu-ray Discs and HD DVDs.[22]\n\n\nNakamura is a professor of Materials at the University of California, Santa Barbara.[23] In 2008, Nakamura, along with fellow UCSB professors Dr. Steven DenBaars and Dr. James Speck, founded Soraa, a developer of solid-state lighting technology built on pure gallium nitride substrates.[24] Nakamura holds 208 US utility patents as of May 5, 2020.[25]\n\n\nIn November 2022, Nakamura co-founded Blue Laser Fusion, a commercial fusion company, with Hiroaki Ohta, a former president of Tokyo-based drone maker ACSL.[26] In July 2023, Blue Laser Fusion raised $25 million from venture capital firm JAFCO Group and the Mirai Creation Fund, which is backed by Toyota Motor and other investors and managed by the SPARX Group.[26]\n\n\n\n## Recognition[edit]\n\n\n* 2001 \u2013 Asahi Prize from the Japanese Newspaper, *Asahi Shimbun*\n* 2002 \u2013 Benjamin Franklin Medal in Physics from the Franklin Institute.\n* 2006 \u2013 Finland's Millennium Technology Prize for his continuing efforts to make cheaper and more efficient light sources.[27][28]\n* 2007 \u2013 nominee for the European Inventor Award awarded by the European Patent Office[29]\n* 2008 \u2013 Prince of Asturias Award for Technical and Scientific Research.[30]\n* 2008 \u2013 Honorary degree of Doctor of Engineering from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.\n* 2008 \u2013 Holst Memorial Lecture Award [Eindhoven University of Technology and Royal Philips Research, the Netherlands].\n* 2009 \u2013 Harvey Prize[31] from the Technion in Israel.\n* 2012 \u2013 Silicon Valley Intellectual Property Law Association (SVIPLA) Inventor of the Year.[32]\n* 2014 \u2013 Nobel Prize in Physics together with Prof. Isamu Akasaki and Prof. Hiroshi Amano for inventing blue light-emitting diodes.[33]\n* 2015 \u2013 Global Energy Prize for the invention, commercialization and development of energy-efficient white LED lighting technology [34]\n* 2015 \u2013 Asia Game Changer Award[35]\n* 2016 - Outstanding Achievement in Science & Technology at The Asian Awards[36]\n* 2017 \u2013 Mountbatten Medal[37]\n* 2018 \u2013 Zayed Future Energy Prize[38]\n* 2021 \u2013 Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering[39]\n* 2022 \u2013 Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement[40]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Japanese Nobel laureates\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\nCitations\n1. **^** \u7279\u8a31\u306f\u4f1a\u793e\u306e\u3082\u306e\u300c\u731b\u53cd\u5bfe\u300d \u30ce\u30fc\u30d9\u30eb\u8cde\u306e\u4e2d\u6751\u4fee\u4e8c\u3055\u3093 [Patent belongs to the company \"Violent opposition\" Nobel prize winner Shuji Nakamura] (in Japanese).
