In the case of jersey numbers, they are usually no longer available for future players to wear, although they can ask for permission from players whose jerseys are retired. Teams usually display these numbers by hanging banners on the rafters inside their home arena. As of 2022, only two teams in the NBA do not have any retired numbers: the Los Angeles Clippers and the Toronto Raptors. Two players have had their numbers retired by teams they did not play for, and only one player (Bill Russell) had his number retired league wide.\n\n\n\n\n## List[edit]\n\n\n**Key:**\n\n\n\n † \nInducted to the Basketball Hall of Fame\n ‡ \nNumber retired league-wide\n\n\nRetired NBA numbers\n| No.\n | Name\n | Team\n | Pos.\n | Years with franchise\n | Note\n | Refs\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 9 | Bob Pettit†\n | Atlanta Hawks | F | 1954–1965 | Did not play for franchise in Atlanta.

A Texas Mr. Basketball in high school, he played one season of college basketball for Georgia Tech before declaring for the 2003 NBA draft. Bosh was selected fourth overall by the Toronto Raptors.\n\n\nWhile at Toronto, Bosh became a five-time NBA All-Star, was named to the All-NBA Second Team once, played for the U.S. national team (with whom he won a gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics), and supplanted former fan favorite Vince Carter as the face and leader of the Raptors franchise. In the 2006–07 season, Bosh led the Raptors to their first playoff appearance in five years and their first-ever division title. He left Toronto in 2010 as the franchise's all-time leader in points, rebounds, blocks, and minutes played.[1]\n\n\nIn 2010, after seven seasons with the Raptors, Bosh entered into a sign-and-trade deal whereby he was traded to the Miami Heat.[2] In Miami, he joined fellow stars Dwyane Wade and LeBron James; the trio became known as the Big Three. Bosh spent the second half of his career with Miami, appearing in the NBA Finals each year from 2011 to 2014 and winning NBA titles in 2012 and 2013. He made the NBA All-Star team every year during his time in Miami. Bosh's career was cut short by a blood clotting condition that the NBA ruled to be a career-ending illness.[3][4] He played his final NBA game on February 9, 2016.[5] Notwithstanding the NBA's ruling, Bosh fought to resume his playing career for three years[6] before announcing in February 2019 that he intended to retire.[7] The same year, the Heat retired his No. 1 jersey.[8][9] In 2021, Bosh was elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame.[10]\n\n\nSeeking to promote sports and education amongst youths in Dallas and Toronto, Bosh set up the Chris Bosh Foundation and regularly speaks to youths about the benefits of reading.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nBorn to Noel and Freida Bosh in Dallas, Texas,[11] Bosh was raised in Hutchins, a suburb of the city.[12] A family-oriented person, Bosh would often play basketball in the house with his younger brother, Joel.[13] At the early age of four years old, he started learning how to dribble a basketball in the gym where his father played pick-up games.[14] Since Bosh was always tall for his age, he was accustomed to out-rebounding his peers whenever he played;[15] but he only started learning the game of basketball seriously around fourth grade, doing so at a playground near his grandmother's house.[13]\n\n\nAs a child, Bosh participated in karate and gymnastics.[16] He also played baseball up until high school, chiefly as a first baseman according to his preference.[13]\n\n\nGrowing up, Bosh names his parents as the biggest influence on his personality and considers NBA superstar Kevin Garnett as his favorite athlete, after whom he modeled his play.[15] Academically, Bosh always excelled in school[17] as he was a member of the National Honor Society and several student engineering organizations.[16]\n\n\nBosh began garnering significant attention from college recruiters after he led Lincoln High School in Dallas to the number one ranking in the country and to the *USA Today* National Championship with a perfect 40–0 season.[18]\n\n\nThe 6-foot-11 teenager helped Lincoln High capture the Class 4A state title as he delivered 23 points and 17 rebounds to go along with 9 blocks. Bosh was subsequently named High School Player of the Year by Basketball America; Powerade Player of the Year in Texas; a first-team All-American by *Parade*, McDonald's, and EA Sports; a second-team all-American by *USA Today* and *SLAM* Magazine; a first-team all-state player; and \"Mr. Basketball\" in Texas by the Texas Association of Basketball Coaches.[18] With his combination of grades and basketball skills, Bosh's name was on a number of college recruiting lists. The University of Florida and University of Memphis among them made serious overtures, but it was Paul Hewitt, coach of Georgia Tech, who made the best impression. Bosh felt that Hewitt had his best interests at heart and respected his aspiration to play professionally; moreover, he was sufficiently impressed by what he saw of Georgia Tech's transition offense.[17]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\nBosh eventually chose to follow the footsteps of his cousin and aunt and attended Georgia Tech to study graphic design and computer imaging, and subsequently, management.[13] There, he led the Yellow Jackets in averaging 15.6 points, 9.0 rebounds and 2.2 blocks in 31 games, and led the Atlantic Coast Conference in field goal percentage (.560), joining Antawn Jamison as the only freshmen ever to do so.[11] Bosh originally intended to complete his degree, but by the end of the 2002–03 season, his strong performances convinced him that he was ready for the NBA.[17] He left Georgia Tech after his freshman season[11] and entered the 2003 NBA draft. Bosh said in future interviews that although he misses his college days, he believes he made the right decision to pursue a professional career.[15]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Toronto Raptors (2003–2010)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bosh shooting a free throw during a game in the 2005–06 season\n#### Rookie year (2003–2004)[edit]\n\n\nIn what is widely regarded as one of the strongest draft classes in NBA history, which included future All-Stars LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, and Dwyane Wade,[17] Bosh was selected fourth overall by the Toronto Raptors in the 2003 NBA draft and was signed on July 8, 2003.[19] Prior to his signing, however, other NBA teams made offers for Bosh as they knew Toronto needed a veteran scorer, and Raptors star Vince Carter himself pressed for a trade. General Manager Glen Grunwald turned everyone down.[17]\n\n\nIn his rookie season, Bosh was forced to play out of position as the Raptors' starting center after Antonio Davis was traded to the Chicago Bulls.[20] Night after night, the teenager with the \"slim frame\" battled against opponents who had a significant size and strength advantage over him.[20] Bosh—who cited teammate Michael Curry as his mentor[15]—was often praised by his coaches for his heart, and willingness to play through pain and injuries resulting from his lack of body strength compared to some of the league's strong forwards and centers.[21] Bosh's contributions were not unnoticed by teammates either,[22] as he averaged 11.5 points, 7.4 rebounds, 1.4 blocks, and 33.5 minutes in 75 games, leading all rookies in rebounding and blocks, and setting a franchise record for most rebounds in a rookie season with 557.[11] Bosh was rewarded by being selected to the NBA All-Rookie First Team for the 2003–04 season.[11]\n\n\n\n#### Heralded as the new hope (2004–2006)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bosh and his teammates in a 2005–06 game against the Milwaukee Bucks. From left: Pape Sow, Bosh, Mike James and Morris Peterson.\nWith the departure of the disenchanted franchise face of the team, Vince Carter, in December 2004, Bosh was simultaneously anointed as the new leader around whom Toronto would build.[23] In the remaining games following Carter's departure, the power forward averaged 18.4 points, 9.5 rebounds, 1.6 blocks, and 38.1 minutes per game, improving in every major statistical category.[11] He was awarded his first ever NBA Eastern Conference Player of the Week for games played between January 3 and 9, 2005.[11] As the season drew to a close, analysts predicted that Bosh would become an All-Star one day.[24][25] Bosh ended the 2004–05 season as the leading scorer and leading rebounder for the team on 21 and 46 occasions respectively.[11]\n\n\nPrior to the 2005–06 season, Bosh was named as one of Toronto's team captains. Bosh continued to work on his game as he consistently chalked up double-doubles, leading the team in scoring, rebounding, and field goal percentage for the first half of the season.[26] On February 9, 2006, for the first time in his career, Bosh was selected to play in the 2006 NBA All-Star Game in Houston, Texas as a reserve forward for the Eastern Conference.[11] He was only the third Raptor to make an All-Star game, after Carter and Antonio Davis. Bosh's selection was just three days after he was named NBA Eastern Conference Player of the Week for the second time in his career.[26] In March 2006, following a season-ending injury to Bosh,[27] the Raptors hit a 1–10 skid.[28] This highlighted Bosh's importance as the centerpiece of the offense, as well as the leader of the team. The Raptors finished the season 27–55 and Bosh averaged 22.5 points, 9.2 rebounds, and 2.6 assists per game.[29]\n\n\n\n#### Leader of the division champions (2006–2007)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bosh improved his numbers in ppg and rpg in the 2006–07 season and had to lead a vastly different team from the 2005–06 roster.\nDespite a major off-season revamp of the Raptors roster—including the departure of good friends Mike James and Charlie Villanueva—Bosh officially signed a three-year contract extension with a player option for a fourth year on July 14, 2006.[30][31] The deal was reportedly worth US$65 million over four years.[32] Upon signing the contract, Bosh said \"I think the future is very positive for the franchise... change was needed... we have a lot of guys who just want to win and are willing to work hard.\"[32] During the same press conference, Bosh also announced a donation of $1 million to a Toronto charity, known as Community Legacy Programs.[30]\n\n\nAfter a shaky start to the Raptors' 2006–07 campaign, the Raptors managed to surpass the .500 mark as the All-Star break approached.[33] Bosh's play and leadership were pivotal to this run and as an increasing recognition of his abilities, on January 25, 2007, he was named an All-Star starter for the East in the 2007 NBA All-Star Game. Bosh received the second highest number of votes among all Eastern Conference forwards.[34] This was his first All-Star start and second overall All-Star appearance, having averaged over 22 points and 11 rebounds in the first half of the season.[34] On January 31, 2007, in a game against the Washington Wizards, Bosh scored a 65-foot (20 m) buzzer-beating shot to end the third quarter of the game.[35] He shot 15-of-15 after missing his first four shots.[36] Bosh's in-form streak enabled him to be selected Eastern Conference Player of the Month for January 2007.[37] He had averaged 25.4 points and 9.1 rebounds while leading the Raptors to a 10–5 record in that month. On February 7, 2007, Bosh's career-high 41 points prompted the home fans to chant \"MVP\"—an unprecedented event in the Air Canada Centre.[38] Two days later, Bosh collected 29 points and 11 rebounds against the Los Angeles Lakers, shooting 10-of-10 in the second half.[39]\n\n\nOn March 28, 2007, Bosh became the new franchise record holder for double-doubles in a home win against the Miami Heat.[40] He was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week for the third time in his career shortly after,[41] having led Toronto to clinch a playoff berth for the first time in five years. Toronto went on to win its first ever division title, and concluded the regular season with a 47–35 record, including a 30–11 home record, both franchise records.[42] As third seed, the Raptors played sixth seed New Jersey Nets in the first round of the 2007 NBA playoffs. The series drew much media attention as Carter, who had left Toronto under acrimonious circumstances, was back at the ACC as a Net.[43] Toronto's inexperience was evident as they struggled offensively throughout the game, to eventually lose 96–91.[43] The Raptors won game 2 at the ACC to tie the series 1–1, as Bosh recorded 25 points and a game-high 13 rebounds.[44] The Nets won Games 3 and 4 to lead 3–1, but Toronto forced game 6 when they narrowly won 98–96 in game 5.[45] The Nets went on to clinch the series with a win in game 6.[46] Bosh averaged a double-double with 22.6 ppg and 10.7 rpg for the regular season, both career-highs, and posted 17.5 ppg and 9.0 rpg for the playoffs.[29] He was named to the All-NBA Second Team at the end of the 2006–07 campaign.[47]\n\n\n\n#### Struggles (2007–2009)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bosh in 2007\nBefore the 2007–08 season began, Andrea Bargnani, the number one pick in the 2006 NBA draft, was slated to start at center and Bosh at power forward to form a strong Toronto frontcourt and Jason Kapono, a three-point specialist, was acquired via free agency from the Miami Heat to add offensive firepower; however, as the season unfolded, neither plans materialized as hoped.[48] Bosh himself had a slow start to the season, but as mid-season approached, his form picked up and he was named Player of the Week for the second week of January.[49] On January 31, 2008, he was selected to be on the Eastern Conference team for the 2008 NBA All-Star Game.[50] Bosh missed 15 games throughout the season, but the Raptors still managed to conclude the regular season with a 41–41 record, thus clinching the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference for the 2008 NBA playoffs. However, they were defeated by the Orlando Magic in the first round, losing 4–1.[51]\n\n\nThe first-round series against the Magic was touted as the matchup between two of the league's best young big men in Bosh and Dwight Howard.[52] Howard dominated throughout the series, while Bosh had a series-best effort in game 4 with 39 points and 15 rebounds.[53] General Manager Bryan Colangelo said at a press conference after the series, \"Whether it's protecting [Bosh] inside the paint, getting a little bit more of a presence in there, to just getting him another scorer that's going to shoulder some of that burden, it's something that's clear we have to get better\", hinting that the roster was in need of an overhaul.[54] Bosh said after the loss, \"They played a great series, they executed on offence and defense better than we did and when it came to the small things, they did a better job... I can't sit here and bark in protest that the better team didn't win. That's pretty obvious. They beat us pretty good.\"[51] Unlike the previous campaign, Bosh was not named to any of the All-NBA teams.[55]\n\n\nTo provide Bosh with an experienced frontcourt partner, the Raptors pulled a blockbuster trade prior to the 2008–09 campaign: six-time All-Star Jermaine O'Neal was acquired from the Indiana Pacers.[56] Bosh—who had won an Olympic gold medal with the national team at Beijing 2008—started the season strong. He averaged 26 points, 10 rebounds and 3.7 assists in his first three games and was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week for the fifth time in his career.[57] A week later, he became Toronto's all-time leader in offensive rebounds, surpassing Antonio Davis's record.[58] While Bosh and O'Neal formed a formidable partnership in the frontcourt, the Raptors struggled to surpass the .500 mark. The principal deficiency of previous campaigns—wing players—continued to upend Toronto's progress.[59] With the Raptors at 8–9, head coach Sam Mitchell was sacked and replaced by Jay Triano.[60] Despite the move, injuries and weaknesses in the roster meant that the Raptors entered the All-Star break 13 games under .500.[61] On January 29, 2009, Bosh was named an All-Star reserve,[62] but an injury ruled him out of the game. Two weeks later, in a bid to bring in a wing player and create greater salary flexibility, O'Neal and Jamario Moon were traded to Miami for Shawn Marion and Marcus Banks.[61] The trade did not improve the team's win–loss record, however, and the Raptors were eliminated from contention with seven games of the regular season remaining.[63] The bright spark in Bosh's campaign was his career-high 22.7 points per game, as well as his being one of two players in the league that season (the other being Dwight Howard) to average a 20/10 in points and rebounds.[64] On April 20, 2009, Colangelo announced that he would offer Bosh a contract extension during the summer,[65] which Bosh later refused to sign.[66]\n\n\n\n#### Overhauling the roster (2009–2010)[edit]\n\n\nTo prepare for the 2009–10 season, Bosh worked out under Ken Roberson, looking to add 20 pounds (9 kg) and bring his weight up to 250 lb (110 kg).[66] Following the failure of the 2008–09 campaign, Colangelo knew that he had to shake up the roster to persuade Bosh to stay, and the Raptors were one of the busiest teams in the pre-season market.[67] They opened their season with a win against the heavily favored Cleveland Cavaliers, in which Bosh scored 21 points and pulled down 16 rebounds.[68] Bosh went on a tear, averaging 25.4 points and 11.9 rebounds in the first 16 games, but the Raptors were only able to win seven of those games.[68][69] The Raptors crossed into 2010 with a 16–17 record, and on January 3, 2010, Bosh overtook Vince Carter as Toronto's all-time leader in total points scored.[70] After pulling together a string of wins, Toronto were .500 after 40 games. Bosh was the league leader in double-doubles at the time, being only one of two players in the league who averaged at least 20 points and 10 rebounds a game.[71] On January 20, 2010, he scored a career-high 44 points in a loss against the Milwaukee Bucks, while collecting his 220th career double-double.[72] That same month, Bosh was named a reserve for the Eastern Conference All-Star team,[73] and was Eastern Conference Player of the Week.[74] After the All-Star break, the Raptors went on several losing streaks and an injury to Bosh exacerbated the situation. As the regular season came to a close, the Raptors went from being the fifth seed before the All-Star break to fighting for the eighth and final playoff spot with the Chicago Bulls. After recording his 44th double-double on March 22, 2010, Bosh became the Raptors' all-time leader in number of double-doubles in a season. On April 5, 2010, he was named the Eastern Conference Player of the Week, winning the honor for the seventh time in his career (tying Carter for the most in franchise history).[75] However, Bosh was unable to play in a pivotal match against the Bulls on April 11, 2010. The blowout loss cost Toronto their tie-breaker and ultimately the eighth seed, as the Bulls finished with 41 wins to Toronto's 40.[76]\n\n\n\n### Miami Heat (2010–2017)[edit]\n\n\n#### Joining the Heat and debut season (2010–2011)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bosh in 2010\nAfter the 2009–10 season was over, there was much speculation over whether coveted free agents such as LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Bosh would sign with new teams for the 2010–11 season. Bosh was active on the social media front, posting his thoughts on Twitter and having a documentary crew record his meetings with the teams interested in signing him. Bosh signed with the Miami Heat on July 10, 2010, through a sign-and-trade deal, which sent two 2011 first-round draft picks to the Raptors (Norris Cole and Jonas Valančiūnas were later selected).[77][78] Bosh was a part of the first player-created NBA superteam.[79] Bosh's parting message to the Raptors on his website said, \"[K]now that this was my toughest decision, mostly because Toronto has been so great to me. I've loved every minute here and I just wanted to thank you from the bottom of my heart...\"[80] Not only did Bosh leave Toronto as its all-time leader in virtually all major statistical categories, he was one of only three players in the league who accrued 10,000 points, 4,500 rebounds, and 600 blocks in his seven seasons with the Raptors.[81]\n\n\nDespite being widely tipped as contenders, the Heat got off to a tentative 9–8 start. The Heat managed to go on to compile a 21–1 record, however, and were jostling with the Boston Celtics and Chicago Bulls for pole position in the Eastern Conference as mid-season approached.[82] Miami finished the regular season with 58 wins and faced Philadelphia in the first round of the playoffs. Miami won the series in five games, and also prevailed in five games in the semi-finals against Boston. In the Conference Finals against Chicago, Bosh was particularly instrumental, averaging 23.2 points in the 4–1 series win. He was slow off the blocks in the Finals against Dallas, shooting below .300 in the first two games, but scored the winning shot in game 3 to give Miami a 2–1 lead. That was the last game Miami won, as Dallas won the next three to win its first-ever championship. Bosh was seen sobbing as he walked to the locker room following the loss.\n\n\n\n#### Consecutive NBA championships (2011–2013)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bosh in a layup line before a game against the Dallas Mavericks in 2012\nOn January 5, 2012, Bosh led the Heat to a 116–109 triple-overtime win against the Atlanta Hawks, highlighted by a three-point shot he made to force the game into overtime with 0.6 seconds left to play in the fourth quarter. Bosh finished the game with 33 points, 14 rebounds, 5 assists, 2 steals, and 2 blocked shots.[83] By season's end, the Heat had embraced a small-ball strategy that featured Bosh at the center position. In the playoffs, Bosh averaged 14.0 points and 7.8 rebounds a game. In game 1 of the Conference Semi-finals against the Indiana Pacers, he suffered a lower abdominal strain that forced him to miss the rest of the series and the first four games of the Eastern Conference Finals against Boston. Bosh returned in the Conference Finals against the Celtics. He was moved to center for the remainder of the playoffs, while James, who had filled in at power forward during his absence, remained at that position.[84][85] Boston pushed Miami to seven games, and in the final game, Bosh scored 19 points, including 3-of-4 shooting from three-point range, to help the Heat advance to their second straight NBA Finals, this time against the Oklahoma City Thunder. The Thunder won the first game of the series before Miami rolled to a 4–1 victory, giving Bosh his first NBA championship. Bosh scored 24 points in the deciding game 5 and averaged 14.6 points and 9.4 rebounds in the Finals.\n\n\nBosh remained the Heat's starting center during the 2012–13 season. On February 15, 2013, Bosh was picked as an All-Star starter over the injured Rajon Rondo by coach Erik Spoelstra.[86] The Heat achieved the league's best record and swept through the first round of the playoffs against the Milwaukee Bucks before defeating the Chicago Bulls in five games, with Bosh scoring 20 points to go with 19 rebounds in a crucial game 3 win in Chicago. Bosh averaged 12.1 points per game throughout the playoffs, as the Heat advanced to the NBA Finals to face the San Antonio Spurs following a grueling seven-game series against Indiana. The Heat and Spurs split the first two games before the Spurs blew out Miami in game 3 to take a 2–1 series lead. In game 4, Bosh scored 20 points and grabbed 13 rebounds to complement Wade's 32 points and James's 33 points to bolster the Heat's win, tying the series. San Antonio would bounce back in game 5 to force the Heat to win the final two games at home. In the final seconds of game 6, James missed a three-pointer, and Bosh grabbed the offensive rebound and found a wide-open Ray Allen in the corner. Allen hit the shot to tie the game, and in overtime the Heat had a three-point lead with seconds left. San Antonio inbounded the ball to Danny Green, who attempted a corner three, but Green's shot was blocked by Bosh to secure the Heat's victory. Bosh was held scoreless in game 7 by Tim Duncan, but the Heat still won the game and the series to claim their second consecutive NBA championship.[87]\n\n\n\n#### Coming up short (2013–2014)[edit]\n\n\nIn the 2013–14 season, Bosh played and started in 79 games, averaging 16.2 points and 6.6 rebounds per game. He also hit a career-high 74 three-point shots on 33 percent shooting from beyond the arc. In the playoffs, Bosh helped the Heat return to the NBA Finals, where they faced the San Antonio Spurs once again. This time, however, the Heat were outclassed by the Spurs, as they lost the series in five games.\n\n\n\n#### Post-Big Three era (2014–2016)[edit]\n\n\nOn July 30, 2014, after wide speculation that he would join the Houston Rockets, Bosh re-signed with the Heat to a five-year, $118 million contract after LeBron James announced he was leaving Miami to return to the Cleveland Cavaliers.[88][89] After averaging 21.6 points, 8.2 rebounds, 2.1 assists and 1.1 steals over the first 23 games of the 2014–15 season, Bosh was ruled out indefinitely on December 15 with a strained calf.[90] He went on to miss eight games before returning on December 29 against the Orlando Magic.[91] After playing in the 2015 All-Star Game, Bosh was admitted to a Miami hospital for lung tests during the All-Star break.[92][93] On February 21, 2015, he was ruled out for the remainder of the season due to a blood clot in one of his lungs.[94]\n\n\nOn October 28, 2015, Bosh made his return to the court in the Heat's season opener against the Charlotte Hornets, recording 21 points and 10 rebounds in a 104–94 win.[95] On November 10, 2015, he scored a then season-high 30 points in a 101–88 win over the Los Angeles Lakers.[96] On December 28, 2015, he recorded 24 points and 12 rebounds against the Brooklyn Nets, and hit a career-best 5-of-5 from three-point range.[97] On January 4, 2016, he recorded a season-high 31 points and 11 rebounds in a 103–100 overtime win over the Indiana Pacers.[98] Though he was voted to play in the 2016 NBA All-Star Game, and selected to compete in the Three-Point Contest, due to a calf injury, Bosh was forced to withdraw from both.[99]\n\n\nA blood clot in his leg again forced Bosh to miss time following the 2016 All-Star break. He faced increasing pressure from physicians and the Heat organization to sit out the rest of the season because of the potential dangers of the recurring medical condition.[100] Following the Heat's February 9 game against San Antonio, Bosh did not play any regular-season or playoff games for Miami in 2016.[3][101][102] On May 4, 2016, the Heat announced that Bosh would be held out for the remainder of the playoffs.[3]\n\n\n\n#### Comeback attempts and retirement (2016–2019)[edit]\n\n\nBosh was initially optimistic about a return to the Heat for the 2016–17 season, and the organization had become increasingly hopeful that he would be cleared for camp. Those hopes quickly faded due to Bosh's continued issues with blood clotting.[103] In September 2016, Bosh failed his physical exam and was not cleared by the team to participate in training camp.[104] On September 26, 2016, Heat president Pat Riley said that the team viewed Bosh's career with the team as over.[105] In May 2017, Bosh and the Heat reportedly reached a unique agreement in which Bosh would leave the Heat without his salary taking up the team's salary cap space for the 2017–18 season.[106]\n\n\nOn June 2, 2017, the NBA ruled that Bosh's blood clotting issues were a career-ending illness, meaning the Heat would be allowed to remove his contract from their salary cap once they officially released him.[4] Two days later, the Heat announced that they had waived Bosh, ending a seven-year stint with the organization.[107] Following Bosh's release, Heat President Pat Riley said, \"The number '1' will never be worn by another player and we can't wait to someday hang his jersey in the rafters\".[108] In February 2018, Bosh declared himself on the comeback trail, having refused to rule out a return to the NBA.[6][109]\n\n\nOn February 12, 2019, Bosh announced that he was no longer pursuing his NBA career[110] and that he planned to retire from the NBA when his jersey was retired by the Heat.[111] The Heat retired Bosh's No. 1 jersey on March 26 before a regular season game against the Orlando Magic.[8][9]\n\n\n\n## NBA career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n|   GP\n | Games played\n |   GS \n | Games started\n |  MPG \n | Minutes per game\n |\n|

when he was selected as a member of the 2002 USA Basketball Junior World Championship Qualifying Team that finished with a 4–1 record and the bronze medal.[112]\n\n\nAfter his NBA career began, Bosh was named in March 2006 to the 2006–2008 United States men's national basketball team program, and helped lead the team to a 5–0 record during its pre-World Championship tour.[112] In August 2006, Bosh was named as a member of the 2006 USA World Championship Team.[112] Together with fellow 2003 draftees Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, and Kirk Hinrich, this team competed in the 2006 FIBA World Championship. The team won the bronze medal, defeating former 2004 Olympic champion Argentina.[113] Bosh was ranked sixth in field goal percentage.[112]\n\n\nFollowing the 2006–07 season, Bosh was named to the team that would compete in the 2007 FIBA Americas Championship. However, he sustained a foot injury and withdrew from the squad.[114] On June 23, 2008, he was named to the team that would compete in the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing.[115] During the tournament itself, Bosh operated as the main backup to center Dwight Howard as Team USA went unbeaten in all eight games en route to the gold medal, defeating Spain in the final.[116] He averaged 9.1 points per game, and led the team in rebounds with 6.1 a game.[117]\n\n\nIn June 2012, Bosh withdrew his name from consideration for the 2012 Olympics in London to recover from a lower abdominal strain that kept him out of some playoff games.[118]\n\n\n\n## Player profile[edit]\n\n\n> \n> You are not going to see a whole lot of screaming and hollering at guys... He is a guy that is going to pull somebody aside and say it in a positive way, and I think it goes a lot farther that way.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nAnthony Parker on Bosh's leadership[119]\n\n![](image)The mid-range jump shot was one of Bosh's trademark moves.\nBosh traditionally played the power forward position, including during his first season with the Miami Heat. However, starting in the 2011–12 season, he began to start at center and played the position during the team's consecutive championships. Listed at 6 feet 11 inches (2.11 m) and 235 pounds (107 kg),[29] Bosh possessed excellent speed, athleticism, and ball handling for a player of his size.[120] He was particularly noted for his ability to drive to the basket and finish strong or get to the free throw line—where he was also proficient, but he was also known for his well-developed jump shot.[121] Indiana Pacers coach Jim O'Brien once commented on the match-up problems Bosh posed for opposing defenders: \"We've tried over the years to put big guys on him. It doesn't work. We've tried to put small guys on him. It doesn't seem to work either. I don't know if we have somebody to play Bosh, to tell you the truth.\"[122] When he was the centerpiece of the Raptors' offense, Bosh was often double teamed, and he was noted to unselfishly pass the ball to teammates who were in better shooting positions.[123] He improved his shooting range when he worked on his three-point shooting during the summer of 2006 and showed improvement in the 2006–07 season. On November 8, 2006, against the Philadelphia 76ers, he hit a game-winning three-point shot with 6.1 seconds left.[124] It was reminiscent of the shot that marked his \"arrival\" to the NBA in his first season, when he hit a game-tying three-pointer against Houston to send the game to overtime.[11] When the 2006–07 season concluded, Bosh had shot .343 from the three-point arc for the season; he improved to .400 the following season.[29] Because of his ability to hit three-pointers, it was during his tenure with the Miami Heat that he began to be relied upon as one of the team's outside shooters, taking multiple three-pointers throughout the 2012 and 2013 championship runs. During the 2013–14 season, Bosh shot and made more three-pointers than at any point during his career, and continued to make crucial shots during the playoffs.\n\n\nBosh was noted for his leadership. When he was the leader of the Raptors, he was not known for being vocal on the court, preferring to maintain his quiet and humble demeanor but expecting his teammates to match his work ethic.[121] However, Bosh was also known to deliver stern rebukes to teammates who made bad calls on the court.[125] Throughout his career, comparisons were made between him and Kevin Garnett due to their similar style of play and physique.\n\n\n\n## Honors and achievements[edit]\n\n\n* **NBA Eastern Conference Player of the Month**: January 2007\n* **9× NBA Eastern Conference Player of the Week**: January 3, 2005; January 30, 2006; March 26, 2007; January 7, 2008; October 28, 2008; February 1, 2010; April 5, 2010; December 23, 2013; October 28, 2014\n* **NBA Atlantic Division champion**: 2007\n* **4× NBA Southeast Division champion**: 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n* **2× NBA champion**: 2012, 2013\n* **11× NBA All-Star**: 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016\n* **All-NBA Second Team**: 2007\n* **NBA All-Rookie Team**: 2004\n* **2× NBA Rookie All-Star Game**: 2004, 2005\n* **3× NBA Shooting Stars champion** (with Swin Cash and Dominique Wilkins) 2013, 2014, 2015[126]\n* Bronze medal winner with Team USA at the 2006 FIBA World Championship\n* Gold medal winner with Team USA at the 2008 Summer Olympics\n* Third-youngest player in NBA history to record 1,000 rebounds[11]\n* Fourth-youngest player in NBA history to record 20 points and 20 rebounds in a game[11]\n* Toronto's first player to achieve 10,000 points\n* Toronto's all-time leader in rebounds[58]\n* Toronto's all-time leader in defensive rebounds[58]\n* Toronto's all-time leader in offensive rebounds[58]\n* Toronto's all-time leader in rebounds per game\n* Toronto's all-time leader in rebounds per game in a season\n* Toronto's all-time leader in blocks\n* Toronto's all-time leader in free throws made[127]\n* Toronto's all-time leader in free throws made in a season\n* Toronto's all-time leader in free throws attempted[127]\n* Toronto's all-time leader in free throws attempted in a season\n* Toronto's all-time leader in double-doubles[40]\n* Toronto's all-time leader in double-doubles in a season\n* NBA Sportsmanship Award (divisional winner): 2007–08[128]\n* Elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame\n\n\n## Off the court[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bosh at the 2007 MuchMusic Video Awards\nBesides his on-the-court exploits, Bosh was a National Honor Society member and graduated with honors from Lincoln.[14] He is also a member of the National Society of Black Engineers and the Dallas Association of Minority Engineers.[14] Following his success in the NBA, Bosh soon had his own YouTube channel,[129] and has since made various TV appearances. In December 2009, First Ink, a DVD featuring comedic digital shorts and a documentary about Bosh, was released. The DVD was filmed during the summer of 2009.[130] A fan of the *X-Men* television series as a child, Bosh voiced the Marvel Comics character Heimdall in an episode of *Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.* in 2014.[131][132] He also made appearances on episodes of *Entourage* and *Parks and Recreation*.[133]\n\n\nIn the field of philanthropy, Bosh established the Chris Bosh Foundation in 2004. Remembering the challenges he faced as a youth,[14] Bosh founded the organization to help younger people in academics and athletics.[134] The Foundation, with programs in Toronto and Dallas, has worked closely with organizations such as the Toronto Special Olympics to raise important funding for community projects.[14] Bosh's mother, Freida, has served as CEO of the Foundation.[134] As an avid reader, Bosh also regularly speaks to groups of children about the benefits of reading,[12] and has received the NBA Community Assist Award for his active contributions for the Raptors community development program in Toronto and Dallas during the course of the NBA campaign.[135] In November 2008, Bosh pledged to donate $75,000 to the Boys and Girls Clubs of Canada.[136] He is also an advocate for increased computer literacy in schools, supporting the non-profit code.org.[137]\n\n\nOn April 9, 2011, Bosh married Adrienne Williams.[138][139] They renewed their vows on July 16, 2011.[140] The couple have five children, three sons and two daughters.[141][142]\n\n\nBosh has dabbled in hip-hop production. In 2017, alongside record producer, songwriter, and singer Rico Love, Bosh co-produced a song titled \"Miss My Woe\" by Gucci Mane.[143] The song is featured on Gucci's 11th studio album titled, *Mr. Davis*.\n\n\nIn June 2021, Bosh published his book, *Letters to a Young Athlete.*[144][145][146]\n\n\n\n### Paternity lawsuit[edit]\n\n\nOn March 24, 2009, it was reported that Bosh's former girlfriend, Allison Mathis, was seeking child support and sole custody of their daughter, Trinity (born November 2, 2008). Mathis alleged that when she was seven months pregnant, Bosh stopped supporting her financially and tried to remove her from their home.[147] Three days later, it was reported that the dispute was only over the amount Bosh paid.[148] Mathis' lawyer also told the press, \"My client very much wanted this dispute to remain private. Certainly this thing did not get started by anything on our side... She is very distressed that somehow this thing got into the newspapers. She wants Trinity to have a good relationship with her dad, Chris Bosh, and adverse publicity makes that more difficult.\"[148]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Sports portal\n\n\n* Toronto Raptors accomplishments and records\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Chiari, Mike. \"Chris Bosh on NBA Career: 'I've Made the Decision Not to Pursue It Anymore'\". *Bleacher Report*.

Wade credited Tragil as the person most responsible for pointing him in the right direction.[14] Wade grew up idolizing Michael Jordan and modeled his game after him.[15] On October 14, 2001, as Wade's basketball career blossomed, JoLinda vowed to turn her life around. She says that she has not used drugs since 2003.[16]\n\n\n\n## High school career[edit]\n\n\nWade played basketball and football for Harold L. Richards High School in Oak Lawn. He immediately excelled as a wide receiver and also played as a backup quarterback, but success in basketball took longer.[14] He grew four inches by the start of his junior year and emerged as the team leader, averaging 20.7 points and 7.6 rebounds.[17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDavid Thorpe, an athletic trainer who runs a training center for NBA players, cited Wade's post-up game as one of his strengths.[136] Thorpe said that Wade's best moves from the post were his turnaround jump shot,[136] double pivot,[136] and what Thorpe termed a \"freeze fake\",[137] a pump fake Wade used to get his opponent to jump, so that he could drive around him.[137] Wade's main weakness was three-point shooting; he averaged 29% for his career.[34]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## National team career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wade shooting a free-throw against China during the 2008 Olympics\nWade was a member of the 2004 Olympic team, which won a bronze medal in Athens.

Hardaway played in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the Golden State Warriors, Miami Heat, Dallas Mavericks, Denver Nuggets and Indiana Pacers. He was a five-time NBA All-Star and All-NBA Team selection. Hardaway won a gold medal with the United States national basketball team at the 2000 Summer Olympics. He was known for his crossover dribble which was dubbed the \"UTEP two-step\" by television analysts.\n\n\nHe is the father of current NBA player Tim Hardaway Jr.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nHardaway was born in Chicago, Illinois, and he graduated from Carver Area High School in 1985.\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\nHardaway played college basketball for the UTEP Miners under head coach Don Haskins, a future member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\n\nHardaway was twice named MVP of El Paso's Sun Bowl Invitational Tournament, in 1987 and 1988. He played on teams that went to the NCAA Tournaments in 1988 and 1989. He won the Frances Pomeroy Naismith Award in 1989 as the best college player in the nation six feet (1.83 m) tall or under. While playing for the Miners, Hardaway developed his crossover dribble move that was called the \"UTEP two-step\".[2]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section of a biography of a living person **needs additional citations for verification**.

In his rookie season, Hardaway wore number *5* on his jersey, as Manute Bol wore Hardaway's *10*. After Bol left the Warriors, Hardaway acquired the number. Hardaway, Mitch Richmond, and Chris Mullin formed a trio known as Run TMC (the initials of the players' first names and a play on the name of the popular rap group Run-DMC). As part of the Warriors' attack, Hardaway was responsible for leading Run TMC's fast break, displaying his excellent passing and one-on-one skills to complement Richmond's slashing and Mullin's shooting.\n\n\nGolden State made the playoffs during the 1990–91 season, Hardaway's second season and his first season in the playoffs. In the first round, the 7th seeded Warriors defeated the 2nd seeded San Antonio Spurs led by All-Star David Robinson in 4 games to advance to face the 3rd seeded Los Angeles Lakers led by NBA legend Magic Johnson. The Warriors managed to steal a game on the road in game 2, but could not defeat the more experienced Lakers, falling in five games despite Hardaway averaging 26.8 points, 12.8 assists and 3.8 steals for the series.\n\n\nHardaway averaged a career-high 23.4 points a game in the 1991–92 season, as the Warriors fell in the first round of the playoffs to the Seattle SuperSonics. The following season Hardaway averaged a career-high 10.6 assists a game to get with his scoring average of 21.5, but the Warriors did not make the playoffs and would not return to postseason action for the remainder of Hardaway's tenure with the team.\n\n\nAs a Warrior, Hardaway made the NBA All-Star Game three straight years, and a knee injury kept him out of the entire 1993–94 season. He reached 5,000 points and 2,500 assists faster than any other NBA player except Oscar Robertson. Hardaway played for the Warriors until the middle of 1995–96 season when he was traded to the Miami Heat along with Chris Gatling in exchange for Kevin Willis and Bimbo Coles.\n\n\n\n### Miami Heat (1996–2001)[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the mid-season trade to Miami, Hardaway started 28 games to finish the season, averaging 17.2 points a game with 10 assists. Miami made the playoffs but were swept in the first round by the 72 win Chicago Bulls. The following season was a huge success for Miami and for Hardaway, as he finished 4th in voting for the NBA Most Valuable Player Award, was selected to the All-NBA First Team as Miami won a franchise record 61 wins.\n\n\nHardaway started in 81 games, averaging 20.3 points, 8.6 assists, while placing fourth in the league with 203 three-point baskets. He also played in the 1997 NBA All-Star Game, scoring 10 points in 14 minutes. In the playoffs, Hardaway averaged 26 points a game as the Heat defeated the Orlando Magic in the first round in 5 games, and then defeated the New York Knicks in 7 games in the semifinals, in which Hardaway scored 38 points in the 7th game. Miami would once again fall to the defending champion Chicago Bulls in the Eastern Conference Finals in 5 games.\n\n\nIn the 1997–98 season, Hardaway averaged 18.9 points and 8.3 assist per game, and was selected to play in the 1998 NBA All-Star Game. The Heat won 55 games and won the Atlantic Division, but lost to the Knicks in 5 games in the first round of the playoffs. In the lockout shortened 1998–99 season, he averaged 17.4 points a game with 7.3 assists, and Miami won the Atlantic Division again but could once again not defeat the Knicks in the first round of the playoffs despite having home court advantage and the Knicks being the 8th seed in the playoffs.\n\n\nHardaway's production slipped in the 1999–2000 season, with Alonzo Mourning and Jamal Mashburn carrying more of the offensive load. Hardaway averaged 13.4 points with 7.4 assists a game, but shot a personal best .367 percent from beyond the three-point arc. After playing just 52 games, Hardaway was further limited in the playoffs, as Miami defeated the Detroit Pistons but once again fell to New York in 7 games.\n\n\nThat summer, Hardaway and Mourning won a gold medal playing for the U.S.A. men's basketball team at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. Before the 2000–01 season Mourning would be diagnosed with a rare kidney disease, and would be sidelined for much of the season. Hardaway upped his offensive production to 14.9 points a game with 6.3 assists a game as Miami won 50 games and captured the East's third best record, only to be swept in the first round by the Charlotte Hornets.\n\n\n\n### Dallas Mavericks (2001–2002)[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the 2000–01 season, and with his skills declining with age, Hardaway was traded to the Dallas Mavericks on August 22, 2001, for a second-round draft pick. He was at one time Miami's all-time leader in assists. With Dallas, Hardaway was mainly utilized off the bench, starting only two games out of 54 and averaging almost ten points a game. In the middle of the season, he was traded to the Denver Nuggets in exchange for point guard Nick Van Exel.\n\n\n\n### Denver Nuggets (2002)[edit]\n\n\nWith the Nuggets he started all 14 games he played with them before retiring and becoming a basketball analyst for ESPN.\n\n\nWhile playing for the Nuggets, Hardaway was suspended for two games and fined $10,000 by the league when he threw a television monitor onto the court.[3]\n\n\n\n### Indiana Pacers (2003)[edit]\n\n\nOn March 27, 2003, Hardaway signed a contract with the Indiana Pacers, and in his first game registered a season-high 14 points and seven assists against the Chicago Bulls. By the end of his career, Hardaway competed in five NBA All-Star Games.\n\n\n\n## Coaching career[edit]\n\n\n### Detroit Pistons (2014–2018)[edit]\n\n\nOn August 7, 2014, it was announced that Hardaway was named an assistant coach for the Detroit Pistons.[4]\n\n\n\n## Achievements[edit]\n\n\nHardaway was the 1989 WAC Player of the Year. He recorded 5,000 points and 2,500 assists, second fastest in NBA history after Oscar Robertson. Hardaway accomplished it in 262 games; Robertson took only 247.[5] He held the record for most assists in Miami Heat franchise history with 1,947,[5] until his total was surpassed by Dwyane Wade on January 16, 2010.\n\n\nHardaway shares the record for second most steals in an NBA playoffs game, with 8 in Game 2 of the 1991 Western Conference Semifinals against the Los Angeles Lakers and in Game 4 of the 1992 Western Conference First Round against the Seattle SuperSonics. In 1991–92, Hardaway became the 7th player in NBA history to average 20 points (23.4 ppg) and 10 assists (10.0 apg) in a season, a feat he accomplished again in 1992–93 (21.5 ppg, 10.6 apg).[5]\n\n\nHardaway holds the NBA record for the worst single-game shooting performance in NBA history, going 0-for-17 in a 106–102 win against the Minnesota Timberwolves on December 27, 1991.[6] Hardaway holds the Miami Heat's all-time record in 3-point field goals made, with 806. His number 10 was retired by the Miami Heat on October 28, 2009. On April 2, 2022, Hardaway was announced as one of thirteen members to be inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame for the Class of 2022 later this year.[7]\n\n\n\n## National team career[edit]\n\n\nHardaway was originally selected to play for \"Dream Team II\" in the 1994 FIBA World Championship but was replaced after suffering a torn knee ligament.[8]\n\n\nHe was also selected (as one of the last two players selected) for the 1998 FIBA World Championship team. The team was later replaced with CBA and college players due to the NBA lockout.[9]\n\n\nIn 2000, he played in the Sydney Olympics, scoring 5.5 points/Game and shooting .385 (15–39) from the field.[10]\n\n\nHardaway was a player/head coach of the Florida Pit Bulls of the ABA in 2006.[11][12]\n\n\nIn September 2009, he played for the NBA Generations team in the 2009 NBA Asia Challenge, a series of exhibitions against Korean Basketball League and Philippine Basketball Association players.[13]\n\n\n\n## Homophobia controversy[edit]\n\n\nDuring a February 14, 2007, interview on Miami's *The Dan Le Batard Show*, in response to the coming out of former NBA player John Amaechi, Hardaway remarked that he would try to distance himself from a player he knew was homosexual. When asked by the radio show host whether he realized that his remarks were homophobic, Hardaway responded by saying: \"Well, you know I hate gay people, so I let it be known. I don't like gay people and I don't like to be around gay people. I am homophobic. I don't like it. It shouldn't be in the world or in the United States.\" He also said that if he found out he had one or more gay teammates, he would try to get them fired.[14][15]\n\n\nLater in the day, Hardaway apologized for the remarks during a telephone interview with Fox affiliate WSVN in Miami. \"I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said I hate gay people or anything like that.\"[16] He further apologized on February 15 in a statement released by his agent.[17]\n\n\nOn the same day, the NBA responded to Hardaway's comments by removing him from its All-Star Weekend activities later that week.[17] His employer, Trinity Sports, owner of the Anderson-based CBA Indiana Alley Cats, dismissed him from his position as Chief Basketball Operations Advisor,[18] and the CBA issued a statement distancing itself from Hardaway's remarks.[19]\n\n\nIn a September 2007 interview, Hardaway spoke about his February comments, saying he \"had no idea how much I hurt people. A lot of people.\" He described the controversy as \"the biggest bump [in the road] in my life\", and added, \"I'm going to do whatever I can to correct it. That's all I can do.\"[20]\n\n\nIn an interview on February 11, 2010, on Hardcore Sports Radio on Sirius, Hardaway spoke about his recent work with The Trevor Project and The YES Institute, which he has done to educate himself on LGBT issues.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn April 2013, when Jason Collins came out as the first active openly gay male player in a major American professional team sport, Collins said that Hardaway called him in support of his homosexuality.[21] In July 2013, Hardaway was the symbolic first signer of a petition to put a proposed amendment to the Florida State Constitution overturning Florida Amendment 2 and allowing same-sex marriage in his home state of Florida on the ballot in 2014.[22]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nHardaway and his wife Yolanda reside in Michigan. They have a son, Tim Jr., and daughters, Nia and Nina.[5][23] Tim Jr. was drafted by the New York Knicks in 2013, and currently plays for the Dallas Mavericks.[24]\n\n\n\n## NBA career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n|   GP\n | Games played\n |   GS \n | Games started\n |  MPG \n | Minutes per game\n |\n|  FG% \n | Field goal percentage\n |  3P% \n | 3-point field goal percentage\n |  FT% \n | Free throw percentage\n |\n|  RPG \n | Rebounds per game\n |  APG \n | Assists per game\n |  SPG \n | Steals per game\n |\n|  BPG \n | Blocks per game\n |  PPG \n | Points per game\n | **Bold** | Career high\n |\n|  \\* \n | Led the league |  |\n\n\n### Regular season[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1989–90 | Golden State | 79 | 78 | 33.7 | .471 | .274 | .764 | 3.9 | 8.7 | 2.1 | **.2** | 14.7\n |\n| 1990–91 | Golden State | **82** | **82** | 39.2 | **.476** | **.385** | .803 | **4.0** | 9.7 | **2.6** | .1 | 22.9\n |\n| 1991–92 | Golden State | 81 | 81 | **41.1** | .461 | .338 | .766 | 3.8 | 10.0 | 2.0 | **.2** | **23.4** |\n| 1992–93 | Golden State | 66 | 66 | 39.5 | .447 | .330 | .744 | **4.0** | **10.6** | 1.8 | .**2** | 21.5\n |\n| 1994–95 | Golden State | 62 | 62 | 37.4 | .427 | .378 | .760 | 3.1 | 9.3 | 1.4 | **.2** | 20.1\n |\n| 1995–96 | Golden State | 52 | 18 | 28.6 | .421 | .366 | .769 | 2.5 | 6.9 | 1.4 | **.2** | 14.1\n |\n| 1995–96 | Miami | 28 | 28 | 37.4 | .425 | .361 | .821 | 3.5 | 10.0 | 1.0 | **.2** | 17.2\n |\n| 1996–97 | Miami | 81 | 81 | 38.7 | .415 | .344 | .799 | 3.4 | 8.6 | 1.9 | .1 | 20.3\n |\n| 1997–98 | Miami | 81 | 81 | 37.4 | .431 | .351 | .781 | 3.7 | 8.3 | 1.7 | **.2** | 18.9\n |\n| 1998–99 | Miami | 48 | 48 | 36.9 | .400 | .360 | .812 | 3.2 | 7.3 | 1.2 | .1 | 17.4\n |\n| 1999–00 | Miami | 52 | 52 | 32.2 | .386 | .367 | .827 | 2.9 | 7.4 | .9 | .1 | 13.4\n |\n| 2000–01 | Miami | 77 | 77 | 33.9 | .392 | .366 | .801 | 2.6 | 6.3 | 1.2 | .1 | 14.9\n |\n| 2001–02 | Dallas | 54 | 2 | 23.6 | .362 | .341 | **.833** | 1.8 | 3.7 | .4 | .1 | 9.6\n |\n| 2001–02 | Denver | 14 | 14 | 23.2 | .373 | .373 | .632 | 1.9 | 5.5 | 1.2 | .1 | 9.6\n |\n| 2002–03 | Indiana | 10 | 0 | 12.7 | .367 | .355 | .500 | 1.5 | 2.4 | .9 | .0 | 4.9\n |\n| Career\n | 867 | 770 | 35.3 | .431 | .355 | .782 | 3.3 | 8.2 | 1.6 | .1 | 17.7\n |\n| All-Star\n | 5 | 0 | 16.8 | .386 | .381 | .786 | 2.6 | 4.6 | 1.0 | 0.0 | 10.6\n |\n\n\n### Playoffs[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1991 | Golden State | 9 | 9 | 44.0 | **.486** | .354 | .789 | 3.7 | **11.2** | 3.1 | **.8** | 25.2\n |\n| 1992 | Golden State | 4 | 4 | 44.0 | .400 | .345 | .649 | 3.8 | 7.3 | **3.3** | .0 | 24.5\n |\n| 1996 | Miami | 3 | 3 | 36.7 | .465 | .364 | .714 | 1.7 | 5.7 | 1.0 | .0 | 17.7\n |\n| 1997 | Miami | **17** | **17** | 41.2 | .359 | .313 | **.795** | **4.1** | 7.0 | 1.6 | .1 | 18.7\n |\n| 1998 | Miami | 5 | 5 | **44.4** | .447 | **.436** | .784 | 3.4 | 6.6 | 1.2 | .0 | **26.0** |\n| 1999 | Miami | 5 | 5 | 36.4 | .268 | .200 | .625 | 2.8 | 6.4 | 1.0 | .2 | 9.0\n |\n| 2000 | Miami | 7 | 7 | 26.0 | .294 | .206 | .700 | 2.1 | 4.7 | .7 | .0 | 7.7\n |\n| 2001 | Miami | 2 | 2 | 18.0 | .222 | .333 | .000 | 1.0 | 4.5 | .0 | .0 | 2.5\n |\n| 2003 | Indiana | 4 | 0 | 11.8 | .333 | .300 | .000 | .5 | 2.3 | .3 | .0 | 3.3\n |\n| Career\n | 56 | 52 | 36.6 | .393 | .320 | .751 | 3.1 | 6.8 | 1.6 | .2 | 16.8\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Sports portal\n\n\n* List of National Basketball Association career assists leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career 3-point scoring leaders\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Tim Hardaway Stats\". *Basketball-Reference.com*.

The Heat struggled against the Bulls and although O'Neal put up reasonable numbers, he was not able to dominate the series. The Bulls swept the Heat, the first time in 50 years a defending NBA champion was swept in the opening round.[87] It was the first time in 13 years that O'Neal did not advance into the second round. In the 2006–07 season O'Neal reached 25,000 career points, becoming the 14th player in NBA history to accomplish that milestone. However, it was the first season in O'Neal's career that his scoring average dropped below 20 points per game.[9]\n\n\n\n#### Career lows and disagreements (2007–2008)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* List of National Basketball Association career scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career rebounding leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career blocks leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career turnovers leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career free throw scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career minutes played leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff rebounding leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff blocks leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff turnovers leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff free throw scoring leaders\n* List of individual National Basketball Association scoring leaders by season\n* List of National Basketball Association players with most points in a game\n* List of National Basketball Association single-game blocks leaders\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Celtics were 33–10 in games Perkins had missed during the year due to injury,[122] and they were 19–3 in games that O'Neal played over 20 minutes.[127] After requesting a cortisone shot, O'Neal returned April 3 after missing 27 games due to his Achilles; he played only five minutes due to a strained right calf.[122][128] It was the last regular season game he would play that year.[129] O'Neal missed the first round of the 2011 playoffs. He insisted on more cortisone shots and returned in the second round, but he was limited to 12 minutes in two games as the Heat eliminated the Celtics from the playoffs.[130][131]\n\n\nOn June 1, 2011, O'Neal announced his retirement via social media.[132][133] On a short video on Twitter, O'Neal tweeted, \"We did it. Nineteen years, baby. I want to thank you very much. That's why I'm telling you first. I'm about to retire. Love you. Talk to you soon.\" On June 3, 2011, O'Neal held a press conference at his home in Orlando to officially announce his retirement.[134]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 2003 | L.A.

The Heat led by Wade and a balanced effort by O'Neal, Antoine Walker and Jason Williams would go on to win all three of the next games at home, before closing out the series in Dallas to deliver the first NBA title for the franchise and O'Neal's fourth title. With Wade carrying the offensive load, O'Neal did not need to have a dominating series, and finished with an average of 13.7 points and 10.2 rebounds for the series.[81]\n\n\n\n#### Surgery and Wade's injury (2006–2007)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNBA 75th Anniversary Team\n |\n| --- |\n| * Kareem Abdul-Jabbar\n* Ray Allen\n* Giannis Antetokounmpo\n* Carmelo Anthony\n* Nate Archibald\n* Paul Arizin\n* Charles Barkley\n* Rick Barry\n* Elgin Baylor\n* Dave Bing\n* Larry Bird\n* Kobe Bryant\n* Wilt Chamberlain\n* Bob Cousy\n* Dave Cowens\n* Billy Cunningham\n* Stephen Curry\n* Anthony Davis\n* Dave DeBusschere\n* Clyde Drexler\n* Tim Duncan\n* Kevin Durant\n* Julius Erving\n* Patrick Ewing\n* Walt Frazier\n* Kevin Garnett\n* George Gervin\n* Hal Greer\n* James Harden\n* John Havlicek\n* Elvin Hayes\n* Allen Iverson\n* LeBron James\n* Magic Johnson\n* Sam Jones\n* Michael Jordan\n* Jason Kidd\n* Kawhi Leonard\n* Damian Lillard\n* Jerry Lucas\n* Karl Malone\n* Moses Malone\n* Pete Maravich\n* Bob McAdoo\n* Kevin McHale\n* George Mikan\n* Reggie Miller\n* Earl Monroe\n* Steve Nash\n* Dirk Nowitzki\n* Hakeem Olajuwon\n* Shaquille O'Neal\n* Robert Parish\n* Chris Paul\n* Gary Payton\n* Bob Pettit\n* Paul Pierce\n* Scottie Pippen\n* Willis Reed\n* Oscar Robertson\n* David Robinson\n* Dennis Rodman\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHowever, Miami showed interest, and eventually the two clubs agreed on a trade.[72] Winter said, \"[O'Neal] left because he couldn't get what he wanted—a huge pay raise. There was no way ownership could give him what he wanted. Shaq's demands held the franchise hostage, and the way he went about it didn't please the owner too much.\"[73]\n\n\n\n### Miami Heat (2004–2008)[edit]\n\n\n#### MVP runner-up (2004–2005)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the second game of the 2005–06 season, O'Neal injured his right ankle and subsequently missed the following 18 games. Upon O'Neal's return, Van Gundy resigned, citing family reasons, and Pat Riley assumed head coach responsibilities.[67] O'Neal later referred to Van Gundy as a \"frontrunner\" and a \"master of panic.\"[77] Many critics stated that Heat coach Riley correctly managed O'Neal during the rest of the season, limiting his minutes to a career low. Riley felt doing so would allow O'Neal to be healthier and fresher come playoff time. Although O'Neal averaged career lows (or near-lows) in points, rebounds, and blocks, he said in an interview \"Stats don't matter. I care about winning, not stats. If I score 0 points and we win I'm happy. If I score 50, 60 points, break the records, and we lose, I'm pissed off. 'Cause I knew I did something wrong. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the 2006 NBA Playoffs, the Heat first faced the younger Chicago Bulls, and O'Neal delivered a dominating 27 point, 16 rebound and 5 blocks performance in game 1 followed by a 22-point effort in game 2 to help Miami take a 2–0 lead in the series. Chicago would respond with two dominating performances at home to tie the series, but Miami would respond right back with a victory at home in game 5. Miami returned to Chicago and closed out the series in the 6th game, highlighted by another dominating performance by O'Neal who finished with 30 points and 20 rebounds. Miami advanced to face New Jersey, who won a surprising game 1 victory before the Heat won four straight to assure a rematch with Detroit. The Pistons had no answer for Wade throughout the series, while O'Neal delivered 21 points and 12 rebounds in game 3 followed by 27 points and 12 boards in game 4 to help Miami take a 3–1 series lead. The Pistons would win game 5 in Detroit, and Wade would once again get injured, but the Heat \n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n51. **^** Stein, Marc (December 19, 1996). \"O'Neal wanted to pack more offensive punch\". *Los Angeles Daily News*.

Afterwards, O'Neal and others criticized Heat head coach Stan Van Gundy for not calling enough plays for O'Neal.[75] \nIn August 2005, O'Neal signed a 5-year-extension with the Heat for $100 million. Supporters applauded O'Neal's willingness to take what amounted to a pay cut and the Heat's decision to secure O'Neal's services for the long term. They contended that O'Neal was worth more than $20 million per year, particularly given that lesser players earned almost the same amount.[76]\n\n\n\n#### Fourth championship (2005–2006)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn July 14, 2004, O'Neal was traded to the Miami Heat for Caron Butler, Lamar Odom, Brian Grant, and a future first-round draft choice (the Lakers used the draft choice to select Jordan Farmar in the 2006 draft). O'Neal reverted from (his Lakers jersey) number 34 to number 32, which he had worn while playing for the Magic. Upon signing with the Heat, O'Neal promised the fans that he would bring a championship to Miami. He claimed one of the main reasons for wanting to be traded to Miami was because of their up-and-coming star Dwyane Wade, to whom he gave the nickname \"Flash\". With O'Neal on board, the new-look Heat surpassed expectations, claiming the best record in the Eastern Conference in 2004–05 with 59 wins. He played in 73 games, his most since 2001 season, averaged 22.9 points a game along with 10.4 rebounds and 2.3 blocks. O'Neal made his 12th consecutive All-Star Team, made the All-NBA 1st Team, and won the Eastern Conference Player of the Month award for his performance in March. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. **^** Heisler, Mark. \"Shaquille O'Neal traded to Cleveland Cavaliers for 3 players, cash\". *Los Angeles Times*.

Jackson had previously said, \"The only person I've ever [coached] that hasn't been a worker... is probably Shaq.\"[84] The Heat struggled during O'Neal's absence,[85] but with his return won seven of their next eight games. Bad luck still haunted the squad, however, as Wade dislocated his left shoulder, leaving O'Neal as the focus of the team.[85] Critics doubted that O'Neal, now in his mid-30s, could carry the team into the playoffs.[86] The Heat went on a winning streak that kept them in the race for a playoff spot, which they finally secured against the Cleveland Cavaliers on April 5.[85]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Ernie Johnson Jr.\n* Bob Lorenz\n* Casey Stern\n* Matt Winer\n |\n| Studio analysts | * Charles Barkley\n* Jamal Crawford\n* Draymond Green\n* Magic Johnson\n* Lisa Leslie\n* Kevin McHale\n* Shaquille O'Neal\n* Candace Parker\n* Gary Payton\n* Kenny Smith\n* Reggie Theus\n* Isiah Thomas\n* Dwyane Wade\n |\n| Contributors | * Jim Huber\n |\n\n |\n| NBA drafts | * 1990\n* 1991\n* 1992\n* 1993\n* 1994\n* 1995\n* 1996\n* 1997\n* 1998\n* 1999\n* 2000\n* 2001\n* 2002\n |\n| All-Star Game | * 2003\n* 2004\n* 2005\n* 2006\n* 2007\n* 2008\n* 2009\n* 2010\n* 2011\n* 2012\n* 2013\n* 2014\n* 2015\n* 2016\n* 2017\n* 2018\n* 2019\n* 2020\n* 2021\n* 2022\n* 2023\n* 2024\n* 2025\n |\n| NBA Awards | * 2017\n* 2018\n* 2019\n |\n| Lore | * Christmas Day\n* NBA outdoor games\n* Disputed foul against Scottie Pippen\n |\n |\n\nPortals:* ![icon](image) Basketball\n* ![](image) Biography\n* ![](image) Sports\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nLegend\n|   GP\n | Games played\n |   GS \n | Games started\n |  MPG \n | Minutes per game\n |\n|  FG% \n | Field goal percentage\n |  3P% \n | 3-point field goal percentage\n |  FT% \n | Free throw percentage\n |\n|  RPG \n | Rebounds per game\n |  APG \n | Assists per game\n |  SPG \n | Steals per game\n |\n|  BPG \n | Blocks per game\n |  PPG \n | Points per game\n | **Bold** | Career high\n |\n|  † \n | Won an NBA championship |  \\* \n | Led the league |  |\n\n\n### Regular season[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nO'Neal experienced a rough start for the 2007–08 season, averaging career lows in points, rebounds, and blocks. His role in the offense diminished, as he attempted only 10 field goals per game, versus his career average of 17. In addition, O'Neal was plagued by fouls, and during one stretch fouled out of five consecutive games. O'Neal's streak of 14 straight All-Star appearances ended that season.[9] O'Neal again missed games due to injuries, and the Heat had a 15–game losing streak.[88] According to O'Neal, Riley thought he was faking the injury.[89] During a practice in February 2008, O'Neal got into an altercation with Riley over the coach ordering a tardy Jason Williams to leave practice. The two argued face-to-face, with O'Neal poking Riley in the chest and Riley slapping his finger away. Riley soon after decided to trade O'Neal.[90] O'Neal said his relationship with Wade was not \"all that good\" by the time he left Miami, but he did not express disappointment at Wade for failing to stand up for him.[91]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNBA annual scoring leaders\n |\n| --- |\n| * 1947: Fulks\n* 1948: Zaslofsky\n* 1949: Mikan\n* 1950: Mikan\n* 1951: Mikan\n* 1952: Arizin\n* 1953: Johnston\n* 1954: Johnston\n* 1955: Johnston\n* 1956: Pettit\n* 1957: Arizin\n* 1958: Yardley\n* 1959: Pettit\n* 1960: Chamberlain\n* 1961: Chamberlain\n* 1962: Chamberlain\n* 1963: Chamberlain\n* 1964: Chamberlain\n* 1965: Chamberlain\n* 1966: Chamberlain\n* 1967: Barry\n* 1968: Bing\n* 1969: Hayes\n* 1970: West\n* 1971: Alcindor\n* 1972: Abdul-Jabbar\n* 1973: Archibald\n* 1974: McAdoo\n* 1975: McAdoo\n* 1976: McAdoo\n* 1977: Maravich\n* 1978: Gervin\n* 1979: Gervin\n* 1980: Gervin\n* 1981: Dantley\n* 1982: Gervin\n* 1983: English\n* 1984: Dantley\n* 1985: King\n* 1986: Wilkins\n* 1987: Jordan\n* 1988: Jordan\n* 1989: Jordan\n* 1990: Jordan\n* 1991: Jordan\n* 1992: Jordan\n* 1993: Jordan\n* 1994: Robinson\n* 1995: O'Neal\n* 1996: Jordan\n* 1997: Jordan\n* 1998: Jordan\n* 1999: Iverson\n* 2000: O'Neal\n* 2001: Iverson\n* 2002: Iverson\n* 2003: McGrady\n* 2004: McGrady\n* 2005: Iverson\n* 2006: Bryant\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)O'Neal with Miami in 2007\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNBA Finals Bill Russell Most Valuable Player Award\n |\n| --- |\n| * 1969: West\n* 1970: Reed\n* 1971: Alcindor\n* 1972: Chamberlain\n* 1973: Reed\n* 1974: Havlicek\n* 1975: Barry\n* 1976: White\n* 1977: Walton\n* 1978: Unseld\n* 1979: D.

He quickly became one of the best centers in the league, winning Rookie of the Year in 1992–93 and leading his team to the 1995 NBA Finals. After four years with the Magic, O'Neal signed as a free agent with the Los Angeles Lakers. They won three consecutive championships in 2000, 2001, and 2002. Amid a feud between O'Neal and his teammate Kobe Bryant, O'Neal was traded to the Miami Heat in 2004, and his fourth NBA championship followed in 2006. Midway through the 2007–2008 season he was traded to the Phoenix Suns. After a season-and-a-half with the Suns, O'Neal was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2009–10 season.[6] O'Neal played for the Boston Celtics in the 2010–11 season before retiring.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Shaquille O'Neal | Stats\". *NBA.com*.

No one is asking me to play with [his former Heat teammates] Chris Quinn or Ricky Davis. I'm actually on a team again.\" Riley felt O'Neal was wrong for maligning his former teammates. O'Neal responded with an expletive toward Riley, whom he often referred to as the \"great Pat Riley\" while playing for the Heat.[96] O'Neal credited the Suns training staff with prolonging his career.[97] They connected his arthritic toe, which would not bend, to the alteration of his jump that consequently was straining his leg.

After O'Neal blocked a layup by Barkley, O'Neal shoved Barkley, who then threw the ball at O'Neal.[54] On March 6, 2000, O'Neal's 28th birthday, he scored a career-high 61 points to go along with 23 rebounds and 3 assists in a 123–103 win over the LA Clippers.[55] O'Neal's 61-point game is the most recent game in NBA history that a player scored 60 or more points without hitting a 3-pointer.[56]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Play-by-play | * Marv Albert\n* Brian Anderson\n* Gary Bender\n* Tim Brando\n* Mike Breen\n* Kevin Calabro\n* Skip Caray\n* Spero Dedes\n* Matt Devlin\n* Jim Durham\n* Ian Eagle\n* Bob Fitzgerald\n* Kevin Harlan\n* Todd Harris\n* Gus Johnson\n* Verne Lundquist\n* Joel Meyers\n* Bob Neal\n* Mel Proctor\n* Dick Stockton\n* Ron Thulin\n* Pete Van Wieren\n |\n| Colorcommentators | * Danny Ainge\n* Greg Anthony\n* Brent Barry\n* Rick Barry\n* Hubie Brown\n* P.

Following his college basketball career at Georgetown University, his tenacity on defense twice earned him the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award and twice placed him on the NBA All-Defensive Team. Mourning made a comeback after undergoing a kidney transplant and later won the 2006 NBA championship with the Heat. Mourning also played for the Charlotte Hornets and New Jersey Nets. On March 30, 2009, Mourning became the first Miami Heat player to have his number retired.[3] In 2010, Mourning was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame. In August 2014, Mourning was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, and in August 2019 he was inducted into the FIBA Hall of Fame.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nDuring his time at Indian River High School in Chesapeake, Virginia, he led the team to 51 straight victories and a state title his junior year (1987). As a senior, he averaged 25 points, 15 rebounds and 12 blocked shots per game. He was named Player of the Year by USA Today, Parade, Gatorade, and Naismith. He was the #1 recruit of the 1988 class, over Christian Laettner, Shawn Kemp, Billy Owens, Kenny Williams, Stanley Roberts, Rick Fox, and Malik Sealy, among others.\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\nMourning played college basketball for John Thompson at Georgetown University. He made an immediate impact as a freshman, starting all 34 games for the Hoyas, averaging 13.1 points and 7.3 rebounds per game. But his most notable accomplishment was leading the nation in total blocked shots (169) and blocks per game (5.0); both figures led the nation and set NCAA records for a freshman at that time.\n\n\nMourning's scoring and rebounding improved over the next two seasons, but his shot-blocking declined significantly, as his taller teammate Dikembe Mutombo established himself as starting center for Georgetown, forcing Mourning to play at power forward. After Mutombo entered the NBA draft in 1991, Mourning re-took his place as starting center, and responded with a spectacular senior season in 1991–92. He averaged 21.3 points, 10.7 rebounds, and 5.0 blocks per game that year, and collected numerous awards, including Consensus First-Team All-American and Big East Conference Player of the Year. He was also named Big East Defensive Player of the Year, which he had won twice previously (as a freshman in 1988–89, and again as a sophomore in 1989–90, sharing the award with Mutombo that season; Mutombo won the award alone in 1990–91).\n\n\nMourning finished his college career with 2,001 points and 1,032 rebounds, reaching the exclusive 2,000-point and 1,000-rebound milestone. More impressively, he finished with 453 blocked shots in his college career, ranking first all-time in NCAA history at that time. Interestingly, Mourning was never listed as the all-time leader in Georgetown history, as the school credits Patrick Ewing with 493 blocks during his college career,[4] but blocked shots were not an official NCAA statistic at that time.\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Charlotte Hornets (1992–1995)[edit]\n\n\nMourning was selected second overall in the 1992 NBA draft by the Charlotte Hornets, behind Shaquille O'Neal and before Christian Laettner.[5] Mourning was named to the league's all-rookie team in 1993 after averaging 21.0 points, 10.3 rebounds, and 3.47 blocks. He finished second to Shaquille O'Neal in rookie of the year voting.[6] He posted the highest scoring average of any rookie in Hornets history. Mourning and O'Neal were the first NBA rookies since David Robinson in the 1989–90 season to average 20 or more points and 10-plus rebounds in their first seasons. Mourning shattered Charlotte's blocked-shots records, becoming the Hornets' all-time career leader in the 49th game of the season. The greatest moment of Mourning's rookie season came on May 5, 1993, in Game 4 of a first-round playoff series against the Boston Celtics. His 20-footer with .4 seconds left gave the Hornets a 104–103 victory in the game and a 3–1 victory in the series. The Hornets lost in the second round to the New York Knicks in five games, with Mourning averaging 23.8 points, 9.9 rebounds and 3.4 blocks in nine playoff games. The following year, Mourning played in just 60 games, posting almost similar averages of 21.5 points, 10.2 rebounds and 3.1 blocks per game, but the Hornets missed the playoffs.\n\n\nIn the 1994–95 season, Mourning and teammate Larry Johnson led the Hornets to a 50-win season and reached the playoffs. Mourning ranked first on the team in scoring (21.3 per game), rebounding (9.9 per game), blocked shots (2.92 per game), and field goal percentage (.519), and played in the 1995 NBA All-Star Game where he scored 10 points and grabbed 8 rebounds. The Hornets lost in four games to the Chicago Bulls in the first round of the playoffs, despite Mourning averaging 22 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 3.3 blocks during the series.\n\n\n\n### Miami Heat (1995–2003)[edit]\n\n\nOn November 3, 1995, after Mourning rejected Charlotte's contract extension offer worth an average of $11.2 million for seven years and knowing they would not be able to re-sign him, the Hornets traded him, along with reserves Pete Myers and LeRon Ellis in exchange for Glen Rice, Matt Geiger, Khalid Reeves and a first-round pick in the 1996 NBA draft.[7]\n\n\nMourning would immediately serve as the centerpiece of the Pat Riley-coached Heat, and in his first season in Miami he averaged 23.2 points, 10.4 rebounds and 2.7 blocks per game as Miami made the playoffs before being swept in the first round by the 72-win Bulls. Mourning played in the 1996 NBA All-Star Game and was joined by All-Star point guard Tim Hardaway who arrived through a mid-season trade.\n\n\nIn July 1996, Mourning signed a seven-year, $105 million contract with the Heat.[8] In the 1996–97 season, the Heat would go on to win a then franchise-record 61 games, finishing second in the Eastern Conference behind the defending champions Bulls, while Mourning averaged 19.8 points, 9.9 rebounds and 2.9 blocks per game. In the playoffs, Miami defeated the Orlando Magic in five games, and advanced to the conference semifinals against the Knicks, where the rivalry between the Heat and the New York Knicks intensified. The Knicks took a 3–1 series lead, but following a brawl between Charlie Ward and P. J. Brown late in Game 5, multiple suspensions were handed down. Mourning scored 28 points in Game 6, followed by a 22-point, 12-rebound performance in Game 7 to help Miami advance to the Eastern Conference Finals, a franchise first, to face Chicago. The Bulls took a 3–0 series lead, and Mourning guaranteed a victory in Game 4 as the Heat won 87–80.[9] However, with a 100–87 loss in Game 5, the Heat were eliminated by the Bulls.\n\n\nIn the 1997–98 season, Mourning played 58 games and averaged 19.2 points, 9.6 rebounds and 2.2 blocks per game as the Heat won 55 games. However, Miami lost in the first round to the Knicks, with Mourning missing the deciding Game 5 due to a suspension caused by a fight between Mourning and former teammate Larry Johnson in Game 4.[10] The brawl also involved Knicks head coach Jeff Van Gundy, who was seen dangling on Mourning's leg in an attempt to break up the fight.[11] The following season, the Heat won 31 games in a lockout-shortened 50-game schedule, and Mourning won his first of two consecutive Defensive Player of the Year awards after leading the league in blocks with 3.9 per game. Despite finishing with the best record in the Eastern Conference, the Heat once again fell short to the Knicks in the first round, with Allan Houston securing the series victory with a last-second jumper in Game 5.[12][13] Mourning again led the NBA in blocks in the 1999–2000 season, this time with a 3.7 average, and won Defensive Player of the Year. Miami finished the regular season with 52 wins and faced the Knicks in the second round. But for a third straight season, the Heat lost to the Knicks in a winner-take-all game, this time in Game 7.[14]\n\n\nShortly after playing for the gold medal-winning U.S. national team in the 2000 Summer Olympics, Mourning was diagnosed with a serious kidney disease.[15] Initially deemed out for the remainder of the season, Mourning returned for the final 13 games, helping the Heat win 50 games despite playing limited minutes. However, Miami was swept 3–0 in the first round by the Hornets.[16] In the 2001–02 season, Mourning played 75 games and averaged 15.7 points, 8.4 rebounds and 2.5 blocks per game, earning his final All-Star nod. Despite that, the Heat missed the playoffs with a 36–46 record. Mourning missed the entire 2002–03 season as he continued to deal with a serious kidney disorder, and without their star center, the Heat won only 25 games and missed the playoffs again.[17]\n\n\n\n### New Jersey Nets (2003–2004)[edit]\n\n\nMourning signed a four-year deal with the New Jersey Nets in July 2003 as a free agent.[18][19] On November 24, 2003, after appearing in 12 games, Mourning retired from the NBA due to complications from his kidney disease.[20][21] On December 19, he underwent a successful kidney transplant.[22] In 2004, he started practicing with the Nets again, and made the team's regular season roster during the 2004–05 season. He did not play a significant role with the Nets, however, and openly complained to the media that he wanted out of New Jersey, especially after the team traded away Kenyon Martin.[23][24] After playing in just 30 total games for New Jersey, Mourning, Eric Williams and Aaron Williams were traded to the Toronto Raptors for Vince Carter on December 17, 2004.[25][26] Mourning never reported to the Raptors, and was bought out of his contract at a remaining $9 million on February 11, 2005. Raptors team officials later said that he did not meet the medical conditions to play for the team.[27][28][29] Mourning then finished the season with the Heat being paid a second salary, the veteran's minimum.[30]\n\n\n\n### Return to the Heat (2005–2008)[edit]\n\n\nMourning re-signed with the Heat on March 1, 2005.[31] His role was reduced as a backup because of superstar Shaquille O'Neal, although he was called upon as a starter due to O'Neal missing stretches due to injury. O'Neal and Mourning even played together on the court at times, with Mourning playing power forward. Because of physical limitations, his minutes were reduced, but was still a steady contributor. Mourning's tenacious defense, steady offense, and all around hustle helped the Heat gain and maintain the first seed in Eastern Conference during the 2004–05 season. Mourning finished the regular season ranking third in blocked shots at 2.66 per game, despite only playing 20 minutes per contest. Miami swept the Nets in the first round of the playoffs, with Mourning recording 21 points and nine rebounds in just 16 minutes in Game 2. In the second round against the Washington Wizards, Mourning stepped in for the injured O'Neal and scored 14 points with 13 rebounds and blocked four shots in Game 3 as Miami completed another four-game sweep. Miami fell in seven games to the defending champions, the Detroit Pistons, in the Eastern Conference Finals, with Mourning leading the team in blocks with three per game for the series.\n\n\nOn June 17, 2005, the Heat picked up the team option on Mourning,[32] as the Heat once again overhauled their roster, acquiring other veterans seeking a title such as Antoine Walker and Gary Payton.[33][34] Mourning continued to serve as the Heat's backup center, and early on stepped in to serve as the team's starting center after O'Neal suffered an injury. Mourning started in 20 games out of a total of 65 games played, averaging 7.8 points and 5.5 rebounds, while finishing third in the league with 2.7 blocks per game despite playing as a reserve. In the playoffs, Mourning continued to shine in his role as a defensive player off the bench, as Miami advanced past the Bulls and the Nets before defeating the Pistons in six games to advance to the 2006 NBA Finals, the first NBA Finals in franchise history and the first for Mourning. After a 2–0 deficit, Miami won all three of its home games led by the spectacular play of Dwyane Wade, and in Game 6 in Dallas, Mourning came off the bench to score eight points with six rebounds and a team-high five blocks to help Miami win its first NBA championship in franchise history.\n\n\nAfter winning the championship, Mourning announced that he would return to the Heat in the 2006–07 season to defend their title, despite receiving offers of more money from other teams, including the San Antonio Spurs.[35] In 2007, Mourning announced he would return for one more year with the Heat and his 15th season. \"It will definitely be my last year\", Mourning said.[36] After starting the season on a solid note averaging 6 points, 3.8 rebounds and 1.75 blocks in just over 16 minutes played per 24 games,[37] Mourning tore his patellar tendon in his right knee[38] on December 19, 2007, during the first quarter of the 117–111 overtime loss to the Atlanta Hawks.[39][40]\n\n\nDuring the 2007–08 season, he became the Heat's all-time leader in points scored (which has since been surpassed by Dwyane Wade).[41]\n\n\n\n## Retirement[edit]\n\n\nMourning announced his retirement from the NBA on January 22, 2009. In his press conference he said, \"At 38 I feel like I've physically done all I can for this game.\"[42][43] One month later, the Heat announced that they would retire Mourning's number 33 jersey, making him the first Heat player to be so honored.[3] The jersey retirement ceremony occurred on March 30, 2009, when the Heat hosted the Orlando Magic. During the extended halftime ceremony, Mourning was introduced by Florida Governor Charlie Crist; former Georgetown University basketball coach John Thompson; Basketball Hall of Famer Patrick Ewing; Heat players Dwyane Wade and Udonis Haslem; and Heat head coach Pat Riley.[44][45]\n\n\nIn May 2009, he was named to the Hampton Roads Sports Hall of Fame, which honors athletes, coaches, and administrators who contributed to sports in southeastern Virginia. In the following April, he was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame in recognition of his outstanding high school, collegiate, and professional career as well as his commitment to volunteer service in the communities in which he has lived and worked throughout his life.[46]\n\n\nMourning announced his return to the Heat in late June 2009; he holds the position of vice president of player programs and development, which covers community outreach and mentoring young players.[47]\n\n\nMourning played in a basketball game for Barack Obama's 50th birthday at the basketball court at the White House in 2011. In addition to Mourning, the game featured Shane Battier, LeBron James, Magic Johnson, Maya Moore, Joakim Noah, Chris Paul and Derrick Rose and Obama's friends from high school. Kobe Bryant and Bill Russell were spectators.[48]\n\n\nOn April 7, 2014, it was announced that Mourning would be inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame on August 8.[49][50][51]\n\n\nOn March 26, 2019, Mourning was named to the FIBA Hall of Fame,[52] and was inducted on August 30.[53][54]\n\n\nIn 2021, to commemorate the NBA's 75th anniversary *The Athletic* ranked their top 75 players of all-time, and named Mourning as the 69th greatest player in NBA history.[55]\n\n\n\n## Awards and achievements[edit]\n\n\n* 3-time NBA champion: 2006 (as a player), 2012, 2013 (as vice president of player programs)\n* 7-time NBA All-Star: 1994–1997, 2000–2002\n* All-NBA First Team: 1999\n* All-NBA Second Team: 2000\n* 2-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year: 1999, 2000\n* 2-time NBA All-Defensive First Team: 1999, 2000\n* NBA All-Rookie First Team: 1993\n* J.

Funds are allocated toward research for a cure, education for doctors and the general public, testing for early detection and a fund for those not able to afford medication.\n\n\nIn 2007, Mourning along with Andre Agassi, Muhammad Ali, Lance Armstrong, Warrick Dunn, Mia Hamm, Jeff Gordon, Tony Hawk, Andrea Jaeger, Jackie Joyner-Kersee, Mario Lemieux, and Cal Ripken Jr. founded Athletes for Hope, a charitable organization, which helps professional athletes get involved in charitable causes and inspires millions of non-athletes to volunteer and support the community.[58]\n\n\nIn 2003, he also founded the Overtown Youth Center for underprivileged kids, located in Miami, Florida. The program aims to inspire, empower, and enrich these children while teaching them to become positive contributing citizens.\n\n\nIn 2009, the Miami-Dade school board named a new high school in North Miami, Florida, in his honor, Alonzo and Tracy Mourning Senior High Biscayne Bay Campus.\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nMourning and his ex-wife Tracy have three children.[59] Like his father, his oldest son, Trey Mourning played for the Georgetown Hoyas basketball team, wearing his father's signature number 33 jersey. They resided in Pinecrest, Florida, where Mourning purchased a two-story, 9,786-square-foot residence for $4.5 million in 2012.[60] On June 26, 2019, Trey was included on the Miami Heat roster for the 2019 NBA Summer League,[61] and was later selected second overall by the Sioux Falls Skyforce of the NBA G League in the 2019 NBA G League draft.[62]\n\n\nIn July 2011, Mourning was sued by Miami-based lawyer Spencer Aronfeld on behalf of Alberto Candoleria for crashing his car into another car and then leaving the scene of the accident. The Florida Highway Patrol later charged Mourning with leaving the scene of a car accident. The accident allegedly occurred after he left Chris Bosh's wedding in Miami Beach after 3:00 a.m. Candoleria had just been in an accident when Mourning struck his car.[63][64][65]\n\n\nIn 2015, Mourning was one of eight Virginians honored in the Library of Virginia's \"Strong Men & Women in Virginia History\" for his charitable work and for his contributions to the sport of basketball.[66]\n\n\n\n### Kidney transplant[edit]\n\n\nOn November 25, 2003, Mourning's cousin and a retired U. S. Marine, Jason Cooper, was visiting Mourning's gravely ill grandmother in the hospital. Mourning's father was present and informed Cooper that Mourning was retiring that day from the NBA because of a life-threatening kidney disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, the same problem that Sean Elliott had in 1999. Cooper asked if there was anything he could do, and began to contemplate donating one of his kidneys to his estranged cousin, whom he had not seen in 25 years and whom he only knew through basketball. Cooper was tested for compatibility, along with many other family members and friends (including fellow NBA center and good friend Patrick Ewing); during his grandmother's funeral, Mourning received the news that Jason Cooper was a match.[67][68]\n\n\nMourning received Cooper's left kidney on December 19, 2003.[66][68]\n\n\n\n## NBA career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n|   GP\n | Games played\n |   GS \n | Games started\n |  MPG \n | Minutes per game\n |\n|  FG% \n | Field goal percentage\n |  3P% \n | 3-point field goal percentage\n |  FT% \n | Free throw percentage\n |\n|  RPG \n | Rebounds per game\n |  APG \n | Assists per game\n |  SPG \n | Steals per game\n |\n|  BPG \n | Blocks per game\n |  PPG \n | Points per game\n | **Bold** | Career high\n |\n|  † \n | Won an NBA championship |  \\* \n | Led the league |  |\n\n\n### Regular season[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1992–93 | Charlotte | 78 | **78** | 33.9 | .511 | .000 | .781 | 10.3 | 1.0 | .3 | 3.5 | 21.0\n |\n| 1993–94 | Charlotte | 60 | 59 | 33.6 | .505 | .000 | .762 | 10.2 | 1.4 | .5 | 3.1 | 21.5\n |\n| 1994–95 | Charlotte | 77 | 77 | **38.2** | .519 | .324 | .761 | 9.9 | 1.4 | .6 | 2.9 | 21.3\n |\n| 1995–96 | Miami | 70 | 70 | **38.2** | .523 | .300 | .685 | 10.4 | **2.3** | **1.0** | 2.7 | **23.2** |\n| 1996–97 | Miami | 66 | 65 | 35.2 | .534 | .111 | .642 | 9.9 | 1.6 | .8 | 2.9 | 19.8\n |\n| 1997–98 | Miami | 58 | 56 | 33.4 | .551 | .000 | .665 | 9.6 | .9 | .7 | 2.2 | 19.2\n |\n| 1998–99 | Miami | 46 | 46 | 38.1 | .511 | .000 | .652 | **11.0** | 1.6 | .7 | **3.9\\*** | 20.1\n |\n| 1999–00 | Miami | **79** | **78** | 34.8 | .551 | .000 | .711 | 9.5 | 1.6 | .5 | 3.7\\* | 21.7\n |\n| 2000–01 | Miami | 13 | 3 | 23.5 | .518 | .000 | .564 | 7.8 | .9 | .3 | 2.4 | 13.6\n |\n| 2001–02 | Miami | 75 | 74 | 32.7 | .516 | **.333** | .657 | 8.4 | 1.2 | .4 | 2.5 | 15.7\n |\n| 2003–04 | New Jersey | 12 | 0 | 17.9 | .465 | .000 | **.882** | 2.3 | .7 | .2 | .5 | 8.0\n |\n| 2004–05 | New Jersey | 18 | 14 | 25.4 | .453 | .000 | .593 | 7.1 | .8 | .3 | 2.3 | 10.4\n |\n| 2004–05 | Miami | 19 | 3 | 12.9 | .516 | .000 | .564 | 3.7 | .2 | .2 | 1.7 | 5.0\n |\n| 2005–06†\n | Miami | 65 | 20 | 20.0 | **.597** | .000 | .594 | 5.5 | .2 | .2 | 2.7 | 7.8\n |\n| 2006–07 | Miami | 77 | 43 | 20.4 | .560 | .000 | .601 | 4.5 | .2 | .2 | 2.3 | 8.6\n |\n| 2007–08 | Miami | 25 | 0 | 15.6 | .547 | .000 | .592 | 3.7 | .3 | .2 | 1.7 | 6.0\n |\n| Career\n | 838 | 686 | 31.0 | .527 | .247 | .692 | 8.5 | 1.1 | .5 | 2.8 | 17.1\n |\n| All-Star\n | 4 | 1 | 18.8 | .545 | .000 | .667 | 4.8 | 1.0 | .8 | 2.0 | 10.0\n |\n\n\n### Playoffs[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1993 | Charlotte | 9 | 9 | 40.8 | .480 | .000 | .774 | 9.9 | 1.4 | .7 | **3.4** | **23.8** |\n| 1995 | Charlotte | 4 | 4 | **43.5** | .421 | **.500** | **.837** | **13.3** | **2.8** | .8 | 3.3\\* | 22.0\n |\n| 1996 | Miami | 3 | 3 | 30.7 | .486 | .000 | .714 | 6.0 | 1.3 | .7 | 1.0 | 18.0\n |\n| 1997 | Miami | 17 | **17** | 37.1 | .491 | .375 | .555 | 10.2 | 1.1 | .6 | 2.7\\* | 17.8\n |\n| 1998 | Miami | 4 | 4 | 34.5 | .518 | .000 | .655 | 8.5 | 1.3 | .8 | 2.5 | 19.3\n |\n| 1999 | Miami | 5 | 5 | 38.8 | .521 | .000 | .653 | 8.2 | .8 | **1.6** | 2.8 | 21.6\n |\n| 2000 | Miami | 10 | 10 | 37.6 | .484 | .000 | .667 | 10.0 | 1.4 | .2 | 3.3\\* | 21.6\n |\n| 2001 | Miami | 3 | 3 | 30.3 | .480 | .000 | .579 | 5.3 | 1.0 | .0 | 1.7 | 11.7\n |\n| 2005 | Miami | 15 | 2 | 16.9 | .705 | .000 | .558 | 4.8 | .3 | .3 | 2.2 | 6.1\n |\n| 2006†\n | Miami | **21** | 0 | 10.8 | .703 | .000 | .667 | 2.9 | .1 | .2 | 1.1 | 3.8\n |\n| 2007 | Miami | 4 | 0 | 13.8 | **.909** | .000 | .385 | 2.0 | .3 | .0 | .8 | 6.3\n |\n| Career\n | 95 | 57 | 27.3 | .512 | .368 | .649 | 7.0 | .9 | .5 | 2.3 | 13.6\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of National Basketball Association career blocks leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff blocks leaders\n* List of NCAA Division I men's basketball career blocks leaders\n* List of NCAA Division I men's basketball season blocks leaders\n* List of NCAA Division I men's basketball career free throw scoring leaders\n* List of NCAA Division I men's basketball players with 2000 points and 1000 rebounds\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Mourning to head player development\". *ESPN.com*.
