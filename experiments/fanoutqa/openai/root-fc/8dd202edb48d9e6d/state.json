During the centralized growth of Japan's economy following World War II, many large firms moved their headquarters from cities such as Osaka (the historical commercial capital) to Tokyo, in an attempt to take advantage of better access to the government.

Twice in recent history has the metropolis been left in ruins: first in the 1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake and later after extensive firebombing in World War II.[87] Because of this, Tokyo's urban landscape consists mainly of modern and contemporary architecture, and older buildings are scarce.[87] Tokyo features many internationally famous forms of modern architecture including Tokyo International Forum, Asahi Beer Hall, Mode Gakuen Cocoon Tower, NTT Docomo Yoyogi Building and Rainbow Bridge. Tokyo features two distinctive towers: Tokyo Tower and Tokyo Skytree, the latter of which is the tallest tower in both Japan and the world, and the second tallest structure in the world after the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.[13] Mori Building Co started work on Tokyo's new tallest building which was set to be finished in March 2023. The project will cost 580\u00a0billion yen ($5.5\u00a0billion).[88]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nCapitals of Asia\n |\n| --- |\n| Dependent territories and states with limited recognition are in *italics*\n |\n| |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Central Asia | South Asia | Southeast Asia | West Asia |\n| * **Ashgabat**, Turkmenistan\n* **Astana**, Kazakhstan\n* **Bishkek**, Kyrgyzstan\n* **Dushanbe**, Tajikistan\n* **Tashkent**, Uzbekistan\n\n\n**East Asia**\n\n* **Beijing**, China\n* **Pyongyang**, North Korea\n* **Seoul**, South Korea\n* **Taipei**, *Taiwan*\n* **Tokyo**, Japan\n* **Ulaanbaatar**, Mongolia\n\n\n**North Asia**\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n14. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel\".

In 1603, however, the city ascended to political prominence after being named the seat of the Tokugawa shogunate. By the mid-18th century, Edo emerged as one of the world's most-populous cities with a population of over one\u00a0million people. Following the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the imperial capital in Kyoto was moved to Edo, and the city was renamed Tokyo (lit.\u2009'Eastern Capital'). In 1923, Tokyo was damaged substantially by the Great Kantt\u014d earthquake and was later decimated by allied bombing raids during World War II in retailiation for Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. \n\n\nSince 1943, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government has administered the prefecture's special wards, including Tokyo City), various commuter towns and suburbs in its western area, and two outlying island chains known as the Tokyo Islands.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

In the summer of 2014, S\u00e3o Paulo was affected by a heat wave that lasted for almost 4 weeks with highs above 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F), peaking on 36\u00a0\u00b0C (97\u00a0\u00b0F).

In winter, temperatures tend to range between 12 and 22\u00a0\u00b0C (54 and 72\u00a0\u00b0F). The record high temperature was 37.8\u00a0\u00b0C (100.0\u00a0\u00b0F) on 17 October 2014[60] and the lowest \u22123.2\u00a0\u00b0C (26.2\u00a0\u00b0F) on 25 June 1918.[61][62] The Tropic of Capricorn, at about 23\u00b027' S, passes through north of S\u00e3o Paulo and roughly marks the boundary between the tropical and temperate areas of South America. Because of its elevation, however, S\u00e3o Paulo experiences a more temperate climate.[63] The city experiences four seasons. The summer is warm and rainy. Autumn and spring are transitional seasons. Winter is the coldest season, with cloudiness around town and frequently polar air masses. Frosts occur sporadically in regions further away from the center, in some winters throughout the city.[64]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n148. **^** Federal Foreign Office (2011). \"Ausw\u00e4rtiges Amt \u2013 Brazil\". *auswaertiges-amt.de*.

Listed by the GaWC as an alpha global city, S\u00e3o Paulo is the most populous city outside of Asia and the world's 4th largest city proper by population. Additionally, S\u00e3o Paulo is the largest Portuguese-speaking city in the world. It exerts strong international influences in commerce, finance, arts and entertainment.[8] The city's name honors the Apostle, Saint Paul of Tarsus. The city's metropolitan area, the Greater S\u00e3o Paulo, ranks as the most populous in Brazil and the 12th most populous on Earth. The process of conurbation between the metropolitan areas around the Greater S\u00e3o Paulo (Campinas, Santos, Jundia\u00ed, Sorocaba and S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Campos) created the S\u00e3o Paulo Macrometropolis,[9] a megalopolis with more than 30 million inhabitants, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBecause S\u00e3o Paulo has urban sprawl, it uses a different definition for its metropolitan area alternately called the Expanded Metropolitan Complex of S\u00e3o Paulo and the S\u00e3o Paulo Macrometropolis.

In November 2009, the Ministry of Justice and the Brazilian Forum of Public Security published a survey that pointed to S\u00e3o Paulo as the safest Brazilian capital for young people. Between 2000 and 2010, the city of S\u00e3o Paulo reduced its homicide rate by 78%. According to data from the Map of Violence 2011, published by the Sangari Institute and the Ministry of Justice, the city of S\u00e3o Paulo has the lowest homicide rate per 100,000 inhabitants among all Brazilian capitals.\n\n\n\n### Social challenges[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Social issues in Brazil\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Crime rates consistently decreased in the 21st century. The citywide homicide rate was 6.56 in 2019, less than a fourth of the 27.38 national rate.[112]\n* Air quality[47] has steadily increased during the modern era.\n* The two major rivers crossing the city, Tiet\u00ea and Pinheiros, are highly polluted. A major project to clean up these rivers is underway.[32][33]\n* The Clean City Law or antibillboard, approved in 2007, focused on two main targets: anti-publicity and anti-commerce. Advertisers estimate that they removed 15,000 billboards and that more than 1,600 signs and 1,300 towering metal panels were dismantled by authorities.[113]\n* S\u00e3o Paulo metropolitan region, adopted vehicle restrictions from 1996 to 1998 to reduce air pollution during wintertime. Since 1997, a similar project was implemented throughout the year in the central area of S\u00e3o Paulo to improve traffic.[114]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ![Ivory Coast](image) Abidjan, Ivory Coast\n* ![Paraguay](image) Asunci\u00f3n, Paraguay\n* ![Spain](image) Barcelona, Spain\n* ![Portugal](image) Belmonte, Portugal\n* ![Romania](image) Cluj-Napoca, Romania\n* ![Cuba](image) Havana, Cuba\n* ![Turkey](image) \u0130zmir, Turkey\n* ![Peru](image) Lima, Peru\n* ![Macau](image) Macau, China\n* ![United States](image) Miami-Dade County, United States\n* ![Italy](image) Milan, Italy\n* ![Japan](image) Osaka, Japan\n* ![Bolivia](image) La Paz, Bolivia\n* ![Spain](image) San Crist\u00f3bal de La Laguna, Spain\n* ![Chile](image) Santiago, Chile\n* ![Spain](image) Santiago de Compostela, Spain\n* ![South Korea](image) Seoul, South Korea\n* ![China](image) Shanghai, China\n* ![Armenia](image) Yerevan, Armenia\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Economy of S\u00e3o Paulo, Economy of the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, and Economy of Brazil\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe problem of balanced water supply for the city - and for the metropolis, in general - is also a worrying issue: S\u00e3o Paulo has few sources of water in its own perimeter, having to seek it in distant hydrographic basins. The problem of water pollution is also aggravated by the irregular occupation of watershed areas, caused by urban expansion, driven by the difficulty of access to land and housing in central areas by the low-income population[55] and associated with real estate speculation and precariousness in new subdivisions. With this, there is also an overvaluation of individual transport over public transport \u2013 leading to the current rate of more than one vehicle for every two inhabitants and aggravating the problem of environmental pollution.[56]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Iguatemi Faria Lima, in Faria Lima Avenue, is Brazil's oldest mall, opened in 1966.[155] The Jardins neighborhood is regarded among the most sophisticated places in town, with upscale restaurants and hotels.

Species such as the rufous-bellied thrush, golden-chevroned tanager, great kiskadee and hummingbird are the most common. Despite the intense pollution, the main rivers of the city, the Tiet\u00ea and the Pinheiros, shelter several species of animals such as capybaras, hawks, southern lapwings, herons and nutrias.

In Brazil, the city of S\u00e3o Paulo has the largest number of doctors who can speak more than one language, which in this case is Portuguese, with the secondary languages predominantly are English and Spanish.[128]\n\n\nThe private health care sector is very large and most of Brazil's best hospitals are in the city. As of September 2009, the city of S\u00e3o Paulo had: 32,553 ambulatory clinics, centers and professional offices (physicians, dentists and others); 217 hospitals, with 32,554 beds; 137,745 health care professionals, including 28,316 physicians.[129]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Parais\u00f3polis, the largest slum (*favela*) in the city, with residential buildings in the background\n![](image)Public housing in Heli\u00f3polis\nSince the beginning of the 20th century, S\u00e3o Paulo has been a major economic center in Latin America. During two World Wars and the Great Depression, coffee exports (from other regions of the state) were critically affected.

In March 2011, more than 7 million vehicles were registered.[187] Heavy traffic is common on the city's main avenues and traffic jams are relatively common on its highways.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nStrongly supported by the State and the City of S\u00e3o Paulo government authorities, in 2010, the city hall of S\u00e3o Paulo invested R$1 million reais in the parade and provided a solid security plan, with approximately 2,000 policemen, two mobile police stations for immediate reporting of occurrences, 30 equipped ambulances, 55 nurses, 46 medical physicians, three hospital camps with 80 beds. The parade, considered the city's second largest event after the Formula One, begins at the S\u00e3o Paulo Museum of Art, crosses Paulista Avenue, and follows Consola\u00e7\u00e3o Street to Pra\u00e7a Roosevelt in Downtown S\u00e3o Paulo.

The UN pointed to S\u00e3o Paulo as an example of how big cities can reduce crime. Crime rates, such as homicide, have been steadily declining for 8 years. The number of murders in 2007 was 63% lower than in 1999. Carandiru's 9th DP is considered one of the five best police stations in the world and the best in Latin America.\n\n\nIn 2008, the city of S\u00e3o Paulo ranked 493rd in the list of the most violent cities in Brazil.

The city consumes an average of 221 liters of water/inhabitant/day while the UN recommends the consumption of 110 liters/day. The water loss is 30.8%. However, between 11 and 12.8% of households do not have a sewage system, depositing waste in pits and ditches. Sixty percent of the sewage collected is treated. According to data from IBGE and Eletropaulo, the electricity grid serves almost 100% of households. The fixed telephony network is still precarious, with coverage of 67.2%. Household garbage collection covers all regions of the municipality but is still insufficient, reaching around 94% of the demand in districts such as Parelheiros and Perus. About 80% of the garbage produced daily by Paulistas is exported to other cities, such as Caieiras and Guarulhos.[173] Recycling accounts for about 1% of the 15,000 metric tons of waste produced daily.[173]\n\n\n\n### Urban planning[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), in 2010 the population of S\u00e3o Paulo was 6,549,775 Roman Catholics (58.2%), 2,887,810 Protestants (22.1%), 531,822 Spiritists (4.7%), 101,493 Jehovah's Witnesses (0.9%), 75,075 Buddhists (0.7%), 50,794 Umbandists (0.5%), 43,610 Jews (0.4%), 28,673 Catholic Apostolic Brazilians (0.3%), 25,583 eastern religious (0.2%), 18,058 Candomblecists (0.2%), 17,321 Mormons (0.2%), 14,894 Eastern Orthodox (0.1%), 9,119 spiritualists (0.1%), 8,277 Muslims (0.1%), 7,139 esoteric (0.1%), 1,829 practiced Indian traditions (<0.1%) and 1,008 were Hindu (<0.1%).

With the First and Second World Wars and the Great Depression, coffee exports to the United States and Europe were heavily affected, forcing the rich coffee growers to invest in the industrial activities that would make S\u00e3o Paulo the largest industrial center in Brazil. The new job vacancies contributed to attract a significant number of immigrants (mainly from Italy)[171] and migrants, especially from the Northeastern states.[172] From a population of only 32.000 people in 1880, S\u00e3o Paulo now had 8.5 million inhabitants in 1980.

Among the largest municipalities, Guarulhos, with a population of more than 1 million people is the biggest one. Several others count more than 100,000 inhabitants, such as S\u00e3o Bernardo do Campo (811,000 inh.) and Santo Andr\u00e9 (707,000 inh.) in the ABC Region. The ABC Region, comprising Santo Andr\u00e9, S\u00e3o Bernardo do Campo and S\u00e3o Caetano do Sul in the south of Grande S\u00e3o Paulo, is an important location for industrial corporations, such as Volkswagen and Ford Motors.[108]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n223. **^** \"Arena \u2013 Allianz Parque\".

Between 1960 and 1980 the city's population more than doubled to nearly 9\u00a0million.[53]\n\n\nIn 1980 half of all the industrial jobs in Mexico were located in Mexico City. Under relentless growth, the Mexico City government could barely keep up with services. Villagers from the countryside who continued to pour into the city to escape poverty only compounded the city's problems. With no housing available, they took over lands surrounding the city, creating huge shantytowns that extended for many miles.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The Mexico City Megalopolis as defined prior to 2019.

Some of the policies enacted included the installation of 11,000 security cameras around the city and a very large expansion of the police force. Mexico City has one of the world's highest police officer-to-resident ratios, with one uniformed officer per 100 citizens.[152] Since 1997 the prison population has increased by more than 500%.[153] Political scientist Markus-Michael M\u00fcller argues that mostly informal street vendors are hit by these measures. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n125. **^** \"Asociaciones de Inmigrantes Extranjeros en la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico.

When the Federal District was created in 1824, the urban area of Mexico City extended approximately to the area of today's Cuauht\u00e9moc borough. At the beginning of the 20th century, the *elites* began migrating to the south and west and soon the small towns of Mixcoac and San \u00c1ngel were incorporated by the growing conurbation. According to the 1921 census, 54.78% of the city's population was considered Mestizo (Indigenous mixed with European), 22.79% considered European, and 18.74% considered Indigenous.[111] This was the last Mexican Census which asked people to self-identify with a heritage other than Amerindian.

Drainage was engineered through the use of canals and tunnels starting in the 17th century.[77][79]\n\n\nMexico City primarily rests on what was Lake Texcoco.[77] Seismic activity is frequent there.[80] Lake Texcoco was drained starting from the 17th century. Although none of the lake waters remain, the city rests on the lake bed's heavily saturated clay. This soft base is collapsing due to the over-extraction of groundwater, called *groundwater-related subsidence*.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMexico City was traditionally known as *La Ciudad de los Palacios* (\"the City of the Palaces\"), a nickname attributed to Baron Alexander von Humboldt when visiting the city in the 19th century, who, sending a letter back to Germany, said Mexico City could rival any major city in Europe. But it was English politician Charles Latrobe who really penned the following: \"... look at their works: the moles, aqueducts, churches, roads\u2014and the luxurious *City of Palaces* which has risen from the clay-builts ruins of Tenochtitlan...\", on page 84 of the Letter V of *The Rambler in Mexico*.[31]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Mexico City Arena\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAmong its many public and private schools (K\u201313), the city offers multi-cultural, multi-lingual and international schools attended by Mexican and foreign students.

This led to decentralization[166] and a shift in Mexico City's economic base, from manufacturing to services, as most factories moved away to either the State of Mexico, or more commonly to the northern border. By contrast, corporate office buildings set their base in the city.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEconomically, Mexico City prospered as a result of trade. Unlike Brazil or Peru, Mexico had easy contact with both the Atlantic and Pacific worlds. Although the Spanish crown tried to completely regulate all commerce in the city, it had only partial success.[59]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSnow falls in the city very rarely, although somewhat more often in nearby mountain tops. Throughout its history, the Central Valley of Mexico was accustomed to having several snowfalls per decade (including a period between 1878 and 1895 in which every single year\u2014except 1880\u2014recorded snowfalls[99]) mostly lake-effect snow. The effects of the draining of Lake Texcoco and global warming have greatly reduced snowfalls after the snow flurries of 12 February 1907.[100] Since 1908, snow has only fallen three times, snow on 14 February 1920;[101] snow flurries on 14 March 1940;[102] and on 12 January 1967, when 8 centimeters (3\u00a0in) of snow fell on the city, the most on record.[103] The 1967 snowstorm coincided with the operation of *Deep Drainage System* that resulted in the total draining of what was left of Lake Texcoco.[99][104] After the disappearance of Lake Texcoco, snow has never fallen again over Mexico City.[99] The region of the Valley of Mexico receives anti-cyclonic systems. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Biblioteca Vasconcelos\nThe Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos Library, a national library, is located on the grounds of the former Buenavista railroad station in the northern part of the city.

The theme park Six Flags M\u00e9xico (the largest amusement park in Latin America) is located in the Ajusco neighborhood, in Tlalpan borough, southern Mexico City.

There are a multitude of venues hosting Spanish and foreign-language performers. These include the 10,000-seat National Auditorium that regularly schedules the Spanish and English-language pop and rock artists, as well as many of the world's leading performing arts ensembles, the auditorium also broadcasts grand opera performances from New York's Metropolitan Opera on giant, high definition screens. In 2007 National Auditorium was selected world's best venue by multiple genre media. Other sites for pop-artist performances include the 3,000-seat Teatro Metropolitan, the 15,000-seat Palacio de los Deportes, and the larger 50,000-seat Foro Sol Stadium, where popular international artists perform on a regular basis. The Cirque du Soleil has held several seasons at the Carpa Santa Fe, in the Santa Fe district in the western part of the city. There are numerous venues for smaller musical ensembles and solo performers. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nCapitals of North America\n |\n| --- |\n| Dependent territories are in *italics*\n |\n| |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Basseterre, St. Kitts and Nevis\n* Belmopan, Belize\n* Bridgetown, Barbados\n* Castries, St. Lucia\n* *Charlotte Amalie, U.S. Virgin Islands (US)*\n* *Cockburn Town, Turks and Caicos (UK)*\n* *George Town, Cayman Islands (UK)*\n* Guatemala City, Guatemala\n* *Hamilton, Bermuda (UK)*\n* Havana, Cuba\n* Kingston, Jamaica\n* Kingstown, St. Vincent and the Grenadines\n | * Managua, Nicaragua\n* Mexico City, Mexico\n* Nassau, The Bahamas\n* Ottawa, (*National Capital Region*), Canada\n* Panama City, Panama\n* *Plymouth (de jure) \u2022 Brades (de facto), Montserrat (UK)*\n* Port-au-Prince, Haiti\n* Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago\n | * *Road Town, British Virgin Islands (UK)*\n* Roseau, Dominica\n* San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica\n* *San Juan, Puerto Rico (US)*\n* San Salvador, El Salvador\n* Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic\n* St. George's, Grenada\n* St. John's, Antigua and Barbuda\n* Tegucigalpa, Honduras\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)*The Conquest of Energy* by Jos\u00e9 Ch\u00e1vez Morado.\nThe National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), located in Mexico City, is the largest university on the continent, with more than 300,000 students from all backgrounds. Three Nobel laureates, several Mexican entrepreneurs and most of Mexico's modern-day presidents are among its former students. UNAM conducts 50% of Mexico's scientific research and has presence all across the country with satellite campuses, observatories and research centers. UNAM ranked 74th in the Top 200 World University Ranking published by Times Higher Education (then called Times Higher Education Supplement) in 2006,[133] making it the highest ranked Spanish-speaking university in the world. The sprawling main campus of the university, known as Ciudad Universitaria, was named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2007.[134]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Metrob\u00fas rapid transit bus stop station at Mina\nMexico City has an extensive bus network, consisting of public buses, bus rapid transit, and trolleybuses.\n\n\n\n### Roads[edit]\n\n\nMexico City has a large road network, and relatively high private car usage, estimated at more than 4.5 million in 2016.[177] There is an environmental program, called Hoy No Circula (\"Today Does Not Run\", or \"One Day without a Car\"), whereby vehicles that have not passed emissions testing are restricted from circulating on certain days according to the ending digit of their license plates, in an attempt to cut down on pollution and traffic congestion.[178][179][180]\n\n\n\n### Cycling[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ecobici (Mexico City)\n\n![](image)Bicycles available for rental in Zona Rosa\nThe Mexico City local government operates North America's second-largest bicycle sharing system, Ecobici. There are, as of September 2013, 276 stations with 4,000 bicycles across an area stretching from the Historic center to Polanco.[181][182][183]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe city grew as the population did, coming up against the lake's waters. As the depth of the lake water fluctuated, Mexico City was subject to periodic flooding. A major labor draft, the *desag\u00fce*, compelled thousands of indigenous over the colonial period to work on infrastructure to prevent flooding. Floods were not only an inconvenience but also a health hazard, since during flood periods human waste polluted the city's streets. By draining the area, the mosquito population dropped as did the frequency of the diseases they spread. However, draining the wetlands also changed the habitat for fish and birds and the areas accessible for indigenous cultivation close to the capital.[58] The 16th century saw a proliferation of churches, many of which can still be seen today in the historic center.[53]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe politics pursued by the administrations of heads of government in Mexico City at the end of the 20th century have usually been more liberal than those of the rest of the country,[144][145] whether with the support of the federal government, as was the case with the approval of several comprehensive environmental laws in the 1980s, or by laws that were since approved by the Legislative Assembly. The Legislative Assembly expanded provisions on abortions, becoming the first federal entity to expand abortion in Mexico beyond cases of rape and economic reasons, to permit it at the choice of the mother before the 12th week of pregnancy.[146] In December 2009, the then Federal District became the first city in Latin America and one of very few in the world to legalize same-sex marriage.[147]\n\n\n\n### Boroughs and neighborhoods[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Boroughs of Mexico City and Neighborhoods in Mexico City\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nVenustiano Carranza's Constitutionalist faction ultimately prevailed in the revolutionary civil war and Carranza took up residence in the presidential palace.\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera house in San \u00c1ngel designed by Juan O'Gorman\nIn the 20th century the phenomenal growth of the city and its environmental and political consequences dominate. In 1900, the population of Mexico City was about 500,000.[69] The city began to grow rapidly westward in the early part of the 20th century.[53] In the 1920s the Caracas exile community was forcefully relocated from Havana to Mexico City. As a consequence, Mexico City became the epicenter of anti-imperialism.[70]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe most recognizable icon of Mexico City is the golden Angel of Independence on the wide, elegant avenue Paseo de la Reforma, modeled by the order of the Emperor Maximilian of Mexico after the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris. This avenue was designed over the Americas' oldest known major roadway in the 19th century to connect the National Palace (seat of government) with the Castle of Chapultepec, the imperial residence. Today, this avenue is an important financial district in which the Mexican Stock Exchange and several corporate headquarters are located. Another important avenue is the Avenida de los Insurgentes, which extends 28.8\u00a0km (17.9\u00a0mi) and is one of the longest single avenues in the world.\n\n\nChapultepec Park houses the Chapultepec Castle, now a museum on a hill that overlooks the park and its numerous museums, monuments and the national zoo and the National Museum of Anthropology (which houses the Aztec Calendar Stone). \n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTo clean up pollution, the federal and local governments implemented numerous plans including the constant monitoring and reporting of environmental conditions, such as ozone and nitrogen oxides.[85] When the levels of these two pollutants reached critical levels, contingency actions were implemented which included closing factories, changing school hours, and extending the *A day without a car* program to two days of the week.[85] The government also instituted industrial technology improvements, a strict biannual vehicle emission inspection and the reformulation of gasoline and diesel fuels.[85] The introduction of Metrob\u00fas bus rapid transit and the Ecobici bike-sharing were among efforts to encourage alternate, greener forms of transportation.[84]\n\n\n\n### Parks and recreation[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
