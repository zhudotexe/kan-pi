During the centralized growth of Japan's economy following World War II, many large firms moved their headquarters from cities such as Osaka (the historical commercial capital) to Tokyo, in an attempt to take advantage of better access to the government. This trend has begun to slow due to ongoing population growth in Tokyo and the high cost of living there.\n\n\nTokyo was rated by the Economist Intelligence Unit as the most expensive (highest cost-of-living) city in the world for 14 years in a row ending in 2006, when it was replaced by Oslo, and later Paris.[101][102]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Climate data for Kitanomaru Park, Chiyoda, Tokyo (1991–2020 normals, extremes 1875–present)[75][76] |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 22.6(72.7)\n | 24.9(76.8)\n | 25.3(77.5)\n | 29.2(84.6)\n | 32.6(90.7)\n | 36.4(97.5)\n | 39.5(103.1)\n | 39.1(102.4)\n | 38.1(100.6)\n | 32.6(90.7)\n | 27.5(81.5)\n | 24.8(76.6)\n | 39.5(103.1)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 9.8(49.6)\n | 10.9(51.6)\n | 14.2(57.6)\n | 19.4(66.9)\n | 23.6(74.5)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n | 29.9(85.8)\n | 31.3(88.3)\n | 27.5(81.5)\n | 22.0(71.6)\n | 16.7(62.1)\n | 12.0(53.6)\n | 20.3(68.5)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 5.4(41.7)\n | 6.1(43.0)\n | 9.4(48.9)\n | 14.3(57.7)\n | 18.8(65.8)\n | 21.9(71.4)\n | 25.7(78.3)\n | 26.9(80.4)\n | 23.3(73.9)\n | 18.0(64.4)\n | 12.5(54.5)\n | 7.7(45.9)\n | 15.8(60.4)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 1.2(34.2)\n | 2.1(35.8)\n | 5.0(41.0)\n | 9.8(49.6)\n | 14.6(58.3)\n | 18.5(65.3)\n | 22.4(72.3)\n | 23.5(74.3)\n | 20.3(68.5)\n | 14.8(58.6)\n | 8.8(47.8)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2020, Tokyo ranked fourth on the Global Financial Centres Index behind New York City, London, and Shanghai.[12] The city is home to the world's tallest tower, Tokyo Skytree,[13] and the world's largest underground floodwater diversion facility, the Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel in Kasukabe, Saitama, a Tokyo suburb.[14] The Tokyo Metro Ginza Line, which opened in 1927, is the oldest underground metro line in East Asia.[15] Tokyo is recognized as one of the world's most livable cities; it was ranked fourth in the world in Global Livability Ranking, published in 2021.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* **Moscow**, Russia\n | * **Camp Thunder Cove**, *BIOT* (UK) **\\***\n* **Dhaka**, Bangladesh\n* **Islamabad**, Pakistan\n* **Kabul**, Afghanistan\n* **Kathmandu**, Nepal\n* **Malé**, Maldives\n* **New Delhi**, India\n* **Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte**, Sri Lanka\n* **Thimphu**, Bhutan\n | * **Bandar Seri Begawan**, Brunei\n* **Bangkok**, Thailand\n* **Dili**, East Timor\n* **Flying Fish Cove**, *Christmas Island* (Australia)\n* **Hanoi**, Vietnam\n* **Jakarta**, Indonesia\n* **Kuala Lumpur**, Malaysia\n* **Manila**, Philippines\n* **Naypyidaw**, Myanmar\n* **Phnom Penh**, Cambodia\n* **Singapore**\n* **Vientiane**, Laos\n* **West Island**, *Cocos (Keeling) Islands* (Australia)\n | * **Abu Dhabi**, United Arab Emirates\n* **Amman**, Jordan\n* **Ankara**, Turkey\n* **Baghdad**, Iraq\n* **Baku**, Azerbaijan\n* **Beirut**, Lebanon\n* **Damascus**, Syria\n* **Doha**, Qatar\n* **Episkopi Cantonment**, *Akrotiri and Dhekelia* (UK)\n* **Jerusalem**, Israel **\\***\n* **Kuwait City**, Kuwait\n* **Manama**, Bahrain\n | * **Muscat**, Oman\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −9.3(15.3)\n | −11.6(11.1)\n | −8.1(17.4)\n | −3.8(25.2)\n | 0.7(33.3)\n | 7.5(45.5)\n | 12.4(54.3)\n | 13.2(55.8)\n | 6.2(43.2)\n | 1.0(33.8)\n | −2.1(28.2)\n | −6.9(19.6)\n | −11.6(11.1)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 49.5(1.95)\n | 45.9(1.81)\n | 88.5(3.48)\n | 106.3(4.19)\n | 118.7(4.67)\n | 163.2(6.43)\n | 205.6(8.09)\n | 217.4(8.56)\n | 270.2(10.64)\n | 215.4(8.48)\n | 68.9(2.71)\n | 43.7(1.72)\n | 1,608(63.31)\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 206.5\n | 187.7\n | 173.0\n | 178.4\n | 172.2\n | 104.2\n | 124.8\n | 144.6\n | 104.5\n | 128.7\n | 164.5\n | 186.5\n | 1,874.6\n |\n| Source: Japan Meteorological Agency[82][83] |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n69. **^** Peel, M.C., Finlayson, B.L., and McMahon, T.A.: Updated world map of the Köppen-Geiger climate classification Archived February 10, 2017, at the Wayback Machine, Hydrol.

Twice in recent history has the metropolis been left in ruins: first in the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake and later after extensive firebombing in World War II.[87] Because of this, Tokyo's urban landscape consists mainly of modern and contemporary architecture, and older buildings are scarce.[87] Tokyo features many internationally famous forms of modern architecture including Tokyo International Forum, Asahi Beer Hall, Mode Gakuen Cocoon Tower, NTT Docomo Yoyogi Building and Rainbow Bridge. Tokyo features two distinctive towers: Tokyo Tower and Tokyo Skytree, the latter of which is the tallest tower in both Japan and the world, and the second tallest structure in the world after the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.[13] Mori Building Co started work on Tokyo's new tallest building which was set to be finished in March 2023.

Tokyo thus became the first Asian city to host the Olympic Games twice.[46] However, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 Olympic Games took place from July 23, 2021, to August 8, 2021. It is also unclear how the city will deal with an increasing number of issues, urging scholars to offer possible alternatives approaches to tackle the most urgent problems.[47] Although, the COVID-19 pandemic in Tokyo has impeded the growth of many industries, the real estate market in Japan is yet to be negatively impacted. Japanese real estate has become one of the safest investments for foreign investors around the world.[48]\n\n\n\n* Gallery\n* ![Tokyo Tower, built in 1958](image)\n\nTokyo Tower, built in 1958\n* ![Yoyogi National Gymnasium, built for the 1964 Summer Olympics](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n東京都\n |\n| --- |\n| Metropolis\n |\n| Tokyo Metropolis |\n| ![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n**Clockwise from top:*** Nishi-Shinjuku and Mount Fuji\n* Tokyo Tower\n* National Diet Building\n* Tokyo Station\n* Tokyo Imperial Palace\n* Shibuya Crossing\n* Tokyo Skytree\n* and Rainbow Bridge\n |\n| \n![Flag of Tokyo](image)Flag\n![Official seal of Tokyo](image)Seal\n![Official logo of Tokyo](image)Emblem\n |\n| Anthem: \"Tokyo Metropolitan Song\" (東京都歌, *Tōkyō-to Ka*) |\n| ![Map](image)Interactive map outlining Tokyo\n |\n| ![Location within Japan](image)Location within Japan\n |\n| Coordinates: 35°41′23″N 139°41′32″E﻿ / ﻿35.68972°N 139.69222°E﻿ / 35.68972; 139.69222 |\n| Country | Japan |\n| Region | Kantō |\n| Island | Honshu |\n| Capital | Tokyo[1] |\n| Divisions | 23 special wards, 26 cities, 1 district, and 4 subprefectures |\n| Government |\n|  • Body | Tokyo Metropolitan Government |\n|  • Governor | Yuriko Koike (Indp.) |\n|  • Representatives | 42 |\n|  • Councilors | 11 |\n| Area[2]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n102. **^** \"The expenses of Japan\". *The Economist*.

In 1603, however, the city ascended to political prominence after being named the seat of the Tokugawa shogunate. By the mid-18th century, Edo emerged as one of the world's most-populous cities with a population of over one million people. Following the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the imperial capital in Kyoto was moved to Edo, and the city was renamed Tokyo (lit. 'Eastern Capital'). In 1923, Tokyo was damaged substantially by the Great Kanttō earthquake and was later decimated by allied bombing raids during World War II in retailiation for Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. \n\n\nSince 1943, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government has administered the prefecture's special wards, including Tokyo City), various commuter towns and suburbs in its western area, and two outlying island chains known as the Tokyo Islands.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_mOE87RN0Mt6AFCDldQPlxEwZ","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

During the centralized growth of Japan's economy following World War II, many large firms moved their headquarters from cities such as Osaka (the historical commercial capital) to Tokyo, in an attempt to take advantage of better access to the government. This trend has begun to slow due to ongoing population growth in Tokyo and the high cost of living there.\n\n\nTokyo was rated by the Economist Intelligence Unit as the most expensive (highest cost-of-living) city in the world for 14 years in a row ending in 2006, when it was replaced by Oslo, and later Paris.[101][102]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Climate data for Kitanomaru Park, Chiyoda, Tokyo (1991–2020 normals, extremes 1875–present)[75][76] |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 22.6(72.7)\n | 24.9(76.8)\n | 25.3(77.5)\n | 29.2(84.6)\n | 32.6(90.7)\n | 36.4(97.5)\n | 39.5(103.1)\n | 39.1(102.4)\n | 38.1(100.6)\n | 32.6(90.7)\n | 27.5(81.5)\n | 24.8(76.6)\n | 39.5(103.1)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 9.8(49.6)\n | 10.9(51.6)\n | 14.2(57.6)\n | 19.4(66.9)\n | 23.6(74.5)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n | 29.9(85.8)\n | 31.3(88.3)\n | 27.5(81.5)\n | 22.0(71.6)\n | 16.7(62.1)\n | 12.0(53.6)\n | 20.3(68.5)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 5.4(41.7)\n | 6.1(43.0)\n | 9.4(48.9)\n | 14.3(57.7)\n | 18.8(65.8)\n | 21.9(71.4)\n | 25.7(78.3)\n | 26.9(80.4)\n | 23.3(73.9)\n | 18.0(64.4)\n | 12.5(54.5)\n | 7.7(45.9)\n | 15.8(60.4)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 1.2(34.2)\n | 2.1(35.8)\n | 5.0(41.0)\n | 9.8(49.6)\n | 14.6(58.3)\n | 18.5(65.3)\n | 22.4(72.3)\n | 23.5(74.3)\n | 20.3(68.5)\n | 14.8(58.6)\n | 8.8(47.8)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2020, Tokyo ranked fourth on the Global Financial Centres Index behind New York City, London, and Shanghai.[12] The city is home to the world's tallest tower, Tokyo Skytree,[13] and the world's largest underground floodwater diversion facility, the Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel in Kasukabe, Saitama, a Tokyo suburb.[14] The Tokyo Metro Ginza Line, which opened in 1927, is the oldest underground metro line in East Asia.[15] Tokyo is recognized as one of the world's most livable cities; it was ranked fourth in the world in Global Livability Ranking, published in 2021.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* **Moscow**, Russia\n | * **Camp Thunder Cove**, *BIOT* (UK) **\\***\n* **Dhaka**, Bangladesh\n* **Islamabad**, Pakistan\n* **Kabul**, Afghanistan\n* **Kathmandu**, Nepal\n* **Malé**, Maldives\n* **New Delhi**, India\n* **Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte**, Sri Lanka\n* **Thimphu**, Bhutan\n | * **Bandar Seri Begawan**, Brunei\n* **Bangkok**, Thailand\n* **Dili**, East Timor\n* **Flying Fish Cove**, *Christmas Island* (Australia)\n* **Hanoi**, Vietnam\n* **Jakarta**, Indonesia\n* **Kuala Lumpur**, Malaysia\n* **Manila**, Philippines\n* **Naypyidaw**, Myanmar\n* **Phnom Penh**, Cambodia\n* **Singapore**\n* **Vientiane**, Laos\n* **West Island**, *Cocos (Keeling) Islands* (Australia)\n | * **Abu Dhabi**, United Arab Emirates\n* **Amman**, Jordan\n* **Ankara**, Turkey\n* **Baghdad**, Iraq\n* **Baku**, Azerbaijan\n* **Beirut**, Lebanon\n* **Damascus**, Syria\n* **Doha**, Qatar\n* **Episkopi Cantonment**, *Akrotiri and Dhekelia* (UK)\n* **Jerusalem**, Israel **\\***\n* **Kuwait City**, Kuwait\n* **Manama**, Bahrain\n | * **Muscat**, Oman\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −9.3(15.3)\n | −11.6(11.1)\n | −8.1(17.4)\n | −3.8(25.2)\n | 0.7(33.3)\n | 7.5(45.5)\n | 12.4(54.3)\n | 13.2(55.8)\n | 6.2(43.2)\n | 1.0(33.8)\n | −2.1(28.2)\n | −6.9(19.6)\n | −11.6(11.1)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 49.5(1.95)\n | 45.9(1.81)\n | 88.5(3.48)\n | 106.3(4.19)\n | 118.7(4.67)\n | 163.2(6.43)\n | 205.6(8.09)\n | 217.4(8.56)\n | 270.2(10.64)\n | 215.4(8.48)\n | 68.9(2.71)\n | 43.7(1.72)\n | 1,608(63.31)\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 206.5\n | 187.7\n | 173.0\n | 178.4\n | 172.2\n | 104.2\n | 124.8\n | 144.6\n | 104.5\n | 128.7\n | 164.5\n | 186.5\n | 1,874.6\n |\n| Source: Japan Meteorological Agency[82][83] |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n69. **^** Peel, M.C., Finlayson, B.L., and McMahon, T.A.: Updated world map of the Köppen-Geiger climate classification Archived February 10, 2017, at the Wayback Machine, Hydrol.

Governor Shintaro Ishihara created Japan's first emissions cap system, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emission by a total of 25% by 2020 from the 2000 level.[89] Tokyo is an example of an urban heat island, and the phenomenon is especially serious in its special wards.[90][91] According to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government,[92] the annual mean temperature has increased by about 3 °C (5.4 °F) over the past 100 years. Tokyo has been cited as a \"convincing example of the relationship between urban growth and climate\".[90]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 18.2(64.8)\n | 21.2(70.2)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | 8.9(48.0)\n | 7.8(46.0)\n | 9.2(48.6)\n | 10.7(51.3)\n | 13.9(57.0)\n | 17.7(63.9)\n | 20.8(69.4)\n | 22.2(72.0)\n | 19.6(67.3)\n | 17.2(63.0)\n | 13.2(55.8)\n | 10.8(51.4)\n | 7.8(46.0)\n |\n| Average rainfall mm (inches)\n | 63.6(2.50)\n | 51.6(2.03)\n | 75.8(2.98)\n | 113.3(4.46)\n | 151.9(5.98)\n | 111.8(4.40)\n | 79.5(3.13)\n | 123.3(4.85)\n | 144.2(5.68)\n | 141.7(5.58)\n | 136.1(5.36)\n | 103.3(4.07)\n | 1,296.1(51.02)\n |\n| Average rainy days (≥ 0.5 mm) | 11.0\n | 8.5\n | 9.8\n | 10.0\n | 11.8\n | 8.8\n | 8.6\n | 11.3\n | 13.4\n | 13.7\n | 12.0\n | 11.2\n | 130.1\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 66\n | 68\n | 72\n | 79\n | 84\n | 86\n | 82\n | 82\n | 82\n | 81\n | 76\n | 70\n | 77\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 131.3\n | 138.3\n | 159.2\n | 148.3\n | 151.8\n | 205.6\n | 246.8\n | 213.7\n | 197.7\n | 173.2\n | 139.1\n | 125.3\n | 2,030.3\n |\n| Source: Japan Meteorological Agency[84][85] |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Climate data for Ogouchi, Okutama, Tokyo, 1991–2020 normals, extremes 1875–present\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 17.8(64.0)\n | 20.9(69.6)\n | 22.9(73.2)\n | 30.6(87.1)\n | 33.0(91.4)\n | 34.3(93.7)\n | 36.3(97.3)\n | 36.4(97.5)\n | 35.0(95.0)\n | 30.2(86.4)\n | 23.8(74.8)\n | 22.8(73.0)\n | 36.4(97.5)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 6.8(44.2)\n | 7.6(45.7)\n | 10.9(51.6)\n | 16.5(61.7)\n | 21.1(70.0)\n | 23.4(74.1)\n | 27.4(81.3)\n | 28.5(83.3)\n | 24.3(75.7)\n | 18.8(65.8)\n | 14.0(57.2)\n | 9.3(48.7)\n | 17.4(63.3)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 1.5(34.7)\n | 2.2(36.0)\n | 5.5(41.9)\n | 10.8(51.4)\n | 15.6(60.1)\n | 18.9(66.0)\n | 22.6(72.7)\n | 23.5(74.3)\n | 19.8(67.6)\n | 14.3(57.7)\n | 8.8(47.8)\n | 3.9(39.0)\n | 12.3(54.1)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | −2.4(27.7)\n | −1.9(28.6)\n | 1.0(33.8)\n | 5.8(42.4)\n | 10.9(51.6)\n | 15.3(59.5)\n | 19.3(66.7)\n | 20.1(68.2)\n | 16.6(61.9)\n | 10.9(51.6)\n | 5.0(41.0)\n | 0.1(32.2)\n | 8.4(47.1)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)Tokyo historical population since 1920 | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Registered foreign nationals**[99] |\n| Nationality | Population (2018)\n |\n| China | 199,949\n |\n| South Korea | 90,438\n |\n| Vietnam | 32,334\n |\n| Philippines | 32,089\n |\n| Nepal | 26,157\n |\n| Taiwan | 18,568\n |\n| North America (United States and Canada) | 17,578\n |\n| India | 11,153\n |\n| Myanmar | 9,719\n |\n| Thailand | 7,958\n |\n| Others | 75,557\n |\n\n |\n| ![](image)This chart is growth rate of municipalities of Tokyo, Japan.

Twice in recent history has the metropolis been left in ruins: first in the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake and later after extensive firebombing in World War II.[87] Because of this, Tokyo's urban landscape consists mainly of modern and contemporary architecture, and older buildings are scarce.[87] Tokyo features many internationally famous forms of modern architecture including Tokyo International Forum, Asahi Beer Hall, Mode Gakuen Cocoon Tower, NTT Docomo Yoyogi Building and Rainbow Bridge. Tokyo features two distinctive towers: Tokyo Tower and Tokyo Skytree, the latter of which is the tallest tower in both Japan and the world, and the second tallest structure in the world after the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.[13] Mori Building Co started work on Tokyo's new tallest building which was set to be finished in March 2023.

Tokyo thus became the first Asian city to host the Olympic Games twice.[46] However, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 Olympic Games took place from July 23, 2021, to August 8, 2021. It is also unclear how the city will deal with an increasing number of issues, urging scholars to offer possible alternatives approaches to tackle the most urgent problems.[47] Although, the COVID-19 pandemic in Tokyo has impeded the growth of many industries, the real estate market in Japan is yet to be negatively impacted. Japanese real estate has become one of the safest investments for foreign investors around the world.[48]\n\n\n\n* Gallery\n* ![Tokyo Tower, built in 1958](image)\n\nTokyo Tower, built in 1958\n* ![Yoyogi National Gymnasium, built for the 1964 Summer Olympics](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n東京都\n |\n| --- |\n| Metropolis\n |\n| Tokyo Metropolis |\n| ![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n**Clockwise from top:*** Nishi-Shinjuku and Mount Fuji\n* Tokyo Tower\n* National Diet Building\n* Tokyo Station\n* Tokyo Imperial Palace\n* Shibuya Crossing\n* Tokyo Skytree\n* and Rainbow Bridge\n |\n| \n![Flag of Tokyo](image)Flag\n![Official seal of Tokyo](image)Seal\n![Official logo of Tokyo](image)Emblem\n |\n| Anthem: \"Tokyo Metropolitan Song\" (東京都歌, *Tōkyō-to Ka*) |\n| ![Map](image)Interactive map outlining Tokyo\n |\n| ![Location within Japan](image)Location within Japan\n |\n| Coordinates: 35°41′23″N 139°41′32″E﻿ / ﻿35.68972°N 139.69222°E﻿ / 35.68972; 139.69222 |\n| Country | Japan |\n| Region | Kantō |\n| Island | Honshu |\n| Capital | Tokyo[1] |\n| Divisions | 23 special wards, 26 cities, 1 district, and 4 subprefectures |\n| Government |\n|  • Body | Tokyo Metropolitan Government |\n|  • Governor | Yuriko Koike (Indp.) |\n|  • Representatives | 42 |\n|  • Councilors | 11 |\n| Area[2]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n102. **^** \"The expenses of Japan\". *The Economist*.

In 1603, however, the city ascended to political prominence after being named the seat of the Tokugawa shogunate. By the mid-18th century, Edo emerged as one of the world's most-populous cities with a population of over one million people. Following the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the imperial capital in Kyoto was moved to Edo, and the city was renamed Tokyo (lit. 'Eastern Capital'). In 1923, Tokyo was damaged substantially by the Great Kanttō earthquake and was later decimated by allied bombing raids during World War II in retailiation for Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. \n\n\nSince 1943, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government has administered the prefecture's special wards, including Tokyo City), various commuter towns and suburbs in its western area, and two outlying island chains known as the Tokyo Islands.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_mOE87RN0Mt6AFCDldQPlxEwZ","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

The Laxminarayan Temple, Akshardham temple, Gurudwara Bangla Sahib, the Baháʼí Faith's Lotus Temple and the ISKCON temple are examples of modern architecture. Raj Ghat and associated memorials houses memorials of Mahatma Gandhi and other notable personalities.

Winters are temperate to cold and damp—northwesterly winds from Siberia can cause nighttime temperatures to drop below freezing. Each year, there are an average of 6.2 days with snowfall and 2.8 days with snow cover.[73] Summers are hot and humid, and occasional downpours or freak thunderstorms can be expected. On average, 8.7 days exceed 35 °C (95 °F) annually.

Listed by the GaWC as an alpha global city, São Paulo is the most populous city outside of Asia and the world's 4th largest city proper by population. Additionally, São Paulo is the largest Portuguese-speaking city in the world. It exerts strong international influences in commerce, finance, arts and entertainment.[8] The city's name honors the Apostle, Saint Paul of Tarsus. The city's metropolitan area, the Greater São Paulo, ranks as the most populous in Brazil and the 12th most populous on Earth. The process of conurbation between the metropolitan areas around the Greater São Paulo (Campinas, Santos, Jundiaí, Sorocaba and São José dos Campos) created the São Paulo Macrometropolis,[9] a megalopolis with more than 30 million inhabitants, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBecause São Paulo has urban sprawl, it uses a different definition for its metropolitan area alternately called the Expanded Metropolitan Complex of São Paulo and the São Paulo Macrometropolis. Analogous to the BosWash definition, it is one of the largest urban agglomerations in the world, with 32 million inhabitants,[109] behind Tokyo, which includes four contiguous legally defined metropolitan regions and three micro-regions.\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\n| Religion in São Paulo (2010 Census)[110] |\n| --- |\n| Religion |  | Percent |\n| Roman Catholicism |  | 58.2% |\n| Protestantism |  | 22.1% |\n| No religion |  | 9.38% |\n| Spiritism |  | 4.73% |\n| Others |  | 4.25% |\n| Other Christians |  | 1.33% |\n\nSee also: Religion in Brazil, Protestantism in Brazil, and Roman Catholic Church in Brazil\n\n![](image)\nSão Paulo Metropolitan Cathedral\n![](image)\nOrthodox Cathedral of São Paulo\n![](image)\nTemple of Solomon of the UCKG\n![](image)\nBuddhist Lohan Temple, Liberdade\n![](image)\nBrás mosque\n![](image)\nBeth El Synagogue\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n161. **^** \"Parada Gay é evento que atrai mais turistas a SP, diz SPTuris\" (in Portuguese).

Neither São Paulo nor the nearby coast has ever been hit by a tropical cyclone and tornadic activity is uncommon. During late winter, especially August, the city experiences the phenomenon known as *\"veranico\"* or *\"verãozinho\"* (\"little summer\"), which consists of hot and dry weather, sometimes reaching temperatures well above 28 °C (82 °F). On the other hand, relatively cool days during summer are fairly common when persistent winds blow from the ocean. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSão Paulo's economy is going through a deep transformation. Once a city with a strong industrial character, São Paulo's economy has followed the global trend of shifting to the tertiary sector of the economy, focusing on services. The city is unique among Brazilian cities for its large number of foreign corporations.[147]\n\n\n63% of all the international companies with business in Brazil have their head offices in São Paulo. São Paulo has one of the largest concentrations of German businesses worldwide[148] and is the largest Swedish industrial hub alongside Gothenburg.[149]\n\n\nSão Paulo ranked second after New York in FDi magazine's bi-annual ranking of Cities of the Future 2013–14 in the Americas, and was named the Latin American City of the Future 2013–14, overtaking Santiago de Chile, the first city in the previous ranking.

The problem of water pollution is also aggravated by the irregular occupation of watershed areas, caused by urban expansion, driven by the difficulty of access to land and housing in central areas by the low-income population[55] and associated with real estate speculation and precariousness in new subdivisions. With this, there is also an overvaluation of individual transport over public transport – leading to the current rate of more than one vehicle for every two inhabitants and aggravating the problem of environmental pollution.[56]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Iguatemi Faria Lima, in Faria Lima Avenue, is Brazil's oldest mall, opened in 1966.[155] The Jardins neighborhood is regarded among the most sophisticated places in town, with upscale restaurants and hotels.

This can includes hospitals, private practices and pharmacies. The city of São Paulo has the largest number of foreigners comparing with any other Brazilian city and an intense health tourism. In Brazil, the city of São Paulo has the largest number of doctors who can speak more than one language, which in this case is Portuguese, with the secondary languages predominantly are English and Spanish.[128]\n\n\nThe private health care sector is very large and most of Brazil's best hospitals are in the city. As of September 2009, the city of São Paulo had: 32,553 ambulatory clinics, centers and professional offices (physicians, dentists and others); 217 hospitals, with 32,554 beds; 137,745 health care professionals, including 28,316 physicians.[129]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Paraisópolis, the largest slum (*favela*) in the city, with residential buildings in the background\n![](image)Public housing in Heliópolis\nSince the beginning of the 20th century, São Paulo has been a major economic center in Latin America. During two World Wars and the Great Depression, coffee exports (from other regions of the state) were critically affected. This led wealthy coffee farmers to invest in industrial activities that turned São Paulo into Brazil's largest industrial hub.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAutomobiles are the main means to get into the city. In March 2011, more than 7 million vehicles were registered.[187] Heavy traffic is common on the city's main avenues and traffic jams are relatively common on its highways.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nStrongly supported by the State and the City of São Paulo government authorities, in 2010, the city hall of São Paulo invested R$1 million reais in the parade and provided a solid security plan, with approximately 2,000 policemen, two mobile police stations for immediate reporting of occurrences, 30 equipped ambulances, 55 nurses, 46 medical physicians, three hospital camps with 80 beds. The parade, considered the city's second largest event after the Formula One, begins at the São Paulo Museum of Art, crosses Paulista Avenue, and follows Consolação Street to Praça Roosevelt in Downtown São Paulo. According to the LGBT app Grindr, the gay parade of the city was elected the best in the world.[121]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Education in Brazil and Brazilian science and technology\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Training of soldiers of the Military Police of São Paulo State at the Military Police Academy of Barro Branco\nAccording to the 2011 Global Homicide Survey released by the United Nations, in the period between 2004 and 2009 the homicide rate dropped from 20.8 to 10.8 murders per 100,000 inhabitants. The UN pointed to São Paulo as an example of how big cities can reduce crime. Crime rates, such as homicide, have been steadily declining for 8 years. The number of murders in 2007 was 63% lower than in 1999. Carandiru's 9th DP is considered one of the five best police stations in the world and the best in Latin America.\n\n\nIn 2008, the city of São Paulo ranked 493rd in the list of the most violent cities in Brazil. Among the capitals, it was the fourth least violent, registering, in 2006, homicide rates higher than those of Boa Vista, Palmas and Natal.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSão Paulo is practically all served by the water supply network. The city consumes an average of 221 liters of water/inhabitant/day while the UN recommends the consumption of 110 liters/day. The water loss is 30.8%. However, between 11 and 12.8% of households do not have a sewage system, depositing waste in pits and ditches. Sixty percent of the sewage collected is treated. According to data from IBGE and Eletropaulo, the electricity grid serves almost 100% of households. The fixed telephony network is still precarious, with coverage of 67.2%. Household garbage collection covers all regions of the municipality but is still insufficient, reaching around 94% of the demand in districts such as Parelheiros and Perus. About 80% of the garbage produced daily by Paulistas is exported to other cities, such as Caieiras and Guarulhos.[173] Recycling accounts for about 1% of the 15,000 metric tons of waste produced daily.[173]\n\n\n\n### Urban planning[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), in 2010 the population of São Paulo was 6,549,775 Roman Catholics (58.2%), 2,887,810 Protestants (22.1%), 531,822 Spiritists (4.7%), 101,493 Jehovah's Witnesses (0.9%), 75,075 Buddhists (0.7%), 50,794 Umbandists (0.5%), 43,610 Jews (0.4%), 28,673 Catholic Apostolic Brazilians (0.3%), 25,583 eastern religious (0.2%), 18,058 Candomblecists (0.2%), 17,321 Mormons (0.2%), 14,894 Eastern Orthodox (0.1%), 9,119 spiritualists (0.1%), 8,277 Muslims (0.1%), 7,139 esoteric (0.1%), 1,829 practiced Indian traditions (<0.1%) and 1,008 were Hindu (<0.1%).

Another airport, the Campo de Marte Airport, serves private jets and light aircraft. The three airports together moved more than 58.000.000 passengers in 2015, making São Paulo one of the top 15 busiest in the world, by number of air passenger movements. The region of Greater São Paulo is also served by Viracopos International Airport, São José dos Campos Airport and Jundiaí Airport.\n\n\nCongonhas Airport operates flights mainly to Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre, Belo Horizonte and Brasília. Built in the 1930s, it was designed to handle the increasing demand for flights, in the fastest growing city in the world. Located in Campo Belo District, Congonhas Airport is close to the three main city's financial districts: Paulista Avenue, Brigadeiro Faria Lima Avenue and Engenheiro Luís Carlos Berrini Avenue.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Octávio Frias de Oliveira Bridge aside of *Centro Empresarial Nações Unidas*\nSince the beginning of the 20th century, São Paulo has been one of the main economic centers of Latin America. With the First and Second World Wars and the Great Depression, coffee exports to the United States and Europe were heavily affected, forcing the rich coffee growers to invest in the industrial activities that would make São Paulo the largest industrial center in Brazil. The new job vacancies contributed to attract a significant number of immigrants (mainly from Italy)[171] and migrants, especially from the Northeastern states.[172] From a population of only 32.000 people in 1880, São Paulo now had 8.5 million inhabitants in 1980. The rapid population growth has brought many problems for the city.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Satellite view of Greater São Paulo at night\nThe nonspecific term \"Grande São Paulo\" (\"*Greater São Paulo*\") covers multiple definitions. The legally defined *Região Metropolitana de São Paulo* consists of 39 municipalities in total and a population of 21.1 million[107] inhabitants (as of the 2014 National Census[update]).\n\n\nThe Metropolitan Region of São Paulo is known as the financial, economic, and cultural center of Brazil. Among the largest municipalities, Guarulhos, with a population of more than 1 million people is the biggest one. Several others count more than 100,000 inhabitants, such as São Bernardo do Campo (811,000 inh.) and Santo André (707,000 inh.) in the ABC Region. The ABC Region, comprising Santo André, São Bernardo do Campo and São Caetano do Sul in the south of Grande São Paulo, is an important location for industrial corporations, such as Volkswagen and Ford Motors.[108]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n223. **^** \"Arena – Allianz Parque\".

Because of its elevation, however, São Paulo experiences a more temperate climate.[63] The city experiences four seasons. The summer is warm and rainy. Autumn and spring are transitional seasons. Winter is the coldest season, with cloudiness around town and frequently polar air masses. Frosts occur sporadically in regions further away from the center, in some winters throughout the city.[64]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n148. **^** Federal Foreign Office (2011). \"Auswärtiges Amt – Brazil\". *auswaertiges-amt.de*.

Additionally, São Paulo is the largest Portuguese-speaking city in the world. It exerts strong international influences in commerce, finance, arts and entertainment.[8] The city's name honors the Apostle, Saint Paul of Tarsus. The city's metropolitan area, the Greater São Paulo, ranks as the most populous in Brazil and the 12th most populous on Earth. The process of conurbation between the metropolitan areas around the Greater São Paulo (Campinas, Santos, Jundiaí, Sorocaba and São José dos Campos) created the São Paulo Macrometropolis,[9] a megalopolis with more than 30 million inhabitants, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBecause São Paulo has urban sprawl, it uses a different definition for its metropolitan area alternately called the Expanded Metropolitan Complex of São Paulo and the São Paulo Macrometropolis. Analogous to the BosWash definition, it is one of the largest urban agglomerations in the world, with 32 million inhabitants,[109] behind Tokyo, which includes four contiguous legally defined metropolitan regions and three micro-regions.\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\n| Religion in São Paulo (2010 Census)[110] |\n| --- |\n| Religion |  | Percent |\n| Roman Catholicism |  | 58.2% |\n| Protestantism |  | 22.1% |\n| No religion |  | 9.38% |\n| Spiritism |  | 4.73% |\n| Others |  | 4.25% |\n| Other Christians |  | 1.33% |\n\nSee also: Religion in Brazil, Protestantism in Brazil, and Roman Catholic Church in Brazil\n\n![](image)\nSão Paulo Metropolitan Cathedral\n![](image)\nOrthodox Cathedral of São Paulo\n![](image)\nTemple of Solomon of the UCKG\n![](image)\nBuddhist Lohan Temple, Liberdade\n![](image)\nBrás mosque\n![](image)\nBeth El Synagogue\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n161. **^** \"Parada Gay é evento que atrai mais turistas a SP, diz SPTuris\" (in Portuguese).

Neither São Paulo nor the nearby coast has ever been hit by a tropical cyclone and tornadic activity is uncommon. During late winter, especially August, the city experiences the phenomenon known as *\"veranico\"* or *\"verãozinho\"* (\"little summer\"), which consists of hot and dry weather, sometimes reaching temperatures well above 28 °C (82 °F). On the other hand, relatively cool days during summer are fairly common when persistent winds blow from the ocean. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSão Paulo's economy is going through a deep transformation. Once a city with a strong industrial character, São Paulo's economy has followed the global trend of shifting to the tertiary sector of the economy, focusing on services. The city is unique among Brazilian cities for its large number of foreign corporations.[147]\n\n\n63% of all the international companies with business in Brazil have their head offices in São Paulo. São Paulo has one of the largest concentrations of German businesses worldwide[148] and is the largest Swedish industrial hub alongside Gothenburg.[149]\n\n\nSão Paulo ranked second after New York in FDi magazine's bi-annual ranking of Cities of the Future 2013–14 in the Americas, and was named the Latin American City of the Future 2013–14, overtaking Santiago de Chile, the first city in the previous ranking.

In Brazil, the city of São Paulo has the largest number of doctors who can speak more than one language, which in this case is Portuguese, with the secondary languages predominantly are English and Spanish.[128]\n\n\nThe private health care sector is very large and most of Brazil's best hospitals are in the city. As of September 2009, the city of São Paulo had: 32,553 ambulatory clinics, centers and professional offices (physicians, dentists and others); 217 hospitals, with 32,554 beds; 137,745 health care professionals, including 28,316 physicians.[129]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Paraisópolis, the largest slum (*favela*) in the city, with residential buildings in the background\n![](image)Public housing in Heliópolis\nSince the beginning of the 20th century, São Paulo has been a major economic center in Latin America.

However, between 11 and 12.8% of households do not have a sewage system, depositing waste in pits and ditches. Sixty percent of the sewage collected is treated. According to data from IBGE and Eletropaulo, the electricity grid serves almost 100% of households. The fixed telephony network is still precarious, with coverage of 67.2%. Household garbage collection covers all regions of the municipality but is still insufficient, reaching around 94% of the demand in districts such as Parelheiros and Perus. About 80% of the garbage produced daily by Paulistas is exported to other cities, such as Caieiras and Guarulhos.[173] Recycling accounts for about 1% of the 15,000 metric tons of waste produced daily.[173]\n\n\n\n### Urban planning[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), in 2010 the population of São Paulo was 6,549,775 Roman Catholics (58.2%), 2,887,810 Protestants (22.1%), 531,822 Spiritists (4.7%), 101,493 Jehovah's Witnesses (0.9%), 75,075 Buddhists (0.7%), 50,794 Umbandists (0.5%), 43,610 Jews (0.4%), 28,673 Catholic Apostolic Brazilians (0.3%), 25,583 eastern religious (0.2%), 18,058 Candomblecists (0.2%), 17,321 Mormons (0.2%), 14,894 Eastern Orthodox (0.1%), 9,119 spiritualists (0.1%), 8,277 Muslims (0.1%), 7,139 esoteric (0.1%), 1,829 practiced Indian traditions (<0.1%) and 1,008 were Hindu (<0.1%).

With the First and Second World Wars and the Great Depression, coffee exports to the United States and Europe were heavily affected, forcing the rich coffee growers to invest in the industrial activities that would make São Paulo the largest industrial center in Brazil. The new job vacancies contributed to attract a significant number of immigrants (mainly from Italy)[171] and migrants, especially from the Northeastern states.[172] From a population of only 32.000 people in 1880, São Paulo now had 8.5 million inhabitants in 1980.

By 2014 carbon monoxide pollution had dropped drastically, while sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide were at levels about a third of those in 1992. The levels of signature pollutants in Mexico City are similar to those of Los Angeles.[83] Despite the cleanup, the metropolitan area is still the most ozone-polluted part of the country, with ozone levels 2.5 times beyond WHO-defined safe limits.[84]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. **^** Agren, David (29 January 2016). \"Mexico City officially changes its name to – Mexico City\". *The Guardian*.

While still growing, the annual rate of growth has decreased and is lower than that of Greater Guadalajara and Greater Monterrey.[114]\n\n\nThe net migration rate of Mexico City proper from 1995 to 2000 was negative,[118] which implies that residents are moving to the suburbs of the metropolitan area, or to other states of Mexico.

Between 1960 and 1980 the city's population more than doubled to nearly 9 million.[53]\n\n\nIn 1980 half of all the industrial jobs in Mexico were located in Mexico City. Under relentless growth, the Mexico City government could barely keep up with services. Villagers from the countryside who continued to pour into the city to escape poverty only compounded the city's problems. With no housing available, they took over lands surrounding the city, creating huge shantytowns that extended for many miles.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The Mexico City Megalopolis as defined prior to 2019.

The megalopolis as defined by the Environmental Commission of the Megalopolis (*CAMe*) covers Mexico City and the states of Mexico, Hidalgo, Puebla, Tlaxcala, Morelos, and since 2019, Querétaro,[116] thus encompassing the metropolitan areas of Mexico City, Puebla, Querétaro, Toluca, Cuernavaca, Pachuca, and others.[117]\n\n\n\n#### Growth[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nPan American Games host cities\n |\n| --- |\n| Summer | * **1951:** ![Argentina](image) Buenos Aires\n* **1955:** ![Mexico](image) Mexico City\n* **1959:** ![United States](image) Chicago\n* **1963:** ![Brazil](image) São Paulo\n* **1967:** ![Canada](image) Winnipeg\n* **1971:** ![Colombia](image) Cali\n* **1975:** ![Mexico](image) Mexico City\n* **1979:** ![Puerto Rico](image) San Juan\n* **1983:** ![Venezuela](image) Caracas\n* **1987:** ![United States](image) Indianapolis\n* **1991:** ![Cuba](image) Havana\n* **1995:** ![Argentina](image) Mar del Plata\n* **1999:** ![Canada](image) Winnipeg\n* **2003:** ![Dominican Republic](image) Santo Domingo\n* **2007:** ![Brazil](image) Rio de Janeiro\n* **2011:** ![Mexico](image) Guadalajara\n* **2015:** ![Canada](image) Toronto\n* **2019:** ![Peru](image) Lima\n* ***2023:** ![Chile](image) Santiago*\n* ***2027:** ![Colombia](image) Barranquilla*\n |\n| Winter | * **1990:** ![Argentina](image) Las Leñas\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBetween 2000 and 2004 an average of 478 crimes were reported each day in Mexico City; however, the actual crime rate is thought to be much higher \"since most people are reluctant to report crime\".[151] Under policies enacted by Mayor Marcelo Ebrard between 2009 and 2011, Mexico City underwent a major security upgrade with violent and petty crime rates both falling significantly despite the rise in violent crime in other parts of the country. Some of the policies enacted included the installation of 11,000 security cameras around the city and a very large expansion of the police force. Mexico City has one of the world's highest police officer-to-resident ratios, with one uniformed officer per 100 citizens.[152] Since 1997 the prison population has increased by more than 500%.[153] Political scientist Markus-Michael Müller argues that mostly informal street vendors are hit by these measures. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n125. **^** \"Asociaciones de Inmigrantes Extranjeros en la Ciudad de México.

Landmarks in the Historic Center include the Plaza de la Constitución (Zócalo), the main central square with its epoch-contrasting Spanish-era Metropolitan Cathedral and National Palace, ancient Aztec temple ruins Templo Mayor (\"Major Temple\") and modern structures, all within a few steps of one another.

When the Federal District was created in 1824, the urban area of Mexico City extended approximately to the area of today's Cuauhtémoc borough. At the beginning of the 20th century, the *elites* began migrating to the south and west and soon the small towns of Mixcoac and San Ángel were incorporated by the growing conurbation. According to the 1921 census, 54.78% of the city's population was considered Mestizo (Indigenous mixed with European), 22.79% considered European, and 18.74% considered Indigenous.[111] This was the last Mexican Census which asked people to self-identify with a heritage other than Amerindian.

This valley is located in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt in the high plateaus of south-central Mexico.[77][78]\n\n\nIt has a minimum altitude of 2,200 meters (7,200 feet) above sea level and is surrounded by mountains and volcanoes that reach elevations of over 5,000 meters (16,000 feet).[79] This valley has no natural drainage outlet for the waters that flow from the mountainsides, making the city vulnerable to flooding. Drainage was engineered through the use of canals and tunnels starting in the 17th century.[77][79]\n\n\nMexico City primarily rests on what was Lake Texcoco.[77] Seismic activity is frequent there.[80] Lake Texcoco was drained starting from the 17th century. Although none of the lake waters remain, the city rests on the lake bed's heavily saturated clay. This soft base is collapsing due to the over-extraction of groundwater, called *groundwater-related subsidence*.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMexico City was traditionally known as *La Ciudad de los Palacios* (\"the City of the Palaces\"), a nickname attributed to Baron Alexander von Humboldt when visiting the city in the 19th century, who, sending a letter back to Germany, said Mexico City could rival any major city in Europe. But it was English politician Charles Latrobe who really penned the following: \"... look at their works: the moles, aqueducts, churches, roads—and the luxurious *City of Palaces* which has risen from the clay-builts ruins of Tenochtitlan...\", on page 84 of the Letter V of *The Rambler in Mexico*.[31]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Mexico City Arena\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAmong its many public and private schools (K–13), the city offers multi-cultural, multi-lingual and international schools attended by Mexican and foreign students.

Due to the limited non-urbanized space at the south—most of which is protected through environmental laws—the contribution of Mexico City in agriculture is the smallest of all federal entities in the country.[162] The economic reforms of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari had a tremendous effect on the city, as a number of businesses, including banks and airlines, were privatized. He also signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). This led to decentralization[166] and a shift in Mexico City's economic base, from manufacturing to services, as most factories moved away to either the State of Mexico, or more commonly to the northern border. By contrast, corporate office buildings set their base in the city.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEconomically, Mexico City prospered as a result of trade.

Throughout its history, the Central Valley of Mexico was accustomed to having several snowfalls per decade (including a period between 1878 and 1895 in which every single year—except 1880—recorded snowfalls[99]) mostly lake-effect snow. The effects of the draining of Lake Texcoco and global warming have greatly reduced snowfalls after the snow flurries of 12 February 1907.[100] Since 1908, snow has only fallen three times, snow on 14 February 1920;[101] snow flurries on 14 March 1940;[102] and on 12 January 1967, when 8 centimeters (3 in) of snow fell on the city, the most on record.[103] The 1967 snowstorm coincided with the operation of *Deep Drainage System* that resulted in the total draining of what was left of Lake Texcoco.[99][104] After the disappearance of Lake Texcoco, snow has never fallen again over Mexico City.[99] The region of the Valley of Mexico receives anti-cyclonic systems. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Biblioteca Vasconcelos\nThe José Vasconcelos Library, a national library, is located on the grounds of the former Buenavista railroad station in the northern part of the city.

During the winter, the main square of the Zócalo is transformed into a gigantic ice skating rink, which is said to be the largest in the world behind that of Moscow's Red Square.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image) Media related to Mexico City at Wikimedia Commons\n* ![](image) Geographic data related to Mexico City at OpenStreetMap\n* Mexico City Government (in Spanish)\n* Mexico City Tourism Ministry Archived 30 July 2013 at the Wayback Machine (in Spanish)\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMexico City\n |\n| --- |\n| Topics | * Administrative divisions\n\t+ Boroughs\n\t+ Neighborhoods\n\t+ Barrios Mágicos\n* Airport\n* Architecture\n\t+ Archaeological sites\n\t+ Colonial government and civil buildings\n\t+ Colonial churches\n\t+ Skyscrapers\n* Downtown\n* Folk art\n* Gentrification\n* Government\n\t+ Constituent Assembly\n\t+ Federal District buildings\n\t+ Heads of government\n\t+ Law enforcement\n\t+ Legislative Assembly\n* History\n\t+ Timeline\n* Metropolitan area\n* Parking\n* Pollution\n* Street vendors\n* Transport\n* Water management\n | ![Coat of arms of Mexico City](image)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPortals:* ![flag](image) Mexico\n* ![map](image) North America\n* ![](image) Mesoamerica\n* ![map](image) Latin America\n* ![icon](image) Geography\n**Mexico City** at Wikipedia's sister projects:\n* ![](image)**Definitions** from Wiktionary\n* ![](image)**Media** from Commons\n* ![](image)**News** from Wikinews\n* ![](image)**Quotations** from Wikiquote\n* ![](image)**Texts** from Wikisource\n* ![](image)**Textbooks** from Wikibooks\n* ![](image)**Resources** from Wikiversity\n* ![](image)**Travel guides** from Wikivoyage\n* ![](image)**Data** from Wikidata\n\n| Authority control databases ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n |\n| --- |\n| International | * FAST\n* ISNI\n* VIAF\n* WorldCat\n |\n| National | * Norway\n* Chile\n* Spain\n* France\n* BnF data\n* Argentina\n* Catalonia\n* Germany\n* Israel\n* United States\n* Japan\n* Czech Republic\n* Australia\n* Greece\n* Croatia\n* Poland\n |\n| Geographic | * MusicBrainz area\n |\n| Academics | * CiNii\n |\n| Other | * NARA\n* IdRef\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe city is also a leading center of popular culture and music. There are a multitude of venues hosting Spanish and foreign-language performers. These include the 10,000-seat National Auditorium that regularly schedules the Spanish and English-language pop and rock artists, as well as many of the world's leading performing arts ensembles, the auditorium also broadcasts grand opera performances from New York's Metropolitan Opera on giant, high definition screens. In 2007 National Auditorium was selected world's best venue by multiple genre media. Other sites for pop-artist performances include the 3,000-seat Teatro Metropolitan, the 15,000-seat Palacio de los Deportes, and the larger 50,000-seat Foro Sol Stadium, where popular international artists perform on a regular basis. The Cirque du Soleil has held several seasons at the Carpa Santa Fe, in the Santa Fe district in the western part of the city. There are numerous venues for smaller musical ensembles and solo performers. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nCapitals of North America\n |\n| --- |\n| Dependent territories are in *italics*\n |\n| |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Basseterre, St. Kitts and Nevis\n* Belmopan, Belize\n* Bridgetown, Barbados\n* Castries, St. Lucia\n* *Charlotte Amalie, U.S. Virgin Islands (US)*\n* *Cockburn Town, Turks and Caicos (UK)*\n* *George Town, Cayman Islands (UK)*\n* Guatemala City, Guatemala\n* *Hamilton, Bermuda (UK)*\n* Havana, Cuba\n* Kingston, Jamaica\n* Kingstown, St. Vincent and the Grenadines\n | * Managua, Nicaragua\n* Mexico City, Mexico\n* Nassau, The Bahamas\n* Ottawa, (*National Capital Region*), Canada\n* Panama City, Panama\n* *Plymouth (de jure) • Brades (de facto), Montserrat (UK)*\n* Port-au-Prince, Haiti\n* Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago\n | * *Road Town, British Virgin Islands (UK)*\n* Roseau, Dominica\n* San José, Costa Rica\n* *San Juan, Puerto Rico (US)*\n* San Salvador, El Salvador\n* Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic\n* St. George's, Grenada\n* St. John's, Antigua and Barbuda\n* Tegucigalpa, Honduras\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)*The Conquest of Energy* by José Chávez Morado.\nThe National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), located in Mexico City, is the largest university on the continent, with more than 300,000 students from all backgrounds. Three Nobel laureates, several Mexican entrepreneurs and most of Mexico's modern-day presidents are among its former students. UNAM conducts 50% of Mexico's scientific research and has presence all across the country with satellite campuses, observatories and research centers. UNAM ranked 74th in the Top 200 World University Ranking published by Times Higher Education (then called Times Higher Education Supplement) in 2006,[133] making it the highest ranked Spanish-speaking university in the world. The sprawling main campus of the university, known as Ciudad Universitaria, was named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2007.[134]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Metrobús rapid transit bus stop station at Mina\nMexico City has an extensive bus network, consisting of public buses, bus rapid transit, and trolleybuses.\n\n\n\n### Roads[edit]\n\n\nMexico City has a large road network, and relatively high private car usage, estimated at more than 4.5 million in 2016.[177] There is an environmental program, called Hoy No Circula (\"Today Does Not Run\", or \"One Day without a Car\"), whereby vehicles that have not passed emissions testing are restricted from circulating on certain days according to the ending digit of their license plates, in an attempt to cut down on pollution and traffic congestion.[178][179][180]\n\n\n\n### Cycling[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ecobici (Mexico City)\n\n![](image)Bicycles available for rental in Zona Rosa\nThe Mexico City local government operates North America's second-largest bicycle sharing system, Ecobici. There are, as of September 2013, 276 stations with 4,000 bicycles across an area stretching from the Historic center to Polanco.[181][182][183]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe city grew as the population did, coming up against the lake's waters. As the depth of the lake water fluctuated, Mexico City was subject to periodic flooding. A major labor draft, the *desagüe*, compelled thousands of indigenous over the colonial period to work on infrastructure to prevent flooding. Floods were not only an inconvenience but also a health hazard, since during flood periods human waste polluted the city's streets. By draining the area, the mosquito population dropped as did the frequency of the diseases they spread. However, draining the wetlands also changed the habitat for fish and birds and the areas accessible for indigenous cultivation close to the capital.[58] The 16th century saw a proliferation of churches, many of which can still be seen today in the historic center.[53]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe politics pursued by the administrations of heads of government in Mexico City at the end of the 20th century have usually been more liberal than those of the rest of the country,[144][145] whether with the support of the federal government, as was the case with the approval of several comprehensive environmental laws in the 1980s, or by laws that were since approved by the Legislative Assembly. The Legislative Assembly expanded provisions on abortions, becoming the first federal entity to expand abortion in Mexico beyond cases of rape and economic reasons, to permit it at the choice of the mother before the 12th week of pregnancy.[146] In December 2009, the then Federal District became the first city in Latin America and one of very few in the world to legalize same-sex marriage.[147]\n\n\n\n### Boroughs and neighborhoods[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Boroughs of Mexico City and Neighborhoods in Mexico City\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nVenustiano Carranza's Constitutionalist faction ultimately prevailed in the revolutionary civil war and Carranza took up residence in the presidential palace.\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera house in San Ángel designed by Juan O'Gorman\nIn the 20th century the phenomenal growth of the city and its environmental and political consequences dominate. In 1900, the population of Mexico City was about 500,000.[69] The city began to grow rapidly westward in the early part of the 20th century.[53] In the 1920s the Caracas exile community was forcefully relocated from Havana to Mexico City. As a consequence, Mexico City became the epicenter of anti-imperialism.[70]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe most recognizable icon of Mexico City is the golden Angel of Independence on the wide, elegant avenue Paseo de la Reforma, modeled by the order of the Emperor Maximilian of Mexico after the Champs-Élysées in Paris. This avenue was designed over the Americas' oldest known major roadway in the 19th century to connect the National Palace (seat of government) with the Castle of Chapultepec, the imperial residence. Today, this avenue is an important financial district in which the Mexican Stock Exchange and several corporate headquarters are located. Another important avenue is the Avenida de los Insurgentes, which extends 28.8 km (17.9 mi) and is one of the longest single avenues in the world.\n\n\nChapultepec Park houses the Chapultepec Castle, now a museum on a hill that overlooks the park and its numerous museums, monuments and the national zoo and the National Museum of Anthropology (which houses the Aztec Calendar Stone). \n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTo clean up pollution, the federal and local governments implemented numerous plans including the constant monitoring and reporting of environmental conditions, such as ozone and nitrogen oxides.[85] When the levels of these two pollutants reached critical levels, contingency actions were implemented which included closing factories, changing school hours, and extending the *A day without a car* program to two days of the week.[85] The government also instituted industrial technology improvements, a strict biannual vehicle emission inspection and the reformulation of gasoline and diesel fuels.[85] The introduction of Metrobús bus rapid transit and the Ecobici bike-sharing were among efforts to encourage alternate, greener forms of transportation.[84]\n\n\n\n### Parks and recreation[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_BbUJAAORIzlElcRoIFPsePT6","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

The growth of the city has extended beyond the limits of the city to 59 municipalities of the State of Mexico and 1 in the state of Hidalgo.[112] With a population of approximately 19.8 million inhabitants (2008),[113] it is one of the most populous conurbations in the world. Nonetheless, the annual rate of growth of the Metropolitan Area of Mexico City is much lower than that of other large urban agglomerations in Mexico,[114] a phenomenon most likely attributable to the environmental policy of decentralization.

Between 1960 and 1980 the city's population more than doubled to nearly 9 million.[53]\n\n\nIn 1980 half of all the industrial jobs in Mexico were located in Mexico City. Under relentless growth, the Mexico City government could barely keep up with services. Villagers from the countryside who continued to pour into the city to escape poverty only compounded the city's problems. With no housing available, they took over lands surrounding the city, creating huge shantytowns that extended for many miles.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The Mexico City Megalopolis as defined prior to 2019.

Some of the policies enacted included the installation of 11,000 security cameras around the city and a very large expansion of the police force. Mexico City has one of the world's highest police officer-to-resident ratios, with one uniformed officer per 100 citizens.[152] Since 1997 the prison population has increased by more than 500%.[153] Political scientist Markus-Michael Müller argues that mostly informal street vendors are hit by these measures. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n125. **^** \"Asociaciones de Inmigrantes Extranjeros en la Ciudad de México.

Many areas (e.g. Palacio Nacional and the National Institute of Cardiology) have murals painted by Diego Rivera. He and his wife Frida Kahlo lived in Coyoacán, where several of their homes, studios, and art collections are open to the public. The house where Leon Trotsky was initially granted asylum and finally murdered in 1940 is also in Coyoacán.

Landmarks in the Historic Center include the Plaza de la Constitución (Zócalo), the main central square with its epoch-contrasting Spanish-era Metropolitan Cathedral and National Palace, ancient Aztec temple ruins Templo Mayor (\"Major Temple\") and modern structures, all within a few steps of one another. (The Templo Mayor was discovered in 1978 while workers were digging to place underground electric cables).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHistorically, and since Pre-Columbian times, the Valley of Anahuac has been one of the most densely populated areas in Mexico. When the Federal District was created in 1824, the urban area of Mexico City extended approximately to the area of today's Cuauhtémoc borough. At the beginning of the 20th century, the *elites* began migrating to the south and west and soon the small towns of Mixcoac and San Ángel were incorporated by the growing conurbation. According to the 1921 census, 54.78% of the city's population was considered Mestizo (Indigenous mixed with European), 22.79% considered European, and 18.74% considered Indigenous.[111] This was the last Mexican Census which asked people to self-identify with a heritage other than Amerindian.

This valley is located in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt in the high plateaus of south-central Mexico.[77][78]\n\n\nIt has a minimum altitude of 2,200 meters (7,200 feet) above sea level and is surrounded by mountains and volcanoes that reach elevations of over 5,000 meters (16,000 feet).[79] This valley has no natural drainage outlet for the waters that flow from the mountainsides, making the city vulnerable to flooding. Drainage was engineered through the use of canals and tunnels starting in the 17th century.[77][79]\n\n\nMexico City primarily rests on what was Lake Texcoco.[77] Seismic activity is frequent there.[80] Lake Texcoco was drained starting from the 17th century. Although none of the lake waters remain, the city rests on the lake bed's heavily saturated clay. This soft base is collapsing due to the over-extraction of groundwater, called *groundwater-related subsidence*.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMexico City was traditionally known as *La Ciudad de los Palacios* (\"the City of the Palaces\"), a nickname attributed to Baron Alexander von Humboldt when visiting the city in the 19th century, who, sending a letter back to Germany, said Mexico City could rival any major city in Europe. But it was English politician Charles Latrobe who really penned the following: \"... look at their works: the moles, aqueducts, churches, roads—and the luxurious *City of Palaces* which has risen from the clay-builts ruins of Tenochtitlan...\", on page 84 of the Letter V of *The Rambler in Mexico*.[31]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Mexico City Arena\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAmong its many public and private schools (K–13), the city offers multi-cultural, multi-lingual and international schools attended by Mexican and foreign students. Best known are the Colegio Alemán (German school with three main campuses), the Liceo Mexicano Japonés (Japanese), the Centro Cultural Coreano en México (Korean), the Lycée Franco-Mexicain (French), the American School, The Westhill Institute (American School), the Edron Academy and the Greengates School (British). Mexico City joined the UNESCO Global Network of Learning Cities in 2015.[130]\n\n\nIn the Plaza de las Tres Culturas is the Colegio de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco that is recognized for being the first and oldest European school of higher learning in the Americas[131] and the first major school of interpreters and translators in the New World.[132] Other, the now-defunct Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico is considered the father of the UNAM, and it was located in the city and was the third oldest university in the Americas.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n89. **^** \"Three Kings Day in Mexico, a holiday in flux\". *LA Times Blogs – La Plaza*. 6 January 2011.

Due to the limited non-urbanized space at the south—most of which is protected through environmental laws—the contribution of Mexico City in agriculture is the smallest of all federal entities in the country.[162] The economic reforms of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari had a tremendous effect on the city, as a number of businesses, including banks and airlines, were privatized. He also signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). This led to decentralization[166] and a shift in Mexico City's economic base, from manufacturing to services, as most factories moved away to either the State of Mexico, or more commonly to the northern border. By contrast, corporate office buildings set their base in the city.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEconomically, Mexico City prospered as a result of trade. Unlike Brazil or Peru, Mexico had easy contact with both the Atlantic and Pacific worlds. Although the Spanish crown tried to completely regulate all commerce in the city, it had only partial success.[59]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSnow falls in the city very rarely, although somewhat more often in nearby mountain tops. Throughout its history, the Central Valley of Mexico was accustomed to having several snowfalls per decade (including a period between 1878 and 1895 in which every single year—except 1880—recorded snowfalls[99]) mostly lake-effect snow. The effects of the draining of Lake Texcoco and global warming have greatly reduced snowfalls after the snow flurries of 12 February 1907.[100] Since 1908, snow has only fallen three times, snow on 14 February 1920;[101] snow flurries on 14 March 1940;[102] and on 12 January 1967, when 8 centimeters (3 in) of snow fell on the city, the most on record.[103] The 1967 snowstorm coincided with the operation of *Deep Drainage System* that resulted in the total draining of what was left of Lake Texcoco.[99][104] After the disappearance of Lake Texcoco, snow has never fallen again over Mexico City.[99] The region of the Valley of Mexico receives anti-cyclonic systems. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Biblioteca Vasconcelos\nThe José Vasconcelos Library, a national library, is located on the grounds of the former Buenavista railroad station in the northern part of the city. The Papalote Museo del Niño (Kite Children's Museum), which houses the world's largest dome screen, is located in the wooded park of Chapultepec, near the Museo Tecnológico, and La Feria, a former amusement park. The theme park Six Flags México (the largest amusement park in Latin America) is located in the Ajusco neighborhood, in Tlalpan borough, southern Mexico City.

There are a multitude of venues hosting Spanish and foreign-language performers. These include the 10,000-seat National Auditorium that regularly schedules the Spanish and English-language pop and rock artists, as well as many of the world's leading performing arts ensembles, the auditorium also broadcasts grand opera performances from New York's Metropolitan Opera on giant, high definition screens. In 2007 National Auditorium was selected world's best venue by multiple genre media. Other sites for pop-artist performances include the 3,000-seat Teatro Metropolitan, the 15,000-seat Palacio de los Deportes, and the larger 50,000-seat Foro Sol Stadium, where popular international artists perform on a regular basis.

UNAM conducts 50% of Mexico's scientific research and has presence all across the country with satellite campuses, observatories and research centers. UNAM ranked 74th in the Top 200 World University Ranking published by Times Higher Education (then called Times Higher Education Supplement) in 2006,[133] making it the highest ranked Spanish-speaking university in the world.

As the depth of the lake water fluctuated, Mexico City was subject to periodic flooding. A major labor draft, the *desagüe*, compelled thousands of indigenous over the colonial period to work on infrastructure to prevent flooding. Floods were not only an inconvenience but also a health hazard, since during flood periods human waste polluted the city's streets. By draining the area, the mosquito population dropped as did the frequency of the diseases they spread. However, draining the wetlands also changed the habitat for fish and birds and the areas accessible for indigenous cultivation close to the capital.[58] The 16th century saw a proliferation of churches, many of which can still be seen today in the historic center.[53]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe politics pursued by the administrations of heads of government in Mexico City at the end of the 20th century have usually been more liberal than those of the rest of the country,[144][145] whether with the support of the federal government, as was the case with the approval of several comprehensive environmental laws in the 1980s, or by laws that were since approved by the Legislative Assembly. The Legislative Assembly expanded provisions on abortions, becoming the first federal entity to expand abortion in Mexico beyond cases of rape and economic reasons, to permit it at the choice of the mother before the 12th week of pregnancy.[146] In December 2009, the then Federal District became the first city in Latin America and one of very few in the world to legalize same-sex marriage.[147]\n\n\n\n### Boroughs and neighborhoods[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Boroughs of Mexico City and Neighborhoods in Mexico City\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nVenustiano Carranza's Constitutionalist faction ultimately prevailed in the revolutionary civil war and Carranza took up residence in the presidential palace.\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera house in San Ángel designed by Juan O'Gorman\nIn the 20th century the phenomenal growth of the city and its environmental and political consequences dominate. In 1900, the population of Mexico City was about 500,000.[69] The city began to grow rapidly westward in the early part of the 20th century.[53] In the 1920s the Caracas exile community was forcefully relocated from Havana to Mexico City. As a consequence, Mexico City became the epicenter of anti-imperialism.[70]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe most recognizable icon of Mexico City is the golden Angel of Independence on the wide, elegant avenue Paseo de la Reforma, modeled by the order of the Emperor Maximilian of Mexico after the Champs-Élysées in Paris. This avenue was designed over the Americas' oldest known major roadway in the 19th century to connect the National Palace (seat of government) with the Castle of Chapultepec, the imperial residence. Today, this avenue is an important financial district in which the Mexican Stock Exchange and several corporate headquarters are located. Another important avenue is the Avenida de los Insurgentes, which extends 28.8 km (17.9 mi) and is one of the longest single avenues in the world.\n\n\nChapultepec Park houses the Chapultepec Castle, now a museum on a hill that overlooks the park and its numerous museums, monuments and the national zoo and the National Museum of Anthropology (which houses the Aztec Calendar Stone). \n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTo clean up pollution, the federal and local governments implemented numerous plans including the constant monitoring and reporting of environmental conditions, such as ozone and nitrogen oxides.[85] When the levels of these two pollutants reached critical levels, contingency actions were implemented which included closing factories, changing school hours, and extending the *A day without a car* program to two days of the week.[85] The government also instituted industrial technology improvements, a strict biannual vehicle emission inspection and the reformulation of gasoline and diesel fuels.[85] The introduction of Metrobús bus rapid transit and the Ecobici bike-sharing were among efforts to encourage alternate, greener forms of transportation.[84]\n\n\n\n### Parks and recreation[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_BbUJAAORIzlElcRoIFPsePT6","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
