It is the sequel to *Spider-Man: Homecoming* (2017) and *Spider-Man: Far From Home* (2019), and the 27th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Jon Watts and written by Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers. It stars Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man alongside Zendaya, Benedict Cumberbatch, Jacob Batalon, Jon Favreau, Jamie Foxx, Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Benedict Wong, Tony Revolori, Marisa Tomei, Andrew Garfield, and Tobey Maguire. In the film, Parker asks Dr. Stephen Strange (Cumberbatch) to use magic to make his identity as Spider-Man a secret again following its public revelation at the end of *Far From Home*. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA third MCU Spider-Man film was planned during the production of *Homecoming* in 2017. Negotiations between Sony and Marvel Studios to alter their deal\u2014in which they produce the Spider-Man films together\u2014ended with Marvel Studios leaving the project in August 2019, but a negative fan reaction led to a new deal between the companies a month later. Watts, McKenna, Sommers, and Holland were set to return, and filming took place from October 2020 to March 2021 in New York City and Atlanta. *No Way Home* serves as a crossover between the MCU and the *Spider-Man* films directed by Sam Raimi and Marc Webb, featuring several actors reprising their roles from those films, including previous Spider-Man actors Maguire and Garfield. The involvement of both actors was the subject of wide speculation and numerous leaks despite the efforts of Sony, Marvel, and the cast to conceal their involvement.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nActors reprising their roles from earlier *Spider-Man* films include Willem Dafoe as Green Goblin, Alfred Molina as Doctor Octopus, Jamie Foxx as Electro, Thomas Haden Church as Sandman, Rhys Ifans as Lizard, and J. K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson.\n\nIn April 2021, Molina confirmed that he was appearing in the film, explaining that he had been told not to talk about his role in the film during production but he realized that his appearance had been widely rumored and reported on.[26] Later that month, J. B. Smoove revealed that he was returning as Julius Dell from *Far From Home*,[46] while Cox stated that he was not involved with the film.[115] In early May, Garfield denied that he had been asked to appear in the film, but later said \"never say never\",[116][117] while Angourie Rice was revealed to be returning as Betty Brant.[43] Later that month, Stone denied her involvement in the film.[118]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRhys Ifans reprises his role as Dr. Curt Connors / Lizard, an Oscorp scientist from Webb's *The Amazing Spider-Man* (2012) who transformed into a large reptilian monster while trying to regrow his missing arm. Thomas Haden Church reprises his role as Flint Marko / Sandman, a small-time thief from Raimi's *Spider-Man 3* who received an ability to transform into sand.[22] Both Ifans and Church returned to voice the characters, though footage at the end of the film when they revert to their human forms was archival footage from *The Amazing Spider-Man* and *Spider-Man 3*, respectively.[39] Watts served as a stand-in for Church on-set by providing motion-capture reference to the uncredited body double who physically replaced Church in the role.[40] Charlie Cox reprises his role as Matt Murdock from Marvel Television's Netflix series,[41] and Tom Hardy reprises his roles as Eddie Brock / Venom from Sony's Spider-Man Universe (SSU) in an uncredited cameo appearance in the mid-credits scene.[42]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man:  \nA teenager and Avenger who received spider-like abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider.[5] The film explores the fallout of *Spider-Man: Far From Home*'s (2019) mid-credits scene, in which Parker's identity as Spider-Man is exposed,[6] and Parker is more pessimistic in contrast to previous Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films. Holland said Parker feels defeated and insecure and was excited to explore the darker side of the character.[7] The adjustment back to portraying Parker, including raising his voice pitch and returning to the mindset of a \"na\u00efve, charming teenager\", was strange for Holland after taking on more mature roles such as in *Cherry* (2021).[8]\n* Zendaya as Michelle \"MJ\" Jones-Watson:  \nParker's classmate and girlfriend.[9][10][11] The character's full name is revealed in the film, having previously just been known as Michelle Jones, bringing her closer to the comics counterpart Mary Jane Watson.[10]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBy December 2020, Alfred Molina was set to reprise his role as Otto Octavius / Doctor Octopus from Sam Raimi's *Spider-Man 2* (2004),[25] with Tobey Maguire reprising his role as Peter Parker / Spider-Man from Raimi's *Spider-Man* film trilogy and Andrew Garfield returning as Peter Parker / Spider-Man from Webb's *The Amazing Spider-Man* films.[31] A cameo appearance of Maguire and Garfield alongside Holland as their respective Spider-Men had previously been considered for the Sony Pictures Animation film *Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse* (2018), but was cut then because Sony felt at that moment that it would be too risky and confusing.[99] At that time, *Collider* reported that Maguire and Garfield would appear in the film alongside Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson from Raimi's *Spider-Man* film trilogy and Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy from the *Amazing Spider-Man* films.[100] The first draft of the script included other characters from the *Spider-Man* and *Amazing Spider-Man* films, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFans will be in heaven\".[236] Peter Debruge of *Variety* praised Garfield's and Maguire's performances and felt the film \"provides enough resolution for the past two decades of Spider-Man adventures that audiences who've tuned out along the way will be rewarded for giving this one a shot\".[33] Writing for *Den of Geek*, Don Kaye gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, for its action sequences, performances and chemistry of the cast, stating that \"*No Way Home* channels the entire spectrum of Spider-Man movies while setting the character on a course all his own at last\".[237] Jennifer Bisset of *CNET* praised the action sequences, performances, and story, writing: \"A Russo Brothers influence can almost be felt ushering Holland's third Spider-Man movie into new, weightier territory. If the character is to become the next Tony Stark, this is the way to etch a few more scars into a more interesting hero's facade. If you came for the biggest movie of the year, you'll definitely leave satisfied\".[238]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Lead actor Tom Holland and director Jon Watts in 2016\nDuring production on *Spider-Man: Homecoming* (2017), two sequels were being planned by Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures.[53] In June 2017, star Tom Holland explained that each film would take place during a different year of high school for Peter Parker / Spider-Man, with the third being set during the character's senior year.[54] Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige noted in July 2019 that the third film would feature \"a Peter Parker story that has never been done before on film\" due to the ending of the second film, *Spider-Man: Far From Home* (2019), which publicly reveals that Parker is Spider-Man.[55]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n2021 Marvel Studios film\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Spider-Man: No Way Home |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Theatrical release poster\n |\n| Directed by | Jon Watts |\n| Based on | Spider-Manby * Stan Lee\n* Steve Ditko\n |\n| Produced by | * Kevin Feige\n* Amy Pascal\n |\n| Starring | * Tom Holland\n* Zendaya\n* Benedict Cumberbatch\n* Jacob Batalon\n* Jon Favreau\n* Jamie Foxx\n* Willem Dafoe\n* Alfred Molina\n* Benedict Wong\n* Tony Revolori\n* Marisa Tomei\n* Andrew Garfield\n* Tobey Maguire\n |\n| Cinematography | Mauro Fiore |\n| Edited by | * Jeffrey Ford\n* Leigh Folsom Boyd\n |\n| Music by | Michael Giacchino |\n| Productioncompanies\n | * Columbia Pictures\n* Marvel Studios\n* Pascal Pictures\n |\n| Distributed by | Sony Pictures Releasing |\n| Release dates\n | * December\u00a013,\u00a02021\u00a0(2021-12-13) (Fox Village Theatre)\n* December\u00a017,\u00a02021\u00a0(2021-12-17) (United States)\n |\n| Running time\n | 148 minutes[1] |\n| Country | United States |\n| Language | English |\n| Budget | $200\u00a0million[2] |\n| Box office | $1.922\u00a0billion[3][4] |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n60. **^** Thorne, Will (September 5, 2019). \"Sony Pictures Chief on Spider-Man Split: 'For the Moment the Door is Closed'\". *Variety*.

The film received positive reviews from critics and grossed over $1.9 billion worldwide, surpassing its predecessor as the highest-grossing film released by Sony Pictures. It became the highest-grossing film of 2021, the sixth-highest-grossing film of all time, the highest grossing Spider-Man film, and set several other box office records, including those for films released during the COVID-19 pandemic. The film received a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the 94th Academy Awards, among numerous other accolades. An extended version of the film, subtitled *The More Fun Stuff Version*, had a global theatrical release in September 2022. A sequel is in development.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 93%, with an average score of 7.9/10, based on 430 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads: \"A bigger, bolder *Spider-Man* sequel, *No Way Home* expands the franchise's scope and stakes without losing sight of its humor and heart.\"[233] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 71 out of 100, based on 60 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[234] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare \"A+\" grade on an A+ to F scale, the first live-action Spider-Man film and the fourth MCU film overall to earn the score after *The Avengers* (2012), *Black Panther* (2018), and *Avengers: Endgame*.[213] PostTrak reported 96% of audience members gave it a positive score, with 91% saying they would definitely recommend it.[213]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJeffrey Ford and Leigh Folsom Boyd served as the film's editors.[137] The visual effects were provided by Cinesite, Clear Angle Studios, Crafty Apes, Digital Domain, Folks VFX, Framestore, Luma Pictures, Monsters Aliens Robots Zombies, Mr. X, Perception, Secret Lab, Sony Pictures Imageworks, and SSVFX.[138]\n\n\n\n## Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Spider-Man: No Way Home* (soundtrack)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nVary of *Variety* noted that these reports were not confirmed and questioned whether the returning actors would be making more than cameo appearances.[104] Shortly after, Holland denied that Maguire and Garfield would appear in the film.[86] Many of the actors returning from previous *Spider-Man* films were brought to set in cloaks in order to help prevent their involvements in the film from leaking.[105] Around Christmas 2020, McKenna and Sommers rewrote the introductions of Maguire and Garfield as well as much of the third act in time for those actors to start filming. They had not been able to focus on those scenes earlier because they were busy during filming of much of the first and second acts in the previous months.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n262. **^** Barnes, Brooks (December 17, 2021). \"Kevin Feige and Amy Pascal on the Future of 'Spider-Man' and the M.C.U.\" *The New York Times*.

The existing deal had Marvel and Feige produce the Spider-Man films for Sony and receive 5% of their revenue. Sony wanted to expand the deal to include more films while keeping the same terms of the original agreement. Disney expressed concern with Feige's workload producing the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) franchise already and asked for a 25\u201350% stake in any future films Feige produced for Sony.[56][59][58] Unable to come to an agreement, Sony announced that it would be moving forward on the next Spider-Man film without Feige or Marvel's involvement. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Films | * *Spider-Man* (2002)\n* *Spider-Man 2* (2004)\n* *Spider-Man 3* (2007)\n* Accolades\n |\n| Characters | * Peter Parker\n* Mary Jane Watson\n* Harry Osborn\n* Norman Osborn\n* Otto Octavius\n* J.

Molina was surprised by this approach because he had aged in the years since he made that film; digital de-aging was also used to make him look physically the same as in *Spider-Man 2*.[26] The mechanical tentacles were created completely through CGI, rather than blending them with puppetry as in *Spider-Man 2*.[27][24]\n* Benedict Wong as Wong: Strange's mentor and friend who became the new Sorcerer Supreme during Strange's absence in the Blip.[28][19]\n* Tony Revolori as Eugene \"Flash\" Thompson: Parker's classmate and former rival.[29]\n* Marisa Tomei as May Parker:  \n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTwo weeks later, Peter visits MJ to reintroduce himself to her and Ned, but he decides against it.

He expressed interest in a film focusing on the Miles Morales version of Spider-Man instead. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Fan films | * *Spider-Man* (1969)\n* *Spider-Man Versus Kraven the Hunter* (1974)\n* *Viva Spider-Man* (1989)\n* *The Green Goblin's Last Stand* (1992)\n* *Spider-Man Lives: A Miles Morales Story* (2015)\n* *Spider-Man: Lotus* (2023)\n |\n| Unofficial films | * *3 Dev Adam* (1973)\n* *SpiderBabe* (2003)\n* *Spider-Plant Man* (2005)\n* *Italian Spiderman* (2007)\n |\n| Related | * *Spider-Man: The New Animated Series*\n* Lego Spider-Man\n* *Spider-Man* pinball\n* List of Spider-Man film cast members\n |\n| * ![](image) Category\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMarvel Cinematic Universe\n |\n| --- |\n| * List of feature films\n\t+ accolades\n* List of television series\n\t+ accolades\n* Television specials\n* Timeline\n |\n| \n\n| Marvel Studios\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Infinity Saga | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nwe're pretty capable of doing what we have to do here.\"[60] However, after this fan reaction continued at Disney's biennial convention D23, and at the urging of Holland who personally spoke to Disney CEO Bob Iger and Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group chairman Tom Rothman,[61] the companies returned to negotiations.[62] Sony and Disney announced a new agreement at the end of September which would allow Marvel Studios and Feige to produce another MCU Spider-Man film for Sony with Amy Pascal, scheduled for July 16, 2021.[5] Disney was reportedly co-financing 25% of the film in exchange for 25% of its profits, while retaining the character's merchandising rights.[5][62] Feige said he was \"thrilled\" that the character would remain in the MCU and said \"all of us at Marvel Studios are very excited that we get to keep working\" on the franchise. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Music | * *The Amazing Spider-Man*\n* *The Amazing Spider-Man 2*\n* *Music from and Inspired by Spider-Man*\n* *Spider-Man: Original Motion Picture Score*\n* *Spider-Man 2*\n* *Spider-Man 3*\n* *Spider-Man: Homecoming*\n* *Spider-Man: Far From Home*\n* *Spider-Man: No Way Home*\n* *Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse*\n* *Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse*\n |\n| Theme park attractions | * *The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man*\n* *Meet Spider-Man and the Marvel Super Heroes*\n* *Web Slingers: A Spider-Man Adventure*\n |\n| Related articles | * Spider-Man enemies in other media\n\t+ Green Goblin\n* Spider-Man films cast members\n |\n| * **![](image) Category**\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nSony's Spider-Man Universe\n |\n| --- |\n| Films | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * *Venom* (2018)\n* *Venom: Let There Be Carnage* (2021)\n* *Morbius* (2022)\n* *Madame Web* (2024)\n* *Venom: The Last Dance* (2024)\n* *Kraven the Hunter* (2024)\n |\n| Canceled | * *Silver & Black*\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nJonah Jameson, the host of *The Daily Bugle*;[47][48] and Gary Weeks as Department of Damage Control (DODC) agent Foster.[49] Jake Gyllenhaal appears as Quentin Beck / Mysterio via archive footage from *Far From Home*.[50] Also appearing in the film are Paula Newsome as an MIT administrator,[45] Arian Moayed as DODC agent Cleary,[50] Mary Rivera as Ned's grandmother,[45] and Cristo Fern\u00e1ndez as a bartender serving Brock.[42] Tom Holland's brother Harry Holland was set to make a cameo as a thief, but his scenes were cut from the original theatrical release.[51] Lexi Rabe, who portrayed Stark's daughter Morgan in *Avengers: Endgame* (2019), also had an appearance that was not included in the theatrical release.[52]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nabout our experiences with the character\".[37] Parker ends up saving MJ during the climax in a similar way to how he fails to save Stacy in *The Amazing Spider-Man 2*;

Batalon and Zendaya note that Holland could not be trusted with the actual title since he had \"accidentally\" revealed the second film's title. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nShe was hopeful that May's work as a community organizer would be featured in the film.[30] Also in June, Charlie Cox, who portrayed Matt Murdock / Daredevil in Marvel Television's Netflix series, was contacted by Feige about reprising his role in upcoming Marvel Studios projects starting with appearances in *No Way Home* and the Disney+ series *She-Hulk: Attorney at Law*.[73][74] The next month, Holland said production was planned to take place from late 2020 to February 2021,[75] and Sony shifted the film's release date to December 17, 2021.[76] Tony Revolori was also confirmed to be reprising his role as Flash Thompson.[29] In early October, Jacob Batalon and Benedict Cumberbatch were set to reprise their MCU roles of Ned Leeds and Strange, while Jamie Foxx was set to return as Max Dillon / Electro from Marc Webb's *The Amazing Spider-Man 2* (2014), with filming beginning later in the month.[17][12] Immediately prior to the beginning of filming, several other key actors in the film had yet to sign on. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*CNN*'s Brian Lowry praised the humor and wrote, \"What's already apparent, though, is that this movie was conceived to be savored and enjoyed.

It is the sequel to *Spider-Man: Homecoming* (2017) and the 23rd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Jon Watts, written by Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers, and stars Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, alongside Samuel L. Jackson, Zendaya, Cobie Smulders, Jon Favreau, J. B. Smoove, Jacob Batalon, Martin Starr, Tony Revolori, Marisa Tomei, and Jake Gyllenhaal. In the film, Parker is recruited by Nick Fury (Jackson) and Mysterio (Gyllenhaal) to face the Elementals while he is on a school trip to Europe.\n\n\nDiscussions for a sequel to *Spider-Man: Homecoming* began by October 2016, and the project was confirmed later that year. Holland, Watts, and the writers were all set to return by the end of 2017. In 2018, Jackson and Gyllenhaal joined the cast as Fury and Mysterio, respectively. Holland revealed the sequel's title ahead of filming, which began that July and took place in England, the Czech Republic, Italy, and the New York metropolitan area. Production wrapped in October 2018. The marketing campaign is one of the most expensive for a film ever and attempted to avoid revealing spoilers for *Avengers: Endgame* prior to its April 2019 release.\n\n\n*Spider-Man: Far From Home* premiered at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on June 26, 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on July 2, as the final film in Phase Three of the MCU. The film received positive reviews with praise for its humor, action sequences, visuals, and the performances of Holland and Gyllenhaal. It grossed over $1.1 billion worldwide, making it the first Spider-Man film to pass the billion-dollar mark, the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2019, and became Sony Pictures' highest-grossing film and the 24th-highest-grossing film of all time. A sequel, *Spider-Man: No Way Home*, was released in December 2021.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn Ixtenco, Mexico, Nick Fury and Maria Hill investigate an unnatural storm and encounter the Earth Elemental. Quentin Beck, a super-powered individual, arrives to defeat the creature, and is subsequently recruited by Fury and Hill. In New York City, the Midtown School of Science and Technology completes its year, which was restarted to accommodate the students who previously disintegrated five years earlier as a result of Thanos' actions.[a] They had reappeared un-aged, thanks to the actions of the Avengers.[b] The school organizes a two-week summer field trip to Europe, where Peter Parker\u2014who is still mourning the death of his mentor Tony Stark\u2014plans to reveal to classmate MJ his attraction to her. Happy Hogan informs Parker that Fury intends to contact him, but Parker ignores Fury's phone call.\n\n\nParker and his classmates travel to Venice, Italy, where the Water Elemental attacks. Parker helps protect his classmates, while Beck arrives and defeats the creature. Fury meets with Parker and gives him Stark's glasses, which were meant for his successor. The glasses enable him to communicate with and take command of the artificial intelligence E.D.I.T.H., which has access to Stark Industries' databases and commands a large orbital weapons supply. Beck claims to have entered from an alternate reality within the multiverse, where the four Elementals killed his family and destroyed his civilization. With only the Fire Elemental left to destroy, Beck predicts it will attack Prague. Parker declines Fury's invitation to join the fight and returns to his class trip.\n\n\nFury secretly changes the class's itinerary to divert the students to Prague. There, Parker is forced to help Beck fight the Fire Elemental to again protect his friends. Beck manages to destroy the creature with Parker's help. Fury and Hill invite Parker and Beck to Berlin to discuss the formation of a new superhero team, but Parker decides that Beck should go alone and transfers control of E.D.I.T.H. to him. Once Parker leaves, Beck celebrates alongside ex-Stark Industries employees, with whom he had been working to masquerade as a superhero. Beck, who was fired from his position as Stark's holographic-illusions specialist for his unstable nature, used advanced projectors to simulate his powers and the Elementals, and now hopes to use E.D.I.T.H.'s orbital weaponized drones to increase the scale of his illusions and fraudulently establish himself as an Avenger-level hero.\n\n\nAfter MJ tells Parker she knows he is Spider-Man, they discover that a piece of debris she retrieved during the battle with the Fire Elemental is a projector which shows the Air Elemental, leading them to realize Beck's deception. Parker travels to Berlin to warn Fury, only to be tricked by Beck with an illusory Fury into revealing the names of his friends who know about Beck's plan and is hit by a train. Left for dead by Beck, Parker contacts Hogan, who flies him to London, where his classmates are. Beck uses E.D.I.T.H. to orchestrate a fusion of all the Elementals, as a cover to kill Parker's friends. Parker is able to disrupt the illusions, so Beck attacks him with drones. Parker regains control of E.D.I.T.H. and defeats Beck, who is hit by a misfired gunshot from one of the drones; before he dies, Beck tells one of his associates to retrieve data from the drones. After returning to New York City, Parker begins a relationship with MJ.\n\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, J. Jonah Jameson of *TheDailyBugle.net* broadcasts doctored footage of the London incident in which Beck frames Spider-Man for the drone attack and his death before exposing Spider-Man's secret identity to the world, much to Parker's shock. In a post-credits scene, Fury and Hill are revealed to be the Skrulls Talos and Soren in disguise, under orders from the real Fury while he is away in space commanding a group of Skrulls.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n* Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man:   \nA high-school junior and Avenger who received spider-like abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider.[3] Director Jon Watts said that, in contrast to *Spider-Man: Homecoming* in which Parker longs for the responsibilities of an adult, in *Far From Home* he wants to hang onto his youth, saying, \"This film is about the world telling him, 'It's time for you to step up and grow up, kid,' and he's saying, 'But I still want to be a kid and go on vacation.'\"[4]\n* Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury:   \nThe former director of S.H.I.E.L.D.,[5] who is now in a situation where he does not have the level of control he is used to having.[6] Watts describes Fury's relationship with Parker as \"the mean new stepdad\", contrasting his role with Tony Stark as a \"supportive cool uncle\" in *Homecoming*, saying, \"Fury sees Peter Parker as an asset that he needs who is too preoccupied with a bunch of high school problems.\" Watts originally pitched Fury as a mentor to Parker in *Homecoming*.[7]\n* Zendaya as Michelle \"MJ\" Jones-Watson: Parker's classmate and love interest.[8][9] Her full name, Michelle Jones-Watson, is revealed in the sequel *Spider-Man: No Way Home* (2021).[8]\n* Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill: A former high-ranking S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who works closely with Nick Fury.[5]\n* Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan:   \nThe head of security for Stark Industries and former driver and bodyguard of Tony Stark who looks after Parker.[10] Watts noted Happy would be used to explore the idea of \"trying to find your place in the world if the center of your world is gone\" given his close friendship to Stark.[11]\n* J. B. Smoove as Julius Dell:   \nParker's teacher and a chaperone on his school trip to Europe. The role was written for Smoove after the writers and director enjoyed his performance alongside Holland in an Audi commercial short film produced to promote *Homecoming*.[12][13]\n* Jacob Batalon as Ned Leeds: Parker's best friend.[14][15] His last name is confirmed on-screen in *No Way Home*.[8]\n* Martin Starr as Roger Harrington: Parker's academic decathlon teacher and a chaperone on his school trip to Europe.[16][12]\n* Tony Revolori as Eugene \"Flash\" Thompson: Parker's rival.[17]\n* Marisa Tomei as May Parker: Parker's aunt who is aware of his secret identity and wants him to be Spider-Man more so he can help with charitable causes.[18][19][12]\n* Jake Gyllenhaal as Quentin Beck / Mysterio:   \nA former Stark Industries employee and holographic-illusions specialist who masquerades as a superhero from Earth-833 in the multiverse. He is recruited by Nick Fury to help Spider-Man stop the Elementals.[20][11][21] Gyllenhaal shared ideas with the writers regarding the character's personality, and was drawn to the idea that Beck is \"manipulating everyone's love of superheroes and that need for heroes\". Gyllenhaal wanted to play the character's fake backstory as realistically as possible.[22] Regarding Beck's relationship with Parker, Watts says that \"If Tony Stark was sort of the mentor in the previous films, we thought it would be interesting to play Mysterio as almost like the cool uncle.\"[4] Watts was excited to have Beck team with Fury and Parker as it introduced the character to the MCU \"in a way that people weren't expecting.\"[6]\n\n\nAngourie Rice and Jorge Lendeborg Jr. reprise their roles from *Homecoming* as Parker's classmates Betty Brant, Ned's on-and-off girlfriend,[12][23] and Jason Ionello.[24] Peter Billingsley reprises his *Iron Man* (2008) role of scientist William Ginter Riva, a former employee of Stark Industries who now works with Beck.[25] J. K. Simmons appears as J. Jonah Jameson in the mid-credits scene,[26] marking the first time an actor has reprised a non-MCU role in an MCU film after Simmons portrayed a different incarnation of Jameson in Sam Raimi's *Spider-Man* film trilogy.[27] Ben Mendelsohn and Sharon Blynn make uncredited cameo appearances in the post-credits scene as the Skrulls Talos and Soren, reprising their roles from *Captain Marvel* (2019);[26] this scene reveals that they have been posing as Fury and Hill during the film, with deleted footage of Jackson and Smulders, originally intended for the opening scene, used in the reveal. Smulders learned about the twist from producer Kevin Feige shortly before the film's release.[28]\n\n\nAdditionally, Numan Acar portrays Fury's associate Dimitri,[29][30] while Remy Hii plays Brad Davis, a popular student whom Parker sees as competition for MJ's affection,[31][32] and Claire Rushbrook portrays Janice Lincoln, a woman working for Beck.[33] Zach Barack, the first openly transgender actor in an MCU film, portrays one of Parker's new classmates, Zach,[34][35][36] while Zoha Rahman also appears as a classmate of Parker's.[37] Dawn Michelle King, an assistant editor on many MCU films including *Far From Home*, provides the voice for the artificial intelligence E.D.I.T.H.[38] Jeff Bridges and Robert Downey Jr. appear as Obadiah Stane and Stark through the use of archival footage from *Iron Man* and *Captain America: Civil War* (2016), respectively.[25][39] Images from previous MCU films of Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, and Paul Bettany as Stark, Steve Rogers / Captain America, Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow, and Vision, respectively, are used in the film's opening \"in memoriam\" segment.[40][41]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Actor Tom Holland (L) and director Jon Watts (R) were signed to return for the sequel early in development.\nIn June 2016, Sony Pictures chairman Tom Rothman stated that Sony and Marvel Studios were committed to making future *Spider-Man* films after *Spider-Man: Homecoming* (2017).[42] The following month, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige said if additional films were made, the company had an early idea to follow the model of the *Harry Potter* film series, and have the plot of each film cover a new school year,[43] with a second film intended to take place during Parker's junior year of high school.[44] By October, discussions had begun for a second film, including which villain would be featured, according to Spider-Man actor Tom Holland, who was signed for two more *Spider-Man* films after *Homecoming*.[45][46] In December, after the successful release of the first *Homecoming* trailer, Sony slated a sequel to the film for July 5, 2019.[47] Sony's insistence that the sequel be released in 2019 complicated Marvel's preference for secrecy regarding their plans for Spider-Man in this film and their other MCU films, since the character would die at the end of *Avengers: Infinity War* (2018), and would not be resurrected before *Avengers: Endgame* in April 2019 by which time marketing for this film would have already begun.[48]\n\n\nAfter being able to include Iron Man for *Homecoming*, Sony was revealed in June 2017 to have the use of another Marvel Studios-controlled character for the sequel.[49] Feige stated that Marvel and Sony were \"just starting to solidify our plans\" for the film, and felt Spider-Man's appearances in *Avengers: Infinity War* and *Avengers: Endgame* would \"launch him off into a very new cinematic universe at that point\", similar to how *Captain America: Civil War* (2016) \"informed everything in *Homecoming*\".[50] Marvel and Sony both wanted *Homecoming* director Jon Watts returning for the sequel, with Feige saying \"that's the intention for sure\", and Watts said he was signed for another Spider-Man film.[51] Feige said the sequel would have a subtitle like *Homecoming*, and would not feature \"2\" in the title. He added that filming was expected to begin in April or May 2018.[52] As with *Homecoming*, Feige said the film's villain would be one that had not yet been seen in film.[53] By July, Watts was in negotiations with the studios regarding his return for the sequel,[3] and Marisa Tomei expressed interest in returning as Aunt May from the previous films.[54]\n\n\nThe film is set eight months after the conclusion of *Avengers: Endgame*.[55] Watts felt dealing with many of the unanswered questions from *Endgame* posed \"a fun creative challenge\" for the *Far From Home* team. They looked to \"make a movie that's in that world and deals with those stories but is also still [a] fun Spider-Man movie\". For example, Ned, MJ, and Flash all turned to dust during the events of *Infinity War* along with Parker, while some of his classmates did not and are now five years older due to the events of *Endgame*. Watts compared this dynamic to the film *Flight of the Navigator* (1986), calling the situation \"really weird\u00a0... but\u00a0... also something you can have a lot of fun with\".[6]\n\n\n\n### Pre-production[edit]\n\n\nAt the end of August 2017, as the film was entering pre-production,[52] Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers were in final negotiations to return from *Homecoming* to write the sequel.[56] In early October, Jacob Batalon confirmed he would reprise his role of Ned in the sequel.[14] Feige confirmed that Watts was returning to direct the sequel in December.[57] By February 2018, Zendaya was slated to return for the film, reprising her role as MJ.[58] Location scouting for the film began at the end of the month, as did the pre-visualisation process for the creative team to begin planning action sequences and visual effects for the film.[59] By late April, Feige stated that filming was scheduled to begin in early July 2018, and would primarily occur in London. This was a change from the first film, which was mostly produced in Atlanta. Feige explained that one of the reasons behind this change in location was because a majority of the sequel would be spent around the world, outside New York City.[60]\n\n\nA month later, Jake Gyllenhaal entered negotiations to play Mysterio, while Tomei and Michael Keaton were confirmed to reprise their respective roles of May and Adrian Toomes / Vulture; Gyllenhaal's casting was confirmed a month later,[61] but Watts later stated that Keaton and Laura Harrier would not be appearing in the sequel.[11] Also in May, McKenna and Sommers were also confirmed as the film's screenwriters.[18][62] They began working on the film from a set of notes that Marvel had put together based on different influences and story ideas. This included the directive that the film would be releasing shortly after *Endgame* and would need to deal with the death of Stark due to the relationship between that character and Spider-Man that previous films had established. The film also needed to deal with the aftereffects of \"the Blip\", the five-year period between *Infinity War* and *Endgame* where half of all life disappeared. Mysterio was chosen to be the film's villain because he is one of Spider-Man's iconic villains that had yet to be featured in a film, and because his history of deception in the comics lent itself to a character who could take advantage of a Spider-Man that is mourning the death of Stark. This also allowed the writers to explore relevant modern themes such as fake news. Mysterio's plan went through several iterations, including an early suggestion that he could be an alien Skrull in disguise.[63]\n\n\nThe film reuses two of Spider-Man's costumes from the previous films: his main costume from *Captain America: Civil War* and *Spider-Man: Homecoming*, and the Iron Spider suit from *Avengers: Infinity War* and *Avengers: Endgame*. It also introduces two new costumes: a black \"stealth\" costume given to Parker by Nick Fury, and a new, upgraded Spider-Man suit that Parker designs for himself at the end of the film.[64] Marvel Studios' head of visual development Ryan Meinerding explained that Watts had wanted to include a suit inspired by the Spider-Man Noir version of the character, which led to the design of the more tactical stealth suit. He added that the suit represents Parker experimenting with being a new kind of superhero. Other tactical costumes from the comic books were looked at when developing this one, but Meinerding felt they looked less practical than the more straightforward Noir inspiration. The costume includes tactical goggles that can be flipped up. For Parker's new self-designed costume, Meinerding originally designed it with the idea that it would be made from Parker's webbing since that is the strongest material he has access to.[65] Practical versions of the costumes were created by Ironhead Studio, who previously worked on *The Amazing Spider-Man* films. For *Far From Home*, Ironhead developed a skull cap for the costumes that has built-in fans to prevent the goggles from steaming up. They also developed a magnetic bellows system for connecting the goggles to the mask, so they could be easily removed but not fall off during action sequences.[66]\n\n\nAt the end of June 2018, Holland revealed the film's title to be *Spider-Man: Far From Home*.[67] Feige explained that they decided to have Holland reveal the title because they thought it was likely that it would leak after filming began anyway.[68] He compared the title to *Spider-Man: Homecoming* in that it is \"full of alternate meaning\" while continuing the use of \"Home\",[69] and revealed the film's premise to be Parker and his friends going to Europe on summer vacation, away from their home of New York.[70]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The set of the film in Venice, Italy\nPrincipal photography began on location in Hertfordshire, England, on July 2, 2018,[71] under the working title *Fall of George*.[72] Matthew J. Lloyd served as director of photography, after previously working with Watts on *Cop Car* (2015). Watts had wanted to work with Lloyd on *Homecoming*, but the cinematographer was working on *Power Rangers* (2017) at the time.[73] Filming moved to London,[60] with locations including East London,[74] and at London Stansted Airport.[75] Studio work occurred at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden near Watford, England, where a Venice set was created on one of the studio's backlots.[12][32] Shortly after filming began, set photos revealed Hemky Madera would return as bodega owner Mr. Delmar,[76] while J.B. Smoove and Numan Acar joined the cast.[77][29]\n\n\nBy early August, Samuel L. Jackson and Cobie Smulders were confirmed to be appearing in the film, reprising their respective roles of Nick Fury and Maria Hill from previous MCU films,[5] and Remy Hii joined the cast later in the month.[31] Filming took place in Prague and Liberec in the Czech Republic in September,[78][79] and moved to Venice by the end of the month.[79] Filming moved to New York City and Newark, New Jersey in October, where it used the working title *Bosco*.[80][81] Locations included areas around Madison Square Garden and Penn Station,[81] and Newark Liberty International Airport.[75] Filming wrapped on October 16, 2018.[82]\n\n\nLloyd explained that the creative team had approached the film as a road-trip story, and so he wanted to maintain the distinct look and feel of each location visited. This meant giving each stop on the school trip a distinct lighting scheme and color palette. For example, Lloyd visited Venice three times during location scouting to discuss how the scenes there would be filmed, and learned that the city has a \"bright, pastel feel, where the light comes through and hits a building. It bathes people in this warm, sandy light\". Prague, on other hand, has a \"more warm and cool mix, and the beauty of that sort of Baroque, eastern-European architecture.\" The production took advantage of lighting already on the buildings in Prague, which are often lit for texture in real life. Lloyd felt comfortable working within the aesthetic of the MCU after acting as director of photography on the first season of the MCU television series *Daredevil* and the miniseries *The Defenders*, as well as working on additional photography for the films *Thor: Ragnarok* (2017) and *Captain Marvel* (2019).[73] Lloyd originally began planning to use the Alexa 65 cameras that Marvel usually films with, but Sony asked that they focus on optimizing the footage for their 2K releases, so the production switched to Alexa Mini cameras. This ended up being a lot easier for the camera department to use on location, and for combining live-action shooting with visual effects elements.[59]\n\n\n\n### Post-production[edit]\n\n\nIn late October 2018, Sony Pictures reached a new multi-film agreement with IMAX Corporation to release their films in IMAX, including *Far From Home*.[83] At Sony's CCXP Brazil panel in December 2018, it was revealed that the Elementals\u2014a group of characters based on the elements of water, earth, air, and fire\u2014would appear in the film.[84] The four Elementals are modeled after different Spider-Man villains from Marvel comic books: the water Elemental borrows from Hydro-Man, the fire Elemental borrows from Molten Man, the Earth Elemental borrows from Sandman, and the air Elemental borrows from Cyclone.[85][86][87][88] The names of these other villains are not given to the characters in the film.[12][32] Martin Starr was confirmed to be reprising his role as Mr. Harrington from *Homecoming* the next month.[89][16] In April 2019, Sony moved the film's release date up to July 2, 2019.[90] While promoting *Endgame* at a fan event in Shanghai, Feige said *Far From Home* would be the final film of the MCU's Phase Three, rather than the start of Phase Four as some had believed.[91] Also in April, Jackson returned to do reshoots for the film.[92]\n\n\nDiscussing the film's mid-credits scene, Watts explained that they approached J.K. Simmons \"as late as possible\" before the film's release to ask him to reprise his role as J. Jonah Jameson from Sam Raimi's *Spider-Man* film trilogy, hoping to keep the cameo a surprise for fans.[93] Watts acknowledged that there was a chance Simmons would not want to reprise the role, but stated that he never considered another actor, saying, \"It's gotta be him. Like, if it wasn't him, it wasn't worth doing.\"[94] After being pitched the idea for the cameo, Simmons called Raimi and received the director's blessing to return to the role for the new film.[95] The MCU version of the character is brand new, not the Raimi version \"from another dimension or multiverse\".[96] Simmons' footage was filmed in a Disney conference room in front of a green screen.[93] Watts noted that Simmons' performance was over-the-top in Raimi's films, but now that same performance has real-world comparisons,[94] such as Alex Jones. According to Feige, the changes in the real world also meant that moving the character from a newspaper editor to a \"radical right news journalist that kind of scream[s] in front of the camera\" made more sense.[96] Simmons said he and Watts did not see \"eye to eye\" on the film's contemporary portrayal of the character versus his performance in Raimi's films.[97]\n\n\nWatts described *Far From Home* as a \"con man movie\" with \"so many layers of deception\", and for the post-credits scene he felt that ending the film with \"one last twist\" was on theme. He felt that he owed the fans a more substantial post-credits scene than the jokey one at the end of *Homecoming*. The *Far From Home* scene depicts Fury on vacation, in a simulation, both of which are also themes in the film, and reveals that the Fury and Hill seen throughout the film are actually Skrulls in disguise. Watts felt this twist made sense after Fury's interactions with the Skrulls in *Captain Marvel*.[94] Post-production for *Spider-Man: Far From Home* was completed in June 2019.[98]\n\n\n\n#### Visual effects[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| External videos |\n| --- |\n| ![video icon](image) Marvel Studios' Spider-Man: Far From Home - End Credits Main on End Title Sequence presents the film's main-on-end title sequence, YouTube video from Perception's channel |\n\n\nThe film's visual effects were provided by Framestore, Industrial Light & Magic, Image Engine, Sony Pictures Imageworks, Luma Pictures, Rising Sun Pictures, Scanline VFX, Territory Studio, and Method Studios.[99] Janek Sirrs served as visual effects supervisor on the film, and explained that following the release of the animated film *Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse* (2018) the effects team looked for ways to use similarly inventive visuals in *Far From Home*. They ultimately did not use added effects to represent Spider-Man's Spider-sense because these did not fit within the live-action world or were too similar to previous effects, such as Daredevil's sonar vision. They did try to use Spider-Man's actions and the use of his abilities to show his growth since *Homecoming*, but to also show his \"reach as always exceeding his grasp as he refines his superhero skills\".[100] The film's main-on-end title sequence was designed by Perception.[101]\n\n\nMethod Studios added Spider-Man to a Venice speedboat scene, using their Spider-Man suit asset from *Homecoming*.[102] Image Engine created the Stark jet, drone, and satellite. The jet work included the creation of a new Spider-Man suit,[102] for which the vendor had to design the interior of the suit based on a scan of a practical costume they were given. They also made a Netherlands tulip field for a scene that was filmed in a grass field in the UK. It required around two million digital tulips.[103] Rising Sun Pictures created the holograms used by Mysterio when he first explains the Elementals to Spider-Man, which include simulations of black-holes and elements researched from real-world history and mythology. The company aimed for the holograms to have a similar quality to the ones that they had created for *Captain Marvel*.[102] Mysterio was designed by Ryan Meinerding, Marvel Studios' head of visual development, to look like a combination of different Marvel heroes such as Thor and Doctor Strange. His fishbowl helmet is retained from the comics. Sirrs described the character as a \"larger-than-life showman at heart\" and almost a superhero version of Liberace.[100] The digital model for Mysterio was created by Scanline.[104]\n\n\nThe Elementals consisted of animated figures, often driven by slowed-down motion-capture performances, with environmental effects layered on top. Scanline created Earth and Water, Luma created Fire, and Imageworks created the final amalgamation of the four creatures,[100] referred to as the Super Uber Elemental (SUE).[104] For the Fire Elemental, Luma created different looks and actions for the character to show Watts and Sirrs potential designs and movements for the character. This included a progression where the creature goes from being upright and humanoid to bigger and more hunched over as it consumes metal throughout the sequence. Watts responded positively to movements that looked more creature-like.[105] The final battle was created by Imageworks, and consists of over 300 visual effects shots. In addition to creating the SUE\u2014which required extensive effect simulations for the different combined elements such as \"water tentacles\", rocks, lava, and lightning\u2014the company had to create a digital model of the Tower Bridge for the fight to take place around. The company attempted to fully render only small sections of the bridge where needed, but ultimately required around 80% of the bridge to be fully detailed due to how much of it is seen throughout the fight. They made use of Image Engine's Stark jet model and Scanline's Mysterio asset for the fight, and created the drone models and new Spider-Man suit that were used by the other vendors. They started with a single drone design that featured missiles, cannons, and Gatling guns, but this became repetitive during the battle and so flamethrower and sonic blaster drones were added. Additionally, the sky and environment needed to be digitally replaced in most of the sequence.[104]\n\n\nFramestore handled the \"Illusion Battle\" sequence in which Mysterio traps Spider-Man within a series of elaborate fear-based illusions. Based on early prototypes of the sequence from Framestore, Marvel decided to extend it to around 150 shots. It was heavily pre-visualized to define which background plates and motion-capture performances would be required; Framestore visual effects supervisor Alexis Wajsbrot compared the motion-capture process for the sequence to automated dialogue replacement, where each short section of the performance was captured individually. The company used existing digital assets from other vendors, including for the different Spider-Man suits, combined with new models such as those for statues of fallen heroes or a \"Zombie Iron Man\".[106][102] The effect of green smoke that is throughout the sequence was created using Houdini. Framestore took inspiration from the title sequences of the *James Bond* films, especially that of *Spectre* (2015) for the graveyard portion of the battle.[106] For the transition between the real world and the illusions, Framestore had to match a similar transition from the B.A.R.F. scene in *Captain America: Civil War* which Wajsbrot described as a time-consuming process for each environment in which it was required.[106][102] Sirrs compared the sequence to an elaborate Broadway production with an unlimited budget, and named several other visual influences including the *Looney Tunes* short *Duck Amuck* (1953), *Paprika* (2006), *A Nightmare on Elm Street* (1984), and the \"Pink Elephants on Parade\" scene from *Dumbo* (1941).[100]\n\n\n\n## Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Spider-Man: Far From Home* (soundtrack)\n\n*Spider-Man: Homecoming* composer Michael Giacchino was confirmed to return to score *Far From Home* in October 2018.[107][108] Whitney Houston's \"I Will Always Love You\" plays during the Marvel Studios opening logo as part of the film's opening \"in memoriam\" scene.[109] The end credits song is \"Vacation\" by The Go-Go's.[110] The soundtrack album was released by Sony Classical on June 28, 2019.[111]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nDue to Parker dying at the end of *Infinity War* and not being resurrected until *Endgame*,[112][113][48] Germain Lussier of io9 noted in May 2018 that Sony would either have to begin marketing this film only two months before its release or spoil the fact that Parker is resurrected for general audiences that may not realize that this would happen in *Endgame*. Lussier suggested the latter approach be taken, while a representative of Sony said the studio would be working with Marvel to \"figure out the Spider-Man strategy\".[112] Holland and Gyllenhaal debuted the first trailer for *Far From Home* at Sony's CCXP Brazil panel on December 8, 2018. The footage does not acknowledge the events of *Infinity War* or *Endgame*, with Steven Weintraub of Collider describing it as a continuation of \"the *Spider-Man* universe\" only.[114] Holland debuted the trailer publicly on his Instagram account on January 15, 2019.[115] A slightly different \"international version\" was also released.[116] Several news outlets commented on Parker's appearance in the trailer following the events of *Infinity War*,[116][117][118] with Zack Straf of IndieWire pointing out that while the trailer reveals Parker's return, it does not explain how.[117]\n\n\nAdam Chitwood of *Collider* described the trailer as \"cute and fun\" just like *Homecoming*, and approved of the vacation storyline, the addition of Fury, and Mysterio's short appearance. He did think the film looked \"the tiniest bit less special\" when compared to the acclaimed animated film *Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse*.[89] A teaser poster was released with the trailer showing Spider-Man's mask covered in travel stickers. Chitwood said the poster was \"really fun, leaning into the whole 'summer vacation' vibe\" while potentially hinting at the film's locations with the stickers.[119] Graeme McMillian of *The Hollywood Reporter* felt the trailer presented the threat of the Elementals so audiences would be \"thrown off the scent\" of Mysterio being the villain.[120] McMillian's colleague Richard Newby felt the \"main takeaway from the trailer is that *Spider-Man: Far From Home* is deftly blending old and new school elements of the Spider-Man mythos, for a result that feels surprisingly fresh\". Newby was also excited about the inclusion of Fury.[121] *Forbes*'s Scott Mendelson felt the trailer showed \"the sheer confidence\" of Sony in its Spider-Man films, especially after the successes of *Homecoming*, *Venom* (2018), and *Into the Spider-Verse*.[122] The trailer received 130 million views in 24 hours, surpassing *Homecoming* (116 million views) as the most viewed Sony Pictures trailer in that time period.[123]\n\n\nOn May 6, 2019, a second trailer for the film was released. The trailer featured an introduction from Holland warning viewers that it includes spoilers for *Avengers: Endgame*.[6] Watts, who knew the plots of *Infinity War* and *Endgame* and worked with the Russo brothers on Spider-Man's appearances in those films, was relieved that the trailer's release allowed him to speak more openly about *Far From Home*.[6] The second trailer was viewed 135 million times in 24 hours, surpassing the first *Far From Home* trailer as the most viewed Sony Pictures trailer in that time period.[124] Beginning the weekend after the trailer's release, screenings of *Endgame* began with a message from Holland telling audiences to stay till the end of the credits, with the trailer played at the end of the film. Marvel previously added a trailer for *The Avengers* (2012) to the end of *Captain America: The First Avenger* (2011).[125] United Airlines served as a promotional partner on the film, with one of their Boeing 777 aircraft and several United employees appearing in the film.[75] As done with previous MCU films, Audi also sponsored the film, promoting several vehicles such as the e-tron SUV, while having some of their other vehicles appear in the film.[126] Partnering with several other companies, including Dr Pepper, Papa John's Pizza, and Burger King, the film had a total promotional marketing value of $288 million, the largest for a film ever.[127]\n\n\nAhead of the film's home media release, in September 2019, Sony released a \"Night Monkey\" trailer, featuring footage from the film of Spider-Man in his jokey alter-ego of the same name. Lussier said the trailer was clever, and \"in terms of repurposing old footage in fun, funny new ways, you have to give Sony a tip of the cap for this.\"[128] Later in the month, Sony created a real version of the fictional TheDailyBugle.net website as part of a viral marketing campaign to promote the home media release of the film. Inspired by real-world \"conspiracy-pushing\" websites such as that of Alex Jones, the website features Simmons reprising his role as Jameson in a video where he speaks out against Spider-Man and in support of Mysterio, before adding \"Thanks for watching. Don't forget to like and subscribe!\"[129][130] The website includes testimonials from supposed victims of \"the Blip\", including one complaining that they disappeared in a dangerous situation and were seriously injured when they reappeared. This contradicts a statement by Feige saying that anyone in such a situation would have reappeared safely.[131] Several days after this was pointed out, the website was updated to say this story was faked for an insurance claim.[132]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Samuel L. Jackson at the film's Hollywood, Los Angeles, premiere in June 2019\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\n*Spider-Man: Far From Home* had its world premiere at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on June 26, 2019.[133] The film was released on June 28, in China and Japan,[134] and in the United States on July 2,[90] in 3D and IMAX.[83] In the United States, it opened in 4,634 theaters, which was second all-time behind *Avengers: Endgame*.[135] It was originally scheduled to be released on July 5.[67] The film was re-released on Labor Day weekend, beginning August 29, with four minutes of extra footage.[136] *Spider-Man: Far From Home* was the last film released in Phase Three of the MCU.[91]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Spider-Man: Far From Home* was released by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment on digital on September 17, 2019, and on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on October 1.[137] The home media release features a short film titled *Peter's To-Do List*, which uses scenes of Parker retrieving various items for his trip that were cut from the theatrical release of the film.[138] The short also includes footage featuring Hemky Madera reprising his *Homecoming* role as Mr. Delmar, the owner of a local bodega, which was all cut from *Far From Home*.[76][138]\n\n\nIn April 2021, Sony signed a deal with Disney giving them access to their legacy content, including past Spider-Man films and Marvel content in Sony's Spider-Man Universe, to stream on Disney+ and Hulu and appear on Disney's linear television networks. Disney's access to Sony's titles would come following their availability on Netflix. *Far From Home* had previously been available on Starz and FX.[139][140] The film became available on Disney+ in the United States on November 3, 2023.[141]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n*Spider-Man: Far From Home* grossed $390.5 million in the United States and Canada, and $741.3 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $1.131 billion.[2] It was the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2019[142] and the 24th-highest-grossing film of all time.[143] On August 18, 2019, the film surpassed *Skyfall* (2012) to become Sony Pictures' highest-grossing film worldwide.[144][145] *Far From Home* was the first *Spider-Man* film to gross over $1\u00a0billion.[146] *Deadline Hollywood* calculated the film's net profit as $339\u00a0million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participation, and other costs; box office grosses and home media revenues placed it seventh on their list of 2019's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".[147]\n\n\nThree weeks before its domestic release, official industry tracking had the film grossing around $170 million over its six-day opening frame. Some had the film reaching as high as $200 million, while others were at a conservative $165 million; Sony was predicting a $154 million debut.[148][149] By the week of release industry estimates lowered to $140 million, with the studio expecting $120 million, due to the recent underperformance of other sequels.[150] *Far From Home* made a Tuesday-opening record $39.3 million, including an estimated $2.8\u20133 million from midnight previews at about 1,000 theaters.[135] It then made $27 million on its second day, the best-ever Wednesday gross for an MCU film, and $25.1 million on the 4th of July, the second highest ever total for the holiday behind *Transformers* ($29 million in 2007).[151] In its opening weekend the film made $92.6 million,[152] and a total of $185.1 million over the six-day frame, topping the $180 million made by *Spider-Man 2* over its six-day July\u00a04 opening in 2004; it was the number one film for the weekend.[153] In its second weekend, the film made $45.3 million, again topping the box office with a 51% decrease from the first week; lower than *Homecoming*'s 62% drop in its second box office weekend.[154] *Far From Home* grossed over $21 million in its third weekend but was dethroned by newcomer *The Lion King*.[155] It completed its box office run as the seventh highest-grossing film of 2019 in this region.[156]\n\n\n*Far From Home* was projected to gross around $350 million worldwide by the end of its first week of release, and about $500 million over its first 10 days.[157][150] In China and Japan, where it was released a week prior to its U.S. debut, the film was expected to gross around a combined $90 million in its opening weekend.[158] In China, where pre-sale tickets were less than *Homecoming*'s, the film made $35.5 million on its first day, including $3.4 million from midnight previews (the fourth-best of all time for a superhero film in the country).[159] It ended up slightly over-performing, debuting at $111 million including $98 million in China, the fourth-best-ever superhero opening in the country.[160] *Far From Home* ended up grossing $580.1 million worldwide over its first 10 days of release, including $238 million from international territories in its opening weekend. In China, the film had a 10-day total of $167.4 million, and its other biggest debuts were in South Korea ($33.8 million), the United Kingdom ($17.8 million), Mexico ($13.9 million) and Australia ($11.9 million).[161]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 90%, with an average score of 7.4/10, based on 459 reviews. The website's critics' consensus reads, \"A breezily unpredictable blend of teen romance and superhero action, *Spider-Man: Far From Home* stylishly sets the stage for the next era of the MCU.\"[162] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 69 out of 100 based on reviews from 55 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[163] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F\u00a0scale,[164] while those at PostTrak gave it a 76% \"definite recommend\".[135]\n\n\nOwen Gleiberman of *Variety* praised Holland's performance and wrote, \"By the end, this Spider-Man really does find his tingle, yet coming after *Into the Spider-Verse*, with its swirling psychedelic imagery and identity games and trap doors of perception, *Spider-Man: Far From Home* touches all the bases of a conventional Marvel movie. It doesn't take you out of this world. But it's good enough to summon the kick\u2014or maybe just the illusion\u2014of consequence.\"[165] Writing for the *Chicago Sun-Times*, Richard Roeper gave the film 3\u00a0out of 4\u00a0stars, calling it \"zesty, sweet and satisfying\" and praised the performances of the cast.[166] Bernard Boo of *PopMatters* praised the film, commenting, \"*Spider-Man: Far From Home* is technically the final film in Phase [Three] of the MCU, and it's hard to think of a better way to send off the most successful run of one of the highest grossing franchises in history.\"[167] Alonso Duralde of *TheWrap* said that the film feels like \"a charming teen road-trip comedy that occasionally turns into a superhero movie\", which he said was a compliment. He highlighted the cast, including the chemistry between Holland, Zendaya and Batalon, and said that Gyllenhaal \"nails his character's earnestness but also clearly enjoys a few moments that let him channel every exasperated-sigh, I-just-want-to-get-this-right male diva director he's ever known.\"[168]\n\n\nWriting for IndieWire, David Ehrlich gave the film a grade of \"C\" and, despite complimenting the cast, called the film an \"unadventurous bit of superhero housekeeping that only exists to clean up the mess that *Avengers: Endgame* left behind\". He criticized the character development of Spider-Man, feeling that he does not change throughout the film beyond becoming more confident. He described the action as \"plastic\", and felt that the film did not give enough attention to its teen elements. Ehrlich said it might be enough to satisfy fans but called it a \"failure when compared to the remarkable artistry of *Into the Spider-Verse* or the raw pathos of Sam Raimi's *Spider-Man 2*.\"[169] John Anderson of *The Wall Street Journal* praised Holland and Zendaya's performances, but described the film as \"a visually incoherent, effects-heavy superhero movie\", and called the dialogue \"dire\".[170]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\n\n\nAccolades received by *Spider-Man: Far From Home*\n| Award\n | Date of ceremony\n | Category\n | Recipient(s)\n | Result\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| AACTA Awards | December 4, 2019 | Best Visual Effects or Animation | Brendan Seals, Michael Perdew, Andrew Zink, and Adam Gailey\n | Won\n | [171][172] |\n| Annie Awards | January 25, 2020 | Outstanding Achievement for Character Animation in a Live Action Production | Steven Argula and Joakim Riedinger\n | Nominated\n | [173] |\n| Critics' Choice Movie Awards | January 12, 2020 | Best Action Movie | *Spider-Man: Far From Home* | Nominated\n | [174] |\n| Dragon Awards | September 1, 2019\n | Best Science Fiction or Fantasy Movie\n | *Spider-Man: Far From Home* | Nominated\n | [175] |\n| Hollywood Critics Association Awards | January 9, 2020 | Best Blockbuster\n | *Spider-Man: Far From Home* | Nominated\n | [176][177] |\n| Hollywood Music in Media Awards | November 20, 2019\n | Best Original Score in a Sci-Fi/Fantasy Film | Michael Giacchino | Nominated\n | [178][179] |\n| Hollywood Professional Association Awards | November 12, 2019\n | Outstanding Visual Effects \u2013 Feature Film | Alexis Wajsbrot, Stephen Kennedy, Nathan McConnel, Sylvain Degrotte, and Jonathan Opgenhaffen\n | Nominated\n | [180][181] |\n| Movieguide Awards | January 24, 2020\n | Best Movie for Mature Audiences\n | *Spider-Man: Far From Home* | Nominated\n | [182] |\n| National Film & TV Awards | December 3, 2019\n | Best Feature Film\n | *Spider-Man: Far From Home* | Nominated\n | [183] |\n| Best Actor\n | Tom Holland | Nominated\n |\n| Best Supporting Actress\n | Zendaya | Nominated\n |\n| Best Supporting Actor\n | J.

It is the second Spider-Man film reboot and the 16th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Jon Watts from a screenplay by the writing teams of Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley, Watts and Christopher Ford, and Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers. Tom Holland stars as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, alongside Michael Keaton, Jon Favreau, Gwyneth Paltrow, Zendaya, Donald Glover, Jacob Batalon, Laura Harrier, Tony Revolori, Bokeem Woodbine, Tyne Daly, Marisa Tomei, and Robert Downey Jr. In the film, Peter Parker tries to balance high school life with being Spider-Man while facing the Vulture (Keaton).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn September 2019, Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures announced that they were set to produce a third film, after an impasse between the two companies during negotiations.[288] Watts returned to direct,[289] from a script by McKenna and Sommers.[290] Holland, Zendaya, Favreau, Tomei, Batalon,[291] and Revolori reprise their roles,[289] while Benedict Cumberbatch and Benedict Wong reprise their MCU roles as Doctor Strange and Wong.[292][291] Actors returning from past *Spider-Man* films include Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield returning as their versions of Spider-Man from Sam Raimi's *Spider-Man* trilogy and Marc Webb's *The Amazing Spider-Man* films, respectively,[293] alongside Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn / Green Goblin, Alfred Molina as Otto Octavius / Doctor Octopus, and Thomas Haden Church as Flint Marko / Sandman from Sam Raimi's *Spider-Man* trilogy, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn February 2015, Marvel Studios and Sony reached a deal to share the film rights for Spider-Man, integrating the character into the established MCU. The following June, Holland was cast as the title character, and Watts was hired to direct. This was followed shortly by the hiring of Daley and Goldstein. In April 2016, the film's title was revealed, along with additional cast, including Downey in his MCU role of Tony Stark / Iron Man. Principal photography began in June 2016 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, and continued in Atlanta, Los Angeles, and New York City. The other screenwriters were revealed during filming, which concluded in Berlin in October 2016. The production team made efforts to differentiate the film from previous Spider-Man films.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. **^** Young, Kai (October 25, 2023). \"Official MCU Timeline Book Admits Spider-Man: Homecoming Mistake\". *Screen Rant*.

He felt that this was also the responsibility of this film since it had to introduce Spider-Man to the already established MCU.[115] Specific comics that Watts noted as potential influences were *Ultimate Spider-Man* and *Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane*.[132] In December, Oliver Scholl signed on to be the production designer for the film.[133]\n\n\n\n### Pre-production[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nKenneth Turan of the *Los Angeles Times* gave the film a mixed review, criticizing the \"juvenile\" depiction of Parker and Watts' \"unevenly orchestrated\" direction, but feeling that the film \"finds its pace and rhythm by the end\" and praising Keaton's performance.[271] *The Hollywood Reporter*'s John DeFore found the film to be \"occasionally exciting but often frustrating\", and suggested it might have worked better if less focus had been put on integrating the film with the MCU. DeFore did praise Holland's performance as \"winning\" despite the script, and called Zendaya a scene-stealer.[272] Mick LaSalle, writing for the *San Francisco Chronicle*, said the film was a \"pretty good Spider-Man movie\" that \"breaks no new ground\", not exploring the human side of the character enough and instead focusing on action that is not thrilling.[273] At *The Telegraph*, Robbie Collin argued that \"a little of the new Spider-Man went an exhilaratingly long way in *Captain America: Civil War* last year. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nSpider-Man in other media\n |\n| --- |\n| Television | * *Spider-Man* (1967\u201370)\n* *Spidey Super Stories* (1974\u201377)\n* *The Amazing Spider-Man* (1977\u201379)\n* *Spider-Man* (1978\u201379)\n* *Spider-Man* (1981\u201382)\n* *Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends* (1981\u201383)\n* *Spider-Man* (1994\u201398)\n* *Spider-Man Unlimited* (1999\u20132001)\n* *Spider-Man: The New Animated Series* (2003)\n* *The Spectacular Spider-Man* (2008\u201309)\n* *Ultimate Spider-Man* (2012\u201317)\n* *Spider-Man* (2017\u201320)\n* *Spidey and His Amazing Friends* (2021\u2013present)\n |\n| Film | * *Spider-Man* (1977)\n* *Spider-Man* (1978)\n* *Spider-Man Strikes Back* (1978)\n* *The Dragon's Challenge* (1981)\n* *Spider-Man* (2002)\n* *Spider-Man 2* (2004)\n* *Spider-Man 3* (2007)\n* *The Amazing Spider-Man* (2012)\n* *The Amazing Spider-Man 2* (2014)\n* *Homecoming* (2017)\n* *Into the Spider-Verse* (2018)\n* *Spider-Ham: Caught in a Ham* (2019)\n* *Far From Home* (2019)\n* *No Way Home* (2021)\n* *Across the Spider-Verse* (2023)\n* *The Spider Within: A Spider-Verse Story* (2023)\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| *Spider-Man: Homecoming*\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nSpider-Man in film\n |\n| --- |\n| Franchises | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| *The Amazing Spider-Man* | * *Spider-Man* (1977)\n* *Spider-Man Strikes Back* (1978)\n* *Spider-Man: The Dragon's Challenge* (1981)\n |\n| Japanese *Spider-Man* | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Film | * *Spider-Man* (1978)\n |\n| Characters | * Takuya Yamashiro\n |\n\n |\n| *Spider-Man* | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Films | * *Spider-Man* (2002)\n* *Spider-Man 2* (2004)\n* *Spider-Man 3* (2007)\n* Accolades\n |\n| Characters | * Peter Parker\n* Mary Jane Watson\n* Harry Osborn\n* Norman Osborn\n* Otto Octavius\n* J.

Stark also builds in a \"training wheels\" protocol, to initially limit Parker's access to all of its features. Carroll noted Marvel went through the comics and \"pull[ed] out all the sort of fun and wacky things the suit did\" to include in the *Homecoming* suit.[154] Spider-Man's web-shooters have various settings, first teased at the end of *Civil War*, which Carroll explained allowed him to \"adjust the spray\" to different settings like the spinning web, web ball, or ricochet web. He compared this to a DSLR camera.[114]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHolland felt this would carry over well to the film, where other characters do not suspect Parker of being Spider-Man.[14] It took 25 to 45 minutes for Holland to get into costume, depending on if he had to wear a stunt harness underneath the suit.[13] Holland initially signed for six MCU films, including three Spider-Man films.[15]\n* Michael Keaton as Adrian Toomes / Vulture:  \n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWatts, Holland, Batalon, Harrier, Revolori, and Zendaya appeared at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con to show an exclusive clip of the film,[36][197] which also had a panel at Comic Con Experience 2016.[198] The first trailer for *Homecoming* premiered on *Jimmy Kimmel Live!* on December 8, 2016,[199] and was released online alongside an international version, which Feige thought was different enough that \"it would be fun for people to see both.\"[18] The shots of Vulture descending through a hotel atrium and Spider-Man swinging with Iron Man flying beside him were created specifically for the trailer. Watts explained that the Vulture shot was created for Comic-Con and \"was never meant to be in the movie\", but he was able to repurpose the angle for Vulture's reveal in the film. The Spider-Man and Iron Man shot was created because the marketing team wanted a shot of the two together, and existing shots \"just didn't look that great\" then. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nthe film's largest markets were China ($115.7 million),[243] South Korea ($51.4 million), and the United Kingdom ($34.8 million).[264]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tom Holland's performance as Spider-Man received praise.\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 92%, with an average score of 7.6/10, based on 400 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"*Spider-Man: Homecoming* does whatever a second reboot can, delivering a colorful, fun adventure that fits snugly in the sprawling MCU without getting bogged down in franchise-building.\"[265] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 73 out of 100, based on 51 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[266] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it an 89% overall positive score and a 74% \"definite recommend\".[103]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHowever, a small adjustment was made to a 2011 deal that gave Marvel full control of Spider-Man's merchandising rights, in exchange for a one-time payment of $175\u00a0million to Sony and paying up to $35\u00a0million for each future Spider-Man film rather than receiving their previous five percent of a Spider-Man film's revenue\u2014Marvel could now reduce their $35\u00a0million payment if the co-produced film grossed more than $750\u00a0million.[100] Marvel Studios still received five percent of first dollar gross for the film.[101] Lone Star Funds also co-financed the film with Sony, via its LSC Film Corporation deal,[102] covering 25 percent of the $175\u00a0million budget,[103] while Columbia Pictures officially served as co-producer with Marvel Studios.[104] Sony also paid Marvel Studios an undisclosed producer fee.[105]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe also said that the film hoped to use one of Spider-Man's rogues that have not been seen in film yet,[126] and that filming would begin in June 2016.[127] In July 2015, it was reported that Marisa Tomei had been offered the role of May Parker, Peter's aunt.[50] It was also revealed that Daley and Goldstein, after missing out on the director role, had begun negotiations to write the screenplay,[128] and were given three days to present Marvel with their pitch;[129] both confirmed shortly after that they had reached a deal to write the screenplay.[130] The pair had proposed a take on the character that was \"diametrically opposed\" to the previous Spider-Man films, creating a laundry list of all the elements seen in those films and actively trying to avoid re-using them. They chose to focus on the high school aspects of the character rather than the \"drama and weight of the tragedy that leads to the origin of Spider-Man\". \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n295. **^** Dornbush, Jonathon (February 24, 2021). \"Spider-Man 3's Title Is Spider-Man: No Way Home\". *IGN*.
