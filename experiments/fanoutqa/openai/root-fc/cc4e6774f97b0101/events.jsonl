It includes the monarchs of the Kingdom of France, emperors of the First and Second Empire and leaders of the five Republics. \n\n\n\n\n## Merovingian dynasty (509–751)[edit]\n\n\nThe Merovingians were a Salian Frankish dynasty that ruled the Franks for nearly 300 years in a region known as Francia in Latin, beginning in the middle of the 5th century CE. Their territory largely corresponded to ancient Gaul as well as the Roman provinces of Raetia, Germania Superior and the southern part of Germania. The Merovingian dynasty was founded by Childeric I (c. 457 – 481 CE), the son of Merovech, leader of the Salian Franks, but it was his famous son Clovis I (481–511 CE) who united all of Gaul under Merovingian rule.[1][2]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Portrait\n | Name\n | From\n | Until\n | Death\n | Relationship with his predecessors\n | Title\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | Clovis I (Clovis Ier) | 509\n | 511\n | Likely died of natural causes aged 46.

When Theuderic IV died in 737, Mayor of the Palace Charles Martel left the throne vacant and continued to rule until his own death in 741. His sons Pepin and Carloman briefly restored the Merovingian dynasty by raising Childeric III to the throne in 743. In 751, Pepin deposed Childerich and acceded to the throne.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Portrait\n | Name\n | From\n | Until\n | Death\n | Relationship with his predecessors\n | Title\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | Childeric III (Childéric III) | 743\n | November 751\n | Died aged 37.\n |  • Son of Chilperic II or of Theuderic IV\n | King of the Franks (Roi des Francs) |\n\n\n## Carolingian dynasty (751–888)[edit]\n\n\nThe Carolingian dynasty was a Frankish noble family with origins in the Arnulfing and Pippinid clans of the 7th century AD. The family consolidated its power in the late 8th century, eventually making the offices of Mayor of the Palace and *dux et princeps Francorum* hereditary and becoming the *de facto* rulers of the Franks as the real powers behind the throne. By 751, the Merovingian dynasty, which until then had ruled the Germanic Franks by right, was deprived of this right with the consent of the Papacy and the aristocracy, and a Carolingian, Pepin the Short, was crowned King of the Franks.[3][2]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Portrait\n | Name\n | From\n | Until\n | Relationship with his predecessors\n | Title\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | Pepin *the Younger*, *the Short* (Pépin *le Bref*) | 751\n | 24 September 768\n |  • Son of Charles Martel | King of the Franks (Roi des Francs) |\n| ![](image) | Carloman I | 24 September 768\n | 4 December 771\n |  • Son of Pepin the Short\n | King of the Franks (Roi des Francs) |\n| ![](image) | Charlemagne (Charles I, *the Great*)\n | 24 September 768\n | 28 January 814\n |  • Son of Pepin the Short\n | King of the Franks (Roi des Francs) Emperor of the Romans (Imperator Romanorum) (800–814)\n |\n| ![](image) | Louis I *the Pious, the Debonaire* (Louis Ier *le Pieux, le Débonnaire*) | 28 January 814\n | 20 June 840\n |  • Son of Charlemagne\n | King of the Franks (Roi des Francs) Emperor of the Romans (Imperator Romanorum) |\n| ![](image) | Charles II *the Bald* (Charles II *le Chauve*) | 20 June 840\n | 6 October 877\n |  • Son of Louis I\n | King of the Franks (Roi des Francs) Emperor of the Romans (Imperator Romanorum)  (875–877)\n |\n| ![](image) | Louis II *the Stammerer* (Louis II *le Bègue*) | 6 October 877\n | 10 April 879\n |  • Son of Charles II\n | King of the Franks (Roi des Francs) |\n| ![](image) | Louis III | 10 April 879\n | 5 August 882\n |  • Son of Louis II\n | King of the Franks (Roi des Francs) |\n| ![](image) | Carloman II | 5 August 882\n | 6 December 884\n |  • Son of Louis II\n | King of the Franks (Roi des Francs) |\n| ![](image) | Charles III *the Fat* (Charles *le Gros*) | 20 May 885\n | 13 January 888\n |  • Son of Louis the German • Cousin of Louis II and Carloman II • Grandson of Louis I *the Pious* | King of the Franks (Roi des Francs) Emperor of the Romans (Imperator Romanorum)  (881–887)\n |\n\n\n## Robertian dynasty (888–898)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Robertian dynasty\n\nThe Robertians were Frankish noblemen owing fealty to the Carolingians, and ancestors of the subsequent Capetian dynasty.

The Capetian Dynasty, the male-line descendants of Hugh Capet, ruled France continuously from 987 to 1792 and again from 1814 to 1848. They were direct descendants of the Robertian kings. The cadet branches of the dynasty which ruled after 1328, however, are generally given the specific branch names of *Valois* and *Bourbon*.\n\n\nNot listed below are Hugh Magnus, eldest son of Robert II, and Philip of France, eldest son of Louis VI; both were co-Kings with their fathers (in accordance with the early Capetian practice whereby kings would crown their heirs in their own lifetimes and share power with the co-king), but predeceased them. Because neither Hugh nor Philip were sole or senior king in their own lifetimes, they are not traditionally listed as Kings of France, and are not given ordinals.\n\n\nHenry VI of England, son of Catherine of Valois, became titular King of France upon his grandfather Charles VI's death in accordance with the Treaty of Troyes of 1420 however this was disputed and he is not always regarded as a legitimate king of France.\n\n\nFrom 21 January 1793 to 8 June 1795, Louis XVI's son Louis-Charles was the titular King of France as Louis XVII; in reality, however, he was imprisoned in the Temple throughout this duration, and power was held by the leaders of the Republic. Upon Louis XVII's death, his uncle (Louis XVI's brother) Louis-Stanislas claimed the throne, as Louis XVIII, but only became *de facto* King of France in 1814.\n\n\n\n### House of Capet (987–1328)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: House of Capet\n\n\n\n| Portrait\n | Coat of arms\n | Name\n | From\n | Until\n | Relationship with his predecessors\n | Title\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) |  | Hugh Capet (Hugues Capet) | 3 July 987 | 24 October 996 |  • Grandson of Robert I[2] | King of the Franks (Roi des Francs) |\n| ![](image) |  | Robert II *the Pious, the Wise* (Robert II *le Pieux, le Sage*) | 24 October 996 | 20 July 1031 |  • Son of Hugh Capet\n | King of the Franks (Roi des Francs) |\n| ![](image) |  | Henry I(Henri Ier) | 20 July 1031 | 4 August 1060 |  • Son of Robert II\n | King of the Franks (Roi des Francs) |\n| ![](image) |  | Philip I *the Amorous*(Philippe Ier *l' Amoureux*) | 4 August 1060 | 29 July 1108 |  • Son of Henry I\n | King of the Franks (Roi des Francs) |\n| ![](image) |  | Louis VI *the Fat* (Louis VI *le Gros*) | 29 July 1108 | 1 August 1137 |  • Son of Philip I\n | King of the Franks (Roi des Francs) |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Louis VII *the Young* (Louis VII *le Jeune*) | 1 August 1137 | 18 September 1180 |  • Son of Louis VI\n | King of the Franks (Roi des Francs) |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Philip II *Augustus* (Philippe II *Auguste*) | 18 September 1180 | 14 July 1223 |  • Son of Louis VII\n | King of the Franks (Roi des Francs)first monarch to use the title of *King of France*(Roi de France) |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Louis VIII *the Lion* (Louis VIII *le Lion*) | 14 July 1223 | 8 November 1226 |  • Son of Philip II Augustus\n | King of France (Roi de France) |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Louis IX *the Saint* (Saint Louis) | 8 November 1226 | 25 August 1270 |  • Son of Louis VIII\n | King of France (Roi de France) |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Philip III *the Bold* (Philippe III *le Hardi*) | 25 August 1270 | 5 October 1285 |  • Son of Louis IX\n | King of France (Roi de France) |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Philip IV *the Fair*, *the Iron King* (Philippe IV *le Bel*) | 5 October 1285 | 29 November 1314 |  • Son of Philip III\n | King of France and of Navarre (Roi de France et de Navarre) |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Louis X *the Quarreller* (Louis X *le Hutin*) | 29 November 1314 | 5 June 1316 |  • Son of Philip IV\n | King of France and of Navarre (Roi de France et de Navarre) |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | John I *the Posthumous* (Jean Ier *le Posthume*) | 15 November 1316 | 20 November 1316 |  • Son of Louis X\n | King of France and of Navarre (Roi de France et de Navarre) |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Philip V *the Tall* (Philippe V *le Long*) | 20 November 1316 | 3 January 1322 |  • Son of Philip IV • Younger brother of Louis X\n | King of France and of Navarre (Roi de France et de Navarre) |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Charles IV *the Fair* (Charles IV *le Bel*) | 3 January 1322 | 1 February 1328 |  • Son of Philip IV • Younger brother of Louis X and Philip V\n | King of France and of Navarre (Roi de France et de Navarre) |\n\n\n### House of Valois (1328–1589)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: House of Valois\n\n\n\n| Portrait\n | Coat of arms\n | Name\n | From\n | Until\n | Relationship with his predecessors\n | Title\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Philip VI *of Valois*, *the Fortunate* (Philippe VI *de Valois*, *le Fortuné*) | 1 April 1328 | 22 August 1350 |  • Grandson of Philip III of France[6] | King of France (Roi de France) |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | John II *the Good* (Jean II *le Bon*) | 22 August 1350 | 8 April 1364 |  • Son of Philip VI\n | King of France (Roi de France) |\n| ![](image) | ![](image)![](image) | Charles V *the Wise* (Charles V *le Sage*) | 8 April 1364 | 16 September 1380 |  • Son of John II\n | King of France (Roi de France) |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Charles VI *the Beloved*, *the Mad* (Charles VI *le Bienaimé*, *le Fol*) | 16 September 1380 | 21 October 1422 |  • Son of Charles V\n | King of France (Roi de France) |\n\n\n### House of Lancaster (1422–1453), disputed[edit]\n\n\nMain article: House of Lancaster\n\nFrom 1340 to 1801 (but not from 1360 to 1369), the Kings of England and Great Britain claimed the title of King of France. Under the terms of the 1420 Treaty of Troyes, Charles VI had recognized his son-in-law Henry V of England as regent and heir. Henry V predeceased Charles VI and so Henry V's son, Henry VI, succeeded his grandfather Charles VI as King of France. Most of Northern France was under English control until 1435, but by 1453, the English had been expelled from all of France save Calais (and the Channel Islands), and Calais itself fell in 1558. Nevertheless, English and then British monarchs continued to claim the title for themselves until the creation of the United Kingdom in 1801.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Portrait\n | Coat of arms\n | Name\n | From\n

Historians generally divide the Convention's activities into three periods, moderate, radical, and reaction, and the policies of presidents of the Convention reflect these distinctions. During the radical and reaction phases, some of the presidents were executed, most by guillotine, committed suicide, or were deported. In addition, some of the presidents were later deported during the Bourbon Restoration in 1815.\n\n\n\n### Establishment of the Convention[edit]\n\n\nThe National Convention governed France from 20 September 1792 until 26 October 1795 during the most critical period of the French Revolution. The election of the National Convention took place in September 1792 after the election of the electoral colleges by primary regional assemblies on 26 August. Owing to the abstention of aristocrats and the anti-republicans, and the general fear of victimization, the voter turnout in the departments was low – as little as 7.5 percent or as much as 11.9% of the electorate, compared to 10.2% in the 1791 elections, despite the doubling of the number of eligible voters.[7]\n\n\nInitially elected to provide a new constitution after the overthrow of the monarchy on 10 August 1792, the Convention included 749 deputies drawn from businesses and trades, and from such professions as law, journalism, medicine, and the clergy. Among its earliest acts was the formal abolition of the monarchy, through Proclamation, on 21 September, and the subsequent establishment of the Republic on 22 September. The French Republican Calendar discarded all Christian reference points and calculated time from the Republic's first full day after the monarchy – 22 September 1792, the first day of Year One.[8][9]\n\n\nAccording to its own rules, the Convention elected its President every fortnight (two weeks). He was eligible for re-election after the lapse of a fortnight. Ordinarily the sessions were held in the morning, but evening sessions also occurred frequently, often extending late into the night. In exceptional circumstances, the Convention declared itself in permanent session and sat for several days without interruption. For both legislative and administrative deliberations, the Convention used committees, with powers more or less widely extended and regulated by successive laws.[10] The most famous of these committees included the Committee of Public Safety and the Committee of General Security.[9]\n\n\nThe Convention held both legislative and executive powers during the first years of the French First Republic and had three distinct periods: Girondins (moderate), Montagnard (radical) and Thermidorian (reaction). The Montagnards favored granting the poorer classes more political power; the Girondins favored a bourgeois republic and wanted to reduce the power and influence of Paris over the course of the revolution. A popular uprising in Paris helped to purge the Convention of the Girondins between 31 May and 2 June 1793;[9] the last of the Girondins served as presidents in late July.[11]\n\n\nIn its second phase, the Montagnards controlled the convention (June 1793 to July 1794). War and an internal rebellion convinced the revolutionary government to establish a Committee of Public Safety which exercised near dictatorial power. Consequently, the democratic constitution, approved by the convention on 24 June 1793, did not go into effect and the Convention lost its legislative initiative.[9] The rise of Mountaineers (Montagnards) corresponded with the decline of the Girondins. The Girondin party had hesitated on the correct course of action to take with Louis XVI after his attempt to flee France on 20 June 1791. Some elements of the Girondin party believed they could use the king as figurehead. While the Girondins hesitated, the Montagnards took a united stand during the trial in December 1792 – January 1793 and favored the king's execution.[12] Riding on this victory, the Montagnards then sought to discredit the Girondins using tactics previously used against themselves, denouncing the Girondins as liars and enemies of the Revolution.[13] The last quarter of the year was marked by the Reign of Terror (5 September 1793 – 28 July 1794),[14] also known as The Terror (French: *la Terreur*), a period of violence incited by conflict between these rival political factions, the Girondins and the Jacobins, and marked by mass executions of \"enemies of the revolution\". The death toll ranged in the tens of thousands, with 16,594 executed by guillotine (2,639 in Paris),[13] and another 25,000 in summary executions across France.[15] Most of the Parisian victims of the guillotine filled the Madeleine, Mosseaux (also called Errancis), and Picpus cemeteries.[16]\n\n\nIn the third phase, called Thermidor after the month in which it began, many of the members of the Convention overthrew the most prominent member of the committee, Maximilien Robespierre. This reaction to the radical influence of the Committee of Public Safety reestablished the balance of power in the hands of the moderate deputies. The Girondins who had survived the 1793 purge were recalled and the leading Montagnards were themselves purged, and many executed. In August 1795, the Convention approved the Constitution for the regime that replaced it, the bourgeois-dominated Directory, which exercised power from 1795 to 1799, when a coup d'etat by Napoleon Bonaparte overthrew it.[9]\n\n\n\n### Moderate Phase: September 1792 – June 1793[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Girondin and The Plain\n\nInitially, *La Marais*, or The Plain, a moderate, amorphous group, controlled the Convention. At the first session, held on 20 September 1792, the elder statesman Philippe Rühl presided over the session. The following day, amidst profound silence, the proposition was put to the assembly, \"*That royalty be abolished in France*\"; it carried, with cheers. On the 22nd came the news of the Republic's victory at the Battle of Valmy. On the same day, the Convention decreed that \"in future, the acts of the assembly shall be dated *First Year of the French Republic*\". Three days later, the Convention added the corollary of \"*the French republic is one and indivisible*\", to guard against federalism.[17]\n\n\nThe following men were elected for two-week terms as Presidents, or executives, of the Convention.[18]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Image\n | Dates\n | Name\n | Fate\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | 20 September 1792 | Philippe Rühl | Suicide, 29/30 May 1795\n |\n| ![](image) | 20 September 1792  – 4 October 1792 | Jérôme Pétion de Villeneuve | Botched suicide, guillotined 18 June 1794\n |\n| ![](image) | 4 October 1792  – 18 October 1792 | Jean-François Delacroix | Guillotined with Georges Danton, 5 April 1794\n |\n| ![](image) | 18 October 1792  – 1 November 1792 | Marguerite-Élie Guadet | Guillotined 17 June 1794\n |\n| ![](image) | 1 November 1792  – 15 November 1792 | Marie-Jean Hérault de Séchelles | Guillotined with Georges Danton, 5 April 1794\n |\n| ![](image) | 15 November 1792  – 29 November 1792 | Henri Grégoire | Died 28 May 1831\n |\n| ![](image) | 29 November 1792 – 13 December 1792 | Bertrand Barère de Vieuzac | Died 13 January 1841\n |\n| ![portrait of Jacques defermon](image) | 13 December 1792  – 27 December 1792 | Jacques Defermon des Chapelieres | 20 June 1831\n |\n| ![](image) | 27 December 1792  – 10 January 1793 | Jean-Baptiste Treilhard | Died 1 December 1810\n |\n| ![](image) | 10 January 1793  – 24 January 1793 | Pierre Victurnien Vergniaud | 31 October 1793, guillotined.\n |\n| ![](image) | 24 January 1793  – 7 February 1793 | Jean-Paul Rabaut Saint-Étienne | 5 December 1793, guillotined\n |\n| ![](image) | 7 February 1793  – 21 February 1793 | Jean-Jacques Bréard, dit Bréard-Duplessis\n | 2 January 1840\n |\n| ![](image) | 21 February 1793  – 7 March 1793 | Edmond Louis Alexis Dubois-Crancé | 29 June 1814\n |\n| ![](image) | 7 March 1793  – 21 March 1793 | Armand Gensonné | 31 October 1793, guillotined\n |\n| ![](image) | 21 March 1793  – 4 April 1793 | Jean Antoine Joseph Debry | 6 January 1834, Paris\n |\n|  | 4 April 1793  – 18 April 1793 | Jean-François-Bertrand Delmas | Disappeared 19 August 1798[Notes 1] |\n|  | 18 April 1793  – 2 May 1793 | Marc David Alba Lasource | 31 October 1793, guillotined with the Girondists\n |\n| ![](image) | 2 May 1793  – 16 May 1793 | Jean-Baptiste Boyer-Fonfrède | 31 October 1793, guillotined\n |\n| ![](image) | 16 May 1793  – 30 May 1793 | Maximin Isnard | 12 March 1825\n |\n|  | 30 May 1793  – 13 June 1793 | François-René-Auguste Mallarmé | 25 July 1835\n |\n\n\nAt the end of May 1793, an uprising of the Parisian *sans culottes*, the day-laborers and working class, undermined much of the authority of the moderate Girondins.[19] At this point, although Danton and Hérault de Séchelles both served one more term each as Presidents of the Convention, the Girondins had lost control of the Convention: in June and July compromise after compromise changed the course of the revolution from a bourgeois event to a radical, working class event. Price controls were introduced and a minimum wage guaranteed to workers and soldiers. Over the course of the summer, the government became truly revolutionary.[20]\n\n\n\n### Radical phase: June 1793 – July 1794[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Insurrection of 31 May – 2 June 1793 and Reign of Terror\n\nAfter the insurrection, any attempted resistance to revolutionary ideals was crushed. The insurrection of 31 May – 2 June 1793 marked a significant milestone in the history of the French Revolution. The days of 31 May – 2 June (French: *journées*) resulted in the fall of the Girondin party under pressure of the Parisian *sans-culottes*, Jacobins of the clubs, and Montagnards in the National Convention. The following men were elected as presidents of the Convention during its transition from its moderate to radical phase.[11]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Portrait\n | Dates\n | Name\n | Death\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | 13 June 1793  – 27 June 1793 | Jean-Marie Collot d'Herbois | 8 June 1796, deported to French Guiana, died of yellow fever |\n|  | 27 June 1793  – 11 July 1793 | Jacques Alexis Thuriot de la Rosière | 20 June 1829, died in exile\n |\n| ![](image) | 11 July 1793  – 25 July 1793 | Andre Jeanbon Saint Andre | 10 December 1813\n |\n| ![](image) | 25 July 1793  – 8 August 1793 | Georges Jacques Danton | A moderate guillotined by the radicals, 5 April 1794\n |\n| ![](image) | 8 August 1793  – 22 August 1793 | Marie-Jean Hérault de Séchelles | Guillotined with Georges Danton, 5 April 1794\n |\n\n\n*After 1793, President of the National Convention became a puppet office under the Committee of Public Safety*\nThe following men were elected as presidents of the Convention during its radical phase.[11]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Portrait\n | Dates\n | Name\n | Death\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | 22 August 1793  – 5 September 1793 | Maximilien Robespierre | 28 July 1794, guillotined during the Reaction\n |\n| File:Jacques Nicolas Billaud-Varenne engraving.jpg | 5 September 1793  – 19 September 1793 | Jacques Nicolas Billaud-Varenne | 3 June 1819\n |\n| ![](image) | 19 September 1793  – 3 October 1793 | Pierre Joseph Cambon | 15 February 1820\n |\n|  | 3 October 1793  – 22 October 1793 | Louis-Joseph Charlier | 23 February 1797\n |\n|  | 22 October 1793  – 6 November 1793 | Moïse Antoine Pierre Jean Bayle | 1812 or 1815\n |\n|  | 6 November 1793  – 21 November 1793 | Pierre-Antoine Lalloy | 16 March 1846\n |\n| ![](image) | 21 November 1793  – 6 December 1793 | Charles-Gilbert Romme | 17 June 1795, suicide prior to guillotine\n |\n|  | 6 December 1793  – 21 December 1793 | Jean-Henri Voulland | 23 February 1801\n |\n| ![](image) | 21 December 1793 – 5 January 1794 | Georges Auguste Couthon | 28 July 1794, guillotined during the ReactionOne of the few members of *La Marais* to be elected President\n |\n| ![](image) | 5 January 1794  – 20 January 1794 | Jacques-Louis David | 29 December 1825\n |\n| ![](image) | 20 January 1794  – 4 February 1794 | Marc Guillaume Alexis Vadier | 14 December 1828\n |\n|  | 4 February 1794  – 19 February 1794 | Joseph-Nicolas Barbeau du Barran | 16 May 1816, exiled in Switzerland during Bourbon Restoration |\n| ![](image) | 19 February 1794  – 6 March 1794 | Louis Antoine de Saint-Just | 28 July 1794, guillotine during Reaction\n |\n|  | 7 March 1794  – 21 March 1794 | Philippe Rühl | 29/30 May 1795, suicide\n |\n| ![](image) | 21 March 1794  – 5 April 1794 | Jean-Lambert Tallien | 16 November 1820\n |\n|  | 5 April 1794  – 20 April 1794 | Jean-Baptiste-André Amar | 21 December 1816\n |\n| ![](image) | 20 April 1794  – 5 May 1794 | Robert Lindet | 17 February 1825\n |\n| ![](image) | 5 May 1794  – 20 May 1794 | Lazare Carnot | 2 August 1823\n |\n| ![](image) | 20 May 1794  – 4 June 1794 | Claude-Antoine Prieur-Duvernois | 11 August 1832\n |\n| ![](image) | 4 June 1794  – 19 June 1794 | Maximilien Robespierre | 28 July 1794, guillotined during the Reaction\n |\n|  | 19 June 1794  – 5 July 1794 | Élie Lacoste | 26 November 1806\n |\n|  | 5 July 1794  – 19 July 1794 | Jean-Antoine Louis, also called Louis du Bas-Rhin\n |  |\n\n\n### Reaction: July 1794–1795[edit]\n\n\nSee also: The Mountain and Thermidorian Reaction\n\nIn 1794, Maximilien Robespierre continued to consolidate his power over the Montagnards with the use of the Committee of Public Safety.[21] By late spring, the moderate members of the Convention had had enough. They began to conspire secretly against Robespierre and his allies. The Thermidorian Reaction was a revolt within the Convention against the leadership of the Jacobin Club over the Committee of Public Safety. The National Convention voted to remove Maximilien Robespierre, Louis Antoine de Saint-Just, and several other leading members of the revolutionary government, and they were executed the following day. This ended the most radical phase of the French Revolution.[22][Notes 2]\n\n\nThe following men were Presidents of the Convention until its end.[11]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Portrait\n | Dates\n | Name\n | Death\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | 19 July 1794  – 3 August 1794 | Jean-Marie Collot d'Herbois | 8 June 1796\n |\n| ![](image) | 3 August 1794  – 18 August 1794 | Philippe Antoine Merlin, dit Merlin de Douai\n | 26 December 1838\n |\n|  | 18 August 1794  – 2 September 1794 | Antoine Merlin de Thionville | 14 September 1833\n |\n| ![](image) | 2 September 1794  – 22 September 1794 | André Antoine Bernard, dit Bernard de Saintes\n | 19 October 1818\n |\n|  | 22 September 1794  – 7 October 1794 | André Dumont | 19 October 1838\n |\n| ![](image) | 7 October 1794  – 22 October 1794 | Jean-Jacques-Régis de Cambacérès | 8 March 1824One of the few members of *La Marais* to be elected President Authored Napoleon's Civil Code |\n| ![](image) | 22 October 1794  – 6 November 1794 | Pierre-Louis Prieur, dit Prieur de la Marne\n | 31 May 1827\n |\n| ![](image) | 6 November 1794  – 24 November 1794 | Louis Legendre | 13 December 1797, died of natural causes (dementia)\n |\n|  | 24 November 1794  – 6 December 1794 | Jean-Baptiste Clauzel | 2 July 1803\n |\n| ![](image) | 6 December 1794  – 21 December 1794 | Jean-François Reubell | 23 November 1807\n |\n|  | 21 December 1794  – 6 January 1795 | Pierre-Louis Bentabole | 1797\n |\n| ![](image) | 6 January 1795  – 20 January 1795 | Étienne-François Le Tourneur | 4 October 1817\n |\n| ![](image) | 20 January 1795  – 4 February 1795 | Stanislas Joseph François Xavier Rovère | died in 1798 in French Guiana\n |\n| ![](image) | 4 February 1795  – 19 February 1795 | Paul Barras | 29 January 1829\n |\n| ![](image) | 19 February 1795  – 6 March 1795 | François Louis Bourdon | 22 June 1798, after being deported to French Guiana\n |\n| ![](image) | 6 March 1795  – 24 March 1795 | Antoine Claire Thibaudeau | 8 March 1854\n |\n| ![](image) | 24 March 1795  – 5 April 1795 | Jean Pelet, also Pelet de la Lozère\n | 26 January 1842\n |\n| ![](image) | 5 April 1795  – 20 April 1795 | François-Antoine de Boissy d'Anglas | 1828One of the few members of *La Marais* to be elected President\n |\n| ![](image) | 20 April 1795  – 5 May 1795 | Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès | 20 June 1836One of the few members of *La Marais* to be elected President\n |\n| ![](image) | 5 May 1795  – 26 May 1795 | Théodore Vernier |  |\n|  | 26 May 1795  – 4 June 1795 | Jean-Baptiste Charles Matthieu |  |\n| ![](image) | 4 June 1795  – 19 June 1795 | Jean Denis, comte Lanjuinais | died in 1828 in Paris\n |\n| ![](image) | 19 June 1795  – 4 July 1795 | Jean-Baptiste Louvet de Couvray | 25 August 1797\n |\n| ![](image) | 4 July 1795  – 19 July 1795 | Louis-Gustave Doulcet de Pontécoulant | 17 November 1764 – 3 April 1853\n |\n| ![](image) | 19 July 1795  – 3 August 1795 | Louis-Marie de La Révellière-Lépeaux | 24 March 1824\n |\n| ![](image) | 3 August 1795  – 19 August 1795 | Pierre Claude François Daunou | 20 June 1840\n |\n| ![](image) | 19 August 1795  – 2 September 1795 | Marie-Joseph Chénier | 10 January 1811\n |\n|  | 2 September 1795  – 23 September 1795 | Théophile Berlier | 12 September 1844\n |\n|  | 23 September 1795  – 8 October 1795 | Pierre-Charles-Louis Baudin | 1799\n |\n|  | 8 October 1795  – 26 October 1795 | Jean Joseph Victor Génissieu | 27 October 1804\n |\n\n\n### Presidents of the Committee of Public Safety[edit]\n\n\nPolitical parties\n\n  Montagnard  \n\n  Thermidorian  \n\n  Marais\n\n\n\n\n\n| No.\n | Portrait\n | Name(birth and death) | Term of office\n | Political party\n | Ref.\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image) | **Georges Danton**(1759–1794) | 6 April 1793\n | 27 July 1793\n | Montagnard | [23] |\n|  When all executive power was conferred upon a Committee of Public Safety, Danton had been one of the nine original members of that body.

Administered by a collective leadership of five directors, it preceded the Consulate established in a coup d'etat by Napoleon. It lasted from 2 November 1795 until 10 November 1799, a period commonly known as the \"Directory era\". The directory operated with a bicameral structure. A Council of the Ancients, selected by lot, named the directors. For its own security, the Left (whose members dominated the Council) resolved that all five must be old members of the Convention and regicides who had voted to execute King Louis XVI. The Ancients chose Jean-François Rewbell; Paul François Jean Nicolas, vicomte de Barras; Louis Marie de La Révellière-Lépeaux; Lazare Nicolas Marguerite Carnot; and Étienne-François Le Tourneur.[11]\n\n\nThe Directory was officially led by a president, as stipulated by Article 141 of the Constitution of the Year III. An entirely ceremonial post, the first president was Rewbell who was chosen by lot on 2 November 1795. The directors conducted their elections privately, with the presidency rotating every three months.[26] The last president was Gohier.[27]\n\n\nThe key figure of the Directory was Paul Barras, the only Director to serve throughout the Directory.\n\n\n\n\n\n| **Directors of the Directory (1 November 1795 – 10 November 1799)** |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Paul Barras | ![](image)Louis-Marie de La Révellière-Lépeaux | ![](image)Jean-François Rewbell | ![](image)Lazare Carnot | ![](image)Étienne-François Letourneur |\n| Letourneur drawn by lot to be replaced1 Prairial year V (20 May 1797). |\n| ![](image)François Barthélemy |\n| Barthélemy & Carnot proscribed and replaced afterCoup of 18 Fructidor year V (4 Sept. 1797). |\n| ![](image)Philippe-Antoine Merlin de Douai | ![](image)François de Neufchâteau |\n| Neufchâteau drawn by lot to be replaced26 Floréal year VI (15 May 1798). |\n| ![](image)Jean-Baptiste Treilhard |\n| Rewbell drawn by lot to be replaced27 Floréal year VII (16 May 1799). |\n| ![](image)Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyès |\n| Compelled to resign,30 Prairial year VII (18 June 1799). | Compelled to resign,30 Prairial year VII (18 June 1799). | Treilhard's election annulled as irregular,29 Prairial year VII (17 June 1799). |\n| ![](image)Roger Ducos | Jean-François-Auguste Moulin | ![](image)Louis-Jérôme Gohier |\n| After the Coup of 18 Brumaire (9 November 1799), Barras, Ducos & Sieyès resigned.Moulin & Gohier, refusing to resign, were arrested by General Moreau. |\n\n\n#### The Consulate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: French Consulate\n\n\n\n| **The provisional Consuls (10 November – 12 December 1799)** |\n| --- |\n| With the Coup of 18 Brumaire in 1799, the Directory was abolished, and a provisional committee of three Consuls took power. |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Napoleon Bonaparte | Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès | Roger Ducos |\n| **The Consuls (12 December 1799 – 18 May 1804)** |\n| With the Constitution of the Year VIII (December 1799), Bonaparte became First Consul for ten years, with two consuls appointed by him who had consultative voices only.With the Constitution of the Year X (August 1802), Bonaparte became First Consul for life, establishing a *de facto* dictatorship. |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Napoleon BonaparteFirst Consul\n | J.J.R. de CambacérèsSecond Consul\n | Charles-François LebrunThird Consul\n |\n| Napoleon took the title Emperor of the French on 18 May 1804, ending the Consulate and establishing the First French Empire. |\n\n\n## House of Bonaparte, First Empire (1804–1814)[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: House of Bonaparte and First French Empire\n\n\n\n| Portrait\n | Coat of arms\n | Name\n | From\n | Until\n | Title\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Napoleon I, *the Great*(Napoléon Ier, le Grand) | 18 May 1804 | 11 April 1814[2] | Emperor of the French (Empereur des Français) |\n\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte became Emperor in 1804 following a referendum. He received the title Emperor of the French to differentiate himself from the previous monarchs. His rule saw the domination of France as it crushed the Prussians, Russians, Austrians and British alike. Napoleon's rule lasted from 1804 to 1814 when after many coalitions against him he was defeated by the combined might of the other powers of Europe. He would then be exiled to the Island of Elba off the coast of Italy. However he was given the island to run as the Emperor of Elba.\n\n\n\n## Capetian Dynasty (1814–1815)[edit]\n\n\n### House of Bourbon, Bourbon Restoration (1814–1815)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bourbon Restoration in France\n\n\n\n| Portrait\n | Coat of arms\n | Name\n | From\n | Until\n | Relationship with his predecessors\n | Title\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Louis XVIII | 11 April 1814 | 20 March 1815 |  • Grandson of Louis XV  • Younger brother of Louis XVI[2] | King of France and of Navarre (Roi de France et de Navarre) |\n\n\n## House of Bonaparte, First Empire (Hundred Days, 1815)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hundred Days\n\n\n\n| Portrait\n | Coat of arms\n | Name\n | From\n | Until\n | Relationship with his predecessor\n | Title\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Napoleon I (Napoléon Ier) | 20 March 1815 | 22 June 1815[2] | *None* | Emperor of the French (Empereur des Français) |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Napoleon II(Napoléon II) [n 1] | 22 June 1815 | 7 July 1815\n |  • Son of Napoleon I\n | Emperor of the French (Empereur des Français) |\n\n\n## Capetian Dynasty (1815–1848)[edit]\n\n\n### House of Bourbon (1815–1830)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Portrait\n | Coat of arms\n | Name\n | From\n | Until\n | Relationship with his predecessor\n | Title\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Louis XVIII | 7 July 1815 | 16 September 1824[2] |  • Grandson of Louis XV  • Younger brother of Louis XVI\n | King of France and of Navarre (Roi de France et de Navarre) |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Charles X | 16 September 1824 | 2 August 1830 |  • Grandson of Louis XV  • Younger Brother of Louis XVI and Louis XVIII\n | King of France and of Navarre (Roi de France et de Navarre) |\n\n\n### Revolution of 1830[edit]\n\n\nFor a few days during the July Revolution, Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette held executive power and was offered the presidency of a Republic.

Due to his great age (upon entering office, he was just a few days short of his 81st birthday), Dupont de l'Eure effectively delegated part of his duties to Minister of Foreign Affairs Alphonse de Lamartine. On 4 May, he resigned in order to make way for the Executive Commission, which he declined to join. |\n| **Executive Commission** |\n| –\n | ![](image) | Executive Commission:\n* François Arago (*President*)\n* Alphonse de Lamartine\n* Louis-Antoine Garnier-Pagès\n* Alexandre Auguste Ledru-Rollin\n* Pierre Marie de Saint-Georges\n | 9 May 1848\n | 24 June 1848\n | Moderate Republican |  |\n| In May 1848 the National Assembly decided to establish the Executive Commission as a form of collective presidency, similar to that of Year III in the first French Revolution.

He soon faced a global economic crisis and rising unemployment. Although the polls initially gave him a lead, he was defeated in the 1981 election by François Mitterrand, partly due to the disunion within the right wing. |\n| 21\n | ![](image) | **François Mitterrand**(1916–1996) | 21 May 1981 | 17 May 1995\n | Socialist Party (PS)\n | [49] |\n| 1981, 1988 |\n| Candidate of a united left-wing ticket in the 1965 election, he founded the Socialist Party in 1971.

He engaged in social reforms to counter \"social fracture\". In 1997, he dissolved the Assemblée nationale; a left-wing victory in the 1997 legislative elections, forced him to name Lionel Jospin Prime Minister for a five-year cohabitation. Presidential terms reduced from seven to five years. In 2002, he was re-elected against the leader of the extreme right-wing Jean-Marie Le Pen. Opposed the Iraq War.

The Prussian-led North German Confederation (1866-1871) subsequently morphed into a modern nation state, the German Reich, which was ruled by emperors from 1871 to the collapse of all German monarchies in 1918.\n\n\nThe President of Germany replaced the monarch in 1919. Chancellor Adolf Hitler assumed the duties of head of state as *Führer and Chancellor* from 1934 until his suicide in April 1945. In 1949, Germany was divided into two states. The Federal President, head of state of West Germany, became head of state for all of Germany following German reunification in 1990.\n\n\n\n### East Frankish kingdom, 843–962[edit]\n\n\n#### Carolingians[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Seal/Portrait\n | Name\n | House\n | King\n | Emperor\n | Ended\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | Louis the GermanLudwig der Deutsche | Carolingian | 11 August 843\n | —\n | 23 August 876\n | Son of Emperor Louis the Pious and grandson of Charlemagne |\n| ![](image) | Carloman(Karlmann) | Carolingian | 28 August\n876\n | —\n | 22 March 880\n | Son of Louis the German; ruled in Bavaria; from 877, also King of Italy\n |\n| ![](image) | Louis the Younger(Ludwig III. der Jüngere) | Carolingian | 28 August 876\n | —\n | 20 January 882\n | Son of Louis the German; ruled in East Francia, Saxony; from 880, also Bavaria |\n| ![](image) | **Charles the Fat**(Karl III. der Dicke) | Carolingian | 28 August 876\n | 12 February 881\n | 11 November 887\n | Son of Louis the German; ruled in Alemannia, Raetia, from 882 in the entire Eastern Kingdom; from 879, also King of Italy\n |\n| ![](image) | **Arnulf of Carinthia**(Arnulf von Kärnten) | Carolingian | 30 November 887\n | 25 April 896\n | 8 December 899\n | Illegitimate son of Carloman\n |\n| ![](image) | Louis the Child(Ludwig IV. das Kind) | Carolingian | 21 January 900\n | —\n | 20/24 September 911\n | Son of Arnulf of Carinthia\n |\n\n\n#### Conradine dynasty[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Seal\n | Name\n | House\n | King\n | Emperor\n | Ended\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | Conrad I(Konrad I.) | Conradine (Franconian) | 10 November 911\n | —\n | 23 December 918\n | Elected by the nobility\n |\n\n\n#### Ottonian dynasty[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Seal\n | Name\n | House\n | King\n | Emperor\n | Ended\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | Henry I the Fowler(Heinrich I. der Vogler) | Liudolfing (Saxon) | 23 April 919\n | —\n | 2 July 936\n | Elected by the nobility\n |\n| ![](image) | *Arnulf the Bad*(Arnulf der Böse, Herzog von Bayern) | Luitpolding (Bavarian) | 919\n | —\n | 921\n | Rival king to Henry I\n |\n\n\n### Holy Roman Empire, 962–1806[edit]\n\n\nThe title \"King of the Romans\", used under the Holy Roman Empire, is (from this point onwards) considered equivalent to King of Germany.

The first to take the title was Odoacer, a barbarian military leader, in the late 5th century, followed by the Ostrogothic kings up to the mid-6th century. With the Frankish conquest of Italy in the 8th century, the Carolingians assumed the title, which was maintained by subsequent Holy Roman Emperors throughout the Middle Ages.

Macron is *ex officio* one of the two Co-Princes of Andorra. He previously served as Minister of Economics, Industry and Digital Affairs under President François Hollande from 2014 to 2016, and as Deputy Secretary-General to the President from 2012 to 2014. He is a founding member of Renaissance.\n\n\nBorn in Amiens, Macron studied philosophy at Paris Nanterre University, later completing a master's degree in public affairs at Sciences Po and graduating from the École nationale d'administration in 2004. He worked as a senior civil servant at the Inspectorate General of Finances and later became an investment banker at Rothschild & Co.\n\n\nAppointed Élysée deputy secretary-general by President François Hollande shortly after his election in May 2012, Macron was one of Hollande's senior advisers. Appointed Minister of Economics, Industry and Digital Affairs in August of 2014 in the second Valls government, he led a number of business-friendly reforms. He resigned in August 2016, in order to launch his 2017 presidential campaign. A member of the Socialist Party from 2006 to 2009, he ran in the election under the banner of En Marche, a centrist and pro-European political movement he founded in April 2016.\n\n\nPartly as a result of the Fillon affair which sank The Republicans nominee François Fillon's chances, Macron topped the ballot in the first round of voting, and was elected President of France on 7 May 2017 with 66.1% of the vote in the second round, defeating Marine Le Pen of the National Front. At the age of 39, he became the youngest president in French history. In the 2017 legislative election in June, his party, renamed La République En Marche! (LREM), secured a majority in the National Assembly. He appointed Édouard Philippe as prime minister. When Philippe resigned in 2020, Macron appointed Jean Castex to replace him. \n\n\nMacron was elected to a second term in the 2022 presidential election, again defeating Le Pen, thus becoming the first French presidential candidate to win reelection since Jacques Chirac defeated Jean-Marie Le Pen in 2002. However, in the 2022 legislative election, his centrist coalition lost its absolute majority, resulting in a hung parliament and the formation of France's first minority government since the fall of the Bérégovoy government in 1993. Macron's current prime minister is Élisabeth Borne, the second female head of government in French history, whom he appointed in May 2022 to replace Castex. He has reshuffled the current cabinet twice since its formation: first in July 2022, and then again in July 2023.\n\n\nDuring his presidency, Macron has overseen several reforms to labour laws, taxation, and pensions; and has pursued a renewable energy transition. Dubbed \"president of the rich\" by political opponents, increasing protests against his domestic reforms and demanding his resignation marked the first years of his presidency, culminating in 2018–2020 with the yellow vests protests and the pension reform strike. From 2020, he led France's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccination rollout. In 2023, the government of his prime minister, Élisabeth Borne, passed legislation raising the retirement age from 62 to 64; the pension reforms proved controversial and led to public sector strikes and violent protests. In foreign policy, he called for reforms to the European Union (EU) and signed bilateral treaties with Italy and Germany. Macron conducted €42 billion in trade and business agreements with China during the China–United States trade war and oversaw a dispute with Australia and the United States over the AUKUS security pact. He continued Opération Chammal in the war against the Islamic State and joined in the international condemnation of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nMacron was born on 21 December 1977 in Amiens. He is the son of Françoise Macron (née Noguès), a physician, and Jean-Michel Macron, professor of neurology at the University of Picardy.[1][2] The couple divorced in 2010. He has two siblings, Laurent, born in 1979, and Estelle, born in 1982. Françoise and Jean-Michel's first child was stillborn.[3]\n\n\nThe Macron family legacy is traced back to the village of Authie, Picardy.[4] One of his paternal great-grandfathers, George William Robertson, was English, and was born in Bristol, United Kingdom.[5][6] His maternal grandparents, Jean and Germaine Noguès (née Arribet), are from the Pyrenean town of Bagnères-de-Bigorre, Gascony.[7] He commonly visited Bagnères-de-Bigorre to visit his grandmother Germaine, whom he called \"Manette\".[8] Macron associates his enjoyment of reading[9] and his leftward political leanings to Germaine, who, after coming from a modest upbringing of a stationmaster father and a housekeeping mother, became a teacher then a principal, and died in 2013.[10]\n\n\nAlthough raised in a non-religious family, Macron was baptised a Catholic at his own request at age 12; he is agnostic today.[11]\n\n\nMacron was educated mainly at the Jesuit institute Lycée la Providence[12] in Amiens[13] before his parents sent him to finish his last year of school[14] at the elite Lycée Henri-IV in Paris, where he completed the high school curriculum and the undergraduate program with a \"Bac S, Mention Très bien\". At the same time, he was nominated for the \"Concours général\" (most selective national level high school competition) in French literature and received his diploma for his piano studies at Amiens Conservatory.[15] His parents sent him to Paris due to their alarm at the bond he had formed with Brigitte Auzière, a married teacher with three children at Jésuites de la Providence, who later became his wife.[16]\n\n\nIn Paris, Macron twice failed to gain entry to the École normale supérieure.[17][18][19] He instead studied philosophy at the University of Paris-Ouest Nanterre La Défense, obtaining a DEA degree (a master level degree), with a thesis on Machiavelli and Hegel.[12][20] Around 1999 Macron worked as an editorial assistant to Paul Ricoeur, the French Protestant philosopher who was then writing his last major work, *La Mémoire, l'Histoire, l'Oubli*. Macron worked mainly on the notes and bibliography.[21][22] Macron became a member of the editorial board of the literary magazine *Esprit*.[23]\n\n\nMacron did not perform national service because he was pursuing his graduate studies. Born in December 1977, he belonged to the last cohort for whom military service was mandatory.[24][25]\n\n\nMacron obtained a master's degree in public affairs at Sciences Po, majoring in \"Public Guidance and Economy\" before training for a senior civil service career at the selective École nationale d'administration (ENA), training at the French Embassy in Nigeria[26] and at the prefecture of Oise before graduating in 2004.[27]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Inspector of Finances[edit]\n\n\nAfter graduating from ENA in 2004, Macron became an Inspector in the *Inspection générale des finances* (IGF), a branch of the Finance Ministry.[21] Macron was mentored by Jean-Pierre Jouyet, the then-head of the IGF.[28] During his time as an Inspector of Finances, Macron gave lectures during the summer at the \"prep'ENA\" (a special cram school for the ENA entrance examination) at IPESUP, an elite private school specializing in preparation for the entrance examinations of the *Grandes écoles*, such as HEC or Sciences Po.[29][30][31]\n\n\nIn 2006, Laurence Parisot offered him the job of managing director for *Mouvement des Entreprises de France*, the largest employer federation in France, but he declined.[32]\n\n\nIn August 2007, Macron was appointed deputy rapporteur for Jacques Attali's \"Commission to Unleash French Growth\".[13] In 2008, Macron paid €50,000 to buy himself out of his government contract.[33] He then became an investment banker in a highly-paid position at Rothschild & Cie Banque.[34][35] In March 2010, he was appointed to the Attali Commission as a member.[36]\n\n\n\n### Investment banker[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2008, Macron left his job as an Inspector of Finances and took a position at Rothschild & Cie Banque.[37] Macron left the government when Nicolas Sarkozy became president. He was originally offered the job by François Henrot. His first responsibility at the bank was assisting with the acquisition of Cofidis by Crédit Mutuel Nord Europe.[38]\n\n\nMacron formed a relationship with Alain Minc, a businessman on the supervisory board of *Le Monde*.[39] In 2010, Macron was promoted to partner with the bank after working on the recapitalization of *Le Monde* and the acquisition by Atos of Siemens IT Solutions and Services.[40] In the same year, Macron was put in charge of Nestlé's acquisition of Pfizer's infant nutrition division for €9 billion, which made him a millionaire.[41][42]\n\n\nIn February 2012, he advised businessman Philippe Tillous-Borde, the CEO of the Avril Group.[43]\n\n\nMacron reported that he had earned €2 million between December 2010 and May 2012.[44] Official documents show that between 2009 and 2013, Macron had earned almost €3 million.[45] He left Rothschild & Cie in 2012.[46][47]\n\n\n\n## Political career[edit]\n\n\nIn his youth, Macron worked for the Citizen and Republican Movement for two years, but he never applied to be a member.[48][44] Macron was an assistant for Mayor Georges Sarre of the 11th arrondissement of Paris during his time at Sciences Po.[49] Macron had been a member of the Socialist Party since he was 24,[50] but last renewed his membership for the period 2006–2009.[51]\n\n\nMacron met François Hollande through Jean-Pierre Jouyet in 2006 and joined his staff in 2010.[50] In 2007, Macron attempted to run for a seat in the National Assembly in Picardy under the Socialist Party label in the 2007 legislative elections, however, his application was declined.[52] Macron was offered the chance to be the deputy chief of staff to Prime Minister François Fillon in 2010, though he declined.[53]\n\n\n\n### Deputy Secretary-General of the Élysée[edit]\n\n\nOn 15 May 2012, Macron became the deputy secretary-general of the Élysée, a senior role in President François Hollande's staff.[54][27] Macron served with Nicolas Revel. He served under the secretary-general, Pierre-René Lemas.\n\n\nDuring the summer of 2012, Macron put forward a proposal that would increase the 35-hour work week to 37 hours until 2014. He also tried to hold back the large tax increases on the highest earners that were planned by the government. Hollande refused Macron's proposals.[55] In 2013, his was one of the deciding votes against regulating the salaries of CEOs.[56] Nicolas Revel, the other deputy secretary-general of the Élysée opposed Macron on a proposed budget responsibility pact favoured by the Medef.[57]\n\n\nOn 10 June 2014, it was announced that Macron had resigned from his role and was replaced by Laurence Boone.[58] Reasons given for his departure included his disappointment at not being included in the first Government of Manuel Valls and his frustration with his lack of influence on the reforms proposed by the government.[57] This was following the appointment of Jean-Pierre Jouyet as chief of staff.[59]\n\n\nJouyet said that Macron left to \"continue personal aspirations\"[60] and create his own financial consultancy firm.[61] It was later reported that he was planning to create an investment firm that would attempt to fund educational projects.[48] Shortly afterwards he was hired as a research fellow at the University of Berlin with the help of businessman Alain Minc. He had also sought a position at Harvard University.[62]\n\n\nOffered a chance to be a candidate in the municipal elections in 2014 in his hometown of Amiens, Macron declined,[63] leading François Hollande to reject Manuel Valls idea of appointing him Budget Minister, as he had never been elected to public office.[59]\n\n\n\n### Minister of Economics and Industry[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Uber Files\n\n![](image)Macron as the French Minister of Economics and IndustryHe was appointed as the Minister of Economics and Industry in the second Valls Cabinet on 26 August 2014, replacing Arnaud Montebourg.[64] He was the youngest Minister of Economics since Valéry Giscard d'Estaing in 1962.[65] Macron was branded by the media as the \"Anti-Montebourg\" due to being pro-EU and much more moderate, while Montebourg was eurosceptic and left-wing.[66] As Minister of Economics, Macron was at the forefront of pushing through business-friendly reforms. On 17 February 2015, prime minister Manuel Valls pushed Macron's signature law package through a reluctant parliament using the special 49.3 procedure.[67]\n\n\nMacron increased the French share in the company Renault from 15% to 20% and then enforced the *Florange law* which grants double voting rights on shares registered for more than two years unless two-thirds of shareholders vote to overturn it.[68] This gave the French state a minority share in the company though Macron later stated that the government would limit its powers within Renault.[69]\n\n\nMacron was widely criticized for being unable to prevent the closing down of an Ecopla factory in Isère.[70]\n\n\nIn August 2015, Macron said that he was no longer a member of the Socialist Party and was an independent.[51]\n\n\n\n#### Macron Law[edit]\n\n\nA law which had originally been sponsored by Arnaud Montebourg before he left the government, and which had focused on \"purchasing power\", grew into the Macron law [fr], a grab bag of measures liberalizing laws prohibiting work on Sunday and at night; restrictions on coaches for public transportation; regulations for debt collectors, barristers and auctioneers; and rules governing the rental of equipment by the military from private companies. The law also sought to simplify many government procedures, such as that for obtaining a driving licence.[71][72] Manuel Valls, fearing that it would not pass in the National Assembly, decided to push the law through with the 49.3 procedure[73][67] and so it was adopted on 10 April 2015.[74]\n\n\nEstimates of the increase in GDP the law might generate ranged from 0.3% to 0.5%.[75][76]\n\n\n\n### 2017 presidential campaign[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2017 French presidential election\n\n#### Formation of En Marche and resignation from government[edit]\n\n\nMacron first became known to the French public after his appearance on the French TV programme *Des Paroles Et Des Actes* in March 2015.[77] Before forming his political party En Marche!, he gave a number of speeches, his first one in March 2015 in Val-de-Marne.[78] He threatened to leave Manuel Valls' second government over the proposed removal of dual-nationality from terrorists.[79][80] He also took various foreign trips, including one to Israel where he spoke on the advancement of digital technology.[81]\n\n\nTensions around the question of Macron's loyalty to the Valls government and Hollande increased when they turned down a bill he put forward dubbed \"Macron 2\", which had a larger scope than his original law.[82][83] Macron was given the chance to help draft into the El Khomri law and put specific parts of \"Macron 2\" into the law though El Khomri was able to overturn these with the help of other ministers.[*citation needed*][*clarification needed*]\n\n\nAmid tensions and deterioration of relations with the current government, Macron founded an independent political party, En Marche, in Amiens on 6 April 2016.[84] A liberal,[85] progressive[86][87] political movement that gathered huge media coverage when it was first established,[88] the party and Macron were both reprimanded by President Hollande and the question of Macron's loyalty to the government was raised.[89][90] Several MEPs spoke out in support for the movement[91] though the majority of the Socialist Party spoke against En Marche including Manuel Valls,[92] Michel Sapin,[93] Axelle Lemaire and Christian Eckert.[94]\n\n\nIn June 2016, support for Macron and his movement, En Marche, began to grow in the media with *Libération* reporting that *L'Express*, *Les Échos*, Le 1 [fr], and *L'Opinion* had begun to support him.[95] Following several controversies surrounding trade unionists and their protests, Acrimed [fr] reported that major newspapers began to run front-page stories about Macron and En Marche.[96] Criticized by both the far-left and the far-right, these pro-Macron influencers in the press were dubbed \"Macronites\".[97][98]\n\n\nIn May 2016, Orleans mayor Olivier Carré invited Macron to the festival commemorating the 587th anniversary of Joan of Arc's efforts during the Siege of Orléans.[99][100] LCI reported that Macron was trying to take back the symbol of Joan of Arc from the far-right. [101] Macron later went to Puy du Fou and declared he was \"not a socialist\" in a speech amid rumours he was going to leave the current government.[102]\nOn 30 August 2016, Macron resigned from the government ahead of the 2017 presidential election,[103][104] to devote himself to his En Marche movement.[105][106] There had been rising tensions and several reports that he had wanted to leave the Valls government since early 2015.[107] He initially planned to leave after the cancellation[*clarification needed*] of his \"Macron 2\" law[83] but decided to stay on temporarily after a meeting with President François Hollande.[108] Michel Sapin was announced as Macron's replacement,[109] while Hollande said he felt Macron had \"methodically betrayed\" him.[110] An IFOP poll showed that 84% of those surveyed agreed with his decision to resign.[111]\n\n\n\n#### First round of the presidential election[edit]\n\n\nMacron first showed his intention to run by forming En Marche, but following his resignation from the government, he was able to dedicate more time to his movement. He first announced that he was considering running for president in April 2016,[112] and after his resignation from the position of economy minister, media sources began to identify patterns in his fundraising indicating he would run.[113] In October 2016, Macron criticized Hollande's goal of being a \"normal\" president, saying that France needed a more \"Jupiterian presidency\".[114]\n\n\nOn 16 November 2016, Macron formally declared his candidacy for the French presidency after months of speculation. In his announcement speech, he called for a \"democratic revolution\" and promised to \"unblock France\".[115] He had expressed hope that Hollande would run several months earlier, saying that—as the sitting president—he was the legitimate Socialist party candidate.[116][117] Macron's book *Révolution* was published on 24 November 2016 and reached fifth position on the French best-seller list in December 2016.[118]\n\n\nShortly after announcing his run, Jean-Christophe Cambadélis and Manuel Valls both asked Macron to run in the Socialist Party presidential primary, which he ultimately refused to do.[119][120] Jean-Christophe Cambadélis began to threaten to exclude members who associated or supported Macron following Lyon mayor Gérard Collomb throwing his support behind him.[121]\n\n\nMacron's campaign, headed by French economist Sophie Ferracci,[122] announced in December 2016 that it had raised 3.7 million euros in donations,[123] three times the budget of then-front runner Alain Juppé.[124] Macron came under criticism from several individuals, including Benoît Hamon−who requested he reveal a list of his donors and accused him of conflicts of interest due to the time he spent at Rothschilds,[125] which Macron dismissed as \"demagogy\".[126] Journalists Marion L'Hour and Frédéric Says later reported that he had spent €120,000 on setting up dinners and meetings with various personalities within the media and in French popular culture while at Bercy.[127] Christian Jacob and Philippe Vigier accused him of using this money to campaign without campaigning.[128] His successor, Michel Sapin, saw nothing illegal about his actions, saying that he had the right to spend the funds.[129] Macron called the allegations \"defamatory\" and said that none of the ministerial budget had been spent on his party.[127]\n\n\nMacron's campaign enjoyed considerable coverage from the media.[130] Mediapart reported that over fifty magazine covers were dedicated purely to him.[131] Friends with the owners of Le Monde[132] and Claude Perdiel, the former owner of Nouvel Observateur,[133] he was labelled the \"media candidate\" by the far-left and far-right and was viewed as such in opinion polls.[134][135][136] Many observers compared his campaign to a product being sold[137] due to Maurice Lévy, a former Publicis CEO, using marketing tactics to try to advance his presidential ambitions.[138][139] The magazine *Marianne* reported that BFM TV, owned by Patrick Drahi, broadcast more coverage of Macron than of all the other main candidates combined.[140] *Marianne* speculated that this might be due to the campaigns links with Drahi through Bernard Mourad.[141][142]\n\n\nFrançois Bayrou, with whom Macron had been compared, announced he was not going to stand in the presidential election and instead formed an electoral alliance with Macron,[143][144] whose poll ratings began to rise. After several legal issues surrounding François Fillon were publicized, Macron overtook him in the polls to become the front-runner.[145][146]\n\n\nMacron attracted criticism for the time taken to spell out a formal program during his campaign; despite declaring in November that he had still not released a complete set of proposals by February, attracting both attacks from critics and concern among allies and supporters.[147] He eventually laid out his 150-page formal program on 2 March, publishing it online and discussing it at a marathon press conference that day.[148]\n\n\n\n![](image)Macron's supporters celebrating his victory at the Louvre on 7 May 2017\nMacron accumulated a wide array of supporters, securing endorsements from François Bayrou of the Democratic Movement (MoDem), MEP Daniel Cohn-Bendit, the ecologist candidate François de Rugy of the primary of the left, and Socialist MP Richard Ferrand, secretary-general of En Marche, as well as numerous others – many of them from the Socialist Party, but also a significant number of centrist and centre-right politicians.[149] The Grand Mosque of Paris urged French Muslims to vote en masse for Macron.[150]\n\n\nOn 23 April 2017, Macron received the most votes in the first round of the presidential election, with more than 8 million votes (24%) and faced Marine Le Pen in the second round, with the support of former candidates François Fillon and Benoît Hamon[151] and the sitting president François Hollande.[152]\n\n\n\n#### Second round of the presidential election[edit]\n\n\nMany foreign politicians supported Macron in his bid against right-wing populist candidate Marine Le Pen, including European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, German Chancellor Angela Merkel,[153] and former US President Barack Obama.[154]\n\n\nA debate was arranged between Macron and Le Pen on 3 May 2017. The debate lasted for two hours and opinion polls showed that he was perceived to have won.[155]\n\n\nIn March 2017, Macron's digital campaign manager, Mounir Mahjoubi, told Britain's Sky News that Russia is behind \"high level attacks\" on Macron, and said that its state media are \"the first source of false information\". He said: \"We are accusing RT (formerly known as Russia Today) and Sputnik News (of being) the first source of false information shared about our candidate ...\".[156]\n\n\nTwo days before the French presidential election on 7 May, it was reported that nine gigabytes of Macron's campaign emails had been anonymously posted to Pastebin, a document-sharing site. These documents were then spread onto the imageboard 4chan, which led to the hashtag \"#macronleaks\" trending on Twitter.[157][158] In a statement the same evening, Macron's political movement, En Marche, said: \"The En Marche movement has been the victim of a massive and coordinated hack this evening which has given rise to the diffusion on social media of various internal information\".[159] Macron's campaign had previously been presented a report in March 2017 by the Japanese cyber security firm Trend Micro detailing how En Marche had been the target of phishing attacks.[160] Trend Micro said that the group conducting these attacks was the Russian hacking group Fancy Bear, also accused of hacking the Democratic National Committee on 22 July 2016.[160] 21,075 verified emails and another 50,773 emails it could not verify were released in July 2017 by WikiLeaks.[161] This followed Le Pen accusing Macron of tax avoidance.[162]\n\n\nOn 7 May 2017, Macron was elected President of France with 66.1% of the vote to Marine Le Pen's 33.9%. The election had record abstention at 25.4%, and 8% of ballots were blank or spoiled.[163] Macron resigned from his role as president of En Marche[164] and Catherine Barbaroux became interim leader.[165]\n\n\n\n## President of France[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Presidency of Emmanuel Macron\n\n### First term[edit]\n\n\nMacron qualified for the runoff after the first round of the election on 23 April 2017. He won the second round of the presidential election on 7 May 2017 by a landslide according to preliminary results,[166] making the candidate of the National Front, Marine Le Pen, concede.[167] At 39, he became the youngest president in French history and the youngest French head of state since Napoleon.[168][169] He is also the first president of France born after the establishment of the Fifth Republic in 1958.\n\n\nMacron formally became president on 14 May.[170] He appointed Patrick Strzoda as his chief of staff[171] and Ismaël Emelien as his special advisor for strategy, communication and speeches.[172] On 15 May, he appointed Édouard Philippe of the Republicans as Prime Minister.[173][174] On the same day, he made his first official foreign visit, meeting in Berlin with Angela Merkel, the Chancellor of Germany. The two leaders emphasised the importance of France–Germany relations to the European Union.[175] They agreed to draw up a \"common road map\" for Europe, insisting that neither was against changes to the Treaties of the European Union.[176]\n\n\nIn the 2017 legislative election, Macron's party La République En Marche and its Democratic Movement allies secured a comfortable majority, winning 350 seats out of 577.[177] After The Republicans emerged as the winners of the Senate elections, government spokesman Christophe Castaner stated the elections were a \"failure\" for his party.[178]\n\n\nOn 3 July 2020, Macron appointed the centre-right Jean Castex as the Prime Minister of France. Castex, described as a social conservative, was a member of The Republicans.[179] The appointment was described as \"doubling down on a course that is widely seen as centre-right in economic terms\".[180]\n\n\n\n### Domestic policy[edit]\n\n\nIn his first few months as president, Macron pressed for the enactment of a package of reforms on public ethics, labour laws, taxes, and law enforcement agency powers.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n#### Anti-corruption[edit]\n\n\nIn response to Penelopegate, the National Assembly passed a part of Macron's proposed law to stop mass corruption in French politics by July 2017, banning elected representatives from hiring family members.[181] Meanwhile, the second part of the law scrapping a constituency fund was scheduled for voting after Senate objections.[182]\n\n\nMacron's plan to give his wife an official role within government came under fire with criticisms ranging from its being undemocratic to what critics perceive as a contradiction to his fight against nepotism.[183] Following an online petition of nearly 290,000 signatures on change.org Macron abandoned the plan.[184] On 9 August, the National Assembly adopted the bill on public ethics, a key theme of Macron's campaign, after debates on the scrapping the constituency funds.[185]\n\n\n\n#### Labour policy and unions[edit]\n\n\nMacron aims to shift union-management relations away from the adversarial lines of the current French system and toward a more flexible, consensus-driven system modelled after Germany and Scandinavia.[186][187] He has also pledged to act against companies employing cheaper labour from eastern Europe and in return affecting jobs of French workers, what he has termed as \"social dumping\". Under the Posted Workers Directive 1996, eastern European workers can be employed for a limited time at the salary level in eastern European countries, which has led to dispute between the EU states.[188]\n\n\nThe French government announced the proposed changes to France's labour rules (\"Code du Travail\"), being among the first steps taken by Macron and his government to galvanize the French economy.[189] Macron's reform efforts have encountered resistance from some French trade unions.[190] The largest trade union, the CFDT, has taken a conciliatory approach to Macron's push and has engaged in negotiations with the president, while the more militant CGT is more hostile to reforms.[186][187] Macron's labour minister, Muriel Pénicaud, is overseeing the effort.[191]\n\n\nThe National Assembly including the Senate approved the proposal, allowing the government to loosen the labour laws after negotiations with unions and employers' groups.[192] The reforms, which were discussed with unions, limit payouts for dismissals deemed unfair and give companies greater freedom to hire and fire employees as well as to define acceptable working conditions. The president signed five decrees reforming the labour rules on 22 September.[193] Government figures released in October 2017 revealed that during the legislative push to reform the labour code, the unemployment rate had dropped 1.8%, the biggest since 2001.[194]\n\n\n\n#### Migrant crisis[edit]\n\n\nSpeaking on refugees and, specifically, the Calais Jungle, Macron said on 16 January 2018 that he would not allow another refugee camp to form in Paris before outlining the government policy towards immigration and asylum.[195] He has also announced plans to speed up asylum applications and deportations but give refugees better housing.[196]\n\n\nOn 23 June 2018, President Macron said: \"The reality is that Europe is not experiencing a migration crisis of the same magnitude as the one it experienced in 2015\", \"a country like Italy has not at all the same migratory pressure as last year. The crisis we are experiencing today in Europe is a political crisis\".[197] In November 2019, Macron introduced new immigration rules to restrict the number of refugees reaching France, while stating to \"take back control\" of the immigration policy.[198]\n\n\n\n#### Economic policy[edit]\n\n\nPierre de Villiers, then-Chief of the General Staff of the Armies, stepped down on 19 July 2017 following a confrontation with Macron.[199] De Villiers cited the military budget cut of €850 million as the main reason he was stepping down. *Le Monde* later reported that De Villiers told a parliamentary group, \"I will not let myself be fucked like this.\"[200] Macron named François Lecointre as De Villiers' replacement.[201]\n\n\nMacron's government presented its first budget on 27 September, the terms of which reduced taxes as well as spending to bring the public deficit in line with the EU's fiscal rules.[202] The budget replaced the wealth tax with one targeting real estate, fulfilling Macron's campaign pledge to scrap the wealth tax.[203] Before it was replaced, the tax collected up to 1.5% of the wealth of French residents whose global worth exceeded €1.3m.[204]\n\n\nIn February 2018, Macron announced a plan to offer voluntary redundancy in an attempt to further cut jobs from the French civil service.[205]\n\n\nIn December 2019, Macron announced that he would scrap the 20th-century pension system and introduce a single national pension system managed by the state.[206] In January 2020, after weeks of public transport shutdown and vandalism across Paris against the new pension plan, Macron compromised on the plan by revising the retirement age.[207] In February, the pension overhaul was adopted by decree using Article 49 of the French constitution.[208] However, on 16 March 2020, Macron announced that the draft legislation would be pulled as France went into lockdown to slow the spread of COVID-19.[209]\n\n\n\n#### Terrorism[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2017, the Senate approved its first reading of a controversial bill with stricter anti-terror laws, a campaign pledge of Macron. The National Assembly voted on 3 October to pass t\nbill 415–127, with 19 abstentions. Interior Minister Gérard Collomb described France as being \"still in a state of war\" ahead of the vote, with the 1 October Marseille stabbing having taken place two days prior. The Senate then passed the bill on its second reading by a 244–22 margin on 18 October. Later that day Macron stated that 13 terror plots had been foiled since early 2017. The law replaced the state of emergency in France and made some of its provisions permanent.[210]\n\n\nThe bill was criticized by human rights advocates. A public poll by *Le Figaro* showed 57% of the respondents approved of it even though 62% thought it would encroach on personal freedoms.[211]\n\n\nThe law gives authorities expanded power to search homes, restrict movement, close places of worship,[212] and search areas around train stations and international ports and airports. It was passed after modifications to address concerns about civil liberties. The most punitive measures will be reviewed annually and were scheduled to lapse by the end of 2020.[213] The bill was signed into law by Macron on 30 October 2017. He announced that starting 1 November, it would bring an end to the state of emergency.[214]\n\n\n\n#### Civil rights[edit]\n\n\nVisiting Corsica in February 2018, Macron sparked controversy when he rejected Corsican nationalist wishes for Corsican as an official language[215] but offered to recognize Corsica in the French constitution.[216]\n\n\nMacron also proposed a plan to \"reorganise\" the Islamic religion in France saying: \"We are working on the structuring of Islam in France and also on how to explain it, which is extremely important – my goal is to rediscover what lies at the heart of *laïcité*, the possibility of being able to believe as not to believe, in order to preserve national cohesion and the possibility of having free consciousness.\" He declined to reveal further information about the plan.[217]\n\n\n\n#### Foreign policy and national defence[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Macron at the 2018 G7 summit in Charlevoix, Quebec\n![](image)Macron shakes hands with US President Donald Trump in September 2018\n![](image)Macron with US President Joe Biden at the G20 summit in October 2021\n![](image)Macron and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi in 2021, following the signing of the Quirinal Treaty\n![](image)Macron, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Kyiv in 2022\nMacron attended the 2017 Brussels summit on 25 May 2017, his first NATO summit as president of France. At the summit, he met US President Donald Trump for the first time. The meeting was widely publicized due to a handshake between the two of them, characterized as a \"power-struggle\".[218][219]\n\n\nOn 29 May 2017, Macron met with Vladimir Putin at the Palace of Versailles. The meeting sparked controversy when Macron denounced Russia Today and Sputnik, accusing the news agencies of being \"organs of influence and propaganda, of lying propaganda\".[220][221] Macron also urged cooperation in the conflict against ISIS and warned that France would respond with force in Syria if chemical weapons were used.[222] In response to the chemical attack in Douma, Syria in 2018, Macron directed French participation in airstrikes against Syrian government sites, coordinated with the United States and the United Kingdom.[223][224]\n\n\nIn his first major foreign policy speech on 29 August, President Macron stated that fighting Islamist terrorism at home and abroad was France's top priority. Macron urged a tough international stance to pressure North Korea into negotiations, on the same day it fired a missile over Japan. He also affirmed his support for the Iranian nuclear deal and criticized Venezuela's government as a \"dictatorship\". He added that he would announce his new initiatives on the future of the European Union after the German elections in September.[225] At the 56th Munich Security Conference in February, Macron presented his 10-year vision policy to strengthen the European Union. Macron remarked that larger budget, integrated capital markets, effective defence policy and quick decision-making held the key for Europe. He added that reliance on NATO and especially the US and the UK was not good for Europe, and a dialogue must be established with Russia.[226]\n\n\nPrior to the 45th G7 summit in Biarritz, France, Macron hosted Vladimir Putin at the Fort de Brégançon, stating that \"Russia fully belongs within a Europe of values.\"[227] At the summit itself, Macron was invited to attend on the margins by Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif.[*clarification needed*] Macron, who \"attempted a high-risk diplomatic gambit\", thought that the Foreign Minister of Iran might be able to defuse the tense situation over the Iranian nuclear programme in spite of the recent uptick in tensions between the Islamic Republic and the United States and Britain.[228]\n\n\nIn March 2019, at a time when China–U.S. economic relations were troubled with a trade war underway, Macron and Chinese leader Xi Jinping signed a series of 15 large-scale trade and business agreements totaling 40 billion euros ($45 billion USD) which covered many sectors over a period of years.[229] This included a €30 billion purchase of airplanes from Airbus. Going beyond aviation, the new trade agreement covered French exports of chicken, a French-built offshore wind farm in China, a Franco-Chinese cooperation fund, as well as billions of Euros of co-financing between BNP Paribas and the Bank of China. Other plans included billions of euros to be spent on modernizing Chinese factories, as well as new ship building.[230]\n\n\nIn July 2020, Macron called for sanctions against Turkey for violating Greece's and Cyprus' sovereignty, saying it is \"not acceptable that the maritime space of (EU) member states be violated and threatened.\"[231] He also criticized Turkish military intervention in Libya.[232][233] Macron said that \"We have the right to expect more from Turkey than from Russia, given that it is a member of NATO.\"[234]\n\n\nIn 2021, Macron was reported as saying Northern Ireland was not truly part of the United Kingdom following disputes with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson over implementations of the Northern Ireland protocol.[235] He later denied this, saying he was referring to the fact that Great Britain is separated from Northern Ireland by sea in reference to the Irish Sea border.[236][237]\n\n\nFrench-U.S. relations became tense in September 2021 due to fallout from the AUKUS security pact between the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. The security pact is directed at countering Chinese power in the Indo-Pacific region. As part of the agreement, the U.S. agreed to provide nuclear-powered submarines to Australia. After entering into AUKUS, the Australian government canceled an agreement that it had made with France for the provision of French conventionally powered submarines, angering the French government.[238] On 17 September, France recalled its ambassadors from Australia and the US for consultations.[239] Despite tension in the past, France had never before withdrawn its ambassador to the United States.[240] After a call between Macron and U.S. President Joe Biden on request from the latter, the two leaders agreed to reduce bilateral tensions, and the White House acknowledged the crisis could have been averted if there had been open consultations between allies.[241][242][*unreliable source?*]\n\n\nOn 26 November 2021, Macron and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi signed the Quirinal Treaty at the Quirinal Palace in Rome.[243] The treaty aimed to promote the convergence and coordination of French and Italian positions in matters of European and foreign policies, security and defence, migration policy, economy, education, research, culture and cross-border cooperation.[244]\n\n\nDuring the prelude to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Macron spoke face-to-face and on the phone to Russian President Vladimir Putin.[245] During Macron's campaign for the re-election, nearly two months after the Russian invasion began, Macron called on European leaders to maintain dialogue with Putin.[246]\n\n\n\n#### Approval ratings[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Opinion polling on the Emmanuel Macron presidency\n\nSee also: Protests against Emmanuel Macron\n\n![](image)Approval and disapproval ratings of Macron\nAccording to an IFOP poll for *Le Journal du Dimanche*, Macron started his five-year term with a 62% approval rating,[247][248] which rose to 64% by 24 June.[249] One month later, Macron suffered a 10% point drop in popularity, the largest at the beginning of a term for any president since Jacques Chirac in 1995, and by August, his popularity had fallen off 24 percentage points since June.[250] This was attributed to his recent confrontations with former Chief of Defence Staff Pierre de Villiers,[251] the nationalization of the Chantiers de l'Atlantique shipyard owned by the bankrupt STX Offshore & Shipbuilding,[252] and a reduction in housing benefits.[253]\n\n\nBy the end of September 2017, seven out of ten respondents said that they believed Emmanuel Macron was respecting his campaign promises,[254][255] though a majority felt that the policies the government was putting forward were \"unfair\".[256] Macron's popularity fell sharply again in 2018, reaching about 25% by the end of November during the yellow vests movement.[257][*unreliable source?*] During the COVID-19 pandemic in France, his popularity increased, reaching 50% at its highest in July 2020.[258][259]\n\n\n\n#### Benalla affair[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Benalla affair\n\nOn 18 July 2018, *Le Monde* revealed in an article that a member of Macron's staff Alexandre Benalla posed as a police officer and beat a protester during May Day demonstrations in Paris earlier in the year and was suspended for a period of 15 days before only being internally demoted. The Élysée failed to refer the case to the public prosecutor and a preliminary investigation into the case was not opened until the day after the publication of the article, and the lenient penalty served by Benalla raised questions within the opposition about whether the executive deliberately chose not to inform the public prosecutor as required under the code of criminal procedure.[260]\n\n\n\n### 2022 presidential campaign[edit]\n\n\nIn the 2022 election, Macron was the first incumbent to be re-elected since Jacques Chirac defeated Jean-Marie Le Pen in the 2002 election.[261] Macron again defeated Marine Le Pen in the runoff, this time by a closer margin, with 58.55% of the votes to Le Pen's 41.45%.[262] Due to near-record abstentions, this represented 38.52% of registered voters, the lowest figure since Georges Pompidou's 37.5% in 1969.[263] The French far-right received their highest vote total since the start of the French Republic, with nationalist candidates (Le Pen, Zemmour and Dupont-Aignan) winning 32.3% of the votes in the first round and Le Pen achieving a record 41.5% of the votes in the second round.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Second term[edit]\n\n\nThough Macron's second inauguration took place on 7 May 2022, his second presidential term officially began on 14 May 2022. \n\n\n\n#### New government[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Borne government\n\nOn 16 May 2022, Prime Minister Jean Castex resigned after 22 months as head of government. The same day, President Macron appointed Élisabeth Borne at the Hôtel Matignon, thus making her the second female PM in French history after Édith Cresson between 1991 and 1992. She then formed a new government on 20 May 2022.\n\n\n\n### June 2022 legislative election[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2022 French legislative elections and July 2022 French government reshuffle\n\nIn June 2022, one month into his second term, less than two weeks before the end of the French presidency of the Council of the EU and days after he called for voters to hand him a \"solid majority\" in a controversial 'tarmac speech',[264] Macron lost his parliamentary majority and was returned a hung parliament in the second round of the 2022 legislative election:[265] Macron's presidential coalition, which had a 115-seat majority going into the election, failed to reach the threshold of 289 seats needed to command an overall majority in the National Assembly, retaining only 251 out of the 346 it had held in the previous Assembly, and falling 38 short of an absolute majority.[266] Crucially, three close political allies to President Macron were defeated in the elections: incumbent President of the National Assembly Richard Ferrand, Macron's own LREM parliamentary party leader Christophe Castaner and MoDem parliamentary group leader Patrick Mignola, thus effectively \"decapitating\" Macron's parliamentary bloc leadership and further weakening the President's political position in hung parliament territory.[267]\n\n\n\n![](image)16th National Assembly of France, elected in 2022, is France's current legislature.\nThree government ministers resigned after losing their seats: Justine Bénin (junior minister for the Sea), Brigitte Bourguignon (Minister for Health and Prevention) and Amélie de Montchalin (Minister for Ecological Transition).[268]\n\n\nMacron's government, still led by Prime Minister Élisabeth Borne, was reshuffled in early July 2022 and continued as a minority administration, after talks with opposition leaders to form a stable majority government failed.[269]\n\n\n\n### Domestic affairs[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2023 French pension reform strikes, Motions of no confidence in the government of Élisabeth Borne (2023), Nahel Merzouk riots, and 2023 French government reshuffle\n\nMacron's second presidential term began with two significant political controversies. Hours after the new Borne cabinet was announced, rape accusations against newly-appointed Minister for Solidarity Damien Abad were made public,[270] and on 28 May, the handling of the 2022 UEFA Champions League final chaos at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis drew criticism at home and abroad.[271]\n\n\nDespite its minority status in the legislature after the 2022 legislative election, Macron's government passed bills to ease the cost-of-living crisis,[272] to repeal the COVID-era \"state of health emergency\",[273] and to revive the French nuclear energy sector.[274] However, government proposals were defeated several times in the National Assembly[275] and by the end of 2022, the Borne cabinet had had to use the provisions of Article 49.3 of the Constitution ten times in a row to pass the 2023 Government Budget and Social Security Budget.[276]\n\n\n\n#### Pension reform[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2023, Macron's government passed a law raising the retirement age from 62 to 64, partly bypassing Parliament by again resorting to Article 49.3 to break the parliamentary deadlock.[277]\nNationwide protests that had begun when the bill was introduced back in January increased in intensity after the reform was passed without a solemn vote.[*citation needed*][*clarification needed*]\n\n\n\n#### Votes of no-confidence in the Borne government[edit]\n\n\nOn 20 March 2023, Macron's cabinet, headed by Prime minister Borne, survived a cross-party motion of no-confidence by only nine votes, the slimmest margin for such a vote since 1992.[278]\n\n\nOn 12 June 2023, his government survived its 17th no-confidence motion since the beginning of the 16th legislature; the motion, brought by the left-wing NUPES coalition, fell 50 votes short of the 289 votes needed.[279]\n\n\n\n#### Nahel Merzouk riots[edit]\n\n\nIn early summer 2023, French authorities faced riots following the killing of Nahel M., aged 17, by a police officer during a traffic stop. [280][281] To calm widespread unrest, comparable in intensity to the 2005 French riots[*citation needed*], Macron's administration ramped up government response, with a total of 45,000 police officers deployed on the ground and a ministerial order advising courts to apply harsher sentences and accelerated procedures:[282] this crackdown resulted in over 1,300 arrests on the fourth night of unrest alone, bringing the total number of arrests since the riots' beginning to over 2,000 as of 1 July.[283]\n\n\n\n#### 2023 government reshuffle[edit]\n\n\nOn 20 July 2023, Macron carried out a government reshuffle at the end of the \"hundred days of appeasement and action\" he called for in April 2023 following the violent protests surrounding the passage of his pension system reform. Pap Ndiaye and Marlène Schiappa were sacked as part of the reshuffle.[284]\n\n\n\n#### Defence policy[edit]\n\n\nOn 1 August 2023, Macron signed into law a multi-year military planning bill, which set the stage for a 40%-increase in military spending to a total of €413 billion between 2024 and 2030, after it was passed by the French parliament on 13 July 2023.[285][286]\n\n\n\n#### Immigration policy[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2023, Macron's government introduced an immigration & asylum bill aimed at removing deportation safeguards, fast-tracking asylum application process and immigration litigation, while also facilitating legalization of undocumented workers.[287] His government later pulled the draft legislation amid fears of defeat in Parliament, instead planning to hold talks with centre-right LR party before re-introducing the bill in the autumn.[288]\n\n\nIn August 2023, in a lengthy interview to weekly magazine Le Point, Macron said that France \"must significantly reduce immigration, starting with illegal immigration\" because the \"current situation is not sustainable\".[289]\n\n\n\n#### Constitutional reform[edit]\n\n\nOn the 65th anniversary of the French Constitution on 4 October 2023, Macron unveiled avenues for constitutional reform: broadening the scope and relaxing rules for referendums; enshrining the right to abortion and climate protection in the Constitution; stepping up the level of territorial devolution; giving some form of political autonomy to Corsica and New Caledonia.[290]\n\n\nIf it was to materialize, it would be Macron's first constitutional reform since taking office in 2017 since his previous attempts failed in Parliament.\n\n\n\n### External affairs[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Macron with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni in October 2022\n![](image)Macron, Ursula von der Leyen and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the 2023 France–China Summit\nOn 16 June 2022, Macron visited Ukraine alongside German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italy's Prime Minister Mario Draghi. He met with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and expressed \"European Unity\" for Ukraine.[291][292] He said that the nations that remained neutral in the Russo-Ukrainian War made a historic mistake and were complicit in the new imperialism.[293]\n\n\n\n![](image)Macron with Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in May 2023\nIn September 2022, Macron criticized the United States, Norway and other \"friendly\" natural gas supplier states for the extremely high prices of their supplies,[294] saying in October 2022 that Europeans are \"paying four times more than the price you sell to your industry. That is not exactly the meaning of friendship.\"[295]\n\n\nMacron and his wife attended the state funeral of Queen Elizabeth II in Westminster Abbey, London, on 19 September 2022.\n\n\nOn 23 October 2022, Macron became the first foreign leader to meet new Italian President of the Council Giorgia Meloni, just a day after she and her ministers were sworn into office.[296]\n\n\nDuring a summit to China with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, which included a formal meeting with Xi Jinping, the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and President of China, Macron called for Europe to reduce its dependence on the United States in general and to stay neutral and avoid being drawn into any possible confrontation between the U.S. and China over Taiwan. Speaking after a three-day state visit to China, Macron emphasised his theory of strategic autonomy, suggesting that Europe could become a \"third superpower\". He argued that Europe should focus on boosting its own defence industries and additionally reduce its dependence on the United States dollar (USD).[297] in a follow-up speech in The Hague to further outline his vision of strategic autonomy for Europe.[298] On 7 June 2023, a report by the pan-European think tank European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) found that most Europeans agree with Macron's views on China and the United States.[299]\n\n\nIn February 2023, he welcomed Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed in Paris to normalize relations between France and Ethiopia, strained by the Tigray War between the Ethiopian government and Tigray rebels.[300]\n\n\n\n![](image)Macron at the NATO Summit in Vilnius on 12 July 2023\nOn 31 May 2023 Macron visited the GLOBSEC forum in Bratislava, where he again delivered a speech on European sovereignty.[301] During the question and answer session that followed the Bratislava speech,[302] he said that negotiating with Putin may have to take priority over any war crimes tribunal which some others, including Zelensky, wish to see.[303]\n\n\nOn 12 June 2023, Macron promised to deliver more ammunition, weapons and armed vehicles to help Ukrainian forces with the ongoing counter-offensive to liberate Russian-occupied southeastern Ukraine.[304] At the NATO Summit in Vilnius, he promised to supply Ukraine with Scalp long-range cruise missiles to hit Russian targets deep behind the front lines.[305] On 10 November 2023, he said that what Russia is doing in Ukraine is \"imperialism and colonialism\" and it was the \"duty\" of France and other countries to help Ukraine defend itself, but added that maybe the time will come to hold fair peace negotiations and find a solution with Russia.[306]\n\n\n\n![](image)Macron with Israeli President Isaac Herzog in Jerusalem, Israel, 24 October 2023\nIn June 2023 Macron hosted a global climate finance conference described by many as the new Bretton Woods Conference. The purpose is to adjust the global economy to the contemporary threats of climate change and hunger. One of the proposition is to offer to low income countries help instead of credits so they can use their resource for stopping climate change and poverty instead of debt payments. Macron supported the idea, but a climate activist from Uganda remarked that the promises were meaningless if at the same time Makron supported projects like the East African Crude Oil Pipeline, a major threat to the climate and to the drinking water of 40 million people.[307] At the summit Macron proposed an international taxation system and debt restructuring but stressed it can have an effect only with international cooperation.[308]\n\n\nIn July 2023, Macron postponed his planned state visit to Germany due to the ongoing Nahel M. riots.[309]\n\n\nIn October 2023, Macron condemned Hamas' actions during the Israel–Hamas war and expressed his support to Israel and its right to self-defense.[310][311] He criticized Iran for its support of Hamas.[312] On 24 October, Macron visited Israel to express solidarity with the country. He said that the anti-ISIL coalition should also fight against Hamas.[313] On 10 November 2023, he called for a ceasefire and urged Israel to stop bombing Gaza and killing civilians.[314]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\n### Uber Files[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Uber Files\n\nOn 10 July 2022, *The Guardian* revealed that Macron had assisted Uber in lobbying during his term as the Minister of Economics and Industry,[315] leading to calls from opposition lawmakers for a parliamentary inquiry.[316][317] In his own defence, Macron expressed that he \"did his job\" and that he would \"do it again tomorrow and the day after tomorrow\".[317] He stated, \"I'm proud of it\".[317]\n\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Political positions of Emmanuel Macron\n\n## Co-prince of Andorra[edit]\n\n\nAs president of France, Macron also serves *ex officio* as one of the two co-princes of Andorra. His chief of staff Patrick Strzoda serves as his representative in this capacity. Joan Enric Vives i Sicília, appointed as the current Bishop of Urgell on 12 May 2003, serves as Macron's co-prince. Macron swore the Constitution of Andorra through Strzoda in an act that took place on 15 June 2017 in Casa de la Vall.[318]\n\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the Andorran government asked France for economic aid, but Macron refused, arguing that the Bank of France could not offer loans to another country without the approval of the European Central Bank.[319]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte Trogneux in 2017\nMacron is married to Brigitte Trogneux,[320] 24 years his senior,[321] and his former La Providence high school teacher in Amiens.[322][323] They met during a theatre workshop that she was giving when he was a 15-year-old student and she was a 39-year-old teacher.[324][325] His parents initially attempted to separate the couple by sending him away to Paris to finish the final year of his schooling, as they felt his youth made this relationship inappropriate.[14][325] The couple reunited after Macron graduated, and were married in 2007.[325] She has three children from a previous marriage; he has no children of his own.[326][*unreliable source?*] Trogneux's role in Macron's 2017 presidential campaign has been considered pivotal, with close Macron allies stating that Trogneux helped Macron to develop skills like public speaking.[327]\n\n\nHis best man was Henry Hermand (1924–2016), a businessman who loaned €550,000 to Macron for the purchase of his first apartment in Paris when he was Inspector of Finances. Hermand also let Macron use some of his offices on the Avenue des Champs Élysées in Paris for his movement En Marche.[328][329]\n\n\nIn the 2002 French presidential election, Macron voted for souverainist Jean-Pierre Chevènement.[330] In 2007, Macron voted for Ségolène Royal in the second round of the presidential election.[331] During the Socialist Party primary in 2011, Macron voiced his support for François Hollande.[332]\n\n\nMacron plays the piano,[333] and studied piano for ten years in his youth.[15] He especially enjoys the work of Robert Schumann and Franz Liszt.[334][335] Macron also skis,[336] plays tennis[337] and enjoys boxing.[338] In addition to his native French, Macron speaks fluent English.[339][340]\n\n\nIn August 2017, a photojournalist was arrested and detained by the police for six hours after he entered the private residence where Macron was vacationing in Marseille.[341] Macron subsequently filed a complaint for \"harassment\".[341] In September 2017, he dropped the complaint \"as a gesture of appeasement\".[342]\n\n\nOn 27 August 2017, Macron and his wife Brigitte adopted Nemo, a black Labrador Retriever-Griffon dog who lives with them in the Élysée Palace.[343] As a schoolboy, Macron decided to be baptized as a Catholic. In June 2018, prior to meeting Pope Francis, he identified himself as an agnostic Catholic.[344][345] In the same year he agreed to become an honorary canon of St John Lateran, the cathedral of Rome.[345]\n\n\n\n![](image)Macron celebrating France's victory over Croatia in the 2018 World Cup final in Moscow, Russia\nA fan of football, Macron is a supporter of French club Olympique de Marseille.[346] During the 2018 World Cup, he attended the semi-final between France and Belgium with the Belgian King Philippe and Queen Mathilde,[347] and at the World Cup final against Croatia, he sat and celebrated alongside Croatian president Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović. Macron received widespread media attention for his celebrations and his interactions with the Croatian president.[348][349][350][351][352]\n\n\nOn 17 December 2020, Macron tested positive for COVID-19[353] leading to the cancellation of his scheduled trips for the following month, including a visit to Lebanon.[354]\n\n\n\n## Honours and decorations[edit]\n\n\n### National honours[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Ribbon bar | Honour | Date and comment\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | Grand Master & Grand Cross of the National Order of the Legion of Honour | 14 May 2017 – automatic upon taking presidential office\n |\n| ![](image) | Grand Master & Grand Cross of the National Order of Merit | 14 May 2017 – automatic upon taking presidential office\n |\n\n\n### Foreign honours[edit]\n\n\n#### As President of the French Republic[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Ribbon bar | Country | Honour | Date\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) Netherlands | Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Netherlands Lion | 11 April 2023[355][356] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) United Arab Emirates | Collar of the Order of Zayed | 18 July 2022[357] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) Italy | Knight Grand Cross with Collar of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic | 1 July 2021[358] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) United States | Chief Commander of the Legion of Merit | 8 December 2020[359][*failed verification*] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) Egypt | Collar of the Order of the Nile | 7 December 2020[360] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) Ivory Coast | Grand Cross of the National Order of the Ivory Coast | 20 December 2019[359] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) Belgium | Grand Cordon of the Order of Leopold | 19 November 2018[359] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) South Korea | Grand Order of Mugunghwa | 8 October 2018[361] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) Finland | Grand Cross of the Order of the White Rose with Collar | 29 August 2018[362] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) Denmark | Knight of the Order of the Elephant | 28 August 2018[363] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) Luxembourg | Knight of the Order of the Gold Lion of the House of Nassau | 19 March 2018[359] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) Senegal | Grand Cross of the National Order of the Lion | 2 February 2018[359] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) Tunisia | Grand Cordon of the Order of the Republic of Tunisia | 31 January 2018[364] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) Lebanon | Grand Cross of the Order of Merit | 22 September 2017[359] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) Greece | Grand Cross of the Order of the Redeemer | 7 September 2017[365] |\n\n\n#### Prior to his presidency[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Ribbon bar | Country | Honour | Date\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) Mexico | Sash of the Order of the Aztec Eagle | 22 September 2016[366] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) United Kingdom | Honorary Commander of the Order of the British Empire | 5 June 2014[367] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) Brazil | Grand Officer of the Order of the Southern Cross | 9 December 2012[368] |\n\n\n## Prizes[edit]\n\n\n* *Le Trombinoscope* (2014, 2016)\n* Charlemagne Prize (2018)\n* Champion of the Earth (2018)\n* Westfälischer Friedenspreis [de] (2024)[369]\n\n\n## Publications[edit]\n\n\n* Macron, Emmanuel; Goldberg, Jonathan; Scott, Juliette (2017). *Revolution*.

Steinmeier was chairman-in-office of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) in 2016.\n\n\nSteinmeier is a member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), holds a doctorate in law and was formerly a career civil servant. He was a close aide of Gerhard Schröder when Schröder was Prime Minister of Lower Saxony during most of the 1990s, and served as Schröder's chief of staff from 1996. When Schröder became Chancellor of Germany in 1998, Steinmeier was appointed Under-Secretary of State in the German Chancellery with the responsibility for the intelligence services. From 1999 to 2005 he served as Chief of Staff of the Chancellery.\n\n\nFollowing the 2005 federal election, Steinmeier became Foreign Minister in the first grand coalition government of Angela Merkel, and from 2007 he additionally held the office of vice chancellor. In 2008, he briefly served as acting chairman of his party. He was the SPD's candidate for chancellor in the 2009 federal election, but his party lost the election and he left the federal cabinet to become leader of the opposition. Following the 2013 federal election, he again became Minister for Foreign Affairs in Merkel's second grand coalition. In November 2016 he was announced as the candidate for President of Germany of the governing coalition, consisting of his own party and the CDU/CSU, and thus became the presumptive electee, as the coalition held a large majority in the Federal Convention. He left the cabinet on 27 January 2017.[3] He was elected president by the Federal Convention on 12 February 2017 with 74% of the vote. On 13 February 2022, he was re-elected by the Federal Convention for a second and final term with 78% of the vote.[4]\n\n\nSteinmeier belongs to the right wing of the SPD, known as reformists and moderates.[5] As chief of staff, he was a principal architect of Agenda 2010, the Schröder government's reforms of the welfare state.[6] His lenient policies toward countries such as Russia and China have earned him criticism both in Germany and internationally, and he has been criticized for prioritizing German business interests over human rights.[7][8]\n\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nSteinmeier was born in 1956 in Detmold.[9] Although his full name is Frank-Walter, his friends call him Frank.[10] His father, a carpenter, was affiliated with the Church of Lippe (one of Germany's few Calvinist regional church bodies, and a member church of the Protestant Church of Germany). His mother, born in Breslau (now Wrocław, Poland), came as a refugee from a Lutheran part of Silesia during the flight and expulsion of Germans after World War II.[11]\n\n\nFollowing his *Abitur*, Steinmeier did his military service from 1974 to 1976, then studied law and political science at the Justus Liebig University Giessen, where Brigitte Zypries was a fellow student.[12] In 1982 he passed his first and in 1986 his second state examination in law. Steinmeier worked as a scientific assistant to the professor of public law and political science at Giessen University until he obtained his doctorate of law in 1991. His dissertation explored the state's role in preventing homelessness.[13]\n\n\n\n### Family life[edit]\n\n\nSteinmeier is married and has one daughter. On 24 August 2010, he donated a kidney to his wife, Elke Büdenbender.[14]\n\n\nIn 2015, Steinmeier served as best man at the wedding of Rüdiger Grube and Cornelia Poletto in Hamburg.[15]\n\n\n\n### Interests[edit]\n\n\nSteinmeier enjoys jazz, and is an avid football fan.[16]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nSteinmeier is a Reformed Protestant and an active member of the Reformed Bethlehem congregation in Berlin-Neukölln.[17] He was baptized into his father's church (the Church of Lippe) as a youth.\n\n\n\n### Early career[edit]\n\n\nSteinmeier became an adviser in 1991 for Law of Communication media and media guidelines in the State Chancellery of Lower Saxony in Hanover. In 1993, he became director of the Personal Office for the prime minister of Lower Saxony, Gerhard Schröder. In 1996, he became the Secretary of State and head of the State Chancellery of Lower Saxony.\n\n\n\n## Political career on federal level[edit]\n\n\n### Schröder Federal Chancellery, 1998–2005[edit]\n\n\nSteinmeier was appointed in November 1998 as Secretary of State, a junior Chancellery bureaucrat, and Commissioner for the Federal Intelligence Services at the office of the chancellor following Schröder's election victory. He replaced Bodo Hombach as the head of the office of the chancellor in 1999, after the later entered European Union politics.[18] He held onto his Secretary of State rank and therefore was the only Head of the Chancellery to not be appointed Minister for Special Affairs, i. e. does not have cabinet rank, from 1984 to today. During this period Steinmeier was also one of the advisors to Schröder.[18] He was crucial in securing a red-green majority in parliament for Schröder's contentious \"Agenda 2010\" of economic reforms.[5] Because of his effective management beyond the spotlight of politics, he was nicknamed *Die Graue Effizienz* (The Grey Efficiency) —a pun on *Graue Eminenz*, the German for éminence grise.\n\n\nAs Commissioner for the Federal Intelligence Services (a title often held by the Head of the Chancellery) Steinmeier was responsible for co-ordinating Germany's intelligence services.[19] In 2003, he supported Schröder in his controversial decision to forge a coalition with Russia and France against the U.S.-led war against Iraq.[20] Meanwhile, he approved the decision to install a German intelligence officer in the Qatar-based office of General Tommy Franks, the American commander of the U.S. invasion in Iraq, who passed on to the United States information being gathered in Baghdad by two German intelligence officers operating there.[21]\n\n\nIn 2004, Steinmeier participated in diplomatic negotiations settling on compensation payments with Libya for victims of the 1986 terrorist bombing of the LaBelle disco in Berlin.[22]\n\n\nA major controversy during Steinmeier's term as chief of staff was the imprisonment of a German-born Turk, Murat Kurnaz, in Guantánamo Bay from 2002 until August 2006. Steinmeier denied during a parliamentary inquiry in March 2007 that he had blocked Kurnaz's release. Instead, he claimed that Berlin had feared Kurnaz was a threat and should go to Turkey, not Germany, if released. Only after Merkel's election was Kurnaz released and brought back to Germany.[23]\n\n\n\n![](image)Frank-Walter Steinmeier (2009)\n### First term as Foreign Minister, 2005–2009[edit]\n\n\nOn 22 November 2005, after the 2005 federal elections, Steinmeier became Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Grand coalition cabinet led by Angela Merkel.[18] He was the first SPD Foreign Minister since Willy Brandt (1966–1969).\n\n\nUpon taking office, Steinmeier led the preparations for Germany taking over the rotating presidency of the Council of the European Union in the first half of 2007.\n\n\nFollowing Franz Müntefering's departure from the cabinet on 21 November 2007, Steinmeier also filled the position of Vice-Chancellor.[24]\n\n\nDuring his time in office, Steinmeier was widely regarded as having good working relations with Angela Merkel but often taking a different stance on foreign affairs.[5] By and large, he allowed Merkel to set the pace in foreign policy.,[19] working harmoniously with her on a range of foreign policy issues, from confronting Iran over its nuclear program to negotiating binding goals to combat climate change.[16] In one significant foreign-policy disagreement, Steinmeier held in 2009 that Germany should by 2013 lay the groundwork for withdrawing its troops from Afghanistan, a deployment that around two-thirds of Germans opposed by then.[25] Unlike Merkel, he also favored Turkish entry into the European Union.[16]\n\n\nAlso, Steinmeier became known for his rather Russia-friendly stance, arguing strenuously for engagement with the increasingly assertive power to the east, rather than its isolation.[26] He formulated a policy toward Russia deliberately reminiscent of \"Ostpolitik\", the eastward-facing policy pioneered by Chancellor Willy Brandt in the early 1970s.[27] Together with Gernot Erler, the SPD's leading Russia expert and the deputy foreign minister, Steinmeier initiated Germany's so-called Partnership for Modernization with Russia (announced in 2008), which became an official EU policy in 2010.[28]\n\n\nPressed by lawmakers to say more on his attitude toward Russia in the wake of the high-profile murders of opposition figures Anna Politkovskaya and Alexander Litvinenko at a 2007 hearing at the European Parliament, Steinmeier stated that \"[t]here is a certain trend toward [media] hysterics and one needs to get a sense of reason back into the debate\".[29] In May 2008, he became the first foreign official to hold talks with President Dmitri Medvedev and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin after they took up their new positions following the 2008 presidential elections.[30]\n\n\nIn 2006, *Foreign Affairs* published an analysis of the state of US and Russian nuclear forces, concluding that post-Cold War US nuclear forces seemed designed to carry out a preemptive strike against Russia or China and that the planned missile defense would be valuable primarily in an offensive context as an adjunct to a US first-strike capability.[31] The article elicited a semi-official Russian response from ex-PM Yegor Gaidar in the *Financial Times* a few days later.[32] In 2007, the US government reportedly was reportedly deeply irritated, although publicly silent, about Steinmeier, who had sounded supportive of Russian accusations that a planned US missile defense complex in Poland would upset the strategic balance in Europe – and who then left without challenge Russian General Nikolai Solovtsov's threat of retaliation against Poland and the Czech Republic if they deployed U.S. defensive systems.[33]\n\n\nRussian opposition activists later celebrated when Steinmeier and the SDP lost the 2009 election, signaling their discontent with Steinmeier. Oleg Petrovich Orlov, head of the Memorial human rights group, said that Steinmeier had prolonged Schröder's policies on Russia and that Germany's policies were \"extremely bad for civil society, democracy and the country as a whole\".[34]\n\n\nIn February 2009, Steinmeier became the first member of Merkel's cabinet to be received by the incoming Obama administration.[35]\n\n\nDuring his time in office, Steinmeier managed to extract German hostages from Iraq[36][37] and Yemen.[19] In 2007, he also succeeded in securing the release of a German citizen who was imprisoned in Iran for illegally entering the country's waters on a fishing expedition.[38]\n\n\nSteinmeier served as acting chairman of the SPD from 7 September 2008 to 18 October 2008. Domestically, throughout his term he was the only major politician with approval ratings consistently as high as or higher than Merkel's. This was helped by the especially high ratings foreign ministers generally receive in Germany.[26]\n\n\n\n### Opposition leader, 2009–2013[edit]\n\n\nOn 7 September 2008, following the resignation of SPD chairman Kurt Beck, Steinmeier was chosen as the SPD candidate for chancellor for the 2009 federal elections and also designated as acting SPD Chairman, pending the return of Müntefering to that position.[39] In his election campaign, he argued for new tax rules to deter high executive pay and bonuses, and for minimum wages to slow the growing gap between Germany's highest and lowest earners.[25] He also focused on improving public healthcare.[40]\n\n\n\n![](image)Germany's Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier addressing a dinner of the World Jewish Congress in Berlin, September 2014\nAfter the SPD's decisive defeat in the elections – the party's worst performance since World War II[41][42] by then – Steinmeier, who had been elected to represent Brandenburg an der Havel – Potsdam-Mittelmark I – Havelland III – Teltow-Fläming I, was elected Peter Struck's successor as chairman of the SPD's parliamentary group in the Bundestag, and as such leader of the opposition.[43] After a hospitalization for donating a kidney to his wife in August 2010, Steinmeier returned to his office in October 2010.\n\n\nDuring his time as leader of the parliamentary opposition, Steinmeier regularly accused Angela Merkel's government of increasing the national debt and pandering to the rich.[44] In 2011, Steinmeier argued that Merkel's decision to appoint her economics adviser, Jens Weidmann, to be the next head of Bundesbank undermined the political independence and public trust in the German central bank.[45]\n\n\nIn late 2012, Steinmeier was once again considered a possible candidate to challenge Chancellor Angela Merkel in the 2013 general election, but soon withdrew from the contest. As a consequence, SPD chairman Sigmar Gabriel later announced that the leadership agreed to nominate Peer Steinbrück.[46]\n\n\n\n### Second term as Foreign Minister, 2013–2017[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Steinmeier with John Kerry in March 2015\nAfter the elections of 2013 and the new grand coalition government, Steinmeier was appointed foreign minister for a second time in December 2013. He replaced Guido Westerwelle, who had signed the P5+1 accord with Iran in November 2013. His deputies are Michael Roth (SPD) and Maria Böhmer (CDU). Upon taking office, Steinmeier initiated an ambitious review of Germany's foreign policy, holding meetings nationwide and drawing in more than 12,000 people who work at the ministry or abroad.[47]\n\n\n\n![](image)Steinmeier with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in Tehran, February 2016\nOver the course of 2014, Steinmeier alternated with Merkel as Germany's most popular politician in polls of eligible voters.[48]\n\n\nIn light of criticism from the United States, Steinmeier stood firm on Germany's approach in the Ukraine conflict, where it was balancing support for European economic sanctions on Russia with leaving the door open to a revived partnership.[49] In May 2014, he proposed a greater mediation role for the OSCE, including the convening of local \"round table\" talks in Ukraine to defuse conflicts.[50] The **Steinmeier formula**, as it is known to readers of Russian media, is synonymous with the Minsk II agreement.[51] Between 2015 and 2016, Steinmeier hosted a series of Normandy format meetings in Berlin to negotiate a solution of the situation in the East of Ukraine.[52]\n\n\nDuring the Minsk II talks on a ceasefire for eastern Ukraine in early 2015, he successfully negotiated with Russian President Vladimir Putin on allowing German doctors to visit Ukrainian military pilot Nadiya Savchenko, who had been on hunger strike for more than two months in a Russian jail.[53] Steinmeier has repeatedly ruled out arms shipments to resolve the conflict,[54] and that was German policy until two days after the 24 February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, at which time Chancellor Olaf Scholz put an end to it.\n\n\nIn 2015, Steinmeier hosted a meeting of the delegations from Libya's two rival governments, who were battling for control of the country, and United Nations Special Representative Bernardino León to discuss a UN-sponsored peace and power-sharing proposal despite splits among some of the parties.[55]\n\n\nSteinmeier later was instrumental in convening the International Syria Support Group (ISSG) and the Syria peace talks in Vienna in October 2015, drawing together Saudi Arabia; its main regional rival, Iran; as well as Russia, the United States and other Western powers and regional actors including Turkey and Iraq.[56]\n\n\n\n### Political positions[edit]\n\n\n#### Human rights[edit]\n\n\nIn the past, *Human Rights Watch* has labeled Steinmeier as \"Realpolitik advocate\", for whom, \"when it comes to defining his relationship with countries\" such as Russia, China, Iran and Saudi Arabia, \"human rights play only a subordinate role\".[57][58]\n\n\nIn Steinmeier's opinion, the \"[r]ejection of capital punishment is one of the keystones of German human-rights policy. The death penalty goes against our fundamental ethic and moral principles\".[59] He personally called for the abolition of the death penalty in Uzbekistan; capital punishment in Uzbekistan has been abolished since 2008.[60] In April 2014, he summoned the Egyptian ambassador Mohamed Higazy after a Cairo court sentenced 683 individuals to death for inciting violence during protests in summer 2013, following the military overthrow of elected President Mohammed Morsi.[61] Following the 2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt, he warned that any move by Turkey to reinstate the death penalty would derail its efforts to join the European Union.[62] He criticized the 2016–present purges in Turkey.[63]\n\n\nIn response to the protests following the 2009 Iranian presidential election against the disputed victory of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Steinmeier condemned what he called \"brutal actions\" against demonstrators in Tehran and summoned the Iranian ambassador Alireza Sheikhattar to explain.[64]\n\n\n\n#### European integration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Steinmeier, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Polish President Lech Kaczyński in Brussels, June 2007\nAfter Germany had only narrowly managed to avoid a deficit warning from the European Commission in 2002, Schröder and Steinmeier became the driving forces behind weakening the Stability and Growth Pact, a rule-based framework for the coordination of national fiscal policies originally intended as the guarantor of a stable euro.[65]\n\n\nIn a joint article in the *Financial Times* on 14 December 2010, Steinmeier and Peer Steinbrück proposed to solve the European debt crisis with \"a combination of a haircut for debt holders, debt guarantees for stable countries and the limited introduction of European-wide bonds in the medium term, accompanied by more aligned fiscal policies\".[66] In February 2011, Steinmeier proposed Steinbrück as a candidate to lead the European Central Bank.[67]\n\n\nUnder Steinmeier's parliamentary leadership, the Social Democrats raised pressure on Chancellor Angela Merkel to agree to more burden-sharing to stem the euro zone crisis, repeatedly calling on her to assume greater risks to avert a breakup of the single currency.[68] In both February and November 2012, his parliamentary group voted largely in favour of the Merkel government's proposal for eurozone bailout packages for Greece,[69][70][71] while criticizing the measures as being \"not an enduring solution for the Greeks\".[72] In July 2014, he helped build the opposition's support for a euro zone rescue package for Spanish banks.[73] Later, as foreign minister, he publicly advised against \"frivolous\" talk of a Greek withdrawal from the eurozone, calling for a serious search for a solution.[74]\n\n\nReacting to a growth of euro-skeptic political parties across Europe by early 2014, Steinmeier offered the United Kingdom limited support on renegotiating the Treaties of the European Union, saying Germany wanted to see Britain's influence in the \"midst\" of the EU, not on \"the sidelines\".[75] After Britain's vote to leave the EU in 2016, he argued that the union lacked the cohesion to undertake major new integration steps and should instead focus on migration, high youth unemployment and security.[76]\n\n\nAt the same time, Steinmeier worked to develop new formats and revive new ones. In December 2014, he met with the foreign ministers from the three Nordic countries Denmark, Finland and Sweden – Margot Wallström, Erkki Tuomioja and Martin Lidegaard – for the so-called \"N3 + 1\" format to discuss issues of common concern for the first time.[77]\n\n\nIn August 2016, he joined French foreign minister Jean-Marc Ayrault in pledging to \"reinvigorate\" the Weimar Triangle and published a document 'A strong Europe in a world of uncertainties'.[78]\n\n\nBetween 2014 and 2016, he visited the three Baltic states – Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania – six times, the highest number of visits by any German Foreign Minister.[79][80]\n\n\nAlso in late 2014, Steinmeier and his British counterpart Philip Hammond united in a bid to end a deadlock in relations between Bosnia and the European Union, arguing that the EU should abandon its insistence on changes to Bosnia's electoral code as a precondition for a Stabilization and Association Agreement on the path to EU membership.[81]\n\n\n\n#### Energy policy[edit]\n\n\nIn 2007, Steinmeier said he opposes European Commission proposals on unbundling the ownership of energy networks in the European Union, as it was proposed in the Third Energy Package.[82]\n\n\n\n#### Relations with France[edit]\n\n\nOn 14 May 2014, Steinmeier became the first German foreign minister to attend a meeting of the French cabinet.[83] Together with his French counterpart Laurent Fabius, he flew on several joint diplomatic missions between 2014 and 2015, including to Moldova, Georgia,[84] Tunisia, Nigeria and Bangladesh. In 2016, he joined Fabius' successor Jean-Marc Ayrault for trips to Ukraine, Libya,[85] Mali[86] and Niger.[87]\n\n\n\n#### Relations with Russia[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Steinmeier with Vladimir Putin, March 2016\nIn May 2007, the daily *Financial Times Deutschland* reported that Steinmeier had served as mediator in the so-called Bronze Night controversy, an Estonia-Russia dispute over the removal of a Red Army memorial in Tallinn. According to the report, Steinmeier suggested the Estonian ambassador to Russia, Marina Kaljurand, go on vacation in an effort to calm the situation. Steinmeier called his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov to suggest not only that Kaljurand take a holiday, but also that Russia drop the dispute for the time being. After speaking with Lavrov, Steinmeier reportedly called Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Paet and got him to agree to the deal. Kaljurand left Moscow for a two-week vacation and pro-Kremlin youth activists blockading the Estonian embassy in Moscow ended their protests the same day.[88]\n\n\nUpon returning to government in late 2013, Steinmeier criticized Russia in his inaugural speech for exploiting Ukraine's economic plight to prevent it from signing the Ukraine–European Union Association Agreement.[89] In March 2014, he defended Russia's membership of the G8, saying \"The format of the G8 is actually the only one in which we in the West can speak directly with Russia.\"[90] When Germany held the chairmanship of the group in 2015, he maintained that excluding Russia over its actions in Ukraine was a necessary step but not a goal in itself; citing the Middle East, he argued that \"a look at the world shows that we need Russia as a constructive partner in a number of conflicts\".[91]\n\n\nIn a 2015 letter to Cecilia Malmström, the EU's trade chief, Steinmeier proposed a joint declaration between the EU and Russia offering Moscow the prospect of long-sought investment and energy concessions to create a more integrated economic area from the Atlantic to the Pacific. According to the letter, \"by the content of this declaration we could respond to Russia's wishes and begin a closer exchange of views on energy and investment protection issues, even if the Ukraine–European Union Association Agreement does not directly touch on them\".[92]\n\n\nIn June 2016, Steinmeier criticised NATO 'warmongering' on Russia: \"The one thing we shouldn't do now is inflame the situation with loud sabre-rattling and warmongering.\"[93] The CDU politicians Volker Bouffier and Herbert Reul criticised him for his stance on Russia,[8] while his comments were welcomed by the Russian media.[94]\n\n\nIn their book *Die Moskau-Connection*, journalists Bingener and Wehner describe the network around Schröder and his support for Putin's policies. Steinmeier was part of that network. Bingener and Wehner write that Steinmeier considered Putin to be rational and accessible. Steinmeier also did not draw any conclusions from the annexation of Crimea in February 2014.[95] Steinmeier did not resolutely oppose Putin's logic, in which there is only winning and losing. Bingener and Wehner:[96]\n\n\n\n\n> This is another reason why he is well-liked in Moscow. He is a rather timid person. While his predecessor Joschka Fischer got along with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov easily and often interrupted his suades, Steinmeier has a hard time speaking to Lavrov. 'Dear Sergei', as Steinmeier sometimes calls him, is often harsh and hurtful to his interlocutors. He doesn't need to be that with the German Foreign Minister.\n> \n> \n\n\n#### Relations with the United States[edit]\n\n\nSteinmeier voiced his support for Barack Obama when Obama was still a presidential candidate, and supported Obama's wish to deliver a speech before the iconic Brandenburg Gate during the 2008 U.S. presidential campaign.[97]\n\n\nIn 2016 Steinmeier described then-U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump as a \"hate preacher\".[98][99][100] After Trump's election, Steinmeier refused to congratulate him, and condemned Trump's views.[101][102] He has been described as \"the German government's most strident detractor\" of Trump.[103]\n\n\n\n#### Relations with Central Asia[edit]\n\n\nDuring a 2006 meeting with Turkmen President Saparmurat Niyazov, Steinmeier criticized Turkmenistan for its slow progress in implementing the rule of law and human rights and said that the state's progress in carrying out political reforms had been \"too halting\".[104]\n\n\nWhen Germany chaired a United Nations group aimed at resolving 2008 Russo-Georgian diplomatic crisis, Steinmeier presented to the three conflict parties – Georgia, Abkhazia and Russia – a plan which included a three-stage peace proposal, entailing an end to violence, confidence-building measures over the following year that could lead to the resumption of direct talks between Georgia and Abkhazia, and the return of about 250,000 Georgian refugees to Abkhazia. However, both Georgia and Abkhazia rejected the proposal.[105] In September 2008, Steinmeier called for an international probe into the conflict over Georgia's breakaway provinces.[106] During a 2014 visit to the country, he reiterated that membership of NATO and of the EU would remain off the cards for a long while to come.[107]\n\n\nIn August 2006, Steinmeier made his first visit to Afghanistan, where Germany had taken over the command of the 21,000-strong NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) shortly before.[108] Ahead of the 2009 federal elections, Steinmeier – then still in his capacity as foreign minister – commissioned an internal report on Germany's engagement in Afghanistan which recommended that Germany should start pulling out of the country within four years; at the time, this was seen as a stark departure from Steinmeier's earlier insistence Germany should not set a date for withdrawing its then 4,200-strong contingent from the north of Afghanistan as the move could play into the hands of Taliban insurgents.[109]\n\n\nIn October 2014, Steinmeier visited both Armenia and Azerbaijan to facilitate a negotiated solution to the long-standing conflict over Nagorny Karabakh, a region of Azerbaijan controlled by ethnic Armenians.[110] In 2016, he returned to both countries to in his capacity as chairman of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) to reinvigorate the talks.[111]\n\n\n\n#### Israeli–Palestinian conflict[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Steinmeier and Israeli President Reuven Rivlin in Jerusalem, July 2021\nIn the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, Steinmeier supports a two-state solution and calls for an end to the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories. He welcomed the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334 and said the Israeli settlements on occupied territory form an obstacle to peace and a two-state solution.[112] He further said that \"a democratic Israel is achievable only through a two-state-solution\".[113] Steinmeier praised the speech by US Secretary of State John Kerry which outlined the United States' position on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict in December 2016; in the speech Kerry said a peace agreement must be based on the 1967 lines, that all citizens must enjoy equal rights, that occupation must end, that the Palestinian refugee issue must be resolved, and that Jerusalem must be the capital of both states, and criticised the Netanyahu government's agenda as driven by \"extreme elements\".[114]\n\n\n\n#### Relations with Iran[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The ministers of foreign affairs and diplomats announcing an Iran nuclear deal framework in Lausanne in April 2015\nSteinmeier is a staunch proponent of the Iran nuclear deal framework, and has called the agreement \"an opening for further diplomatic endeavors\".[115]\n\n\n\n#### Relations with the Arab world[edit]\n\n\nSteinmeier has visited the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan twice to learn more about the plight of Syrians fleeing the violence in the ongoing Syrian civil war that erupted in 2011,[116] first in his capacity as chairman of the SPD parliamentary group in May 2013 and later as foreign minister in May 2015.[117] In early 2014, upon taking office as foreign minister, he agreed with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen that Germany would help destroy Syria's arsenal of chemical weapons materials as part of an international disarmament program.[118] In October 2014, he co-chaired the Berlin Conference on the Syrian Refugee Situation along with Development Minister Gerd Müller and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, António Guterres.[119]\n\n\nIn March 2015, Steinmeier said he \"can understand\" Saudi Arabia's decision to mount a military intervention in Yemen and acknowledged the operation had \"support from the region\". However, he said the crisis could not be solved by violence and urged a negotiated solution.[120]\n\n\n\n#### Relations with Greece[edit]\n\n\nIn 2015 Steinmeier rejected claims for war reparations from the Greek Syriza party in response to Germany's position on the Greek government-debt crisis. When incoming Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, in his first major speech to parliament in early 2015, pledged to seek war reparations from Germany, Steinmeier replied to Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Kotzias that Germany was fully aware of its political and moral responsibility for the \"terrible events\" in Greece between 1941 and 1944 when German troops occupied the country. \"Still, we are firmly convinced that all reparations issues, including forced loans, are judicially settled once-and-for-all,\" Steinmeier said.[121]\n\n\n\n### Controversies[edit]\n\n\n#### Refusal to meet with Dalai Lama[edit]\n\n\nSteinmeier openly attacked Merkel over her 2007 meeting with the Dalai Lama, accusing the chancellor of \"playing to public opinion\" without regard for the effectiveness of the meeting in improving political or religious rights on the ground in China.[122] In 2008, he refused to meet the Dalai Lama during his five-day visit, arguing that such a meeting could undermine international efforts to promote sustained contact between China and Tibet.[123] Instead, Steinmeier issued the statement \"it takes a lot of courage not to meet with the Dalai Lama these days\",[124] which *The New York Times* described as \"extraordinarily cynical\" and accused Steinmeier of prioritizing business interests over human rights.[7][125]\n\n\n\n#### Murat Kurnaz torture case[edit]\n\n\nIn the case of Murat Kurnaz, innocently imprisoned in 2002 and tortured by the US, Steinmeier allegedly had an offer by the United States Department of Defense and the CIA already in September 2002 regarding a transfer of Murat Kurnaz to Germany, where he was born and raised. Kurnaz had been first sold as a terror suspect in Pakistan, then imprisoned in Afghanistan and later in Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba, until 2006. By refusing the offer Steinmeier is thought to have been politically directly responsible for his continued imprisonment.[126][127][128]\n\n\nA BND-commission of enquiry was consulted.[129]\n\n\n\n#### Armenian genocide denial[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Armenian Genocide denial\n\nDuring a 2015 debate about Germany's recognition of the Armenian genocide on the occasion of its centenary, Steinmeier was the politician most reluctant to endorse it, mainly because of Germany's relations with Turkey.[130] He was widely criticized for his position and accused of Armenian genocide denial.[131][132] When the German Bundestag almost unanimously approved a resolution in 2016 that recognises the killings of up to 1.5 million Armenians by Ottoman forces as a genocide, a description that Turkey strongly rejects, Steinmeier abstained from the vote and criticized the resolution in public; Steinmeier was one of only two of the 630 members of parliament who did not support the resolution.[133] And Steinmeier alleged that calling Armenian massacres genocide risks belittling the Holocaust.[134]\n\n\n\n#### Plagiarism allegations[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the 2013 elections, Steinmeier became the first prominent member of the Social Democrats to be confronted with allegations that he plagiarized parts of his 1991 doctoral dissertation about the role of the state in the prevention of homelessness.[13] Similar accusations had previously led to the resignation of two ministers of the Merkel government.[13] In response, Steinmeier rejected the charges and said that he had asked the University of Giessen to check his dissertation for unacknowledged citations.[13] In May 2013, a university committee for safeguarding academic practices found that Steinmeier had no fraudulent intent and had not committed academic misconduct in his dissertation.[135] The committee did find \"technical weaknesses\" in Steinmeier's citations, but said they were not severe enough to consider revoking his degree.[135]\n\n\n\n## Presidency (2017–present)[edit]\n\n\n### Candidacy for President[edit]\n\n\nPresident Joachim Gauck announced in June 2016 that he would not run for re-election, resulting in a search for a candidate to succeed him.[136] In November 2016, Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives agreed with the Social Democrats to support Steinmeier's candidacy for president in the presidential election, scheduled for 12 February 2017.[137]\n\n\nMerkel had originally wanted to nominate Green politician Marianne Birthler, and as the CDU/CSU and the Greens control a majority in the Federal Convention, Birthler's election would have been secured. However, Birthler after some time decided not to run.[138]\n\n\nOn 12 February 2017 Germany's 16th Federal Convention elected Steinmeier President on the first ballot, with 931 votes out of a total of 1,260.\n\n\nSteinmeier took office as President of Germany on 19 March 2017, after the expiration of his predecessor's term in office, and on 22 March 2017 he took the oath that newly invested presidents must take before a joint session of the Bundestag and the Bundesrat, according to the Basic Law.\n\n\n\n### German federal election 2017[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Steinmeier with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko in Kyiv, May 2018\nFollowing the federal election in September 2017, coalition talks began between the Christian Democratic Union, Christian Social Union, Free Democratic Party and the Green Party. The talks continued for 4 weeks until just past midnight on 20 November when the Free Democrats and their leader Christian Lindner walked out of the talks and they subsequently collapsed.[139] The collapse of the talks left another Grand Coalition as the only coalition with a majority in the Bundestag; this however seemed difficult, as the Leader of the Social Democratic Party Martin Schulz[140] had ruled out another Grand Coalition on multiple occasions. \n\n\nIn the following weeks, Steinmeier played an important role in the formation of the next government. This is because if the Bundestag fails to elect a chancellor in 14 days of voting,[141] the president can either appoint the individual with most votes to lead a minority government or dissolve the Bundestag and call new elections. This type of political crisis had never been seen in Germany before and pushed the president into a quite powerful position which is rare for Germany. Steinmeier declared he would not consider a dissolution of the Bundestag as a preferable solution, and managed to persuade Schulz to meet with Angela Merkel and start preliminary talks. After long coalition talks, CDU, CSU and SPD formed a new grand coalition. Merkel was re-elected in the Bundestag on 14 March 2018.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### 2022 re-election[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Steinmeier with Finnish prime minister Sanna Marin in Helsinki, April 2022\nOn 13 February 2022 he was re-elected as president.[142]\n\n\n\n#### Ukraine controversy[edit]\n\n\nShortly after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Steinmeier expressed regret for his earlier stance on Russia, saying his years of support for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline had been a clear mistake.[143] In April 2022 he called for a war crimes tribunal against Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.[144] Steinmeier said that he \"wrongly believed that Vladimir Putin would not precipitate a complete economic, political, and moral devastation of his country because of his imperial mania.\"[145]\n\n\nIn April 2022, Steinmeier abandoned plans to visit Kyiv after admitting he would not be welcome in Ukraine in what was seen as a serious snub for one of Germany's senior politicians. At the time, German news media cited Ukrainian officials as saying that the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky would refuse to meet Steinmeier if he came to Kyiv.[146] Ukraine had previously criticized Steinmeier for his connections to Russia and his role in strengthening German-Russian relations under the *Wandel durch Handel* policy.[147]\n\n\nOn 25 October 2022, Steinmeier made an official visit to Ukraine, after a scheduled visit on 20 October was cancelled for security reasons due to a wave of cruise missile and drone attacks across Ukraine.[148][149][150] At the time, DW News was talking about a new 350bn euro Marshall Plan to aid Ukraine even while Russian bombs were still falling from Kyiv skies.[149] Upon his return to Berlin he spoke at length of his Ukrainian experiences on 28 October, and opened with vivid descriptions of the horrors of war, noting that it had caused \"the deepest crisis\" that a reunified Germany has seen. He warned that \"tougher, rough years are ahead of us.\"[151]\n\n\nOn 29 November 2022 Steinmeier was interviewed in his palace again on this subject by a journalist from Deutsche Welle. He condemned Russia's recent attacks on civilians and on gas and electricity supplies in Ukraine, \"A cease-fire now would mean Russia would keep the territories it has occupied..

He is the longest-serving president in the history of the Italian Republic. Following Giorgio Napolitano's death in 2023, Mattarella became the only living Italian president.[1]\n\n\nA Catholic leftist politician, Mattarella was a leading member of the Christian Democracy party from the early 1980s until its dissolution. He served as Minister for Parliamentary Relations from 1987 to 1989, and Minister of Education from 1989 to 1990. In 1994, Mattarella was among the founders of the Italian People's Party (PPI), serving as Deputy Prime Minister of Italy from 1998 to 1999, and Minister of Defence from 1999 to 2001. He joined The Daisy in 2002 and was one of the founders of the Democratic Party (PD) in 2007, leaving it when he retired from politics in 2008. He also served as a judge of the Constitutional Court of Italy from 2011 to 2015.[2]\n\n\nOn 31 January 2015, Mattarella was elected to the presidency on the fourth ballot, supported by the centre-left coalition majority led by the PD and centrist parties.[3] He was re-elected for a second term on 29 January 2022, becoming the second Italian president to be re-elected, the first being Napolitano.[4] As of 2023, five prime ministers have served under his presidency, among them Matteo Renzi, then the PD's leader and main sponsor of his presidential candidacy,[5] Paolo Gentiloni, a leading member of the PD who succeeded Renzi after his resignation in 2016,[6] Giuseppe Conte, at that time an independent politician who governed both with right-wing and left-wing coalitions in two consecutive cabinets,[7] Mario Draghi, a banker and former president of the European Central Bank, who was appointed by Mattarella to lead a national unity government following Conte's resignation,[8] and Giorgia Meloni, first ever female prime minister and leader of the right-wing coalition which won the general election in September 2022.[9]\n\n\nDuring his long-time tenure, Italy faced the aftermath of the Great Recession, as well as the severe European migrant crisis, which deeply marked Italian political, economic and social life, bringing to the rise of populist parties.[10] Moreover, in 2020, Italy became one of the countries worst affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, being the first country in the Western world to implement a national lockdown to stop the spread of the disease.[11][12]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sergio Mattarella with his father Bernardo Mattarella in 1963\nMattarella was born in Palermo on 23 July 1941 into a prominent Sicilian family. His father Bernardo Mattarella was an anti-fascist who, alongside Alcide De Gasperi and other Catholic politicians, founded Christian Democracy (DC), which dominated the Italian political scene for almost fifty years, with Bernardo serving as a minister several times. Bernardo Mattarella has also been accused of being associated with the Sicilian Mafia; however, accusations were always rejected in court.[13][14] His mother Maria Buccellato came from an upper-middle-class family of Trapani.[15][16]\n\n\nDuring his youth, Mattarella moved to Rome due to his father's commitments to politics. In Rome, he became a member of Azione Cattolica (AC), a large Catholic lay association, of which he became the regional chairman for Lazio from 1961 to 1964.[17] After attending Istituto San Leone Magno, a classical lyceum (*liceo classico*) in Rome,[18] he studied law at the Sapienza University of Rome, where he joined the Italian Catholic Federation of University Students (FUCI).[19]\n\n\nIn 1964, Mattarella graduated with merit with the thesis *The Function of Political Direction*.[20] In 1967, he became a lawyer in Palermo, becoming particularly involved in administrative law.[21] After a few years, Mattarella started teaching parliamentary procedure at the University of Palermo, where he remained until 1983. His academic activity and publications during this period mainly concerned constitutional law topics, the intervention of Sicilian government in economy, bicameralism, legislative procedure, expropriation allowance, evolution of the Sicilian regional administration, and controls on local authorities.[22]\n\n\nIn 1966, Mattarella married Marisa Chiazzese, daughter of Lauro Chiazzese, former rector of the University of Palermo, with whom he had three children: Laura, Francesco, and Bernardo.[23] On 6 January 1980, his older brother Piersanti Mattarella, who was also a DC politician and president of Sicily since 1978, was killed by the Sicilian Mafia in Palermo.[24] This event deeply changed Mattarella's life, and he left his academic career to enter politics.[25]\n\n\n\n## Political career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mattarella's first portrait as a deputy in 1983\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | This article is part of a series aboutSergio Mattarella |\n\n |\n| * **Offices**Minister for Parliamentary Relations (1987–89)Minister of Public Education (1989–90)Deputy Prime Minister of Italy (1998–99)Minister of Defence (1999–2001)Judge of the Constitutional Court (2011–15)President of Italy (2015–present)\n\n\n\n---\n\n* **Member of the Chamber of Deputies**\n* Italian electoral law of 1993\n\n\n\n---\n\n* **Minister of Defence**\n* Kosovo War\n\t+ NATO bombing\n* Abolition of conscription\n\n\n\n---\n\n* **President of Italy**Incumbent\n* Presidential elections (2015, 2022)\n* General elections (2018, 2022)\n* Referendums (2016, 2020)\n* Government formations (2016, 2018, 2019, 2021, 2022)\n* Government crisis (2019, 2021, 2022)\n* COVID-19 pandemic\n* 2020 lockdowns\n* Quirinal Treaty\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nCabinets\n* Renzi\n* Gentiloni\n* Conte I\n* Conte II\n* Draghi\n* Meloni\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n![](image) |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\nOne of the first important positions that Mattarella held was the head of the board of arbitrators of the DC, quickly reconstituted at the end of 1981 following the Propaganda Due scandal and the establishment of the related parliamentary commission of inquiry, chaired by Tina Anselmi. The internal body of the party had been charged with identifying the militants registered in the Masonic lodge of Licio Gelli to expel or suspend them, having violated the statute of the party that prohibited registration to Masonic lodges.[26] Mattarella's parliamentary career began in 1983, when he was elected member of the Chamber of Deputies with nearly 120,000 votes in the constituency of Palermo.[27] As a deputy, Mattarella joined the left-leaning faction of the DC known as *morotei*. The faction, close to Aldo Moro,[28] supported an agreement with the Italian Communist Party (PCI) led by Enrico Berlinguer, the so-called Historic Compromise; his brother Piersanti Mattarella also supported it.[29][30]\n\n\nIn 1982, *Cosa Nostra* killed the PCI regional secretary Pio La Torre and the prefect of Palermo Carlo Alberto dalla Chiesa. These tragic events shook the credibility of the regional political system dominated by DC. In the following year, Mattarella was entrusted by Ciriaco De Mita, the DC secretary, to \"clean up\" the Sicilian branch of the party from Mafia control, at a time when mafia made men like Salvo Lima and Vito Ciancimino were powerful political figures in the region.[31] In 1985, he helped the young lawyer Leoluca Orlando, who had worked alongside his brother Piersanti during his governorship of Sicily, to become the new mayor of Palermo; the two men set out to break the Mafia's hold on the island, transferring budget authority from the corrupt regional government back to the cities and passing a law enforcing the same building standards used in the rest of Italy, thereby making the Mafia's building schemes illegal.[32] In 1987, Mattarella was re-elected to the Chamber of Deputies with more than 143,000 votes,[33] remaining close to the left-leaning faction of the party as well as to its secretary De Mita.[34]\n\n\n\n### Minister and lawmaker[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 1993 Italian referendum and Italian electoral law of 1993\n\nOn 29 July 1987, Mattarella was appointed Italian Minister for Parliamentary Relations in the government led by the DC prime minister Giovanni Goria.[35] The government lasted until April 1988, when De Mita was sworn in as new prime minister; however, Mattarella was confirmed as minister.[36]\n\n\nIn March 1989, a maxi-competition for professorships was held for the secondary school. Mattarella reorganized also the teaching programs of two-year high schools, completing the first steps of the so-called \"Brocca project\", the educational system's revision program, undertaken under his predecessor Giovanni Galloni in 1988.[37] Mattarella also oversaw the overall reform of the elementary school, which made the three teachers' module on two classes universal on 23 May 1990, leading to the overcoming of the traditional single teacher.[38]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mattarella in 1994\nOn 23 July 1989, Mattarella became Italian Minister of Education in the sixth cabinet of Giulio Andreotti.[39] In January 1990, Mattarella led the first National School Conference, which discussed the renewal of the educational system and addressed the issue of school autonomy.[40] At the end of June 1990, the so-called \"anti-drug law\" was approved, which mandated health education to schools; the combination of the education system and preventive measures, not only in health matters, was part of the programmatic lines that the minister had drawn. On 27 July 1990, Mattarella resigned from his position, together with other ministers, upon the Italian Parliament's passing in 1990 of the Mammì Act, liberalising the media in Italy, which they saw as a favour to the media magnate Berlusconi.[41]\n\n\nIn 1990, Mattarella was elected deputy secretary of the DC. He left the post two years later to become director of *Il Popolo*, the official newspaper of the party.[41] Following the 1993 Italian referendum, he drafted the new electoral law nicknamed *Mattarellum*.[42] The electoral law consisted in a parallel voting system, which act as a mixed system, with 75% of seats allocated using a first-past-the-post electoral system and 25% using proportional representation, with one round of voting.[43][44]\n\n\nDuring those years in the early 1990s, the whole Italian political system was shocked by the *Tangentopoli* corruption scandal;[45] Mattarella was not directly involved in the scandal. In August 1993, he was among the recipients of an investigation's notification that followed the statements of a Sicilian real estate entrepreneur, who accused him. Mattarella resigned from all his posts and was thanked by Mino Martinazzoli, the then DC leader, who expressed his support to him. Martinazzoli's statement was publicly criticized by Francesco Cossiga because it was in contrast with what was done for other politicians involved in the scandal. Mattarella was later acquitted of the charge.[46]\n\n\n\n### Minister within the centre-left[edit]\n\n\nMattarella was one of the protagonists of the renewal of the DC after *Tangentopoli* that would lead in January 1994 to the foundation of the Italian People's Party (PPI).[41] In the ensuing 1994 Italian general election, in which the newly founded PPI fared poorly, Mattarella was again elected to the Chamber of Deputies.[47] He soon found himself engaged in an internal dispute after the election of new party leader Rocco Buttiglione, who wished to steer the PPI towards an electoral alliance with Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia (FI).[41] Following Buttiglione's appointment, Mattarella resigned as director of *Il Popolo* in opposition to this policy.[48] In a 20 July 1994 interview with *l'Unità*, Mattarella considered the new political proposal that was taking shape for a new centre-left coalition interesting, \"especially for those who are very nostalgic for Aldo Moro's political strategy.\"[49] In 1995, at the height of the internal conflict within the PPI, he addressed Buttiglione, who was stubbornly seeking an alliance with the political right, as \"el general coup leader Roquito Butillone\" and defined \"an irrational nightmare\" the hypothesis that Berlusconi's FI could be accepted into the European People's Party.[50]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mattarella with the U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen in March 2000\nMattarella was one of the first supporters of the economist Romano Prodi at the head of the centre-left coalition known as The Olive Tree in the 1996 Italian general election. After the electoral victory of the centre-left, Mattarella served as leader of the PPI's parliamentary group.[51] Two years later, when the Prodi I Cabinet fell, Mattarella was appointed by Massimo D'Alema as Deputy Prime Minister of Italy with responsibility for the secret services, which he tried to reform. The reform of the secret services proposed by Mattarella collected the indications provided by the Jucci Commission, which had worked extensively on the subject, and aimed at strengthening the political control of the services by the prime minister of Italy, in coordination with the Digis (Government Department of Security Information), by removing power from the Interior Ministry and Defense.[52] It was the basis for the 2007 reform of the secret services.[53]\n\n\nIn December 1999, Mattarella was appointed Italian Minister of Defence in the D'Alema II Cabinet. As Minister of Defence, he supported the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia against the Serbian president Slobodan Milošević; he also approved a reform of the Italian Armed Forces which abolished conscription. After the resignation of D'Alema in 2000, Mattarella kept his position as Minister of Defence in the Amato II Cabinet.[41]\n\n\nIn October 2000, the PPI joined with other centrist parties to form an alliance called The Daisy (DL), later to merge into a single party in March 2002. Mattarella was re-elected to the Italian Parliament in the 2001 and 2006 general elections, standing as a candidate for The Daisy in two successive centre-left coalitions: The Olive Tree and The Union (*L'Unione*).[47] In 2007, Mattarella was one of the founders of the Democratic Party (PD), a big tent centre-left party formed from a merger of left-wing and centrist parties which had been part of The Olive Tree, including The Daisy and the Democrats of the Left (heirs of the PCI).[41]\n\n\nOn 5 October 2011, Mattarella was elected by the Italian Parliament with 572 votes to be a judge of the Constitutional Court of Italy. He was sworn in on 11 October 2011 and served until he was sworn in as President of the Italian Republic in January 2015.[54][47]\n\n\n\n## President of Italy (2015–present)[edit]\n\n\n### First term (2015–2022)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)First term's official portrait\n![](image)Mattarella with his predecessor Giorgio Napolitano\nOn 31 January 2015, Mattarella was elected the president of Italy at the fourth ballot with 665 votes out of 1,009, with support from the Democratic Party (PD), New Centre-Right, Civic Choice, Union of the Centre, and Left Ecology Freedom.[55][56] Mattarella was officially endorsed by the PD after his name was put forward by Matteo Renzi, the prime minister of Italy at the time.[57] He replaced Giorgio Napolitano, who had served for nine years, the longest presidency in the history of the Italian Republic; since Napolitano had resigned on 14 January, Senate president Pietro Grasso was the Acting President at the time of Mattarella's inauguration on 3 February. Mattarella's first statement as new president was thusly: \"My thoughts go first and especially to the difficulties and hopes of our fellow citizens.\"[58][59][60]\n\n\nMattarella's first presidential visit was on the day of his election, when he visited the Fosse Ardeatine, where during World War II in 1944 the German Nazi occupation troops killed 335 people as a reprisal for an Italian resistance movement attack. Mattarella stated that \"Europe and the world must be united to defeat whoever wants to drag us into a new age of terror\".[61]\n\n\nOn 16 February 2015, Mattarella appointed Ugo Zampetti as Secretary-General to the Presidency of the Republic, the head of the presidential secretariat.[62] While three days before, on 13 February, the President appointed Giovanni Grasso as his special counselor for press and communication.[63] As of 2023, Zampetti, a civil servant with a long-time experience within Italian politics, and Grasso, a journalist and writer, are still holding their posts.[64]\n\n\nOn 6 May, he signed the new Italian electoral law, known as *Italicum*, which provides for a two-round system based on party-list proportional representation, corrected by a majority bonus and a 3% election threshold. Candidates run for election in 100 multi-member constituencies with open lists, except for a single candidate chosen by each party who is the first to be elected.[65]\n\n\n\n#### 2016 political crisis[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2016 Italian constitutional referendum\n\n![](image)President Mattarella and Prime Minister Matteo Renzi in 2015\nOn 4 December 2016, a constitutional referendum was held in Italy.[66][67] Voters were asked whether they approve a constitutional law that amends the Constitution of Italy to reform the composition and powers of the Parliament of Italy, as well as the division of powers between the state, the regions, and administrative entities.[68][69] The bill, put forward by then-Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, and his centre-left Democratic Party, was first introduced by the government in the Senate on 8 April 2014. After several amendments were made to the proposed law by both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, the bill received its first approval on 13 October 2015 (Senate) and 11 January 2016 (Chamber of Deputies), and its second and final approval on 20 January (Senate) and 12 April (Chamber of Deputies).[70]\n\n\nIn accordance with Article 138 of the Constitution of Italy, a referendum was called after the formal request of more than one-fifth of the members of both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies,[71] since the constitutional law had not been approved by a qualified majority of two-thirds in each house of parliament in the second vote.[72] 59.11% of voters voted against the constitutional reform, meaning it did not come into effect.[73] This was the third constitutional referendum in the history of the Italian Republic; the other two were in 2001, in which the amending law was approved, and in 2006, in which it was rejected.[74]\n\n\nFollowing the defeat, Prime Minister Renzi resigned. On 11 December, Mattarella appointed the incumbent Minister of Foreign Affairs Paolo Gentiloni as new head of the government.[75] Gentiloni led a government composed by PD, NCD, and other minor centrist parties, the same majority of Renzi's.[76] According to many political analysts and commentators, the appointment of Gentiloni caused tensions between Mattarella and Renzi, who asked the president to dissolve the parliament and call for a snap election in 2017.[77] This version was later confirmed by Renzi during a press conference following the 2018 general election, in which he stated it was an error not to vote in 2017.[78]\n\n\n\n#### 2018 general election and government formation[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2018 Italian general election and 2018 Italian government formation\n\nThe March 2018 election resulted in a hung parliament, with no coalitions able to form a majority of seats in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. The election was seen as a backlash against the Establishment with the Five Star Movement (M5S) and the League becoming the two largest parties in the Parliament.[79][80]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mattarella with Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni on 24 March 2018\nAfter the election's results were known, Luigi Di Maio, leader of the M5S, and Matteo Salvini, secretary of the League, each urged that Mattarella should give him the task of forming a new cabinet because he led the largest party or coalition, respectively.[81] On 5 March, Matteo Renzi declared the PD to be in the opposition during this legislature and resigned as party leader when a new cabinet was formed.[82] On 6 March, Salvini repeated his campaign message that his party would refuse any coalition with the M5S.[83] On 14 March, Salvini offered to govern with the M5S, imposing the condition that League ally Forza Italia (FI), led by former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, must also take part in any coalition. Di Maio rejected this proposal on the grounds that Salvini was \"choosing restoration instead of revolution\" because \"Berlusconi represents the past\".[84] Moreover, Alessandro Di Battista, a prominent M5S leader, denied any possibility of an alliance with FI, describing Berlusconi as the \"pure evil of our country\".[85]\n\n\nThe consultations between Mattarella and the major political parties in Italy on 4 and 5 April failed to result in a candidate for the prime minister, forcing Mattarella to hold another round of consultation between 11 and 12 April.[86]\n\n\nOn 18 April, Mattarella tasked the President of the Senate Elisabetta Casellati with trying to reconcile the issues between the centre-right coalition and the M5S in order to break the post-election political deadlock and form a fully functional new government;[87][88] however, she failed to find a solution to the conflicts between the two groups, especially between FI and the M5S.[89][90] On 23 April, after Casellati's failure, Mattarella gave an exploratory mandate to the President of the Chamber of Deputies Roberto Fico to try to create a political agreement between the Democratic Party (PD) and the M5S.[91][92][93] On 30 April, following an interview of Renzi, the PD's former leader, in which he expressed his strong opposition to an alliance with the M5S, Di Maio called for new elections.[94][95][96]\n\n\n\n![](image)President Mattarella receiving Carlo Cottarelli in May 2018\nOn 7 May, Mattarella held a third round of government formation talks, after which he formally confirmed the lack of any possible majority (the M5S rejecting an alliance with the centre-right coalition, the PD rejecting an alliance with both M5S and the centre-right coalition, and the League's Salvini refusing to form a government with M5S unless it included Berlusconi's FI, whose presence in the government was explicitly vetoed by the M5S's leader Di Maio); as a result, he stated his intention to soon appoint a \"neutral government\" (ignoring the M5S and the League's refusal to support such an option) to take over from the Gentiloni Cabinet, which was considered unable to lead Italy into a second consecutive election, as it represented a majority from a past legislature, and suggested an early election in July, which would be the first summer general election in Italy, as an option in light of the ongoing deadlock.[97] The League and the M5S agreed to hold new elections on 8 July, an option that was rejected by all other parties.[98][99][100]\n\n\nOn 9 May, after a day of rumours, the M5S and the League officially asked Mattarella to give them 24 more hours to strike a coalition agreement between the two parties.[101] Later that same day, Berlusconi stated that FI would not support an M5S–League government on a vote of confidence but would maintain the centre-right alliance, opening the door to a possible majority government between the two parties.[102] On 13 May, the M5S and League reached an agreement in principle on a government program, clearing the way for the formation of a governing coalition between the two parties, but could not agree regarding the members of a government cabinet, most importantly the prime minister. The M5S and League leaders met with Mattarella on 14 May to guide the formation of a new government.[103] At their meeting with Mattarella, both parties asked for an additional week of negotiations to agree on a detailed government program, as well as a prime minister to lead the joint government.[104][105] Both the M5S and the League asked their respective members to vote on the government agreement by the weekend.[106]\n\n\nOn 21 May, a private law professor, Giuseppe Conte, was proposed by Di Maio and Salvini for the role of Prime Minister of Italy.[107][108][109] Despite reports in the Italian press suggesting that Mattarella still had significant reservations about the direction of the new government,[110] Conte was invited to the Quirinal Palace on 23 May to receive the presidential mandate to form a new cabinet.[111][112] In the traditional statement after the appointment, Conte said that he would be the \"defense lawyer of Italian people\".[113]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mattarella with Giuseppe Conte at the Quirinal Palace\nOn 27 May, Conte renounced his mandate due to conflicts between Salvini and Mattarella. Salvini had proposed university professor Paolo Savona as Italian Minister of Economy and Finances, but Mattarella strongly opposed the appointment, considering Savona too Eurosceptic and anti-German.[114] In his speech after Conte's resignation, Mattarella declared that the two parties wanted to bring Italy out of the eurozone and that, as the guarantor of the Italian constitution and the country's interest and stability, he could not allow this. Mattarella subsequently gave economist Carlo Cottarelli the presidential mandate to form a new government.[115][116][117]\n\n\nMattarella's decision prompted furious reactions from the M5S, who called for Mattarella's impeachment, a move also supported by opposition party Brothers of Italy.[118] The League did not support this action.[119] Calls for impeachment were strongly criticized by Italian and international press. Luciano Fontana (editor of *Corriere della Sera*) defended Mattarella and said that \"Di Maio and Salvini are responsible for this crisis\", while Mario Calabresi (editor of *la Repubblica*) dismissed impeachment proposals as \"delirious\", and *La Stampa* called Di Maio and Meloni's proposal \"extremely irresponsible\".[120] *HuffPost* editor Lucia Annunziata dismissed Di Maio and Salvini as \"liars\",[121] while news magazine *L'Espresso* called them \"subversive\", and *Le Monde* praised Mattarella as an \"intransigent guardian of the Constitution\".[122] The president was also defended by *The Guardian*, *Libération*, and *Der Spiegel*.[123] German business newspaper *Handelsblatt* titled \"Forza Mattarella!\" (\"Go Mattarella!\")[124] Marco Travaglio and Maurizio Belpietro (editors of *Il Fatto Quotidiano* and *La Verità*) criticized Mattarella's move as an abuse but recognized that it was not sufficient to start an impeachment procedure.[125][126] After a few days, the M5S and the League agreed not to propose Savona as finance minister; on 31 May, Conte received again the presidential mandate to form the new cabinet.[127] The new government was sworn in on 1 June.[128]\n\n\n\n#### Political crises of 2019 and 2021[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2019 Italian government crisis and 2021 Italian government crisis\n\n![](image)President Mattarella during the August 2019 consultations\nIn August 2019, Deputy Prime Minister Salvini launched a motion of no confidence against Conte, after growing tensions within the majority.[129] Many political analysts believe the no-confidence motion was an attempt to force early elections to improve Lega's standing in the Italian Parliament, ensuring that Salvini would become the next prime minister.[130] On 20 August, following the parliamentary debate in which Conte accused Salvini of being a political opportunist who \"had triggered the political crisis only to serve his personal interest\",[131] the prime minister resigned his post to President Mattarella.[132] On the following day, Mattarella started the consultations with parliamentary groups.[133]\n\n\nDuring the round of consultations between Mattarella and the parliamentary groups, a possible new majority emerged, between the M5S and the Democratic Party (PD).[134] On 28 August, the PD's leader Nicola Zingaretti favored keeping Conte at the head of the new government.[135] On the following day, Mattarella received Conte to give him the task of forming a new cabinet.[136] On 4 September, Conte introduced his new cabinet, which was sworn in at the Quirinal Palace on the following day.[137] On 9 September 2019, the Chamber of Deputies expressed its confidence in the government with 343 votes in favour, 263 against, and 3 abstentions.[138][139] On 10 September 2019, in the second vote of confidence in the Senate, 169 lawmakers voted in favour of the new government and 133 voted against.[140]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mattarella and Mario Draghi at the Quirinal Palace in February 2021\nIn January 2021, Matteo Renzi, former prime minister and leader of Italia Viva (IV), who split from the PD in 2019, revoked his party's support to the government of Conte, who did not resign immediately.[141] On 18 and 19 January, Renzi's party abstained and the government won the key confidence votes in the Chamber and in the Senate but failed in reaching an absolute majority in the Senate.[142] On 26 January, Prime Minister Conte resigned from his office, prompting President Mattarella to start consultations for the formation of a new government.[143]\n\n\nIn February, when the consultations for the formation of a Conte's third government failed, Mattarella gave Mario Draghi, former president of the European Central Bank, the task of forming a government of national unity.[144][145][146] On 3 February, Draghi accepted with reservation the task of forming a new cabinet and started the consultations with the presidents of the two houses.[147]\n\n\nAfter successful negotiations with parties including FI, the League, the M5S, and the PD, Draghi was sworn in as the prime minister on 13 February,[148] pledging to oversee effective implementation of COVID-19 economic stimulus.[149] Draghi's government has been described as both a national unity government[150] and \"president's government\", a cabinet sponsored by and implemented by Mattarella.[151]\n\n\n\n#### COVID-19 pandemic[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: COVID-19 pandemic in Italy and COVID-19 lockdowns in Italy\n\nDuring Mattarella's presidency, Italy was hit by a major outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. In February 2020, Italy became one of the countries with the highest number of confirmed cases of COVID-19.[152] As of September 2023[update], there have been more than 25 million COVID-19 cases confirmed and more than 190,000 deaths; the pandemic mainly started in Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, Piedmont, and Veneto[153] but then spread through the whole country.[154][155]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mattarella wearing a protective mask at the Victor Emmanuel II Monument during the Liberation Day in April 2020\nOn 22 February, the Council of Ministers introduced a bill to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, quarantining more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in Northern Italy. After few days, schools and universities closed in the whole country.[156] On 8 March, the Italian government extended the quarantine to the entire region of Lombardy and 14 other northern provinces, putting more than a quarter of the national population under pandemic lockdown.[157] On the following day, the government extended the quarantine measures previously applied only in the so-called \"red zones\" to the whole country, putting *de facto* 60 million people in lockdown.[158][159] At the time of its application,[160] this measure was described as the largest lockdown in human history.[161][162][163]\nOn 18 May, the lockdown officially ended and the government allowed the re-openings of bars, restaurants, barbers and gyms.[164] The possibility to travel between different regions was restored on 3 June.[165]\n\n\nStarting from July, many countries in Europe, including Italy, witnessed a new rise in detected COVID-19 cases.[166][167] On 7 October, the parliament postponed the end of the state of emergency to 31 January 2021, and Prime Minister Conte imposed the use of protection mask outdoors.[168] On 13 October 2020, the Italian government reintroduced stricter rules to limit the spread of COVID-19.[169] Demonstrations and gatherings of people were strictly forbidden.[170] Regions and municipalities were given the power to only tighten but not release containment measures.[171] On 25 October, the government introduced new restrictions, imposing the closing of gyms, swimming pools, theatres, and cinemas, as well as the closing of bars and restaurants by 6 pm.[172] Restrictions were later confirmed until April 2021 by the new government led by Mario Draghi.[173]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mattarella on 31 December 2021 during the last speech of his first term as president\nOn 15 March 2021, Prime Minister Draghi placed the majority of Italy under so-called \"full lockdown\" conditions, with non-essential businesses closing and travel restricted, in response to an increase in the transmission of COVID-19; unlike the 2020 lockdown, factories and some other workplaces were allowed to remain open. Draghi vowed that Italy would see its vaccination programme triple in April, reaching 500,000 people per day by that time.[174]\n\n\nIn June 2021, the more contagious SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant became predominant in Italy.[175][176][177] In August 2021, the government extended the requirement of the EU Digital COVID Certificate, also known as Green Pass, to the participation in sports events and music festivals but also to the access to indoor places like bars, restaurants and gyms, as well as to long-distance public transportation, in an attempt to contain the spread of new variants.[178] On 15 October, Italy became the first country in the world to establish a mandatory COVID-19 vaccination certificate for the entire work force, public, and private.[179]\n\n\nOn 31 December, during what was anticipated to be his last speech to the nation as president and within a dramatic increasing in COVID-19 cases, Mattarella thanked all the Italians who got vaccinated, stressing that \"wasting vaccines was an offense to anyone who didn't have them\".[180] Mattarella also stated that during his seven-year term he never felt alone, thanking Italians to have shown \"the best face of the country\".[181]\n\n\n\n### Second term (2022–present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)President Mattarella and Prime Minister Mario Draghi at the Victor Emmanuel II Monument on the inauguration day\nDuring 2021, despite high popularity amid the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy,[182][183][184] President Mattarella refused to run for a second term despite various political forces asking him to do so, recalling similar remarks made by his predecessors Antonio Segni and Giovanni Leone.[185][186] Despite his firm denial, Mattarella received several votes in the ballots, notably reaching 336 votes in the sixth ballot and 387 in the seventh one, even if no major party or coalition formally supported him as a candidate.[187] On the morning of 29 January, after all other possible candidacies failed and the two major coalitions could not agree on a shared candidate, the re-election of incumbent president Mattarella became a serious alternative.[188][189] On the same day, Mattarella agreed to serve a second term,[190] and was re-elected with 759 votes,[191] as most party leaders and Prime Minister Mario Draghi asked him to accept their joint nomination for another term.[192][193][194]\n\n\nOn 3 February, President Mattarella was sworn in for his second term in front of a joint assembly of the parliament. He called for unity, saying: \"We still need to work together to strengthen Italy, beyond the current difficulties.\" He also commented on the Russo-Ukrainian crisis, stating: \"We cannot accept that now, without even the pretext of competition between different political and economic systems, the winds of confrontation are once again blowing across a continent that has experienced the tragedies of the First and Second World Wars.\"[195] Mattarella added: \"We must appeal to our resources and those of allied and friendly countries so that the displays of strength give way to mutual understanding so that no people should fear aggression from their neighbours.\"[196] Following the invasion of the country, Mattarella strongly condemned Vladimir Putin's decision to attack Ukraine, describing the invasion as a \"brutal war\"[197] and a \"nineteenth-century-like attack that evoked frightening scenarios, with humanity as the protagonist of its own ruin\".[198]\n\n\n\n#### 2022 government crisis[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 Italian government crisis\n\n![](image)Mattarella dissolving the Parliament following Draghi's resignation\nOn 13 July 2022, M5S abstained during the confidence vote on the *decreto aiuti* (English: aid decree), a bill that introduced stimulus to contrast the ongoing energy crisis.[199][200] On the following day, the M5S left the Senate floor during the voting process, *de facto* opening a government crisis within the Draghi's cabinet.[201] Following the M5S's abstention, Prime Minister Draghi consulted with President Mattarella about the crisis and, after a few hours, he formally resigned as Prime Minister citing a lack of political trust and confidence within the government's majority.[202] However, Mattarella rejected the resignation because the government had largely won the confidence vote in the Senate and invited the prime minister to address the Parliament, explaining the political situation.[203][204]\n\n\nOn 20 July, the government failed to reach the absolute majority in the confidence vote as Lega, FI and M5S decided not to take part in the ballot, *de facto* causing the fall of the government.[205][206][207] On the following day, after a speech in front of the Chamber of Deputies, Draghi officially resigned as prime minister.[208] Mattarella accepted his resignation, but Draghi remained in office as caretaker prime minister until the formation of the Meloni government following a snap general election.[209][210] On the same day, Mattarella summoned Draghi, Roberto Fico and Elisabetta Casellati to the Quirinal Palace and then dissolved the Parliament.[211] In a brief speech to the nation, Mattarella stated: \"Pauses are not possible at the moment we are going through: energy costs have consequences for families and businesses, economic difficulties must be addressed, there are many obligations to be closed in the interest of Italy.\"[212]\n\n\n\n#### 2022 general election and government formation[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2022 Italian general election and 2022 Italian government formation\n\n![](image)Mattarella with Giorgia Meloni during a military parade in 2023\nThe 2022 general election, held on 25 September, was characterized by a strong showing of the centre-right coalition led by Giorgia Meloni's Brothers of Italy (FdI), which won an absolute majority of seats in the Italian Parliament.[213] On 20 October, a few days after the elections of the presidents of the two houses of Parliament, Ignazio La Russa of FdI on 13 October for the Senate of the Republic, and Lorenzo Fontana of the League on 14 October for the Chamber of Deputies,[214][215] Mattarella officially launched consultations on the formation of a new cabinet.[216]\n\n\nOn the following day, the centre-right coalition formally proposed Meloni as its candidate to the premiership. In the afternoon, Mattarella summoned Meloni to the Quirinal Palace and gave her the task of forming a new cabinet. The Cabinet was announced on 21 October and was officially sworn in on 22 October.[217][218] It was one of the fastest government formations in the history of the Italian Republic.[219] Meloni became the first woman to serve as Prime Minister of Italy.[220][221]\n\n\nIn February 2023, Mattarella officially asked the government to modify the law regarding beach concessions in Italy, which was considered against both the European law and the opinion of the Italian Council of State.[222] He also criticised the so-called *Milleproroghe* (English: Thousand extensions), a decree law promoted by the government aimed at resolving urgent provisions by the end of the current year and described by Mattarella as a \"mere container of the most different regulatory interventions\".[223]\n\n\n\n## Personal life and public image[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mattarella celebrating during the UEFA Euro 2020 final\nMattarella married Marisa Chiazzese, daughter of Lauro Chiazzese, a professor of Roman law and rector of the University of Palermo, in 1966; his brother Piersanti was married to Marisa's sister Irma. Mattarella and his wife have three children:[224][225] Laura (born 1967), Bernardo Giorgio (1968),[226] and Francesco (1973). Marisa Chiazzese died from a tumor in 2012.[224] Their daughter Laura has acted as *de facto* First Lady,[227] accompanying her father on official trips outside Italy.[228][229] Mattarella is a Roman Catholic.\n\n\nBest known for its involvement in politics, Mattarella's family has held various national and regional offices spanning across two generations. His father Bernardo was a member of the Constituent Assembly and served as minister in various governments from 1953 until 1963. His brother Piersanti was murdered in 1980 in Sicily by *Cosa Nostra* while serving as president of the Regional Government of Sicily.[230] Another brother, Antonio, was managing director of the Investment Banking division of Goldman Sachs from 2005 to 2017.[231][232]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mattarella taking a selfie with Gianni Morandi, Chiara Ferragni, Amadeus and his daughter Laura, before Sanremo Music Festival 2023\nMattarella is an association football fan and a supporter of Inter Milan.[233] As head of state, he attended the UEFA Euro 2020, which included Italy as one of the hosts, and the UEFA Euro 2020 Final at Wembley Stadium on 11 July 2021, which was won by Italy, beating England on penalty kicks following a 1–1 draw after extra time.[234] On the following day, he hosted the national team at the Quirinal Palace to celebrate.[235]\n\n\nAt the end of his first term, Mattarella's approval rating was among the highest ever for an Italian president and the highest among Western world leaders.[236] According to the polling firm Ixè, Mattarella's approval rating in December 2021 was at 77%,[237] while it stood at 66% according to SWG[238] and 65% according to Quorum–YouTrend.[239] In February 2023, one year after his re-election as president, his approval rating was still very high, remaining at 77% according to Ixè and 65% for Quorum–YouTrend.[240][241]\n\n\nOn 7 February 2023, Mattarella became the first president to attend the Sanremo Music Festival.[242]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Election\n | House\n |

He served as the 22nd Prime Minister of Luxembourg from 2013 to 2023. He was a member of the Chamber of Deputies (1999–2013) and Mayor of Luxembourg City (2011–2013).[1][2]\n\n\nBettel is a member of the Democratic Party (DP).[3] Following the 2013 general election, he took office as Prime Minister and succeeded Jean-Claude Juncker of the Christian Social People's Party (CSV). Bettel became the first openly gay prime minister in the world to serve a second term in 2018, when his mandate was renewed. He was appointed Deputy Prime Minister in 2023 in the Frieden-Bettel Government.[4][5]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nBettel was born on 3 March 1973 in Luxembourg City. His father, Claude Bettel, was a wine merchant.[6] Bettel said he has an Orthodox Russian grandfather and a Polish-Jewish grandfather, while his parents were Catholics.[7] His mother Aniela is a grandniece of the Russian composer Sergei Rachmaninoff.[8] After completing his secondary school studies at Lycée Hélène Boucher in Thionville,[9] Bettel obtained a master's degree in Public and European Law and a DEA in Political Science and Public Law from Nancy 2 University in Nancy, France.[10][11] He also studied maritime law as well as canon law at Aristotle University in Thessaloniki, Greece, where he was studying thanks to the Erasmus Programme.[12] For four years in the early 2000s he hosted *Sonndes em 8*, a weekly talkshow, on the now-defunct private T.TV television network.[13][14] In 2017, he also received an Honorary doctorate from Sacred Heart University Luxembourg.[15][16]\n\n\n\n## Political career[edit]\n\n\n### Municipal politics[edit]\n\n\nIn the elections of 1999, Bettel was elected to Luxembourg City's communal council, finishing sixth on the DP's list. Two years after his election to the local council, on 12 July 2001, he was certified as a lawyer.[2] On 28 November 2005, after the municipal elections in which he was placed fourth on the DP list, Bettel was appointed *échevin* (alderman) in the council of Luxembourg City.[2]\n\n\nFollowing municipal elections on 9 October 2011, Bettel was sworn in as Mayor of Luxembourg on 24 November 2011. He resigned from his position as DP leader in the Chamber of Deputies, which he had held since 2009.[17][18]\n\n\n\n### National politics[edit]\n\n\nBettel ran for the Chamber of Deputies in the 1999 general election; he finished tenth amongst DP candidates in the Centre constituency, with the top seven being elected.[19] However, the DP overtook the Luxembourg Socialist Workers' Party (LSAP) as the second-largest party; its members formed the majority of the new government as the Christian Social People's Party's (CSV) coalition partners. Thus, with Lydie Polfer and Anne Brasseur vacating their seats to take roles in the government, as well as Colette Flesch not taking her seat so as to focus on her role as Member of the European Parliament (MEP), Bettel was appointed to the Chamber of Deputies, starting 12 August 1999.[2]\n\n\nBy the time of the 2004 general election, Bettel had significantly consolidated his position; he finished fourth (of the five DP members elected), assuring him a seat in the Chamber of Deputies.[20]\n\n\n\n### Prime Minister[edit]\n\n\n#### First term[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Xavier Bettel with Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov in Sofia on 16 May 2018\nIn 2013, Bettel was elected leader of the Democratic Party. In the 2013 general election, he led the party to a third-ranked position in parliamentary seats. On 25 October, Bettel was designated by Grand Duke Henri as the formateur for the next government.[21] He assumed his post as Luxembourg's Prime Minister on 4 December 2013. In the government's coalition of the Democratic Party (DP), Luxembourg Socialist Workers' Party (LSAP) and The Greens, he led the cabinet with co-Deputy Prime Ministers Etienne Schneider and Félix Braz. In his first term, he also held the functions of Minister of State, Minister for Communications and the Media, Minister for Culture and Minister for Religious Affairs.[2]\n\n\n\n#### Second term[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bettel and US Ambassador Randy Evans at the Luxembourg American Cemetery and Memorial, for the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge, on 16 December 2019\n![](image)Xavier Bettel with Slovenian Prime Minister Robert Golob in Ljubljana on 22 February 2023\nFollowing the 2018 election, he became the first openly gay prime minister in the world to be reelected for a second term. He began his second term when his government was formed on 5 December 2018,[22] which he currently leads with co-Deputy Prime Ministers François Bausch and Dan Kersch. The government is a continuation between the Democratic Party, the Luxembourg Socialist Workers' Party and The Greens from the Bettel I government, with minor changes.\n\n\nOn 16 September 2019, following a short bilateral meeting on the status of Brexit negotiations, Bettel continued a press conference without British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, after Johnson abruptly pulled out due to an anti-Brexit protest held by British citizens living in Luxembourg.[23] Bettel gestured towards Johnson's empty podium and confirmed that the UK Government had not tabled any concrete proposals for amendments to the UK's Withdrawal Agreement, particularly the \"Irish backstop\" that Johnson wished to replace.[24] This being despite the public pronouncements of Prime Minister Johnson and the UK's departure date from the EU fast approaching.[24] Pro-Brexit UK media reported the matter as an ambush,[25] whilst other UK and international media outlets largely saw the incident, as well as the reaction of pro-Brexit UK media outlets to it, as confirming the increasing hypersensitivity of pro-Brexit pundits and politicians to criticism.[23][24][26][27][28][29]\n\n\nOn 29 February 2020, all of Luxembourg's public transport became free of charge as a result of the Bettel II government coalition agreement.[30]\n\n\n\n### Deputy Prime Minister[edit]\n\n\nBettel was appointed Deputy Prime Minister in the Frieden-Bettel Government, after the coalition lost the 2023 election and only gained 29 seats. A new coalition government emerged between the CSV and DP, in which Luc Frieden is the Prime Minister.\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nBettel, who is openly gay,[31] has stated that increasingly in Luxembourg \"people do not consider the fact of whether someone is gay or not\". Bettel was Luxembourg's first openly gay Prime Minister. Worldwide, he was the third openly gay head of government following Iceland's Prime Minister Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir (2009–2013) and Belgium's Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo (2011–2014).[32] He was one of four openly gay world leaders in office, the other being Ana Brnabić, the Prime Minister of Serbia, Leo Varadkar, the Taoiseach of Ireland, and Edgars Rinkēvičs, the President of Latvia.\n\n\nBettel has been married to Gauthier Destenay since 2015,[33] the same year that same-sex marriage was introduced to Luxembourg.[34][35]\n\n\n\n### COVID-19 hospitalisation[edit]\n\n\nOn 4 July 2021, Bettel was admitted to hospital following a COVID-19 diagnosis on 27 June. The move was initially described as precautionary and for tests. It was reported that he experienced \"mild symptoms\" such as high temperature and headache.[36] The following day, it was reported that he was in a \"serious but stable\" condition and would remain hospitalised.[37] On 7 July 2021, the government said that Bettel would remain hospitalised a \"little bit longer\" due to low saturation of oxygen in his blood and that he was recovering \"little by little\".[38] On 8 July 2021, Bettel was discharged from hospital. It was announced he would resume activities soon via remote work for the rest of his isolation period. Bettel thanked health authorities for the treatment during his hospitalisation period.[39][40]\n\n\n\n## Honours and awards[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Award or decoration | Country | Date\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Ribbon\n | Name\n |\n| ![](image) | Order of Civil Merit | ![](image) Spain | 2007[*citation needed*] |\n| ![](image) | Order of Orange-Nassau (Knight Grand Officer) | ![](image) Netherlands | 2012[*citation needed*] |\n| ![](image) | Order of the Oak Crown (Knight Grand cross) | ![](image) Luxembourg | 2014[41][42] |\n| ![](image) | Order of the Legion of Honour (Commander) | ![](image) France | 2015[*citation needed*] |\n| ![](image) | Order of the Crown (Knight Grand Cross) | ![](image) Belgium | 2017[43] |\n| ![](image) | Order of Prince Henry (Grand Cross) | ![](image) Portugal | 2017[44] |\n| ![](image) | Order of the Cross of Terra Mariana (Grand Cross) | ![](image) Estonia | 2018[45] |\n| ![](image) | Order of Orange-Nassau (Knight Grand Cross) | ![](image) Netherlands | 2018[*citation needed*] |\n| ![](image) | Order of the Republic of Serbia[46] (Grand Cross with Collar, Serbia's highest award) | ![](image) Serbia | 2020\n |\n| ![GRE Order of Honour Grand Cross BAR](image) | Order of Honour (Grand Cross)\n | ![](image) Greece | 2023[47] |\n\n\n## Allegations of plagiarism[edit]\n\n\n\"In his thesis at the University of Nancy there is not one correct reference,\" wrote Pol Reuter with reference to research by Reporter.lu. The master's thesis, submitted in 1999, is dedicated to the topic of electoral reform at the European Parliament. Allegedly, only two of the total 56 pages were free of plagiarism. The plagiarism findings are said to have been confirmed by several independent researchers.[48] Bettel stated he wrote this thesis with a clear conscience, although \"from today’s standpoint, it could have – yes, maybe should have – been done differently.\" He also stated he would accept the findings of the University of Lorraine on the matter.[49]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Bettel I (2013–2018)\n* Bettel II (2018–2023)\n* List of openly LGBT heads of government\n* List of the first LGBT holders of political offices\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Xavier Bettel\".

Until his accession to the throne, he was a member of the International Olympic Committee (1998–2013),[1] chairman of the Advisory Committee on Water to the Dutch Minister of Infrastructure and the Environment (2004–2013),[2] and chairman of the Secretary-General of the United Nations' Advisory Board on Water and Sanitation (2006–2013).[3][4]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Prince Willem-Alexander (left) at age 14 and his brother Friso in 1982\nWillem-Alexander Claus George Ferdinand was born on 27 April 1967 at the Utrecht University Hospital (now known as the University Medical Center Utrecht) in Utrecht, Netherlands. He is the first child of Princess Beatrix and Prince Claus,[5] and the first grandchild of Queen Juliana and Prince Bernhard. He was the first male Dutch royal baby since the birth of Prince Alexander in 1851, and the first immediate male heir since Alexander's death in 1884.\n\n\nFrom birth, Willem-Alexander has held the titles Prince of the Netherlands (Dutch: *Prins der Nederlanden*), Prince of Orange-Nassau (Dutch: *Prins van Oranje-Nassau*), and Jonkheer of Amsberg (Dutch: *Jonkheer van Amsberg*).[5] He was baptised as a member of the Dutch Reformed Church[6] on 2 September 1967[7] in Saint Jacob's Church in The Hague.[8] His godparents are his maternal grandfather Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld, his paternal grandmother Gösta Freiin von dem Bussche-Haddenhausen, Prince Ferdinand von Bismarck, former Prime Minister Jelle Zijlstra, Jonkvrouw Renée Röell, and Queen Margrethe II of Denmark.[7]\n\n\nHe had two younger brothers: Prince Friso (1968–2013) and Prince Constantijn (born in 1969). He lived with his family at the castle Drakensteyn in the hamlet Lage Vuursche near Baarn from his birth until 1981, when they moved to the larger palace Huis ten Bosch in The Hague. His mother, Beatrix, became Queen of the Netherlands in 1980, after his grandmother Juliana abdicated. He then received the title of Prince of Orange as heir apparent to the throne of the Kingdom of the Netherlands at the age of 13.[5]\n\n\nWillem-Alexander attended local state primary school Nieuwe Baarnse Elementary School in Baarn from 1973 to 1979. He went to two different state secondary schools: the Baarns Lyceum in Baarn from 1979 to 1981 and the Eerste Vrijzinnig Christelijk Lyceum in The Hague from 1981 to 1983, and the private sixth-form college United World College of the Atlantic in Wales, the UK (1983 to 1985), from which he received his International Baccalaureate.[5][9]\n\n\nAfter his military service from 1985 to 1987, Willem-Alexander studied History at Leiden University from 1987 onwards and received his MA degree (*doctorandus*) in 1993.[10][11] His final thesis was on the Dutch response to France's decision under President Charles de Gaulle to leave NATO's integrated command structure.[5]\n\n\nWillem-Alexander speaks English, Spanish, French and German (his father's native language, despite never getting German language lessons from him) fluently in addition to his native Dutch.[12]\n\n\n\n## Military training and career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Willem-Alexander in the navy uniform of ensign in 1986\nBetween secondary school and his university education, Willem-Alexander performed military service in the Royal Netherlands Navy from August 1985 until January 1987. He received his training at the Royal Netherlands Naval College and the frigates HNLMS *Tromp* and HNLMS *Abraham Crijnssen*, where he was an ensign. In 1988 he received additional training at the ship HNLMS *Van Kinsbergen* and became a lieutenant (junior grade) (*wachtofficier*).[13]\n\n\nAs a reservist for the Royal Netherlands Navy, Willem-Alexander was promoted to lieutenant commander in 1995, commander in 1997, Captain at Sea in 2001, and commodore in 2005. As a reservist for the Royal Netherlands Army, he was made a major (Grenadiers' and Rifles Guard Regiment) in 1995, and was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1997, colonel in 2001, and brigadier general in 2005. As a reservist for the Royal Netherlands Air Force, he was made squadron leader in 1995 and promoted to air commodore in 2005. As a reservist for the Royal Marechaussee, he was made brigadier general in 2005.[9]\n\n\nBefore his investiture as king in 2013, Willem-Alexander was honourably discharged from the armed forces. The government declared that the head of state cannot be a serving member of the armed forces, since the government itself holds supreme command over the armed forces. As king, Willem-Alexander may choose to wear a military uniform with royal insignia, but not with his former rank insignia.[14]\n\n\n\n## Activities and social interests[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Prince Willem-Alexander and Princess Máxima meet Michelle Obama, Barack Obama and Fay Hartog-Levin at the White House in 2009.\nSince 1985, when he became 18 years old, Willem-Alexander has been a member of the Council of State of the Netherlands. This is the highest council of the Dutch political system and is chaired by the head of state (then Queen Beatrix).[15]\n\n\nWillem-Alexander is interested in water management and sports issues. He was an honorary member of the World Commission on Water for the 21st century and patron of the Global Water Partnership, a body established by the World Bank, the UN, and the Swedish Ministry of Development. He was appointed as the Chairperson of the United Nations Secretary General's Advisory Board on Water and Sanitation on 12 December 2006.[16]\n\n\nOn 10 October 2010, Willem-Alexander and Máxima went to the Netherlands Antilles' capital, Willemstad, to attend and represent his mother, the Queen, at the Antillean Dissolution ceremony.\n\n\nHe was a patron of the Dutch Olympic Games Committee until 1998 when he was made a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). After becoming King, he relinquished his membership and received the Gold Olympic Order at the 125th IOC Session.[17] To celebrate the 100th anniversary of the 1928 Summer Olympics held in Amsterdam, he had expressed support to bid for the 2028 Summer Olympics.[18]\n\n\nHe was a member of the supervisory board of De Nederlandsche Bank (the Dutch central bank), a member of the Advisory Council of ECP (the information society forum for government, business and civil society), patron of Veterans' Day and held several other patronages and posts.[19]\n\n\n\n## Reign[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Inauguration of Willem-Alexander\n\nOn 28 January 2013, Beatrix announced her intention of abdicating. On the morning of 30 April 2013, Beatrix signed the instrument of abdication at the *Moseszaal* (Moses Hall) at the Royal Palace of Amsterdam. Later that afternoon, Willem-Alexander was inaugurated as king in front of the joint assembly of the States General in a ceremony held at the Nieuwe Kerk.\n\n\nAs king, Willem-Alexander has weekly meetings with the prime minister and speaks regularly with ministers and state secretaries. He also signs all new Acts of Parliament and royal decrees. He represents the kingdom at home and abroad. At the State Opening of Parliament, he delivers the Speech from the Throne, which announces the plans of the government for the parliamentary year. The Constitution requires that the king appoint, dismiss and swear in all government ministers and state secretaries. As king, he is also the President of the Council of State, an advisory body that reviews proposed legislation. In modern practice, the monarch seldom chairs council meetings.[20]\n\n\nAt his accession at age 46, he was Europe's youngest monarch. On the inauguration of Spain's Felipe VI on 19 June 2014, he became, and remains, Europe's second-youngest monarch. He is also the first male monarch of the Netherlands since the death of his great-great-grandfather William III in 1890. Willem-Alexander was one of four new monarchs to take the throne in 2013 along with Pope Francis, the Emir Tamim bin Hamad of Qatar, and King Philippe of Belgium.\n\n\n\n## Other activities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Willem-Alexander with his family at the 2012 Summer Olympics, here supporting Ellen van Dijk\nWillem-Alexander is an avid pilot and has said that if he had not been a royal, he would have liked to be an airline pilot so he could fly internationally on large-sized aircraft such as the Boeing 747.[21] During the reign of his mother, he regularly flew the Dutch royal aircraft on trips.[22] However, in May 2017, Willem-Alexander revealed that he had served as a first officer on KLM flights for 21 years, flying KLM Cityhopper's Fokker 70s twice a month, even after his accession to the throne. Following KLM's phased retirement of the Fokker 70, he began training to fly Boeing 737s. Willem-Alexander was rarely recognized while in the KLM uniform and wearing the KLM cap, though a few passengers recognized his voice, even though he never gave his name and only welcomed passengers on behalf of the captain and crew.[21][23]\n\n\nUsing the name \"W. A. van Buren\", one of the least-known titles of the House of Orange-Nassau, he participated in the 1986 Frisian Elfstedentocht, a 200-kilometre-long (120 mi) distance ice skating tour.[24] He ran the New York City Marathon under the same pseudonym in 1992.[25] Willem-Alexander completed both events.\n\n\n\n## Marriage and children[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wedding of Willem-Alexander, Prince of Orange, and Máxima Zorreguieta Cerruti\n\n![](image)Prince Willem-Alexander and Princess Máxima kiss at the balcony of the Royal Palace of Amsterdam on their wedding day in 2002.\nOn 2 February 2002, he married Máxima Zorreguieta Cerruti at the Nieuwe Kerk in Amsterdam. The marriage triggered significant controversy due to the role the bride's father, Jorge Zorreguieta, had in the Argentinian military dictatorship. The couple have three daughters: The Princess of Orange, Princess Alexia, and Princess Ariane.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n![](image)King Willem-Alexander and Queen Máxima with their daughters Princess Catharina-Amalia (left), Princess Alexia (right) and Princess Ariane (center)\n\n\n| Name | Date of birth | Place of birth | Age\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Catharina-Amalia, Princess of Orange | (2003-12-07)7 December 2003 | The Hague, Netherlands | 20\n |\n| Princess Alexia of the Netherlands | (2005-06-26)26 June 2005 | The Hague, Netherlands | 18\n |\n| Princess Ariane of the Netherlands | (2007-04-10)10 April 2007 | The Hague, Netherlands | 17\n |\n\n\n## Privacy and the press[edit]\n\n\nIn an attempt to strike a balance between privacy for the royal family and availability to the press, the Netherlands Government Information Service (RVD) instituted a media code on 21 June 2005 which essentially states that:[26]\n\n\n\n* Photographs of the members of the royal house while performing their duties are always permitted.\n* For other occasions (like holidays or vacations), the RVD will arrange a photo-op on condition that the press leave the family alone for the rest of the activity.\n\n\nDuring a ski vacation in Argentina, several photographs were taken of the prince and his family during the private part of their holiday, including one by Associated Press staff photographer Natacha Pisarenko, in spite of the media code, and after a photo opportunity had been provided earlier.[27] The Associated Press decided to publish some of the photos, which were subsequently republished by several Dutch media. Willem-Alexander and the RVD jointly filed suit against the Associated Press on 5 August 2009, and the trial started on 14 August 2009 at the district court in Amsterdam. On 28 August 2009, the district court ruled in favour of the prince and RVD, citing that the couple has a right to privacy, that the pictures in question add nothing to any public debate, and that they are not of any particular value to society since they are not photographs of his family \"at work\". Associated Press was sentenced to stop further publication of the photographs, on pain of a €1,000 fine per violation with a €50,000 maximum.[28]\n\n\n\n## Properties[edit]\n\n\nFrom 2003 until 2019, Willem-Alexander and his family lived in Villa Eikenhorst on the De Horsten Estate in Wassenaar.[29] After his mother abdicated and became Princess Beatrix once again, she moved to the castle of Drakensteyn, after which the King and his family moved to the newly renovated monarch's palace of Huis ten Bosch in The Hague in 2019.[30]\n\n\nWillem-Alexander has a villa near Kranidi, Greece.[31]\n\n\n\n### Villa in Machangulo[edit]\n\n\nOn 10 July 2008, the Prince of Orange and Princess Maxima announced that they had invested in a development project on the Mozambican peninsula of Machangulo.[32] The development project was aimed at building an ecologically responsible vacation resort, including a hotel and several luxury holiday homes for investors. The project was to invest heavily in the local economy of the peninsula (building schools and a local clinic) with an eye both towards responsible sustainability and maintaining a local staff.[33] After contacting Mozambican President Armando Guebuza to verify that the Mozambican government had no objections, the couple decided to invest in two villas.[34] In 2009, controversy erupted in parliament and the press about the project and the prince's involvement.[34] Politician Alexander Pechtold questioned the morality of building such a resort in a poor country like Mozambique. After public and parliamentary controversy, the royal couple announced that they had decided to sell the property in Machangulo once their house was completed.[35] In January 2012, it was confirmed that the villa had been sold.[36]\n\n\n\n## Titles, styles, honours and arms[edit]\n\n\n### Titles and styles[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Style of the Dutch sovereign\n\n* 27 April 1967 – 30 April 1980: *His Royal Highness* Prince Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands, Prince of Orange-Nassau, Jonkheer van Amsberg\n* 30 April 1980 – 30 April 2013: *His Royal Highness* The Prince of Orange\n* 30 April 2013 – present: *His Majesty* the King[37]\n\n\nWillem-Alexander's full title is: His Majesty King Willem-Alexander, King of the Netherlands, Prince of Orange-Nassau, etc., etc., etc.[37]\n\n\nWillem-Alexander is the first Dutch king since Willem III (d. 1890).

of Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands\n| ![](image) | Notes\nAs Monarch, Willem-Alexander uses the **Greater Coat of Arms of the Realm** (*Grote Rijkswapen*). The components of the coats of arms were updated and further regulated by Queen Wilhelmina in a royal decree of 10 July 1907 and were affirmed by Queen Juliana in a royal decree of 23 April 1980.\nCrest\nIssuing from a coronet Or, a pair of wings joined Sable each with an arched bend Argent charged with three leaves of the lime-tree stems upward Vert.\nTorse\nAzure and Or\nHelm\nBarred helmet\nEscutcheon\nAzure, billetty Or a lion with a coronet Or armed and langued Gules holding in his dexter paw a sword Argent hilted Or and in the sinister paw seven arrows Argent pointed and bound together Or.\nSupporters\nTwo lions rampant Or armed and langued Gules\nMotto\n* **JE MAINTIENDRAI**\n* *French: I will maintain (in Dutch: *Ik zal handhaven*)*\n\nOther elements\nThe monarch places this coat of arms on a purple mantle, with golden borders and tassels, lined with Ermine. Above the mantle is a purple pavilion again topped with the royal crown.[62] (Note: Although the official blazon states the mantle as purple it often looks like (dark) red. French and German purple contains more red and less blue than American or British purple.)\nBanner\n![](image) Upon his succession to the throne, Willem-Alexander adopted the (partly modified) Royal Standard of the Netherlands, which is a square orange flag, divided in four-quarters by a nassau-blue cross. All quarters show a white and blue bugle-horn, taken from the coat of arms of the Principality of Orange. In the centre of the flag is the (small) coat of arms of the Kingdom, which originates from the arms of the House of Nassau, surmounted by a royal crown and surrounded by the insignia of the Grand Cross of the Military William Order.\nSymbolism\nThe seven arrows stand for the seven provinces of the Union of Utrecht.\nPrevious versions\n![](image) Quarterly, 1 and 3, Azure, billetty Or a lion with a coronet or armed and langued Gules holding in his dexter paw a sword Argent hilted Or and in the sinister paw seven arrows Argent pointed and bound together Or (royal arms of the Netherlands, i.e. that of his mother, Queen Beatrix), 2 and 4, Or, and a bugle-horn Azure, langued Gules (arms of the former Principality of Orange), on an inescutcheon Vert, a castle proper, on a mount of the last (arms of the House of Amsberg, i.e. that of his late father, Prince Claus). |\n\n\n## Ancestry[edit]\n\n\nThrough his father, a member of the House of Amsberg, he is descended from families of the lower German nobility, and through his mother, from several royal German–Dutch families such as the House of Lippe, Mecklenburg-Schwerin, the House of Orange-Nassau, Waldeck and Pyrmont, and the House of Hohenzollern. He is descended from the first king of the Netherlands, William I of the Netherlands, who was also a ruler in Luxembourg and several German states, and all subsequent Dutch monarchs.\n\n\nThrough his mother, Willem-Alexander also descends from Paul I of Russia and thus from German princess Catherine the Great and Swedish King Gustav I. Through his father, he is also descended from several Dutch–Flemish families who left the Low Countries during Spanish rule, such as the Berenbergs. His paternal great-great-grandfather Gabriel von Amsberg, a major-general of Mecklenburg, was recognized as noble as late as 1891, the family having adopted the \"von\" in 1795.[63][64]\n\n\nWillem-Alexander is a descendant of King George II and, more relevant for his succession rights, of his granddaughter Princess Augusta of Great Britain. Under the British Act of Settlement, King Willem-Alexander temporarily forfeited his (distant) succession rights to the throne of the United Kingdom by marrying a Roman Catholic. This right has since been restored in 2015 under the Succession to the Crown Act 2013.[65]\n\n\n\n| Ancestors of Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands |\n| --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 8.

Since 1870, the head of state has been the President of France. Below is a list of all French heads of state. It includes the monarchs of the Kingdom of France, emperors of the First and Second Empire and leaders of the five Republics. \n\n\n\n\n## Merovingian dynasty (509–751)[edit]\n\n\nThe Merovingians were a Salian Frankish dynasty that ruled the Franks for nearly 300 years in a region known as Francia in Latin, beginning in the middle of the 5th century CE. Their territory largely corresponded to ancient Gaul as well as the Roman provinces of Raetia, Germania Superior and the southern part of Germania. The Merovingian dynasty was founded by Childeric I (c. 457 – 481 CE), the son of Merovech, leader of the Salian Franks, but it was his famous son Clovis I (481–511 CE) who united all of Gaul under Merovingian rule.[1][2]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Portrait\n | Name\n | From\n | Until\n | Death\n | Relationship with his predecessors\n | Title\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | Clovis I (Clovis Ier) | 509\n | 511\n | Likely died of natural causes aged 46.

His sons Pepin and Carloman briefly restored the Merovingian dynasty by raising Childeric III to the throne in 743. In 751, Pepin deposed Childerich and acceded to the throne.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Portrait\n | Name\n | From\n | Until\n | Death\n | Relationship with his predecessors\n | Title\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | Childeric III (Childéric III) | 743\n | November 751\n | Died aged 37.\n |  • Son of Chilperic II or of Theuderic IV\n | King of the Franks (Roi des Francs) |\n\n\n## Carolingian dynasty (751–888)[edit]\n\n\nThe Carolingian dynasty was a Frankish noble family with origins in the Arnulfing and Pippinid clans of the 7th century AD. The family consolidated its power in the late 8th century, eventually making the offices of Mayor of the Palace and *dux et princeps Francorum* hereditary and becoming the *de facto* rulers of the Franks as the real powers behind the throne. By 751, the Merovingian dynasty, which until then had ruled the Germanic Franks by right, was deprived of this right with the consent of the Papacy and the aristocracy, and a Carolingian, Pepin the Short, was crowned King of the Franks.[3][2]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Portrait\n | Name\n | From\n | Until\n | Relationship with his predecessors\n | Title\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | Pepin *the Younger*, *the Short* (Pépin *le Bref*) | 751\n | 24 September 768\n |  • Son of Charles Martel | King of the Franks (Roi des Francs) |\n| ![](image) | Carloman I | 24 September 768\n | 4 December 771\n |  • Son of Pepin the Short\n | King of the Franks (Roi des Francs) |\n| ![](image) | Charlemagne (Charles I, *the Great*)\n | 24 September 768\n | 28 January 814\n |  • Son of Pepin the Short\n | King of the Franks (Roi des Francs) Emperor of the Romans (Imperator Romanorum) (800–814)\n |\n| ![](image) | Louis I *the Pious, the Debonaire* (Louis Ier *le Pieux, le Débonnaire*) | 28 January 814\n | 20 June 840\n |  • Son of Charlemagne\n | King of the Franks (Roi des Francs) Emperor of the Romans (Imperator Romanorum) |\n| ![](image) | Charles II *the Bald* (Charles II *le Chauve*) | 20 June 840\n | 6 October 877\n |  • Son of Louis I\n | King of the Franks (Roi des Francs) Emperor of the Romans (Imperator Romanorum)  (875–877)\n |\n| ![](image) | Louis II *the Stammerer* (Louis II *le Bègue*) | 6 October 877\n | 10 April 879\n |  • Son of Charles II\n | King of the Franks (Roi des Francs) |\n| ![](image) | Louis III | 10 April 879\n | 5 August 882\n |  • Son of Louis II\n | King of the Franks (Roi des Francs) |\n| ![](image) | Carloman II | 5 August 882\n | 6 December 884\n |  • Son of Louis II\n | King of the Franks (Roi des Francs) |\n| ![](image) | Charles III *the Fat* (Charles *le Gros*) | 20 May 885\n | 13 January 888\n |  • Son of Louis the German • Cousin of Louis II and Carloman II • Grandson of Louis I *the Pious* | King of the Franks (Roi des Francs) Emperor of the Romans (Imperator Romanorum)  (881–887)\n |\n\n\n## Robertian dynasty (888–898)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Robertian dynasty\n\nThe Robertians were Frankish noblemen owing fealty to the Carolingians, and ancestors of the subsequent Capetian dynasty.

The Capetian Dynasty, the male-line descendants of Hugh Capet, ruled France continuously from 987 to 1792 and again from 1814 to 1848. They were direct descendants of the Robertian kings. The cadet branches of the dynasty which ruled after 1328, however, are generally given the specific branch names of *Valois* and *Bourbon*.\n\n\nNot listed below are Hugh Magnus, eldest son of Robert II, and Philip of France, eldest son of Louis VI; both were co-Kings with their fathers (in accordance with the early Capetian practice whereby kings would crown their heirs in their own lifetimes and share power with the co-king), but predeceased them. Because neither Hugh nor Philip were sole or senior king in their own lifetimes, they are not traditionally listed as Kings of France, and are not given ordinals.\n\n\nHenry VI of England, son of Catherine of Valois, became titular King of France upon his grandfather Charles VI's death in accordance with the Treaty of Troyes of 1420 however this was disputed and he is not always regarded as a legitimate king of France.\n\n\nFrom 21 January 1793 to 8 June 1795, Louis XVI's son Louis-Charles was the titular King of France as Louis XVII; in reality, however, he was imprisoned in the Temple throughout this duration, and power was held by the leaders of the Republic. Upon Louis XVII's death, his uncle (Louis XVI's brother) Louis-Stanislas claimed the throne, as Louis XVIII, but only became *de facto* King of France in 1814.\n\n\n\n### House of Capet (987–1328)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: House of Capet\n\n\n\n| Portrait\n | Coat of arms\n | Name\n | From\n | Until\n | Relationship with his predecessors\n | Title\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) |  | Hugh Capet (Hugues Capet) | 3 July 987 | 24 October 996 |  • Grandson of Robert I[2] | King of the Franks (Roi des Francs) |\n| ![](image) |  | Robert II *the Pious, the Wise* (Robert II *le Pieux, le Sage*) | 24 October 996 | 20 July 1031 |  • Son of Hugh Capet\n | King of the Franks (Roi des Francs) |\n| ![](image) |  | Henry I(Henri Ier) | 20 July 1031 | 4 August 1060 |  • Son of Robert II\n | King of the Franks (Roi des Francs) |\n| ![](image) |  | Philip I *the Amorous*(Philippe Ier *l' Amoureux*) | 4 August 1060 | 29 July 1108 |  • Son of Henry I\n | King of the Franks (Roi des Francs) |\n| ![](image) |  | Louis VI *the Fat* (Louis VI *le Gros*) | 29 July 1108 | 1 August 1137 |  • Son of Philip I\n | King of the Franks (Roi des Francs) |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Louis VII *the Young* (Louis VII *le Jeune*) | 1 August 1137 | 18 September 1180 |  • Son of Louis VI\n | King of the Franks (Roi des Francs) |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Philip II *Augustus* (Philippe II *Auguste*) | 18 September 1180 | 14 July 1223 |  • Son of Louis VII\n | King of the Franks (Roi des Francs)first monarch to use the title of *King of France*(Roi de France) |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Louis VIII *the Lion* (Louis VIII *le Lion*) | 14 July 1223 | 8 November 1226 |  • Son of Philip II Augustus\n | King of France (Roi de France) |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Louis IX *the Saint* (Saint Louis) | 8 November 1226 | 25 August 1270 |  • Son of Louis VIII\n | King of France (Roi de France) |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Philip III *the Bold* (Philippe III *le Hardi*) | 25 August 1270 | 5 October 1285 |  • Son of Louis IX\n | King of France (Roi de France) |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Philip IV *the Fair*, *the Iron King* (Philippe IV *le Bel*) | 5 October 1285 | 29 November 1314 |  • Son of Philip III\n | King of France and of Navarre (Roi de France et de Navarre) |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Louis X *the Quarreller* (Louis X *le Hutin*) | 29 November 1314 | 5 June 1316 |  • Son of Philip IV\n | King of France and of Navarre (Roi de France et de Navarre) |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | John I *the Posthumous* (Jean Ier *le Posthume*) | 15 November 1316 | 20 November 1316 |  • Son of Louis X\n | King of France and of Navarre (Roi de France et de Navarre) |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Philip V *the Tall* (Philippe V *le Long*) | 20 November 1316 | 3 January 1322 |  • Son of Philip IV • Younger brother of Louis X\n | King of France and of Navarre (Roi de France et de Navarre) |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Charles IV *the Fair* (Charles IV *le Bel*) | 3 January 1322 | 1 February 1328 |  • Son of Philip IV • Younger brother of Louis X and Philip V\n | King of France and of Navarre (Roi de France et de Navarre) |\n\n\n### House of Valois (1328–1589)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: House of Valois\n\n\n\n| Portrait\n | Coat of arms\n | Name\n | From\n | Until\n | Relationship with his predecessors\n | Title\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Philip VI *of Valois*, *the Fortunate* (Philippe VI *de Valois*, *le Fortuné*) | 1 April 1328 | 22 August 1350 |  • Grandson of Philip III of France[6] | King of France (Roi de France) |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | John II *the Good* (Jean II *le Bon*) | 22 August 1350 | 8 April 1364 |  • Son of Philip VI\n | King of France (Roi de France) |\n| ![](image) | ![](image)![](image) | Charles V *the Wise* (Charles V *le Sage*) | 8 April 1364 | 16 September 1380 |  • Son of John II\n | King of France (Roi de France) |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Charles VI *the Beloved*, *the Mad* (Charles VI *le Bienaimé*, *le Fol*) | 16 September 1380 | 21 October 1422 |  • Son of Charles V\n | King of France (Roi de France) |\n\n\n### House of Lancaster (1422–1453), disputed[edit]\n\n\nMain article: House of Lancaster\n\nFrom 1340 to 1801 (but not from 1360 to 1369), the Kings of England and Great Britain claimed the title of King of France. Under the terms of the 1420 Treaty of Troyes, Charles VI had recognized his son-in-law Henry V of England as regent and heir. Henry V predeceased Charles VI and so Henry V's son, Henry VI, succeeded his grandfather Charles VI as King of France. Most of Northern France was under English control until 1435, but by 1453, the English had been expelled from all of France save Calais (and the Channel Islands), and Calais itself fell in 1558.

Historians generally divide the Convention's activities into three periods, moderate, radical, and reaction, and the policies of presidents of the Convention reflect these distinctions. During the radical and reaction phases, some of the presidents were executed, most by guillotine, committed suicide, or were deported. In addition, some of the presidents were later deported during the Bourbon Restoration in 1815.\n\n\n\n### Establishment of the Convention[edit]\n\n\nThe National Convention governed France from 20 September 1792 until 26 October 1795 during the most critical period of the French Revolution. The election of the National Convention took place in September 1792 after the election of the electoral colleges by primary regional assemblies on 26 August. Owing to the abstention of aristocrats and the anti-republicans, and the general fear of victimization, the voter turnout in the departments was low – as little as 7.5 percent or as much as 11.9% of the electorate, compared to 10.2% in the 1791 elections, despite the doubling of the number of eligible voters.[7]\n\n\nInitially elected to provide a new constitution after the overthrow of the monarchy on 10 August 1792, the Convention included 749 deputies drawn from businesses and trades, and from such professions as law, journalism, medicine, and the clergy. Among its earliest acts was the formal abolition of the monarchy, through Proclamation, on 21 September, and the subsequent establishment of the Republic on 22 September. The French Republican Calendar discarded all Christian reference points and calculated time from the Republic's first full day after the monarchy – 22 September 1792, the first day of Year One.[8][9]\n\n\nAccording to its own rules, the Convention elected its President every fortnight (two weeks). He was eligible for re-election after the lapse of a fortnight. Ordinarily the sessions were held in the morning, but evening sessions also occurred frequently, often extending late into the night. In exceptional circumstances, the Convention declared itself in permanent session and sat for several days without interruption. For both legislative and administrative deliberations, the Convention used committees, with powers more or less widely extended and regulated by successive laws.[10] The most famous of these committees included the Committee of Public Safety and the Committee of General Security.[9]\n\n\nThe Convention held both legislative and executive powers during the first years of the French First Republic and had three distinct periods: Girondins (moderate), Montagnard (radical) and Thermidorian (reaction). The Montagnards favored granting the poorer classes more political power; the Girondins favored a bourgeois republic and wanted to reduce the power and influence of Paris over the course of the revolution. A popular uprising in Paris helped to purge the Convention of the Girondins between 31 May and 2 June 1793;[9] the last of the Girondins served as presidents in late July.[11]\n\n\nIn its second phase, the Montagnards controlled the convention (June 1793 to July 1794). War and an internal rebellion convinced the revolutionary government to establish a Committee of Public Safety which exercised near dictatorial power. Consequently, the democratic constitution, approved by the convention on 24 June 1793, did not go into effect and the Convention lost its legislative initiative.[9] The rise of Mountaineers (Montagnards) corresponded with the decline of the Girondins. The Girondin party had hesitated on the correct course of action to take with Louis XVI after his attempt to flee France on 20 June 1791. Some elements of the Girondin party believed they could use the king as figurehead. While the Girondins hesitated, the Montagnards took a united stand during the trial in December 1792 – January 1793 and favored the king's execution.[12] Riding on this victory, the Montagnards then sought to discredit the Girondins using tactics previously used against themselves, denouncing the Girondins as liars and enemies of the Revolution.[13] The last quarter of the year was marked by the Reign of Terror (5 September 1793 – 28 July 1794),[14] also known as The Terror (French: *la Terreur*), a period of violence incited by conflict between these rival political factions, the Girondins and the Jacobins, and marked by mass executions of \"enemies of the revolution\". The death toll ranged in the tens of thousands, with 16,594 executed by guillotine (2,639 in Paris),[13] and another 25,000 in summary executions across France.[15] Most of the Parisian victims of the guillotine filled the Madeleine, Mosseaux (also called Errancis), and Picpus cemeteries.[16]\n\n\nIn the third phase, called Thermidor after the month in which it began, many of the members of the Convention overthrew the most prominent member of the committee, Maximilien Robespierre. This reaction to the radical influence of the Committee of Public Safety reestablished the balance of power in the hands of the moderate deputies. The Girondins who had survived the 1793 purge were recalled and the leading Montagnards were themselves purged, and many executed. In August 1795, the Convention approved the Constitution for the regime that replaced it, the bourgeois-dominated Directory, which exercised power from 1795 to 1799, when a coup d'etat by Napoleon Bonaparte overthrew it.[9]\n\n\n\n### Moderate Phase: September 1792 – June 1793[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Girondin and The Plain\n\nInitially, *La Marais*, or The Plain, a moderate, amorphous group, controlled the Convention. At the first session, held on 20 September 1792, the elder statesman Philippe Rühl presided over the session. The following day, amidst profound silence, the proposition was put to the assembly, \"*That royalty be abolished in France*\"; it carried, with cheers. On the 22nd came the news of the Republic's victory at the Battle of Valmy. On the same day, the Convention decreed that \"in future, the acts of the assembly shall be dated *First Year of the French Republic*\". Three days later, the Convention added the corollary of \"*the French republic is one and indivisible*\", to guard against federalism.[17]\n\n\nThe following men were elected for two-week terms as Presidents, or executives, of the Convention.[18]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Image\n | Dates\n | Name\n | Fate\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | 20 September 1792 | Philippe Rühl | Suicide, 29/30 May 1795\n |\n| ![](image) | 20 September 1792  – 4 October 1792 | Jérôme Pétion de Villeneuve | Botched suicide, guillotined 18 June 1794\n |\n| ![](image) | 4 October 1792  – 18 October 1792 | Jean-François Delacroix | Guillotined with Georges Danton, 5 April 1794\n |\n| ![](image) | 18 October 1792  – 1 November 1792 | Marguerite-Élie Guadet | Guillotined 17 June 1794\n |\n| ![](image) | 1 November 1792  – 15 November 1792 | Marie-Jean Hérault de Séchelles | Guillotined with Georges Danton, 5 April 1794\n |\n| ![](image) | 15 November 1792  – 29 November 1792 | Henri Grégoire | Died 28 May 1831\n |\n| ![](image) | 29 November 1792 – 13 December 1792 | Bertrand Barère de Vieuzac | Died 13 January 1841\n |\n| ![portrait of Jacques defermon](image) | 13 December 1792  – 27 December 1792 | Jacques Defermon des Chapelieres | 20 June 1831\n |\n| ![](image) | 27 December 1792  – 10 January 1793 | Jean-Baptiste Treilhard | Died 1 December 1810\n |\n| ![](image) | 10 January 1793  – 24 January 1793 | Pierre Victurnien Vergniaud | 31 October 1793, guillotined.\n |\n| ![](image) | 24 January 1793  – 7 February 1793 | Jean-Paul Rabaut Saint-Étienne | 5 December 1793, guillotined\n |\n| ![](image) | 7 February 1793  – 21 February 1793 | Jean-Jacques Bréard, dit Bréard-Duplessis\n | 2 January 1840\n |\n| ![](image) | 21 February 1793  – 7 March 1793 | Edmond Louis Alexis Dubois-Crancé | 29 June 1814\n |\n| ![](image) | 7 March 1793  – 21 March 1793 | Armand Gensonné | 31 October 1793, guillotined\n |\n| ![](image) | 21 March 1793  – 4 April 1793 | Jean Antoine Joseph Debry | 6 January 1834, Paris\n |\n|  | 4 April 1793  – 18 April 1793 | Jean-François-Bertrand Delmas | Disappeared 19 August 1798[Notes 1] |\n|  | 18 April 1793  – 2 May 1793 | Marc David Alba Lasource | 31 October 1793, guillotined with the Girondists\n |\n| ![](image) | 2 May 1793  – 16 May 1793 | Jean-Baptiste Boyer-Fonfrède | 31 October 1793, guillotined\n |\n| ![](image) | 16 May 1793  – 30 May 1793 | Maximin Isnard | 12 March 1825\n |\n|  | 30 May 1793  – 13 June 1793 | François-René-Auguste Mallarmé | 25 July 1835\n |\n\n\nAt the end of May 1793, an uprising of the Parisian *sans culottes*, the day-laborers and working class, undermined much of the authority of the moderate Girondins.[19] At this point, although Danton and Hérault de Séchelles both served one more term each as Presidents of the Convention, the Girondins had lost control of the Convention: in June and July compromise after compromise changed the course of the revolution from a bourgeois event to a radical, working class event. Price controls were introduced and a minimum wage guaranteed to workers and soldiers. Over the course of the summer, the government became truly revolutionary.[20]\n\n\n\n### Radical phase: June 1793 – July 1794[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Insurrection of 31 May – 2 June 1793 and Reign of Terror\n\nAfter the insurrection, any attempted resistance to revolutionary ideals was crushed. The insurrection of 31 May – 2 June 1793 marked a significant milestone in the history of the French Revolution. The days of 31 May – 2 June (French: *journées*) resulted in the fall of the Girondin party under pressure of the Parisian *sans-culottes*, Jacobins of the clubs, and Montagnards in the National Convention. The following men were elected as presidents of the Convention during its transition from its moderate to radical phase.[11]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Portrait\n | Dates\n | Name\n | Death\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | 13 June 1793  – 27 June 1793 | Jean-Marie Collot d'Herbois | 8 June 1796, deported to French Guiana, died of yellow fever |\n|  | 27 June 1793  – 11 July 1793 | Jacques Alexis Thuriot de la Rosière | 20 June 1829, died in exile\n |\n| ![](image) | 11 July 1793  – 25 July 1793 | Andre Jeanbon Saint Andre | 10 December 1813\n |\n| ![](image) | 25 July 1793  – 8 August 1793 | Georges Jacques Danton | A moderate guillotined by the radicals, 5 April 1794\n |\n| ![](image) | 8 August 1793  – 22 August 1793 | Marie-Jean Hérault de Séchelles | Guillotined with Georges Danton, 5 April 1794\n |\n\n\n*After 1793, President of the National Convention became a puppet office under the Committee of Public Safety*\nThe following men were elected as presidents of the Convention during its radical phase.[11]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Portrait\n | Dates\n | Name\n | Death\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | 22 August 1793  – 5 September 1793 | Maximilien Robespierre | 28 July 1794, guillotined during the Reaction\n |\n| File:Jacques Nicolas Billaud-Varenne engraving.jpg | 5 September 1793  – 19 September 1793 | Jacques Nicolas Billaud-Varenne | 3 June 1819\n |\n| ![](image) | 19 September 1793  – 3 October 1793 | Pierre Joseph Cambon | 15 February 1820\n |\n|  | 3 October 1793  – 22 October 1793 | Louis-Joseph Charlier | 23 February 1797\n |\n|  | 22 October 1793  – 6 November 1793 | Moïse Antoine Pierre Jean Bayle | 1812 or 1815\n |\n|  | 6 November 1793  – 21 November 1793 | Pierre-Antoine Lalloy | 16 March 1846\n |\n| ![](image) | 21 November 1793  – 6 December 1793 | Charles-Gilbert Romme | 17 June 1795, suicide prior to guillotine\n |\n|  | 6 December 1793  – 21 December 1793 | Jean-Henri Voulland | 23 February 1801\n |\n| ![](image) | 21 December 1793 – 5 January 1794 | Georges Auguste Couthon | 28 July 1794, guillotined during the ReactionOne of the few members of *La Marais* to be elected President\n |\n| ![](image) | 5 January 1794  – 20 January 1794 | Jacques-Louis David | 29 December 1825\n |\n| ![](image) | 20 January 1794  – 4 February 1794 | Marc Guillaume Alexis Vadier | 14 December 1828\n |\n|  | 4 February 1794  – 19 February 1794 | Joseph-Nicolas Barbeau du Barran | 16 May 1816, exiled in Switzerland during Bourbon Restoration |\n| ![](image) | 19 February 1794  – 6 March 1794 | Louis Antoine de Saint-Just | 28 July 1794, guillotine during Reaction\n |\n|  | 7 March 1794  – 21 March 1794 | Philippe Rühl | 29/30 May 1795, suicide\n |\n| ![](image) | 21 March 1794  – 5 April 1794 | Jean-Lambert Tallien | 16 November 1820\n |\n|  | 5 April 1794  – 20 April 1794 | Jean-Baptiste-André Amar | 21 December 1816\n |\n| ![](image) | 20 April 1794  – 5 May 1794 | Robert Lindet | 17 February 1825\n |\n| ![](image) | 5 May 1794  – 20 May 1794 | Lazare Carnot | 2 August 1823\n |\n| ![](image) | 20 May 1794  – 4 June 1794 | Claude-Antoine Prieur-Duvernois | 11 August 1832\n |\n| ![](image) | 4 June 1794  – 19 June 1794 | Maximilien Robespierre | 28 July 1794, guillotined during the Reaction\n |\n|  | 19 June 1794  – 5 July 1794 | Élie Lacoste | 26 November 1806\n |\n|  | 5 July 1794  – 19 July 1794 | Jean-Antoine Louis, also called Louis du Bas-Rhin\n |  |\n\n\n### Reaction: July 1794–1795[edit]\n\n\nSee also: The Mountain and Thermidorian Reaction\n\nIn 1794, Maximilien Robespierre continued to consolidate his power over the Montagnards with the use of the Committee of Public Safety.[21] By late spring, the moderate members of the Convention had had enough. They began to conspire secretly against Robespierre and his allies. The Thermidorian Reaction was a revolt within the Convention against the leadership of the Jacobin Club over the Committee of Public Safety. The National Convention voted to remove Maximilien Robespierre, Louis Antoine de Saint-Just, and several other leading members of the revolutionary government, and they were executed the following day. This ended the most radical phase of the French Revolution.[22][Notes 2]\n\n\nThe following men were Presidents of the Convention until its end.[11]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Portrait\n | Dates\n | Name\n | Death\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | 19 July 1794  – 3 August 1794 | Jean-Marie Collot d'Herbois | 8 June 1796\n |\n| ![](image) | 3 August 1794  – 18 August 1794 | Philippe Antoine Merlin, dit Merlin de Douai\n | 26 December 1838\n |\n|  | 18 August 1794  – 2 September 1794 | Antoine Merlin de Thionville | 14 September 1833\n |\n| ![](image) | 2 September 1794  – 22 September 1794 | André Antoine Bernard, dit Bernard de Saintes\n | 19 October 1818\n |\n|  | 22 September 1794  – 7 October 1794 | André Dumont | 19 October 1838\n |\n| ![](image) | 7 October 1794  – 22 October 1794 | Jean-Jacques-Régis de Cambacérès | 8 March 1824One of the few members of *La Marais* to be elected President Authored Napoleon's Civil Code |\n| ![](image) | 22 October 1794  – 6 November 1794 | Pierre-Louis Prieur, dit Prieur de la Marne\n | 31 May 1827\n |\n| ![](image) | 6 November 1794  – 24 November 1794 | Louis Legendre | 13 December 1797, died of natural causes (dementia)\n |\n|  | 24 November 1794  – 6 December 1794 | Jean-Baptiste Clauzel | 2 July 1803\n |\n| ![](image) | 6 December 1794  – 21 December 1794 | Jean-François Reubell | 23 November 1807\n |\n|  | 21 December 1794  – 6 January 1795 | Pierre-Louis Bentabole | 1797\n |\n| ![](image) | 6 January 1795  – 20 January 1795 | Étienne-François Le Tourneur | 4 October 1817\n |\n| ![](image) | 20 January 1795  – 4 February 1795 | Stanislas Joseph François Xavier Rovère | died in 1798 in French Guiana\n |\n| ![](image) | 4 February 1795  – 19 February 1795 | Paul Barras | 29 January 1829\n |\n| ![](image) | 19 February 1795  – 6 March 1795 | François Louis Bourdon | 22 June 1798, after being deported to French Guiana\n |\n| ![](image) | 6 March 1795  – 24 March 1795 | Antoine Claire Thibaudeau | 8 March 1854\n |\n| ![](image) | 24 March 1795  – 5 April 1795 | Jean Pelet, also Pelet de la Lozère\n | 26 January 1842\n |\n| ![](image) | 5 April 1795  – 20 April 1795 | François-Antoine de Boissy d'Anglas | 1828One of the few members of *La Marais* to be elected President\n |\n| ![](image) | 20 April 1795  – 5 May 1795 | Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès | 20 June 1836One of the few members of *La Marais* to be elected President\n |\n| ![](image) | 5 May 1795  – 26 May 1795 | Théodore Vernier |  |\n|  | 26 May 1795  – 4 June 1795 | Jean-Baptiste Charles Matthieu |  |\n| ![](image) | 4 June 1795  – 19 June 1795 | Jean Denis, comte Lanjuinais | died in 1828 in Paris\n |\n| ![](image) | 19 June 1795  – 4 July 1795 | Jean-Baptiste Louvet de Couvray | 25 August 1797\n |\n| ![](image) | 4 July 1795  – 19 July 1795 | Louis-Gustave Doulcet de Pontécoulant | 17 November 1764 – 3 April 1853\n |\n| ![](image) | 19 July 1795  – 3 August 1795 | Louis-Marie de La Révellière-Lépeaux | 24 March 1824\n |\n| ![](image) | 3 August 1795  – 19 August 1795 | Pierre Claude François Daunou | 20 June 1840\n |\n| ![](image) | 19 August 1795  – 2 September 1795 | Marie-Joseph Chénier | 10 January 1811\n |\n|  | 2 September 1795  – 23 September 1795 | Théophile Berlier | 12 September 1844\n |\n|  | 23 September 1795  – 8 October 1795 | Pierre-Charles-Louis Baudin | 1799\n |\n|  | 8 October 1795  – 26 October 1795 | Jean Joseph Victor Génissieu | 27 October 1804\n |\n\n\n### Presidents of the Committee of Public Safety[edit]\n\n\nPolitical parties\n\n  Montagnard  \n\n  Thermidorian  \n\n  Marais\n\n\n\n\n\n| No.\n | Portrait\n | Name(birth and death) | Term of office\n | Political party\n | Ref.\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image) | **Georges Danton**(1759–1794) | 6 April 1793\n | 27 July 1793\n | Montagnard | [23] |\n|  When all executive power was conferred upon a Committee of Public Safety, Danton had been one of the nine original members of that body.

Administered by a collective leadership of five directors, it preceded the Consulate established in a coup d'etat by Napoleon. It lasted from 2 November 1795 until 10 November 1799, a period commonly known as the \"Directory era\". The directory operated with a bicameral structure. A Council of the Ancients, selected by lot, named the directors. For its own security, the Left (whose members dominated the Council) resolved that all five must be old members of the Convention and regicides who had voted to execute King Louis XVI. The Ancients chose Jean-François Rewbell; Paul François Jean Nicolas, vicomte de Barras; Louis Marie de La Révellière-Lépeaux; Lazare Nicolas Marguerite Carnot; and Étienne-François Le Tourneur.[11]\n\n\nThe Directory was officially led by a president, as stipulated by Article 141 of the Constitution of the Year III. An entirely ceremonial post, the first president was Rewbell who was chosen by lot on 2 November 1795. The directors conducted their elections privately, with the presidency rotating every three months.[26] The last president was Gohier.[27]\n\n\nThe key figure of the Directory was Paul Barras, the only Director to serve throughout the Directory.\n\n\n\n\n\n| **Directors of the Directory (1 November 1795 – 10 November 1799)** |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Paul Barras | ![](image)Louis-Marie de La Révellière-Lépeaux | ![](image)Jean-François Rewbell | ![](image)Lazare Carnot | ![](image)Étienne-François Letourneur |\n| Letourneur drawn by lot to be replaced1 Prairial year V (20 May 1797). |\n| ![](image)François Barthélemy |\n| Barthélemy & Carnot proscribed and replaced afterCoup of 18 Fructidor year V (4 Sept. 1797). |\n| ![](image)Philippe-Antoine Merlin de Douai | ![](image)François de Neufchâteau |\n| Neufchâteau drawn by lot to be replaced26 Floréal year VI (15 May 1798). |\n| ![](image)Jean-Baptiste Treilhard |\n| Rewbell drawn by lot to be replaced27 Floréal year VII (16 May 1799). |\n| ![](image)Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyès |\n| Compelled to resign,30 Prairial year VII (18 June 1799). | Compelled to resign,30 Prairial year VII (18 June 1799). | Treilhard's election annulled as irregular,29 Prairial year VII (17 June 1799). |\n| ![](image)Roger Ducos | Jean-François-Auguste Moulin | ![](image)Louis-Jérôme Gohier |\n| After the Coup of 18 Brumaire (9 November 1799), Barras, Ducos & Sieyès resigned.Moulin & Gohier, refusing to resign, were arrested by General Moreau. |\n\n\n#### The Consulate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: French Consulate\n\n\n\n| **The provisional Consuls (10 November – 12 December 1799)** |\n| --- |\n| With the Coup of 18 Brumaire in 1799, the Directory was abolished, and a provisional committee of three Consuls took power. |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Napoleon Bonaparte | Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès | Roger Ducos |\n| **The Consuls (12 December 1799 – 18 May 1804)** |\n| With the Constitution of the Year VIII (December 1799), Bonaparte became First Consul for ten years, with two consuls appointed by him who had consultative voices only.With the Constitution of the Year X (August 1802), Bonaparte became First Consul for life, establishing a *de facto* dictatorship. |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Napoleon BonaparteFirst Consul\n | J.J.R. de CambacérèsSecond Consul\n | Charles-François LebrunThird Consul\n |\n| Napoleon took the title Emperor of the French on 18 May 1804, ending the Consulate and establishing the First French Empire. |\n\n\n## House of Bonaparte, First Empire (1804–1814)[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: House of Bonaparte and First French Empire\n\n\n\n| Portrait\n | Coat of arms\n | Name\n | From\n | Until\n | Title\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Napoleon I, *the Great*(Napoléon Ier, le Grand) | 18 May 1804 | 11 April 1814[2] | Emperor of the French (Empereur des Français) |\n\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte became Emperor in 1804 following a referendum. He received the title Emperor of the French to differentiate himself from the previous monarchs. His rule saw the domination of France as it crushed the Prussians, Russians, Austrians and British alike. Napoleon's rule lasted from 1804 to 1814 when after many coalitions against him he was defeated by the combined might of the other powers of Europe. He would then be exiled to the Island of Elba off the coast of Italy. However he was given the island to run as the Emperor of Elba.\n\n\n\n## Capetian Dynasty (1814–1815)[edit]\n\n\n### House of Bourbon, Bourbon Restoration (1814–1815)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bourbon Restoration in France\n\n\n\n| Portrait\n | Coat of arms\n | Name\n | From\n | Until\n | Relationship with his predecessors\n | Title\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Louis XVIII | 11 April 1814 | 20 March 1815 |  • Grandson of Louis XV  • Younger brother of Louis XVI[2] | King of France and of Navarre (Roi de France et de Navarre) |\n\n\n## House of Bonaparte, First Empire (Hundred Days, 1815)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hundred Days\n\n\n\n| Portrait\n | Coat of arms\n | Name\n | From\n | Until\n | Relationship with his predecessor\n | Title\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Napoleon I (Napoléon Ier) | 20 March 1815 | 22 June 1815[2] | *None* | Emperor of the French (Empereur des Français) |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Napoleon II(Napoléon II) [n 1] | 22 June 1815 | 7 July 1815\n |  • Son of Napoleon I\n | Emperor of the French (Empereur des Français) |\n\n\n## Capetian Dynasty (1815–1848)[edit]\n\n\n### House of Bourbon (1815–1830)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Portrait\n | Coat of arms\n | Name\n | From\n | Until\n | Relationship with his predecessor\n | Title\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Louis XVIII | 7 July 1815 | 16 September 1824[2] |  • Grandson of Louis XV  • Younger brother of Louis XVI\n | King of France and of Navarre (Roi de France et de Navarre) |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | Charles X | 16 September 1824 | 2 August 1830 |  • Grandson of Louis XV  • Younger Brother of Louis XVI and Louis XVIII\n | King of France and of Navarre (Roi de France et de Navarre) |\n\n\n### Revolution of 1830[edit]\n\n\nFor a few days during the July Revolution, Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette held executive power and was offered the presidency of a Republic.

Due to his great age (upon entering office, he was just a few days short of his 81st birthday), Dupont de l'Eure effectively delegated part of his duties to Minister of Foreign Affairs Alphonse de Lamartine.

Narrowly elected in the 1974 election, he instigated numerous reforms, including the lowering of the age of civil majority from 21 to 18, and the legalisation of abortion. He soon faced a global economic crisis and rising unemployment. Although the polls initially gave him a lead, he was defeated in the 1981 election by François Mitterrand, partly due to the disunion within the right wing. |\n| 21\n | ![](image) | **François Mitterrand**(1916–1996) | 21 May 1981 | 17 May 1995\n | Socialist Party (PS)\n | [49] |\n| 1981, 1988 |\n| Candidate of a united left-wing ticket in the 1965 election, he founded the Socialist Party in 1971.

After the right-wing victory in the 1986 legislative elections, he named Jacques Chirac Prime Minister, thus beginning the first cohabitation. Re-elected in the 1988 election against Chirac, he was again forced to cohabit with Édouard Balladur following the 1993 legislative elections. He retired in 1995 after the conclusion of his second term.

He engaged in social reforms to counter \"social fracture\". In 1997, he dissolved the Assemblée nationale; a left-wing victory in the 1997 legislative elections, forced him to name Lionel Jospin Prime Minister for a five-year cohabitation. Presidential terms reduced from seven to five years. In 2002, he was re-elected against the leader of the extreme right-wing Jean-Marie Le Pen. Opposed the Iraq War.

Unionists recognized the Orléanist claimant after 1883.\n* Legitimist-Anjou claimants to the throne of France: descendants of Louis XIV, claiming precedence over the House of Orléans by virtue of primogeniture\n* Orléanist claimants to the throne of France: descendants of Louis-Phillippe, himself descended from a junior line of the Bourbon dynasty, rejecting all heads of state since 1848.\n* Bonapartist claimants to the throne of France: descendants of Napoleon I and his brothers, rejecting all heads of state 1815–48, and since 1870.\n* English claimants to the throne of France: Kings of England and later, of Great Britain (renounced by Hanoverian King George III upon union with Ireland)\n* Jacobite claimants to the throne of France: senior heirs-general of King Edward III of England and thus his claim to the French throne, also claiming England, Scotland, and Ireland.\n\n\n## Timeline[edit]\n\n\n### 509 - 1795[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\n### 1792 - *Present*[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of French monarchs\n* List of presidents of the National Convention\n* List of presidents of France\n* Ministers of the French National Convention\n* Representative on mission\n* Full list of members of the Convention per department: List of members of the National Convention by Department (French)\n* List of foreign ministers of France\n* List of prime ministers of France\n* President of France\n* British claims to the French throne\n* Kings of France family tree\n* Style of the French sovereign\n\n\n## Notes, citations and sources[edit]\n\n\n### Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** From 22 June to 7 July 1815, Bonapartists considered Napoleon II as the legitimate heir to the throne, his father having abdicated in his favor. However, throughout this period he resided in Austria, with his mother. Louis XVIII was reinstalled as king on 7 July\n1. **^** From 9 Apr 1793 to 18 Apr 1793 the functions of president were exercised by vice-president Jacques-Alexis Thuriot de la Rosière. He was elected president in his own right for the fortnight 27 June 1793  – 11 July 1793\n2. **^** The name *Thermidorian* refers to 9 Thermidor Year II (27 July 1794), the date according to the French Revolutionary Calendar when Robespierre and other radical revolutionaries came under concerted attack in the National Convention. *Thermidorian Reaction* also refers to the remaining period until the National Convention was superseded by the Directory; this is also sometimes called the era of the Thermidorian Convention. Prominent figures of Thermidor include Paul Barras, Jean-Lambert Tallien, and Joseph Fouché.

The Prussian-led North German Confederation (1866-1871) subsequently morphed into a modern nation state, the German Reich, which was ruled by emperors from 1871 to the collapse of all German monarchies in 1918.\n\n\nThe President of Germany replaced the monarch in 1919. Chancellor Adolf Hitler assumed the duties of head of state as *Führer and Chancellor* from 1934 until his suicide in April 1945. In 1949, Germany was divided into two states. The Federal President, head of state of West Germany, became head of state for all of Germany following German reunification in 1990.\n\n\n\n### East Frankish kingdom, 843–962[edit]\n\n\n#### Carolingians[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Seal/Portrait\n | Name\n | House\n | King\n | Emperor\n | Ended\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | Louis the GermanLudwig der Deutsche | Carolingian | 11 August 843\n | —\n | 23 August 876\n | Son of Emperor Louis the Pious and grandson of Charlemagne |\n| ![](image) | Carloman(Karlmann) | Carolingian | 28 August\n876\n | —\n | 22 March 880\n | Son of Louis the German; ruled in Bavaria; from 877, also King of Italy\n |\n| ![](image) | Louis the Younger(Ludwig III. der Jüngere) | Carolingian | 28 August 876\n | —\n | 20 January 882\n | Son of Louis the German; ruled in East Francia, Saxony; from 880, also Bavaria |\n| ![](image) | **Charles the Fat**(Karl III. der Dicke) | Carolingian | 28 August 876\n | 12 February 881\n | 11 November 887\n | Son of Louis the German; ruled in Alemannia, Raetia, from 882 in the entire Eastern Kingdom; from 879, also King of Italy\n |\n| ![](image) | **Arnulf of Carinthia**(Arnulf von Kärnten) | Carolingian | 30 November 887\n | 25 April 896\n | 8 December 899\n | Illegitimate son of Carloman\n |\n| ![](image) | Louis the Child(Ludwig IV. das Kind) | Carolingian | 21 January 900\n | —\n | 20/24 September 911\n | Son of Arnulf of Carinthia\n |\n\n\n#### Conradine dynasty[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Seal\n | Name\n | House\n | King\n | Emperor\n | Ended\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | Conrad I(Konrad I.) | Conradine (Franconian) | 10 November 911\n | —\n | 23 December 918\n | Elected by the nobility\n |\n\n\n#### Ottonian dynasty[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Seal\n | Name\n | House\n | King\n | Emperor\n | Ended\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | Henry I the Fowler(Heinrich I. der Vogler) | Liudolfing (Saxon) | 23 April 919\n | —\n | 2 July 936\n | Elected by the nobility\n |\n| ![](image) | *Arnulf the Bad*(Arnulf der Böse, Herzog von Bayern) | Luitpolding (Bavarian) | 919\n | —\n | 921\n | Rival king to Henry I\n |\n\n\n### Holy Roman Empire, 962–1806[edit]\n\n\nThe title \"King of the Romans\", used under the Holy Roman Empire, is (from this point onwards) considered equivalent to King of Germany.

The first to take the title was Odoacer, a barbarian military leader, in the late 5th century, followed by the Ostrogothic kings up to the mid-6th century. With the Frankish conquest of Italy in the 8th century, the Carolingians assumed the title, which was maintained by subsequent Holy Roman Emperors throughout the Middle Ages. The last Emperor to claim the title was Charles V in the 16th century. During this period, the holders of the title were crowned with the Iron Crown of Lombardy.\n\n\nFrom the unification of Italy in 1861 to 1946 the head of state was the King of Italy, who was the same person as the King of Sardinia according to the Constitution. Italy became a republic under the Constitution of 1948 and the monarch was replaced by a President.\n\n\n\n\n## Monarchs[edit]\n\n\n### As \"Rex Italiae\"[edit]\n\n\n* Odoacer (476–493)\n\n\nvassal of the Eastern Roman Empire.\n### Ostrogothic Kingdom (493 – 553)[edit]\n\n\n* Theoderic the Great (493 – 526)\n* Athalaric (526 – 534)\n* Theodahad (534 – 536)\n* Witiges (536 – 540)\n* Ildibad (540 – 541)\n* Eraric (541)\n* Totila (541 – 552)\n* Teia (552 – 553)\n\n\n### Kingdom of the Lombards (568 – 814)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of kings of the Lombards\n\n* Alboin (568 – 572)\n* Cleph (572 – 574)\n* *Rule of the dukes* (ten-year interregnum)\n* Authari (584 – 590)\n* Agilulf (591 – c. 616)\n* Adaloald (c. 616 – c. 626)\n* Arioald (c. 626 – 636)\n* Rothari (636 – 652)\n* Rodoald (652 – 653)\n* Aripert I (653 – 661)\n* Perctarit and Godepert (661 – 662)\n* Grimoald (662 – 671)\n* Perctarit (671 – 688), restored from exile\n* Alahis (688 – 689), rebel\n* Cunincpert (688 – 700)\n* Liutpert (700 – 701)\n* Raginpert (701)\n* Aripert II (701 – 712)\n* Ansprand (712)\n* Liutprand (712 – 744)\n* Hildeprand (744)\n* Ratchis (744 – 749)\n* Aistulf (749 – 756)\n* Desiderius (756 – 774)\n* Charlemagne (774 – 814)\n\n\n### Kingdom of Italy (781 – 962)[edit]\n\n\n#### Carolingian dynasty (781 – 888)[edit]\n\n\n* Pippin (781 – 810)\n* Bernard (810 – 818)\n* Louis I (818 – 822)\n* Lothair I (822 – 855)\n* Louis II (844 – 875)\n* Charles II the Bald (875 – 877)\n* Carloman (877 – 879)\n* Charles III the Fat (879 – 887)\n\n\n#### Instability (888 – 962)[edit]\n\n\nAfter 887, Italy fell into instability, with many rulers claiming the kingship simultaneously:\n\n\n\n* Berengar I (888 – 896)\n\n\nvassal of the German King Arnulf of Carinthia, reduced to Friuli 889-894, deposed by Arnulf in 896.\n* Guy of Spoleto (889 – 894)\n\n\nopponent of Berengar, ruled most of Italy but was deposed by Arnulf.\n* Lambert of Spoleto (891 – 896)\n\n\nsubking of his father Guy before 894, reduced to Spoleto 894–895.\n* Arnulf of Carinthia (894 – 899)[1]\n\t+ Ratold (sub-king 896)\n\n\nIn 896, Arnulf and Ratold lost control of Italy, which was divided between Berengar and Lambert:\n\n\n\n* Berengar I (896 – 924)\n\n\nseized Lambert's portion upon the latter's death in 898.\n* Lambert of Spoleto (896 – 898)\n* Louis III of Provence (900-905)\n\n\nopposed Berengar 900-902 and 905.\n* Rudolph II of Burgundy (922 – 933)\n\n\ndefeated Berengar but fled Italy in 926.\n* Hugh of Arles (926 – 947)\n\n\nelected by Berengar's partisans in 925, resigned to Provence after 945.\n* Lothair II of Arles (945 – 950)\n* Berengar II of Ivrea (950 – 961)\n\n\njointly with his son:\n* Adalbert of Ivrea (950 – 961)\n\n\nIn 951 Otto I of Germany invaded Italy and was crowned with the Iron Crown of Lombardy.

Macron is *ex officio* one of the two Co-Princes of Andorra. He previously served as Minister of Economics, Industry and Digital Affairs under President François Hollande from 2014 to 2016, and as Deputy Secretary-General to the President from 2012 to 2014. He is a founding member of Renaissance.\n\n\nBorn in Amiens, Macron studied philosophy at Paris Nanterre University, later completing a master's degree in public affairs at Sciences Po and graduating from the École nationale d'administration in 2004. He worked as a senior civil servant at the Inspectorate General of Finances and later became an investment banker at Rothschild & Co.\n\n\nAppointed Élysée deputy secretary-general by President François Hollande shortly after his election in May 2012, Macron was one of Hollande's senior advisers. Appointed Minister of Economics, Industry and Digital Affairs in August of 2014 in the second Valls government, he led a number of business-friendly reforms. He resigned in August 2016, in order to launch his 2017 presidential campaign. A member of the Socialist Party from 2006 to 2009, he ran in the election under the banner of En Marche, a centrist and pro-European political movement he founded in April 2016.\n\n\nPartly as a result of the Fillon affair which sank The Republicans nominee François Fillon's chances, Macron topped the ballot in the first round of voting, and was elected President of France on 7 May 2017 with 66.1% of the vote in the second round, defeating Marine Le Pen of the National Front. At the age of 39, he became the youngest president in French history. In the 2017 legislative election in June, his party, renamed La République En Marche! (LREM), secured a majority in the National Assembly. He appointed Édouard Philippe as prime minister. When Philippe resigned in 2020, Macron appointed Jean Castex to replace him. \n\n\nMacron was elected to a second term in the 2022 presidential election, again defeating Le Pen, thus becoming the first French presidential candidate to win reelection since Jacques Chirac defeated Jean-Marie Le Pen in 2002. However, in the 2022 legislative election, his centrist coalition lost its absolute majority, resulting in a hung parliament and the formation of France's first minority government since the fall of the Bérégovoy government in 1993. Macron's current prime minister is Élisabeth Borne, the second female head of government in French history, whom he appointed in May 2022 to replace Castex. He has reshuffled the current cabinet twice since its formation: first in July 2022, and then again in July 2023.\n\n\nDuring his presidency, Macron has overseen several reforms to labour laws, taxation, and pensions; and has pursued a renewable energy transition. Dubbed \"president of the rich\" by political opponents, increasing protests against his domestic reforms and demanding his resignation marked the first years of his presidency, culminating in 2018–2020 with the yellow vests protests and the pension reform strike. From 2020, he led France's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccination rollout. In 2023, the government of his prime minister, Élisabeth Borne, passed legislation raising the retirement age from 62 to 64; the pension reforms proved controversial and led to public sector strikes and violent protests. In foreign policy, he called for reforms to the European Union (EU) and signed bilateral treaties with Italy and Germany. Macron conducted €42 billion in trade and business agreements with China during the China–United States trade war and oversaw a dispute with Australia and the United States over the AUKUS security pact. He continued Opération Chammal in the war against the Islamic State and joined in the international condemnation of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nMacron was born on 21 December 1977 in Amiens. He is the son of Françoise Macron (née Noguès), a physician, and Jean-Michel Macron, professor of neurology at the University of Picardy.[1][2] The couple divorced in 2010. He has two siblings, Laurent, born in 1979, and Estelle, born in 1982. Françoise and Jean-Michel's first child was stillborn.[3]\n\n\nThe Macron family legacy is traced back to the village of Authie, Picardy.[4] One of his paternal great-grandfathers, George William Robertson, was English, and was born in Bristol, United Kingdom.[5][6] His maternal grandparents, Jean and Germaine Noguès (née Arribet), are from the Pyrenean town of Bagnères-de-Bigorre, Gascony.[7] He commonly visited Bagnères-de-Bigorre to visit his grandmother Germaine, whom he called \"Manette\".[8] Macron associates his enjoyment of reading[9] and his leftward political leanings to Germaine, who, after coming from a modest upbringing of a stationmaster father and a housekeeping mother, became a teacher then a principal, and died in 2013.[10]\n\n\nAlthough raised in a non-religious family, Macron was baptised a Catholic at his own request at age 12; he is agnostic today.[11]\n\n\nMacron was educated mainly at the Jesuit institute Lycée la Providence[12] in Amiens[13] before his parents sent him to finish his last year of school[14] at the elite Lycée Henri-IV in Paris, where he completed the high school curriculum and the undergraduate program with a \"Bac S, Mention Très bien\". At the same time, he was nominated for the \"Concours général\" (most selective national level high school competition) in French literature and received his diploma for his piano studies at Amiens Conservatory.[15] His parents sent him to Paris due to their alarm at the bond he had formed with Brigitte Auzière, a married teacher with three children at Jésuites de la Providence, who later became his wife.[16]\n\n\nIn Paris, Macron twice failed to gain entry to the École normale supérieure.[17][18][19] He instead studied philosophy at the University of Paris-Ouest Nanterre La Défense, obtaining a DEA degree (a master level degree), with a thesis on Machiavelli and Hegel.[12][20] Around 1999 Macron worked as an editorial assistant to Paul Ricoeur, the French Protestant philosopher who was then writing his last major work, *La Mémoire, l'Histoire, l'Oubli*. Macron worked mainly on the notes and bibliography.[21][22] Macron became a member of the editorial board of the literary magazine *Esprit*.[23]\n\n\nMacron did not perform national service because he was pursuing his graduate studies. Born in December 1977, he belonged to the last cohort for whom military service was mandatory.[24][25]\n\n\nMacron obtained a master's degree in public affairs at Sciences Po, majoring in \"Public Guidance and Economy\" before training for a senior civil service career at the selective École nationale d'administration (ENA), training at the French Embassy in Nigeria[26] and at the prefecture of Oise before graduating in 2004.[27]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Inspector of Finances[edit]\n\n\nAfter graduating from ENA in 2004, Macron became an Inspector in the *Inspection générale des finances* (IGF), a branch of the Finance Ministry.[21] Macron was mentored by Jean-Pierre Jouyet, the then-head of the IGF.[28] During his time as an Inspector of Finances, Macron gave lectures during the summer at the \"prep'ENA\" (a special cram school for the ENA entrance examination) at IPESUP, an elite private school specializing in preparation for the entrance examinations of the *Grandes écoles*, such as HEC or Sciences Po.[29][30][31]\n\n\nIn 2006, Laurence Parisot offered him the job of managing director for *Mouvement des Entreprises de France*, the largest employer federation in France, but he declined.[32]\n\n\nIn August 2007, Macron was appointed deputy rapporteur for Jacques Attali's \"Commission to Unleash French Growth\".[13] In 2008, Macron paid €50,000 to buy himself out of his government contract.[33] He then became an investment banker in a highly-paid position at Rothschild & Cie Banque.[34][35] In March 2010, he was appointed to the Attali Commission as a member.[36]\n\n\n\n### Investment banker[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2008, Macron left his job as an Inspector of Finances and took a position at Rothschild & Cie Banque.[37] Macron left the government when Nicolas Sarkozy became president. He was originally offered the job by François Henrot. His first responsibility at the bank was assisting with the acquisition of Cofidis by Crédit Mutuel Nord Europe.[38]\n\n\nMacron formed a relationship with Alain Minc, a businessman on the supervisory board of *Le Monde*.[39] In 2010, Macron was promoted to partner with the bank after working on the recapitalization of *Le Monde* and the acquisition by Atos of Siemens IT Solutions and Services.[40] In the same year, Macron was put in charge of Nestlé's acquisition of Pfizer's infant nutrition division for €9 billion, which made him a millionaire.[41][42]\n\n\nIn February 2012, he advised businessman Philippe Tillous-Borde, the CEO of the Avril Group.[43]\n\n\nMacron reported that he had earned €2 million between December 2010 and May 2012.[44] Official documents show that between 2009 and 2013, Macron had earned almost €3 million.[45] He left Rothschild & Cie in 2012.[46][47]\n\n\n\n## Political career[edit]\n\n\nIn his youth, Macron worked for the Citizen and Republican Movement for two years, but he never applied to be a member.[48][44] Macron was an assistant for Mayor Georges Sarre of the 11th arrondissement of Paris during his time at Sciences Po.[49] Macron had been a member of the Socialist Party since he was 24,[50] but last renewed his membership for the period 2006–2009.[51]\n\n\nMacron met François Hollande through Jean-Pierre Jouyet in 2006 and joined his staff in 2010.[50] In 2007, Macron attempted to run for a seat in the National Assembly in Picardy under the Socialist Party label in the 2007 legislative elections, however, his application was declined.[52] Macron was offered the chance to be the deputy chief of staff to Prime Minister François Fillon in 2010, though he declined.[53]\n\n\n\n### Deputy Secretary-General of the Élysée[edit]\n\n\nOn 15 May 2012, Macron became the deputy secretary-general of the Élysée, a senior role in President François Hollande's staff.[54][27] Macron served with Nicolas Revel. He served under the secretary-general, Pierre-René Lemas.\n\n\nDuring the summer of 2012, Macron put forward a proposal that would increase the 35-hour work week to 37 hours until 2014. He also tried to hold back the large tax increases on the highest earners that were planned by the government. Hollande refused Macron's proposals.[55] In 2013, his was one of the deciding votes against regulating the salaries of CEOs.[56] Nicolas Revel, the other deputy secretary-general of the Élysée opposed Macron on a proposed budget responsibility pact favoured by the Medef.[57]\n\n\nOn 10 June 2014, it was announced that Macron had resigned from his role and was replaced by Laurence Boone.[58] Reasons given for his departure included his disappointment at not being included in the first Government of Manuel Valls and his frustration with his lack of influence on the reforms proposed by the government.[57] This was following the appointment of Jean-Pierre Jouyet as chief of staff.[59]\n\n\nJouyet said that Macron left to \"continue personal aspirations\"[60] and create his own financial consultancy firm.[61] It was later reported that he was planning to create an investment firm that would attempt to fund educational projects.[48] Shortly afterwards he was hired as a research fellow at the University of Berlin with the help of businessman Alain Minc. He had also sought a position at Harvard University.[62]\n\n\nOffered a chance to be a candidate in the municipal elections in 2014 in his hometown of Amiens, Macron declined,[63] leading François Hollande to reject Manuel Valls idea of appointing him Budget Minister, as he had never been elected to public office.[59]\n\n\n\n### Minister of Economics and Industry[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Uber Files\n\n![](image)Macron as the French Minister of Economics and IndustryHe was appointed as the Minister of Economics and Industry in the second Valls Cabinet on 26 August 2014, replacing Arnaud Montebourg.[64] He was the youngest Minister of Economics since Valéry Giscard d'Estaing in 1962.[65] Macron was branded by the media as the \"Anti-Montebourg\" due to being pro-EU and much more moderate, while Montebourg was eurosceptic and left-wing.[66] As Minister of Economics, Macron was at the forefront of pushing through business-friendly reforms. On 17 February 2015, prime minister Manuel Valls pushed Macron's signature law package through a reluctant parliament using the special 49.3 procedure.[67]\n\n\nMacron increased the French share in the company Renault from 15% to 20% and then enforced the *Florange law* which grants double voting rights on shares registered for more than two years unless two-thirds of shareholders vote to overturn it.[68] This gave the French state a minority share in the company though Macron later stated that the government would limit its powers within Renault.[69]\n\n\nMacron was widely criticized for being unable to prevent the closing down of an Ecopla factory in Isère.[70]\n\n\nIn August 2015, Macron said that he was no longer a member of the Socialist Party and was an independent.[51]\n\n\n\n#### Macron Law[edit]\n\n\nA law which had originally been sponsored by Arnaud Montebourg before he left the government, and which had focused on \"purchasing power\", grew into the Macron law [fr], a grab bag of measures liberalizing laws prohibiting work on Sunday and at night; restrictions on coaches for public transportation; regulations for debt collectors, barristers and auctioneers; and rules governing the rental of equipment by the military from private companies. The law also sought to simplify many government procedures, such as that for obtaining a driving licence.[71][72] Manuel Valls, fearing that it would not pass in the National Assembly, decided to push the law through with the 49.3 procedure[73][67] and so it was adopted on 10 April 2015.[74]\n\n\nEstimates of the increase in GDP the law might generate ranged from 0.3% to 0.5%.[75][76]\n\n\n\n### 2017 presidential campaign[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2017 French presidential election\n\n#### Formation of En Marche and resignation from government[edit]\n\n\nMacron first became known to the French public after his appearance on the French TV programme *Des Paroles Et Des Actes* in March 2015.[77] Before forming his political party En Marche!, he gave a number of speeches, his first one in March 2015 in Val-de-Marne.[78] He threatened to leave Manuel Valls' second government over the proposed removal of dual-nationality from terrorists.[79][80] He also took various foreign trips, including one to Israel where he spoke on the advancement of digital technology.[81]\n\n\nTensions around the question of Macron's loyalty to the Valls government and Hollande increased when they turned down a bill he put forward dubbed \"Macron 2\", which had a larger scope than his original law.[82][83] Macron was given the chance to help draft into the El Khomri law and put specific parts of \"Macron 2\" into the law though El Khomri was able to overturn these with the help of other ministers.[*citation needed*][*clarification needed*]\n\n\nAmid tensions and deterioration of relations with the current government, Macron founded an independent political party, En Marche, in Amiens on 6 April 2016.[84] A liberal,[85] progressive[86][87] political movement that gathered huge media coverage when it was first established,[88] the party and Macron were both reprimanded by President Hollande and the question of Macron's loyalty to the government was raised.[89][90] Several MEPs spoke out in support for the movement[91] though the majority of the Socialist Party spoke against En Marche including Manuel Valls,[92] Michel Sapin,[93] Axelle Lemaire and Christian Eckert.[94]\n\n\nIn June 2016, support for Macron and his movement, En Marche, began to grow in the media with *Libération* reporting that *L'Express*, *Les Échos*, Le 1 [fr], and *L'Opinion* had begun to support him.[95] Following several controversies surrounding trade unionists and their protests, Acrimed [fr] reported that major newspapers began to run front-page stories about Macron and En Marche.[96] Criticized by both the far-left and the far-right, these pro-Macron influencers in the press were dubbed \"Macronites\".[97][98]\n\n\nIn May 2016, Orleans mayor Olivier Carré invited Macron to the festival commemorating the 587th anniversary of Joan of Arc's efforts during the Siege of Orléans.[99][100] LCI reported that Macron was trying to take back the symbol of Joan of Arc from the far-right. [101] Macron later went to Puy du Fou and declared he was \"not a socialist\" in a speech amid rumours he was going to leave the current government.[102]\nOn 30 August 2016, Macron resigned from the government ahead of the 2017 presidential election,[103][104] to devote himself to his En Marche movement.[105][106] There had been rising tensions and several reports that he had wanted to leave the Valls government since early 2015.[107] He initially planned to leave after the cancellation[*clarification needed*] of his \"Macron 2\" law[83] but decided to stay on temporarily after a meeting with President François Hollande.[108] Michel Sapin was announced as Macron's replacement,[109] while Hollande said he felt Macron had \"methodically betrayed\" him.[110] An IFOP poll showed that 84% of those surveyed agreed with his decision to resign.[111]\n\n\n\n#### First round of the presidential election[edit]\n\n\nMacron first showed his intention to run by forming En Marche, but following his resignation from the government, he was able to dedicate more time to his movement. He first announced that he was considering running for president in April 2016,[112] and after his resignation from the position of economy minister, media sources began to identify patterns in his fundraising indicating he would run.[113] In October 2016, Macron criticized Hollande's goal of being a \"normal\" president, saying that France needed a more \"Jupiterian presidency\".[114]\n\n\nOn 16 November 2016, Macron formally declared his candidacy for the French presidency after months of speculation. In his announcement speech, he called for a \"democratic revolution\" and promised to \"unblock France\".[115] He had expressed hope that Hollande would run several months earlier, saying that—as the sitting president—he was the legitimate Socialist party candidate.[116][117] Macron's book *Révolution* was published on 24 November 2016 and reached fifth position on the French best-seller list in December 2016.[118]\n\n\nShortly after announcing his run, Jean-Christophe Cambadélis and Manuel Valls both asked Macron to run in the Socialist Party presidential primary, which he ultimately refused to do.[119][120] Jean-Christophe Cambadélis began to threaten to exclude members who associated or supported Macron following Lyon mayor Gérard Collomb throwing his support behind him.[121]\n\n\nMacron's campaign, headed by French economist Sophie Ferracci,[122] announced in December 2016 that it had raised 3.7 million euros in donations,[123] three times the budget of then-front runner Alain Juppé.[124] Macron came under criticism from several individuals, including Benoît Hamon−who requested he reveal a list of his donors and accused him of conflicts of interest due to the time he spent at Rothschilds,[125] which Macron dismissed as \"demagogy\".[126] Journalists Marion L'Hour and Frédéric Says later reported that he had spent €120,000 on setting up dinners and meetings with various personalities within the media and in French popular culture while at Bercy.[127] Christian Jacob and Philippe Vigier accused him of using this money to campaign without campaigning.[128] His successor, Michel Sapin, saw nothing illegal about his actions, saying that he had the right to spend the funds.[129] Macron called the allegations \"defamatory\" and said that none of the ministerial budget had been spent on his party.[127]\n\n\nMacron's campaign enjoyed considerable coverage from the media.[130] Mediapart reported that over fifty magazine covers were dedicated purely to him.[131] Friends with the owners of Le Monde[132] and Claude Perdiel, the former owner of Nouvel Observateur,[133] he was labelled the \"media candidate\" by the far-left and far-right and was viewed as such in opinion polls.[134][135][136] Many observers compared his campaign to a product being sold[137] due to Maurice Lévy, a former Publicis CEO, using marketing tactics to try to advance his presidential ambitions.[138][139] The magazine *Marianne* reported that BFM TV, owned by Patrick Drahi, broadcast more coverage of Macron than of all the other main candidates combined.[140] *Marianne* speculated that this might be due to the campaigns links with Drahi through Bernard Mourad.[141][142]\n\n\nFrançois Bayrou, with whom Macron had been compared, announced he was not going to stand in the presidential election and instead formed an electoral alliance with Macron,[143][144] whose poll ratings began to rise. After several legal issues surrounding François Fillon were publicized, Macron overtook him in the polls to become the front-runner.[145][146]\n\n\nMacron attracted criticism for the time taken to spell out a formal program during his campaign; despite declaring in November that he had still not released a complete set of proposals by February, attracting both attacks from critics and concern among allies and supporters.[147] He eventually laid out his 150-page formal program on 2 March, publishing it online and discussing it at a marathon press conference that day.[148]\n\n\n\n![](image)Macron's supporters celebrating his victory at the Louvre on 7 May 2017\nMacron accumulated a wide array of supporters, securing endorsements from François Bayrou of the Democratic Movement (MoDem), MEP Daniel Cohn-Bendit, the ecologist candidate François de Rugy of the primary of the left, and Socialist MP Richard Ferrand, secretary-general of En Marche, as well as numerous others – many of them from the Socialist Party, but also a significant number of centrist and centre-right politicians.[149] The Grand Mosque of Paris urged French Muslims to vote en masse for Macron.[150]\n\n\nOn 23 April 2017, Macron received the most votes in the first round of the presidential election, with more than 8 million votes (24%) and faced Marine Le Pen in the second round, with the support of former candidates François Fillon and Benoît Hamon[151] and the sitting president François Hollande.[152]\n\n\n\n#### Second round of the presidential election[edit]\n\n\nMany foreign politicians supported Macron in his bid against right-wing populist candidate Marine Le Pen, including European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, German Chancellor Angela Merkel,[153] and former US President Barack Obama.[154]\n\n\nA debate was arranged between Macron and Le Pen on 3 May 2017. The debate lasted for two hours and opinion polls showed that he was perceived to have won.[155]\n\n\nIn March 2017, Macron's digital campaign manager, Mounir Mahjoubi, told Britain's Sky News that Russia is behind \"high level attacks\" on Macron, and said that its state media are \"the first source of false information\". He said: \"We are accusing RT (formerly known as Russia Today) and Sputnik News (of being) the first source of false information shared about our candidate ...\".[156]\n\n\nTwo days before the French presidential election on 7 May, it was reported that nine gigabytes of Macron's campaign emails had been anonymously posted to Pastebin, a document-sharing site. These documents were then spread onto the imageboard 4chan, which led to the hashtag \"#macronleaks\" trending on Twitter.[157][158] In a statement the same evening, Macron's political movement, En Marche, said: \"The En Marche movement has been the victim of a massive and coordinated hack this evening which has given rise to the diffusion on social media of various internal information\".[159] Macron's campaign had previously been presented a report in March 2017 by the Japanese cyber security firm Trend Micro detailing how En Marche had been the target of phishing attacks.[160] Trend Micro said that the group conducting these attacks was the Russian hacking group Fancy Bear, also accused of hacking the Democratic National Committee on 22 July 2016.[160] 21,075 verified emails and another 50,773 emails it could not verify were released in July 2017 by WikiLeaks.[161] This followed Le Pen accusing Macron of tax avoidance.[162]\n\n\nOn 7 May 2017, Macron was elected President of France with 66.1% of the vote to Marine Le Pen's 33.9%. The election had record abstention at 25.4%, and 8% of ballots were blank or spoiled.[163] Macron resigned from his role as president of En Marche[164] and Catherine Barbaroux became interim leader.[165]\n\n\n\n## President of France[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Presidency of Emmanuel Macron\n\n### First term[edit]\n\n\nMacron qualified for the runoff after the first round of the election on 23 April 2017. He won the second round of the presidential election on 7 May 2017 by a landslide according to preliminary results,[166] making the candidate of the National Front, Marine Le Pen, concede.[167] At 39, he became the youngest president in French history and the youngest French head of state since Napoleon.[168][169] He is also the first president of France born after the establishment of the Fifth Republic in 1958.\n\n\nMacron formally became president on 14 May.[170] He appointed Patrick Strzoda as his chief of staff[171] and Ismaël Emelien as his special advisor for strategy, communication and speeches.[172] On 15 May, he appointed Édouard Philippe of the Republicans as Prime Minister.[173][174] On the same day, he made his first official foreign visit, meeting in Berlin with Angela Merkel, the Chancellor of Germany. The two leaders emphasised the importance of France–Germany relations to the European Union.[175] They agreed to draw up a \"common road map\" for Europe, insisting that neither was against changes to the Treaties of the European Union.[176]\n\n\nIn the 2017 legislative election, Macron's party La République En Marche and its Democratic Movement allies secured a comfortable majority, winning 350 seats out of 577.[177] After The Republicans emerged as the winners of the Senate elections, government spokesman Christophe Castaner stated the elections were a \"failure\" for his party.[178]\n\n\nOn 3 July 2020, Macron appointed the centre-right Jean Castex as the Prime Minister of France. Castex, described as a social conservative, was a member of The Republicans.[179] The appointment was described as \"doubling down on a course that is widely seen as centre-right in economic terms\".[180]\n\n\n\n### Domestic policy[edit]\n\n\nIn his first few months as president, Macron pressed for the enactment of a package of reforms on public ethics, labour laws, taxes, and law enforcement agency powers.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n#### Anti-corruption[edit]\n\n\nIn response to Penelopegate, the National Assembly passed a part of Macron's proposed law to stop mass corruption in French politics by July 2017, banning elected representatives from hiring family members.[181] Meanwhile, the second part of the law scrapping a constituency fund was scheduled for voting after Senate objections.[182]\n\n\nMacron's plan to give his wife an official role within government came under fire with criticisms ranging from its being undemocratic to what critics perceive as a contradiction to his fight against nepotism.[183] Following an online petition of nearly 290,000 signatures on change.org Macron abandoned the plan.[184] On 9 August, the National Assembly adopted the bill on public ethics, a key theme of Macron's campaign, after debates on the scrapping the constituency funds.[185]\n\n\n\n#### Labour policy and unions[edit]\n\n\nMacron aims to shift union-management relations away from the adversarial lines of the current French system and toward a more flexible, consensus-driven system modelled after Germany and Scandinavia.[186][187] He has also pledged to act against companies employing cheaper labour from eastern Europe and in return affecting jobs of French workers, what he has termed as \"social dumping\". Under the Posted Workers Directive 1996, eastern European workers can be employed for a limited time at the salary level in eastern European countries, which has led to dispute between the EU states.[188]\n\n\nThe French government announced the proposed changes to France's labour rules (\"Code du Travail\"), being among the first steps taken by Macron and his government to galvanize the French economy.[189] Macron's reform efforts have encountered resistance from some French trade unions.[190] The largest trade union, the CFDT, has taken a conciliatory approach to Macron's push and has engaged in negotiations with the president, while the more militant CGT is more hostile to reforms.[186][187] Macron's labour minister, Muriel Pénicaud, is overseeing the effort.[191]\n\n\nThe National Assembly including the Senate approved the proposal, allowing the government to loosen the labour laws after negotiations with unions and employers' groups.[192] The reforms, which were discussed with unions, limit payouts for dismissals deemed unfair and give companies greater freedom to hire and fire employees as well as to define acceptable working conditions. The president signed five decrees reforming the labour rules on 22 September.[193] Government figures released in October 2017 revealed that during the legislative push to reform the labour code, the unemployment rate had dropped 1.8%, the biggest since 2001.[194]\n\n\n\n#### Migrant crisis[edit]\n\n\nSpeaking on refugees and, specifically, the Calais Jungle, Macron said on 16 January 2018 that he would not allow another refugee camp to form in Paris before outlining the government policy towards immigration and asylum.[195] He has also announced plans to speed up asylum applications and deportations but give refugees better housing.[196]\n\n\nOn 23 June 2018, President Macron said: \"The reality is that Europe is not experiencing a migration crisis of the same magnitude as the one it experienced in 2015\", \"a country like Italy has not at all the same migratory pressure as last year. The crisis we are experiencing today in Europe is a political crisis\".[197] In November 2019, Macron introduced new immigration rules to restrict the number of refugees reaching France, while stating to \"take back control\" of the immigration policy.[198]\n\n\n\n#### Economic policy[edit]\n\n\nPierre de Villiers, then-Chief of the General Staff of the Armies, stepped down on 19 July 2017 following a confrontation with Macron.[199] De Villiers cited the military budget cut of €850 million as the main reason he was stepping down. *Le Monde* later reported that De Villiers told a parliamentary group, \"I will not let myself be fucked like this.\"[200] Macron named François Lecointre as De Villiers' replacement.[201]\n\n\nMacron's government presented its first budget on 27 September, the terms of which reduced taxes as well as spending to bring the public deficit in line with the EU's fiscal rules.[202] The budget replaced the wealth tax with one targeting real estate, fulfilling Macron's campaign pledge to scrap the wealth tax.[203] Before it was replaced, the tax collected up to 1.5% of the wealth of French residents whose global worth exceeded €1.3m.[204]\n\n\nIn February 2018, Macron announced a plan to offer voluntary redundancy in an attempt to further cut jobs from the French civil service.[205]\n\n\nIn December 2019, Macron announced that he would scrap the 20th-century pension system and introduce a single national pension system managed by the state.[206] In January 2020, after weeks of public transport shutdown and vandalism across Paris against the new pension plan, Macron compromised on the plan by revising the retirement age.[207] In February, the pension overhaul was adopted by decree using Article 49 of the French constitution.[208] However, on 16 March 2020, Macron announced that the draft legislation would be pulled as France went into lockdown to slow the spread of COVID-19.[209]\n\n\n\n#### Terrorism[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2017, the Senate approved its first reading of a controversial bill with stricter anti-terror laws, a campaign pledge of Macron. The National Assembly voted on 3 October to pass t\nbill 415–127, with 19 abstentions. Interior Minister Gérard Collomb described France as being \"still in a state of war\" ahead of the vote, with the 1 October Marseille stabbing having taken place two days prior. The Senate then passed the bill on its second reading by a 244–22 margin on 18 October. Later that day Macron stated that 13 terror plots had been foiled since early 2017. The law replaced the state of emergency in France and made some of its provisions permanent.[210]\n\n\nThe bill was criticized by human rights advocates. A public poll by *Le Figaro* showed 57% of the respondents approved of it even though 62% thought it would encroach on personal freedoms.[211]\n\n\nThe law gives authorities expanded power to search homes, restrict movement, close places of worship,[212] and search areas around train stations and international ports and airports. It was passed after modifications to address concerns about civil liberties. The most punitive measures will be reviewed annually and were scheduled to lapse by the end of 2020.[213] The bill was signed into law by Macron on 30 October 2017. He announced that starting 1 November, it would bring an end to the state of emergency.[214]\n\n\n\n#### Civil rights[edit]\n\n\nVisiting Corsica in February 2018, Macron sparked controversy when he rejected Corsican nationalist wishes for Corsican as an official language[215] but offered to recognize Corsica in the French constitution.[216]\n\n\nMacron also proposed a plan to \"reorganise\" the Islamic religion in France saying: \"We are working on the structuring of Islam in France and also on how to explain it, which is extremely important – my goal is to rediscover what lies at the heart of *laïcité*, the possibility of being able to believe as not to believe, in order to preserve national cohesion and the possibility of having free consciousness.\" He declined to reveal further information about the plan.[217]\n\n\n\n#### Foreign policy and national defence[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Macron at the 2018 G7 summit in Charlevoix, Quebec\n![](image)Macron shakes hands with US President Donald Trump in September 2018\n![](image)Macron with US President Joe Biden at the G20 summit in October 2021\n![](image)Macron and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi in 2021, following the signing of the Quirinal Treaty\n![](image)Macron, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Kyiv in 2022\nMacron attended the 2017 Brussels summit on 25 May 2017, his first NATO summit as president of France. At the summit, he met US President Donald Trump for the first time. The meeting was widely publicized due to a handshake between the two of them, characterized as a \"power-struggle\".[218][219]\n\n\nOn 29 May 2017, Macron met with Vladimir Putin at the Palace of Versailles. The meeting sparked controversy when Macron denounced Russia Today and Sputnik, accusing the news agencies of being \"organs of influence and propaganda, of lying propaganda\".[220][221] Macron also urged cooperation in the conflict against ISIS and warned that France would respond with force in Syria if chemical weapons were used.[222] In response to the chemical attack in Douma, Syria in 2018, Macron directed French participation in airstrikes against Syrian government sites, coordinated with the United States and the United Kingdom.[223][224]\n\n\nIn his first major foreign policy speech on 29 August, President Macron stated that fighting Islamist terrorism at home and abroad was France's top priority. Macron urged a tough international stance to pressure North Korea into negotiations, on the same day it fired a missile over Japan. He also affirmed his support for the Iranian nuclear deal and criticized Venezuela's government as a \"dictatorship\". He added that he would announce his new initiatives on the future of the European Union after the German elections in September.[225] At the 56th Munich Security Conference in February, Macron presented his 10-year vision policy to strengthen the European Union. Macron remarked that larger budget, integrated capital markets, effective defence policy and quick decision-making held the key for Europe. He added that reliance on NATO and especially the US and the UK was not good for Europe, and a dialogue must be established with Russia.[226]\n\n\nPrior to the 45th G7 summit in Biarritz, France, Macron hosted Vladimir Putin at the Fort de Brégançon, stating that \"Russia fully belongs within a Europe of values.\"[227] At the summit itself, Macron was invited to attend on the margins by Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif.[*clarification needed*] Macron, who \"attempted a high-risk diplomatic gambit\", thought that the Foreign Minister of Iran might be able to defuse the tense situation over the Iranian nuclear programme in spite of the recent uptick in tensions between the Islamic Republic and the United States and Britain.[228]\n\n\nIn March 2019, at a time when China–U.S. economic relations were troubled with a trade war underway, Macron and Chinese leader Xi Jinping signed a series of 15 large-scale trade and business agreements totaling 40 billion euros ($45 billion USD) which covered many sectors over a period of years.[229] This included a €30 billion purchase of airplanes from Airbus. Going beyond aviation, the new trade agreement covered French exports of chicken, a French-built offshore wind farm in China, a Franco-Chinese cooperation fund, as well as billions of Euros of co-financing between BNP Paribas and the Bank of China. Other plans included billions of euros to be spent on modernizing Chinese factories, as well as new ship building.[230]\n\n\nIn July 2020, Macron called for sanctions against Turkey for violating Greece's and Cyprus' sovereignty, saying it is \"not acceptable that the maritime space of (EU) member states be violated and threatened.\"[231] He also criticized Turkish military intervention in Libya.[232][233] Macron said that \"We have the right to expect more from Turkey than from Russia, given that it is a member of NATO.\"[234]\n\n\nIn 2021, Macron was reported as saying Northern Ireland was not truly part of the United Kingdom following disputes with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson over implementations of the Northern Ireland protocol.[235] He later denied this, saying he was referring to the fact that Great Britain is separated from Northern Ireland by sea in reference to the Irish Sea border.[236][237]\n\n\nFrench-U.S. relations became tense in September 2021 due to fallout from the AUKUS security pact between the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. The security pact is directed at countering Chinese power in the Indo-Pacific region. As part of the agreement, the U.S. agreed to provide nuclear-powered submarines to Australia. After entering into AUKUS, the Australian government canceled an agreement that it had made with France for the provision of French conventionally powered submarines, angering the French government.[238] On 17 September, France recalled its ambassadors from Australia and the US for consultations.[239] Despite tension in the past, France had never before withdrawn its ambassador to the United States.[240] After a call between Macron and U.S. President Joe Biden on request from the latter, the two leaders agreed to reduce bilateral tensions, and the White House acknowledged the crisis could have been averted if there had been open consultations between allies.[241][242][*unreliable source?*]\n\n\nOn 26 November 2021, Macron and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi signed the Quirinal Treaty at the Quirinal Palace in Rome.[243] The treaty aimed to promote the convergence and coordination of French and Italian positions in matters of European and foreign policies, security and defence, migration policy, economy, education, research, culture and cross-border cooperation.[244]\n\n\nDuring the prelude to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Macron spoke face-to-face and on the phone to Russian President Vladimir Putin.[245] During Macron's campaign for the re-election, nearly two months after the Russian invasion began, Macron called on European leaders to maintain dialogue with Putin.[246]\n\n\n\n#### Approval ratings[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Opinion polling on the Emmanuel Macron presidency\n\nSee also: Protests against Emmanuel Macron\n\n![](image)Approval and disapproval ratings of Macron\nAccording to an IFOP poll for *Le Journal du Dimanche*, Macron started his five-year term with a 62% approval rating,[247][248] which rose to 64% by 24 June.[249] One month later, Macron suffered a 10% point drop in popularity, the largest at the beginning of a term for any president since Jacques Chirac in 1995, and by August, his popularity had fallen off 24 percentage points since June.[250] This was attributed to his recent confrontations with former Chief of Defence Staff Pierre de Villiers,[251] the nationalization of the Chantiers de l'Atlantique shipyard owned by the bankrupt STX Offshore & Shipbuilding,[252] and a reduction in housing benefits.[253]\n\n\nBy the end of September 2017, seven out of ten respondents said that they believed Emmanuel Macron was respecting his campaign promises,[254][255] though a majority felt that the policies the government was putting forward were \"unfair\".[256] Macron's popularity fell sharply again in 2018, reaching about 25% by the end of November during the yellow vests movement.[257][*unreliable source?*] During the COVID-19 pandemic in France, his popularity increased, reaching 50% at its highest in July 2020.[258][259]\n\n\n\n#### Benalla affair[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Benalla affair\n\nOn 18 July 2018, *Le Monde* revealed in an article that a member of Macron's staff Alexandre Benalla posed as a police officer and beat a protester during May Day demonstrations in Paris earlier in the year and was suspended for a period of 15 days before only being internally demoted. The Élysée failed to refer the case to the public prosecutor and a preliminary investigation into the case was not opened until the day after the publication of the article, and the lenient penalty served by Benalla raised questions within the opposition about whether the executive deliberately chose not to inform the public prosecutor as required under the code of criminal procedure.[260]\n\n\n\n### 2022 presidential campaign[edit]\n\n\nIn the 2022 election, Macron was the first incumbent to be re-elected since Jacques Chirac defeated Jean-Marie Le Pen in the 2002 election.[261] Macron again defeated Marine Le Pen in the runoff, this time by a closer margin, with 58.55% of the votes to Le Pen's 41.45%.[262] Due to near-record abstentions, this represented 38.52% of registered voters, the lowest figure since Georges Pompidou's 37.5% in 1969.[263] The French far-right received their highest vote total since the start of the French Republic, with nationalist candidates (Le Pen, Zemmour and Dupont-Aignan) winning 32.3% of the votes in the first round and Le Pen achieving a record 41.5% of the votes in the second round.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Second term[edit]\n\n\nThough Macron's second inauguration took place on 7 May 2022, his second presidential term officially began on 14 May 2022. \n\n\n\n#### New government[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Borne government\n\nOn 16 May 2022, Prime Minister Jean Castex resigned after 22 months as head of government. The same day, President Macron appointed Élisabeth Borne at the Hôtel Matignon, thus making her the second female PM in French history after Édith Cresson between 1991 and 1992. She then formed a new government on 20 May 2022.\n\n\n\n### June 2022 legislative election[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2022 French legislative elections and July 2022 French government reshuffle\n\nIn June 2022, one month into his second term, less than two weeks before the end of the French presidency of the Council of the EU and days after he called for voters to hand him a \"solid majority\" in a controversial 'tarmac speech',[264] Macron lost his parliamentary majority and was returned a hung parliament in the second round of the 2022 legislative election:[265] Macron's presidential coalition, which had a 115-seat majority going into the election, failed to reach the threshold of 289 seats needed to command an overall majority in the National Assembly, retaining only 251 out of the 346 it had held in the previous Assembly, and falling 38 short of an absolute majority.[266] Crucially, three close political allies to President Macron were defeated in the elections: incumbent President of the National Assembly Richard Ferrand, Macron's own LREM parliamentary party leader Christophe Castaner and MoDem parliamentary group leader Patrick Mignola, thus effectively \"decapitating\" Macron's parliamentary bloc leadership and further weakening the President's political position in hung parliament territory.[267]\n\n\n\n![](image)16th National Assembly of France, elected in 2022, is France's current legislature.\nThree government ministers resigned after losing their seats: Justine Bénin (junior minister for the Sea), Brigitte Bourguignon (Minister for Health and Prevention) and Amélie de Montchalin (Minister for Ecological Transition).[268]\n\n\nMacron's government, still led by Prime Minister Élisabeth Borne, was reshuffled in early July 2022 and continued as a minority administration, after talks with opposition leaders to form a stable majority government failed.[269]\n\n\n\n### Domestic affairs[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2023 French pension reform strikes, Motions of no confidence in the government of Élisabeth Borne (2023), Nahel Merzouk riots, and 2023 French government reshuffle\n\nMacron's second presidential term began with two significant political controversies. Hours after the new Borne cabinet was announced, rape accusations against newly-appointed Minister for Solidarity Damien Abad were made public,[270] and on 28 May, the handling of the 2022 UEFA Champions League final chaos at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis drew criticism at home and abroad.[271]\n\n\nDespite its minority status in the legislature after the 2022 legislative election, Macron's government passed bills to ease the cost-of-living crisis,[272] to repeal the COVID-era \"state of health emergency\",[273] and to revive the French nuclear energy sector.[274] However, government proposals were defeated several times in the National Assembly[275] and by the end of 2022, the Borne cabinet had had to use the provisions of Article 49.3 of the Constitution ten times in a row to pass the 2023 Government Budget and Social Security Budget.[276]\n\n\n\n#### Pension reform[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2023, Macron's government passed a law raising the retirement age from 62 to 64, partly bypassing Parliament by again resorting to Article 49.3 to break the parliamentary deadlock.[277]\nNationwide protests that had begun when the bill was introduced back in January increased in intensity after the reform was passed without a solemn vote.[*citation needed*][*clarification needed*]\n\n\n\n#### Votes of no-confidence in the Borne government[edit]\n\n\nOn 20 March 2023, Macron's cabinet, headed by Prime minister Borne, survived a cross-party motion of no-confidence by only nine votes, the slimmest margin for such a vote since 1992.[278]\n\n\nOn 12 June 2023, his government survived its 17th no-confidence motion since the beginning of the 16th legislature; the motion, brought by the left-wing NUPES coalition, fell 50 votes short of the 289 votes needed.[279]\n\n\n\n#### Nahel Merzouk riots[edit]\n\n\nIn early summer 2023, French authorities faced riots following the killing of Nahel M., aged 17, by a police officer during a traffic stop. [280][281] To calm widespread unrest, comparable in intensity to the 2005 French riots[*citation needed*], Macron's administration ramped up government response, with a total of 45,000 police officers deployed on the ground and a ministerial order advising courts to apply harsher sentences and accelerated procedures:[282] this crackdown resulted in over 1,300 arrests on the fourth night of unrest alone, bringing the total number of arrests since the riots' beginning to over 2,000 as of 1 July.[283]\n\n\n\n#### 2023 government reshuffle[edit]\n\n\nOn 20 July 2023, Macron carried out a government reshuffle at the end of the \"hundred days of appeasement and action\" he called for in April 2023 following the violent protests surrounding the passage of his pension system reform. Pap Ndiaye and Marlène Schiappa were sacked as part of the reshuffle.[284]\n\n\n\n#### Defence policy[edit]\n\n\nOn 1 August 2023, Macron signed into law a multi-year military planning bill, which set the stage for a 40%-increase in military spending to a total of €413 billion between 2024 and 2030, after it was passed by the French parliament on 13 July 2023.[285][286]\n\n\n\n#### Immigration policy[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2023, Macron's government introduced an immigration & asylum bill aimed at removing deportation safeguards, fast-tracking asylum application process and immigration litigation, while also facilitating legalization of undocumented workers.[287] His government later pulled the draft legislation amid fears of defeat in Parliament, instead planning to hold talks with centre-right LR party before re-introducing the bill in the autumn.[288]\n\n\nIn August 2023, in a lengthy interview to weekly magazine Le Point, Macron said that France \"must significantly reduce immigration, starting with illegal immigration\" because the \"current situation is not sustainable\".[289]\n\n\n\n#### Constitutional reform[edit]\n\n\nOn the 65th anniversary of the French Constitution on 4 October 2023, Macron unveiled avenues for constitutional reform: broadening the scope and relaxing rules for referendums; enshrining the right to abortion and climate protection in the Constitution; stepping up the level of territorial devolution; giving some form of political autonomy to Corsica and New Caledonia.[290]\n\n\nIf it was to materialize, it would be Macron's first constitutional reform since taking office in 2017 since his previous attempts failed in Parliament.\n\n\n\n### External affairs[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Macron with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni in October 2022\n![](image)Macron, Ursula von der Leyen and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the 2023 France–China Summit\nOn 16 June 2022, Macron visited Ukraine alongside German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italy's Prime Minister Mario Draghi. He met with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and expressed \"European Unity\" for Ukraine.[291][292] He said that the nations that remained neutral in the Russo-Ukrainian War made a historic mistake and were complicit in the new imperialism.[293]\n\n\n\n![](image)Macron with Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in May 2023\nIn September 2022, Macron criticized the United States, Norway and other \"friendly\" natural gas supplier states for the extremely high prices of their supplies,[294] saying in October 2022 that Europeans are \"paying four times more than the price you sell to your industry. That is not exactly the meaning of friendship.\"[295]\n\n\nMacron and his wife attended the state funeral of Queen Elizabeth II in Westminster Abbey, London, on 19 September 2022.\n\n\nOn 23 October 2022, Macron became the first foreign leader to meet new Italian President of the Council Giorgia Meloni, just a day after she and her ministers were sworn into office.[296]\n\n\nDuring a summit to China with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, which included a formal meeting with Xi Jinping, the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and President of China, Macron called for Europe to reduce its dependence on the United States in general and to stay neutral and avoid being drawn into any possible confrontation between the U.S. and China over Taiwan. Speaking after a three-day state visit to China, Macron emphasised his theory of strategic autonomy, suggesting that Europe could become a \"third superpower\". He argued that Europe should focus on boosting its own defence industries and additionally reduce its dependence on the United States dollar (USD).[297] in a follow-up speech in The Hague to further outline his vision of strategic autonomy for Europe.[298] On 7 June 2023, a report by the pan-European think tank European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) found that most Europeans agree with Macron's views on China and the United States.[299]\n\n\nIn February 2023, he welcomed Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed in Paris to normalize relations between France and Ethiopia, strained by the Tigray War between the Ethiopian government and Tigray rebels.[300]\n\n\n\n![](image)Macron at the NATO Summit in Vilnius on 12 July 2023\nOn 31 May 2023 Macron visited the GLOBSEC forum in Bratislava, where he again delivered a speech on European sovereignty.[301] During the question and answer session that followed the Bratislava speech,[302] he said that negotiating with Putin may have to take priority over any war crimes tribunal which some others, including Zelensky, wish to see.[303]\n\n\nOn 12 June 2023, Macron promised to deliver more ammunition, weapons and armed vehicles to help Ukrainian forces with the ongoing counter-offensive to liberate Russian-occupied southeastern Ukraine.[304] At the NATO Summit in Vilnius, he promised to supply Ukraine with Scalp long-range cruise missiles to hit Russian targets deep behind the front lines.[305] On 10 November 2023, he said that what Russia is doing in Ukraine is \"imperialism and colonialism\" and it was the \"duty\" of France and other countries to help Ukraine defend itself, but added that maybe the time will come to hold fair peace negotiations and find a solution with Russia.[306]\n\n\n\n![](image)Macron with Israeli President Isaac Herzog in Jerusalem, Israel, 24 October 2023\nIn June 2023 Macron hosted a global climate finance conference described by many as the new Bretton Woods Conference. The purpose is to adjust the global economy to the contemporary threats of climate change and hunger. One of the proposition is to offer to low income countries help instead of credits so they can use their resource for stopping climate change and poverty instead of debt payments. Macron supported the idea, but a climate activist from Uganda remarked that the promises were meaningless if at the same time Makron supported projects like the East African Crude Oil Pipeline, a major threat to the climate and to the drinking water of 40 million people.[307] At the summit Macron proposed an international taxation system and debt restructuring but stressed it can have an effect only with international cooperation.[308]\n\n\nIn July 2023, Macron postponed his planned state visit to Germany due to the ongoing Nahel M. riots.[309]\n\n\nIn October 2023, Macron condemned Hamas' actions during the Israel–Hamas war and expressed his support to Israel and its right to self-defense.[310][311] He criticized Iran for its support of Hamas.[312] On 24 October, Macron visited Israel to express solidarity with the country. He said that the anti-ISIL coalition should also fight against Hamas.[313] On 10 November 2023, he called for a ceasefire and urged Israel to stop bombing Gaza and killing civilians.[314]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\n### Uber Files[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Uber Files\n\nOn 10 July 2022, *The Guardian* revealed that Macron had assisted Uber in lobbying during his term as the Minister of Economics and Industry,[315] leading to calls from opposition lawmakers for a parliamentary inquiry.[316][317] In his own defence, Macron expressed that he \"did his job\" and that he would \"do it again tomorrow and the day after tomorrow\".[317] He stated, \"I'm proud of it\".[317]\n\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Political positions of Emmanuel Macron\n\n## Co-prince of Andorra[edit]\n\n\nAs president of France, Macron also serves *ex officio* as one of the two co-princes of Andorra. His chief of staff Patrick Strzoda serves as his representative in this capacity. Joan Enric Vives i Sicília, appointed as the current Bishop of Urgell on 12 May 2003, serves as Macron's co-prince. Macron swore the Constitution of Andorra through Strzoda in an act that took place on 15 June 2017 in Casa de la Vall.[318]\n\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the Andorran government asked France for economic aid, but Macron refused, arguing that the Bank of France could not offer loans to another country without the approval of the European Central Bank.[319]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte Trogneux in 2017\nMacron is married to Brigitte Trogneux,[320] 24 years his senior,[321] and his former La Providence high school teacher in Amiens.[322][323] They met during a theatre workshop that she was giving when he was a 15-year-old student and she was a 39-year-old teacher.[324][325] His parents initially attempted to separate the couple by sending him away to Paris to finish the final year of his schooling, as they felt his youth made this relationship inappropriate.[14][325] The couple reunited after Macron graduated, and were married in 2007.[325] She has three children from a previous marriage; he has no children of his own.[326][*unreliable source?*] Trogneux's role in Macron's 2017 presidential campaign has been considered pivotal, with close Macron allies stating that Trogneux helped Macron to develop skills like public speaking.[327]\n\n\nHis best man was Henry Hermand (1924–2016), a businessman who loaned €550,000 to Macron for the purchase of his first apartment in Paris when he was Inspector of Finances. Hermand also let Macron use some of his offices on the Avenue des Champs Élysées in Paris for his movement En Marche.[328][329]\n\n\nIn the 2002 French presidential election, Macron voted for souverainist Jean-Pierre Chevènement.[330] In 2007, Macron voted for Ségolène Royal in the second round of the presidential election.[331] During the Socialist Party primary in 2011, Macron voiced his support for François Hollande.[332]\n\n\nMacron plays the piano,[333] and studied piano for ten years in his youth.[15] He especially enjoys the work of Robert Schumann and Franz Liszt.[334][335] Macron also skis,[336] plays tennis[337] and enjoys boxing.[338] In addition to his native French, Macron speaks fluent English.[339][340]\n\n\nIn August 2017, a photojournalist was arrested and detained by the police for six hours after he entered the private residence where Macron was vacationing in Marseille.[341] Macron subsequently filed a complaint for \"harassment\".[341] In September 2017, he dropped the complaint \"as a gesture of appeasement\".[342]\n\n\nOn 27 August 2017, Macron and his wife Brigitte adopted Nemo, a black Labrador Retriever-Griffon dog who lives with them in the Élysée Palace.[343] As a schoolboy, Macron decided to be baptized as a Catholic. In June 2018, prior to meeting Pope Francis, he identified himself as an agnostic Catholic.[344][345] In the same year he agreed to become an honorary canon of St John Lateran, the cathedral of Rome.[345]\n\n\n\n![](image)Macron celebrating France's victory over Croatia in the 2018 World Cup final in Moscow, Russia\nA fan of football, Macron is a supporter of French club Olympique de Marseille.[346] During the 2018 World Cup, he attended the semi-final between France and Belgium with the Belgian King Philippe and Queen Mathilde,[347] and at the World Cup final against Croatia, he sat and celebrated alongside Croatian president Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović. Macron received widespread media attention for his celebrations and his interactions with the Croatian president.[348][349][350][351][352]\n\n\nOn 17 December 2020, Macron tested positive for COVID-19[353] leading to the cancellation of his scheduled trips for the following month, including a visit to Lebanon.[354]\n\n\n\n## Honours and decorations[edit]\n\n\n### National honours[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Ribbon bar | Honour | Date and comment\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | Grand Master & Grand Cross of the National Order of the Legion of Honour | 14 May 2017 – automatic upon taking presidential office\n |\n| ![](image) | Grand Master & Grand Cross of the National Order of Merit | 14 May 2017 – automatic upon taking presidential office\n |\n\n\n### Foreign honours[edit]\n\n\n#### As President of the French Republic[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Ribbon bar | Country | Honour | Date\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) Netherlands | Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Netherlands Lion | 11 April 2023[355][356] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) United Arab Emirates | Collar of the Order of Zayed | 18 July 2022[357] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) Italy | Knight Grand Cross with Collar of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic | 1 July 2021[358] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) United States | Chief Commander of the Legion of Merit | 8 December 2020[359][*failed verification*] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) Egypt | Collar of the Order of the Nile | 7 December 2020[360] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) Ivory Coast | Grand Cross of the National Order of the Ivory Coast | 20 December 2019[359] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) Belgium | Grand Cordon of the Order of Leopold | 19 November 2018[359] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) South Korea | Grand Order of Mugunghwa | 8 October 2018[361] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) Finland | Grand Cross of the Order of the White Rose with Collar | 29 August 2018[362] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) Denmark | Knight of the Order of the Elephant | 28 August 2018[363] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) Luxembourg | Knight of the Order of the Gold Lion of the House of Nassau | 19 March 2018[359] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) Senegal | Grand Cross of the National Order of the Lion | 2 February 2018[359] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) Tunisia | Grand Cordon of the Order of the Republic of Tunisia | 31 January 2018[364] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) Lebanon | Grand Cross of the Order of Merit | 22 September 2017[359] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) Greece | Grand Cross of the Order of the Redeemer | 7 September 2017[365] |\n\n\n#### Prior to his presidency[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Ribbon bar | Country | Honour | Date\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) Mexico | Sash of the Order of the Aztec Eagle | 22 September 2016[366] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) United Kingdom | Honorary Commander of the Order of the British Empire | 5 June 2014[367] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) Brazil | Grand Officer of the Order of the Southern Cross | 9 December 2012[368] |\n\n\n## Prizes[edit]\n\n\n* *Le Trombinoscope* (2014, 2016)\n* Charlemagne Prize (2018)\n* Champion of the Earth (2018)\n* Westfälischer Friedenspreis [de] (2024)[369]\n\n\n## Publications[edit]\n\n\n* Macron, Emmanuel; Goldberg, Jonathan; Scott, Juliette (2017). *Revolution*.

Steinmeier was chairman-in-office of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) in 2016.\n\n\nSteinmeier is a member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), holds a doctorate in law and was formerly a career civil servant. He was a close aide of Gerhard Schröder when Schröder was Prime Minister of Lower Saxony during most of the 1990s, and served as Schröder's chief of staff from 1996. When Schröder became Chancellor of Germany in 1998, Steinmeier was appointed Under-Secretary of State in the German Chancellery with the responsibility for the intelligence services. From 1999 to 2005 he served as Chief of Staff of the Chancellery.\n\n\nFollowing the 2005 federal election, Steinmeier became Foreign Minister in the first grand coalition government of Angela Merkel, and from 2007 he additionally held the office of vice chancellor. In 2008, he briefly served as acting chairman of his party. He was the SPD's candidate for chancellor in the 2009 federal election, but his party lost the election and he left the federal cabinet to become leader of the opposition. Following the 2013 federal election, he again became Minister for Foreign Affairs in Merkel's second grand coalition. In November 2016 he was announced as the candidate for President of Germany of the governing coalition, consisting of his own party and the CDU/CSU, and thus became the presumptive electee, as the coalition held a large majority in the Federal Convention. He left the cabinet on 27 January 2017.[3] He was elected president by the Federal Convention on 12 February 2017 with 74% of the vote. On 13 February 2022, he was re-elected by the Federal Convention for a second and final term with 78% of the vote.[4]\n\n\nSteinmeier belongs to the right wing of the SPD, known as reformists and moderates.[5] As chief of staff, he was a principal architect of Agenda 2010, the Schröder government's reforms of the welfare state.[6] His lenient policies toward countries such as Russia and China have earned him criticism both in Germany and internationally, and he has been criticized for prioritizing German business interests over human rights.[7][8]\n\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nSteinmeier was born in 1956 in Detmold.[9] Although his full name is Frank-Walter, his friends call him Frank.[10] His father, a carpenter, was affiliated with the Church of Lippe (one of Germany's few Calvinist regional church bodies, and a member church of the Protestant Church of Germany). His mother, born in Breslau (now Wrocław, Poland), came as a refugee from a Lutheran part of Silesia during the flight and expulsion of Germans after World War II.[11]\n\n\nFollowing his *Abitur*, Steinmeier did his military service from 1974 to 1976, then studied law and political science at the Justus Liebig University Giessen, where Brigitte Zypries was a fellow student.[12] In 1982 he passed his first and in 1986 his second state examination in law. Steinmeier worked as a scientific assistant to the professor of public law and political science at Giessen University until he obtained his doctorate of law in 1991. His dissertation explored the state's role in preventing homelessness.[13]\n\n\n\n### Family life[edit]\n\n\nSteinmeier is married and has one daughter. On 24 August 2010, he donated a kidney to his wife, Elke Büdenbender.[14]\n\n\nIn 2015, Steinmeier served as best man at the wedding of Rüdiger Grube and Cornelia Poletto in Hamburg.[15]\n\n\n\n### Interests[edit]\n\n\nSteinmeier enjoys jazz, and is an avid football fan.[16]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nSteinmeier is a Reformed Protestant and an active member of the Reformed Bethlehem congregation in Berlin-Neukölln.[17] He was baptized into his father's church (the Church of Lippe) as a youth.\n\n\n\n### Early career[edit]\n\n\nSteinmeier became an adviser in 1991 for Law of Communication media and media guidelines in the State Chancellery of Lower Saxony in Hanover. In 1993, he became director of the Personal Office for the prime minister of Lower Saxony, Gerhard Schröder. In 1996, he became the Secretary of State and head of the State Chancellery of Lower Saxony.\n\n\n\n## Political career on federal level[edit]\n\n\n### Schröder Federal Chancellery, 1998–2005[edit]\n\n\nSteinmeier was appointed in November 1998 as Secretary of State, a junior Chancellery bureaucrat, and Commissioner for the Federal Intelligence Services at the office of the chancellor following Schröder's election victory. He replaced Bodo Hombach as the head of the office of the chancellor in 1999, after the later entered European Union politics.[18] He held onto his Secretary of State rank and therefore was the only Head of the Chancellery to not be appointed Minister for Special Affairs, i. e. does not have cabinet rank, from 1984 to today. During this period Steinmeier was also one of the advisors to Schröder.[18] He was crucial in securing a red-green majority in parliament for Schröder's contentious \"Agenda 2010\" of economic reforms.[5] Because of his effective management beyond the spotlight of politics, he was nicknamed *Die Graue Effizienz* (The Grey Efficiency) —a pun on *Graue Eminenz*, the German for éminence grise.\n\n\nAs Commissioner for the Federal Intelligence Services (a title often held by the Head of the Chancellery) Steinmeier was responsible for co-ordinating Germany's intelligence services.[19] In 2003, he supported Schröder in his controversial decision to forge a coalition with Russia and France against the U.S.-led war against Iraq.[20] Meanwhile, he approved the decision to install a German intelligence officer in the Qatar-based office of General Tommy Franks, the American commander of the U.S. invasion in Iraq, who passed on to the United States information being gathered in Baghdad by two German intelligence officers operating there.[21]\n\n\nIn 2004, Steinmeier participated in diplomatic negotiations settling on compensation payments with Libya for victims of the 1986 terrorist bombing of the LaBelle disco in Berlin.[22]\n\n\nA major controversy during Steinmeier's term as chief of staff was the imprisonment of a German-born Turk, Murat Kurnaz, in Guantánamo Bay from 2002 until August 2006. Steinmeier denied during a parliamentary inquiry in March 2007 that he had blocked Kurnaz's release. Instead, he claimed that Berlin had feared Kurnaz was a threat and should go to Turkey, not Germany, if released. Only after Merkel's election was Kurnaz released and brought back to Germany.[23]\n\n\n\n![](image)Frank-Walter Steinmeier (2009)\n### First term as Foreign Minister, 2005–2009[edit]\n\n\nOn 22 November 2005, after the 2005 federal elections, Steinmeier became Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Grand coalition cabinet led by Angela Merkel.[18] He was the first SPD Foreign Minister since Willy Brandt (1966–1969).\n\n\nUpon taking office, Steinmeier led the preparations for Germany taking over the rotating presidency of the Council of the European Union in the first half of 2007.\n\n\nFollowing Franz Müntefering's departure from the cabinet on 21 November 2007, Steinmeier also filled the position of Vice-Chancellor.[24]\n\n\nDuring his time in office, Steinmeier was widely regarded as having good working relations with Angela Merkel but often taking a different stance on foreign affairs.[5] By and large, he allowed Merkel to set the pace in foreign policy.,[19] working harmoniously with her on a range of foreign policy issues, from confronting Iran over its nuclear program to negotiating binding goals to combat climate change.[16] In one significant foreign-policy disagreement, Steinmeier held in 2009 that Germany should by 2013 lay the groundwork for withdrawing its troops from Afghanistan, a deployment that around two-thirds of Germans opposed by then.[25] Unlike Merkel, he also favored Turkish entry into the European Union.[16]\n\n\nAlso, Steinmeier became known for his rather Russia-friendly stance, arguing strenuously for engagement with the increasingly assertive power to the east, rather than its isolation.[26] He formulated a policy toward Russia deliberately reminiscent of \"Ostpolitik\", the eastward-facing policy pioneered by Chancellor Willy Brandt in the early 1970s.[27] Together with Gernot Erler, the SPD's leading Russia expert and the deputy foreign minister, Steinmeier initiated Germany's so-called Partnership for Modernization with Russia (announced in 2008), which became an official EU policy in 2010.[28]\n\n\nPressed by lawmakers to say more on his attitude toward Russia in the wake of the high-profile murders of opposition figures Anna Politkovskaya and Alexander Litvinenko at a 2007 hearing at the European Parliament, Steinmeier stated that \"[t]here is a certain trend toward [media] hysterics and one needs to get a sense of reason back into the debate\".[29] In May 2008, he became the first foreign official to hold talks with President Dmitri Medvedev and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin after they took up their new positions following the 2008 presidential elections.[30]\n\n\nIn 2006, *Foreign Affairs* published an analysis of the state of US and Russian nuclear forces, concluding that post-Cold War US nuclear forces seemed designed to carry out a preemptive strike against Russia or China and that the planned missile defense would be valuable primarily in an offensive context as an adjunct to a US first-strike capability.[31] The article elicited a semi-official Russian response from ex-PM Yegor Gaidar in the *Financial Times* a few days later.[32] In 2007, the US government reportedly was reportedly deeply irritated, although publicly silent, about Steinmeier, who had sounded supportive of Russian accusations that a planned US missile defense complex in Poland would upset the strategic balance in Europe – and who then left without challenge Russian General Nikolai Solovtsov's threat of retaliation against Poland and the Czech Republic if they deployed U.S. defensive systems.[33]\n\n\nRussian opposition activists later celebrated when Steinmeier and the SDP lost the 2009 election, signaling their discontent with Steinmeier. Oleg Petrovich Orlov, head of the Memorial human rights group, said that Steinmeier had prolonged Schröder's policies on Russia and that Germany's policies were \"extremely bad for civil society, democracy and the country as a whole\".[34]\n\n\nIn February 2009, Steinmeier became the first member of Merkel's cabinet to be received by the incoming Obama administration.[35]\n\n\nDuring his time in office, Steinmeier managed to extract German hostages from Iraq[36][37] and Yemen.[19] In 2007, he also succeeded in securing the release of a German citizen who was imprisoned in Iran for illegally entering the country's waters on a fishing expedition.[38]\n\n\nSteinmeier served as acting chairman of the SPD from 7 September 2008 to 18 October 2008. Domestically, throughout his term he was the only major politician with approval ratings consistently as high as or higher than Merkel's. This was helped by the especially high ratings foreign ministers generally receive in Germany.[26]\n\n\n\n### Opposition leader, 2009–2013[edit]\n\n\nOn 7 September 2008, following the resignation of SPD chairman Kurt Beck, Steinmeier was chosen as the SPD candidate for chancellor for the 2009 federal elections and also designated as acting SPD Chairman, pending the return of Müntefering to that position.[39] In his election campaign, he argued for new tax rules to deter high executive pay and bonuses, and for minimum wages to slow the growing gap between Germany's highest and lowest earners.[25] He also focused on improving public healthcare.[40]\n\n\n\n![](image)Germany's Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier addressing a dinner of the World Jewish Congress in Berlin, September 2014\nAfter the SPD's decisive defeat in the elections – the party's worst performance since World War II[41][42] by then – Steinmeier, who had been elected to represent Brandenburg an der Havel – Potsdam-Mittelmark I – Havelland III – Teltow-Fläming I, was elected Peter Struck's successor as chairman of the SPD's parliamentary group in the Bundestag, and as such leader of the opposition.[43] After a hospitalization for donating a kidney to his wife in August 2010, Steinmeier returned to his office in October 2010.\n\n\nDuring his time as leader of the parliamentary opposition, Steinmeier regularly accused Angela Merkel's government of increasing the national debt and pandering to the rich.[44] In 2011, Steinmeier argued that Merkel's decision to appoint her economics adviser, Jens Weidmann, to be the next head of Bundesbank undermined the political independence and public trust in the German central bank.[45]\n\n\nIn late 2012, Steinmeier was once again considered a possible candidate to challenge Chancellor Angela Merkel in the 2013 general election, but soon withdrew from the contest. As a consequence, SPD chairman Sigmar Gabriel later announced that the leadership agreed to nominate Peer Steinbrück.[46]\n\n\n\n### Second term as Foreign Minister, 2013–2017[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Steinmeier with John Kerry in March 2015\nAfter the elections of 2013 and the new grand coalition government, Steinmeier was appointed foreign minister for a second time in December 2013. He replaced Guido Westerwelle, who had signed the P5+1 accord with Iran in November 2013. His deputies are Michael Roth (SPD) and Maria Böhmer (CDU). Upon taking office, Steinmeier initiated an ambitious review of Germany's foreign policy, holding meetings nationwide and drawing in more than 12,000 people who work at the ministry or abroad.[47]\n\n\n\n![](image)Steinmeier with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in Tehran, February 2016\nOver the course of 2014, Steinmeier alternated with Merkel as Germany's most popular politician in polls of eligible voters.[48]\n\n\nIn light of criticism from the United States, Steinmeier stood firm on Germany's approach in the Ukraine conflict, where it was balancing support for European economic sanctions on Russia with leaving the door open to a revived partnership.[49] In May 2014, he proposed a greater mediation role for the OSCE, including the convening of local \"round table\" talks in Ukraine to defuse conflicts.[50] The **Steinmeier formula**, as it is known to readers of Russian media, is synonymous with the Minsk II agreement.[51] Between 2015 and 2016, Steinmeier hosted a series of Normandy format meetings in Berlin to negotiate a solution of the situation in the East of Ukraine.[52]\n\n\nDuring the Minsk II talks on a ceasefire for eastern Ukraine in early 2015, he successfully negotiated with Russian President Vladimir Putin on allowing German doctors to visit Ukrainian military pilot Nadiya Savchenko, who had been on hunger strike for more than two months in a Russian jail.[53] Steinmeier has repeatedly ruled out arms shipments to resolve the conflict,[54] and that was German policy until two days after the 24 February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, at which time Chancellor Olaf Scholz put an end to it.\n\n\nIn 2015, Steinmeier hosted a meeting of the delegations from Libya's two rival governments, who were battling for control of the country, and United Nations Special Representative Bernardino León to discuss a UN-sponsored peace and power-sharing proposal despite splits among some of the parties.[55]\n\n\nSteinmeier later was instrumental in convening the International Syria Support Group (ISSG) and the Syria peace talks in Vienna in October 2015, drawing together Saudi Arabia; its main regional rival, Iran; as well as Russia, the United States and other Western powers and regional actors including Turkey and Iraq.[56]\n\n\n\n### Political positions[edit]\n\n\n#### Human rights[edit]\n\n\nIn the past, *Human Rights Watch* has labeled Steinmeier as \"Realpolitik advocate\", for whom, \"when it comes to defining his relationship with countries\" such as Russia, China, Iran and Saudi Arabia, \"human rights play only a subordinate role\".[57][58]\n\n\nIn Steinmeier's opinion, the \"[r]ejection of capital punishment is one of the keystones of German human-rights policy. The death penalty goes against our fundamental ethic and moral principles\".[59] He personally called for the abolition of the death penalty in Uzbekistan; capital punishment in Uzbekistan has been abolished since 2008.[60] In April 2014, he summoned the Egyptian ambassador Mohamed Higazy after a Cairo court sentenced 683 individuals to death for inciting violence during protests in summer 2013, following the military overthrow of elected President Mohammed Morsi.[61] Following the 2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt, he warned that any move by Turkey to reinstate the death penalty would derail its efforts to join the European Union.[62] He criticized the 2016–present purges in Turkey.[63]\n\n\nIn response to the protests following the 2009 Iranian presidential election against the disputed victory of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Steinmeier condemned what he called \"brutal actions\" against demonstrators in Tehran and summoned the Iranian ambassador Alireza Sheikhattar to explain.[64]\n\n\n\n#### European integration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Steinmeier, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Polish President Lech Kaczyński in Brussels, June 2007\nAfter Germany had only narrowly managed to avoid a deficit warning from the European Commission in 2002, Schröder and Steinmeier became the driving forces behind weakening the Stability and Growth Pact, a rule-based framework for the coordination of national fiscal policies originally intended as the guarantor of a stable euro.[65]\n\n\nIn a joint article in the *Financial Times* on 14 December 2010, Steinmeier and Peer Steinbrück proposed to solve the European debt crisis with \"a combination of a haircut for debt holders, debt guarantees for stable countries and the limited introduction of European-wide bonds in the medium term, accompanied by more aligned fiscal policies\".[66] In February 2011, Steinmeier proposed Steinbrück as a candidate to lead the European Central Bank.[67]\n\n\nUnder Steinmeier's parliamentary leadership, the Social Democrats raised pressure on Chancellor Angela Merkel to agree to more burden-sharing to stem the euro zone crisis, repeatedly calling on her to assume greater risks to avert a breakup of the single currency.[68] In both February and November 2012, his parliamentary group voted largely in favour of the Merkel government's proposal for eurozone bailout packages for Greece,[69][70][71] while criticizing the measures as being \"not an enduring solution for the Greeks\".[72] In July 2014, he helped build the opposition's support for a euro zone rescue package for Spanish banks.[73] Later, as foreign minister, he publicly advised against \"frivolous\" talk of a Greek withdrawal from the eurozone, calling for a serious search for a solution.[74]\n\n\nReacting to a growth of euro-skeptic political parties across Europe by early 2014, Steinmeier offered the United Kingdom limited support on renegotiating the Treaties of the European Union, saying Germany wanted to see Britain's influence in the \"midst\" of the EU, not on \"the sidelines\".[75] After Britain's vote to leave the EU in 2016, he argued that the union lacked the cohesion to undertake major new integration steps and should instead focus on migration, high youth unemployment and security.[76]\n\n\nAt the same time, Steinmeier worked to develop new formats and revive new ones. In December 2014, he met with the foreign ministers from the three Nordic countries Denmark, Finland and Sweden – Margot Wallström, Erkki Tuomioja and Martin Lidegaard – for the so-called \"N3 + 1\" format to discuss issues of common concern for the first time.[77]\n\n\nIn August 2016, he joined French foreign minister Jean-Marc Ayrault in pledging to \"reinvigorate\" the Weimar Triangle and published a document 'A strong Europe in a world of uncertainties'.[78]\n\n\nBetween 2014 and 2016, he visited the three Baltic states – Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania – six times, the highest number of visits by any German Foreign Minister.[79][80]\n\n\nAlso in late 2014, Steinmeier and his British counterpart Philip Hammond united in a bid to end a deadlock in relations between Bosnia and the European Union, arguing that the EU should abandon its insistence on changes to Bosnia's electoral code as a precondition for a Stabilization and Association Agreement on the path to EU membership.[81]\n\n\n\n#### Energy policy[edit]\n\n\nIn 2007, Steinmeier said he opposes European Commission proposals on unbundling the ownership of energy networks in the European Union, as it was proposed in the Third Energy Package.[82]\n\n\n\n#### Relations with France[edit]\n\n\nOn 14 May 2014, Steinmeier became the first German foreign minister to attend a meeting of the French cabinet.[83] Together with his French counterpart Laurent Fabius, he flew on several joint diplomatic missions between 2014 and 2015, including to Moldova, Georgia,[84] Tunisia, Nigeria and Bangladesh. In 2016, he joined Fabius' successor Jean-Marc Ayrault for trips to Ukraine, Libya,[85] Mali[86] and Niger.[87]\n\n\n\n#### Relations with Russia[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Steinmeier with Vladimir Putin, March 2016\nIn May 2007, the daily *Financial Times Deutschland* reported that Steinmeier had served as mediator in the so-called Bronze Night controversy, an Estonia-Russia dispute over the removal of a Red Army memorial in Tallinn. According to the report, Steinmeier suggested the Estonian ambassador to Russia, Marina Kaljurand, go on vacation in an effort to calm the situation. Steinmeier called his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov to suggest not only that Kaljurand take a holiday, but also that Russia drop the dispute for the time being. After speaking with Lavrov, Steinmeier reportedly called Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Paet and got him to agree to the deal. Kaljurand left Moscow for a two-week vacation and pro-Kremlin youth activists blockading the Estonian embassy in Moscow ended their protests the same day.[88]\n\n\nUpon returning to government in late 2013, Steinmeier criticized Russia in his inaugural speech for exploiting Ukraine's economic plight to prevent it from signing the Ukraine–European Union Association Agreement.[89] In March 2014, he defended Russia's membership of the G8, saying \"The format of the G8 is actually the only one in which we in the West can speak directly with Russia.\"[90] When Germany held the chairmanship of the group in 2015, he maintained that excluding Russia over its actions in Ukraine was a necessary step but not a goal in itself; citing the Middle East, he argued that \"a look at the world shows that we need Russia as a constructive partner in a number of conflicts\".[91]\n\n\nIn a 2015 letter to Cecilia Malmström, the EU's trade chief, Steinmeier proposed a joint declaration between the EU and Russia offering Moscow the prospect of long-sought investment and energy concessions to create a more integrated economic area from the Atlantic to the Pacific. According to the letter, \"by the content of this declaration we could respond to Russia's wishes and begin a closer exchange of views on energy and investment protection issues, even if the Ukraine–European Union Association Agreement does not directly touch on them\".[92]\n\n\nIn June 2016, Steinmeier criticised NATO 'warmongering' on Russia: \"The one thing we shouldn't do now is inflame the situation with loud sabre-rattling and warmongering.\"[93] The CDU politicians Volker Bouffier and Herbert Reul criticised him for his stance on Russia,[8] while his comments were welcomed by the Russian media.[94]\n\n\nIn their book *Die Moskau-Connection*, journalists Bingener and Wehner describe the network around Schröder and his support for Putin's policies. Steinmeier was part of that network. Bingener and Wehner write that Steinmeier considered Putin to be rational and accessible. Steinmeier also did not draw any conclusions from the annexation of Crimea in February 2014.[95] Steinmeier did not resolutely oppose Putin's logic, in which there is only winning and losing. Bingener and Wehner:[96]\n\n\n\n\n> This is another reason why he is well-liked in Moscow. He is a rather timid person. While his predecessor Joschka Fischer got along with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov easily and often interrupted his suades, Steinmeier has a hard time speaking to Lavrov. 'Dear Sergei', as Steinmeier sometimes calls him, is often harsh and hurtful to his interlocutors. He doesn't need to be that with the German Foreign Minister.\n> \n> \n\n\n#### Relations with the United States[edit]\n\n\nSteinmeier voiced his support for Barack Obama when Obama was still a presidential candidate, and supported Obama's wish to deliver a speech before the iconic Brandenburg Gate during the 2008 U.S. presidential campaign.[97]\n\n\nIn 2016 Steinmeier described then-U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump as a \"hate preacher\".[98][99][100] After Trump's election, Steinmeier refused to congratulate him, and condemned Trump's views.[101][102] He has been described as \"the German government's most strident detractor\" of Trump.[103]\n\n\n\n#### Relations with Central Asia[edit]\n\n\nDuring a 2006 meeting with Turkmen President Saparmurat Niyazov, Steinmeier criticized Turkmenistan for its slow progress in implementing the rule of law and human rights and said that the state's progress in carrying out political reforms had been \"too halting\".[104]\n\n\nWhen Germany chaired a United Nations group aimed at resolving 2008 Russo-Georgian diplomatic crisis, Steinmeier presented to the three conflict parties – Georgia, Abkhazia and Russia – a plan which included a three-stage peace proposal, entailing an end to violence, confidence-building measures over the following year that could lead to the resumption of direct talks between Georgia and Abkhazia, and the return of about 250,000 Georgian refugees to Abkhazia. However, both Georgia and Abkhazia rejected the proposal.[105] In September 2008, Steinmeier called for an international probe into the conflict over Georgia's breakaway provinces.[106] During a 2014 visit to the country, he reiterated that membership of NATO and of the EU would remain off the cards for a long while to come.[107]\n\n\nIn August 2006, Steinmeier made his first visit to Afghanistan, where Germany had taken over the command of the 21,000-strong NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) shortly before.[108] Ahead of the 2009 federal elections, Steinmeier – then still in his capacity as foreign minister – commissioned an internal report on Germany's engagement in Afghanistan which recommended that Germany should start pulling out of the country within four years; at the time, this was seen as a stark departure from Steinmeier's earlier insistence Germany should not set a date for withdrawing its then 4,200-strong contingent from the north of Afghanistan as the move could play into the hands of Taliban insurgents.[109]\n\n\nIn October 2014, Steinmeier visited both Armenia and Azerbaijan to facilitate a negotiated solution to the long-standing conflict over Nagorny Karabakh, a region of Azerbaijan controlled by ethnic Armenians.[110] In 2016, he returned to both countries to in his capacity as chairman of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) to reinvigorate the talks.[111]\n\n\n\n#### Israeli–Palestinian conflict[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Steinmeier and Israeli President Reuven Rivlin in Jerusalem, July 2021\nIn the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, Steinmeier supports a two-state solution and calls for an end to the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories. He welcomed the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334 and said the Israeli settlements on occupied territory form an obstacle to peace and a two-state solution.[112] He further said that \"a democratic Israel is achievable only through a two-state-solution\".[113] Steinmeier praised the speech by US Secretary of State John Kerry which outlined the United States' position on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict in December 2016; in the speech Kerry said a peace agreement must be based on the 1967 lines, that all citizens must enjoy equal rights, that occupation must end, that the Palestinian refugee issue must be resolved, and that Jerusalem must be the capital of both states, and criticised the Netanyahu government's agenda as driven by \"extreme elements\".[114]\n\n\n\n#### Relations with Iran[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The ministers of foreign affairs and diplomats announcing an Iran nuclear deal framework in Lausanne in April 2015\nSteinmeier is a staunch proponent of the Iran nuclear deal framework, and has called the agreement \"an opening for further diplomatic endeavors\".[115]\n\n\n\n#### Relations with the Arab world[edit]\n\n\nSteinmeier has visited the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan twice to learn more about the plight of Syrians fleeing the violence in the ongoing Syrian civil war that erupted in 2011,[116] first in his capacity as chairman of the SPD parliamentary group in May 2013 and later as foreign minister in May 2015.[117] In early 2014, upon taking office as foreign minister, he agreed with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen that Germany would help destroy Syria's arsenal of chemical weapons materials as part of an international disarmament program.[118] In October 2014, he co-chaired the Berlin Conference on the Syrian Refugee Situation along with Development Minister Gerd Müller and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, António Guterres.[119]\n\n\nIn March 2015, Steinmeier said he \"can understand\" Saudi Arabia's decision to mount a military intervention in Yemen and acknowledged the operation had \"support from the region\". However, he said the crisis could not be solved by violence and urged a negotiated solution.[120]\n\n\n\n#### Relations with Greece[edit]\n\n\nIn 2015 Steinmeier rejected claims for war reparations from the Greek Syriza party in response to Germany's position on the Greek government-debt crisis. When incoming Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, in his first major speech to parliament in early 2015, pledged to seek war reparations from Germany, Steinmeier replied to Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Kotzias that Germany was fully aware of its political and moral responsibility for the \"terrible events\" in Greece between 1941 and 1944 when German troops occupied the country. \"Still, we are firmly convinced that all reparations issues, including forced loans, are judicially settled once-and-for-all,\" Steinmeier said.[121]\n\n\n\n### Controversies[edit]\n\n\n#### Refusal to meet with Dalai Lama[edit]\n\n\nSteinmeier openly attacked Merkel over her 2007 meeting with the Dalai Lama, accusing the chancellor of \"playing to public opinion\" without regard for the effectiveness of the meeting in improving political or religious rights on the ground in China.[122] In 2008, he refused to meet the Dalai Lama during his five-day visit, arguing that such a meeting could undermine international efforts to promote sustained contact between China and Tibet.[123] Instead, Steinmeier issued the statement \"it takes a lot of courage not to meet with the Dalai Lama these days\",[124] which *The New York Times* described as \"extraordinarily cynical\" and accused Steinmeier of prioritizing business interests over human rights.[7][125]\n\n\n\n#### Murat Kurnaz torture case[edit]\n\n\nIn the case of Murat Kurnaz, innocently imprisoned in 2002 and tortured by the US, Steinmeier allegedly had an offer by the United States Department of Defense and the CIA already in September 2002 regarding a transfer of Murat Kurnaz to Germany, where he was born and raised. Kurnaz had been first sold as a terror suspect in Pakistan, then imprisoned in Afghanistan and later in Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba, until 2006. By refusing the offer Steinmeier is thought to have been politically directly responsible for his continued imprisonment.[126][127][128]\n\n\nA BND-commission of enquiry was consulted.[129]\n\n\n\n#### Armenian genocide denial[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Armenian Genocide denial\n\nDuring a 2015 debate about Germany's recognition of the Armenian genocide on the occasion of its centenary, Steinmeier was the politician most reluctant to endorse it, mainly because of Germany's relations with Turkey.[130] He was widely criticized for his position and accused of Armenian genocide denial.[131][132] When the German Bundestag almost unanimously approved a resolution in 2016 that recognises the killings of up to 1.5 million Armenians by Ottoman forces as a genocide, a description that Turkey strongly rejects, Steinmeier abstained from the vote and criticized the resolution in public; Steinmeier was one of only two of the 630 members of parliament who did not support the resolution.[133] And Steinmeier alleged that calling Armenian massacres genocide risks belittling the Holocaust.[134]\n\n\n\n#### Plagiarism allegations[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the 2013 elections, Steinmeier became the first prominent member of the Social Democrats to be confronted with allegations that he plagiarized parts of his 1991 doctoral dissertation about the role of the state in the prevention of homelessness.[13] Similar accusations had previously led to the resignation of two ministers of the Merkel government.[13] In response, Steinmeier rejected the charges and said that he had asked the University of Giessen to check his dissertation for unacknowledged citations.[13] In May 2013, a university committee for safeguarding academic practices found that Steinmeier had no fraudulent intent and had not committed academic misconduct in his dissertation.[135] The committee did find \"technical weaknesses\" in Steinmeier's citations, but said they were not severe enough to consider revoking his degree.[135]\n\n\n\n## Presidency (2017–present)[edit]\n\n\n### Candidacy for President[edit]\n\n\nPresident Joachim Gauck announced in June 2016 that he would not run for re-election, resulting in a search for a candidate to succeed him.[136] In November 2016, Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives agreed with the Social Democrats to support Steinmeier's candidacy for president in the presidential election, scheduled for 12 February 2017.[137]\n\n\nMerkel had originally wanted to nominate Green politician Marianne Birthler, and as the CDU/CSU and the Greens control a majority in the Federal Convention, Birthler's election would have been secured. However, Birthler after some time decided not to run.[138]\n\n\nOn 12 February 2017 Germany's 16th Federal Convention elected Steinmeier President on the first ballot, with 931 votes out of a total of 1,260.\n\n\nSteinmeier took office as President of Germany on 19 March 2017, after the expiration of his predecessor's term in office, and on 22 March 2017 he took the oath that newly invested presidents must take before a joint session of the Bundestag and the Bundesrat, according to the Basic Law.\n\n\n\n### German federal election 2017[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Steinmeier with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko in Kyiv, May 2018\nFollowing the federal election in September 2017, coalition talks began between the Christian Democratic Union, Christian Social Union, Free Democratic Party and the Green Party. The talks continued for 4 weeks until just past midnight on 20 November when the Free Democrats and their leader Christian Lindner walked out of the talks and they subsequently collapsed.[139] The collapse of the talks left another Grand Coalition as the only coalition with a majority in the Bundestag; this however seemed difficult, as the Leader of the Social Democratic Party Martin Schulz[140] had ruled out another Grand Coalition on multiple occasions. \n\n\nIn the following weeks, Steinmeier played an important role in the formation of the next government. This is because if the Bundestag fails to elect a chancellor in 14 days of voting,[141] the president can either appoint the individual with most votes to lead a minority government or dissolve the Bundestag and call new elections. This type of political crisis had never been seen in Germany before and pushed the president into a quite powerful position which is rare for Germany. Steinmeier declared he would not consider a dissolution of the Bundestag as a preferable solution, and managed to persuade Schulz to meet with Angela Merkel and start preliminary talks. After long coalition talks, CDU, CSU and SPD formed a new grand coalition. Merkel was re-elected in the Bundestag on 14 March 2018.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### 2022 re-election[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Steinmeier with Finnish prime minister Sanna Marin in Helsinki, April 2022\nOn 13 February 2022 he was re-elected as president.[142]\n\n\n\n#### Ukraine controversy[edit]\n\n\nShortly after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Steinmeier expressed regret for his earlier stance on Russia, saying his years of support for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline had been a clear mistake.[143] In April 2022 he called for a war crimes tribunal against Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.[144] Steinmeier said that he \"wrongly believed that Vladimir Putin would not precipitate a complete economic, political, and moral devastation of his country because of his imperial mania.\"[145]\n\n\nIn April 2022, Steinmeier abandoned plans to visit Kyiv after admitting he would not be welcome in Ukraine in what was seen as a serious snub for one of Germany's senior politicians. At the time, German news media cited Ukrainian officials as saying that the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky would refuse to meet Steinmeier if he came to Kyiv.[146] Ukraine had previously criticized Steinmeier for his connections to Russia and his role in strengthening German-Russian relations under the *Wandel durch Handel* policy.[147]\n\n\nOn 25 October 2022, Steinmeier made an official visit to Ukraine, after a scheduled visit on 20 October was cancelled for security reasons due to a wave of cruise missile and drone attacks across Ukraine.[148][149][150] At the time, DW News was talking about a new 350bn euro Marshall Plan to aid Ukraine even while Russian bombs were still falling from Kyiv skies.[149] Upon his return to Berlin he spoke at length of his Ukrainian experiences on 28 October, and opened with vivid descriptions of the horrors of war, noting that it had caused \"the deepest crisis\" that a reunified Germany has seen. He warned that \"tougher, rough years are ahead of us.\"[151]\n\n\nOn 29 November 2022 Steinmeier was interviewed in his palace again on this subject by a journalist from Deutsche Welle. He condemned Russia's recent attacks on civilians and on gas and electricity supplies in Ukraine, \"A cease-fire now would mean Russia would keep the territories it has occupied.. It is also reckless to suggest a cease-fire now, because to establish a cease-fire at this point in time would essentially condone all of the injustice that has already taken place.\" He thought it early yet to talk about security guarantees for Ukraine.[152]\n\n\n\n### Presidential visits to foreign countries[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of presidential trips made by Frank-Walter Steinmeier\n\n## Other activities[edit]\n\n\n* German Coordinating-Council for Christian-Jewish Cooperation Organizations, member of the board (2009–2013)\n* Friedrich Ebert Foundation (FES), member[153]\n* German Protestant Church Assembly, member of the board\n* German Protestant Institute of Archaeology, member of the board\n* International Journalists' Programmes, member of the board of trustees\n* Peace of Westphalia Prize, member of the jury[154]\n* Rudolf Pichlmayr Foundation for Organ Transplantation, member of the board[155]\n* Aktion Deutschland Hilft (Germany's Relief Coalition), member of the board of trustees (−2017)[156]\n* Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, ex-officio member of the board of trustees (−2017)\n* KfW, ex-officio member of the supervisory board (−2017)\n\n\n## Recognition[edit]\n\n\n### Honorary appointment[edit]\n\n\n* Honorary doctorate of the Ural State Technical University, Russia (2010)\n* Willy Brandt Prize (2013)\n* Honorary citizen of Reims (2015)[157]\n* Honorary doctorate of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel (2015)[158]\n* Honorary doctorate of the University of Piraeus, Greece (2015)[159]\n* Honorary doctorate of the University of Paderborn (2016)[160]\n* Toleranzpreis der Evangelischen Akademie Tutzing (2016)\n* Ignatz Bubis Award (2017)[161]\n* World Food Programme's Hunger Hero Award (2017)[162]\n* Honorary doctorate of the Lebanese University (2018)[163]\n* Leo Baeck Medal (2021)[164]\n* Henry A.

He served as Minister for Parliamentary Relations from 1987 to 1989, and Minister of Education from 1989 to 1990. In 1994, Mattarella was among the founders of the Italian People's Party (PPI), serving as Deputy Prime Minister of Italy from 1998 to 1999, and Minister of Defence from 1999 to 2001. He joined The Daisy in 2002 and was one of the founders of the Democratic Party (PD) in 2007, leaving it when he retired from politics in 2008. He also served as a judge of the Constitutional Court of Italy from 2011 to 2015.[2]\n\n\nOn 31 January 2015, Mattarella was elected to the presidency on the fourth ballot, supported by the centre-left coalition majority led by the PD and centrist parties.[3] He was re-elected for a second term on 29 January 2022, becoming the second Italian president to be re-elected, the first being Napolitano.[4] As of 2023, five prime ministers have served under his presidency, among them Matteo Renzi, then the PD's leader and main sponsor of his presidential candidacy,[5] Paolo Gentiloni, a leading member of the PD who succeeded Renzi after his resignation in 2016,[6] Giuseppe Conte, at that time an independent politician who governed both with right-wing and left-wing coalitions in two consecutive cabinets,[7] Mario Draghi, a banker and former president of the European Central Bank, who was appointed by Mattarella to lead a national unity government following Conte's resignation,[8] and Giorgia Meloni, first ever female prime minister and leader of the right-wing coalition which won the general election in September 2022.[9]\n\n\nDuring his long-time tenure, Italy faced the aftermath of the Great Recession, as well as the severe European migrant crisis, which deeply marked Italian political, economic and social life, bringing to the rise of populist parties.[10] Moreover, in 2020, Italy became one of the countries worst affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, being the first country in the Western world to implement a national lockdown to stop the spread of the disease.[11][12]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sergio Mattarella with his father Bernardo Mattarella in 1963\nMattarella was born in Palermo on 23 July 1941 into a prominent Sicilian family. His father Bernardo Mattarella was an anti-fascist who, alongside Alcide De Gasperi and other Catholic politicians, founded Christian Democracy (DC), which dominated the Italian political scene for almost fifty years, with Bernardo serving as a minister several times. Bernardo Mattarella has also been accused of being associated with the Sicilian Mafia; however, accusations were always rejected in court.[13][14] His mother Maria Buccellato came from an upper-middle-class family of Trapani.[15][16]\n\n\nDuring his youth, Mattarella moved to Rome due to his father's commitments to politics. In Rome, he became a member of Azione Cattolica (AC), a large Catholic lay association, of which he became the regional chairman for Lazio from 1961 to 1964.[17] After attending Istituto San Leone Magno, a classical lyceum (*liceo classico*) in Rome,[18] he studied law at the Sapienza University of Rome, where he joined the Italian Catholic Federation of University Students (FUCI).[19]\n\n\nIn 1964, Mattarella graduated with merit with the thesis *The Function of Political Direction*.[20] In 1967, he became a lawyer in Palermo, becoming particularly involved in administrative law.[21] After a few years, Mattarella started teaching parliamentary procedure at the University of Palermo, where he remained until 1983. His academic activity and publications during this period mainly concerned constitutional law topics, the intervention of Sicilian government in economy, bicameralism, legislative procedure, expropriation allowance, evolution of the Sicilian regional administration, and controls on local authorities.[22]\n\n\nIn 1966, Mattarella married Marisa Chiazzese, daughter of Lauro Chiazzese, former rector of the University of Palermo, with whom he had three children: Laura, Francesco, and Bernardo.[23] On 6 January 1980, his older brother Piersanti Mattarella, who was also a DC politician and president of Sicily since 1978, was killed by the Sicilian Mafia in Palermo.[24] This event deeply changed Mattarella's life, and he left his academic career to enter politics.[25]\n\n\n\n## Political career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mattarella's first portrait as a deputy in 1983\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | This article is part of a series aboutSergio Mattarella |\n\n |\n| * **Offices**Minister for Parliamentary Relations (1987–89)Minister of Public Education (1989–90)Deputy Prime Minister of Italy (1998–99)Minister of Defence (1999–2001)Judge of the Constitutional Court (2011–15)President of Italy (2015–present)\n\n\n\n---\n\n* **Member of the Chamber of Deputies**\n* Italian electoral law of 1993\n\n\n\n---\n\n* **Minister of Defence**\n* Kosovo War\n\t+ NATO bombing\n* Abolition of conscription\n\n\n\n---\n\n* **President of Italy**Incumbent\n* Presidential elections (2015, 2022)\n* General elections (2018, 2022)\n* Referendums (2016, 2020)\n* Government formations (2016, 2018, 2019, 2021, 2022)\n* Government crisis (2019, 2021, 2022)\n* COVID-19 pandemic\n* 2020 lockdowns\n* Quirinal Treaty\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nCabinets\n* Renzi\n* Gentiloni\n* Conte I\n* Conte II\n* Draghi\n* Meloni\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n![](image) |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\nOne of the first important positions that Mattarella held was the head of the board of arbitrators of the DC, quickly reconstituted at the end of 1981 following the Propaganda Due scandal and the establishment of the related parliamentary commission of inquiry, chaired by Tina Anselmi. The internal body of the party had been charged with identifying the militants registered in the Masonic lodge of Licio Gelli to expel or suspend them, having violated the statute of the party that prohibited registration to Masonic lodges.[26] Mattarella's parliamentary career began in 1983, when he was elected member of the Chamber of Deputies with nearly 120,000 votes in the constituency of Palermo.[27] As a deputy, Mattarella joined the left-leaning faction of the DC known as *morotei*. The faction, close to Aldo Moro,[28] supported an agreement with the Italian Communist Party (PCI) led by Enrico Berlinguer, the so-called Historic Compromise; his brother Piersanti Mattarella also supported it.[29][30]\n\n\nIn 1982, *Cosa Nostra* killed the PCI regional secretary Pio La Torre and the prefect of Palermo Carlo Alberto dalla Chiesa. These tragic events shook the credibility of the regional political system dominated by DC. In the following year, Mattarella was entrusted by Ciriaco De Mita, the DC secretary, to \"clean up\" the Sicilian branch of the party from Mafia control, at a time when mafia made men like Salvo Lima and Vito Ciancimino were powerful political figures in the region.[31] In 1985, he helped the young lawyer Leoluca Orlando, who had worked alongside his brother Piersanti during his governorship of Sicily, to become the new mayor of Palermo; the two men set out to break the Mafia's hold on the island, transferring budget authority from the corrupt regional government back to the cities and passing a law enforcing the same building standards used in the rest of Italy, thereby making the Mafia's building schemes illegal.[32] In 1987, Mattarella was re-elected to the Chamber of Deputies with more than 143,000 votes,[33] remaining close to the left-leaning faction of the party as well as to its secretary De Mita.[34]\n\n\n\n### Minister and lawmaker[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 1993 Italian referendum and Italian electoral law of 1993\n\nOn 29 July 1987, Mattarella was appointed Italian Minister for Parliamentary Relations in the government led by the DC prime minister Giovanni Goria.[35] The government lasted until April 1988, when De Mita was sworn in as new prime minister; however, Mattarella was confirmed as minister.[36]\n\n\nIn March 1989, a maxi-competition for professorships was held for the secondary school. Mattarella reorganized also the teaching programs of two-year high schools, completing the first steps of the so-called \"Brocca project\", the educational system's revision program, undertaken under his predecessor Giovanni Galloni in 1988.[37] Mattarella also oversaw the overall reform of the elementary school, which made the three teachers' module on two classes universal on 23 May 1990, leading to the overcoming of the traditional single teacher.[38]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mattarella in 1994\nOn 23 July 1989, Mattarella became Italian Minister of Education in the sixth cabinet of Giulio Andreotti.[39] In January 1990, Mattarella led the first National School Conference, which discussed the renewal of the educational system and addressed the issue of school autonomy.[40] At the end of June 1990, the so-called \"anti-drug law\" was approved, which mandated health education to schools; the combination of the education system and preventive measures, not only in health matters, was part of the programmatic lines that the minister had drawn. On 27 July 1990, Mattarella resigned from his position, together with other ministers, upon the Italian Parliament's passing in 1990 of the Mammì Act, liberalising the media in Italy, which they saw as a favour to the media magnate Berlusconi.[41]\n\n\nIn 1990, Mattarella was elected deputy secretary of the DC. He left the post two years later to become director of *Il Popolo*, the official newspaper of the party.[41] Following the 1993 Italian referendum, he drafted the new electoral law nicknamed *Mattarellum*.[42] The electoral law consisted in a parallel voting system, which act as a mixed system, with 75% of seats allocated using a first-past-the-post electoral system and 25% using proportional representation, with one round of voting.[43][44]\n\n\nDuring those years in the early 1990s, the whole Italian political system was shocked by the *Tangentopoli* corruption scandal;[45] Mattarella was not directly involved in the scandal. In August 1993, he was among the recipients of an investigation's notification that followed the statements of a Sicilian real estate entrepreneur, who accused him. Mattarella resigned from all his posts and was thanked by Mino Martinazzoli, the then DC leader, who expressed his support to him. Martinazzoli's statement was publicly criticized by Francesco Cossiga because it was in contrast with what was done for other politicians involved in the scandal. Mattarella was later acquitted of the charge.[46]\n\n\n\n### Minister within the centre-left[edit]\n\n\nMattarella was one of the protagonists of the renewal of the DC after *Tangentopoli* that would lead in January 1994 to the foundation of the Italian People's Party (PPI).[41] In the ensuing 1994 Italian general election, in which the newly founded PPI fared poorly, Mattarella was again elected to the Chamber of Deputies.[47] He soon found himself engaged in an internal dispute after the election of new party leader Rocco Buttiglione, who wished to steer the PPI towards an electoral alliance with Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia (FI).[41] Following Buttiglione's appointment, Mattarella resigned as director of *Il Popolo* in opposition to this policy.[48] In a 20 July 1994 interview with *l'Unità*, Mattarella considered the new political proposal that was taking shape for a new centre-left coalition interesting, \"especially for those who are very nostalgic for Aldo Moro's political strategy.\"[49] In 1995, at the height of the internal conflict within the PPI, he addressed Buttiglione, who was stubbornly seeking an alliance with the political right, as \"el general coup leader Roquito Butillone\" and defined \"an irrational nightmare\" the hypothesis that Berlusconi's FI could be accepted into the European People's Party.[50]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mattarella with the U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen in March 2000\nMattarella was one of the first supporters of the economist Romano Prodi at the head of the centre-left coalition known as The Olive Tree in the 1996 Italian general election. After the electoral victory of the centre-left, Mattarella served as leader of the PPI's parliamentary group.[51] Two years later, when the Prodi I Cabinet fell, Mattarella was appointed by Massimo D'Alema as Deputy Prime Minister of Italy with responsibility for the secret services, which he tried to reform. The reform of the secret services proposed by Mattarella collected the indications provided by the Jucci Commission, which had worked extensively on the subject, and aimed at strengthening the political control of the services by the prime minister of Italy, in coordination with the Digis (Government Department of Security Information), by removing power from the Interior Ministry and Defense.[52] It was the basis for the 2007 reform of the secret services.[53]\n\n\nIn December 1999, Mattarella was appointed Italian Minister of Defence in the D'Alema II Cabinet. As Minister of Defence, he supported the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia against the Serbian president Slobodan Milošević; he also approved a reform of the Italian Armed Forces which abolished conscription. After the resignation of D'Alema in 2000, Mattarella kept his position as Minister of Defence in the Amato II Cabinet.[41]\n\n\nIn October 2000, the PPI joined with other centrist parties to form an alliance called The Daisy (DL), later to merge into a single party in March 2002. Mattarella was re-elected to the Italian Parliament in the 2001 and 2006 general elections, standing as a candidate for The Daisy in two successive centre-left coalitions: The Olive Tree and The Union (*L'Unione*).[47] In 2007, Mattarella was one of the founders of the Democratic Party (PD), a big tent centre-left party formed from a merger of left-wing and centrist parties which had been part of The Olive Tree, including The Daisy and the Democrats of the Left (heirs of the PCI).[41]\n\n\nOn 5 October 2011, Mattarella was elected by the Italian Parliament with 572 votes to be a judge of the Constitutional Court of Italy. He was sworn in on 11 October 2011 and served until he was sworn in as President of the Italian Republic in January 2015.[54][47]\n\n\n\n## President of Italy (2015–present)[edit]\n\n\n### First term (2015–2022)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)First term's official portrait\n![](image)Mattarella with his predecessor Giorgio Napolitano\nOn 31 January 2015, Mattarella was elected the president of Italy at the fourth ballot with 665 votes out of 1,009, with support from the Democratic Party (PD), New Centre-Right, Civic Choice, Union of the Centre, and Left Ecology Freedom.[55][56] Mattarella was officially endorsed by the PD after his name was put forward by Matteo Renzi, the prime minister of Italy at the time.[57] He replaced Giorgio Napolitano, who had served for nine years, the longest presidency in the history of the Italian Republic; since Napolitano had resigned on 14 January, Senate president Pietro Grasso was the Acting President at the time of Mattarella's inauguration on 3 February. Mattarella's first statement as new president was thusly: \"My thoughts go first and especially to the difficulties and hopes of our fellow citizens.\"[58][59][60]\n\n\nMattarella's first presidential visit was on the day of his election, when he visited the Fosse Ardeatine, where during World War II in 1944 the German Nazi occupation troops killed 335 people as a reprisal for an Italian resistance movement attack. Mattarella stated that \"Europe and the world must be united to defeat whoever wants to drag us into a new age of terror\".[61]\n\n\nOn 16 February 2015, Mattarella appointed Ugo Zampetti as Secretary-General to the Presidency of the Republic, the head of the presidential secretariat.[62] While three days before, on 13 February, the President appointed Giovanni Grasso as his special counselor for press and communication.[63] As of 2023, Zampetti, a civil servant with a long-time experience within Italian politics, and Grasso, a journalist and writer, are still holding their posts.[64]\n\n\nOn 6 May, he signed the new Italian electoral law, known as *Italicum*, which provides for a two-round system based on party-list proportional representation, corrected by a majority bonus and a 3% election threshold. Candidates run for election in 100 multi-member constituencies with open lists, except for a single candidate chosen by each party who is the first to be elected.[65]\n\n\n\n#### 2016 political crisis[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2016 Italian constitutional referendum\n\n![](image)President Mattarella and Prime Minister Matteo Renzi in 2015\nOn 4 December 2016, a constitutional referendum was held in Italy.[66][67] Voters were asked whether they approve a constitutional law that amends the Constitution of Italy to reform the composition and powers of the Parliament of Italy, as well as the division of powers between the state, the regions, and administrative entities.[68][69] The bill, put forward by then-Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, and his centre-left Democratic Party, was first introduced by the government in the Senate on 8 April 2014. After several amendments were made to the proposed law by both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, the bill received its first approval on 13 October 2015 (Senate) and 11 January 2016 (Chamber of Deputies), and its second and final approval on 20 January (Senate) and 12 April (Chamber of Deputies).[70]\n\n\nIn accordance with Article 138 of the Constitution of Italy, a referendum was called after the formal request of more than one-fifth of the members of both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies,[71] since the constitutional law had not been approved by a qualified majority of two-thirds in each house of parliament in the second vote.[72] 59.11% of voters voted against the constitutional reform, meaning it did not come into effect.[73] This was the third constitutional referendum in the history of the Italian Republic; the other two were in 2001, in which the amending law was approved, and in 2006, in which it was rejected.[74]\n\n\nFollowing the defeat, Prime Minister Renzi resigned. On 11 December, Mattarella appointed the incumbent Minister of Foreign Affairs Paolo Gentiloni as new head of the government.[75] Gentiloni led a government composed by PD, NCD, and other minor centrist parties, the same majority of Renzi's.[76] According to many political analysts and commentators, the appointment of Gentiloni caused tensions between Mattarella and Renzi, who asked the president to dissolve the parliament and call for a snap election in 2017.[77] This version was later confirmed by Renzi during a press conference following the 2018 general election, in which he stated it was an error not to vote in 2017.[78]\n\n\n\n#### 2018 general election and government formation[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2018 Italian general election and 2018 Italian government formation\n\nThe March 2018 election resulted in a hung parliament, with no coalitions able to form a majority of seats in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. The election was seen as a backlash against the Establishment with the Five Star Movement (M5S) and the League becoming the two largest parties in the Parliament.[79][80]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mattarella with Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni on 24 March 2018\nAfter the election's results were known, Luigi Di Maio, leader of the M5S, and Matteo Salvini, secretary of the League, each urged that Mattarella should give him the task of forming a new cabinet because he led the largest party or coalition, respectively.[81] On 5 March, Matteo Renzi declared the PD to be in the opposition during this legislature and resigned as party leader when a new cabinet was formed.[82] On 6 March, Salvini repeated his campaign message that his party would refuse any coalition with the M5S.[83] On 14 March, Salvini offered to govern with the M5S, imposing the condition that League ally Forza Italia (FI), led by former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, must also take part in any coalition. Di Maio rejected this proposal on the grounds that Salvini was \"choosing restoration instead of revolution\" because \"Berlusconi represents the past\".[84] Moreover, Alessandro Di Battista, a prominent M5S leader, denied any possibility of an alliance with FI, describing Berlusconi as the \"pure evil of our country\".[85]\n\n\nThe consultations between Mattarella and the major political parties in Italy on 4 and 5 April failed to result in a candidate for the prime minister, forcing Mattarella to hold another round of consultation between 11 and 12 April.[86]\n\n\nOn 18 April, Mattarella tasked the President of the Senate Elisabetta Casellati with trying to reconcile the issues between the centre-right coalition and the M5S in order to break the post-election political deadlock and form a fully functional new government;[87][88] however, she failed to find a solution to the conflicts between the two groups, especially between FI and the M5S.[89][90] On 23 April, after Casellati's failure, Mattarella gave an exploratory mandate to the President of the Chamber of Deputies Roberto Fico to try to create a political agreement between the Democratic Party (PD) and the M5S.[91][92][93] On 30 April, following an interview of Renzi, the PD's former leader, in which he expressed his strong opposition to an alliance with the M5S, Di Maio called for new elections.[94][95][96]\n\n\n\n![](image)President Mattarella receiving Carlo Cottarelli in May 2018\nOn 7 May, Mattarella held a third round of government formation talks, after which he formally confirmed the lack of any possible majority (the M5S rejecting an alliance with the centre-right coalition, the PD rejecting an alliance with both M5S and the centre-right coalition, and the League's Salvini refusing to form a government with M5S unless it included Berlusconi's FI, whose presence in the government was explicitly vetoed by the M5S's leader Di Maio); as a result, he stated his intention to soon appoint a \"neutral government\" (ignoring the M5S and the League's refusal to support such an option) to take over from the Gentiloni Cabinet, which was considered unable to lead Italy into a second consecutive election, as it represented a majority from a past legislature, and suggested an early election in July, which would be the first summer general election in Italy, as an option in light of the ongoing deadlock.[97] The League and the M5S agreed to hold new elections on 8 July, an option that was rejected by all other parties.[98][99][100]\n\n\nOn 9 May, after a day of rumours, the M5S and the League officially asked Mattarella to give them 24 more hours to strike a coalition agreement between the two parties.[101] Later that same day, Berlusconi stated that FI would not support an M5S–League government on a vote of confidence but would maintain the centre-right alliance, opening the door to a possible majority government between the two parties.[102] On 13 May, the M5S and League reached an agreement in principle on a government program, clearing the way for the formation of a governing coalition between the two parties, but could not agree regarding the members of a government cabinet, most importantly the prime minister. The M5S and League leaders met with Mattarella on 14 May to guide the formation of a new government.[103] At their meeting with Mattarella, both parties asked for an additional week of negotiations to agree on a detailed government program, as well as a prime minister to lead the joint government.[104][105] Both the M5S and the League asked their respective members to vote on the government agreement by the weekend.[106]\n\n\nOn 21 May, a private law professor, Giuseppe Conte, was proposed by Di Maio and Salvini for the role of Prime Minister of Italy.[107][108][109] Despite reports in the Italian press suggesting that Mattarella still had significant reservations about the direction of the new government,[110] Conte was invited to the Quirinal Palace on 23 May to receive the presidential mandate to form a new cabinet.[111][112] In the traditional statement after the appointment, Conte said that he would be the \"defense lawyer of Italian people\".[113]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mattarella with Giuseppe Conte at the Quirinal Palace\nOn 27 May, Conte renounced his mandate due to conflicts between Salvini and Mattarella. Salvini had proposed university professor Paolo Savona as Italian Minister of Economy and Finances, but Mattarella strongly opposed the appointment, considering Savona too Eurosceptic and anti-German.[114] In his speech after Conte's resignation, Mattarella declared that the two parties wanted to bring Italy out of the eurozone and that, as the guarantor of the Italian constitution and the country's interest and stability, he could not allow this. Mattarella subsequently gave economist Carlo Cottarelli the presidential mandate to form a new government.[115][116][117]\n\n\nMattarella's decision prompted furious reactions from the M5S, who called for Mattarella's impeachment, a move also supported by opposition party Brothers of Italy.[118] The League did not support this action.[119] Calls for impeachment were strongly criticized by Italian and international press. Luciano Fontana (editor of *Corriere della Sera*) defended Mattarella and said that \"Di Maio and Salvini are responsible for this crisis\", while Mario Calabresi (editor of *la Repubblica*) dismissed impeachment proposals as \"delirious\", and *La Stampa* called Di Maio and Meloni's proposal \"extremely irresponsible\".[120] *HuffPost* editor Lucia Annunziata dismissed Di Maio and Salvini as \"liars\",[121] while news magazine *L'Espresso* called them \"subversive\", and *Le Monde* praised Mattarella as an \"intransigent guardian of the Constitution\".[122] The president was also defended by *The Guardian*, *Libération*, and *Der Spiegel*.[123] German business newspaper *Handelsblatt* titled \"Forza Mattarella!\" (\"Go Mattarella!\")[124] Marco Travaglio and Maurizio Belpietro (editors of *Il Fatto Quotidiano* and *La Verità*) criticized Mattarella's move as an abuse but recognized that it was not sufficient to start an impeachment procedure.[125][126] After a few days, the M5S and the League agreed not to propose Savona as finance minister; on 31 May, Conte received again the presidential mandate to form the new cabinet.[127] The new government was sworn in on 1 June.[128]\n\n\n\n#### Political crises of 2019 and 2021[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2019 Italian government crisis and 2021 Italian government crisis\n\n![](image)President Mattarella during the August 2019 consultations\nIn August 2019, Deputy Prime Minister Salvini launched a motion of no confidence against Conte, after growing tensions within the majority.[129] Many political analysts believe the no-confidence motion was an attempt to force early elections to improve Lega's standing in the Italian Parliament, ensuring that Salvini would become the next prime minister.[130] On 20 August, following the parliamentary debate in which Conte accused Salvini of being a political opportunist who \"had triggered the political crisis only to serve his personal interest\",[131] the prime minister resigned his post to President Mattarella.[132] On the following day, Mattarella started the consultations with parliamentary groups.[133]\n\n\nDuring the round of consultations between Mattarella and the parliamentary groups, a possible new majority emerged, between the M5S and the Democratic Party (PD).[134] On 28 August, the PD's leader Nicola Zingaretti favored keeping Conte at the head of the new government.[135] On the following day, Mattarella received Conte to give him the task of forming a new cabinet.[136] On 4 September, Conte introduced his new cabinet, which was sworn in at the Quirinal Palace on the following day.[137] On 9 September 2019, the Chamber of Deputies expressed its confidence in the government with 343 votes in favour, 263 against, and 3 abstentions.[138][139] On 10 September 2019, in the second vote of confidence in the Senate, 169 lawmakers voted in favour of the new government and 133 voted against.[140]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mattarella and Mario Draghi at the Quirinal Palace in February 2021\nIn January 2021, Matteo Renzi, former prime minister and leader of Italia Viva (IV), who split from the PD in 2019, revoked his party's support to the government of Conte, who did not resign immediately.[141] On 18 and 19 January, Renzi's party abstained and the government won the key confidence votes in the Chamber and in the Senate but failed in reaching an absolute majority in the Senate.[142] On 26 January, Prime Minister Conte resigned from his office, prompting President Mattarella to start consultations for the formation of a new government.[143]\n\n\nIn February, when the consultations for the formation of a Conte's third government failed, Mattarella gave Mario Draghi, former president of the European Central Bank, the task of forming a government of national unity.[144][145][146] On 3 February, Draghi accepted with reservation the task of forming a new cabinet and started the consultations with the presidents of the two houses.[147]\n\n\nAfter successful negotiations with parties including FI, the League, the M5S, and the PD, Draghi was sworn in as the prime minister on 13 February,[148] pledging to oversee effective implementation of COVID-19 economic stimulus.[149] Draghi's government has been described as both a national unity government[150] and \"president's government\", a cabinet sponsored by and implemented by Mattarella.[151]\n\n\n\n#### COVID-19 pandemic[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: COVID-19 pandemic in Italy and COVID-19 lockdowns in Italy\n\nDuring Mattarella's presidency, Italy was hit by a major outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. In February 2020, Italy became one of the countries with the highest number of confirmed cases of COVID-19.[152] As of September 2023[update], there have been more than 25 million COVID-19 cases confirmed and more than 190,000 deaths; the pandemic mainly started in Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, Piedmont, and Veneto[153] but then spread through the whole country.[154][155]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mattarella wearing a protective mask at the Victor Emmanuel II Monument during the Liberation Day in April 2020\nOn 22 February, the Council of Ministers introduced a bill to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, quarantining more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in Northern Italy. After few days, schools and universities closed in the whole country.[156] On 8 March, the Italian government extended the quarantine to the entire region of Lombardy and 14 other northern provinces, putting more than a quarter of the national population under pandemic lockdown.[157] On the following day, the government extended the quarantine measures previously applied only in the so-called \"red zones\" to the whole country, putting *de facto* 60 million people in lockdown.[158][159] At the time of its application,[160] this measure was described as the largest lockdown in human history.[161][162][163]\nOn 18 May, the lockdown officially ended and the government allowed the re-openings of bars, restaurants, barbers and gyms.[164] The possibility to travel between different regions was restored on 3 June.[165]\n\n\nStarting from July, many countries in Europe, including Italy, witnessed a new rise in detected COVID-19 cases.[166][167] On 7 October, the parliament postponed the end of the state of emergency to 31 January 2021, and Prime Minister Conte imposed the use of protection mask outdoors.[168] On 13 October 2020, the Italian government reintroduced stricter rules to limit the spread of COVID-19.[169] Demonstrations and gatherings of people were strictly forbidden.[170] Regions and municipalities were given the power to only tighten but not release containment measures.[171] On 25 October, the government introduced new restrictions, imposing the closing of gyms, swimming pools, theatres, and cinemas, as well as the closing of bars and restaurants by 6 pm.[172] Restrictions were later confirmed until April 2021 by the new government led by Mario Draghi.[173]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mattarella on 31 December 2021 during the last speech of his first term as president\nOn 15 March 2021, Prime Minister Draghi placed the majority of Italy under so-called \"full lockdown\" conditions, with non-essential businesses closing and travel restricted, in response to an increase in the transmission of COVID-19; unlike the 2020 lockdown, factories and some other workplaces were allowed to remain open. Draghi vowed that Italy would see its vaccination programme triple in April, reaching 500,000 people per day by that time.[174]\n\n\nIn June 2021, the more contagious SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant became predominant in Italy.[175][176][177] In August 2021, the government extended the requirement of the EU Digital COVID Certificate, also known as Green Pass, to the participation in sports events and music festivals but also to the access to indoor places like bars, restaurants and gyms, as well as to long-distance public transportation, in an attempt to contain the spread of new variants.[178] On 15 October, Italy became the first country in the world to establish a mandatory COVID-19 vaccination certificate for the entire work force, public, and private.[179]\n\n\nOn 31 December, during what was anticipated to be his last speech to the nation as president and within a dramatic increasing in COVID-19 cases, Mattarella thanked all the Italians who got vaccinated, stressing that \"wasting vaccines was an offense to anyone who didn't have them\".[180] Mattarella also stated that during his seven-year term he never felt alone, thanking Italians to have shown \"the best face of the country\".[181]\n\n\n\n### Second term (2022–present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)President Mattarella and Prime Minister Mario Draghi at the Victor Emmanuel II Monument on the inauguration day\nDuring 2021, despite high popularity amid the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy,[182][183][184] President Mattarella refused to run for a second term despite various political forces asking him to do so, recalling similar remarks made by his predecessors Antonio Segni and Giovanni Leone.[185][186] Despite his firm denial, Mattarella received several votes in the ballots, notably reaching 336 votes in the sixth ballot and 387 in the seventh one, even if no major party or coalition formally supported him as a candidate.[187] On the morning of 29 January, after all other possible candidacies failed and the two major coalitions could not agree on a shared candidate, the re-election of incumbent president Mattarella became a serious alternative.[188][189] On the same day, Mattarella agreed to serve a second term,[190] and was re-elected with 759 votes,[191] as most party leaders and Prime Minister Mario Draghi asked him to accept their joint nomination for another term.[192][193][194]\n\n\nOn 3 February, President Mattarella was sworn in for his second term in front of a joint assembly of the parliament. He called for unity, saying: \"We still need to work together to strengthen Italy, beyond the current difficulties.\" He also commented on the Russo-Ukrainian crisis, stating: \"We cannot accept that now, without even the pretext of competition between different political and economic systems, the winds of confrontation are once again blowing across a continent that has experienced the tragedies of the First and Second World Wars.\"[195] Mattarella added: \"We must appeal to our resources and those of allied and friendly countries so that the displays of strength give way to mutual understanding so that no people should fear aggression from their neighbours.\"[196] Following the invasion of the country, Mattarella strongly condemned Vladimir Putin's decision to attack Ukraine, describing the invasion as a \"brutal war\"[197] and a \"nineteenth-century-like attack that evoked frightening scenarios, with humanity as the protagonist of its own ruin\".[198]\n\n\n\n#### 2022 government crisis[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 Italian government crisis\n\n![](image)Mattarella dissolving the Parliament following Draghi's resignation\nOn 13 July 2022, M5S abstained during the confidence vote on the *decreto aiuti* (English: aid decree), a bill that introduced stimulus to contrast the ongoing energy crisis.[199][200] On the following day, the M5S left the Senate floor during the voting process, *de facto* opening a government crisis within the Draghi's cabinet.[201] Following the M5S's abstention, Prime Minister Draghi consulted with President Mattarella about the crisis and, after a few hours, he formally resigned as Prime Minister citing a lack of political trust and confidence within the government's majority.[202] However, Mattarella rejected the resignation because the government had largely won the confidence vote in the Senate and invited the prime minister to address the Parliament, explaining the political situation.[203][204]\n\n\nOn 20 July, the government failed to reach the absolute majority in the confidence vote as Lega, FI and M5S decided not to take part in the ballot, *de facto* causing the fall of the government.[205][206][207] On the following day, after a speech in front of the Chamber of Deputies, Draghi officially resigned as prime minister.[208] Mattarella accepted his resignation, but Draghi remained in office as caretaker prime minister until the formation of the Meloni government following a snap general election.[209][210] On the same day, Mattarella summoned Draghi, Roberto Fico and Elisabetta Casellati to the Quirinal Palace and then dissolved the Parliament.[211] In a brief speech to the nation, Mattarella stated: \"Pauses are not possible at the moment we are going through: energy costs have consequences for families and businesses, economic difficulties must be addressed, there are many obligations to be closed in the interest of Italy.\"[212]\n\n\n\n#### 2022 general election and government formation[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2022 Italian general election and 2022 Italian government formation\n\n![](image)Mattarella with Giorgia Meloni during a military parade in 2023\nThe 2022 general election, held on 25 September, was characterized by a strong showing of the centre-right coalition led by Giorgia Meloni's Brothers of Italy (FdI), which won an absolute majority of seats in the Italian Parliament.[213] On 20 October, a few days after the elections of the presidents of the two houses of Parliament, Ignazio La Russa of FdI on 13 October for the Senate of the Republic, and Lorenzo Fontana of the League on 14 October for the Chamber of Deputies,[214][215] Mattarella officially launched consultations on the formation of a new cabinet.[216]\n\n\nOn the following day, the centre-right coalition formally proposed Meloni as its candidate to the premiership. In the afternoon, Mattarella summoned Meloni to the Quirinal Palace and gave her the task of forming a new cabinet. The Cabinet was announced on 21 October and was officially sworn in on 22 October.[217][218] It was one of the fastest government formations in the history of the Italian Republic.[219] Meloni became the first woman to serve as Prime Minister of Italy.[220][221]\n\n\nIn February 2023, Mattarella officially asked the government to modify the law regarding beach concessions in Italy, which was considered against both the European law and the opinion of the Italian Council of State.[222] He also criticised the so-called *Milleproroghe* (English: Thousand extensions), a decree law promoted by the government aimed at resolving urgent provisions by the end of the current year and described by Mattarella as a \"mere container of the most different regulatory interventions\".[223]\n\n\n\n## Personal life and public image[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mattarella celebrating during the UEFA Euro 2020 final\nMattarella married Marisa Chiazzese, daughter of Lauro Chiazzese, a professor of Roman law and rector of the University of Palermo, in 1966; his brother Piersanti was married to Marisa's sister Irma. Mattarella and his wife have three children:[224][225] Laura (born 1967), Bernardo Giorgio (1968),[226] and Francesco (1973). Marisa Chiazzese died from a tumor in 2012.[224] Their daughter Laura has acted as *de facto* First Lady,[227] accompanying her father on official trips outside Italy.[228][229] Mattarella is a Roman Catholic.\n\n\nBest known for its involvement in politics, Mattarella's family has held various national and regional offices spanning across two generations. His father Bernardo was a member of the Constituent Assembly and served as minister in various governments from 1953 until 1963. His brother Piersanti was murdered in 1980 in Sicily by *Cosa Nostra* while serving as president of the Regional Government of Sicily.[230] Another brother, Antonio, was managing director of the Investment Banking division of Goldman Sachs from 2005 to 2017.[231][232]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mattarella taking a selfie with Gianni Morandi, Chiara Ferragni, Amadeus and his daughter Laura, before Sanremo Music Festival 2023\nMattarella is an association football fan and a supporter of Inter Milan.[233] As head of state, he attended the UEFA Euro 2020, which included Italy as one of the hosts, and the UEFA Euro 2020 Final at Wembley Stadium on 11 July 2021, which was won by Italy, beating England on penalty kicks following a 1–1 draw after extra time.[234] On the following day, he hosted the national team at the Quirinal Palace to celebrate.[235]\n\n\nAt the end of his first term, Mattarella's approval rating was among the highest ever for an Italian president and the highest among Western world leaders.[236] According to the polling firm Ixè, Mattarella's approval rating in December 2021 was at 77%,[237] while it stood at 66% according to SWG[238] and 65% according to Quorum–YouTrend.[239] In February 2023, one year after his re-election as president, his approval rating was still very high, remaining at 77% according to Ixè and 65% for Quorum–YouTrend.[240][241]\n\n\nOn 7 February 2023, Mattarella became the first president to attend the Sanremo Music Festival.[242]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Election\n | House\n |

He served as the 22nd Prime Minister of Luxembourg from 2013 to 2023. He was a member of the Chamber of Deputies (1999–2013) and Mayor of Luxembourg City (2011–2013).[1][2]\n\n\nBettel is a member of the Democratic Party (DP).[3] Following the 2013 general election, he took office as Prime Minister and succeeded Jean-Claude Juncker of the Christian Social People's Party (CSV). Bettel became the first openly gay prime minister in the world to serve a second term in 2018, when his mandate was renewed. He was appointed Deputy Prime Minister in 2023 in the Frieden-Bettel Government.[4][5]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nBettel was born on 3 March 1973 in Luxembourg City. His father, Claude Bettel, was a wine merchant.[6] Bettel said he has an Orthodox Russian grandfather and a Polish-Jewish grandfather, while his parents were Catholics.[7] His mother Aniela is a grandniece of the Russian composer Sergei Rachmaninoff.[8] After completing his secondary school studies at Lycée Hélène Boucher in Thionville,[9] Bettel obtained a master's degree in Public and European Law and a DEA in Political Science and Public Law from Nancy 2 University in Nancy, France.[10][11] He also studied maritime law as well as canon law at Aristotle University in Thessaloniki, Greece, where he was studying thanks to the Erasmus Programme.[12] For four years in the early 2000s he hosted *Sonndes em 8*, a weekly talkshow, on the now-defunct private T.TV television network.[13][14] In 2017, he also received an Honorary doctorate from Sacred Heart University Luxembourg.[15][16]\n\n\n\n## Political career[edit]\n\n\n### Municipal politics[edit]\n\n\nIn the elections of 1999, Bettel was elected to Luxembourg City's communal council, finishing sixth on the DP's list. Two years after his election to the local council, on 12 July 2001, he was certified as a lawyer.[2] On 28 November 2005, after the municipal elections in which he was placed fourth on the DP list, Bettel was appointed *échevin* (alderman) in the council of Luxembourg City.[2]\n\n\nFollowing municipal elections on 9 October 2011, Bettel was sworn in as Mayor of Luxembourg on 24 November 2011. He resigned from his position as DP leader in the Chamber of Deputies, which he had held since 2009.[17][18]\n\n\n\n### National politics[edit]\n\n\nBettel ran for the Chamber of Deputies in the 1999 general election; he finished tenth amongst DP candidates in the Centre constituency, with the top seven being elected.[19] However, the DP overtook the Luxembourg Socialist Workers' Party (LSAP) as the second-largest party; its members formed the majority of the new government as the Christian Social People's Party's (CSV) coalition partners. Thus, with Lydie Polfer and Anne Brasseur vacating their seats to take roles in the government, as well as Colette Flesch not taking her seat so as to focus on her role as Member of the European Parliament (MEP), Bettel was appointed to the Chamber of Deputies, starting 12 August 1999.[2]\n\n\nBy the time of the 2004 general election, Bettel had significantly consolidated his position; he finished fourth (of the five DP members elected), assuring him a seat in the Chamber of Deputies.[20]\n\n\n\n### Prime Minister[edit]\n\n\n#### First term[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Xavier Bettel with Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov in Sofia on 16 May 2018\nIn 2013, Bettel was elected leader of the Democratic Party. In the 2013 general election, he led the party to a third-ranked position in parliamentary seats. On 25 October, Bettel was designated by Grand Duke Henri as the formateur for the next government.[21] He assumed his post as Luxembourg's Prime Minister on 4 December 2013. In the government's coalition of the Democratic Party (DP), Luxembourg Socialist Workers' Party (LSAP) and The Greens, he led the cabinet with co-Deputy Prime Ministers Etienne Schneider and Félix Braz. In his first term, he also held the functions of Minister of State, Minister for Communications and the Media, Minister for Culture and Minister for Religious Affairs.[2]\n\n\n\n#### Second term[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bettel and US Ambassador Randy Evans at the Luxembourg American Cemetery and Memorial, for the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge, on 16 December 2019\n![](image)Xavier Bettel with Slovenian Prime Minister Robert Golob in Ljubljana on 22 February 2023\nFollowing the 2018 election, he became the first openly gay prime minister in the world to be reelected for a second term. He began his second term when his government was formed on 5 December 2018,[22] which he currently leads with co-Deputy Prime Ministers François Bausch and Dan Kersch. The government is a continuation between the Democratic Party, the Luxembourg Socialist Workers' Party and The Greens from the Bettel I government, with minor changes.\n\n\nOn 16 September 2019, following a short bilateral meeting on the status of Brexit negotiations, Bettel continued a press conference without British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, after Johnson abruptly pulled out due to an anti-Brexit protest held by British citizens living in Luxembourg.[23] Bettel gestured towards Johnson's empty podium and confirmed that the UK Government had not tabled any concrete proposals for amendments to the UK's Withdrawal Agreement, particularly the \"Irish backstop\" that Johnson wished to replace.[24] This being despite the public pronouncements of Prime Minister Johnson and the UK's departure date from the EU fast approaching.[24] Pro-Brexit UK media reported the matter as an ambush,[25] whilst other UK and international media outlets largely saw the incident, as well as the reaction of pro-Brexit UK media outlets to it, as confirming the increasing hypersensitivity of pro-Brexit pundits and politicians to criticism.[23][24][26][27][28][29]\n\n\nOn 29 February 2020, all of Luxembourg's public transport became free of charge as a result of the Bettel II government coalition agreement.[30]\n\n\n\n### Deputy Prime Minister[edit]\n\n\nBettel was appointed Deputy Prime Minister in the Frieden-Bettel Government, after the coalition lost the 2023 election and only gained 29 seats. A new coalition government emerged between the CSV and DP, in which Luc Frieden is the Prime Minister.\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nBettel, who is openly gay,[31] has stated that increasingly in Luxembourg \"people do not consider the fact of whether someone is gay or not\". Bettel was Luxembourg's first openly gay Prime Minister. Worldwide, he was the third openly gay head of government following Iceland's Prime Minister Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir (2009–2013) and Belgium's Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo (2011–2014).[32] He was one of four openly gay world leaders in office, the other being Ana Brnabić, the Prime Minister of Serbia, Leo Varadkar, the Taoiseach of Ireland, and Edgars Rinkēvičs, the President of Latvia.\n\n\nBettel has been married to Gauthier Destenay since 2015,[33] the same year that same-sex marriage was introduced to Luxembourg.[34][35]\n\n\n\n### COVID-19 hospitalisation[edit]\n\n\nOn 4 July 2021, Bettel was admitted to hospital following a COVID-19 diagnosis on 27 June. The move was initially described as precautionary and for tests. It was reported that he experienced \"mild symptoms\" such as high temperature and headache.[36] The following day, it was reported that he was in a \"serious but stable\" condition and would remain hospitalised.[37] On 7 July 2021, the government said that Bettel would remain hospitalised a \"little bit longer\" due to low saturation of oxygen in his blood and that he was recovering \"little by little\".[38] On 8 July 2021, Bettel was discharged from hospital. It was announced he would resume activities soon via remote work for the rest of his isolation period. Bettel thanked health authorities for the treatment during his hospitalisation period.[39][40]\n\n\n\n## Honours and awards[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Award or decoration | Country | Date\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Ribbon\n | Name\n |\n| ![](image) | Order of Civil Merit | ![](image) Spain | 2007[*citation needed*] |\n| ![](image) | Order of Orange-Nassau (Knight Grand Officer) | ![](image) Netherlands | 2012[*citation needed*] |\n| ![](image) | Order of the Oak Crown (Knight Grand cross) | ![](image) Luxembourg | 2014[41][42] |\n| ![](image) | Order of the Legion of Honour (Commander) | ![](image) France | 2015[*citation needed*] |\n| ![](image) | Order of the Crown (Knight Grand Cross) | ![](image) Belgium | 2017[43] |\n| ![](image) | Order of Prince Henry (Grand Cross) | ![](image) Portugal | 2017[44] |\n| ![](image) | Order of the Cross of Terra Mariana (Grand Cross) | ![](image) Estonia | 2018[45] |\n| ![](image) | Order of Orange-Nassau (Knight Grand Cross) | ![](image) Netherlands | 2018[*citation needed*] |\n| ![](image) | Order of the Republic of Serbia[46] (Grand Cross with Collar, Serbia's highest award) | ![](image) Serbia | 2020\n |\n| ![GRE Order of Honour Grand Cross BAR](image) | Order of Honour (Grand Cross)\n | ![](image) Greece | 2023[47] |\n\n\n## Allegations of plagiarism[edit]\n\n\n\"In his thesis at the University of Nancy there is not one correct reference,\" wrote Pol Reuter with reference to research by Reporter.lu. The master's thesis, submitted in 1999, is dedicated to the topic of electoral reform at the European Parliament. Allegedly, only two of the total 56 pages were free of plagiarism. The plagiarism findings are said to have been confirmed by several independent researchers.[48] Bettel stated he wrote this thesis with a clear conscience, although \"from today’s standpoint, it could have – yes, maybe should have – been done differently.\" He also stated he would accept the findings of the University of Lorraine on the matter.[49]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Bettel I (2013–2018)\n* Bettel II (2018–2023)\n* List of openly LGBT heads of government\n* List of the first LGBT holders of political offices\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Xavier Bettel\".

He became Prince of Orange as heir apparent upon his mother's accession as Queen on 30 April 1980, and succeeded her following her abdication on 30 April 2013. He went to public primary and secondary schools in the Netherlands, an international sixth-form college in Wales, served in the Royal Netherlands Navy, and studied history at Leiden University. He married Máxima Zorreguieta Cerruti in 2002 and they have three daughters: Catharina-Amalia, Princess of Orange (born 2003), Princess Alexia (born 2005), and Princess Ariane (born 2007).\n\n\nWillem-Alexander is interested in sports and international water management issues. Until his accession to the throne, he was a member of the International Olympic Committee (1998–2013),[1] chairman of the Advisory Committee on Water to the Dutch Minister of Infrastructure and the Environment (2004–2013),[2] and chairman of the Secretary-General of the United Nations' Advisory Board on Water and Sanitation (2006–2013).[3][4]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Prince Willem-Alexander (left) at age 14 and his brother Friso in 1982\nWillem-Alexander Claus George Ferdinand was born on 27 April 1967 at the Utrecht University Hospital (now known as the University Medical Center Utrecht) in Utrecht, Netherlands. He is the first child of Princess Beatrix and Prince Claus,[5] and the first grandchild of Queen Juliana and Prince Bernhard. He was the first male Dutch royal baby since the birth of Prince Alexander in 1851, and the first immediate male heir since Alexander's death in 1884.\n\n\nFrom birth, Willem-Alexander has held the titles Prince of the Netherlands (Dutch: *Prins der Nederlanden*), Prince of Orange-Nassau (Dutch: *Prins van Oranje-Nassau*), and Jonkheer of Amsberg (Dutch: *Jonkheer van Amsberg*).[5] He was baptised as a member of the Dutch Reformed Church[6] on 2 September 1967[7] in Saint Jacob's Church in The Hague.[8] His godparents are his maternal grandfather Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld, his paternal grandmother Gösta Freiin von dem Bussche-Haddenhausen, Prince Ferdinand von Bismarck, former Prime Minister Jelle Zijlstra, Jonkvrouw Renée Röell, and Queen Margrethe II of Denmark.[7]\n\n\nHe had two younger brothers: Prince Friso (1968–2013) and Prince Constantijn (born in 1969). He lived with his family at the castle Drakensteyn in the hamlet Lage Vuursche near Baarn from his birth until 1981, when they moved to the larger palace Huis ten Bosch in The Hague. His mother, Beatrix, became Queen of the Netherlands in 1980, after his grandmother Juliana abdicated. He then received the title of Prince of Orange as heir apparent to the throne of the Kingdom of the Netherlands at the age of 13.[5]\n\n\nWillem-Alexander attended local state primary school Nieuwe Baarnse Elementary School in Baarn from 1973 to 1979. He went to two different state secondary schools: the Baarns Lyceum in Baarn from 1979 to 1981 and the Eerste Vrijzinnig Christelijk Lyceum in The Hague from 1981 to 1983, and the private sixth-form college United World College of the Atlantic in Wales, the UK (1983 to 1985), from which he received his International Baccalaureate.[5][9]\n\n\nAfter his military service from 1985 to 1987, Willem-Alexander studied History at Leiden University from 1987 onwards and received his MA degree (*doctorandus*) in 1993.[10][11] His final thesis was on the Dutch response to France's decision under President Charles de Gaulle to leave NATO's integrated command structure.[5]\n\n\nWillem-Alexander speaks English, Spanish, French and German (his father's native language, despite never getting German language lessons from him) fluently in addition to his native Dutch.[12]\n\n\n\n## Military training and career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Willem-Alexander in the navy uniform of ensign in 1986\nBetween secondary school and his university education, Willem-Alexander performed military service in the Royal Netherlands Navy from August 1985 until January 1987. He received his training at the Royal Netherlands Naval College and the frigates HNLMS *Tromp* and HNLMS *Abraham Crijnssen*, where he was an ensign. In 1988 he received additional training at the ship HNLMS *Van Kinsbergen* and became a lieutenant (junior grade) (*wachtofficier*).[13]\n\n\nAs a reservist for the Royal Netherlands Navy, Willem-Alexander was promoted to lieutenant commander in 1995, commander in 1997, Captain at Sea in 2001, and commodore in 2005. As a reservist for the Royal Netherlands Army, he was made a major (Grenadiers' and Rifles Guard Regiment) in 1995, and was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1997, colonel in 2001, and brigadier general in 2005. As a reservist for the Royal Netherlands Air Force, he was made squadron leader in 1995 and promoted to air commodore in 2005. As a reservist for the Royal Marechaussee, he was made brigadier general in 2005.[9]\n\n\nBefore his investiture as king in 2013, Willem-Alexander was honourably discharged from the armed forces. The government declared that the head of state cannot be a serving member of the armed forces, since the government itself holds supreme command over the armed forces. As king, Willem-Alexander may choose to wear a military uniform with royal insignia, but not with his former rank insignia.[14]\n\n\n\n## Activities and social interests[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Prince Willem-Alexander and Princess Máxima meet Michelle Obama, Barack Obama and Fay Hartog-Levin at the White House in 2009.\nSince 1985, when he became 18 years old, Willem-Alexander has been a member of the Council of State of the Netherlands. This is the highest council of the Dutch political system and is chaired by the head of state (then Queen Beatrix).[15]\n\n\nWillem-Alexander is interested in water management and sports issues. He was an honorary member of the World Commission on Water for the 21st century and patron of the Global Water Partnership, a body established by the World Bank, the UN, and the Swedish Ministry of Development. He was appointed as the Chairperson of the United Nations Secretary General's Advisory Board on Water and Sanitation on 12 December 2006.[16]\n\n\nOn 10 October 2010, Willem-Alexander and Máxima went to the Netherlands Antilles' capital, Willemstad, to attend and represent his mother, the Queen, at the Antillean Dissolution ceremony.\n\n\nHe was a patron of the Dutch Olympic Games Committee until 1998 when he was made a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). After becoming King, he relinquished his membership and received the Gold Olympic Order at the 125th IOC Session.[17] To celebrate the 100th anniversary of the 1928 Summer Olympics held in Amsterdam, he had expressed support to bid for the 2028 Summer Olympics.[18]\n\n\nHe was a member of the supervisory board of De Nederlandsche Bank (the Dutch central bank), a member of the Advisory Council of ECP (the information society forum for government, business and civil society), patron of Veterans' Day and held several other patronages and posts.[19]\n\n\n\n## Reign[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Inauguration of Willem-Alexander\n\nOn 28 January 2013, Beatrix announced her intention of abdicating. On the morning of 30 April 2013, Beatrix signed the instrument of abdication at the *Moseszaal* (Moses Hall) at the Royal Palace of Amsterdam. Later that afternoon, Willem-Alexander was inaugurated as king in front of the joint assembly of the States General in a ceremony held at the Nieuwe Kerk.\n\n\nAs king, Willem-Alexander has weekly meetings with the prime minister and speaks regularly with ministers and state secretaries. He also signs all new Acts of Parliament and royal decrees. He represents the kingdom at home and abroad. At the State Opening of Parliament, he delivers the Speech from the Throne, which announces the plans of the government for the parliamentary year. The Constitution requires that the king appoint, dismiss and swear in all government ministers and state secretaries. As king, he is also the President of the Council of State, an advisory body that reviews proposed legislation. In modern practice, the monarch seldom chairs council meetings.[20]\n\n\nAt his accession at age 46, he was Europe's youngest monarch. On the inauguration of Spain's Felipe VI on 19 June 2014, he became, and remains, Europe's second-youngest monarch. He is also the first male monarch of the Netherlands since the death of his great-great-grandfather William III in 1890. Willem-Alexander was one of four new monarchs to take the throne in 2013 along with Pope Francis, the Emir Tamim bin Hamad of Qatar, and King Philippe of Belgium.\n\n\n\n## Other activities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Willem-Alexander with his family at the 2012 Summer Olympics, here supporting Ellen van Dijk\nWillem-Alexander is an avid pilot and has said that if he had not been a royal, he would have liked to be an airline pilot so he could fly internationally on large-sized aircraft such as the Boeing 747.[21] During the reign of his mother, he regularly flew the Dutch royal aircraft on trips.[22] However, in May 2017, Willem-Alexander revealed that he had served as a first officer on KLM flights for 21 years, flying KLM Cityhopper's Fokker 70s twice a month, even after his accession to the throne. Following KLM's phased retirement of the Fokker 70, he began training to fly Boeing 737s. Willem-Alexander was rarely recognized while in the KLM uniform and wearing the KLM cap, though a few passengers recognized his voice, even though he never gave his name and only welcomed passengers on behalf of the captain and crew.[21][23]\n\n\nUsing the name \"W. A. van Buren\", one of the least-known titles of the House of Orange-Nassau, he participated in the 1986 Frisian Elfstedentocht, a 200-kilometre-long (120 mi) distance ice skating tour.[24] He ran the New York City Marathon under the same pseudonym in 1992.[25] Willem-Alexander completed both events.\n\n\n\n## Marriage and children[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wedding of Willem-Alexander, Prince of Orange, and Máxima Zorreguieta Cerruti\n\n![](image)Prince Willem-Alexander and Princess Máxima kiss at the balcony of the Royal Palace of Amsterdam on their wedding day in 2002.\nOn 2 February 2002, he married Máxima Zorreguieta Cerruti at the Nieuwe Kerk in Amsterdam. The marriage triggered significant controversy due to the role the bride's father, Jorge Zorreguieta, had in the Argentinian military dictatorship. The couple have three daughters: The Princess of Orange, Princess Alexia, and Princess Ariane.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n![](image)King Willem-Alexander and Queen Máxima with their daughters Princess Catharina-Amalia (left), Princess Alexia (right) and Princess Ariane (center)\n\n\n| Name | Date of birth | Place of birth | Age\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Catharina-Amalia, Princess of Orange | (2003-12-07)7 December 2003 | The Hague, Netherlands | 20\n |\n| Princess Alexia of the Netherlands | (2005-06-26)26 June 2005 | The Hague, Netherlands | 18\n |\n| Princess Ariane of the Netherlands | (2007-04-10)10 April 2007 | The Hague, Netherlands | 17\n |\n\n\n## Privacy and the press[edit]\n\n\nIn an attempt to strike a balance between privacy for the royal family and availability to the press, the Netherlands Government Information Service (RVD) instituted a media code on 21 June 2005 which essentially states that:[26]\n\n\n\n* Photographs of the members of the royal house while performing their duties are always permitted.\n* For other occasions (like holidays or vacations), the RVD will arrange a photo-op on condition that the press leave the family alone for the rest of the activity.\n\n\nDuring a ski vacation in Argentina, several photographs were taken of the prince and his family during the private part of their holiday, including one by Associated Press staff photographer Natacha Pisarenko, in spite of the media code, and after a photo opportunity had been provided earlier.[27] The Associated Press decided to publish some of the photos, which were subsequently republished by several Dutch media. Willem-Alexander and the RVD jointly filed suit against the Associated Press on 5 August 2009, and the trial started on 14 August 2009 at the district court in Amsterdam. On 28 August 2009, the district court ruled in favour of the prince and RVD, citing that the couple has a right to privacy, that the pictures in question add nothing to any public debate, and that they are not of any particular value to society since they are not photographs of his family \"at work\". Associated Press was sentenced to stop further publication of the photographs, on pain of a €1,000 fine per violation with a €50,000 maximum.[28]\n\n\n\n## Properties[edit]\n\n\nFrom 2003 until 2019, Willem-Alexander and his family lived in Villa Eikenhorst on the De Horsten Estate in Wassenaar.[29] After his mother abdicated and became Princess Beatrix once again, she moved to the castle of Drakensteyn, after which the King and his family moved to the newly renovated monarch's palace of Huis ten Bosch in The Hague in 2019.[30]\n\n\nWillem-Alexander has a villa near Kranidi, Greece.[31]\n\n\n\n### Villa in Machangulo[edit]\n\n\nOn 10 July 2008, the Prince of Orange and Princess Maxima announced that they had invested in a development project on the Mozambican peninsula of Machangulo.[32] The development project was aimed at building an ecologically responsible vacation resort, including a hotel and several luxury holiday homes for investors. The project was to invest heavily in the local economy of the peninsula (building schools and a local clinic) with an eye both towards responsible sustainability and maintaining a local staff.[33] After contacting Mozambican President Armando Guebuza to verify that the Mozambican government had no objections, the couple decided to invest in two villas.[34] In 2009, controversy erupted in parliament and the press about the project and the prince's involvement.[34] Politician Alexander Pechtold questioned the morality of building such a resort in a poor country like Mozambique. After public and parliamentary controversy, the royal couple announced that they had decided to sell the property in Machangulo once their house was completed.[35] In January 2012, it was confirmed that the villa had been sold.[36]\n\n\n\n## Titles, styles, honours and arms[edit]\n\n\n### Titles and styles[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Style of the Dutch sovereign\n\n* 27 April 1967 – 30 April 1980: *His Royal Highness* Prince Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands, Prince of Orange-Nassau, Jonkheer van Amsberg\n* 30 April 1980 – 30 April 2013: *His Royal Highness* The Prince of Orange\n* 30 April 2013 – present: *His Majesty* the King[37]\n\n\nWillem-Alexander's full title is: His Majesty King Willem-Alexander, King of the Netherlands, Prince of Orange-Nassau, etc., etc., etc.[37]\n\n\nWillem-Alexander is the first Dutch king since Willem III (d. 1890).

of Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands\n| ![](image) | Notes\nAs Monarch, Willem-Alexander uses the **Greater Coat of Arms of the Realm** (*Grote Rijkswapen*). The components of the coats of arms were updated and further regulated by Queen Wilhelmina in a royal decree of 10 July 1907 and were affirmed by Queen Juliana in a royal decree of 23 April 1980.\nCrest\nIssuing from a coronet Or, a pair of wings joined Sable each with an arched bend Argent charged with three leaves of the lime-tree stems upward Vert.\nTorse\nAzure and Or\nHelm\nBarred helmet\nEscutcheon\nAzure, billetty Or a lion with a coronet Or armed and langued Gules holding in his dexter paw a sword Argent hilted Or and in the sinister paw seven arrows Argent pointed and bound together Or.\nSupporters\nTwo lions rampant Or armed and langued Gules\nMotto\n* **JE MAINTIENDRAI**\n* *French: I will maintain (in Dutch: *Ik zal handhaven*)*\n\nOther elements\nThe monarch places this coat of arms on a purple mantle, with golden borders and tassels, lined with Ermine. Above the mantle is a purple pavilion again topped with the royal crown.[62] (Note: Although the official blazon states the mantle as purple it often looks like (dark) red. French and German purple contains more red and less blue than American or British purple.)\nBanner\n![](image) Upon his succession to the throne, Willem-Alexander adopted the (partly modified) Royal Standard of the Netherlands, which is a square orange flag, divided in four-quarters by a nassau-blue cross. All quarters show a white and blue bugle-horn, taken from the coat of arms of the Principality of Orange. In the centre of the flag is the (small) coat of arms of the Kingdom, which originates from the arms of the House of Nassau, surmounted by a royal crown and surrounded by the insignia of the Grand Cross of the Military William Order.\nSymbolism\nThe seven arrows stand for the seven provinces of the Union of Utrecht.\nPrevious versions\n![](image) Quarterly, 1 and 3, Azure, billetty Or a lion with a coronet or armed and langued Gules holding in his dexter paw a sword Argent hilted Or and in the sinister paw seven arrows Argent pointed and bound together Or (royal arms of the Netherlands, i.e. that of his mother, Queen Beatrix), 2 and 4, Or, and a bugle-horn Azure, langued Gules (arms of the former Principality of Orange), on an inescutcheon Vert, a castle proper, on a mount of the last (arms of the House of Amsberg, i.e. that of his late father, Prince Claus). |\n\n\n## Ancestry[edit]\n\n\nThrough his father, a member of the House of Amsberg, he is descended from families of the lower German nobility, and through his mother, from several royal German–Dutch families such as the House of Lippe, Mecklenburg-Schwerin, the House of Orange-Nassau, Waldeck and Pyrmont, and the House of Hohenzollern. He is descended from the first king of the Netherlands, William I of the Netherlands, who was also a ruler in Luxembourg and several German states, and all subsequent Dutch monarchs.\n\n\nThrough his mother, Willem-Alexander also descends from Paul I of Russia and thus from German princess Catherine the Great and Swedish King Gustav I. Through his father, he is also descended from several Dutch–Flemish families who left the Low Countries during Spanish rule, such as the Berenbergs. His paternal great-great-grandfather Gabriel von Amsberg, a major-general of Mecklenburg, was recognized as noble as late as 1891, the family having adopted the \"von\" in 1795.[63][64]\n\n\nWillem-Alexander is a descendant of King George II and, more relevant for his succession rights, of his granddaughter Princess Augusta of Great Britain. Under the British Act of Settlement, King Willem-Alexander temporarily forfeited his (distant) succession rights to the throne of the United Kingdom by marrying a Roman Catholic. This right has since been restored in 2015 under the Succession to the Crown Act 2013.[65]\n\n\n\n| Ancestors of Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands |\n| --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 8.

For the CIA-published public domain directory, see World Leaders.\n\n\n\n\nThis is a **list of current heads of state and heads of government**. In some cases, mainly in presidential systems, there is only one leader being both head of state and head of government. In other cases, mainly in semi-presidential and parliamentary systems, the head of state and the head of government are different people. In semi-presidential and parliamentary systems, the head of government role (i.e. executive branch) is fulfilled by both the listed head of government and the head of state. In single-party systems, ruling party's leader (i.e. General Secretary) is usually the *de facto* top leader of the state, though sometimes this leader also holds the presidency or premiership.\n\n\nThe list includes the names of recently elected or appointed heads of state and government who will take office on an appointed date, as presidents-elect and prime ministers-designate, and those leading a government in exile if internationally recognised.\n\n\n\n\n## Member and observer states of the United Nations[edit]\n\n\n* A\n* B\n* C\n* D\n* E\n* F\n* G\n* H\n* I\n* J\n* K\n* L\n* M\n* N\n* O\n* P\n* Q\n* R\n* S\n* T\n* U\n* V\n* Y\n* Z\n\n\n\n| Colour key\n |\n| --- |\n| Green cells indicate leaders whose offices constitutionally administer the executive of their respective state/government.\n |\n| Blue cells indicate *de facto* executive branch leaders whose offices lack *de jure* constitutional power.\n |\n\n\n***Note:** Names in small font generally denote acting, interim, transitional, temporary leaders, or representatives.

In some cases, mainly in presidential systems, there is only one leader being both head of state and head of government. In other cases, mainly in semi-presidential and parliamentary systems, the head of state and the head of government are different people. In semi-presidential and parliamentary systems, the head of government role (i.e. executive branch) is fulfilled by both the listed head of government and the head of state. In single-party systems, ruling party's leader (i.e. General Secretary) is usually the *de facto* top leader of the state, though sometimes this leader also holds the presidency or premiership.\n\n\nThe list includes the names of recently elected or appointed heads of state and government who will take office on an appointed date, as presidents-elect and prime ministers-designate, and those leading a government in exile if internationally recognised.\n\n\n\n\n## Member and observer states of the United Nations[edit]\n\n\n* A\n* B\n* C\n* D\n* E\n* F\n* G\n* H\n* I\n* J\n* K\n* L\n* M\n* N\n* O\n* P\n* Q\n* R\n* S\n* T\n* U\n* V\n* Y\n* Z\n\n\n\n| Colour key\n |\n| --- |\n| Green cells indicate leaders whose offices constitutionally administer the executive of their respective state/government.\n |\n| Blue cells indicate *de facto* executive branch leaders whose offices lack *de jure* constitutional power.\n |\n\n\n***Note:** Names in small font generally denote acting, interim, transitional, temporary leaders, or representatives.

The presidency has been vacant since the assassination of Jovenel Moïse in 2021.[3][4][5][6]\n7. **^** According to articles 89 to 91 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Supreme Leader of Iran is the head of state, and the President is the head of government. The President is required to gain the Supreme Leader's official approval before being sworn in before Parliament, and the Supreme Leader also has the power to dismiss the elected President at any time.\n8. **^** The constitution of Japan does not define a formal head of state, but the Emperor by unwritten constitutional convention fulfills the functions and duties of this role.\n9. ^ ***a*** ***b*** The Governor-General of New Zealand and the King's Representative of Niue are positions held by the same person.\n10. ^ ***a*** ***b*** The Captain Regent representing the party with a plurality of seats in the legislature of San Marino, the Grand and General Council, exercises more legislative power than the Captain Regent belonging to the opposition.\n11. **^** The Transitional Sovereignty Council is the collective head of state of Sudan per the 2019 Draft Constitutional Declaration. While the council was intended to be a unity government incorporating civilian and military elements that used consensus decision making, Chairman Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, who is also Commander-in-Chief of the Sudanese Armed Forces, has monopolized power.[8][9][10]\n12. **^** The seven-member Swiss Federal Council is collectively head of state and government. As a party to the Council, the President serves solely in a *primus inter pares* capacity for one year.\n13. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Charles III is head of state of the Cook Islands and Niue in his capacity as King in Right of New Zealand. He is represented in each of these states by a King's Representative.\n14. **^** Al-Menfi is also considered head of state by the internationally-recognized Government of National Unity. Hamada is disputing the premiership of Abdul Hamid Dbeibeh, with the backing of the House of Representatives and the Libyan National Army.\n15. **^** Internationally-recognized president also recognized by Hamas since the Palestinian Unity Government of June 2014\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Cai, Derek; Head, Jonathan (7 August 2023). \"Cambodia: PM's son Hun Manet appointed next ruler in royal formality\".

For countries in which the head of state and head of government are separate, both offices are listed. For leaders who held the same office prior to their state's independence, the start of their tenure is used, not independence. For a list of heads of state taking dates of independence into account, see List of heads of state by diplomatic precedence.\n\n\nActing presidents are included in this list, but if a leader has non-consecutive terms, only the current period of service is listed.\n\n\nStates where head of state differs from head of government are mainly parliamentary systems. Often a leader holds both positions in presidential systems or dictatorships. Some states have semi-presidential systems where the head of government role is fulfilled by both the listed head of government and the head of state.\n\n\n\n\n## List of state leaders by date of

For countries in which the head of state and head of government are separate, both offices are listed. For leaders who held the same office prior to their state's independence, the start of their tenure is used, not independence. For a list of heads of state taking dates of independence into account, see List of heads of state by diplomatic precedence.\n\n\nActing presidents are included in this list, but if a leader has non-consecutive terms, only the current period of service is listed.\n\n\nStates where head of state differs from head of government are mainly parliamentary systems. Often a leader holds both positions in presidential systems or dictatorships. Some states have semi-presidential systems where the head of government role is fulfilled by both the listed head of government and the head of state.\n\n\n\n\n## List of state leaders by date of
