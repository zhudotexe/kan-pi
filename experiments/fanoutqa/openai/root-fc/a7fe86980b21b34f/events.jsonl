He is considered by many to be the preeminent synthetic organic chemist of the twentieth century,[3] having made many key contributions to the subject, especially in the synthesis of complex natural products and the determination of their molecular structure. He also worked closely with Roald Hoffmann on theoretical studies of chemical reactions. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1965.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nWoodward was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on April 10, 1917. He was the son of Margaret Burns (an immigrant from Scotland who claimed to be a descendant of the poet, Robert Burns) and her husband, Arthur Chester Woodward, himself the son of Roxbury apothecary, Harlow Elliot Woodward. \n\n\nHis father was one of the many victims of the 1918 influenza pandemic.\n\n\nFrom a very early age, Woodward was attracted to and engaged in private study of chemistry while he attended a public primary school, and then Quincy High School,[4] in Quincy, Massachusetts. By the time he entered high school, he had already managed to perform most of the experiments in Ludwig Gattermann's then widely used textbook of experimental organic chemistry. In 1928, Woodward contacted the Consul-General of the German consulate in Boston (Baron von Tippelskirch [5]), and through him, managed to obtain copies of a few original papers published in German journals. Later, in his Cope lecture, he recalled how he had been fascinated when, among these papers, he chanced upon Diels and Alder's original communication about the Diels–Alder reaction. Throughout his career, Woodward was to repeatedly and powerfully use and investigate this reaction, both in theoretical and experimental ways. In 1933, he entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), but neglected his formal studies badly enough to be excluded at the end of the 1934 fall term. MIT readmitted him in the 1935 fall term, and by 1936 he had received the Bachelor of Science degree. Only one year later, MIT awarded him the doctorate, when his classmates were still graduating with their bachelor's degrees.[6] Woodward's doctoral work involved investigations related to the synthesis of the female sex hormone estrone.[7] MIT required that graduate students have research advisors. Woodward's advisors were James Flack Norris and Avery Adrian Morton,[*citation needed*] although it is not clear whether he actually took any of their advice. After a short postdoctoral stint at the University of Illinois, he took a Junior Fellowship at Harvard University from 1937 to 1938, and remained at Harvard in various capacities for the rest of his life. In the 1960s, Woodward was named Donner Professor of Science, a title that freed him from teaching formal courses so that he could devote his entire time to research.\n\n\n\n## Research and career[edit]\n\n\n### Early work[edit]\n\n\nThe first major contribution of Woodward's career in the early 1940s was a series of papers describing the application of ultraviolet spectroscopy in the elucidation of the structure of natural products. Woodward collected together a large amount of empirical data, and then devised a series of rules later called the Woodward's rules, which could be applied to finding out the structures of new natural substances, as well as non-natural synthesized molecules. The expedient use of newly developed instrumental techniques was a characteristic Woodward exemplified throughout his career, and it marked a radical change from the extremely tedious and long chemical methods of structural elucidation that had been used until then.\n\n\nIn 1944, with his post doctoral researcher, William von Eggers Doering, Woodward reported the synthesis of the alkaloid quinine, used to treat malaria. Although the synthesis was publicized as a breakthrough in procuring the hard to get medicinal compound from Japanese occupied southeast Asia, in reality it was too long and tedious to adopt on a practical scale. Nevertheless, it was a landmark for chemical synthesis. Woodward's particular insight in this synthesis was to realise that the German chemist Paul Rabe had converted a precursor of quinine called quinotoxine to quinine in 1905. Hence, a synthesis of quinotoxine (which Woodward actually synthesized) would establish a route to synthesizing quinine. When Woodward accomplished this feat, organic synthesis was still largely a matter of trial and error, and nobody thought that such complex structures could actually be constructed. Woodward showed that organic synthesis could be made into a rational science, and that synthesis could be aided by well-established principles of reactivity and structure. This synthesis was the first one in a series of exceedingly complicated and elegant syntheses that he would undertake.\n\n\n\n### Later work and its impact[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Woodward talked about Chlorophyll in 1965\nCulminating in the 1930s, the British chemists Christopher Ingold and Robert Robinson among others had investigated the mechanisms of organic reactions, and had come up with empirical rules which could predict reactivity of organic molecules. Woodward was perhaps the first synthetic organic chemist who used these ideas as a predictive framework in synthesis. Woodward's style was the inspiration for the work of hundreds of successive synthetic chemists who synthesized medicinally important and structurally complex natural products.\n\n\n\n### Organic syntheses and Nobel Prize[edit]\n\n\nDuring the late 1940s, Woodward synthesized many complex natural products including quinine, cholesterol, cortisone, strychnine, lysergic acid, reserpine, chlorophyll, cephalosporin, and colchicine.[8] With these, Woodward opened up a new era of synthesis, sometimes called the 'Woodwardian era' in which he showed that natural products could be synthesized by careful applications of the principles of physical organic chemistry, and by meticulous planning.\n\n\nMany of Woodward's syntheses were described as spectacular by his colleagues and before he did them, it was thought by some that it would be impossible to create these substances in the lab. Woodward's syntheses were also described as having an element of art in them, and since then, synthetic chemists have always looked for elegance as well as utility in synthesis. His work also involved the exhaustive use of the then newly developed techniques of infrared spectroscopy and later, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Another important feature of Woodward's syntheses was their attention to stereochemistry or the particular configuration of molecules in three-dimensional space. Most natural products of medicinal importance are effective, for example as drugs, only when they possess a specific stereochemistry. This creates the demand for 'stereoselective synthesis', producing a compound with a defined stereochemistry. While today a typical synthetic route routinely involves such a procedure, Woodward was a pioneer in showing how, with exhaustive and rational planning, one could conduct reactions that were stereoselective. Many of his syntheses involved forcing a molecule into a certain configuration by installing rigid structural elements in it, another tactic that has become standard today. In this regard, especially his syntheses of reserpine and strychnine were landmarks.\n\n\nDuring World War II, Woodward was an advisor to the War Production Board on the penicillin project. Although often given credit for proposing the beta-lactam structure of penicillin, it was actually first proposed by chemists at Merck and Edward Abraham at Oxford and then investigated by other groups, as well (e.g., Shell). Woodward at first endorsed an incorrect tricyclic (thiazolidine fused, amino bridged oxazinone) structure put forth by the penicillin group at Peoria. Subsequently, he put his imprimatur on the beta-lactam structure, all of this in opposition to the thiazolidine–oxazolone structure proposed by Robert Robinson, the then leading organic chemist of his generation. Ultimately, the beta-lactam structure was shown to be correct by Dorothy Hodgkin using X-ray crystallography in 1945.\n\n\nWoodward also applied the technique of infrared spectroscopy and chemical degradation to determine the structures of complicated molecules. Notable among these structure determinations were santonic acid, strychnine, magnamycin and terramycin. In each one of these cases, Woodward again showed how rational facts and chemical principles, combined with chemical intuition, could be used to achieve the task.\n\n\nIn the early 1950s, Woodward, along with the British chemist Geoffrey Wilkinson, then at Harvard, postulated a novel structure for ferrocene, a compound consisting of a combination of an organic molecule with iron.[9] This marked the beginning of the field of transition metal organometallic chemistry which grew into an industrially very significant field.[10] Wilkinson won the Nobel Prize for this work in 1973, along with Ernst Otto Fischer.[11] Some historians think that Woodward should have shared this prize along with Wilkinson. Remarkably, Woodward himself thought so, and voiced his thoughts in a letter sent to the Nobel Committee.[12]\n\n\nWoodward won the Nobel Prize in 1965 for his synthesis of complex organic molecules. He had been nominated a total of 111 times from 1946 to 1965.[13] In his Nobel lecture, he described the total synthesis of the antibiotic cephalosporin, and claimed that he had pushed the synthesis schedule so that it would be completed around the time of the Nobel ceremony.\n\n\n\n### B12 synthesis and Woodward–Hoffmann rules[edit]\n\n\nIn the early 1960s, Woodward began work on what was the most complex natural product synthesized to date—vitamin B12. In a remarkable collaboration with his colleague Albert Eschenmoser in Zurich, a team of almost one hundred students and postdoctoral workers worked for many years on the synthesis of this molecule. The work was finally published in 1973, and it marked a landmark in the history of organic chemistry. The synthesis included almost a hundred steps, and involved the characteristic rigorous planning and analyses that had always characterised Woodward's work. This work, more than any other, convinced organic chemists that the synthesis of any complex substance was possible, given enough time and planning (see also palytoxin, synthesized by the research group of Yoshito Kishi, one of Woodward's postdoctoral students). As of 2019, no other total synthesis of Vitamin B12 has been published.\n\n\nThat same year, based on observations that Woodward had made during the B12 synthesis, he and Roald Hoffmann devised rules (now called the Woodward–Hoffmann rules) for elucidating the stereochemistry of the products of organic reactions.[14] Woodward formulated his ideas (which were based on the symmetry properties of molecular orbitals) based on his experiences as a synthetic organic chemist; he asked Hoffman to perform theoretical calculations to verify these ideas, which were done using Hoffmann's Extended Hückel method. The predictions of these rules, called the \"Woodward–Hoffmann rules\" were verified by many experiments. Hoffmann shared the 1981 Nobel Prize for this work along with Kenichi Fukui, a Japanese chemist who had done similar work using a different approach; Woodward had died in 1979 and Nobel Prizes are not awarded posthumously.\n\n\n\n### Woodward Institute[edit]\n\n\nWhile at Harvard, Woodward took on the directorship of the\n**Woodward Research Institute**, based at Basel, Switzerland, in 1963.[15] He also became a trustee of his alma mater, MIT, from 1966 to 1971, and of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel.\n\n\nWoodward died in Cambridge, Massachusetts, from a heart attack in his sleep. At the time, he was working on the synthesis of an antibiotic, erythromycin. A student of his said about him:[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n*I owe a lot to R. B. Woodward. He showed me that one could attack difficult problems without a clear idea of their outcome, but with confidence that intelligence and effort would solve them. He showed me the beauty of modern organic chemistry, and the relevance to the field of detailed careful reasoning. He showed me that one does not need to specialize. Woodward made great contributions to the strategy of synthesis, to the deduction of difficult structures, to the invention of new chemistry, and to theoretical aspects as well. He taught his students by example the satisfaction that comes from total immersion in our science. I treasure the memory of my association with this remarkable chemist.*\n### Publications[edit]\n\n\nDuring his lifetime Woodward authored or coauthored almost 200 publications, of which 85 are full papers, the remainder comprising preliminary communications, the text of lectures, and reviews. The pace of his scientific activity soon outstripped his capacity to publish all experimental details, and much of the work in which he participated was not published until a few years after his death. Woodward trained more than two hundred Ph.D. students and postdoctoral workers, many of whom later went on to distinguished careers.\n\n\nSome of his best-known students include Robert M. Williams (Colorado State), Harry Wasserman (Yale), Yoshito Kishi (Harvard), Stuart Schreiber (Harvard), William R. Roush (Scripps-Florida), Steven A. Benner (UF), James D. Wuest (Montreal), Christopher S. Foote (UCLA), Kendall Houk (UCLA), porphyrin chemist Kevin M. Smith (LSU), Thomas R. Hoye (University of Minnesota), Ronald Breslow (Columbia University) and David Dolphin (UBC).\n\n\nWoodward had an encyclopaedic knowledge of chemistry, and an extraordinary memory for detail.[16] Probably the quality that most set him apart from his peers was his remarkable ability to tie together disparate threads of knowledge from the chemical literature and bring them to bear on a chemical problem.[16]\n\n\n\n## Honors and awards[edit]\n\n\nFor his work, Woodward received many awards, honors and honorary doctorates, including election to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1948,[17] the National Academy of Sciences in 1953,[18] the American Philosophical Society in 1962,[19] and membership in academies around the world. He was also a consultant to many companies such as Polaroid, Pfizer, and Merck. Other awards include:\n\n\n\n* John Scott Medal, from the Franklin Institute and City of Philadelphia, 1945\n* Leo Hendrik Baekeland Award, from the North Jersey Section of the American Chemical Society, 1955[20]\n* Elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1956[1]\n* Davy Medal, from the Royal Society in 1959\n* Roger Adams Medal, from the American Chemical Society in 1961[*citation needed*]\n* Pius XI Gold Medal, from the Pontifical Academy of Sciences in 1969[*citation needed*]\n* National Medal of Science from the United States in 1964 (\"*For an imaginative new approach to the synthesis of complex organic molecules and, especially, for his brilliant syntheses of strychnine, reserphine, lysergic acid, and chlorophyll.*\")\n* Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1965\n* Willard Gibbs Award from the Chicago Section of the American Chemical Society in 1967[21]\n* Lavoisier Medal from the Société chimique de France in 1968\n* The Order of the Rising Sun, Second Class from the Emperor of Japan in 1970\n* Hanbury Memorial Medal from The Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain in 1970[*citation needed*]\n* Pierre Bruylants Medal from the University of Louvain in 1970[*citation needed*]\n* AMA Scientific Achievement Award in 1971\n* Cope Award from the American Chemical Society, shared with Roald Hoffmann in 1973\n* Copley Medal from the Royal Society, London in 1978\n\n### Honorary degrees[edit]\n\n\nWoodward also received over twenty honorary degrees,[22] including honorary doctorates from the following universities:\n\n\n\n* Wesleyan University in 1945;\n* Harvard University in 1957;\n* University of Cambridge in 1964;[*citation needed*]\n* Brandeis University in 1965;\n* Technion Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa in 1966;\n* University of Western Ontario in Canada in 1968;\n* University of Louvain in Belgium, 1970.\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### Family[edit]\n\n\nIn 1938 he married Irja Pullman; they had two daughters: Siiri Anna (b. 1939) and Jean Kirsten (b. 1944). In 1946, he married Eudoxia Muller, an artist and technician whom he met at the Polaroid Corp. This marriage, which lasted until 1972, produced a daughter, and a son: Crystal Elisabeth (b. 1947), and Eric Richard Arthur (b. 1953).[6]\n\n\n\n### Idiosyncrasies[edit]\n\n\nHis lectures frequently lasted for three or four hours.[5] His longest known lecture defined the unit of time known as the \"Woodward\", after which his other lectures were deemed to be so many \"milli-Woodwards\" long.[23] In many of these, he eschewed the use of slides and drew structures by using multicolored chalk. Typically, to begin a lecture, Woodward would arrive and lay out two large white handkerchiefs on the countertop. Upon one would be four or five colors of chalk (new pieces), neatly sorted by color, in a long row. Upon the other handkerchief would be placed an equally impressive row of cigarettes. The previous cigarette would be used to light the next one. His Thursday seminars at Harvard often lasted well into the night. He had a fixation with blue, and many of his suits, his car, and even his parking space were coloured in blue.[5]\n\n\nIn one of his laboratories, his students hung a large black and white photograph of the master from the ceiling, complete with a large blue \"tie\" appended. There it hung for some years (early 1970s), until scorched in a minor laboratory fire.[*citation needed*] He detested exercise, could get along with only a few hours of sleep every night, was a heavy smoker, and enjoyed Scotch whisky and martinis.[1][24]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Todd, L.; Cornforth, J.; T., A.

He is considered by many to be the preeminent synthetic organic chemist of the twentieth century,[3] having made many key contributions to the subject, especially in the synthesis of complex natural products and the determination of their molecular structure. He also worked closely with Roald Hoffmann on theoretical studies of chemical reactions. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1965.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nWoodward was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on April 10, 1917. He was the son of Margaret Burns (an immigrant from Scotland who claimed to be a descendant of the poet, Robert Burns) and her husband, Arthur Chester Woodward, himself the son of Roxbury apothecary, Harlow Elliot Woodward. \n\n\nHis father was one of the many victims of the 1918 influenza pandemic.\n\n\nFrom a very early age, Woodward was attracted to and engaged in private study of chemistry while he attended a public primary school, and then Quincy High School,[4] in Quincy, Massachusetts. By the time he entered high school, he had already managed to perform most of the experiments in Ludwig Gattermann's then widely used textbook of experimental organic chemistry. In 1928, Woodward contacted the Consul-General of the German consulate in Boston (Baron von Tippelskirch [5]), and through him, managed to obtain copies of a few original papers published in German journals. Later, in his Cope lecture, he recalled how he had been fascinated when, among these papers, he chanced upon Diels and Alder's original communication about the Diels–Alder reaction. Throughout his career, Woodward was to repeatedly and powerfully use and investigate this reaction, both in theoretical and experimental ways. In 1933, he entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), but neglected his formal studies badly enough to be excluded at the end of the 1934 fall term. MIT readmitted him in the 1935 fall term, and by 1936 he had received the Bachelor of Science degree. Only one year later, MIT awarded him the doctorate, when his classmates were still graduating with their bachelor's degrees.[6] Woodward's doctoral work involved investigations related to the synthesis of the female sex hormone estrone.[7] MIT required that graduate students have research advisors. Woodward's advisors were James Flack Norris and Avery Adrian Morton,[*citation needed*] although it is not clear whether he actually took any of their advice. After a short postdoctoral stint at the University of Illinois, he took a Junior Fellowship at Harvard University from 1937 to 1938, and remained at Harvard in various capacities for the rest of his life. In the 1960s, Woodward was named Donner Professor of Science, a title that freed him from teaching formal courses so that he could devote his entire time to research.\n\n\n\n## Research and career[edit]\n\n\n### Early work[edit]\n\n\nThe first major contribution of Woodward's career in the early 1940s was a series of papers describing the application of ultraviolet spectroscopy in the elucidation of the structure of natural products. Woodward collected together a large amount of empirical data, and then devised a series of rules later called the Woodward's rules, which could be applied to finding out the structures of new natural substances, as well as non-natural synthesized molecules. The expedient use of newly developed instrumental techniques was a characteristic Woodward exemplified throughout his career, and it marked a radical change from the extremely tedious and long chemical methods of structural elucidation that had been used until then.\n\n\nIn 1944, with his post doctoral researcher, William von Eggers Doering, Woodward reported the synthesis of the alkaloid quinine, used to treat malaria. Although the synthesis was publicized as a breakthrough in procuring the hard to get medicinal compound from Japanese occupied southeast Asia, in reality it was too long and tedious to adopt on a practical scale. Nevertheless, it was a landmark for chemical synthesis. Woodward's particular insight in this synthesis was to realise that the German chemist Paul Rabe had converted a precursor of quinine called quinotoxine to quinine in 1905. Hence, a synthesis of quinotoxine (which Woodward actually synthesized) would establish a route to synthesizing quinine. When Woodward accomplished this feat, organic synthesis was still largely a matter of trial and error, and nobody thought that such complex structures could actually be constructed. Woodward showed that organic synthesis could be made into a rational science, and that synthesis could be aided by well-established principles of reactivity and structure. This synthesis was the first one in a series of exceedingly complicated and elegant syntheses that he would undertake.\n\n\n\n### Later work and its impact[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Woodward talked about Chlorophyll in 1965\nCulminating in the 1930s, the British chemists Christopher Ingold and Robert Robinson among others had investigated the mechanisms of organic reactions, and had come up with empirical rules which could predict reactivity of organic molecules. Woodward was perhaps the first synthetic organic chemist who used these ideas as a predictive framework in synthesis. Woodward's style was the inspiration for the work of hundreds of successive synthetic chemists who synthesized medicinally important and structurally complex natural products.\n\n\n\n### Organic syntheses and Nobel Prize[edit]\n\n\nDuring the late 1940s, Woodward synthesized many complex natural products including quinine, cholesterol, cortisone, strychnine, lysergic acid, reserpine, chlorophyll, cephalosporin, and colchicine.[8] With these, Woodward opened up a new era of synthesis, sometimes called the 'Woodwardian era' in which he showed that natural products could be synthesized by careful applications of the principles of physical organic chemistry, and by meticulous planning.\n\n\nMany of Woodward's syntheses were described as spectacular by his colleagues and before he did them, it was thought by some that it would be impossible to create these substances in the lab. Woodward's syntheses were also described as having an element of art in them, and since then, synthetic chemists have always looked for elegance as well as utility in synthesis. His work also involved the exhaustive use of the then newly developed techniques of infrared spectroscopy and later, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Another important feature of Woodward's syntheses was their attention to stereochemistry or the particular configuration of molecules in three-dimensional space. Most natural products of medicinal importance are effective, for example as drugs, only when they possess a specific stereochemistry. This creates the demand for 'stereoselective synthesis', producing a compound with a defined stereochemistry. While today a typical synthetic route routinely involves such a procedure, Woodward was a pioneer in showing how, with exhaustive and rational planning, one could conduct reactions that were stereoselective. Many of his syntheses involved forcing a molecule into a certain configuration by installing rigid structural elements in it, another tactic that has become standard today. In this regard, especially his syntheses of reserpine and strychnine were landmarks.\n\n\nDuring World War II, Woodward was an advisor to the War Production Board on the penicillin project. Although often given credit for proposing the beta-lactam structure of penicillin, it was actually first proposed by chemists at Merck and Edward Abraham at Oxford and then investigated by other groups, as well (e.g., Shell). Woodward at first endorsed an incorrect tricyclic (thiazolidine fused, amino bridged oxazinone) structure put forth by the penicillin group at Peoria. Subsequently, he put his imprimatur on the beta-lactam structure, all of this in opposition to the thiazolidine–oxazolone structure proposed by Robert Robinson, the then leading organic chemist of his generation. Ultimately, the beta-lactam structure was shown to be correct by Dorothy Hodgkin using X-ray crystallography in 1945.\n\n\nWoodward also applied the technique of infrared spectroscopy and chemical degradation to determine the structures of complicated molecules. Notable among these structure determinations were santonic acid, strychnine, magnamycin and terramycin. In each one of these cases, Woodward again showed how rational facts and chemical principles, combined with chemical intuition, could be used to achieve the task.\n\n\nIn the early 1950s, Woodward, along with the British chemist Geoffrey Wilkinson, then at Harvard, postulated a novel structure for ferrocene, a compound consisting of a combination of an organic molecule with iron.[9] This marked the beginning of the field of transition metal organometallic chemistry which grew into an industrially very significant field.[10] Wilkinson won the Nobel Prize for this work in 1973, along with Ernst Otto Fischer.[11] Some historians think that Woodward should have shared this prize along with Wilkinson. Remarkably, Woodward himself thought so, and voiced his thoughts in a letter sent to the Nobel Committee.[12]\n\n\nWoodward won the Nobel Prize in 1965 for his synthesis of complex organic molecules. He had been nominated a total of 111 times from 1946 to 1965.[13] In his Nobel lecture, he described the total synthesis of the antibiotic cephalosporin, and claimed that he had pushed the synthesis schedule so that it would be completed around the time of the Nobel ceremony.\n\n\n\n### B12 synthesis and Woodward–Hoffmann rules[edit]\n\n\nIn the early 1960s, Woodward began work on what was the most complex natural product synthesized to date—vitamin B12. In a remarkable collaboration with his colleague Albert Eschenmoser in Zurich, a team of almost one hundred students and postdoctoral workers worked for many years on the synthesis of this molecule. The work was finally published in 1973, and it marked a landmark in the history of organic chemistry. The synthesis included almost a hundred steps, and involved the characteristic rigorous planning and analyses that had always characterised Woodward's work. This work, more than any other, convinced organic chemists that the synthesis of any complex substance was possible, given enough time and planning (see also palytoxin, synthesized by the research group of Yoshito Kishi, one of Woodward's postdoctoral students). As of 2019, no other total synthesis of Vitamin B12 has been published.\n\n\nThat same year, based on observations that Woodward had made during the B12 synthesis, he and Roald Hoffmann devised rules (now called the Woodward–Hoffmann rules) for elucidating the stereochemistry of the products of organic reactions.[14] Woodward formulated his ideas (which were based on the symmetry properties of molecular orbitals) based on his experiences as a synthetic organic chemist; he asked Hoffman to perform theoretical calculations to verify these ideas, which were done using Hoffmann's Extended Hückel method. The predictions of these rules, called the \"Woodward–Hoffmann rules\" were verified by many experiments. Hoffmann shared the 1981 Nobel Prize for this work along with Kenichi Fukui, a Japanese chemist who had done similar work using a different approach; Woodward had died in 1979 and Nobel Prizes are not awarded posthumously.\n\n\n\n### Woodward Institute[edit]\n\n\nWhile at Harvard, Woodward took on the directorship of the\n**Woodward Research Institute**, based at Basel, Switzerland, in 1963.[15] He also became a trustee of his alma mater, MIT, from 1966 to 1971, and of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel.\n\n\nWoodward died in Cambridge, Massachusetts, from a heart attack in his sleep. At the time, he was working on the synthesis of an antibiotic, erythromycin. A student of his said about him:[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n*I owe a lot to R. B. Woodward. He showed me that one could attack difficult problems without a clear idea of their outcome, but with confidence that intelligence and effort would solve them. He showed me the beauty of modern organic chemistry, and the relevance to the field of detailed careful reasoning. He showed me that one does not need to specialize. Woodward made great contributions to the strategy of synthesis, to the deduction of difficult structures, to the invention of new chemistry, and to theoretical aspects as well. He taught his students by example the satisfaction that comes from total immersion in our science. I treasure the memory of my association with this remarkable chemist.*\n### Publications[edit]\n\n\nDuring his lifetime Woodward authored or coauthored almost 200 publications, of which 85 are full papers, the remainder comprising preliminary communications, the text of lectures, and reviews. The pace of his scientific activity soon outstripped his capacity to publish all experimental details, and much of the work in which he participated was not published until a few years after his death. Woodward trained more than two hundred Ph.D. students and postdoctoral workers, many of whom later went on to distinguished careers.\n\n\nSome of his best-known students include Robert M. Williams (Colorado State), Harry Wasserman (Yale), Yoshito Kishi (Harvard), Stuart Schreiber (Harvard), William R. Roush (Scripps-Florida), Steven A. Benner (UF), James D. Wuest (Montreal), Christopher S. Foote (UCLA), Kendall Houk (UCLA), porphyrin chemist Kevin M. Smith (LSU), Thomas R. Hoye (University of Minnesota), Ronald Breslow (Columbia University) and David Dolphin (UBC).\n\n\nWoodward had an encyclopaedic knowledge of chemistry, and an extraordinary memory for detail.[16] Probably the quality that most set him apart from his peers was his remarkable ability to tie together disparate threads of knowledge from the chemical literature and bring them to bear on a chemical problem.[16]\n\n\n\n## Honors and awards[edit]\n\n\nFor his work, Woodward received many awards, honors and honorary doctorates, including election to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1948,[17] the National Academy of Sciences in 1953,[18] the American Philosophical Society in 1962,[19] and membership in academies around the world. He was also a consultant to many companies such as Polaroid, Pfizer, and Merck. Other awards include:\n\n\n\n* John Scott Medal, from the Franklin Institute and City of Philadelphia, 1945\n* Leo Hendrik Baekeland Award, from the North Jersey Section of the American Chemical Society, 1955[20]\n* Elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1956[1]\n* Davy Medal, from the Royal Society in 1959\n* Roger Adams Medal, from the American Chemical Society in 1961[*citation needed*]\n* Pius XI Gold Medal, from the Pontifical Academy of Sciences in 1969[*citation needed*]\n* National Medal of Science from the United States in 1964 (\"*For an imaginative new approach to the synthesis of complex organic molecules and, especially, for his brilliant syntheses of strychnine, reserphine, lysergic acid, and chlorophyll.*\")\n* Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1965\n* Willard Gibbs Award from the Chicago Section of the American Chemical Society in 1967[21]\n* Lavoisier Medal from the Société chimique de France in 1968\n* The Order of the Rising Sun, Second Class from the Emperor of Japan in 1970\n* Hanbury Memorial Medal from The Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain in 1970[*citation needed*]\n* Pierre Bruylants Medal from the University of Louvain in 1970[*citation needed*]\n* AMA Scientific Achievement Award in 1971\n* Cope Award from the American Chemical Society, shared with Roald Hoffmann in 1973\n* Copley Medal from the Royal Society, London in 1978\n\n### Honorary degrees[edit]\n\n\nWoodward also received over twenty honorary degrees,[22] including honorary doctorates from the following universities:\n\n\n\n* Wesleyan University in 1945;\n* Harvard University in 1957;\n* University of Cambridge in 1964;[*citation needed*]\n* Brandeis University in 1965;\n* Technion Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa in 1966;\n* University of Western Ontario in Canada in 1968;\n* University of Louvain in Belgium, 1970.\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### Family[edit]\n\n\nIn 1938 he married Irja Pullman; they had two daughters: Siiri Anna (b. 1939) and Jean Kirsten (b. 1944). In 1946, he married Eudoxia Muller, an artist and technician whom he met at the Polaroid Corp. This marriage, which lasted until 1972, produced a daughter, and a son: Crystal Elisabeth (b. 1947), and Eric Richard Arthur (b. 1953).[6]\n\n\n\n### Idiosyncrasies[edit]\n\n\nHis lectures frequently lasted for three or four hours.[5] His longest known lecture defined the unit of time known as the \"Woodward\", after which his other lectures were deemed to be so many \"milli-Woodwards\" long.[23] In many of these, he eschewed the use of slides and drew structures by using multicolored chalk. Typically, to begin a lecture, Woodward would arrive and lay out two large white handkerchiefs on the countertop. Upon one would be four or five colors of chalk (new pieces), neatly sorted by color, in a long row. Upon the other handkerchief would be placed an equally impressive row of cigarettes. The previous cigarette would be used to light the next one. His Thursday seminars at Harvard often lasted well into the night. He had a fixation with blue, and many of his suits, his car, and even his parking space were coloured in blue.[5]\n\n\nIn one of his laboratories, his students hung a large black and white photograph of the master from the ceiling, complete with a large blue \"tie\" appended. There it hung for some years (early 1970s), until scorched in a minor laboratory fire.[*citation needed*] He detested exercise, could get along with only a few hours of sleep every night, was a heavy smoker, and enjoyed Scotch whisky and martinis.[1][24]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Todd, L.; Cornforth, J.; T., A.

They were originally constructed by the City of Middletown for use by Captain Partridge's American Literary, Scientific, and Military Academy. In 1829, after the Connecticut legislature declined it a charter to grant college degrees, Capt. Alden Partridge moved his academy to Northfield, Vermont. The academy later became Norwich University and the Middletown buildings were acquired by Wesleyan. The book, *Norwich University, 1819-1911, Vol. I* (1911), provides the following description of South College (originally called the Lyceum) and North College (called the Barracks).[37]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThree written histories of Wesleyan have been published, *Wesleyan's First Century* (1932) by Carl F. Price; *Wesleyan University, 1831–1910: Collegiate Enterprise in New England* (1999); and *Wesleyan University, 1910-1970, Academic Ambition and Middle-Class America* (2015), the latter two by David B. Potts. Before Wesleyan was founded, a military academy established by Captain Alden Partridge existed on the land, consisting of the campus's North and South Colleges. As this academy failed, New England Methodists bought it and transformed it into a scholarly institution. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n215. **^** BEALS, SHAWN R.

Founded in 1831 as a men's college under the Methodist Episcopal Church and with the support of prominent residents of Middletown, the college was the first institution of higher education to be named after John Wesley, the founder of Methodism. It is now a secular institution.\n\n\nThe college accepted female applicants from 1872 to 1909, but did not become fully co-educational until 1970. Before full co-education, Wesleyan alumni and other supporters of women's education established Connecticut College in 1912.[5][6] Alumni of the college include three Truman scholars, three Guggenheim fellows, and seven MacArthur fellows. \n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"NAICU – Membership\".

They were originally constructed by the City of Middletown for use by Captain Partridge's American Literary, Scientific, and Military Academy. In 1829, after the Connecticut legislature declined it a charter to grant college degrees, Capt. Alden Partridge moved his academy to Northfield, Vermont. The academy later became Norwich University and the Middletown buildings were acquired by Wesleyan. The book, *Norwich University, 1819-1911, Vol. I* (1911), provides the following description of South College (originally called the Lyceum) and North College (called the Barracks).[37]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThree written histories of Wesleyan have been published, *Wesleyan's First Century* (1932) by Carl F.

Potts. Before Wesleyan was founded, a military academy established by Captain Alden Partridge existed on the land, consisting of the campus's North and South Colleges. As this academy failed, New England Methodists bought it and transformed it into a scholarly institution. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n215. **^** BEALS, SHAWN R.

It is now a secular institution.\n\n\nThe college accepted female applicants from 1872 to 1909, but did not become fully co-educational until 1970. Before full co-education, Wesleyan alumni and other supporters of women's education established Connecticut College in 1912.[5][6] Alumni of the college include three Truman scholars, three Guggenheim fellows, and seven MacArthur fellows. \n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"NAICU – Membership\".

The \"Barracks\" was four stories high, 150 feet long and 52 feet wide, with a large attic and basement. Halls extended the full length of the building. The \"Lyceum\" was located 20 feet south of the Barracks, was three stories high, with a basement partly above the ground. At the front of the building was a tower 14×16 feet and 73 feet high. The basement floor was used for an arsenal and laboratory and the first and second floors for classrooms; the third floor called the \"Hall of the Lyceum\" was used as a chapel and drill room, and for public services.[38]\n\n\nThe original North College was destroyed in a fire in 1906, but South College survived, being converted into offices that same year. The cupola and the belfry, which contains the Wesleyan Carillon, was designed by Henry Bacon and was added in 1916.[39]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n209. **^** Connecticut Archives Online Archived 2012-01-14 at the Wayback Machine.

Its first headmaster, Nathaniel Eaton, took office the following year. In 1638, the university acquired British North America's first known printing press.[21][22]\n\n\nIn 1639, it was named Harvard College after John Harvard, an English clergyman who had died soon after immigrating to Massachusetts, bequeathing it £780 and his library of some 320 volumes.[23] The charter creating Harvard Corporation was granted in 1650.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)John Harvard statue on Harvard Yard\nIn the 19th century, Enlightenment ideas of reason and free will were widespread among Congregational ministers, putting those ministers and their congregations at odds with more traditionalist, Calvinist parties.[28]: 1–4 When Hollis Professor of Divinity David Tappan died in 1803 and President Joseph Willard died a year later, a struggle broke out over their replacements. Henry Ware was elected Hollis chair in 1805, and liberal Samuel Webber was appointed president two years later, signaling a shift from traditional ideas at Harvard to liberal, Arminian ideas.[28]: 4–5[29]: 24\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHarvard's founding was authorized by the Massachusetts colonial legislature, \"dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to the churches\"; though never formally affiliated with any denomination, in its early years, Harvard College primarily trained Congregational clergy. Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th century. By the 19th century, Harvard emerged as the most prominent academic and cultural institution among the Boston elite.[10][11] Following the American Civil War, under President Charles William Eliot's long tenure (1869–1909), the college developed multiple affiliated professional schools that transformed the college into a modern research university. In 1900, Harvard co-founded the Association of American Universities.[12] James B. Conant led the university through the Great Depression and World War II, and liberalized admissions after the war.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Wright, Conrad Edick. *Revolutionary Generation: Harvard Men and the Consequences of Independence* (2005). 298 pp.\n\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n**Harvard University** at Wikipedia's sister projects\n\n* ![](image)Media from Commons\n* ![](image)Quotations from Wikiquote\n* ![](image)Texts from Wikisource\n* ![](image)Data from Wikidata\n\n![](image)\n\nScholia has an *organization* profile for ***Harvard University***.\n\n* Official website ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n* Harvard University at College Navigator, a tool from the National Center for Education Statistics\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nHarvard University\n |\n| --- |\n| * History\n* John Harvard\n\t+ statue\n* President Alan Garber\n* Board of Overseers\n* President and Fellows\n* Provost John Manning\n* Library\n |\n| Arts and Sciences | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Dean Hopi Hoekstra\n |\n| College | * Dean Rakesh Khurana\n* Radcliffe College\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFormer First Lady of the United States Michelle Obama (JD, 1988)\n* ![Biochemist and Nobel laureate in chemistry Jennifer Doudna (PhD, 1989)[137]](image)\n\nBiochemist and Nobel laureate in chemistry Jennifer Doudna (PhD, 1989)[137]\n* ![44th President of the United States and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Barack Obama (JD, 1991)[138][139]](image)\n\n44th President of the United States and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Barack Obama (JD, 1991)[138][139]\n* ![Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States Neil Gorsuch (JD, 1991)](image)\n\nAssociate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States Neil Gorsuch (JD, 1991)\n* ![Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States Ketanji Brown Jackson (AB, 1992; JD, 1996)](image)\n\nAssociate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States Ketanji Brown Jackson (AB, 1992; JD, 1996)\n* ![Founder of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg (College, 2004;[a 1] LLD hc, 2017)](image)\n\nFounder of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg (College, 2004;[a 1] LLD hc, 2017)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t8.

Its first headmaster, Nathaniel Eaton, took office the following year. In 1638, the university acquired British North America's first known printing press.[21][22]\n\n\nIn 1639, it was named Harvard College after John Harvard, an English clergyman who had died soon after immigrating to Massachusetts, bequeathing it £780 and his library of some 320 volumes.[23] The charter creating Harvard Corporation was granted in 1650.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)John Harvard statue on Harvard Yard\nIn the 19th century, Enlightenment ideas of reason and free will were widespread among Congregational ministers, putting those ministers and their congregations at odds with more traditionalist, Calvinist parties.[28]: 1–4 When Hollis Professor of Divinity David Tappan died in 1803 and President Joseph Willard died a year later, a struggle broke out over their replacements. Henry Ware was elected Hollis chair in 1805, and liberal Samuel Webber was appointed president two years later, signaling a shift from traditional ideas at Harvard to liberal, Arminian ideas.[28]: 4–5[29]: 24\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHarvard's founding was authorized by the Massachusetts colonial legislature, \"dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to the churches\"; though never formally affiliated with any denomination, in its early years, Harvard College primarily trained Congregational clergy. Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th century. By the 19th century, Harvard emerged as the most prominent academic and cultural institution among the Boston elite.[10][11] Following the American Civil War, under President Charles William Eliot's long tenure (1869–1909), the college developed multiple affiliated professional schools that transformed the college into a modern research university. In 1900, Harvard co-founded the Association of American Universities.[12] James B.

But since women were not yet admitted to the Bachelor of Arts degree program, they were excluded from the university's governance structure. Since University of Cambridge students must belong to a college, and since established colleges remained closed to women, women found admissions restricted to few university colleges that had been established only for them. Darwin College, the first graduate college of the university, matriculated both male and female students from its inception in 1964 and elected a mixed fellowship. Undergraduate colleges, starting with Churchill, Clare, and King's Colleges, began admitting women between 1972 and 1988. Among women's colleges at the university, Girton began admitting male students in 1979, and Lucy Cavendish began admitting men in 2021. But the other female-only colleges have remained female-only colleges as of 2023. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n31. **^** Cambridge University Physics Society (1995).

Churchill, for example, has a reputation for its expertise and focus on the sciences and engineering, in part due to the requirement made by Winston Churchill upon the college's founding that 70% of its students studied mathematics, engineering, and the sciences.[67] Other colleges have more informal academic focus and even demonstrated ideological focus, such as King's, which is known for its left-wing political orientation,[68] and Robinson and Churchill, both of which have a reputation for academic focus on sustainability and environmentalism.[69]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFor the first several centuries of its existence, as was the case broadly in England and the world, the University of Cambridge was only open to male students.

Prior to ultimately being permitted admission to the university in 1948, female students were granted the right to take University of Cambridge exams beginning in the late 19th century.[36] Women were also allowed to study courses, take examinations, and have prior exam results recorded retroactively, dating back to 1881; for a brief period after the turn of the 20th century, this allowed the steamboat ladies to receive *ad eundem* degrees from the University of Dublin.[37]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Institute of Continuing Education at Madingley Hall\n![](image)Old Schools (left) houses the university's administrative offices.\nIn addition to the 31 colleges, the university maintains over 150 departments, faculties, schools, syndicates, and other academic institutions.[75] Members of these are usually members of one of the colleges, and responsibility for the entire academic programme of the university is divided among them.\n\n\nThe university has a department dedicated to providing continuing education, the Institute of Continuing Education, which is based primarily in Madingley Hall, a 16th-century manor house in Cambridgeshire.

Notable female scientists include biochemist Marjory Stephenson, plant physiologist Gabrielle Howard, social anthropologist Audrey Richards, psychoanalyst Alix Strachey, who with her husband translated the works of Sigmund Freud, Kavli Prize-winner Brenda Milner, respnsible for co-discovering specialised brain networks for memory and cognition. Veterinary epidemiologist Sarah Cleaveland has contributed to advances in eliminating rabies in the Serengeti.[187]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn medieval times, many colleges were founded so that their members could pray for the souls of the founders. University of Cambridge colleges often were associated with chapels or abbeys. The colleges' focus began to shift in 1536, however, with the dissolution of the monasteries and Henry VIII's order that the university disband the canon law that governed the university's faculty[23] and stop teaching scholastic philosophy. In response, colleges changed their curricula from canon law to classics, the Bible, and mathematics.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOne such discontinued tradition is that of the wooden spoon, the prize awarded to the student with the lowest passing honours grade in the final examinations of the university's Mathematical Tripos. The last of these spoons was awarded in 1909 to Cuthbert Lempriere Holthouse, an oarsman of the Lady Margaret Boat Club at St John's College. It was over one metre in length and had an oar blade for a handle. It can now be seen outside the Senior Combination Room of St John's College. Since 1908, examination results have been published alphabetically within class rather than in strict order of merit, which made it difficult to ascertain the student with the lowest passing grade deserving of the spoon, leading to discontinuation of the tradition.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSee also: List of chancellors of the University of Cambridge and List of vice-chancellors of the University of Cambridge\n\n![](image)Regent House officers following a July 2014 graduation ceremony\n![](image)Faculty of Divinity at the university\nThe Chancellor of the university is limitless term position that is mainly ceremonial and is held currently by David Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury of Turville, who succeeded the Duke of Edinburgh following his retirement on his 90th birthday in June 2011. Lord Sainsbury was nominated by the nomination board.[78][79][80][81] The election took place on 14 and 15 October 2011[81] with Sainsbury taking 2,893 of the 5,888 votes cast, and winning on the election's first count.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe colleges are self-governing institutions with their own endowments and property, each founded as components of the university. All students and most academics are attached to a college. The colleges' importance lies in the housing, welfare, social functions, and undergraduate teaching they provide. All faculties, departments, research centres, and laboratories belong to the university, which arranges lectures and awards degrees but undergraduates receive their overall academic supervision through small group teaching sessions, which often include just one student within the colleges, though in many cases students go to other colleges for supervision if the teaching fellows at their college do not specialise in a student's particular area of academic focus. Each college appoints its own teaching staff and fellows, both of whom are members of a university department. The colleges also decide which undergraduates to admit to the university, in accordance with university standards and regulations.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPrior to the founding of the University of Cambridge in 1209, Cambridge and the area surrounding it already had developed a scholarly and ecclesiastical reputation due largely to the intellectual reputation and academic contributions of monks from the nearby bishopric church in Ely. The founding of the University of Cambridge, however, was inspired largely by an incident at the University of Oxford during which three Oxford scholars, as an administration of justice in the death of a local Oxford-area woman, were hanged by town authorities without first consulting ecclesiastical authorities, who traditionally would be inclined to pardon scholars in such cases. But during this time, Oxford's town authorities were in conflict with King John. Fearing more violence from Oxford townsfolk, University of Oxford scholars began leaving Oxford for more hospitable cities, including Paris, Reading, and Cambridge. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMore recently, Ian Wilmut was part of the team responsible for the first cloning of a mammal (Dolly the Sheep in 1996), naturalist and broadcaster David Attenborough, ethologist Jane Goodall, expert on chimpanzees was a PhD student at the university, anthropologist Dame Alison Richard, former vice-chancellor of the university, and Frederick Sanger, a biochemist known for developing Sanger sequencing and receiving two Nobel prizes.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFaculty boards are accountable to the general board; other boards and syndicates are accountable either to the general board or to the council. Under this organizational structure, the university's various arms are kept under supervision of both the central administration and Regent House.[91]\n\n\n\n### Finances[edit]\n\n\n#### Benefactions and fundraising[edit]\n\n\nIn the fiscal year ending 31 July 2019, the central university, excluding colleges, reported total income of £2.192 billion, of which £592.4 million was from research grants and contracts.[4] In the decade prior to 2019, the University of Cambridge reported an average of £271m a year in philanthropic donations.[4]\n\n\nThe university maintains multiple scholarship programs.

Due to a high proportion of applicants receiving the highest school grades, an interview process was introduced as a component of consideration for admission. Interviews are performed by College Fellows, who evaluate candidates on unexamined factors including potential for original thinking and creativity.[114] For exceptional candidates, a matriculation offer is sometimes offered, requiring only two A-levels at grade E or above.

Many nobles, intellectuals, and even commoners saw the Church of England as too similar to the Catholic Church and felt that it was being used by The Crown to usurp the counties' rightful powers. East Anglia emerged as the centre of what ultimately became the Puritan movement. In Cambridge, the Puritan movement was particularly strong at Emmanuel, St Catharine Hall, Sidney Sussex, and Christ's Colleges.[24] These colleges produced many non-conformist graduates who greatly influenced, by social position or preaching, some 20,000 Puritans who ultimately left England for New England and especially Massachusetts Bay Colony during the Great Migration decade of the 1630s, joining the Virginia colony and others in becoming settlers in some of the fledgling American colonies.\n\n\n\n### Mathematics and mathematical physics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Lucasian Professor of Mathematics and Mathematical Tripos\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe University of Cambridge has research departments and teaching faculties in nearly every academic discipline, and ll research and lectures are conducted by university departments. The colleges are charged with giving or arranging most supervisions, student accommodation, and funding most extracurricular activities. During the 1990s, the University of Cambridge added a substantial number of new specialist research laboratories on several sites around the city, and major expansion continues.[147] From 2000 to 2006, the University of Cambridge maintained a research partnership with MIT in the United States, known as the Cambridge–MIT Institute, which was discontinued after evolving into what is now called the CMI Partnership Programme.\n\n\n\n### Graduation tradition and ceremony[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe university established its Local Examination Syndicate in 1858, now known as Cambridge University Press & Assessment after its merger with Cambridge University Press.

Each has an elected supervisory body known as a Council, composed of representatives of the various constituent bodies. The University of Cambridge maintains six such schools:[77]\n\n\n\n* Arts and Humanities\n* Biological Sciences\n* Clinical Medicine\n* Humanities and Social Sciences\n* Physical Sciences\n* Technology\n\nTeaching and research at the university is organised by faculties. The faculties have varying organisational substructures that partly reflect their respective histories and the university's operational needs, which may include a number of departments and other institutions. A small number of bodies called syndicates hold responsibility for teaching and research, including for the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate, the University Press, and the University Library.\n\n\n\n### Central administration[edit]\n\n\n#### Chancellor and Vice-Chancellor[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2021, Cambridge Students' Union launched a petition opposing the financial collaboration between the university and the government of United Arab Emirates that was worth £400m. The Union cited a \"values gap\" and threat to \"academic freedom and institutional autonomy\" following the release of internal UAE documents. Citing UAE's history of violating international human rights laws, it warned that university staff were vulnerable under the partnership to repression by gender, sexuality, or freedom of expression.[182]\n\n\nIn 2023, 72% of the Students' Union voted in favour of hosting talks regarding the removal of all animal products from cafes and canteens operated by the university's catering services. The students backed vegan food in response to threats to the climate and biodiversity. The vote is non-binding since the university controls the catering service.[183] After the vote, Darwin College decided to serve only vegan food at its May Ball in 2023.[184]\n\n\n\n## Notable alumni and academics[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe college faculties are responsible for giving lectures, arranging seminars, performing research, and determining the syllabi for teaching, all of which is overseen by the university's general board. Together with the central administration headed by the Vice-Chancellor, the college faculties make up the University of Cambridge. Facilities such as libraries are provided on all these levels by the university. The Cambridge University Library is the university's largest and primary library. Squire Law Library is the primary library for the university's students of law. Individual colleges each maintain a multi-discipline library designed for each college's respective undergraduates.\n\n\nThe university is legally structured as an exempt charity and a common law corporation.

But since women were not yet admitted to the Bachelor of Arts degree program, they were excluded from the university's governance structure. Since University of Cambridge students must belong to a college, and since established colleges remained closed to women, women found admissions restricted to few university colleges that had been established only for them. Darwin College, the first graduate college of the university, matriculated both male and female students from its inception in 1964 and elected a mixed fellowship. Undergraduate colleges, starting with Churchill, Clare, and King's Colleges, began admitting women between 1972 and 1988. Among women's colleges at the university, Girton began admitting male students in 1979, and Lucy Cavendish began admitting men in 2021.

Some colleges maintain a relative strength and associated reputation for expertise in certain academic disciplines. Churchill, for example, has a reputation for its expertise and focus on the sciences and engineering, in part due to the requirement made by Winston Churchill upon the college's founding that 70% of its students studied mathematics, engineering, and the sciences.[67] Other colleges have more informal academic focus and even demonstrated ideological focus, such as King's, which is known for its left-wing political orientation,[68] and Robinson and Churchill, both of which have a reputation for academic focus on sustainability and environmentalism.[69]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFor the first several centuries of its existence, as was the case broadly in England and the world, the University of Cambridge was only open to male students.

University of Cambridge colleges often were associated with chapels or abbeys. The colleges' focus began to shift in 1536, however, with the dissolution of the monasteries and Henry VIII's order that the university disband the canon law that governed the university's faculty[23] and stop teaching scholastic philosophy. In response, colleges changed their curricula from canon law to classics, the Bible, and mathematics.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOne such discontinued tradition is that of the wooden spoon, the prize awarded to the student with the lowest passing honours grade in the final examinations of the university's Mathematical Tripos. The last of these spoons was awarded in 1909 to Cuthbert Lempriere Holthouse, an oarsman of the Lady Margaret Boat Club at St John's College. It was over one metre in length and had an oar blade for a handle. It can now be seen outside the Senior Combination Room of St John's College. Since 1908, examination results have been published alphabetically within class rather than in strict order of merit, which made it difficult to ascertain the student with the lowest passing grade deserving of the spoon, leading to discontinuation of the tradition.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSee also: List of chancellors of the University of Cambridge and List of vice-chancellors of the University of Cambridge\n\n![](image)Regent House officers following a July 2014 graduation ceremony\n![](image)Faculty of Divinity at the university\nThe Chancellor of the university is limitless term position that is mainly ceremonial and is held currently by David Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury of Turville, who succeeded the Duke of Edinburgh following his retirement on his 90th birthday in June 2011.

All students and most academics are attached to a college. The colleges' importance lies in the housing, welfare, social functions, and undergraduate teaching they provide. All faculties, departments, research centres, and laboratories belong to the university, which arranges lectures and awards degrees but undergraduates receive their overall academic supervision through small group teaching sessions, which often include just one student within the colleges, though in many cases students go to other colleges for supervision if the teaching fellows at their college do not specialise in a student's particular area of academic focus. Each college appoints its own teaching staff and fellows, both of whom are members of a university department. The colleges also decide which undergraduates to admit to the university, in accordance with university standards and regulations.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPrior to the founding of the University of Cambridge in 1209, Cambridge and the area surrounding it already had developed a scholarly and ecclesiastical reputation due largely to the intellectual reputation and academic contributions of monks from the nearby bishopric church in Ely. The founding of the University of Cambridge, however, was inspired largely by an incident at the University of Oxford during which three Oxford scholars, as an administration of justice in the death of a local Oxford-area woman, were hanged by town authorities without first consulting ecclesiastical authorities, who traditionally would be inclined to pardon scholars in such cases. But during this time, Oxford's town authorities were in conflict with King John. Fearing more violence from Oxford townsfolk, University of Oxford scholars began leaving Oxford for more hospitable cities, including Paris, Reading, and Cambridge. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMore recently, Ian Wilmut was part of the team responsible for the first cloning of a mammal (Dolly the Sheep in 1996), naturalist and broadcaster David Attenborough, ethologist Jane Goodall, expert on chimpanzees was a PhD student at the university, anthropologist Dame Alison Richard, former vice-chancellor of the university, and Frederick Sanger, a biochemist known for developing Sanger sequencing and receiving two Nobel prizes.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFaculty boards are accountable to the general board; other boards and syndicates are accountable either to the general board or to the council. Under this organizational structure, the university's various arms are kept under supervision of both the central administration and Regent House.[91]\n\n\n\n### Finances[edit]\n\n\n#### Benefactions and fundraising[edit]\n\n\nIn the fiscal year ending 31 July 2019, the central university, excluding colleges, reported total income of £2.192 billion, of which £592.4 million was from research grants and contracts.[4] In the decade prior to 2019, the University of Cambridge reported an average of £271m a year in philanthropic donations.[4]\n\n\nThe university maintains multiple scholarship programs. The Stormzy Scholarship for Black UK Students covers tuition costs for two students and maintenance grants for up to four years.[92]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n146. **^** Postman, Neil (1992). *Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology*.

Many nobles, intellectuals, and even commoners saw the Church of England as too similar to the Catholic Church and felt that it was being used by The Crown to usurp the counties' rightful powers. East Anglia emerged as the centre of what ultimately became the Puritan movement. In Cambridge, the Puritan movement was particularly strong at Emmanuel, St Catharine Hall, Sidney Sussex, and Christ's Colleges.[24] These colleges produced many non-conformist graduates who greatly influenced, by social position or preaching, some 20,000 Puritans who ultimately left England for New England and especially Massachusetts Bay Colony during the Great Migration decade of the 1630s, joining the Virginia colony and others in becoming settlers in some of the fledgling American colonies.\n\n\n\n### Mathematics and mathematical physics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Lucasian Professor of Mathematics and Mathematical Tripos\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe University of Cambridge has research departments and teaching faculties in nearly every academic discipline, and ll research and lectures are conducted by university departments.

During the 1990s, the University of Cambridge added a substantial number of new specialist research laboratories on several sites around the city, and major expansion continues.[147] From 2000 to 2006, the University of Cambridge maintained a research partnership with MIT in the United States, known as the Cambridge–MIT Institute, which was discontinued after evolving into what is now called the CMI Partnership Programme.\n\n\n\n### Graduation tradition and ceremony[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe university established its Local Examination Syndicate in 1858, now known as Cambridge University Press & Assessment after its merger with Cambridge University Press.

Citing UAE's history of violating international human rights laws, it warned that university staff were vulnerable under the partnership to repression by gender, sexuality, or freedom of expression.[182]\n\n\nIn 2023, 72% of the Students' Union voted in favour of hosting talks regarding the removal of all animal products from cafes and canteens operated by the university's catering services. The students backed vegan food in response to threats to the climate and biodiversity. The vote is non-binding since the university controls the catering service.[183] After the vote, Darwin College decided to serve only vegan food at its May Ball in 2023.[184]\n\n\n\n## Notable alumni and academics[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe college faculties are responsible for giving lectures, arranging seminars, performing research, and determining the syllabi for teaching, all of which is overseen by the university's general board. Together with the central administration headed by the Vice-Chancellor, the college faculties make up the University of Cambridge. Facilities such as libraries are provided on all these levels by the university. The Cambridge University Library is the university's largest and primary library. Squire Law Library is the primary library for the university's students of law. Individual colleges each maintain a multi-discipline library designed for each college's respective undergraduates.\n\n\nThe university is legally structured as an exempt charity and a common law corporation.

It was established in 1958 by Lawrence A. and Mae Wien. The family had three objectives: to further international understanding, to provide foreign students an opportunity to study in the United States, and to enrich the intellectual and cultural life at Brandeis. The Wien Scholarship offers full or partial tuition awards; these awards are need-based and require the applicants to present outstanding academic and personal achievement. Each year, the recipients of the scholarship take a week-long tour of a destination in the United States. In previous years, the students have visited the United Nations in New York City, and did relief work in New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina. In April 2008, the university hosted a three-day-long celebration for the 50th anniversary of the program.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Pasternack, Susan, ed.

It was established in 1958 by Lawrence A. and Mae Wien. The family had three objectives: to further international understanding, to provide foreign students an opportunity to study in the United States, and to enrich the intellectual and cultural life at Brandeis. The Wien Scholarship offers full or partial tuition awards; these awards are need-based and require the applicants to present outstanding academic and personal achievement. Each year, the recipients of the scholarship take a week-long tour of a destination in the United States. In previous years, the students have visited the United Nations in New York City, and did relief work in New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina. In April 2008, the university hosted a three-day-long celebration for the 50th anniversary of the program.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Pasternack, Susan, ed.

The position of chancellor is a four-year, non-renewable term.[69] The university's current chancellor is Kelly Meighen, who was appointed to the position on 1 July 2023.[70]\n\n\n\n### Affiliated institutions[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1923, the university was renamed as The University of Western Ontario.[1][11] The first two buildings constructed by architect John Moore and Co. at the new site were the Arts Building (now University College) and the Natural Science Building (now the Physics and Astronomy Building).[18] Classes on the university's present site began in 1924.[19] The University College tower, one of the university's most distinctive features, was named the Middlesex Memorial Tower in honour of the men from Middlesex County who fought in World War I.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nUniversity College in June 1924\n![](image)\nUniversity College in October 2018\nCompleted in 1924, University College is one of the earliest university buildings built on the present campus\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the early 20th century, a number of institution became affiliated colleges of Western. In 1919, Brescia College was established as a Roman Catholic affiliate of Western, while Assumption College entered an affiliation agreement with the university.[12][20] Other institutions that became affiliated colleges of Western includes the Waterloo College of Arts in 1925, St. Peter's College in 1939, and King's College in 1945.[12] Waterloo College of Arts remained affiliated with Western until 1960, when the institution was reorganized into Wilfrid Laurier University; while Assumption College remained affiliated with Western until 1964, when it was reorganized into the University of Windsor.[12][20][21] Brescia, Huron, and King's remain affiliated with Western.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n78. **^** \"Affiliated University Colleges\".

The main campus is located on 455 hectares (1,120 acres) of land, surrounded by residential neighbourhoods and the Thames River bisecting the campus's eastern portion. The university operates twelve academic faculties and schools.\n\n\nThe university was founded on 7 March 1878 by Bishop Isaac Hellmuth of the Anglican Diocese of Huron as **the Western University of London, Ontario**.[2] It incorporated Huron College, which had been founded in 1863. The first four faculties were Arts, Divinity, Law and Medicine. The university became non-denominational in 1908. Beginning in 1919, the university had affiliated with several denominational colleges. The university grew substantially in the post-World War II era, and a number of faculties and schools were added.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** The university's main campus is located on 1151 Richmond Street in London, Ontario. However, in addition to its main campus the university also operates other facilities throughout southwestern Ontario.\n2. **^** The following includes full-time, and part-time students enrolled at the university. The following figures do not include students enrolled with an affiliate institutions of Western, including Brescia, King, and Huron university colleges.\n3. **^** The following includes students enrolled in a first professional degree program.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWestern also maintains academic and administrative links with the Museum of Ontario Archaeology. The Museum originally grew out of a collection of artifacts housed in various buildings throughout London, including Western's University College, and Middlesex College. Formally opened on 28 February 1978, its creation was facilitated by the university president and Western's Faculty of Social Science. Although the museum was incorporated as an independent charitable organization, without the ability to share capital, its directors continued to be appointed by the university's Board of Governors.[37]\n\n\n\n### Housing and student facilities[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n54. **^** Wallace, Janis (11 May 2010). \"Estate of grace\". *London Free Press*.

Many of the university's earliest buildings used Collegiate Gothic designs, a characteristic confirmed in Western's master building plan in 1934.[26] As the campus expanded in the late 1960s, the university abandoned earlier commitments to Collegiate Gothic designs in favour of brutalist and modernist architectural designs.[26] In 2000, planning for Western's central campus was re-conceptualized, with the core devoted for only academic buildings. The plan saw University College Hill as the focal point, linking the lower portion of the campus with the South Valley[26] The 2006 campus master plan called for the protection and renewed emphasis on Western's Collegiate Gothic buildings.[26] The university's boiler room/power plant is the oldest building on the university's central campus, opening in 1922.[27] The oldest academic buildings within the central campus is University College and the Physics and Astronomy Building. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn September 2021, several students were alleged to have been sexually assaulted during Western's orientation week. The incidents surfaced after numerous reports of sexual assault, many facilitated by drugs, surfaced on the internet. The resulting incidents has resulted in some criticism against the university for failing to protect female students from rape culture.[160] These events took place during a period known as the \"Red Zone.\" This is the period encompassing the first eight weeks of the university school year in which 50% of sexual-assaults take place.[161] In the same week, a first-year Western student was killed near the university; a suspect was later charged with manslaughter in connection with the incident.[162]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of University of Western Ontario people\n\n* ![John Robarts, 17th Premier of Ontario](image)\n\nJohn Robarts, 17th Premier of Ontario\n* ![Sir Frederick Banting, awarded the Nobel Prize for the first use of insulin on humans](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| University rankings |\n| --- |\n| Global rankings |\n| *ARWU* World[92] | 201–300 |\n| *QS* World[93] | 172 |\n| *QS* Employability[94] | 43 |\n| *Times* World[95] | 201–250 |\n| *U.S News & World Report* Global[96] | 300 |\n| Canadian rankings |\n| *ARWU* National[92] | 9–12 |\n| *QS* National[93] | 8 |\n| *Times* National[95] | 8–10 |\n| *U.S News & World Report* National[96] | 10 |\n| *Maclean's* Medical/Doctoral[97] | 11 |\n| *Maclean's* Reputation[98] | 13 |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUniversities in Canada\n |\n| --- |\n| Alberta | * Alberta\n* Arts\n* Athabasca\n* Calgary\n* Lethbridge\n* MacEwan\n* Mount Royal\n |\n| British Columbia | * British Columbia\n* Canada West\n* Capilano\n* Emily Carr\n* Fraser Valley\n* Kwantlen Polytechnic\n* Northern British Columbia\n* Royal Roads\n* Simon Fraser\n* Thompson Rivers\n* Trinity Western\n* Vancouver Island\n* Victoria\n |\n| Manitoba | * Brandon\n* Canadian Mennonite\n* Manitoba\n* Saint-Boniface\n* Winnipeg\n |\n| Newfoundland and Labrador | * Memorial\n |\n| New Brunswick | * Crandall\n* Fredericton\n* Moncton\n* Mount Allison\n* New Brunswick\n* St. Stephen's\n* St. Thomas\n* Yorkville\n |\n| Nova Scotia | * Acadia\n* AST\n* Cape Breton\n* Dalhousie\n* King's\n* Mount Saint Vincent\n* NSCAD\n* Saint Francis Xavier\n* Saint Mary's\n* Sainte-Anne\n |\n| Ontario | * Algoma\n* Brock\n* Carleton\n* Guelph\n* Hearst\n* Lakehead\n* Laurentian\n* Laurier\n* McMaster\n* Nipissing\n* NOSM\n* OCAD U\n* Ontario Tech\n* Ottawa\n* Queen's\n* RMC\n* Sudbury\n* TMU\n* Toronto\n* Trent\n* UOF\n* Waterloo\n* Western\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe University of Western Ontario| ![](image)Coat of arms\n |\n| Latin: *Universitas Occidentis Ontariensis* |\n| Other name\n | Western University |\n| Former names\n | The Western University of London, Ontario[1] |\n| Motto | *Veritas et Utilitas* (Latin) |\n| Motto in English\n | Truth and usefulness |\n| Type | Public |\n| Established | 7 March 1878; 146 years ago (1878-03-07)[2] |\n| Academic affiliations\n | ACU, CARL, COU, CUSID, Fields Institute, Universities Canada, U15 |\n| Endowment | CA$1.14 billion (2023)[3] |\n| Budget | CA$901.5 million[4] |\n| Chancellor | Kelly Meighen |\n| President | Alan Shepard |\n| Provost | Florentine Strzelczyk |\n| Academic staff\n | 1,391[5] |\n| Undergraduates | 33,638[6] |\n| Postgraduates | 6,597[7] |\n| Location | London, Ontario, Canada[a]\n43°00′30″N 81°16′21″W﻿ / ﻿43.00833°N 81.27250°W﻿ / 43.00833; -81.27250 |\n| Campus | Urban, 455 hectares (1,120 acres)[8] |\n| Colours | Purple and white[9]    |\n| Nickname | Mustangs |\n| Sporting affiliations\n | U Sports, OUA |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| People | * List of University of Western Ontario people\n\t+ List of King's University College people\n |\n| * **Founded**: 1878\n* **Students**: 30,235\n* **Endowment**: C$746.5 million\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nLondon, Ontario\n |\n| --- |\n| Government | * City Council\n* Mayors\n* 2022 municipal election\n* Federal/provincial electoral ridings\n\t+ London North Centre\n\t\t- F/P\n\t+ London—Fanshawe\n\t\t- F/P\n\t+ London West\n\t\t- F/P\n\t+ Elgin—Middlesex—London\n\t\t- F/P\n |\n| Transportation | * Municipal roads\n* Highway 401\n* Blackfriars Street Bridge\n* London Transit\n* London International Airport\n* London Station\n* Shift BRT\n |\n| Communities | * Byron\n* Huron Heights\n* Lambeth\n* Oakridge\n* Tempo\n* Uplands\n* Westminster\n* Westmount\n* Wortley Village\n |\n| Education | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Primary/secondary | * London District School Board\n* Catholic District School Board\n* Schools\n* Conseil scolaire Viamonde\n* H.B.

More than 600 people conduct basic and clinical research at the facility.\nWestern has four primary fields of research: life sciences and the human condition, culture analysis and values, the human and physical environments, and social trends, public policy, and economic activity.[100] In Research Infosource's 2018 ranking of Canadian research universities, Western was ranked 10th; with a sponsored research income (external funding) of $249.669 million in 2017.[101] In 2017, members of Western's faculty averaged a sponsored research income of $166,100, while graduate students averaged a sponsored research income $41,600.[101] The federal government is the largest source of funding providing 46 percent of Western's research budget, primarily through grants. Private corporations contribute 10 per cent of Western's research budget.[102]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe University of Western Ontario offers a student exchange program to study abroad with several other partner institutions. Almost four hundred students come to Western each year as exchange students from all over the world, with even more students coming to Western as international undergraduate or exchange students. The Western International Exchange Program offers its students the opportunity to study at more than 85 different institutions in 25 countries.[157]\n\n\n\n### Sexual violence[edit]\n\n\nIn 2014, Stanley Dobrowolski, a former staff psychiatrist for Western students, was convicted of sexual crimes against his patients. He pleaded guilty to 18 charges (16 of sexual assault, one voyeurism, and one for disobeying court orders) and was sentenced to four years in prison.[158] Dobrowolski had been a psychiatrist at Western until 1995. The university issued an apology for Dobrowolski's actions on 16 March 2016.[159]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nResearch regarding the human brain has also become a major focus at the university. The Brain and Mind Institute focuses on research in cognitive neuroscience at Western.[105] In 2011, the Institute discovered the blind may perform echolocation by using the visual cortex of the brain.[106] Another 2011 study at Western suggested people who are deaf from birth may be able to reassign the area of their brain used for hearing to boost their sight.[107] Western also is home to the Institute for Earth and Space Exploration, the first dedicated space institute providing a planetary science degree in Canada. The institute plays a key role in cutting edge multidisciplinary research on planetary bodies including real time mission operations for spacecraft and telescopes orbiting solar system bodies.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Land, Building Area, and Space 2016–17\" (PDF).

The university's legal name, however, remains \"The University of Western Ontario\" and is used on transcripts and diplomas.[24]\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Western Ontario is in the city of London, Ontario, in the southwestern end of the Quebec City–Windsor Corridor. Most of the campus is surrounded by residential neighbourhoods, with the Thames River bisecting the campus' eastern portion. Western Road is the university's major transportation artery, travelling north to south. The central campus, which includes most of the university's student residences and teaching facilities is approximately 170.8 hectares (422 acres).[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n158. **^** \"Former doctor Stanley Dobrowolski, sentenced for sex crimes, denied parole because he's too great a public risk\". *lfpress*.

The committee's mandate includes incorporating sustainability into the academic programming, engaging in research across the disciplines into issues of environmental sustainability, using ecological landscaping methods and preserving green space and building and renovating facilities in accordance with energy efficiency and sustainability principles[56] Along with the other members of the Council of Ontario Universities, Western had signed a pledge in 2009 known as *Ontario Universities Committed to a Greener World*, with the objective of transforming its campus into a model of environmental responsibility.[57] Western is also a signatory of the Talloires Declaration, a sustainability declaration created for presidents of higher education.[58] The university campus received a B− grade from the Sustainable Endowments Institute on its College Sustainability Report Card for 2011.[59]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWestern's research performance has been noted several bibliometric university rankings, which uses citation analysis to evaluates the impact a university has on academic publications. In 2019, the Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities ranked Western 197th in the world, and ninth in Canada,[103] whereas the University Ranking by Academic Performance 2018–19 rankings placed the university 187th in the world, and ninth in Canada.[104]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWestern also operates two art galleries, the Artlab Gallery, and the McIntosh Gallery. Located in the John Labatt Visual Arts Centre, the Artlab Gallery showcases approximately 14 projects per year, exploring conceptual and experimental production through a wide range of media. The Artlab Gallery also aims to assist in the research and practices of students and faculty members.[33] The McIntosh Gallery is a university-based, public art gallery, opened since 1942. The gallery is a presentation and dissemination centre for the university, as well as the London community, showcasing advanced practices and research in art history and contemporary visual art.[34] The gallery is the oldest university art gallery in the province of Ontario, initially opened as an exhibition of paintings by war artists from the National Gallery of Canada.[35] 683 works of the Gallery's collection were put on display throughout the university's main campus through the Gallery's ArtShare program in 2014.[36]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*The Gazette* has spawned several other publications in its history. One was *Occidentalia*, which had its roots in special convocation issues of the *Gazette* which included pictures of the graduating class.[152] \"Oxy\" as it was known became the university's year book and it provided \"an interesting record of the year's activities in all Faculties and Schools.\"[149] The paper is owned and published by the University Students' Council (USC). The paper has editorial autonomy from the USC.[147] The publications committee consists of mainly professional journalists who advise the full-time staff on editorial decisions and financial management of the paper, as well as offer an intermediary between the sometimes contentious relationship between the student politicians who are reported on by the *Gazette*.[153] The paper is one of the founding members of the National University Wire.[154] The Gazette has a long history of producing some of Canada's most well-known journalists. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMany former students have gained local and national prominence for serving in government, such as James Bartleman, who served as Lieutenant Governor of Ontario from 2002 to 2007, and Sheila Copps who served as Deputy Prime Minister of Canada.[170] Western's alumni also include a number of provincial premiers, including former premiers of Ontario John Robarts and David Peterson,[171] and the former premier of Alberta, Don Getty.[172] A number of graduates have also served prominent positions on the international level. Examples include Glenn Stevens,[173] the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia and Margaret Chan, the Director-General of the World Health Organization.[174]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_T5gM231bTJjqTp2GZhcCtI9y","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

The position of chancellor is a four-year, non-renewable term.[69] The university's current chancellor is Kelly Meighen, who was appointed to the position on 1 July 2023.[70]\n\n\n\n### Affiliated institutions[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1923, the university was renamed as The University of Western Ontario.[1][11] The first two buildings constructed by architect John Moore and Co. at the new site were the Arts Building (now University College) and the Natural Science Building (now the Physics and Astronomy Building).[18] Classes on the university's present site began in 1924.[19] The University College tower, one of the university's most distinctive features, was named the Middlesex Memorial Tower in honour of the men from Middlesex County who fought in World War I.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nUniversity College in June 1924\n![](image)\nUniversity College in October 2018\nCompleted in 1924, University College is one of the earliest university buildings built on the present campus\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the early 20th century, a number of institution became affiliated colleges of Western. In 1919, Brescia College was established as a Roman Catholic affiliate of Western, while Assumption College entered an affiliation agreement with the university.[12][20] Other institutions that became affiliated colleges of Western includes the Waterloo College of Arts in 1925, St. Peter's College in 1939, and King's College in 1945.[12] Waterloo College of Arts remained affiliated with Western until 1960, when the institution was reorganized into Wilfrid Laurier University; while Assumption College remained affiliated with Western until 1964, when it was reorganized into the University of Windsor.[12][20][21] Brescia, Huron, and King's remain affiliated with Western.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n78. **^** \"Affiliated University Colleges\".

Many of the university's earliest buildings used Collegiate Gothic designs, a characteristic confirmed in Western's master building plan in 1934.[26] As the campus expanded in the late 1960s, the university abandoned earlier commitments to Collegiate Gothic designs in favour of brutalist and modernist architectural designs.[26] In 2000, planning for Western's central campus was re-conceptualized, with the core devoted for only academic buildings. The plan saw University College Hill as the focal point, linking the lower portion of the campus with the South Valley[26] The 2006 campus master plan called for the protection and renewed emphasis on Western's Collegiate Gothic buildings.[26] The university's boiler room/power plant is the oldest building on the university's central campus, opening in 1922.[27] The oldest academic buildings within the central campus is University College and the Physics and Astronomy Building. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn September 2021, several students were alleged to have been sexually assaulted during Western's orientation week.

The resulting incidents has resulted in some criticism against the university for failing to protect female students from rape culture.[160] These events took place during a period known as the \"Red Zone.\" This is the period encompassing the first eight weeks of the university school year in which 50% of sexual-assaults take place.[161] In the same week, a first-year Western student was killed near the university; a suspect was later charged with manslaughter in connection with the incident.[162]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of University of Western Ontario people\n\n* ![John Robarts, 17th Premier of Ontario](image)\n\nJohn Robarts, 17th Premier of Ontario\n* ![Sir Frederick Banting, awarded the Nobel Prize for the first use of insulin on humans](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| University rankings |\n| --- |\n| Global rankings |\n| *ARWU* World[92] | 201–300 |\n| *QS* World[93] | 172 |\n| *QS* Employability[94] | 43 |\n| *Times* World[95] | 201–250 |\n| *U.S News & World Report* Global[96] | 300 |\n| Canadian rankings |\n| *ARWU* National[92] | 9–12 |\n| *QS* National[93] | 8 |\n| *Times* National[95] | 8–10 |\n| *U.S News & World Report* National[96] | 10 |\n| *Maclean's* Medical/Doctoral[97] | 11 |\n| *Maclean's* Reputation[98] | 13 |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUniversities in Canada\n |\n| --- |\n| Alberta | * Alberta\n* Arts\n* Athabasca\n* Calgary\n* Lethbridge\n* MacEwan\n* Mount Royal\n |\n| British Columbia | * British Columbia\n* Canada West\n* Capilano\n* Emily Carr\n* Fraser Valley\n* Kwantlen Polytechnic\n* Northern British Columbia\n* Royal Roads\n* Simon Fraser\n* Thompson Rivers\n* Trinity Western\n* Vancouver Island\n* Victoria\n |\n| Manitoba | * Brandon\n* Canadian Mennonite\n* Manitoba\n* Saint-Boniface\n* Winnipeg\n |\n| Newfoundland and Labrador | * Memorial\n |\n| New Brunswick | * Crandall\n* Fredericton\n* Moncton\n* Mount Allison\n* New Brunswick\n* St. Stephen's\n* St. Thomas\n* Yorkville\n |\n| Nova Scotia | * Acadia\n* AST\n* Cape Breton\n* Dalhousie\n* King's\n* Mount Saint Vincent\n* NSCAD\n* Saint Francis Xavier\n* Saint Mary's\n* Sainte-Anne\n |\n| Ontario | * Algoma\n* Brock\n* Carleton\n* Guelph\n* Hearst\n* Lakehead\n* Laurentian\n* Laurier\n* McMaster\n* Nipissing\n* NOSM\n* OCAD U\n* Ontario Tech\n* Ottawa\n* Queen's\n* RMC\n* Sudbury\n* TMU\n* Toronto\n* Trent\n* UOF\n* Waterloo\n* Western\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe University of Western Ontario| ![](image)Coat of arms\n |\n| Latin: *Universitas Occidentis Ontariensis* |\n| Other name\n | Western University |\n| Former names\n | The Western University of London, Ontario[1] |\n| Motto | *Veritas et Utilitas* (Latin) |\n| Motto in English\n | Truth and usefulness |\n| Type | Public |\n| Established | 7 March 1878; 146 years ago (1878-03-07)[2] |\n| Academic affiliations\n | ACU, CARL, COU, CUSID, Fields Institute, Universities Canada, U15 |\n| Endowment | CA$1.14 billion (2023)[3] |\n| Budget | CA$901.5 million[4] |\n| Chancellor | Kelly Meighen |\n| President | Alan Shepard |\n| Provost | Florentine Strzelczyk |\n| Academic staff\n | 1,391[5] |\n| Undergraduates | 33,638[6] |\n| Postgraduates | 6,597[7] |\n| Location | London, Ontario, Canada[a]\n43°00′30″N 81°16′21″W﻿ / ﻿43.00833°N 81.27250°W﻿ / 43.00833; -81.27250 |\n| Campus | Urban, 455 hectares (1,120 acres)[8] |\n| Colours | Purple and white[9]    |\n| Nickname | Mustangs |\n| Sporting affiliations\n | U Sports, OUA |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| People | * List of University of Western Ontario people\n\t+ List of King's University College people\n |\n| * **Founded**: 1878\n* **Students**: 30,235\n* **Endowment**: C$746.5 million\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nLondon, Ontario\n |\n| --- |\n| Government | * City Council\n* Mayors\n* 2022 municipal election\n* Federal/provincial electoral ridings\n\t+ London North Centre\n\t\t- F/P\n\t+ London—Fanshawe\n\t\t- F/P\n\t+ London West\n\t\t- F/P\n\t+ Elgin—Middlesex—London\n\t\t- F/P\n |\n| Transportation | * Municipal roads\n* Highway 401\n* Blackfriars Street Bridge\n* London Transit\n* London International Airport\n* London Station\n* Shift BRT\n |\n| Communities | * Byron\n* Huron Heights\n* Lambeth\n* Oakridge\n* Tempo\n* Uplands\n* Westminster\n* Westmount\n* Wortley Village\n |\n| Education | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Primary/secondary | * London District School Board\n* Catholic District School Board\n* Schools\n* Conseil scolaire Viamonde\n* H.B.

More than 600 people conduct basic and clinical research at the facility.\nWestern has four primary fields of research: life sciences and the human condition, culture analysis and values, the human and physical environments, and social trends, public policy, and economic activity.[100] In Research Infosource's 2018 ranking of Canadian research universities, Western was ranked 10th; with a sponsored research income (external funding) of $249.669 million in 2017.[101] In 2017, members of Western's faculty averaged a sponsored research income of $166,100, while graduate students averaged a sponsored research income $41,600.[101] The federal government is the largest source of funding providing 46 percent of Western's research budget, primarily through grants. Private corporations contribute 10 per cent of Western's research budget.[102]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe University of Western Ontario offers a student exchange program to study abroad with several other partner institutions. Almost four hundred students come to Western each year as exchange students from all over the world, with even more students coming to Western as international undergraduate or exchange students. The Western International Exchange Program offers its students the opportunity to study at more than 85 different institutions in 25 countries.[157]\n\n\n\n### Sexual violence[edit]\n\n\nIn 2014, Stanley Dobrowolski, a former staff psychiatrist for Western students, was convicted of sexual crimes against his patients. He pleaded guilty to 18 charges (16 of sexual assault, one voyeurism, and one for disobeying court orders) and was sentenced to four years in prison.[158] Dobrowolski had been a psychiatrist at Western until 1995. The university issued an apology for Dobrowolski's actions on 16 March 2016.[159]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nResearch regarding the human brain has also become a major focus at the university. The Brain and Mind Institute focuses on research in cognitive neuroscience at Western.[105] In 2011, the Institute discovered the blind may perform echolocation by using the visual cortex of the brain.[106] Another 2011 study at Western suggested people who are deaf from birth may be able to reassign the area of their brain used for hearing to boost their sight.[107] Western also is home to the Institute for Earth and Space Exploration, the first dedicated space institute providing a planetary science degree in Canada. The institute plays a key role in cutting edge multidisciplinary research on planetary bodies including real time mission operations for spacecraft and telescopes orbiting solar system bodies.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Land, Building Area, and Space 2016–17\" (PDF).

Located in the John Labatt Visual Arts Centre, the Artlab Gallery showcases approximately 14 projects per year, exploring conceptual and experimental production through a wide range of media. The Artlab Gallery also aims to assist in the research and practices of students and faculty members.[33] The McIntosh Gallery is a university-based, public art gallery, opened since 1942. The gallery is a presentation and dissemination centre for the university, as well as the London community, showcasing advanced practices and research in art history and contemporary visual art.[34] The gallery is the oldest university art gallery in the province of Ontario, initially opened as an exhibition of paintings by war artists from the National Gallery of Canada.[35] 683 works of the Gallery's collection were put on display throughout the university's main campus through the Gallery's ArtShare program in 2014.[36]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*The Gazette* has spawned several other publications in its history. One was *Occidentalia*, which had its roots in special convocation issues of the *Gazette* which included pictures of the graduating class.[152] \"Oxy\" as it was known became the university's year book and it provided \"an interesting record of the year's activities in all Faculties and Schools.\"[149] The paper is owned and published by the University Students' Council (USC). The paper has editorial autonomy from the USC.[147] The publications committee consists of mainly professional journalists who advise the full-time staff on editorial decisions and financial management of the paper, as well as offer an intermediary between the sometimes contentious relationship between the student politicians who are reported on by the *Gazette*.[153] The paper is one of the founding members of the National University Wire.[154] The Gazette has a long history of producing some of Canada's most well-known journalists. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMany former students have gained local and national prominence for serving in government, such as James Bartleman, who served as Lieutenant Governor of Ontario from 2002 to 2007, and Sheila Copps who served as Deputy Prime Minister of Canada.[170] Western's alumni also include a number of provincial premiers, including former premiers of Ontario John Robarts and David Peterson,[171] and the former premier of Alberta, Don Getty.[172] A number of graduates have also served prominent positions on the international level.
