It spent five weeks at number one on the weekly chart in 2022, and spent 91 weeks on the chart overall, becoming the longest-charting song in the Hot 100's 64-year history.[1]\nThe *Billboard* Hot 100 is a chart that ranks the best-performing singles of the United States. Its data, published by *Billboard* magazine and compiled by Nielsen SoundScan, is based collectively on each single's weekly physical and digital sales, as well as airplay and streaming.

For 2022, the list was published on December 1, calculated with data from November 20, 2021 to November 12, 2022.[1] At the number-one position was Glass Animals' \"Heat Waves\", which spent 5 weeks on top of the Billboard Hot 100. It accumulated a total of 91 weeks on the chart, which is the longest-charting song in the 64-year history of the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n\nThe 2022 Billboard Hot 100 Year-End list is also notable for being one of five Billboard Year-End lists that featured 14 songs that appeared in the previous year (in this case 2021's) repeat onto this list.

Both songs, along with six other original songs from the film, were written by Lin-Manuel Miranda *(pictured)*.\n![](image)After being featured in the fourth season of the Netflix show *Stranger

It was released through Grade A Productions and Columbia Records on 9 July 2021, as the lead single (sixth overall) from Laroi's reloaded mixtape, *F\\*ck Love 3: Over You*. Laroi and Bieber wrote the song with Haan, FnZ members Finatik & Zac, and producers Cashmere Cat, Charlie Puth, Omer Fedi, and Blake Slatkin. The song marks the second collaboration between the two artists, following Bieber's song, \"Unstable\", a track from his sixth studio album, *Justice* (2021).\n\n\n\"Stay\" reached number one on the *Billboard* Hot 100, becoming Laroi's first chart-topping single and Bieber's eighth, and additionally topped the *Billboard* Global 200. Furthermore, it reached number one in 21 other countries, including their respective natives Australia and Canada, along with Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, South Korea, and Sweden. It also peaked within the top ten in 18 other countries. At the 2021 ARIA Music Awards, the song won the ARIA Award for Best Pop Release, which resulted in Laroi and Bieber both winning the ARIA Award for Best Artist.[1] At the APRA Music Awards of 2022, the song won the award for Song of the Year.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nOn 20 September 2020, Laroi shared a snippet of the song on an Instagram live stream, followed by a longer snippet in better quality that was previewed on a live stream from Rolling Loud on 29 October 2020. Bieber's contribution to the song was revealed on 31 May 2021. The song leaked in full on a Discord server on 2 June 2021.[3]\n\n\n\"Stay\" marks Laroi's first major single release as a lead artist in 2021 and Bieber's first major single as a lead artist since the release of his second extended play, *Freedom*, which was released in April 2021. On 3 June 2021, Scooter Braun, who has been Bieber's manager from the start of his career, also became Laroi's manager, until Laroi left and joined Adam Leber at Rebel Management on 27 September 2021.[4]\n\n\nLaroi had the song for about a year before its release. He created the song while spending time with producers Charlie Puth, Omer Fedi, and Blake Slatkin at Slatkin's house. Puth played the melody of the song on the keyboard, but Laroi ended up liking it and wanted to get it in production software Pro Tools to use it to create a song. He felt that \"it was probably the most organic way of making a song I've ever done – ever\". Laroi thought Bieber \"would sound perfect\", so he went to the studio at which Bieber records; they finished recording the song, but Bieber was hesitant about whether his vocals sounded good or not.[5]\n\n\n\n## Composition and lyrics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\"Stay\"\n\n\nA short 30-second audio sample of \"Stay\", where the song reaches its climax as Laroi and Bieber's voices join together in the last chorus.\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file? See media help.*\n\n\"Stay\" is a fast-paced pop rap, pop rock, and synth-pop song.[6][7][8][9] It is set in the key of D♭ major and incorporates piano keys, heavy drums, and \"splattering\" synths.[6][9][10] The upward-darting keyboard riff, made on a Roland Juno-60 synthesizer owned by Slatkin, serves as the song's spine and eventually becomes the chorus melody.[11][12] Over a repeated melodic cell, Laroi and Bieber switch between head voice and chest voice on a minor sixth.[13] Jon Caramanica of *The New York Times* described the track as a \"hyper-slick\" hybridization of new wave and pop-punk.[14] Some critics found similarities between it and the music from Bieber's sixth studio album, *Justice* (2021). Justin Curto from *Vulture* compared the song's sound to *Justice* single \"Hold On\" and album tracks \"Die for You\" and \"Somebody\".[15][16] *Stereogum*'s Chris DeVille characterised it as \"[p]ost-SoundCloud pop-rap as effervescent *Justice*-style '80s pop\".[17]\n\n\nThe \"heartbreak-fueled\" lyrics to \"Stay\" enforce Laroi's toxic behaviour as he sets up a story about a troubled relationship where he is at fault.[18][19] In the chorus, he sings about his broken promises before begging for his partner to stay with him: \"I do the same thing I told you that I never would / I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could.\"[13][19][20] Robert Rowat of CBC Music interpreted the lines as \"an admission of weakness, if not a promise to be better\".[13] Bieber's verse echoes similar sentiments as he belts out lyrics about being unable to live without his loved one: \"When I'm away from you, I miss your touch / You're the reason I believe in love.\"[9][20][21] The song reaches its climax as Laroi and Bieber's voices join in the last chorus.[22]\n\n\n\n## Release and promotion[edit]\n\n\nOn 16 June 2021, Laroi and Bieber hinted at another collaboration. Leading up to its release, the two artists both teased the song multiple times on their respective social media accounts by posting snippets and teasing the lyrics.[23][24] Laroi also had previously stated on social media that Ron Perry, the label boss of Columbia Records would not release the song, to which Laroi asked his fans to repeatedly spam Perry on Instagram, which would hopefully change his mind into releasing it.[25][26] Laroi posted a picture of him at a basketball game on Instagram on 27 June 2021, holding a piece of paper that wrote the song title and the then-questionable release date, to which Puth teased his involvement of the song by commenting \"Yessssssssss\".[27] Three days later, Laroi shared a pre-order link in order to reveal the cover art, which would be posted the following day.[28]\n\n\n\n## Critical reception[edit]\n\n\nThe song has received generally positive reviews. Caramanica found \"Stay\" to be \"[b]racingly effective\", considering it a more effective pairing of Laroi and Bieber than their previous collaboration on \"Unstable\" from the latter's sixth studio album, *Justice*.[14] Tyler Jenke from *Rolling Stone Australia* wrote that \"the slick new tune\" is \"undoubtedly one that lives up [to] the hype\".[29] Jordan Rose of *Complex* believed that the track has Laroi and Bieber \"leaning into their strengths\".[30] Alex Zidel from *HotNewHipHop* felt that the song is \"every bit as infectious as [one] would expect\" and thought of it to be \"a solid pop offering for the summer\".[18] Jason Lipshutz of *Billboard* opined that the song \"sounds like it should push [Laroi] to a new level\" of stardom.[31] *Uproxx* contributing writer Carolyn Droke stated that the \"buoyant track['s]\" combination of \"a euphoric chorus and a driving beat\" will make it \"the next song of the summer\".[32] Rowat commended Laroi and Bieber's partnership as \"one of the year's best surprises\" and said that the song \"capitalizes on both singers' skills as falsettists\".[13] DeVille described the song as \"maniacally catchy\" and thought it musically feels like Laroi \"blasting off into a new frontier of crossover success\".[11] Curto called the track \"a high-energy, synth-filled pop banger\".[16] However, he later criticised the song for being \"some of Laroi's most anonymous work yet\" and concluded that \"it could just as easily be a hit for the Weeknd or Post Malone\".[15]\n\n\n\n## Accolades[edit]\n\n\n\n\nAwards and nominations for \"Stay\"\n| Year\n | Organization\n | Award\n | Result\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2021\n | MTV Video Music Awards | Song of Summer | Nominated\n | [33] |\n| ARIA Music Awards | Best Artist | Won\n | [34] |\n| Best Pop Release | Won\n |\n| 2022\n | Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards | Favorite Music Collaboration\n | Won\n | [35] |\n| APRA Music Awards | Song of the Year\n | Won\n | [36] |\n| *Billboard* Music Awards | Top Hot 100 Song | Won\n | [37] |\n| Top Streaming Song | Won\n |\n| Top Radio Song | Nominated\n |\n| Top Collaboration | Won\n |\n| Top *Billboard* Global 200 Song\n | Won\n |\n| Top *Billboard* Global (Excl.

Exactly one week later, Bieber invited Laroi to perform the song at the 2021 MTV Video Music Awards from the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York, for his two-song set that also included his

pianist.[106] On 24 November, Laroi closed out the 2021 ARIA Music Awards with a punk-inspired rendition of the song backed by a full band in front of a small club audience.[107][108] On 11 December,
