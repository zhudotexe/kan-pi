Pritzker and his wife Cindy, the award is funded by the Pritzker family and sponsored by the Hyatt Foundation. It is considered to be one of the world's premier architecture prizes, and is often referred to as the Nobel Prize of architecture.[2][3][4][5]\n\n\nThe Pritzker Architecture Prize claims to be awarded \"irrespective of nationality, race, creed, or ideology\".[6] The recipients receive US$100,000, a citation certificate, and, since 1987, a bronze medallion.[1] The designs on the medal are inspired by the work of architect Louis Sullivan, while the Latin inspired inscription on the reverse of the medallion—*firmitas, utilitas, venustas* (English: firmness, commodity and delight)—is from Ancient Roman architect Vitruvius. Before 1987, a limited edition Henry Moore sculpture accompanied the monetary prize.[1]\n\n\nThe Executive Director of the prize, Manuela Lucá-Dazio,[7] solicits nominations from a range of people, including past Laureates, academics, critics and others \"with expertise and interest in the field of architecture.\" Lucá-Dazio explains the mission of Pritzker Prize, to acknowledge a living architect or architects for a body of built work that has produced a consistent and significant contribution to humanity and to the built environment through the art of architecture.[8]\n\n\nAny licensed architect can also make a personal application for the prize before November 1 every year. (In 1988 Gordon Bunshaft nominated himself for the award and eventually won it.)[9] The jury, consisting of five to nine \"experts ... recognized professionals in their own fields of architecture, business, education, publishing, and culture\", deliberates and early in the following year announce the winner.[6] The prize Chair is the 2016 Pritzker laureate Alejandro Aravena; earlier chairs were J. Carter Brown (1979–2002), the Lord Rothschild (2003–2004), the Lord Palumbo (2005–2015), Glenn Murcutt (2016–2018) and Stephen Breyer (2019–2020).[10]\n\n\n\n\n## Laureates[edit]\n\n\nInaugural winner Philip Johnson was cited \"for 50 years of imagination and vitality embodied in a myriad of museums, theaters, libraries, houses, gardens and corporate structures\".[11] The 2004 laureate Zaha Hadid was the first female prize winner.[12] Ryue Nishizawa became the youngest winner in 2010 at age 44.[13] Partners in architecture (in 2001, Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron, in 2010, Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa, in 2020, Yvonne Farrell and Shelley McNamara, and in 2021, Anne Lacaton and Jean-Philippe Vassal) have shared the award.[14] In 1988, Gordon Bunshaft and Oscar Niemeyer were both separately honored with the award.[15] The 2017 winners, architects Rafael Aranda, Carme Pigem, and Ramón Vilalta were the first group of three to share the prize.[16][17]\n\n\n\n\n\nPritzker

Pritzker and his wife Cindy, the award is funded by the Pritzker family and sponsored by the Hyatt Foundation. It is considered to be one of the world's premier architecture prizes, and is often referred to as the Nobel Prize of architecture.[2][3][4][5]\n\n\nThe Pritzker Architecture Prize claims to be awarded \"irrespective of nationality, race, creed, or ideology\".[6] The recipients receive US$100,000, a citation certificate, and, since 1987, a bronze medallion.[1] The designs on the medal are inspired by the work of architect Louis Sullivan, while the Latin inspired inscription on the reverse of the medallion—*firmitas, utilitas, venustas* (English: firmness, commodity and delight)—is from Ancient Roman architect Vitruvius. Before 1987, a limited edition Henry Moore sculpture accompanied the monetary prize.[1]\n\n\nThe Executive Director of the prize, Manuela Lucá-Dazio,[7] solicits nominations from a range of people, including past Laureates, academics, critics and others \"with expertise and interest in the field of architecture.\" Lucá-Dazio explains the mission of Pritzker Prize, to acknowledge a living architect or architects for a body of built work that has produced a consistent and significant contribution to humanity and to the built environment through the art of architecture.[8]\n\n\nAny licensed architect can also make a personal application for the prize before November 1 every year. (In 1988 Gordon Bunshaft nominated himself for the award and eventually won it.)[9] The jury, consisting of five to nine \"experts ... recognized professionals in their own fields of architecture, business, education, publishing, and culture\", deliberates and early in the following year announce the winner.[6] The prize Chair is the 2016 Pritzker laureate Alejandro Aravena; earlier chairs were J. Carter Brown (1979–2002), the Lord Rothschild (2003–2004), the Lord Palumbo (2005–2015), Glenn Murcutt (2016–2018) and Stephen Breyer (2019–2020).[10]\n\n\n\n\n## Laureates[edit]\n\n\nInaugural winner Philip Johnson was cited \"for 50 years of imagination and vitality embodied in a myriad of museums, theaters, libraries, houses, gardens and corporate structures\".[11] The 2004 laureate Zaha Hadid was the first female prize winner.[12] Ryue Nishizawa became the youngest winner in 2010 at age 44.[13] Partners in architecture (in 2001, Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron, in 2010, Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa, in 2020, Yvonne Farrell and Shelley McNamara, and in 2021, Anne Lacaton and Jean-Philippe Vassal) have shared the award.[14] In 1988, Gordon Bunshaft and Oscar Niemeyer were both separately honored with the award.[15] The 2017 winners, architects Rafael Aranda, Carme Pigem, and Ramón Vilalta were the first group of three to share the prize.[16][17]\n\n\n\n\n\nPritzker

He established David Chipperfield Architects in 1985,[1] which grew into a global architectural practice with offices in London, Berlin, Milan, and Shanghai.\n\n\nIn 2023, he won the Pritzker Architecture Prize, considered to be the most prestigious award in architecture.[2][3] His major works include the River and Rowing Museum in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire (1989–1998); the Museum of Modern Literature in Marbach, Germany; the Des Moines Public Library, Iowa (2002–2006); the Neues Museum, Berlin (1997–2009); The Hepworth Wakefield gallery in Wakefield, West Yorkshire (2003–2011), the Saint Louis Art Museum, Missouri (2005–2013); and the Museo Jumex in Mexico City (2009–2013).\n\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nChipperfield was born in London in 1953, and graduated in 1976 from Kingston School of Art in London. He studied architecture at the Architectural Association (AA) in London, receiving his diploma in architecture in 1977. He worked in the offices of several notable architects, including Douglas Stephen, Norman Foster and Richard Rogers, before founding his firm, David Chipperfield Architects, in 1985.[4][5] As a young architect Chipperfield championed the historically attuned, place-specific work of continental architects such as Moneo, Snozzi and Siza through the 9H Gallery situated in the front room of his London office.[6]\n\n\nHe first established his reputation designing store interiors in London, Paris, Tokyo and New York. Among Chipperfield's early projects in England was a shop for Issey Miyake on London's Sloane Street.[7] His shops in Japan led to commissions to design for a private museum in Chiba prefecture (1987), design for a store for the automotive company Toyota in Kyoto (1989), and the headquarters of the Matsumoto Company in Okayama (1990). His firm opened an office in Tokyo in 1989.[8] His first commission to design an actual building was for a house for the fashion photographer Nick Knight in London in 1990.[9]\n\n\nHis first completed projects in London were the gallery of botany and the entrance hall for the Natural History Museum (1993), and restaurant Wagamama, both in London. His first major project in Britain was the River and Rowing Museum in Henley-on-Thames (1989) (see below). He also began to build in Germany, designing an office building in Düsseldorf (1994–1997). Other projects in the 1990s included the Circus Restaurant in London (1997) and the Joseph Menswear Shop (1997). The latter shop featured a curtain of glass six meters high around the two lower floors, and an austere modernist interior with dark grey sandstone floors and white walls.[8]\n\n\nIn 1997, he began one of his most important projects, the reconstruction and restoration of the Neues Museum in Berlin, which had been largely destroyed during World War II. After 2000, he won commissions for several other major museum projects in Germany, designed several major museum projects in Germany, including the Museum of Modern Literature in Marbach (2002–2006), and the Galerie Am Kupfergraben 10 in Berlin (2003–2007). In the same period, he designed and built, at rapid speed, a new headquarters for the America's Cup in Valencia, Spain (2005–2006), and an enormous judicial complex in Barcelona, Spain, which consolidated the offices previously contained in seventeen different buildings into nine new immense concrete blocks. He also constructed his first project in the United States, an extension of the Museum of ethnology and natural history in Anchorage, Alaska (2003–2009).[8]\n\n\nUntil 2011, most of his major projects were on the continent of Europe, but in 2011 he opened two notable museum projects in Britain, the Turner Contemporary (2006–11) in Margate, and The Hepworth Wakefield in Wakefield. In 2013, he opened the Jumex Museum in Mexico City, and the extension of the Saint Louis Art Museum in the United States. His most remote project was the Museum of Naga, on a site in the desert 170 kilometers northeast of Khartoum in Sudan, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. He designed a structure to preserve the remains of two ancient temples and an artesian well, dating to 300 B.C.-300 A.D. The building, built of the local stone, blends into reddish mountains around it.[10]\n\n\nIn 2015, Chipperfield won a competition to redesign the modern and contemporary art wing of the Metropolitan Museum in New York City. He also began his first ground-up building in New York City, the Bryant, a thirty-three storey hotel and condominium project next to Bryant Park in Manhattan.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 2017, he and his associates were engaged in a multitude of major projects around the world; including new flagship stores for Bally and Valentino, the reconstruction of the U.S. Embassy in London; One Pancras Square, an office and commercial complex behind King's Cross Station in London, a project for the Shanghai Expo tower in China, the new Nobel Center headquarters for the Nobel Prize in Stockholm,[11] a headquarters store for the online firm SSENSE in Montreal, the extension building for Kunsthaus Zurich,[12][13] the Haus der Kunst cultural center in Munich, the completion of the headquarters of Amorepacific in Seoul, Korea, and the Inagara Reien Project, a temple complex in Japan.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Major projects (1997–2010)[edit]\n\n\n### River and Rowing Museum, Henley-on-Thames, UK (1989–1997)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)River and Rowing Museum, Henley-on-Thames, UK, (1989–1997)\nThe River and Rowing Museum in Henley-on-Thames is devoted particularly to the sports of rowing; the town is home to the Annual Royal Regatta Olympic boating events in 1908 and 1948. The building is a blend of modernist and traditional forms and materials. It was inspired by the form of traditional boat sheds, as well as the traditional barns of Oxfordshire. The building occupies a space of 2,300 square metres, and is lifted above the ground on concrete pillars to avoid flooding. The exterior and parts of the interior are covered in planks of non-treated oak, matching the local rural architecture. The roofs and sunscreens are of stainless steel. The entrance has glass walls, and the galleries on the ground floor receive natural light through the roof.[14][15]\n\n\n\n### Des Moines Public Library, Des Moines, Iowa, US (2002–2006)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Des Moines Public Library, Des Moines, Iowa, US (2002–2006)\nThe Des Moines Public Library in Des Moines, Iowa, United States, covers an area of 110,000 square feet, and cost 32.3 million dollars to construct. The two-storey building has no front or back; instead it fans out into three wings. A glass tunnel allows passers-by to stroll through the library. Its most distinct feature is an exterior of glass panels with cooper mesh sandwiched between them; the mesh blocks eighty per cent of the sunlight, while allowing library patrons to gaze out at the park around the library. Chipperfield told Christopher Hall of *The New York Times*: \"The architecture is neutral and amorphous; almost no architecture at all, and the copper mesh is an attempt to veil the building as much as possible while allowing the outside in.\"[16][*full citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Museum of Modern Literature, Marbach, Germany (2002–2006)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Museum of Modern Literature in Marbach, Germany (2002–2006)\nThe Museum of Modern Literature is located in the town of Marbach, Germany, the birthplace of the poet Schiller. It benefits from a panoramic view of the Neckar River. It is located next to the beaux-arts building of the national Schiller Museum, built in 1903, and a more modern building of the German Literary Archives, from the 1970s. Visitors enter through a pavilion on the top floor and descend to the reading rooms below. While the lighting on the interior is entirely artificial, to protect the manuscripts, each level has a terrace overlooking the countryside. The facades of concrete, glass and wood are designed to give the impression of both solidity and modernity. The building was awarded the Stirling Prize in 2007.[17]\n\n\n\n### America's Cup Building (Veles e Vents), Valencia, Spain (2005–2006)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)America's Cup Building, Valencia, Spain, (2005–2006)\nChipperfield won a 2005 competition to construct a new headquarters for the America's Cup on the coast in Valencia, Spain. It was completed in just eleven months. The distinctive features of the 10,000 square metre building are three horizontal levels which overhang the terrace below by as much as fifteen metres, providing shade and an unobstructed view of the sea. The predominant colour inside and out is white, with panels of white metal on the ceilings, floors of white resin, and exterior trim of white-painted stainless steel. Exterior accents are provided by planks of wood.[18]\n\n\n\n### The Neues Museum, Berlin, Germany (1997–2009)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Neues Museum, Berlin, Germany (1997–2009)\nIn 1997, Chipperfield, along with Julian Harrap, won a competition for the reconstruction of the Neues Museum in Berlin, which had been severely damaged during World War II. His commission was to recreate the original volume of the museum, both by restoring original spaces and adding new spaces which would respect the historic structure of the building. Reinforced concrete was used for new galleries and the new central staircase, while recycled bricks were used in other spaces, particularly in the north wing and the south dome. In addition, some of the scars of the war on the building's walls were preserved, as an essential part of its history. As Chipperfield explained, the architects used these materials so that \"The new would reflect that which was lost, without imitating it.\" The building received the European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture in 2011.\n\n\nIn 2007, Chipperfield began a new project with the museum, to construct a new gallery, the James Simon Gallery, inspired by the colonnade of the old museum. The new section will house more than ten thousand objects from the archeological collections, including the famed bust of Queen Nefertiti. Scheduled for completion in 2017,[19][20][21] it was handed over to the museum in December 2018. The gallery opened to the public in 2019.[22]\n\n\n\n\n## Major projects (2011–present)[edit]\n\n\n### The Hepworth Wakefield gallery (2003–2011)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Hepworth Wakefield, Wakefield, UK (2003–2011)\nThe Hepworth Wakefield is a gallery devoted to the work of the sculptor Barbara Hepworth. It is composed of ten trapezoidal blocks; its upper-level galleries are lit by natural light from large windows in the pitched roofs.[23] Its windows have views of the river, historic waterfront and the city skyline. The building's façade is clad with self-compacting pigmented concrete made on site, the first of its kind in the United Kingdom. The architects selected the material to emphasise the gallery's sculptural appearance. Rowan Moore of *The Guardian*, in a 2011 review of Chipperfield's body of work, criticised the Hepworth Gallery's design, which he felt resembled \"a bunker\".[24]\n\n\n\n### City of Justice complex, Barcelona, Spain (2002–2011)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)City of Justice, Barcelona, Spain (2002–2011)\nThe City of Justice is a group of nine buildings with 241,500 metres of space, which consolidate courtrooms and offices which previously were scattered among seventeen different buildings. The courtrooms are on the ground floor, with offices above. Four of the buildings are connected together by a four-storey hallway. In addition to the judicial buildings, the complex, on the outskirts of Barcelona, includes a commercial centre and retail stores, and a block of low income residential housing. The facades of the buildings are all the same, made of concrete poured in place and lightly tinted in different shades. Chipperfield wrote that the purpose of the building was to \"break the image of justice as rigid and monolithic\",[25] but architectural critic Rowan Moore of *The Guardian* said it appeared \"uncomfortably prison-like.\"[24]\n\n\n\n### Saint Louis Art Museum expansion, Missouri, US (2005–2013)[edit]\n\n\nThe Saint Louis Art Museum project in Saint Louis, Missouri, United States (2005–2013) involved building a major new wing attached to a landmark of American architecture, the gallery built by beaux-arts architect Cass Gilbert in 1904. The new building by Chipperfield, with 9,000 square metres of space, harmonizes smoothly with the classic building; its ground level is the same as that of the main floor of the Gilbert Building. The walls are dark concrete were poured and polished in place, and the roof of concrete *caissons* is designed to modify the light entering the galleries.[26] To give the facade a distinctive look which also blended with the Gilbert building, Chipperfield speckled the dark grey polished concrete walls with fragments of the same kind of sandstone used in the Gilbert building. Edwin Heathcote of the *Financial Times* called it \"a gem of clarity and deceptive simplicity...It is a building designed to glow, inside and out, one that is more about the intangibility of light than about mass reinforced by shadow.\"[27][*full citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Turner Contemporary gallery, Margate, UK (2006–2013)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Turner Contemporary in Margate, Kent, UK (2006–2011)\nThe Turner Contemporary gallery is located beside a beach in Margate, on the north coast of Kent in south-east England. It is devoted to the works of painter J. M. W. Turner, his contemporaries, and those he influenced. It is close to the historic boarding house where the artist often stayed. The museum is composed of six identical glass galleries, referred to as \"Cristalins\", which are interconnected. The sunlight from the south is softened by a system of shutters over the ceiling, and the buildings are raised on pylons to avoid flooding from the neighbouring sea. The fritted[*clarification needed*] façades are designed to resist the dampness, corrosion and winds coming from the sea.[28]\n\n\n\n### Colección Jumex, Mexico City, Mexico (2009–2013)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Colección Jumex, Mexico City, Mexico (2009–2013)\nThe Colección Jumex in Mexico City displays one of the largest private collections of contemporary art in Mexico, neighbouring a theatre and another museum in a modern neighbourhood of the city. Zoning restrictions limited the space available, so Chipperfield put the museum administration, shop, and library in existing adjoining buildings, and devoted the Museum almost entirely to exhibit space. The galleries on the upper levels receive natural light from the skylights on the roof facing toward the west. The building is supported on fourteen columns, and is built of concrete covered with plaques of travertine limestone from Xalapa, in the state of Veracruz. The floor-to-ceiling windows on the lower floors have frames of stainless steel.[29]\n\n\n\n## Style and philosophy[edit]\n\n\nChipperfield's buildings cannot be described as following one particular style, although his work is sometimes seen as a reaction against the more flamboyant projects of Frank Gehry, Zaha Hadid or Santiago Calatrava. In 2005, he told Christopher Hall of *The New York Times*, \"I'm very interested in doing buildings that people are fond of, but with each project I also try to push the boundaries, to make something familiar but different. I'm not so interested in convincing the architectural community that I'm a genius.\"[30][*full citation needed*]\n\n\nIn a 2014 interview with Andy Butler in *Designboom*, Chipperfield declared: \"The one thing you can't do in architecture, at least in my opinion, is to limit your way of thinking to a style, or a material, you have to be responsive to the circumstances of a project.\" He declared that \"architecture could not be globalized\" because it varied depending upon the culture of a city. \"However contemporary we feel that we are, we still want to find different characteristics in different places. When we are building in a city we have a responsibility in a way to join in and to understand why buildings are as they are in that city. I find it very weak for an architect to disregard the history and culture of a city and say 'I have an international style.' There's absolutely no justification for that. It's the equivalent of having no variation in a cuisine, you may as well just place all the different types of food in a blender and consume it as a protein-rich shake.\"[31][*full citation needed*]\n\n\nRowan Moore, *The Guardian*'s architecture critic, described his work as \"serious, solid, not flamboyant or radical, but comfortable with the history and culture of its setting\". He observed that \"Chipperfield stresses less glamorous questions, such as, \"how is a building going to look five or ten years later?\" and \"deals in dignity, in gravitas, in memory and in art.\" He quotes Chipperfield on his work on the Neues Museum, a project that lasted twelve years. \"How you do things is profoundly important. The quality of the Neues Museum construction is extraordinary even by German standards, and people can smell the quality. The concept would not have been so convincing without it.\" He also noted that Chipperfield \"is much sought after for projects that help define cities' modern view of themselves, often in relation to a rich or fraught history.\"[24]\n\n\nChipperfield described the style of his recent The Bryant residential tower in New York City (2013–2018) as \"classical elegance in terms of its symmetries and simple grids and order.\" Describing the Bryant Park, Tim McKeough of *The New York Times* wrote \"In contrast with other big-name architects who wow with audacious forms and breathtaking structural feats, Mr. Chipperfield is best-known for buildings with a pared-down aesthetic purity.\" He noted that Chipperfield's signature on the building was the facade, composed of precast terrazzo panels with a mosaic of marble and sandstone chips, polished to a matte finish, to give the building a distinctive reflective colour.[32][*full citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Teaching[edit]\n\n\nChipperfield has taught architecture in Europe and the United States, and has lectured extensively, including as Professor of Architecture at the State Academy of Fine Arts Stuttgart from 1995 to 2001.[33] In addition, Chipperfield held the Mies van der Rohe Chair at the Escola Técnica in Barcelona, Spain, and the Norman R. Foster Professorship of Architectural Design at the Yale School of Architecture. He is a visiting professor at the University of the Arts London (formerly London Institute). He has been on the Board of Trustees of The Architecture Foundation and is currently a trustee of the Sir John Soane's Museum in London.[34]\n\n\n\n## Selected works[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section of a biography of a living person **does not include any references or sources**.

He established David Chipperfield Architects in 1985,[1] which grew into a global architectural practice with offices in London, Berlin, Milan, and Shanghai.\n\n\nIn 2023, he won the Pritzker Architecture Prize, considered to be the most prestigious award in architecture.[2][3] His major works include the River and Rowing Museum in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire (1989–1998); the Museum of Modern Literature in Marbach, Germany; the Des Moines Public Library, Iowa (2002–2006); the Neues Museum, Berlin (1997–2009); The Hepworth Wakefield gallery in Wakefield, West Yorkshire (2003–2011), the Saint Louis Art Museum, Missouri (2005–2013); and the Museo Jumex in Mexico City (2009–2013).\n\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nChipperfield was born in London in 1953, and graduated in 1976 from Kingston School of Art in London. He studied architecture at the Architectural Association (AA) in London, receiving his diploma in architecture in 1977. He worked in the offices of several notable architects, including Douglas Stephen, Norman Foster and Richard Rogers, before founding his firm, David Chipperfield Architects, in 1985.[4][5] As a young architect Chipperfield championed the historically attuned, place-specific work of continental architects such as Moneo, Snozzi and Siza through the 9H Gallery situated in the front room of his London office.[6]\n\n\nHe first established his reputation designing store interiors in London, Paris, Tokyo and New York. Among Chipperfield's early projects in England was a shop for Issey Miyake on London's Sloane Street.[7] His shops in Japan led to commissions to design for a private museum in Chiba prefecture (1987), design for a store for the automotive company Toyota in Kyoto (1989), and the headquarters of the Matsumoto Company in Okayama (1990). His firm opened an office in Tokyo in 1989.[8] His first commission to design an actual building was for a house for the fashion photographer Nick Knight in London in 1990.[9]\n\n\nHis first completed projects in London were the gallery of botany and the entrance hall for the Natural History Museum (1993), and restaurant Wagamama, both in London. His first major project in Britain was the River and Rowing Museum in Henley-on-Thames (1989) (see below). He also began to build in Germany, designing an office building in Düsseldorf (1994–1997). Other projects in the 1990s included the Circus Restaurant in London (1997) and the Joseph Menswear Shop (1997). The latter shop featured a curtain of glass six meters high around the two lower floors, and an austere modernist interior with dark grey sandstone floors and white walls.[8]\n\n\nIn 1997, he began one of his most important projects, the reconstruction and restoration of the Neues Museum in Berlin, which had been largely destroyed during World War II. After 2000, he won commissions for several other major museum projects in Germany, designed several major museum projects in Germany, including the Museum of Modern Literature in Marbach (2002–2006), and the Galerie Am Kupfergraben 10 in Berlin (2003–2007). In the same period, he designed and built, at rapid speed, a new headquarters for the America's Cup in Valencia, Spain (2005–2006), and an enormous judicial complex in Barcelona, Spain, which consolidated the offices previously contained in seventeen different buildings into nine new immense concrete blocks. He also constructed his first project in the United States, an extension of the Museum of ethnology and natural history in Anchorage, Alaska (2003–2009).[8]\n\n\nUntil 2011, most of his major projects were on the continent of Europe, but in 2011 he opened two notable museum projects in Britain, the Turner Contemporary (2006–11) in Margate, and The Hepworth Wakefield in Wakefield. In 2013, he opened the Jumex Museum in Mexico City, and the extension of the Saint Louis Art Museum in the United States. His most remote project was the Museum of Naga, on a site in the desert 170 kilometers northeast of Khartoum in Sudan, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. He designed a structure to preserve the remains of two ancient temples and an artesian well, dating to 300 B.C.-300 A.D. The building, built of the local stone, blends into reddish mountains around it.[10]\n\n\nIn 2015, Chipperfield won a competition to redesign the modern and contemporary art wing of the Metropolitan Museum in New York City. He also began his first ground-up building in New York City, the Bryant, a thirty-three storey hotel and condominium project next to Bryant Park in Manhattan.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 2017, he and his associates were engaged in a multitude of major projects around the world; including new flagship stores for Bally and Valentino, the reconstruction of the U.S. Embassy in London; One Pancras Square, an office and commercial complex behind King's Cross Station in London, a project for the Shanghai Expo tower in China, the new Nobel Center headquarters for the Nobel Prize in Stockholm,[11] a headquarters store for the online firm SSENSE in Montreal, the extension building for Kunsthaus Zurich,[12][13] the Haus der Kunst cultural center in Munich, the completion of the headquarters of Amorepacific in Seoul, Korea, and the Inagara Reien Project, a temple complex in Japan.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Major projects (1997–2010)[edit]\n\n\n### River and Rowing Museum, Henley-on-Thames, UK (1989–1997)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)River and Rowing Museum, Henley-on-Thames, UK, (1989–1997)\nThe River and Rowing Museum in Henley-on-Thames is devoted particularly to the sports of rowing; the town is home to the Annual Royal Regatta Olympic boating events in 1908 and 1948. The building is a blend of modernist and traditional forms and materials. It was inspired by the form of traditional boat sheds, as well as the traditional barns of Oxfordshire. The building occupies a space of 2,300 square metres, and is lifted above the ground on concrete pillars to avoid flooding. The exterior and parts of the interior are covered in planks of non-treated oak, matching the local rural architecture. The roofs and sunscreens are of stainless steel. The entrance has glass walls, and the galleries on the ground floor receive natural light through the roof.[14][15]\n\n\n\n### Des Moines Public Library, Des Moines, Iowa, US (2002–2006)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Des Moines Public Library, Des Moines, Iowa, US (2002–2006)\nThe Des Moines Public Library in Des Moines, Iowa, United States, covers an area of 110,000 square feet, and cost 32.3 million dollars to construct. The two-storey building has no front or back; instead it fans out into three wings. A glass tunnel allows passers-by to stroll through the library. Its most distinct feature is an exterior of glass panels with cooper mesh sandwiched between them; the mesh blocks eighty per cent of the sunlight, while allowing library patrons to gaze out at the park around the library. Chipperfield told Christopher Hall of *The New York Times*: \"The architecture is neutral and amorphous; almost no architecture at all, and the copper mesh is an attempt to veil the building as much as possible while allowing the outside in.\"[16][*full citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Museum of Modern Literature, Marbach, Germany (2002–2006)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Museum of Modern Literature in Marbach, Germany (2002–2006)\nThe Museum of Modern Literature is located in the town of Marbach, Germany, the birthplace of the poet Schiller. It benefits from a panoramic view of the Neckar River. It is located next to the beaux-arts building of the national Schiller Museum, built in 1903, and a more modern building of the German Literary Archives, from the 1970s. Visitors enter through a pavilion on the top floor and descend to the reading rooms below. While the lighting on the interior is entirely artificial, to protect the manuscripts, each level has a terrace overlooking the countryside. The facades of concrete, glass and wood are designed to give the impression of both solidity and modernity. The building was awarded the Stirling Prize in 2007.[17]\n\n\n\n### America's Cup Building (Veles e Vents), Valencia, Spain (2005–2006)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)America's Cup Building, Valencia, Spain, (2005–2006)\nChipperfield won a 2005 competition to construct a new headquarters for the America's Cup on the coast in Valencia, Spain. It was completed in just eleven months. The distinctive features of the 10,000 square metre building are three horizontal levels which overhang the terrace below by as much as fifteen metres, providing shade and an unobstructed view of the sea. The predominant colour inside and out is white, with panels of white metal on the ceilings, floors of white resin, and exterior trim of white-painted stainless steel. Exterior accents are provided by planks of wood.[18]\n\n\n\n### The Neues Museum, Berlin, Germany (1997–2009)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Neues Museum, Berlin, Germany (1997–2009)\nIn 1997, Chipperfield, along with Julian Harrap, won a competition for the reconstruction of the Neues Museum in Berlin, which had been severely damaged during World War II. His commission was to recreate the original volume of the museum, both by restoring original spaces and adding new spaces which would respect the historic structure of the building. Reinforced concrete was used for new galleries and the new central staircase, while recycled bricks were used in other spaces, particularly in the north wing and the south dome. In addition, some of the scars of the war on the building's walls were preserved, as an essential part of its history. As Chipperfield explained, the architects used these materials so that \"The new would reflect that which was lost, without imitating it.\" The building received the European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture in 2011.\n\n\nIn 2007, Chipperfield began a new project with the museum, to construct a new gallery, the James Simon Gallery, inspired by the colonnade of the old museum. The new section will house more than ten thousand objects from the archeological collections, including the famed bust of Queen Nefertiti. Scheduled for completion in 2017,[19][20][21] it was handed over to the museum in December 2018. The gallery opened to the public in 2019.[22]\n\n\n\n\n## Major projects (2011–present)[edit]\n\n\n### The Hepworth Wakefield gallery (2003–2011)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Hepworth Wakefield, Wakefield, UK (2003–2011)\nThe Hepworth Wakefield is a gallery devoted to the work of the sculptor Barbara Hepworth. It is composed of ten trapezoidal blocks; its upper-level galleries are lit by natural light from large windows in the pitched roofs.[23] Its windows have views of the river, historic waterfront and the city skyline. The building's façade is clad with self-compacting pigmented concrete made on site, the first of its kind in the United Kingdom. The architects selected the material to emphasise the gallery's sculptural appearance. Rowan Moore of *The Guardian*, in a 2011 review of Chipperfield's body of work, criticised the Hepworth Gallery's design, which he felt resembled \"a bunker\".[24]\n\n\n\n### City of Justice complex, Barcelona, Spain (2002–2011)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)City of Justice, Barcelona, Spain (2002–2011)\nThe City of Justice is a group of nine buildings with 241,500 metres of space, which consolidate courtrooms and offices which previously were scattered among seventeen different buildings. The courtrooms are on the ground floor, with offices above. Four of the buildings are connected together by a four-storey hallway. In addition to the judicial buildings, the complex, on the outskirts of Barcelona, includes a commercial centre and retail stores, and a block of low income residential housing. The facades of the buildings are all the same, made of concrete poured in place and lightly tinted in different shades. Chipperfield wrote that the purpose of the building was to \"break the image of justice as rigid and monolithic\",[25] but architectural critic Rowan Moore of *The Guardian* said it appeared \"uncomfortably prison-like.\"[24]\n\n\n\n### Saint Louis Art Museum expansion, Missouri, US (2005–2013)[edit]\n\n\nThe Saint Louis Art Museum project in Saint Louis, Missouri, United States (2005–2013) involved building a major new wing attached to a landmark of American architecture, the gallery built by beaux-arts architect Cass Gilbert in 1904. The new building by Chipperfield, with 9,000 square metres of space, harmonizes smoothly with the classic building; its ground level is the same as that of the main floor of the Gilbert Building. The walls are dark concrete were poured and polished in place, and the roof of concrete *caissons* is designed to modify the light entering the galleries.[26] To give the facade a distinctive look which also blended with the Gilbert building, Chipperfield speckled the dark grey polished concrete walls with fragments of the same kind of sandstone used in the Gilbert building. Edwin Heathcote of the *Financial Times* called it \"a gem of clarity and deceptive simplicity...It is a building designed to glow, inside and out, one that is more about the intangibility of light than about mass reinforced by shadow.\"[27][*full citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Turner Contemporary gallery, Margate, UK (2006–2013)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Turner Contemporary in Margate, Kent, UK (2006–2011)\nThe Turner Contemporary gallery is located beside a beach in Margate, on the north coast of Kent in south-east England. It is devoted to the works of painter J. M. W. Turner, his contemporaries, and those he influenced. It is close to the historic boarding house where the artist often stayed. The museum is composed of six identical glass galleries, referred to as \"Cristalins\", which are interconnected. The sunlight from the south is softened by a system of shutters over the ceiling, and the buildings are raised on pylons to avoid flooding from the neighbouring sea. The fritted[*clarification needed*] façades are designed to resist the dampness, corrosion and winds coming from the sea.[28]\n\n\n\n### Colección Jumex, Mexico City, Mexico (2009–2013)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Colección Jumex, Mexico City, Mexico (2009–2013)\nThe Colección Jumex in Mexico City displays one of the largest private collections of contemporary art in Mexico, neighbouring a theatre and another museum in a modern neighbourhood of the city. Zoning restrictions limited the space available, so Chipperfield put the museum administration, shop, and library in existing adjoining buildings, and devoted the Museum almost entirely to exhibit space. The galleries on the upper levels receive natural light from the skylights on the roof facing toward the west. The building is supported on fourteen columns, and is built of concrete covered with plaques of travertine limestone from Xalapa, in the state of Veracruz. The floor-to-ceiling windows on the lower floors have frames of stainless steel.[29]\n\n\n\n## Style and philosophy[edit]\n\n\nChipperfield's buildings cannot be described as following one particular style, although his work is sometimes seen as a reaction against the more flamboyant projects of Frank Gehry, Zaha Hadid or Santiago Calatrava. In 2005, he told Christopher Hall of *The New York Times*, \"I'm very interested in doing buildings that people are fond of, but with each project I also try to push the boundaries, to make something familiar but different. I'm not so interested in convincing the architectural community that I'm a genius.\"[30][*full citation needed*]\n\n\nIn a 2014 interview with Andy Butler in *Designboom*, Chipperfield declared: \"The one thing you can't do in architecture, at least in my opinion, is to limit your way of thinking to a style, or a material, you have to be responsive to the circumstances of a project.\" He declared that \"architecture could not be globalized\" because it varied depending upon the culture of a city. \"However contemporary we feel that we are, we still want to find different characteristics in different places. When we are building in a city we have a responsibility in a way to join in and to understand why buildings are as they are in that city. I find it very weak for an architect to disregard the history and culture of a city and say 'I have an international style.' There's absolutely no justification for that. It's the equivalent of having no variation in a cuisine, you may as well just place all the different types of food in a blender and consume it as a protein-rich shake.\"[31][*full citation needed*]\n\n\nRowan Moore, *The Guardian*'s architecture critic, described his work as \"serious, solid, not flamboyant or radical, but comfortable with the history and culture of its setting\". He observed that \"Chipperfield stresses less glamorous questions, such as, \"how is a building going to look five or ten years later?\" and \"deals in dignity, in gravitas, in memory and in art.\" He quotes Chipperfield on his work on the Neues Museum, a project that lasted twelve years. \"How you do things is profoundly important. The quality of the Neues Museum construction is extraordinary even by German standards, and people can smell the quality. The concept would not have been so convincing without it.\" He also noted that Chipperfield \"is much sought after for projects that help define cities' modern view of themselves, often in relation to a rich or fraught history.\"[24]\n\n\nChipperfield described the style of his recent The Bryant residential tower in New York City (2013–2018) as \"classical elegance in terms of its symmetries and simple grids and order.\" Describing the Bryant Park, Tim McKeough of *The New York Times* wrote \"In contrast with other big-name architects who wow with audacious forms and breathtaking structural feats, Mr. Chipperfield is best-known for buildings with a pared-down aesthetic purity.\" He noted that Chipperfield's signature on the building was the facade, composed of precast terrazzo panels with a mosaic of marble and sandstone chips, polished to a matte finish, to give the building a distinctive reflective colour.[32][*full citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Teaching[edit]\n\n\nChipperfield has taught architecture in Europe and the United States, and has lectured extensively, including as Professor of Architecture at the State Academy of Fine Arts Stuttgart from 1995 to 2001.[33] In addition, Chipperfield held the Mies van der Rohe Chair at the Escola Técnica in Barcelona, Spain, and the Norman R. Foster Professorship of Architectural Design at the Yale School of Architecture. He is a visiting professor at the University of the Arts London (formerly London Institute). He has been on the Board of Trustees of The Architecture Foundation and is currently a trustee of the Sir John Soane's Museum in London.[34]\n\n\n\n## Selected works[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section of a biography of a living person **does not include any references or sources**.

Parallel to his studies, he established the Kéré Foundation (formerly Schulbausteine für Gando), and in 2005 he founded *Kéré Architecture*. His architectural practice has been recognized internationally with awards including the Aga Khan Award for Architecture (2004) for his first building, the Gando Primary School in Burkina Faso, and the Global Holcim Award for Sustainable Construction 2012 Gold.\n\n\nKéré has undertaken projects in various countries including Burkina Faso, Mali, Kenya, Uganda, Mozambique, Togo, Sudan, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, the US, and the UK.[4] In 2017 the Serpentine Galleries commissioned him to design the Serpentine Pavilion in London. He has held professorships at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, Yale School of Architecture and the Swiss Accademia di Architettura di Mendrisio. In 2017 he accepted the professorship for \"Architectural Design and Participation\" at the Technical University of Munich.\n\n\nIn 2022, he won the Pritzker Architecture Prize, the first person from Africa and the first Black person to do so.[2][5]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nKéré was born in the village of Gando, Burkina Faso. He was the first child in the village to be sent to school as his father, the village chief, wanted his eldest son to learn how to read and translate his letters. Since no school existed in Gando, Kéré had to leave his family when he was 7 years old to live with his uncle in the city. After finishing his education, he became a carpenter and received a scholarship from the Carl Duisberg Society to do an apprenticeship in Germany as a supervisor in development aid. After completing the apprenticeship, he went on to study architecture at the Technical University of Berlin, graduating in 2004.[4]\n\n\nDuring his studies he felt it was his duty to contribute to his family and to the community which had supported him, and to give the next generation the opportunity to follow in his footsteps. In 1998, with the help of his friends, Kéré set up the association Schulbausteine für Gando e.V. (now Kéré Foundation), which loosely translates as \"Building Blocks for Gando\", to fund the construction of a primary school for his village. His objective was to combine the knowledge he had gained in Europe, with traditional building methods from Burkina Faso. He completed his studies and built the first school in Gando as his diploma project in 2004, while also opening his own architectural office Kéré Architecture.[6][7][8][9][10][11]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nKéré is known for involving community in his projects and for his innovative use of vernacular materials and techniques.[12][11]\n\n\n\n### Teaching[edit]\n\n\nKéré has worked as a lecturer at the Technical University of Berlin. In spring 2011, he lectured at Virginia Tech, Washington University, and the University of Texas. The following summer he lectured at the University of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, and in autumn 2012 he was a visiting professor at Harvard. He also taught at the Accademia di Architettura di Mendrisio. Kéré accepted a newly created professorship for Architectural design and Participation at the Technical University of Munich in 2017. He was awarded a visiting professorship at the Yale School of Architecture. In 2021 Kéré took a position as guest professor at the Bauhaus University in Weimar, Germany.[13]\n\n\n\n### Architecture and design projects in Gando[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gando, Burkina Faso\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **may contain an excessive amount of intricate detail that may interest only a particular audience**.

The village, located south east of Ouagadougou, has approximately 3000 inhabitants who live in mud huts without access to running water or electricity. According to the UN Human Development Index in 2011, Burkina Faso is the 7th-least developed country in the world. Most residents are subsistence farmers, remaining dependent on the harsh climate which has restricted rainfall between October and June, and high daytime temperatures of 45 °C.\n\n\n\n#### Gando Primary School[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Primary School in Gando\nKéré's primary school, the first for Gando, was completed in 2001. Schools in Burkina Faso are routinely built out of concrete, an expensive and energy consumptive material to produce, ill-suited to the local climate, as the interior becomes intolerably hot. Kéré wanted to use locally available resources and chose to build with earth in the form of mud bricks. Kéré's innovative design consisted of a wide, raised tin roof to protect the walls from rain, and allow air to circulate underneath for building cooling. The finished building was cooler and more pleasant inside than the conventional concrete school buildings. He won the Aga Khan Award for Architecture for the design in 2004.[16]\n\n\nKéré drew preliminary building plans in the sand to communicate with villagers, many of whom were illiterate, and found they fully engaged with the project, with many generating their own suggestions for improvement. Kéré said, “Only those who are involved in the development process can appreciate the results achieved, develop them further, and protect them”.[17] The entire population of Gando took part in the construction of the school. Village members received on-site training in construction techniques. Neighboring villages, impressed by Gando's community organization and achievement, set out to build their own schools.[18]\n\n\n\n#### Gando Mango Tree Project[edit]\n\n\nKéré initiated a project of planting mango trees to better meet the communities' needs and address several major problems in the region including malnutrition. Kéré developed a strategy in which prior to planting the tree, a hole is filled with old bones and meat, and left for a few days. Over time, the bones and meat attract ants, which colonize the hole and eat the termites. This enables the trees to grow without needing any insecticide. For natural fertilizer, chickens are kept in the shade of the trees. Kéré then had residents place hand-made clay pots next to the trees, with drippers targeted directly to the roots, which gave the trees a small but constant supply of water. The clay pots prevent evaporation loss and only need to be filled once a week.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n#### Gando Secondary School[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Secondary school in Gando\nConstruction of a secondary school designed by Kéré began in May 2011. The new building complex was designed to accommodate approximately 1000 students. The layout is inspired by the traditional rural households in Burkina Faso: the classrooms are set out in a circular fashion forming a protected courtyard, shielding it from the dust and sand brought by the Harmattan winds. The structure is open on its west side, allowing a cool breeze to enter the area, an innovative air-cooling system using only natural ventilation. The school is surrounded by a bank of earth, on which trees are planted. The trees provide shade, and rainwater is gathered to provide them with water. Perforated pipes are laid underneath the earth banks, and gather moisture. Wind cools down as it blows through the pipes, and emerges in the classrooms through holes in the floor, providing a zero emissions under-floor cooling system. This design won the 2012 Global Holcim Award for Sustainable Construction Gold.[4]\n\n\nThe secondary school uses the same roof design as the primary school, with a wide corrugated iron roof raised above a clay ceiling. Air circulates between the ceiling and roof, heats up and rises, creating a suction current below. This causes the cool air from the under-floor pipes to rise, reducing room temperature by an estimated 6 – 8 °C. With simple yet effective methods such as these, the school requires little electricity both for construction and maintenance. In order to combat deforestation issues Burkina Faso faces, the secondary school used wood from eucalyptus trees for construction, and mango trees were planted in their place. The mango trees need less water, produce fruit and provide more shade than eucalyptus trees.\n\n\nAs with Kéré's other projects, the secondary school uses local manpower for construction. Specialists trained by Kéré supervise members of the local community, training them in the necessary building techniques. Rather than building the walls brick by brick, Kéré has devised a quicker way of pouring mud and a small quantity of cement into a mould. \n\n\n\n#### Atelier Gando[edit]\n\n\nDeveloped in 2014, the Atelier is a building which functions as a community center and on-site base for building projects. A group of students from the Accademia di Architettura di Mendrisio helped Kéré plan and build the first steps of the construction.[19]\n\n\n\n### Other architecture and design projects[edit]\n\n\n#### Dano Secondary School[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Secondary school in Dano, Burkina Faso\nThe secondary school project in Dano, Burkina Faso was inspired by Kéré's previous work in Gando. The excessive daytime heat was once again the major issue, but this time there were different local resources. Laterite stone, native to the region, was used as the main building material. The building was set at an east–west orientation which reduces direct solar radiation onto the walls, and the sharply protruding roof creates a lot of shade. The roof design with its system of natural ventilation allows the air to circulate between the mud brick ceiling and the raised tin roof. The building consists of three classrooms, a computer room and an office. There is also an amphitheatre designed for use during break times. Finished in 2007, the building work was largely done by people trained in the Gando school projects, giving them the opportunity to use and develop their skills, while also reducing construction costs.\n\n\n\n#### Centre for Earth Architecture, Mopti[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Centre for Earth Architecture in Mopti, Mali\nThe Aga Khan Trust for Culture has spent over 10 years renovating mosques in Northern Mali. Finished in 2010, the Centre for Earth Architecture in Mopti is part of this series of projects, following the restoration of the mosque and the construction of a new sewerage system. The centre is intended to be much more than an exhibition space: the building is the product of the same ancient building techniques used in the Great Mosques in Mopti, Timbuktu and Djenné. It demonstrates how a material that is a part of the area's heritage can be used in a modern context. The centre is made up of an exhibition hall, a community centre, public toilets and a restaurant, responding to the needs of the district management of Komoguel and visitors to the area, as well as the local community.\n\n\nFrom the top of the flood barrier, it can be seen that the building is aligned with the mosque. The building has a simple structure and its height corresponds to the neighbouring buildings without compromising the view of the mosque. When viewed from across the lake the centre manages to maintain a connection with the mosque but does not dominate the view.\n\n\nThe centre is divided into three different buildings which are connected by two roof surfaces. Clay for the building was brought from 5 km away, so that the red colour would contrast with the colour of the local buildings, which are all made using traditional mud construction. The rusty red colour of the laterite clay is due to its high iron oxide content. All the walls and barrel vaults in the centre are made out of BTC (compressed earth blocks) and are not plastered or painted. These are very well suited to the climatic conditions as they create a natural temperature buffer, making indoor temperatures much more comfortable. The overhanging roof blocks keep the walls cool and provide shaded outdoor spaces. The building is naturally ventilated through openings in the walls and vaults, therefore, mechanical air conditioning is not needed. Most vernacular buildings in Mopti have wooden ceilings filled with clay. Kéré used a new system in this building that involves no wood – BTC vaults. He wants to promote the use of clay but to be sparing in his use of wood, as deforestation is a huge environmental issue in Mali.\n\n\n\n#### Opera Village[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Opera Village Africa\n\n![](image)Construction of the Remdoogo Opera Village in Laongo, Burkina Faso\nThe Opera House for Africa project was initiated by German film and theatre director Christoph Schlingensief. Schlingensief brought Kéré on board to develop a housing prototype for people affected by flooding. The Remdoogo opera village was constructed on a 12-hectare site on a small rise in Laongo, one hour's drive from Ouagadougou and overlooking the West African landscape of the Sahel. A festival theatre, workshops, medical centre and guest houses were designed, as well as solar panels, a well, and a school for up to 500 children and teenagers with music and film classes. The stage and auditorium were designed and constructed in Germany and later transferred to the opera village. Kéré used Burkinabe fabrics to cover seat rows and interior walls.\n\n\nSimple basic modules, which vary in quality and function depending on the equipment they house, comprise the entire village. Local people were employed to build the modules, and local materials such as clay, laterite, cement bricks, gum wood and loam rendering were used for construction. For reinforcing elements such as beams, columns, ring beams, and foundations, concrete was used. Due to the massive walls and large overhang of the roofs, air conditioning could be discounted in most buildings. The theatre hall was conceived as a place of encounter and exchange for people of different cultural and family backgrounds.[20]\n\n\n\n#### Zhoushan Harbour Development, China[edit]\n\n\nThe archipelago of Zhoushan in China is the site of an experimental urban rehabilitation project, led by the architect Wang Shu. Zhoushan is the Chinese capital of fishing, as it is situated at the entrance of the delta of the Yangtze River, and has a population of around one million. The aim of this project, started in 2009, was to transform the industrial harbour area, Putuo, into a touristic and cultural district. The architecture was designed to maintain a dialogue between modernity and the area's history and heritage. Sited on an island about 300 metres from the mainland, the chosen plot of land contains a dense assortment of buildings, docks and warehouses, built over several decades.\n\n\nKéré designed an exhibition gallery, an information centre, artists’ studios and a “cultural creativity garden” for the area. The scheme is designed around a platform that extends across the site all the way to the mountain, which borders the site to the west. This will serve as a space of transition between the man-made environment of the developed district and the natural environment beyond.\n\n\nThe best possible level of transparency is achieved by means of floor-to-ceiling glass elements. Sunlight gets into the rooms and there are unlimited views over the entire site. The southern and eastern facades are particularly exposed to the sun in summertime. Bamboo poles serve as exterior shades characterised by their natural irregular structure. Wood panels alternate with glass elements, thus the needs for both transparency and solar protection are met.\n\n\n\n#### Medical Centre, Léo[edit]\n\n\nIn 2012, Kéré Architecture embarked on a new project to build a medical centre in Léo. Léo is a town in Sicily Province in Burkina Faso situated near the border with Ghana, around 150 kilometres south of the capital city, Ouagadougou. The population of Léo is 50,000, but the medical centre will also serve the villages in the surrounding countryside. A high staff turnover rate and lack of smaller, local clinics mean that the district hospital is often overstretched and struggles to serve the whole community. The charity “Operieren in Afrika” decided to raise funds to build a medical clinic in Léo for small, simple operations. They will provide scholarships to trained doctors and nurses to staff the clinic, which will maintain a connection with Germany.\n\n\nAs the project had limited funding, Kéré Architecture used pre-planned modules as the basis for the project. As in the Gando secondary school, the walls were constructed from cast earth and the roofs from the tin. The modules are arranged so that their roofs overlap, in order to provide more shade. In the final phase of the design, the space between the modules has become interior space. The “corridor” of space between the rows of modules is a wide, open circulation space, with benches for people to relax on and trees for shade.\n\n\n\n#### International Red Cross and Red Crescent Museum, Geneva[edit]\n\n\nKéré was one of three architects chosen to design a permanent exhibition space at the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Museum, which opened in 2012 in Geneva, Switzerland. Each architect worked on a theme; Gringo Cardia (from Brazil) focused on “defending human dignity”, Shigeru Ban (from Japan) focused on “refusing fatality” and Kéré selected the theme “reconstructing the family link”.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nKéré contributed the dark entrance passage, bounded by hemp concrete walls, that encourages the visitor to consider the frightened and suffocating emotions of family tragedy during conflict. Central to this part of the exhibition is a tower, also made of hemp concrete, which is an architectural reference to a traditional hut for a nuclear family. It lets in very little light and has a Corten steel floor with a rusty appearance. This space is a memorial to tragedies such as the Srebrenica massacre. A Tree of Messages, with metal branches, was built to serve as a reminder of the cold contrast between nature and war. The connection between nature and the family is an important sub-theme in Kéré's part of the exhibition. The Room of Witnesses is a direct contrast to the tower as here the focus is on transparency and hope rather than darkness and despair. This space emphasizes the important role eyewitness testimony plays in humanitarian action.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Other work[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Serpentine Gallery Pavilion (2017) in London, the United Kingdom\nKéré has lectured and provided conceptual designs for projects in countries all over the world. His ideas were presented in the German Architecture Museum in Frankfurt and the Expo 2008. In Yemen he designed school building prototypes to fit the different climate regions of that country. Kéré designed a school and community centre for the village of Pouni in Burkina Faso.\n\n\nFrom October 2010 until January 2011 models and photos of Kéré's projects were featured at an exhibition entitled ‘Small Scale, Big Change: New Architectures of Social Engagement', at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. In June 2010, Kéré took part at the International Congress of Architecture and Society in Pamplona, entitled ‘Architecture: more for less'.\n\n\nIn 2014 Kéré participated to the exhibition *Sensing Spaces* at the Royal Academy of Arts. In 2016, his work was included in Alejandro Aravena's Venice Architecture Biennial, centered on low-tech construction techniques, traditional materials, and local knowledge.[21] From November 2016 to March 2017 Kéré presented his first monographic exhibition \"Francis Kéré. Radically Simple\" in Munich at Architekturmuseum der TU Munich.[22] In 2017, the Serpentine Galleries commissioned Kéré to design the Serpentine Pavilion in London.\n\n\nKéré designed Sarbalé ke, a vibrant installation consisting of 12 towers, for the art program of the 2019 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.[23]\n\n\n\n## Prizes[edit]\n\n\n* Aga Khan Award for Architecture (2004)[24][25]\n* Global Award for Sustainable Architecture (2009)[26][27][28]\n* Swiss Architectural Award (2010)[29]\n* Marcus prize for architecture (2011)[30]\n* Holcim Awards Gold 2011 Africa Middle East[31]\n* Global Holcim Awards 2012 Gold[32]\n* Schelling Architecture Award (2014)[33]\n* Kenneth Hudson Award for European Museum of the Year (2015)[34][35]\n* American Academy of Arts & Letters Arnold W.

Parallel to his studies, he established the Kéré Foundation (formerly Schulbausteine für Gando), and in 2005 he founded *Kéré Architecture*. His architectural practice has been recognized internationally with awards including the Aga Khan Award for Architecture (2004) for his first building, the Gando Primary School in Burkina Faso, and the Global Holcim Award for Sustainable Construction 2012 Gold.\n\n\nKéré has undertaken projects in various countries including Burkina Faso, Mali, Kenya, Uganda, Mozambique, Togo, Sudan, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, the US, and the UK.[4] In 2017 the Serpentine Galleries commissioned him to design the Serpentine Pavilion in London. He has held professorships at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, Yale School of Architecture and the Swiss Accademia di Architettura di Mendrisio. In 2017 he accepted the professorship for \"Architectural Design and Participation\" at the Technical University of Munich.\n\n\nIn 2022, he won the Pritzker Architecture Prize, the first person from Africa and the first Black person to do so.[2][5]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nKéré was born in the village of Gando, Burkina Faso. He was the first child in the village to be sent to school as his father, the village chief, wanted his eldest son to learn how to read and translate his letters. Since no school existed in Gando, Kéré had to leave his family when he was 7 years old to live with his uncle in the city. After finishing his education, he became a carpenter and received a scholarship from the Carl Duisberg Society to do an apprenticeship in Germany as a supervisor in development aid. After completing the apprenticeship, he went on to study architecture at the Technical University of Berlin, graduating in 2004.[4]\n\n\nDuring his studies he felt it was his duty to contribute to his family and to the community which had supported him, and to give the next generation the opportunity to follow in his footsteps. In 1998, with the help of his friends, Kéré set up the association Schulbausteine für Gando e.V. (now Kéré Foundation), which loosely translates as \"Building Blocks for Gando\", to fund the construction of a primary school for his village. His objective was to combine the knowledge he had gained in Europe, with traditional building methods from Burkina Faso. He completed his studies and built the first school in Gando as his diploma project in 2004, while also opening his own architectural office Kéré Architecture.[6][7][8][9][10][11]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nKéré is known for involving community in his projects and for his innovative use of vernacular materials and techniques.[12][11]\n\n\n\n### Teaching[edit]\n\n\nKéré has worked as a lecturer at the Technical University of Berlin. In spring 2011, he lectured at Virginia Tech, Washington University, and the University of Texas. The following summer he lectured at the University of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, and in autumn 2012 he was a visiting professor at Harvard. He also taught at the Accademia di Architettura di Mendrisio. Kéré accepted a newly created professorship for Architectural design and Participation at the Technical University of Munich in 2017. He was awarded a visiting professorship at the Yale School of Architecture. In 2021 Kéré took a position as guest professor at the Bauhaus University in Weimar, Germany.[13]\n\n\n\n### Architecture and design projects in Gando[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gando, Burkina Faso\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **may contain an excessive amount of intricate detail that may interest only a particular audience**. Please help by spinning off or relocating any relevant information, and removing excessive detail that may be against Wikipedia's inclusion policy. *(March 2022)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*\n |\n\n\nKéré began working to design a school for his home village of Gando while he was enrolled at the Technical University of Berlin.[14] The collaborative processes Kéré developed with Gando inhabitants and the innovative, local and ecological techniques and materials they created led Kéré to receive a Global Award for Sustainable Architecture in 2009.[15]\n\n\nKéré's architecture was conceived of and built with the help of village inhabitants. The village, located south east of Ouagadougou, has approximately 3000 inhabitants who live in mud huts without access to running water or electricity. According to the UN Human Development Index in 2011, Burkina Faso is the 7th-least developed country in the world. Most residents are subsistence farmers, remaining dependent on the harsh climate which has restricted rainfall between October and June, and high daytime temperatures of 45 °C.\n\n\n\n#### Gando Primary School[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Primary School in Gando\nKéré's primary school, the first for Gando, was completed in 2001. Schools in Burkina Faso are routinely built out of concrete, an expensive and energy consumptive material to produce, ill-suited to the local climate, as the interior becomes intolerably hot. Kéré wanted to use locally available resources and chose to build with earth in the form of mud bricks. Kéré's innovative design consisted of a wide, raised tin roof to protect the walls from rain, and allow air to circulate underneath for building cooling. The finished building was cooler and more pleasant inside than the conventional concrete school buildings. He won the Aga Khan Award for Architecture for the design in 2004.[16]\n\n\nKéré drew preliminary building plans in the sand to communicate with villagers, many of whom were illiterate, and found they fully engaged with the project, with many generating their own suggestions for improvement. Kéré said, “Only those who are involved in the development process can appreciate the results achieved, develop them further, and protect them”.[17] The entire population of Gando took part in the construction of the school. Village members received on-site training in construction techniques. Neighboring villages, impressed by Gando's community organization and achievement, set out to build their own schools.[18]\n\n\n\n#### Gando Mango Tree Project[edit]\n\n\nKéré initiated a project of planting mango trees to better meet the communities' needs and address several major problems in the region including malnutrition. Kéré developed a strategy in which prior to planting the tree, a hole is filled with old bones and meat, and left for a few days. Over time, the bones and meat attract ants, which colonize the hole and eat the termites. This enables the trees to grow without needing any insecticide. For natural fertilizer, chickens are kept in the shade of the trees. Kéré then had residents place hand-made clay pots next to the trees, with drippers targeted directly to the roots, which gave the trees a small but constant supply of water. The clay pots prevent evaporation loss and only need to be filled once a week.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n#### Gando Secondary School[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Secondary school in Gando\nConstruction of a secondary school designed by Kéré began in May 2011. The new building complex was designed to accommodate approximately 1000 students. The layout is inspired by the traditional rural households in Burkina Faso: the classrooms are set out in a circular fashion forming a protected courtyard, shielding it from the dust and sand brought by the Harmattan winds. The structure is open on its west side, allowing a cool breeze to enter the area, an innovative air-cooling system using only natural ventilation. The school is surrounded by a bank of earth, on which trees are planted. The trees provide shade, and rainwater is gathered to provide them with water. Perforated pipes are laid underneath the earth banks, and gather moisture. Wind cools down as it blows through the pipes, and emerges in the classrooms through holes in the floor, providing a zero emissions under-floor cooling system. This design won the 2012 Global Holcim Award for Sustainable Construction Gold.[4]\n\n\nThe secondary school uses the same roof design as the primary school, with a wide corrugated iron roof raised above a clay ceiling. Air circulates between the ceiling and roof, heats up and rises, creating a suction current below. This causes the cool air from the under-floor pipes to rise, reducing room temperature by an estimated 6 – 8 °C. With simple yet effective methods such as these, the school requires little electricity both for construction and maintenance. In order to combat deforestation issues Burkina Faso faces, the secondary school used wood from eucalyptus trees for construction, and mango trees were planted in their place. The mango trees need less water, produce fruit and provide more shade than eucalyptus trees.\n\n\nAs with Kéré's other projects, the secondary school uses local manpower for construction. Specialists trained by Kéré supervise members of the local community, training them in the necessary building techniques. Rather than building the walls brick by brick, Kéré has devised a quicker way of pouring mud and a small quantity of cement into a mould. \n\n\n\n#### Atelier Gando[edit]\n\n\nDeveloped in 2014, the Atelier is a building which functions as a community center and on-site base for building projects. A group of students from the Accademia di Architettura di Mendrisio helped Kéré plan and build the first steps of the construction.[19]\n\n\n\n### Other architecture and design projects[edit]\n\n\n#### Dano Secondary School[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Secondary school in Dano, Burkina Faso\nThe secondary school project in Dano, Burkina Faso was inspired by Kéré's previous work in Gando. The excessive daytime heat was once again the major issue, but this time there were different local resources. Laterite stone, native to the region, was used as the main building material. The building was set at an east–west orientation which reduces direct solar radiation onto the walls, and the sharply protruding roof creates a lot of shade. The roof design with its system of natural ventilation allows the air to circulate between the mud brick ceiling and the raised tin roof. The building consists of three classrooms, a computer room and an office. There is also an amphitheatre designed for use during break times. Finished in 2007, the building work was largely done by people trained in the Gando school projects, giving them the opportunity to use and develop their skills, while also reducing construction costs.\n\n\n\n#### Centre for Earth Architecture, Mopti[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Centre for Earth Architecture in Mopti, Mali\nThe Aga Khan Trust for Culture has spent over 10 years renovating mosques in Northern Mali. Finished in 2010, the Centre for Earth Architecture in Mopti is part of this series of projects, following the restoration of the mosque and the construction of a new sewerage system. The centre is intended to be much more than an exhibition space: the building is the product of the same ancient building techniques used in the Great Mosques in Mopti, Timbuktu and Djenné. It demonstrates how a material that is a part of the area's heritage can be used in a modern context. The centre is made up of an exhibition hall, a community centre, public toilets and a restaurant, responding to the needs of the district management of Komoguel and visitors to the area, as well as the local community.\n\n\nFrom the top of the flood barrier, it can be seen that the building is aligned with the mosque. The building has a simple structure and its height corresponds to the neighbouring buildings without compromising the view of the mosque. When viewed from across the lake the centre manages to maintain a connection with the mosque but does not dominate the view.\n\n\nThe centre is divided into three different buildings which are connected by two roof surfaces. Clay for the building was brought from 5 km away, so that the red colour would contrast with the colour of the local buildings, which are all made using traditional mud construction. The rusty red colour of the laterite clay is due to its high iron oxide content. All the walls and barrel vaults in the centre are made out of BTC (compressed earth blocks) and are not plastered or painted. These are very well suited to the climatic conditions as they create a natural temperature buffer, making indoor temperatures much more comfortable. The overhanging roof blocks keep the walls cool and provide shaded outdoor spaces. The building is naturally ventilated through openings in the walls and vaults, therefore, mechanical air conditioning is not needed. Most vernacular buildings in Mopti have wooden ceilings filled with clay. Kéré used a new system in this building that involves no wood – BTC vaults. He wants to promote the use of clay but to be sparing in his use of wood, as deforestation is a huge environmental issue in Mali.\n\n\n\n#### Opera Village[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Opera Village Africa\n\n![](image)Construction of the Remdoogo Opera Village in Laongo, Burkina Faso\nThe Opera House for Africa project was initiated by German film and theatre director Christoph Schlingensief. Schlingensief brought Kéré on board to develop a housing prototype for people affected by flooding. The Remdoogo opera village was constructed on a 12-hectare site on a small rise in Laongo, one hour's drive from Ouagadougou and overlooking the West African landscape of the Sahel. A festival theatre, workshops, medical centre and guest houses were designed, as well as solar panels, a well, and a school for up to 500 children and teenagers with music and film classes. The stage and auditorium were designed and constructed in Germany and later transferred to the opera village. Kéré used Burkinabe fabrics to cover seat rows and interior walls.\n\n\nSimple basic modules, which vary in quality and function depending on the equipment they house, comprise the entire village. Local people were employed to build the modules, and local materials such as clay, laterite, cement bricks, gum wood and loam rendering were used for construction. For reinforcing elements such as beams, columns, ring beams, and foundations, concrete was used. Due to the massive walls and large overhang of the roofs, air conditioning could be discounted in most buildings. The theatre hall was conceived as a place of encounter and exchange for people of different cultural and family backgrounds.[20]\n\n\n\n#### Zhoushan Harbour Development, China[edit]\n\n\nThe archipelago of Zhoushan in China is the site of an experimental urban rehabilitation project, led by the architect Wang Shu. Zhoushan is the Chinese capital of fishing, as it is situated at the entrance of the delta of the Yangtze River, and has a population of around one million. The aim of this project, started in 2009, was to transform the industrial harbour area, Putuo, into a touristic and cultural district. The architecture was designed to maintain a dialogue between modernity and the area's history and heritage. Sited on an island about 300 metres from the mainland, the chosen plot of land contains a dense assortment of buildings, docks and warehouses, built over several decades.\n\n\nKéré designed an exhibition gallery, an information centre, artists’ studios and a “cultural creativity garden” for the area. The scheme is designed around a platform that extends across the site all the way to the mountain, which borders the site to the west. This will serve as a space of transition between the man-made environment of the developed district and the natural environment beyond.\n\n\nThe best possible level of transparency is achieved by means of floor-to-ceiling glass elements. Sunlight gets into the rooms and there are unlimited views over the entire site. The southern and eastern facades are particularly exposed to the sun in summertime. Bamboo poles serve as exterior shades characterised by their natural irregular structure. Wood panels alternate with glass elements, thus the needs for both transparency and solar protection are met.\n\n\n\n#### Medical Centre, Léo[edit]\n\n\nIn 2012, Kéré Architecture embarked on a new project to build a medical centre in Léo. Léo is a town in Sicily Province in Burkina Faso situated near the border with Ghana, around 150 kilometres south of the capital city, Ouagadougou. The population of Léo is 50,000, but the medical centre will also serve the villages in the surrounding countryside. A high staff turnover rate and lack of smaller, local clinics mean that the district hospital is often overstretched and struggles to serve the whole community. The charity “Operieren in Afrika” decided to raise funds to build a medical clinic in Léo for small, simple operations. They will provide scholarships to trained doctors and nurses to staff the clinic, which will maintain a connection with Germany.\n\n\nAs the project had limited funding, Kéré Architecture used pre-planned modules as the basis for the project. As in the Gando secondary school, the walls were constructed from cast earth and the roofs from the tin. The modules are arranged so that their roofs overlap, in order to provide more shade. In the final phase of the design, the space between the modules has become interior space. The “corridor” of space between the rows of modules is a wide, open circulation space, with benches for people to relax on and trees for shade.\n\n\n\n#### International Red Cross and Red Crescent Museum, Geneva[edit]\n\n\nKéré was one of three architects chosen to design a permanent exhibition space at the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Museum, which opened in 2012 in Geneva, Switzerland. Each architect worked on a theme; Gringo Cardia (from Brazil) focused on “defending human dignity”, Shigeru Ban (from Japan) focused on “refusing fatality” and Kéré selected the theme “reconstructing the family link”.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nKéré contributed the dark entrance passage, bounded by hemp concrete walls, that encourages the visitor to consider the frightened and suffocating emotions of family tragedy during conflict. Central to this part of the exhibition is a tower, also made of hemp concrete, which is an architectural reference to a traditional hut for a nuclear family. It lets in very little light and has a Corten steel floor with a rusty appearance. This space is a memorial to tragedies such as the Srebrenica massacre. A Tree of Messages, with metal branches, was built to serve as a reminder of the cold contrast between nature and war. The connection between nature and the family is an important sub-theme in Kéré's part of the exhibition. The Room of Witnesses is a direct contrast to the tower as here the focus is on transparency and hope rather than darkness and despair. This space emphasizes the important role eyewitness testimony plays in humanitarian action.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Other work[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Serpentine Gallery Pavilion (2017) in London, the United Kingdom\nKéré has lectured and provided conceptual designs for projects in countries all over the world. His ideas were presented in the German Architecture Museum in Frankfurt and the Expo 2008. In Yemen he designed school building prototypes to fit the different climate regions of that country. Kéré designed a school and community centre for the village of Pouni in Burkina Faso.\n\n\nFrom October 2010 until January 2011 models and photos of Kéré's projects were featured at an exhibition entitled ‘Small Scale, Big Change: New Architectures of Social Engagement', at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. In June 2010, Kéré took part at the International Congress of Architecture and Society in Pamplona, entitled ‘Architecture: more for less'.\n\n\nIn 2014 Kéré participated to the exhibition *Sensing Spaces* at the Royal Academy of Arts. In 2016, his work was included in Alejandro Aravena's Venice Architecture Biennial, centered on low-tech construction techniques, traditional materials, and local knowledge.[21] From November 2016 to March 2017 Kéré presented his first monographic exhibition \"Francis Kéré. Radically Simple\" in Munich at Architekturmuseum der TU Munich.[22] In 2017, the Serpentine Galleries commissioned Kéré to design the Serpentine Pavilion in London.\n\n\nKéré designed Sarbalé ke, a vibrant installation consisting of 12 towers, for the art program of the 2019 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.[23]\n\n\n\n## Prizes[edit]\n\n\n* Aga Khan Award for Architecture (2004)[24][25]\n* Global Award for Sustainable Architecture (2009)[26][27][28]\n* Swiss Architectural Award (2010)[29]\n* Marcus prize for architecture (2011)[30]\n* Holcim Awards Gold 2011 Africa Middle East[31]\n* Global Holcim Awards 2012 Gold[32]\n* Schelling Architecture Award (2014)[33]\n* Kenneth Hudson Award for European Museum of the Year (2015)[34][35]\n* American Academy of Arts & Letters Arnold W.

She runs the architectural practice Lacaton & Vassal, with Jean-Philippe Vassal. The pair were jointly awarded the 2021 Pritzker Prize.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nShe was born in Saint-Pardoux-la-Rivière on 2 August 1955.[2] Lacaton graduated in architecture from the École nationale supérieure d'architecture et de paysage de Bordeaux and received a master's degree in urban planning from the University of Bordeaux in 1984.[4][5] Lacaton often visited Vassal in Niger, who worked there as an architect and town planner; they built their first joint project, a straw hut.[6]\n\n\n\n## Architectural practice[edit]\n\n\nIn 1987, Lacaton formed the practice Lacaton & Vassal, with Jean-Philippe Vassal.[7] Initially based in Bordeaux, the practice moved to Paris in 2000.[8] Lacaton & Vassal's work focuses on reduced-cost construction.[9] Many projects are hybrids between a contemporary building concept and more diverse techniques, upsetting building contractors' standard practices.[10]\n\n\nThe firm renovated the Palais de Tokyo contemporary art museum in Paris, completed in 2001. The project, a bare bones reclamation of an art deco building near the Seine, was short-listed for the EU Mies Award in 2003.[11]\n\n\nIn 2005, Lacaton & Vassal and architect Frédéric Druot were selected to reshape the Tour Bois le Prêtre, a 17-story housing tower on Paris' northern edge designed by architect Raymond Lopez in 1957. The team cut away most of the thick façade's panels, installing balconies and large sliding windows in their place, opening the apartments to more natural light. The units were also enlarged and opened, and the firm installed new plumbing, bathrooms, ventilation, and electric systems. The project was a runner up in the Design of the Year award from the UK's Design Museum in 2013, coming top of the architecture category.[12]\n\n\n\n![](image)The School of Architecture, Nantes\nThe practice has also worked on the École Nationale Supérieure d'Architecture in Nantes; the art collection project FRAC Nord-Pas de Calais in Dunkirk; the Cap Ferret residential building in Cap Ferret,[13] and the Grand Parc Bordeaux (with Frédéric Druot and Christophe Hutin). This last project was the winner of the EU Mies 2019 Award, for the best contemporary architecture in Europe.[14]\n\n\nLacaton & Vassal have worked with Frederic Druot on sustainable housing projects, reinventing old 1960s era social housing in a project called Plus.[11] Plus is an initiative to upgrade old social housing into better living spaces. They've published literature on the project.[11]\n\n\n\n## Academic career[edit]\n\n\nLacaton was visiting professor at the Higher Technical School of Architecture of Madrid (2007–13);[15] EPFL (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne; 2004, 2006, 2010–11 and 2017–18);[16][17] University of Florida (2012); State University of New York at Buffalo (2013); Pavillon Neuflize OBC-Palais de Tokyo, Paris (2013–14); and Harvard University.[10] Lacaton was appointed as Associate Professor of Architecture & Design at ETH Zurich in 2017.[18]\n\n\nHer academic teaching focuses on an ideological and socio-political approach to architecture. Lacaton's designs and constructions support human use rather than iconic display, concerned with the people involved. Her designs aim to promote user participation, such as residents in areas undergoing redevelopment.[10]\n\n\nAnne Lacaton served as a jury member for The Daylight Award in 2020 and 2022.\n\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\n### Lacaton & Vassal[edit]\n\n\n* Lauréats des Albums de la Jeune Architecture, France – 1991[19]\n* Grand Prix National d'Architecture Jeune Talent, France – 1999[19]\n* Erich Schelling Award − 2006[19]\n* Fondation Erich Schelling, Karlsruhe Award \"Sustainability and Residential Innovation\", City of Madrid – 2006[19]\n* Royal Institute of British Architects International Fellowship in 2009.[20]\n* Grand prix national de l'architecture in 2008[21]\n* Paris, France Equerre d'Argent Award (with Frederic Druot) – 2011[19]\n* Paris Daylight & Building Components Award – 2011[19]\n* Design of the year, architecture category (with Frederic Druot) – 2013[19]\n* Rolf Schock Prize in the Visual Arts in 2014[22]\n* Life Time Achievement – Trienal de Arquitectura de Lisboa – 2016[19]\n* Académie de l'Architecture France – Gold Medal – 2016[19]\n* Simon Architecture Prize/ Fondation Mies Van der Rohe – The Living Places (with Frederic Druot) – 2016[19]\n* Heinrich Tessenow Medal in 2016[23][19]\n* Global Award for Sustainable Architecture (with Frederic Druot) in 2018[24]\n* Mies van der Rohe Award in 2019[13]\n* Großer BDA Preis (BDA Grand Prize) in 2020 for their life's work[25]\n* Pritzker Architecture Prize in 2021[3]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Lacaton & Vassal\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Transformation of 530 dwellings / Lacaton & Vassal + Frédéric Druot + Christophe Hutin architecture\". *ArchDaily*. 18 April 2019.

Her designs aim to promote user participation, such as residents in areas undergoing redevelopment.[10]\n\n\nAnne Lacaton served as a jury member for The Daylight Award in 2020 and 2022.\n\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\n### Lacaton & Vassal[edit]\n\n\n* Lauréats des Albums de la Jeune Architecture, France – 1991[19]\n* Grand Prix National d'Architecture Jeune Talent, France – 1999[19]\n* Erich Schelling Award − 2006[19]\n* Fondation Erich Schelling, Karlsruhe Award \"Sustainability and Residential Innovation\", City of Madrid – 2006[19]\n* Royal Institute of British Architects International Fellowship in 2009.[20]\n* Grand prix national de l'architecture in 2008[21]\n* Paris, France Equerre d'Argent Award (with Frederic Druot) – 2011[19]\n* Paris Daylight & Building Components Award – 2011[19]\n* Design of the year, architecture category (with Frederic Druot) – 2013[19]\n* Rolf Schock Prize in the Visual Arts in 2014[22]\n* Life Time Achievement – Trienal de Arquitectura de Lisboa – 2016[19]\n* Académie de l'Architecture France – Gold Medal – 2016[19]\n* Simon Architecture Prize/ Fondation Mies Van der Rohe – The Living Places (with Frederic Druot) – 2016[19]\n* Heinrich Tessenow Medal in 2016[23][19]\n* Global Award for Sustainable Architecture (with Frederic Druot) in 2018[24]\n* Mies van der Rohe Award in 2019[13]\n* Großer BDA Preis (BDA Grand Prize) in 2020 for their life's work[25]\n* Pritzker Architecture Prize in 2021[3]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Lacaton & Vassal\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Transformation of 530 dwellings / Lacaton & Vassal + Frédéric Druot + Christophe Hutin architecture\". *ArchDaily*. 18 April 2019.

He was awarded the Royal Gold Medal in 1986 and the Pritzker Architecture Prize in 2019. He taught at Columbia University, Harvard University, and Yale University.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Biography[edit]\n\n\nIsozaki was born in Oita on the island of Kyushu and grew up in the era of postwar Japan,[4] the eldest of four children of Toji and Tetsu Isozaki. His father was a prominent businessmen.[2] In 1945, he witnessed the destruction of Hiroshima on the shore opposite his hometown. [2] When he accepted the Pritzker Prize in 2019 he stated: \"There was no architecture, no buildings, and not even a city. So my first experience of architecture was the void of architecture, and I began to consider how people might rebuild their homes and cities.\"[2]\n\n\nIsozaki completed his schooling at the Oita Prefecture Oita Uenogaoka High School (erstwhile Oita Junior High School). In 1954, he graduated from the University of Tokyo where he majored in Architecture and Engineering. He completed a doctoral program in architecture from the same university in 1961.[1] Isozaki also worked under Kenzo Tange before establishing his own firm in 1963.[1]\n\n\nIsozaki's early projects were influenced by European experiences with a style mixed between \"New Brutalism\" and \"Metabolist Architecture\" (Oita Medical Hall, 1959–1960), according to Reyner Banham. His style continued to evolve with buildings such as the Fujimi Country Club (1973–74) and Kitakyushu Central Library (1973–74). Later he developed a more modernistic style with buildings such as the Art Tower of Mito (1986–90) and Domus-Casa del Hombre (1991–1995) in Galicia, Spain. In 1983, he supported an apparently unbuildable entry for a sports club in Hong King by the then-unknown architect Zaha Hadid.[2] In 1985 he designed the interior of New York City's Palladium nightclub.[6] The Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA) in Los Angeles, completed in 1986, was his second international project and his best known work in the U.S.[4]\n\n\nIn 2005, Arata Isozaki founded the Italian branch of his office, Arata Isozaki & Andrea Maffei Associates. Two major projects from this office are the Allianz Tower CityLife office tower, a redevelopment project in the former trade fair area in Milan and the new Town Library in Maranello, Italy.[7]\n\n\nDespite designing buildings both inside and outside Japan, Isozaki was sometimes described as an architect who refused to be stuck in one architectural style, highlighting \"how each of his designs is a specific solution born out of the project’s context.\"[8] Isozaki won the Pritzker Architecture Prize in 2019.[3]\n\n\nIsozaki died on 28 December 2022, at the age of 91.[9]\n\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\n* Annual Prize, Architectural Institute of Japan in 1967 and 1975[10]\n* Mainichi Art Award in 1983\n* RIBA Gold Medal in 1986[10]\n* International Award \"Architecture in Stone\" in 1987\n* Arnold W.

He was awarded the Royal Gold Medal in 1986 and the Pritzker Architecture Prize in 2019. He taught at Columbia University, Harvard University, and Yale University.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Biography[edit]\n\n\nIsozaki was born in Oita on the island of Kyushu and grew up in the era of postwar Japan,[4] the eldest of four children of Toji and Tetsu Isozaki. His father was a prominent businessmen.[2] In 1945, he witnessed the destruction of Hiroshima on the shore opposite his hometown. [2] When he accepted the Pritzker Prize in 2019 he stated: \"There was no architecture, no buildings, and not even a city. So my first experience of architecture was the void of architecture, and I began to consider how people might rebuild their homes and cities.\"[2]\n\n\nIsozaki completed his schooling at the Oita Prefecture Oita Uenogaoka High School (erstwhile Oita Junior High School). In 1954, he graduated from the University of Tokyo where he majored in Architecture and Engineering. He completed a doctoral program in architecture from the same university in 1961.[1] Isozaki also worked under Kenzo Tange before establishing his own firm in 1963.[1]\n\n\nIsozaki's early projects were influenced by European experiences with a style mixed between \"New Brutalism\" and \"Metabolist Architecture\" (Oita Medical Hall, 1959–1960), according to Reyner Banham. His style continued to evolve with buildings such as the Fujimi Country Club (1973–74) and Kitakyushu Central Library (1973–74). Later he developed a more modernistic style with buildings such as the Art Tower of Mito (1986–90) and Domus-Casa del Hombre (1991–1995) in Galicia, Spain. In 1983, he supported an apparently unbuildable entry for a sports club in Hong King by the then-unknown architect Zaha Hadid.[2] In 1985 he designed the interior of New York City's Palladium nightclub.[6] The Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA) in Los Angeles, completed in 1986, was his second international project and his best known work in the U.S.[4]\n\n\nIn 2005, Arata Isozaki founded the Italian branch of his office, Arata Isozaki & Andrea Maffei Associates. Two major projects from this office are the Allianz Tower CityLife office tower, a redevelopment project in the former trade fair area in Milan and the new Town Library in Maranello, Italy.[7]\n\n\nDespite designing buildings both inside and outside Japan, Isozaki was sometimes described as an architect who refused to be stuck in one architectural style, highlighting \"how each of his designs is a specific solution born out of the project’s context.\"[8] Isozaki won the Pritzker Architecture Prize in 2019.[3]\n\n\nIsozaki died on 28 December 2022, at the age of 91.[9]\n\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\n* Annual Prize, Architectural Institute of Japan in 1967 and 1975[10]\n* Mainichi Art Award in 1983\n* RIBA Gold Medal in 1986[10]\n* International Award \"Architecture in Stone\" in 1987\n* Arnold W.
