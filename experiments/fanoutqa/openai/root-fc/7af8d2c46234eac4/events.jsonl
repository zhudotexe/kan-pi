Austin State University[edit]\n\n\nOn November 29, 2022, the Board of Regents of Stephen F. Austin State University (SFA) announced their decision to accept an invitation to join the UT System. This decision occurred following an announcement at the start of the fall semester by SFA President Steve Westbrook that the board was considering joining a system. At the time, Stephen F. Austin was one of two independent public universities in Texas, alongside Texas Southern University. The Texas A&M University System, the Texas Tech University System, and the Texas State University System all extended invitations as well. The decision to join the UT System was made following a process that included faculty, staff, student, and alumni input.[5] Stephen F. Austin's addition to the UT System was approved by the Texas Legislature during the 2023 session. The identically worded House and Senate bills that would formally add SFA to the UT System specified that SFA would retain its name, but with the phrase \"a member of The University of Texas System\" appended to the legal school name. They also stated that SFA would be technically dissolved and then immediately reconstituted as a member of the UT System.[36] The Senate unanimously passed its bill on April 16, 2023,[37] and the House passed its version on April 26.[38] Governor Greg Abbott signed the measure into law on May 10.[39]\n\n\n\n#### UT Brownsville and UT Pan American (UTRGV) merger[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University of Texas Rio Grande Valley\n\nOn June 14, 2013, Texas Governor Rick Perry signed a law officially approving the creation of a new university in South Texas within the UT System and replacing UT Brownsville and UT Pan American. The initiative resulted in a single institution, including a medical school, spanning the entire Rio Grande Valley, with a presence in each of the major metropolitan areas of Brownsville, Edinburg, Harlingen, and McAllen. On December 12, 2013, the UT Board of Regents voted to name the new university the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley.[40] The new university began full operation in the 2015â16 school year.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Official name\n | Officialabbreviations\n | Location\n | Founded\n | Joinedsystem\n | Merged\n | Refs\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| The University of Texas at Brownsville | UTB\nUT Brownsville\n | Brownsville | 1973\n | 1991\n | 2015(merged to form The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley) | [41][42] |\n| The University of TexasâPan American | UTPA\nUT Pan American\n | Edinburg | 1927\n | 1989\n | [43][44] |\n\n\n#### UT Tyler and UTHSC Tyler merger[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University of Texas at Tyler\n\nIn December 2019, the UT System Board of Regents unanimously agreed to merge The University of Texas Health Science Center at Tyler (UTHSCT) under The University of Texas at Tyler (UTT), creating a single unified institution.[45] Two months later, the UT System formally announced its intention to establish a new medical school that will be added under the new unified UT Tyler administration.[46] It will be the first medical school in the East Texas region.\n\n\nOn December 8, 2020, The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Schools approved a plan to merge UT Tyler and UTHSCT. UTHSCT will retain its status as a health-related institution but will now come under the administration of UT Tyler. The UT System Board of Regents met in late December 2020 and took action on the implementation of the merger which began on January 1, 2021.[47]\n\n\nOn January 4, 2021, the Board of Regents installed Kirk A. Calhoun, M.D. as president of the newly aligned UT Tyler and UTHSCT. As of January 4, these two institutions are officially one. On January 15, 2021 the institution publicly named the new line of executive leadership for the merged institution.[48]\n\n\nThe medical school is expected to open in 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Official name\n | Officialabbreviations\n | Location\n | Founded\n | Joinedsystem\n | Merged\n | Refs\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| The University of Texas at Tyler | UTT\nUT Tyler\n | Tyler | 1971\n | 1979\n | 2021(merged as The University of Texas at Tyler) | [49][32] |\n| The University of Texas Health Science Center at Tyler | UTHSCT\nUT Health Tyler\n | Tyler | 1943\n | 1977\n | [50][51] |\n\n\n### Health institutions[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Texas System has 5 independent health institutions. None are officially associated with any of the 4-year academic institutions, though some may have close relationships or special joint programs with them due to geographical location (DallasâFort Worth area institutions & San Antonio institutions) or historical relationships (UT Austin & UT Medical Branch at Galveston).\n\n\nUT MD Anderson Cancer Center is one of the six schools at UT Health Science Center at Houston. Despite being officially associated under UT Houston, the UT System lists MD Anderson as a separate health institution due to its unique specialization.\n\n\nAdditionally, there are medical schools at UT Austin and UT Rio Grande Valley that are not directly affiliated with any of the independent health institutions.[52] The third medical school organized under an academic institution in the UT System will open in 2023 under the UT Tyler administration.\n\n\n\n#### Independent UT Health institutions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Official name\n | Officialabbreviations\n | Medical school\n | Location\n | Estab.\n | Refs\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio | UTHSA or\nUTHSCSA\nUT Health San Antonio\n | Long School of Medicine | San Antonio (main), Laredo | 1959\n | [53][54] |\n| The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston | UTH\nUTHealth or\nUT Houston\n | McGovern Medical School | Houston | 1972\n | [55] |\n| The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center | UTMDACC\nMD Anderson\n | N/A (associated with UTH)\n | Houston (main), Katy, League City,\nMemorial City, Sugar Land, The Woodlands\n | 1941\n | [56] |\n| The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston | UTMB\nUT Galveston\n | John Sealy School of Medicine\n | Galveston | 1891\n | [57] |\n| The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center | UTSW\nUT Southwestern\n | UTSW Medical School\n | Dallas (main), Fort Worth,\nFrisco, Irving, Richardson\n | 1943\n | [58][59] |\n\n\n#### Medical schools within academic institutions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Medical school\n | Academic institution affiliation\n | Location\n | Estab.\n | Refs\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Dell Medical School | UT Austin | Austin | 2013\n | [60] |\n| UTRGV School of Medicine | UT Rio Grande Valley | Harlingen (main), Brownsville, Edinburg | 2013\n | [61] |\n| UT Tyler School of Medicine\\*\n(\\**In Development, Projected Opening 2023*)\n | UT Tyler | Tyler | 2023\n | [62] |\n\n  \n\n\n* ![UT Health Science Center - Houston](image)\n\nUT Health Science Center - Houston\n* ![UT Health Science Center - San Antonio](image)\n\nUT Health Science Center - San Antonio\n* ![UT MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX)](image)\n\nUT MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX)\n* ![UT Medical Branch at Galveston](image)\n\nUT Medical Branch at Galveston\n* ![UT Southwestern Medical Center (Dallas, TX)](image)\n\nUT Southwestern Medical Center (Dallas, TX)\n\n\n#### Attempted academic and health institutions and mergers[edit]\n\n\n**DallasâFort Worth**\n\n\nIn 2001 the 77th Texas Legislature proposed HB 3568, which would have merged all DallasâFort Worth UT System institutions (UT Dallas, UT Arlington, and UT Southwestern) under the name \"*The University of Texas at Dallas*\". UTD's Richardson campus would have been designated as the main campus, UTA's Arlington campus would have become a satellite campus, and UTSW's Dallas campus would have become the merged university's medical school.[63] The purpose was to help the metroplex gain one unified flagship-level university, but the House Bill ultimately failed to pass due to objections from UT Arlington (which wanted to retain its identity as a separate university) and the lack of time to properly explain the complex process to state representatives.[64]\n\n\n**San Antonio**\n\n\nNine years later, in 2010, a study was commissioned to explore the possibility of merging UT San Antonio and UT Health San Antonio.[65] Officials ultimately decided against it, citing significant costs, administrative challenges, and different university cultures.[66] In 2016, an op-ed published in the San Antonio Express-News urged the UT System Board of Regents to reconsider their decision, but no further actions from the UT System have been taken since.[67]\n\n\n**Houston**\n\n\nIn 2015, the UT System purchased 300 acres of land in the Houston area for $215 million for the development of a research campus, spearheaded by then-Chancellor William H. McRaven.[68] While the UT System publicly denied plans to build a new university on the land, the land acquisition drew criticism from the University of Houston System and several Texas State Senators, notably John Whitmire, focusing on the UT System encroaching on the UH System, given the UT System's access to the Permanent University Fund, as well as the process by which the land was purchased.[69] In 2017, the UT System announced it would be cancelling plans for the Houston campus.[70][71]\n\n\n\n## Students[edit]\n\n\n\n\nRacial and/or ethnic background (2015)\n|  | Students[72] | Texas[73] | United States[74] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Asian** | 11% | 5% | 6%\n |\n| **Black** | 7% | 13% | 13%\n |\n| **Hispanic** (of any race, includes Tejanos and White Hispanics)\n | 39% | 39% | 18%\n |\n| **Non-Hispanic White** | 30% | 43% | 61%\n |\n| **International student** | 9% | N/A | N/A\n |\n| **Other races or unknown** | 4% | 3% | N/A\n |\n\n\n## Administration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Headquarters\nThe administrative offices are in Downtown Austin.[75] The UT system approved moving the system headquarters in November 2012.[76] Bonds from the UT System's endowment funded the construction of the new 19-story, 330,000-square-foot (31,000Â m2) headquarters, which had a price tag of $102 million. The UT System planned to lease a portion of the facility for shops and other offices, with the approximately 200,000-square-foot (19,000Â m2) remaining portion used for its own employees.[77] The system headquarters opened on August 1, 2017.[78]\n\n\nIn July 2018, the Pentagon announced it had selected the UT System administrative building as the headquarters for the Army Futures Command, a new organization committed to coordinating modernization efforts and integrating innovation across the Army.\n\n\nThe University of Texas System was previously headquartered in O. Henry Hall in Downtown Austin.[79] The system headquarters complex previously included multiple buildings, which had 550 employees in 2014.[77] These facilities included O. Henry Hall, Claudia Taylor Johnson Hall (named after Lady Bird Johnson), Ashbel Smith Hall, the Colorado Building, and the Lavaca Building,\n\n\nIn 2013 the UT system approved the demolitions of the Colorado Building and the Lavaca Building,[76] and the new UT System headquarters was built where these buildings previously stood.[77] The Texas State University System purchased O. Henry Hall in 2015 for $8.2 million;[76] the UT System leased it and continued using it as its administrative headquarters prior to the 2017 completion of the UT System's current headquarters.[80] The UT System leased the land containing Claudia Taylor Johnson Hall and Ashbel Smith Hall to Trammell Crow[76] which is constructing a commercial property on the site that uses the facade of Johnson Hall. Ashbel Smith Hall was imploded on March 25, 2018.[81]\n\n\n\n## Coordinated Admissions Program[edit]\n\n\nThe Coordinated Admissions Program (CAP) offers some UT Austin applicants the chance to attend the university if they complete their freshman year at another system school and meet specified requirements.[82] Each institution in the University of Texas System sets its own admissions standards, and not all schools may accept a particular CAP student.[82]\n\n\nUT Dallas does not participate in the CAP program, and University of Texas at San Antonio, the largest recipient of CAP students, has stated that it will be phasing out the program within the next ten years.[83][84]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Permanent University Fund\n* Education in Texas\n* University of Texas at Austin admissions controversy\n* List of colleges and universities in the United States by endowment over $1 billion\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Seal of the University\". *University of Texas System*.

Through a statewide network of 11 universities and eight state agencies, and the RELLIS Campus, the Texas A&M System educates more than 153,000 students and makes more than 22 million additional educational contacts through service and outreach programs each year. System-wide, research and development expenditures exceeded $996 million in FY 2017 and helped drive the state's economy.[5]\n\n\nThe system's flagship institution is Texas A&M University in College Station. The letters \"A&M\", originally A.M.C. and short for \"Agricultural and Mechanical College\", are retained as a tribute to the university's former designation.\n\n\n\n![](image)Map of Texas A&M University System\n\n\n## Component institutions[edit]\n\n\nThe founding member of the A&M System is Texas A&M University, established in 1876. Prairie View A&M, also established in 1876, is an HBCU. Many of the member universities and agencies joined the A&M System decades after being established.

Southern regions of the state also are further served by the Coastal Bend Health Education Center, which covers the 19-county region surrounding Corpus Christi and Kingsville, and the South Texas Center at McAllen.\n\n\nTexas A&M Health received full accreditation in December 2002 from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to award baccalaureate, master's, doctoral and professional degrees. Its components are accredited by accrediting organizations specific to their areas.\n\n\nThe Health Science Center in 2013 was merged into Texas A&M University proper and is no longer an independent institution.

Founded in 1817, the university is the oldest and largest in Michigan; it was established twenty years before the territory became a state. It is also a founding member of the Association of American Universities.\n\n\nSince 1871, Michigan has been a coeducational institution. In 2021, it enrolled approximately 32,000 undergraduate students and 18,000 graduate students.[8] The university consists of 19 colleges and offers degree programs at undergraduate and graduate levels in some 250 disciplines. Michigan also has two regional universities, one in Flint and one in Dearborn, as well as a center in Detroit. Undergraduate admission to the university is categorized as \"most selective\"[9] and the university is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities â Very high research activity\".\n\n\nThe university's alumni include 8 domestic and foreign heads of state or heads of government; 47 U.S. senators; 218 members of the U.S. House of Representatives; 42 U.S. Cabinet secretaries; 41 U.S. governors; and 26 living billionaires.[10] As of 2022, Wolverine athletes have won 188 medals at the Olympic Games.[11]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the University of Michigan\n\n### 1817â1837[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Michigan was established on August 26, 1817,[1] as *Catholepistemiad*, or *Catholepistemiad Michigania***,** under an act of the Michigan Territory. The corporate existence of the university had its rise in the Act of 1817, and has been continuous throughout all subsequent changes of its organic law.[12]:â11*Catholepistemiad,* a neologism, translates roughly as \"School of Universal Knowledge.\"[13]\n\n\n*Catholepistemiad* was not a university in the contemporary sense but rather a centralized system of schools, libraries, and other cultural institutions borrowing its model from the Imperial University of France founded by Napoleon I a decade earlier.[14][12]:â10 Besides carrying on the central institution, the President and Didactorium of *Catholepistemiad* were also authorized to establish private colleges, academies, libraries, etc., throughout the Michigan Territory.[12]:â10 It was only after the state of Michigan entered the Union in 1837 that a new plan was adopted to focus the corporation on higher education.[14] The charter of *Catholepistemiad* is an extraordinary example of the marked French influence upon American institutions which found its inception during the course of the Revolutionary War, and continued until it began to give way to German influence in the third or fourth decade of the 19th century.[12]:â10\n\n\nShortly after the passage of the Act of 1817, Rev. John Monteith became the first president of *Catholepistemiad*, and Father Gabriel Richard, a Catholic priest, was vice president. Monteith and Richard enacted that private schools should be established in Detroit, Monroe and Mackinaw, and before the end of September, 1817, the three private schools were in operation.[12]:â11 The cornerstone of the first school house, near the corner of Bates Street and Congress Street in Detroit, was laid on September 24, 1817. Subscriptions amounting to $5,000 payable in instalments running over several years were obtained to carry on the work.[12]:â12 Of the total amount subscribed to start the work two-thirds came from Zion Masonic Lodge and its members.[15] In August 1818, a private Lancasterian school taught by Lemuel Shattuck was opened in the building.[12]:â12\n\n\nOn April 30, 1821, the Michigan Territory passed a new act changing materially the appearance and nature of the existing educational organization.[12]:â13 A board of trustees was appointed to oversee the corporation; the positions of president and vice president were eliminated, and Monteith and Richard were appointed to the board.[1] *University of Michigan* took the place of *Catholepistemiad Michigania* as the legal name of the corporation.\n\n\n\n![Painting of a rolling green landscape with trees with a row of white buildings in the background](image)*University of Michigan* (1855) Jasper Francis Cropsey\n### 1837â1900[edit]\n\n\nAfter the state of Michigan entered the Union in 1837, its constitution granted the university an unusual degree of autonomy as a âcoordinate branch of state government.â It delegated full powers over all university matters granted to its governing Board of Regents.[14] On June 3â5, the Board of Regents held its first meeting in Ann Arbor and formally accepted the proposal by the town to locate the university there.[1] The town of Ann Arbor had existed for only 13 years and had a population of about 2,000.[16] A grant of 40 acres (16Â ha), obtained through the Treaty of Fort Meigs,[17] formed the basis of the present Central Campus.[18]\n\n\nSince the founding period, the private sector has remained the primary provider of university financing to supplement tuition collected from students. Early benefactors of the university included businessman Dexter M. Ferry (donor of Ferry Field), Arthur Hill (regent, donor of Hill Auditorium), the Nichols family (regents, donors of the Nichols Arboretum), William E. Upjohn (donor of the Peony\nGarden), William P. Trowbridge, John S. Newberry, who funded the construction of Helen H. Newberry Residence, and Henry N. Walker, a politician who led a group of prominent Detroit businessmen to fund the Detroit Observatory. Clara Harrison Stranahan, a close friend of Scottish-American industrialist Andrew Carnegie, donated $25,000 to the university in 1895 as a memorial of her father, Seth Harrison. The Waterman Gymnasium was financed by donations from wealthy citizens and matched Joshua W. Waterman's pledge of $20,000. When opened, the total cost of the building was $61,876.49, to which private donors contributed $49,524.34.[12]:â67\n\n\n\n![](image)Alexander J. Davis's original University of Michigan designs featured the Gothic Revival style. Davis himself is generally credited with coining the term \"Collegiate Gothic.\"\nIn 1838, the Regents contracted with Alexander Jackson Davis, who according to Superintendent John Davis Pierce provided truly \"magnificent designs\" in the Gothic Revival style; but unfortunately the completion of them at that day would, as Pierce said, involve an expenditure of half a million dollars.[12]:â31 Although approving the designs, the tight budget of the fledgling university forced the Regents to ultimately abandon them and instead adopted a much less expensive plan.[19] The superintendent of construction on the first structure to be built for the university was Isaac Thompson, an associate of Davis.[20] Asa Gray was the first professor appointed to Michigan on July 17, 1837.[21] His position was also the first one devoted solely to botany at any educational institution in America.[22][23][24] The first classes in Ann Arbor were held in 1841, with six freshmen and a sophomore, taught by two professors. Eleven students graduated in the first commencement in 1845.[25]\n\n\n\n![](image)Andrew Dickson White, founder and first president of Cornell University and among the earliest benefactors of Michigan, joined the Michigan faculty in 1858. He made his lasting mark on the grounds of the university by enrolling students to plant elms along the walkways on The Diag, resembling the \"glorious elms\" of Yale.[26]\nThe years 1837â1850 disclosed serious weakness in the organization and working of the university. Regents of the university discovered that the organic act from which they derived their powers, made them too dependent upon the legislature. The subject was brought to the attention of the legislature more than once but without securing the desired action in order to achieve increased independence. By the late 1840s, the Regents achieved a strong position relative to collective bargaining with the legislature as the opinion was becoming common among capitalists, clergymen and intellectual elites, since by then the state derived significant tax revenue through them. Such a situation ultimately led to a change in the organic act of the university. Remodeled, the act, which was approved April 8, 1851, emancipated the university from legislative control that would have been injudicious and harmful. The office of Regent was changed from an appointed one to an elected one, and the office of President was created, with the Regents directed to select one. As Hinsdale argued, \"the independent position of the university has had much to do with its growth and prosperity. In fact, its larger growth may be dated from the time when the new sections began to take effect.\"[12]:â40\n\n\nMichigan was the first university in the West to pursue professional education, establishing its medical school in 1850, engineering courses in 1854, and a law school in 1859.[14] The university was among the first to introduce instruction in fields as diverse as zoology and botany, modern languages, modern history, American literature, pharmacy, dentistry, speech, journalism, teacher education, forestry, bacteriology, naval architecture, aeronautical engineering, computer engineering, and nuclear engineering.[14] In 1856, Michigan built the nation's first chemical laboratory.[27] That laboratory was the first structure on the North American continent that was designed and equipped solely for instruction in chemistry.[27] In 1869 Michigan opened the first university hospital in the country. James Burrill Angell, who served as the university's president from 1871 to 1909, expanded the curriculum to include professional studies in dentistry, architecture, engineering, government, and medicine.\n\n\nThe University of Michigan conferred the degree of Bachelor of Science in 1855, four years after the Lawrence Scientific School at Cambridge conferred the degree in 1851, for the first time in the United States, making Michigan the second institution in the country to confer the degree.[12]:â48 The degree of Bachelor of Philosophy was conferred for the first time in the university's history upon six students in 1870.[12]:â79 The degrees of Master of Philosophy and Doctor of Philosophy was first offered in 1875.[12]:â88\n\n\nMethods of instruction had also undergone important changes. The *seminar* method of study was first introduced into the university by Charles Kendall Adams in 1871â1872, making the university the first American institution to naturalize this product of the German soil.[28][12]:â71\n\n\nBy 1866, enrollment had increased to 1,205 students. Women were first admitted in 1870,[29] although Alice Robinson Boise Wood had become the first woman to attend classes (without matriculating) in 1866â7.[30] Among the early students in the School of Medicine was Jose Celso Barbosa, who in 1880 graduated as valedictorian and the first Puerto Rican to get a university degree in the United States. He returned to Puerto Rico to practice medicine and also served in high-ranking posts in the government.[31] Michigan was involved with the building of the Philippine education, legal, and public health systems during the era of the American colonization of the Philippines through the efforts of Michigan alumni that included Dean Conant Worcester and George A. Malcolm.[32]\n\n\nThroughout its history, Michigan has been one of the nation's largest universities, vying with the largest private universities such as Harvard University and Columbia University (then known as Columbia College) during the 19th and early 20th centuries, and then holding this position of national leadership until the emergence of the statewide public university systems in the post-WWII years.[14] By the turn of the 19th century, the university was the second largest in the United States after Harvard University.[33]\n\n\nDescendants of Massachusetts founding families made up a large portion of the university population in the 19th century; among them was Regent Charles Hebard, a lineal descendant of William Bradford, a founding father of Plymouth Colony.[12]:â204\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe Diag, ca. 1900\n\nFrom 1900 to 1920, the growth of higher education led the university to build numerous new facilities. The Martha Cook Building was constructed as an all-female residence in 1915 as the result of a gift from William Wilson Cook in honor of his mother, Martha Walford Cook.[34]\nCook planned to endow a professorship of law of corporations, but eventually made possible the development of the Law Quadrangle.[35] The five buildings comprising the Law Quadrangle were constructed during the decade of 1923â33 on two city blocks purchased by the university: Lawyers Club, Dormitory Wing, John P. Cook Dormitory, William W Cook Legal Research Library, and Hutchins Hall.[35] The buildings, in the Tudor Gothic style, recalled the quadrangles of the two English ancient universities Oxford and Cambridge.[35]\n\n\n\n![](image)Physicists George Uhlenbeck, Hendrik Kramers, and Samuel Goudsmit circa 1928 at Michigan.\n![](image)\n![](image)\nWest Engineering Building, 1905\n\nFrom 1915 to 1941, the physics department was led by Harrison M. Randall, who established the importance of theoretical colleagues. Oskar Klein, Samuel Goudsmit, George Uhlenbeck, Otto Laporte and David Dennison joined the physics faculty during this time. Theoretical physicist Wolfgang Pauli, who became known as one of the pioneers of quantum physics, held a visiting professorship at the university in 1931.[36] Other physicists with ties to the university include the inventor of the Race Track Synchrotron H. Richard Crane and Hendrik Kramers. The Michigan Summer Symposia in Theoretical Physics occurred from 1927 to 1941 and provided lectures from theorists, including Niels Bohr, Paul Dirac, Enrico Fermi, Werner Heisenberg, and others.[36] J. Robert Oppenheimer lectured on the \"General Quantum Theory of Transitions\" at the university in 1931.[36]\n\n\nIn August 1946, Rensis Likert and his team formed the Survey Research Center at the University of Michigan. This became the Institute for Social Research (ISR) in 1949 when Dorwin Cartwright moved the Group Dynamics Research Center, the first institute devoted explicitly to group dynamics, from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to the University of Michigan.\n\n\nThe University of Michigan has been the birthplace of some important academic movements, establishing the Michigan schools of thought and developing the Michigan Models in various fields. John Dewey, Charles Horton Cooley, George Herbert Mead, and Robert Ezra Park first met at Michigan. There, they would influence each other greatly.[37] In political science, Angus Campbell, Philip Converse, Warren Miller and Donald Stokes, proposed the Michigan model of voting.[38] In business administration, Michigan Business School developed the Michigan model of human resource management in 1984. \n\n\nShortly after the war, in 1947, the Regents appointed a War Memorial Committee to consider establishing a war memorial in honor of students and alumni who fell in World War II, and in 1948, approved a resolution to \"create a war memorial center to explore the ways and means by which the potentialities of atomic energy may become a beneficent influence in the life of man, to be known as the Phoenix Project of the University of Michigan\", leading to the world's first academic program in nuclear science and engineering.[39][14] The Memorial Phoenix Project was funded by over 25,000 private contributors by individuals and corporations, such as the Ford Motor Company.[40]\n\n\nDuring the 1960s, the university campus was the site of numerous protests against the Vietnam War and university administration. On March 24, 1965, a group of U-M faculty members and 3,000 students held the nation's first-ever faculty-led \"teach-in\" to protest against American policy in Southeast Asia.[41][42][43] In response to a series of sit-ins in 1966 by *Voice*, the campus political party of Students for a Democratic Society, U-M's administration banned sit-ins. In response, 1,500 students participated in a one-hour sit-in inside the Administration Building, now known as the LSA Building. In April 1968, following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., a group of several dozen black students occupied the Administration Building to demand that the university make public its three-year-old commitment as a federal contractor to affirmative action and to increase its efforts with respect to recruiting more African American students, faculty and staff. At that time there were no African American coaches, for instance, in the Intercollegiate Athletics Department. The university's Spectrum Center is the oldest collegiate LGBT student center in the U.S., pre-dating Penn's.[44]\n\n\nDue to concerns over the university's financial situation there have been suggestions for the complete separation of the university and state through privatization.[45][46] Even though the university is a public institution *de jure*, it has embraced funding models of a private university that emphasize tuition funding and raising funds from private donors.[47] Considering that \"the University of Michigan already has only minimal fiscal ties to the state,\" the legislature convened a panel in 2008 that recommended converting the University of Michigan from a public to a private institution.[48]\n\n\n\n### Historical links[edit]\n\n\n![](image)John Dewey, founder of the University of Chicago Laboratory School\nThe University of Michigan was the first attempt in the New World to build a modern university in the European sense. The institution was the clearest and strongest presentation that had yet been made of what, in this country, at once came to be called the \"Prussian ideas.\" It was a radically different approach to higher education; a complete civil system of education, in contradistinction to the ecclesiastical system made out of the colonial colleges. Michigan alumni and faculty members carried this newer concept of the university with them as they founded other institutions including Andrew Dixon White, a cofounder of Cornell University.[14] Cornell alumni David Starr Jordan and John Casper Branner passed the concept to Stanford University in the late 19th century.\n\n\nMichigan also has many historical links to other American universities through its graduates.\n\n\n\n* University of California: had its early planning based upon the University of Michigan.[49][50]\n* University of Chicago: Michigan alumnus Robert Ezra Park played a leading role in the development of the Chicago School of sociology. The University of Chicago Laboratory School was founded in 1896 by John Dewey and Calvin Brainerd Cady, who were members of the Michigan faculty.\n* Cornell University: had its Law School founded by Michigan alumni Charles Kendall Adams and Harry Burns Hutchins.\n* Harvard University: Michigan alumnus Edwin Francis Gay was the founding dean of the Harvard Business School from 1908 to 1919,[51] instrumental in the school's planning.\n* Johns Hopkins University: had its pharmacology department established by John Jacob Abel, an alumnus of Michigan.\n* Massachusetts Institute of Technology: had its Media Lab, the world's leading research laboratory, founded by Michigan alumnus Jerome Wiesner.\n* Northwestern University: Michigan alumnus Henry Wade Rogers was instrumental in transforming Northwestern from a small cluster of colleges into a major, nationally recognized university. His wife, Emma Winner Rogers, founded the Northwestern University Settlement Association.[52]\n* Tufts University: had its College of Civic Life founded by John Angelo DiBiaggio, an alumnus of Michigan.[53]\n* Wellesley College: Michigan alumna Alice Freeman Palmer, the President of Wellesley College from 1881 to 1887, \"transformed the fledgling school from one devoted to Christian domesticity into one of the nation's premier colleges for women.\"[54]\n* Yale University: had its residential college system co-organized by James Rowland Angell, a graduate of Michigan.[55] Michigan alumnus Henry Wade Rogers introduced the \"case system\" and the college degree requirement into the Yale Law School.\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\nThe Ann Arbor campus is divided into four main areas: the North, Central, Medical, and South campuses. The physical infrastructure includes more than 500 major buildings,[56] with a combined area of more than 37.48Â million square feet (860 acres; 3.482Â km2).[57] The Central and South Campus areas are contiguous, while the North Campus area is separated from them, primarily by the Huron River.[58] There is also leased space in buildings scattered throughout the city, many occupied by organizations affiliated with the University of Michigan Health System. An East Medical Campus was developed on Plymouth Road, with several university-owned buildings for outpatient care, diagnostics, and outpatient surgery.[59]\n\n\nIn addition to the U-M Golf Course on South Campus, the university operates a second golf course on Geddes Road called Radrick Farms Golf Course. The golf course is only open to faculty, staff and alumni.[60] Another off-campus facility is the Inglis House, which the university has owned since the 1950s. The Inglis House is a 10,000-square-foot (930Â m2) mansion used to hold various social events, including meetings of the Board of Regents, and to host visiting dignitaries.[61] The university also operates a large office building called Wolverine Tower in southern Ann Arbor near Briarwood Mall. Another major facility is the Matthaei Botanical Gardens, which is located on the eastern outskirts of Ann Arbor.[62]\n\n\nAll four campus areas are connected by bus services, the majority of which connect the North and Central campuses. There is a shuttle service connecting the University Hospital, which lies between North and Central campuses, with other medical facilities throughout northeastern Ann Arbor.[63]\n\n\nThe 2021 state budget boosted University of Michigan funding by 5% across all 3 campuses.[64]\n\n\nThe university has also seen increases in their sustainability efforts through climate, energy, food systems, water, and construction.[65]\n\n\n\n### Central Campus[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: University of Michigan Central Campus Historic District\n\nCentral Campus was the original location of U-M when it moved to Ann Arbor in 1837. It originally had a school and dormitory building (where Mason Hall now stands) and several houses for professors on 40 acres (16Â ha) of land bounded by North University Avenue, South University Avenue, East University Avenue, and State Street. The President's House, located on South University Avenue, is the oldest building on campus as well as the only surviving building from the original 40-acre (16Â ha) campus.[18] Because Ann Arbor and Central Campus developed simultaneously, there is no distinct boundary between the city and university, and some areas contain a mixture of private and university buildings.[66] Residence halls located on Central Campus are split up into two groups: the Hill Neighborhood and Central Campus.[67]\n\n\nCentral Campus is the location of the College of Literature, Science and the Arts, and is immediately adjacent to the medical campus. Most of the graduate and professional schools, including the Ross School of Business, the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy, the Law School and the School of Dentistry, are on Central Campus. Two prominent libraries, the Harlan Hatcher Graduate Library and the Shapiro Undergraduate Library (which are connected by a skywalk), are also on Central Campus.[68] as well as museums housing collections in archaeology, anthropology, paleontology, zoology, dentistry and art. Ten of the buildings on Central Campus were designed by Detroit-based architect Albert Kahn between 1904 and 1936 including Burton Memorial Tower and Hill Auditorium.[69]\n\n\n\n### North Campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Earl V. Moore Building on North Campus\nNorth Campus is the most contiguous campus, built independently from the city on a large plot of farmlandâapproximately 800 acres (3.2Â km2)âthat the university bought in 1952.[70] It is newer than Central Campus, and thus has more modernist architecture, whereas most Central Campus buildings are classical or Collegiate Gothic in style. The architect Eero Saarinen, based in Birmingham, Michigan, created one of the early master plans for North Campus and designed several of its buildings in the 1950s, including the Earl V. Moore School of Music Building.[71] North and Central Campuses each have unique bell towers that reflect the predominant architectural styles of their surroundings. Each of the bell towers houses a grand carillon, 2 of only 57 globally. The North Campus tower is called Lurie Tower.[72] The University of Michigan's largest residence hall, Bursley Hall, is located on North Campus.[67]\n\n\nNorth Campus houses the College of Engineering, the School of Music, Theatre & Dance, the Stamps School of Art & Design, the Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning, and an annex of the School of Information.[73] The campus is served by the Duderstadt Center, which houses the Art, Architecture and Engineering Library. The Duderstadt Center also contains multiple computer labs, video editing studios, electronic music studios, an audio studio, a video studio, multimedia workspaces, and a 3D virtual reality room.[74] Other libraries located on North Campus include the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library and the Bentley Historical Library.\n\n\n\n### South Campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)University of Michigan Golf Course was designed by Scottish golf course architect Alister MacKenzie and opened in 1931.\nSouth Campus is the site for the athletic programs, including major sports facilities such as Michigan Stadium, Crisler Center, and Yost Ice Arena. South Campus is also the site of the Buhr library storage facility, Revelli Hall, home of the Michigan Marching Band, the Institute for Continuing Legal Education,[75] and the Student Theatre Arts Complex, which provides shop and rehearsal space for student theatre groups.[76] The university's departments of public safety and transportation services offices are located on South Campus.[75]\n\n\nU-M's golf course is located south of Michigan Stadium and Crisler Center. It was designed in the late 1920s by Alister MacKenzie, the designer of Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia, home of the Masters Tournament.[77] The course opened to the public in the spring of 1931. The University of Michigan Golf Course was included in a listing of top holes designed by what *Sports Illustrated* calls \"golf's greatest course architect\". The U-M Golf Course's signature No. 6 holeâa 310-yard (280Â m) par 4, which plays from an elevated tee to a two-tiered, kidney-shaped green protected by four bunkersâis the second hole on the Alister MacKenzie Dream 18 as selected by a five-person panel that includes three-time Masters champion Nick Faldo and golf course architect Tom Doak. The listing of \"the best holes ever designed by Augusta National architect Alister MacKenzie\" is featured in SI's Golf Plus special edition previewing the Masters on April 4, 2006.[78]\n\n\n\n## Organization and administration[edit]\n\n\nSee also: President of the University of Michigan and Board of Regents of the University of Michigan\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **College/school** | **Year founded**[79] |\n| Literature, Science, and the Arts | 1841\n |\n| Medicine | 1850\n |\n| Engineering | 1854\n |\n| Law | 1859\n |\n| Dentistry | 1875\n |\n| Pharmacy | 1876\n |\n| Music, Theatre & Dance | 1880\n |\n| Nursing | 1893\n |\n| Architecture & Urban Planning | 1906\n |\n| Graduate Studies | 1912\n |\n| Government | 1914\n |\n| Education | 1921\n |\n| Business | 1924\n |\n| Environment and Sustainability | 1927\n |\n| Public Health | 1941\n |\n| Social Work | 1951\n |\n| Information | 1969\n |\n| Art & Design | 1974\n |\n| Kinesiology | 1984\n |\n\n\nThe University of Michigan consists of a flagship campus in Ann Arbor, with two regional campuses in Dearborn and Flint. The Board of Regents, which governs the university and was established by the Organic Act of March 18, 1837, consists of eight members elected at large in biennial state elections[80] for overlapping eight-year terms.[81][82] Between the establishment of the University of Michigan in 1837 and 1850, the Board of Regents ran the university directly; although they were, by law, supposed to appoint a Chancellor to administer the university, they never did. Instead, a rotating roster of professors carried out the day-to-day administration duties.[83]\n\n\nThe President of the University of Michigan is the principal executive officer of the university. The office was created by the Michigan Constitution of 1850, which also specified that the president was to be appointed by the Regents of the University of Michigan and preside at their meetings, but without a vote.[84] Today, the president's office is at the Ann Arbor campus, and the president has the privilege of living in the President's House, the university's oldest building.[85] Mark Schlissel was president from July 2014 to January 2022, when he was fired by the board after an investigation determined he \"may have been involved in an inappropriate relationship with an employee of the university\".[86]\n\n\n\n![](image)Samuel Trask Dana Building (West Medical Building) houses the School for Environment and Sustainability\nThere are thirteen undergraduate schools and colleges.[87] By enrollment, the three largest undergraduate units are the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, the College of Engineering, and the Ross School of Business.[88] At the graduate level, the Rackham Graduate School serves as the central administrative unit of graduate education at the university.[89] There are 18 graduate schools and colleges. Professional degrees are conferred by the Schools of Architecture, Public Health, Dentistry, Law, Medicine, Urban Planning and Pharmacy.[88] The Medical School is partnered with the University of Michigan Health System, which comprises the university's three hospitals, dozens of outpatient clinics, and many centers for medical care, research, and education.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Student government[edit]\n\n\nHoused in the Michigan Union, the Central Student Government (CSG) is the central student government of the university. With representatives from each of the university's colleges and schools, including graduate students, CSG represents students and manages student funds on the campus. CSG is a 501(c)(3) organization, independent from the University of Michigan.[90] In recent years CSG has organized Airbus, a transportation service between campus and the Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport, and has led the university's efforts to register its student population to vote, with its Voice Your Vote Commission (VYV) registering 10,000 students in 2004. VYV also works to improve access to non-partisan voting-related information and increase student voter turnout.[91] CSG was successful at reviving Homecoming activities, including a carnival and parade, for students after a roughly eleven-year absence in October 2007,[92] and during the 2013â14 school year, was instrumental in persuading the university to rescind an unpopular change in student football seating policy at Michigan Stadium.[93] In 2017, CSG successfully petitioned the Ann Arbor City Council to create a Student Advisory Council to give student input into Ann Arbor city affairs.[94]\n\n\nThere are student governance bodies in each college and school, independent of Central Student Government. Undergraduate students in the LS&A are represented by the LS&A Student Government (LSA SG).[95] Engineering Student Government (ESG) manages undergraduate student government affairs for the College of Engineering. Graduate students enrolled in the Rackham Graduate School are represented by the Rackham Student Government (RSG), and law students are represented by the Law School Student Senate (LSSS) as is each other college with its own respective government. In addition, the students who live in the residence halls are represented by the University of Michigan Residence Halls Association (RHA), which contains the third most constituents after CSG and LSA SG.[96]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nWilliam W. Cook Legal Research Library and other buildings comprising the Law Quadrangle were built during 1923â33 and then donated to the university by William Wilson Cook. It was the university's most significant private gift at the time.\n\nA longstanding goal of the student government is to create a student-designated seat on the Board of Regents, the university's governing body.[97] Such a designation would achieve parity with other Big Ten schools that have student regents. In 2000, students Nick Waun and Scott Trudeau ran for the board on the statewide ballot as third-party nominees. Waun ran for a second time in 2002, along with Matt Petering and Susan Fawcett.[98] Although none of these campaigns has been successful, a poll conducted by the State of Michigan in 1998 concluded that a majority of Michigan voters would approve of such a position if the measure were put before them.[97] A change to the board's makeup would require amending the Michigan Constitution.[99]\n\n\n\n### Finances[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2019[update], U-M's financial endowment (the \"University Endowment Fund\") was valued at $12.4 billion.[100]\n\n\nIn the 1980s, the university received increased grants for research in the social and physical sciences. During the 1980s and 1990s, the university devoted substantial resources to renovating its massive hospital complex and improving the academic facilities on the North Campus. In the early 2000s, Michigan faced declining state funding due to state budget shortfalls. In fact, the university did not receive direct state appropriations until 1867, and for most of its history, state support has been limited.[14] The state's annual contribution to the school's operating budget was less than 6%. In 2011 less than 5% of its support comes from state appropriations, a number continued to drop.[14]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Academic rankings |\n| --- |\n| National |\n| *ARWU*[101] | 18 |\n| *Forbes*[102] | 23 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[103] | 21 |\n| *Washington Monthly*[104] | 23 |\n| *WSJ*/*College Pulse*[105] | 28 |\n| Global |\n| *ARWU*[106] | 26 |\n| *QS*[107] | 33 |\n| *THE*[108] | 23 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[109] | 19 |\n\n\nThe University of Michigan is a large, four-year, residential research university accredited by the Higher Learning Commission.[110][111][112] The four-year, full-time undergraduate program comprises the majority of enrollments and emphasizes instruction in the arts, sciences, and professions with a high level of coexistence between graduate and undergraduate programs. The university has \"very high\" research activity and the comprehensive graduate program offers doctoral degrees in the humanities, social sciences, and STEM fields as well as professional degrees in medicine, law, and dentistry.[110] U-M has been included on Richard Moll's list of Public Ivies.[113] With over 200 undergraduate majors, and 100 doctoral and 90 master's programs,[114] U-M conferred 6,490 undergraduate degrees, 4,951 graduate degrees, and 709 first professional degrees in 2011â2012.[115] Its most popular undergraduate majors, by 2021 graduates, were:[116]\n\n\n\nComputer and Information Sciences (874)\nBusiness Administration and Management (610)\nEconomics (542)\nBehavioral Neuroscience (319)\nMechanical Engineering (316)\nExperimental Psychology (312)\nThe 2021 *U.S.

the founding members (in the year 1900) of the Association of American Universities. With over 6,200 faculty members, 73 of whom are members of the National Academy and 471 of whom hold an endowed chair in their discipline,[133] the university manages one of the largest annual collegiate research budgets of any university in the United States. According to the National Science Foundation, Michigan spent $1.639 billion on research and development in 2021, ranking it 3rd in the nation.[134] This figure totaled over $1 billion in 2009.[135] The Medical School spent the most at over $445 million, while the College of Engineering was second at more than $160 million.[135] U-M also has a technology transfer office, which is the university conduit between laboratory research and corporate commercialization interests.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Thomas Henry Simpson Memorial Institute for Medical Research was constructed in 1924 as the result of a donation from the widow of iron magnate Thomas H. Simpson, in memory of her late husband, who had died of pernicious anemia\nIn 2009, U-M signed an agreement to purchase a facility formerly owned by Pfizer. The acquisition includes over 170 acres (0.69Â km2) of property, and 30 major buildings comprising roughly 1,600,000 square feet (150,000Â m2) of wet laboratory space, and 400,000 square feet (37,000Â m2) of administrative space. At the time of the agreement, the university's intentions for the space were not fully articulated, but the expectation was that the new space would allow the university to ramp up its research and ultimately employ in excess of 2,000 people.[136]\n\n\nThe university is also a major contributor to the medical field with the EKG[137] and the gastroscope.[138] The university's 13,000-acre (53Â km2) biological station in the Northern Lower Peninsula of Michigan is one of only 47 Biosphere Reserves in the United States.[139]\n\n\nIn the mid-1960s U-M researchers worked with IBM to develop a new virtual memory architectural model[140] that model became part of IBM's Model 360/67 mainframe computer (the 360/67 was initially dubbed the 360/65M where the \"M\" stood for Michigan).[141] The Michigan Terminal System (MTS), an early time-sharing computer operating system developed at U-M, was the first system outside of IBM to use the 360/67's virtual memory features.[142]\n\n\n\n\n\n*R&D statistics, by year*[143][144][145][146]\n|  | TotalResearchx $1000 | NationalRank | FederalResearchx $1000 | NationalRank | NationalAcademyMembers | NationalRank\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2017\n | 1,434,535\n | 2\n | 822,436\n | 3\n | 118\n | 9\n |\n| 2016\n | 1,357,228\n | 2\n | 780,080\n | 3\n | 113\n | 12\n |\n| 2015\n | 1,300,340\n | 2\n | 728,712\n | 3\n | 108\n | 13\n |\n| 2014\n | 1,279,603\n | 2\n | 733,779\n | 3\n | 106\n | 13\n |\n\n\nU-M is home to the National Election Studies and the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index. The Correlates of War project, also located at U-M, is an accumulation of scientific knowledge about war. The university is also home to major research centers in optics, reconfigurable manufacturing systems, wireless integrated microsystems, and social sciences. The University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute and the Life Sciences Institute are located at the university. The Institute for Social Research (ISR), the nation's longest-standing laboratory for interdisciplinary research in the social sciences,[147] is home to the Survey Research Center, Research Center for Group Dynamics, Center for Political Studies, Population Studies Center, and Inter-Consortium for Political and Social Research. Undergraduate students are able to participate in various research projects through the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP) as well as the UROP/Creative-Programs.[148]\n\n\nThe U-M library system comprises nineteen individual libraries with twenty-four separate collectionsâroughly 13.3 million volumes as of 2012.[149] U-M was the original home of the JSTOR database, which contains about 750,000 digitized pages from the entire pre-1990 backfile of ten journals of history and economics, and has initiated a book digitization program in collaboration with Google.[150] The University of Michigan Press is also a part of the U-M library system.\n\n\nIn the late 1960s U-M, together with Michigan State University and Wayne State University, founded the Merit Network, one of the first university computer networks.[151] The Merit Network was then and remains today administratively hosted by U-M. Another major contribution took place in 1987 when a proposal submitted by the Merit Network together with its partners IBM, MCI, and the State of Michigan won a national competition to upgrade and expand the National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET) backbone from 56,000 to 1.5 million, and later to 45 million bits per second.[152] In 2006, U-M joined with Michigan State University and Wayne State University to create the University Research Corridor. This effort was undertaken to highlight the capabilities of the state's three leading research institutions and drive the transformation of Michigan's economy.[153] The three universities are electronically interconnected via the Michigan LambdaRail (MiLR, pronounced 'MY-lar'), a high-speed data network providing 10 Gbit/s connections between the three university campuses and other national and international network connection points in Chicago.[154]\n\n\nIn May 2021, the university announced plans to cut carbon emissions from its campuses. The plan covers all of its operations and goals include removing emissions from direct, on-campus sources by 2040.[155]\n\n\n\n## Student body[edit]\n\n\n### Undergraduate admissions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Undergraduate admissions statistics |\n| --- |\n| 2021 enteringclass[156]\n\n\n---\n\n |\n| Admit rate | 19.5%(16,235 out of 83,029) |\n| Yield rate | 46.4% |\n| Test scores middle 50% |\n| SAT EBRW | 680â760 |\n| SAT Math | 710â790 |\n| ACT Composite | 32â35 |\n| High school GPA |\n| Average | 3.90 |\n|  |\n\n\nThe requirements for admission to the freshman class were first published in August 1841, with fluency in ancient languages, such as Latin and Greek, being among the many requirements.[12]:â33 Candidates for admission to the freshman class were examined in English grammar, geography, arithmetic, algebra, Virgil, Cicero's Select Orations, Jacob's or Felton's Greek Reader, Andrews and Stoddard's Latin Grammar, and Sophocles's Greek Grammar. In 1851, the university dropped the requirement for students who did not wish to pursue the usual collegiate course embracing the ancient languages, permitting their admission without examination in such languages.[12]:â44 This provision may be considered a prelude to scientific education.\n\n\nRequirements for admission varied from department to department in the early days, and admissions were mostly given by referral. Candidates were required to do no more than satisfying professors on such inquiry as professors saw fit to make of their ability to do the work to obtain admission to the university. Such a practice was deemed flawed, eventually leading to corruption. In 1863, a rigid generalized entrance examination was imposed, creating one standard of qualifications for admission to all the departments, academical and professional.[12]:â79 The early administration praised the then-new practice for its role in strengthening admission to the university.[12]:â44 The entrance examination imposed in 1863 had played a significant role in the admission process during the 19th century until the emergence of the nationwide standardized tests, which were not offered until 1900.\n\n\nAdmission is based on academic prowess, extracurricular activities, and personal qualities. *U.S. News & World Report* rates Michigan \"Most Selective\"[9] and The Princeton Review rates its admissions selectivity of 96 out of 99.[157] Admissions are characterized as \"more selective, lower transfer-in\" according to the Carnegie Classification.[110][158] The university is need-blind for domestic applicants.[159]\n\n\nMichigan received over 83,000 applications for a place in the 2021â22 freshman class, making it one of the most applied-to universities in the United States.[158][160] In recent years, annual numbers of applications for freshman admission have exceeded 83,000. Around 16,000 students are offered admission annually, with a target freshman class of more than 7,000 students.[158] Students come from all 50 U.S. states and nearly 100 countries.[158] In academic year 2019â20 full-time undergraduate students made up about 97 percent of the undergraduate student body, with a first-time student retention rate of almost 97 percent.[156]\n\n\nIn 2003, two lawsuits involving U-M's affirmative action admissions policy reached the U.S. Supreme Court (*Grutter v. Bollinger* and *Gratz v. Bollinger*). President George W. Bush publicly opposed the policy before the court issued a ruling.[161] The court found that race may be considered as a factor in university admissions in all public universities and private universities that accept federal funding, but it ruled that a point system was unconstitutional. In the first case, the court upheld the Law School admissions policy, while in the second it ruled against the university's undergraduate admissions policy.[*citation needed*] The debate continued because in November 2006, Michigan voters passed Proposal 2, banning most affirmative action in university admissions. Under that law, race, gender, and national origin can no longer be considered in admissions.[162] U-M and other organizations were granted a stay from implementation of the law soon after that referendum. This allowed time for proponents of affirmative action to decide legal and constitutional options in response to the initiative results. In April 2014, the Supreme Court ruled in *Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action* that Proposal 2 did not violate the U.S. Constitution. The admissions office states that it will attempt to achieve a diverse student body by looking at other factors, such as whether the student attended a disadvantaged school, and the level of education of the student's parents.[162]\n\n\n\n### Enrollment[edit]\n\n\n\n\nStudent body composition as of May 2, 2022\n| Race and ethnicity[163] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| White | 55%\n | 55 |\n| Asian | 16%\n | 16 |\n| Other[a] | 10%\n | 10 |\n| Hispanic | 7%\n | 7 |\n| Foreign national | 7%\n | 7 |\n| Black | 5%\n | 5 |\n| Economic diversity |\n| Low-income[b] | 18%\n | 18 |\n| Affluent[c] | 82%\n | 82 |\n\n\nIn Fall 2016, the university had an enrollment of 44,718 students: 28,983 undergraduate students, 12,565 graduate students and 2,665 first professional students[8][88] in a total of 600 academic programs. Of all students, 37,954 (84.9%) are U.S. citizens or permanent residents and 6,764 (15.1%) are international students.[8]\n\n\nIn 2014, undergraduates were enrolled in 12 schools or colleges: About 61 percent in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts; 21 percent in the College of Engineering; 5.3 percent in the Ross School of Business; 3.3 percent in the School of Kinesiology; 2.7 percent in the School of Music, Theatre & Dance; and 2 percent in the School of Nursing. Small numbers of undergraduates were enrolled in the colleges or schools of Art & Design, Architecture & Urban Planning, Dentistry, Education, Pharmacy, and Public Policy.[88] In 2014, the School of Information opened to undergraduates, with the new Bachelor of Science in Information degree. Among undergraduates, 70 percent graduate with a bachelor's degree within four years, 86 percent graduate within five years and 88 percent graduating within six years.[164]\n\n\n\n![](image)West Hall at the Southeast corner of the Diag\nOf the university's 12,714 non-professional graduate students, 5,367 are seeking academic doctorates and 6,821 are seeking master's degrees. The largest number of master's degree students are enrolled in the Ross School of Business (1,812 students seeking MBA or Master of Accounting degrees) and the College of Engineering (1,456 students seeking M.S. or M.Eng. degrees). The largest number of doctoral students are enrolled in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (2,076) and College of Engineering (1,496). While the majority of U-M's graduate degree-granting schools and colleges have both undergraduate and graduate students, a few schools only issue graduate degrees. Presently, the School for Environment and Sustainability, School of Public Health, and School of Social Work only have graduate students.[88]\n\n\nIn Fall 2014, 3,411 Michigan students were enrolled in U-M's professional schools: the School of Dentistry (628 students), Law School (1,047 students), Medical School (1,300 students), and College of Pharmacy (436 students).[88]\n\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\n### Residential life[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University of Michigan Housing\n\n![Law Quadrangle](image)Law Quadrangle, constructed during the decade of 1923â33, was designed by York and Sawyer in the Tudor style and recalled the quadrangles of two ancient English universities, Oxford and Cambridge.\nThe University of Michigan's campus housing system can accommodate approximately 10,000 students, or nearly 25 percent of the total student population at the university.[165] The residence halls are located in three distinct geographic areas on campus: Central Campus, Hill Area (between Central Campus and the University of Michigan Medical Center) and North Campus. Family housing is located on North Campus and mainly serves graduate students. The largest residence hall has a capacity of 1,270 students,[166] while the smallest accommodates 25 residents.[167] A majority of upper-division and graduate students live in off-campus apartments, houses, and cooperatives, with the largest concentrations in the Central and South Campus areas.\n\n\n\n![](image)Statue of Portia, above the front entrance to the Martha Cook Residence Hall\n![](image)Lawyers Club Dining Hall\nThe residential system has a number of \"living-learning communities\" where academic activities and residential life are combined. These communities focus on areas such as research through the Michigan Research and Discovery Scholars, medical sciences, community service and the German language.[168] The Michigan Research and Discovery Scholars and the Women in Science and Engineering Residence Program are housed in Mosher-Jordan Hall. The Residential College (RC), a living-learning community that is a division of the College of Literature, Science and the Arts, also has its principal instructional space in East Quad. The Michigan Community Scholars Program, dedicated to civic engagement, community service learning and intercultural understanding and dialogue, is located in West Quad.[169] The Lloyd Hall Scholars Program (LHSP) is located in Alice Lloyd Hall. The Health Sciences Scholars Program (HSSP) is located in Couzens Hall. The North Quad complex houses two additional living-learning communities: the Global Scholars Program[170] and the Max Kade German Program.[171] It is \"technology-rich,\" and houses communication-related programs, including the School of Information, the Department of Communication Studies, and the Department of Screen Arts and Cultures.[172][173] North Quad is also home to services such as the Language Resource Center and the Sweetland Center for Writing.[174]\n\n\n\n![](image)Betsy Barbour Residence Hall, one of three all-female residence halls on campus, was designed by Albert Kahn in the English Georgian style.\nThe residential system also has a number of \"theme communities\" where students have the opportunity to be surrounded by students in a residential hall who share similar interests. These communities focus on global leadership, the college transition experience, and internationalism.[175] The Adelia Cheever Program is housed in the Helen Newberry House.[176] The First Year Experience is housed in the Baits II Houses and Markley Hall along with portions of all other buildings with the exception of North Quad, Northwood, and Stockwell Hall.[177] The Sophomore Experience is housed in Stockwell Hall and the Transfer Year Experience is housed in Northwood III.[178][179] The newly organized International Impact program is housed in North Quad.[180]\n\n\n\n![](image)Stockwell Residence Hall\n### Groups and activities[edit]\n\n\nThe university lists 1,438 student organizations, including Omega Omega Omega (OOO), the nation's first mental health fraternity.[181][182] The student body is politically engaged, though, with 96% stating they intended to vote in the 2020 election. It is largely progressive, with 43% identifying as very liberal, 33% as somewhat liberal, and 13% moderate. 11% identified as conservative or very conservative.[183] With a history of student activism, some of the most visible groups include those dedicated to causes such as civil rights and labor rights, such as local chapters of Students for a Democratic Society and United Students Against Sweatshops. Conservative groups also organize, such as the Young Americans for Freedom.[184]\n\n\n\n![](image)Michigan Union, an Art Deco building constructed on land wholly owned by the student society in 1917, was designed by Michigan alumni Irving Kane Pond and Allen Bartlit Pond.\nThere are also several engineering projects teams, including the University of Michigan Solar Car Team, which has placed first in the North American Solar Challenge six times and third in the World Solar Challenge four times.[185] Michigan Interactive Investments,[186] the TAMID Israel Investment Group, and the Michigan Economics Society[187] are also affiliated with the university.\n\n\nThe university also showcases many community service organizations and charitable projects, including Foundation for International Medical Relief of Children, Dance Marathon at the University of Michigan,[188] The Detroit Partnership, Relay For Life, U-M Stars for the Make-A-Wish Foundation, InnoWorks at the University of Michigan, SERVE, Letters to Success, PROVIDES, Circle K, Habitat for Humanity,[189] and Ann Arbor Reaching Out. Intramural sports are popular, and there are recreation facilities for each of the three campuses.[190]\n\n\nFraternities and sororities play a role in the university's social life; approximately seven percent of undergraduate men and 16% of undergraduate women are active in the Greek system.[191] Four different Greek councilsâthe Interfraternity Council, Multicultural Greek Council, National Pan-Hellenic Council, and Panhellenic Associationârepresent most Greek organizations. Each council has a different recruitment process.[192]\n\n\nThe Michigan Union and Michigan League are student activity centers located on Central Campus; Pierpont Commons is on North Campus. The Michigan Union houses a majority of student groups, including the student government. The William Monroe Trotter House, located east of Central Campus, is a multicultural student center operated by the university's Office of Multi-Ethnic Student Affairs.[193] The University Activities Center (UAC) is a student-run programming organization and is composed of 14 committees.[194] Each group involves students in the planning and execution of a variety of events both on and off campus.\n\n\n\n![](image)Delta Sigma Delta, the first dental fraternity in the world\nThe Michigan Marching Band, composed of more than 350 students from almost all of U-M's schools,[195] is the university's marching band. Over 125 years old (with a first performance in 1897),[196] the band performs at every home football game and travels to at least one away game a year. The student-run and led University of Michigan Pops Orchestra is another musical ensemble that attracts students from all academic backgrounds. It performs regularly in the Michigan Theater. The University of Michigan Men's Glee Club, founded in 1859 and the second oldest such group in the country, is a men's chorus with over 100 members.[197] Its eight-member subset a cappella group, the University of Michigan Friars, which was founded in 1955, is the oldest currently running *a cappella* group on campus.[198] The University of Michigan is also home to over twenty other a cappella groups, including Amazin' Blue, The Michigan G-Men, and Compulsive Lyres, all of which have competed at the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella (ICCA) finals in New York City. Compulsive Lyres are the first and only group from Michigan to claim an ICCA title, having won in 2002.[199] The Michigan G-Men are one of only six groups in the country to compete at ICCA finals four times, one of only two TTBB ensembles to do so, and placed third at the competition in 2015.[200] Amazin' Blue placed fourth at ICCA finals in 2017. In 2020, The A Cappella Archive ranked The Michigan G-Men and Amazin' Blue at #7 and #13, respectively, out of all groups that have ever competed in ICCA.[201]\n\n\n\n![](image)Phi Delta Phi, the oldest legal organization in continuous existence in the United States.\nNational honor societies such as Phi Beta Kappa, Phi Kappa Phi, and Tau Beta Pi have chapters at U-M.[202] Degrees \"with Highest Distinction\" are recommended to students who rank in the top 3% of their class, \"with High Distinction\" to the next 7%, and \"with Distinction\" to the next 15%. Students earning a minimum overall GPA of 3.4 who have demonstrated high academic achievement and capacity for independent work may be recommended for a degree \"with Highest Honors\", \"with High Honors\", or \"with Honors.\"[202] Those students who earn all A's for two or more consecutive terms in a calendar year are recognized as James B. Angell Scholars and are invited to attend the annual Honors Convocation, an event which recognizes undergraduate students with distinguished academic achievements.[202]\n\n\n\n![](image)The archway to the Law Quadrangle\nThe University of Michigan has over 380 cultural and ethnic student organizations on campus.[203] There are organizations for almost every culture from the Arab Student Association to Persian Student Association[204] to African Students Association[205] to even the Egyptian Student Association.[206] These organizations hope to promote various aspects of their culture along with raising political and social awareness around campus by hosting an assortment of events throughout the school year. These clubs also help students make this large University into a smaller community to help find people with similar interests and backgrounds.\n\n\n\n### Collegiate secret societies[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Michigan hosts three secret societies: Michigauma, Adara, and the Vulcans. Michigauma and Adara were once under the umbrella group \"The Tower Society\", the name referring to their historical locations in the Michigan Union tower. Michigauma was all-male while Adara was all-female, although both later became co-ed.\n\n\n\n* Michigauma, more recently known as the Order of Angell, was formed in 1902 by a group of seniors in coordination with University president James Burrill Angell. The group disbanded itself in 2021 due to public concerns about elitism and the society's history. The group was granted a lease for the top floor of the Michigan Union tower in 1932, which they referred to as the \"tomb,\" but the society vacated the space in 2000. Until more recent reforms, the group's rituals were inspired by the culture of Native Americans.[207] Some factions on campus identified Michigauma as a secret society, but many disputed that characterization, as its member list has been published some years in *The Michigan Daily* and the *Michiganensian*, and online since 2006 reforms.\n* Adara, known as Phoenix, was formed in the late 1970s by women leaders on campus and disbanded itself in 2021 amid campus criticisms of secret societies.[208] In the early 1980s they joined the tower society and occupied the sixth floor of the tower just below Michigamua.\n* Vulcans, occupied the fifth floor of the Union tower though were not formally a part of the tower society. They draw their heritage from the Roman god Vulcan. The group which used to do its tapping publicly is known for its long black robes and for its financial contributions of the College of Engineering.\n\n\n### Media and publications[edit]\n\n\nSeveral academic journals are published at the university:\n\n\n\n* The Law School publishes *Michigan Law Review* and six other law journals: The *Michigan Journal of Environmental and Administrative Law*, *University of Michigan Journal of Law Reform*, *Michigan Journal of Race & Law*, *Michigan Telecommunications and Technology Law Review*, *Michigan Journal of International Law*, and *Michigan Journal of Gender and Law*.[209]\n* The Ross School of Business publishes the *Michigan Journal of Business*.\n* Several undergraduate journals are also published at the university, including the *Michigan Journal of Political Science*, *Michigan Journal of History*, *University of Michigan Undergraduate Research Journal*, the *Michigan Journal of International Affairs*, and the *Michigan Journal of Asian Studies*.\n\n\nThe student newspaper is *The Michigan Daily*, founded in 1890 and editorially and financially independent of the university. *The Daily* is published five days a week during academic year, and weekly from May to August. The yearbook is the *Michiganensian*, founded in 1896. Other student publications at the university include the conservative *The Michigan Review* and the progressive *Michigan Independent*. The humor publication *Gargoyle Humor Magazine* is also published by Michigan students.\n\n\nWCBN-FM (88.3 FM) is the student-run college radio station which plays in freeform format. WOLV-TV is the student-run television station that is primarily shown on the university's cable television system. WJJX was previously the school's student-run radio station. A carrier current station, it was launched in 1953.[210]\n\n\n\n### Safety[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Michigan Division of Public Safety and Security (DPSS) is responsible for law enforcement and safety on the main campus. The Division of Public Safety leadership team is made up of one executive director, three division deputy directors, three police chiefs and four directors. In addition, the team is also joined by two program managers and an executive assistant.[211]\n\n\nThe University of Michigan Police Department (UMPD) is a full-service community-oriented law enforcement agency under the DPSS. Its police officers are licensed by the Michigan Commission on Law Enforcement Standards (MCOLES), and have full authority to investigate, search, arrest and use reasonable force, if necessary, to protect people and property under Michigan law and the U-M Regents' Ordinance.[212] The Special Victims Unit (SVU) of the U-M Police Department (UMPD) assists those who have experienced interpersonal violence, such as sexual assault, intimate partner violence, dating violence, stalking or child abuse.[213]\n\n\nViolent crime is rare on the campus though a few of the cases have been notorious including Theodore Kaczynski's attempted murder of professor James V. McConnell and research assistant Nicklaus Suino in 1985. Kaczynski, also known as the Unabomber, graduated from Michigan with his PhD in 1967.\n\n\nA radical left-wing militant organization Weather Underground was founded at the university in 1969.[214] It was later designated a domestic terrorist group by the FBI.[215]\n\n\nIn 2014, the University of Michigan was named one of 55 higher education institutions under investigation by the Office of Civil Rights \"for possible violations of federal law over the handling of sexual violence and harassment complaints.\" President Barack Obama's White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault was organized for such investigations.[216] Seven years later, in 2021, the university attracted national attention when a report commissioned by the university was released that detailed an investigation into sexual assault allegations against doctor Robert Anderson who reportedly abused at least 950 university students, many of whom were athletes, from 1966 to 2003.[217] Several football players from that time say legendary football coach Bo Schembechler ignored and enabled the abuse and told players to \"toughen up\" after being molested.[218] Schembechler reportedly punched his then 10-year-old son Matthew after he reported abuse by Anderson.[219] Following the exposure of a similar history of abuse at Ohio State University, male survivors of both Anderson at Michigan and Strauss at Ohio State spoke out to combat sexual abuse.[220] The University of Michigan settled with the survivors for $490 million.[221]\n\n\n\n## Athletics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Michigan Wolverines\n\n![](image)Burgee of University of Michigan\nThe University of Michigan's sports teams are called the Wolverines. They participate in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision and in the Big Ten Conference in all sports except women's water polo, which is a member of the Collegiate Water Polo Association. U-M boasts 27 varsity sports, including 13 men's teams and 14 women's teams.[222] In 10 of the past 14 years concluding in 2009, U-M has finished in the top five of the NACDA Director's Cup, a ranking compiled by the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics to tabulate the success of universities in competitive sports. U-M has finished in the top 10 of the Directors' Cup standings in 21 of the award's 29 seasons between 1993-2021 and has placed in the top six in nine of the last 10 seasons.[223]\n\n\nMore than 250 Michigan athletes or coaches have participated in Olympic events,[224] and as of 2021 its students and alumni have won 155 Olympic medals.[225]\n\n\nMichigan Stadium is the largest college football stadium in the nation and one of the largest football-only stadiums in the world, with an official capacity of 107,601[226] (the extra seat is said to be \"reserved\" for Fritz Crisler[227]) though attendanceâfrequently over 111,000 spectatorsâregularly exceeds the official capacity.[228] The NCAA's record-breaking attendance has become commonplace at Michigan Stadium.\n\n\nU-M is also home to 29 men's and women's club sports teams, such as rugby, hockey, volleyball, boxing, soccer, and tennis.\n\n\n\n### National championships[edit]\n\n\nThe Michigan football program ranks first in NCAA history in total wins (989 through the end of the 2022 season) and third among FBS schools in winning percentage (.731).[229][230] The team won the first Rose Bowl game in 1902. U-M had 40 consecutive winning seasons from 1968 to 2007, including consecutive bowl game appearances from 1975 to 2007.[231] The Wolverines have won a record 44 Big Ten championships. The program has 11 national championships, most recently in 1997,[232] and has produced three Heisman Trophy winners: Tom Harmon, Desmond Howard and Charles Woodson.[233]\n\n\nThe men's ice hockey team, which plays at Yost Ice Arena, has won nine national championships.[234]\n\n\nThe men's basketball team, which plays at the Crisler Center, has appeared in five Final Fours and won the national championship in 1989. The program also voluntarily vacated victories from its 1992â1993 and 1995â1999 seasons in which illicit payments to players took place, as well as its 1992 and 1993 Final Four appearances.[235] The men's basketball team has most recently won back-to-back Big Ten Tournament Championships.\n\n\n\n### In the Olympics[edit]\n\n\nThrough the 2012 Summer Olympics, 275 U-M students and coaches had participated in the Olympics, winning medals in each Summer Olympic Games except 1896, and winning gold medals in all but four Olympiads. U-M students/student-coaches (e.g., notably, Michael Phelps) have won a total of 185 Olympic medals: 85 golds, 48 silvers, and 52 bronzes.[236]\n\n\n\n### Fight songs and chants[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Michigan's fight song, \"The Victors\", was written by student Louis Elbel in 1898 following the last-minute football victory over the University of Chicago that won a league championship. The song was declared by John Philip Sousa to be \"the greatest college fight song ever written.\"[237] The song refers to the university as being \"the Champions of the West.\" At the time, U-M was part of the Western Conference, which would later become the Big Ten Conference. Michigan was considered to be on the Western Frontier when it was founded in the old Northwest Territory.\n\n\nAlthough mainly used at sporting events, the Michigan fight song is often heard at other events as well. President Gerald Ford had it played by the United States Marine Band as his entrance anthem during his term as president from 1974 to 1977, in preference over the more traditional \"Hail to the Chief\",[238] and the Michigan Marching Band performed a slow-tempo variation of the fight song at his funeral.[239] The fight song is also sung during graduation commencement ceremonies. The university's alma mater song is \"The Yellow and Blue.\" A common rally cry is \"Let's Go Blue!\" which has a complementary short musical arrangement written by former students Joseph Carl, a sousaphonist, and Albert Ahronheim, a drum major.[240]\n\n\nBefore \"The Victors\" was officially the university's fight song, the song \"There'll Be a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight\" was considered to be the school song.[241] After Michigan temporarily withdrew from the Western Conference in 1907, a new Michigan fight song \"Varsity\" was written in 1911 because the line \"champions of the West\" was no longer appropriate.[242]\n\n\n\n## Museums[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of museums and collections at the University of Michigan.\n\n![](image)Newberry Hall (Kelsey Museum of Archeology)\nThe university is also home to several public and research museums including but not limited to the University Museum of Art, University of Michigan Museum of Natural History, Detroit Observatory, Sindecuse Museum of Dentistry, and the LSA Museum of Anthropological Archaeology.\n\n\nKelsey Museum of Archeology has a collection of Roman, Greek, Egyptian, and Middle Eastern artifacts.[243] Between 1972 and 1974, the museum was involved in the excavation of the archaeological site of Dibsi Faraj in northern Syria.[244] The Kelsey Museum re-opened November 1, 2009 after a renovation and expansion.[245]\n\n\nThe collection of the University of Michigan Museum of Art include nearly 19,000 objects that span cultures, eras, and media and include European, American, Middle Eastern, Asian, and African art, as well as changing exhibits. The Museum of Art re-opened in 2009 after a three-year renovation and expansion.[246] UMMA presents special exhibitions and diverse educational programs featuring the visual, performing, film and literary arts that contextualize the gallery experience.[247]\n\n\nThe University of Michigan Museum of Natural History began in the mid-19th century and expanded greatly with the donation of 60,000 specimens by Joseph Beal Steere in the 1870s. The building also houses three research museums: the Museum of Anthropology, Museum of Paleontology. Today, the collections are primarily housed and displayed in the Ruthven Museums Building which was completed in 1928.[248]\n\n\n\n## Notable alumni[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of University of Michigan alumni.\n\nIn addition to U.S. President Gerald Ford, who played on the university's football team, the university is, as of 2020,[update] associated with thirty-four Pulitzer Prize winners, twenty-seven Rhodes Scholars,[249] one Mitchell Scholar,[250] and ten Nobel laureates. As of 2012[update], the university had almost 500,000 living alumni.[251]\n\n\nMore than 250 Michigan graduates have served as legislators as either a United States Senator (47 graduates) or as a Congressional representative (over 215 graduates), including former House Majority Leader Dick Gephardt[252] and U.S. Representative Justin Amash, who represented Michigan's Third Congressional District.[253] Mike Duggan, Mayor of Detroit, earned his bachelor's degree and J.D. degree at Michigan, while the former Michigan Governor Rick Snyder earned his bachelor, M.B.A., and J.D. degrees from Michigan. Former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson received his medical degree from the U-M medical school. Thomas E. Dewey, another Michigan alumnus, was the Governor of New York from 1943 to 1954 and was the Republican Party's presidential nominee in the 1944 and 1948 presidential elections. The 13th President of Pakistan, Arif Alvi, completed his master's degree in prosthodontics in 1975.\n\n\n\n* ![Clarence Darrow Lawyer (1878, Law)](image)\n\nClarence Darrow  \nLawyer  \n(1878, Law)\n* ![Frank Murphy Supreme Court Justice (1914, Law)](image)\n\nFrank Murphy  \nSupreme Court Justice  \n(1914, Law)\n* ![Arleigh Burke Admiral, namesake of destroyer class (1931, MS)](image)\n\nArleigh Burke  \nAdmiral, namesake of destroyer class  \n(1931, MS)\n* ![Gerald Ford President (1935, BA)](image)\n\nGerald Ford  \nPresident  \n(1935, BA)\n* ![Raoul Wallenberg Diplomat and humanitarian (1935, BA)](image)\n\nRaoul Wallenberg  \nDiplomat and humanitarian  \n(1935, BA)\n* ![Arthur Miller Playwright (1938, BA)](image)\n\nArthur Miller  \nPlaywright  \n(1938, BA)\n* ![Mike Wallace Journalist (1939, BA)](image)\n\nMike Wallace  \nJournalist  \n(1939, BA)\n* ![James Earl Jones Actor (1955, BA)](image)\n\nJames Earl Jones  \nActor  \n(1955, BA)\n* ![James Irwin Astronaut, co-founder of UM Club of the Moon (1957, MS)](image)\n\nJames Irwin  \nAstronaut, co-founder of UM Club of the Moon (1957, MS)\n* ![Jessye Norman Opera singer (1968, MA)](image)\n\nJessye Norman  \nOpera singer  \n(1968, MA)\n* ![Lawrence Kasdan Filmmaker (1971, M.Ed.)](image)\n\nLawrence Kasdan  \nFilmmaker  \n(1971, M.Ed.)\n* ![Eugene Robinson Columnist (1974, BA)](image)\n\nEugene Robinson  \nColumnist  \n(1974, BA)\n* ![Edmund White Author (1962, BA)](image)\n\nEdmund White  \nAuthor  \n(1962, BA)\n* Madonna Entertainer (No degree)\n\nMadonna  \nEntertainer  \n(No degree)\n* ![Larry Page Co-founder of Google (1995, BS)](image)\n\nLarry Page  \nCo-founder of Google  \n(1995, BS)\n* ![Tom Brady Football player (1999, BGS)](image)\n\nTom Brady  \nFootball player  \n(1999, BGS)\n* ![Michael Phelps Olympic swimmer (No degree)](image)\n\nMichael Phelps  \nOlympic swimmer  \n(No degree)\n\n\nU-M's contributions to aeronautics include aircraft designer Clarence \"Kelly\" Johnson of Lockheed Skunk Works fame,[254] Lockheed president Willis Hawkins, and several astronauts including the all-U-M crews of both Gemini 4[255] and Apollo 15.[256]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nRobert E. Park\n![](image)\nAlice Hamilton (MD, 1893)\n![](image)\nClaude Shannon (BA, BSEE)\n\nNumerous U-M graduates contributed to the field of computer science, including Claude Shannon (who made major contributions to the mathematics of information theory),[257] and Turing Award winners Edgar Codd, Stephen Cook, Frances E. Allen and Michael Stonebraker. U-M also counts among its alumni nearly two dozen billionaires, including prominent tech-company founders and co-founders such as J. Robert Beyster, who founded Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) in 1969[258] and Google co-founder Larry Page.[259]\n\n\n\n![](image)Alice Freeman Palmer (BA, 1876, PhD Hon, 1882)\nBy 1900, nearly 150 women had received advanced degrees from U-M.[260] Sarah Dix Hamlin was the first female student accepted to the University of Michigan. She graduated in 1874.[261] Marjorie Lee Browne received her M.S. in 1939 and her doctoral degree in 1950, becoming the third African American woman to earn a PhD in mathematics.[262][263] Many, however, were forced to leave the university to continue their studies or to become faculty in their own right elsewhere, like Katharine Comanâwhen U-M President James Angell offered her a \"Dean of Women\" position, she told him that \"'if the regents...wish to propose a chaperone for students, and propose to dignify that office by allowing the woman who holds it to do a little University teaching,' she was not interested. If, however, the regents accepted women as equal partners and as faculty, and if she were one of several women given proper rank and authority, she would consider it.\"[260] Michigan's Regents did not accept, so instead Coman became dean, founder of the Economics Department, and the first female statistics professor in the US at Wellesley College.[264]:â15\n\n\nNotable writers who attended U-M include playwright Arthur Miller,[252] essayists Susan Orlean,[252] Jia Tolentino,[265] Sven Birkerts, journalists and editors Mike Wallace,[252] Jonathan Chait of *The New Republic*, Indian author and columnist Anees Jung, Daniel Okrent,[252] and Sandra Steingraber, food critics Ruth Reichl and Gael Greene, novelists Brett Ellen Block, Elizabeth Kostova, Marge Piercy,[252] Brad Meltzer,[252] Betty Smith,[252] and Charles Major, screenwriter Judith Guest,[252] Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Theodore Roethke, National Book Award winners Keith Waldrop and Jesmyn Ward, composer/author/puppeteer Forman Brown, Alireza Jafarzadeh (a Middle East analyst, author, and TV commentator), and memoirist and self-help book author Jerry Newport.\n\n\nIn Hollywood, famous alumni include actors Michael Dunn,[252] Darren Criss, James Earl Jones,[252] David Alan Grier,[252] actresses Lucy Liu,[252] Gilda Radner,[252] and Selma Blair,[252] television director Mark Cendrowski, and filmmaker Lawrence Kasdan.[252] Many Broadway and musical theatre actors, including Gavin Creel,[252] Andrew Keenan-Bolger, his sister Celia Keenan-Bolger, and Taylor Louderman attended U-M for musical theatre. The musical theatre group StarKid Productions had their start at the university, and staged multiple productions there.[266]\n\n\nMusical graduates include operatic soprano Jessye Norman,[252] singer Joe Dassin, multiple members of the band Tally Hall, jazz guitarist Randy Napoleon, and Mannheim Steamroller founder Chip Davis.[252] Well-known composers who are alumni include Frank Ticheli, Andrew Lippa, and the Oscar and Tony Award-winning duo Benj Pasek and Justin Paul. Pop superstar Madonna[252] and rock legend Iggy Pop,[252] attended but did not graduate.\n\n\n\n![](image)14th President of Yale University James Rowland Angell, an early proponent of eugenics, graduated from Michigan in 1890. His father, James Burrill Angell, was President of the University of Michigan from 1871 to 1909.\nOther U-M graduates include former Dean of Harvard Law School Martha Minow, Dean of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania Erika H. James, current Dean of Yale Law School, Heather Gerken, assisted-suicide advocate Jack Kevorkian,[252] Weather Underground radical activist Bill Ayers,[267] activist Tom Hayden,[252] architect Charles Moore,[268] the Swedish Holocaust hero Raoul Wallenberg,[269] and Civil War General Benjamin D. Pritchard.[270] Neurosurgeon and CNN chief medical correspondent Sanjay Gupta attended both college and medical school at the university.[271] Clarence Darrow attended law school at U-M at a time when many lawyers did not receive any formal education.[252] Frank Murphy, who was mayor of Detroit, governor of Michigan, attorney general of the United States, and Supreme Court justice was also a graduate of the Law School.[252] Conservative pundit Ann Coulter is another U-M law school graduate (J.D. 1988).[252]\n\n\nVaughn R. Walker, a federal district judge in California who overturned the controversial California Proposition 8 in 2010 and ruled it unconstitutional, received his undergraduate degree from U-M in 1966.[272]\n\n\nKenneth Marin, who became a professor of economics after he graduated from the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, was appointed by President Lyndon B. Johnson as a member of the White House Consumer Advisory Council where he served on Wage and Price Control in the mid-1960s. He went to Tanzania in the late sixties and worked as an economic advisor to the government of President Julius Nyerere until the early 1970s.\n\n\nU-M athletes have starred in Major League Baseball, the National Football League and National Basketball Association as well as other professional sports. Notable among recent players is Tom Brady of the New England Patriots and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.[252] Three players have won college football's Heisman Trophy, awarded to the player considered the best in the nation: Tom Harmon (1940), Desmond Howard (1991) and Charles Woodson (1997).[233] Professional golfer John Schroeder and Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps also attended the University of Michigan, with the latter studying Sports Marketing and Management. Phelps also swam competitively for Club Wolverine, a swimming club associated with the university.[273] National Hockey League players Marty Turco, Luke Hughes, Chris Summers, Max Pacioretty, Carl Hagelin, Dylan Larkin, Zach Hyman, Brendan Morrison,[252] Jack Johnson, and Michael Cammalleri[252] all played for U-M's ice hockey team. Baseball Hall of Famers George Sisler and Barry Larkin also played baseball at the university.[252] Several team owners have also been alumni, including multiple-team owner Bill Davidson (NBA Detroit Pistons, NHL Tampa Bay Lightning, WNBA Detroit Shock, among others) and NFL owners Stephen M. Ross (Miami Dolphins), Preston Robert Tisch (New York Giants), and Ralph Wilson (Buffalo Bills).\n\n\nThe university claims the only alumni association with a chapter on the Moon, established in 1971 when the crew of Apollo 15 (two of whom had engineering degrees from U-M; the third had attended for a year before transferring[256]) placed a charter plaque for a new U-M Alumni Association on the lunar surface.[252] The plaque states: \"The Alumni Association of The University of Michigan. Charter Number 1. This is to certify that The University of Michigan Club of The Moon is a duly constituted unit of the Alumni Association and entitled to all the rights and privileges under the Association's Constitution.\" Several small U-M flags were also brought on the mission; a persistent campus legend claims at least one flag was left on the Moon.[256]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Other consists of Multiracial Americans & those who prefer to not say.\n2. **^** The percentage of students who received an income-based federal Pell grant intended for low-income students.\n3. **^** The percentage of students who are a part of the American middle class at the bare minimum.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"U-M's Foundings in Detroit and Ann Arbor: Key Dates\".

Headquartered in Oakland, the system is composed of its ten campuses at Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, Merced, Riverside, San Diego, San Francisco, Santa Barbara, and Santa Cruz, along with numerous research centers and academic abroad centers.[5] The system is the state's land-grant university.[6] Major publications generally rank most UC campuses as being among the best universities in the world. In 1900, UC was one of the founders of the Association of American Universities and since the 1970s seven of its campuses, in addition to Berkeley, have been admitted to the association. Berkeley, Davis, Santa Cruz, Irvine, Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, and San Diego are considered Public Ivies, making California the state with the most universities in the nation to hold the title.[7][8] UC campuses have large numbers of distinguished faculty in almost every academic discipline, with UC faculty and researchers having won 71 Nobel Prizes as of 2021.[9]\n\n\nThe system's ten campuses have a combined student body of 294,309 students, 24,800 faculty members, 167,300 staff members and over two million living alumni.[2] Its newest campus in Merced opened in fall 2005. Nine campuses enroll both undergraduate and graduate students; one campus, UC San Francisco, enrolls only graduate and professional students in the medical and health sciences. In addition, the University of California College of the Law located in San Francisco, is legally affiliated with UC and shares its name but is otherwise autonomous. Under the California Master Plan for Higher Education, the University of California is a part of the state's three-system public higher education plan, which also includes the California State University system and the California Community Colleges system. UC is governed by a Board of Regents whose autonomy from the rest of the state government is protected by the state constitution.[10] The University of California also manages or co-manages three national laboratories for the U.S. Department of Energy: Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), and Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL).[11]\n\n\nThe University of California was founded on March 23, 1868, and operated in Oakland, where it absorbed the assets of the College of California before moving to Berkeley in 1873.[12][13] It also affiliated with independent medical and law schools in San Francisco. Over the next eight decades, several branch locations and satellite programs were established across the state. In March 1951, the University of California began to reorganize itself into something distinct from its campus in Berkeley, with UC President Robert Gordon Sproul staying in place as chief executive of the UC system, while Clark Kerr became Berkeley's first chancellor[14][15][16][17] and Raymond B. Allen became the first chancellor of UCLA.[18] However, the 1951 reorganization was stalled by resistance from Sproul and his allies,[19] and it was not until Kerr succeeded Sproul as UC president that UC was able to evolve into a university system from 1957 to 1960.[20] At that time, chancellors were appointed for additional campuses and each was granted some degree of greater autonomy.[21]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)In November 1857, the College of California's trustees began to acquire various parcels of land facing the Golden Gate in what is now Berkeley.\nIn 1849, the state of California ratified its first constitution, which contained the express objective of creating a complete educational system including a state university.[22] Taking advantage of the Morrill Land-Grant Acts, the California State Legislature established an Agricultural, Mining, and Mechanical Arts College in 1866.[23][24] However, it existed only on paper, as a placeholder to secure federal land-grant funds.[24]\n\n\nMeanwhile, Congregational minister Henry Durant, an alumnus of Yale, had established the private Contra Costa Academy, on June 20, 1853, in Oakland, California.[23] The initial site was bounded by Twelfth and Fourteenth Streets and Harrison and Franklin Streets in downtown Oakland[23] (and is marked today by State Historical Plaque No. 45 at the northeast corner of Thirteenth and Franklin). In turn, the academy's trustees were granted a charter in 1855 for a College of California, though the college continued to operate as a college preparatory school until it added college-level courses in 1860.[23][24] The college's trustees, educators, and supporters believed in the importance of a liberal arts education (especially the study of the Greek and Roman classics), but ran into a lack of interest in liberal arts colleges on the American frontier (as a true college, the college was graduating only three or four students per year).[24]\n\n\n\n![](image)South Hall, built in 1873, is the oldest building on the Berkeley campus.\nIn November 1857, the college's trustees began to acquire various parcels of land facing the Golden Gate in what is now Berkeley for a future planned campus to the north of Oakland.[23] But first, they needed to secure the college's water rights by buying a large farm to the east.[23] In 1864, they organized the College Homestead Association, which borrowed $35,000 to purchase the land, plus another $33,000 to purchase 160 acres (650,000 m2) of land to the south of the future campus.[25] The association subdivided the latter parcel and started selling lots with the hope it could raise enough money to repay its lenders and also create a new college town.[23] But sales of new homesteads fell short.[23]\n\n\nGovernor Frederick Low favored the establishment of a state university based upon the University of Michigan plan, and thus in one sense may be regarded as the founder of the University of California.[23][24] At the College of California's 1867 commencement exercises, where Low was present, Yale University professor Benjamin Silliman Jr. criticized the 1866 California law for establishing a polytechnic school, instead of a real university.[23][24] That same day, Low reportedly first suggested a merger of the already-functional College of California (which had land, buildings, faculty, and students, but not enough money) with the nonfunctional state college (which had money and nothing else), and went on to participate in the ensuing negotiations.[23][24]\n\n\n\n![](image)UC San Francisco campus in 1908.\nOn October 9, 1867, the college's trustees reluctantly agreed to join forces with the state college to their mutual advantage, but under one conditionâthat there not be simply an \"Agricultural, Mining, and Mechanical Arts College\", but a complete university, within which the assets of the College of California would be used to create a College of Letters (now known as the College of Letters and Science).[23][24][26] Accordingly, the Organic Act, establishing the University of California, was introduced as a bill by Assemblyman John W. Dwinelle on March 5, 1868, and after it was duly passed by both houses of the state legislature, it was signed into state law by Governor Henry H. Haight (Low's successor) on March 23, 1868.[23][24][27] However, as legally constituted, the new university was *not* an actual merger of the two colleges, but was an entirely new institution which merely inherited certain objectives and assets from each of them.[28] The University of California's second president, Daniel Coit Gilman, opened its new campus in Berkeley in September 1873.[29]\n\n\n\n### UC affiliates[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Citrus Experiment Station, built in 1917, is the oldest building on the UC Riverside campus.\nSection 8 of the Organic Act authorized the Board of Regents to affiliate the University of California with independent self-sustaining professional colleges.[30][31] \"Affiliation\" meant UC and its affiliates would \"share the risk in launching new endeavors in education\".[30] The affiliates shared the prestige of the state university's brand, and UC agreed to award degrees in its own name to their graduates on the recommendation of their respective faculties, but the affiliates were otherwise managed independently by their own boards of trustees, charged their own tuition and fees, and maintained their own budgets separate from the UC budget.[30] It was through the process of affiliation that UC was able to claim it had medical and law schools in San Francisco within a decade of its founding.[30]\n\n\nIn 1879, California adopted its second and current constitution, which included unusually strong language to ensure UC's independence from the rest of the state government.[10][32] This had lasting consequences for the Hastings College of the Law, which had been separately chartered and affiliated in 1878 by an act of the state legislature at the behest of founder Serranus Clinton Hastings.[33] After a falling out with his own handpicked board of directors, the founder persuaded the state legislature in 1883 and 1885 to pass new laws to place his law school under the direct control of the Board of Regents.[34] In 1886, the Supreme Court of California declared those newer acts to be unconstitutional because the clause protecting UC's independence in the 1879 state constitution had stripped the state legislature of the ability to amend the 1878 act.[35][36] To this day, the Hastings College of the Law remains an affiliate of UC, maintains its own board of directors, and is not governed by the regents.[30][35]\n\n\n\n![](image)Hart Hall, built in 1928, is the oldest building on the UC Davis campus.\nIn contrast, Toland Medical College (founded in 1864 and affiliated in 1873) and later, the dental, pharmacy, and nursing schools in San Francisco were affiliated with UC through written agreements, and not statutes invested with constitutional importance by court decisions.[30] In the early 20th century, the Affiliated Colleges (as they came to be called) began to agree to submit to the regents' governance during the term of President Benjamin Ide Wheeler, as the Board of Regents had come to recognize the problems inherent in the existence of independent entities that shared the UC brand but over which UC had no real control.[30] While Hastings remained independent, the Affiliated Colleges were able to increasingly coordinate their operations with one another under the supervision of the UC president and regents, and evolved into the health sciences campus known today as the University of California, San Francisco.[30]\n\n\n\n### North-south tensions and decentralization[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Powell Library, built in 1929, is one of the four oldest buildings on the UCLA campus.\nIn August 1882, the California State Normal School (whose original normal school in San Jose is now San Jose State University) opened a second school in Los Angeles to train teachers for the growing population of Southern California.[37] In 1887, the Los Angeles school was granted its own board of trustees independent of the San Jose school, and in 1919, the state legislature transferred it to UC control and renamed it the Southern Branch of the University of California.[38] In 1927, it became the University of California at Los Angeles; the \"at\" would be replaced with a comma in 1958.[39]\n\n\nLos Angeles surpassed San Francisco in the 1920 census to become the most populous metropolis in California. Because Los Angeles had become the state government's single largest source of both tax revenue and votes, its residents felt entitled to demand more prestige and autonomy for their campus. Their efforts bore fruit in March 1951, when UCLA became the first UC site outside of Berkeley to achieve *de jure* coequal status with the Berkeley campus. That month, the regents approved a reorganization plan under which both the Berkeley and Los Angeles campuses would be supervised by chancellors reporting to the UC president.[14][15][16][40] However, the 1951 plan was severely flawed; it was overly vague about how the chancellors were to become the \"executive heads\" of their campuses. Due to stubborn resistance from President Sproul and several vice presidents and deansâwho simply carried on as beforeâthe chancellors ended up as glorified provosts with limited control over academic affairs and long-range planning while the president and the regents retained *de facto* control over everything else.[19]\n\n\n\n![](image)UC Irvine was founded and had its campus built out in the 1960s.\nUpon becoming president in October 1957, Clark Kerr supervised UC's rapid transformation into a true public university system through a series of proposals adopted unanimously by the regents from 1957 to 1960.[20][21] Kerr's reforms included expressly granting all campus chancellors the full range of executive powers, privileges, and responsibilities which Sproul had denied to Kerr himself, as well as the radical decentralization of a tightly knit bureaucracy in which all lines of authority had always run directly to the president at Berkeley or to the regents themselves.[20][21][40] In 1965, UCLA Chancellor Franklin D. Murphy tried to push this to what he saw as its logical conclusion: he advocated for authorizing all chancellors to report directly to the Board of Regents, thereby rendering the UC president redundant.[41] Murphy wanted to transform UC from one federated university into a confederation of independent universities, similar to the situation in Kansas (from where he was recruited).[41] Murphy was unable to develop any support for his proposal, Kerr quickly put down what he thought of as \"Murphy's rebellion\", and therefore Kerr's vision of UC as a university system prevailed: \"one university with pluralistic decision-making\".[41]\n\n\n\n![](image)Geisel Library, at UC San Diego, was built in 1970.\nDuring the 20th century, UC acquired additional satellite locations which, like Los Angeles, were all subordinate to administrators at the Berkeley campus. California farmers lobbied for UC to perform applied research responsive to their immediate needs; in 1905, the Legislature established a \"University Farm School\" at Davis and in 1907 a \"Citrus Experiment Station\" at Riverside as adjuncts to the College of Agriculture at Berkeley. In 1912, UC acquired a private oceanography laboratory in San Diego, which had been founded nine years earlier by local business promoters working with a Berkeley professor. In 1944, UC acquired Santa Barbara State College from the California State Colleges, the descendants of the State Normal Schools.[42] In 1958, the regents began promoting these locations to general campuses, thereby creating UCSB (1958), UC Davis (1959), UC Riverside (1959), UC San Diego (1960), and UCSF (1964).[43][44] Each campus was also granted the right to have its own chancellor upon promotion. In response to California's continued population growth, UC opened two additional general campuses in 1965, with UC Irvine opening in Irvine and UC Santa Cruz opening in Santa Cruz.[43] The youngest campus, UC Merced opened in fall 2005 to serve the San Joaquin Valley.\n\n\n\n![](image)UC Santa Cruz, founded in 1965.\nAfter losing campuses in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara to the University of California system, supporters of the California State College system arranged for the state constitution to be amended in 1946 to prevent similar losses from happening again in the future.[42]\n\n\nWith decentralization complete, it was decided in 1986 that the UC president should no longer be based at the Berkeley campus, and the UC Office of the President moved to Kaiser Center in Oakland in 1989.[45] That lakefront location was subject to widespread criticism as \"too elegant and too corporate for a public university\".[46] In 1998, the Office of the President moved again, to a newly constructed but much more modest building near the former site of the College of California in Oakland.[47]\n\n\n\n### Modern history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)UC Merced, founded in 2005.\nThe California Master Plan for Higher Education of 1960 established that UC must admit undergraduates from the top 12.5% (one-eighth) of graduating high school seniors in California. Prior to the promulgation of the Master Plan, UC was to admit undergraduates from the top 15%. UC does not currently adhere to all tenets of the original Master Plan, such as the directives that no campus was to exceed total enrollment of 27,500 students (in order to ensure quality) and that public higher education should be tuition-free for California residents. Five campuses, Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, and San Diego, each have current total enrollment at over 30,000, and of these five, all but Irvine have undergraduate enrollments over 30,000.[3]\n\n\nAfter the state electorate severely limited long-term property tax revenue by enacting Proposition 13 in 1978, UC was forced to make up for the resulting collapse in state financial support by imposing a variety of fees which were tuition in all but name.[48][49][50] On November 18, 2010, the regents finally gave up on the longstanding legal fiction that UC does not charge tuition by renaming the Educational Fee to \"Tuition\".[51] As part of its search for funds during the 2000s and 2010s, UC quietly began to admit higher percentages of highly accomplished (and more lucrative) students from other states and countries,[52] but was forced to reverse course in 2015 in response to the inevitable public outcry and start admitting more California residents.[53][54]\n\n\nOn November 14, 2022, about 48,000 academic workers at all regent-governed UC campuses, as well as the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, went on strike for higher pay and benefits as authorized by the United Auto Workers (UAW) union.[55] UAW has cited more than 20 unfair labor practice charges performed by UC, including unilateral changes in policy and obstructing worker negotiation.[56] The strike lasted almost six weeks, officially ending on December 23.[57]\n\n\n\n## Governance[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Office of the President of the University of California, in Oakland\nAll University of California campuses except Hastings College of the Law are governed by the Regents of the University of California as required by the Constitution of the State of California.[32] Eighteen regents are appointed by the governor for 12-year terms.[32] One member is a student appointed for a one-year term.[32] There are also seven *ex officio* membersâthe governor, lieutenant governor, speaker of the State Assembly, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, president and vice president of the alumni associations of UC, and the UC president.[32] The Academic Senate, made up of faculty members, is empowered by the regents to set academic policies.[32] In addition, the system-wide faculty chair and vice-chair sit on the Board of Regents as non-voting members.[32]\n\n\n\n### President of the University of California[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Blake House and Gardens, built by architect Walter Danforth Bliss in 1924, served as the official residence of the UC President, from 1967 until 2008, when it was opened to the public.\nOriginally, the president was the chief executive of the first campus, Berkeley. In turn, other UC locations (with the exception of Hastings College of the Law) were treated as off-site departments of the Berkeley campus, and were headed by provosts who were subordinate to the president. In March 1951, the regents reorganized the university's governing structure. Starting with the 1952â53 academic year, day-to-day \"chief executive officer\" functions for the Berkeley and Los Angeles campuses were transferred to chancellors who were vested with a high degree of autonomy, and reported as equals to UC's president.[14][15][16] As noted above, the regents promoted five additional UC locations to campuses and allowed them to have chancellors of their own in a series of decisions from 1958 to 1964,[43] and the three campuses added since then have also been run by chancellors. In turn, all chancellors (again, with the exception of Hastings) report as equals to the University of California President. Today, the UC Office of the President (UCOP) and the Office of the Secretary and Chief of Staff to the Regents of the University of California share an office building in downtown Oakland that serves as the UC system's headquarters.[58]\n\n\nKerr's vision for UC governance was \"one university with pluralistic decision-making\".[59] In other words, the internal delegation of operational authority to chancellors at the campus level and allowing nine other campuses to become separate centers of academic life independent of Berkeley did not change the fact that all campuses remain part of one legal entity. As a 1968 UC centennial coffee table book explained: \"Yet for all its campuses, colleges, schools, institutes, and research stations, it remains one University, under one Board of Regents and one presidentâthe University of California.\"[60] UC continues to take a \"united approach\" as one university in matters in which it inures to UC's advantage to do so, such as when negotiating with the legislature and governor in Sacramento.[59] The University of California continues to manage certain matters at the systemwide level in order to maintain common standards across all campuses, such as student admissions, appointment and promotion of faculty, and approval of academic programs.[61]\n\n\n\nList of presidents\n![](image)Michael V.

Drake, a former UC chancellor and medical research professor, was selected as the 21st president of the University of California system, making him the first black president to hold the office in UC's 152-year history. He took office on August 1, 2020.[63]\n\n\n\nOfficial residences\n![](image)University House, Berkeley served as the official residence of the UC President from 1911 until 1958. Today it serves Berkeley's Chancellor.\nBesides substantial six-figure incomes, the UC president and all UC chancellors enjoy controversial perks such as free housing in the form of university-maintained mansions.[64] In 1962, Anson Blake's will donated his 10-acre (40,000Â m2) estate (Blake Garden) and mansion (Blake House) in Kensington to the University of California's Department of Landscape Architecture. In 1968, the regents decided to make Blake House the official residence of the UC president. As of 2005, it cost around $300,000 per year to maintain Blake Garden and Blake House; the latter, built in 1926, is a 13,239-square-foot (1,229.9Â m2) mansion with a view of San Francisco Bay.[64]\n\n\nBlake House has sat vacant since President Dynes departed in 2008, due to the high cost of needed seismic strengthening and renovating its dilapidated interior (estimated at $3.5 million in 2013).[65] From 2008 to 2022, all three UC presidents during that timeframe (i.e., Yudof, Napolitano, and Drake) lived in rented homes.[65] In 2022, UC finally purchased the Selden Williams House, a 6,400-square-foot (590Â m2) house in Berkeley, for $6.5 million to serve as the UC president's official residence.[65] UC had previously owned the same home from 1971 to 1991, when it served as the official residence of the UC vice president.[65] (UC no longer has a single \"vice president\"; the president's direct reports now have titles like \"executive vice president\", \"senior vice president\", or \"vice president\".[66]) \n\n\n\n![](image)Selden Williams House, built in 1928 and designed by architect Julia Morgan, serves as the official residence of the UC President, since 2022.\nAll UC chancellors traditionally live for free in a mansion on or near campus that is usually known as *University House*, where they host social functions attended by guests and donors.[67] Berkeley's University House formerly served as the official residence of the UC president, but is now the official residence of Berkeley's chancellor. UCSD's University House was closed from 2004 to 2014 for $10.5 million in renovations paid for by private donors, which were so expensive because the 12,000-square-foot structure sits on top of a sacred Native American cemetery and next to an unstable coastal bluff.[68][69]\n\n\n\n### Finances[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University of California finances\n\nThe State of California currently (2021â2022) spends $3.467 billion on the UC system, out of total UC operating revenues of $41.6 billion. The \"UC Budget for Current Operations\" lists the medical centers as the largest revenue source, contributing 39% of the budget, the federal government 11%, Core Funds (State General Funds, UC General Funds, student tuition) 21%, private support (gifts, grants, endowments) 7% ,and Sales and Services at 21%. In 1980, the state funded 86.8% of the UC budget.[70] While state funding has somewhat recovered, as of 2019 state support still lags behind even recent historic levels (e.g. 2001) when adjusted for inflation.[70][71]\n\n\nAccording to the California Public Policy Institute, California spends 12% of its General Fund on higher education, but that percentage is divided between the University of California, California State University and California Community Colleges. Over the past forty years, state funding of higher education has dropped from 18% to 12%, resulting in a drop in UC's per student funding from $23,000 in 2016 to a current $8,000 per year per student.[72]\n\n\n\n![](image)View of the UC Office of the President.\nIn May 2004, UC President Robert C. Dynes and CSU Chancellor Charles B. Reed struck a private deal, called the \"Higher Education Compact\", with Governor Schwarzenegger. They agreed to slash spending by about a billion dollars (about a third of the university's core budget for academic operations) in exchange for a funding formula lasting until 2011. The agreement calls for modest annual increases in state funds (but not enough to replace the loss in state funds Dynes and Schwarzenegger agreed to), private fundraising to help pay for basic programs, and large student fee hikes, especially for graduate and professional students. A detailed analysis of the Compact by the Academic Senate \"Futures Report\" indicated, despite the large fee increases, the university core budget did not recover to 2000 levels.[73] Undergraduate student fees have risen 90% from 2003 to 2007.[74] In 2011, for the first time in UC's history, student fees exceeded contributions from the State of California.[75]\n\n\nThe First District Court of Appeal in San Francisco ruled in 2007 that the University of California owed nearly $40 million in refunds to about 40,000 students who were promised that their tuition fees would remain steady, but were hit with increases when the state ran short of money in 2003.[76]\n\n\nIn September 2019, the University of California announced it will divest its $83 billion in endowment and pension funds from the fossil fuel industry, ostensibly to avoid the \"financial risk\" inherent in that industry because of climate change, but also responsive pleas to stop investing in fossil fuel.[77]\n\n\n\n### Criticism[edit]\n\n\nIn 2008, the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, the regional accreditor of the UC schools, criticized the UC system for \"significant problems in governance, leadership and decision making\" and \"confusion about the roles and responsibilities of the university president, the regents and the 10 campus chancellors with no clear lines of authority and boundaries\".[78]\n\n\nIn 2016, university system officials admitted that they monitored all e-mails sent to and from their servers.[79]\n\n\n\n## Campuses and rankings[edit]\n\n\n![A topographic map of California with the UC campuses marked](image)![Berkeley](image)\nBerkeley\n ![San Diego](image)\nSan Diego\n ![Los Angeles](image)\nLos Angeles\n ![Santa Barbara](image)\nSanta Barbara\n ![San Francisco](image)\nSan Francisco\n ![Irvine](image)\nIrvine\n ![Davis](image)\nDavis\n ![Santa Cruz](image)\nSanta Cruz\n ![Riverside](image)\nRiverside\n ![Merced](image)\nMerced\nclass=notpageimage|\nThe ten UC campuses\n\nAt present, the UC system officially describes itself as a \"ten campus\" system consisting of the campuses listed below.[80] These campuses are under the direct control of the regents and president.[81] Only ten campuses are listed on the official UC letterhead.[82]\n\n\nAlthough it shares the name and public status of the UC system, the College of the Law, San Francisco (formerly Hastings College of the Law) is not controlled by the regents or president; it has a separate board of directors and must seek funding directly from the Legislature. However, under the California Education Code, Hastings degrees are awarded in the name of the regents and bear the signature of the UC president.[83] Furthermore, Education Code section 92201 states that Hastings \"is affiliated with the University of California, and is the law department thereof\".[84]\n\n\n\n### University rankings[edit]\n\n\nAnnually, UC campuses are ranked highly by various publications. Six UC campuses rank in the top 50 U.S. National Universities of 2022 by *U.S. News & World Report*, with UCLA, Berkeley, UC Santa Barbara, UC San Diego, UC Irvine, and UC Davis all ranked in the top 50. Four UC campuses also ranked in the top 50 in the *U.S. News & World Report* Best Global Universities Rankings in 2021, namely Berkeley, UCLA, UCSF, and UC San Diego.[85] UCSF is ranked as one of the top universities in biomedicine in the world[86][87][88][89][90][91] and the UCSF School of Medicine is ranked 3rd in the United States among research-oriented medical schools and for primary care by *U.S. News & World Report*.[92]\n\n\nThree UC campuses: Berkeley, UCLA, and UC San Diego all ranked in the top 15 universities in the US according to the 2020 *Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU)* US National University Rankings and also in the top 20 in World University Rankings. The *Academic Ranking of World Universities* also ranked UCSF, UC Davis, UC Irvine, and UC Santa Barbara in the top 50 US National Universities and in the top 100 World Universities in 2020.[93]\n\n\nBerkeley, UCLA, and UC San Diego all ranked in the top 50 universities in the world according to both the *Times Higher Education World University Rankings* for 2021 and the *Center for World University Rankings (CWUR)* for 2020, while UC Irvine, UC Santa Barbara, and UC Davis ranked in the top 100 universities in the world.[94][95] *Forbes* also ranked the six UC campuses mentioned above as being in the top 50 universities in America in 2021.[96] Forbes also named the top three public universities in America as all being UC campuses, namely, Berkeley, UCLA, and UCSD, and ranked three more campuses, UC Davis, UC Santa Barbara, and UC Irvine as being among the top 20 public universities in America in 2021.[97] The six aforementioned campuses are all considered Public Ivies.[7] The *QS World University Rankings* for 2021 ranked three UC campuses: Berkeley, UCLA and UC San Diego as being in the top 100 universities in the world.[98]\n\n\nIndividual academic departments also rank highly among the UC campuses. The 2021 *U.S. News & World Report* Best Graduate Schools report ranked Berkeley as being among the top 5 universities in the nation in the departments of Psychology, Economics, Political Science, Computer Science, Engineering, Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Mathematics, Earth Sciences, Physics, Sociology, History, and English, and ranked UCLA in the top 20 in the same departments.[99][100] *U.S. News & World Report* also ranked the same departments at UC San Diego among the top 20 in the nation, with the exception of the departments of Sociology, History, and English.[101] UC Davis, UC Irvine and UC Santa Barbara ranked in the top 50 in the departments of Psychology, Economics, Political Science, Computer Science, Engineering, Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Mathematics, Earth Sciences, Physics, Sociology, History, and English, with the exception of UC Santa Barbara's Psychology and Political Science departments, according to *U.S. News & World Report*. UC Santa Cruz and UC Riverside ranked in the top 100 in the nation in the same departments, along with UC Merced's Psychology and Political Science departments.[102][103][104]\n\n\n\n| Campus\n | Founded\n | Enrollment\n(2022)[105]\n | Endowment\n(2022)[106]\n | Athletics\n | Rankings\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Affiliation\n | Nickname\n | *ARWU National Ranking*[93] | *ARWU World Ranking*[93] | *CWUR*[94] | *Forbes*[96] | *THE World University Rankings*[95] | *QS World University Rankings*[98] | *U.S. News & World Report National Ranking*[107] | *U.S. News & World Report World Ranking*[85] |\n| ![](image)  **Berkeley** | 1868\n | 45,307\n | $6.91 billion\n | NCAA Div IPac-12 | Golden Bears | 4\n | 5\n | 12\n | 2\n | 8\n | 10\n | 15\n | 4\n |\n| ![](image) **Davis** | 1905\n | 39,679\n | $2.06 billion\n | NCAA Div IBig West | Aggies | 40â54\n | 101â150\n | 52\n | 23\n | 63\n | 132\n | 28\n | 67\n |\n| ![](image) **Irvine** | 1965\n | 35,937\n | $1.25 billion\n | NCAA Div IBig West | Anteaters | 33\n | 61\n | 82\n | 30\n | 95\n | 268\n | 33\n | 86\n |\n| ![](image) **Los Angeles** | 1919\n | 46,430\n | $6.72 billion\n | NCAA Div IPac-12 (Big Ten in 2024) | Bruins | 11\n | 13\n | 18\n | 6\n | 21\n | 29\n | 15\n | 14\n |\n| ![](image) **Merced** | 2005\n | 9,103\n | $85 million\n | NAIACalPac | Golden Bobcats | 107â127\n | 401â500\n | 841\n | 309\n | 301â350\n | â\n | 60\n | 718\n |\n| ![](image) **Riverside** | 1954\n | 26,809\n | $354 million\n | NCAA Div IBig West | Highlanders | 63â85\n | 201â300\n | 252\n | 84\n | 251â300\n | 404\n | 76\n | 169\n |\n| ![](image) **San Diego** | 1960\n | 42,006\n | $2.39 billion\n | NCAA Div IBig West | Tritons | 16\n | 21\n | 33\n | 17\n | 32\n | 62\n | 28\n | 21\n |\n| ![](image) **San Francisco** | 1864\n | 3,140(Graduate only) | $5.46 billion\n | â\n | â\n | 15\n | 19\n | 36\n | â\n | â\n | â\n | â\n | 11\n |\n| ![](image) **Santa Barbara** | 1909\n | 26,420\n | $544 million\n | NCAA Div IBig West | Gauchos | 32\n | 57\n | 98\n | 39\n | 64\n | 163\n | 35\n | 67\n |\n| ![](image) **Santa Cruz** | 1965\n | 19,478\n | $269 million\n | NCAA Div IIIC2C | Banana Slugs | 55â62\n | 151â200\n | 306\n | 87\n | 192\n | 332\n | 82\n | 103\n |\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Doe Memorial Library, main facility of the UC Berkeley Libraries.\n![](image)Langson Library at UC Irvine.\nAs of 2021, UC controls over 13,308 active patents. UC researchers and faculty were responsible for 1,718 new inventions that same year.[2] On average, UC researchers create five new inventions per day.[2]\n\n\nEight of UC's ten campuses (Berkeley, UC Davis, UCI, UCLA, UC Riverside, UCSD, UC Santa Barbara, and UC Santa Cruz) are members of the Association of American Universities (AAU),[2] an alliance of elite American research universities[108] founded in 1900 at UC's suggestion.[109] Collectively, the system counts among its faculty (as of 2002):\n\n\n\n* 389 members of the Academy of Arts and Sciences\n* 5 Fields Medal recipients\n* 19 Fulbright Scholars\n* 25 MacArthur Fellows\n* 254 members of the National Academy of Sciences\n* 91 members of the National Academy of Engineering\n* 13 National Medal of Science laureates\n* 61 Nobel laureates[9]\n* 106 members of the Institute of Medicine\n\n\n### Nobel Prize winners[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Powell Library, main facility of the UCLA Library.\n![](image)Kolligian Library at UC Merced.\nAs of October 2021, the following data are taken from List of Nobel laureates by university affiliation, which counts university alumni and staff, and are not the official count from the University of California. \n\n\n\n\n\n| Campus\n | Nr. of winners\n | Founded\n | Nr. of Winners/\n10 years of age\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Berkeley | 110\n | 1868\n | 7.2\n |\n| San Diego | 28\n | 1960\n | 4.6\n |\n| Los Angeles | 27\n | 1919\n | 2.6\n |\n| Santa Barbara | 14\n | 1909\n | 1.8\n |\n| San Francisco | 10\n | 1864\n | 0.7\n |\n| Irvine | 7\n | 1965\n | 1.3\n |\n| Davis | 4\n | 1905\n | 0.3\n |\n| Riverside | 3\n | 1954\n | 0.4\n |\n| Santa Cruz | 1\n | 1965\n | 0.2\n |\n| Merced | 0\n | 2005\n | 0\n |\n\n\n### UC Libraries[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University of California Libraries\n\n![](image)Davidson Library, the main facility of the UC Santa Barbara Library.\nAt 40.8 million print volumes,[110] the University of California library system is home to one of the largest collections of printed materials in the world. On July 27, 2021, all ten campuses went live with a unified online library catalog, UC Library Search. Besides on-campus libraries, the UC system also maintains two regional library facilities (one each for Northern and Southern California), which each accept older items from all UC campus libraries in their respective region. As of 2019, Northern Regional Library Facility is home to 7.4 million items, while Southern Regional Library Facility is home to 6.5 million items.\n\n\n\n### Academic calendar[edit]\n\n\nEight campuses operate on the quarter system, while two (Berkeley and Merced) are on the semester system. However, all five law schools operate on the semester system, as does the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA.\n\n\n\n### Academic organization[edit]\n\n\n![](image)McHenry Library at UC Santa Cruz.\nDavis, Los Angeles, Riverside, and Santa Barbara all followed Berkeley's example by aggregating the majority of arts, humanities, and science departments into a relatively large College of Letters and Science. Therefore, at Berkeley, Davis, Los Angeles, and Santa Barbara, their respective College of Letters and Science is by far the single largest academic unit on each campus. The College of Letters and Science at Los Angeles is the largest academic unit in the entire UC system.[111] Riverside later separated the natural sciences and kept only social sciences grouped with arts and humanities, an example followed by Merced at its founding.\n\n\nDue to President Kerr's interest in not reproducing the impersonal undergraduate experience often seen in such gigantic academic units, San Diego and Santa Cruz both implemented residential college systems inspired by British models (in which each college has distinctive general education requirements reflecting its chosen theme)[112] and grouped most academic departments into a small number of broadly defined divisions which are all independent of the colleges.\n\n\nFinally, Irvine is organized into 13 schools and San Francisco is organized into four schools, all of which are relatively narrow in scope.\n\n\n\n## Admissions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kerckhoff Hall is home of the Associated Students of the University of California, Los Angeles.\nEach UC campus handles admissions separately, but a student wishing to apply for an undergraduate or transfer admission uses one application for all UC campuses. Graduate and professional school admissions are handled directly and separately by each department or program to which one applies.\n\n\nIn May 2020, UC approved plans to suspend standardized testing score requirements in admissions until 2024.[113] In May 2021, after a student lawsuit, the University of California announced that it would no longer consider SAT and ACT scores in admissions and scholarship decisions.[114]\n\n\nThe Early Academic Outreach Program (EAOP) was established in 1976 by University of California (UC) in response to the State Legislature's recommendation to expand post-secondary opportunities to all of California's students including those who are first-generation, socioeconomically disadvantaged, and English-language learners.[115] As UC's largest academic preparation program, EAOP assists middle and high school students with academic preparation, admissions requirements, and financial aid requirements for higher education.[116] The program designs and provides services to foster students' academic development, and delivers those services in partnership with other academic preparation programs, schools, other higher education institutions and community/industry partners.[117]\n\n\n\n![](image)Haas School of Business at Berkeley is ranked among the best business schools in the world.\nThe University of California admits a significant number of transfer students primarily from the California Community Colleges.[118] Approximately one out of three UC students begin at a community college before graduating.[118] In evaluating a transfer student's application the universities conduct a \"comprehensive review\" process that includes consideration of grade point averages of the generally required, transferable and or related courses for the intended major. The review may also include consideration of an applicant's enrollment in selective honor courses or programs, extracurricular activities, essay, family history, life challenges, and the location of the student's residence. Different universities emphasize different factors in their evaluations.[119]\n\n\n\n### Freshmen[edit]\n\n\nBefore 1986, students who wanted to apply to UC for undergraduate study could only apply to one campus. Students who were rejected at that campus but otherwise met the UC minimum eligibility requirements were *redirected* to another campus with available space.[120][121] Students who did not want to be redirected were refunded their application fees.[*citation needed*] UC Riverside chancellor Ivan Hinderaker explained in 1972: \"Redirection has been a negative rather than a plus. Some come with a chip on their shoulders so big they never give the campus a chance. They poison the attitudes of the students around them.\"[121]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jacobs School of Engineering, at San Diego, is one of the top-ranked engineering schools in the country.\nTherefore, in 1986, the undergraduate application system was changed to the current \"multiple filing\" system, in which students can apply to as many or as few UC campuses as they want on one application, paying a fee for each campus. This significantly increased the number of applications to the Berkeley and Los Angeles campuses, since students could choose a campus to attend after they received acceptance letters, without fear of being redirected to a campus they did not want to attend.[120]\n\n\nThe University of California accepts fully eligible students from among the top one-eighth (1/8) of California public high school graduates through regular statewide admission, or the top 9% of any given high school class through Eligibility in the Local Context (see below). Part of the eligibility process is completion of the A-G requirements in high school. All eligible California high school students who apply are accepted to the university, though not necessarily to the campus of choice.[122][123] Eligible students who are not accepted to the campus(es) of their choice are placed in the \"referral pool\", where campuses with open space may offer admission to those students; in 2003, 10% of students who received an offer through this referral process accepted it.[124] In 2007, about 4,100 UC-eligible students who were not offered admission to their campus of choice were referred to UC Riverside or the system's newest campus, UC Merced.[125] In 2015, all UC-eligible students rejected by their campus of choice were redirected to UC Merced, which is now the only campus that has space for all qualified applicants.[126]\n\n\n\n![](image)UCLA School of Law is one of the top ranked law schools in the United States.\nThe old undergraduate admissions were conducted on a two-phase basis. In the first phase, students were admitted based solely on academic achievement. This accounted for between 50 and 75% of the admissions. In the second phase, the university conducted a \"comprehensive review\" of the student's achievements, including extracurricular activities, essay, family history, and life challenges, to admit the remainder. Students who did not qualify for regular admission were \"admitted by exception\"; in 2002, approximately 2% of newly admitted undergraduates were admitted by exception.[127]\n\n\nThe process for determining admissions varies. At some campuses, such as Santa Barbara and Santa Cruz, a point system is used to weight grade point average, SAT Reasoning or ACT scores, and SAT Subject scores, while at San Diego, Berkeley, and Los Angeles, academic achievement is examined in the context of the school and the surrounding community, known as a holistic review.\n\n\nRace, gender, national origin, and ethnicity were not used as UC admission criteria due to the passing of Proposition 209. This information was collected for statistical purposes.\n\n\nEligibility in the Local Context, commonly referred to as ELC, is met by applicants ranked in the top 9% of their high school class in terms of performance on an 11-unit pattern of UC-approved high school courses. Beginning with fall 2007 applicants, ELC also requires a UC-calculated GPA of at least 3.0. Fully eligible ELC students are guaranteed a spot at one of UC's undergraduate campuses, though not necessarily at their first-choice campus or even to a campus to which they applied.[122]\n\n\nIn 2021, the University of California freshmen class was its most diverse and largest ever, with 84,223 students.[128] Latinos were the largest group at 37%; Asian Americans at 34%; white non-Hispanics at 20%; African-Americans at 5%; and 4% composed of American Indians, Pacific Islanders or those who declined to state their race or ethnicity.[128]\n\n\n\n### Student profile[edit]\n\n\n\n\nPercentage of students and comparisons statewide-nationwide\n|  | Campuses\n(2022)[129]\n | California\n(2022)[130]\n | United States\n(2022)[131]\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **African American** | 5% | 7% | 14%\n |\n| **American Indian** | 1% | 2% | 1%\n |\n| **Asian** | 32% | 16% | 6%\n |\n| **Hispanic/Latino(a)** (of any race; including Chicanos and White Hispanics)\n | 23% | 40% | 19%\n |\n| **Non-Hispanic White** | 22% | 35% | 59%\n |\n| **Pacific Islander** | (<1%)\n | 1%\n | (<1%)\n |\n| **International student** | 15% | N/A | N/A\n |\n| **Unknown** | 3% | N/A | N/A\n |\n\n\n### Admissions practices[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mrak Hall serves as the administrative seat of UC Davis.\nIn many recent years, the University of California has faced growing criticism for high admissions of out-of-state or international students as opposed to in-state, California students. In particular, UC Berkeley and UCLA have been heavily criticized for this phenomenon due to their extraordinarily low acceptance rates compared to other campuses in the system.[132] At a Board of Regents meeting in 2015, California Governor Jerry Brown reportedly said about the problem: \"And so you got your foreign students and you got your 4.0 folks, but just the kind of ordinary, normal students, you know, that got good grades but weren't at the top of the heap thereâthey're getting frozen out.\"[133] State lawmakers have proposed legislation that would reduce out-of-state admission.[134]\n\n\nA 2020 California auditor's report indicated that at least 64 wealthy students were wrongfully admitted to UC schools as favors to powerful figures.[135][136][137] Many of the admissions were justified by falsely classifying the applicants as student athletes. The incidents disproportionately (55 of 64) occurred at UC Berkeley.\n\n\n\n## Research[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology, jointly run by UC San Diego, UC Irvine, and UC Riverside.\nIn 2006 the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC) awarded the University of California the SPARC Innovator Award for its \"extraordinarily effective institution-wide vision and efforts to move scholarly communication forward\", including the 1997 founding (under then UC President Richard C. Atkinson) of the California Digital Library (CDL) and its 2002 launching of CDL's eScholarship, an institutional repository. The award also specifically cited the widely influential 2005 academic journal publishing reform efforts of UC faculty and librarians in \"altering the marketplace\" by publicly negotiating contracts with publishers, as well as their 2006 proposal to amend UC's copyright policy to allow open access to UC faculty research.[138]\n\n\nOn July 24, 2013, the UC Academic Senate adopted an Open Access Policy, mandating that all UC faculty produced research with a publication agreement signed after that date be first deposited in UC's eScholarship open access repository.[139]\n\n\nUniversity of California systemwide research on the SAT exam found that, after controlling for familial income and parental education, so-called achievement tests known as the SAT II had 10 times more predictive ability of college aptitude than the SAT I.[140]\n\n\n\n## Peripheral enterprises[edit]\n\n\nThe University of California has a long tradition of involvement in many enterprises that are often geographically or organizationally separate from its general campuses, including national laboratories, observatories, hospitals, continuing education programs, hotels, conference centers, an airport, a seaport, and an art institute.\n\n\n\n### National laboratories[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in the Berkeley Hills.\nThe University of California directly manages and operates one United States Department of Energy National Laboratory:[141]\n\n\n\n* Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL, or Berkeley Lab) (Berkeley, California)\n\n\nUC is a limited partner in two separate private limited liability companies that manage and operate two other Department of Energy national laboratories:\n\n\n\n* Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) (Los Alamos, New Mexico) operated by Los Alamos National Security, LLC.\n* Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) (Livermore, California) operated by Lawrence Livermore National Security, LLC.\n\n\n![](image)Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory staff on the magnet yoke for the 60-inch cyclotron, 1938; Nobel prize winners Ernest Lawrence, Edwin McMillan, and Luis Alvarez are shown, in addition to J. Robert Oppenheimer and Robert R. Wilson.\nThe **Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory** conducts unclassified research across a wide range of scientific disciplines with key efforts focused on fundamental studies of the universe, quantitative biology, nanoscience, new energy systems and environmental solutions, and the use of integrated computing as a tool for discovery.\n\n\n\n![](image)Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the Livermore Valley.\nThe **Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory** uses advanced science and technology to ensure that U.S. nuclear weapons remain reliable. LLNL also has major research programs in supercomputing and predictive modeling, energy and environment, bioscience and biotechnology, basic science and applied technology, counter-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and homeland security. It is also home to the most powerful supercomputers in the world.\n\n\nThe **Los Alamos National Laboratory** focuses most of its work on ensuring the reliability of U.S. nuclear weapons. Other work at LANL involves research programs into preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction and US national security, such as protection of the US homeland from terrorist attacks.\n\n\nThe UC system's ties to the three laboratories have occasionally sparked controversy and protest, because all three laboratories have been intimately linked with the development of nuclear weapons. During the World War II Manhattan Project, Lawrence Berkeley Lab developed the electromagnetic method for the separation of uranium isotopes used to develop the first atomic bombs. The Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore labs have been involved in designing U.S. nuclear weapons from their inception until the shift into stockpile stewardship after the end of the Cold War. Historically the two national laboratories in Berkeley and Livermore named after Ernest O. Lawrence, have had very close relationships on research projects, as well as sharing some business operations and staff. In fact, LLNL was not officially severed administratively from LBNL until the early 1970s. They also have much deeper ties to the university than the Los Alamos Lab, a fact seen in their respective original names; the University of California Berkeley Radiation Laboratory and the University of California Radiation Laboratory at Livermore.\n\n\n\n![](image)Lick Observatory, atop Mount Hamilton in the Diablo Range.\nThe UC system's ties to the labs have so far outlasted all periods of internal controversy. However, in 2003, the U.S. Department of Energy for the first time opened the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) contract for bidding by other vendors. UC entered into a partnership with Bechtel Corporation, BWXT, and the Washington Group International, and together they created a private company called Los Alamos National Security, LLC (LANS). The only other bidder on the LANL contract was a Lockheed Martin Corporation-created company that included, among others, the University of Texas System. In December 2005, a seven-year contract to manage the laboratory was awarded to the Los Alamos National Security, LLC.[142] On October 1, 2007, the University of California ended its direct involvement in operating the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Management of the laboratory was taken over by Lawrence Livermore National Security, LLC, a limited liability company whose members are Bechtel National, the University of California, Babcock & Wilcox, the Washington Division of URS Corporation, Battelle Memorial Institute, and The Texas A&M University System. Other than UC appointing three members to the two separate boards of directors (each with eleven members) that oversee LANS and LLNS, UC now has virtually no responsibility for or direct involvement in either LANL or LLNL. UC policies and regulations that apply to UC campuses and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California no longer apply to LANL and LLNL, and the LANL and LLNL directors no longer report to the UC Regents or UC Office of the President.\n\n\n\n### Observatories[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Keck Observatory, atop Mauna Kea volcano on the Big Island of Hawaii.\nThe University of California manages two observatories as a multi-campus research unit headquartered at UC Santa Cruz.\n\n\n\n* Lick Observatory atop Mount Hamilton, in the Diablo Range just east of San Jose.\n* Keck Observatory at the 4,145 meters (13,599 feet) summit of Mauna Kea in Hawaii.\n\n\nThe Astronomy Department at the Berkeley campus manages the Hat Creek Radio Observatory in Shasta County.\n\n\n\n### High-performance networking[edit]\n\n\nThe University of California is a founding and charter member of the Corporation for Education Network Initiatives in California, a nonprofit organization that provides high-performance Internet-based networking to California's K-20 research and education community.\n\n\n\n### UC Natural Reserve System[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University of California Natural Reserve System\n\nThe NRS was established in January 1965 to provide UC faculty with large areas of land where they could conduct long-term ecosystem research without having to worry about outside disturbances like tourists. Today, the NRS manages 39 reserves that total more than 756,000 acres (3,060Â km2).\n\n\n\n* Selected reserves of the University of California Natural Reserve System\n* ![Coal Oil Point Reserve](image)\n\nCoal Oil Point Reserve\n* ![Rancho Marino Reserve](image)\n\nRancho Marino Reserve\n* ![Stebbins Cold Canyon Reserve](image)\n\nStebbins Cold Canyon Reserve\n* ![Younger Lagoon Reserve](image)\n\nYounger Lagoon Reserve\n* ![Bodega Marine Reserve](image)\n\nBodega Marine Reserve\n\n\n### UC Agriculture and Natural Resources[edit]\n\n\nUniversity of California Agriculture and Natural Resources[143] (UCANR, Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources) plays an important role in the state's agriculture industry, as mandated by UC's legacy as a land-grant institution. In addition to conducting agriculture and Youth development research, every county in the state has a cooperative extension office with county farm advisors. The county offices also support 4-H programs and have nutrition, family, and consumer sciences advisors who assist local government. Currently, the division's University of California 4-H Youth Development Program[144] is a national leader in studying thriving in the field of youth development.[145]\n\n\n\n### Other national research centers[edit]\n\n\nFrom September 2003 to July 2016, UC managed a contract valued at more than $330 million to establish and operate a University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) at the NASA Ames Research Center at Moffett Federal Airfield âthe largest grant ever awarded the university. UC Santa Cruz managed the UARC for the University of California, with the goal of increasing the science output, safety, and effectiveness of NASA's missions through new technologies and scientific techniques.\n\n\nSince 2002, the NSF-funded San Diego Supercomputer Center at UC San Diego has been managed by the University of California, which took over from the previous manager, General Atomics.\n\n\n\n### Medical centers and schools[edit]\n\n\n![](image)UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital.\nThe University of California operates five medical centers throughout the state:\n\n\n\n* UC Davis Medical Center, in Sacramento;\n* UC Irvine Medical Center, in Orange;\n* UCLA Medical Center, comprising two distinct hospitals:\n\t+ Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, in Los Angeles;\n\t+ UCLA Santa Monica Medical Center, in Santa Monica;\n* UC San Diego Medical Center, comprising two distinct hospitals:\n\t+ UC San Diego Medical Center, Hillcrest, in San Diego;\n\t+ Jacobs Medical Center, in La Jolla; and\n* UCSF Medical Center, operating as a single medical center across three physically distinct campuses around San Francisco.\n\n\n* Medical centers of the University of California\n* ![UCD Medical Center](image)\n\nUCD Medical Center\n* ![UCSD Medical Center](image)\n\nUCSD Medical Center\n* ![UCLA Medical Center](image)\n\nUCLA Medical Center\n* ![UCSF Medical Center](image)\n\nUCSF Medical Center\n* ![UCI Medical Center](image)\n\nUCI Medical Center\n\n\nThere are two medical centers that bear the UCLA name, but are not operated by UCLA: HarborâUCLA Medical Center and Olive ViewâUCLA Medical Center. They are actually Los Angeles County-operated facilities that UCLA uses as teaching hospitals.\n\n\n\n![](image)UCLA Mattel Children's Hospital.\nEach medical center serves as the primary teaching site for that campus's medical school. UCSF is perennially among the top five programs in both research and primary care, and both UCLA and UC San Diego consistently rank among the top fifteen research schools, according to annual rankings published by *U.S. News & World Report*.[146] The teaching hospitals affiliated with each school are also highly regarded â the UCSF Medical Center was ranked the number one hospital in California and number 5 in the country by *U.S. News & World Report*'s 2017 Honor Roll for Best Hospitals in the United States.[147] UC also has a sixth medical schoolâUC Riverside School of Medicine, the only one in the UC system without its own hospital.\n\n\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, the UC hospitals became the cores of full-fledged regional health systems; they were gradually supplemented by many outpatient clinics, offices, and institutes. Three UC hospitals are actually county hospitals that were sold to UC, which means that UC currently plays a major role in providing healthcare to the indigent. The medical hospitals operated by UC Irvine (acquired in 1976), UC Davis (acquired in 1978), and UC San Diego (acquired in 1984) each began as the respective county hospitals of Orange County, Sacramento County, and San Diego County. As of 2021, UC medical centers handle each year about 8.1 million outpatient visits, 349,074 emergency room visits, and roughly 1.1 million inpatient days.[2]\n\n\n\n### Facilities outside of California[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Casa de California in Mexico City.\nUC operates several other miscellaneous sites to support faculty, students, and researchers away from its general campuses:\n\n\n\n* The UC Office of the President's Education Abroad Program currently operates one mini-campus which supports UC students, faculty, and alumni overseas:\n\t+ Casa de California in Mexico City.\n\t+ EAP also briefly operated California House in London during the early-to-mid 2000s.\n* UC Washington Center in Washington, D.C., with a dormitory for students interning with the federal government.\n\t+ UC Davis's UC Center Sacramento supports students interning with the California government.\n* UC Berkeley operates the Richard B. Gump South Pacific Research Station in Mo'orea, French Polynesia on land donated in 1981 by the heir to the founder of the Gump's home furnishings store.[148]\n\n\n### Hospitality facilities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Scripps Institution of Oceanography pier, in La Jolla.\nUnlike other land-grant institutions (e.g., Cornell) UC does not provide a hospitality management program, but it does provide general hospitality at some locations: \n\n\n\n* UC Berkeley's Cal Alumni Association operates travel excursions for alumni (and their families) under its \"Cal Discoveries Travel\" brand (formerly BearTreks); many of the tour guides are Berkeley professors. CAA also operates the oldest and largest alumni association-run family camp in the world, the Lair of the Golden Bear. Located at an altitude of 5600 feet in Pinecrest, California, the Lair is a home-away-from-home for almost 10,000 campers annually. Its attendees are largely Cal alumni and their families, but the Lair is open to everyone.\n* Berkeley Lab operates its own hotel, the Berkeley Lab Guest House, available to persons with business at the Lab itself or UC Berkeley.\n* UCLA Housing & Hospitality Services operates two on-campus hotels, the 61-room Guest House and the 254-room Meyer & Renee Luskin Conference Center, and a lavish off-campus conference center at Lake Arrowhead (with a mix of chalet-like condominiums, lodge rooms, and stand-alone cottages). During the summer, the Lake Arrowhead conference center hosts the Bruin Woods vacation programs for UCLA alumni and their families.\n* Separately, UCLA Health operates the 100-room Tiverton House just south of the UCLA campus to serve its patients and their families.\n* UC Santa Cruz leased the University Inn and Conference Center in downtown Santa Cruz from 2001 to 2011 for use as off-campus student housing.\n\n\n### University Airport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)University of California Museum of Paleontology in Berkeley.\nUC Davis operates the University Airport as a utility airport for air shuttle service in the contractual transportation of university employees and agricultural samples. It is also a public general aviation airport. University Airport's ICAO identifier is KEDU.\n\n\n\n### Seaport[edit]\n\n\nUC San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography owns a seaport, the Nimitz Marine Facility, which is just south of Shelter Island on Point Loma, San Diego. The port is used as an operating base for all of its oceanographic vessels and platforms.\n\n\n\n### UC Extension[edit]\n\n\nFor over a century, the university has operated a continuing education program for working adults and professionals. At present, UC Extension enrolls over 500,000 students each year in over 17,000 courses. One of the reasons for its large size is that UC Extension is a dominant provider of Continuing Legal Education and Continuing Medical Education in California. For example, the systemwide portion of UC Extension (directly controlled by the UC Office of the President) operates Continuing Education of the Bar under a joint venture agreement with the State Bar of California.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)California portal\n* ![](image)San Francisco Bay Area portal\n\n\n* Police departments at the University of California\n* University of California Press\n* University of California Student Association\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** As of June 30, 2022; includes assets managed by UC Regents on behalf of all UC campuses. \"Annual Endowment Report for the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022\" (PDF).

It was founded in 1819 by Thomas Jefferson. The university is set within the Academical Village, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\nThe original governing Board of Visitors included three U.S. presidents: Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and James Monroe, the latter as sitting president of the United States at the time of its foundation. As its first two rectors, Presidents Jefferson and Madison played key roles in the university's foundation, with Jefferson designing both the original courses of study and the university's architecture. Located within its historic 1,135 acre central campus, the university is composed of eight undergraduate and three professional schools: the School of Law, the Darden School of Business, and the School of Medicine.[10]\n\n\nThe University of Virginia's scholars have played a major role in the development of many academic disciplines, including economics,[c] law,[d] literary art,[e] visual art,[f] and the sciences.[11] The university is referred to as a \"Public Ivy\" for offering an academic experience similar to that of an Ivy League university. Admission to the university is considered highly selective, and the university is known in part for its historic foundations, student-run honor code, and secret societies.[12][13][14] In research, the university has been a member of the Association of American Universities for 119â120 years, and the journal *Science* credited its faculty with two of the top ten global scientific breakthroughs in a single year.[11] In sports, the university athletic teams are called the Cavaliers and lead the Atlantic Coast Conference in team NCAA Championships for men's sports, also ranking second in women's and overall titles. In 2015, and again in 2019, the University of Virginia was presented with the Capital One Cup for fielding the nation's best overall athletics programs for men's sports.[15][16]\n\n\nThe university's alumni, faculty, and researchers have included several U.S. presidents, heads of state, Nobel laureates, Pulitzer Prize winners, Rhodes Scholars, Marshall Scholars, and Fulbright Scholars. Some 30 different governors of U.S. states have attended the university, as have numerous U.S. senators and members of Congress. UVA has produced 55 Rhodes Scholars, eighth most in the United States, while its alumni have founded companies such as Reddit, CNET, and Space Adventures.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the University of Virginia\n\n### 1800s[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Thomas Jefferson, the university's founder, by Charles Willson Peale (1791)\n![](image)The Rotunda, as pictured from the South LawnIn 1802, while serving as president of the United States, Thomas Jefferson wrote to artist Charles Willson Peale that his concept of the new university would be \"on the most extensive and liberal scale that our circumstances would call for and our faculties meet,\" and it might even attract talented students from \"other states to come, and drink of the cup of knowledge.\"[17] Virginia was already home to the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, but Jefferson lost all confidence in his *alma mater,* partly because of its religious natureâit required all its students to recite a catechismâand its stifling of the sciences.[18][19] Jefferson had flourished under William & Mary professors William Small and George Wythe decades earlier, but the college was in a period of great decline and his concern became so dire by 1800 that he expressed to British chemist Joseph Priestley, \"we have in that State, a college just well enough endowed to draw out the miserable existence to which a miserable constitution has doomed it.\" Instead, Jefferson sought to found the new university on the Humboldtian model of higher education, enlarging the scope of training beyond the relatively narrow, specialized focus of contemporary universities, to cultivate a more well-rounded student, educated in multiple disciplines (e.g., arts and sciences) simultaneously, a view that promoted the modern \"Liberal Arts\" curriculum offered at almost all public universities.[18][20][21][22] These words would ring true some seventy years later when William & Mary fell bankrupt after the Civil War and the Williamsburg college was shuttered completely in 1881, later being revived as primarily a small college for teachers until it regained University status later in the twentieth century.[23]\n\n\nIn 1817, three presidents (Jefferson, James Monroe, and James Madison) and Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court John Marshall joined 24 other dignitaries at a meeting held in the Mountain Top Tavern at Rockfish Gap. After some deliberation, they selected nearby Charlottesville as the site of the new University of Virginia.[24] Farmland just outside Charlottesville was purchased from James Monroe by the Board of Visitors for construction of a newly chartered regional school to be known as *Central College,* which itself was an institutional successor to Albemarle Academy though neither school would ever open for instruction. The school laid its first building's cornerstone late in that same year, and the ongoing building of the Academical Village proved influential as the Commonwealth of Virginia chartered a new flagship university to be based on the site in Charlottesville on January 25, 1819. John Hartwell Cocke collaborated with James Madison, Monroe, and Joseph Carrington Cabell to fulfill Jefferson's dream to establish the university. Cocke and Jefferson were appointed to the building committee to supervise the construction.[25] The university was built on Monacan Indian Nation tribal land. UVA is continuing to \"seek opportunities to engage and acknowledge with respect that we live, learn, and work on the territory of the Monacan Indian Nation\"[26] Like many of its peers,[27] the university owned slaves who helped build the campus.[28] They also served students and professors.[28] The university's first classes met on March 7, 1825.[29]\n\n\nIn contrast to other universities of the day, at which one could study in either medicine, law, or divinity, the first students at the University of Virginia could study in one or several of eight independent schools â medicine, law, mathematics, chemistry, ancient languages, modern languages, natural philosophy, and moral philosophy.[30] Another innovation of the new university was that higher education would be separated from religious doctrine. UVA had no divinity school, was established independently of any religious sect, and the Grounds were planned and centered upon a library, the Rotunda, rather than a church, distinguishing it from peer universities still primarily functioning as seminaries for one particular strain of Protestantism or another.[31] Jefferson opined to philosopher Thomas Cooper that \"a professorship of theology should have no place in our institution\", and never has there been one. There were initially two degrees awarded by the university: *Graduate,* to a student who had completed the courses of one school; and *Doctor* to a graduate in more than one school who had shown research prowess.[32]\n\n\n\n![](image)James Madison was the second rector of the University of Virginia until 1836.\nJefferson was intimately involved in the university to the end, hosting Sunday dinners at his Monticello home for faculty and students. Jefferson viewed the university's foundation as having such great importance and potential that he counted it among his greatest accomplishments and insisted his grave mention only his status as author of the Declaration of Independence and Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, and father of the University of Virginia. Thus, he eschewed mention of his national accomplishments, such as the Louisiana Purchase and any other aspects of his presidency, in favor of his role with the young university.\n\n\nInitially, some of the students arriving at the university matched the then-common picture of college students: wealthy, spoiled aristocrats with a sense of privilege which often led to brawling, or worse. This was a source of frustration for Jefferson, who assembled the students during the school's first year, on October 3, 1825, to criticize such behavior; but was too overcome to speak. He later spoke of this moment as \"the most painful event\" of his life.[33]\n\n\nAlthough the frequency of such irresponsible behavior dropped after Jefferson's expression of concern, it did not die away completely. Like many universities and colleges, it experienced periodic student riots, culminating in the shooting death of Professor John A. G. Davis, Chairman of the Faculty, in 1840. This event, in conjunction with the growing popularity of temperance and a rise in religious affiliation in society in general, seems to have resulted in a permanent change in student attitudes, and the behavior among students that had so greatly bothered Jefferson finally vanished.[33]\n\n\nIn the year of Jefferson's death in 1826, poet Edgar Allan Poe enrolled at the university, where he excelled in Latin.[34] The Raven Society, an organization named after Poe's most famous poem, continues to maintain 13 West Range, the room Poe inhabited during the single semester he attended the university.[35] He left because of financial difficulties. The School of Engineering and Applied Science opened in 1836, making UVA the first comprehensive university to open an engineering school.\n\n\nUnlike the majority of Southern colleges, the university was kept open throughout the Civil War, despite its state seeing more bloodshed than any other and the near 100% conscription of the American South.[36] After Jubal Early's total loss at the Battle of Waynesboro, Charlottesville was willingly surrendered to Union forces to avoid mass bloodshed, and UVA faculty convinced George Armstrong Custer to preserve Jefferson's university.[37] Although Union troops camped on the Lawn and damaged many of the Pavilions, Custer's men left four days later without bloodshed and the university was able to return to its educational mission. However, an extremely high number of officers of both Confederacy and Union were alumni.[38] UVA produced 1,481 officers in the Confederate Army alone, including four major-generals, twenty-one brigadier-generals, and sixty-seven colonels from ten different states.[38] John S. Mosby, the infamous \"Gray Ghost\" and commander of the lightning-fast 43rd Battalion Virginia Cavalry ranger unit, had also been a UVA student.\n\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikisource has the text of an 1879 *American CyclopÃ¦dia* article about ***UVA's 16 schools in operation as of 1879***.\n\nThanks to a grant from the Commonwealth of Virginia, tuition became free for all Virginians in the year 1875.[39] During this period, the University of Virginia remained unique in that it had no president and mandated no core curriculum from its students, who often studied in and took degrees from more than one school.[39] However, the university was also experiencing growing pains. As the original Rotunda caught fire and was gutted in 1895, there would soon be sweeping changes, much greater than merely reconstructing the Rotunda in 1899.\n\n\n\n### 1900s[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Edwin Alderman was UVA's first president between 1904 and 1931, and instituted many reforms toward modernization.\n![](image)\n\nWikisource has original text related to this article:\n**July 1905 *Popular Science* article about UVA taking a President**\n\nJefferson had originally decided the University of Virginia would have no serving president. Rather, this power was to be shared by a rector and the Board of Visitors. But as the 19th century waned, it became obvious this cumbersome arrangement was incapable of adequately handling the many administrative and fundraising tasks of the growing university.[40] Edwin Alderman, who had only recently moved from his post as president of UNC-Chapel Hill since 1896 to become president of Tulane University in 1900, accepted an offer as president of the University of Virginia in 1904. His appointment was not without controversy, and national media such as *Popular Science* lamented the end of one of the things that made UVA unique among universities.[41]\n\n\nAlderman stayed 27 years, and became known as a prolific fund-raiser, a well-known orator, and a close adviser to U.S. president and UVA alumnus Woodrow Wilson.[40] He added significantly to the University Hospital to support new sickbeds and public health research, and helped create departments of geology and forestry, the School of Education and Human Development (originally the Curry School of Education), the McIntire School of Commerce, and the summer school programs in which young Georgia O'Keeffe took part.[42] Perhaps his greatest ambition was the funding and construction of a library on a scale of millions of books, much larger than the Rotunda could bear. Delayed by the Great Depression, Alderman Library was named in his honor in 1938. Alderman, who seven years earlier had died in office en route to giving a public speech at the University of Illinois at UrbanaâChampaign, is still the longest-tenured president of the university.\n\n\nIn 1904, UVA became the first university south of Washington, D.C. to be elected to the Association of American Universities. After a gift by Andrew Carnegie in 1909 the University of Virginia was organized into twenty-six departments across six schools including the Andrew Carnegie School of Engineering, the James Madison School of Law, the James Monroe School of International Law, the James Wilson School of Political Economy, the Edgar Allan Poe School of English and the Walter Reed School of Pathology.[32] The honorific historical names for these schools â several of which have remained as modern schools of the university â are no longer used.\n\n\nIn December 1953, the University of Virginia joined the Atlantic Coast Conference for athletics. At the time, UVA had a football program that had just broken through to be nationally ranked in 1950, 1951, and 1952, and consistently beat its rivals North Carolina and Virginia Tech by scores such as 34â7 and 44â0. Other sports were very competitive as well. However, the administration of Colgate Darden de-emphasized athletics, defunding the department and declining to join the ACC before being overruled by the Board of Visitors on that decision. It would take until the 1980s for the bulk of athletics programs to fully recover, but approaching the year 2000 UVA was again one of the most successful all-around sports programs with NCAA national titles achieved in an array of different sports; by 2020, it had twice won the Capital One Cup for overall athletics excellence in men's sports programs.\n\n\nUVA established a junior college in 1954, known today as the University of Virginia's College at Wise. George Mason University and the aforementioned Mary Washington University used to exist as similar satellite campuses, but those are now wholly self-administered schools.\n\n\nThe Academical Village and nearby Monticello became a joint World Heritage Site in 1987. Simultaneously with HawaiÊ»i Volcanoes National Park and Chaco Culture National Historical Park, they were the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth U.S. sites designated as culturally significant to the collective interests of global humanity, coming after the Statue of Liberty and Yosemite National Park three years earlier. As such, UVA possesses the only U.S. collegiate grounds to be internationally protected by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).\n\n\n\n#### Integration, coeducation, and student dissent[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Virginia first admitted a few selected women to graduate studies in the late 1890s and to certain programs such as nursing and education in the 1920s and 1930s.[43] In 1944, Mary Washington College in Fredericksburg, Virginia, became the Women's Undergraduate Arts and Sciences Division of the University of Virginia. With this branch campus in Fredericksburg exclusively for women, UVA maintained its main campus in Charlottesville as near-exclusively for men, until a civil rights lawsuit in the 1960s forced it to commingle the sexes.[44] In 1970, the Charlottesville campus became fully co-educational, and in 1972 Mary Washington became an independent state university.[45] When the first female class arrived, 450 undergraduate women entered UVA, comprising 39 percent of undergraduates, while the number of men admitted remained constant. By 1999, women made up a 52 percent majority of the total student body.[43][46]\n\n\nThe university admitted its first black student when Gregory Swanson sued to gain entrance into the university's law school in 1950.[47] Following his successful lawsuit, a handful of black graduate and professional students were admitted during the 1950s, though no black undergraduates were admitted until 1955, and UVA did not fully integrate until the 1960s.[47] When Walter Ridley graduated with a doctorate in education, he was the first black person to graduate from UVA.[47] UVA's Ridley Scholarship Fund is named in his honor.[47]\n\n\nThe fight for integration and coeducation came to the foreground particularly in the late 1960s, leading up to the May Strike of 1970, in which students protested for higher black enrollment, equal access to UVA admission by undergraduate women, unionization of employees, and against the presence of armed university police and recruiters of government agencies such as the CIA and FBI on Grounds.[48]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)President Sullivan speaking with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in front of the Rotunda in February 2013\nDue to a continual decline in state funding for the university, today only 6 percent of its budget comes from the Commonwealth of Virginia.[49] A Charter initiative was signed into law by then-Governor Mark Warner in 2005, negotiated with the university to have greater autonomy over its own affairs in exchange for accepting this decline in financial support.[50][51]\n\n\nThe university welcomed Teresa A. Sullivan as its first female president in 2010.[52] Just two years later its first woman rector, Helen Dragas, engineered a forced-resignation to remove President Sullivan from office.[53][54] The attempted ouster elicited a faculty Senate vote of no confidence in Rector Dragas, and demands from student government for an explanation.[55][56] In the face of mounting pressure including alumni threats to cease contributions, and a mandate from then-Governor Robert McDonnell to resolve the issue or face removal of the entire Board of Visitors, the Board unanimously reinstated President Sullivan.[57][58][59] In 2013 and 2014, the Board passed new bylaws that made it harder to remove a president and possible to remove a rector.[60]\n\n\nIn November 2014, the university suspended fraternity and sorority functions pending investigation of an article by *Rolling Stone* concerning an alleged rape story, which was later determined to be a hoax after the story was confirmed to be false through investigation by *The Washington Post*.[61][62][63] The university nonetheless instituted new rules banning \"pre-mixed drinks, punches or any other common source of alcohol\" such as beer kegs and requiring \"sober and lucid\" fraternity members to monitor all parties.[64] In April 2015, *Rolling Stone* fully retracted the article after the Columbia School of Journalism released a report of what went wrong with the article in a scathing and discrediting report.[65][66] Even before release of the Columbia University report, the *Rolling Stone* story was named the \"Error of the Year\" by the Poynter Institute.[67] The UVA chapter of Phi Kappa Psi settled a defamation suit against *Rolling Stone* and received $1.65Â million.[68]\n\n\nIn August 2017, the night before the infamous Unite the Right rally, a group of non-student and mostly non-Virginian white nationalists marched on the university's Lawn bearing torches and chanting antisemitic and Nazi slogans after the city of Charlottesville decided to remove all remaining Confederate statues from the city including one depicting Robert E. Lee.[69][70] They were met by student counter-protesters near the statue of Thomas Jefferson in front of the Rotunda, where a fight broke out.\n\n\nJames E. Ryan, a graduate of the University of Virginia School of Law, became the university's ninth president in August 2018.[71] His first act upon his inauguration was to announce that in-state undergraduates from families making less than $80,000 per year would receive full scholarships covering tuition, and those from families making under $30,000 would also receive free room and board.[72] Ryan was previously dean of the Harvard School of Education.\n\n\nOn the night of November 13, 2022, three students were killed and two others injured in a shooting on a charter bus that was returning to the campus from a play for a class trip in Washington, D.C.[73] All three fatalities were current members of the Virginia Cavaliers football team[74] and the alleged shooter was briefly a member of the team during the 2018 season.[75]\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Rotunda, as painted by American modernist painter Georgia O'Keeffe in the early 1910s when she was a Summer Session student\nThe UVA campus, referred to as the Grounds,[76] straddles the border between the city of Charlottesville and Albemarle County.[77] The university also maintains 562 acres north of the campus at North Fork and 2,913 acres southeast of the city at Morven Farm.[78][79][6][14] It also is in the process of building a campus in Northern Virginia within Fairfax, Virginia.[80]\n\n\n\n### Academical Village[edit]\n\n\nSee also: The Lawn, The Rotunda, and The Range\n\nThroughout its history, the University of Virginia has won praise for its unique Jeffersonian architecture. In January 1895, less than a year before the Great Rotunda Fire, *The New York Times* said the design of the University of Virginia \"was incomparably the most ambitious and monumental architectural project that had or has yet been conceived in this century.\"[81] In the United States Bicentennial issue of their *AIA Journal*, the American Institute of Architects called it \"the proudest achievement of American architecture in the past 200 years.\"[82] The Academical Village, together with Jefferson's home at Monticello, which he also designed, is a World Heritage Site. The first collegiate architecture and culture World Heritage Site in the world, it was listed by UNESCO in 1987.[14][83]\n\n\nJefferson's original architectural design revolves around the *Academical Village*, and that name remains in use today to describe both the specific area of the Lawn, a grand, terraced green space surrounded by residential and academic buildings, the gardens, the Range, and the larger university surrounding it. The principal building of the design, the Rotunda, stands at the north end of the Lawn, and is the most recognizable symbol of the university. It is half the height and width of the Pantheon in Rome, which was the primary inspiration for the building. The Lawn and the Rotunda were the models for many similar designs of \"centralized green areas\" at universities across the country. The space was designed for students and professors to live in the same area. The Rotunda, which symbolized knowledge, showed hierarchy. The south end of the Lawn was left open to symbolize the view of cultivated fields to the south, as reflective of Jefferson's ideal for an agrarian-focused nation.\n\n\nMost notably designed by inspiration of the Rotunda and Lawn are the expansive green spaces headed by similar buildings built at: Duke University in 1892; Columbia University in 1895; Johns Hopkins University in 1902; Rice University in 1910; Peabody College of Vanderbilt University in 1915; Killian Court at MIT in 1916; the Grand Auditorium of Tsinghua University built in 1917 in Beijing, China; the Sterling Quad of Yale Divinity School in 1932; and the university's own Darden School in 1996.\n\n\n\n![](image)Winter view toward the South Lawn\nFlanking both sides of the Rotunda and extending down the length of the Lawn are ten Pavilions interspersed with student housing rooms. Each has its own classical architectural style, as well as its own walled garden separated by Jeffersonian Serpentine walls. These walls are called \"serpentine\" because they run a sinusoidal course, one that lends strength to the wall and allows for the wall to be only one brick thick, one of many innovations by which Jefferson attempted to combine aesthetics with utility.[84]\n\n\nOn October 27, 1895, the Rotunda burned to a shell because of an electrical fire that started in the Rotunda Annex, a long multi-story structure built in 1853 to house additional classrooms. The electrical fire was no doubt assisted by the help of overzealous faculty member William \"Reddy\" Echols, who attempted to save it by throwing roughly 100 pounds (45Â kg) of dynamite into the main fire in the hopes the blast would separate the burning Annex from Jefferson's own Rotunda. His last-ditch effort ultimately failed. Perhaps ironically, one of the university's main honors student programs is named for him. University officials swiftly approached celebrity architect Stanford White to rebuild the Rotunda. White took the charge further, disregarding Jefferson's design and redesigning the Rotunda interiorâmaking it two floors instead of three, adding three buildings to the foot of the Lawn, and designing a president's house. He did omit rebuilding the Rotunda Annex, the remnants of which were used as fill and to create part of the modern-day Rotunda's northern-facing plaza. The classes formerly occupying the Annex were moved to the South Lawn in White's new buildings.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe White buildings have the effect of closing off the sweeping perspective, as originally conceived by Jefferson, down the Lawn across open countryside toward the distant mountains. The White buildings at the foot of the Lawn effectively create a huge \"quadrangle\", albeit one far grander than any traditional college quadrangle at the University of Cambridge or University of Oxford.\n\n\nIn concert with the United States Bicentennial in 1976, Stanford White's changes to the Rotunda were removed and the building was returned to Jefferson's original design. Renovated according to original sketches and historical photographs, a three-story Rotunda opened on Jefferson's birthday, April 13, 1976. Queen Elizabeth II came to visit the Rotunda in that same year for the Bicentennial, and had a well-publicized stroll of the Lawn. The university was listed by *Travel + Leisure* in September 2011 as one of the most beautiful campuses in the United States and by MSN as one of the most beautiful college campuses in the world.[85][86]\n\n\n\n### Libraries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Inside the Law Library\nThe first library at the University of Virginia was the Rotunda. Rather than a chapel or other religious structure, the university was built around its own library. Thomas Jefferson was deeply engaged in selecting the materials that made up that library's original collection, and in developing the system by which it would be organized. The Rotunda served as the University Library for over a century, until Alderman Library was opened in 1937.[87]\n\n\nThe University of Virginia Library System consists of a dozen libraries and holds over 5Â million volumes. Its Electronic Text Center, established in 1992, has put 70,000 books online as well as 350,000 images that go with them. These e-texts are open to anyone and, as of 2002[update], were receiving 37,000 daily visits (compared to 6,000 daily visitors to the physical libraries).[88] Alderman Library holds the most extensive Tibetan collection in the world, and holds ten floors of book \"stacks\" of varying ages and historical value. The Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library features a collection of American literature as well as two copies of the original printing of the Declaration of Independence. It was in this library in 2006 that Robert Stilling, an English graduate student, discovered an unpublished Robert Frost poem from 1918.[89] Clark Hall is the library for SEAS (the engineering school), and one of its notable features is the Mural Room, decorated by two three-panel murals by Allyn Cox, depicting the Moral Law and the Civil Law. The murals were finished and set in place in 1934.[90] As of 2006[update], the university and Google were working on the digitization of selected collections from the library system.[91]\n\n\nSince 1992, the University of Virginia also hosts the Rare Book School, a non-profit organization in the study of historical books and the history of printing that began at Columbia University in 1983.\n\n\n\n### Other areas[edit]\n\n\nHousing for first-year students, Brown College, the School of Engineering and Applied Science and the University of Virginia Medical School are near the historic Lawn and Range area. The McIntire School of Commerce is on the actual Lawn, in Rouss-Roberston Hall.\n\n\n\n![](image)Recessed windows of the monolithic Hereford College\nAway from the historic area, UVA's architecture and its allegiance to the Jeffersonian design are controversial. The 1990s saw the construction of two deeply contrasting visions: the Williams Tsien post-modernist Hereford College in 1992 and the unapologetically Jeffersonian Darden School of Business in 1996. Commentary on both was broad and partisan, as the University of Virginia School of Architecture and *The New York Times* lauded Hereford for its bold new lines, while some independent press and wealthy donors praised the traditional design of the Darden school.[92][93] The latter group appeared to have the upper hand when the South Lawn Project was designed in the early 2000s.[93][94]\n\n\nBillionaire John Kluge donated 7,379 acres (29.86Â km2) of additional lands to the university in 2001. Kluge desired the core of the land, the 2,913-acre Morven, to be developed by the university and the surrounding land to be sold to fund an endowment supporting the core. Five farms totaling 1,261 acres (510Â ha) of the gift were soon sold to musician Dave Matthews, of the Dave Matthews Band, to be used in an organic farming project to complement his nearby Blenheim Vineyards.[95] Morven has since hosted the Morven Summer Institute, a rigorous immersion program of study in civil society, sustainability, and creativity.[96] As of 2014[update], the university is developing further plans for Morven and has hired an architecture firm for the nearly three thousand acre property.[96] In addition, the UVA Foundation owns the building and grounds of the Kluge-Ruhe Aboriginal Art Collection. The Collection itself is also owned by the University of Virginia.[97]\n\n\n\n### Student housing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)54 students are selected to live on the Lawn during their final year.\nThe primary housing areas for first-year students are McCormick Road Dormitories, often called \"Old Dorms\", Alderman Road Dormitories, often called \"New Dorms,\" and suite style dorms located off of Alderman road near the football stadium. The 1970s-era Alderman Road Dorms are being fully replaced with brand new dormitory buildings in the same area. The replacements feature hall-style living arrangements with common areas and many modern amenities. Instead of being torn down and replaced like the original New Dorms, the Old Dorms have seen a $105Â million renovation project between 2017 and 2022.[98] They were constructed in 1950, and are also hall-style constructions but with fewer amenities. The Old Dorms are closer to the students' classes.\n\n\nIn the 1980s, in response to a housing shortage, the Stadium Road Residential Area was built to the south of the Alderman Road Dormitories.[99] The largest of the houses in this area are the Gooch Dillard Residence Halls which house 610 students and are suite style type dorms.\n\n\nThere are three residential colleges at the university: Brown College, Hereford College, and the International Residential College. These involve an application process to live there, and are filled with both upperclass and first-year students. The application process can be extremely competitive, especially for Brown because of its location in central Grounds near classroom buildings, libraries, and Newcomb Hall.\n\n\nIt is considered a great honor and privilege to be invited to live on the Lawn, and 54 fourth-year undergraduates do so each year, joining ten members of the faculty who permanently live and teach in the Pavilions there.[100] Similarly, graduate students may live on the Range. Edgar Allan Poe formerly lived in 13 West Range, and since 1904 the Raven Society has retrofitted and preserved his room much as it may have existed back in the 1820s.\n\n\n\n## Organization and administration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikisource has the text of a 1911 *EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica* article about circa 1911 organization of the university.\n\nThe university has several affiliated centers including the Rare Book School, headquarters of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, University of Virginia Miller Center for Politics, Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service, Sorensen Institute for Political Leadership, Institute for Advanced Studies in Culture, and Miller Center of Public Affairs. The Fralin Museum of Art is dedicated to creating an environment where both the university community and the general public can study and learn from directly experiencing works of different art. The university has its own internal recruiting firm, the Executive Search Group and Strategic Resourcing. Since 2013, this department has been housed under the Office of the President.\n\n\nIn 2006, President Casteen announced an ambitious $3Â billion capital campaign to be completed by December 2011.[101] During the Great Recession, President Sullivan missed the 2011 deadline, and extended it indefinitely.[102] The $3Â billion goal would be met a year and a half later, which President Sullivan announced at graduation ceremonies in May 2013.[103]\n\n\nAs of 2013[update], UVA's $1.4Â billion academic budget is paid for primarily by tuition and fees (32%), research grants (23%), endowment and gifts (19%), and sales and services (12%).[104] The university receives 10% of its academic funds through state appropriation from the Commonwealth of Virginia.[104] For the overall (including non-academic) university budget of $2.6Â billion, 45% comes from medical patient revenue.[104] The Commonwealth contributes less than 6%.[104]\n\n\n\n\n\n| UVA colleges and schools\n |\n| --- |\n| **College/school** | **Year founded** |\n| \n\n---\n\n |\n| School of Architecture | 1954\n |\n| College of Arts & Sciences | 1824\n |\n| Darden School of Business | 1954\n |\n| McIntire School of Commerce | 1921\n |\n| School of Continuing and Professional Studies | 1915\n |\n| School of Data Science | 2019\n |\n| School of Education and Human Development | 1905\n |\n| School of Engineering and Applied Science | 1836\n |\n| School of Law | 1819\n |\n| Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy | 2007\n |\n| School of Medicine | 1819\n |\n| School of Nursing | 1901\n |\n\n\nAlthough UVA is the flagship university of Virginia, state funding has decreased for several consecutive decades.[49] Financial support from the state dropped by half from 12 percent of total revenue in 2001â02 to six percent in 2013â14.[49] The portion of academic revenue coming from the state fell by even more in the same period, from 22 percent to just nine percent.[49] This nominal support from the state, contributing just $154Â million of UVA's $2.6Â billion budget in 2012â13, has led President Sullivan and others to contemplate the partial privatization of the University of Virginia.[105] UVA's Darden School and Law School are already self-sufficient.\n\n\nHunter R. Rawlings III, President of the prominent Association of American Universities research group of universities, came to Charlottesville to make a speech to university faculty which included a statement about the proposal: \"there's no possibility, as far as I can see, that any state will ever relinquish its ownership and governance of its public universities, much less of its flagship research university\".[105] He encouraged university leaders to stop talking about privatization and instead push their state lawmakers to increase funding for higher education and research as a public good.[105]\n\n\nAs of 2013, the University of Virginia was one of only two public universities in the United States that had a Triple-A credit rating from all three major credit rating agencies.[106]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Virginia offers 48 bachelor's degrees, 94 master's degrees, 55 doctoral degrees, 6 educational specialist degrees, and 2 first-professional degrees (Medicine and Law) to its students. All degrees are earned and UVA has never bestowed an honorary degree to any person.[107][108][109]\n\n\n\n### Scholarships[edit]\n\n\nThe Jefferson Scholarship is the most competitive merit scholarship nationwide. Around 30 scholars are selected annually from a direct application pool of 4,500 nominating schools, each able to nominate only one student. Covering all tuition, books, room and board, the scholarship also provides scholars finances for summer enrichment, independent research and study abroad.\n\n\nEchols Scholars (College of Arts and Sciences) and Rodman Scholars (School of Engineering and Applied Science), which include 6â7% of undergraduate students, receive no financial benefits, but are entitled to special advisors, priority course registration, residence in designated dorms and fewer curricular constraints than other students have.[110]\n\n\n\n![](image)Alderman Library is home to 1.7Â million books.[111] It is one of eleven libraries at UVA, and hosts one-third of the 1.9 million visitors to the system each year as of 2018.[112]\nFull tuition scholarships are given to each in-state student from families earning under $80,000 dollars per year.[72] Each in-state student from families earning under $30,000 dollars per year also receives free room and board.[72] These scholarships are initiatives of President Ryan, who announced them upon his inauguration in 2018.[72]\n\n\n\n### Research[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Virginia is the first and longest serving public member of the Association of American Universities in the American South, attaining membership in 1904.[113] It is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities â Very high research activity\".[114]\n\n\nAccording to the National Science Foundation, UVA spent $614Â million on research and development in 2019, ranking it 44th in the nation and first in Virginia.[115] Built in 1996, North Fork (formerly the UVA Research Park[116] is an extensive 3.7-million square foot, 562 acre research park nine miles north of UVA's North Grounds.[117][118] It houses the UVA Applied Research Institute as well as many private R&D efforts by such firms as Battelle, The MITRE Corporation, Signature Science, and CACI.[118][119]\n\n\nUVA is also home to globally recognized research on hypersonic flight for NASA and other organizations.[120] The United States Air Force, National Science Foundation, and National Center for Hypersonic Combined Cycle Propulsion have each also granted UVA researchers millions in funding for the university's ongoing broad and deep research into ultra-high velocity flight.[120] Starting in 2015, a UVA team led by mechanical engineering professor Eric Loth began Department of Energy-funded research into an original design of offshore wind turbines that would potentially dwarf the size and scope of any being produced or researched anywhere else.[121] The innovative design inspired by palm trees led to Loth being named to a *Popular Science* list of \"The Brilliant Minds Behind The New Energy Revolution\".[121][122][123]\n\n\n\n![](image)2015 UVA research \"redrew the map\" of the human lymphatic system, shown here in the 1858 *Gray's Anatomy*.\nUVA was recognized by *Science* as leading two of the top 10 scientific discoveries in the world in 2015.[11] The first breakthrough was when UVA School of Medicine researchers Jonathan Kipnis and Antoine Louveau discovered previously unknown vessels connecting the human brain directly to the lymphatic system.[11] The discovery \"redrew the map\" of the lymphatic system, rewrote medical textbooks, and struck down long-held beliefs about how the immune system functions in the brain.[11] The discovery may help greatly in combating neurological diseases from multiple sclerosis to Alzheimer's disease.[11] The second globally recognized breakthrough of 2015 was when UVA psychology professor Brian Nosek examined the reproducibility of 100 psychology studies and found fewer than half could be reproduced.[11] The discovery may have profound impacts on how psychological studies are performed and documented.[11] More than 270 researchers on five continents were involved, and twenty-two students and faculty from UVA were listed as co-authors on the scientific paper.[11]\n\n\nIn the field of astrophysics, the university is a member of a consortium engaged in the construction and operation of the Large Binocular Telescope in the Mount Graham International Observatory of the Pinaleno Mountains of southeastern Arizona. It is also a member of both the Astrophysical Research Consortium, which operates telescopes at Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico, and the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy which operates the National Optical Astronomy Observatory, the Gemini Observatory and the Space Telescope Science Institute. The University of Virginia hosts the headquarters of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, which operates the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia and the Very Large Array radio telescope made famous in the Carl Sagan television documentary *Cosmos* and film *Contact*. The North American Atacama Large Millimeter Array Science Center is also at the Charlottesville NRAO site. In 2019, researchers at NRAO co-authored a study documenting the discovery of a pair of giant hourglass shaped balloons emanating radio waves from the center of our Milky Way galaxy.[124]\n\n\n\n### Innovation[edit]\n\n\nThe Charlottesville area has been named the No. 1 fastest growing metropolitan area for venture capital in the United States, with $27.7Â million in annual funding as of 2015[update].[125] A majority of the successful startups in the Charlottesville region have been started by or funded by both UVA students and graduates.[125] One example of a startup launched by university students is Reddit, the seventh most-viewed website in the U.S. with hundreds of billions of annual pageviews as of JulyÂ 2021[update],[126] founded by UVA roommates Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian in 2005. They were students at the School of Engineering and Applied Science and the McIntire School of Commerce, respectively. Having grown so large, Reddit is now headquartered in San Francisco. Another example is CNET, which has become the highest-read technology news source on the Web, with over 200Â million readers per month, being among the 200 most visited websites globally as of 2015.[127][128][129]\n\n\nIn addition to McIntire and SEAS, the Darden School has spawned highly innovative graduates and entrepreneurs. For example, a wearable glove that helps to rehabilitate stroke patients was brought to market by a Darden graduate in South Korea during 2015.[130] According to a study by researchers at the Darden School and Stanford University, UVA alumni overall have founded over 65,000 companies which have employed 2.3Â million people worldwide with annual global revenues of $1.6Â trillion.[131]\n\n\n\n### Rankings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Academic rankings |\n| --- |\n| National |\n| *Forbes*[132] | 29 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[133] | 24 |\n| *Washington Monthly*[134] | 28 |\n| Global |\n| *ARWU*[135] | 201â300 |\n| *QS*[136] | 260 |\n| *THE*[137] | 156= |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[138] | 119 |\n\n\n*U.S. News & World Report* ranks UVA 24th among national universities overall,[139] 8th best business program[140] and 3rd best business management program in the country.[141]\n\n\nAmong the professional schools of UVA, *U.S. News & World Report'*s 2021 rankings place its law school 8th best overall and 1st among public universities, its graduate Darden School of Business 11th overall and 2nd among public universities, the medical school 6th overall in the \"Primary Care\" category and tied for 29th overall in the \"Research\" category, and the engineering school tied for 41st overall.[142] In its 2015 rankings, *The Economist* lists Darden 2nd overall globally and 1st among public institutions.[143] In its 2016 listing, *Bloomberg BusinessWeek* ranked the McIntire School of Commerce, UVA's undergraduate business program, 5th overall and 2nd among public universities.[144]\n\n\n*Washington Monthly* ranked UVA 28th in its 2020 ranking of national universities based on its contribution to the public good, as measured by social mobility, research, and promoting good public service.[145] In its 2016 report, *Business Insider*, which strives to measure preparation for the professional workforce, ranked UVA ninth overall and first among public universities.[146]\n\n\n\n### Other recognition[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Virginia has also been recognized for consistently having the highest African American graduation rate among national public universities.[147][148][149] According to the Fall 2005 issue of *Journal of Blacks in Higher Education*, UVA \"has the highest black student graduation rate of the Public Ivies\" and \"by far the most impressive is the University of Virginia with its high black student graduation rate and its small racial difference in graduation rates.\"[150]\n\n\n\n### Undergraduate admissions and financial aid[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Undergraduate admissions statistics |\n| --- |\n| 2023 enteringclass[151]Change vs.2018[152]\n\n\n---\n\n |\n| Admit rate | 16.2% (![Neutral decrease](image)Â â11.1)\n |\n| Yield rate | 39.1% (![Increase](image)Â +1)\n |\n| Test scores middle 50% |\n| SAT Total | 1400-1510(among 51% of FTFs) |\n| ACT Composite | 32-35(among 21% of FTFs) |\n|  |\n\n\nFor the undergraduate Class of 2023, the University of Virginia received a record 40,815 applications, admitting 24 percent.[153][154] Approximately 40 percent of those admitted are non-white.[153] Matriculated students come from all 50 states and 147 foreign countries.[155][156] UVA is required, by Virginia state law, to matriculate two-thirds of its undergraduate student body from its pool of in-state applicants.[153] As a result, its acceptance rate for in-state students (36 percent) is nearly twice the out-of-state rate (19 percent) as of 2019.[153] The university has seen steady increases to its applicant pool in recent decades, and the number of applications has more than doubled since the Class of 2008 received 15,094 applications.[157] As of 2014, 93 percent of admitted applicants ranked in the top 10 percent of their high school classes.[156][158]\n\n\nAdmission is need-blind for domestic applicants.[159] President James Ryan announced at his inauguration in fall 2018 that in-state students from families earning less than $80,000 a year will receive full tuition scholarships.[72] Those from families earning less than $30,000 will also receive free room and board.[72] The university already met 100 percent of demonstrated need for all admitted undergraduate students, making it one of only two public universities in the U.S. to reach this level of financial aid for its students.[160][161] For 2014, the university ranked fourth overall by the *Princeton Review* for \"Great Financial Aid\".[162] In 2008 the Center for College Affordability and Productivity named UVA the top value among all national public colleges and universities; and in 2009, UVA was again named the \"No. 1 Best Value\" among public universities in the United States in a separate ranking by *USA TODAY* and the *Princeton Review.*[163][164][165] *Kiplinger* in 2014 ranked UVA second out of the top 100 best-value public colleges and universities in the nation.[166]\n\n\nGraduate and professional school admissions are also highly selective. As of 2019, the average LSAT score was 169 at the School of Law, while at the Darden School of Business the average GMAT score was 718.[167][168]\n\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\n\n\nStudent body composition as of May 2, 2022\n| Race and ethnicity[169] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| White | 56%\n | 56 |\n| Asian | 16%\n | 16 |\n| Other[g] | 10%\n | 10 |\n| Black | 7%\n | 7 |\n| Hispanic | 7%\n | 7 |\n| Foreign national | 4%\n | 4 |\n| Economic diversity |\n| Low-income[h] | 13%\n | 13 |\n| Affluent[i] | 87%\n | 87 |\n\n\nStudent life at the University of Virginia is marked by a number of unique traditions. The campus of the university is referred to as the \"Grounds\". Freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors are instead called first-, second-, third-, and fourth-years to reflect Jefferson's belief that learning is a lifelong process, rather than one to be completed within four years.\n\n\n\n![](image)William Faulkner once lived among the students of UVA after winning the Nobel Prize for Literature, and bequeathed most of his papers to Alderman Library.\n### Student-faculty interaction and connections[edit]\n\n\nProfessors are traditionally addressed as \"Mr.\" or \"Ms.\" at UVA instead of \"Doctor\" (although medical doctors are the one exception) in deference to Jefferson's desire to have an equality of ideas, discriminated by merit and unburdened by title. UVA facilitates close interactions between students and professors in a number of ways.\n\n\nFirst-year students in the College of Arts & Sciences have the opportunity to take two University Seminars, one per semester, which are later made available to other years students as well. These small classes, typically numbering from 4 to 19 students each, provide opportunities to work closely with professors at the university from the outset of a student's academic career. The small groupings also help facilitate more frequent and intense discussions between students in this closer environment.\n\n\nSelect faculty live at Brown College at Monroe Hill, Hereford College, International Residential College, and in Pavilions on the Lawn. This living arrangement gives more opportunities for professors to invite students to lunches and dinners, which regularly happens, and creates chances for impromptu meetings and interactions between faculty and students around Grounds.\n\n\nReflecting this close student-faculty interaction at UVA, it welcomed Nobel Laureate William Faulkner to a position as \"Writer-in-Residence\" in 1957.[170] He had no teaching responsibilities, and was paid merely to live among the students and write. He was badly injured in a horse riding accident in 1959, and did not return to the state before his death in 1962.[170] Faulkner then bequeathed the majority of his papers to Alderman Library, giving UVA the largest Faulkner archives in the world.[171]\n\n\n\n### Global citizenship initiatives[edit]\n\n\nThe International Residential College is a residential college at UVA that attracts and celebrates students from across the globe who choose to attend the university. It is one of the three major residential colleges at UVA. Students there come from 45 countries, representing 40% of the student population; but U.S. students are encouraged to live at the IRC as well to learn about the countries from which their classmates have journeyed to attend UVA.\n\n\nUVA was previously the academic sponsor for Semester at Sea, a multi-country study abroad program conducted on a cruise ship.\n\n\nThe University of Virginia received the 2015 Paul Simon Award for Comprehensive Internationalization, by the Association of International Educators.[172] This award confirms the university's success and commitment in educating its students on a global scale as well as nationally.[172]\n\n\n\n### Student leadership opportunities[edit]\n\n\nThere are a number of UVA undergraduate leadership opportunities that are offered in addition to the standard student government or fraternity and sorority positions found at many other universities. They include UVA's secret societies and debating societies, the student-run honor committees, and the chance to be recognized as a fourth-year student at the pinnacle of student leadership by being asked to live on the Lawn.\n\n\nThe Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy, established in 2007, expands on these unique student leadership opportunities to study Leadership itself as a cross-disciplinary subject of focus and is closely aligned with many of the university's schools, including the Architecture, Education, Engineering, Law, Medical, and Darden schools, as well as with programs in politics, economics, and applied ethics.\n\n\nThe University of Virginia has a long history of student activists who formed radical environmental, religious, and political groups to champion various social changes.[173] An especially intense period of student activism occurred in the 1970s during the May Days strikes against the Vietnam War.[174] More recently, the School of Education and Human Development and its Youth-Nex Center held a national conference in 2019 to promote student activism at UVA and beyond.[175]\n\n\n\n### Secret societies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Secret Societies at the University of Virginia\n\n![](image)The mark of one out of many secret societies active on Grounds at the university\nStudent societies have existed on Grounds since the early twentieth century. Secret societies have been a part of University of Virginia student life since the first class of students in 1825. While the number of societies peaked during the 75-year period between 1875 and 1950, there are still six societies active that are over 100 years old, and several newer secret societies.\n\n\n\n### Honor system[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Honor system at the University of Virginia\n\nHonor Pledge[176]\n\n\n> \n> On my honor, I have neither given nor received aid on this assignment.\n> \n> \n> \n>\n\nThe nation's first codified honor system was instituted by UVA law professor Henry St. George Tucker, Sr. in 1842, after a fellow professor was shot to death on the Lawn. There are three tenets to the system: students simply must not lie, cheat, or steal. For its first 180 years it was a \"single sanction system,\" meaning that committing any of these three offenses would result in immediate expulsion from the university. In the spring of 2022, following decades of criticism and waning support, a proposal to replace the penalty of expulsion with a two-semester suspension passed a student referendum with over 80% of the vote and took effect immediately.\n\n\nThe honor system is intended to be student-run and student-administered.[177] If accused, students are tried before their peersâfellow students, never faculty, serve as counsel and jury. Although Honor Committee resources have been strained by mass cheating scandals such as a case in 2001 of 122 suspected cheaters over several years in a single large Physics survey course, and federal lawsuits have challenged the system, its verdicts are rarely overturned.[178][179][180] There is only one documented case of direct UVA administration interference in an honor system proceeding: the trial and subsequent retrial of student Christopher Leggett.[181]\n\n\n\n### Student activities[edit]\n\n\nMany events take place at the University of Virginia, on the Lawn and across Grounds. One of the largest events at UVA is Springfest, hosted by the University Programs Council. It takes place every year in the spring, and features a large free concert, various inflatables, games. Another popular event and tradition is Lighting of the Lawn in the winter. Established in 2001 as a tribute to the September 11 Attacks, Lighting of the Lawn consists of a light and music show on the Lawn. Another popular event is Foxfield, a steeplechase and social gathering that takes place nearby in Albemarle County in April, and which is annually attended by thousands of students from the University of Virginia, neighboring colleges, and local residents.[182]\n\n\n\n![](image)The University Amphitheater is often used for outdoor lectures and student gatherings.\nThe student life building is called Newcomb Hall. It is home to the Student Activities Center (SAC) and the Media Activities Center (MAC), where student groups can get leadership consulting and use computing and copying resources, as well as several meeting rooms for student groups. Student Council, the student self-governing body, holds meetings Tuesdays at 6:30Â p.m. in the Newcomb South Meeting Room. Student Council, or \"StudCo\", also holds office hours and regular committee meetings in the newly renovated Newcomb Programs and Council (PAC) Room. The PAC also houses the University Programs Council and Class Councils. Newcomb basement is home to both the office of the independent student newspaper *The Declaration*, *The Cavalier Daily*, and the Consortium of University Publications.\n\n\nIn 2005, the university was named \"Hottest for Fitness\" by *Newsweek* magazine,[183] due in part to 94% of its students using one of the four indoor athletics facilities. Particularly popular is the Aquatics and Fitness Center, across the street from the Alderman Dorms. The University of Virginia sent more workers to the Peace Corps in 2006[184] and 2008[185] than any other \"medium-sized\" university in the United States. Volunteerism at the university is centered around Madison House which offers numerous opportunities to serve others. Among the numerous programs offered are tutoring, housing improvement, an organization called Hoos Against Hunger, which gives leftover food from restaurants to the homeless of Charlottesville rather than allowing it to be discarded, among numerous other volunteer programs.\n\n\nAs at many universities, alcohol use is a part of the social life of many undergraduate students. Concerns particularly arose about a past trend of fourth-years consuming excessive alcohol during the day of the last home football game.[186] President Casteen announced a $2.5Â million donation from Anheuser-Busch to fund a new UVA-based Social Norms Institute in September 2006.[187] A spokesman said: \"the goal is to get students to emulate the positive behavior of the vast majority of students\". On the other hand, the university was ranked first in *Playboy*'s 2012 list of Top 10 Party Schools based on ratings of sex, sports, and nightlife.[188]\n\n\n\n### Fraternities and sororities[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Fraternities and sororities at University of Virginia\n\nThe University of Virginia has a number of fraternities and sororities on campus, encompassing the traditional social fraternities and sororities as well as coeducational professional, service, and honor fraternities. Social life at the university was originally dominated by debating societies.[189] The first fraternity chapter founded at UVA was Delta Kappa Epsilon in 1852, and it was quickly followed by many more; the University of Virginia was the birthplace of two national fraternities, Kappa Sigma and Pi Kappa Alpha, which exist at the university as of 2023.[190][191][192]\n\n\nThrough the twentieth century, the roles of these organizations on campus expanded to encompass social sororities, professional fraternities and sororities, service fraternities, honor societies, black fraternities and sororities, and multicultural fraternities and sororities. Roughly 30% of the student body are members of social fraternities and sororities, while additional students are involved with service, professional, and honor fraternities.[193] \"Rush and pledging\" occur in the spring semester for most Greek organizations. Kappa Sigma and the Trigon Engineering Society hold reserved rooms on the Lawn, while Pi Kappa Alpha holds the only undergraduate room on the Range.[194]\n\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Northline Express (NLX) bus of the University Transit Service, with signage celebrating victory at the 2019 NCAA tournament championship (\"March Madness\")\nA set of bus lines operated by the university's University Transit Service connect different parts of the UVA Grounds with adjacent parking facilities. This is complemented by a set of bus lines operated by Charlottesville Area Transit that connect the University of Virginia with other parts of Charlottesville. The Virginia Department of Transportation maintains the roads through the university grounds as State Route 302.[195]\n\n\nCharlottesville Union Station is just 0.6 miles (0.97Â km) from UVA, and from there energy efficient Amtrak passenger trains serve Charlottesville on three routes: the *Cardinal* (Chicago to New York City), *Crescent* (New Orleans to New York City), and *Northeast Regional* (Virginia to Boston). The long-haul *Cardinal* operates three times a week, while the *Crescent* and *Northeast Regional* both run daily. CharlottesvilleâAlbemarle Airport, 8 miles (13Â km) away, has nonstop flights to Chicago, New York, Atlanta, Charlotte, and Philadelphia. The larger Richmond International Airport is 77 miles (124Â km) to the southeast, and the still larger Dulles International Airport is 99 miles (159Â km) to the northeast. They are accessible via Interstate 64 and U.S. 29, respectively, both of which are major highways and frequently trafficked.\n\n\nMegabus began serving Charlottesville with inexpensive direct express routes to and from Washington, D.C. in 2018.[196] Megabus also runs up to four trips per day from Charlottesville to New York City with several stops between.[197] Like the trains, the Megabus stop is at the nearby Amtrak station.[197]\n\n\n\n## Athletics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Virginia Cavaliers\n\nVirginia has ranked near the top of collegiate athletics programs in recent years. In 2015 and 2019, UVA won the nationwide Capital One Cup for overall men's sports excellence.[16] The teams and athletes representing Virginia in college athletics have been dubbed the *Cavaliers* since 1923, predating the NBA's Cleveland Cavaliers by nearly half a century.\n\n\nIn 2019, Virginia men's basketball won the NCAA Championship in \"March Madness\", the single-elimination national college basketball tournament considered by *YouGov* polled American viewers (as of the same year) to be the most exciting collegiate sporting event.[198][199] In 2015, when Virginia first won its first Capital One Cup its teams won the 2014 College Cup, the 2015 College World Series, and the 2015 NCAA Tennis Championships. When it repeated the feat in 2019, the program won both the March Madness tournament and the 2019 Men's Lacrosse Championship.\n\n\nVirginia's athletics director is Carla Williams, the first African American woman to hold the position at any power conference university. The previous athletics director was Craig Littlepage, the first African American to have that title in the ACC. He held the position for sixteen years and, under his leadership, UVA added many significant hires who have demonstrated success near the top of their respective sports, including recent NCAA Champions Tony Bennett, Lars Tiffany, Brian O'Connor, and Todd DeSorbo, as well as former football coach Bronco Mendenhall. Among coaches who have longer tenures, George Gelnovatch has won two NCAA men's soccer national titles since 2009. Steve Swanson has led women's soccer teams to six ACC titles and 24 consecutive winning seasons. Kevin Sauer has led UVA women's rowing to two NCAA titles since 2010.\n\n\n\n![](image)UVA lacrosse has won 11 national championships, including nine national titles since NCAA oversight began.\n### Championships[edit]\n\n\nIn the 21st century alone, UVA teams have won seventeen NCAA championships. The men's teams have won NCAA titles in basketball (2019); lacrosse (2003, 2006, 2011, 2019, and 2021); baseball (2015); soccer (2009 and 2014); and tennis (2013, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2022 and 2023). UVA women have won recent NCAA titles in rowing (2010 and 2012) and swimming & diving (2021, 2022 and 2023). The Cavaliers rank first in the ACC (a power conference) with 23 men's NCAA Championships, and rank second in the conference with ten women's NCAA Championships.\n\n\nUnder Tony Bennett the Cavaliers have experienced a basketball renaissance, winning the 2019 NCAA Championship, winning the ACC tournaments of 2014 (over Duke) and 2018 (over North Carolina), and winning regular-season championships in 2014, 2015, 2018, and 2019. UVA became the third program in ACC history to win 30 or more games in consecutive seasons and John Paul Jones Arena is considered one of the more intimidating trips for opposing teams to make. The women's basketball program fell just short of its own NCAA Championship in 1990, losing the Championship Game in overtime.\n\n\nThe Virginia men's and women's lacrosse programs are two of the most dominant in the history of the sport, winning ten of UVA's twenty-nine NCAA Championships between them and two more (for a total of 11 recognized national championships) before NCAA oversight began. 2019 and 2021 NCAA champion men's head coach Lars Tiffany has brought UVA back to prominence after Dom Starsia retired as the all-time ACC leader in men's lacrosse wins. All three UVA head coaches in the position prior to Tiffany still rank (as of 2019) in the top 20 of career wins. Three-time NCAA champion head coach Julie Myers leads women's lacrosse and under her guidance, Virginia is the only program to qualify for 24 straight NCAA tournament berths as of 2019.[200]\n\n\nThe Cavalier baseball team under Brian O'Connor has also experienced tremendous success. UVA finished as national runners-up in the 2014 College World Series and came back to win the 2015 College World Series. Virginia has hosted five NCAA Super Regional tournament events at Davenport Field.\n\n\nThe UVA men's tennis program won \"three-peat\" NCAA Championships in 2015â2017 after winning the Cavaliers' first in 2013. The team won back-to-back championships in 2022 and 2023. The program has regularly featured international talent combined with locally grown high school tennis talent from Virginia (often Northern Virginia).[201]\n\n\nThe University of Virginia women's cross country team won the 1981 and 1982 NCAA Women's Division I Cross Country Championship as well as the DI Indoor Championships.[202]\n\n\nThe women's swimming and diving team won its first NCAA Championship in 2021.[203] The women repeated the feat in both 2022[204] and 2023.[205]\n\n\n\n### Rivalries[edit]\n\n\nOfficial ACC designated rivalry games include the VirginiaâVirginia Tech rivalry and the VirginiaâLouisville series. These two rivalries are guaranteed an annual game in all sports, and a home-and-away series in men's and women's basketball. The Cavaliers competed against the Hokies in the *Commonwealth Challenge* and more recently competed in the *Commonwealth Clash*, under new rules, for many sports in which they compete head-to-head. The Cavaliers went 2â0 against the Hokies in the *Challenge* and 3â2 in the *Clash* (5â2 overall). Perhaps the two most significant rivalry games played between the Cavaliers and Hokies were both in men's basketball, on March 1, 2007, and January 15, 2019. In the former, the two teams met with identical 10â4 ACC records and the winner would clinch a share of the regular-season conference championship. UVA won the game 69â56 and took their fifth of ten ACC titles. In the latter, No. 4 UVA beat No. 9 Virginia Tech 81â59 in the only meeting between two AP Top 10 teams in the rivalry's history.\n\n\n\n![](image)Tony Bennett has a winning record against each of UVA's rivals.\nThe ACC is often regarded as the best college basketball conference,[206][207][208][209][210] and UVA leads the series in its official ACC basketball rivalries: against Virginia Tech 96â56, and Louisville 15â4, as of 2019[update]. A budding but lopsided series between Virginia's Tony Bennett and Louisville's Rick Pitino saw Bennett win 5 of 6 games before Pitino's Hall of Fame career ended in scandal at Louisville. Other notable basketball rivalries include those against North Carolina and Maryland. Notably the 1982 ACC tournament championship game where Dean Smith had his team of future NBA stars (such as Michael Jordan and James Worthy) hold the ball for seven minutes, against a Virginia team featuring Ralph Sampson, led to the advent of the shot clock and the three-point line. The Maryland rivalry is now mostly dormant, but was reignited for the 2014 and 2018 editions of the ACCâBig Ten Challenge, with both Challenges won by the Cavaliers on the road in College Park.\n\n\nVirginia men's lacrosse, as one of the all-time great NCAA programs, has a championship rivalry with fellow ACC program Syracuse (the Cavaliers and Orange holding 18 NCAA Championships between them) as well as rivalries against Big Ten programs Johns Hopkins and Maryland. The Syracuse and Johns Hopkins rivalries are played out at least once each season (Syracuse played *twice* in 2021[211]) with the teams often finding themselves facing off a second or third time in the ACC and NCAA tournaments. Virginia women's lacrosse, also a multi-NCAA Championship program, maintains several of those same rivalries.\n\n\nThe Virginia football team competes against North Carolina in the South's Oldest Rivalry, a historic football rivalry game which a sitting President of the United States, Calvin Coolidge, made time to attend in Charlottesville in 1924. The 1960s and 1970s were particularly dark decades for the football program, which later experienced a resurgence in the 1980s and 1990s under George Welsh. Coach Welsh led the program to its first bowl bids starting with the 1984 Peach Bowl. Welsh, who even reached AP No. 1 rankings for Virginia in October 1990, is a member of the College Football Hall of Fame after compiling the second-most wins in ACC history after Bobby Bowden.[212] In a historic rivalry between two legendary coaches, Welsh finished two games up in the head-to-head series against Virginia Tech coach Frank Beamer, 8â6. He was also dominant against UNC in the South's Oldest Rivalry, finishing 13â5â1, including a perfect 10â0 record against North Carolina at Scott Stadium.\n\n\n\n### Sponsorship[edit]\n\n\nIn 2015, The Cavaliers negotiated a 10-year sponsorship deal with Nike, from which the program receives $3.5Â million per year.[213]\n\n\n\n## People[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of University of Virginia people and List of University of Virginia School of Law alumni\n\n### Faculty[edit]\n\n\nMain category: University of Virginia faculty\n\nFaculty were originally housed in the Academical Village among the students, serving as both instructors and advisors, continuing on to include the McCormick Road Old Dorms, though this has been phased out in favor of undergraduate student resident advisors (RAs). Several of the faculty, however, continue the university tradition of living on Grounds, either on the Lawn in the various Pavilions, or as fellows at one of three residential colleges (Brown College at Monroe Hill, Hereford College, and the International Residential College).\n\n\nThe university's faculty includes a National Humanities Medal and National Medal of Arts winner and former United States Poet Laureate, an awardee of the Order of Isabella the Catholic,[214] 25 Guggenheim fellows, 26 Fulbright fellows, six National Endowment for the Humanities fellows, two Presidential Young Investigator Award winners, three Sloan award winners, three Packard Foundation Award winners, and a winner of the 2005 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.[215] Physics professor James McCarthy was the lead academic liaison to the government in the establishment of Suranet, and the university has also participated in ARPANET, Abilene, Internet2, and Lambda Rail. On March 19, 1986, the university's domain name, `VIRGINIA.EDU`, became the first registration under the `.edu` top-level domain originating from the Commonwealth of Virginia on what would become the World Wide Web.[216]\n\n\nLarry Sabato has, according to *The Wall Street Journal* and *The Washington Post*, become the most-cited professor in the country by national and regional news organizations, both on the Internet and in print.[217] Civil rights activist Julian Bond, a professor in the Corcoran Department of History from 1990 to 2012, was the chairman of the NAACP from 1998 to 2009 and was chosen to host the Nobel Laureates conference in 1998.\n\n\n\nFamous current and former UVA faculty and staff in residence\n![](image)\nTerry Belanger  \nFounder of the Rare Book School; MacArthur Genius Grant\n![](image)\nJulian Bond  \nCo-founder of Southern Poverty Law Center; Chairman of the NAACP\n![](image)\nJames Buchanan  \nFounder of Virginia school of political economy; Nobel Prize in Economics\n![](image)\nRita Dove  \nFirst African American United States Poet Laureate; Pulitzer Prize for Poetry\n![](image)\nWilliam Faulkner  \nNobel Prize in Literature and Pulitzer Prize for Fiction\n![](image)\nLarry Sabato  \nFounder of Center for Politics and *Larry Sabato's Crystal Ball*\n![](image)\nAntonin Scalia  \nAssociate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States\n![](image)\nKathryn Thornton  \nU.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame; former recordholder for most spacewalks by a woman\n\n### Alumni[edit]\n\n\nAs of December 2014[update], the University of Virginia has 221,000 living graduates.[131] According to a study by researchers at the Darden School and Stanford University, UVA alumni have founded over 65,000 companies which have employed 2.3Â million people worldwide with annual global revenues of $1.6Â trillion.[131] Extrapolated numbers show companies founded by UVA alumni have created 371,000 jobs in the state of Virginia alone.[131] The relatively small amount that the Commonwealth gives UVA for support was determined by the study to have a tremendous return on investment for the state.[131]\n\n\nRhodes Scholarships are international postgraduate awards given to students to study at the University of Oxford. Since the scholarship program began in 1904, UVA has had fifty-five Rhodes Scholars,[218] the most of any university in the American South, eighth-most overall, and third-most outside the Ivy League (behind Stanford University and the United States Military Academy (West Point)).[219]\n\n\nEight NASA astronauts and launch directors are UVA alumni: Karl Gordon Henize, Bill Nelson, Thomas Marshburn, Leland Melvin, Jeff Wisoff, Kathryn Thornton, Patrick Forrester; and Michael Leinbach.\n\n\nThe Pulitzer Prize has been awarded to eight UVA alumni: Edward P. Jones, Ron Suskind, Virginius Dabney, Claudia Emerson, Henry Taylor, Lane DeGregory, George Rodrigue, and Michael Vitez.\n\n\nGovernment leaders include 28th President of the United States Woodrow Wilson (who attended before transferring), former Special Counsel and FBI Director Robert Mueller; NATO Secretary General Javier Solana; U.S. Speaker of the House Robert M. T. Hunter; widely known United States Senators Harry Byrd, Robert F. Kennedy, and Ted Kennedy; first African American Chief Justice of the Virginia Supreme Court Leroy Hassell; Delaware Court of Chancery Vice Chancellor J. Travis Laster; United States Supreme Court Justices Howell Edmunds Jackson, James Clark McReynolds, and Stanley Forman Reed; President of the Supreme Court of Israel, Asher Grunis; and Premier and President of the First Republic of China, Yan Huiqing.\n\n\nThirty U.S. state or U.S. territorial Governors have graduated from UVA, including fifteen Governors of Virginia,[j] and fifteen Governors of other U.S. states and territories as well.[k]\n\n\nUVA's alumni ranks also include others who have achieved widespread fame: computer science pioneer John Backus; polar explorer Richard Byrd; scientists Walter Reed, Stuart Schreiber, Daniel Barringer, Richard Lutz, and Francis Collins; artists Edgar Allan Poe and Georgia O'Keeffe; musicians Stephen Malkmus and Boyd Tinsley; self-made billionaire Paul Tudor Jones; national news anchors Katie Couric and Brit Hume; actors Tina Fey and Ben McKenzie; Team USA Olympic team captains John Harkes, Dawn Staley, and Claudio Reyna; NBA All-Star MVP Ralph Sampson and the NBA's eighth ever 50â40â90 shooter Malcolm Brogdon; two-time FIFA Women's World Cup champions Becky Sauerbrunn, Emily Sonnett and Morgan Brian; and voice actor Sam Riegel.\n\n\n\nFamous UVA alumni\n![](image)\nMalcolm Brogdon  \n(B.A./M.P.P., '15/'16)  \n8th 50â40â90 club member; 2017 NBA Rookie of the Year\n![](image)\nFrancis Collins  \n(B.S., '70)  \nDirector of the National Institutes of Health; project leader of Human Genome Project\n![](image)\nKatie Couric  \n(B.A., '79)  \nTelevision Hall of Fame; News anchor for each of the Big Three television networks\n![](image)\nTina Fey  \n(B.A., '92)  \n*Saturday Night Live* actor and head writer; creator of *30 Rock*\n![](image)\nYan Huiqing  \n(B.A., 1900)  \n1st Chinese ambassador to the Soviet Union; Premier and acting President of China\n![](image)\nRobert F.

It includes nine universities and five independent health institutions. The UTÂ System is headquartered in Downtown Austin. Its total enrollment of nearly 240,000 students is the largest university system in Texas. It employs 21,000 faculty and more than 83,000 health care professionals, researchers and support staff. The UT System's $30 billion endowment (as of the 2019 fiscal year) is the largest of any public university system in the United States.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Component institutions[edit]\n\n\n![University of Texas System is located in Texas](image)![UT Arlington](image)\nUT Arlington\n![UT Austin](image)\nUT Austin\n![UT Dallas](image)\nUT Dallas\n![UT El Paso](image)\nUT El Paso\n![UT Rio Grande Valley](image)\nUT Rio Grande Valley\n![UT San Antonio](image)\nUT San Antonio\n![UT Tyler](image)\nUT Tyler\n![UT Permian Basin](image)\nUT Permian Basin\n![UT Southwestern](image)\nUT Southwestern\n![UTMB - Galveston](image)\nUTMB - Galveston\n![UT HSC - Houston](image)\nUT HSC - Houston\n![UT HSC - San Antonio](image)\nUT HSC - San Antonio\n![UT MD Anderson](image)\nUT MD Anderson\n![SFA](image)\nSFA\nInstitutions\nUniversity of Texas System (Texas)\n\n### Academic institutions[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Texas System has nine universities that each confers its own degrees. \n\n\n\n\n\n| Official name\n | Officialabbreviations\n | Location\n | Estab.\n | Joinedsystem\n | Enrollment(Fall 2017 except as noted) | Nickname\n | Athleticconference\n | Refs\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Stephen F.

Austin State University[edit]\n\n\nOn November 29, 2022, the Board of Regents of Stephen F. Austin State University (SFA) announced their decision to accept an invitation to join the UT System. This decision occurred following an announcement at the start of the fall semester by SFA President Steve Westbrook that the board was considering joining a system. At the time, Stephen F. Austin was one of two independent public universities in Texas, alongside Texas Southern University. The Texas A&M University System, the Texas Tech University System, and the Texas State University System all extended invitations as well. The decision to join the UT System was made following a process that included faculty, staff, student, and alumni input.[5] Stephen F. Austin's addition to the UT System was approved by the Texas Legislature during the 2023 session. The identically worded House and Senate bills that would formally add SFA to the UT System specified that SFA would retain its name, but with the phrase \"a member of The University of Texas System\" appended to the legal school name. They also stated that SFA would be technically dissolved and then immediately reconstituted as a member of the UT System.[36] The Senate unanimously passed its bill on April 16, 2023,[37] and the House passed its version on April 26.[38] Governor Greg Abbott signed the measure into law on May 10.[39]\n\n\n\n#### UT Brownsville and UT Pan American (UTRGV) merger[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University of Texas Rio Grande Valley\n\nOn June 14, 2013, Texas Governor Rick Perry signed a law officially approving the creation of a new university in South Texas within the UT System and replacing UT Brownsville and UT Pan American. The initiative resulted in a single institution, including a medical school, spanning the entire Rio Grande Valley, with a presence in each of the major metropolitan areas of Brownsville, Edinburg, Harlingen, and McAllen. On December 12, 2013, the UT Board of Regents voted to name the new university the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley.[40] The new university began full operation in the 2015â16 school year.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Official name\n | Officialabbreviations\n | Location\n | Founded\n | Joinedsystem\n | Merged\n | Refs\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| The University of Texas at Brownsville | UTB\nUT Brownsville\n | Brownsville | 1973\n | 1991\n | 2015(merged to form The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley) | [41][42] |\n| The University of TexasâPan American | UTPA\nUT Pan American\n | Edinburg | 1927\n | 1989\n | [43][44] |\n\n\n#### UT Tyler and UTHSC Tyler merger[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University of Texas at Tyler\n\nIn December 2019, the UT System Board of Regents unanimously agreed to merge The University of Texas Health Science Center at Tyler (UTHSCT) under The University of Texas at Tyler (UTT), creating a single unified institution.[45] Two months later, the UT System formally announced its intention to establish a new medical school that will be added under the new unified UT Tyler administration.[46] It will be the first medical school in the East Texas region.\n\n\nOn December 8, 2020, The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Schools approved a plan to merge UT Tyler and UTHSCT. UTHSCT will retain its status as a health-related institution but will now come under the administration of UT Tyler. The UT System Board of Regents met in late December 2020 and took action on the implementation of the merger which began on January 1, 2021.[47]\n\n\nOn January 4, 2021, the Board of Regents installed Kirk A. Calhoun, M.D. as president of the newly aligned UT Tyler and UTHSCT. As of January 4, these two institutions are officially one. On January 15, 2021 the institution publicly named the new line of executive leadership for the merged institution.[48]\n\n\nThe medical school is expected to open in 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Official name\n | Officialabbreviations\n | Location\n | Founded\n | Joinedsystem\n | Merged\n | Refs\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| The University of Texas at Tyler | UTT\nUT Tyler\n | Tyler | 1971\n | 1979\n | 2021(merged as The University of Texas at Tyler) | [49][32] |\n| The University of Texas Health Science Center at Tyler | UTHSCT\nUT Health Tyler\n | Tyler | 1943\n | 1977\n | [50][51] |\n\n\n### Health institutions[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Texas System has 5 independent health institutions. None are officially associated with any of the 4-year academic institutions, though some may have close relationships or special joint programs with them due to geographical location (DallasâFort Worth area institutions & San Antonio institutions) or historical relationships (UT Austin & UT Medical Branch at Galveston).\n\n\nUT MD Anderson Cancer Center is one of the six schools at UT Health Science Center at Houston. Despite being officially associated under UT Houston, the UT System lists MD Anderson as a separate health institution due to its unique specialization.\n\n\nAdditionally, there are medical schools at UT Austin and UT Rio Grande Valley that are not directly affiliated with any of the independent health institutions.[52] The third medical school organized under an academic institution in the UT System will open in 2023 under the UT Tyler administration.\n\n\n\n#### Independent UT Health institutions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Official name\n | Officialabbreviations\n | Medical school\n | Location\n | Estab.\n | Refs\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio | UTHSA or\nUTHSCSA\nUT Health San Antonio\n | Long School of Medicine | San Antonio (main), Laredo | 1959\n | [53][54] |\n| The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston | UTH\nUTHealth or\nUT Houston\n | McGovern Medical School | Houston | 1972\n | [55] |\n| The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center | UTMDACC\nMD Anderson\n | N/A (associated with UTH)\n | Houston (main), Katy, League City,\nMemorial City, Sugar Land, The Woodlands\n | 1941\n | [56] |\n| The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston | UTMB\nUT Galveston\n | John Sealy School of Medicine\n | Galveston | 1891\n | [57] |\n| The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center | UTSW\nUT Southwestern\n | UTSW Medical School\n | Dallas (main), Fort Worth,\nFrisco, Irving, Richardson\n | 1943\n | [58][59] |\n\n\n#### Medical schools within academic institutions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Medical school\n | Academic institution affiliation\n | Location\n | Estab.\n | Refs\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Dell Medical School | UT Austin | Austin | 2013\n | [60] |\n| UTRGV School of Medicine | UT Rio Grande Valley | Harlingen (main), Brownsville, Edinburg | 2013\n | [61] |\n| UT Tyler School of Medicine\\*\n(\\**In Development, Projected Opening 2023*)\n | UT Tyler | Tyler | 2023\n | [62] |\n\n  \n\n\n* ![UT Health Science Center - Houston](image)\n\nUT Health Science Center - Houston\n* ![UT Health Science Center - San Antonio](image)\n\nUT Health Science Center - San Antonio\n* ![UT MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX)](image)\n\nUT MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX)\n* ![UT Medical Branch at Galveston](image)\n\nUT Medical Branch at Galveston\n* ![UT Southwestern Medical Center (Dallas, TX)](image)\n\nUT Southwestern Medical Center (Dallas, TX)\n\n\n#### Attempted academic and health institutions and mergers[edit]\n\n\n**DallasâFort Worth**\n\n\nIn 2001 the 77th Texas Legislature proposed HB 3568, which would have merged all DallasâFort Worth UT System institutions (UT Dallas, UT Arlington, and UT Southwestern) under the name \"*The University of Texas at Dallas*\". UTD's Richardson campus would have been designated as the main campus, UTA's Arlington campus would have become a satellite campus, and UTSW's Dallas campus would have become the merged university's medical school.[63] The purpose was to help the metroplex gain one unified flagship-level university, but the House Bill ultimately failed to pass due to objections from UT Arlington (which wanted to retain its identity as a separate university) and the lack of time to properly explain the complex process to state representatives.[64]\n\n\n**San Antonio**\n\n\nNine years later, in 2010, a study was commissioned to explore the possibility of merging UT San Antonio and UT Health San Antonio.[65] Officials ultimately decided against it, citing significant costs, administrative challenges, and different university cultures.[66] In 2016, an op-ed published in the San Antonio Express-News urged the UT System Board of Regents to reconsider their decision, but no further actions from the UT System have been taken since.[67]\n\n\n**Houston**\n\n\nIn 2015, the UT System purchased 300 acres of land in the Houston area for $215 million for the development of a research campus, spearheaded by then-Chancellor William H. McRaven.[68] While the UT System publicly denied plans to build a new university on the land, the land acquisition drew criticism from the University of Houston System and several Texas State Senators, notably John Whitmire, focusing on the UT System encroaching on the UH System, given the UT System's access to the Permanent University Fund, as well as the process by which the land was purchased.[69] In 2017, the UT System announced it would be cancelling plans for the Houston campus.[70][71]\n\n\n\n## Students[edit]\n\n\n\n\nRacial and/or ethnic background (2015)\n|  | Students[72] | Texas[73] | United States[74] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Asian** | 11% | 5% | 6%\n |\n| **Black** | 7% | 13% | 13%\n |\n| **Hispanic** (of any race, includes Tejanos and White Hispanics)\n | 39% | 39% | 18%\n |\n| **Non-Hispanic White** | 30% | 43% | 61%\n |\n| **International student** | 9% | N/A | N/A\n |\n| **Other races or unknown** | 4% | 3% | N/A\n |\n\n\n## Administration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Headquarters\nThe administrative offices are in Downtown Austin.[75] The UT system approved moving the system headquarters in November 2012.[76] Bonds from the UT System's endowment funded the construction of the new 19-story, 330,000-square-foot (31,000Â m2) headquarters, which had a price tag of $102 million. The UT System planned to lease a portion of the facility for shops and other offices, with the approximately 200,000-square-foot (19,000Â m2) remaining portion used for its own employees.[77] The system headquarters opened on August 1, 2017.[78]\n\n\nIn July 2018, the Pentagon announced it had selected the UT System administrative building as the headquarters for the Army Futures Command, a new organization committed to coordinating modernization efforts and integrating innovation across the Army.\n\n\nThe University of Texas System was previously headquartered in O. Henry Hall in Downtown Austin.[79] The system headquarters complex previously included multiple buildings, which had 550 employees in 2014.[77] These facilities included O. Henry Hall, Claudia Taylor Johnson Hall (named after Lady Bird Johnson), Ashbel Smith Hall, the Colorado Building, and the Lavaca Building,\n\n\nIn 2013 the UT system approved the demolitions of the Colorado Building and the Lavaca Building,[76] and the new UT System headquarters was built where these buildings previously stood.[77] The Texas State University System purchased O. Henry Hall in 2015 for $8.2 million;[76] the UT System leased it and continued using it as its administrative headquarters prior to the 2017 completion of the UT System's current headquarters.[80] The UT System leased the land containing Claudia Taylor Johnson Hall and Ashbel Smith Hall to Trammell Crow[76] which is constructing a commercial property on the site that uses the facade of Johnson Hall. Ashbel Smith Hall was imploded on March 25, 2018.[81]\n\n\n\n## Coordinated Admissions Program[edit]\n\n\nThe Coordinated Admissions Program (CAP) offers some UT Austin applicants the chance to attend the university if they complete their freshman year at another system school and meet specified requirements.[82] Each institution in the University of Texas System sets its own admissions standards, and not all schools may accept a particular CAP student.[82]\n\n\nUT Dallas does not participate in the CAP program, and University of Texas at San Antonio, the largest recipient of CAP students, has stated that it will be phasing out the program within the next ten years.[83][84]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Permanent University Fund\n* Education in Texas\n* University of Texas at Austin admissions controversy\n* List of colleges and universities in the United States by endowment over $1 billion\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Seal of the University\". *University of Texas System*.

Through a statewide network of 11 universities and eight state agencies, and the RELLIS Campus, the Texas A&M System educates more than 153,000 students and makes more than 22 million additional educational contacts through service and outreach programs each year. System-wide, research and development expenditures exceeded $996 million in FY 2017 and helped drive the state's economy.[5]\n\n\nThe system's flagship institution is Texas A&M University in College Station. The letters \"A&M\", originally A.M.C. and short for \"Agricultural and Mechanical College\", are retained as a tribute to the university's former designation.\n\n\n\n![](image)Map of Texas A&M University System\n\n\n## Component institutions[edit]\n\n\nThe founding member of the A&M System is Texas A&M University, established in 1876. Prairie View A&M, also established in 1876, is an HBCU. Many of the member universities and agencies joined the A&M System decades after being established.

Founded in 1817, the university is the oldest and largest in Michigan; it was established twenty years before the territory became a state. It is also a founding member of the Association of American Universities.\n\n\nSince 1871, Michigan has been a coeducational institution. In 2021, it enrolled approximately 32,000 undergraduate students and 18,000 graduate students.[8] The university consists of 19 colleges and offers degree programs at undergraduate and graduate levels in some 250 disciplines. Michigan also has two regional universities, one in Flint and one in Dearborn, as well as a center in Detroit. Undergraduate admission to the university is categorized as \"most selective\"[9] and the university is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities â Very high research activity\".\n\n\nThe university's alumni include 8 domestic and foreign heads of state or heads of government; 47 U.S. senators; 218 members of the U.S. House of Representatives; 42 U.S. Cabinet secretaries; 41 U.S. governors; and 26 living billionaires.[10] As of 2022, Wolverine athletes have won 188 medals at the Olympic Games.[11]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the University of Michigan\n\n### 1817â1837[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Michigan was established on August 26, 1817,[1] as *Catholepistemiad*, or *Catholepistemiad Michigania***,** under an act of the Michigan Territory. The corporate existence of the university had its rise in the Act of 1817, and has been continuous throughout all subsequent changes of its organic law.[12]:â11*Catholepistemiad,* a neologism, translates roughly as \"School of Universal Knowledge.\"[13]\n\n\n*Catholepistemiad* was not a university in the contemporary sense but rather a centralized system of schools, libraries, and other cultural institutions borrowing its model from the Imperial University of France founded by Napoleon I a decade earlier.[14][12]:â10 Besides carrying on the central institution, the President and Didactorium of *Catholepistemiad* were also authorized to establish private colleges, academies, libraries, etc., throughout the Michigan Territory.[12]:â10 It was only after the state of Michigan entered the Union in 1837 that a new plan was adopted to focus the corporation on higher education.[14] The charter of *Catholepistemiad* is an extraordinary example of the marked French influence upon American institutions which found its inception during the course of the Revolutionary War, and continued until it began to give way to German influence in the third or fourth decade of the 19th century.[12]:â10\n\n\nShortly after the passage of the Act of 1817, Rev. John Monteith became the first president of *Catholepistemiad*, and Father Gabriel Richard, a Catholic priest, was vice president. Monteith and Richard enacted that private schools should be established in Detroit, Monroe and Mackinaw, and before the end of September, 1817, the three private schools were in operation.[12]:â11 The cornerstone of the first school house, near the corner of Bates Street and Congress Street in Detroit, was laid on September 24, 1817. Subscriptions amounting to $5,000 payable in instalments running over several years were obtained to carry on the work.[12]:â12 Of the total amount subscribed to start the work two-thirds came from Zion Masonic Lodge and its members.[15] In August 1818, a private Lancasterian school taught by Lemuel Shattuck was opened in the building.[12]:â12\n\n\nOn April 30, 1821, the Michigan Territory passed a new act changing materially the appearance and nature of the existing educational organization.[12]:â13 A board of trustees was appointed to oversee the corporation; the positions of president and vice president were eliminated, and Monteith and Richard were appointed to the board.[1] *University of Michigan* took the place of *Catholepistemiad Michigania* as the legal name of the corporation.\n\n\n\n![Painting of a rolling green landscape with trees with a row of white buildings in the background](image)*University of Michigan* (1855) Jasper Francis Cropsey\n### 1837â1900[edit]\n\n\nAfter the state of Michigan entered the Union in 1837, its constitution granted the university an unusual degree of autonomy as a âcoordinate branch of state government.â It delegated full powers over all university matters granted to its governing Board of Regents.[14] On June 3â5, the Board of Regents held its first meeting in Ann Arbor and formally accepted the proposal by the town to locate the university there.[1] The town of Ann Arbor had existed for only 13 years and had a population of about 2,000.[16] A grant of 40 acres (16Â ha), obtained through the Treaty of Fort Meigs,[17] formed the basis of the present Central Campus.[18]\n\n\nSince the founding period, the private sector has remained the primary provider of university financing to supplement tuition collected from students. Early benefactors of the university included businessman Dexter M. Ferry (donor of Ferry Field), Arthur Hill (regent, donor of Hill Auditorium), the Nichols family (regents, donors of the Nichols Arboretum), William E. Upjohn (donor of the Peony\nGarden), William P. Trowbridge, John S. Newberry, who funded the construction of Helen H. Newberry Residence, and Henry N. Walker, a politician who led a group of prominent Detroit businessmen to fund the Detroit Observatory. Clara Harrison Stranahan, a close friend of Scottish-American industrialist Andrew Carnegie, donated $25,000 to the university in 1895 as a memorial of her father, Seth Harrison. The Waterman Gymnasium was financed by donations from wealthy citizens and matched Joshua W. Waterman's pledge of $20,000. When opened, the total cost of the building was $61,876.49, to which private donors contributed $49,524.34.[12]:â67\n\n\n\n![](image)Alexander J. Davis's original University of Michigan designs featured the Gothic Revival style. Davis himself is generally credited with coining the term \"Collegiate Gothic.\"\nIn 1838, the Regents contracted with Alexander Jackson Davis, who according to Superintendent John Davis Pierce provided truly \"magnificent designs\" in the Gothic Revival style; but unfortunately the completion of them at that day would, as Pierce said, involve an expenditure of half a million dollars.[12]:â31 Although approving the designs, the tight budget of the fledgling university forced the Regents to ultimately abandon them and instead adopted a much less expensive plan.[19] The superintendent of construction on the first structure to be built for the university was Isaac Thompson, an associate of Davis.[20] Asa Gray was the first professor appointed to Michigan on July 17, 1837.[21] His position was also the first one devoted solely to botany at any educational institution in America.[22][23][24] The first classes in Ann Arbor were held in 1841, with six freshmen and a sophomore, taught by two professors. Eleven students graduated in the first commencement in 1845.[25]\n\n\n\n![](image)Andrew Dickson White, founder and first president of Cornell University and among the earliest benefactors of Michigan, joined the Michigan faculty in 1858. He made his lasting mark on the grounds of the university by enrolling students to plant elms along the walkways on The Diag, resembling the \"glorious elms\" of Yale.[26]\nThe years 1837â1850 disclosed serious weakness in the organization and working of the university. Regents of the university discovered that the organic act from which they derived their powers, made them too dependent upon the legislature. The subject was brought to the attention of the legislature more than once but without securing the desired action in order to achieve increased independence. By the late 1840s, the Regents achieved a strong position relative to collective bargaining with the legislature as the opinion was becoming common among capitalists, clergymen and intellectual elites, since by then the state derived significant tax revenue through them. Such a situation ultimately led to a change in the organic act of the university. Remodeled, the act, which was approved April 8, 1851, emancipated the university from legislative control that would have been injudicious and harmful. The office of Regent was changed from an appointed one to an elected one, and the office of President was created, with the Regents directed to select one. As Hinsdale argued, \"the independent position of the university has had much to do with its growth and prosperity. In fact, its larger growth may be dated from the time when the new sections began to take effect.\"[12]:â40\n\n\nMichigan was the first university in the West to pursue professional education, establishing its medical school in 1850, engineering courses in 1854, and a law school in 1859.[14] The university was among the first to introduce instruction in fields as diverse as zoology and botany, modern languages, modern history, American literature, pharmacy, dentistry, speech, journalism, teacher education, forestry, bacteriology, naval architecture, aeronautical engineering, computer engineering, and nuclear engineering.[14] In 1856, Michigan built the nation's first chemical laboratory.[27] That laboratory was the first structure on the North American continent that was designed and equipped solely for instruction in chemistry.[27] In 1869 Michigan opened the first university hospital in the country. James Burrill Angell, who served as the university's president from 1871 to 1909, expanded the curriculum to include professional studies in dentistry, architecture, engineering, government, and medicine.\n\n\nThe University of Michigan conferred the degree of Bachelor of Science in 1855, four years after the Lawrence Scientific School at Cambridge conferred the degree in 1851, for the first time in the United States, making Michigan the second institution in the country to confer the degree.[12]:â48 The degree of Bachelor of Philosophy was conferred for the first time in the university's history upon six students in 1870.[12]:â79 The degrees of Master of Philosophy and Doctor of Philosophy was first offered in 1875.[12]:â88\n\n\nMethods of instruction had also undergone important changes. The *seminar* method of study was first introduced into the university by Charles Kendall Adams in 1871â1872, making the university the first American institution to naturalize this product of the German soil.[28][12]:â71\n\n\nBy 1866, enrollment had increased to 1,205 students. Women were first admitted in 1870,[29] although Alice Robinson Boise Wood had become the first woman to attend classes (without matriculating) in 1866â7.[30] Among the early students in the School of Medicine was Jose Celso Barbosa, who in 1880 graduated as valedictorian and the first Puerto Rican to get a university degree in the United States. He returned to Puerto Rico to practice medicine and also served in high-ranking posts in the government.[31] Michigan was involved with the building of the Philippine education, legal, and public health systems during the era of the American colonization of the Philippines through the efforts of Michigan alumni that included Dean Conant Worcester and George A. Malcolm.[32]\n\n\nThroughout its history, Michigan has been one of the nation's largest universities, vying with the largest private universities such as Harvard University and Columbia University (then known as Columbia College) during the 19th and early 20th centuries, and then holding this position of national leadership until the emergence of the statewide public university systems in the post-WWII years.[14] By the turn of the 19th century, the university was the second largest in the United States after Harvard University.[33]\n\n\nDescendants of Massachusetts founding families made up a large portion of the university population in the 19th century; among them was Regent Charles Hebard, a lineal descendant of William Bradford, a founding father of Plymouth Colony.[12]:â204\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe Diag, ca. 1900\n\nFrom 1900 to 1920, the growth of higher education led the university to build numerous new facilities. The Martha Cook Building was constructed as an all-female residence in 1915 as the result of a gift from William Wilson Cook in honor of his mother, Martha Walford Cook.[34]\nCook planned to endow a professorship of law of corporations, but eventually made possible the development of the Law Quadrangle.[35] The five buildings comprising the Law Quadrangle were constructed during the decade of 1923â33 on two city blocks purchased by the university: Lawyers Club, Dormitory Wing, John P. Cook Dormitory, William W Cook Legal Research Library, and Hutchins Hall.[35] The buildings, in the Tudor Gothic style, recalled the quadrangles of the two English ancient universities Oxford and Cambridge.[35]\n\n\n\n![](image)Physicists George Uhlenbeck, Hendrik Kramers, and Samuel Goudsmit circa 1928 at Michigan.\n![](image)\n![](image)\nWest Engineering Building, 1905\n\nFrom 1915 to 1941, the physics department was led by Harrison M. Randall, who established the importance of theoretical colleagues. Oskar Klein, Samuel Goudsmit, George Uhlenbeck, Otto Laporte and David Dennison joined the physics faculty during this time. Theoretical physicist Wolfgang Pauli, who became known as one of the pioneers of quantum physics, held a visiting professorship at the university in 1931.[36] Other physicists with ties to the university include the inventor of the Race Track Synchrotron H. Richard Crane and Hendrik Kramers. The Michigan Summer Symposia in Theoretical Physics occurred from 1927 to 1941 and provided lectures from theorists, including Niels Bohr, Paul Dirac, Enrico Fermi, Werner Heisenberg, and others.[36] J. Robert Oppenheimer lectured on the \"General Quantum Theory of Transitions\" at the university in 1931.[36]\n\n\nIn August 1946, Rensis Likert and his team formed the Survey Research Center at the University of Michigan. This became the Institute for Social Research (ISR) in 1949 when Dorwin Cartwright moved the Group Dynamics Research Center, the first institute devoted explicitly to group dynamics, from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to the University of Michigan.\n\n\nThe University of Michigan has been the birthplace of some important academic movements, establishing the Michigan schools of thought and developing the Michigan Models in various fields. John Dewey, Charles Horton Cooley, George Herbert Mead, and Robert Ezra Park first met at Michigan. There, they would influence each other greatly.[37] In political science, Angus Campbell, Philip Converse, Warren Miller and Donald Stokes, proposed the Michigan model of voting.[38] In business administration, Michigan Business School developed the Michigan model of human resource management in 1984. \n\n\nShortly after the war, in 1947, the Regents appointed a War Memorial Committee to consider establishing a war memorial in honor of students and alumni who fell in World War II, and in 1948, approved a resolution to \"create a war memorial center to explore the ways and means by which the potentialities of atomic energy may become a beneficent influence in the life of man, to be known as the Phoenix Project of the University of Michigan\", leading to the world's first academic program in nuclear science and engineering.[39][14] The Memorial Phoenix Project was funded by over 25,000 private contributors by individuals and corporations, such as the Ford Motor Company.[40]\n\n\nDuring the 1960s, the university campus was the site of numerous protests against the Vietnam War and university administration. On March 24, 1965, a group of U-M faculty members and 3,000 students held the nation's first-ever faculty-led \"teach-in\" to protest against American policy in Southeast Asia.[41][42][43] In response to a series of sit-ins in 1966 by *Voice*, the campus political party of Students for a Democratic Society, U-M's administration banned sit-ins. In response, 1,500 students participated in a one-hour sit-in inside the Administration Building, now known as the LSA Building. In April 1968, following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., a group of several dozen black students occupied the Administration Building to demand that the university make public its three-year-old commitment as a federal contractor to affirmative action and to increase its efforts with respect to recruiting more African American students, faculty and staff. At that time there were no African American coaches, for instance, in the Intercollegiate Athletics Department. The university's Spectrum Center is the oldest collegiate LGBT student center in the U.S., pre-dating Penn's.[44]\n\n\nDue to concerns over the university's financial situation there have been suggestions for the complete separation of the university and state through privatization.[45][46] Even though the university is a public institution *de jure*, it has embraced funding models of a private university that emphasize tuition funding and raising funds from private donors.[47] Considering that \"the University of Michigan already has only minimal fiscal ties to the state,\" the legislature convened a panel in 2008 that recommended converting the University of Michigan from a public to a private institution.[48]\n\n\n\n### Historical links[edit]\n\n\n![](image)John Dewey, founder of the University of Chicago Laboratory School\nThe University of Michigan was the first attempt in the New World to build a modern university in the European sense. The institution was the clearest and strongest presentation that had yet been made of what, in this country, at once came to be called the \"Prussian ideas.\" It was a radically different approach to higher education; a complete civil system of education, in contradistinction to the ecclesiastical system made out of the colonial colleges. Michigan alumni and faculty members carried this newer concept of the university with them as they founded other institutions including Andrew Dixon White, a cofounder of Cornell University.[14] Cornell alumni David Starr Jordan and John Casper Branner passed the concept to Stanford University in the late 19th century.\n\n\nMichigan also has many historical links to other American universities through its graduates.\n\n\n\n* University of California: had its early planning based upon the University of Michigan.[49][50]\n* University of Chicago: Michigan alumnus Robert Ezra Park played a leading role in the development of the Chicago School of sociology. The University of Chicago Laboratory School was founded in 1896 by John Dewey and Calvin Brainerd Cady, who were members of the Michigan faculty.\n* Cornell University: had its Law School founded by Michigan alumni Charles Kendall Adams and Harry Burns Hutchins.\n* Harvard University: Michigan alumnus Edwin Francis Gay was the founding dean of the Harvard Business School from 1908 to 1919,[51] instrumental in the school's planning.\n* Johns Hopkins University: had its pharmacology department established by John Jacob Abel, an alumnus of Michigan.\n* Massachusetts Institute of Technology: had its Media Lab, the world's leading research laboratory, founded by Michigan alumnus Jerome Wiesner.\n* Northwestern University: Michigan alumnus Henry Wade Rogers was instrumental in transforming Northwestern from a small cluster of colleges into a major, nationally recognized university. His wife, Emma Winner Rogers, founded the Northwestern University Settlement Association.[52]\n* Tufts University: had its College of Civic Life founded by John Angelo DiBiaggio, an alumnus of Michigan.[53]\n* Wellesley College: Michigan alumna Alice Freeman Palmer, the President of Wellesley College from 1881 to 1887, \"transformed the fledgling school from one devoted to Christian domesticity into one of the nation's premier colleges for women.\"[54]\n* Yale University: had its residential college system co-organized by James Rowland Angell, a graduate of Michigan.[55] Michigan alumnus Henry Wade Rogers introduced the \"case system\" and the college degree requirement into the Yale Law School.\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\nThe Ann Arbor campus is divided into four main areas: the North, Central, Medical, and South campuses. The physical infrastructure includes more than 500 major buildings,[56] with a combined area of more than 37.48Â million square feet (860 acres; 3.482Â km2).[57] The Central and South Campus areas are contiguous, while the North Campus area is separated from them, primarily by the Huron River.[58] There is also leased space in buildings scattered throughout the city, many occupied by organizations affiliated with the University of Michigan Health System. An East Medical Campus was developed on Plymouth Road, with several university-owned buildings for outpatient care, diagnostics, and outpatient surgery.[59]\n\n\nIn addition to the U-M Golf Course on South Campus, the university operates a second golf course on Geddes Road called Radrick Farms Golf Course. The golf course is only open to faculty, staff and alumni.[60] Another off-campus facility is the Inglis House, which the university has owned since the 1950s. The Inglis House is a 10,000-square-foot (930Â m2) mansion used to hold various social events, including meetings of the Board of Regents, and to host visiting dignitaries.[61] The university also operates a large office building called Wolverine Tower in southern Ann Arbor near Briarwood Mall. Another major facility is the Matthaei Botanical Gardens, which is located on the eastern outskirts of Ann Arbor.[62]\n\n\nAll four campus areas are connected by bus services, the majority of which connect the North and Central campuses. There is a shuttle service connecting the University Hospital, which lies between North and Central campuses, with other medical facilities throughout northeastern Ann Arbor.[63]\n\n\nThe 2021 state budget boosted University of Michigan funding by 5% across all 3 campuses.[64]\n\n\nThe university has also seen increases in their sustainability efforts through climate, energy, food systems, water, and construction.[65]\n\n\n\n### Central Campus[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: University of Michigan Central Campus Historic District\n\nCentral Campus was the original location of U-M when it moved to Ann Arbor in 1837. It originally had a school and dormitory building (where Mason Hall now stands) and several houses for professors on 40 acres (16Â ha) of land bounded by North University Avenue, South University Avenue, East University Avenue, and State Street. The President's House, located on South University Avenue, is the oldest building on campus as well as the only surviving building from the original 40-acre (16Â ha) campus.[18] Because Ann Arbor and Central Campus developed simultaneously, there is no distinct boundary between the city and university, and some areas contain a mixture of private and university buildings.[66] Residence halls located on Central Campus are split up into two groups: the Hill Neighborhood and Central Campus.[67]\n\n\nCentral Campus is the location of the College of Literature, Science and the Arts, and is immediately adjacent to the medical campus. Most of the graduate and professional schools, including the Ross School of Business, the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy, the Law School and the School of Dentistry, are on Central Campus. Two prominent libraries, the Harlan Hatcher Graduate Library and the Shapiro Undergraduate Library (which are connected by a skywalk), are also on Central Campus.[68] as well as museums housing collections in archaeology, anthropology, paleontology, zoology, dentistry and art. Ten of the buildings on Central Campus were designed by Detroit-based architect Albert Kahn between 1904 and 1936 including Burton Memorial Tower and Hill Auditorium.[69]\n\n\n\n### North Campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Earl V. Moore Building on North Campus\nNorth Campus is the most contiguous campus, built independently from the city on a large plot of farmlandâapproximately 800 acres (3.2Â km2)âthat the university bought in 1952.[70] It is newer than Central Campus, and thus has more modernist architecture, whereas most Central Campus buildings are classical or Collegiate Gothic in style. The architect Eero Saarinen, based in Birmingham, Michigan, created one of the early master plans for North Campus and designed several of its buildings in the 1950s, including the Earl V. Moore School of Music Building.[71] North and Central Campuses each have unique bell towers that reflect the predominant architectural styles of their surroundings. Each of the bell towers houses a grand carillon, 2 of only 57 globally. The North Campus tower is called Lurie Tower.[72] The University of Michigan's largest residence hall, Bursley Hall, is located on North Campus.[67]\n\n\nNorth Campus houses the College of Engineering, the School of Music, Theatre & Dance, the Stamps School of Art & Design, the Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning, and an annex of the School of Information.[73] The campus is served by the Duderstadt Center, which houses the Art, Architecture and Engineering Library. The Duderstadt Center also contains multiple computer labs, video editing studios, electronic music studios, an audio studio, a video studio, multimedia workspaces, and a 3D virtual reality room.[74] Other libraries located on North Campus include the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library and the Bentley Historical Library.\n\n\n\n### South Campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)University of Michigan Golf Course was designed by Scottish golf course architect Alister MacKenzie and opened in 1931.\nSouth Campus is the site for the athletic programs, including major sports facilities such as Michigan Stadium, Crisler Center, and Yost Ice Arena. South Campus is also the site of the Buhr library storage facility, Revelli Hall, home of the Michigan Marching Band, the Institute for Continuing Legal Education,[75] and the Student Theatre Arts Complex, which provides shop and rehearsal space for student theatre groups.[76] The university's departments of public safety and transportation services offices are located on South Campus.[75]\n\n\nU-M's golf course is located south of Michigan Stadium and Crisler Center. It was designed in the late 1920s by Alister MacKenzie, the designer of Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia, home of the Masters Tournament.[77] The course opened to the public in the spring of 1931. The University of Michigan Golf Course was included in a listing of top holes designed by what *Sports Illustrated* calls \"golf's greatest course architect\". The U-M Golf Course's signature No. 6 holeâa 310-yard (280Â m) par 4, which plays from an elevated tee to a two-tiered, kidney-shaped green protected by four bunkersâis the second hole on the Alister MacKenzie Dream 18 as selected by a five-person panel that includes three-time Masters champion Nick Faldo and golf course architect Tom Doak. The listing of \"the best holes ever designed by Augusta National architect Alister MacKenzie\" is featured in SI's Golf Plus special edition previewing the Masters on April 4, 2006.[78]\n\n\n\n## Organization and administration[edit]\n\n\nSee also: President of the University of Michigan and Board of Regents of the University of Michigan\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **College/school** | **Year founded**[79] |\n| Literature, Science, and the Arts | 1841\n |\n| Medicine | 1850\n |\n| Engineering | 1854\n |\n| Law | 1859\n |\n| Dentistry | 1875\n |\n| Pharmacy | 1876\n |\n| Music, Theatre & Dance | 1880\n |\n| Nursing | 1893\n |\n| Architecture & Urban Planning | 1906\n |\n| Graduate Studies | 1912\n |\n| Government | 1914\n |\n| Education | 1921\n |\n| Business | 1924\n |\n| Environment and Sustainability | 1927\n |\n| Public Health | 1941\n |\n| Social Work | 1951\n |\n| Information | 1969\n |\n| Art & Design | 1974\n |\n| Kinesiology | 1984\n |\n\n\nThe University of Michigan consists of a flagship campus in Ann Arbor, with two regional campuses in Dearborn and Flint. The Board of Regents, which governs the university and was established by the Organic Act of March 18, 1837, consists of eight members elected at large in biennial state elections[80] for overlapping eight-year terms.[81][82] Between the establishment of the University of Michigan in 1837 and 1850, the Board of Regents ran the university directly; although they were, by law, supposed to appoint a Chancellor to administer the university, they never did. Instead, a rotating roster of professors carried out the day-to-day administration duties.[83]\n\n\nThe President of the University of Michigan is the principal executive officer of the university. The office was created by the Michigan Constitution of 1850, which also specified that the president was to be appointed by the Regents of the University of Michigan and preside at their meetings, but without a vote.[84] Today, the president's office is at the Ann Arbor campus, and the president has the privilege of living in the President's House, the university's oldest building.[85] Mark Schlissel was president from July 2014 to January 2022, when he was fired by the board after an investigation determined he \"may have been involved in an inappropriate relationship with an employee of the university\".[86]\n\n\n\n![](image)Samuel Trask Dana Building (West Medical Building) houses the School for Environment and Sustainability\nThere are thirteen undergraduate schools and colleges.[87] By enrollment, the three largest undergraduate units are the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, the College of Engineering, and the Ross School of Business.[88] At the graduate level, the Rackham Graduate School serves as the central administrative unit of graduate education at the university.[89] There are 18 graduate schools and colleges. Professional degrees are conferred by the Schools of Architecture, Public Health, Dentistry, Law, Medicine, Urban Planning and Pharmacy.[88] The Medical School is partnered with the University of Michigan Health System, which comprises the university's three hospitals, dozens of outpatient clinics, and many centers for medical care, research, and education.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Student government[edit]\n\n\nHoused in the Michigan Union, the Central Student Government (CSG) is the central student government of the university. With representatives from each of the university's colleges and schools, including graduate students, CSG represents students and manages student funds on the campus. CSG is a 501(c)(3) organization, independent from the University of Michigan.[90] In recent years CSG has organized Airbus, a transportation service between campus and the Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport, and has led the university's efforts to register its student population to vote, with its Voice Your Vote Commission (VYV) registering 10,000 students in 2004. VYV also works to improve access to non-partisan voting-related information and increase student voter turnout.[91] CSG was successful at reviving Homecoming activities, including a carnival and parade, for students after a roughly eleven-year absence in October 2007,[92] and during the 2013â14 school year, was instrumental in persuading the university to rescind an unpopular change in student football seating policy at Michigan Stadium.[93] In 2017, CSG successfully petitioned the Ann Arbor City Council to create a Student Advisory Council to give student input into Ann Arbor city affairs.[94]\n\n\nThere are student governance bodies in each college and school, independent of Central Student Government. Undergraduate students in the LS&A are represented by the LS&A Student Government (LSA SG).[95] Engineering Student Government (ESG) manages undergraduate student government affairs for the College of Engineering. Graduate students enrolled in the Rackham Graduate School are represented by the Rackham Student Government (RSG), and law students are represented by the Law School Student Senate (LSSS) as is each other college with its own respective government. In addition, the students who live in the residence halls are represented by the University of Michigan Residence Halls Association (RHA), which contains the third most constituents after CSG and LSA SG.[96]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nWilliam W. Cook Legal Research Library and other buildings comprising the Law Quadrangle were built during 1923â33 and then donated to the university by William Wilson Cook. It was the university's most significant private gift at the time.\n\nA longstanding goal of the student government is to create a student-designated seat on the Board of Regents, the university's governing body.[97] Such a designation would achieve parity with other Big Ten schools that have student regents. In 2000, students Nick Waun and Scott Trudeau ran for the board on the statewide ballot as third-party nominees. Waun ran for a second time in 2002, along with Matt Petering and Susan Fawcett.[98] Although none of these campaigns has been successful, a poll conducted by the State of Michigan in 1998 concluded that a majority of Michigan voters would approve of such a position if the measure were put before them.[97] A change to the board's makeup would require amending the Michigan Constitution.[99]\n\n\n\n### Finances[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2019[update], U-M's financial endowment (the \"University Endowment Fund\") was valued at $12.4 billion.[100]\n\n\nIn the 1980s, the university received increased grants for research in the social and physical sciences. During the 1980s and 1990s, the university devoted substantial resources to renovating its massive hospital complex and improving the academic facilities on the North Campus. In the early 2000s, Michigan faced declining state funding due to state budget shortfalls. In fact, the university did not receive direct state appropriations until 1867, and for most of its history, state support has been limited.[14] The state's annual contribution to the school's operating budget was less than 6%. In 2011 less than 5% of its support comes from state appropriations, a number continued to drop.[14]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Academic rankings |\n| --- |\n| National |\n| *ARWU*[101] | 18 |\n| *Forbes*[102] | 23 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[103] | 21 |\n| *Washington Monthly*[104] | 23 |\n| *WSJ*/*College Pulse*[105] | 28 |\n| Global |\n| *ARWU*[106] | 26 |\n| *QS*[107] | 33 |\n| *THE*[108] | 23 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[109] | 19 |\n\n\nThe University of Michigan is a large, four-year, residential research university accredited by the Higher Learning Commission.[110][111][112] The four-year, full-time undergraduate program comprises the majority of enrollments and emphasizes instruction in the arts, sciences, and professions with a high level of coexistence between graduate and undergraduate programs. The university has \"very high\" research activity and the comprehensive graduate program offers doctoral degrees in the humanities, social sciences, and STEM fields as well as professional degrees in medicine, law, and dentistry.[110] U-M has been included on Richard Moll's list of Public Ivies.[113] With over 200 undergraduate majors, and 100 doctoral and 90 master's programs,[114] U-M conferred 6,490 undergraduate degrees, 4,951 graduate degrees, and 709 first professional degrees in 2011â2012.[115] Its most popular undergraduate majors, by 2021 graduates, were:[116]\n\n\n\nComputer and Information Sciences (874)\nBusiness Administration and Management (610)\nEconomics (542)\nBehavioral Neuroscience (319)\nMechanical Engineering (316)\nExperimental Psychology (312)\nThe 2021 *U.S. News & World Report* Best Colleges report ranked Michigan 3rd among public universities in the United States.[117] Michigan was ranked 6th in the 2021 *U.S. News & World Report* Best Undergraduate

the founding members (in the year 1900) of the Association of American Universities. With over 6,200 faculty members, 73 of whom are members of the National Academy and 471 of whom hold an endowed chair in their discipline,[133] the university manages one of the largest annual collegiate research budgets of any university in the United States. According to the National Science Foundation, Michigan spent $1.639 billion on research and development in 2021, ranking it 3rd in the nation.[134] This figure totaled over $1 billion in 2009.[135] The Medical School spent the most at over $445 million, while the College of Engineering was second at more than $160 million.[135] U-M also has a technology transfer office, which is the university conduit between laboratory research and corporate commercialization interests.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Thomas Henry Simpson Memorial Institute for Medical Research was constructed in 1924 as the result of a donation from the widow of iron magnate Thomas H. Simpson, in memory of her late husband, who had died of pernicious anemia\nIn 2009, U-M signed an agreement to purchase a facility formerly owned by Pfizer. The acquisition includes over 170 acres (0.69Â km2) of property, and 30 major buildings comprising roughly 1,600,000 square feet (150,000Â m2) of wet laboratory space, and 400,000 square feet (37,000Â m2) of administrative space. At the time of the agreement, the university's intentions for the space were not fully articulated, but the expectation was that the new space would allow the university to ramp up its research and ultimately employ in excess of 2,000 people.[136]\n\n\nThe university is also a major contributor to the medical field with the EKG[137] and the gastroscope.[138] The university's 13,000-acre (53Â km2) biological station in the Northern Lower Peninsula of Michigan is one of only 47 Biosphere Reserves in the United States.[139]\n\n\nIn the mid-1960s U-M researchers worked with IBM to develop a new virtual memory architectural model[140] that model became part of IBM's Model 360/67 mainframe computer (the 360/67 was initially dubbed the 360/65M where the \"M\" stood for Michigan).[141] The Michigan Terminal System (MTS), an early time-sharing computer operating system developed at U-M, was the first system outside of IBM to use the 360/67's virtual memory features.[142]\n\n\n\n\n\n*R&D statistics, by year*[143][144][145][146]\n|  | TotalResearchx $1000 | NationalRank | FederalResearchx $1000 | NationalRank | NationalAcademyMembers | NationalRank\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2017\n | 1,434,535\n | 2\n | 822,436\n | 3\n | 118\n | 9\n |\n| 2016\n | 1,357,228\n | 2\n | 780,080\n | 3\n | 113\n | 12\n |\n| 2015\n | 1,300,340\n | 2\n | 728,712\n | 3\n | 108\n | 13\n |\n| 2014\n | 1,279,603\n | 2\n | 733,779\n | 3\n | 106\n | 13\n |\n\n\nU-M is home to the National Election Studies and the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index. The Correlates of War project, also located at U-M, is an accumulation of scientific knowledge about war. The university is also home to major research centers in optics, reconfigurable manufacturing systems, wireless integrated microsystems, and social sciences. The University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute and the Life Sciences Institute are located at the university. The Institute for Social Research (ISR), the nation's longest-standing laboratory for interdisciplinary research in the social sciences,[147] is home to the Survey Research Center, Research Center for Group Dynamics, Center for Political Studies, Population Studies Center, and Inter-Consortium for Political and Social Research. Undergraduate students are able to participate in various research projects through the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP) as well as the UROP/Creative-Programs.[148]\n\n\nThe U-M library system comprises nineteen individual libraries with twenty-four separate collectionsâroughly 13.3 million volumes as of 2012.[149] U-M was the original home of the JSTOR database, which contains about 750,000 digitized pages from the entire pre-1990 backfile of ten journals of history and economics, and has initiated a book digitization program in collaboration with Google.[150] The University of Michigan Press is also a part of the U-M library system.\n\n\nIn the late 1960s U-M, together with Michigan State University and Wayne State University, founded the Merit Network, one of the first university computer networks.[151] The Merit Network was then and remains today administratively hosted by U-M. Another major contribution took place in 1987 when a proposal submitted by the Merit Network together with its partners IBM, MCI, and the State of Michigan won a national competition to upgrade and expand the National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET) backbone from 56,000 to 1.5 million, and later to 45 million bits per second.[152] In 2006, U-M joined with Michigan State University and Wayne State University to create the University Research Corridor. This effort was undertaken to highlight the capabilities of the state's three leading research institutions and drive the transformation of Michigan's economy.[153] The three universities are electronically interconnected via the Michigan LambdaRail (MiLR, pronounced 'MY-lar'), a high-speed data network providing 10 Gbit/s connections between the three university campuses and other national and international network connection points in Chicago.[154]\n\n\nIn May 2021, the university announced plans to cut carbon emissions from its campuses. The plan covers all of its operations and goals include removing emissions from direct, on-campus sources by 2040.[155]\n\n\n\n## Student body[edit]\n\n\n### Undergraduate admissions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Undergraduate admissions statistics |\n| --- |\n| 2021 enteringclass[156]\n\n\n---\n\n |\n| Admit rate | 19.5%(16,235 out of 83,029) |\n| Yield rate | 46.4% |\n| Test scores middle 50% |\n| SAT EBRW | 680â760 |\n| SAT Math | 710â790 |\n| ACT Composite | 32â35 |\n| High school GPA |\n| Average | 3.90 |\n|  |\n\n\nThe requirements for admission to the freshman class were first published in August 1841, with fluency in ancient languages, such as Latin and Greek, being among the many requirements.[12]:â33 Candidates for admission to the freshman class were examined in English grammar, geography, arithmetic, algebra, Virgil, Cicero's Select Orations, Jacob's or Felton's Greek Reader, Andrews and Stoddard's Latin Grammar, and Sophocles's Greek Grammar. In 1851, the university dropped the requirement for students who did not wish to pursue the usual collegiate course embracing the ancient languages, permitting their admission without examination in such languages.[12]:â44 This provision may be considered a prelude to scientific education.\n\n\nRequirements for admission varied from department to department in the early days, and admissions were mostly given by referral. Candidates were required to do no more than satisfying professors on such inquiry as professors saw fit to make of their ability to do the work to obtain admission to the university. Such a practice was deemed flawed, eventually leading to corruption. In 1863, a rigid generalized entrance examination was imposed, creating one standard of qualifications for admission to all the departments, academical and professional.[12]:â79 The early administration praised the then-new practice for its role in strengthening admission to the university.[12]:â44 The entrance examination imposed in 1863 had played a significant role in the admission process during the 19th century until the emergence of the nationwide standardized tests, which were not offered until 1900.\n\n\nAdmission is based on academic prowess, extracurricular activities, and personal qualities. *U.S. News & World Report* rates Michigan \"Most Selective\"[9] and The Princeton Review rates its admissions selectivity of 96 out of 99.[157] Admissions are characterized as \"more selective, lower transfer-in\" according to the Carnegie Classification.[110][158] The university is need-blind for domestic applicants.[159]\n\n\nMichigan received over 83,000 applications for a place in the 2021â22 freshman class, making it one of the most applied-to universities in the United States.[158][160] In recent years, annual numbers of applications for freshman admission have exceeded 83,000. Around 16,000 students are offered admission annually, with a target freshman class of more than 7,000 students.[158] Students come from all 50 U.S. states and nearly 100 countries.[158] In academic year 2019â20 full-time undergraduate students made up about 97 percent of the undergraduate student body, with a first-time student retention rate of almost 97 percent.[156]\n\n\nIn 2003, two lawsuits involving U-M's affirmative action admissions policy reached the U.S. Supreme Court (*Grutter v. Bollinger* and *Gratz v. Bollinger*). President George W. Bush publicly opposed the policy before the court issued a ruling.[161] The court found that race may be considered as a factor in university admissions in all public universities and private universities that accept federal funding, but it ruled that a point system was unconstitutional. In the first case, the court upheld the Law School admissions policy, while in the second it ruled against the university's undergraduate admissions policy.[*citation needed*] The debate continued because in November 2006, Michigan voters passed Proposal 2, banning most affirmative action in university admissions. Under that law, race, gender, and national origin can no longer be considered in admissions.[162] U-M and other organizations were granted a stay from implementation of the law soon after that referendum. This allowed time for proponents of affirmative action to decide legal and constitutional options in response to the initiative results. In April 2014, the Supreme Court ruled in *Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action* that Proposal 2 did not violate the U.S. Constitution. The admissions office states that it will attempt to achieve a diverse student body by looking at other factors, such as whether the student attended a disadvantaged school, and the level of education of the student's parents.[162]\n\n\n\n### Enrollment[edit]\n\n\n\n\nStudent body composition as of May 2, 2022\n| Race and ethnicity[163] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| White | 55%\n | 55 |\n| Asian | 16%\n | 16 |\n| Other[a] | 10%\n | 10 |\n| Hispanic | 7%\n | 7 |\n| Foreign national | 7%\n | 7 |\n| Black | 5%\n | 5 |\n| Economic diversity |\n| Low-income[b] | 18%\n | 18 |\n| Affluent[c] | 82%\n | 82 |\n\n\nIn Fall 2016, the university had an enrollment of 44,718 students: 28,983 undergraduate students, 12,565 graduate students and 2,665 first professional students[8][88] in a total of 600 academic programs. Of all students, 37,954 (84.9%) are U.S. citizens or permanent residents and 6,764 (15.1%) are international students.[8]\n\n\nIn 2014, undergraduates were enrolled in 12 schools or colleges: About 61 percent in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts; 21 percent in the College of Engineering; 5.3 percent in the Ross School of Business; 3.3 percent in the School of Kinesiology; 2.7 percent in the School of Music, Theatre & Dance; and 2 percent in the School of Nursing. Small numbers of undergraduates were enrolled in the colleges or schools of Art & Design, Architecture & Urban Planning, Dentistry, Education, Pharmacy, and Public Policy.[88] In 2014, the School of Information opened to undergraduates, with the new Bachelor of Science in Information degree. Among undergraduates, 70 percent graduate with a bachelor's degree within four years, 86 percent graduate within five years and 88 percent graduating within six years.[164]\n\n\n\n![](image)West Hall at the Southeast corner of the Diag\nOf the university's 12,714 non-professional graduate students, 5,367 are seeking academic doctorates and 6,821 are seeking master's degrees. The largest number of master's degree students are enrolled in the Ross School of Business (1,812 students seeking MBA or Master of Accounting degrees) and the College of Engineering (1,456 students seeking M.S. or M.Eng. degrees). The largest number of doctoral students are enrolled in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (2,076) and College of Engineering (1,496). While the majority of U-M's graduate degree-granting schools and colleges have both undergraduate and graduate students, a few schools only issue graduate degrees. Presently, the School for Environment and Sustainability, School of Public Health, and School of Social Work only have graduate students.[88]\n\n\nIn Fall 2014, 3,411 Michigan students were enrolled in U-M's professional schools: the School of Dentistry (628 students), Law School (1,047 students), Medical School (1,300 students), and College of Pharmacy (436 students).[88]\n\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\n### Residential life[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University of Michigan Housing\n\n![Law Quadrangle](image)Law Quadrangle, constructed during the decade of 1923â33, was designed by York and Sawyer in the Tudor style and recalled the quadrangles of two ancient English universities, Oxford and Cambridge.\nThe University of Michigan's campus housing system can accommodate approximately 10,000 students, or nearly 25 percent of the total student population at the university.[165] The residence halls are located in three distinct geographic areas on campus: Central Campus, Hill Area (between Central Campus and the University of Michigan Medical Center) and North Campus. Family housing is located on North Campus and mainly serves graduate students. The largest residence hall has a capacity of 1,270 students,[166] while the smallest accommodates 25 residents.[167] A majority of upper-division and graduate students live in off-campus apartments, houses, and cooperatives, with the largest concentrations in the Central and South Campus areas.\n\n\n\n![](image)Statue of Portia, above the front entrance to the Martha Cook Residence Hall\n![](image)Lawyers Club Dining Hall\nThe residential system has a number of \"living-learning communities\" where academic activities and residential life are combined. These communities focus on areas such as research through the Michigan Research and Discovery Scholars, medical sciences, community service and the German language.[168] The Michigan Research and Discovery Scholars and the Women in Science and Engineering Residence Program are housed in Mosher-Jordan Hall. The Residential College (RC), a living-learning community that is a division of the College of Literature, Science and the Arts, also has its principal instructional space in East Quad. The Michigan Community Scholars Program, dedicated to civic engagement, community service learning and intercultural understanding and dialogue, is located in West Quad.[169] The Lloyd Hall Scholars Program (LHSP) is located in Alice Lloyd Hall. The Health Sciences Scholars Program (HSSP) is located in Couzens Hall. The North Quad complex houses two additional living-learning communities: the Global Scholars Program[170] and the Max Kade German Program.[171] It is \"technology-rich,\" and houses communication-related programs, including the School of Information, the Department of Communication Studies, and the Department of Screen Arts and Cultures.[172][173] North Quad is also home to services such as the Language Resource Center and the Sweetland Center for Writing.[174]\n\n\n\n![](image)Betsy Barbour Residence Hall, one of three all-female residence halls on campus, was designed by Albert Kahn in the English Georgian style.\nThe residential system also has a number of \"theme communities\" where students have the opportunity to be surrounded by students in a residential hall who share similar interests. These communities focus on global leadership, the college transition experience, and internationalism.[175] The Adelia Cheever Program is housed in the Helen Newberry House.[176] The First Year Experience is housed in the Baits II Houses and Markley Hall along with portions of all other buildings with the exception of North Quad, Northwood, and Stockwell Hall.[177] The Sophomore Experience is housed in Stockwell Hall and the Transfer Year Experience is housed in Northwood III.[178][179] The newly organized International Impact program is housed in North Quad.[180]\n\n\n\n![](image)Stockwell Residence Hall\n### Groups and activities[edit]\n\n\nThe university lists 1,438 student organizations, including Omega Omega Omega (OOO), the nation's first mental health fraternity.[181][182] The student body is politically engaged, though, with 96% stating they intended to vote in the 2020 election. It is largely progressive, with 43% identifying as very liberal, 33% as somewhat liberal, and 13% moderate. 11% identified as conservative or very conservative.[183] With a history of student activism, some of the most visible groups include those dedicated to causes such as civil rights and labor rights, such as local chapters of Students for a Democratic Society and United Students Against Sweatshops. Conservative groups also organize, such as the Young Americans for Freedom.[184]\n\n\n\n![](image)Michigan Union, an Art Deco building constructed on land wholly owned by the student society in 1917, was designed by Michigan alumni Irving Kane Pond and Allen Bartlit Pond.\nThere are also several engineering projects teams, including the University of Michigan Solar Car Team, which has placed first in the North American Solar Challenge six times and third in the World Solar Challenge four times.[185] Michigan Interactive Investments,[186] the TAMID Israel Investment Group, and the Michigan Economics Society[187] are also affiliated with the university.\n\n\nThe university also showcases many community service organizations and charitable projects, including Foundation for International Medical Relief of Children, Dance Marathon at the University of Michigan,[188] The Detroit Partnership, Relay For Life, U-M Stars for the Make-A-Wish Foundation, InnoWorks at the University of Michigan, SERVE, Letters to Success, PROVIDES, Circle K, Habitat for Humanity,[189] and Ann Arbor Reaching Out. Intramural sports are popular, and there are recreation facilities for each of the three campuses.[190]\n\n\nFraternities and sororities play a role in the university's social life; approximately seven percent of undergraduate men and 16% of undergraduate women are active in the Greek system.[191] Four different Greek councilsâthe Interfraternity Council, Multicultural Greek Council, National Pan-Hellenic Council, and Panhellenic Associationârepresent most Greek organizations. Each council has a different recruitment process.[192]\n\n\nThe Michigan Union and Michigan League are student activity centers located on Central Campus; Pierpont Commons is on North Campus. The Michigan Union houses a majority of student groups, including the student government. The William Monroe Trotter House, located east of Central Campus, is a multicultural student center operated by the university's Office of Multi-Ethnic Student Affairs.[193] The University Activities Center (UAC) is a student-run programming organization and is composed of 14 committees.[194] Each group involves students in the planning and execution of a variety of events both on and off campus.\n\n\n\n![](image)Delta Sigma Delta, the first dental fraternity in the world\nThe Michigan Marching Band, composed of more than 350 students from almost all of U-M's schools,[195] is the university's marching band. Over 125 years old (with a first performance in 1897),[196] the band performs at every home football game and travels to at least one away game a year. The student-run and led University of Michigan Pops Orchestra is another musical ensemble that attracts students from all academic backgrounds. It performs regularly in the Michigan Theater. The University of Michigan Men's Glee Club, founded in 1859 and the second oldest such group in the country, is a men's chorus with over 100 members.[197] Its eight-member subset a cappella group, the University of Michigan Friars, which was founded in 1955, is the oldest currently running *a cappella* group on campus.[198] The University of Michigan is also home to over twenty other a cappella groups, including Amazin' Blue, The Michigan G-Men, and Compulsive Lyres, all of which have competed at the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella (ICCA) finals in New York City. Compulsive Lyres are the first and only group from Michigan to claim an ICCA title, having won in 2002.[199] The Michigan G-Men are one of only six groups in the country to compete at ICCA finals four times, one of only two TTBB ensembles to do so, and placed third at the competition in 2015.[200] Amazin' Blue placed fourth at ICCA finals in 2017. In 2020, The A Cappella Archive ranked The Michigan G-Men and Amazin' Blue at #7 and #13, respectively, out of all groups that have ever competed in ICCA.[201]\n\n\n\n![](image)Phi Delta Phi, the oldest legal organization in continuous existence in the United States.\nNational honor societies such as Phi Beta Kappa, Phi Kappa Phi, and Tau Beta Pi have chapters at U-M.[202] Degrees \"with Highest Distinction\" are recommended to students who rank in the top 3% of their class, \"with High Distinction\" to the next 7%, and \"with Distinction\" to the next 15%. Students earning a minimum overall GPA of 3.4 who have demonstrated high academic achievement and capacity for independent work may be recommended for a degree \"with Highest Honors\", \"with High Honors\", or \"with Honors.\"[202] Those students who earn all A's for two or more consecutive terms in a calendar year are recognized as James B. Angell Scholars and are invited to attend the annual Honors Convocation, an event which recognizes undergraduate students with distinguished academic achievements.[202]\n\n\n\n![](image)The archway to the Law Quadrangle\nThe University of Michigan has over 380 cultural and ethnic student organizations on campus.[203] There are organizations for almost every culture from the Arab Student Association to Persian Student Association[204] to African Students Association[205] to even the Egyptian Student Association.[206] These organizations hope to promote various aspects of their culture along with raising political and social awareness around campus by hosting an assortment of events throughout the school year. These clubs also help students make this large University into a smaller community to help find people with similar interests and backgrounds.\n\n\n\n### Collegiate secret societies[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Michigan hosts three secret societies: Michigauma, Adara, and the Vulcans. Michigauma and Adara were once under the umbrella group \"The Tower Society\", the name referring to their historical locations in the Michigan Union tower. Michigauma was all-male while Adara was all-female, although both later became co-ed.\n\n\n\n* Michigauma, more recently known as the Order of Angell, was formed in 1902 by a group of seniors in coordination with University president James Burrill Angell. The group disbanded itself in 2021 due to public concerns about elitism and the society's history. The group was granted a lease for the top floor of the Michigan Union tower in 1932, which they referred to as the \"tomb,\" but the society vacated the space in 2000. Until more recent reforms, the group's rituals were inspired by the culture of Native Americans.[207] Some factions on campus identified Michigauma as a secret society, but many disputed that characterization, as its member list has been published some years in *The Michigan Daily* and the *Michiganensian*, and online since 2006 reforms.\n* Adara, known as Phoenix, was formed in the late 1970s by women leaders on campus and disbanded itself in 2021 amid campus criticisms of secret societies.[208] In the early 1980s they joined the tower society and occupied the sixth floor of the tower just below Michigamua.\n* Vulcans, occupied the fifth floor of the Union tower though were not formally a part of the tower society. They draw their heritage from the Roman god Vulcan. The group which used to do its tapping publicly is known for its long black robes and for its financial contributions of the College of Engineering.\n\n\n### Media and publications[edit]\n\n\nSeveral academic journals are published at the university:\n\n\n\n* The Law School publishes *Michigan Law Review* and six other law journals: The *Michigan Journal of Environmental and Administrative Law*, *University of Michigan Journal of Law Reform*, *Michigan Journal of Race & Law*, *Michigan Telecommunications and Technology Law Review*, *Michigan Journal of International Law*, and *Michigan Journal of Gender and Law*.[209]\n* The Ross School of Business publishes the *Michigan Journal of Business*.\n* Several undergraduate journals are also published at the university, including the *Michigan Journal of Political Science*, *Michigan Journal of History*, *University of Michigan Undergraduate Research Journal*, the *Michigan Journal of International Affairs*, and the *Michigan Journal of Asian Studies*.\n\n\nThe student newspaper is *The Michigan Daily*, founded in 1890 and editorially and financially independent of the university. *The Daily* is published five days a week during academic year, and weekly from May to August. The yearbook is the *Michiganensian*, founded in 1896. Other student publications at the university include the conservative *The Michigan Review* and the progressive *Michigan Independent*. The humor publication *Gargoyle Humor Magazine* is also published by Michigan students.\n\n\nWCBN-FM (88.3 FM) is the student-run college radio station which plays in freeform format. WOLV-TV is the student-run television station that is primarily shown on the university's cable television system. WJJX was previously the school's student-run radio station. A carrier current station, it was launched in 1953.[210]\n\n\n\n### Safety[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Michigan Division of Public Safety and Security (DPSS) is responsible for law enforcement and safety on the main campus. The Division of Public Safety leadership team is made up of one executive director, three division deputy directors, three police chiefs and four directors. In addition, the team is also joined by two program managers and an executive assistant.[211]\n\n\nThe University of Michigan Police Department (UMPD) is a full-service community-oriented law enforcement agency under the DPSS. Its police officers are licensed by the Michigan Commission on Law Enforcement Standards (MCOLES), and have full authority to investigate, search, arrest and use reasonable force, if necessary, to protect people and property under Michigan law and the U-M Regents' Ordinance.[212] The Special Victims Unit (SVU) of the U-M Police Department (UMPD) assists those who have experienced interpersonal violence, such as sexual assault, intimate partner violence, dating violence, stalking or child abuse.[213]\n\n\nViolent crime is rare on the campus though a few of the cases have been notorious including Theodore Kaczynski's attempted murder of professor James V. McConnell and research assistant Nicklaus Suino in 1985. Kaczynski, also known as the Unabomber, graduated from Michigan with his PhD in 1967.\n\n\nA radical left-wing militant organization Weather Underground was founded at the university in 1969.[214] It was later designated a domestic terrorist group by the FBI.[215]\n\n\nIn 2014, the University of Michigan was named one of 55 higher education institutions under investigation by the Office of Civil Rights \"for possible violations of federal law over the handling of sexual violence and harassment complaints.\" President Barack Obama's White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault was organized for such investigations.[216] Seven years later, in 2021, the university attracted national attention when a report commissioned by the university was released that detailed an investigation into sexual assault allegations against doctor Robert Anderson who reportedly abused at least 950 university students, many of whom were athletes, from 1966 to 2003.[217] Several football players from that time say legendary football coach Bo Schembechler ignored and enabled the abuse and told players to \"toughen up\" after being molested.[218] Schembechler reportedly punched his then 10-year-old son Matthew after he reported abuse by Anderson.[219] Following the exposure of a similar history of abuse at Ohio State University, male survivors of both Anderson at Michigan and Strauss at Ohio State spoke out to combat sexual abuse.[220] The University of Michigan settled with the survivors for $490 million.[221]\n\n\n\n## Athletics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Michigan Wolverines\n\n![](image)Burgee of University of Michigan\nThe University of Michigan's sports teams are called the Wolverines. They participate in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision and in the Big Ten Conference in all sports except women's water polo, which is a member of the Collegiate Water Polo Association. U-M boasts 27 varsity sports, including 13 men's teams and 14 women's teams.[222] In 10 of the past 14 years concluding in 2009, U-M has finished in the top five of the NACDA Director's Cup, a ranking compiled by the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics to tabulate the success of universities in competitive sports. U-M has finished in the top 10 of the Directors' Cup standings in 21 of the award's 29 seasons between 1993-2021 and has placed in the top six in nine of the last 10 seasons.[223]\n\n\nMore than 250 Michigan athletes or coaches have participated in Olympic events,[224] and as of 2021 its students and alumni have won 155 Olympic medals.[225]\n\n\nMichigan Stadium is the largest college football stadium in the nation and one of the largest football-only stadiums in the world, with an official capacity of 107,601[226] (the extra seat is said to be \"reserved\" for Fritz Crisler[227]) though attendanceâfrequently over 111,000 spectatorsâregularly exceeds the official capacity.[228] The NCAA's record-breaking attendance has become commonplace at Michigan Stadium.\n\n\nU-M is also home to 29 men's and women's club sports teams, such as rugby, hockey, volleyball, boxing, soccer, and tennis.\n\n\n\n### National championships[edit]\n\n\nThe Michigan football program ranks first in NCAA history in total wins (989 through the end of the 2022 season) and third among FBS schools in winning percentage (.731).[229][230] The team won the first Rose Bowl game in 1902. U-M had 40 consecutive winning seasons from 1968 to 2007, including consecutive bowl game appearances from 1975 to 2007.[231] The Wolverines have won a record 44 Big Ten championships. The program has 11 national championships, most recently in 1997,[232] and has produced three Heisman Trophy winners: Tom Harmon, Desmond Howard and Charles Woodson.[233]\n\n\nThe men's ice hockey team, which plays at Yost Ice Arena, has won nine national championships.[234]\n\n\nThe men's basketball team, which plays at the Crisler Center, has appeared in five Final Fours and won the national championship in 1989. The program also voluntarily vacated victories from its 1992â1993 and 1995â1999 seasons in which illicit payments to players took place, as well as its 1992 and 1993 Final Four appearances.[235] The men's basketball team has most recently won back-to-back Big Ten Tournament Championships.\n\n\n\n### In the Olympics[edit]\n\n\nThrough the 2012 Summer Olympics, 275 U-M students and coaches had participated in the Olympics, winning medals in each Summer Olympic Games except 1896, and winning gold medals in all but four Olympiads. U-M students/student-coaches (e.g., notably, Michael Phelps) have won a total of 185 Olympic medals: 85 golds, 48 silvers, and 52 bronzes.[236]\n\n\n\n### Fight songs and chants[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Michigan's fight song, \"The Victors\", was written by student Louis Elbel in 1898 following the last-minute football victory over the University of Chicago that won a league championship. The song was declared by John Philip Sousa to be \"the greatest college fight song ever written.\"[237] The song refers to the university as being \"the Champions of the West.\" At the time, U-M was part of the Western Conference, which would later become the Big Ten Conference. Michigan was considered to be on the Western Frontier when it was founded in the old Northwest Territory.\n\n\nAlthough mainly used at sporting events, the Michigan fight song is often heard at other events as well. President Gerald Ford had it played by the United States Marine Band as his entrance anthem during his term as president from 1974 to 1977, in preference over the more traditional \"Hail to the Chief\",[238] and the Michigan Marching Band performed a slow-tempo variation of the fight song at his funeral.[239] The fight song is also sung during graduation commencement ceremonies. The university's alma mater song is \"The Yellow and Blue.\" A common rally cry is \"Let's Go Blue!\" which has a complementary short musical arrangement written by former students Joseph Carl, a sousaphonist, and Albert Ahronheim, a drum major.[240]\n\n\nBefore \"The Victors\" was officially the university's fight song, the song \"There'll Be a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight\" was considered to be the school song.[241] After Michigan temporarily withdrew from the Western Conference in 1907, a new Michigan fight song \"Varsity\" was written in 1911 because the line \"champions of the West\" was no longer appropriate.[242]\n\n\n\n## Museums[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of museums and collections at the University of Michigan.\n\n![](image)Newberry Hall (Kelsey Museum of Archeology)\nThe university is also home to several public and research museums including but not limited to the University Museum of Art, University of Michigan Museum of Natural History, Detroit Observatory, Sindecuse Museum of Dentistry, and the LSA Museum of Anthropological Archaeology.\n\n\nKelsey Museum of Archeology has a collection of Roman, Greek, Egyptian, and Middle Eastern artifacts.[243] Between 1972 and 1974, the museum was involved in the excavation of the archaeological site of Dibsi Faraj in northern Syria.[244] The Kelsey Museum re-opened November 1, 2009 after a renovation and expansion.[245]\n\n\nThe collection of the University of Michigan Museum of Art include nearly 19,000 objects that span cultures, eras, and media and include European, American, Middle Eastern, Asian, and African art, as well as changing exhibits. The Museum of Art re-opened in 2009 after a three-year renovation and expansion.[246] UMMA presents special exhibitions and diverse educational programs featuring the visual, performing, film and literary arts that contextualize the gallery experience.[247]\n\n\nThe University of Michigan Museum of Natural History began in the mid-19th century and expanded greatly with the donation of 60,000 specimens by Joseph Beal Steere in the 1870s. The building also houses three research museums: the Museum of Anthropology, Museum of Paleontology. Today, the collections are primarily housed and displayed in the Ruthven Museums Building which was completed in 1928.[248]\n\n\n\n## Notable alumni[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of University of Michigan alumni.\n\nIn addition to U.S. President Gerald Ford, who played on the university's football team, the university is, as of 2020,[update] associated with thirty-four Pulitzer Prize winners, twenty-seven Rhodes Scholars,[249] one Mitchell Scholar,[250] and ten Nobel laureates. As of 2012[update], the university had almost 500,000 living alumni.[251]\n\n\nMore than 250 Michigan graduates have served as legislators as either a United States Senator (47 graduates) or as a Congressional representative (over 215 graduates), including former House Majority Leader Dick Gephardt[252] and U.S. Representative Justin Amash, who represented Michigan's Third Congressional District.[253] Mike Duggan, Mayor of Detroit, earned his bachelor's degree and J.D. degree at Michigan, while the former Michigan Governor Rick Snyder earned his bachelor, M.B.A., and J.D. degrees from Michigan. Former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson received his medical degree from the U-M medical school. Thomas E. Dewey, another Michigan alumnus, was the Governor of New York from 1943 to 1954 and was the Republican Party's presidential nominee in the 1944 and 1948 presidential elections. The 13th President of Pakistan, Arif Alvi, completed his master's degree in prosthodontics in 1975.\n\n\n\n* ![Clarence Darrow Lawyer (1878, Law)](image)\n\nClarence Darrow  \nLawyer  \n(1878, Law)\n* ![Frank Murphy Supreme Court Justice (1914, Law)](image)\n\nFrank Murphy  \nSupreme Court Justice  \n(1914, Law)\n* ![Arleigh Burke Admiral, namesake of destroyer class (1931, MS)](image)\n\nArleigh Burke  \nAdmiral, namesake of destroyer class  \n(1931, MS)\n* ![Gerald Ford President (1935, BA)](image)\n\nGerald Ford  \nPresident  \n(1935, BA)\n* ![Raoul Wallenberg Diplomat and humanitarian (1935, BA)](image)\n\nRaoul Wallenberg  \nDiplomat and humanitarian  \n(1935, BA)\n* ![Arthur Miller Playwright (1938, BA)](image)\n\nArthur Miller  \nPlaywright  \n(1938, BA)\n* ![Mike Wallace Journalist (1939, BA)](image)\n\nMike Wallace  \nJournalist  \n(1939, BA)\n* ![James Earl Jones Actor (1955, BA)](image)\n\nJames Earl Jones  \nActor  \n(1955, BA)\n* ![James Irwin Astronaut, co-founder of UM Club of the Moon (1957, MS)](image)\n\nJames Irwin  \nAstronaut, co-founder of UM Club of the Moon (1957, MS)\n* ![Jessye Norman Opera singer (1968, MA)](image)\n\nJessye Norman  \nOpera singer  \n(1968, MA)\n* ![Lawrence Kasdan Filmmaker (1971, M.Ed.)](image)\n\nLawrence Kasdan  \nFilmmaker  \n(1971, M.Ed.)\n* ![Eugene Robinson Columnist (1974, BA)](image)\n\nEugene Robinson  \nColumnist  \n(1974, BA)\n* ![Edmund White Author (1962, BA)](image)\n\nEdmund White  \nAuthor  \n(1962, BA)\n* Madonna Entertainer (No degree)\n\nMadonna  \nEntertainer  \n(No degree)\n* ![Larry Page Co-founder of Google (1995, BS)](image)\n\nLarry Page  \nCo-founder of Google  \n(1995, BS)\n* ![Tom Brady Football player (1999, BGS)](image)\n\nTom Brady  \nFootball player  \n(1999, BGS)\n* ![Michael Phelps Olympic swimmer (No degree)](image)\n\nMichael Phelps  \nOlympic swimmer  \n(No degree)\n\n\nU-M's contributions to aeronautics include aircraft designer Clarence \"Kelly\" Johnson of Lockheed Skunk Works fame,[254] Lockheed president Willis Hawkins, and several astronauts including the all-U-M crews of both Gemini 4[255] and Apollo 15.[256]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nRobert E. Park\n![](image)\nAlice Hamilton (MD, 1893)\n![](image)\nClaude Shannon (BA, BSEE)\n\nNumerous U-M graduates contributed to the field of computer science, including Claude Shannon (who made major contributions to the mathematics of information theory),[257] and Turing Award winners Edgar Codd, Stephen Cook, Frances E. Allen and Michael Stonebraker. U-M also counts among its alumni nearly two dozen billionaires, including prominent tech-company founders and co-founders such as J. Robert Beyster, who founded Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) in 1969[258] and Google co-founder Larry Page.[259]\n\n\n\n![](image)Alice Freeman Palmer (BA, 1876, PhD Hon, 1882)\nBy 1900, nearly 150 women had received advanced degrees from U-M.[260] Sarah Dix Hamlin was the first female student accepted to the University of Michigan. She graduated in 1874.[261] Marjorie Lee Browne received her M.S. in 1939 and her doctoral degree in 1950, becoming the third African American woman to earn a PhD in mathematics.[262][263] Many, however, were forced to leave the university to continue their studies or to become faculty in their own right elsewhere, like Katharine Comanâwhen U-M President James Angell offered her a \"Dean of Women\" position, she told him that \"'if the regents...wish to propose a chaperone for students, and propose to dignify that office by allowing the woman who holds it to do a little University teaching,' she was not interested. If, however, the regents accepted women as equal partners and as faculty, and if she were one of several women given proper rank and authority, she would consider it.\"[260] Michigan's Regents did not accept, so instead Coman became dean, founder of the Economics Department, and the first female statistics professor in the US at Wellesley College.[264]:â15\n\n\nNotable writers who attended U-M include playwright Arthur Miller,[252] essayists Susan Orlean,[252] Jia Tolentino,[265] Sven Birkerts, journalists and editors Mike Wallace,[252] Jonathan Chait of *The New Republic*, Indian author and columnist Anees Jung, Daniel Okrent,[252] and Sandra Steingraber, food critics Ruth Reichl and Gael Greene, novelists Brett Ellen Block, Elizabeth Kostova, Marge Piercy,[252] Brad Meltzer,[252] Betty Smith,[252] and Charles Major, screenwriter Judith Guest,[252] Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Theodore Roethke, National Book Award winners Keith Waldrop and Jesmyn Ward, composer/author/puppeteer Forman Brown, Alireza Jafarzadeh (a Middle East analyst, author, and TV commentator), and memoirist and self-help book author Jerry Newport.\n\n\nIn Hollywood, famous alumni include actors Michael Dunn,[252] Darren Criss, James Earl Jones,[252] David Alan Grier,[252] actresses Lucy Liu,[252] Gilda Radner,[252] and Selma Blair,[252] television director Mark Cendrowski, and filmmaker Lawrence Kasdan.[252] Many Broadway and musical theatre actors, including Gavin Creel,[252] Andrew Keenan-Bolger, his sister Celia Keenan-Bolger, and Taylor Louderman attended U-M for musical theatre. The musical theatre group StarKid Productions had their start at the university, and staged multiple productions there.[266]\n\n\nMusical graduates include operatic soprano Jessye Norman,[252] singer Joe Dassin, multiple members of the band Tally Hall, jazz guitarist Randy Napoleon, and Mannheim Steamroller founder Chip Davis.[252] Well-known composers who are alumni include Frank Ticheli, Andrew Lippa, and the Oscar and Tony Award-winning duo Benj Pasek and Justin Paul. Pop superstar Madonna[252] and rock legend Iggy Pop,[252] attended but did not graduate.\n\n\n\n![](image)14th President of Yale University James Rowland Angell, an early proponent of eugenics, graduated from Michigan in 1890. His father, James Burrill Angell, was President of the University of Michigan from 1871 to 1909.\nOther U-M graduates include former Dean of Harvard Law School Martha Minow, Dean of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania Erika H. James, current Dean of Yale Law School, Heather Gerken, assisted-suicide advocate Jack Kevorkian,[252] Weather Underground radical activist Bill Ayers,[267] activist Tom Hayden,[252] architect Charles Moore,[268] the Swedish Holocaust hero Raoul Wallenberg,[269] and Civil War General Benjamin D. Pritchard.[270] Neurosurgeon and CNN chief medical correspondent Sanjay Gupta attended both college and medical school at the university.[271] Clarence Darrow attended law school at U-M at a time when many lawyers did not receive any formal education.[252] Frank Murphy, who was mayor of Detroit, governor of Michigan, attorney general of the United States, and Supreme Court justice was also a graduate of the Law School.[252] Conservative pundit Ann Coulter is another U-M law school graduate (J.D. 1988).[252]\n\n\nVaughn R. Walker, a federal district judge in California who overturned the controversial California Proposition 8 in 2010 and ruled it unconstitutional, received his undergraduate degree from U-M in 1966.[272]\n\n\nKenneth Marin, who became a professor of economics after he graduated from the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, was appointed by President Lyndon B. Johnson as a member of the White House Consumer Advisory Council where he served on Wage and Price Control in the mid-1960s. He went to Tanzania in the late sixties and worked as an economic advisor to the government of President Julius Nyerere until the early 1970s.\n\n\nU-M athletes have starred in Major League Baseball, the National Football League and National Basketball Association as well as other professional sports. Notable among recent players is Tom Brady of the New England Patriots and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.[252] Three players have won college football's Heisman Trophy, awarded to the player considered the best in the nation: Tom Harmon (1940), Desmond Howard (1991) and Charles Woodson (1997).[233] Professional golfer John Schroeder and Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps also attended the University of Michigan, with the latter studying Sports Marketing and Management. Phelps also swam competitively for Club Wolverine, a swimming club associated with the university.[273] National Hockey League players Marty Turco, Luke Hughes, Chris Summers, Max Pacioretty, Carl Hagelin, Dylan Larkin, Zach Hyman, Brendan Morrison,[252] Jack Johnson, and Michael Cammalleri[252] all played for U-M's ice hockey team. Baseball Hall of Famers George Sisler and Barry Larkin also played baseball at the university.[252] Several team owners have also been alumni, including multiple-team owner Bill Davidson (NBA Detroit Pistons, NHL Tampa Bay Lightning, WNBA Detroit Shock, among others) and NFL owners Stephen M. Ross (Miami Dolphins), Preston Robert Tisch (New York Giants), and Ralph Wilson (Buffalo Bills).\n\n\nThe university claims the only alumni association with a chapter on the Moon, established in 1971 when the crew of Apollo 15 (two of whom had engineering degrees from U-M; the third had attended for a year before transferring[256]) placed a charter plaque for a new U-M Alumni Association on the lunar surface.[252] The plaque states: \"The Alumni Association of The University of Michigan. Charter Number 1. This is to certify that The University of Michigan Club of The Moon is a duly constituted unit of the Alumni Association and entitled to all the rights and privileges under the Association's Constitution.\" Several small U-M flags were also brought on the mission; a persistent campus legend claims at least one flag was left on the Moon.[256]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Other consists of Multiracial Americans & those who prefer to not say.\n2. **^** The percentage of students who received an income-based federal Pell grant intended for low-income students.\n3. **^** The percentage of students who are a part of the American middle class at the bare minimum.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"U-M's Foundings in Detroit and Ann Arbor: Key Dates\".

Headquartered in Oakland, the system is composed of its ten campuses at Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, Merced, Riverside, San Diego, San Francisco, Santa Barbara, and Santa Cruz, along with numerous research centers and academic abroad centers.[5] The system is the state's land-grant university.[6] Major publications generally rank most UC campuses as being among the best universities in the world. In 1900, UC was one of the founders of the Association of American Universities and since the 1970s seven of its campuses, in addition to Berkeley, have been admitted to the association. Berkeley, Davis, Santa Cruz, Irvine, Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, and San Diego are considered Public Ivies, making California the state with the most universities in the nation to hold the title.[7][8] UC campuses have large numbers of distinguished faculty in almost every academic discipline, with UC faculty and researchers having won 71 Nobel Prizes as of 2021.[9]\n\n\nThe system's ten campuses have a combined student body of 294,309 students, 24,800 faculty members, 167,300 staff members and over two million living alumni.[2] Its newest campus in Merced opened in fall 2005. Nine campuses enroll both undergraduate and graduate students; one campus, UC San Francisco, enrolls only graduate and professional students in the medical and health sciences. In addition, the University of California College of the Law located in San Francisco, is legally affiliated with UC and shares its name but is otherwise autonomous. Under the California Master Plan for Higher Education, the University of California is a part of the state's three-system public higher education plan, which also includes the California State University system and the California Community Colleges system. UC is governed by a Board of Regents whose autonomy from the rest of the state government is protected by the state constitution.[10] The University of California also manages or co-manages three national laboratories for the U.S. Department of Energy: Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), and Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL).[11]\n\n\nThe University of California was founded on March 23, 1868, and operated in Oakland, where it absorbed the assets of the College of California before moving to Berkeley in 1873.[12][13] It also affiliated with independent medical and law schools in San Francisco. Over the next eight decades, several branch locations and satellite programs were established across the state. In March 1951, the University of California began to reorganize itself into something distinct from its campus in Berkeley, with UC President Robert Gordon Sproul staying in place as chief executive of the UC system, while Clark Kerr became Berkeley's first chancellor[14][15][16][17] and Raymond B. Allen became the first chancellor of UCLA.[18] However, the 1951 reorganization was stalled by resistance from Sproul and his allies,[19] and it was not until Kerr succeeded Sproul as UC president that UC was able to evolve into a university system from 1957 to 1960.[20] At that time, chancellors were appointed for additional campuses and each was granted some degree of greater autonomy.[21]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)In November 1857, the College of California's trustees began to acquire various parcels of land facing the Golden Gate in what is now Berkeley.\nIn 1849, the state of California ratified its first constitution, which contained the express objective of creating a complete educational system including a state university.[22] Taking advantage of the Morrill Land-Grant Acts, the California State Legislature established an Agricultural, Mining, and Mechanical Arts College in 1866.[23][24] However, it existed only on paper, as a placeholder to secure federal land-grant funds.[24]\n\n\nMeanwhile, Congregational minister Henry Durant, an alumnus of Yale, had established the private Contra Costa Academy, on June 20, 1853, in Oakland, California.[23] The initial site was bounded by Twelfth and Fourteenth Streets and Harrison and Franklin Streets in downtown Oakland[23] (and is marked today by State Historical Plaque No. 45 at the northeast corner of Thirteenth and Franklin). In turn, the academy's trustees were granted a charter in 1855 for a College of California, though the college continued to operate as a college preparatory school until it added college-level courses in 1860.[23][24] The college's trustees, educators, and supporters believed in the importance of a liberal arts education (especially the study of the Greek and Roman classics), but ran into a lack of interest in liberal arts colleges on the American frontier (as a true college, the college was graduating only three or four students per year).[24]\n\n\n\n![](image)South Hall, built in 1873, is the oldest building on the Berkeley campus.\nIn November 1857, the college's trustees began to acquire various parcels of land facing the Golden Gate in what is now Berkeley for a future planned campus to the north of Oakland.[23] But first, they needed to secure the college's water rights by buying a large farm to the east.[23] In 1864, they organized the College Homestead Association, which borrowed $35,000 to purchase the land, plus another $33,000 to purchase 160 acres (650,000 m2) of land to the south of the future campus.[25] The association subdivided the latter parcel and started selling lots with the hope it could raise enough money to repay its lenders and also create a new college town.[23] But sales of new homesteads fell short.[23]\n\n\nGovernor Frederick Low favored the establishment of a state university based upon the University of Michigan plan, and thus in one sense may be regarded as the founder of the University of California.[23][24] At the College of California's 1867 commencement exercises, where Low was present, Yale University professor Benjamin Silliman Jr. criticized the 1866 California law for establishing a polytechnic school, instead of a real university.[23][24] That same day, Low reportedly first suggested a merger of the already-functional College of California (which had land, buildings, faculty, and students, but not enough money) with the nonfunctional state college (which had money and nothing else), and went on to participate in the ensuing negotiations.[23][24]\n\n\n\n![](image)UC San Francisco campus in 1908.\nOn October 9, 1867, the college's trustees reluctantly agreed to join forces with the state college to their mutual advantage, but under one conditionâthat there not be simply an \"Agricultural, Mining, and Mechanical Arts College\", but a complete university, within which the assets of the College of California would be used to create a College of Letters (now known as the College of Letters and Science).[23][24][26] Accordingly, the Organic Act, establishing the University of California, was introduced as a bill by Assemblyman John W. Dwinelle on March 5, 1868, and after it was duly passed by both houses of the state legislature, it was signed into state law by Governor Henry H. Haight (Low's successor) on March 23, 1868.[23][24][27] However, as legally constituted, the new university was *not* an actual merger of the two colleges, but was an entirely new institution which merely inherited certain objectives and assets from each of them.[28] The University of California's second president, Daniel Coit Gilman, opened its new campus in Berkeley in September 1873.[29]\n\n\n\n### UC affiliates[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Citrus Experiment Station, built in 1917, is the oldest building on the UC Riverside campus.\nSection 8 of the Organic Act authorized the Board of Regents to affiliate the University of California with independent self-sustaining professional colleges.[30][31] \"Affiliation\" meant UC and its affiliates would \"share the risk in launching new endeavors in education\".[30] The affiliates shared the prestige of the state university's brand, and UC agreed to award degrees in its own name to their graduates on the recommendation of their respective faculties, but the affiliates were otherwise managed independently by their own boards of trustees, charged their own tuition and fees, and maintained their own budgets separate from the UC budget.[30] It was through the process of affiliation that UC was able to claim it had medical and law schools in San Francisco within a decade of its founding.[30]\n\n\nIn 1879, California adopted its second and current constitution, which included unusually strong language to ensure UC's independence from the rest of the state government.[10][32] This had lasting consequences for the Hastings College of the Law, which had been separately chartered and affiliated in 1878 by an act of the state legislature at the behest of founder Serranus Clinton Hastings.[33] After a falling out with his own handpicked board of directors, the founder persuaded the state legislature in 1883 and 1885 to pass new laws to place his law school under the direct control of the Board of Regents.[34] In 1886, the Supreme Court of California declared those newer acts to be unconstitutional because the clause protecting UC's independence in the 1879 state constitution had stripped the state legislature of the ability to amend the 1878 act.[35][36] To this day, the Hastings College of the Law remains an affiliate of UC, maintains its own board of directors, and is not governed by the regents.[30][35]\n\n\n\n![](image)Hart Hall, built in 1928, is the oldest building on the UC Davis campus.\nIn contrast, Toland Medical College (founded in 1864 and affiliated in 1873) and later, the dental, pharmacy, and nursing schools in San Francisco were affiliated with UC through written agreements, and not statutes invested with constitutional importance by court decisions.[30] In the early 20th century, the Affiliated Colleges (as they came to be called) began to agree to submit to the regents' governance during the term of President Benjamin Ide Wheeler, as the Board of Regents had come to recognize the problems inherent in the existence of independent entities that shared the UC brand but over which UC had no real control.[30] While Hastings remained independent, the Affiliated Colleges were able to increasingly coordinate their operations with one another under the supervision of the UC president and regents, and evolved into the health sciences campus known today as the University of California, San Francisco.[30]\n\n\n\n### North-south tensions and decentralization[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Powell Library, built in 1929, is one of the four oldest buildings on the UCLA campus.\nIn August 1882, the California State Normal School (whose original normal school in San Jose is now San Jose State University) opened a second school in Los Angeles to train teachers for the growing population of Southern California.[37] In 1887, the Los Angeles school was granted its own board of trustees independent of the San Jose school, and in 1919, the state legislature transferred it to UC control and renamed it the Southern Branch of the University of California.[38] In 1927, it became the University of California at Los Angeles; the \"at\" would be replaced with a comma in 1958.[39]\n\n\nLos Angeles surpassed San Francisco in the 1920 census to become the most populous metropolis in California. Because Los Angeles had become the state government's single largest source of both tax revenue and votes, its residents felt entitled to demand more prestige and autonomy for their campus. Their efforts bore fruit in March 1951, when UCLA became the first UC site outside of Berkeley to achieve *de jure* coequal status with the Berkeley campus. That month, the regents approved a reorganization plan under which both the Berkeley and Los Angeles campuses would be supervised by chancellors reporting to the UC president.[14][15][16][40] However, the 1951 plan was severely flawed; it was overly vague about how the chancellors were to become the \"executive heads\" of their campuses. Due to stubborn resistance from President Sproul and several vice presidents and deansâwho simply carried on as beforeâthe chancellors ended up as glorified provosts with limited control over academic affairs and long-range planning while the president and the regents retained *de facto* control over everything else.[19]\n\n\n\n![](image)UC Irvine was founded and had its campus built out in the 1960s.\nUpon becoming president in October 1957, Clark Kerr supervised UC's rapid transformation into a true public university system through a series of proposals adopted unanimously by the regents from 1957 to 1960.[20][21] Kerr's reforms included expressly granting all campus chancellors the full range of executive powers, privileges, and responsibilities which Sproul had denied to Kerr himself, as well as the radical decentralization of a tightly knit bureaucracy in which all lines of authority had always run directly to the president at Berkeley or to the regents themselves.[20][21][40] In 1965, UCLA Chancellor Franklin D. Murphy tried to push this to what he saw as its logical conclusion: he advocated for authorizing all chancellors to report directly to the Board of Regents, thereby rendering the UC president redundant.[41] Murphy wanted to transform UC from one federated university into a confederation of independent universities, similar to the situation in Kansas (from where he was recruited).[41] Murphy was unable to develop any support for his proposal, Kerr quickly put down what he thought of as \"Murphy's rebellion\", and therefore Kerr's vision of UC as a university system prevailed: \"one university with pluralistic decision-making\".[41]\n\n\n\n![](image)Geisel Library, at UC San Diego, was built in 1970.\nDuring the 20th century, UC acquired additional satellite locations which, like Los Angeles, were all subordinate to administrators at the Berkeley campus. California farmers lobbied for UC to perform applied research responsive to their immediate needs; in 1905, the Legislature established a \"University Farm School\" at Davis and in 1907 a \"Citrus Experiment Station\" at Riverside as adjuncts to the College of Agriculture at Berkeley. In 1912, UC acquired a private oceanography laboratory in San Diego, which had been founded nine years earlier by local business promoters working with a Berkeley professor. In 1944, UC acquired Santa Barbara State College from the California State Colleges, the descendants of the State Normal Schools.[42] In 1958, the regents began promoting these locations to general campuses, thereby creating UCSB (1958), UC Davis (1959), UC Riverside (1959), UC San Diego (1960), and UCSF (1964).[43][44] Each campus was also granted the right to have its own chancellor upon promotion. In response to California's continued population growth, UC opened two additional general campuses in 1965, with UC Irvine opening in Irvine and UC Santa Cruz opening in Santa Cruz.[43] The youngest campus, UC Merced opened in fall 2005 to serve the San Joaquin Valley.\n\n\n\n![](image)UC Santa Cruz, founded in 1965.\nAfter losing campuses in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara to the University of California system, supporters of the California State College system arranged for the state constitution to be amended in 1946 to prevent similar losses from happening again in the future.[42]\n\n\nWith decentralization complete, it was decided in 1986 that the UC president should no longer be based at the Berkeley campus, and the UC Office of the President moved to Kaiser Center in Oakland in 1989.[45] That lakefront location was subject to widespread criticism as \"too elegant and too corporate for a public university\".[46] In 1998, the Office of the President moved again, to a newly constructed but much more modest building near the former site of the College of California in Oakland.[47]\n\n\n\n### Modern history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)UC Merced, founded in 2005.\nThe California Master Plan for Higher Education of 1960 established that UC must admit undergraduates from the top 12.5% (one-eighth) of graduating high school seniors in California. Prior to the promulgation of the Master Plan, UC was to admit undergraduates from the top 15%. UC does not currently adhere to all tenets of the original Master Plan, such as the directives that no campus was to exceed total enrollment of 27,500 students (in order to ensure quality) and that public higher education should be tuition-free for California residents. Five campuses, Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, and San Diego, each have current total enrollment at over 30,000, and of these five, all but Irvine have undergraduate enrollments over 30,000.[3]\n\n\nAfter the state electorate severely limited long-term property tax revenue by enacting Proposition 13 in 1978, UC was forced to make up for the resulting collapse in state financial support by imposing a variety of fees which were tuition in all but name.[48][49][50] On November 18, 2010, the regents finally gave up on the longstanding legal fiction that UC does not charge tuition by renaming the Educational Fee to \"Tuition\".[51] As part of its search for funds during the 2000s and 2010s, UC quietly began to admit higher percentages of highly accomplished (and more lucrative) students from other states and countries,[52] but was forced to reverse course in 2015 in response to the inevitable public outcry and start admitting more California residents.[53][54]\n\n\nOn November 14, 2022, about 48,000 academic workers at all regent-governed UC campuses, as well as the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, went on strike for higher pay and benefits as authorized by the United Auto Workers (UAW) union.[55] UAW has cited more than 20 unfair labor practice charges performed by UC, including unilateral changes in policy and obstructing worker negotiation.[56] The strike lasted almost six weeks, officially ending on December 23.[57]\n\n\n\n## Governance[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Office of the President of the University of California, in Oakland\nAll University of California campuses except Hastings College of the Law are governed by the Regents of the University of California as required by the Constitution of the State of California.[32] Eighteen regents are appointed by the governor for 12-year terms.[32] One member is a student appointed for a one-year term.[32] There are also seven *ex officio* membersâthe governor, lieutenant governor, speaker of the State Assembly, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, president and vice president of the alumni associations of UC, and the UC president.[32] The Academic Senate, made up of faculty members, is empowered by the regents to set academic policies.[32] In addition, the system-wide faculty chair and vice-chair sit on the Board of Regents as non-voting members.[32]\n\n\n\n### President of the University of California[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Blake House and Gardens, built by architect Walter Danforth Bliss in 1924, served as the official residence of the UC President, from 1967 until 2008, when it was opened to the public.\nOriginally, the president was the chief executive of the first campus, Berkeley. In turn, other UC locations (with the exception of Hastings College of the Law) were treated as off-site departments of the Berkeley campus, and were headed by provosts who were subordinate to the president. In March 1951, the regents reorganized the university's governing structure. Starting with the 1952â53 academic year, day-to-day \"chief executive officer\" functions for the Berkeley and Los Angeles campuses were transferred to chancellors who were vested with a high degree of autonomy, and reported as equals to UC's president.[14][15][16] As noted above, the regents promoted five additional UC locations to campuses and allowed them to have chancellors of their own in a series of decisions from 1958 to 1964,[43] and the three campuses added since then have also been run by chancellors. In turn, all chancellors (again, with the exception of Hastings) report as equals to the University of California President. Today, the UC Office of the President (UCOP) and the Office of the Secretary and Chief of Staff to the Regents of the University of California share an office building in downtown Oakland that serves as the UC system's headquarters.[58]\n\n\nKerr's vision for UC governance was \"one university with pluralistic decision-making\".[59] In other words, the internal delegation of operational authority to chancellors at the campus level and allowing nine other campuses to become separate centers of academic life independent of Berkeley did not change the fact that all campuses remain part of one legal entity. As a 1968 UC centennial coffee table book explained: \"Yet for all its campuses, colleges, schools, institutes, and research stations, it remains one University, under one Board of Regents and one presidentâthe University of California.\"[60] UC continues to take a \"united approach\" as one university in matters in which it inures to UC's advantage to do so, such as when negotiating with the legislature and governor in Sacramento.[59] The University of California continues to manage certain matters at the systemwide level in order to maintain common standards across all campuses, such as student admissions, appointment and promotion of faculty, and approval of academic programs.[61]\n\n\n\nList of presidents\n![](image)Michael V.

Drake\n |\n\n\nAll UC presidents had been white men until 2013, when former Homeland Security Secretary, and Governor of Arizona, Janet Napolitano became the first woman to hold the office of UC President.[62] On July 7, 2020, Dr. Michael V. Drake, a former UC chancellor and medical research professor, was selected as the 21st president of the University of California system, making him the first black president to hold the office in UC's 152-year history. He took office on August 1, 2020.[63]\n\n\n\nOfficial residences\n![](image)University House, Berkeley served as the official residence of the UC President from 1911 until 1958. Today it serves Berkeley's Chancellor.\nBesides substantial six-figure incomes, the UC president and all UC chancellors enjoy controversial perks such as free housing in the form of university-maintained mansions.[64] In 1962, Anson Blake's will donated his 10-acre (40,000Â m2) estate (Blake Garden) and mansion (Blake House) in Kensington to the University of California's Department of Landscape Architecture. In 1968, the regents decided to make Blake House the official residence of the UC president. As of 2005, it cost around $300,000 per year to maintain Blake Garden and Blake House; the latter, built in 1926, is a 13,239-square-foot (1,229.9Â m2) mansion with a view of San Francisco Bay.[64]\n\n\nBlake House has sat vacant since President Dynes departed in 2008, due to the high cost of needed seismic strengthening and renovating its dilapidated interior (estimated at $3.5 million in 2013).[65] From 2008 to 2022, all three UC presidents during that timeframe (i.e., Yudof, Napolitano, and Drake) lived in rented homes.[65] In 2022, UC finally purchased the Selden Williams House, a 6,400-square-foot (590Â m2) house in Berkeley, for $6.5 million to serve as the UC president's official residence.[65] UC had previously owned the same home from 1971 to 1991, when it served as the official residence of the UC vice president.[65] (UC no longer has a single \"vice president\"; the president's direct reports now have titles like \"executive vice president\", \"senior vice president\", or \"vice president\".[66]) \n\n\n\n![](image)Selden Williams House, built in 1928 and designed by architect Julia Morgan, serves as the official residence of the UC President, since 2022.\nAll UC chancellors traditionally live for free in a mansion on or near campus that is usually known as *University House*, where they host social functions attended by guests and donors.[67] Berkeley's University House formerly served as the official residence of the UC president, but is now the official residence of Berkeley's chancellor. UCSD's University House was closed from 2004 to 2014 for $10.5 million in renovations paid for by private donors, which were so expensive because the 12,000-square-foot structure sits on top of a sacred Native American cemetery and next to an unstable coastal bluff.[68][69]\n\n\n\n### Finances[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University of California finances\n\nThe State of California currently (2021â2022) spends $3.467 billion on the UC system, out of total UC operating revenues of $41.6 billion. The \"UC Budget for Current Operations\" lists the medical centers as the largest revenue source, contributing 39% of the budget, the federal government 11%, Core Funds (State General Funds, UC General Funds, student tuition) 21%, private support (gifts, grants, endowments) 7% ,and Sales and Services at 21%. In 1980, the state funded 86.8% of the UC budget.[70] While state funding has somewhat recovered, as of 2019 state support still lags behind even recent historic levels (e.g. 2001) when adjusted for inflation.[70][71]\n\n\nAccording to the California Public Policy Institute, California spends 12% of its General Fund on higher education, but that percentage is divided between the University of California, California State University and California Community Colleges. Over the past forty years, state funding of higher education has dropped from 18% to 12%, resulting in a drop in UC's per student funding from $23,000 in 2016 to a current $8,000 per year per student.[72]\n\n\n\n![](image)View of the UC Office of the President.\nIn May 2004, UC President Robert C. Dynes and CSU Chancellor Charles B. Reed struck a private deal, called the \"Higher Education Compact\", with Governor Schwarzenegger. They agreed to slash spending by about a billion dollars (about a third of the university's core budget for academic operations) in exchange for a funding formula lasting until 2011. The agreement calls for modest annual increases in state funds (but not enough to replace the loss in state funds Dynes and Schwarzenegger agreed to), private fundraising to help pay for basic programs, and large student fee hikes, especially for graduate and professional students. A detailed analysis of the Compact by the Academic Senate \"Futures Report\" indicated, despite the large fee increases, the university core budget did not recover to 2000 levels.[73] Undergraduate student fees have risen 90% from 2003 to 2007.[74] In 2011, for the first time in UC's history, student fees exceeded contributions from the State of California.[75]\n\n\nThe First District Court of Appeal in San Francisco ruled in 2007 that the University of California owed nearly $40 million in refunds to about 40,000 students who were promised that their tuition fees would remain steady, but were hit with increases when the state ran short of money in 2003.[76]\n\n\nIn September 2019, the University of California announced it will divest its $83 billion in endowment and pension funds from the fossil fuel industry, ostensibly to avoid the \"financial risk\" inherent in that industry because of climate change, but also responsive pleas to stop investing in fossil fuel.[77]\n\n\n\n### Criticism[edit]\n\n\nIn 2008, the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, the regional accreditor of the UC schools, criticized the UC system for \"significant problems in governance, leadership and decision making\" and \"confusion about the roles and responsibilities of the university president, the regents and the 10 campus chancellors with no clear lines of authority and boundaries\".[78]\n\n\nIn 2016, university system officials admitted that they monitored all e-mails sent to and from their servers.[79]\n\n\n\n## Campuses and rankings[edit]\n\n\n![A topographic map of California with the UC campuses marked](image)![Berkeley](image)\nBerkeley\n ![San Diego](image)\nSan Diego\n ![Los Angeles](image)\nLos Angeles\n ![Santa Barbara](image)\nSanta Barbara\n ![San Francisco](image)\nSan Francisco\n ![Irvine](image)\nIrvine\n ![Davis](image)\nDavis\n ![Santa Cruz](image)\nSanta Cruz\n ![Riverside](image)\nRiverside\n ![Merced](image)\nMerced\nclass=notpageimage|\nThe ten UC campuses\n\nAt present, the UC system officially describes itself as a \"ten campus\" system consisting of the campuses listed below.[80] These campuses are under the direct control of the regents and president.[81] Only ten campuses are listed on the official UC letterhead.[82]\n\n\nAlthough it shares the name and public status of the UC system, the College of the Law, San Francisco (formerly Hastings College of the Law) is not controlled by the regents or president; it has a separate board of directors and must seek funding directly from the Legislature. However, under the California Education Code, Hastings degrees are awarded in the name of the regents and bear the signature of the UC president.[83] Furthermore, Education Code section 92201 states that Hastings \"is affiliated with the University of California, and is the law department thereof\".[84]\n\n\n\n### University rankings[edit]\n\n\nAnnually, UC campuses are ranked highly by various publications. Six UC campuses rank in the top 50 U.S. National Universities of 2022 by *U.S. News & World Report*, with UCLA, Berkeley, UC Santa Barbara, UC San Diego, UC Irvine, and UC Davis all ranked in the top 50. Four UC campuses also ranked in the top 50 in the *U.S. News & World Report* Best Global Universities Rankings in 2021, namely Berkeley, UCLA, UCSF, and UC San Diego.[85] UCSF is ranked as one of the top universities in biomedicine in the world[86][87][88][89][90][91] and the UCSF School of Medicine is ranked 3rd in the United States among research-oriented medical schools and for primary care by *U.S. News & World Report*.[92]\n\n\nThree UC campuses: Berkeley, UCLA, and UC San Diego all ranked in the top 15 universities in the US according to the 2020 *Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU)* US National University Rankings and also in the top 20 in World University Rankings. The *Academic Ranking of World Universities* also ranked UCSF, UC Davis, UC Irvine, and UC Santa Barbara in the top 50 US National Universities and in the top 100 World Universities in 2020.[93]\n\n\nBerkeley, UCLA, and UC San Diego all ranked in the top 50 universities in the world according to both the *Times Higher Education World University Rankings* for 2021 and the *Center for World University Rankings (CWUR)* for 2020, while UC Irvine, UC Santa Barbara, and UC Davis ranked in the top 100 universities in the world.[94][95] *Forbes* also ranked the six UC campuses mentioned above as being in the top 50 universities in America in 2021.[96] Forbes also named the top three public universities in America as all being UC campuses, namely, Berkeley, UCLA, and UCSD, and ranked three more campuses, UC Davis, UC Santa Barbara, and UC Irvine as being among the top 20 public universities in America in 2021.[97] The six aforementioned campuses are all considered Public Ivies.[7] The *QS World University Rankings* for 2021 ranked three UC campuses: Berkeley, UCLA and UC San Diego as being in the top 100 universities in the world.[98]\n\n\nIndividual academic departments also rank highly among the UC campuses. The 2021 *U.S. News & World Report* Best Graduate Schools report ranked Berkeley as being among the top 5 universities in the nation in the departments of Psychology, Economics, Political Science, Computer Science, Engineering, Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Mathematics, Earth Sciences, Physics, Sociology, History, and English, and ranked UCLA in the top 20 in the same departments.[99][100] *U.S. News & World Report* also ranked the same departments at UC San Diego among the top 20 in the nation, with the exception of the departments of Sociology, History, and English.[101] UC Davis, UC Irvine and UC Santa Barbara ranked in the top 50 in the departments of Psychology, Economics, Political Science, Computer Science, Engineering, Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Mathematics, Earth Sciences, Physics, Sociology, History, and English, with the exception of UC Santa Barbara's Psychology and Political Science departments, according to *U.S. News & World Report*. UC Santa Cruz and UC Riverside ranked in the top 100 in the nation in the same departments, along with UC Merced's Psychology and Political Science departments.[102][103][104]\n\n\n\n| Campus\n | Founded\n | Enrollment\n(2022)[105]\n | Endowment\n(2022)[106]\n | Athletics\n | Rankings\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Affiliation\n | Nickname\n | *ARWU National Ranking*[93] | *ARWU World Ranking*[93] | *CWUR*[94] | *Forbes*[96] | *THE World University Rankings*[95] | *QS World University Rankings*[98] | *U.S. News & World Report National Ranking*[107] | *U.S. News & World Report World Ranking*[85] |\n| ![](image)  **Berkeley** | 1868\n | 45,307\n | $6.91 billion\n | NCAA Div IPac-12 | Golden Bears | 4\n | 5\n | 12\n | 2\n | 8\n | 10\n | 15\n | 4\n |\n| ![](image) **Davis** | 1905\n | 39,679\n | $2.06 billion\n | NCAA Div IBig West | Aggies | 40â54\n | 101â150\n | 52\n | 23\n | 63\n | 132\n | 28\n | 67\n |\n| ![](image) **Irvine** | 1965\n | 35,937\n | $1.25 billion\n | NCAA Div IBig West | Anteaters | 33\n | 61\n | 82\n | 30\n | 95\n | 268\n | 33\n | 86\n |\n| ![](image) **Los Angeles** | 1919\n | 46,430\n | $6.72 billion\n | NCAA Div IPac-12 (Big Ten in 2024) | Bruins | 11\n | 13\n | 18\n | 6\n | 21\n | 29\n | 15\n | 14\n |\n| ![](image) **Merced** | 2005\n | 9,103\n | $85 million\n | NAIACalPac | Golden Bobcats | 107â127\n | 401â500\n | 841\n | 309\n | 301â350\n | â\n | 60\n | 718\n |\n| ![](image) **Riverside** | 1954\n | 26,809\n | $354 million\n | NCAA Div IBig West | Highlanders | 63â85\n | 201â300\n | 252\n | 84\n | 251â300\n | 404\n | 76\n | 169\n |\n| ![](image) **San Diego** | 1960\n | 42,006\n | $2.39 billion\n | NCAA Div IBig West | Tritons | 16\n | 21\n | 33\n | 17\n | 32\n | 62\n | 28\n | 21\n |\n| ![](image) **San Francisco** | 1864\n | 3,140(Graduate only) | $5.46 billion\n | â\n | â\n | 15\n | 19\n | 36\n | â\n | â\n | â\n | â\n | 11\n |\n| ![](image) **Santa Barbara** | 1909\n | 26,420\n | $544 million\n | NCAA Div IBig West | Gauchos | 32\n | 57\n | 98\n | 39\n | 64\n | 163\n | 35\n | 67\n |\n| ![](image) **Santa Cruz** | 1965\n | 19,478\n | $269 million\n | NCAA Div IIIC2C | Banana Slugs | 55â62\n | 151â200\n | 306\n | 87\n | 192\n | 332\n | 82\n | 103\n |\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Doe Memorial Library, main facility of the UC Berkeley Libraries.\n![](image)Langson Library at UC Irvine.\nAs of 2021, UC controls over 13,308 active patents. UC researchers and faculty were responsible for 1,718 new inventions that same year.[2] On average, UC researchers create five new inventions per day.[2]\n\n\nEight of UC's ten campuses (Berkeley, UC Davis, UCI, UCLA, UC Riverside, UCSD, UC Santa Barbara, and UC Santa Cruz) are members of the Association of American Universities (AAU),[2] an alliance of elite American research universities[108] founded in 1900 at UC's suggestion.[109] Collectively, the system counts among its faculty (as of 2002):\n\n\n\n* 389 members of the Academy of Arts and Sciences\n* 5 Fields Medal recipients\n* 19 Fulbright Scholars\n* 25 MacArthur Fellows\n* 254 members of the National Academy of Sciences\n* 91 members of the National Academy of Engineering\n* 13 National Medal of Science laureates\n* 61 Nobel laureates[9]\n* 106 members of the Institute of Medicine\n\n\n### Nobel Prize winners[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Powell Library, main facility of the UCLA Library.\n![](image)Kolligian Library at UC Merced.\nAs of October 2021, the following data are taken from List of Nobel laureates by university affiliation, which counts university alumni and staff, and are not the official count from the University of California. \n\n\n\n\n\n| Campus\n | Nr. of winners\n | Founded\n | Nr. of Winners/\n10 years of age\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Berkeley | 110\n | 1868\n | 7.2\n |\n| San Diego | 28\n | 1960\n | 4.6\n |\n| Los Angeles | 27\n | 1919\n | 2.6\n |\n| Santa Barbara | 14\n | 1909\n | 1.8\n |\n| San Francisco | 10\n | 1864\n | 0.7\n |\n| Irvine | 7\n | 1965\n | 1.3\n |\n| Davis | 4\n | 1905\n | 0.3\n |\n| Riverside | 3\n | 1954\n | 0.4\n |\n| Santa Cruz | 1\n | 1965\n | 0.2\n |\n| Merced | 0\n | 2005\n | 0\n |\n\n\n### UC Libraries[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University of California Libraries\n\n![](image)Davidson Library, the main facility of the UC Santa Barbara Library.\nAt 40.8 million print volumes,[110] the University of California library system is home to one of the largest collections of printed materials in the world. On July 27, 2021, all ten campuses went live with a unified online library catalog, UC Library Search. Besides on-campus libraries, the UC system also maintains two regional library facilities (one each for Northern and Southern California), which each accept older items from all UC campus libraries in their respective region. As of 2019, Northern Regional Library Facility is home to 7.4 million items, while Southern Regional Library Facility is home to 6.5 million items.\n\n\n\n### Academic calendar[edit]\n\n\nEight campuses operate on the quarter system, while two (Berkeley and Merced) are on the semester system. However, all five law schools operate on the semester system, as does the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA.\n\n\n\n### Academic organization[edit]\n\n\n![](image)McHenry Library at UC Santa Cruz.\nDavis, Los Angeles, Riverside, and Santa Barbara all followed Berkeley's example by aggregating the majority of arts, humanities, and science departments into a relatively large College of Letters and Science. Therefore, at Berkeley, Davis, Los Angeles, and Santa Barbara, their respective College of Letters and Science is by far the single largest academic unit on each campus. The College of Letters and Science at Los Angeles is the largest academic unit in the entire UC system.[111] Riverside later separated the natural sciences and kept only social sciences grouped with arts and humanities, an example followed by Merced at its founding.\n\n\nDue to President Kerr's interest in not reproducing the impersonal undergraduate experience often seen in such gigantic academic units, San Diego and Santa Cruz both implemented residential college systems inspired by British models (in which each college has distinctive general education requirements reflecting its chosen theme)[112] and grouped most academic departments into a small number of broadly defined divisions which are all independent of the colleges.\n\n\nFinally, Irvine is organized into 13 schools and San Francisco is organized into four schools, all of which are relatively narrow in scope.\n\n\n\n## Admissions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kerckhoff Hall is home of the Associated Students of the University of California, Los Angeles.\nEach UC campus handles admissions separately, but a student wishing to apply for an undergraduate or transfer admission uses one application for all UC campuses. Graduate and professional school admissions are handled directly and separately by each department or program to which one applies.\n\n\nIn May 2020, UC approved plans to suspend standardized testing score requirements in admissions until 2024.[113] In May 2021, after a student lawsuit, the University of California announced that it would no longer consider SAT and ACT scores in admissions and scholarship decisions.[114]\n\n\nThe Early Academic Outreach Program (EAOP) was established in 1976 by University of California (UC) in response to the State Legislature's recommendation to expand post-secondary opportunities to all of California's students including those who are first-generation, socioeconomically disadvantaged, and English-language learners.[115] As UC's largest academic preparation program, EAOP assists middle and high school students with academic preparation, admissions requirements, and financial aid requirements for higher education.[116] The program designs and provides services to foster students' academic development, and delivers those services in partnership with other academic preparation programs, schools, other higher education institutions and community/industry partners.[117]\n\n\n\n![](image)Haas School of Business at Berkeley is ranked among the best business schools in the world.\nThe University of California admits a significant number of transfer students primarily from the California Community Colleges.[118] Approximately one out of three UC students begin at a community college before graduating.[118] In evaluating a transfer student's application the universities conduct a \"comprehensive review\" process that includes consideration of grade point averages of the generally required, transferable and or related courses for the intended major. The review may also include consideration of an applicant's enrollment in selective honor courses or programs, extracurricular activities, essay, family history, life challenges, and the location of the student's residence. Different universities emphasize different factors in their evaluations.[119]\n\n\n\n### Freshmen[edit]\n\n\nBefore 1986, students who wanted to apply to UC for undergraduate study could only apply to one campus. Students who were rejected at that campus but otherwise met the UC minimum eligibility requirements were *redirected* to another campus with available space.[120][121] Students who did not want to be redirected were refunded their application fees.[*citation needed*] UC Riverside chancellor Ivan Hinderaker explained in 1972: \"Redirection has been a negative rather than a plus. Some come with a chip on their shoulders so big they never give the campus a chance. They poison the attitudes of the students around them.\"[121]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jacobs School of Engineering, at San Diego, is one of the top-ranked engineering schools in the country.\nTherefore, in 1986, the undergraduate application system was changed to the current \"multiple filing\" system, in which students can apply to as many or as few UC campuses as they want on one application, paying a fee for each campus. This significantly increased the number of applications to the Berkeley and Los Angeles campuses, since students could choose a campus to attend after they received acceptance letters, without fear of being redirected to a campus they did not want to attend.[120]\n\n\nThe University of California accepts fully eligible students from among the top one-eighth (1/8) of California public high school graduates through regular statewide admission, or the top 9% of any given high school class through Eligibility in the Local Context (see below). Part of the eligibility process is completion of the A-G requirements in high school. All eligible California high school students who apply are accepted to the university, though not necessarily to the campus of choice.[122][123] Eligible students who are not accepted to the campus(es) of their choice are placed in the \"referral pool\", where campuses with open space may offer admission to those students; in 2003, 10% of students who received an offer through this referral process accepted it.[124] In 2007, about 4,100 UC-eligible students who were not offered admission to their campus of choice were referred to UC Riverside or the system's newest campus, UC Merced.[125] In 2015, all UC-eligible students rejected by their campus of choice were redirected to UC Merced, which is now the only campus that has space for all qualified applicants.[126]\n\n\n\n![](image)UCLA School of Law is one of the top ranked law schools in the United States.\nThe old undergraduate admissions were conducted on a two-phase basis. In the first phase, students were admitted based solely on academic achievement. This accounted for between 50 and 75% of the admissions. In the second phase, the university conducted a \"comprehensive review\" of the student's achievements, including extracurricular activities, essay, family history, and life challenges, to admit the remainder. Students who did not qualify for regular admission were \"admitted by exception\"; in 2002, approximately 2% of newly admitted undergraduates were admitted by exception.[127]\n\n\nThe process for determining admissions varies. At some campuses, such as Santa Barbara and Santa Cruz, a point system is used to weight grade point average, SAT Reasoning or ACT scores, and SAT Subject scores, while at San Diego, Berkeley, and Los Angeles, academic achievement is examined in the context of the school and the surrounding community, known as a holistic review.\n\n\nRace, gender, national origin, and ethnicity were not used as UC admission criteria due to the passing of Proposition 209. This information was collected for statistical purposes.\n\n\nEligibility in the Local Context, commonly referred to as ELC, is met by applicants ranked in the top 9% of their high school class in terms of performance on an 11-unit pattern of UC-approved high school courses. Beginning with fall 2007 applicants, ELC also requires a UC-calculated GPA of at least 3.0. Fully eligible ELC students are guaranteed a spot at one of UC's undergraduate campuses, though not necessarily at their first-choice campus or even to a campus to which they applied.[122]\n\n\nIn 2021, the University of California freshmen class was its most diverse and largest ever, with 84,223 students.[128] Latinos were the largest group at 37%; Asian Americans at 34%; white non-Hispanics at 20%; African-Americans at 5%; and 4% composed of American Indians, Pacific Islanders or those who declined to state their race or ethnicity.[128]\n\n\n\n### Student profile[edit]\n\n\n\n\nPercentage of students and comparisons statewide-nationwide\n|  | Campuses\n(2022)[129]\n | California\n(2022)[130]\n | United States\n(2022)[131]\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **African American** | 5% | 7% | 14%\n |\n| **American Indian** | 1% | 2% | 1%\n |\n| **Asian** | 32% | 16% | 6%\n |\n| **Hispanic/Latino(a)** (of any race; including Chicanos and White Hispanics)\n | 23% | 40% | 19%\n |\n| **Non-Hispanic White** | 22% | 35% | 59%\n |\n| **Pacific Islander** | (<1%)\n | 1%\n | (<1%)\n |\n| **International student** | 15% | N/A | N/A\n |\n| **Unknown** | 3% | N/A | N/A\n |\n\n\n### Admissions practices[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mrak Hall serves as the administrative seat of UC Davis.\nIn many recent years, the University of California has faced growing criticism for high admissions of out-of-state or international students as opposed to in-state, California students. In particular, UC Berkeley and UCLA have been heavily criticized for this phenomenon due to their extraordinarily low acceptance rates compared to other campuses in the system.[132] At a Board of Regents meeting in 2015, California Governor Jerry Brown reportedly said about the problem: \"And so you got your foreign students and you got your 4.0 folks, but just the kind of ordinary, normal students, you know, that got good grades but weren't at the top of the heap thereâthey're getting frozen out.\"[133] State lawmakers have proposed legislation that would reduce out-of-state admission.[134]\n\n\nA 2020 California auditor's report indicated that at least 64 wealthy students were wrongfully admitted to UC schools as favors to powerful figures.[135][136][137] Many of the admissions were justified by falsely classifying the applicants as student athletes. The incidents disproportionately (55 of 64) occurred at UC Berkeley.\n\n\n\n## Research[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology, jointly run by UC San Diego, UC Irvine, and UC Riverside.\nIn 2006 the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC) awarded the University of California the SPARC Innovator Award for its \"extraordinarily effective institution-wide vision and efforts to move scholarly communication forward\", including the 1997 founding (under then UC President Richard C. Atkinson) of the California Digital Library (CDL) and its 2002 launching of CDL's eScholarship, an institutional repository. The award also specifically cited the widely influential 2005 academic journal publishing reform efforts of UC faculty and librarians in \"altering the marketplace\" by publicly negotiating contracts with publishers, as well as their 2006 proposal to amend UC's copyright policy to allow open access to UC faculty research.[138]\n\n\nOn July 24, 2013, the UC Academic Senate adopted an Open Access Policy, mandating that all UC faculty produced research with a publication agreement signed after that date be first deposited in UC's eScholarship open access repository.[139]\n\n\nUniversity of California systemwide research on the SAT exam found that, after controlling for familial income and parental education, so-called achievement tests known as the SAT II had 10 times more predictive ability of college aptitude than the SAT I.[140]\n\n\n\n## Peripheral enterprises[edit]\n\n\nThe University of California has a long tradition of involvement in many enterprises that are often geographically or organizationally separate from its general campuses, including national laboratories, observatories, hospitals, continuing education programs, hotels, conference centers, an airport, a seaport, and an art institute.\n\n\n\n### National laboratories[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in the Berkeley Hills.\nThe University of California directly manages and operates one United States Department of Energy National Laboratory:[141]\n\n\n\n* Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL, or Berkeley Lab) (Berkeley, California)\n\n\nUC is a limited partner in two separate private limited liability companies that manage and operate two other Department of Energy national laboratories:\n\n\n\n* Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) (Los Alamos, New Mexico) operated by Los Alamos National Security, LLC.\n* Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) (Livermore, California) operated by Lawrence Livermore National Security, LLC.\n\n\n![](image)Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory staff on the magnet yoke for the 60-inch cyclotron, 1938; Nobel prize winners Ernest Lawrence, Edwin McMillan, and Luis Alvarez are shown, in addition to J. Robert Oppenheimer and Robert R. Wilson.\nThe **Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory** conducts unclassified research across a wide range of scientific disciplines with key efforts focused on fundamental studies of the universe, quantitative biology, nanoscience, new energy systems and environmental solutions, and the use of integrated computing as a tool for discovery.\n\n\n\n![](image)Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the Livermore Valley.\nThe **Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory** uses advanced science and technology to ensure that U.S. nuclear weapons remain reliable. LLNL also has major research programs in supercomputing and predictive modeling, energy and environment, bioscience and biotechnology, basic science and applied technology, counter-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and homeland security. It is also home to the most powerful supercomputers in the world.\n\n\nThe **Los Alamos National Laboratory** focuses most of its work on ensuring the reliability of U.S. nuclear weapons. Other work at LANL involves research programs into preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction and US national security, such as protection of the US homeland from terrorist attacks.\n\n\nThe UC system's ties to the three laboratories have occasionally sparked controversy and protest, because all three laboratories have been intimately linked with the development of nuclear weapons. During the World War II Manhattan Project, Lawrence Berkeley Lab developed the electromagnetic method for the separation of uranium isotopes used to develop the first atomic bombs. The Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore labs have been involved in designing U.S. nuclear weapons from their inception until the shift into stockpile stewardship after the end of the Cold War. Historically the two national laboratories in Berkeley and Livermore named after Ernest O. Lawrence, have had very close relationships on research projects, as well as sharing some business operations and staff. In fact, LLNL was not officially severed administratively from LBNL until the early 1970s. They also have much deeper ties to the university than the Los Alamos Lab, a fact seen in their respective original names; the University of California Berkeley Radiation Laboratory and the University of California Radiation Laboratory at Livermore.\n\n\n\n![](image)Lick Observatory, atop Mount Hamilton in the Diablo Range.\nThe UC system's ties to the labs have so far outlasted all periods of internal controversy. However, in 2003, the U.S. Department of Energy for the first time opened the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) contract for bidding by other vendors. UC entered into a partnership with Bechtel Corporation, BWXT, and the Washington Group International, and together they created a private company called Los Alamos National Security, LLC (LANS). The only other bidder on the LANL contract was a Lockheed Martin Corporation-created company that included, among others, the University of Texas System. In December 2005, a seven-year contract to manage the laboratory was awarded to the Los Alamos National Security, LLC.[142] On October 1, 2007, the University of California ended its direct involvement in operating the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Management of the laboratory was taken over by Lawrence Livermore National Security, LLC, a limited liability company whose members are Bechtel National, the University of California, Babcock & Wilcox, the Washington Division of URS Corporation, Battelle Memorial Institute, and The Texas A&M University System. Other than UC appointing three members to the two separate boards of directors (each with eleven members) that oversee LANS and LLNS, UC now has virtually no responsibility for or direct involvement in either LANL or LLNL. UC policies and regulations that apply to UC campuses and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California no longer apply to LANL and LLNL, and the LANL and LLNL directors no longer report to the UC Regents or UC Office of the President.\n\n\n\n### Observatories[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Keck Observatory, atop Mauna Kea volcano on the Big Island of Hawaii.\nThe University of California manages two observatories as a multi-campus research unit headquartered at UC Santa Cruz.\n\n\n\n* Lick Observatory atop Mount Hamilton, in the Diablo Range just east of San Jose.\n* Keck Observatory at the 4,145 meters (13,599 feet) summit of Mauna Kea in Hawaii.\n\n\nThe Astronomy Department at the Berkeley campus manages the Hat Creek Radio Observatory in Shasta County.\n\n\n\n### High-performance networking[edit]\n\n\nThe University of California is a founding and charter member of the Corporation for Education Network Initiatives in California, a nonprofit organization that provides high-performance Internet-based networking to California's K-20 research and education community.\n\n\n\n### UC Natural Reserve System[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University of California Natural Reserve System\n\nThe NRS was established in January 1965 to provide UC faculty with large areas of land where they could conduct long-term ecosystem research without having to worry about outside disturbances like tourists. Today, the NRS manages 39 reserves that total more than 756,000 acres (3,060Â km2).\n\n\n\n* Selected reserves of the University of California Natural Reserve System\n* ![Coal Oil Point Reserve](image)\n\nCoal Oil Point Reserve\n* ![Rancho Marino Reserve](image)\n\nRancho Marino Reserve\n* ![Stebbins Cold Canyon Reserve](image)\n\nStebbins Cold Canyon Reserve\n* ![Younger Lagoon Reserve](image)\n\nYounger Lagoon Reserve\n* ![Bodega Marine Reserve](image)\n\nBodega Marine Reserve\n\n\n### UC Agriculture and Natural Resources[edit]\n\n\nUniversity of California Agriculture and Natural Resources[143] (UCANR, Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources) plays an important role in the state's agriculture industry, as mandated by UC's legacy as a land-grant institution. In addition to conducting agriculture and Youth development research, every county in the state has a cooperative extension office with county farm advisors. The county offices also support 4-H programs and have nutrition, family, and consumer sciences advisors who assist local government. Currently, the division's University of California 4-H Youth Development Program[144] is a national leader in studying thriving in the field of youth development.[145]\n\n\n\n### Other national research centers[edit]\n\n\nFrom September 2003 to July 2016, UC managed a contract valued at more than $330 million to establish and operate a University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) at the NASA Ames Research Center at Moffett Federal Airfield âthe largest grant ever awarded the university. UC Santa Cruz managed the UARC for the University of California, with the goal of increasing the science output, safety, and effectiveness of NASA's missions through new technologies and scientific techniques.\n\n\nSince 2002, the NSF-funded San Diego Supercomputer Center at UC San Diego has been managed by the University of California, which took over from the previous manager, General Atomics.\n\n\n\n### Medical centers and schools[edit]\n\n\n![](image)UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital.\nThe University of California operates five medical centers throughout the state:\n\n\n\n* UC Davis Medical Center, in Sacramento;\n* UC Irvine Medical Center, in Orange;\n* UCLA Medical Center, comprising two distinct hospitals:\n\t+ Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, in Los Angeles;\n\t+ UCLA Santa Monica Medical Center, in Santa Monica;\n* UC San Diego Medical Center, comprising two distinct hospitals:\n\t+ UC San Diego Medical Center, Hillcrest, in San Diego;\n\t+ Jacobs Medical Center, in La Jolla; and\n* UCSF Medical Center, operating as a single medical center across three physically distinct campuses around San Francisco.\n\n\n* Medical centers of the University of California\n* ![UCD Medical Center](image)\n\nUCD Medical Center\n* ![UCSD Medical Center](image)\n\nUCSD Medical Center\n* ![UCLA Medical Center](image)\n\nUCLA Medical Center\n* ![UCSF Medical Center](image)\n\nUCSF Medical Center\n* ![UCI Medical Center](image)\n\nUCI Medical Center\n\n\nThere are two medical centers that bear the UCLA name, but are not operated by UCLA: HarborâUCLA Medical Center and Olive ViewâUCLA Medical Center. They are actually Los Angeles County-operated facilities that UCLA uses as teaching hospitals.\n\n\n\n![](image)UCLA Mattel Children's Hospital.\nEach medical center serves as the primary teaching site for that campus's medical school. UCSF is perennially among the top five programs in both research and primary care, and both UCLA and UC San Diego consistently rank among the top fifteen research schools, according to annual rankings published by *U.S. News & World Report*.[146] The teaching hospitals affiliated with each school are also highly regarded â the UCSF Medical Center was ranked the number one hospital in California and number 5 in the country by *U.S. News & World Report*'s 2017 Honor Roll for Best Hospitals in the United States.[147] UC also has a sixth medical schoolâUC Riverside School of Medicine, the only one in the UC system without its own hospital.\n\n\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, the UC hospitals became the cores of full-fledged regional health systems; they were gradually supplemented by many outpatient clinics, offices, and institutes. Three UC hospitals are actually county hospitals that were sold to UC, which means that UC currently plays a major role in providing healthcare to the indigent. The medical hospitals operated by UC Irvine (acquired in 1976), UC Davis (acquired in 1978), and UC San Diego (acquired in 1984) each began as the respective county hospitals of Orange County, Sacramento County, and San Diego County. As of 2021, UC medical centers handle each year about 8.1 million outpatient visits, 349,074 emergency room visits, and roughly 1.1 million inpatient days.[2]\n\n\n\n### Facilities outside of California[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Casa de California in Mexico City.\nUC operates several other miscellaneous sites to support faculty, students, and researchers away from its general campuses:\n\n\n\n* The UC Office of the President's Education Abroad Program currently operates one mini-campus which supports UC students, faculty, and alumni overseas:\n\t+ Casa de California in Mexico City.\n\t+ EAP also briefly operated California House in London during the early-to-mid 2000s.\n* UC Washington Center in Washington, D.C., with a dormitory for students interning with the federal government.\n\t+ UC Davis's UC Center Sacramento supports students interning with the California government.\n* UC Berkeley operates the Richard B. Gump South Pacific Research Station in Mo'orea, French Polynesia on land donated in 1981 by the heir to the founder of the Gump's home furnishings store.[148]\n\n\n### Hospitality facilities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Scripps Institution of Oceanography pier, in La Jolla.\nUnlike other land-grant institutions (e.g., Cornell) UC does not provide a hospitality management program, but it does provide general hospitality at some locations: \n\n\n\n* UC Berkeley's Cal Alumni Association operates travel excursions for alumni (and their families) under its \"Cal Discoveries Travel\" brand (formerly BearTreks); many of the tour guides are Berkeley professors. CAA also operates the oldest and largest alumni association-run family camp in the world, the Lair of the Golden Bear. Located at an altitude of 5600 feet in Pinecrest, California, the Lair is a home-away-from-home for almost 10,000 campers annually. Its attendees are largely Cal alumni and their families, but the Lair is open to everyone.\n* Berkeley Lab operates its own hotel, the Berkeley Lab Guest House, available to persons with business at the Lab itself or UC Berkeley.\n* UCLA Housing & Hospitality Services operates two on-campus hotels, the 61-room Guest House and the 254-room Meyer & Renee Luskin Conference Center, and a lavish off-campus conference center at Lake Arrowhead (with a mix of chalet-like condominiums, lodge rooms, and stand-alone cottages). During the summer, the Lake Arrowhead conference center hosts the Bruin Woods vacation programs for UCLA alumni and their families.\n* Separately, UCLA Health operates the 100-room Tiverton House just south of the UCLA campus to serve its patients and their families.\n* UC Santa Cruz leased the University Inn and Conference Center in downtown Santa Cruz from 2001 to 2011 for use as off-campus student housing.\n\n\n### University Airport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)University of California Museum of Paleontology in Berkeley.\nUC Davis operates the University Airport as a utility airport for air shuttle service in the contractual transportation of university employees and agricultural samples. It is also a public general aviation airport. University Airport's ICAO identifier is KEDU.\n\n\n\n### Seaport[edit]\n\n\nUC San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography owns a seaport, the Nimitz Marine Facility, which is just south of Shelter Island on Point Loma, San Diego. The port is used as an operating base for all of its oceanographic vessels and platforms.\n\n\n\n### UC Extension[edit]\n\n\nFor over a century, the university has operated a continuing education program for working adults and professionals. At present, UC Extension enrolls over 500,000 students each year in over 17,000 courses. One of the reasons for its large size is that UC Extension is a dominant provider of Continuing Legal Education and Continuing Medical Education in California. For example, the systemwide portion of UC Extension (directly controlled by the UC Office of the President) operates Continuing Education of the Bar under a joint venture agreement with the State Bar of California.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)California portal\n* ![](image)San Francisco Bay Area portal\n\n\n* Police departments at the University of California\n* University of California Press\n* University of California Student Association\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** As of June 30, 2022; includes assets managed by UC Regents on behalf of all UC campuses. \"Annual Endowment Report for the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022\" (PDF).

It was founded in 1819 by Thomas Jefferson. The university is set within the Academical Village, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\nThe original governing Board of Visitors included three U.S. presidents: Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and James Monroe, the latter as sitting president of the United States at the time of its foundation. As its first two rectors, Presidents Jefferson and Madison played key roles in the university's foundation, with Jefferson designing both the original courses of study and the university's architecture. Located within its historic 1,135 acre central campus, the university is composed of eight undergraduate and three professional schools: the School of Law, the Darden School of Business, and the School of Medicine.[10]\n\n\nThe University of Virginia's scholars have played a major role in the development of many academic disciplines, including economics,[c] law,[d] literary art,[e] visual art,[f] and the sciences.[11] The university is referred to as a \"Public Ivy\" for offering an academic experience similar to that of an Ivy League university. Admission to the university is considered highly selective, and the university is known in part for its historic foundations, student-run honor code, and secret societies.[12][13][14] In research, the university has been a member of the Association of American Universities for 119â120 years, and the journal *Science* credited its faculty with two of the top ten global scientific breakthroughs in a single year.[11] In sports, the university athletic teams are called the Cavaliers and lead the Atlantic Coast Conference in team NCAA Championships for men's sports, also ranking second in women's and overall titles. In 2015, and again in 2019, the University of Virginia was presented with the Capital One Cup for fielding the nation's best overall athletics programs for men's sports.[15][16]\n\n\nThe university's alumni, faculty, and researchers have included several U.S. presidents, heads of state, Nobel laureates, Pulitzer Prize winners, Rhodes Scholars, Marshall Scholars, and Fulbright Scholars. Some 30 different governors of U.S. states have attended the university, as have numerous U.S. senators and members of Congress. UVA has produced 55 Rhodes Scholars, eighth most in the United States, while its alumni have founded companies such as Reddit, CNET, and Space Adventures.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the University of Virginia\n\n### 1800s[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Thomas Jefferson, the university's founder, by Charles Willson Peale (1791)\n![](image)The Rotunda, as pictured from the South LawnIn 1802, while serving as president of the United States, Thomas Jefferson wrote to artist Charles Willson Peale that his concept of the new university would be \"on the most extensive and liberal scale that our circumstances would call for and our faculties meet,\" and it might even attract talented students from \"other states to come, and drink of the cup of knowledge.\"[17] Virginia was already home to the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, but Jefferson lost all confidence in his *alma mater,* partly because of its religious natureâit required all its students to recite a catechismâand its stifling of the sciences.[18][19] Jefferson had flourished under William & Mary professors William Small and George Wythe decades earlier, but the college was in a period of great decline and his concern became so dire by 1800 that he expressed to British chemist Joseph Priestley, \"we have in that State, a college just well enough endowed to draw out the miserable existence to which a miserable constitution has doomed it.\" Instead, Jefferson sought to found the new university on the Humboldtian model of higher education, enlarging the scope of training beyond the relatively narrow, specialized focus of contemporary universities, to cultivate a more well-rounded student, educated in multiple disciplines (e.g., arts and sciences) simultaneously, a view that promoted the modern \"Liberal Arts\" curriculum offered at almost all public universities.[18][20][21][22] These words would ring true some seventy years later when William & Mary fell bankrupt after the Civil War and the Williamsburg college was shuttered completely in 1881, later being revived as primarily a small college for teachers until it regained University status later in the twentieth century.[23]\n\n\nIn 1817, three presidents (Jefferson, James Monroe, and James Madison) and Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court John Marshall joined 24 other dignitaries at a meeting held in the Mountain Top Tavern at Rockfish Gap. After some deliberation, they selected nearby Charlottesville as the site of the new University of Virginia.[24] Farmland just outside Charlottesville was purchased from James Monroe by the Board of Visitors for construction of a newly chartered regional school to be known as *Central College,* which itself was an institutional successor to Albemarle Academy though neither school would ever open for instruction. The school laid its first building's cornerstone late in that same year, and the ongoing building of the Academical Village proved influential as the Commonwealth of Virginia chartered a new flagship university to be based on the site in Charlottesville on January 25, 1819. John Hartwell Cocke collaborated with James Madison, Monroe, and Joseph Carrington Cabell to fulfill Jefferson's dream to establish the university. Cocke and Jefferson were appointed to the building committee to supervise the construction.[25] The university was built on Monacan Indian Nation tribal land. UVA is continuing to \"seek opportunities to engage and acknowledge with respect that we live, learn, and work on the territory of the Monacan Indian Nation\"[26] Like many of its peers,[27] the university owned slaves who helped build the campus.[28] They also served students and professors.[28] The university's first classes met on March 7, 1825.[29]\n\n\nIn contrast to other universities of the day, at which one could study in either medicine, law, or divinity, the first students at the University of Virginia could study in one or several of eight independent schools â medicine, law, mathematics, chemistry, ancient languages, modern languages, natural philosophy, and moral philosophy.[30] Another innovation of the new university was that higher education would be separated from religious doctrine. UVA had no divinity school, was established independently of any religious sect, and the Grounds were planned and centered upon a library, the Rotunda, rather than a church, distinguishing it from peer universities still primarily functioning as seminaries for one particular strain of Protestantism or another.[31] Jefferson opined to philosopher Thomas Cooper that \"a professorship of theology should have no place in our institution\", and never has there been one. There were initially two degrees awarded by the university: *Graduate,* to a student who had completed the courses of one school; and *Doctor* to a graduate in more than one school who had shown research prowess.[32]\n\n\n\n![](image)James Madison was the second rector of the University of Virginia until 1836.\nJefferson was intimately involved in the university to the end, hosting Sunday dinners at his Monticello home for faculty and students. Jefferson viewed the university's foundation as having such great importance and potential that he counted it among his greatest accomplishments and insisted his grave mention only his status as author of the Declaration of Independence and Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, and father of the University of Virginia. Thus, he eschewed mention of his national accomplishments, such as the Louisiana Purchase and any other aspects of his presidency, in favor of his role with the young university.\n\n\nInitially, some of the students arriving at the university matched the then-common picture of college students: wealthy, spoiled aristocrats with a sense of privilege which often led to brawling, or worse. This was a source of frustration for Jefferson, who assembled the students during the school's first year, on October 3, 1825, to criticize such behavior; but was too overcome to speak. He later spoke of this moment as \"the most painful event\" of his life.[33]\n\n\nAlthough the frequency of such irresponsible behavior dropped after Jefferson's expression of concern, it did not die away completely. Like many universities and colleges, it experienced periodic student riots, culminating in the shooting death of Professor John A. G. Davis, Chairman of the Faculty, in 1840. This event, in conjunction with the growing popularity of temperance and a rise in religious affiliation in society in general, seems to have resulted in a permanent change in student attitudes, and the behavior among students that had so greatly bothered Jefferson finally vanished.[33]\n\n\nIn the year of Jefferson's death in 1826, poet Edgar Allan Poe enrolled at the university, where he excelled in Latin.[34] The Raven Society, an organization named after Poe's most famous poem, continues to maintain 13 West Range, the room Poe inhabited during the single semester he attended the university.[35] He left because of financial difficulties. The School of Engineering and Applied Science opened in 1836, making UVA the first comprehensive university to open an engineering school.\n\n\nUnlike the majority of Southern colleges, the university was kept open throughout the Civil War, despite its state seeing more bloodshed than any other and the near 100% conscription of the American South.[36] After Jubal Early's total loss at the Battle of Waynesboro, Charlottesville was willingly surrendered to Union forces to avoid mass bloodshed, and UVA faculty convinced George Armstrong Custer to preserve Jefferson's university.[37] Although Union troops camped on the Lawn and damaged many of the Pavilions, Custer's men left four days later without bloodshed and the university was able to return to its educational mission. However, an extremely high number of officers of both Confederacy and Union were alumni.[38] UVA produced 1,481 officers in the Confederate Army alone, including four major-generals, twenty-one brigadier-generals, and sixty-seven colonels from ten different states.[38] John S. Mosby, the infamous \"Gray Ghost\" and commander of the lightning-fast 43rd Battalion Virginia Cavalry ranger unit, had also been a UVA student.\n\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikisource has the text of an 1879 *American CyclopÃ¦dia* article about ***UVA's 16 schools in operation as of 1879***.\n\nThanks to a grant from the Commonwealth of Virginia, tuition became free for all Virginians in the year 1875.[39] During this period, the University of Virginia remained unique in that it had no president and mandated no core curriculum from its students, who often studied in and took degrees from more than one school.[39] However, the university was also experiencing growing pains. As the original Rotunda caught fire and was gutted in 1895, there would soon be sweeping changes, much greater than merely reconstructing the Rotunda in 1899.\n\n\n\n### 1900s[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Edwin Alderman was UVA's first president between 1904 and 1931, and instituted many reforms toward modernization.\n![](image)\n\nWikisource has original text related to this article:\n**July 1905 *Popular Science* article about UVA taking a President**\n\nJefferson had originally decided the University of Virginia would have no serving president. Rather, this power was to be shared by a rector and the Board of Visitors. But as the 19th century waned, it became obvious this cumbersome arrangement was incapable of adequately handling the many administrative and fundraising tasks of the growing university.[40] Edwin Alderman, who had only recently moved from his post as president of UNC-Chapel Hill since 1896 to become president of Tulane University in 1900, accepted an offer as president of the University of Virginia in 1904. His appointment was not without controversy, and national media such as *Popular Science* lamented the end of one of the things that made UVA unique among universities.[41]\n\n\nAlderman stayed 27 years, and became known as a prolific fund-raiser, a well-known orator, and a close adviser to U.S. president and UVA alumnus Woodrow Wilson.[40] He added significantly to the University Hospital to support new sickbeds and public health research, and helped create departments of geology and forestry, the School of Education and Human Development (originally the Curry School of Education), the McIntire School of Commerce, and the summer school programs in which young Georgia O'Keeffe took part.[42] Perhaps his greatest ambition was the funding and construction of a library on a scale of millions of books, much larger than the Rotunda could bear. Delayed by the Great Depression, Alderman Library was named in his honor in 1938. Alderman, who seven years earlier had died in office en route to giving a public speech at the University of Illinois at UrbanaâChampaign, is still the longest-tenured president of the university.\n\n\nIn 1904, UVA became the first university south of Washington, D.C. to be elected to the Association of American Universities. After a gift by Andrew Carnegie in 1909 the University of Virginia was organized into twenty-six departments across six schools including the Andrew Carnegie School of Engineering, the James Madison School of Law, the James Monroe School of International Law, the James Wilson School of Political Economy, the Edgar Allan Poe School of English and the Walter Reed School of Pathology.[32] The honorific historical names for these schools â several of which have remained as modern schools of the university â are no longer used.\n\n\nIn December 1953, the University of Virginia joined the Atlantic Coast Conference for athletics. At the time, UVA had a football program that had just broken through to be nationally ranked in 1950, 1951, and 1952, and consistently beat its rivals North Carolina and Virginia Tech by scores such as 34â7 and 44â0. Other sports were very competitive as well. However, the administration of Colgate Darden de-emphasized athletics, defunding the department and declining to join the ACC before being overruled by the Board of Visitors on that decision. It would take until the 1980s for the bulk of athletics programs to fully recover, but approaching the year 2000 UVA was again one of the most successful all-around sports programs with NCAA national titles achieved in an array of different sports; by 2020, it had twice won the Capital One Cup for overall athletics excellence in men's sports programs.\n\n\nUVA established a junior college in 1954, known today as the University of Virginia's College at Wise. George Mason University and the aforementioned Mary Washington University used to exist as similar satellite campuses, but those are now wholly self-administered schools.\n\n\nThe Academical Village and nearby Monticello became a joint World Heritage Site in 1987. Simultaneously with HawaiÊ»i Volcanoes National Park and Chaco Culture National Historical Park, they were the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth U.S. sites designated as culturally significant to the collective interests of global humanity, coming after the Statue of Liberty and Yosemite National Park three years earlier. As such, UVA possesses the only U.S. collegiate grounds to be internationally protected by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).\n\n\n\n#### Integration, coeducation, and student dissent[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Virginia first admitted a few selected women to graduate studies in the late 1890s and to certain programs such as nursing and education in the 1920s and 1930s.[43] In 1944, Mary Washington College in Fredericksburg, Virginia, became the Women's Undergraduate Arts and Sciences Division of the University of Virginia. With this branch campus in Fredericksburg exclusively for women, UVA maintained its main campus in Charlottesville as near-exclusively for men, until a civil rights lawsuit in the 1960s forced it to commingle the sexes.[44] In 1970, the Charlottesville campus became fully co-educational, and in 1972 Mary Washington became an independent state university.[45] When the first female class arrived, 450 undergraduate women entered UVA, comprising 39 percent of undergraduates, while the number of men admitted remained constant. By 1999, women made up a 52 percent majority of the total student body.[43][46]\n\n\nThe university admitted its first black student when Gregory Swanson sued to gain entrance into the university's law school in 1950.[47] Following his successful lawsuit, a handful of black graduate and professional students were admitted during the 1950s, though no black undergraduates were admitted until 1955, and UVA did not fully integrate until the 1960s.[47] When Walter Ridley graduated with a doctorate in education, he was the first black person to graduate from UVA.[47] UVA's Ridley Scholarship Fund is named in his honor.[47]\n\n\nThe fight for integration and coeducation came to the foreground particularly in the late 1960s, leading up to the May Strike of 1970, in which students protested for higher black enrollment, equal access to UVA admission by undergraduate women, unionization of employees, and against the presence of armed university police and recruiters of government agencies such as the CIA and FBI on Grounds.[48]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)President Sullivan speaking with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in front of the Rotunda in February 2013\nDue to a continual decline in state funding for the university, today only 6 percent of its budget comes from the Commonwealth of Virginia.[49] A Charter initiative was signed into law by then-Governor Mark Warner in 2005, negotiated with the university to have greater autonomy over its own affairs in exchange for accepting this decline in financial support.[50][51]\n\n\nThe university welcomed Teresa A. Sullivan as its first female president in 2010.[52] Just two years later its first woman rector, Helen Dragas, engineered a forced-resignation to remove President Sullivan from office.[53][54] The attempted ouster elicited a faculty Senate vote of no confidence in Rector Dragas, and demands from student government for an explanation.[55][56] In the face of mounting pressure including alumni threats to cease contributions, and a mandate from then-Governor Robert McDonnell to resolve the issue or face removal of the entire Board of Visitors, the Board unanimously reinstated President Sullivan.[57][58][59] In 2013 and 2014, the Board passed new bylaws that made it harder to remove a president and possible to remove a rector.[60]\n\n\nIn November 2014, the university suspended fraternity and sorority functions pending investigation of an article by *Rolling Stone* concerning an alleged rape story, which was later determined to be a hoax after the story was confirmed to be false through investigation by *The Washington Post*.[61][62][63] The university nonetheless instituted new rules banning \"pre-mixed drinks, punches or any other common source of alcohol\" such as beer kegs and requiring \"sober and lucid\" fraternity members to monitor all parties.[64] In April 2015, *Rolling Stone* fully retracted the article after the Columbia School of Journalism released a report of what went wrong with the article in a scathing and discrediting report.[65][66] Even before release of the Columbia University report, the *Rolling Stone* story was named the \"Error of the Year\" by the Poynter Institute.[67] The UVA chapter of Phi Kappa Psi settled a defamation suit against *Rolling Stone* and received $1.65Â million.[68]\n\n\nIn August 2017, the night before the infamous Unite the Right rally, a group of non-student and mostly non-Virginian white nationalists marched on the university's Lawn bearing torches and chanting antisemitic and Nazi slogans after the city of Charlottesville decided to remove all remaining Confederate statues from the city including one depicting Robert E. Lee.[69][70] They were met by student counter-protesters near the statue of Thomas Jefferson in front of the Rotunda, where a fight broke out.\n\n\nJames E. Ryan, a graduate of the University of Virginia School of Law, became the university's ninth president in August 2018.[71] His first act upon his inauguration was to announce that in-state undergraduates from families making less than $80,000 per year would receive full scholarships covering tuition, and those from families making under $30,000 would also receive free room and board.[72] Ryan was previously dean of the Harvard School of Education.\n\n\nOn the night of November 13, 2022, three students were killed and two others injured in a shooting on a charter bus that was returning to the campus from a play for a class trip in Washington, D.C.[73] All three fatalities were current members of the Virginia Cavaliers football team[74] and the alleged shooter was briefly a member of the team during the 2018 season.[75]\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Rotunda, as painted by American modernist painter Georgia O'Keeffe in the early 1910s when she was a Summer Session student\nThe UVA campus, referred to as the Grounds,[76] straddles the border between the city of Charlottesville and Albemarle County.[77] The university also maintains 562 acres north of the campus at North Fork and 2,913 acres southeast of the city at Morven Farm.[78][79][6][14] It also is in the process of building a campus in Northern Virginia within Fairfax, Virginia.[80]\n\n\n\n### Academical Village[edit]\n\n\nSee also: The Lawn, The Rotunda, and The Range\n\nThroughout its history, the University of Virginia has won praise for its unique Jeffersonian architecture. In January 1895, less than a year before the Great Rotunda Fire, *The New York Times* said the design of the University of Virginia \"was incomparably the most ambitious and monumental architectural project that had or has yet been conceived in this century.\"[81] In the United States Bicentennial issue of their *AIA Journal*, the American Institute of Architects called it \"the proudest achievement of American architecture in the past 200 years.\"[82] The Academical Village, together with Jefferson's home at Monticello, which he also designed, is a World Heritage Site. The first collegiate architecture and culture World Heritage Site in the world, it was listed by UNESCO in 1987.[14][83]\n\n\nJefferson's original architectural design revolves around the *Academical Village*, and that name remains in use today to describe both the specific area of the Lawn, a grand, terraced green space surrounded by residential and academic buildings, the gardens, the Range, and the larger university surrounding it. The principal building of the design, the Rotunda, stands at the north end of the Lawn, and is the most recognizable symbol of the university. It is half the height and width of the Pantheon in Rome, which was the primary inspiration for the building. The Lawn and the Rotunda were the models for many similar designs of \"centralized green areas\" at universities across the country. The space was designed for students and professors to live in the same area. The Rotunda, which symbolized knowledge, showed hierarchy. The south end of the Lawn was left open to symbolize the view of cultivated fields to the south, as reflective of Jefferson's ideal for an agrarian-focused nation.\n\n\nMost notably designed by inspiration of the Rotunda and Lawn are the expansive green spaces headed by similar buildings built at: Duke University in 1892; Columbia University in 1895; Johns Hopkins University in 1902; Rice University in 1910; Peabody College of Vanderbilt University in 1915; Killian Court at MIT in 1916; the Grand Auditorium of Tsinghua University built in 1917 in Beijing, China; the Sterling Quad of Yale Divinity School in 1932; and the university's own Darden School in 1996.\n\n\n\n![](image)Winter view toward the South Lawn\nFlanking both sides of the Rotunda and extending down the length of the Lawn are ten Pavilions interspersed with student housing rooms. Each has its own classical architectural style, as well as its own walled garden separated by Jeffersonian Serpentine walls. These walls are called \"serpentine\" because they run a sinusoidal course, one that lends strength to the wall and allows for the wall to be only one brick thick, one of many innovations by which Jefferson attempted to combine aesthetics with utility.[84]\n\n\nOn October 27, 1895, the Rotunda burned to a shell because of an electrical fire that started in the Rotunda Annex, a long multi-story structure built in 1853 to house additional classrooms. The electrical fire was no doubt assisted by the help of overzealous faculty member William \"Reddy\" Echols, who attempted to save it by throwing roughly 100 pounds (45Â kg) of dynamite into the main fire in the hopes the blast would separate the burning Annex from Jefferson's own Rotunda. His last-ditch effort ultimately failed. Perhaps ironically, one of the university's main honors student programs is named for him. University officials swiftly approached celebrity architect Stanford White to rebuild the Rotunda. White took the charge further, disregarding Jefferson's design and redesigning the Rotunda interiorâmaking it two floors instead of three, adding three buildings to the foot of the Lawn, and designing a president's house. He did omit rebuilding the Rotunda Annex, the remnants of which were used as fill and to create part of the modern-day Rotunda's northern-facing plaza. The classes formerly occupying the Annex were moved to the South Lawn in White's new buildings.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe White buildings have the effect of closing off the sweeping perspective, as originally conceived by Jefferson, down the Lawn across open countryside toward the distant mountains. The White buildings at the foot of the Lawn effectively create a huge \"quadrangle\", albeit one far grander than any traditional college quadrangle at the University of Cambridge or University of Oxford.\n\n\nIn concert with the United States Bicentennial in 1976, Stanford White's changes to the Rotunda were removed and the building was returned to Jefferson's original design. Renovated according to original sketches and historical photographs, a three-story Rotunda opened on Jefferson's birthday, April 13, 1976. Queen Elizabeth II came to visit the Rotunda in that same year for the Bicentennial, and had a well-publicized stroll of the Lawn. The university was listed by *Travel + Leisure* in September 2011 as one of the most beautiful campuses in the United States and by MSN as one of the most beautiful college campuses in the world.[85][86]\n\n\n\n### Libraries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Inside the Law Library\nThe first library at the University of Virginia was the Rotunda. Rather than a chapel or other religious structure, the university was built around its own library. Thomas Jefferson was deeply engaged in selecting the materials that made up that library's original collection, and in developing the system by which it would be organized. The Rotunda served as the University Library for over a century, until Alderman Library was opened in 1937.[87]\n\n\nThe University of Virginia Library System consists of a dozen libraries and holds over 5Â million volumes. Its Electronic Text Center, established in 1992, has put 70,000 books online as well as 350,000 images that go with them. These e-texts are open to anyone and, as of 2002[update], were receiving 37,000 daily visits (compared to 6,000 daily visitors to the physical libraries).[88] Alderman Library holds the most extensive Tibetan collection in the world, and holds ten floors of book \"stacks\" of varying ages and historical value. The Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library features a collection of American literature as well as two copies of the original printing of the Declaration of Independence. It was in this library in 2006 that Robert Stilling, an English graduate student, discovered an unpublished Robert Frost poem from 1918.[89] Clark Hall is the library for SEAS (the engineering school), and one of its notable features is the Mural Room, decorated by two three-panel murals by Allyn Cox, depicting the Moral Law and the Civil Law. The murals were finished and set in place in 1934.[90] As of 2006[update], the university and Google were working on the digitization of selected collections from the library system.[91]\n\n\nSince 1992, the University of Virginia also hosts the Rare Book School, a non-profit organization in the study of historical books and the history of printing that began at Columbia University in 1983.\n\n\n\n### Other areas[edit]\n\n\nHousing for first-year students, Brown College, the School of Engineering and Applied Science and the University of Virginia Medical School are near the historic Lawn and Range area. The McIntire School of Commerce is on the actual Lawn, in Rouss-Roberston Hall.\n\n\n\n![](image)Recessed windows of the monolithic Hereford College\nAway from the historic area, UVA's architecture and its allegiance to the Jeffersonian design are controversial. The 1990s saw the construction of two deeply contrasting visions: the Williams Tsien post-modernist Hereford College in 1992 and the unapologetically Jeffersonian Darden School of Business in 1996. Commentary on both was broad and partisan, as the University of Virginia School of Architecture and *The New York Times* lauded Hereford for its bold new lines, while some independent press and wealthy donors praised the traditional design of the Darden school.[92][93] The latter group appeared to have the upper hand when the South Lawn Project was designed in the early 2000s.[93][94]\n\n\nBillionaire John Kluge donated 7,379 acres (29.86Â km2) of additional lands to the university in 2001. Kluge desired the core of the land, the 2,913-acre Morven, to be developed by the university and the surrounding land to be sold to fund an endowment supporting the core. Five farms totaling 1,261 acres (510Â ha) of the gift were soon sold to musician Dave Matthews, of the Dave Matthews Band, to be used in an organic farming project to complement his nearby Blenheim Vineyards.[95] Morven has since hosted the Morven Summer Institute, a rigorous immersion program of study in civil society, sustainability, and creativity.[96] As of 2014[update], the university is developing further plans for Morven and has hired an architecture firm for the nearly three thousand acre property.[96] In addition, the UVA Foundation owns the building and grounds of the Kluge-Ruhe Aboriginal Art Collection. The Collection itself is also owned by the University of Virginia.[97]\n\n\n\n### Student housing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)54 students are selected to live on the Lawn during their final year.\nThe primary housing areas for first-year students are McCormick Road Dormitories, often called \"Old Dorms\", Alderman Road Dormitories, often called \"New Dorms,\" and suite style dorms located off of Alderman road near the football stadium. The 1970s-era Alderman Road Dorms are being fully replaced with brand new dormitory buildings in the same area. The replacements feature hall-style living arrangements with common areas and many modern amenities. Instead of being torn down and replaced like the original New Dorms, the Old Dorms have seen a $105Â million renovation project between 2017 and 2022.[98] They were constructed in 1950, and are also hall-style constructions but with fewer amenities. The Old Dorms are closer to the students' classes.\n\n\nIn the 1980s, in response to a housing shortage, the Stadium Road Residential Area was built to the south of the Alderman Road Dormitories.[99] The largest of the houses in this area are the Gooch Dillard Residence Halls which house 610 students and are suite style type dorms.\n\n\nThere are three residential colleges at the university: Brown College, Hereford College, and the International Residential College. These involve an application process to live there, and are filled with both upperclass and first-year students. The application process can be extremely competitive, especially for Brown because of its location in central Grounds near classroom buildings, libraries, and Newcomb Hall.\n\n\nIt is considered a great honor and privilege to be invited to live on the Lawn, and 54 fourth-year undergraduates do so each year, joining ten members of the faculty who permanently live and teach in the Pavilions there.[100] Similarly, graduate students may live on the Range. Edgar Allan Poe formerly lived in 13 West Range, and since 1904 the Raven Society has retrofitted and preserved his room much as it may have existed back in the 1820s.\n\n\n\n## Organization and administration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikisource has the text of a 1911 *EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica* article about circa 1911 organization of the university.\n\nThe university has several affiliated centers including the Rare Book School, headquarters of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, University of Virginia Miller Center for Politics, Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service, Sorensen Institute for Political Leadership, Institute for Advanced Studies in Culture, and Miller Center of Public Affairs. The Fralin Museum of Art is dedicated to creating an environment where both the university community and the general public can study and learn from directly experiencing works of different art. The university has its own internal recruiting firm, the Executive Search Group and Strategic Resourcing. Since 2013, this department has been housed under the Office of the President.\n\n\nIn 2006, President Casteen announced an ambitious $3Â billion capital campaign to be completed by December 2011.[101] During the Great Recession, President Sullivan missed the 2011 deadline, and extended it indefinitely.[102] The $3Â billion goal would be met a year and a half later, which President Sullivan announced at graduation ceremonies in May 2013.[103]\n\n\nAs of 2013[update], UVA's $1.4Â billion academic budget is paid for primarily by tuition and fees (32%), research grants (23%), endowment and gifts (19%), and sales and services (12%).[104] The university receives 10% of its academic funds through state appropriation from the Commonwealth of Virginia.[104] For the overall (including non-academic) university budget of $2.6Â billion, 45% comes from medical patient revenue.[104] The Commonwealth contributes less than 6%.[104]\n\n\n\n\n\n| UVA colleges and schools\n |\n| --- |\n| **College/school** | **Year founded** |\n| \n\n---\n\n |\n| School of Architecture | 1954\n |\n| College of Arts & Sciences | 1824\n |\n| Darden School of Business | 1954\n |\n| McIntire School of Commerce | 1921\n |\n| School of Continuing and Professional Studies | 1915\n |\n| School of Data Science | 2019\n |\n| School of Education and Human Development | 1905\n |\n| School of Engineering and Applied Science | 1836\n |\n| School of Law | 1819\n |\n| Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy | 2007\n |\n| School of Medicine | 1819\n |\n| School of Nursing | 1901\n |\n\n\nAlthough UVA is the flagship university of Virginia, state funding has decreased for several consecutive decades.[49] Financial support from the state dropped by half from 12 percent of total revenue in 2001â02 to six percent in 2013â14.[49] The portion of academic revenue coming from the state fell by even more in the same period, from 22 percent to just nine percent.[49] This nominal support from the state, contributing just $154Â million of UVA's $2.6Â billion budget in 2012â13, has led President Sullivan and others to contemplate the partial privatization of the University of Virginia.[105] UVA's Darden School and Law School are already self-sufficient.\n\n\nHunter R. Rawlings III, President of the prominent Association of American Universities research group of universities, came to Charlottesville to make a speech to university faculty which included a statement about the proposal: \"there's no possibility, as far as I can see, that any state will ever relinquish its ownership and governance of its public universities, much less of its flagship research university\".[105] He encouraged university leaders to stop talking about privatization and instead push their state lawmakers to increase funding for higher education and research as a public good.[105]\n\n\nAs of 2013, the University of Virginia was one of only two public universities in the United States that had a Triple-A credit rating from all three major credit rating agencies.[106]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Virginia offers 48 bachelor's degrees, 94 master's degrees, 55 doctoral degrees, 6 educational specialist degrees, and 2 first-professional degrees (Medicine and Law) to its students. All degrees are earned and UVA has never bestowed an honorary degree to any person.[107][108][109]\n\n\n\n### Scholarships[edit]\n\n\nThe Jefferson Scholarship is the most competitive merit scholarship nationwide. Around 30 scholars are selected annually from a direct application pool of 4,500 nominating schools, each able to nominate only one student. Covering all tuition, books, room and board, the scholarship also provides scholars finances for summer enrichment, independent research and study abroad.\n\n\nEchols Scholars (College of Arts and Sciences) and Rodman Scholars (School of Engineering and Applied Science), which include 6â7% of undergraduate students, receive no financial benefits, but are entitled to special advisors, priority course registration, residence in designated dorms and fewer curricular constraints than other students have.[110]\n\n\n\n![](image)Alderman Library is home to 1.7Â million books.[111] It is one of eleven libraries at UVA, and hosts one-third of the 1.9 million visitors to the system each year as of 2018.[112]\nFull tuition scholarships are given to each in-state student from families earning under $80,000 dollars per year.[72] Each in-state student from families earning under $30,000 dollars per year also receives free room and board.[72] These scholarships are initiatives of President Ryan, who announced them upon his inauguration in 2018.[72]\n\n\n\n### Research[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Virginia is the first and longest serving public member of the Association of American Universities in the American South, attaining membership in 1904.[113] It is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities â Very high research activity\".[114]\n\n\nAccording to the National Science Foundation, UVA spent $614Â million on research and development in 2019, ranking it 44th in the nation and first in Virginia.[115] Built in 1996, North Fork (formerly the UVA Research Park[116] is an extensive 3.7-million square foot, 562 acre research park nine miles north of UVA's North Grounds.[117][118] It houses the UVA Applied Research Institute as well as many private R&D efforts by such firms as Battelle, The MITRE Corporation, Signature Science, and CACI.[118][119]\n\n\nUVA is also home to globally recognized research on hypersonic flight for NASA and other organizations.[120] The United States Air Force, National Science Foundation, and National Center for Hypersonic Combined Cycle Propulsion have each also granted UVA researchers millions in funding for the university's ongoing broad and deep research into ultra-high velocity flight.[120] Starting in 2015, a UVA team led by mechanical engineering professor Eric Loth began Department of Energy-funded research into an original design of offshore wind turbines that would potentially dwarf the size and scope of any being produced or researched anywhere else.[121] The innovative design inspired by palm trees led to Loth being named to a *Popular Science* list of \"The Brilliant Minds Behind The New Energy Revolution\".[121][122][123]\n\n\n\n![](image)2015 UVA research \"redrew the map\" of the human lymphatic system, shown here in the 1858 *Gray's Anatomy*.\nUVA was recognized by *Science* as leading two of the top 10 scientific discoveries in the world in 2015.[11] The first breakthrough was when UVA School of Medicine researchers Jonathan Kipnis and Antoine Louveau discovered previously unknown vessels connecting the human brain directly to the lymphatic system.[11] The discovery \"redrew the map\" of the lymphatic system, rewrote medical textbooks, and struck down long-held beliefs about how the immune system functions in the brain.[11] The discovery may help greatly in combating neurological diseases from multiple sclerosis to Alzheimer's disease.[11] The second globally recognized breakthrough of 2015 was when UVA psychology professor Brian Nosek examined the reproducibility of 100 psychology studies and found fewer than half could be reproduced.[11] The discovery may have profound impacts on how psychological studies are performed and documented.[11] More than 270 researchers on five continents were involved, and twenty-two students and faculty from UVA were listed as co-authors on the scientific paper.[11]\n\n\nIn the field of astrophysics, the university is a member of a consortium engaged in the construction and operation of the Large Binocular Telescope in the Mount Graham International Observatory of the Pinaleno Mountains of southeastern Arizona. It is also a member of both the Astrophysical Research Consortium, which operates telescopes at Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico, and the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy which operates the National Optical Astronomy Observatory, the Gemini Observatory and the Space Telescope Science Institute. The University of Virginia hosts the headquarters of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, which operates the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia and the Very Large Array radio telescope made famous in the Carl Sagan television documentary *Cosmos* and film *Contact*. The North American Atacama Large Millimeter Array Science Center is also at the Charlottesville NRAO site. In 2019, researchers at NRAO co-authored a study documenting the discovery of a pair of giant hourglass shaped balloons emanating radio waves from the center of our Milky Way galaxy.[124]\n\n\n\n### Innovation[edit]\n\n\nThe Charlottesville area has been named the No. 1 fastest growing metropolitan area for venture capital in the United States, with $27.7Â million in annual funding as of 2015[update].[125] A majority of the successful startups in the Charlottesville region have been started by or funded by both UVA students and graduates.[125] One example of a startup launched by university students is Reddit, the seventh most-viewed website in the U.S. with hundreds of billions of annual pageviews as of JulyÂ 2021[update],[126] founded by UVA roommates Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian in 2005. They were students at the School of Engineering and Applied Science and the McIntire School of Commerce, respectively. Having grown so large, Reddit is now headquartered in San Francisco. Another example is CNET, which has become the highest-read technology news source on the Web, with over 200Â million readers per month, being among the 200 most visited websites globally as of 2015.[127][128][129]\n\n\nIn addition to McIntire and SEAS, the Darden School has spawned highly innovative graduates and entrepreneurs. For example, a wearable glove that helps to rehabilitate stroke patients was brought to market by a Darden graduate in South Korea during 2015.[130] According to a study by researchers at the Darden School and Stanford University, UVA alumni overall have founded over 65,000 companies which have employed 2.3Â million people worldwide with annual global revenues of $1.6Â trillion.[131]\n\n\n\n### Rankings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Academic rankings |\n| --- |\n| National |\n| *Forbes*[132] | 29 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[133] | 24 |\n| *Washington Monthly*[134] | 28 |\n| Global |\n| *ARWU*[135] | 201â300 |\n| *QS*[136] | 260 |\n| *THE*[137] | 156= |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[138] | 119 |\n\n\n*U.S. News & World Report* ranks UVA 24th among national universities overall,[139] 8th best business program[140] and 3rd best business management program in the country.[141]\n\n\nAmong the professional schools of UVA, *U.S. News & World Report'*s 2021 rankings place its law school 8th best overall and 1st among public universities, its graduate Darden School of Business 11th overall and 2nd among public universities, the medical school 6th overall in the \"Primary Care\" category and tied for 29th overall in the \"Research\" category, and the engineering school tied for 41st overall.[142] In its 2015 rankings, *The Economist* lists Darden 2nd overall globally and 1st among public institutions.[143] In its 2016 listing, *Bloomberg BusinessWeek* ranked the McIntire School of Commerce, UVA's undergraduate business program, 5th overall and 2nd among public universities.[144]\n\n\n*Washington Monthly* ranked UVA 28th in its 2020 ranking of national universities based on its contribution to the public good, as measured by social mobility, research, and promoting good public service.[145] In its 2016 report, *Business Insider*, which strives to measure preparation for the professional workforce, ranked UVA ninth overall and first among public universities.[146]\n\n\n\n### Other recognition[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Virginia has also been recognized for consistently having the highest African American graduation rate among national public universities.[147][148][149] According to the Fall 2005 issue of *Journal of Blacks in Higher Education*, UVA \"has the highest black student graduation rate of the Public Ivies\" and \"by far the most impressive is the University of Virginia with its high black student graduation rate and its small racial difference in graduation rates.\"[150]\n\n\n\n### Undergraduate admissions and financial aid[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Undergraduate admissions statistics |\n| --- |\n| 2023 enteringclass[151]Change vs.2018[152]\n\n\n---\n\n |\n| Admit rate | 16.2% (![Neutral decrease](image)Â â11.1)\n |\n| Yield rate | 39.1% (![Increase](image)Â +1)\n |\n| Test scores middle 50% |\n| SAT Total | 1400-1510(among 51% of FTFs) |\n| ACT Composite | 32-35(among 21% of FTFs) |\n|  |\n\n\nFor the undergraduate Class of 2023, the University of Virginia received a record 40,815 applications, admitting 24 percent.[153][154] Approximately 40 percent of those admitted are non-white.[153] Matriculated students come from all 50 states and 147 foreign countries.[155][156] UVA is required, by Virginia state law, to matriculate two-thirds of its undergraduate student body from its pool of in-state applicants.[153] As a result, its acceptance rate for in-state students (36 percent) is nearly twice the out-of-state rate (19 percent) as of 2019.[153] The university has seen steady increases to its applicant pool in recent decades, and the number of applications has more than doubled since the Class of 2008 received 15,094 applications.[157] As of 2014, 93 percent of admitted applicants ranked in the top 10 percent of their high school classes.[156][158]\n\n\nAdmission is need-blind for domestic applicants.[159] President James Ryan announced at his inauguration in fall 2018 that in-state students from families earning less than $80,000 a year will receive full tuition scholarships.[72] Those from families earning less than $30,000 will also receive free room and board.[72] The university already met 100 percent of demonstrated need for all admitted undergraduate students, making it one of only two public universities in the U.S. to reach this level of financial aid for its students.[160][161] For 2014, the university ranked fourth overall by the *Princeton Review* for \"Great Financial Aid\".[162] In 2008 the Center for College Affordability and Productivity named UVA the top value among all national public colleges and universities; and in 2009, UVA was again named the \"No. 1 Best Value\" among public universities in the United States in a separate ranking by *USA TODAY* and the *Princeton Review.*[163][164][165] *Kiplinger* in 2014 ranked UVA second out of the top 100 best-value public colleges and universities in the nation.[166]\n\n\nGraduate and professional school admissions are also highly selective. As of 2019, the average LSAT score was 169 at the School of Law, while at the Darden School of Business the average GMAT score was 718.[167][168]\n\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\n\n\nStudent body composition as of May 2, 2022\n| Race and ethnicity[169] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| White | 56%\n | 56 |\n| Asian | 16%\n | 16 |\n| Other[g] | 10%\n | 10 |\n| Black | 7%\n | 7 |\n| Hispanic | 7%\n | 7 |\n| Foreign national | 4%\n | 4 |\n| Economic diversity |\n| Low-income[h] | 13%\n | 13 |\n| Affluent[i] | 87%\n | 87 |\n\n\nStudent life at the University of Virginia is marked by a number of unique traditions. The campus of the university is referred to as the \"Grounds\". Freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors are instead called first-, second-, third-, and fourth-years to reflect Jefferson's belief that learning is a lifelong process, rather than one to be completed within four years.\n\n\n\n![](image)William Faulkner once lived among the students of UVA after winning the Nobel Prize for Literature, and bequeathed most of his papers to Alderman Library.\n### Student-faculty interaction and connections[edit]\n\n\nProfessors are traditionally addressed as \"Mr.\" or \"Ms.\" at UVA instead of \"Doctor\" (although medical doctors are the one exception) in deference to Jefferson's desire to have an equality of ideas, discriminated by merit and unburdened by title. UVA facilitates close interactions between students and professors in a number of ways.\n\n\nFirst-year students in the College of Arts & Sciences have the opportunity to take two University Seminars, one per semester, which are later made available to other years students as well. These small classes, typically numbering from 4 to 19 students each, provide opportunities to work closely with professors at the university from the outset of a student's academic career. The small groupings also help facilitate more frequent and intense discussions between students in this closer environment.\n\n\nSelect faculty live at Brown College at Monroe Hill, Hereford College, International Residential College, and in Pavilions on the Lawn. This living arrangement gives more opportunities for professors to invite students to lunches and dinners, which regularly happens, and creates chances for impromptu meetings and interactions between faculty and students around Grounds.\n\n\nReflecting this close student-faculty interaction at UVA, it welcomed Nobel Laureate William Faulkner to a position as \"Writer-in-Residence\" in 1957.[170] He had no teaching responsibilities, and was paid merely to live among the students and write. He was badly injured in a horse riding accident in 1959, and did not return to the state before his death in 1962.[170] Faulkner then bequeathed the majority of his papers to Alderman Library, giving UVA the largest Faulkner archives in the world.[171]\n\n\n\n### Global citizenship initiatives[edit]\n\n\nThe International Residential College is a residential college at UVA that attracts and celebrates students from across the globe who choose to attend the university. It is one of the three major residential colleges at UVA. Students there come from 45 countries, representing 40% of the student population; but U.S. students are encouraged to live at the IRC as well to learn about the countries from which their classmates have journeyed to attend UVA.\n\n\nUVA was previously the academic sponsor for Semester at Sea, a multi-country study abroad program conducted on a cruise ship.\n\n\nThe University of Virginia received the 2015 Paul Simon Award for Comprehensive Internationalization, by the Association of International Educators.[172] This award confirms the university's success and commitment in educating its students on a global scale as well as nationally.[172]\n\n\n\n### Student leadership opportunities[edit]\n\n\nThere are a number of UVA undergraduate leadership opportunities that are offered in addition to the standard student government or fraternity and sorority positions found at many other universities. They include UVA's secret societies and debating societies, the student-run honor committees, and the chance to be recognized as a fourth-year student at the pinnacle of student leadership by being asked to live on the Lawn.\n\n\nThe Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy, established in 2007, expands on these unique student leadership opportunities to study Leadership itself as a cross-disciplinary subject of focus and is closely aligned with many of the university's schools, including the Architecture, Education, Engineering, Law, Medical, and Darden schools, as well as with programs in politics, economics, and applied ethics.\n\n\nThe University of Virginia has a long history of student activists who formed radical environmental, religious, and political groups to champion various social changes.[173] An especially intense period of student activism occurred in the 1970s during the May Days strikes against the Vietnam War.[174] More recently, the School of Education and Human Development and its Youth-Nex Center held a national conference in 2019 to promote student activism at UVA and beyond.[175]\n\n\n\n### Secret societies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Secret Societies at the University of Virginia\n\n![](image)The mark of one out of many secret societies active on Grounds at the university\nStudent societies have existed on Grounds since the early twentieth century. Secret societies have been a part of University of Virginia student life since the first class of students in 1825. While the number of societies peaked during the 75-year period between 1875 and 1950, there are still six societies active that are over 100 years old, and several newer secret societies.\n\n\n\n### Honor system[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Honor system at the University of Virginia\n\nHonor Pledge[176]\n\n\n> \n> On my honor, I have neither given nor received aid on this assignment.\n> \n> \n> \n>\n\nThe nation's first codified honor system was instituted by UVA law professor Henry St. George Tucker, Sr. in 1842, after a fellow professor was shot to death on the Lawn. There are three tenets to the system: students simply must not lie, cheat, or steal. For its first 180 years it was a \"single sanction system,\" meaning that committing any of these three offenses would result in immediate expulsion from the university. In the spring of 2022, following decades of criticism and waning support, a proposal to replace the penalty of expulsion with a two-semester suspension passed a student referendum with over 80% of the vote and took effect immediately.\n\n\nThe honor system is intended to be student-run and student-administered.[177] If accused, students are tried before their peersâfellow students, never faculty, serve as counsel and jury. Although Honor Committee resources have been strained by mass cheating scandals such as a case in 2001 of 122 suspected cheaters over several years in a single large Physics survey course, and federal lawsuits have challenged the system, its verdicts are rarely overturned.[178][179][180] There is only one documented case of direct UVA administration interference in an honor system proceeding: the trial and subsequent retrial of student Christopher Leggett.[181]\n\n\n\n### Student activities[edit]\n\n\nMany events take place at the University of Virginia, on the Lawn and across Grounds. One of the largest events at UVA is Springfest, hosted by the University Programs Council. It takes place every year in the spring, and features a large free concert, various inflatables, games. Another popular event and tradition is Lighting of the Lawn in the winter. Established in 2001 as a tribute to the September 11 Attacks, Lighting of the Lawn consists of a light and music show on the Lawn. Another popular event is Foxfield, a steeplechase and social gathering that takes place nearby in Albemarle County in April, and which is annually attended by thousands of students from the University of Virginia, neighboring colleges, and local residents.[182]\n\n\n\n![](image)The University Amphitheater is often used for outdoor lectures and student gatherings.\nThe student life building is called Newcomb Hall. It is home to the Student Activities Center (SAC) and the Media Activities Center (MAC), where student groups can get leadership consulting and use computing and copying resources, as well as several meeting rooms for student groups. Student Council, the student self-governing body, holds meetings Tuesdays at 6:30Â p.m. in the Newcomb South Meeting Room. Student Council, or \"StudCo\", also holds office hours and regular committee meetings in the newly renovated Newcomb Programs and Council (PAC) Room. The PAC also houses the University Programs Council and Class Councils. Newcomb basement is home to both the office of the independent student newspaper *The Declaration*, *The Cavalier Daily*, and the Consortium of University Publications.\n\n\nIn 2005, the university was named \"Hottest for Fitness\" by *Newsweek* magazine,[183] due in part to 94% of its students using one of the four indoor athletics facilities. Particularly popular is the Aquatics and Fitness Center, across the street from the Alderman Dorms. The University of Virginia sent more workers to the Peace Corps in 2006[184] and 2008[185] than any other \"medium-sized\" university in the United States. Volunteerism at the university is centered around Madison House which offers numerous opportunities to serve others. Among the numerous programs offered are tutoring, housing improvement, an organization called Hoos Against Hunger, which gives leftover food from restaurants to the homeless of Charlottesville rather than allowing it to be discarded, among numerous other volunteer programs.\n\n\nAs at many universities, alcohol use is a part of the social life of many undergraduate students. Concerns particularly arose about a past trend of fourth-years consuming excessive alcohol during the day of the last home football game.[186] President Casteen announced a $2.5Â million donation from Anheuser-Busch to fund a new UVA-based Social Norms Institute in September 2006.[187] A spokesman said: \"the goal is to get students to emulate the positive behavior of the vast majority of students\". On the other hand, the university was ranked first in *Playboy*'s 2012 list of Top 10 Party Schools based on ratings of sex, sports, and nightlife.[188]\n\n\n\n### Fraternities and sororities[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Fraternities and sororities at University of Virginia\n\nThe University of Virginia has a number of fraternities and sororities on campus, encompassing the traditional social fraternities and sororities as well as coeducational professional, service, and honor fraternities. Social life at the university was originally dominated by debating societies.[189] The first fraternity chapter founded at UVA was Delta Kappa Epsilon in 1852, and it was quickly followed by many more; the University of Virginia was the birthplace of two national fraternities, Kappa Sigma and Pi Kappa Alpha, which exist at the university as of 2023.[190][191][192]\n\n\nThrough the twentieth century, the roles of these organizations on campus expanded to encompass social sororities, professional fraternities and sororities, service fraternities, honor societies, black fraternities and sororities, and multicultural fraternities and sororities. Roughly 30% of the student body are members of social fraternities and sororities, while additional students are involved with service, professional, and honor fraternities.[193] \"Rush and pledging\" occur in the spring semester for most Greek organizations. Kappa Sigma and the Trigon Engineering Society hold reserved rooms on the Lawn, while Pi Kappa Alpha holds the only undergraduate room on the Range.[194]\n\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Northline Express (NLX) bus of the University Transit Service, with signage celebrating victory at the 2019 NCAA tournament championship (\"March Madness\")\nA set of bus lines operated by the university's University Transit Service connect different parts of the UVA Grounds with adjacent parking facilities. This is complemented by a set of bus lines operated by Charlottesville Area Transit that connect the University of Virginia with other parts of Charlottesville. The Virginia Department of Transportation maintains the roads through the university grounds as State Route 302.[195]\n\n\nCharlottesville Union Station is just 0.6 miles (0.97Â km) from UVA, and from there energy efficient Amtrak passenger trains serve Charlottesville on three routes: the *Cardinal* (Chicago to New York City), *Crescent* (New Orleans to New York City), and *Northeast Regional* (Virginia to Boston). The long-haul *Cardinal* operates three times a week, while the *Crescent* and *Northeast Regional* both run daily. CharlottesvilleâAlbemarle Airport, 8 miles (13Â km) away, has nonstop flights to Chicago, New York, Atlanta, Charlotte, and Philadelphia. The larger Richmond International Airport is 77 miles (124Â km) to the southeast, and the still larger Dulles International Airport is 99 miles (159Â km) to the northeast. They are accessible via Interstate 64 and U.S. 29, respectively, both of which are major highways and frequently trafficked.\n\n\nMegabus began serving Charlottesville with inexpensive direct express routes to and from Washington, D.C. in 2018.[196] Megabus also runs up to four trips per day from Charlottesville to New York City with several stops between.[197] Like the trains, the Megabus stop is at the nearby Amtrak station.[197]\n\n\n\n## Athletics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Virginia Cavaliers\n\nVirginia has ranked near the top of collegiate athletics programs in recent years. In 2015 and 2019, UVA won the nationwide Capital One Cup for overall men's sports excellence.[16] The teams and athletes representing Virginia in college athletics have been dubbed the *Cavaliers* since 1923, predating the NBA's Cleveland Cavaliers by nearly half a century.\n\n\nIn 2019, Virginia men's basketball won the NCAA Championship in \"March Madness\", the single-elimination national college basketball tournament considered by *YouGov* polled American viewers (as of the same year) to be the most exciting collegiate sporting event.[198][199] In 2015, when Virginia first won its first Capital One Cup its teams won the 2014 College Cup, the 2015 College World Series, and the 2015 NCAA Tennis Championships. When it repeated the feat in 2019, the program won both the March Madness tournament and the 2019 Men's Lacrosse Championship.\n\n\nVirginia's athletics director is Carla Williams, the first African American woman to hold the position at any power conference university. The previous athletics director was Craig Littlepage, the first African American to have that title in the ACC. He held the position for sixteen years and, under his leadership, UVA added many significant hires who have demonstrated success near the top of their respective sports, including recent NCAA Champions Tony Bennett, Lars Tiffany, Brian O'Connor, and Todd DeSorbo, as well as former football coach Bronco Mendenhall. Among coaches who have longer tenures, George Gelnovatch has won two NCAA men's soccer national titles since 2009. Steve Swanson has led women's soccer teams to six ACC titles and 24 consecutive winning seasons. Kevin Sauer has led UVA women's rowing to two NCAA titles since 2010.\n\n\n\n![](image)UVA lacrosse has won 11 national championships, including nine national titles since NCAA oversight began.\n### Championships[edit]\n\n\nIn the 21st century alone, UVA teams have won seventeen NCAA championships. The men's teams have won NCAA titles in basketball (2019); lacrosse (2003, 2006, 2011, 2019, and 2021); baseball (2015); soccer (2009 and 2014); and tennis (2013, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2022 and 2023). UVA women have won recent NCAA titles in rowing (2010 and 2012) and swimming & diving (2021, 2022 and 2023). The Cavaliers rank first in the ACC (a power conference) with 23 men's NCAA Championships, and rank second in the conference with ten women's NCAA Championships.\n\n\nUnder Tony Bennett the Cavaliers have experienced a basketball renaissance, winning the 2019 NCAA Championship, winning the ACC tournaments of 2014 (over Duke) and 2018 (over North Carolina), and winning regular-season championships in 2014, 2015, 2018, and 2019. UVA became the third program in ACC history to win 30 or more games in consecutive seasons and John Paul Jones Arena is considered one of the more intimidating trips for opposing teams to make. The women's basketball program fell just short of its own NCAA Championship in 1990, losing the Championship Game in overtime.\n\n\nThe Virginia men's and women's lacrosse programs are two of the most dominant in the history of the sport, winning ten of UVA's twenty-nine NCAA Championships between them and two more (for a total of 11 recognized national championships) before NCAA oversight began. 2019 and 2021 NCAA champion men's head coach Lars Tiffany has brought UVA back to prominence after Dom Starsia retired as the all-time ACC leader in men's lacrosse wins. All three UVA head coaches in the position prior to Tiffany still rank (as of 2019) in the top 20 of career wins. Three-time NCAA champion head coach Julie Myers leads women's lacrosse and under her guidance, Virginia is the only program to qualify for 24 straight NCAA tournament berths as of 2019.[200]\n\n\nThe Cavalier baseball team under Brian O'Connor has also experienced tremendous success. UVA finished as national runners-up in the 2014 College World Series and came back to win the 2015 College World Series. Virginia has hosted five NCAA Super Regional tournament events at Davenport Field.\n\n\nThe UVA men's tennis program won \"three-peat\" NCAA Championships in 2015â2017 after winning the Cavaliers' first in 2013. The team won back-to-back championships in 2022 and 2023. The program has regularly featured international talent combined with locally grown high school tennis talent from Virginia (often Northern Virginia).[201]\n\n\nThe University of Virginia women's cross country team won the 1981 and 1982 NCAA Women's Division I Cross Country Championship as well as the DI Indoor Championships.[202]\n\n\nThe women's swimming and diving team won its first NCAA Championship in 2021.[203] The women repeated the feat in both 2022[204] and 2023.[205]\n\n\n\n### Rivalries[edit]\n\n\nOfficial ACC designated rivalry games include the VirginiaâVirginia Tech rivalry and the VirginiaâLouisville series. These two rivalries are guaranteed an annual game in all sports, and a home-and-away series in men's and women's basketball. The Cavaliers competed against the Hokies in the *Commonwealth Challenge* and more recently competed in the *Commonwealth Clash*, under new rules, for many sports in which they compete head-to-head. The Cavaliers went 2â0 against the Hokies in the *Challenge* and 3â2 in the *Clash* (5â2 overall). Perhaps the two most significant rivalry games played between the Cavaliers and Hokies were both in men's basketball, on March 1, 2007, and January 15, 2019. In the former, the two teams met with identical 10â4 ACC records and the winner would clinch a share of the regular-season conference championship. UVA won the game 69â56 and took their fifth of ten ACC titles. In the latter, No. 4 UVA beat No. 9 Virginia Tech 81â59 in the only meeting between two AP Top 10 teams in the rivalry's history.\n\n\n\n![](image)Tony Bennett has a winning record against each of UVA's rivals.\nThe ACC is often regarded as the best college basketball conference,[206][207][208][209][210] and UVA leads the series in its official ACC basketball rivalries: against Virginia Tech 96â56, and Louisville 15â4, as of 2019[update]. A budding but lopsided series between Virginia's Tony Bennett and Louisville's Rick Pitino saw Bennett win 5 of 6 games before Pitino's Hall of Fame career ended in scandal at Louisville. Other notable basketball rivalries include those against North Carolina and Maryland. Notably the 1982 ACC tournament championship game where Dean Smith had his team of future NBA stars (such as Michael Jordan and James Worthy) hold the ball for seven minutes, against a Virginia team featuring Ralph Sampson, led to the advent of the shot clock and the three-point line. The Maryland rivalry is now mostly dormant, but was reignited for the 2014 and 2018 editions of the ACCâBig Ten Challenge, with both Challenges won by the Cavaliers on the road in College Park.\n\n\nVirginia men's lacrosse, as one of the all-time great NCAA programs, has a championship rivalry with fellow ACC program Syracuse (the Cavaliers and Orange holding 18 NCAA Championships between them) as well as rivalries against Big Ten programs Johns Hopkins and Maryland. The Syracuse and Johns Hopkins rivalries are played out at least once each season (Syracuse played *twice* in 2021[211]) with the teams often finding themselves facing off a second or third time in the ACC and NCAA tournaments. Virginia women's lacrosse, also a multi-NCAA Championship program, maintains several of those same rivalries.\n\n\nThe Virginia football team competes against North Carolina in the South's Oldest Rivalry, a historic football rivalry game which a sitting President of the United States, Calvin Coolidge, made time to attend in Charlottesville in 1924. The 1960s and 1970s were particularly dark decades for the football program, which later experienced a resurgence in the 1980s and 1990s under George Welsh. Coach Welsh led the program to its first bowl bids starting with the 1984 Peach Bowl. Welsh, who even reached AP No. 1 rankings for Virginia in October 1990, is a member of the College Football Hall of Fame after compiling the second-most wins in ACC history after Bobby Bowden.[212] In a historic rivalry between two legendary coaches, Welsh finished two games up in the head-to-head series against Virginia Tech coach Frank Beamer, 8â6. He was also dominant against UNC in the South's Oldest Rivalry, finishing 13â5â1, including a perfect 10â0 record against North Carolina at Scott Stadium.\n\n\n\n### Sponsorship[edit]\n\n\nIn 2015, The Cavaliers negotiated a 10-year sponsorship deal with Nike, from which the program receives $3.5Â million per year.[213]\n\n\n\n## People[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of University of Virginia people and List of University of Virginia School of Law alumni\n\n### Faculty[edit]\n\n\nMain category: University of Virginia faculty\n\nFaculty were originally housed in the Academical Village among the students, serving as both instructors and advisors, continuing on to include the McCormick Road Old Dorms, though this has been phased out in favor of undergraduate student resident advisors (RAs). Several of the faculty, however, continue the university tradition of living on Grounds, either on the Lawn in the various Pavilions, or as fellows at one of three residential colleges (Brown College at Monroe Hill, Hereford College, and the International Residential College).\n\n\nThe university's faculty includes a National Humanities Medal and National Medal of Arts winner and former United States Poet Laureate, an awardee of the Order of Isabella the Catholic,[214] 25 Guggenheim fellows, 26 Fulbright fellows, six National Endowment for the Humanities fellows, two Presidential Young Investigator Award winners, three Sloan award winners, three Packard Foundation Award winners, and a winner of the 2005 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.[215] Physics professor James McCarthy was the lead academic liaison to the government in the establishment of Suranet, and the university has also participated in ARPANET, Abilene, Internet2, and Lambda Rail. On March 19, 1986, the university's domain name, `VIRGINIA.EDU`, became the first registration under the `.edu` top-level domain originating from the Commonwealth of Virginia on what would become the World Wide Web.[216]\n\n\nLarry Sabato has, according to *The Wall Street Journal* and *The Washington Post*, become the most-cited professor in the country by national and regional news organizations, both on the Internet and in print.[217] Civil rights activist Julian Bond, a professor in the Corcoran Department of History from 1990 to 2012, was the chairman of the NAACP from 1998 to 2009 and was chosen to host the Nobel Laureates conference in 1998.\n\n\n\nFamous current and former UVA faculty and staff in residence\n![](image)\nTerry Belanger  \nFounder of the Rare Book School; MacArthur Genius Grant\n![](image)\nJulian Bond  \nCo-founder of Southern Poverty Law Center; Chairman of the NAACP\n![](image)\nJames Buchanan  \nFounder of Virginia school of political economy; Nobel Prize in Economics\n![](image)\nRita Dove  \nFirst African American United States Poet Laureate; Pulitzer Prize for Poetry\n![](image)\nWilliam Faulkner  \nNobel Prize in Literature and Pulitzer Prize for Fiction\n![](image)\nLarry Sabato  \nFounder of Center for Politics and *Larry Sabato's Crystal Ball*\n![](image)\nAntonin Scalia  \nAssociate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States\n![](image)\nKathryn Thornton  \nU.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame; former recordholder for most spacewalks by a woman\n\n### Alumni[edit]\n\n\nAs of December 2014[update], the University of Virginia has 221,000 living graduates.[131] According to a study by researchers at the Darden School and Stanford University, UVA alumni have founded over 65,000 companies which have employed 2.3Â million people worldwide with annual global revenues of $1.6Â trillion.[131] Extrapolated numbers show companies founded by UVA alumni have created 371,000 jobs in the state of Virginia alone.[131] The relatively small amount that the Commonwealth gives UVA for support was determined by the study to have a tremendous return on investment for the state.[131]\n\n\nRhodes Scholarships are international postgraduate awards given to students to study at the University of Oxford. Since the scholarship program began in 1904, UVA has had fifty-five Rhodes Scholars,[218] the most of any university in the American South, eighth-most overall, and third-most outside the Ivy League (behind Stanford University and the United States Military Academy (West Point)).[219]\n\n\nEight NASA astronauts and launch directors are UVA alumni: Karl Gordon Henize, Bill Nelson, Thomas Marshburn, Leland Melvin, Jeff Wisoff, Kathryn Thornton, Patrick Forrester; and Michael Leinbach.\n\n\nThe Pulitzer Prize has been awarded to eight UVA alumni: Edward P.

The investment yields a return that funds a portion of an institution's operational expenses while the principal exists in perpetuity. U.S. colleges and universities maintain some of the largest endowments in the world and make up the vast majority of higher education institutions with endowments greater than $1Â billion.\n\n\nThe National Association of College and University Business Officers (NACUBO) maintains information on endowments at U.S. higher education institutions by fiscal year (FY).[1] As of FY2022[update], the total endowment market value of U.S. institutions stood at $807.332 billion, with an average across all institutions of $1.185 billion and a median of $208.735 million.[2][3]\n\n\n\n\n## Enhancements and levies[edit]\n\n\nThe tabulated data below are from NACUBO. Some universities benefit from endowments that are not under their direct control but which are nonetheless dedicated to the welfare of one or several institutions. Examples of these foundations include The Duke Endowment, the Robert A. Welch Foundation, and the Roy J. Carver Charitable Trust.\n\n\nIn 2017, a federal endowment tax was enacted in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 in the form of an excise tax of 1.4% on institutions that have at least 500 tuition-paying students and net assets of at least $500,000 per student. The $500,000 is not adjusted for inflation, so the threshold is effectively lowered over time.[4][5]\n\n\nThe endowment tax provision of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has been criticized as funding tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy at the expense of education. Critics note that the tax could threaten financial aid for low-income students, stifle social mobility, and obstruct life-saving research.[6][7][8] Lobbyists representing wealthy private universities continue to advocate for its repeal.[9][10] The Don't Tax Higher Education Act, which would repeal the endowment tax, was introduced in the 115th United States Congress,[11] 116th United States Congress,[12] and 117th United States Congress[13] but died in the Ways and Means Committee each time.\n\n\n\n## Endowments greater than $1Â billion[edit]\n\n\n### Private schools[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Yale University has the second-largest endowment of all private colleges and universities in the United States.\n\n\n\n| Institution | State | Endowment[3](billions USD -

[4]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nBorn in 1962, Santa Ono is the son of mathematician Takashi Ono, who immigrated to the United States from Japan in the late 1950s. Ono was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, where his father worked as an assistant professor of mathematics at the University of British Columbia from 1961 to 1964. As a result, Ono acquired United States citizenship by *jus sanguinis* and Canadian citizenship by *jus soli*.[1] Ono was raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Towson, Maryland, where his father worked as a tenured professor at the University of Pennsylvania from 1964 to 1969 and at Johns Hopkins University from 1969 to 2011.[1][5]\n\n\nOno earned a Bachelor of Arts with a major in biological science from the University of Chicago in 1984 and a Doctor of Philosophy in experimental medicine from McGill University in Canada in 1991.[6]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### Science and research[edit]\n\n\nOno completed his postdoctoral fellowship at Harvard University supported by the Helen Hay Whitney Foundation[7] and then held faculty positions at Johns Hopkins University, Harvard University, University College London, and Emory University. He was GlaxoSmithKline Chair of Biomedical Science and head of the department of immunology at the University College London Institute of Ophthalmology and honorary staff member at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust.[8] From March 2006 until September 2008, he served as vice provost for academic initiatives and deputy to the provost at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. He was promoted to senior vice provost for undergraduate education and academic affairs of Emory University in September 2008 and also served as professor of ophthalmology, medicine, pediatrics and biology. In September 2010, he became senior vice president and provost for academic affairs at the University of Cincinnati.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Human Major Histocompatibility ComplexÂ : HLA region of Chromosome 6.

Allergic conjunctivitis involves mast cell-dependent inflammation in the mucosal surface (conjunctiva) of the eye. Macular degeneration results from photoreceptor death in the macula.\n![](image)Normal vision.\n![](image)The same view with age-related macular degeneration.\nOno has studied on ocular surface inflammation and the immune basis of age-related macular degeneration. His early work focused on the association of certain MHC haplotypes with susceptibility and resistance to type 1 diabetes. Using a number of recombinant and congenic rat strains, the work mapped susceptibility genes in the BB rat to the class II MHC loci. His work also showed that class I and II MHC gene products are expressed at higher levels or de novo on the insulin-producing beta cells of the islets of Langerhans.[9][10][11][12] He focused much of his research in the next decade on the regulation of MHC gene expression.[13] He showed that the different class II MHC isotypes are differentially expressed[14] and showed that the X2-box cis-element controls this differential expression.[15] His work also showed that the bZIP transcription factor: XBP1 forms a hetero-dimer with c-Fos.[16] This has turned out to be relevant to the developmental control of B cell differentiation. His lab also discovered the NFX1 transcription factor and cloned both the human and murine cDNAs.[17][18] This factor can bind DNA, RNA and protein via a reiterated RING finger motifs in the central domain of the polypeptide. The protein appears to have important roles in neuronal development and mRNA transport.[19][20] NFX1 is also a probable E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase.[21] These enzymes are of interest as they have been shown to participate in 3 metabolic pathways: ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, parkinson's disease, and huntington's disease. His lab also demonstrated that the non- histone chromosomal protein HMGA is required for the induction of multiple genes, including MHC genes, interferon-gamma and rhodopsin.[22][23][24][25] They mapped the interaction of HMGA1a and the paired homeodomain motif within Crx and showed that these interactions help recruit such transcriptional activators to the promoter/enhancer.[24][26]\n\n\nUsing transgenic mouse technology, they also showed (concurrently and independently of Alfredo Fusco), that fusion proteins between HMGA2 and other C terminal peptides (following chromosomal translocation) can drive the development of lipomas and generate obese mice.[27] Further contributions in the field include the mapping of the HMGA2 promoter/enhancer.[28][29]\n\n\nMore recently, his laboratory determined the role of beta-chemokines in mast cell-dependent inflammation in the ocular surface.[30][31] The work showed that chemokines not only contribute to leukocyte recruitment, but can cooperate with other mast cell activation signals to trigger mast cell degranulation.[32] Finally, his lab showed that certain autoantibodies might contribute to the pathogenesis or exacerbation of AMD and other rapid onset retinal degenerative diseases and may constitute useful biomarkers for the screening for AMD and its progression.[33][34]\n\n\n\n### Administrative work[edit]\n\n\nAt Harvard, he served as head of the Inflammation, Immunity and Transplantation Focus Group at the Schepens Eye Research Institute. There, he served on the executive committee of the Harvard Program in Immunology and on two NIH Training grants within ophthalmology (Ocular Immunology and Molecular Bases of Eye Diseases). He worked with the late president J. Wayne Streilein and COO Ken Trevett and others in developing a strategic plan for the Schepens Eye Research Institute at Harvard and helped attract funding from entities such as the Markey Charitable Trust and the Fidelity Investments.\n\n\nOno was then recruited to University College London to the Cumberlege Chair and then as GSK Professor. Major funding from the Wellcome Trust, Fight for Sight, and GSK supported the development of a new immunology division at the University College London-Institute of Ophthalmology which grew to 27 members.[35] While at UCL, he also took on administrative duties including as associate dean of students and as a member of the University College London Council (the university's governing board).[36]\n\n\nIn 2006, Ono moved to Emory University as senior vice provost for undergraduate education and academic affairs.[37] He had oversight of student enrollment activities, certain aspects of academic affairs and other responsibilities related to initiatives within the university strategic plan.\n\n\nIn June 2010, he was named senior vice president for academic affairs and university provost at the University of Cincinnati, with oversight of budgets, personnel, and planning.[38][39] During that time, he helped lead major initiatives, including Phase I of the university's Academic Master Plan which was released on April 11, 2011.[40]\n\n\nIn 2012, Ono was named the 28th president of the University of Cincinnati,[36] and became the first Asian-American president of that university and in the state of Ohio. At the University of Cincinnati, Ono lead the implementation of the Academic Master Plan that invested $100 million into academics at the institution, including strengthening advising, the Honors Program and Study Abroad. During his tenure the university completed a $1 billion capital campaign 5 months ahead of schedule. Considerable investment in the campus and surrounding area occurred during his tenure, including renovations of 6 colleges and of Nippert Stadium and Fifth Third Arena. U Square at the Loop, a $78 million mixed use development was opened during his presidency.[41] The University of Cincinnati also invested heavily in faculty recruitment, bringing more than 300 new faculty to the university in cluster hires.\n\n\nInside Higher Education named Ono America's most notable university president in 2015.[42] Upworthy has profiled him as one of 9 high-profile CEOs in the world who exemplify servant leadership.[43]\n\n\nOn June 15, 2016, Ono was named the 15th president and vice chancellor of the University of British Columbia in Canada, effective August 15.[44] He was re-appointed for a second five-year term on August 11, 2020.[45]\n\n\nOn July 13, 2022, Ono was named the 15th president of the University of Michigan in the United States. He became the first Asian American to lead the university when his five-year term began.[2][46]\n\n\n\n### Public communications[edit]\n\n\nOno has written on research and innovation,[47] college rankings,[48] healthcare,[49] STEM education,[50] diversity,[50] social media,[51] and more.[51]\n\n\nOno has also reached out to the public by giving talks at Kâ12 schools in the US, the UK and Canada and to the general public at the Royal Institution of Great Britain, where he gave talks to Kâ12 students in the Student Education program and to adult audiences in the Talking Points Evening Lecture Series.[52] He has also served as an invited panelist to discuss the Reith Lectures at Windsor Castle on BBC Radio 4.\n\n\nHe has spoken and written frequently on the issue of mental health in adolescents and young adults and advocated for enhanced funding for identifying at-risk youth and for early mental health interventions.[53][54]\n\n\nDuring his term as president of the University of Michigan, Santa Ono showed strong support against terrorism. Santa Ono condemned the Palestinian terrorist organization Hamas twice[55][56] and prevented tearing down posters of Israeli hostages hang around the campus.[57]\n\n\n\n## Honors and awards[edit]\n\n\nOno received an honorary doctorate degree from Chiba University in Japan in 2016[58] and an honorary doctor of divinity from the Vancouver School of Theology of the University of British Columbia in 2020.[59]\n\n\nOno is the recipient of the Pharmacia International Award in Allergy Research (the top international prize awarded to inflammation researchers under the age of 40), a Helen Hay Whitney Fellowship, the American Diabetes Association Career Development Award, the Arthritis Foundation Investigator Award, a Lucille P. Markey Charitable Trust Award, the Medal in Bronze from Osaka City University and the Roche Award presented at University of Texas Medical Branch.\n\n\nIn 2016, he was awarded the Reginald Wilson Diversity Leadership Award from the American Council on Education and the NAAAP100 Award from the National Association of Asian American Professionals. In 2017, he received a Professional Achievement Award from the University of Chicago Alumni Association.[60] He has been recognized as an outstanding mentor at Phi Beta Kappa ceremonies and received the JW McConnell Award for Potential in Teaching at McGill University.\n\n\nOno was elected into the American Academy of Arts & Sciences in 2022 [61] He has also been elected a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the National Academy of Inventors, the Johns Hopkins Society of Scholars, the Royal Society of Medicine, the Royal Society of Chemistry and Fellow of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. He was elected International Fellow, American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology and of the Collegium Internationale Allergologicum and in 2017 the Canadian Academy of Health Sciences.[62] He has been a member of the Faculty of 1000 since 2003.[63]\n\n\nHe has delivered plenary or major lectures at: the International Congress of Immunology, the International Congress of Eye Research, the Annual Meetings of ARVO and AAAAI and the Kyoto Cornea Conference. Ono has been a Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Visiting Professor at Kyoto University and a Genentech Visiting Professor at the University of Cincinnati.\n\n\n\n## Advisory roles[edit]\n\n\nOn January 23, 2017, Ono was appointed chief advisor of the British Columbia Innovation Network and a member of the British Columbia Technology Council.[64]\n\n\nOno has served on the governing bodies/board of trustees of University College London, Intervarsity Christian Fellowship US, World Affairs Council of Cincinnati, Alois Alzheimer Center, Strive for College, the Japan America Society, the Taft Center at University of Cincinnati, the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, University of Cincinnati Foundation and Trent School Cockfosters, Church of England.

[4]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nBorn in 1962, Santa Ono is the son of mathematician Takashi Ono, who immigrated to the United States from Japan in the late 1950s. Ono was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, where his father worked as an assistant professor of mathematics at the University of British Columbia from 1961 to 1964. As a result, Ono acquired United States citizenship by *jus sanguinis* and Canadian citizenship by *jus soli*.[1] Ono was raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Towson, Maryland, where his father worked as a tenured professor at the University of Pennsylvania from 1964 to 1969 and at Johns Hopkins University from 1969 to 2011.[1][5]\n\n\nOno earned a Bachelor of Arts with a major in biological science from the University of Chicago in 1984 and a Doctor of Philosophy in experimental medicine from McGill University in Canada in 1991.[6]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### Science and research[edit]\n\n\nOno completed his postdoctoral fellowship at Harvard University supported by the Helen Hay Whitney Foundation[7] and then held faculty positions at Johns Hopkins University, Harvard University, University College London, and Emory University. He was GlaxoSmithKline Chair of Biomedical Science and head of the department of immunology at the University College London Institute of Ophthalmology and honorary staff member at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust.[8] From March 2006 until September 2008, he served as vice provost for academic initiatives and deputy to the provost at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. He was promoted to senior vice provost for undergraduate education and academic affairs of Emory University in September 2008 and also served as professor of ophthalmology, medicine, pediatrics and biology. In September 2010, he became senior vice president and provost for academic affairs at the University of Cincinnati.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Human Major Histocompatibility ComplexÂ : HLA region of Chromosome 6.

Allergic conjunctivitis involves mast cell-dependent inflammation in the mucosal surface (conjunctiva) of the eye. Macular degeneration results from photoreceptor death in the macula.\n![](image)Normal vision.\n![](image)The same view with age-related macular degeneration.\nOno has studied on ocular surface inflammation and the immune basis of age-related macular degeneration. His early work focused on the association of certain MHC haplotypes with susceptibility and resistance to type 1 diabetes. Using a number of recombinant and congenic rat strains, the work mapped susceptibility genes in the BB rat to the class II MHC loci. His work also showed that class I and II MHC gene products are expressed at higher levels or de novo on the insulin-producing beta cells of the islets of Langerhans.[9][10][11][12] He focused much of his research in the next decade on the regulation of MHC gene expression.[13] He showed that the different class II MHC isotypes are differentially expressed[14] and showed that the X2-box cis-element controls this differential expression.[15] His work also showed that the bZIP transcription factor: XBP1 forms a hetero-dimer with c-Fos.[16] This has turned out to be relevant to the developmental control of B cell differentiation. His lab also discovered the NFX1 transcription factor and cloned both the human and murine cDNAs.[17][18] This factor can bind DNA, RNA and protein via a reiterated RING finger motifs in the central domain of the polypeptide. The protein appears to have important roles in neuronal development and mRNA transport.[19][20] NFX1 is also a probable E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase.[21] These enzymes are of interest as they have been shown to participate in 3 metabolic pathways: ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, parkinson's disease, and huntington's disease. His lab also demonstrated that the non- histone chromosomal protein HMGA is required for the induction of multiple genes, including MHC genes, interferon-gamma and rhodopsin.[22][23][24][25] They mapped the interaction of HMGA1a and the paired homeodomain motif within Crx and showed that these interactions help recruit such transcriptional activators to the promoter/enhancer.[24][26]\n\n\nUsing transgenic mouse technology, they also showed (concurrently and independently of Alfredo Fusco), that fusion proteins between HMGA2 and other C terminal peptides (following chromosomal translocation) can drive the development of lipomas and generate obese mice.[27] Further contributions in the field include the mapping of the HMGA2 promoter/enhancer.[28][29]\n\n\nMore recently, his laboratory determined the role of beta-chemokines in mast cell-dependent inflammation in the ocular surface.[30][31] The work showed that chemokines not only contribute to leukocyte recruitment, but can cooperate with other mast cell activation signals to trigger mast cell degranulation.[32] Finally, his lab showed that certain autoantibodies might contribute to the pathogenesis or exacerbation of AMD and other rapid onset retinal degenerative diseases and may constitute useful biomarkers for the screening for AMD and its progression.[33][34]\n\n\n\n### Administrative work[edit]\n\n\nAt Harvard, he served as head of the Inflammation, Immunity and Transplantation Focus Group at the Schepens Eye Research Institute. There, he served on the executive committee of the Harvard Program in Immunology and on two NIH Training grants within ophthalmology (Ocular Immunology and Molecular Bases of Eye Diseases). He worked with the late president J. Wayne Streilein and COO Ken Trevett and others in developing a strategic plan for the Schepens Eye Research Institute at Harvard and helped attract funding from entities such as the Markey Charitable Trust and the Fidelity Investments.\n\n\nOno was then recruited to University College London to the Cumberlege Chair and then as GSK Professor. Major funding from the Wellcome Trust, Fight for Sight, and GSK supported the development of a new immunology division at the University College London-Institute of Ophthalmology which grew to 27 members.[35] While at UCL, he also took on administrative duties including as associate dean of students and as a member of the University College London Council (the university's governing board).[36]\n\n\nIn 2006, Ono moved to Emory University as senior vice provost for undergraduate education and academic affairs.[37] He had oversight of student enrollment activities, certain aspects of academic affairs and other responsibilities related to initiatives within the university strategic plan.\n\n\nIn June 2010, he was named senior vice president for academic affairs and university provost at the University of Cincinnati, with oversight of budgets, personnel, and planning.[38][39] During that time, he helped lead major initiatives, including Phase I of the university's Academic Master Plan which was released on April 11, 2011.[40]\n\n\nIn 2012, Ono was named the 28th president of the University of Cincinnati,[36] and became the first Asian-American president of that university and in the state of Ohio. At the University of Cincinnati, Ono lead the implementation of the Academic Master Plan that invested $100 million into academics at the institution, including strengthening advising, the Honors Program and Study Abroad. During his tenure the university completed a $1 billion capital campaign 5 months ahead of schedule. Considerable investment in the campus and surrounding area occurred during his tenure, including renovations of 6 colleges and of Nippert Stadium and Fifth Third Arena. U Square at the Loop, a $78 million mixed use development was opened during his presidency.[41] The University of Cincinnati also invested heavily in faculty recruitment, bringing more than 300 new faculty to the university in cluster hires.\n\n\nInside Higher Education named Ono America's most notable university president in 2015.[42] Upworthy has profiled him as one of 9 high-profile CEOs in the world who exemplify servant leadership.[43]\n\n\nOn June 15, 2016, Ono was named the 15th president and vice chancellor of the University of British Columbia in Canada, effective August 15.[44] He was re-appointed for a second five-year term on August 11, 2020.[45]\n\n\nOn July 13, 2022, Ono was named the 15th president of the University of Michigan in the United States. He became the first Asian American to lead the university when his five-year term began.[2][46]\n\n\n\n### Public communications[edit]\n\n\nOno has written on research and innovation,[47] college rankings,[48] healthcare,[49] STEM education,[50] diversity,[50] social media,[51] and more.[51]\n\n\nOno has also reached out to the public by giving talks at Kâ12 schools in the US, the UK and Canada and to the general public at the Royal Institution of Great Britain, where he gave talks to Kâ12 students in the Student Education program and to adult audiences in the Talking Points Evening Lecture Series.[52] He has also served as an invited panelist to discuss the Reith Lectures at Windsor Castle on BBC Radio 4.\n\n\nHe has spoken and written frequently on the issue of mental health in adolescents and young adults and advocated for enhanced funding for identifying at-risk youth and for early mental health interventions.[53][54]\n\n\nDuring his term as president of the University of Michigan, Santa Ono showed strong support against terrorism. Santa Ono condemned the Palestinian terrorist organization Hamas twice[55][56] and prevented tearing down posters of Israeli hostages hang around the campus.[57]\n\n\n\n## Honors and awards[edit]\n\n\nOno received an honorary doctorate degree from Chiba University in Japan in 2016[58] and an honorary doctor of divinity from the Vancouver School of Theology of the University of British Columbia in 2020.[59]\n\n\nOno is the recipient of the Pharmacia International Award in Allergy Research (the top international prize awarded to inflammation researchers under the age of 40), a Helen Hay Whitney Fellowship, the American Diabetes Association Career Development Award, the Arthritis Foundation Investigator Award, a Lucille P. Markey Charitable Trust Award, the Medal in Bronze from Osaka City University and the Roche Award presented at University of Texas Medical Branch.\n\n\nIn 2016, he was awarded the Reginald Wilson Diversity Leadership Award from the American Council on Education and the NAAAP100 Award from the National Association of Asian American Professionals. In 2017, he received a Professional Achievement Award from the University of Chicago Alumni Association.[60] He has been recognized as an outstanding mentor at Phi Beta Kappa ceremonies and received the JW McConnell Award for Potential in Teaching at McGill University.\n\n\nOno was elected into the American Academy of Arts & Sciences in 2022 [61] He has also been elected a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the National Academy of Inventors, the Johns Hopkins Society of Scholars, the Royal Society of Medicine, the Royal Society of Chemistry and Fellow of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. He was elected International Fellow, American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology and of the Collegium Internationale Allergologicum and in 2017 the Canadian Academy of Health Sciences.[62] He has been a member of the Faculty of 1000 since 2003.[63]\n\n\nHe has delivered plenary or major lectures at: the International Congress of Immunology, the International Congress of Eye Research, the Annual Meetings of ARVO and AAAAI and the Kyoto Cornea Conference. Ono has been a Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Visiting Professor at Kyoto University and a Genentech Visiting Professor at the University of Cincinnati.\n\n\n\n## Advisory roles[edit]\n\n\nOn January 23, 2017, Ono was appointed chief advisor of the British Columbia Innovation Network and a member of the British Columbia Technology Council.[64]\n\n\nOno has served on the governing bodies/board of trustees of University College London, Intervarsity Christian Fellowship US, World Affairs Council of Cincinnati, Alois Alzheimer Center, Strive for College, the Japan America Society, the Taft Center at University of Cincinnati, the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, University of Cincinnati Foundation and Trent School Cockfosters, Church of England.

From 2014 to June 2020, he was the 15th president of Ohio State University. From 2005 to 2014, he was the chancellor of the University of California, Irvine and prior to that served as vice president for health affairs for the University of California system.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nMichael V. Drake was born in New York City and raised in Englewood, New Jersey, and Sacramento, California.[2] He is the son of a doctor and a social worker. His mother graduated from East High School in Youngstown, Ohio, before attending college in Baltimore. The family lived in Baltimore, Nashville, Tennessee, New York, and New Jersey before settling in Northern California. He graduated from C.K. McClatchy High School at Sacramento, California in 1967.[3] During college summers in the early 1970s, he worked at the original Tower Records.[4]\n\n\nDrake attended Sacramento City College from 1967 to 1969. He received a Bachelor of Arts from Stanford University in 1974 and a Doctor of Medicine and residency training from the University of California, San Francisco in 1975. He completed an Advanced Management Program at Harvard Business School in 2005.[5][6]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nDrake spent more than two decades on the faculty of the UCSF School of Medicine, ultimately becoming the Steven P. Shearing Professor of Ophthalmology and senior associate dean. He then served for five years as vice president for health affairs for the University of California system. From July 2005 to June 2014, Drake served as chancellor of the University of California, Irvine. He also served as a professor of ophthalmology (School of Medicine) and Education (School of Education).[7]\n\n\n\n### University of California, Irvine chancellorship[edit]\n\n\nIn 2005, Drake was appointed as the fifth chancellor of the University of California, Irvine (UCI). He officially began his term on July 1, 2005.[8][9] His annual $350,000 salary remained unchanged from his previous position at the Office of the President.[*dead link*] As of 2010 he earned $374,969.32.[10]\n\n\n\n### Ohio State University presidency[edit]\n\n\nOn January 30, 2014, the Ohio State University Board of Trustees named Drake as the 15th president of Ohio State University. He began his tenure at the university on June 30, 2014.[11] At the time of his appointment, he was part of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Institute of Medicine, and the board of directors of NCAA Division I.[12] In March 2015, Drake was appointed to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame board.[13]\n\n\nIn November 2019, the university announced that Drake would retire in 2020.[14]\n\n\n\n### University of California presidency[edit]\n\n\nOn July 7, 2020, Drake was selected as the 21st president of the University of California system, making him the first Black president in UC's 152-year history.[15]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nDrake is married to Brenda Drake. An alumna of Stanford and Berkeley Law, Brenda Drake is an attorney and has served as a director or trustee of organizations focused on education, international health, finance, civil rights and the arts, including the National Urban League, City Arts & Lectures in San Francisco, San Francisco University High School and Golden Gate Bank.[16] She is a director emerita and former board chair of Engender Health Inc., an international women's health organization, and is currently a trustee of the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive.[17][18] Drake and his wife have two adult sons and four grandchildren.\n\n\nDrake's first job was working at Tower Records. He is quoted as saying he has a \"passion for music, which is still a hobby today\".[19] In 2015, Drake was appointed to the board of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, Inc. He has had a lifelong interest in music (notably rock and jazz), plays guitar, and teaches an undergraduate course on the music of the civil rights movement.[20]\n\n\n\n### Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, Dr. Drake led the establishment of the Ohio State Tuition Guarantee, which freezes tuition, mandatory fees, housing and dining for four years for incoming, in-state freshmen. He also increased the value of Ohio State Land Grant Opportunity Scholarships to cover the full cost of attendance while doubling the size of the program in 2018.[21]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\n* In 2017, he and his wife, Brenda, were awarded the 10th Annual King Arts Legends & Legacies Award as well as the University of California-Irvine Medal, joining past honorees ranging from U.S. presidents to Ella Fitzgerald.[20]\n* Member of the Columbus Partnership[22]\n* Michael J. Hogan Award (laboratory science)[23]\n\n\n## Professional decisions[edit]\n\n\n### Chemerinsky firing and rehiring[edit]\n\n\nSee also: University of California, Irvine School of Law Â§Â Chemerinsky hiring controversy\n\nDrake's first major firing scandal was to fire the Dean of the UCI law school, Erwin Chemerinsky. After Chemerinsky signed a contract on September 4, 2007, Drake rescinded the offer because he felt the law professor's commentaries were \"polarizing\"; Drake claimed the decision was his own and not the subject of any outside influence.[24]\n\n\nThe action was criticized by both liberal and conservative scholars who felt it hindered the academic mission of the law school and violated principles of academic freedom. Few believed Drake's claims that it was not the result of outside influence.[24][25] The issue was the subject of an editorial in *The New York Times* on September 14, 2007.[26] Details emerged revealing that UCI had received criticism on the hire from the California Supreme Court's then-Chief Justice Ronald M. George, who criticized Chemerinsky's grasp of death penalty appeals, as well as a group of prominent local Republicans who wanted to stop the appointment, including Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich. Drake traveled over a weekend to meet with Chemerinsky in Durham, North Carolina, where Chemerinsky was a professor at the Duke University School of Law at the time, and the two reached an agreement.[27] On September 17, Chemerinsky issued a joint press release with Drake indicating that Chemerinsky would head the UCI law school.[28] On September 20, 2007, Chemerinsky's hire was formally approved by the Regents of the University of California.[29] In 2014, Chemerinsky said that he and Drake had since reconciled.[30]\n\n\n\n### Waters firing[edit]\n\n\nSee also: The Ohio State University Marching Band Â§Â 2014 hazing scandal\n\nDrake fired Ohio State marching band director Jon Waters on July 24, 2014,[31] after a university investigation found that the band's \"sexualized culture\" was \"inconsistent with the University's values and Title IX requirements\". The university stated that there were \"serious cultural issues and an environment conducive to sexual harassment within the Marching Band\", and that the band director \"was aware or reasonably should have known about\" it.[32] Waters sued for reinstatement, accusing the university, Drake, and a provost of discriminating against him by disciplining him differently than a female employee and denying him due process.[33][34][35][36] Drake has stood by his decision to terminate Waters as marching band director.[37] As of January 2015, the university had spent nearly $1 million in defense of the decision and subsequent actions.[38]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Date information sourced from Library of Congress Authorities data, via corresponding WorldCat IdentitiesÂ linked authority file (LAF).\n2. **^** \"Michael V.

From 2014 to June 2020, he was the 15th president of Ohio State University. From 2005 to 2014, he was the chancellor of the University of California, Irvine and prior to that served as vice president for health affairs for the University of California system.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nMichael V. Drake was born in New York City and raised in Englewood, New Jersey, and Sacramento, California.[2] He is the son of a doctor and a social worker. His mother graduated from East High School in Youngstown, Ohio, before attending college in Baltimore. The family lived in Baltimore, Nashville, Tennessee, New York, and New Jersey before settling in Northern California. He graduated from C.K. McClatchy High School at Sacramento, California in 1967.[3] During college summers in the early 1970s, he worked at the original Tower Records.[4]\n\n\nDrake attended Sacramento City College from 1967 to 1969. He received a Bachelor of Arts from Stanford University in 1974 and a Doctor of Medicine and residency training from the University of California, San Francisco in 1975. He completed an Advanced Management Program at Harvard Business School in 2005.[5][6]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nDrake spent more than two decades on the faculty of the UCSF School of Medicine, ultimately becoming the Steven P. Shearing Professor of Ophthalmology and senior associate dean. He then served for five years as vice president for health affairs for the University of California system. From July 2005 to June 2014, Drake served as chancellor of the University of California, Irvine. He also served as a professor of ophthalmology (School of Medicine) and Education (School of Education).[7]\n\n\n\n### University of California, Irvine chancellorship[edit]\n\n\nIn 2005, Drake was appointed as the fifth chancellor of the University of California, Irvine (UCI). He officially began his term on July 1, 2005.[8][9] His annual $350,000 salary remained unchanged from his previous position at the Office of the President.[*dead link*] As of 2010 he earned $374,969.32.[10]\n\n\n\n### Ohio State University presidency[edit]\n\n\nOn January 30, 2014, the Ohio State University Board of Trustees named Drake as the 15th president of Ohio State University. He began his tenure at the university on June 30, 2014.[11] At the time of his appointment, he was part of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Institute of Medicine, and the board of directors of NCAA Division I.[12] In March 2015, Drake was appointed to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame board.[13]\n\n\nIn November 2019, the university announced that Drake would retire in 2020.[14]\n\n\n\n### University of California presidency[edit]\n\n\nOn July 7, 2020, Drake was selected as the 21st president of the University of California system, making him the first Black president in UC's 152-year history.[15]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nDrake is married to Brenda Drake. An alumna of Stanford and Berkeley Law, Brenda Drake is an attorney and has served as a director or trustee of organizations focused on education, international health, finance, civil rights and the arts, including the National Urban League, City Arts & Lectures in San Francisco, San Francisco University High School and Golden Gate Bank.[16] She is a director emerita and former board chair of Engender Health Inc., an international women's health organization, and is currently a trustee of the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive.[17][18] Drake and his wife have two adult sons and four grandchildren.\n\n\nDrake's first job was working at Tower Records. He is quoted as saying he has a \"passion for music, which is still a hobby today\".[19] In 2015, Drake was appointed to the board of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, Inc. He has had a lifelong interest in music (notably rock and jazz), plays guitar, and teaches an undergraduate course on the music of the civil rights movement.[20]\n\n\n\n### Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, Dr. Drake led the establishment of the Ohio State Tuition Guarantee, which freezes tuition, mandatory fees, housing and dining for four years for incoming, in-state freshmen. He also increased the value of Ohio State Land Grant Opportunity Scholarships to cover the full cost of attendance while doubling the size of the program in 2018.[21]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\n* In 2017, he and his wife, Brenda, were awarded the 10th Annual King Arts Legends & Legacies Award as well as the University of California-Irvine Medal, joining past honorees ranging from U.S. presidents to Ella Fitzgerald.[20]\n* Member of the Columbus Partnership[22]\n* Michael J. Hogan Award (laboratory science)[23]\n\n\n## Professional decisions[edit]\n\n\n### Chemerinsky firing and rehiring[edit]\n\n\nSee also: University of California, Irvine School of Law Â§Â Chemerinsky hiring controversy\n\nDrake's first major firing scandal was to fire the Dean of the UCI law school, Erwin Chemerinsky. After Chemerinsky signed a contract on September 4, 2007, Drake rescinded the offer because he felt the law professor's commentaries were \"polarizing\"; Drake claimed the decision was his own and not the subject of any outside influence.[24]\n\n\nThe action was criticized by both liberal and conservative scholars who felt it hindered the academic mission of the law school and violated principles of academic freedom. Few believed Drake's claims that it was not the result of outside influence.[24][25] The issue was the subject of an editorial in *The New York Times* on September 14, 2007.[26] Details emerged revealing that UCI had received criticism on the hire from the California Supreme Court's then-Chief Justice Ronald M. George, who criticized Chemerinsky's grasp of death penalty appeals, as well as a group of prominent local Republicans who wanted to stop the appointment, including Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich. Drake traveled over a weekend to meet with Chemerinsky in Durham, North Carolina, where Chemerinsky was a professor at the Duke University School of Law at the time, and the two reached an agreement.[27] On September 17, Chemerinsky issued a joint press release with Drake indicating that Chemerinsky would head the UCI law school.[28] On September 20, 2007, Chemerinsky's hire was formally approved by the Regents of the University of California.[29] In 2014, Chemerinsky said that he and Drake had since reconciled.[30]\n\n\n\n### Waters firing[edit]\n\n\nSee also: The Ohio State University Marching Band Â§Â 2014 hazing scandal\n\nDrake fired Ohio State marching band director Jon Waters on July 24, 2014,[31] after a university investigation found that the band's \"sexualized culture\" was \"inconsistent with the University's values and Title IX requirements\". The university stated that there were \"serious cultural issues and an environment conducive to sexual harassment within the Marching Band\", and that the band director \"was aware or reasonably should have known about\" it.[32] Waters sued for reinstatement, accusing the university, Drake, and a provost of discriminating against him by disciplining him differently than a female employee and denying him due process.[33][34][35][36] Drake has stood by his decision to terminate Waters as marching band director.[37] As of January 2015, the university had spent nearly $1 million in defense of the decision and subsequent actions.[38]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Date information sourced from Library of Congress Authorities data, via corresponding WorldCat IdentitiesÂ linked authority file (LAF).\n2. **^** \"Michael V.
